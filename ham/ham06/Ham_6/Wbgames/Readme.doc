                            WORKBENCH GAME COLLECTION 1

Release V2.2

Included in this directory are 5 workbench games, they are not the registered
versions and hence will not save the highscore table and they will only allow
you to play two games before they auto quit.

If you want to register these games then send me a cheque or postal order for
£5 and a SAE.

These games have been tested on:
                               A1200 standard
                               A1200 6MB
                               A4000 68030

These games should work on any workbench 2+ machine but I have not tried them!
If you have any problems please write to me,or email me at cs93kc@dcs.exeter.ac.uk

Bugs Fixed:
            Sound sometimes screwed up on slow Amigas.
            Window placement and sizing messed up with non default System font.
            Some minor adjustments to Toe_Popper GUI/Menu handling.
