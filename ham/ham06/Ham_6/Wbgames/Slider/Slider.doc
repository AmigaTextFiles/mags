1. Rules

The idea of Slider is to arrange the tiles so that they are in the order that they
were in before the computer scrambled them.


2. Controls

The controls are as follows:

Use the left mouse button to click on the tile you want to move into the empty
space, you can move more than one tile at a time.
The menu has an option to change the size of the puzzle.


3. Additional Information

This program will only work on WB 2.0 and above.

This program was written on an Amiga A1200 68882 6MB.

This program was intended to be used with the workbench in 8 colour
mode although it can be used in 4 it won't look as good!

The high score table will be loaded and saved from the directory in which
the game is stored if the file is not there a default table will be used.

The game window graphics will scale themselves to your screens aspect ratio.

The sound can be turned off and on by altering the tool type.

BUGS!!!!!!!
None known at present.
