 About Yatcy
 -----------

 Yatcy a game of Dice for 1 to 4 players. Each player must roll the dice and
depending on the outcome reroll any of the five dice upto two more times.
Then the player must decide which empty box on His/Her scorecard they wish
the rolls to count for. Players take it in turns when playing to roll for a
score box.

 Scoreing is as follows.

 Ones              - The final amount of ones showing times 1. ie if there
                     are three dice showing ones then the score is 3*1=3.

 Two's             - The final amount of Two's showing times 2. ie if there
                     are Four dice showing Two's then the score is 4*2=8.

 Threes            - The final amount of Threes showing times 3. ie if there
                     are three dice showing threes then the score is 3*3=9.

 Fours             - The final amount of Fours showing times 4. ie if there
                     are Two dice showing Fours then the score is 2*4=8.

 Fives             - The final amount of Fives showing times 5. ie if there
                     are three dice showing Fives then the score is 3*5=15.

 Sixes             - The final amount of Sixes showing times 1. ie if there
                     are three dice showing Sixes then the score is 3*6=18.

 Upper Total       - This is the total of the above six boxes.

 Bonus             - Here 30 Bonus points are awarded if the Upper Total is
                     more than 62.


 Three of a kind   - Here you must achieve three dice of the same number ie.
                     Three Fives, now the total of all the dice points are
                     added to give the score ie. If you roll Three Fives, a
                     Six and a Two. Then you score 5+5+5+6+2=23

 Four of a kind    - As above but you must roll Four dice of the same face
                     value. ie 5+5+5+5+2=22

 Full House        - Here you must Roll three dice with the same face value,
                     and the remaining two dice must also have the same face
                     value but different than the first three dice. This
                     scores an automatic 25 points. ie 5+5+5+3+3=25

 Short Straight    - Here you must roll a run of four dice, ie One,Two,Three,
                     Four.  It does not matter the face value of the
                     remaining die. This scores an automatic 30 points.

 Long Straight     - As above but you must roll a run using all five dice.
                     ie. One,Two,Three,Four,Five. The only other possibility
                     is to roll Two,Three,Four,Five,Six. This scores an
                     automatic 40 points.

                     must roll five dice with the same face value. This
                     scores an automatic score of 50 points.

 Chance            - This is a spare score box. The face value of all five
                     dice are added together to give you your score. It does
                     not matter which face values you have but obviously the
                     higher the better. ie 1+2+3+5+6=17

                     added together as well as the Bonus if one was awarded.



 If you fail to reach the requirements for any of the score boxes then an
automatic score of 0 is awarded. You can complete the score boxes in any
order you wish and when all boxes are filled then is the game over. The
player with the highest score is the winner. You can also play alone to try
and beat your own personal score, or maybe even my score, that I have scored
without cheating whilst play testing the game. This was 335. scored as so:

 This is from a maximum possible score of 370. I managed Four Yatcy's in one

tell you at the end of your game when your score is judged and commented on.
