@endnode

@node welcome

	@{b}Welcome to the wonderful world of juggling!@{ub}

	A warning may be appropriate: Juggling can become an
	addiction! :)

	This little course consists of seven steps, and after
	following these steps, spending an hour or two of your
	invaluable time, you are actually juggling!

	When needed, pictures are included to clarify the text.
	(Ehh... Not allways, sorry!)

	If you learn the basic cascade, there are some tricks to
	deal with.

	@{b}Some things to think about before you begin:@{ub}

	*       Make sure you have three balls :) Tennis balls are ok
		but a little difficult for beginners because they will
		bounce out of your hands. Try finding some heavier
		balls to start with. Best of all, if you are just a
		little bit serious about juggling, buy real juggling
		balls. Beanbags are best for practise.

		You can make beanbags yourself. Maybe I'll include a
		description of that too, sometime... I haven't done
		any beanbags myself.

	*       Make room. You ARE going to drop. Put away that
		antique vase you got from from your grandma'... :)

	*       Make sure that nobody disturb you.

	*       Try to concentrate on the juggling!
	
	*       Have fun! (This is really important!)

	@{b}THE 'THREE BALL CASCADE'
	************************@{ub}

	@{"  " link Step1.ilbm/main}  Step 1

	Hold one ball in either of your hands. Throw the ball in an
	arc from about waist height to your other hand. Say 'Throw'
	when you throw it and 'Catch' when you catch it. Easy! Now
	throw it back in the same way. You are now juggling one
	ball! :)
	
	Try this for about five minutes, until you think you can throw
	the same height and distance all the time. Only look slightly
	at the ball when it peaks.

	
	@{"  " link Step2.ilbm/main}  Step 2

	Now take two balls, one in each hand. Begin throwing with your
	weakest hand and throw to the other hand. When that ball
	peaks, throw the other ball in the same manner. Say 'throw,
	throw, catch, catch'. Practice 'til you can make ten throws
	without dropping.


	3.

	Same as step two but change the hand you start with.
	No need for a pic here...

	
	4.

	Take two balls in your best hand and one in the other.
	Repeat step two and three and let the third ball lie in your
	hand, watching the other two balls having fun :) Stick it
	between your thumb, third and fourth finger (the little finger
	and the one next to it). In other words, just forget about the
	third ball for the moment.

	
	@{"  " link Step5.ilbm/main}  Step 5

	NOTE: The dotted line represents
	the past, in this example the red ball has already been thrown
	and catched.

	This is the step when things starts to happen... Start as in
	step four, but when the second ball peaks, throw THE THIRD
	BALL! This is usually a little hard to do, but very soon you
	will get it. Just tell yourself that 'I WILL throw the ball
	this time!'

	Now, count 'one, two, three' instead of 'throw' and 'catch'.
	Count one time for each throw. Now learn this step and change
	the starting hand.


	6.

	As in step five, but when the THIRD ball peaks, throw the
	first ball back to its orignal hand. Count 'one, two, three,
	four'. You should now have two balls in your starting hand
	again.


	Now it's just a matter of getting it all together. Just keep
	throwing left, right, left, right and so on...

	@{b}You are now juggling!

	Beginner mistakes, tips etc :
	*****************************@{ub}

	The beginner will almost certainly walk forward while
	juggling. To straighten this out, stand in front af a wall.

	Try to throw the balls equally high.

	Always throw the balls @{b}under@{ub} the ball going down.

	Remember:

	* If you don't drop, you are probably not learning
	anything...

	* A touched ball is as good as if you had catched it because
	your hand knew where the ball was going...

	Practise, practise, practise!

	GOOD LUCK!


	@{"  " link tricks}  Some tricks to do
@endnode

@node tricks

	Some tricks to do:
	******************

	After learning a trick, try doing it while juggling, and then
	continue to juggle.

	@{"  " link trick1.ilbm/main} Throw above

	Instead of throwing one ball under the one falling down, throw
	it above. Called a 'reverse' throw.


	@{b}Throw under the arm@{ub}

	Just as you're going to throw, move your arm under the other
	and throw straight up. Then continue juggling. If you do this
	with the same ball all the time throwing with both right an
	left arm, you're juggling 'Tennis Upside-down', or something...

	
	@{"  " link trick2.ilbm/main} Rainbow cross

	Throw one ball high up in the middle. When that ball
	peaks, throw the other two so that they cross eachother. Catch
	the middle ball, and repeat. This is a 'columns' trick.


	@{"  " link trick3.ilbm/main} Two in one

	Learn to juggle two balls in one hand, in a circle, or paralell
	with eachother. There are three ways, 'columns', inside circles
	and outside circles. Look at the examples.


	@{"  " link trick4.ilbm/main} Columns

	Two balls in one hand goes up and down just like two
	elevators. Throw the third ball up and down in the other hand
	paralell to one of the other two balls. It's funniest when the
	two side balls are thrown in sync.


	@{"  " link trick5.ilbm/main} Jugglers' Tennis

	This trick looks very nice and you can start
	practising it after you have learned to throw 'reverse'
	throws.

	Take a ball that is different looking than the other two. Now,
	every time it's that balls turn, throw it *over* the other
	balls. This will make that ball going in it's own arc over
	the 'net' built up by the other two balls.


	@{b}'Fake' columns.@{ub}

	Juggle two in one hand. LIFT the
	left ball parallel with one of the other two balls.
	This looks quite funny.


	@{b}The 'Yo-Yo'.@{ub}

	Juggle two in one hand. Hold the third ball about
	15cm ABOVE one of the other two balls. This should look as if
	that ball hangs in a string under the third ball.


	@{b}Flashy three-ball-starts.@{ub}

	Hold all three balls in one hand in the
	shape of a triangle with the top of the triangle pointing
	forward. Throw all balls up in the air. Now one ball should
	go higher than the other two. Claw the other two balls and
	you are in the position of starting the usual three ball
	cascade.

	You can also point the top of the triangle towards yourself.
	Then, the lonely ball will go lower than the other two, so you
	can claw down on that one and than throw it straight up
	through the other two, grab them and start juggling.
	
	As you probably understand, the key to these two moves is to
	be quick. They are not difficult moves.

	Who am I?

	My name is Mathias Dahl.

	I was born in Uddevalla, Sweden in 1973, a warm sunny day in
	May. After that happened all kind of things, and this year
	(1995) in april, I started juggling (oh, of course I had to
	practise until I came that far...), and it feels like I'm
	going to do that for the rest of my life...

	If you have any questions, complaints or suggestins about this
	guide, @{b}contact me@{ub}. I'd like to have some feedback. Is it too
	complicated or is it easy to follow?

	I'll be very happy about tips or enhancements from other
	jugglers out there. Just send me a letter and I'll update the
	guide with your invaluable information.

	If anyone want to convert this guide to another format, just
	tell me about it and pleasy give me some credits, being the
	'original' author and all ;-)

	Of course, you'll have your name in the credits list. Isn't
	that nice?

@node more

	Tired of me?

	If you want to know more, you will have to buy a
	good book on juggling. Or if you have access to WWW
	you can go to JIS, Juggling Information System,
	@{b}http://www.hal.com/services/juggle/@{ub},
	which is a place where you can find almost anything
	about juggling things. Or you can look at
	rec.juggling, the usenet newsgroup.

	A very good book on ball juggling is @{b}Charlie
	Dancey's Encyclopædia of Ball Juggling,
	(ISBN 1 898591 13 X)@{ub}. This book have everything.
	It's funny, it has MANY tricks in it and it's easy to
	learn from (of course, difficult tricks are still difficult).
@endnode

@node gettingharder

	Well, well, here we are, pretending we have done everyone of
	the 'easy' tricks. Now follows a collection of a little bit
	harder tricks. These tricks need a lot of practise, but they
	are by no means impossible, no no, you can't possibly IMAGINE
	how difficult tricks there are out there... Moohaaa!!!

	Ok, here we go!

	@{"  " link shower}  Shower, the pattern all clowns and
	jugglers do in cartoons etc.

	@{"  " link barrage}  Burke's Barrage, a nice one.

	@{"  " link box}  The box, a 'square juggling' pattern.

	@{"  " link mess}  Mill's Mess, say no more...

	...to be continued...

@endnode

@node shower

	The shower is the pattern that's usually in cartoons etc.
	The balls seems to go in a circle around the jugglers body.
	You start by holding two balls in your right hand. Throw both
	balls in rapid succession towards the other hand. Throw
	the second ball before the first one peaks. Practise this
	until you build up good speed.
	
	Next take one ball in your left hand and two in left.
	Now do the same exercise as before but when you have thrown
	the second ball from the right and are just to catch ball
	number one, throw the left ball in a straight line to the
	right hand (called a 'feed').

	Now it's just a matter of getting more and more
	throws all the time. This is usually where everything messes
	up. I have no tips but to practise, practise, practise. It IS
	a rather difficult and fast pattern.

	Try it for a couple of minutes every time you practise
	juggling and it will eventually come to you.

	Also try to practise from left to right instead. You'll
	probably be very dissapointed when that hand is even worse...

	If you want, you can try the two-ball-shower to start with.
	Take one ball in each hand and throw with the right and feed
	with the left hand. Try both ways.

	Happy showering!

@endnode

@node barrage

	Ok, here's a nice one. Burke's Barrage is one of the three
	(are there more) pattern with cooool names ;-) The other two
	are Mill's Mess and Rubensteins Revenge. You will NOT find RR
	in this guide until I can juggle it myself...

	Why don't we start now? Ok!

	Ball numbers in order of appearance...

	Take one ball in each hand. Cross left arm over right.
	Now you are going to do two things at the same time (pretty
	tough...).

	Throw the ball in your right hand straight up...
	...at the same time, carry the other ball in an arc over
	the rising ball. Continue to circle your lefgt arm around the
	right until you end up as in the beginning but now instead
	the right arm is over the left.

	Practise this on both sides.

	Now it's time to add the third ball. Take two balls
	in your right and one ball in your left hand.
	
	Do the same move as above, but when you have carried the ball
	about 180 degrees from where you started, throw ball number
	three and then catch ball number one.

	By the time you have catched ball number one, your carrying
	arm should be where it started, but crossed under your right
	arm instead of over.

	Now throw ball number one to the right of the pattern.

	Practise theese moves and throws on both sides and then try to
	mix it all together.

	When you have the pattern working, two balls should go up and
	down in the middle of the pattern, while the third should be
	carried around the other two. If you have different coloured
	balls, you will notice that one ball is always the same in the
	middle, while the other two are beeing carried back and forth.

	If it helps it's nice to know that the first ball you throw
	it's the ball being carried next time, i.e the ball that you
	first throw with your right hand straight up will be cathed by
	the right hand again, and then, when your arms are crossed
	again, your right hand will carry the first thrown ball around
	just as the left hand did in the first 'cycle'.

	(The previous sentence is probably a liiiittle bit too
	long...)

	The ball you first throw from your right hand will land in the
	right hand again just as you throw the ball that was being
	carried by the left hand.

	I'll try to improve the explanation of this trick when I have
	a better one... You just have to cope with it. :)

	At least I understand what I'm talking about. ;-)

	Sorry, no pictures, it would take up too much space to include
	in this guide....

	...and I'm too lazy to draw them...

	My @{b}mother@{ub} for not going insane.

	@{b}Charlie Dancey@{ub} for his very nice book.

	@{b}You@{ub} for reading this.

@endnode

@node credits

	Come on, send me some tips!
	
@endnode

@node box

	@{b}The Box@{ub} is a funny looking pattern that belongs to the family
	of square juggling. In square juggling the balls dont go in
	circles, they go in straight lines.

	This pattern is a difficult one. I think it's harder than
	Mill's Mess and Burke's Barrage, but that's me...

	Ok, how does the pattern look like?
	Imagine three balls (hard eh?...), one of them is going up and
	down in the left hand, one is going up and down in the right
	hand but not at the same time. As the right ball goes up, the
	left ball is falling down. AT THE SAME TIME as theese balls
	pop up and down, the third ball pops between the hands.

	It looks like this:

        .       ^
        :       |
        |       O
        O       :
	v ---O> .

	How to you learn it then?

	Take one ball in each hand.

	Throw the left hand ball straight up, and AT THE SAME TIME,
	throw the right hand ball straight into the left hand. Before
	the left hand ball falls down again, you must throw back the
	ball you last threw.

	This is a very confusing move and *I* don't know any easy ways
	to learn it.

	Oh well... Practise this on both sides.

	When you want to do the hole pattern, take two balls in your
	right hand and one in the left.

	Start by throwing a ball from your right hand, just to start
	the pattern.

	Now, just do as you did in the previous exercise, throw the
	left ball up and at the same time throw the second right ball
	to the left. I think you understand now and hope you have more
	luck than me doing it.

@endnode

@node mess

	Two gentlemen sitting at a bar. (If you like Monthy Pyton,
	you'll know what I mean...)
	
	"Your wife, can she... juggle?"

	"Urrrmm, yes, a little... Why?"

	"What tricks can she do?"

	"Three ball cascade, the shower, Mill's Mess..."

	"MILL'S MESS! SAY NO MORE!, SAY NO MORE!!"

	Probably the most famous pattern, and nice looking too :)


	Ok, why don't we skip the bullshit and jump straight to the
	pattern...

	Put ONE ball in your right hand and cross your right arm OVER
	the left.

	Throw the ball to the RIGHT, uncross your hands, catch the
	ball with your LEFT hand ON IT'S WAY DOWN, somewhere between
	the peak and the bottom of it's path.
	Do it on both sides, staring with the left hand over the
	right.

	That wasn't THAT hard, was it? No? I didn't think so...

	Take one ball in each hand, right arm crossed over left. Throw
	the right hand ball as before, uncross, but before you catch
	the ball with your left, you will have to throw the left hand
	ball to the right.

	Got it? Practise this on both sides until it feels smooth and
	easy.

	On to three balls, one in your left, two in your right hand.
	Do the first two throws from the previous exercise, and before
	you catch the secont ball, throw your third ball straight up
	to the left (your right arm will be crossed UNDER your left.

	Practise on both sides.

	Ok, what do we got here? Almost Mill's Mess, you just have to
	weld it together and this is probably the hardest to describe,
	therefore I don't. :)

	Ok, you'll get a little help.

	If you look at the third ball you throw, the one going
	straight up, you'll see (if you manage to freeze the picture
	somehow :), that all looks just like when you have threwn the
	very first ball, and you now have to do the same things as you
	had to do if it had been so...

	A little clarification...

	If you started with the right hand, the ball we talked about
	(the one going straight up you know) is the same ball you
	would have threwn, had you started with the left hand.

	I can't describe it better in words. I'll try to draw some
	pictures to include in future versins of this guide, though I
	don't think it will help THAT much...

	
	Maybe I don't take this patten serious now that I can do it
	myself, but it really isn't that difficult to do (for a couple
	of throws). I have said it before and I'll say it again:
	PRACTISE, PRACTISE, PRACTISE...

	Just be sure to mess it up and it will work out allright...
