            Hallo , jetzt singen wir alle ein Lied.



                        CLEMENTINE

                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                    Eins , zwei , drei......

   In a cavern by a canyon

   excawaiting for a mine,

   dwerlt a miner fourty-niner

   and his douter Clementine.
 
 
CHOURS:

       Oh my darling,oh my darling

       oh my darling Clementine.

       Thouart lost and gone forever,

       dreadful sorry,Clementine.


   Light she was and like a fairy,

   and her schoes were number nine,

   hering boxes whithout topses,

   sandales were for Clementine


CHOURS:

       Oh my darling,oh my darling

       oh my darling Clementine.

       Thouart lost and gone forever,

       dreadful sorry,Clementine.


   Drove she ducklings to the water,

   every morning just at nine

   struck her foot against a splinter,

   fell into the foarming brine.


CHOURS:

       Oh my darling,oh my darling

       oh my darling Clementine.

       Thouart lost and gone forever,

       dreadful sorry,Clementine.


   Rosi lips above the water,

   blowing bubbles mighty fine,

   but alas I was no swimmer

   so I lost my Clementine.


CHOURS:

       Oh my darling,oh my darling

       oh my darling Clementine.

       Thouart lost and gone forever,

       dreadful sorry,Clementine.


   How I missed her!How I missed her!

   How I missed my Clementine!

   But I kissed her little sister,

   and for got my Clementine.

 
CHOURS:


       Oh my darling,oh my darling

       oh my darling Clementine.

       Thouart lost and gone forever,

       dreadful sorry,Clementine.



 Und noch mal von vorne......................
