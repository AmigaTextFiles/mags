xPK        - universal xpk packer
xUP        - universal xpk unpacker
xType      - types a compressed file to stdout
xDir       - shows which files in a directory or if a file is compressed
xQuery     - shows a list of packers and their properties
xLoadSeg   - patches LoadSeg() to automatically decompress files loaded


xpk
---
Usage: xpk [-s][-p password] method files
       method [-s][-p password] files

You pass this program a list of file names. They will be compressed,
their originals will be removed and the compressed file will be stored
under the same name. Using the -s (suffix) switch, you can force xpk
to leave the uncompressed version and append .xpk to the compressed one.
After -p, the next argument will be the password to be used for encoding.
You may also rename it to any method, then it will always use its own
name as packing algorithm.


xup
---
Usage: xup [-p password] files

Will unpack files packed using XPK, and stored it under the same name.
Using -p you can pass passwords. Uncompressed files in the list will
be skipped. If the file has a .xpk suffix, the decompressed file 
will be stored under the truncated name and the original compressed
file will remain intact.


xType
-----
Usage: xType files

Will print these files to stdout.


xDir
----
Usage: xDir
       xDir files
       xDir dirs

The first form will display information about all files in the current
directory (if they're compressed etc.). The second form will display info
only about the given files. The third only about the files in the given
dirs.


xQuery
------
Usage: xQuery
       xQuery packer

The first form will display information about all available packers and
their modes. The second form will display information only about a 
specific packer.


xLoadSeg
--------
Usage: xLoadSeg
       xLoadSeg -q

The first form installs a patch that permits direct loading of XPK-packed
executables. The second form will remove the patch.
