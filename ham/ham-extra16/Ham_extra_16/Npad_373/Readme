NumPad 37.3 - Small non-commodity version

Emulates a numeric keypad on some Amiga keys when CAPSLOCK is on.

For smaller memory usage, Numpad is not a commodity.  To start it,
double-click, or run >NIL:.  Or you can place Numpad in the 2.0 boot
disk or boot partition WbStartup drawer to start it automatically whenever
the Amiga is booted from that disk or partition and Workbench is loaded.

To remove it, run it again, or double-click it.

Emulates the numeric pad if the CAPSLOCK is on.

While the CAPSLOCK is down, the following key positions (shown on left
as marked on US keyboard) will emulate the keypad:

CAPSLOCK + This	        Emulates This

i o p [			7 8 9 -
k l ; '			4 5 6 +
