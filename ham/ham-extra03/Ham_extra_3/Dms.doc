    BUGS&UPDATE REPORT is included seperately in the UPDATE.DOC ...




                           Chapter 1.
                           ----------

FOR BBS OWNERS ... Only for users of /X 2.x/3.x or clones

Included with this archive you can find a new DMS checker utility
 made to support the new standards, Highdensity files, etc...
 (REWRITTEN LAYOUT ,MORE INFORMATIVE, AND FASTER!!!! V1.32)

IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU USE THE "DMSTEST" PROGRAM, AS
 THE WELLKNOWN "MAPUS" DESTROYS THE HEADERINFO(PARTLY), AND
 WILL IN NEAR FUTURE RESULT IN DMS SHOWING INCORRECT INFORMATION
 AND COULD UNPACK YOUR FILE INCORRECTLY.
 OR THE DEVELOPER OF "Mapus" COULD MAKE AN UPDATE, WHICH FOLLOWS
 THE RESTRICTIONS TOLD/SHOWN IN THE "DEVELOPER" SECTION.

                           ----------

NEWS IN DMS .
-------------

Following is an explanation of new features since dms v2.x.



3.1.                       DMSDEVICE
                           ---------

The device driver which can be found in the DEVS: directory on this
 disk is for the mounting of a virtual drive. But not as you normally
 would expect. Unlike FFx: FMx: , DMS-DEVICE is for mounting DMS files,
 and accessing files included in the archive without having to extract it.
 So the main difference between FMx/FFx and our DMx: device, is that
 FMS.device and FFx.device takes up 901120 bytes pr. disk, And DMS.device
 only uses the same space which your DMS file does.



3.2.                        SFXDMS
                            ------

SFXDMS is a part of DMS, which gives you the option of creating
 executable DMS files, which can be extracted without the need of
 the DMS program.
The executable file will only occupy memory for the main program.
 Data will be loaded in one track at a time, and depacked.
 The new option in DMS for this, is  SFX.
 Read more about this later in this documentation.

ADVANTAGE:
*SIMPLE PATCH FILES WHICH WILL UNPACK WITHOUT NEED OF DMS.




3.3.                        UNdms
                            -----


UNdms can only unpack DMS files.
 The main reason for making this tool is for those who need to
 include DMS archives on their disk.

But because of the minimizing of the filesize, boottracks will not
 be tested for viruses nor shown.
UNdms works with all the supplied options as in the FULL DMS.
 but unlike DMS, UNdms will not use verification of data written to
 disk as default. you must use the "VERIFY" option for verification.

ADVANTAGES:
*MORE SPACE ON THE DISKS WHERE DMS, IS A PART OF THE TOOLS
  WHICH IS NEEDED TO EXTRACT PATCHES ETC.

*SIMPLY MORE SPACE ON YOUR MODEM-DISK, IF YOU ARE A DISK USER



3.4.                       DMSWB
                           -----

DMSWB is a Workbench based version of DMS. It works just like
 DMS but is iconbased.

DMSWB has more advantages, such as being multitasking,
 so you can write a DMS file, while you're viewing the information
 about it, or you can compress a disk using another drive.
 Because DMSWB can do 4 commands at a time, you have 4 information
 outputs on the right side of the DMSWB window.

DMSWB has been tested on, Kickstart 1.3 / 2.x / 3.x .
 You can use either reqtools.library or asl.library, for
 filerequests.
Included on the disk are both asl.library and reqtools.library,
 just rename the needed reqtoolsXX.library for use on your
 kickstart version, to reqtools.library.

Note, DMSWB is limited in speed and some operations, so
 register and get a full version.
 Read the REGISTER.ME file for more information.




3.5.              File-Masher System (FMS)
                  ------------------------


FMS is a part of DMS, which allows the user to pack files
and include those files to the DMS file.

DMS and FMS, a 2-in-one file packing utility.
 FMS is file compressor for data and/or executable not unlike files.
 DMS shows that it can compete with LhA in file packing, and combining
 both diskimages and files in one single archive, this makes it even
 more powerful.

FMS will detect DMS images(tracks) and tell you if found,
 and vice versa when unpacking tracks.

When packing whole directories, FMS is very simple to use for this.
 Specify directory for packing, and the directory + subdirectories
 will be packed without having to do anything, but specifying the
 directory.








                           Chapter 4.
                           ----------

DMS COMMANDS
------------

The following subchapters explain the commands in dms, each command explained,
 will be shown with an example.  All options which work with the command
 is explained closer in chapter 5 .
Commands that operates with a device, work default on device DF0:,
 using the options FROM / TO can redirect reading or writing from
 another device.




4.1.                          READ
                              ----


This command will read and compress a disk.

The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS Read file[.DMS] [FROM Dev:] [PC] [HD] [TEXT filetext] [DIZTEXT filetext]
               [CMODE mode] [LOW lowtrack] [HIGH hightrack] [ENCRYPT password]
               [NOVAL] [NOZERO] [RETRY value] [DEVFIX]

Where

  file[.DMS]

  - is the output file which will contain the archived disk.
    The output file can be either a previously written FMS file,
    or you can append tracks to an existing DMS archive.



 READ EXAMPLES
 -------------

  DMS READ myfile

  - compress a disk inserted in DF0: and save the data as MYFILE.dms.


  DMS READ myfile FROM df1: TEXT mytext LOW 0 HIGH 79

  - compress a disk inserted in DF1: and save the compressed data
     as MYFILE.dms, include a text called MYTEXT and
     read tracks 0 to 79.


  DMS READ myfile FROM PC1: PC HD LOW 0 HIGH 79 CMODE NONE

  - compress a PC disk inserted in PC1: and save the data as MYFILE.dms,
     read tracks 0 to 79, and do not compress the data.






4.2.                         WRITE
                             -----


This command will write an archive to a device.

The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS Write file[.DMS],,, [PC] [HD] [TO Dev:] [LOW lowtrack] [HIGH hightrack]
                [DECRYPT password] [NOVAL] [NOVERIFY] [NOTEXT] [NOPAUSE]
                [RETRY value]

  Where

  - file[.DMS] can be an DMS archive.
    Multiply files can be written at one time.



 WRITE EXAMPLES
 --------------

  DMS WRITE myfile

  - decompress myfile.dms to a disk in DF0:


  DMS WRITE myfile TO df1: NOVERIFY NOTEXT

  - decompress myfile.dms to a disk in DF1: , do not verify the
     datas written, ignore text files added to this archive and
     leave out printing of the boottrack.


  DMS WRITE myfile TO pc1: PC DECRYPT ParCon_Software

  - decompress myfile.dms to a disk in PC1: , write data in
     PC disk format, and decrypt the archive with the
     password Parcon_Software.




4.3.                         REPACK
                             ------


This command will repack a previously compressed archive.


The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS Repack file[.DMS] [TO file] [LOW lowtrack] [HIGH hightrack]
                 [CMODE mode] [NOTEXT]


 REPACK EXAMPLES
 ---------------


  DMS REPACK stuff LOW 20 HIGH 40 CMODE none

  - Will extract tracks 20 through 40 from the archive stuff.DMS ,
    recompress them using no compression and store the  results
    in the file TEMP.DMS .


  DMS REPACK old TO new

  - Will recompress the archive old.DMS using the default compression mode
    and store the results in the file new.DMS



4.4.                          VIEW
                              ----


View information in archive. You can view information about the archive
 and the computer it was compressed on.

The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS View file[.DMS] [FULL]



EXAMPLE OUTPUT OF A DMS FILE
----------------------------

File: myfile.DMS  Size: 823928  Created: Thu Apr 07 10:33:03 1994
Lowtrack in Archive: 00  Hightrack in Archive: 79
Packed Bytes: 802486  UnPacked Bytes: 901120
Kickstart Version used : 39.106   AGA
Machine Used: AMIGA
Machine CPU: 68020
CPU Coprocessor: 68881
Time to Create Archive: 1 mins. 1 secs.
Version Number of Creator: 2.03
Version Needed to Extract: 1.11
Disktype of Archive: AMIGA OS 1.0 OFS
Compression Mode Used: HEAVY2
General Info: NOZERO
Info Header CRC: 3A65


When the option FULL is added, dms will after the information header
show you the compression rates on tracks in the archive.


Track  Plength  Ulength  Cmode   USUM  HCRC  DCRC Cflag
-----  -------  -------  ------  ----  ----  ---- -----
  0     11264    11264   NOCOMP  026A  58CF  42A7    0




4.5.                          TEST
                              ----


Test integrity of archive. DMS makes a basic CRC check of the archive.
 DMS will not report errors which is case of bad compression.

The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS Test file[.DMS]



4.6.                          TEXT
                              ----


Show the text header which is added to a archive.
DMS will show the first text information added to the archive.

The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS Text file[.DMS]


4.7.                         VIEWDIZ
                             -------


This command will read a archive and search for a file_id.diz textfile which
maybe have been added and show the file_id.diz found.


The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS viewdiz file[.DMS] [SAVE filename]

  - If the SAVE option have been added, you can choose a filename
     for the file_id.diz found in the archive, and it will be saved
     for future use.


4.8.                          SFX
                              ---

This command will change a dms archive to be self-extracting.
meaning, the dms archive can be executed and will unpack itself
to a device specified after the .SFX name, or Device DF0: is none
specified.  The self-extracting dms file works just like when
writing with the WRITE command.  All option are selectable after
the .SFX filename.

The DMS filesize will only be 17K larger, when the executable
hunk is added to the .DMS file, which is not much.
so if you need the .DMS file and the DMS program together on
one disk, you can simply make the DMS file executable and
put it on the disk.
The SFX file may look like it needs a lot of memory to be
executed, but it will only allocate around 150K.
The DMS DATA, will be loaded into memory when needed.
So don't let yourself get scared when you have an executable
file of 850K.


The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS sfx file[.DMS]

  - destination file will be named file.SFX .




4.9.                         PREFS
                             -----


Preferences window will be called when you use this option.
In the prefs menu you will be able to select several options for
use with DMS.
The first time you start DMS, you will be shown the preferences menu
and then you can select the options you want to use with DMS.
This window will not be shown again, unless you call it.


The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS Prefs

  - You can exit the prefs window by clicking the closewindow icon.





                           Chapter 5.
                           ----------

DMS OPTIONS
-----------

All options explained here, are meant to be written after the
command identifier.



5.1. FROM Dev:
--------------

Will read the disk from a different device.  The default device is DF0:
 (internal drive).
 Reading of HIGH-DENSITY DISKS needs the HD option added after the command.
 Reading of PC DOS DISKS need the PC option added after the command.

 You may choose any device when the following specifications match.

    ADOS DISK:
              80 tracks,
              2 sides,
              11 sectors/track,
              512 bytes per sector.

    [Usually DF0:, DF1:, DF2:, DF3:, RAD:, FM0:, FF0:, etc.]


    ADOS HIGH-DENSITY DISK:
              80 tracks,
              2 sides,
              22 sectors/track,
              512 bytes per sector.

    [Usually DF0:, DF1:, DF2:, DF3: ]


    Cross-Dos mounted devices.

    PC DOS DISK:
              80 tracks,
              2 sides,
              9 sectors/track,
              512 bytes per sector.

    [Usually PC0:, PC1:, PC2:, PC3: ]

    PC DOS HIGH-DENSITY DISK:
              80 tracks,
              2 sides,
              18 sectors/track,
              512 bytes per sector.

    [Usually PC0:, PC1:, PC2:, PC3: ]


5.2. TO Dev:
------------

Will write the output to device Dev: (the default is drive DF0:)
 The device must follow the same rules as in the READ command.



5.3. TEXT filetext
------------------

Causes DMS to read in the file 'filetext' and add it to the archive.
 When the archive is extracted the text will be displayed before writing
 the disk.  This is useful for identifying disks or giving other
 information about the archive.  



5.4. DIZTEXT myfileid
---------------------

Will add 'myfileid' to the dms image as a FILE_ID.DIZ.



5.5. CMODE mode
---------------

Chooses the compression mode used.  Mode is either NONE, HEAVY1, HEAVY2
 or BEST

 The default mode is BEST

 Available modes are:

  NONE   - No Compression is performed (Straight Read).
  HEAVY1 - Heavy compression, good speed/compression ratio.
  HEAVY2 - Best available compression.  Only available with >1meg ram.
  BEST   - Chooses Best compression method for available memory.



5.6. LOW lowtrack
-----------------

Specifies the starting track to read from.  The default is track 0.
 Lowtrack must be a value from 0 to 79.



5.7. HIGH hightrack
-------------------

Specifies the ending track to stop at.  The default is track 79.
 Hightrack must be a value from 0 to 79.



5.8. NOVAL
----------

Stops DMS from inhibiting the disk validator when reading the disk.



5.9. NOZERO
-----------

Normally DMS will read the AmigaDOS bitmap from the disk and archive
 only sectors which are being used.  If the disk is a non-filing system
 disk or has a bad bitmap, DMS will automatically archive the whole disk.
 In EXTREME cases DMS will make a wrong assumption about the type of
 disk it is archiving. NOZERO will cause DMS to archive the whole disk
 totally ignoring the disk bitmap.  Generally you will rarely if ever
 have to use this option.



5.10. ENCRYPT password
----------------------

Causes DMS to encrypt the input from the disk using the password supplied.
 'password' is any alphanumeric word you desire.
 Examples: Joe, Fred, ABC1234, ONLY-FOR-ME, etc.



5.11. DECRYPT password
----------------------

Causes DMS to decrypt the archive with the password 'password'.  This
 is only used if the archive was previously encrypted.  'password' must
 be the EXACT same one used when encrypting the file otherwise the archive
 will not be processed correctly.



5.12. NOTEXT
------------

Causes DMS to ignore any text to be displayed from the archive.
Displaying of boottracks will also be ingored.



5.13. NOPAUSE
-------------

Stops DMS from pausing after displaying any text from the archive.



5.14. PC
--------

Will threat disk in the specified device, as a PC DOS disk.



5.15. HD
--------

Will read disk in the specified device as a HIGH-DENSITY disk.
 This option works for both Amiga and PC disks.



5.16. DEVFIX
------------

Will read the disk in the device specified, and save datas
in a way which makes the DMS.DEVICE read datas much faster.



5.17. RETRY value
-----------------

DMS default retry to read datas from a device only once.
and when writing with verify, it will retry 3 times.
You can select different number of retries.
Value must be within the range of 0 to 65535 .

                           ----------

FMS COMMANDS
------------

6.1.                        MAKESFX
                            -------

Makes a FMS archive self-extracting, meaning that DMS is not needed
for extracting the files in the FMS archive.

The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS MAKESFX archive[.FMS]




6.2.                        A (Add)
                            -------

Compress file and store into archive. With this option you can
store files into an archive or you can store files to a previous DMS file.
NOTE: to add files to an existing DMS file, add the .DMS extension to
the filename.


The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS A archive[.FMS][.DMS] filename filename,,,,





6.3.                      E (extract)
                          -----------

Extract files from archive. 
You can select a destination for the files.
When extracting, dms will search both for DMS and FMS files.


The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS E archive[.FMS][.DMS] [DESTINATION PATH]



6.4.                       V (View)
                           --------

View files in archive.

Displaying contents of a compressed archive will show most important
 information on the contents and full directory structure.


The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS V archive[.FMS][.DMS]




6.5.                       L (List)
                           --------

List files in archive.

Displaying contents of a compressed archive will show most important
 information on the contents and filename without paths.


The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS L archive[.FMS][.DMS]



6.6.                         TEST
                             ----

Testing integrity of a FMS file. Add the extension(.FMS) to the archive name.


The basic usage for this command is:

  DMS TEST archive.FMS

General Information
-------------------

The story.

DMS was originally written by SDS software and first release
 was made in 1991. Shortly after the release of DMS, WARP was
 quickly replaced by DMS, because of its advantage in compression
 and speed. Since DMS version v1.11, users have not seen any updates
 from SDS software. Registered users which got their v1.11 never got
 anything else.
 From different sources, We were told, that SDS software never
 replied to bug reports nor updates. We find that SDS software
 was ignoring all mail because the programmer didn't want to continue
 his work, or simply started working on another platform.
 We at ParCon software saw our chance to make DMS more powerful and 
 make the nessesary changes which were needed to keep up with the
 operating systems made for Amiga, and try to pleeze those people
 who tried to notify SDS about problems with dms.

In 1993, DMS v1.51 was released through a source which was quite
 famous and working in group which was known for releasing powerful
 products. This early release version was made to test users ability
 to change from using the old dms v1.11 and upgrade to the new v1.51 .
 Soon after followed the v1.53 still released through this source.
 DMS got well received by the users all over the world, and We decided
 to follow up on the development of dms, and created the company
 "ParCon software" . We rewrote most routines in DMS, except for
 the compression algorithms which is very complex and efficient, and
 made dms perform better on disks which were unrecognized since the release
 of Kickstart 2.x. Several changes in DMS have made it possible for the user
 to compress different kinds of devices, such as highdensity and pc disks.

Registered users of the old dms v1.11, will once again have to register to
 get their updated version. As DMS v1.11 and DMS v2.x got only one thing in
 common, that is the compability of compressing and decompressing of
 DMS images. We have not ripped dms from the authors, they gave up in 1991.
 The Device-Masher System is made very similar to the old dms v1.11 because
 users have a hard time changing from one program to another, if the old one
 still works fine. And those who wished to use the new version had no
 problems installing their dms v2.x in their regular scripts, etc.
 The register fee you must pay is because we feel, that all the work and
 effort we have put in development of this updated/rewritten dms have
 taken us a lot of time. Commercial products are often much more
 expensive. So we urge you to register your dms, so we can continue
 the work, with our registered users in mind, so We feel that all our
 work hasn't been for nothing .
