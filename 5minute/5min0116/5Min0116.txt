"The interactive information market is exploding. With the number of retail
kiosk applications expanding rapidly, we anticipate sizeable growth. We
especially feel confident that our custom developed, professional systems
with full service networks far exceed the present industry standards in
content, operational and multimedia capabilities. Plus, these custom packaged
systems are complete turnkey kiosks from just one source AND are one of the
best price/performance systems in the industry," commented H. Douglas Peter,
president, St. Clair Interactive Communications.

"We are also pleased to announce that we have chosen the Commodore Amiga as
the exceptional multimedia computer component. The Amiga's quality digital
audio, digital video and multitasking capabilities tremendously enhance each
system's delivery performance. We know this from experience since St. Clair

that incorporate the Amiga. Some of these prestigious installations include
The Logan Airport, Massachusetts; K Mart Coupon Centers; and The National
Auto League in Ontario, Canada," added Doug Peter.

            Freedom Floptical Drives for Amiga -- Available Now!
 ______     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(__  __)              Bellevue, WA -- January 1993
  / /
 / /
(_/he Freedom Floptical Drive from Purple Mountain Computers has quickly
become a standard on other computer platforms because of its versatility and
low price. Floptical disks and drives are more portable than Removable Hard
Drives and they allow compatibility with 1.44 MB disks. PMC is proud to take
part in the advancement of technology in the Amiga field, as well as serving
the Amiga community!

Here's what you get when you buy a Freedom Floptical Drive:

    Versatility     Read/write 720K/1.44 MB/21 MB 3.5" disks.

    Compactness     Small footprint (4.7 x 7.8 x 2 inches).

    Expandability   5 (FIVE!) Floptical disks included = 100 MB of storage.
                    Buy more disks to expand as needed.

    Portability     21 MB disks are standard 3.5" disk size, just slip 'em
                    in your pocket and you're off!

    Quality         Hundreds of people now have Freedom Drives and their
                    testimonies are positive:

                        "I've been using the Freedom Floptical drives for
                        many months now and have never had a problem since
                        connecting it to my system. With the prices of
                        Floptical disks dropping in price, the floptical
                        has become a very economical alternative in storage.
                        I have recommended your company to many people that
                        I know, with the secure feeling that they will
                        receive the same outstanding service and product
                        that I have."

                                                - Dennis H. Yogi


    Low Price       Price is one of the most important aspects, and with
                    the Freedom Floptical Drive you get the lowest price
                    guaranteed (we'll meet or beat any legitimate
                    advertised price for the same components).  The
                    Freedom Drive is JUST $399 for internal model or $419
                    for an external model!

What Do Ya Get?     Freedom Floptical Drive
For $399            5 (FIVE!) Floptical Disks

For $419            Case (in addition to the above items)
                    Power Supply

All you need is a SCSI Host Adapter (most such as GVP, ICD, etc. support
Floptical drives, just call your respective manufacturer for details). Just
plug the drive into the adapter, and step into the future of disk technology!

personal computer. Professional Page 4.0 is fuly compatible with Commodore's
new AGA Chipset and includes free-of-charge a hot-linked paint program for
fast changes to graphics as part of the company's aggressive $75.00 USD,
$85.00 CDN upgrade program for current users of Professional Page 3.0.

"Gold Disk is acutely aware of the changing needs of Amiga desktop
publishers, and our announcement of Professional Page 4.0 demonstrates the
company's commitment to provide users with state-of-the-art desktop
publishing tools," said Kailash Ambwani, CEO and president of Gold Disk Inc.

New features included in Professional Page 4.0:

- Support for the new Commodore AGA chipset
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This new chipset is found on the Amiga 4000 and 1200. Bitmapped images can
now be displayed on-screen using up to 256 colors giving users the benefit of
true WYSIWYG viewing and more exact on-screen proofing.

- A hot-linked graphics editor
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The graphics editor is a full featured paint program. The paint program is
used for the creation of bitmapped images or editing existing images and
allows for automatic export from Professional Page 4.0 for quick and easy
editing. A hot-linked text editor has been a standard part of Professional
Page since version 2.0.

- Enhanced graphic handling with new graphics import filters
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Users can now import graphics generated in IBM PC and Macintosh GIF, TIF,
PCX, BMP and EPS file formats. On screen TIFF preview is included. In
addition, Adobe Illustrator and Aldus Freehand EPSF files can be imported and
edited using Professional Draw 3.0. Professional Page 4.0 includes a hot-link
to Professional Draw 3.0 making it posible to export structured drawings to
Professional draw, edit the drawing and return it to Professional Page 4.0
for inclusion in a document.

- Additional text handling features
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These new features include enhanced text styles such as drop shadow effect
and pattern filled text; a built-in visual Pair Kerning editor to adjust the
kerning of any font to pre-defined specifications; a font preview window that
aids in the selection of typefaces, and a new text import filter for
AmiWrite, WordsWorth and Kindwords 3. Professional Page 4.0 supports 15 DOS
and Amiga wordprocessor text imput filters.

- User-definable display modes

and utilize the zoom-in capabilities from 10 percent to 400 percent (in 1
percent increments).

Other new features includes the visual Page Sorter that allows users the
capability to arrange pages within a document and a "stick-on" note feature
that enables users to add non-printed messages or instructions to a document.

Professional Page 4.0 also includes a selection of new time saving Genies.
Genies are automated macros that aid in the creation of documents and in the
execution of difficult or tedious tasks. Introduced in Professional Page 3.0,
Genies automate such functions as envelope addressing, automatic mail merges
from external databases and automatic grid and table creation.

"The addition of these new features makes Professional Page 4.0 the desktop
publishing tool of choice for Amiga users," said Mike Iampietro, sales and
marketing manager for Gold Disk's Amiga products. "Professional Page is easy
to use from start to finish and is generally recognized as the product with
the highest quality output for the Amiga. We are committed to delivering

                      Get on the Railroad to Riches!
                Maxis Releases A-Train for Amiga Computers
    _  _        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \/ \              Orinda, CA -- Janurary 1993
  /      \
 / /\  /\ \
(_/  \/  \_)axis has released the Amiga version of its best-selling
simulation game, A-Train(TM), for $69.95. The DOS version of the game has
been on top-ten lists since its release in May 1992.

A-Train, the latest Software Toy from Maxis, challenges you to build the
metropolis of your dreams, with a railroad as the transportation hub, and
prove that a prosperous city can develop around a clean and efficient public
transit system.

Each of A-Train's six scenarios start you off with building materials, cash,
and a playing field in various stages of urban development. Then you buy land,
lay track anyplace for 19 different freight and passenger trains, and
schedule their runs. The trains will transport people and building materials
to areas under development, laying the groundwork for the housing, jobs and
recreational centers that your city needs to grow.

Your trains zip around in a landscape that includes trees, farmland, hills,
houses, even cows. The simulation cycles through day and night, and through
the seasons of the year for a heightened sense of realism.

As your city grows, you build wealth by speculating in real estate or
dabbling in the stock market. Advisors will pop onto your screen with
business and construction advice, which you can act on or ignore, as you
choose.

With your newfound wealth, you develop office buildings, hotels, apartments,
factories, amusement parks, ski resorts, malls, stadiums, and golf courses.
On-screen balance sheets of revenues vs. expenses help you track which
investments are winners, and which are money pits.

You'll need a sharp eye for good business opportunities, and the guts to act
on your instincts quickly. Otherwise, competing entrepreneurs may buy prime
land out from under your nose for their own development projects.

If you succeed in developing a large city, you will be rewarded with a Bullet
Train for high-speed transport. If you go broke... well, you can always start
over and try again.

In a sense, A-Train is the capitalist's SimCity -- the private sector
approach to urban development. It combines city-building with railroad
management and sophisticated financial modeling to provide a depth of play
that will keep you challenged for weeks, months, and even years. Later this
month, Maxis will release the A-Train Construction Set for the Amiga, which
allows players to create custom playing fields for greater flexibility,
experimentation, and challenge.

The A-Train Construction Set lets you create your own custom playing field,
expanding on A-Train's six scenarios. With the Construction Set, you can:

  o  Change saved games and scenarios, or build a landscape from scratch.
  o  Sculpt your playing field with mountains, forests, and lakes.
  o  Add trains, tracks, land, and business subsidiaries -- for free!
  o  Donate nearly a billion dollars to your favorite charity -- you!
  o  Set up a simple city or challenge yourself to manage an urban disaster.

A-Train is the U.S. version of a game originally published in Japan in 1990
by Artdink(R), based on a series of games that began in 1986. A-Train has
sold over 100,000 copies, won major awards, and has consistently ranked #1 in
Japanese consumer polls.

Maxis, based in Orinda, CA, and founded in 1987, publishes Software Toys(R),
which let players learn through exploration, with no traditional way to win
or lose. Maxis' first game, SimCity(R), was published in 1989 and has been a
consistent top seller ever since. SimCity was joined on the best-seller list
by SimEarth(R) in 1990, SimAnt(R) in 1991, and A-Train in 1992. Other
software titles include RoboSport(TM) and the recently-released SimLife(TM).
Maxis is among the fastest-growning software companies today.
