This month (so far), we have received over 12,000 phone calls/orders for our
multitude of new and refurbished items we scrounged from the dusty shelves of
Commodore!  Let's face facts here...12,000 calls is a LOT of calls.

With that many calls coming in, there WILL be some orders that take a lot
longer to get out the door.  All we ask is that folks have a wee bit more
patience than normal when ordering from the thousands of items we have found
still available at Commodore.  You wouldn't believe some of the cool items we
located...some we thought were extinct!

At any rate...if you need information about one of the many new items we have
in stock, please give us a call at 800-292-7445 or 914-357-2424.  Help us to
help you, meaning, if the line is busy, please try again.  There are so many
folks calling, it's a J-O-B to keep things running efficiently...but we are
trying are best.

Thanx a Zillion

                 Important Updates and Upgrades in the Files

                   *StarShip* News Network -- Oct 29, 1993

The Newest AmigaGuide has been released from Commodore.  It is a
bug-squashing release, and includes new distribution and free licensing
information for developers.                              GEnie File# 21302

Golden Gate's free software upgrade from vortex was uploaded to the GEnie
software libraries.  For those of you with this killer emulation package,
don't overlook Files # 21298 and 21297.

Robin Evans has updated his ARexx Guide file.  You can get the WHOLE thing
again, or just download the patch. This is a great reference, and, by the
way, what he is using to teach ARexx Classes on GEnie with.    Patch  #21271
                                                            Complete   21270

The newest Aladdin script for SysMom's NetSearch column in LiveWire is now

              Interactive Multimedia LiveWire Magazine for the Amiga
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ____             *StarShip* News Network -- Oct 29, 1993
  (_  _)
   / /
 _/ / t's here, it's live, and the entire *StarShip* is darn proud of it.
(____)It's the Multimedia issue of LiveWire, GEnie's monthly magazine.  Like
any really cool project, we received word at the last minute that it was a
'go' for the November issue, and rather than wait a month, our intrepid
LiveWire Editor, Peggy Herrington, wanted to just go for it.

Of course, Peggy and I knew that the Amiga could do it in the short time
frame.  But wow, was it a lot of work.

The issue is a free download so that everyone can enjoy reading and looking
at the animations in it. Get it while it's still hot, from GEnie's page 20,
the FREE download area of LiveWire magazine.  It was created with CanDo, from
INOVAtronics, and lots of blood, sweat and tears.  But you don't have to have
CanDo to make it work.

The first thing you'll notice after you download it and run it is an opening
screen which stays only briefly, then you go to the contents page, which has
all the article titles and by each one small presents or Christmas balls.
Both the words and the graphics of the contents page will let you navigate
through the magazine.

But don't move too fast, Look at that beautiful flickering candle, and
notice the subtle stamping of the snowflake design in the background.  These
are just a few of the really nice graphic touches which Zak Jarvis added to
Bruce Robison's theme graphics for the issue as we tried to get this pulled
together.

When I couldn't line up the buttons right, Zak could, and when I couldn't
figure out how in the world to make the palettes match, Zak was right there
making them smoothly work just the way we needed them to.

I was amazed at what we could do in about a week's worth of work, 16 colors,
and an Amiga.  We'd all love to hear how you enjoy it, and if you'd like to
see more of these kinds of productions. You can talk about it in Category 7
of the *StarShip* bulletin Board, in topic 8.  And don't miss the
opportunity to find out all the funny stories about the making of this
production in the special conference which we'll have in a week or so
online.  Watch the *StarShip* announcements for a time, then come and meet
all the people who made this happen.  Find out why some of the graphics were
chosen for some of the articles, and learn ALL about how that Christmas
Lemming escaped from the Software Library file # 13353!


Eye Candy Does Not Come Easy

Don't expect one every week, my family was already beginning to wonder if I
still existed in the real world before this was finished.  Pretty things
take time. And Murphy had his say in this, too, just as I was about to add
the music to the final version, my Amiga 3000 started going flakey on me.
It seems I've got some chip ram that's gone south.  We were lucky that we
even got the final version compiled into a run time file - and it doesn't
have any music.

I'll upload the music file we were going to use, it's a peppy MOD file of
Jingle Bells, since the theme for the issue was Christmas. You can use your
favorite mod player in the background and just pretend that I got it added,
OK?

Lest you think that the magazine is all flash and no meat, think again,
there are some fine articles of interest to GEnie members inside.  All we
did was give those well written words a pretty picture frame.

For anyone without the needed 2 megs of ram to run it in, the *StarShip*
staff will CONSIDER doing a second version and uploading it to the Amiga
Library which is optimized for low ram and runs from disk instead of out of
memory.  You may leave a message requesting this in Mail to the Sysops or
on the bulletin board.  If there are enough requests, we'll get to work on
it.

Right now, though, I'd just like the weekend off...

                  AugmenTek Announces the Release of RexxVar
    _             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \                  SeaTac, WA -- October 24, 1993
  / - \
 / ___ \
(_/   \_)ugmenTek unveils RexxVar, a simple but powerful way of exchanging
data between ARexx variables and any program that uses input and output
files.  The output  from a command or program (including a meaningful error
code) can be placed in either one ARexx variable or in a stem array, while
the input to a command or program can be read from either an ARexx variable
or stem array.

For example, to sort the values in a stem array called "lines." (whose
indices ranges from 1 to n, and n is in "lines.0"),  one would type:

Address REXXVAR 'Sort from REXXVAR:lines. to REXXVAR:sorted_lines.'

The "sorted_lines." stem array would be created with an increasing integer
index, starting at 1.  The total number of "sorted_lines." values is placed
in "sorted_lines.0".  One can also sort words in a variable in a similar
fashion.

Substrings in a variable as well as stem array values can be delimited by any
character (or none) on input or output.

Support is also included for arbitrary (i.e., not necessarily numeric or
increasing in order) stem index values.  For example:

     indices = 'TED BILL'
     fullname.BILL = 'William'
     fullname.TED = 'Theodore'
     fullname.BOB = 'Robert'
     Address REXXVAR "Type from REXXVAR:fullname./nl/indices"

will output only the values relating to the desired indices:

     Theodore
     William

In combination with AmigaDOS commands and programs, this facility can
provide  a familiar and quick-coding means of importing and exporting
file data (COPY command), passing data among AREXX programs (COPY
command with PIPE:), listing of stem variable values (TYPE command),
creation of stem arrays from variable values and vice versa (COPY
command), extraction of environment variable values (GETENV command),
editing of a variable's or stem array's values (your favorite
editor), and more.

  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

RexxVar requires AmigaDOS/Kickstart(TM) 2.04 or higher, and the suggested
retail price is $25.00 (US.)  Please allow $3.00 for shipping and handling.

(_/   \_)xiom Software announces Anim Workshop version 2.  Anim Workshop is
a program for the Amiga and Video Toaster that allows the user to create,
edit, process and add sounds to an Amiga animation.  Anim Workshop version 2
now supports AGA screen modes and Anim5, Anim7 and Anim8 animations.  Also
new to version 2 is a new interface with improved file list features, full
DCTV support, and more ARexx functions.  Batch process a list of images
using ADPro or Image F/X operators to create processed animations.  Anim
Workshop provides a powerful set of tools that can be used to create an
animation from a list of images or seperate an animation into IFF files,
insert or delete frames, convert colors, flip, scale, or perform any other
image operation on the entire animation.  A full-featured anim player allows
the user to step through, tag frames for processing, change frame timing,
and play the animation with sound.

Anim Workshop version 2 Requires:

   - ADPro or Image F/X required for some image processing features
   - Workbench version 2.0 or higher

An Upgrade is available from Axiom for owners of Anim Workshop v1.0 for
$40.00.

(_____)reating eye-catching flying logo animations just got a whole lot
easier.  Axiom Software announces WaveMaker, a program for the Video Toaster
that makes it easy to create professional flying logo animations for
LightWave 3D.  Simply select your logo and choose how you want it to fly on
and off the screen.  Choose from a comnbination of animated background
elements:

   - Streaks
   - Circles
   - Swirling arcs
   - Starfield
   - Fireworks
   - Confetti
   - and many more!

There are dozens of motions and background elements to choose from.
WaveMaker also includes several pre-fabricated animations that your logo
can be plugged into.  The Animation Sequence function allows you to batch
render any number of LightWave scenes.  WaveMaker comes with a videotape
that shows the different logo motions, animated backgrounds, and pre-fab
animations.  Compatible with the Video Toaster 4000.

                          The A500 SLOTS Expansion
  __________              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 /___  ____/           Phoenix, AZ -- October 28, 1993
     //
    //
   //  MA announces a new product for the A500: The A500 SLOTS expansion.
 /__/  SLOTS allows the use of most A2000 cards on the A500.

SLOTS connects to the expansion edge of the A500 and comes in configurations
of 2, 4 and 5 expansion slots with the expansion boards having optional IBM
XT/AT (8 bit, 16bit) card slots. These slots allow for use of XT/AT emulator
boards such as the A2088 and the A2286. As with the A2000, when used with an
emulator board, these XT/AT slots can use IBM compatible cards. SLOTS is
also great to use with less expensive A2000 Harddrive controllers and memory
cards.

(NOTE: The larger configurations--(4 or more slots)--should be used only on
systems with one of the many expanded power supplies available. A2000 cards
can draw lots of power! However, if the 2 slot board is used, 1 A2000 card
can be used with the standard A500 power supply. Even 2 cards might be
possible depending on what has been added to the system. Also, SLOTS is not
compatible with A2000 multi I/O cards.)

If you can't afford to get an A2000, then SLOTS is the next best alternative
for A500 users!

The cost is as follows:

         SLOTS2                         $ 29.95
         SLOTS2+  (with 2 XT/AT slots)  $ 44.95
         SLOTS4                         $ 57.95
         SLOTS4+  (with 3 XT/AT slots)  $ 77.95
         SLOTS5                         $ 69.95
         SLOTS5+  (with 4 XT/AT slots)  $ 89.95

(____)t was a dark and stormy night. If you could have seen through the storm
clouds above, there would have been a full moon. And it was on THIS Halloween
night that we went trick or treating, my little brother and I. I was in the
5th grade in 1993.

I'll never forget it, it was the first time I ever knocked on the door of The
New Neighbors who had moved onto our street two weeks ago. There were sheets
still at the windows, hanging precariously, and sometimes you could watch the
shadows of people cross them. Mom said she was sure their curtains would
arrive soon. I kept wondering what the eerie glow was late at night, the one
that didn't flicker wildly on the walls like the light of a TV set. I kept
wondering what this terrible screeching noise was which rang out when the
windows were open. Mom gave me one of "Those Looks" and then followed it with
a motherly smile. Yeah, Mom, I'm sure I'll grow out of it, sure. I kept
wondering, but to myself.

Someone in the Neighborhood Watch Group had prepared printed out sheets with
safety tips on them. I colored in the pictures to make them look a little
more gross as Dad intoned them over and over again. Funny, there was no name
on the flier, but it looked really slick. I saw an initial at the bottom,
checked off. "Yes, Dad, I know. We don't go in anywhere. Come on, I'm in the
5th grade now, you DON'T have to come up to the door!" My heart was sinking
rapidly. Surely he would understand a guy has to grow up. He could convince
Mom we could go door to door, yeah, I think he can.

And suddenly, before I knew it, my father was standing clear down on the
corner, and we were approaching the darkened porch of The New Neighbors. The
storming had abated, but it was still cloudy. Candles inside of a number of
jack-o-lanterns lit the sidewalk up to the porch, so we knew they were
expecting kids tonight. The thunder started booming again louder and I looked
up, seeing no lightning. How odd.  We drew closer to the porch, and I knew
before my little brother, that the storm WAS IN THE NEIGHBORS PORCH!  He was
dragging me up the stairs and reaching for the doorbell as the sounds of this
peculiar localized storm grew louder. Geeez, what WAS this?

Before I could stop him, my anxious little sibling had pushed the doorbell.
The storm noise faded and the door began to open. It was dark inside.  An
eerie orange glow seemed to come from behind a dark hooded shape of a ...
person? and then there was a bone chilling scream. I didn't know who they
were killing, but I was determined it wasn't going to be us. I tried pulling
my brother back, and even glanced behind me to see how far my Dad was away.
Geeez, he was talking on the corner to a neighbor. And then, the hooded shape
bent down, and I could see an eerie glowing, moving PUMPKIN just hanging in
mid air, with blood running down over it. I didn't even breathe, just grabbed
my brother and ran! A moment later, when the screaming wasn't staying at the
house porch, I realized that this scream was me...

Well, that was my first experience face to face with The New Neighbors and
their Amiga computer. They told me how they had downloaded (Oh, yeah, *I*
know what that means, but you might want to explain it to Mom...) the
graphics clipart for the flier, the sound effects and the spooky animations.
So THAT was what the funny noises were late at night? And the eerie glow was
a computer monitor.

"Geeez, Mom, see, there wasn't anything weird about it after all. I don't
know what you got so worked up about..." and with a shrug, I explained to her
how they'd used digitized screaming."

          ICD Shares Tip for Using Two Kickstarts with ICD Hardware
                   From the ICD Support RoundTable on GEnie
                                  Page 1220


                          A Tale of Two Kickstarts
 ______                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(__  __)               Copyright ICD -- October 1993
  / /
 / /
(_/his section describes how to configure your system to use both Workbench
1.2/1.3 and Workbench 2.x together on the same system. This information is
particularly useful to owners of Kickstart ROM switching devices such as the
ICD Kickback.

Before proceeding, please keep in mind that there are essentially no
important differences between the FFS provided under 1.3 and 2.x except that
the FFS under 2.x is ROM-based rather that floppy-based. The fact the FFS is
stored in different locations can cause a problem when switching back to
Kickstart 1.3.

If you prep your hard drive under 2.x and you have a copy of the FFS in the
L: directory, the ICDPrepHD program will write that information as part of
the RDB (Rigid Disk Blocks) on the drive (it is not written out as a file).
When you switch back to 1.3 and attempt to boot from the hard drive, and
since there is no FFS file for the system to load, it knows to load the FFS
from the RDB.

If you prep your drive under 2.x and you DO NOT have a copy of the FFS in the
L: directory, the ICDPrepHD program will NOT write the FFS to the partition
blocks (the FFS is ROM ). This causes a problem when you switch back to 1.3.
Since there is no FFS file to load AND there is no FFS written to the RDB,
the system will give up trying to mount those partitions and will report them
as NDOS: or "Not a DOS Disk".

It is not really NOT necessary to re-prep your hard drive to use Kickstart
2.x or its features

Method 1: 1.3 & 2.0 Multiple Startup-Sequence
~~~~~~~~
This describes how to change your Workbench 1.2/1.3 startup- sequence to tell
if you are running Workbench 1.2/1.3 or 2.x and boot the system using the
appropriate startup-sequence file. Sample Startup-sequence files are given
below. This method should be used if your drive is already set up to use
Workbench 1.3.

NOTE: A text editor is needed to create and edit startup- sequences.
~~~~  Workbench provide three editors: MicroEMACS (on the Extras disk),
ED and EDIT (these are in the Workbench C: directory. Consult your AmigaDOS
manuals for the usage of these editors.

You will need to rename you Workbench 1.3 startup-sequence file to Startup13
and you should create a drawer on your hard disk named WB20 (or something to
that effect). All of your Workbench 2.x files and sub-directories should be
copied into this drawer. Copy the Workbench 2.x startup- sequence file to
your Workbench 1.3 S: drawer and rename it to Startup20. The following lines
should be added to the top of the Startup20 file using a text editor.

      Assign ENVARC: DH0:WB20/prefs/env-archive
      Assign C: DH0:WB20/c
      Assign L: DH0:WB20/l
      Assign S: DH0:WB20/s
      Assign T: DH0:WB20/t
      Assign DEVS: DH0:WB20/devs
      Assign LIBS: DH0:WB20/libs
      Assign FONTS: DH0:WB20/fonts
      Assign SYS: DH0:WB20

Create a new startup-sequence file with your text editor using the following
information and copy it to the Workbench 1.3 S: drawer. Make sure you name
this file "Startup- Sequence".

      version >nil: graphics.library 37
      IF WARN
      failat 21
      echo "Booting Workbench 2.x"
      execute s:Startup20
      ELSE
      failat 21
      echo "Booting Workbench 1.3"
      execute s:Startup13


Method 2: 1.3 & 2.x Boot Partitions
~~~~~~~~

This method will allow you to have separate partitions on your hard drive for
Workbench 1.3 and 2.x.

Step 1 - Create two (2) bootable partitions on your selected device using the
~~~~~~   ICDPrepHD program. The Workbench 1.3 partition must be listed first
(Kickstart 1.3 will always boot from the highest priority partition). This
example uses DH0: as the 1.3 partition and DH1: as the 2.x partition.

Step 2 - The ICDPrepHD program will prompt you to insert your Workbench
~~~~~~   disks. When you have finished installing Workbench 1.3, ICDPrepHD
will prompt you to install Workbench again (this is because there are two
bootable partitions on the drive). Just click Cancel to skip this.

Step 3 - Reboot the computer using the Kickstart 2.x ROM and boot the
~~~~~~   computer using the Workbench 2.x Install disk. When Workbench is
loaded, run the proper "Install" program provided by Commodore.

Step 4 - When you have completed installing Workbench 2.x, remove all floppy
~~~~~~   disks and reboot the computer using the CTRL - AMIGA - AMIGA key
combination and hold down BOTH mouse buttons until you see the Boot Select
screen. This screen will allow you to choose which bootable device
(partitions or floppies) that you want to load Workbench from. You should see
the two boot partitions you created plus any floppy drives you may have
attached.  If you wish to load Kickstart 2.x, click on the "DH1" button and
Workbench 2.x will proceed to load.
