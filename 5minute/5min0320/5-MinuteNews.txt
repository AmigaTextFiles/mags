     _____            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   / /___          King of Prussia, PA -- March 14, 1993
  / /(   )
 / (__) /
(______/reat Valley Products announced today that it is set to release
Version 2.0 of its IV24 multifuntional video board.

At the heart of Version 2.0 is enhanced software which greatly increases the
capabilities of the IV24. Especially impressive is the new MacroPaint 2.0
software. This real time, 16 million color paint package features high
performance painting, and features a full color, floating toolbox-style
interface that gives the user the ability to move the toolbox to a more
convenient location. Also new is the ability to load and save JPEG compressed
files. Painting can be done on a 24-bit image, while viewing the work in 12,
15, 18 or 21 bits for faster screen updates and lower Amiga graphics memory
requirements. MacroPaint contains so many new features and enhancements that
it comes with a brand new manual.

A newly designed custom version of Caligari24 gives the user many more
features than the original. Rendering directly to the IV24, Caligari24 now
features an unlimited number of light sources, hierarchial animation which
coordinates the movements of complex objects with their primitive
sub-objects, and free form defamation for more realistic rendering of organic
objects like plants and flowers. Broadcast rendering capabilities ensure
photo realistic representation of scenes. Like MacroPaint, Caligari24 also
comes with a new manual.

MyLad and Desktop Darkroom are also included in this upgrade. MyLad, a
switching package, enables users to enhance their video productions by
utilizing a number of simple, yet creative transitions between video sources,
while Desktop Darkroom offers image capture and complete photo retouching
capabilities, as well as a full range of special effects for image
manupulation and image processing.

According to Bill Prescott, GVP Product Manager, Version 2.0 represents a
major advance in the professional capabilities of the IV24.

"The IV24 with its built-in real time frame grabber, 24-bit frame buffer,
genlock, flicker eliminator, picture-in-picture and highly versatile VIU
(video interface unit) that provides inputs for all video formats and full
transcoding capabilities, has always been a valuable tool for the video
professional, photographer and educator," he notes. "And now with the
addition of this impressive software upgrade, the system represents a
dramatic opportunity for these professionals to optimize their creative
potential and productivity."

A separate IV24 upgrade kit for existing users will begin shipping at the end
of March. It will list in the U.S. for $149.

This major upgrade, which as been eagerly awaited by IV24 owners, consists of
a ROM, several enhanced software packages and new manuals. The version 3.10
ROM allows for A4000 compatibility and also allows the new software to run on
existing IV24 boards.

GVP is a privately held company that was founded in 1988. Today it is the
world's largest third party developer of products for the Commodore Amiga.

           New ADPro Joins Amiga's Most Important Applications
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                      Madison, WI -- March 8, 1993

         In an exclusive first, ADPro now reads and writes images
         in the NewTek Video Toaster Framestore format with full
         broadcast color and fidelity. Taken together with a direct
         memory link to Deluxe Paint 4.6, ASDG's recent ADPro
         upgrade ties together several of the Amiga's most important
    _    applications.
   / \
  / - \
 / ___ \
(_/   \_)SDG Incorporated, the leading innovator in color processing
technology for the Commodore Amiga, announce a major upgrade to their award
winning product, Art Department Professional. The new release contains
several exclusive firsts which increase the level of integration of the
Amiga's most popular imaging tools.

ADPro 2.3 is the first third party product to offer complete support of the
Video Toaster Framestore file format. The new release provides a loader and
saver which can read and write Framestores in full broadcast color and
fidelity.

ADPro's Framestore support does not require a Video Toaster, which
dramatically increases the processing options available to those using
Toaster images. For example, Framestores can be directly manipulated by all
machines on a network including non-Toaster equipped machines. Batch
processing using any of ADPro's extensive manipulation and conversion
capabilities is now quick and easy.

Videographers now have a direct Framestore-to-D1 digital video connection
using ADPro's ABEKAS digital video driver. This is today's most effective
means of moving video data to and from the Amiga and has been used in such
high profile productions as Quantum Leap, Babylon 5 and The American Music
Awards.

ADPro 2.3 also provides an exclusive direct memory link to the newest version
of Deluxe Paint from Electronic Arts, as well as OpalVision's 24 bit-plane
paint program.

These links effectively fuse ADPro with the best painting programs available
today. Said Perry Kivolowitz, President of ASDG, "Our customers didn't want
yet another image processor with mediocre painting capabilities. They want
great image processing and great painting. We've delivered exactly that."

ADPro has direct access to DPaint's memory including its primary, secondary,
and animation buffers. A similar capability is provided for Centaur
Development's OpalPaint.

Users of either paint system can directly load and save images in any file
format which ADPro supports. The same is true for any of ADPro's image
processing capabilities. For example, a Toaster Framestore can be loaded into
OpalPaint, touched up with both programs, and saved to a film recorder.

Said Mr.  Kivolowitz, "We call ADPro, Image Processing's Common Ground. That
title is more true now than ever. We've provided our users a way of joining
their best tools together, making them more productive."

ADPro 2.3 adds many other new capabilities as well. To learn more about the
2.3 upgrade or any of ASDG's other image processing tools, contact Ms. Gina
Cerniglia at 925 Stewart Street, Madison WI, 53713 or call her at (608)
273-6585.


                  Brief Summary Of ADPro 2.3 Upgrade

  o  Direct reading and writing of Video Toaster(1) Framestore files
     without requiring that a Video Toaster be present or running.

  o  Direct connection of ADPro to paint programs.

  o  Undo capability.

  o  ANIM support including the high speed ANIM format, ANIM-8 (with
     viewer).

  o  New loaders, savers, and operators.

  o  Additional ARexx commands making canned applications easier to
     write.

  o  More powerful FRED with over 50 pre-written ARexx programs.

  o  A new digital image compositor allowing multi-layer animations to
     be created easily and quickly.

  o  A totally new utility, SENTRY, which allows you to automatically
     process images as they are generated.

                   British Video Backup System Available
   ____            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  (_  _)       Tip from *StarShip* Member Gerald R. Everett
   / /
 _/ /
(____) thought I'd alert you to a new product you might not have heard about
yet. It is a British product called Video Backup System from a company called
Power Computing Ltd. This is software and a cable (which connects the serial
port to inputs on VCR) which allows you to use a VCR as a tape backup. A 4
hour VHS tape will hold 175 megabytes of data, and you can backup an Amiga
floppy in under a minute. It also allows you to use your monitor as a TV.
[*StarShip* News Network Note: Remember that televisions in the U.S. differ
from those in Europe.]

You can call the company at phone# 01144234841882, or write them at Unit 8
Railton Road, Woburn Road Ind. Estate, Kempton Bedford, England, MK42 7PN.

The price of Video Backup System is 59.95 pounds plus 8 pounds shipping to
U.S. I called, and they said that these units are selling very well there.
They don't have a U.S. distributer, and  I told them they were missing a
large market by not getting one and selling it here. We have no such product,
and it is just what a lot of users need -- really cheap mass storage. We use
our Amigas for animation and art, and that means boxes and boxes of floppies,
or some unjustifiably expensive removable hard disk, or floptical, or stringy
tape thingamajig.


Gerald Everett has earned a FREE Hour on the *StarShip* for this tip to the
5-MINUTE Weekend News! Send your tip via Feedback to the SysOps on page 555.

      SunRize Brings Time Code Generation to Amiga with SMPTE Output (TM)
  ____~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 / ___)
( (__               Silicon Vally, CA -- March 12, 1993
 \__ \
 ___) )
(____/unRize Industries adds to its professional line of audio products for
the Commodore Amiga with SMPTE Output. SMPTE Output is a stand-alone software
product that is used to stripe LTC time code onto audio and video tape. This
unique new software product generates and sends the SMPTE time code out of
the Amiga's audio jack. Time code generators are used in the video, film, and
music industries at the professional through amateur levels and typically
range in price from $350 to $3,000. The list price for SMPTE Output is $249.

SMPTE Output allows your Amiga to be the sync master. An additional and very
important feature is that SMPTE Output locks to the video sync pulse of each
frame of video when used in conjuncion with a genlock or Video Toaster. This
feature, not found on any other product at this price, makes for very
accurate time code generation.

Both NTSC and PAL compatible, SMPTE Output works with any Commodore Amiga
(models A500 and up) containing at least 1 MB of RAM. SMPTE Output wil run
stand alone, or as an expansion module for SunRize's Stuido 16, non-linear,
audio editing systems. Features include: 24, 25, 29.97, and 30 frames per
second time code generation, drop frame and non-drop frame time code,
multiple reset points, fast forward, rewind, play and pause buttons.

Typcal uses for SMPTE Output are: stripe time code onto tape, post-stripe
video tapes that are shot in the field with a camera that does not generate
time code, slave the audio from an audio tape recorder to a video tape
recorder (sync the two decks together), slave high-end video tape recorders
(that can lock to an external time code source) to the Amiga, synchronize
multiple audio tape recorders using a synchronizer box, sync a PC, Mac or
Atari to your Amiga.

SunRize Industries has been developing digital audio solutions for the
Commodore Amiga since 1986. Other SunRize products include Perfect Sound,
Audition 4, and the popular Studio 16 family of hard disk recording and
editing systems for the professional sound and video markets.

Suite 204, Campbell, CA 95008, telephone 408/374-4962, fax 408/374-4963.

          Adspec Programming Announces Version 2.1 of Aladdin 4D
    _     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(_/   \_)dspec Programming is announcing the latest upgrade to its Aladdin 4D
product: Version 2.1. Version 2.1 of Aladdin 4D was released as a FREE
upgrade to all registered users. Registered users should have already
received their upgrade in the mail. Those users who did not yet receive their
upgrade should contact us or send in their registration card. All new
packages are now being sent out with version 2.1 in them. If a customer
puchases a package that contains version 2.0, then s/he will receive version
2.1 auotmatically when they send in their registration card. In addition to
correcting some bugs in the initial release, Aladdin 4D version 2.1 includes
some new features. Here is a list of new features in 2.1:

 o Speed - the new version of Aladdin 4D renders much faster. The amount of
   speed up depends on the drawing, but users can see up to seven times
   speed up in rendering times.

 o Group Levels - Polygons can now belong to up to five different groups.
   The groups are selected by setting the current level. This feature allows
   the grouping of large complex objects while retaining the ability to
   select the individual components parts in a separate group level.

 o Line Types - A new line types attribute has been added to the polygons.
   With the addition of four new types, plus the normal default, polygons
   can be represented in five different ways:

      Normal: the polygon will render in its normal state
      Edges: the polygon will render only along its edges
      Centers: the ploygon will render without edges
      Points: the polygon will render only at its point
      PntCnt: (point center) the polygon will render without its points

    The user can specify both and entry and exit value for the width of the
    edges of points. This feature makes builiding "girdered" objects quick
    and easy.

  o AGA Support - Version 2.1 of Aladdin 4D now includes support for the AGA
    machines. The program will recognize and allow the user to render the
    drawing in the new HAM8 mode. These modes can be quite effective and
    compare favorably to 24-bit displays. Aladdin 4D wil also use the HAM8
    IFF files as textures and can save out Opcode 5 HAM8 animations.

  o Art Expression Support - Aladdin 4D will now read in the encapsulated
    PostScript files from Soft Logik's Art Expressions program.

                            Recycle Computer Books
 _  __  _                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
( \/  \/ )       Bellevue, WA -- 1993 MAR 5 (from Newsbytes)
 \      /
  \_/\_/ant that book on Filemaker Pro but hate to spend the big bucks? A
start-up company has an idea for you -- buy it used from their used computer
book library.

Oscar Steele, manager for Purple Mountain Computers, says the firm has
existed for some time specializing in the Atari ST, and publishing ST News, a
small newspaper that has a listing of software for sale, as well as current
ST news. With the success of that venture, the company is now expanding into
the sale of used books and software for various platforms.

He claims there are no copyright problems in reselling software, in
particular. "The documentation, the disks, must be 100% original, so
everything is on the up and up."

Purple Mountain Computers actually calls its operation a "recycling program"
for computer books, magazines, and software in which users can buy, sell and
trade their unwanted items for ones they do want. Trial testing of the
so-called CompuCycle program has been a success, according to the company,
which adds that all computers are supported, including PC, Mac, Amiga, Atari
ST and 8-bit, Apple, Commodore 64, and CP/M.

The company's inventory, from programming to how-to's with software, number
10,500 computer books/magazines and the firm also claims to have 1,100
programs. "We have tons of books, literally,"  Steele tells Newsbytes. But he
says the company is buying books and software too. "If somebody wants to
trade for something we have, we are more than happy to do that." In fact, he
says, that is his preferred way of doing business.

"We believe that everyone can benefit from this program. Users will pay less
for software and can turn unused programs and books into cash or wanted
items.  And society will benefit from the utilization of our current
resources, instead of wasting new ones."

PMC publishes CompuNews which includes the list of available recycled
software. CompuNews is free to anyone who requests it. But if you really want
to help the environment, the firm's thousands of books are listed  on disk to
conserve paper -- this disk catalog is available for $1.

Purple Mountain Computers describes itself as "an environmentally conscious
company made up of a programmer, a college student, office manager,
housewife, engineer, and a receptionist. (206) 399-8700 is the firm's phone
number, online you can reach them via Genie at PMC.INC, or on Compuserve at
72567,302.
