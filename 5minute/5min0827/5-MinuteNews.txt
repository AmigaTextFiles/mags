           Commodore Announces (U.S.) Introduction of the Amiga CD32

(_____)ommodore Business Machines today announced the introduction of the
Amiga CD32 to be held at the World of Commodore Amiga Show in Pasadena,
California, on September 10, 1993. The new Amiga CD32, a 32-bit game consol
with a double-speed CD-ROM drive, is based on the very successful Advanced
Graphics Architecture(TM) chip set. It can display and animate graphics in
256,000 colors to create realistic, three-dimensional graphics and animations
for games and video applications.

Similar in appearance to other types of game consoles, the Amiga CD32
includes a hand-held, 11-button game controller and connectors for standard
Amiga mouse, joystick and keyboard. The Amiga CD32 is easily connected to a
TV set, composite monitor or SVHS video monitor.

The Amiga CD32 provides users with access to many existig CDTV game and
reference titles. Psygnosis, Ocean, Acclaim, Virgin Games and other notable
game developers are introducing new games for the Amiga CD32. About 30 games
are expected to be available by October, 1993.

An optional MPEG module allows software developers to incorporate video,
movie segments and TV-like backgrounds into their applications. This
technology provides game enthusiasts with a new class of action-packed games
that include CD-quality sound. The Amiga CD32 plays VideoCD industry standard
full-motion music videos and movies as well as standard audio CDs and CD+G
discs.

Price for the Amiga CD32 will be competitive with the price of 16-bit sytems.

(_/he new Commodore machine that everyone's been waiting for was recently
released in London's Science Museum. We [the British magazine Amiga Mart]
sent a team of journalists to cover the event.

What follows are a series of keynote addresses by the Commodore hierarchy.


Introduction by Commodore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Medhi Ali - President of Commodore

We are very proud to be launching the Amiga CD32 player. We believe this
product demonstrates our technological superiority and our strong desire to
compete and excel. More importantly, we believe this product has great market
potential and will be a very significant factor in the turnaround of our
company. We are very proud of Commodore's long history of product innovation
- Commodore introduced the PET in 1976 which was the world's first
self-contained computer. That product's success was followed by the Commodore
64 which we are still selling today in Eastern Europe and 15 million units
have been sold to date. In 1987 Commodore introduced the Amiga 500 which was
proclaimed the most superior machine for three years running by European
journalists. We introduced a new generation of computers with the A1200 and
the A4000 for the professional market.

The Amiga today is the true state-of-the-art multi-media computer. We are
also proud of the fact that the installed base of the Amiga is 4.5 million
units. We are once again a pioneer with the introduction of this CD-ROM based
games machine. This machine truly provides the new benchmark in both
performance and affordability for home entertainment systems. It is vastly
superior on a price/performance basis to any competitive product on the
market today. It will maintain its competitive superiority against various
products reputed to be under development.

The market opportunity for this product is phenomenal. The home video market
worldwide is estimated to be over $10billion, more than twice the movie
theatre market. The home video market for arcade quality games is also
estimated to be several billions of dollars. We expect over 15 new software
titles to be available on the launch of this new machine. This is more titles
than currently available for a competitive platform introduced last year.

Recently, the personal computer industry has become exceedingly competitive
especially due to falling prices and margins. The recession in Europe has
also had a major adverse effect on Commodore since Europe accounts for nearly
90% of our total sales. Our financial results last year were very
disappointing but we are not waiting around for an upturn in the economic
cycle. Significant changes and restructuring of the company have been made
and although we have cut down on our staff levels we are still intent on
making enhancements to the Amiga's capabilities and future developments. We
are committed and well on our way to making faster and more significant
enhancements to the Amiga next year in order to maintain our leadership role
in multi-media. We believe with the launch of the Amiga CD32 we can regain a
prominent role in the computer industry in the 1990s.


Specs and Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Lew Eggebrecht - Commodore's Vice President of Engineering

About a year ago we were deeply involved in the development of the A4000 and
the A1200, our games system. We had come to the point where we had proven
that our 32-bit architectured chip set was fully operational, met our
performance goals and also met our cost targets. We then began to investigate
other opportunities that we could apply this technology to so we began to
extend its capabilities into new market areas. UK's strong Amiga game market
and multi-media penetration by the CDTV led us to the conclusion that we
needed a new product in this multi-media type area.

First the product had to be based on our 32-bit technology and it also had to
be cost competitive. We began with a plan, which was started in October of
last year, where we developed a detailed specification of the product. We
then set out a goal of developing this product in a time period of eight
months. The idea was to have it completed and ready for pilot production in
May - a goal we did achieve. We had the technology, we had the software,
development support, development materials, we had everything that was
necessary, we were capable of building upon our CDTV experience but there
were still a lot of questions that needed to be answered about the exact form
the product would take.

We went to the developers and asked them, basically, what would you do, what
type of machine would you build if you had 32-bit technology, 32-bit
processor and what would the characteristics of this machine be - would it be
CDTV compatible, A1200 compatible, should it be cartridge based, should it be
CD ROM based? There are many other marketing issues, price point, competitive
issues - we went to the developers and asked their input. What would this
dream machine be?

As a result we came to the conclusion that it had to be 32-bits, and price
competitive with 16-bit technology but we knew this would be a difficult
task, almost impossible, some said it couldn't be done and that it was far,
far distant in the future. The ultimate drawback would be the price!

From a demo of a Psygnosis game we are able to show the capabilities of the
machine which include: richness in colour - 256 colours out of 16 million
plus an extended mode with many more millions of variations. We had to
develop an enhanced version of Amiga Dos - this machine contains an entire
Amiga Dos operating system. It also had to have extensions to the operating
system to support two speeds on high density CD-ROM with outstanding
performance characteristics. It also had to be compatible with A1200 software
and CDTV software. We had to make all these changes to the operating system
and convert it to ROM. We had to design a new gate array which turned out to
be very complex and incorporated many of the chips that are normally in the
Amiga system. It contains 37,000 gates well over 100,000 transistors and we
got it right first time.

The Amiga CD32 is the world's first consumer 32-bit console. It uses the same
AGA graphics chip set as our A4000 work station. It has a Motorola 32-bit, 14
MHz 68EC020 processor, 2Mb 32-bit Chip RAM, two joystick ports/controller
ports, S-Video jack, composite video jack, RF output jack, stereo audio
jacks, keyboard connector/auxiliary connector, full expansion bus, headphone
jack, headphone volume control, external brick power supply, internal MPEG
FMV expansion capability, multiple session disc capability. It also has 1Mb
of ROM containing Amiga Dos and all of the extensions to graphic libraries
they support. With two-speed multi-session drop, it also has a bookmark and
non- volatile memory for storing high scores and uses 1000 bytes of flash
memory in the system. You can literally attach any type of video output
device. It also supports stereo line-out for attachment to stereo equipment,
it supports both the Amiga sound system and Amiga's CD sound capability, both
16-bit. It supports audio play and two game controller ports, which can be
expanded to eight controllers on each port and is also compatible with all
existing peripheral devices that attach to the control or auxiliary ports,
including mice and joysticks. We also have a special port on this system, a
very high performance serial port, that is compatible with the Amiga keyboard
port plus has an RS232 serial port built into it. The purpose of this port
was to allow extension of a number of additional devices on the system
including the performance necessary for virtual reality type peripherals. We
also have a full expansion port built into this system which makes available
the peripheral devices, the full processor bus, the full video and audio bus
with this system.

One example of a device that plugs into that is what we call a full-motion
video module. This will allow you to play 74 minutes of VHS quality video. We
have a graphical user interface that defines the user interface to both the
audio and video portions of the player. The set up is very similar to a VCR.

With COMPUTE's announcement about the demise of its Amiga Resource, we
thought it might be a good time to talk to Denny, who has been our editor of
the Resource.

Denny's new book this year is chock full of Amiga hints and tips, and no
cocktail party small talk is complete without at least one or two quotes from
it.  And no new Amiga owner should be allowed to walk out the store without a
copy!

Bring your copy of Denny's book and hold it up to the monitor so he can give
you a virtual autograph.  He'll do it, too!  Great fun, that Denny.

   \_/\_/ith it's July/August 1993 edition, Computer Virus Catalog describes
more forms of Malicious Code = MalCodes (including chain letters, time bombs,
trojan horses, viruses and worms) on multiple platforms (IBM and compatible
PCs, Macintosh, IBM-MVS/VM, UNIX, Amiga and Atari).

Presently, ***340 MalCodes*** have been classified active on 6 platforms:

          Amiga:       92 Viruses, 1 Trojan, 5 TimeBombs
          Atari:       20 Viruses
          Macintosh:   35 Viruses, 2 Trojans
          MSDOS:      172 Viruses, 6 Trojans, 3 Virus Generators
          MVS/VM:                  1 Chain Letter
          UNIX:         2 Viruses, 1 Worm

Entries for UNIX Internet Worm and IBM-VM CHRISTMA.EXEC are yet experimental
(in "old" CVC format 1.2). A generalized format (2.0) for the Computer
MalCode Catalog will be available, including descriptions of DEC-VMS worms
(Father Christmas, WANK and OILZ), with next edition (planned: December
1993).

New CVC entries are available in ASCII, and all entries are available either
via CVBASE.EXE (the electronic edition of CVC, for PCs) or as compressed
(PKZIPPED) files. See Virus Test Center's FTP site.

~~~~~~~~~~~
Interactive MicroSystems' MediaEditor program makes copying selected segments
from player video decks to a recorder easy. Video tapes are "logged" into the
edit decision list by pressing the Return key as the tape plays. Script
commands are selected to play back and record graphics and animation files,
as well as to control switchers ad genlockss for A/B-Rolls, special effects
and title overlays. Scenes and effects are previewed and recorded
automatically under computer control.

 * Insert & Assembly Editing             * Animation & Graphics Recording
 * 99 Page Edit Decision List            * "On-the-Fly" Tape Logging
 * Prosumer & Industrial Deck Control    * Time Code Tape Positioning
 * Genlock Control for Title Overlays    * Laser & Compact Disc Control
 * Toaster Control for Special Effects   * Audio Cassette & DAT Control
 * Switcher Control for A/B-Roll         * Time-of-Day & Continuous Playback

Use MediaController's screen icon and keyboard interface to perform routine
dvice control tasks. Send infrared and serial commands with a keystroke or
the click of a mouse. Run several MediaController programs at once to control
all of your media devices.

TCGen generates time code directly from the computer audio port. Additional
hardware is not required. Run TCGen to stripe your video and audio tapeas
with industry standard SMPTE or EBU time code. MediaEditor reads time code
during pre-roll to correct tape position to +/-1 frame.
