Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) product line with the addition of the
new Amiga 4000-030 desktop computer. The Amiga 4000-030 is a lower cost
version of the company's Amiga 4000-040 that was introduced in September
1992. The system is expected to be available at Commodore authorized
resellers by the end of the month at a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price
of $2399.00.

Like the A4000-040 and A1200, the A4000-030 contains Commodore's AGA custom
co-processor chip set which enables users to display and animate graphics in
multiple resolutions at up to 256,000 colors from a palette of 16.8 million.

with 2MB of chip RAM, 2 MB of fast RAM and 120MB IDE hard drive. The unit
also ships with AmigaDOS Release 3, the latest version of Commodore's
multitasking operating system. AmigaDOS Release 3 takes advantage of the new
AGA features while maintaining backward compatibility with Amiga software not
written specifically for AGA machines.

"Commodore is committed to expanding its AGA line of computers to meet the
computing requirements and budgets of all multimedia users," commented
Geoffrey Stilley, vice president of sales for Commodore Business Machines,
Inc. "The Amiga 4000-030 is proof of this commitment. It provides users the
capabilities and performance enhancements of the AGA chip set at a
considerable cost savings."

Commodore Business Machines, Inc., based in West Chester, PA, is the U.S.
subsidiary of Commodore International Limited. The company manufacturers and
markets a complete line of Amiga computers and peripherals for the business,
consumer, education and government markets. The company's worldwide installed
user base of Amiga computers is presently nearly four million.

|  Many of you are involved in creative applications using features that   |
|  only the Amiga can provide. We want the rest of the world to discover   |
|  the ease of use and the cost saving benefits of Amiga technology.       |

        Centaur Announces Pricing and Availability of OpalVision Products
    ____~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / ___)
  / /               Los Angeles, CA -- March 5, 1993
 / (__
(_____)entaur Development announced today pricing and availability of the
enhancement modules for its modular OpalVision 24-bit graphics and Video
System.

The OpalVision Main Board, available since last August, has earned a
reputation as the best of the 24-bit Amiga boards. It is a true 24-bit
display device and framebuffer with 16.7 million colors available for every
pixel. The bundled software includes the award-winning OpalPaint, widely
acknowledged in the press as the very best of Amiga painting programs.

The three new enhancement modules add a wide array of additional, previously
unannounced features to the OpalVision system:

OpalVision Video Processor

The OpalVision Video Processor plugs directly in the Main Board. It is a
real-time, 24-bit framegrabber, a professional quality genlock with chroma
and luma keying and includes the OpalVision Roaster Chip for unlimited
transitions, color processing and Digital Video Effects. It also includes
controlling software for all functions and a 24-bit, 35ns character
generator.

OpalVision Suite

The OpalVision Suite is a complete audio and video mixing, switching and
transcoding device. It is a 19-inch, rack-mountable external unit with 9
video and 10 audio inputs. Video inputs and outputs are available
simultaneously in RGB or Y/R-Y/B-Y, composite and S-Video. Its linear
transparency key provides transparency control between 2 video sources on a
pixel-by-pixel basis. The audio mixer is fully software sequenced with smooth
fades and full 5-band stereo frequency equalization.

OpalVision Scan-Rate Convertor

The OpalVision Scan-Rate Convertor also plugs into the Main Board. It
converts PAL and NTSC signals to 31kHz for non-interlaced, flicker-free
display of Amiga and OpalVision graphics and live video. It operates with any
multi-sync/multi-scan monitor. Additionally, the Scan-Rate Convertor includes
a full, infinite window Time Base Corrector which operates in RGB for
excellent quality.

All three of the additional modules will be available this Spring and will
have a Suggested Retail Price of $995.00 each. OpalVision automaticaly
self-configures for both PAL and NTSC video modes and works with the Amiga
2000, 3000 and 4000 models.

           Egciting Coloring Contest from The *StarShip* on GEnie

(______/et your Amiga warmed up and your favorite paint and animation program
ready to color eggs!

We like simple contests, so here's the gist of it...

You work up your BEST Amiga artwork around the theme of colored Easter Eggs.

Upload it to the *StarShip* from now until April 5th.  Use the special
     Library set aside Eggsactly for these pictures.

On April 7th, the polls open and ALL *StarShip* members will have ONE VOTE
     each to select their favorite entries.  (The *StarShip* crew has
     chickened out on deciding between so many great entries!)

You MUST own all rights to your entry and it must be an original Amiga
     created picture/animation.

Scanned entries will be disqualified.

You may enter as many times as you like. [We may hate ourselves for this
     rule, but hey, live and learn.]

You may submit an animation or a still picture.  You may use any commonly
     available Amiga graphics mode.  The picture/animation MUST fit on
     a regular or overscanned Amiga-sized monitor screen.  If you wish
     to create a picture using enhanced video/graphics [DCTV, 24-bit
     boards, etc.] you might consider uploading two files in your archive
     so that your entry can be viewed by those with only standard Amigas.
     Remember, your Amiga friends online will be the ones who view entries
     and cast votes!

You MUST include a text file telling how you created your egg including what
     equipment used (particularly for renderings, 24-bit entries, etc.) and
     the resolution you used.  Acceptable entries include hand [mouse]-drawn
     or rendered art. Animations, morphing, 24-bit, whatever you like --
     But NO scanning is allowed!

You MUST include some sort of colored egg(s) in your art submission!


And what might you win?!  We're making up several Baskets of goodies for the
winners!  There's $100 of GEnie-bucks, there's an autographed copy of Denny
Atkin's "Best Amiga Tips and Secrets" book, there's 100 3.5 DS/DD diskettes,
There's $50 of GEnie-bucks, there's deb's favorite new book discovery
"Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time" a delightful illustrated journal of the
world of James Gurney - where Dinosaurs and people still live side by side.
[Theres talk about the possibility of large painted eggs and perhaps some
Amiga software....] And there's more!

Look in the Library for a blank Egg you can download to get started if you
need, and then let's see what you and your Amiga can do!  There's not much
time until Spring Break when the voting starts.  Polls will close at 8 PM
Eastern time on Sunday, April 11th.

Winners will be announced on Sunday, April 11th, at the Amiga Graphics
Conference on the *StarShip*. You do NOT need to be present to win. The
conference will begin at 10 PM Eastern time. Winners wil be notified by GE
Mail and MUST respond with their street mailing address within a week.

::Fine Print::  Employees of GEnie and members of the *StarShip* and other
GEnie RoundTable staffs are not eligible to win.

Contest Recap:

1. Enter by uploading your eggciting, original art before Monday, April 5.
2. Voting will be open from April 7 through 8PM EST on April 11.
3. Winners will be announced at the Graphics Conference on Sunday, April 11.

   from the clipboard, maps the ANSI characters back into input events,
   and adds them to the input stream to allow pasting into any window,
   string gadget, etc. This version uses a more internationally compatible
   method of preventing translation to numeric pad raw key values. See
   conpaste.doc for more info.

and multimedia producers is a series of self-playing music disks transcribed
by talented Amiga musician Rob Baxter available in the *StarShip* Library.
