(_____)ommodore Applications and Technical Support Group (CATS) sponsored a
Developers Conference in Orlando, Florida, from January 26-30. A record
number of four hundred developers from thirteen countries attended the
conference to learn more about Commodore's plans and new developments for the
Amiga(R) line of personal computers.

Representatives from CATS, Commodore's Engineering staff and Commodore's
sales divisions were on hand to conduct seminars and meet with developers.
More than forty sessions were held during the five-day conference. Among the
presenters were representatives from Motorola and the American Management
Association. Over 700 pages of documentation and four disks were prepared for
distribution to developers in attendance.

"The Developers Conference offers us the opportunity to share with developers
our corporate direction and implementation strategy, as well as receive
feedback from from developers on our plans," said John Campbell, CATS
director. "The success of this year's conference was apparent through the
many comments we received from the record number of quality developers
present at the conference."

Amiga software and peripheral developers selected top products released in
1992 in six categories. The developers of the selected products were
presented with awards at a luncheon held at the conference. The names of the
selected products, as well as the latest product to be inducted into the
"Amiga Hall of Fame" are listed below.

Commodore International Limited, through its subsidiaries around the world,
is a manufacturer and marketer of a wide range of computer-based products for

 (_/our Amiga needs your help now!

The voice of Amy and her future sister machines is in jeopardy. As you might
know, Commodore has withdrawn the speech files from the new operating system.
Although the hardware is capable, the new machines are mute.

You have the power to control the Amiga's destiny (and your own). If you take
ACTION there will be a REACTION.

If you write, they will listen. There are no guaranties except for INACTION.

Join an international write-in campaign -- probably the most massive,
organized effort ever attempted for the Amiga or possibly any computer. Print
out the enclosed files, one for individuals and one for user groups or write
your own. Sign and mail them, give them to other users, get user group
members to sign them. Mail them to Mr. Ned McCook at Commodore (address in
file). From a very reliable source, he is the person who needs to know your
mind.

Your Amiga, the multi-tasking, multi-media, multi-talented computer -- the
one the others emulate (however badly) -- needs you now! Help make March 1993
the month over 3 million Amiga users MARCH FORTH!

Post this on all BBS's and anywhere the total force and muscle of the Amiga
reside.

Mr. Ned McCook
Director, Software Engineering
Commodore Business Machines
1200 Wilson Drive
West Chester, PA  19380

Dear Mr. McCook,

I am very concerned about the decision to discontinue the speech capability
in the latest operating system (2.1, 3.0). This has been one of the
distinguishing characteristics of Amiga computers since the first A1000 went
into service. Third party add-ons are appearing for the MacIntosh and IBM
compatibles and I feel that this is not the time to relinquish speech ability
for ANY reason.

History shows that the Amiga has been a magnetic force in directing the
course of computing. The fact that other platforms have tried to emulate the
purposes and inborn qualities of the Amiga proves that the vision of the
original designers was long and true. Now is not the time to compromise that
vision, but to continue to enhance it.

I hope that you will reconsider this decision and act positively, as only a
negative impact will result otherwise, for the Amiga community and for
Commodore.

Talking machines and machines that understand speech will be part of the
future wave -- a wave that is building right now.


                                        Sincerely,

                                        /signature/

     _____       GVP To Release SCSI/RAM Card for the A1200
    / ____)      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / /___         King of Prussia, PA -- February 16, 1993
  / /(   )
 / (__) /
(______/VP announced today it will release a multifunctional SCSI/RAM/FPU
board for Commodore's new A1200 sometime in March.

Called the A1200 SCSI/RAM+, this versatile board features 32-bit RAM
expansion capabilities, a high speed SCSI interface and a socket for an FPU
(6882 math coprocessor) which dramatically improves floating point
operations. The A1200 SCSI/RAM+ will be available in two configurations.

The "Low-Cost" A1200 SCSI/RAM+ carries a suggested retail price of $360.00
and features GVP's well known high speed SCSI interface and comes with 0MB of
RAM and no FPU, while the "Power Up" version, retailing at $599.00, offers
the same high speed SCSI interface and includes an FPU and 4MB of 32-bit RAM.

Featuring the fastest SCSI interface ever designed by GVP, the A1200
SCSI/RAM+ will also accept up to 8MB of 60ns 32-bit wide DRAM. Using either
standard GVP SIMM 32-1MB SIMMS or GVP 32-4MB SIMMS, the board can be
configured in 0, 2, 4 or 8MB increments, all running at 0 wait states. The
optional FPU can be clocked at 14 MHz, along with the A1200's system clock,
or independently at speeds up to 40 MHz.

"By capitalizing on its extensive experience in the Amiga add-on market, GVP
has produced a board that is capable of transforming the A1200 into the
ultimate low-cost workstation. The SCSI/RAM+ is the ideal peripheral for
animators, image manipulators, audio and music designers," comments Jeff
Boyer, GVP's Vice President of Engineering.

GVP is a privately held company that was founded in 1988. Today it is the
world's largest developer of peripherals for the Commodore Amiga. For more
information about their products, contact your local Amiga Dealer or Great
Valley Products, 600 Clark Ave., King of Prussia, PA 19406, or telephone
215/337-8770, fax 215/337-9922.

         Migraph Announces CS-6000 Color Hand Scanner for the Amiga
    _  _ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \/ \            Federal Way, WA -- February 15, 1993
  /      \
 / /\  /\ \
(_/  \/  \_)igraph, Inc., developer of scanner and graphics solutions, today
announced the development of the Migraph CS-6000 color hand scanner for Amiga
systems.

"Since the release of the Migraph monochrome hand scanner in 1991, Migraph
has been besieged with requests for a color hand scanner," states Migraph
president Kevin Mitchell. "The CS-6000 color hand scanner is the logical
continuation of our product line. It offers the end user the capability of
capturing over a quarter of a million colors in a single pass, at an
affordable price. Not only that, but it also  functions as the first true
greyscale hand scanner for the growing Amiga desktop publishing market."

The retail price for the Migraph Color Hand Scanner is $549. This includes
the scanner, interface, power supply, and color scanning software.

Features

The Migraph CS-6000 color hand scanner has these powerful features:

  * Capable of recognizing and scanning up to 262,144 colors
  * Six scanning resolutions: 50-400 dots per inch (dpi)
  * Five scanning modes: Super Color Mode (262,144 colors), Color Mode
    (4096 colors), Greyscale, Monochrome Dither Halftone, and
     Monochrome/line art (text)
  * Four inch wide (105 mm) scanning window
  * Software to scan and save color, greyscale, and monochrome images in
    popular file formats
  * True greyscale scanning enables the user to scan 64 true greyscale
    levels at 400 dpi
  * Compatible with Workbench v1.3, v2.x, and v3. The new AGA chipset is
    also supported.
  * Convenient Start/Stop scanning switch
  * Adjustable brightness control
  * Compact parallel interface with a cable to allow ease of installation.

"The Migraph CS-6000 color hand scanner allows users of all level systems to
scan color images quickly and easily for use in on-screen multimedia
applications, slide presentations, desktop publishing and more," states Kevin
Mitchell. "For applications that require the capturing of flat graphics, the
CS-6000 color hand scanner removes the issues of lenses and lighting, is far
less expensive than a camera/digitizer combination, offers truer and more
consistent colors and is easier to use. For anyone needing color graphics
that are smaller than a full page, the Migraph CS-6000 provides the optimum
solution."

Introductory Special

For a limited time Migraph is offering an introductory special on the CS-6000
color hand scanner when purchased direct from Migraph. Customers may purchase
the CS-6000 for $399.00 plus applicable shipping through April 30, 1993. This
special also includes free software upgrades through June 30, 1993.

System Requirements

The Migraph CS-6000 color hand scanner requires an Amiga with 1MB of RAM,
however 2MB is recommended.

Distribution

The Migraph CS-6000 is available direct from Migraph and through selected
Amiga dealers. For further information on Migraph and its products, call
206/838-4677 or fax 206-838-4702.

 _/ /
(____)nterested in Medical Graphics? Pathologists, physicians, scientists and
medical technologists, join us in Chicago, March 30, 1993, at the National
Spring Meeting of the American Association of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP),
in a 3 1/2 hour, hands-on Amiga workshop on Medical Graphics and Multimedia
applications in Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.

Digital Imaging in Pathology

Quota: 45 pathologists and medical technologists

This is a hands-on workshop that addresses the application of pathology
images (creating, storing, retrieving, manipulating, and transmitting) to
microcomputers. The workshop consists of three sessions that include the
principles of digital imaging, the methods of digitizing, and the creating of
multimedia and authoring programs. Participants are given the opportunity to
reinforce each of the above lecture-demonstration sessions during the
hands-on computer laboratory portion of the workshop using Amiga computers
from Commodore. The instructors have a long-standing special interest in
digital imaging and have worked with several simple and affordable
microcomputers which support graphics, sound, and home video equipment.

    ___  ___             It's Time for CLIK-CLAK!!
   (_  )(  _)            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    / /_/ /         Marina del Rey, CA -- February 1993
   / __  /
 _/ / / /
(___)(__)OLLYWARE Entertainment is pleased to announce the release of
CLIK-CLAK. CLIK-CLAK is available through normal distribution centers or may
be purchased directly from HOLLYWARE Entertainment.

Get ready for some fast-paced fun! CLIK-CLAK is an addictive gear game that
allows you to transform twelve Wonders of the Ancient and Modern World into
time pieces. You build the inner mechanisms by linking together gears of
different sizes and colors into the proper sequence while struggling against
time, heat and two gremlin-like creatures that torment you by rusting the
gears or breaking off the mounting pegs.

This visually innovative game will test your reflexes, engineering skills and
your nerves. Remember time is tick, tick, ticking away! Just like any other
machine there are bugs, in this case poffins, that try to damage the
mechanism by rusting the gears and breaking off the mounting pegs. But there
are ways around them, like shooting 'em, but be careful not to use all your
ammunition. There is also an oil can that will "lube up" any rusted gears.

Features

 o Twelve levels of action divided into sublevels to test your intelligence.
 o Use bombs to blow up improperly placed gears and use the oil can to
   free-up rusted gears.
 o Use the gun sight to knock the gremlins off the play screen.
 o Test your reflexes with the slot machine between sublevels to increase
   your score and necessary supplies.
 o Code word access to any completed level
 o Manual based copy protection

The music and the sound effects for CLIK-CLAK add fun and tension as you try
and solve this puzzling twelve level game. Another fun feature CLICK-CLAK has
is a slot machine set up between levels so that you can add to your score or
get additional supplies. There is an access code given after completing a
level.

CLIK-CLAK has been called the "Tetris" of the 90's. Some have nick-named it
"the hair puller." We think you will call it "endless fun!"

CLIK-CLAK is the most unique and original idea for a puzzle game to come
along in a very long time.

CLIK-CLAK will be available on the Amiga, IBM and Commodore formats. Game Boy
and Game Gear versions will be available in the third quarter of 1993.

Suggested retail:  $49.95 for Amiga and IBM versions
                   $39.95 for Commodore 64 version

Entertainment, 13464 Washington Blvd., Marine del Rey, CA 90291, telephone
