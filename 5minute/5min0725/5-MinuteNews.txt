             Commodore Extends Amiga 2000 Power Up Promotion
            and Offers the Program Savings to Amiga 3000 Owners

(_____)ommodore Business Machines, Inc. today announced it is extending the
Amiga 2000 power up program, offering special savings for Amiga 2000 owners
on the purchasse of an Amiga 4000 series computer, through July 31, 1993. The
company is also expanding the Power Up program to include owners of Amiga
3000 series computers. Promotional pricing is $2349(*) for the A4000-040/120
and $1599(*) for the A4000-030/120, repressenting substantial savings of
$1350 and $800 respectively, based on Maufacturer's Suggested Retail Prices.

"The success of the Amiga 2000 Power Up program and feedback from our
established Amiga 3000 customer base encouraged us to expand the program to
include A3000 owners," commented James Dionne, president and general manager
of Commodore Business Machines, Inc. "Extending the promotion through the end
of July will allow A3000 owners to take advantage of the substantial Power Up
savings and enable us to meet the growing demand for Amiga 4000 products."

The Power Up program is designed to position the Amiga 4000 computer as the
new base platform for development of future Amiga products. The promotion
provides current Amiga 2000 and 3000 computer owners with the opportunity to
puchase an Amiga 4000 at a substantial cost savings. By not requiring current
users to trade-in their A2000 and 3000 systems the program also protects
their investment in software and add-on hardware.

To receive the promotional pricing purchasers must provide the front cover of
their Amiga 2000 or 3000 owners manual and the system serial number. Power Up
program pricing is available at the time of purchase through participating
Commodore Authorized Resellers in the United States.

The high performance A4000-040/120 and A4000-030/120 both feature Commodore's
Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) chip set, enabling users to display and
animate graphics in multiple resolutioins at up to 256,000 colors from a
palette of 16.8 million. Both systems include AmigaDOS(tm) Release 3,
Commodore's multitasking operating system that takes advantage of AGA
features while maintaining backward compatability with most software
developed for earlier versions of AmigaDOS. Backward compatibility is also
maintained for most peripheral products originally designed for the Amiga
2000 or 3000 computers.

Commodore Business Machines, Inc., bassed in West Chester, PA, is the U.S.
subsidiary of Commodore International Limited. The company manufactures and
markets a complete line of Amiga computers and peripherals for the business,
consumer, education and government markets. The company's worldwide installed
user base of Amiga computers is presently almost four million.

Commodore-Amiga Inc.

(*)A2000 and 3000 Power Up promotional pricing is subject to reseller
participation. Actual reseller pricing may vary. See reseller for further
details.

(_____)ommodore Business Machines, Inc. and The Service Management Group,
Inc. today announced an outsourcing agreement in which the SGM will provide
all post sale support to Commodore resellers, OEMs, VARs and end users. Under
the terms of this agreement, the SMG will administer the U.S. warranty
program for Commodore. Commodore products are currently covered by a one
year, parts and labor warranty provided through Authorized Commodore
resellers and service centers. Beginning today Commodore resellers and
service centers will work with the SMG for all warranty-related activities.

The Service Mangement Group will also act as the U.S. distributor for
Commodore parts. The agreement is expected to eventually include the repair
and refurbishment of all defective products, repair component mangement and
end-of-life logistics and materials management.

Commodore also announced that it is unbundling end user product support
offerings effective today. After an extensive study of the current customer
service programs and consultation with Commodore resellers, service centers
and end users, CBM decided to restructure both the Commodore Express(tm) and
Gold Service Programs. These nationally recognized programs will now be
unbundled, permitting Commodore customers to select the service that best
meets their individual needs. The Gold Service Programs will be available
through the Service Mangement Group. Under Gold Service, Commodore end users
can select a variety of coverage options for their Commodore Amiga systems
and the most popular third-party items purchased for these systems. These
coverages include dealer, depot or on-site support in the United States.

"Commodore end users are a very diverse and demanding group," commented James
Dionne, President and General Manager of Commodore Business Machines, Inc.
"Their support requirements range from self maintenance to total turnkey
support. Commodore is committed to meeting each of these support requirements
with the highest quality service at the lowest cost to the customer.
Outsourcing our support program to the SMG permits us to not only meet these
requirements, but to keep Commodore support among the best in the industry."
The SMG provides customer support through a network of Authorized Commodore
resellers and service centers, as well as a nationwide service provider.

The SMG will also provide support for both Commodore Authorized resellers and
service centers. These programs are slated to include a technical help desk,
staffed by engineering personnel specifically trained to assist dealers and
service centers, as well as technical publications and on-line bulletin
boards.

"We are very proud of the work we have done with Commodore over the past
three years," noted Paul Bielski, President of the SMG. "With programs such
as Commodore Express Gold Service and the SMG Extended Warranty, Commodore
has been able to meet the needs of the most demanding customers, while
improving quality and reducing cost. We are proud to have had the opportunity
to design, implement and manage these efforts for Commodore."

The SMG announced that it will be expanding its headquarters in Columbia,
Maryland, and will add new facilities and personnel in the West Chester,
Pennsylvania and Memphis, Tennessee areas.

Commodore Business Machines, Inc., based in West Chester, PA, is the U.S.
subsidiary of Commodore International Limited. The company manufactures and
markets a complete line of Amiga computers and peripherals for the business,
consumer, education and government markets.

The Service Management Group, Inc., located in Columbia, MD, is a

          Prime Image Introduces Plug-In Digital Standards Converter
            Board for NTSC, PAL, PAL-M, SECAM, PAL-N & NTSC 4.43
    ____    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / _  )              San Jose, CA -- June 7, 1993
  / ___/

(_/rime Image has introduced its model Std Con/PCB digital standard coverter
plug-in board for PC operation. The Std Con/PCB may be used with IBM, Amiga,
or any "compatibles" that incorporate an AT bus.

This new plug-in board offers complete world television standards conversion,
including: NTSC, PAL, PAL-M, SECAM, PAL-N, and NTSC 4.43 inputs; and NTSC,
PAL, PAL-M, PAL-N, and NTSC 4.43 outputs.

The Std Con/PCB incorporates an on-board time base corrector/synchronizer in
addition to its standards converter components, and accepts synchronous or
non-synchronous inputs, with transcoding of composite or Y/C in to Y/C or
composite out. Of added significance is the ability of the Std Con/PCB to
convert the NTSC "Toaster" input and output, used extensively in desk-top
video applications, to PAL input and output standards.

The Std Con/PCB provides high quality signal processing generally found in
only much more expensive, rack-mounted models. Weight is under 10 ounces, and
the board requires less than 7 watts of power. The base price for the
stand-alone board is currently under $1,700.00 (US). Options include a remote
control unit for TBC functions, and a 3-way adaptive comb filter that allows
the unit to output broadcast quality flat response to 5.5 MHz. Std Con/PCB
plug-in boards are currently shipping.

that is designed to work with personal computers, including Amiga (Toaster),
IBM PCs and compatibles.

The TCB/PCB accepts and provides required timing for all VCRs (even consumer
models), cameras, and other video feeds used in desk-top video applications.

The unit offers composite and Y/C inputs and outputs, using convenient 4-pin
S-VHS connectors for Y/C. Digital advantages include: no internal alignment
adjustments, no drift operation, and no surface mount ICs to cause
intermittent performance.

In addition to the many features listed, the TCB/PCB is also the smallest
board on the market, operates with the lowest power consumption available (6
watts) to ensure no overheating or power supply problems, and is made in the
U.S.A.

    ___  ___           Impulse Announces Imagine 3.0
   (_  )(  _)          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    / /_/ /          Brooklyn Park, MN -- July 21, 1993
   / __  /
 _/ / / /
(___)(__)ere at Impulse, we are very excited about the release of Imagine
3.0. To say the least it has been a long time since we brought out a new
product, and we are sorry that it has taken so long, but (a big but) we are
sure that the wait will be well worth the time!

If you are on our data base as a registered user you will be getting a
newsletter very soon. We mailed them by US postal service on Monday, July 19,
by bulk mail, so it will take a few days to get to you.

This newsletter will give you an insight to the new features of 3.0 and for
those of you who wish, you will be able to order your copy now. We will begin
to ship the software late in August or early September. There will be a minor
hold up due to the manual. We are very excited to tell you that Phill Shadock
of writing fame will be writing the manual, so you can expect a through
handling of all the old as well as new features.

We are very happy with the new features that are found in Imagine. There are
hundreds of new features, too many to try and mention here, and the
newsletter will do a better job than this note.

One quick note, Imagine has the very best particle system found on any
platform or software! You will have a great time doing snow and rain and
butterflys or swarming rocking chairs.

So to all those who have supported us, we thank you and hope that you will be
as happy with 3.0 as we are.

FINAL NOTE: NOTICE TO ALL DEVELOPERS LARGE OR SMALL or even if you just want
to hack around with that new complier. Impulse wants to make sure that each
of you have all of the data that you need to build support software for
Imagine. If you want to make textures or FX of your own or you want the new
object file format, please note that on your order or call us direct and we
will get you this information as soon as we have finalized everything.

Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to work with Impulse.

Of special note to those who are making products for Imagine, Impulse will be
making a catalog of support products from around the world. You can get your

             Push*Button Publishing Ships Panorama Version 3.0
    ____     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / _  )               Morrison, CO -- July 1993
  / ___/
 / /
(_/ush*Button Publishing has shipped Panorama(TM) Version 3.0, a program for
the creation, manipulation and rendering of fractal landscapes for Amiga
computers. The program incorporates the latest technology in fractal
landscape algorithms, making pictures of astounding beauty and realism from
mathematical calculations.

No knowledge of math is required to use Panorama. The program's automatic,
preset selections for all of its many parameters are configured to produce
nice pictures the first time. From there, users can customize any of the vast
number of possibilities to produce custom effects, refine the realism, add
trees, and sculpt the fractal math algorithms that perform the magic.

In addition to working in the Amiga's normal and overscan resolutions,
Panorama permits creating full, 24-bit pictures of any arbitrary size, shape
or aspect ratio up to 8,000 by 8,000 pixels. Because of this versatility of
both picture size and aspect ratio, Panorama's pictures are suitable for use
in any application on any computer, such as for video backgrounds.

Panorama is Video Toaster friendly, too. The program, which is fully
ARexx-compatible, comes with ARexx macros to support NewTek's Video Toaster,
as well as Impulse's Firecracker-24 24-bit display board.

Panorama supports USGS DEM files with the included GeoRama(TM) program, to
permit rendering of real-world landscapes from Digital Elevation Map files
converted for use by the GeoRama program. The four-disk package includes
three disks of ready-to-render DEM data files, example pictures, settings
files for special effects like volcanic lava, and a collection of ARexx
macros for controlling the program, extracting fractal data for scientific
study, etc.

The program requires 2 megabytes of memory (more recommended), and runs on
AmigaDOS 1.2 and higher, including versions 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0. Hard disk
drive not required, but recommended. Pictures can be saved in standard Amiga
resolutions, including HAM, or in full, 24-bit Amiga IFFs.

Panorama is published for the Amiga by Push*Button Publishing, publisher of
the software packages 600 Amiga Fonts, 600 Color Clipart by Software Designs,
and the book, The Amiga Multimedia Workbook by Jay Gross.

Panorama is available NOW.

Highlights of some important Panorama features:

 o Full 24-bit support, all resolutions
 o Built-in HAM conversion
 o Extensive clouds and sky controls
 o Real water waves on lakes, rivers, or sea
 o Extensively user-controllable blending and dithering on contours and
   cliffs and their boundaries
 o Easy, intuitive user interface
 o Automatic defaults set up to make great pictures
 o Mouse-driven approach to many functions
 o Individually controllable palette for leaves, bark, sky elements, beach,
   waterfalls, rivers, ground cover, etc.
 o ARexx compatibility and controllability, includes ARexx macros for
   automatic interfacing to VideoToaster and FireCracker boards
 o Pictures up to 8000x8000 pixels in any aspect ratio to work with any
   computer system or display
 o GeoRamaTM DEM support program and three disks of DEM files included
 o Maximum control over fractal parameters at all stages of landscape
   creation.

Panorama DEM Data Sets

Render real landscapes from digital elevation data released by the U. S.
Geological Survey and other sources and compressed into a proprietary format
which can be read and converted into Panorama data files by the GeoRama
program provided with Panorama. The data is organized by quadrangles which
are identical to the quadrangles of published USGS contour maps, and are
referred to by the same names. Each of the USGS quadrangles has more than
twice the number of points contained in a Vista Pro landscape file. You can
deal with up to nine contiguous quadrangles at one time in GeoRama, and scale
the patch imported into Panorama to cover a large or small part of this area,
as you wish. The Panorama patch can be centered anywhere in the selected
quadrangles. Focus on exactly the landscape features you wish, and render a
smaller area with maximum detail or a sweeping view of a larger area.

Unlike competing programs, GeoRama and Panorama can adapt to both types of
DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) made available by the USGS, 7.5 minute DEMs
and one degree DEMs.

The points in the 7.5 minute DEMs are spaced by 30 meters in a square array
in what is called the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system.
Each quadrangle spans 7.5 minutes in longitude and 7.5 minutes in lattitude.
Lines of constant longitude and lattitude are curved lines in the UTM
coordinate system (due to  the curvature of the surface of the Earth), so a
quadrangle will look slightly askew when it is displayed in GeoRama.

The points in a one degree DEM are aligned along lines of constant lattitude
and longitude, spaced by 3 seconds of arc in lattitude (N-S) and by 3 or 6
seconds of arc in longitude (E-W). The linear spacing on the ground is about
90 meters N-S and 60 to 90  meters E-W, depending on the lattitude of the
quadrangle. Thus, you cannot hope to see very much fine detail in the shapes
of individual mountains using one-degree DEM  data. However, you can cover a
much larger region than would be feasible with 7.5 minute data, making
possible to render a patch over one hundred kilometers across, spanning an
entire mountain range. The other advantage of the one degree DEMs is that
they are available for the entire United States, including the spectacular
mountains of Alaska, while the 7.5-minute DEMs have much more spotty
coverage.

The DEM data for Panorama is sold in sets of 2 to 6 disks, each disk
containing from 5 to 8 or more quadrangles. Each quadrangle contains data for
roughly 160000 points, but the size of the file varies according to the
ruggedness of the terrain, and quadrangles containing large areas with the
same elevation, such as lakes or the sea, take relatively little space.
Normally each set will contain contiguous quadrangles, but some sets contain
two or more smaller blocks of data. The one degree DEM files are about 10
megabytes in size as they come from the USGS, but they are broken into 9 or 6
subquadrangles for distribution, and the compressed file sizes are in the
same range as for the 7.5 minute DEMs, about 100 to 170 kilobytes.

The names of the 7.5 minute files are the same, except for perhaps some
abbreviation, as those of the corresponding USGS quadrangles. The
subquadrangles of the one degree quadrangles are given the name of the one
degree quadrangle followed by two numbers indicating the position of the
subquadrangle within the quadrangle. The first digit is the west-to-east
position, and the second indicates the south-to-north position, with 00
indicating the subquadrangle in the southwest corner of the quadrangle.  All
DEM files have a ".dem" extension. They are not compatible with Vista Pro or
Scenery Animator dem files.

Each disk will contain a ".doc" file giving some information about prominent
features of the area covered, and a diagram indicating the relative positions
of the quadrangles and the names of some of the adjacent quadrangles. Also,
there will be one or more ".DEMset" files which can be used when saving a
Panorama data file from GeoRama to set up the rendering parameters in the
data file appropriately. See the Panorama manual for the details.
