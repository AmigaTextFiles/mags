            Creative Focus Ships New Amiga DeskJet Printer Driver
 ______     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(__  __)           Chenango Bridge, NY -- February 1993
  / /
 / /
(_/he Creative Focus Super_DJC2 printer driver is for all Amiga computers and
for all Hewett-Packard DeskJets, including the new 550C. It provides better
control over printing tasks than software costing many times more. While the
intuitive side of your brain is admiring the pictures [Note: great color
pirnt-outs shown on the flyer], here are some numbers for the analytic side:

 o  4 selectable lightness/darkness levels
 o  4 types of black (three composites plus true black)
 o  3 shingling options (to control ink bleeding)
 o  2 depletion choices (or reducing the amount of ink)

For text output you get 14 powerful extended commands for just about
everything: character set, pitch, point, typeface and softfont selection;
control over lines per inch, linewrap, textscale and print direction; 8
different text color options; relative and absolute row and column cursor
positioning; and tabsize determination.

Want to get at those internal fonts? Super_DJC2 provides Preferences and
Printer access to all the typefaces: Courier, Letter Gothic, CG Times and
Univers. Choose between letter, legal, A4 and envelope paper sizes, and stack
envelopes with the new 550C. For help with specific software packages, you
can turn off performation skip, suppress unwanted pagefeeds, disable the
driver's color correction, or select typefaces and character sets via font
numbers.

Super_DJC2 works with all Amigas, and is compatible with AmigaDOS releases
1.3 through 3.0. And it's for all DeskJets: even with the Original and the
new Portable your grayscale images will be exceptional and your text control
unsurpassed.

One more number: Super_DJC2 is available from Creative Focus for $50.00.
However, until April 15, 1993, it will be available at a special introductory
price of $35.00, which is a 30% discount. Super_DJC owers can upgrade for
$15.00; owners of DJHelper, Super_DJ and Super_DJ V2.0 can upgrade for
$25.00. You must enclose your original disk and include shipping handling of
$2.00 within the US, elsewhere $4.00. Send cash, check or money order, and
allow 2-3 weeks for delivery.

(_/  \/  \_)icroMiga, known best as a mail order vendor specializing in the
Amiga line of personal computers since 1988 is announcing today we will start
publishing a new Amiga specific magazine. The first issue is scheduled for
May of this year and subsequent issues will be released quarterly.

This new magazine titled "Amiga Explorer" will focus on the Amiga
marketplace, spending most of its pages on what's available and new to the
Amiga community. It will have indepth reviews of software and hardware,
columns on how best to use your Amiga and the software you purchase. Several
technical articles covering C programming  and ARexx are also planned.

We will also be spending a great deal of time "Exploring" the online
community including commercial online services, BBS's and Shareware/Public
Domain Software. Included in every issue will be several "Spotlight" articles
where we will do in depth reviews of Shareware software, interviews with the
developers and also spotlight different BBS's around the country.

Just like every other magazine, we will have the usual reviews of all the
popular hardware and software plus the usual new products listings. What will
be different is our commitment to the shareware and telecomputing public.

In the weeks to come we will release an outline of the planned articles for
1993 and into 1994. In this outline we will discuss in great detail the
direction we plan to take Amiga Explorer and we hope you will take the time
in the next few weeks to contact us with your ideas, suggestions or
submissions.

Amiga Explorer will be your magazine, it will be completely designed from the
ground up based on your input. If you want something or don't like something
let us know. We will be available to you via several online systems including
Internet/Usenet.

Our columns and reviews will be written by people like yourself, people you
know, people you correspond with right here on the net. In other words,
people who know what the Amiga is all about.

The first issue will be available to all those who ask free of charge, simply
write us at the address below to request your free issue. Future issues will
be available for only the cost of mailing, or ask your local dealer to carry
it free of charge.

Much help is needed in the development of Amiga Explorer. If you are
interested in helping out, please contact us at the address below.

MicroMiga will no longer be doing any mail order sales, instead focusing all
available resources on the publication.

For more information contact John Ferguson, MicroMiga General Manager Editor
Amiga Explorer at P.O. Box 1898, Spring Valley, CA 91979-1898, telephone
619/670-3151 or fax 619/670-9732.

                          MicroBotics 12 A'Clock
            Realtime Clock/Calendar Expansion for the New Amiga 1200
 ______     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(__  __)             Richardson, Texas -- January 1993
  / /
 / /
(_/he Amiga 1200 computer is just about the perfect Amiga -- except for one
thing: It really needs a clock. Now you can easily and inexpensively have one
by installing the MicroBotics 12 A'Clock board internally on the clock-header
connector on the 1200 motherboard. The 12 A'Clock is a simple-to-use
peripheral that can automatically set your Amiga's system time and date upon
startup.

12 A'Clock Specifications

Target System: Amiga 1200 Personal Computer.

Installation: Internal to Amiga 1200; resides on the 40-pin clock header
connector on the motherborad. User or dealer installable. Does not interfere
with installation of other peripherals on the 150-pin edge card.

Compatibility: Designed for general compatibility with all Amiga system
software including AmigaDOS system 3.0 and later versions. Uses the AmigaDOS
Date and SetClock commands transparently. No additional software required.

Realtime Clock Calendar Hardware: An Epson RTC 72421B clock/calendar backed
by a long lasting, user replacable lithium battery cell (CR 2032) is
supported.

Applications: Provides date and time for file date stamping and "alarm"
functions. Very useful in a hard-disk environment to insure proper date and
time setting.

Power Consumption: 10 microamps (standby). Effectively, "no power" is used.

Product Availability: Worldwide distribution via Amiga dealers and
distributors.

USA Suggested Retail Price: $34.95 with clock and lithium battery. Actual
selling price determined by dealer.

          MicroBotics' MBX 1200z and the A1200 -- A Winning Combo!
    ____  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / ___)           Richardson, Texas -- January 1993
  / /
 / (__
(_____)ommodore's most recent introduction, the hot, new Amiga 1200, can be
made even hotter by adding the easy-to-install MBX 1200z floating
point/FastRAM expansion product from MicroBotics, Inc. You definitely want to
have an MBX 1200z installed on any Amiga 1200 since the perceived performance
increase is DRAMATIC.

The Word on The Amiga 1200

This machine, recently introduced at World of Commodore shows and COMDEX, is
what we've all been waiting for in the Amiga market: A Clear Winner! With its
advanced AGA chipset, 14MHz EC020 processor, and advanced system software
(AmigaDOS 3.0) it will surely be a marketplace winner. The A1200 may resemble
the A600 externally, but under its skin, the A1200 is far superior in
performance and capability. Best of all, from our point of view, the A1200 is
seriously expandable. In about the same location as the A501 "bay" on an
A500, the A1200 has a 150-pin, 32-bit wide expansion bus running at full
processor speed. This expansion port is MUCH better than that on the A500 or
A600. It is also a much better expansion port than the PCMCIA slot (common to
both the A600 and A1200).

The Word on Our MBX 1200z

Installed on the 150-pin expansion port, the MBX 1200z makes the very nice
A1200 a true "power user" machine, strong enough for ray-tracing, morphing,
desktop publishing, animation and heavy-duty game playing/flight simulator
use. MBX 1200z's 68881 Math Coprocessor fantastically improves floating point
calculations and its 32-bit wide memory capability greatly enhances general
operations. With an MBX 1200z installed, the already fast A1200 can have its
basic speed almost DOUBLED! And system speed for floating point math
increases by a factor of SIXTEEN!

The Word on PCMCIA RAM vs. MBX 1200z RAM

The word on PCMCIA memory is "Big Loser!" It runs at LESS THAN ONE-FOURTH the
speed of MBX 1200z RAM! Amazing but true, PCMCIA memory is dog-slow compared
to the rocket of MBX-style FastRAM. Why?

 o  MBX 1200z RAM is twice as wide (32-bit wide vs. 16-bits wide for
    PCMCIA).

 o  MBX 1200z RAM does memory transfers at NINETEEN MEGABYTES per second!
    PCMCIA can only manage 3.56 megabytes per second.

You definitely do NOT want to cripple your system with PCMCIA memory (see the
table of benchmarks below). In addition to speed, MBX 1200z can provide a RAM
space TWICE the size of PCMCIA (a full eight megabytes rather than just
four). And, MBX 1200z is cheaper per megabyte! It can use exactly the same
SIMM module as used in the new Amiga 4000 introduced earlier in 1992. You'll
also be glad to hear that the SIMM module on MBX 1200z is easily installed or
upgraded; we have used super-high quality, easy-to-manage metal-latched SIMM
connectors. No more broken plastic latches or hard to insert SIMMs.

The Last Word

The Amiga 1200 has been shipped in Europe and Canada and is now available in
the USA as well. MBX 1200z is shipping now, and it's selling as fast as it
ships. Early supplies are limited so order now. MBX 1200z is the FIRST
A1200-specific expansion product available from anyone! Be sure to get it
now!

  ____    Soft-Logik HotLinks Developers Kit & Font/Clip Art Sale
 / ___)   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
( (__                St. Louis, MO -- January 1993
 \__ \
 ___) )
(____/oft-Logik announces that the second edition of our HotLinks developer
kit is available now. This devkit is actually usable, readable, and provides
useful information. (As compared to the previous devkit which probably scared
most people when they first received it.)

The new devkit discusses why you would want to implement HotLinks, the
HotLinks system (non-technical discussion), implementation issues
(subscriber, publisher and publisher/subscriber applications, linking
options, etc.) and a lot more. The technical side of the kit is now easy to
use since it presented in the same format as Commodore documentation.

Developers kits are available on request, by sending GE Mail to Soft-Logik
Development SL-TECH or by phone at 314/894-8608. We will post an updated
version of the online kit, but it's not ready yet. In any case, the printed
kit is preferable.

There is no charge, obligation or non-disclosure for the devkit. You can add
HotLinks to any program (PD, shareware, or commercial) without charge.
