(_/hey're ready! Bill Graham's Tonguemonster T-Shirts in full 24-bit color!
Done with the new Canon lasergraphic process that makes silkscreening
obsolete, the resolution of the image is actually tighter than the weave of
the shirt! The image on the shirt is almost identical to StarShip Library
file number 16806 -- a crazy bunch of neon-colored howling Tonguemonsters!
The major difference is the addition of a border around the image, which is
about 11x17 inches. There isn't any pixelization due to the fact that the
image was scanned from a color print. The original image was used in making
the print was rendered at 1000x600 resolution.

Bill has one, a test run, and says it's COOL! They are white and come in
small, medium, large, and extra large. Price is $15.95 plus $4.50 shipping &
handling, for a total of $20.45. To order, send a check or money order to:

                         A Jerk Novelty Company
                         2209 E. Karen Dr.
                         Phoenix, AZ 85022

Specify size when ordering. The artist only gets a tiny cut, but something is
better than nothing.

Bill is in the process of designing new Tonguemonsters in various
configurations for a new batch of T-shirts. "We will see," he says. "I am
trying to get other critters printed on T-shirts such as Batworm,
Spacecheezeburger, Wormball, and I was even going to dig up Captain Ned. All
of this is dependent on initial sales, however. These 'A Jerk Novelty
Company' guys are not lightweights; some of their clients include the state
of Texas, Porsche, and Walt Disney. So hopefully, we will soon see Amiga
based art all over the torsos of America!"

              Terminus Released by Jack Radigan of JRComm Fame
 ______       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(__  __)          *StarShip* News Network -- July 6, 1993
  / /
 / /
(_/wo years in the making, Jack Radigan (author of the highly successful
Amiga communications program JRComm) has just released a shareware evaluation
version of Terminus 2.0, originally slated as an upgrade to JRComm but far
superior, which is compatible with AmigaDOS 1.3 and up.

Terminus -- which looks to be as feature-packed and elegant as hoped -- is
now available for downloading from the *StarShip* Library in file 20066
TRMS20.LZH. And MR.LGB has written the first publically available scripts for
Terminus in file 20094 SCRIPTS.LHA. These scripts will help you get on and
off GEnie more quickly; one retrieves GE Mail while the other grabs a list of
new uploads from the *StarShip* Library. We're sure you'll be seeing many
more helpful Terminus accessories files in the Library shortly.

Unlike many shareware products, Terminus comes with an extensive 216 page
user manual formatted for printing on either dot-matrix or laser printers. It
is easily as complete and well-organized as the documentation accompanying
most commercial products.

And if that's not enough, Jack Radigan himself (assisted by any number of
experienced *StarShip* members) is directly available for assistance in
configuring and using Terminus' many valuable features in *StarShip* Bulletin
Board CATegory 10, Topic 28.

Here, taken directly from the program's documentation, is a list of Terminus'
primary features:


Terminus 2.0 Users Manual               Electronic Edition

Welcome to Terminus 2.0, a highly capable and flexible, if not seasoned
telecommunications tool for the Amiga personal computer system. Terminus is a
completely rewritten replacement for JR-Comm 1.02a. It is not an update.

Initially, JR-Comm was going to be updated as scheduled to include XPR and
ARexx support. But, quite frankly, JR-Comm's major limitation was that it
lacked the proper design to add new features easily. With the release of
AmigaDOS 2.04 it became apparent that a complete rewrite was the only
solution. As a result, Terminus is essentially a second generation product,
hence the 2.0 version number.

Terminus also conforms, where possible, to the recommendations outlined in
the "Commodore Amiga Style Guide" for Release 2 of the Amiga operating system
while still retaining compatibility with the 1.3 release. However, all future
releases of Terminus will be compatible with the 2.0 (or later) operating
system release only.


     FEATURES OVERVIEW
     -----------------
     The following are the major features present in Terminus 2.0.

      -    Reentrant program design for multiple sessions using one
           copy of program code in ram.

      -    All internal functions multitask.

      -    Can be iconified.

      -    The entire program is keyboard navigable.

      -    Comprehensive script language implemented as a small BASIC
           interpreter.

      -    Automated script record feature to create login scripts.

      -    ARexx and XPR support.

      -    Display system uses custom scroll routines for fast scroll
           rates and interleaved bitmaps to eliminate flicker during
           scrolling without the need for a 68020 or higher cpu.

      -    TTY, AMIGA, IBM COLOR/MONO, VT52, VT102 AND VT220 terminal
           emulations.  All emulations are as complete and as accurate
           as possible.

      -    Console definition files to easily change Terminus between
           different terminal configurations.

      -    XMODEM, XMODEM-CRC, XMODEM-1k, YMODEM, YMODEM-1k, YMODEM-g
           and ZMODEM file transfer protocols included internally for
           fast throughput rates. XPR support for other less used
           protocols.

      -    Windowed review buffer that uses the Boyer-Moore search
           algorithm for fast location of text within the buffer space.
           Can also load files directly into the buffer with dynamic
           buffer resizing as required.

      -    Clipboard support for snipping text from the review buffer
           or main terminal display.  Options to send either raw or
           quoted text from the clipboard out the serial port.

      -    Multiline chat area with configurable height and history
           buffer.

      -    Superb XON/XOFF flow control with status line indicator and
           immediate text display stop/start via keyboard control.

      -    Support for DMA and programmed I/O hard disk controllers
           that have problems with downloads using high speed modems.

      -    ChipMiser option for systems with limited chip ram space.

      -    Dynamically buffered printer support so that the terminal is
           never I/O bound due to slow printer output.

      -    Hexadecimal display mode with output that is compatible with
           both the review buffer and capture files.

      _    Integral remote CLI/Shell feature.

      -    Phonebook entry support for multiple number systems with up
           to 4 numbers per entry.

      -    All defaults, phonebook, console definition and script files
           are ASCII compatible for editing with your favorite text
           editor.

      -    Full support for OwnDevUnit.library is also included.


     MISSING FEATURES
     ----------------
     There were some changes that resulted in the removal of four major
     items previously available in JR-Comm. They were the internal file
     requester, CIS B+ and WXMODEM file transfer protocols and the Skypix
     terminal emulation.

     The file requester was removed in favor of using the file and font
     requesters that the asl.library and req.library provide. Although the
     ability to select files across multiple devices/volumes/directories is
     not currently supported by these two requesters, there is a new menu
     item in Terminus that allows you to add file selections to the
     selected list. One of these file requesters must be present in the
     LIBS: directory of your system in order to use Terminus.

     An external CIS B+ XPR module is provided with the Terminus
     distribution disk. The internal implementation of this protocol was
     deleted since it can only be used with the Compuserve Information
     System.

     WXMODEM was removed because it was rarely, if ever, used outside the
     now defunct PeopleLink service.

     The Skypix emulation no longer exists due to the scheduled release of
     a new version of the Skyline BBS that will provide a new graphics
     protocol. It was not known during the redesign of the display system
     if the original protocol would be supported so the irrevocable
     decision to remove it was made. A future version of Terminus is
     slated to provide a graphics protocol that will have its capabilities
     publically documented for use by any BBS system operator.


Although the version of Terminus in file 20066 is fully functional, shareware
registration is only $40 for a single user site license, and registered
owners of JRComm can upgrade to Terminus for $10. The *StarShip* urges you to
support the fine shareware authors who release products for the Amiga! One of
the best around is Jack Radigan.

               PC-Tumor Amiga BBS offers JPEG Medical Images
    ____       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / _  )         *StarShip* News Network -- July 5, 1993
  / ___/

(_/C-Tumor, we believe, is the first BBS of digitized images of human
neoplasias (cancers). There are over 200 digitized images primarily color
microscopic images from various tissues and organ sites. So far all have been
digitized using Amiga computers by three experienced Board Certified
pathologists: Drs. John Minarcik, Peter Shireman and Mariano Alvira.
Digitized images are all compressed using the JPEG "lossy compression"
routines so they can easily been accessed and viewed by multiple computer
platforms. Uploading of images is encouraged providing that you use the
Zmodem protocol and they are "JPGED". The Sysop, Dr. John Minarcik, reviews
all uploads and supervises the quality of the material. We hope that PC-Tumor
will contribute to the dissemination of professionally produced color digital
images of human cancers, a difficult and expensive task to do in routine
printed publications, and will contribute to the advancement and knowledge of
human cancers.

BASIC INFORMATION FOR NEW USERS

Welcome to PC-Tumor!. If you are an experienced BBSer, you probably don't
need to read any further.

Here are a few tips to help you move around better on PC-Tumor.

1) Read all screen prompts CAREFULLY. All of the instructions for using
PC-Tumor to the max are laid out right before your eyes. Just read carefully
what command to use and enter it precisely as directed.

2) No matter what computer you are using, you can download and view these
images, but you best remember:

A) You must use the ZMODEM protocol for all downloads.

B) Your software (and hardware) must be able to decompress and view .jpg
image files. Browse through conference #2 and download JPG2GIF.EXE and
MVGAVU60.ZIP and PKZ100.EXE. These may be helpful for most IBM's with VGA or
better graphics.

C) PC-Tumor uses the fastest modem available, a US Robotics 16.8 Dual
Standard. It should be compatible with any other type of modem, and transfer
rates over 5400 cps have been possible on some textfiles, which approaches
57,600 baud (slightly faster than the speed of light!!!). The modem will slow
down to keep up with your modem however.

D) Our current hardware is Amiga based. Although our Mac and IBM friends tell
us they get great images on their home systems as well, the best "near
photographic quality" images we have seen are on our own home or office based
systems. The quality of images you get will depend on: a) Your hardware
(special graphics boards are NOT needed usually, if you have VGA systems). b)
Your software and how you "tweak" it. c) A lot of other variables. d) Luck.
We do not recommend anything unless asked.

E) Please UPLOAD images too, if possible. PC-Tumor is dying to get images
better than the ones we put up.

F) What is JPEG?

JPEG or .JPG files, short for Joint Photographic Expert Group, is THE major
format for image compression. Typically, a 1000K (or one Megabyte)
near-photographic quality, "true" color (or 24-bit color), image, can be
compressed to a mere fraction of its original memory requirements. Our JPEG's
are typically around 30K which means at 2400 baud, you can download an image
in about 2-3 minutes. If you have a high speed modem, the same transfer would
take just a few seconds.

G) The main purpose of PC-Tumor BBS is to educate users on the appearance of
tumors. It is also, however, a message base for anything you want to talk
about, a workshop dedicated to improving the quality of digital diagnostic
medical images, and a tool for diagnostic physicians to transfer images to
other physicians around the planet for "stat" consultations and second
opinions, without having to wait for the US Postal Service or Federal
Express. For us, PC-Tumor has been a lot of fun!

H) Browse through Conference #1 to see what tumors we have. Browse through
Conference #2 to see gadgets and info.

                           Blitz2 BASIC Availble
    ____                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / _  )               Madison, WI -- July 9, 1993
  / __ /
 / _  )
(____/litz2 is a BASIC programming language is fast becoming _the_ BASIC
programming language on the Amiga. It can be used to program any type of
software, from valuable applications to entertaining arcade games.

Blitz2 is a compiler, it takes BASIC code and creates very fast, compact,
standalone programs. Programs that most people will think you created in
machine code or C.

Blitz2 is a next generation BASIC with features borrowed from PASCAL, C and
others. Blitz2 has given BASIC, the friendliest programming language of all
times, a new lease of life with more power than ever before.

Features

Full implementation of extended BASIC (Select..Case While..wend etc.)
Support for standard IFF graphics, sound and animations
NewTypes similar to C Structures making Blitz2 more than just another BASIC
In-line macro assembler for advanced users
Linked list support for quick database type programming
Standard Amiga screen, window, menu  & gadget management commands
Full access to the internal Amiga libraries and structures
Power-Windows type user interface generator
Extended Workbench 2.0/3.0 support including AGA palette control
Super fast Blitz-mode operation which "cleanly" takes over the Amiga OS
6 different Blitting commands for ultra fast, smooth graphics
Extensive display control for smooth scrolling, dual playfield etc.
Produces 100% machine code (fast and compact) programs

What you get

Blitz2 ships with 2 manuals. The reference manual is a large 320 page A4 book
detailing the Blitz2 command set with example code for most of the 300+
commands and functions. The User Guide is a smaller book containing a step by
step guide to getting started in Blitz2 as well as indepth discussions and
tutorials introducing the many facets of programming in Blitz2 including many
type in programs.

The disks contain not only the Blitz2 compiler program and editor but heaps
of examples, utilities, games and extra documentation.

Also included with Blitz2 is a free issue of the BlitzUser magazine.

Blitz User Magazine

Blitz User is currently a quarterly publication that includes both a printed
magazine and disk. Each issue is jam packed with upgrades, bug fixes, new
commands, tutorials etc.

As Blitz2 is continually being expanded both in versatility and ease of use,
a subscription to Blitz User Magazine will keep you up to date with the
fastest growing language on the Amiga.

Here's a list of updates from the first 4 issues of Blitz User Magazine

Issue 1:
Tutorials on using Intuitools, ShapesMaker and the MapEditor as well as
serial port and speech control. Also listing for the BuzzBar game.

Issue 2:
Includes new commands for DPaint anims, adding Arexx ports to your Blitz2
programs, octamed support as well as heaps of program listings etc.

Issue 3:
Ted is given a major revamp and a powerful runtime debugger is added to
Blitz2.

Issue 4:
Cycling gadgets, radio buttons, AGA screens, polygon commands and heaps of
other new goodies.

What the Amiga Magazines say:

CU AMIGA
Giving Blitz2 an overall 88%, CU Amiga summed up Blitz2 with the following
conclusion:

If you want to know exactly what makes the Amiga tick without having to buy
15 manuals and learn assembler and C there is no better way. You can write
whatever sort of program you want, be it a demo, a game, or a piece of
applications software.

The only drawbacks are those of the Amiga and the BASIC language itself. If
you want a program to do something bad enough, you'll find a way with Blitz
BASIC. It's ideal for beginneres and experts alike and whats more it produces
true Amiga software. Get it!

               Colorado Company Intros PCMCIA-based Products
    ____       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / ___)             Colorado, U.S.A., July 2, 1993

(_____)olorado Springs, Colorado-based TWD Electronics Inc has introduced the
latest addition to its line of PCMCIA-based products, the PCMCIA SCSI-2
adapter card Model 2001.

The company says the new external adapter card connects to the PCMCIA Type II
slot available in many newer laptop and notebook computers to provide users a
low cost method of transferring data between portable computers, desktop
workstations, and SCSI-compatible peripherals.

According to John Brown, founder and president of TWD, laptop users can
quickly connect to hard disk drives, CD-ROM drives, tape drives,
communications devices, multimedia devices, and other peripherals.

Brown has considerable experience in the electronics industry and says he
recognizes the need for a general purpose expansion bus. He was involved in
the product launch of NCR's 53C810 PCI/SCSI processor when he was product
manager for high end SCSI controller chips with that company's
Microelectronics Division.

The Model 2001 supports eight-bit transfers of up to 3 megabytes per second
on the SCSI bus with concurrent 16-bit transfers on the PCMCIA bus. The
standard DOS 5.0 and higher drivers supplied with the Model 2001 adhere to
standard CAM architecture guidelines, says the company. SCSI terminators,
included on the adapter card, can be disabled using the software, and a sleep
mode is provided to reduce power consumption when the system is not active.

TWD says the Model 2001 is available individually or as a system that
includes the interconnecting cable, device drivers shipped on a 1.44 MB
floppy disk, and a user manual. Pricing starts at $225 for the adapter card
only and $285 for the complete system. Evaluation units are already
available, and the company says it expects to ship production quantities in
the fourth quarter.

             Federation II Front End Program Available for Amiga
 _        _  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
( \  /\  / )          Federation Space -- July 7, 1993
 \ \/  \/ /
  \      /
   \_/\_/e are delighted to announce that Federation, the adult space fantasy
multi-player game on GEnie, now has a front-end terminal program for the
Amiga, as well as the PC version which has been available for some months.

FedTerm has many features designed to enhance your gameplay. (Features differ
slightly between formats.) Scrollback allows you to look back through the
text buffer, while still receiving the game's output. Output can be saved to
disk, or sent directly to a printer.

You can direct different kinds of text sent by the game to separate windows,
or display it in another colour - for example, when spying on another player,
or when receiving trading prices from an exchange. Trading prices can also be
accompanied by icons of the commodity.

Your persona's stats and ship's status are displayed in a bar graph, which is
updated every time new information is received from the game. The risk of
running out of fuel in space is no more, provided you keep an eye on the
display! You can also see at a glance if your character needs to visit a bar
for some food.

The multimedia aspects of FedTerm let you display pictures and play sounds -
you specify how they will be displayed, and which word received from the game
will trigger them.

You can exchange picture and sound files with other players, and key them to
their persona - so when your friend says "Hi" your computer plays a sample of
their voice saying "Hi", and displays their picture.

FedTerm has programmable function-keys, and a fully-featured scripting
language.

FedTerm can be downloaded from the Federation Library on GEnie Page 220
(option 3, so the library can be used by Aladdin). The main FedTerm file
contains a text manual explaining how the program works, and a small
selection of pictures and sounds. We will be uploading more pictures and
sounds over the next few days, and of course the Fed players will be
uploading their own!
