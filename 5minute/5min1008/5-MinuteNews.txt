                  DeluxeMusic II and One-Stop Music Shop
                              Installation Tip

   / /
 _/ / t appears that the new DeluxeMusic II is already arriving at the
(____)homes of the eager Amiga musicians who pre-ordered it.  And if you are
one of the folks who have Blue Ribbon's One-Stop Music Shop card, you're
probably STILL rifling through the pages of the new DeluxeMusic manual to
find out how in the world to install it.  You THOUGHT you did everything
correctly when you installed the program and selected "One-Stop", didn't
you?

Relax, you didn't forget a thing, and the new DeluxeMusic II from Electronic
Arts *does* work directly with the terrific sound card, without ever tying
up your serial port with MIDI!  All you need to do is get your Midi Setup
edited and saved.

On your main DMusic screen, the menu selections to the far right, SETTINGS,
there is a MIDI SETUP listed there.  Select this.

Edit the Output Link to read "out.1" and the Input Link to "in.1"

Now, exit the setup requester and save your settings.  Voila!  Your brand
new DeluxeMusic II will now know how to 'talk' to your One-Stop Music Shop!
A warm "Thanks" to Howard Wooten for remembering how to do this in his
reply in the Deluxe Music II Topic of the *StarShip* Bulletin Board.

Don't miss Thursday Night's Deluxe Music conference this week for Amiga
musicians.

   / /
 _/ /
(____)f you've been hoping to learn ARexx programming, but haven't had the
time, this may be your chance. GEnie will offer a class on ARexx during the
1993 fall term at CALC. The author of ARexxGuide will offer classroom
guidance and individual help to students.

The shareware fee for ARexxGuide will be waived for those who register for
the fall course.

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Title: INTRODUCTION TO REXX/AREXX PROGRAMMING
Section Number: CSE 318

Students in this course will learn the fundamentals of the REXX
programming/macro language which was developed for IBM mainframes and is now
available for several desktop computers, notably PCs running OS/2 and the
Amiga on which ARexx is included as part of the operating system (2.0 and
higher).

We'll look at the general format of a REXX program including the types of
statements and control structures; variables, expressions, and functions; at
using external libraries to extend the powers of REXX; and at the basic
tools to use REXX as an 'interprocess' medium to extend the functionality of
REXX-savvy programs.

By the end of this course, the student should be able to build useful
standalone programs using REXX and have a general understanding of how to
use REXX as a powerful macro language with other programs.

Although this course will focus on use of ARexx on the Amiga, its lessons
will also be useful those who wish to learn how REXX functions on other
platforms, including OS/2.

The student is expected to have a REXX interpreter or compiler and
ARexxGuide or another manual which includes a complete description of
instructions and built-in function calls. No other textbook is required.

Course Registration Fee: $55
8 weeks
Instructor: Robin Evans (R.EVANS6)
Course Meets: Sundays 9-11pm Eastern
First Class:  October 10


How to Register for Robin's Class:

                       DUNE II's Amiga Programmer

   \/ irgin Games has recently released Dune II: The Bulding of a Dynasty
for the Amiga to rave reviews in both Europe and North America. Westwood
Studios, the company who developed "The Legend of Kyrandia", has produced a
"Sim-City meets the military" game based on Frank Herbert's novels for this
intriguing game release.

DUNE II sounds like it should be the sequel to the hit game, Dune (developed
by Cryo), but it is completely different.  The first Dune was an adventure
based on the movie.  The main point of Dune II is strategy.  Yours.  It will
thrill all the fans who read and loved the DUNE Novels, and perhaps even
dared to dream of living on Dune.

Peteroo's guest on Sunday night will be Bob Koon, the lead programmer for
porting DUNE II from the IBM PC to the Amiga and the support programmer for
the Amiga version of The Legend of Kyrandia.  Come and talk to him about
what it's like to "Amigatize" a hit game like this - and find out all the
ins and outs of DUNE II.  Peter Olafson and Bob will be waiting to meet you
at 10 PM Eastern Sunday.

(____)very night of the week, someone's talking Amiga in the *StarShip*
conference.  Beginning at 9 PM Eastern with the *StarShip* HelpDesk, and
ending well after midnight, Amiga owners are finding answers to their
questions, then sticking around for subjects near and dear to their heart,
and making new friends as they help even MORE people at the late HelpDesk.

You'll note we've got a great guest this week, and timely subjects for you
to discuss at 10 PM Eastern each night.

Music fans should note the change to Thursday Nights, and Video and
Multimedia fans should note the change to Tuesday Nights.  We've asked Mike
Holda, MIKE.AA, if he'll host the much requested Aladdin Night once a
month, and he's agreed, so you'll see him this week on Monday night - ready
to answer you Aladdin questions, and he'll be BACK for more next month!


Whatta guy!

 \ \/ /
  \  /
  / /ou read the rave reviews from the World of Commodore show in Pasadena
 (_/ now read all the specs on the much-touted new Soft-Logik products
coming our way.

A Soft-Logik spokesperson today confirmed to the *StarShip* 5-MINUTE News
that Typesmith 2.0 should be shipping within two weeks.  They are waiting
for the manual to come back from the printers, our reporter was told.
PageStream 3.0 will ship mid November.




  ____              Soft-Logik Announces TypeSmith 2.0!
 / ___)             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 \__ \
 ___) )
(____/ oft-Logik Publishing Corp. today announced TypeSmith 2.0, a
completely new version of the Amiga outline font editor.

TypeSmith 1.0 was introduced in early 1993. With the phenomenal response we
received, we decided to bring a newer version out right away.  TypeSmith 2.0
is a must-have program for all desktop publishing users.

TypeSmith 2.0 can load, save, edit and generate bitmap screen fonts. For the
first time, users can create bitmap fonts from scratch manually or choose
Generate Bitmap to automatically create a bitmap version of an existing
outline font. Bitmap font support is a great way to improve outline font
display speed.

Bitmap font support alone makes TypeSmith 2.0 an indispensable program, but
it also includes hinting.  Hints make fonts look better at low resolution
and at smaller sizes. TypeSmith 2 loads hints in fonts create by other
programs, and will save them without changing them. It can also generate
hints for new or modified fonts, and can convert PostScript hints to the
Intellifont format.

TypeSmith 2.0 offers the ability to trace a picture automatically. Just load
a picture and choose the Autotrace command. This is great for scanning
characters.

TypeSmith 2.0 is available now for sale worldwide for $199.95. Customers who
purchase a full copy of TypeSmith 1.0 after August 15, 1993, are eligible
for a free upgrade to version 2.0 by mailing their registration card, proof
of purchase and $5 for shipping and handling to Soft-Logik.  Previous
purchasers can upgrade for $50 plus shipping and handling.

      "PageStream 3.0 will change the way you think about publishing"



  ____   Soft-Logik Presents An In-Depth Preview Of PageStream 3.0!
 / ___)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
( (__              St. Louis, Missouri -- September 1993
 \__ \
 ___) )
(____/ oft-Logik Publishing Corporation will present an in-depth preview of
PageStream 3.0.  PageStream 3 is a completely new version of the #1 desktop
publishing program. Adding a comprehensive list of features that users have
requested, PageStream 3 surpasses its competition.

PageStream 3 is the ideal program for any desktop publishing project. It can
be used to write letters, produce high-end color separations and publish
complex books with multiple sections and chapters. The new trapping and
plate control features makes PageStream 3.0 a leader in the emerging
pre-press field.

PageStream 3 breaks new ground with a dual paragraph and character style
system that allows style override, style ripple and object styles. The new
style system makes applying attributes to text and objects easier than ever
before.  PageStreams flexible toolbox allows users to choose between small,
large, vertical and horizontal toolbox layouts. There are even floating
panels for fonts, colors, styles, macros and pages to make editing easier.

PageStream 3 offers an incredible array of document formatting features.
Auto-kerning and auto-hyphenation have been added, and text styles are
configurable, including changing the shadow type and offset, and the
underline method. The tab feature allows left/center/right alignment on any
character, and dot leaders (filled tabs) can be made with any character.

PageStream 3.0 now supports the PANTONE Color System. PageStream 3.0 uses
this industry standard to provide printed color accuracy with guaranteed
results.  In addition to PANTONE support, PageStream 3.0 offers support for
spot and process color, and CMYK, HSV, and RGB color models.

PageStream has always been the import format champion with numerous formats
supported. Import a Word Perfect file and export a Final Copy document. Or
import an IFF ILBM and export it as TIFF. Import an Adobe Illustrator 3.0
EPS file, interpret it into a structured drawing, and dissolve it into
component shapes and paths.

And the newly added format of translating Professional Page documents. Users
of Gold Disks Professional Page desktop publishing program can now make the
transition to PageStream painlessly. Converting a Professional Page document
for use in PageStream is a simple task.

PageStream 3 adds the power of ARexx without adding the complexity. ARexx
scripts can be written from scratch or recorded within the program. Scripts
can then be played back, without knowledge of ARexx programming. PageStream
3 features are an extensive ARexx command set that will satisfy any
power-user.

The PageStream 3.0 publishing system comes with the PageLiner 2.0 text
editor and the BME 2.0 bitmap editor. These programs are linked to
PageStream with the included HotLinks 2.0, the Amiga data exchange standard.

PageStream 3.0 will be available in early fall for $395. Customer who
purchase a full copy of PageStream 2.2 after March 15, 1993, are eligible
for a free upgrade to version 3.0 by mailing their registration card, proof
of purchase and $5 for shipping and handling, to Soft-Logik. Previous
purchasers can upgrade for $125 if they own PageStream 2.0 or higher, or for
only $95 if they also own HotLinks Editions. Professional Page owners can
upgrade to PageStream for $175. (limited time offer)

PageStream 3.0 will change the way you think about publishing.

(______/ evWare, Inc., the California-based direct marketer and distributor
of software and videotapes for the Amiga, announced that it has released the
latest version of OctaMED Professional, the world's best-selling music and
sound sequencer for the Amiga.

Version 5 of OctaMED Professional will sell for $69.95 and offers users new
features and significant improvements from Version 4.

The new features and improvements in Version 5 are:

 * Fully updated for Kickstart 2.+ with a menu-driven interface and
   standard windows.
 * 64 MIDI tracks capability, instead of a maximum of 16 tracks of the
   previous versions. This is probably its most important new feature.
 * On-line hypertext instruction which is so user-friendly that a
   separate instruction manual is not needed.
 * Ability to name blocks in the playlist, or attach strings of text,
   so that users can know what happens in each block.
 * Redefinable keys and mouse buttons.
 * Improved control over sampler and sample editor effects: The pitch
   changer has optional anti-aliasing, the volume boost has an optional
   100 per cent limiter to avoid distortion, the filter has a further
   adjustment parameter, and the mix function allows for alteration of
   the relative volumes of the two sounds, unused space can be removed
   from the start or end of a sample, and loop controls are easier to use.
 * Autosave option.

These main features remain the same from Version 4:

 * Powerful sampling software with which users can create their own
   instruments!
 * Standard music notation display mode which allows for composing and
   editing using tracker or stave formats.
 * Print Option - which will print out all blocks in a song, complete
   with play list, instrument names and tempo information.

Here is what CU Amiga Magazine, the second largesst Amiga publication in the
United Kingdom, has to say about the new Version 5:  "OctaMED was already by
far the best MIDI and sample sequencer about - now it's even better." CU
Amiga gave OctaMED a 92% Rating and its Top Rated Award.

Amiga Shopper, another UK-based magazine, also gave OctaMED Professional V5
its maximum 5 Star rating and had this to say:  "A worthwhile investment for
anyone interested in music on the Amiga - highly recommended."

OctaMED Professional was developed by RBF Software and Teijo Kinnunen and
has sold over 100,000 copies worldwide. The new version 5 requires
Kickstart 2.0 or better.

DevWare will market OctaMED Professional Version 5 to end users and dealers
in North America through its DevWare ToolChest division. Previous buyers of
Version 4 will receive an upgrade offer.
