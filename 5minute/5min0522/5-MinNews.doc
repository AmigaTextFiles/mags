              Commodore Announces Amiga 2000 Power Up Program
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Special savings for Amiga 2000 owners on purchase of an Amiga 4000
    ____
   / ___)            West Chester, PA -- May 14, 1993
  / /
 / (__
(_____)ommodore Business Machines, Inc. today announced it is offering
promotional pricing on Amiga 4000 series computers to owners of Amiga 2000
series computers. This Power Up program applies to purchases of an Amiga
4000-040/120 or Amiga 4000-030/120 between May 10 and June 30, 1993. The
promotional pricing is $2349* for the A4000-040/120 and $1599 for the
A4000-030/120, representing substantial savings of $1350 and $800
respectively, based on Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Prices.

"The Power Up program is designed to position the Amiga 4000 as the new base
platform for development of future Amiga products," commented James Dionne,
Commodore President and General Manager. "By not requiring users to trade in
their A2000 computers, the promotion protects the user's investment in
software and add-on hardware while offering advanced Amiga 4000 features at a
substantial discount."

The high performance A4000-040/120 and A4000-030/120 both feature Commodore's
Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) chip set, enabling users to display and
animate graphics in multiple resolutons at up to 256,000 colors from a
palette of 16.8 million. Both systems include AmigaDOS Release 3, Commodore's
multitasking operating system that takes advantage of AGA features while
maintaining backward compatibility with most software developed for earlier
versions of AmigaDOS. Backward compatibility is also maintained for most
peripheral products originally designed for the Amiga 2000 or 3000 computers.

Amiga 2000 Power Up program participants can continue to use accelerated
Amiga 2000s as rendering engines or as front-end systems for more
sophisticated A4000 applications. With the number of Video Toasters installed
in A2000s, the system becomes a profitable enhancement in linked Video
Toaster(TM) 4000 environments.

To receive the promotional pricing purchasers must provide the front cover of
their A2000 owners manual and their A2000 system serial number. Power Up
programing pricing is available at the time of purchase through a
participating Commodore Authorized Reseller in the United States.


Commodore Business Machines, Inc., based in West Chester, PA, is the U.S.
subsidiary of Commodore International Limited. The company manufacturers and
markets a complete line of Amiga computers and peripherals for the business,
consumer, education and government markets. The company's worldwide installed
user base of Amiga computers is presently almost four million.

Amiga(R), AmigaDOS and Advanced Graphics Architecture are trademarks of
Commodore-Amiga,Inc. Video Toaster is a trademark of NewTek, Inc.

(*) A2000 Power Up promotional pricing is subject to dealer participation.
Actual dealer pricing may vary. See dealer for further details.

        SupraTurbo 28 Increases Speed, Not Cost, of Amiga Computers
 ______ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(__  __)                  Albany, OR -- May 1993
  / /
 / /
(_/he new SupraTurbo(TM) 28 accelerates Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 computers
from 7MHz to 28MHz, installs easily with no need to replace the existing
processor, and maintains Supra's reputation for price/performance leadership
with its suggested retail price of $199.95.

"SupraTurbo 28 is not only faster than an un-accelerated Amiga 500 or 2000,
but as the following chart shows, it actually meets or beats the speed of
some 68030 accelerators that cost almost twice as much," said John Wiley,
president of Supra.

Enhance without Concern

Beta test sites report that the SupraTurbo 28 significantly enhances
disk-intensive processes. The Workbench environment is more responsive,
animation can be run at faster speeds, and decompression of files becomes a
snap. Additionally the SupraTurbo 28 speeds processes such as compiling
programs and displaying graphics.

"Another big plus for A500 and A2000 users is that the SupraTurbo 28 lets
them gain the full benefit of high speed modems like the SupraFAXModem
V.32bis," Wiley said. "Without the accelerator, attempts to communicate at
speeds higher than 9600 baud often result in data transmission errors."

The SupraTurbo 28 is fully compatible with the 68000 processor -- this
enables it to run with most software written for the 68000 processor.
However, there may still be cases where the user wants or needs to slow the
computer back to 7 MHz for certain applications. To meet those needs, the
SupraTurbo 28 has both an external on/off switch as well as a software-driven
speed control.

Expand without Compromise

"The SupraTurbo 28 grew out of customer demand," Wiley said. "We have been
selling peripherals to Amiga customers for years, and recently they've been
telling us they want their existing computers to run faster, without
compromising either their already-installed peripherals or their
pocketbooks."

The unique design of the SupraTurbo 28 ensures this level of flexibility for
both A500 and A2000 users. The model designed for the A500 plugs onto the
external expansion bus. A unique bus pass-through slot allows users to add
additional expansion units such as hard drives and RAM. The A2000 model of
the SupraTurbo 28 plugs effortlessly into the 86-pin CPU expansion slot. Its
slim design enhances possibilities for additional internal peripheral
products. The easy installation procedures for both models can be performed
without removing the existing processor and without risking possible
invalidation of warranty.

                      Aladdin4D 2.3 Upgrade is Ready!
    _                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \                   Salem, Ohio -- May 1993
  / - \
 / ___ \
(_/   \_)laddin4D 2.3 is an "interim" upgrade from Adspec Programming. In the
late fall (or early spring) we will release 3.0, a truly major upgrade. As we
have been working on it, we have been asked over and over again for some of
the features we have ready. So we decided to answer these requests with this
interim upgrade. But don't think this is a minor upgrade. It is a truly
enhanced product. NOTE THAT THIS IS A MATH COPROCESSOR VERSION ONLY!

What's New and Different?

New Procedurals
New Bitmap Texture Method
Bitmap List Enable/Disable Reporting
Geo Scaling
Half Res and Double Res Modes
Full 3D Look
Shadow Acceleration
More Accurate Spherical Gases
Retina Support

And of course, we have continued to optimize the render routines for more
speed. This should be obvious in nearly all renders, but especially those
that use gases and/or procedural textures, and shadows. One shadow render I
have took 13+ minutes in 2.1, and takes 59 second in 2.3! This is not typical
but should give you some idea... And you have full control over shadow
optimization. Read the section on shadow acceleration.

New Procedurals

There are several new procedural textures. They are all real knock-outs. Just
select them and hit the suggested gadget. Then alter the parameters to
personalize them. The new ones are Tiles: Burst-Sine, Tiles: Circles2, Tiles:
Fireworks, Tiles: Radial, Tiles: Spirals, Tiles: Spirals-Sawtooth, Tiles:
Ripple1, and Tiles: Ripple2.

New Bitmap Texture Method

There is a new gadget in the texture member control window called "Tiles."
This is completely different from the shingles type. Select a bitmap texture,
turn on this gadget and hit suggested. Try altering the parameters. Also try
wrapping, free angle, etc. It is a true 3D coordinate indexing system. You're
gonna love it!

Bitmap List Enable/Disable Reporting

When you open the TXList window and select a texture list the program now
quickly looks at all polys in all spaces and determines whether it will be
permisible to add/delete members, alter mapping, etc., This is reported at
the bottom of the window. You can still open the member and control windows,
but peritinent gadgets will be disabled if needed. This prevents
inexperienced (and sometimes experienced) users from adding or deleting
levels when all polys are not selected.

Geo Scaling

When you load a geo file you are now asked to give a default scale to use
when converting the geo file. Some programs (Amiga) use coordinates in the
range of -3.0 to 3.0, while others (IBM) save coordinates in the range of
-3000000000000 to 3000000000000! This scale choice handles this nicely.

Half Res and Double Res Modes

When you open the render options/screen mode you will now see 4 new gadgets.
They show capital D and H. The D stands for "double" and the H stands for
"half." You may choose to do either width, height or both. When you choose
the double mode, the program supersamples space by shooting more rays per
pizel. This results in a highly anti-aliased (and anti-noised) image. You may
find that you want to sometimes work in 368x476 DD instead of the usual
736x476 you are used to. The DD modes are most useful when you want
absolutely the best quality. This may be for an image you are going to print,
or that very important still frame or animation. The results are stunningly
better. Expect 3 to 4 times the normal render time, but a vastly improved
image quality.

The HH mode does just the oppostie. It shoots fewer rays, then interpolates
the image into a larger format. The HH modes have two main uses. First you
can see a representation of the image 3 to 4 times faster. These images are
great for a quick idea of how the lights, shadows, textures, etc. are
relating and really speed the throughput of idea development. The second use
is very interesting if you use DCTV. As you know, this device requires a
hires (640-704 wide) image. This means you have to render in hires all the
time, even for your test images. The new HH mode allows you to render in
lowres (320-352 wide) for your test renders and see them at full size. In
other words, if you use DCTV, you can do your test renders 4 times faster. In
our play, we have noticed that some drawings, like gases on backgrounds, look
nearly the same in HH and regular modes, except that typical render times may
be faster by factors of 3 or 4 by using the new HH mode.

Full 3D Look

We have had many requests to dress the interface to a full 2.0 look and feel.
We have done just that. All gadgets and windows now have the 3D look of the
2.0 Workbench.

Shadow Acceleration

To our knowledge this is a true first on any platform or mainframe 3D
application. It is a "lossy" technique we have developed for ray tracing
shadows. It is related in spirit to JPEG and other types of compression, but
instead of compressing data, it compresses sampling with a corresponding
decrease in calculation (and time) required!

You will find the gadget in the shadow area of the attlist member control
window. Default value is 3. Range is 1 to 255, with 1 being the slowest and
most accurate and 255 being the fastest and most lossy. The compression is
applied across each "span." A span is the horizonal area covered by a single
polygon. The acceleration factor (i.e. 3) relates to the number of pixels
covered by the span. If the span is smaller than the requested acceleration,
the acceleration is replaced by the span to prevent extreme loss of shadow
detail. You don't necessarily need to understand all of this. Just try using
different numbers with your stop watch handy and you will see the results.

More Accurate Spherical Gases

A completely different method of determining the boundaries of spherical
gases inside their containers has been developed. It is absolutely accurate,
regardless of the angles of rotation of the container. Gases are also faster
by 20 to 50 percent due in large part to the implementation of much more
efficient sort routines!

Retina Support

A direct render interface is now included for this fine hires resolution
board, joining our already existing support for FireCracker, DCTV, OpalVision
and Resolver, HAM8, etc. Just click the Retina gadget and watch your render
scanline directly in full 24-bit on this board at your choice of resolutions.

                     Aladdin4D Tutorial Video Tape Set!

   \_/\_/hen Adspec Programming appeared on Computer Chronicles many of you
called and said it was very helpful to be able to sit down and watch someone
using Aladdin4D. Requests for a tutorial tape were overwhelming.

So here it is!

As a matter of fact, we went you one better. Instead of one tutorial tape, we
have produced a pair of tapes. Aladdin4D has just too many features to pack
into a single tape.

What's on the Tapes?

We first tried a "manual" approach. Each and every feature would be
painstakingly demonstrated. After a couple of hours of this, two things
became very clear. First, it would take about 12 full length tapes to do it.
Second, they were so boring that we couldn't even watch the first one!

So we switched to a project oriented approach. This is a much better method
of teaching, and the tapes are actually interesting. There are 8
demonstration tutorials. Each lasts about 30 minutes and covers a main idea
or feature. And, of course, as each proceeds you get the reinforcement of
seeing features used over and over again, making them very familiar by the
time you have finished the tapes. The tapes feature Aladdin4D's creator, Greg
Gorby, as he sits down and actually usees the program to create the 8
projects.

Tutorial projects include:

Volume 1: (2 hour cassette)

Flying Logo: Font use is demonstrated as a word is extruded and flown past a
camera, rotating into place, complete with moving background.

Snow Storm: Aladdin4D's abilities in rotoscoping are demonstrated. Two levels
of panning backgrounds are combined with 3 levels of panning overlays as a 3D
crane moves between. A real blizzard!

Child's Mobile: The trace mode and hierarchial linking of paths are featured
as a child's mobile (complete with froggies and fishies) is built and
animated.

Sun & Planet: Space genre fans will just die! To end the first tape, Greg
uses multiple gases to complete (in about 20 minutes) what may be the most
convincing sun you've seen out of a 3D program. Complete with animated flames
and a planet that is semi-cooled and still glowing. Truly good stuff.

Volume 2: (2 hour cassette)

Space Scene: The space theme is continued by building a convincing space ship
using a bump map to convey subtle details. The ship slowly descends, then the
engines suddenly fire (using gases) and propel the ship away. Multiple
attribute list members and bump maps are the focus.

Ball Bounce: A puzzle environment is built from basic building blocks, then a
bouncing helix wrapped ball winds its way through the maze as the camera
follows in hot pursuit.

Insect Waves: A 3D insect flies down to a stone walled pool of water and
bounces on the water 6 times resulting in expanding wave rings. Features
opacity mapping and wave sources.

Davinci Dance: Greg shows how you can fly a camera around a bitmap at will
with precise positioning.


The Aladdin4D Video Tutorial Tape Set is avalable in the complete 2-volume
set only, VHS-NTSC. Available directly from Adspec Programming; orders placed
within the US are $59.95, Canada/Mexico $65.95, Ohio Residents $63.25,

     ____      DESERT STRIKE: Return to the Gulf for the Amiga

   / (_                  San Mateo, CA - May 1993

(____)A's Air force needs one good pilot!

Assignment: With the copilot of your choice fly a solo mission into the heart
of the Middle East.

Objective: Eliminate hostile dictator and his entire military complex.

Category: Action/Simulation

Qualifications: combat experience in AH-64 helicopter and nerves of steel.

Do you have what it takes?  If so, pack your duffel bag and prepare for
Electronic Arts' upcoming release of Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf for
the Amiga. Desert Strike offers fast paced arcade action combined with the
realism and depth of a simulation. Hop into your full-armed Apache and
obliterate the enemy's radar stations, airfields, SCUD launchers, command
centers, chemical weapons plants, and the list goes on. With the freedom to
range over enemy territory at will, sound mission strategy is the key to your
survival.. You see the world from a unique 3/4 top-down perspective, and the
terrain is alive with hostile infantry patrols, tanks, mobile anti-aircraft
guns and surface-to-air- missiles.

Before you can take out the vicious madman who created this global menace,
you must complete four intricate campaigns. Each campaign involves several
dangerous missions which are best accomplished in a logical sequence, and
they take place by both day and night  Success is mandatory; you must
accomplish all the missions in all the campaigns before you learn where the
insane dictator is hiding. Defend oil fields, rescue hostages, capture
commanders, take out nuclear weapons sites-this game tells it like it is. At
intervals you will be awarded stunning cinematic sequences depicting your
latest acts of heroism.

Since this is a solo, clandestine operation, you will have no back-ups and no
radio contact. Success depends on you and your copilot. Your Apache is
equipped with an on-board battle map to help you plot attack routes, and a
flight recorder keeps track of your status throughout each campaign. You
begin with a full tank of gas and a full complement of weapons, but supplies
run out fast and become more and more scarce as the campaigns progress.
Resource management is critical. Take out enemy installations and salvage
their weapons and fuel caches.

Desert Strike is a trademark of Electronic Arts. Contact your authorized
Amiga Reseller for more information.

(_/he Lemmings are back! The next generation of Psygnosis' incredibly
successful game has arrived! Lemmings 2, the long awaited sequel to the award
winning Lemmings brings the same intellectually challenging, fast paced play
to an even higher level.

Having survived the perils of Lemmings and Oh No! More Lemmings, those
lovable green-haired numbskulls have populated every corner of Lemmingland
and evolved into twelve distinct tribes. In addition to their basic walking,
digging, climbing and building skills, each Lemming tribe has developed
unique behaviours that are specifically suited to mastering the dangers found
in their corner of Lemming Island. But, a great danger faces them all and,
you guessted it, YOU'LL HAVE TO SAVE THEM AGAIN; tribe by tribe bringing them
all together for a final exodus.

    Thrill to the radical moves of the Beach Lemmings as they "hang ten"
    and surf past danger!

    Cheer as the Sport Lemmings run and jump across the screen, successfully
    reaching the exit.

    Check out the cool Polar Lemmings when they ski past the hazards of
    their frozen environment.

    Chuckle at the silly Circus Lemmings while they inflate their balloons
    and float across the screen.

Lemmings II also features a host of technical improvements like: eight-way
scrolling; 256 VGA color; rich, sampled sound effects and music; and an
innovative modular design that will allow extensive customization of future
enhancements in sound and video support.

Suggested Retail Price:  $59.95.

Lemmings 2 is shipping NOW from Psygnosis. For more information, contact your
