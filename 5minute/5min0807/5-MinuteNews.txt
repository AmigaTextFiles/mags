             NewTek Debuts 600 MIPS Toaster Screamer at SIGGRAPH
 ______      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(__  __)               Anaheim, CA -- August 5, 1993

(_/he introduction of the NewTek's Video Toaster Screamer is about to cause a
revolution in the 3D industry. Now, creating animation can take less time
that you ever imagined possible. The screamer 3D rendering engine elevated
the Video Toaster into one of the fastest 3D tools ever created. High speed
RISC processors drive the Toaster's built-in lightwave animation system to
deliver twice the 3D rendering power of a Cray 1 supercomputer.

The Screamer is a breakthrough 3D rendering engine designed specifically for
NewTek's Emmy-award winning Video Toaster system. The stunning computing
speed of the screamer is a result of an innovative hardware design based on
multiple RISC processors, four parallel MIPS R4400 Risc processors allow the
creamer to deliver over 600 MIPS system performance. By running each
processor at 150MHZ with both internal and external caches the screamer
reaches an amazing 340 SPECMarks.

The Toaster screamer system comes complete with NTSC video in and out and
takes advantage of the Toasters award winning Lightwave 3D animation system.
Already the most popular 3D animation system in the world, the Video Toaster
and Lightwave have been credited with bringing 3D visual effects to weekly
television for the first time. With complex 3D effects in every episode,
shows such as "Babylon 5" and Steven Spielberg's "SeaQuest DSV" are setting
new standards of excellence.

The Screamer differs from the expensive dedicated 3D workstations in the same
way that the Video Toaster stands out among traditional video gear. The
introduction of the Screamer brings 3D rendering power that was
astronomically expensive to a stunning new price point. At $9995, the Toaster
Screamer offers significantly more rendering power per dollar than any other
3D system in the world. The economics of 3D animation have just changed
forever.

Specifications:

Video Toaster Screamer: $9995.00 (available 4th quarter 93) an external
rendering engine for the Video Toaster

Processors: Four parallel MIPS R4400-64 Bit superpipelined RISC processors

              SIGGRAPH 93 - VR Rides, Art, Jobs Highlight Show
 ______       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(__  __)              Anaheim, CA -- August 5, 1993
  / /
 / /
(_/he SIGGRAPH Show was full of surprises from unusual art to actual virtual
reality rides for show goers. Much emphasis was made on kids, supercomputers,
art, and employment opportunities as well.

Games, entertainment, and education were the themes of the show. Trip
Hawkins, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of 3DO, and chairman of
computer game maker Electronic Arts, was the keynote speaker. Childcare was
offered at the show, but many show goes had their children with them as many
of the booths and exhibits featured games or hands-on activities for children
and adults. An entire portion of the show floor was given to Sigkids, an
exhibit of hands-on computer activities by and for elementary age children.

But many of the adults were acting like children at play in virtual reality
exhibits from Silicon Graphics Incorporated (SGI), Evans and Sutherland, and
in an area where interactive art exhibits were displayed. The SGI exhibit was
obviously inspired by the movie Jurassic Park and show goers where waiting
over an hour in winding Disneyland-like lines to enter a giant box and get a
chance to climb into a saddled Teradactyl. Of the groups who entered the box
only three were allowed to actually ride, but the watchers could see the
virtual scene as well.

Evens and Sutherland offered a chance to ride a virtual hang- glider through
a crowded city-scape. Two hang-glider simulations were running and show goers
were helped into body-length slings that hung them suspended in front of a
viewing screen. Their faces were then situation in virtual space. They
controlled their movement through the space via a hang-glider bar grasped
with both hands. Speakers on each side of their heads provided the sound.
Lines were long to ride and riders told Newsbytes the sensation of
hang-gliding was very real despite the comic book appearance of the city
landscape through which they flew.

In an area featuring electronic art, show goers could stop at an electronic
confessional to confess their sins. Based on the confessions of the Catholic
church, the automated religion kiosk, called "Catholic Turing Test" by
Gregory P. Garvey of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, was a thin, shiny, black
plastic structure with a red neon cross at the top and a red kneeling bench
in front. Only large enough for one, an Apple Macintosh SE and Hypercard were
used to create the confessional program which started by asking how long it
had been since you'd been to confession and gave you the option of typing in
a number and choosing either days, weeks, months, or years. Users selected
sins from a menu and were told at the end of the confession what type of sins
they were and how many "Hail Marys" were needed for penance.

Next door was a group of tables where show goers who sat down to relax were
eventually bumped and mumbled at by what appeared to be a giant bowling ball.
Called "Adelbrecht" by Momevideo, Amsterdam, Netherlands designer Martin
Spanjaard, the mobile robot moved around under its own power, bumping into
chairs and people, and changing direction while making beeping and whirring
noises, and mumbling unintelligible speech to show goers.

The "Neuro Baby" was a monitor in a crib that displayed a pink, cartoonish,
buggy-eyed "baby" face that bounced around on the screen and responded to
attendees who bent down to speak into a microphone by the crib. Monitors near
the crib showed people who were waiting in line the responses of the baby.
The baby laughed, cried, said "Hi," rolled its eyes, and even got red-faced
mad when Newsbytes laughed at it. Lines were long to talk to the baby and it
was surprising how many people simply yelled into the microphone. Naoko Tosa
of Ogikubo Suginami-Ku, Tokyo said the voice analysis was performed by a
neural network emulator that converted voice input into "emotional" patterns
based on the wave patterns to which the computer had been "taught" to
respond. A Fujitsu FM Towns multimedia personal computer was used for the
voice analysis, another FM Towns for voice generation, and a SGI Iris 4D was
used to generate the image of the baby.

"The Flock," by Ken Rinaldo and Mark Grossman of San Francisco, California,
was a room of robotic arms hanging from the ceiling and extending just a few
inches above the floor. The arms responded to the movement and voice
intonation of visitors. The arms were unusual as they were partially made
from the dried branches of vines so they appeared to be a strange mix of
organic and electronic material and looked like the limbs of live trees
reaching toward and moving away from visitors. The artists described the arms
as "cybernetic sound sculptures that exhibit behaviors found in natural
groups such as birds, fish, and bats." Acoustic, kinetic, and infrared
sensors on the arms detected sounds and movements and responded. The exhibit
had visitors talking, waving their hands, and walking around these strange
arms. One of the artists was seen to yell and pull at a visitor saying,
"Don't let it touch you" and explained that the arms are fragile and could be
broken by contact. However it was difficult with the unexpected movements of
the long, jointed arms to stay out of the way.

Much talk among show goers concerned supercomputers and virtual reality and
the San Diego Supercomputer Center was represented at the show. The use of
supercomputers for complex techniques such as reconstructing the shape of a
fetus from ultrasound measurements or visualization of global climate
research was emphasized by the San Diego group.

Interactivity was emphasized, not only between people and computers, but
between show attendees. Several locations had tables and comfortable seating,
an international center was available, and even a jobs and message center was
near the show floor. The jobs board took up two sides of the large four-sized
cubical structure that housed it and every inch of space was filled with jobs
postings. Newsbytes was curious to see if the jobs postings were for
positions wanted, but the jobs were all help wanted ads for graphics artists,
designers, and programmers who had graphics experience from large companies
such as Avid and Microsoft as well as from small companies.

Attendance figures were not available by press time, but the show took up
most of the huge Anaheim Convention Center and it was crowded. SIGGRAPH runs
until Friday in Anaheim. SIGGRAPH '94 has been announced by for July 24-29 at
the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida.

                        More CD32 Details and Games
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ____            University of Wales -- August 4, 1993
  (_  _)         by Mike Richards Internet: mhr@aber.ac.uk
   / /
 _/ /
(____) have had a couple of requests of details of the article in CU Amiga
this month on the CD32, this is a summary of the article - some of us don't
have an OCR system! :)

What does it look like?

The CD32 console is about the size of a sheet of A4 paper, and about 2 inches
deep. The top has a slight bulge to accomodate the top-loading CD player. The
CD player is set off to the left-hand side of the machine. The top of the
player is stamped with `32bit' in much the same way as the Sega Megadrive.

The machine is dark grey or black in colour, it is labelled in grey and red.
The full name is `Amiga CD32' (with the `32' written as a superscript).
`Commodore' is stamped into the machine top, but isn't very prominent. (Is
this significant? :)

Facilities?

The controls on the console are set to the bottom-right of the machine. From
left to right they are :

A reset button, a volume slider for headphones, and a headphone socket.

Outputs are located at the back. They are a S-Video output, composite output
and RF out jacks. There is *NO* RGB output.

None of the pictures I have seen show where the controllers plug into the
console. My best guess is on the left-hand side somewhere. The machine is
supplied with 1 controller.

The controller looks very much like a SNES controller. On the left of the
controller is a black joypad, the right-hand side of the controller has 4
buttons arranged like the SNES controller. According to CU Amiga there are 11
buttons on the controller!

The machine has an expansion port at the back, and can apparently be
hooked up to a floppy disk drive.

Inside

Internally the machine is based on the A1200, it has the same Motorola
68EC020 central processor, plus the AGA chipset. The console is capable of
displaying all the AGA modes.

The only change in the chipset is a large square processor which is capable
of converting chunky pixel graphics (a la PC for instance), into Amiga
bitplane graphics. No speed or power ratings were mentioned.

The machine is fitted with 2Mb of 32-bit chip memory, there does not seem to
be room on the motherboard for extra memory.

Also included is 1K of flashRAM, Commodore are hoping that game designers
will use this area for saved games. Because the area is too small to store
all but the simplest data, it is expected that designers will have to use
password saves like in `The Chaos Engine'.

The CD drive is a dual-speed unit, capable of transfer rates of either
150Kb/s or 300Kb/s. The player is capable of playing CD+G disks in the same
way that the CDTV used to. No news on CDi, or Kodak PhotoCD compatibility
though...

MPEG compatibility to give Full Motion Video WILL be available at a later
date. (A date of Autumn 1993 has been mentioned).

Compatibility?

Commodore are saying the machine has 60% compatibility with existing CDTV
titles. (I think they gave much the same figure for the A1200 and it proved
an underestimate). Most of the incompatibility is due to the changes in the
AGA chipset.

It is not expected that much of the new software output will be downwardly
compatible. (In a separate interview, the MD of Commodore UK said that there
MAY be a trade in for existing CDTV owners.)

How Much?

299.99 Pounds is the UK RRP, expect to see it discounted in the shops though.
Games will cost between 19.95 Pounds and 29.95 Pounds. The machine pack will
contain the console, a controller and one or two game disks.

Expect in the shops sometime this month.

Games?

You bet, here is the list, as supplied by CU Amiga of titles in the pipeline.
Don't blame me if they don't appear!

         T-Rexx Professional, Toaster System Integrator, Upgraded
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         T-Rexx Professional, ASDG's highly rated Toaster system
         integrator, has been upgraded. The new release supports
         both the Toaster 2.0 and Toaster 3.0 operating environments
         including support for many of the new capabilities of the
         Toaster 4000. Existing T-Rexx Professional 2.0 owners can
         upgrade to version 2.1 for a nominal fee.
    _
   / \                 Madison, WI -- July 20, 1993
  / - \
 / ___ \
(_/   \_)SDG Incorporated, the leading supplier of color imaging solutions
for the Commodore Amiga, announces the availability of version 2.1 of its
highly rated T-Rexx Professional.

T-Rexx is called "the Toaster System Integrator" because it combines total
control over NewTek's Video Toaster with control over other important
hardware and software products (such as Studio 16, AmiLink, and even ASDG's
Art Department Professional). The new release of T-Rexx extends its control
abilities to version 3.0 of the Toaster system software and the Toaster 4000
hardware.

Among the additions in T-Rexx Professional 2.1 are: ability to read and write
Toaster 3.0 croutons and projects - access to the new "G", "H" and "I"
effects banks -- support for the new Switcher commands -- Toaster 3.0 "look
and feel" -- support for multiple Toaster "devices."

T-Rexx's unequalled processing and handling of Organic and Action
wipes/effects has also been enhanced to support the creation and modification
of such effects under the Toaster 3.0 operating environment.

T-Rexx 2.1 can be installed to run either as a Toaster 2.0 or 3.0 system
integrator. And, taking into account the ease with which T-Rexx Professional
can be customized to control new peripherals and software, version 2.1 even
comes with a utility which will automatically fold existing T-Rexx 2.0
customizations into T-Rexx 2.1.

T-Rexx Professional has quickly gained recognition as an essential Toaster
adjunct. The August 1993 AmigaWorld calls T-Rexx an "indispensable tool for
Toaster users." The August 1993 Amazing Computing states, "T-Rexx is
intuitive, easy to use, well documented, and full of examples from which to
learn both ARexx and video device control techniques. It's a wonderful
program...".

Existing owners of T-Rexx 2.0 can upgrade to T-Rexxx 2.1 for the nominal fee
of $10. To upgrade or to learn more about any of ASDG's award winning color
imaging products, contact Ms. Gina Cerniglia at ASDG Incorporated, 925
Stewart Street, Madison, WI, 53713 or call 608/273-6585. You can also leave a

         Third Party Products Make ADPro All Things to All People
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         A number of third parties have released products designed
         to harness Art Department Professional's many strengths.
         Products such as MultiFrame, ANIMWorkShop, ProCONTROL,
         ADPTools and ADPTools II extend ADPro's enormous image and
         video processing power by providing alternative user
         interfaces tailored to specific audiences and purposes.
    _
   / \                 Madison, WI -- May 19, 1993

 / ___ \
(_/   \_)SDG Incorporated, a leading supplier of color imaging solutions for
the motion picture and television industry, is pleased to draw attention to a
number of third party products supporting ASDG's flagship Amiga products, Art
Department Professional and MorphPlus.

While ADPro has always excelled in the processing of streams of images, third
parties are now releasing products whose user interfaces are designed to make
such processing even easier.

These alternative user interfaces act as front-ends to ADPro and MorphPlus
and are tailored to specific classes of users. Products such as ProCONTROL
and ADPTools are designed to allow novices to create and control general
purpose batch processes. ANIMWorkShip, also designed for the novice, is
tailored for animation building and processing fuctions.

Power users can use MultiFrame-ADPro and ADPTools II to push the Amiga
personal computer to the forefront of broadcast production on the desktop.

Mr. Bob Tingly, of MacroSystemsUS, chose to develop for ADPro because it "is
the best image manipulation tool for the Amiga and has the largest installed
base. And ASDG has been very helpful." These sentiments were echoed by Mr.
Tom Gutchigian of ASA Publishing Company. He added, "ADPro was thought
through on the front-end, making it easier to create add-ons. It's a well
designed product."

ASDG's reaction to third party add-on development has been one of
encouragement and facilitation. Ms. Gina Cerniglia, ASDG's sales manager,
pointed out "the fact that a number of third parties are linking the success
of their companies to the success of ADPro and MorphPlus is a compelling
demonstration of ASDG's leadership in the Amiga color imaging marketplace."

ASDG's color imaging products have been used in such recent broadcast
projects as Quantum Leap, Babylon 5, and The Tommyknockers.

     ____     Keys to Music, Vol. 2 Released by Electric Theatre
    / ___)    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / (_                Elkins Park, PA -- August 5, 1993
  / ___)
 / (_
(____)LECTRIC THEATRE, located in Elkins Park, PA is pleased to announce the
release of Volume 2 of Keys To Music. It is entitled "Learning To Write
Music." This is both a continuation of "Volume 1: Learning to Read Music" and
follows through into melody construction and writing songs. (NTSC/PAL
compatible)

Keys to Music, Volume 2, is the second in a series of five volumes. It
teaches time signatures, all major and minor scales, key signatures, English
and Italian dynamic marks and tempo symbols, commonly used musical
"shorthand," the beginnings of musical form and composition, and demonstrates
the writing of a song.

Volumes 1 and 2 are extremely comprehensive yet make learning music fun. They
use an interactive multi-media style which utilizes synthesized speech,
print, click to play examples, history, and printed assignments.

The music teacher will find that Keys to Music complements the study of any
instrument. It teaches and tests the students and records their progress.

For Amiga users who want to compose music and/or use the Amiga as a musical
instrument, Keys To Music will supply the necessary musical knowledge to
enable them to experiment and have fun while successfully using the many MIDI
sequencers and printing programs on the market.

Keys To Music is a valuable music teaching program; valuable for musicians
who want to become more capable, for beginners who want to begin studying an
instrument, for teachers because of the valuable time the program saves and
because of the help it will give their students, and for the computer user
who wants to compose music on and for his/her computer.

Peabody Institute, the music conservatory of Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, Maryland, is using Keys to Music as a teaching tool. It is being
used successfully with students as young as 7 years old on up to professional
adults. The enthusiastic support of such a prestigious music conservatory
certifies the value of the program content as well as its presentation.

For additional literature, or to place an order, contact Electric Theatre,
111 Holme Avenue, #2, Elkins Park, PA  19117, USA (215)379-4538. Keys To
Music is available at your favorite Amiga dealer. The retail price for each
volume is $59.95 U.S.

     _____      It's time for... GEAR WORKS from HOLLYWARE!
    / ____)     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / /___           Marina del Rey, CA -- August 1, 1993
  / /(   )
 / (__) /
(______/et ready for some fast-paced fun! Gear Works is an addictive gear
game that allows you to transform Twelve Wonders of the World into time
pieces. This visually innovative game will test your reflexes, intelligence
and your nerves. Remember time is tick, tick, ticking away! Just like any
other machine, there are bugs, in this case Poffins, that try to damage the
mechanism by resting the gears and breaking off the mounting pegs. But there
are ways around them, like shooting 'em, but be careful not to waste your
ammunition. There is also an oil can that will "lube up" any rusted gears.

The music and sound effects add fun and tension as you try to solve this
puzzling twelve monument game. Another fun feature of Gear Works is the slot
machine set up between levels so that you can add to your score or additional
supplies. There is an access code given after completing each monument
allowing direct access to the next one.

Features:

 * Twelve mouments divided into levels with more than 100 play areas to
   test reflexes and your intelligence.
 * Use bombs to blow up improperly placed gears.
 * Use the oil can to free up rusted gears.
 * Try your luck with the slot machine between levels to increase your
   score and obtain necessary supplies.
 * Code word access to any completed level.
 * Manual based copy protection.

Gear Works has been called the "Tetris" of the 90s. Some have nick-named it
"the hair puller." We think you'll call it "endless fun!"

Gear Works is available on the Amiga, IBM and Commodore formats through the
normal distribution channels or may be purchased directly from HOLLYWARE
Entertainment. Game Boy and Game Gear versions will be available in the third
quarter of 1993 from Sony ImageSoft.

Suggested Retail Price:

  $49.95 for Amiga and IBM versions
  $39.95 for Commodore 64 version

For more information contact HOLLYWARE Entertainment, 13464 Washington Blvd.,
Maria del Rey, CA 90291, telephone 310/822-9200, fax 310/390-0457.
