(_/   \_)SDG is considering creating a "super-bundle" that will contain
several ASDG products together at a reduced cost. To help determine if we
should invest resources in new packaging for the "super-bundle," we are test
marketing the idea via electronic networks.

Included in the bundle are:

  Product                              List Price

  Art Department Professional             $299
  Pro Conversion Pack                      $90
  Morph Plus                              $295
  ProCONTROL                               $90
  T-Rexx Professional                     $249
                                        -------
  Total Value                            $1023

All of these products together (in their full form but without their usual
packaging) are being test marketed for a combined price of $395. This test
will conclude on July 31st, 1993, and is available to end-users only.

Art Department Professional and MorphPlus need no other introduction. The Pro
Conversion Pack adds comprehensive support for the TIF, TGA, RENDITION, X,
SUN, and PICT file formats to both ADPro and MorphPlus. ProCONTROL is an
alternative user interface/scripting environment for ADPro and MorphPlus.
T-Rexx is a powerful Toaster system integrator and is such a flexible
scripting environment (with built-in command sets for many programs including
ADPro and MorphPlus), it is very useful even to people without Toasters.

If you're interested in this bundle, give Gina at ASDG a call at 608/273-6585
for an exact price including shipping.

(_/o all AmigaVision users, present and future! Mr. Wayne Lutz, the
programmer who made AmigaVision possible, is now available on the *Starship*.
This is great news since he wants to help users with AV flows, and he will
answer any questions you might have.

AmigaVision V1.53,1.70z and Professional is a fantastic multimedia program! I
have used it since it first came out and without any programming backround it
has allowed me to learn basic programming on my own. I have enjoyed my Amiga
tremendously. I would like to encourage everybody to play with AmigaVision
since I believe that once you pass the initial learning curve you will be
"hooked."

I was fortunate to meet Wayne at the last DEVCON in Orlando, FL, and I am
very pleased that he has joined GEnie to answer any questions that we might
have about AV flows. Wayne is presently employed by CATS at Commodore
Business Machines and has been working on AV tools and objects. He has other
responsabilities besides AmigaVision but is willing to help popularize this
fantastic multimedia program. Let's hope the everybody takes advantage of
this opportunity!

Wayne, welcome to the *StarShip*! I think it is great to have THE AmigaVision
programmer on board. I took the occasion to write this small tstxt file to
all *Starship* members about you and about AmigaVision.

Maybe we can generate new interest in AmigaVision and AmigaVision Pro!

Recently, I downloaded file #19850 F&BSLSHOW.AVF from the *StarShip* Library.
It demonstrates an example of how to use Left and Right mouse buttons to
operate a simple slide show.

For the sake of the members, Wayne, is there another way of implementing an
slide show AV Flow with forward and backward features? Any one in the
audience?

For more information, join AmigaVision programmer Wayne Lutz, the author of
this article, Mariano Alvira, and other interested parties in *StarShip*
Bulletin Board CATegory 7, Topic 2: Multimedia: Presentation Applications &
Technique.

     Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Support MPEG 1, Video on CD Format
    _~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \             Beverly Hills, CA -- June 24, 1993
  / - \
 / ___ \
(_/   \_) group of leading consumer electronic manufacturers and program
content providers announced Thursday at the Digital World conference that
they will support the distribution of video on Compact Disc.

These discs will use the MPEG 1 standard for the compression of video and
audio data.

Further, the manufacturers have agreed to support the Karaoke CD format
proposed by JVC and Philips Consumer Electronics which will ensure that video
CD programs can be played interchangeably on a wide variety of platforms.
Companies supporting the format include Commodore International, C-Cube
Microsystems, E-Motions, Goldstar Co., Ltd., JVC, Paramount Home Video,
Philips and Samsung Co.

The Karaoke CD format was proposed by JVC and Philips in October 1992 and
will be officially unveiled at the CD-I Developer's Conference in London on
June 29 and 30. The standard was originally proposed to ensure that CD titles
created for video karaoke players were interchangeable. However, the format
is not limited to karoke applications, but is suitable for all linear video
applications, including music videos and film.

MPEG 1 compression technology allows 74 minutes of VHS-quality video and
CD-quality audio to be played from a Compact Disc. Video on CD brings the
same durability, random accessibility, and affordability of audio CDs to
consumers who desire these same conveniences for video. The types of
applications envisioned for this medium include music videos, karaoke, games,
education, training, movies, and other consumer-oriented video programs.

Directory information on video CD format discs is compatible with both
interactive players (such as CD-I, Commodore Amiga, 3DO, Macintosh,
PC-compatibles etc.) and linear play machines (karaoke or movie players). To
support interactive machines,the directory format is compatible with CD-ROM
XA, including all ISO 9660 compatible CD drives. To support simple Karaoke
and video players, a program content list is located in a "Video Basic
Information Area," which is always located in the same position on the disc.
Version 1.0 of the Karaoke CD format specification was published in February
1993.

"The adoption of a standard format for MPEG video CDs will allow the owners
of music videos and films to release material on a single format and reach
the widest audience," said Alexandre Balkanski, worldwide vice president of
sales and marketing for C-Cube Microsystems. "The wide adoption of this video
CD format ensures consumers that their video titles will play on any one of
the new video CD players coming to market this year."

"The Karaoke CD format will be a trigger for the audio/visual industry to
create new motion video products based on the MPEG standard," commented
Hirotada Sasaki, director and senior general manager, professional products
and information systems sector for the Victor Co. of Japan (JVC).

John Hawkins, director and general manager Philips Interactive Media Systems,
commented, "Philips expects that this format has the same impact on the video
industry as the Compact Disc had on the music industry 10 years ago."

"Consumers want a comfortable platform for linear interactivity and easy
operations for MPEG FMV playback," commented Michael Kim, executive director
of Goldstar Co.

Yeong Kim, general manager of Audio Division at Samsung revealed, "Samsung
will introduce their first Video CD players to the Korean Market in spring
'94 at a retail price of under $650."

"Philips is excited to see the wide acceptance of MPEG demonstrated by this
announcement." noted Emiel Petrone, PIMA senior vice president of sales and
marketing. "Broad availability of MPEG players ensures that program producers
will have a ready market for their titles, with consumer seeing the ultimate
benefit in breadth of content."

"The Amiga is the industry's most popular video-based computer, and MPEG
represents the next logical step," said Lew Eggebrecht, vice president of
engineering for Commodore International. "A standard format of MPEG video on
CD ensures against consumer confusion and guarantees the largest possible
market for all player manufactuers."

"One hundred million PC-compatible machines can be upgraded to play MPEG
video from CDs," said Julien Nguyen, president of E-Motions Inc. "The impact
on the PC market will be tremendous, because MPEG dramatically raises the
standard for high-quality, full-screen, full-motion video on the PC."

C-Cube Microsystems organized this group of player manufacturers and content
developers to minimize consumer concerns about title compatibility with a
variety of video-capable CD players.  C-Cube has played a leading role in the
development of the MPEG standard and is a supplier of MPEG encoding and
decoding chips to the consumer electronics industry.

The Moving Picture Expert Group is a Working Group that was established by
the International Standards Organization (ISO) to develop a standard for the
compression of full-motion digital video. The standard developed by this
group, commonly referred to as MPEGI, was officially adopted by the ISO in
November of 1992. MPEG has been widely adopted by the consumer electronics,
cable television, and direct broadcast satellite (DBS) industries. C-Cube
Microsystems, N.V. Philips, and JVC played leading roles in the development
of the MPEG standard and in the introduction of MPEG-compatible integrated
circuits.

  ____     New for Studio 16: SampleXfer, the Sample Transfer Module
 / ___)    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
( (__              Sooke, BC, Canada -- June 11, 1993
 \__ \
 ___) )
(____/ampXfer is a sophisticated MIDI musician's utility for the transferral
of professional quality audio samples between various MIDI samplers and
Studio 16. This software tool will close the creative loop that starts with
the performance and progresses to the sound editing environment. Now the
engineer or performer can receive perfect material from the end product to
use again in the creative process, providing superior editing for your
samples. The performing musician will now find the ultimate in performance
sample recording and editing systems in Studio 16. Here he can record samples
of whatever quality he may require and recombine them in the most intuitive
and easily learned environment possible. Now, with the addition of SampXfer
the performer's ultimate sample editing tool is complete. You are no longer
bound to the large, expensive, and limited dedicated sampling instrument. Any
sample playback instrument will now not only have access to Studio 16's
recording environment, but through SampXfer and Studio 16, you will now be
able to transfer all of your old sample libraries from your samplers into
your modern tools.

The Technology

SampXfer pushes the "state of the art" envelope for Amiga MIDI support by
doing something no other program suporting MIDI sample dumps can do. Amiga or
otherwise. The Amidi Systems' custom serial port handlers allow Amiga's Exec
to fully support the multitasking user environment during large high speed
MIDI sample dumps without interruption! No screen blanks, no hanging, nothing
but pure uninterrupted access to the flow of control of the Amiga's graphic
user interface at the same time our custom Serial Interrupt Vectors are
handling al incoming and outgoing MIDI sample data, even with samplers which
stream the digital audio data in at full duplex mode without packeting. These
custom interrupt handlers are installed and removed from the Amiga's Exec
legally and SampXfer retains a pointer to the previous serial port handlers
and politely replaces them after using the port. Much thanks to Carl
Sassenrath for technical support in their development.

The Advantage

The custom Amidi serial vectors are written in assembly and are blazingly
efficient! The CPU timeslices used by our handlers amount to such small
overhead that the user may continue using other applications with little or
no hesitation. The standard AmigaDOS Serial.Device is far to slow to handle
the rigors of many system exclusive sample dumps without missing significant
amounts of data, so SampXfer transparently borrows the serial port only
during sample dumps as executed by the user, and with the greatest finesse
recovers all incoming MIDI data, at all other times returning the serial
resource back to whichever task had it previously.

Memory Usage

Memory is allocated dynamically at runtime according to the demands of the
sample that is being manipulated. SMDI sample dumps are executed directly to
and from disk storage, and thus facilitates the movement of very large
samples. Memory is handled internally in 16-bit sample words, but can be
received or sent in whichever bit resolution the user's sampler will support.
The actual value is hidden, as it is set relative to the current sampler's
protocol. SampXfer always attempts to use the highest resolution available up
to 16-bit.

Transfer Protocols

MIDI Samplers currently supported are Prophet 2000 (untested), Akai S700,
S7000, S900, S950; Roland MKS-100, S-10, S-50, S-220, S-330, and all MIDI
Sample Dump Standard machines such as Akai S1000, S1100, Roland's S550, S770,
Yamaha's TX16W, and many others too numerous to name here. SCSI digital
transmission technology called SMDI is also supported. Some SMDI samplers are
the Peavy SP, the Kurzweil K2000, and several Roland and Akai SCSI equipped
samplers. Ask your dealer if your SCSI equipped sampler will support SMDI.

SampXfer retails for $149.94 U.S. For more information, contact Amidi Systems
Incorporated, #4, 6579 Throup Rd., Sooke BC Canada V0S-1N0.

(_____/wners of ProWrite from New Horizons, will be interested in downloading
Library File #19929 PROWRITE_PATCH 3.32.LZH. Here's how to upgrade your copy
of ProWrite, as instructed in that file:

This patch archive may be freely distributed as long as all of the files of
this archive are moved together and not separated.

Files included:
   ProWrite_3.3.1 (initial patch script)
   PW_Patch_Readme
   Patch_Script       (actual patch script)
   PW3.3.1-3.3.2.pch
   lpatch             (Copyright by Lattice)

To patch ProWrite, simply move the files of this archive into the directory
where ProWrite is installed. Then, execute the "ProWrite_Program" script
either from the CLI/Shell, or by clicking on its icon. After the patching is
done, you may remove the five files in this archive. This script will
determine which version of ProWrite that you have and install the correct
patch for it.

This version works correctly under Workbench 1.3 and 2.0.

These files will patch ProWrite 3.3.1 to version 3.3.2.

As a note:
  The file PW3.3.1-3.3.2.pch is the ProWrite 3.3.1 to 3.3.2 patch file.

  lpatch is the file that does the patching and is freely distributable.

If you would like to patch the files yourself and bypass the script, you may
get a synopsis of how the lpatch command works by typing 'lpatch' on a
CLI/Shell prompt line by itself. It contains the necessary information on how
it works.

                 Apple Faces Brave New World After Sculley
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 _        _                 By Russell Blinch
( \  /\  / )      San Francisco, Reuter -- June 21, 1993
 \ \/  \/ /
  \      /
   \_/\_/ith John Sculley's departure from day-to-day operations at Apple
Computer Inc., the company that invented the Macintosh faces the daunting
task of remaking itself in a brave new world populated by lean and cunning
adversaries.

Wall Street analysts say they hope President Michael Spindler, who took over
Sculley's duties as chief executive last week, will make tough decisions
about Apple's cost structure that could mean huge layoffs.

"Spindler is much more focused on what needs to be done and clearly that is
what Apple needs right now," said Dean Witter analyst Eugene Glazer.

Sculley is given high marks for his 10 years at the helm of Apple, the No.
2-ranked maker of personal computers after International Business Machines
Corp. But analysts say it is increasingly evident that the company must
remake itself in order to remain a front-line player.

In recent years, Apple's challenges have been mounting: The price war in the
PC industry rages relentlessly while its cost structure appears too high to
compete in a market wracked by years of fierce price competition.

Apple's travails came to the fore earlier this month when the company issued
a profit warning and announced lower prices on PCs.

The stock fell sharply, losing more than 30 percent of its value in the weeks
that followed. On Monday, it shed another $1.375 to close at $39.625 a share
on the Nasdaq market.

Because of the company's problems, analysts say Spindler's rise to CEO could
not be more timely.

Spindler, a German engineer, joined Apple in 1980 as marketing manager for
European operations and quickly gained a reputation as a tough operator.

"He has done some very good things at Apple," commented Bear Stearns analyst
Andy Neff.

Since coming to Apple's Cupertino, Calif., headquarters in 1985, Spindler has
gradually taken over many day-to-day tasks, while Sculley concentrated on the
longer term as well as traveling the country speaking at trade shows and
appearing as a talk show guest.

Nevertheless, Spindler's job will not be easy.

Analysts say Apple must walk a delicate tight rope of cutting costs and
product prices while also maintaining enough new spending to bring on its new
technologies in the hand-held and multimedia markets.

"I think Mike Spindler has got his nose to the grindstone and pretty decisive
action is coming soon," predicted analyst David Wu at S.G. Warburg.

Wu said Apple will likely move soon to pare some 2,000 jobs from it worldwide
payroll of 15,000 and take other measures to slash costs.

Because of the tough competitive outlook, analysts are continuing to chop
Apple's profit estimates. On the lower end, Dean Witter cut its 1993 estimate
Monday to $3.40 per share from $4.00 and its 1994 estimate to $3.90 from
$4.50.

Analysts say Spindler's biggest challenge is learning to live with a
shrinking profit outlook while fighting off the challenge from rival
Microsoft Corp.

Increasingly, analysts say, Apple's Macintosh line appears to have lost its
technological advantage over IBM compatible computers because of Microsoft's
easy to use Windows operating software.

And that means the pricing premium over IBM computers that Apple has long
enjoyed will likely be sharply reduced or even eliminated.

"This is the constant challenge of Apple against Microsoft and who is going
to lead going forward," said analyst Glazer.

                   AmiGames Trivia Contest Deadline Nears!
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ____          by Peter Olafson, *StarShip* AmiGames Host
  (_  _)             and AmigaWorld Games Columnist
   / /
 _/ /
(____)'ve changed the format for the third in our series of AmiGames
 *StarShip* Trivia Contests. This time, rather than a single question, it's
a full-blown quiz, and a tough one to boot.

The quiz follows. Load it into your favorite WP, answer the questions as best
you can, save it all as a pure ASCII file (I won't accept non-ASCII
submissions) and send it to PETEROO via Email. Best of luck.

Deadline for responses: The end of June.

See topic 1 on the Holodeck for a list of prizes. The big prize is now in the
neighborhood of 40 playable game demos.

Here we go:

1) List as many releases as you can by Incognito Software. (4 points for
each)

2) What was Sierra's last Amiga game? (2 points) Its first? (10 points)

3) Kevin Bulmer is the co-author of U.S. Gold's Legends of Valour. What was
his previous -- and superficially similar -- game release? (5 points) Name
another game with which he was involved. (10 points)

4) How many releases have there been in Paul Woakes' Mercenary series? Name
them. (4 points each)

5) What's the highest memory requirement for any Amiga game? (7 points)

6) Name five would-be Amiga games that were developed, but killed before
release. (5 points each)

7) Which Amiga game or games has/have the most disks? (4 points)

8) Name all the games you can think of that include the word "Operation" in
the title. Include the publisher for each. (2 points for each title, and one
additional point for each publisher)

9) Name an Amiga game that adds extra features on machines with more than 1.5
megs of memory. (5 points)

10) There is a commercial version of DonkeyKong for the Amiga. What was it
called? (20 points) What was the name of the PD versions? (3 points)

11) Name the most obscure Amiga game you can think of. The only requirement
is that it has to have been a commercial release. (This is subjective, but
I'll rate your answer on a scale from 1 to 25 points -- but 1 being Shadow of
the Beast II and 20 being ... well, that's for you to figure out. :-> Trick
answers -- i.e. games that don't exist -- will be penalized 25 points.)

12) Name as many Amiga game construction kits as you can. (4 points each)

13) Name each of Incentive Software's filled-polygon adventures. There are
five. (3 points each up to three, five points each for any beyond that)

14) Actionware released a series of shooting-gallery style games for use with
its light gun. Name them. (2 points each. Bonus of 5 points for naming all of
them. Extra 10 points for naming the Actionware game that -isn't- a
shooting-gallery game.)

15) Name the four (yes, four) Psygnosis games that are hard-disk installable.
(2 points each up to 3, and 10 for naming all four).

16) Name as many Amiga pinball games as you can. (2 points each for the first
two, 4 points each after that)

17) There are two LodeRunner clones for the Amiga. Name them both. (6 points
for both.) A 3-point bonus for giving the original public-domain name of one
of them.

18) Name all SSI's Civil War for the Amiga. There are three. (7 points for
all of them)

19) Which Amiga game has the best end sequence? (Yes, that's subjective, too,
but it's fun. I have one in mind, but I'm open-minded about this. Persuade
me.) (15 points)

20) Name the Amiga clones of the C64 game, Thrust. (4 points for the first,
10 points for each additional)

21) Name the -worst- Amiga game. I know, once again, this is subjective, so
persuade me. Again, I'll assign points based on how good your answer is -- up
to 25 for a real dog.

22) Name all of Cinemware's games for the Amiga. One point apiece up to 5, 2
points apiece for any after that.

23) Silmarils' recent RPG Ishar is actually a sequel. Name the original game.
(5 points)

24) Name two Bullfrog games that did -not- see general release. (This is a
toughie. 20 points)

25) What does "Chrome" mean to you? (12 points)


Talk to Peter Olafson in the AmiGames Real-Time Conference on Wednesdays at
10PM EDT, and in *StarShip* Bulletin Board CATegory 6 The *HoloDeck* -
