This exciting new service (called the Multimedia RoundTable, for short) is
managed by Peggy Herrington, *StarShip* Liason Officer, Amiga freelancer,
Editor of GEnie LiveWire magazine, and founder of the first multimedia
disk-based magazine, New AMnews. Peggy is assisted by Denny Atkin, formerly
Technical Editor of New AMnews, Editor of COMPUTE's Amiga Resource (both now
sadly defunct), and author of "Denny Atkin's Best Amiga Tips and Secrets,"
published by COMPUTE Books.

"Multimedia and desktop video bring live, moving graphics and sound from the
real world into the control of personal computers," says Denny, "with the
primary difference being interactivity and whether the results are viewed on
a monitor or a TV screen. Virtual Reality (VR) makes these elements 3D,
taking the experience from one of looking at a screen to one of diving into
it. We're addressing all of these areas."

The Multimedia RoundTable emphasizes interactive multimedia, desktop video
production techniques, and VR on IBM-compatible, Macintosh and Amiga
platforms, providing information and assistance with commercial software and
such system components as camcorders, NewTek's Video Toaster, genlocks,
sound cards and MIDI, 3DO, CD-I, CD-ROM, and touch-screen kiosks, in
addition to covering new developments in this fast growing industry.

Virtual Reality (VR) is in its infancy at the personal computer level, with
new technology promising to bring VR games to PCs in early 1994, although
commercial VR endeavors include shopping mall projects such as the
franchised parlor chains, Virtuality, and Paramount's "Star Trek: The Next
Generation." The Multimedia RoundTable will address developments in the VR
arena, providing current, indepth information for people interested in this
emerging technology.

Exciting Real-Time Conferences on the Multimedia RoundTable include:

  Virtual Reality on Wednesday, October 20th
  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
  David Whatley of Simutronics Inc., developer of GEnie's award-winning VR
  multi-player game, CyberStrike, and forthcoming producer of commercial
  PC VR software complete with 3D goggles.

  Video Production on Saturday, October 23rd
  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
  J. Michael Straczynski addressing computer graphics production for
  "Babylon 5," the Emmy award-winning TV series which uses Amiga Toasters.

  Desktop Video on Monday, October 25th
  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
  Lou Wallace, Editor of DeskTop Video World magazine, speaking on trends.

  Multimedia: Coming Soon (Late October or early November)
  """""""""""""""""""""""
  Noah Falstein, 3DO Company Producer, addressing 3DO Multimedia!

These exciting live Conferences begin at 10PM Eastern time in the Multimedia
RoundTable's Real-Time Conference area on GEnie Page 2000, menu option 2.
Type CYBERSPACE to get there!

A Software Library of shareware and freely distributable multimedia, desktop
video, and VR programs, commercial demos, graphics and audio support files
with conversion utilities for various platforms, is open on the Multimedia
RoundTable now. Weekly Cyberspace Reports similar to the *StarShip* 5-MINUTE
Weekend News will commence shortly.

(______/evWare, Inc., the California-based direct publisher and distributor
of software and videotapes for the Amiga, announced that it has released PC
Task Version 2.0 for the Amiga.

PC Task V2.0 is the only available software-only MD-DOS emulator for the
Amiga which will do VGA emulation. It will do Super-VGA emulation with AGA
Amigas. The list price is $49.95.

PC Task V2.0 will run most MS-DOS software on an Amiga. Since it is a
software emulator, it is not as fast as a bridgeboard, but makes up for it by
costing hundreds of dollars less. It will turn Amiga floppy drives into
MS-DOS-compatible drives and will use extra Amiga memory as PC memory.

Consistent with DevWare's product marketing philosophy of offering the best
product values for end users, it is feature-laden, unique, and lower-priced
than any competing product.

(______/evWare, Inc., the California-based direct publisher and distributor
of software and videotapes for the Amiga, announced that it was released
Piano Tutor for the Amiga.

Piano Tutor allows the user to acquire an amazingly rapid mastery of the
blues, jazz, improvisional and other modern music forms. It has a list price
of $29.95.

Consistent with DevWare's product marketing philosophy of offering the best
product values for end users, it is feature laden, unique and lower-priced
than any competing product.

Piano Tutor is a structured, rhythmic system of learning how to play true,
modern music keyboard utilizing left-hand bass patterns with varied chordal
progressions. It is MIDI-based and utilizes the user's own sequencer (which
must read standard MIDI files), providing a familiar interface and also a
ready means for recording progress.

The program makes each step of the process simple -- so the user can quickly
absorb the information and play actual pieces. Instead of bogging down in the
boredom of leangthy practice sessions, the user will be constantly rewarded
with the success of producing real music.

When the user completes the Piano Tutor course, he or she will have a real
grasp of basic piano theory and blues, jazz, improv and other harmonies.

Piano Tutor was developed by Cal Media and is the first and foundation disk
in a series. Future disks will have more advanced playing and genres of
music. It is easy to use and works with all current Amigas and versions of
AmigaDOS.

DevWare will market Piano Tutor to end users and dealers worldwide through
its DevWare ToolChest division.

"We had always thought that this was an excellent program that could stand
the test of time," said Ken Blakeman, Vice President of DevWare. "In order to

System for Decks (original list price $99.95).

Both versions include capabilities to do a 20-acre drawing area, over 300,000
layers, accuracy to 1/60th inch, and to support buildings over 200 stories
high.

Other highlights are:

 * Drawing features which include PAN, ZOOM, ROTATE, COPY, ADD TEXT,
   AUTO-DIMENSIONING, UNDO and TOPOGRAPHY.

 * Automatically generates wire frame FRONT, READ, and SIDE elevations.
 * Spreadsheet-style cost editor. Calculates material, labor and
   overhead costs.
