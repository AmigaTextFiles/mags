Commodore stock was the biggest winner on the New York Stock Exchange on
Thursday with a sudden 44% rise in price. Surprising everyone who has been
quietly watching CBU stand still for the past month or so as everyone
waited for the 4th quarter reports to be filed, the *StarShip* 5-MINUTE
News wondered what in the world precipitated this wild flux and huge
volume.

Was the fourth quarter report about to be released?
   - Well, as of noon today, no sign of it anywhere, and Commodore's
     comment to us, as well as national wire services has been "No Comment"
     when asked where the report was.

Did the final steps in the Commodore Shareholder Movement have an impact?
   - Studying the release of other information files from these folks who
     are working at trying to change some of Commodore's management with
     proxy votes and shares, I'd have to say that *no* correlation could
     be found previous to this. You can read the latest and likely one of
     the last opportunities to participate in this in J.YEAGER5's upload
     of CSMQ&A.LHA, File# 21463.

Did Commodore know why the stock was suddenly one of the biggest movers on
Wall Street?
   - Their only comment was "No Comment" to the total turnover of over
     5.7 million shares on Thursday, bringing Thursday's high of the stock
     up to 4 and a half.  Commodore stock hasn't traded above four since
     they released the 3rd quarter reports at the end of May.

So what happened?
   - Your guess is as good as ours.  But as this newscast is finalized
     today, Friday afternoon, Commodore's stock is still above 4, but
     down a bit.

Stay tuned. We will be watching.

              London Transport Museum Uses Amiga CD32 System
    _         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \         Newsbytes News Network, London -- 3 Nov 1993
  / - \
 / ___ \
(_/   \_)s part of an innovative UKP4 million redisplay, The London
Transport Museum (LTM) has introduced a Commodore Amiga CD32-based
audio-visual computer-based system.

The museum claims that the system has allowed it to move to state-of-the-art
interpretation techniques, to communicate effectively with their visitors
and, in particular, to use to the full, the wealth of imagery and data at
their command which cannot be presented in conventional displays.

At the heart of many of the new displays is the Commodore CD32, a CD-ROM
equipped computer system. The LTM claims that the machine's high quality
graphics, double-speed CD-ROM drive, 32-bit processor and custom display
hardware provide the ideal platform for audio visual and interactive
displays (AVID's).

When completed, as many as 109 CD32's will be used to provide interactive
information, video, animations, interactive sound effects, display control,
and background sound effect. Plans call for all the machines to be networked
together using an expansion system currently being developed by Index
Information, the company producing all the computer displays.

"We plan to take this opportunity to introduce new methods of interpreting
the collection, using the latest developments in design, graphics, audio
visual and interactive displays," explained Rob Lansdown, head of LTM's
communications and display.

According to Lansdown, the computer system has allowed the museum to tell
the 200 year story of London's urban public transport. "We have taken the
linear, chronological, sequence of story panels off the walls and associated
them directly with the objects in the collection," he said. "In this
non-linear, object oriented approach we will create 'islands' of interest
and ensure that the vehicles and other original material tell the story."

"The visitor becomes free to explore the Museum, its collection and stories
in a non-linear way, letting their own particular interest lead them around
the Museum. Visitors will choose their own priorities and interests,
navigating between the principle story 'islands' to follow say, a social
history or a technological theme," he explained.

According to Lansdown. the multimedia world has already experimented with
the idea of a "Hyper-Museum" in the form of a virtual museum on videodisc,
CD-ROM, and hard disk.

"The intention is to take this concept one step further. We want to take
this Hyper-media and use it to go beyond the database to interact with and
interpret a real museum. Instead of being shown images of the collection as
you Hyper-link around the disc, we will take you to the actual objects!," he
said.

In the real object-based Museum the visitor is free to wander through the
displays, dipping into the electronic HyperMuseum when they want to. As the
Museum's core displays will also be written in a non-linear style, the
electronic sections will form an integral part of the whole interpretation,
adding a further dimension to the visitor's experience, Lansdown explained.

"Many of the qualities that will make the CD32 such a successful home
entertainment system also make it the ideal commercial multimedia player,"
said Mick Tinker, technical director of Index Information, the developers of
the museum system. "A high quality and low cost delivery unit combined with
a powerful development platform is allowing us to provide advanced displays
at much lower costs than competitive systems," he added.

Tinker said that the company has had a very positive response from early
demonstrations of the projects. "We feel that the concept will attract the
attention of museums and visitors from around the world," he said.

"One of the new underground train simulators was shown at an exhibition and
ever since the museum has been receiving regular requests from companies
wishing to hire the display for their own exhibition stands," he added.

Index Information claims to be one of the major commercial developers of
Amiga- and CD32-based custom software and graphics applications for a wide
range of interactive multimedia and broadcast graphics displays.

Formed in January 1991, the company is rapidly expanding and currently has
eight staff, supplemented by additional experts and consultants as required.
Current and previous customers have included the London Transport Museum,
British Telecom (for the CD-ROM Interface), BBC Scotland (for the Catchword
game show software), and the Amiga Center Scotland (for the Harlequin
graphics card software).

The London Transport Museum first opened its doors in 1980, in the former
Covent Garden Flower Market. Since then, the museum has been at the center
of the renaissance of Covent Garden as one of London's liveliest places.

(____/itmap is putting together a new disk magazine, and has put out a call
for authors and artists. Everyone interested in 2D & 3D graphics and
animation on Amiga is welcome to send in their reviews, tips, tutorials,
images, objects, ARexx scripts, etc., to this new magazine in Leeds,
England.

Their aim is to give everyone who submits material maximum exposure. When
you send in your material, please remember to include your contact address
and a note about what you do. The magazine will be distributed in NTSC-
compatible format so that people on the other side of the pond can read it
without problems. Bitmap also says that they plan on publishing a freely
distributable collection of images in JPEG format on Amiga, PC and Macintosh
disks. They'll contain text files describing images and ways to get in touch
with the artists and authors. Jacek Artymiak, editor says, "We plan to put
them into PC and Macintosh PD libraries to spread as far as possible."

Please note that the magazine will be distributed on electronic networks,
via PD libraries etc., and Bitmap cannot guarantee that your copyright will
be respected. But you _should_ include copyright notice anyway. In response
to mail from people concerned about their copyright, Jacek explains,
"Everyone who submits material will be acknowleged and their work treated as
freely distributable, i.e. authors retain full copyright. We (Jacek &
Kathrin) are merely organizing incoming files."

           RGB Computer & Video announces third-quarter results
    ____   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / _  )        Riviera Beach, FL -- November 2, 1993
  /  __/
 / . \
(_/ \_)GB Computer & Video, Inc. (NASDAQ-EDIT), Amiga Video systems
developer, today reported its results for the third quarter ended September
30, 1993.

Sales for the third quarter of 1993 decreased to $688,156 from $724,240 in
the prior year's comparable period.  Gross profit, net of costs of sales,
increased to $370,857 from $358,151.  The Company reported a net loss of
$307,035, or $0.10 per share, down from net income of $50,675, or $0.03 per
share, in the similar period in 1992. The per share loss in the current
period was based on a weighted average number of shares of 3,216,705 as
compared to 1,865,032 shares for the comparable period in 1992.

For the nine months ended September 30, 1993, sales increased 47 percent to
$2,939,782 from $1,996,817 in the prior year's comparable period.  Gross
profit, net of costs of sales, increased to $2,028,971 from $970,604, an
increase of $1,058,367.

Income from operations was $16,691 versus income of $175,857. Net income wa
$8,170 or less than one cent per share compared with $124,729, or $0.07 per
share in the prior period last year.

Steven M. Crane, President, stated "The Company's marketing activities for
this period were adversely affected due to the problems associated with the
availability of the Commodore Amiga 4000 and the introduction of an
Amiga-based video editing system from Pride Integrated Services, Inc.
("Pride")."

Throughout the third quarter, the Commodore Amiga 4000 was delayed from
shipping in quantities sufficient to meet overall market demand.  During
the same period, Pride unexpectedly introduced a video editing system at
one-half the price of the Company's products. As stated in the Company's
press release of October 25th, suit was filed in Federal Court against
Pride and Rodion Molina, a former Company employee.  It is the Company's
contention that Molina stole the Company's AmiLink source code for use in
Pride's video editing system.  Based on advice from counsel, the Company is
confident that it will be successful in its efforts to prevent Pride from
competing with its products in the future.

As the Company enters the fourth quarter, the Commodore Amiga 4000 is being
shipped in quantity which is having a favorable impact on current period
sales.  Additionally, the Company has recently introduced its new AmiLink
video editor running on the Microsoft Windows operating system and its
AmiLink CIP Editing System for the consumer, industrial and professional
marketplace. Initial response to both products has been excellent.
Incremental sales staffing should be completed soon, and the Company
expects increased sales activity as a result of expanded marketing efforts
during the period. The Company was significantly restructured during the
period, including the creation of a service division devoted to creating
additional revenue and cash flow opportunities through sales of services to
a customer installed base of over 5,000 systems and 150 dealerships.

"We expect these new products and activities will have a significant
positive impact on revenues in the foreseeable future," said Crane.

RGB Computer & Video, Inc., assembles, markets and sells personal
computer-based video editing systems under the trade name AmiLink.

                  Psygnosis Announces New Game: Prime Mover
    ____          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / _  )            Cambridge, MA -- October 29, 1993
  / ___/

(_/ rime Mover is not just a motorcycle racing game.  The game's playability
sets it apart from all others. Prime Mover has been painstakingly developed
to provide a unique computer racing experience.

The developers at Psygnosis have dedicated considerable research time into
isolating the factors that make racing games so playable - factors such as
fluid graphics, cornering, and reducing 'stumbling' (the amount of time
spent floundering on off-track grassy sections).

Prime Move Features:

     - Five unique motorcycles with individual performance characteristics
     - Race in 12 different countries
     - 3.7 Megabytes of graphics
     - 18 Soundtracks
     - Fluid 50 frame per second animation

Look for the demo of Prime Mover, coming soon to the *StarShip*'s Software
Library.

Prime Mover will work with any Amiga model with at least 1MB RAM (512K CHIP
or greater.) Suggested retail price is $49.95, and will be available from
Amiga dealers or directly from Psygnosis.

For more information, contact Psygnosis, Ltd, 675 Massachusetts Ave.,
Cambridge, MA 01239, (800) 438-7794 (for orders) or (617) 497-7794 for
