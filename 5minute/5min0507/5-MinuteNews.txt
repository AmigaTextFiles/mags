(___)(__)elm, from Eagle Tree Software, is both an authoring system and a
powerful graphics program. It combines draw, paint, and image processing
tools with a scripting language, a hypermedia database manager, and a rich
assortment of user interface objects.

In Helm, you create objects directly on the pages of electronic books. You
work on the page, attaching actions or scripts to the objects. You can
immediately test your application as you work out the design. You focus on
your application and not on the intricacies of the authoring sytem. And with
Helm's paint and draw tools, you do not have to switch to outside programs to
create or modify your artwork.

Helm's Object Features

PAGES - Place objects on the pages of an interactive book. Each page can have
several CAD-style layers of objects that you can hide or show as you browse
through the book.

FORMS - You can use a form to create a common background for a group of
pages. The form also defines the resolution and number of colors for a set of
pages.

BUTTONS - Customize buttons with different borders, colors, patterns, fonts
and shadows.

CHARTS - Choose from bar, column, line, area and pie charts.

IMAGEFIELDS - Imagefields are like miniature paint programs. They support
animations, scrolling, and transparent backgrounds. If you lock an
Imagefield, you can use it as a button that the user can highlight or animate
with a click of a mouse button. If you unlock an imagefield, you can use
Helm's extensive paint tools to edit the image.

SHAPES - Boxes, ellipses, lines, curves, arrows, regular and irregular
polygons. Save memory and increase speed by using shapes instead of bitmap
images.

TEXTFIELDS - Change font, color, or style any number of times within a
textfield. Textfields support color fonts, transparent backgrounds,
scrolling, proportional fonts, and hypertext.

SELECTORS - Selectors are self-contained control panels that Helm can create
and manage. To use a selector, you only have to decide where to put it and
what choices it should give the user. Helm handles the rest.

  Here is a list of Helm's types of selectors:

  Selector           Description
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Pop-up Menu        Toggle an item using the menu button
  Cycle              Toggle through a list of items
  Check Box          Select multiple items by clicking buttons
  Multiple Choice    Select multiple options by clicking buttons
  Single Choice      Toggle an item in a list by clicking a button
  Radio Box          Toggle an item in a list by clicking a radio button
  Slider             Select a number by moving a knob
  Item Slider        Select an item in a list using a slider
  Palette            Choose a color from a set of color buttons
  Scrolling List     Toggle an item in a list
  Matrix             Enter numbers into a table of textfields
  Number             Select a number with up and down buttons
  Clock              Display the time in 12 or 24 hour format
  Date               Display the date in a variety of formats
  File               Select a file with a special scrolling list
  Information        Displays things like current page number

ACTIONS - You can program a book with just the mouse by attaching lists of
actions to objects. The user triggers these actions by selecting the object
with the mouse or keyboard.

  Here is a list of Helm's preprogrammed actions:

  Action             Description
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Go To              Turns to a specified page in any book
  Narration          Reads text using the Amiga narrator device
  Music              Plays a SMUS file
  Musical Notes      Plays text notes from classical notation
  Sound              Plays an 8SVX file
  Picture            Shows an IFF image or animation
  Text               Displays a text file
  Layers             Changes the visibility of an object layer
  Visibility         Changes the visibility of specified objects
  Move               Moves an object on a page
  Helm Command       Executes a default menu command
  Execute            Calls an external program or an ARexx script
  Touch Tones        Dials a phone number
  Serial             Sends data to a serial port
  Test Pattern       Shows bars used to adjust video output
  CDTV Audio         Plays a regular CD audio disc
  Genlock            Controls a 2.0 genlock
  Flip               Changes the frames in an imagefield animation
  Scroll             Scrolls the text in a textfield up or down
  Blackboard         Displays a help requester

SCRIPTS - For more advanced applications, there is a full-featured scripting
language with an English-like syntax. You can modify the attributes or
contents of any object with the scripting language.

Helm's Image Editing Features

PAINT TOOLS - Ellipses, irregular polygons, stars, rays, curves and an
adjustable air brush.

CUSTOM BRUSHES - Create brushes with a rectangle or any paint tool. Rotate,
shear, flip, remap and size brushes.

PAINT TYPES - Matte, Color, Replace, Tint, Smooth, Dissolve, Smudge,
Gradient, Chaos, Sample, Edge, Custom and more.

SUPPORT FOR AGA MODES - Helm's paint tools work in the 8-bit display modes
that are available on AGA computers.

Helm's Other Features

PRINTING - Send books, pages, images, text or reports to a PostScript device
or an Amiga-supported printer.

IMPORTING - For easy distribution, Helm can import sound (8SVX), music
(SMUS), images (ILBM), animations (ANIM-5), and Amiga fonts directly into a
book. Helm uses a file format that is similar to IFF but includes changes
that allow random access.

VISUAL EFFECTS - Many different effects including fades, dissolves, scrolls,
slides and wipes. Use effects when turning pages or changing the visibility
of objects or layers.

AUTOBROWSING - Instead of using the mouse or keyboard, you can browse through
a book using a timer or a joystick.

COMPATIBILITY - Compatible with PAL systems. It also supports ECS and AGA
display modes. Full support for the clipboard.

EXTRAS - The Helm package includes a 340 page manual (8.5" x 11") and five
disks of books and clip art. The books include World Flags, Chinese Signs,
French Flash Cards, Conversion, Atlas, Calendar, Periodic Table, Classic
Cars, Latin Phrases, Animated Buttons, Storyboard, Baby Paint, Bear Book and
Phonebook.

     _       Address It! and Invoice It! from Legendary Design
    / )      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / /          Brantford, Ontario, Canada -- May 6, 1993
  / /
 / (_
(____)egendary Design Technologies in March began shipping their first
commercial Amiga product, Address It!, priced at $39.95 U.S.

Address It! is an easy to use personal information manager. It can store up
to 5000 names and addresses per file, including comments, three phone number
fields, birthday, and a user-definable field.

Address It! does more than just store names and addresses though. Through its
powerful search and tagging facilities, you can categorize people in up to 15
separate fields and print custom lists with just the people you want in them.
You can print roster lists, envelopes, labels, rotary cards, and address
books. It supports all Preferences printers, and has special support for PCL
printers like the HP LaserJet and HP InkJet and other compatible printers.

Address It! will also easily integrate with both ProWrite and WordPerfect,
creating mail merge lists automaticaly. It will also output and input ASCII,
allowing you to integrate with virtually any other data base and word
processor.

"I think it's about time the Amiga market has some more powerful, yet
affordable, productivity software, and Address It! is our first step. We
don't plan on stopping there," says Syd Bolton, President of Legendary Design
Technologies. "We've researched what's available for both the Apple Macintosh
and IBM PC systems. Address It! is just as powerful (if not more so) than
what both of these platforms have to offer, and costs a lot less."

Address It! works with as little as 512K memory, and is compatible with Amiga
OS 1.2/1.3, 2.0 and 3.0.

Legendary Technologies is already working on several new products that will
complement Address It!. First, Invoice It! (see below) will bring low cost,
simple invoicing softare to the Amiga for those who use their Amiga in a
small business environment. Count It! is inventory control that can be used
in the home for insurance purposes, or again in a small busines environment.
All three products will integrate with each other but will also work
separately. For example, in Invoice It!, you can call up a customer from
Address It!, and sell them an item that is taken out of inventory from Count
It!. The products will all be available separately at first, and then as a
bundle.

Invoice It!

Finally! Inexpensive and powerful invoicing software available for the Amiga!
If you're tired of trying to find decent productivity software for your
Amiga, the wait is over. Invoice It! is just one of several products that
Legendary Design Technologies is creating. Whether you are joining the ranks
of the self-employed, run a thriving small business, or just need to make up
invoices on occasion for "on the side" work, Invoice It! is the package for
you.

First, you'l be surprised how affordable it is. Invoice It! retails for
$49.95 US and $59.95 Canadian. Then you'll be amazed at how powerful it is.

With Invoice It! you can:

 o Create files limited only by disk space
 o Automatically create Quotations and convert them into actual invoices
   with ONE mouse click!
 o Flexibility in handling two tax rates, compounding, and rounding
 o Design your own invoice layout
 o Print the following:
    Registers
    Accounts Receivable Reports
    Invoice Summary / Detail
    Customer Summary / Detail
    Cash Receipt Summary / Detail
    Trend Reports
 o Apply discounts
 o Supports laser, dot-matrix, and ink-jet printers
 o Mouse oriented line operations like cut/copy/paste make editing simple
 o Export information into your spreadsheet for further analysis and graph
   printing
 o Custom lists reduce typing for common entries
 o Account aging handled automatically
 o Extremely easy to use!

Address It! is presently available in the U.S. through CREATIVE COMPUTERS in
California, and SAFE HARBOR COMPUTERS in Wisconsin. Additionally, all
products are available directly from Legendary Technologies by check, money
order, Visa or Mastercard. Invoice It! will be shipping within days.

According to Syd Bolton, Legendary is strongly committed toward developing a
new wave of high-quality productivity software for the Amiga. In addition to
Address It! and Invoice It! (both of which will have even higher level
versions), they will be introducing an inventory package (as yet unnamed), as
well as some conversion utility packs that will include much needed text
conversion (i.e. convert WordPerfect 5.1 IBM files to ProWrite 3.3). They
also have other products in store including PLUS versions of Address It! and
Invoice It! that will work together through the power of ARexx to create the
following situation:

Customer runs a script that has Invoice It! PLUS create an Accounts
Receivable report. For all accounts older than 30 days (or user-specified),
Address It! PLUS gets those records, writes a form letter which includes
name, address, amount owing and number of days old. The form letters are
printed, followed by envelopes or mailing labels to complete the process. All
automatic.

Based in Brantford, Ontario, Canada, Legendary Design Technologies has been
incorporated since 1989. Although Address It! is their first commercial
release, they have released several programs as "Freely Distributable" on the
Fish Disks including: Prism 1.4, StripANSI, Screen Jaeger, Screen Mod, and
VS2PR. Legendary has also been involved in the production of software on
other platforms, and also in Amiga graphics for local cable stations.

Avenue, Brantford, Ontario, CANADA N3R 3B7, telephone 519/753-6120, fax,

(_/-Basic from Delphi Noetic Systems, Inc., is an enhanced, compiled language
system sporting the power of C with the ease of learning that comes from
BASIC. The Version 5.0 upgrade is the fourth major upgrade to F-Basic since
its debut in 1988. It supports extensive control structures, recursive
subprograms, global and local variables, extended integer variables, fast
9-digit single precision real numbers, IEEE double precision real numbers,
and text variables. It also supports record structures and pointers, high
level access to Amiga graphics, sound, menues, the ROM Kernal and more.
Version 2.0 added animation, IFF picture file reader/writer, icons, random
access files, and the Linker. Version 3.0 added an integrated editor
environment, direct 68020/030 and coprocessor support, IFF sound file player,
user-defined operations on record structures (object oriented programming), a
built-in matrix package, a built-in complex number package, and even FASTER
code. Version 4.0 added an ARexx port and interface, high level gadgets,
additional mouse support, separately compiled modules, safety program
checksumming, an improved editor, 68040 support, and a code optimizer.

Version 5.0 now adds access to all screen modes of the ECS and AGA chip sets,
PAL support, advanced support for serial device telecommunications, user
defined font support, a re-written editor environment, among dozens more.
F-Basic Version 5.0 is AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0 compatible, and runs on
ALL Amiga platforms. Sold with Version 5.0 of the F-Basic System Source Level
DeBugger (SLDB) for $159.95. Sold without the SLDB for $99.95.

F-Basic Source Level DeBugger (SLDB) 5.0 Now Available

Finally! A resource to help you quickly find and eliminate software bugs in
your code! The SLDB functions in a fully windowed Intuition interface, and
allows the user of an F-Basic 5.0 program to debug at the SOURCE level. A
knowledge of assembly language is not necessary to use the SLDB. The SLDB
allows the user to set breakpoints on source lines of the program to halt
execution, trace one source line at a time, go until breakpoint, etc. It also
allows the same functions at the assembly level. Valuable debugging tool for
beginner or advanced programmer. Some features include viewing and altering
processor registers, memory, variables, arrays, and records by name. A full
featured reversed assembler is also included for the machine code enthusiast.
Version 5.0 adds many, many new features and full support of the ECS and AGA
chip sets and PAL modes. The SLDB includes a user's manual, and requires
F-Basic 5.0. It is AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0 compatible. Runs on all
Amiga platforms.

Upgrading to V5.0 for Current Program Owners

Upgrade notices have been sent to registered users and are required to be
returned for upgrading to Version 5.0. Upgrade cost is $19.95 including the
5.0 F-Basic Language System, 5.0 Upgrade Manual, 5.0 SLDB (for current
owners), and dozens more sample programs illustrating the new features. Users
who have not received their upgrade notices by May 15, 1993, should phone
DNS, Inc. at 605/348-0791.

F-Basic Version 5.0 adds these new features:

1. Full access to the Screen Modes of the ECS & AGA Chip Set - Originally,
F-Basic screens and windows were based upon the formats provided by the
original graphics hardware. With the 5.0 release, F-Basic supports an
additional extended SCREEN statement, which allows the user to select from a
palette of the large number of screen modes supported by the operating
system. Increased screen resolution, depth, and number of colors available
are immediate enhancements to your F-Basic prorams.

2. Overscan & PAL Support - Each of the four Overscan types (Text, Standard
Max, and Video) are now available with F-Basic screens and windows. This
allows larger portions of the display screen to be accessible for the
rendering of text or graphics. Also, new F-Basic 5.0 screens support PAL
formats for European users of the system.

3. User Defined Font Support - This upgrade provides high level commands for
installing new fonts. These permit printing with different fonts and colors
within the same F-Basic window and greatly enhance the graphical interface
capabilities of the language.

4. Pinpoint Control of Print Statements - Version 5.0 adds a new PRINT
function that allows text to be positioned beginning at any pixel location
within the window. This complements the current PRINT command that works with
cursor locations.

5. WINDOW_RESIZE Event - Instantly respond to the use of a window's sizing
gadget within the familiar and convenient F-Basic event block syntax.
Additionally, new commands are available in 5.0 to sense the pixel width and
height of the current font, as well as the number of characters per line and
number of lines available in the current window. This allows easy rendering
of text and graphics into a window whose size may arbitrarily change.

6. SERIAL Event - Receive data from the serial port without syspending
execution or 'busy' wait loops. This F-Basic event block addition makes
telecommunications programs amazingly simple. In addition, 5.0 adds high
level commands which may be used to change the characteristics of the serial
port, such as baud rate, parity, the type of error checking used, etc.

7. New "Look" For the Editor & SLDB - The 5.0 Editor and SLDB take advantage
of the new graphical innovations in the language to produce a very pleasant
integrated environment to develop within. As always, any other text editor
may also be used in conjunction with F-Basic Version 5.0.

There are many more upgrades, including code enhancements and 'bug fixes.'
This is the  most complete F-Basic ever, and its graphical capabilities are
now unsurpassed. Version 5.0 of the SLDB is also now available, itself packed
with many new features.

F-Basic 5.9 is AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0 compatible and runs on all
Amiga platforms and accelerators, including the A500, 600, 1000, 1200, 2500,
3000 and 4000.

(____/teve Worley, author of the definitive book about Impulse's Imagine,
says that "Understanding Imagine" has been out of print for several months
since Impulse had told him that Imagine 3.0 would be available early this
year. Says Worley, "I had planned to write a new edition of Understanding
Imagine (UI) including all the new features, and didn't want to be stuck with
thousands of obsolete copies of UI 2.0. Anyway, I finally gave up waiting for
3.0, and did a reprint last month. There are now loads of copies available."

This fine book can be ordered by credit card from Apex by calling
415/322-7532 between the hours of 10AM and 6PM Pacific time. Calls will be
answered by a courteous, intelligent and Imagine-literate salesperson who
will be glad to help you, Steve Worley himself. :-) Fax orders may be placed
