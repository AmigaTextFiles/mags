 ___) )
(____/tarShip member Gary Goldberg reports that after taping "Dune" last
Saturday night on the Science Fiction (cable) Channel, he watched an
approximately 10-minute short following it called "Roboflight." In LARGE
TYPE, the credits for Roboflight noted that all the computer graphics were
done on the Amiga personal computer!


As reported by *StarShip* member Omar Siddique on the Bulletin Board earlier
this month, the September 13th issue of Business Week magazine included
reasonably favorable mention of Commodore's new Amiga CD32 console in their
Bits&Bytes column, mentioning that it had been introduced (in the U.S.) on
September 10th.


And here's an interesting find posted by Denny Atkin on the *StarShip*
Bulletin Board:

I just got a flyer for Sights&Sounds, a videotape technology magazine. One of
the products covered is "Media Magician" from User Interface Technologies. It
says it's a "friendly interface that lets you control virtually every system
in your house -- from lighting and HVAC to jacuzzis and your home theater --
using just one remote. You can even control all these systems through your
telephone! Simple menus make Media Magician easy to operate and install. And
because the system is CD-ROM based, it will never be obsolete!"

(And if you believe that last sentence, I've got some property you might be
interested in...)

Anyway, the reason this is interesting is that the remote control pictured,
although it has a UIT logo, is a _CDTV_ remote. Add that in with the CD-ROM
reference, and I think we've found one of Commodore's CDTV OEM resellers.

The ad lists the phone number 714/659-4580, if anyone is interested.

           Lightwave 3D Without the Toaster? Solution: Lightrave!
 _        _~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
( \  /\  / )         Richmond, VA -- September 1993
 \ \/  \/ /
  \      /
   \_/\_/arm and Fuzzy Logic, Inc. announced their solution for the Amiga(tm)
computer which allows you to use NewTek's Lightwave 3D(tm) animation system
without the Video Toaster(tm). The product is Lightrave - an all new hardware
device that resides on the serial port of ANY Amiga computer and emulates the
necessary Toaster functions that allow Lightwave(tm) to fully function on
your Amiga!

Features:

HIGH SPEED EMULATION: Lightrave is a custom hardware module that emulates all
of the Toaster functions needed by Lightwave 3D!

TOASTER FREEDOM: Lightrave enables any Amiga to run Lightwave 3D without
requiring a Video Toaster to be installed.

NEW ADVANCED FEATURES: Lightrave adds a suite of professional features never
before available to Lightwave 3D users.

FASTER!!  Lightrave will render images faster than a Toaster equipped Amiga,
as no lengthy display time to the Video Toaster is required.

TRUE 24 BIT DISPLAY: Rendering is no longer limited to the Toaster's
composite display alone. Lightrave now allows Lightwave 3D to render directly
to the most popular 24bit graphic cards. Supported cards include the GVP
IV-24, Retina, Opalvision, DCTV, Firecracker, EGS Spectrum, Piccolo, Picasso,
Rainbow 3, Amiga, and Amiga-AGA displays.

PAL COMPATIBLE: Lightrave makes Lightwave 3D fully functional for European
PAL users.

FAST ANIMATIONS: Full screen preview animations previously only available on
the Toaster-4000(tm) are now available to all Lightwave 3D users. The
animations are stored in standard Amiga "Anim" animation formats and may be
transferred and edited by other Amiga programs. Direct rendering to DCTV and
OpalVision animation formats will be available shortly.

NETWORKING: Lightrave is fully network compatible. From the low cost Parnet
to the high end Ethernet solutions, Lightrave is the perfect solution for all
Lightwave 3D "Render Farms".

IMAGE PROCESSING: Render directly to GVP's ImageFX, where frames can be image
processed before being saved to disk!

FULLY COMPATIBLE: Works with the entire Amiga line of computers. Even the
Amiga 500 and the new Amiga 1200!

Requirements:

 o  Lightwave 3D 2.0 or 3.0 required.
 o  Compatible with all Commodore Amiga models, both NTSC and PAL.
 o  Workbench and Kickstart 2.04 or later.
 o  Lightwave 3D requires a minimum 512 chip RAM and 512k fast RAM.
 o  Extended memory and hardware acceleration are reccomended.
 o  2 Megs of Chip RAM is recommended for direct rendering to GVP IV-24.
 o  Lightrave registration requires a Toaster registration number.


Lightrave is shipping now and carries a suggested retail price of $499. Call
your dealer or distributor for availability and product information, or
contact Michael Vunck, President, Warm and Fuzzy Logic Inc. 2302 Marriot Road
Richmond, VA 23229.

              DevWare Video & Atomic Toaster Announce Merger
    ______    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / __   )            Poway, CA -- August 16, 1993
  / /  ) /
 / /__/ /
(______/evWare, Inc., the California based direct marketer and distributor of
software and videotapes for the Amiga, and the Atomic Toaster, the Salt Lake
City, Utah-based Video Toaster Systems dealer, seminar instructor, software
developer and video producer, have announced they will be joining forces to
bring Video Toaster systems and related add-on products to new customers not
being reached by other Video Toaster dealers.

This new merger will combine the respective strenghts of Atomic Toaster and
DevWare.

Atomic Toaster has been designing and configuring Video Toaster systems,
supporting the creative and technical needs of its customers, and conducting
innovative training seminars for its corporate and university clients since
late 1990. Over this period, they have learned that anyone can sell a product
or a group of products, but it is how all products work together in a system
that makes their customer's productions successful. This is why they came up
with the Atomic Toaster Catalog, the indispensible resource and reference
guide for the Video Toaster industry, produced the Audio Production For The
Video Toaster instructional video, and developed the first product in The
Scene Machine series, Crouton Tools.

DevWare Video, launched in late 1992 as a division of DevWare, has quickly
become the largest reseller of videotapes, books, and educational software
for North American Amiga users, and one of the largest resellers of
commercial software for animation, graphics and video purposes as well.

"Our concern was how we extend our abilities and gain entry into the
expanding Video Toaster industry, and be able to properly support the
products we delivered to our customers," said Scott Pincus, President of
DevWare. "When we learned that Atomic Toaster wanted to expand their
business, it seemed like the perfect merger of our abilities."

"We knew that we were probably the greatest authority on how key software and
peripherals worked with the Video Toaster to become the most effective
systems for customers. Questions referred to us by NewTek and attendance at
our seminars were proof of that," said Harold Russell, President of Atomic
Toaster. "But we didn't have the capability to profitibly expand our
operations, and more importantly, handle the volume of business which would
result. DevWare offered us that solution with their marketing, distribution,
product purchasing, and fulfillment capabilities."

As a result of the merger, DevWare will market Crouton Tools, Audio
Production for the Video Toaster, the Atomic Toaster Catalog, future products
in The Scene Machine Series, and other new products developed by Atomic
Toaster through its DevWare Video division to end users, corporate and
university customers, and dealers. Atomic Toaster will provide creative
technical support, seminar training and continued development of The Scene
Machine modules and other products for the Video Toaster, as well as provide
technical support for other commercial software titles licensed by DevWare
Video.

DevWare, through its DevWare Video division, is an international licensor,
marketer and distributor of commercial software and instructional videotapes
relating to the Amiga computer and Desktop Video markets.

Atomic Toaster, located in Salt Lake City, Utah, has more than 20 years
experience in commercial video production and has been configuring Video
Toaster Systems for customers since the Video Toaster was first released.
Recently, they opened a California office to sell Video Toaster systems and
training seminars to corporate accounts and video producers in the greater
Los Angeles area.

DevWare is also a direct marketer of third-party Amiga software, hardware and
Public Domain for the Amiga and MS-DOS markets. Lower-priced niche software
licensing and distribution is done through its DevWare Toolchest division.

(______/evWare, Inc., the California based direct marketer and distributor of
software and videotapes for the Amiga, announced that it has acquired the
international rights to exclusively distribute CocoonMorph from Ironworker
Studios.

CocoonMorph is a fast, high quality, powerful morphing system for the Amiga
computer that is easy to learn and use. It includes high-end features found
in more expensive systems - without a Rolls Royce price! The list price of
CocoonMorph is $99.95.

The group of unique features found only in CocoonMorph are:

     * Built-in "virtual memory" to conserve RAM
     * Full control over the transition rate of each pixel using
       alpha channel images
     * Automatic variable level, transparent color compositing
     * Ability to composite with any background being transparent
     * Interface displays source and destination images in color
     * Automatic image scaling

CocoonMorph will load any IFF image, including AGA formats. You can save
frames as 24-bit, HAM, HAM-8, or 16-level grayscale. It also allows editing
of form and color transitions, with smooth curve fitting.

CocoonMorph works on any model Amiga with at least 3 MB of RAM or more. Eight
(8) MB are required to render high resolution morphs.

A hard drive is required with less than 4 MB of RAM, and highly recommended
otherwise.

DevWare will market CocoonMorph through its DevWare Video division. Atomic
Toaster, located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and now working with DevWare Video
as their Video Toaster sales and new product development division, will
provide technical support for CocoonMorph.

          DKB Displays Five New Products at World of Commodore Show
    ______~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / __   )           Wixom, MI -- September 1993
  / /  ) /
 / /__/ /
(______/KB, a leading manufacturer of hardware and software for the Commodore
Amiga line of computers, displayed five new products in their booth at the
World of Commodore Amiga Show in Pasadena, CA, earlier this month. This
dramatic expansion in DKB's product line is due in part to its new
rleationship with Helfrich, Internationa, which has namedd DKB the sole
distributor of its products in the United States, Canada, and Austrlia.

The DKB 3128 is the first high-capacity, 32-bit Zorro III memory board for
the Amiga 3000, 3000T, 4000, and 4000T computers. A single board allows users
to expand their total memory up to 146 megabytes -- enough to manipulate an
hour of CD-quality audio, hundreds of frames of full-color animation, or a
full-page scanned image in 24-bit color at 600 dpi. The DKB 3128 is versatile
as well as powerful. It accepts a wide variety of industry-standard 4 MB, 8
MB, 16 MB and 32 MB memory modules (SIMMs), and can use modules of varying
sizes at the same time.

DKB had two new graphics boards on display. The Piccolo is a high-
performance, low-cost display card for the Amiga 2000, 3000, and 4000 series
of computers. It increases both the size of the display (up to 1280x1024
pixels on an appropriate monitor), and the number of colors that can be
displayed at once (up to 16.7 million colors on any analog RGB monitor).
While affordably priced, the Piccolo still provides "state of the art"
features like a dual-speed bus (works at a slower speed for the 16-bit bus on
the Amiga 2000, but speeds up when plugged into the 32-bit bus on the Amiga
3000 or 4000), and automatic switching between the standard Amiga display and
the enhanced Piccolo display on a single monitor. The Video Layer is a 32-bit
display card for the Amiga 3000 or 4000 which provides up to 16.7 million
colors at video display resolutions (768x476 NTSC or 768x576 PAL). The board
can output either computer-style RGB video at 31.25 KHz horizontal, or
television-style video, NTSC or PAL composite or Y/C separated, at 15.75 KHz.
As its name suggest, the Video Layer board is able to merge graphics from its
own 24-bit color output, the native Amiga display, and external video source
into a single display, for a rich "layered" look. Both the Piccolo and the
Video Layer board use the industry-standard EGS libraries for compatibility,
and include TV-Paint Junior, the premier 24-bit paint package for the Amiga.

DKB also showed the first MPEG full-motion video products for the Amiga.
Peggy is a video decoder board which allows you to play full-motion 24-bit
video directly from storage devices like a CD-ROM or hard drive. Its
integrated genlock allows you to mix Amiga graphics and MPEG video on the
same screen. C-Cube's MPEG chip compression technology drastically reduces
the storage requirements, allowing you to play back minutes of video, not
seconds. And with the optional MPEG encoder software, you'll be able to
create your own ISO-standard MPEG movies.

DKB had a number of its current products on display at the World of Commodore
Amiga show, as well. These included the DKB 1202 memory board for the Amiga
1200, THE CLOCK, a clock calender card for the Amiga 1200, the DKB 2632
memory expansion board for the A2630 accelerator, and the MegAChip 2000/500,
the original graphics memory expansion board for the A500, A2000 and CDTV.
All of the current products and several of the new products were available
for sale at the show. DKB Software exhibited at the World of Commodore Amiga
show, both as an opportunity to present new products to the public, and to
meet its customers face-to-face. According to DKB President Dean Brown,
"We're in the business of solving problems for people, so it's as important
to hear what they have to say as it is to show them what we can do for them."

   / \           San Francisco, CA -- September 19, 1993
  / - \
 / ___ \
(_/   \_)t the World of Commodore AMIGA show in Pasadena I was offering for
the first time two packages of Compugraphic-style fonts. "70 NEW Compugraphic
Fonts for $40.00" & "70 More Compugraphic Fonts for $20". The first package
is 100% my original work, and the second set is conversions of BMUG shareware
fonts by other artists. These fonts work in PPage 3 or 4, PDraw 3, PageStream
2, and other programs, about 70% or so work with the 97 pound-weakling
CG-font-engine of Workbench 2/3.

I still have a few of these packages left for mail-order, but not many of
each, so hurry if you want them. Due to the user boycott of fonts products
distributors have ceased carrying my fonts products despite high praise in
reviews in AmigaWorld and other mags. It has become a cult item, word-of-
mouth. In exchange for fonts unlike you'll find in the "Me Too" copycat
collections that everybody sells over and over, these are unusual, different.
There are cartoonist & comicbook fonts, handwrite scripts (the hardest to
make, and that's why most companies stay away from trying), Western woodtype,
contemporary Condensed, invitation Fancy, many nice Deco styles and humorous
headline Novelty types.  You cannot find a larger collection.  You cannot
find a better selection, and ther are no places to go for lower prices.  As
the person who has made more Postscript fonts from scratch than any other
person in the world, and made more CG fonts than anybody who works at
Compugraphic, it's time you trust the World's Foremost Expert on Amiga Fonts!
