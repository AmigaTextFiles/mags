                  Migraph ColorBurst Color Hand Scanner

            Worth its weight in gold and 262,143 other colors!

(_/   \_)t last, a color hand scanner for Amiga Systems that's fast and
accurate and affordable. With the Migraph ColorBurst(tm) you can now produce
crisp, clear, vivid color images for all your video and multimedia projects,
on-screen presentations, and desktop publications. And have a lot of fun
doing it.

Speedy scanning. Great detail.

The ColorBurst's large scanning window -- more than fourinches wide --
provides fast, single-pass scanning. Six scannng resolutions from 50 to 400
dots per inch (dpi) let you scan images at the resolution best suited to your
chosen output device.

And five scanning modes give you the flexibility to work with color,
grayscale and black-&-white images, all with one scanner.

So you can produce exactly the image you need for the output option of your
choice: on-screen display, laser and Linotronic printouts, or slides.

Non-nonsense software.

The Migraph ColorBurst comes with easy-to-use imaging software for accurate,
efficient scanning. It picks up 262,144 brilliant colors in a single pass (or
4,096 colors if you're working on a lower-memory system).

The same software lets you quickly and easily save your image in a variety of
standard file formats, ready for direct export to video, graphics, and
desktop publishing applications.

So you can export images for use with the Toaster, for enhancement in a
program like Deluxe Paint, or for printing in publishing programs like
PageStream and Professional Page.

A Three-in-One Scanning Solution

Versatility is the ColorBurst's specialty. If the image you're after is
smaller than a full page -- whether it's a photo, ilustration, drawing, or
cartoon (or business card, postcard, Christmas card, or photo identity card)
-- you can scan it with the Migraph ColorBurst.

It's a color scanner when you need eye-catching color graphics. A grayscale
scanner when you need full-size, true-64-level grayscale images for
hassle-free, high-resolution printouts. And it's a monochrome scanner when
you need crisp, clear scans of line art or text for OCR processing.

With the Migraph ColorBurst, capturing high-resolution color (and grayscale
and monochrome) images has never been easier. Or more fun.

(_/ he ToasterFX framestore load, saver and render modules, and GVP's ImageFX
software are a complete paint and image processing package for NewTek's Video
Toaster.

Replacing ToasterPaint, GVP's ImageFX offers complete 24 bit painting tools
with an 8 bit alpha channel, airbrush tools, color balancing, composition
controls, special effects filters (oil paint, ripple, disperse, distort...),
morphing and more.

The ToasterFX LOAD module allows DIRECT loading of framestore files into
ImageFX as 24 bit images. View the ENTIRE image on screen while painting, or
choose any zoom level for detail work.

The ToasterFX SAVE module saves any image loader or created in ImageFX
directly to NewTek's framestore format.

Convert Video Toaster framestores DIRECTLY to and from Amiga IFF24, JPEG,
Targa, TIFF, GIF, Alias formats and more.

The RENDER module can directly display to the Video Toaster's framebuffers
without leaving the ImageFX interface. (choose between DV1 or DV2).

ToasterFX competely integrates the operation of ImageFX with the Video
Toaster, allowing direct access from the Toaster's switcher screen.

ToasterFX also includes stand-alone utilities for:

 o  Converting Framestores to IFF24 images
 o  Converting IFF24 images to Framestores
 o  Displaying any Amiga screen directly to a Toaster framebuffer

ToasterFX requires GVP's ImageFX for painting and image processing functions.
Painting and image processing can be acomplished on any Amiga computer.
NewTek's Video Toaster is required only for direct displaying of framestores
to the Toaster's framebuffers.

ToasterFX is available at your Video Toaster and Amiga Dealer, or directly
from: Byrd's Eye Software, 9001 Northgate Blvd, #135, Austin, TX 78758 (512)

       Children's Television Workshop Inks Deal with Electronic Arts
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   Electronic Arts to publish multi-platform
     ____    interactive media featuring Sesame Street characters
    / ___)
   / (_               San Mateo, CA -- April 1, 1993
  / ___)
 / (_
(____)lectronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) and Children's Television Workshop,
renowned leaders in their respective industries, today announced a long-term
exclusive agreement to produce interactive media on a number of platforms
including computers, video game machines, CD-ROM and the 3DO Interactive
Multiplayer(tm).

Under the agreement with CTW, Electronic Arts' new EA*KIDS(tm) division will
publish interactive media products for children featuring the Sesame
Street(R) characters.

"This is a powerful partnership," said Stewart Bonn, senior vice president of
the CD Group at Electronic Arts. "CTW practically invented the idea of
educating children through entertainment -- Sesame Street is the classic
example everyone would like to emulate," Bonn added.

"Electronic Arts has a successful track record in taking the 'high road' in
technology and is clearly a market leader for innovative media," said Rob
Madell, vice president for Interactive Technologies at CTW. "EA*KIDS shares
CTW's vision of creating interactive learning experiences for children all
over the world," added Madell.

"Electronic Arts and CTW have 35 years combined experience in producing media
and understanding kids," said Madell.

"CTW and Electronic Arts share a similar philosophy -- kids learn when
they're engaged, and engagement stems from open-ended discovery and creative
explorations. All of the products in this new Seasame Street line will
reflect this philosophy," added Bonn.

EA*KIDS is a division of Electronic Arts charged with creating enriching
software for kids ages 3 to 14 that captures the magic of childhood.
Electronic Arts has been a worldwide leader in developing and distributing
entertainment software for video game systems and computers for the past 10
years.

Children's Television Workshop was founded in 1968 to explore the use of
television to educate children. CTW has been producing entertaining,
educational software for the past 10 years. Today, CTW's mission extends over
television, print, outreach and software, and reaches children in over 80
countries. CTW is a not-for-profit organization with 501(c)3 tax exempt
status.

    ___  ___         R.A.W. Entertainment Goes Direct!
   (_  )(  _)        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    / /_/ /            Houston, TX -- March 26, 1993
   / __  /
 _/ / / /
(___)(__)aving spent two years listening to thousands of customers asking,
"Why can't I find RAW titles?" RAW Entertainment are going direct. They are
lowering their current $59.95 title SPOILS OF WAR to $34.95. All current
$49.95 titles will be lowered to $29.95. The ACTION STATIONS! SCENARIO/
UTILITY DISK will be lowered from $21.95 to $14.95. Both SPOILS OF WAR (PC
and Amiga) and FIRETEAM 2200 (PC only) will continue to be shipped with free
add-on disks.

RAW Entertainment, Inc., are in negotiation with other publishers, worldwide,
who may also join in on this new concept.

Products will only be available directly from RAW, credit card orders will be
accepted for the first time on their new 800 order-line: 1-800-323-7878.

RAW Entertainment will be the only publisher to stand by their titles by
offering a 30 day refund policy, which will include refunding their shipping
& handling charges! Given the quality of their current product range, they do
not worry greatly about massive returns!

RAW Entertainment believes their titles were good value for money before
these price reductions, but have lowered their prices in order to pass on
their cost savings to the customer, given these recessionary times (plus
energy taxes, sin taxes, increased corporation and income taxes!).

RAW Entertainment will now stand or fall on the quality of their products and
their customer service, both before and after the sale, rather than
continuing to wait for the retail/mail order sectors to provide the level of
service RAW Entertainment would like to.

It is believed that RAW Entertainment, Inc., are the only software house to
have STARTED by looking for retail distribution and ENDED UP going direct.
Most publishers seem to have operated the other way around. No one can say
RAW Entertainment are conventional! WATCH THIS SPACE..!

RAW "DIRECT" will go "LIVE" on May 1st 1993 with advertising commencing in
May/June.  For more information contact R.A.W. Entertainmnet, Inc., 957 NASA
Road One, Suite 146, Houston, TX 77058-3098, telephone 713/386-2386.
