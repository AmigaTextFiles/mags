        Entire Toaster Studio Can Be Controlled by New ASDG Product
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    ASDG announces the availability of T-Rexx Professional, Version 2.0.
    This user-expandable product comes ready to control nearly every
    facet of the NewTek Video Toaster plus 12 other hardware and software
    products. An entire studio can be integrated by T-Rexx Professional.

 / ___ \
(_/   \_)SDG Incorporated, the leading innovator in color imaging technology
for the Commodore Amiga, announce the availability of T-Rexx Professional
Version 2.0. T-Rexx is a system integration tool with special emphasis on the
NewTek Video Toaster.

Large collections of Toaster Framestore images can be previewed, managed,
browsed, and converted to IFF/RGB. All framestore operations, including the
conversion to and from IFF/RGB, are performed in full broadcast color without
requiring the Video Toaster hardware.

T-Rexx enables you to read and write custom Toaster effects (both ActionFX and
OrganicFX). You can turn an ANIM file into a Toaster effect, or take an
existing Toaster effect and turn it back into an ANIM file. T-Rexx even
includes high speed special effects processing which allows a single ANIM file
to create dozens of different Toaster effects.

And, of course, you can create and edit Toaster projects to build the Toaster
configuration which best meets your needs.

T-Rexx's scripting capabilities are unparalleled. ARexx scripts are displayed
in plain English and can be created and edited using a simple point-and-click
interface which requires no programming knowledge. You can create scripts for
any product which is ARexx, serial port, or parallel port controllable.

ARexx commands for different products can be freely combined giving users the
ability to merge the capabilities of multiple tools into a single application.
There's even a unique real-time mode which speeds script development by
allowing you to test the script (with instant feedback) as it is being
written.

Using T-Rexx, you can create interactive or automated multimedia presentations
by linking the Video Toaster to other hardware and software products. T-Rexx
comes with ready-made command sets for: AmiLink, Art Department Professional,
BCD-2000A, DQ-Taco, MediaPhile, MorphPlus, PC-VCR, Personal SFC II, Personal
TBC III, Pixel 3D, SunRize Studio 16, and VISCA.

T-Rexx Professional carries a suggested retail price of $249 and requires
Kickstart 2.0 and a minimum of 2 megabytes of system memory.

For more information about ASDG's color imaging solutions contact Gina
Cerniglia at ASDG Incorporated, 925 Stewart Street, Madison, WI 53713 or call
(608) 273-6585, or leave a message on the *StarShip* Bulletin Board in the
ASDG CATegory.

        CSA's 50 MHz Accelerator Solution to a Scuzzy (SCSI) Problem
    _   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \                 San Diego, CA -- April 1993
  / - \
 / ___ \
(_/   \_)miga 1200 owners are trapped and running out of time. Large image
files and long animations are filling up their hard drives. And there's no
room to grow.

Why? Because the A1200 doesn't work with currently available mass-storage
peripherals -- like floptical drives, removable media and multi-Gigabyte
replacement hard drives. All of these devices (along with CD-ROM drives, tape
backups and other high-tech add-ons) use a standard SCSI interface. The A1200
only provides an IDE interface for a single hard drive.

To solve this problem, CSA has developed the TwelveGuage, a 50 MHz accelerator
card for the A1200 that features -- you guessed it -- a SCSI interface. Now
you can use your A1200 with such devices as CD-ROM drives, Syquest removable
media drives, a wide choice of standard SCSI hard drives, floptical optical
drive systems and tape back-up systems, and hundreds of other SCSI compatible
add-ons.

Raw speed is another requirement for processor-intensive activities like
rendering, animation and desktop publishing. Built around a 50 MHz Motorola
68030 central processor, CSA's TwelveGuage runs 7 to 10 times faster than a
stock A1200 with its earlier-generation 14 MHz 68EC020.

In addition to its faster clock speed, the TwelveGuage also utilizes Burst
Mode for processing, a faster, more efficient way to manage the flow of data
from 32-bit memory.

The result: more completed projects, sooner than otherwise possible. For even
faster processing, the TwelveGuage also supports the addition of a 50 MHz
68882 math coprocessor.

In addition to its speed, CSA's TwelveGuage also goes a long way to ease the
necessary expense of adding memory. Instead of requiring expensive,
proprietary RAM chips, the TwelveGuage uses industry-standard A4000-type
32-bit SIMMS, which are less expensive. What's more, RAM upgrades can be made
in affordable stages (to 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 Megabytes).

CSA's TwelveGuage installs easily into the A1200 trap door slot and can be
ordered in several alternate configurations, depending on how much RAM you
need, and whether you need a math coprocessor. You could even order one
without the SCSI interface (if desired). A less expensive 40 MHz 68EC030-based
version can also be ordered.

Available in April 1993, CSA's TwelveGuage carries a retail price of $699
(with 50 MHz 68030, SCSI interface, 68882 socket and without RAM). Learn more
by contacting Computer System Associates, 7564 Trade Street, San Diego, CA
92121, telephone 619/566-3911, fax 619/566-0581.

CSA products are distributed internationally by: Ami-Tech (Australia), Eureka
(Netherlands), Omega House (Cheshire, England), Memory World (Bonsalom,
Pennsylvania), Memphis Computer Products (Rodheim, Germany) and Tricom
(Sweeden).

The Retina is also a true 24-bit display card! It can display 24-bit
resolutions up to 800x600 non-interlaced and greater than 1024x768 interlaced.

The Retina can run Workbench in high-resolution and have other programs
running on their own custom screen on the Retina AND still be used to display
24-bit graphics simultaneously. The Retina allows you to simply hotkey between
any screen currently running on the display! It gets even better, too. The
Retina installs into the standard zorro slot and does NOT use the video slot.
You can have up to FOUR Retinas installed in one computer.

The Retina is compatible with versions 2.0 and 3.0 of the Amiga operating
system.

The Retina is compatible with the Video Toaster for True 24-bit display.

 o 4MB allows double buffering for animations and screens larger than
   800x600 in 24-bit.
 o The Retina can have more than one 24-bit image in memory at the same time
   and you can toggle between screens. You can actually toggle between
   24-bit screens and 8-bit screens.
 o The Retina can be used to display 24-bit graphics while emulating
   Workbench.
 o XIPaint is a realtime 24-bit paint program that comes with the Retina to
   get you going in 24-bit quickly.

   14" through 21" monitors.
 o Replace your Flicker Fixer with a True High-Resolution Flicker Free
   Display Card.
 o Full Workbench Emulation with resolution such as 1024x768 or 1280x1024
   in 16 colors or even more! Up to 2400x1200! A few samples: 2400x1200,
   1900x1426, 1600x1200, 1280x1024, 1024x768, 800x600.
 o The Workbench display on the Retina at 1280x1024 in 16 colors can operate
   as fast or faster than the standard Amiga output of 724x482 in 16 colors!
   Display modes in both interlaced and non-interlaced.
 o The Retina allows you to specify the size that you want to use for
   Workbench and then you can use a different size for other programs that
   display on their own custom screens.
 o The Workbench can be set to a resolution of 1280x1024 non-interlaced and
   you could have AdPro running on its own screen at 320x200.
 o The Retina software has screen modes which are called groups. A group
   screenmode is used for programs that ask for a specific screen resolution
   when they start. If the group is selected then the Retina will open the
   program on its own screen at the resolution that it wants.
 o Any program can be selected in software to be displayed on the Retina
   output or the Amiga output.
 o You can change the output resolution for any program simply by choosing
   the program name and then selecting a different screen resolution for
   that program.

                   VLab Real-Time Video Digitizer Card
    _  _           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \/ \              Mt. Clemens, MI -- April 1993
  /      \
 / /\  /\ \
(_/  \/  \_)acroSystemUS announces the release of VLab(TM) -- RealTime Video
Digitizer for the Amiga computer. VLab digitizes a full frame in 1/30th of a
second or 1 field in 1/60th of a second. It digitizes in full color, NTSC or
PAL. It will save images as 24-bit, YUV, or any Amiga format including AA
modes like HAM8. (Saving the image in YUV retains all digitized information in
about half the space of 24-bit IFF files.)

Inputs
  2 Composite NTSC or PAL connectors
  Software selectable for either input

Allows you to grab sequences
  You can select the number of frames that you want to grab in series and
    the VLab will Framegrab them at up to six frames per second.
  The speed at which the VLab can grab frames in sequence is governed by
    many things of which some are the screen size that you select, the
    resolution that you select, as well as the speed of the computer that
    you are using.

The VLab will work in either the A2000, A3000 or A4000 series Amiga computers
  The VLab installs into any standard Amiga 100 pin slot and does not use
    the video slot
  There is also a VLab1200 that allows owners of the A500, A600 and the A1200
    to also use the VLab.

The VLab does not require a frame accurate video player to hold the image
    still to digitize. The VLab will in real-time digitize any frame from the
    video source that you have connected.
  You can digitize images from cable TV, Broadcast TV, VCR, Video Disk
    Players, and Video Cameras.

Software Support
  The VLab is supported by popular graphics software such as ASDG's Art
    Department Professional, Image Master by Black Belt, TVPaint by TechSoft.
  The VLab software allows you to do frame grabbing, sequencing and a
    certain amount of image manipulation. The software can switch between
    one of the two inputs. You can select the size of the grab that you want
    to perform. The software has built-in color, contrast, gamma, luminance
    and chrominance correction. The software also has luminance and
    chrominance filters.

There is a special monitor window that allows you to see the video signal that
you have attached to the VLab in a window on the VLab screen in up to 16 gray
scales at up to 15 frames per second. With the Retina display card you can
have the monitor in full screen in either grey scale or color.

The VLab software requires the 2.0 operating system or higher and is fully
ARexx compatible.

VLab is compatible with the Video Toaster, OpalVision, Retina, Harlequin. It
is also supported by the Nucleas Personal SFC.

Suggested retail price for the VLab is $499.95.

  / /
 / (__
(_____)entral Coast Software is pleased to announce our new Quarterback Tools
Deluxe package, and would like to extend an upgrade offer to all registered
Quarterback Tools users.

The all new Quarterback Tools Deluxe package includes Quarterback Tools
version 2.0. This is not just a cosmetic upgrade to Quarterback Tools, but a
totally revised and and rewritten program. We've completely rewritten
Quarterback Tools from the ground up, and added many new features:

File system.

Optimizing disks.

But there's more! In addition to the Quarterback Tools 2.0 program,
Quarterback Tools Deluxe includes several new programs -- programs that make
managing files and disks easier than ever before:

  Copies of a source disk, using up to four floppy drives simultaneously.
  You can even save an entire disk image as a file, and load it for later
  duplication.

  Individual drawers or entire disks for files that match a name or pattern
  you specify. For each file found, you can see the file's location,
  creation date, size, comments, and contents, so you can quickly determine
  if it is the file you are looking for.

  Encryptor, you can encrypt and decrypt your files using a password that
  only you know. People who don't have a file's password will not be able
  to read the file's contents.

  Portion of your disks, or the entire disk's contents. When a disk is
  erased with Disk Eraser, not even Quarterback Tools can recover the
  contents of the disk. There is no better way to make sure no one will be
  able to access your deleted files. There is even an option for using
  Department of Defense specifications when erasing!

When you erase a file with File Eraser, not even a program like Quarterback
Tools can recover the file's contents. And like Disk Eraser, File Eraser
includes an option for using Department of Defense specifications when
erasing.

  Need to press to type any character. An indispensable tool if you ever
  use special characters such as copyright symbols or accented characters.

  System files -- such as fonts, printer drivers, system libraries, and CLI
  commands -- from one disk to another. System Mover shows you version
  information of the files you are moving, so you can make sure you are

  Renders a floppy disk inaccessible from AmigaDOS--without affecting the
  contents of the disk! When a disk has a "Brain Cloud", not even the
  Amiga's "Format" command can affect the disk! Perfect for protecting your
  disks from inadvertent use by others.

With all these new features, Quarterback Tools Deluxe has a new suggested
retail price of $125.00. However, as a registered Quarterback Tools owner, you
can get the complete Quarterback Tools Deluxe package for only $40 plus
shipping -- a savings of $85 over the retail price.

Registered owners of Quarterback Tools will shortly be receiving an upgrade
notice in the mail. However, if you prefer, you can order your upgrade now for
faster response. Call us for details or to place an order (if you order the
upgrade over the phone using your VISA or MasterCard, you will need to have
your current Quarterback Tools disk handy, since we will need the registration
number from the back of the disk).

Quarterback Tools Deluxe will be shipping in late April/early May, and as
always upgrades are processed in the order they are received. We are sure you
will be as excited about this new package as we are!

 ___) )
(____/tymied gamers now have two new resources available from ORIGIN Systems
-- Ultima Underworld II Clue Book: Gems of Enlightenment, and Quest for Clues:
The Manual of Swords.

Gems of Enlightenment is the cluebook for ULTIMA Underworld II: Labyrinth of
Worlds. Like the game itself, much of the book takes place from a first-person
perspective. Inhabitants of each of the eight realms act as tour guides
through their worlds, offering hints and history. Gems of Enlightenment also
includes a description of the game's mechanics as well as a complete
walkthrough and player's checklist.

The Manual of Swords is the sixth installment of the Quest for Clues series.
The books are now bi-yearly publications released in the Spring and Fall to
cover the latest in entertainment software. Shay Addams and his formidable
QuestBusters Guild have once again uncovered tips and solutions for 20 of the
most popular adventure/action and roleplaying games, including ORIGIN'S ULTIMA
VII: The Black Gate and Forge of Virtue. The Manual of Swords contains
everything from system requirements to maps, walkthroughs, introductions and
reviews for each game. The unique QuestBuster code allows players to decipher
crucial words in the solution without revealing other key elements of the
game.

Other titles include:

  The Dagger of Amon Ra
  The Dark Half
  DarkSeed
  Dune
  Gobliiins
  Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis
  King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow
  Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2; Gas Pump Girls Meet the Pulsating
    Inconvenience from Planet X
  The Legend of kyrandia: Book One
  Lord of the Rings, Vol. II: The Two Towers
  The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Serrated Scalpel
  Might and Magic: Clouds of Xeen
  Plan 9 from Outer Space
  Planet's Edge: The Point of No Return
  Prophecy of the Shadow
  Quest for Glory III: Wages of War
  Spellcasting 301: Spring Break
  The Summoning
  Treasures of the Savage Frontier

The suggested retail price of Gems of Enlightement is $14.95. The suggested
retail price for The Manual of Swords is $16.95. Both books are available
through software distributors and major retail chains.
