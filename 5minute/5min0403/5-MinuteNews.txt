(_____)ommodore's exhibit and the Keynote Address today from Lew Eggebrecht,
Commodore International's Vice President of Engineering, are the hits of the
World of Commodore Show being held this weekend in New York City.

New products introduced at the show by Commodore include a Tower model of the
Amiga 4000 (A4000T), two new monitors (A1940 and A1942), and a new SCSI-2
Adaptor (A4091). They're demonstrating a partially-functioning MPEG board,
and, in his Keynote Address, Eggebrecht spoke at length of the long-awaited
Digital Signal Processor for AGA machines based on AT&T's 3210 DSP chip. He
also talked about new CD-ROM technology Commodore is developing, an AGA
"Display Enhancer" board that will tap directly into 24-bit video memory, and
two new AGA Chipsets designed for low- and high-end situations beginning in
1994. No pricing information was available for any these products.

Eggebrecht also announced that he met with NewTek today and the Video Toaster
WILL support the A4000 in the near future!

New Amiga 4000T

Along with exhibiting lots of regular goodies like the Amiga 4000, 1200, and
CDTV, the nicest thing Commodore has at this show is the Amiga 4000T, which
is housed in a truly professional case similar to an Indigo workstation.
Based on the same technology as the A4000 with a 68040 CPU, this new model is
designed to reside on the floor, thereby freeing valuable desk space, and
comes equipped with 2 megabytes of chip RAM with an additional 6 megs of RAM
on the motherboard, being expandable to 18 megs of RAM total.

The Tower offers 4 Zorro slots in line with 4 AT slots, and 2 video slots,
with built-in IDE and SCSI-2 adaptors. It has a 250 watt power supply, and
drive bays include one 3-1/2", two horizontal 5-1/4" half-height, and one
full-sized 5-1/4" space. The A4000T on display here is for demonstartion
purposes only pending FCC approval.

SCSI-2 Adaptor & Two New Monitors

Another product Commodore is introducing at this show is the A4091 SCSI-2
Adaptor, with 32-bit interface through Zorro 3, which sports a transfer rate
of 10 megabytes/second, synchronous mode with internal and external drives to
a total of 7 devices, four of which can be installed internally.

Commodore also announced two new monitors that are expected to be available
soon, the A1940 and A1942, both of which are designed to work with the A4000
and A1200 and future models. For some incredible reason, neither of these
monitors works in 800x600 (72 Hz) mode now - the mode that only everyone
uses! -- but Commodore pledges that that problem will be corrected before the
monitors are released. One is is 32-dot pitch while the other is 28-dot, and
both have built-in stereo speakers. Retail prices will reportedly be less
than the A1960.

A Peek at the Future

Functioning only partially at the show is a prototype of Commodore's new MPEG
board, a preview of things to come in full motion video! It works only in
playback mode, presenting a Bon Jovi music video that was originally 2.3
gigabytes in size, which, through MPEG, was compressed down to 51 megs which
is a 43 to 1 compression rate! It's astounding to watch this kind of stuff
produced 24-bit graphics.

Eggebrecht said that full motion video -- such as MPEG -- is the key to
future Amiga systems, and reported that Commodore has been talking with
Macintosh developers (he mentioned C-Cubed and SuperMac by name) since they
expect to deliver only the hardware, leaving multimedia MPEG software to
third-party developers. Eggebrecht said the board on display will ultimately
support digitizing.

Commodore is also developing new CD-ROM technology that will work with
existing 4000 and 1200 and future Amiga models, externally at first and but
ultimately built into these systems. Eggebrecht said this new CD-ROM
technology will be similar yet different from that in CDTV, encompassing
double scan modes, improved algoriths for increased speed, and such. He also
said that Commodore is now negotiating with Kodak for Photo-CD support.

Eggebrecht spoke at length on the coming DSP for AGA machines, saying
Commodore has working prototypes (although none were on the show exhibit
floor) based on AT&T's 3210 DSP chip. They're in their second version of
development now, working on a Zorro processor card running at 66 MHz with
heders for modem, video and other devices.

He also revealed that Commodore is now developing two different AA chipsets
(which area also called AGA for Advanced Graphics Architecture), one for
low-end and another for high-end applications, both scheduled for release
sometime in 1994. He went into specific detail on these chips, saying they
are greatly improved over current AGA technology and only be available in new
machines as they require a different motherboards from existing AGA models.

New AA Display Enhancer

Commodore also announced a new display adaptor board aimed at Amiga 4000
models which will address direct memory on the motherboard and simultaneously
talk to hareware and software.

Called the AA Display Enhancer, this is an inline Zorro/video slot board,
which will de-interlace and promote any video mode, so not only can you take
a flickering mode and make it not flicker but you can, for example, promote
15 kHz video mode to a rock-solid 72 Hz. You can also take advantage of its
promotion by creating a screen that wouldn't normally be viewable (like a
1024x1024 10 Hz screen which would flicker like crazy) and promote it to 72
Hz for higher resolutions. Designed for the A4000, this board will work in
the A3000 but you obviously won't AGA graphics.

The Display Enhancer addresses 24-bit video memory, which it can access
directly so you could use it as a 24-bit frame buffer. It will reportedly
come with 2.5 to 3 megs of DRAM and is expandable, so you can use it as a
24-bit paint box, too. It's also equipped with a hardware expansion port
(along with Zorro and video slot) so if someone ever makes a video accelator
(how about 3D Rendering on the fly?) you could add that to it! Release is
projected for 3rd Quarter 1993.

Third-Party Show Quickies!

Gold Disk's Video Director will be upgraded soon, and the company is working
on another patch to Professional Page which we hope to get here at the show
and upload. It addresses bugs supposedly fixed by the patch in the Library
now.

DKB is showing nice A1200 Memory/Clock/FPU board. Called the DKB 1202, is
retails for $189.95 and should be available in April. Populated with 0 RAM,
it is expandable to 8 megs. The 16 MHz 881 coprocessor is built-in, and you
can change it to a higher clock because it's socketed. DKB will also have a
plug-in clock for A1200 available in mid-May for $30. Both products contain
standard lithium batteries.

Scala has released an upgrade for their latest multimedia authoring system
which addresses the new AGA technology. $40 to registered owners.

IV24 V2.0 software/hardware upgrade being shown here by GVP. It has been
released and available at the show, and Soft-Logik will release a major
upgrade to PageStream (v3.0) in July.

Live *StarShip* Show Conference!

We'll have more Show News as soon as announcements from several third-party
developers are typed into 5-MINUTE News articles. And I'll be online LIVE
from New York City in *StarShip* Conference Saturday night, April 3rd at 10PM
Eastern Time! Join me and other World of Commodore *Reporters for MORE News

    ____     ICD Announces A1200 Accelerator & SCSI-2 Controller
   (_  _)    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    / /           Rockford, Illinois -- March 29, 1993
   / /
 _/ /
(____)CD, Incorporated, a leading designer and manufacturer of Amiga hardware
enhancements, today announced a new standard for the Amiga 1200 computer.

ICD's new Viper 1230(TM) was designed to give the popular Amiga 1200 the
performance of a workstation. Viper 1230 offers the Amiga 1200 owner a 68030
accelerator supporting high speed memory expansion, an FPU coprocessor
socket, a battery backed-up real-time clock, and a unique 16-bit Direct
Memory Access (DMA) port for further expansion capabilities.

Viper 1230 uses the power of the Motorola 68030 and supports both EC and MMU
versions from 40 to 50 MHz. When compared to the A1200's stock 68EC020
running at 14 MHz, the larger cache and higher speed of the Viper 1230
processor will make applications fly.

Up to 32 MB of fast RAM can easily be added to Viper 1230 using industry
standard 32-bit wide 72-pin SIMM modules. Two high quality SIMM sockets are
on board for memory expansion. Burst mode, for top speed, is fully supported
using low cost, page mode DRAM.

With the addition of a high speed Motorola 68882 math coprocessor (FPU), all
floating point math routines will run at near warp speed. Applications which
rely heavily on floating point routines such as animation, ray tracing, image
processing, DTP, and CAD will show an amazing improvement.

The battery backed-up clock that is missing from the A1200 can be found on
Viper 1230. This simple, accurate, and reliable design is already supported
by the Amiga OS.

Viper's DMA Port (VDP(TM)) allows many opportunities for high speed add-ons
of the future. Products like a SCSI-2 controller, DSP board, modem, or
networking card could be developed to accommodate this port. VDP
specifications are published in the Viper 1230 hardware installation manual.

Viper 1230 was clearly designed with the customer in mind. The RAM, CPU, FPU,
and the clock battery are all socketed and changeable using industry standard
parts. The low-cost 40 MHz 68EC030 is supported as well as the 50 MHz 68030
for those who want the ultimate in performance with an MMU. Both 40 and 50
MHz FPUs are supported. Low-cost industry standard SIMMs are used for memory
expansion. Viper 1230 and VDP boards are easily installed without removing
the top of the computer. This ensures that Commodore's warranty remains
intact.

Viper 1230 is competitively priced and available with a number of options.
USA suggested retail prices for the basic packages are:

         Viper 1230/40   40 MHz 68EC030, no FPU, no RAM  $499.00
         Viper 1230/50   50 MHz 68030, no FPU, no RAM    $699.00

Viper 1230 comes with a full one year manufacturer's warranty. Extended
warranties are also available within 90 days of purchase.


Viper S2: DMA SCSI-2

ICD also announced the first VDP(TM) plug in card for an Amiga 1200 computer
equipped with the Viper 1230(TM).

Viper S2(TM), the first VDP peripheral designed for the Viper 1230, is a full
DMA SCSI-2 controller offering truly sustainable transfers of 5 MB/sec
asynchronous and 10 MB/sec synchronous.

Viper 1230's DMA Port (VDP) allows the design of high speed add-ons that take
full advantage of Direct Memory Access (DMA) and the speed of a Viper 1230
equipped Amiga 1200 computer.

Viper S2 plugs directly into the DMA expansion connector of the Viper 1230
board. A plastic knockout in the back of the computer is removed, Viper S2 is
plugged in, and one securing screw is installed in the bottom of the
computer. Nothing other than a screw driver is required for installation.
Viper S2 provides a standard high density SCSI-2 connector on the back of the
Amiga 1200 computer.

For those who desire only the best, an internal high density SCSI-2 connector
is included to directly support a 2.5 inch SCSI hard drive inside the Amiga
1200.

A three foot SCSI-2 cable is included to connect with an external SCSI
peripheral using the standard Centronics 50P connector.

Viper S2 is competitively priced and unsurpassed in speed. The USA suggested
retail price is $199.00.

Viper S2 comes with a full one year manufacturer's warranty. Extended
warranties are also available within 90 days of purchase.

For further information, contact ICD Press Relations in the United States by
phone at (815) 968-2228 extension 222 or by fax at (815) 968-6888.

trademarks are those of their respective holders.

(______/igital Expressions Research, publisher of Video Music Box, announced
that it will begin shipment of an innovative new music composition product,
MusicLab - IFS, in May 1993.

Unlike other algorithmic composition programs producing random or popular
music, MusicLab - IFS harnesses organizational properties derived from chaos
and fractals to allow anyone to compose music having complex structural
levels, interrelationships and musical cohesiveness similar to "large-form"
or "classical"-style music compositions. This product will be especially
useful to multimedia developers looking for an alternative to random or
popular stules of background music, and to accomplished musicians looking for
a source of new ideas.

Utilizing Iterated Function Systems and numerical codes, MusicLab - IFS can
encode and generate an infinite variety of fractal and non-fractal musical
scores. Many options exist for arranging scores into musical sequences with
up to eight multi-voiced parts. Sequences can be previewed over both MIDI and
the Amiga's internal audio, and can be saved in both MIDI and IFF SMUS music
file formats.

MusicLab - IFS suggested retail price: $89. Program requires an Amiga with at
least one (1) Meg of memory and Workbench 1.3/2.0.

For more information contact Digital Expressions Research, W6400 Firelane 8,
Menasha, WI 54952, telephone 414/733-6863.

(______/et your Amiga warmed up and your favorite paint and animation program
ready to color eggs!

We like simple contests, so here's the gist of it...

You work up your BEST Amiga artwork around the theme of colored Easter Eggs.

Upload it to the *StarShip* from now until April 5th.  Use the special
     Library set aside Eggsactly for these pictures.

On April 7th, the polls open and ALL *StarShip* members will have ONE VOTE
     each to select their favorite entries.  (The *StarShip* crew has
     chickened out on deciding between so many great entries!)

You MUST own all rights to your entry and it must be an original Amiga
     created picture/animation.

Scanned entries will be disqualified.

You may enter as many times as you like. [We may hate ourselves for this
     rule, but hey, live and learn.]

You may submit an animation or a still picture.  You may use any commonly
     available Amiga graphics mode.  The picture/animation MUST fit on
     a regular or overscanned Amiga-sized monitor screen.  If you wish
     to create a picture using enhanced video/graphics [DCTV, 24-bit
     boards, etc.] you might consider uploading two files in your archive
     so that your entry can be viewed by those with only standard Amigas.
     Remember, your Amiga friends online will be the ones who view entries
     and cast votes!

You MUST include a text file telling how you created your egg including what
     equipment used (particularly for renderings, 24-bit entries, etc.) and
     the resolution you used.  Acceptable entries include hand [mouse]-drawn
     or rendered art. Animations, morphing, 24-bit, whatever you like --
     But NO scanning is allowed!

You MUST include some sort of colored egg(s) in your art submission!


And what might you win?!  We're making up several Baskets of goodies for the
winners!  There's $100 of GEnie-bucks, there's an autographed copy of Denny
Atkin's "Best Amiga Tips and Secrets" book, there's 100 3.5 DS/DD diskettes,
There's $50 of GEnie-bucks, there's deb's favorite new book discovery
"Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time" a delightful illustrated journal of the
world of James Gurney - where Dinosaurs and people still live side by side.
[Theres talk about the possibility of large painted eggs and perhaps some
Amiga software....] And there's more!

Look in the Library for a blank Egg you can download to get started if you
need, and then let's see what you and your Amiga can do!  There's not much
time until Spring Break when the voting starts.  Polls will close at 8 PM
Eastern time on Sunday, April 11th.

Winners will be announced on Sunday, April 11th, at the Amiga Graphics
Conference on the *StarShip*. You do NOT need to be present to win. The
conference will begin at 10 PM Eastern time. Winners wil be notified by GE
