(______/igital Creations' Brilliance Professional Paint and Animation package
actually contains two complete programs: Brilliance and TrueBrilliance.
Brilliance is the register-based version that supports 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,
128, and 256 colors. TrueBrilliance is the HAM/True Color version supporting
millions of colors.

Brilliance was written to provide for optinmal performance and speed no
matter what Amiga model you use. Brilliance performs many graphic operations
faster on a standard 68000 based Amiga than other programs running on a
68030. You want speed? You got it!

With Brilliance you can paint and animate in every graphics mode on the Amiga
including the new modes of the Amiga 1200 and 4000. The all-new, exclusive
Brilliance "True Color" mode allows you to create and modify full fidelity
24-bit pictures in HAM-6 or the new AGA HAM-8 mode. Because Brilliance
retains a full 24-bit buffer, it can pick the best colors for the HAM image;
this removes almost all HAM fringing.

Ease of Use and Productivity

Multiple levels of undo and redo are limited only by the memory in your
machine. Multiple paint and animation buffers, each with their own palette,
are limited only by the memory in your machine. Full palette control with
Load, Save and Remap options. Full preferences printing support.

The Dynamic new stackable menuing system allows greater speed in accessing
all the features of Brilliance. Brilliance has three button mouse support for
even faster access to full screen painting. The third button is used to
remove the stackable menu; if you have a 2-button mouse, removing the menu is
still very easy by using the space bar.

Split screen magnify with advanced options like segment pixels. Brilliance
also includes standard features like zoom in and out functions with
super-fast scrolling.

Animation

Brilliace supports OpCode5 anims as well as the new OpCode8 formats.

Brilliance's powerful tweening system allows you to start and end your brush
at any position and any angle. Ease in and ease out for every parameter,
x,y,z position, x,y,z rotation, and transparency. Trasparency allows brushes
to fade in or out as they progress through the frames of an animation.

The unique mouse interface allows easy positioning of brush start and end
positoins in 3D space. This elegant yet simple interface allows beginners to
create very complex animations while sophisticated users will be delighted
with the full set of animation tools. You can even control which frames the
brush is drawn upon. Brilliance also has full brush morphing and color
cycling with up to 128 colors.

Brush Support

The brush interface has eight brush wells for real-time storage, switch
between brushes or anim brushes by clicking on that well. Full brush handling
controls including Rotate, Size, Flip, Bend, Shear, Outline and Trim, Box Cut
or Freehand cut. Text is handled as brushes so that the full set of brush
tools are at your fingertips. Brilliance supports scalable fonts and
colorfonts under Workbench 2.0 or above.

Fills

Brilliance has a full compliment of fills including color gradient fills
Horizontal, Vertical, Linear, Highlight, Spherical, and Radial. All fills
have conform to shape and auto center options. Also included is our very
powerful 3D perspective fill with selectable levels of Anti-Aliasing.

Easy to use Stencil

The Brilliance Stencil function is very powerful, with tools like lasso for
selecting colors. Setting up a stencil is much quicker than ever before. Of
course, you can still pick the colors by hand.

Drawing Tools

Brilliance has a full set of drawing tools such as Connected Draw, Free form
Draw, Filled Shape, Line, Connected Line, Filled Line, Elliptical Curve, 4
Point Bezier Curve, Rectangle, Filled Rectangle, Ellipse, Filled Ellipse.
Fine Spray Airbrush, Splatter Airbrush, and Shape Airbrush. Brilliance
provides real life air brush controls like pen tip, custom brushes, air brush
through brush mask.

Other basic tools such as snap to grid, miror and cyclic symmetry, lockable
background or foreground, line segmenting tool with # of points and distance
options, quick draw option -- fast feedback and anti-aliasing with selectable
levels -- round out your painting tools.

WORKS IN EVERY GRAPHIC MODE available on the Amiga! Brilliance supports all
Amiga graphic modes including the new modes supported on the new AGA Amigas.
Fantastic images can be created and manipulated in the 24-bit true color
mode, the new 256 color mode, or the new 8-bit HAM mode.

MULTIPLE PICTURE AND ANIMATION BUFFERS. Brilliance is designed to be
productive! You can instantly switch between multiple picture or animations.
Each buffer (picture or animation) can have its own palette and file name.
Work on large picutres limited only by the amount of memory in your Amiga.

A RICH AND COMPLETE SET OF PAINTING MODES. Much more sophisticated than any
other Amiga paint program. All modes have the option of variable transparency
while mixing in RGB or HSV color spaces. Powerful, intuitive, easy to use
point and click user interface.

MULTIPLE LEVELS OF UNDO AND REDO. You can set aside memory for multiple
levels of undo and redo. You can even undo across frames of an animation! The
number of levels of undo is limited only by the amount of memory in your
Amiga.

MULTIPLE BRUSHES. Even multiple Anim Brushes!

HAM AND 24-BIT TRUE COLOR PAINT SUPPORT.

(_____)ome to the Festival!

The Central New York Amiga Aggregate and the State University of New York at
Cortland are co-sponsoring the "Central New York Amiga Festival" at SUNY
Cortland on Sunday, August 22, 1993.

It will be held at the Sperry Learing Resource Center on the main campus from
10 AM until 6 PM. Admission is free and there will be plenty of free parking.
It is easy to reach by existing Route 81 at exit 11 and following the signs
to the campus. Dealers will not be selling, but a number of vendors,
including Commodore, have been invited to show off their products.

In addition, many Amigans will be able to demonstrate their capabilities and
offer help to others from novices to experts. The facility is especially
suited to multimedia and includes a TV studio!

Some of the many topics that will be covered include Desktop Publishing,
Desktop Video (including the Video Toaster), Digital Sound, Multi-Media,
Shareware, AmigaDOS, etc. Other user groups are showing enthusiasm for the
festival, and everybody should have a pleasant experience!

For more information, call Andy Rush (before Sunday) at 607/756-4410.
