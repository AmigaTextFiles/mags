       COMMODORE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER 1993
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ AND FIRST QUARTER 1994 RESULTS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(_____)ommodore International Limited (NYSE: CBU) today reported results for
the fourth quarter ended June 30, 1993, and the first quarter ended Sept. 30,
1993.

  The results are as follows:
                           Quarter              Quarter
                       June 30, 1993       September 30, 1993
                                    (millions)
  Net Sales               $ 73.6                 $ 82.6
  Net Income (Loss)        (82.9)                 ( 9.7)


                   FISCAL 1993 AND FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS

  Commodore International Limited today reported a net loss of $82.9 million,
or $2.51 per share on sales of $73.6 million for the fourth quarter ended June
30, 1993.  This compares with a net loss of $21.9 million, or $0.66 per share
on sales of $140.7 million in the year ago quarter.

  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, the net loss was $356.5 million, or
$10.78 per share compared with net income of $27.6 million, or $0.82 per share
in fiscal 1992.  Sales for the year were $590.8 million compared with $911.0
million in the prior year.

  The intense competitive pricing pressure and economic softness in all major
markets which the Company experienced in previous quarters continued in the
fourth quarter.  These factors combined with a discontinuation of the PC
product line resulted in a sales decline of almost 50% from the prior year
quarter.  In light of the deteriorating market conditions, a provision of $50
million was made for inventory writedowns and restructuring costs.  This
provision is included in the net loss for the fourth quarter of $83 million.

  The net loss for the year of $356 million included $237 million for asset
writedowns, restructuring costs and special pricing and promotional
allowances. This loss has resulted in negative net worth and has had a severe
adverse effect on the Company.

  Irving Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: "Clearly the
financial performance for the fiscal year was extremely unsatisfactory.  The
Company has addressed its current financial difficulties by restructuring its
business in a number of ways including eliminating unprofitable product lines
to focus exclusively on its Amiga products and sharply reducing total
expenses.  These actions, together with the introduction of the new Amiga
CD32, have resulted in improved operating performance enabling substantial
narrowing of the operating loss for the quarter ended September 30, 1993."

         FOOTNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        June 30, 1993

1)  The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
    Company will continue as a going concern.  The Company's
    financial position and operating results raise substantial
    doubts about the Company's ability to continue as a going
    concern.

2)  The Company is attempting to negotiate appropriate credit terms
    with suppliers who have restricted the Company's credit and
    intends to work out a restructuring plan with its creditors,
    including those which have instituted legal action against the
    Company, to allow the Company to continue normal operations.
    However, there can be no assurance that a successful debt
    restructuring will be achieved.

3)  Current debt includes $33 million of senior notes held by
    two institutional lenders.  The Company is in non-compliance
    with the note agreements and is negotiating a waiver from the
    lenders in order to allow the Company to pursue a debt
    restructuring.

4)  In order to obtain needed working capital, a company controlled
    by the chairman loaned $17.0 million in February and April 1993
    to the Company.  An agreement was made to sell $9.5 million of
    inventory in satisfaction of a portion of the debt.  The
    proceeds of these sales were temporarily retained by the Company
    but subsequently repaid to the lending company.  The remaining
    amount of $7.5 million is represented by a collateralized demand
    loan and has been classified as short-term debt as of June 30,
    1993.

 (____)very week, we'll provide you with the closing stock price of
Commodore International, (CBU) traded on the NYSE.



  Commodore's Closing Stock this week hit a high of 4 today on Friday,
  and barely even dipped after the disclosure of the major loss of both
  4th quarter and first quarter financial reports.

  This confidence by investors and Wall Street comes despite the loss,
  and should be a good indicator of things to come. The LOWEST the stock
  closed at all wee was on Monday and Wednesday, and that was only at
  3 5/8ths.

  Volume of trading had slowed down some, but was back up today.

(_/he Newsbytes story was headlined, "****Comdex - Apple Steals 1st Day With
Quadra 610/DOS" and dated 11/15/93.  Why in the world did it show up in
my full text search for "Commodore" at the Newsbytes menu on GEnie
page 316?

Halfway through the article, you can go read it for yourself, the Amiga
3000 was mentioned with an editorial comment by the writer, "The most
fascinating feature of the new Quadra is its ability to run a DOS/Windows
environment concurrently with the Mac's System operating system. The last
time Newsbytes saw true concurrency of this type was on the Commodore Amiga
3000 a few years back."

(_____/ver the past several years, the focus at Bit.Movie has beeen to
provide a contest  for animators and designers where to compare ideas,
technics, new narrative forms born from digital images on personal
computer. Besides confirming the focusing on personal computer, this year
Bit.Movie presents the video section to meet the creative professionals
working with graphics workstation and a new vector graphics category in the
still image section.

This is a sweet time for computer animation. Not only is it being used more
often in films, but it's used routinely now in television for the production
of commercials, show promos, network identification spots, info graphics,
and special effects. New opportunities for computer animation are being
provided by the burgeoning market for CD-ROM games, while in the corporate
and engineering worlds, computer animations continues to gain ground as a
tool for producing presentations, product demonstrations, visualizations,
and simulated walk-throughs. As part of this trend, animation technology is
reaching the hands of a rapidly expanding circle of people. Clearly,
computer animation is coming into its own as a medium and the film "Jurassic
Park" is the celebration of this trend that involves in the first place the
creation of films and special effects.

The computer graphics is undergoing a fundamental change. In the past, when
you wanted to assess a computer artist's skill, one of the first questions
you would ask was the name of the platform he or she used. The idea was that
if you knew the platform, you could make some assumptions about the quality
of work the artist was capable of producing. Today, that question has become
virtually irrelevant. Now that all the popular platforms are capable of
producing professional results, the need for artistic skill is rising while
the importance of using a particular brand of equipment is diminishing.

This rising importance of artistic talent in the field of computer graphics
is especially interesting because of the parallels it shares with the
development history of various other art forms, such as painting and
photography. Much of today's computer-based art emulates traditional media.
This is not necessarily bad-indeed, it's a part of the natural evolution of
any new medium. Early photographers often concentrated on still lifes. But
the leap comes when those in the forefront break into undiscovered areas
that exploit the unique capabilities of the medium.

Too designers get so enamored with the capabilities of today's computer
tecnology that they forget that technology is no replacement for creativity.
Those who forget that risk producing work that is trite and stale. Some
designers continue to fly in logos until you become seasick; they take the
latest algorithms and apply them to everything they do. Many artists find
one or two techniques tey especially like, and then use those in every
picture, thus creating their own visual clichs or what they think is a new
"style", forgetting  that the idea is first and foremost.

Computer artists are reshaping aesthetic sensibilities. Today, the two most
prominent feautures of computer art are its interdisciplinary presentation
and its interactivity. Computer art not only eliminates the passive role of
viewers and the necessity of observing art within separate visual
disciplines, but also abandons the idea of classifying our senses into
disciplinary categories. Computer artists are attempting to stimulate our
whole perceptual system by adding such attributes as sound, touch and
movement to their work and program computers to enable viewers to interact
with electronic devices from a variety of disciplines, such as videodisc
players, lights and audio systems. Furthermore, they are examining how
wearable electronic gear such as goggles and gloves heighten perceptual
experiences to offer the public a more enriched participatory environment.

The fact that the computer graphics is now reaching its own level of
technical maturiry signals the dawning of a new age in computer graphics. We
are very close to a time when we can expect absolutely incredible things to
happen in the computer graphics world. The changes we now seeing in computer
graphics are part of the natural cycle of development for any artistic
medium.

The tools of tecnology must help to encourage experimentation rather than
imprison ideas. Bit.Movie focuses all efforts to growing artistic skill and
creativity between young artists, that meet computer generated images and
animations as one of the most exciting way to make art today.

We hope you you will participate in a session of the contest which suits
your interests. On the following pages you will find complete descriptions
of the contest, submission guidelines and deadline date.

You will find all the competition notes, entries, rules and categories for
submitting your entries in the *StarShip* Library in the file called
BIT_MOVIE-94.LZH  Many thanks to Bill Graham, W.GRAHAM6 for this great
5-MINUTE News Tip and Artist contest!

                              Announcing DiskSalv 3
                      The Original Amiga Disk Recovery Tool
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                              Now Better Than Ever!
    ______                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / __   )            Gibbstown, NJ -- November 13, 1993

 / /__/ /
(______/iskSalv 3 is the first commercial version of DiskSalv.  It is the
fourth major revision of DiskSalv, and it offers features never before
found in DiskSalv or other Amiga disk utilities.  While it would be
difficult to list every new feature of DiskSalv 3 in a reasonably short
announcement letter, new features include:


* A Hot New Look

  The DiskSalv 2 user interface has been completely reworked. While
  the best features have been retained, much has been improved.  The
  font sensitivity is better than ever -- why should a utility tell
  you which font you must use?  The overall look is much cleaner, with
  graphic queues throughout that enhance operations without making
  undue demands on your system's memory or pretending to be a video
  game.  Gadgets and help texts are context sensitive.  Device
  selection throughout is drag-and-drop, though of enhanced list
  selection is still available for the asking.  Interactive AmigaGuide
  links are provided for every gadget and menu function, available at
  the press of the HELP key.

* An Ounce of Prevention...

  A disk can now be checked for troubles without actually making any
  repairs, for extra confidence.  Deleted directories, files, and data
  can be permanently erased for added security, program releases, etc.
  Traditional full or incremental backups are supported, in the same
  style as DiskSalv's recovery functions.  A block-level disk test
  supports bad-block mapping without the need to reformat an active
  partition.

* ...And a Pound of Cure

  You still get traditional DiskSalv functions, only better.
  Undeletes can often be performed in-place.  A fully redesigned
  filter mechanism supports pattern matching on full pathnames,
  file notes, dates, file sizes, and/or protection bits.  Pattern
  matches can be used to include a file in a scan, exclude it, or stop
  a scan on a match.  Any number of filter groups may be active at the
  same time, and such groups may be saved to/loaded from disk.

* When Time Counts

  A new intelligent prefetching disk cache, buffered file I/O, and
  improved internal design makes DiskSalv faster than ever.  The
  scroll bar calculations have been refined for greater accuracy.
  The DiskSalv scanner window can now shrunk to an "iconified" mode,
  and back again, while scanning, to keep your screen less cluttered
  during long DiskSalv operations.

* There's Nothing to Lose

  Device description editing and volume searching functions have been
  greatly enhanced.  DiskSalv can freely convert between its internal
  device format, standard Amiga ASCII format (DOSDrivers files), and
  Rigid Disk Blocks (the standard autoboot format).  DiskSalv can also
  read physical disk descriptions from device/hard disk combinations
  that support this convention.

* Working it Out

  Recovered output can now go to named multiple device groups you
  create.  Such groups can, for instance, let you salvage to a couple
  of different floppy disk drives in a "round-robin" fashion, for the
  fastest possible recovery.  Standard file compression tools can be
  called up in output groups.  DiskSalv recovery "streams" can use
  output groups to automatically manage any number of pipes in-between
  DiskSalv and the destination device.

* Going by the Book

  A complete indexed, printed manual accompanies the on-line
  AmigaGuide manual, to aid both beginner and advanced user.  Details
  range from the basics through a complete theory of operation.
  Decriptions of all DiskSalv file formats and associated C Language
  "include" files are also supplied.

* WHAT A GREAT DEAL!

  All this for only $40.00 (Cash, check, or MO in US Dollars, NJ
  residents please add 6% sales tax, non-US/Canada residents please
  add $10 postage).  DiskSalv 3 is scheduled to ship on or before
  January 2, 1992.  "The manual's not done yet" won't be an excuse;
  any orders placed will go out on disk, on time, even if the printing
  isn't done yet (my main concern on this being the time of year and
  the fact I haven't had to deal with commercial print jobs before).

  Order by direct mail to:Dave Haynie
284 Memorial Avenue
Gibbstown, NJ 08027 USA

**SPECIAL NOTE:  This offer replaces the "semi-commercial manual"
                 for DiskSalv 2 offer made in the DiskSalv V11.27
                 release.  Everyone who ordered the DiskSalv 2 manual
                 will get DiskSalv 3 plus manual instead.

You can download the latest version of DiskSalv 2 from GEnie file# 21598,
