            1993 Data Preservation Awards to Honot Individuals
          for Outstanding Personal Computer Data Backup Programs
   ____   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  (_  _)            New York, N.Y. -- June 29, 1993
   / /
 _/ /
(____)n association with a dozen personal computer users groups, 3M has
established a formal, merit-based awards program honoring individuals who
have created outstanding personal computer data backup and protection
policies for organizations.

The 1993 Data Preservation Awards are intended to help eliminate the nearly
$4 billion in annual productivity losses incurred by U.S. organizations due
to the inadequate backup and protection of personal computer-based data. By
virtue of their advocacy and action, Award winners will have elevated data
backup to a level that reflects the critical value of personal computer data
itself. The Awards will be launched at PC Expo, this week.

The Grand Prize winner will receive a travel package for two to the site of
Preservation Hall -- New Orleans -- including roundtrip airfare, $100
spending money, and a four-night stay at the Hotel Inter-Continental New
Orleans. Cash awards will be presented to the Second Prize winner and the
nominators of both the Grand Prize and Second Prize winners.

Winners will be selected by a blue-ribbon nomination review board of
journalists, corporate users and user group leaders based on five criteria:
originality, execution, communication, motivation and strategic thinking.
Composition of the Data Preservation Review Board will be announced this
summer.

"Several major trends -- the rise of distributed information systems, the
ballooning of personal computer storage capacities, and expanded access to
more sophisticated applications and greater quantities of information -- have
increased both the value and vulnerability of personal computer-based data,"
said Michael Stevens, business development director, 3M Data Storage Tape
Technology Division.

"Those people who have been savvy enough to link personal computer data
backup and protection and their company's overall business health -- whether
administrative assistant or CIO -- merit formal recognition," he added.

User group support

User groups participating in the 1993 Data Preservation Awards include:
Association of Personal Computer User Groups (APCUG), Berkeley Macintosh
Users Group, Boston Computer Society, Capital PC User Group, Inc., Chicago
Computer Society, New York MacUsers' Group, New York Personal Computer Users
Group, North Orange County Computer Club, Sacramento PC Users Group, San
Francisco PC Users Group, Silicon Valley Computer Society, and Washington
Apple Pi.

"The Association of Personal Computer User Groups -- whose 350 member groups
represent more than 300,000 individual computer users -- has been a
consistent advocate of computing practices that show a clear benefit to
individual users," said Judith Brown, president, APCUG. "The protection of
personal computer data is a practice that has never been more critical to
successful computing. We believe honoring those individuals who have raised
themselves to the level of 'backup evangelists' is an excellent first step in
improving organizations' data protection policies."

Application to the 1993 Data Preservation Awards is by nomination only.
Nomination forms may be obtained by calling  1-800-888-1889, ext. 33, through
several electronic bulletin boards and on-line services, and through several
supporting computer users groups.

The 1993 Data Preservation Awards are an outgrowth of a 1992 IntelliQuest
study showing that roughly two-thirds of intensive users in U.S. businesses
are either unprotected by formal data safeguard policies or unaware of their
existence. Significant data losses have already affected more than one of
every four intensive PC users, while roughly half of all business users
expect to sustain a serious loss at one time or another, according to the
study.

As computing resources have been distributed throughout organizations, so has
the responsibility for keeping data stored and used by those resources safe
and secure. Effective data protection policies will have recognized the
challenge of communicating the value of backup throughout an organization, as
well as establishing a rigorous method of exercising specific data
preservation measures.

Winners, their organizations, and their nominators will be honored at a
ceremony at COMDEX/Fall '93. The Data Preservation Awards Trophy, an engraved
crystal design produced by Tiffany & Co., will be presented to the Grand
Prize winner.

To obtain a nomination form, call 1-800-888-1889, ext. 33. [See Below.]
Nominations must be received by September 1, 1993 at the following address:

Not many years ago, losing the data stored on your desktop computer -- if
you had one -- was little more than a nuisance. Personal computers simply
couldn't store that much information. Basic software programs generated
basic, reproducible information. If your personal computer was part of a
large organization, chances were the really sensitive data was jealously
preserved behind the glass walls of a centralized computing facility.

Things change. As personal computers have grown in value to individuals and
organizations, so has the information stored on them. Computer-aided designs.
Financial records. Mailing lists. Medical records. Complex graphics. First
novels. And in many cases, the applications that make all that irreplaceable
information worth having at your fingertips.

Somewhere along the way, those precautions that kept your information safe in
the centralized world haven't kept up with life on the desktop.  In a recent
study for 3M by market researcher IntelliQuest, nearly two-thirds of the
nation's business personal computer users alone were found to be either
unprotected by formal data safeguard policies or unaware of their existence.
Personal computer data losses claimed an average of a week of lost time for
almost 30 percent of all business users. That's the equivalent of nearly $4
billion annually in lost productivity.

It takes individual commitment to make data backup a priority. Initiative.
And a level of excellence worthy of formal recognition.

That's why 3M is sponsoring the 1993 Data Preservation Awards. In association
with national and regional computer user groups, 3M will honor two
individuals -- and their nominating champions -- who have demonstrated an
exceptional commitment to preserving personal computer-based information. By
virtue of their advocacy and action, award recipients will have elevated data
backup to a level that reflects the critical value of the data itself.

If you know someone who fits this description -- at any level of an
organization -- we encourage you to complete the nomination form below. A
cross-industry, blue-ribbon panel of user group leaders, journalists and
industry executives will select two winners on the basis of five criteria:
Originality, Execution, Communication, Motivation, and Strategic Thinking.


Grand Prize winner:   In keeping with theme, the Grand Prize winner will
                      receive a travel package for two to the site of
                      Preservation Hall -- New Orleans -- including airfare,
                      $100 spending money and a four-night stay at the Hotel
                      Inter-Continental New Orleans.
                      Grand Prize winner's nominator: $250.

    _  _    AsimVTR: Advanced Animation Storage & Playback Software
   / \/ \   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  /      \           Ontario, Canada -- July 16, 1993
 / /\  /\ \
(_/  \/  \_)ost animators have experienced the frustration of seeing their
newest creation either played back at less-than-desirable speeds, infected
with unacceptable slowdowns due to complex deltas, or plagued by memory
limitations. The only alternative is outputting to a frame-accurate VTR --
which is costly, time consuming and often inaccessible.

AsimVTR is designed to fill this "video void." Armed with a slate of images,
a hard drive and AsimVTR, you are able to effortlessly record an animation to
hard drive. A full set of commands are available for moving, saving and
loading frames. Almost all screen modes are supported including HAM, EHB and
over-scan, in resolutions up to 736 x 290.

AsimVTR, combined with a transparent display enhancer such as DCTV or HAME,
yields an impressive display tool, perfect for multimedia presentations! Or
you may link a favorite 3D rendering program via AsimVTR's impressive ARexx
command suite.

In playback mode, an on-screen VCR-like control panel is available, which
provides variable frame rates, pausing, and single-stepping. Playback speeds
of up to 60 fps are attainable, depending upon both the screen mode and hard
drive controller speed.

AsimVTR requires AmigaDOS 2.0 or higher.

Suggested retail price:  $89.00 (U.S. funds)
                        $106.80 (Canadian funds)
