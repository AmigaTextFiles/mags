     _____          GVP Develops Accelerator for the A1200
    / ____)         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / /___           King of Prussia, PA -- January 4, 1993
  / /(   )
 / (__) /
(______/VP announced today that it will release an accelertor for Commodore's
new A1200 early in February.

Called the A1230Turbo, this 40Mhz 030 accelerator can be easily installed
inside the expansion bay on the bottom of the A1200 computer. Two SIMM sockets
allow for expansion of up to 32MB of 32-bit wide 60ns DRAM. The A1230Turbo
also includes a socket for an optional FPU, which dramatically increases the
performance of floating-point intensive applications.

Using the same cutting edge technology as is used in GVP's A530 Turbo and
Combo family accelerators, this system, which comes populated with 1MB of
32-bit RAM, features a modular RAM design that allow users many options for
adding memory. When 4MB SIMMS are used, the A1230 can be configured with
either 4MB or 8MB of RAM. The accelerator will also accept 16MB SIMMS which
allows for RAM expansion up to 32MB. Other options allow the user to install
various combinations of 1MB, 4MB and 16MB SIMMS.

"At a U.S. list price of just $499, the A1230Turbo is an affordable way to add
030 acceleration to the A1200 -- making it a viable computer for even the most
serious applications," commented Gary Nush, GVP's Product Manager.

GVP is a privately held company that was founded in 1988. Today it is the
world's largest third-party supplier of peripherals for the Commodore Amiga.
For more information, contact your authorized Amiga dealer or Great Valley
Products (GVP) at 600 Clark Ave., King of Prussia, PA 19406, Telephone
215/337-8770.

(____)ver wondered what REALLY goes on at Commodore? Just WHO these folks are,
where they come from, what they DO? How many times have you (or someone you
know) said "What Commodore ought to do to make the Amiga a success is... (fill
in blank)"? Why is it, do you suppose, that they haven't done just that?

Now, the story will be told.

An upcoming book and video by CBM "survivors" reveals the behind-the-scenes
scoop as experienced by those actually there. Fascinating accounts of the
company, the people and the events behind the Amiga and the truth about the
hows and whys of the notorious Commodore marketing! It's an eye-opening
insiders' look at the corporate culture, the foibles and fiascos, untold tales
and a chance for YOU to grapple with the same challenges!

Sample highlights:

- Company organizational charts show who held/holds which key positions in the
company and what they're responsible for and profiles of these individuals.
Like to write to them and share your opinions? Names named and contacts
provided.

- Surprising, never-before-released information about the launch of new Amiga
models. If the press had ever known...

- What's happened to all those art/ideas/proposals that people have sent to
the company in attempts to contribute to the Amiga's promotion?

- Ever wonder why the company that has had the premiere video and multimedia
computer has produced so few videos and multimedia productions with it? How
are the materials they DO use produced? The facts will amaze you.

- Interesting details about Amiga advertising, the campaigns and those
involved.

- Come along on a visit to West Chester! See for yourself.

- Win one-of-a-kind and original collector's items from the History of Amiga!

The book and video will be available on a very limited basis, as special
editions. If you'd like to be among those on the list to receive more details

popular data file formats in cluding Excel, Lotus and dBase.

Data can be viewed in both record and table mode. Unlimited forms can be
created for both screen display and hard copy printouts. Fields can be
displayed in any order for ease of use.

The VCR-like interface is retained for quick and easy data access including
fast-forward and rewind.

The Filter feature screens records based on multiple criteria and the Quick
Index feature aids with fast record matching.

JoAnn Houston, Vice President of Oxxi, commented. "SBase Personal 4 has
outstanding power and features that should easily satisfy the needs of most
database needs. Nearly all of the features of SBase Professional 4 are
included in SBase Personal 4 with the exception of the DML language and an
ARexx port."

SBase Personal 4 will list for $149.95 and will be available from local Amiga
dealers next month. Upgrades from Superbase Personal are $65 and from
Superbase Personal 2 are $50. Should owners of SBase Personal 4 ever care to
upgrade to SBase Professional 4 the cost is $135.00.

Based in Long Beach, California, Oxxi, Inc. is one of the leading publishers
of productivity software for the Amiga computer. In general, business
productivity products are sold by Oxxi, while graphics entertainment and

    ___  ___              HyperCache Professional
   (_  )(  _)             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    / /_/ /         Regina, SK, Canada -- January 1993
   / __  /
 _/ / / /
(___)(__)yperCache is a media caching system for the Amiga series of personal
computers.  It uses an intelligent caching system to bring the filesystem
performance up to workstation levels, and far exceeds the capabilities of the
standard system, Addbuffers. While any Amiga user can benefit, the greatest
performance gains are realized in situtations where storage devices are
important, such as compiler operation, database manipulation, manipulating
large word-processng files, etc.

Features

        - Works with any AmigaDOS compatible storage device, including
          but not limited to:
                SCSI Hard Drives
                IDE Hard Drive (AT and XT style)
                ST-506 Hard Drives
                Trackdisk-based floppies
                CD-ROM drives (CDTV included!)
                SCSI Tape Backup Units

        - HyperCache employs a pre-fetch technique that intelligently
          reads data BEFORE IT IS REQUESTED. In this way, even first
          time reads that are not in the cache are accelerated.

        - Any number of devices, and any number of units per device (up
          to available memory) may be cached. Drives may be spread
          across multiple devices (SCSI, IDE, and Trackdisk caches
          resident in the same machine simultaneously).

        - Works with any filesystem, independant of device geometry.
          Alternate systems, such as MessyDOS and most CD-ROM filesystems
          are supported.

        - User-configurable cache parameters.  The cache is maintained as
          an n-way associative line cache, where the number of lines, line
          size, prefetch size, and overall cache size are configurable
          independantly for each device being cached. Automatic
          configuration is also supplied for the novice user.

Requirements

        - Kickstart 1.2 or higher (fully compatible and tested with 2.
        - 1M RAM recommended (and it screams with 32 bit RAM!)
        - Floppy, Hard Disk, CD-ROM, and Tape supported

   \_/irtual Reality Laboratories, Inc. announces the scheduled release, in
the first week of February '93, of the latest version of its virtual reality
landscape program, Vistapro 3.0 for the Amiga. Using real-world data from the
U.S. Geological Survey and from NASA Spacecraft, Vistapro 3.0 is a
three-dimensional landscape simulation program which enables the user to
accurately recreate and explore landscapes on the earth and Mars in gorgeous
24-bit color. New in version 3.0 are three-dimensional trees with individually
shaded leaves, improved fractalized clouds and fractal texturing which creates
rock surfaces that look so real you can almost feel the scratchiness of the
granite beneath your hand. The new version also allows the addition of
waterfalls, buildings and roads to landscapes and it generates left and right
images for three-dimensional viewing.

Visit the recent past to see how Mt. St. Helens looked before erupting or take
in the view from inside the cauldera of the huge Martian volcano, Olympus
Mons. Then change the bare Martian landscape into a living, breathing entity.
Set climactic controls to assign sea level, tree line, snow line and haze. Add
rivers (which automatically follow the "path of least resistance") or flood a
basin to make a lake.

Vistapro 3.0 comes with landscape files for you to explore; the cauldera area
of Olympus Mons, Mars; Mt. St. Helens before and after the eruption; El
Capitan in Yosemite, California; Half Dome, Yosemite, California; Crater Lake,
Oregon; Matterhorn, Switzerland; Mt. Fuji, Japan; Mt. LaDole, The Alps; Mt.
Etna, Italy, and more! Also, many additional landscape sets are available
separately including: Valles Marineris, Mars; Yosemite, California; Grand
Canyon, Arizona; the San Francisco Bay Area, California, and many more.


NEW features in Vistapro 3.0:

 o Three-dimensional vegetation: choose from Oak, Pine, Palm, Cactus and
   Grass.
 o Advanced fractalized landscape texturing.
 o Improved fractialized clouds; Save and load cloud maps
 o Add buildings and roads to any landscape.
 o Generates and merges left and right images for 3-D viewing.
 o Support for AmigaDOS 3.0, AGA 256, HAM8 and SuperHiRes modes.
 o Support for NTSC, PAL, VGA, EURO36, EURO72, Super72, DBL, NTSC DBL and
   PAL DBL
 o Direct support for 3- and 4-bit plane DCTV.

Other Vistapro features include:

 o Realistic Images in 24-bit color.
 o Gourand shading, combined with high resolution and interlace, produces
   painting-quality scenes of unparalleled beauty.
 o Variable focal length "camera" lens, unlimited number of lighting
   positions, dithering, roughness, and blend controls.
 o User-defined color palette, night sky, stars, tree line, snow level, waves,
   haze levels, lakes, rivers.
 o Three dimensional wire frame preview saves time -- modify the camera
   settings until you have the exact view you want.
 o Powerful script language for animation control in four animation modes:
   IFF, IFF24, RGB and Vistapro's proprietary VANIM mode.
 o Export your current topo map for editing in a paint program. Then, import
   the modified map back into Vistapro to render the new landscape.
 o User definable screen resolutions including overscan.
 o Direct support for FireCracker and HAM-E.
 o Save images as IFF, IFF24, Turbo Silver objects, and in 24-bit RGB for
   frame buffer output, or print directly from the program.
 o ARexx support.
