                    Atari Inks $500 Million Contract
              with IBM For Multimedia Entertainment System
    _         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \                Sunnyvale, CA -- June 28, 1993

(_/   \_)tari Corp. (AMEX: ATC) announced today that it has contracted with
the IBM Corp.'s (NYSE: IBM) Charlotte, N.C., facility to manufacture the
Atari Jaguar, Atari's new 64-bit multimedia entertainment system.

IBM's multi-year contract is valued at $500 million. The Atari Jaguar, to be
made in the United States, is an interactive multimedia entertainment system
which features over 16 million colors in 24-bit true color graphics and
produces shaded 3-D polygons for manipulation in a "real world" in real time.
A 32-bit expansion port will allow for future connection into cable and
telephone networks, a digital signal processing port for modem usage and
connection to digital audio peripherals. The Jaguar will also feature a
double-speed compact disc peripheral.

"This system is clearly the wave of the future," said Sam Tramiel, president
of Atari. "Because the Jaguar will feature such an array of visual and audio
special effects, we wanted to work with a premier company that we are
confident can manufacture the quality product we have developed."

The Charlotte-based IBM plant, which for 15 years has manufactured and
developed products only for other IBM businesses, just recently began working
with outside companies to meet their production needs. The Atari Jaguar
project represents one of IBM's first entries into manufacturing for the mass
consumer electronics market.

"This is a wonderful opportunity to work with Atari and their new system,"
said Herbert L. Watkins, director of Application Solutions manufacturing at
IBM Charlotte. "Everyone expects IBM to manufacture complex information
technology products, and with this, we'll show that we can competitively
build a sophisticated consumer product."

In addition to assembling the Jaguar, IBM will be responsible for the
component sourcing, quality testing, packaging and distribution. The Jaguar,
announced on June 3, is based on an Atari-designed proprietary 64-bit RISC
processor that features four times the technology currently seen in the
marketplace today. The sound system is based on Atari's proprietary,
high-speed, Digital Signal Processor dedicated to audio which can produce
CD-quality sound.

The Atari Jaguar will be available on a limited basis in the fall, focusing
on the New York market. A national roll-out is expected next year, and the
Jaguar will retail for approximately $200.

NOTE: Atari Corp. manufactures and markets personal computers and video games
for the home, office and educational marketplaces throughout the world. Atari
headquarters are located at 1196 Borregas Ave., Sunnyvale, CA  94089.

The IBM Corp.'s Charlotte facility manufactures and develops for IBM and
other companies a wide variety of products, such as banking systems,
automotive diagnostic systems and electronic circuit boards. The site
includes 2.3 million square feet of work space on a 1,200-acre site. Its
address is 1001 W.T. Harris Blvd., Charlotte, NC  28257. Telephone:
704-594-1000.

                    Steve Worley Talks About Essence II
 ______             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(__  __)              Menlo Park, CA -- June 30, 1993
  / /
 / /
(_/he most major addition should well appreciated. Included with Essence
Volume II for Imagine are well over 150 attribute files which can immediately
be applied to your objects. These are examples of how to use the textures;
sample settings and combinations that show the range of surfaces that almost
all the textures can produce. You can use these files as a library of new
surfaces to add to your object, but more importantly the variety of these
examples will give you a better idea of what each texture is capable of.
There's also a library of on-disk pictures of many of these so you won't have
to render them to get an idea of what they look like. This should reduce the
amount of experimentation needed to find the type of surface you're looking
for.

The textures themselves are a completely different set from the original
volume. These new textures tend to be much more detailed and less "boring"
than the Essence I textures, allowing you to use them directly without having
to use many layers of textures to build a complex surface.  While many of the
Essence I textures were based on "fractal noise", Essence II has many
textures with a different type of appearance, best described as an organic,
randomly tiled surface. This type of texturing is, literally, state of the
art in 1993, with Essence II being the FIRST company to use this new type of
texture basis. NOBODY using an SGI or a PC or a Mac has these! If this sounds
like we're gloating, well, it's because we are. In a year you'll be seeing
textures with this style being used by others, but right now Apex has the
monopoly over these unique surfaces. You can have great fun challenging your
rendering buddies to reproduce these new effects; they won't be able to!

Somewhat like Essence I, Essence II has a variety of textures, with a couple
of themes and many that are just unique.  A partial list of some of the
textures follows.

Space Textures

Gasplanet: This texture makes the turbulent, banded surface of gas planets
such as Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. We even include objects of these three
planets with the correct settings to reproduce the appearance of the real
planets.

Planetring: Absolutely gorgeous planet ring systems, like Saturn's. You can
make a "natural" appearance with subtle shades of colors, or go for the JPL
"photo-enhanced" high contrast electric color scheme. You can make everything
from thin solitary rings to a complex Saturn-style ring system with thousands
of ringlets.

Cyclone: A hurricane spiral, ready to paste onto a planet. It makes a great
Red Spot for Jupiter, or you can use it on a map of Earth and threaten any
city you like with instant destruction.

Spaceship hull: You asked for it, you got it! Irregularly tiled plates, with
varying colors and brightnesses. Another texture ("Machinery") makes the
conduit-and-boxy-structure type of surface that you see on the Death Star.
With altitude mapping of course!

Organic Textures

These cannot be easily described. A set of "organic" surfaces with altitude
mapping which will let you make everything from snake skin to parched,
leather-like hides. Many of them are disgusting, sort of like crusty alien
snot (but worse). And these textures are designed to layer with each other,
producing even more repulsive combinations. One texture in particular makes
lumpy-looking fungus patches which, as one beta tester noted, should not be
shown to the squeamish.

Bumpy Things

If you use Bump from Essence I, throw it away. A new set of altitude textures
gives you the ability to transform a flat plane into a variety of uneven
surfaces.

Stucco and Pitted are much more powerful variants of Bump that allow you to
make surfaces with pits and raised surfaces, or stucco-like layers. You can
erode a landscape in an instant.

Crumpled: Perhaps the coolest texture of all. Its abilities are amazing,
despite the plain name. It makes crumpled paper, cauliflower, even a surface
that looks like just like a pile of berries.

Burnish: Just like the Terminator II logo. Makes outstanding metallic
surfaces, as well as scratches on almost any surface. You flying logo artists
will love this puppy!

Water Effects

Waterdrop: the surface ripples that radiating out from a disturbance in the
water, like a impact of a drop of water.

Waterdropref: like Waterdrop, but this version will also compute REFLECTIONS
of the ripples from the sides of a basin or tub. Very realistic!

Raindrops: Waterdrops falling at random, with definable density and strength.
Very cool and completely automatic!

Seawaves: an ocean surface, with physically correct, animated, windblown
waves.

Miscellaneous textures

LatLonLines: makes a gridwork on a sphere, just like the lines on a globe.

Radarscope: A circular disk, with an animated, sweeping trace. You can use a
brushmap or texture to make "blips" which brighten and fade as the trace
passes over them.

Fiber: sort of a mishmash of intertwined threads, like a ball of twine or a
fiberglass patch.

Faceted: A relative of Crumpled which makes gemstones and photorealistic ice
shards.

A list of just some of the other textures:

   Bumparray              Clusterbump
   Crust                  Flagstones
   Fleck                  Julia
   Plasma                 Polkabump
   Scales                 Shingles
   Vein                   Woodgrain


And thrown in for fun, here's some more statistical comparisons between
Essence I and II:

  34 Essence II textures apply bump mapping. (80%)
   8 Essence I  textures apply bump mapping. (12%)

There are 26 "base" textures in Essence I  with 40 variants. (39%/61%) There
are 30 "base" textures in Essence II with 13 variants. (70%/30%)

If code size is a measure of texture complexity, the average texture
executable size in Volume I was 12K. The average texture executable size in
Volume II is 26K.

Essence II has a list price of $140.00. There is a discount price for IML
readers (and current Essence owners) of $74.00 US. Please call Apex at
415-322-7532 if you have any further questions or wish to order.

(______/VP announces the imminent release of a major upgrade to their
renowned image processing package, ImageFX. Already described as "the most
substantial graphics package to support 24-bit animation" by prominent Warner
Bros. animation director Rusty Mills, ImageFX has now been further enhanced
to meet the changing demands of photographers, graphic artists, animators,
educators, scientists, and hobbyists.

For Mills, ImageFX is "more usable than almost any software package... on any
platform." Now, with the upcoming July release of the newest version
designated 1.5, ImageFX attains new heights in flexibility, raw power, and
value.

Highlights of this comprehensive upgrade include faster global operation,
multilevel UNDO, macro recording, and aspect lock. In addition, users can
expect improved real-time feedback for all painting tools, new drawing tools,
and more crazy effects.

Moreover, there are dozens of new loader and saver modules, extended support
for the new Epson 600 & 800 series scanners, plus framegrabbers like the VLAB
and PP&S 256.  In an move to stretch compatibility, ImageFX 1.5 now directly
supports the Opalvision and Retina display boards. Finally, ImageFX

1.5 pushes the envelope of print quality to the limit, as further
enhancements were made to the already-excellent output routines.

If that weren't enough, the accompanying manual addendum for version 1.5
provides clear explanations of changes and features, plus many existing
chapters have been expanded and revised, making ImageFX 1.5 incredibly easy
to use.

These are just some of the changes made to the program that embodies its
slogan, "Truly Integrated Image Processing." As a tribute to this
integration, Byrd's Eye Software, makers of the very hot ToasterVision
package for NewTek's Video Toaster, have announced ToasterFX; an ingenious
compliment to ImageFX that allows it to load, save, and display directly to
and from the Toaster with professional ease! Furthermore, ToasterFX modules
allow ImageFX to actually preview and paint within the Toaster as well!

With all of the above, plus much more, one might expect to pay dearly for
such an upgrade. However, Great Valley Products will continue to support
their "power to the people" approach by offering this new version to
registered users at only $29.95. Version 1.5 is anticipated to ship beginning
July 15, 1993. More information will be provided as it becomes available.

(______/inosaur Mania is reaching epidemic proportions. A recent survey of
the Software Library of the *StarShip* on GEnie indicates that even in this
last holdout against the fads and trends of the masses, the epidemic is
surely spreading.

We offer the following files as prime evidence that even our beloved Amiga is
not immune to these rampaging prehistoric creatures.

  \_/\_/hen all else fails read the manual.

There is no problem, however complicated that, when looked at in the correct
way, does not become more complicated.

A technical publication that can be misunderstood will be misunderstood.

Ignorance is not an excuse.

As soon as you have the answer start checking it - it's probably wrong.

The really clever bugs never come out until it's gone live.

Bugs that mysteriously disappear tend to re-appear the same way.

Adding manpower to a late-running project invariably makes it later.

Whenever something is demonstrated the number of faults is directly
proportional to the number of viewers.

No system is ever a total failure, it can always serve as an awful example.

No project is ever on time or within its budget.

A test run may be considered successful if less than half the data needs to
be ignored for it to work.

To err is human but to really foul things up requires a computer.

Any given program, when live, is obsolete.

Any given program costs more and takes longer.

If a program is useful it will have to be changed.

If a program is useless it will have to be documented.

Any program will expand to fill available memory.

The value of a program is inversely proportional to the weight of its printed
output.

Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capacity of the programmer who
will have to maintain it.

Make it possible for programmers to write in English and you will find that
programmers cannot write English.

If you don't know what the hell your program is meant to be doing don't start
writing/amending it.

The bigger the project the less time there will be available to do it.

There is a solution to every problem; the only problem is finding it.

After adding two weeks to the schedule for unexpected delays add a further
two weeks for unexpected unexpected delays.

If you pout rubbish into a computer you will get rubbish out but that
rubbish, having passed thru a very expensive machine, will somehow become
sacred and nobody will dare to question it.....

Computer are unreliable but humans are even more unreliable: Therefore at the
source of every error blamed on the computer you will find at least two human
errors including the error of blaming it on  the computer.

Any system that depends on human reliability is unreliable.

The error-detection and correction capabilities of a system will give a very
good guide to the errors it cannot handle.

All programs contain bugs until proved otherwise (which is impossible).

Investment in reliability will increase until it exceeds the cost of the
errors (or until someone insists on getting some work done).

Fuzzy project objectives avoid the embarrassment of estimating the costs.

A carelessly planned project takes three times as long to complete than was
estimated; a carefully planned one only takes twice as long.

Project teams hate weekly progress meetings because they only go to show
their lack of progress.

In every large program is a small program struggling to get out.

Computer paper is strongest along the perforations.

Machines work; people think.

The first ninety percent of the project takes the first ninety percent of the
time; the other ten percent takes the remaining ninety percent.

Phases of a project:

    Exultation
    Disenchantment
    Confusion
    Search For The Guilty
    Punishment Of The Innocent
    Distinction For The Uninvolved.

It works better if you plug it in.

Design a system that even a fool can use and only a fool will want to.

In any slide presentation at least one slide will be backwards, upside down
or both.

Any given project will take twice as long as planned, cost twice as much and
produce half of what the user wanted.

If builders built the way programmers program the first woodpecker would
destroy civilization.

A computer can make as may mistakes in two seconds as twenty men working
twenty years.

The vital chunk of logic is always across the fold of the listing.

Printers only fail to stack very large listings that you didn't check were
stacking.

Bugs are always infectious.

There is always one more bug.

The only people making money these days are the ones selling computer paper.

If a severe problem manifests itself no solution is acceptable unless it is
involved, expensive and time-consuming.

Sufficient funds to do the job are never available; they are easily obtained
for repeated revisions.

Computing power increases as the square of the cost increases. If you want to
do it twice as cheaply you must do it four times as fast.

A computer does what you tell it to do; not what you want it to do.

If a test site functions perfectly all subsequent installations will have
problems.

JCL cards that can be arranged in improper order will be.

The effort required to fix a bug increases geometrically with time.

One reason why a computer can do more work than a person is that it never has
to answer the phone.

Experts have theorized that, thru evolution and inbreeding, programmers may
become a distinct subspecies of the human race.

When putting it into memory remember where you put it.

The more humanlike a computer becomes the less time it spends computing and
the more time it spends doing humanlike work.

If it can go wrong it will (and even if it can't it might)
