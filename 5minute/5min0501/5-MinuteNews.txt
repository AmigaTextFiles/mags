                        NAB Show:  Multimedia World
    ____                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / ___)             Las Vegas, NV -- April 20, 1993

(_____)omputing's wilder side descended on Las Vegas, at the invitation of
the National Association of Broadcasters. It came in the form of NAB
Multimedia World, an exhibit of the latest in multimedia technology held off
the main show floor at the Las Vegas Hilton.

Most of the booths concentrated on low-cost digital video production tools.
The room was dominated by the Silicon Graphics Inc (SGI) booth. SGI is fresh
from creating a joint-venture with George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic,
and the scuttlebutt among the booth's denizens - most are independent
software producers on the SGI Iris platform - was that the company's next
move will be to standardize the way its applications look. The idea is to
make SGI workstations more competitive with the Apple Macintosh as prices
decline.

Apple also had a big booth at Multimedia World. Curiously it seemed as
devoted to the PowerBook portables as anything else. IBM had a booth, touting
its Ultimedia "solution" series, but the IBM managers in the booth never
could explain to Newsbytes who was in charge of the company's multimedia
vision, if anyone.

One wall of the floor was devoted to NewTek Technologies. NewTek, maker of
the Video Toaster, was demonstrating its new Toaster 4000 in the main hall.
This area was filled with independent companies offering Toaster add-on
software, post-production support, or training. The Toaster offers many
common video functions, like switching and special effects, in a single
device, and it seems to have almost single-handedly kept alive the Commodore
Amiga, on which it is based.

The 4000, named for the new Amiga it is built-on, offers faster effects and
enhanced software. Among the publications available at the show were:
"Desktop Video World," from IDG; "Videomaker," from Videomaker of Chico,
California; "New Media," David Bunnell's latest multimedia magazine from San
Mateo, California; "Video Toaster User" from Avid Publications, Cupertino,
California; and the second-ever issue of "Wired," the San Francisco
cyber-maven bi-monthly.

Although NAB Multimedia World was really designed so that station managers
and other industry heavyweights could see the computer technology which is
changing their business, the crowd there on the show's first day mainly
consisted of techie types, resplendent in long hair and t-shirts, spouting
computer jargon.

They asked a number of basic questions, such as: What do broadcasters do
anyway? As Sculley's keynote address indicated, that's not at all clear
anymore. It will be interesting to see whether the station executives
Multimedia World was designed for get a chance to catch it.

                NAB Show:  NewTek Intros A New Video Toaster
   ____         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  (_  _)              Las Vegas, NV -- April 21, 1993
   / /
 _/ /
(____)n two booths, one in the main show hall and one in the adjoining
Multimedia World center, NewTek announced a new version of its famed Video
Toaster, the Video Toaster 4000.

The new model is based on the new Commodore Amiga 4000, but company spokesmen
ranging from vice president Paul Montgomery to product demonstrators
including former "Star Trek: The Next Generation" actor Wil Wheaton
emphasized that the software has been completely updated.

The new Toaster has a switcher with four video inputs and three internal
digital sources, close to 300 video effects, an integrated graphics loader, a
24-bit character generator, and a new paint system.

The Toaster also runs LightWave 3D, a three-dimensional modeling, rendering
and animation system, and ToasterPaint, a video paint system. The company
announced that Lightwave will be used to create graphic effects for Steven
Spielberg's "seaQuest DSV," debuting this fall on NBC. The Toaster also works
with local area networks, including Novell NetWare, meaning it can be the
video element in a corporate network.

Huge crowds and big talk have become something of a tradition with NewTek
since it introduced the Toaster in 1990. This year was no exception. At
Multimedia World, a host of small companies offered Toaster enhancement
software, harder, and training, amidst hand-painted signs seldom seen at
major shows since the 1970s. Said Montgomery. "Since 1990 we've formed a new
industry - Personal Video Production. What we represent is the end of this
show."

                      NAB Show:  Quantel Soldiers On
    _                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \               Las Vegas, NV -- April 21, 1993
  / - \
 / ___ \
(_/   \_)midst all the excitement about digital video production and
standards-based products ranging from the Silicon Graphics Indigo through the
Apple Macintosh to the Amiga-based NewTek Video Toaster, Quantel soldiers on.

Quantel, which is based in Berkshire, England, remains a leader in producing
video editors with names like the Harry, which sell for up to $750,000 each.
While they are all computer-based, they are also proprietary. At this show,
the company introduced a simpler version of its off-line editor called the
Micro Henry, a tapeless on-air presentation product called Clipbox, and
improvements to its digital compositor - known as Hal - as well as its
on-line editor, Henry.

The company remains quite formidable in its market because it gives
broadcasters precisely what they want. Its Paintbox graphics workstation is
hugely popular, not only in video but in publishing, for its super high
resolution images.

US spokesman Dominic Lunney told Newsbytes that the company has no worries
about competitors like Silicon Graphics - which can undercut its prices by a
factor of 10 - or NewTek - whose Toasters may cost one-hundredth as much.

"A general purpose system is compromised," he insisted. "A guy who invests in
a hardware platform can be toast when the hardware changes. We're dedicated
to maintaining our buyers' investment as the hardware changes."

(_/  \/  \_)icroBotics, Inc., the Amiga peripherals manufacturer in
Richardson, Texas, announces the release of the MicroBotics FreeTools
Collection. The MicroBotics FreeTools Collection (MFC) consists of two major
commercial software utilities, RDPrep (v3.91) and MBRTest-2 (v1.22), plus
some additional support programs. Except for a small media and handling
charge, the MFC is available as "freeware" from Microbotics.

RDPrep

RDPrep is a powerful, easy-to-use disk partitioning utility that mades simple
work of the often daunting task of partitioning a hard disk. RDPrep is
designed to work with any interface/driver combination that fully complies
with the AmigaDOS Rigid Disk Block standard and which accepts standard direct
SCSI commands. Even the IDE interface on CBM's new 1200 and 4000 computers
can be addressed by RDPrep and thus RDPrep can be used to support third-party
installations of IDE drives on these systems (which is an importnat
consideration given that fact that CBM does not provide partitioning software
with non-HD 1200s). RDPrep is extremely easy to use -- in most cases its
intelligent defaults will be all the user will need to implement. The
software also has a special "COMPLEX" mode for hard disk experts or special
hardware setups. RDPrep is completely documented by its context sensitive
help facility plus extensive online help files.

MBRTest-2

MBRTest-2 is an Amiga implementation of several industry standard RAM tests
wrapped in a friendly point-and-shoot testing environment. MBRTest-2 will not
only test FastRAM but also ChipRAM -- even the ChipRAM the test itself is
using! MBRTest-2 is the only RAM test that will test all types of memory on
the Amiga (including "high" memory on many accelerator boards). The test
automatically discriminates between 16-bit and 32-bit memory. The software
permits many configuration options including "hands-off" testing. Test
results can be logged to a file for later examination. MBRTest-2 will find
and test all properly implemented third-party memory boards and all standard
Amiga memory areas on all Amigas. It is a useful diagnostic tool for every
Amiga owner and dealer.

MicroBotics is making these two great utilities available on many national
networks including BIX, CompuServe and GEnie (#19227 MICROBOTICS_TOOLS.LHA),
free of charge except for normal telecomm charges. They are also available
directly from MicroBotics for a $7.00 (US) shipping and handling fee (on the
diskette titled "MicroBotics FreeTools Collection"). MicroBotics has granted
permission to non-profit Amiga user groups to distribute the software to
their members. All Amiga dealers may use the software in-house for setup and
testing. Dealers who want to include the software with Amigas or with hard
disk kits should apply to MicroBotics for a free re-distribution license (the
chief provision of which is that they may not impose any charge for the
software). In its freeware edition, the software carries no customer support.
All MicroBotics hardware customers, however, are automatically supported on
the software simply by registering their hardware and providing serial number
information upon request.

Richardson, TX 75081, telephone 214/437-5530 Central Time Zone.

                Moonlighter Software Announces TapeWorm-FS
    _  _        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \/ \             Orlando, FL -- April 27, 1993
  /      \
 / /\  /\ \
(_/  \/  \_)oonlighter Software Development, Inc., announced today the
development of TapeWorm-FS, a filesystem for tape drives in use with the
Commodore Amiga computer. TapeWorm-FS is one-of-a-kind solution; it fills the
requirements that Amiga and Video Toaster users have for storing and
retrieving extremely large files quickly and easily on their SCSI tape
drives. There is no comparable product available for the Amiga or Video
Toaster!

TapeWork-FS will allow any SCSI tape drive to act like an AmigaDOS volume:
You can get directories, add files, copy files, etc. Access times are on the
order of 20 seconds on DAT tape drives. TapeWorm-FS keeps all versions of a
file so that even the original version of a file is overwritten it is still
accessible. A TapeWorm-FS volume is ideal for near-line storage of
framestores and large animation sequences.

TapeWorm-FS will be available in May, 1993 at a suggested retail price of
$129.95. TapeWorm-FS will operate on any Amiga model computer with at least
512 kilobytes of memory or Video Toaster Workstation and a SCSI tape drive
(DAT, 8mm, or QIC).

For more information on TapeWorm-FS or any other of Moonlighter's products,

                    Empire Presents... War in the Gulf
 _        _         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   \_/\_/ar in the Gulf, to be released in May 1993, pits a crack unit of M1
tanks against invading Iraqi forces in northern Kuwait. War in the Gulf is a
game of immense tension and hectic action set against a backdrop of hundreds
of burning oil wells in the oilfields near the Kuwait border.

The year is 1995, and once more the Iraqis have taken one step too many in
the Middle East. Still convinced of their territorial claim to Kuwait, they
have mounted a surprise invasion of Northern Kuwait using two battalions from
the Medina and Nebuchadnezzar Division of the Republican Guard. Not only have
they taken over the Saabriyaa and Ar Rawdatayn oilfields, but they have
overpowered local resistance and invaded Failaka and Bubiyan islands -- the
two most important off-shore possessions of the Kuwait.

Team Kuwait, the stars of War in the Gulf, are a crack unit of mercenary
'tankers,' who are all-American veterans from Operation Desert Storm. Since
the final withdrawal of US troops from Kuwait, the major part of Kuwait's
defence forces have been hired by the ruling al Sabah family. With foreign
assistance not available in the short-term, Team Kuwait is in the frontline
of the offensive to repel the Iraqi invaders.

The format for War in the Gulf gives the player simultaneous control of four
groups of four armed vehicles, most notably the M1A1 tank. Team Kuwait's
first missions will be to completely retake the islands of Failaka Bubiyan,
just off the Kuwait shoreline. If the player is able to succeed at the
furious level of action required in meeting these objectives, then it is only
a short drive over the Khawr-as-Subiyah waterway to meet landfall and the
rump of the Republican Guard on shore. The two major Kuwait oilfields need to
be retaken, and the Iraqis pushed back over the border. It will tkae over
fifteen separate tank battles in the four hundred square miles of oilfield to
achieve success. To be quite frank, only the very best will succeed.

Based on accurate topographical data from Northern Kuwait, War in the Gulf is
sure to be the most explosive game you have ever played.

Available May 1993 on IBM PC, Amiga and Atari ST.

  o  25 battle areas individually coded to very fine detail
  o  View the battlefield from four different perspectives using a 3D mix
      of bitmap and vector graphics
  o Take command of 4 tank units, simultaneously controlling 16 different
      vehicles through the unique split screen control system
  o Call upon the latest military technology including: laser-range finders,
      infra-red imaging, TOW, HEAT and SABOT missles
  o Liberate Kuwait villages, capture oilwells and disrupt desert supply
      lines
  o Lay minefields and order up artillery barrages.

War in the Gulf is the ultimate battefield simulation!

(____)lectronic Arts, known for its production of entertainment software for
personal computers, says its fourth quarter net income is up sixty-one
percent and the company's net income for the year is up sixty-five percent.
The company credits sales of software game titles for the home entertainment
systems Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo (SNES), but says it is gearing up for
new interactive titles for the Sega Genesis and 3DO markets.

Net income for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 1993, was $8,595,000, up
from the $5,322,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1992. Net income for
the fiscal year 1993 was $30,858,000, compared to $18,688,000 for fiscal year
1992, an increase of 65 percent. Like most companies these days, EA reported
revenues that were higher than its net income. The company reported revenues
for the fourth quarter of $86,581,000, compared to $47,999,000 in the fourth
quarter last year, an increase of over 80 percent. And for the year revenues
were $298,386,000, up over 70 percent from fiscal year 1992 revenues of
$175,094,000.

The company says its top-selling titles were twelve of the 51 titles it
released during 1993. Five of the new titles were for the Sega Genesis, six
for the IBM PC, and one for the Amiga. EA says its top-selling new releases
during the quarter were Road Rash II for the Sega; PGA Tour Golf II for the
Sega, John Madden Football '93 for both Sega Genesis and SNES; NHLPA Hockey
'93 for Sega Genesis and SNES; and Bulls vs Blazers for SNES. In addition,
revenue from PC products were up over 35 percent compared to the fourth
quarter last year, the first year-over-year increase in this category in many
quarters. Overall for the fiscal year the company released 51 new products,
compared to 45 last year.

In addition, EA said its presence in the depressed European market was strong
with revenues up in Europe 89 percent. North American revenues were up 56
percent in North America, and Australian revenues showed a 49 percent
increase. However, EA said approximately $7 million of its revenues were out
of the Japanese market.

EA has received attention lately, because the company's founder Tripp
Hawkins, has started 3DO, a company which claims it can revolutionize the
home entertainment market. The first 3DO player was demonstrated at the
Winter Consumer Electronics show in January and the first 3DO player which
will use compact discs (CDs) is to be released from Panasonic this summer.
Billed as the next "VCR" of the 90s, several important companies have gotten
behind the 3DO including American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T). EA says it
is developing titles for the 3DO player as well.

"The 16-bit cartridge market continues to be strong and new CD-ROM formats
such as Sega CD and 3DO offer new opportunities to significantly improve on
the current generation of software, and we believe, expand the markets for
interactive products," said Larry Probst, president and chief executive
officer of Electronic Arts.

     ____              Bullfrog Presents:  SYNDICATE

(____)lectronic Arts has announced the release of Syndicate for the IBM PC
and compatibles and the Commodore Amiga.  Syndicate is the brand new title
from Bullfrog, the creators of Populous and Powermonger, and one of the most
innovative software development teams in the business.

The setting for Synicate is a grim and dangerous future world some time after
the Corporation Wars. The world's multinational corporations grew to such an
extent that their power began to rival that of small countries. Before long
the corporations owned the small countries and corporate influence was felt
at the highest level of world government. Then they developed the CHIP...

The CHIP was a technological revolution that was better than any drug.
Inserted into the head, a CHIP could alter a person's perception of the
outside world, and give hope to the masses by numbing their senses to the
misery and squalor surrounding them. For example, a person living on the 49th
floor of the grimiest city apartment block could buy a "Mansion CHIP(tm)"
which, once inserted, would make him immediately believe he was living in the
grandest, most expensive mansion! 'Why change your evnironment, when you can
change your mind?' ran the company slogan. The only problem was that the CHIP
had a 'back door,' and like any new and potent drug, control of the CHIP
meant control of the people. Before long the corporations were at war with
each other, battling to monopolize CHIP manufacture, toppling nations and
governments in the process.

The greed of the corporations began attracting dangerous criminal elements
and soon the crime Syndicates had infiltrated the corporate boardrooms and
had become the controlling force all over the globe. Using custom built
cyborg-agents, they hunt down rivals and battle each other for ultimate
control of the entire globe.

The player takes the role of a young executive in one such Syndicate who is
looking to make a name for himself. From his control platform in an airship
high above the city, he observes as his agents controlled by CHIP technology
spread the shadow of Syndicate terror in a bid to conquer territory after
territory, ousting the rival Syndicates and striving for world domination.

From the stunningly atmospheric intro sequence with its state-of-the-art 3D
rendered graphics, the player is made aware that Bullfrog has once again
created an original and stimulating experience. Having customized his
corporate logo, he is faced with over fifty elaborate missions -- each set in
a living city, alive with intelligent men and women, cars and commuter
trains, rival agents and law enforcement forces. Within this environment the
player has complete freedom to perpetrate the nefarious deeds of the
Syndicate! Succeed in conquering a territory and he can raise taxes to fund
research and development into more advanced weaponry and cybernetic body
parts. Raise taxes too far and the territory will become ripe for
insurrection and defection to a rival Syndicate.

With the use of new graphic technology -- Syndicate has had more full time
dedicated graphic artists than all Bullfrog's previous projects put together
-- and realistic sound effects including music and digitized speech,
Syndicate is Bullfrog's most unique title to date! Syndicate will be
available on IBM PC and compatibles priced at $59.95, and Commodore Amiga
priced at $49.95 from Electronic Arts in June.
