this cool little program is not well known in the community, here's what it
is:

NoteBook is a unique product designed for your personal use. It actually
moves the functionality of the paper notebook from your desk to your Amiga's
display.

You can use lined paper, graph paper, blank paper; you can put tabs on the
pages and you can write or doodle to your heart's content.

Special structured drawing tools make drawing in NoteBook more flexible and
fun than any other Amiga drawing program. Nothing else comes close to
NoteBook!

Key Features of NoteBook:

      2-32 colors, halfbright, and HAM images on IFF import
      Raw or word-wrapped ASCII text import
 o  Extremely fast - amazing high speed redraws!
 o  Notebooks can contain multiple named section
 o  No slowdown with additional pages -- no limit to number of pages
 o  Will iconify to a tiny window on Workbench for quick access
 o  Any number of levels of grouping for objects - ungrouping too!
 o  Save individual graphic elements for other drawings
 o  Extremely user-friendly
 o  Use paperclips to mark pages for instant access
 o  Clipboard provides cut, copy and paste capabilities

only $29.95. Contact Black Belt in Category 29 on the *StarShip* Bulletin
Board for more information.

NoteBook is highly recommended by the *StarShip* for productivity and yes,
even fun! It comes with a free-standing, freely distributable utility that

(_/   \_)s you undoubtedly know, the *StarShip* 5-MINUTE Weekend News may be
reprinted on privately owned bulletin board services and in user group
newsletters -- it's even distributed on the Internet to thousands of people
around the world! That makes the 5-MINUTE News a great way to for the Amiga
community to be informed about new products and services in a timely manner
as they become available.

Amiga developers, vendors and publishers interested in getting out the word
to this vast audience about their products and services should send
announcements and press releases to the *StarShip* for inclusion in our
5-MINUTE Weekend Newscasts.

Doing so is easy and, of course, there is no charge. You may leave Feedback
to the Amiga SysOps on page 555 for details, or send your information via GE
Mail to P.HERRINGTON. If you announcement isn't readily available in ASCII
text format, you may send it by FAX during daytime business hours to
505/344-9180.

Remember:  It doesn't do much good to design a better mousetrap if the
mousers never find it.

(_/or anyone who has been following the work in "artificial life" lately,
we're assuredly in what can be safely called "exciting times." Techniques
that are both easy to understand and implement have been "discovered" hiding
under the catch-all phrase of "evolutionary methods." These techniques allow
easy computer implementation of systems which learn; and not only learn, but
exhibit astonishingly complex behaviour as well.

Unfortunately for those of us who like to follow such cool things, there's
been nothing available that would demonstrate this class of software in a way
that was easy to understand, much less accessable and fun for the average
computer person. Until now.


Introducing: Black Belt Systems Digital Evolving Soup
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The software that gives new meaning to "Waiter, there's a FLY in my soup!"

    - Easy to use
    - Easy to understand
    - Graphically oriented
    - Designed to let you readily tweak, poke, prod, and worse. Er, more.

So, here's the big question - are YOU interested? It's a hard question to
answer offhand, and that's the why of this post. I'm truly not certain of
what to do with this software. A great deal of time went into its development
(ok, it's true - I sleep very little... :^) and everyone who has seen it
seems to be quite taken with it. Which I did NOT expect, frankly. Let me poke
you with a few questions, all quite serious if not lacking in smiles:


   Would you like to have a program that shows YOUR critters running round,
   live (to abuse a word), on your computer monitor? Ever get the urge to
   hand optimize a genome? Are you one of those people obsessed with
   wondering what "Johnny" will be like when he grows up? Got an itch to
   implement a eugenics regimen on your neighbors? Do your friends and
   family ever accuse you of "playing god," or wanting to? Ever wonder what
   would happen if the background cosmic radiation suddenly increased? Did
   you read William Gibson's "Neuromancer" and mutter to yourself for days
   about the Turing Police?


Like the ads say, if you answered yes to one or more of these questions
you're, well, you're probably a candidate for the loony bin. Except I *do*
have something that's likely to keep you home sitting in front of your
computer instead of telling people these things and getting a bad reputation.

What I do with this software is up to you, and the rest of the net community.
I'm having fun with it, and frankly that's what I wrote it for, but it would
seem (if you listen to the people around here) that perhaps others might want
to poke and prod this thing a bit.

I have packaged this program inexpensively and can get it into your hands for
25 bucks including shipping. But it's only available direct from Black Belt
Systems. My online inquiries indicate GREAT interest in it and if lots of you
evidence that by placing your order, well, then we get to the issue of
Version Two. <mad grin>

     ASDG's AdPro           ASDG's AdPro2
     ASDG's Morph Plus      ASDG's EPSON scanner support software

If so, Black Belt Systems has a special offer for you. When you send us any
page from any of these ASDG manuals and $94.95 in US funds, we'll send you
your very own pre-registered copy of Imagemaster, with full technical support
already activated. Shipping is free. This is an amazing $155.00 savings from
the retail price of Imagemaster!  That's right, for just this one-time low
price you can keep your ASDG software, yet still upgrade to:

   o  True WYSIWYG image processing on any number of images at once
   o  True WYSIWYG image composition with blending, feathering and masking
   o  True WYSIWYG paintbox: fills, blends, masked brushes, etc
   o  True WYSIWYG image analysis - area, distance, color counts, and more
   o  Standard WYSIWYG operations, plus several no one else offers:
         - PolyArcs       - Custom Shapes      - Live Repositioning
         - Ellipses       - Rectangles         - Freehand
         - Polygons       - Floodfills         - Area by Color
         - Undo & ReDo    - Centered Rects     - Logical Regions
   o  Better than three times the image manipulation tools that AdPro2
      offers, all WYSIWYG, not limited to full-screen as is AdPro2
   o  Making much better looking Amiga-mode images than does AdPro2
   o  The capability of handling many more image file formats than AdPro2
   o  A sophisticated, multitasking, '040 friendly and easy to use
      scanner support system for the 24-bit EPSON flatbed scanners
   o  The most powerful and flexible morphing software available for
      any PC, anywhere - ASDG's Morph Plus is nowhere near as flexible.
   o  Memory-friendly: Imagemaster does NOT "grab" all your memory as
      does AdPro and Morph Plus. We did it right!
   o  Imagemaster actually lets you operate on images in the new AGA modes
   o  Regular, significant upgrades - we upgrade almost every month
   o  Direct support for GigaMem VM software - to handle huge images
   o  Sends images directly to GVP's powerful ImageFX software
   o  Includes complete developer support C & ARexx code + examples

Want more info? Just call us toll-free during Mountain Time business hours.

Offer is valid for a limited time only -- until the end February 1993! Free
shipping available to customers in the continental United States and Canada;
outside these areas, a shipping charge does apply. Offer is also valid for
ASDG's AdPro software which the customer has obtained as a part of
Commodore's "power-up" offer for the new Amiga a4000 and a1200 machines.
Requires WorkBench 2.0 or higher, hard disk drive and at least 5 megs memory.

                       NeXT To Become Software Company
    _    _             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \  / )        Redwood City, CA -- February 10, 1993
  /   \/ /

(_/  \_/eXT Computer, Inc. today announced that it is accelerating its
transition to a software company and plans to sell its hardware operations.
The restructured company's mission is to establish NeXTSTEP as one of the
leading object-oriented software environments for developing and deploying
client/server applications on industry-standard hardware platforms.

"We had planned to make this a more gradual transition, but the imminent
availability of the Intel processor version of NeXTSTEP, combined with the
commoditization of the hardware industry, meant we had no choice but to
accelerate our schedule," said Steven P. Jobs, NeXT's chairman and CEO. "We
need to act now to capitalize on our market lead before Cairo and Taligent
enter the game."

NeXTSTEP is widely recognized as the most advanced object-oriented system
software environment currently available. With seven years of development
behind it and 50,000 users, its lead over Taligent's operating system and
Microsoft's Cairo neither of which is expected to ship before the end of 1994
is significant. Industry analysts such as IDC anticipate a significant shift
from traditional to object-oriented desktop operating systems during the
mid-1990s.

The Transition NeXT began the transition to a software company today with the
announcement of its restructuring. The transition will be complete by the
second-annual NeXTWORLD Expo, May 25-27 in San Francisco, where 10,000
customers are expected to attend more than 100 exhibits, a developer
conference and a user conference.

NeXT emerges from this transition not only as a more focused company, but
also as a stronger business. NeXT as a software supplier will have a leaner
200-person operation and a pipeline of orders for the Intel processor version
of NeXTSTEP. Significantly, NeXT is also developing alliances with hardware
manufacturers that would have been difficult or impossible to develop if NeXT
had itself remained a manufacturer of proprietary hardware.

NeXT is currently expanding all areas of its software operations to emphasize
technologies where NeXT adds unique value. At the same time, because NeXT is
no longer in the hardware business, it is eliminating all aspects of its
hardware operations, from design through manufacturing, and scaling back
sales, marketing and administration. Of NeXT's more than 530 employees, 200
will remain in the new company; approximately 280 will be let go from sales,
marketing, manufacturing and administration worldwide. NeXT is providing
terminated employees with a generous separation package as well as a variety
of outplacement services.

Production has now ceased for NeXT's hardware. NeXT has an existing inventory
to fill customer orders until May 25, when the Intel processor version of
NeXTSTEP will be available. All existing support and service agreements will
be honored.

NeXT will be selling its hardware design center and factory. Announcements
will be forthcoming.

NeXTComputer, Inc. develops and markets the industry-acclaimed NeXTSTEP
object- oriented software for industry-standard computer architectures such
as the Intel486 and Pentium. NeXTSTEP is used by corporate customers to
develop and deploy client/server applications, using both custom and
shrink-wrapped productivity software.

                 Fighter Duel Pro Flight Recorder Available
       _         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      / )              Rockville, MD -- February 193

( (_/ /
 \___/aeger Software has announced availability of FDPro Flight Recorder, the
first aerodynamic motion path generator available for the Amiga. Flight
Recorder has gained some new 3D program output formats. Flight Recorder can
now generate Imagine 2.0 staging files, Impulse 3D object format, Vista Pro
camera script files, Videoscape/Lightwave object files, as well as Lightwave
3D motion files.

Flight Recorder retains all the breakthrough features of the Fighter Duel
WWII flight simulator series, while adding the ability to create realistic
and complex object motion paths for use with NewTek's Lightwave 3D software
as well as Impulse's Imagine 3D and Virtual Reality Lab's Vista Pro. FDPro
Flight Recorder also has the ability to simultaneously generate Fighter Duel
Pro Demo Reels that can be used to review the flights.

Now you can create in minutes an aerodynamically correct flight path that
once took years, or a company's logo move that took weeks. Flight Recorder
simultaneously records the positional and attitude information of three
aircraft at 30 frames per second for a duration of 45 minutes on a 9 megabyte
system. Motion paths can then be imported into Lightwave 3D and Imagine to
animate flying objects, the camera viewpoint, aircraft, spacecraft, and
logos. The second and third aircraft are controlled either by computer or by
another person via serial port link.

FDPro Flight Recorder runs on any Amiga with 3 or more megs of RAM, Kickstart
1.2 or higher, hard drive recommended. Release date for FDPro Recorder is
March 1, 1993, and the list price is $79.95, although for a limited time the
direct order price is $70. FDPro Flight Recorder is available to owners of
Fighter Duel Pro as an upgrade for $25 by sending Jaeger the original Disk1
and $25 (certified check or money order, shipping included).

For more information, you can reach Jaeger Software in the *StarShip*
Bulletin Board or by writing to 7800 White Cliff Terrace, Rockville, MD
20855, or call 301/948-6862.
