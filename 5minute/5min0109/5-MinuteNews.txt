(_____)ommodore Business Machines, Inc. today announced that the company's
newest and most technologically advanced systems, the Amiga(R) 4000 and the
Amiga 1200, will be available at major cost-savings through its "Power Up"
program. This offer begins January 1, 1993 and runs through March 31, 1993.

The Amiga 4000-25/120 plus ASDG Art Department Professional(tm) and
Electronic Arts DeluxePaint IV AGA will be available for a Manufacturer
Suggested Retail Price of $2693, a savings of $1500 (if these items are sold
separately). The A4000 was introduced in September 1992 as Commodore's
premier multimedia computer.

The Amiga 1200 plus SoftWood Inc.'s Final Copy 1.3 (TM) and Electronic Arts
DeluxePaint IV AGA will be available at a MSRP of $599, a savings of $600.
Both the A4000 and the A1200 feature Commodore's new Advanced Graphics
Architecture (AGA) chip set that enables users to display and animate
graphics in multiple resolutions at up to 256,000 colors from a palette of
16.8 million colors.

Important to note is that the "Power Up" software programs listed with the
A4000 and the A1200 are not packaged with the systems. Customers will receive
these software packages within 30 days, at no additional cost, directly from
Commodore after receipt of proof of purchase and a completed CPU Warranty
Card. All "Power Up" software offers are designed to support the AGA chip set
design.

The A4000 comes standard with a 120MB hard drive, 6MB of memory, a dual speed
high-density floppy drive, and CrossDOS software which enables users to read
and write to MS-DOS formatted floppy and hard drives. The A1200, the lower
cost, entry level member of the AGA based family, is the company's newest
32-bit personal computer. Other features include a low-profile design,
CrossDOS and PCMCIA expandability.

"Since their introduction, both the A4000 and the A1200 have been widely
publicized as the newest standard setters for video and multimedia users.
Now, through the "Power Up" program, these Amiga systems are being offered at
substantial savings. This program is an excellent opportunity for multimedia
users to purchase outstanding Amiga equipment at competitive prices,"
commented David Archambault, director of business marketing.

                 Trifecta 2000: A new standard in hard cards
    ____                  for Amiga 2000 and 2500 computers
   (_  _)                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    / /             Rockfold, IL -- November 10, 1992
   / /
 _/ /
(____)CD, Incorporated, a leading designer and manufacturer of hardware
enhancements for Amiga computers, today began shipping the new Trifecta(TM)
2000, a new standard for Amiga 2000 and 2500 computer hard cards.

Trifecta offers the top three computer peripherals in your choice of packages
and options to fit your budget.

Trifecta is absolutely the quickest SCSI hard drive controller available for
an Amiga computer, bar none. This SCSI-2 controller offers 10 Megabytes per
second synchronous and 5 Megabytes per second asynchronous transfers. Data
flow is full DMA on the bus and hidden DMA to Trifecta RAM. This keeps
sustained transfer rates extremely high while using very little CPU time,
which makes the Trifecta 2000 ideal for Video Toaster machines or
applications that take advantage of the Amiga s multi-tasking capabilities.
Whether your Amiga uses a 68000, 68020, 68030 or 68040 you won't find a
faster hard card.

Trifecta is a high performance 16-bit IDE (AT) hard card for connecting
low-cost IDE hard drives to an Amiga computer. Quick block transfers combined
with intelligent caching make IDE drives on this card as fast or faster than
most 16-bit SCSI cards. The hard card configuration has ample physical space
and mounting holes to attach a 2.5 or 3.5 inch hard drive on the board. One
or two drives are supported on this IDE interface while up to seven drives
are supported by Trifecta's SCSI interface.

Trifecta is a high performance fast RAM card which supports up to 8 Megabytes
of 0 wait-state RAM using low-power 4 Megabit ZIP DRAM ICs. Hidden DMA from
the SCSI-2 section in to this RAM takes almost no CPU time which keeps a
multi-tasking computer zipping along.

Amiga 2000 and 2500 owners can choose from Trifecta 2000 LX with all of these
features on a single hard card or the low cost Trifecta 2000 EC without the
SCSI-2 feature. A simple, plug-in upgrade kit is available to add the LX
option at a later date.

For the past few years ICD has enjoyed an enviable reputation as an innovator
in the development of interfaces and peripherals for Amiga computers.
Products like Flicker Free Video, AdSpeed, AdRAM 540, and Novia, have defined
new paths in Amiga architecture. Not willing to rest on its laurels, ICD is
always looking for ways to push the envelope for data transfer rates, to use
the latest in hardware and software technology in order to continually
redefine state-of-the-art in the Amiga market. This path will give ICD
customers the fastest possible hard drives, with uncompromising compatibility
and speed at competitive prices.

Trifecta 2000 includes ICD's all new version 4 software package. Version 4
provides a new AmigaDOS 2 friendly front-end with user-friendly features to
help beginners get going without replacing the features that advanced users
expect.

Thomas Harker, president of ICD, explained, "We simply asked our customers
what they would like to see ICD develop. Trifecta is the answer. We offer an
upgradeable entry level solution with the EC package or the full blown deluxe
LX package for those who want the best. The SCSI-2 controller with direct
memory access is guaranteed to be unbeatable. ICD engineers have figured out
how to tame DMA, how to benefit from the performance but avoid the drawbacks
that other companies have had so far such as losing data over the serial
port."

All Trifecta packages are competitively priced. Suggested retail prices for
the Trifecta products are: Trifecta 2000 EC at $199.95, the Trifecta 2000 LX
at $249.95 and the Trifecta EC to LX upgrade kit at $79.95.

Trifecta comes with a full one year warranty.

For further information, contact Thomas Harker at ICD in the United States by
phone (815) 968-2228 extension 220 or fax (815) 968-6888.

Amiga 500 owners can choose from Trifecta 500 LX and Trifecta 500 EC.
Trifecta 500 comes in a side-car type case with styling to match the Amiga
500 perfectly. External "game" switches disable RAM and/or hard drives as
desired. A "Mini-Slot" expansion connector allows access to all A500
expansion bus signals. A universal switching power supply insures full
compliance with Commodore's A500 power limitations in all countries. Generous
cooling vents in the attractive plastic case top keep Trifecta 500 running
cool without the unnecessary noise of a fan. The sturdy metal base provides
strong support for hard drive mounting and connection to the Amiga 500
expansion bus. As with the Amiga 2000 versions, SCSI is an option on the EC
version.

                   Deluxe Music II Programmer Speaks Out
     ____          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    / ___)            by David Joiner, December 1992
   / (_          Author of Music-X and Faery Tale Adventure
  / ___)
 / /
(_/or over a year now, I've been working on an exciting project which,
unfortunately, I could not tell you about.

Last October, my company (The Dreamers Guild) was hired by Electronic Arts to
update Deluxe Music Construction Set for the Amiga. After some review, it was
decided that nothing less than a complete rewrite would suffice. (None of the
existing Amiga code was used -- instead, I used the current Mac version,
written in Pascal, as a reference).

The project is now in testing, and is expected to be released in March of
next year. (BTW, the beta-testers have already been selected and approved by
EA, so please don't send me mail asking if you can be a beta-tester).

    Here just a few of the features of the new version:

    o   Complete new user interface design, in accordance with the Amiga
        User Interface Style Guide. All aspects of the user interface
        are now font-aware and resolution-aware.

    o   Complete ARexx implementation. Not only can you control almost
        every facet of the program via ARexx, but you can also write
        scripts that scan through the score, adding notes and making
        changes. This allows you to create filtering scripts, or write
        algorithmic composition programs. Also, an ARexx console, similar
        to the one in TurboText, is provided, as well as the ability
        to assign ARexx scripts to the Amiga function keys.

    o   Supports multiple display modes and public screens. (Should run
        fine on a Moniterm-type monitor, where you'll be able to see
        a full page of music at once!).

    o   Runs under both 2.0 and 1.3 (1.3 compatibility provided by
        emulation libraries).

    o   Vastly improved print quality. (From about 18 inches away, I
        can't tell that it didn't come out of a music book!)

    o   Multiple documents (limited only by available memory).

    o   Many limitations removed or expanded.

    o   Improved memory use. Deluxe Music only takes what memory it needs
        for the current music in memory, and uses a memory-block management
        system to avoid fragmentation.

    o   Deluxe Music will come with a freely-distributable, stand-alone
        player utility that can be used either from the CLI, or can be
        used as a default tool for Workbench icons. (Now you can upload
        your songs, and upload the player as well!)

    o   Fully localizable using locale.library (emulated under 1.3).

    o   Supports the new "camd.library" and "realtime.library". Now Deluxe
        Music can coexist with other MIDI programs, and use 3rd-party
        serial cards. In addition, Deluxe Music will be able to synchronize
        with animation players that use realtime.library for interactive
        multimedia presentations.

    o   Uses a new file format, "FORM CMUS" (Common Musical Score) which
        replaces the old SMUS score. CMUS will be a public file format,
        unlike the old DMCS file format. (And I bet you all thought that
        my big CMUS discussion in amiga.dev/standards had something to do
        with Music-X, didn't you?)

    o   In addition to the new CMUS format, Deluxe Music also imports the
        following file types:

            -- Old DMCS (FORM DMCS)
            -- Simple Musical Score (FORM SMUS)
            -- Standard MIDI (SMF)
            -- Music-X (FORM MSCX)

        File type is automatically detected at load time -- no need for
        a seperate "import" command.

    o   Deluxe Music can save out CMUS, SMUS or Standard MIDI Files.

    o   Deluxe Music will use the Commodore Installer utility.

                     Yet Another Upgrade! SuperJAM! 1.1
    _                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \                 Atlanta, GA -- December, 1992

(_/   \_)lthough SuperJAM! has met with rave reviews, here at Blue Ribbon
SoundWorks we've been busily improving and expanding its features. To do so,
we asembled a high-level team of musicians, engineers and SuperJAM! users to
find out what was important in making SuperJAM! useful, exciting,
entertaining and innovative. We then listened intently to the feedback we
received from SuperJAM! users worldwide. Taking all of this into account, we
created SuperJAM! 1.1!

SuperJAM! 1.1 provides you with even more composing power. To begin with,
we've created Stereo TurboSounds. Now you can assign each TurboSound to
either the left or right speaker. We then added a Graphical Mixing grid that
lets you drag your instruments up and down or slide to easily adjust your
panning and volume settings.

For those who design chords, SuperJAM! now includes two-octave Chord
creation. You can creath 11th and 13th chords and split your chords, so that
the Bass sounds on the "bottom" of the keyboard and the other Band Members
sound "on top!"

Composing is even easier with our new Eas-o-matic MusicMaker. Using a few
simple keystrokes, you can compose full-fledged melodies and chord
progressions in real-time. The Eas-o-matic MusicMaker helps you make musical
choices. Plus, you can now access intros, breaks and ends, as well as fills,
from the Keyboard window.

Even SuperJAM!'s styles are more sophisticated. Now each and every Style
contains four Grooves. Each Groove provides a subtle musical variation, which
gives you greater control over the shape of your composition. We even updated
every Style included with SuperJAM! with these Grooves.

Finally, we've improved SuperJAM!'s look and feel, including Workbench 2.0
added feature support such as ASL file requester, public screen and virtual
screen size.

SuperJAM! 1.1 ($149) works splendidly with The One-Stop Music Shop, too!

Venture Center, 1605 Chantilly Drive NE, Suite 200, Atlanta, GA 30324, or
call 404/315-0212.

best paint program currently available in the United States for the Amiga."
Camcorder magazine proclaimed "OpalVision is awesome!"

The OpalVision system is a combination of several modular boards which occupy

main board is a true 24-Bit RGB display device which includes OpalPaint,
OpalPresents and OpalAniMATE software. Additional plug-in modules are under
development which add a framegrabber, genlocker, production switcher, Digital
Video Effects and scan-rate conversion. The OpalVision main board has a
