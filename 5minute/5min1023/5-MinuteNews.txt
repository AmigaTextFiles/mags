  ____              India -- Commodore Peddles Amiga
 / ___)             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
( (__    Newsbytes News Network, Bombay, India -- October 13, 1993
 \__ \
 ___) )
(____/ ilicon Holdings & Finance Pvt. Ltd., is introducing computer systems
from Commodore Business Machines Ltd., of the UK at CSI '93, the Computer
Society of India's Annual Convention & Exhibition to be held in Bombay,
November 3-6.

The models to be launched are the C-64, Amiga 600HD, A-1200, CD 32, A-3000,
A-4000-030 and the A-4000-040. Prices of these vary from Rs 3,500 (around
$115) for the C-64 home computer to Rs 2 lakh (around $6700) for the Amiga
4000 series.

Based on an 8500 microprocessor, the C-64 home computer comes with a word
processor and a spreadsheet. Worldwide, Commodore has an installed base of
over 12 million units for its C-64.

The Amiga 600HD supports three chips for video, graphics and animation, and
sound. The model has a PCMCIA-card slot, a programmable I/O parallel port,
a programmable serial port and two control ports for add-ons like
mouse/joystick, graphics tablet or a lightpen.

The A-1200 has a chip memory of 2 MB RAM expandable to 4 MB in the CPU slot
and an additional 4 MB of 16-bit RAM in the PCMCIA slot.

All the Amiga machines are for use in desktop video, animation, morphing,
digital sound processing, music composition and cell animation.

Silicon expects to sell 1,000 Amiga systems by March 1994. "The increased
demand for television programs with introduction of Zee TV (a
satellite-based television channel beaming from Hong Kong), several
channels on Doordarshan (the government-controlled television company,
which has recently launched five new satellite channels to counter Rupert
Murdoch's STAR TV) and the video channels present a huge market potential
for Amiga units," says Suresh.

This is not the first time that Commodore has tried to enter India. About
four years ago, Commander Computers Ltd., a Bhubaneshwar-based company,
attempted a manufacturing and marketing tie-up with Commodore. However,
"This project never took off and the firm no longer exists," says Suresh.
As per the agreement, Silicon has been appointed the exclusive Commodore
dealer for India and the nonexclusive dealer for Singapore, Dubai, Sri
Lanka, Hong Kong, Nepal, Bangladesh and the whole of the African continent.

The company plans to assemble the systems in India. A financial
institution, the tie-up with Commodore is Silicon's first foray into
computers.

(__  __)       *StarShip* News Network -- October 22, 1993
  / /
 / /
(_/ulsa Junior College in Tulsa, Oklahoma is offering its new Desktop Video
Production Associates Degree Program beginning this month.  The first
classes started 10/19/93.  This two year degree is centered around the
Commodore Amiga and the Newtek Toaster,  the recognized leader in the area
of Desktop Video Production.  Students wishing to enter this new field in
the area of Television Production or Movie Production will learn the ins
and outs of Desktop Video.  In addition, companies and businesses utilizing
Commodore Amiga's will be able to send their employees to these classes to
assist in training or educating them in this arena.

The first classes offered this fall will be Introduction to the Amiga, with
two sections offered at night.  The Spring semester will see another
offering of Introduction to the Amiga as well as a 2D Graphics class.  The
Introduction to the Amiga class runs approximately $38 in cost and is
offered at the Metro campus in downtown Tulsa.

The classes for the Fall have filled quickly and there were only a few
openings available just before the beginning of the term last week.

The course catalog lists the classes required for this degree:


   Introduction to the Amiga - ARexx, AmigaDOS, WorkBench, Hardware
   Graphics I                - 2-D Graphics and effects.

   Multimedia I              - Integration of graphics, animations, music
                               and sound media for video production
   Interactive Multimedia    - Continuation of above w/ Interactive emphasis

                               in local business community.


Students will work on Amiga 1200's as well as Toaster systems in the core
classes.  The program will cover the hardware and software used in Desktop
Video Production.  The students completing these courses will feel
comfortable on a Toaster system, or on an Amiga seperately utilizing
packages for character generation, genlocking, 2D and 3D graphics and
animation.

For more information on this program, contact, Tony Krehbiel, Business
Services office, Tulsa Junior College, (voice) 918-631-7039 or (fax)
918-631-7298

Tulsa Junior College offers full Federal Financial Aid programs for
their degree programs.


Scott Carr, S.CARR2, was president of the Tulsa area Amiga Users Group,
and had the fortunate experience of helping to participate in the
development and planning of this program.  When asked how it came about,
he explained, "Several key members and I began a small campaign to Tulsa
Junior College to 'enlighten' their Computer Science department on what the
Amiga actually is, and what it can do.  This ended up in two different
demonstrations - the first from a strictly Computer Science point of view,
the second from a video and graphics point of view.  Our intent was to offer
the possibilities the Amiga had to a 'niche' marketplace.  TJC was more than
interested -- they were absolutely in love with the idea!"

And the program was born.

Thank YOU, Scott, for sharing this great news story with us.  I am sure that
the college will find this a popular degree.

            DevWare Video & Atomic Toaster Release Crouton Tools
    ______  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / __   )            Poway, CA -- October 11, 1993

(______/evWare, Inc., the California-based direct marketer and distributor of
software and video tapes for the Amiga, and Atomic Toaster, now working with
DevWare as their new Video Toaster sales and product development division,
announce that Crouton Tools, the first product in The Scene Machine Series of
utilities for the Video Toaster was released today. The list price of Crouton
Tools is $79.95. A Video Toaster 3.0 and 4000 version will be available
November 1.

Crouton Tools will add over 150 new functions to the Video Toaster and give
Video Toaster users pre-defined ARexx control over their most-used Video
Toaster-related programs and peripherals. These new fuctions will allow the
user to be more productive and creative when using third party-developed
products.

With Crouton Tools, powerful programs such as Art Department Pro 2.+,
AmiLink, Personal SFC, Personal TBC, Studio 16, MONTAGE, Pixel 3D
Professional, Bars & Pipes Professional, SuperJam!, ImageFX, TRexx
Professional, Toaster Toolkit 4000, and others can be added to the user's
Toaster working environment. Using Crouton Tools can vastly simplify thesse
(and many more) processes by allowing the user to easily move from program to
program. All of these powerful programs (plus many others) become a mouse
click away -- as if they were part of the Toasters functions!

Art Department Professional and Morph Plus from ASDG, ImageFX from GVP, and
ImageMaster from Black Belt are especially supported by Crouton Tools with
specifically designed utility modules. Functions supporting Art Department
Professional, for example, are DV1/DV2 Send, DV1/DV2 Send to JPEG, DV1/DV2
Save to JPEG, ToasterPaint Send to JPEG, ToasterPaint Save to JPEG, and
Universal Image Loader.

Crouton Tools will also allow the user to send images to DeluxePaint,
Brilliance, Pixel 3D Professioinal, Professional Page and PhonePak.

Third-party products used for digital audio (Studio 16), music (Bars & Pipes
Professional and SuperJam!), editing (AmiLink), single frame controllers,
time base correctors -- most major programs -- are supported. Crouton Tools
can even be customized to accept even more programs using TRexx Professional
and Toaster Toolkit 4000.

Crouton Tools is the first in a series of programs and tools which will be
part of The Scene Machine product line. These utilities will help the user
build complete scenes and execute these applications right from the Video
Toaster. Future programs of The Scene Machine Series will allow the user to
create sotryboards, log tapes, build graphics compositions, create sequences
for rotoscoping, compose background music for video, create edit lists and
perform comprehensive off-line, picture-based video editing (with sound).

Crouton Tools requires Workbench 2.0 or higher, Video Toaster 2.0, 7 MB or
more of memory. 2 MB of chip memory is helpful. TRexx Professional and/or
Toaster Toolkit 4000 is helpful as well.

DevWare will market Crouton Tools and The Scene Machine Series through its
DevWare Video division to end users and resellers. Atomic Toaster will
provide technical support and continued development of The Scene Machine
modules and other products for the Video Toaster.

DevWare, through its DevWare Video division, is an international licensor,
marketer and distributor of commercial software and instructional videotapes
relating to the Amiga computer and Desktop Video markets.

Atomic Toaster, located in Salt Lake City, UT, has more than 20 years of

Toaster systems for customers since the Video Toaster was introduced.

(______/evWare, Inc., the California-based direct marketer and distributor of
software and video tapes for the Amiga, announced that it has acquired the
international rights to exclusively distribute Toaster Toolkit 4000 from The
Byte Factory.

Toaster Toolkit 4000, a collection of six powerful and indispensable
utilities for the Video Toaster 2.0, Version 3.0, and Video Toaster 4000, was
released today at a list price of $179.95. The new version of Toaster Toolkit
4000 contains two new utility programs, as well as many improvements on the
original four.

The two newest programs in Toaster Toolkit 4000 are:

Color Font Converter allows the user to create full-color CG fonts from
DeluxePaint brushes.

FXToAnim allows the user to take an animated Toaster Effect and turn it into
a standard animation that can be edited with DeluxePaint, then turned back
into an effect with AnimFX.


Following are many new features included on the original four utilities.

Toaster Sequence Editor, now more powerful than any other Toaster-related
product, offers improved automation via a larger script window that displays
ARexx commands in plain English, the ability to control the Toaster's
genlock, an easy method to create FrameStore slideshows -- loading as well a
saving scripts in ARexx format, improved ARexx and Serial control scripts
execution time displayed, scripts can be printed, the on-screen video buss
buttons reflect the interface has been redesigned and better organized.

Standard features allow you to create Toaster scripts of any size to perform
any transition at variable speeds. Load, grab and save FrameStores. Display
CG Pages. Wait for time or GPI. Loop. Output speech, serial and text. Full
cut, copy paste and undo functions. Point-and-click graphical user interface
with actual effect crouton images.

AnimFX has improved creation of special effects. You can now create
high-resolution effects to help eliminate jaggies, soft-edge transitions that
can have 2, 4, 8 or 16 levels of transparency, and all effects you create are
freely distributable. Standard features allow you to convert animation into
real custom animated effects. Use DeluxePaint to build "organic" and
"action/sports" effects that run from the Switcher.

FrameStore Compressor improves conserving space. It now has a faster
compression routine, and a powerful FrameStore renumber facility allows you
to compress FrameStores with no loss of image quality. Use "snoop mode" for
unattended operation. Works with all Toaster software. Fast black-and-white
preview/IFF save, Delete and Rename FrameStores.

Toaster Project Editor allows for even better organization. It has been given
effect and project utilities.   Standard features allow you to create custom
Project files. Rearrange effects. Change effect speeds. Delete unwanted
effects. Add new effects. Load and save effect croutons. Create MacroFX to
run programs or scripts directly from the Switcher.

All programs in the Toaster Toolkit 4000 work under AmigaDOS versions 1.3
through 3.0 and run on all Amigas. ARexx is not required for any program but
can be used. Toaster Toolkit 4000 will transparently recognize which version
of the Video Toaster it is installed on.

DevWare will market Toaster Toolkit 4000 through its DevWare Video division.
Atomic Toater, based in Salt Lake City, UT, and now working with DevWare as
their Video Toaster sales and software development division, will handle
technical support for Toaster Toolkit 4000.

             DevWare Releases Mozart's Music Master Version 2.0

(______/evWare, Inc., the California-based direct marketer and distributor of
software and video tapes for the Amiga, announced that it has released
Mozart's Music Master Version 2.0 for the Amiga. Version 2.0 teaches simple
to complex time signatures, as well as making muic reading and learning
theory easy for the user. Its list price is $39.95.

Consistent with DevWare's product marketing philosophy of offering the best
product value for end users, it is feature laden, unique and lower-priced
than any competing product.

The newest version of Mozart's Music Master will teach the user musical
intervals on half-step and whole-step basis, test knowledge of key
signatures, teach simple meter, slow compound meter, and fast meter, dispaly
time signatures, graphically provide answers with the proper note values to
the proper amount of beats for the time signatures, and display up to eight
notes with all the time signature possibilities.

As with the first version, the user can:

  * Learn music note reading (note recognition) in four clefs (Treble,
    Alto, Tenor and Bass). A timer with three settings can be used to limit
    time for note identification. Right and wrong answers can be tallied
    and displayed.
  * Learn interval theory (recognition), which can also be a timed and
    scored activity.
  * Learn interval ear training.
  * Learn to identify the four standard scales and know their intervals.

(_/\_)ecently, Commodore elected to consolidate their state operations, thus
making them financially stronger.  One of the first steps taken was to
reduce their inventory in both the US and Canada.  In doing this, select
distributors were given the opportunity to purchase sizable amounts of new
and factory refurbished parts at extraordinarily low prices.  This section
contains new and refurbished items, which are indicated by the letters "N"
or "R" to the left of each product,  Refurbished does not mean used or
pre-owned, but simply factory remanufactured.  Some units may have minor
imperfections such as scratches or, in the case of some monitors, faulty
front doors.  With the exception of a minor imperfection, if any, most
everything appears "mint" and of course everything carries a full 90 day
warranty.  This is your opportunity to purchase Amiga/Commodore parts and
equipment at up to 80% less than an authorized dealer pays.

The *StarShip* 5-MINUTE News is providing this information to you as a
service, not as an advertisement.  These prices are NEWS, and some of the
items on the lists of equipment haven't even been available for some time.
As I understand it, there were TONS and TONS, literally, of equipment
involved in this special purchase by The Grapevine Group.  In weight, not
in a figure of speech.  You figure out what half a million pounds is in
tons, and picture each of the boxes with a Commodore logo on it.  Yes,
NOW you have the picture.

Many thanks to JBEE for typing this information in and providing it to us.

Here's your chance to save big!
