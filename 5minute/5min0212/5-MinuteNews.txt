               UK's Rombo Productions' Vidi-Amiga 12 Digitiser
    ____       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / _  )           Livingston, Scotland -- February 1993
  /   _/
 / /\ \
(_/  \_)ombo Productions Ltd, annouces USA availability of their best-selling
Amiga color digitiser, Vidi-Amiga 12, at a suggested retail price of $179.00.

If you want the ultimate quality images at a price you can afford then there
is only one choice... Vidi-Amiga 12. The video digitiser that all the others
follow!

Compatible with ALL Amigas, the Vidi-Amiga 12 now supports all the new A1200
modes, and software upgrades will be available to existing users.

What's causing all the stir in the UK, is now available in the US.

Yes, you've guessed it! Vidi-Amiga 12 from Rombo Productions is the best and
most affordable color digitiser ever! This isn't just our opinion, it's also
one of every UK Amiga journalist...

"Vidi 12 gives unequalled results or anything within 200 pounds (or $300) of
its price. Forget the competition. If you can afford Vidi 12, buy it. It you
can't aford it, borrow it from someone who can."

                               Mat Broomfield, CU Amiga, January 1992 issue

"Vidi Amiga 12.. The best value digitizer on the market."

                           Jason Holburn, Amiga Format, December 1992 issue

"I compared the Rombo and Digiview digitisers extensively. To summarize them,
I judged the Rombo results to be more consistent and to have the edge on
quality."
                            Alan Puzey, Amiga User Int., January 1992 issue

Vidi-Amiga 12 is without doubt one of the most exciting peripheral
breakthroughs on the Amiga platform ever. It has brought the world of video
captures and its applications within reach of any Amiga owner and is
compatible with all Amigas.

Version 2.00 supports most new 1200 modes.

           SMPTE & Toaster Modules for SunRize Industries Studio 16
  ____     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 / ___)              Campbell, CA -- February 5, 1993
( (__
 \__ \
 ___) )
(____/unRize Industries has just introduced three optional modules for Studio
16. They include:

SMPTE Output              A combination SMPTE generator/monitor that also
                          outputs LTC time code on the Amiga's audio out.

Toaster Handler - AD1012  Allows you to play one or two tracks while
                          performing a Video Toaster transition.

Toaster Handler - AD516   Allows you to play one or two tracks while
                          performing a Video Toaster transition.

SunRize has also shipped their new completed Studio 16 Users Manual to
registered owners of the AD1012 and AD 516. It is complete with diagrams and
screen shots, and all original appendices have been updated. There are
additions to the chapter on trouble shooting and a brand new appendix on
using Studio 16 with Bars & Pipes Professional.

SMPTE Output Module

The first in a line of expansion modules for Studio 16, SMPTE Output is a
software only addition to Studio 16 that provides capabilities not included
in the base Studio 16 package.

SMPTE Output allows Studio 16 to stripe time code onto a tape, or generate
time code in real time. One result of this is that Studio 16 can now act as a
master. Your external VTRs or ATRs can lock to Studio 16 (an external
synchronizer is required to do this). SMPTE Output combines the SMPTE
generator and SMPTE monitor with the ability to generate LTC time code out of
our Amiga's audio out jack.

 o  Stripe your tapes with SMPTE time code
 o  Multiple (4) reset/set points for quickly jumping to new time code
 o  Locks to video sync (requires Amiga genlock or Video Toaster for this
    feature)
 o  Type directly into SMPTE monitor
 o  Fast forward, rewind, play, and pause buttons
 o  Drop frame or non-drop frame
 o  List Price $249.00


Video Toaster Handlers

Although Studio 16 multitasks fine with the Video Toaster, the Toaster turns
off multitasking while performing digial video effects. This will cause
Studio 16 audio to stop playing during the transition. These new Toaster
Handlers replace your existing software device drivers, allowing you to play
one or two tracks while simultaneously performing a Toaster effect. Available
for both the AD516 and AD1012, these drivers configure your card to buffer
more data in the card. This allows the Amiga to disable multitasking for
several seconds while Studio 16 audio plays. The result is that you have
fewer playback tracks (only one or two), but you can play audio during many
of the Video Toaster effects.

The AD1012 Toaster Handler also includes two 128K RAM chips to enlarge the
buffer on the AD1012. The AD516 already has 128K RAM chips standard.

The AD1012 and AD516 Video Toaster Handlers are sold separately. List price
is $249.00.

Special offers through March 31, 1993

Studio 16 / AD516             $1495.00
Studio 16 / AD1012              595.00
SMPTE Output Module (*)         139.00 (Regularly $249.00)
AD1012 Toaster Handler (*)      139.00 (Regularly $249.00)
AD516 Toaster Handler (*)       139.00 (Regularly $249.00)

(*) The SMPTE Output and Toaster Handler offer is available only with the
purchase of an AD516 or AD1012, or to registered Studio 16 owners.

turns out to be a gripping challenge in creativity, hand and mind
corrdination. Using the mouse, a black marble is guided through elaborate
mazes. Anytime an Oxyd is touched by the marble it opens up, revealing its
hidden pattern or color. Two Oxyds within a landscape will carry identical
patterns. When the Oxyds of the same pattern are opened sequentially they
remain open. If no match is made, the previously opened Oxyd closes again.

Once all its Oxyds have been opened, a landscape is saved and the player
advances to the next one. In this way, 100 (!) single-player landscapes and
the same number of dual-player landscapes have to be solved. Although the
game mechanics are easiy understood there are no quick fixes or simplisic
approaches to the intricate puzzles presented in Oxyd. Every landscape
introduces new game elements which may be explored and studied in a playful
way. Weeks of fun and many sleepless nights are the likely result.

In the initial landscapes the Oxyds are easily accessible, but they become
more and more difficult to reach as the player progresses. Objects inside the
maze have to be moved and puzzles solved in order to open secret passages to
the Oxyds. Laser beams may be reflacted by mirrors and prisms in order to
touch an Oxyd. One-way streets and traps are frequently encountered as are
the Death-heads and flying rotors that will destroy the marble instantly.
Oxyd offers a fascinating variety of objects and technical effects which may
or may not contribute to the solution of a particular puzzle.

Great fun and excitement comes from the multitude of surfaces encountered
throughout the game. These may consist of tiles differing in texture,
curvature and the amount of friction generated as the marble moves across
them, as well as swampy and icy areas, deep chasms, raised or sunken passage
ways. A number of objects may be pricked up by rolling over them with the
marble. There's a sledge-hammer which lets the player break down certain wall
sections to gain access to adajacent rooms. The hammer may also be used to
create other useful tools, but that's for the player to find out.

Mediation Landscapes

Every tenth level is a mediation landscape presenting the player with
exciting challenges to hand and mind coordination. No Oxyds need to be opened
in these levels, instead there are four steel balls which have to be placed
in pits provided on the game board. The tricky part is that mouse movements
affect all balls simultaneously. Depending on the surface friction
encountered some balls are accelerated more than others and it takes a lot of
practise to keep them all under control. Before you know it, one of them has
fallen off the edge of the board.

Ramps and parabolic surfaces, electrical charges, magnetic fields and black
holes can play havoc with the steel balls but these same effects may be
employed in solving the puzzle.

The Linked Game

Oxyd is even more fun when two computers are linked via MIDI, modem, null
modem cable or Appletalk, and the dual-player mode is used. The linked game
provides 100 additional levels where one player receives the black marble and
his/her partner controls the white one. The two-player landscapes have been
specifically designed for this purpose, giving the players an additional game
at no extra cost. Unlike other linked games, Oxyd requires that the players
cooperate in order to solve levels and ultimately win the game together.

The linked game provides each player with a view of the area surrounding
his/her marble, making it possible for the players to explore different areas
of a particular labyrinth and share the information. Somtimes a marble may
have to be sacrificed if this lets the other player finish the level
successfully.

Technical Realization

In conjunction with the appropriate sound effects, Oxyd achieves a
surprisingly realistic feel for the physical effects like friction,
collision, gravity or magnetism. Super precision mouse controls make pushing
the marble around the different levels an extra-sensory experience.

Dongleware Distribution

The Oxyd game software is distributed as "Dongleware." Anyone may copy and
distribute the Oxyd disk containing the complete game, 100 game levels and
100 dual player levels. The first 10 levels of Oxyd may be played free of
charge. After that, the player will need the 176 page Oxyd Book to continue
playing. The Oxyd Book contains useful hints and information about Oxyd as
well as the secret magic formulas with which the Magic Tokens can be removed
when they are encountered in the game. Magic Tokems have a tendency to appear
in certain bottle necks within a level, effectively blocking the player's
path. When a secret formula is cast at them, the Magic Tokens vanish, thus
opening a passage.

 |  Oxyd is a slightly different kind of shareware since the game itself |
 |  is essentially 10 free levels, with 90 more that can be accessed     |
 |  through a code book ordered for the fee, with ordering information   |
 |  available within the program itself. Oxyd is a game developed over   |
 |  the last ten years by Meinolf Schneider that's available on all      |
 |  major platforms. It's an arcade-style game with elements that        |
 |  suggest Arkanoid and Roll-On at times, pattern and maze oriented     |
 |  with satisfying sound effects. There are laser lights to switch on   |
 |  and off and dynamite and bombs to explode to clear paths. Sometimes  |
 |  the problem with a level is figuring out what the problem is, some-  |
 |  times its a matter of speed and sometimes just a matter of           |
 |  coordination. A responsive trackball can help -- "mouse-trak" is     |
 |  superb. Every 10 levels there is a meditation level that requires    |
 |  an extra degree of muscle control.                                   |
 |                                                                       |
 |  Unlike some games with multiple layers, this one doesn't seem to     |
 |  aspire to the impossible, with each level more difficult than the    |
 |  next. Each has a different kind of problem and visual design, and    |
 |  builds on skills and knowledge gained as early as the first layers.  |
 |  Oxyd allows a "quit and save" option which, if you've noted the      |
 |  level number in the past 10, allows for a direct return. Oxyd can    |
 |  also be played as a 2 player game by null-modem or on-line (the      |
 |  screen resolutions must match).                                      |
 |                                                                       |
 |  Copies of the Oxyd Book are available from the BCS Amiga PD Library. |
