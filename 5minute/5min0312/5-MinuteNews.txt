(____)n Commodore news, David Archambeault, formerly Vice President of
Marketing for Commodore U.S., has left the company, reportedly to accept a
better job offer from Time/Warner. "Archy," as he was called, was highly
visible at Amiga trade shows and widely known among Amiga developers and
journalists.

He had been with Commodore since the early days of the Amiga, coming to the
company from Cherry Lane (music) Publishing. His replacement (if any) is not
known at this time.

The *StarShip* wishes Archy well in future endeavors.

                 SoftWood Shipping FinalCopy II Release 2

(_/inalCopy II Release 2 from SoftWood, Inc. has new features. At a glance,
the only apparent difference is that the words Release 2 appear in the title
bar, but just look what you get!

  o Landscape printing
  o Type-1 font support
  o Compugraphic font support
  o Automatic font downloading during PostScript printing
  o A3 and A5 page sizes

Landscape Printing

Printing a page sideways is called printing in landscape mode. Release 1 of
FinalCopy could only print in portrait mode. Landscape printing lets you print
a document whose page size is as wide as your paper is tall. FinalCopy II will
automatically decide whether you want to print in portrait or landscape mode
by looking at how you have defined your page size. Any page whose width is
greater than its height, and whose print width is greater than 8 inches will
be printed in landscape mode.

Type-1 Font Support

Release 1 of FinalCopy only supported a font format called NimbusQ. The font
engine now also supports Type-1 format fonts. NimbusQ fonts are every bit as
good as Type-1 fonts. However, Type-1 fonts are recognized as the industry
standard for outline fonts.

This font format is the one most used on Macintosh computers, and is the
format stored in the PostScript laser printers. To use a Type-1 font in
FinalCopy, you simply open it just as you do any other FinalCopy font. Type-1
fonts are displayed on screen as well as printed on graphic and PostScript
printers.

Compugraphic Font Support

Release 2 of FinalCopy now supports the Amiga standard outline font format
called Compugraphic. Although this font format is inferior to both NimbusQ and
Type-1 in speed, flexibility, file size, appearance, and PostScript
compatibility, it nonetheless has been forced upon Amiga users as the
"standard" for the Amiga. If you have Compugraphic fonts, you can now use them
in FinalCopy. To use a Compugraphic font, simply open the fonts ".font" file
just as you do any other FinalCopy font. You will find using Compugraphic
fonts with FinalCopy superior to using Compugraphic fonts on other Amiga word
processors in terms of speed and print quality. However, to use Compugraphic
fonts and FinalCopy, you must have Workbench 2.1 or greater, and you must be
using a hard drive. Finally, if you intend to print a document to a PostScript
printer, do not use Compugraphic fonts. This limitation is due to the poor
PostScript compatibility inherent in the Compugraphic font format.

Automatic Font Downloading During PostScript Printing

If you are using any NimbusQ or Type-1 fonts in your document that are not on
your PostScript printer, FinalCopy II automatically downloads the fonts for
you when the document is printed. Now any of the SoftFaces fonts you use will
automatically be sent to the printer -- you will not need to manually download
these fonts ever again. This new feature only applies if you are printing a
document to a PostScript printer or file.

A3 and A5 Page Sizes

These European page sizes have been added to the Page Setup requester.

For more information and details on the upgrade path from earlier releases of
FinalCopy, contact your local Amiga dealer or SoftWood Inc., P.O. Box 50178,
Phoenix, AZ 85087 or call 800/247-8330, fax 602/431-8361.

(____)inux is a FREE version of Unix compatible with SysVr4, POSIX, and BSD.
It is available with source code for 386 and better Intel based computers and
soon for Amiga and other 680x0 computers. Here is the FAQ for 680x0 machines.

From: "Linux Activists" <uunet!Niksula.hut.fi!linux-activists>

The Official...
New and Improved...
Environmentally Friendly...
680x0 Linux FAQ (TM)
[Now legal in 40 states]

ABOUT THIS FAQ

This FAQ is intended to provide general information on the 680x0 Linux port
project which is currently underway. Mainly, it's an attempt to cut down on
the flow of email that inevitably comes in every time I post something about
the project. ;)

WHEN WILL 680x0 LINUX BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC?

I don't know. A couple months, maybe. We're working hard on it at this point,
and advancing leaps and bounds (and a few stumbles). There's really no point
to releasing the current system to the public. It's not useful, and only
occasionally even mildly entertaining. ;)

WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE PORT?

We're still working on the basic kernel at this point. The scheduler, memory
management code, interrupt code, filesystem code, and handful of drivers have
been implemented. There's not much to see right now. The system comes up and
goes through some of the startup process, then sits there and idles at you. ;)

WHAT PLATFORMS WILL IT RUN ON?

The Amiga port project is the only effort to port Linux to a 680x0 platform
that I'm aware of. However, we are paying attention to portability where
possible. It is our intention to cooperate with other groups willing to work
with us.

I expect that once we make our first public release of the system, several
groups will begin porting our sources to various platforms. Interest has been
shown by Atari programmers, mostly. There are also a few people hoping to
bring Linux up on Sun 3's. I haven't heard from any Macintosh folks. In all
probability only the startup code, interrupt code, and drivers will need
re-writing to get the system running on these systems, or any others with the
necessary basic hardware.

I'm aware that the phrase "necessary basic hardware" begs some explanation.
Simply put, that would be a machine with a 68020+68851, 68030 (non-EC model),
or 68040 processor, at least a couple megs of RAM, a good amount of hard disk
space, and obviously some form of text i/o device (i.e. you technically don't
even need a display and keyboard if you can plug a terminal into it).

There _has_ been talk of a port that could run on non-MMU-equipped machines as
well, though it would lack the obvious features inherent in a memory-managed
operating system (e.g. true virtual memory, memory protection). There is
currently no effort underway to implement such a system that I'm aware of.

HOW COMPATIBLE WILL IT BE WITH OTHER SYSTEMS?

We, of course, hope that 680x0 Linux will be compatible (at the source level)
with 80x86 Linux, as well as many other Unix or Unix-like systems. Linux is
POSIX.1 compliant, which helps quite a bit with porting software to it.

Binary compatibility with _any_ OS other than 680x0 Linux ports is highly
unlikely.

WILL X WINDOWS BE AVAILABLE FOR 680x0 LINUX?

I get this question a lot, so I figured it's worth having its own section. The
answer is yes... probably... eventually. ;)

WILL THE AMIGA PORT RUN UNDER OR EMULATE AMIGADOS?

No. Actually, the latter is a possibility, I guess.

WHAT ABOUT MACH?

              MegageM Releases FractalPro 6.0 with AGA Support
    _  _      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   / \/ \             Santa Maria, CA -- March 8, 1993
  /      \
 / /\  /\ \
(_/  \/  \_)egageM is pleased to announce FractalPro Version 6.0. FractalPro
is the only professional quality tool for creating beautiful fractal art and
animations on the Amiga and Version 6.0 takes FractalPro a giant leap forward
into the future of the Amiga's new Advanced Graphics Architecture systems.
FractalPro 6.0 builds on the existing capabilities of stunning HAM6 and 24-bit
rendering, twelve types of automatic animation sequencing, ARexx and JAH
script control, and optimized assembly language algorithms for blazing speed,
VistaPro DEM output, and post-render script execution capabilities of earlier
versions. We've added the most user-requested new features and some of our
own ideas to create the most advanced fractal art and animation package
available on any platform. FractalPro 6.0 retains compatibility for loading
images and coordinate files from FractalPro 4.0, 5.0 and 5.1.

What really makes FracalPro 6.0 the greatest fractal tool ever is the
extensive set of new features:

  Triple User Interface:

   o Attractive 'beveled' button control panel for 80 program features
     and operations
   o Menus with keyboard shortcuts duplicate almost all control panel
     functions
   o ARexx/JAH script control for fully automated operation of FractalPro 6.0

  Extensive support for new Amiga AGA chip set systems:

   o Video resolutions from 320x200 to 1536x480 NTSC, and 320x256 to
     1536x592 PAL
   o Two degrees of overscan for video resolutions
   o MultiSync resolutions including 640x480, 1024x768, 640x800, 640x1024
   o Dedicated Video Toaster-specific 376x482 (HAM6) and 752x482 24-bit
   o Direct Firecracker24 support in both lo-res and hi-res, interlaced and
     non-interlaced NTSC
   o DCTV compatible 736x480 resolution
   o HAM6, HAM8, 256-color, and 24-bit Coloring Modes in any resolution
   o Zoom, color cycling, palette controls, and full animation sequencing
     in any mode
   o Compatible with ESC Amiga systems, too (limited to HAM6 and 24-bit)

  Enhanced File Handling:

   o Load/Save IFF images, XYW coordinate files, and Color Palette files

(___)(__)EAR YEA! HEAR YEA! HEAR YEA! We at Accursed Toys are proud to
announce the new and improved Boppin' offer!

Yes, we buckled down and created a truly mesmerizing offer! Now, for an
unlimited time only, you can purchase Boppin' direct from Accursed Toys for
the amazing low price of $24.95! And what's more we will throw in the Doctor
Who game and the Laboratory of Life absolutely free! And best of all, you can
now purchase Boppin' with a personal check! Yes, you heard right! We have
reached an agreement with our Bank so that personal checks will now be
accepted with only the usual 3 business day wait at which time we will
promptly ship you not only Boppin', but Doctor Who and Laboratory of Life.

YES! It's absolutely amazing! Just imagine, you have been thinking of getting
Boppin' (for the kids of course ;-) but you didn't want to go to all that
hassle of going down to the bank, buying a cashier's check or money order made
out to Stephen P. Lepisto, laying down the fee for that check or money order,
dropping it in an envelope with a note requesting Boppin' and the free copy of
Doctor Who and Laboratory of Life, sticking Accursed Toys address on it (470
Mt. Defiance Cir. SW, Issaquah, WA 98027-3629), and dropping it in the post
box. No, no, no!  Now all you have to do is make out your personal check for
$24.95, payable to Stephen P. Lepisto, add it to a note requesting Boppin' et
al in an envelope, and sending that to:

                              Accursed Toys
                        470 Mt. Defiance Cir. SW
                        Issaquah, WA  98027-3629

We will almost promptly send out Boppin' (and Doctor Who and Laboratory of
Life) to you! Please be sure to include your mailing address.
