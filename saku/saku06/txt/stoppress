Tämä on pienen (?) miehen pieni tarina siitä, mitä tapahtui vappuna -94.

{1Lauantai, 30.5.1994 - Vappuaatto

Vappuaatosta huolimatta loggauduin Vaasa Freeporttiin ja tein normaalit
askareeni, luin postini ja vastailin, sekä menin IRCiin. #amiga:n aiheena
oli "It's dead, Jim", mutta muilta kanavilta löytyi tuttuja nimiä, joten
menin muualle. Vähän ajan kuluttua siirryin lukemaan Usenettiä, jossa oli
vastassa surullinen näky, Commodore oli haettu konkurssiin, ei vielä
kokonaan, mutta uutisista päätellen lisää olisi luvassa. Uutinen ei ollut
kovinkaan vanha.

Commodore's gone. <sniff> Completely. Voluntary liquidation. Meaning there
won't be _anyone_ making the Amiga any more. ::sigh:: Reported by three
seperate news agencies, CBM apparently made this announcement just this
evening (April 29th, Friday).

Hot off the wires, after the close of business on Friday, Commodore made an
announcement. Here are the stories carried on PRNewswire, AP News and
Reuters for *StarShip* members information.

               COMMODORE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED TO LIQUIDATE

NEW YORK, April 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Commodore International Limited (NYSE:
CBU) announced today that its Board Of Directors has authorized the
transfer of its assets to trustees for the benefit of its creditors and has
placed its major subsidiary, Commodore Electronics Limited, into voluntary
liquidation. This is the initial phase of an orderly liquidation of both
companies, which are incorporated in the Bahamas, by the Bahamas Supreme
Court.

  Commodore Folds

By DINAH WISENBERG BRIN
 Associated Press Writer

   WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) -- Commodore International Ltd., a pioneer in the
personal computer industry, said late Friday it is going out of business.

   The company plans to transfer its assets to unidentified trustees "for
the benefit of its creditors" and has placed its major subsidiary,
Commodore Electronics Ltd., into voluntary liquidation.

   "This is the initial phase of an orderly voluntary liquidation of both
companies," Commodore said in a brief statement.

   Company executives could not immediately be reached Friday evening.

   The company last month reported an $8.2 million loss for the quarter
ending Dec. 31 on sales of $70.1 million. A year earlier, Commodore lost
$77.2 million on sales of $237.7 million in the same period.

   In the latest report, Commodore said financial limits had thwarted its
ability to supply products, leading to weakened sales. One of its new
products, the Amiga CD32 video game, had sold poorly in Europe, where the
company did most of its business.

   The company's net worth turned negative in the fiscal year ended last
June 30.
   Its stock, which had traded at around $3 per share before the quarterly
results were announced last month, closed unchanged at 87 1/2 cents per
share on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.

   "This is a company that briefly captured the attention of the American
market and didn't go where the market was going," said David Coursey,
editor of the newsletter P.C. Letter in San Mateo, Calif. "They just never
managed to change with the marketplace."

   While grabbing some market share and attention in the late 1970s,
Commodore's products were something between PCs and game machines "and
never quite became either," Coursey said.

   Commodore started 40 years ago as a typewriter repair company in the
Bronx. Its extension to the adding machine business paved the way for it to
make calculators and then personal computers by the mid-1970s.

   Commodore competed with Radio Shack for the first computers sold to
homes and co-founder Jack Tramiel became a highly-regarded figure in the
fledgling PC industry.

   By the early 1980s, it was overshadowed in the PC business by Apple
Computer Inc. and IBM. Software manufacturers didn't create as much
software for Commodore's Amiga line as it did for Apple and IBM-compatible
machines.

   In recent years, most of Commodore's business was in Europe.

   NewTek Inc. of Topeka, Kan., created a product called Video Toaster that
converted Commodore's Amiga to a video-editing system. The $2,500 product
was popular with small advertising agencies and home hobbyists. The
company's phones were busy Friday night.

the transfer of its assets to trustees for the benefit of its creditors and

Alkujärkytys meni ohi, siirryin takaisin IRCiin #amiga-kanavalle. Nyt
tajusin aiheen lohduttoman merkityksen, tuntui kuin kaikki olisi mennyt.
Paria päivää aikaisemmin olin lukenut C=:n henkilöstövähennyksistä, lähes
koko kehitystiimi oli erotettu. #amiga:lla keskustelu oli sekavaa, monet
USA:laiset olivat tapansa mukaan valvoneet koko yön ja kello näytti siellä
kuutta aamulla. Kellään ei ollut muuta tietoa kuin Bahamalta lähtöisin
oleva raportti.

Kolme tuntia myöhemmin olin jälleen Internetin uumenissa, nyt löysin jo
pari viestiä, joissa kerrottiin entisten C=:n työntekijöiden sanomisista.
Näitten kertomusten aitous oli kuitenkin hyvin arvelluttavaa. Nyt #amigalla
oli hillitön meno, tuntui kuin kaikki olisivat myymässä Amigaansa ja
ostamassa heti uutta. Suomalaiset olivat juhlimassa vappuaattoa, mutta
roikuin IRCissä lähes kolme tuntia (TELEn pojat hyppivät riemusta.. ;-) )



{1Sunnuntai 1.5.1994 - Vappupäivä - krapulapäivä

Edellisen illan juhlinnan jälkeen pystyin jälleen raahautumaan koneeni
ääreen ja soitin jälleen Vaasa Freeporttiin. (Linjat ovat muuten hyvin
vapaita vappuna, vinkkinä vaan kaikille ;-) )

Usenetistä löytyi kymmeniä viestejä, jotka kaikki kertoivat Commodoren
tilanteen samalla tavalla. Seasta löytyi kuitenkin jo paljon arvailuja ja
erityisesti liikuttavia nyyhkytarinoita siitä, miten C= oli muuttanut
heidän elämäänsä PETin ajoista asti. Löytyipä sieltä muutamia hauskojakin
kannanottoja ja mielipiteitä. Iltaa kohden mielialat kohenivat ja
positiiviset arvailut täyttivät jälleen netin.

{1Maanantai 2.5.1994 - Vapun jälkeinen toinen krapulapäivä

Käytyäni koulussa (Miten joku jaksaa siellä vielä käydä tähän aikaan
vuodesta?!? En muista mitään koko päivästä..) olin jälleen lukemassa
Usenettiä ja seurasin IRCin keskustelua, IRCissä mielialat olivat
kohonneet, Suomi - USA jääkiekko-ottelun tulokset tulivat sinne
reaaliajassa ja enää muutamat jaksoivat miettiä koneensa vaihtoa.

Usenetistä löysin jotain uuttakin, mm. Jim Drew:n (Utilities Unlimitedin
kuuluisan Emplantin tekijä) kirjoittama pätkä. Jim on kasaamassa
kehittelijöitä, jotka olisivat kiinnostuneita ostamaan oikeudet Amigaan.
Ostajat saisivat kukin rakentaa oman Amigansa PC:n tyyliin. Mukana on jo
mm. Dave Haynie ja muutkin ovat osoittaneet jo mielenkiintoaan.

Vaikka Amigan kohtalo onkin nyt vaakalaudalla, ei kaikki ole suinkaan
mennyt. Maailmassa on yhä miljoonia Amigoita ja niiden käyttäjät
tarvitsevat yhä ohjelmia ja lisälaitteita. Kehitys ei suinkaan tule jäämään
tähän, vaan uutta riittää varmasta vuosikausiksi. Commodore on nyt mennyt,
mutta tämä voi olla kaiken kauniin alku. Parhaiten asia sujuu odottamalla
vähän ja odottaa lisäuutisia maailmalta, liike-elämässä mikään ei ole kovin
selvää. Oma A4000/040:seni tulee olemaan käytössä vielä vuosia, enkä näe
mitään syytä vaihtaa pois.

Ja tässä olisi alkuperäinen lainaus Jim Drew viestistä:

Attention Amiga developers and interested parties...
 
After speaking with Mike Levin (CSM hall of fame) tonight on CIS (and via
the phone), we have come to several conclusions about possible solutions
to a panic'd public and potential loss of the most powerful home computer
made to date (that's the Amiga folks).  He suggested that I lead the
attempt to purchase the rights to the Amiga hardware.  Rights that would
be purchased by all parties and made available to all parties.
 
I would like to hear from developers who would be interested in still
developing for the Amiga, or anyone who would like to support this effort
in general.
 
Nico, I know you hate me and are probably laughing at all of this, but
all feelings aside, you are a damn good programmer (Scala wouldn't have
you otherwise) and I hope that you will continue to develope for our
machine.
 
Same goes for you Dan (Babcock).... you don't like me anymore than Nico
does, but you too know your stuff and could be very beneficial to what is
about to unfold.
 
People can think what they want of me, my statements, my comments... to
me, that's been very good to see... my corporation, my products, and
myself have been changed a lot from the responses I have seen here,
GEnie, and on CompuServe.  My persistance has paid off.  Because of
EMPLANT's success, I will never have to work another day in my life.
 
I am willing to put everything on the line.  I believe in this machine,
the platform, and the people (even though we bicker like a bunch of old
hens sometimes).  On behalf of the Amiga's continued existance, I am
asking for you support.  Let's all make some noise about the Amiga. 
Commodore kept it the best computing secret of all time, I think it's
time to let the cat of the bag.
 
I will be in contact with ALL of the major 3rd party Amiga peripheral
corporations tomorrow, also asking for their support.  If we can somehow
form a public corporation and obtain the rights to the Amiga hardware, we
can make the Amiga work.
 
My goals for this project are...
 
Obtain information concerning current ownership rights of the Amiga
hardware design, and other important peripherals.  From what information
I have heard (and have had gathered by noisy attorneys), the rights were
transferred to 'trustees' for holding.  If this is true, there very well
may be some interesting legal problems involved here, since the
technology behind the Amiga is the only real asset that Commodore Intl
had less...that would leave an empty shell for the creditors to pick
through.
 
Purchase the rights from current ownership, or work with another
corporation to see that continued development and *gasp* advertising is
done.
 
Contact major MAC and PC developers (Adobe, Aldus, etc.) and once again
offer to port their products to the Amiga at little or no cost.  Once
people see *us* running the big boys software more efficiently than other
platforms can, they will think hard before buying that next MAC or PC
system.
 
Continued developer support.  I plan to have CATS revived, and I hope
that Carolyn and the rest of the original team will be interested in
doing this.
 
Continued devlopment of new machines.  One thing I have learned in
producing hardware is how to cut costs.  EMPLANT is cheap to make... and
it is *still* made in the US (this is important to me).  Another thing I
learned is that the short time I spent talking with Dave Haynie, he is
alright in my book.  We chatted for about 30 minutes at one of the WOC
shows, and he is as sincere about the continued development as I am.  I
definately want Dave and the original crew back working together.  I
would hate to see a bunch of new comers (I am not oppose to new ideas
brought out by new people), but right now we need a dedicated team going
to get things done in a flash.  New people come with success.
 
Remove the poor publicity.  The only advertising Commodore got was bad. 
Dealers wanted to kill them... developers wanted to kill them.. all due
to the poor management.  The only way to do this is to rid the Commodore
name.
 
So you're asking "what's in it for Jim?".  Gratification.  As I stated
before, I could wash my hands clean of this situation and walk.  I don't
want to.  There is a pile of money to be made for everyone, and more
importantly a computer to be saved from extinction.  I know a lot of
Amiga developers have made themselves rich with the Amiga, and some would
like to forget it... I think that is selfish.  I for one, am willing to
give back to what made me where I am today.
 
So, in closing, I would like to thank those people who have sent me
incouragement letters, and even hate mail.  :-)  I am stubborn (I think
you'll *all* agree on this one... perhaps a usenet first?) and I can use
this to our advantage, obtain the rights to the machine, make these right
publically available (anyone could produce the machine ala PC clones),
and see this thing through... or I'll end up on the street trying...
 
If you are a developer, no matter how small and you have an interest in
supporting the Amiga, please FAX my office (602) 453-6407  (we have boxes
of fax paper).  If we do not succeed in obtaining the rights to the
Amiga, and someone else does... a huge list of developers wanting to
support the platform would be a big incentive to keep the product alive. 
I really don't care who makes the machine, as long as it is made (and
promoted this time around).
 
Thanks for your attention,
 
Sincerely,
 
Jim Drew - Utilities Unlimited International, Inc.
