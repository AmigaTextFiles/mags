their titles include &quot;sixth sense investigations&quot; (1998) and &quot;virtual gp&quot;
(1999). One of their biggest hits on the Amiga platform was &quot;foundation
directors cut&quot; (1999). Apart from their own titles, e.pi.c. also creates
ports of titles on other platforms such as the classic adventure game
&quot;simon the sorcerer II&quot; and the realtime strategy hit &quot;earth 2140&quot;.

&quot;Boxikon&quot;, &quot;Piles O' Tiles&quot;, and &quot;Pegger&quot;. All three are puzzle games with
superb graphics and presentation layout. In its upcoming releases, e.p.i.c.

&quot;The Amiga in its classic form was a dream come true for developers and
users alike&quot;, said Thomas Steiding, General Manager and one of the founders
of e.p.i.c. &quot;Most of our employees started their careers with Amiga and
remain diehard fans. We look forward to creating the same kind of
excitement on the PDA platform.&quot;
</P>
<P>
&quot;e.p.i.c. has been an excellent partner and has created some premier
content for Amiga&quot; said Bill McEwen, President and CEO of Amiga, Inc. &quot;We
look forward to their active participation as they translate their gaming
expertise from the desktop to the handheld market.&quot;

The market for video games in the United States, which includes arcade, PC,
console, and online gaming, is currently estimated to be worth $11 billion.
The AmigaDE platform allows developers to create game applications that

applications to migrate seamlessly from cell phones and handheld devices to
set-top boxes and up to desktop machines and servers.
