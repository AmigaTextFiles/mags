<H2>3. Ank&uuml;ndigung: &raquo;Betatester II&laquo;-Programm und -Konferenz [englisch]</H2>
<P><B>Thendic-France (<A HREF="http://www.thendic-france.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.thendic-france.com</A>) informiert:</B></P>
<P>
&raquo;The Betatester Program has been very successful and we need to acknowledge
the reliable support we have received from most of our Betatesters for the
Pegasos and MorphOS. Thanks!
</P>
<P>
Of course, we also have to thank the Core MorphOS Development Team who in
some cases for years have worked diligently to push MorphOS to a state
suitable for commercial release.
</P>
<P>
We have decided that the best way to say thank you and the best way to get
&quot;back to the future&quot; as fast as possible is to bring everyone to one place.
So we are going to do that!
</P>
<P>
If you are a Core MorphOS Developer, a Qualified Betatester, or a Phase II
Betatester (to be explained) we will organize and cover your travel and
lodging expenses to the Betatester II Conference in Frankfurt, Germany. The
Conference is currently scheduled for 12 October. We understand that we
need to push the date back so that plans can be made and we can maximize
the opportunity to make this gathering as meaningful and productive as
possible. The new date will be 14-15 December at the Hilton Hotel,
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P><B>Get ready! M-Day is here!</B></P>
1. On 12 October version 1.0 of MorphOS will be released to all Betatesters.<BR>
2. The week of 13 October the Pegasos Betatester mainboard will be released to Resellers. It is STILL a &quot;Betatester.&quot;<BR>
3. On 12 October Phase II of Team Betatester will begin.<BR>

We will present the strategic plan for MorphOS, the Pegasos and the
eclipsis.

<P>
We will present the first peripheral devices: a wireless camera, a smart
card reader, and the DataPlay disc drive. They will all work with the
Pegasos and depending on what activity each Betatester is involved with in
the future these devices will be given to Betatesters for
testing/development. All Betatesters will receive the Thendic card reader
and a Betatester Smart Card that enables secure FTP access to the
Betatester II application library and loyalty program.
</P>
<P>
We will also award 1000 Euros for the best program ported to MorphOS, the
best Demo, and the best hardware innovation presented at the Conference.
The results will be determined by a popular vote of the 100
Developers/Betatesters present and the Thendic/bplan Team. Each person has
one vote.
</P>
<P>
The Conference begins at 1000 14 December. The formal presentations begin
