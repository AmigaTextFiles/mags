<H2>14. Neue Video-Software im Anmarsch: VideoFX</H2>

<P>
&#187;VideoFX
<P>
An instant start for the Professional VideoProduction with Amiga
<P>
Makes it easy to integrate your Video productions with effects, slides and
audio samples. Even more this CD includes the best of the ClassX !
<P>
The name "VideoFX" suggests that this program is meant for videos and video
effects. But VideoFX is far more than this. In the beginning our aim was to
create a program that could offer users a more flexible and automatic
system to create videos. We wanted a program able to play animations and
show images in an only environment. In other words, we wanted to create a
program easy to be used.
We wanted our program to be able to launch animations simply by pressing a
key.
<P>
These ideas would have created a very useful program since it would have
allowed the user to set up videos without getting mad with two or three
animation players, stop/still operations on the video recorders, etc...
<P>
Then, step by step we have increased considerably the functions of our
program.
Thanks to Amiga's hardware and software systems, particularly suitable for
videos, VideoFX allows obtaining much more than animation players. As a
matter of fact, any Amiga machine is equipped with four audio-stereo
channels and can execute more than one program at the same time, by
integrating them by means of AREXX.
<P>
The fruit of our ideas and hard work is VideoFX: a program that allows
controlling and managing video productions automatically and in a
integrated way. Besides, VideoFX's potentialities are not restricted to
video productions.
VideoFX can be used for many more purposes, which you will understand after
reading this manual.
<P>
<B>The concept of VideoFX</B>
<P>
VideoFX is based on the simple concept of event-&#62;effect. The event is
something that happens; the effect is what happens (what is performed by
the machine) as a consequence of the event. To give an example: if you
press the light button (event) the light will go on (effect). The
management of VideoFX's events and effects is very complete and allows
creating complex associations between events and effects: an event may
cause several effects, and an effect may be caused by several events. Going
on with the example of the light switch, we can say that it is possible to
create a lighting system with two light switches and three bulbs, so that
the first switch switches on all the three bulbs, while the second one
switches on only one bulb.

<B>Technical Features</B>
<P>
VideoFX is compatible with AmigaOS 2.1. (KickStart v37.175+, Workbench
v38.xx) or the following ones. It requires at least 2Mb of Fast Ram and a
Hard Disk.
Obviously, the more memory, fast processors and AGA chipsets are used the
better will be the resuls obtained from VideoFX. As most programs for
Amiga, VideoFX does not require any particular processor. VideoFX can be
used with AmigaOS 2.1 developed in 1991.
<P>
Note that Amiga allows his users to choose the configuration more suitable
to his requirements in spite of the actual international trend to create
products to induce users to buy other products.
<P>
The events manageable by VideoFX:

format to create effects with synchronized audio and video.
