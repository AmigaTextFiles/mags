UltraAccounts is one of the leading home accounts packages for
the Amiga, with a powerful but easy-to-use user interface that has
been specially designed to be suitable for beginners as well as
experts. It contains all the features you need, and none you don't
need - and is all presented from a GUI which is so easy to set up
and use that even people with no experience of computers or
accounts will be able to get it up and running in no time.
