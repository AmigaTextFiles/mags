<B>&#171;BRIEF DESCRIPTION</B><P>
Wordworth  is  a WYSIWYG wordprocessor.  This review is about
version 6. There  have  been  many  previous  versions,  I  bought version
2 in 1993, but I haven't seen any of the intermediate versions.<P><BR>

<B>INSTALLATION</B><P>
The  installation  procedure  uses  the  Commodore  Installer.
The  CD contains two versions of the program:  a German and an English one.
I installed the  English  version by opening the appropriate drawer and
clicking the install icon. The installer asked me if I wanted to install
the simple font library that doesn't support the PostScript and Truetype
fonts.  I shouldn't have said yes, because  I  missed  out  on the "complex
font library" that way.  I got it right the third time...<P>
On  the 1200 I didn't have any trouble, except that I had to make
an lha file  of  the  CD  and transfer it to my other computer, where I
unpacked it and used the install script.  I don't know if it's alright to
install the program on two  machines,  but  I  promise not to use it on
both machines at the same time. :-)<P>
On  the  3000  the installer found some old libraries
(diskfont.library, post.library) that it graciously replaced.<P>
The  online  help mentions running from floppy, but I think you
need the distribution on disk for that.  It's not possible to run the
program from CD.<P><BR>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B><P>
Of  course  Wordworth lets you edit text like any other
wordprocessor or text  editor.   No need to get into that any further,
except to say that you can use  keyboard  commands  for  most  functions,
which  I feel is important for a wordprocessor to do:  I don't want to take
my hands off the keyboard to grab for the mouse every few words.<P>
Wordworth  uses the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)
principle, so the  screen  is  a  more  or less exact copy of what your
printout will be.  The program  offers  a  lot of ways to change the
appearance of the text.  There are the obvious ones such as indentation,
justification, super- and subscript, bold, italics  and  underlined,  but
also  color, spacing, small caps, width and font (type  face).  All major
types of fonts are supported:  Compugraphic, PostScript and Truetype
outline fonts as well as Amiga bitmap fonts.<P><BR>
<B>USER INTERFACE</B><P>
Most  aspects of the user interface are configureable.  "Out of the
box" Wordworth  starts  with rulers at the top and to the left, a toolbar
to the left and  another  row of icons for various text formatting options
at the top of the window.   On the bottom there is a status line and a
scrollbar, and on the right just  a scrollbar.  Style sheets and drawing
tools can be displayed in their own window.  Fortunately, everything except
for the scrollbars can be turned off.  I didn't  find  the  toolbar very
useful at first, because I didn't understand the icons.   Then I discovered
that it can be put at the top of the window (in order to  have  more  room
side  to  side  for  text) and the icons can be completely customized.
This  was also when I noticed the "copy format" and "paste format"
functions  haven't  disappeared from Wordworth.  But they're only available
from the  toolbar.   These  functions  are  very  important:   when  you
mess up the formatting  of  a  paragraph  it's  nearly impossible to get
things right again, without copying and pasting the format of another
paragraph.  There is no longer a  "print  preview" function, but the text
on the screen can be zoomed in or out in  order  to  see  something up
close or to see one or more complete pages at a time.<P><BR>
<B>STYLE SHEETS</B><P>
I just love the style sheets!  This is how it works:  when you're
making a  large document, such as a report, it's important that everything
is formatted in  a  consistent  way:  the headings, chapters and so on all
alike.  With style sheets  you  can  define  characteristics for different
kinds of text, headings, notes  and  everything  else.   Then all you have
to do is tell the program what style a certain portion of text is and it
will be formatted the appropriate way. But that's not where it ends:  if
you for instance change the font for a certain style, everything that's in
that style will be changed.<P><BR>
<B>FILE FORMATS</B><P>
Of  course  Wordworth  can  read  a  number  of text formats:  Rich
Text Format,  Wordperfect  and  Word  for  DOS (not for Windows!), Works
for Windows, Windows  Write,  Final Copy II and Final Writer, ASCII, older
Wordworth formats. And  don't  worry,  it  will  read  your 15 year old
Wordstar documents as well. Saving  is  limited to Wordworth, Wordworth 3,
Rich Text Format, Wordperfect 5.1 and  ASCII.   Don't  expect  too  much
formatting to survive the different file formats.  It's also possible to
read TurboCalc spreadsheets as tables.<P><BR>
<B>IMAGES</B><P>
As  expected  from a state of the art wordprocessor, images can be
added to  the text.  A wide range of graphics formats are supported, such
as IFF, GIF, BMP,  PCX,  TIFF, IMG (bitmap), CGM and GEM (vector) and
encapsulated PostScript (EPS).   IFF  24  bit  color pictures are converted
to 256 colors.  I don't know about  other  true  color  formats.
Surprisingly,  it's  possible to print EPS pictures  to  non-PostScript
printers.   They  look  just as good too, only the dithering  is  slightly
different.  Pictures can be made watermarks, so you can type text over
them.  The text will appear "on top" of the image that way.  It's also
possible  to  add  a  variety of other objects to the text:  lines, boxes,
circles,  polygons  and  freely  drawn  lines.   To  Wordworth those, as
well as pictures,  text  effects,  textboxes  and  tables, are all
"objects" so they get treated  more or less the same.  The text-effects are
objects that contain a few words  of text that is transformed in some way:
turned into a circle or spiral, changing the color and so on.<P><BR>
<B>PRINTING</B><P>
All  types of fonts and graphics can be printed on any graphical
printer for  which  a Workbench driver exists.  Alternatively, you may use
the printer's internal  fonts.   It's not possible to mix printer fonts
with other types.  The reason  for  this limitation is that Wordworth is
unable to change from textmode to graphical mode in the middle of a page.
That's also why it's not possible to print  images  when  using printer
fonts.  Wordworth will also print directly to PostScript  printers,  but
only using PostScript fonts.  (Be it internal to the printer  or  on
disk.) Be sure to install every printer you intend to use using the
Wordworth  installation  procedure, otherwise screen representations of the
printer  fonts  aren't  available.   On HP Laserjet (or compatible)
printers the Compugraphic fonts can be downloaded for speedier printing of
pages that contain only  plain  text.   Wordworth  supports  color
printing, but due to lack of an appropriate  printer  I  was  unable  to
test  this.  Color images and text are dithered to different shades of grey
when grey scale printing is selected.<P><BR>
<B>SPELLING AND THESAURUS</B><P>
I'm not very impressed by the spelling checker's dictionary.  It
doesn't know  words  like  Amiga,  FAX, ethernet and wordprocessor.  The
dictionary uses British  spelling:   "theatre",  "centre"  and  "colour"
are ok, it doesn't know "theater", "center" or "color".  It's possible to
expand the dictionary with new words,  though.   There  is also an
autocorrect feature, but it uses a different (much  shorter)  dictionary
than the spelling checker.  It's useful as kind of a macro-expander,
though.  I found the thesaurus to be very useful (advantageous, effective,
fruitful,   helpful,  practical,  profitable,  salutary,  valuable,
worthwhile).   And  yes,  the hyphenation is Wordworth's.  (When I exported
this text to ASCII al the hyphens got lost...  I put new ones in by hand
but I'm sure I missed a few.)<P><BR>
<B>MACROS</B><P>
Nearly  every  function  that  has a menu item can also be used in
ARexx scripts.   There  are also "wizards" that perform functions such as
giving tips, creating  memos,  faxes, invoices and play hangman...  Wizards
are actually just ARexx  scripts,  I didn't see the exact difference
explained anywhere, but ARexx macros are in the Tools menu and wizards are
in the Help menu.<P><BR>
<B>DOCUMENTATION</B><P>
The online help is great, it answered most of my questions.  Online
help is  available  for  every menu item by using the right mouse button to
highlight the  item  and  then  press  the  "help" button.  The online help
is better than anything  else  I've  ever seen.  However, the manual on the
CD isn't very good. First  of  all,  it describes an older version.
Second, it's plain, unformatted text,  which makes for hard reading.  I
would have expected a Wordworth version! Of  course  that  way the details
of the installation procedure would be hard to get at before installing the
program, but it's not like there isn't any room for two  versions  on  the
CD...  But the worst thing is that the manual just isn't complete.   It's
a  far  cry  from the excellent Wordworth book I received with version  2.
But  the book is available separately for another five pounds so I guess
that's my fault for being cheap.<P><BR>
<B>LIKES</B><P>
I  like  the  output!   You  can  use  a  wide  variety of fonts in
your documents  and  print  them  on  any  printer, at the maximum
resolution of that printer.  I also like the fact that I can do anything
someone can do in Word for Windows  or Wordperfect on my Amiga, be it with
more effort.  It's great to have style sheets and foot- and endnotes at
your disposal.<P><BR>
<B>DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS</B><P>
Printing  in "normal" mode is slow, even on my 50 MHz 68060 CPU it
takes more than a minute to print a 300 dpi text-only page.  On my 3000 (25
MHz 68030) it only takes a few seconds more.  The toolbar can be
incomprehensible at times, help  bubbles  would  help  a lot.  The tabs are
very hard to handle.  Automatic chapter/paragraph  numbering  would be
great.  There is no support for different paper  trays  on  laserprinters,
but  I  guess  that's  because  the  Workbench printerdrivers don't support
this either.<P>
It's  a shame Digita didn't change the way in which printing is
handled. On  non-PostScript  printers  you  have  to choose between
printing fast with no graphics  or  slow with graphics:  it's not possible
to combine printer fonts or downloaded  Compugraphic  fonts  with graphics.
On PostScript printers it's not possible to use Compugraphic and Truetype
fonts.<P>
On  the  Digita website it says "including 50 Compugraphic fonts".
That sounds  good but it isn't.  Almost all of the fonts are ugly and/or
unusable.  I have  seen  some  of  them  before in freeware/shareware font
compilations.  The Shannon  Book  font  is  the  only one I kept.
Fortunately, I still have my old Wordworth  2  Compugraphic  fonts,  which
are excellent.  I don't understand why Digita  didn't  include those with
Wordworth 6.  But I guess a lack of fonts can be  remedied  by  "borrowing"
some  Truetype  fonts  from a neighbourly Windows user...<P><BR>
<B>COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS</B><P>
As  a  result  of  a  job  I  had five years ago, I'm very familiar
with Wordperfect  and  Word  for  Windows  on  MSDOS/Windows  machines.
So how does Wordworth  6 compare?  Pretty well.  Word for Windows is a lot
easier to use and complex  things  such  as  editing tables are much easier
to do.  But in the end it's  the result on paper that counts, and in that
department Wordworth can hold it's own.<P><BR>
<B>BUGS</B><P>
At  first  I  couldn't  get  EPS  pictures to work on the screen
and the printer  in  Laserjet mode.  This was on the 1200, on which I had a
beta version of the post.library and the PostScript datatype installed.  On
the 3000 I had no trouble.   Replacing version 23.1 of the post.library
with version 17.7 made all the  difference,  but  now  the  PostScript
datatype doesn't work anymore.  This immediately  led  to the discovery of
another bug.  Wordworth allows the text to flow  "around"  the  pictures,
following the edges of the picture itself rather than the edges of the
"box" the picture is in.  But when printing in normal mode (using the
Workbench printerdrivers in graphical mode) the picture box pre-empts
the  text,  so there is sort of a white box around the picture where the
text is overwritten.   The  workaround  is to make the EPS pictures
watermarks, then the problem  disappears.   A very strange bug is one where
I imported a file in Rich Text  Format  with  a  file name consisting of
numbers, a dot and a dash.  I was subsequently  unable  to close the window
or quit Wordworth, but other than that the program kept working fine.<P><BR>
<B>VENDOR SUPPORT</B><P>
I emailed Digita to ask where I could order Wordworth 6.  They told
me I could  order  it directly from them, so that's what I did.  After
sending in the registration card you are entitled to phone and written
support for a month.<P><BR>
<B>WARRANTY</B><P>
No warranty, apart from 30 days on the distribution media.<P><BR>
<B>CONCLUSIONS</B><P>
Despite  the length of the "dislikes" section, I like Wordworth.  I
feel it  offers excellent value for money.  But it's not perfect:  Digita
should take the time to fix the bugs and quirks and improve the speed.<P><BR>
