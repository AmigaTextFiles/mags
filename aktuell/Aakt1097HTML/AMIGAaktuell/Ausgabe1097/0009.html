<B>INSTALLATION</B><P>
The modem is simple to install.  Just take it out of the box and
using the supplied 25 pin modem cable, connect it to your Amiga's
serial port.<P>
If you buy the PC version, then there is nothing else to do as it
comes preconfigured with settings that work with an Amiga.<P>
If you buy the MAC version, you may need to type a few AT commands
to change the default configuration settings in order to make it
compatible with an Amiga.  Read your user manual!<P><BR>
<B>REVIEW</B><P>
Well, what can I say?  This is another in a long line of Supra
(now Diamond Multimedia) modems that I have owned.  As with each
of it's predicessors, it has worked flawlessly and reliably for
the 12 months that I've owned it so far.<P>
The modem was originally only 28.8kbps, but I upgraded it to
33.6kbps.  The upgrade to 33.6kbps was easy as the modem contains
a Flash ROM.  I just downloaded the new Flash ROM code off of the
Supra web site and using Term, I transfered the new ROM code to
the modem's Flash ROM using x-modem.  Unfortunately, the modem
is not upgradeable to the new 56kbps protocols.<P>
My Internet Service Provider (ISP) only supports 28.8kbps dial-up
at the moment.  The modem reliably connects at 28.8kbps in the
receive direction and usually 24.0, 26.4 or 28.8kbps in the
transmit direction.  I haven't ever tried to connect to another
33.6kbps modem, so I do not know how well it would connect at that
speed.<P>
The few times I have sent faxes, it connected at 14.4kbps, so I
was very happy with that.<P>
The modem comes with a bunch of fax &amp; communications software for
Windows95/NT (PC package).  Of course this is all useless on an
Amiga.  Instead, I happily use Term and GP-Fax.<P>
<P>
I originally bought the modem for the voice support. What I've
found is that there is only one software package for Amiga for
voice mail called AVM. I was unable to get this package to work
with the modem. To be fair though, I did not really put much effort
into it. I fiddled with it for a couple hours and then just gave
up. So, if anyone has it working, feel free to e-mail me and let me
know how you got it to work.<P>
I do not have Caller ID, so I cannot comment on how well that
works. Nor have I tried the included headset as I have not been
able to find any Amiga software to use it with.<P><BR>
<B>DOCUMENTATION</B><P>
The modem comes with several user's manuals.  There is a detailed
reference manual, a getting started manual and user's manuals for
the included software.
Every time I have refered to the documentation I have been able to
find what I am looking for with one exception.  The exception is
information on the AT commands for voice support.  There isn't any
reference to these at all.  I checked Supra's website, and there
isn't any information on the voice commands there either.  However,
the modem uses the Rockwell chipset and Rockwell has information
on the chipset, including all supported AT commands, on their
website - <A HREF="http://www.rockwell.com">http://www.rockwell.com</A>.<P><BR>
<B>LIKES</B><P>
I am very happy with the product overall.  As I mentioned above,
this is my 4th or 5th Supra modem going back to the 1200 baud days,
and they have all been extremely reliable and have performed at or
above my expectations.<P>
One thing that I especially like about this particular modem is the
LCD display.  It has a dual line LCD display which shows protocol,
transmit speed, receive speed, renegoatiating, etc.  It's a vast
improvement over the classic Supra 2 character LCD display on their
previous models.<P><BR>
<B>DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS</B><P>
My only dislike was that Supra did not provide technical reference
documentation on the voice commands.  But these can be easily
obtained from the Rockwell site (see documentation above).<P><BR>
<B>COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS</B><P>
I also currently own a SupraFAXmodem 33.6.  The difference between
the two modems is only the display and the SupraSonic has voice
support.  Otherwise, both modems perform equally well.<P>
I have used a variety of 28.8kbps modems via compatability testing
for my work.  These have ranged from Hayes, US Robotics, Multitech,
Motorola, etc.  The Supra modems have always performed very well in
comparison to the other brands.<P><BR>
<B>BUGS</B><P>
I personally have not found any bugs.  Supra has continously
updated it's website with the latest released (and Beta) ROM code
to fix bugs others have found.<P><BR>
<B>VENDOR SUPPORT</B><P>
I sent e-mail to Supra's tech support to inquire about the missing
documentation on the voice commands.  I received a response the
next day pointing me to Rockwell's web site where I could download
the chipset reference manual.  I was very pleased with the response
time and the content of the response.<P>
As mentioned above, Supra provides ROM updates on it's website.<P><BR>
<B>WARRANTY</B><P>
The warranty for this product is 5 years from the original retail
purchase date.<P><BR>
<B>CONCLUSIONS</B><P>
In conclusion, I am very happy with the modem.  It has been very
reliable and has performed above my expectations.  If you are
buying it for voice support, you might want to think twice as the
Amiga is lacking software in this area.<P>
I would give this product 5 out of 5 stars.<P><BR>
