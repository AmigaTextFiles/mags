<H2>3. QNX gibt nicht auf: Umsetzung f&uuml;r Phase5-PowerUp-Karten geplant</H2>
<P>
&raquo;QNX® and phase 5 Team Up to Provide Migration Path for AMIGA® Users
</P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</P>
<P>
Kanata, Canada and Oberursel, Germany - July 22, 1999 - QNX Software
Systems and phase 5 digital products have announced a licensing agreement
that allows phase 5 to port the QNX Neutrino OS to its current line of
PowerUPTM accelerators for Amiga computers.
</P>
<P>
Once the port is completed, the two companies will donate a runtime version
of the OS free of charge to the Amiga community. This version will run on
all current 603/604-based PowerUP boards.
</P>
<P>
&quot;By teaming up with the leading manufacturer of hardware upgrades for Amiga
computers, we're taking the next step in our growing commitment to the
Amiga community,&quot; said Dan Dodge, CTO at QNX Software Systems. &quot;More
importantly, Amiga developers will benefit in at least two ways. First,
they can use their existing Amiga computers to develop next-generation
multimedia applications based on the QNX Neutrino OS. QNX application
development will be completely self-hosted; no PCs required. Second, they
can run their legacy Amiga applications and new QNX applications
simultaneously, thanks to a powerful 68k emulator from phase 5, which will
provide Amiga OS 3.x support.&quot;
</P>
<P>
&quot;QNX provides all the software functionality - and more - to fulfill the
expectations of the many users who still believe in the original Amiga
vision: a vision of technical superiority, innovation, and just plain
fun,&quot; said Wolf Dietrich, general manager of phase 5 digital products. &quot;By
putting all these features, OS services, and tools straight into the hands
of Amiga developers, we expect that a large number of applications running
under QNX for PowerUP boards will be released quickly.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Phase 5 also has the option to license QNX for future standalone systems
based on next-generation PowerPC processors.
</P>
<P>
Availability
</P>
<P>
The QNX Neutrino OS for PowerUP boards, including applications, windowing
system, drivers, and Amiga 68k emulation system, will ship with the new
phase 5 Blizzard and Cyberstorm G3 accelerators, which are scheduled for
delivery in Fall 99.
