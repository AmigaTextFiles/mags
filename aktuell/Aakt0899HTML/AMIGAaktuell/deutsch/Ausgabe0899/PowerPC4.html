<H2>4. Phase 5 digital products k&uuml;ndigt neues Computersystem an</H2>
<P>
&raquo;phase 5 digital products announces the AMIRAGE TM K2,
the first model in a series of powerful next-generation computer systems
</P>
<P>
Oberursel, July 22, 1999: phase 5 digital products today proudly announces
a first product of a new series of multimedia computers, the new AMIRAGE
TM K2 multimedia computer which will provide breathtaking features and
functionality. This new system will finally realize a vision of computing
for the next millenium, which phase 5 digital products has shared with
many Amiga users and supporters of innovative concepts.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Based on our license agreement with QNX Software Systems Ltd., we are now
able to provide our customers with a powerful realtime OS with all the
necessary functionality - and much more - that can make a next-generation
multimedia computer fly&quot; says Wolf Dietrich, General Manager of phase 5
digital products. &quot;The lack of a decent OS, which can support our hardware
vision, has been the major reason that earlier projects for stand-alone
systems at phase 5 had been put on hold. That problem is solved by
integrating the QNX Neutrino OS, so we now can push forward our demanding
vision of a new powerful computer generation.&quot;
</P>
<P>
The new AMIRAGE TM K2 computer system supports full multi-processing and is
already in it's base configuration expandable with additional CPUs. More
than that, distributed processing through different networks is fully
supported, allowing the realization of a new vision of computing,
including distributed, internet-aware applications and services. The
AMIRAGE TM K2 computer will be an expandable power-horse for all kind of
creative computing and multimedia, with many upgrading options and
interfaces for third-party add-ons, and offer full compliance with the
major industry and digital multimedia standards.
</P>
<P>
As the new QNX Neutrino OS will also become available for all PowerUPTM
upgrades for Amiga computers developed by phase 5 digital products (please
read the respective announcement here), a smooth upgrade path and full
Amiga 3.x legacy support is provided both for end users and developers of
the existing PowerUP product line from phase 5 digital products. With this
stunning feature set, it is expected to see a large number of
next-generation applications, running natively under the QNX Neutrino OS
on the AMIRAGE TM K2 computer to be available with the release of the new
system, which is scheduled for the beginning of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
&quot;We are excited that we finally can create a product technology which we
could not realize in the past, due to the lack of OS support and a
competition with non-existing but announced projects, which we were faced
with&quot; outlines Wolf Dietrich. &quot;The new AMIRAGE TM K2 design extends the
proposed features of our older pre\box project, and contains many elements
of the earlier A\BOX concept, but without the neccessity to design
customized hardware right now. As the QNX Neutrino OS concept is also in
full accordance with our vision of a new OS - in the past and today - we
feel that we finally can make the dream of many Amiga users as well as
other computer users come true.&quot;
</P>
<P>
The AMIRAGE TM K2 computer system will be built around the latest available
technologies, and support the major standards in digital multimedia.

With it's extensive features and impressive multimedia functionalities, the
AMIRAGE TM K2 is a powerful personal workstation for all purposes. But
beyond that, it will also be the first fully-featured Personal
Network&amp;Media Server that will function as a heart of a new generation of
computing. &quot;AMIRAGE TM K2 is not designed to only impress with a potential
hardware overkill. We do hear a lot about new applications and even
revolutions in the computer industry these days. We at phase 5 digital
products also believe that computing will differ in the future, and new
services will be expected by the users&quot; comments Wolf Dietrich. &quot;But still
the necessary hardware functionality counts, to make such new services
available. If you e.g. want your multimedia and 3D data streams to appear
somewhere else than on your local monitor, than a typical 3D display card
that outputs a single high-frequency analog signal, which allows a maximum
of 1.5 meters shielded cable, is not very helpful. For such applications,
fully digital processing units - as provided with the AMIRAGE TM K2's
processor and coprocessor units - and networking capabilities are needed
to process the data and distribute it to any device or appliance that can
communicate with the user. The hardware of the AMIRAGE TM K2, as well as
the superior functionality of the QNX Neutrino OS, perfectly meet the
requirements of such demanding next-generation applications.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Consequently, in the 2nd quarter of 2000, phase 5 digital products will
release a first external extension, the AMIRAGE TM LCU, which is a Local
Communication Unit. This small and very inexpensive device will be used to
provide local video and audio output on separate monitors, TV sets, or
other video/audio devices. The audio and video streams are provided as
digital data streams (in different digital formats, depending on the
actual content, e.g. as MPEG Audio/Video or lossless compressed for the
display of digital screens) by the AMIRAGE TM K2. The AMIRAGE TM LCU also
accepts inputs via an IrDa interface, e.g. from remote controls or
keyboards, to allow full interaction. It is currently planned to connect
the LCU via the IEEE-1394 port. As multiple LCUs can be connected to the
AMIRAGE TM K2, it is possible to display video and output audio on various
devices, including the simultaneous output of different audio/video
streams; thus, it is e.g. possible that different persons in a house watch
a video, browse the internet, hold a videoconference, and play a 3D game
independently and simultaneously (or play an interactive game together,
for example). This is just a first example of what will be possible from
the synergy of the superior QNX Neutrino OS and the powerful AMIRAGE TM K2
hardware platform from phase 5 digital products. Also under consideration
are inexpensive and wireless webpads and hand-held communication devices
for videoconfering/videophoning, with lowest power consumption, which use
the AMIRAGE TM K2's communication functionalities and data processing and
distribution capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The new AMIRAGE TM K2 computer system is scheduled for shipment with the
beginning of the year 2000. The pricing of the base system is TBD and will
be determined later this year. More information will be published
regularly; please come back often and check for updates, mailings lists,
and other news.

&raquo;Preliminary information about the Amiga® OS 3.x legacy support
on the new BLIZZARD and CYBERSTORM G3 boards,
and the upcoming AMIRAGE TM K2 computer system
</P>
<P>
phase 5 digital products will provide full Amiga® OS 3.x legacy support
under the QNX Neutrino OS for PowerUPTM. The existing Amiga® OS 3.x (and
it's applications) will be running under a powerful 68k emulator, which
runs as a fully memory-protected application under the Neutrino kernel. A
new version of the PPC library will provide full compatibility with
existing PowerPC applications which make use of the message system of the
PPC library, and call threads under the QNX Neutrino OS to execute the
PowerPC code. Similarly, updated drivers for CyberGraphX and the CyberSCSI
device will directly call native GFX and SCSI drivers under the QNX
Neutrino OS, thus providing native PPC execution and increased stability
with full memory protection again. By this new software implementation,
the current PowerUPTM Accelerator boards will provide increased
performance and usability for many applications, and will also serve as
development systems for software developers writing applications for the
AMIRAGETM K2 next-generation multimedia computer systems by phase 5
digital products, which will be running the QNX Neutrino OS.
</P>
<P>
The new QNX Neutrino OS for PowerUPTM and next-generation multimedia
computer systems, including the Amiga® OS 3.x / 68k emulation system, will
be shipping with the new Blizzard and Cyberstorm G3 Accelerators, which are
scheduled for delivery by end of September 99. For all users of the
installed 603/604 based PowerUPTM boards, the complete software package
will be available for free via internet download, or on CD against a fee
covering handling and postage.
</P>
<P>
With an installed base of appx. 10,000 systems, the PowerUPTM accelerators
today represent a small, but very respectable starting base for all active
Amiga® developers to port and update their applications to the new QNX
Neutrino OS for PowerUPTM, and improve them with new functionality. With
the new next-generation multimedia computer systems, a rapidly growing
market for innovative software developers will emerge early in the year
2000. phase 5 digital products is strongly encouraging developers to port
applications to the new QNX Neutrino OS for PowerUPTM and next-generation
multimedia computer systems. A new developer contact at phase 5 digital
products will be installed by end of August 99.
