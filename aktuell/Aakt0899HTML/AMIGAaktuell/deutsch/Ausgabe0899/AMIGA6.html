<H2>6. AMIGA verwendet Linux als Kernel f&uuml;r die Betriebsumgebung des AmigaNG</H2>
<P>
&raquo;July 9, 1999 Amiga selects Linux as their Next Generation OS Kernel
</P>
<P>
July 9, 1999 - San Diego, California. Amiga has selected Linux as the OS
kernel for the new Amiga Operating Environment that is scheduled for
release later this year. Amiga is selecting Linux after several months of
evaluating the technical progress of the OS and the tremendous industry
support that Linux has gained.
</P>
<P>
The development community has given Linux a major endorsement and the
momentum that Linux now enjoys is having a significant impact on the
computer industry. There are a large number of hardware device drivers and
software applications written for Linux already and this number is growing
daily.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Our strategy for implementing the new Amiga is to integrate the best
technology in the industry into a new, efficient, exciting and
revolutionary computer platform focused on the future'' said Jim Collas,
President and CEO of Amiga. &quot;Using Linux as our OS kernel is only one
component of the overall Amiga Operating Environment.''
</P>
<P>
Look for more information on the choice of Linux as part of the overall
Amiga Operating Environment in the Executive Update section of our web
site.&laquo;
