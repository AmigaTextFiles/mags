<P>
David Curtis, Director of Object Technology and Transaction Services, is
responsible for the development of the Internet-based transactional
services that support Amiga's products. Prior to joining Amiga, Mr. Curtis
was Director of Enterprise Technology at Inprise, a leading supplier of
distributed object and transactional infrastructure technology.
</P>
<P>
Previously, David was Director of Platform Technology for the Object
Management Group, the leading international software consortium for
developing standards for distributed systems. Mr. Curtis managed the OMG
platform technology adoption process, providing architectural direction,
and leadership in building industry-wide consensus. Before joining the OMG,
Mr. Curtis was Vice President of Engineering and Chief Technology Officer
at Expersoft, an early leader in the field of distributed object
technology. He was the designer and architect for the Expersoft software
product line, which included the award-winning PowerBroker ORB product.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Curtis is the primary author of several key OMG standards for
distributed computing, including the IIOP protocol standard, the
specification for interworking between Microsoft's DCOM environment and the
CORBA environment. Most recently, he has authored the abstract component
model and implementation framework for CORBA Components, an emerging
standard for component-based server development. Mr. Curtis is the
co-author of &quot;Integrating CORBA and COM Applications&quot; (Wiley Computer
Publishing), and is currently working on a book describing the architecture
of the CORBA Component Model.&laquo;

</P>
<P>
Dr. Jim Miller, Director of User Experience R&amp;D, has worked in the field of
human-computer interaction for over 17 years. He has specialized in the
development of interactive systems that provide exceptional creative power
to their users, while maintaining exceptional ease of use. Prior to joining
Amiga, Jim was doing consulting on the design and evaluation of the user
interface components of desktop software and Internet products, and was
involved in startup activities in the area of consumer Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Jim was the program manager for Intelligent Systems at Apple's
Advanced Technology Group, where he led a number of research projects on
human-computer interaction and intelligent interfaces, especially those
involving agents and assistants, speech, and natural language processing.
Here, as elsewhere, much of his work was focused in supporting technology
transfer between research and product development teams. The result of one
such collaboration, Apple Data Detectors, is available at
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/applescript/data_detectors" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.apple.com/applescript/data_detectors</A>. Some of his other
interests include the ongoing convergence of computation and consumer
technologies, the creation of distributed networked communities, and the
evaluation methods for interactive systems.
</P>
<P>
Prior to joining Apple, Dr. Miller was the manager of the Human-Computer
Interaction Department in Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, and a project
leader in human-computer interaction at MCC (Microelectronics and Computer
Technology Corporation). Jim has a Ph.D. and an M.S. in Psychology from the
University of California, Los Angeles, and a B.S. in Social
Science-Computer Science from Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>
Jim is also active in SIGCHI, the ACM's special interest group for
human-computer interaction. He was co-chair of the 1992 CHI conference, and
was elected chair of SIGCHI in 1993. Currently, he sits on the SIGCHI
Executive Committee as Past Chair, and is also a member of the
organization's Conference Management Committee.&laquo;
