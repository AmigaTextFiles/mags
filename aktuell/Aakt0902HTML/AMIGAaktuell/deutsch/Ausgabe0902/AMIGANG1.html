<H2>1. Neues Executive Update von AMIGA-CEO Bill McEwen</H2>
<P><B>AMIGA, Inc. (<A HREF="http://www.amiga.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.amiga.com</A>) informiert:</B></P>

<P>
September 5, 2002 - From the desk of Bill McEwen
</P>
<P><B>Greetings to one and all:</B></P>
<P>
I would first like to thank all of those that I had the chance to meet in
Sacramento. While a short trip it was indeed great fun and real delight
meeting with all of you and hearing not only the encouraging words, but
also sharing in your concerns, desires, and dreams. We are looking forward
to deliver on what we discussed with you.
</P>
<P>
When we purchased Amiga from Gateway there were many out there who said
that we would fail. There were many out there who have worked against our
efforts, and others that have misrepresented fact and manipulated
privileged information in order to further their obviously self serving
goals. There have been those who have wronged us, and caused us damage.
</P>
<P>
But, guess what? We are still here! We are still delivering! We are going
to stay here! Amiga is about people, technology, excellence, we are a most
tenacious people, and we have the community to prove it. Has it always gone
according to plan? no. Have we made some adjustments to the plan? yes. Are
we delivering on the plan? yes. Will we allow others to dictate our future?
Absolutely not. Period..
</P>
<P>
Because of you, the Amiga dream lives, because of you, Amiga's are still
being used throughout the world performing amazing tasks and activities,
and because of you, we are still here and moving forward.
</P>
<P>
Amiga is a giant resting for the day of the fight, and gaining strength
quietly, for, as we embark on this mission together, nothing will tear us
apart.
</P>
<P>
Thank you once again for supporting us, and showing to the world that what
was begun in 1985 was truly only the beginning.
</P>
<P><B>Bill McEwen, and the Amiga Team</B></P>
<P><B>Amiga Club Members:</B></P>
<P>
I would also like to take a minute and say a special howdy to all of the
club members. It is really encouraging to see all of the activity and input
from you with regards to the shirt design and name for the club. The &quot;I am
Amiga&quot; name did not go over as well as I had thought, but in the next
couple of weeks (after we get the ok from those who already have the name
that was selected) we will all have the name and shirt design with which an
be happy and proud to wear. Each member will receive their first newsletter
in the next two weeks, and there will be all sorts of great announcements
and information e, so look forward to it in your inbox.
</P>
<P>
As a reminder we will be having a new drawing for an Amiga Enabled Cell
Phone in September, and we would encourage those of you who have not joined
yet, to get in here and do so. We have many plans and activities coming up
for the club, and once again for only $ 50.00 you will receive the
newsletter, Shirt and other special promotions. The lifetime membership
offer has ended, but we would encourage you to be a part of something
really exciting as the members will continue to receive special discounts
and exclusive programs directed at the membership. We will honor the
&quot;$50.00 off&quot; certificate for the next members who join through the end of
September, at which point we will hold the draw for the new cell phone.
</P>
<P><B>September 1st, 2002:</B></P>
<P>
As mentioned in Sacramento at AmiWest, we had offered amnesty to those
people/companies/entities who have knowingly stolen our IP and used it for
their own gains, or who have shipped product knowing that they are illegal
had until the end of August in order for them to comply and to get legal.
</P>
<P>
Now, I am not going to mention names nor am I going to get into a public
discourse on what is happening.. But legal action has begun. In the next
two weeks papers will be served. We will target one violator at a time with
the hope that we will send a very clear signal that this is very serious,
will not be permitted and will be stopped.
</P>
<P>
This is a private action between Amiga Inc, and those who wish to continue
in this practice. While we announced publicly our intentions, the actions
will be private. I am sure that everyone can understand this and I hope
will support this.
</P>
<P><B>AmigaOne Update:</B></P>
<P>
Well, the amazing team of Eyetech and Hyperion are doing a great job. Many
of you already have in your possession the AmigaOne boards, and many more
of you have seen the hardware in action. This is indeed another major leap
forward as we near the release of the new hardware and OS 4.0. Eyetech and
Alan Redhouse have been doing a great job of keeping everyone informed of
the progress, and we look forward to the products release.
</P>
<P><B>AmigaOS 4.0:</B></P>
<P>
Hyperion and the team are making amazing strides here. The screen shots
that we all see and the updates from Ben and the people working on it shows
great progress. I know that they are working hard with regard to the
integration into the AmigaOne, and I for one am looking forward to seeing
it all working together, and from what I hear we are not too far off from
making that happen. With this stated we have received some more shots of
the interface from the OS 4.0 team. You can see the new AmiDock screenshots
here.
</P>
<P><B>PDA/Cell Phone Update:</B></P>
<P>
As mentioned in Sacramento the Amiga Anywhere Content Engine and associated
content will be shipping on the new Sendo™ SmartPhone™ when it ships. Now,
to answer the many e-mails that I have received about the Sendo phone…. I
do not know when the device will ship commercially; it is out of our hands
with regard to when they will have the phone available. I will tell you
that before the end of the year we will be making at least two more Cell
Phone announcements and at least two more PDA announcements.
</P>
<P>
We are really starting to move on getting these business deals done and
there will be many more opportunities for our developers to create new
products for these cutting edge devices.

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">opportunity.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
This opportunity is for excellent laptop hardware at excellent prices. They
would be dual boot systems with Linux/UAE, and Bernie Meyers product
(formally known as Amithlon) pre-loaded on the device. Here is a sample of
some of the pricing that you could expect, all prices quoted are in US$:
</P>
<P>
Intel® 1.2GHz Celeron™ Processor, 256MB RAM, 15.0&quot; TFT Active Matrix, 20GB <BR>
Hard Drive, DVD Drive, Linux/UAE Ami* $999
</P>
<P>
Intel® 1.6GHz Pentium® 4 Processor, 256MB RAM, 15.0&quot; XGA TFT Active Matrix,<BR>
20GB Hard Drive, DVD/CDRW Combo Drive, Linux/UAE Ami* $1579
</P>
<P>
Intel® 1.6GHz Pentium® 4 Processor, 256MB RAM, SXGA TFT Active Matrix,<BR>
30GB Hard Drive, DVD/CDRW Combo Drive, Linux/UAE Ami* $1679
</P>
<P>
These examples are notebook computers. There are other options available,
but I am trying to find out how many of you would be interested in
purchasing these through your local Amiga dealer. Let us know by sending an
e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:interested@amiga.com.">interested@amiga.com.</A> There are also desktops and other
configurations but I think that a notebook Amiga would be compelling. Let
us know.
</P>
<P><B>The Product Formally Know as Amithlo*:</B></P>
<P>
As mentioned before Bernie Meyers has a wonderful product, and we expected
it to be out by now. However there have been a couple of delays, none of
these are engineering driven, that has delayed the release. I can tell you
that the new product will be out very soon, and will offer some new
requested features, and from what I understand is really going to knock
your socks off. We will have an update concerning the timing of this
release and the new name very shortly. So contrary to what you may have
heard, it will be available soon.
</P>
<P><B>Developers:</B></P>
<P>
This message is an update for you. You have created some of the greatest
content that the world has ever known. Your skill sets and your tenacity
have overwhelmed many, and everyday you become more and more important to
the future.
</P>
<P>
If you have been sitting on the sidelines I encourage you to jump in. We
are getting requests from many of our OEM partners with regard to content
that they are looking for on their devices.
</P>
<P>
While it has been a slow start (as is always the case in developing a
market), this next quarter is going to see major movement, and
distribution. We have many programs ready to take place for the Holiday
season and we want you to be a part of it. So I encourage you to jump in
make contact with us. Join us in creating the future.
</P>
<P>
In closing I wish to thank each and every member of the Amiga family for
their support and good wishes in this amazing journey that we have embarked
upon together. We are closer today than we were yesterday to the dreams and
goals of Amiga. Tomorrow we will be closer again, and soon we can all share
in the rewards.
</P>
<P><B>Sincerely,</B></P>
<P>
Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga Team&laquo;
