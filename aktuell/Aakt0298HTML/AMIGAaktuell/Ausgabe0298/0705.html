<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>AMIGA OS soll auf DEC Alpha portiert werden</H2>
HiQ, der Hersteller von Siamese, hat k&uuml;rzlich eine Information namens
"Project Alpha" herausgegeben.<BR>
Demnach soll bis voraussichtlich 1999 das komplette AMIGA OS auf die Alpha-
Prozessorreihe umgesetzt werden. Die einzelnen Schritte des Projekts:<P>
&#187; For Immediate release   8th January 1998<P>
HiQ is pleased to announce "Project Alpha" which is an ongoing project to
integrate the Amiga system with the Alpha processor. Already we are at
stage one, the Siamese RTG Software v2.5 which is Alpha and PC compatible.
Following on from this we are determined to see the AmigaOS ported fully to
this powerful chip over the coming 18 months whilst retaining backward
compatibility. For those who have not heard about the Siamese System please
check out our web site at www.siamese.co.uk<P><BR>
The "Project Alpha" plan of action is as follows.<P>
<B>Stage one.</B><BR>
Shipping Now!<BR>
Siamese RTG System v2.5 links existing Amigas via Ethernet to any Alpha
machine including the new range supplied by HiQ

<B>Stage two.</B><BR>
Shipping Q1 1998.<P>
Supplying Alphas to Amiga and Ex Amiga owning customers with one of the
following optional additions, or supplying existing Alpha users with these
products:-<P>
(a)  Adding the Siamese RTG System v2.5 and an Ethernet connection kit to
join the already owned Amiga and Alpha in a seamless link.<P>
(b)  Adding the "Access" Amiga units from Index Information ltd, which are
complete Amigas in a 5.25" drive bay, linked via internal Ethernet to the
Alpha/PC and giving the Digital Video based Alpha access to the Amigas
Analogue Video system to create a combined Analogue / Digital Video hybrid
system.<P>
(c)  Supply an additional Amiga Computer system for the US Video Toaster
market if not already owned, to create the ultimate NTSC Video and 3D
studio system with the accent on integration.<P>
(d)  Supply Amiga Forever as a free add on to encourage the ex Amiga owning
Alpha customer back to the Amiga once more. This will give the performance
of around a 50mhz 68030 based Amiga. Once they grow accustomed to the Amiga
way of doing things they can upgrade to Stage three.<P><BR>
<B>Stage Three</B><BR>
In final development, but taking advanced orders now.
Shipping in Q2-Q3.<P>
Designed around the "Inside Out" PCI based Amiga on a card from Index
Information ltd and the Siamese RTG v3.0 Software from HiQ Limited and Paul
Nolan, this System would create the ultimate Amiga and Alpha combined
Multi-OS machine on the planet and all "Powered By Amiga".<P>
Amiga Features include:-<P>
<UL>
<LI>Full Amiga 680x0 backward compatibility with AmigaOS v2.1+.
<LI>On board Amiga AGA chip set running up to 30% faster than existing chip
set.
<LI>Motorola 68040 or 68060 onboard  with speeds up to 75mhz, depending on
Chip used.
<LI>Amiga PCI card design gives access to PCI bus on PC/Alpha motherboard.
<LI>Supports all PCI, ISA and USB ports as well as standard ports.
<LI>Communication between Amiga processor and Alpha/PC chip and PCI boards
is at PCI bus speeds.
<LI>Amiga gets access to the latest high speed graphics cards and can use
the latest drivers.
<LI>Amiga gets full blown OpenGL 3D graphics.
<LI>Amiga gets Mpeg, AVI, Quicktime etc. Video.
<LI>Amiga has access to low cost, less than 200 in price, Digital video
Recording cards.
<LI>Amiga gets 16bit Sound and access to Wave Audio system at last via AHI.
<LI>The Amiga can run Macintosh software on high speed graphics cards.
<LI>The new Amiga Integrates seamlessly with the WindowsNT operating system
to create a robust and easy to use Amiga / Macintosh / Windows system.
<LI>Alpha speed available at up to 767mhz by Quarter two.
<LI>Alpha/PC gets an Amiga Video slot to run the Video Toaster direct from
the Alpha/PC.
<LI>Truly a Multi-OS and Multi Processor system for the first time.
<LI>680x0 based Macintosh users can get a huge performance increase and
migrate to NT.
<LI>This system is running NOW over Ethernet in stage 1, and this will be a
True "One Box Solution".<P><BR>
</UL>
<B>Stage 4</B><BR>
AmigaOS to Alpha Porting Plan.<BR>
Starts Q2<BR>
We aim to Launch the "Project Alpha" porting plans as soon as we ship stage
three, this is because it starts the entire ball rolling with the first
goal of creating an Alpha that is fully backward compatible with the Amiga.
Once the Amiga is ported it will leap frog any other Processor in one jump.<P>
Obviously the main advantage of this route is that the user has a machine
that can run Amiga, Windows, MSDos, and Macintosh software from one
incredibly powerful and economical system. This system is aimed at the
serious Amiga user and not the budget user today, however the Alpha is
coming down in price and once the porting is complete we expect to have a
base machine for around 1500 which is what an average PC costs today. This
is a realistic target unlike a lot of other so called new Amigas which will
not appear.<P>
Porting Time scale, (very approximate).<BR>
Starts from where Stage 3 finishes.<P><BR>
<B>Stage 5</B><BR>
At Q3-4<P>
Once this system is shipping, all Users who purchased the Alpha upgrade
path license package will receive their first upgrade. This will include
sections that can be removed from the Amiga OS control fairly easily and
handed over to the Alpha to speed them up. Graphics, Sound file handling
etc.<P>
Improvements to some functions like the maths functions and additions to
OS, to allow software to call Alpha Maths libraries etc. to speed up
floating point operations.<P><BR>
<B>Stage 6</B><BR>
At Q1-2 of 1999<P>
Once finished the entire OS will be Alpha based and only using the Amiga
Card for software that relies on the Amiga Custom Chip set, although
hopefully an ECS and AGA emulator may solve this problem. However we see
the Amiga chip set still being important for Amiga developers and that it
will be needed for some time to come with the Analogue Video world.<P>
All the best for the Future <BR>
