AMIGA Sponsorship at the Commenwealth Games 1998. A late report... but
facts!
</P>
<P>
From: Chiew Sin Kwang, Managing Director Innovations Lights &amp; Magic
</P>
<P>
AMIGA International, Inc. sponsored 32 bare AMIGA A1200 with 170Mb Hard
disk in the even to make AMIGA's presence in Malaysia and the rest of the
world more noticeable. The 32 units of AMIGA A1200 were used extensively
during the Commonwealth Games 98 in Kuala Lumpur (September 11, 1998 to
September 25, 1998) as information display system. Not only that the AMIGA
was used for information display to the public, it was also used to help
raise funds for the Malaysian AIDS Foundation project entitled &quot;the FRIDGE&quot;
and &quot;World AIDS Day&quot;.
</P>
<P>
10 AMIGA A1200s were fitted with accelerator card as some software requires
more than 2Mb of RAM to run. 12 units were used to display only static
advertisement in the public place such as the train stations and bus
stations where 2Mb RAM is only needed. 8 units were used to static
advertisement at several shopping complexes. 2 units were kept for
standby/replacement units.
</P>
<P>
We displayed game information to the public and 3rd party advertisements
using the 10 AMIGA A1200s which was fitted with the accelerator card. The
response from the advertisers were not good due to the early economy crisis
which were suppose to happened after the Commonwealth Games 98. The purpose
of the usage of AMIGA was to reach the public out of the game zone. The
AMIGA were equipped with modems and relative software to do the display the
information.
</P>
<P>
There was a 24 hours information broadcast centre set up in our office to
provide up to date information to the public. The entire project as only
manned by 3 people. It was rather a great challenge to us but we manage to
pull it through.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, we were using the AMIGA computers for some fund raising
projects and promotions to several corporate clients such as the Keretapi
Tanah Melayu Berhad a.k.a. KTMB (Malaysia's Only Railway Company). Ever
since the success of our project, we had been discussing the the KTMB for
almost 1 - 2 years in the implementation of the AMIGAs in the train
stations are Train Information System and Advertising too. The idea was
accepted and now we are waiting for their audio video sponsor to provide
all the necessary equipment and TV sets to be installed at the stations or
halts.
</P>
<P>
The AMIGAs will be installed with accelerator cards and modem to update
latest information. We will be conducting the full scale test run at 6
different location within a 100 km - 150 km radius. It the project is
successful, we will be looking at about more that 30-50 units installed at
other stations or halts.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the AMIGAs are used to do the trial run of the network
information system in our office.
</P>
<P>
Update after the sponsorship<BR>
From<BR>
Innovations Lights &amp; Magic (M) Sdn Bhd<BR>
</P>
<P>
We have been approached by a company which has the only license in Malaysia
to do data broadcasting via Radio Frequency (RF) after our success in
creating a information network during the Commonwealth Games 98. We were
asked to do Research and Development in using the AMIGA with their RDS
system to display information on the TV rather on the LED board. One of the
decoder was plugged into the AMIGA's serial port and immediately without
any drivers, the AMIGA can interpret the information coming in. By using
the Arexx and Scala Multimedia MM300 software we manage to overcome their
80 characters data broadcast limitation to an unlimited length of text
information. The AMIGA can be controlled to display certain information at
certain time by just a few simple commands on the PC. A radius of 100km was
tested and proved to be successful and the information transfer via RF
depends on the weather and location. Currently, the company is running into
some financial difficulties and the project is on hold.
</P>
<P>
We were also approach by a Electronic Bill Board manufacturer in Malaysia
to do animation and information display system which can play back on their
gigantic billboard using LED display. The AMIGA worked very well with their
gigantic billboard. The project was on hold due to some financial
difficulties faced in the company.
</P>
<P>
Our company was on hold from 1st November 1998 to 12th April 1999 due to my
unfortunate sickness. I was supposed to report to Petro about the update of
the AMIGA Sponsorship but I could not get the original report from the
Commonwealth Games 98 committee.
</P>
<P>
Business has been resumed on the 13th April 1999 and we hope to have AMIGA
International Inc continuous support to Innovations Lights &amp; Magic (M) Sdn
Bhd.

<P>
We apologize for the late reply.
