<P>
Seit einigen Wochen ist unter der URL <A HREF="http://www.amigaos.com" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.amigaos.com</A> eine Homepage
online, deren Betreiber nach eigenen Angaben ein Modell einer neuer
Betriebssystemumgebung entwickelt haben. Der folgende Artikel mit h&auml;ufig
gestellten Fragen l&auml;sst sich auf der Homepage abrufen:

&raquo;Introduction
</P>
<P>
Thank you all for your reactions! The last day's we received lot's of e-
mails of you, but most e-mails with the same questions. We were not able to
write all of you that's why we made this F.A.Q.
</P>
<P>
 Why are you doing this?
</P>
<UL>
<LI> We want to share our knowledge and we want to show the community our
   designs of OS environments.
</LI>
<LI> We want to present our ideas to Amiga Inc. this way.
</LI>
<LI> We want this project to be INTERACTIVE (interaction between USERS and
   AmigaOS.com).
</LI>
<LI> We want users of the Amiga community to help on designing an NG AmigaOS
   and we made the first step.
</LI>
<LI> Our faith in Amiga Inc. is very small, that's why we made our desings
   public.
</LI>
</UL>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Is there a link between Amiga Inc. and AmigaOS.com?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<UL>
<LI> NO, there is no link between Amiga Inc. and AmigaOS.com. We are
   completely independant. We actually like to give some advise Amiga Inc.
</LI>
</UL>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Is this OS running?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<UL>
<LI> NO, it's a functional design, we wanted to advise Amiga Inc. (designing
   user interface UI). An Interface shouldn't only be made by technical
   programmers. (The vision of a programmer is often different to that of
   the users)
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
 Why are you using a thing like the taskbar?
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Actually Paul designed a taskbar for Amiga already in 1992 (Paul: of
   course i can't prove it).
<P>
   The reason for that is that in a desktop environment it's confusing
   using ICONS when you minimize a window. The most logical step is a
   taskbar (of course all the features are optional).
</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
 Why is the dragbar removed from the desktop?
</P>
<UL>
<LI> In VGA resolutions it is technically not possible to have x different
   screens open in different resolutions and pull them down in front of
   eachother! This is only possible when all resolutions are of the same
   size and depth. That the base Amiga's have a feature like the dragbar on
   a screen is that in PAL resolutions it is possible to mix
   Hires/Lowres/Medres screens, but today's modern desktops are not PAL!
   But of course the 'Navigation-bar' is optional, the meaning of the
   desktop is that it is very flexible and user configurable.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
 Should MUI be integrated into the system?
</P>
<UL>
<LI> That's a decision Amiga Inc. should make. But software like MUI should
   not be made by third party software developers but by the maker of the
   OS. The standard interface of an NG AmigaOS should be much better than
   MUI. The interface is a part of the OS and sould not be made by third
   party developers. The interface is even as important as the technical
   part of the OS. The UI is meant to be the human-machine interface and so
   it has to be good!
</LI>
</UL>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">It looks like you only designed screenshots!&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<UL>
<LI> NO, we also covered the technical aspect. But for the users it's more
   interesting to see some visuals first.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
 What do you think of QNX?
</P>
<UL>
<LI> This is the most logical step for Amiga Inc. to do. To have QNX as
   partner will not say the Amiga is saved! The rest depends on Amiga
   Inc./Gateway. But if Amiga will go multiplatform (MIPS, PPC, Intel) it
   was a good choice.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
 What CPU will be used in a NG AmigaOS (AmigaOS 5.0)?
</P>
<UL>
<LI> That's a thing Amiga Inc. should decide. QNX is ready for multiplatform
   (MIPS, PPC, Intel). Our oppinion is PPC and Intel first. PPC for the
   Amiga PowerPC users and Intel for it's a very huge market (like Be
   does). But we still have the &quot;SUPERCHIP&quot;... ?
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
 Why are all contact emails Dutch, and always different?
</P>
<UL>
<LI> We are all Dutch Guys, and everyone is responsible for another section.
</LI>
</UL>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Is Wine being ported to Amiga?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<UL>
<LI> As far as we know not yet. Wine is an open project (totally free),
   sourcecodes can be found on the Wine website: www.winehq.com. But Wine
   is not our case.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
 What are your future plans?
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Work out the concept:
<P>
   &raquo; Inventarisation of UI objects (classes)
   &raquo; Technical part of the OS
   &raquo; U.D.A. Framework
   &raquo; Multiprocessing theory
</P>
</LI>
<LI> Site will be interactive, a screenshot contest will be held.
</LI>
<LI> AmigaOS Classic (3.x) section, wich covers items how to update your
   Amiga with new functionalities and let it work like modern OSes
   (MAC/Win/Solaris/Linux/Be).
</LI>
<LI> Developers section.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
We hope that lot of questions are answerd now. If you still wan't to know
more about this project feel free and email us: <A HREF="mailto:info@AmigaOS.com">info@AmigaOS.com</A>
