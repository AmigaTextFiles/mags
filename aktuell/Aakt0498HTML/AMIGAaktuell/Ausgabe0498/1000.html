<H3>1. Ank&uuml;ndigung: ImageFX v3.0</H3>
<P>
»Nova Design Now Shipping ImageFX 3.0
<P>
Contact: Kermit Woodall
Nova Design, Inc.
<A HREF="http://www.novadesign.com/">http://www.novadesign.com/</A>
<P>
For Immediate Release Nova Design, Inc., producers of the award winning
ImageFX package and the highly received Aladdin 4D package, are proud to
announce that the exciting version 3.0 upgrade to ImageFX is now shipping!
ImageFX has been the required graphics application for all Amiga owners and
has been a part of Video Toaster/Flyer owner's toolkits for years.
Combining painting, image file format conversion, image processing, and
special effects, ImageFX is the undisputed leader in graphics manipulation
on the Amiga.
<P>
"ImageFX 3.0 can be called the 'Users Request' upgrade as it is built upon
the input of our users.", says Bob Fisher, Vice-President in charge of
sales at Nova Design, Inc. "We've made wonderful changes to the interface,
adding instant asynchronous redrawing of your images, larger previews that
can be magnified, multiple image windows, real image layers, and many more
special effects!"
<P>
<B>Highlights of ImageFX 3.0</B>
<P>
The interface still follows professional standards for the Amiga and the
video and film industry with its paintbox style approach.  This has been
built on in ImageFX 3.0 to allow child menus to remain open for quick
access to frequently used functions, larger effects previews that you can
zoom in and out of and move around in, font sensitivity, multiple image
windows including the ability to open multiple windows for the same image,
real image layers that allow you to compose complex composited images that
can be modified over and over with ease, and many other improvements
throughout.
<P>
Cross platform connectivity has been a top concern with ImageFX, from its
Video Toaster/Flyer support, to its wide range of image file format support
for all computer platform image formats.  With this new release ImageFX
improves its Flyer support and also now gains support for the Photoshop
native file format so that layered images can be shared from Photoshop to
ImageFX.  ImageFX also now directly supports loading, and preserving,
color-mapped (CMAP) image data for quick, accurate, conversion of these
formats.
<P>
Optimizations are also included now for all processor types including the
68040 and 68060 chipsets.
<P>
Special effects have always been one of the touchstones of the power of
ImageFX.  From the earliest days ImageFX pioneered bringing high-end
"Hollywood-style" special effects to the desktop with it's morphing and
warping, wire removal, lightning and fire effects.  The effects in this
release extend this even further!
<P>
The all-new Clouds module allows you to generate true fractal clouds that
can animate their movement and evolve over time, via batch processing, from
one form to another.  The clouds can be layered to create three-dimensional
effects and combine with custom, or supplied, palettes to create wild
plasma designs as well.
<P>
Scatter is an amazing new effect that can shatter an image into pieces as
small as a single pixel and blast them apart in many different patterns.
This can be used for artistic designs or for dramatic transitions.
<P>
Also new in ImageFX 3.0 is Splash.  Splash uses ray tracing and bump
mapping to create liquid simulations of rain, water ski surf, gelatinous
wiggles and more. The effect can be batched to animate puddles of rainwater
and create highly organic transitions.
<P>
A classic effect from other computer platforms, Pagecurler, has been added
as well.  This can add a cool curled page effect to the edge of an image or
make letters appear to peel off of the page!
<P>
The true gem in the new effects is called FXForge.  FXForge uses simple
mathematical expressions that, when applied against each pixel in the
image, can create hundreds upon hundreds of new effects.  It uses a
superset of the same technology used in Adobe&auml; Photoshop&auml;' s Filter
Factory&auml; plug-in and is completely compatible to formulas for effects
created for that package.  Due to the overwhelming popularity of these
formulas, you can find hundreds, if not thousands, of them available on the
Internet.  Experienced users can create these as well to extend their
toolkit of special effects on their own! Unique to ImageFX's FXForge is the
ability to animate the parameters and access ImageFX's swap buffer for
transitional effects as well!
<P>
