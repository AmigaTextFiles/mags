«Fakten<P>
FUSION supports Apple's virtual memory when using an Amiga that has an MMU
present (68030/68040/68060). The Macintosh MMU usage is so complex that
rather than patching the existing resources, Microcode Solutions wrote all
new routines, which also allows the 68060 to support virtual memory (which
is not possible on any real Macintosh).<P>
The virtual memory is system friendly, allowing the Amiga more CPU time
(which makes programmed I/O devices transfer data quicker).<P>
FUSION supports AHI! Microcode Solutions has been working to help test and
debug AHI, so that 16 bit audio could be used with the Macintosh emulation.
We have succeeded! Using AHI, it is possible that standard Amigas have
simulated 16 bit audio (14 bit actual with 16 bit simulation routines). The
results are incredible. For those of you who thought that 16 bit audio was
only twice as good as 8 bit audio, you're in for a surprise. The only down
side of using AHI is that the amount of overhead required by AHI takes
about 20% of the speed away from the emulation.We expect this to change
with future releases of AHI.<P>
Microcode Solutions is also working on supporting AHI's audio input
routines, as well as standard parallel port digitizers for Macintosh audio
input (note: this support will not be available in the first release of
FUSION, but will be available as a free upgrade).<P>
The most advanced feature of FUSION is its InterCommunications Port(sm).
There is a a virtual link between the Amiga and the Macintosh while the
emulation is running. This link allows any programmer to access any
function normally available only to Macintosh programmers.<P>
One of the built-in uses of the InterCommunications Port (ICP) is the
availability of ALL Macintosh volumes on the Amiga side. This includes
multi-volume partitions. The devices become AmigaDOS compatible, and no
additional handler or filesystem is required. So, it will be possible to
use your favorite file copying tool (DirectoryOpus is our particular
favorite) to copy, delete, rename, etc. files on any Macintosh partition,
and all from the Amiga side.<P>
Microcode Solutions will be providing to the public, a complete
programmer's package (assembly code only) that will detail the use of the
ICP. It will be possible to do some neat things using the ICP, such as
playing QuickTime movies on your Amiga's Workbench, using the Macintosh to
convert or play the data. Likewise, it would be possible to have an Adobe
PhotoShop(TM) plug-in available to an Amiga image processing program.<P>
The ICP can put the Macintosh emulation into suspend mode.In this mode, the
emulation is put to sleep until it is told to wake up.While in suspend
mode, the Amiga regains 100% of the CPU time normally used to run the
emulation. By simply pressing SHIFT-LEFT AMIGA-N or SHIFT-LEFT AMIGA-M, the
emulation is put into suspend mode. These key combinations will switch
Amiga screens to either Workbench (S-LA-N) or the next active screen
(S-LA-M). The emulation is awaken by any call to the ICP (such as file
transfers, command messages, etc.) or by switching screens to the emulation
and just activating the window (by clicking either mouse button).<P>
Sample programs (including source code) are provided for launching
Macintosh application from your Amiga Workbench. Now you can create icons
for your favorite Macintosh program and just double-click them to
automatically invoke them!<P>
The ICP is bi-directional, so programmers could write Macintosh based
programs that used Amiga library functions too. The possibilities of the
ICP are endless!<P>
Microcode Solutions spent a great deal of time working on video
performance. Our efforts have paid off in substantial performance gains
over any existing Macintosh emulation! When using a Zorro III Amiga video
board (PicassoIV, CV64, CV64/3D, PiccoloSD64, RetinaZ3, etc.), benchmark
programs (Speedometer, Snooper, MacBench, etc.) show video performance to
exceed ALL 68K based Macintoshes, and exceed nearly all PowerMac machines!<P>
While the emulation is running, there is a control window in place that
allows on the fly changes to the emulation. These include: ICP control
(mounting/dismounting Macintosh volumes for Amiga use &amp;file translation
setup), video driver control (QuickDraw acceleration &amp;refresh rate
control), device control (remounting of ejected volumes), CPU cache
control, emergency shutdown, and an automatic Mac-to-Front screen switch.
The control window can be iconified.<P><BR>
