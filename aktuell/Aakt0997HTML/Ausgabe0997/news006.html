<B>INSTALLATION</B><P>
The CyberSCSI Mk II (from hereon designated as the CyberSCSI- or
SCSI-module) is an additional module for any Cyberstorm Mk II CPU card.
The latter features a connector on which the SCSI-module is placed.  It is
simply impossible to connect the two in a wrong way (especially with a
68040-based Cyberstorm: the cooling fin on this CPU forms a large
blockage).  Of course, if you are not comfortable opening the computer by
yourself, have your dealer or a qualified engineer do the job for you.
However, no matter who's performing the installation, there are a few `ifs
and buts' which complicate the procedure.<P>
Amiga 3000(T) users are informed that their computer may not work reliably
with Zorro III DMA-capable hardware in their system; this affects the
CyberSCSI-module as well.  However, I have been informed that this problem
is solved by switching to the latest revisions of the Buster and Gayle (or
was it Gary?) custom chips.  Keep in mind that this is pure hear-say; so
please check thouroughly with your dealer or someone with a good knowledge
of the 3000-hardware.<P>
Additionally, some soldering on the mainboard of all 3000-models is always
required if you wish to install the SCSI-module: it requires a signal which
is not provided by the CPU slot of said computers.  Please note that this
is NOT necessary if you install the module in a 4000.<P>
Regardless of the type of Amiga, READ THE MANUAL FIRST.  The firmware of
your Cyberstorm MUST be updated BEFORE you install the SCSI-module.  The
manual explains how to do this quite elaborately, but also informs you that
the updating procedure may cripple your CPU-module beyond repair.  These
kind of warnings give me the creeps.  It really takes a mental push (read:
a few gulps of whisky or vodka) to start the updating procedure after
reading about the possible consequences.  No programs are available to
restore your Cyberstorm to its original state; instead, you are advised to
contact the support department.  And then what??  Good going, guys!<P>
Two remarks here.  By chance I spotted a question in the
comp.sys.amiga.hardware newsgroup about unsuccesful updates; after a week
there were still no responses.  I therefore conclude (with the necessary
precautions) that a failure is rare.  The second remark concerns the
manual: it says that a rainbow pattern should appear early in the
bootprocess to signify the Cyberstorm's presence; this did not occur with
my module (strange), despite the fact that the updating procedure completed
successfully (*relieved sigh*).<P>
The second problem you run into is the amount of space you have to position
all cables.  The SCSI-module itself is not equipped with termination
resistors; they are placed on a separate PCB which houses the external
SCSI-connector.  The two are connected with a short (but very broad
50-wire) ribbon cable which passes squarely over the Amiga's internal IDE
and floppy drive connectors.  The effect of this new cable is that you have
to reroute the ribbons of said connectors in a way which would have Houdini
think for a while.  And then you still have to connect the internal
SCSI-cable (with connectors for 2 SCSI-devices and the controller)...  In
one word: messy.  I strongly suggest you test everything before you close
up the Amiga while you still have easy access to all hardware.<P>
And just when you think you've got it all covered: updating the firmware,
setting the termination resistors and miscellaneous jumpers, connecting all
cables, and so on...  you come to the conclusion that the (large) power
cables of the devices in the upper front drive bay and lower rear drive bay
meet head-on before everything is in place...  This is without a doubt
strongly dependent on the type of equipment you are using, but since a
warned person counts for two...<P>
Strangely enough, the informative manual makes no mention what to do with
the connector for the activity LED.  Since I intended to remove all IDE
drives from my system, I simply used the system's LED.  However, I have
seen various documents on how to install a two-colour LED; check out the
Aminet for a copy.  Keep in mind this requires you to solder a small
circuit, so have a experienced or qualified person do this for you in case
you can't do this by yourself.<P>
The above process is clearly described in the manual, but it will take you
a lot longer to _do_ than to _read_ it.  Keep your cool and you'll do fine.
<P>
Last but not least, I wish to point out that SCSI-devices in general are
affected by the quality of your cables like no other equipment in your
computer.  A full explanantion goes beyond this review, but I recommend the
SCSI-FAQ (ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-group/comp.periphs.scsi/) for a
full explanation.  You may be interested to know that in a random sampling
of cables which were supposed to adhere to the SCSI-2 standard, only half
actually did.<P><BR>
<B>REVIEW</B><P>

<U>Hardware</U><P>
If you are not familiar with the SCSI-jargon, I recommend you read the
SCSI-FAQ of which I gave the address above.<P>
This piece of hardware equips your Amiga with an autobooting,
RDB-supporting SCSI-2 controller.  With this hardware, you can connect up
to 7 SCSI-devices to your Amiga.  This includes hard drives, CD-ROMs,
magneto-optical devices, scanners, tapestreamers, and so on.  If it has a
SCSI-interface, you can use it on the Amiga.  (Of course you need some
software as well, but there are no problems concerning the hardware.)
Needless to say, this expands the capabilities of your computer
considerably.<P>
The most important thing you have to care about are the termination
resistors.  Without these, the backbone cable remains `open' at some end,
leading to malfunctions.  Since it is easy to forget to place or remove a
resistor, phase 5 have equipped the SCSI-module with an automatic resistor.
This clever circuit finds out on its own whether it is the last piece of
equipment on the backbone and switches itself on if this is indeed the
case.  One exception exists, but this is clearly documented in the manual.
You can of course also switch the resistor to manual or simply to off.<P>
Since this resistor is located on a separate PCB and the controller insists
on being at the end of a cable if you are just using internal SCSI-devices,
it follows you always have to install this PCB -- and thus run into the
already mentiond cable routing problem.  (If the latter requirement was
dropped, you could make a device-controller-device connection, and have the
termination resistors reside on both devices, thus eliminating the need for
the second PCB.  Perhaps it is possible, but since the documentation does
not mention it, I decided not to try.)<P>
The main controller PCB has three extra jumpers which aid in setting up
your system.  You can extend the waiting period at startup (useful for old
SCSI-devices which are slow starters), put the controller into `slow cable
mode' (if you have very long cables), and have the controller automatically
operate any device using FastSCSI-2 mode.  Of course the device has to be
able to handle this.<P>
The external port is a SCSI-2 50-pins connector.  In other words, if you
are going to use equipment which uses the more common 25-pins or Centronics
50-pins connector, you will need an adaptor plug (which are not exactly
cheap).<P>
Finally, the hardware itself looks well made.  However, the design is still
something which makes me wonder if it could not have been done in a smarter
way.  All the equipment is now stuffed in a small amount of space, yet
there is a huge amount of room left above the rest of the CPU-module, over
the SIMM modules.<P><BR>

<U>Software</U><P>
All software is delivered on one disk bearing the name `SCSI Tool Disk'.
When you reach the point that you can start using the SCSI-devices, you
will aready have used it: it also contains the updating program.  It is
quite interesting to see that the disk contains directories for all
products by phase 5 which can be extended with a SCSI-module; this includes
hardware such as the Fastlane and the Blizzard 1230 Mk IV.  (The only
difference as far as I could tell were the icons' tooltypes.)<P>
After installing the software (which consists of a SCSI-bus control
program, a HDToolbox-like program, the AmiCDFS 2.38 filing system, an
audio-CD player, DynamiCache and lots of documentation) using the normal
Installer, you are in business.<P>
The SCSI-bus control program (UnitControl2) allows you to change various
low-level options of the SCSI-devices and the controller.  This includes
parameters like reselection, bus time outs, and probing of LUNs during
start-up.  It is especially useful if you are optimizing the performance of
your storage media.  The on-disk manual is quite clear about all options
and you should read it carefully.  This is because some gadgets carry
rather misleading names which might cause data loss if they are operated in
the wrong way.<P>
SCSIControl3 is phase 5's replacement for the HDToolbox program.  It works
in a similar way and gives you the same options, save for a few.  For
example, it lacks a verify option, which can present a problem if you end
up with a `disk not validated'-error.  For this reason and the fact that
the graphical display of your partitions leads to a better overview, I
still prefer Commodore's program.  There is enough room for improvement,
and I therefore hope that phase 5 will do so.  In practice it gets the job
of partitioning done without problems.  However, I did find an annoying
bug: in order to access the information about the partition itself (size,
location, type of filing system, etc.), you have to double-click on the
name of the partition.  However, this will not work if the 'Del Partition'
gadget is active.  You have to deactivate this one first.<P>
The AmiCDFS filing system allows you to access CD-ROMs.  It can handle
quite an amount of formats: ISO-9660, HFS, RockRidge, PhotoCD and CDDA are
present and accounted for.  Not only is it quite extensive, it is fast as
well.  AmiCDFS is a shareware program, and I was amazed to find out that
phase 5 don't give us the full version.  This makes phase 5 look a bit
stingy to me; especially in conjunction with the disclaimer that programs
may be withdrawn from the disk at any moment if the author of the program
wishes it so.<P>
Both AmiCDFS and the audio CD-player program (MCDPlayer 1.01) work as they
should.  However, since I have never used a CD-ROM in any computer until
now, I have no experience with other programs.  MCDPlayer is quite crude,
and I'm sure better alternatives are easily found.  (I happened to see a
picture of a rather nice one in the April or May issue of Amiga Computing,
but I forgot its name.)<P>
The documentation is quite interesting for programmers, since it contains
(amongst other things) a complete list of all SCSI-2 commands, the source
to a low-level SCSI-bus program (not UnitControl2, unfortunately :)) and
some tips on how to get MS-DOS partitions on your mass data storage
devices.<P><BR>
<U>Real World Experience</U><P>
Installing all hard- and software and copying my data from the old IDE
drives to the Fireball proved not be the quick easy task I had envisaged it
would be, but within two hours I could remove the IDE drives and start the
first SCSI-only boot.  With IDE drives attached, nothing out of the
ordinary happened; without them no problems whatsoever occurred as well.<P>
Well, _any_ problems is perhaps too grand a word.  One small, but _very_
useful utility decided to call it quits: undel by Martin Mares.  This
undelete program insists on using the standard scsi.device to perform its
magic.  And the CyberSCSI-module is operated with the cybscsi.device, so...
In general, if the program allows to choose your own .device and unit
number, you can use it without problems.  A small number of people may ask
whether you can use the CyberSCSI-module with NetBSD.  At the moment of
writing (April 1997) the best answer I can give is `maybe'.  A
developmental module exists for this controller, but from what I read, it
still works rather unreliably.  In my opinion, you are better off switching
to Linux/m68k (yes, Linux/m68k!), which _does_ support this controller.<P>
It is a trifle pointless to present DiskSpeed data here, since they are
highly dependent on the hardware employed.  However, I can say that a
fragmented hard disk is a sure speed killer :).  However, that's no problem
ReOrg can't handle.  I am a little concerned with the amount of CPU-time
the DMA-controller demands, though.  Or better put (since DMA takes no
CPU-time at all) the time required by the programs before the
DMA-controller can be put to work.  Unfortunately, this is mostly OS-stuff
and therefore cannot be changed easily.  On the other hand, at least the
module at least leaves some time free in comparison to the 4000's internal
IDE interface!<P>
Even under heavy multitasking loads with lots of different programs
fighting for control of the hard disk and the CD-ROM, the module performs
without a glitch.  No compatibility problems could be established
(admittedly, my list of tested devices is small).  All in all, I am very
pleased with the module.<P><BR>
<B>DOCUMENTATION</B><P>
The 42-page bilingual (German and English) A6-booklet provides detailed
information about your new toy.  The installation procedure is clearly
described and includes a few small photographs.  SCSI in general,
termination resistors, jumper settings and common errors are devoted a few
pages each.  Sometimes I read a section in German, because in my opinion
that still describes everything best, but I am convinced you will have
little trouble with the English text, despite numerous spelling errors.
As a special extra, a pin layouts of the SCSI-2 and Centronics 50-pins
connectors are given.<P><BR>
<B>LIKES</B><P>
Speed, reliability, the manual and good software.<P><BR>
<B>DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS</B><P>
Difficult installation (possibility of damaging the Cyberstorm, strange
location of the controller PCB, two-PCB design, cable rerouting problem)
and the shareware edition of the AmiCDFS filing system.<P>
I know that in order to keep the price of the Cyberstorm down, phase 5 have
decided to provide the SCSI-controller as a separately available option.
There is nothing wrong with such a design, but more thought should have
gone to the problem of installation.  I sincerely hope a Mk III will take
care of this.<P>
A registered version (or at least a discount) for the AmiCDFS filing system
should be included as a standard.<P>
The SCSIControl3 program (partitioning) can do with a more user-friendly
user interface and a verify option.  A selector for #?scsi.devices and a
RDB-backup option could make interesting additions.<P><BR>
<P><BR>
<B>COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS</B><P>
Since I don't have extensive experience with SCSI-2 controllers, and tests
in magazines were done with different setups (notably different hard
disks), I cannot present an objective opinion.  Sorry!<P><BR>
<B>BUGS</B><P>
Various typos in the manual, plus one small bug in the partitioning
program.<P><BR>
<B>VENDOR SUPPORT</B><P>
Phase 5 is not exactly fast when it comes to handling email.  I suggest you
phone or fax the company if you want a quick(-ish?) answer.<P><BR>
<B>WARRANTY</B><P>
phase 5 have devoted quite a lot of text to the issue of warranty.  I will
summarize the text in this document, but please refer to the original in
case this becomes a necessity.  I accept no responsibility when this
summary and the original text differ!<P>
You get a 6 month guarantee, during which phase 5 will replace or repair
your module free of cost if the card was broken due to material or
production faults.  Excluded are faults caused by `outside interference':
improper usage, unauthorized repair or modifications and addition of new
hardware and software.  This includes SCSI-devices, but upgrades of the
_system_ hard- and software as well!  AmiCDFS and the supplied other
programs form no exception.<P>
phase 5 takes no warranty what so ever about the applicability of the
CyberSCSI Mk II; the company also does not hold itself responsible in case
of data loss, even when it has been warned about the possibility in
advance.<P>
In case of problems you are instructed to turn to your dealer for
assistance first.  phase 5 will only accept returns when they have been
assigned a so-called RMA-number; this number is given to you when the
support department sees justifiable cause for you to return the module to
phase 5.<P><BR>
<B>CONCLUSIONS</B><P>
The moment you've all been waiting for.  The Note.  I Have Decided (c'mon,
allow a guy his moment of glory for once :)) on 4.5 out of 5.  The
installation is a bitch, and not without risk to other hardware, but once
everything is in place, the module performs as any piece of hardware
should: reliably and speedy.  The manual is clear and packed with useful
information.  A very good addition to any Cyberstorm Mk II.<P><BR>
