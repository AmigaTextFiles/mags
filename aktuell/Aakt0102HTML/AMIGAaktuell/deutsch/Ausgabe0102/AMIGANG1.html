<H2>1. AMIGA, Inc. erh&auml;lt Verwaltungsratsvorsitzenden (Chairman) [englisch]</H2>
<P>
Vorab zur Klarheit: Bei amerikanischen Unternehmen ist der &raquo;Chairman&laquo; der
Vorsitzende des &raquo;Board of Directors&laquo;, einer Art Verwaltungsrat, der von den
Unternehmensgesellschaftern gew&auml;hlt wird und die grundlegende
Firmenpolitik festlegt sowie die &raquo;Executive Officers&laquo;, die f&uuml;r das
Tagesgesch&auml;ft zust&auml;ndig sind, ernennt. Damit hat der Chairman - zumindest
formal - einen gr&ouml;&szlig;eren Einfluss als beispielsweise der CEO (Chief
Executive Officer) eines Unternehmens. Wie sich die Zusammenarbeit zwischen
Frank Wilde und Bill McEwen konkret gestaltet, wird sich in den n&auml;chsten
Monaten zeigen m&uuml;ssen.

``I had many choices on where I wanted to go next and where the best
opportunity for the future was. Bill McEwen and I had been speaking for
many months on business plans and other issues, and after meeting with the
team, and viewing the technology and their partners, there was no better
choice for me than joining Amiga&quot; said Frank Wilde, Chairman of Amiga, Inc.
&quot;The Amiga has an amazing past and is well known at Ravisent, but seeing
what I have seen of the technology, they have even a brighter future, and I
am pleased to be here&quot;.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Frank brings a level of expertise and knowledge that is second to none.
His level of excitement and dedication to Amiga, will be seen shortly as we
continue to build and release new products&quot; said Bill McEwen, President and
CEO of Amiga, Inc. &quot;I look forward to working with Frank, and the two of us
working with the community and our partners on building a very solid
future&quot;.
