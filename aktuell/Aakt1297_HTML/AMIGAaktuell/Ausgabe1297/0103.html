<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Hardwaretest: Diskettenlaufwerk LS-120 (von Gary Colville)</H2>
&#187;It's a sad fact that while high density floppy drives have long been
standard on PCs and Macs almost all Amiga owners still strugle on with
old double density drives. At some time or other, most Amigans will
have looked at ads for Amiga-adapted high density drives, thought
about buying one, then looked at the price and quickly dismissed the
idea. Emulation enthusiasts, who really need HD capability, are about
the only people who buy them.<P>
Recently, removable-storage drives like the Iomega Zip have become
popular. They won't read high density floppies but they will let you
swap data with the many PC and Mac users who own one, and they make
great backup devices too. The Zip, however, isn't without it's own
problems. Zip disks are fairly expensive and the IDE version of the
drive has gained a reputation for working erraticaly on the Amiga.<P>
Wouldn't it be great if there was a Zip-like removable drive that
could read HD floppy disks and worked okay with the Amiga's IDE port?<P>
Well, now there is. The new LS-120 is an enhanced high density 3.5"
floppy drive that uses the ATAPI bus system and is capable of storing
120Mb on a special disk or 1.44Mb on standard HD floppy disks. Amiga
drivers for the LS-120 come included with IdeFix '97, which you can
find on Aminet.<P>
It was the presence of these drivers that originaly got me thinking
about the LS-120. The few hands-on reviews of the drive that I could
find seemed mostly favourable so, cash in hand, I plodded off the the
local Wintel hardware emporium. Ten minutes and 89ukp later I
emerged clutching an OEM type LS-120 (the OEM package consists of the
LS-120 and a Dos/Windows driver disk. No manuals or cables or the
like).<P>
The LS-120 is most often described as a 'Superfloppy' and you can see
why when unpacking it for the first time. It looks exactly like any
cheap floppy drive, right down to the layout of the PCB. The only
visible difference is the 40-pin connector on the back and the little
triangle-and-globe LS-120 logo on the dust flap.<P>
Physical installation is quite easy; Just connect the IDE data cable
and set the Master/Slave jumpers. A word of warning here: My LS-120
came with the jumpers set to CS (Cable Select) and this can cause real
problems if it's not changed to MS (Master) or SL (Slave) before you
try installing the IdeFix drivers.<P>
IdeFix 97 contains specific LS-120 support, and it performs admirably.
Running the "MountLS120" program produces a pair of new AmigaOS
devices: DF4 for disks formatted using OFS/FFS and PC4 for MS-DOS
disks. Also included are a couple of utils for low-level formatting
120Mb disks. Don't use these unless you really have to, as formatting
can take upwards of 40 minutes to complete.<P>
The DF4 device provided by IdeFix treats the LS-120 like a huge floppy
disk (indeed, you can even access it via trackdisk.device as unit 4)
but you don't have to do it this way. The LS-120 can take a RDB and be
mounted via a normal DosDriver, just like any other IDE drive. If you
want to use an alternate filesystem like AFS, this is your only
option. RDPrep crashed every time I tried to use it to access the
LS-120, but HDToolBox coped without problems.<P>
So, what's it like in use? Popping a fresh 120Mb disk into the drive
produced about 10 seconds of grinding before an icon appeared on
workbench. LS-120 media comes formatted for MS-DOS. Re-formatting for
FFS takes a while, but presents no problems unless the disk's
write-protect tab is engaged. Unlike some other removable drives,
write-protection on the LS-120 is physical. Once that tab is opened
nothing can write to the disk.<P>
Copying a block of files to the drive showed it to be fast, but not
lightning quick. If feels much faster than my 4x CD-Rom even if the
benchmarks I've done suggest otherwise. Running a mixture of benchmark
programs on a blank 120Mb disk shows a transfer rate in the region of
350K/sec. The following figures were generated by DiskSpeed using a
blank 120Mb disk and 200 FS buffers. The Amiga used was a 33MHz 68040
based A1200T.<P>

Some tests using various filesystems and block sizes show the LS-120
is very sensitive to changes in either. Performance using FFS with
standard 512 byte blocks is nothing special, but increasing the block
size and/or switching to another filesystem (AFS or MSDOS) improves
things. Also, the LS-120 sometimes pauses for 5 or 6 secods to
re-calibrate itsself, so throughput in non-benchmark operations will
be a little lower than shown here.<P>
One of the main reasons I bought the 120 was it's ability to read
1.44Mb floppies (but not, sadly, 880k or 1.76Mb Amiga-style disks).
Popping a PC disk into the drive results in a few seconds of very
nasty grinding sounds (you get used to these after a while) and the
normal disk icon appearing on Workbench. The LS-120 has a very natty
CD-style motorised eject, so now it's possible to eject floppy disks
without having to grope around for the eject button. The front panel
eject button has a small poke-a-pin-in hole to facilitate manual
ejection of stuck disks.<P>
Although the drive is limited to 720K and 1.44Mb disks, and not 880k
or 1.76Mb, it's quite possible to format these using FFS or AFS rather
than the MS-DOS filesystem. It should also possible to use the LS-120
with Mac and PC emulators but in practice this is a rather hit and
miss affair. PCx and PC-Task refuse to see the LS-120. Shapeshifter
uses it perfectly in both floppy and 120Mb modes. I can't comment on
Fusion as I don't have access to it.<P>
When accessing floppies the LS-120 shows significant speed advantages
over the standard Amiga floppy:<P>
These results are from the LS-120, accessing a 1.44Mb disk:

Nothing about the LS-120 stands out as being amazingly wonderful, but
lots of little things combine to make it a great drive. It's use of
the cheap and common IDE interface, large 120Mb disks, and ability to
read 1.44Mb floppies all add up to a very nice package. The biggest
point in favour of the LS-120 has to be it's price. Amiga HD floppy
drives sell for about 60ukp here, so a combined HD floppy and 120 meg
removable drive for less than 90ukp is almost too good to be true.<P>
For some applications the LS-120 is a little slow, and I hope the
designers can reduce the 10 seconds needed to mount a 120Mb disk to
something a little shorter. It's quite noisey, too. The grinding and
clunking can be very noticible, particularly when mounting 1.44Mb and
720K disks. This isn't a problem for me as the PSU in my tower case
drowns most of the noise, but if you have a standard 1200 with a quiet
hard disk it could prove distracting.<P>
After almost two months use my main feeling about the LS-120 is that
it's a superb drive sold at a crazily low price. If you have any need
for a removable storage drive, put the LS-120 right at the top of your
list. If just need an HD floppy, give serious consideration to
spending a little extra and getting an LS-120.<P>
