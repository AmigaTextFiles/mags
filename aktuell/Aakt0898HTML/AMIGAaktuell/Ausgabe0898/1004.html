<H2>4. Falsche Keyfiles bedrohen Weiterentwicklung von MakeCD</H2>

<P>
Nachdem bereits im Mai jemand die Routine zur Erzeugung von Keyfiles f&#252;r
die kommerzielle Version 3.1b der CD-Brenner-Software MakeCD entschl&#252;sselt
und illegal Keys unter die Leute gebracht hat, wurde nun auch der
ver&#228;nderte Keyfile-Algorithmus von MakeCD 3.2 geknackt.
Aus welchen Motiven die Person auch handelt - ihre Taten haben dazu
gef&#252;hrt, dass die Weiterentwicklung des Programms offenbar ernsthaft
gef&#228;hrdet ist. Weitere Details sind dem folgenden "Hilferuf" von Angela
Schmidt zu entnehmen:

&#187;Hi,
<P>
I have some bad news for all legal MakeCD users:
<P>
Somebody has managed to crack the key generation routine of MakeCD. He
already did this in May for MakeCD 3.1b and distributed lots of
Keys for the commercial version of MakeCD. Then we completely exchanged
the commercial key for MakeCD 3.2, which made invalid all commercial
keys that we every created. Therefore, we sent out free new commercial
keys to those users, who have registered for the commercial version.
But soon after MakeCD 3.2 has been released, that guy sent out new
registration numbers for the new commercial key.
<P>
So everybody with contacts to the scene is now able to use MakeCD
without paying anything for it and we can't do anything against it.
In former times, when people just published their registration
numbers, we could lock these numbers and take legal steps against
them. But now, this is no longer possible.
<P>
During the last two months, we noticed a dramatical (about 50 %)
reduction of shareware registrations. The reason might be dropping
interest in MakeCD, but our web server statistic shows, that the
interest in the new version 3.2 a few days after releasing it is
even higher than the interest was in MakeCD 3.1b soon after releasing
it. So I don't believe that dropping interest is the main reason for
the reduction of our shareware registrations. I fear that many people
now don't consider to register anymore because they know that
somebody has build a generator for the registration numbers. So they
have no more reason to register. In former times, it was difficult
to get a key that works with recent versions of MakeCD.
<P>
But fact is that Patrick and I have some costs that we have to
cover. For example I am still studying and _nobody_ pays me for
the expenses (my home, medical insurance, food, computer equipement,
books, ...) that I have. I have to pay this from the MakeCD income,
and if that is not enough, I'll have to accept a "normal job" and
invest my time into that job. =&#62; No more spare time for the MakeCD
development.
<P>
Beside these expenses, we have to pay for CD writers, CD-Rs and
things like that, which is also quite expensive.
<P>
We now have only a few choices:
<P>
1) Don't change anything and accept that we have lost against the
crackers. But sooner or later this would probably lead into
dropping the MakeCD development.
<P>
2) Change the commercial key once again. This won't help because the
cracker immediately would spread new numbers as happened after
the release of V3.2 and lead into 1). Somebody tried to make me
calm down, telling me that crackers just want to proove that
they are _able_ to crack a program and that the other intention
is to allow the user to try a software before buying it. This
statement is WRONG because
<UL><LI>
   He already _prooved_ that he is able to crack MakeCD by
spreading numbers for MakeCD 3.1b. If his intention was
just to proove that he is a poor genial cracker, there
would not be a need to publish 3.2 codes.
</LI><LI>
   Everybody can try MakeCD before buying it by just using
the demo version.
That cracker asked the software pirates to buy the software if
they like it but that's just ridiculous - how many software
pirates would buy the software after he got it for free...? :-(
<P>
</LI></UL>
3) Completely change the registration process. This would require
completely new registration numbers for all persons. We could
send out the commercial numbers for free in the past, but such
a big change is very cost intensive and takes much time (which
my sister Katrin is not willing to spend for free, of course).
So we would have to request a update free from everybody who
want to use new versions. =&#62; The legal users would have to pay
for what the crackers did. :-( Also, programming new registration
routines is very time intensive and so we would have less time
for new features.
<P>
Don't get me wrong, we did not yet decide what we will do in future,
so please don't spread any rumours. However all of you should know
that the crackers might about to stop the development of another good
piece of Amiga software. Hurrah... :-( They are doing _large_ damage
to the Amiga market and sooner or later they'll get what they earn:
A dead computer with no more new software. :-(
<P>
BTW, especially the market for CD writer software is very difficult:
only a small number of Amiga users own a CD writer and there are
<I>three</I> main software packages on the market: BurnIt, MasterISO and
MakeCD. Each of these programs owns only a small part of the market.
And thanx to the crackers the market shrinks even more... :-(
