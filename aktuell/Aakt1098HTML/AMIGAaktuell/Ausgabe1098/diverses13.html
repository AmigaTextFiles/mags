<H2>13. Upgrade f&uuml;r Siamese-Software v2.1 angek&uuml;ndigt</H2>
<P>
&raquo;It has been brought to my attention recently that the original v2.1
software  would not connect over the serial port on about 10-15% of set
ups. This seems to a comm port or BIOS problem, made worse with our heavy
use of the DTR line. It works on the majority of machines, however we
obviously want it to work on all, hence this update notice.
</P><P>
Therefore we have now tracked down what we believe is the problem and it
seems to have cured the problem that people were having and we have two new
files. They are the PC server "sisys.exe" and "sisys.ini" files.Replacing
the existing versions with these appears to fix the connection problem, so
please advise your readers that they can email me for a replacement
archive.
</P><P>
Sorry it took so long but we could never duplicate this problem on any of
our machines.
</P><P>
Yours sincerely
