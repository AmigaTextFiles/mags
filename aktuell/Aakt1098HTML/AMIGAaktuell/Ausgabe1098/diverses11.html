</PRE>
<P>
The eight public release of AmIRC, version 2.1, is now available!
</P><P>
AmIRC is a client for the IRC Internet Relay Chat protocol written by
Oliver Wagner, also the author of VoyagerNG and Microdot II. It is
<B>SHAREWARE</B>.  You can register it easily with the included VaporWare
registration utility at any of our registration sites around the world.
</P><P>
Although AmIRC 2.1 contains numerous more hours of work and thus is
slightly more expensive than AmIRC 1.x, there is <B>NO UPGRADE FEE</B> --
your legal AmIRC 1.x and AmIRC 2.0 keyfile will continue to work.  The
free upgrade is our "Thank you!" to all the people who already
registered AmIRC 1.x, instead of using cracked versions, pirated key
files or "evaluation periods" of several months or even years.
Registrations at the AmIRC 1.x price are <B>no longer accepted</B> as of
the 2.0 release.
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>
    Single window mode. You can join several channels with opening
    just a single window.
    <BR><BR>
  </LI><LI>
    Total queueing. Now everything which isn't urgent (like
    KICKS or MODE changes) is sent through the output queue.
    to reduce risk of being kicked by a server due to flooding.
    <BR><BR>
  </LI><LI>
    Settable scrollback buffer size. The amount of text stored
    in a window's scrollback buffer is now limited; the number
    of lines to keep can be configured.
    <BR><BR>
  </LI><LI>
    Vapor Update Library. Will now automagically check for
    available updates during startup, and inform you if there
    is one -- which you can automatically download, too.
    <BR><BR>
  </LI><LI>
    New plugin API calls. On request by plugin authors, several
    new callbacks and functions have been implemented in the
    AmIRC plugin API.

    about the number of messages in each window.
    <BR><BR>
  </LI><LI>
    New low-level Plugin API. Documentation of the API is available from
    www.vapor.com or Aminet, in a separate archive. An example plugin,

    networks.

    DCC. Activate the "Use MIMEPrefs to view?" or "Use MIMEPrefs to save?"
    menu options.
    <BR><BR>
  </LI><LI>
    "Lag-O-Meter" (tm ;)) probes the IRC server every 30 seconds and shows
    the current lag from 0-10+ in a gauge below the userlist. The Info
    window also contains the three most recent measurements and the
    average.
    <BR><BR>
  </LI><LI>
    Heavily improved logging. All channel and query windows now have an
    "L" button to the right of the input gadget, which is a toggle button
    to activate the logging to a user-specified directory.
    <BR><BR>

    "Favorites" window added to store the names of channels you use
    regularly. Click on the channel name in a window to open.

    AmIRC now uses NList.mcc (if available) for its listviews. NList is
    written by Gilles Masson (<A HREF="mailto:masson@iut-soph.unice.fr">masson@iut-soph.unice.fr</A>).
    <BR><BR>
  </LI><LI>
    Stronger CTCP flood protection.
    <BR><BR>
  </LI><LI>
    DCC connections now work with Miami's SOCKS support.

    in progress (esspecially for all you mp3 freaks out there :-)
