Visual Inspirations is proud to announce the long awaited update to their 
popular Control Tower software for the Newtek Toaster Flyer. CT is the 
perfect front end for Nova Design's ImageFX software and helps automate 
Image processing of Flyer Clips.
</P><P>
We have spent the past 6 months working with the folks at OZware to come up 
with over 350 new functions for the Flyer. Control Tower is the first in a 
long line of new products to take advantage of these new commands.
</P><P>
Control Tower now has over 300 Macros designed to make Flying just a little 
bit easier. For those that have the latest version of ImageFX, we have 
added many new macros to use the new hooks they have included. We have also 
made good use of tools from ProWave. You can now process a Flyer Clip in 
ImageFX and have the audio automatically added back in, if you own ProWaves 
software package.
</P><P>
Control Tower has a totally new interface, that opens right on the Flyer 
screen itself. Complete with graphics and documents on each Macro. We have 
also updated Flyer Menu to handle over 900 functions. The new version 
supports Control Tower, OZWares Co-Pilot series, and ProWaves tools all in 
one pull down menu on the Flyer screen.
</P><P>
Current Control Tower users should contact Visual Inspirations direct, for 
upgrade information. If you are a registered user, you should recieve news 
through the mail in the next week.
</P><P>
Control Tower is available through all major Amiga dealers in the US and 
Canada.
