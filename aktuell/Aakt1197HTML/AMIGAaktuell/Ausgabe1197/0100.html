&#171;9/26/1997<P>
<B>PRODUCT NAME</B><P>
  A1400T<P><BR>
<B>BRIEF DESCRIPTION</B><P>
The A1400T is basically an A1200 - with the easy expandability of
the "big box" Amigas such as the A4000T<P>
It consists of an A1200 main board, a built in 150watt power supply,
an expansion board with 5 zorro II slots &amp; 1 inline video slot, one
standard Amiga 880k floppy drive, standard 1200 keyboard in a seperate
case, and a mouse.  The A1200 board has the 3.1 workbench ROM installed,
and the A1200 manual and 3.1 workbench manual are included.<P><BR>

<B>INSTALLATION</B><P>
The A1400T comes in an Infinitiv case which has an extra floppy drive
bay, a 3.5" hard drive bay, and 2  5.5" bays included, and more snap on
modules are available if this is not enough for your needs.  The case can
even be expanded in height if you need more 5.5" bays. There is also
space at the back for several more 3.5" bays but the actual bays are not
included, so you would need to get these separately.  All the 3.5" HD
bays have removable face-plates at the rear of the case.  The face-plate
for the second floppy drive is moulded into the front of the case rather
than a snap out panel like the 5.5" bays have, so you might have to do
some surgery to install a second floppy (such as remove it's face plate).<P>
All the above mentioned extras were formerly used in my now dead A2500,
and were removed and installed in the new tower.  Installation of all of
them was quite simple, easier even than the installation in the old 2500,
as the Infinitiv case is very well designed, and all the panels snap in
and out.  The only problems I encountered were due to the fact that the
plastic drive bays are thicker than the metal ones in the 2500, I had to
replace the mounting screws for the hard drive and CDROM with slightly
longer ones.  In my case this was a simple matter of a dig through my
junk box, but if you don't have one of these you will need to go buy some
appropriate screws.<P>
Of course if you are not comfortable with working on the innards of your
computer you will want to have any hardware additions or transfers done
by a qualified service man or a knowledgeable friend, but if you have
done this kind of thing on a "big box" Amiga before, you will have no
trouble with this one.<P>
<B>FIRST IMPRESSIONS</B><P>
The first thing I noticed when I turned my new system on was how quiet it
is. I immediately put my hand over the fan outlet on the power supply,
thinking the fan was not working.  It was!  The fan on my 2500 was quite
noisy, and was one of the only things I did not like about that machine.<P>
Since the A2500 I had previously been using had a FPU, MMU, and 4M 32 bit
ram which I could not transfer to the A1400T (they are all on the 2620
accelerator card) I expected some initial loss of performance compared to
the A2500.  I was surprised to find that everything seemed to run just as
fast as before. In fact, some things seemed to go faster!  For example,
web page graphics seem to load faster, probably because it is easier to
remap the pictures to 256 colours than to the 16 I was restricted to with
my old ECS system.  And a multi-coloured workbench screen goes just as
fast as the 8 coloured screen I had used with the 2500.  On the 2500, I
had tried a 16 colour screen, but this had produced a noticeable
slowdown. The A1400T can handle 256 colours with no performance loss!<P>
Please note than these are subjective comparisons, and programs such as
SysInfo do report the expected loss in speed.  My impressions might be
due to the way I use my system, the efficiency of the AGA chipset, the
difference between theoretical calculations and "real world" results, or
a combination of all. And I do plan to add an accelerator as soon as
finances permit.<P><BR>
<B>REVIEW</B><P>
I will not spend a lot of space reviewing the basic A1200 part of the
system, as the A1200 has been around for a while, and most people are
familiar with it by now.  If you have never tried an Amiga with the AGA
chipset, I will say that it is a huge improvement, and makes available to
you many programs which won't run without it. The extra Meg of chip ram
is also a big improvement over the 1M I had previously.<P>
As far as software compatibility, I have found very few programs that
worked on my old system that gave problems on this one.  The few I did
find problems with were easily corrected with degrader, or by booting in
ECS emulation on the Early Startup menu.  These were all old PD games.<P>
The Infinitiv tower case itself is a work of art.  It is good looking and
very easy to work on.  It is coloured in what I call "computer off-
white", the same as most peripherals you will find.  It matches perfectly
with my monitor, printer, modem, and speaker system.  It has a nice
sculptured look without being overdone.  The keyboard case is also more
rounded and modern looking than my old 2000 keyboard.  I should say here
that I never have been a big fan of those industrial grey systems, nor
the "bat-wing" style of keyboards.  To me, beauty and functionality must
go hand in hand, and Infinitiv has hit the mark here!  You can also, if
you wish, use a PC keyboard, as the system has a built-in adaptor and the
plug is the same. Perhaps I am missing something here, but I never
understood why you would want to use a PC keyboard.  Do they have
something that is missing on the Amiga keyboard?  Maybe you need to do
this if you have a bridge-board, which the A1400T also allows.<P>
The case has a front-mounted power button and power indicator light, and
below this a reset button which has a light for your hard drive included.
At first I thought this was rather silly, since the reset button does the
same warm-reboot as the [Ctrl][Amiga][Amiga] combination, but I have now
become spoiled, and use the reset button exclusively.  (I do a lot of
programming on my Amiga, so I wind up re-setting much more often than
most!)<P>
The inside of the case is just as well designed as the outside, all slots
are properly aligned, everything snapped apart and together correctly,
the power supply has several of the standard size connectors you will
need, and all my peripherals fit easily into their intended locations.
And all work just as they did before.<P>
Please note that the flicker-fixer I installed in my A1400T is not really
necessary, as the OS will allow you to mode-promote your screens to be
compatable with a VGA or Multi-synch monitor, but this requires an
adaptor to attach the monitor's cable to the standard Amiga monitor port.
The adaptor is NOT included with the system, and I already had the
flicker-fixer, so I installed it - and it works fine.<P>
So, in short, what I now have is the equivalent of adding the AGA chipset
to my old system, combined with the benefits of the new case, and the
ability to use one of the low-cost A1200 accelerators!  This unit is the
perfect upgrade path for me.  I have long wanted to upgrade my system,
but couldn't afford a new A4000 and didn't want to get an A1200 due to
the difficulty of expanding it even enough to just duplicate my old
A2500.<P>
If you are still using a 500, 600, 2000, or 3000 and have been wanting to
upgrade, here is the machine you have been waiting for!  There are also
two other models, the A1300 which does not have the zorro slot board, and
the A1500 which has zorro III slots, and a processor slot for A3000/4000
accelerator cards.  And all for less than half the cost of an A4000T.  If
you currently own an A1200, the case itself and all the internal
components are also available separately.<P>
<B>DOCUMENTATION</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>A standard A1200 manual is included.
<LI>A workbench 3.1 manual is also included
<LI>No documentation for the case is included
<LI>Also not included are the 3.1 DOS and AREXX manuals that come with the
<LI>3.1 upgrade kit.
</UL><P><BR>
<B>LIKES</B><P>
I like EVERYTHING about it (as if you couldn't tell by now!)<P><BR>
<B>DISLIKES</B><P>
My only (minor) complaint would be the lack of any sort of documentation
on the case.  Although it is pretty easy to figure out, some brief
descriptions and diagrams would have been nice.  Perhaps this lack was
due to the rush to get these out to the dealers or something similar, as
I have one of the first available units.  (I ordered it the instant I saw
they were available)<P><BR>
<B>SUGGESTIONS</B><P>
I am sure they have already thought of this, but I would like to see some
models available with a hard-drive, a bit of extra ram, and a software
bundle. A model like that could, with proper marketing, actualy sell to
NEW Amiga users.  I am thinking especially of the old magazine ads for
the Volkswagon Beatle, which sold a ton of these small economy cars in
the USA at a time when everybody thought you needed a car the size of a
battleship with a motor capable of propelling a 100 car freight train.
These ads did it not by directly comparing the car to others available,
but by subtly allowing you to draw the only logical conclusion: that you
really didn't want the big gas-guzzeling dinosaur when your needs could
be served just as well by the Beatle.<P><BR>
<B>VENDOR SUPPORT</B><P>
I have had no need to contact the vendor, the unit was delivered on time
(actually less time than they said), properly packed, and in perfect
working order.<P><BR>
<B>CONCLUSIONS</B><P>
This is truly an excellent product, and I expect they will sell a lot of
these.  If money is no object, an A4000 is still the ultimate Amiga, but
if you are looking for a lower cost option, this is the way to go!  And
you still have the capability to upgrade as your budget allows.  A new,
expandable Amiga in a beautiful tower case for less than the cost of a
"budget" PC?  How could you go wrong?<P>
I take my hat off to Micronik, Infinitiv, and Gateway 2000 for this
excellent product, and to Software Hut for their excellent service.<P><BR>
