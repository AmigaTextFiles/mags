Editor's Corner             by @{"Lori Vinciguerra" link P6}

Happy New Year everyone!  A warm thank you to everyone who has
supported my idea for an educator's newsletter.  I have received
letters and e-mail from all over the world telling me of Amiga labs and
teachers who are using our favorite machine.  It is encouraging
to know that there are so many Amigas being used for educational
purposes.  I hope that this newsletter is useful for all of you.

Well, here we are in 1995 and still there is no resolution to the
Commodore buyout situation.  Now more than ever it is important for
groups of Amigans to band together to support the machine and its
hardware and software developers.  There are many companies which will
inevitably move on to other platforms.  However, many companies are
sticking with the Amiga and waiting for the outcome of the proceedings.

As educators and people interested in education, our interests include
informing the new owners of the Amiga technology of the importance of
educational software products. The list of schools using Amigas for
education is growing and will be an important part of showing the new
owners that there is significant interest in this area.  Just imagine
the impact that placing Amigas in key school districts would have on
the attitudes of people who are making the decisions to purchase
computers.  Once the capability of the machine and its software is
demonstrated, and there is confidence in the viability of the new Amiga
manufacturers, people may no longer say, "What should we buy, a Mac or
a PC?".  But rather, "Let's make sure that we check out the Amiga!"  It
is clear that the Amiga is an excellent choice for educators.  Hardware
and software costs are low,the multimedia capability is excellent, the
machine is easy to use, and (hopefully) the people who make the Amiga
know that education is important.

I intend to include the new owners on my distribution list for this
newsletter.  Your stories on the successful integration of Amigas into
your school system would make excellent articles for all to read.  I
would encourage people to send in their stories for the April edition
by March 15, 1995.  You may email them to owl@davinci.reading.ma.us.
Hopefully by that point the Amiga should be back in production. Your
contributions to the AEL will help it be interesting and successful.

At last there is a product for the Amiga computer where young children can
have fun learning about music! WindShadow Software has introduced "Making
Music with Bertie Bunny". This is a product that is only available for the
Commodore Amiga computer. It fully employs the multimedia capabilities of
the computer.

There are many features to enhance your enjoyment:

- Fun for children of all ages. Even a 2 year old can "Bang Keys"
  to control Bertie. Bertie Bunny will  automatically move from
  place to place on the display. The child can simply bang on the
  keys to cause Bertie to choose an  instrument or tune.

  Older children can use the mouse. This makes it quicker to make
  selections and helps them to develop fine motor skills.

- Learn to recognize the sound of various musical instruments.

- Learn to recognize various musical tunes from one or more of 4
  different parts: the melody, a counterpoint to the melody,
  an obbligato  accompaniment or a rhythmic accompaniment.

- Hear how different instruments sound in combination with each other.

- Use the computer keyboard as a musical instrument. You can
  select which instrument sounds are to be used and then play
  notes (up to 4 at a time will sound) and see the corresponding
  key-presses on a piano keyboard.

- Readily installs on a hard drive. Installation uses Commodore's
  Installer utility.  The Installer program is supplied
  under license from Commodore.

- Supports the NTSC and PAL video standards and 6 languages.

- Multitasks on the more powerful models of Amiga. Other
  software can run in the background at a low priority, for example,
  3D rendering, compiling large programs, or downloading batches of
  files.

- the manual is in AmigaGuide format. The AmigaGuide program
  is supplied under license from Commodore.

This product is unusual in that it is easy to use for children as young as
2 years old, while providing creative opportunities for older children to
explore.

WindShadow Software is a Canadian company providing products for the
Commodore Amiga which are sold world-wide.

Requirements:  AmigaDOS 2.0 or greater and 1 megabyte of RAM.

@node P3 "Amiga Labs in Canada               by Lori Vinciguerra"
@toc "menu"

After sending out the first issue of the AEL newsletter, I received
e-mail from many educators in Canada.  Canadians seem to have
discovered the usefulness of the Amiga and have been able to introduce
it into their school systems.  For example, in Vancouver, British
Columbia, there is a school district (Alberni) which has Amigas in all
of their elementary classes. Over 150 machines are in operation!  They
also have Amigas in the secondary art rooms and in the media production
class at the Senior High.  Here they are doing animations and using the
Video Toaster.  Bob Herbison (bherbiso@cln.etc.bc.ca) helped organize
and run a group called AmUsEd (Amiga Using Educators of B.C.).  They
have hosted numerous summer workshops for educators over the years.
Our hats off to this group!

Also in Vancouver there is a report that the Emily Carr Institute of
Art and Design (ECAID) uses Amigas for its dedicated sound and video
digitizing stations.  There is also an Amiga 1000 dedicated to
character generation in the film and video department.

The Vancouver school board runs some Amiga courses, such as Intro to
AmigaDOS, Intro to Computer Graphics, and Desktop Video, as part of its
adult education program.  They have a lab of sixteen Amiga 2000's which
is sometimes used by daytime secondary teachers.

Now, on to Toronto!  Keith Stainton, former computer coordinator in his
school district is responsible for helping to place a few million
dollars worth of Amigas in their 25 schools.  One school has a lab of
34 Amigas!  At the secondary level, Amigas are used in art and
multimedia. In the intermediate grades, Amigas are used for
wordprocessing and DPaint.  Four of the five intermediate schools have
Amiga labs of at least 32 machines! Some of these are networked, while
some are stand-alone. At the elementary level, most classrooms have an
Amiga with various software titles.

Also in the Toronto area, Stephen Leacock Collegiate (Scarborouh,
Ontario) has a multimedia lab and a television studio run by their
technology department.  They are very enthusiastic about the Amiga.
Many of the students there make use of the Amigas to create multimedia
presentations, as well as interactive communications.  They also run a
school BBS called the Leacock Lions BBS (416-396-6153) on an A600HD
with ethernet connections to other Amigas on a LAN.

In Calgary there is the group AMUC (Amiga Users of Calgary). Their
meetings are the third Wednesday of the month at the Jenkins Theatre at
Mount Royal College.  They even have a BBS (403-282-5171/5137/5238/522)
that you can call for more information. This group has one of the
largest memberships in the world and just recently celebrated their
100th meeting.

I'm sure that there are many more instances of Amigas being used in the
Canadian school systems.  It is encouraging to know that it is possible
for the Amiga to make inroads at all levels of education.  I hope that
these examples give some of you the incentive to keep presenting the
Amiga as a possible platform.  Perhaps one of the Amiga advocates
mentioned in this article can even give you some clues to their success
in this area.

Schools are using Amigas

The following is a list of schools with Amiga Labs.  If there are more of
you out there or if any of these no longer exists please let us know. We
will attempt to maintain an updated list and publish it in the AEL
newsletter on a regular basis. As you can see from the current list, we
are interested in all levels of schooling, from K-12 to college.  I have
received many inputs for the list this month.  I have also included the
list from "Famous Amiga Uses" compiled by David Tiberio and available on
