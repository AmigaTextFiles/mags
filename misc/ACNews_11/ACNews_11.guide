@{FG Shine}Welcome to @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 11th issue of @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}.

First  of  all,  I  would like to apologize for the delay of the release of this
issue.  I  wanted to release it on May, 24th, but because of the recent moves at
Amiga  (all  of  them positive), I was not able to edit the magazine. Anyway, it
is very likely that future issues will appear at the very end of the month.

So much things to speak about and so little space in this editorial. Let's start
with  Jim  Collas.  If  you have read these editorials, you probably know by now
that  I have criticized Amiga a lot in the Jeff's times. But things have changed
a  lot.  It's  true  that  there are not new products yet, but things are moving
faster and faster.

I  think  Jeff  Schindler knows what to do, but Jim Collas knows how to do these
things  happen  and not to spoil the weak hopes of the Amiga community. Amiga is
opening new ways of communication, hiring people with experience in the computer
industry,  and  releasing some drawing concepts for future Amiga projects ... In
short,  they  are in the right way for the success. Read more about this in this
issue.

The  first  Amiga  product  is not going to be a full computer, that's for sure.
Probably  we  are  going to see something like the CD32 in an A500 style, as the
first step  to  connect  all  the  electric  appliances  in  a house. And with a
transparent capability to access the Internet.

Just  imagine. I want to read the news from the Yahoo website. But I am 70 years
old  without  any  experience  with  computers.  Or  even  I  have  some  visual
deficiencies  (this  is for you johnnie :)). I use a wireless LCD tablet or even
pressing  a  key,  this  powerful multimedia computer (or information appliance)
connects  to  Yahoo  and instead of reading the news from an screen, I hear them
because the speech capability of the computer.

Sometimes (or very often), we forgot blind people. The current Amiga was able to
speak  from the very beginning, but it is not able to use this capability to the
full,  so blind people need to do tricks to read the Internet or even electronic
magazines.  We,  the  editors  of electronic magazines, need to pay attention to
them in order to make easy the reading of our mags.

If Amiga is going to succeed, it needs to speak from the very beginning. Support
for  blind  people  is  necessary.  The  competence  is  doing  it. Microsoft is
developing  special versions of Windows for blind people. As Amiga is developing
a full operating environment for home devices, this support is a must.

@{U}@{B}HERETIC V1.1 @{UB}AVAILABLE@{UU}

From: "@{I}Sebastian Jedruszkiewicz@{UI}" @{I}<bjsebo@jota.ii.tuniv.szczecin.pl>@{UI}

Hello.

@{B}Heretic v1.1 @{UB}has been send to @{B}Aminet@{UB}.

New in v1.1
  * I  think  I  have  finally  fixed  the  bug  that  caused crash on exit with
    'directcgx' enabled. But who knows?
  * added  '-instrfile'  switch.  Can  be used to specify MIDI_Instruments file.
    Optimized 'hereticsound.library' a bit. Bumped version to 38.1
  * fixed  a lot of enforcer hits. Now it should be stable, also in @{B}WOS @{UB}version.
    I  think  I  should  be more carefully when I will try to optimize something
    next time ;)
  * fixed hicolor routines in doublebuffered mode. Worked wrong on @{B}cgfx@{UB}.
  * fixed fps counter drawing in hicolor, on @{B}cgfx @{UB}display.

Now enjoy ;)

@{U}@{B}SHOGO @{UB}COMING TO THE @{B}AMIGA@{UB}@{UU}

OK,  for all those that are eager for new games, here's a press release from the
new company @{B}Hyperion@{UB}.

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

@{B}Hyperion @{UB} is  pleased to announce that it has (in close co-operation with @{I}Stuart
Walker @{UI}from @{B}Digital Images@{UB}) acquired the rights from @{B}Monolith @{UB}to port @{B}Shogo@{UB}, the
highly acclaimed @{B}PC @{UB}game, to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

@{B}Shogo @{UB}is a high-end 3D shooter with anime/manga (Japanese cartoons) elements and
is based on the @{B}LithTech @{UB}(tm) engine developed by @{B}Monolith @{UB}(@{B}www.lith.com@{UB}).

As part of the deal with @{B}Monolith@{UB}, @{B}Hyperion @{UB}will port the @{B}LithTech @{UB}engine, which
is the most advanced 3D game engine around, to the @{B}Amiga @{UB}for future licensing by
@{B}Monolith@{UB}.

@{B}Shogo @{UB}will require a @{B}PPC @{UB}equipped @{B}Amiga @{UB}(@{B}WarpOS@{UB}) and will take full advantage of
3D accelerators through @{B}Warp3D@{UB}.

No  release  date  has been set yet but it is likely this will be 3rd quarter of
1999.

The   @{B}Hyperion @{UB}  team  consists  of  @{I}Thomas @{UI} and  @{I}Hans-Joerg  Frieden @{UI} (@{B}Warp  3D@{UB}
co-authors),  @{I}Christian  Sauer @{UI} who  was  involved  with  various  projects like
@{B}Descent@{UB}, and others.

@{B}Hyperion @{UB} is  a  newly  founded  Belgian-German  software  company  dedicated to
bringing high-end @{B}PC @{UB}titles to @{B}PPC @{UB}equipped @{B}Amiga@{UB}s.

For  those that don't know @{B}Shogo@{UB}, it is some game similar in concept to @{B}Quake @{UB}or
@{B}Unreal@{UB}.  The  game  itself  has an Anime-Style background and is centered around
MCA's, or Mobile Combat Armours, which are some kind of @{B}BattleMech@{UB}'s.

The game is pretty high-specced, and will most likely be @{B}PowerPC@{UB}-Only...

@{U}@{B}ISENGARD @{UB}RELEASE @{B}EUCALYPTUS @{UB}SOURCE CODE@{UU}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

Contact: @{I}isengard@geocities.com@{UI}

April  23, 1999 - After much deliberation, we have decided to release the source
code to the @{B}Amiga @{UB}version of @{B}Eucalyptus@{UB}. It may seem coincidental to the growing
popularity  of the open source movement given the current rise of @{B}Linux@{UB}, and, in
all  honesty, that was a big influence in this decision. But this is also a gift
to  the  @{B}Amiga @{UB}community. There have been many things changing here recently, in
our  lives, both personal and professional, and we find that there is not enough
time to do all the things we want and still provide a quality and timely product
to  you, the devoted @{B}Amiga @{UB}user. So we offer up this source as a gift to you, to
mold  and  shape,  and, hopefully, to give back, so that we may all benefit from
it.

You         can         download         the        source        code        at
@{B}linux.tc3net.com/gandalf/download/source/Eucalyptus.lha@{UB}.  We hope that you enjoy
perusing  and using it, and we ask that if you make any improvements, changes or
additions,  please  let  us  know, so that we can incorporate it into our source
tree. In the future, a CVS server will be put up so that you can check it in and
out while maintaining one central site.

@{B}Isengard Developments @{UB}can presently be found at @{B}linux.tc3net.com/gandalf@{UB}.

@{U}NEXT @{B}ALIVE @{UB}RELEASES@{UU}

From: @{I}stevenalive@innotts.co.uk@{UI}

Hello,

As you may have read on our web site this week, @{B}Alive mediasoft @{UB}have signed up a
brand  new  game  called  @{B}Moonbases@{UB}. This is a futuristic war strategy game by a
group  of  talented people who go by the name of @{B}Homegrown Software@{UB}. The game is
now  complete  and  has  already  received  some  good publicity, so the planned
release date is May 18th.

Following much success with @{B}The Prophet@{UB}, @{B}Alive @{UB}will be investing heavily in game
publishing.  After much deliberation, we have decided that our future games will
no  longer  be  released  on  floppy  disk, all projects are CD only. In another
effort to keep the @{B}Amiga @{UB}with the times, we are pushing our development teams to
write for graphics cards and @{B}PPC@{UB}.

@{B}Alive@{UB}'s game schedule is as follows:

+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| CD catalogue 1.3 | Out Now                                                  |

@{U}NEW @{B}AMIGA @{UB}POSTER AVAILABLE@{UU}

From: "@{I}Janne Siren@{UI}" @{I}<siren@dns.mikrobitti.fi>@{UI}

A new @{B}Amiga @{UB}poster is available. It shows a Boing ball held up by hands with the
text "The spirit of @{B}Amiga@{UB}" and a world map pasted on the Boing ball surface. See
the picture at:
    @{B}www.amiga.com/diary/1999/990503-e.html@{UB}

Personally  I  like  the idea, but the outcome seems to me a lot weaker than the
previous  posters.  The hands, especially the two rightmost ones, seem to be too
real  and  sharp in comparison to the soft, abstract Boing ball. The contrast is
just  too strong and it really makes the whole poster look a litte strange in my
opinion.

I guess there should be more hands and they should somehow look more abstract to
reduce contrast. Really not the best @{B}Amiga @{UB}poster yet. IMHO.

@{B}GVP @{UB} - once famous for really nice hardware - have been very quiet lately to say
the  least. But they are obviously not as dead as one might have thought. A look
at  the  last  page  of  the  latest issue of @{B}AmigaOS @{UB}(rather young German print
magazine) shows a @{B}GVP @{UB}ad that does not only feature some @{B}68k @{UB}based accelerators,
genlocks, @{B}GSS+ @{UB}sampler etc. but also an amazing announcement...

Apparently they are developing a @{B}PPC @{UB}board! It reads:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attention !!!!!!!!!
We are developing a @{B}PPC @{UB}accelerator for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.
Planned are cards for @{B}A1200@{UB}, @{B}A2000 @{UB}and @{B}A3@{UB}/@{B}4000@{UB}.

Now that's what I call news. :)

the  speed of the same module running on a native @{B}68060 @{UB}processor. In many cases
the effects become nearly real-time!

@{B}PowerStation @{UB} premiered  to record crowds at the @{B}Amiga '99 @{UB}show in St. Louis and
became  the  'must-have'  item  of  the  show  with  preorders greatly exceeding
expectations!

@{I}@{B}PowerStation @{UB}Specifics@{UI}

The  @{B}PowerPC @{UB} effects  are  for  use with @{B}ImageFX 3.2 @{UB}or higher only. This first
volume  of  modules  includes the following effects, which have all received the
@{B}PowerPC @{UB} treatment.  The  first  five  modules  were  originally  announced  and
premiered at the show - by release we have now added three more!

  * @{I}Bubble @{UI} - creates multiple bubbles over your selected image. You can control
    the  animation  and optional color of the bubbles easily. Create an undersea
    effect or psychedelic champagne bubbles!

  * @{I}Fire @{UI} -  one  of  @{B}ImageFX@{UB}'s most popular effects. Fire can create flickering
    candle   flames,  gas-stove  flames,  raging  forest  fires  and  more.  All
    parameters can be animated or controlled through a single slider.

  * @{I}Clouds @{UI} -  recently  added  to @{B}ImageFX@{UB}, the @{I}Clouds @{UI}effect can create amazing
    multi-layered  fractal  clouds.  It  can also be used to create fog or smoke
    over  images,  simulated explosions, or even seamless textures of landscapes
    with cloud patterns animating across them.

  * @{I}Liquid @{UI}- this is an endlessly fascinating effect that distorts your image as
    if  it  were  on water. You can create funhouse mirror distortions or unique
    video transitions with this effect.

  * @{I}@{B}FXForge @{UB}@{UI} -  based  on  the  same  formulas  used in @{B}Adobe Photoshop@{UB}'s @{B}Filter
    Factory @{UB} package,  @{B}FXForge @{UB} can  create an infinite number of custom special
    effects  using  mathematical  formulas.  Color  effects, distorting effects,
    lighting effects are all possible with this amazing engine. It remains fully
    compatible  with  the  thousands  of  effects  available on the Internet for
    @{B}Adobe@{UB}'s @{B}Filter Factory@{UB}.

  * @{I}Gaussian Blur @{UI}- the cornerstone of many image processing tricks and depth of
    field  effects for videographers, this @{B}PowerPC @{UB}version of @{I}Gaussian Blur @{UI}will
    now allow incredibly fast optical blurring.

  * @{I}JPEG  Loader/Save @{UI} -  one  of the most popular graphics formats to ever come
    along,  JPEG  images  are often a fraction of the original image's size, and
    are  used commonly on the Internet. In the past this size savings was at the
    cost  of  slow loading and saving times. Now these versions load and save so
    fast you may have saved in the time it took you to click your mouse!

@{I}Special Preorder Pricing@{UI}

'@{B}PowerStation@{UB}'  is  available  on diskette for $99.95 and is available from your
favorite   @{B}Amiga @{UB}  dealer.  Outside  the  US  contact  @{B}Oberland @{UB} in  Germany  or
@{B}Wizard@{UB}/@{B}Compute @{UB}in the UK.

If  you  wish  to  order  directly at full retail you can also fax your order to
(804)  282-3768  or  mail  it to @{B}Nova Design, Inc.@{UB}, 1910 Byrd Avenue, Suite 204,
Richmond, VA 23230

'@{B}PowerStation@{UB}'  works  on  any  @{B}Amiga @{UB} equipped  with  a  @{B}PowerUP @{UB} supported @{B}PPC@{UB}
accelerator  with  @{B}ImageFX  3.2 @{UB}or higher installed. @{B}WarpUP @{UB}with the new @{B}PowerUP@{UB}
compatibility should also work as well.

@{U}@{B}STOPMENU @{UB}TO BE FURTHER DEVELOPED@{UU}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

The  original  author  of  the  program  @{B}StopMenu @{UB} @{I}Tom  Wojcik @{UI} has  stopped the
development  of the program as doesn't own the @{B}Amiga @{UB}anymore. As his program was
looking  very  promising  and  it  would  be  a shame to lose the possibility of
further  development and bug fixing, the author decided to hand over the sources
to the new developer.

So,  from  now  on  the  program @{B}StopMenu @{UB}will be developed by me, @{I}Damir Arh@{UI}. At
first  there  won't  be any noticable progress as I have to get to know the code
but after that the development will of course continue. Among the plans there is
localization,  development  of  "Prefs"  program  and  "Menu Editor" in @{B}MUI @{UB}(the
current  versions  won't  be dumped, but further developed), integration of both
the  programs,  proper  installation  script  for  the "Installer" program, more
plugins,  etc.  If you have any other ideas, you are of course free to send them
to my address, which you can find at the bottom of the announcement.

At the same time the registration procedure also changed. As the original author
doesn't  have  anything  to  do  with  the program any more, you should send any
registration  requests  to  me. The registration fee is still 10 USD if you want
the  key  via  e-mail.  If you want it via s-mail, you should send me 15 USD. In
this case you'll receive a 3.5" disk with the keyfile. Just send the cash to the
following address:

    @{I}Damir Arh@{UI}
    Titova 89
    4270 Jesenice
    Slovenia

Don't  forget to include your full name and postal address. And of course e-mail
address  if  you want to receive the key via e-mail. Until further notice paying
the money to a bank account is not possible.

All  further  updates will be available from @{B}Aminet@{UB}. I also have plans to set up
an  official  support  site  for the program. You'll find the link to it from my
personal homepage. It will also probably be announced at @{B}Amiga @{UB}news sites.

I'm  looking  forward to the response of the existing @{B}StopMenu @{UB}users and all new
users  that  have  been  encouraged  to register and support the program by this
announcement.

@{U}@{B}WACOM PENPARTNER DRIVER V1.1 @{UB}AVAILABLE@{UU}

From: @{I}ds @{UI}@{I}<dspach@cybercable.fr>@{UI}

Hello amigans,

Noticed  that some of you are searching for low cost tablet and driver. You will
find the driver for the above mentionned at: @{B}perso.cybercable.fr/dspach@{UB}

features:
  * complete mouse emulation (buttons optional)
  * old and new style tablet events

However,  I  noticed  that  @{B}Amiga @{UB} programs  I  was  able to test do not rely on
intuition tablet events, but rather use their own tablet drivers, or rely on the
@{B}Wacom @{UB}driver released years ago on @{B}Aminet@{UB}.

The  result  of  this is that pressure values sent by the driver are not used by
thoose  apps.  If somebody have some knowledge on the various tablet/app couples
that  are supposed to work, please let me know, so I can fix or use a workaround
to make it work.

Have fun with it !

Hello!

I  want  to  inform  you  that I've created on @{B}EGroups @{UB}one mailing list with the
purpose of help who wants to sell or buy anything related to @{B}Amiga@{UB}: you can send
to  this  list  your ads for sell-buy @{B}Amiga @{UB}hardware or software. The address of
the mailing list is @{I}amimarket@egroups.com@{UI} and it is open to everyone and free.

In the next days I'm going to promote this list and I hope you'll do the same.

Here some advice to make life easier to the users of the list:
  * type  in  the Email subject what you want to sell-buy and, of course, if you
    want to sell or buy it;
  * type  in  the  body  all  useful  information:  price, condition, methods of
    payment;
  * give an address.

And here some rules:
  * only ads for @{B}Amiga @{UB}compatible hardware or software;
  * only used things (no shops).

I'm not responsible for the ads that compare in the list.

Thank you!

Yes it's finally happened.
@{B}Wasted  Dreams @{UB} is sent for pressing and according to CD plant we'll get the CDs

@{I}07.05.1999.@{UI}: What's new in @{B}Wasted Dreams@{UB}?
Are you sick of SMALL ANIMATIONS and BIG BLACK BORDERS around them?
Are  you sick of EXCUSES like "@{B}Amiga @{UB}don't have enough power to play full screen

Well we say NO MORE BLACK BORDERS AND SMALL ANIMATIONS!

@{I}06.05.1999.@{UI}: Why @{B}Wasted Dreams @{UB}is still not released?
Last couple of months we have spent solving publishing and distribution problems
for  @{B}Wasted  Dreams@{UB}. We certainly didn't expect to spend that much time on this,
but the problems were BIG.

@{I}06.05.1999.@{UI}: System crash!
Last  week  we  had  a system crash and because of that we have lost some emails
we've  received.  So if you have contacted us during last three weeks and didn't
received an answer, please contact us again.

Now,  obviously the DVD support is all well and good, but playing back video DVD
will  still  be  impossible  on your humble @{B}Amiga @{UB}until there's a hardware MPEG2
decoder...  so  I suggested that to @{B}Power @{UB}and they're going to make one of those
too! :) Can't wait for DVD on my @{B}Amiga@{UB}...

All the best,

@{U}@{B}THE WORLD FOUNDRY @{UB}NEWS@{UU}

From: @{I}"Ed Collins"@{UI}

Hi,
Many apologies for the big delay in sending out this news.

@{I}News@{UI}

  * @{B}CEG @{UB}update.
  * @{B}Explorer 2260 @{UB}Update.
  * @{B}Maim & Mangle @{UB}Update.
  * Next News Update

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{I}1. @{B}CEG @{UB}update.@{UI}

There  will  be a large addition to the History section over this weekend with a
timeline  for  nearly  every alien race in the game (the others refused :). Some
sections  will  be  removed for a time for some spring cleaning. A brand new @{B}CEG@{UB}
archive will be uploaded at that time also.

@{I}2. @{B}Explorer 2260 @{UB}Update.@{UI}

Not  much  to  report this month. Some GFX data was lost in a HD crash late last
month  and  studies over the next few weeks will slow down graphics done for the
game.

On  the programming aspect, some of the work listed on last months news has been
carried  over  onto this month and @{B}warp3D @{UB}is being studied for using with the 3D
engine.

@{I}3. Maim & Mangle Update.@{UI}

Now  this  really has gone quiet. Varying reasons have delayed work on the game.
Work  has  continued on the object editor and a terrain editor for designing the
units/game maps.

We also have a new GFX artist to help things along who goes by the name of @{I}Marco
Siegel@{UI}.

@{I}4. Next News Update@{UI}

31st May/1st June - No really it will be. :)

All the best,
@{I}Ed@{UI}.

@node not32 "OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY BY JIM COLLAS: MAY 1999"

@{U}OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY BY @{I}JIM COLLAS@{UI}: MAY 1999@{UU}

Dear @{B}Amiga@{UB}ns,

April  was  a  very busy month for @{B}Amiga @{UB}with much activity and good progress. I
received  over  1200  emails  from  people  around  the  world,  I  met with key
representatives  of  the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community in Germany and the U.K, we added to our
executive  staff, we established relationships with key technology partners, and
we finalized our 1999 product plans.

The  amount of emails I received from the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community has been overwhelming.
Most  of them were emails of support and encouragement while many others gave me
suggestions  and  input  on  technology  and  products.  These  emails have been
wonderful.  They are uplifting, insightful, interesting, and fun to read. People
in  this  community  have  a  great  personality.  Many  were  short  emails  of
encouragement  but  just  as  many  went  on for several pages listing insights,
suggestions,  and opinions. Thank you very much for your emails of support. They
have  been  tremendously  encouraging  to the @{B}Amiga @{UB}executive team and me. There
were,  of  course,  also  some  emails sent by @{B}Amiga@{UB}ns who are frustrated by the
situation.  These  emails  were  also  valuable  in  giving  me insight into the
mistakes  of  the past so that I could avoid them as we press toward the future.
Please keep the emails coming.

I apologize for not responding to all of the email sent to me. I have personally
responded  to over 600 emails but was unable to keep up with the volumes. I want
to assure you that I read every email sent to me and that they play an important
role  in defining our future plans. I will continue to respond to as many emails
as  possible  on  a  personal  basis. This brings me to the main subject of this
month's  letter:  communication.  It  is  important  that we set up an effective
process  for  communicating  with  the  @{B}Amiga @{UB}community. Emails and requests for
meetings  are  overwhelming  @{B}Amiga @{UB} executives  at  this  time.  This  volume of
communication  is  very  encouraging but I am concerned that we can't personally
respond to every one of them and it will become frustrating to the community.

We  are  working  on  plans  to  improve  communications  between  @{B}Amiga @{UB}and the
community.  These plans will consist of multiple programs including: the current
executive update, an email response team, a new @{B}Amiga Advisory Council@{UB}, polls on
future  product  features, better monthly user group communication, and improved
communication  to the @{B}Amiga @{UB}press. Detailed information on all of these programs
will be posted on our web site in the next several weeks. In addition to keeping
the community up to date on @{B}Amiga @{UB}activities, the main goal of these programs is
to  involve  the community in setting future @{B}Amiga @{UB}plans. All of us need to work
on  this together to make sure we are setting plans that will help the community
and allow @{B}Amiga @{UB}to drive the next computing revolution.

One  of the planned communications programs is a new @{B}"Amiga Advisory Council" @{UB}or
@{B}AAC@{UB}. The idea for this program came from my discussions with people in the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community.  It  is difficult to get thousands of people involved in our planning
process  so  we need to establish a more manageable forum. The plan is to set up
an advisory council consisting of people that are viewed as leaders in the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community.  Members of this council will be "elected" by the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community. We
are  currently  working  on  the details of the "election" process. This council
must  represent  all  major constituencies of the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community so that we can
get  a  full  set  of  concerns and inputs regarding future @{B}Amiga @{UB}plans. We will
set-up  special  message  boards,  email lists, and meetings allowing the @{B}AAC @{UB}to
communicate  effectively.  Information  on  @{B}AAC @{UB} meetings  and decisions will be
communicated  to  the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community. Keep watching our web site for updates on
this  program.  We  will  also  make  sure  information  gets published to @{B}Amiga@{UB}
magazines and user groups.

In  late  April  I traveled to Germany and the U.K. to meet with representatives
and  leaders  of the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community to discuss @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s future plans and get the
community's  help in setting these plans. I apologize to the people that did not
have  the  opportunity  to  participate  in these meetings but I had to keep the
meetings  to a manageable size. There were about 30 to 40 people in each country
representing  developers, dealers, distributors, user groups, and press. I think
that  these meetings were very informative and productive. They will allow me to
optimize  our  future plans while taking the requirements of the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community
into  account.  To  give  you an example, we spent a considerable amount of time
talking about how to bridge the community from the current @{B}Amiga @{UB}platform to the
next  generation.  The  current  @{B}Amiga @{UB}platform has several years of useful life
remaining  but  people  are not investing in it because it is dated and the next
generation  is  around the corner. One suggestion is to port the next generation
@{B}AmigaSoftTM  Operating  Environment @{UB} (OE)  so  that  it  runs on a current @{B}Amiga@{UB}
configured  with  a  @{B}Power  PC @{UB} expansion  card.  This  would  not be an optimum
configuration  but  it  would  extend the life of current @{B}PowerPC Amiga@{UB}s. We are
looking into this possibility and will keep you updated.

On  a personal note, I had a wonderful time in Germany and the U.K. The trip was
both  productive and very enjoyable. The trip was packed with excellent food and
good  people.  I  really  enjoyed  meeting with people from the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community.
After six years of working with executives in the @{B}PC @{UB}industry, it is a breath of
fresh  air  to  work  with people that have so much passion and enthusiasm about
what  they  believe  in.  I especially enjoyed the extended conversations in the
bars  and  pubs. These tended to get even more passionate and creative. To those
of  you  who  participated  in  the  events, I thank you for making my trip both
productive  and enjoyable. In case you are curious, the most challenging part of
my trip was sitting still while @{I}Petro @{UI}drove me on the autobahn at 240 km/hour. I
thank god for solid and stable German automobiles and good German beer.

Before  I  end  this letter I would like to cover a few more topics that came up
frequently  in  emails  sent  to me. First, I would like to clarify our hardware
product  plans.  @{B}Amiga @{UB}is planning to come out with a next generation multimedia
computer  in late Q4 of the year. This computer will have a unique architecture,
a great operating system, awesome 3D gaming performance, and advanced multimedia
features.  I  am  confident that this computer will meet your expectations for a
great next generation @{B}Amiga@{UB}. Unfortunately, we can't disclose details of the new
computer  yet  since  we are under non-disclosure agreements with our technology
partners.  We  also  need  to  be  careful about alerting our competition to our
plans.  One  thing I can say is that the technology partners we are working with
are  extremely  excited about our direction and technology. There are @{B}Amiga@{UB}ns in
all major technology companies and they are eager to support us in driving a new
computer  revolution. These partners include some major technology and component
companies  in  the computer industry. We should be ready to disclose more at the
@{B}World of Amiga @{UB}and @{B}AmiWest @{UB}shows in July.

The   new   @{B}Amiga @{UB} multimedia  computer  will  also  support  a  home  networked
"information appliance" environment that will allow networked devices throughout
the  house  access to the power and features of this computer. I need to clarify
the  term  "information  appliances"  which  is  becoming  a popular term in the
computer   industry.   "Information   appliances"   are  not  digital  toasters,
refrigerators,  and  ovens  with LCD displays. They are devices such as wireless
LCD tablets, Internet terminals, game machines, and digital set-top boxes. These
devices  will  all  be  connected  together through a single network and will be
integrated into a single comprehensive operating environment. This is the reason
why we use the term "operating environment", or OE, to describe our new software
rather  than  operating  system.  Our  software is much more than the underlying
operating system.

In  addition  to  the  full multimedia computer described above, @{B}Amiga @{UB}will also
develop  reference  designs  for  a variety of "information appliance" companion
devices  such  as  wireless  LCD  tablets.  Our  goal  is  to enable a full home
computing  environment  rather than just a computer. We will encourage others to
develop  and ship @{B}Amiga@{UB}-compatible computers and information appliances. To help
clarify  our  plans to the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community, we are releasing our initial product
concept  to  the  @{B}Amiga @{UB} press  to publish in the next issues. I hope this helps
clarify  our  product plans. We will continue to disclose details as they become
available and as is appropriate.

The second topic that I would like to cover is @{B}Amiga @{UB}support for developers. The
@{B}Amiga @{UB} development  community is important to us and we will be taking an active
role  in support @{B}Amiga @{UB}developers. We are evaluating plans for financial support
as  well as in-depth technical support. We will communicate more about this plan
within 60 to 90 days when we also start releasing more technical information for
developers.

I  have  also  updated  the  "major activities" sub-section under the "executive
update"  section  on  our  web  site. This will give you some more detail on the
status  of  @{B}Amiga @{UB} programs  so I encourage you to read it. We have also added a
Monthly  Questions  and Answers web page to the "executive update" section. This
page will answer the top questions asked in emails sent to me.

In  closing  I  would  like  to  say  that I am more excited then ever about the
opportunities for @{B}Amiga @{UB}and the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community. It has been a long wait but the
@{B}Amiga @{UB}community is still the greatest community in the computer industry and the
time is ideal for a new revolutionary architecture and platform. I will keep you
posted  on  our  progress  and  promise  to  disclose as more details as soon as
possible and appropriate.

Sincerely,
@{I}Jim Collas@{UI}
President, @{B}Amiga@{UB}

    process of evaluation and feature comparisons.

  * @{I}When will we begin seeing advertising for the next generation @{B}Amiga @{UB}? @{UI}
    We  do  not  expect  to  do any external advertising for the new @{B}Amiga @{UB}until
    there are products available through our distribution channels. We are still
    some  months  away  from  that  so  there  are  no  definitive plans for the
    advertising  program.  We  do intend to communicate product availability and
    other   company   activities  through  the  established  @{B}Amiga @{UB} channels  of
    communication prior to general market communications.

  * @{I}Will @{B}Amiga @{UB}have a presence at @{B}Comdex @{UB}this year? @{UI}
    We  are planning activities at the several of the @{B}Amiga @{UB}and general industry
    events.  The  successful  participation  in  a  trade  show like Fall @{B}Comdex@{UB}
    involves a lot of advance planning and having the right message at the right
    time  in  order to gain visibility above the noise level at that show. As we
    get closer to @{B}Comdex@{UB}, we will disclose our plans for participation.

@node not35 "PLAYHD GETS A NEW NAME: AUDIO EVOLUTION"

@{U}@{B}PLAYHD @{UB}GETS A NEW NAME: @{B}AUDIO EVOLUTION@{UB}@{UU}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

It's  my  pleasure  to  announce  that an update of the audio harddisk recording
program @{B}PlayHD @{UB}is available now on my homepage (@{B}www.wentzler.limit.nl@{UB}). The name
has  changed  now  from  @{B}PlayHD @{UB} to @{B}'Audio Evolution' @{UB}and besides this change, a
whole lot of new features have been added since my last demo from January.

For the people who have never heard of @{B}PlayHD @{UB}or @{B}Audio Evolution@{UB}:

@{B}Audio  Evolution @{UB} is  an  audio  harddisk  recording  system  primarily aimed at
musicians   who   want   an  easy-to-use  multitrack  recorder  for  home-studio
applications.  It's  based  on  the  @{B}AHI @{UB} system  by @{I}Martin Blom@{UI}, which makes it
possible  to  run  @{B}Audio  Evolution @{UB}on every modern soundcard designed for @{B}Amiga@{UB}
computers.  Because  of  the  efficient mixing routines of @{B}AHI@{UB}, it's possible to
play  up to 30 tracks at the same time on expanded systems, even without @{B}PowerPC@{UB}
technology. But that's not what makes it a good harddisk recording system: @{B}Audio
Evolution @{UB} also  offers a versatile mixing desk including individual channel and
master  level  display,  mute,  solo,  panning,  subgroups and realtime effects.
Besides  that, full mixer automation gives you mixing possibilities only limited
by  your  imagination.  Also take a look at the timeline display with its marker
system  for  fast  positioning  in  the song, locators and punch in/out features
which saves you precious time in your recording session.

New features since January:
  * Completely new GUI for the mixer window
  * Volume display per channel with PPM meters
  * Resizable timeline
  * Subgroups
  * Realtime FX (no @{B}PPC @{UB}yet :-( )
  * @{B}Bars&Pipes @{UB}start synchronisation
  * CAMD start synchronisation
  * New Record window with record level display
  * etc.

For  a  complete  description  of features, please see my webpages. While you're
there you can even take the tour or download a demo if you like! :-)

If you would like to have more information, please don't hesitate to contact me!

Kind regards,

@{U}FUSION OR SHAPESHIFTER?@{UU}

In article <7gkpgd$6vi$1@news1epix.net> nospam@winbej.fakeisp.com (joe) writes:

> Any thoughts on the advantages and disadvantages to each?....joe

ShapeShifter is free now; there is no demo version of Fusion AFAIK. If you don't
have  a  GFX  card,  Fusion  has  faster  AGA  drivers, and OS8 (not 8.1 or 8.5)
reportedly  runs  better  on  Fusion,  though 8 is a waste, best to stick to the
freely  available  7.5.3 (/.5) or 7.6.1. I use a mix of 7.1 and 7.6.1, since 7.1
is the smallest and fastest of 68k MacOSes.

Others reported networking was easier with ShapeShifter, all I can say that I've
used  PPP  and  TCP/IP  over  Ethernet  in  both Classic and OT flavours without
problems  on ShapeShifter. Also, I tried MacLite 1200 some time ago and had some
filesystem trouble which Shapeshifter never had. On the other hand, I could only
format  a  SCSI  ZIP  with  major  trouble, and transfers to it would eventually
freeze  SS  (the Amiga side had no problems at all with the ZIP). This of course
could have been cybscsi.device, YMMV.

If  you  have  an  060, Fusion also should work better with some apps, or so I'm
told.  My system has trouble with some stuff, mainly M$ Word and MSIE (who would
have  thought..)  where  NS3.04  runs  fine. With some others SS, and especially
older  versions  (3.7)  work better. Also depending on the 68060.library you use
some  apps  work better with an older lib version (here some PhotoShop functions
and plugins crash with the latest libs).

ShapeShifter is now basically unsupported, except perhaps for some minor updates
which still might arrive, Fusion has a helpful and active mailinglist supporting
it,  or  so  I'm  told.  Fusion  PPC  however  is  basically  cancelled, whereas
ShapeShifter's author is working on various versions of Mac emulation which just
might make it to Amiga PPC in some form or the other.

Those  would be the major points I am aware of, the rest is up to you to try and
see what's best. There is no real speed difference between both emulations.

What  a curious letter, is it not? I mean, this is an english e-magazine, rigth?
and  it  came  from  an  spanish  reader  who  (in short) give me thanks for the
e-magazine.  What  can  I  say? I am happy this magazine is keeping you informed
about the Amiga world. By the way, I'm writing for the new brand printed spanish
magazine  "mundo  Amiga"  (as  you  may  expect),  I am responsible for the news
section,  and  I have written some articles about shows and other events. If you
are  interested,  I  could  tell  you  how to subscribe (the only way to get it,
because it does not reach the newsstands). The magazine is very interesting, and
I highly recommend you to subscribe.

Hello Angel,

since  the  7th  issue of ACNews I read your magazine, and every month I like it
more  ;)  Please  keep  the Amiga-Guide-format fore future issues, because it is
functionell and informative.

My  intention  to  write  this  mail is, that ACNews is the only News-magazine I
found  with the possibility to use with the speak.device! You may ask why this??
- because I'm nearly blind and my Amiga has to "tell" me all the news around the
Amiga-World.

I  copy  every  page  to  the  Clipboard  and  from  there I let it speak with a
textspeaking  program  called  WReadFiles(to find in Aminet), this program sorts
out  all  the  textformatting  and  feeds the narrator.device with relevant text
only...

Once again, thanx for your ACNews and keep it going :)))

And sorry for my semanthic-style, english is not my native language 8-)

live long and prosper, johnnie

@node not39 "BEYOND THE FOUR GIGABYTE BARRIER - BY DHOMAS TRENN"

@{U}BEYOND THE FOUR GIGABYTE BARRIER BY @{I}DHOMAS TRENN @{UI}@{UU}

The  following  article  has  been  written by @{I}Dhomas Trenn @{UI}and was published by
@{B}NewTekniques @{UB}magazine (an US magazine) in October 1998, and recently updated. As
it is interesting I have decide to publish it.

@{B}Amiga @{UB}has announced that @{B}OS 3.5 @{UB}will contain support for hard-drives larger than
4  Gigabyte.  It  appears,  based on the the information contained on the @{B}OS 3.5@{UB}
feature  list,  that  the  already released @{B}New Style Device @{UB}(@{B}NSD@{UB}), as discussed
below, is the official supported standard.

It  is  important  to  realize,  that  the  added @{B}NSD @{UB}support does NOT mean that
software  that  uses a custom file system, such as @{B}MovieShop@{UB}, will now work with
larger  hard-drives.  If  this  software didn't work without @{B}NSD@{UB}, it still won't
work with it.

Also,  hard drive applications such as @{B}DiskSalv@{UB}, @{B}Ami-Back Tools@{UB}, etc. will still
not work properly, unless they are updated to support @{B}NSD@{UB}. @{B}OS 3.5 @{UB}is expected to
include   updated   versions  of  @{B}Info@{UB},  @{B}Format@{UB},  @{B}Diskcopy@{UB},  @{B}FastFileSystem @{UB} and
@{B}HDToolBox@{UB}.

A  year  or so ago, I purchased two @{B}Quantum Fireball @{UB}4.3 Gigabyte (GB) hard disk
drives.  One  was  intended  for  @{B}AmigaDOS @{UB} storage  and  the other for use with
@{B}MovieShop @{UB} and the @{B}V-Lab Motion @{UB}video card. What I thought would be a simple and
somewhat  ordinary  task  of  setting up a couple hard disks, turned out to be a
great nightmare of confusion and misinformation.

There  has  been  a  great deal of discussion about this topic in newsgroups and
emailing   lists   lately.  Unfortunately,  there  is  also  a  huge  amount  of
misinformation floating around - which, I suspect, has confused some people.

If you are planning on using a hard disk larger than 4 Gigabytes with the @{B}Amiga@{UB},
whether it be for video purposes or other, there are a few things you need to be
aware  of. Note that applications that bypass the @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s file system may not be
affected by this problem.

* The First Signs of Trouble

I  set  out  to  configure one drive as a single 4.3 Gigabyte @{B}AmigaDOS @{UB}partition
using  @{B}HDToolBox@{UB}.  By default @{B}HDToolBox @{UB}sets up two partitions, so I deleted the
second  partition  and proceeded to maximize the first one. I dragged the little
pointer  all the way to the end, only to discover that my 4.3 Gigabyte hard disk
had  suddenly  shrunken to only 14 Megabytes (Meg) - or so @{B}HDToolBox @{UB}was telling
me.  I  slid  the  slider back a bit and watched carefully as I increased it one
position at a time... 4093 Meg, 4094, 1 Meg, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14 Meg. Something was
seriously wrong.

As  a computer programmer, I recognized what the error was right away; but, that
did not mean that I immediately knew how to solve the problem.

* What is Really Going On?

It  is  not  too  difficult to understand what causes the 4+ GB problems, though
perhaps a little bit technical (bare with me for a minute). Simply put, @{B}AmigaDOS@{UB}
uses  32-bit  pointers  to  reference positions on a hard disk and therefore can
reference a maximum of 2^32 bytes or 4,294,967,296 (4 GB) - Note that, with some
older  SCSI controllers and devices the limitation is actually 2 Gigabytes. Many
years ago, nobody expected that we would want to be using storage media as large
as  we  do  today.  Understandable  perhaps,  consider that my first computer, a
@{B}Commodore PET 2001@{UB}, only had 8,192 BYTES of RAM. That was a lot back then!

If  a  program  attempts to read or write data to an area of the hard disk above
the  4 Gigabyte limitation, the data pointer will 'wrap around' (4,294,967,295 +
1  =  0,  +  2  =  1, etc.). If this happens while the computer is writing data,
existing  information  on  the  lower part of the hard disk will be overwritten.
This  means that data will be lost and very possibly the @{B}Rigid Disk Block @{UB}(@{B}RDB@{UB}),
which  among other things stores the partitioning information for the hard disk,
will be corrupted.

Unfortunately,  all of this happens quietly and without any warning. You may not
even  know  anything  is  wrong  until  it is too late. In particular, the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
generally  only  determines  that  a  hard disk is 'invalid' when it is booting,
otherwise  it tends to assume that everything is normal. So, unless you tried to
access  any  of  the  corrupted  data,  you  would not be aware that there was a
problem. But, when you rebooted the computer you would quickly discover that the
@{B}Amiga @{UB} no  longer  recognized  the  hard disk as valid. If you are really lucky,
restoring  the  @{B}RDB @{UB} would  allow  you  to access some data; but, it is not very
likely.

It  gets  a  little  more  confusing when you try to determine exactly where the
barrier  exists;  because  a  Gigabyte  is  not always a Gigabyte. Have you ever
wondered  why, for example, a 730 Meg hard disk, after formatting, has less than
730  Megabytes  of storage? This is partly because hard disk manufacturers, when
it comes to specifications, speak their own language. They refer to one Megabyte
as  1,000,000 bytes, but any computer programmer will tell you that one Megabyte
is  equal  to 1024 Kilobytes or 1,048,576 bytes, which is what the @{B}Amiga @{UB}thinks,
too.  One  can  only guess what they might be referring to when they say one GB.
Gigabyte envy??

* The Easy Answer

To  avoid the problem, the easiest thing to do is to ignore everything above the
4  Gigabyte  barrier.  It is not very elegant, but it does work 100% without any
system  patches or restrictions. This might not be a particularly great solution
for  larger  drives,  but  for  a  4.3  Gigabyte  drive, you only lose about 150
Megabytes  of  storage.  It  is necessary that you set the lower partition to no
bigger  than  4095  Meg.  To be on the safe side with @{B}AmigaDOS@{UB}, I recommend 3980
Meg.  For  a  4.3  Gigabyte  drive,  that would leave 151 Megabytes for the last
partition. Name it DEAD0 or something similarly obvious and never format it. You
can  further  divide the lower partition into several smaller parts if you wish,
but  make  sure  to  not go above 4095 Meg (or 3980 Meg if you want to be really
safe).  So  that you do not see an icon for DEAD0, make sure that the 'Automount
this partition' option is NOT checked for that partition.

* The Solutions

I  am not convinced that there is one do-it-all solution. I am also not yet sure
that any of the following options work 100%. However, after talking with others,
discussing  this  with  the  appropriate programmers, and through much trial and
error  I have come up with some information that will hopefully help you through
this Giga-craziness.

The  most  important  thing,  and I can not stress it enough, is that you should
backup  ALL  your  hard  disks before you start playing around with any of this.
Technically,  the  only  drive  of  concern  is the one you attempt to use these
patches  with. However, as I have learned too many times, when things get really
frustrating  it is easy to accidently re-format the wrong hard disk. In seconds,
it  will  be  too  late.  Consult  each  program's  documentation  for  detailed
information on supported controllers, setup and usage.

* @{B}New Style Device @{UB}- @{B}NSD@{UB}

The official solution is from @{B}Amiga International Inc. @{UB}and it is the method that
will  most likely remain compatible with future updates to the operating system.
So,  if you can get it to work, it is the best solution. This method is based on
a  device  handling system called @{B}New Style Device @{UB}that was originally developed
for the @{B}Walker@{UB}. @{B}NSD @{UB}is not only a fix for the 4 GB problem, but can also be used
to  improve  performance  of  other  hardware,  among  these:  sana2, serial and
parallel devices.

There  are  three parts: an updated @{B}FastFileSystem @{UB}(FFS43_19.lha), a scsi.device
patch  (SCSI_IDE43_23.lha)  and  the @{B}NSDPatch @{UB}(NSDPatch43_20.lha ) program which
adds support for many third party hard disk controllers.

Currently, @{B}NSDPatch @{UB}includes support for the following controllers and trackdisk
devices:  @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s  scsi.device  and  2nd.scsi.device; @{B}Phase 5@{UB}'s 1230scsi.device,
1260scsi.device,  2060scsi.device  and cybscsi.device; @{B}Draco@{UB}'s dracoscsi.device;
@{B}HiSoft@{UB}'s   squirrelscsi.device;   @{I}Oliver   Kastl@{UI}'s   atapi.device;  @{B}WarpEngine@{UB}'s
warpdrive.device; @{B}DataFlyer@{UB}'s ExpSys.device; @{B}Hardital Synthesis@{UB}' syndisk.device;
@{B}BSC@{UB}'s   oktagon.device;  @{I}Ralph  Babel@{UI}'s  @{B}GuruRom @{UB} omniscsi.device;  @{B}Microbotics@{UB}'
HardFrame.device;   and   the   diskspare.device.  Other  devices  may  also  be
configurable.

First,  it  is  necessary to install the new file system using @{B}HDToolBox@{UB}. In the
main  window, select the appropriate drive and then the 'Partition Drive' gadget
to  get  to  the 'Partitioning' section. By check-marking the 'Advanced Options'
gadget,   select   the  'Add/Update...'  gadget  to  get  to  the  'File  System
Maintenance'  window. If another file system is already listed you should delete
it  first using 'Delete File System'. Select the 'Add New File System...' gadget
to install the new file system.

Then,  if  you  are  using the scsi.device, you should install the SCSI_IDE43_23
patch  appropriate for your machine. Otherwise, you should install @{B}NSDPatch@{UB}. The
current  version  of @{B}NSDPatch @{UB}will not automatically activate partitions above 4
GB.  You  have to specifically tell it to do so in the 'NSDPatch.cfg' file. This
is expected to be changed in a future release.

I  have been using this file system via the @{B}NSDPatch @{UB}with @{B}Phase 5@{UB}'s @{B}CyberSCSI-II@{UB}
module for over a year now, without any problems. You can get this free software
from the @{B}Amiga International @{UB}files area: @{B}www.amiga.de/files/index.html@{UB}.

At  this  stage, the software is still beta; but, it is very stable. These files
are  updated  occasionally,  so  keep  checking  back  for newer versions. These
programs require @{B}OS 3.1@{UB}.

* @{B}Track Disk 64 @{UB}- @{B}TD64@{UB}

@{B}TD64 @{UB} is  a  file system replacement written by @{I}Ralph Schmidt @{UI}(@{B}Phase 5@{UB}) based on
the  @{B}Track  Disk  64 @{UB}standard, which has been defined by an independent group of
third-party  @{B}Amiga @{UB} developers.  It  also requires @{B}OS 3.1@{UB}. Currently, support is
included  for:  @{B}Phase  5@{UB}'s  1230scsi.device,  1260scsi.device,  2060scsi.device,
@{B}Fastlane @{UB} z3scsi.device and cybscsi.device; @{B}BSC@{UB}'s ALF.device and oktagon.device;
@{B}Draco@{UB}'s     dracoscsi.device;    @{I}Ralph    Babel@{UI}'s    @{B}GuruRom @{UB}   omniscsi.device;
trackdisk.device and the carddisk.device.

The  following  devices  are  not  compatible: All @{B}Amiga @{UB}SCSI devices (including
scsi.device,  2nd.scsi.device;  and  hddisk.device);  @{B}GVP@{UB}'s  scsidev.device; and
@{B}Microbotics@{UB}' HardFrame.device. This file system is installed using @{B}HDToolBox@{UB}, in
the  same  way as described above for the @{B}NSD @{UB}file system. You can get this free
software from @{B}Aminet@{UB}: disk/misc/ffstd64.lha

* @{B}Bigdisk@{UB}

@{B}Bigdisk @{UB}is a commercial program written by @{I}Janos Farkas@{UI}. It was designed for use
with  @{B}MovieShop @{UB} (@{B}V-Lab Motion@{UB}) and is currently the only known solution to work
with  it.  However,  it  can  also  be  used  with the @{B}Draco @{UB}and @{B}AmigaDOS 2.0 @{UB}or
greater.  It  has not been tested, but it may even work with earlier versions of
@{B}AmigaDOS@{UB}.

@{B}Bigdisk @{UB} approaches  the 4 Gigabyte barrier in a different way, taking advantage
of  the  SCSI  command  set to access the full capacity of a hard disk. When you
start  the  @{B}Bigdisk @{UB}initializer (Biginit), it overlays a new bigdisk.device over
the  existing  device  (scsi.device or other) and divides the destined hard disk
into  4  Gigabyte  sections,  creating  several virtual drives. @{B}Bigdisk @{UB}'Unit 0'
refers to the first 4 Gigabytes of the original device, 'Unit 1' to the second 4
GB, and so on. Requests sent through @{B}Bigdisk @{UB}are redirected and passed on to the
underlying device which can then handle them properly.

Unlike  with  @{B}NSD @{UB}and @{B}TD64@{UB}, @{B}Bigdisk @{UB}can not be used to create a single partition
bigger than 4 Gigabytes.

The  program  has  been tested and is known to work with the @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s scsi.device
and  z3scsi.device; and the @{B}Draco@{UB}'s dracoscsi.device. At the time of writing, it
did  not  work with @{B}Phase 5@{UB}'s cybscsi.device. Other devices may or may not work.
Fortunately,  a free demo is available which allows you to test the program with
your system.

To get the demo, ordering information or other details, visit the @{B}Arthur Wilkins
Software @{UB}website at: @{B}www.acomp.hu/awsw@{UB}

* Concerns, Cautions and Important Notes

Do not use a partition beyond 4 GB as a boot drive (SYS:).

Depending on the implementation, the @{B}Amiga @{UB}ROMs may need to access the hard disk
before  patches  have  been activated. After installing any of these patches, be
sure  to  reboot your computer before attempting to use any affected partitions.
Even  after  proper installation of any of these solutions, @{B}HDToolBox @{UB}still will
not  display  correct size information. However, it will configure the hard disk
properly.  If  you  know  what  you  are  doing,  you  can alternatively set the
partition  sizes  using  the  'Start Cyl', 'End Cyl' and/or 'Total Cyl' gadgets.
These  gadgets  provide  more  accurate  size control, than is possible with the
pointer  sliding  gadget.  Third  party  hard  disk  utilities such as @{B}Phase 5@{UB}'s
@{I}SCSIConfig @{UI}program, may work better.

To  be  sure  everything  is working correctly after installation, copy a lot of
files  to  any  @{B}AmigaDOS @{UB}partitions above 4 GB and then reboot the computer. If,
after  rebooting,  the  lowest partition is corrupted then your installation was
not  done  correctly  or  the  file  system  you  are  attempting  to use is not
compatible with your device.

You  should  not  use  @{B}Ami-Back  Tools@{UB},  @{B}DiskSalv@{UB},  @{B}Quarterback Tools@{UB}, @{B}ReOrg@{UB}, or
similar  repair  or  de-fragmentation utilities on partitions beyond 4 GB. These
programs will likely corrupt those partitions.

Only  use the @{B}AmigaDOS @{UB}@{I}Format @{UI}command with the QUICK option on partitions past 4
GB.  @{I}Format @{UI}knows nothing about working beyond 4 GB and it will probably corrupt
the  hard  disk.  It  is  important  to  note,  that  none  of these methods are
compatible  with each other. You can not just swap the new file systems back and
forth, without having to reformat the affected partitions. The @{B}TD64 @{UB}archive also
includes a patch for the @{B}AmigaDOS @{UB}@{I}Info @{UI}command, so that it knows how to properly
display  information about 4+ Gigabyte drives. It also seems to work for the @{B}NSD@{UB}
solution. too.

* Conclusion

The  @{B}Amiga @{UB} has  some  catching  up  to  do,  especially, when it comes to the 4
Gigabyte  barrier.  Hopefully, the new operating system, rumoured to be released
this  year,  will  address  this  and other problems properly. In the mean time,
these solutions are definitely a step in the right direction.

@{U}@{B}DAYTON COMPUTERFEST @{UB}- AN @{B}AMIGA @{UB}SHOW WITHIN A SHOW@{UU}

The  @{B}AmiTech  Dayton  Amiga  User  Group @{UB} has  made arrangements with the @{B}Dayton
Microcomputer  Association@{UB},  sponsor  of  the  @{B}Dayton  Computerfest@{UB}, the largest
computer show in this part of the country, to establish an @{B}Amiga @{UB}Area within the
show.   They   are  recruiting  @{B}Amiga @{UB} vendors,  developers,  user  groups,  and
individuals  that  wish  to  sell,  demonstrate,  or display @{B}Amiga @{UB}equipment and
capabilities to take part in the show.

The  show  will  be  August  27-29 at Hara Arena in Dayton, Ohio. The @{B}Amiga @{UB}Show
within  the Show, with a concentrated group of @{B}Amiga @{UB}vendors and displays all in
one place will provide are a number of advantages for the @{B}Amiga @{UB}user:
  * Access to a concentration of @{B}Amiga @{UB}gear, all in one place.
  * Availability  of  a  gigantic  source  of  general supplies, such as drives,
    printers, storage media, etc. at extremely attractive prices.
  * Very reasonable table prices.

Since this show normally has attendance of more than 30,000, it may also provide
the  @{B}Amiga @{UB} community an opportunity to make the public, as a whole, more aware.
@{B}AmiTech  Dayton @{UB} took  this  initiative  after the announcement that the @{B}Midwest
Amiga  Show @{UB} would  not  be  held  this  fall,  feeling  the  momentum that show
established  needed  to  be continued. There are lots of accommodations near the
show,  however, with a show this big it is best to make arrangements as early as
possible.

If  you  would  like  more  information  about  the  show or wish to participate
contact:

@{U}LETTER FROM @{B}AMIGA@{UB}'S NEW CTO, DR. @{I}RICK LEFAIVRE @{UI}@{UU}

Dear Amigans,

I  thought  it  would  be  appropriate for me to "introduce" myself to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community,  having joined the new @{B}Amiga @{UB}in April as chief technology officer and
senior  VP  of  R&D. Just as @{I}Jim Collas @{UI}is opening up communications channels as
our new CEO, I'll try to communicate as openly as I can about @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s technology
vision and directions.

First,  a  little  about  my  background, and why I'm at @{B}Amiga@{UB}. I wrote my first
computer  program  (on an @{B}IBM 1620@{UB}) in 1966, and got my first job as a (student)
programmer  in 1967. Over the past 32 years, I've been privileged to participate
in  the  evolution  of  computing  from the mainframe to the minicomputer to the
personal  computer  to  the  Internet. I started my career as a computer science
professor  doing  research  in  artificial intelligence and advanced programming
environments  (@{B}LISP@{UB}, @{B}SmallTalk@{UB}, and an @{B}AI @{UB}language I developed in the early 70's
called  @{B}FUZZY@{UB}).  I  moved  into  industrial R&D in 1978, and over the years have
directed  R&D  organizations  at  companies such as @{B}Tektronix@{UB}, @{B}Sun Microsystems@{UB},
@{B}Apple  Computer@{UB},  @{B}Silicon  Graphics @{UB} and @{B}Borland International @{UB}(now @{B}Inprise@{UB}). At
@{B}Apple@{UB},  where  I oversaw advanced technology R&D, we pioneered technologies such
as @{B}QuickTime@{UB}, @{B}PlainTalk@{UB}, @{B}QuickTime-VR@{UB}, and a host of other innovations that were
subsequently  copied  by  our friends at a large software company located in the
Northwest  corner  of the United States (sigh). We also provided funding for the
world's first Internet browser, and set up @{B}Apple@{UB}'s first Internet web site.

I spent most of my career as a @{B}UNIX @{UB}user and, later, a @{B}Macintosh @{UB}user. I managed
to avoid having to use @{B}Microsoft DOS @{UB}or @{B}Windows @{UB}prior to @{B}Windows 95@{UB}, but for the
past several years have had the, uh, "pleasure" of being a @{B}Windows 95/98 @{UB}user. I
must  confess that I have never been an @{B}Amiga @{UB}user, but I was well aware of what
was  going  on  in  the  @{B}Amiga @{UB} community  as  the @{B}Amiga @{UB}and @{B}Video Toaster @{UB}moved
multimedia  into  the  mainstream.  People  at @{B}Apple @{UB}had a great respect for the
@{B}Amiga@{UB},  and  the  communities always seemed similar to me. I am rapidly learning
more  about  the  spirit  of  innovation that has been at the heart of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community since the first @{B}Amiga @{UB}was shipped in the mid-80's.

Well, it is now 1999, and we find ourselves at the dawn of a new millennium, and
the  dawn  of  the  information  age.  The  personal computer, as represented by
@{B}Windows PC@{UB}'s and @{B}Macintoshes@{UB}, is now a mature product category, with little true
innovation  occurring  in the @{B}PC @{UB}industry. What's next? With the @{B}PC @{UB}industry now
in it's third decade, what will be the next big "S-curve" that will dominate the
next  20  years  of  computing?  Clearly,  it  will  involve the emerging global
information  infrastructure,  which  is creating a fundamental transformation of
business,  communications  and,  indeed,  human  culture.  In  many ways, we are
transitioning  from  the era of computing - building faster and faster computers
that  may,  incidentally,  be  networked  -  to  the era of communications, with
powerful  ubiquitous  communications  networks  that  connect  a wide variety of
computing devices.

We  at  @{B}Amiga @{UB} feel  that unleashing the full power of this emerging information
infrastructure  requires  much  more  than  a @{B}PC @{UB}with a browser plugged into the
Internet.  What  is  needed  is  a complete home computing environment that ties
together  powerful multimedia convergence computers with easy-to-use information
appliances, all transparently accessing content and services on the Internet. As
@{I}Jim @{UI} has told you, our vision and mission is to make computers a natural part of
everyday   life  by  creating  an  industry-standard  systems  architecture  and
operating  environment  for  this new world. In essence, we want to redefine the
home  computing  experience  for the 21st Century, combining awesome multimedia,
transparent  networking  and Internet access, and a user experience that makes a
computer or information appliance as easy to use as... a toaster!

It's  a  very  exciting  time  as the spirit of the @{B}Amiga @{UB}starts building again.
Personally,  I'm  thrilled to be a part of the new @{B}Amiga @{UB}team, working with @{I}Jim@{UI},
@{I}Petro@{UI},  @{I}Jeff  Schindler@{UI},  @{I}Allan Havemose@{UI}, and the other top people who are being
attracted  to this opportunity. I look forward to sharing more about our vision,
technologies and products in the months to come. Stay tuned...

@{I}Rick LeFaivre@{UI}
CTO and SVP, R&D
@{B}Amiga, Inc.@{UB}

@{U}@{B}IMAGEFX 4 @{UB}ANNOUNCED - NOW WITH ANIMATION!@{UU}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

@{B}Nova  Design, Inc.@{UB}, creators of the award winning @{B}ImageFX @{UB}package and the highly
received  @{B}Aladdin  4D  v5 @{UB}package, are excited to announce a brand new upgrade -
@{B}ImageFX  4@{UB}!  @{B}ImageFX @{UB} has  been  the required graphics application for all @{B}Amiga@{UB}
owners  and  has  been a part of @{B}Video Toaster/Flyer @{UB}owner's toolkits for years.
Combining  painting, image file format conversion, image processing, and special
effects,  @{B}ImageFX @{UB} remains the undisputed leader in graphics manipulation on the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}.

Now  in  its  fourth  major upgrade, @{B}ImageFX @{UB}goes animated! If you work on video
using  your  @{B}Amiga @{UB} or  want  to  work  on  animations for the Internet, the new
animation  controls  in @{B}ImageFX @{UB}are exactly what you've been wishing for on your
@{B}Amiga@{UB}. The animation system is as easy to use as the animation controls in @{B}Amiga@{UB}
paint  packages  but far more powerful and support full color animation, palette
mapped animation and greyscale animations as well.

@{I}@{B}ImageFX 4 @{UB}- the Animated Details@{UI}

@{B}Nova  Design, Inc. @{UB}has built on the new windowed interface introduced in @{B}ImageFX
3.x @{UB} and  has  added  controls to directly manipulate animations within @{B}ImageFX@{UB}.
Onscreen  VCR-style controls have been added to the layering system to allow you
to move within the frames of an animation or even playback the animation in your
preview  window.  Brushes  can be animated across a series of frames and effects
can be automatically processed across frames as well!

These  controls  make it easy to edit animations for use on the Internet on your
own  web  pages.  You can create hand drawn animations, brush animations and you
can  easily  rotoscope  video  sequences, add effects, and batch process. If you
want  to  modify  web  animations, it's as easy as loading now that you can load
animations.  Full  support for loading and saving entire or partial 'FlyerClips'
is included for @{B}Amiga Toaster/Flyer @{UB}owners.

Many  image  processing functions and effects have been updated to work directly
on frames and layers now. And what would a new upgrade of @{B}ImageFX @{UB}be without new
special effects? We don't know, since we've never released without including new
effects before and we're not going to do so now. We've got some cool new effects
in this release, so read on!

  * The  new 'Fireworks' effect can create amazing digital fireworks displays on
    your  images. The parameters for the effect are easily animated. 'Fireworks'
    uses  a  special-purpose particle system and can even use custom brushes for
    the  firework  'particles'  so  you  can  create everything from a realistic
    firework burst to a shower of coins!

  * 'Distorter'  is  the  answer  to  a  designer's  dream.  Similar  to the '3D
    Perspective Rotate' function, 'Distorter' can seemingly rotate your image in
    three  dimensions  but  with  no  constraints on how you move and adjust the
    image.  You  can  make  it stretch out at any corner or even twist it around
    itself. Amazing!

  * 'Blob'  is  a  fun, if digitally slimy, effect. With 'Blob' you can set your
    parameters to make a translucent colored ooze slide down your image. Looking
    to simulate the effect of slime? No problem with 'Blob'!

  * The  'Text  Generator'  has had so many improvements that it is like a whole
    new module. You can now use @{B}Postscript@{UB}(®) fonts with it in addition to @{B}Amiga@{UB}
    bitmap,  color, and outline fonts. You have more control over the fonts. The
    fonts  now can anti-alias for the best possible display. Best of all you now
    see  your  fonts  and text, exactly as they'll appear, on the display of the
    image in its own window!

@{I}CD the Light!@{UI}

@{B}ImageFX @{UB} now  comes  on CDROM for its standard distribution. If you don't have a
CDROM  drive  (and you should, they're pretty inexpensive now) @{B}ImageFX @{UB}will ship
with a coupon to order a copy on floppies. As a bonus the CDROM has sequences of
images, animations, and nearly the entire contents of our Internet site as well!

@{I}Ordering the Upgrade@{UI}

As  of  this release a new price structure is being implemented for upgrades. If
you  own  a  version  of  @{B}ImageFX @{UB}prior to version @{B}2.0 @{UB}your upgrade price is now
$149.95.  @{B}ImageFX 2.x @{UB}owners can upgrade for only $99.95. @{B}ImageFX 3.x @{UB}owners can
upgrade  to  @{B}ImageFX  4 @{UB} for  only  $79.95.  All  upgrades include the necessary
hardcopy documentation or upgrade documentation and CDROM.

You  can  order  via  1-800-IMAGE-69 in the US and Canada or call (804) 282-1157
elsewhere.  Orders can also be faxed to (804) 282-3768 or mailed to our address.
Anyone purchasing @{B}ImageFX 3.x @{UB}new after May 20th, 1999 can upgrade for free when
you mail us your dated proof of purchase with your upgrade request.

You'll  be  shipped @{B}ImageFX @{UB}and receive it in approximately four weeks depending
on  the  volume  of  preorders.  Previous  order  volumes have been high causing
delays, so order early!

@{B}ImageFX @{UB} is  also  available,  new,  through  your  favorite  @{B}Amiga @{UB} dealer at a
suggested retail price of $349.95.
