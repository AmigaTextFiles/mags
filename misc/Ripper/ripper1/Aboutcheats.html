Notice:

<font color =#4C4C4C>
Due to the large size of this text file(over 85k curently),
all future issues will be lharc'd and uuencoded for distribution.
My tests have shown a 50% savings in file size, thus saving
disk space on hundreds of sites, and quicker downloads for everyone
who gets this.

Description:
<font color =#4C4C4C>
This list contains cheats, hints, backdoors, helpful bugs, passwords,
codes, solves, and walkthrus for games on the Commodore Amiga computer.

If you use this list as a source for your own list or print any part
of this list in a newsletter(for a user group for example),
I only ask that you credit this list and its editor (ME).
<P>

DISCLAIMER:
<font color =#4C4C4C>
There is no way I can guarantee that all these cheats WORK as written.
A cheat/backdoor may work on the EUROPE release of a game and not the
USA release and vice-versa. Cheats/backdoors may or may not work across
versions/upgrades of the same game. They also may or may not work
on OTHER computers unless specifically listed as such(for the Atari ST,
as somebody asked me once.)
