THE BASICS
<font color =#4C4C4C>
<P>
        For those not familiar with AMOS, here is a brief introduction.
AMOS, written by Francois Lionet and sold by Europress, is a BASIC-like
language for the Amiga.  It includes many special commands that let you take
control of the Amiga's special capabilities.  The best part is that it is
very easy to learn and use.  With one command, you can have a sprite or BOB
flying across the screen.
<P>
        Unfortunately, official support for AMOS has stopped due to the
demise of Commodore.  There is a party of dedicated AMOS users, however,
that are looking for the rights to obtain the source code and continue
providing free PD upgrades.
<P>

REVIEW
<font color =#4C4C4C>
<P>
        The CD is organized into groups of directories that span the entire
AMOS PD collection.  Each APD disk is placed in its own subdirectory so that
you can just copy the contents of a directory onto a bootable floppy disk
and distribute it to your friends.  Even the C, S, L, DEVS, etc. directories
are there.
<P>
<font color =#00FFFF>
INSTALLATION
<P>
<font color =#4C4C4C>
        Simply place the CD into your CD-ROM drive.
<P>
<font color =#00FFFF>
CONTENTS
<font color =#4C4C4C>
<P>
        As mentioned earlier, the CD contains the entire AMOS PD Library
collection (#1 - 620).  The library is run by Len and Anne Tucker and is
endorsed by Europress.  There are over 33,000 files.  There are 1600 AMOS
source files, 100 sprite banks, 260 CTEXT/TURBO PLUS banks, 800 audio
samples, oodles of music banks, and a few PD extensions for AMOS and AMOS
Pro.  Program categories are Eurodemos (Digital Orgasm), utilities
(Adventure Toolkit), music (Maverick music disks), games (Super Battlezone),
and many others.
<P>
        Also included are a few of the TOTALLY AMOS disk magazines, also run
by Len and Anne Tucker.
<P>
<font color =#00FFFF>
LIKES
<font color =#4C4C4C>
<P>
        The best part of this CD is that it is so cheap and contains the
entire AMOS PD library!  If you use AMOS, this CD is a definite must.  The
source code is invaluable, and the banks are totally usable in your own
programs (as long as you comply with the author's wishes, if any).
<P>
<font color =#00FFFF>
DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS
<font color =#4C4C4C>
<P>
     It would have been nice also to provide an LHA archive of each disk
so it could be placed on a BBS and/or downloaded to the crappy MSDOS
machines I have at work.
<P>
<font color =#00FFFF>
COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS
<font color =#4C4C4C>
<P>
        The AMOS PD CD is just like the Aminet CD, except that it is geared
specifically toward AMOS users.  Even non-AMOS users may find a few nice
games, demos, and/or utilities that they like.
<P>
<font color =#00FFFF>
CONCLUSIONS
<font color =#4C4C4C>
<P>
 If you have AMOS, you MUST have this CD.  It is the PERFECT excuse
to tell your significant other that you need a CD ROM drive!  Hey, it worked
for me!
