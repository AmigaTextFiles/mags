<font color =#4C4C4C>
       Take on the never ending stream of hostile Xenomorphs in Team 17's
superior sequel. It's a Doom clone (yet another one!)in which you and play
Colonial Marines,Found floating in space, after the first game. You awake to hear
the Howling of the BREED Again you must destroy and maim.
the graphics are not that bad, but a fast CPU is needed.
as usual you are over run by aliens. Collect keys, ammunition and
credits which can be used to upgrade your weaponry in this game of blasting
and strategy that also features speech.

in the end not the most origional but worth having
