Another tip is to set the citizen's taxes to 0%.  Then just before tax
collection (December or November if playing at fast speed) quickly set the
taxes up to 20%.  Then after you collect taxes, put it back down to 0%.
This way the citizens think they are not paying any taxes.

bulldoze all the excess powerlines and you can build on the new land.

(hint#3,yet another way to make new land)
To MAKE land you simply make a 3 lane highway across any water source.
When you make a road by putting 3 sections of road on top of three section
of road on top of three sections of road (3 by 3) you make 1 section of
land in the middle.                WWWWW   WWWWW     To make more land, just
<P>                                WRRRW   WRRRW     move you roads over, or
           L= land                 WRRRW = WRLRW     make your roads 4 by 4,
           W= water                WRRRW   WRRRW     5 by 5 etc.  Play with
           R= road                LLRRRLL LLRRRLLL   it.  It'll work.
                                  LLLLLLL LLLLLLLL
