<H1><U>Summary:</U></H1>

<font color =#4C4C4C>
Another Doom type clone! or rather E.D 209 from Robocop.
This,like a lot of modern games, Runs From CD! AND HARD  DRIVE!
ONCE THE INSTALLER SCRIPT IS INSTALLED, Run from hard drive.
the intro sequence is rather cool. even if it was playd on a small screen
The game although rather repetitive Dose run well on a 030(+fast)
I had mine on almost FUll Screen!
the sound FX are prity ok, and the in game GFX are not ground breaking,
but not crap! A good romp and worth my jugment of 81%
