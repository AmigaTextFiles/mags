<P>
I have had the plesure of testing, using and now Owning the "EZ-Flyer" from SyQuest.
On first apperences the rather square shape is not bad looking. not exciting ither.
<P>
The cartridges are rather square in apperence, campaired to the ZIP and Hold 230MB on
a single cartridge. The speed test on sys info read the drive at:-1,129,931 Bytes
PerSecond.
<P>
The drive came with a scsi ID of 4(set as standard) to change that Just press the
power button on, with the drive empty, pressing the eject button. and it only has a
25 pin connecter at the back. I connected it with a 25-50(Centronics) to the back of
the CD ROM drive. and had no problems. And as it is Self terminated it also adds as a
bonus. Mounting can be tricky! I use SCSi Mounter with the tool types set for the
same device as the cd rom.
<P>
To mount from shell type scsi mounter d squirrelscsi.device U3 N
The D is for Device the U is the SCSI unit - YES! your right I did say it came with
an ID set to 4....I CHANGED IT!!! YOU would type 4!
<P>
It comes with a PSU and 1 Cartridge, PC FORMATED!!! To format it your self follow the
cartridge instructions that I have set out in this Mag!! at £130 (ISH) it is not that
bad an idea, What with flopy drives being used less and less!


I cant think of any more witty/informative things to tell you about this drive,
so if there are any questions<a href="contact.html">PHONE ME - STATIC -</A> <B></B>
