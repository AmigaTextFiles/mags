            On any clear night, look at the eerie starry sky and say, "who
am I? Why am I here? Is there anybody out there?" Humans have always felt
awe, fear and wonder for the infinite blackness os space, but as science has
replaced prehistoric religion, we have replaced the Ancient Ones with the
Alien Ones. And this superb tactical game of sci-fi combat and strategy from
Microprose sends you head-to-head against them.
<P>
     You play the commander of XCOM, an elite secret multi-national
sub-group of the United Nations. Various countries fund your work on the
rapidly increasing hostile alien activity. You must shoot down alien
spacecraft, kill or capture the surviving occupants and investigate any
equipment recovered. UFO is very successful on two distinct levels. The
first involves the building and managing bases around the world, developing
facilities and maintaining an effective military presence. What and where
you build is upto you, but failure to deal with alien incursions will mean a
reduction in funding from the country being bothered. Failure to offer
adequate protection may ultimately mean they sign a pact with the aliens,
further adding to your woes. Your base can comprise of several different
facility types including hangars, living quarters, stores, radar stations,
laboratories, workshops and alien containment units. They all cost money to
run and it may be necessary to supplement a bases running costs by selling
alien artifacts, equipment and tools.
<P>
     Employing scientists means you can research alien technology while
engineers can manufacture it. You can also perform autopsies on dead aliens,
interrogate live ones and bit by bit your understanding of their culture
will increase. Pretty soon you'll be throwing away your M16 rifles and Auto-
cannons in favour of power-armour, plasma guns and blaster launches. The
latter is a devastating smart-missile launcher and the pinnacle of alien
achievement.
<P>
     The other level of the game is more tactical. Once a spaceship has been
sighted and shot down you must despatch troops to investigate and kill the
survivors. Crash sites are the missions encountered most, but the same
multi-level 3D isometric perspective is used when your base is attacked, you
engage a "terror site" or you assault a secret enemy installation. Each
soldier has a rank based upon his experience, number of kills and previous
mission ratings. His or her ability to perform is affected by a number of
factors from morale to health, but mainly by the number of Time Units
available. These determine how many actions can be undertaken in a round of
combat. Actions such as walking, kneeling, aiming, shooting all take Time
Units and this makes the game very tactical.
<P>
     It's impossible to list all the features and options covered in this
comprehensive game. Graphically it's superb, the music and sound effects are
outstanding and there's a long sustained challenge with several levels of
difficulty. I can't recommend this title enough. If you like strategy, 3D
combat and tactical gameplay, you won't be disappointed. This must rate as
one of the best games in its genre.

Verdict: "Unreservedly recommended!"
