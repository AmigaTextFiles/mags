    A Boing 747 was making its approatch for a landing in seattle when an electrical
    fault ment all the plains equpiment was renderd usless. The pilot saw nothing but
    haze, Smog & Cloud UNTIL he saw a large Sky Scraper! So he circled this for about an
    hour, With a sine reading "Whare am I ?" on it. then he saw suddenly, A sine at one
    of the windows, which read "In an airplane!" the Pilot Thanked god, and looked at his
    map and plotted a corse to seattle airport. After he landed the plain the Co-pilot
    asked how he knew whare he was, And how He Landed?
    The Pilot looked at him and Said, "I knew we wer at the Microsoft building. as the
    answer was technically correct but compleatly crap and usless and crap!"

Now for a longish joke:
^^^ ^^^ ^ ^^^^^^^ ^^^^
<font color =#4C4C4C>
     A man walks into a newsagents to buy some lottery tickets. He buys his
tickets and comes home. He kisses them and chants "I've got to win, I've got
to win", and puts them in a safe place.
<font color =#FF0000>
Saturday night:
^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^
<font color =#4C4C4C>
     He sits in front of the telly with his tickets clenched in his hands.
He sits in agony watching as the first number is drawn. After all the balls
are drawn he checks his tickets to find that on one of them he gets all SIX!
He can't believe it! He then goes out and gets totally pissed out of his
head.
<font color =#FF0000>

^^^^^^
<font color =#4C4C4C>
     Gets even more pissed.
<font color =#FF0000>
Monday:
^^^^^^
<font color =#4C4C4C>
      Walks into the newsagents (still totally pissed out of his head) and
says: "Ere mate, I've won the lotteryyy. I've got all six numbers"

Shop assistant: "Well done. What you can do now is either get all your
money at once and do what you want with it, you can invest it or you can
get it in installments. This means that you'll get 1 million every year for
six years."

Bloke (totally confused by what he just said says): "Well look ere mate, if
your gonna piss me about then I want mi quid back!"
