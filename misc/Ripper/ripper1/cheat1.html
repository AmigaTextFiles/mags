--- Carrier Command ---
Pause the game and type 'THE BEST IS YET TO BE'.
The game restarts automatically, and  displays  ' Cheat Mode Activated '
in  the message panel.
Now, press the plus key on the numeric keypad.
The mantas and walrus' will be invulnerable except to crashing
(low altitude). Or try surrendering and press the + and - keys to cycle all
through all the objects in the game.
<P>
      When paused, pressing + and - on the numeric keypad toggles
Manta invincibility: the flying craft are no longer vulnerable to
aerial attack, although collision with large objects is still fatal.
Once a course has been programmed for the carrier, Mantas or
Walruses, engage autopilot and click on pause. To avoid sloggin
around inreal type, you will find that pressing 3 on the keypad and
unpausing again takes the corresponding craft directly to its
destination. Likewise, pausing and pressing 2 replaces lost
shielding, while tapping 1 refuels the craft in question.
9 shows the current difficulty level, 7 speeds up the game and
6 brings up the programmers' test palette!

<P>
A lot in this excellent simulation. PAUSE the game and type
GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME then press + on the numeric keypad for your
mantas and walruses to become shielded. Press - to disable.
<P>
Try pressing CTRL and M on the main screen for some interesting effects.

HINT: Try always to cut of the path to the homebase (top right island)  of
the enemy ship. It might get stuck without fuel and so buys you lot of time
to conquer a lot of islands.

--- Chamber of the Sci-Mutant Priestess ---
(quick solve)
You don't have to complete all five Ordeals. Instead, go into the
tunnels(from The Noose) and wait an hour. Then leave the tunnels and go to
The Master's Eye. Wait around until The Master dies. Search his body for

the egg.

--- Chaos Strikes Back (Dungeon Master II) ---
(cheat)
Find a dragon and cast MON ZO GOR SAR and hit ESC to pause the game. Hold
down the ALT key and type in LORD LIBRASULUS SMITHES THEE DOWN. Unpause
the game and slay the beast. He leaves behind a firestaff and your party
will be invincible.
<P>
Undocumented Spells:
GOR IR KU   - Detects Monsters
GOR IR ROS  - Detects fake walls and "invisible" (actually hard to see) pits
GOR IR DAIN - Detects "magic" on screen?
ZO IR NETA  - Anchors the map at the point of casting so that as you move
              around, the map view stays at the anchored position.
<P>
(hint #1)
It's _REALLY_ easy to kill _ANY_ dragon.  Here's how.
1) Prepare all your players with MON IR VEN spells (mega poison cloud)
2) Use the green freeze life box (on the dragon)
3) Cast the spells, and then double up on each player
   (ie. each player casts 2 spells for a total of 8)
4) Wait... dinner will be served soon.
<P>
(hint #2)
Using the Vorpal Blade:
If you don't have both Vorpal Blades, you can increase #hits/time by
passing the weapon back and forth between the two attacking players.
(ie.  hit -> pass blade to #2 -> hit -> pass back to #1 -> hit ->...
<P>
(hint #3)
Contrary to what I've read on the net, everything is affected by
fireballs, including knights and dragons.  The only exceptions are
slime, black flames, and the thing that pops up from the floor.

One can play easy mode and still access all the screens.
Here's what to do:
Select the hardest possible setting before starting the game,
this includes not only hard mode but also disabling that obnoxious
'flip screen' feature and choosing only three lives. Then click on the
'game' icon and do as if you were to start the game. When the
prompt bar says 'Click to play' instead choose the 'exit' icon and this
will bring you back to the startup menu. Now you can select the easy mode
and more lives and you will still be able to see all the screens assuming
you're deft of hand enough to get to them in easy mode. Hope this helps!

A couple of tips on Dragon Wars.....
<P>
If you do a "changetaskpri -1" beore running Dragon Wars, your Amiga
will continue to multi-task. It appears that DW busy-loops, or something
like that. Moving it to a lower priority works great. I have run downloads,
formatted disks, and played Dragon Wars, all at the same time.
<P>
If you press Amiga-E, you will see the game's ending sequence (it also
ends the game, so be sure to save it before pressing Amiga-e).
<P>

For a better character:
Create a new set of characters using procedure described in the manual, but
with the following changes. When you are asked for the first name, type
SUPERVISOR and press Return. Now enter a normal name and continue the
creation process. When you use this team of characters, the game works as
usual except that when you press F10, all wounds are healed and dead
characters are resurrected.
<P>
Info magazine says: When the program asks you for first character type
31415927, hit Return then type SUPERVISOR. Then give your character a name.
<P>
(hint)
All armor, treasure and weapons inside palaces are restocked every time you
enter. Send the strongest character in to grab the equipment, then
distribute it among your band. If you need some quick gold, do this
repeatedly, then go see the weaponsmith.
<P>
Get all the expirence points you want by going to Prince Haagkens castle.
Make your way past the bats, past the first fireplace with the trap to the
the second fireplace. In front of the fireplace is a switch that activates
a door two or three rooms farther on in the castle when you step on it.
This door leads to a water fountain. Looking into the fountain transports
you to a room filled with water that has a never ending supply of water
monsters. Take your best weapon and armour with you. Set your character
on 'auto kill' and if he or she is able to hang in there, you can leave
the character in the room for several hours or all night killing off
zillions of monsters. Do this for each of your characters and youll
easily be able to kill the giant dragon.
