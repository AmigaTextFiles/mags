<P>                             
                             

     The following names and addresses are the contacts that I swap PD
software with. They have given me permission to place their addresses in
this list or they have had their address printed in another contacts
database and I don`t think they`d mind (if you do then why did you advertise
in another contacts list?).
<P>
     All I ask is that you don`t send them a bomb or something stupid like
that as I don`t think they`d be too pleased! Also, please remember to say
that "Nick Abbott" advertised your address so I wrote to you. Another thing
that I ask is this list is ONLY for swapping PD software. DO NOT use this
list for sending people pirated software as I wont be apart of it. If I find
out then your name will be off the list. So be warned.
<P>
<centre>Well, on with the list:</centre>

<centre>    Ian doesn`t (as far as I know) have much PD (except for the disks that       </centre>
<centre>he got from me) and so doesn`t really swap PD software. He does however like     </centre>
<centre>writing to people so if your interested in talking Amiga then write him a        </centre>
<centre>letter. I`m sure he`ll be pleased to receive it.                                 </centre>
