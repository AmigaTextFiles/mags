<CENTER>PRODUCT BRIEF</CENTER
<CENTER>FOURTH-GENENERATION 32-BIT MICROPROCESSOR           </CENTER>
<P>

        The MC68060 is a Superscalar, high-performance,32-bit
microprocessor providing a low-power mode of operation. The MC68060 is
fully compatible with all previous members of the M68000 familly. The
MC68060 features dual on-chip caches, fully independent demand-paged memory
management units (MMUs) for both instructions and data, dual integer
execution pipelines, on-chip floating-point unit (FFU), and a branch target
cache. A high degree of instruction execution parallelism is achieved
through the use of a full internal Harvard architecture, multiple internal
buses, independent execution units, and dual instruction issue within the
instruction execution controller. Power management is also a key part of the
MC68060 architecture. The MC68060 offers a low-power mode of operation that
is accessed through the LPSTOP instruction, allowing for full power-down
capability. The MC68060 desing is fully static so that when circuits are
not in use, they do not draw power. Each unit can be disabled so that power
is used only when the unit is enabled and executing an instruction. Fig 1
illustrate a block diagram of the MC68060.
<P>
Complete code compatibility with the M68000 family allows the designer to
draw on existing code and past experience to bring product to market
quickly. There is also a broad base of established development tools,
including real-time kernels,operating systems,languages,and applications,to
assist in product design.The functionality provided by the MC68060 makes it
the ideal choice for a range of high-performance computing applications as
well as many portable applications that require low power and high
performance. The MC68060's high level of integration results in high
performance while reducing overall system power consumption.

<H1>INTEGER UNIT</H1>
<P>
The MC68060's integer unit carries out logical and arithmetic operations.
The integer unit contains an instruction fetch controller,an instruction
execution controller,and a branch target cache. The superscalar design of
the MC 68060 provides dual execution pipelines in the instruction execution
controller,providing simultaneous execution.
<P>
The superscalar operation of the integer unit can be disabled in
software,turnig off the second execution pipeline for debugging. Disabling
the superscalar operation also lowers power consumtion
<P>

                        <H1>INSTRUCTION FETCH CONTROLLER</H1>
<P>
The instruction fetch controller contains an instruction fetch pipeline and
the logic that interfaces to the branch target cache. The instruction fetch
pipeline consists of four stages,providing the ability to prefetch
instructions in advance of their actual use in the instruction execution
controller. The continuous fetching of instructions keeps the instruction
execution controller busy for the greatest possible performance. Every
instruction passes through each of the four stages before entering the
instruction execution controller. The four stages in the instruction fetch
pipeline are :
<P>
1. Instruction address calculation - The virtual address of the instruction is determined.
<P>
2. Instruction fetch - The instruction is fetched from memory.
<P>
3. Early Decode - The instruction is pre-decoded for pipeline control information.
<P>
4. Instuction buffer - The instruction and its pipeline control information
   are buffered until the integer execution pipeline is ready to process the instruction.
<P>
<H1>BRANCH TARGET CACHE</H1>
<P>
The branch target cache plays a major role in achieving the performance
levels of the MC68060. The concept of the branch target cache is to provide
a mechanism that allows the instruction fetch pipeline to detect and chage
the instruction stream before the change of flow affects the instruction
execution controller.
<P>
The branch target cache is examined for a valid branch entry after each
instruction fetch address is generated in the instruction fetch pipeline.
If a hit does not occur in the branch target cache, the instruction fetch
pipeline continues to fetch instructions sequentially. If a hit occurs in
the branch target cache, indicating a branch taken instruction, the current
instruction stream is discarded an a new instruction stream is fetched
starting at the location indicated by the branch target cache.
<P>
<H1>INSTRUCTION EXECUTION CONTROLLER</H1>
<P>
The instruction execution controller contains dual integer execution
pipelines,interface logic to the FPU, and control logic for data written to
the data cache and MMU. The superscalar desing of the dual integer
execution pipelines provide for simultaneous instruction execution,which
allows for processing more than one instruction during each machine clock
cycles. The net effect of this is a software invisible pipeline capable of
sustained execution rates of less than one machine clock cycle per
instruction for the M68000 instruction set.
<P>
The instruction execution controller's control logic pulls an instruction
pair from the instruction buffer every machine clock cycle,stopping only if
the instruction information is not available or if an integer execution
pipeline hold condition exists. The six stages in the dual integer
execution pipelines are :
<P>
1. Instuction Decode - the instruction is fully decoded.
2. Effective adress calculation - if the instruction calls for data from
   memory, the location of the data is calculated.
3. Effective address fetch - data is fetched from the memory location.
4. Integer execution - the data is manipulated during execution.
5. Data available - the result is available.
6. Write-Back - The resulting data is weritten back to on-chip caches or
   external memory.
<P>
The MC68060 is optimized for most integer instructions to execute in one
machine clock cycle. If during the instruction decode stage,the instruction
is determined to be a floating-point instruction, it will be passed to the
FPU after the effective address fetch stage. If data is to be written to
either the on-chip caches or external memory after instruction execution,
the write-back stage holds the data until memory is ready to receive it.
Temporarily holding data in the werit-back stage adds to the overall
performance of the MC68060 by not slowing down pipeline operations.
<P>
<H1>FLOATING-POINT UNIT</H1>
<P>
Floating-point is distinguished from integer math, wich deals only with
whole numbers and fixed decimal point locations. The IEEE-compatible
MC68060 FPU computes numeric calculations with a variable decimal point
location. The MC68060 features a built in FPU that is MC68040,MC68881/882
compatible. Consolidating this important function on-chip speeds up overall
processing and eliminates the interfacing overhead associated with external
accelerators. The MC68060's FPU operates in parallel with the integer unit.
The FPU can also be disabled in software to reduce system power
consumption.
<P>
<H1>FLOATING-POINT EMULATION</H1>
The MC68060 implements the most frequently used M68000 familly
floating-point instructis,data types, and data formats in hardware for the
highest performance. The remaining instructions are emulated in software
with the M68060 FPSP to provide complete IEEE compatibility. The M68060FPSP
provides the following features :
<P>
<Center>        o Arithmetic and transcendental instructions     </Center>
<Center>        o IEEE-compliant exception handlers              </Center>
<Center>        o Unimplemented data type and data format handlers</Center>
<P>
<H1>MEMORY MANAGEMENT UNITS</H1>
<P>
The MC68060 contains independent istruction and data MMUs. Each MMU
contains a cache memory called the address translation cache (ATC). The
full addressing range of the MC68060 is 4 Gbytes (4,294,967,296 bytes).
Even though most MC68060 systems implement a much smaller physical memory,
by using virtual memory techniques, the system can appear to have a full
4 Gbytes of physical memory available to each user program. Each MMU fully
supports demand-paged virtual-memory operating systems with either 4 or 8
Kbytes page sizes. Each MMU protects supervisor areas from accesses by user
programs and provides write protection on a page-by-page basis. For maximum
efficiency, each MMU operates in parrallel with other processor activities.
The MMUs can be disabled for emulator and debugging support.
<P>
<H1>ADDRESS TRANSLATION</H1>
<p>
The 64-entry, four-way, set-associative ATCs store recently used
logical-to-physical address translation information as page descriptors for
instruction and data accesses. Each MMU initiates address translation by
searching for a descriptor containing the address translation information
in the ATC. If the descriptor does not reside in the ATC, the MMU performs
external bus cycles through the bus controller to search the translation
tables in physical memory. After being located,the page descriptor is
loaded into the ATC, and the address is correctly translated for the acces.
<p>
<H1>INSTUCTION AND DATA CACHES</H1>
<p>
Studies have shown that typical programs spend much of their execution time
in a few main routines or tight loops. Earlier members of the M68000 family
took advantage of this locality-of-reference phenomenon to varying degrees.
The MC68060 takes further advantage of cache technology with its
two,independent,on chip physical caches, one for instruction and one for
data. The caches reduce the processor's external bus activity and increase
CPU throughput by lowering the effective memory acces time. For a typical
system desing, the large caches of the MC68060 yield a very high hit rate,
providing a substantial increase in system performance.
<p>
The autonomous nature of the caches allows instruction-stream fetches,
data-stream fetches, and external accesses to occur simultaneously with
instruction execution. For example, if the MC68060 requires both an
instruction access and an external peripheral access and if the instruction
is redident in the on-chip cache, the peripheral acces proceeds unimpeded
rather than being queued behind the instruction fetch. If a data operand is
also required and it is resident in the data cache, it can be accessed
without hindering either the instruction acces or the external peripheral
access. The parallelism inherent in the MC68060 also allows multiple
instructions that do not require any external accesses to execute
concurrently while the processor is performing an external access for a
previous instruction.
<p>
Each MC68060 cache is 8kbytes, accessed by physical addresses. The data
cache can be configured as write-through or deferred copyback on a page
basis. This choice allows for optimizing the system desing for high
performance if deferred copyback is used.
<p>
Cachability of data in each memory page is controlled by two bits in the
page descriptor., Cachable pages can be either write-through or copyback,
with no write-allocate for misses to write-through pages.
<p>
The MC68060 implements a four-entry write buffer that maximizes system
performance by decoupling the integer pipeline from the external system
bus. When needed, the write buffer allows the pipeline to generate writes
every clock cycle,even if the system bus runs at a slower speed than the
processor.
<p>
<H1>CACHE ORGANIZATION</H1>
<p>
The instruction and data caches are each organized as 4-way set
associative, with 16 byte lines. Each line of data has associated with it
an address tag and state information that shows the line's validity. In the
data cache, the state information indicates whether the line is invalid,
valid , or dirty.
<p>
<H1>CACHE COHERENCY</H1>
<p>
The Mc68060 has the ability to watch or snoop the external bus during
accesses by other bus masters, maintaining coherency between the MC68060's
caches and external memory systems. External bus cycles can be flagged on
the bus as snoopable or nonsnoopable. When an external cycle is marked as
snoopable, the bus snooper checks the caches and invalidates the matching
data. Although the integer execution units and the bus snooper circuit have
acces to the on-chip caches, the snooper has priority over the execution
units.
<p>
<H1>BUS CONTROLLER</H1>
<p>
The bus is implemented as a nonmultiplexed, fully synchronous protocol that
is clocked off the rising edge of the input clock. The bus controller
operates concurrently with all other fuctional units of the MC68060 to
maximize system throughput. The timing of the bus is fully configurable to
match external memory requirements.
<p>
<H1>IEEE 1149.1 TEST</H1>
<p>
To aid in system diagnostics, the MC68060 includes dedicated
user-accessible test logic that is fully compliant with the IEEE 1149.1
standard for boundary scan testability, often referred to as Joint Test
Action Group (JTAG).
<p>
<H1>POWER CONSUMPTION MANAGEMENT</H1>
<p>
The MC68060 is very power efficient due to the static logic and power
managment designed into the basic architecture. Each stage of the integer
unit pipelines and the FPU pipeline draws power only when an instruction is
executing, and the cache arrays draw power only when an access is made. The
FPU, secondary integer execution pipeline, branch target cache, and
instruction and data caches can be disabled to reduce overall power usage.
The 3.3-V power supply reduces current consumption by 40-60% over that of
microprocessors using a 5-V power supply.
<p>
The MC68060 has additional methods for dynamically controlling power
consumption during operation. Running a special LPSTOP instruction shuts
down the active circuits in the processor, halting instruction execution.
Power consumption in this standby mode is greatly reduced. Processing and
power consumption can be resumed by resetting the processor or by
generating an interrupt. The frequency of operation can be lowered to
reduce current consumption while the device is in LPSTOP mode.
<p>
                        PHYSICAL
The MC68060 will be available as 50 MHz and 66 MHz versions, with 3.3-V
supply voltage, and in ceramic PGA, and CQFP packaging configurations.
