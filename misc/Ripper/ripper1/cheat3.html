Fights - Proficent swordplay is essential if your to get anywhere in
the game. The neck chop is one of the more effective blows, but the
program blocks repetition of single moves. To get around this,
occassionaly switch to a differnt move in order to enable the neck chop
once again. Give generously to the poor and youll be a step closer to
obtaining the Sword of the Spheres.
<P>
The Palace - To enter the palace, youll need to get the invitation
from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala. Once you have it, keep out of
fights or you could lose it for good. When you get into the palace,
ask Nedrod three questions and he will give you the talisman, which
can help you find another useful item. Answer the Princess's question
with "Its a secret". She will give you the Ring of Belz, which will
only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.
<P>
In General - Objects are not always found in the same places from game
to game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is often in
order. To survive the final confrontation, a high psychic rating is
needed, which can be increased by donating skringles to the poor. Dis-
orderly conduct can have the opposite effect. The safest technique in
the space battles, is to slow right down as soon as you see the aliens
shoot them all, then power at full steam until the next lot. Follow
Readheads ship if you see it. Heatpro tablets are necessary if you
beam down to one of the hotter planets. Makes notes of what you are
told, and use any new names or subjects to weavel out every last bit
of information from the characters.

Just a few tips- When cruising the highway don't stop shooting,
and always choose the highest paid mission. Buy fuel carefully -
only enough for that level, after level 1 you MUST buy a
leanburner. Try to stay in the middle of the road and travel
fast, travelling slowly only burns more fuel. Fire bombs are more
useful than smart bombs when you learn how to use them.
Bulletproofing is necessary after level 2. When travelling
through the barriers the best speed is 90-120mph.

extra life and a 100,000 Bonus Gem once the Boss is defeated.

also grants you access to a magical secret room. When you reach the end of
the level, a silver door appears. `You don't have to fight the Boss.

Even more useful is how to create any color gem. The screen is split into
several invisible vertical stripes of color. When a gem falls, its color is

color of your choice.
