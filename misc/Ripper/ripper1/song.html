<font color =#4C4C4C>
            Songplayer does exactly what its name suggests. It plays various
sound formats, but not music formats. It isn't a replacement for
Delitracker, Eagleplayer or Hippoplayer, it's more of a sample player than
anything else. For a start it can only play sound formats in: IFF, 8SVX,
AIFF (8 or 16 bit), WAVE, AU and MPEG (layers I, II and III up to "Norm"
2.5).
<P>
     Now you're probably thinking "Why on earth should I review this?" Yes,
it's just a sound player like any other CLI programs like Play16 or
whatever. Why should this get special treatment? Well, Songplayer has some
quite ingenious aspects to it. The main one being the clever "Karaoke" mode.
<P>
     If, for example you wish to play an MPEG audio file that has lyrics,
you can upload a text file of those lyrics and assign times to each line
telling the program to change. I tried this out with the classic "Worm Song"
by Bjorne Lynne, with some satisfying results. A one line, resizeable window
pops up on your Workbench screen and displays one line of lyrics at a time.
As the program plays the sound file, it recognises at what times it needs to
change the lines and does so accordingly. Wether or not it has some real use
I don't know, but it's great fun!
<P>
     The Graphical User Interface also comes complete with adjustable sound
scopes. You can have various equalizers or spectrum analyzers pumping away
in time with the music. In this section you can also display a level-meter
to show how much processor work is being used (I assure you, it DOES get
used in abundance when playing MPEG files!). You can also adopt some mono
files to play back in "pseudo-stereo" mode.
<P>
     The archive comes complete with versions for all makes of Amiga with an
020 CPU or above. And of course depending on your CPU, the quality of the
playback is altered. A clever, novel little program.
