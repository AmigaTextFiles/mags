places: The turtle was programmed in asbestos, and

into the corner. Type in STONKER and re-enter the ship. Now pressing D
cycles through the available  weapons (including shield plus weapons), and
pressing C cycles through the levels.  NOTE: when entering a level, it's
always best to station the ship at the top left of the screen again, to
avoid  appearing at an illegal position, or even off-screen. On the
second level repeat the above process, getting the buggy back in the top
left hand corner, and retype STONKER again. It now enables the ship to fly
through walls, and pressing F while hovering over switches allows them to
be collected while in the air.

<P>
--- Globulous ---
The most important thing to remember is that ALL the puzzles can be
solved without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think its the
only way to solve the screen, look closely. Some of the puzzles get
pretty obscure after level 10, but once you eventually beat them youll
kick yourself for not seeing the solution earlier.
<P>
Look before you leap. Think about how the screen will look from a
flipped perspective. A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary and
waste time and switches if you dont.
<P>
Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen. It is
possible to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back up
or kill yourself, and the only way out is to press ESC and start the
whole game over.

into view mode which allows you to cycle thru all the aliens and all the
objects in the game. You also have complete mouse control over them-
you can make them rotate and zoom in and out by holding down the left
button and moving the mouse. To go to the next object hit the right
hand mouse button.
<P>
--- It Came From The Desert ---
Before attempting to go into the ants' nest, you should first save Elmer to
get more flamethrower fuel. Some time between the 8th and 10th (I don't
remember the exact day), he will leave a note in his station saying that
he is going hiking in the SW Volcanic Cone. Go to the volcano, fight the
ants, and next day, visit Elmer's station. He'll thank you for saving his
life and give you more flamethrower fuel.
<P>
The entrance to the ants' nest will never appear on the main map, but
there are several other ways to get there:

        - By taking a flight from Hilber's Field.

        - By driving a tank from a battle going on at a nearby location.

        - By going south when you are in a battle at the M1 mine.
<P>
The entrance to the nest doesn't stay open long enough for you to get in
before the ants start invading the various locations in the town, so you'll
have to wait until they do. The 11th is the best day to enter the hole since
it is very hot and there are few ants around. If you try cooler days,
there willprobably be too many of them around for you to handle. Also,
if you decide toget to the hole by plane, you can land safely on the dirt
road parallel to the tracks leading to the M1 mine.
