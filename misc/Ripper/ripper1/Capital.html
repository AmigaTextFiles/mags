Yet another beat 'em up graces the Amiga scene. WAIT! Before you groan
and quit this file, it really is a different beat 'em up.
<P>
In the same genre as Street Fighter II (remember that?) and Mortal Kombat 3,
but this beat 'em up has been made specifically for the Amiga.  It is not
some crappy Mega Drive conversion, which only has a few more colours.
<P>
Click BOOM have done very well making this game, and it includes some
features which are very original and are not present in other games of
this type.
<P>
There are a wide selection of fighters to choose from, but while we are
on the characters we have to mention one point that every reviewer seems
to mention, that is the female fighter DEMONA.  Now I don't know about you,
but I couldn't take a person who fights half naked seriously.  This is one
of the game's falls, it ruins the serious fighting atmosphere in a way,
maybe it would make a good comedy character in Viz 2 or something,
along with Johnny Fartpants, and Buster Gonad.
<P>
On the fighters there are six different warriors for you to choose, in
either two player (one to one) game, or against the computer in a level type
of game where you can get to the end of the game and see the ending (haven't
managed to get that far yet!).  One player that is crap is called Wakantanka
(have to be careful how you spell that!) he is so sloooowwww.
<P>
As the game is an AGA chip set only game the graphics all use 256 colours on
screen and has very smooth animation, and beautiful backgrounds.
<P>
The great 'features' that we were talking about before is when your energy
is very low (when you are almost dead), the game introduces a nice way of
finishing you off.  For example you may notice that a big wall of spikes
will burst out behind you, then all you need is one bash from your opponent
and you will go flying through the air and make a nice new wall paper called
hint of brain.
<P>
ClickBOOM have done very well in making this game, let's hope number 2 is on
the cards for release soon.
