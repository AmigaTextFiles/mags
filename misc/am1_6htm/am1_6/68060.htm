<P ALIGN="LEFT">I recently purchased the Blizzard 1260 Turbo Board manufactured 
by Phase 5 Digital Products. I ordered the accelerator from Select Solutions for 
$744.00, which was the best price I could find it for. I also got a 16mb SIMM at the 
same time. I was originally planning on ordering one of the 040 accelerators for my 
A1200 because I had read that there were fewer incompatibility problems with them, not 
to mention the fact that they cost much less. I called a few places and no one had the 
040's in stock, so I decided to go all out and get the 060. I'm honestly very happy that 
no 040's were available because the amount of incompatibilities I've come across are 
not worth mentioning. The Blizzard 1260 comes with a program called Cyberpatcher 
that allows programs that are looking for the older style math coprocessor to work 
perfectly with the 060. Most new programs work perfectly with the 060 and there are 
many patches available either from Aminet or directly from the software developer for 
the ones that don't.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One of the drawbacks of having an unaccelerated Amiga connected 
to a Multiscan monitor is that in the higher resolutions the screen updates slow down 
quite a bit. What I mean by this is that it takes the Amiga a long time to display the 
Icons, backdrops, and windows on the screen. Now that I have the 060 installed this is 
no longer a problem; regardless of the screenmode I choose, the updates are plenty 
fast. Here is a small list of games and productivity programs that I've found work 
perfectly with the 060: Capital Punishment, SlamTilt, Breathless (w/patch from Power 
Computing), Alien Breed 3DII, Final Writer 5.04, Final Calc, TermiteTCP, IBrowse, 
Dpaint IV AGA, Scenery Animator (w/Cyberpatcher), VistaLite3.00, and countless 
others. I cannot recommend this accelerator more highly, it seems expensive, but 
considering that your limitations are practically nonexistent, it's worth it.</P>
