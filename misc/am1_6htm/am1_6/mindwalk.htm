<P ALIGN="left"><B><I>Editor's Note: Due to time restrictions, we have decided to 
defer the next game review until the February 1997 issue. In addition, we felt that this 
reader's letter would prove interesting to those with a general interest in the history of 
Amiga gaming.</I></B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Thanks for your excellent coverage on Mind Walker in AM 1_5.  I 
just thought that readers who were interested in MW might like to check out other works 
by the same author: Bill Williams.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">His bizarre graphics/music and addictive (re)playability graced such 
8-bit classics as Alley Cat, Necromancer on Atari/C64.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, he was one of the few who kept on doing graphics, 
music, and coding all by himself, even with the increased workload of a 16/32-bit 
platform (which was Amiga, fortunately for us). As such, it takes only a few seconds to 
recognize his work; it is precious fresh air in these days of the faceless gaming 
world.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After MW, he went on to make "Sinbad and the Throne of the 
Falcon", "Pioneer Plague," and "Knights of the Crystallion" (his masterpiece,
IMHO), all on our favorite computer. The latter two titles are notable too, as HAM action 
games, a rarity even for today.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, I'm a big fan of his; in fact, MW was what pulled 
me into the wonderful Amiga world a whole decade ago :). I wonder what he is doing 
now...</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Thanks for that fascinating supplemental information. I didn't 
personally realize that Mind Walker was part of one programmer's long and respected 
legacy. It goes to show that the story of the Amiga is very many-faceted.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Also, if anybody knows the current whereabouts/activities of Mr. Bill 
Williams, we'd be interested in hearing about it; it's been many years since Mind 
Walker, but is its programmer still somewhere around the Amiga community?</P>
