<CENTER><H3>The Story</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Two alien species are at war for so long on their home planet 
that the planet is in danger of being destroyed. To remedy this, they decide 
to take their war elsewhere, and they pick Earth. Thing is, they are so small 
compared to Earth's inhabitants that their actions go unnoticed and they have no 
problem staging their battles.</P>

<CENTER><H3>The Game</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The game starts with the selection of your troops for battle. A 
commander can give you some hints and you can peruse a map of the battle area 
(often someone's back yard). Your troops are then beamed to the battle on a 
transport pad. There are two pads on each battleground: one is yours and the 
other is your enemies'. Once there, the troops are yours to control and are the 
tools you use to acheive the mission goal given to you by the commander during 
troop selection.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Commanding the troops is easy. You can select the troops in two 
ways. Either you can select a single troop by clicking on the troop with your mouse 
or you can drag-select a group of troops. After selection you click on the button 
of the action you want the selected troop to perform. The actions a troop can be 
given are to move, attack, defend, or return for repairs. If you move troops as a 
group by drag-selecting them, you are given the option of selecting from five 
formations for them to move in. If you select a single troop, you are given the status 
of that troop's damage on the lower right of the screen (handy for letting you know 
when to send a troop back for repairs). To deselect the troop or group, simply 
selecting another will do the trick. If move or attack are selected, you then click on 
the map to sent the troops on their way. A troop sent back for repair goes 
automatically back to the transport pad and beams himself back to the home planet. 
Troops automatically avoid terrain they cannot get past so it is not necessary to 
guide them every step of the way unless you want to. Sometimes troops can be a little 
thick in how to avoid things, so it can be important to keep an eye on them 
sometimes.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Startegy, however, is not as easy. Whatever troops you select are 
all you will have for the entire battle, and you often cannot take all of the troops 
available. To further complicate things, many, such as gliders and grenadiers, have 
different abilities and weapons. Selection of the troops must always be with the 
objective firmly in mind. Once in battle, you can face an enemy armed with not only 
its little army, but also pill boxes and tanks. So far, the only way I see to get a 
pill box for yourself is to take it over by killing the occupant and replacing him with 
your own. The missions tend to be fairly simple. Kill all the enemies, destroy the 
enemies' transport pad, that sort of thing. In all, it is important to both be adequately 
armed and to use non-conventional arms sparingly. Grenadiers do eventually run out 
of grenades and turn into normal troops, and some special abilities, like gliding, can 
only be used once, so planning out your plan of attack early in the battle can help keep 
a commander from ending up with the inability to reach the goal towards the end. In that 
event there is a convenient retreat button which can be employed.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">All in all, if you could get the hang of Cannon Fodder or 
Powermonger, you can easily get the hang of this game.</P>

<CENTER><H3>Bugs And Other Unforeseen Issues</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>

<UL>
<LI>Remember, in all this, I've only seen the pre-release. The released version 
of this game may be different in some ways.
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The only "bug" I have had contact with thus far is that once you give 
a group of troops a formation command, it is often hard to get them to stop. This has the 
effect of sometimes having them walk right into the line of fire.</P>


<BR><BR>


<CENTER><H3>Graphics, Sound, And General Multimedia Effects</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Graphics: The graphics in this game are very well done. The 
playfield is very well-detailed, and things like lawn ornaments add to the visual feel of 
the game. Nothing like shooting around a little elf figure at your enemies. The troops 
themselves are a nice size: not huge, but not too small. Through differences in their 
look, you can tell what the different troops are.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sound: Not much sound is in this game, but what is there has its 
place and is done perfectly. Your troops call out when selected, and when they are in a 
pill box, they sound just like they are talking to you on a radio. The explosions and 
shooting sounds are much like what you would hear in any other game of this type. All 
sounds add directly to the experience of this game.</P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">Overall, The visual and audio aspects of this game serve to drag 
you into the game. You know the scanario. It's 3:30 AM and you are saying "I wonder 
what the next level looks like" and "just one more, then I'll call it a night."</P>

<CENTER><H3>In Conclusion</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This game could easily be the next Worms on the Amiga, once 
released. It has that addictiveness that we love in a computer game. With the varying 
battlefields, troops, missions and enemies, you can easily play a game like this, if good, 
for days, and be well-satisfied that you spent your hard-earned money well. And this 
one is certainly done well. Not as complicated as a Settlers or Populous type of game, 
but not as simple as a Worms type of game, it is a nice mixture of strategy and action. I 
have a feeling we'll be hearing a lot from this game when it is released.</P>
