<CENTER><H3>The Story</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You are a parent bograt and you think you have just put your two 
young bograt children to bed with a story about the magic eggs that are held in 
the Mystical Castle of Bog. Meanwhile your children have decided to take a little 
adventure into the castle to retrieve the eggs. You have to get them and the eggs out 
of the castle.</P>

<CENTER><H3>The Game</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You accomplish your goal by controlling not the two children, but 
the parent bograt. Any bograt can pick up eggs and you can only exit each of the 60 
levels when both children are through the level and it is clear of all eggs. You 
accomplish this by employing levers, moving blocks and springs among other tools in 
each of the platform-type levels. On the levels you will find the bombs and keys you 
might need, with bombs only being able to be picked up by the parent for use in 
destroying some obstacles. That is the main extent of the violence in this game, as the 
focus is on solving the puzzle of each level to continue the game.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">To help the parent bograt, you have a map of each level that you 
can peruse at any time since levels can be much larger than the screen. The baby 
bograts are color-coded to show their differing talents. The red baby can pick up the 
keys and open doors while the blue one can shock the fungus creatures that try to hurt 
the babies. If a baby does get hurt, not to fret, it simply reappears at the nearest 
starting position. This is good since there are many hazards besides the fungus. 
There are plenty of traps to make your life difficult.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As in any good game, you can save and load your position and can 
control the sound effects and music.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you like platform puzzle games, this one is for you.</P>

<CENTER><H3>Graphics, Sound, And General Multimedia Effects</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Graphics: Good as any platform game. Certainly better than most. 
The characters are very imaginative and the backgrounds are well-detailed. The 
opening animation is cute, simple, quick, and easily fast-forwarded through. The 
animation is very smooth. Platform games can often jerk rather than scroll. This game 
has no problem in that respect.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sound: The music is nice and the sound effects are what you would 
expect from this type of game. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Overall, The graphics and sound are not cutting edge, but all in all, 
they are well-done. The animation and background really make for a good platform 
game, and this one has both.</P>


<BR><BR>


<CENTER><H3>In Conclusion</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This game can easily hold its own against most other platform 
games on any computer platform.</P>
