<H4><I>Sam falls victim to nostalgia, this time not for the Amiga, but for something 
hauntingly similar</I></H4>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some things don't seem to get better.  I have been having 
increasing attacks of nostalgia lately regarding Betamax.  As the remaining components 
in my once fine Beta systems gradually deteriorate and the inferior VHS format gets 
more and more use, I lament the reality that sometimes the best creations are doomed 
to just fade away. Instead of being nurtured and developed further, the poor ole Beta 
lost out in the corporate marketing wars and today is close to total extinction. It did more 
with less, and for a brief period was king of the hill, but that was not enough to prevent a 
less efficient format from becoming the standard that would prevail worldwide.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I will continue using my Betas as long as they hold up, and will 
continue to admire its superior design. And I will try not to show my anger when kids in 
chatrooms ask ............... "What's an Omega?".</P>
