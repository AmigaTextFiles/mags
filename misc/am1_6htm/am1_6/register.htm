<CENTER><H3>If you are interested in registering your site as an official mirror site of The Amiga 
Monitor, read on!</H3></CENTER>

Send EMail to 103165.3700@compuserve.com with "Register AM Mirror" as the subject, and specify 
the following information:
<UL>
<LI>A precise URL to be listed as the mirror site
<LI>An EMail address to which new issues of AM can be sent, and with which we can communicate 
with you
<LI>A short description of the site
<LI>The format(s) you will be carrying (HTML online, AmigaGuide online, HTML LhA, HTML ZIP, 
AmigaGuide LhA)
<LI>Whether you will keep archives of old issues available
<LI>A country or general geographic location of the server supplying your site
</UL>
That's it! If we register your site as an official mirror site, you get a listing in the mirrors.htm file that 
comes with every issue, and eventually on The Webb Site itself. Thank you for supporting The Amiga 
Monitor.
