<P ALIGN="LEFT">The following is a brief description of Amiga Fest '96 which took 
place November 29 through December 1. The Canadian Amiga show was produced 
jointly by Amazing 
Software and the people from Computer Fest. This material is by no means 
comprehensive and may not be 100% accurate. With that out of the way, here is my 
take on Amiga Fest '96.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Arriving at the show Friday, I found the Amiga section of Computer 
Fest (the main show of which Amiga Fest was a part) tucked away in the back corner of 
a giant warehouse. It seemed to have all the organization of a back yard barbeque, but 
there was definitely more here then met the eye.</P>

<CENTER><H3>QuikPak</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Their slogan "Now things are happening with the Amiga" was 
basically true. QuikPak introduced two new computers. The A5050 is a tower 4000 
computer with a Pentium CPU card, Zorro, PCI, and ISA slots. With a touch of a button, 
one can swap from the Amiga to the PC side. The prototype on display also had an 
LCD monitor built into the side of the tower. When flipped on its side the monitor flips 
out making it the world's largest portable computer. This was a "surprise" feature and 
would only be implemented if there was enough demand.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">QuikPak also introduced the A4060 L which was definitely a hit, at
least with me. It is basically a complete A4000 with an attached LCD monitor, keyboard, 
and 060 processor. The A4060 L was more compact than I imagined. This computer 
brings the dream of a portable Flyer system to reality. Now if someone would design a 
portable, hot-swappable, hard drive box, I'd be set. NewTek and QuikPak should get 
together on this one.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There was also great news that QuikPak is now the front runner for 
the purchase of Amiga technologies. This would make sense because they have a 
vested interest in the Amiga. They hoped to make an announcement "shortly."</P>

<CENTER><H3>NewTek</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Don Ballance was demonstrating the Flyer, and even though I own 
one and use one every day I was still struck by the simplicity and power of its 
interface.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It was also implied by a source that NewTek had no immediate 
plans to incorporate Firewire with the Flyer and that this was best left to third 
parties.</P>

<CENTER><H3>Phase 5</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Wolf Dietrich was showing off their Power PC/'060 board. For 
demonstration purposes Wolf played an MPEG movie in one window while in another 
window he used a fractal generating program. As Wolf zoomed in and out of the fractals 
the Power PC chip recalculated and re-drew the fractal in real-time. The MPEG movie 
being played by the '060 side never missed a beat (can you say dual processing?). Wolf 
went on to say that the board would be 10 to 20 times faster than an '060 and 
significantly faster than a Mac running an equivalent chip.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On a side note, Phase 5 is talking to NewTek about possible ports 
to their Power PC board. When asked if the Power PC board would run Windows NT for
the Power PC chip, Wolf replied in a Schwarzenegger accent, "We won't be getting into 
that; our main concern is Power PC Amiga." He did imply that if someone wanted to get 
Windows NT up and running on their board he would not stop them.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Wolf also went over the specs for Phase 5's proposed A/Box 
machine. The A/Box will run an Amiga OS 3.1-compatible operating system. It will also 
run Unix and Linux, in windows directly from the Amiga-compatible operating 
system.</P>

<CENTER><H3>Asimware</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Asimware displayed their Audio Thunder software along with their 
CD recording software and a 100 disc CD-R machine.</P>

<CENTER><H3>Applied Magic</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Applied Magic demonstrated their very impressive Broadcaster Elite 
non-linear editor. The quality of their digitized video was excellent. This company's lack 
of advertising makes me wonder if they are just biding their time until the PC port of 
Broadcaster Elite comes out.</P>

<CENTER><H3>Anti-Gravity</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Anti-Gravity products were on hand along with their President Dan 
Lutz. While I was videotaping the A5050T, Dan tapped me on the shoulder and asked 
me to take a look at a computer in his booth. Lo and behold it was a 200MHz DEC 
Alpha machine running Photogenics in a window right out of Windows NT. This, of 
course, was due to the fact that the machine was running a new version of the Siamese 
System by Hi-Q. If parts of Amiga OS were to be ported to the DEC Alpha there would 
be great possibilities here. I was informed that this was exactly what was happening 
and that the Amiga Math Libraries would be the first to be ported!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On a side note, Dan Lutz is a knowledgeable Amiga enthusiast. I 
listened to him turn several Amiga nay-sayers back on to the Amiga.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In conclusion I would have to say anytime you get the hottest 
developers together at a show, it is a success. Most developers, retailers, and many
end users know each other on a first name basis - and it showed. Developers, retailers, 
and users expressed their interests, ideas and hopes to each other. The Amiga 
community is a unique one and definitely worth saving. To coin a phrase, the results of 
the Amiga's death have been greatly exaggerated.</P>
