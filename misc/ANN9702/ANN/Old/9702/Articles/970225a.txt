If they can stick to that, it won't be unreasonable. But keep in mind
that timing is everything. If they had it last year, heads would turn.
Later this year, maybe something of note. Next year, faster machines
will be commonplace, and they won't look as good. And the UNIX market
is crowded, they need to stand out relative to SGI, DEC, Sun, and HP,
not simply the PClone or the Mac Clone.

It depends on price vs. features, not features on some absolute scale.
A 200HP engine in a $30,000 car is ho-hum, but in a $10,000 car it
rocks. Same principles apply in the computer business. As for Wow!,
the simple use of the BeOS or pOS will provide quite a bit of that,
since you'll get about twice the performance, versus Windows, on
multimedia-related software, user interface responsiveness, etc. Wow!
is ultimately an opinion based on the perception of the machine, not
the study of a set of specs.

Which is what? Be sold quite a few BeBoxen, considering they only sold
them to developers (eg, compare the number of boxes sold to the number
of developers). The machine is expensive, not ridiculously, but enough
to make it something of a problem, had it gone out commercially. But
it's a great machine, and apparently in demand now that Be pulled the
plug. And Be's decision had little to do with the BeBox per se, and
quite a bit to do with Be's corporate direction.

The problem with the A\Box is that it's likely to suffer from
AAA-itis. It's not outlandish for a chip development project to run
twice the forcast budget, and that's not to mention the complete
system design from scratch, which is what Phase 5 is doing. Sure, you
have to be ambitious, and they have more money and people to apply to
the project than PIOS does. Too much ambition has killed more
companies than you can shake a stick at, so let's hope for the sake of
the industry they get lucky and don't fall into any of the AAA traps.
