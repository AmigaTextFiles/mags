It's *currently* the only possibility. I can imagine having it a bit
more optimised to its host machine, of course. Anyway, if I watch
people here, they want 100 % binary compatibility, and then the *only*
way to achieve this is indeed emulation. UAE is already here, and on
this basis you can think about some improvements, but not magnitudes
of them.

BeOS will be the first OS running on the PIOS ONE, and there exists
a UAE port for it, though it's one of the slower ones. That will be
among the first items to test.
