Hi there,

Thought you all might like a few teasers on a new Amiga to be released SOON!!

And no, its not the ABox!

Rough idea on specs as follows:

Full tower case.
7 x Zorro slots
PCI slots.
2 x video slots.
64 bit 3D graphics card - video in workbench capabilities.
060 processor, possibly with new "booster" card, accelerated beyond
capabilities of P200 Pro!!
1 Gig HD
22Mb RAM
8 x CD ROM drive.
Monitor.
16 bit stereo sound output.

World preview at the World of Amiga Show - UK, May 1997.

-------------------------
The price should be at most a 1000 ukp. Phil Ayres writes that he will be
working with one within 4 weeks. It is not Quikpack who is the producer.
Unfortunately Phil will not reveal more. Join the Pure Amiga mailing list, to
get the latest.
