I caught wind that it is an 030 1200 style thing with a built in LCD screen.
It will supposedly have a wide SCSI 2 port and be around $1000. Now don't 
go quoting me, but thats what I got from someone at QuikPak. Can't reach 
anyone there by voice lately to confirm things though. Supposedly won't be
released unless they get ownership of Amiga.
