Only datatypes are used to display docks now.  This really really
really sucks. :(  What a major step backwards for ToolManager.
You can use an icon datatype, sure.  But you will only *ever* get the
unselected image.  So basically if you use an icon as a dock, it
*will* *NOT* *ANIMATE!!!*

Forget that.  Until icon support for docks is re-established, I am
going to stick with the wonderful version 2.1.  I don't understand how
someone can remove features from a program and then release it as a
new, better version.  Admittedly, the prefs interface is better.  But
it is controlling a program with less features.

What on earth am I going to do with 3.0?  All my docks are NewIcons.
They look spectacular on my Workbench.  So, what am I going to do with
3.0?  Not use it, unfortunately.

Please please PLEASE add one of 3 things to ToolManager 3.0.
1. Put the old icon code back in.  It worked perfectly with newicons and
normal icons.

2. Write an icon datatype that will return the unselected and selected
images of an icon seperately.  Then have the program use these 2
seperate images as the unselected and selected images in a toolmanager
dock.  And it must work fine with both regular icons and newicons.
Plus, it must also be automatic...just like the old Toolmanager was.

3. Write a datatype that will parse an icon (regular or new) as an anim.

There is a huge pool of NewIcon docks for Toolmanager, and basically
you just threw them all out the window with this new version.

I would love to use toolmanager 3.0, but I am not going to manually
convert every newicon I have over to an animation file.  First of all,
that takes up space on my hard drive to store animations that already
exist as icons.  Second of all, life is too damn short!!!

Thanks,
Josh
