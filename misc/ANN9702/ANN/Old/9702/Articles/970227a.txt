Subject ........: BLUE BYTE supports Amiga again !!!

Hi Amiga-Programmers,


First, this is *NO* fake !!!



I asked Erik Simon of "Blue Byte" about Amiga versions of the great
Games

 ALBION and BATTLE ISLE 2.

And what did he say:  YES !!!


Let me explain:


The idea is very easy:

Today there are many and good newcomer programmers in the Amiga scene
which really did great games. I think on games like , "Capital
Punishment",
"Nemac 4", "Breathless", "Breed 96", "Trapped" or the coming "Scions" or 
"BattleCraft" and so on.

All of them make the games without financial support of anybody. They
only can hope that they find a good distributor and that their games
will sell at least in some hundred units.

Or think on the companies like Vulcan that do all to keep the Amiga
alive.

So I thought: Why not converting an existing game for Amiga ?!
No need to develop a concept first, all graphics are even drawn (for the
PC-version)
and nearly no need for advertising (because the games are even
well-known).

The "only" work to do is to code the games.


Now to the facts:


If there is a programmers team that wants to convert a Blue Byte game
then please contact me (or better Erik) now !

But: you can *not* get any financial support of Blue Byte; but if the
game
sells well you will get your part of the profit of course (exactly the
same as
when you had coded an own game ...).
This means: the better you make the game and the better it sells (and
believe
me, these really long awaited games *will* sell ...) the more money you
will
get of the sales. If you make a shitty game - you will get nothing (but
that's
life).

I think this is a really great chance to give the Amiga community two of
the most wanted games (maybe this is expandable for newer games and more
companies ...).


But hey: if you now say you want to do this then please think of the
amount
of time and work such a project needs ... please only make it if you
really think you *can* do it !!!



And:
if someone of you knows addresses of engaged programmers (especially
the ones I mentioned the games of), please mail them this letter !



This chance won't come twice !!!




bye
Andreas



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

P.S.:

Some days ago I also got a mail from Westwood Studios.
Yes, they also think that this method can be a good idea !

This means :
If you want to convert LANDS OF LORE, KYRANDIA 2 or 3 or COMMAND &
CONQUER
contact me and/or Westwood - maybe you get the job.


And: I'm still waiting for mails from SSI, MicroProse and LucasArts ...

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




Very important:

On 17th March 1997 I will start a period of practical work for 20 weeks
and I
won't be able to answer e-mails in this time !!! Please contact only the
companies and *not* me in this time !!!
