Hi everybody

News from PIOS from 19.2.97


   PIOS ONE: The Hardware
PIOS Computer AG
News about the hardware of the PIOS ONE
There is a new chip called Hydra, which adds some
functionality to PowerPC systems:
  SCSI-2 host adaptor
  CHRP compatibility
  additional serial interfaces
  several control tasks on the mainboard, thus replacing other control chips
With the Hydra chip, the system diagram can already show a bit more,
see below.
Here already an image of the backplane with its interfaces in the
form factor of the ATX casing standard. The external SCSI-2 connector
is still optional:
Hardware of the PIOS ONE
The hardware impresses by its
modular concept, which drives the performance to new heights
thanks to newest RISC technology. But it still allows for a
priceworthy entry level, so that everyone can join the PowerPC world
without being excluded from being able to upgrade to workstation niveau.
The base configuration consists of two boards, the motherboard
and the CPU module, plus peripherals like drives, casing, and
power supply.
The motherboard contains the basic elements of the computer, the
three PCI and ISA slots, as well as the audio part and all I/O,
everything in proven standard technology, as it's used reliably and
at low expenses in industry standard computers. Graphics is provided
by a PCI-bus card.
The CPU module is plugged on the motherboard, and it contains
besides the CPU chip also the system RAM  (in standard DIMM sockets)
and cache RAM (also socketed, COAST standard, optional) as well as the
control circuitry for all this.
This way, maximum performance is assured also with faster
CPUs. CPUs of the PowerPC 603 family are used, they can be
shipped with clock frequencies of currently 133 to 200 MHz.
In the future, also CPU modules with more CPUs for multiprocessor
operation, with other CPUs from the PPC family, and with higher
clock rates are possible.
Details, Specifications
Motherboard
 diverse glue logic and control chips
 Input/Output:

     SCSI-2 for harddisks and CD-ROM
     EIDE for harddisks and CD-ROM (4 drives)
     floppy 1.44 MB
     bidirectional parallel interface
     2 serial interfaces RS-232
     2 serial interfaces RS-422
     provision for serial IrDA interface (infrared remote control)
     mouse and keyboard in PC standard on serial interfaces
     2 x PC-style game port
     2 x USB (Universal Serial Bus)
     16-Bit audio onboard, In and Out

 3 PCI bus slots, one occupied with PC-style graphics card
 3 ISA bus slots
 1 sound slot at the sound chip AD 1815
 board complies with ATX standard form factor
CPU Module
 CPU chip from the PPC 603 family, currently with 133 to 200 MHz
 2 DIMM sockets for system RAM
 1 COAST socket for cache (optional)
 controller chip(s) for RAM, PCI bus and cache (currently Motorola 105)
The interface to the mainboard is designed in a way, so that in future
also CPU modules with several CPUs for symmetric multiprocessing are
possible.
Case and Peripherals
 ATX standard case with power supply
 mouse: serial, PC standard version
 keyboard: serial, PC standard version or Windows version
Speeds
The CPU Module currently runs at 66 MHz clock frequency. As it also
contains the System RAM, also this operates at full speed.
Generally the RAM can be accessed always at maximum possible speed,
as fast as CPU, the control chip, and the RAM parts allow it,
because there's no dependancy on other system components.
This way the performance of the complete system can be increased
practically unlimited just by upgrading the CPU Module.
The Mainboard runs at the PCI standard clock frequency of 33 MHz.
No RISC, no fun! Says PIOS.
