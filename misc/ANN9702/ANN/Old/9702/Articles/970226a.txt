Subject ........: QuikPak's 4040L and 4060L ads

I just bought the March 1997 issue of Amazing Computing, and I opened
it up.  There's a big ad from QuikPak, showing their new portable Amiga
models, the 4040L and 4060L.  The picture has a major case of the jaggies
(please don't tell me this ad was made on an Amiga, or I'll cry) but the
worst news is the screen contents.  It's an absolutely outrageous insult
that must have taken mind-boggling incompetence to perform.  What does
it show?  Well, I noticed that QuikPak's web page seems to have the same
error, so go take a look at it:

    http://www.amigasupport.com/quikpak/products/a4060l.html

LOOK AT THE SCREENSHOT!  What is this 4060L running?

Whoever is responsible for this ad really needs to get a clue and a new job.
