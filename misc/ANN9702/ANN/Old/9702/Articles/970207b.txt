Subject ........: Amiga in Industry

Hi Everyone,

Several months ago my users group had presentations by two former C=
marketing executives.  They brought in various documentation about some
of the products that were used in Industry that were based on the Amiga.

I took notes, but couldn't find them later.  Well, they have been
found.  The notes were sparce, but here it is:

Telemetry at NASA - A single sale of $40 million.

Colorvision at Color Tile - Color matching for decorating, I guess.

Ultramark 9 - Vascular Duplex System (A3000).

Battle Tech Center Arcade System.

Postal Buddy - I think this was some kind of Post Office vending
machine.  My notes 	       just say "merchandizing".

Milking 1600 cows mechanically from one Amiga.

Industrial ram card tester.

The first ever teleconferencing was done on Amiga's.

Airport Systems - I believe that virtually all airports in the US used
this.  I seem to 		  remember that this is the screens that display
arrivals and 		  	  departures.

Atari game machines are Amiga based

Police gun traiing with light beams are Amiga's.

That's all I have, but one of these two people took over 90 Amiga based
products to market.

They did a good job, but could have done much better if C= would have
let them.  C= was constantly throwing wrench's into their work. 
Surprise, surprise.
