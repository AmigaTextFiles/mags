The BeOS, which is included, comes with net stuff, including a good
browser.

It uses a graphics card. You can choose to buy a "bare bones" model
where you supply all the drives and a graphics card or a fully
configured model. For the selection of the graphics card, you have
to watch, for which cards there are already drivers existing, a list
is available on www.be.com.

Well, this is of course also needed, but the emphasis is currently
on graphics, audio, animation applications, i.e. multimedia.
