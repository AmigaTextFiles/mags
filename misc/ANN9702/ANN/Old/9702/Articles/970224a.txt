I own an Amiga. I designed them for eight years. I learned a bit over
those years, stuff you don't have in Amigas yet. The PIOS One is the
direction we were heading with the Amiga when Commodore died. As of
today, no one can make a new Amiga. Some of us are taking what we
learned into the next generation.
