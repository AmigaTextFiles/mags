@{FG Shine}Welcome to @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 9th issue of @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}.

I  don't  remember  a  month  with so many pieces of news! Let me count the most
important  ones:  the changes of position in Amiga Inc., the release of features
for  the  Amiga  OS  3.5, the announcement of Java 2 for Amiga (Daytona) and the
Phase 5's impressive development of a new PowerPC accelerator.

If  you  read  the  editorial  of the last issue perhaps you remember that I was
telling  you  "the  Gateway  people  are  quite  pissed nowadays with Amiga Inc.
delays".  Well,  this  rumour  has  been  finally confirmed with the decision of
Gateway:  Jim  Collas, a senior vicepresident of Gateway is now the president of
Amiga.  This means that (finally) Amiga has the full support of Gateway, and the
parent company has been the responsible of the delays (and everybody was blaming
Jeff).

This  move has got several consequences: Amiga Inc. has moved to San Diego, near
Silicon  Valley,  and finally they are looking for people to work in AmigaSoft 4
and 5. So, if you are interested, perhaps you could apply.

And  what tabout the OS3.5? Now it is confirmed that Haage&Partner and Petro has
taken  the  control  of  its  development, and although the RTG and RTA has been
removed  form  the  list of features, they are doing their best. And this update
could not be the last revision of the Amiga OS.

There  is  a  technology  with was missing in this great OS: Java. There is some
efforts,  like  Kaffe,  but  Holger  Kruse  (author  of Miami) has announced the
development  of  Daytona,  finally  Java 2 for Amiga... and free of charge, both
for users and developers.

And last, but not least, the big surprise of the month. If you read usually this
editorial,  you  already  know my worries abouth the silence of Phase 5. I would
bet  they  were  leaving  the  Amiga  World,  but  fortunately I was wrong. This
Cyberstorm G3/G4 is the dream of every Amiga owner.

Anyway  I  see two big problems: they need 1,000 preorder (which is not going to
be  easy to get), and the time frame. A release for the end of the year could be
too  late.  There  are  people who want/need the PowerPC power now (e.g. me ;-))
and  I  can  wait  for so  long. Other people have PowerUp cards, and taken into
account  the  small  size  of the market, it is not going to be easy to sell the
CyberstormPPC/CybervisionPPC in the second hand market.

@node not03 "THE DEVELOPMENT OF LUNATIC ISLES HAS BEEN CANCELLED"

THE DEVELOPMENT OF @{B}LUNATIC ISLES @{UB}HAS BEEN CANCELLED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@{B}Sanios  Software @{UB} is  a  new  development  team for @{B}Amiga @{UB}which intended to port
several  games  to  the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. One of them was @{B}Guts'n'Garters in DNA Danger@{UB}, but
@{B}Ocean Software @{UB}has finally denied its conversion to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

Something  similar  has  happened  with  @{B}Lunatic  Isles@{UB},  a children's isometric
platform game. They succeed in licensing this game, but its development has been
cancelled due to a complete lack of support for the project. It seems that there
is absolutely no support in the @{B}Amiga @{UB}market for a game of this type.

Anyway, @{B}Sanios @{UB}have gone ahead and started to create their own game from scratch
entitled  @{B}Mage  Wars@{UB}. It brings those old "Dungeon and Dragon&quot games back to
life, incorporating @{B}AGA @{UB}graphics with a real time or turn based engine (actually
you choose how you want to play).

In  this game, as a Mage (sometimes known as a wizard) you will have to traverse
a  vast  land-scape on your quest and gain experience and power as you go along.
There  are  hundreds  of  unique items to be found that will both aid and hinder
your  quest.  Magic  Spells  by  the  bucket  load and plenty of interesting and
dangerous  characters.  The  graphics  are being done by the people behind @{B}Sixth
Sense  Investigations@{UB},  so  @{B}Mage  Wars @{UB} could  be a hit amongst the role playing
comunity.  One  of  the  many  features  included in @{B}Mage Wars @{UB}is the ability to
create  your  own  character from scratch. It will be possible to elaborate your
own  history  and  to  include your own graphics and sound. @{B}Mage Wars @{UB}is due for
release late this year.

On  the  other  hand,  @{B}Sanios @{UB} are  looking  for creative ideas to go into their
current  and  future  games.  If you have a story line or some neat features you
feel  could  work  in their games you can drop a line by mailing @{I}Dan Stephens @{UI}at
@{I}dans@ion.com.au@{UI}.

Also, they are currently looking for a WebMaster and a 3D programmer. If you are
interested  in  this, e-mail @{I}Dan @{UI}at the same adress. For more information, visit
the @{B}Sanios Software @{UB}site at @{B}sanios.ion.tm@{UB}.

@{B}AMIGA @{UB}ANNOUNCES NEW PRESIDENT AND FAST-TRACK DEVELOPMENT PLANS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SAN  DIEGO,  Calif.  - February 26, 1999 - In a series of meetings in San Diego,
representatives  of  @{B}Amiga  Inc. @{UB} and  @{B}Amiga International @{UB}met to hammer out the
details of technical, strategic and marketing plans which will see the launch of
a  range  of  new @{B}Amiga@{UB}-based computers for the next millennium. The company has
relocated  its  headquarters  to San Diego and @{I}Jim Collas @{UI}will be serving as the
new president of @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

@{I}"@{B}Amiga @{UB} is  an  amazing  opportunity  that we must act on now or it will be lost
forever," @{UI} said  @{I}Collas@{UI}.  @{I}"The  @{B}Amiga@{UB}®  platform  is  ideal  for Internet-ready,
consumer-oriented digital appliances of the future. The @{B}Amiga @{UB}name is associated
the  world  over  with user-friendly, low cost, powerful computing. We will take
this  philosophy  into  the  next  generation,  enabling products from hand held
Internet  appliances  to  high-end  graphics computers that help the user rather
than frustrate them."@{UI}

@{I}Collas@{UI},  formerly  a  senior vice president for @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s parent company, @{B}Gateway@{UB},
will  be  running  @{B}Amiga @{UB} as  a wholly independent subsidiary operation and will
integrate  @{B}Amiga  Inc. @{UB} and  @{B}Amiga  International @{UB} under the new @{B}Amiga @{UB}corporate
structure.  His  leadership  will  allow  the  company to step up a fast - track
development program that is currently underway.

@{B}Amiga @{UB} is  planning  to launch next generation products worldwide before the New
Year.  They will be announcing detailed product plans and introducing several of
their  strategic  partners  over the summer. Products currently targeted for the
initial  launch  are a development system, an Internet appliance, and a low cost
home  computer  in the tradition of the @{B}Amiga A500 @{UB}that dominated home computing
in the late eighties and early nineties. The developers system will be available
with a software development suite for low cost development on the new platform.

@{I}Jeff  Schindler@{UI},  in  charge  of product strategy for @{B}Amiga@{UB}, is planning the new
@{B}Amiga @{UB} product  line. @{I}"The @{B}Amiga @{UB}community has been doing incredible things on a
platform  which  hasn't  had an official update in eight years," @{UI}said @{I}Schindler@{UI}.
@{I}"They deserve a system which lets them show off their talents."@{UI}

@{B}Amiga@{UB}'s  administrative  center  in  San Diego will shortly be complemented by a
software  development  center  under  the leadership of Dr. @{I}Allan Havemose@{UI}, vice
president  of Engineering for @{B}Amiga@{UB}, in San Jose, California. The Silicon Valley
team  will  be  rapidly expanded over the coming months to develop revolutionary
@{B}Amiga @{UB} multimedia  layers  over the real-time @{B}Neutrino OS @{UB}core from @{B}QNX Software
Systems Ltd@{UB}.

@{I}Petro Tyschtschenko @{UI}will continue on as managing director of @{B}Amiga International@{UB}
and  will  also  play  a  critical  role  in guiding the current @{B}Amiga @{UB}community
through the transition to the new @{B}Amiga @{UB}architecture. @{I}"The new @{B}Amiga @{UB}plans are a
rebirth for @{B}Amiga @{UB}and an exciting journey into the future," @{UI}said @{I}Tyschtschenko@{UI}.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
February 23, 1999
@{I}For Immediate Release:@{UI}

@{B}Finale Development, Inc. @{UB}is proud to announce the next generation of our popular
usenet  newsreader,  @{B}NewYork  II@{UB},  which will debut at the popular @{B}Gateway Amiga
Show @{UB}in St. Louis, March 12th.

Over  the  past  year we have listened to, and implemented many user suggestions
and  have  arrived  at  what  we  believe to be the best newsreader on the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
platform.

If  the  @{B}Amiga @{UB} press  loved @{B}NewYork @{UB}when it came out two years ago, then we can
hardly  wait  for the reviews of @{B}NewYork II @{UB}.. offline reading, mass-decoding of
entire  newsgroups  at  once,  'bookmarking'  of  important  articles,  powerful
kill-file prefs to block spam .. it's all in there and more.

Wrap  this  up  in  a  familiar, fully @{B}Amiga @{UB}StyleGuide compliant interface that
looks  and  feels  like  an @{B}Amiga @{UB}*should*, and you have a powerful app which is
also easy to master.

For   a   sneak   peak,  visit  the  new  @{B}NewYork  II @{UB} page  on  our  web  site:
@{B}www.finale-dev.com/NewYorkII/index.html@{UB}

You'll  find  the best of the old, supercharged with the brightest of the new in

    the correct conference at all times.
  * SAVEMESSAGE from @{B}ARexx @{UB}has several new arguments.

    setup etc.
  * Trippled  the  minimum  stack size due to reports of a possible problem with
    the stack on advanced multipart messages.
  * You  will  now be allowed to Edit Data on a Forward Msg event and add a text
    comment, or remove the previous text comment.
  * Previous  search results will now be cleared in all conferences and not just
    those that matches the current result.

    selection  of  all  enties  in  all requesters where multiple entries can be
    selected from a list (eg. To Name/Address when sending mail, joining groups,
    etc).
  * Added @{B}FilterThor @{UB}to the external menu. @{B}FilterThor @{UB}is a new @{B}MUI @{UB}based tool to
    configure sortmail triggers.

@{B}TWF @{UB}NEWS UPDATE: 28TH FEBRUARY 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hi,

_#News.#_
     @{B}Explorer 2260 @{UB}Update.
     @{B}Maim & Mangle @{UB}Update.
     Next News Update
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#1. @{B}Explorer 2260 @{UB}Update.#

Development  is currently still on schedule for a 3rd/4th quarter. Currently the
all  important  networking and client server protocol implementation has started
for  playing  @{B}E2260 @{UB} over  the internet. The Shipyard section (Maintenance, ship
purchasing  and armoury) of the station systems is currently being worked on and
we are hoping to have the station systems completed by the end of March.

Graphics  wise,  many  of  the  interfaces  for  the  station  systems are being
developed  and  several  new ships are being modelled and will appear in the CEG
this month.

#2. @{B}Maim & Mangle @{UB}Update.#

Development  is progressing well on the game with the 3D engine being constantly
improved and more features being added including:
  * 8bit engine with @{B}040@{UB}/@{B}060@{UB}/@{B}PPC@{UB}, @{B}AGA@{UB}, CGX, @{B}W3D @{UB}support.
  * 15bit engine with @{B}060@{UB}/@{B}PPC@{UB}, @{B}AGA@{UB}(@{B}HAM8@{UB}), CGX, @{B}W3D @{UB}support.
  * @{I}Lambert @{UI}shading
  * User Selectable Filtering (@{B}W3D@{UB})
  * 3D Explosions to appear in the near future
  * 2  Player  mode  on same @{B}Amiga @{UB}with 2 screens (monitor connected to GFX card
    and one to the TV/Monitor connector).

Work is also being done on an editor for handling all the 3D objects in the game
and  some  basic player controls and pathfinding code to be implemented. The GFX
people  are  working  on modelling some of the buildings and vehicles along with
the texture maps for the 3D engine.

Also  of  note  is  that  we  expect  a  news  item  (with  some  3D engine test
screenshots)  on  the  revival  of @{B}M&M @{UB}to appear in the new @{B}Amiga @{UB}print magazine
@{B}Amiga Active @{UB}which is launched in April. We hope to have a couple of engine test
screenshots on the website within a few weeks also.

#3. Next News Update#

Next Update: 31st March 1999

All the best,

OPEN LETTER TO THE @{B}AMIGA @{UB}COMMUNITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
March 2, 1999

February 8, 1999 - a historical day.

This  day  reminded  me  of  the spirit of 1985, when @{B}Amiga @{UB}was presented to the
world public in New York.

This time a vision is born: Making computers a natural part of everyday life.

It is almost 2 years ago, since the take over by @{B}Gateway@{UB}. Many people know me as
an  impatient  man and you may anticipate how difficult the period from March 97
to  February  8, 1999 was. A time of low communication with the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community,
low public relations and low information about visions, missions and goals.

But my dear Amigans, I can reassure you the ray of hope will become a bright sun
within  the  next  6  month.  The  @{B}Amiga @{UB} will  be  lead to the future under the
technical experienced management of an absolute professional. @{I}Jim Collas@{UI}, Senior
Vice  President Product Development & Management of @{B}Gateway, Inc. @{UB}has decided to
modify  his  position and to work for @{B}Amiga @{UB}only. To reach all our goals, I will
work on his side and support him with all my energy.

@{B}Our mission is:@{UB}

To  create  a  revolutionary  and  compelling systems architecture and operating
environment  for  multimedia  computers and digital information appliances which
can  easily  be  imbedded into consumer computing devices and enables innovative
Internet services.

Without  talk  big,  I  can  tell  you that in the middle of November 99 we will
launch the new @{B}Amiga @{UB}systems architecture and operation environment.

For  this  purpose we will organize press conferences to inform the public about
our  goals  and  directions.  Besides  the new and revolutionary @{B}Amiga @{UB}Operating
System  we  are  working  on our existing platform to present the upgrade @{B}3.5 @{UB}as
soon as possible

First  detailed  information  will  be  presented in St. Louis, USA (March 12. -
14.).  We hope to be in the position to sell the first Operating System upgrades
@{B}3.5 @{UB} in  summer 99. The German company @{B}Haage & Partner @{UB}and myself will take care
about this project.

@{B}AMIGA  International, Inc. @{UB}and @{B}Amiga, Inc. @{UB}will conquer as one team the computer
world;  under  the management of @{I}Jim Collas @{UI}- and you my dear Amigans, will be a
part of it.

Help us performing our goals.

@{I}Jim  Collas @{UI} will  inform you within the next days about the organization, plans
and goals of our company.

A  very  exciting  time  is coming and it is for me and my staff a honor to be a
part  of a new computer generation as pioneer and to pave the way for the future
just like it was at @{B}Commodore@{UB}.

Long live our beloved @{B}Amiga @{UB}and our community

Yours
@{I}Petro Tyschtschenko@{UI}

@{I}PAUL NOLAN @{UI}ANNOUNCES @{B}PHOTOGENICS 4.0@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@{I}For Immediate Release@{UI}
From: Paul Nolan
Data: 9th March 1999

@{I}Paul  Nolan @{UI} is  proud  to  announce  @{B}Photogenics 4.0@{UB}, a complete rewrite of the
original @{B}Photogenics@{UB}, and the culmination of over four years of development.

@{B}Photogenics @{UB} is a graphics/art package. It allows you to create stunning images,
either  from  scratch  or  by  modifying  existing  images. It can be used for a
multitude   of   purposes,  from  simple  file  conversion,  to  advanced  photo
manipulation and re-touching. It also offers extremely realistic and easy to use
media such as pencils, chalk and watercolours to create stunning masterpieces in
minutes.

@{B}Photogenics @{UB} is  based on innovation. At its core, it works on images unlike any
other  product. Nothing you draw is permanent, it can be rubbed out as easily as
it  was  drawn, and tweaked to perfection. This freedom allows you to experiment
to a level never before seen.

@{I}@{B}Photogenics 4.0 @{UB}features:@{UI}
  * @{I}Unparalleled  levels  of  creativity @{UI} from  being able to modify the colour,
    transparency,  image processing mode, and even the position of what you have
    drawn, all in real time!
  * @{I}Realistic  Media tools @{UI}such as Airbrush, Chalk, Pencil, Sponge, Watercolour,
    Smudge and Smear.
  * @{I}Designed to look and feel good using just a standard mouse@{UI}.
  * @{I}Paint-on Image Processing @{UI}allows the user to apply effects simply by drawing
    with  any of the media tools. Being able to just airbrush everything on (and
    off!)  allows  instant touch ups without the need for tedious masking. Paint
    modes          available          include          AddColour,         Adjust
    (Brightness/Contrast/Red/Green/Blue),  Bas  Relief,  BiColour,  Blur,  Burn,
    BurnThru, Clone, ColourToGrey, Convolve, Darken, DifferenceRGB, DisplaceMap,
    Dodge,  EdgeDetect,  Emboss,  FlipX,  FlipY,  Hardlight,  Lighten, Min, Max,
    MotionBlur,   Multiply,   Negative,   Overlay,   Paint,  PanBlur,  Pixelize,
    Posterize,  RadialBlur,  Roll,  RubPaint,  RubThru,  Screen, Fire, Solarize,
    Softlight, SubtractColour, and Tint.
  * @{I}Exclusive  Paint  Layer  technology @{UI}allows mistakes to be rubbed out without
    having  to  redo  the  good parts, simply by fading out with the right mouse
    button.
  * @{I}Undo/Redo  system @{UI} allows  you to go back as far as you specify, so that you
    have the power of both undo styles.
  * @{I}Unlimited  number  of  easy  to use layers @{UI}allows fast image composition and
    amazing possibilities.
  * @{I}Stunning  Paint-On  Pyrotechnics @{UI} such as lens-flares, fire, and explosions.
    Combine  with  smear  to produce supernovas, waves of fire, and even sunsets
    and waterfalls.
  * @{I}Innovative  clutter free user interface @{UI}(font sensitive and user scaleable).
    GUI components can be docked/undocked, and positioned wherever you please.
  * @{I}Fully  multi-threaded @{UI}- you'll never be kept waiting as @{B}Photogenics @{UB}responds
    instantly to your requests even while operations are in progress.
  * @{I}Advanced  yet still easy to use Alpha channel support@{UI}. Use any open image as
    a  mask,  or simply paint one straight on to the image. Updates to the Alpha
    channel such as brush strokes are reflected on the main image in real time.
  * @{I}24bit  Alpha  channels@{UI}. Only @{B}Photogenics @{UB}lets you use colour Alpha channels,
    which  enable  you  to  independently  mask  each of the red, green and blue
    channels.  Paint on the Alpha with red, and this lets the red component show
    through,  paint  on  with  yellow,  and  both the red and green channels are
    updated.  Painting  with  shades  of  grey produce masking as normal. Create
    awesome  effects  by  loading  in a 24bit Alpha channel and using it to mask
    image-processing effects.
  * @{I}Text  Tool @{UI} -  finally  you can just drag a box where you want the text, and
    type  it  straight  onto  any  paint  layer. Supports bitmapped and scalable
    fonts, with antialiasing.
  * @{I}Multiple  Views @{UI} - allows you to have as many views of an image as you like,
    each with its own magnification.
  * @{I}Impressive  colour  selection facilities@{UI}, with five colour choosers, RGB and
    HSV  sliders, and support for 256 colour swatches. You can also pick colours
    from Images, with changes updating in real time.
  * @{I}Extensive  file  format  support@{UI}.  Current  list includes loading and saving
    @{B}IFF-ILBM@{UB},  @{B}IFF-DEEP@{UB},  @{B}JPEG@{UB},  @{B}Targa@{UB},  @{B}TIFF@{UB},  @{B}BMP@{UB},  @{B}PNG@{UB},  with more to follow.
    @{B}Photogenics @{UB}also supports loading with 24bit DataTypes.
  * @{I}24bit Printing support via @{B}StudioPrint@{UB}@{UI}.
  * @{I}Open  Architecture @{UI} -  @{B}Photogenics @{UB}is effectively just one big collection of
    plug-ins  that blends seamlessly to form one program. Third party developers
    can  have access to the same API as @{B}Photogenics @{UB}does, allowing developers to
    extend the core software to an amazing degree.

Minimum Requirements: @{B}68020@{UB}, 8Mb RAM, @{B}Amiga OS 3.0@{UB}, CD ROM drive.
Recommended Requirements: @{B}68060@{UB}, 16 or 24bit display, 16Mb RAM, @{B}Amiga OS 3.0@{UB}, CD
ROM drive.

Pricing details to follow shortly.

@{I}JIM COLLAS @{UI}AND @{I}JEFF SCHINDLER @{UI}ANSWER QUESTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  following  edited  IRC  transcript is from a session held at the Henry VIII
Hotel,  in  St.  Louis Mo., site of the @{B}Amiga99 @{UB}show. In it, @{I}Jim Collas @{UI}and @{I}Jeff
Schindler @{UI} of  @{B}Amiga  Inc. @{UB} answer  questions  from  @{B}Amiga @{UB}users gathered on the
channel. The channel was sponsored by the @{B}User Group Network@{UB}.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}Jeff_SHOW @{UI}
      I  want to say that I am with @{I}Jim Collas @{UI}all the way I have never seen him
      so excited and I have worked with him for 5 years
@{I}HammerD @{UI}
      1) What will the first product be?
@{I}Jeff_SHOW @{UI}
      The  first  product  will be a development system followed by a multimedia
      computer
@{I}HammerD @{UI}
      2) What will be the price point of the multimedia computer?
@{I}Jeff_SHOW @{UI}
      We are not at that point to know the price but as @{I}Jim @{UI}said tonight we want
      to allow computers at a $500 price to be as powerfull as a $3000 @{B}PC@{UB}
@{I}HammerD @{UI}
      3)  Have  any  major  software firms pledged support for @{B}Amiga NG @{UB}(besides
      @{B}QNX@{UB})? Any details?
@{I}Jeff_SHOW @{UI}
      We  are  talking  to several major software application companies, this is
      why  we have @{I}Jim Von Holle @{UI}on staff this is his expertise at this point no
      company has said no
@{I}HammerD @{UI}
      4) Can you reveal any details about the processors supported in @{B}Amiga NG @{UB}?
      MMC chip?
@{I}Jeff_SHOW @{UI}
      We  plan to support mulitple CPU's. Back to the software question, we will
      need  as many of you to write apps for the new @{B}Amiga@{UB}. This is critical for
      the revoluiton to take place
@{I}HammerD @{UI}
      4)  Do  you  plan to use the existing dealer network to sell the @{B}Amiga NG@{UB}?
      Any programs to help them?
@{I}Jeff_SHOW @{UI}
      Yes this is what @{I}Petro @{UI}is intending to do
@{I}HammerD @{UI}
      When will we get details on the architecture?
@{I}Jeff_SHOW @{UI}
      We  are  hoping  to  have  developer conferences in the summer & fall Keep
      @{B}Amiga @{UB}in your heart see ya

@{I}ZEUS^ @{UI}
      Do you plan to show @{B}NG @{UB}prototypes on @{B}CEBIT @{UB}or something (@{B}Wintel @{UB}market)?
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      Our first general industry show will be fall @{B}Comdex@{UB}
@{B}Timmer@{UB}
      jim: what compilers will be supplied with the dev system and @{B}5.0@{UB}? eg. @{B}GCC@{UB},
      @{B}Metroworks@{UB}, @{B}WatCom@{UB}?
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      We have not determined this yet.
@{I}Blitter @{UI}
      What  types of applications do we need to create as a community? Any ideas
      from  the developement that has happenend so far? @{I}Jeff @{UI}stated you need our
      help with apps. for the @{B}NG Amiga@{UB}.
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      Games,  multimedia, Internet based S/W, things that will be innovative and
      exciting. We will be looking for developers to help us once we get a solid
      foundation in Q3. We will be posting information on our Web site.
@{I}amidude @{UI}
      What marketing/advertising will be used to reach 20-30 million units sold?
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      There  will be significant marketing funds starting later this year but we
      will also depend on large volume OEMs to use @{B}Amiga @{UB}as a standard.
@{I}cade @{UI}
      @{I}Jim@{UI}, thanks and we are SOOOo happy to have you with us. Thank you so much!
      Question:  What about other countries? Will you be targeting mainly the US
      in  the  beginning?  What  about small countries like South Africa? Can we
      expect some form of Hype and marketing?
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      We  intend  to drive AMiga as a global company but will start our focus in
      couuntries  with  a significant @{B}Amiga @{UB}presence i.e. Germany, U.K., and the
      U.S.
@{I}Ng @{UI}
      How  do  you  see  the new @{B}Amiga @{UB}coping with the growing popularity of the
      "free"  OS,  @{B}Linux @{UB} and  it's  suitablitiy  to  all  of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s target
      markets?
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      We  are  evaluating  the  @{B}Linux @{UB} O/S  to  understand how we may be able to
      support @{B}Linux @{UB}environments. No plans yet.
@{I}CyberWolf @{UI}
      Q:  Is  @{B}Metabox @{UB} (formerly  @{B}PIOS@{UB})  involved  in the development of the new
      @{B}AMIGA@{UB}s?
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      They are not directly invloved but we are in touch with them to understand
      what they are doing.
@{I}Tiggster @{UI}
      We have heard that @{B}Amiga, Inc. @{UB}is primarily a software company. Will @{B}AI @{UB}be
      releasing  an  @{B}AmigaNG @{UB}computer or will that be the responsibility of your
      partners?
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      We  will be introducing exciting new hardware also but we want an open H/W
      architecture  so  that  the  @{B}Amiga @{UB} environment  will  be used in multiple
      products.
@{I}OSS542 @{UI}
      We  am  interested  in  porting our current software to the the new @{B}Amiga@{UB}.
      What sort of development support can we expect for this ? BTW: Just bought
      a new @{B}GPS-450 @{UB}the other day :-) Doa though :-(
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      We  will  be  publishing  all  required  information  for  developers when
      available.  We  will  also have engineering people dedicated to supporting
      developers.   We  are  currently  hring  engineering  people  in  our  new
      engineering facility in San Jose under Dr. @{I}Allan Havemose@{UI}.
@{I}Dracvl @{UI}
      Firstly:  Welcome  aboard,  Mr.  @{I}Collas@{UI}. Questions: 1. Will the dev.system
      require  anything  but  a normal @{B}x86@{UB}-based-@{B}PC@{UB}? 2. How about pricing - will
      the development package be free?
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      We are thinking about offering a multimedia card as part of the O/S bundle
      to  allow for advanced multimedia features and performance that may not be
      available  in  all @{B}PC@{UB}s. We have not determined any pricing for development
      environment. We may have 3rd party costs associated.
@{I}NorthWay @{UI}
      When  will we get some _solid_ info to judge what the new @{B}Amiga @{UB}will be? I
      don't  think  you  expect  anyone  to  show  up  on a DevCon without prior
      knowledge. and I'd like a porting layer too :).
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      We  should  be  releasing  detailed  information in July/August. It may be
      earlier if we feel that it will help people start development.
@{I}Mawrick @{UI}
      Will  there be developement tools that will be as good as @{B}Borland @{UB}builder,
      @{B}VC @{UB} (or similar products)? And, are you going to have some sort of fees on
      sw-development licenses like @{B}ms-wind*** @{UB}:)?
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      We  are still working on development environment plans. Don't expect to be
      like @{B}MS@{UB}.
@{I}Zap @{UI}
      Are  the  slides  that  where shown going to be made public so we can view
      them via www?
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      We  are  releasing  to  the  press tomorrow and will post on the site next
      week.
@{I}HammerD @{UI}
      1)  Can  you release more specific information on @{B}OS 3.5 @{UB}features? 2) Will
      @{B}Amiga  International @{UB} sell the planned multimedia computer under the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
      name? (as @{B}C= @{UB}sold the @{B}A1200@{UB}) or will you depend solely on 3rd parties?
@{I}Jim @{UI}
      @{B}OS  3.5 @{UB} features were disclosed today. They will be on the Web site early
      next  week.  I understand that we have fallen short in certain areas. I am
      working  on  plan  for  better developers support. I will be reviewing the
      classic  @{B}PCI @{UB}situation next week. I can't give you a final statement until
      I meet with them.

@node not31 "OFFICIAL STATEMENT OF AROS TEAM STATUS"

OFFICIAL STATEMENT OF @{B}AROS @{UB}TEAM STATUS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is an official statement about the current status of the @{B}AROS @{UB}project.

As of writing, the @{B}AROS @{UB}source code is about 29MB and about 56% of all functions
are implemented (13% more are currently in progress).

Currently, we are working hard on finishing graphics, layers and intuition based
on  our  new  @{B}HIDD @{UB} system.  The  @{B}HIDD @{UB} system  will allow us to put any kind of
hardware  below  @{B}AROS @{UB}with only very little effort for people who want/need/have
to  write a driver for a new piece of hardware. This work is mostly done by @{I}Nils
Henrik  Lorentzen @{UI} and @{I}Stefan Berger@{UI}. The main goal is to have a version of @{B}AROS@{UB}
which  can  open a screen, create windows on it and let the use manipulate them.
Currently,  @{B}X11 @{UB} is  used  to  create  the  windows  and  @{B}X11 @{UB}also allows one to
manipulate them. The time-frame for this is May.

@{I}Michael Schulz @{UI}has committed very promising code which can be compiled, saved on
a  floppy and then be used to boot a small part of @{B}AROS @{UB}on a bare @{B}IBM @{UB}compatible
@{B}PC@{UB}.  When  the  new graphics system is ready, writing a @{B}VGA @{UB}driver should take a
day (if not less) and @{B}AROS @{UB}should be able to open a workbench screen and windows
on  it.  No  workbench  yet, though :-) @{B}AROS @{UB}does already boot but it doesn't do
much yet.

The  next  step  would  be  to  finish the console.device (half of it is already
finished)  and  put  the  input.device  on  top  of the @{B}HIDD @{UB}system. This should
integrate  @{B}X11 @{UB} (or whatever is below @{B}AROS@{UB}) nicely into the @{B}AROS @{UB}system allowing
to  open  a  shell  on  an  @{B}AROS @{UB} screen.  This  will  be done by @{I}Nils @{UI}and @{I}Johan
Alfredsson@{UI},  who  is also working on the Commodities. This should take about one
month.

When  the @{B}HIDD@{UB}s for @{B}PC @{UB}hardware are finished (mostly done by @{I}Michael Schulz@{UI}), it
should  be  possible  to boot @{B}AROS @{UB}from a diskette and use a shell to enter some
commands.  An @{B}FFS @{UB}file system also seems at the brink of completion, so creating
an  @{B}Amiga @{UB} partition  and  installing  it  on  the  hard  disk will then soon be
possible. No time frame has been set for all this, yet. It mainly depends on how
much  (correct)  information  books  about @{B}PC @{UB}hardware contain, how the code for
@{B}Linux @{UB} looks  like and such. @{I}Branko Collin @{UI}is meanwhile working on improving the
documentation  (the  web  pages  are  not exactly... "sexy" :-), fixing the many
typos and writing documentation about how to write documentation.

@{I}Kars  de  Jong @{UI} is  working  on  the @{B}Linux@{UB}/@{B}m68k @{UB}port of @{B}AROS @{UB}which allows to run
binary  @{B}Amiga @{UB} software.  Some simple programs already work. When not working on
Layers,  @{I}Stefan Berger @{UI}tries to compile programs from Fish disks and @{B}AmiNET @{UB}work
on @{B}AROS@{UB}.

@{I}Bernhard Fastenrath @{UI}and @{I}Aaron Digulla @{UI}work on merging @{B}AROS @{UB}with @{B}UAE @{UB}which should
allow  to make @{B}UAE @{UB}faster and run native @{B}Amiga @{UB}programs in an emulator when @{B}AROS@{UB}
is  able  to  run  standalone  (that  is,  without  the  help of @{B}Linux@{UB}). We will
investigate  the  necessary  steps  and do tests during March. At the end of the
month, the next step will be decided.

@{I}Przemyslaw  Szczygielski @{UI} and  @{I}Claus  Herrmann @{UI} are  looking at @{B}PPC @{UB}support. The
former  for  a port to @{B}LinuxPPC @{UB}and the latter for making @{B}Exec @{UB}on the @{B}Amiga @{UB}work
on  @{B}PPC @{UB} (thus  using  the  power of the @{B}PPC @{UB}to run @{B}Amiga @{UB}software on an @{B}Amiga@{UB}).
@{I}Przemo @{UI}hopes for some results in May and I must convince @{I}Claus @{UI}to merge his code
with ours :-)

What  the  future  might  bring, who knows. The main goals right now are to make
@{B}AROS @{UB} work  as a standalone system which can boot from a hard disk, writing some
drivers  for the @{B}HIDD @{UB}system so we can see if everything really fits to where it
belongs,  rewrite  the most complex part of the @{B}AmigaOS@{UB}: Intuition, Graphics and
Layers.

The  future  will hopefully see a commercial version of @{B}AROS @{UB}(so that we can pay
@{B}Amiga  Inc. @{UB} some  money  so  they keep calm), a free version of @{B}AROS @{UB}(just like
@{B}Linux@{UB}: free without support or commercial with support), many more @{B}HIDD@{UB}s, a port
of @{B}AROS @{UB}to @{B}PPC@{UB}. But that doesn't mean that you can sit back, relax and watch our
progress  (which  is  now  updated daily on (@{B}www.aros.org/progress.gif@{UB}). We need
you!

Currently,  more  and  more  parts  of  @{B}AROS @{UB}are being finished and we need some
real-world code to test @{B}AROS@{UB}. What code would that be? Here are the criteria:
  * It must only use pure @{B}AmigaOS @{UB}calls (no @{B}MUI @{UB}or such)
  * No  hardware  banging  or  calls to things like "MrgCop()", "CWait()" or the
    like  (usually  functions  which  directly  relate  to  some  @{B}Amiga @{UB}hardware
    specific feature). Most Blitter-Functions are ok, however.
  * NO ASSEMBLER CODE!
  * It  should  compile  with  recent  versions of @{B}SAS/C@{UB}, @{B}GCC@{UB}, @{B}StormC @{UB}or another
    @{B}ANSI-C @{UB}compiler.
  * They should be not too big (don't send in 1.5MB of source code, yet).

If you happen to have such a gem, then send it to: @{I}aros-code@aros.fh-konstanz.de@{UI}

Please  make  absolutely  clear  if  you mind if your code is published with the
source code of @{B}AROS @{UB}or not. We promise that we won't touch any copyright notices
(except  for adding them if they are missing, so you get your credit). It's just
that  you might not want that the code is revealed for any reason which would be
ok for us. We just need to know :-)

SERVER FOR @{B}AMICOMSYS @{UB}NEEDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Hello!

I'm  the  author  of @{B}AmiComSys@{UB}, a program to find @{B}Amiga @{UB}buddies on the Internet,
chat and send files.

It's  rather  similar  to the famous @{B}ICQ @{UB}but currently only for @{B}Amiga@{UB}. @{B}AmiComSys@{UB}
was born April 1997.

The  reason  for  writing  is  that  I  need a new full time server, because the
current server, @{B}amicomsys.tibb.at@{UB}, have been down for more than 5 weeks now.

The server software @{B}AmiComSys @{UB}connects to is named @{B}AMarqueed@{UB}, which is a part of
the  @{B}AMarquee@{UB}-package.  You  may find information about it at the following URL:
@{B}hem.passagen.se/hparting/amarquee@{UB}

@{B}AmiComSys @{UB} have  about  300  users, of about 20 is online at the same time. This
means that the server won't take very much bandwidth.

So  if  you  have  an  @{B}Amiga @{UB}that is connected to the Internet 24 hours a day, I
would appreciate very much if you could let me use it for the server.

The @{B}AmiComSys @{UB}home page is located at @{B}surf.to/AmiComSys@{UB}

Subject: @{B}Aminet @{UB}downtime: We're moving
Date: 16 Mar 1999 22:38:16 GMT

Because   of   continued   file  system  troubles  on  the  current  main  site,
@{B}wuarchive.wustl.edu@{UB},  we're  moving  the main site to Germany. @{B}wuarchive @{UB}will be
back  as  a  mirror when the file system trouble is resolved. The main site will
very probably remain in Germany and we're trying to set up a computer of our own
as  main  site  so  we're  no  longer at the mercy of system operators. The most
reliable  site  during  this  transition should be @{B}de.aminet.net @{UB}with most other
mirrors being fully operational immediately or within days. I cannot predict for
how long @{B}wuarchive @{UB}will be down. Sorry about the inconvenience, really not under
my control.

Hello,

I apologise for the fact that the @{B}SS3000 @{UB}demo hasn't been released yet as we are
still  tweaking  it  to perfection. The intro animation is finished now and it's
looking  great with 2 minutes and 20 seconds of lightwave-rendered animation! As
you can see, we are leaving no stone un-turned.

We are hoping to release @{B}SS3000 @{UB}in April.

There are no release for our other games yet.

@{B}HAAGE&PARTNER @{UB}ANNOUNCES @{B}ARTEFFECT 3.0@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  new  version  of  @{B}ArtEffect @{UB}offer a lot of new functions an most parts have
been  reworked.  The  most  conspicuous  features  are: heavily improved layers,
indexed colors, improved color ranges, new filters and many optimizations.

Here is a complete list of the new features:
  * @{I}Enhanced memory management@{UI}
      - pictures now take up to 3 times less memory
      - smart  undo  technology  saves  lots  of memory and time especially when
        working with layers or invertable operations like flip, rotate or invert
        selection
      - layers needs much less memory
  * @{I}Layer functionality has been strongly enhanced@{UI}
      - there is no limit to the number of layers (of course the number is still
        limited  by  memory  and a bit by processor speed, although ten layers a
        still quite fast)
      - layers can cast an adjustable shadow which is calculated on the fly
      - layers can be moved around
      - several layers can be flattened at once
      - layers can be duplicated
  * @{I}Support for grayscale and indexed color pictures@{UI}
      - floyd  steinberg  dithering and reduction to any number of colors from 2
        to 256
      - execute  simple  operations  (like  flip, scale, rotate) on grayscale or
        indexed color pictures
      - most  tools  can  be  used  with  grayscale  or  indexed color pictures,
        although they act very limited. (no different paint modes anymore)
  * @{I}Graduates have been vastly improved@{UI}
      - there  are new types of graduates like: square, symmetric and asymmetric
        conical
      - new  graduate  dialog  allows  you  to specify any number of colors with
        their position in the graduate; they can be simply moved around
      - you  can  specify  the transparency for the graduate separately; this is
        great  to  create  halos  or lensflare effects, when used in conjunction
        with the radial fill
      - database  for  the  graduates,  so you know longer have to setup up them
        each  time  you  need  them; a simple click will be enough, if they once
        have been created
      - the graduate database is stored in an ASCII file, making it easy to join
        different databases or create graduates with simple programs
  * @{I}Enhanced brush creator dialog@{UI}
      - brushes (even image brushes) can now vary in size (depending on pressure
        or randomly)
      - brushes have now a displacement setting, making it easy to create clouds
        (in  conjunction with the new sizing feature) or simulate the old dpaint
        airbrush behavior
  * @{I}I/O modules have been improved@{UI}
      - GIF can now save 1-8 bit/color pictures
      - GIF pictures can also have transparency
      - IFF/PNG can now save 8 bit colors pictures
      - JPEG can now create progressive Jpeg
  * @{I}New intelligent refresh technique@{UI}
      - can speed up drawing (depending on your machine)
      - allows  you  to  scroll  or  zoom  the  picture,  before  the refresh is
        completely finished
      - you  can even draw onto the picture, although the refresh isn't finished
        yet
      - calculations  are done on the fly (this is the main reason for the lower
        memory  consumption); this has the disadvantage that the refresh time is
        mainly limited to your processor power
  * @{I}New/enhanced plugins@{UI}
      - deinterlace filter
      - caricature filter is now 30% faster and has some new options
      - new  gaussian,  it's much faster and supports a size up to 100 pixels in
        1/10 pixel steps
      - polar coordinate filter
      - edgefind has been optimized and a lineart mode has been added
  * @{I}minor enhancements, optimizations and bug fixes@{UI}
      - cloner  now  behaves like in Photoshop lalt click selects the source the
        next click selects destination

ANNOUNCEMENT: @{B}THE MIDWEST AMIGA EXPOSITION@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

From: @{I}Dave Pearce @{UI}@{I}dpearce@infinet.com@{UI}@{UI}
Organization: @{B}The Amiga Central Ohio Network@{UB}
Date: March 25th, 1999

To all @{B}Amiga @{UB}supporters:

Many of you have emailed us asking whether or not the @{B}Amiga Central Ohio Network@{UB}
will  produce the @{B}Midwest Amiga Exposition @{UB}for 1999. At this time we will not be
producing a show for 1999.

Our  show  was  created by everyday users for the sole purpose of supporting the
@{B}Amiga @{UB} during  some  of it's roughest times. In 1996, when we started our event,
most  other  events  had  closed  their  doors  and  an  important role was left
unfulfilled.  We  felt  we  needed  to support a diminishing market during those
times for other users and more importantly, developers.

While  some  might  argue,  we  believe we had a small role in helping the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
trade  show  market in the U.S. become active again. @{B}Amiga @{UB}trade events are once
again  gaining  popularity  and  increasing  in size, so rather than compete for
exhibitors  and  attendees,  we  have  decided  it is time to step aside and let
others continue on.

The  @{B}Amiga @{UB} situation  is  currently  more  positive than in the past and we are
excited  about  the  recent  developments at @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}. We will not rule out the
possibility  of bringing back the @{B}Midwest Amiga Exposition @{UB}in the years to come,
but  for  now,  we  are  confident  that  @{B}Amiga @{UB} trade  shows in the U.S. are in
competent and capable hands.

We  have put together a scrapbook from each year of the @{B}Midwest Amiga Exposition@{UB}
and  we  encourage  you to visit our web site at @{B}www.amicon.org/mae.html @{UB}and see
what it was like to be there.

There are simply too many people to thank in the end for what has become for us,
a  personal  chapter  in  the history of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. Our debt of gratitude to the
@{B}Amiga @{UB}community and to the developers that stuck it out is too large to measure.

Sincerely,

@{I}David Pearce@{UI}
President
@{B}The Amiga Central Ohio Network@{UB}

@{B}NOVA DESIGN @{UB}ANNOUNCES POWERSTATION FOR @{B}IMAGEFX@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@{B}Nova  Design,  Inc.@{UB},  producers  of  the  award winning and best selling @{B}ImageFX@{UB}
package  are  proud  to  announce  the impending release of the first package of
@{B}PowerPC @{UB}modules for @{B}ImageFX@{UB}.

Code  named  @{B}PowerStation@{UB},  volume 1 is a package of @{B}ImageFX @{UB}modules designed to
work  with  the @{B}PowerPC @{UB}as a coprocessor. This speeds up the specific modules up
to  ten  times the speed of the same module running on a native @{B}68060 @{UB}processor.
In many cases the effects become nearly real-time!

@{B}PowerStation @{UB} premiered  to record crowds at the @{B}Amiga '99 @{UB}show in St. Louis and
became the 'must-have' item of the show!

@{I}@{B}PowerStation @{UB}Specifics@{UI}

The  @{B}PowerPC @{UB} effects  are  for  use with @{B}ImageFX 3.2 @{UB}or higher only. This first
volume  of  modules  includes the following effects, which have all received the
@{B}PowerPC @{UB} treatment.  You  might  also find a few other extras included with this
@{B}PowerPC @{UB}package as well!
  * @{I}Bubble @{UI} - creates multiple bubbles over your selected image. You can control
    the  animation  and optional color of the bubbles easily. Create an undersea
    effect or psychedelic champagne bubbles!
  * @{I}Fire @{UI} -  one  of  @{B}ImageFX@{UB}'s most popular effects. Fire can create flickering
    candle   flames,  gas-stove  flames,  raging  forest  fires  and  more.  All
    parameters can be animated or controlled through a single slider.
  * @{I}Clouds @{UI} -  recently  added  to @{B}ImageFX@{UB}, the @{I}Clouds @{UI}effect can create amazing
    multi-layered  fractal  clouds.  It  can also be used to create fog or smoke
    over  images,  simulated explosions, or even seamless textures of landscapes
    with cloud patterns animating across them.
  * @{I}Liquid @{UI}- this is an endlessly fascinating effect that distorts your image as
    if  it  were  on water. You can create funhouse mirror distortions or unique
    video transitions with this effect.
  * @{I}@{B}FXForge@{UB} @{UI} -  based  on  the  same  formulas  used in @{B}Adobe Photoshop@{UB}'s @{B}Filter
    Factory @{UB} package,  @{B}FXForge @{UB} can  create an infinite number of custom special
    effects  using  mathematical  formulas.  Color  effects, distorting effects,
    lighting effects are all possible with this amazing engine. It remains fully
    compatible  with  the  thousands  of  effects  available on the Internet for
    @{B}Adobe@{UB}'s @{B}Filter Factory@{UB}.

@{I}Special Preorder Pricing@{UI}

'@{B}PowerStation@{UB}'  is  available  on diskette for $99.95 and will be available from
your  favorite  @{B}Amiga @{UB} dealer  soon.  However,  @{B}ImageFX  3.x @{UB}owners can preorder
directly  from  @{B}Nova  Design,  Inc. @{UB}for only $79.95 plus shipping ($7 within the
continental  US,  $15  elsewhere) right now! Offer good through the end of April

@{I}Fabian Jimenez@{UI}, @{B}UGN @{UB}Public Relations - @{I}fabian@cais.com@{UI}

Location: @{B}ugn.amiga.org/arn@{UB}

The  @{B}User  Group Network @{UB}(@{B}UGN@{UB}) is pleased to announce the arrival of @{B}Amiga Radio
News@{UB}.  @{B}Amiga  Radio  News @{UB} the  first @{B}Amiga @{UB}news source to broadcast live to the
Internet using streaming audio! @{B}Amiga User Groups @{UB}can download and playback this
weekly  @{B}Amiga @{UB} news  update.  Every  Friday, a new update will uploaded to @{B}Amiga
Radio News@{UB}. @{B}Amiga Radio News @{UB}is located at @{B}ugn.amiga.org/arn@{UB}.

In  order  to  listen to the @{B}Amiga Radio News @{UB}you will need to download an @{B}Amiga@{UB}
compatible  streaming  audio  player  that  supports  either  ADPCM or GSM 6.10.
Fortunately   two   such   players   exist   and   are   available  off  Aminet.
ADPCM_Package.lha  is  needed  for  the  ADPCM file, and GIR06.lha is needed for
listening  to the GSM encoded file. In the future Real Audio, MP3, and 8SVX file
formats may be added.

The  @{B}User  Group  Network @{UB}is an organization dedicated to the advancement of the
@{B}Amiga @{UB} computing  platform  and  the  fostering  of  @{B}Amiga @{UB} oriented User Groups
worldwide.  The  @{B}UGN @{UB} will  work co-operatively with the owners, licensees, user
groups,  and  the  users  to  establish  and  expand a customer support base for
licensed  @{B}Amiga @{UB} computer  products.  The @{B}UGN @{UB}will endeavor to provide a single,
centralized  resource  for the promotion and assistance of User Groups and users

@{B}VAPORWARE @{UB}ANNOUNCES THE AVAILABILITY OF @{B}MICRODOT II 1.3@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@{B}MicroDot  II @{UB}is an integrated standalone mailer and newsreader written by @{I}Oliver
Wagner @{UI} (@{I}owagner@vapor.com@{UI}).  It  is  a  part of the @{B}VaporWare @{UB}suite of Internet
applications.  For  more  information  on  @{B}MD2 @{UB} or any other @{B}VaporWare @{UB}products,
please see our website - @{B}www.vapor.com/@{UB}.

Please use the included Installer script to install @{B}MD-2@{UB}, the required libraries
and @{B}MUI @{UB}custom classes.

Starting  with  version  1.2,  the  old  @{B}MD-2 @{UB} keyfiles  won't work anymore. New
keyfiles  have been mailed out to everyone who already registered; if you didn't
receive  your  updated  keyfile  yet,  please  mail  @{I}@{UI}stating  where and when you
originally ordered @{B}MicroDot II@{UB}.

Where to download it:

FTP:
  * @{B}ftp.vapor.com@{UB}, pub/microdot-2/
  * @{B}ftp.us.vapor.com@{UB}, pub/microdot-2/
  * @{B}ftp.pl.vapor.com@{UB}, pub/vapor/microdot-2/

  * md2_13.lzx, 490587 Bytes
  * md2_13.lha, 441217 Bytes

WWW:
  * @{B}www.vapor.com@{UB}
  * @{B}vapor.ukonline.co.uk @{UB}(File mirror only)

EMail-Fileserver:
  * Mail to @{I}fileserv@vapor.com@{UI}@{UI}, put "SEND MD2" in the body.
  * The file will be returned uuencoded.

Changes since the last public release:

1.2.1
  * DB:  corrupt  index  files  could crash the database cleanup due to a buffer
    overflow

1.2.2
  * Net: added "Esoteric" page to network settings, allowing users to change the
    ports used for SMTP, POP3 and NNTP connects.
  * DB:  when  fetching  messages  and  an index wasn't loaded into memory, @{B}MD-2@{UB}
    wouldn't  close  the  buffered index file, thus potentially losing data when
    the system crashed while downloading.
  * Net:  will  now save overall transient data structures after doing a network
    fetch  (to avoid message number mismatchs when crashing -- although this was
    not  really  a problem, because the numbers in the group index are recovered
    when entering a group)

1.2.3
  * Net: Status window will now show the "login" message of the relevant service
    which was contacted
  * Net:  Download manager will now issue a pop3 LIST command to get the size of
    the  messages in question when necessary (aka, size wasn't returned with the
    TOP)
  * Net:  Modified  handling  of  UIDL history. Now UIDL.history is only written
    when  "DELETE  MAIL ON SERVER" is turned off (makes no sense otherwise), and
    the  new  UIDLs  are  only written until after the complete message fetch is
    done  (to avoid @{B}MD-2 @{UB}skipping messages during the next fetch which were lost
    due to a system crash)
  * GUI: Message reader now uses Textinput "NoInput" objects for the info lines,
    thus allowing copy&paste

1.2.4
  * Net:  fixed  obscure behavior when a news server would do a "NEXT" properly,
    but  then  bail  out on the following "ARTICLE" with some internal error. In
    that  case,  @{B}MD-2 @{UB} would  abort  the news fetch and store an invalid article
    pointer, thus refetching the group from scratch next time.
  * GUI:  "Default  address"  in  group prefs is now only available for mail sub
    groups

1.3
  * added updated vapor_toolkit.library to release archive
  * added updated vapor_registration.library to release archive
  * added new Textinput revision to release archive

@{B}WARPUP 4@{UB}TO BE RELEASED SOON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@{B}SAUG-News @{UB} has  just  learned  that  a  new release of @{B}WarpUp @{UB}should come at the
beginning of April, maybe a bit earlier.

Most  new  features were added to support developers, which requested them to be
able  to  develop  very  special  @{B}AMIGA  PPC @{UB} software. Therefore the new WarpOS
version will be required for some of these new projects.

On  the other hand, @{B}Haage&Partner @{UB}plan to release the final @{B}Warp3D2 @{UB}sometimes in
late  march, or earlier, if possible. They would like to fix as many problems as
possible until the final V2 release.

@{B}COREL OFFICE @{UB}FOR @{B}AMIGA NG@{UB}?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It  has  been  reported that @{B}Com-Digit Journal 3/99 @{UB}states on page 33 that @{B}Corel@{UB}
has announced the porting of @{B}Corel Office @{UB}for the next generation @{B}Amiga@{UB}. This is
done to ensure a broad support base to better compete with the @{B}Microsoft Office@{UB}.

Those  of  you who have listened to @{B}Amiga @{UB}president @{I}Jim Collas@{UI}' @{B}Amiga '99 @{UB}speech
should  remember  @{B}Gateway@{UB}'s  dealings with @{B}Corel@{UB}. In his speech Mr. @{I}Collas @{UI}tells
us,  that  he  and  the  new head of marketing at @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB}, @{I}Jim VonHolle@{UI}, were
responsible  for  the  shipping  of  @{B}Corel @{UB} products  with  @{B}Gateway PC@{UB}s. So, the
connection  seems  quite  obvious.  @{B}Amiga  Inc. @{UB} is  talking to the big boys and
getting some results.

Please  note that I have not personally seen or read the @{B}Com-Digit @{UB}article. This
information was posted on a @{B}Amiga @{UB}newsgroup and should be taken as such. Someone
also said, that he saw the same announcement on @{B}PC World@{UB}.

@node not47 "UPDATE ON THE CYBERSTORM G3/G4"

UPDATE ON THE @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only  four days after the first announcement of the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}project, we
have seen a very positive and exciting feedback by the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community, which we
highly  appreciate  and which supports our hope that we can realize this project
(although we still have to collect a large number of preorders).

At  the  same time, a lot of questions came up, and also a lot of comments about
the features of the board. We have taken those into consideration, and can today
already  announce  that  we  have  improved the specifications of the @{B}CYBERSTORM
G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB} Accelerator;  please read below about the new feature. We would also like
to  address  some questions which remained open or have been asked by many @{B}Amiga@{UB}
users, so please read on to hear the latest news about this stunning project.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{U}Specification Update: @{B}UW-SCSI @{UB}on board at no additional cost @{UU}

Reacting  on the large number of requests, we have decided to integrate an @{B}Ultra
Wide  SCSI II @{UB}controller (Fast-20 standard) on the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}board, which
will perform @{B}SCSI @{UB}bus transfers in single-ended and differential mode with up to
40 MB/s (synchronous @{B}Ultra SCSI @{UB}(Fast-20) transfers). This @{B}SCSI @{UB}chip is based on
the  same  core (and comes from the same vendor) as the powerful @{B}SCSI @{UB}controller
which   is   already  standard  on  our  @{B}Cyberstorm  MkIII @{UB} and  @{B}Cyberstorm  PPC@{UB}
Accelerators.  And  yes,  it's  true:  This  powerful add-on will cost the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
users, who decide to buy the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}board, not a single Cent more than
we have announced on @{I}March 19, 1999@{UI}.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{U}Dealer inquiries Welcome!@{UU}

Dealer  inquiries  for  the  @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}board are welcome. We are happy to
take pre-orders from dealers and distributors, as well as OEMs and VARs all over
the  world,  who  can  show their support for the @{B}Amiga @{UB}with such preorders, and
prepare  for  future  business.  Dealers  will  receive a common discount on the
regular  list price of the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}board, when placing preorders at the
listed  preorder  conditions.  If  you  are  a  dealer/OEM/VAR and want to place
orders,  don't  hesitate:  simply enter your customer number, select "dealer" on
the order form, and enter the quantity of @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}boards you would like
to purchase in the comments field. We'll get back to you with the pricing we can
offer you, depending on the quantity.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now  here  are some answers to typical questions (or concerns) that we have seen
in the past days:

  * @{I}Why do you need so many preorders (which you may not get)?@{UI}

    The quantity of 1,000 perorders is important to justify the investments into
    this  new  product.  It  must  not  be  underestimated  how  much technology
    knowledge  is necessary to realize it on our side. But there is also another
    important  factor,  which  we  have considered: Once the project starts with
    1,000  secured  sales,  it provides the security of a minimum installed user
    base for developers. We doubt that developers would like to start optimizing
    software for a base of several hundred users only.

  * @{I}Why don't you offer cheaper versions with slower processors?@{UI}

    There are two major reasons for that:
      - Price/performance  relation:  As a large part of the cost of the product
        goes  into  the  board  logic and development cost, the use of a cheaper
        processor would not save so much. Right now, e.g. a 300MHz version would
        only  be DM 300 or 15% cheaper, but offer 25% less performance (and CPUs
        below  300MHz  are  not  longer  built  by  @{B}IBM @{UB} and  @{B}Motorola@{UB}, and will
        therefore probably not be available in the second half of the year).
      - Absolute  performance:  To  emulate @{B}68k @{UB}code at least at the performance
        level  of  appx. an @{B}68060 @{UB}(and maybe even offer improved performance for
        emulated  @{B}68k @{UB} software,  with  highly  optimized  emulators),  we  have
        evaluated  that  400MHz @{B}G3 @{UB}performance should be an entry level product.
        We  don't  want  to  offer a product which may be a drawback for current
        high-end users (please also see the next question/answer about emulation
        speed).

  * @{I}How fast will the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}operate in @{B}68k @{UB}emulation?@{UI}

    This  can  currently  only  be  estimated,  based  on  reports  of emulation
    performance  on  @{B}604e @{UB} based boards, and by evaluating emulation performance
    for  other  CPUs  on  other  @{B}G3 @{UB} based systems. Based on currently available
    benchmarks, an optimized software emulation on a 400MHz @{B}G3 @{UB}with 1MB backside
    cache  and  100MHz  SDRAM  memory (as provided by the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4@{UB}) e.g.
    compares  well  to  a  120MHz  @{B}Pentium @{UB}chip. This performance, together with
    preliminary  @{B}68k @{UB} emulator benchmarks, gives us good hope that even emulated
    @{B}68k @{UB} software  can run some 50-80% faster than a real @{B}68060@{UB}. Of course, lots
    of already existing @{B}PPC @{UB}applications will really fly on this board...

  * @{I}Why is the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}board so expensive?@{UI}

    A question we can't understand - as the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}is offered for very
    a  reasonable  price. A ZIF CPU module for the @{B}PowerMac @{UB}currently costs some
    DM  1,700  in  Germany  or US$ 800 and up in the US - and this is only a CPU
    module,  without  memory  subsystem,  @{B}PCI @{UB} bridge  and  interface,  or  @{B}SCSI@{UB}
    controller.  And  there  is  definitely  no  other  solution  for  the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
    available,  or announced right now, that would offer the same performance at
    a comparable or even lower price.

    Another  cost-reducing advantage, especially compared to other solutions, is
    that  the  user  who  purchases a @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}can sell the existing CPU
    card  on  the second-hand market, as the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}fully replaces the
    current  CPU.  By selling e.g. an existing @{B}68060 @{UB}processor card, the cost of
    upgrading  to the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}can be reduced significantly. This is not
    possible  with  solutions e.g. for the @{B}Zorro @{UB}slot, which require the @{B}68k @{UB}CPU
    and don't allow the user to sell it.

  * @{I}Can I use my @{B}CyberVisionPPC @{UB}on the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4@{UB}?@{UI}

    Likely  not.  If  someone  uses  a @{B}CyberVisionPPC@{UB}, he also owns a @{B}Cyberstorm
    MkIII @{UB} or  @{B}PPC@{UB}.  We  recommend  in  such  a  case to sell the @{B}CyberVisionPPC@{UB}
    together with the @{B}Cyberstorm Mk III @{UB}or @{B}PPC@{UB}, when upgrading to the @{B}Cyberstorm
    G3@{UB}/@{B}G4@{UB}.  With  the  prices of new 3D @{B}PCI @{UB}gfx cards as low as never before, we
    recommend  to go for a new generation gfx card then. We also encourage other
    developers (and will happily support them) to bring new technologies such as
    @{B}3Dfx Banshee@{UB}, @{B}ATI Rage 128@{UB}, or others to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

  * @{I}Why don't you built an @{B}1200 @{UB}board?@{UI}

    There  are  too  many  technical  restrictions on such a product, because of
    which  a  development does not make sense. It must also be noted that such a
    product  would  require  a  tower case with a stronger power supply at least
    (there  is  no  chance  to  design  it  to fit into @{B}A1200 @{UB}desktops). We will
    discuss  with manufacturers of tower cases, if e.g. a simple and inexpensive
    interface  between  the @{B}A1200 @{UB}slot and the @{B}A4000 @{UB}compatible CPU connector on
    the  @{B}Cyberstorm  G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB} can  be  realized (as already available as a part of
    @{B}Zorro-III @{UB} expansion  boards).  With  such  a solution, the @{B}Cyberstorm G3@{UB}/@{B}G4@{UB}
    could be used in @{B}A1200 @{UB}tower systems without significant additional costs.

  * @{I}Why don't you build a complete new system?@{UI}

    There  are  several  issues  which would need to be resolved before we could
    decide  to  built such a system. Just to mention two major factors, we would
    need
      - full support for such a project by @{B}Amiga, Inc.@{UB}
      - a  demand  strong  enough  to  sell  3,000-5,000  units of a stand-alone
        system.
    It  might  be  a  project  for  the  future,  but  yet  we  can't say if the
    circumstances will allow us to go for such a development.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That's  it  for today. If these informations and the specification update answer
your  questions,  and  have  convinced  you  to participate in this exciting new
development project, then go ahead and @{B}PLACE YOUR CYBERSTORM G3/G4 PREORDER NOW!@{UB}

@{B}PHASE 5 DIGITAL PRODUCTS @{UB}INTRODUCES THE @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Oberursel,  March  19,  1999:  Once  again  @{B}phase 5 digital products @{UB}is happy to
announce  a  groundbreaking  new development, which will represent an extract of
@{B}phase 5@{UB}'s leading-edge technologies and the many years of expertise in designing
upgrade  products  for  @{B}Amiga @{UB} computers.  After  a  long time of evaluating the
market,  we  have  decided  to  support the existing @{B}Amiga @{UB}user base and the new
developments  at  @{B}Amiga  Inc. @{UB} with  a next generation product, which will offer
highest  performance,  future  compatibility and a bridge to industry standards.
This  product  will  be  a powerful @{B}PPC @{UB}accelerator for @{B}A3000@{UB}/@{B}A4000 @{UB}systems (and
other @{B}Amiga @{UB}systems expanded with an @{B}A4000 @{UB}compatible CPU slot) and the upcoming
@{B}Amiga OS 3.5@{UB}, as well as future versions of the @{B}Amiga OS@{UB}.

The  new  accelerator,  the  @{B}CYBERSTORM  G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB} board,  is  a pure @{B}PowerPC@{UB}-based
processor  card.  It  will  ship  with a fast @{B}PowerPC750 @{UB}or @{B}PowerPC7400 @{UB}(@{B}G4 @{UB}with
@{B}Altivec@{UB}), which is installed in a @{B}ZIF @{UB}socket. This @{B}ZIF @{UB}socket is fully compliant
with  the  @{B}Interposer @{UB} standard  from  @{B}IBM @{UB} and  @{B}Motorola@{UB}, which is also used in
@{B}PowerMac@{UB}s  and other systems, what will allow easy upgrading, if required by the
user  in  the future. In the base version with a 400MHz @{B}PowerPC750 @{UB}processor and
1MB  backside  Cache  @  200MHz, the @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}will provide an impressing
peak  performance of up to 19.2 SPECint95 and 13.1 SPECfp95 (source: @{B}IBM @{UB}website
03/18/99).  In  real-world  applications,  this  allows  incredible  application
performance, which is estimated to reach 15 -20 times the performance of a 50MHz
@{B}68060 @{UB} processor  (with native @{B}PowerPC @{UB}coded or @{B}PowerPC @{UB}optimized applications).
The @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}will use standard @{B}SDRAM @{UB}running at 100MHz, providing a peak
memory transfer rate of 582 MB/s, and has two @{B}DIMM @{UB}sockets which will support up
to  1 GB main memory. An on-board @{B}PCI 2.1 @{UB}interface will allow the connection of
all  kind  of  industry  standard devices and cards. The on-board @{B}Flash ROM @{UB}with
512kB  size  can  be  used  to install software necessary for system-startup and
other  functionalities.  By  default,  this  @{B}Flash ROM @{UB}will only contain a basic
boot-strap  functionality (hardware write protected) which will allow to install
any  kind  of  system  software  from  disks;  this  functionality will be fully
documented and freely available to everybody.

By it's design concept, the @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}is the perfect solution for running
native @{B}PowerPC @{UB}coded Operating Systems as well as emulated @{B}68k OS @{UB}segments. As a
processor  card which fits into the @{B}A4000 @{UB}compatible fast slot, it allows to run
100%   native  @{B}PowerPC @{UB} code,  and  has  full  access  to  all  system  hardware
functionalities  and  interrupts which is not the case with add-ons that are not
installed  in  the  fast slot, but e.g. in a @{B}Zorro @{UB}slot. With it's ability to be
the  master  system  CPU,  the  @{B}PowerPC @{UB}on the @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}does not need an
additional  @{B}68k @{UB} processor  which  is  the  case  in  other  designs. Beside the
technical advantages of this approach, it offers the user the opportunity to e g
sell  an  existing @{B}68060 @{UB}processor card in the second-hand market, thus lowering
the cost of the upgrade to the @{B}PowerPC G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}generation.

@{B}phase  5  digital  products @{UB} will  NOT built or deliver any software or hardware
add-ons  for  the  @{B}CYBERSTORM  G3@{UB}/@{B}G4@{UB}. The @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}will be open to third
party developers in a wide way:
  * Software  support will be realized with the new developments from @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB}
    and  @{B}Haage&Partner@{UB},  especially  with  the upcoming @{B}Amiga OS3.5 @{UB}with @{B}PowerPC@{UB}
    support,  and  upcoming  @{B}68k @{UB}emulator products. Additionally, the @{B}CYBERSTORM
    G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB} is perfectly suited for the implementation of other Operating Systems
    such as @{B}Linux@{UB}, which have already been realized on earlier @{B}PowerUp @{UB}boards.
  * For   hardware  add-ons,  the  implemented  @{B}PCI  2.1 @{UB} interface  will  allow
    third-party  vendors to design @{B}PCI @{UB}bus backplanes, and write drivers for any
    common  @{B}PCI @{UB} card  on  the  market. The interface is implemented as a single
    connector,  to  which  other  vendors  can  connects  e.g.  @{B}PCI @{UB}cards or @{B}PCI@{UB}
    backplanes, or design a physical link to @{B}PCI @{UB}slots on bus expansion boards.

However,  due  to the current market status, we can only justify the realization
of  this  project with a significant number of preorders. We will therefore have
to  collect  a  total  of  1,000  orders  from customers (end users, dealers, or
distributors).  For each of these orders, we will also ask for a down-payment of
DM  250,  which  will  be  collected  on  a notary account and will only be made
available  to  us  at  the  time  we deliver the @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}product to the
customers. This gives security to all customers who want to support this exiting
new  project  and  get stunning @{B}G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}performance for their @{B}Amiga@{UB}, and will give
security to us when we make the necessary investments.
@{I}What will be the cost of this product, and are there benefits for preordering?@{UI}

The regular list price for the @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4@{UB}, including
  * the  @{B}CYBERSTORM  G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB} mainboard  with  an  @{B}Interposer ZIF @{UB}socket for @{B}G3@{UB}/@{B}G4@{UB}
    processor  modules, 2 SDRAM DIMM sockets for up to 1 GB memory, 512 kB @{B}Flash
    ROM @{UB} for  system  software  (system software not provided with the board), a
    fully  implemented  @{B}PCI 2.1 @{UB}interface with one connector (for @{B}PCI @{UB}backplanes
    provided by third party vendors)
  * one  @{B}G3 @{UB}CPU module, with a @{B}PowerPC750 @{UB}processor with 400MHz and one Megabyte
    Backside Cache with 200MHz clock rate
will  be  DM  1,995  plus  local taxes (in Germany: DM 2.299,- incl. MwSt). This
price is based on the current price projections for components and parts for the
3rd quarter 1999, and will be updated whenever major components such as the CPUs
fall in price.

A  price  for  a  @{B}CYBERSTORM  G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}model with the new @{B}XPC7400 @{UB}(@{B}G4 @{UB}with @{B}Altivec@{UB})
processor  is  not  yet  determined, and will depend on the pricing of these new
processors.  As  soon  as we have these pricings, we will determine a list price
for this product.

For those Amigans who are ready to support this major technological step forward
by placing one of the necessary preorders, we offer a special benefit: Customers
who  are  ready  to  order  this  board  in advance, at the conditions mentioned
herein,  will  get this stunning product for a special discounted preorder price
of  DM  1,750  plus  local  taxes, including world-wide free delivery by economy
postal  service.  And  even  more:  If  the  regular list price drops before the
preordered  @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}boards start to ship, the discounted preorder price
will be reduced by the same amount.

@{I}How will the whole project proceed, and be finalized?@{UI}

First  of  all,  we  will  now  be  looking forward to the response of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community  to  this project. The basic concepts of the @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4@{UB}, as well
as  major  parts of the design (such as the @{B}SDRAM @{UB}controller and the @{B}PCI @{UB}bridge)
have  been  developed  at  @{B}phase  5  digital  products @{UB} during the past year, as
building  blocks  of other projects that we are working on; in other words, most
of the product is already "in the drawer". From the day we can make the decision
to  start  the  project  finalization, we estimate roughly four months until the
product  can  be  shipped  to  the  customers. Therefore, the shipping date will
largely depend on the time which we need to collect the preorders.

The project has four stages:
  * @{I}Announcement and preorder phase.@{UI}

    We  now  collect  preorders  from  customers all over the world. Please only
    place  a  preorder  -  which  is not yet legally binding - if you are really
    ready  to  buy  the  @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4@{UB}, and if you are ready to later pay the
    prepayment.  If many users place preorders now, but then cancel or refuse to
    prepay,  this  will  hurt  the  project  flow  significantly. If you are not
    definitely interested in this stunning new technology, please don't place an
    order.

  * @{I}Notification phase.@{UI}

    Once  we  have  received  the  necessary  1,000  preorders - the sooner, the
    better,  of course - we will open the notary account, and send notifications
    to  all customers which will include a proforma invoice and the terms of the
    contract,  as well as information about the usage of the prepayments. At the
    same  time,  we  will  also  release updated product information and updated
    pricing,  if  available.  All  customers will be asked to pay the prepayment
    with 3 weeks to the notary account.

    @{I}Important@{UI}:  The prepaid amounts will not become available to @{B}phase 5 digital
    products @{UB} before  we  actually  ship  the  @{B}CYBERSTORM  G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB} boards  to the
    customers  who  have  ordered.  If  we  fail to deliver the product within a
    certain   time  from  date  of  notification,  the  prepaid  money  will  be
    reimbursed. The prepaid money will not be reimbursed if the customer cancels
    his order for any reason.

  * @{I}Development phase.@{UI}

    Design  finalization  and verification, including rapid prototyping and full
    in-system  test  will require appx. 3 months. During this time, we will also
    work   in   close  contact  with  other  developers,  and  support  software
    development on the new boards.

  * @{I}Release & Shipment@{UI}

    Once  the  @{B}CYBERSTORM  G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}is released for production, we will go into the
    assembly,  and  start  to fullfill the preorders. The first boards will ship
    appx.  4  weeks  after  the  start  of  the production. We will fullfill the
    preorders  in  the  order  we  have  received  them. After the preorders are
    fullfilled,  we  will decide if we continue to built @{B}CYBERSTORM G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}boards
    for  the  regular  market,  what will depend on the market situation and the
    demand forecasts at this time.

If  you  want to take part in this stunning new development for the @{B}AMIGA@{UB}, which
finally  will bring the latest @{B}G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}technology to the @{B}AMIGA @{UB}and support the new
developments  by  @{B}AMIGA  Inc. @{UB} and  their partners, then go ahead and @{B}PLACE YOUR

NICE TO BE BACK AGAIN - BY @{I}FLEECY MOSS @{UI}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hey there 8-)

First  of  all,  apologies  for  my  long  absence.  I  have been working in the
background on @{B}Amiga @{UB}issues, and trying to stay in touch, but employment, family,
sickness  and  just  pure  plain  being knackered have kept me apart for far too
long.

I  am  writing this mail because there are some pretty horrendous rumours flying
around  about  what  I  have and have not said, about how I hate ppl, am issuing
death  threats,  will work for @{B}MS@{UB}, have breast implants, and a lot of other crap
which is fit only for a Hollywood 'D' movie.

I  am  writing  some regular columns for @{B}Amazing @{UB}now, a great magazine, that has
kindly  given  me a home, and which has brought both @{I}Fletcher Haug @{UI}and @{I}Don Hicks
@{UI}together,  two  of  the  brightest  and  best  in  @{B}Amiga  @{UB}journalism. We are all
determined  to  provide  the  best  possible home for the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community, past,
present  and  future,  or at least to the US portion of the community - until we
get foreign distributors anyway.

I  have  a  big article coming up about my thoughts re the @{I}Collas @{UI}PR, so I don't
want  to  reveal  too  much,  but  hearing that I had made death threats against
Schindler has sort of forced my hand.

For the record

  * I am ECSTATIC that @{I}Collas @{UI}has taken charge. To me it shows
      - that @{B}Gateway @{UB}have finally gotten serious about the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
      - that @{B}Amiga @{UB}now has a very talented leader with a proven track record for
        getting  things  done.  He  brings experience, industry wide respect and
        contacts,  and a direct line to the very top of @{B}Gateway@{UB}, because that is
        were he has been for the past few years.
    It  is great news that @{I}Havemose @{UI}has been taken on. He is a very talented and
    determined task manager and once things start moving, he is exactly the sort
    of person I would chose to run and push a technical project team.

  * I  would  like  to  see  a  public announcement about and commitment to @{I}Bill
    McEwen@{UI}. Whilst not coming from the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community, he has worked tirelessly
    behind the scenes to promote and inform the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community, irrespective of
    how  the  @{B}Amiga  @{UB}community  may  have received the end result. A few ppl are
    pissed  at  @{I}Bill@{UI},  but you should never shoot the postman when he brings you
    bad news, or worse, no news.

  * The  announcement  is  a  start. It does make vague cotton wool promises but
    also promises 2 products. I hope that after the empty promises of the last 2
    years,  @{I}Collas  @{UI}understands that if he says there will be product, there had
    better  be  product.  I  also  caution  the  community,  and  this is just a
    reiteration of what many have said since the term Digital Convergence raised
    its  head, that @{B}Amiga Inc @{UB}may not, and do not have to go in a direction that
    the  community  requires.  Like  it or not (and I do), there is a revolution
    coming  in  digital  information markets, and that is where @{B}Amiga Inc @{UB}should
    head, to give @{B}Amiga @{UB}the success it finally deserves. If @{B}Collas@{UB}'s strategy is
    one  of  produce and licence, then hopefully, there will be big opportunites
    for  third  parties  to  target  the many markets our community can provide,
    whether  Hardware,  with  @{B}Index@{UB}, @{B}DKB@{UB}, @{B}Metabox@{UB}, @{B}ACT@{UB}, @{B}Villagetronic @{UB}and @{B}P5@{UB}, or
    SW,   with   @{I}Paul   Nolan@{UI},   @{B}H&P@{UB},   @{B}NordicGlobal@{UB},  @{B}Finale@{UB},  @{B}Amitrix@{UB},  @{B}Vapor@{UB},
    @{B}Omnipresence@{UB},  @{B}Thule@{UB},  @{B}Digita@{UB},  @{B}Final Writer@{UB}, @{B}Cloanto@{UB}, the hundreds of games
    developers,  the thousands of shareware. We have a new man, one I have a lot
    of faith in, and respect for - of course, only time will tell - as always.

  * @{I}Schindler@{UI}. I have no personal issues with @{I}Schindler@{UI}. I had a lot of fun with
    him.  He  has  a great wife and kids and really is a nice guy. Ppl can, have
    and  will  make their own judgements relating to the efforts of the last two
    years,  his  performance  and business acumen. @{I}Collas @{UI}hasn't got where he is
    today  without  being  a good judge of character, and if he is the new boss,
    then  he  will make the calls as he sees them. My position is already known.
    However,  the  @{B}Amiga  @{UB}has  always  been, and rightly so, bigger than any one
    person.  We  need  to look to the future, ensure that @{I}Collas @{UI}knows the views
    and opinions of the community, and that we come to work together. Anyone who
    say  him  at  the press conference in London knows that he is a man who will
    talk,  will listen and will rethink his position. This is a man with whom we
    can  hopefully do business. There is a lot of anger at how the community has
    been  treated  but  we  have  to  make  sure we don't blow an opportunity to
    influence  the  future by continuing to stay angry. @{I}Collas @{UI}could have stayed
    more  than  comfortably off at the highest level of @{B}Gateway@{UB}, but he has seen
    something  worth pursuing. We have to make sure that he has the good company
    of the community along with him.

  * @{I}McEwen  @{UI}and  I  are  not  getting  married. Despite my fondness for "Nuclear
    wings"  @{I}Bill@{UI},  I am too fond of @{I}Elspeth @{UI}and the kids. Getting to know him is
    one  of  the  best  things  that  happened to me at @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}, and the @{B}Amiga
    @{UB}community  has  a  real  friend  in  him.  Hell, he is so much a part of the
    community  that @{I}Cooksey @{UI}has sent him over 100 mails - if that isn't official
    membership material, then I don't know what is.

In  short,  I  am very happy that @{I}Collas @{UI}is now in charge, @{I}Havemose @{UI}is full time
and  we  finally  have some momentum. St Louis will be a big test, and I hope we
will not have a repeat of the "no news" of the past. There are many issues to be
resolved,  the  status  of  the  classic,  developer  support,  user evangelism,
strategic and product partners, licencing, how @{B}QNX @{UB}fits into the picture

these  are  issues  that  have  been  waiting 2 years to be solved, I sense that
someone  as  smart  as  @{I}Collas @{UI}has proved himself to be in the past will address
them all, and more.

For  the  first  time  in  a long time I think there may be a final crack in the
darkness that has surrounded us for the past five years.

.....and if any wacky rumours start flying, please just ask me.

Don't  forget,  to  see  my  full  feelings  about the @{I}Collas @{UI}PR, @{I}McEwen@{UI}'s brief
flirtation  with wigs, the future, plus @{I}Fletcher @{UI}"Are you looking at me?" @{I}Haug@{UI}'s
incisive  editorial  and  Uncle @{I}Don@{UI}'s view of the new faces at @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}, steal,
teleport,  smuggle,  swim  the  Atlantic, or simply buy @{B}Amazing Amiga@{UB}... because
@{B}Amazing @{UB}ppl write for it, and @{B}Amazing @{UB}ppl read it.

...now  I couldn't have made that last line up if I drank American beer, could I
;-)

Have a nice K 8-)
