This is the June 1995 edition of Run AMUC.

Run AMUC is the paper newsletter of the Amiga Users of Calgary in
Alberta, Canada, and is issued on a monthly basis.  Its compatriot
newsletter is disk based on holds a lot of stuff that wouldn't fit
on here.  It's a two disk job and appears every month.

The newsletter is designed to fit two pages onto a standard 8.5 by 11
page.  Since ProPage doesn't do that I had to kludge it by printing
each page to an Postscript file and then reimport those files back
into another document with the appropriate page layout.  If you don't
have postscript, sorry...  The file is called MRALayout.PPage and
ought to work for all 12 page Run AMUCs.  This file contains the 
individual pages in EPS format so  you can for example print a nicely 
formed RA out of PageStream.  You'll still need a Postscript output 
device though.

AMUC is a non-profit enthusiasts' organisation dealing with the Commodore
Amiga line of computers.  We are not associated with CBM in any way,
shape or form.  Currently we're one of the largest and most active 
User groups in North America.  One year subscriptions vary depending
on whether you live in Calgary ($30 p.a.), want the newsletter disks
mailed to you within Canada ($45 p.a.) or want the newsletter disks
mailed to you outside of Canada ($55 p.a.).  You also get bonus
deals like half price off club ventures such as the AMUC CD-ROM.
We run a bulletin board, AMUC Express, which runs custom written
GUI based BBS software, has a six CD-changer, lots of harddisk space
(a few gigabytes at the last count) and seven lines so you can actually
log on.  It's at 284-5624, 282-5224, 289-1794, 289-1882, 282-5238, 282-5171 
and 282-5137.  Calgary is area code 403.
