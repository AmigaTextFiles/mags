A few notes about SHOAH.s,

You will need AmigaGuide ( Or Multiview on WB3 machines ) to view it properly
, which I haven't included on the disk because I don't have a license for it.
 ( I'm not sure if you do need a license for it on a PD product, but it's
                      better to be safe than sorry )
There is enough room on disk for it and the icon is set up to use it as a tool
                                   type.

 All the utilities are in lha format, but lha isn't included on this disk
( You SHOULD have a copy of it somewhere, have a look on your coverdisks ).
I'm also not going to explain how to use it, if you can't manage it then you
    should really think twice about learning assembler at this stage !

If you are putting this onto hard disk then make a directory called SHOAH.s
                              and assign it.

All the source works on Devpac, I can't vouch for other assemblers, but they
                       are all pretty much the same.

There may be one or two naughty words. If you are offended by that type of
thing then don't even load it, just format this disk now...
