Bits, bytes, words and longwords.

Bit.
	A bit is the smallest digit money can buy, I'll use a @{"Binary" link SHOAH.s:text/Numbers/MAIN} number
	to explain it ( Now we're all old pros at this binary game ).

	%01110111

	Each digit ( ie each 0 and 1 ) is a bit.

Byte.
	A byte is a collection of bits, 8 to be exact ( Thats why old 
	computers are known as 8bits, they could only handle a byte of data
	at a time ). A byte can hold a value between 0-255.

Word.
	This is two bytes "stuck" together, and is a 16bit number ( Thats why
	old Amigas are 16bit machines, like the MegaDrive and SNES ). A Word
	can handle a value of 0-65536.

Longword.
	I hope you've worked this one out all ready, 2 words stuck together,
	ie 32bits ( Now you know why it's called the CD32 ). It can handle
	a value between 0-and something huge ! ( 4294967295 to be fussy ).

And thats just about all you need to know about memory names.
