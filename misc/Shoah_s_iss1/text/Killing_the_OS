Killing the OS.

To write that compitition winning demo you're going to have to write directly
to the hardware. Now the problem with the Amiga being so nice is that it
multitasks, which is great for reading AmigaGuide documents, but a real pain
in the arse when you want to do flashy effects. So to avoid a load of hassle
and to give your fractal mapped vector routine more CPU time you need to get
rid of that cheesy Operating System,

A few points about the source...
You'll need the include files, I don't think I'm allowed to spread them, but
if you own Devpac ( And some C compilers ? ) then you'll have them all ready.
( The Jan. issue of Amiga Shopper has a demo of Devpac 3 on the coverdisk,
which has all the include files ( I think so anyway ))

This startup routine was coded by CJ/SAE and I added bits from various other
coders, ie Shagratt/LSD and some other guys. I don't claim any credit for the
above source, I've got very little to do with it.

The next issue will have better memory reading, eg total free etc.

Don't worry if you don't understand it, it's not important ! Just make sure
you use it ( It's the best way I've seen to set things up ).

Right to use the source, start your code with...

Start:
	bsr.s	TakeSystem		;Kill the OS
	tst	d0			;Did we have an error ?
	bne.s	Error			;Yes, so quit

	bsr	Do_your_funky_code

	bsr	RestoreSystem		;Finished, so restore the OS

	moveq.l	#0,d0			;Keep Mr.CLI happy
