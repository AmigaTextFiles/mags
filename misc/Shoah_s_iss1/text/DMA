DMA.

Direct Memory Access ( DMA ) is something which makes coding on the Amiga
such a joy, God I love it, I do it all the time, I like to take my pants off
and tape up the cat and... oh nothing.
Basically DMA lets the computer do stuff without using the CPU, ie you don't
really have to bother that much about sprites/sound/bobs etc., you just tell
the hardware what you want, and he'll go away and do it all for you, 'cause
he's a nice bloke.

The DMA has six different channels, which look after Audio, Disk, Sprite,
Blitter, Copper and Bitplane, and to use it...

DMACON $dff096 and can be read from DMACONR $dff002 ( ALL hardware registers
are either read or write or strobe only )

DMACON :-
Bit		Name
 0		Audio Channel 0
 1		Audio Channel 1
 2		Audio Channel 2
 3		Audio Channel 3
 4		Disk DMA
 5		Sprite DMA
 6		Blitter DMA
 7		Copper DMA
 8		Bitplane DMA
 9		DMAEnable - This bit must be set to turn on any DMA channels
 10		BLTPRI - If set, the blitter goes into nasty mode
 11		UNUSED
 12		UNUSED
 13		BZERO ( Read only ! ) - For the blitter
 14		BBUSY ( Read only ! ) - For the blitter
 15		Set/Clear bits

Bit 15 is funny, in that if you want to set any of the other bits this bit
must be set to 1, and 0 if you want to turn channels off ( ??? ),eg

	move	#%1000001010000000,$dff096	;Turn the copper ( And DMA-
						;Enable ) on
or
	move	#%0000000010000000,$dff096	;Turn the copper off

And thats it really.
