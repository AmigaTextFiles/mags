Colours.

Now, if you're writing Alien Breed III then you'll want to alter the colours,
and to do that you'll need to know that the colour hardware registers are...

	$df0180		;Colour 0
	$df0182		;Colour 1
	...
	$df01be		;Colour 31

But what values do you shove in there ? Well load DPaint and pick the palette
requestor. What value is white ? and what value is black ?

	15 15 15	;White
	 0  0  0	;Black

so in hex,
	$fff		;White
	$000		;Black

Now the colour values are worked out from the headings RGB, so
	R G B
	f f f		;White
	0 0 0		;Black

Therefore bright blue is,
	R G B
	0 0 f

Simple ? Now the colours take up a word, so blue is
	$000f
You don't use the top few bits, so just set them to 0, ie
	$0fff

And thats all there is to it, you can now go and learn about the copper with
pride and a big grin on your face...
