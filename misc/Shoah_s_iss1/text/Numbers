Number systems, yawn, yawn.

Ok, we all understand that decimal is a number system, yeah ? 100s 10s units
etc. Well just to make that little bit harder you're going to have to 
understand another two number systems !

Binary.
	Where as decimal has 10 different characters, 0-9, binary only has 2!
	Yep, just 0-1. Easy ? Well not until you can get your brain around
	the idea, so here's a little example...

	%01100101	( Always use a "%" symbol to show that it's binary )

	Now, with decimal you use the headings...

	1000	100	10	0

	But with binary you use these headings...

	128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1

	So lets convert the above number...

	128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
	---------------------------------------------------------
	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1

	So from here you just add them up, ie 64+32+4+1 = 101, not too hard
	really.

Hex.
	Now things go a bit mental, we go from a decimal base 10 to a base 16
	hexadecimal number ( 0-f ).

	f   e   d   c   b   a   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1

	So $0f ( A "$" symbol means it's a hex number ) = 15 in decimal, and
	$0a = 10, fairly simple so far...

	Let's convert $8c into decimal, oh poo this one looks a bit tricky.

	Start off by splitting the number up, ie $8 and $c, so $8 = 8 and
	$c = 12, fine so far ( I hope ).

	Now,'cause the $8 is the highest digit we multiply it by the base,
	which is 16 so 8*16 = 128, and then we add 12 ( $c ) to it and slap
	my thigh if it isn't 140. Wasn't too painful now was it, OK work
	out $02fa...

	$2 = 2, $f = 15 and $a = 10, so

	2 * (16^2) + 15 * (16^1) + 10,
	512        + 240         + 10,
	762

	Now, what's all this ^2 jazz then ? well "^" means to "the power of"
	which in this case is 2 ( I bet you wished you'd listened in all
	those boring maths lessons now, well p'rhaps not ), but why ? It's
	because the highest digit is now the 3rd one across, so if we had the
	number $71b4f you would work out the highest digit by,

	7 * (16^4),

Octal.
	Another number system, well sort of, it's base 8 and is hardly ever
	used, ever. I just thought I'd mention it for completness.

Right, a slight confession now, in the real world you'll hardly ever have to
calculate different number systems, you'll use a software calculator such
as Procalc. I've covered the number systems 'cause you have to understand the
theory.
