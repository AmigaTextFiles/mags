What are Labels ?

This is a method for giving a memory location a name, to make life easier.
To show you what I mean here's a short BASIC program,

10	Print	"SHOAH excites me in ways I can't explain"
20	Goto	10

In the example the line numbers ( 10,20 ) are labels.

Example Labels.
Start:	move.b	#10,d0
Test:	dc.b	$2a
text:	dc.b	"Boring scroll text",0

You don't have to put a : after a label, it just makes your source code
neater.

Local Labels.
These are slightly different from normal labels, basically it saves you
thinking up lots of different names. A local label always starts with a . and
you must have a normal ( Global ) label before it, eg
Start:
	...
.loop	...
	...
Next_Routine:
	...
.loop	...
	...

Don't put a : after a local label !

Bad examples of labels.
1loop	 <----	You can't start a label with a number
loop$	 <----	You can't put $,%,# or any maths symbols in labels
FFlp1	 <----	What the hell does that stand for ? Use meaningful names !
bum head <----	Don't put a space in there, use a _ instead

Check your assembler documentation for more information about labels.
