Plasma.

I DIDN'T write the code, I just set it up the way I like it and made it work
on a A1200 without having to use Run12 or some other degrader. The brief doc
below was written by the coder, Rene Olsthoorn, sorry I've not got a better
tutorial to go with this but the source is quite straight forward to follow,
have fun...

First of all,try other value's on fvert,qhor,qvert,fhor. different plasma !!
You can see,that the horizontal distance between two colors is eight pixels. 
As you may know,that's the minimum distance between two copper-colors. But 
how can you move all the colors 56 horizontal pixels ?? -> solution:

- You need 4 bitplane's.

plasmaline(this line is important):
 dc.l $00ff00ff,$ff00ff00,$00ff00ff,$ff00ff00

bitpl1: plasmaline
bitpl2: plasmaline+2 + shifted 8 pixels to the right
bitpl3: plasmaline+2
bitpl4: plasmaline+4 + shifted 8 pixels to the right

So,
bpl1: dc.l $00ff00ffff00ff0000 ff00ffff00ff0000 ff00ffff00ff0000
bpl2: dc.l $--00ffff00ff0000ff 00ffff00ff0000ff 00ffff00ff0000
bpl3: dc.l $00ffff00ff0000ff00 ffff00ff0000ff00 ffff00ff0000
bpl4: dc.l $--ff00ff0000ff00ff ff00ff0000ff00ff ff00ff0000
            | | | | | | | | |  | | | | | | | |
color-      --  06  05  09  10   06  05  09  10
register.     13  11  02  04   13  11  02  04

You put the registervalue's(example: 13=$198) into the copperlist under the 
bitplane.
          (1)  56 pixels 
bitplane:  X <----------->

copper:    X , , , , , , X
          (2)           (3)

(1)= bitplane combination for color13.
(2)= copper instruction that defines color13.
(3)= also copper instr.that def.color13,but 64 pixels away from (2).

Now,you can shift the bitplane 56 pixels,and the colors wont't change.
Are you shifting more than 56 pixels then the bitplane combination will
take(ofcourse) the color of the new defined color13 (3),and the color 
changes.

Ofcourse I shifted the lines with the blitter. I also used the blitter for 
putting the colors into the copperlist. load the green-bar into A,red in B
,and blue in C. Put them together into D with all the minterms on,except the
one where all the bits are zero.

By the way:you can easily make a much nicer plasma,if you make the sinus much
bigger,but it still must go from 0 to 56. And you can put diffent value's 
into the fvertx(sinus frequenty) and qvertx(speed of sinus).
The vertical sinus has got no limitations,so you can make a sinus for it
that goes further than 56 pixels.
