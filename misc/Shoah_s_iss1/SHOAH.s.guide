Hello,
     Welcome to the very first issue of SHOAH.s, and I'd like to start off by
stressing a few points, so here we go...

	1. I don't think of myself as some type of hot shit programmer, quite
           the opposite. I'm not doing this as some type of ego boost or any
           crap like that, I just felt that there was a need for something
           like this which was in the PD.
	2. Those of you who have seen "The Source" may think I'm just ripping
           off their idea, but the format of this was planned to be very
           different, more like Grapevine/Raw etc., but time was agaisnt me
           so I opted for AmigaGuide ( Anyone fancy coding a nice front end ?
           ). Also, this is aimed mainly at beginners, whereas 50% of the
	   stuff in The Source goes right over my head ! ( I'm not knocking
	   it, far from it, but I feel that this guide is aimed towards a
	   totally different audience ). I hope I haven't stepped on too many
	   toes.
	3. I hope anyone whose work is in here dosen't mind, I assume that if
	   the actual source is available then it is for spreading purposes.
	   If I'm wrong then please contact me and I'll remove it and say a
	   very large sorry.

Right, that's that off my chest. I hope this, erm, thing is some use to some-
body out there, and hopefully I'll get enough contributions to keep this lark
going ( I'd like this series to build into something really useful, and I
can't do that on my own ! So please send in some source and/or tutorials ).
	I've made every effort to make sure everything works, it all works
fine on my A1200 and that is now the base Amiga, so if some things don't work
on older machines, then sorry. Also, if I've got anything wrong, then sorry
( Please write in to correct me ), but I have checked everything a million
times ( Well, twice ).
	If you use some of this source in your own productions then please
remember to credit the author, it is only fair.
	That's about it really, the next issue will be out on the 1st March,
( Which will include more AGA stuff ( Mainly about palette selection, and the
new larger sprite modes )),although that depends on contributions, ie if I
don't get any then it'll be out a loooonnnnng time after, so I'll bore you
then...

					Squize.

P.S. I big thank you goes to everyone whose work is included in here, in one
form or another, without who...
P.P.S. Thanks go to \/E>< for all the ASCII things...

@Node "Assembler"
Assembler notes

I've used Devpac V3 to test all the source in this issue, with 2.04 includes.
The source should also hopefully work on most other assemblers without too
                             much alteration.
If you don't have a copy of Devpac 3 then you should have a look through the
back issues of Amiga Shopper, 'cause they recently gave away a copy of Devpac
  3.1 Lite on the coverdisk, which is well worth getting if you are just
  starting off and don't want to splash out a load of money for the full 
           version, or if you just need the 2.04 include files.

@Node "Distribution"
Nothing too heavy here...

   This production is PD, and no more than 1:50 may be charged for it's
 distribution. Any PD library charging more will be blacklisted from stocking
                      any further SHOAH productions.

This package may not be altered in any way, all the files must be spread with
     it ( Although of course you can rip source files all you like ).

I, or any of the authors, cannot guarantee that any article is error free,
               blah,blah use it at your own risk etc., etc.

@Node "Contributions"
Contributions

I really can't stress enough how important your contributions are, without
them this thing won't be going for very much longer...

A few points...

 Don't worry if your not in a big name group or any of that jazz, if you've
  written anything then send it in, you may think it's crap but someone will
  find it useful.
 Tutorials are just as welcome as source, both together would be great !
 Please don't send a load of graphix/big mods with your contribution unless
  it's totally necessary.

As soon as the next issue is finished I'll send you it on your disk ( So that
     should be an influence to send in fairly good quality disks ! ).

Any comments or letters are most welcome, even if it's to say how crap this
                                  all is.

Also, if you have improved any of the source in this issue then send that in,
           I'd rather have forty vector routines than nothing !

Here's the all important address...

			     SHOAH,
			     38 Oxstalls Way,
			     Longlevens,
			     Gloucester.
			     GL2 9JQ.

or you can E-mail \/E>< at...

			    CM3BCAJ@STAFFS.AC.UK

( Although any replies from me will take a couple of weeks I'm afraid, 'cause
                I still have to use good old Royal Mail ! )

And thanks in advance...

@Node "Future"
Future things...

I don't know about you lot, but there are loads of little routines I want to
find out about, so if there is anything you want to learn about then write in
and hopefully someone out there will be able to answer it for us ! ( If you
are thinking of contributing something towards this guide then please have a
                   look through here for some ideas ! )

How to read the CD joypad.

How to write Non-Dos disk loaders.

Someone fancy explaining IRQs to the masses ?

Little demo routines such as faders and wipes.

 So if anyone fancies explaining some of these things I'd be very grateful
                                  indeed.
