[1miBrowse Evaluation[0m

The iBrowse evaluation version has been released recently, and as such,
we've decided to give you a run down. Vapor have yet to release a free
evaluation version of Voyager, so I don't know how much they compare.
This means that I'll probably end up comparing it to Voyager 2.95,
which we reviewed last issue.

And I have to say, iBrowse compares very favourably. The dithering 
routines are the best I've ever seen, anywhere, in anything! Even on
my shoddy little 16 colour Hires:Laced screenmode, it displays photos
as if they ARE photos (apart from the person with Green arms, but I
can excuse that :)

It seems to have speeded up a lot too, and it has Javascript support,
which brings it nearly up to date. Somehow, I never imagined Amiga
browsers getting Javascript support. Not because it was too hard to
implement, or because the Amiga wasn't able to cope with it, but
just because I never saw it fitting in the with the whole Amiga
'Environment'.

But it does, and it seems to work fine for the sites I've looked at,
which is a good thing. The entire settins panel has been given a whole
makeover in this version, and it's a lot easier to use than the last
versions. It uses a nice Listview MUI Class (ListTree) which makes
a nice change to normal Listviews. Only trouble is, it's not wide enough
to fit my window font in it.

Moving back to the browser itself, you can now select the text on the
page, and much easier than Voyager 2.95 too. The only problem being with
bold and italic text, where some of the highlight is left behind, but
that's not such a major thing. Also, on closer inspection of the bundled
iBrowse pages, it seems iBrowse can now scale graphics on the fly, so
specifying width and height tags in the <IMG> tag, you can scale the
image. Good stuff.

iBrowse can spoof as Mozilla, meaning that some sites will allow iBrowse
to access them. Mozilla (essentially Netscape) is the only thing it
can spoof as though. Wouldn't it be good if it could also spoof as
Micro$oft IE? I'd quite like to see it try and handle the Microsoft
site (not a criticism of iBrowse - a criticism of the Microsoft site)

Anyway, if you haven't already got one of the new updated browsers, don't.
We hope to be able to look at Voyager 3 next time, then you can decide
what you buy :)

Anyway, the scores...
