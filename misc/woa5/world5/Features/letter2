Open Letter to the Amiga Community

There has been a great deal of confusion and frustration expressed in the
news groups and via email over the past several weeks. I apologize that we
have not been more direct in our communications, and I want to set the
record straight.

First, per my previous messages, I continue to be impressed with the
passion and commitment of this community. You have "hung in there" through
a number of upheavals over the past years, and through several false starts
on next-generation Amiga platforms. You deserve better. I have received
many, many emails over the past two weeks, expressing your opinions and
frustrations. Let me try and summarize what I have heard.

Many of you acknowledge the fact that we are focusing on software for the
coming generation of "Internet appliances." We are very excited about the
new Amiga Operating Environment, the work we are doing with Linux (and other
operating systems that support Java), and the huge growth curve in Internet
appliances that we are going to ride. You have gracefully wished us well
in this endeavor, for that, I thank you. As you know, we announced in July
that we were pursuing the development of a "multimedia convergence computer"
that would serve as the next-generation Amiga desktop computer. After the
change in management at Amiga, we reviewed all our product plans. To be
honest, the ability for us to deliver the MCC was unrealistic. Furthermore,
I have fundamentally decided that it would be better to partner with a wide
variety of hardware partners, rather than compete against them with a
product of our own.

From your perspective, one big problem exists. Sounds great, but what does
this new direction have to do with the original Amiga computer? Quite
honestly, nothing! We realize that this does not satisfy the desire of the
Amiga community for a next-generation Amiga. In response, I remain committed
to seek out partners who are interested in developing a next-generation
Amiga computer and operating system. We have been following the discussions
amongst the newly formed "Phoenix Platform Consortium" and talking to
companies interested in supplying the next-generation Amiga. We are open to
the possibility of licensing the MCC product specification and design that
is now on the shelf to companies that are interested in further developing
the Amiga desktop computer product line. We believe that this could be an
attractive business opportunity for another company.

In summary, we are continuing to focus our resources on setting software
standards for the coming generation of Internet appliances. We are not
planning to offer hardware devices, but will work with hardware manufacturers
who want to license our technology. As far as offering next-generation Amiga
systems, we are open to talking to companies who want to offer such a
product. For those of you who are excited about the Amiga Operating
Environment running on a wide variety of future Internet appliances, we
invite you to track our progress and activities over the coming months. The
Internet appliance software model that we are putting together will open
up an exciting new era of software development that we think will be very
interesting to the type of innovative thinkers who were drawn to the Amiga
computer in years past.

Best Regards,

Thomas J. Schmidt
President and CEO
Amiga, Inc.
