@node cd32 "News On CD32Bits"

From this month onwards CD32Bits will be going bi-monthly.  The move is
forced by Commodores market standing and the what can only be called a
pathetic amount of titles released for the machine.  Over the last two
months, the games industry has seemed to have stood back to wait and see
what is happening with Commodore.  As a result over the last two month
period, there have only been three games releases.  Strictly speaking, I
could still release monthly, but I see no point to do so.  If the news
isn't there, the magazine is going to be very boring.

Hopefully this will only be a temporary measure, and the CD32 will
regain some of it's lost ground from the last few months.  I have said
before that October onwards was going to be the time for the good game
releases, and to date, this situation has not changed.  Let's just hope
that the lag was due to the traditionally slow Summer period.

Due to archive size, it has been decided to not include pictures
anymore.  This matter is negotiable, so if you would like to carry on
being able to see what I am talking about, then let me know, and I will
try to accomodate.  If enough people were interested, I could do a
normal (with picures) and a Lite, (without) version of CD32Bits for each
issue.  Let me know your feelings on the subject.

If the current situation continues with Commodore, I may be forced into
changing the magazine's outlook slightly to encompass all CD format
machines.  If this happens, I will need writers for the various formats.
I would like to hear from readers with PC-CDRom, 3DO and CD-I machines
who would be interested in contributing to the magazine.

All feedback to the addresses in the Introduction please.

@node comm "Commodore Management Buyout"

The major news of the last month has been the attempted Commodore UK
Management buyout of it's parent company.  The bid was made after
combined managers from the UK, Germany and Canada formed a group and
raised the financial power to make an effective bid.  Other confirmed
bidders were Creative Equipment International, Samsung, Philips and
Amstrad.  At the time of writing there has been no official confirmation
of success on any of the groups part, but Commodore UK sent out a letter
to their developers and trade confirming their part in the buyout.  The
letter also stated that they were extremely confident that they had
succeeded with their bid, and that production of new machines and
continuation of old runs would soon commence again in time for
Christmas.  It has now been over a week since the decision date, so all
we can do is wait.  It's looking good though.
@endnode
@node ects "Report on the Autumn European Computer Trade Show"

I've just this moment got back form the ECTS..  Commodore were not
there as a company, *BUT* David Pleasance, and John Smith were there
in the restaurant, and we had a little chat!!  The Bahamian Court is still
undecided over the bid, but Pleasance is extremely confident that they have
it..  He was in a cheerful mood and joked about  the situation..  He claims
though, that if the bid is not confirmed in the next 10 days, the team will
withdraw their bid, which is very worrying..  the only other contender is
Samsung and he confirmed that they will not continue the Amiga line if they
win the bid..  They only want the technology.

CD32 and Amiga support was largely non-existent, although there were some
interesting things to be seen:-

Maxis were showing Sim City 2000 and it is absolutely amazing.  It is no
longer hard disk only, but one is needed for proper use.  It's AGA only, and
upon startup promotes to any screenmode perfectly.  It looks exactly the same
as the Mac and PC versions, and the only time you would notice any
difference is during use of the ASL file requester.  It was runnning on a
4000/030, and screen-update and magnification are much faster than the PC
version which was running along side.  A late September release is expected,
and it's going to be big.  This title will not appear on the CD32.

Mirage were still focussing their attention on Rise Of The Robots, with
versions for every format.  The game will be out in the next few weeks, and
looks awesome.  It's on 14 disks and is hard disk only.  The graphics are
every bit as good as the PeeCee version that you have  probably seen previews
of, and the animation is fluid and quick.  The control is the best I have seen
on a Miggy Beat-em-up.  The cut-down non-AGA version is almost as fast, with
less detailed backdrops.  This is going to be another major title.

The Team 17 stand had a rather interesting surprise.  They were demonstrating
Stardust and Speedpool for the CD32, and Alien Breed - Tower Assault for all
formats, BUT..  In one of the side rooms, there was a program running on an
A1200 which looked remarkedly like Doom. The game is in early stages of
development, but from what I saw, and it was only a little, it looked quite
capable of the tasks it was performing.  At this stage it is running on
two-thirds screen, but one of the staff confirmed that it would be full screen
upon release.  At the moment, it has no title, but who cares....  Everybody
said it couldn't be done, and they were wrong.  I've just seen it.

21st Century Entertainment were showing thei new game, Pinball Illusions..
It's a vast improvement on the previous versions, with multiball option and
left and right tilt ability. It's scheduled for release in November, so that's
one to look out for.  Their other demo was of the CD32 title, Marvins
Marvellous Adventure, but it was pretty run of the mill stuff.

Mindscape were showing off their Mega-Race conversions, but the CD32 one is
VERY dissapointing.  It was in 32 colours, and running between the 3DO and
Sega versions.  Out of the three, the CD32 version was the worse.  One of
their representatives tried to tell me that the Sega had similair capabilities
to the CD32, so that could be the end of such a promising title.  It was jerky,
ugly and the car was badly animated..  The worse thing was, the rep didn't say
anything to reassure me that the final version was going to be any better...

Bullfrog were encompassed into the EA stand, but there wasn't an Amiga or any
description in site.  I asked Bullfrog about this, and they said that it was
EA's decision.  Subsequently, I haven't seen Theme Park yet, although I should
be receiving a demo copy early this week.  They were also heavily pushing the
PC version of Magic Carpet.  At the moment, it's looking very impressive with
four in-game modes.  You can play normally, with a VR headset, with 3D glasses
(red and blue comp) and finally the strangest thing I have seen for ages, in RDS
mode.  Yes, you can play it like an animated stereogram!?!?!?!?  I can't see
the use, but it did work and the game wasn't too difficult to play in this
mode.

The only other big push that I could see was on Disney's part for The Lion
King.  It looks very good.  Philips were there showing the same old stuff that
they always do. Activision were still promoting PitFall 2 as at the last ECTS,
so nothing new there.  Millenium were showing their latest beat-em-up, and
Rasputin were showing of the AGA CD32 conversion of Jetstrike.  Apart from
that, there wasn't really much Amiga wise. Hopefully, the situation will be
different at the next show!

@node plea "Interview With Pleasance"

Whilst at the European Computer Trade Show on Sunday 4th September 1994, we
were lucky enough to be able to have a chat with the man behind the current
Management Buy Out attempt on Commodore International.

The setting for this was not a plush Commodore suite, but because Commodore
were not officially at the show, their business was conducted over one of the
tables in the corner of the bar.

We started by wishing him good luck with the MBO, and proceeded to ask what the
present situation was with it. We were told that although the deal had not been
finialised, they were very confident with what was happening, and an
announcement will be made within the next 2 weeks. A relaunch event for
developers and dealers has been planned for October 13th, with more details to
follow at a later date.

When questioned as too whether this would leave enough time to get machines to
the Christmas Market, he said that although they would not have the quantity
that they want, there will be machines on the shelves for Christmas. We also
discussed the complete lack of A4000's available, and he stated that this
problem would be addressed immediately the MBO has been announced, because the
A4000 is the machine in the highest demand.

The last point that was mentioned was whether or not, Amiga International
would be assisting software companies in an effort to bring some high quality
games and application software to the market. The answer to this was yes, and
to my mind this is a very encouraging statement. Commodore always lacked the
ability to see software as being essential to the success of a machine, and
this lack of quality software partially led to their downfall. If the likes of
MicroSoft were persuaded to develop software, then more and more people might
use the machine.

We had finished the chat now, but David left my gathered associates and I with
one last comment :

"Cheers lads, thanks for your support - we need it"

We can only wish him the greatest of luck, and look forward to meeting him
again on October 13th at the relaunch.

The long awaited Panasonic 3DO REAL System finally hit the UK last week,
and looks set to be a big seller.  Although sales in the US have been
far less than expected, they are starting to pick up now, with 200,000
units now sold.  The initial batch of games titles are very impressive,
and the future looks even more so.  Play Road Rash once, and you'll be
hooked.  UK prices are 400 for the player, and 40-50 for a game title.
Later in the year/early next year, the FMV expansion will be released
amd will allow 3DO onwers to watch Video CD's.  The unit will retail at
around the 200 mark, which is identical to the Commodore CD32 unit
released 8 Months Ago.  The CD32 is going to have a fight on it's hands
if good quality games do not start appearing.

                Banshee         Core Design             30

The newest game from the Core stable to grace the CD32, and can only be
described as the best shoot'em-up out for the CD32 at the moment.  It is a
clone of the old classic 1942  but has been enhanced beyond all proportions.
Single or two player options and three ways to play the game: adventure
which is the full thing, bonus and arcade both of which are training flights
to help improve your skills.  The game itself is fast and furious with
superb colours and extra sounds over the 1200 version, and of course the intro
which are just static screen shots.  There are loads of pick ups to enhance
your plane and you will need them as the enemy has its own selection of fire
power.  My recommendation is to go and buy this game, you wont be let down.

@node emer "Emerald Mines"

                Emerald Mines           Almathera               15

Emerald Mines is a massive re-releae of the old classic onto CD32 and
has literally hundreds of levels.  Emerald Mines is a maze-like romp in
which your objective is to collect the neccessary amount of crystals
needed to complete the level.  During your spree, you will come up
against a wide range of monsters whos sole purpose is to thwart your
task.

The levels range from very simple to vergeing on the impossible.  The
graphics are very basic eight bit-like attempts, but what do you expect
for 15.   If you can master the somewhat cumbersome pad conversion
control method, you may enjoy this, but it is very basic stuff and is
unlikely to hold your attention for a long period of time.

        Simon The Sorcerer              Adventure Soft          40

Who hasn't heard of Simon the Sorcerer?  It has been around on the 1200 for
some time now but has finally graced the CD32, and what can we expect?
Sampled speech and oodles of game play.  The game a point and click graphical
adventure which can only be compared to Monkey Island 2.  This game has
plenty of humour and depth to the game that will have you frustrated for days
or even weeks.  This game has an auto mapping function which helps make the
game more enjoyable to play.  This game is packed with puzzles and quips,
however there are some puzzles that are extremely abstract and may take some
time to figure out.  As for the sound there is the obligatory sound track
through out the game which varies from location to location, but it is the
sampled speech that really blows you away!  This game is really enjoyable to
play.  So is it the same as Monkey Island 2? No way! This is one large adventure
that will keep you happy for weeks.

        Fatal Attraction                Philips                 16


Michael Douglas and Glenn Close star in this erotic thriller.  In a very
similar style, Fatal Atraction was probably an influencing factor on the
92 hit Basic Instinct.

The story revolves around Douglas' character trying to distance himself
from an obsessed woman with whom he once had an affair.  Close plays the
psychotic ex-lover who will do anything to get Douglas back.  Even
murder.

The film has been encoded well, but still suffers from minor jumping on 
the CD32.  I doubt you'll watch it many times, but it's worth getting
for the sink scene!

@node sx-1 "SX-1 Review"

Finally the much awaited SX-1 module has appeared on sale, but was it worth
the wait.

For 199 you get a box that fits onto the back of the CD32 offering expansion
possibilities beyond your wildest dreams - well nearly.

The unit actually consists of a number of expansion ports

Serial - a PC AT DB9 connector.

RGB - a standard Amiga 23 pin video port allowing connection to RGB and VGA
(with the appropriate adaptor) monitors.

Parallel - a standard Amiga parallel port.

Audio In - Allows the use of audio mixing - undocumented feature
at present.

AT Keyboard - Allows connection of an AT101 key keyboard.

External & Internal IDE hard drive connectors.

Floppy - connect a standard Amiga floppy drive - recognised as df0:

SIMM connector - connect either a 1/2/4/8 Mb 32bit SIMM.

MPEG passthrough - allows the use of the C= FMV board with the SX-1



THE TESTS

Upon unpacking the SX-1 the first thing I did was to consult the manual.
This was rather a disappointment as it is merely 4 sides of A4, but it
covers the information needed to get the SX-1 up and running, albeit
slightly brief. The only real complaint with the the manual is a
reference to an appendix which contains the pin outs for the external
IDE interface, but the appendix is not included.

The first thing was to install a memory module (SIMM) and a 2.5"
Harddrive. This both went in easily, although the harddrive is mounted
underneath the pcb whereas the connector is on the reverse side. In order
to connect these a cable must be run down the side of the unit. In order
for this to be achieved, the entire unit must be removed, which is slight
tricky although not much of a problem.

I was able to connect my C= 1942 to the SX-1 and the quality was superb.
Watching FMV movies on a monitor certainly shows the quality off and
this is a very useful feature.

The manual warns that if too many units are connected the power supply
might fail, but I connected a hard drive & floppy drive and there were
no problems at all.

Functionally, the serial and parallel ports are the same as the Amigas
and I was able to ParNET to my A4000 whilst using a modem on the serial
port to download some files.

Owing to lack of documentation I was unable to test the Audio In
connector or the external IDE.


THE PROBLEMS

1) I was unable to get an AT keyboard that worked with the unit, although
I have been told by other people that there are keyboards which work.
This was not a problem to me as I used my A4000 keyboard.

2) When booting from hard disk without a floppy drive connected, a
requester appears asking for DF0:. In order to carry on booting the
requester must simply be cancelled. This is presumably a fault of the
kickstart and not the SX-1's, but Microbotics have not documented it
anywhere.


THE VERDICT

Overall this is an excellent unit offering a CD32 user the ability to
expand their unit beyond that of a 1200 and CD-ROM. Apart from the
minor problems which were probably down to it being from the first
batch, the unit is of the highest quality. Overall it should be a must
have upgrade for any CD32 owner.

@node zapp "Zappo CD-Rom Drive for the A1200"

The long awaited PCMCIA CD-Rom drive for the 1200 is finally here, but
has the hype been worth it.

Well, first impressions indicate yes.  The unit looks the part, and
seems sturdely constructed.

The first thing you notice is the fact that the Zappo is indeed a
totally rebadged Archos unit.  The case says Archos on the back of it,
the instruction manual says Archos on it, and the installation disk has
Archos all over it, so it is safe to assume that it's not a Zappo
invention!  :-)

The case doesn't totally match the A1200's colour, so looks a little out
of place.  If you take a closer look, you can see needless imperfections
like a piece of cork covering up wiring at the back, a piece of silver
paper screwed into the unit to act as an earth, and a very unstable
component on the back of the machine.  These are all external problems,
but many of you wont be bothered about these.  You want to know how the
unit functions..  Well...

The first unit I had blew up, taking the PCMCIA slot with it, which was
rather annoying to say the least.  After speaking to many people, it
appears that my unit was not the only one to have done this.  It seems
like an inherant problem.  Hopefully this matter will be rectified
before the next batch is shipped.

The second unit however performed rather better.  The installation of
the driver software is very simple, and once installed, the unit
performs as well as any normal CD-Rom drive.  Part of the software is
used to allow the booting of CD32 titles.  Upon a reset, the left mouse
button has to be held down, and a requester appears, with options to boot
from CD or to softkick in a 3.1 romfile.  I have not seen this function
working though.

When using the Boot CD option, the system seems to slow down quite a lot
disk wise, but that's no real problem.  I attempted to run all of the
titles reviewed in this issue, and they all worked apart from Simon The
Sorcerer.  Hopefully this will not be a regular problem.

Also included on the installation disk is software for playing audio
tracks and photoCD's.  Both of these are quite basic programs, but do
the job.

All in all, the Zappo unit is quite an adequate solution to the A1200
CD-Rom problem, although I would be hesitant over buying the unit until
Archos actually release theirs.  At the moment, it's release has been
held back due to some technical problems, and one would suggest that the
unit popping as above may be one of them.

@node amin "Aminet 3"

The latest release in the Aminet collection comes in two formats: Share
and Gold.  Share is the cheaper of the two, whereas Gold's price
includes a nominal amount for contribution to the administrator of
Aminet.  I very much doubt that many of the Gold disks will be sold.

For software content, the disk cannot be beaten, plus it has three
issues of CD32Bits on it!  :-)  It has a marvellous front end if you are
using it on a PCMCIA/SCSI CD Rom drive you can use an Amiga guide
interface to find the programs that you want, unpack them and view them.
It is highly likely that you can find any program on here that you would
ever need.  All you need to know is the name, then do a search.  Chances
are, the program will be there.

NB  THIS TITLE WILL NOT BOOT ON A CD32

CD32Bits Rating  *****

@node cdpd "CDPD 4"

The latest disk in the CDPD collection is rather dissapointing to say
the least.  The amount of useful, and quality software is minimal,
although there is quite a large section for Imagine users.  It has the
usual spattering of Fred Fish disks, ranging from 891 to 1000, a large
text section containing Amiga Report and UseNET postings, a few
utilities and a collection of the AMFM disks.  Naturally the disk is
ready for networking.

I suppose at 20, the disk is value for money, but I can't help thinking
that Almathera are running out of things to put on their disks.

Photolite is a purely CD based piece of PhotoCD viewing sofware for the
CD32.  It allows you to easily view and convert the high quality images
found on PhotoCD disks.

At 20, Photolite is a bargain for such a piece of software.  If you
have a CD32 and want to see your own photo's on it, this title is a
must.
