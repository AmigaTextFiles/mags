Welcome to the postscript veersion of the March 1996 issue of GAC FLAK, the Newsletter of the Gateway
Amiga Club,Inc.

This time the postscript version was done a bit differently. I decided to try the PPD file for the Adobe
Default Printer. As a result, some information may not print at the edges of the page. Let me know if this
happens. As always, let me know if you have any trouble with this archive. I will try to fix it in the
next issue.
