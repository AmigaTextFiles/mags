@{FG Shine}Welcome to AmiChannel News@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 16th issue of AmiChannel News.

While I am writing this editorial, my CD is playing "Never be the same", one of
the biggest hit by Christopher Cross. I did not known until now that the title
of the song was about the Amiga. Yes, it will be never the same for the Amiga.

Although you will find very good (and better) information about the Home
Electronics World show (former Computer show) held in Köln in the reports
included in this issue, let me focus in the people who did not attended the
show.

For the first time, no Amiga Inc. representatives attended a big Amiga show. It
was not a surprise, as they are refusing to talk the community and they do not
have any product to show (the OS35 is a H&P's and Petro's product). Talking
about the devil, Petro was there, but he was not so optimistic about the future
as usual. Probably, he is fed up of the Tom Schmidt's and others incompetence.

Something similar happened with Phase5. The Oberusel company is in trouble
because Motorola is not supplying one essential component for its G4 boards.
Are the G4 boards another hoax? Who knows.

Village Tronic was neither in the show. As you probably know, they were
developing the 3dfx module for the Picasso IV. Although not oficially, this
project has been cancelled because they failed to port Glide to the Amiga and
they do not want to put more resources to finnish the port.

And what about the Mozilla port from Free Amiga Organization? Well, forget about
it. They were unrealistic. They had the 15 minutes fame and then dissapear.

But not everything are bad news. Wipeout 2097 PPC has been released. After the
Space Station 3000 fiasco, it seemed that Digital Images were not able to
develop the first Amiga game supporting both PPCand 3d acceleration.
Fortunately, the game has been released and it is probably the best game ever
released for the Amiga. If you have PPC and 3D card, please consider buying it
becuase you will support the development of other hing end Amiga games.

Another good news is the success of the OS3.5 sales, around 6,000 last time I
heard. But if we want a PPC port, H&P needs at last 25,000 copies sold. So
please, buy it in case you have not done it before. By the way, after the
release of this issue in Aminet, I will install on my A4000. Happy installing!

                    ALIVE MEDIASOFT NEW PRODUCTS AND UPDATES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALIVE MEDIASOFT LTD. PRESS ANNOUNCEMENT 24th October 1999.

*WHALES VOYAGE 2* £19.99 /Out Mid November/

Whales Voyage 2 is a science fiction, role-playing, strategic trading game.

The story so far:

The skyboulevard, seat of government of the Raphastrasystem, has been destroyed
by the crew of the Wahle - the political system has been re-established.... 20
years later...

... the crew is forced to stay alive in the corrupt world of the 25th century
after spending their money for leisure and fun.

Whales Voyage 2 offers a lot of excitement which surpasses part one by far. From
the beginning the player gets directly involved into the highly detailed story
and can collect information to reach the "big final"

The game includes three mainparts:

   * The roleplaying game, where a party of four people move through cities or
     large towns etc, in the whole galaxy.
   * Part two is a complex trading simulation where the player is forced to make
     money to afford the equipment of the Whale and the crew.
   * Finally the game contains a strategic spacebattle where the player has to
     fight against pirate ships and other enemies.

*Technical Facts:*

The whole look of the game changed, compared with part one. A mouse control
during the game has been included in addition to the joystick/joypad steering of
part one.

The old 2d overlandsystem changed into 3d fractal landscape where you can fly
over the surface of the planets and search for mineral resources and and cities.

The music by NEO Project, who also arranged the soundtrack for Burntime and The
Clue, guarantees the atmosphere.

Whales Voyage II is not only a computer game, but there will also follow other
games:

The well known pen-and-paper roleplayingsystem of "Whales Voyage I" has been
improved and will be available in two books. A board and game and a card game
are also in development.

Whales Voyage II will be available for:

   * Amiga CD32
   * Amiga A1200/4000 CD

There is an abundance of high quality sound effects, music and of course speech.

"Whales Voyage II" will become one of the most complex games of the year, which
combines the genres roleplayinggame, tradingsimulation and strategic game.

                SOFTWAVE ANNOUNCES A NEW CD BASED AMIGA MAGAZINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Immediate Release

Napoli, Italy, 25 October 1999

Dear Amigans,

My name is Giorgio Signori, and I am the director of Softwave, a new company
born in Italy this summer. I have been writing on the only Italian Amiga
magazine, Enigma Amiga Run, in the past years, and I am in Amiga environment
since years. After years writing for Amiga, I decided to build up a new company
to publish an Amiga-only, CD-based magazine. After a lot of work, at the Amiga
show Softwave was there with the first issue of Amiga.it, showed during the
conference with Petro Tyschtschenko. After this, we decided to publish Amiga.it,
under the name Amiga.news, also outside Italy. We put much effort in this,
translating, for now, the whole magazine in English. We will show and sell the
first issue of Amiga.news at the next Home Electronics World of Cologne, on
12-14 November.

We hope that the public response will be enough to convince us to keep doing a
multi-language magazine also for the next issues. If so, since the 3rd issue, we
will translate it also in German, as many of you already requested. In the next
days in this site will be published the summary of the first issue.

But now, some of the highlights of Amiga.news:

The magazine part count many important writers here in Italy. Editors like ing.
Massimo Gais, system administrator of the Italian Aminet node and of the
Astronomic Observatory of Naples, like ing. Alessio Cappelli, expert in Amiga
and NetBSD environments. People like Massimo Marino, writer for the biggest
selling videogames magazine in Italy, The Games Machine, and Nick Mordock,
experienced Amiga writer since years. Not to mention Andrea Favini, the 3000+
staff and Laura Falzone, writers of proved experience.

The CD part of Amiga.news differs from what we are used to see on the market. it
will not be a simple shareware collection. Of course it will contain the recent
shareware software from month to month, with index and search function, but it
will be thematic. The first issue of Amiga.it, published only in Italian, had
Linux as theme of the month, with a RedHatPPC distribution and a serie of
articles dedicated to installation of Linux, but not only. Every month a
different theme will fill the CD. I can anticipate that on the issue that will
be presented at Cologne, there will be a much requested Linux68k/RedHat68
distribution, and a special on Star Wars on Amiga.

I am available for every question, I will be happy to give all the answers you
may need, if you are a user or an Amiga distributor/reseller. You can find me at
the mailbox yurex@tin.it.

Director of Softwave

@node not05 "INFORMATION ABOUT THE DELIVERY STATUS OF THE G4 PRODUCT GENERATION"
       INFORMATION ABOUT THE DELIVERY STATUS OF THE G4 PRODUCT GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oberursel, 26.10.1999: Because of an unclear delivery situation of the Motorola
MPC107 system controller, which has been designed onto the Cyberstorm and
Blizzard G4 processor boards as the memory and PCI controller, the shipment of
these new G4 boards could not start by mid of October as earlier scheduled. As
there is no final statement about the availability by the vendor, we currently
investigate the possibility of using an alternative controller chip. If the use
of this alternative controller chip would be possible, the Cyberstorm and
Blizzard G4 processor boards would be shipped equipped even with an AGP port,
thus allowing to use a wider variety of the lastest and fastest graphis cards.

The evaluation of the technical features and the delivery lead times of this
alternative system controller, as well as the definitive availability schedules
of the MPC107 controller, will take approximately two more weeks until November
10, 1999. if the MPC107 can not be shipped by Motorola in quantities before end
of November, a shipment of the Cyberstorm and Blizzard G4 processor boards in
1999 will become very unlikely. If the MPC107 does not ship in time, and we
decide to use the alternative system controller, which is also a part of IBMs
Linux-PPC reference design, it must be expected that the Cyberstorm and Blizzard
G4 processor boards will start to ship early 2000.

As the add-ons modules are concerned, at this time the availability of the U2W
SCSI as well as the Fast SCSI II module can be confirmed. The current number of
back orders for the Ultra DMA ATA and the IEEE1394 module are yet not sufficient
to confirm the serial production.

All customer, who have ordered a Cyberstorm or Blizzard G4 processor board, will
receive a letter with a technical update and the new delivery schedules around
mid of November. Included with this letter we will also make an attractive offer
for the memory SO-DIMMs which are used on the Cyberstorm and Blizzard G4

                           PAYBACK STATUS REPORT: PART III
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "James Daniels" <james.daniels@apex-designs.net>

30 October 1999

This week(ish), I have been mostly...

   *...putting my A1200 into a tower. I quickly rediscovered that I'm
     definitely not a hardware person. Taking my beloved computer apart was
     pretty stressful, especially considering that it's my only development
     system. Thankfully, it all worked when I put it back together (well, apart
     from the audio mixer, but that should be sorted soon). Transplanting it
     into a tower has allowed me to fit a spanking new CD-RW drive as well,
     which will come in pretty handy when I need to write the gold CD for the
     game.

   *...converting the audio mixing code to assembler. This is taking a bit
     longer than I anticipated, but the results (so far) seem to be worth it.
     The assembler version of the mixer appears to only use up about 15% of the
     CPU's time, which means that the effect on the speed of the gameplay will
     be minimal.

   *...compiling the soundtrack. Several more bands have agreed to appear on
     the soundtrack. So far, nine artists have given permission, and have
     contributed a total of 14 pounding tunes. More details next update (and I
     really mean it this time :).

   *...getting a new domain name. Of course, you already know about this, but
     some people are still using the old URL. Please update your bookmarks!

Well, that's all for the time being. See you next time!

@node not07 "CMANAGER 1.7 IS NOW AVAILABLE"
                         CMANAGER 1.7 IS NOW AVAILABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Simone Tellini" <wiz@pragmanet.it>

The Contact Manager is a system address book which allows you to store all your
favourite user information, web sites, ftp sites and IRC server/channels. It is
designed as a replacement to the never-ending number of bookmarks, address books
and similar GUI's that are built into the many different Amiga Internet and
communication programs.

It offers a number of features over a lot of the internal bookmark/addressbooks:

   * You can store a range of different information for one user. In the user
     section, for instance, you can include their address, email address, phone
     number, fax number, web site, ftp site and so on. All these options can be
     utilised by other software. Voyager can use the web information,
     Microdot-II can use the email address, STFax Pro can use the fax number
     and so on.

   * One GUI, many programs. You can store all the information you require
     within one interface. No need to worry about Microdot-II's addressbook,
     Voyager's bookmarks, STFax Pro's phonebook, AmFTP's server list etc.

   * Interacts with other software. Microdot-II, AmIRC, Voyager, AmFTP, STFax
     Pro, DOpus Magellan and IBrowse (all available separately) will all add
     information to the Contact Manager from within these programs. For
     example, find an email address when reading a mail within Microdot-II?
     Just click 'add to addressbook' and the email address will be added to the
     Contact Manager.

     Some of these programs will use the Contact Manager in additional ways. For
     instance Microdot will call the Contact Manager when you press to: or cc:
     when writing a new message.

     Textinput (the built in Vapor text editor that ships with Microdot-II,
     Voyager, AmIRC, STFax Pro amongst others) now supports the ability to
     insert Contact Manager information into any document. For instance, say
     you were writing a message with Microdot-II, you could insert a name,
     email address, phone number or any other Contact Manager field, directly
     into that document. You will never have to remember a friends email
     address ever again!

   * Groups and sub-groups. The Contact Manager allows you to create groups for
     different kinds of users/addresses. AmFTP, for instance, does not allow
     you to create groups or sub-groups within its server list, however this
     can be achieved via the Contact Manager.

   * Multi-user support. If you are using Genesis as your TCP/IP stack, the
     Contact Manager will support and allow multiple users within one
     interface. If there are more than one user in your house (family members),
     each user can have their own configurations (with password) so that their
     information remains private.

   * Plugin links. AmIRC (from v2.1) now ships with an internal Contact Manager
     plugin. This allows you to add users to the Contact Manager from within
     AmIRC (based on the current userlist), add interesting channels to your
     Contact Manager channel list and even search for entries within Contact
     Manager from within AmIRC.

For further information, please read the accompanying documentation. Contact
Manager is available from Vaporware, http://www.vapor.com.

Changes in this version (1.7 18/10/99)

   * Fixed second argument of the hook MUIA_CManager_AppDoubleClick: A2 will
     point to the calling CM.mcc object.
   * The.mcc didn't reload the prefs when clicking on "Save".
   * Now it uses SpeedBar.mcc.
   * Fixed a ~16Kb memory leak in the MCC.
   * Fixed "Project->Open..." which failed under some circumstances.
   * Fixed ADT setting not being restored properly in the FTP edit window.
   * Fixed Search.
   * Fixed some Enforcer hits due to malloc() not being initialisated properly.

@node not08 "MIAMI 3.2B SECOND EDITION AVAILABLE"
                      MIAMI 3.2B SECOND EDITION AVAILABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Holger Kruse kruse@nordicglobal.com

Miami 3.2b second edition has been released.

This is not an update in the usual sense, but rather a set of extensions for the
existing Miami 3.2b release. New features include:

   * A ClassAct/ReAction GUI module. It is primarily intended for use with the
     ClassAct release in OS 3.5. It will work with some earlier ClassAct
     versions as well, but with some limitations, so such use is not
     recommended.

   * OS 3.5-compatible icons. These icons are identical in imagery to the icons
     in NewIcons format, but will work correctly when used as AppIcons under OS
     3.5.

You do NOT need to download the new archives if you are not interested in any of
these new features. No other parts of the Miami 3.2b release have been changed.

Localizations for many additional languages will be ready very soon. A separate
announcement will be made for that.

                    THE WORLD FOUNDRY: NOVEMBER UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Ed Collins <collins-e@dnet.co.uk>

1. TWF Opinion Polls

Two more polls have been completed since the last update.

The first of these polls, "What would your opinion be of a Linux version of
Explorer2260 ?" What a response that poll caused! There was a total of 258 votes
with the votes divided up as:

   * 192 or 74.4% - Good idea
   * 43 or 16.7% - AAGGH! Noo!!!
   * 23 or 8.9% - Bad idea

The second of the polls this month asked the question: "What's your favourite
control device ?" A total of 91 votes divided as such:

   * 45 or 49.4% - Mouse
   * 19 or 20.9% - Joystick
   * 15 or 16.5% - Neural Interface
   * 12 or 13.2% - Keyboard

A few complaints a mixed keyboard/mouse choice wasn't on the list. Oh well.
Can't please everyone.

The current opinion poll asks the question: "What is your favourite type of game
?" Fill in the form and let us know what games you like.

2. Explorer 2260 Update.

Here are a few of the things that have been done for Explorer 2260 in October:

   * More work on texture support and organisation (the editor now supports 5
     formats from 15 up to 32 bit)
   * Lots of networking research and testing. (Oh, the headaches!!)
   * Started converting sound library to PPC (now that AHI has gone PPC it's
     finally worth it).

To Do in November:

   * Improved texture handling for the object and entity editor
   * Add facilities to the display library to handle pre-rendered animations as
     well as realtime generated 3D ones.
   * Start work on the Linux server core.

The other news concerning E2260 is that we have decided to drop support for AGA
and make it a GFX card only game. This simplifies some of the development of the
3D game engine and from our recent poll has shown large support for this. This
will probably sadden and annoy AGA users which we are sorry about but the
decision is final.

3. Maim & Mangle Update.

Would you believe it! We haven't any news for M&M this month! Well very little
compared with other months.

Massi has had too many work commitments with his fulltime employment so could
find little time to work on M&M in October. He is now back working on M&M but
hasn't been able to settle on what is going to be done in M&M for November
(apart from dividing some of the GUI/sound programming work onto others). More
3D models have been done on the GFX front.

4. Next News Update

30th November / 1st December

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "David Gerber" <zapek@vapor.com>

The public prerelease version of V³ is available. Please check
http://v3.vapor.com/ for more informations.

This version is mainly a bug-fix release with many many bugs squashed and
improved stability. It is advised to reboot after the installation to be sure
that no old libraries are staying in the memory.

The VFlash plugin is currently NOT included in this archive, as the update is
still in internal testing. VFlash 0.16, as included in the pre4 archive, will
still work. An individual VFlash update will be released later on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As no surprise, Haage&Partner has announced they have taken Merapi, a project to
bring Java to the Amiga, away from their active distribution.

It seems that the co-operation with SUN has been very difficult and does not
proceed. To finalize the Java project "Merapi" in depth information and licenses
from SUN were needed. Despite intensive efforts of the developer team those
things could not have been provided.

Recently the authors assured that they still want to finalize this project for
the Amiga. As soon as Haage&Partner get news on this they will again officially
announce this project.

         OPUS MAGELLAN 5.82 WITH OS 3.5 SUPPORT TO BE SHOWN AT COLOGNE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

GPSoftware is proud to demonstrate its continuing support for the Amiga with the
release of a new version of Directory Opus Magellan which supports the new
palette mapped icon system of OS 3.5.

The product will be demonstrated on the Schatztruhe stand at the Cologne show,
November 12-14th November 1999 by Dr Greg Perry.

Opus Magellan is available world-wide from good Amiga dealers and GPSoftware
distributors. Or you may support the developers by purchasing direct.

Free Update Patch available.

OS 3.5 causes some superficial problems with earlier versions of Opus because of
the new palette mapped icon system which is not transparently compatibility with
earlier programs. With the help of Olaf Barthel, we have now added support for
the new V44 icon library in OS 3.5.

A free update patch from Opus 5.81 is available from our web site at

http://www.gpsoft.com.au

SuperView Productivity Suite II

SuperView IV (SViewIV) reads, writes and/or converts more than 50 graphic file
formats and seamlessy integrates external program packages like Xpk, Ghostscript
or MetaView. Thus besides displaying of graphics on over 20 supported graphic
cards (via CyberGraphX, Picasso96 or special driver systems) the program is
designed for working with almost any kind of image file format, including basic
image processing capabilities (more than 30 operators).

An unbeatable price/performance ratio for the SView Productivity Suite II
results out of the already included PPC-Modules for SViewIV delivering enormous
speed increases, as well as through the also included 680x0 and PPC-optimized
AmigaOS 3 Datatypes for JPEG (JFIF), PNG and TIFF, that additionally allow other
applications to profit from the unexpected new speed dimensions. Additionally
there's a MPEG-Player (PPC support, akMPEG) plus the NAIL datatype.

Overview of Features:

   * runable starting with 68000, many modules especially optimized for 68020
     and higher as well as PPC CPUs (for PowerUP(TM) and PPC-Library or WarpOS
     4 and PPC-Library emulation V0.6b+)
   * taking advantage of the special features of OS 2.04, 2.1, 3.0 and 3.1
   * image display either on own screen (ECS, AGA, graphics card) or in own
     window (AGA, cgfx-compatible graphics card)
   * fast, high quality dithering algorithms for 256 color and HAM6/8 screens as
     well as for image conversion
   * fast and reliable support for 16/24 bit RTG truecolor screen displays

     RGB8, PCX, WPG, BMP, PICT, YUVN and many more.
   * supports over 20 graphic cards directly or via RTG
   * more than 30 image processing operators included, some of which especially
     for dithering and format conversion

             NO 'SERVICE PACK' FOR OS 3.5 WITH OEM VERSION OF MIAMI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Holger Kruse" <kruse@nordicglobal.com>

There will be no 'service pack' for OS 3.5 with an OEM version of Miami. As far
as the OS 3.5 distribution goes, the Miami demo is final, and I am no longer
involved in OS 3.5 development or support in any way. The organizations to
contact for anything related to OS 3.5 are H&P and Amiga Inc.

There is still the possibility that, if I have time for it, I will compile the
next version of Miami (3.3) in such a way that legitimate users of OS 3.5 will
not have a time limit when using the demo, as a courtesy.

However at this time it is not even certain that Miami 3.3 will be released in
the foreseeable future at all, because of my busy schedule, so there is not much
point in making such a promise. Because of that delay in finishing 3.3 I just
released "3.2b second edition" a few days ago, and later today or tomorrow I
will release localized versions for several more languages. I was originally
holding back these things because I expected 3.3 to be available much sooner,
but that has changed now. Don't expect 3.3 within the next 3 months or so. It
may very well take 6 months or longer.

In any case, even if Miami 3.3 is released any time soon and it does work with
OS 3.5 without a time limit, then this would still be completely unrelated to
the OS 3.5 distribution and any service packs, i.e. 3.3 would be available from
my web site, not as part of an OS 3.5 service pack.

                          TORNADO 3.0 IS NOW AVAILABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tornado3D ThreeOh is now available and shipping, along with the new 340 pages
long manual. You can have a look at the Tornado3D 3.0 feature list and to some
pictures on: www.Tornado3D.com/30.html

Other significant changes from earlier versions (Amiga specific)

   * Native Amiga (OCS,ECS,AGA) and color index graphics card support officially
     dropped, T3D3 should still be able to run on native amiga displays / color
     index boards with third party emulation libraries (this comes with NO
     WARRANTY AT ALL).
   * Direct Virge3D support dropped, Virge will be supported in future Cgx3Drave
     releases with the CgxRave driver and no changes to Tornado3D's executable.
   * Newicon.library has been dropped due to users request
   * The screen font is now fixed. Tornado3D ThreeOh uses helvetica.font in
     sizes 9 and 11 and needs them.
   * The new Gui requires that NO patches that change the window's frame
     appearance are installed. Just turn off Tornado3D from their application
     list.
   * The "Tools" gadget window is gone will be replaced by a floating context
     sensitive button window in the future.
   * The Copy Protection system has been rewritten using all the data lines
     found in the hardware keys and creating new serial number encryption
     schemes. PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL RUNNING PROGRAMS THAT INTERFERE WITH THE
     DONGLE OR USING MOUSE SWITCHERS OR OTHER PASS-TROUGH DEVICES. (But we
     promise YOU, the paying users, that this time it will take much more than
     the year and a half the pirates needed last time. No one will use for free
     what you paid real money for.)

What will be in the Free in 3.1 updated to be released before Christmas

   * TRIPLE BUFFERING

     To speed up editor redraw keeping a copy of non moving objects and layers,
     that are currently redrawn at each frame. This will lead to an order of
     magnitude faster interactive performance.

   * Prestored PatchArrays

     This will lead to a several orders of magnitude faster redraw and editing
     of Sculpted Surfaces, as the spline patches will be recomputed only when
     the geometry changes and not at every redraw like now.

   * GolemGui

     For a fully interactive Plug-In panel, and easy to use scriptable Guis

   * Internal virtual memory

     Cuts in half rendering memory requirements

   * Even faster PowerPC

     Full custom math library and no need for 680x0 assistance.

   * Advanced force fields

     Completly redesigned force field system based on GolemGui will be a free
     PlugIn module to be installed into PlugIn Tab

   * And more...

@node not22 "VIRTUAL BALL FIGHTERS RTG DEMO VERSION IS NOW AVAILABLE"
            VIRTUAL BALL FIGHTERS RTG DEMO VERSION IS NOW AVAILABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Virtual Ball Fighters is a new game in production by Italian developers, XTeam
Software Solution. They have just released a demo version of this game, which is
going to be published by Epic Marketing.

The game itself is in the Tetris mould, while not being exactly the same type of
game it borrows a lot from this classic. You get balls falling from the top of
the screen in packs of 3, all of different colours, you aim is to align 3 or
more of these balls of the same colour either in a horizontal, vertical or
diagonal line. Obviously, as in Tetris the basic skill of the game is to rotate
this marbles so they are placed to your benefit.

However, this isn't just it though, as there is one thing that makes it a whole
new ball game, the fact that its all against another player. The whole aim being
to defeat them, as with other games of this type, you have to try and make sure
there screen is filled with marbles before yours is. There are bonuses that can
help you on your way too including increase opponents marble speed, energy
recovery, decrease you own marble speed and much more.

The player has a choice of charactors in the game all of which have their plus
and minus points, although in the demo you can only play as Alice. There are a
number of different play modes for the player to select from. They can either
play against the computer (the only mode available in the demo) or against
another player, there will also be tournaments for the single player to
participate in.

                         PAYBACK STATUS REPORT: PART IV
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "James Daniels" <james.daniels@apex-designs.net>

15 November 1999

The Bad News

Unfortunately, Payback is not going to be out by Christmas. It'll probably be
more like late February. This is partly because of delays getting the soundtrack
sorted (still no track listing yet - sorry!) and partly because I want to make
sure that Payback is as good as it can be. Sorry folks.

The Good News

The extra time means that I'll be able to make sure that Payback is really
top-notch. You can expect lots of hidden extras and great attention to detail.
I've also added four new screenshots to the screenshots area at
www.apex-designs.net/payback_screens.html to cheer you up.

Despite the delays, Payback is still progressing nicely. The audio mixing code
is now in assembler and doesn't noticeably effect the framerate of the game. One
of the more sophisticated features of the sound engine is that it can juggle up
to 100 sounds into the 12 available channels by automatically playing the
loudest. This allows me to add sound effects for almost every object in the game
- you can hear fires burning, phones ringing and people walking around, all in
glorious stereo.

Also, I've started adding the commands to the scripting language to allow
non-linear mission structures - all I've got to do now is actually make all the
levels!

Well, that's all this time. See you next update!

@node not28 "FUBAR DEVELOPMENT NEWS"
                             FUBAR DEVELOPMENT NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "bartman" <bartman@rosande.nu>

A long, long delay in e-mail once again, but be assured it's only for the good.
People want to know precisely what's been going on in regards to FUBAR's
development, so here it is.

Recently, I have been putting every effort into development, working 12 hours a
day on average, and this will continue until it's completely finished (what a
life).

But just where is development? What about this beta I promised two weeks ago?
Well, oops is all I can say to that. I'm very sure now that you lot all will
take what I say with a pinch of salt when it comes to dates, since I evidently
make a huge cock-up. Before I answer the beta question, here's what's been going
on precisely.

Since the demise of FUDGE (good idea, just not practical) the engine had to go
through several large changes to get it back to speed, after removing the FUDGE
code. Although, all the changes were for the good: improved refresh times,
improved sound support and quicker responses to the user. The video sub-system
runs just 5 frames slower when used with AGA compared to a graphics card - but
of course, it's much smoother on a graphics card. The sound sub-system is
complete panoramic 16-bit stereo (providing the user has the hardware which erm,
I don't) and supports streamed music files (i.e. sampled CDDA played from hard
disk). And who can forget the network sub-system, the input sub-system and
others.

Of course, when FUDGE was killed off, there wasn't much in the way of something
to play - it's all very well having a fancy driving system, but if there's
nothing to drive there's no point. Well, the finger was removed from the
metaphorical arse and lo and behold a quot;gamequot; directory appeared in the
FUBAR_Src dir on my hard disk.

Since FUBAR is a single-player and multiplayer game it has to be made like a
multiplayer game, and quot;hackquot; single-player support into it. How do you
make a multiplayer game? Well, since this is e-mail, you'll be aware of what a
quot;serverquot; is and what a quot;clientquot; is. FUBAR has to be both of
those things at the same time.

The quot;FUBAR serverquot; is responsible for actually running the game and
simulation. It must be around otherwise there can't be a game. The quot;FUBAR
clientquot; allows the player/user (or quot;clientquot;) to control what he/she
wants to do and communicate their objectives to the server. That's the basics,
and that's what it does.

The server handles all the simulation and orgastration which is required to make
the game work. This simulation includes building troops consisting of units,
creating cities in the world and building buildings inside cities to make them
of any use. The simulation also handles stuff the player can't necessarily
control - nature... weather effects and time, spring to mind.

The client translates all the server information into something the player will
(hopefully) understand on their screen. Things like, drawing the World Map,
displaying cities, giving the player feedback on goings on, etc.. That's the
specifics.

And, the specifics also mean reality. Yes, that's right. Re-al-it-y. This is
pretty much exactly what the game (yes, the GAME) does at this present moment in
time. So, to recap:

   * Full server support, via local connection (i.e. single player) or remote
     connection (via Internet/LAN/TCP stack).
   * Complete world support, featuring seasoned weather effects.
   * City creation and building. Relevant building simulation also supported,
     including unit training, resource mining, and other stuff.
   * Troop creation and deployment.

And also...

   * Full user-controlled front end, with logos, buttons and interactive system
     configuration (should the user want to change the pretty accurate default
     settings, tuned to their system).
   * Streamed music, played from hard disk (in 16-bit, hardware permitting) or
     played from CD tracks (heh, supported and works, but erm, I can't burn the
     real CD tracks since I don't have a CD-R :)
   * Complete World Map editor, with square assignment, and mission settings.

Plus a whole bunch of crap, which wouldn't interest the most computer-literate
people in the world.

So there you have it. Now, to answer that question - where's the beta? Here's my
plan for this:

Since Amiga Active are wondering what's going on, I think I'll get a demo ready
first, before I release a beta. There are plenty of little tweeks and suprises I
have to add before I can really call it a game, and I'd like to reserve those
for the beta, as the game as it stands is pretty cool enough for a simple demo.
Probably release a more complex demo when the beta has been released and tested.
That's my plan.

There's still one or two glitches in the simulation at the moment which can
detract from playability, which is why I am neglecting to release the demo now.
However, by Sunday (Monday at the latest) this will all be fixed, and the demo
shall be ready for release. Never thought I'd hear myself type that (grin :).

quot;This is all well and good, but what about the battle screen?quot; This is a
good question. I am pretty angry about the lack of input from most sources, and
I have realised in the past weeks that I am writing this whole game myself. Bare
in mind that I am doing the work of six people, and I'm loving every minute of
it (hey look, a pink elephant).

So the fate of the battle screen rests in the hands of artists. See, the problem
is that the battle screen is 99% visual. It's indiviual units moving around the
screen, animated in real-time on a tiled animated background. Note the key words
there: quot;movingquot;, quot;animatedquot;, quot;real-timequot;. All require
someone who can draw. Don't look at me, for Hell's sake.

If this lack of graphics (that means rendered animations for all the units -
designs that I do have (yes Ross, I found them! :)) isn't resolved quickly it
looks like goodbye to the battle screen. Which is a huge shame since there is so
many things we can do with it, from a multiplayer point of view - Capture The
Flag, Skirmish, Troop Deployment (heh, that's cool)... but, all of it requires
some cool graphics, which I most certianly aren't capable of doing. Shame.

Thankfully to address the lack-of-graphics problem for the World Map, I've got
the knack of drawing realistic-looking maps in Paint Shop Pro - sure, I draw in
24-bit, but drawing in 256 colours is an art in itself...

Graphics problems have dogged the project since day one. And it's come too far
now to stop, so solutions are required, if there are any. I'd be happy to leave
the game as a simulation, but the real-time element is unique - it's something I
don't want to hold off until we do the PC version... providing we can find the
manpower.

But anyway, I digress. With a quot;code preview demoquot; due at the weekend,
that's something to look forward to, eh?

@node not29 "PICASSO96 2.0 (BETA) NOW AVAILABLE"
                       PICASSO96 2.0 (BETA) NOW AVAILABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New version 2.0 of RTG system Picasso96 is now available. Picasso96 offers
support for many different Amiga graphics boards, has builtin HiColor and
TrueColor support for intuition screens and many more...

Requirements:

   * Kickstart and Workbench 3.0 (V39) or later,
   * Motorola MC68020 processor or better,
   * Altais, CyberVision64, CyberVision64/3D, Domino, Merlin, oMniBus,
     PicassoII, PicassoII+, PicassoIV, Piccolo, Piccolo SD64, Pixel64, Retina
     BLT Z3, Spectrum or uaegfx (for UAE, the UNIX/unusable/usable Amiga
     Emulator).

Changes in 2.0:

   * version bump due to large improvements.
   * first Draco Altais support.
   * rtg.library:
      * all Amiga graphics functions using the blitter now have working fallback
        routines using the CPU instead if necessary.
      * *NEW FEATURE*: added functionality to patch the most common native Amiga
        chipset screen modes to use a Picasso96 board to ease use and
        installation of Picasso96 on systems that don't have a native Amiga
        chipset (like the Macrosystem Draco) or that have no monitor attached
        to the native chip set signal connector or that don't have a flicker
        fixer and no 15 kHz capable monitor. To enable this feature add the
        tool type "FakeNativeModes=Yes" to the monitor driver of one of your
        cards (defaults to "Yes" with the Draco Altais and "No" for all other
        cards) and remove all native Amiga monitor drivers (!). Now, when the
        system uses one of the native Amiga screen modes (currently only
        LowRes, HighRes and SuperHighRes and their interlaced counter parts), a
        640x480 31kHz 60Hz screen mode on the graphics card will be used. Note:
        this mode is not configurable and it is not intended to be, because you
        should use real Picasso96 screen mode IDs whenever you can. Its only
        intention is to get the workbench on a VGA compatible screen when the
        current screenmode.prefs contains an invalid mode id. May also be
        useful for some (stupid) programs that default to a custom screen with
        a native Amiga screen mode after installation.
      * added checks and patches to support Draco (thanks go to Jürgen Döffinger
        for doing a big part of the work).
      * fixed BltBitMap rendering bug when blitting from 24 bit RGB to 32 bit
        BGRA (and also BGR to RGBA) (discovered by Niels Knoop).
      * fixed wrong line drawing on clipped planar Amiga bitmaps (thanks to
        Thomas Richter for finding and describing the bug).
      * found a wrong CyberFMT assignment that could cause HiColor bitmaps to
        get the wrong color format when used with programs using the
        cybergraphics.library API.
      * fixed slightly wrong MonitorSpec->ratio* values.
      * rearranged main library files and linking to ease replacing object files
        with own routines for programmers participating in the Picasso96
        rtg.library development.
      * added support for non-disk based board drivers (for drivers that will be
        launched automatically by UAE).
      * board drivers can now suppress the loading of settings and the creation
        of the edit screen mode used by Picasso96Mode. This is useful for
        drivers that generate their own display ids like UAEgfx.
      * fixed a possible race condition problem with the rtg.library memory pool
        management functions.
      * *NEW FEATURE*: software sprite routines will use on-board blitter when
        available. Therefore boards which have a blitter reserve about 12 KB of
        their memory for sprite and back buffers. This might affect the size of
        the largest screen that can be opened in some systems (mostly with 1MB
        cards).
      * fixed rendering problem with softsprites on Hi/TrueColor screens where
        transparent part was visible.
      * *NEW FEATURE*: alerts (Alert(), DisplayAlert(), TimedDisplayAlert()) now
        are rendered into the front most screen if it is a Picasso96 one. After
        termination of the alert, the display is restored.
      * *NEW FEATURE*: board drivers can now prevent the loading and attaching
        of settings files. Useful for the UAEgfx driver that creates its own
        modes and cannot use standard settings definitions at all.
      * *NEW FEATURE*: new environment variable "DisableAmigaBlitter" which even
        forces blits on standard planar Amiga bitmaps to be performed by the
        CPU. Set to 'yes' to enable this feature. If you don't use native Amiga
        screens, this could improve some operations on fast processors. On the
        other hand, Amiga screens will be slower. Defaults to 'No'.
      * *NEW FEATURE*: new environment variable "PlanesToFast" which when set to
        'Yes' will allocate planar bitplanes to fast memory except when the
        caller requested a visible or standard bitmap. Defaults to 'No'.
      * Flood() patch added (our thanks go to Olaf Barthel for the code).
      * BitMapScale() now scales between all combinations of RGB formats but
        needs to allocate some temporary memory, if this fails, nothing will be
        scaled... we should do a simple, braindead and slow fallback routine
        that needs no buffer for that case.
      * some internal optimisations, removal of unused code etc.
      * implemented CPU version of AreaEnd() which is important for the Draco,
        but with 68040 and 68060 systems this one is also faster than the
        original using the blitter (at least with ECS).
      * fixed bug in AreaEnd() which caused crashes (e.g. IconEdit filled
        ellipses that extended into negative rastport coordinates).
      * fixed BltMaskBitMapRastPort() bug with standard planar Amiga bitmaps.
      * fixed bogus softsprite savebuffer restoration in upper left corner.
      * fixed bugs that caused CVision 3D to clear a small odd rectangle
        sometimes.
      * added functionality to our custom semaphore routines and found a bad
        bug, too. Rechecked all possible scenarios.
      * fixed BltPattern bug which sometimes caused wierd results when the
        DisableAmigaBlitter environment variable was set.
      * fixed a small problem with LoadView that led to incomplete wakeup after
        a program had temporarily changed the display with LoadView(0). Thanks
        to Pavel Narozny and Thomas Richter for pointing that out.
      * possible enforcer hit in AllocBitMap() fixed by Thomas Richter.
      * Draw() bug with line pattern on obscured clip rects and another possible
        race condition issue in Draw() fixed by Thomas Richter.
      * fixed a rare but serious bug triggered by Picasso96Mode, causing it to
        crash.
   * PicassoIV, PicassoII, Piccolo, Piccolo SD64, Pixel64, Spectrum (all Cirrus
     based boards):
      * fixed mouse sprite rendering problem at top of the screen when BIGSPRITE
        was selected (also Thomas Richter).
      * fixed yet another sprite rendering problem that could cause illegal
        memory accesses with autoscroll screens (again Thomas Richter).
   * PicassoIV:
      * more and finer pixel clocks for better mode adjustment.
   * CVision3D:
      * fixed ZorroII YUV422 PIP problem using the wrong memory aperture (Pavel
        Narozny)
      * extended memory clock range from 45 to 77 MHz - still defaults to 55 MHz
      * implemented hardware acceleration for 2D line drawing
   * RetinaBLT Z3 and Draco Altais (NCR chip driver changes by Jürgen
     Döffinger):
      * small changes with masked blits (less overhead).
      * implemented hardware support for BltPattern.
      * hardware sprite uses color 3 as inverted color now (unlike all other
        cards).
   * added Draco checks to monitor driver.
   * InstallScript and Installation:
      * Added the Draco Altais.
      * Added PVS, the Picasso96 Variable Setter by Ralph Torchia (requires
        MUI).
      * Creates ENV:Picasso96 and ENVARC:Picasso96 during installation and
        updates. Also creates all supported variables and sets them to the
        default values. Deletes everything during uninstall, too.
      * if the install script is activated and the system language is not
        properly selected (no or invalid ENV:Language) or there is no
        translation of the install script for that language, you now will be
        asked to choose a language first.
      * therefore only one 'Install' icon necessary.
      * added icon for the Picasso96.readme file so that the users can read
        about the recent changes more easily.
      * renamed the Installer script icon to 'Setup' to better reflect that the
        script handles installation, updates and deinstallation
      * added nederlands and norsk translations (Pieter Roodnat and Uwe Kubosch)
   * Picasso96API:
      * fixed bug in 1.43 that caused the width and height parameters of PIPs to
        be ignored when opening the PIP.
      * *NEW FEATURE* user can now allocate private bitmaps that do not need to
        be locked. Especially useful for programs that need temporary fast
        memory bitmaps for rendering.
      * p96WritePixel(): fixed softsprite image trashing bug.
      * moved some functionality to the rtg.library.
   * cybergraphics.library emulation:
      * WriteRGBPixel(): fixed softsprite image trashing bug.
      * fixed some CGX API function return values to be more compatible with the
        public documentation.
      * DoCDrawMethodTagList(): fixed bug with obscured cliprects.
      * moved some functionality to the rtg.library.

                              HERETIC2 SPEED TEST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Steffan Haüsser"

Amiga:

   * Cyberstorm PPC 604e 150 MHz (yes, only 150, i have a lowend 604e Board...)
   * Cybervision/PPC
   * OS: AmigaOS 3.0 (3.5 is ordered, but not yet arrived) + WarpOS V4

PC:

   * Pentium II 300 MHz
   * Riva TNT (TNT 1) Based AGP-Bus Graphics Board
   * OS: Windows 95

Remember: All speed is done with SOFTWARE RENDERER, for both systems, for
fairness :)

The values (i tested at different places, but of course PC and Amiga version
were always tested at the same place):

Level Amiga
(150 MHz) PC
(300 MHz)
dmandoria 31 fps 60 fps
oglemine1 35 fps 72 fps
oglemine1 different location with
lots of monsters visible 24 fps 45 fps
hive1 (lot of transparency FX)
no typical situation for the game 9 fps 27 fps
Startlevel in 400x300 24 fps 41 fps
Startlevel in 640x480 10 fps 19 fps


What do we learn of this ?

  1. On an average the Amiga Version has the same speed like the PC version (at
     least if we had a PC with the same MHz-number, 31*2 = 62 fps for example,
     where the PC version had 60 fps, the Amiga Version 31 fps (first example)
  2. Massive Transparency Effects are the death for every software-renderer, no
     matter if Amiga or PC. Luckily these effects are not displayed all the
     time. Situations like at the start of hive1 only happen in very few
     situations (hive1 is actually the slowest level in the whole game, it
     seems, at least at a certain position in the level)
  3. The speed value of Heretic II is actually quite nice, even on a lowend PPC
     like mine, on a 233 MHz you will have values around 233/150 times as fast.
  4. We can expect much more from 3D Hardware (Warp3D Support) (On PC there was
     a REALLY HUGE speedup for 3D Hardware, especially when Transparency was
     involved)
  5. PCI/AGP did not give that much more speed than PowerUP-Bus/Zorro 3 (i did
     not do actual speedtests of Z3, but it is not that much slower than on
     Zorro 3. Also WB Window Mode is also not that much slower - though of
     course slower)

I was also told by Hyperion that they are currently making much progress for the
68k version, and that it looks good that probably 060+software renderer will be
fast enough to get the game playable.

               LIGHT FORCE: A TRON CLONE IN DEVELOPMENT FOR AMIGA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Andreas Hippauf

Hi,

We formed a programming-team with the label "strange worlds" (the title reflects
our wish to create whole, virtual worlds). Our first project "newtron" became
more professional with the two new members on board: Costel Mincea will act as
artist and is responsible for the intro and all other animation-sequences.
Oliver Schuler should be well known, as he did already the glTron-Amiga-Port and
will help out with some 3D-calculations of normal-vectors (needed for light und
texturing).

Please note that the project newtron now has a new title: the finished game will
be called LIGHT FORCE and will be available on CD. Since the remaining of the
game title the old newtron-pages don't exist any longer. The game LIGHT FORCE
itself is completly integrated in our LA-Workbench on internet, so detailled
information about LIGHT FORCE are available on
home.t-online.de/home/AHippauf/home.htm.

The new demo-version of our graphics engine is available there, too! The new
demo now features 1 or 2-player mode, several views, collision-detection,
improved controls (mouse!), rather stupid enemies, score counting and so on!
Check it out!

Once again we must point out, that there was very poor response from users via
email! We hope to get more response with the new demoversion. Without at least
200 Amiga-Users showing interest in the game, it is not for sure, wether we
finish the game or not. The more people, that tell us, what they liked or what
they want to have in any other way, the more time we are goint to invest in the
final game!

                        PAGESTREAM 4 HAS BEEN RELEASED!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, the wait is over, and Pagestream 4 is here.

Pagestream 4 is the first major update of Pagestream in over three years. Its
developers, SoftLogik, have been saving our feature requests, looking at the
current industry "leaders" and thinking of ways to improve an already great
product. Obviously, the thing has been to try and deliver the features needed
and still keep the same ease of use that puts them ahead of the rest. Features
such as indexing, table of contents, complex page numbers and figure numbering
and figure tables make long documents a snap. Editable kerning pairs, tracking
tables and hiding punctuation makes Pagestream typographic capabilities even
more outstanding. Doing colour work? Then you will impress with the colour
trapping of objects and text. Trying to generate both print and on-line
materials? Let PDF and HTML export help you. Pagestream 4 has something new to
offer in every step creating anything from colour pages to technical drawing to
newsletters to books.

Feature List

   * Negative indexing
   * PDF export
   * Multilevel Chapter / page numbering / names (ie 6.8.1)
   * Highlight page number / date / time to edit.
   * Defined styletags and variables at chapter level.
   * Negative signature printing (many pages on one)
   * Business card / label printing
   * Configurable FPO size
   * HTML import and export
   * Definable default text attributes
   * Colour / style in use toggle
   * Layers
   * Drag and Drop text
   * Find and replace improvements:
      * Insert special characters
      * Wild Cards
      * Attributes
   * Trapping
   * Auotmatic before and after paragraph rules
   * True small caps
   * Table of contents generation
   * Figure Numbering
   * Table of figure Generation
   * Paragraph numbering
   * Definable kerning pairs
   * Definable tracking tables
   * Optical alignment / handling production
   * Edit mask in place
   * Page setup for spreads / range of pages
   * Book marks
   * Collect for output
   * Lasso select
   * and much more...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

AmTelnet II is a client for the Internet "Telnet" and "SSH" protocols for
remotely logging into computers, playing text-oriented multi-user games ("MUD"s
or "MUSH"s) or manually simulating internet protocols.

2. Note for registered AmTelnet 1.x users

AmTelnet II requires new keyfiles. However, the upgrade for registered AmTelnet
1.x users is *FREE*. New keyfiles have been mailed out to all existing AmTelnet
1.x users to the e-mail addresses on which they originally received their
keyfiles.

Should you, for some reason, not have received your AmTelnet II keyfile yet,
please mail your current AmTelnet keyfile together with a short note on *WHERE*
and *WHEN* you originally registered to <keyfile-update@vapor.com>. Please note
that those requests have to be manually processed by a poor overworked software
developer (me), and thus they generally have awkward response times -- sorry for
that.

Please note that NetConnect II users are not entitled for an free AmTelnet II
upgrade. AmTelnet II may be part of the general NetConnect III upgrade, however,
please contact Active Technologies for any relevant information on the
NetConnect package issues.

3. Bug reporting

Please mail bug reports and enhancement suggestions to

   * <amtelnet-bugs@vapor.com>

Any reportes submitted this way are automatically entered into the VaporWare bug
tracking system. Please see

   * http://bugs.vapor.com/

on more information on how to access the bug tracking system.

4. Documentation

As the time of writing, AmTelnet II totally lacks any documentation. Any
volunteers on that are greatly appreciated :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since last public release (AmTelnet 2.0)

2.0.1

   * General: fixed "Conntect thread" wrongly passing port number (Carlos)

2.0.2

   * General: SSH thread connections now works for all cases (Carlos)
   * General: if the host the threaded connection is about to be spawned to
     exists in the phonebook and has a short name (profile name) defined
     AmTelnet passes it, to allow auto-login to take place in new AmTelnet too
     (Carlos)
   * General: Added "Clone connection" menu item for doing multiple connection
     to the same host easier (Carlos)

2.0.3

   * General: removed a lot of stale code (Olli)
   * General: fixed an extremly lame bug in setting the iconify title with long
     hostnames. Buffer overflow and crash either during operation or more
     likely on quit. We had this before, didn't we? (Olli)

2.1 (release)

   * added updated Vapor libraries and MCCs

2.1.1

   * Net: now sends an explicit window size packet after logging, to make sure
     the remote terminal really catches it. (Olli)
   * GUI: fixed window title to represent proper terminal size in fullscreen
     mode (Olli)
   * Net: hopefully fixed a few problems with XPR transfers (Olli)

2.1.2

   * Net: fixed another problem with IAC escaping in the XPR driver which could
     return "0 bytes read" even when a byte was read, but this was collapsed
     due to IAC deescaping. Should fix Z-Modem problems (Olli)
   * GUI: made XPR window break button more responsive (Olli)

2.1.3

   * GUI: Fkeys could insert trash, depending on stack contents (Olli)
   * GUI: manually entering a hostname after having connected to a different
     host via the phonebook before should work now (Olli)

2.1.4

   * GUI: relabeled "Entry name" in phone book back to "Short name", for the
     sake of clarification (Olli)
   * Net: fixed XPR over SSH, broken in 2.1.3 (Olli)
   * GUI: clicking "Sort" in the phonebook would desync the internal "active
     entry" pointer and thus overwrite an phonebook entry (Olli)

2.1.5

   * GUI: chat bar status is now saved as well (Olli)
   * SSH: now returns "ansi" terminal type when in ansi mode (Olli)

2.2

   * Net: it's now possible to explicitely set the terminal reported during DO
     TTYPE / SSH terminal type negotiation (as some older termcaps don't have
     proper "ansi" entries)
   * added updated Installer script, libs and classes
   * recompiled with full optimization for release

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "James Daniels" <james.daniels@apex-designs.net>

                                1 December 1999

The News

Things have been a bit busy these last few weeks, so I've not made as much
progress as I would have liked. Anyway, here's what I have been up to:

   * I've given the site a fairly radical facelift - hope you like the new look.
     Let me know what you think!
   * I've been negotiating the soundtrack; so far, 11 bands have agreed to
     appear in the game, contributing a total of 16 songs. However, only a few
     have managed to send me the signed contracts yet, so it could a couple
     more weeks until things are finalised.
   * I've been squishing bugs in the code. As usual. :-)
   * I've been looking into Locale support.
   * I've started to add some more advanced scripting features to allow the
     script to put messages up on the player's screen. Now that the
     communications backbone between the script and the game engine is working
     properly things should progress a lot quicker.

Well, that's all for the time being. See you next update!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30-November-1999: Current status on Shogo Amiga/Mac port by Thomas Frieden

Client

The client took much less time than expected. After just two weeks, the client
completed its startup up to the point where it wanted to start up the client
shell, which is the part that actually contains the game itself. It seems the
client is fully operational, with just some minor quirks (for example, parts of
exploding MCA's seem to be made of rubber, they bounce a little too high).

My current occupation is to find the last remaining bugs, and to try to reduce
the memory consumption, which is now around 40 MB, depending on the level
played.

Client Shell

The client shell is the part of the program where the "real" game resides, it
contains the things like menus, user interface, and the code to initiate a game.
It was relatively easy to port to a state that allowed it to start and host a
local game. The network startup is handled by a Windows dialog, which is the
only code that is not yet ported.

Renderer

We ported the software renderer first - it was easier because of the relatively
Windows-free code. The first version was a prototype that did not do any 3d
rendering, just display handling, input and surface management. When that worked
(it was the work of one day), I ported the rest of the renderer. Despite some
very hard work to find bugs (one took me nearly a week), it worked nearly "out
of the box". The speed is acceptable, even the current version with all the
debugging code in it is as fast as an equivalent Pentium system.

The hardware renderer is currently worked on by Joe Serra, who is porting the
DirectX stuff over to our own OpenGL implementation, which is currently done by
Hans-Joerg Frieden.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Ed Collins <collins-e@dnet.co.uk>

#1. TWF Opinion Polls#

There has only been only poll held this month which asked the question: "What is
your favourite type of game ?".

This was split into 10 different game types with the top 2 choices being RPGs
and Space Sims with the votes of 37 and 33 respectively. Well no surprise you're
all wanting a good space sim. :)

A new poll will appear soon.

#2. Explorer 2260 Update.#

Here are a few of the things that have been done for Explorer 2260 in November:

   * RedHat 6 (LinuxPPC 3Q99) has been installed and, while lots of setup work
     still needs to be finished, work on the Linux server core routines is
     continuing.
   * More background documents for the CEG are being created.

@node not39 "NORDIC GLOBAL: CHANGES FOR THE YEAR 2000"
                    NORDIC GLOBAL: CHANGES FOR THE YEAR 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am happy to announce that starting January, 2000 I will work for REBOL
Technologies in the capacity of Director of Network Technologies.

For those of you who have not heard about that company before: REBOL
Technologies (www.rebol.com) is a privately held company that was founded by
Carl Sassenrath, one of the premier developers of AmigaOS. REBOL Technologies
develops and distributes the scripting language REBOL, a very intuitive
programming language and run-time environment with built-in Internet support and
messaging capabilities. REBOL is available for over 50 computer platforms,
AmigaOS being one of them. The basic version of REBOL is available for free,
extensions are available for license fees.

Declining revenues from Amiga software sales and increased software piracy in
1999 finally forced me to look for a full-time job outside of my own company.
Between several job offers I decided to accept the offer by REBOL for several
reasons. The most important one is that in my opinion REBOL is currently one of
the few truly innovative products in the software market, and with Carl
Sassenrath's history with AmigaOS his company and its product in many ways
reflect and represent the Amiga spirit.

With my background in AmigaOS and TCP/IP I am excited about the opportunity to
participate in the development of REBOL, in particular in the improvement of its
networking capabilities, the AmigaOS port and ports for possible Amiga
successors.

I am afraid this new job means that I will no longer be able to work full-time
on my own Amiga software (Miami, Daytona etc.). This does not mean that the
software becomes unsupported or that I am leaving the Amiga platform though. I
intend to still provide updates and support for existing software, as my time
permits. Here are some details about current plans for my Amiga software:

   * AmiWin: still supported. An update with 24-bit support and a newer X11R6
     kernel is still planned, but unlikely to be ready soon.
   * Daytona and related products: I am afraid Daytona and its planned
     extensions have to be cancelled. There are two reasons for this: one is
     lack of time: with my new full-time job I have to cut back somewhere, and
     doing it on a project that is still in development seems to be the most
     reasonable solution. The other reason is a possible conflict of interests,
     because Java and REBOL are competitors in the market of languages for
     distributed computing, which may make it unethical for me to remain
     involved in Java-related software. I have not yet determined what will
     happen to the Daytona sources. There are several options, somewhat
     restricted by Sun's licensing conditions, and I will try to find a
     solution that will somehow still allow the existing Java VM of Daytona to
     be released to the Amiga community, without future involvement or support
     from me though.
   * Miami: still fully supported. Version 3.3 is planned for release in the
     year 2000.
   * Miami Deluxe: fully supported. After several delays and many improvements
     the first full release including documentation will probably be ready
     before Christmas, and after that development will continue. Subject to
     demand the planned improvements for future versions may include IPv6,
     IPsec, named, extensions to IP-NAT and possibly dial-in support.
   * MiamiSSL: fully supported. A new version that incorporates the latest
     OpenSSL changes and protocols is planned.
   * MiamiTelnet: fully supported, as part of the Miami Deluxe package. Telnet
     encryption and support for running in a shell window are planned for
     future versions.
   * ppp.device: still supported, but no new versions are planned. Miami and
     Miami Deluxe should be considered successors of ppp.device.
   * ReOrg: not supported at this time. A version with support for NSD and disks
     > 4 GB is something I am considering though, time permitting.

I will also have to move my residence from Winter Park, Florida to Ukiah,
California, where REBOL headquarters are located. This means my LAN will have to
move as well, including the server that handles Miami registrations and orders.
Because of that there will be some service outages affecting my Internet
presence during the months of December '99 and possibly January 2000. Please see
my separate announcements about that. On the up side, chances are my LAN will
get a DSL connection in Ukiah, which should provide better reliability and much
faster responses, in particular for mailing lists, than the current 56k
connection.

Wishing everyone a happy holiday season and a successful year 2000.

                       OPEN LETTER TO THE AMIGA COMMUNITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Steve Crietzman" <president@savetheamiga.org.uk>
 
COSA Progress Update
 
November 17, 1999
 
Dear Fellow Amigans:
 
COSA feels it is time that we followed up on our open letters to Tom Schmidt
with a letter to the people that really matter: you, the members of the Amiga
community.
 
We have so much news to report, and so much progress has been made in recent
weeks, that we felt it was time that we the community on to date on our
progress.

I want to start by thanking everyone who has written us with good comments and
suggestions over the past several weeks. I also want to assure you all that we
have read each and every e-mail message sent to us very carefully, and
considered the issues you have raised in great detail.
 
It is clear to us that there is still a great deal of confusion amongst the
community as to what COSA is doing, and what we are trying to achieve. The
responsibility for this lies with me, for not properly communicating our plans
to the Amiga community. I would like to make amends for that now, by taking a
leaf out of Jim Collas's book, and providing you with regular updates on our
progress from this point forwards.

I would like to start by tackling the main issues of confusion: explaining who
COSA is, where we came from, and why we're here.

COSA, the Campaign to Open Source AmigaOS, had it's beginnings soon after the
Amiga executive updates of September 14th and 17th. We were formed to bring
together the Amiga community, and to discuss ways forward for the Amiga.
 
On October 4th, after several weeks of discussion and exchanging of ideas, we
came to the conclusion that what makes the Amiga special and unique, is the
operating system. The technology may be falling behind, but our operating system
still has something special and unique to offer the world, and that's what has
really kept us with the platform through the last several years.
 
With this in mind, our discussions then focused on ways to preserve and expand
the Amiga operating system. We discussed many possibilities. But we realised we
also needed to think long-term. Not just about the immediate future of the
operating system, but it's long-term survival and growth, in a highly
competitive, ever-changing computing industry.
 
We concluded that to survive in this market, Amiga OS needs to be overhauled and
upgraded. It needs to be brought up-to-date to take advantage of new hardware
and concepts in software engineering that have emerged over the past six years.

Amiga OS also needs to be made available to the masses. As much as we wish it
wasn't true, the traditional Amiga market is shrinking. The classic Amiga range
is no longer competitive or attractive to the masses, and therefore people will
not be rushing to their local computer stores to buy new Amigas.

For it's long-term survival and growth, Amiga OS also needs to be made available
to a wide variety of CPUs, or what Jim Collas referred to as "operating
environments."

Devoid of Gateway's official support for an aggressive expansion of the Amiga OS
in this way, we need to search for another large group of people with the
necessary commitment and ability to "make it happen."

We need to look no further than the high degree of talent that already exists in
the Amiga developer community. We have AROS. We have the Aminet freeware
developers. We have commercial developers. And we have over 100 registered
developers who have already pledged to work on an open-source Amiga OS if it
becomes available.

Collectively, the worldwide Amiga development community has the manpower and
experience necessary to bring the Amiga operating system into the 21st century,
and keep the Amiga vision alive.

The Amiga community needs to unite like never before. We can no longer rely on
anyone but ourselves, because there is no-one else left.

No Commodore. No Escom. No Gateway.

Just the Amiga community of users, developers and dealers - no parent company to
guide us.

With no parents, it becomes time we became responsible for ourselves - that we
collectively pull our resources together, and convince Gateway to let the
community have a go where others have failed.

COSA has been in contact with many key players in the Amiga community to
discuss the way forward. These include Amiga International, Amino, Haage and
Partner, AROS, Project IMP, PowerOS, and even Tom Schmidt at Amiga Inc. We are
partners in this process.

Collectively, we are working together to create a roadmap for the future
development of the Amiga operating system.
 
It is important people realise that we are not creating a new Amiga OS. We are
not replacing it, either. Our proposal is for the community to collectively
drive future upgrades of the current Amiga operating system. To take what we
already have, and build upon it.
 
By "community," we do not exclude anyone. Anyone with an Amiga or who
understands the Amiga is included. Haage and Partner, the current developers of
OS 3.5, are most certainly not excluded from taking part in this process.

Our vision includes Haage and Partner at the forefront of Amiga OS development,
supported by a worldwide team of open-source developers. We are hopeful of
reaching an agreement/compromise with H&P over a role for their company and
developers in the future development of an open-source AmigaOS. 

Together, we hope to present a united plan to Amiga Inc to bring the Amiga
operating system closer to the community. It is way past time that the community
takes charge of it's own destiny, and we believe open-sourcing the OS is the
easiest and most common-sense, long-term way to do this.

In the coming weeks, a Frequently Asked Questions section will be created on
COSA's website to address the most common questions, concerns, ideas, and
thoughts presented to us. We will also be publishing a green paper that details
a possible migration from the current closed-source system to an inclusive
open-source system, whereby everyone - Haage and Partner, AROS, PowerOS, Aminet
developers, everyone - is able to contribute and work on the Amiga OS project -
building on what we already have, and improving it.
 
The weeks and months ahead hold much promise. All we ask from you, the
community, is to give us time, and a little breathing room.
 
We do not yet have all the answers, but as time passes, more and more questions
are being asked, more answers to these questions found, and the mist that
obscures the path ahead is clearing.

We realise the community has been let down many times in the past, and we do not
expect to earn your trust or faith overnight. All we ask is that you give us a
chance, and that you give us time. We hope, however, that over the long-term,
COSA will be able to earn your trust and restore your faith in the Amiga
platform and it's future.

Because at the end of the day, it is the Amiga community that we serve. COSA is
here to help bring the community together, into discussion and dialogue, and
help us collectively find a way out of the fog that currently obscures the
future of everyone's favourite OS.

From recent events, it would seem that AROS, Project IMP, PowerOS, Haage and
Partner, Amiga International and COSA are all in total agreement that discussion
and co-operation, and not competition, is the way forward for our community.

COSA has succeeded in bringing these groups to talk to each other. Now COSA
hopes to play a role in finding an open-source solution that will satisfy these
groups and bring a bright future to the Amiga operating system, and we intend to
do just that.

If we stand together as a community, we can collectively ensure the success of
our favourite operating system, AmigaOS. If we are divided, we will all
collectively fail. 

We ask that the community gives the process that COSA has fostered a chance to
develop and grow, and allow these groups to co-operate with each other and find
a common settlement that will be of benefit to Amigans everywhere.

Your own contributions to this process would be much appreciated. Visit our
website for details on how you can help this process succeed.

COSA is here to help Amigans everywhere by giving Amiga OS a bright future.

Best regards,

Steve Crietzman
President, Campaign to Open Source AmigaOS
On behalf of our members and partners

               HOME ELECTRONICS WORLD '99 REPORT BY CAGHAN DEMIRCI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Home Electronics World '99 Report by Caghan Demirci
(Edited by James Russell, AO Editor-in-Chief at large)

1999-10-21 - (Amiga.org) - From the desk of Amiga.org's roving reporter, Caghan
Demirci, comes this recount of the recent Home Electronics World (HEW) show in
Cologne, Germany.

I rushed into the Home Electronics World 99 at noon on Saturday November 13th,
only to find my vision blocked by a barrage of irrelevant "home electronics"
stands, who would gladly sell you their PC hardware and software ranging from
the odd SCSI cable to the slick steering wheel at bargain prices. The Amiga
stands gathered together at the further end of the hall, with no clear
separation between the two partitions.

In the very middle of the floor towered the Amiga Inc. stand in all its
grandeur, looming over the crowd and the various Amiga dealers on its four
sides. The stand included a little bar where you could eat sausages, drink coke,
and, well, eat sausages and sit around chatting. A constant hubbub was afoot
right outside at the very center of Amiga Inc.'s facade. All kinds of novelty
items were up for grabs, with Amiga posters, pens, matchboxes, cups, cola,
stickers, and even Amiga socks and boxer shorts, (and stop with the boing balls
jokes!). Two of the walls led to offices and little depots, and through the
other two you could enter and leave. This whole cube was surrounded by showcases
and stood facing outwards, and further toward the rim there are many display
"nodes" suggesting a bigger rectangle. The stand was so dominant that even if
you thought you were walking in the same direction, you would soon end up back
at some unexpected node of the central stand.

The highlight of Amiga Inc.'s stand this year was the Amiga history exhibition
with showcases on three sides of the central cube. Displayed items ranged from
an ancient Commodore PC to the wedge box and desktop Amigas, "Best computer of
the year" awards, the CDTV, the CD32 and finally the Walker. If you browsed
carefully, you couldn't help but stumble upon the A500 PPC card by DCE that
never actually got released. "Is that even possible?" you ask. An adapter kludge
to bring the BlizzardPPC and the A500 motherboard together, and you have it. Try
running Wipeout on that!

One of the nodes was dedicated to ongoing IRC conferences at #hew99. Have you
ever wondered who the guy was that told you "Send me a '?' and I'll put you on
the question queue?" For the first time in my life, I've seen the administrator
for real. This guy has to sit in front of his computer all day typing his time
away, -- did you know he ate his breakfast, lunch and supper in front of the
monitor as well?

At a second Amiga Internet node anyone could try his hand out at the new Voyager
3.0.37, or AmTelnet, and more. Right beside this node was the AmigaOS 3.5
demonstration stand, receiving continuous attention from a host of people who
seriously considered leaving the fair with this wonder box under their arms,
also for sale at the Amiga Inc. stand. One couldn't help noticing that the
stand employee was constantly very busy displaying the secrets of the updated
OS and advocating its future prospects. The very curious onlookers selected
multiple icons and dragged them over the screen, exclaiming "Echt cool!" when
they beheld the neat dragging effect.

Another node was Amiga Zentrum Thuringen showing off TVPaint, and what drew
particular attention there was Amiga LinuxPPC running on various and sundry
Amiga screens. APUS is one of Amiga's really tight grips on survival, and the
fact that LinuxPPC was being exhibited on almost the same level with OS 3.5
shows how much significance Amiga Inc. grants to it. KDE ran superbly,
multitasking rather well with an X11amp for good company, and on one other
screen AfterStep was running its super-fast rounds around the PowerPC CPU.

When he wasn't rushing to his office or to the bathroom for a quick break, Amiga
vice president Petro Tyschtschenko could always be seen surrounded by Amigans
from around Europe. As this is my first Amiga fair, (gulp!) I gathered up the
courage and finally went up and met him. I must say Amiga's vice president is a
really, really nice man; the community is lucky to be headed by someone who
loves and cares about the Amiga as much as Petro does. No one else from Amiga
Inc. came along -- probably they believed rightly that they would be scorned and
absorbed in arguments without end. "I have to sell stuff and keep a business
running," says Petro. "Business as usual." Some say he wasn't as cheerful as in
the previous fairs; but as to how much of the shaken and insecure mood of his
listeners infected him, no one can know. Supposedly the Amiga section of the
show is smaller than in the previous years, and the aisles have been widened to
make strolling easier; even so, there were crowds at every stand, talking,
arguing, and shopping.

Haage&Partner

Haage&Partner, now of OS 3.5 fame, was the star of the show. They had a big, big
stand, in fact the whole block with its four sides. Jurgen Haage was bustling
about trying to make money and talking with curious chaps about the Amiga market
situation. One couldn't help noticing that on Saturday, the AmigaOS 3.5 boxes at
his stand were almost sold out!

Gone (at last!) from Amiga stands are the faint OS 3.1 screens in low resolution
that once embarrassed Amigans in front of PC-owning visitors. In practically
every stand, OS 3.5 was installed and in full color, high resolution. The
popular OS was selling in large quantities at the fair, true, but Haage&Partner
need to sell more. Jurgen Haage was rightly concerned about piracy. He explained
that Haage&Partner had spent so much development effort on OS 3.5, and
maintained such a cheap price tag for an operating system, that the availability
of pirate copies was destructive and hostile.

Jurgen Haage agreed that the untimely launch of the AmigaOS open source petition
had put a lot of impulse OS 3.5 buyers off the cause. After a few months of the
OS release, the campaign could have done no harm, but when it got launched right
before the release, many people could have convinced themselves that
Haage&Partner shouldn't have done in-house OS development in the first place!
Nonetheless, Jurgen Haage believes that AmigaOS can eventually go open source,
but not in the way petitioners suggest. When patent problems are out of the way,
open source development should be a strictly centralized and thoroughly guided
effort, much like Netscape's Mozilla project, where everyone who is given access
to the source must describe exactly what he has done with it and turn it in.
Petro, too, is not very interested in what the open source campaign can do. "My
first priority now is to convert the OS to the PowerPC," he says.

At any rate, Jurgen Haage is seriously determined to produce OS 3.6 (where Miami
might be replaced with Genesis because of financial problems).

One booth at the show sported a tower containing an IBM PowerPC motherboard.
Publication of the IBM PPC board specification to form a basis for the common
PPC platform (remember PReP?) obviously caused an excited stir among eminent
Amiga developers, since not only did it mean liberation from the CHRP swamp that
had suffocated the PPC, but it also implied that a PPC-based Amiga-compatible
motherboard could be produced with relative ease! That's right, an excellent
scheme that had been proposed several years ago but never realized -- an Amiga
motherboard running on the PowerPC chip -- is now at the very focus of Amiga
Inc.'s plans! Of course, the operating system will have to be converted to the
new CPU, a painful project that Haage&Partner is willing to undertake.

The other three sides of the stand were taken up by promotions for a lot of fine
software, with several computers running demos. On display were titles such as
the Amiga Developers' CD, Fusion, Genesis, NetConnect (version 3, apparently),
STFax, Pagestream, AmigaWriter, StormC, ImageFX, Tornado3D, Warp3D, StormMesa,
and a recurring demo of Wipeout. FusionPPC is supposedly due out on the 20th of
November. Although non-AmigaOS excitement is now primarily channeled into
LinuxPPC, Fusion could definitely stir up some thrill into those poised to brag
about their Office 98 or VirtualPC or Connectix Virtual Game Station they will
run on their MacOS. Had FusionPPC launched a year or two ago, Amiga could be at
a different place. Same with OS 3.5.

Epic

Epic are converting Simon the Sorcerer 2, a graphical adventure game that was
planned to be released on the Amiga and the CD32 but never saw light of day, to
the Amiga. After perhaps an eternal time of uncertainty and speculation, one
could actually inspect a solidly running version of Simon 2. Considering that
the developer had to code the game from scratch, perhaps by reverse-engineering
the PC version, a lot of steady work has already gone into Amiga Simon 2.
Supposedly, when Epic can get the 500 preorders they need, development will get
a green light and "the author can finish the game by the end of January." For a
game like this, the more modest its system requirements are, the more it will
sel".

Apart from Simon 2, Epic had a fine stand overall, with a large collection of
old games. They also boasted newer software such as MakeCD and Foundation:
Director's Cut, but I really can't make a merry estimation of how much the
latter has sold. A running demo of the new Foundation really wouldn't do any
harm to dispel the prejudice many people harbour against the original
Foundation.

APC&TPC

The APC&TPC stand had some excitement in store. Amiga card game and the numerous
game and scene CD's they had for sale aside, the Phoenix demonstration by the
game's author was amassing groups of people around the clock. The jaw-dropping
demo was running on a BlizzardPPC with a BlizzardVisionPPC chucked in for good
measure, while the code utilized WarpOS and naturally Warp3D to access the 3D
functions of Permedia 2. As if a peak framerate of 70 and a sustainable frame
rate of 60 (which never dropped below 40 fps) weren't enough, you could hoist
the resolution up to 800 x 600 and Phoenix would still run with a peak rate of
65 and a sustainable rate of 40 (never dropping below 35 fps). Real-time enough
for ya? This game definitely got a few Lambda fans converted to Phoenix.

If you haven't seen it, you probably will not believe my description of the
engine. Slam the resolution up to a smooth-scrolling 640 x 480. Fly dangerously
close to tremendous space bases, run rounds around alien spaceships, try your
nervous finger at the trigger, and not a hint of slowdown. The 3D objects, and
space itself, are very colourful, debris pixels whizz insanely by as you
confide in your turbo boost, and you even get rewarded by a lens flare if you
manage the right angle.

Markus Pollmann, the author of Phoenix's engine, is not your everyday gamer who
plays Colony Wars all day on his Playstation and finally says, "Hey why don't we
chalk up something like that for the Amiga?" Contrary to public opinion, he has
been "constantly working on the game till now," and when asked about how one
could find all these algorithms to bring Phoenix souped up to the level of
modern space simulations, his matter-of-fact reply was "You invent them." Unlike
many other games developers who haven't yet seen the light, Markus's game is
programmed in a very clean C++, with which he can "implement the graphical
functions more easily."

As it had already been announced, there will not be Frontier-style trade in the
game, however we will definitely see a host of alien races with an enticing
story to match. Missions are not there yet, but a language for implementing
them is already in place, according to Pollmann. In the completed game you'll
be able to communicate with motherships, destroy space bases and wreak lots of
other havoc. As to how much there is to its completion, collision detection is
already "working very well," although it was shut down for the demo, and enemy
AI is "Okay, but will be better." Beautiful game. For me, the market seems
terribly hungry for a game of this nature; you don't even need to perfect it to
sell a good heap. So go and get Starfighter while you wait for this.

One weird stand had a real Atari SM124 on display, with its back-to-basics OS
smiling from a black-and-white screen.

HEW at large

The Schatztruhe stand was grand enough with its various showcases to draw the
public, and offered a great deal of the most modern Amiga software: Wipeout
2097, DOpus Magellan II, PFS3, Photogenics, Superview, versions of Miami, Amiga
Forever, and the Amiga Unix Compendium. Receiving perhaps more attention than
the DOpus T-Shirts and other novelty items was Urban Mueller advocating his
Aminet CD's and CD-sets. One keeps wondering when an Aminet CD that contains
solely PowerPC software will be able to come forth.

Buhler Electronic, who look as if they've been in the Amiga business since the
beginning of time and are now living their years of nostalgic retirement, were
calmly selling all sorts of peripherals like mice, cables, adapters, accelerator
cards, and even an authentic Commodore 570 CD interface! Hey, GVP530 anyone?

CoolBits constantly had a demo of Wipeout running. If Eat the Whistle hadn't
intervened, Wipeout would be hailed as the first commercial PowerPC game, but
nevertheless, it is always a wonder to behold a 100 percent finished game on a
BlizzardPPC. This race moves fast! Even though Wipeout is not the sort of game
that makes a lot of noise, there was always a small commotion before the
display. Since Clickboom wasn't around, T-Zero was silently for sale on the
shelves of CoolBits, along with VirtualGP, Starfighter, and several more that
could be seen at almost every stand.

Titan Computer's stand emphasized the upcoming Heretic II, running full screen
in 320x200, and surprising Amiga and PC users alike. Heretic II seems to run
perfectly on a BlizzardPPC/233 with a BlizzardVisionPPC. Because "it does not
yet utilize the 3D acceleration," (Warp3D anyone?) it tends to jump frames in
the more complicated scenes. In any case, old Cybervision64 and PicassoIV owners
are not out in the cold just yet. Although the code needs refining, Heretic II
is almost real!

Preordering forms were plenty, not only for Heretic II, but for Evil's Doom SE,
for which insatiable FRP dudes have been drooling for some time now, and Shogo
as well. Other than the good old Amiga CDs on the shelves, some digital effects
products like "Candy Effects for Casablanca" were up for grabs.

RBM Digitaltechnik would gladly sell you useful stuff like an IOBlix, a
ScanExpress, and the like.

The bipartite Albrecht Computer Technik (ACT) stand and the range of hardware
they had to offer was impressive. Some very handy Amiga gadgets were on sale,
such as Zorro boards, Cybervisions, IDEfix interfaces and the new PC mouse
adapter. Even though 060/50 board prices still roamed high, ACT were offering
their Apollo 040 boards for a steal. Get these boards while you can!

Individual Computers, who happily sold innovations like Silver Surfer,
Catweasel, and a new X-Surf for Zorro, occupied a modest stand. Advertised here
was an interesting new product called PPC680x0, which could "convert Amiga
assembler-source-codes straight to PowerPC source-codes."

DCE and KATO Development had also taken their stand with their Twister 1200 and
Melody 1200 Pro banging the speakers out of shape. With the help of a Winamp
clone called AMPlifier, the boards sounded remarkably good.

Eyetech Group Ltd. had what I take to be a Scala MM400 machine with multimedia
stuff on display. EASys, a new Workbench replacement "designed to make using
Workbench easier," said a representative.

Annex, now down to three people, danced twice during the day on a small stage
close to the entrance, enjoying keen attention from many attendants. In
addition to "Keep the Momentum Going," they also danced to the German premiere
of "The Spirit," quite an improvement on the former song.

Neil Bothwick is apparently working for both AmigaActive and Amiga Format "It's
not at all easy to get the magazine on the shelves," he replied when reproached
for the absence of AmigaActive in the rest of the world. "Mostly it is
impossible to distribute the magazine unless newsstands from that country
request it. And how can someone request it, if they don't even know about it?"

The AmigaPlus stand offered both developers' CD's and the German magazine
itself, with an 880KB floppy packed to the brim.

Also catching the surprised eye of many an attentive visitor were the three
wackos strolling around with their Iwin T-Shirts that shouted "Rotten tomatoes
here!" Apparently the community has become rather irritable after the chain of
recent disappointments and broken promises.

Perhaps the most poignant moment of the whole fair was when an Amiga stand
employee with a flaming red face and moist eyes said, "I've sworn, SWORN, that
if I win the lottery, I will sponsor the development of the new Amiga computer
architecture."

           Translation made by Martina Jacobs - Thank you very much!

AMIGA International, Inc.

The booth of Amiga International was way the biggest and most beautiful one the
fair. It took a compressor eight hours to pump up that tremendous Boing-Ball.
The Amiga museum was very interesting, where in addition to all the Amiga
models ever made the "Walker" were exhibited, which never came to production.
The presentation of the operatingsystem update AmigaOS 3.5 was the highlight
and of course it was sold at the show. Also A1200 machines and the popular
Amiga merchandising products were sold.

There were no new Amigas to show and the MCC was off topic, as it became clear
during the weeks before the fair. However, there was a developer machine by
Haage & Partner exhibited inside of a displaycase at the AMIGA booth. This
machine was a POP board from IBM (CHRP), which can be licensed by any developer
who wants to produce a big number of pieces. During an interview Jürgen Haage
said that Haage & Partner is planing a nativ PPC port of AmigaOS after
developing AmgaOS 3.5. The cooperation of AMIGA by giving Haage & Parter the
necessary licenses to do so, is the most important assumption to make this come
true. Haage & Partner already negotiats with AMIGA.

Inside the AMIGA booth guests of Tanja and Taras, Petro's children, were
supported with tasty sausages, coffee and other drinks in an outstanding way.
Petro Tyschtschenko, president of Amiga International, answerd numerous
questions. Many users in a distinct manner showed him their frustration and
temper about Gatway's decision to drop the MCC. Various users felt downright
cheated by those many not fulfiled promises. All this temper were shaked out on
Petro. Surely not an easy job, but in the meantime Petro calles himself a
"manager of crisis". Unfortunatly many users don't think of, that Petro was the
only one who put something into production, for he cared for the development of
the operatingsystem update AmigaOS 3.5 and pushed it.

Certainly not to leave behind the music group ANNEX, who delighted the visitors
of the fair with several songs an their dance-perfomances. In any case to
mention is the visit by Diana and Bob Scharp, who are organizing the Gateway
Computer Shows in St. Louis. Furthermore there were many small sub-boothes with
Amiga, e.g. the one of Amiga-Club im BTX & Internet and the internet café, which
was organizsed by UGN and where the IRC conferences were held - in the meantime
usual for any big show. The IRC conferences were organized by Hendrik Höner and
Christoph Dietz. The machines for the conferences were at their disposal by
Amiga International. At other sub-boothes Amiga magazines like amigaOS,
Amiga-Magazin and AmigActive from England were introduced. AmigaPlus were
represented at another booth. More sub-boothes are discribed seperately below.

Haage & Partner

At the booth of Haage & Partner users got the occation to buy a lot of good
software. Jürgen Haage, his wife an Markus Nerding as well as many co-workers
answered questions of numberless users. For almost every product presentations
were shown at the booth. Survey following:

   * STFax 4.0, the ultimate fax solution with 120 professional announcement
     texts in both, German and English. Many of the features have been enhanced,
     e.g. remote access, fax on demand, forwarding of faxes and background
     printing. Furthermore this version contains an enhanced support for
     USRobotics with improved quality of sound.

   * NetConnect 3.0, the all-in-one internet bundle with Voyager 3.0 incl.
     Java-script, AmIRC 3, NetInfo 2, the new mFTP as well as MetalWeb, the
     WYSIWYG HTML editor.

   * Warp3D, the highly optimized 3D driversystem for CyberVison 3D/Virge3D and
     others.
   * WarpUP, the hightspeed PowerPC kernel for Amiga.
   * StromMESA, an OpenGL compatible graphics library.
   * H&P advertises: The combination of PowerPC, 3D graphics card, WarpOS,
     Warp3D and StormMESA/OpenGL makes your Amiga a highend machine.

   * Storm DSK, the developer survival kit, containing everything indispensable
     for professional development. The bundle includes: StromC 3.0 68K ANSI
     C/C++ Compiler, StormC 3.0 PowerPC ANSI C/C++ Cross-Compiler, StromPowerASM
     68K and PowerPC Cross-Assembler, StormWIZZARD V2.2 as current version of
     the desktop tools, StormMesa - 100% compatible OpenGL library for 68K and
     PowerPC, Developer CD V1.3 incl. the Amiga Refernz Manuals as AmigaGuide,
     PowerPC 68K Emulator Beta-Programm.

   * amigaWriter, the Word Processor with multilingual word-division,
     chapter-management, automatic list of contents, WYSIWYG style footnotes,
     extensive DTP funktions, pattern documents, enhanced printing, spell
     checking with correction propositions and support for TrueType.
     Unfortunatly version 2 wasn´t finished in time before the show.

   * Tornado 3D Version 3.0, the incredible 3D rendering and animation program
     with complete new GUI and an enormous number of features: clothes and
     threads, mannequins (human figures), improved particle system/force fields,
     extended inverse cinematic, sculptor (form editor), support for 3D sounds,
     animation control assistent, project planer, render engines and much more.

   * For graphics the classics VideoFX 2, X-DVE, FontMachine and of course
     ArtEffect 3.0 were sold at the show. The grahics programm for picture and
     video editing and creation of animations, as well as file convertion,
     ImageFX Version 4.1 is new on the list of H&P.

   * Also PageStream 4.0, the all-in-one DTP bundle incl. drawing funktions,
     index and list of contents, PDF export, HTML import/export, chapter
     dependent stile patterns and variables, multiple chapter/page number,
     manual printing, overview printing, visitingcard and lable printing.

   * The AMIGA Developer CD 2.1 containing all the news for AmigaOS 3.5 and for
     the previous versions of the operatingsystem was dearly desired. This
     bundle even includes the StormC 68K C/C++ Compiler Version 3.0 among other
     software and files. However, the CD doesn´t contain the PowerPC-Compiler
     and Power-Assembler, but if you purchase the CD you obtain the opportunity
     to get StromC Version 4.0 for a special price.

   * Even a few hardware were offered. One could buy the graphic tablets and the
     multi I/O card HyperCOM 3+ from VMC, too.

Schatztruhe

At the booth of Schatztruhe of Stefan Ossowski one could see numerous software
and among this a real feast for the eyes: the hand-airbrushed Micronik-Tower of
Heinz Andreolla from Rüti in Swizerland. This tower is absolutly unique. Heinz
took the tower completely apart, and brushed and painted multiple layers inside
and outside of it. The Boing-Balls are sometimes raising, somtimes falling,
sometimes smaller, sometimes bigger, sometimes more pale, and sometimes real
colourful, telling the history of Amiga, which raised in the begining, then was
colourful on top, and - as it looks like by now - slowly disapears into the
underground again.

A special gimmick on the tower is a little Boing-Ball, which rotates around it´s
diagonal axis. This ball is driven by a 3.5 voltage ballbearing-engine. It took
Heinz two month to work out the tower. Also Heinz together with Oliver Tacke is
painting new GlowIcons. Some of the first icons one could already admire at the
show. Unfortunatly a few of the icons are still faulty (too small), but those
will be corrected and available soon.

One could find Urban Müller (Mr. Aminet) at the booth of Schatztruhe, too. We
were able to ask him a number of questions about Aminet, which he moderates
together with Matthias Scheler. We were interested in who is permitted to
upload files to Aminet. Urban explained this to us, and we continued to write
notes on it which we tell you in a summary below.

First of all everybody is of principle permitted to upload an archiv to Aminet.
The archives are collected inside a special directory on the server in
Paderborn. Before the archives get on Aminet - and by this on all mirrors -
those are beeing checked for viruses and corrupt files. Above all they are
verifying if the readme-files are proper. By the way Urban called our attention
to the bad habit to include the version number with the filename. A lot of
programmers are not able to give up this habit. There are two reasons why this
is not good. First the filenames are changing continously and by this programms
are hard to link to each other, and second it becomes harder to search for
previous versions, cause previous version have to become deleted in order not
to let burst the Aminet. So, it would be kind if the version number could be
place inside the readme-file.

Further we asked Urban, why he dosn´t agree with LZX-archives inside the Aminet,
since LZX-archives are smaller than LHA-archives. Urban explained, he will agree
with LZX-archives on Aminet as soon as LZX will be 100% portable to any
operatingsystem. Unfrotunatly this is not possible, yet. What means that a few
operatingsystems would be locked out from using LZX-archives.

Dr. Greg Perry from GP Software answerd questions of DirOpus users. A patch
which fixes problems with AmigaOS 3.5 can be downloaded at the mentioned
webside.

individual computers - Jens Schönfeld

Jens Schönfeld and Jörg ´Schueschmie´ Sendrowski showed us the prototype of the
new ethernet card. This is a full-sized Zorro card containing 10MBit ethernet
and the "usual" expansionports. The card uses RJ45 ("Twisted Pair") as well as
BNC ("thin ethernet" or "Lakritz") connectors. Also interesting is the
SilveSurfer, a serial port for A1200 and Buddha. For the SilverSurfen even an
adapter for A600 is available. This serial port makes up to 460800 Baud, is
MIDI compatible and keeps big Fifos for low CPU charge. Additonal to this
hardware there was a SCMS-Copybit-Killer. The Copybit-Killer allows multiple
digital copying via TOSLINK optical cables between Minidisc, DAT, DCC, CDR and
that is the reason why it is only usable for privat purposes.

Eyetech Group Ltd

Alan Redhouse showed us varaible hardware which is mainly used for industrial
applications. Those are several components and modules which are to plug into
the floppy port. Those keep an image of a bootdisk. He showed us a karaoke
machine which used a small LC display and Scala to display the text of a song,
while the music was played from an integrated CDRom drive. The necessary
hardware sticks into a 19" shelf, hence is optimal for any insdustrial
application. According to Allan Redhouse the Amiga Operatingsystem proved
itself as definite stable and reliable, whereas the use of other systems
brought up problems and crashes again and again.

Amiga Zentrum Thüringen e.V.

Wie talked to Kai Mache and Rolf Hoffmann. The AZT, surely known by some users
from the "Fun of Computing" , mainly calls themself an address for users
wanting to meat and get to know other users, in oder to discuss about their
favourit subject and to help each other with problems. The subject of AZT's
little sub-booth at Amiga definite was Linux. They lend help and the club also
created a CD with all the necessary files to install Linux. Of course there are
thorough manuals on the CDRom, too. The CD can also be ordered after the show
from Thomas Mache, Lindenberg 59, 98693 Ilmenau, at a price of 25,- DM

KATO Development Group

Jörn Plewka, Thorsten Gruner and Thorsten Hansen showed us the new Twister 1200
NG, which is produced by DCE. A multi I/O card with automatic dataflow control
and 460800 baud independent from the CPU in use. Twister 1200 NG is compatible
to the Melody 1200 soundcard.

Further we could astonish at the new Zorro 2-fast-ethernet card Unity Net. Here
some of the specifications: 100 Mbps and 10 Mbps (100Base-TX and 10Base-T),
64kB databuffer, auto-negotiation IEEE 802.3, full autoconfig (no harware
settings needed), full duplex in 10Mbps mode, RJ-45 connection (Twisted Pair),
automatic speed detection inside the network and SANA 2-driver. This card will
be available in late january 2000 at the earliest.

EASys! by Tom Neidhardt

EASys! builds an OS enhancement for the standard Workbench, which is 100%
compatible to OS3.5, and holds many additional features. Here some of the
features: multithreading on WB, www pages as icon, send WB files as email,
internet doc (unfoldable), office doc (unfoldable), system doc including drag
'n drop docs for presentations, editor, printing, and global help, and many
many more. Further details are available by the link above. EASys! Version 4.6
coming soon on CDRom together with extended background stuff. Innovativ (Felix
Schwarz) will deal with the sales. There is a test report for version 3.5 in
amigaOS' issue from mai `99. The provisional product "MARInA" fits well as demo
for snooping into the software, and is available on Aminet in the aminet/util/wb
directory.

Vendors

We had no extended look at the vendors, but tenor of the conversations was, that
there were not enough hardware for sale. Only a few PPC cards, graphics cards
and accelaration cards were available at the fair. Nevertheless, the turnovers
weren't lower than the year before at all, what after all means that the
turnovers might have been much bigger, if there were more hardware for sale at
the show.

At the booth of COOLbits people could purchase software updates from products of
IrseeSoft. Further there were Bühler Elektronik, TGV-Haupt, ACT electronic and
Elbox at the show.

RBM digitaltechnik

First your eyes were catched by the coloured tower cases, which RBM will soon
offer painted with any colour wanted. We couldn't disregard the "Swopper",
which has nothing to do with Amiga at all but nevertheless is interesting.
"Swopper" is a chair like seat, which works like a big round ball, but doesn't
roll away. Unfortunatly at a price of 800 to 900 DM this is a quite expensive
fun.

Certainly ScanQuix 5 were presented. ScanQuix now supports the ICS colour
management and offers further new features. The power failture system AmstroNG
and Towerhawk 1200/4000 were shown, too.

Felix Schwarz von Innovative presented his new graphical editing programm
fxPAINT at the booth of RBM. fxPAINT offers everything necessary for todays
professional designers: painting tools and surfaces, highly comfortable to
operate, many special effects, open concept for enhancements, integrated
modules for convertion and administration of pictures, webdesign tools. fxPAINT
is furthermore the first application fully using the features of OS 3.5 and of
course supports PPC. Felix did an extented presentation for us and we realy
were filled with enthusiasm.

Amiga-Club im BTX & Internet

The Amiga-Club im BTX und Internet takes the task to help Amiga users with all
their problems concerning Amiga. It is important that the members help each
other, by that contacts become closer and a good community is builded. To do so
on the websides of the club a number of forums are available and thats also why
the club were at the show. At their booth at the fair users could ask questions
about any subject, many small problems could be fixed at the booth. The booth
had a lot visitors, and many peoples who knew each other only by the forums had
long conversations. Volker Mohr presented an Amiga laptop, which he put together
himself laborious.

Aaron Digulla presented AROS. AROS is an new implementation of AmigaOS, which is
open-source. Linux is used as developer system, cause it is available for free
and stable, and allows a quite comfortable development of its own source code.
AROS is to imagin as a kind of emulator, emulating the features of AmigaOS
similar to UAE in which UAE builds a hardware emulation, whereas AROS actualy
emulates the operatingsystem.

This project gets ahead only slowly at this time. About 60 % of the work is
done, which mainly is due to that of 60 registered developers only a hand full
gets active on this regular. Many developers are motivated, but there are
problems with time. After all the project progressed far enough that we were
able to play a mine-game. We asked Aaron who else he would like to have in the
team, and of course he said that Olaf Barthel would be great. :-)

APC&TCP Computerclub

The APC&TCP Computerclub offers many performances. Some of this are directly
deald by the central office, others by several members of the club. And quite
that is the power and of course the main meaning of a computerclub. A lot of
members like to help other members. This is done at the users' home or by the
club magazine NoCover, which one could get on disk, via email or from the
homepage of the club.

APC&TCP-sale cares for updates and patches for many programms, and supports
developer of games. At their booth one could purchase a lot of games. Markus
Pöllmann showed a demo of Phoenix, a outerspace game.

Epic Marketing

Epic-Marketing presented the new game "Dafel Bloodline". That is a Zelda like
role game which will support AGA and graphics cards, will use a new sourround
sound system and will contain many aktion elements.

Lukas Hartmann told us about his realtime strategy game "Soeki - The plague",
which he together with Atomatirx (4 ppl) are developing on BeOS and will then
be ported to Amiga, if there will be any moving on. The story of the game is
very extended. It starts with an over-populated earth and a group of peoples
getting teleported to a planet far away. That planet is build out of five
islands, of which one is contaminated radioactive. Of course the people have to
wear protection suites on that contaminated island what later turns out as a
good thing, cause there enrages a virus on each of the islands turning human
into monsters. Only the people wearing protection suites don't get affected by
that virus. Everybody can imagin how the story continues....

We also met Paul Burkey, the programmer of Foundation (now Foundation - The
Directors Cut) at the booth of Epic Marketing. An update for Foundation - The
Directors Cut which will fix little bugs will be realeased soon.

Titan Computer

The highlight at the booth of Titan surely was the presentation of the demo of
Heretic II. This game is beeing ported to Amiga by Hyperion Software. The
programmers Thomas and Hans-Jörg Frieden as well as Christian Sauer told us,
that a fast PowerPC and for the best a 3D graphics card is recommended for the
game, as for Shogo.

Ingo Kleefisch presented his morphing programm "Fantastic Dreams", which now
even can save single sequences as animations. Also the programmers of the well
known CDR-software "BurnIt", Michael Siegel and Axel Deising, were at the booth
of Titan. Michael Garlich, the chief of Titan-Computer, told us the decision of
Gateway not to develope the MCC anymore put him to worse, cause he believed in
those promises and invested a lot of money for licenses.

                                    Summary

As you surely could read between the lines of the short previews, the show
wasn't a "banger". All in all less visitors, only on saturday there were a
quite good visitation. This time appearently only those people have come to the
show who realy wanted to buy someting or to talk to the developers and to meet
other Amiga users. As one could imagin before there were no single sign of the
revolutionary development we heard about long time ago. Nevertheless, there are
some good starts, but unfortunatly all this is still not "to hand", nothing we
would be able to buy here and today. I talked to many users who came with a lot
of money to the show, but left it again with the money. This in mind I'm
astonished by the vendors beeing quite satisfyed by their turnovers not less
than previous jear. This shows definite that there is a existing marked. It
would be nice if something "real" would be brought to this ma ging new starts
(PPC) would realy come to development, because for me I'm fed up with those
keep-up-slogans any way. OS 3.5 is a begining, but now the developers of
hardware must come along.

This show was a great experience for me. I got to know an incredible number of
people personaly who I only knew by email or phone before. I had a lot of
intense and extended conversations, which gave me a better understanding of a
number of interrelations. I want say thank you very much for the kindness I
recieved everywhere. This all was great fun for me and motivated me to go on
with Amiga News. One word about those many rumours at the show, as usual at any
show. Certainly I've heard some, but I rather stick to facts and will wait until
I'm able to report facts.

I hope that I didn't forget anybody or anything important, and that I didn't
confuse specifications or anything else. If so, please sent me a short email.
(ps)

                          WIPEOUT 2097 TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, as Wipeout2097 has been released, it's time to release some trouble
shooting information as well. We expected all the time, that it will be a tricky
thing to make the game working, just like making any Warp3D application working,
because it depends on so many external factors. The game itself does most often
not cause the problems itself, but an inproper configuration of those external
components often cause many more problems.

I would appreciate, if this newsletter is spread, so that people will be able to
resolve their problems as soon as possible.

First of all, there is a support email address mentioned in the WO docs. People
having problems should mail to this address, it's directly linked to the
developers email address (so I will get them and will reply usually in the same
day). Up to now we were able to solve most problems. Note, that I won't continue
a discussion in the NG's, so anyone wanting to reply, please use private mail
(preferably sam_jordan@spin.ch).

In the documentation there is also a trouble shooting chapter which might solve
some problems.

If some of the serious problems get solved, then a patch will be released.

Known problems:

   * Accidentally we forgot to bump the version number of a library inside the
     Warp3D archive on CD (only production release), which can lead to heavy
     problems. To avoid problems, first *delete* the file
     libs:Warp3DPPC.library and afterwards install the Warp3D archive on CD.
     Besides that, if you already had W3DV2 installed, then you don't need the
     new archive. The new archive does only do two things:
      * provides a chroma test feature, which helps in displaying transparency
        correctly
      * fixes a problem when resizing the window

   * Second major problem: quite often, standard versions of CyberGfx aren't
     enough to play the game reliable, this is also valid for other Warp3D
     applications.

     Users with CV3D (yes, we got a lot of reports from satisfied Virge users)
     should either use Picasso96 or CyberGraphx4, as CGFX3/CV3D is almost
     completely unsuitable for 3d acceleration, because it doesn't support the
     bitmapcache feature.

     CVPPC/BVPPC: CGFX3 users should definitely download the *latest*
     cgxsystem.library and monitor driver from ftp.phase5.de, IIRC only these
     files don't have any problems at all (might also solve the 'not enough
     video memory' problem). CGFX4 users should make sure to have at least a
     monitor driver 4.0 beta 4 installed.

     Furthermore CGFX must be configured correctly. Dragging must be disabled
     and the bitmapcache feature must be enabled, otherwise no Warp3D
     application can work. All messages of the kind 'not enough video memory',
     'failed to open screen/window', 'failed to allocate bitmap' are definitely
     problems arising due to CyberGfx configuration problems.

   * Very important: make sure to *not* have a very large/very deep workbench
     and many window open when starting the game, otherwise the game won't have
     enough video memory and will reload the textures during the game. The game
     will then run at a few fps, and will display corrupt textures. A black
     screen, where 3d objects should be displayed, might also indicate a video
     memory shortage problem. As an example: I usually start the game with a
     1024*768*16 workbench, with not more than 1-2 not too large windows open,
     this is enough to run the game with triple buffering and max. texture
     memory set (certainly only for 8MB boards).

   * Then there is a powerpc.library in the Warp3D archive on the production CD.
     *Don't* touch it, it should have been removed, it's a quite old library.

     If you already had WarpUp 4 installed, then you shouldn't touch the WarpUp
     archive on CD either (it's the same). You might accenditally change some
     configuration variables, which could lead to problems.

   * There is another problem with the game concerning memory consumption.
     Although the game itself can be configured to eat less than 20MB
     (exclusive WarpUp memory consumption), it turned out that for a lot of
     people with even 32MB there were stability problems (the exact reason is
     unknown yet), so I definitely wouldn't recommend to buy the game when only
     24MB are present. 32MB users should make sure to reduce the 'texture memory
     slider' to a small value, because this doesn't only save video memory, but
     also fast memory. Additionally use double buffering instead of triple
     buffering if memory shortage might be expected (or try window mode).

     Of course, buying more RAM is another suitable solution. That's even more
     important, as it seems as some of the upcoming 3d games will even require
     64MB of RAM. This way stability problems of WO2097 could also be resolved.

   * If you get graphics errors (smearing, flashing), then you have most likely
     some patches/hacks installed, remove them. Other potential sources of such
     effects are too old CGFX files.

   * CD audio: right now we know, that for some IDE drives CD audio doesn't
     work. We currently don't know of any reliable possibility to play audio
     CD's, but the problem is investigated. If anyone has a good pointer to
     reliable audio CD playing functions we might integrate them and release a
     patch.

   * Performance: if you feel that the game doesn't run as fast as you would
     like it to run, then you can adjust some settings, mainly:
      * reduce view distance (F3)
      * enable fogging, reducing overdraw (F6)
      * disable filtering (F7)
      * reduce resolution

     Here some notes concerning WO2097 AMIGA efficiency: a lot of work was spent
     to accelerate the game as much as possible, and we can finally say that the
     efficiency is definitely better than the one of the PC version. The main
     slowdown reasons for now are on the one side the quite low fill rate of
     the Permedia2 and on the other side the slow bus systems (compared to
     other architectures). That's important because WO2097 has a really high
     polygon count, and every single vertex (point) of a polygon needs 30-40
     bytes to be transferred to the chip. More reasons are a lack of L2 cache
     (as the game deals with big memory areas internally), frequent cache
     flushes due to context switches and the context switches themselves, which
     take up a few milliseconds. So we had to compensate all these bottlenecks
     and I would say that we were successful in doing that. A plain port would
     have resulted in a very disappointing performance, that's for sure.

Hopefully we will see future OS versions, which will integrate all these new
technologies in a proper way, so that all this mess can be avoided. The goal
should be, that a game is installed and then simply works. I'm afraid that this
is impossible today, when talking about high-end games. But please, have
patience, consult the support (blame those people writing bad reports without
having contacted the support/developers first and which don't have any clue what
it means to develop high-end games for *AMIGA*), ask other people, and finally
you will manage to solve the problems, because other people also did it. And if
you once have a working system, then other similar games (like those coming from
Hyperion software) should work then without problems.

So all people have a lot of fun!
