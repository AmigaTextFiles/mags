Welcome to World of Amiga Special! This issue is all about celebrating
the Amiga's birthday, and those of you that remember our Christmas issue
will no doubt remember also that we make a right old cock up of making
it christmassy :)

But you all know why that was, don't you? And we've made every attempt
to make this issue as memorable and as Amiga-Birthday-Related as
humanly possible (although some would argue we're not human at WOA :)

Anyway, as usual, here's a brief rundown of some of the best bits of
this Special WOA Issue:

   · Interviews! Lots of them. From Kermit Woodall to Wayne Hunt!

   · Loads of one-off tutorials from various Amiga experts

   · Exclusively written articles from loads of well known Amigans

   · Reviews of famous Amiga products

   · And loads more!

We've added headers and footers to all articles, and made the titles
bold, we've started crediting reviews and tutorials to the people who
wrote them. Features and Editorials aren't credited because it's a
pretty safe bet that they're written by me (Neil) or if that's not
true, then the article will be credited accordingly.

We've gone and recruited 3 new members of staff as writers. The first,
Frank Mathieson, has started off his new post here at WOA with some
nice serious reviews on some of the newest things to be released
lately, namely, OXYPatcher, IOBlix-1200 and more! Joe Solinsky has
started his regular column which should be of use to those of you
wanting to learn ARexx.

And to top it all, we've gone and bought back the best news section
ever, with archives dating back to when this issue was started, so you
don't miss a thing!

So after all that, you'd better enjoy it :)

Neil Bullock,
Editor
