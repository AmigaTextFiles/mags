E-Mail Listings
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Here is a short list of my favorite Amiga related E-Mailing lists.

The Amiga Format Bulletin
-------------------------

This is run by the editor of Amiga Format, Ben Vost. This is a great
mailing list with about 550 to 600 subscribers at the time of writing.
This listing is full of the latest Amiga news and questions for people to
answer, you can also post your own messages or answers to peoples questions
or reply to someones posting. Don`t think that it is purely about Amiga`s,
it also has other Off-Topic threads such as things about maths and just
general humour :) WARNING - Lots of people join and then unsubscibe when
they realise how many mails they will get a day. Everyday from the AFB
alone, i get around 120 to 150 mails a day!

For information on joining the AFB, goto:
<http://www.egroups.com/group/afb>

The Blitz Listing
-----------------

If you use the Blitz Basic programming language, then this is the listing
for you. It is full of useful information and questions by other Blitz
users. You can post your own information, source code, questions or answers
to other peoples questions. You do not just get mails about Blitz, as with
other listings you do get the occasional Off-Topic thread. You do not get
too many mails per day, I get anywhere between 10 to 30 e-mails a day from
this list.

To subscribe to the Blitz List, send a message to:
<blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

The WOA-DM listing
------------------

It is the official World Of Amiga Disk Magazine E-Mail listing. There are
not many subscribers so there isn`t much mail from this list, so please, if
you want the latest in information on this disk mag then join this list.

For information on joining the WOA-DM, goto:
<http://www.egroups.com/group/woa-dm>

The Amiga-C listing
-------------------

If you are into C programming but you can`t find any Amiga related info
then this is the list for you. There are about the same number, if not
sightly more, mails floating around per day than the Blitz listing. This is
a very useful listing.

For info on this list visit: <www.onelist.com> and search for <Amiga-C>
