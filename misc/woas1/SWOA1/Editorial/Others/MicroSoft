Microsoft On Amiga...

Wouldn't it be brilliant if all PC's and Macs went out of existence?
That would mean that either Microsoft took to developing software
for toasters, or developing for the Amiga, and wouldn't that be funny?

They would no longer be able to use their own backdoor trickery to get
their OS to do exactly what they wanted it to do. They wouldn't be
able to program those overly-huge executables, they'd have to keep them
small, after all that's one of the good points of the Amiga.

They'd have to get used to using Rastports, Bitmaps and system friendly
windows, rather than using their highly processor over-intensive
routines which never seem to be the same in the various programs.

And, of course, they'd have to realise that almost any type of software
they'd care to create has probably already been created for the
Amiga. OS's, Word Processors, Text Editors, DTP Programs, Office
Suites, Internet related programs, and loads more.


Luckily, I don't think Microsoft would either get a warm welcome to
the platform, or actually want to come to it in the first place.
And that can only be a good thing.
