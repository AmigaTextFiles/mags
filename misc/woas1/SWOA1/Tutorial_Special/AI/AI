[1mArtifical Intelligence[0m

As you probably know, a computer doesn't have a brain. The closest thing it
has is the processor, and that's about as capable of making intelligent
decisions as a giraffe is at walking on it's back legs only.

So, when it comes to giving the computer intelligence, the best you are
going to get is getting it to make an informed decision. And how exactly
would you go about this?

Well, it's pretty easy really. There are books all over the place on this
subject which claim that Artificial intelligence is hard to implement.
It isn't. It's very easy. All you need to remember is that the computer
cannot think for itself and you're half way there.

However, while remembering a simple fact about the computer may seem
easy, that's not all there is to it. You then have to get your computer
to make an informed decision. And how do you get anything to make an
informed decision? Give it information to base its decision on.

This applies to any form of AI which you intend to program. Be it a
program to calculate the multiplication of two numbers, or a game
routine deciding where a little person will go next depending on where
it's just been, and in accordance with its surroundings.

Now those are two very different types of program, but amazingly, the
same principle applies to both. You have to give the computer information
before it can make any decisions for you.

The information is very different of course. With the first example, you
give the computer 2 numbers and it will work them out, with the second
you actually don't give it any information at the time the calculation
is carried out.

If you were programming something like Theme Park, which admittedly
is something much too complex to put in a magazine which is supposed to
cater for both experts and beginners like this one.

Say you were trying to get one little person in the Theme park to
decide where to go from its current position. Using artificial intelligence
would have got himm there in the first place, so you have to carry on
the AI from the that point.

Ok, the person enters the park. What does he do? Walk down the path as
far as possible until he gets to a junction. When what does he do?
Ok, at this point you would get the computer to choose from a pre
prepared list of rides which were available in the park for people to
go on.

But then what? Well, you would get this little person to head towards
that ride. But of course, the path might not go straight there,
so the person would need to take an appropriate turn at any junctions
he came to and head in the general direction of the ride he wanted
to get to and eventually, he would end up there.

But on the way, there would be many more things to take into account
such as whether the person was getting bored, which would probably
be some form of equation based on how long the person had been in the
park and how many enjoyable rides the person had been on since he'd
been there.

Now, that's just one example of how artificial intelligence could be
used in a game. But artificial intelligence is not always things like
that. It can be as simple as detecting whether the a string has any
characters in it or not.

Originally, I was going to make this some form of programming lesson,
but upon figuring that not everyone has a copy of Blitz Basic 2.1,
I decided to make it theory only, which makes it significantly easier
to explain.

All in all, AI is very easy to accomplish, and now we've explained the
basics, I expect some good games coming our way in our wonderful
competition for the Amiga's birthday.
