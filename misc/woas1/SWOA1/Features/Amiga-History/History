[1mThe Amiga History[0m

For those who don't know, the Amiga once was the most popular small/home
computer of all time. To a certain extent, it still is very popular, but
only to those who have familiarised themselves with it's excellent list of
features. The reason for this is that the majority of people have been
sucked in by the quite frankly awful 'operating system' which exists on the
PC. Regular readers will know what I'm talking about. Yes, Microsoft Windows.

However, from the humble beginning, the Amiga owners (Commodore, who did not
originally start as owners) kept everything about their Amiga project very
secret, infact, Commodore were denying the existence of the Amiga 3000 up
until 10 minutes before it was released!

This was, in part, a reason for the demise of Commodore. No-one ever knew
what was going on. If they were developing a new machine no-one knew, if
they were idle, still no-one knew. This had the potential to cause a
horrific downfall in interest in Commodore products, the theory being if
no-one knew if Commodore were doing anything, they would lose interest.

That is one thing that the new Amiga company have rectified. Latest news of
their upcoming products such as OS3.5 are available on their website at
regular intervals (www.amiga.com/amigaos35/)

Back to the past now, and how did the Amiga start off? Well a lot of you
will know all this from previous features in magazines, so I'll keep it
brief. The Amiga was originally started by a group of people, however, they
ran into financial difficulties and requested help from various companies,
one of which was Atari.

Atari felt they could revolutionise the computer market with the Amiga, but
Commodore stepped in and stole the Amiga right from under Atari's nose,
which angered Atari and made the Amiga and all future Atari computers bitter
rivals, although the Amiga, in most cases, won the battle of this rivalry.

So what did Commodore do with the machine? Released the A1000. A machine
with 256K of memory was very powerful back in 1985, but with the
staggeringly high price tag of nrealy 2000 pounds, it wasn't particularly
successful. The next Amiga was to be the most successful ever. The A500.

The A500 came out wiyth 512K of memory, but when supplies of the machine
ran out, Commodore decided to put A500+ machines in A500 boxes, and give a
lot of people (including me) a surprise in 1991 when they opened their A500
box and found a completely different model!

Well, this isn't completely true, the A500+ was essentially the same as the
A500 except for the chipset and memory capability. The A500+ had Kickstart
2.04 as well... Ok, so not very similar to the A500 after all :)

THE ESCOM ERA
-------------

Anyway, Commodore kept releasing machines, to which the Amiga public
responded by buying them until one day, Commodore went Bankrupt. The bit
that follows (about Escom) may include strong language... if you are easily
offended, please skip to the first occurrence of the word 'Gateway' :)

Escom made a proper cock up of the Amiga. First thing they did was start
producing Amiga 1200's. What happened to developing a new machine! More
bloody A1200's in the shops! Although they are responsible for Amigas still
being on sale now.

Of course, Escom went bankrupt in the end, and good riddance is what
I say! See, not too much strong language (hardly any infact :)

GATEWAY
-------

While they may no longer want anything to do with the computer, they do
own the Amiga assets. Gateway created two new companies to deal with the
Amiga side of things, who have now joined as one and moved away from
their parent company to a completely different area of America.

Amiga now handles Research and Development, future production, Public
relations and all that sort of stuff. They were practically stationary
for the first two years they owned the Amiga (97-98), now they seem
to be getting on track.

Workbench 3.5 is going to (hopefully) released in August with public
beta testing beginning in May (www.amiga.com/amigaos35/ - sign up now!)
And we're hoping that thig November will see the introduction of the
Amiga Developer machine.

And then, we're cautiously excited about the fact that new Amiga
hardware could be available to the masses early next year. I've started
saving, so I can give you the low down on the machine when it becomes
available.

I hope you'll still be here when the machine arrives...
