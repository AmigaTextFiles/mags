[1mNapalm
[0m

Probably the most long awaited game of recent months is finally here,
and we've been able to get a copy of it to review. Napalm. It's
pretty amazing what they can do with computers nowadays, as Napalm
kind of proves. One PC-person who saw a demo of the game said the
graphics were rubbish. I kindly pointed out that the 2x2 pixel blocky-
ness of Napalms closest rival (C&C) looked far worse. And it does.

Napalms plot is really no different to the game that started it all,
Dune II. That game had you building bases, killing enemies and
mining a substance to gain credits to do all the other things you
needed to do. Command and Conquer has you doing exactly the same
thing, and so does Napalm.

Command And Conquer (in some people's opinions) improved upon the
original Dune II, and I think Napalm has improved upon C&C rather
a lot. For a start, it works on the Amiga. The graphics are way, way
better than C&C and it doesn't need anywhere near the spec that
C&C needs to run.

OK, so its a pretty demanding game. I spent the best part of a day
figuring out that I needed to kill all running Commodities in Work-
bench and reduce WBs depth from 256 colours to just 2 before Napalm
would work.

Anyway, Napalm consists of two teams. The Humans and the Robots. The
humans, when you look through the little booklet that accompanies
the Napalm CD, seem to be inferior. This is why I started playing as
the Robots to start with.

It would probably be a good idea to start as the humans to familiarise
yourself with the game and it's engine. It took me about 3 attempts
to get past the first level, partly because I'm crap at strategy games
until I get REALLY used to them, and partly because the game is damn
hard.

The enemy intelligence is possibly the best seen in an Amiga game
ever. They are very intelligent things, and like all other computer
games seem to, Napalm also seems to cheat. How else could the enemy
keep on repairing a building for over an HOUR when they had no means
of gaining more credits?

Speaking of credits, you get them in the usual way. Mine something and
refine it. The substance in question in Napalm is simple oil. None
of this made up crap like Spice and Tiberium etc. but I suppose that's
partly due to the fact that the game is based on Earth rather than
some distant planet no-one has ever heard of.

The terrain you play on is excellently drawn/rendered. It looks almost
real at times, and the level of detail throughout the game is
astounding. When the little men die, they tend to fall to the floor
in 1 of 3 (or maybe more, I've only noticed 3) ways, blood spurts
across the ground and after a while, gradually soaks into the ground
and their limbs rot away. Lovely.

And the killing part of the game is particularly fun. There's loads
of different types of unit you can use to spread your destruction, and
even the men on this game are good to fight with, especially the
flamer men who are on some of the screenshots in this review (if you're
using the LhA download version, the screenshots are in the directory
you found the review in).

Something that has been missed from a lot of games is the ability for
a network game. And although Napalm doesn't yet have this facility,
clickBOOM have saved a space for it so they can release an update
which allows network play in the future. You can always have a game
over the serial ports if you have two suitably enhanced Amiga's, or
maybe even a PC with UAE.

Nice touches in the game include fake buildings designed to confuse
the enemy so they start attacking the fakes while you build up suitable
protection around your real base. You get air vehicles in Napalm such
as helicopters, 'Antigrav' devices, and if you're playing on the side
of the robots you get some truly brillaint units.

UFO's are excellently rendered units which fly through the sky. There
are two types, supply and attack. The supply UFO brings reinforcments
to your aid so you can heighten your attack on the ground, while
the attack UFO hovers over the building you tell it to, while releasing
deadly photon beams totally destroying the building in a stunning
mixture of graphics and sound.

They've really thought of everything. Nuke missiles, camouflage
for buildings, tunnels for underground travel to areas of the battle
field, imaginative extraction of oil, and more. And hopefully, there'll
be a lot of updates to this game, first to fix the apparent bugs such
as the computer only saying 'unit ready' when a new unit stops
moving. You can intercept a unit exiting the factory they were made in
and theoretically move them across the level before the compter says
'unit ready'.

There's not many bugs, but the ones that are there are a bit niggly.
The control system is OK, if a bit awkward at times, and the speech
is very good. Overall, a true work of brilliance. If you have an
Amiga powerful enough for it, then buy it. If you don't have an
Amiga powerful enough, then buy one.

Overall: 94%
