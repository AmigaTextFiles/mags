It's that time again. The time when I can be bothered to write articles
for WOA. And this stays for about 3 months, and unfortunately, at
about the same time comes the stint of completely cack typing and the
time where I make about 3000 typos in a 1500 word article. But
that has absolutely nothing to do with the review.

Racing on computers has often been a pretty crappy experience. Most
of the games just don't allow you the fun you want to have in a virtual
car. You want to be able to spin around so far that you can see the
front of your car, and you want nearly realistic graphics to boot.

Well, XTR has this, and more. The ability to turn around 360 degrees
(and go the wrong way around a race course) and do so at a very fast
speed and get some sort of excitement while doing so. That's what
a driving game should be like.

Not boring and monotonous like the Lotus series where you could turn
about 30 degrees either left or right and go forward and that was
it. This is the type of racing game that everyone ought to own.

The game is a variant of the typical racing type game. You get weapons
and it allows you to go around shooting at the other cars. Of course,
the weapons need to be picked up from large icons on the ground before
you use them.

These large icons on the ground give you a randomly selected weapon
from a choice of about 15. These range from homing missiles, normal
missiles, banana skins, mines, bombs, and even sheep which run around
the course and kill anything they touch, while killing themselves
in the process.

You get a choice of game, Single Race, Cup Race, etc. And there's
even a deathmatch where you and up to three friends participate in a
large arena, and try to notch up the biggest number of kills to
win. There are 8 characters to choose from, each with a different
car, and there are loads and loads of other options.

Overall, this is a brilliant game, and well worth a look.
