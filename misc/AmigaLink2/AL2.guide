     March has been an incredible --and hectic-- month at Amiga Link.  We
 started off the month with a bang by hiring a new technical editor, Roy
 Millican!  Roy then promptly proceeded to write two articles, set up a
 mailing list for Amiga Link, and placed Amiga Link on five WWW pages!
 Look in the distribution page of this magazine for more info.  
 
 
     It was one week later when hell began to freeze over: the Emplant
 e586 module was finally released.  After months of hearing claims of "Just
 one more month," thousands of people finally received their shiny new e586
 modules.  Utilities Unlimited, neglected, however, to ship the neccesary
 ROM BIOS with the e586, and soon the praises that had been given to Jim
 Drew turned to hate.  
  
  
     As if that wasn't enough to give the Amiga community a collective
 heart attack, we then received some of the best news we've had in months:
 The C= buyout was FINALLY going to end.  This is not an April Fool's joke,
 people, even we're not so demented as to make up something of such grand
 importance as this.  The latest news is that on April 20, in New York
 City, there will be an auction for C= and all the technology and products
 that go with it.  The starting bid will be Escom's, and all other bidders
 may enter bids, as long as they are at least one million dollars more than
 Escom's bid.  Then, on April 21, also in New York City, a court hearing
 will take place to accept the highest bid for C=.  This is not expected to
 take too long, and should run with relatively few problems.  Once the New
 York courts accept the bid, it goes to the Bahamian court, where it will
 presumably be accepted, bringing the C= buyout to a CLOSE!  I, for one,
 can't wait!
 
     
     The public court hearing will be held at:  Room 610-2 of the United
 States Bankruptcy Court, The Old Customs House, One Bowling Green, New
 York, New York, on April 21, at 10:00 a.m.  I, as well as a few other
 Amiga users, will probably be at the meeting; if you are interested in
 going, and would like to meet us there, please e-mail me!  I'd love to
 see you there.
     
    
     Anyway, keep your chin up, have a stiff upper lip (whatever that
 means!) and hug and kiss your Amiga every day, telling it that you love it
 with all your heart.  
 
     Until next month!
     
     
          Joshua Galun
         Editor-in-Chief
         

  
      First, I would like to thank the sysops who voluntered to distribute
 the magazine.  
 
 
     We have some good news for people living in the East coast.
 The auction with Escom and the other bidders will take place in NYC!
 The other Chief Editor is planning to go to the auction!  I might too.
 We will try to upload a textfile saying who won the auction.  And last but
 not least I would like to thank you, the reader. 
  
          John Vlachos
         Editor-in-Chief
                               
                               
     Note for those confused readers who are wondering who is the REAL
 Editor in Chief of Amiga Link.  Actually, John and I are BOTH the Editors
 in-Chief.  However, we both handle different aspects of the magazine, John
 more along the lines of spreading the news about the mag, uploading the
 mag to assorted BBSs, and handling the BBS list and letter's column,
 whereas I handle the content of the magazine, get the articles, and edit
 the magazine.

     I believe that the CD32 has been the greatest product that C= ever
 made, with the A3000 coming a close second.  I know that I have already
 incited thousands of A500 owners to take up their pens (or word
 processors!) and start writing to me, but hold on a sec.  Look at what the
 CD32 has done for the Amiga.  First of all, the CD32 is a potential cash
 cow.  For every CD32 game that is sold, C= gets money from it.  That may
 not seem like a lot, but how do you think Nintendo managed to get profits
 in the billions in the late 80s?  It wasn't from selling Nintendos at $90,
 let me tell you that.  Of course, C= won't make as much money, because
 they charge less in royalties, and because there were more Nintendos than
 there are CD32s, but it's still a start.  With that money, the new owners
 could pay for new advertising campaigns or lower the price of Amigas and
 CD32s.
 
     The CD32 has already brought the Amiga one great advantage despite
 the low number sold.  That is the boost that it has given to Amiga games.
 In recent months, fewer and fewer Amiga games have been made, but the CD32
 games just keep on coming, and they are good (or atleast better than many
 normal Amiga games).  This has also brought the Amiga up with the CD-ROM
 revolution on the PCs and Mac in a short space of time.  Had the CD32
 never come out, we'd have no standard Amiga CD setup, and many fewer CD
 titles, perhaps none at all.  
 
     And finally, the CD32 has the potential to make the Amiga a household
 name.  We've all heard of Sega and Nintendo, so why not Amiga?  The CD32
 was even written up at one point in Playboy (although I can't imagine how
 many people we're reading Playboy)!  That kind of press functions even
 better than advertisements on TV.  Sega has relatively few ads but has
 sold incredibly well.  It's obvious that people buy based on what they
 read and by what the see at their friend's house, not from TV.
 
     So, to the new owners, whoever they be, get out the CD32s!  Start
 selling them for $200 and £175 in the UK.  Start selling them in every
 electonic's chain across the world.  Start giving them to magazines free
 so that they can review CD32 games (hint hint!).  Do everything you
 can.  In the end, the CD32 may save the Amiga.

REVIEW

                           @{b}In the Beginning...@{ub}

    I love space sagas.  Not that politically-correct garbage like the new
 Star Trek shows, where we've managed to solve all our problems with peace
 and love and old-fashioned American capitalism.  I love the stories of 
 vast empires, of cataclysmic battles, and of great leaders.  I love Star
 Wars and Gundam.  That's how Reunion caught my eye.  It promised to go 
 beyond simple military conflict (a la Wing Commander), and deal with 
 exploration, trade, colonization, and an important long-term goal.  It 
 looked fantastic.  I had no doubt in my mind that it would be a fantastic 
 adventure in interstellar space.
 
    Here's the story.  Earth was experiencing a period of great peace.  The
 United Nations had successfully quelled all war, and as the world turned 
 to peace, people looked upward.  (At this point it starts to sound like 
 ST:TNG or SeaQuest bullshit.... It gets better, read on.)  Humanity's next
 step was obviously to the stars.  Exploration vessels were sent out to map
 the cosmos and find other worlds on which humanity might live.  Finally,
 two suitable planets were discovered, and two great colony ships were sent
 forth to claim them.  One ship disappeared mysteriously and was presumed 
 lost.  The other ship encountered an errant field of asteroids and was 
 severely damaged.  The occupants escaped to the surface of their new home,
 without the advanced technology which lay on board the ship.  Earth, 
 unfortunately, was in no position to help.  In the meantime, you see, 
 people there became strangely hostile, and many wars ravaged the planet.  
 Oops.
 
    All of this happened centuries ago.  New Earth has crawled back from 
 the primitive level which was forced upon it, and a great civilization has
 sprung forth.  You are, of course, the dictator of New Earth, and it's 
 your job to find out what the heck happened to the old one.  Not a small 
 task.
 
                             @{b}At First Sight@{ub}
                             

    The game starts showing you standing over a holographic projection
 table.  This is your command room, and it is from here that you issue your
 orders to the forces of New Earth.  A row of buttons on top and a set of 
 "hot zones" on the screen allow you to access the other menus and displays
 through which you control your civilization.  Initially you are alone, but
 in order to get anything accomplished you need to hire a set of advisors: 
 a builder, a pilot, a warrior, and a scientist. You can choose from three
 different candidates for each position, a cheap and unskilled one, one
 with moderate skills and cost, and an expensive but powerful one.  These  
 advisors don't really offer much advice, but are needed in order to build 
 structures, conduct research, pilot ships, and fight wars.  Once you have 
 procured them they will huddle about you, looking like the generals in 
 Powermonger.
 
    Here's my first quip, your advisors are stupid. Very stupid.  You can
 send them to the university, and they still come back stupid.  This 
 becomes apparent when you have a conversation with them.  These 
 "conversations" take place through a menu system of possible questions and
 commands.  Most of them are useless.  For example, if you ask them how 
 they are they will either tell you that they have everything that they 
 need, or they complain that they want more money.  There is NO WAY to give
 them more money!  Once you've paid their price they become your permanent
 slaves, no salary is needed, or possible for that matter.  The only cost  
 they incur is when you pay their tuition when you send them to the 
 university.  You can also ask them what you should do next.  They NEVER 
 EVER give ANY useful information.  They only tell you to research stuff 
 that you haven't already (duh), or they tell you everything's fine.  The 
 whole conversation aspect of the game is pointless and wasted.
 
    If you feel the need to relax, there's a pub next door.  You won't be
 doing much there.  The few people there you can talk to have very little 
 to say, and will sometimes repeat the same thing until the end of the 
 game.  After a while a spy will show up, whom you can hire to give you 
 information on other races' colonies and fortifications.  A pirate shows 
 up later, and you can send him on a few preset missions for small amounts 
 of ore or weapons.  At one point in the game the bar becomes incredibly 
 useful, allowing you to halt hostilities with an entire race of aliens.
 Unfortunately the place is so damn boring you probably won't go there 
 often enough to notice.

                      @{b}Where Does the Fire Station Go?@{ub}


    The first display you'll probably access is the land display.  This is 
 a Sim City-esque view of your colony, showing rivers, trees, sand dunes, 
 etc., as well as your buildings.  You need to erect structures to give 
 your colonies various abilities, and your citizens will periodically 
 demand public works (We demand a stadium! Sound familiar?). Basic needs 
 such as food or shelter must be supplied.  Mines must be built to supply 
 the raw materials needed to build spacecraft and weapons.  New Earth's 
 settlement comes well supplied with basic facilities, but will need 
 upgrading periodically to cope with your expanding population.  New 
 colonies must be built from scratch.
 
    Once again, you are hit with a sense of pointlessness (just like the
 C= buyout! -Josh).  It doesn't matter WHERE you build your buildings, 
 it never effects how your colony functions.  The map only serves to 
 limit the number of buildings you can have, which becomes really
 aggravating when you're forced to fit buildings in like a jigsaw puzzle.  
 This is supposed to be the surface of a PLANET for crissakes!  What kind 
 of planet has only 25 square kilometers of surface area???  You should be 
 able to build ROADS and BRIDGES and CITIES!  Unfortunately Reunion's 
 surface display is little more than a fancy means of limiting your
 colonies to ridiculously small levels. 

                            @{b}Subliminal Learning?@{ub}


    Once you've built New Earth up enough to support space exploration, you
 need to research the technology for it.  This is done by listening to 
 compact discs.  I am not kidding.  Research consists of going to the 
 research screen, pushing a CD into a player, and watching a nifty 
 frequency analyzer display.  If only real research were like this.  After 
 listening to the CD, a vector display of what you just researched pops up 
 on your holographic projector (this is its only use).  This looks cool but
 does not really add much to the game.
 
    The annoying thing about Reunion's R&D system is that you CANNOT
 research new technologies until the computer decides you can.  Many
 technologies can't even be developed by you, but must be obtained 
 elsewhere.  Sorry, if I can develop spacecraft on my own I DAMN WELL can 
 develop something as primitive as a tank!

                         @{b}Keep Our Jobs at Home!@{ub}


    Now we hop over to the building screen, where you can see the same 
 nifty vector graphic as well as a bitmapped image of the product.  
 Building stuff is simply a matter of clicking on a purchase button and 
 selecting how many you want.  The amount you can build is limited by the 
 amount of money (from taxing you citizens) and raw materials you have. 
 Sometimes a support system must be built for you to build the item.  A 
 space station, for instance, must be built before you can build a cruiser,
 and each station can build only one cruiser at a time.  It takes time to 
 build each item, so don't expect stuff to just appear.
 
    It is here that you hit one of the stupidest oversights in the game. 
 You can build things only  on New Earth.  No matter how advanced your 
 colonies are, even if they have a HIGHER level of technology than your 
 home world, they can't construct so much as a miner droid!  They just 
 can't!  This means that in order to build a defense force for other 
 colonies YOU HAVE TO BUILD IT AT HOME AND THEN SHIP IT ALL OVER!  This is 
 too much of a pain in the ass.  I just left my colonies undefended.

                          @{b}Mapping the Armada@{ub}


    So, we've built our spaceships; now let's sally forth into the cosmos!
 You first must organize your ships together into groups.  You can access a
 screen which displays all of your groups together, from which you can 
 select the individual group you want to work with.  There are four kinds 
 of groups that you can create - Satellite, Cargo, Combat and Defense. 
 Once you've created the necessary type of group you can add your ships to
 it.  
 
    Reunion gives you a limited number of groups, spread over two pages. 
 One page is dedicated to planetary defense forces, while the other is for 
 all other groups.  As I mentioned before, building defense forces requires
 a LOT of work and patience.  They don't even appear to be required 
 (discussed below).  Yet Reunion makes 50% of the available group slots 
 DEDICATED to defense forces!  You can't put anything else in them!  No one
 would possibly EVER need that many groups of them!  Furthermore, there is 
 apparently NO WAY to disband a group once it's been created.  If all the 
 ships are removed or destroyed, the "group" is sent back to New Earth.  
 The name of the group (which you can't change) sits empty in the slot it
 occupies.  You can't get rid of it.  Fortunately,  Reunion gives you 
 plenty of slots to work with; I didn't even use half of them.  It's still 
 annoying to leave all those empty groups sitting around.
 
    Having grouped your ships together, it's time to hop in the cockpit!
 This gives you a view of the stars, if you're in space, or of the planet
 you're on when you've landed.  It's pretty. It's useless. I would never 
 ever use this screen were it not for the fact that it's the only place 
 where you can command your ships to take off or land.  Every other order 
 can be issued from the starmap.
 
    The starmap is a pretty display of the star system or planetary system
 that you've currently selected.  It looks really similar to the map 
 display in the multistage Psygnosis shoot-em-up Awesome.  At its main 
 level it shows an entire star system, with all known planets shown.  Other
 known star systems can be selected from a menu on the right.  Clicking on 
 a planet zooms in to show the planet, any known moons, and any known 
 fleets of spacecraft in the system.  Most functions concerning ships, such
 as moving them, combat, etc. can be accessed from the menu here.  This is 
 also the only way to access a planetary view of another planet.  If you 
 hit the button in the command center you get only New Earth, nothing else.
 The starmap is probably the most polished of Reunion's features.  It works
 well and allows most functions needed during the game to be executed.  
 It's no more complex than any of the other displays, but this type of 
 display calls for simplicity rather than complexity.
 
    Sending out your ships once they are built is relatively painless.
 Launch them from the cockpit, then tell them where to go.  If you watch
 from the cockpit you can see a nifty starfield.  Once you've reached
 another world you can drop satellites to explore and determine the mineral
 content and inhabitability of the world.  Mineral worlds can have robotic
 mining stations installed, while habitable planets can have new colonies
 erected.  It's even possible to build a mining station before the
 inhabitability report comes in, and then build the colony later.
 
    True to form, Reunion just doesn't go deep enough here.  Mining 
 stations are next to worthless as they can't be upgraded and can store 
 only a tiny amount of ore.  I soon abandoned them in favor of constructing
 colonies, which can still have mines as well as storage centers to hold
 the ore.  While it's possible to make use of the added output of the
 mining stations, it requires a massive effort to collect the ore.  Ship
 after ship must be sent in to pick up the small amount generated because
 if the stores get full, production stops.  It's too much work.

                               @{b}Not Alone@{ub}


    Not long after your first ship is sent out, you'll encounter your first
 alien race. They live within your OWN STAR SYSTEM.  For some reason you
 haven't detected them until now.  Oh, well.  Anyway, they're a nice 
 folk.  They give you all sorts of interesting technology that you wouldn't
 be able to get otherwise.  Your meetings with them take place in a small 
 room where you can ask and answer questions.  This is the only interaction
 (aside from the bar) that you can have with aliens.  The only trade in the
 game is available here.  You can't even contact the aliens, they have to 
 contact you.  If you wanna talk, tough beans.  You can even send a ship 
 laden with useful ore and equipment to an alien world and LAND on it, but 
 to no avail.  You can't trade and they won't even talk to you.  You can 
 even land on a HOSTILE planet, no attempt being made to attack your 
 juicy, undefended cargo ship.
 
    They will, however, destroy your satellites.  Even if the race is
 friendly, normal satellites will be destroyed when deployed.  Only spy
 satellites and spy ships can be deployed over alien worlds.  Not that 
 they're very useful, mind you.  When you drop a satellite over a 
 supposedly densely populated alien world, the images that come back are of
 a BARREN SURFACE!  NO BUILDINGS OR ACTIVITY!  I guess all aliens must live
 underground or something.

                              @{b}Just Fight, OK?@{ub}


    Not all aliens want to be your friends, and of course the only real way
 to deal with them is by blowing the crap out of 'em.  For that you need a
 navy, an army, and weapons to arm the two.  How you group them depends on
 whether the force is to be offensive or defensive.  I got through the game
 with only one defensive force, stationed at New Earth.  The aliens either
 didn't know or didn't care about my fat, juicy, undefended colonies just
 waiting to be invaded. All of their assault attempts were on New Earth.
 Aliens are dumb. 
 
    Therefore you'll probably be building only offensive forces.  These are
 similar to your peacetime groups, except they have slots for both warships
 and ground forces.  The ships are to take out opposing navies and the 
 tanks and jets are for mopping up on the surface. Naturally you have to 
 take out the enemy spacecraft first. (It should be mentioned that you can 
 actually land on enemy planets with a full complement of tanks, troop 
 carriers, jets and warships, without the enemy so much as throwing a 
 pebble at you...Aliens won't fire first around their own planets.) 
 
    Space combat is simple, noninteractive, but cool.  It's probably the
 prettiest part of the game.  After you give the order to attack, a radar
 display showing your ships and the enemy's ships pops up, and the battle
 ensues.  This is kind of like watching the space battles in Macross or 
 Gundam from far away, with little specs of light exchanging little 
 blossoms of fire.  In the lower right corner of the screen a series of 
 animations plays during the battle.  These are reminiscent of the final 
 battle in Return of the Jedi, and look real cool.  They don't actually 
 MEAN anything, mind you, they're just eye candy.  Only the radar gives 
 meaningful information.  It would be nice to be able to issue orders and 
 strategies during the battle, but the only option you have is to retreat. 
 I usually didn't; the animations are so cool that I didn't care if I lost,
 I just watched them until the end.  All in all, the whole affair basically
 amounts to sending out your boys and telling them to "wing it."
 
    Ground Combat is different. Before combat begins you are asked to
 organize you troops into divisions, deciding between concentrated strength
 and firepower or greater flexibility in movement. Combat takes place on a
 single screen of terrain, where you can issue orders to individual 
 divsions.  It all happens so fast that you can't really do much but tell 
 them to go ahead and shoot, and it doesn't pay to have lots of them 
 because you could never issue orders to them all.  Once all the 
 defenders are taken out the planet's yours.... And you get a colony there 
 whether you want it or not.  Invading is real expensive, not because of 
 the cost of warfare, but because you're required to build a whole damn new
 colony every time you win.

                               @{b}Summing Up@{ub}

    I really wanted to like Reunion.  Honest.  It's very pretty, even on
 the ECS version, the music is fantastic (you have two user-selectable
tunes
 to choose from), and the whole concept of a civilization attempting to 
 discover what became of its progenitors is absolutely fantastic.  
 Unfortunately, its flaws are much to great for me to recommend that
 someone plunk down money for it.
 
    For one thing, it's way too linear.  You can't do ANYTHING out of the
 proscribed order.  You discover each star system in a certain order, go to
 war in a certain order, and are at the mercy of events which you aren't
 allowed to change even if you could.  For example, soon after you meet the
 nearby benevolent aliens, they tell you that an enemy race is coming and
 that they need your help.  They give you plans for a simple space fighter
 and ask that you send as many as you can build to help them.  You have 
 enough time to build about THREE before the aliens attack.  If you send 
 them out you're greeted by an armada of over 500 ships (far larger than 
 ANYTHING ELSE in the game!) which neatly destroys your little force, kills
 all your buddies, and generally gives you a bad time.  Once your buddies 
 are dead, the armada disappears as mysteriously as it came.  The force 
 guarding the alien HOME WORLD isn't even a fifth as big!  The whole thing 
 screams plot device.  As an experiment I cheated by editing the data files
 to give me a massive fleet, big enough to take out the alien menace.  I 
 sent it out, and after a long, protracted, battle, managed to defeat the 
 invaders.  No sooner had I done this than I was told of how the friendly 
 aliens' base was destroyed by the armada which I HAD JUST OBLITERATED!  
 This defied all logic and really pissed me off.
 
    But what really kills Reunion is that is just isn't deep enough. It
 shows wonderful potential in its colony building and exploration 
 sequences, but they just don't have enough complexity to make them 
 worthwhile.  Why offer me the ability to lay out my bases when the layout 
 makes no difference?  Why let me have defense forces when I can build only
 equipment at my home base?  Why have trading ships when I can't even 
 trade?  The whole game is an exercise in astonishment giving way to 
 dissapointment.  A lot of talent clearly went into the basic design of 
 this game, but hampered by its linearity, shallow gameplay, and incredibly
 stupid ending, I have to say that it was wasted.

                                REVIEW

    Page Stream 3.0g has been greatly improved over previous versions.
 Many bugs have been fixed.  One of the most useful additions to PS3
 is the new ability to print EPS disk files.  This lets you have an
 industry standard disk to take to print shops.

    The long awaited AGA support is well done.  The ability to use select
 public screens is nice for those with Graphic Boards as well.

    Arexx support is probably PS3's nicest feature.  Built-in arexx
 recording makes it easy to make your own macros.  PS3 also comes with a
 variety of useful macros, including a nice one that creates a font
 list.

    A new feature of PS3 is the better color support, which includes many
 color adjustments to CMYK printing.  Gradient fills are also now
 supported.

    Something of great use is the export feature.  You can export or import
 a block text or graphic.  This feature, which supports many different text
 and graphic formats, makes for a well rounded program.

    Postcript is much better supported than in Page Stream 2.2.  Now, 
 Postscript printing quality is tailored to your printer.  A driver for
 Fargo's Primera color printer is available.  This only works with the
 the dye-sublimation option, however.  You can use the preferences driver
 for wax-transfer.

    BME is short for Bit Map Editor, a useful tool which comes with
 PS3.  It loads in most graphic formats and allows you to edit them using
 different brushes and so on.  It is capable of a few effects, as well as
 cropping and cloning.  This is version 2.0a of BME, and it's also equipped
 with arexx, making it versitile and useful in conjunction with PS3. 

    Page Liner, a text editor also comes with PS3.  This is no ordinary
 editor, however.  It has all the text formatting PS3 does, and you can
 enter text into it very quickly, and then load in the already formatted
 text into PS3.  The current version in PS3 is 2.0c.

                             DOCUMENTATION

    Page Stream 3 comes with a well-written, easy-to-read, large-printed
 manual that covers everything the program does in detail.

    On-Line documentation is also available on Page Stream 3 as a bonus.

                                LIKES


    The most likable part about Page Stream 3 is that it brings the Amiga
 up to industry standards.  It has more and better features then similar
 programs found on PCs and Macs.


                         DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

    Page Stream 3 was released prematurely due to public pressure.  Many
 bugs were present, and some features not working, but most have been
 fixed.  My biggest complaint is that you have to figure out and set the
 screen DPI when using a graphics board.


                   COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    Users of Page Stream 2.2 should seriously consider updating as Page
 Stream 3 has over 1000 new features over 2.2.  With the additional AGA
 and Graphic Board support, this program is the definite winner!


                                  BUGS

    I personally have not found any Bugs in release 3.0g.  Soft Logik is
 very good about releasing patches on their BBS and Aminet to fix bugs and
 update the program, so they have conquered most of them.  However, the
 file from the latest patch has a few known bugs listed.  Some of the 
 bigger ones are:
 
       - You cannot apply colors to text using the Color Palette.
       - The Line/Fill button in the toolbar cannot be used for text
       - You can't copy and paste (or duplicate/transform) text frames.
       - Color separations don't work.

                             VENDOR SUPPORT

    I myself have not used their support number, but I have heard good
 things from people whom have.


                               WARRANTY

    Soft Logik makes no warranties regarding Page Stream 3.0.


                             CONCLUSIONS

    Page Stream 3.0g is an excellent program.  If you need or want a Desk
 Top Publishing program, you should definitely get it, and you now have no
 excuse not to do it on the Amiga!

    On a scale from 1-10, 10 being the Highest, I give it a 10

                       @{i}@{fg shine}Character Analysis: Jim Drew@{ui}@{fg text}


    Jim Drew, President and CEO of Utilities Unlimited International gets a
 mixed review of criticisms from the Amiga community, from the Internet in
 particular.  Jim, as you may know is father of EMPLANT board.  He has
 used online services as a means of "spreading the word" about his upcoming
 products before they are released.

    One of the questions that enter the minds of Amiga owners is whether
 or not he can deliver the products he has promised.  He has created the
 first multitasking Mac emulation on ANY computer, by using the Amiga's
 high tech chipset and OS design.  However, many people still find him to
 be untrustworthy, as he has often announced products without ever
 finishing them.
 
    I will attempt to compare the good items that Jim Drew has brought to
 life with his failed attempts. 

 Jim *DID* do the following:
 ===========================
 Released Emplant, the world's first multitasking Mac emulator (&
 supporting software) 
 Released SYBIL (Mac disk support hardware)
 Released AMIA ( Replacement for SYBIL that could be used with Emplant) 
 Released a free Multi-OS filesystem
 ..and just recently released the e586dx emulation module
 (P*ntium instruction emulation)


 Jim promised people a lot of things at one time or another that have never
 left the UU labs:
 ==========================================================================
 PCMCIA Emplant (for A1200's)
 3DO emulation for CD^32's.
 Atari 400/800 emulator
 Atari ST emulator
 Apple IIe/II+ emulator
 Commodore 64/128 emulators
 SNES emulator
 Genesis emulator
 Free Virtual Memory program that will work with his emulations.

    Which leaves a lot of unreleased products, and a lot of questions to be
 answered about Jim's integrity.   Some people think his outrageous claims
 are comparable to the boy who cried "Wolf!"   It may be that he is
 too enthusiastic for a disgruntled and disbelieving Amiga community to
 accept him in these dark hours of the Commodore buyout.  Some people have
 engaged in name calling, but this does not really hurt Jim's products, and
 is not to the general good of the Amiga community. 

    Jim recently has stopped responding to email on the internet because of
 the criticisms and angst of some disgruntled Amiga owners.  I sincerely
 hope it does not affect his efforts or his development of new products,
 and that the Amiga  doesn't lose yet another developer supporting it.
 As it is, GVP's departure from the Amiga market has left him as one of the
 biggest developers for the Amiga.
 
    I personally believe that Amiga owners should take a WYSIWYG (What You
 See Is What You Get -Josh) to his products.  If you are ambitious, you may
 wish to buy his products and "ride out the storm."  If you are not, it is
 safer to view his products with interest, but to wait until they have been
 tested first.
 
     Caveat Emptor - Let the buyer beware.

                                Don't Bail Out!

    I've noticed much negativity recently, due to the Amiga's situation.
 People are giving up because of the time it has taken to resolve the C=
 buyout.  Many people are alarmed and have every right to be.  I also
 have even felt a little nervous about this situation that we have been
 stuck with.
 
    The Amiga is a great computer.  It is superior to all other PCs on
 the market.  Yes, Commodore is gone, you must accept it.  Two (or more
 -Josh) companies are fighting over Commodore and the Amiga,  so I don't
 see a problem in future support.  The lack of support right now is no
 reason to bail out on the Amiga.  Once everthing is settled, we will
 probably have more support than we had in the past, since the company will
 no longer be run by idiots.

    Now, to  anyone considering jumping ship and buying an PC or Macintosh,
 I suggest that you to go to the store or a friend's house and just really
 use one.  They are not at all comparable to Amigas and you will not want
 to switch.  Macs do not have a command line interface (e.g. DOS -Josh)
 included with them, and PCs have no real GUI to speak of.  Consider that
 before you make a rash decision that you will regret.

    If you must have more support, buy a PC or an Emplant.  The Emplant 
 board runs Macintosh software at a very usable speed.  This is on my 4000
 of course, but I've been told that it also works well on other machines  
 The Emplant is a great alternative.  If you absolutely need a PC, your 
 best bet is to buy a no-name PC as they are dirt cheap.  Just don't
 get rid of your Amiga; you will regret it in the long run. 

    My suggestion to every Amiga user is to give it a little more time.
 You will be glad that you did.  The Commodore bankruptcy will get settled,
 When it is, the Amiga will return to its spot of greatness in the computer
 market and restore the confidence of the developers.

 REVIEW



     Pinball Illusions is the third of Digital Illusions' pinball series 
 (preceded by Pinball Dreams and Pinball Fantasies). One of the features 
 which players have asked for is multiball play, and Illusions is the 
 first of the series to implement it.

     Dreams and Fantasies were played on a scrolling table which followed
 the location of one ball at all times, but multiball might have caused
 problems for some players if this technique had been used again.  The
 programmers decided to use an interlaced screen mode which doubled the
 amount of the table displayed.  The choice of colors for each table
 apparently reduces flicker, which is a problem on other interlaced games.
 Although the balls and targets are smaller, they are still recognizable
 and everything can be seen at once.  But if the new screen mode is too
 hard to play on,  the traditional mode can be selected instead.

     Another new feature is the addition of play modes.  All modern pinball
 games now have several special scoring modes in which huge bonuses can be 
 earned if certain targets are hit in order and within a time limit.  I 
 count 29 special scoring modes, not including random-bonus targets or 
 normal multiball bonuses, spread across 3 tables.  The variety of play 
 options greatly enhances the life of the game, since a player can try to 
 get huge scores many different ways.

     Yet another modern enhancement is the (simulated) addition of a 
 dot-matrix video screen on the table.  This really helps a player during 
 the scoring modes by giving directions concerning the necessary targets. 
 Sometimes it shows humorous animations when certain targets are hit.  It 
 also allows the playing of a "video mode."  In the Shootout video mode, 
 the flipper buttons guide a gunsight across the video screen.  When the 
 gunsight rests on a target, a gun fires and the player gets points.  The 
 video screen adds a little more variety to the game.

     All of the new features are great bells and whistles, but the tables
themselves must be well-designed or they quickly become boring. Thankfully,
they are...

     The first table, Law 'n' Justice, has a large open space in the middle
 so the ball can travel, yet it has several ramps, bumpers, and drop 
 targets along the perimeter so that the ball can travel across the open 
 area to each target and score combination bonuses. 

     The second table, Babewatch, is somewhat crowded at the top of the 
 table, but there are two table levels so there are still many targets to 
 aim for beneath the second level.  This table has the least play modes, 
 but each mode has the potential for the most points. The table is also 
 very humorous, especially during the fifth possible mode called "Babe 
 Hunt" which has hilarious theme music.

     The third table, Extreme Sports, is a good table, but it has its 
 problems. The board is crowded with walls and ramps, and the 
 triangle-shaped bumpers near the flippers have a tendency to bounce the 
 ball straight down the left outhole.  Two walls, one above the flippers 
 and another underneath the left ramp, tend to deflect the ball straight 
 down the middle of the table and between the flippers.  Aside from these 
 problems, the table is exciting because many of the scoring modes have 
 short time limits and a player struggles to make all the large-scoring
 shots.

     There are a couple of bugs in the game which hurt the gameplay. 
 Sometimes the program loses the location of a ball when it goes into a
 drop  target or down the drain.  When this happens, the game can't go on
 because there's no ball on the table.  This means that the current game
 must be aborted, which is really annoying when one has a score of
 1,546,850 and is still on ball 1!

     The bug is more annoying if a TILT is called, because the 'ESC' key 
 doesn't abort a game during a TILT. This means that the player must 
 reboot the computer.

     I also found a bug recently which requires a restart butt has only
 happened once to me.  On Extreme Sports, the ball went down the left
 outhole and got stuck.  I could not move it no matter how much I 'hit' the
 table.  Another minor bug cuts out sound if the ball is relaunched right
 after a TILT.  The sound is usually reactivated after a while, though.

     I'm also a bit disappointed with the graphics.  I've already
 complimented the almost flicker-free interlace mode, but I don't like the
 lifelessness of the table gadgets.  The ball doesn't spin, the mushroom
 bumpers don't visibly 'kick,' rollovers and switches don't look like
 they're triggered.

     Pinball Illusions is a great game.  It looks pretty good, sounds
 great, and contains a variety of different scoring opportunities.  The
 price (in the US) is pretty good, too; it has a MSRP of $39.95 for the
 NTSC version so stores will probably have it for $5-$10 less.  I bought
 the imported PAL version for $44.95.  I think £19.99 is a good price in
 the UK, and Illusions sells for that in several magazine ads.  If a
 pinball fan compares the price of Pinball Illusions to the price of
 playing real pinball games, she/he will realize that a lot of money can be
 saved by playing Pinball Illusions instead.

                                  Part 2
                              
 
 
     Welcome to the second installment of this series on the EMPLANT board
 and software system.  Before I get started on the article though, I
 have a correction from last month's article.  I stated that the plain
 vanilla A2500 had a 68000 cpu.  This was correctly identified by a
 reader as being a 68030 cpu.  Sorry for the error, no slam intended
 against the A2500.
 
     Last month we left the EMPLANT with a fair description of all the
 peripheral things required to install the board and get it working.
 This month, let's discuss installing the EMPLANT and its software.
 
                         @{i}@{u}Installing the ROMs@{ui}@{uu}
 
     Before we open the case of the computer, we should install the ROMs
 on the EMPLANT board.  This is only necessary if you do not have a
 real live Mac handy.  If you do, there's no reason to tear it apart
 and remove the ROMs.  They can be dumped in place very nicely in the
 Mac.  More about that in a minute.  DO NOT TRY TO INSTALL THE ROMS
 WITH THE BOARD ALREADY IN THE COMPUTER!  If you do, you run a very
 real risk of damaging the board and/or your computer.  If you have to
 press hard enough to install the chips with the board already
 installed, you will likely break or crack the board as well as damage
 the computer's internals.
 
     Begin with your EMPLANT lying flat on a hard flat surface with the
 gold edge connector toward you.  A helpful suggestion is to place a
 towel or a thickness of newspaper under the EMPLANT to prevent
 scratching the table surface from the back of the board.
 
                              @{i}@{u}SIMMs@{ui}@{uu}
 
     If you have the ROMs on a SIMM setup, they are installed in the SIMM
 socket located at the top, left edge of the board.  There is only one
 SIMM socket on the board so it should not be too hard to find.  It is
 the long thin socket labeled "ROM SIMM SOCKET".
 
     Notice that there are also two jumpers labeled JP 1 and JP 2.  JP 1
 controls the address lines to the socket.  The ROM dump program
 requires that this jumper be set to the right side.  JP 2 on the other
 hand is set to the leftmost position.  These will probably be already set
 correctly from the "factory".  If not, use a set of needle nose pliers
 or your fingers to move the jumpers.  Be careful not to bend the pins!
 
     Install the SIMM ROM in the socket and click it into place.  The
 components on the SIMM ROM should be facing you (the gold edge
 connector) once installed.
 
                                   @{i}@{u}DIPs@{ui}@{uu}
 
     If you have the ROMs as individual chips (called DIP ROMs or DIPs),
 they are installed in the "Socket 1", "Socket 2", "Socket 3", and
 "Socket 4" chip sockets.  Note that two different types of DIP
 (socketed) ROMs can be had in the 256K configuration.  They can be
 either 28 pin or 32 pin ROMs.  The 28 pin DIP ROMs are installed such
 that the empty pin holes are on the Pin 1 end of the socket.  The Pin
 1 end of the chip is indicated by the notch on the end of the chip
 and/or socket.  The 32 pin DIP ROMs, of course, cover all the holes in
 the socket.
 
     Insert each of the four DIP ROMs into their respective sockets by the
 following procedure:
 
 1.      Make sure that all of the pins line up with the pin holes in
         the socket and that the notch in the chip is oriented towards the
         same end as the notch in the socket.
 2.      Gently press down on the chip until you feel the DIP pins
         beginning to enter the holes in the sockets.
 3.      Check to make sure that all of the pins and holes are properly
         aligned.
 4.      Using equal force on each end of the chip, press it until it
         is fully and firmly  in- stalled in the Socket.
 5.      Check the DIP ROMs as well as you can to make sure that each pin
         entered the corresponding hole in the socket.
 
     If you are pressing fairly hard on the chip and it still isn't
 entering the socket, you more than likely have the chip pin misaligned
 slightly.  I usually find that installing a chip requires me to align
 the pins slightly.  Use a flat hard surface (like the unshielded table
 top) to lay the chip on its side and gently press the pins inward using
 the table surface to evenly move the pins.  Try not to move the pins more
 than a millimeter or so on each side.  It doesn't take much!  The secret
 is to keep the pins even, hence the hard table top to press the pins
 against.
 
     It really doesn't matter which chip goes in which socket.  The only
 thing to make sure of is that the serial numbers are sequential on the
 chips that you use.  For example, the chip serial numbers should be in
 sequence such as ending with 105, 106, 107, and 108.  If you have
 chips with serial numbers ending with 105, 107, 108, and 109 for
 example, they will not work.

     After the SIMM or DIP installation, the board is now ready to
 install.  Open the case of your computer as follows:
 
 1.      Locate the several small screws that hold the computer lid on.
 2.      Remove the screws and place them in a protected place.  (I
         like to stick them to a piece of masking tape to keep from losing
         them).
 3.      Carefully remove the lid.
 4.      Locate the slot (see the books that came with your Amiga to
         help with this) that you wish to use and remove the metal plate at
         the back of the computer that matches that slot. 
 5.      Align the card's edge connector to the connector slot (the long,
         thin  black plastic thingy that matches the edge connector in
         length).  The EMPLANT should be aligned so that the edge connector

         is away from you if you are sitting directly in front of the
         computer and the metal plate on the end is aligned with the back 
         of the computer.
  6.     Press the EMPLANT into the empty slot selected by pressing the
         top of the card firmly.
  7.     Using the screw that came with the metal plate in the back of
         the computer, fasten the EMPLANT's metal plate to the back of 
         the computer frame.
  8.     Reassemble the computer lid to the frame, but leave the screws out
         for now. 
  9.     Fire up the computer and ensure that the startup proceeds
         without incident.
 
                         @{i}@{u}Installing the Software@{ui}@{uu}
 
     Select the directory where you will install the software.  On my hard
 drive, I have a partition called "Apps:" where I keep all of my
 applications.  In the Apps: partition, I have a Directory labeled
 "Emulations"; under Emulations I have "Emplant".  Usually the setup script
 will establish the directory structure for you, as is the case with the
 EMPLANT install script, but I'm hard headed.  I like to create my own
 structures.
 
    MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR PROGRAM DISK.  Some people don't do this and it
 causes them much heartache when they destroy their program disk.  Others
 don't like having multiple copies of the same software in their inventory
 Get over it, diskettes are cheap.  At the very least, use a diskette to
 make a copy and then use it for something else.  Make sure that you change
 the name of the backup diskette to match that of its source.  This will be
 important with the installer.
 
     MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR PARTITIONS.  This includes the System and 
 whatever you have as the applications drive/partition where the
 application will actually be stored.  Anytime you are using an installer
 that makes as many profound changes as EMPLANT does to your system
 libraries, devices, etc. it is foolhardy to do so without a backup of the
 partition/drive.  The EMPLANT uses the standard Amiga loader, but you have
 been warned!
 
     The software will have to be decompressed.  The decompression can be
 done to either a floppy or to the RAM: device.  If a floppy is to be
 used, format the floppy with the name Mac2.  Decompress the program
 diskette to Mac2.  If you elect to decompress to RAM.  Decompress the
 archive to the RAM: device and then assign Mac2 to RAM:
 
     Once this is completed, open the diskette and read the "readme.first!"
 and "changes.txt" files.  These usually contain any late breaking news
 and give instructions on installing the software.  Actually, to install 
 you just double click on the HardDisk_Installer icon on your decompressed
 diskette (Mac2:).  You will of course, have to answer questions about your
 machine and the hard disk structure.  If you are nervous, select the
 intermediate user switch and do a pretend installation.  Actually this is
 a good idea for the first time installer regardless of skill level.
 
     Several things are worth mentioning here.  No matter how educated you
 are about Amiga structures, files, etc.,  you will want to run the
 installer anyway.  One of the things that it does is to create a file
 or two using your machine's system as a source reference.  This means
 that the EMPLANT software custom tailors itself for your machine.
 Later on, you can obtain the LT version for upgrades and just copy the
 libs, devices, etc.,  where they belong.  
 
     Another thing worth mentioning is how the Startup-Sequence (S-S) and
 user-startup (u-s) files are changed.  The program adds two things to
 the S-S.  The very first line in the S-S must be "execute >NIL:
 s:SetupEMPLANT".  Later with other software additions, ensure that
 this line is always first in the file.  Also, another line "RsrvMemXX
 >NIL: will be added to S-S.  The position of this statement is not
 critical like the previous "execute . . ." statement.  The XX in
 RsrvMemXX refers to the version of the RsrvMem that is current.
 
     In the u-s file, the very last line in the u-s must be "execute>NIL:
 s:AssignEMPLANT".  This line may be frequently moved from its position
 as the last line in the u-s file when other software is added.  Always
 check this after installation of other software and move the line to
 last if necessary.
 
                          @{i}@{u}Creating a ROM Image@{ui}@{uu}
 
     First off, don't steal the ROM.  If you own a Mac, it is perfectly
 legal to copy the ROM and use it as long as both machines (Mac and EMPLANT
 are not being run at the same time. If you just purchase a set of ROMs and
 download them as I am going to describe, and you keep the ROMs on the
 shelf, it is legal to use them in this manner.  If you purchase a set of
 ROMs, download them, sell the ROMs and continue to use the EMPLANT, that
 is piracy.
 
     Now, having that out of the way, REMEMBER THAT ONLY 256K ROMS FROM A
 SE/30, IIc, IIcx, or a IIx WILL WORK WITH EMPLANT.  Sorry about the
 yelling, but the most common problem for new users that I see reading
 the nets is the use of the wrong ROMs.  Other Mac emulators use 128K
 ROMs; not the EMPLANT.  Your Mac LC etc, Quadra, etc. will have 512 or
 1024K ROMs.  None of these ROMs will do.  They must be 256K ROMs.
 
     There are three version of the 256K ROMs available for the Mac.  They
 are versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.  The two earlier versions do not
 include High Density drive support and are usually much cheaper.  The
 version of 256K ROMs that you have matters not one whit to the
 EMPLANT.  It has its own custom routines for drive support anyway.
 Any of the three versions will work so go with the cheapest one that
 you can find.  ROMs are available on the Internet, through Mac dealers
 (yeah right!), and through several computer mail order houses.
 
     Obtaining a ROM image is relatively difficult because there are no
 instructions on how to do it!  We will deal with two cases.  First is
 if you own a Mac.  In the EMPLANT archive there is a program called
 "ROMINFO".  This is the file to dump a ROM in a Mac computer.  Getting
 it to the Mac can be rather tricky.  (Ok, ok, it was only tricky for
 me!) The file cannot just be copied to a diskette (even a Mac formatted
 one) and placed on the Mac.  The copy must be a binary copy.  If you 
 attempt to copy the file to an IBM formatted diskette and move it to the
 to the Mac, it will not work.
 
     The reason for this is that Mac drives have two files for each visible
 file.  One file is called the data fork (yes, fork) and the other is
 called is called the resource fork.  Only a binary copy from the Amiga
 will move both forks.  Copying to a Mac formatted diskette without
 performing a binary copy will only give the data fork.  Similarly, moving
 the file to an IBM diskette will only copy the data fork.
  There are two ways to get the ROMINFO to the Mac:

 1)      Hook up a modem from the Amiga to the Mac and transfer the
         file as a binary file. 
 2)      Use a utility program such as CrossMac to perform a binary
         copy.
 
     EMPLANT does not currently provide a means of writing Mac diskettes
 other than within the emulator.  I chose the second of my two methods
 above because I wanted software to transfer Mac stuff outside the
 emulator anyway, and so it wasn't a problem to purchase Cross-Mac.
 
     Once the ROMINFO file is transferred to a Mac-formatted diskette, it
 is a simple matter of double clicking the icon on a real Mac and
 you're off.
 
     For those of us who put the ROMs on the EMPLANT board, run the
 applicable program, either Dump256KSIMM or Dump256KDIPs.  These are found
 in your first subdrawer level on the hard drive after the software
 install.  Once you have dumped the ROMs, remove the EMPLANT card from
 your machine and remove the SIMM/DIPs that you installed previously.
 Reinstall the EMPLANT card as indicated above.
 
     Any of the methods of obtaining the ROM dump will result in a file
 that should be copied to the ROM_Images drawer.  It is located in the
 Mac drawer.
 
     I guess that's all the space I have for this issue.  Next issue,
 we'll discuss setting prefs on the emulator and hard drives.  Until
 then, happy MACing!

    Tom handed the tablet back to John Delacroix after staring closely at
 the plainly visible symbol on it.
    Again Tom remarked, "I can't believe how that looks like the Commodore
logo and nothing else even faintly looks like our alphabet!"
    Heading to the laptop, John replied, "We're right on the edge of
 something, aren't we?  If the symbols are similar, then we should have a
 clue soon."
    Tom moved to sit out the wait on the rock ledge, turning his head
 slightly to hear faint scuffles of an insect in the tunnel.
    Shortly, his curiosity vanished as several robed men quickly, but
 quietly, moved into the chamber.  They were holding large, sharp knives
 that looked very unhealthy to Tom.
    A man stepped forward and said, in clear English, "Please do not make
 sudden moves and put your hands out."
    They did as they were told.  Tom was not an expert in nationalities,
 but the men all looked native to this region.
    The man spoke again, "Do you think we are fools that you could come
 and take away our treasures?  I myself have studied at your Yale
 University.  I learned much more than just what nice locks they make.  But
 enough.  Tie them up." Four big men obeyed.
    The leader continued, "And in gratitude for your efforts for us, we are
 leaving you your lives."
    He motioned to a man, "Take the tablets and their machine."
    A scowl replied, "But the laptop's no good, it's five months old! DOS
 27.21 is out now and you need 40 meg ram."
    The leader glared angily, "Did we train you for nothing? We need the
 data in the machine," and pushed him towards it.
    As they left the chamber, with John and Tom well tied, the leader
 turned and bowed slightly, "It has been a nice transaction."
    Struggling against the ropes was futile.  "What do we do now?" Tom
 moaned out.
    As if in response, a small shape moved out of the shadows.  He was a
 young boy shabbily dressed in clothes of the region, no more than 14, Tom
 thought.
    "Can I help?" he asked.
    "Yes! Untie us, " John answered. "We have to catch those men."
    The boy, an orphan named Armand, said that was impossible.  The men had
 camels and were riding into the desert.  They would skirt the far end of
 the rock cliffs to reach an oasis on the other side by nightfall.
 Besides, the leader was Razsca, a man of bad reputation.
    "But," he said, "I know an opening in the cliffs.  It is big enough for
 me and I will be there by dark.  Will it be worth fifty dollar American to
 get your things?"
    "Yes, at least," John said after a thoughtful pause, "But will you be
safe?"
    "Not a problem," Armand replied.  "I will be less than a shadow to
 them.  Wait here for me," he said slipping away.
    Tom looked questioningly at John.  "I sure hope you know what you're
 doing."
    About five hours later, as night fell, the boy left a cleft on the
 other side of the cliffs and hid among the plants of the oasis.
    Razsca and the men rode up and dismounted.  He turned to one, "You have
 the things?"
  "Yes, they are hidden with the meat," was the grunted reply.
  After drinking, the men moved to the other side to camp and Armand stole
 in among the camels. He lifted the sack and ran back the way he had come.
 But, in his haste to get up the incline to the cleft, the boy's foot
 caught on a rock and he fell flat, the bag sailing over rocks to the sand
 a few feet below. That sudden noise dislodged the largest bird he had ever
 seen.  At first he thought it was a vulture, but it had the long legs of a
 secretary bird.  Whatever it was circled tightly, scented the dried meat,
 caught up the bag, and was quickly away along the cliffs.
    In shock, Armand watched his fifty dollar hope and the hidden secret of
 the tablets slowly become a speck on the horizon and then disappear.


                                 to be continued...

     It hit me all of a sudden.  There I was, walking down the cafeteria in
 my school, when I saw it.  A laptop.  I was mesmerized.  All my thoughts
 turned to it.  It was like the equivelant of a woman's biological clock
 telling her to have a baby.  All of a sudden I couldn't live without a
 laptop.  


     I thought about this urge for a while.  I honestly couldn't think of
 many things I'd use a laptop for.  The only ones that immediately came to
 mind were for typing notes in class, using the Internet while I was not
 occupied with other classwork, and writing stories as I was in the car.
 In reality none of these reasons was good enough to buy a laptop instead
 of a new A1200 with a 68030 accelerator when they finally come out.  And
 yet it didn't seem to matter.


     "Oh, what can I do!" I thought.  I wanted a laptop, but I didn't at
 all  want to buy a hideous PC, and I didn't like the idea of a Mac too
 much either.  I had heard of the hack to put your Amiga into a laptop, but
 I didn't trust hacks too much, and besides, I didn't have a spare Amiga to
 use.  


     For days I pondered my problem, until I came upon the Amiga World Wide
 Web Page.  I read the three articles by ex-C= employees, and read their
 talk of this technology and that technology, and I realized like never
 before how badly C= had screwed the Amiga.  Not just a lot.  No, Commodore
 did about as much to kill the Amiga as humanly possible.  If you ever read
 these articles you'll be sick to your stomach, and vow to kill Medhi Ali
 and Irving Gould.  And yet, these articles gave me new hope.  How, you
 say?  How could such depressing articles give me hope?  They did, because
 I saw how incredible the Amiga technology still is.  I saw that as soon as
 the buyout is over we can have machines that we'd never even DREAMED of
 before.  I saw machines that would blow every PC user's mind.  But more
 than that, I saw technology that could easily make a laptop Amiga, which
 could run all my favorite word pros, games, comm programs, and much, much
 more.


     And I saw that the new company that will own the Amiga can't be as bad
 as C=.  I saw that there was no way that they could make such hideous
 decisions.  I knew that they'd eventually make a laptop Amiga.


     And I saw myself calling my dealer to pre-order one as soon as they
 were announced...

PRODUCT NAME

        Liquidation of Commodore International, Ltd.


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        A product that everyone feared would eventually come, and it 
 finally came upon us mercilessly.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:   Bahamian Courts, with some help from various legal eagles.


LIST PRICE

        Anywhere from $19 million to about $100 million (US), depending on
 whom you ask.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                Strong nerves.

        SOFTWARE

                Lots of patience.


COPY PROTECTION

        This product is protected from successfully operating by a couple 
 of fools named Mehdi Ali and Irving Gould.  I would rate this copy
 protection as unacceptable.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        This product has been in extensive testing on over 4 million Amigas
 worldwide.  Many users were so exhausted from testing that they just
 decided to sell their machine and migrate to a different platform.


INSTALLATION

        I never installed this on my system, honest. It just somehow made
 its way there.  I suppose you could describe its installation as simple 
 as, say, a computer virus.


REVIEW

        Well, what can I say.  For at least a year before it actually
 happened, I anticipated this product's hitting the Amiga market.  During
 this time, I almost began regarding it as another one of those vaporware
 products that we Amiga users have become so accustomed to.

        When the liquidation finally hit the market, I must say that I was
 quite disappointed.  The whole thing was full of bugs, and hardly ran at
 all. In fact, now, about 9 revisions and updates later, it still doesn't
 seem to deliver what was originally promised, which of course was the
 possibility of a capable company manufacturing and marketing the Amiga
 line of personal computers.

        Though the developers of this product still seem relatively
 enthusiastic about its possibilities, I am beginning to seriously doubt
 the liquidation's viability in the current Amiga market.  In fact, I would
 go as far as suggesting that the market might have been better off without
 such a product being available in the first place.


DOCUMENTATION

        Documentation is extremely poor.  If it weren't for a few good
 supplements, such as Amiga Report, there wouldn't be any documentation at
 all.  (Kudos to the editors.)

LIKES

        I can't say that I like anything about this product.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

        I dislike the lengthy, seemingly endless proceedings that never
 seem to end, and that every time there seems to be the proverbial light at
 the end of the tunnel, it just turns out to be an oncoming locomotive.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        Not much to compare this thing to; but if you're interested, go to
your local library and look up "Pan American Airlines."  They were also a
once-great company that didn't quite make it.


BUGS

        Full of bugs.  Simply doesn't work.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        None.


WARRANTY

        None - expressed nor implied.


CONCLUSIONS

        I would not recommend this liquidation to anyone.  It doesn't
 perform as promised, doesn't even work, and it costs too much.  It also
 causes many of your fellow Amiga owners leave you for little-endian
 pastures.  Stay away!

Microbotics SX1 expansion features parallel, serial, floppy,  IDE and
through ports, with room for 8Meg of RAM.  Available for  199.99 quid. Indi
(01543) 419999. A keyboard is 44.99 and a floppy drive 48.99.  

Multimedia Machine have released an SX1 pack including A CDTV floppy drive
and keyboard, they're selling it for 299 UKP.  Also included are four PD
CD's crammed with stuff, not a bad deal really.

They have their own expansion, ARCHIE,  which will feature a CDTV k/b,
floppy and a parallel interface, for 200 UKP.  Depends what you want really,
they can be reached on (01204) 387410.

If Commodore pulls through, it's own expansion which sits underneath the
CD32 will be released in Spring, with the same functionality as the SX1, but
including the keyboard and floppy drive (and Amiga ones too) for the same
199 UKP price tag.

A professional rack mount expansion is available, but at 400 quid is a
little bit of overkill.  Rumours state that a small planetary system is run
by one of these beasts.  They have plans for a desktop unit, as yet
unconfimed, they're waiting for CBM's future to emerge.

Competition Pro have released a replacement joypad for 19.99 UKP.   It has
all the buttons colour coded, separate auto-fires for all  buttons, and
looks a damn sight nicer to use.  Get one!! LATEST - available for 14.99
from most gaming retail outlets.

 Hello,
 
    I just read your first issue of AmigaLink and I like it.  You are
 doing somethings that AmigaReport should have tried long ago.  Back that
 up?  Well... Coder's Clinic, Paint Tutorial, and Emplant. This should give
 me away as one of those 'how to do it' people, who first turns to the
 "hints and tips" articles in mags.
    I'd really like to see more PD software reviews- all types.  I really
 don't buy Amiga software at stores (even if I still could) because of all
 the good shareware and giftware titles available.  Here's some examples of
 stuff I use now vice the store bought software:

 GED             CED
 REORG           guess a couple titles like QBTools could go here
 DISKSALV        well same as above
 TERM 4.3        tried NComm and JrComm... tried only
 RO .91          This is like Dopus... many updates but is coming along
                 quickly.
 MRBackup        QuarterBack
 VMM             Gigamem
 AmiTCP          ????

     Guess I could go on for awhile.  I'd like to see more on this Emplant
 because I'm thinking of getting one.  Hey, about NETBSD... it's a new life
 for my old Amiga, even if UNIX is a pain to learn.  How about using old C=
 Bridge- Boards?  I have a A2386-25 in my 2000 running DOS 6.22 and
 Windows.  I have a SVGA 1meg card, I/O card (128meg IDE, Floppy, gameport,
 serial mouse), and Reveal Sound card w/CDROM inside.  Too slow?  Nope,
 just got the Cryix upgrade Cx486SRx2-25/50 so the A2386 is a 486SX.
 Lastly, (glad?) a indepth look at video cards for the Amiga... I want to
 use it with NETBSD and X-Windows.
    Well, that's all my 'I wants'. Wish you all the luck with AL.  Hey I
 have an Amiga and an IBM... but I only use the IBM for games!
 
 Michael Greene <michael.greene@exchange.exchange.com>

     Your point on PD/Shareware software is very true.  I have been amazed
in the few months that I've been on the Internet by the amount and quality
of the Amiga PD software on Aminet.  Because of such, I have made an
announcement in this issue as to the fact that Amiga Link is now looking for
a PD editor, to review and write about PD every moth for the magazine.   
     As for writing about emulation, we will write about the Emplant,
because many are interested in that, but we probably not write too much on
emulation, as the audience for that is small.  We'll see what other readers
say about this.

 Dear Ed,
 
          Here are a couple of suggestions that could help to improve your
 magazine:

 1) As the Internet is one of the worlds largest computer networks and is
 used by millions of people, you could start a section up on that. Not just

 concentrating on the internet but also e-mail facilities as well.
 Magazines available from shops are mainly PC and MAC orientated and don`t
 do the amiga justice.
 
 2) Break your new product section up a little more, one large block of
 text is hard on the eyes and puts you off reading it, headings and
 paragraphs would be easier to read and would be better if you were
 searching for a particular product.  
     I have a small problem:  I have e-mail facilities, going through pipex
 but no internet access.  On my e-mail, all I can do is send a letter with
 a subject title and a body of text.  Nothing else. I want to subscribe to
 discussion groups from my e-mail terminal but don`t know quite how to go
 about it.  Sorry if its a bit vague but I don`t know that much about
 e-mail.
    I`d just like to say that your first magazine is a tribute to you and I
 hope to see it grow even bigger as the readers contribute their views too.
 
                                         Matt Whiteley
                                W.J.WHITELEY@UK03.wins.icl.co.uk

     Some article about the Internet is a good idea.  We will definitely
consider that for the future.  As for the products listing, we may go with
your suggestion.  On the other hand, writing it in the way we did in issue
#1 allowed for more "anaylzation."   
     OK, the Amiga Link letter's column is NOT for techinical questions, but
... You don't use an e-mail program to view newsgroups, you use a newsgroup
viewing program like rtin.

    In using our Amigas and making Amiga Link, we have come across 
 some products and services that we believe exemplary.  These products have
 all received the much desired Amiga Link @{"Chicken Seal of Quality" system "m csq"}
 They are as follows:    
  
 @{b}@{u}Heddley@{ub}@{uu}:  This is a program to make Amiga Guide documents (such as the one
 you are reading write now), and it is incredible!  Not only is it very 
 easy to use, but it also cuts the time needed to make an Amiga Guide doc
 by a factor of 8, and has many great features!  It's so good that
 we use Heddley here at Amiga Link!  You can find Heddley v1.1 on Aminet.
 The author is Edd Dumbill.
 
 @{b}@{u}Page Stream 3.0g@{ub}@{uu}:  Version 3 of this product was released early because of
 pressure, and as a result is was very buggy.  However, Soft Logik has been
 very good about trying to fix the bugs and about spreading the new
 releases around.  Page Stream 3.0g is not perfect, but it's pretty damn
 close!  This product really brings the Amiga DTP up to industry standards,
 and we reccomend it to anyone interested in doing DTP on the Amiga, or any
 computer!

     Many people think that they could never write for Amiga Link.  They
 think that their writing is not good enough, or that they don't know
 enough about a subject.  My advice is to ignore these feelings.  Most of
 the people who write for Amiga Link used to feel teh same way.  While
 chatting with them, they'd tell me an in-depth analysis or review of
 something, and then, when I saked them to put it into writing, they said
 "But I don't know enough about it!"  I twisted their arms and look where
 they are today!

 March 25, 1995 The Sam Report

     I had a nice chat with Alex Amor of CEI today.  He is aware that I
 report for Genie so this is cleared for release.

     The auction will begin April 20th in New York and will last about a
 week.  It now appears clear that the remaining interested parties
 are pursuing separate, non-conflicting, parts of the overall package
 (Commodore name, set-top technology, Amiga manufacture, etc.).  It seems
 there is a pre-auction agreement (or at least an understanding) among the
 parties that whoever wins will gladly provide the others with the pieces
 they want.  Only CEI plans to manufacture Amigas.

     Once again, Alex mentioned the caveat that "somebody could come out of
 the woodwork and surprise us all" but he seemed less concerned about this
 than previously.  He mentioned having an excellent information network
 that keeps an eye out for entities that might be lurking in the shadows
 ready to make a last-minute grab.  Those sources indicate no lurkers at
 present.

     The Gould/Ali matter is not a complication at all in the sale process.
 The creditors will go after them in a totally separate action that in no
 way affects the sale at auction.

     He had no comment on the report that IBM was lined up as the contract
 manufacturer (said he couldn't discuss that).  He referred to contracts
 for components that are valid and would be rescinded only if CEI doesn't
 prevail.

     He confirmed my earlier report that talks have been held with Tandy
 (the owners of the huge Computer City and Radio Shack chains in the USA
 --over 6500 stores!-- Josh) and could develop into a distribution reality.

     Again, initial production calls for A4000Ts and A1200s.  The latter
 will be getting a larger case for more internal expansion, but that might
 not happen immediately.

     Alex, in shorts and sneakers, went back to attending to store
 customers on a busy Saturday morning.  As always, he appeared full of
 optimism.  "By the 27th it will all be over!".

     This has been the Sam Report from Miami for GEnie and Amiga Link.

  PRODUCT NAME

   Emplant e586 emulation module

  BRIEF DESCRIPTION

   The long-awaited 586DX emulator software for the Emplant card.

  AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

   Name:  Utilities Unlimited International. Inc.

   Address:  790 N. Lake Havasu Avenue #16
             Lake Havasu City, AZ  86403
             USA

  COPY PROTECTION

   Software updates are freely distributed.  However, you MUST PURCHASE
   the 586DX module.  A hardware upgrade to the Emplant card (a chip
   which you must replace on your card) is included with the module.


  MACHINE USED FOR TESTING


   Amiga 4000 WB 3.1

   40Mhz 'o4o Warp Engine
   
   Picasso II, Video Toaster
  
   2MB Chip 16MB Fast

   DEC 1 Gigabyte SCSI-II hard disk


  REVIEW

     The Emplant e586DX upgrade is quite possibly one of the most sought
 after "Holy Grails" in Amiga history.  For over a year it's feasibility
 and the probability that it might someday actually exist was battled over
 (sometimes, rather violently) in comp.sys.amiga.emulations.  Supporters
 of Jim Drew (the creator of the Emplant) and disbelievers (who were quite
 vociferous) formed factions in c.s.a.e. and battled on a day-to-day basis
 for months and months.  It would seem the e586 ranks right up there with
 the Video Toaster before its release and, of course, the Mac emulation
 before its release.

     With the inception of the e586 software, users were promised the
 ability to truly run multiple operating systems on the same computer at
 the same time without any additional expensive hardware.  The e586
 promised to be many times faster and more compatible than any other
 software emulation on any other platform.  It was a dream come TRUE for
 Amiga users - we could keep our Amigas, yet still be able to run all of
 the popular software previously available only to users of other operating
 systems.

     In a nutshell, here is what you should expect from e586 version 1.1:

  -You must obtain a BIOS.  The BIOS I (successfully) used was the s82.bios

  -The emulation recognized and formatted a partition on my SCSI-II Amiga
   drive.

  -MS-DOS installed with no problem.

  -Windows will not work.  Don't waste your time trying at this point.
   After manually installing windows (as the install crashes on the second
   disk), Windows will attempt to run.  All you will see is a nasty yellow
   Windows startup screen made of pixelated vertical bands.  The words
   "Microsoft Windows" are almost not readable.  The emulation will then
   lock.

  -Benchmarking programs are meaningless when run on the emulation.


     My opinion?  The emulation feels fast.  If I had to make a guess as to
 the equivalent machine I was running on, I'd say it was a 33Mhz 386sx.
 This is based solely from my (rather extensive) experience with PCs. I
 think the emulation has potential.  However, at this point it is nothing
 more than a really neat toy.  Without the ability to run Windows or any
 other application which opens up a graphics screen, it is at this point
 fairly useless.

  Here is a list of things which I have tried:

   Program            Does it work?                   Comments

  MS-DOS 6.22             Yes                  Feels nice and responsive
  Windows                 No                   Locks on Startup
  DOOM                    No                   Locks on Startup
  WordPerfect             Yes                  Can not preview-print
  Wolfenstine 3D          No                   Locks on Startup
  AutoCad X               No                   Locks when displaying model

     Here are some comments Jim Drew (creator of the Emplant) included with
  the e586DX emulation...

          The PC emulation was first started after the first version of
     EMPLANT's MAC emulation was released.  Due to numerous machine
     incompatibilities with the MAC emulation, a large portion of our
     programming time was dedicated to iron out the problems.  Several
     months later, we again resumed work with the PC emulation.  Nearly a
     year later (and dozens of updates to the MAC emulation), the first
     actual test was done.  Egads, was it slow.
         It worked, and it was faster than anything else available, but
     it was really not that usable... good experience.  In late August of
     1994, we started from scratch, now having a good understanding of how
     the PC  architecture worked.
         Speed galore... beating a real 66Mhz DX2 in quite a few tests
     (with  40Mhz 68040 processors) made our day since we knew that there
     is always room for improvements.  After playing with some 3rd party
     EMM386 clone programs, we noticed some interesting problems with the
     MMU setup.      
         The problems turned out to be so severe that we were forced to
     start from scratch again.  Now, a few days later, it is amazing to see
     how fast coding goes compared to the 'learning curve' we had to start
     with.  Our first attempt took more than year; our second attempt took
     6 months; and our third attempt has been 6 days so far, and it is
     nearly ready for testing.
          Our new code is about 1/4 the size and could be as much as twice
     as fast.  A lot of this new code is due to the PowerPC version of this
     emulation.  Since this product is being developed for both the Amiga
     and PowerMAC platforms, changes in one machine's code can often lead
     to optimizations in another machine's code... such as we have found
     when working with PowerPC assembly and 68K assembly.
           The executable code released on this disk is more than 1.75 megs
     (Yes, it is compressed).  The source code totals more than 10 megs and
     even with a 40Mhz 68040 processor, it takes several minutes to
     assemble.
           There are thousands of man hours in this project, and I am sure
     that we are nowhere near where we want to be.  But, as with the MAC
     emulation, upgrades will be readily available, and we welcome your
     suggestions to make this emulation module as productive as possible.

      Sincerely,

      Jim, Joe, & Mark

  CONCLUSION

     I think that after a few more updates this will be a fine, usable
  product.  As it stands, it is not very useful unless all you want to run
  are text-based DOS programs.

      ******************************  
        
        This month, as promised, we will add text to our "AmigaHelloWorld"
 program.  Programming the Amiga, can be as much fun as playing a game on 
 your Amiga, if you have the right attitude.  So if you have the tute, 
 I'm the tutor...

        Printing text to the window is very simple and you have two ways
 of going about it.

      *****--------------------------------------------------       
      * N *   I STRONGLY SUGGEST INVESTING IN THE COMPLETE  |
      * O *   SET OF AMIGA ROM KERNEL MANUALS... AT THE     |
      * T *   VERY LEAST YOU SHOULD TRY TO GET THE LIBRARIES|       
      * E *   MANUAL ...THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES/EXPLANATIONS|       
      *****--------------------------------------------------
        

 ==========================================================================

 FIRST WAY: INTUITEXT STRUCTURE
           To render text using Intuition, you must fill an IntuiText
           structure:
           
           struct IntuiText
           {
                UBYTE FrontPen, BackPen;
                UBYTE DrawMode;
                WORD  LeftEdge;
                WORD  TopEdge;
                struct TextAttr *ITextFont;
                UBYTE *IText;
                struct IntuiText *NextText;
           };     

        After filling the structure  you would call the PrintIText()
        function....
        
        *proto* 
        void PrintIText(struct RastPort *rp, 
                        struct IntuiText *iText,
                        long left, long top);
        
        I won't use this method for our simple program, but we will in the
 future.
        

 ==========================================================================

                          SECOND WAY: THE TEXT FUNCTION
                          
            The Text() function is in the graphics.library and is the
 method that we will use in our example program.  Since the funtion resides
 in the graphics.library we must open it.
            
       *proto*
       void Text(struct RastPort *rp,
                 STRPTR mystring, ULONG count);
                 
       ex.   C CODE
             .
             .
             .
             Text(rp,"Hello World",11);
             .
             .
             .
             END OF CODE
             
       In our example we simply called Text() passed a pointer to our
 RastPort, passed the string to print, and the number of characters
 in the string. Simple?
       
 ========================================================================

        
        With this knowledge, lets build on to our "AmigaHelloWorld" code.

That should do it ... a nice window with a nice greeting :)



                  NEXT MONTH: ADD A GADGET TO OUR WINDOW!!

        The gadget is the greatest invention known to man...at least in my
 book.
        
        Please let me know what you think of this column...I had one
 response to last month's article... one person in the whole world read the
 column???

     Due to a hard drive crash, we have lost much of our BBS list, and we
 did not have enough time to recompile it all.  In fact, we are not even
 sure if we wish to do it at all.  
     
     
     What do you guys think?  Should we include a BBS list?  Please mail
