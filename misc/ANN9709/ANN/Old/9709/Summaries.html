The blizzard cards will have the same type (not format) of connector

version of the CyberVisionPPC (4 MB, Permedia2) for it (price below 500 DM).
Due to CE-reasons, this will require a tower system. These enhancements

He thinks the only ones buying future Amigas will be <CITE>remaining Amiga
fanatics with money</CITE>. The A\Box will probably not succeed because
Phase5 don't have the necessary power and the PIOS One, PowerPC/CHRP might
go down with the entire Apple market. The AmigaOS won't survive either, as
it is highly unportable, being optimized around a specific hardware platform.
Too many Amiga companies have left, way too much time was wasted after Commodore's
demise. <CITE>Fanatical deviotion</CITE> moved the platform forward for years,

<P><FONT SIZE="4"><B>PowerUp history; according to Phase5
</B></FONT> (09-Sep-97
)</P>
<UL>The choice to go PowerPC was taken early october '95 when Motorola
began questioning volume production of the 68060. An alpha prototype
was shown on the Computer95 show; estimated time of arrival (ETA) was second
part of 1996. They then lost 4 months talking about possible cooperations
wih AT and then had to face an etire different situation with the bankruptcy
of Escom/AT. Another 4 months passed, there were talks with possible
Amiga buyers, but these were useless. Since there didn't seem to be
a solution to the AT (and AmigaOS) problem, they decided to adopt the
current dual-processor concept and began developing prototypes. These
were delivered to developers shortly before the Computer96, where they
also showed the first small demo application. ETA then was the first
quarter 1997. Delays since then were caused by restructuring
in the development team and the transforming of design to &quot;VHDL-synthesis&quot; [?].
The last 5 months of delays are Phase5's fault, although this time was
also used to further improve the design of the PowerUp boards and software.

<UL>Craig H. Ganoe quotes one of Phase5's web pages that explains how
the PowerUp will run.
<BLOCKQUOTE>While the original AmigaOS 3.x continues to run on the 68k CPU - as
well as all existing applications do, what provides 100%
compatibility - the PowerPC CPU is supported by a comprehensive PPC
Library developed by phase 5, which provides all functionality to
integrate the PowerPC into the Amiga multitasking environment.
Software developers can easily optimze their programs step by step by
porting single tasks to PowerPC code, which then can run parallel with
68k tasks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Craig reads this as AmigaOS 3.1 running on the 68k and if a programmer wants to run PPC
code, the programmer creates a subtask on the PPC using the PPC.library.
<CITE>Looks to me all the AmigaOS is the
same old 68k code (which makes sense to me since this is all
Copyrighted) and the programmer can write their own PPC subtasks to
do stuff for them.</CITE>
