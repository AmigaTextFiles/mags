   We thought about Amiga Unix even back at Amiga Technologies last year.
But the trouble is that a) the source code is lost and b) even if it were
available it would still need a lot of updating work. For example, Amiga Unix
does not support CD-ROM drives or the any processor more recent than the
68030. I agree that Amiga Unix was a great port of SVR4, the question remains
whether it still is today.
