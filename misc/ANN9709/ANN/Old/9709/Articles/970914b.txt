GW2k are not saying much yet, however they seem to be steadily working 
away in the background.  I would rather that they make steady progress 
towards a long term survivable future, instead of rushing in and dropping 
the whole thing in 6 months.

I disagree.  We are manufacturing 1 68k based Amiga model ("Access") at 
the moment and just completing the design on another ("Connect") which 
will be in manufacture before the end of the year.  I don't see the long 
term future as necessarily being 68k based, just because the '060 is the 
limit on performance, however that doesn't solve the immediate problem of 
where can you buy an Amiga.

We expect to be using 68k's in some of our products for a minimum of 3 
years, but in embedded/kiosk applications way beyond that.
