I'm a collector of police and military patches, and I recently through a
trade ended up with all the shoulder patches worn by the Commodore
Business Machines security guards.  They are round, light brown with a
Commodore logo in color in the center, and the words 'Commodore
Security' around the outside.  There are less than 150 total, and I'd
like ten dollars US each for them, or I'll consider trades or offers for
larger numbers of them, or trades for your own patches, if they are
subjects I need.
