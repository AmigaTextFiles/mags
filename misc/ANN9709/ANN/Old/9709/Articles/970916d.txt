Good ol' Amiga magazine and their "let's publish rumors as if they were
facts" <g>

Wouter hasn't dropped E development.  I chatted with him a few months ago,
and 3.3a wasn't out yet because of a dead monitor - programming on a TV is
hardly good for your eyes and your sanity.  More is, he was on holidays
until a few weeks ago AFAIK.

EDBG should be now updated by someone else (Jason Hullance I think?).
EasyGUI is already developped by someone else too, updates have been
available on Aminet since a few months.  This eases the workload off
Wouter's shoulders, without meaning he's dropping E itself.

The mailing list was also moved to another server.  The new one is found
at amigae-list@intercom.it.  I can't recall for sure how to subscribe on
it tho (I didn't kept the information after subscribing to it), but that
one is well alive, having a few posts a day usualy.

Hope that clarifies the situation a bit :)
