Hi everybody !

I've got some news that should make you happy ! ;-)

Ateo Concepts, a french hardware designer (who already created cool towers for
A1200, and some other devices like a PC keyboard interface or a multiple IDE
connector), have announced their new products ! And they seem absolutely
outstanding !

Indeed, they announce a new bus, that will replace the Zorro II/III buses in
A1200 towers, for a *very* cheap price, and better performances than Zorro III
buses ! As a first device for this new bus, they are about to release a new
64bits graphic card (named Pixel64), which should have a very good
performance for a low price.
Many other low priced devices are announced for this bus (ethernet cards, and
so on).

And they finally plan to build a PPC card !!

If you are interested, you can visit their web page (English text is also
available) at : http://www.ateo-concepts.com.

See you !

PS : I've got no relation with Ateo Concepts myself, but thought the information
was worth spreading... ;-)
