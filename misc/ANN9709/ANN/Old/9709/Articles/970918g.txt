While half-watching a show on Discovery Channel Sunday night about the B-2
Stealth Bomber, a B-2 pilot was talking about the computers and avionics
in the cockpit, and after the narrator of the show said that the cockpit
is devoid of the usual zillions of dials and gauges of earlier bombers,
the pilot talked about the computers and displays at his disposal, and how
(I'm paraphrasing here) "remember this plane was designed in the early 80s
and the computer we have on board is about equal to the power of an Amiga
from the mid-80s." 

I was half-expecting him to say "IBM-PC" or "XT" or something like that, 
but was quite surprised when the word "Amiga" came out of his mouth.
