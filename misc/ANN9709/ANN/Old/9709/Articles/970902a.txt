I have no idea what you're asking here.  Sure Phase5 owns the rights
to the technology they develop.  What's your point.  I just said I
don't want anything of it, at least until I know if it fits into AI's
plans for a PPC Amiga OS.

I wouldn't want to leave any Amiga owner out of the running, but I
wouldn't want to make the Amiga bound to some hacked up Amiga 
architecture either.

For example, say AI decides to make AmigaOS 4.0 CHRP (PReP, whatever
else you like to call it) compliant or an even better hardware
architecture for that matter (for those advocates out there of
a custom chipset Amiga).  Wow!  Great stuff we all say, but then
the whining starts.  Oh, but all us other people bought these cards
from Phase5.  Now AI has to make a decision.  To support this
totally different hardware architecture or not.  You do understand
the problem here don't you?  This is essentially two different OS's,
at the hardware level at least, that AI would have to develop and
support.  Plus, no software written for Phase5's boards will run
under this new AmigaOS (but that's another story too).

Sure, the PPC chip is the same, but the hardware interface to the
system is totally different.  In a portable OS (which is another
story), this is the hard part (hopefully the only part) of porting
the OS, because you have to write totally different code for every
architecture you support.

I really hope AI doesn't decide to delay coming out with a PPC Amiga
just because it has to write and maintain a PPC AmigaOS for Phase5's
boards as well.

Yep, Phase5 did the Amiga a service by developing 040 and 060
accelerators for many years and by developing advanced graphics
and SCSI solutions.  My hat's off to them (but of course you
understand they did this to make money) but, these new PPC
boards of theirs are their last shot at making money off the Amiga
before we see a shiny new PPC Amiga with PCI and all that good stuff
which will take a good share of their market (it's all really about
money).  Blind faith by Amiga owners that Phase5 is always looking
out for us good old Amiga owners because Commodore/AT/AI ain't will
lead to irreparable fragmentaion of the Amiga community.

The Amiga community didn't need a Commodore banner to stand under
before, they don't need a Phase5 one now.  The Amiga community
needs to stand together and decide what they want.  There are
people out there supporting that kind of effort now, support them.
(OK, somewhere in there I ended up on a soapbox ... I'll move on.)

What concerns me is that there are people out there blindly
preordering Phase5 PPC cards or anxiously awaiting their release,
not even understanding how they work.  People really need to
wait and understand and see the big picture.
