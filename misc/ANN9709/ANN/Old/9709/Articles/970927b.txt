Steve, It is not the lack of a development staff that prevents Gateway from
announcing their intentions.  Gateway has a past history of avoiding "vapor"
announcements, and this appears to be an ongoing company policy.

We have had, over the past three years, many announcements of fantastic 
projects which fall in the "killer Amiga" category, and none of them have
made it to hardware.  "Expecting to go this way", "looking at", and "planning
to do" have little validity in the real world, if it did we would all be using
those "killer Amiga's" right now.

I, for one, tend to favor the way Gateway has done business in the past
where they make their announcement about a new product when the production
line is running and the product is ready to ship.  There have been a number
of references to the existance of NDA's between various party's and Gateway.
There is no reason for a non-disclosure agreement if there is nothing to
disclose.  Since I am not priviliged to be a party to the NDA's, I'll just
have to wait until Gateway has made their decision and has progressed to the
point where they feel comfortable with announcing it.

Let's just hang in there for a while longer... after all, the situation with
the Amiga can't get WORSE, can it?

Myron
