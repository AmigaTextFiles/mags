You need hardware people to get the hardware working. This doesn't
overlap with any "Exec-porting" job, even if they were doing that.
Since they announced last year they weren't going to do an Exec clone,
my guess is, well, they won't do an Exec clone. 

You're hardly alone here, but there seems to be this sense that a
company can't walk and chew gum at the same time. And companies
themselves have tapped into this feeling. I remember Apple claiming
that they didn't have time to design CHRP hardware because they were
busy at work on Copland. Tell me their software engineers also do the
hardware -- right. Ain't happenin'.

That's a recipe for failure. If you work on every product at once (eg,
same people are working on multiple projects), you have a problem --
you run out of money. If you finish one, you get to sell it while the
next one is in the works. Plain everyday common sense.

Bullshit. They weren't doing ANYTHING for the Walker. The only talks
we had with Phase 5 at AT (and this back in late '95/early '96) of any
substance were about PPC upgrades to 68K machines. Basically, AT
wasn't interested in PPC upgrade cards, we assured Phase 5 we wouldn't
make them, and we might possibly be interested in bundling their
PowerUp card (already in the works, supposedly) with the Walker. Of
course, there was a chance the Walker's CPU slot would change, but [a]
they didn't know that, and [b] they pulled the plug on the project
before I had a chance to design the new CPU slot (the goal was making
the PPC easier to interface to the system bus). So even if they
desparately wanted to support the Walker, it was no different in any
way than supporting the A3000 or A4000.
