   Quite a lot, actually. Commodore did not collapse in an "orderly manner",
every piece of mobile property ended up in a warehouse, such as workstations
software packages, books and a large library of tapes (more than 600 whose
contents were still to be archived when Amiga Technologies went belly up).
Some of this material was sold off by ESCOM, some was transported to
Germany lateron. Legal documents, hardware schematics and manuscripts are
also lost. There is hope that some of the material may be on the few
hundred tapes, but I really don't know whether the process of archiving
their contents was ever completed.
