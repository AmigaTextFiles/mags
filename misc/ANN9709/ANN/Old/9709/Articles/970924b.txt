So you speak for AI? AFAIK your last statement about AI is a bloody lie.
Stop that.

Why not as a developer? We have officially asked for the license
to port AmigaOS to PPC. They did not yet grant it, but also did
not reject the wish for all times.

Re developer: Do you know who is appointed to care for developer
support? It's the ICOA. Do you know who is one of the founders of
ICOA? Dave Haynie. So he (and I'm also trying to contribute, perhaps
at least in the docs field) will contribute to support *Amiga*
developers. Any more questions?
