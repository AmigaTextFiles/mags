Hey, it's all true.  UAE *doesn't* handle AGA, nor will it run the current
release of p.OS, both of which current Amigas have done for quite some

Sure.

How about the fact that Amiga Inc is activly recruiting, and aim to have
30 developers on their payroll by the end of this year? Or the fact that
they have announced that AmigaOS 3.5 *WILL* be on general release by
Spring '98 at the latest? Or the fact that they have announced that they
are designing new hardware which will be available by Christmas '98?

Well, there's 3 to be going on with :)


TTFN,
Keith
