: Are the delays with the release of the cards due to technical problems?

probably not a technical issue since i saw working PowerUp cards more
than 4 months ago. Its probably more to do with trying to make sure that
when released, the product was perfect, the price of the PPC chips was
perfect and the supplied library had as much as possible in it - and
that all the support software was configured properly.

: If a full PPC port of AmigaOS is made will the card be able to run it
: without the need for the 68xxx CPU?

thats an unknown entity - thanks to AI being very quiet. Theres no
reason why the next AmigaOS cant come in 3 flavours 0x0, PowerUp and
CHrP PPC.

: Is the card fully useable as a 68xxx series accelerator, without utilising
: the PPC CPU... Is there any performance penalty as a result of the PPC CPU
: being present?

nope. as a 0x0 card it works perfectly fine - to that end, the PPC is
invisible. in fact, the memory bus is even faster.

: Do the PPC603e/603e+ cards come with SCSI included (ie: It's not an extra
: cost option).

from what i've seen on the page (and seen in print) it is built in.
