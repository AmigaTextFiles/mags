Hi all,

I've just been reading in this month's (September) edition of CU Amiga about
the rerelease of Civilization AGA on CD for 15. Sounds fantastic. I've never
played the game, but heard good things about it, and for fifteen quid I thought
I couldn't go wrong.

I read with interest the bit in the article about distribution. "[...]
Guildhall will stick primarily to Electronics Boutique in the hope that
concentrating Amiga software purchases in a single chain store will reduce the
chances of that store dropping shelf space [...]

"[...] If everyone who buys the CD edition of CU goes to their local branch of
Electronics Boutique and buys Civilization CD [...] in the last week of August,
it will force the shops to think again about their Amiga strategy."

Excellent thinking. I can go along with that.

So I went down to the Brighton branch of Electronics Boutique yesterday, and
perused the shelf (!). No sign of it. I asked at the counter, and was told,
"Sorry, we don't sell CDs for the Amiga." I said "Oh", and left disappointed.

So what the hell are these shops doing? It seems obvious to me that they are
*never* going to sell any quantity of these CDs, because they're not bloody
well selling them at all!

So much for Guildhall's selling strategies... :(
