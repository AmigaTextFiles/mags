Dave Haynie had something like this worked out (what seems like over
a year ago now).  If I remember right, it could sort of be compared to
an A1200, but basically PPC instead of 68k and reasonably powerful
standard PC graphics and audio chips instead of AGA.  Might have
been in the around $800 price range, but that was a year ago.
Maybe he could better comment on it.
