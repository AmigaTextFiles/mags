BS. Worms sold about 50000-60000 copies and that was less than two
years ago. Since then, I cannot think of one major release for the Amiga
which you can this compare with.

Alien Breed 2 - TKG? Except for being totally unplayable and slow as hell,
it was an good attempt. Worms - TDC? Although I think it was the best game on
the Amiga for ages, it was still an /update/, nothing more than an update.
Maybe a big one, but an update and not a brand new game. Some people were
already tired, some people thought they had payed enough for the first version
of Worms. And it was on three disks, not a CD, which made it very easy to
pirate. The upgrade deal wasn't done, which pissed a lot of people off, but
meant nothing to me. Still, it isn't hard to see why it didn't sell better.
It was also reviewed ages before it came out in the stores, which is seldom
a good thing.

Valhalla 3 sold about 8000 copies. That one is programmed in Amos in a couple
of months, and it wasn't distributed anywhere except for through Vulcan;
Well - almost. Valhalla 2 also sold about 8000 copies, Valhalla 1 sold 10000
copies. That was years before, and some people also grew tired after playing
the two first ones. Valhalla 1 also got more coverage ('the first ever Amiga
speech adventure', mixed reviews but a lot of them in a lot of different
mags). Now Vulcan are making Valhalla 4 and 5. I bet they sell at least close
to as well as Valhalla 1/2/3, if they are as good as they sound.
