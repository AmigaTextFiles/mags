That's your personal perception, shared not by everyone.

Now that hurts. I have to say that I also was negatively affected by
that move of JLG, but he has stopped that, now that he can get on
the masses of Mac users. What is different between Be and PIOS is
that they have something definitely different from AmigaOS, an OS
with a lot of ambitions and a lot of good aspects, but it's not
AmigaOS. We from PIOS, however, feel that we do something with our
PIOS ONE hardware which is practically what would have been the next
Amiga hardware from Commodore, like it or not! Yes, there was also
Hombre, but I've seen some docs where this was scheduled to become
either a games console, not necessarily much Amiga-like, or an own
gfx card with just an own kind of gfx chip instead of some from the
gfx card makers. And not to forget AAA, please note that this was
buried as a project even before Commodore closed. In total, it's highly
likely that Commodore would have gone hardware-wise in exactly this
direction where the PIOS ONE now develops.

What should we do? Sell 68k stuff? For a new company, this would mean
wasted effort, as the days of 68k are definitely counted. There has
to come a transition, and the best we can do with our limited resources,
we are doing: working on next-generation Amiga, as we think it should
look like and as probably Commodore would have also built it.

In which way is cloning with official licenses "stealing"? Yes, Apple
earned money from us via licenses, as we don't yet have some AmigaOS
of any kind for our hardware. What we currently sell is just exercises
in the PPC market, and for market-related reasons, this can only take
place in the Mac clone market, no way around that, sorry. Yet we don't
do PC clones, why do you mention those?

Nobody keeps you from that, but we're getting close as much as possible
to the real Amiga. Please keep in mind, we're on PPC processors, where
there is currently no official AmigaOS. So we have to find some
approximation, again as close as possible, via Siamese, via pOS, etc.

Well, I firmly belive that if it had been easily possible to use such
cards in the current Amigas, people would have done so, don't you think?
So why do you see a disadvantage in finally providing this? Again:
The next Amiga from Commodore would have had PCI slots.

It's a subtle point, but can become immensely efficient and practical
when it comes to upgrading. Ask Amiga owners with 040 or 060 cards
what power has been made accessible to them on base hardware of which
age.

So you use majorly the functionality of the custom chips? Weird.

Undebated. And we try to follow that tradition and help its transition
into new processor arenas.

Why is this a "but"?

> Mac lovers will love it,

Uh, they have problems with such an open platform, it frightens them
a bit... But some of them are of course open minded enough to appreciate
the advantages, but those can't be called typical Mac users, it seems.
It's more typical for Amiga folks to see such openness as an advantage.

Perhaps your error in perception is that Dave did *not* change his
attitude? He always just chose the way which was appropriate for the
time, and times *did* change. Think over it.
