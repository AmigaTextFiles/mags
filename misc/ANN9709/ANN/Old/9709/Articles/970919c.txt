They would of course have to pay a fee for the AROS source, but with GWs
income that should be no problem...
AROS will BTW be very simple to port to PPC, since it AFAIK only 
contains one asm file.
There was even some talk on the AROS mailinglist about porting
it to PPC Linux during WoA in Cologne, to show the portability.
AROS will also remain binary compatible on Amiga (unlike pOS), so
that no recompilation is needed.
