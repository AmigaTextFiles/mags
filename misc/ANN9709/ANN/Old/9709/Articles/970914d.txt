Let me interject here, and say, regardless of the above deleted rantings, the Amiga rc5 Team has picked up a massive amount of steam. :) (Keep in mind that we do not limit the team to only Amigas. It's about the Amiga spirit. Use any and all computers at your disposal!) Anyway, at this writing, we now have over 300 members on our team, with an unspecified number of machines (some have intermittent access to a large number of machines, thus helping, though not consistently) but it's over 400 machines constantly, at any rate. We currently rank #122 in the Bovine effort, with a rank of #11 in daily stats for yesterday, and still climbing. We should break the 100 mark in 2-4 days.                                                                                      
                                                                                           
 Our whole point in participating was to possibly generate some attention for Amiga, whether it be just by making it up through the ranks to a noticeable slots (we are headed well inside #30 currently, given enough time) or by breaking the actual key. So if you want to join in on the Amiga spirit, this is the team to do it with! I heartily encourage those on any other Amiga teams to join their efforts with our for the sake of the Amiga.   
                                                                                           
 JOIN! Join your friends. Join your business and your university. Your brother and your mother.. and your Alpha and your Pentium. :)
