Hmm, that's not really true. AT at Escom times proclaimed to aim for
the PPC, so a decision was made. The plan for the transfer was made,
and the second it should be put into reality, Escom pulled the plug,
because it went bellyup. Also the Walker had already become reality,
ok, it was just three prototypes, but they did run Amiga software.
And they were designed with a powerful expansion connector, where
also PPC processor cards were imagined to be used.
