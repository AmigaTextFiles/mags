Yea, just like all those new Word Processors that are out on the PC,
and those hundreds, no, Thousands, no Quadrillions of new Spreadsheet
programs, too.  Yes Microsoft Office just has soo much competition now
days in it's market.

My goodness, people must have problems keeping up with all the new
Photoshop Wanna-bees on the PC!  And the 3D programs, fields of them!

It's amazing how PC users have so much time, considering all of the
New Titles that are out there, to come into an Amiga Newsgroup at all!

The Amiga has been declaired dead more times than Elvis, been
declaired out-dated more times than Jesse Helms, and yet they are
still selling, and people are still anticipating the next-generation
Amiga.  Developers are still developing for them, and users are still
using them.  The Amiga is doing much better than anyone should have
expected of it, especially considering it's history.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  Most of the Amiga
Community seem to be waiting to see what direction they should take
their 'wares--what direction GW2k is going to take the Amiga.

This is part of the problem that PIOS' TransAM has -- they didn't
wait.  Rather than sitting on their thumbs until the entire Bankruptsy
mess got cleaned up, they went out and did something.  Now, hopefully
for them, their efforts will somehow fit into GW2k's vision of the
Amiga's future.

As for new software, what exactly do you want?  I've been dedicating
every spare minute (which there are admittedly fewer of) trying to
learn the new Amiga programs that just came out in the last month or
so.  Aladdin4D, of which I've just figured out the basics of, seems
capable of generating increadible images!  Wordsworth 6 (Yes, it's
been out for a while, but I just got it a few months ago) seems
capable of more than I had anticipated.

The truth is, with the software that I've gotten in the last six
months, I find myself doing more and more on the Amiga.  The only
thing that I really want out of my Amiga is more speed, but I want
more speed not simply to have speed, but to run my *Amiga* programs at
higher speeds.

There's been plenty of new things coming out on the Amiga.  If you're
not happy with them, then move onto something that you are happy with.
