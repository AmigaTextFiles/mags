I doubt it. If these guys even know about the Amiga patents, they're
either worried about, or working around, the chipset patent. Which is
basically about the blitter (we always called it "the blitter patent",
but it's actually, in the way of patents, covering the points of the
original Amiga chipset that were unique at the time).

I don't know about that. One way or another, graphics chip companies
have moved architecturally in the Amiga direction on 2D stuff. Most of
the chips support three operand blits, line draw, area fill, etc. In
fact, this was all "standardized" in IBM's XGA chipset. No one exactly
cloned XGA, but many of the SVGA chipsets have grown in that direction
over the years.

The only primary features that Windows would not use are copper and
HAM. When you see you can update a typical PCI display in 24-bit
faster than any Amiga can update a HAM8 screen, at equal resolutions,
it does put a certain spin on the whole HAM thing. AAA had some more
useful built-in compression modes, but in this day of cheap memory and
fast buses, it's questionable if even that would be all that useful
today.

>>Yeah, 8 bit voice. Oh boy.

The internal cost (something closer to the real cost than what you
would pay at replacement prices) for AA was about $15.00 for the three
chips. But you wind up with another $20 or so in support logic: fast
PALs, buffers, part of Gary/Gayle/Akiko, the DAC, etc. 

That's price comparable to off-the-shelf parts today, it's just that
you get so much more in the off-the-shelf parts. A SuperI/O chip,
which supplies keyboard, mouse, two RS-232s, parallel, floppy, and
maybe some general purpose I/O runs around $10-$15, depending on
specifics (add $2 for two 8520s into the Amiga side of things here).
A cheap 64-bit graphics chip with PCI interface and on-board clock
synthesizer and DAC, maybe only 5x-10x faster than the Amiga chips,
runs $15-$20, depending on who's you buy. A cheap 16-bit DAC costs
about $1.00, but it's not something you can directly hook to a
personal computer (these tend to run I2S or some-such serial bus). A
16-bit CODEC runs around $5.00, for stereo audio in and out. If you
pay more, you can get MIDI, synthesis, and game ports on the same
chip.

One big problem with sound cards is that, regardless of whether or not
they'll handle 16-bit digital audio, there's still plenty of stuff out
there using the old SoundBlaster FM synthesizer. Or 8-bit sampling.
Meanwhile, everything on the Amiga is at least 8-bit sample based,
which does sound better than the FM (any decent MOD file will convince
you of this). And cheap sound cards aren't made very quietly. But put
that in prespective -- you're not likely to find anything worse than
maybe 70-75dB S/N (good stuff in 16-bit runs up around 90dB). That's
better quality that you can get from FM radio, or most folks cassette
tape machines (yes, a professional or audiophile tape deck with metal
tape can exceed this). The point being, the systems are capable of
sounding as good as most of the music most people listen to. If it
doesn't, blame the source material, not the hardware. Or blame
yourself, if you an audiophile expecting to get awesome sound from
cards made by computer people. Get a real sound card if you need
something better, start at around $250...

I wager, if someone came knocking at their door, asking to license the
Amiga chipset, for the purpose of making a clone (or improvement),
Gateway wouldn't let them out the door without signing on the dotted
lines. Chipset development is expensive -- they'd just at the chance
of getting someone else to pay for this.

$250 million? Get real. Intel may spend $100 million on a new CPU, but
they're pushing the limits of a poor and ancient architecture. And
they have the money. You're talking under $25 million for the whole
chip project, at least at an existing design center. If Gateway did
it, they'd have a fairly substantial investment to make in Suns,
software, designers, etc. 

You could easily spend $50 million on advertising, and another $50
million paying for applications to be ported.

On paper, they can't take a loss on the hardware, that's dumping, it's
illegal, at least in the US. Of course, they don't have to make a
profit, either. But don't think any reasonable new Amiga chipset
wouldn't also be 100% from scratch (well, unless you hooked up with
Hepler and got his post-Hombre ideas). You're not going salvage
anything from AA. Not a transistor.

And given that 90% of the supporters have A500s or A1200s, that's not
the hard target. Building something that's very exciting at the $500
price point means making something that would still be interesting at
$1000, but still managing to sell it for $500, at a profit.

The base gfx card contains a 2D chip. No one makes them without
blitters anymore.

Most of the basic PCI cards, 64-bit DRAM based things, are around the
$50 price point, especially if you buy "generic" cards, not Diamond or
Number Nine or such. Which isn't much of a risk -- the whole thing is
just graphics chip and memory. There's a Trident chip with video
output, including 3-line flicker filtering and 2D acceleration, for
around $50 new. S3's Virge is just over $50 (I think I paid about $60
last Spring for the card in my garage), while their 2D-only stuff is
below $50.
