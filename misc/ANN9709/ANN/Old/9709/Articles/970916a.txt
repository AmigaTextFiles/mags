The source is in a complete mess; there is no Makefile or script to pull
it all together.  I suspect only Andy Clitheroe actually knows which
files need to be linked together to build the damn game.  Frankly it's
probably easier to disassemble and patch the executable, which is what
the TKGpatch author did.

If an ELSPA member started giving away ex-commercial games, it might
risk getting kicked out of ELSPA, which would be undesirable.
