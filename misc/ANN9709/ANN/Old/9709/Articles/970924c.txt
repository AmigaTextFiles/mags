This is true. DEC got involved because they really want to be more in
the chip business than they have been; they have strong chip
technology, and well, the computer business has been better. While the
Alphas are clearly great for performance at any price applications,
they had no chip for typical embedded applications. The ARM folks did,
of course, but theirs was grossly underperforming compared to all the
other embedded RISC spinoffs, from MIPS, SPARC, PowerPC, etc. when
power wasn't quite as much of an issue (and we're not talking such a
vast difference here). It was a good match.

It's not even a close match for a decent PowerPC or Pentium II. Of
course, there's quite a bit more to it than that. The OS is one
problem, and Acorn's RISCOS has plenty of shortcomings, but Mac or
Windows-like bloat are not among them. 

And folks who think this is just a crutch to wack away at those more
successful, think again. I have done tons of DTP in my time, 100 page
manuals for things like Zorro III on the Amiga, other specs, etc. I
recently had the displeasure of using Word for Windows, version 7, for
a 150 page document for Scala, since it's their standard
wordprocessor. And that, my friends, is some experience. With a
minimum of graphics, a few fonts, some nested headers, running on a
150MHz Pentium under Windows NT, this wordprocessor's performance was
abysmal. It was so slow in WYSIWYG mode as to be unusable. My A3000
running FinalWriter, also in WYSIWYG mode, also on a 150 page
document, in practically the same resolution (1180x900 for the Amiga,
1280x1024 for the PC, and the PC's graphics engine is about 50x
faster). There's no contest in CPU or memory speed here. The
difference is just algorithm and OS. 

Of course, a good OS on a PowerPC is still going to run 2x-20x faster
than a good OS on a StrongARM, or more, depending on just how much
floating point matters, versus waiting for I/O and stuff (everyone
waits at the same speed; a good OS lets the CPU do other stuff during
the wait, Windows rarely does).

Floating point isn't very important to embedded applications, hence
the ommission. Make no mistake about it: RISCOS is small potatos. DEC
wasn't making StrongARM for the desktop, and nothing they're doing is
for anything other than making a fast chip for embedding, running off
batteries, etc.

PC users run it at 30fps+ in 1024x768. I've done this myself (since
Scala got their T1 connection, a few folks there have taken to playing
net-Quake on some of the nicer PCs they keep around for showing off
Scala). Floating point is critical to most modern games. It's not a
big deal for wordprocessing and some other desktop applications, most
multimedia-type things, pre-1992-style games, that sort. It's even
more critical for 3D renedering, the kind of stuff the Amiga once
ruled.

That's another thing that's no big deal when you're building embedded
systems. A pure embedded application (eg, a camcorder or a TV set, not
a more general purpose handheld computer) will often load up critical
variables in the on-chip cache and then freeze them. Meanwhile, a
faster local bus gets your DRAM and all eating more power. EDO is
rather passe', modern systems use synchronous DRAM, which on 66-75MHz
buses delivers about as much a boost over EDO as EDO does over FPM.
Once you get to 100MHz, anything but SDRAM is a waste.

In practical PowerPC systems, we've often seen ar doubling of the
system performance going from 33MHz buses without L2 cache to 66Mhz
buses with fast L2 cache. This is exactly what you need for desktop
performance, it's not going into embedded systems.

Actually, it plays fairly well to any other big-endian processor.
Obviously they'd have to write their own RTAS, which is normally in
PPC machine code (compiled C), but all the Open Firmware code is CPU
independent. Most of CHRP is based around common PClone standards,
too. Had it kicked into high gear, it would have made PCI cards with
Open Firmware drivers much more popular, again benefitting anyone
supporting the CHRP firmware system, PPC or no PPC.

They couldn't use a CHRP motherboard, but they could modify a CHRP
motherboard for use with a StrongARM chip and PCI bridge. That doesn't
address the memory or cache controllers, but it does take care of
everything on PCI. Obviously using a PowerPC bus would take care of
that stuff too, but it's unlikely DEC would have done that. Plus, if
you're stealing a bus, taking the x86 bus (well, one of them anyway)
would get you even cheaper motherboards.

Decline or no decline, reinventing the wheel is a bad way to spend
money.
