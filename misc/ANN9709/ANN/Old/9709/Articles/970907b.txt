: "He doesn't support it." He does support it, hence the SASG website.

Accepting registrations is hardly "support" IMHO :)

: And he doesn't develop it anymore because registrations are lacking. 

Might be interesting to ask the users why they don't register it...  My
personal guess would be "we do not register because the actual product no
longer suits our needs enough to be worth paying".


: As for the "lies" in the faq, I can't judge on that really,
: although I can't imagine he would just make up texts like the one
: he quoted from the introduction text to NI. What you're saying is
: that he did make that up?? 

First of all, that text was an opinion letter included in NEwIcons V1,
about 4 or 5 years ago.  The opinion letter was written by Roger McVey, a
guy who did an iconset for the NewIcons system, written by NICOLA
SALMORIA.  There's the first nuance: Roger McVey isn't NewIcons's author,
he's an artist who did an iconset using that icon scheme.

That text was removed when V2 was released years ago, Roger McVey hasn't
been seen alive in years, NewIcons changed hands, but he's still keeping
outdated stuff on that website without mentioning its exact source.

Neither me nor Philip Vedovatti (the current artist working on NI
iconsets) are endorsing Roger's text.   We're accepting it as it is: a
personal opinion.  However, we're not happy at having someone else reply
with his own opinion in a FAQ, which is suppossed to be a source of
information, not of propaganda and personal feelings.

I guess I could reply with some nasty witty text in NI4's docs, but I
won't.  My answer to Martin will be coming through my compiler's (and
Phil's PPaint) mouth, namely NewIconsV4, due out in the next few weeks.
We "fight" with a product, not with a website.

Anyway, I don't wish to start again this whole story.  Just wanted to be
sure Team NewIcons's position in that matter is well known and
established.  My personal feeling is: let the customer decide which one
they prefer.  No need to attact the other product, just release your
product, promote YOUR product, and let the facts talk by themselve.
