Dec discontinued the chip MacroSystem was planning to use, that's why there's
no Dec Alpha accelerator. Another renderaccelerator board is beeing developed,
there's no public info. on what chip this board is based on. DraCo is a Video
Workstation and here the issue is to get as close to realtime renderings as
possible. The accelerator could be based on any chip since it would only be
used for lightning fast renderings, the 060 will still be used. The AmigaOS
flies on an 060, what's needed is renderingspeed. The PowerUP boards will also
only be used to speed up stuff like rendering, at least until there's a
new/updated OS.

I think a single PPC will be to slow for the task of fast renderings on a
DraCo. A quick DSP may also be the ticket.
