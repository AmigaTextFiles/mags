Sorry for replying to something that's a week old but I could shed
some light on this. Our policy in this regard isn't out of choice,
it's dictated by law. We can't refuse to take Gordon Harwood's
advertisements however we can refuse to take advertisements from our
direct competetors.

I assure you, we aren't happy about the Harwood adverts at ALL but
hopefully our readers are intelligent enough to discount them
altogether.

At one stage the tide of criticism that Harwood's received for the
advert persuaded them to drop it. However it appear latter with an
editorial style blurb that wasn't so factually incorrect at least.
