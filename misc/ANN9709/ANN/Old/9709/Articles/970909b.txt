It surely would. However many Amiga users wouldn't be happy about the idea
of using Intel..

The usual arguement is: 1. PPC is better/faster (There isnt THAT much
difference IMO). 2. Some PPC work has already been done. 3. The PPC
can emulate 680x0 code very fast and fairly easily (The one BIG plus
point, I suppose). 4. There will (eventually... ;) be PowerPC boards from
Phase5 which will work alongside a 680x0 chip, and give CURRENT Amigas
both PPC AND 680x0 compatibility..

However, my next computer will be Intel based in one way or another, and
I dont plan on buying a new computer for a LONG time.. Choosing PPC
would mean that I wouldn't run a next gen Amiga OS.. But if an Intel
based solution was chosen, I probably would, and so would many other former
Amiga users (Most of whom use Intel based machines also, rather than any
PPC machine).

Also, in reality, if you are going to rebuild the OS from scratch on
a different processor, it COULD just as easily be done for an x86
solution, as for PowerPC, The only difference being that PowerPC
already comes with fast 680x0 emulation, if required.

RUMOURS (And I stress that) are circulating in the Mac community
at the moment, that Motorola are actually considering if they
should discontinue the PowerPC! - After all, the next gen Apple OS
WILL be able to run on x86, as it will have platform independence.
So Apple would no longer be tied down to the PowerPC range...

Overall I think they would be far better off going for x86 or
being plaftform independant, rather than the PowerPC, which has a
very small market compared to the intel and intel clone makers..
But dont expect ecomonic reasoning from most current Amiga owners ;)
Besides, up till now, Gateway have gave us every reason to suspect that
they are not interested in building a new Amiga OS.. :(
