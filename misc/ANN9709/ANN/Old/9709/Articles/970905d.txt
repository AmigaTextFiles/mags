I was pretty impressed by the Casablanca.  I don't want to argue about whether
it has linear editing or not (I was under the impression that it did),
but it's more than good enough for most amature and semi-pro video editors.

I also heard that they're picking up Draco again, and have recently hired
a team of developers to make more software for it, and position it as the
"big professional brother" of Casablanca.
