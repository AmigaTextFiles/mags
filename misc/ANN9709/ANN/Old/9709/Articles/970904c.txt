Thanks for pointing this out.  This is on
http://www.phase5.de/news/projectinfo/ose.html

Well, that's at least some good news for people considering Phase5's
PPC cards.  Unfortunately, I did figure out some other stuff from
going over Phase5's web pages again.

The same web page mentioned the PPC exec.library they developed,
"As we had announced earlier, we do have a fully AmigaOS 3.1 Exec
running, and had other OS-compatible functionalities under
development." (note it said "had") and proceeds to say:
"However, a next generation OS needs significant enhancements, so we
can't see that an OS which is extremely close to the AmigaOS 3.x can
fullfill the demands."

Which essentally seems to be an excuse as to why they won't use it
(my guess some Copyright issues may some into play there as well).

Then I found some other pages that seem to explain how the PPC
will work under AmigaOS 3.1.  On the web page:
http://www.phase5.de/news/oldnews/cybppce.html it says:
"While the original AmigaOS 3.x continues to run on the 68k CPU - as
well as all existing applications do, what provides 100%
compatibility - the PowerPC CPU is supported by a comprehensive PPC
Library developed by phase 5, which provides all functionality to
integrate the PowerPC into the Amiga multitasking environment.
Software developers can easily optimze their programs step by step by
porting single tasks to PowerPC code, which then can run parallel with
68k tasks."

Well, there's the PPC.library that people mentioned.  I read this as
AmigaOS 3.1 running on the 68k and if a programmer wants to run PPC
code, the programmer creates a subtask on the PPC using the 
PPC.library.  Well, that's multiprocesssing, but it's none of the
fancy schemes people were posting here where parts of AmigaOS were
on the 68k and others on PPC.  Looks to me all the AmigaOS is the
same old 68k code (which makes sense to me since this is all
Copyrighted) and the programmer can write their own PPC subtasks to
do stuff for them.  Of course this still leaves some open issues
(like what level of access the PPC has to the AmigaOS), but this
fits a lot closer to how I thought these boards would work.

On a brighter note, I did see a post in c.s.a.misc "AmigaOS, Linux
on PowerUp" that implied that a Linux port for these boards may
be in the works (I don't know if this is from a reputable source
or not, so don't quote me on it).
