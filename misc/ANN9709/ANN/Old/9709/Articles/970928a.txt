I have to say I'm not sure what to think of Petro's speech.  I haven't
yet seen a complete transcript, but what I have heard of it sounds very
different from the apparent policy of Amiga Inc.  (For a few clues on
this, go to <URL:http://www.cnct.com/~rlv/jms/> and check out the latest
report in "NewsHound".)  I wonder whether Petro is really in touch with
reality at the moment.
