    I have finally found the time to release the source to the DICE compiler.
    It's pretty much as-is, I'm sorry to say, but still a pretty good piece
    of work even now.  The release is roughly equivalent to the last
    commercial release that we (OIC) did.

    The core source will compile on the Amiga and can also be compiled on
    most UNIX platforms.  It generates 68000 output and all files are output
    in the amiga's binary, object, and library file formats.  Embedded 68000
    support is included, which is basically what I use it for these days.

    Sources for the complete system: dcc, dcpp, dc1, das, dlink, and dobj
    have been released along with a bunch of other stuff.  Since I still
    use DICE for embedded hardware projects, it isn't *totally* obsolete.

    The code should easily compile on an Amiga or a FreeBSD box and ought
    to compile reasonably well on other UNIX boxes.  The code can be
    retrieved from the Obvious Implementations Corp. web site:

    I haven't done much work on the Amiga recently.  Some of you might have 
    heard that I got caught up in an ISP startup <wry grin>.  That was about
    3 years ago and I've been working at it ever since.  Thank god we don't 
    have to deal with Microcruft NT.  It's FreeBSD all the way.  I'm doing 
    mostly UNIX work these days... back to my root's, in fact, as I was using 
    BSD 4.2 at UC Berkeley a couple of years before the Amiga came out.

    In anycase, DICE is probably my finest piece of code.  I hope people get
    some use out of the core and libraries.
