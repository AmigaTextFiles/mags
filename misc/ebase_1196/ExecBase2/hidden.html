	Hidden Fields

<H2>
	How They Are Used
</H2>
<P>
	Most shopping carts uses the &lt;FORM&gt; tag. Iside that you can make
	different fields which contain data. Most often you will see those fields,
	and you can change the contents or add to them.
</P>
<P>
	Often, though, the programmer need to pass data around to different pages,
	and then they often use hidden fields, that is form fields which is set
	to TYPE="hidden".
</P>



<H2>
	Problems
</H2>
<P>
	The problem with hidden fields is that if the user leaves the site, the data
	is lost (well, not if the page still is in the cache of the user).
