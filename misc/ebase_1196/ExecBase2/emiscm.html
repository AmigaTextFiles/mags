    Hello!

</h3>

<P>

    Please forgive the pseudo-Victoriana opening -- just my way of
    saying that this article is going to be an inch thick and a
    mile wide. I want to discuss the following issues; bugs and
    debugging, organisation and support of other E coders, the
    E mailing list, the effect of the weather on my code, the
    random nature of computer problems, the future of the Amiga,
    Bill Gates' plans for world domination, the current situation
    in Bosnia, and anything else that I can reasonably drag in
    without it seeming too forced. [grin]

<P>

    Oh, and I'll also include an interesting code snippet. I can't
    really take credit for writing this one - it's a translation
    from C, the 'term' source by Olaf Barthel, to be precise.
    It enables Workbench-launched programs to clone the Workbench
    path list. This is very handy for programs like the compiler
    frontend that I am writing - it means you don't need to specify
    the full path for everything within the settings of the program
    itself. If you're actually reading this column just to see what
    code tips you can glean from the pearls of wisdom I cast before
    you all, you may as well go directly <a href="#wbpath">here</a>
    or <a href="#privacy">here</a>.

<P>

    I <i>was</i> working on the ultimate file handling module
    to present to you all, but time constraints intervened -- maybe
    next month, if I get the time. Writing the code isn't a
    problem, but checking it in enough situations that I won't
    look foolish when I publish it takes more time than I'd prefer,
    especially with the <a href="#heat">weather</a> as it is here.

<P>

    Anyway, read on, enjoy the show, get what you can out of it
    and write to <a href="mailto:agraham@hal9000.net.au">me</a>
    if you want to comment on anything...

    Why is that my ability to write decent, legible code goes out
    the window when the temperature tops 30° C? I've been looking
    across some of the code I've written in the last fortnight or
    so and, despite the comments I leave scattered through it, I
    still can't make any sense of it.

<P>

    One of the things I've noticed is that, now that I've reached a
    reasonable level of competency in programming, is that I don't
    make errors based on an inadequate understanding of the OS or
    the language design. No, now I know how to approach the more
    difficult topics. The mistakes I <i>do</i> make are the glaringly
    obvious ones that I don't pick up because my brain is working
    on a much more abstracted and rarefied level. I'm not sure
    whether this is a good or a bad thing, but it's extremely
    frustrating :@.

    One thing that I think the E programming community needs is some
    focal point to organise around. A venue to congregate, projects
    to work on together, a place to store tips, tricks and code
    examples, somewhere a little more conducive to interaction
    than the 'dev/e' directory on Aminet.

<P>

    <a href="http://www.wctv51.com/aee/index.html">The E Encyclopedia</a>
    looked like a good place when it opened, but that was many months ago
    and nothing on the site seems to have changed since :(. I mailed the
    people who were working on it, but never received a reply...

<P>

    I think that we need a similar organis(m|ation) to serve a
    number of purposes; both archival and supporting future
    growth, as a central clearing-house for ideas about the
    direction of the language, or for code modules that people
    want others to write, or even for feedback to authors
    on their programs. I am sure that there are many other
    needs that could also be served by such a (web site/mailing
    list/... whatever) Because news service with my (cheap) ISP is
    pretty bad and
    <a href="news:comp.sys.amiga.programmer">comp.sys.amiga.programmer</a>
    is always at least three months out of date, I feel isolated from
    what is probably the main meeting-place for Amiga programmers.

<P>

    Contact me on the address above if you want to discuss this
    further, or talk about starting something up; I'll do
    something about this only if I am convinced that the
    facility would actually be of use to other people.

<P>

    There used to be the E mailing list, but...

    I've tried mailing the E mailing list request address a number of times. My
    mails never get returned, so they seem to be ending up in some Internet
    equivalent of the dead letter office.... caught in e-mail limbo. Now, I've
    been trying to work out exactly what's happened to the list, and I came up with the
    following possibilities:

<P>

<DL>
<LH></LH>

    <DT><b>It's stopped</b><dd>    Probably the most likely outcome, but it sounds pretty
                           boring to me.

<P>

    <DT><b>Someone has stolen it</b><dd>    OK, if you put it back promptly I won't tell
                                    anyone.

<P>

    <DT><b>It's a conspiracy</b><dd>    They're all circulating my plaintive emails and
                                laughing at me because they won't let me on the list.

<P>

    <DT><b>Solipsism</b><dd>    Actually, the Internet is just a figment of my imagination.
                        So is the E programming language, and the Amiga computer...

<P>

    <DT><b>None of the above</b><dd>    Or it could be something even more outlandish
                                than I've been able to imagine...

</DL>

<P>
<P>

    If anyone can help me discover what's happened, it would be muchly appreciated.
    If the list has stopped, maybe we could kickstart an effort for a new one, or
    organise a similar means of communication (private newsgroups or somesuch).

<P>

    Anyway, raving over, onwards to more serious matters...

</h3>

<P>

    Before you look at this, a warning -- it works for me, but I am not
    100% sure of the intricate details of C-to-E translation... so
    consider it a pretty good first try. Complaints on a postcard to
    the usual address, please...

<P>

    The code for the module itself can be reached by clicking on
    <a href="fixpath.html">this</a> word.

    There is only one <code>PROC</code> exported - that is <code>attachCLI()</code>,
    which takes one argument; a pointer to the Workbench startup message. I usually call
    it in the following manner:

<P>

<pre>MODULE '*fixpath', 'workbench/startup'

PROC main()

    DEF su:PTR TO wbstartup

    -> have we run from WB or CLI?
    IF (su:=wbmessage)<>NIL

        /* Get other info from the wbmessage */

        attachCLI(su)

    ELSE

        /* do CLI specific stuff... */

    ENDIF


    /* etc......*/

ENDPROC

</pre>

    <code><b>wbmessage</b></code> is, of course, a builtin variable, part of the E spec,
    that contains a pointer to the Workbench startup message. You could integrate the
    check for the Workbench startup into the module itself, but I prefer to make it
    a part of the main program, as other details (like the name of the program, and so
    on) can be obtained from <code><b>wbmessage</b></code> as well.

<P>

    <a name="privacy">Hiding your <code>PRIVATE</code> parts</a>

</h3>

<P>

    When constructing objects in modules, one of the problems with
    <code>EXPORT</code>ing the object is that all of the methods
    of the object are able to be accessed by the casual user. For
    example, if you set up an object like this:

<pre>
OBJECT example

    sigbit

    PRIVATE

    internals

ENDOBJECT

PROC public_init() OF example

    -> blah blah blah....

ENDPROC

PROC private_a(complex_variable) OF example IS self.private_b(100, complex_variable)

PROC private_b(x, y) OF example

    -> more blah blah...

ENDPROC

</pre>

    then <b>ShowModule</b> will give you an output something like this...

<pre>
(----) OBJECT example
(   4)   sigbit:LONG
         public_init()
         private_a(a)
         private_b(a, b)
(----) ENDOBJECT     /* SIZEOF=12 */

</pre>

    when you most certainly <i>don't</i> want the last two procedures to
    be open to the public. Maybe in a future version of E Wouter can add
    an extra command to handle this, or extend the range of the
    <code><b>PRIVATE</b></code> operator to cover methods as well;
    I would like to define a method which was private to an object like this:

<pre>

PROC private_b(x, y) OF example PRIVATE

    -> more blah blah...

ENDPROC

</pre>

    but this is sadly not possible at the moment.

<P>

    For now, the fix is revert to a little bit of standard (i.e.
    non object-oriented) code. If the last two procedures are defined
    as follows:

<pre>

PROC private_a(ex:PTR TO example, complex_variable) IS private_b(ex, 100, complex_variable)

PROC private_b(ex:PTR TO example, x, y)

    -> more blah blah...

ENDPROC

</pre>

    (and, of course, <code><b>OPT EXPORT</b></code> is not enabled)
    then the private procedures will remain truly private. This is
    something of a kludgey approach to something that could easily
    be handled in the language implementation; we can only hope that
    this will be changed in the future.

    OK, I understand. You've got better things to do than sit around in front
    of your computer. Until next time, then...
