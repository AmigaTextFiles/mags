<H1>
	C++ and CGI programming - introduction.
</H1>



<H2>
	Background
</H2>
<P>
	Two and a half year ago when I started studying computer software engineering
	there wasn't much talk about the Web. Of course I knew about the Internet and
	e-mail, irc, ftp, etc., therefore I used them.
</P>
<P>
	I had heard about the Web, seen some pictures in Byte and I knew the concept of
	hypertext from AmigaGuide on the Amiga, which I used very often.
</P>
<P>
	In our second year we put up or own <A HREF="http:afrodite.hibu.no:8001/">
	Web server</A>, and made Web pages. I waited for half a year before publishing
	my 20 or so pages, which I did in <A HREF="http:afrodite.hibu.no:8001/paulken4/text/">
	this style</A> which I was very pleased with. (And still is, as a matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't long before I found the need for more 'functionality', I wanted a
	'Guestbook'. Therefore I learned CGI (C++ I already knew from our classes) and
	made it myself. Why bother to reinvent the wheel (in the Guestbook case), well
	no-one had made something as good or userfriendly as my Guestbook of course.
</P>



<H2>
	The Project Idea
</H2>
<P>
	Then during the spring of 1996 an idea formed in my head, why not make a Web
	administration tool? Of course this has been done before, but not on the Amiga
	or the HP-UX, and what I knew (and know) of other tools, they lack the most
	important part of computing, automatation and simplification.
</P>
<P>
	The project I will undertake is two part:
	<UL>
		<LI>Web server application
		<LI>GUI driven administration
	</UL>
	The problem from your standpoint is that I don't know how to program the
	Amiga GUI properly (I have to use...MUI Builder), therefore I'll concentrate on
	a text version of the administartion tools.
</P>
<P>
	Another problem is that some of my ideas are pretty darn hot, so I don't want
	to spill my beans, therefore what you get from this series of articles are some
	tools which aren't yet on the Amiga, but which are found on other platforms. (One
	reason I am writing this article series is that I'm a member of an organization
	which needsthis software.)
</P>


<H2>
	The Project Requirements
</H2>
<P>
	What we want for this system is the following:
	<UL>
		<LI>Processing of digital transfer of money
		<LI>Processing of <A HREF="http://www.intrasoft.no/~komplett/shopping.html">shopping-cart</A>
		<LI>Processing of members voting
		<LI>Accounting of digital money transfer
		<LI>Automatic updating of RFC documents
	</UL>
	Probably I will add some requirements with time. The first and third items on the
	list is some time into the future, ADF hasn't decided which company to use with the
	digital money transferring yet.
</P>



<H2>
	Known Problems
</H2>
<P>
	The CGI package from NCSA is in C, and it's fairly cryptic code as well, so the first
	thing I have to do is make my own C++ library which does the same. But, there might
	be some (I've tried quite a few, and hasn't been satisfied with any) library already
	out which can help us, so if you know any good, give me a hint, and I will also look
	around for myself.
</P>
<P>
	Time is a problem, I really should be concentrating on some projects which we have been
	assigned (and some chosen) at school, but I have promised John to help out, and this is
	a good way to structure my own thoughts and programming.
</P>



<H2>
	Specifications
</H2>
<P>
	I'll just as well start with some specifications.
</P>

<H3>
	Shopping-cart
</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>
		<P>
			The shopping-cart should work with all browsers, therefore it is important to implement
			it both as <A HREF="cookie.html">cookie-based</A>, and as a <A HREF="hidden.html">hidden-field</A>
			based CGI application.
		</P>
	<LI>
		<P>
			The customer should be able to query it's contents.
		</P>
	<LI>
		<P>
			Items in it should be hypertext linked to item descriptions.
		</P>
	<LI>
		<P>
			The prices should be automatically converted to local currencies.
		</P>
	<LI>
		<P>
			Postage and handling should be automatically be added.
		</P>
		<P>
			<I>Not needed by ADF.</I>
		</P>
</UL>



<H3>
	Administration
</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>
		<P>
			The program should help avoiding duplication of work.
		</P>
</UL>



<H2>
	Next Article
</H2>
<P>
	In the next article I will go through the basics of CGI programming and Forms, then I will
	start programming the CGI/HTML class.
</P>
<P>
	At the moment I haven't done much more than a sparse outline of the project,
	I'll refine it over time, and I'll also concider wishes and ideas for the
	project.
</P>
