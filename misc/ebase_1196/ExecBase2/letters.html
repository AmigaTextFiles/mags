<h3>Some Thoughts On Issue #1</h3>
<p>
General: How about makeing an AGuide Version ? There are some HTML2AGuide
conversion utilities so it should be not that much complicated (with HTDS
even the inline images could be used).
</p><p>
MultiThreading: I can't yet say much more than it was very interesting and
would solve some of the (somewhen) upcoming problems with my Pertergrin
Project (and save me from doing double work considerng Semaphores).
</p><p>
C++/Object Oriented I: A good idea would be to support not only Boopsi but
also the other GUI libraries being based (more or less) on Boopsi like MUI,
BGUI, Triton. Of course it might be a bit early to already discuss about
that but one never knows (it depends mainly on the Boopsi root class).
</p><p>
I see one problem coming up with Boopsi inside C++: Generally in C you create
f.e. a window object which contains also all Gadget objects. The objects are
usually created at this moment and not (like usually in C++) when the object
is defined (calling a construktor). You should consider well which way to
go here. I've personally not made too much thought in this matter up to now
(horrible english sentence ;-). Also hooks/TAGS etc. should be considered
early.

<h3>OOI - Object Oriented Intuition</h3>
<p>
As part of my studies I have to spend half a year in an enterprise. There
I have to develop a program under WinNT with MS Visual C++ and MFC. I'm
a beginner in programming the Amiga and so I would like to have an
equivalent class library on my Amiga because it's much easier to develop
own programs. But why only write a class library for Intuition? Classes
for ARexx- and MessagePorts, tasks, processes, threads (->your article),
file handling, network programming, graphics,... are neccesary too. I
know it would be much work but if there is a big response to your
article the project can be divided in parts
(network/exec/intuition/dos/graphics/...). A class library containing
all parts of the AmigaOS would be very nice and all parts will work
together becaused they are designed to do so!!!
I hope there will be much response!

<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>
I've just had a look at ExecBase -- and it looks impressive!
The articles are interesting and easy to read.. I'm looking forward to
issue 2! :)

<h3>EBase Is Cool</h3>
<p>
I'm reading ExecBase which I think is quite cool.
Unfortunately, I have to point out that loop.html is not included with
the archive on aminet. :(  Anyway, good work and I look forward to
future magazines, they're aimed at just the right level for me, assumes
a bit of knowledge but not ridiculously so.
</p><p>
Hopefully, it would help me in my construction of my own game!
