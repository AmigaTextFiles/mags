@{FG Shine}Welcome to @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 6th issue of @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}.

Only  4 days for Christmas. And 11 for the New Year. So first of all, I wish you
a merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!!!!

While  I  am  writing  this editorial (today is 20th December 1998) the time for
preordering  the 3dfx add-on for the @{B}Picasso IV@{UB} card is up. An add-on which will
be highly supported through @{B}Warp3D@{UB}.

At  this  moment, I don't know if the 500 needed preorders have been reached. If
this is not the case, it would be a real pity. And a missed oportunity.

If  there is something that every @{B}Amiga@{UB} owner want, it is the freedom to choose.
At  this  moment  only @{B}Phase 5@{UB} succeed in bringing real power to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. With
the  recent release of the @{B}Bvision PPC@{UB}, @{B}A1200@{UB} users have at least a graphic crad
designed  for them. And big boxes @{B}Amiga@{UB} users have got the @{B}Cyberstorm PPC@{UB} option
for a log time now.

But  @{B}Escena@{UB}  announced  last  month a @{B}G3@{UB} card for @{B}Zorro III@{UB} equipped @{B}Amiga@{UB}s. And
@{B}Village Tronic@{UB} announce the possibility of the add-on for the @{B}Picasso IV@{UB} card. I
though this will be my chance. Although the @{B}Escena@{UB} board could be a vapour card,
if it is finally released there won't be any excuse to not upgrade.

As  an  @{B}A4000@{UB}  user,  I  could  choose  between the @{B}Phase 5@{UB} solution (@{B}Cyberstorm
PPC@{UB}/@{B}Cybervision  PPC@{UB})  and  the  @{B}Escena@{UB}/@{B}Village  Tronic@{UB}  combo. Only if the 3Dfx
add-on  is  relased.  I risked, and I have preordered. And I want to win. But if
the 3Dfx is not developed, the only choice will be the @{B}PowerUp@{UB} card.

By  the  way,  once  the  @{B}Bvision  PPC@{UB}  has  been  released, a lot of people are
expecting  what  will  be the next move of @{B}Phase 5@{UB}. It is uncertain if they will
keep  developing  for  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}.  They  are dissapointed with the @{B}Amiga@{UB} users,
because some of them are only happy if they complain about everything.

Unlike  other  people  (I  am  thinking about some Sioux City based company ;)),
@{B}Phase  5@{UB}  deserve our eternal gratitude. They have made very good hardware. They
have brought the real power of the @{B}PPC@{UB} to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. And their graphic cards are
great. Thanks a lot, @{B}Phase 5@{UB}.

Whatever  they  left the @{B}Amiga@{UB} scene or not, I only hope one thing from them: to
remove  the  @{B}WarpOS@{UB}  incompatibility  from  the @{B}PowerUp@{UB} cards. As @{B}Warp3D@{UB} will be
@{B}WarpOS@{UB}  based (it is being developed by @{B}Haage&Partner@{UB}), it has to be possible to
run  a  @{B}PowerUp@{UB} program and a @{B}WarpUp@{UB} program at once, for the sake of the future
developments (@{B}Explorer 2260@{UB}, @{B}WipeOut 2097@{UB}, @{B}Phoenix@{UB}, etc.)

The  next  issue  of  @{B}AmiChannel  News@{UB}  will feature an special report about the
things  that  have  happenned in 1998. And we will try to guess what will happen
next year. But this is another story.

Remember to visit the @{B}SAUG@{UB} website, which is located in:

         @{B}http://www.saug.com/news.html@{UB}

or you can visit its mirrors located in:

@{B}A.C.T.@{UB} THOUGHTS AFTER END OF @{B}COMPUTER98@{UB}
---------------------------------------

Finally   things  seem  to  clear  up.  After  having  discussed  further  @{B}Amiga@{UB}
development  and  commercial oportunities on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} platform with a number of
hard- and software people @{B}A.C.T.@{UB} draws this conclusion:

@{B}Amiga  Inc@{UB}  does  not  seem to be interested in supporting the Real @{B}Amiga@{UB}. Their
continued  back-and-for  and  the announcements show a complete ignorance of the
remaining  market  and  an incredible insensibility for the needs of developers,
retailers,  press  people.  It  is not likely that anyone will be able to make a
fortune  out  of  Real @{B}Amiga@{UB} development or sales now. It is not true that @{B}Amiga
Inc@{UB} is in close discussion with developers - not a single developer known to the
partners   of   @{B}A.C.T.@{UB}  has  been  seriously  contacted.  Pretending  that  such
cooperation takes place is a slap in the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community's face.

Just  like  others  @{B}A.C.T.@{UB}  will  continue to produce, enhance and support their
current  product  range. It is not possible to invest in future projects though,
so four software products have been cancelled right after the fair and two major
hardware  projects will not be carried out (@{B}Festiva@{UB}, the High End Soundcard at a
price  BELOW  that  of  a  comparable  @{B}PC@{UB}  soundcard,  is  among  them). @{B}Prelude@{UB}
additions, software etc. will be continously developed and supported though - we
will  not  let  our  customers  down,  but we will not be able to grant the wide
service  and  support we have given to users all over the world in the future to
the same extend.

The disapointment about @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} being unable to show any real products (@{B}QNX@{UB} is
NOT  an  @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} product) convinced us that they do not have anything to offer
right now.

@{B}A.C.T.@{UB}   is   interested  in  cooperating  with  companies  having  products  in
development or actually on the market. We have a position to keep and extend, we
have  a  reputation  to  defend  and  we have families to feed. We would also be
interested  in  helping  a  company  that does not have anything to offer at the
moment  getting  started,  but  that company has to ask us - not vice versa. Our
knowledge in Digital Audio as well as driver programming, hardware expertise and
customer  relation  could be helpful - if this help would be accepted. We do not
beg for open ears.

@{B}Computer98@{UB}  set  an end point to an area of home computers. The @{B}Amiga@{UB} market can
not be revived and developers still active on this market will try their best to
support  the  users  that  haven't migrated - but it should be clear and kept in
mind that most of this support, even new products that pop up from time to time,
base on enthusiasm, not on market power.

What  about  the  future? @{B}QNX@{UB} offers a powerful kernel and interesting features,
yet it is a system among others and will have to prove that it can penetrate the
home computer market the same it does with the embedded system market.

@{B}Amiga  Inc@{UB}'s  future  plans  seem  to  target  to SetTop boxes, Dishwashers with
intelligence,  TVs that cook your coffee and take your children to bed. Although
this  may  be  a market in the future it is not a market at the moment or within
the  next  two years. We do not have the financial means to develop applications
for  two  years  without  selling  in  the  same time, so we cannot and will not
develop  for  the  "new"  @{B}Amiga OS@{UB} at the moment. We would have needed detailed,
usable  information  and  developer  support  NOW  -  we did not get it, so this
unknown,  indifferent  system  is  no choice. The way the owner company presents
itself  in  public is not destined to raise trust in their ability of support in
the future.

@{B}Amiga  OS  3.5@{UB}  seems to be dead. There is no information available about it, no
contract  has  been sent out, no discussion took place. We are not interested in
an  OS  that  does  not  even  support the feature nearly every modern @{B}Amiga@{UB} has
(through  Shareware)  nowadays.  A  Plus-Pack  is  of no interest to us. We have
withdrawn  our  offer  to  implement  @{B}ARTAS@{UB}  -  at  least based on the financial
agreement so far. @{B}ARTAS@{UB} will be made publically available but NOT a component of
an  @{B}Amiga  Inc  OS3.5@{UB}. This issue is subject to change depending on professional
offers from @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} (which we do not expect any more).

A last few words: any developer needing help is highly welcome to contact us. We
will  try our best to share our know how in software design and we will continue
to  support  and sponsor developers wherever possible. We are very interested in
participating in serious, professionally guided projects that might regain a bit
of market space.

@node not02 "DELFINA 1200 - NEW DSP AUDIO CARD FOR AMIGA 1200"

@{B}DELFINA 1200@{UB} - NEW DSP AUDIO CARD FOR @{B}AMIGA 1200@{UB}
------------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

@{I}1. TECH@{UI}

@{B}Delfina  1200@{UB} is based on @{B}Delfina Lite@{UB}, the most successful DSP card on @{B}Zorro-II
Amiga@{UB}s.  The  main difference between these two is that @{B}Delfina 1200@{UB} connects to
the internal clock port of @{B}A1200@{UB}. This way the @{B}PCMCIA@{UB} and expansion slots can be
used for other devices. The modern manufacturing allows a very low price: SRP is
$299.

@{B}Delfina  1200@{UB} is primarily a DSP audio card, and it is best suited for producing
and  recording  audio  with optional realtime effects. Effects can be applied on
any  sound  produced  by  @{B}Delfina@{UB}  or external source transparently, and all the
sounds produced by @{B}Delfina@{UB}-capable programs or external source can be mixed into
@{B}Delfina@{UB}'s  output.  @{B}Delfina  1200@{UB}  is  also  freely programmable for all general
computing tasks using the supplied compiler and libraries.

Features:
   * 37 MHz @{B}Motorola DSP56002@{UB} digital signal processor
       - 18.5 MIPS, upto 110 MOPS
       - 24 bit data bus (144 dB dynamic range)
   * 96kB (32kWords) SRAM
       - Zero-waitstate (12ns)
   * St-reo audio codec (Crystal CS4231A)
       - Sample frequencies upto 48 kHz at 16 bit
       - Three stereo inputs, one stereo output
       - All inputs can be mixed with Delfina's output
       - Full duplex recording and playback
       - One stereo RCA input
       - One stereo 3.5mm input with optional 20dB mic amplifier
       - One stereo RCA output
       - Internal connector for audio input from CD-ROM
       - Fully programmable using the supplied software
       - Registered version of @{B}SoundFX 3.50@{UB} software included

Requirements:
   * @{B}Amiga 1200@{UB} with an empty clock port
   * @{B}AmigaOS 2.04@{UB} or higher
   * about 5MB of hard disk space

@{I}2. SUPPORT@{UI}

@{B}Delfina  1200@{UB}  fully  supports  @{B}AHI@{UB},  the retargetable audio standard for @{B}Amiga@{UB}.
Number  of  @{B}AHI@{UB}  supporting  programs  is  steadily increasing. @{B}Delfina@{UB} also has
emulation for the @{B}Toccata@{UB} card.

In  addition  to  @{B}AHI@{UB}  standard,  @{B}Delfina  1200@{UB} can run multiple @{B}Delfina@{UB} and @{B}AHI@{UB}
programs  at  the same time, and various effects can be applied to any program's
output.  If multiple programs are producing sound, @{B}Delfina@{UB} will mix the outputs.
Only @{B}Delfina@{UB}'s DSP usage and internal memory set the limits.

Software supporting @{B}Delfina@{UB} includes:
   * @{B}Octamed SoundStudio@{UB}
   * @{B}AudioLab16@{UB} for @{B}Delfina@{UB}
   * @{B}SoundFX@{UB}
   * @{B}Digi Booster Pro@{UB}
   * @{B}Hippoplayer@{UB}
   * @{B}APlayer@{UB}
   * @{B}SinED@{UB}
   * @{B}Play 16@{UB}
   * @{B}ShapeShifter@{UB}
   * @{B}Fusion@{UB}
   * and many more.

@{B}Delfina 1200@{UB} system software includes:
   * @{B}AHI@{UB} (@{B}Audio Hardware Interface@{UB}) driver
       - Play&record multiple channel audio
       - @{B}AHI@{UB}  standard  allows  you  to  write software that works on other audio

@{B}DICE@{UB} DEVELOPERS WANTED
----------------------

@{I}FOR INMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

@{B}DICE@{UB}  is a freely distributable @{B}C@{UB} compiler environment for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} computer by
@{I}Matt  Dillon@{UI}.  It  started off life as shareware but became a commercial product
published  by @{B}Obvious Implementations Corporation@{UB}. With the decline in the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
market, @{I}Matt@{UI} released the source code to @{B}DICE@{UB} in 1997.

This is where @{I}Richard Drummond@{UI} came in.

@{I}Richard@{UI}  perceived  an  interest still remaining in the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community for @{B}DICE@{UB}
and  in  October  of this year he produced a cleaned-up release of @{B}DICE@{UB} based on
@{I}Matt@{UI}'s  source.  As  a  result @{I}Richard@{UI} received enthusiastic responses from many
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  users.  So, with @{I}Matt Dillon@{UI}'s help, he set up the @{B}DICE Development Group@{UB}
to continue work on @{B}DICE@{UB}.

The  @{B}Dice Development Group@{UB} would like any programmers wanting to help with @{B}DICE@{UB}
overhaul to join.

@{B}Dice@{UB} will be a totaly free compiler with source.

New features:
  * Compiler optimisations
  * @{B}PPC@{UB}/@{B}C++@{UB}
  * Your suggestions.

JUST AN ICKLE SURVEY
--------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Hi  folks.  As a small effort to see what requirements @{B}FUBAR@{UB} should need, I need
to  know  what  basic  specifications  your  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  has. Please answer these few
questions so I know what I'm working with.

If you're replied to this on a mailing list, don't reply to it again :).

8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>--

  * What  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  type do you have? (e.g. @{B}A1200@{UB}/@{B}A4000@{UB}/@{B}A3000@{UB} - not bothered if its
    towered or not)
  * Which processor do you have (include any @{B}PPC@{UB} chip)?
  * How much RAM does your @{B}Amiga@{UB} have? (in MB please - and just Fast RAM)
  * Do  you  have  a  graphics  card, if so what type and what driver do you use
    (@{B}Picasso96@{UB}/@{B}CGFX@{UB})?
  * What  speed  CD-ROM  do  you  have  (e.g.  2x,  8x..),  and if you know, the
    transfer rate? IDE/SCSI?
  * What TCP/IP stack do you use?

8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>-- 8>--

Six simple questions :) Just mail me direct (@{I}oondy@bigfoot.com@{UI})

The  current  minimum  requirements for @{B}FUBAR@{UB} will be @{B}020@{UB}, @{B}AGA@{UB} or graphics card,
8MB  Fast,  and  a  non-descript  CD-ROM.    I'd  like  to  increase  the memory
requirements so it can be more graphics rich but I don't know what people have -
hence the aim of this survey.

BTW, I am happy to support @{B}68k@{UB} _and_ @{B}PPC@{UB} for @{B}FUBAR@{UB} - just in case you wondered.

Cheers :)

@{B}GENETIC SPECIES@{UB} & NETWORK SUPPORT?
----------------------------------

@{I}FOR INMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

We  know  many  people  were looking forward to the internet play add-on and the
World  Creation  Kit. These original planned addons would without doubt give the
game a hole new dimension.

The  main  problem  in introducing network support in @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} is that we
currently  have  no  members  in  our  team  that's  familiar  with fast network
programming. Still we managed to make network support in @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} shortly
after  the release of the game a few months ago. But we where not satisfied with
the  result at all as it was far too slow - resulting in destroying the gameplay
completely  when  playing  in  multiplayer  mode.  As  stated before all current
development  has  been  halted,  still  we want to make a final effort in making
network  support  a reality with the help from the skilled @{B}Amiga@{UB} community - YES
YOU!

Please  contact  @{I}Martin  Halberg@{UI}  -  @{B}Marble Eyes Development@{UB} if you think you're
skilled enough to help us making fast network support a reality.

Spread the word!

Regards

The @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} Team.

-----------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Hi!

I  released  @{B}mpega-WarpUP.lha@{UB} today. It works great. And is even faster now than
the "final" version which i already copied to some people by email (this version
still contained debugging code which i removed now...).

Ah,   i  noticed,  i  somehow  screwed  up  the  @{B}mpega@{UB}  int-version.  But  the
float-version  has  better  quality  anyways, and the @{B}PPC@{UB} is fast enough for it.
I'll do a fixed version of the int-version next release, though (the int-version
is faster, but the quality of the float version is much better)

@{B}TMLG@{UB},  @{B}SongPlayer@{UB}, @{B}AmigaAMP 68k@{UB} and @{B}AMPlifier@{UB} were tested up to now with it, and
all work great :)

@{B}RAMJAM CONSULTANTS@{UB} HAVE ABANDONED THE @{B}AMIGA OPERA@{UB} PORT
------------------------------------------------------

@{B}Amiga  Inc.@{UB}  is  doing  all  their  best to ruin all the developments for the so
called  @{B}Amiga@{UB} Classic. The last example comes from @{B}RamJam Consultants@{UB} which were
doing  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  port of the @{B}Opera@{UB} browser. This is the info straight from the
Team.

                ----------------------------------------
Unfortunately the Cologne show did not provide the hoped for boost for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
Classic  market, and @{B}Ramjam Consultants@{UB} have therefore abandoned the @{B}Amiga Opera@{UB}
port.

Previous offers of support from @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} appear to have been withdrawn, and the
future  for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Classic market now seems even more bleak than at any other
time.

While the big public news from Cologne is undoubtably good for the future of the
new generation of @{B}Amiga@{UB}s expected to be released sometime during the year 2000 -
the  new  kernel  will  be  @{B}Neutrino@{UB}  from  @{B}QNX Software Systems Ltd@{UB} - a lot has
happened  out of the public eye to cause most remaining @{B}Amiga@{UB} Classic developers
to lose confidence.

@{I}PRESS RELEASE@{UI}

Do  you  want  to  work in a semi-professional game development company? Are you
inventive, determined and skillful?

We  are  looking to set up a 3rd development team within @{B}Pagan@{UB} to work on a 3rd,
exciting  project. You will be a part of the @{B}Pagan@{UB} development group and as such

prospective  @{B}AMIGA@{UB}  publishing houses. Currently there is NO commercial contract
for  this  game or offer of any money. The concept is for @{B}Pagan@{UB} to sell the game
via  the  demo to a publishing company then with a contract signed, profits from
sales   split   between   the   coding  team  who  produced  the  demo.  An  NDA
(Non-Disclosure Agreement) and Development contact with @{B}Pagan@{UB} will exist for the
demo.

VACANCIES

Project  Manager:  We  are  looking for a well organised and dedicated person to
lead a team of designers, coders, graphicians and audio people. You must be able
to  communicate  well,  lead  a group that will be split up around the world and
deliver  regular  reports to Team Leaders at @{B}Pagan@{UB}. You will also arrange weekly
meetings  with the development team (via IRC) to keep the project up-to-date and
to  solve any problems/make decisions on development. A knowledge in programming
or  design  is  a bonus. The candidate must process the ability to see a project
from  beginning  to  end with determination and foresight to adapt and change to
any  problems  that  may arise during development. The ability to be resourceful
and able to problem solve is essential.

Lead Coder: We require a lead coder to design and implement a game engine in any
language,  @{B}Assembler@{UB}, @{B}C@{UB}, @{B}C++@{UB} or @{B}Blitz@{UB}. The ability to problem solve and adapt to
change/new ideas essential. Knowledge of @{B}C2P@{UB}, @{B}Workbench@{UB}, @{B}RTG@{UB} (gfx cards) and @{B}AHI@{UB}
essential. @{B}PPC@{UB} coding experience a bonus and desirable.

@{B}3DFX@{UB} FOR @{B}AMIGA@{UB}: TO BE OR NOT TO BE
----------------------------------

From: @{I}sam jordan@{UI} @{I}jordsamo@htlchur.ch@{UI}@{UI}

Hi

This  newsletter  is  intended  to  be  written for all those @{B}AMIGA@{UB} users, which
really  care  for  the future of the @{B}AMIGA@{UB}, especially concerning games. I would
like to show anyone what we can expect in future, what will be possible and what
the  @{B}AMIGA@{UB}  users themselves have to contribute to make all this possible. Now a
very  important  decision  is  to  be  done,  which  will  influence  the future
development  of  @{B}AMIGA@{UB}  games, and how the decision will look like, depends very
much on the @{B}AMIGA@{UB} users themselves.

In  the  past  weeks  there  were  a  lot of discussions about the @{B}Villagetronic@{UB}
project,  which  is supposed to bring the @{B}Voodoo1@{UB} hardware for @{B}AMIGA@{UB}. I will now
explain,  what  this  project means for the potential customers and what it will
mean for the @{B}AMIGA@{UB} as a whole.

First,  for  all  those, who spreaded wrong information:@{B}Villagetronic@{UB} still need
pre-orders! The decision about the project will be done in a few weeks, so there
is  not  much time left. If they don't get the expected 500 preorders, they will
definitely  cancel  the  project.  Pre-orders  can  be done on the @{B}villagetronic@{UB}
websites.

I'm  sure  that  there are a lot of people around, which might be interested for
such  a  hardware,  but which fear, that this hardware will become as useless as
all  other  3D  graphics board up to now. The reason for this lack of supporting
software  were the missing 3D drivers (a situation which is unthinkable on other
platforms,  where the chip manufacturers themselves provide appropriate drivers,
most often with support for @{B}Direct3D@{UB} and @{B}OpenGL@{UB}).

The  same  is now coming for the @{B}AMIGA@{UB}, the @{B}Warp3D@{UB} driver system intends to give
the  programmers  an instrument in their hands to be able to use the advanced 3D
features.  Its  API  is  hardware-independent,  so  that any 3D hardware will be
supported  for @{B}AMIGA@{UB}. The @{B}Virge@{UB} driver is done, the @{B}Permedia2@{UB} driver in work and
any  other  driver will be written, so that every new 3D hardware will come with
complete  drivers  and software using them (and the drivers will be there at the
first  release  of  the  hardware,  not  months  or even years later!). The @{B}3dfx@{UB}
hardware will be definitely supported by @{B}Warp3D@{UB}.

With  the  first  release  of  @{B}Warp3D@{UB} (coming this or next week) there will be a
release  of  the  first game supporting @{B}Warp3D@{UB}: @{B}ADescent@{UB}. This game demonstrates
the  features  and performance of 3D hardware and shows that it is even possible
to  play  games  fast  with  fast @{B}68K@{UB} processors. The difference between the new
@{B}Warp3D-Descent@{UB} version and the previous version with @{B}Virge@{UB} support (through some
unfinished beta drivers) are:
   * The  @{B}W3D@{UB}  version supports any 3D hardware, while the old one only supports
     the @{B}Virge@{UB}
   * The  @{B}W3D@{UB}  version  runs  with  @{B}P96@{UB}  and  with  @{B}CGFX@{UB}, while the old one only
     supports @{B}CGFX@{UB}
   * The  @{B}W3D@{UB}  version has an extremly better graphics quality than the old one,
     because these old drivers were unfinished and didn't support many features,
     which  improve  the graphics quality a lot. The @{B}W3D@{UB} version provides on the
     @{B}Virge@{UB}  bilinear  filtering, mipmapping, trilinear filtering and fogging for
     top graphics quality.
   * The  @{B}W3D@{UB}  version  runs  much  faster then the old version, since the @{B}Virge@{UB}
     driver  for @{B}W3D@{UB} was optimized like hell (core parts of the setup stage were
     written  in  @{B}ASM@{UB}  for both CPU's). While @{B}Descent@{UB} is only playable nicely in
     resolutions  up  to 320*400*15 on the @{B}Virge@{UB}, it will be possible to play it
     in  800*600*15  on  a  @{B}Voodoo1@{UB}  card  at nice frame rate (and @{B}Descent@{UB} looks
     incredible at that resolution!)

This  feature  list  should  show,  what  it  means to have hardware-independent
drivers.  You  can  develop  a  software today and it will work with hardware of
tomorrow, without any single change of code.

Meanwhile  there  are  a  lot of developers which have access to the beta files,
which  partially  work for commercial game projects, so that we can expect a lot
of  applications  which support 3D hardware. The game company @{B}Digital Images@{UB} has
announced  support  for  @{B}Warp3D@{UB}  and  @{B}WarpUp@{UB}  and  they have some promising game
projects.  A  list  of those projects will be available on the 3DWorld web sites
soon.

As we all know, there were @{B}PC@{UB} games around which supported @{B}OpenGL@{UB} and achieved a
fantastic  graphics  quality, like @{B}Quake2@{UB}. There is a slight chance to get games
like  @{B}Quake2@{UB} for @{B}AMIGA@{UB}, but it is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to have *TOP* 3D hardware
available  to  run  such  games  fast enough. The @{B}Virge@{UB} has no chance to achieve
that,  while  the  @{B}Permedia2@{UB}  should give acceptable frame rates and the @{B}Voodoo1@{UB}
will fly.

@{B}OpenGL@{UB}  with  3D  hardware support is also coming to the @{B}AMIGA@{UB}. At the same time
with  @{B}Warp3D@{UB}  there  will  be  the  release  of @{B}StormMesa 3.0@{UB}, which supports 3D
hardware through @{B}Warp3D@{UB}. I demonstrated this at cologne, but the performance was
even improved very much meanwhile, through many optimizations. I spend very much
time  to  get  out  the  max.  of  @{B}OpenGL@{UB}  and 3D-hardware (by rewriting tons of
functions  to  ASM for both CPU's) and the results are very impressive even with
the @{B}Virge@{UB}.

@{B}StormMesa  3.0@{UB}  and  @{B}Warp3D@{UB} will be available for @{B}68K@{UB} and @{B}PPC@{UB}/@{B}WarpUp@{UB}, so that it
would  be  possible  to  play games like @{B}Quake2@{UB} in high resolutions at very high
speed.  Even  the @{B}Virge@{UB} accelerates those demos by several factors, so that real
good hardware can cause real miracles.

But  all  this  requires,  that  there  are  enough  users around with *FAST* 3D
hardware.  Games  like @{B}Quake2@{UB} and @{B}Wipeout@{UB} really need 3D hardware to run nicely,
so  all  these projects are in real danger, if there is not enough fast hardware
around.  Running an @{B}OpenGL@{UB} game on a plain @{B}PPC@{UB} without 3D hardware support means
the  same  as  playing  @{B}Quake1@{UB}  on  a  @{B}68040@{UB}  processor.  It is useless! And the
companies  will  also  come  to this conclusion, so they need the perspective to
sell enough copies of the game.

Please  note,  that  it is completely impossible to run 3D games on the @{B}AMIGA@{UB} in
high  resolutions  at high speed, if there is no 3D hardware present. To display
the  graphics  data,  it  has  to be transferred through the @{B}Z3@{UB} resp. @{B}CVPPC@{UB} bus,
which  is  dead  slow. The @{B}PowerPC@{UB} is really useless for these high resolutions.
The 3D hardware are the only chance to bypass this bottleneck.

To  come  to  the initial point: I strongly believe that the decision to make or
not to make the hardware has a *major* influence to the future game market. Many
promising  game  projects  are  announced, but only few of them will actually be
released,  because  the  other  ones  need more power than there actually is (in
terms of sold 3D graphics boards)

Just a question to all those people, which would like to buy those new announced
@{B}PPC@{UB}  boards:  what  serious 3D accelerator do you want to buy? There is a simple
answer:  there  is none. Except if the @{B}3DFX@{UB} overdrive is released. Let us have a
look at the other 3D chips available:
  * @{B}Virge@{UB}:  very  old,  very  weak  compared to modern 3D chips, only usable for
    custom engines and for low resolutions. Too weak for serious @{B}OpenGL@{UB} (serious
    means beeing able to achieve a good frame rate for complex applications like
    those games)
  * @{B}Permedia2@{UB}:  newer  than  the  @{B}Virge@{UB},  much faster, but restricted to be used
    together  with  the  @{B}Phase5@{UB} hardware (please forget the idea, that those new
    boards  will provide the @{B}CVPPC@{UB} slot, this won't be the case). And for those,
    which  might have a look at the crazy idea to run one of those @{B}Escena@{UB} boards
    in  parallel  to the @{B}CyberVisionPPC@{UB}: The Escena board will probably not have
    access  to  the @{B}CVPPC@{UB}, so the hardware could only be accessed via the @{B}68K@{UB} by
    trapping  the  accesses  and processing appropriate exception handlers. This
    means:  major  slowdown,  especially for 3D operations (it takes at least 10
    register  accesses  for  one  single triangle, and modern games draw several
    thousands of them per frame).

Now  it's  up  to  those  users,  which  didn't decide yet to pre-order the @{B}3dfx@{UB}
overdrive,  to do it *NOW*, because a few weeks later it will be too late (Note:
The  period  for  the pre-ordering will finnish on December, 20th). The hardware
will  be  released  together  with  complete  drivers, with @{B}OpenGL@{UB} support, with
several  hundreds  of @{B}OpenGL@{UB} demos, together with @{B}Descent@{UB} (executable only), and
all  game projects, which are now in the making with @{B}W3D@{UB} support, will instantly
work with the hardware.

To  all  others, which won't buy it because they don't own a @{B}PIV@{UB} or because they
already  have  another  accelerator:  please  talk  with  people  which might be
interested  in  this  hardware, tell them what I have written here. Also address
people  which  don't  have internet access, spread this message. All users which
pre-order  a  hardware  will get a top hardware together with tons of supporting
software  and  they  will  help  the  @{B}AMIGA@{UB}  very much, since they give the game
developers the sign, that it is really worth to support this technology.

Please  spread  this  message, display them everywhere, send it to every mailing
list,  talk about it, do all you can to support this fantastic project! Convinve
the  people  to  pre-order the hardware! By supporting the 3DFX project, you are
also  supporting  the  @{B}Warp3D@{UB} team, which spend incredible much time to give the
@{B}AMIGA@{UB} the possibility to run games at never-seen speed, and all that for free.

If you have some questions addressed to myself, then please write them to one of
the  eMail  addresses  below.  You  can  also  ask  all  members of the @{B}W3D@{UB} team
(@{I}Hans-Joerg@{UI} and @{I}Thomas Frieden@{UI}, and myself).

To be or not to be, that's now the question.

bye

--------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:@{UI}

Free for Re-Publication

Australia - December 1998

Contact/Reply to: @{I}Basil Flinter@{UI} @{I}flinter@tpg.com.au@{UI}

It  is  with  pleasure  that we announce that @{I}Petro Tyschtschenko@{UI}, head of @{B}Amiga
International@{UB}, will be visiting Australia in January 1999.

As  this  will  be  the  first  visit  to  Australia by any @{B}AMIGA@{UB} official since
@{B}Commodore@{UB}'s  demise  in  1994,  @{I}Petro Tyschtschenko@{UI} is keen to meet with as many
members of the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community as he can during his trip.

There  will  be  an  opportunity to meet Mr @{I}Tyschtschenko@{UI} in Perth on Saturday 9
January 1999, and at two meetings proposed for the following weekend in Sydney.

For  those  with  a  commercial  interest  in  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s  future in Australia
(Australasia), there will be a business meeting in Sydney on Friday 15 January.

And  depending on the support shown, a daytime function (lunch will be optional)
is proposed for the general public on Saturday, 16 January.

Persons  wishing to meet @{I}Petro Tyschtschenko@{UI} should send an email to the contact
address  given  above,  putting:  `@{I}Petro@{UI}  Visit  Perth' or `@{I}Petro@{UI} Visit Business
Sydney'  or  `@{I}Petro@{UI}  Visit  General  Sydney'  as the Subject, according to which
meeting they would like to attend.

Then,  in  the  body  of the email, they should give some background information
about themselves, as well as any comments that they may care to make relating to
the @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s future in Australasia.

Even  if you can't attend, please email us with your comments. (In this case put
`@{I}Petro@{UI} Visit Comment Only' as the Subject).

Australia once had a vibrant @{B}Amiga@{UB} community.

An  overwhelming response to this posting will indicate that the @{B}Amiga@{UB} still has
a  future  in Australasia, and will send a strong message to @{I}Petro Tyschtschenko@{UI}
and @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} that they should do something about it.

@{B}FAIRBROTHERS, INC.@{UB} ANNOUNCES CLEARANCE SPECIAL
----------------------------------------------

@{I}Press Release@{UI}:

Audio Gallery for $9.95.

@{B}Audio  Gallery@{UB}  is available in English (ESL), German, Spanish, French, Italian,
Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
English/Romance  is  for  Spanish,  French,  German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch,
Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish and Polish speakers.
English/Oriental is for Japanese, Korean and Chinese speakers.

I  am  trying  to clear out the basement of about 900 boxes of @{B}Audio Gallery 1.0@{UB}
(yes,  I  am  actually  working on a Version 2.0 of @{B}Audio Gallery@{UB} for the @{B}Amiga@{UB},
with  improved  graphics, some 3-D stuff, better sound quality, music, etc. (all
the things that the @{B}PC@{UB} copied from us)).

@{B}Audio  Gallery@{UB},  if  you  don't  remember, was the world's first talking picture
dictionary  (1989)  using  digitized  speech  and  graphics, thanks to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
technology.  Thousands  of  these were sold at prices ranging up to $129.95 each
(unfortunately,  @{B}Fairbrothers@{UB}  invested  in  @{B}Commodore@{UB}  stock), but now they are
being offered for $9.95 each.

Available  on  CD-ROM (CD + diskette) or Diskette (7-8 diskettes), @{B}Audio Gallery@{UB}
is  a  talking  picture  dictionary,  a  good introduction to learning a foreign
language,  and  a  vocabulary  builder. @{B}Audio Gallery@{UB} uses the "Duden" method of
teaching  native  language that has been used for several decades in Germany and
Japan.  The  "Duden"  or picture dictionary, lays a good learning foundation for
schoolchildren,   and   is   a   reflection   of   how  these  countries  became
technologically advanced.

@{B}Audio Gallery@{UB} features digitized speech by native speakers. Spanish is done by a
native  Bolivian,  Chinese is the Mandarin dialect (Taiwanese accent), French is
Parisian-accented.

@{B}Audio  Gallery@{UB}  includes  about  thirty  colorful,  everyday  scenes. Each scene
includes  about  thirty  key words - numbered objects in the Scene. Click on the
object  to  hear  its pronunciation and see the written form in both English and
the foreign language.

Scenes  include:  Weather,  Supermarket,  Basic  Expressions,  Numbers, Clothes,
Living Room, Restaurant, Around the Town, and many others.

For  reference,  @{B}Audio Gallery@{UB} includes an on-line dictionary; quizzes test your
progress. A grammar manual is included, and for Chinese and Spanish, a workbook.

@{B}Audio  Gallery@{UB}  is  available  in  Korean,  Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish,
German, French, English, Italian, and Portuguese.

The  updated English-Romance version speaks in English and shows translations in
Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, French, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Finnish,
Polish,  Russian, Swedish and Indonesian. The English-Oriental version speaks in
English  and  translates  into  Japanese  or Chinese. The English-Korean version
speaks in English and shows translations in English and Korean.

Check it out at @{B}http://www.fairbrothers.com/ag.htm@{UB}

Hope @{B}Gateway@{UB}/@{B}AI@{UB} comes through - 1999 will be the year of the "Wonder" @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

SECURITY ADVISORY FOR @{B}AMIGA@{UB} INTERNET USERS
------------------------------------------

By @{B}Nordic Global Inc.@{UB}, 12/05/98, @{I}for immediate release@{UI}

During  the  first  week  of  December  a  list  of  over 700 stolen user names,
passwords  and  host  names  of Internet service providers was circulated in the
"scene" and posted in several places, including Usenet. Most public postings did
not  include  the passwords, but they ARE present in the original list, i.e. the
list DOES exist, and presents a real threat to users on the list.

Anyone  in  possession  of  the  list  can use entries on the list to break into
Internet  accounts  of  corresponding  users,  unless  those users changed their
passwords in the meantime. In other words: if YOU appear on the list then anyone
who  has that list can break into YOUR Internet account, until/unless you change
your password.

Some  of  the  entries  on  the list were obtained using "normal" means, i.e. by
breaking into ISP routers or exploiting known @{B}Unix@{UB} or @{B}NT@{UB} system vulnerabilities.
Things like that happen all the time, and are difficult to prevent.

However  many  entries  on the list were obtained using a different mechanism: a
"Trojan"  distributed  to  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  users,  that secretely spied username/password
information  out,  and  sent them to an Internet account, where that information
was gathered by pirates.

After  a  lot of false and sometimes slanderous rumors how that secret mechanism
works  and  which  program is to blame, a joint effort by @{B}Nordic Global Inc.@{UB} and
several  helpful  users,  who  wish  to  stay  anonymous, finally determined the
precise way the passwords were gathered:

  * A  pirate  group  spread  a  fake version of "datatypes.library" via @{B}Aminet@{UB}.
    That  version has a version number of either @{B}45.4@{UB} or @{B}45.5@{UB} (depending on when
    and  how you check the version), and a file size of 32748 bytes. The library
    contains  a  concealed  Trojan  that  reads usernames and passwords from the
    Internet  settings  files  on  your  harddisk,  and sends them by email to a
    pirate  group,  who  then  collects  that  information  and enters it into a
    database.
  * If  you  have  that  version  of "datatypes.library" installed, then you are
    strongly advised to delete it, and to replace it with one of the legitimite,
    safe versions of datatypes.library, e.g. one of
        - 39.11 (from @{B}Workbench@{UB} disks)
        - 40.6 (from @{B}Workbench@{UB} disks)
        - 45.3 (from @{B}Aminet@{UB})
        - 45.4 (from @{B}Aminet@{UB})
  * If  you  install  @{B}45.4@{UB} then make sure the file size is 27780 bytes. If it is
    32748  bytes then it is actually the dangerous, fake version @{B}45.5@{UB}, reporting
    a wrong version number, not the "real" version @{B}45.4@{UB}.
  * After  that  you  should  physically  switch  off your computer, wait for 30
    seconds, and switch it on again, just in case.
  * Once  you  have  done  that, log into your Internet provider and change your
    password.  If you have previously already changed your password, but did not
    replace  the  fake  library, then you should change your password again now,
    because  your  account  information  may  have been compromised again in the
    meantime.

It is not known for sure yet who the author of that fake library and "collector"
of  the  generated  stolen  accounts is, but an investigation is underway. Also,
there  are  very  strong, yet so far unconfirmed, indications (including witness
statements by informants) that the infamous pirate group "@{B}Digital Corruption@{UB}" is
to blame for this.

If  that turned out to be true then it would only prove once again that software
written  or distributed by or in cooperation with pirate organizations cannot be
trusted, and may have harmful secret side effects.

If  you  are  wondering  why  it  is  @{B}Nordic  Global  Inc.@{UB}  who  are making this
announcement: the original password list that was distributed contains a comment
in  obscene  language  that  those  passwords  were  obtained through an alleged
"backdoor in @{B}Miami@{UB}"

Do  not be fooled by that. That claim is an obvious lie, a slanderous accusation
attempting  to  tarnish  the reputation of @{B}Miami@{UB} and @{B}Nordic Global Inc.@{UB}, without
any  factual  basis. @{B}Amiga@{UB} pirate groups, in particular @{B}Digital Corruption@{UB}, have
been  targetting  @{B}Nordic  Global  Inc.@{UB} with accusations like that for quite some
time because of our strong public stand against piracy.

@{B}Miami@{UB}  does not have any "backdoors", and could not be used, and was not used to
compile  the  list,  or  to  provide  any information that appeared on the list.
Nevertheless  many  users  and  unfortunately  even  some developers and dealers
spread  the  false rumor that @{B}Miami@{UB} is "dangerous" in any way. This is obviously
not the case.

We  felt  it  necessary  to  try  and  find out the truth about how the list was
compiled,  not only to document the safety of @{B}Miami@{UB}, but also to be able to give
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  users  the  information  they need to react to this threat and to prevent
further damage.

For   more   information   on   this   attack   please   visit   our   web  site
"@{B}http://www.nordicglobal.com/@{UB}", in particular the "News" section.

@{B}AKJFIF WARPUP@{UB}/@{B}WARPOS@{UB} (@{B}PPC@{UB}) INFORMATION
--------------------------------------

@{I}FOR INMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Hi,

this is a small announcement regarding @{B}WOS@{UB} (@{B}WarpUp@{UB}/@{B}WarpOS PPC@{UB}) support within my
@{B}Amiga@{UB}/@{B}PPC@{UB} products.

Several  people  did  request this, and even promised to register their software
WHEN this would be done.

Ok, it's done now - to some degree.

There's now an @{B}EGCS@{UB}-based version of a plugin for "akJFIF.datatype".

To be installed as follows:

      LoadElfWos              C:
      akJFIF.wos              sys:classes/datatypes
      akJFIF.datatype.040     sys:classes/datatypes/akJFIF.datatype

Note, that "akJFIF.ppc" still should to be left where it is - the ".wos" version
only  will  be used, if "powerpc-lib V14+" is found (and thus "ppc.library" will
be disabled, anyway).

Otherwise  "ppc.library"  and  the  ".ppc"  plugin will be used. One can use the
"NOPPC" option to switch either one off.

This perhaps is the first @{B}PPC@{UB}/@{B}WOS@{UB} "mixed" binary ;)

I'll  soon  supply this "patch" on my homepage - in the meantime you can already
spread it, if you like (@{B}PPC@{UB} mailing list or so).

Important:
From  the  feedback  on  this @{B}WOS@{UB} plugin for @{B}akJFIF@{UB} it will depend, whether I'll
port  the other datatypes plus my @{B}SView PPC@{UB} modules as well. So, please register
NOW - or never.

@node not32 "THE WORLD FOUNDRY LEAVE VULCAN SOFTWARE"

@{B}THE WORLD FOUNDRY@{UB} LEAVE @{B}VULCAN SOFTWARE@{UB}
---------------------------------------

@{B}The World Foundry@{UB} - @{I}Official Press Release@{UI} - 16th December 1998

Today it has been confirmed that our company has parted from @{B}Vulcan Software@{UB} and
@{B}Vulcan@{UB}  will not be publishing @{B}Explorer 2260@{UB} for the @{B}Amiga PPC@{UB}. This is entirely
our own decision and has not been in anyway forced by @{B}Vulcan@{UB}.

Here is a short FAQ to cover most of the questions that we expect to be asked.

@{I}@{B}Q.@{UB} What were the reasons for @{B}TWF@{UB} to leave @{B}Vulcan@{UB} ? @{UI}
@{B}A.@{UB}  We  have  different opinions on the current market and community, as well as
different  plans  for  the  future. This is an amicable split and we wish @{B}Vulcan@{UB}
well with their future @{B}PC@{UB} software titles.

@{I}@{B}Q.@{UB} What effect will this have on @{B}Explorer2260@{UB} for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} ?@{UI}
@{B}A.@{UB} None whatsoever. Development of @{B}Explorer2260 PPC@{UB} and the @{B}Explorer Universe@{UB} is
continuing  as  normal  and  will  continue  till the title is finished. We have
updated the game specifications last week to state that we would be using @{B}Warp3D@{UB}
to provide 3D hardware accelerated performance.

@{I}@{B}Q.@{UB} I think @{B}Explorer@{UB} is vapour, why should I care ?@{UI}
@{B}A.@{UB}  Fair enough. If you want to believe that, it's your opinion. It's wrong, but
it's  yours.  I'm  sure  that  the 18 people working on it in various capacities
would agree with you whole heartedly.

@{I}@{B}Q.@{UB}  You're  going  to  cancel  the  title  eventually anyway and do a @{B}PC@{UB} version
instead, aren't you ?@{UI}
@{B}A.@{UB}  Absolutely  not.  If  we  had  any plans to do that we would not have parted
company with @{B}Vulcan@{UB}.

@{I}@{B}Q.@{UB} When will we see a demo/screenshots ?@{UI}
@{B}A.@{UB} The first images of the graphic engine should be seen in the first quarter of
1999. We apologies for no pictures of the game before this (bar the renders used
of  ship  designs  and  aliens in our game encyclopedia) but the code for the 3D
engine  is  in  no state to be shown unless people care for sexy pictures of the
code.

@{I}@{B}Q.@{UB} When is it due to be finished ?@{UI}
@{B}A.@{UB}  We  will try and aim for a 3rd quarter release although this could well fall
back into the 4th quarter.

@{I}@{B}Q.@{UB} How will @{B}Explorer@{UB} be published now ?@{UI}
@{B}A.@{UB} That will be determined closer to it's completion.

     @{I}Ed Collins@{UI} - @{B}Explorer Universe@{UB} Manager

@node not34 "IAT MANUFACTURING TO DEVELOP AN AMIGA PARALLEL PROCESSING SYSTEM"

@{B}IAT MANUFACTURING@{UB} TO DEVELOP AN @{B}AMIGA@{UB} PARALLEL PROCESSING SYSTEM
----------------------------------------------------------------

Issued By: @{B}IAT Manufacturing@{UB}

This information is provided primarily for developers in the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community and
contains  information  on a product which is still very much under  development.
Any  specifications remain subject to change. This project has been underway for
a  number  of  months  and  is  now approaching hardware completion. The @{B}Impulse
Multiprocessing@{UB}  system  is  being  developed  jointly  by @{B}IAT Manufacturing@{UB} and
@{B}Alternate Approach@{UB}. @{B}Alternate Approach@{UB} are  handling the development of a custom
Micro-OS  which  will  enable transparent  integration with @{B}Amiga OS@{UB}® which does
not  currently support multiple  processors. @{B}IAT Manufacturing@{UB} is developing the
system  hardware  based    around @{B}Motorola@{UB}'s @{B}Coldfire@{UB} Family of Microprocessors.
Development of the Operating System component is underway.

@{I}Project Aims@{UI}

  * To provide a low cost alternative to other acceleration systems.
  * Provide instruction sets similar to the @{B}68k@{UB}.
  * Provide  a system which can be upgraded in the future whilst maintaining any
    existing functionality in addition to the upgrade.

@{I}Advantages of @{B}Impulse@{UB}@{UI}

 *  MODULAR system allows low cost production & easy upgrades
 *  Single  Board  production  unit  with  modular interface boards for specific
    machines,  e.g.,  you  install an impulse card on an @{B}A1200@{UB}, when you upgrade
    you only need to change the interface board, not the whole system.
 *  The  system  is  ideally  suited  to  a  truly multitasking environment, the
    individual  processors  can  work on different tasks; reducing the number of
    context switches, interrupts from expansion cards could also be serviced via
    external request pins.

@{I}Specifications@{UI}

These  specifications  are  preliminary,  but are unlikely to change in the near
future. The first board designs utilise the @{B}MCF5307@{UB} processors working in tandem
with  a  @{B}68k@{UB},  all  processors  are  autonomous  (this  is  not  a  co-processor
arrangement).  The  product  makes full use of multiple buses to minimise use of
the  main  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  bus  (@{B}IMultibus@{UB}© technology). If this product is successful we
plan  to  move  towards @{B}V4 Coldfire@{UB}® during 1999 with low cost 600MIPS solutions
(and  no  @{B}68k@{UB}'s in sight). Theoretically there is also no reason why the @{B}Impulse@{UB}
system  could not function alongside a @{B}PPC@{UB} card. Why @{B}Coldfire@{UB}? We have chosen to
use  the @{B}ColdFire@{UB} range for a number of reasons, the most obvious being the fact
that  it is highly compatible with @{B}68k@{UB} code. The @{B}ColdFire@{UB} range has recently had
frequent  updates  and  has  a  development roadmap taking it well into the next
millennium.  Because  the @{B}CF@{UB} is Variable-length @{B}RISC@{UB} instructions are denser and
less  memory  is required to run the same applications also the @{B}CF@{UB} does more per
MIP  than conventional @{B}RISC@{UB}. The Fact that the @{B}ColdFire@{UB} range is low cost allows
us  to  build  multiple  processor  systems  which  are  more  responsive than a
conventional  single  processor  setup.  The  @{B}MCF5307@{UB} used in our first units is
typical   of   the  @{B}ColdFire@{UB}  architecture  with  each  device  having  on-board
peripherals  and  memory  as  well  as  large  caches. @{B}DSP@{UB} functionality is also
introduced by the @{B}ColdFire MAC@{UB} (multiply-accumulate) unit.

@{I}Planned specification includes:@{UI}

   * Two @{B}MCF5307@{UB} processors (70 MIPS each) + @{B}68k@{UB} processor
   * Two Fully functional FPU's
   * 8 megabit SRAM (2-clock - 12ns access time)
   * Three RS232 type serial ports
   * M-bus Support (Compatibility with I2C standard)
   * Custom  Expansion  Bus  with  access  to  programmable  chip  selects & DMA
     controller
   * Standard DRAM controllers
   * 4 General-Purpose Timers The Future?

The  @{B}ColdFire@{UB}  range  is well suited to use in a multimedia environment; this is
shown  by the wealth of available third party companion IC's available including
Ethernet  and @{B}PCI@{UB} interfaces. @{B}IAT Manufacturing@{UB} plans to continue development of
the  @{B}Impulse@{UB} range to provide low cost and customisable acceleration options for
the  future.  @{B}Impulse@{UB}  delivers our unique @{B}IBus@{UB}© interface which provides a very
low  cost  solution  for  third  party peripheral products giving access to Chip
selects multiple busses & 2 @{B}CF@{UB} Parallel ports. The @{B}5307@{UB}'s two-wire I2C interface
could open up new possibilities in terms of peripheral connection.

@{I}Availability@{UI}
The  system  is still under development but release in early 1999 is a realistic
prospect. Distribution will be handled By @{B}Blittersoft LTD@{UB}.

@{I}Contact@{UI}
Developers  should  contact @{B}IAT Manufacturing@{UB} project co-ordinator @{I}D.S Tarmey@{UI} at
if  you  have  any  further questions. We are quite busy at the present time but
will  endeavour  to  reply  to  your  mails ASAP. This text is not intended as a
formative  product  evaluation,  its  details are as accurate as possible at the
time of release. This is classed as developer information.

@node not35 "TUMULT - ANNOUNCEMENT"

@{B}TUMULT@{UB} - ANNOUNCEMENT
---------------------

@{B}TUMULT@{UB}  is  an  acronym  for  "The Unoffical @{B}MUi@{UB} custom class LisT". As the name
strongly  implies  the  list  contains  information about custom classes for @{B}MUI@{UB}
(@{B}Magic  User Interface@{UB}). Among other things the information on the list includes
the  email-address  of  the  author, a link to a support page if available and a
short description of each class.

There  are several reasons for the creation of @{B}TUMULT@{UB}. One of the most important
reasons  is  that  it  has  always  been  a problem for normal users to find the
classes  they  need.  Not  all  classes  are on @{B}Aminet@{UB} and often the archives on
@{B}Aminet@{UB}  are  not the latest releases. @{B}TUMULT@{UB} will also be an easy way for custom
class  authors to see whether or not they are in the process of re-inventing the
wheel. This is why unfinished classes are needed on the list too.

The  list  is  completely  non-commercial.  It is also independent of the normal
@{B}MCC@{UB}-registration  service,  and  can therefore not be considered official in any
way.  All  classes  can  be  on  the  list.  They  can be officially registered,
unregistered,  candidates  or anything else. They don't even have to be released
yet to be on the list.

You can find the list at the following URL:
@{B}www.amiga.dk/tumult/@{UB}

If  you  have any questions about the list then you can write to @{I}floyd@amiga.dk@{UI}.
If  you  want  to  register  one  of  your  own  classes  then  you can find the
registration procedure (and a template) at the homepage.
