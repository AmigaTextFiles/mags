@{FG Shine}Welcome to AmiChannel News@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 15th issue of AmiChannel News.

Taking into account the sad events happend during last months, probably the best
news of the year is the final release of the long awaited AmigaOS 3.5.

The last revision of our beloved operating system was released six years ago,
in times of Commodore. Although Gateway owe us nothing, we have been waiting for
so long that I think we deserved this version to be released (even before it has
been).

Anyway, I am afraid that we are not going to see another revision of the OS
coming form Amiga Inc., perhaps some bug fixes or additions which were promised
but, for lack of time, have not been included in the final release (including
Miami 3.5 version).

The reason for this is that Gateway is not interested in our OS, so, why not
release the AmigaOS as open source? So far, there are two initiatives to
convince Gateway to do so. The question remains: why two and not only one? The
reason as always is politics. And if they do not work together they are going to
fail. But you never can tell.

Remember to visit the SAUG website, which is located currently in:

         http://teleline.terra.es/personal/angelsau/index.html

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

         noticias@saug.org

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.

                   SHOGO: PROGRESS REPORT. 29-SEPTEMBER-1999
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Progress update by Thomas Frieden

For the last few weeks, our efforts on Shogo concentrated on getting a working
standalone server for Amiga and Macintosh. On the 16th of September, this was
achieved when for the first time, a PC client was able to connect to a networked
game hosted on an Amiga. One of the few bugs that was left in the server was
very strange-looking: the gun pickups were too large, and sticking with one end
in the ground. (Of course, it's fixed now. Wasn't easy to find, though).

The motive behind getting the server to work in standalone mode was simple. The
game consists of several parts: server, client, renderer, and two game-specific
"shells" (libraries of objects for the game). The standalone server can run with
only two parts: the server (of course), and one of the shells. So, instead of
building the client first, which requires, among others, a working renderer
(which is the most complicated part of all), we went for the server. It's
currently only a shell program, so debugging is relatively easy. Plus, the
combination of a PC client and an Amiga server ensures that the engine is
"endian clean".

Motorola processors, in contrast to Intel, use big endian, meaning the highest
byte in a 16 bit or 32 bit number comes first (like in human-readable numbers).
Little endian reverses this order. So, on a Motorola processor, the hexadecimal
number 0xDEADBEEF is stored DE AD BE EF, while on a PC, it's EF BE AD DE. Now,
if data blocks are transfered from from a PC to an Amiga, you'll have to make
sure that incoming blocks are corrected.

Before even compiling the server, we scanned through the source code,
identifying potential problems, and correcting them. Luckily, we've got all but
one (which we caught later). This was one of the most time-consuming parts of
the whole process.

The first compile was a static version; everything was compiled into one large
binary. But, to be able to use modules later, we had to think of something to be
able to use a "dynamic linking" scheme. Shogo uses the windows DLL concept (so
does Heretic 2, btw), so we came up with an 'amigaized' version, making it
possible for Shogo (and of course Heretic 2) to use mods (modifications to the
game, found mainly on the internet) if the source code for them is available. It
will also be possible for Amiga and Mac programmes to write mods of their own.

OK, off to build the client.

                               IMAGINE FOR AMIGA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2nd October 1999 - We would like to assure everyone that Imagine for the Amiga
is still in active development, and will continue to be developed in light of
the future Amiga development plan details released from the Amiga parent
company/Gatway.

Imagine is currently in the Constant Upgrade Program phase, where the current
release is version V5.16. Further PowerPC support, and many enhancements, will
be added in future ACUP releases.

A brief list of additions and changes for the V5.16 release are detailed below:

   * Reworked Detail and Stage editor menus to bring them into line with Imagine
     For Windows.
   * Detail editor: Save object "overwrite requester" improved.
   * Added Lightwave and 3DStudio object export functions.
   * Added three new primitive object types - Hemisphere, Rod and Box.
   * Added new "sharp edges" option to the relevant primitive objects.
   * Added new right mouse button "popup menu" functionality.
   * Added support for double-clicking an object type within the primitive
     object window.
   * Added support for double-clicking a render size type within the
     sub-project/render resolution window.
   * Added "path length" option to Detail editor.
   * Added two new "lite" procedural textures - Purplehaze and Caustics.
   * Added three new procedural textures (in 040 and 060 CPU versions) -
     SSFBumps, SSPBumps and SSRBumps.
   * Optimized PPC version of the MPEG video creator; Now utilises the custom
     PPC maths routines.
   * Improved GUI; This includes the main editors, and the requesters.
   * Added default X & Y aspect ratios to rendering resolution types.
   * Added an Imagine Splash screen. This uses the OS3.x Datatypes, and also
     supports the 24Bit datatype system if available.
   * ...and Miscellaneous other changes/enhancements which are detailed in the
     included AmigaGuide documentation.

Further information and screenshots can be obtained from the main Imagine for
Amiga webpage at: www.cadtech.demon.co.uk

@node not06 "THE WORLD FOUNDRY: OCTOBER UPDATE"

                       THE WORLD FOUNDRY: OCTOBER UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TWF Update

Our website has had a few additions in September. Firstly, we have started
running regular opinion polls on our news page (thanks to a nice little rebol
script) and a new support section.

   * Opinion polls

        The first poll asked the question: "Should Explorer 2260 be made GFXcard
        only ?" We received a total of 81 votes and broke down into the 3
        possible choices as:

                Yes ............... 64
                No ................ 12
                Don't care ......... 5

        The second of our polls which is running at present asks the question:
        "What would your opinion be of a Linux version of Explorer2260 ?" with
        the choices being: "Good idea" "Bad idea" & "AAGGH! Noo!!! Don't do
        it!!" Last I looked the votes were divided roughly 75%, 8% & 17%
        respectively. The poll will be running for another week or so if you
        feel strongly enough about it, go to our site and cast your vote.

        We take into consideration the results of these polls but they won't be
        the deciding factor in decisions we make about our software line.

   * Support Section

        A support section has also been added to the website. This will be
        providing easy access to game patches but since we haven't finished the
        games yet, they won't be there for a while. :) The section will also
        cover additional programs we develop and wish to share with the
        visitors to the website.

        The first program to be offered in this section is the TWFCD player that
        was developed initially to test out the sound library used by E2260 but
        gradually developed into a proper CD player with track number pad,
        album/track display, loading/saving MCDP compatible cd files, link to
        the TWF website and a few other features. The TWFCD player is classed
        as freeware.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explorer 2260 Update

Some more work done on E2260 this month. Still not back to full development with
external projects that just won't go away and Rob moving to NY causing
distruption in the GFX development. Maybe we'll be luckier in October. :)

Anyway, here is what happened in September:

   * Texturing system scrapped and replaced with 16bit version.
   * New network-friendly texture system developed.
   * New texture management tool in development.
   * Testing of sound subsystems complete.
   * Design of entity system enhanced to include multi-script activation on
     entity-specific events.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maim & Mangle Update

Here is what has been done:

   * added collision detection routines (next step I'll add some sort of
     'physical reaction' when 2 or more units collide)
   * added a new experimental zsort - zbuffer routine
   * a few improvments to our editors
   * additional units designed and modeled and textures created

There are another couple of short articles in M&M in the November issue of Amiga
Format and the first issue of the new Amiga magazine AmigActive.

Marras, Eyelight founder and CEO "I'm pretty sure the PowerPack's many images
can cope even with the most demanding creations."

Enhanced by an easy to use index system that can be read by any modern Web
Browser, the PowerPack is compatible with virtually any rendering package and

             IMAGE ENGINEER - FINALLY AN UPDATE (AND A NEW WEBSITE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Marko Seppänen <marko.seppanen@wwnet.fi>

Image Engineer is here again to stay..

Development of Image Engineer has been taker over by Wision, which is the group,
I (Marko Seppänen) am managing.

Last version of this image manipulation program from the original author, Simon
Edwards, was already very good. Sadly it never got famous enough. However some
dared to give Image Engineer a change to show its skills. Since then, they have
been active users of Image Engineer. I was of one them.

Image Engineer is unusual program. So called standards for image manipulation
programs already are set by the big players. Could you just believe that what
ever effect you apply to a whole image or a region, result will always appear in
form of a new image window? Well.. why should it work that way? I could tell you
many reasons, but as you know; 1 picture tells more than thousand stories. Take
a look at the new website of Image Engineer for some eye candy. There you can
also download updated Image Engineer-archives.

Details of next version of Image Engineer will be announced later. Development
has been running half speed, but now it's time to speed it up.

        VAPORWARE ANNOUNCES PUBLIC PRERELEASE AVAILABILITY OF VOYAGER 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The public prerelease version of V³ is available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Newsflash: Changes since V3.0pre3:

   * Now works in demo mode without a keyfile
   * A first PPC version of the Flash player
   * New toolbar images by Loonstar
   * Bugfixes. In fact, this is mainly intended as a bugfix release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not-So-Newsflash: Changes since V3.0pre2:

   * HTTP/1.1 and FTP Resume support.
   * OpenSSL 0.9.4 support.
   * Site Password Manager.
   * Cookie Browser.
   * Bugfixes, minor enhancements, Bugfixes, and more Bugfixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not-So-Newsflash: Changes since V3.0pre1:

   * configurable toolbar, allowing for custom Rexx or Javascript commands and
     custom imagery.
   * major speedup in layouting complex tables.
   * VFlash now compiled for different architectures, and supporting sound
     (using AHI).
   * Bugfixes galore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So enough ranting, now to the bright side. What's new?

   * Javascript. Javascript 1.3, implemented as a nifty just-in-time bytecode
     compiler for maximum efficiency on our dusty 680x0 class machines.
   * Heavily improved GUI, allowing custom placement of control panels using
     Szymon Ulatowski's excellent Tearoff classes (amiga.org.pl/~szulat).
     Create fastlinks by simply dropping an URL in the fast link panel area.
     Reworked MENU structure to be overally more sensible. Added support for
     wheel mice using the NewMouse standard.
   * Fully configurable toolbar with standard and custom ARexx/JS commands using
     Simone Tellini's "SpeedBar" custom class.
   * Much faster layout, with up to 500% speed gain on nested tables, compared
     to V3pre1 and older versions.
   * Heavily improved plugin API now allowing for embedded objects which can
     handle any MIME type.
   * As a first application of aforementioned plugin API: A shockwave flash
     player. Unlike the freeware player which was circulating recently, it
     supports embedded movies and URL handling.
   * SSLv3/TLSv1 security support utilizing OpenSSL (www.openssl.org). Also
     deals with the recent catchword "SGC" by offering 128 bit encryption all
     the time, not only when US crypto laws permit.
   * Modularized image decoders, offered in a wide variety, for all kinds of
     Amiga hardware. Voyager automagically selects the one best suited for your
     machine during start. Also updated are libjpeg and libpng to recent
     versions. Now also supports "smart" incremental JPEG decoding.
   * New Bookmark system using CManager.mcc, sharing URLs and everything with
     other Vapor applications.
   * Improved Cache system which now honours HTTP/1.1 Expires: header - much
     faster loading with properly configured web servers, as cache freshness
     doesn't need to be verified.
   * Numerous other changes.

ToDo

Well, what's still to do?

   * Full optimisation build. This one has been built without any code
     optimisation, and thus is considerably slower than any possible release
     (especially for computing-intensive tasks, like layouting or image
     decoding).
   * JS: Some properties and methods are known to not be fully implemented yet.
     The worst part is that, as with HTML, there is a huge descrepancy with
     Javascript as it is in the books, and Javascript as it's used by
     Web"masters" around the world. Silly, ineffecient constructs and abuse of
     implementation side-effects seem to be a must, and it needs lots of work
     to properly mimick the behavior. Most notably lacking are currently
     <SCRIPT SRC=url>, handling of JS entities <IMG SRC=&{js-code};>
   * ARexx: The ARexx-Port needs as much as work as it needed in previous
     versions. On top of the list is the exposure of the JS interpreter via
     ARexx, allowing you to do nifty things (®) with the DOM of loaded
     documents.
   * HTML: Still lots of minor and major stuff to improve
   * Flash: Speed.
   * Image decoders: A PPC version (now not too far away due to the modularized
     concept)
   * Printing still sucks, and possibly will nuke when you try. Avoid it for
     now.
   * Debugging. Debugging. More Debugging.

Updates to V³ will be released frequently. If you install vapor_update.library,
you will be automatically informed.

@node not13 "PAYBACK STATUS REPORT (I, II)"

                         PAYBACK STATUS REPORT (I, II)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the first in a series of short reports keeping you up-to-date on the
current development status of Payback. To set the scene, I'll give a quick list
of what still needs to be done:

   * Sound effects.
   * Level design.
   * Bug fixing and extensive playtesting.
   * Playable demo.
   * CD cover and manual design.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status report: Part I

   * ...working on the routing mechanism. Routing has been tested by getting
     police cars to chase the player around the map. A series of lookup tables
     has been used to reduce the runtime CPU overhead to virtually nothing.
     Works beautifully, although the pursuing cars still need to be taught how
     to avoid other (slower moving) vehicles! :)
   * ...working on the event scripting. The original plan was to invent a new
     interpreted scripting language that would be used to describe events in
     the game. However, as I explored this I quickly realised that the
     scripting language would be mimicking a lot of the features already
     implemented in C. Then it hit me - why not use a seperate compiled C
     program as the script? I implemented this over the weekend and it worked
     beautifully. This method also has the advantage of taking less processing
     time than an interpreted approach would have - helping to keep the game up
     to speed without sacrificing expandability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status report: Part II

   * ...squishing bugs. There were lots of problems with the collision
     detection. It's now been made both faster and more reliable. Still needs a
     bit more work though.
   * ...implementing the audio mixing code. I've come up with a very versatile
     system that monitors the exact 3d position of all the sound effects and
     mixes them in stereo using the inverse-square law. It can play up to 12
     sounds at once, and realistically simulates the doppler effect. What's
     more, the performance hit should be negligable once I've converted it to
     assembler. As you can probably tell, I'm pretty pleased with it -
     especially since it's all being done through Paula!
   * ...compiling the soundtrack. I've been talking to various bands about
     appearing on the soundtrack. Hopefully, I'll have more news on this next
     update.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, that's all for now. See you next time!

                        APRIL-SOURCECODE FREE UNDER GNU
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Markus Bieler"

Hi,

The C source code for April has been released under the GNU General Public
License.

If you don't know what April is, here's a short intro from the docs:

"A FidoNet Technology compatible tosser and editor for the Commodore Amiga line
of personal computers, specially aimed at points. A lot of time was used to make
April as user-friendly as possible, without making her too slow or too
inflexible. Together with a mailer like Trapdoor it's simple to set up a good
working pointsystem."

It has been uploaded to Aminet, and should be available soon in the comm/fido
directory. Alternatively it's also available on redrival.com/aobl/software.html

Bye, Wilfred

Hello,

13.10.1999 - Code name Hell Squad, new action-adventure game.

     Last month we have purchased resources of one unfinished game from AVM.
     Their game was far from finished, but it looked very promising to us, so
     we have decided to buy it. Now we are improving it and now you have a
     chance to take a closer look on it because we upload the demo. Besides,
     you can find out what it is all about on our web site (games/hellsquad).

13.10.1999 - New screenshots added to Diablo's Land page.

     Last two weeks we have been preoccupied preparing Code name Hell Squad,
     therefore we didn't update Diablo's Land web page. But now here's new

                        FREECIV 1.8.3 BETA IS AVAILABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Kimme Utsi" <kimme@arcticnet.no>

The excellent client and server freeciv is finally available for us Amiga users
who doesn't have an 'X Windows' server or client installed on our computers.
Here's the .readme, and it can be found on his homepage. :)

Now I'm happy as now I don't have to find users on the Internet to play as this
version can have upto 15 computer controlled players. :)

Introduction

This is a native compile of Freeciv. It also has an own client which is using
MUI. That means you don't need have ixemul.library or a XServer. Actually the
client is not completely ready yet, but most things should work.

Usage

Freeciv is a multiplayer game and divided into sever and client. But of course
it's also possible to play freeciv on a single machine.

The first step is to start your TCP/IP stack (e.g. Miami). You don't need to go
online if you only want to play Freeciv on a single machine. The next step is
starting the server and then the client. You can do this either with help of the
Workbench or from the Shell (Freeciv allocates hopefully enough stack itself so
you needn't set a high stack value). After the client has been loaded you can
connect to the server.

Alternatively you can start the server and the client with the provided
Freeciv.start shell scripts. Before it loads the server and client it opens a
filerequester where you can choose whether to load an old game or start a new
game.

For more details on usage view the README.org and HOWTOPLAY files, which are
also included in this package.

Authors

The authors who are participated in the Freeciv project are listed in the
AUTHORS and PEOPLE files.

The Amiga Version of the client was created, as well as the server was compiled,
by Sebastian Bauer. If you have question or problems with this version, feel
free to ask me.

Future
   * complete the client
   * compile with optimization and special processor versions

History

Version 1.0 (27.09.99)
   * corresponds to Freeciv 1.8.3 (beta)
   * first public release on my homepage

                        FUSION PPC - POOR USER RESPONSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Paul Lesurf <paul@blittersoft.com>

To all Amiga emulation users,

Blittersoft would like to make a statement regarding the response to the Fusion
PPC Amiga situation.

Whilst Microcode Solutions announced the 60 day countdown on September 20th,
there was not the required 500 prepayments that were supposed to trigger this.

As announced by Microcode Solutions, Blittersoft made the commitment for 500
orders to enable this product to actually see the light of day. This was made
with some confidence given the many users who stated they would pay after the
countdown began.

Unfortunately, despite over 600 pledges, we have seen about a third actually
prepay. Many have declined to authorise and the situation is that we have backed
this process believing the Amiga community who made a commitment would actually
follow through and keep their word. This is despite the countdown being close to
half way.

Whilst I accept that there will be those who circumstances may effect the
ability to complete their pledge, I think it is fair to say that this would
cater for a handful. It is sad to report that many people who pledged must have
done so without ever considering the consequences of failing to meet this
pledge.

Well, the consequences are that Blittersoft will not make this type of gesture
again. The same situation could well happen with the PCx PC software. Again,
there have been many requests (about 350) and it is Microcode's intention is to
begin the countdown for this after the Fusion PPC is released and 500 pledges
become 500 payments.

Blittersoft will be prepared to make the same gesture and back the product to
the tune of 500 orders if we receive the level of support promised by the Amiga
emulation community.

Everyone knows the situation with Amiga development. Piracy is still a big
problem and now it seems that even planned schemes to secure development can
also not be trusted.

The bottom line is that the Amiga needs quality support by it's users if there
is still to be quality development.

I will end with a simple request:

If you did pledge your suppport to pre-pay Fusion PPC and have not done so,
please reconsider and do so now.

Best wishes,

Paul Lesurf
Blittersoft

          NOVA DESIGN/NEWTEK ANNOUNCE MILLENNIUM FOR THE TOASTER/FLYER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Millennium is coming...

Millennium for the Amiga Video Toaster/Flyer is nearly here. It's extremely
cool, it's wildly powerful, and it will give your Toaster and Toaster/Flyer
amazing new powers to help you make your work look better than ever before!

The Millennium package is presented by Newtek and has been produced by Nova
Design, Inc. in cooperation with all prominent Toaster/Flyer developers. It is
not to be missed.

What's Inside

Millennium is not merely a single package. It is a collection of software,
scripts, effects, fonts, backgrounds, and other content designed to update your
Video Toaster and Flyer dramatically. Millennium was designed to be the largest,
most comprehensive, upgrade you could put on your system. Millennium is for the
Toaster owner as well as the Flyer owner.

You'll find some old favorites are now part of the Millennium package. Some
packages you will be familiar with and some will be brand new to you. Some
existing packages have been upgraded significantly for the Millennium release
and some have been made Toaster-friendly and Flyer-friendly as well. Here is a
list of what you will find in Millennium.

   * Wipe Studio - You may be familiar with the `lite' version--but this is the
     complete package! Use it to create your own wipes and effects for the
     Toaster and Flyer.
   * RenderFX - Upgraded for Millennium, this package allows you to render your
     FlyerClip sequences down to a new FlyerClip. You can then layer more
     video, CG, and effects for a far more impressive production.
   * Flyer Utilities - Includes utilities for converting Toaster wipes between
     3.x and 4.x formats, Undeleting FlyerClips, Timecoding and much more.
   * ProMix - Also upgraded for Millennium, this package provides audio tools to
     let you add audio to video, import/export audio formats, add audio to
     FlyerClips and animations, and more.
   * Fast Frames - Allows you to `Toasterize' your Video Flyer by pre-recording
     CG sequences, Framestore montages, and create flying CG effects and more.
   * Fast Fuel Millennium - Adds video deck control to the Toaster/Flyer
     interface for automatic clip recording.
   * Electric Scene Knife - This can save you literally hours of work. The Knife
     can take a FlyerClip and automatically find the different scenes within it,
     mark them, and even offer to cut them into separate FlyerClips for you.
   * Flyer Backup - A script based system that can backup your actual FlyerClips
     to a hard drive or to removable media.
   * CGPilot - The famous CG ARexx scripts that automate many time consuming CG
     tasks.
   * Toaster Wipes and Effects - There are hundreds of these and most are
     available for both Toaster 3.x and 4.x so both Toaster and Flyer owners
     can use them. These include wedding wipes, fire wipes, basic animated
     wipes, cool soft gradient wipes, and fully rotoscoped motion matte wipes.
   * MegFX - Over 40 Flyer 4.x effects that perform real-time, full dual-stream
     (dual-clip), split-screen and layering effects directly in Flyer projects
     with no rendering.
   * Backgrounds - Hundreds of full color, professionally drawn, backgrounds for
     you to use in your CG pages or in ToasterPaint.
   * Full motion backgrounds - FlyerClips of animated scenes, fire, and more.
     You can use these with your Flyer for CG backgrounds or as royalty-free
     stock footage.

There are many other features of Millennium. We've really just touched the
surface of all the tools and content that are included in Millennium to make
your Toaster and Flyer more productive for you. Millennium also includes
hundreds of new ARexx commands for scripting, programmer's manuals for the
ProMix and RenderFX tools and more.

The package will include three CDROMs filled with wipes, effects, fonts,
backgrounds, software and more; full printed documentation, a video tape
overview of the package and a comprehensive color catalog of other Toaster/Flyer
products.

Check this out!

Millennium will be available by the end of October 1999 from your favorite Amiga
Video Toaster/Flyer reseller. Suggested resale price is only $349.95 and you can
preorder now!

This upgrade is the largest-ever for the Toaster and the Toaster/Flyer. Order
