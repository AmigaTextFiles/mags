   ATTENTION!

   When  you leaving Izviestia #10 you should take care about your datas in
RAM  or  other  working  programs!  Magazine  works fine and doesn't change
anything in system, but (I think so - I don't know asembler, so I can't fix
it)  PT-CIAPlay (used player) probably does... So - BEFORE leaving magazine
save all your datas to disk - just for be sure. Sorry for that bug.
