<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I>The latest in this series; a look back to the great Arkanoid/Breakout clone 
in a class of its own, Crystal Hammer.
</I></H4>
<HR>


<CENTER><H3>Introduction</H3></CENTER>

<P>Now before you say "Oh great, another Breakout clone," consider this: that an original cannot 
truly be referred to as a "clone," that a classic stands the test of time.</P>

<P>Not that Crystal Hammer was by any means the first game of its type; Arkanoids and Breakout 
had certainly been around for some time. But in terms of the Amiga, it was the first, or at least first 
fairly complete, game of its type. And it is a classic. For its time, it was a game of remarkably high 
caliber, sometimes even rivaling (with all due respect to the Mackey brothers) MegaBall, today's 
high-end entry in that arena.<P>

<CENTER><H3>Description</H3></CENTER>

<P>I'm sure I need not spend a large amount of time covering the fundamental theory behind such a 
game; simply, you are given a paddle which you can slide along the bottom of the screen, in an effort 
to keep a small ball from going past. That ball, in turn, when in its element, goes around knocking 
aimlessly into things and, ideally, destroying them for points. There are generally a number of boards 
offering different configurations of "bricks" (or "crystals" in this case).</P>

<P>All games of this type operate on this premise, and yet all of them (or at least all the good ones) 
add their own unique twist to the formula. Crystal Hammer is no exception to this.</P>

<P>When you first start the game (generally accomplished by booting from its disk), you are 
presented with a screen that provides such information as who programmed it (Guido Bartels), who 
did the effects, graphics, and sound, etc., and then at the bottom "Hannover in November 1987." It 
also tells you 
that you may continue your game if you accumulate 10,000 points.</P>

<P>Once the initial startup screen disappears (at which point the game has finished loading), onto 
the screen pops a nicely-done graphical logo for the game, which alternates periodically with the high 
score/initial list, maintained during run-time only (in other words, full of GIB's when you start up). A 
very well-done piece of music also plays during this interval (remember, it WAS, after all, 1987).You 
can then start either a 1- or 2-player game via use of the left or right mouse buttons respectively (2 
players simply take turns).</P>

<P>A player is given 4 extra lives to start with, represented by small versions of your paddle in the 
lower left corner. The boards themselves (and there are 30 of them) are colorful and varied, actually 
being a repeating sequence of several backgrounds themselves composed of multiple tiled images 
(this game is easy on memory). Everything is instantaneous, by the way, once the game finishes 
loading; no waiting between boards, no pauses when beginning a new game.</P>

<P>As already mentioned, the point of this game is to destroy the crystals (there are several different 
colors), arranged over the background, and more or less octagonal in shape. In the meantime, look 
out for "worms" that emerge from the top of the screen and slowly make their way to the bottom. You 
can destroy them with your ball or paddle, and they're worth a good number of points, but they can 
unexpectedly deflect your ball, annoying if it happens to be speeding along.</P>

<P>There are, of course, Power-Ups, in this case taking the form of falling "pills" (basically rapidly 
spinning crystals). Only one may be falling at a time. It should be noted that the white crystals never 
yield "pills;" the others always will if one is not already present on the screen. Various types of "pills" 
include the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Red:</B> This turns your paddle into a gun of sorts so you can sit there and blast away at 
will.
<LI><B>Orange:</B> An extra life!
<LI><B>Yellow:</B> Slows your ball down a notch. It can travel at several speeds (slow, medium, 
and insane! plus a few more intermediate ones).
<LI><B>Green:</B> Lets you catch the ball on the paddle and launch it with a mouse click, rather 
than simply deflecting it.
<LI><B>Sky Blue:</B> Multiplier. Turns the 1 "hammer" (ball) into 3. Also suspends further pills from 
falling until you lose 2 of the 3.
<LI><B>Royal Blue:</B> Extension. A wider paddle makes it easier to catch the hammer...as well as 
a DEATH pill!
<LI><B>Pink:</B> Advancer. Takes you right to the next level, regardless of your current 
circumstances.
<LI><B>White:</B> Er...you die. This is the "crystal suicide" aspect of the game. Of course, it's 
possible to be forced into catching one...and just TRY to differentiate between yellow and white on an 
old monochrome monitor...!
</UL>
<P>Each of these gives you points among different nice powerups. Yes, even the white pill of death 
is good for points.</P>

<CENTER><H3>A Little History</H3></CENTER>

<P>Being quite old, this game is naturally very hard to find. I haven't looked in great depth online, but 
my source was an old disk. For me, this goes back to my days of using my Uncle's A500 (thus the 
aforementioned monochrome monitor), back in 1987 (goodness, how the years go by...). All I know is 
he brought some disks over one night, saying "Sorry, no games this time," and then the next day I 
learned the kind truth.</P>

<P>Being quite old, this game is also not very system-friendly. It's unfortunate, and that alone is what 
first drew me to MegaBall last year (of course, I've grown quite fond of that game as well now). Let's 
just say if you have anything better than AmigaDOS 1.3, you're out of luck. Of course, it takes over 
the machine and leaves no exit route (you can probably forget the hard disk). Again, it's the MultiStart 
board that lets me even write this review. I don't know if there's a patch to make Crystal Hammer 
more system-friendly, but if you have this game, it's probably worth looking for.</P>

<P>Also considering the advanced age of Crystal Hammer, I officially ask you, the Amiga community, 
if anybody either remembers this game, or has any knowledge of the whereabouts of Guido Bartels, 
the author, and particularly if he has ever done anything else for the Amiga. If we could gather some 
information on this old game, it could prove quite interesting for a future AM story. So the call goes 
out! Please let us know if you know anything about this.</P>

<CENTER><H3>Conclusion</H3></CENTER>

<P>I can say from personal experience that I've spent many an hour playing Crystal Hammer. One 
truly remarkable aspect of it is that not only when it was new, but also by today's standards, the 
gameplay is very smooth, the graphics are good, and the sound effects truly sound like they belong 
there.</P>

<P>You may be able to find this game online somewhere, or maybe even in your own disk collection 
if you go back to the earliest years of the Amiga. If you do, another thing to look for is CHEdit (Crystal 
Hammer Editor) which allows you to edit the boards. I have left my own distinctive touch upon my 
own Crystal Hammer disk through use of that program.</P>

<P>Finally, I'd tell you about the ending of the game, but unfortunately, I can't. I've never been able to 
finish the game! The furthest I've gotten is somewhere in the high 20's, so board 30 continues to 
elude me. If I was terribly curious, though, I could use CHEdit to rig it with no blocks on any board in 
order to just breeze through. I suppose I'm still just holding out hope to eventually get there, however. 
I'm beginning to suspect that, if I ever do beat the game, my Amiga will morph into a 68060/AAA 
machine with 128mb 32-bit 60ns Fast RAM, 8mb Chip RAM, 64-bit SCSI-III interface, Zorro IV bus, 
and Amiga OS 4.0 right before my eyes. Hey...you never know.</P>
