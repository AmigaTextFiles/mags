<CENTER><H1><I>Editor's Notes...</I></H1></CENTER>
<P>Isn't it just in such typical Amiga fashion...<BR>
The Day of Decision came and went without event.<BR>
September 20 was the day that the proposed deal between VIScorp and the creditors currently 
controlling ESCOM's assets was supposed to be finalized. Was it? No. In fact, we're still waiting for 
results. One might begin to wonder if we will ever get anywhere.</P>
<P>Well, it is autumn, and over here in the United States, the New York Yankees have advanced into 
the Major League Baseball playoffs. They were a dynasty team for much of the century, winning an 
amazing number of World Series Championships, but it's been a number of years since they have 
enjoyed such success.</P>
<P>And where has the Amiga been? Rather displaced...since the beginning of the decade, that is. 
And, of course, the last 2 years or so have been the worst of them all. Worse yet, we really don't 
know what to expect at this point.</P>
<P>The Yankees had an interesting series last week, but managed to get through it and advance to 
the next level. But they sure had us wondering for a little while there! Us New York baseball fans, 
however, are happy about this; they might just make it.</P>
<P>So can a little of that fall magic rub off on the Amiga? Will it get through this difficult, seemingly 
impossible stage? Well, the Yankees managed it last week, but then again, no matter what happens, 
they'll still be there next year.</P>
<P>Of course, it's not too late to believe the platform might survive; after all, it's lived through the 
most arduous times imaginable.</P>
<P>But in any event, here's the pitch...</P>
