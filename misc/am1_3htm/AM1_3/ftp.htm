<P>This article will concentrate on another excellent but often
overlooked internet tool, FTP.  I will show you an example of what is
called "Anonymous FTP".  This means that you will be dealing with a host
computer on which you don't have an account.</P>

<P>FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is used to retrieve files from
another computer.  The files can be retrieved in two formats, binary and
text.  Binary is the format programs are in (they contain non-text
characters).  Text is usually ASCII.</P>

<P>Using FTP is very easy. I will use Aminet as an example.  First type
"FTP aminet.com".  Upon connection you will presented with a
welcome screen with a banner "NETNET". This is the current home of the
Aminet archives.  You should see a message that says "Using binary mode
to transfer files."  If not you will have to change the file mode
after you log on.  We will get to that later.  You will be prompted to
enter a name. The great thing is that you have already been provided
with one. (aminet.com:anonymous).  Just hit return. You will them be
prompted for a password. Since you are using anonymous you will be
expected to input your E-mail address. Once again it should have
already been put in for you.  In my case it is "(d.green7@genie.com):"
so just hit return. If all goes well you should get a message telling
you guest logon is OK.  It will also tell you that restrictions apply.
The restrictions are because you do not have an account on the host
computer. Don't worry, the restrictions shouldn't cause you any
problems.  From here on in, if you are familiar with DOS, (Amiga or
MS) you will feel right at home. To get a directory you type... you
guessed it... "dir".   You will be presented with a list of files and
directories.</P>

<P>The columns contain different information on the files and
directories.  The important columns for our example are the first and
last.  If you look at the first digit in the first column you will see
that some of the rows start with a "d".  This tells us that is a
directory.  The directory we want is pub.  The host that we are on is
UNIX, so everything is Case sensitive.  That means if you type PUB
instead of pub, the system will reply that it can't find a directory
PUB.  Type "cd pub."  This will put you in the directory pub. If you
check the contents, you will find mostly directories.  The one we want
of course, is aminet.</P>

<P>Cd aminet and call up a directory and you will see the familiar list of
directories and files.  I recommend that you get the index.  It is listed twice, once as INDEX and again 
as INDEX.Z. They are the same file, the "z
suffix on the second one indicates that it is in a compressed format. To get the file use the "get" 
command.  Use the format "get INDEX" or "get
INDEX.Z" for whichever version you want. Unfortunately I don't know of
anywhere to get a program to decompress .Z files except on Genie. If I
find a site I will certainly post it.  If you did not get the message
"Using binary mode to transfer files" when you logged on earlier, type
"binary" to switch the system.  The other mode is ASCII. For a list of
commands for FTP type "help".  That will bring up a list of commands the system understands. Use 
the cdup command to get the "parent" directory of
the one that you are in.  For example if you are in pub/aminet/games and
you want to back up to animet, type "cdup;" this will take you to the
parent directory.  When you are finished exploring, the command to
leave is "bye".   I hope you have enjoyed this quick tour.</P>
