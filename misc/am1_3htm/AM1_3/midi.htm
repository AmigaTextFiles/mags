<P>Hi everyone, and welcome to The Amiga Monitor issue #3! It's
been one short month since my last MIDI article, and for
those of you who may have missed the last one, I was
giving short descriptions of some of the MIDI programs I
use. I started last month with sequencing programs Bars &
Pipes, SuperJam, Texture, Music-X, Master Tracks Pro, Deluxe
Music Construction Set, and inadvertently jumped to a
notation program, Dr. T's "The Copyist DTP" (Desk Top
Publishing). Having recently purchased a copy of the Copyist
DTP, I find myself writing more about it than the other
programs I've been using for years. So.... here goes!</P>

<P>Dr. T's was one of the first programs I used with my
Amiga, and 'tho I've heard from many people who have tried
it and did not like it, I find it's a very powerful program even
by today's standards. The last version that was available to
the Amiga, Dr. T's KCS (Keyboard Controlled Sequencer), came
bundled with a graphical editor called Tiger, a notation
program called Quickscore, a graphical mixing program called
Automix, and an Algorithmic composing program called Level
II. Although the Amiga provides a multitasking environment,
most programs are not able to share information without
first saving a file to disk, then loading it to the second
or third program running. Not true with Dr. T's. Dr.  T's
utilizes a feature it calls MPE (Multi Program Environment).
This way you can load the above programs, record some
tracks, and instantly switch windows to edit the tracks
without saving/loading to disk. A very nice feature that
seems to have been implemented in just about every pro-
style sequencing program available on any platform is the
Auto Mix feature. You can record multiple tracks, then open
the AutoMix window, select "Output to KCS" and record
volume, Pan, or _any_ MIDI control change information you'd
like directly to a KCS track. The Quickscore feature does
leave one wanting more, although it does exactly what it
says. Record some tracks, switch to the Quickscore window,
and look at what you've recorded in standard notation. You
can't edit from the Quickscore window, but combined with
some global settings like Quantize, Transpose, Key Signature
etc. you get fairly good output that can be printed. This
is where The Copyist DTP comes in. This is the premier
notation program for the Amiga at this time. Like all Dr.
T's stuff, it's a little quirky at first, but I've found it
to be a great program, especially when writing music from
scratch.  The Copyist has very few limitations like so many
other notation packages available.  Most notation programs
set up in either 12 staff or 18 staff per page, with 2 - 6
bars per staff per page. I find this _very_ limiting. If you
are writing a complete score, this makes sense, but if you
are writing for a single instrument per page, I like to be
able to have each line configureable.  If one measure has
all sixteenth notes, and the next a whole note or rest, the
Copyist lets you set the bar divider anywhere. This way the
16th notes can have a bigger area, and not look so crowded.
The Copyist has many other features, and you can bet I'll be
talking more about using this as well as the other programs
in future articles here in The Amiga Monitor. One program I
also use quite often is MidiQuest.  Again this is a program
from a few years ago, and it's been ported to the Mac and
pee-cee machines. The Amiga version is no longer being
updated (the current ver is 4.0 I think), but it is the best
synth editor I've seen available for the Amiga.
Unfortunately, the Amiga version won't do samplers, but it
has a lot of available drivers for most major brand synths
made. I use it mostly with my Roland CM64 as
an editor/librarian. I also use the librarian for my Korg
Poly 800, Ensoniq KS32, Roland A-50 controller, and a few of
my effects units. As far as samplers and editor/librarians go,
I've heard the Sample Wrench is a good program, but I am
unsure if it is still available to the Amiga platform.
Perhaps some readers can let me know if it is, and I'll pass
the information on in a future article. There are a few
shareware programs I find _very_ useful also, so I'll share
a few thoughts on them. Having a few older synths can have
its disadvantages, and some good points. I have a 12-bit
sampler by Roland called an S-10 . It does some good
samples for 12 bit, but the real problem lies in its disk
drive. It will only let you load 4 samples at a time, and
its disk drive is a 2.5 Quick Disk! These disks hold only
one sample equal to about 2 to 4 seconds per side depending
on the sample rate. When one side loads, you have to flip
the disk over to load the other side. Very archaic indeed!
so, If I want to load 4 samples, I need 2 disks inserted and
loaded a total of 4 times. Also, the Quick disk is _very_
expensive. About $35.00 per box of 10. They have no sliding
window, only an opening that allows no protection to the
exposed part of the disk. I would think they would be much
cheaper than manufacturing a 3.5 HD disk; go figure.
Anyway, I found a shareware program to solve my problems!
The program is called Sample Dump by Dieter Burns.  The
archive that would be in an online database is called MKS-
100.lzh.  This program allows me to hook up to the Amiga and
load/dump direct to hard disk! Now I don't have to pay $2.50
per sample to store my sounds, no digging around for the
right disk, no flipping disks over and hitting the load
button one more time :). There are a _lot_ of cool shareware
programs out there for many purposes. THANK YOU
AMIGA COMMUNITY!</P>

<P>I've received a few letters from some
readers, and I'd like to invite anyone reading to go ahead
and write, if only to say hello. One reader, Dhomas, has
some news I'd like to share.  Dhomas is currently writing an
Amiga Editor/Librarian himself, and is currently using it
in his studio. I am getting a copy to look it over, and
perhaps I'll write a bit on it next month, so stay tuned for
a *NEW* Amiga thing! Here's a description of the program he
sent:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hi there Fred!</P>
<P>Read your Amiga Monitor article  (Sep96) and wanted to let
you know about our software: MIDI SYStem EXplorer.  It is
currently on Aminet</P>

<PRE>mus/midi/MSE.lha</PRE>

<P>If you haven't seen it yet have a look.  Or if you don't
have access to Aminet, email me and I'll send it to
you. Here's some info:</P>

<P>young monkey studios<BR>
ANNOUNCEMENT: It has arrived... the long awaited MIDI SYStem
EXplorer (MSE). Due to an overwhelming amount of mail
pushing for an earlier release of MSE, we have decided to
make a pre-release version available.  If you have not
already done so, download mus/midi/MSE.lha from your
favorite Aminet site.</P>

<P>ABOUT MSE---------Many, so called, UNIVERSAL PATCH EDITORS
have come and gone for the Amiga.  One of our biggest
complaints, and the reason why we are making MSE, is that
these editors are not anywhere near UNIVERSAL.  The approach
others have taken is in requiring 'modules' to be
purchased for each MIDI device to be controlled.  This is
fine as long as you can get a module for EVERY device you
have.  But we all know that, especially on the Amiga, this
has not ever happened.  Then of course, when the company
goes out of business or discontinues the program, no further
modules are ever made. So, along come a few other public
domain and shareware authors to try and fill in the hole.
These programmers either chose to code individual editors or
make an another attempt at a UNIVERSAL EDITOR of their own.
These UNIVERSAL EDITORS require you to be able to program in
C or Assembler in order to make your own editors.  If you
wanted to do that why would you bother with their patch
editor at all? Well, MIDI SYStem EXplorer has arrived...
 we do not claim that MSE is a UNIVERSAL PATCH EDITOR...
we are not sure such a thing is even possible, but MSE does
strive to solve a lot of these problems:<BR>
1) Development of
other programs stopped because nobody was buying it,   and
no editor exists for my new one of a kind MIDI ZEN-
ZAMBULATOR.  MSE is being developed for our own studio use,
first!  Even if nobody else wants to use it, we will
continue to develop it.  Its development will continue
regardless of whether anyone buys it or not.  We have been
using our Amigas for over 10 years, and we do not see that
stopping for a long time.  Even if we did stop developing
MSE, you would very likely still be able to create new
modules, because MSE already supports most MIDI formats.<BR>
2) You are a musician, you do not know how to program in C, or
Assembler or any other language.  And if you did you would
rather be composing than programming modules!  MSE
supports modules created by the MSE-Compiler.  It converts
text definition files into modules that MSE can use.  The
compiler uses an easy-to-learn language specifically
written to be as easy to understand as possible.  In many
cases, you can simply modify an existing definition file to
work with another device.  If you can use a text editor and
you understand X/Y coordinates you will likely learn MSE's
definition language fast.  See the definitions  directory
for samples of definition files.  Once you get a hang of
things, making modules is FAST.  And once you have the
editor done, you will be amazed at how much time is saved
and how much more creative the process of sound generation
becomes!  Definition files and modules will be freely
available.  So, if you are not interested in making your
own modules
you can still use modules made by us and others.<BR>
3) Other editors do not work while my sequencer or other program is
running.  MSE will run in conjunction with programs that use
the public domain  MIDI.library or BlueRibbon.library.  MSE
is also expected to support  the Amiga CAMD.library once
programming documentation is obtained (soon).  Imagine
being able to edit patch data while having that MIDI
information recorded directly into a sequencer.  It is
possible and opens up great creative possibilities.<BR>
4) Other software is too expensive!  We think so too. WHAT WILL
MSE DO?-----------------MSE has been designed to control all
types of MIDI data through a programmable graphic user
interface or by external software control. MSE can be used
as a simple MIDI Controller or a complex patch
editing system. Some possible applications:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>MIDI Volume/Pan Mixer
<LI>Patch Editor
<LI>Patch Librarian.
</UL>
With the definition language you can design the entire user interface to meet
your needs.  Screen mode/size (Amiga/CyberGFX/etc.), 
window size and position, fonts,
borders, colors, gadget placement, etc. can all be
customized. As well, you can define the character set,
MIDI port (Triple Play Plus is supported) and much
more.<BR>
Features:
<UL>
<LI>Extensive customization allows
the user to design standard interfaces for all MIDI
products connected to the system.
<LI>Graphic interfaces are designed external to the main program.  This minimizes
memory requirements and increases the interface speed.
<LI>Just about everything is customizable, including: layout, fonts, gadgets, colors, images, menus, 
MIDI events, etc.
<LI>Allows the user to enter MIDI information from a device's user manual     and configure a custom 
interface to access parameters.
<LI>Supports ALL MIDI events.
<LI>Patch/Librarian data is stored in MIDI standard format, for easy importing to other software.   - 
Has the ability to edit individual parameters on devices that only support patch dumps.
<LI>MIDI communication can operate with realtime feedback and/or through user interaction.
<LI>Edits can be made without connection to a MIDI device, if required.
<LI>Includes lots of examples and common device interfaces, to get you started.
</UL>
WHAT WON'T MSE DO?
 <P>Waveform editing (samplers) is
  not supported.  Another program  WaveFormer (under
  development) is being designed for this.- Probably some
  other things too, but that first one was the most commonly
  asked about. THE FUTURE----------This is a pre-release
  version and many features have been disabled until they
  are working properly and other features have yet to be
added. One of the most exciting features still to be added
is ARexx support. This will give ARexx programs complete
control of MSE, allowing you to program volume fades, alter
patch data, generate random patches or anything else you can
imagine.  ARexx support has been planned from the beginning
and is already 80% implemented but has been disabled until
the module data format becomes more stable. There will be
lots of other things added in, making MSE even more useful.
As always, we are happy to listen to any suggestions you
might have.</P>
REQUIREMENTS:
<UL>
<LI>WB 2.x+
<LI>Text editor
<LI>MIDI interface
<LI>MIDI.library or Blue Ribbon.library (both included)
<LI>Understanding of MIDI documentation to create custom modules
</UL>
RECOMMENDATIONS:
<UL>
<LI>Simple paint program for layout design
<LI>WB 3.x
</UL>
