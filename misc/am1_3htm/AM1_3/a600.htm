<P>The A600 has always been known as the unexpandable Amiga; this is no longer 
so. My good friend John Goodie (co-founder of the Cecil Amiga Users Group) and I had 
been discussing for some time his upgrade options. I recommended that he get an  
A1200, but he wasn't quite ready to shell out the dough. So he and I both began a small 
endeavor to find out what other options he had for his A600. I searched on the Web and 
he began calling dealers. I found a Web page that advertised an Apollo accelerator for 
the A600, so he notified the dealer from which he had already ordered his 3.1 OS upgrade kit about 
this accelerator. To make a long story short, the day after he received and 
installed his 3.1 OS upgrade, he also received his Apollo accelerator. I was privileged to 
be present and assist in the installation of this amazing device.</P>

<P>Although adding the 3.1 OS to the A600 is an improvement, you don't really reap 
the benefits until the accelerator is also added. John bought the accelerator for his A600 
from Software Hut for $189.00; it is a 25mhz 68020 with a 68882 math co-processor, 
and can house up to an 8mb SIMM memory module. This gives his A600 a total of 10mb 
of memory: 2mb chip and 8mb fast ram. This is more than he will probably ever need.
The installation was rather easy; the most difficult task was removing the metal shielding because of 
the uncooperative tabs. Once the shielding is removed, it's a breeze because the accelerator simply 
snaps over the top of the existing 68000 CPU, and it's a good 
snug fit. The only thing you must be sure of is that you get a SIMM module that is petite, 
meaning one that the board on which the actual memory chips are located is no larger than the chips 
themselves. If you do not get a very small SIMM, the accelerator will not fit.</P>

<P>The accelerator claims to increase the performance of the A600 7 to 8 times and 
I believe it. After installing the Apollo in John's A600, I felt as though I was sitting in front 
of my 40mhz A1200, no kidding. The only problem we came across was whenever you 
interrupted the normal bootup such as using the Amiga early startup control or using a 
pal boot disk the fast ram was not recognized. I do not know if this was a problem with 
the simm or with the Apollo; nevertheless it's a small price to pay for the increase in performance. 
Overall I'd say the accelerator is well worth the money and if I had to rate it 
between 1 to 10 I'd give it a 9. If you have an A600, get it.</P>
