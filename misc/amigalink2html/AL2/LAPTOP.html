<PRE>     It hit me all of a sudden.  There I was, walking down the cafeteria in
 my school, when I saw it.  A laptop.  I was mesmerized.  All my thoughts
 turned to it.  It was like the equivelant of a woman's biological clock
 telling her to have a baby.  All of a sudden I couldn't live without a
 laptop.  


     I thought about this urge for a while.  I honestly couldn't think of
 many things I'd use a laptop for.  The only ones that immediately came to
 mind were for typing notes in class, using the Internet while I was not
 occupied with other classwork, and writing stories as I was in the car.
 In reality none of these reasons was good enough to buy a laptop instead
 of a new A1200 with a 68030 accelerator when they finally come out.  And
 yet it didn't seem to matter.


     "Oh, what can I do!" I thought.  I wanted a laptop, but I didn't at
 all  want to buy a hideous PC, and I didn't like the idea of a Mac too
 much either.  I had heard of the hack to put your Amiga into a laptop, but
 I didn't trust hacks too much, and besides, I didn't have a spare Amiga to
 use.  


     For days I pondered my problem, until I came upon the Amiga World Wide
 Web Page.  I read the three articles by ex-C= employees, and read their
 talk of this technology and that technology, and I realized like never
 before how badly C= had screwed the Amiga.  Not just a lot.  No, Commodore
 did about as much to kill the Amiga as humanly possible.  If you ever read
 these articles you'll be sick to your stomach, and vow to kill Medhi Ali
 and Irving Gould.  And yet, these articles gave me new hope.  How, you
 say?  How could such depressing articles give me hope?  They did, because
 I saw how incredible the Amiga technology still is.  I saw that as soon as
 the buyout is over we can have machines that we'd never even DREAMED of
 before.  I saw machines that would blow every PC user's mind.  But more
 than that, I saw technology that could easily make a laptop Amiga, which
 could run all my favorite word pros, games, comm programs, and much, much
 more.


     And I saw that the new company that will own the Amiga can't be as bad
 as C=.  I saw that there was no way that they could make such hideous
 decisions.  I knew that they'd eventually make a laptop Amiga.


     And I saw myself calling my dealer to pre-order one as soon as they
 were announced...
