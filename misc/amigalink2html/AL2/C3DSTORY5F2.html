                      Some Bits of Treasure Part II 


                     




    Tom handed the tablet back to John Delacroix after staring closely at
 the plainly visible symbol on it.
    Again Tom remarked, "I can't believe how that looks like the Commodore
logo and nothing else even faintly looks like our alphabet!"
    Heading to the laptop, John replied, "We're right on the edge of
 something, aren't we?  If the symbols are similar, then we should have a
 clue soon."
    Tom moved to sit out the wait on the rock ledge, turning his head
 slightly to hear faint scuffles of an insect in the tunnel.
    Shortly, his curiosity vanished as several robed men quickly, but
 quietly, moved into the chamber.  They were holding large, sharp knives
 that looked very unhealthy to Tom.
    A man stepped forward and said, in clear English, "Please do not make
 sudden moves and put your hands out."
    They did as they were told.  Tom was not an expert in nationalities,
 but the men all looked native to this region.
    The man spoke again, "Do you think we are fools that you could come
 and take away our treasures?  I myself have studied at your Yale
 University.  I learned much more than just what nice locks they make.  But
 enough.  Tie them up." Four big men obeyed.
    The leader continued, "And in gratitude for your efforts for us, we are
 leaving you your lives."
    He motioned to a man, "Take the tablets and their machine."
    A scowl replied, "But the laptop's no good, it's five months old! DOS
 27.21 is out now and you need 40 meg ram."
    The leader glared angily, "Did we train you for nothing? We need the
 data in the machine," and pushed him towards it.
    As they left the chamber, with John and Tom well tied, the leader
 turned and bowed slightly, "It has been a nice transaction."
    Struggling against the ropes was futile.  "What do we do now?" Tom
 moaned out.
    As if in response, a small shape moved out of the shadows.  He was a
 young boy shabbily dressed in clothes of the region, no more than 14, Tom
 thought.
    "Can I help?" he asked.
    "Yes! Untie us, " John answered. "We have to catch those men."
    The boy, an orphan named Armand, said that was impossible.  The men had
 camels and were riding into the desert.  They would skirt the far end of
 the rock cliffs to reach an oasis on the other side by nightfall.
 Besides, the leader was Razsca, a man of bad reputation.
    "But," he said, "I know an opening in the cliffs.  It is big enough for
 me and I will be there by dark.  Will it be worth fifty dollar American to
 get your things?"
    "Yes, at least," John said after a thoughtful pause, "But will you be
safe?"
    "Not a problem," Armand replied.  "I will be less than a shadow to
 them.  Wait here for me," he said slipping away.
    Tom looked questioningly at John.  "I sure hope you know what you're
 doing."
    About five hours later, as night fell, the boy left a cleft on the
 other side of the cliffs and hid among the plants of the oasis.
    Razsca and the men rode up and dismounted.  He turned to one, "You have
 the things?"
  "Yes, they are hidden with the meat," was the grunted reply.
  After drinking, the men moved to the other side to camp and Armand stole
 in among the camels. He lifted the sack and ran back the way he had come.
 But, in his haste to get up the incline to the cleft, the boy's foot
 caught on a rock and he fell flat, the bag sailing over rocks to the sand
 a few feet below. That sudden noise dislodged the largest bird he had ever
 seen.  At first he thought it was a vulture, but it had the long legs of a
 secretary bird.  Whatever it was circled tightly, scented the dried meat,
 caught up the bag, and was quickly away along the cliffs.
    In shock, Armand watched his fifty dollar hope and the hidden secret of
 the tablets slowly become a speck on the horizon and then disappear.


                                 to be continued...
