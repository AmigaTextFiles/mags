<PRE>     
     I believe that the CD32 has been the greatest product that C= ever
 made, with the A3000 coming a close second.  I know that I have already
 incited thousands of A500 owners to take up their pens (or word
 processors!) and start writing to me, but hold on a sec.  Look at what the
 CD32 has done for the Amiga.  First of all, the CD32 is a potential cash
 cow.  For every CD32 game that is sold, C= gets money from it.  That may
 not seem like a lot, but how do you think Nintendo managed to get profits
 in the billions in the late 80s?  It wasn't from selling Nintendos at $90,
 let me tell you that.  Of course, C= won't make as much money, because
 they charge less in royalties, and because there were more Nintendos than
 there are CD32s, but it's still a start.  With that money, the new owners
 could pay for new advertising campaigns or lower the price of Amigas and
 CD32s.
 
     The CD32 has already brought the Amiga one great advantage despite
 the low number sold.  That is the boost that it has given to Amiga games.
 In recent months, fewer and fewer Amiga games have been made, but the CD32
 games just keep on coming, and they are good (or atleast better than many
 normal Amiga games).  This has also brought the Amiga up with the CD-ROM
 revolution on the PCs and Mac in a short space of time.  Had the CD32
 never come out, we'd have no standard Amiga CD setup, and many fewer CD
 titles, perhaps none at all.  
 
     And finally, the CD32 has the potential to make the Amiga a household
 name.  We've all heard of Sega and Nintendo, so why not Amiga?  The CD32
 was even written up at one point in Playboy (although I can't imagine how
 many people we're reading Playboy)!  That kind of press functions even
 better than advertisements on TV.  Sega has relatively few ads but has
 sold incredibly well.  It's obvious that people buy based on what they
 read and by what the see at their friend's house, not from TV.
 
     So, to the new owners, whoever they be, get out the CD32s!  Start
 selling them for $200 and £175 in the UK.  Start selling them in every
 electonic's chain across the world.  Start giving them to magazines free
 so that they can review CD32 games (hint hint!).  Do everything you
 can.  In the end, the CD32 may save the Amiga.
