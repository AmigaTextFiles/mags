<PRE>     As mentioned before, in the last month we have added new ways to get
 Amiga Link. 
 
     If you wish to receive Amiga Link in e-mail each month, mail the
 address &lt;amigalink-request@ramiga.cts.com&gt; with the message 
 
 ADD &lt;your e-mail address&gt;
 
     Then, every time the magazine comes out, it will be mailed to you
 UUENcoded.  The magazine is quite big, so if your e-mail address cannot
 accept messages of atleast 100k, don't put your name on the list.  
     If you want to be taken off the lits, do the same thing, but
 subsititute DELETE for ADD.
 
     If you have the use of AMosaic or Lynx on your BBS, you can view Amiga
 Link online on 5 different WWW pages.  Their addresses are:
 
 
 <http://ramiga.cts.com&gt;
 
 <http://weber.u.washington.edu/~foregone/amigalink/main.html&gt;
 
 <http://www.iglou.com/members/dloeser.html&gt;
 
 <http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/~mjw/amiga/News/Alink&gt;  The Amiga home page!
 Check this page out!

     Ofcourse, you can also get Amiga Link off of the docs/mags directory
 of Aminet, or off many local  <a href="BBS_LIST.html">BBSs</a>.
