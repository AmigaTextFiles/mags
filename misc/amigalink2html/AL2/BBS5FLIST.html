<BODY>
<PRE>     Due to a hard drive crash, we have lost much of our BBS list, and we
 did not have enough time to recompile it all.  In fact, we are not even
 sure if we wish to do it at all.  
     
     
     What do you guys think?  Should we include a BBS list?  Please mail
 all reponses to &lt;jgalun@maple.nis.net&gt;
