<PRE>     March has been an incredible --and hectic-- month at Amiga Link.  We
 started off the month with a bang by hiring a new technical editor, Roy
 Millican!  Roy then promptly proceeded to write two articles, set up a
 mailing list for Amiga Link, and placed Amiga Link on five WWW pages!
 Look in the distribution page of this magazine for more info.  
 
 
     It was one week later when hell began to freeze over: the Emplant
 e586 module was finally released.  After months of hearing claims of "Just
 one more month," thousands of people finally received their shiny new e586
 modules.  Utilities Unlimited, neglected, however, to ship the neccesary
 ROM BIOS with the e586, and soon the praises that had been given to Jim
 Drew turned to hate.  
  
  
     As if that wasn't enough to give the Amiga community a collective
 heart attack, we then received some of the best news we've had in months:
 The C= buyout was FINALLY going to end.  This is not an April Fool's joke,
 people, even we're not so demented as to make up something of such grand
 importance as this.  The latest news is that on April 20, in New York
 City, there will be an auction for C= and all the technology and products
 that go with it.  The starting bid will be Escom's, and all other bidders
 may enter bids, as long as they are at least one million dollars more than
 Escom's bid.  Then, on April 21, also in New York City, a court hearing
 will take place to accept the highest bid for C=.  This is not expected to
 take too long, and should run with relatively few problems.  Once the New
 York courts accept the bid, it goes to the Bahamian court, where it will
 presumably be accepted, bringing the C= buyout to a CLOSE!  I, for one,
 can't wait!
 
     
     The public court hearing will be held at:  Room 610-2 of the United
 States Bankruptcy Court, The Old Customs House, One Bowling Green, New
 York, New York, on April 21, at 10:00 a.m.  I, as well as a few other
 Amiga users, will probably be at the meeting; if you are interested in
 going, and would like to meet us there, please e-mail me!  I'd love to
 see you there.
     
    
     Anyway, keep your chin up, have a stiff upper lip (whatever that
 means!) and hug and kiss your Amiga every day, telling it that you love it
 with all your heart.  
 
     Until next month!
     
     
          Joshua Galun
         Editor-in-Chief
         

  
      First, I would like to thank the sysops who voluntered to distribute
 the magazine.  
 
 
     We have some good news for people living in the East coast.
 The auction with Escom and the other bidders will take place in NYC!
 The other Chief Editor is planning to go to the auction!  I might too.
 We will try to upload a textfile saying who won the auction.  And last but
 not least I would like to thank you, the reader. 
  
          John Vlachos
         Editor-in-Chief
                               
                               
     Note for those confused readers who are wondering who is the REAL
 Editor in Chief of Amiga Link.  Actually, John and I are BOTH the Editors
 in-Chief.  However, we both handle different aspects of the magazine, John
 more along the lines of spreading the news about the mag, uploading the
 mag to assorted BBSs, and handling the BBS list and letter's column,
 whereas I handle the content of the magazine, get the articles, and edit
 the magazine.
