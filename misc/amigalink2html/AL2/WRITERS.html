     Many people think that they could never write for Amiga Link.  They
 think that their writing is not good enough, or that they don't know
 enough about a subject.  My advice is to ignore these feelings.  Most of
 the people who write for Amiga Link used to feel teh same way.  While
 chatting with them, they'd tell me an in-depth analysis or review of
 something, and then, when I saked them to put it into writing, they said
 "But I don't know enough about it!"  I twisted their arms and look where
 they are today!  
 
     So, if you have anything Amiga related that you'd like to share with
 the world, or would just like to see your name in print, mail me at
 <jgalun@maple.nis.net&gt;
