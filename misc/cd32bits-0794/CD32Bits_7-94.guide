@node CD12 "CD For The A1200"

At the time of writing, there are two PCMCIA CD-Rom drives due for
release.  The first at the end of June, and the second some time in
July (Zappo).

The first to hit the shops is manufactured by the same company that
produces the Overdrive, and uses the same technology to access the CD as
it did for the hard drive.  It is said to be 90% compatable with the
current range of CD32 games, and comes with software which will allow it
to read PhotoCD disks straight away.  Naturally it will not be possible
to have FMV.    Because it uses the PCMCIA slot, all internal trapdoor
expansions such as Accelerators and Ram Expansions will still work.  One
would speculate that if the Commodore CD1200 ever arrives, it now might
be hard pushed to sell any units, because the main complaint seems to
have been rectified by the third party companies..   Price at the moment
is set at £200

Expect a full review upon release!

@node como "Commodores Future!"

Rumours are still flying around about who the buyer of Commodore will
be.  Although everybody is shouting Samsung, it seems that they may now
be out of the running!!  From the same source comes the nasty comment
that Phillips are still in the running.  If this is the case, and
Phillips do buy the technology, it is highly likely that the CD32 will
be thrown into a big hole straight away.  Phillips are sure to drop the
CD32 due to the fact that it is CD-I's major source of competition, and
it is also likely that they would use the AAA technology in the new
generation of CD-I machines....  This is a truly worrying thought,
because thousands of CD32 owners will be left in the lurch.  As far as
any buyout is concerned, Phillips would be by far the worst prospect for
the machine.  The problem lies in the fact that The Bahamian Courts have
told C= to sell to the highest bidder.  If the likes of Sony or Samsung
pull out, there is no one left with the financial 'oompf' to outbid
Phillips and a very grey day could be with us.  Let's hope it never
comes to that!!

@node batc "BattleChess"

                BattleChess             £26             Interplay

The alltime best chess game for the Amiga finally makes it's way onto
the the CD32.  Unfortunately, it seems to be the original version that
was released for the CDTV a couple of years ago!  For innovation, the
most that can be said about this game is that it has a very long demo
which introduces you to all of the pieces in a chess game.  The pieces
possible moves and strategic uses are fully explained with a voice over
from the piece in question, and without a doubt, if you had never played
chess before, this demo mode would be enough to teach you the ins and
outs of the game to a satisfactory standard to actually play.

The major problem with this game is naturally going to be the price.
Battlechess is a very dated game, and consequently does not really
warrant the conversion to CD32.  The original floppy disk version was no
more than 400K, so there is a lot of space left, and you may well feel
slightly put off at the thought of paying so much for so little.

If you have the money to burn and you are also a fan of chess, then
BattleChess is a worthy title for your money.  However, if like most
people once you have seen all of the pieces animations you get bored,
this would be a definate title to avoid!!

Imagine the sort of game that you used to see on the original NES, and
you have BattleToads.  It comprises awful, uncontrolable sprites with
awful backdrops and awful sound.  It even has a game plot to match!
Battletoads is absolutely terrible.  It ranks alongside Seven Gates Of
Jambala for the worst CD32 game.  Theres nothing else I can say about it

@node heim "Heimdall 2"

                Heimdall 2              Core Design             £30

As a simultaneous release with the normal floppy versions, Core Design
have released Heimdall 2.  The original Heimdall, released two years ago
was an incredible success due to it's combined use of action and
strategy elements.  Does Heimdall 2 live up to the original?  Well, the
short answer is yes.  The same elements are then, but far more polished
than in the original.

For those of you who do not know what Heimdall is all about, well he is
a Viking, and it is his mission to rid his land of evil.  The game takes
on a 3D grahical approach, and uses both a joystick and a mouse for
control.  If you donot have a mouse, the CD32 controller can be used,
but it is far more awkward.

You have the choice of controlling one of two characters.  One of the
problems with the original was that there were far too many characters
to have to juggle with whilst playing.  Thankfully this problem has been
solved.

The game does have some dissapointing aspects.  Core had promised an
intro, but there is no evidence of one.  It is just a straight port of
the A1200 version, with some music.  It would have been nice if some
speech had been added because in game SFX are very lacking.  There is
plenty of room on the CD afterall, considering the floppy version comes
on seven disks...  The final point is that it comes in a double CD case,
which is a pain if you stack your CD's in a rack....  Apart from those
few points, Heimdall 2 is a good choice for your collection!!

@node impo "Impossible Mission 2025"

              Impossible Mission              £30             Microprose

At long last comes the sequel to the C64 classic..  Impossible Mission
was a 1986 smash, and now Microprose try to repeat the success with a
revamped 90's edition!!!  But, does it succeed?

In @{"Impossible Mission 2025" system "vt imposs.jpg"} you play a man whose mission it is to escape
from a planet inhabited by killer robots!!  You must travel around the
huge platform levels, solving puzzles which allow you to leave a level
and access the next.  The backgrounds and sound are great, although the
sprite is rather badly drawn and animated.  The puzzle element is hard
enough to keep players thinking, but not so hard that you end up
throwing the disk in the corner after a few hours of not getting
anywhere.  You can pick from three characters to control, each with
specific abilities to help you complete levels.

All in all the game is a well polished effort which will keep you hooked
for a long while.  Unfortunately, it is a direct port from the 1200
version, but with such a game, that doesn't really matter.  As an added
bonus, you also get the original C64 version included, and the only
problem I could really find was the dissapointing introduction.  If
Microcosm and Impossible Mission 2025 were combined, we would have a
sure fire hit on our hands!!

           James Pond 3                £36                  Millenium

If you,liked James Pond two, you'll love this.  In a style very similar
to Mario, James Pond 3 continues where number two left off!  It, like
many others before it is a sometimes puzzle solving platform romp.
Where it stands out though is the playability.  This is not one of the
platform type games that you get bored of very quickly, James Pond 3 is
sheer enjoyment.  It has all of the elements that have made Mario one of
the most popular games in history.

It has cutesy graphics, dull backdrops, nice sound and loads of levels.
The gameplay is not too hard, but with a difficulty level that will keep 
you coming back for more.  The control method is even good, when using 
the supplied CD32 controller, which comes as a welcome suprise.

Now.  There @{b}are@{ub} minus points, and two major ones at that!!  Firstly, it
is ridiculously expensive.  Secondly, there are no enhancements over the
floppy version.  The only difference between the two is the CDXL anim at
the beginning, and even that is identical to the one seen on the CD
version...   The price is just far too high.  Had it been a more
reasonable ten pounds cheaper, it would have scored another mark, but at
that rediculous price, it has to be penalised.

@node lost "The Lost Vikings"  

            The Lost Vikings                £26               Interplay

This is the second offering from Interplay this month.  Once again, it
is a direct port of the floppy version.  Same intro, same sound, and
same non-AGA graphics.  You could question why this was not released
very early on in the CD32's life, because there is no excuse for non-AGA
games to appear anymore.  They have had plenty of time to convert it, so
why haven't they??

In The Lost Vikings, you control three vikings, all with specific
abilities whose task it is to make their way through the puzzle ridden
platform levels to try and return to their home.  There are tasks along
the way which you have to complete to procede any further, and to do
these, you have to combine the Vikings various skills.

The Lost Vikings is pretty standard in all departments.  It really has
no distinguishing features which would lead me to recomend it above any
other CD32 platformer.  As i've said before.  If you are a fan of the
genre, you'll probably be happy with the game, however, if you're not,
you will hate it.

@node sabr "Sabre Team"

              Sabre Team              £30             Krisalis

Hmmmm, heres a strange one!!  Sabre Team, is a game in a similar style
to Blue Bytes releases, Battle Isle and Historyline.  You control a team
of four soldiers whose task it is to wipe out all of the baddies and
save mankind.  You control each of your four men independantly, and once
each has made a move, the computer makes the bad guy's moves.

The graphics are nothing special, although they are AGA, but the games
distinguishing feature is that it has loads of sampled speech.  This
always adds a much more involved feel to any game, so I don't know why
more programmers do not use it at the moment!

The game action can be very boring at time, the controls are bad with
the CD32 controller, and the game is quite buggy!!  As with most games,
half the price and a couple might sell, this is far too expensive for
what it is...

Heh, look, it's a CDTV title, rebadged and re-released as a CD32
game....  What a cool idea, I don't think!!  The game even says CDTV in
a booming voice when you load it up.  Basically, the game is TV Sports
Football (American Football that is) with interspersed action and
commentary shots!!   A bit of a turkey really, and probably only worth
about five pounds in real life, but then again, C= don't live in the
real world do they??

      Wembley International Soccer            £30             Audiogenic

Now here's what we need, another football game.  As if we hadn't got
enough of them already, along comes yet another, that claims to be the
best one that you have ever seen.  But is it??

Well, it's certainly the best one on the CD32 so far, although a bit
difficult.  It features a number of international teams, and all of the
sprites are large and colourful.  The game makes use of the extra buttons 
on the CD32 controller and, all in all,the control method is quite good.
Now, most people would say that Sensi has to be the best Football Sim
available, but the CD version has crap sound.  In comparison, WIS's
sound would seem like actually being there.

I am not a fan of football games, but of the one's available for the
CD32 at the moment, this is by far the best.

@{"Cyberwar" system "vt cyberwar.jpg"} is the follow up to the highly successful PC CDRom game The
Lawnmower Man, which is unfortunately now cancelled as a CD32 project.

Due for a Christmas 94 release, Cyberwar ia a visual as well as
interactive feast and is certain to become a CD-Rom success.

You take the role of Dr. Angelo as you pit your strength and ingenuity
against the seemingly unstoppable might of Cyberjobe from within the
cybercomplex of the VSI mainframe computer.  Your mission: to seek out
and destroy the VSI weapons system left behind from your last encounter.
Explore and select your own unique path through a variety of
mind-bending levels, featuring amongst other things, breathtaking flight
and weapons simulations, mind-bending puzzle logic sequences and some of
the most awesome enemies you are ever likely to encounter on CD-Rom.

CYBERWAR also features full colour footage from the film, stunning
interactive ray-traced 3D graphics, full screen interactive video
gameplay and the real Cyberjobe... all in 256 colours.  In fact, the
game is so big, SCI claim to have had a job fitting it on to 3 CD's.
Whether this is the case, we will have to wait and see..

Expect ma comprehensive review upon release!!

@node carm "Letter For Carmen Rizzolo"

    I just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed your last issue
of CD32bits (June '94).  I'm an american, and I don't have a CD32 quite
yet, but I hope to have one soon.  I'll be getting the FMV cart too, not
because I want it, but because I may be developing for CD32.

    Question: Does the FMV cart give CD32 another meg of FAST RAM?  I've
heard this as a rumor, and if it's true I'll be delighted to buy it.  A
meg of FAST RAM would really speed up 3D games on CD32.  Kind of expensive
just for a meg of ram tho.

    Keep up the good work.

Carmen Rizzolo - Crazed Artist
CarmenR@cup.portal.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Carmen,

Right, as for the FMV module..  AFAIK, the module comes with 2Mb of
Fast Ram on board, but this can not be used by the CD32 when the cart
is not being accessed!!!  A great shame, I know.  For the extra RAM,
your best bet is going to be to get the SX1 expansion slot when it is
released (should be soon).  This will allow you to have 8 megs of Fast
on board, although you can only have another 4 if you have the FMV
attached!!  You will also be able to attach an IDE HD, external
floppy, keyboard and Genlock if you wish..

That unit should be available in the next few months.  It would have
been out ages ago, but the company (Microbotics) that was producing it
has sold out to another company (Paravision).  At the moment, there is an
alternative called the CD32x which gives you all the same features as
the SX1, but does not look anywhere as nice. For 1140ukp, you can get
The CD32, FMV, Expansion Dock, and A Genlock.  The Dock on it's own is
450ukp, which is much more expensive than the projected price for the
SX1.

There should be a complete review if the SX-1 expansion slot in next
months CD32Bits, as it was released too late for review!

@node tfx "Letter From Alain Ducharme"


Hey nice job!  Thanks for putting your electronic magazine together.  I
don't actually own a CD32 but heck I'm just as interested.  Actually I'm
kinda hoping the CD/FMV module for the A4000 can finally make it out the
door one day.  I have actually had a chance to test drive the CD32/FMV for a
period of about four days, we have a wonderful store here in Canada (there
name is actually Wonder Computers!) which is renting everything from the
CD32 to CD games and FMV titles.

In your last issue, in the "Coming to a CD32 near you" section, I noticed
there was no mention of T.F.X.!  GASP!  They've been advertising for years
(ok, many, many months, over one year), is it ever going to be published on
any of the Amiga platforms?

Hi Alain,

Whoops, I think that apologies are in order.  Imagine me forgetting TFX!
Anyway, it is still on track for a '94 release, but I would not expect
anything before Christmas.  That should also be the case for Inferno
and Rise Of The Robots.  Expect amazing things from October onwards!

@node inca "Letter From Kevin Baker"

My friend's just bought a CD-ROM for his PC, and got a CD called Incarta with
it. It's a sort of encyclopedia on a disk (by Microsoft). It's got bit's of
FMV (although only in a small window of course) on it and all that. Sounds
really good. There's a bloke that talks you through experiments to do with
light particles and everything. If you could get something that good on a CD32
(or a A1200 CD add-on) I'd sell my grandmother to buy it. To be honest, I'm
not that interested in games.

Kevin Baker (2:251/41.8)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Kevin,

Thats the problem at the moment though!!!  The majority of CD32
programmers are only interested in the games side of the machine..
There are a couple of serious releases dedicated to the 32, but these
are few and far between.  There is a Guiness Disc Of Records, which is
pretty awful and quite a good Electronic Encyclopedia, but that £100!!
There are also a couple of serious FMV titles.... One for Dinosaurs and 
the other about planes!!   It's probably just animations that come up on
the window on the PC because not many people have ReelMagic so it is not
viable to put it on.  To get proper FMV, PC owners have to get that, and
a proper 24Bit card, or they have to watch in 256 colours which they
might as well do from a normal anim.

As far as Multimedia disks go, I think that the PC and MAC will control
the field for a very long time..  Some of them are really good, but then
again, those machines have been using the CD media for ages compared to
other platforms.    I should think that the CD32 will catch up, (if it
survives), but as with all things, you just have to wait!

@node movie "Linking Hardware"

This month, replacing the usual FMV reviews, I have decided to do a
run-down of the various methods that you can use, now or in the near
future, to link your CD32 to another Amiga so that the CD can be used as
a file server.  Next month, there will be a head to head comparison of
each of these methods of linking!!

                        @{"The SX-1        " link sx-1}

@node seri "The Serial Link"

Name     : The Serial Link

Supplier : The CD Exchange
           Unit D5
           Hi-Tech House
           Blackfriars St
           Norwich
           NR3 1SF

Price    : £29

The serial link is a cable which allows direct connection of the CD32 to
another computer, be it Amiga or PC format.

Unlike the cable reviewed in the June issue of Amiga Format, this cable
comes ready to run, and is a lot better value.  The cable has had the
Null Modem Lead (required to run the transfer software) built into it,
so there is no extra expense after purchase.

The cable connects between the AUX port of the CD32 and the Serial port
of the remote machine.  It also features a pass-thru' socket on the CD32
end which allows a keyboard to still be connected.

Once linked up, a software package such as TwinExpress or Sernet must be
run to allow access.  By far the best program to use at the moment is
TwinExpress, but this is far from perfect.  It is a Cli based
application which takes a little getting used to before any real use can
be made of it.  It also suffers terribly from errors, in that, if you
make a mistake, the program will quit at both ends which can be a real
pain.

For the price, The Serial Link does it's job well, and for the user on
a budget, it should suffice.  The only thing that causes any real
problems is the initial setting up of the connection, which, without the
correct software is very cumbersome.  This though, can be easily solved
with the appropriate software.  The problem lies on the CD32 end, in
that, there are very few disks which have a properly working verison of
TwinExpress on them.  To solve this problem, I would suggest also
purchasing the @{"CD Exchange Volume 1" link cdx1},  also from the same company which
tackles the problem admirably.  See review elsewhere in this issue!!

@node sx-1 "The SX-1"

Name     : SX-1

Supplier : Most retailers, but distributed in the UK by :-

           ZCL
           Unit 1
           Ringway Industrial Estate
           Eastern Avenue
           Litchfield
           Staffordshire
           WS13 7SF

Price    : £200


The SX-1 will not be available until the beginning of July, so a concise
review cannot be included yet.  What I can tell you though, are it's
published specs....

The SX-1 is said to be able to turn the CD32 into a fully fledged A1200,
with a CD-ROM drive.  It features all of the ports found on an A1200,
plus more.  It has parallel, serial, disk drive, internal and external
IDE interface, RGB output and a slot for up to 8Megs of fast Ram.  It also
has an audio in socket for audio mixing..

There will be various options available with the unit, such as keyboards
and power supplies, although what these will be used for I cannot
confirm.

I have included the SX-1 in the linking round up, because it allows you
to use ParNET.

As soon as a review unit becomes available I will put it through it's
paces.

@node comm "The Communicator"

Name     : The Communicator

Supplier : Eureka
           Adsteeg 10
           6191 PX Beek(L)
           The Netherlands

Price    : 220DM or 130DM for Communicator Lite


Coming from Eureka in the Netherlands is The Commmunicator.

The Communicator enables the CD32 to communicate with any Amiga or PC.
It allows you to use the CD32 as a 2 way CDRom drive, view PhotoCD's
(with supplied software), make FMV or audio presentations and view
various image file formats such as GIF and PCX straight from CD.  It
will even allow you to view AGA images that are on a Non-AGA machine.
The Communicator also has support from Scala and MediaPoint, allowing
you to use audio or MPEG tracks in your Multimedia creations.

In addition, there is also a cut down version, The Communicator Lite,
which is the same unit without MIDI, keyboard throughport and expansion
capability.  Natuturally, this unit retails at a slightly lower price.

The Communicator plugs in the CD32 AUX port and the Amiga/PC serial port
and allows data transfer at 115200bps.

One of the best features of this package is the ability to view
PhotCD's.  Eureka's viewing software Photolite is included with both
models and does the job perfectly.

The Communictor also has built in presentation tools.  In a similar
style to Scala, you can create demo's etc from the material on your
CD's.  It can use CD Audio and MPEG and is capable of cutting between
different MPEG streams to genlock text over the top of it.  All of these
features including wipes, pages and transparency are controlled by the
remote Amiga.

To conclude, The Communicator is a great solution to the linking problem
plus it also has many specialized features which keeps it one step ahead
of the competition.  For speed of data transfer, it has no real advantages
over using the much cheaper Serial Link,  But it is the ease of actually 
making the transfer that will undoubtably become it's selling point.

               CD Exchange 1           @{"CD Exchange" link cdex}             £20

CD Exchange 1 is a ShareWare/PD CD containing a vast amount of software
including - Games, Graphics, Animations, Music Modules, Sound Samples,
Adobe Fonts, CG Fonts and Clip Art.

The CD can be totally controlled using the CD32 pad, and a custom menu
system has been included to allow ease of use without having to actually
go through the disk via workbench.

The disk has full transfer support, and is invaluable for anyone using
the Serial Link Cable.  It includes TwinExpress, Parnet and Sernet.
Obviously Parnet has been included for use when the SX-1 becomes
available.

To solve the problem of the CD32 booting everytime the lid is opened,
scripts are included which mount a RAD disk containing either
TwinExpress or ParNET.  Once rebooted, the CD32 boots from RAD and
allows you to change disks and access them without the machine
resetting.  This is a very welcome addition and will save hours of
frustration.  This feature also allows access of non-booting CD's and
therefore you will be able to use PC CD-Roms, and transfer files from it
to the remote machine.

If you plan to use any type of Serial Link Cable I would strongly suggest
that you buy this disk at the same time.

@node grol "Groliers Electronic Encyclopedia"

        Groliers Electronic Encyclopedia                £100

The first thing you notice about this title is it's enormous price tag.
But when you consider the price of serious PC CD-ROM titles, it starts
to look a little less daunting.  Now, what can you say about an
Encyclopedia??  Well, not much really!!  This disk is jam packed full of
useful, and pointless information that you may need in the course of
your life.  The user interface for accessing the huge database of
facts, is very easy to use, and you quickly find yourself flying around
the disk grabbing useful snippets of information.

The disk has a large number of picture files which are associated with
the text, and also a small amount of speech samples to accompany the
pictures, such as The Martin Luther King speech.  These are by far the
best feature of the disk, and the sample quality is flawless, (something
which cannot be said for the CDTV encyclopedia).

For practical purposes, the disc is much more geared to a young American
audience, with a lot of the facts being much more relevant to life in
the U.S, but that doesn't stop the disk being one of the first titles to
actually exploit the CD media in an appropriate way.  If you look hard
enough, you'll be able to find the disk for about thirty pounds less
(See Viking Computers), and if you have the money, this is a worthy
investment.

Written by the same team responsible for The Encyclopedia and in a very
similar style comes The Guiness Disc Of Records.  The only diffence us,
that this one is absolutely pointless.  I'm sure a lot of hard work went
into the CD, but it is unlikely that it will appeal to the masses.  I
suppose it's a worthy challenge to buying the book version, but as a
standalone CD32 produce, it doesn't really cut it!

@node vide "VideoCreator"

                VideoCreator            £40             Almathera

Now here is one of the titles that everyone has been waiting for since
the CD32's release.  All I can say is, the wait has been worth it.
VideoCreator is exactly what the CD32 needs.  You will find nothing as
good as this on any other format....

VideoCreators purpose is self explanatory, but for those of you who are
only interested in games, well here is an idea of a product that you
must buy!!  VideoCreator is a CD32 only title which allows the
synchronising of large amounts of video effects with digital
soundtracks.  It has no real purpose, but it is brilliant and utterly
absorbing.  If you have ever watched rolling demo's and wished that you
could do it, well now you can, and better one's too!!  The CD is crammed
with various images, animations and the like for you to add to your
favourite CD tracks.  When the SX-1 unit becomes available, you will
also be able to include your own pictures and animatons in your demo's,
or, if you cannot afford one, you can send your work off to Almathera
for inclusion into the various update disks that have been planned.

Constructing your demo's is easy via a simple point and click interface.
Everything is set out so that the novice user can create simple shows
straight away.  Included on the disks are some example files which show
you what VideoCreator can do.  There are sample scripts to accompany CD
soundtracks by Madonna, Prince, Bryan Addams and even the Commodore FMV
advert!!   There is also a great feature called Random Raves which
randomly adds pictures and anims to any CD soundtrack that you choose..
This feature would be great at parties, as you could have accompanying
graphics any piece of music that you choose.

That said, VideoCreator is slightly pointless at this moment in time.
Until the SX-1 becomes available, there is no way of saving your work,
so anything you do will be lost.  Also the size of your demos is heavily
influenced by the CD32's memory, but once again, the SX-1 will solve
this.

All in all, VideoCreator is a masterpiece.  If you intend to buy an
SX-1, it is essential that you buy a copy of this, and if you don't,
well buy a copy of it anyway.....  It's bloody good fun, and better than
any of the games available at the moment!!
