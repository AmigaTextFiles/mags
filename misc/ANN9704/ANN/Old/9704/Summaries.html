<UL>Dr. Peter Kittel says that <CITE>Motorola has some tool to convert 68k source into PPC source to
offer already</CITE>, but that <CITE>This is an approach when you want to see something at all, soon.</CITE>
So this only works for a few, well-written programs, while <CITE>much hand fiddling</CITE>
and <CITE>the guy/people who had done the original</CITE> is required for
compilcated programs. <CITE>The AmigaOS
source is said to use dirty tricks like in the 6502 days, like jumping
into the middle of another statement to save a few bytes in the executable.
Such cases are nightmares for automatic conversion</CITE>.

<UL>Dave Haynie says banging the Amiga chips is
wasted time for anything commercial. Draggable screens are one of the
least useful features of the Amiga, he doesn't use separate screens
anymore either (but then he's running his A3000 at 1180x900).
<CITE>Sliding screens are just eye candy, they're not necessary</CITE>.
He then speaks about games, system conform vs. banging, game API's...
<CITE>I said the Amiga's approach [hardware banging in older games, etc.]
was very, very wrong</CITE>. He thinks there are still hardware hitting
games and demos being uploaded to Aminet <CITE>ecause you have kids there</CITE>.
<CITE>Free stuff doesn't need to worry about working at all,</CITE> [..]
<CITE>real game people are writing for other machines</CITE>.

</B></FONT> (30-Apr-97

<UL>Rainer Benda says one of the problems with
Petro T. is that he doesn't accept persons in similar positions to his
own, one example being Mr Domayer (who is now head at PIOS). Rainer
says the only solution would be to get rid of Petro, but to achieve
this one would need to mail Gateway, which would be fairly difficult;
first reason being that Rainer would be considered as Ex-AT employee
seeking for revenge, second reason being that nobody really knows what
Petro does. Petro is smart enough to give only as much information
as really necessary, so that people get the impression that they would
be lost without him. Rainer thinks that, despite Gateway, chances for
a good future are very low, due to the reasons above.

<UL>Joern Plewka comments on the PIOS One and
on the A\Box. He says it makes no sense to hate the PIOS One, because,
after all, Haynie and Kittel are working on it, those two being very
respectable persons. He then proceeds to say that he doesn't think
that Phase5 cards are too expensive, but that the Amiga itself is
showing its age. On the other side, the Phase5 (PowerUp) approach
might not be a good idea, since the (patched) OS might slow things down
severely. The post also includes statements about the &quot;Mac version&quot; Pios One,
about PCI cards, MSIE, Aminet, AROS; but since my space here is limited
I can't go into details.

<UL>Concerning the question whether future Amigas
should have a custom chipset, Dave Haynie gives an example.
<BLOCKQUOTE>You can't tell by
looking if I have one or two hearts, or two, four, or six chambered
hearts, or whether my heart is in good shape, or plaqued with fat.
You figure I'm a human by the surface stuff. It's the same with the
Amiga: the hardware is the organs; you assume something about these
organs when you see the Amiga nameplate. Usually you're right, but
there are these really fast machines out there, which are pretty much
the same as always, only way faster. Those bad boys have alien six
chambered hearts, courtesy of Phase 5 or VillageTronic. They still
have the same skeleton, same flesh, same musclature, same mind. Then
again, a few have been training their brains on one of those Altair-IV
brain test machines (got '060 card), or even alien brain transplants
(PowerUps).</BLOCKQUOTE>

agreed with the Gateway management that the AmigaOS sources should not be
given to other persons/companies for porting. This probably means that there

on the Amia, one can concentrate on the animation, as there is no OS

They only contacted Andy and him 7 months after acquiring the Amiga assets.
One month later, they showed their PowerAmiga plans to them, but Escom
<CITE>waffled on it</CITE> and ended up having no money for anything.
Some time later at PIOS, development was entirely different.
<CITE>We started knowing we wanted to make a new computer.</CITE>
In summer '96 it looked like a super-low-cost AT box, but as the
AmigaOS &quot;disappeared&quot; it became more high-end, starting to look
like a BeBox, then evolved to use more current and/or integrated parts
and finally was modified once again in mid-January for CHRP.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nearly every engineering project is late. The reason is simple --
engineering is both science and art, and there's no way to absolutely
predict how quickly inspiration will come when it's needed, how many
weird little problems will show up, etc. AT never even got to that
stage, though, because they never really started the Power Amiga
project. They do have some interesting architecture papers on it...</BLOCKQUOTE>

of course even longer.</CITE> <CITE>So realistically take 2 or 3 (or even more) years into account to
achieve this. I don't think this could be acceptable</CITE>.

<UL>An anonymous person who calls himself &quot;Goat&quot;
writes that people should have some faith with Gateway. He said he has
dealt with them as customer, and that Gateway has a much better customer
support than Commodore ever had. He says that Gateway users are something
of fanatics, much like Gateway, since it's not very normal to ship
computers in boxes marked like cows. He thinks they like fanatism,
since it pays off for them. Concerning people mailing Gateway with
idiotic suggestions, he writes <CITE>I don't think that a few oddball letters mixed in
with a generally sane and enthusiastic lot are going to faze them in
the least</CITE>. <CITE>I just hope that they can keep their sense of humor as they survey the
wreckage that the last four years has made of the Amiga.</CITE>

<UL>Lutz Viewig thinks that the A1200 no longer
suits the market - no matter if it's released in its current form or as
Walker. For playing, there's the cheaper Playstation and for working
there are inexpensive PC clones. He thinks the only explanation for
using the Walker is mad cow disease. [ ;-) ]

<UL>Fred Fish announces a software distribution
agreement. Cronus will provide a complete pOS development environment
on CD-ROM. The CD will be named Geek Gadgets 2 and will be released
in April. It will contain a developers release of pOS, as well as all
necessary tools for pOS development. <CITE>Using these tools, it is possible to write programs that run on both p.OS
and AmigaOS using the same binary file. A shared library that runs on both
operating systems provides applications with all necessary ANSI C and POSIX
support, while special startup code allows programs to determine at startup
whether they are running on p.OS or AmigaOS and make the appropriate system
calls.</CITE>

<UL>Apparently, Justin Case has some a bit

He says that the <CITE>source code was obtained from someone named
^MAX^, he belongs to a rather nefarious group of individuals who
re-distribute their own versions of otherwise commercially available
software</CITE>. That person <CITE>re-wrote it in order to work on the Amiga</CITE>,
and <CITE>he's implemented some features not in the original, and
that are exclusive to that particular port</CITE>. <CITE>^MAX^ is continuing to develop
this version, and is actually planning to completely re-write it in
assembler.</CITE> There is now also an official statement from iD
software on this subject: <CITE>we are aware of a port that was recently written for the Amiga. We
don't condone, nor do we condemn this version. It is not our intention,
at this time, to begin supporting the Amiga, nor in the foreseable
future...</CITE>. But they also say that Amiga users must purchase
the original Quake.

about the company's corporate direction and market segmentation

<CITE>the enthusiast, the major account customer and the consumer</CITE>.
Possibly they are also talking about the Amiga here; either
