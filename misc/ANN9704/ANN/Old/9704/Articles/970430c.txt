Well, Motorola has some tool to convert 68k source into PPC source to
offer already.

You bet. This is an approach when you want to see something at all, soon.
And probably it works only on rather clean original source. The AmigaOS
source is said to use dirty tricks like in the 6502 days, like jumping
into the middle of another statement to save a few bytes in the executable.
Such cases are nightmares for automatic conversion. So you can't do it
completely automatic, much hand fiddling is also needed. And in that very
instant you of course need the guy/people who had done the original,
because only they (hopefully still :-) know what the heck one particular
hack was meant to do.

And please remember that many of the first PC apps were automatically
converted 8080 CP/M apps, which suffered badly in their performance.
When an app was known to be automatically converted, this was a bad
contribution to its reputation.
