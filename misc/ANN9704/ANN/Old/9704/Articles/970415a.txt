I don't get the impression that Gateway plans to integrate the Amiga
development, production and distribution into the existing Gateway
corporate structure.  They own Amiga now, but I don't see them trying
to absorb it into their current operations and product line.

E.g., Gateway's COO didn't say: We're going to enhance our current PC
line by integrating Amiga and PC technologies and system
interactiveness, blah, blah.  What he did say was they just couldn't
let the Amiga technology die.  So you prop up AT, pat Petro on the
head and send him off with a few million buck expense account.

Everything indicates that the Amiga will be
handled by Petro and Amiga Technologies/International.  I wouldn't even be
surprised that the name Gateway doesn't even appear prominently on Amiga 
packaging and ad copy, except as a footnote that AI is a wholly owned
subsidiary.. blah blah.

Sure.  We need to cordially thank Gateway for putting AT/I back in
business.  But all the other stuff -- our hopes likes dislikes fears
dreams needs etc. -- would/will be directed to the old same
place: www.amiga.de.  Petro noted in his recent interview that Amiga
uers were NOT to send their inquiries to Gateway's European offices.
They don't know anything... about the Amiga, that is.  

 And theoretically, these guys at Amiga Technologies/International are 
already quite familiar with the Amiga and hardly need a hand-holding
introduction to the Amiga and what it means to its users.
