Subject ........: Too many MODs on Aminet

Am I alone in my fear that Aminet is becoming over-run with MOD tunes
and not enough software per se?  I just visited Aminet and found well
over 300 new MOD uploads since my last visit.  I mean, is Aminet for
Amiga software or for music?

I move that all MODs should be banned from Aminet immediately.
Does anyone else agree with me, or am I just a damn fool?
