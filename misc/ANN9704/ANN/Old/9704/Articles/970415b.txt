I knew someone would say this.

The difference between Gateway buying the Amiga and Compaq buying Gateway
is this: Gateway was able to get the Amiga in a closed-bidding proceeding
for merchandise and technology that had been lying more or less dormant
for months.

Gateway is an actively traded concern, and a vibrant one at that.  Compaq
would have to pay SO MUCH MONEY as to probably erase any gain they might
get from having Gateway in their stable, so to speak.  Look at what the
stocks did on just the revival of a rumor!  That would happen in spades if
Compaq were to actually try to buy the company.

But I forgot.  Unless there's some hot rumor/conspiracy theory for
everyone to argue about every two weeks, people get bored
