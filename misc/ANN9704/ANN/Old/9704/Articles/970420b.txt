Good luck. For the record, Fourth Level Developments is a bunch of
thieves, plain and simple. They routinely steal from their customer,
either by lying to them about upgrades, or about support down the
road. 

The also cheat their authors. For example, while they published
DiskSalv (which they haven't had the copyright authorization for since
September of 1996), they paid me for only approximately 50 copies.
When they sold DICE, they offered a cheaper version without the
manuals -- seems OIC, the owner of DICE, supplied the manuals and
didn't hear about any of the manual-free sales. 

Avoid these guys at all costs. Tell your friends, neighbors, Romans,
and countrymen. Write the magazines. My fondest wish is to see these
guys go out of business, lose their shirts, and suffer in poverty.
