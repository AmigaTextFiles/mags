What we know is that Gateway has gone on public record saying they will
continue the Amiga line.  They didn't have to do this--in fact, I bet a
lot of industry-watchers would have understood the acquisition far better
if they hadn't said anything about it.

When a real company--one with a real chain of command and a real publicity
machine--goes on public record with something, they usually mean it.  It's
not like one random exec at Gateway was quoted out of context saying "we
want to build Amigas", it's been a part of their official information,
limited though it is to date, about their acquisition.

That is enough for me for the moment, and I think it's the most we can
expect for the time being.
