I tried to make an as acurate as possible translation. As German is not
my native language, there may be still some errors or slight
misinterpretatons.

Gateway2000 buys Amiga Technologies
Interview with Petro Tyschtschenko

On 24.3.1997 the negotiations between the American PC
manufacturer/distributor Gateway2000, Inc. and the liquidator off Amiga
Technologies came to a joyfull end. We asked Petro Tyschtschenko a few
questions on the new situation.

Amiga Magazin: Our best wishes. What are Gateway2000's plans for the
Amiga?
PT: They want to start where we stopped about a year ago. The Amiga has
to be built and sold again. No one plans to use chips, motherboards or
technological know-how for anything else, as for example VISCorp was
planning to do (Put the Amiga technology in settop boxes).
A press-release in accordance to this will be released at the end of
April.

Amiga Magazin: Will the Amiga be available again in the normal way?
PT: Yes. We don't want to setup any mailorder scheme without using the
other outlets: computershops, specialist shops, department stores, etc.

Amiga Magazin: What will the Amiga's future look like, how much will it
cost?
PT: In the near future, the computer will be available in the same
congiguration as it has been before, mainly the A1200. It will cost 698
DM (DFL 780,- US$400,- UKP 250,- , calculations made with current
trademarket figures, no tax-corrections - EB), 998 DM (DFL 1120,-
US$580,- UKP 360,- - EB) including a harddisk. We don't want to let the
price rice, but we won't drop it either.

Amiga Magazin: We all know that the Amiga, in it's current hardware
architecture, can't quite follow the innovations in the current computer
bussiness, but that there are great peripheral developments. Is it
planned to cooperate with these manufacturers and traders in the future?
PT: You say it: we are well aware that the Amiga in it's current
configuration doesn't satisfy the demands of this time. The survival of
the computer however, is due to the developments in the hard- and
software sector by many innovative Amiga companies. Off course we are
planning to have a talk with those competent developers as soon as
possible. But we are convinced that these companies will seek contact
with us very soon.

Amiga Magazin: What function will Gateway2000's German office in
Frankfurt have in the support and distribution of the Amiga? They
concentrate on MS-DOS computers solely, don't they?
PT: It's good that you mention this. Gateway2000 Germany and the
European main office in Dublin have nothing to do with Amiga
International. We want to ask Amiga users, manufactures and tradesman to
abandon any contact, be it by telephone or written.

Amiga Magazin: How do you see the future?
PT: Very bright. Finally there is, with Gateway2000, a strong company
behind the Amiga, which is willing to invest a substantial amount of
money in the computer.

Amiga Magazin: Thank you very much for this conversation.

I hope that this translation will give some more ppl access to this
interesting interview. (I have been juggling a German-Dutch and a
Dutch-English dictionary for about an hour to get the right weight to
certain passages)
I for one am glad to see some reassuring words from Petro himself.

I am in no way willing to accept responsibility for any
mis-interpretations or inaccuracies on my part or the readers part and
any of the consequences.

Cheers, 

Eelke
