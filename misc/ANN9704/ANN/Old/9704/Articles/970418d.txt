                 Note to Amiga Community 

Gateway 2000 is still waiting for the final approval from the German
bankruptcy court to
complete the acquisition of the assets of Amiga Technologies. Gateway
2000 is working
hard to explore how to expand the world of Amiga. 

Amiga International and Gateway 2000 have received many positive
responses from the
Amiga community and wanted to keep the community informed of the
progress of the
acquisition. Amiga International plans on further communications
regarding our strategy
(pending final approval) during a press conference at the World of Amiga
on May 17th
and May 18th in London.
