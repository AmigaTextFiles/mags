Subject ........: No AR buyout issue yet: Explanation

Some time ago, I promised that within hours of the completion of an Amiga
purchase deal, there would be a special issue of Amiga Report.  A number
of people have written to me to inquire as to why there isn't one out yet.

It's because the Gateway deal isn't 100% completed yet.  We've all read
the press releases by now, but until one crosses my monitor that tells me
that the deal is sealed and finished, the issue by all rights will wait.

I just wanted to clear things up--yes, we're watching what's happening
every day, waiting for the news to break.  It just hasn't come to pass
yet.
