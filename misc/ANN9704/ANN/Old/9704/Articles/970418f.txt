You clearly need to listen to some good rock music. And drink some
American beer, which, at least in terms of registered breweries, has
gotten incredible lately, once you look past the top 25 or so
breweries, volume-wise. 

As far as computers go, stagnation eventually breeds complacency.
That's when the underground pulls one over on the establishment. It
will happen. It nearly did with the net -- MS reacted quickly, but
they weren't just caught with their pants down, they were caught naked
with the neighbor's underage daughter. They were off building a
AOL-clone dinosaur, the Microsoft Network, even as dinosaurs like AOL
and CI$ were at least attempting small mammal-hood by incorporating
the real internet in their proprietary systems. This kind of many not
happen this year, or next, but it will again, and they're likely to be
even less prepared than this time around. Remember, IBM used to rule
the computer world, far more completely at the time than MS today.

You should immediately run out and get some Nine Inch Nails CDs. They
should cheer you up just fine :-) Start with "The Downward Sprial" and
"Pretty Hate Machine". The go see David Lynch's "Lost Highway"...
