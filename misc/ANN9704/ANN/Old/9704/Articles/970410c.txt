It was different at the time when Escom took over Commodore. We were
three people at Escom back then building the core of later founded
Amiga Technologies, and I received all the e-mail and heaps of faxes.
It was about 120 mails per day, and most of them were just congratulations
and encouragements, so it was fun and easy to get through them. Some of
course also tried to tell *me* what the Amiga is :-), but they really
tried nicely, so it was also not annoying. Only *very* few of the mails
were annoying, like knowing everything better than everyone else on the
world. But these few didn't hurt. All in all, it was not at all
embarrassing. Before, I also had worried what would flood us, but it
wasn't as bad. So let's hope Gateway makes the same experience currently.

Sure, but in reality you don't have to expect such a big damage as you
seem to worry.
