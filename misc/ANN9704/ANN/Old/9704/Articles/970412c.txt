Subject ........: Getting LucasArts to possibly listen to port a game..

I found out some interesting news awhile back.. LucasArts still has some
old copies of LeChuck's Revenge: The Secret Of Monkey Island 2 left for
the Amiga. They have them in stock (minus the box) but do not sell them
directly through their sales department anymore. They ARE however still
willing to sell them and it is being looked after by one of their product
support guys.

I had been searching for this game for years and was glad when I heard
this. I contacted the guy at LucasArts via e-mail and made arrangements to
buy the game for $10US.  I sent him the money and he sent me the game. The
game worked fine but there was some stuff missing from what he said he
sent (I am now looking into what happened.. more then likely bad postal
handling going from the US to Canada). Anyways I contacted him again via
e-mail and he sent me out what was missing (ie: manual and reference card).
In the process, he had typed up two nice letters, one each for each
shipment. Was very polite and courteous in getting me the game and making
sure it was working properly. Thanked me for my Interest in the older
Amiga games and in LucasArts itself. The e-mails he sent me were very
helpful and nice also. Very good service.

They have more and I would assume for the same price if anyone else is
interested!  This game was recently ranked the third best Amiga game of
all time in the April CU Amiga Magazine in their list of the top 50 Amiga
games of all time.

The thing is, how I came to know about this was that I was looking at the
LucasArts webpage and noticed that they have a third Monkey Island game
coming out called "The Curse Of Monkey Island" BUT that it will ONLY be
coming out for PC clones using Windows '95. I am not sure if it is out yet
but it is supposed to be released 1st or 2nd quarter of '97. I wrote to
them updating them on the events of the Amiga at the time (Escom buying
them out, Amiga Technologies set up, Walker in production, CyberGraphX
software, CyberVision (etc.) graphics cards, AGA now standard, '060
accelerators with the PowerUP boards to come, Amigas still being made and
sold etc.)  While I was at it, I was trying to encourage them to port The
Curse Of Monkey Island to the Amiga. Though there was no yes/no answer,
the guy did say he would forward my letter to the programmer of the game
and the other appropriate people who would make such decisions. I told
them how I owned the original The Secret Of Monkey Island and how I had
been searching for the sequel on the Amiga for years and that it is what all
other adventure games like it on the Amiga has been compared to as it has
set the standard and I commended them on the good work.

Anyways I got a reply from a different person in their organization about
the information on how to obtain the sequel from them. I used this as an
opportunity to FURTHER my quest in getting them to listen about porting
the second sequel to the Amiga.  When I sent off the Money Order to buy
LeChuck's Revenge from them, I ALSO included a letter to be forwarded to
whomever neccessary restating some of my words and thoughts in the
original letter and adding more along with letting them know I just bought
the second game from them and that there would be many more people out
there interested in seeing the third game being ported to the Amiga. A
hand written letter is MUCH better then e-mail. What makes it even better
moreso? They sold a game (still) that is years old and to a platform that
they have long since left. At a time when a new game is coming out.. letters
of encouragement to port it to the Amiga ALONG WITH THE PURCHASE of one of
the older games directly from them in the same game line MIGHT just show
that there is still interest out there from the Amiga platform and for
that game in particular especially.

Think this is a good idea? Anyone wanting to do the same thing and is
looking for the game, contact me about getting the e-mail address of the
guy in LucasArts who handles the selling of old Amiga games.

If you buy from them, you must include a letter stating you want The
Curse Of Monkey Island to be ported to the Amiga also and inform them you
just bought LeChuck's Revenge from them for the Amiga to show support as
well as to enjoy the game.

You can add something now that I couldn't when I initially wrote them. You
can tell them about the imminant release of Myst on the Amiga from
clickBOOM by a licence from Cyan to do so. Tell them what processors will
be supported and that AGA plus CyberGraphX and graphics cards will be
supported. You can also update them on the possible Gateway 2000 purchase (now
in its final stages hopefully). If the Amiga is good enough to run Myst, it
will be good enough to run The Curse Of Monkey Island also. 

This would be a great game to have on the Amiga to show off recent
developments.
