Actually, it was a rehashed rumor when Compaq said they wanted to buy
another direct marketer of PCs, people remembered that there was a Gateway
rumor a few months ago and got all excited again.

I tend to agree with the analysts on this one--I can't see what Compaq
would get that they don't already have.  They're starting up a direct
marketing division as it is.  Would buying Gateway at a massively inflated
price give them what they're trying to build on their own?  I don't think
that's very likely.  Juicy institutional contracts?  Probably not worth
the price.
