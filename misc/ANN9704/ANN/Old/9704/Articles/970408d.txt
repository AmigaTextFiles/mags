Dealing with "Hey, your boxes are cool" or "You forgot to include my Win95
manual" is routine.  Keep in mind that you ARE NOT Gateway's customer as
of today.  You did not buy your Amiga from them and as of today they're
not offering one to you.

: Silence = Death.

My real fear, more than that of people telling Gateway what to do or
ranting and raving fruitlessly, is this:

1.  Gateway may not be set up yet to really handle a bunch of Amiga user
input, much as they'd like to.

2.  Amiga users will inundate them with letters/calls/etc.

3.  Gateway will be overwhelmed and a whole lot of this stuff will never
be dealt with, much as they'd like to.

4.  Amiga users won't hear anything back and will feel they're being
ignored cruelly and will rant and rave about how much they hate Gateway,
when they haven't actually done anything wrong on purpose.

THAT is why I'm lukewarm on the idea of just hitting them with a lot of
unsolicited input.  I'm afraid that it won't be seen by no fault of
theirs, but Amiga users will take out their frustrations at not being
acknowledged on them.
