Who says GW2K is planning anything significant with the 68K
processors. I mean, really, what could they do that's going to play in
any market? Sure, you could get some interest in a $200 A1200, or
maybe something at the A1200 level with an '060. That's about what it
would take to stay on a price/performance curve anywhere near where
RISC and x86 machines are today. But the former would lose money, the
latter is at least a 6-9 month project to do cost effectively. 

Just putting existing models back into production doesn't save the
Amiga. ESCOM did that. You can still buy A1200s and A4000s, but
QuikPak is only selling a few hundred a month, maybe less by now.

A 68K card for the PIOS One is not that complicated, but you're still
talking about at least three months worth of software development,
possibly more, to port the OS to the PIOS One, even with a 68K. That's
conceivable, siimply because you could offer that system much sooner,
as a bridge to the ultimate RISC machine next year. But only GW2K can
do this, it would require changes to Exec and other OS level code to
do at all, much less in three months.
