Really? This was investigated at AT times for the A1200, with not
much success.

Not true *at all*. The A1200 motherboard contains *lots* of chips,
many more than a contemporary PC motherboard, even when you include
the gfx card, and you still don't even have slots. No, the A1200
hardware is comparably *very* expensive to build, no way around it
without totally dumping the Amiga Custom Chips or at least redesigning
them (putting them together in one case, major development undertaking).
The Walker added a lot of functionality, so it also was no candidate
to being producable sufficiently cheaper.

Now this is true.

But you can't purchase such small drives or SIMMs anymore out of
current production, only as surplus parts. This is a real cost problem
for every producer. Same thing goes for 2x or 4x CD-ROMs. No way.
