Here is some examples of the letters and responses that can be seen in the
April edition of The Net magazine.  Most were well presented and provided
a lot of information to not only the staff of The Net but its readers as
well. Misinformation or sarcastic/misinformed comments resulting from lack
of knowledge does not help the Amiga and they need to be corrected.  It is
my opinion that due to the nature of Amiga users knowing more about their
machines, along with knowing a lot about the computer industry itself,
sometimes it is obvious that the people reporting the news do not do their
job properl leading to the users having to correct them. If users don't,
then the wrong image of the machine gets out there. Joanne argues that the
wrong image of the machine or its users is getting out there because of
the Amigans (I hate the term Amigaoids) responses to such mistakes... it
might make us seem like fanatics sometimes but we are just keeping the
reporters on their toes.

I had been off the newsgroups for awhile so I am not sure if this was
brought up or not. I have only been getting caught up over the past few
days.. my apologies if this was already mentioned.

These letters can be found in the e-mail section of the April edition of
The Net magazine...

The first article was entitled "Mad About You" in which a user is actually
praising the magazine.

The second article is called "Mad At You" in which a user is seemingly mad
at the magazine for their good quality when in fact, he is praising the
magazine also.

Then we come to the articles about the Amiga which are entitled..

"Really Mad At You".

The editor starts it off by saying..

"Not since our cover story about sex online (February '96) has anything in
The Net touched a nerve so vehemently as Jon Zilber's two-line answer
("Sure - right after our feature story on browsers for slide rules") to a
letter asking when we'd be covering Internet tools for the Amiga."

The first to be printed was Andre Page's letter in which he talks about
the Amiga Web Directory and says "The unofficial Amiga motto: Just wait
"Two More Weeks".

My letter was printed next but I will reserve to comment on that until
last as what they printed (which was shortened from my original letter so
it could fit) took some of my comments out of context from how I
originally meant them.

The next letter was from Lowry Stiles in which he says..

"Come on.  I seriously enjoy your magazine, yet you put down the best
computer designed for home computing.  The Amiga has always been ridiculed
by PC and Mac users, mostly because of jealously, yet all the innovations
that the Amiga pioneered are just now being incorporated into Macs and
PCs."

Yet another letter printed was from Alexander W. Dorn (whose name you
should recognize from the newsgroups here) in which he states..

"I am surprised that you would give a computer platform such as the Amiga
such little regard, especially in a magazine about the Internet.  Aminet,
the Internet archive of Amiga-specific shareware/PD programs is the
largest archive on the Internet, supporting more software than anything
else like it, for any platform, period."

Another letter was printed from an Atari owner who says "I resent you
putting down operating systems not part of the "computer correct"
tyrants."  He goes on to say how he owns a Pentium 90 with Windows '95 but
he gets most of his pleasure from his Atari 4 Meg, 16 Mhz Graphical
Environmental Management system.

Now for my article (which I just noticed is the longest one of them all..
no surprise seeing as how I wrote them a long letter)... I am going to
post it as it is in The Net and then post how I sent it to them
afterwards. From that you can see how they edited my letter and changed
some of its context even though they got my overall point out.

"For your information, I see more hits on Browser Watch from Amiga Web
Browsers (yes, it does have them) than OS/2 browsers here in Newfoundland,
Canada.  Amiga browsers include Aweb, Ibrowse and Voyager.  There are
commercially sold applications as well as free- or shareware.  There are
major Amiga Web Pages, such as http://www.amiga.de,
http://www.amigasupport.com/quikpak and http://www.omnipresence.com/amiga;
there are even Amiga specific search engines, not to mention newsgroups
and FTP sites.

Finally, the Amiga 1200, A2000, A3000, and A4000 can hook directly up to a
TV or monitor.  Each of these is a compact "keyboard computer" with its
own local storage.  This "set-top-box" was around long before WebTV and
network computers.  Amiga users can take part in everything on the Net.
What isn't supported directly via Amiga software we can use via emulation
from the Macintosh or PC clones, using their software (even Netscape
Navigator).

If using slide rules is this much fun, then everyone should have one!

The response I got from one editor was...

"Slide rules? Thanks for the flattery! Personally I'd liken MS-DOS
machines to broken pencils."

                               John Scheib
                               jscheib@calweb.com

At the end of all the letters about the Amiga, Jon Zilber says this..

"Points well taken.  And for those who may have been offended by the
implication that The Net had not intention of including slide rules in our
pages, check out http://www.ozemail.com.au/~gamers/adavie/slide/link.htm#jokes"

These guys obviously have a warped since of humour and don't mind if it
offends their readers or not.  As a matter of fact a lot of the responses
I have been reading over the months have been negative towards the
magazine, their coverage and how well (badly) their CD-ROMs work with
other computers (namely the Mac).

Now here is my original message I mailed to them... note the differences..

Subject: Amiga compared to sliderules


Dear The Net,

I browse through your magazine at local book stores and a recent letter
posted there plus the response from the editor majorly caught my eye.  The
letter in the February edition was asking if you would be covering topics
on the Amiga more, as it relates to the net, in your magazine in the future.
The response comparing the Amiga to a sliderule was not only uncalled for
but showed a major lack of knowledge and probably bias on the part of your
magazine.  If you plan on providing an overall, unbiased picture of the
Internet and information about it, then comments like that is not the way
to do it.

For your information, I see more hits on Browser Watch from Amiga Web
Browsers (yes, it does have them) then OS/2 browsers.  The Amiga has some
great web browsers such as Aweb, Ibrowse and Voyager for its users to take
advantage of.  A lot of applications are being written for these or to
take advantage of the Internet's capabilities and are being sold
commercially or found either free or via shareware, especially on Aminet
(the world's largest online archive of freely distributable programs for
any computer type).  A company in the US called VIScorp is actively
developing a set-top-box for Interactive TV based on AmigaOS and the Amiga
AGA chipset. There are a lot of major Amiga web pages and Amiga specific
search engines out there in cyberspace, let alone talking about newsgroups
and ftp sites etc. I could go on but to end off, the Amiga 1200 has been
here since '92, it can hook directly upto your TV or monitor and provides
both a NTSC and a PAL video signal (amongst others).  It is a compact
"keyboard computer" with its own local storage.  Other companies providing
Network Computers etc. are talking as if a device that hooks upto your TV and
can access the Internet and the Web is something new.  I have been doing it
for years and so have my friends with their A500s, A1200s, A2000s, A3000s, and
A4000's albeit mostly through their monitors but we have very little
complaints and can take part in everything on the net.  What isn't supported
directly via Amiga software, then we can emulate the Macintosh or PC clones
and use their software (yes, even Netscape Navigator) also.

I end off saying the Amiga 1200 and 4000t is still being produced,
manufactured and distributed here in North America by QuikPak.  If you
want some more information on the Amiga, may I suggest you take a look at
the following web pages: http://www.amiga.de,
http://www.amigasupport.com/quikpak and http://www.vistv.com. 

If using sliderules is this much fun, then everyone should have one!

Now to comment on some changes their editting did to my points..

There addition of Newfoundland, Canada to the beginning of my message made
it seem like Browser Watch was limited to here instead of the whole world 
on the Net.

The talk on commercially sold applications and freeware and shareware made
it seem like I was talking about the computer platform overall, instead I
actually was focusing in on the web browsers and utilities. I wasn't so
mad at this wording getting out. 

I loved how they totally changed my reference to the VIScorp web site and
added the omnipresence web site instead. (Someone there must have been
checking some Amiga stuff out). As a matter of fact all mention of VIScorp
was disregarded in what they published.

They left out my mention of the A500 and the way they stated my words made
it seem like the A2000, A3000 and A4000 could hook up to a TV as standard
when really a modulator/expansion is needed.  It is only the A1000, A500
and A1200 that can hook upto a TV as standard. They also included the big
box Amigas as a compact "keyboard computer" when in fact I had only
mentioned the A500 and A1200.

They compared the computers to a "set-top-box" when it was VIScorp I was
talking about trying to produce a set-top-box from the Amiga technology.

They didn't mention QuikPak and the fact that Amigas are still being
produced, although I understand they had to shorten my letter and get in
on the real focus. They also cut some specifics about the A1200 but its
the same reason.

They also left out the mention of Aminet but this was covered in another
letter that was published.


I know this was long but my point is, that misinformation about the Amiga
cannot go uncorrected. If journalists do not like being corrected then
they should be a bit more careful to research their material and report
the facts more acurately. In these cases any publicity about the Amiga is
good publicity even if it means sometimes that the users take the fall for
it. Hopefully these letters will have an effect on The Net's readers and
influence them to look into the Amiga more.  I already got one e-mail from
a local person (whom I do not know) that read my letter in The Net and
commented that even though he does not own an Amiga, he knows of them and
he felt I was right in making the response I did to them.  I have
encouraged him now (as he told me) to write The Net himself about a topic
that concerns him.

Writing letters to Gateway of encouragement and thanks will not do any
harm for the Amiga. It will show them their press releases are working and
will make them feel better about their purchase of Amiga Technologies. If
people want to make suggestions (not demands) to them and if they do so
in a professional, educated manner and Gateway wants to listen, then it
will show them what the people feel is the market, how the market should
advance and if they have some real ideas, hopefully Gateway won't turn up
their nose but actually listen to us. That is what is needed.
