Thanks. I'm not here claiming to be doing an A\Box. I don't know how
many people Phase V have, but they need about 10 on chips, 2 on systems,
to even start talking about that kind of project. AAA had more on chips,
only me on systems, but we would have added 2-3 more to deliver a final
system based on the AAA chips and my "post A4000" system architecture.

Hey, I missed it too. It's just plain marketing. Down inside you find
the same basic hardware. There might be a few connector differences, the
TransAM now has a Siamese System bundled, the Maxtreme, of course, has
the MacOS (which won't be ready quite as soon as a shippable BeOS).
Primarily it's just a marketing thing.

The Mac 68K architecture was really, really primitive. We used to laugh
at them, I took great pleasure in being able to come out with a faster
machine using the same CPU, even if they gradually kicked our butts on
things like RTG, and thus, graphics chip flexibility. The PowerMacs were
much better, though they're kind of behind the curve these days compared
to what you'd expect on a PClone, or what you'll get on most CHRP
systems I suspect (though again, that's less certain since multiple
companies are involved in CHRP solutions, whereas all PowerMacs and
clones come from the same Apple architectures).

In the sense of high-integration, you're getting custom chips on the
PIOS One. I mean, aside from buffers and simple TTL chips (you know,
under $1.00 stuff), there are only four main chips, and a clock
synthesizer. You'll find more stuff on an A500 or A1200 motherboard (
sure, they do have more of the pieces there too). It's just that PIOS
didn't make these custom chips, other folks did. Intel made one, the
same PCI to ISA bus bridge chip you'll find on many PClones these days.
SMC made one, a Super I/O that does most of the PC ports. The Apple
designed Hydra (made by several chip companies) does basic system glue,
OpenPIC interrupt control (a CHRP requirement), SCSI, and the fast RS-
422 serial ports. Finally, Analog Devices made the sound chip.

Those guys in charge really sabotages the development efforts in the
latter days. We wanted something at least up to the AA specs for the
A3000 graphics. 25MHz 68030 wasn't bad in 1990, that's what Apple had in
their IIci, which sold for nearly twice the price of the A3000. But it
also had 8-bit graphics. Management wouldn't pay the price.

Next came the A4000, which was not anything like what we would have
wanted. In late 1990 I started working on the "A3000+", the first system
that used the AA chips. In addition, I had an AT&T DSP3210 chip in there,
16-bit audio I/O, an audio management chip, other cool stuff. The
software for it was cool, the AT&T chip has its own 32-bit multitasking
kernel, so one task didn't necessarily take it over, like in other DSP
systems. And it did floating point about 10x faster than the '040. 

That's when Ali and Sydnes stepped in, kicked out the management (the
folks responsible for the A500, A2000, and A3000), and installed Sydnes'
folks. These guys had the primary job, it would seem, of making sure Ali
knew the previous management was bad, so they did nothing for six months.
They built the A600, cancelled the A500. Bonehead moves. The A3000+ was
cancelled, my partner on the A3000, Greg Berlin, was told to build
something we called the "A1000jr" (after Sydnes' involvement with the
PCjr), a $1000 ECS machine, supposedly to go out in April of '92. No C=
sales offices would order a single unit, so it was cancelled. Then in
May, the A1000jr was given a partial brain transplant from the A3000+ (
just the AA stuff and Zorro III, no SCSI or DSP), the "cheapest '040
card possible without custom chips", originally made for A1000jr
upgrades, became the A4000's CPU module. Started in May, it shipped in
September, a record for a "new" machine at Commodore. 

Greg and a other guys had worked up a replacement CPU module, more like
what I orginally envisioned when I did the A3000's CPU slot. One chip
would hook the '040 bus to the '030 local bus, and since you had control
and datapath all in one chip, a custom chip at that, whole burst cycles
between the CPUs could be converted at once. So it could run nearly as
fast to A3000 memory as the '030 could, rather than about 1/2 speed like
the A4000 did. Plus, the 64-bit memory bus on-card would be much faster
yet. Also, by virtue of the integration, the CPU didn't have to run at
motherboard bus speed, so 33MHz and 40MHz '040s, or 50/66MHz '060s would
work in the same module. The design was 95% completed and simulated on
the CAD systems, Greg went to management, and they shot it down. This
was something that would have payed for itself in TWO MONTHS of
production. Plus opened up higher performance machines. But they didn't
want to spend the money on a gate array.

Look man, I just want to talk about computers here. I've been around the
nets for nearly 19 years, I know what kind of crap can break loose when
you get off topic too much, and that'll drive me away, simply because I
don't have the time. I'm not afraid of a fight, but I'm only going to
fight the ones I'm really interested in. Right now, that's building a
new computer system (which, I have always believed, also involves a
community, which is why I'm here). I have little time for other stuff --
the wife and kids, a good 3-5 mile run, a few good beers, and at least
two hours of sleep a night, whether I need it or not...

>  I'll wait for the SMP G3 kinda thingy for my personal machine :)

The first G3 is very cool. Well, literally, too, at about 5W, doing the
same work a Pentium Pro or Pentium 2 does per clock tick. We do have a
multiprocessor project starting after the PIOS One is in production, and
we're looking to use cheaper parts than the PPC604 family. Nothing wrong
with them, but we don't want to be another Daystar right now. I totally
subscribe to Be's idea that regular people can benefit from multiprocessing.
On the surface anyway, the first G3 chips look very good for SMP (well,
in the MEI way that the PPC603 family supports, not as efficient as the
PPC604's MESI, but it works).
