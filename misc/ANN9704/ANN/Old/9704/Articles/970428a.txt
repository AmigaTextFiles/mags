Subject ........: Found Amiga 1200 - need OS? Help?!

Hi all,

I am an amiga newbie. Found one in the trash. Yes, in the trash - but I
asked the owner, my upstairs neighbor, and he said it was still running,
just useless to him. Well, I finally hooked it up, and I get a nice picture
of a hand with a KickStart disk.

I take it this is the OS? I don't have it, and the neighbor is out of town
now. Any idea where I can get such a thing?

Thanks fer yer help,

Anoton
