Subject ........: Amiga International & A1200's

Here follows a genuine email from Petro Tyschtschenko. I promise it is genuine, but i suppose you'll have to take my word for it...

>>---Start-----------------------<<

Ben, thank you for your mail.
We will not start again to produce A 1200. 
We still have some A 1200 in stock, which I will continue to sell.
We are open minded for a lot of models for AMIGA International. VisCorp is
out and ESCOM is bankruptcy.....So long live AMIGA under GATEWAY 2000.

We will be back soon with our strategy.

Best regards

Petro Tyschtschenko
