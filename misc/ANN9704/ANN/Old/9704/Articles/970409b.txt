   Hmmm. What if Micro$oft originally intended to buy the Amiga, but 
Gateway got wind of it and picked it up first...like someone finding
out that a highway is going to come through a certain area and buying
up the houses while their still inexpensive. The intent might be to resell
their little purchase with a huge profit. 
  But, Micro$oft, in their annoyance, bought the much less capable Web-TV
and now Gateway is left holding the Amiga "bag".
  Just a thought....
