Maybe you should be checking the pios.de web page.

They just announced three new computers---the transam, the Maxxnet and 
the Keenya.  What weird names though.  They also got pictures of them.

The Transam seems to be a 603e machine running PowerPC AmigaOS (pOS?) 
and BeOS.

The Maxxnet seems to be the Transam with Mac ROMs and MacOS 
compatibility.  I suspect that Maxxnet is a PPCP machine.

The Keenya is a line of MacOS clones based on the Motorola Tanzania
motherboard.

Rgds,

Chris

poser en dfenseur de Windows releve de la plus profonde bassesse. J'ai
honte"  ---  Eric Bernatchez,  "La Presse" newspaper, "Cyberpresse"

"Confronted with his machines irrational behaviour, it dawned upon me 
that taking the position of Windows advocate is of the lowest possible 
ethics. I am ashamed".
