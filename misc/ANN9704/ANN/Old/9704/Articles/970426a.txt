Well, I've seen more of the source than most (I ran the OS department after
1.2 until 2.1) and I have to disagree...

Most of the source to the AmigaOS is in C.  Exec is in assembler, the low
level devices (trackdisk, gameport, input, and so on) are also in assembler,
as are small portions of graphics and intuition, and the filesystem.  The rest
(layers, graphics, intuition, dos, and so on) are in C.

(as an aside, language choice wasn't always performance related;  in many
cases it was more what language the module owner preferred.  That's how the
filesystem ended up in assembler, for instance)
