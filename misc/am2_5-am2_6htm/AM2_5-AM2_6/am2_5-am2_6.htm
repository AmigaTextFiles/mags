<P ALIGN="LEFT">Greetings, all, and a belated welcome to 1998.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, welcome to our special Amiga 4000 Tower review issue. As promised, I put together a multi-part story in an attempt to provide the most comprehensive look possible at the current top-of-the-line Amiga. This rather massive undertaking, which you'll see listed by section in the Table of Contents below, delayed this issue a bit, but I finally pulled it all together, and I hope you find the results worthwhile.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'd like to make a few general notes about AM: contrary to appearances, we have <I>not</I> become a bimonthly magazine. That is, at least not permanently. Since late summer, I have not had a lot of extra time, and it has been difficult to maintain a fairly regular publishing schedule. I fully intend, however, to go back to single-month issues as soon as possible. In addition, for those who have attempted to contact me by e-mail, I apologize for the extremely long delay; I'm somewhat behind on that front, but if I received your message, I will reply accordingly. Please be patient, however, because I currently have to make an hour's trip every week just to access my primary mail account. I hope to change this in the near future.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">But back on the subject of this issue, in addition to the A4000T review, I would like to draw your attention to a reader poll we are beginning this month. It concerns the subject of Amigas and America Online, an issue you may have seen raised periodically in AM in recent months. Contributing Editor Paul Somerfeldt thought it would be beneficial to get feedback from the Amiga community on this subject; if enough people respond, we might actually be able to influence things. For more information, see the poll below in the Table of Contents. It will run throughout the year, but prompt entries will help the most.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Anyway, without further delay, following are the contents of the December 1997-January 1998 issue of The Amiga Monitor: Volume 2, Issues 5 and 6.</P>

<LI><I><A HREF="a4ktintr.htm">Introduction</A></I><BR>

<LI><I><A HREF="a4ktcpu.htm">The Processor</A></I><BR>
What could be more central to a computer than the Central Processing Unit? In this era, the Motorola 68060 stands proudly at the top of its class, but the world is leaving it behind. Or is it...?
<LI><I><A HREF="a4ktchip.htm">The Custom Chipset</A></I><BR>
The CPU may be "central" by name and by function, but we haven't truly examined a new Amiga under the hood until we've looked at the hardware at the heart of the system.
