<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Guidelines for Writing for The Amiga Monitor</H1>
<HR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Amiga Monitor will gladly publish contributions from other members of the Amiga community. There are several guidelines we would like you to follow, however, if you are interested in writing for us.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">There are two types of articles we will accept:</P>




<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">1. Prearranged Articles</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Contact our Senior Editor, Samuel Ormes, by sending an e-mail message to <A HREF="mailto:s.ormes@genie.com">s.ormes@genie.com</A>, in which you express your interest in writing, and briefly explain what type of writing you would like to do.
<LI>A member of the Editorial Staff will respond to your message with information about upcoming deadlines, and a general time frame within which we would be working.
<LI>You would then send us your article, and assuming there are no serious problems, we will publish it. You would be listed for that month in the Staff List as a Contributing Writer.
</OL>




<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">2. Unsolicited Articles</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Amiga Monitor may, at its discretion, choose to publish articles sent to us without any prior contact between the writer and the AM staff. We prefer to have you contact us first, but it is not absolutely necessary. If you do choose to send in an unsolicited article, <B>please remember to include your name and e-mail address.</B> Anonymous submissions will be frowned upon; "pen names" and aliases are acceptable, however.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you do choose to send an unsolicited article, please send it to <A HREF="mailto:MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM">MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM</A>.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><I>A few notes on article submission...</I></H3>

<UL>
<LI>Articles should be written in English.
<LI>Articles should be sent in ASCII format; HTML codes are permissible.
<LI>Images are permissible, and in fact welcomed, as judicious use of graphics can greatly increase the quality of an article. If you do choose to include images, please use IFF, JPEG, or GIF format, and archive your entire article with LhA, LZH, or LZX.
<LI>Personal e-mail signatures, URL's, etc. are permitted to be included in an article.
<LI>Once sent to us, your writing becomes public domain under the <A HREF="reprint.htm">AM Reprint Policy</A> unless you explicitly request otherwise.
<LI>We often count on you to come up with specific ideas for articles. Although you are welcome to get in contact with us simply to announce your interest in writing for us, please do not be surprised if we don't have any specific "assignments" for you right away. It is generally best if those who wish to write know exactly what they want to write about.
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">And lastly,

<UL>
<LI>It is ultimately at the discretion of the staff of The Amiga Monitor as to whether articles will be published.
