There are currently three lists; click on one of the following e-mail links to send a message to subscribe to the list, or send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM (AM List Administrator)">MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM</A> in which you specify the information given further below:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="mailto:MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM (AM HTML List LhA)">HTML LhA</A>
<LI><A HREF="mailto:MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM (AM HTML List ZIP)">HTML ZIP</A>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Important Information</H3>

<UL>
<LI>If you have an account on CompuServe, America Online, or Genie, specify this to have files transferred to you directly. Otherwise, they will be sent in UUEncoded form.
<LI>Please specify the list(s) you would like to join (if you aren't using one of the three links above).
<LI>Although your name is not required, it helps with our record-keeping if you include it.
<LI>The e-mail address to which you would like the files to be sent
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If we successfully receive and process your request, you will receive notification that you have been added to a list. If you do not receive a response within two weeks, please check to see that your correct e-mail address is included with the message, and resend your request.</P>


<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">A Few Notes on the Distribution Lists...</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our Publisher sends the AM archive out through his mailbox enough times each month without it coming in several times as well. Please make his life a little easier, and do your best to prevent bouncebacks:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Please notify us if your e-mail address changes.
<LI>Also, please make sure your provider can handle fairly large attached files. The AM archive currently ranges in size anywhere from 50k to 300k. We can tolerate it if you have problems with some of the larger ones, but if there are consistently problems with smaller archives, we may have to consider finding a different way to deliver the magazine to you.
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Also, if you are one of our AmigaGuide readers, be warned that since our primary format is HTML, there will be a delay in the production of AmigaGuide-format issues (converting HTML to AmigaGuide is not easy, and we have limited resources). We hope to narrow the gap between the release of HTML and AmigaGuide versions, but in the meantime, you should be aware that there is a delay.</P>
