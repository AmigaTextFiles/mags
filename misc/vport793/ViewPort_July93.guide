June was not the kindest of months for Commodore International.  After
announcing a loss of $173 million for the quarter, Commodore's stock
promptly plummeted to a record low.  At least two articles in prominent
newspapers have proclaimed Commodore as being either mortally wounded or
as close to it as a company can get.  And to bring things a little closer
to home for the electronic community, there were layoffs at West Chester.
This made it all too real; people we knew were out of work.

The inevitable followed.  Prophesies of Commodore's imminent demise
abounded, along with the customary retelling of all that Commodore has
done wrong in the last seven years.  The pain was palpable, accompanied
by the gnawing feeling that we were all powerless to intervene.

But what's all the fuss about?  The Amiga is nothing more than a
collection of silicon and copper, hosed in a plastic case.  It's a
servant, an electronic errand boy, and nothing more, right?

I think I can count the number of people who really feel that way on one
hand.  But on the other hand, it's a true statement.  Yes, there are more
than a few of us who know the name of the Father of the Amiga, and even
the name of his late dog.  Some of us even know the maiden name of RJ
Mical's wife, or the original name of the Amiga.  And that, I suspect, is
what makes the Amiga different.

It wasn't designed by a nameless committee.  It didn't even have an easy
birth.  And it had sneaky messages buried in the operating system,
accessible only through a Byzantine series of keystrokes.

And the rumors of its death may have been greatly exxagerated.  After
Commodore reportedly came to terms with the money folks, the stock
rallied and jumped 20% in a single day.  So it appears that there still
is hope, after all.  But that hope, sources say, resides within something
that brings the Amiga full cycle:  a games console.  The CD32,
Commodore's entry into the hotly-contested Games arena, may well carry
with it the future of the Amiga.

May you live in interesting times.  That curse, borrowed from another
culture, seems to perfectly describe the climate in today's computer
industry.  First, IBM announced record losses.  Then Commodore, Dell, and
finally Apple.  Can't anybody here play this game?

Maybe not.  At Commodore, it's the company itself that is fighting for
survival, not the Amiga.  Irving Gould would probably drop production of
the Amiga in a heartbeat if he had any alternative.  It means nothing
more to him than numbers on a ledger sheet.  And Apple is adrift,
watching their newly-captured market share being won back by the Intel
behemoth. IBM, Compaq, Dell, and countless others are learning that
prospective customers care more about the appellation "PC" or perhaps
"Intel Inside" than they do about the name that precedes it.  It's a
sorry state of affairs, and it just may get worse.

WANTED:  A group of visionaries who have the capability to shape the face
of computing, define the cutting edge, and pursue the vision.  Must be
willing to start immediately.  The alternative?  Memorize the phrase
AUTOEXEC.BAT and repeat until your brain stops functioning.

                    Math Tools for Creative Graphics
                           by @{" Sylvia Lutnes " link Syl}

I used to be good at math - I actually got an A in calculus in college -
but that was (((1*3)*10^2)+(6*7)) moons ago. I can still add and
subtract, but understanding wpix(px,py,min(rpix(px,py)+1,31)) seems a bit
beyond me these days. MathVision 2.4 allows you to explore math through
visual representation of functions. But if you, like me, don't have the
time to spend in REALLY figuring out what's going on, you can still
derive great pleasure from this complex program and create pictures for
use as @{" backdrops " system "WDisplay VPort:weave"} and brushmaps in other programs.

Many formulas/functions are included with the program and you can load
them up and change numbers, change SIN to COS, change resolution and
palette, or do whatever you'd like to create variety in the output
without even understanding the underlying structure. MathVision 2.4 has
AGA support, can save IFF24 pictures, and understands ARexx. Its
interface is direct and easy to get used to, though you really do need to
read the documentation to understand viewers and colors and hooks and
basically just what is going on. It uses Doug's Color Commander as its
palette tool, which is fascinating to play with but takes some time to
master.

There are other ways to make pretty pictures besides choosing the math
behind it and waiting for the finished product. MathVision allows you to
make brushes that are actually formulas in disguise. You can paint with a
mathematical brush as you would an IFF brush in DPaint. This is loads of
fun. In fact MV supplies a 'front-end' that has some of these brushes
already made up for you. Click the mouse-button and there's a spiral,
choose another brush and there's fireworks.

MV can build anims with included utilities and do wipes and warps and
morphs (though the morph tool will only be sent upon registration). I
received one of the first non-beta releases and there was a letter
included telling me to register because there are still some ARexx
scripts and complete documentation that will be sent to registered users.
For now, there is just a 2.4 addendum to the spiral bound manual.

I had few problems with MV, except for its complexity. One major
annoyance is that AGA pictures saved out of MathVision often crash
Viewtek, crash DOpus, in fact crash the Amiga when you try to view them.
The workaround for now is to load them into AdPro/MP and save them out
again. DPaint loads them fine but ignores whatever is in the IFF file and
writes it back out the same way. I'm sure this will be addressed soon.

MV is an extremely powerful tool. If there's any aspect of the output you
wish to control you can. Of course, the best use will be made of the
program if you approach it from the mathematical side. There is enough in
here, however, to please even the math klutzes of the world who have a
bit of time and patience.

                             by @{" Sylvia Lutnes " link Syl}

From the documentation for Lyapunovia1.5: "If the Mandelbrot set is the
'most complex object in mathematics', Lyapunov Space must be the
juiciest, spiciest and most outrageous object ever found within numbers."
I agree. Lyapunov pictures are an artist's dream...or nightmare,
depending on your tastes. In one evening of playing with this program I
came up with a dozen pictures I want to use in Imagine.

Lyapunovia1.5 is a shareware program by Jesper Juul of Denmark. This
commercial quality program supports all Amigas and processors (1.3
through 3.0) and even has a version for non-accelerated Amigas that have
a co-processor. Strict adherence to Commodore's style guidelines is
maintained and if you're running 2.1 or better you can even use the
screenmode requester to choose resolution and color depth.  You can set
the priority of the program from its menu...a feature I wish more
programs had. The documentation is thorough and comes in both ascii and
.guide formats.

Pictures can be generated in most Amiga modes, including 256 color AGA,
and saving as 24-bit is supported. This program is extremely easy to use
because the Lyapunov 'formulas' are not difficult to play with. There are
dozens of formulas included, and with the ability to zoom with the mouse
you may never have to enter a formula at all.

The many included 16, 32, and 256 color palettes are amazingly beautiful
and can change your finished picture in a heartbeat into something that
looks totally different. Color cycling is supported, but be careful!  You
may find yourself spending as much time staring at walls of moving lava,
intricate space needles and shimmering @{" web things " system "WDisplay VPort:lyapc"} as generating new
pictures.

@Node CED

                          Cygnus Ed (CED)
                         by @{" Kevin Ferlazzo " link Kevin}

Cygnus ED (CED) v3.5 is a full-featured text editor designed for
high-performance text entry.  It provides many of the basic features that
you expect in a word processor, but without giving up speed and ease of
use. @{" CED " system "WDisplay VPort:CEDscreen"} really shines as a programmer's editor, which makes it extremely
useful.  Included with CED are three other programs to make life easier:
ED (an optional front-end for CED), MetaMac (a macro editor), and
RecoverCEDFiles (for when Mr. Murphy strikes).  Also included are several
useful ARexx scripts.

CED runs on any Amiga using WB 1.3 or later, with at least 512K of
memory. For best utility, I recommend more memory, and a hard drive.  I
recommend this because of my tendency to open _lots_ of CED editor views
(a major convenience, by the way).  CED runs from either the CLI/Shell or
from Workbench.  ARexx support is built-in, allowing the user to write
scripts to automate any function in CED they want to.

CED is instaled via the Commodore Installer program, which makes it a
breeze to do.  Of course, make a backup of the CED distribution diskette
first, and then install from the backup.  Remember Mr. Murphy.

CED is now fully localized under WB 2.04 and up, with Locale file support
for English and German (Deutsch) provided.  CED uses the ASL system
standard file, font, and screen mode requesters under WB 2.04 and up.

---- Using CED ----

Using CED to edit your User-Startup, read a capture file from your
favorite online service, or write letters to Mom is easy.  From
WorkBench, select the icon for CED (or ED) and then <shift-click> on the
icons of the files you want to edit.  Or, from a CLI or Shell, type in
"ED filename" and CED will load the file you refer to (sans quotes, of
course).  Loading multiple files at once is easy; just type in "ED
filename1 filename2 filename3", etc.

A separate CED view opens for each file.  A view is that portion of a
file on the screen at any one time.  Each view has its own title bar,
display area, and (if you want) a scroll bar, with each view controlled
independently of any other view.  Just scroll to where you want to begin,
and start editing.  Views stack one on top of another (you can't have
views side by side).  In fact, CED allows you to have so many views that
it can get downright confusing!  The maximum number of views that CED
allows is up to 30 on a screen (or only as many your screen height will
allow), but CED allows you to spawn additional CED screens, each of which
can have 30 views.

All the functions you would expect of a first class text editor are in
CED, including cut and paste, search and replace (with history!),
auto-saving, background printing, macros, ARexx support, and undo.  Other
useful options are fixed-width font support, word wrap, centering lines,
opening on any public screen (under WB 2.04 and up only), and skipping
from one token (defined as a parenthesis '( )', bracket '[ ]', brace '{
}' or C comment mark '/* */') to its matching token.

A key feature of CED is that it supports both independent and cooperating
views, where 'independent' views are of different files, and
'cooperating' views are of the same file.  Using cooperating views allows
you to, for instance, have a function call and its definition on your
monitor simultaneously, even if they are at opposite ends of a huge file.

CED allows you to have multiple configurations, for different types of
files.  For instance, when editing C source files I use one set of macros
and tab settings.  When editing .doc or .txt files I use wholly different
macros and settings.

The ARexx capabilities of CED have been enhanced from earlier versions,
and previous owners of CED will be greatly pleased to hear that the
manual has been completely rewritten.  :) CED has over one hundred ARexx
commands (described in over 45 pages in the manual).

The macro abilities of CED have been greatly enhanced over earlier
versions, giving users the ability to create macros that will enter data
into any of CED's requesters.  So, for example, you can create a macro
that will enter into a search requester text that you have marked, and
then execute the search for you.

---- MetaMac ----

MetaMac answers a problem that earlier versions of CED had.  While CED
always allowed users to enter macros, it was impossible to edit them
without re-entering them from scratch.  MM is a stand-alone macro editor
that allows you to edit or create CED macros.  MM opens two windows on
the WorkBench, one that contains a listing of the macros saved in a
particular configuration, and one that shows you what commands the
selected macro contains at present.  MM allows you to put into your
macros virtually all the menu functions of CED, simply by selecting them
off MM's menus (CED menus are duplicated within MM).

MM and ARexx together allow CED to emulate virtually any other editor
available on the Amiga.  For instance, MM can bind to the sequence
<Ctrl-k><Ctrl-b> the command to start marking text.

---- RecoverCEDFiles ----

RecoverCEDFiles allows you to recover files that would have otherwise
been lost to a guru, recoverable alert, or a software failure.  After a
warm-boot, RCF searches all system memory looking for files that CED was
editing at the time of the crash.  If it finds a file in memory, RCF
reports which file it found, the file size, and how many changes had been
made to the file between the time it was last saved and the crash.  If
you wish to save it, a standard CED file requester saves the data.  RCF
should be run immediately after warm-booting your Amiga, in fact, the
best strategy is to interrupt the boot by using a <Ctrl-d> and then run
RCF! In combination with CED's Auto-Save abilities, it becomes very
difficult to lose important files that you are editing.

CED was written by Mr. Bruce Dawson, of CygnusSoft Software, and is
available now from ASDG, Incorporated.  List price of CED v3.5 is
$119.95, but previous owners may upgrade for only $35.

                      Migraph Colorburst Hand Scanner
                                by @{" Nick Cook " link Nick}

The ColorBurst is Migraph's new color hand scanner for the Amiga. To use
it, you'll need at least 2 megs of RAM, and WorkBench 1.3 or higher.
Migraph recommends an accelerated machine, 4 megs of RAM and a hard
drive. The package includes the scanner, power supply, interface box, and
the software program ColorKit.

ColorBurst scans from 50 to 400 dots per inch (dpi) in five modes:
 o Super Color (SCG), which reads up to 262,144 colors (e.g., the
   new AGA modes, although non-AGA machines can employ this mode)
 o Color (SC), which reads up to 4096 colors (the original HAM mode)
 o Monochrome Grey (MG), which reads true 64 resolution greyscale
 o Dithered Color (D), which reads 8 colors and uses one of three
   dither patterns to create the color image
 o Monochrome Text (T), is used for black and white art work and
   text

Installing ColorBurst is not difficult, but it is different than
Migraph's black and white scanner. While the latter could function
through a switch box, the former cannot. ColorBurst's interface box must
be plugged directly into the parallel port. This can be performed with
the Amiga's power on without frying any chips, according to the manual.
(I haven't tried that yet. Call me chicken.) The direct port access is
somewhat of a hassle, but the interface is attached to its plug via a
short length of ribbon cable. At least you don't have to wrestle your
Amiga around to get clearance for the three inch length of the interface
box. The power supply and the scanner are plugged into the interface.

The hefty scanner comes in a flat black case, with two sets of switches
on either side to control scan mode, pattern, DPI, and contrast. The
button to start a scan is on top, a somewhat inconvenient spot when
compared against its "thumb" location on the side of Migraph's black and
white scanner. Given the need for the interface to plug directly into the
Amiga, the scanner comes with a 5 foot connecting cable. A window allows
you to position materials accurately. The scanner's 5 inch head is a
different size than the black and white unit, so it won't fit the
templates for products such as the Scan:Align tray or Migraph's own
MergeIt tray.

The color unit requires different care and feeding than the black and
white scanner. ColorBurst incorporates a fluorescent scanner lamp which
must be warmed-up for at least two minutes at the start of a session, and
for at least 30 seconds prior to any scan. A progression bar counts down
the 30 second warm-up time whenever "Scan" is selected. You can abort
this warm-up period if you wish by a button click. Unfortunately, the
scanner does not automatically shut off. Once the lamp comes on, it stays
on until the scan sequence is performed: click on scan button, then hit
any key on the Amiga. If you forget to do this, and leave the lamp on for
longer than 10 minutes, the scanner overheats and affects image quality.
A software "nag" feature would be handy.

ColorKit software installation is a snap. An icon driven script places
Migraph's fonts in the appropriate library. The program is copied by
simply dragging the icon to its destination. The software is a front end
for the scanner only, and lacks the paint and processing functions of its
sister program, TouchUp. The uncluttered interface consists of only four
icons, other than the quit and depth gadget. These icons also have
keyboard equivalents.

Scanner settings for mode, DPI and length are selected by clicking the
second icon's requester. The mode and DPI settings must match the
switches on the scanner, otherwise especially ugly images result.
Unfortunately, the software does not read the scanning unit's settings.
The user must make the settings manually on both the scanner and
software. Since some modes, such as SCG, suck up memory faster than
Dracula in a bloodbank, the Scan Setting requester provides a listing of
currently available RAM, as well as how much RAM is needed. This allows
you to make any adjustments prior to attempting the scan.

You may be initially surprised to see a blank screen after completing a
scan. This is because ColorKit is waiting for specific instructions on
how to display the raw data. Based on the scan mode, the program offers
quite a few options beyond paper or plastic:

       o Hires or Lores, Standard or Overscan
       o Interlaced or not, NTSC or PAL
       o 2, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 256 (AGA) colors
       o HAM-6, HAM-6 CR (or "crunched"; this option discards
         every other horizontal pixel to get the picture square again)
       o For AGA machines, HAM-8
       o 16 greyscale for all Amigas, 256 Grey for AGA Amigas
       o Error correction, and High quality (for AGA) is also available.

After selecting display options, ColorKit reduces colors, constructs
histograms, and creates the image on the screen. Time to get a cup of
coffee. On my A3000, a HAM-6 picture took approximately a minute and a
half to complete. On slower machines, go get a cup of coffee and watch
Oprah. The manual contains several references to speed and processors.

How did the displays look? On my stock 1084S monitor, not bad. The
greyscale is excellent. Scanning color pictures and reducing them to
black and white images used to remind me of a hillbilly stuffed into a
too-small- suit: more information than the package can hold. With the
ColorBurst, however, scanning color images in greyscale results in an
excellent quality image, almost as though the original was in black and
white. The HAM-6 CR does not distort the image. HAM-6 still tends to
fringe, and the color reduction casts a tint to the image. For example, a
scanned photo of a model standing in a meadow rendered a greenish tinge
to the model's skin tone. The display function certainly shouldn't be
used as conversion software, either. If you want proof, just display a
HAM image as Lores 32 color. Looks like the latest VGA to LORES game
conversion, huh? The manual recommends the Dithered color setting only if
you find yourself in a low memory or limited disk space situation. This
is for good reason: the dithered images are flat ugly.

A number of options are available when saving a file. Along with the
selections outlined above, a SCG image can be saved as 24 bit. Not that
ColorKit is somehow vaulting over hardware, but rather the 18 bit SCG
image is stored in a 24-bit database. This permits the scanned image to
be imported into programs such as ADPro or ImageMaster for further image
processing. Other aspects of the image, such as X/Y offset, width,
height, and saving the full image versus the screen, can be altered.

A ColorKit bug pops up in the save function: you play hide-and-go-seek
with the file requester. After setting the save parameters, and clicking
OK, a grey screen covers the lower three fourths of the image. I assume
this is the background for the file requester. Except the requester is
AWOL. By toggling to the Workbench screen (left Amiga M), you'll find the
file requester patiently waiting. It works normally, but after you save
your image, you need to flip the screen back into ColorKit (via left
Amiga N). According to Migraph, this is due to a bug in the Commodore's
ASL, and won't occur if your running Workbench 2.1/3.0. A ReadMe file
notes that two feature - - scrolling the image with the mouse and
multiple error correction/dither choices - - are not implemented in this
version. A ColorKit update which fixes these bugs and offers new features
is promised in July.

The 52 page, indexed manual gets the job done; its organized well and the
writing is not too obtuse. It would have been nice, though, to provide
the Resolution Settings chart on either a separate reference card or on
the last page of the manual. Currently it sits on page 23, requiring you
to thumb through the manual when setting up a scan.

ColorBurst is a flexible unit, useful for DTP, OCR, and to a lesser
extent, in video or multimedia. The ColorKit software, although lacking
the power of TouchUp, is adequate for getting an image into your Amiga. I
have had no complaints with Migraph's customer service over the years
I've dealt with them (they've phoned me after I've sent in bug reports).

                   Visionaire-A Morphing Alternative
                            by @{" William Graham " link Bill}

Amiga users have the luxury of being able to choose from several 2D
morphing programs. However, this type of software is no longer causing
the level of excitement it did when first released. 2D morphing is
accepted as a standard tool for videographers, animators, and those
people developing multimedia applications. Though the excitement has died
down a bit, almost everyone agrees that this type of software has
unleashed a fresh new wave of creativity. It is, for the most part, easy
to use and understand, and does not have nearly the steep learning curve
that 3D graphics and animation have, for example.

So yet another 2D morphing program is not about to make cover stories for
Amiga magazines, one would think. "After all," the jaded Amiga artist may
say, "so there's another 2D morphing program.  You've seen one, you've
seen them all." You already own one, maybe two, they work pretty much the
same, save maybe for some minor qualitative differences. They all seem to
cost less than $200. They all are (usually) bundled as part of another
image processing program.

But there is another kid on the block. It is indeed another 2D morphing
program, and works similarly to the others, at least at first......

Visionaire. A 2D morphing program from Impulse,Inc. Visionaire was
written in Brazil, where it is known as MorphOs (not to be confused with
MorphUs, also available from Impulse) and was written by Bruno Costa and
Lucia Darsa. Impulse is marketing the product in the U.S.

Visionaire does indeed have the standard From and To windows. It will
handle the three basic types of morphing, warping a still, morphing one
still to another, and morphing one sequence of frames to another sequence
of frames. Editing is accomplished by moving the points of a grid
superimposed over the images. Visionaire does support AGA, in both
editing and output. For ECS users, you have the choice of on-the-fly
greyscale (8 level) conversion of your images, or hi-res color (16
colors) conversion that change to accommodate the image you are working
on when editing. Output is either 24 bit IFF or standard Amiga
resolutions. Impulse's proprietary format, RGB8, is NOT supported.

Visionaire ships with an outstanding 175 page manual, that, aside from a
very few typos, is as clear and understandable as any software manual I
have seen. Obviously, it was not written by Impulse. There are some very
fine tutorials, along with a nicely written index. Visionaire is not copy
protected, and ships with two disks, the program disk and an example/
tutorial disk. Hard drive installation is effortless.

Although Visionaire is a 2D morphing program, and though the interface
seems very similar to other software of that type, there are some very
big differences. The first and most important is the use of Mixers.
Mixers are a way of controlling the rate of morphing in a sequence of
images. Mixers are used for both Color and Shape morphing, which can be
handled separately in Visionaire. Furthermore, each and every editing
point can have its own separate Mixer for both Color and Shape. This
means that you have complete control over the progress of the morph for
every part of the image. You can, for instance, in a morph between two
faces, have the nose morph first, then the mouth, then the rest of the
image. Or you could have eye color morph before the shape of the eyes
themselves.

Mixers are very simple to use. They are represented on screen as a box
with a horizontal and a vertical line in the middle. The horizontal axis
represents the output frames from left to right, and the vertical axis is
the percentage of transformation with the bottom being all From image,
top being all To image. Overlaid is a diagonal line (the default) from
bottom left to upper right. This third line is actually a type of spline
or curve that can be manipulated much like those in a structured drawing
program. The shape of the curve determines the "bias" of the morph for
that area. Color and Shape mixers work identically. There is a global
Color and Shape mixer as well. Mixers can be copied from one area to
another, and saved for reuse. The "border" between Mixer areas is
smoothly interpolated. The Mixer tutorial has you morphing a woman to a
cheetah, using Mixers to have the woman's hair linger for a few frames on
the cheetah, resulting in a mindblowing morph. The ability to micro-
control all parts of an image, or sequence of images, in time during a
morph has to be experienced to be appreciated. The rendered output is as
good as any I've seen, and is quite fast, depending on the number of
mixers in use, as well as number of editing points.

Visionaire also supports the use of a sequence of greyscale pictures that
are used as Alpha channels. In this way, it is possible to render 2 or
more morphs, then composite them together through alpha channels.
Similarly, you could mask several sequences of images together also.

As with other 2D morphing software, Visionaire will morph two different
sequences of images. If you've ever tried this, you know it takes a lot
of work. It takes a lot of work with Visionaire also, but some help is
provided through the use of the keyframe concept. If you're working with
two sequences of 100 frames each, for instance, you do not have to edit
the mesh for each and every frame. You can edit every 5th, or 10, or
whatever provides the best results. Visionaire will smoothly interpolate
the "in between" frames. Some other morphing  programs support a keyframe
concept also, but with Visionaire there is one major difference. The
keyframes of the two sequences DO NOT have to be the same!! This is real
morphing power, folks! Keep in mind the Mixer concept when imagining the
kind of morphing you can do here!

ARexx support is extensive, with 77 commands, including the ability to
modify Mixers. Visionaire comes with several scripts that can be called
from within the program. ARexx scripts can also be assigned to F keys,
thereby automating many processes.

Visionaire is completely configurable, from screen colors used to
hotkeys. All in all this is a very nice piece of work. I have had a few
crashes, but I suspect my PP&S '040 may have something to do with it. My
local dealer sells Visionaire for $149.00. If you are a registered
Imagine user, you can get it for $59.00, a super deal. Even with the
occasional crash I would have to recommend this to the Amiga artist who
wants to expand their creative options.

                               DOpus Tricks
                               by @{" Jim Meyer " link Jim}

Directory Opus - DOpus, to old friends - is by far the most popular
directory utility ever released for the Amiga.  With a powerful set of
built-in commands, an ARexx port, and almost infinite configurability,
DOpus provides an alternate workplace, one that is unique for each user.

As powerful as DOpus is, however, it can be a bit intimidating.  Some
users go through the basic steps of configuration and stop there, using
DOpus only as a souped-up directory utility.  It can be much more than
that, though.  All you need to do is learn a few of the basics.  With
that in mind, I'll tackle some of the most frequent requests for DOpus
scripts.

Question:  How can I get DOpus to sort directories differently?  I don't
always want an alphabetic sort; sometimes I want files listed by date or
size, but I don't want to change the default each time.

Answer:  The key is the MODIFY command.  This command lets you change the
manner in which most DOpus commands operate, either permanently or
temporarily.  In this case, we need to change the sort method.  The
command to do this is MODIFY SORTMETHOD.  We'll create a series of
buttons that let you change to any of 4 sort methods.

1 - Open the Configuration screen, and select Buttons.

2 - When the Button bank screen displays, click on an empty button.  If
there aren't any, select the next bank.  This brings up the @{" Edit Button " system "WDisplay VPort:dopus1.pic" }
screen.  If you need any help at this point, click on the question mark
at the top of the screen.

3 - Give the button a name in the Name field (like DateSort, for the
first example), and click on New E ntry. The Command Entry gadget will
become active.

4 - We're using DOpus commands for these examples.  The Command Entry
gadget should come up with "Command" as the active mode, as opposed to
AmigaDOS or ARexx.  If not, click on the gadget until it reads Command.

5 - Now, enter the actual commands.  After each command is entered, hit
Return and click on New Entry to enter the next command.  For the first
example, Sort by Date, you'll need the following commands: (Note that
COMMAND refers to the mode; do NOT type it!)

COMMAND Remember COMMAND Modify SortMethod -1 3 COMMAND Rescan

The first command, Remember, tells DOpus that this is a temporary
modification.  The second command uses two arguments to tell DOpus that
this operation is to be performed on the active window (-1) and that the
SortMethod should be changed to DateStamp. (3)

NOTE:  The second parameter indicates the number of the sort item in the
configuration list (Operation, List Format) DOpus keeps.  If you have the
items listed in any order other than the default, the 3 will refer to the
fourth item in the list.  (The list starts at 0.)

Use the same template to create buttons for sorts based on size,
filetype, and name.  Just change the second parameter in the Modify
SortMethod command.

Now that ViewPort is available in an AmigaGuide version, you might want
to give DOpus the capability to automatically detect .guide files and
take the appropriate action.  Since AmigaGuide files always begin with
'@database', we can define a new file class.  Again, bring up the
configuration editor.

1 - Select Filetypes.  This brings up the @{" Filetype Configuration " system "WDisplay VPort:dopus2.pic"} screen.
You'll see a list of filetype actions; these are predefined commands
given to DOpus when you invoke the "auto" function by double-clicking or
click-m-clicking on a file name.  (There are other ways to invoke this
function; consult your DOpus manual.)

2 - We want to add an entirely new class, so select New... from the
Classes menu.  This brings up the "file class edit" screen.  It may look
blank and formidable, but that's just a ruse.  DOpus provides a lot of
help for you. At the top of the screen, you'll see a gadget labeled "File
viewer."  This is useful if you don't know how to identify a particular
file type; click on the gadget and a file requester will display.  Use
the requester to locate the type of file you want to define, and DOpus
will display it for you, in hex or decimal.  If you select an AmigaGuide
file, for example, you'll see that it begins with @database or @Database.

3 - Armed with this knowledge, we can proceed.  Give the file class a
name (AmigaGuide is fine) and a file ID (GUIDE will do).  These are just
identifiers for your use.  The names aren't critical.

4 - Now, we have to tell DOpus how to find this kind of file.  Click on
the New Entry button, near the bottom of the screen.  DOpus will create a
line for you, starting with the word MATCH.  This is the default action.
There are others, but we want MATCH.

5 - Click on the text gadget just above the row of buttons.  This is
where you'll type the phrase that DOpus will look for to identify this
file class.  Type @?atabase.  The question mark allows DOpus to match
either "@Database" or "@database".  Since this search is case-sensitive,
we want to allow for both possibilities.

6 - Click on OK.  You'll be returned to the Filetype configuration
screen. The filetype is now defined, but there's no action to go with it.
To add an action, click on the New button and select the filetype you've
just defined.  When the next screen displays, select an event from the
Events... gadget.  I find Double-click to be the most convenient, but you
should choose whatever suits your style.

7 - We're almost home.  Click on the New Entry button.  DOpus will supply
you with the default mode, Command.  We don't want that, though. Click on
the mode selector gadget until it reads AmigaDOS.

8 - Type "AmigaGuide {f}" in the string gadget.  If AmigaGuide is NOT in
your normal search path, supply the full path name.  For example,
SYS:Utilities/AmigaGuide {f}.

9 - Click on OK.  When the Filetype configuration screen displays, select
Save from the Configure menu.  And that's all there is to it!  You can
now invoke AmigaGuide automatically whenever you double-click (or take
whatever action you've defined) on an AmigaGuide file!

Once you get DOpus configured to your liking, you may find yourself
spending more time in DOpus than in Workbench.  This doesn't mean that
you have to give up the amenities of the Workbench screen, though.  Any
program that will open on a public screen can open up on a DOpus screen.
For this example, we'll create a button that opens a Shell on a DOpus
screen.

1 - Call up the configuration program and select Buttons.  Pick a
conveniently empty button and click on it.

2 - Give the button a name and click on the New Entry button.

3 - Click on the Mode gadget until it cycles to AmigaDOS.

4 - All of the magic is contained in the window specification.  The
template for the NewShell command is:

 NEWSHELL [<window specification>] [FROM <filename>]

 The template for <window specification> is:

 CON:x/y/width/height/title/options

The options are the tricky part.  If you want to open a shell on a public
screen, you must use the SCREEN option.  (And, according to Andy Finkel,
the SCREEN option must be last, due to a bug in the NewShell command.)
So, to open a shell 10 pixels from the left, 10 pixels from the top, 300
pixels wide, 100 pixels high, with a title of DOpusShell and a close
gadget, you would use the following command:

 AmigaDOS  NewShell CON:10/10/300/100/DOpusShell/CLOSE/SCREEN{p}

Note that you don't type AmigaDOS; DOpus supplies that for you.  The {p}
in the command line instructs DOpus to enter the name of its public
screen.

5 - That's all there is to it.  Click on OK, and select Save from the
Configure menu.

Of course, you don't have to run DOpus as a separate screen.  You can run
it as a Workbench window, and you can change between configurations at
will.  All you need is one more button!  Here's the commands for two
buttons to change DOpus from opening on a full-length Workbench clone
screen to a half-height window on Workbench itself, and back.

1 - Call up the Configuration editor one more time, select Buttons, and
pick an appropriately blank button.

2 - We'll use a DOpus command this time, so make sure the Mode gadget is
set to Command.  The commands to instruct DOpus to reopen as a
half-height window ON the Workbench screen are shown below.  Remember,
COMMAND is supplied by DOpus; don't type it in.

 COMMAND Remember
 COMMAND MODIFY ScreenMode 1
 COMMAND MODIFY ScreenFlags 4
 COMMAND Redraw

The first line instructs DOpus to remember its current state.  The second
line tells DOpus that we want it to open on Workbench's screen.  The
third line calls for a half-height screen, and the last command caused
DOpus to close and reopen in the new configuration.

Because we used the Remember command, we can return to the previous
setting with these two commands:

 COMMAND Restore
 COMMAND Redraw

However, you should note that Restore will cause DOpus to revert either
to the settings as of the last Remember command, or - if no Remember
command has been issued - to the default settings.

As you have seen, getting DOpus to do what you want isn't difficult.  The
instructions tend to be simple and brief.  In fact, the hardest part can
be finding the information in the manual, which is woefully short on
examples.  But once you get over the initial hurdle, you can begin to
exploit the full potential of DOpus.  And that's when the fun really
starts!

                  Amiga Artists Continue To Impress Me!
                           by @{" deb Christensen " link deb}

Some people will scoff at you when you suggest that a computer is another
art medium, like oils, watercolors, pastels, or any other number of
traditional artist's tools.  And if all they have ever seen are scanned
pictures of photographs, they might be right in thinking that.

However, this is Amiga Territory now, and I think we have every right to
be proud of the incredible pictures being created on Amigas.  While there
is always someone who wants to look at the latest scanned picture of a
half naked woman, the real art going on is being done by Amiga artists,
each with their own style, each one bringing their own interpretation to
the screens that we see.

I don't know how many times I have said it, but ANYONE can scan a
picture. It takes talent to draw one.  It seems to me that the talented
ones seem to own Amigas.  Amazing coincidence, hmmmm?

With that in mind, I'd like to highlight some of the EXTRAORDINARY and
AMAZING pictures which are featured in Library 19 of the *StarShip* from
recent files.  And I'd like to encourage everyone to look at these,
because this _is_ what Amiga talent is all about.  You will be impressed.
Your friends will, too!

Towards the middle of May, P.MORAWIEC uploaded an extremely large
collection of pictures from the European "GATHERING" in Norway.  Like
many of you, I looked at the filesize, groaned, and put it off for a week.

Oh, was I sorry I tarried in looking at them.  These were INCREDIBLE.

There are *6* pictures in that one file, which I've gone and uploaded
separately, I thought they were so good.  Let me tell you about them...

Number: 20086  Name: THE_DRYADS.LZH             File Size:   75136
   TheDryads.iff is a fantasy scene of three tree spirits, Dryads,
   beautifully created and tastefully wrapped around the trunk of the
   tree.  Remember now, Dryads don't care much about clothing, so these
   three ladies are kind of nude.  If that offends you, skip this file
   and get the OTHER selections from the GATHERING pictures.

Number: 20084  Name: SILKWORM.LZH               File Size:   89856
   She stands victoriously over a great slain worm.  This is like no silk
   worm you have ever seen, more like one from some DM's nightmare!  It is
   our good fortune that this brave warrior-woman was up to the task, and
   wasn't killed by the large beast.

Number: 20082  Name: PENCIL_DRAGON.LZH          File Size:   26240
   This dragon has been inked by the artist, and the pen lays there on
   the pad.  A portion of the dragon has already been painted, in fact.
   Unfortunately for our artist, he started painting the HEAD of the
   dragon FIRST, and well, it came alive!  You will notice there is no
   sign of the artist ANYWHERE in this picture!

Number: 20080  Name: FREAK.LZH                  File Size:   64128
   The Beast pounces from the cliffs, and you'd better be glad he is not
   pouncing at you!  This is another excellent piece of Amiga artwork from
   the huge GATHERING93.LHA file, separated for easier downloading.

Number: 20079  Name: EDDIE_SILVER.LZH           File Size:  101120
   This is a surreal piece of fine Amiga art, Eddie Silver is obviously
   trying to put the pieces together.  It's an excellent picture, and
   an interesting surreal/modern composition.  I think I can almost hear
   some really good MOD playing behind it....

Number: 20078  Name: BATTLEMECH.LZH              File Size:  47744
   Yes, it is a Mech Warrior, aiming his three cannons down the side
   of some bluffs.  I'm glad I'm not looking UP at him!  The Mech itself
   is sleek and sexy looking, there isn't a sharp edge on it anywhere.

You can grab them all at once if you like, from the file:

# 19373 GATHER93.LHA             P.MORAWIEC      File Size: 404864
        Desc: Six great IFFs from Gathering'93


All I can say is ... more!  We want MORE Amiga pictures.  Share your best
with the entire Amiga Community, they just can't do this on a PeeCee. :)

                                by @{" Nick Cook " link Nick}

June may be busting out all over, but GEnie Amigans are still taking the
time to upload, upload, and upload! From the library this month...

*I CODE THE SONGS THAT MAKE MY AMIGA SING...*

19655 ASOLIDBREAKFAST.LHA 19654 DARKNESS&LIGHT.LHA 19653
MEDIEVALLIGHTS.LHA 19601 BLOODONTHER.LHA 19652 LUTHHYMNS.LHA 19600
BEAUTY.LHA 19911 URALVOLGA.LHA 19724 CALIBRA.LHA

While taste in music is personal, I enjoy mods that differ from the usual
pop hip hop techno rave rap retro 70s disco dance new age stuff. "A Solid
Breakfast" is listed in the Library as a "silly" mod. No false
advertising here; its a fun, up tempo work with a hint of the country
swing sound. Just the thing to play after reading about Commodore's
plunging stock prices. David Turner's "Darkness_&_Light" is a moody,
atmospheric 20 minute epic that swirls between ominous and affirmation.
Its like listening to a soundtrack from a sword and sorcery film. A
shorter Turner mod, "Medieval Lights", evokes images of a magical gnome's
apparatus-filled cave. Despite the title, Dr. Awesome's "Blood on the R"
(yep, that's the way it unarchives --I guess we'll never know what got
messy) is a charming chamber piece, perhaps something you'd hear on a
pre-guillotine visit to Marie Antoinette's court. "LuthHymms" is Dave
Reynolds' collection of four circa 1700s Lutheran hymns arranged for MED.
"Beauty" reminds one of Mandheim Steamroller: a Baroque-like theme played
on guitar and backed by a strong drum track. This mod is ideal for
multimedia production background music. "Ural Volga" sounds like a
Lawrence Welk polka on speed, and perhaps is one of the few mods which
make you laugh out loud. "Calibra" won first place at the Gathering. For
good reason. This jazz arrangement employs some of the best sampled
instruments I've ever heard on the Amiga. The resulting music sounds like
its coming straight off a CD. Great for music lovers, and a wonderful
addition to Amiga "brag" disks.

*LET THE GAMES BEGIN!*

19587 NETHACK31-1.LHA 19591 NETHACK31-2.LHA

After listening to all that medieval music, you may want to hobnob with
some wizards, elves, and, ah, kittens. NetHack is cross platform,
multi-level "Dungeons and Dragons" type game. Its a _huge_ two part
download. Workbench 1.2 + and at least 2 megs of RAM is required to play.
Over 3 megs of free hard drive space is recommended, or 4 floppies and
two drives can be used. Although the latter setup is acceptable, be
prepared for alotta disk swaps (BTW: one floppy should be labelled
"levels", not, as the ReadMe files states, "NHLevels"). Don't even think
about NetHack on a single floppy drive system; your patience will be
sorely tried, not to mention your wrist.  The interface is standard
Workbench with ascii graphics and text that reads a bit like the old
Adventure Construction Kit; e.g. "The bat bites you", "The rock hits you."

What the game lacks in bells and whistles, it makes up in depth. You can
chose to be one of several characters (I picked the anthropologist, and
my inventory included a bullwhip and brown fedora!), or let the computer
randomly select one for you. A complete guidebook explains the other
characters, traits, spells and locations. On line help is available and
welcome (a request for NetHack's programmers: how about an AmigaGuide
version of Help and the guidebook?).

19603 WIBBLEWORLDGIDDY.DMS Wibble World Giddy (say that five times fast)
is a cute British PD platform game, great for kids of all ages. You guide
Giddy, a rather peculiar, egg- shaped creature wearing a straw hat, on
his way home, gathering spinning coins and solving puzzles en route.
There's lots of smart aleck humor in this game: Giddy can pick up an
Atari ST (out of a trash can), graffiti spells out "boring, eh?", and a
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle tends shop. If Giddy encounters some dangers,
he doesn't "die", but rather goes "splat". The game world brims with
bright, animated graphics, the requisite rainbow sky background and
determinedly punchy music. Joystick control is good. The sometimes
controversial ".DMS" file compression is used on this file, so be
prepared to abandon all logic. When .DMS starts unpacking Wibble World
Giddy, it notes a non-standard boot block. Ignore it. After unpacking the
disk, .DMS discovers another error (apparently due to modem padding),
declares it fatal, then exits. Ignore it. If you double click the new
disk's icon, it will show 0% full. Ignore it. A "dir" command on the new
disk will reveal nothing. Ignore it. Boot off of the Wibble World Giddy,
and the game works. Since Giddy comes to us from overseas, its in PAL.
Giddy therefore disappears suddenly into some pits that are off the
bottom of the screen.

19762 STARSHIP20.LHA Don't think much of Captains Kirk and Picard? Think
that you can handle a starship better than those bus drivers? Here's your
chance. Starship 2.0 is an nearly commercial level simulator (And the
author, Russ Grasso, only wants $5! What a deal!). This is a *huge*
download! After unpacking, Starship 2.0 takes up more than 880K. Alas,
the NoteBook format manual and/or viewer refused to work for me, so I was
flying blind. The program features background sound effects (you can
choose music instead, but stick with the sound effects), multiple
windows, data readouts, etc. I'm not technically oriented, so I have no
idea whether the physics and concepts behind Starship are accurate or not
(admittedly a big part of simulations), but they certainly sound
impressive! This thing is slick, slick, slick!

19844 POPWORLDS2.LHA Dig out that old Populous game! The creative
Jennifer Reitz (of Accursed Toys) has designed some custom worlds, many
from cult sci-fi. How about a battle between ants and people, a la THEM!
Or aliens and arctic scientists from THE THING? Pretend you're a young
Steve McQueen fighting THE BLOB! There's even a SPACE:1999 set!
Instructions are included for integrating these custom worlds into the
Populous game.

*I'LL TAKE AMIGA UTILITIES FOR $20 PLEASE, ALEX.*

19599 TEXTRA14.LHA The much reviled "Ed" and "Edit" Workbench programs
touched off a cottage industry in text editors. David Hass' contribution
is Textra 1.4. This easy-to-use program is packed with features such as
background printing, ARexx, Undo, multiple windows in different fonts,
cut and paste between windows, a 'mouse-drag-select' function, as well as
on line help. Special programmers functions include angle and bracket
matching. As I merrily typed into column 84, I discovered with some
dismay that Textra lacks word wrap. While the demo version is completely
functional, $25 gets you a registered version which allows you to be free
from the minute's worth of nag screens.

19732 NOTEIT!.LHA 19752 TRASHCANICON.LHA 19900 CLICKDEPTH10.LHA Here's a
few nifty, small 2.0 + utilities to stuff in your overloaded WBStartup
drawer. NoteIt!, by Ryan J. Bruner, is an electronic version of those
yellow sticky notes. It opens a small window on the Workbench screen,
allowing you to type in your flashes of inspiration or shopping list. The
program saves your notes between power cycles or after approximately 10
seconds of inactivity. An iconify feature or Hot Keys would be a nice
addition to the next version. You don't have to empty the trash anymore
with TrashIcon. Mark McPherson's handy program places an icon at a
user-defined Workbench position, and deletes all files that are dragged
onto it. But wait, there's more! By setting tooltypes, TrashIcon will (or
won't) request confirmation before deleting a file, and can even perform
disk formats. ClickDepth V1.0, by Anders Hammarquist, a small, 2K
commodity that allows you to depth-arrange windows using the mouse and
(opional) qualifiers. For some reason, when I set up ClickDepth, it
operated opposite of what the docs said, but it worked nonetheless. Drop
this in WPStartup drawer if you usually leave a lot of windows open on
your Workbench.

19737 MULTIAPP.LHA MultiApp, by Claude Müller, places an AppIcon on your
Workbench. Drag a file icon onto the AppIcon, and MultiApp recognizes the
file as one of the user-defined types and executes a command.  For
example, drag the icon of an IFF-picture onto MultiApp's AppIcon.
MultiApp detects the IFF-ILBM format and shows the picture with a
user-defined viewer. GEnie member Malcom Allen helpfully includes a small
readme file on MultiApp's known bugs: it doesn't like file names with
spaces in them, and it ocassionally trashes its own config file. Setting
up MultiApp reminded me of setting up Tool Manager: despite printing out
the concise docs, the program still requires some intuitive "fiddling",
primarily as regards to paths, to get it up and running.

19831 DISKSALV2.LHA DiskSalv, Dave Haynie's long running disk salvage
program, is now out in a new version. It recovers data from a disk in
"severe trouble" (the ones that I let become cat toys), fixes many of the
problems directly on the problem disk, and locates valid partitions on a
disk with an unknown layout or damaged rigid disk block.  Version 2
supports all AmigaDOS file systems through 3.0. An appreciated
improvement is the point and click interface. For $40, a user receives an
approximately 100 page professional quality printed manual, AmigaGuide
on-line manual, the latest version and a free upgrade. Although at
present the shareware and registered version of DiskSalv are the same,
Haynie writes, they may not always be. DiskSalv is one of those "must
haves".

19564 AII_V135.LHA From the Land Down Under comes Archiving Intuition
Interface (AII), a workbench program that enables users to archive and
de-archive files using most of the various archivers around, without
needing to learn (or look up) multitudes of commands, what they stand
for, and type in CLI arguments. In other words, its mouse time. AII works
with Workbench 1.3 +, but requires ReqTools library (and according to the
docs, GadTools, but I don't have them and AII is working just fine). The
various archivers must be rounded up as well. Installation is a breeze
(drag the icon to the desired resting place), and creating the config.
file simply requires clicking on the archivers' names from their
directory. A minor annoyance is in the interface design: clickable
buttons are drawn the same as read-only boxes. AII is a utility that
makes life in the GEnie library easier!

* By the way - Here's a few tips on a some downloads:

19780 VIDEOTRACKER.LHA VideoTracker is a poor man's Deluxe Video: a way
to combine music and graphics. Apparently it doesn't like the '030: it
crashed on my 3000, but it ran on a 500. However, it gurued when I
attempted to load an example. Ah, well. Be prepared to spend some time
with this program.

19779 THEME_DREAM.MOD.LHA The mod Theme-Dream  requires a music player
that can handle PAL. In NTSC, the drum beat is "off".

*And you may need these files:

15924 DMS111.EXE (for Wibble World Giddy) 18984 REQTOOLSV21A.LHA (for
AII) 16895 LHA_138.RUN (for AII; perhaps the most common Amiga archiver)
18580 INFOZIP.LHA (for AII, but you may not need it) 19166 LX100.LHA (for
AII, but again, you may not need it)

We started with a song, so let's leave with a song: Summertime, and the
livin' is easy...

Enjoy!

                        B-17 FLYING FORTRESS
                           by @{" David Moore " link David}

In the spring of 1942, the US 8th Air Force joined the RAF in the bombing
of Germany. While the RAF bombed under the protection of darkness, the
Americans decided that daylight bombing would produce more accurate
results. Because of the increased vulnerability of daylight bombing, the
aircraft the Americans chose to undertake this task would need to be very
heavily armed. Thus it was that the mainstay of the US 8th Air Force, the
B-17, was known to all as the Flying Fortress.

B-17 Flying Fortress from Microprose has finally touched down on the
Amiga and seems to have been worth the wait. The usual large Microprose
box contains the, again, usual large game manual, foldout B-17 poster,
three disks, and an Amiga specific technical supplement.

The manual I know has received criticism from some quarters for
containing too much information which is irrelevant to the game. The
chapters which I think they are referring to deal with the historical
background to the bombing campaign and the development of the B-17
itself. I felt that these chapters added great authenticity and
atmosphere and really put the game in context. One thing I was
disappointed with given the multitude of keyboard commands was the
absence of a keyboard overlay as provided with F-19, for example.
Although a keyboard reference chart is provided in the technical
supplement, it is a poor substitute.

On to the game itself. As the B17 carried a crew of ten, you are
encouraged to move from position to position, it is much closer to games
like Megafortress from 360 than a "normal" single seat flight sim. In
fact the flying only takes up a small amount of your time. As such games
like this deserve a new classification. Air battle simulator perhaps?

When the game loads up, there are some nice loading screens and music to
enjoy. Once past the obligatory copy protection, you are asked to select
your bomber from a choice of six on the roster screen. You can select any
of the six and reset it, which will enable you to select your own nose
art from a choice of cartoon characters [or scantily clad young ladies,
whichever you prefer!] You can also name your bomber as well.

Once this has been done, you can go onto the Ops room, where you can
assigned missions (the ultimate goal of the game is to complete a tour of
25 missions) or undergo some training - which would be advisable. You can
also view a photograph of your crew from which you can select a file on
each man giving you his skills ratings: Gunnery, Bombing, Technical,
Medical and Piloting. Obviously crew members will be better at his
speciality than any other, but should say the Navigator be injured, you
could check the stats to see who could his job at a lower level (when the
crew successfully complete a mission, their stats improve accordingly).
Should you be unfortunate to have a crew member killed, his replacement
will invariably be a rookie and you will have to nuture his skills in
exactly the same way, so obviously it is in your interest to look after
your crew. It is this aspect of the game which makes it stand out of
other games. You feel a sense of involvement with your crew.

When you are assigned a mission you can view reconnaissance film of the
targets which is very useful, as the target will look quite different
from 10,000 ft. Before you actually start the game proper, you can tailor
the difficulty, by setting up the quality of the enemy opposition and the
reliability of the bombs you will be dropping.

Once done, you begin the game in the Pilot's seat at your dispersal point
on the airfield. At each crew position, you can toggle between manual and
computer control (effectively, your crew member in that position). You
can involve yourself as much as you like. For the first training mission
you would probably be well advised watching what goes on during the
course of the mission. On takeoff and landing you will be occupied in the
pilots stations, the Navigator will be used throughout the mission, while
the gunners will come into their own repelling fighters over enemy
territory. All this is to allow the Bombardier to drop his bombs on the
right target. The graphics are well detailed, the rendition of the pilots
panels are particulary noteworthy. When the aircraft is viewed
externally, the gun turrets can be seen traversing, the gunners scanning
the skies for enemy aircraft. Indeed, there are a whole range of views to
experiment with. A particularly good view is a close up view of your
target, so you can see exactly where your bombs impact.

If you make the journey home and land successfully your crew improve,
promotions and decorations are on offer as well as coming on step closer
to the goal of 25 missions. I have only scratched the surface of the game
in this review. There is a rich depth of detail which will become
apparent to the player after extended use. B-17 can wholeheartedly be
recommended to the flight sim enthusiast.

                  DUNE II - THE BATTLE FOR ARRAKIS - VIRGIN
                             by @{" Derek Dela Fuente " link Derek}

Dune was visually one of the nicest looking games of the year with some
state of the art graphics and animation but to some critics the actual
game did not have enough depth or longevity. Dune II is written by
Westwood Studios, the team behind Eye of the Beholder 1 & 2 and Kyrandia.
The first Dune game was written by Kryo in France but the American
presentation is far removed from the first. It can be likened to Sim
City...in fact, Sim Sand could be a good title. The onus of the game is
very much on strategy and management with a heavy real-time combat
element. The view within the game is top down.

The introduction to Dune II is meant to give the player a brief bit of
background. Various animated sequences and synchronized music will build
the setting for the game. The player is then given three totally
different families or `Houses' to choose from and play. Each house has it
own personalities - Atreides, Ordod or Harkonnens. The intention, when
you are allied to one house, is gaining control of the planets most
valuable commodity - the drug, spice.

The core of Dune II's strategy element concerns the manufacture and
management of functional buildings such as spice refinement plants and
military and civilian units. In combat, players can set their forces in
motion and concentrate on the other aspects of play or closely control
individual units to utilise them to their best capability.

When the player chooses his House the other two will be generated by the
computer. These computer controlled houses display different
personalities and strategies. The variety of Houses and the ways to play
each will greatly enhance the game ensuring that the it is never the same.

If, for instance, you choose the house Atreides, you will play the good
guys in the game. This is a very idealistic house, run by honour codes
and utopian ideals. Due to these attributes, the Attreides will often
speak of their strengths and rarely of any weaknesses. The benefit of
this type of personality is that the honour and moral of their men is
unparalleled. Yet this also causes them to underestimate a situation or
enemy, believing that their superiority will prevail in any situation.

Throughout the game you will build, buy better equipment and generally
acquire more land. You may have just a small yard to start with. This
will require windtraps to be placed before you can start on the refinery.
Construction is a very important aspect of the game.

The player will have to create and maintain vast bases in each scenario.
To succeed at this task, the player will need to manage his resources
very wisely. Each building that is created is functional and each
performs a specific task: refine spice, produce military and civilian
units, construct other buildings, provide power, provide trade, etc.

The combat side to the game is in real-time, easily and quickly
manipulated via the mouse and is not turn-based. This real- time combat
adds intensity to the game and will keep the player's concentration high
throughout each scenario. The player can set his units in motion and
concentrate on the other features of the game. A menu will appear to help
the combat procedure: attack, defend or retreat can easily be executed.

The presentation to the game, especially the digitised voices and speech,
makes it very appealing. The digitised sound will bring battles to life
with the sound of guns booming and soldiers screaming. Each house has a
different digitised voice. One could have a woman's voice whilst the
other has a powerful man's voice giving the player a better understanding
and feel of what is happening.

The game has a very structured format. The process from starting to build
with concrete slabs to light factories with walls will become apparent
but much skill will be required to achieve your goals.

`Dune II' is a wholly more intriguing game than the original, requiring
tactical know-how as opposed to the puzzle- based, structured approach
required of `Dune I'. Highly recommended.

                               About This Issue

As we promised, this issue contains one more "goodie" than the previous
issue.  If you've downloaded the VPXTRA_JUL93 file for this issue, and if
everything is in the proper place, some of the articles were accompanied
by graphics.  If you didn't read the ReadMe that accompanied the VPXTRA
file, then you missed this tidbit:

You need to assign VPort: to the place of residence for the VPXTRA files.
If, for example, those graphics are in a drawer named VPort on the volume
named HD1: then you'd need to type the following in a CLI:

assign VPort: HD1:VPort

You'll also need the program WDisplay, available in the AmigaGuide archive.

You may also have noticed our thanks to Paul Rigby, of
Amiga Mart.  Two reviews in this issue - B-17 Flying Fortress and Dune II
- come to us courtesy of Amiga Mart, a British magazine with which we
have a reciprocal agreement.  Thanks to Paul, we'll be carrying articles
from Amiga Mart on a regular basis.

And now, back to the task at hand:  ViewPort.guide for August, with text,
