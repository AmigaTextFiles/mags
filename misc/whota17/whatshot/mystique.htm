Amiga International</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Hello everyone,

<P>Amiga International has shown their support for the Amiga's Premier 
Children's
Site by sponsoring the site's creators, <A HREF="http://www.mystcorp.u-
net.com/">Mystique Corporation</a>!!


<P>Now it is <B>your</b> turn to show your support for children's software
on the Amiga.

<P>The latest update of the site includes a new FORUM, a means by which
you can put forward your ideas and comments on children's software on the 
Amiga.

<P>It is our intention to have these ideas acted upon so that when the new
Amigas are released (whatever form they may take), they are able to compete
with PCs as a great computer for <b>all</b> the family!!

<P>I am sure that you are aware that current software for children is extremely
limited, so help us change that by offering your thoughts to the entire Amiga 
community!!

<P>All comments from developers, parents and children are very welcome :-)

<P><BR>Also...We are looking for people to help us with expanding the site.

<P>Surf on over NOW to see how you can help us with reviews, stories or artwork
and to add your ideas to the forum...

<P>Thanks everyone.  Merry Christmas!!
