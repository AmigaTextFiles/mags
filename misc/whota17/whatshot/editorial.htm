Hi,
<p>
This issue's editorial and this issue of What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine, 
concentrates on Quake, with numerous articles appearing in this issue's <A 
HREF="nib.htm">News In Brief</A> with some images thrown in, but there is 
still no word offically on it.  Also <A HREF="doom.htm">Doom</A> gets a 
mention in an article with a Amiga port of Doom now available as a beta version.
<p>
This issue exclusive articles are on <A HREF="stratego.htm">Stratego</A> and 
<A HREF="jms.htm">the Jay Miner Society</A>.
<p>
Other than a couple of other articles, there isn't that much else in this issue, but I'd 
like to thank Alan Crandall for his pointing me in the direction of the JMS, which 
allowed me to put the article together and also a few new imagelinks have been 
added to the News Section.  The promised article on PCI slots for the Amiga which 
was supposed to be in this issue will hopefully turn up in the next issue.
<p>
On the subject of the next issue, it is possible to maybe out a little later than usual, 
due to other commitments that I've got on in the 2nd and 3rd weeks of January, 
but there will be at least one issue out in January and that is for sure. 
<p>
What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine can still be found on the web, at: <p> <A 
HREF="http://www.sonic.net/~alanwall/whota/index.html">http://www.sonic.net/~al
anwall/whota/index.html</A>.  
<p>
This issue contains a <A HREF="survey.htm">survey</A>, which I hope you'll 
fill in and send back to me as I was asked by Geosync Media before whota15, to 
provide information of the specifications of the Amigas that you're using currently.  
So far there have been some responses, but I'm including the survey in this issue in 
the hope that more people will respond to it, and as always, the survey is also 
available at the web site.  This will be the last issue in which the survey will be in, 
but will be on the web site, for a little while longer. 
<p>
Now this month's, Site Of The Month is <A HREF="http://www.cu-
amiga.co.uk">CU-Amiga</A>, which at the moment has got a couple of surveys 
on it, for you to fill in, amongst other things and is always worth a visit. 
<P>
Check out <A HREF="links.htm">Links</A> for the latest additions to my Links 
Section.
<p>
Before, I end this issue's editorial, I'm still accepting anymore offers of free web 
space as I'd like to have a mirror site as well, if you have any, then e-mail me at:
<p>
<A 
HREF="mailto:imortimer@jupmqljb.demon.co.uk">imortimer@jupmqljb.demon.co.
uk</A>
<P>
And also I'm looking contributions of news articles or links, they will be greatly 
appreciated along with images for image links as I'd like to fill in some of the 
spaces on some of the pages, so just e-mail them to me at:
<p>
