<B><FONT SIZE="6">A</FONT>fter a long wait ID have released the source 
code for
Doom into the Public Domain. Ports of the game are now possible without any any
legal problems getting in the way.</B><P>

Doom was probably one of the most important releases ever on the PC, it has sold
thousands of copies and has spawned many clones.  However, it never appeared on
the Amiga, something that can be addressed now.<P>

As for when we we see any ports, well, I have heard that there are some already
in developmemt.  Also, there have been rumours that a couple of ports have
already been done, these were not released due to legal problems.  Maybe we will
see thiese ports surface now too.<P>

Anyone wishing to get hold of the source can do so by clicking on this link

VSPACE="5"> The first Amiga Doom port has already been released. Only 3 days
after the source code was released we already have the chance to play Doom on
our Amigas.<P>

The game is still in beta stage but from reports that I have had from several
people it is already playable even on a basic 030/50Mhz.  This is the minimun
spec I have heard about it being tested on so I'm not sure if it runs on
anything less.<P>
To play the game you will require an original Doom .wad file as well as
RTGMaster-27.0 & ixemul-47.2.  All of these are available from Aminet/ID
Software homepage and the Amiga Doom port homepage.

The current homepage for AmigaDoom is:-<P>
