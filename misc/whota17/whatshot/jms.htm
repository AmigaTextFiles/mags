<center><font size=4>Call for Nominations for Trustees of The Jay Miner 
Society for the Advancement of Personal Computing</font></center>
<p>
<PRE>
Date: Mon, 15 Dec 1997 19:52:40 -0500
From: Giorgio Gomelsky <gio1@INTERPORT.NET>
To: ARISE@LISTSERV.ARIZONA.EDU
Subject: [ARISE] Call For Nominations
</PRE>
<p>
I, Giorgio Gomelsky, am currently the sole Trustee of the Jay Miner Society,
and therefore in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Society
I will be appointing new Trustees to form a governing Board or Steering
Committee for the Society, consisting of seven members. I am now calling
for nominations of Trustees from among the membership of the Society. Assuming
that there are more nominations than places on the Board, there will be
an election among those nominated.

<P>The position of Treasurer is special in that New York state law requires
him/her to be a resident of the state of NY and to have physical access
to the society's bank for the purposes of making deposits and withdrawals.
Assignment of the positions of President and Secretary will be decided
by the new Trustees after their appointment.

<P>Candidates must be current members of the Society and must be nominated
by another member. No member may nominate more than one candidate, and
I will ask all nominees to confirm their nomination. Any member fulfilling
the legal criteria for the position of Treasurer may be specifically nominated
for this position; this will not preclude his/her being appointed to another
position. Nominations must be sent to me by electronic mail or the US postal
service by midnight after 21st December 1997.

<P>I reserve the right to reject any nominations which do not meet the
above conditions or whose authorship appears to have been forged.

<P>If there are fewer than five nominations, or if there are no nominations
for the position of Treasurer, I will re-open nominations for a further
period. If there are exactly seven then they will become the new
trustees. If there are more than seven nominations, voting will begin
at midnight before 22nd December 1997, and before this time and after 
nominations
are complete I will issue a voting form by electronic mail
to all members. This form will carry full instructions on how to vote.

<P>The vote-takers will count and compare the valid votes they receive
and will send a summary of votes and the results to all members by electronic
mail by midnight before 31st December 1997. Any objections to the result
must be sent to me by electronic mail by midnight before 3rd January 1998.
In the absence of any valid objections, the elected candidates will be
appointed Trustees on 3rd January 1998 and if I am not among them I will
resign as Trustee at that time.

The Jay Miner Society is an organisation dedicated to the fostering of the
spirit of the the Amiga. Working to the philosophy of <EM>Excellence through
Simplicity</EM>, we are a user orgranisation that has decided to finally take
control of its own platform in order to guarantee its future. Our motto:
<STRONG>we are the Amiga!</STRONG></P>

<P>The Amiga has had a strange history. Years ahead of its time in both
the hardware and software spheres, it enjoyed a wonderful period during the
late 1980s and early 1990's when it was the pre-eminent choice for the
discerning computer user. And then disaster, Commodore going under, Escom
going under and the Amiga foundering, despite the valiant efforts of the
community itself.</P>

<P>There lies our inspiration. Despite no official development, no marketing,
the Amiga continued to survive, continued to expand, continued to develop.
Over the past twelve months it has become apparent that the Amiga is no longer
something to be owned by any one company, it is owned by the users and the
developers - <STRONG>we are the Amiga</STRONG>, and whether Amiga is 
owned by
a supportive parent company or not, we intend to push our platform
forward.</P>

<P>JMS is a primarily user-driven initiative that has been coalescing for
nearly a year.	Its birth was an amazing process, probably impossible before
the age of the Internet. A broad cross-section of Amigans - some well known,
including Carl Sassenrath, Dale Luck, Dave Haynie, R J Mical and other 'Amiga
legends' - and others less so - users, writers, developers and dealers in the
US, Canada, Europe, Africa and Japan - batted various ideas and aspirations
back and forth on a closed mailing list (ARise) for some months.</P>

<P>At the heart of the discussion was the issue of computing in the Amiga
spirit. Remember that at that time Gateway wasn't even a gleam in anyone's eye
as respects the Amiga's future! Like all Amigans (and not a few users of other
platforms too) we had real concerns about the direction personal computing was
moving - more complexity, extravagant waste of resources (with consequently
less stability and functionality), fewer alternatives, 'dumbed-down' software
with little flexibility.  This is the exact opposite of the elegant promise of
the Amiga envisioned by Jay Miner.</P>

<P>We all understand that the Amiga has been badly neglected and has fallen
behind in many ways. Still we would like to see improved support of existing
machines <EM>and</EM>, what is more important, accelerated work toward 
next
generation Amigas (and/or their descendants and siblings) and a common 'Next
Generation' OS for them.</P>

<P>Since the long anticipated purchase of the Amiga's assets by Gateway
2000, we have seen a renewed interest by the industry, and along with that we
intend to help GW2K to recognise the Amiga and the community for what they
are, a unique resource, a unique customer base. We would like them to work
with us to move the platform forwards into the new millenium, and they have
stated an interest in doing exactly that. All we know is that <STRONG>we are
the Amiga</STRONG> and after a few years of having our platform torn apart 
and
left to die, we just aren't going to stand by and watch anymore.</P>

<P>What we are is an attempt to bring the Amiga community together, to 
provide
some focus, and a possible path into the future. We want to expand the
platform, move it towards an open platform concept in both the hardware and
the software arena, to see it push hard into those areas which are crying out
for a simple, powerful, elegant solution. That is our agenda and we hope that
the community will rally round and join us. We are no longer just consumers,
we are adventurers and we want to ensure that the adventure continues.</P>

<P>To summarise, our goals have been:</P>

<OL>

<LI>To form a non-profit association of Amigans, organized to protect and
advance the Amiga and its software, open to representation/contacts with the
other major user/interest groups. This would be a place to organize the voices
of like-minded Amigans and to get them heard. <STRONG>R J Mical, Dale Luck 
and
Carl Sassenrath visited Mrs Carol Miner on 1 May 1997, and obtained her
permission and blessing to use the name "Jay Miner Society for the Advancement
of Personal Computing". The Society <A
HREF="http://www.jms.org/forum/news-19970814-jmslegal.html">was legally 
incoporated</A> on 14
August.</STRONG>

<LI>To launch and support an Industrial Council of engineers and developers to
discuss and possibly organise appropriate development projects. <STRONG>
The <A HREF="http://www.jms.org/forum/news-19970517-icoa.html">IC was 
officially launched</A> as the
'Industry Council for the Open Amiga' at the 1997 World of Amiga, in London,
UK. Gateway 2000 directly contacted us, and has twice expressed interest
publicly our ICOA initiative. Recently, ICOA and JMS representatives were
invited, along with several other representatives of the Amiga community, to
an initial meeting at their South Dakota, USA Head Office.</STRONG>

<LI>To bring together a 'council of elders' consisting of some of the high
profile 'creators' of the Amiga who've been involved in discussion on the
ARise list. We hope that they will be able to provide some authority as people
who 'have a clue', as opposed to bankers, lawyers, corporate bean-counters
etc. We would hope they would help be a unifying force in the fragmented
community.

</OL>

<P><A HREF="http://www.jms.org/forum/discussion.html">Current 
discussions</A> involve the
enhancement of this website, formation of a joint user/owner PR scheme,
establishment of JMS by-laws, an official newsletter, user group outreach and
membership drive, and setting of guidelines for working groups (teams
attacking special projects).</P>

If you've found this website, it seems likely you may have already
heard something about the Jay Miner Society. The JMS has been discussed on the
Internet, at Amiga exhibitions, and elsewhere. It is still 'early days' for
JMS, and many new initiatives are shaping up! We think you'll want to find out
a bit about it so you can decide whether it's of interest to you. This web
site will show you something of what the Society is doing. But to get a more
dynamic and interactive taste, you can subscribe to the <A
HREF="http://www.jms.org/library/2ndwind.html">Second Wind Mailing 
List</A>.</P>

<P>If you find that you support our goals, you are currently invited to
contribute $50 US for a Founding Membership, which involves annual voting
rights and other membership privileges. Yes, this is a lot - most of us viewed
our contributions as a 'donation to a worthy cause', an investment in the
future, rather than a 'purchase of services'. Other types of (more affordable)
membership may become available later. Special options for User Group
affiliation options are likely to be arranged too.</P>

<P>This might be a good point to mention that we do not intend JMS to usurp
in any way the role of the local user groups - not that it could. We believe
that the user groups around the world are one of the greatest assets the Amiga
has - without them, it would almost certainly be defunct! We want to tailor
JMS to supply connectivity and functionality to worldwide User Groups, and to
let them have a joint voice with which to address the Amiga's new owners. To
date, the idea of an independent Industrial Council that would include user
representation in the person of a JMS representative has been well received by
Gateway/AI. We feel certain the international Amiga user community will
benefit if we can solidify this high level of respect for their input by the
new owners. This would certainly be an improvement over previous regimes!</P>

<P>The JMS web pages - specifically, the <A 
HREF="http://www.jms.org/gold/index.html">Hall of
Gold</A> - will show you exactly how any money is spent as a matter of policy.
In any case the JMS is registered as a not-for-profit society, so its
financial dealings are open to public scrutiny.</P>

<P>The actual mechanisms of sending money to the JMS are not quite as
straightforward as we would like at the moment. If you live in the US you can
send a check or cash to <A HREF="mailto:gio1@interport.net">Giorgio
Gomelsky</A>, who will pay it directly into the JMS central bank account:

<ADDRESS>The Jay Miner Society for the Advancement of Personal 
Computing<BR>
c/o Giorgio Gomelsky<BR>140 West 24th Street<BR>New York<BR> NY
10011-1902</ADDRESS></P>

<P>If you live outside the US, you can send a cheque for $50 or CDN$70 to
<A HREF="mailto:accolon@ionline.net">Andrew Bienhaus</A>. He has set up
an account with a Canadian bank that does not charge for handling foreign
cheques. There are no charges for transferring funds on from that account into
the central account in New York. The details are:

<ADDRESS>The Jay Miner Society<BR>c/o Andrew Bienhaus<BR>
90 Farr Crescent<BR>Cambridge<BR>Ontario N3C 
1R6<BR>Canada</ADDRESS></P>

<P>You can also wire money directly into the account:

<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR><TH ALIGN=RIGHT>Bank name:<TD>Toronto Dominion Bank
<TR><TH ALIGN=RIGHT>Bank:<TD>004
<TR><TH ALIGN=RIGHT>Transit:<TD>26562
<TR><TH ALIGN=RIGHT>Designator:<TD>0351
<TR><TH ALIGN=RIGHT>Account name:<TD>Jay Miner Society
<TR><TH ALIGN=RIGHT>Account:<TD>0000364
</TABLE></P>

<P>But before you send anything, please check the current details with whoever
you are going to send the money to! Bank charges can wipe out a large part of
your contribution if it is in the wrong form. Once your contribution has
been received, you should receive notification by email and your name should
be added to the <A HREF="http://www.jms.org/library/members.html">list of 
members</A> here.</P>
