been confirmed that a deal between ClickBOOM and ID Software has been 
completed for Quake, Amiga owners will now finally get a chance to try out this 
excellent title.
<br>
<br>
<img src=images/quake00.gif alt=Shamber align=left>It will of course be CD-
Rom only 
and will be of a high spec to be able to play Quake at it's best.  The release date 
of Quake for the Amiga is said to be soon.

<CENTER><H2>More Amiga RC5 Team Effort News</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs">RSA Laboratories</A> has announced 
an interim challenge, <A HREF="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/des2/">DES II</A>, 
which Bovine is likely to participate in, as are we. The challenge starts January 
13<SUP>th</SUP> 1998, there will most likely be a hybrid client that will allow 
you to take part in DES II as well as the current RC5-64. Info on this is somewhat 
sparse at the moment, check out the <A 
HREF="http://www.distributed.net/des">Bovine DES II page</A> for now. The 
DES Challenge II is likely to take a couple of months at most (with prize money up 
to $10,000 tied to it), so the intermission will probably not detract too much from 
the current RC5-64 effort.

<CENTER><H2>Latest News On Quake</H2></CENTER>
<P>
It has been assumed from the presence of Quake in the Products section of 
ClickBOOM/PXL's web site that a deal with ID Software had been reached allowing 
ClickBOOM to bring Quake to the Amiga.  Well, this has now been removed from 
their site, but it has been revealed through people on the Newsgroups, who have 
bought Myst that there is a card inside the box mentioning that Quake is coming 
soon.  So according to this, it seems that ClickBOOM haven't got the deal sorted 
yet, but below is some more information on Quake for the Amiga.
<p>
<img align=left hspace=3 vspace=3 src="images/quake1_s.gif" alt="Quake" 
WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="119"> The Amiga
version of Quake has all the features of the PC version. It should be possible to use
a wide range of Quake add-ons, and network access has also been promised. 
Indeed we
can expect to see Quake &quot;clans&quot; of Amiga users turning up on the 
internet
based multi user Quakeworlds.
<p>

<img align=right hspace=3 vspace=3 src="images/quake2_s.gif" alt="Quake" 
WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120"></a>
We'll have to wait and see how well the final version of Quake runs on the Amiga
before we can tell you exactly how fast it will run on your system, but from what 
we
have seen, it's going to be pretty good. Keeping in low resolution, it should be
playable on an AGA machine with a 68040 or better accelerator, although clearly 
the
better the processor the better it will run. We'll have to wait for the PowerPC
version to see Quake running at its best, however. A Quake demo was shown 
running on
a PowerPC by Haage and Partner in Cologne, and it run at an impressive speed 
indeed.
It is yet to be confirmed, but it seems likely that Clickboom will
also be supporting the Permedia 2 based Cybervision and BlizzardvisionPPC graphics
add-on cards. Quake is noted for using the OpenGL 3D graphics API, which is 
directly
supported on the phase5 cards by the CyberGL implementation of the OpenGL 
standard. A
68060 Amiga with a graphics card will run Quake rather nicely, a PPC Amiga with
the 3D card will be something to behold.  I've heard that in the March issue of Cu 
Amiga Magazine there will be exclusive details, but stay here to find out the latest.

<CENTER><H2>Myst CyberGFX Add-on available</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/myst.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">
<B><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he CyberGFX add-on for Myst to allow GFX 
card owners
to play the game has been released.</B><P>

Myst, which was released a couple of weeks ago didn't have full GFX card support
at release.  This was due the fact that ClickBOOM wanted to get it out before
christmas and the CyberGFX part was not completly tested.  However, it has now
been completed and is available from the ClickBOOM website ONLY (It will be 
made
freely available on Aminet in the future).<P>

Myst got quite a good response when it was released and it one of the first
Amiga games to provide decent support for Graphic Card users.<P>

I suggest that all you Graphic Card users out there buy this game, of not only
to show your suuport forClickBOOM, you moan about games not supporting
graphic card, well heres one that does!  They are giving the Amiga some
excellent games and will continue to do this in 1998, with our support anyway.

To get hold on the CyberGFX archive, you have to email ClickBOOM from there
webpage (In the Myst, downloads section) and they will then send you an email
with the archive attached.<P>

The ClickBOOM webpage can be found at:-<P>
