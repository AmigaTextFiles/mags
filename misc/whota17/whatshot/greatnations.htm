Nations is a new
Civilization style with far superior network play and customisability.</B><P>

The actual workings of the game itself are very much based on the Microprose
classic Civilization, it builds onto this game engine the very exciting prospect
of internet play.  This isn't something that hasn't been done before though, as
I'm sure those of you who have heard of or even played FreeCiv know.  However,
this goes a step further then FreeCiv by adding better graphics and more complex
gameplay.<P>

The game virtually features everything that was in the original Civilization. 
New features that the game has include unlimited map size (Well, that is until
you run out of memory, needs about 8 bytes per map square), realistic line of
sight, flying and submarine units that have variable height & depth, an option
to create custom maps and much more.<P>

The game supports virtually all native Hi-Res 128 colour+ graphics modes.  You
can even run it in ridiculous resolutions like 1024x1024 if you wanted,
obviously a graphics card would be required for this which the game also
supports.  To make things easier to view in the different resolutions the game
has a number of tilesets, it has both a 16x16 and a 32x32 tileset.  There are
also scaled down versions of these so you can view large areas of the map.<P>

Probably the best thing about this game is the multiplayer support that is has. 
Up to 7 people can play at once either via the internet or via serial port play.
For the player who doesn't like playing against other people there will
hopefully be an AI for computer players implemented too, this would allow just
two people to play and the numbers can be made up with computer players.<P>

As you can see from the screenshots, the game looks very good (Or maybe not as
it may be, as they had to be scaled down, so they may look a little dodgy.  Expect 
to see the full-screenshots in issue 7 of WHOTA).  The game will also feature a 
background module to keep you awake on during them late night games. ;)<P>

Requirments for the game are any Amiga with the AGA chipset or a Graphics Card. 
Workbench 3.0, a 68020+, 6Mb Memory (More for the bigger tilesets) and 
AmiTCP or
compatiable TCP stack for network play.  It is recommended by the authors that
you pkay using a GFX card as native screenmodes can be quite slow.<P>

A demo is available now (If slightly restricted) from the homepage, so download it 
and give it a go.  It still has a fair number of bugs though
so don't hesitate to contact the author if you have any problems.<P>
