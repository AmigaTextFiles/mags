@NODE edit "Editorial Page"
Just like everyone else, I am sick of the rumors surrounding the Commodore
liquidation.  I wish some news would break NOW!  

It's become apparent that the management team of Commodore UK is trying 
to position itself as the front runner in the candidacy for the title of 
"New Owner."  By sending letters and faxes to what's left of the 
Commodore dealership in the U.S, David Pleasance and his team have made 
promises that the Amiga community at large had been wanting to hear from
the company BEFORE the liquidation.  Promises of continuing the current
product line; of keeping the US in supply of NTSC machines; of cooperating
with third party developers who wish to develop products for the Amiga; of
advertising their products to the right people and not trying to compete
with IBM or Apple in the business machine market; and, possibly the best 
news of all, not involving Mehdi Ali in anything ever again.

These are big promises.  They are also coming from someone who just could
be the one to deliver on them...FINALLY!  Although, there is a catch to
all of this.  The financing that Commodore UK has obtained to fund the
buyout of Commodore International and Commodore Electronics is dependent
on getting things up and running in time for the Christmas season. 
Pleasance has said that they have to be given the "go ahead" by August 
30th to do that.  

Although I doubt that a few days difference would hurt them either way,
Pleasance shows that he's being realistic right off the bat.  If no
machines are able to be produced for the Christmas season, we might as
well blow out that candle we've got burning in the window for the safe
return of the Amiga to retail outlets and store fronts.

I sincerely hope that the creditors realize that Commodore UK is THE way
to get the money they want back.  The other companies that are bidding 
for the Amiga technology seem akin to vultures looking for a safe time 
to land before picking the bones of the computer we love so much.  

Best of luck to Commodore UK.  Here's hoping that by the next issue of
AEM we know who we're dealing with.

On another topic, I'd like to point out a slight address change.  All
Internet mail for the magazine should be directed to the following
Internet address: sean.caszatt@f512.n2601.z1.fidonet.org 

I cannot call Delphi to get mail on a regular basis anymore, so addressing

(Plus, it will receive a faster reply.)

Until next month, have fun with your Amiga!

@NODE GAME1 "The Settlers Review by Tony Belding"
THE SETTLERS
SYSTEMS: All Amigas
HARD DRIVE INSTALLABLE: Yes
MEMORY REQUIRED: 1 MB or higher
CONTROLLER: Mouse
Workbench 1.3/2.x/3.x compatible

The Settlers only runs in PAL mode, and it won't open a DblPAL screen on
my Amiga 4000/040.  It does install on hard disk, starts from Workbench, 
doesn't multi-task but does return to the Workbench OK -- which would be 
a handy feature if I didn't have to reboot for PAL mode.  It also takes 
good advantage of any extra RAM you might have.

The game reminds me of an ant colony.  It's fascinating to watch the tiny
people going about their business: building houses, chopping down trees,
forging iron, farming, baking bread, etc.  The graphics are good, though I
wish there could have been an AGA version.

The game plays very slowly and provides lots of intricate detail, not much
excitement.  It's certainly not as exciting as Populous II where you would
have volcanoes erupting, mass warfare, guys walking around with their 
heads on fire, etc...

Despite the level of detail, The Settlers doesn't offer a whole lot of
control over the activity of the settlers.  For the most part, you tell 
them where to build houses, what kind of house to build, and you lay 
roads to connect them.  From there the little guys just do their thing.

You can also tell your knights where to attack.  Combat can be downright
boring as the knights take turns duelling in single combat in front of a
guard hut or tower.  Occaisionally fights break out in the open country 
when one group of knights intercepts another.  The victory is satisfying 
when enemy buildings burst into flames.  The vast part of the game is 
spent building up your society to prepare for battle.  The actual war, 
when it comes, is not such a big deal.

Really getting into this game will require MANY hours of play.  My overall
impression is of a pretty good game -- not necessarily perfect, but worth
buying for those who like "god sim" games and are looking for a new
challenge.

@NODE GAME2 "Chaos Engine AGA Review by Tony Belding"
CHAOS ENGINE AGA
SYSTEM: Amiga 1200 or Amiga 4000
HARD DRIVE INSTALLABLE: No
MEMORY REQUIRED: 1 MB or higher
CONTROLLER: Joystick
Only works on systems with the AGA chipset

The Chaos Engine AGA comes on two disks, plus a "Boot Disk" to put the
computer in PAL mode.  It's odd, because the game appears to run on a
320x200 display.  My guess is that the programmers chose this odd
arrangement to deal with speed problems...

I had heard good things about The Chaos Engine, and I got the demo which 
was really impressive.  I figured it would really blaze on my A4000.  Hah!

First problem was when I tried to boot up by the directions.  The game 
would not boot.  It accessed the boot drive for just a moment and then 
died.  I tried everything.  Frustated, I set it aside and spent the rest 
of the evening playing The Settlers.  Next day I tried again.  I learned 
that the game will boot, but I just hadn't been patient enough!  It sits 
and waits about half a minute (with a black screen and no disk activity) 
before proceeding to load the game.  I have no idea why.

BTW, the game disks are copy protected and it's not installable.  The 
manual says, "Do not attempt to `back up' this data as it may be destroyed 
in the process.  And it's also an infringement of copyright.  Renegade 
Software Ltd accepts no responsibility for disks damaged as a direct 
result of infringement of copyright."  Give me a break!

When I get into the game, I am sorely disappointed.  The AGA graphics 
hardly make the game look any better than the demo version (just a little 
less dithering), but the game action is HORRIBLY SLOW and JERKY!  This 
is a true crawling horror.  Compared to the fast, smooth action of the 
ECS demo, the difference is just unbelievable.

Avoid this game like the plague.  This game was the LAST STRAW for me.  
From now on I will not buy any more action games for the Amiga.  I can 
play on game consoles and skip all these hassles.

@NODE GAME3 "Apidya Review"
APIDYA
SYSTEM: Amiga 500 or higher
HARD DRIVE INSTALLABLE: No
MEMORY REQUIRED: 1 MB or higher
CONTROLLER: Joystick
Workbench 1.3/2.x/3.x compatible

A sorcerer named Hexaa has tortured your lover by unleashing an army of
mutant insects upon her while she slept.  Her life hangs in the balance,
requiring an antidote that must be retrieved from the depths of the evil 
Hexaa's kingdom.  

Using a talisman that possesses magical powers, you transform yourself
into a bee and fly off to face Hexaa's army of insects with a burning pain
in your soul.

I don't know about you, but that sounds like one heck of a way to start
off a game!  I liked the scenario and I love the game.  APIDYA is a
non-stop, side-scrolling shoot 'em up that has superior graphics and
gameplay compared to any shoot 'em up in recent memory.

I believe this game was originally released in 1992, but didn't make much
of a wave (at least not in the States).  Team 17 has re-released it as
a budget title and it's now available in a wider release.

There's not much to explain in terms of what you have to do.  Simply start
shooting and keep shooting.  A variety of critters usually more common in
the garden than on a computer screen will try to blast you from the sky. 
Beetles, snails, grasshoppers and flying ants are among the enemies you'll
face in your hunt for the antidote.  All of them are beautifully animated
and drawn.  The scrolling backgrounds are lush and atmospheric.  The game
is another of those ECS games that look AGA.  (What is it that makes these
ECS games seem to be more impressive than most AGA titles?)

The game isn't perfect though.  Some of the backgrounds are lush and
atmospheric, but they also can camouflage quite a few enemy insects.  
The game is unforgiving and merely touching these hard-to-see critters is
instant death.  Also, the game is not hard drive installable, which is 
getting to be quite a turn-off these days.  With CD-ROM gaming now a 
reality, can't hard drive installable games for the Amiga become the norm?
Why are Amiga owners constantly penalized by making the games available 
only on bootable floppies?  And, as was the case with last issue's
ELFMANIA review, this is a game that all Amiga owners deserve to see, but
won't because the game requires the use of PAL mode.  This means that 
unless your machine has a 1 MB Fatter Agnus chip or equivalent, you won't 
be able to play APIDYA.

Other than those complaints which, other than the hard drive problem,
aren't that severe, APIDYA comes highly recommended.

@NODE GAME4 "Total Carnage Review"
TOTAL CARNAGE
SYSTEM: CD남

I don't know what came over me as I opened the case of Total Carnage.  I
was actually looking forward to playing the game.  An arcade conversion
for the CD남!  "This ought to be fun," I thought to myself.  I had somehow
forgotten that I'd played the Amiga version of this game.  If I'd have
remembered, I wouldn't have opened the case and I surely wouldn't have
been excited.

TOTAL CARNAGE is a sequel of sorts to the arcade game SMASH TV, a
brilliant shooter game with a lot of bosses and power-ups.  However, 
TOTAL CARNAGE lacked the addictive properties as well as the personality 
of SMASH TV.  It just seemed to try too hard.  Nevertheless, it was fun 
to play in the arcade.

As good as the original SMASH TV was, it didn't translate very well for 
the Amiga when it was released in 1991.  It, however, managed to be a lot 
more playable than the abomination known as the CD남 version of TOTAL 
CARNAGE.

TOTAL CARNAGE would really have to kick some tail in the gameplay 
department to make up for its very poor graphics.  Unfortunately, it 
doesn't.  The player character looks like someone took Hulk Hogan's torso 
and put it on Pee Wee Herman's legs.  The animation is jerky and the 
response to controller movement is about nil.  

Did someone start a trend that made it fashionable for CD남 games to
emulate 8-bit game machines in terms of graphics?  TOTAL CARNAGE has some 
nice looking opening screens, but the game itself is nothing that the 
Nintendo Entertainment System or Sega Master System couldn't handle.  
(Those were the systems BEFORE the Super Nintendo and Genesis.)  Where 
are the 32-bit games?

The game is no different than the Amiga version, which is really a let
down.  I don't know what I expect to make it better on the CD남 other
than possibly a complete rewrite or, at the least, better controller 
response.  

I.C.E. is repsonsible for two other CD남 shooter games, FIRE FORCE and 
DEEP CORE.  I recommend buying either one of those before picking up 
TOTAL CARNAGE.  Actually, I recommend a lot of other games (even those for
other systems) before you even think about getting TOTAL CARNAGE.

@NODE GAME6 "Quick Capsule Reviews"
This is a quick glance at some games I had a chance to play for a bit, but
didn't get a chance to do a complete review of:

HEIMDALL 2 - (CD남)
A cartoon-style adventure game with puzzles that are sure to give even
the most dedicated adventurers headaches.  This is the kind of game the
CD남 really needed, but I hesitate to say this title is the best of its 
kind.  It's not for everyone.  The control is sometimes clumsy and the 
puzzles are sometimes TOO hard.  Overall, it's engaging but mostly 
frustrating.

OVERALL RATING: 75%      Video Mode: PAL


VALHALLA - (Amiga)
This overhead view adventure game bills itself as one of the first Amiga
games to make extensive use of speech.  While that is true, it doesn't add
a whole lot to the game.  The speech merely performs functions that text
used to do (and text did it without becoming as annoying.)  Still,
VALHALLA is a moderately challenging brain-teaser.  Worth owning only
because of the lack of really good adventure games lately.

OVERALL RATING: 79%      Video Mode: PAL

@NODE RATINGS "The Ratings - Explained"

We judge the games we review in four different categories:

Graphics
--------
This is pretty self explanatory.  The higher the percentile, the better
the graphics are.

Sound
-----
Another no-brainer.  The higher the percentile, the better the sound. 
Although, this also relates to it's coordination with the gameplay.  If 
the sound seems inappropriate for the type of game it is, the game will
score lower in the Sound category even if the sounds are technically well
done.

Gameplay
--------
The gameplay refers to the addictive quality of the game as well as the
way the game plays.  If you find your self sitting and watching rather
than interacting with the game, the game will score lower than one that
actually involves you.

Control
-------
This refers to how easy the game is to control given the control method
specified by the manufacturer. A game requiring a special controller 
that is not specified or not included will be penalized.  A game that 
comes with a special controller or one that recommends that, say, an 
Amiga mouse might work better than the standard CD남 controller will 
not be penalized.  A game that is programmed to use a mouse when a
joystick would be much more appropriate would also be penalized.  Of
course, a game that's just plain hard to control with any control method
will also feel the sting of the rating.

@NODE LGTM "Lame Game of the Month"
This is an award presented to one game per month for being the worst of
that month's issue.  It's mainly to warn you, the consumer, about a game
that's REALLY bad.

If we have an issue with no really bad games...there'll be no award given.

@NODE NEWS2 "Amiga News"
Here's the latest Amiga related news via that Information Superhighway
off-ramp known as USENET

New CD남 Games from Team 17 (from spadge@team17.demon.co.uk)
---------------------------

The long awaited (and hugely playable!) ARCADE POOL will be released for
CD32 in the next 10days or so... Featuring everything that the 
chart-topping floppy edition had, but with enhanced "pub-mosphere" audio 
tracks, animation and optional save to floppy for SX-1/AGA Machines with 
CD ROM.. unfortunately the save game file is 14K and that will _not_ fit 
in the NVRAM... Price is 14.99 rrp although you`ll be able to pick it up 
cheaper I guess. You will also be able to find a demo of Superfrog and 
Superstardust on there...

Also... SUPERFROG! for CD32 although this has no changes over the 
original, with demos of Pool and Super Stardust. Again, price is 14.99 
rrp UK Pounds.

Both titles are PAL.

@NODE RUM1 "AmigaWorld's 1-800 #"
This isn't a rumor, this is a fact!

AmigaWorld Magazine, with the help of its publisher, has set up an
information hotline to distribute information about the Commodore
liquidation.  

Call 1-800-441-4403 and ask for extension 365 to hear the latest
information about the Bahamian Supreme Court hearings.  (If you're calling
after business hours, simply type in 365 on a touch tone phone when 
prompted.)

Many thanks to AmigaWorld and TechMedia for setting this line up.  It will
quell a lot of rumors!

@NODE RUM2 "New Games For the Amiga"
The rumor mill has heard from a good source that Electronic Arts is
bringing some of it's EA SPORTS titles to the Amiga via it's UK division. 
Already successful with the Amiga translation of the Genesis game DESERT
STRIKE, EA is now bringing FIFA SOCCER and NHL HOCKEY to the Amiga.  FIFA
SOCCER may be available anytime (and has been previewed in several
European magazines).  NHL HOCKEY is soon to follow, but no release date is
yet known.

RISE OF THE ROBOTS, the fantastic ray-traced beat-'em-up game, IS coming
for the Amiga and CD남.  Contrary to what was originally believed, there
WILL be an ECS version of the game for the Amiga 500/600/1000/2000 and
3000 machines.  Look for them in October.

TFX, the long awaited flight simulator from Ocean, is due for release in
September for the CD남.  There may be an Amiga version too, but this was
not confirmed at press time.

SIMON THE SORCEROR for the CD남 will be available in an NTSC version. 
Originally, only a PAL version was planned.  Canadian and American
distributors felt that the game was going to be a huge seller because of
the way it uses the CD남's capabilities with CD music, actor's voices and 
improved graphics.  As a result, an NTSC version is being released for 
the North American market.

Because of time contraints, I was not able to do a proper review of the
SX-1 module.  So, scouring the Internet for information, I came across
this review from the COMP.SYS.AMIGA.REVIEWS base on Usenet.  The reviewer
did grant permission to use the review anywhere so long as the content not
be changed.  All I have done is edit it for formatting reasons, nothing
has been changed or deleted.

PRODUCT NAME

 SX-1 expansion


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

 Expand your CD남 to have almost all the specifications of an Amiga 1200.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

 Name:           Paravision, Inc.
 Address:        500 E. Arapaho, Suite 104
                 Richardson, Texas  75081
                 USA

 Telephone:      (214) 644-0043

 E-mail:         microbotics1@bix.com


LIST PRICE

 Unknown.  I was impatient, so I paid $249 (US) at a local dealer.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

HARDWARE

 Requires a CD남.

SOFTWARE
        
 Well, it needs some version of AmigaDOS.


COPY PROTECTION

 None.  (Unless you call the SX-1 itself a big dongle. :-))


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        CD남.
        1 MEG SIMM.
        Two Floppy Drives.
        A cheap AT keyboard.
        AmigaDOS 3.0.


INSTALLATION

 To install the SX-1 on the CD남, you must remove the back plate of
the CD남 and gently slide the SX-1 onto the expansion bus.  Very simple.

   [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  If you are not comfortable opening up your
   Amiga, then you should have the work done by an authorized Amiga
   service center.  Opening your Amiga yourself may void your warranty,
   and careless work may even damage the machine.  - Dan]


REVIEW

 First, a comment.  This is a review after five days of actual
testing.  I wrote this review up very quickly because there is so much 
of a demand on the net for information about this product.  If I made 
some technical error, please send me the information that I messed up.  
I do not have the SX-1 in front of me while I am writing this up, so I 
am writing most of this from the top of my head.  If you disagree or 
don't quite think my opinion of this product is good, write your own 
review up.

 After calling the dealer many times, he finally confirmed that an
SX-1 finally came in.  After an hour drive there and a an hour drive back,
I excitingly took a look at the SX-1.  The SX-1 itself comes in a white 
box with just a sticker.  The guys at Paravision should learn a little 
about product packaging.  So I opened it up.  Inside is a a square box 
covered on three sides with various ports.  On the fourth is a connector 
for the CD남 and a pass-through port to connect up the MPEG module.  To 
place memory or an internal 2.5" hard drive into the SX-1, you must unscrew
the screws and open the module.  Inside, you will see two of our closest 
unchanged Amiga friends -- the CIA chips -- one socket for memory, and a 
44-pin 2.5" IDE connect.  The place to put the 2.5" hard drive is somehow 
supposed to fit underneath, but for the life of me I could not figure out 
how without causing possible physical problems.  So after putting the one 
meg 72-pin SIMM in the SX-1, we plugged it into the CD남 and were ready 
to go.


AT-PC KEYBOARD

 The SX-1 allows an IBM keyboard to be used on the CD남.  So I took
a standard PC keyboard and plugged it in.  The left and right Amiga keys 
were placed on F11 and F12, and Help was on print screen key.  Overall, 
it worked fine.


FLOPPY DRIVES
        
 I plugged two floppy drives in and booted directly from them.  They
work as well as I thought.  But I had problems when both floppies drives
were on the system.  One of them was a classic 1010 floppy drive by our
friends at Commodore, and in my opinion, it was pulling too much power 
from the power supply.  This caused some erratic behavior that was 
eliminated when I used only one drive.


RGB OUTPUT

 Flawless -- it worked great. I connected my multisync monitor to it,
and I was happy.  Finally, Microcosm could be enjoyed on a monitor instead
of a small television.


PARALLEL PORT/SERIAL PORT

 I printed a few documents, and it worked like I expected.  Now the
serial port is interesting as it is a nine-pin serial port.  This is 
slightly non-standard for an Amiga style serial port.  I hooked up a modem 
and it worked fine.


HARD DRIVE PORT

 This is a 37 pin IDE external hard drive port.  Very weird looking.
I have no experience with this type of connector!


KARAOKE MIKE/AUDIO INPUT

 Why is this on here?  It seems Paravision are trying to appeal to
more than one audience with this product :-) I myself did not use the
Karaoke port and probably never will!  But this is useful for people who
want to mix CD sound with live voice.  Could be great at parties.


NOW BACK TO THE REVIEW

 Like I stated before, I did not have a hard drive to check this unit
with so we tried a huge amount of floppy based software.  I took a 
selection of AGA euro demos, AGA games (Alien Breed II, Civilization AGA,
Overkill, Klondike AGA) and some non-AGA games (Cannon Fodder), a terminal
program, and a few other public domain programs.  Anything that ran on my
1200 worked great with SX-1.  No problems were encountered.  I ran off my
Workbench 3.0 disks from my 1200 and that was no problem.  Overall, 
compatibility with software was high.

 Now that I had a floppy drive, I took some of my favorite public
domain CD's and copied or viewed files from the CD-ROM.  You can access 
the drive by using the disk name or CD0:.  The CD-ROM access was 
transparent and quick.  I then put together a quick Parnet system and 
pulled information from the CD남 to my 1200 without a flaw.


DOCUMENTATION

 A two-page, double-sided booklet.  Not as bad my MBX1230 manual, but
still very thin on information.  I would prefer them to rewrite the whole
manual from scratch, as it is very poor.  For example, the manual should
include what keys on the AT keyboard are where compared to a regular Amiga
keyboard.  The documentation does tell you how to install the SX-1, and 
the rest of the manual is very much a summary of features of the SX-1.


LIKES

 Having some expansion for the CD남 is great.  It will definitely
help the CD남 sell.  By having even just the floppy drive expansion, it
allows CD남 owners access to thousands of Amiga software programs.  Cheap
AT keyboards can be used, and that saves money in my pocket.  Being able 
to use the CD남 on a monitor is like a dream!  Memory expansion just 
makes the CD남 scream:  play the Guardian demo or Frontier on CD남 and 
you will see what a difference.  According to SYSINFO 3.x, the system is
2.20 times faster than a stock 1200.  This expansion makes the CD남 into
a real computer!


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

 My first dislike is using a 9 pin serial port instead of a full
standard pin serial port.  It is very annoying for me to use the 9 pin
serial port instead of 25.

 When you open the lid of the CD남, the edge of the lid rubs the
SX-1.  I really don't like that.  Also the SX-1 looks as ugly as sin; I
mean, it is functional but it does not look very good.  And the connection
to the CD남 just seems very flimsy, I wish it were a little more 
protected.  A better manual and more attractive package should be 
considered almost as a must.

 And the other dislikes are lack of items on the SX-1.  I wish it had
a place to put a faster CPU and math coprocessor, a true 1200 expansion
slot, a PCMCIA slot, an alternate power supply, room for a 3.5" hard drive
inside the expansion box, a SCSI interface, an internal bay for floppy
drives, and include some version of WorkBench 3.1 with it.  I would have 
just loved to have the ability to have a MMU-based processor on this and 
run NETBSD... it would freak people out.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

 I have not seem a similar product, so I can't comment.


BUGS

 None that I found, except for lack of power, but I do not blame
Paravision for that problem.


VENDOR SUPPORT

 Didn't need it so I didn't call.  They do have a person active in
one of the CD남 Newsgroups.


WARRANTY

 One year warranty.


CONCLUSIONS

 This product will bring a CD남 owner up to specification with most
other Amiga owners.  Will it be the end all to CD남 expansion?  No.  
But it is very good and does what it claims.  I would recommend this 
product almost as a must to the owners of CD남 who have no Amiga.  But, 
because of the current prices, I would tell other AGA Amiga owners to 
think about it before you buy.

        I give it 4 stars out of 5.

INTRODUCTION
-=-=-==-=-=-
This was the game that made me decide to buy my CD남. With its wonderful
ray-traced pictures and ingeneous story, it is one of the best games I 
have ever seen on any machine. The one thing it lacks is character 
interaction. Besides that small flaw, this game is a piece of art.

But this file is not a review of the game (though I could go on and on 
about it). Since the game took us (Bruce and I) more than four months to 
solve, we decided to release a walkthru for the game. Why are we doing 
this? For the simple fact that there is none out there (at least one we 
could find) and we believe that others may benefit from this walkthru.

Before we start, I want to say thanks to a man who helped us out on the 
last half of the game. David Linzer, you were a big help to us. Thanks!

Lastly, all legal stuff is at the end of this file. Make sure you pay
attention to it so you don't get in a heap of trouble.

                                                         - Marc Buhmann

WALKTHRU
~~~~~~~~
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
(NOTE: Even though this is a "walkthru", we will not instruct you on how 
to get through every maze. The reason? Well, it would be pointless to 
tell you how to get through every maze since there is an auto-map maker 
in the game.  For example, if you have to go from the old west to the 
space station, we'd say something like "Okay... now that you've gotten 
the lantern in the old west, you must now head back to the space 
station." Now you wouldn't do this in the game, but it proved to be an 
acceptable example. Boy am I clear or what? =-)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
When you start, note that you have in your inventory a quarter and a map.
The map will map on its own, so if you want to get somewhere you have been
before, you can look at your map and see how to get there (one of my
"superb" descriptions).

Step 1  : Explore and map the first floor. Don't enter the Mirror Maze or
          the elevator yet. Some things you should note are...

            o Door south of subway car is screwed shut
            o Locked room across from the bathroom
            o Locked closet in room 14
            o Laundry chute in room to far south of hotel

Step 2  : Take elevator to the second floor. Explore and map this floor 
	  just as you did with the first floor. Some things you should 
	  note are...

            o Locked door to Detective Office
            o "15" puzzle in brick wall off of Movie Balcony
            o Descriptions on gravestones in cemetery (Old West)
            o Printing press in Newspaper Office (Old West)
            o Locked jail cell in Sheriff Office (Old West)
            o Drawer in desk in Sheriff Office contains a brass key. 
	      Take it.
            o Inside of mine is blocked by a "fallen" bridge section.

Step 3  : Return to room 14 on the first floor and use the brass key on 
	  the locked closet. Take the journal and card key. Read the 
          journal because it contains important information.

Step 4  : Enter and map the Mirror Maze. Do NOT waste your quarter on the
          mechanical fortune teller as you will need it later. You will 
	  exit the maze and enter a control room containing a teleporter.

Step 5  : Everytime you use the teleporter, you need to activate it with 
          the card key. Press the blue button and you are teleported to 
          the Moon Base Museum.

Step 6  : Explore and map the museum. Do the following...

            o Examine the six artifact cases for fun and occasional "in"
              jokes. Especially note the display case that someone tried 
              to break into.
            o You can take the alien belt, but it's not necessary. If you 
              do take it, wear it and turn it on
            o Pull all three levers (left to right) so they're in the down
              position. Apparently nothing happens but don't worry,
              something does

Step 7  : Go back to the transporter and press the green button. You will
          be teleported to a Satellite Library. Explore and map the 
          library.
          Read everything you can in the computer; it gives you lots of
          important information about King Minos, the Mayan Pyramid, the 
          Old West, etc...

Step 8  : At the far south of the library is another teleporter with a
          single button. It does not need the card key. Press the button 
          and you're teleported to a cave.

Step 9  : Continue exploring and mapping the Cretan Hall and Cretan Palace.
          Don't enter the Medieval Maze yet. Note the following...

            o To the north of the Cretan Hall is a bridge platform.
              Eventually you'll have to build a bridge from here to the
              floating structure in the distance
            o In the middle of the Cretan Palace is a large stone dish 
              that contains a Labrys (axe). Take it.
            o In the far west of the Cretan Palace is a locked door with 
              an unusual design in the door handle.

Step 10 : Enter the Medieval Maze and map it. Somewhere in the maze is a
          helmet. Take it and wear it. The Medieval Maze exits into a 
          Weird Cave.

Step 11 : The Weird Cave leads into the closet of a 1950's diner. In the
          closet is a can of paint and a brush. Take both these items.

Step 12 : Bypass the jukebox and go down the dim corridor. The room has a
          pay phone and the door to a restroom. You can also see the
          floating structure. Put the quarter into the payphone. The coin
          return will give you thirteen quarters back. Then use a quarter 
          to enter the restroom.

Step 13 : Once through the restroom door you will pop-up in a Hedge Maze.
          Explore and map it, then exit it on the opposite end from where
          you entered.

Step 14 : You will then be in a Contsruction Site. On the wall is a plaque
          with the solution to the "15" puzzle. Make sure you copy it down
          then take the electric screwdriver.

Step 15 : Return back to the 1950's Diner. Put a quarter into the jukebox
          then look in the coin return. You will receive a silver key. 
          Pick it up. Once you've done this, return to the lobby with the
          elevator. Watch out for these things:

            o If you haven't done so already, on the Mountain Road wear 
              the helmet to get past the falling rocks
            o When you get back to the two-button teleporter, push the
              orange button to return to the Mirror Maze
            o In the Mirror Maze, you may use all but one of the quarters 
              on the mechanical fortune teller. This is not necesary, 
              but itgives you some information and funny statements

Step 16 : Once you're back in the lobby where the elevator is, go up to 
          the second floor and use the silver key on the Detective Office 
          door.
          Pick up the iron key, the notes, and the falcon statue. The
          falcon statue is not needed to finish the game. Read the notes.

Step 17 : Go back to the Movie Balcony and solve the "15" puzzle.

Step 18 : Once the puzzle is solved, the wall will open. Go through and 
          you end up in the same Contruction Site you saw in the Hedge 
          Maze.  Except this is a part that was closed off. While in here, 
          take the gold key and the bicycle pump.

Step 19 : Go down to the first floor and back to hallway in front of the
          bathroom. Use the gold key on the locked door opposite the
          bathroom and enter it. In this room is a Stone Wall with a
          combination lock. You won't be able to open this for a little
          while longer so don't worry about it. Go into the next room and
          you'll find a broom, a pail, and some paper. You only need the
          paper.

Step 20 : Go back upstairs and to the Old West. Enter the Sheriff Office 
          and use the iron key to unlock the cell door. There is an empty
          revolver under the blanket on the bed. You can pick it up but it
          won't be of any use. But make sure that the door is unlocked!

Step 21 : Enter the mine and the "fallen" bridge section should be gone.
          (Pulling the levers in the Museum moved it) In its place should
          be a locked wooden door. Push the mining cart and it will smash
          through the door. Enter the room and you'll notice a sword in a
          stone. It is not necessary to take it, but you can if you wish. 
          It is there to distract you from the main object you need. Close 
          the door behind you and take the lantern hanging on the wall.

Step 22 : Now enter the Newspaper Office. Place the piece of paper on the
          printing press and operate it. You will then get a copy of (what
          else??) a newspaper. Take it.

Step 23 : Go back to the room across from the bathroom and place the
          newspaper on the table.

Step 24 : Head back to the subway car. You may discover that a bridge
          section has collapsed onto the subway car. If this has happened,
          head back to the Moon Base Museum and put all the levers back up
          into their original position. Then go back to the subway car. 
          The car will still be crushed, so use the bicycle pump three 
          times to inflate it. If the bridge section did NOT fall onto the 
          subway car, you have nothing to worry about. Enter it and go to 
          the door with the screw. Use the electric screwdriver on the 
          screw. Then take the screw and open the door.

Step 25 : You will end up in a Night-Time City Street scene. If you save a
          quarter from the many you had, you can buy a newspaper from the
          vending machine. Though this is not necessary, it still is very
          interesting to see. I recommend doing this. Then cross the 
          street against the red light.

Step 26 : Lightning will strike the street and a hole will open up. You 
          will fall into the Surreal Maze. This is the toughest maze in 
          the game and you may notice that the auto-map maker will not map 
          this maze.
          Since this is the hardest, we will explain how to get through 
          this maze. You will have to do it two more times after this.

            o Once in the T.V. room, turn right so the television is on 
              your left side. Go forward three (or more) times until you 
              come back into the T.V. room
            o Turn right and go forward three (or more) times until you
              enter the T.V. room yet again
            o Turn 180 degrees and go forward three (or more) times

Step 27 : You will find yourself at the enterance to the causeway to the
          Mayan Pyramid. After you cross the causeway you will find 
          yourself at the base of some stairs. There are two doors on 
          either side of you which are locked. Continue up the stairs. 
          There is a column at the top which you can move. Move it because
          it opens the doors below. Go back down and enter either of the 
          doors.

Step 28 : It is pitch black so light the lantern you found in the mine. 
          Then explore and map the interior of the pyramid. You will find 
          three levers in different parts of the pyramid. By one of the 
          levers is a dirty shirt. Take it. There is also a door in the 
          pyramid. You needn't worry about it since you'll never go in 
          there. Pull one of the levers and you'll be teleported to the 
          Bridge Platform. You should notice that one of the bridge 
          sections is in place. Go all the way back to the Mayan Pyramid 
          and pull one of the other levers. You'll be teleported back to 
          the Bridge Platform and you should notice that a second section 
          of the bridge is in place. Go back to the Mayan Pyramid a third 
          time and pull the last lever.  You'll be teleported once again 
          to the Bridge Platform and you'll notice that the bridge is 
          complete.

Step 29 : Cross the bridge and enter the Floating Structure. This is the
          center of the labyrinth. But it is guarded by a Minotaur. The
          Minotaur is created by beams of light from the two mirrors on
          either side of the entry door. Use the can of paint on one of 
          the mirrors. The Minotaur partially fades, but is still there.

Step 30 : Go back to the hotel and drop the dirty shirt in the laundry
          chute. Then return to the room where you placed the old west
          newspaper on the table. There is now a clean shirt next to the
          paper.

Step 31 : Read the journal you found in the closet of room 14. The
          combination for the door in the stone wall is hidden in the new
          entry of the journal. The combination is the friends birthday,
          April 8, 1872 (04-08-72). Enter this combination into the lock.

Step 32 : Once the door opens, enter. You are in King Minos's Tomb. You 
          find a skeleton, a hat, and a sarcophagus in the room. You can 
          take the hat and wear it, but you don't need to. Open the 
          sarcophagus and take the artifact. Recognize the shape? Remember 
          the weird shape on the lock in the Cretan Palace? Go back there.

Step 33 : Place the artifact in the weird shape on the lock. The door will
          open, so enter it.

Step 34 : You are now in a Throne Room. Push the throne to one side to
          reveal a alcove containing a can of paint. Take the paint and
          return to the Minotaur.

Step 35 : Paint over the remaining mirror. Then look at where the Minotaur
          once was. Recognize the shape? Place the Labrys in it. Once this
          is done, the Keystone is revealed.

Step 36 : Goto the Moon Base Museum and examine the artifact case someone
          tried to break into. Take the Mayan Talisman. When you do this an
          alarm will sound. Head back to the teleporter.

Step 37 : No matter which button you press, the teleporter will send you to
          the jail cell in the Old West. Open the cell (this is why you
          unlocked it before) and head back to the center of the labryinth.

Step 38 : Use the Mayan Talisman on the Keystone. Then sit back and watch
          the end sequence of The Labryinth of Time.

@NODE HOWTO "How to get listed in the AEM Dealer Listing"

If you're an Amiga dealer or CD남 dealer, big or small, please send
us your business' name, address, telephone number and fax number to be

where accessories and software can be found.

Readers are also encouraged to submit dealer information.  With the Amiga
community in danger of losing dealers, we need to know where to find one
when we need one.  Support your local Amiga dealer!  (The prices may not
always be as low as mail order, but the service is face-to-face and
they'll really appreciate it!)
