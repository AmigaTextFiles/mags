Dear visitor,

<br><br>

You are probably here looking for clickBOOM web site and info on our latest game developments. 

Unfortunately, the only news we can report is the worst news of all - clickBOOM as a development team 

does not exist anymore.<br><br>

The inevitable has happened, and we have to go. We might be back one day, in some better, more  

peaceful future. Until then, we will be missing each and every one of you, for you were our 

inspiration.
