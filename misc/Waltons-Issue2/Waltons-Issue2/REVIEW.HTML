The following programs are reviewed by <B>ME</B>, and are my own
personal opinions on them. They may disagree with the programmer,
user or anyone else who has an interest in them. If you don't like
what I say them <I>FLAME</I> me, otherwise take them as a hands on
honest opinion.<P>

<H2><B>AMIGA REPORT</B></H2><P>
<A HREF="areport.gif"> CLICK HERE FOR PREVIEW</A><p>
I now get this magazine sent to me by e-mail, as opposed to downloading
it from AMINET. I find this a good source of information, and its use
of the AmigaGUIDE format makes it easy to navigate. It's also nice
that it's kept going through the recent turmoil that CBM, and now Amiga
Technologies are/were going through.<p>
If you have not read it, then I suggest you give it a try. And i'd
recommend that if you enjoy it, then use your E-Mail to your advantage, and
have it posted to your doorstep (so too speak!)<p>

E-Mail - you either love it or never use it. Me i'm getting into it and
see that it has a number of advantages for me. There are a number of E-Mail
programs about, but this is the first one that I have felt realy at home with.
It has a nice interface (MUI Based - don't mail me with your views on MUI!)
and is layed out in a very easy to understand format. The registration is easy,
the programmer helpful and it is a very slick package. My one gripes has to
do with the fact it currently uses POP3 for getting mail, something my
provider does not support. So I can only send mail with this program and 
have to read my mail with something else. At the moment I can live with this, and
I have mailed the programmer who hopefully will implement the SMTP get-mail as 
well as send mail. Worth getting.<p>

<H2><B>CU AMIGA MAGAZINE - SUPER CD-ROM II</B></H2><P>
Okays. CD-Roms are good. You get lots of information, all on one disk and
they are relatively cheap. CU AMIGA brought out their first CD-ROM in
November 1995 and it contained MOST of the AMINET#7 disk. VERY good value
for the money, and a disk I still look at. BUT - <p>
SUPER CD-ROM II is another kettle of fish.<p>
It runs along a totaly different theme. It has a number of demos, programs
to whet the appetite and hopefully get you to buy the full product. It's an
interesting combination but I think that there are alot of items that i'd
never look at. Which is a shame as I think it will see less use than their
first disk which was excellent. There are some things on it I will use, but
most of the disk will be looked at and forgotten. Shame ... <p>

<H2><B>AWEB 1.0</B></H2><P>
<A HREF="aweb.gif"> CLICK HERE FOR PREVIEW</A><p>
I have been hearing about this program for a while. Infact on a certain
Amiga site, everytime I tried to access the home page my system crashed.
Finaly I managed to have a look at it on the above mentioned CD (see I
said there were some things I liked ..). Then I saw this version on AMINET
and ever since I have been using it in preference to 'other' web browsers.<p>
I dunno, maybe its the fact I can read pages whilst the GFX are loading.
Maybe it's because I can read the Recent Aminet Uploads whilst downloading
a file, not have the screen freeze on me, and only read what else is there after
the file has been saved, maybe because it's easier to configure, maybe maybe
maybe.<p>
Yep you guessed it, another program that I'd whole heartedly recommend to
anyone wanting to do their Internetting via Web Browsers. Me, i'm caught
in this programs web ...<p>
