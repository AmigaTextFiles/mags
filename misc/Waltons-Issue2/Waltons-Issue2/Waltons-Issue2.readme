April 1996 : Second Issue of a Fanzine losely based on
the BBS I used to run. Thought i'd channel my time into 
something a little more glamorous. Will now create ISSUES
as opposed to MONTHLY editions.

Anyone want to contribute??

Anyone who write some BBS s/w that uses the HTML format will 
get a sale from me!!
