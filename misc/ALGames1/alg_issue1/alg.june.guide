                    @{b}@{fg shine} THE ENTERTAINMENT EDITORIAL PAGE @{ub}@{fg text}
 
     Welcome to the first issue of @{i}AMIGA LINK GAMES@{ui} - your hot new source
for gaming and entertainment information.  Within the screens of this
magazine, we pledge to give you accurate dependable reviews, the hottest new
gaming rumors, the most up to the minute release dates on titles, cheats &
solves, and much more.  Those of you who are familiar with the @{i}DARK UNICORN
DISPATCH NEWSLETTER@{ui} will feel right at home here, since this disk mag is now
its replacement.  All the witty editorials (shameless self promotion), the
latest on up and coming Dark Unicorn Productions projects, and all the other
good stuff can now be found in these pages.  We have liberated ourselves
from the burdens of having to deal with productivity and hardware (read our
sister magazine @{i}AMIGA LINK@{ui} for that good stuff) and can fully concentrate on
the gaming aspect of the Amiga.  We figure that about 75%+ originally bought
your Amiga to play kick butt games on, so you are our audience. 
 
     Although the title says GAMES, ALG will be there to cover the latest in
entertainment also.  In addition to the @{"FUTURE ENTERTAINMENT" link "FUTURE" 0} column, we will
also cover the hottest new AGA and ECS mega demos on the scene, as well as
cover any other area of entertainment that is lacking.  As always, we are
VERY responsive to reader comment and will be happy to review a game for you
or add a section that everyone has always wanted.  As time goes on, we will
hopefully get large enough for me to get some good IRC interviews with some
of the top game programmers like @{fg shine}TEAM 17, OCEAN, and VISION/ACID@{fg text} (you guys
listening out there?  FREE advertising for you...)   
 
     For those of you who loved the @{i}DUP DISPATCH@{ui} magazine for our articles
on AMOS PROGRAMMING and such, many of these type columns will be moving to
AL instead.  The INTERNET column is one such column.   
 
     Many people may be confused why we decided to segregate the mediums
like this.  The answer is several fold.  First, games coverage in disk mags
so far has been limited and done as sort of an 'obligatory' thing.  We
believe that doing anything half-assed is far worse than doing anything at
all, so an entertainment only magazine makes sense.  Second, although there
are some great disk mags out there, you usually get about a ratio of 80% to
20%; the 20% being games coverage.  We KNOW there are people out there like
us who really don't CARE about the latest C++ compiler or the revisions made
to @{fg shine}WORDSWORTH 3.0@{fg text} or how crappy the @{fg shine}e586 EMPLANT@{fg text} module is. We bought the
Amiga to have FUN and play games;  not emulate an inferior platform.
Finally, everyone needs competition.  AL on its own was a fine magazine, but
needed to grow a bit in entertainment.  Other mags (that shall remain
nameless ;) also seemed to be lacking a bit too, but were still very
popular.  By combining the great entertainment information from @{i}DISPATCH@{ui} and
the cool hot information in AL in seperate mags under one name, we can give
EVERYONE what they want.  I am sure there are professionals out there who
could give a rat's ass about when@{fg shine} MEGARACE CD32@{fg text} is coming out or how kick
ass the intro to @{fg shine}TOWER ASSAULT@{fg text} is or even how playable @{fg shine}ROADKILL CD32@{fg text} is.
These people will also benefit from the split. 
 
     Those of you familiar with @{i}DISPATCH@{ui} and have read my previous
editorials know how CRUEL I can be to some companies and how much I pump
others.  Hey, EDITORIALS and REVIEWS are all opinion columns. ALG gets no
kickbacks from any company nor will be take a personal vendetta against a
company (unless they REALLY piss us off) and will give you honest dependable
opinions.  Those who know me KNOW I do not mince words. If a game or company
SUCKS, believe me;  you will be the first to know.  Which brings me to BCI.

 
     @{i}Better Concepts Inc.@{ui} is a fine upstanding Amiga mailorder (soon to be
showroom) retail business that cares MORE about the Amiga than just about
ANY company I know.  This is why @{i}DUP@{ui} is affiliated with them;  I liked their
style.  They go whole hog into the Amiga market and offer some of the most
remarkable deals around (when was the last time you saw  @{fg shine}BRILLIANCE 2.0@{fg text} for
$55?).  @{i}BCI@{ui} handles all our lisenseware products (registered versions of our
games) and well as provides a TON of our review material.  I am also an
employee of the company, so I can't say I am 100% unbiased.  However, you
will ALWAYS get fair and accurate reviews of @{i}BCI@{ui} and @{i}DUP@{ui} stuff.  I run @{i}DUP@{ui}
but EVERY program has highs and lows.  We will show you both sides.  I may
promote them a lot, but they DO give us a lot of stuff. 
 
     Anyway, enough of that crap.  Everyone is probably asleep and drooling
all over their keyboard with the system beeps ringing out telling you to get
your chin off the space bar, so let's get on with the MEAT of the editorial.
One last thing.  There are several issues of back @{i}DISPATCH@{ui} mags available on
good BBS's and the Aminet.  We have covered a LOT of ground in those issues.
In most cases, we will not repeat reviews or articles that are contained in
these back issues, even though we have a new audience. All the back issues
of @{i}DUP DISPATCH@{ui} are available on any AmiNet Mirror site in the docs/mags
directory.  Check them all out.  You'll love'em. 
 
     Summertime is in the air and it is typical of things to slow down
everywhere in the computer industry.  The Amiga is not immune to summer
fever and things have indeed slowed down since last month. Fortunately,  we
at least have lights at the end of the tunnel with @{fg shine}ESCOM@{fg text} leading the Amiga
back into glory. 
 
     For those of you who may not live in the IRCs on the Internet like we
do, I will summize quickly what the word is from @{fg shine}ESCOM@{fg text} about the future of
Amiga gaming.  First, there are gonna be plenty of A1200s available on store
shelves the remainder of 1995 starting about September.  A4000s on the other
hand, all seem spoken for already.  There will be many thousand CD32 units
available also althought there is no official word on FMV cards. However, we
have been promised a NEW game console (CD32 compatible from the sound of it)
that will rival the new systems like Saturn and Playstation around the first
quarter of 1996.  Sorry, no specs yet, but will keep you informed. @{fg shine}CEI@{fg text}
informed me that they are making new FMV cards for the CD32 as is another
nameless company in the UK.  See May's issue of @{i}DISPATCH@{ui} for more info on
this.  Anyway, it is looking GOOD for gamers in @{fg shine}AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES@{fg text}' future.

 
     Speaking of reborn, the future Amiga CD32 owners might get a chance  to
see a little DUP in action.  @{i}BCI@{ui} approached @{fg shine}ESCOM@{fg text} with a proposal to package
their bundled software with the future CD32s and Amiga CD-ROMs. @{fg shine}ESCOM@{fg text} was
quite receptive and apparently asked BCI for a demo cd of their work. They
turned to yours truly to create this CD in a very short period of time.
Since almost all @{i}DUP@{ui} members live apart, I got some of the finest people
locally to assist me in the task.  The CD came together with some hard
hitting @{fg shine}IMAGINE@{fg text} raytraced animations, cool tunes, some rather slick
programming (shameless self promotion), and the greatest of freely
distributed software we could put our hands on.  There will be certainly
more to report by the time you read this. 
 
     Now that the basic fate of Amiga is decided, we need to start pumping
@{fg shine}ESCOM@{fg text} with the tools, ideas, concepts, and assistance they need to succeed
here and abroad.  @{i}DUP@{ui} through @{i}BCI@{ui} is trying to do their part; everyone else
needs to do theirs.  Write the developers and tell them what you want to see
happen.  Like I said before;  money talks - but it don't sing and dance and
it don't walk - you will have to do that part. 
 
     That is about it from this end.  Remember, we always listen, so feel
free to write us and tell us your opinions about the Amiga, @{fg shine}ESCOM,@{fg text} @{i}DUP,@{ui} @{i}AL,@{ui}
@{i}BCI,@{ui} or whatever.  If enough people write, we will have a forum just for
reader letters.  It is up to you!

                           @{i} By Shane R. Monroe@{ui} 
 
     Yep, things slow down in the summer.  Programmers seem to like to get
outdoors after all (contrary to popular belief) when the sun shines so
things get to drag on.  Since there isn't much to talk about, we will hit
some of the stuff about DUP and BCI. 
 
     ... @{fg shine}TOMCAT@{fg text} developer John Graham has been away from the scene a bit. He
made a move to Columbia, South Carolina and has been living up on the
Internet under the nickname VIRTUAL.  I am sure you have seen him around.
Well, since he made so much money on @{fg shine}TOMCAT,@{fg text} a followup "sequel" was bound
to happen.  I just got off the phone with him and the next FMV game will be
a helicopter combat game.  Expect all the same hard hitting action that
@{fg shine}TOMCAT@{fg text} offered, with some "other" goodies yet to be revealed.  THIS GAME IS
NOT IN B&W!  We'll give you more exclusive coverage next issue. (Better yet,
@{"CLICK HERE" system "ppshow dapache"} to see a screen snapshot of the game!) 
 
     ... Those of you waiting for @{fg shine}FLYING TIGERS;@{fg text} I can just tell you to hold
on a bit longer.  Believe me the wait will be worth it. I just got a new
Alpha version of it last week and I must say that it is taking HUGE strides
in all aspects including graphics, animation, gameplay, controls and just
everything.  He has finished (more or less) the first real mission and he
has completed most of the in-game effects (things like storms, lightning,
speech, etc).  Fantastic stuff.  This game will be a legend. For those who
missed it before, @{fg shine}FT@{fg text} is sort of like an helicopter arcade simulation.  In
fact, we thought it good enough to do a full  preview for you which is in
the SHAREWARE REVIEWS area.  Just playing it makes me drool for the final
version (much like the hilarious game @{fg shine}KOCKFIGHTERS@{fg text} -don't ask- I just had
the pleasure to preview) and when the final elements are in place, @{fg shine}FT@{fg text} will
end up being more like an experience than a game.  Still no firm release
date yet.  There are some early pictures of the game available. Check out
the Aminet or your favorite BBS for the file DUP_PROMO.LHA. 
 
     ... Just heard from Troy Toulou, currently deep to his knees in coding
his self-proclaimed "QUICKEN killer" @{fg shine}EASY MONEY.@{fg text} The core version  (basic
home financial stuff) should be available this summer at the latest. The
other modules (tax preperation, portfolios, etc) will follow soon.  I
wouldn't normally bring up something as BORING as financial management but
it IS a @{i}DUP@{ui} product! :) 
 
     ... Ever wonder what happened to good ol' Michael Welch of @{fg shine}SCORCHED
TANKS@{fg text} fame?  Well, heck, even though he works under the @{i}DUP@{ui} label I hadn't
heard a peep from him in months.  Seems that he is working on a little
version of @{fg shine}SCORCHED TANKS@{fg text} for the PC using C++. Well, no accounting for
taste, but at least they will have a decent artillery game now <wink>.
Seriously, he is not going to dump the Amiga side of the game, but I
wouldn't expect to see anything major for awhile from him.  He is in totally
undiscovered country over there on the dark side and it will take him some
considerable time to get things done there.  Hopefully he will get back to
making us ST 2.0 soon.  @{fg shine}(NOTE: Many people don't realize that a new version
of ST was released just recently to AmiNet (V1.85) which is a TON better
than 1.77.  Check it out.)@{fg text} 
 
     ... Sean Anderson, @{i}DUP@{ui}'s newest member, is working hard on his wargame
editor.  Most people from other platforms bitch that there are not enough
quality wargames out there for the Amiga and that we are a total arcade
platform game machine.  Sean, wargame fanatic, is about to change all that
with his new program.  Sound interesting?  Well, here is the feature list
and 'brag sheet' as provided by the author. 
 
                                    ***** 
 
                           @{fg shine}The War Game Processor

  PROMO:  Attention All Board War Gamers and Armchair Strategists!  Can't
find opponents for Third Reich?  Not enough room to set up your World in
Flames maps?  All that play by mail paperwork got you down?  Does the cat
keep wiping out your Russian Front?  Happy days are here!  DUP's upcoming
War Game Processor will sweep all your board wargame worries away! 
 
   @{fg shine}The War Game Processor@{fg text} does for Board War Gamers what the word processor
did for secretaries!  Your favorite wargame can be played on computer, using
a user friendly graphic interface.  Positions can be saved to disk, as well
as detailed histories of where each unit moved in the previous turn or
phase.  These can be sent e-mail to your opponent, who will be able to
replay the turn, even seeing your comments as play unfolds!  Or maybe your
opponent doesn't have the program?  That's okay, because the War Game
Processor can generate plain English turn summaries in text form!  All you
do is make your moves.  That means you can dispense with the reams of
paperwork involved with play by mail and do what you came to do in the first
place: Play wargames! 
 
   Your game will be played on the screen, with a scrolling mapboard big
enough to handle most popular games.  Even the super-monster boardgames like
the Europa series can use the War Game Processor, if you have enough memory!
Units are moved by simply double-clicking on a stack, or you may select
individual units from within a stack, then double clicking on their
destination!  Hex by hex movement may be recorded by single clicking on
interim points along the way!  At any time, you can write a comment,
clarification, description or just plain witticism which will appear when
your opponent replays your  moves! 
 
   @{fg shine}The War Game Processor@{fg text} also comes with an intuitive, easy to use editor,
which allows you to generate modules for any game you like!  YOU draw the
map, YOU decide what terrain features look like, YOU create the units.  The
editor features an easy point-and click  interface for laying down hex
images from a customizable library.  Units can be assigned individual names
and 6 numeric values, and their visual representation is limited only by
your artistic ability!  Built in graphics editing tools allow you to draw
new hexes and units,  or alter those that come with the default libraries.
Graphics  templates for hexes and units may be imported from and exported to
standard IFF templates, allowing you to do additional editing using your
favorite paint program! 

  Keep a close eye for a full review in next issue!

     ... What?  @{fg shine}FLEET COMMANDER?@{fg text}  Boy, do I ever hear flack about this.
Alright, here is the scoop.  Even though I had about 40% of @{fg shine}FC@{fg text} done, I have
decided that an entire re-write is gonna be needed.  Why?  Well, I want to
do this kinda of game RIGHT for a change and although the version I have
right now is pretty cool, I have decided to do it a bit different.   I
originally planned to make a a very souped up version of the original "star
trek" type game with the 10x10 galaxy and x number of Klingons to kill in y
stardates with z starbases remaining type game.  Of course, full motion
video was to play a big part of that.  Now, instead of FMV, I am more
interested in adding RAYTRACED graphics and animations in the game.  Be
warned;  the system requirements are going to be a bit higher for this game
that my previous ones.  I want to do the game in hi-res for most of the non
and slow moving screens, so having an accelerator or at least a 1200 with
some fast ram will be almost a requirement.  Hard Drive is likely to be a
requirement this time too.  It is the 90's, folks, and these are things that
PCs have been using for years now.  No more floppy based games for me. Fear
not, though, it will be in NTSC and it will be ECS/AGA compatible. 
 
     ... @{i}DUP@{ui} member Shane R. Monroe (er, uhm, that's me) just got finished
creating the ultimate Adult CD for the Amiga.  Distributed by @{i}BCI@{ui} (of
course) this CD is loaded with cool *AMIGA* pictures and *AMIGA* animations
with a full blown decked out *AMIGA* interface.  If you are tired of crappy
PC CDs then check this title out.  It is not being sold under the DUP label
(hey, we are a family programming company) it is being sold as a BCI
in-house CD under the name @{fg shine}YOUR PRIVACY ASSURED@{fg text} and guess what?  It is U.K.
legal (that doesn't make it tame, though) so all of you in England who have
been waiting for a quality CD, wait no more!  Reviews will be available as
soon as it hits the shelves (probably by the time you read this). 
 
     ... Last month (in @{i}Dark Unicorn Dispatch@{ui}) we talked about all the cool
stuff that is coming for the Amiga and CD32 (check out May Edition;  it has
some awesome info) and it seems this month is all @{i}DUP@{ui} stuff.  As of the time
you are reading this, I will be in charge of @{i}BCI's@{ui} entire PD library
section.  In other words, if you order PD stuff from them, it will likely be
me copying and shipping it to you.  The PD system they currently have will
be revised to incorporating everything on CD (about 60% of it is now) and
the CDs will be available for purchase.  In addition to their already
rapidly growing library, my own PERSONAL PD collection will be added to
theirs, giving us the strongest PD arm in the U.S.  A new catalog should be
available in the middle of the summer and expect a hypermedia
catalog-on-disk to appear here and on the Aminet.  If you have any
suggestions for the PD business, feel free to pass them along.  I will be
looking to improve the speed of service and the amount of service including
custom world wide searchs for those really odd and hard to find PD titles.

  Scorched Tanks (ST) has had a active past, hasn't it?  From its humble
origins to the mega cool tank game it is now, it has come a long way. In
fact, it is still one of the most popular Amiga Shareware games ever. Its
latest incarnation is, as always, a welcome addition to anyone's collection.
For those of you who have a previous version (1.77 seems to be the most
popular) you can skip the next paragraph, as it is only for those not
familiar with the game. 

  ST is a 'artillery' type of game.  Based on the old ARTILLERY system where
two 'stations' fired projectiles at each other by setting the angle of the
gun and the amount of powder (or force) that the shot would fire.  It was a
neat concept at first (hell, MS-DOS 6.22 still has a version of it for
MS-BASIC included with it called GORILLAS) but it became apparent that
forces like wind, gravity, etc. should play a part in the game as well.
Soon, the sort of game merged into a PC game called SCORCHED EARTH. Michael
Welch seized the concept and ST was born and FAR surpassed its predecessor.
Where as there were only a handful of weapons in Scorched Earth, there were
just DOZENS on weapons for ST.  Since the PC never was much good at screen
scrolling, all the players had to play on the same screen.  Not so with ST;
the screen can scroll so your playfield is many times bigger than the
playscreen (based on Chip RAM space).  ST is a four player game vice
Scorched Earth's 10, but in my humble opinion, anything more than four is a
waste anyway because with THAT many players, you can't HELP but to hit
someone.  ST also introduced a handful of great dynamic shields which did
things like repel, displace, or even absorb the enemies shots. 

  Since the early days, ST has become even better.  There are now 70 (!)
weapons to purchase as well as 13 shield types to buy.  You can select the
starting cash you have on hand as well as Computer tank's intelligence and
aggressiveness.  ST now offers a 64 color map to play on (1 meg Chip RAM is
required) and is still ECS compatible.  Other options include setting
explosion size, gravity, wind, etc.  There are several new tank DEATHS that
occur when the player dies (I won't spoil them for you) as well. Another
feature is the trails behind the shots as they travel.  Some people like it,
some don't.  I personally like it. 

  The game has taken an enormous step forward in asthetics.  Everything
looks a bit cleaner, smoothed out.  The music is better and it has a cool
short intro to it.  It is almost like it crossed a very definetive line
where it is closing in on "textbook" commercial quality. 

  The biggest question on everyone's lips I will bet is what kind of new
weapons are there.  How about I give you some names and let YOU figure them
out?  SUNBURST, MARK 4, MARK 8, TOMMYGUN, MINIGUN, PINEAPPLE, and of course
there are MORE.  The evaluation version is FREE, so pick it up and see for
yourself.  The evaluation version is V1.85 and the registered version is
V1.90.  The only things different are the ability to play more than 5 rounds
and the ability to save the game in progress.  These are minor and there is
NOTHING to distract you from good playing in the eval version. 

  As good as it is, ST still has a couple of things that I couldn't, in all
fairness, fail to mention (journalistic integrety and all that).  

  First, the Weapons Link (where you purchase your weapons and shields) is
still a bit primitive.  It has the customary slider and arrows, but it sure
could use more of a face lift and some cool goodies like moving to the
beginning or end of the list with the right mouse button clicking on the
arrows.  Sure, you can grab the scroller and move it, but this would be
easier.  A custom loadout (saved under the player's name) would be great,
since almost everyone buys about the same basic stuff each turn.  Make it to
where you buy your basics (big shots, parachutes, cruballs, etc) then store
it on a hot button on the weapon link so that you can just click that for a
basic load out.  Alphabetizing the list would be a good step too. 

  Multi-machine playability would almost be a must for the next generation
of ST.  Modem, network, internet, or even null modem would be great as an
option.  Michael told me it would be FAR to difficult to get that working in
the this environment, but I think he could pull it off. 

  It is easy to see how a programmer's machine gets upgraded as he writes
newer programs.  This new version sports more colors and effects, but the
cost is speed.  Don't get me wrong;  it is playable on a vanilla machine.
BUT, on a no Chip RAM based machine it can get REALLY slow (especially
during the TOMMYGUN/MINIGUN type weapons).  Fast RAM is much easier to bear.
If you have an accelerated machine, prepare for a real treat.  The A4000/040
plays it almost TOO fast, and an 020/14+Fast RAM or 030/25 is about right. 

  There are still some MAJOR bugs floating around in the game, but you are
very unlikely to see them unless you are a die hard 'play-every-day' kinda
person.  The best way to see the bugs is to use a lot of plastic based
weapons and rebounding type shields.  Shot vanish or blow up in the wrong
places sometimes, but not enough for you to really care. 

  HD installability is easy.  You just drag the drawer into the HD drawer
you want it in, or use your favorite util to copy the files over. 

  In closing, let me say that this game really kicks ass and you need to get
it if you are even REMOTELY interested in it.  Pay the man his money and
clear your conscience, too.  It isn't as much a game for the unexpanded
Amiga anymore, but this *IS* the 90's and if you don't have a machine with
Fast RAM, a Meg or Two of Chip RAM, and/or an accelerator, you are a bit
behind the times.  Upgrade and play Scorched Tanks.  You will be glad you
did.

  JetStrike CD32 is one of my favorite games of the platform.  It combines a
bit of strategy with lots of hard hitting arcade action.  When I first saw
the Alpha version of FLYING TIGERS (FT) I was immediately reminded of
JetStrike.  Both are similar in design but have different features about
them that I like. 

  FT is a horizontal scrolling shoot'em-up that draws off the best ideas of
several games.  First, and foremost, is the arcade side of the game.  You
fly your helicopter over various missions and take out the designated
targets with various weaponry.  Simple, but it has been done before   Where
FT starts to change is the 'accompanyment' that can be yours for the asking.
These take the form of wingmen and air support. 

  During the startup of the game, you may select one of many different
helicopters to fly as well as fill the weapon slots with applicable weapons.
Then, you may select your WINGMEN (up to two choppers to accompany you) as
well as a jet craft to come in and help out too.  Your own arsenal is
usually inadequate to make the mission alone, so it is useful to have some
of these guys with you.  You have a limited inventory of craft, so once they
are destroyed, you lose. 

  Lots of care has been taken in the asthetic portion of the game.  It has a
nice clean special effects intro (a movie like intro is rumored to preceed
the game later) and everything is just smooth.  The menus are unique and the
pointer has that 'real life' feel to it during menu selection.  Loads of
missions will be on the game (I have seen only a couple). Many options to
set up based on your processor and machine are given. You can manually alter
the game speed or let FT choose the best guess for your system.  You can set
all the game parameters like sound, music, etc on/off as well as choose a
controller type (if you don't have a CD32 controller yet, get one folks;
games are going that way).  With the CD32 controller like is GOOD while you
blast the hell out of everything.  FT is playable, though, with a standard
one button controller. 
 
     In addition to everything else, the game throws in some little
digitized radio communications - which adds greatly to the atmosphere of the
game.  With that comes parallax clouds and even rain/lightning storms. Cool,
huh.  You can be hit by lightning too, and that is pretty radical. 
 
     Do I sound a bit excited for it?  You bet.  It has been a long time
coming but I am sure it will be WELL worth it!  ALG will have the exclusive
review as soon as it comes out!

     Pac-Man has come a long way since the early 80's.  What the world saw
in this little yellow circle (eyes came later) and those stupid colored
ghosts is beyond me.  The same maze, the same monsters, and the same dots.
The only thing that changed was the little fruit in the middle. Yee haw, as
they say in the south.  Yet, somehow, people dumped billions of quarters
into Bally/Midways' energizer chomping loser. 
 
     Some time later, they finally came around and made the first pac man
game with changing mazes (Ms. Pac), then the scrolling mazes (Pac Man Jr)
and my personal favorite, Pac Man Plus where all sorts of weird things
happened like the maze vanished, the dots all turned to energizers, the
ghosts repealed against you, etc.  That was pretty cool. 
 
     Finally, Pac Man enters the 90's.  Now, in the age of video game
secrets and hidden gems, DELUXE PACMAN surfaces, bringing us all the things
we ever wanted in  Pac Man from the start.  What's more, it is done in
style. 
 
     Now we get it all;  changing mazes, special powerups like FREEZE, GLUE,
SPEEDUP, and tons more.  BUT, the best part of all is the ultimate power up
- the GUN!  That's right.  Pac Man is packing.  And he is pissed off.  Now,
for a limited time, you can grab that Glock 7 and blast those annoying
ghosts into nothing.  Of course, they ALWAYS come back in due time, but damn
is it ever gratifying to blow them away.  Unfortunately they didn't cater to
the evil side of me and leave a blood trail on the way back to their little
box in the middle of the screen. 
 
     So what else is new?  Well, Deluxe Pacman is FAST. Imagine the original
pac man on say, the bannana level. That is about how fast this thing runs.
Even on a stock Amiga it is fast. There are lots of little special effects
that add to the over all asthetics of the game and the high score table
music is good. 
 
     Why did I only give it a 3?  Welp, I am glad I asked that.  See, it is
neat, new, and revolutionary but in the end, it is still just Pac Man. Sure
the AGA graphics are nice, but it is still Pac Man.  So, I guess if you were
one of those yellow pupiled people I spoke of earlier that did nothing in
the 80's but cash your paycheck and put it in the Pac Man machines, then
this is YOUR game.  But, the lasting power of this game is dramatically
limited.  You are better off getting this author's game DELUXE GALAGA which
will keep you entertained FAR longer than the yellow circle.

        Damn it.  I hate reviews like this, but it is a public responsi-
bility to do this sort of thing.

        As you can see from the info box, life isn't good with this proggy.
I love Arkanoid type games and I had high hopes on this one.

        First problem, the files must not have been archived with the
'maintain directory structure' flag on since I had to physically create two
directories myself after unarchiving it (this is cont- rary to what the docs
said).  Naturally I had to engage SNOOPDOS to locate what directory these
files went in.  Bummer.  Off to a bad start.

        Next, after I FINALLY got SNOOPDOS to be content with the directory
structure and I got no FAILed loads, the music kicked in and the screen went
black and BOOM;  the Guru Commeth.

        Figuring that it was just my touchy A4000/040, I tried every type of
degrader and such to get this to work.  No good.

        Then, I went ahead and tried it on my CD32/SX1 A1200 clone with 020
processor and it still crashed.  So, after about 30 minutes, I gave up
trying to review this program.

        Sad thing to, and I hate to do this kind of negative review.  I WILL
say though, that if the authors read this and care to send me a copy that is
functional, I will be happy to re-review it in a future issue. Until then,
this game isn't even worth your DL time I am afraid to say.

                        THE RETURN OF THE CLASSICS 
 
     I can't being to tell you how much I wanted to review TFX for you this
issue, but I haven't been able to get OCEAN to cough up a copy yet, so I
decided to offer you readers another valuable service.  (NOTE: A call to
OCEAN confirmed that despite everything TFX is *NOT* out yet, and it may not
be....Sigh)
 
     Everyone remembers the classics.  The games we played in the old arcade
or at home on our beloved 8-bit machines like the C64, Speccy, Apple, or
Atari machines.  Many of us still love the time worn treasures that got us
hooked into gaming all those years ago.  Although games have progressed so
much farther than even the classic movie WARGAMES predicted, some of us like
nothing more than to sit back and play a blast from the past. In fact, many
companies are getting back to the basics like Broderbund with their LODE
RUNNER DELUXE and EA with ARCHON ULTRA.  With such games as TFX and SHADOW
FIGHTERS ruling the headlines, it is often hard -if not impossible- to find
the classic games of old. 
 
     As usual, ALG comes through with the ultimate list.  Here is a list of
all those old classics and their Amiga equivelents.  We will talk about them
a bit after the chart.  These are as close to the original games as I could
find.  NOTE:  Titles listed as PD HOUSE can often be found on on-line
services like the Internet, GEnie, Compuserve, etc.  MAIL ORDER includes
'new' companies as well as the 'used software' companies. BARE BONES in the
U.S. is said to be a good source.

Enter DUX as the password and you will be taken right to the game of 
  CARNIVAL!  Go figure.  Must've been one of the coders' favorite games.  

** DELUXE GALAGA is not a perfect clone, but the game play is so similar 
   and gripping, that it was my first choice.  There are other more 
   perfect 'clones', but none as fun. 

*** My personal favorite clone was ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE II.  Same type game
    but LOADS of blood and stuff.  Heh heh heh. 
 
     The list could go on and on.  But, that is enough for now.  If you are
looking for a classic from the 8-Bit world or the arcade realm, why not
submit it to the READER'S REACTIONS column and we will include them here.
Maybe some of the readers can find them for you.  Here are some of MY
personal favorites that I haven't found yet.  Anyone got 'em? 
 
                ARCADE                       8-BIT LAND 
              ZOO KEEPER                  FORBIDDEN FOREST 
              TOP GUNNER               LEGACY OF THE ANCIENTS 
           STAR TREK (VECTOR)                ALTER EGO 
             DISCS OF TRON                     SUNDOG 
             CRAZY CLIMBER                 FORT APOCALYPSE 
 
 
     Anyway, some of these classics will REALLY take you back.  Many of the
ones listed have 'extra' goodies as well as the 'basic' elements.  For
example, FOOTMAN is not only a perfect pac man clone, but it also includes a
cool two player SIMULTANEOUS mode where you BOTH eat dots together. Brings a
whole new element to the game.  MINE RUNNER has a cool four player mode
where four players can play together.  Tough, since only ONE man gets to get
away.  Bummer - everyone else dies. Hee Hee.  VEKTOR STORM has some of the
coolest music around, and DELUXE GALAGA will make you ONE with your
joystick. 
 
     In a past issue of DUP DISPATCH, I talked about getting back to the
basics.  Now that we have helped you get back to the basics, let's hope next
month I will get some software companies to send me over some good stuff to
review (hint hint - C'mon OCEAN, I am DYING to play TFX!) and bring us back
to the future.

                              @{b}@{fg shine}CD32 SPINDOCTOR@{ub}@{fg text}
 
                       SPINDOCTOR'S FAST RAM KILLER 
 
     I promised you all good CD32 support and here I am!  The doctor is in
and I am gonna hook you guys all up this month by showing you a neat
hardware hack for your SX-1 box!  For those of you without the luxury, you
might want to skip this part and continue down where you see the three
asterisks in the middle of the screen! 
 
     So, why a FAST RAM KILLER?  Well, there seems to be a LOT of games that
just plain don't like Fast RAM, since the CD32 comes without any I guess. In
any event, it is a pain in the bum to go to the shell, run a NOFASTRAM
utility, then EXECUTE CD0:S/STARTUP-SEQUENCE, etc etc etc. Wouldn't it be
nice just to flip a switch to do it then hit reset?  Or just turn it on
without the FastRAM?  You bet.  Makes games like CHAOS ENGINE and MICROCOSM
work without a hitch. 
 
     First, the disclaimer.  Amiga Link, Amiga Link Games, Dark Unicorn
Productions, nor the CD32 SPINDOCTOR is responsible for any damage done to
you machine by this modification or caused BY this modification.  Proceed at
your own risk. 
 
     What you will need: 
                         One Single Pull, Single Throw Switch  
                         One standard jumper (NON-JUMPED!) 
                         Two 10 inch pieces of wire (thin stuff) 
                         Solder gun and solder 
 
     Now, it is easy.   Just solder the two wires to the switches' leads and
then solder the other end to each of the leads of the jumper.  Now, you can
run the switch through that convienent hole in the back above the disable
switch, or you can even mount it there with a bit of ingenuity. Finally, you
have to put the jumper somewhere.  Take off the cover of the SX-1 and look
in the middle.  You will see a row of jumpers.  Attach the jumper across the
pins of jumper #3.  Now, when the switch is in one position (crossing the
pins, basically) Fast Ram is disabled.  Flip it and reset it, you have fast
ram back.  It is that simple!  Long live the CD32! (If you have any
questions or problems, contact Shane Monroe via mail.  No phone calls!
Please!) 
                                    *** 
 
     Now that we have that little project out of the way, let's get back to
some interesting stuff. 
      
     Before we get to the reviews this month, I will fill you in a bit on
the current CD32 situation.  For those of you who have been on a deserted
island the last year, Commodore liquidated their assets and ESCOM of Germany
ended up with the Amiga pie.  Instead of repeating old news, do yourself a
favor and pickup May's DUP DISPATCH and read all about it. Suffice to say
that there will be many thousands of CD32s available through Christmas 1995
so you can expect support to continue for your machine. AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES
(the subdivision of ESCOM that is handling the Amiga/CD32) are planning to
release a new CD32 in 1st quarter 95 sometime. A new hyped up CD32 (my guess
is built in FMV and texture mapping capabilities) will be released and with
any luck it will be 100% backwards compatible.  In the meantime, CEI in the
U.S. and an unnamed U.K. source will re-introduce the FMV cards soon. Both
will be compatible with the current FMV technologies but (I strongly
suspect) it will comply with the new FMV standards which will allow 144
minutes of video per CD. Yippee. This is gonna be COOL!  Huh huh. 
 
     Many companies continue to support the CD32 including Time Warner which
brought us Rise of the Robots (uh...huh huh...uh).  Time Warner will be
bringing us PRIMAL RAGE in September.  Yum Yum I can't wait.  For those of
you interested more in what is coming for the CD32, I covered that subject
in great depth in past issues of DISPATCH (yeah, yeah, yeah, you are tired
of hearing that - but that is what you get for jumping on the wagon late!
:). 
 
     A few tidbits to pass along also.  I aquired many CD32 titles recently,
and wanted to share a couple of little things with you that didn't really
warrant a full review ... 
 
     ... DENNIS from OCEAN isn't as bad as I thought it would be. Actually,
a pretty damn fun little platformer.  Movie tie in was gay (IMHO), but the
movie itself was gay so there you have it.  No reason not to check out the
game though. 
 
     ... BUBBLES AND SQUEAK is cool.  Addictive too.  Damn, when am I gonna
find time to frequent the Internet and get this damn magazine done? 
 
     ... Having never actually SEEN the ASSASSIN'S GAME CD, I was totally
impressed.  It is fully CD32 booting (no floppy drive or memory or crap
needed - although some games require the keyboard or mouse). It was 90 %
PAL, but what the hell?  You are all using 1084s anyway right?  I guess I
could play a different game every day for 5 years and still have some games
to go... Cool.  Some of the stuff is a bit dated, but for the price, you
can't beat the game-to-price ratio here. 
 
     ... Wanna kill another full weekend?  If you have a floppy drive
attached to that CD32, get the 17BIT PHASE IV collection. Sheeze, the
Suicide Man animations ALONE are worth the CD's price. 
 
     ... Eric Schwartz fans rejoice.  The MEETING PEARLS CD has everyone one
of his animations that I know of .. And many I didn't.  This will require
the SX-1 since you have to access it from Workbench. 
 
     ... JUNGLE STRIKE is an odd title.  Looks NTSC but forces a PAL bootup.
Hmmm.  Also, it doesn't boot at ALL with the SX-1 plugged in. Odd, eh?  Not
even disabled. 
 
     ... Oh god, if you have an FMV card, you have to get CANNON FODDER CD32
just for the funny as hell 5 minute or so intro FMV movie.  Reminds me of
the Beatles' HARD DAYS NIGHT video.  It is also sort of a collector's item,
since ALL other versions of CF (3D0, Jag, PC, etc) do NOT have that movie -
instead they have a lame raytraced intro.  I reckon it has something to do
with the sheep in stockings in the FMV video :) 
 
     ... SUBWAR 2050 runs great from an unexpanded CD32. Cool. 
 
     ... Stuck on SIMON THE SORCERER?  Check out the FULL SOLVE in the GAMER
GEMS area this month! 
 
     ... There is a cheat for MICROCOSM there too. :)

     Fighting games rule.  That much is obvious enough by the amount of cash
games like PRIMAL RAGE, KILLER INSTINCT, the STREET FIGHTER series, the
MORTAL KOMBAT series, and the VIRTUAL FIGHTER games are raking in at the
arcade.  The home console market, in addition to that, is multi-billions
yearly.  So it should come as no surprise when I tell you of yet another
great fighting game for the CD32. 
 
     Fighting games on the CD32 itself have been limited.  There have been a
few, such as INTERNATIONAL KARATE+, ULTIMATE BODY BLOWS (great game), and
RISE OF THE ROBOTS (oh PLEASE!  KILL IT, KILL IT!) but the hot games like
STREET FIGHTER and MK/MKII have missed the Amiga console in favor of their
computer brethern  (MKII on the Amiga, by the way, is just great considering
it will run on ANY Amiga including ECS).  ULTIMATE BODY BLOWS had quite a
few moves using all the buttons on the controller a couple of times, but it
really didn't capture the feeling of the classic fighting games. As much as
we game players bitch and moan about having to enter moves like DOWN,
FORWARD, BACK, BACK, HIGH KICK (what move is this?  Anyone? Anyone?) we sure
seem to get pissed when a game doesn't have it.  
 
     SHADOW FIGHTERS CD32 is probably the best of the bunch.  It is
DEFINATELY without a doubt the best fighting game on the CD32, and (although
I haven't seen the AGA version of it) it is probably the best one on the
Amiga side too.  But I don't want to get ahead of myself. 
 
     First things first.  LOTS of characters.  As in 17+ of them.  With MORE
coming.  That even gives all the players from UBB a run for the money. The
characters are all very diverified (although some are looking slightly
familiar - as in STREET FIGHTERish).  You fight in different countries
(alright, enough with the SLIGHTLY part;  VERY STREET FIGHTERish) and do the
classic 'best out of three rounds' bit. 
 
     If were to stop right there, this would be nothing more than a simple
UBB clone.  BUT, let me tempt you more.  Now, each character is controlled
using just ONE BUTTON (built-in Amiga compatibilithy eh?) which is nice for
people who get confused with a six-button GENESIS controller, let alone the
7 on the CD32 controller.  Here is the kicker that got my attention.  Each
player has AT LEAST (mostly more, mind you) 25 moves  Those of you with
calculating minds have already come up with 16 moves with one button.  Yup,
that is where the MK approach comes to play.  Moves are executed with
combinations followed with the button or in conjuction with the button. Some
moves are ground based, while others are done in the air.  Getting better? 
 
     Next, let's throw in something near and dear to my heart.  The BLOOD ON
option.  Now it is not NEARLY as grisly as MK (blood jutting everywhere) but
it is a nice touch to see the blood streaked on the floor, ain't it? The
biggest problem with the game is the lack of FATALITIES.  That was what made
MK into the most played fighting game of all time and it is here to stay.
N.A.P.S. should've known this and figured it into the equation. Alas, no
FINISH HIM here. 
 
     Going downhill again?  Okay, time to bring you back up. The backgrounds
are not static (this was the #1 complaint in MKII for the Amiga - the arcade
backrounds were chillingly animated) but very much so animated and even have
the cool parallax effect found in games like KILLER INSTINCT where closer
objects move slightly faster side to side than objects far away.  For those
unfamiliar with parallax, go get in your car and start driving.  Look out
the window at the clouds.  They are going by pretty slow, eh?  Now look at
the mountains, then the trees, then the roadside, then finally at the road
(don't plaster that old man with a walker who is crossing the street at the
wrong time and place - the insurance company will never believe the "I
didn't even see the old man until he flew across my windshield" line).
Notice the 'reality' that the different 'scrolling' speed makes?  That is
what is incorporated into Shadow Fighters.  It is also well illustrated in
the KID CHAOS CD32 background also.  The ULTIMATE parallax I have seen is in
Arcane's T-RACER.  God, that is cool.  Be enough of that.  Trust me, when
you see the subway drive past and the action doesn't slow down, you will
love it. 
 
     The graphics are pretty decent, but nothing to go call the PCers over
to see.  On the other hand, the animation of players is all pretty good, and
the accompaning sound effects are very good.  The most important thing of
all is that it plays smooth.  Players respond fast enough (although figuring
out the 90% of the moves the book DOESN'T tell you about really bites) when
you finally figure out all the moves and how to do them properly on the pad.
Might be a good idea to plug in the old Amiga stick for this game since you
don't need the other buttons anyway. 
 
     The thing that grabbed me the most was the TRAINING mode.  Different!
Have you ever seen those cloth, stuffed mannequins at a tailor shop?  The
ones they pin the fabric to as they cut it out and stuff?  Basically they
are a big round stuffed torso and a big round stuffed head.  Throw on a
Frosty the Snowman face and you have it.  Oh, and it has no legs:  just a
long pole with a round ball at the end (how the hell does it stand up?).
That is who you fight for the training matches.  Before you go and start
laughing and looking for a seam ripper to take care of business, beware! He
is a FORMIDABLE foe!  Last count shows he has MORE special moves than anyone
else.  REALLY special moves (it is like a Monty Python movie) like throwing
bowling balls at you, his head opening up and a long arm with a giant hammer
in its hand sliding out and banging you on the head, his stomach opening up
and a huge circular saw blade jutting out of it, and such goodies.  He will
DEFINTELY keep you on your toes.  I thought it was cool.  Kudos, N.A.P.S. 
 
     I gave it a 5 because I keep playing the damn thing.  A game can have
crappy graphics and sound, but if I keep coming back to it, it is worth my
hard earned cash.  Those of you looking for KILLER INSTINCT or MKIII better
go look somewhere else.  On the other hand, if you want a highly playable
game with tons of stay power combined with a slick aethetically pleasing
interface, you ought to give Shadow Fighters a shot.

     What can I say?  After playing the one level COW CAR preview that was
floating around, I couldn't wait to get my paws on the real thing. Now that
I have it, I am a bit dissapointed while at the same time I have something
new to suck up time I don't have. 
 
 
     SS is a driving game.  Nothing more;  nothing less.  There is no
weaponry like in ROADKILL, nor is there car enhancement like ALL-TERRAIN
RACING.   There are no vermin in the road to run over, nor can you actually
destroy your car or your enemies.  It is racing.  Pure and simple.  But,
simplicity isn't all bad.  You don't have to worry about watching the damage
meter or rolling over that flying cash.  It gives you more time to
concentrate on the main goal.  Winning the race. 
 
     Don't get me wrong.  There are some REAL high points to SS too.  For
those with a blood lust (like me) this game might leave you initially cold.
BUT, after sticking around awhile I found some cool stuff. 
 
     First, there are lots of raytraced cars to pick from.  While they are
smooth, they are not quite as clean as ATR, but there are several types to
choose from including the famous COW car. (What a riot; a cow with wheels
for feet - I about crapped myself laughing as they flew around the track).

 
     Fortunately, there are many tracks;  some of them are just downright
ugly with ugly turns and loop arounds.  For that, it is a good thing the
game won't let you go the wrong way (although that take some of the fun out
of it).  Some have long jumps (ala Stunt Cat Racer, eh?) too, while others
seem to be made for sheer speed. 
 
     You read right.  Up to eight players can play.  Pretty neat eh?
Although I wouldn't expect too much speed with that many people.  With just
two people the game is playable.  With three, ummmm.....  But, you can put
as many computer controlled cars (up to 8) and not worry about the speed
problem.  Now this is playing alone, NOT with the modem option going.... 
 
     MODEM!???  YES!  Finally, a cool game you can play over the modem. No,
not NULL modem.  REAL modem.  Heh heh heh.  Unfortunately, I don't know
another person who has the game, and I haven't been able to get it to run
from the A4000/CD properly yet to check this function.  Sucks, but I think
it is all there and will be super cool once we get it going.  Anyone want to
give it a go?  I am game (but YOU foot the bill! :). 
 
     The game has a couple of niceties like being able to pull a caravan or
another car behind you while you drive (makes a great 'weapon' to keep your
enemy from passing you around the curves).  There is also an option to set
the laps and the direction of travel. 
 
     The bottom of the truth is that it is just a racing game.  Lap after
lap.  Although the modem play might make it a totally different game, right
now I only give it a 3.  I will be happy to revise the score if I love the
modem option as much as I think I will.  Until then, I recommend you TRY
before you buy if possible, or if this kind of racing is your bag then grab
the checkered flag and get it!

     When I was overseas (from the U.S. mind you) in Scotland, I had my
first exposure to slot machines (or 'fruit machines' as they are called
abroad) and I must admit I spent an ungodly amount of money losing to them.
I am pretty sure the draw was that I might just get that BAR BAR BAR the
NEXT pull.  Er, or maybe the NEXT one...Or the next....Damn!  :)  In any
event, there have been some good fruit machines out there, but the idea that
I get to see naked pictures of women while I played I figured might be
enough of a draw instead of the money.  SEXPOT wasn't anything like I
expected.  At all. 
 
     The game is your standard fruit machine with various types of fruit
spinning past the three windows. Instead of certain combinations earning you
more credits to play, they earned you move points.  When you got some
points, the whole machine scrolled off and a game board popped up. Your
little peg would then move on the board the appropriate blocks and you would
be awarded the box value or bonus you landed on.  Some were worth credits to
keep playing, and some were skulls to send you back to the beginning of the
board.  On the other hand, there where some with little cameras on it.  The
bigger the camera, the more revealing the subsequently displayed picture
would be.  They do bare all, by the way, and there are 30 models
(advertised) through the game.  I suck at fruit machines, so I have only
seen two of them. :(  The machine does have some of the basic fruit machine
stuff like HI-LO and BUMP, but that is about it. 
 
     The graphics are tolerable and the sound is just barely so.  But, there
is something funny about the game.  You keep playing it.  For no real reason
(not even to see the 'breasts and bumms' hahahah) you just keep playing.  I
guess that is the mark of a decent game, right?  I chose the value of three
because, well, there isn't much to the game (explains the short review) and
the box says that the PC version has digitized VIDEO of the women (that
disappointed me....HELLO!?  Haven't you heard of CDXL format???!!!).  Bottom
line is that it isn't much, but it is still fun. 
 
     Is the price worth it?  Weeeeeeell.... I guess if you are starved for
adult games (I recommend the PD game XPOKER personally) this isn't that bad.
If you like fruit machines with a different twist, give this a try. I
personally wouldn't part with more than a tenner for it in any case. Seems
to play alright in NTSC though, and that is important, too. 
 
     Hell, I dunno!  I had a good time playing it.  Maybe you will too.

        NOTE: After playing this game for about five more hours, I decided
that it has some redeeming qualities.  Mainly mega-addictability.  I would
jump the price up to a $20 bill now, after pulling my hair out playing it
over and over again.  It could've been better, but it is definately worth a
close look.

                           @{fg shine}complete solve@{fg text}

(An old game but someone wanted to finish the cool CD32 Version)

  This solve is intended for someone who's stuck at some point in the game,
not for someone who just wants to play it all through with no effort. If you
haven't been exploring the game on your own you'll have no idea where the
places are that I'm telling you to go to.
  First, go to the troll bridge. The troll won't let you by because he's on
strike. In one of the forest scenes there's a barbarian with a thorn stuck
in his foot. Find him, talk to him, and Simon will pull the thorn out. The
barbarian will give you a whistle for you to blow when you need him. Go back
to the bridge and talk to the troll. He'll take the whistle from you and
blow it. The barbarian will appear and beat the troll up. The bridge is now
open.
  Beyond the bridge is an oaf. Talk to him. He needs water for his magic
beans. Go to the witch's cottage. There is a handle on the well. Use it an
the bucket will rise to the top. Get the bucket and go back to the oaf.
You'll pour the water on the beans and leave the screen. Turn around and go
back. The oaf is gone but some of the beans are still there. Get them and go
to the back of Calypso's cottage. Use the beans with the compost. A
watermelon will grow.
  Get the watermelon and go to the screen with the bard. Use the watermelon
with the sousaphone. It will jam and you'll talk the bard into giving it to
you. Go to the sleeping giant and use the sousaphone. The way to the upper
mountains is now open.
  Go to the tower. The bell won't ring because it has no clapper. Go to the
forge. The clapper is on the table. Get it, return to the tower, and use it
with the bell. Now use the bell and hair will drop down from the top of the
tower. Use the hair to climb up into the tower. You'll end up with a pig
called Repulser.
  Take Repulser to the "candy house" (the house with the beehive next to it)
and use her on the door. Now you can get inside. Get the smokebox and hat.
Go to the pub. There's a box of matches on top of the fruit machine. Get it
and return to the candy house. Use the smokebox on the beehive.
  There's some wax on the beehive. Pick it up. Go back to the pub. Talk to
the barkeep and ask him to mix you a drink. While he's making the drink, use
the wax on the beer barrel behind him. Wait around. He'll throw out the beer
barrel and give you a voucher. Leave the pub and pick up the barrel.
  Go to Calypso's cottage. Open the drawer. Take the scissors that are
inside and return to the pub. Use the scissors on the dwarf. You now have a
beard. Go to the screen that the dwarf mine is on and wear the beard. There
is a rock lying on the ground next to the mine. Pick it up and look at it.
Enter the mine. When you're asked for the password, you can say "beer"
immediately because you looked at the rock.
  Inside the dwarf mine, try to go left. You'll be stopped by the guard.
Give him the beer barrel as a bribe. He'll go to drink it and leave the path
to the mining operation open. Unfortunately, the door leading from the
mining operation to the treasure room is locked.
  Go to the Wise Owl's tree. Notice that the Owl drops a feather when he
first talks to you. Get the feather and return to the dwarf mine. Go to the
right. Use the feather on the dwarf who's sleeping on the ground. He'll roll
aside, revealing a key. Get the key and use it to open the treasure room
door. Give the treasure room dwarf the beer voucher. He'll reward you with a
gem.
  Go to the dodgy geezer and talk to him. Offer him the gem. He'll buy it
for 20 gold pieces.
  Go to the dragon's cave. The dragon has a cold. Go to the druid's house
(it's the house with the wagon wheel in front of it). There is a cold remedy
on the stump to the right of the stairs. Get it and go back to the dragon.
Use the remedy on the dragon and it will put him to sleep.
  Go to the mining operation in the dwarf cave. There is a hook with a rope
attached to it hanging next to the door to the treasure room. Get it. Go to
the forge. There is a rope lying on the ground to the left of the barrel.
Pick it up. Go inside Calypso's cottage. Pick up the magnet that's on the
fridge.
  Return to the dragon's cave. Use the hook on the boulder hanging above the
entrance. This will let you climb above the cave. Use the rope with the
magnet. Then use the rope and magnet with the hole. Keep doing this until
the hoard runs dry.
  Go to the woodman and talk to him. He needs an axe made of milrith to cut
through the enchanted trees in the area. He'll give you a milrith detector.
Go to the screen in the mountains with the small statue and use the milrith
detector.
  The screen above the dragon's cave has a rock lying on the ground. Pick it
up. It has a fossil inside. Take it to Von Jones's dig and give it to the
hole. Von Jones will tell you to get the fossil out. Go to the forge and use
the rock with the anvil. The blacksmith will break the rock open and reveal
the fossil. Go back to Von Jones's dig and give the fossil to the hole. Tell
Von Jones that you marked where you found it with your metal detector.
  Go to the screen that you left your metal detector on. Look at the dirt
around Von Jones's hole and you'll see milrith ore. Pick it up and go back
to the woodcutter. He'll tell you that he needs it made into an axe head. Go
to the forge and use the milrith ore with the anvil. The blacksmith will
pound it into an axe head. Take the axe head back to the woodcutter. He'll
go out to chop down trees, leaving the door of his house open.
  Go to the dragon's cave. There's a fire extinguisher inside. Get it and
return to the woodcutter's house. Go inside and use the fire extinguisher on
the fireplace. Now move the hook that's in the fireplace and you'll be
transported down to a secret room. There is mahogany on a shelf to the left.
Pick it up and take it to the woodworms' stump. Tell them you have it and
they'll jump into your hat.
  Go to the room at the top of the tower. Use the woodworm on the
floorboards. This will let you get to the ground floor of the tower. There's
a wedge holding the door shut. Pick it up and open the door.
  Go to the druid's house. There's a ladder leaning against the wall
outside. Pick it up, take it back to the tower, and use it with the hole in
the floor. Go down the ladder and open up the tomb. You'll be scared away,
but come back and open it up again. There is a loose bandage on the mummy.
Try to take it and the mummy will fall apart. Pick up the staff it drops.
  Go to the back room of the pub. Give the staff to the wizards. Then give
gold coins to them to pay the membership fee. You're now an official
wizard.
  Go to the druid's house. There is a specimin jar on the left side of the
upper level. Take it. Go to the Swampling's house. Use the stew with the
specimin jar. The Swampling will then tell you he's run out of stew and go
to get the ingredients for more.
  Go to the screen containing the bridge over the gorge. In the lower left
hand corner of the screen are some vines. Go to them and you'll climb down
into the gorge automatically. Talk to Gollum. He tells you that he's fishing
for food. Tell him that you have genuine swamp stew for him. He'll give you
the fishing pole in return. You'll automatically use it to fish the One Ring
out of the river.
  Go to the goblins' fortress. There is a paper under a rock below and to
the right of the door. Get the paper and take it to the storekeeper. Go to
the front of the store, leave the screen, and then come back again. There
should be a box there now. Open the box and you'll be taken to the goblins'
fortress.
  Open the box to get out of it. Pick up the rat bone that's lying on the
floor. Look at the boxes and you'll see your spell box. Pick it up and look
at it. You'll find a piece of paper inside. Use the paper on the door, then
use the rat bone on the lock. Pick the paper up again and you'll have the
key. Use the key on the lock and open the door. Go to the right. You're in
the main cell block. Get the bucket and go down.
  Talk to the druid. He thinks you're a demon because he can't see you.
Remove the ring and talk to him again. He tells you that he turns into a
frog when he sees a full moon. Use the bucket on the druid. Now pick up the
flaming brand that's in the brazier and use it on the druid. He'll turn into
a frog. The commotion has attracted the attention of the goblins so hide by
opening the iron maiden and walking into it.
  Days later, the frog will return. Open the iron maiden, then walk over to
the frog and take the hacksaw that's in his mouth. Use the hacksaw on the
bars and you'll be free.
  There is a gnarled old tree high up in the mountains. Talk to it. It wants
you to remove the pink splodge on it. Go to the shop. There is a bottle of
white spirit to the left of the storekeeper's heads. Buy it, take it back to
the tree and use it on the splodge. Talk to the tree again and you'll be
told four magic words.
  Go to the witch's cottage. She first appears when you try to pick up the
broom. If you already tried to pick it up she'll appear the moment you walk
in the door. You must now fight a wizard's duel. This is actually
rock-scissors-paper played with transformations. Keep going back into the
cottage and playing until you win. You'll get the broom, but the witch will
cheat and turn into a dragon. Use the magic word that turns you into a mouse
to escape.
  Go to the druid's house and talk to him. He tells you that he has a potion
for you, but needs a herb called frogsbane to help him with his lycanthropy.
Go to the Swampling's house. There is a chest on the floor below the chair.
Move it and then open the trapdoor that is revealed. Go down the ladder. You
can't go to the right because there's a loose plank. Go to the shop and buy
a hammer (it's hanging on the wall to the left of the shopkeeper's heads).
Return to the Swampling's house, go down, and use the hammer on the plank.
Now you can go to the right and get to Skull Island. On top of the skull is
the frogsbane. Get it and go back to the druid's house. The druid will give
you the potion.
  Go to the row of climbing pins in the mountains. Unfortunately, there's
one missing. Go to the woodcutter's house. There is a pin on the table
inside the house. Get it and return to the row of pins. Use your climbing
pin on the hole and you'll be able to climb across the mountain.
  The snowman on the other end won't let you pass. Go back to the torture
room in the goblins' fortress. On the floor between the doors and bars is a
roll of mints. Get them and return to the snowman. Consume the mints and the
snowman will be melted.
  Beyond the snowman is Sordid's tower. The bridge will collapse as you get
close to the door. Use the broom and it will take you across the gap to the
door. Consume the druid's potion. You'll shrink and automatically walk
through a crack in the door.
  Chippy will take you to Sordid's garden. Pick up the maple leaf lying on
the ground. Walk to the bucket and you'll automatically pick up a
matchstick. There is a stone lying on the ground near the left edge of the
screen. Pick it up and go to the left.
  Try to pick up the lily leaf and you'll pull it to the shore. Use the
matchstick with the lily leaf. Use the maple left with the matchstick. This
boat can't get you to the other end of the puddle, though, because the water
isn't deep enough. Use the hair you got from Chippy on the tap.
Unfortunately, it's caked with rust. Get the seeds that are near the left
edge of the screen (you'll take the boat over there automatically). Use the
stone on the seeds and they'll be pulped into oil. Use the oil on the tap.
Now move the hair and some water will flow out of the tap. Now you can sail
your boat all the way across the puddle.
  On the other side of the puddle is a frog that will try to eat you if you
get too close. Look at the water just below the fisherman's feet. There is a
tadpole swimming in it. Pick it up. Talk to the frog and threaten to hurt
the tadpole. The frog will leave. Now you can pick up and consume the
mushrooms that the frog was sitting on. You'll be returned to your regular
size.
  Open the door and walk into the tower's entry level. The chest there is
actually a monster, and you'll be forced to retreat from it. The tree in the
garden has a branch you can take. Do so, go back into the tower, and use the
branch on the chest. It will be rendered harmless.
  Go to the laboratory at the top of the tower. The teleporter there could
get you out of the tower, but the demons won't tell you how to work it
unless you can send them back to the pit. Sordid's spell book is in the
bookcase with the monster skull on it. Get it and look at it. You find that
in order to send the demons home you must have eight candles, a mouse, a
human skull, and know the true names of the demons.
  The demons won't just tell you their true names - you're going to have to
be sneaky. Go to Sordid's bedroom. If you look at the mirror there, it will
tell you that it can see out of any reflective surface anywhere in the
world. There is a shield in the entry level. Get it and take it to the
laboratory. The center table has a hook on it. Use the shield with the hook.
The shield is pretty tarnished, though. There are some chemicals on the
table. Pick them up and use them on the shield. Now it will shine brightly.
Go to the bedroom, talk to the mirror, and ask to see the demons. You'll
learn their true names.
  Pick up the pouch and the sock. Use the pouch with the sock. Now use the
pouch with the hole at the base of the stairs. You've just caught a mouse.
  Go to the entry level. There is a spear hanging in a rack of weapons. Pick
it up. Go to the torture room. There is a human skull hanging from the top
of the screen. Use the spear on the skull and it will fall to the floor.
Pick the skull up.
  Pick up the chest. Move the lever. This will raise a stone block and
expose the top of another block. Use the chest with the exposed block. Move
the lever to drop the block and crush the chest. Move it again to raise the
block. Pick up the candles that were in the chest.
  Go to the laboratory, talk to the demons, and tell them that everything's
ready. They'll tell you how to operate the teleporter and you'll send them
back to the pit.
  Go to the bedroom. Get the magic wand that's lying on the table below the
mirror. Pick up the book lying on the bed and look at it. It will tell you
that a wand can only be destroyed by being dropped into the Fiery Pits of
Rondor. Go back up to the laboratory, enter the teleporter, and say that you
want to go to the Fiery Pits of Rondor.
  The attendant at the pits won't let you past because you don't have enough
money to buy a ticket. He'll give you some free brochures, though. Look at
the brochures and you'll find an elastic band. On the floor near the fire
bell is a sapling and a pebble. Pick them both up. Use the sapling with the
elastic band to create a crude catapult. Use the catapult with the fire bell
and you'll set it off. The attendant will run away, leaving the way clear
for you to enter the pits.
  Go two screens to the right and you'll see Sordid. The fire system put out
the fire in the pit and he's trying to relight it. Use the wand on him and
he'll be turned to stone.
  The wand must be destroyed in order to free Calypso and the other heroes
from its curse. Go back to the souvenir booth. There is a box of souvenir
matches on the right side of the counter. Pick them up and return to the
pit. Use the matches with the pit and the fire will be relit. Use the wand
with the lava and it will be destroyed.
  One small problem...Sordid has come back to life as well! He'll try to
kill you by wrecking the bridge and teleporting you to the empty space where
it used to be. You're a little hardier than he expected, though. There's a
bucket of floor wax on your side of the screen. Pick it up and go back to
the right. Once he starts casting his spell you'll have a few seconds to use
the floor wax on him. Sordid will fall into the lava and be killed. You are
a winner!

                @{b}@{fg shine}GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT AMIGA LINK GAMES@{ub}@{fg text}

        @{i}AMIGA LINK GAMES@{ui} was brought forth from the well-received disk
magazine the@{i} DARK UNICORN DISPATCH@{ui}.  It was decided that it would be better
to join forces with @{i}AMIGA LINK@{ui} and pull the games out of that periodical and
add them to the DUP's already superior reviews to fashion the best gaming
magazine around.  In turn, all of @{i}DISPATCH's@{ui} productivity and such went to
AMIGA LINK instead.

        As of now, the primary author/editor of this magazine is Shane R.
Monroe, founder of @{fg shine}DUP@{fg text} and the @{i}DISPATCH@{ui}.  As time goes on, there will be
more authors to allow a more varied opinion here.  Feel free to submit a
resume and sample copy to me and I will get back to you on it.  I could use
some more talent here! :)

        The magazine is dedicated completely to the entertainment aspect of
the Amiga.  No articles about the Emplant or the Cyberstorm or anything like
that.  Just pure fun.

        Interested in subscribing to this or AMIGA LINK magazine?  Just send
your Email address to ZOOL@CYBERSPACE.COM and he will hook you up.

        Thanks for taking the time to read our magazine! :)

        Welcome to our monthly trivia contest to test your knowledge on
Amiga games and entertainment.  Since this is the first month, let me
explain how this all works.

identification, sound sample identification, music clips, miscellaneous
questions about games past and present, and all sorts of other stuff.

        How do you win?  Answer all five questions.  Send them to:

                        Goose Creek, SC  29445

        All entries with all five questions answered directly will be put in
a hat and chosen at random.  Winners will be notified by E*Mail or Snail
