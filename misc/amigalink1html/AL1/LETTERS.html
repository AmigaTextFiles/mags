<PRE>     As you can see, no one has actually written to us yet, but that's only
to be expected; nobody has read Amiga Link yet!  =)  We at Amiga Link want
all of your feedback, suggestions, and responses to the magazine, so that we
can make it as good as possible!  (Note:  if you include a FTP site for
dirty gifs at the end of the letter, your chances that the letter will be
published and read are greatly improved!  =) )
     If you don't want your letter to be published in the magazine, please
say so in your letter.   
     Mail all letters to: jgalun@maple.nis.net with the topic: Letters to
the Ed.   You can also mail them to Joshua Galun@1:107/590.0 (Fidonet), Zool
on The Wolf's Lair BBS (201) 666-9472, or DCC them to Zool on IRC on the
#amiga channel.
