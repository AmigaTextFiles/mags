                                <b>Theme Park</b>
                          From BullFrog Software
 
    Sim City lovers, this is a MUST-HAVE game!  The game is very fun, and 
 takes a lot of time to play.  The object of the game is to build a theme
 park.  The game has many options such as adding guards, chickens 
 (Chickens? -Josh) to entertain the visitors, and much more!  You can build
 many rides such as a roller coaster, ghost house, merry go round and more,
 you can even build shops that sell ice cream, french fries, and other 
 items.  This game will keep you busy for a very long time, in fact, this 
 is pure addiction: once you play you can't stop!

                             <b>A-10 Tank Killer</b>
  
    Very nice plane game, the flight panels are identical to a plane.  Five
 on the PC's.  I recommend you have at least 2 meg RAM to play it well.
 All through you can adjust the screen to reduce its size, which will make
 the game go faster.  You are basically in a plane with another person, who
 controls something else.  The game is fun, with detailed bridges, tanks 
 and planes.  This makes a very good game.  The sound is pretty good, but 
 while flying the shooting noise is annoying.

                               <b>Wing Commander</b>
  
    Another plane game, (if you forget that this one is a more like a plane
 in space -Josh) but this one is really good, I love the music and
 graphics, this game gets the Editors Choice!  The game is very fun, the 
 missions are good enough to keep you coming back for more.
