<PRE>     Coming April 1 in issue 2 of Amiga Link: 
     
 o   Fears reviews
 o   Continuation of the paint and coder's tutorials
 o   Two new graphics tutorials
 o   Review of the game Reunion
 o   An article on the complete Amiga solution
 o   The revelation of the Amiga Link CHICKEN SEAL OF QUALITY!
 
    Ofcourse, there will be many many more articles beyond that, including a
review of Dungeon Master II, most likely, and maybe even an article on the
end of the C= Commodore buyout...
