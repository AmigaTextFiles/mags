<PRE>    In using our Amigas and making Amiga Link, we have come across 
 some products and services that we believe exemplary.  They are:    
 
 Amiga Report:  This is a wonderful disk magazine, which partly inspired 
 the making of Amiga Link.  It has many good articles on the Amiga, 
 inluding hardware reviews, and if there is any news on the Amiga, it's 
 editor, Jason Compton, will know it!
 
 Heddley:  This is a program to make Amiga Guide documents (such as the one
 you are reading write now), and it is incredible!  Not only is it very 
 easy to use, but it also quarters the time it takes to make an Amiga 
 Guide doc and has many great features!  It's so good that we use Heddley 
 here at Amiga Link!  You can find Heddley on Aminet.  The author is Edd 
 Dumbill.
