  Happy holidays, I hope that you are sitting comfortably and in a warm
  place reading this issue of WhatIFF? First off I must apologise for
  the lateness of this issue, due to some maintenance work on our home I
  have not had access to my Amiga and then afterwards going to Okinawa for
  a few days (Ahem). We have some fantastic contributions and interviews 
  this issue with @{"Steve Lord" link stevelord} back with an indepth
  guide about viewing YouTube videos on your AGA Amigas. @{"Ivan Sorensen" link ivansorensen}
  has written about the Amiga in 2022, we have interviews with PixelVixen
  and Anthony of The Amiga Show. @{"John Scolieri" link johnscolieri} has a
  review on a Dell LED monitor that is compatible with the standard Amiga
  resolutions.

  This is also our first year as a magazine, it is incredible how the time
  has flown by. I have greatly enjoyed working on the magazine and seeing
  how it has grown over the last year with new writers and content. I have
  new respect for the writers of Amiga Future and Amiga Addict, I have 
  found it a tiring but rewarding job, though it has not been nice to my 
  wallet and as such it is considerably thinner since starting the 
  magazine. The Amiga scene has really grown this year with a lot  of new 
  hardware and games being released, alongside some productive 
  applications.

  It is going to be an interesting 2023 and hopefully we will be there with
  you, who knows how long the magazine will be around but there is hope 
  that we might do a limited print run sometime in the future, more on that 
  next year. In the meantime enjoy this issue, make sure you read 
  @{"Kevin Saunders" link kevinsaunders} Invents Corner page for the latest on his 
  projects. 

  Take care, thank you for having joined us for this year and see you in 
  2023.  Before I go I just want to thank everyone who has written for the 
  magazine this year, especially:

  @{"Steve Lord" link stevelord}, @{"Kevin Saunders" link kevinsaunders}, @{"John Scolieri" link johnscolieri}
  and @{"Ivan Sorensen" link ivansorensen} who have all been regular contributors
  putting up kindly with my constant nagging for articles and updates.

  See you all in 2023!

============================================================================

  I guess it can be summed up like this, and this may be contentious but 
  I'm beyond caring: I don't use retro computers to relive the past, I use 
  them now to create new experiences for the now and to create the future. 
  I'm sick of all the "How I remember the day" and "Are you this old?" 
  bullshit everywhere on the internet, I think this is in a big way why I 
  began to slink back from participating in the retro scene as it's way too 
  backwards looking for my liking. I love old games but not because they're 
  old, but because they bring me joy in the present.

  And also, like yeah, the Amiga was a big failure in the end compared to 
  the PC and Mac really (or it would still be a mainstream system) but what 
  a beautiful fuck up it was! Instead of fighting old wars and old 
  arguments (including telling me the Amiga wasn't a fuck up because in 
  1988 it was everywhere or the A500 sold a million) we should just use it 
  now and enjoy it and push it in new ways to create a new future for it. 
  I don't give a shit about whether an Amiga 1200 in 1993 was competitive 
  to a 386SX, that doesn't matter and never really did, but so much of the 
  retro scene is about that kind of stodgy bullshit.

  I'd just rather use the Amiga now amongst everything else because it's 
  rad, I use it to push the creative envelope in 2022 in a mainstream kinda 
  way, not just in demo comps or on retro YouTube channels. If I could one 
  day hook up with someone who was good at music production, create actual 
  animated anime and merge it with Amiga HAM animation, stills etc. it'd be 
  so sick. I can dream big but one day I'd love to be be launching my manga 
  with a visual DJ event incorporating all that. But seeing as I only have 
  10 readers, I have to keep dreaming.

  I think the one way the old stuff is more interesting is that now it's so 
  punk, compared to all that commodified stuff in a Mac or Windows or even 
  Linux. It's like the world is being drained of its imagination as it 
  stares endlessly down the infinite scroll of the matrix. So I like using 
  old stuff in the present to start disrupting consensus, merge analogue 
  and digital and make something new for now and the future. The world 
  could change tomorrow if everyone deleted their social media and told the 
  Silicon Valley god incarnates to fuck off but then if their is one hope 
  for the metaverse is that Zuckerberg gets so sucked into it he never 
  reappears. All those billions to create him a new ass to disappear up! :)

  My only other thing I want to say to other creatives is think how the 
  Amiga can contribute to wider projects, don't think it all has to be 
  performed through the Amiga. Pete Cannon does this so well with his music
  as does Paulee Bow; this isn't to take away from what CTrix and Hoffman 
  do with just the Amiga. Actually on that note, that's what I want to 
  continue seeing more of, not Sysinfo screenshots and the Frontier intro, 
  but generally more Amiga derived creativity, this is what is enticing 
  about the demo scene but that again is system limited. This isn't meant 
  to be a dig at the tinkerers and modders but I'd love to see some of 
  that power used to creative ends not just as stat waggling.

  Anyway, the future isn't in the past, it's always ahead of you, so run 
  to it and don't look back.

  #Modern 15KHz monitor that works with Amiga

  I'm lucky that I have an Amiga 1080 CRT monitor in my man cave that still
  works great but it's still a pain in the you know what to disconnect it 
  from my Amiga 1000 when I need to trouble shoot or test another Amiga so 
  I was very happy when I recetnly stumbled on a used monitor that was for 
  sale at a local electronic store that was adverised as a 'multi-sync' 
  monitor.

  The monitor is a DELL U2412M LED monitor with VGA, DVI, and HDMI 
  connectors. I hooked it up to my Amiga 1200 with an RGB to VGA adapter 
  and VGA cable that I had lying around and was pleasantly surpised when 
  the early start up menu popped up on the screen with no fiddling of 
  settings etc...it just worked.

  In Workbench all my games and applications worked just fine (including 
  Lightwave/ Modeler and render screens) after adjusting my overscan 
  screens to adjust for the 16x10 format. Games run smooth with no 
  artifacts or tearing and colours are bright and crisp. 

  I also tested the following screen modes:

  - DBLPal- ok
  - DBLNTSC- ok
  - Multisync Productivity- ok
  - Super 72- not working
  - Euro36- not working
  - Euro72- not working

  Interlaced modes worked but with a noticeable flicker though so basically 
  unusable without a flicker fixer.

  Overall I'm very happy with this monitor for my Amiga use and it's also 
  nice to use it with my work notebook as well via HDMI cable when I'm 
  working from home.

============================================================================
    @{b}A1200.net - A1200 Translucent Replacement Case Review@{ub} - by @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

  ##Product Name
  A1200.net Replacement Case

  ##Available From
  www.amigastore.eu
  www.amigaonthelake.com
  www.retrokit.com.au
  www.micromiga.com
  www.retropassion.co.uk
  www.amiga-shop.net (Alinea)
  www.vesalia.de
  www.amedia-computer.com
  
  ##Price
  USD 120 / EUR 99 / GBP 105 (Inc. 20% VAT)

  ##Hardware/Software Requirements
  A1200
 
  ##A New Home For Your Amiga
  
  Over the years my A1200 has gradually been upgraded in one form or 
  another through, CAPS having been replaced, an Indivision AGA MK3, 
  TF1260, GOTEK drive and replacement LEDs installed.
 
  All of the changes have been internal and through this the case has been 
  opened and closed numerous times, as such it has become a bit rough 
  around the edges with the bottom half featuring a crack and all the tabs 
  at the back broken. It still looks white but the wear and tear from 
  constantly being opened and closed have taken it's toll, as such I 
  decided it was time to re-house the venerable Amiga into something 
  more fetching. 

  There were two options available to me, find an original case or buy one 
  of the new ones created by A1200.net. After a search on eBay it became 
  quickly clear that buying an A1200.net was the cheaper option.

  If you have not heard of the A1200.net cases, it was a Kickstarter that
  begun in 2016, after a successful initial fund the cases became available 
  to the general public.

  ##More Than Just A Case

  The cases however go beyond the standard A1200 housing, some of the 
  features of these newer casings are as follows:

  * Made by injection molding
  * Enhanced rear door
  * Vents on the bottom trap door
  * Rubber feet
  * Set of brass screws
  * CF Slot above the PCMCIA slot for HD access
  * Pre-cut GOTEK LED panel
  * Two USB slots on the right
  * Available in different colours
  * UV Protection to stop the dreaded yellowing
  * Metal brass inserts to stop dimples and screw holes breaking  
  
  As you can see these cases offer more than the traditional case and it is
  particulary useful for the modern Amiga 1200 user since quite a few if 
  not the majortiy of users have upgraded their machines with a variety of
  modern enhancements.

  Originally the cases were only available from A1200.net luckily for us
  they can be bought from a number of Amiga vendors. For my case I went 
  with Alinea, however they are also available from the following Amiga
  vendors:

  * www.amigastore.eu
  * www.amigaonthelake.com
  * www.retrokit.com.au
  * www.micromiga.com
  * www.retropassion.co.uk
  * www.amiga-shop.net (Alinea)
  * www.vesalia.de
  * www.amedia-computer.com

  Being in Japan I had to choose a vendor that gave me a better rate for
  my yen to whatever currency I bought the case for. In the end I chose
  Alinea since they had the best price and cheapest shipping option, plus
  they were the only vendor to still have the translucent casing that I 
  was after. After a quick process of setting up an account and making a
  payment via PayPal all I had to do was sit back and wait. Credit must
  given to Alinea for their fast processing, the day after my order had 
  been put in, it had already been packed and shipped. Taking only around a 
  week to arrive I had to quickly prepare my A1200 for it's new home.

  A week later and Japan Post delivered the slim box, luckily I did not
  have to pay any import charges. The box itself comes in a charming and
  nostalgic A1200 box, it is very reminiscent of the original A1200 box all
  Amiga 1200s used to come in. After opening the box I was presented with 
  the case in a plastic bag, and two other bags containing the screws and
  3 x back plates and trap door. Initial impressions were good, it felt
  nice with a textured feel that at least seems to be missing from my 
  original A1200 case. The plastic seemed a little more flexible than the
  my A1200 case but at the same time stronger, it was easy to see where the 
  case can be easily cut for the extra USB ports, GOTEK and CF slot. So 
  enough admiring of the new case, onto the installation ...

  ##Moving Time

  Removing the Amiga motherboard was a simple task of taking off the top
  lid, unscrewing 3 screws to motherboard (at least in my case) and then 
  sliding it out. It was rather alarming seeing how much dust and dirt had
  managed to get into the housing. Sliding the A1200 motherboard into the
  new case was a simple task without any hitches. Once the board was 
  screwed in it was time to attach the Indivision AGA MK3 board, the case
  comes with several back door flaps for those who have a VGA or DVI cable
  coming out the back. However this was my first disappointment with the
  case, the VGA/HDMI adapter of the Indivision screws into a hole on the
  original A1200 case allowing the adapter to sit nice and snuggly however
  the A1200.net case rear door panel is not oriented correctly for the 
  Indivision ports which means if you want to use it with the new case you
  will have to find another way to secure the video port. In my case I used
  some double sided tape but I felt it was a bit of let down since one of
  the reasons for buying the case was the have the Indivision snuggly 
  installed. Hopefully this is something that can be updated in future
  versions. After installation of the Indivision I was able to close the up
  the Amiga. It was here that I really appreciated the new screw inserts
  also the rear now has three other long screws to close the case instead 
  of the weaker tabs. It was nice to be able to screw the Amiga tightly 
  without having to worry about the plastic breaking or dimples appearing.

  ##How Does She Look?   

  As this is more of a cosmetic upgrade for the Amiga you are most 
  interested in how it looks. Well, I was very pleased with how my Amiga
  looks now. The translucent/skeleton/see through case looks fantastic, 
  even with my original keyboard which I had whitened last year the overall
  effect is very pleasing to the eye. You can just about see the chips on
  the motherboard but it gets even more fun when you turn on the Amiga and
  the hard disk, floppy and power lights come on, they help luminate the
  inside of the Amiga enchanced by the translucent case.

  I really enjoy pulling my Amiga out from my desk to see it in it's new
  case, the photos online do not give it justice to how good the Amiga 
  looks in a translucent case. There was one other issue after putting the
  Amiga together however. The PCMCIA slot seems to be 1-2 mmm offset which
  means when inserting a card you are unable to slot it in straight. To 
  make it go in you need to come at an angle and slowly jiggle it in. I had
  double checked my installation of the A1200 motherboard after this but 
  could see no issue with the installation, most likely this is a 
  manufacturing error. Over time it seems like the motherboard has settled 
  into the case though and it has become easier to insert the card but I 
  still have to make sure I do it at an angle.
  
  ##Final Conclusions

  The A1200.net cases are a great way to give your Amigas a facelift, they
  offer more expansion opportunities and look fantastic. If it was not for
  the VGA/DVI back plate/Indivision connector issue and PCMCIA slot 
  misalignment this would be a perfect product. It is built very well, the
  addition of metal scew inserts, replacement of rear tabs for screws and
  the grilled trapdoor all make it not an essential purchase but one that
  is highly recommended. If you want to change the look of your Amiga or
  your case has become a bit rough around the edges then these cases are
  for you.

  ##Pros and Cons

  + Variety of colours
  + More durable than the original cases
  + Goes beyond a tradition case with different backing plates, grilled
    trap door and metal screw inserts
  + Not too expensive
  - Rear trapdoor and bottom case do not accomodate the Indivision
    correctly
  - PCMCIA slot not aligned properly

@toc reviews
============================================================================
	    	  @{b}RNO Effects_68K Review@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

  ##Product Name
  RNOEffects_68K

  ##Available From
  www.aminet.net
  
  ##Price
  Free

  ##Hardware/Software Requirements
  Amigs OS 3.0+, minimum 68020 and fast ram
  MUI, TextEditor.mcc, codesets, guigfx, render, and reqtools libs

  ##Image Processing Is Back

  If you were to think of the best image processing software on the Amiga
  most people will probably mention ImageFX or ADPro. Of these two only
  ImageFX has been updated and that was still a few years back, since then
  we have not had any real challenges to the ImageFX dominance. However
  there is a program that has been available for free for a while now and 
  does a lot of what ImageFX can do and all for free.

  RNOEffects is available for classic Amigas, OS4 and Morph OS, for this 
  review I will concentrate on the 68K version as I do not have an OS4 or
  Morph machine to hand. The software has 30 image processing effects which
  include drop shadows, emboss, various colour filters and drawing options
  for various shapes and text. It is also effecient as a batch iage 
  convertor.

  ##Installation

  The installation of RNOEffects is quite involved (for classic systems) 
  and it took me a while to download everything and figure out where each 
  of additional downloads went. Definitely reading the documenation is 
  highly recommended before even trying to load RNOEffects. The extra 
  installs with the links are as follows:

  - MUI 3.8 or later (http://aminet.net/package/util/libs/mui38usr)
  - TextEditor.mcc (http://aminet.net/search?query=mcc+texteditor)
  - codesets.library (http://aminet.net/search?query=codesets)
  - guigfx.library (http://aminet.net/package/dev/misc/guigfxlib)
  - render.library (http://aminet.net/search?query=renderlib), v32 is 
    probably the best for <040 CPUs
  - reqtools.library (http://aminet.net/package/util/libs/ReqToolsLib)

  Once you have downloaded and installed the above items it is just a 
  simple case of copying the drawer over to a location of your choice. Of 
  the extra installs I found TextEditor most difficult to install since you 
  need to find the MUI install drawer, show all files, locate the 'Libs' 
  drawer, then go to the drawer named MUI and copy the mcc files. The other
  libraries had installers making it easier but it just shows how important
  it is to read the documentation, especially with software that is 
  available from Aminet. 

  After a some time spent downloading and installing the libraries and 
  components I was ready to go.

  ##In Use

  There is a slight delay in loading the program but once it is up you are
  presented with a window, containing three main buttons 'O' - open, 
  'P' - previous & 'N' next. It was a little confusing at first as I have
  imagined 'P' - print and 'N' - new. There are arrow buttons on the right
  which will be greyed out until you have applied an effect as these act
  as undo and redo. 
  
  Overall it is very a sparse and utilitarian window that opens up on your 
  Workbench. As such whatever image is displayed will be limited to the 
  Workbench screen depth. Most of the effects are accessed via the drop 
  down menu. From here you have access to various filters/processing 
  effects that along with saving formats. You can save files in: PNG, JPEG, 
  GIF, ILBM, and BMP along with all Amiga icon formats. The list of effects 
  that can be applied are as follows:

   * Background Colour		* Modulate		* Shadow	
   * Blur			* Monochrom             * Sharpen
   * Charcoal                   * Oil Paint             * Solarize
   * Contrast                   * Opacity Map           * Swirl
   * Crop                       * Perspective           * Tint
   * Draw                       * Pixelate              * Water Ripple
   * Edge                       * Polar Distort
   * Emboss                     * Quantize
   * Flip                       * Reduce Alpha
   * Gama                       * Resize
   * Invert                     * Rotate

  As you can see there are quite a number of effects that can be applied, 
  and each effect has it's own parameters window. It can take some time
  to apply an effect and there is no progress indicator/bar common in most
  modern Amiga software. As such it can appear as if your Amiga has stopped 
  working or the effect has not been applied. Due to being on the Workbench 
  screen it was a little hard to gauge the effectiveness of the applied 
  filter. This was evident when I applied a 'Charcoal' filter and during 
  the application of the filter I was given no indicatiton that the program 
  was working.

  There are lot of options for each of the effects and it pays off to have
  proper look at each of the effects.

  It would be nice to have the effects sorted into different categories, 
  having them lumped all together makes it a little harder trying to find 
  a specific filter.

  ##Overall Impressions

  RNOEffect is a good image effects processor that has some advanced 
  features, and is very impressive for a free product. There is not much 
  that you can't do with it but you do need to spend some time figuring out 
  how to use/apply the effects properly. There is video on YouTube to help 
  you get the hang of RNOEffects: 

  https://youtu.be/KsRtDHXkEKA 
  
  There are just a few issues that stop it from being a really great 
  product. It is quite a journey from downloading the software to getting 
  it up and running, there are a lot of libraries and components that need 
  to be installed and you might run into some problems initially. It seems
  that if you are running OS4.1 or Morph OS the installation however is a 
  much simpler affair. 
  
  One bug that I did encounter was when opening a file in an unrecognised
  format, RNOEffects will suddenly close without any warning. Hopefully 
  this will be addressed in a future update.

  It feels like a program that was made for more powerful computers, as 
  such it is probably a much better experience on an OS4 or Morph OS 
  machine. As it stands running it on a classic machines feels a bit 
  slugglish, and I found myself going back to ImageFX 2 since it is more 
  responsive and is able to handle a larger variety of file formatse. 
  
  ##Final Thoughts
  
  RNOEffects is a great idea hampered by a time consuming installation,
  difficult user interface and lack of resolution/screen modes. If you 
  have an Amiga with a video card or a newer OS such as an OS4/MorphOS then 
  RNOEeffects will be come an essential tool. It's batch processing and 
  large variety of effects make it a valuable graphics utility. However 
  with older software like ImageFX easily available and more suited to the 
  classic hardware I feel less inclined to recommend this to classic users 
  and more to Amiga owners with 24Bit displays or the newer OS systems. 
 
  Download it and have a play around but I recommend having lots of ram, a 
  fast processor and if possible a graphics card.

  ##Pros and Cons

  + New FREE image processor
  + Large variety of effects
  + Batch processing
  - Very slow on 68K Amigas 
  - Really needs a 24Bit display
  - UI could be better

============================================================================

  Welcome to the Aminet Tasters section, here we dip into the latest 
  uploads of interest. We do not have time to cover everything uploaded, so
  this is just a random selection of uploads that caught our interest. This 
  month there have been some standard updates and useful tools for users of 
  older Commodore computers.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

  ##D-CAPS Stomper
  www.aminet.net/package/mus/edit/D-CAPS-Stomper

  A great little program for creating your own kick drums, opens up onto
  to your Workbench allowing you to tweak until your are content with the
  your custom kickdrum. Unfortunately there is no way to preview the audio
  on the Amiga. I contacted the author and at the moment there are no
  plans to fix this. The only way to hear your custom kickdrum is to load
  it into a DAW.

  ##AmiSSL 5.5
  www.aminet.net/package/util/libs/AmiSSL-5.5-OS3

  Another update to the ever useful AmiSSL now on version 5.5, this version
  brings full compatability with OpenSSL 3.0, important security related
  fixes, a built in HTTP(S) client and comes with the latest encryption
  ciphers. If you surf the net with your Amiga then updating to this the
  latest version should be no brainer.

  ##GeoWrite Import
  www.aminet.net/package/util/conv/gwimport

  For those who wish to transfer their GeoWrite documents to their Amiga,
  this utility will convert a GeoWrite file into an ASCII file to be
  read on an Amiga. Reqtools.libary is needed to run the utility. It is
  a useful utility that runs easily, a good program to have sitting on
  your HD if you still use GeoWrite. 
  
  ##WebP Image Datatype V45.4
  www.aminet.net/package/util/dtype/WarpWebPdt

  Update to the WebP Image datatype, this version fixes crashes on 020 and
  030 computers. Gives you more control over how images will be displayed
  on your browser, can turn off dithering for 16Bit+ displays, handles
  both lossless and lossy WebP images.

  ##Icon Libary V46.4
  www.aminet.net/package/util/libs/IconLib_46.4
 
  Latest version of the free optomized icon replacement library, this 
  update fixes a problem with the patch SetMan and a workaround for
  another issue. Good for Amiga OS 3.0-3.9, however I had some issues
  with Kickstart 3.2 and ClassicWB. 

  ##IMP v3.382
  www.aminet.net/package/mus/play/imp3

  Juen keeps improving and updating his fantastic MOD streamer for all
  Amiga models.  With this version it can be used with an IMPBox. If
  you still have not downloaded this incredible piece of software do
  it now!

  ##Hippo Player Update v2.55
  www.aminet.net/package/mus/play/hippoplayerupdate

  One of my favourite audio players, nice and compact with great features.
  With the latest update you get the ability to drag'and'drop folders and 
  all of the fonts can be changed in the main window. The feature that I
  find most interesting is the ability to search and download from some
  module websites.
  
  ##Versatile Amiga Test Program
  www.aminet.net/uti/misc/VATestprogram.zip

  Another Amiga test program for our Amigas, this one is from Jochem 
  Caspers and is a nice little program for finding out what is wrong with
  your Amiga. This update allows for more indepth Bob testing and can
  identify your model of Vampire V2 under ChipID.

  # Watching YouTube Videos On Your Amiga Pt 1: AGA Users

  The Amiga Show is a beautiful YouTube series. A labour of love all about 
  the Amiga, produced entirely on the Amiga. It'd be great to be able to 
  watch the show on the Amiga, and using some Open Source tools, you can. 
  This article focuses on AGAConv and AGABlaster on AGA Amigas - The A1200, 
  A4000, and with a nod to the CD32. A future article will look at options 
  for OCS and ECS Amigas, while a 3rd part will look at other tools and 
  codecs.

  ## No MPEG, No Problem!

  Probably the most well-known 90s video codec is MPEG-1, as used in the 
  old Video CD format. Other codecs such as QuikPak and Sorenson were also 
  popular with Mac users. You might not know that among the many 
  innovations Commodore threw away, CDXL was one of the first full-motion 
  video file formats. The now-expired patent 
  (available at https://www.freepatentsonline.com/5293606.html) 
  demonstrates how CDXL works, tightly coupled to the Amiga's chipset and 
  DMA capabilities.

  As with many Amiga technologies, CDXL gave way to newer formats and 
  software. Markus Schordan started playing with HAM video and eventually 
  created AGAConv and AGABlaster, which are far and away the best ways to 
  watch video on classic Amigas.

  As well as AGABlaster, AmiTube - available at 
  https://blog.alb42.de/programs/amitube/ is a GUI tool for downloading and 
  playing YouTube videos from your Amiga. AmiTube is great for short clips, 
  but requires substantial server resources for transcoding. I wouldn't use 
  it for anything long like The Amiga Show. I'll cover AmiTube (including 
  setting up your own transcode server) in a later issue.

  To download and transcode The Amiga Show, you will need:

  * A Linux machine, or a Windows machine running WSL (Windows Subsystem 
  for Linux)
  * FFMpeg (usually available as a package on Linux)
  * AGAConv - https://mschordan.github.io/amiga/agaconv.html
  * AGABlaster - https://mschordan.github.io/amiga/agablaster.html
  * YT-DLP - https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
  * Access to YouTube to download The Amiga Show - 
  https://www.youtube.com/@theamigashow9506

  ## Getting The Video

  Available at https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp this tool is a swiss-army 
  knife for downloading streamable content. Not only YouTube is supported. 
  Yt-dlp can download from most video sites, sometimes with a bit of 
  finagling. Yt-dlp also supports tools like Sponsorblock, which removes 
  sponsor segments and ads. It also has support for geo-verification 
  bypasses and subtitles.

  You can install yt-dlp from binaries, pip or via your system. I'm using a 
  Linux-based system for getting and converting the video, but many of 
  these steps will work with no more than minor changes on a Mac or Windows 
  machine. I'm testing Episode 8 of The Amiga Show, available here: 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWI-s_lHtjs

  YouTube supplies videos in different formats and resolutions. We'll test 
  AGABlaster in 320x240 resolution lores video. We'll download a 640x480 
  version with yt-dlp. Although it's possible to download 320x240 from 
  YouTube, compression artefacts on lower-resolution YouTube videos are far 
  more apparent. The command to download the 640x480 version of this video 
  in h264 with an mp4a audio track is:

  ```
  yt-dlp -f "bv*[height=480][vcodec~='^((he|a)vc|h26[45])']+ba[ext=m4a]" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWI-s_lHtjs -o TAS08.mp4
  ```

  The cryptic -f value tells yt-dlp to download the best video with a 
  vertical resolution of 480p, a h264 or h265 video codec, along with the 
  best quality m4a audio stream. With a bit more work we can tell yt-dlp to 
  download the entire channel, which will come in helpful later:

  ```
  yt-dlp -f "bv*[height=480][vcodec~='^((he|a)vc|h26[45])']+ba[ext=m4a]" --download-archive tasvids.txt https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2a5umZHO7lyt8pcPcbdnQ -o '%(channel)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s' --restrict-filenames
  ```

  This uses the same format trick as before but downloads the channel's 
  videos to a directory named after the channel, using the title as the 
  filename. A list of downloaded videos is kept in the file tasvids.txt 
  stopping yt-dlp from downloading the same video twice when next run. A 
  script could run nightly to check for new episodes and download them 
  ready for processing and transfer. So far, so good. But how can we watch 
  the results on an A1200? We'll need to convert the video to CDXL format 
  with AGAConv.

  ## AGAConv

  Markus Schordan's AGAConv runs mainly under Linux, but Windows users can 
  use the Microsoft Ubuntu App to run AGAConv. The documentation at 
  https://mschordan.github.io/amiga/agaconv.html details how to download 
  and install the software.

  Once you have agaconv set up in the same directory as your downloaded 
  video, you're ready to start converting. There are a lot of options, and 
  a lot of choices depend on your setup. If you've ever played games like 
  Alien Breed 3D II and have switched between window sizes, pixel sizes and 
  floor and ceilings to optimize gameplay, this will feel familiar.

  The three main factors governing playback are:

  1. Transfer speed (disk bandwidth).
  2. File size and available space.
  3. Hardware configuration (CPU power, bus speed and chipset)

  Of the above, transfer speed is the most important. You're just not going 
  to transfer 640x480 Ham8 at 25 frames per second across a single-speed 
  CD-ROM, Zip disk or Zorro II SCSI Interface to a spinning disk. On the 
  one hand, my Amiga 4000 with FastATA and an 060 can comfortably play 
  320x240 Ham8 at 30 fps in stereo all day long. My CDTV barely manages 12 
  fps at 160x120off the CD-ROM drive.

  CDXL was designed for the CDTV, with a 68000 CPU. Latency and bandwidth 
  are more important than CPU power. Even my CDTV can decode CDXL at around 
  160x120 and a reasonable (for the time) frame rate. Storage and bandwidth 
  will dominate resolution, frame rate, colour depth and audio 
  configurations.

  The good news is that an AGA Amiga with reasonably fast storage can 
  deliver better than VCD quality in many cases. If your drive bandwidth is 
  slow, try reducing frame rate., resolution and switching to mono. 
  Unfortunately I don't have a CD32 to test with, but I suspect that 
  320x240 at around 10fps may be possible from CD. If you have a CD32 and 
  are happy to play around, send your results to the editor and we'll 
  include them in a future issue.

  Another point on bandwidth before we move on. If you're a A1200 owner 
  with fast ram and a stock 020, expect around 20FPS for 320x180 with 
  22050hz mono on internal IDE with a fast Compact Flash card. If you have 
  an 030/50 you should expect better results, especially if your turbo card 
  has a fast IDE interface.

  I cut a short 10 second clip from the episode 8 title screen 
  (3-13 seconds in) to test different AGA conversions. I used 22050hz 
  stereo audio (as the original audio was 44100hz) for my tests, running 
  ham8 and aga8 conversions at 30, 20, and 15 fps with the following 
  results (size in bytes, and filename):

  * AGA8, 30 FPS - 23242K 
  * HAM8, 30 FPS - 23073K
  * AGA8, 20 FPS - 15665K
  * HAM8, 20 FPS - 15552K
  * AGA8, 15 FPS - 11798K
  * HAM8, 15 FPS - 11714K

  The 256 colour AGA8 videos are larger than the HAM8 videos due to HAM 
  effectively acting as a kind of frame compression. The original MP4 video 
  is 126K, but that would never play on a stock Amiga 1200. Playing from 
  RAM disk is also typically faster than hard disk (especially for on-board 
  accelerated RAM), but obviously limits file size. To create a 10 second 
  clip for testing, I used the following command:

  ```
  ffmpeg -i The_Amiga_Show/The_Amiga_Show_Episode_08_-_May_86.mp4 -ss 00:00:03 -to 00:00:13 -c:v copy -c:a copy TAS08testclip.mp4
  ```

  Using a test clip is a great way to test different encoding strategies. 
  Video with little movement works better at lower FPS, while music videos 
  might support higher quality audio at lower resolutions.


  The command line I used to generate the HAM8 video was:

  ```
  ./agaconv "TAS08testclip.mp4" tas08_h8_320_30_s_22050.cdxl --color-mode=ham8 --audio-mode=stereo --frequency=22050 --fps=30 --width=320 --max-fps=30
  ```

  The first argument is the clip generated above. The second file is the 
  filename. As I made *a lot* of test files, I added the colours, 
  horizontal resolution, frames per second, whether it was stereo ("s") or 
  mono ("m"), and the sample rate in hertz to the filename. Most of the 
  remaining arguments are self-explanatory. Frequency refers to audio 
  sample rate, fps is frame-rate in frames per second and width sets the 
  width (as we're resizing a 640x480 video). The max-fps setting specifies 
  a max frame rate. It's not necessary but I added it anyway.

  ## AGABlaster

  Playing back the clips requires AGABlaster, available from 
  http://mschordan.github.io/amiga/agablaster.html - extract the archive 
  and copy the version for your CPU into your C: drawer and you're good to 
  go. Use the following command from the Amiga shell to play a video:

  ```
  agablaster filename.cdxl
  ```

  You should be able to create a file association so that CDXL files are 
  played by AGABlaster when double-clicked. The exact method varies with 
  AmigaOS versions but associations should be documented in your Workbench 
  manual. If you run agablaster from a shell with the keyword "STATS" 
  you'll see a report at the end of the video. This contains information 
  including the actual calculated fps vs encoded fps (in parentheses), 
  audio frame buffer delays (AFB) and video frame buffer delays (VFB). This 
  is helpful to spot where things fail when optimizing videos.

  You can seek forwards and backwards by 10 seconds using the left and 
  right keys. Use up and down to increase or decrease volume, space to 
  pause and M to mute or unmute audio. Backspace restarts the video, while 
  escape or the left mouse button quits agablaster. There's also a cute 
  copper effect that splits the screen into 4 or 16 windows with F2 or F3. 
  Press F1 to return back to a normal screen.

  ## Converting Bigger Videos

  By now you should've understood:

  1. How to download a video from YouTube
  2. How to extract a small clip
  3. How to encode this for playback on an Amiga
  4. How to play it back on an Amiga

  Now you know how to determine practical frame rates, resolutions and 
  expected video sizes (1-2mb per second for 320x240 at frame rates between 
  15 and 30 FPS), it's time to look at a bigger video. Different Amiga OS 
  versions come with different file restrictions. The most common 
  restriction is the 4.3Gb partition limit, closely followed by the 2Gb 
  file limit for some filesystems. Expect to burn through 1Gb every 500 
  seconds at 22050 and 30fps. To work around this, we can split our episode 
  of The Amiga Show and play the segments in agablaster.

  To start with, lets use ffprobe to determine the length of our episode:

  ```
  ffprobe TAS08.mp4
  ```

  In the results I saw the text *Duration: 00:27:32.45*. So that's roughly 
  27 minutes and 33 seconds or 1653 seconds. Using the example above for 
  Ham8 video:

  * HAM8, 30 FPS: 1653 Seconds * 2.3 Mb/Sec = 3801.9Mb
  * HAM8, 20 FPS: 1653 * 1.55 Mb/Sec = 2562.15Mb
  * HAM8, 15 FPS: 1653 * 1.17 Mb/Sec = 1934.01Mb

  We could encode the episode at 15 FPS to fit the entire episode under the 
  Amiga's native 2gb file limit. Another alternative is to use a 
  non-standard filesystem supporting larger files, such as PFS3 or FAT95. 
  An excellent guide to different Amiga filesystems and their limits can be 
  found here: https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=61666

  If you use an editor such as the superb Kdenlive 
  (https://kdenlive.org/en/), you can cut the episode into parts up to 10 
  minute clips. The encoded videos will come in under the native file size 
  limit. When playing in AGABlaster there will be a slight gap between one 
  video ending and starting. It's best to cut at quiet parts, ideally on a 
  solid or black screen.

  If you don't mind the odd potential pause while videos change over, the 
  following command will automagically split the episode into 3 roughly 
  equal sized chunks of 9 minute and 10 seconds.

  ```
  mkdir -p tmp
  ffmpeg -i The_Amiga_Show_Episode_08_-_May_86.mp4 -c copy -map 0 -segment_time 00:09:10.0 -f segment -reset_timestamps 1 tmp/tase08_%03d.mp4
  ```

  The above will create 3 files - tas08_000.mp4, tas08_001.mp4, and 
  tas08_003.mp4 in a tmp/ folder. AGAConv can turn these into separate cdxl 
  files using the following command:

  ```
  for i in tmp/*.mp4; do f=`basename "${i}" .mp4` ; ./agaconv "${i}" "tmp/${f}_h8_30.cdxl" --color-mode=ham8 --audio-mode=stereo --frequency=22050 --fps=30 --width=320 --max-fps=30 ; done
  ```

  Each of the files should come in around 1.3Gb in size. Copy them over to 
  your Amiga and you'll be good to go.

  ## Getting More From AGAConv/AGABlaster

  Use short clips for lower transcode time while testing. This will make 
  optimization so much easier. You can always do a final encode once you're 
  happy with the results. When testing playback under emulation be aware
  that most Amiga emulators don't accurately emulate drive access speeds. 
  Expect significantly higher performance on emulated systems than the real 
  thing.

  Although the fastest transfer rate usually wins, it's worth testing 
  different mediums and filesystems. My A4000 can run full speed, full 
  320x240 video with full stereo 22050hz on my FastATA-powered Compact 
  Flash card. My DVD-ROM drive can still play the same videos at 17 FPS 
  from the A4000's internal IDE interface. If you don't have UDF support 
  via CacheCDFS or AsimCDFS, try  
  http://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/DVD-RAM from Aminet. I get a 
  rock-solid 30 FPS via FAT32-formatted USB drives, but I get constant 
  glitches (possibly due to DMA complexities with my setup). I've also 
  experienced significantly better playback performance with PFS than on 
  FFS. PFS can be found on Aminet at 
  https://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/pfs3aio but this YouTube video might 
  also be useful if you're setting it up on a new drive: 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CytF5LNzpqE

  Audio seems to significantly impact playback quality, especially on less 
  capable systems. If playback is stuttering or sounds like it's time-
  stretching, try using mono or a lower frame rate. Most YouTube video is 
  encoded at 44.1 Khz, so encoding audio at 22050 or 11025 should avoid 
  aliasing effects you might experience at other frequency settings.

  Hopefully by now you should be ready to watch The Amiga Show as it should 
  be seen... on your Amiga! Don't forget, yt-dlp can download way more than 
  just YouTube. The full list of supported sites can be found here: 
  https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md - You can 
  download from BBC iPlayer, Bandcamp, Disney and more! In my next article 
  I'll walk through optimizing video for OCS/ECS systems and playback on 
  1.3 machines like the CDTV.

@node lightwave101 "LightWave 101 - Creating A Starfield"
@toc guides
============================================================================
 	          @{b}LightWave 101 - Part 7@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

  ##Starfield

  As we move into winter and say goodbye to Autumn, the night skies become 
  a feast for the eyes with stars and stellar views. However if you live
  in an area with cloudy skies then you are out out luck, so if you can't
  see the stars above how about making our own star view?

  ##Particles
 
  For this tutorial we are going to be spending most of our time in the
  modeler using particles, or single-point polygons. A characteristic of 
  this polygon is that it will render the same size no matter how far it 
  is from from the camera. 

  With LightWave 3.5 it became possible to choose the rendered screen 
  size of particles and lines:
 
  Small, Medium or Large. 

  Essentially this means a single particle can rendered at one pixel, 
  3x3 pixels or 5x5 pixel arrays. Why this is important you will find out 
  later on.

  With that out of the way, let's get down to the business of making our
  star field. I presume you are in the Modeler, if not, go there now. In
  the modeler select New or press 'N' (the key presses will be capital
  and lowercase sensitive, so (N = shift + N key) and (n = N key) and 
  click on 'OK'. This time we are going to use one of the macros that 
  come with LightWave, click on 'Macro' and find "Point Distributions".
  When the dialogue box pops up enter "10,000" into the 'Number of points'
  box, set 'Falloff Towards' to "Center" and 'Density Distribution' to
  "Constant", you can leave the rest as is. Click on 'OK' to start creating
  your star field, it will take some time depending on your processor.

  ##Naming Your Starfield

  Once LightWave has finished calculating the particles you will see 
  something that looks akin to a cotton ball. This is the beginning of our
  starfield. Next we need to select all the polygon surfaces, the easiest
  way to do this is to go into 'Polygon selection mode' by pressing the
  (spacebar) and rename the surface to 'Stars 1', renaming can be done in 
  the 'Polygon' menu, under the 'Transform' heading. Click on the 'Surface'
  button and type in 'Stars 1' or much easier, press (q). Save this object
  with a name of 'Stars1.10k' i.e. it is our first Stars object and it is
  made up on 10,000 points. 

  Now we need to grow our starfield and this will be done by pressing (c)
  to copy the particles, if you wish to use the mouse the same actions can
  be done with the 'Copy' button at the bottom on of the screen. Next go to
  layer 2, this can be found at the top right of the screen where there are
  20 little square buttons. Currently the button on the far left is 
  selected as indicated by the yellow colour. Click on the box next to it 
  on left and paste the copied starfield by pressing either (v) or clicking
  on 'Paste' at the bottom of the screen. You should see your object now
  duplicated on the screen. If we were to stack the two objects the would
  overlap each other and that would be not be of much help in creating our
  starfield, what we need to do is add some randomness and this is achieved
  via jitter. To do this you can either press (J) or go to the 'Tools' menu
  and select 'Jitter' under the 'Points' heading. Our radius is only 1m so
  we can set the 'Radius' X, Y and Z to '0.1m' which is (5-10 percent of 
  the radius). When finished rename the surface using the key (q) to 
  'Stars2' and save the object out as 'Stars2.10k'. Repeat this process 
  three more times for the first five layers.

  ##The Last Two

  Now that you have created five starfields each one that has been jittered
  and copied to the five first layers we will work on the last two. For our
  sixth field, go to layer six, create a new starfield using the same 
  "Point Distributions" macro but this time enter 5,000 for the particles
  with the same previous settings. Rename the surface to 'Stars 6', and 
  save out the object as 'Stars6.5k'. Finally we can work on our last star
  field, just like before go to layer seven, create another starfield with
  the same macro but this time with 1,000 particles, rename the surface to
  'Stars 7' and save it out as 'Stars7.1k'.
 
  So that is it for this issue, next time we will look at how to bring your
  starfield into the Layout program, set up the camera and render your star
  scene, we might even dip a little into animation. Good luck and have a
  wonderful winter holidays, keep rendering and see you in the February 
  2023 issue!

 	          @{b}Brilliance 101 Part 7@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

  ##Mirror, mirror ... 

  Reflections, a great effect that looks amazing when used in a 3D 
  rendering package but how do we create a convincing and easy effect in
  a 2D paint package. Well Brilliance has you covered here with two tools.
  First off we will be using TrueBrilliace since the larger pallete helps
  in creating a much more realistic effect plus we can bring in other 
  images and there will be no need to remap the colours since you have the
  full 24Bit pallete at your disposal.

  ##Going back

  If you remember in our first tutorial we created a checkered marble 
  texture, if you still have that go grab it and create a brush from it.
  Now we have the marble texture as a brush, let's set the perspective of
  the brush, this time however we are going to set it quite low. Go to the
  'Tweening' menu and click on 'Adjust', now we will adjust the 'XY' Pos
  to near the bottom of the screen. Next adjust the 'X' Rot so you have a
  nice perspective, for my example image I used a value of 79. Once you
  have finished the 'X' Rot move the 'XY' Pos to the lower part of the 
  screen, if possible have the bottom just about disappearing into from
  view. When you are finished, click on 'Use'. Now we can fill in the 
  perspective, if you remember from before use 'Draw Mode' and 
  'Perspective', once you have filled in your screen you should have a
  realistic looking perspective with the impression you are standing.

  ##Clouds, so many clouds ...    
 
  In the last issue we reviewed Clouds AGA, well now is the time to use it.
  Open the Clouds AGA (Or download it if you have not) create a quick image
  of a cloud, it does not have to be too big but if you have the time, an
  image size of 400 x 400 would be suitable.

  Okay, I presume you have rendered your clouds and saved it as an image by
  now. Close Clouds AGA and go back to TrueBrilliance, we currently have 
  our marble floor, for the next part we need to use a buffer screen and 
  this can be done by pressing the 'J' key, it will take you to another
  screen. If you press the space bar you can see , in the 'Buffer' tool bar
  the two spare screens available, it is possible to add more buffers by
  clicking on 'Add' but for the moment we are going to use two, using
  multiple buffers will be for another guide.

  You should have the clouds image now loaded into your buffer screen, so
  cut out as large a brush as possible, then press the 'J' key switch back
  to your working image or the space bar to bring up the buffer toolbar and 
  click on the far left side of the slider to get back to your image. Don't 
  worry if you brush colours look the same, give it a moment for 
  TrueBrilliance to remap the colours. Now we will go back to the 
  'Tweening' menu but for this instance we will be creating the sky all we
  need to do is change the 'XY' Pos to the upper part of the screen, click 
  and drag it to the top of you can use the same values in my example image
  which are 0 and -256, click on 'Use' and then use the perspective tool to
  fill in the top half of the screen. Now you should have a bottom and top
  perspective of a marble floor and blue sky and clouds. If you feel your
  marble floor is a bit dark you can use the 'Brighten' in 'Draw Mode' to
  make the marble a bit brigher, this can be done by simply drawing a white
  filled rectangle over the entire marble floor, making sure 'Draw Mode' is
  activated and 'Brighten' is selected.

  ##Reflecting Our Clouds

  Now it is time to reflect our clouds and to do that we will be using the 
  same cloud brush that we used to make the sky. Also we will go back to 
  the 'Tweening' menu and use the same settings or as near as possible as 
  the marble flooring. Once you have done that we will go to 'Draw Mode'
  menu and choose perspective.  Before you draw anything you need to also
  go to the 'Trasparent' tool and set your transparency level, for my image
  I chose 19% as a good balance between the marble floor and reflection of
  the sky, but you it pays off to have a play around. Instead of using the
  fill bucket this time we are going to use a filled rectangle, draw a
  rectangle covering the entire marble floor. Slowly you will see the image
  crawl down with a transparent and perspective blue sky.

  Hopefully by now you have an image with a reflected sky on the perspective
  marble floor. If you want to add something more you can grab a brush of
  the sky and floor, then choose 'Filled Eclipse', from the 'Draw Mode'
  menu select 'Shape' and you can draw a globe that is reflecting both the
  sky and floor. If you want to reflect the globe on the floor, then I
  recommend using the buffer screen to draw out the shape filled globe,
  grab it as a brush and the flip it with the 'Brush Distort' tool. Before
  pressing down the brush make sure to adjust the 'Transparency' for a more
  realistic reflective effect.

  Well that is the last guide for this year, I hope you have enjoyed the
  our exploration of Brilliance and look forward to continuing the series
  in 2023. Have a wonderful winter holidays and see you in 2023!

  ##Tiny Houses

  We all want to display our Amigas and have easy access to them, however
  for those of us living in smaller domiciles having, our beloved Amigas
  available all the time is not always an option. 
  
  If you have ever lived in Japan, you will know that the available space 
  in apartments and houses can be quite limited. With some of the newer
  houses the floor space has increased but the average person lives in a
  considerably smaller space than those in the United States or Europe. As
  such it is common for family members to share a desk or have the desk in
  a communal area. This can cause some issues for Amiga users, however 
  there is an option for A500, A600 and A1200 users. While only one brand
  of product is used is this guide there are others, the main points to
  take away from this guide are the dimensions.

  ##Sanwa Keyboard Tray

  The keyboard tray was ordered from Amazon Japan, and was delivered by 
  Sanwa Direct, not from the Amazon. It comes in a large and heavy 
  cardboard box. When opened the tray is already put together.
 
  All you need to do is make space on your desk and tighten the bolts. My 
  desk has a thickness of 1.5cm, with the keyboard tray attached this gives 
  me a clearance of 8cm, perfectly fine for an A1200 that sits at 6.5cm.

  The keyboard tray's dimensions are 51cm wide and 29.6cm deep, this fits
  the A1200 perfectly allowing the Amiga to sit comfortably and not hang 
  over the edge. You will not be able to use a mouse though on the tray, it
  will have to be used on your desk which means leaning over every so 
  slightly to reach it. Including the tray height you are looking at a 
  total height of 12.8cm so using a lower chair will make it a more 
  comfortable typing experience.

  ##Availability
  
  As the moment it is only available to Japanese households from Amazon 
  Japan, however as it is being sent directly from Sanwa Direct it is worth
  contacting them about international shipping. Japan Post offers some 
  great rates when items are shipped by Surface mail (3 months average) and
  if you suggest this to Sanwa they will most likely be happy to oblidge
  you.

  When I checked on Amazon.com there is another keyboard tray that looks 
  almost the same, the 'Huanuo Keyboard Tray 27" Large Size', this is 
  easily available in the United States and UK.

  ##Final Thoughts

  While having our Amiga on the desk at all times would be ideal, some of 
  us are not lucky enough to have the space or understanding spouses so we 
  need to keep our Amiga hidden. Having to take out the Amiga and plug in 
  the cables each time you want to use your Amiga is not an ideal 
  situation. The Sanwa keyboard tray is a solid and effective way of 
  stowing away your Amiga when not is use and easy to slide out when you 
  do. It has given me my limited desk space back and looks great when slid
  out. When it is under the desk my wife thankfully forgets its there. 

  If you want to hide your Amiga away but have easy access to it then 
  using a keyboard tray is an effective solution.
  
  While this is just one product there are other keyboard trays available, 
  try to find one that has the following dimensions:

      * 10cm clearance between keyboard tray and the bottom of the desk.
      * At least 51cm wide.
      * At least 29.5cm deep.
      * Total height (including keyboard tray thickness) of 12.8cm.

  If you find one that is easily available in your country then contact us
  so we can add the information to the magazine.

    @{b}The birth of the Amiga-News.de Advent Calendar@{ub} - by: @{"Daniel Reimann" link danielreimann}
============================================================================

  What happens when Corona, the Amiga37 and the anticipation of the Advent 
  season come together? Exactly, the idea for the Amiga-News.de Advent 
  calendar :)
  After two years of successfully fending off Corona, it finally hit me at 
  the end of September. The temptation was obvious to condemn the world 
  and everything. After a short while, however, I decided to make 
  something positive out of it: as bad as I felt, I wanted to use the 
  forced time at home to start planning a virtual Advent calendar.

  As a child, I loved Advent - and in my mid-40s, I still do ;) Obligatory 
  equipment was always an Advent calendar. The Amiga37 was about to open 
  and when I felt the anticipation for this event through our extensive 
  reporting in advance, I thought: why not bring Amiga and Advent calendar 
  together? And since reading out stories has always been part of Advent, 
  the idea was born to create an Amiga Advent calendar with anecdotes from 
  developers, programmers, publishers and creative people and to give them 
  a small stage to introduce themselves at the same time. No sooner said 
  than done: a list of potential candidates was quickly compiled and one 
  mail after the other was sent out.
  I was totally surprised by the positive feedback: actually everyone who 
  thought being able to write a story wanted to take part.

  However, I reached my limits when I tried to find a graphic designer to 
  create the announcement: unfortunately, they were all booked up!
  Making a virtue out of necessity, I now dared to take on this task 
  myself and am satisfied with the result - against the background of my 
  very limited skills: a picture of the local Christmas market (which was 
  under construction at this time) was taken and placed as background 
  picture for a window in AmigaOS 4, drawers were created and the whole 
  thing saved. Using paint.net a headline and the initials of the 
  participants (as a little puzzle) were added. Finished:

  https://www.amiga-news.de/en/news/AN-2022-11-00129-EN.html

  And so our calendar has been running since 1 December and has not only 
  provided us with amusing and beautiful anecdotes, but also awakened many 
  memories. At the same time, the calendar offers a small summary of 
  previous and current projects for the respective patron and thus an 
  appreciation of all those who make an effort for the Amiga. Because 
  without them there would be nothing to report, without them, we would 
  only live in the past. But no, even in the year 2022 software and 
  hardware for the Amiga is being developed. Great.
  
  We hope you enjoy the rest of the stories. It's worthwhile to stop by! 
  And the 24th of December, we promise, will be special...;)

============================================================================
  
  #A Look Back ...
  
  The year is coming to a close and so it is time to reflect. 

  For a system that has not been sold since Amiga Technologies, the Amiga 
  is quite alive these days. It seems that every month brings some piece of 
  new kit to expand your system or make it ever more adaptable to current 
  technology. 

  What is interesting is that it seems no machines are being left behind: 
  For a while it was mainly the 1200 and the big box machines that were 
  getting targeted but we have seen new kit aimed specifically at the 500 
  and 600 as well.

  Retro computing is a bit of an odd market place in that so much is 
  kit-bashed or made to small production runs and the availability of an 
  item in theory is no guarantee that it can actually be purchased when you 
  go to look for it later. While I wholeheartedly believe Amiga does not 
  have to be a multi-thousand dollar hobby, you are often best advised to 
  buy things you really want when they are available, as they will rarely 
  remain so.

  On the software side the focus is usually mostly on games. I have 
  recently embarked on a (probably impossible) quest to play every Amiga 
  game ever released, which meant compiling a list of said games. One thing 
  I noticed is that the number of new Amiga titles have steadily been 
  increasing since 2012/2013 or so and while some new games are mainly tech 
  demos, many are quite awesome original creations as well as ports of 
  classics from other systems.
  
  In fact the wave of new releases was part of why I ended up opting to 
  replace my floppy disk drive with a Gotek, since so many of them are 
  available on ADF.

  Bridging the gap between hardware and software we are also now living in 
  a world where actual Amiga OS updates have been happening and seems to 
  continue to do so. Would anyone have guessed that 10 years ago? 
  I am not on board the 3.2 train yet, since I am pretty in love with my 
  ClassicWB setup but every day the interest increases. Plus I am big on 
  'digital minimalism' lately so going back to basics a little sounds like 
  a good exercise. 

  On a personal level, this was also a good year for Amiga: 
  My system is now set up in the living room and every night I take an hour 
  or so to play a couple games, check out a demo or listen to some mods. I 
  have been looking at ways to spend less time on the internet and the 
  Amiga is a nice way of doing so, especially since there was so much 
  content I never experienced at the time. I think I saw maybe five demos 
  at the time, so being able to access the huge library of demos and watch 
  them now is pretty fun.

  To me collecting is only ever a side hobby (I own 7 game boxes and a few 
  manuals for the Amiga). The purpose of the system is to use it and every 
  purchase I make for it is aimed towards that goal. 

  In conclusion it has been a strong year for the Amiga and I look forward 
  to seeing what crazy, innovative and groundbreaking things people come up 
  with in the new year.

============================================================================
	     @{b}From Across The Pond: US Amiga Magazines@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

  Magazines played a large part in the Amiga's life, we all have memories
  of going to the newsagents/bookstore to see if the latest issue of our
  favourite magazine was out. The UK in particular is well known for 
  having had many Amiga magazines; Amiga Format, CU Amiga, The One, Amiga
  Power, Amiga User International, Amiga Computing, Amiga Shopper, and
  probably more, that alone is seven that I could list off the top of
  my head. The US howver is not recognised as having had many Amiga 
  magazines, the most famous being Amiga World and Amazing Computing 
  Amiga. There were many more though early in the life of the Amiga 
  published in the US. Amigo Times, Amiga Resource, Transactor, Comodore 
  Magazine, Amiga Plus, Ahoy Amiga, AX, Graf/X, Amiga Informer, .info and 
  Amiga Sentry. That takes us up to 13 different magazines, if we add in 
  the magazines dedicated to the VideoToaster such as Video Toaster User,
  and LightWave Pro, it takes us up to 15 magazines! Having lived in the
  UK I would have never imagined there were 15 different Amiga magazines
  of sorts, it just goes to show how the US Amiga market was viewed 
  differently from across the pond.

  That being said, my experience with the Amiga started in the US, we 
  were living in Pennslyvania during the release of the A500 and as 
  luck would have it our family purchased an A500 with Commodore monitor.
  Along with the Amiga I was also introduced to the world of Amiga
  magazines, in our area there were only two Amiga magazines easily 
  available in the bookstore, video game shop or camera/video stores, yes
  it is a bit different than the UK. My goto magazines were Amiga World
  and Amazing Computing Amiga, of the two I preferred Amazing Computing a
  bit more as it concentrated more on the creative uses of the Amiga. That
  does not mean Amiga World did not have enough creative articles, in fact
  far from it, but I preferred the writing style and attitude of Amazing
  Computing. 

  In regards to the differences between the US magazines, I found the size
  to be immmediatly noticable, the UK magazines come in at the typical A4
  size but the US magazine size is a bit shorter. The page count did not
  go much above 100 pages, the UK magazines definitely being thicker and
  bigger. I find that I prefer the former format though more as it is a bit 
  easier to hold and fits easier into a bag.

  Amiga World and Amazing Computing Amiga were both there at the beginning
  of the Amiga's life with Amiga World's and Amazing Computing Amiga's 
  first issues coming out in 1985. Amiga World was published by TechMedia 
  Publishing in New Hampshire, a one year subscription fee was USD 29.97
  and for the rest of the world USD 84.97 Airmail. It was stated at one
  point in the magazine that they had 100,000 subscribers. Amazing 
  Computing Amiga was published by PIM Publications Inc. in Massachusetts, 
  a one year subscription was USD 29.95 and outside the US USD 49.97 via 
  Surface. It is interesting seeing how much cheaper the subscriptions were 
  for the US magazines compared to the UK magazines, although it should be
  noted AW and AC did not come with any cover disks.

  Looking back at an issue of Amiga World it is interesting to see how much
  more text there is verses the bright and visual Amiga Format/CU Amiga.
  The UK magazines seemed to want to assualt your eyes with large full 
  colour images, Amiga World and Amazing Computing were a bit more 
  restrained in their use of imagery. Amazing Computing however did have
  more images and colour than Amiga World, they had a tendancy to use half
  the page for images which AW seemed to avoid.

  When reading Amiga World, it feels very much like a newspaper, there is
  a lot of text, you can go several pages at a time without a photo or
  image. In in a way it makes it feel like a product aimed at the mature 
  reader, the UK magazines at times felt like they were for the teenagers
  who had an attention span of 30 seconds. While there was a little more
  colour and imagery to Amazing Computing it still did not have the large
  photos and images of the UK magazines, again it also felt like a magazine 
  targeting the older audiences. Thinking about it now, the Amiga was 
  largely used as a game machine in the UK so the general use Amiga 
  magazines had to take that into consideration.

  The nature of the articles was another area of difference, if you wanted
  to read game reviews there were just 3-4 pages and contained just a 
  paragraph or two, and maybe one photo for the whole page. Amazing 
  Computing had a little more colour and images but it was also mostly 
  columns of text when it came to game reviews.

  While these two magazines may not have not put in the same effort into
  reviewing games as their cousins across the pond, when it came to doing
  tutorials and reviews you could guarantee on them having some of the best
  articles. In fact most of what I learnt about the Amiga was from AW and
  AC, these magazines were made to support your creative use of the Amiga
  and they were at the top of their game with video production, 3D 
  rendering, music production, graphics techniques to building the most
  powerful Amiga possible. Reading the UK magazines made me think the big
  box Amigas were interesting but it was when reading the US magazines that
  I decided to upgrade to an A3000 with a Picasso II card, their coverage 
  of the bigbox Amigas was far greater, demonstrating how to create a more
  capable Amiga. One other aspect of Amiga World that I liked was the 
  'Your Turn' that would crop up in reviews, these were little boxes that
  had a sort review of the product written by the readers. It was a nice
  way to balance the reviews giving your a broader idea of the product.

  Amazing Computing Amiga delved a bit deeper into tutorials having full
  programming guides, graphics and other tutorials on how to improve the
  look of your Workbench. The magazine tailored to the user who likes to
  tinker around with their Amiga and try to get the most out of the 
  software and hardware. If you needed to find some help on how to do 
  some graphic trick or rendering technique then your best chance would be
  in Amazing Compututing Amiga. Amiga World in a way was the Amiga Format 
  for the US market and Amazing Computing Amiga was the CU Amiga 
  equivalent. Both magazines though came out several years before the UK 
  publications so it should be the otherway round.
 
  When I moved back to the UK I continued a subscription to Amiga World and
  Amazing Computing Amiga. It was always exciting to see the white envelope
  with the US postal stamp come through the mail slot. Even with all the
  choices of UK Amiga magazines available to me in the shops I kept up with
  Amiga World until its last issue in 1994 and Amazing Computing until 1999
  when it too closed. It was a very sad day for me when I received my last
  issue of Amazing Computing Amiga, more than any other Amiga magazines, 
  these two magazines helped shape and direct my Amiga adventures and I 
  often go back to my old issues to read up something I had forgotten about 
  or learn something new.
                         
  If you are new to the Amiga or have been around for a long time and have 
  not read Amiga World or Amazing Computing Amiga, I highly recommend 
  having a look. It is easy to download an issue from the Internet Archive
  sites or if you are willing to spend some cash buy back issues from 
  places such as eBay. There is software and hardware that I have not seen
  reviewed in UK magazines and even some games that seemed to not have been
  written about in British magazines. But it is the tutorials and guides on
  software such as Brilliance, LightWave and ImageFX that make the issues
  still stand out all these years later.

    		@{b}Amiga - The First LD Computer@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

  "The first LD computer?!", you are thinking, "What does he mean?", well
  let me clear some things up first, when I say LD I mean Learning 
  Difficulty. You may know me as the editor of WhatIFF? but unfortunately
  that is not my full time job, though it can feel like it at times. My work 
  is with children who have learning difficulties, more specifically I am a
  dyslexia specialist. I go to schools and learners homes to help children
  who have dyslexia learn how to read and write. It is a job that is in
  some respects as far away from technology as possible since using paper
  and pen is a very important part of the job. The reason I decided to do
  a job like this is because I am also dyslexic, I had a tough time in
  school, my teachers orginally thought I was deaf, that is how severe my
  dyslexia was and still is, just ask my wife! It does not help that I have 
  an auditory processing disablilty on top of that. You are probably now
  thinking, "Hang on, if you have dyslexia, why are you writing a magazine?"
  
  A fair question, firstly I love the Amiga and secondly I enjoy pushing 
  myself and writing is still a hard job for me. But writing about the 
  Amiga makes it a bit easier, the Amiga is akin to taking novocain.
  
  Now that is out of the way, let's get back to the main topic of this
  article, why is the Amiga the first true LD friendly computer? To 
  understand why this is so we need to look at how we help dyslexic 
  learners. For most learning is done via rote (which is repeat many times
  until the student remembers) it is fine for most students, but for this 
  to work you have to be able to read and write without issue in the first
  place.

  If you are unable to read and write properly pretty much all learning in
  the school enviroment becomes very difficult, hence the reason dyslexia
  is considered a learning difficulty. It has been at times viewed as a 
  learning disability but disability means that something is not possible
  i.e. a person without legs can not walk, i.e. they are disabled. A child
  with dyslexia can learn, but they learn in a different way and that is
  why we call dyslexia a learning difficulty.

  When teaching a dyslexic learner we take it slowly, there is a lot of 
  repetition but the informatiton is presented in a variety of ways using 
  auditory, visual and physical techniques. Often moving the body, speaking
  and looking all together help the learner retain the new information. 

  Dyslexic learners respond better when they can see, hear and touch a 
  concept. This is where the Amiga comes in. Being the first home computer 
  that could offer real sound, animation and graphics along with the 
  physical input of the mouse as standard it became the first computer to 
  provide input for all the senses. We had a teacher who did not tire or 
  get angry that you made the same mistake the 20th time. We could hear and 
  see a concept, though the animation and auditory abilities of the Amiga.

  Whats more the Amiga could even read our text back to us, sure it was not 
  perfect but whatever we wrote it would not laugh at our mistakes but just 
  show us where the mistake was. For writing school reports this was a true
  game changer. The Amiga is often remembered as the first real multimedia 
  computer but it was also the first real computer that could give leaners
  with dyslexia an edge that they had never had before.

  I remember with fond memories using the spell checker and having my Amiga
  read me back what I had written. The educational software had sampled 
  sounds and animations and using the mouse gave me better hand and motor 
  control. It was a whole new world of learning that gave me not only the
  confidence to learn more but also to enjoy it. Eventually the Amiga's
  multimedia abilities started to affect my school work as well. For 
  example in music class we had to write a song and play it on an 
  instrument, I already was struggling trying to figure out how to play
  any instrument. So I was told I could use my Amiga, it was this pint that
  I encountered OctaMED and started my journey of tracking. The 4 channels
  and columns were so much easier than reading and writing music notes on 
  paper. It did not end there, already I had been playing around with 
  DPaint and when I brought in my Amiga to show my art teacher, I used the
  HAM mode. She was blown away and asked me to do a series of computer 
  images for class. I am here now because the Amiga could support my multi
  sensory teaching through it's multimedia capabilities.

  Now in my mid 40s I am able to read, write and spell with relative ease
  and enjoy reading greatly. I believe that this is in part thanks to my 
  Amiga for helping me get through school and for being one of my teachers.

  If you are still reading this, thank you for sticking with me on this 
  journey into the Amiga and dyslexia. It is thanks to the forward thinking 
  designers that the Amiga could support LD children in the 80s like no 
  other computer for over 10 years.

@toc talkingamiga
============================================================================
	       @{b}Interview - Anthony (The Amiga Show)@{ub}
============================================================================

  Hello Anthony, thank you for agreeing to take the time to participate in 
  our interview.

  @{b}1. To start with can you tell us a little about yourself and your 
     background?@{ub}

  Hello! I'm Anthony and I've been into video and animation for a long as I 
  can remember. From the age of 6 I wanted to be a TV cameraman! Although 
  that didn't quite happen, my love of cameras remains and I did end up 
  working in Film and TV in Visual Effects, which I still do today.

  @{b}2. How did you get started with computers and the Amiga?@{ub}

  The first computer we had was a ZX Spectrum, which I absolutely loved; 
  played games on it, tried to write games on it (in basic, and not that 
  well). Eventually I saw images of the Amiga and I could not believe what 
  I was seeing, and eventually saved up enough money for an A500 (KS 1.3 
  had just arrived. My friend's machine was bought 2 months prior and came 
  with 1.2). The jump from the Speccy to the Amiga was incredible, I was 
  hooked! The graphics, sound, even the keyboard was such a step up.

  @{b}3. You are the creator of the YouTube video The Amiga Show, can you tell 
  us a little about the show and why you decided to create it?@{ub}

  Going back about 10 years or so, I saw there was a surge of people 
  streaming online. It coincided with my renewed interest in the Amiga, so 
  I had this idea that I could make a Saturday morning type show on the 
  Video Toaster; streaming it live from the Amiga. There could be Cartoons, 
  game reviews, some music, that kind of thing. But I realized that it 
  would take a certain personality type to pull this off and not really for 
  me. But I still thought streaming from the Toaster was a fun idea. 

  At this point I had no Amigas at all (having got rid of them in the mid 
  90's) never mind a Video Toaster. Slowly I started coming back to the 
  Amiga scene, pickup bits and pieces along the way until I had a 
  functional Toaster. By this point, I realised what I wanted to do was 
  document this wonderful machine and community, using the machine itself.

  The Amiga Show was born.

  @{b}4. Your show is quite unique in that you use a Video Toaster, which is 
  rarely seen outside the United States, how difficult was it to obtain one 
  in the UK?@{ub}

  It seemed an impossible dream when the Video Toaster appeared on the 
  front cover of Amiga Format. I had wanted one ever since!

  I ended up scouring eBay and found US sellers that were selling boards. 
  You're right though, running it in the UK can be fraught with difficulty 
  (being an NTSC product) particularly as I'm using an Amiga 2000. This 
  setup requires hardware modification to fit an NTSC oscillator to the 
  motherboard, as the Toaster requires very strict timings to run.

  It's also best to use it with 2mb of chip RAM, so that also need to be 
  sourced. The complication being a I needed to find a compatible Fat 
  Agnus! Oh boy, I'd forgotten these traumas :D.


  @{b}5. Which version of the Video Toaster did you purchase such as 2.0 or 
     Video Toaster 4000 and why?@{ub}

  I actually have both, although currently I'm using a 2.0 board, and 
  keeping the 4000 card as a backup. I would love to run the show from an 
  Amiga 4000 as some point, but that feels like a project for another time. 
  It means I lose some of the 4000 effects, but equally it gives the show 
  a more time appropriate appearance, which is part of the goal; to feel 
  like it's archive of a forgotten show.

  I also use a Flyer card with a bunch of SCSI to SD cards. This turns the 
  toaster into a non-linear editor and is very much the heart of the 
  production.

  @{b}6. What kind of any difficulties did you encounter setting it up, such 
     as PAL to NTSC conversion?@{ub}

  The is a HUGE part of the puzzle. I've struggled with multiple was of 
  doing it, each has benefits and drawbacks. My go-to solution is a Sony 
  1024G standards converter. This is a prosumer cross converter than can 
  take VGA/PAL/NTSC video (composite/s-video/RGB) and convert it to any of 
  those. It's is a real swiss-army knife! The output is a bit soft though; 
  it's a trade-off.

  The other way is to convert the video on a timeline on a Mac or PC, but 
  that can lead to long render times, and I feel it breaks the spirit of 
  the show.


  @{b}7. How did you find learning the software since there are a lot of 
     components to the VT system?@{ub}

  It definitely has complexity to it, but the real joy of the system is the 
  way it works together with each software module. The editor, paint system, 
  Lightwave and the caption generator all work together. It's really very 
  impressive, I'm still only scratching the surface.

  Fortunately, there are some amazing resources out there! YouTube has a 
  great number of companion and instructional VHSs and have been going 
  through those.

  Can I also add huge thanks to amigavideo.net. It has a great archive of 
  training videos for loads of Amiga titles. It's such a great resource, 
  there has never been a better time to dust of a copy of Vista Pro and 
  getting to work!

  @{b}8. Since the VT was not particularly well known outside the States, 
     where were you able to get advice and support from?@{ub}

  EAB has really been a great help. I had been following the on-going 
  trials from another board member and his experiences were invaluable. 
  There was also a dedicated cable that I need to make myself (gulp) but 
  eventually found a diagram and was reasonably straight-forward, even for 
  someone like me!

  @{b}9. Did you ever use the Video Toaster: The Desktop Video Magazine as a 
     resource for your channel? @{ub}

  I really should do, I imagine it's stuffed with tricks and ideas. That is 
  actually a great idea! Thankyou :D

  @{b}10. What has surprised you most about using the VT?@{ub}

  Probably going back to the fact that it's a wonderful eco-system. Without 
  doubt it is the best suite of software on the Amiga, no competition. I 
  also admire the way the opened it up with Arexx to allow it to be 
  transformed and integrated by 3rd party developers. There are some unique 
  programs which I would love to explore.

  @{b}11. How would you improve on the VT?@{ub}

  Hmm. Good question.. I still can't work out if you can rotate a brush in 
  Toaster Paint! Some of the documentation is a bit thin on some of the 
  editing tools, so that could have been better. It's also quite easy for 
  sequences to fall out of sync with the audio, and some effects won't 
  trigger if they're too close to another effect. It can feel like you're 
  problem solving more than editing sometimes, but that is often the 
  creative process anyway.

  @{b}12. What parts of the show are you most proud of and why?@{ub}

  I'm most proud of the response from viewers to be honest. It's not for 
  everyone, but those who watch it really enjoy it. There's definitely a 
  long way to go, I would love to make more shows than I do, but I'm 
  totally committed to the show and I'll just keep chipping away.

  From a personal perspective it's been a huge leap to produce something 
  and present it to people. It's going to sound crazy, but I often get 
  embarrassed just by hearing my name mentioned, so this was a big hurdle 
  to jump.

  @{b}13. What advice do you have for others who wish to use the VT for their 
      own videos such as on YouTube?@{ub}

  Do it! It's a really fun process, that makes you re-learn video 
  production. Forget importing mp4s, this is video flying down a mess of 
  cables! And don't forget about the audio, you need cables for all of 
  that too. It can feel a bit intimidating, but draw a quick sketch of the 
  things you need and how they connect, and jump on eBay :D

  It's also possible to create animations in Lightwave for use on your 
  Mac/PC editing software. The Amiga version of Lightwave can render up to 
  8k! With accelerators and emulation, the Amiga can still be used to 
  create something contemporary and (is a) valid creative tool. Going back 
  to these bits of software from a modern perspective can be a revelation. 

  So have fun.

  @{b}14. How many Amigas and non-Amigas do you have?@{ub}

  Oh dear. Here's the confessional. Too many! I have a 1000, 2000, 500+, 
  1200 and CD32. Yikes! And a 500mini. I also use a Mac and PC to encode 
  the video to YouTube, plus off-loading any expensive renders.  I have 
  no issue with emulation. When it comes to rendering, faster is always 
  better. Then I can ftp the frames back to the toaster.

  @{b}15. What is your favorite model of Amiga and why?@{ub}

  I will always have a soft spot for the 500, it was my first Amiga and I 
  loved using it. Playing games, making animations, digitising pictures, 
  and building sequences in Deluxe Video. Good times! But the 2000 has 
  become such a day-to-day workhorse, I have a huge amount of respect for 
  it.

  @{b}16. Do you have any final words or comments before we finish off?@{ub}

  Thanks for watching!

@toc talkingamiga
============================================================================
	 @{b}Interview - Pixel Vixel, Manga and Amiga and Artist@{ub}
============================================================================

  @{b}1. Vicky thank you for taking part in our interview, to start off can 
  you tell us a little about yourself?@{ub}

  Well, thank you for having me first of all. I'm from the UK but currently 
  live in north eastern Japan and have been here for nearly 3 years. I'm a 
  keen runner, as well as generally really enjoying retro video games 
  albeit mostly on consoles but I do play games on the Amiga from time to 
  time. I also formerly worked as a wedding photographer but more generally 
  photography is a big part of my life too.

  My main pastime aside from artwork these days is skateboarding, I am 
  currently recovering from breaking my wrist 2 weeks ago so can't draw at 
  all right now. But I spend a lot of time skating and I am hoping one day 
  to create photo projects on the Japanese skate scene.

  And finally, I spend most of my time working on my manga Future Saviors, 
  the story of how three misfits in society find their place in the world 
  and deal with their past to create the future.

  @{b}2. You are known for your manga and computer graphics, which one started 
  first the computer graphics or manga?@{ub}

  Technically manga, if we expand that to include western comics, as I drew 
  comics from a young age. None were ever published obviously, it was 
  little kid stuff, but my favorite character was this rad dog called Dawg. 
  How 90s!

  @{b}3. What was your first computer?@{ub}

  A Commodore 64.

  @{b}4. What made you want to do computer graphics?@{ub}

  Curiosity. So, the second C64 came with an art package and as a keen 
  artist I wanted to see what I could do. It turned out nearly nothing as I 
  only had a joystick to control things. When I got the Amiga that changed. 
  I do know for sure at the time I never looked at computer graphics as a 
  replacement for "traditional" artwork, I just saw it as another method 
  like 	do I do this in copic marker or color pencil kind of thing.

  @{b}5. How you introduced to the Amiga?@{ub}

  That, like so many things in my life as I get older is not 100% clear. 
  But I do remember about three things before I got an Amiga. The first 
  is my cousins. They always had the latest stuff, be it clothes, shoes, 
  music, but also games consoles/computers. My family was relatively poor 
  growing up. I don't even know if I had a C64 when I discovered one summer 
  my cousins had an Amiga 500. We only played games but I remember thinking 
  how good it was. I'm fairly certain that was 1992 as I connect that 
  memory with the Barcelona Olympics; but it's possible it was earlier like 
  1990 or 1991. The second memory is simply all the kids in the playground 
  talking about they now had an Amiga for games and how good it was. That 
  was definitely around 1991/92 as well. The third was a family friend, 
  they had an Amiga 500 and I remember vividly playing Buggy Boy, Rainbow 
  Islands and Jumping Jackson on it. So I was generally aware of the Amiga 
  and through the Silica ads in Zzap 64 and Commodore Format I also knew 
  about the Amiga through that.

  @{b}6. What do you enjoy most about creating graphics on the Amiga?@{ub}

  That's a hard one to answer. I think much of it comes down to simplicity 
  and familiarity. For example I really like Aseprite but Deluxe Paint is 
  just so much simpler on basic things, such as mixing a palette. So 
  despite a lack of layers and multiple undo it's just easier but maybe 
  that's due to familiarity. I also love DPaint's extensive animation 
  capability.

  @{b}7. What is the most challenging part of doing pixel work on the Amiga?@{ub}

  Apart from motivating myself to do it, but then we can all procrastinate
  on a real Amiga, the mouse. I'm sorry but most stock Amiga mice from 
  Commodore are awful, bad ergonomics on the tank mouse and both that and 
  the later mouse Commodore released with the 600/1200/4000 are low 
  resolution ball mice that are just hard to work with. That said, the 
  Amiga 3000 pregnant mouse and the later Amiga Technologies era Amiga 
  mouse are passable. I much prefer the optical mice Alfa Data made.

  @{b}8. Which Amiga art package do you use and why?@{ub}

  Deluxe Paint. Again due to familiarity. On my real Amigas, DPaint IV AGA 
  is my weapon of choice, but I will use III and V. III has the best 
  palette requester, V has some very useful animation capabilities such as 
  multiple palettes and camera control. All suffer from one undo level but 
  you soon get used to it.

  @{b}9. Other than your current Amiga art package, what other Amiga graphics 
     software would like to learn that you haven't yet?@{ub}

  Brilliance II. I have it, at least in the UK but I never got to grips 
  with its UI and the animation power isn't as good as DPaint V but I'd 
  still like to learn it better one day.

  @{b}10. What Amiga hardware do you have/use for your artwork?@{ub}

  In the UK I have an Amiga 500, 600 and 1200. I don't have them here in 
  Japan although someone has loaned me an A600 which I shamefully don't use 
  due to having nowhere to set it up. I hope I can if I move in 2023 though.

  @{b}11. Regarding Your manga Future Saviours, do you use your Amiga at any 
      stage of the creative process?@{ub}

  Yes, after I retreated from the Amiga scene in 2020 for various reasons, 
  I have been quietly building some skills. My impression these days is I 
  don't want the Amiga to be the start and end of the creativity, I want to 
  use bits of it in a wider sense e.g. merging DPaint animations into Final 
  Cut movies, using hand drawn assets, and maybe other new stuff. 
  Essentially to create a trailer or music video but use the Amiga's quirks 
  for an aesthetic. It's something I am in no hurry to finish so it may not 
  see the light of day for a few years.

  @{b}12. In previous interviews you have mentioned using the HAM mode as a 
      creative technique, can you elaborate a bit more on that?@{ub}

  Sure. For me, and others will disagree, I'm not bothered about Amigas 
  (not) having 24bit displays and high resolution, for that I have my 
  MacBook. I want to sit down on a 1MB Amiga 500, and use its HAM mode to 
  generate something that has a charm all of its own that only the Amiga 
  has. So creating glitch animations using hand drawn assets and just 
  generally messing about with it until it looks sick is what I like doing 
  these days. I want it to have a punky edge that looks totally like I'm 
  using the wrong tool but also the right tool that makes it genuinely lo 
  fidelity but full of wonder as a result. I am a big believer in 
  imperfection in life, the imperfect is what makes stuff interesting. 
  Likewise I want to sit down with limitations and push them, this is why 
  I still admire stuff like the cut scenes in Ninja Garden on the 
  Famicom/NES, so many limitations but so much style. This is why I kinda 
  champion the Amiga 600 as it's easy to put 2meg of chip in them and then 
  you can really go mad with animations.

  The reason HAM appeals to me is the way it works to display more colors, 
  it creates sometimes ugly color ramps, but any form of color changing 
  over a few pixels instantly gives an image something unusual. It also 
  means with DPaint you can in effect do transparent brushes over a cel, 
  allowing you to really mess with it.

  @{b}13. What did you find most challenging when moving with your Amiga to 
      Japan?@{ub}

  Well, the fact I couldn't take it! I didn't have room. In the end that 
  has worked out fine; because I believe my future exists in me as an 
  artist, not as that Amiga artist. I emulate these days. But I'll never 
  sell my Amigas and I will one day use them again.

  @{b}14. What is your dream Amiga setup?@{ub}

  Just an Amiga 500 or 600. I am patient so the 68000 doesn't bother me but 
  maybe a 68030 will speed up HAM work a bit. All I need in an Amiga is 2MB 
  chip, some mass storage to save files and that's it; as well as a copy of 
  DPaint. Whilst the A1200 gives me all of the flexibility I need from an 
  Amiga, I prefer the A600s small size, but the A500 is a classic.

  Back when the Amiga was my main computer in the late 90s, 68040s and PPCs 
  with RTG made sense, but now I don't really care about it. I was offered 
  a 68060 card for free once, I turned it down for various reasons but it's 
  wasted on me. There is something pure about sitting down at an Amiga 500 
  with DPaint III and messing around. I think CTrix best encapsulated that 
  vibe with his series on Amiga samplers a year or two back. It was so sick
  really punk.

  @{b}15. Thank you for your time Vicky and the best of luck with your manga 
      series, before we finish up is there anything you would like to add 
      or comment on?@{ub}

  Thank you, it's a pleasure.

 	 @{b}Invent's Corner@{ub} - by: @{"Kevin Saunders" link kevinsaunders}
============================================================================

  As the end of the year approaches, it's time to reflect on 2022 and start 
  thinking about priorities for 2023, Amiga, Classic, NG and Other.

  For classic Amiga's the game @{b}Reshoot Proxima III@{ub} is getting ever closer 
  to release. Richard, Martin and myself are extremely proud of our third 
  and final in the series (well at least it's my last in the series). 
  Richard and I have worked closely over the years on these games and I am 
  honoured to be working with him and our great team. If you haven't 
  visited AmigaBill's Twitch please do as Bill certainly please our demo 
  really well. Don't forget to visit Richard's preview youtube demo here: 
  
  https://youtu.be/_fLdudinjHY

  @{b}Aquabyss@{ub} is finally released, I really enjoyed working with Peter on his 
  Amiga project, and while I have various posts on the development process 
  on my blog, the best place to visit the project is on Peter's website 
  here: 
  
  https://agedcode.com/agedcode/en/

  What's happened to @{b}Boss Machine@{ub}, not much but it's always on my mind. Dan 
  who is a great friend and local coder in Brisbane certainly deserves more 
  of my time on this project, he is also one of my generous Patreons and 
  deserves more of my time and attention. 2023 will be given a lot more 
  attention for this very exciting project. For all the behind the scenes 
  please visit here: 
  
  https://www.patreon.com/KevinSaunders?filters[tag]=BOSS%20Machine

  The last few months have been focused on @{b}Apollo Invaders@{ub} for anyone who 
  has a V2 or V4 Vampire card. Gunnar, Arne, Martin and myself have been 
  enhancing the game. My recent involvement was adding 100 custom locations 
  from famous locations around the world where you play (destroy) the 
  aliens in. Last week I was finalizing the win victory section. The time 
  now must be spent testing and tweaking any elements we need to improve. 
  More info is usually posted in our Apollogames channel on Discord: 
  
  https://discord.gg/Um5KZ5uqDk

  After @{b}Apollo Invaders@{ub}, I plan on creating a shoot em up for the Amiga 
  Vampire machines called @{b}Apollo X@{ub}, besides having two player options we
  plan on a few more exciting features, definitely, one game to follow and 
  the best place is, of course, my blog or Apollo discord. I do also have a 
  placeholder on Facebook. 
  
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/419549690142105

  @{b}The Amiga Art Contest 2022@{ub} this month Doug and I announced all the 
  winners. We had a great selection of entrants and it was a real joy being 
  part of the selection panel alongside our Patreons. If you missed the 
  live stream or want to see all the entrants' creative submissions please 
  visit here: 
  
  https://www.amigaartwork.com/gallery-2022.html

  Brilliance II, as you all may know is my favourite art program for the 
  Amiga. I do try and push a few pixels when I have time. I have worked on 
  a few more Portrait animations for my personal project called No Signal, 
  a huge animation project using only Brilliance II. If you have or want to 
  be part of this project please contact me at the contact details listed 
  at the end of this page. I have another project called The Divide which 
  is another animation I am working on. To view the image please visit 
  here: 
  
  https://www.patreon.com/posts/divide-wip-74428053

  Other projects I have worked on for the Amiga but as yet I am unable to 
  mention due to confidentiality, however, if these projects come to light 
  I will be definitely promoting :)

  So what am I doing in 2023?

  * Boss Machine (AMIGA)
  * Killawatt (AMIGA) Port using scorpion engine."
  * Apollo X (AMIGA/Vampire shoot em up)
  * 2 x 3D projects for the (AMIGA) Vampire
  * Fruity Caves - Boulderdash clone (PC/Browser with Brother)
  * Dungeon Crawler- no title yet (eg Gauntlet/Fairy Tale - PC/Browser 
    game with Brother)
  * Thruster II (PC - James Roberts - who I worked with on Iridium and 
    Lunar Jetman Remake)
  * Project Nova (PC - James Roberts)
  * Unlisted new Project for AMIGA (more info coming soon)
  * Possible Judge for the AMIGA Art Contest for 2023 (unless I enter my 
    No Signal@{ub} animation)
  * Not sure what else but usually there are a few other things that happen 
    throughout the year.
  
  As you can see, I have possibly too many projects on the go at the moment 
  and need to find a way to give more balance to my life and family, and I 
  must point out that I have been considering moving out of the Amiga Scene 
  after the end of next year or the following year. I can say Boss Machine 
  and Apollo X will be definitely completed before this time.

  Take care and till next time, Amiga Forever :)

============================================================================
	      @{b}Future Imagineer: A New Podcast@{ub} - by: @{"Vicky Lamburn" link vickylamburn}
============================================================================

  In this edition of WhatIFF, you will probably be pretty tired of hearing 
  from me by now what with having an interview, shell talk piece and now 
  this as well? The good news is you can hear even more from me if you tune 
  into my brand new podcast "Future Imagineers".

  Following on from my interests as a creative myself, I decided having 
  written that opinion piece for WhatIff to take matters into my own hands 
  and turn the mic towards creatives using both retro and modern equipment 
  to create interesting and new pieces of artwork, music, photography, 
  publications, video, games and much much more. Rather than be rooted in 
  nostalgia that doesn't move forwards, I wanted to create a podcast to 
  celebrate the active use of this stuff that means it will continue to 
  have relevance in the future and not only be a historical footnote.

  Whilst it won't necessarily be always Amiga centric, it will feature 
  interesting people who not only like older equipment, such as the Amiga, 
  the Yamaha DX7, Akai S900, Nikon FM cameras and goodness know what else, 
  but it will ask them the questions of why their choices are so integral 
  to their creativity. Furthermore, it's about opening this up to an 
  audience way beyond the retro crowd, such as the youth of today so they 
  too can see the possibilities that come of mixing and merging retro and 
  modern technology.

  You can find the podcast on Spotify, and soon Apple Podcasts as well as 
  many others, as well as my YouTube channel (see links below).

  My first guest is Ant Jarvis who talked with the podcast to explain his 
  use of the Newtek VideoToaster to create his beloved Amiga show The Amiga 
  Show on YouTube. From exploring what the kit is, and how he goes about it 
  and what he would do if it broke as well as how he wants to progress the 
  show, it was a very interesting discussion!

  Future Imagineers is intended to be an open door for all creatives to 
  both listen and take part, be they on YouTube and social media or not. No 
  matter what it is you create, be it entirely retro, or a mixture of retro 
  and modern, even including emulation I'd love to hear from you if you 
  fancy being interviewed. You can email the podcast on the details below.
