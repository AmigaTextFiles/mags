<P><B><CENTER>Voodoo Add-on for Picasso IV</CENTER></B>

<P>VillageTronic have announced that they will be producing a 3D Voodoo I add on card for their Picasso IV.

<P>Unsure of the demand for such a product, they asked for preorders - only if 500 were received would they go ahead with it. At first it seemed unlikely - the Amiga is already a small market. A Zorro card rules out a large number of users, yet here we have a card that requires you to have a Picasso IV. But in the 
end 520 orders were receieved, along with almost 700 interests.

<HR><B><CENTER>Dual G3 Board from DCE</CENTER></B>

<P><P>DCE have announed a dual G3 board. It will actually be a Zorro 3 card - this is good news for those with A3/4000s, and would also automatically work with the BoXeR, but A1200T users will need a rather expensive Zorro3 board.

<P>It will not make use of a 680x0 processor, but do 680x0 emulation instead (which, on two G3s, should be '060 level!) using Haage &amp; Partner's soon to be released 680x0 emulation for PowerPC.

<P>Unfortunately, this means you'll be stuck to using Zorro graphics cards like the Picasso IV, rather than something like the CybervisionPPC - even if you also have a CyberStormPPC, you wouldn't be able to access the Cybervision via the G3s. But as stated above, the Picasso IV isn't now so bad - The Voodoo chipset should provide 3D performance somewhat better than the Permedia 2.

<HR><B><CENTER>Phase 5</CENTER></B>

<P>Phase 5 look hopelessly behind schedule as always, and it's unlikely we'll ever see the pre-Box, let alone A\BOX (even though 
they haven't official cancelled the projects).

<P>They have at least finally released the BlizzardVision and CyberVisionPPC graphics card, both of which now come with 8MB VRAM. Price cuts have also been seen on the PowerPC boards.
