                     <B>'Digital Gnome'</B>

                     Gates is the name, software's the
                     game
                     And I possibly own your home
                     I own everything else it's
                     completely insane
                     I'm the ultimate DIGITAL GNOME.

                     Bill's the name, monopoly's the
                     game
                     I'm completely obsessed with a
                     future
                     Where the web is for me and nothing
                     is free
                     In your cybermall computer.

                     I'm worth twenty-six billion the
                     papers say,
                     More than the Sultan of Brunei
                     With a million a day in minimum pay
                     I'm a ve-e-ery interesting guy

                     I began in a shack at the back of
                     the track
                     Paid a pittance to a man for DOS
                     Showed it round at IBM , did a deal
                     with them
                     And the other guy made a loss.

                     Control of the net's what I wanna
                     get
                     Including your personal site
                     See the system's free, it doesn't
                     suit me
                     You must pay for every byte.

                     My helpers confess the new
                     browser's a mess
                     But I want it your only brand
                     'Cos the ultimate test of my
                     business finesse
                     Is to run ev'ry screen in the land.

                     I write a lot of tripe, I get a lot
                     of hype
                     And my product's strictly a loser
                     But I don't smoke a pipe, I'm a
                     workaholic type,
                     And you won't see me down at the
                     boozer.

                     Thousands of workers are writing
                     the words
                     for my information highway codes
                     I'm making damn sure that the
                     internet nerds
                     Pay to drive on my roads.

                     With Windows in phones and all the
                     other clones
                     I'll just have to be trusted
                     'Cos what's been forgotten by
                     website drones
                     Is monopolies used to get busted.

                     A year on your net costs nearly
                     five thousand
                     While a US local call's free
                     I think I might raise a few billion
                     pounds and Acquire control of BT.

                     A free-for-all internet's a thing
                     of the past
                     I consider it sheer perversity
                     We need so many brains to privatise
                     fast
                     I'm buying up Cambridge University.

                     Gates is the name, obsolescence the
                     game
                     And I possibly own your home
                     I own everything else it's
                     completely insane
                     I'm the ultimate DIGITAL GNOME.

                     You've reached World
                     Software's technical team
                     OH NO!!!
                     Hullo, guten tag,
                     buon giorno
                     We know our package can
                     make you scream
                     And you're itching to get to the
                     porno.

                     You probably dialled a hundred
                     times
                     Piling curses on our name
                     But we're all tied up on a couple
                     of lines
                     Sorry if that sounds lame.

                     If the telephone you're using is an
                     analog one
                     Please rip it out of the wall
                     Dealing with losers is not
                     much fun
                     And we frankly don't welcome your
                     call.

                     If you've digital kit and
                     must insist
                     You might as well hit `star`
                     Clench your fist and join the list
                     Of callers waiting an hour.

                     If you've got snags with our
                     internet servers
                     Hitting One wouldn't hurt
                     But we keep track of all you

                     that'd be strange Our stuff is
                     likely to crash.

                     If you want to plague us
                     with why we cost twice
                     the BBC licence fee
                     When we sell a quite small

                    'Internet Ernie'

                    I'm INTERNET ERNIE
                    I do love to journey
                    By tapping on plastic keys
                    I can smoke if I like
                    No one's ever on strike
                    And I poke in my nose where I please.

                    From Bophutatswana
                    To deepest Guyana
                    I fly at the flick of a finger
                    I can pop to Nepal
                    Or nearby Bengal
                    And if I desire I can linger.

                    I can check out the span
                    of a bridge in Iran
                    with hardly a move of my hand
                    I get tons of reports
                    On American sports
                    and even find things that are banned.

                   Just last week
                   I was browsing in Greek
                   And the other day it was Spanish
                   When chatting in Russian
                   I can end the discussion
                   By simply choosing to vanish.

                   The other day
                   I was in Bombay
                   With no discomfort from heat
                   It's truly cathartic
                   To visit the Arctic
                   If protection from cold is complete.

                   My flights make no noise
                   I travel with poise
                   The police never ask for my papers
                   Unlike the crowds
                   That pollute in the clouds
                   I pay few pence for my capers.

                   If thereís altercations
                   In exotic locations
                   I can escape with the greatest applomb
                   Because people aren't armed
                   One cannot be harmed
                   And I'm never in fear of a bomb.

                   It's perfect bliss
                   Gadding round like this
                   And never being stung by a bug
                   I've a flying computer
                   It works like a super-
                   charged digital Persian rug.

                   The thing that I've found
                   Is, to stay on the ground
                   And fly using cyberspace
                   Keeps the ozone layer there
                   Gives the planet a prayer
                   And a chance to the human race.

                   I'm INTERNET ERNIE
                   And I love what I learn
                   When I search with Excite or Yahoo
                   The wisdom of ages
                   the knowledge of sages
                   just comes to me out of the blue.

                   I'm INTERNET ERNIE,
                   without an attorney
                   and only a single screen
                   But I range round the globe
                   In my satin bathrobe
                   With far greater ease than the Queen.

                   The one thing I dread
                   Which screws up my head
                   With outrage beyond description
                   Is this monetary con
                   They want to try on
                   Of credit card encryption.

                   My software will crash
                   Iíll come down with a splash
                   As my travels become illegal
                   the answer is clear
                   if I want to stay here
                   And continue to fly like an eagle.

                   Web surfers like me
                   Who travel for free
                   Without any fiscal backing
                   Must dodge financial ruin
                   And a digital screwing
                   By rapidly switching to hacking.

                     VOICE 1
                     E-mail friend if you mean what you
                     write
                     There's certainly something about
                     it
                     The feeling you convey makes me
                     feel so right
                     That I wouldn't like to live
                     without it.

                     It's a personal question and I
                     probably shouldn't
                     Express it in a message this way
                     I tried to hold back and found that
                     I couldn't
                     So I'm hoping it's works out okay.

                     I've made up my mind and I'm
                     sending down the wire
                     The most sensitive question in the
                     world
                     You inspire me so much that I have
                     to inquire
                     Whether you're a boy or girl.

                     Hello hypertext connection this is
                     just let you know
                     I'm ignoring your inquiry of last
                     night
                     A person's sexual gender is hidden
                     in their clothes
                     And sending your inquiry wasn't
                     right.

                     VOICE 1
                     Look, I'm putting the question with
                     a beating heart
                     And feelings that are warm and
                     tender
                     Put aside netiquette 'n make a
                     fresh start,
                     Please let me know your gender.

                     known by protocol

                     manners since then
                     If you think the rules are written
                     so that you can break them all
                     Well, perhaps I shouldn't WRITE to
                     you again.

                     VOICE 1
                     Okay skip the question of man or
                     woman
                     You'd better forget what I said.
                     Instead just act like a real warm
                     human
                     And copy me a picture instead.

                     doesn't matter

                     something strictly out of line

                     it's fine

                     to me
                     Talking 'bout a time when the net
                     was free.

                     It's commercialised now by greedy
                     men
                     One day, you'll make it free again.

                     What you've got to learn is, it's
                     just not funny
                     Trying to make all our knowledge
                     cost money.

                     CHORUS: All gather round and listen
                     to me
                     We've got to fight for a net that's
                     free.

                     A pound-eighty a week for the BBC
                     Is a price that counts as more or
                     less free.

                     Five times that is paid for cable
                     Trade monopolies charge what
                     they're able.

                     Once a popular net cost nil
                     Now modem squeaks are the ring of a
                     till.

                     CHORUS: All gather round and listen
                     to me
                     We've got to fight for a net that's
                     free.

                     Encryption passion's hardly
                     surprising
                     It all boils down to monetarising.

                     The rush is on to invent a widget
                     To force to you pay for every
                     digit.

                     When did commerce make people wise?
                     Can trade make what inventors
                     devise?

                     CHORUS: All gather round and listen
                     to me
                     We've got to fight for a net that's
                     free.

                     If we let profits take over the net
                     The Beeb won't last on the TV set.

                     If they want to seize our digital
                     rights
                     They'll have to accept a tax on
                     bytes.

                     They'll see grabbing the net was a
                     blunder
                     When we take revenge on all the
                     plunder.

                     CHORUS: All gather round and listen
                     to me
                     We've got to fight for a net that's
                     free.

                     Community finance is how we'll
                     resist them
                     Decentralise funds and seize their
                     system.

                     Throw out companies that take us
                     for fools
                     By sneaking commericals into our
                     schools.

                     The vision that founded the BBC
                     Will live on to build a net that is
                     free.

                     CHORUS: All gather round and listen
                     to me We've got to fight for a net
                     that's free.

                     CHORUS: All gather round and listen
                     to me-e-e (hold) We've got to fight
                     for a net that's free.

                     Eight thousand computers a day you
                     buy
                     they'd make a stack over two miles
                     high (@52cm).

                     A year's computers heaped in piles
                     could load juggernaut lorries for
                     20 miles.

                     This upgrading racket
                     is costing a packet
                     by definition you buy too late
                     cos the day it's delivered it's out
                     of date.

                     The industry knows when it hits the
                     street
                     processor and software are
                     obsolete.

                     All the speed and greed and haste
                     is leaving a mountain of toxic
                     waste.

                     The megaherz added hour by hour
                     recklessly builds consumption of
                     power.

                     Yet the bigger the network gets
                     the more you're riding cars and
                     jets
                     mate, you're a primate
                     that's changing the climate.

                     You're getting so lazy,
                     driving like crazy
                     when there's a net you can get
                     if you met on the net
                     you'd quit the jet set
                     'n never get wet.

                     A half-hour connection from london
                     to leeds
                     takes a fraction the energy your
                     car trip needs
                     one trip in 10 done working on-line

                     stops burning half
                     what-milford-haven refines.

                     Take for example the lottery you
                     play
                     it adds to your shopping trips,
                     surveys say
                     thirty thousand more a day,
                     play on the net, send pollution
                     away.

                     Ask petrol producers and see what
                     you hear
                     you British burn six billion
                     gallons a year
                     the internet way, you'd have
                     nothing to fear.

                     Why buy travel or holidays by wire
                     when the jet that you get sets the
                     ozone-layer-on-fire?

                     It's gonna mean trouble
                     if jet flights double
                     With a click on the mouse you'd fly
                     round the world
                     leaving the sky looking pure as a
                     pearl.

                     Forget your concorde and mad
                     supersonics
                     stay on the ground and use
                     electronics.

                     Don't be a petrol monkey
                     or a polluter flunkey.

                     Take heavy computing off your desk
                     make a network link and forget the
                     rest.

                     Wanna planet?

                     Scan it.

                     Rearrange
                     the climate change

                     Let's go clean
                     with an internet scene.
