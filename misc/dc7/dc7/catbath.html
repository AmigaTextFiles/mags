<P>Some people say cats never have to be bathed. They say cats lick themselves

clean. They say cats have a special enzyme of some sort in their saliva

that works like new, improved Wisk, dislodging the dirt where it hides

and whisking it away.



<P>

I've spent most of my life believing this folklore. Like most blind believers,

I've been able to discount all the facts to the contrary, the kitty odours

that lurk in the corners of the garage and dirt smudges that cling to the

throw rug by the fireplace.



<P>

The time comes, however, when a man must face reality: when he must look

squarely in the face of massive public sentiment to the contrary and announce:

"This cat smells like a port-a-potty on a hot day at the Glastonbury Festival."



<P>

When that day arrives at your house, as it has in mine, I have some advice

you might consider as you place your feline friend under your arm and head

for the bathtub:



<P> Know that

although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack of concern for

human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize on that advantage

by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him in an open area where

he can force you to chase him. Pick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom

is more than four feet square, I recommend that you get in the tub with

the cat and close the sliding glass doors as if you were about to take

a shower. (A simple shower curtain will not do. A berserk cat can shred

a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than a politician can shift positions.)



<P>

Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the skin

from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know how

to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top

construction boots, a pair of steel mesh gloves, an army helmet, a hockey

face mask, and a long sleeved flak jacket.



<P>

Prepare everything in advance. There is no time to go out for a towel when

you have a cat digging a hole in your flak jacket. Draw the water. Make

sure the bottle of kitty shampoo is inside the glass enclosure. Make sure

the towel can be reached, even if you are lying on your back in the water.

<p>Use

the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to simply

carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your strange

attire. They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule. If he does

notice your garb, calmly explain that you are taking part in a product

testing experiment for J.C. Penney.)



<P>

Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In a

single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure,

slide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with

shampoo. You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life.



<P>

Cats have no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem

is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more than

two or three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember

to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring

free and fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national

record for cats is three latherings, so don't expect too much.)



<P>

Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this part

will be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this point

and the cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying is simple

compared to what you have just been through. That's because by now the

cat is semi permanently affixed to your right leg. You simply pop the drain

plug with you foot, reach for your towel and wait. (Occasionally, however,

the cat will end up clinging to the top of your army helmet. If this happens,

the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage him toward

your leg.) After all the water is drained from the tub, it is a simple

matter to just reach down and dry the cat.



<P>

In a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg. He

will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend a

lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psycho ceramic

and develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine.



<P>

You will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the case.

As a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defences and injure

you for life the next time you decide to give him a bath.



<P>

But at least now he smells a lot better.
