<h2><Center>Instructions</Center></h2>
<P>Do  not  start  until you are told to do so.  You will be  allowed  10
minutes  to  complete  the  test.  Mark  your  answers  in  the  space
provided. Work as quickly as you can.

<P>
1.  Some months have  thirty days,  some months have thirty one  days.
    How many months have twenty eight? _____
<P>
2.  If  a  doctor gave you  three pills and told you to take one  pill
    every  half  hour,  how long would it  be  before  all  the  pills
    were taken? _____
<P>
3.  In a dark room, in a drawer, there is a bag containing black socks
    and brown socks, in the ratio 5 pairs of black socks to 4 pairs of
    brown socks.  How many socks would you need to take out to  ensure
    a matching pair? _____
<P>
4.  Divide thirty by a half and add  ten.   What is the answer? ______
<P>
5.  A farmer had 17 sheep.  All but nine died. How many live sheep did
    the farmer have left? _____
<P>
6.  If  you had only one match and you  entered a cold and  dark  room
    where there was  an oil heater,  an oil lamp and  a candle,  which
    would you light first? _____
<P>
7.  A  man  builds  a  house   with  four  sides  and  of  rectangular
    construction,  each  side having a southern  exposure.  A big bear
    comes along. What colour is the bear? _____
<P>
8.  Take two apples from three apples. What do you have? _____
<P>
9.  How  many animals of each species did Moses take  with him  aboard
    the ark? _____
<P>
10. If  you  drive a  bus with 43 people on  board  from  Chicago  and
    stopped at Pittsburgh to pick up 7 more people and drop off 5 more
    and at Cleveland you drop  off 8 people and  pick up  4  more  and
    eventually arrive at Philadelphia 20  hours later.  What  was  the
    name of the driver? _____<br>
<P><h2><Center>The Answers</Center></h2>
<P>1.  12 Months.  ALL months have 28 days.
<P>
2.  1 Hour.  Let's say you took the first pill at 1PM,  the next would
    be at 1:30 and the third one would be at 2PM.
<P>
3.  3 socks. If the first one you pull out was black, and the next one
    brown, then the thrid one must match one of the other two.
<P>
4.  70.  Work it like this:  30/0.5+10=70.  Many people would say that
    the answer is 25, but that is 30 multiplied by 0.5, not divided.
<P>
5.  9 sheep were left, as all but nine died.
<P>
6.  The first thing that you would light would be the match.
<P>
7.  This one is particular sneaky, and catches many people out. If the
    house is rectangular, and all walls face south, then it must  have
    been built on the North Pole, which  means that  the colour of the
    bear must be white, as it is a polar bear.
<P>
8.  3 apples.  If it was "Take 2 apples AWAY from  three apples"  then
    you would only have one, but you did not do this so you still have
    three apples.
<P>
9.  None. It was Noah that took  the animals with him  on the Ark, and
    not Moses.
<P>
10. This is the nastiest one of the  whole lot.  Ignore the adding and
    subtraction of passengers - that it not the issue.   What you  are
    interested in is only the first five words of the puzzle:  "If you
    drive a bus ....".  Hence the name of  the driver is your name, so
    if I was to do this puzzle,  the driver of  the bus would  then be
    called Stephen, and if Mark Harman also did the puzzle, the driver
    would then be called Mark.
