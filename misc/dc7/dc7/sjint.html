<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><U><B>Millions of men fancy you. Have you always had
a problem fighting them off?</B></U></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
Not at all. There was a time when I could'nt even get a boyfriend. I was
always a tomboy when i was younger. I seemed to have enormous kneecaps, Large
teeth and long, gangly legs. I was really geeky.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>Can you remember your first
kiss?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
Yes. It was terrifying. I'd Gone on a date to the cinema with this boy and
he suddenly started kissing me everywhere - my ears, my neck, my nose. I
thought he was some kind of weirdo! Then later, I saw a movie where this
couple were doing exactly the same thing, and I realised everyone does it!
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>When you were single, did you ever try chatting
up a man?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
I only did it once. Me and a girlfriend were in this hotel. I saw this fella
I fancied, but I did'nt have the nerve to go up and talk to him. So I scribbled
him a note and got one of the hotel staff to give it to him. He opened the
note, Looked across at me - then walked off!
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>Have you ever lied to get out of a
date?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
I suppose I must have, but in a kind way. All girls must have at some point.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>What's the first thing you look for in a
man?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
I got married recently, so I'm not looking anymore! With my husband, Mauro,
it was'nt anything physical. It was his sense of humour. Being able to make
me laugh is always a turn on!
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>How did the two of you meet?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
Through a friend of a friend. I was 17. We swapped numbers, then went out
for dinner five or six times and a month later, got together. It was gentle,
quiet and slow, but it instinctively felt right.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>How do you know when you're in
love?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
Different people react in different ways. You get lonely when the person
you love isn't around. You get a funny, queasy feeling. You go off your food.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>Are you romantic?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
I think so. But not all the time. Occasionally, it's nice to have a meal
with candles on the table, and to have someone say nice things to you.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>Do you believe in monogamy?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
I do now, but me and Mauro split up once. We'd been going out for seven years
and I got a seven - year itch. I did see other people, but I soon realised
it was Mauro who iI really wanted.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>What's the strangest place you've ever had
sex?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
In a deserted health club, really late at night, when no-one was around.
We did it in a comfy corner. I've done it in a jacuzzi too, which was quite
interesting because the bubbles go everywhere...
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>What do you like/hate most about your
body?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
I like my belly button, It's nice and neat. I do hate my feet, though. My
second toe is longer than my big toe. Ugh!
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>What do you wear in bed?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
An old T-shirt or nothing at all, depending on the weather. But I do wear
socks, because I always have cold feet.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>What kind of food do you buy?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
I love seafood, but i'm very choosy, so I only buy it from really good
fishmongers.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>Do you spend a fortune on
clothes?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
Not really. I like things that fit well and look good. Playing Mandy in <I>Game
On</I>, I get to wear some really classy dresses. From time to time, I'm
able to but the clothes afterwards, At a reduced price. I've got one black
trouser suit that looks absolutely stunning.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>Where do you most like to shop?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
Since Mauro is Italian and Italy has always been my favourite country, I've
got to say Milan. Everyone knows they've got some of the best fashion houses
in the world and the Italians are known for their style. If I could afford
it, then I'd shop there any day.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>What are your plans for the
future?</U></B></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center>
I can see myself at 40 as a successful woman, with a large house and three
beautiful children. I'm already craving a child.
