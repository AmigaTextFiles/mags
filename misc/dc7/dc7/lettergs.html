<h3>
<P>Hi there...
</h3>
<P>Just a little mention to say that I thought the Double Click 6 on this month's
CU Amiga is exceptionally good.. It's the first one I've seen, but I'll be
sure to look up some other ones.

<P>Secondly, I see you say Jesus on Es is not HD installable. That's not 100%
accurate.. There WAS an HD installer released about 2-3 years ago, and it did
work, as I played it several times from HD...

<P>Unfortunately, I don't have it anymore.. Not quite sure why not, as I normally
VBSd everything I had back then - nowadays I use a CDRW, that's progress I
guess :-)

<P>Perhaps you could mention you're looking for the installer? Someone is bound
to have it! Oh, and I'm not sure where I got it.. I suspect it was the PD
stall at the Barras market in Glasgow.. This stall is no longer there thanks
to their association with the (ahem) less reputable computer stalls that were
there - serves 'em' right :-)

<P>Well, there you go.. A bit of useless useful information :-)

<P>Cya!
