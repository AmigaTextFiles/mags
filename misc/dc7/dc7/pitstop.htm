<P>Crooks hoping to net £6,000 of prime beef turned pale after stealing a
lorry outside a meat factory in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Insode, they
found 33 human corpses destined for experiments at a nearby medical
school.

plate.  Los Angeles authorities said it was offensive to Japanese
Americans.

<P>Amazed Russian trawlermen netted a Ford Fiesta as they fished the
1,000 foot deep Barents Sea in Norway.  A Norwegian patrol boat helped

diagnose what's wrong with your car by listening in the studio on
headphones to the sounds the engine makes.

<P>Britain's first completely unmanned fuel station has been opened by

<P>A "Fast Track" through the driving test will be available from 29
Spetember, with candidates able to get the results of their theory

around the UK will offer the service, which costs £25 instead of the
usual £15.

<P>Del Boy's favourite motor (not the Capri Ghia) could soon be doing its
bit to save the planet, as Reliant introduces a secret prototype of a
new electric Robin this November.  If everything goes to plan, the
model could be in prduction within 18 months, costing under £10,000.
Reliant is also considering reviving the wacky Bond Bug (ask your
parents) - a space age three wheeler it prsuced in the Seventies.  If
it goes ahead, the Bug would be powered by a new engine and given more
up to date looks.

<P>Drivers may be forced to take an in car breath test before starting
their car under new plans being considered by the Government.  A House
Of Lords committee has put forward a proposal for a dashboard mounted
device which the driver would have to blow into before turning the
key.  If the gadget registered the driver as being over the limit the
ignition would be cut.  A similar device is on trial in Canada and the
US.

<P>In USA, New Jersey residents took an ice cream man to court to make
him change his van's repetitive chimes.  Jeffrey Cabaniss (the ice
cream man) won the case, but admitted that he too was sick of hearing
the tune and has now bought some others to play.

<P>In France, car thief Jacques Morel didn't fancy travelling by bus

driving on a main road.  William Atherton, 81, of East Lothian, later

controlled "guided roads" to avoid accidents.  The link could be in
place in 15 years.

Ambulance Service.  Four in five people don't know how to help
casualties injured in road accidents, and two in three are even
putting lives at risk by doing the wrong thing, the brigade's
research shows.

<P>Being a victim of road rage is the number one fear of drivers,
according to a new US Government survey.  In response, the American AA
has suggested traffic cops include suspected road rage incidents in
reports, so that judges can force drivers to attend anger management
classes.

<P>In Iran, a man was jailed for 21 years after cops caught him with

bathroom and kitchen firm to mark its 60th anniversary.

advised motorists not to stop for red lights in certain areas after
dark.

<P>The number plate R1NGO went under the hammer for £5,000 at a recent
DVLA sale.  Other money spinners included L1VER, which made £16,000,
and B15HOP, which sold for £16,500.  But the top seller was L4URA,
which went for £30,000 to a man who bought it for his 15 year old
daughter.

software controlling the nation's traffic lights, which could cost
£14.3 Million to fix as computers crash.

<P>A full sized model of a police car has been placed by the M4 in

miles is being assessed by Chrysler in the US. The coolant, developed
in conjunction with Texaco, will now be tested over two years.

<P>Motorists who use mobile phones while driving are as dangerous to
other road users as drink drivers, says a new study.  Sober motorists
using mobile phones often have heated conversations, which lead to a
lack of control similar to that suffered by a driver who has been

distraction for drivers, and dialling out is judged to be as dangerous
as reading a map when behind the wheel.
