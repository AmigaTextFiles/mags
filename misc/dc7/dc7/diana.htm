<hr>Elton John re-released "Candle In the Wind" as a single
<br>but now that Diana is buried he should've re-released "Island Girl" instead.
<hr>Did you know Elton John sang a song at Dodi's funeral?
<br>Goodbye Fellow Prick Dod.

<br>"I'm still standing"
<br>Or...
<br>... Crocodile Tear Rock
<br>... Saturday nights alright for driving
<hr>What is Di´s new job?
<br>Model at Versace´s
<hr>What do Diana and Versace have in common?
<br>They both get screwed by queens and die.
<hr>Why did Lady Di go and die?
<br>She wanted to be the first to try on the Versace Summer 98 Collection.
<hr>Candle in the wind (as originally drafted)
<br>Goodbye Princess Di
<br>May they all forget you were a tart
<br>And have the grace to shed a tear
<br>Before the rumours start
<br>You went out of the country
<br>And you tried to hide in vain
<br>They saw you in the tabloids
<br>You really should have changed your name
<br>But it seems to me your driver was
<br>Over three sheets to the wind
<br>Never knowing what had happened
<br>When the roof fell in
<br>And I'd have liked to have seen the photo
<br>But then I'm just a lout
<br>Your minder will die of heart disease
<br>Before the truth gets out
<br>Royalty was tough
<br>Those regal ears without a dick
<br>Imagine bedding that one night
<br>We can see you had to split
<br>And 'specially now you're dead
<br>Oh the Brits are all contrite
<br>But when you were alive
<br>They really couldn't give a shite
<br>Goodbye Princess Di
<br>From the young man who doesn't want to know
<br>Who thinks you've run off to the Caribbean
<br>To live with Marilyn Monroe
<br>(and JFK, Elvis Presley, Jim Morrison, Hendrix, Luther King, Maxwell et al.)
<hr>Candle in the wind (take two)
<br>"Goodbye Diana-queen, though I never new you at all, I fantasized about
you, while in the shower stall..."
<br>..."Even when you died, the paparazzi photographed you, while at the
same time, took your pulse to make sure you wouldn't come alive...."
<br>..."And it seems to me, you lived your life, like an adultress in the
castle, never knowing, who you slept with, so the prince would give you
hassle."
<br>"I would have liked to love you, but I was just a queer, I slept with
Charles long before, your highness ever did..."
<hr>LONDON, Oct.1 (Wire Service) - After  the recent "overwhelming" response
to the re-dedication and performance of his "Candle In The Wind" at the
funeral of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, pop singer Elton John has
remade
several of his other old hits into tributes to Diana.  His song from
Goodbye Yellow Brick Road entitled "Bennie And The Jets" is now
"Diana And The Press."  Following are the new lyrics.
<br><hr width="60%">
<br>DIANA AND THE PRESS
<br>Hey kids, the couple's not together
<br>Diana tried to reach out but the Prince he wouldn't let her
<br>We see it in the headlines now every day
<br>You know the press is gonna make a killing now anyway
<br>Say, Diana dating Dodi, have you seen them yet?
<br>The news is that he drives her wild
<br>D-D-D-D Diana and the Press
<br>Oh, but she's real and she's wonderful
<br>Diana she's really keen
<br>She's got her Bally boots, Versace suits
<br>You know I saw it in a magazine
<br>D-D-D-D Diana and the Press
<br>Hey kids, plug into the faithless
<br>Maybe we're blinded
<br>Diana makes us ageless
<br>We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
<br>When we lose all of our own sense of guilt and say who's right and who's wrong
<br>Say, Diana did her duty, have you seen her yet?
<br>The news is that it drove her wild
<br>D-D-D-D Diana and the Press
<br>Oh, but she was real and she was wonderful
<br>Diana she was really keen
<br>She's got her Bally boots, Versace suits
<br>You know I saw it in a magazine
<br>D-D-D-D Diana and the Press
<br>Di, Di, Di, Diana and the Press
<hr>I heard Di gave the paparrazzi the finger and also some of her toes as well!
<hr>Where were Dodi and Di going when they were being chased by the Papparazzi?
<br>To meet a Pole
<hr>Did you hear that three paparazzi died in a tunnel the other day?
<br>They were being chased by Danii Minogue.
<hr>When I saw the headline "Paparazzi hunts Di to death", my immediate reaction was: "I'll never buy another of his records!"
<hr>Why did God invent the cockroach?
<br>So the paparazzi could have someone to look down to.

<br>"Over my dead Dodi."

<br>And after the crash: Hey! This is better than the OJ case. Could you bleed a little more? I need more colour.
<hr>What was the last thing Diana said to the paparazzi?
<br>No more pictures, I'm a bloody Princess!
<hr>Apparently, Diana had a pizza in the Ritz before the fatal journey.
<br>She asked for extra paparazzi.
<hr>What's the difference between the paparazzi and Princess Di?
<br>The paparazzi dig for dirt, Di dug for gold.
<hr>All 7 journalists are being charged with ma'am-slaughter.
<hr>What does Diana's bumper sticker say?
<br>My other car's a decoy.
<hr>The paparazzi asked Prince Charles if he has had sex since divorcing Diana.
<br>He replied, "infrequently." The paparazzi responded by saying, "Is that one word or two?"
<hr>How many paparazzis does it take to kill Di?
<br>50. One to drive in front of Di and 49 to take pictures.
<hr>How did The Royal Family stop the paparazzi from visiting Diana's grave?
<br>By placing Land mines around it.
<hr>Press release from the National Enquirer:
<br>"Following the gross misconduct of paparazzi at the scene of Princess
Diana's death, we have decided that, after the funeral, we will no longer
be accepting photos of Princess Diana for publication."
<hr>The first of the Papparazzi on the scene heard Di say "help me". So he
brushed her hair and put some make up on her. He then began snapping. A
second scumbag arrived and hearing Di's plea's for help, put her head
resting on the shoulder of Dodi and moved her hand between Dodi's legs.
"There that's better!" he sais and start snapping away. Finally a well
respected member of the Papparazzi arrived and immediately assesed the
situation. He ran over to Di, ripped open her blouse and yelled "show us
your tit's love!". Yet another member of this puke infested mob arrived but
he was so drunk that he fell of his bike and landed in a pool of oil. He
staggered to his feet and lit a cigarette. He immediately went on fire and
as he screamed and blazed furiously, another member of the scum arrived,
grabbed the flaming bag of shite and moved him close to the car so he could
take better pictures in the light. The the man with the EXCLUSIVE stickers
arrived and stuck them all over the car. An American tourist arrived and
quickly rushed to the car. Sticking her head inside the wreck she said:
"can I have your autograph? I' ve seen all your movies". Finally the French
Police arrived to accept the bribes, clear the way for the Papparazzi to
get more shots and to arrest three Black youths seen in the vacinity. They
are now helping the Police with their enquiries.
When told the news, the Queen Mother had an orgasm, the Queen turned to
his lover and said "are there any crap songs I can re-release?", the Duke
blamed the frogs and the Prince said that there was no way she would
survive an accident like that so he ordered a new one from BMW.
<hr>Mother Teresa and Princess Di are up in heaven. Mother
Teresa sees Di and wonders why Di has a huge halo around her head. Mother
Teresa asks God why Di has a huge halo for doing some work with the poor and
why herself has a small halo for devoting her life to helping people. God
says "Mother Teresa don't tell anyone, but that's not a halo". Then he whispers "Its
a steering wheel".
<hr>Just heard the details of Mother Theresa's death...
<br>It seems she died in a fiery crash of her rickshaw.  After dining at the
Calcutta Ritz with her playboy boyfriend, they were being pulled wildly
through the streets trying to avoid the paparazzi.  Rumours have started
that the rickshaw driver was drunk.
<br>So sad, two in one week.
<hr>Princess Diana and Mother Theresa have died and are at the Pearly Gates.
Saint Peter says, "Tell me a little about what you did on earth."  The
first one says, "I lived among sick and diseased people on the lowest rung
of society. Every day I heard them cry out wanting more and more of me."
"Yeah" said Saint Peter,  "Those Paparazi are real scum. You can come in
Di." Then he turned to the other woman. "What about you Mother Theresa?
<hr>Why did Mother Theresa die of a heart-attack?
<br>She had the same heart doctor as the one who worked on Princess Di

<hr>From This weeks Private Eye: Gnome - The Late Princess Diana, an
Apology:
<br>IN recent weeks (not to mention the last ten years) we at the Daily
Gnome, in common with all other newspapers, may have inadvertently
conveyed the impression that the late Princess of Wales was in some
way a neurotic, irresponsible and manipulative troublemaker who had
repeatedly meddled in political matters that did not really concern
her and personally embarrassed Her Majesty The Queen by her
Mediterranean love-romps with the son of a discredited Egyptian
businessman. We now realise as of Sunday morning that the Princess
of Hearts was in fact the most saintly woman who has ever lived, who,
with her charitable activities, brought hope and succour to hundreds
and millions of people all over the world. We would like to express
our sincere and deepest hypocrisy to all our readers on this tragic
day and hope and pray that they will carry on buying
our paper notwithstanding.
