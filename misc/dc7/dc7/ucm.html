<P>Those of you who are heavily into the PD scene, and also buy Amiga Format
CD edition regularly, will no doubt have heard of Bernard Cain's B-Card,
Business Card Creator. Well, this is about to get some competition
from us here at Trogladite Software.

<P>UCM (Ultimate Card Maker) will feature things which are not available in
B-Card such as multi language support, 16 colours and not 8, print one
card, or tiled on the page, 500 level undo, place text anywhere on the
page, along with boxes, lines, and other shapes. You can use any font
on your computer and there are many more features besides!

<P>UCM has a friendlier interface which imitates that of Workbench, and
there is another unique feature which will really aid the creation of
cards, and that is the 'Wizard' server tool built into UCM. This allows
people to create a simple script and UCM can run this, and users
of UCM can usee the wizard script to create cards simply by typing
things in which the wizard can use!

<P>There are many example cards available, and lots of wizard scripts
too! We are looking for Beta testers, and the best source of information
is the UCM webpage, which you can find at:

<P><A HREF="www.trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk/secosmain.htm" TARGET="_top">www.trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk/secosmain.htm</A>

<P>If you want the latest UCM information emailed to you, then send an
Email to:

<P>trogladite@trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk

<P>and put 'UCM Details' in the subject line. You will be sent an automated
reply with the most up to date details available!
