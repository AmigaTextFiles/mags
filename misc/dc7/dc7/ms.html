<H1><B><CENTER>So I Do a Little Microsoft</CENTER></B></H1>

<PRE>So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it. 
After all they sell it on the streets and it's advertised in the press and on 
television, so it can't be that bad.

So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it.
No effort at all, the nice man who brought it in did the works for me, man what
a fix, he made it look so easy. "You only pay for the system we give you 
everything else for free". He said with a smile.

So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it.
I felt the rush straight away, wow all those colours, heaven I thought as I got
to work surfing the Web, printing pictures, writing letters. That evening I 
leave work happy.

So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it.
Hm seems a little slower today, can't think why, must be me, log on to the 
Microsoft Web Page, aha, need to update my software, download and install, that
should solve it.

So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it.
Boot up OK, no wait an error message, what's this ????? "Mouse Driver not 
found, press Left Mouse Button to continue" HUH !!!  I'll reboot.

So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it.
Boot up OK, ARGGHH............. another error message "Keyboard not found, push
F3 to continue"  sigh.................... reboot.

So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it.
Error messages all the time, can't understand why, haven't produced any work in
hours, starting to get anxious, sweating a bit, hm head aches as well.

So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it.
Call the Microsoft help line, "you are in a queuing system, please wait and you
will be attended to shortly", I wait 40 minutes listening to some awful music, 
my boss comes in, "hey I'm waiting for an important call" he says, I put the 
phone down, the call never comes, another job opportunity missed I guess, sigh 
!!!.

So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it.
I don't feel well at all, my boss is not happy, must do something, Call the 
Microsoft help line again, "you are in a queuing system, please wait and you 
will be attended to shortly", I wait 40 minutes listening to some awful music 
and then have to rush outside to be sick, I go home and go to bed.

So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it.
I'm covered in sweat, my hands are shaking, my head throbs, " Oh please God 
work today" I mutter in prayer, YES !! full boot up, now to catch up on 
yesterday, feel much better, oh oh ! that's strange, the printer wont work, 
error message " Printer Driver not found or corrupt, please download and print 
latest help file, I'm sweating again and there is a throbbing pain behind my 
eyes.

So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it. 
Call the Microsoft help line, "you are in a queuing system, please wait and you
will be attended to shortly", put down the phone very gently, my head pounds, 
I glare at the useless machine in front of me in anger and frustration, wait a 
minute the guarantee, I'll call out the engineer.

So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it. 
Call the Microsoft help line, "you are in a queuing system, please wait and you
will be attended to short..", SLAM !!! down the phone and start weeping.
 
So I do  a little Microsoft, I can handle it. 
That's it into the bosses office, straight in without knocking, it's quiet, too
quiet, he's slumped back in his chair, the handle of a letter opener jutting 
out of his chest, he's quite dead, suicide !!!, he's killed himself. Even 
though I feel numb I notice the message on his monitor screen.

"From Microsoft HQ, A covert scan of your hard disk revealed an E-Mail to Amiga
Inc requesting information about their computers, Mr Gates will be arriving in 
person to de-brief you on your error in one hour"</PRE>
