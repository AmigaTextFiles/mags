It seems the internet is a breeding ground for many of the more obscure
problems of the mind. All I can say is, I wish I had my tie and blazer
badge back from the League of Quack Psychiatrists, I could make a mint
(MMmmmmmmm minty!) curing everyone. But alas after the problem with the
goldfish and the road drill, well......
<P>
So to our first patient, a truly troubled person.....

<BR>>Dear Mannaz,
<P>I'm part of a small, travelling band of midget
clowns.
<P>Yesterday, Chuckles, the leader of the troop
took me to one side after
<BR>the show and told me I was too tall to continue
with the group (I'm 6'4").
<P>Now I don't know what to do.&nbsp; Midget Clowning
is my whole life.&nbsp; I have
<BR>no other skills apart from cat restoration
and that field is saturated
<BR>with fresh, young graduates straight from
college.&nbsp; I've considered
<BR>re-training in a useful skill like pig shaving
or computer programming,
<BR>but I don't know where to start.&nbsp; I'm
a little frightened and
<BR>overwhelmed.
<P>Please help ... I'm tall and confused.

<P><I>You poor, poor shorty. I see your point about the cat restoration,

here</I>

<BR><I>in the UK the unemployment lines are full&nbsp; of unemployed cat

restorers.</I>

<BR><I>In fact there was a movie about a group of them who restored a cat</I>

<BR><I>called 'Monty'. Although I was told that the cat in question was

stuffed</I>

<BR><I>with porridge.</I><I></I>



<P><I>I recommend that you go the way of Pig Shaver, not Computer Programmer.</I>

<BR><I>I can see no future for one of your talents in any computer company,</I>

<BR><I>exept maybe Apple.</I><I></I>

<UL> Dear Mannaz. 



<P> Since I was a lad, my club has always been

quite an impressive tool, But 

<BR> lately, my good friend Pebbles has not been

so interested in my almighty 

<BR> piece of wood (I think she prefers playing

with Dino and that bad 

<BR> tempered Sabre-toothed cat these days). 



<P> Should I just throw away my amazing club handling

skills and strength 

<BR> and head down the alley to play with my Dad

and Fred's balls, or would 

<BR> bowling be a waste of my talents? 



<P> I really miss the sound of her giggling as

I banged away... I just don't 

<BR> know what to do, how can I make Pebbles notice

my club once again?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR><I>Bamm Bamm,</I>



<P><I>&nbsp;I wouldn't worry if Pebbles is taking more notice of the cat

than of</I>

<BR><I>you. This as most men know is the normal state of affairs. Women

love</I>

<BR><I>cats, no one knows why. After all it's not like a cat is as good

as a</I>

<BR><I>dog!</I>



<P><I>&nbsp;But your 'banging away with your club' this is a problem. At

the start</I>

<BR><I>of a relationship just banging away is fine. But, as life goes on

women</I>

<BR><I>want a little more. Not more club - more subtlety. Remember it's

not how</I>

<BR><I>big your club is but what you do with it that counts.</I>



<P><I>&nbsp;If she doesn't come back to you don't worry. There are plenty

more</I>

<BR><I>pebbles on the beach.</I>

<BR> Dear Mannaz. 



<P> Please help me. 



<P> I don't know if I am a boy or a girl and it's

becoming quite a concern. 

<BR> Every day I have to face new problems....

it's not only confusing 

<BR> deciding whether to go into the male or female

toilets, but which 

<BR> technique to use when urinating (I use the

women's way, just to be on the 

<BR> safe side). 



<P> This is just one of the many problems... filling

out forms with a "sex" 

<BR> question, which underwear to buy.. I mean,

what if I am male and I've 

<BR> been wearing women's underwear or vice versa? 



<P> I can't take the strain of not knowing any

longer. Is there a simple test 

<BR> to find out, maybe something simple like jumping

in a river to see if you 

<BR> sink or float? 



<P> Any help would be much appreciated.

<P><I>But seriously many men enjoy the feel of women's underwear rubbing

<BR><I>their proud...... STOP THAT! <B>DON'T GO THERE!</B></I>



<P><I>Sorry.... I'm in control again.... honest..... ahh the feel of the

<P> Dear Mannaz, 



<P> My hobby is cat juggling.&nbsp; Recently, a

friend pointed something shocking 

<BR> out to me, that people in general don't approve

of cat juggling and 

<BR> actually consider it animal abuse.&nbsp; Oh

dear, now I don't know what to 

<BR> think.&nbsp; Should I continue my relentless

practice in throwing the 

<BR> purrfect (pardon the pun) Triple Gyro Kitty

Swing (a legendary cat 

<BR> juggling move that is extremely difficult

to watch never mind execute), 

<BR> or give it all up and bow to public pressure?&nbsp;

Please Mannaz, help me, 

<BR> tibbles, croaky, bobbins and snufflemufflegus.&nbsp;

We're all confused.

<P><I>While some people see '<B>Cat

me</I>

<BR><I>more is you attempts at the 'Triple Gyro Kitty Swing'. Don't you

realize</I>

<BR><I>the number of injuries associated with this move? Why I remember

my own</I>

another</I>

tell</I>

<P> Dear Mannaz, 



<P> Over the past few weeks I've been experiencing,

what I can only describe 

<BR> as "strange urges".&nbsp; They come upon me

whenever I am near wooded areas.&nbsp; I 

<BR> suddenly find myself unable to move and feel

compelled to stand with my 

<BR> arms out-stretched.&nbsp; I have even taken

to carrying assorted leaves around 

<BR> with me for some unfathomable reason.&nbsp;

I could have coped with this if it 

<BR> wasn't for a sense of impending doom that

assails me whenever I hear 

<BR> wood-peckers or see paper.&nbsp; Can you help

me....... 

<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your problem is quite

straight forward. You are a natural conduit for</I>

<BR><I>tree like earth force. I have heard stories of an ancient druidic

sect</I>

<BR><I>that your family line may descend from. Most of them (it was a LARGE</I>

<BR><I>sect) lived near Nottingham in England but, they disappeared about

the</I>

<BR><I>time that the Nottingham forest gained in size by 50%. I think you

may</I>

<BR><I>be descended from the branch that came over to America on the Mayflower,</I>

<BR><I>well that's not strictly true, they weren't ON the Mayflower they

WHERE</I>

<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the best thing

you can do is find yourself a little spruce and</I>
