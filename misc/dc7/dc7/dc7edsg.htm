<P><h2><b>Hello Readers,</b></h2>

<P>Hi there.  Before I start, you may notice that we now have our own
<a href="mailto:dclick@softhome.net">E Mail Address</a> which you can
now mail us at.  The address is active all year round, so you do not
need to worry about sending anything to us during the holidays - we
shall still get it!
<P>Well, by now you shall have noticed that this is written in HTML
code, which has been a first for me since this I started the mag all
those years ago (is it that long Mark!!).  I have peppered this
document with links all over the place to Websites.  This is really
meant for the readers that are reading this on line, so I apologise
now to all our non modem owning readers.  We still luv ya!!  For those
who are connected to the Internet, We have created a list of
<a href="dclinks.html">Interesting Links</a> to some websites and also, you can see a list of
files I personally have written by clicking this
<a href="#Links">link</a> which will take you to the end of my Editorial
(this file), so all you should have done is click the link on the last
line (oops you will not be reading this if you have done that!!).  Oh
well.
<P>Well, I figure that by now, most of you will be tearing out your
hair trying to figure out the answers to the quiz I ran last issue.
To put you out of your misery, I have supplied you with the
<a href="answers.htm">Answers</a> to the quiz, as well another copy of the
actual quiz, just in case you missed it, and this is your first issue
of Doubleclick!. We have been doing this for a few years now, and we
are now into our seventh issue, so what is your excuse?
<p>I also have made up another <a href="nquiz.htm">Quiz</a> in case you
thought the last one was too easy.  I guarantee that this one will
have you thinking for a while.

As I type this, my brother is still working on a solution to the Amiga
and  Z88 file transfer problem.  We are ignoring all the diagrams that
we  have seen so far,  as they all do not work,  apparently.  We  have
made  up  our  own  cable,  assisted by my dad,  who  yields  a  devil
soldering iron,  and we can now get the Z88 to transfer a file to  the
Amiga,   which  is  what   we   were   wanting  in  the  first  place.
Unfortunately,  we cannot seem to get the Amiga to  send  anything  to
the  Z88,  but,  hey,  the day's not done yet.  Full updates  will  be
forthcoming - please read on.
<p><center><IMG SRC="amlogo.gif"ALT="The best computer in the world"></center><br>
I  must  congratulate Nick Abott from PD Plus on his  first  issue  of
"The Ripper" Diskmag.  I have a mention in his contacts database, as I
am  a long standing penpal of Nick's.  Good work,  and I hope that  it
all  goes  well for you.  Sadly, as I have since found out, this is not the case.  Nick has decided
to change over to a PC (Boo Hiss!!).  He has handed over running of the mag to a friend of his,
Barry. I was told about this from another of my penpals, and also from a an email from Nick himself.
 I will not publish Nick's address now, as planned, just in case you feell like firebombing his
house.  So listed below is Barry's address.
<P>If  you want a copy of the mag,  then please either contact
<a href="contact.gif">me</a> or
contact Barry directly,  and we shall supply details about the mag.   I
am unsure just now about price, as I was sent a complimentary copy, as
I am a nice person,  who would give the mag some free advertising (you
don't mind a bit of healthy competition, do you Mark?).
<P>You can write to Barry at:
<br><address>
<br>Barry
<br>20 Rose Hall Walk
<br>Haddington
<br>East Lothian
<br>EH41 4DQ
</Address>
<P>Send any new diskmags for a review to our <a
href="contact.gif">address</a and we will see what we think.

As ever,  I am on the scrounge again. I have relived my youth [what do
you  mean  youth  - you're only 22!  - Mark] and I managed  to  get  a
snapshot  of  the  game I played almost non stop on  my  ZX  Spectrum,
Subterranean  Stryker.  Now,  as the Amiga is a far superior  computer
that the ZX,  I was scared that the snapshot would run too fast on  my
Miggy.  Not so,  as the emulation is just perfect, but I feel that the
game  is  now  more responsive,  probably due to a very  slight  speed
increase,  although this is not noticeable.  Anyway, onto my plea. Has
anybody got any cheats for this game,  especially ones that would  get
me  further than the end of Level 3,  as this is as far as I can  get.
Still,  that it a great achievement,  as I could barely get to Level 2
when I played it on the ZX,  and only once managed to get to Level  3.
Now that I can save the snapshot of course,  when I get to Level 3,  I
have a bonus inthat I don't have to repeat all the levels that I  have
already completed.  If anyone wants a copy of the snapshot files, then
please  contact  me - this is one game that Dixon's  sold,   that  was
ignored by everybody else - one of the best, if you ask me.

Well done to one of my penpals,  Ian Charles Fyvie.  He sent me a disk
a  while ago with some recipes on it,  called Cut Cost Cooking.   This
disk was not really meant to go out on public release, but after a bit
of persuasion,  he has decided to finally release a copy.  On it there
is about 30 odd recipes on how to make some great dishes, ranging from
Cream of Tomato Soup, to Apple Turnovers, and homemade hamburgers (BSE
beef is not an option).
<P>The  disk has a slightly Scotish feel to it,  as my penpal comes  from
Cumbernauld  in Scotland,  and there is even a recipe for  traditional
Scotish Dumpling,  and no, that is not a daft person, but a very tasty
cake.   If you want,  I can send you a copy of the disk -  send  me  a
blank disk and return postage,  and I shall pop one off to you in  the
post.   No  postage  means that you will  not  be  guaranteed  a  fast
turnaround, but you will get your disk eventually.
<P>If  you want to get the disk direct from the author,  or even send him
your own recipes for the next version of the disk,  then you can write
to him yourself. Contact:

I Hope that many of our readers will not take this too harshly,  but I
have maybe overstepped the mark.  Last week (middle of April) my brother and I bought  a
PC!   Sorry,  and all that,  but he wanted to get it for his Uni work,
and  when  it  comes to programming Java,  plus Internet stuff,   HTML
coding easily,  then the PC is the best thing to go for.  Never  fear,
as  we  still will have the Amiga set up 24 hours a day in my bedroom,
which means that I get it all the time, as it was in his room before.
<P>Although I don't like PC's all that much, this one is a pretty
storming setup, although not as good as I really, really want:
<P>Cyrix M2 200 MMX CPU (Not as good as Intel, but almost just as good)
<br>Pentium Motherboard with 512K Pipeline Burst Cache
<br>4.3GB Ultra DMA Hard Drive
<br>64 MB RAM (Yeeha!!)
<br>4MB Video RAM (SVGA)
<br>33.6K Internal Modem
<br>1.44Mb Floppy Drive (Of course!!)
<br>Mini Tower Case
<br>15" SVGA Monitor
<br>120W Stereo Speakers
<br>16 Bit 3D Stereo Sound Card
<br>24 Speed CD Rom Drive
<br>Windows 95 Keyboard
<br>MS Compatible Mouse.
<P>What  really excites me is the speed of the Hard Drive - it is clocked
at going mega fast - it has a transfer rate of 33MB per second (yes 33
Megabytes, not Kilobytes).
<P>I have already bought a stackload of CD's to go with it as well.  I
will have installed Windoze 95,  MS Office,  Grand Theft Auto, Grolier
Encyclopedia,   Money Matters (not the Digita one),   3DFX  (Rendering
package  -  the extra RAM / P200 Processor should make it  run  rather
wickedly)  by the time you read this.  Plus I have loads of  Shareware
stuff,   and  game demos for it.  I also have Quake  and  Quake  II  -
excellent games and no mistake.  Also, the day they release Grand
Theft Auto on the Amiga, is the day that I am a very happy bunny!
Now, I do not want to wax lyrical about the PC, as this is, and always
will be, an Amiga magazine, but GTA is one magic game.  Ask anyone who
has played it on a PSX (Playstation), and they will say the same.
<P>I  am  not sure,  but I will probably be able to view my Phillips  CDi
films as well,  so I might be saving for a Win TV card, to allow me to
take  screenshots from any films that I have.  Also,  the 3D  FX  Card
would probably be on the cards soon,  as is a digital camera, although
if  I  get the 3D FX card,  this will not be required,  as I can  take
pictures with my camcorder, and capture them this way.
<P>Never  fear,  as I will still be heavily involved with the Amiga.   If
readers  are interested,  we could start a PC Section in the magazine.
Please write to me and let me know if you would like to see this,  as,
after all, it is a magazine for the readers.
<P>This  is  written in the future tense for a reason.  By the  time  you
read this,  I will have the computer,  but at the time of writing,   I
don't  have it (04.04.98).  I expect it to be in on Wednesday 8 April,
which will be a day where I get no sleep!!
<P>Hopefully,  the mag should be full of some stuff that I have got  from
the Internet - A great Star Trek Picture for all you fans,  as well as
various documents that I have pinched from Websites all over the world
and beyond!
<p><center><IMG SRC="amlogo.gif"ALT="Support Shareware"></center><br>
Well,  managed to get the cable working fine.  Now,  the Amiga and Z88
are conversing perfectly, except that the program I am using, FileZ88,
hangs up after we transfer a file from the Z88 to the Amiga,  although
the file crosses over OK,  and as the wonderful Amiga Multitasks,   we
can copy it from the RAM:  to another device. My brother is working on
a new program to replace FileZ88,  because of this problem, plus there
are no file requestors,  and you have to save to Ram:, plus the GUI is
far from perfect.

I  read  with sadness in the Amiga section of Computer Shopper,   that
Fred  Fish has finally decided to hang up his fishing rod,  and  cease
releasing Amiga software.  He started in 1986, releasing disks of good
quality  Amiga  Shareware & Public Domain software,  concentrating  on
quality,  more than quantity.  His software collection soon grew,  as more and  more
programmers sent him their masterpieces,  hoping to be included in his
next batch of releases.  He then concentrated on making CD's with  the
software on it instead of floppy disks,  as the user would get a  much
better deal for there money.
<P>It was not long before other people were emulating their releases, and
trying to simulate the benchmark that Fred had already established.
<P>It is a pity to see him go from the Amiga world,  as he has brought  a
great  many  quality  programs  to an even  greater  audience  (myself
included).  A great figure who will be sadly missed.  As for how  long
it takes him to achieve the same results in the PC world - well we can
only wait and see.
<p><center><IMG SRC="amlogo.gif"ALT="Buy an Amiga"></center><br>
You may have noticed that in the list above of my new computer set up,
that  I  also included a 33.6K Internal Modem.  I now can get my  mail
sent  to  my house directly (to my own personal E-Mail address  -  not
public  [Except to you,  Mark]).  This means that I can  now  download
stuff, as well as upload stuff to the Aminet etc, as well as act on my
E-Mails  quickly,  instead of having to wait until they were delivered
to me on a floppy disk.
<P>While  I was "Surfing The 'Net" (sorry,  but I hate that phrase,   but
cannot think of anything else right now), I visited the
<a href="http://www.digita.com">Digita Website</a>.  I downloaded the PC version of Wordworth,  which is
exactly  the  same  as  the Amiga Wordworth  V6,   with  maybe  a  few
exceptions.  This is my favourite Word Processor,  which I use  daily,
and  have done for many happy years,  since V1.1,  right up to current
day.
<p><center><IMG SRC="amlogo.gif"ALT="You know it makes sense"></center><br>
Well, I tried my CDi films - only Video CD ones work, so ones that are
marked  Digital Video for CDi will not work,  as they use a  different
system.  I can still watch Beverley Hills Cop 1 & 2, as well as Waynes
World  etc,  so it is not a total loss.  In theory,  I could send the  files
over  E-Mail  to  someone,   but for  one,   that  would  be  breaking
copyright,  and as they are over 10Mb in size,  it would be easier  to
just  buy another copy of the disk,  as this would be cheaper than  E-
Mail, funnily enough!
<p><center><IMG SRC="amlogo.gif"ALT="You can't program on a PSX!!"></center><br>
My  Sunday's  are a bit boring now that Ballykisangel and  Father  Ted
have finished.  Glad to see that Have I Got News For You is still on -
an excellent programme that should never be missed.
<p><center><IMG SRC="amlogo.gif"ALT="Babylon 5 can't be wrong"></center><br>
I  ran  this  plea to readers last issue,  and so far have  hit  brick
walls regarding replies to this, so I will ask again, in the hope that
somebody out there can help me:
<P>Can  anyone  supply me with a cable to connect my Z88 Laptop  computer
(yes,  the one made by Sir Clive Sinclair) to my Amiga A1200? I have a
software package that can handle data transfer,  but any more programs
would  not go a miss.  Please contact me anytime at the above address,
phone number (although remember it is a Mobile phone,  although I  can
probably call you back,  as my calls are free),  or E-Mail address.  I
am willing to pay postage for the cable and / or disks as well.  I  am
quite  urgently needing this,  as I now have found a good use  for  my
Z88, and connecting it to my Miggy would be a BIG help.
<P>I  have  a cable and the software (see further back in the Editorial),
but  I  want to get another complete package (preferably from  someone
who  has  done this sort of thing before)  to see if it  works  on  my
Amiga, and also to use as a backup, as well as wire to my A600.
<P>While  I am in my "please help a poor Amiga User" state,  and  that  I
have  got  you  reading  anyway,  I  want  to  pick  someone's  brains
concerning Amigaguide documentation.  My problem is that I want to  be
able to display an Amigaguide in colour, with some text one colour and
some another.  I know how to get white,  and red, but I cannot get any
other  colours.  I saw a guide once that used blue,  but did not  find
out how it was done.  It is possible, but I cannot see how. As for the
other mags,  they are not really interested in how to do it.  AF ran a
one  off tutorial a few months back,  but it was VERY basic,  and  did
not  cover  much.  Pity they did not keep it up,   as  I  was  looking
forward  to  learning  more  about  it,   as  I  am  used  to  writing
Amigaguides (Just look at the two I write for the mag for  examples  -
you  are welcome to load it into a text editor to see how it is done).
Is there any learned people out there who will take pity on my soul?
<p><center><IMG SRC="amlogo.gif"ALT="Easy PC - nah, don't think so!"></center><br>
I  loved the articles in all the computing magazines about Micro$oft's
amazing Windoze '98.  even Big Bad Bold Bill cannot get it to work, as
it  crashed in spectacular fashion in front of the world's media.   To
say  that he was embarrased would be an understatement,  and I  quote:
"That's  probably  why  we haven't shipped  Win98  yet!".   I  have  a
Quicktime movie on the PC of said incident.  Everytime I  run  into  a
problem on either my Miggy or the PC,  I watch the movie,  just to let
me know that I am not the only person having problems!!
<P>I  also read that Bill is now the worlds officially richest man,  with
an  amassed wealth of over $50 Billion (that's a lot of zero's).  This
is ever increasing every single day,  so by the time you read this, he
can probably afford to buy the moon - three times,  along with Saturn,
just to keep it company.  Obviously,  this puts him well ahead of  the
Sultan of Brunei,  a car crazy man, who has almost as much money as he
has cars.
<p><center><IMG SRC="amlogo.gif"ALT="RIP Jay Minor"></center><br>
I  wrote  to  Digita a few weeks ago (well,  the middle of April  '98,
depending on when you read this),  enquiring about the PC  version  of
their  mighty Wordworth,  of which I have been a long term user,   way
back since V1.1.  I was sent the PC version one,  which to all intents
and  purposes is just like the Amiga V5 / V6.  I suppose  they  cannot
release V5 on the PC scene,  as users would want to know what happened
to the first four versions!
<P>Not surprisingly,  it is just like the Amiga version. Nice to see that
they  have  not  changed  anything   to  please  the  picky  PC  user.
Transferring files from the Amiga version to the PC version,  and vice
versa,  is proving to be a bit of a pain. The actual text crosses over
OK,  but any special touches, like Text Frames, and Graphics, of which
I  use greatky,  as any person who writes to me would know,  are sadly
lost, when you import to the PC version, which I feel is just a waste.
Needless to say,  I still use my Miggy to do all my letters,  of which
I do many.  The only problem is that I am now using a crappy Panasonic
9 Pin Dot Matrix,  as the colour printer is on the PC. I may be buying
an  Inkjet  soon,  though,  which means I get my colour  printer  back
again on my beloved Amiga.

I must say a heartfelt thanks to Tony Horgan, the Editor of CU
Amiga.  I went out and got my usual copy of CU, only to find that
there was no sticker in it, although there should have been, according
to the cover.
<P>Well, I sent an e-mail to Tony, and I got a reply in less than 24
hours.  Now, I know he is a busy man, but to actually spend time
writing to us personally really is the difference between CU and AF.
I have written to AF a few times, and have only had a reply once, and
that was through the mag - not a personal one.  Alan, my brother, has
also had messages from the guy who makes the PD collections for CU
Amiga about his program Radman.  Sorry, but his mame escapes me just
now.  I am, of course, writing this on an Amiga.  His name is on an e-
mail upstairs on that inferior machine, the PC.
<p><center><IMG SRC="amlogo.gif"ALT="Have you completed Myst yet?"></center><br>
I read the new issue of CU Amiga (July '98) with interest.  I see
that Carl Read, a long term penpal of mine, has finally had his
diskmag, Shareworld Magazine, reviewed in the PD Pages.  Now, We have
not appeared on these pages for quite a while, but we have been
included on the coverdisk CD's, so I suppose we are still getting
press.  This is an excellent magazine, and worthy of anyones money.  I
get a newsletter from Carl every few weeks via E-Mail (get connected -
it is a whole new world), and he now has a
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Haven/7504/shareworld.html">Website</a> dedicated to the
mag, the same as we do.  If you do not have access to the Internet,
you can still get the magazine on a 2 disk format, either from me or from one of the following
people:
<br><address>
<br>Carl Read
<br>Cybercraft
<br>PO Box 14032
<br>Mayfair
<br>Hastings 201
<br>New Zealand

<br>Andrew Jackson
<br>7 Nut Tree Close
<br>East Huntspill
<br>Near Highbridge
<br>Somerset
<br>TA9 3PN
</address>
<P>It is free, if you send them two disks and a Stamped Addressed
Envelope, for people who are in the UK, or an International Response
Coupon for the rest of the world. You can of course get it from me as
well.
<P>Hope that you get loads of response, guys.  I will write to you
all soon.

Aarrgh!!! What will I do now.  Have I Got News For You has now stopped
for the summer, and will not be back until September!!!  First Father
Ted and Bally, and now this!  At least I can still watch the new
series of Friends on Sky, but then no doubt that will get chopped as
well.  I used to watch all the Formula One races on the tv, but for
some reason, this year is just not as good.  Now, I am a big F1 fan,
so to say that hurts, but it is the truth.  I personally think that
their is too much politics involved in it, and I am not just talking
about the famous £1Million that Bernie Ecclestone gave to the Labour
party.  I would not be surprised if there is a bit of race fixing
going on, but as I cannot prove it, I will not accuse any teams of it.
Yes, even McLaren (oops - have I just made a grave error?).  If
footballers can do it, why can't F1 drivers.  They get paid roughly
the same, although I do not think I would die if I crashed into a
corner flag, or even a linesman come to that!!!

I read with great interest in the July 1998 issue of PC Format, from
the stable of the mighty Amiga Format, that Nick Veitch has written an
article about the new 'November boxes'.  Now, most of you will
probably realise that all he had too do was shout through the wall to
some PC owning net junkie (wouldn't be me - would it???).  No - he
probably just sent it as an E-Mail!!!
<P>Well, this is not getting the point across!!  The main reson of the
article was to say that PC owners will soon be able to run Amigas on
there superiorly inferior PC's.  Access Innovation have come up with a
nice 'Inside Out' card which slots into a spare PCI slot on the PC, so
that you can use it just like a current A1200.  It will be shipped
with Workbench 3.1, so all those jealous PC owners can play Sensi
Soccer and Worms the way they were really meant to be played.
<P>In the meantime, Amiga Inc have not said much about the new Amiga
OS.  Basically, deals have not been struck, so it is a bit up in the
sky (well, it is at the time of writing this - 22/06/98), but as with
anything in the computer world - that will surely change soon.  A
number of different avenues are being looked into, and all we are
being told is that MS Windoze is definitely NOT on the cards (Thank
God for that).  Most favourite option will be a version of BeOS, which
was developed for the mighty BeBox.

Fancy seeing what your house looks like from space?  Well, now this
could be a reality.  Now that the Cold War is supposedly over
(although things in India and Pakistan seem to be hotting up!), there
are some Spy Satellites that are spinning around in the cosmos,
seemlingly doing nothing or are they?  Go to the following site, which
is full of <a href="http://www.terraserver.com">Russian Spy Satellite
Photos</a> of most of our lovely planet.  You can zoom in to your
town, and near enough your street.  It does not zoom right in to tell
you what issue of the Radio Times is lying on your patio beside the
sunbed, but the resolution is good enough that you can see your garden
shed (well, I can see mine).  Problem being is that if you want a copy
of the zoomed in photo, you need to pay some dosh (all major credit
cards accepted).  I think you might be avle to get a snapshot of the
screen, and then load it into a photo manipulation package, although I
did not tell you this!!
<P>It is quite worrying that all the scans cover almost the whole of
the world.  All you have to do is click the button "Find a spot on
Earth", type in your location (town, country etc), and take it from
there.  You can move in any direction, in and out, and move in any
compass direction, until you find the area you are looking for.  Roads
and everything stand out like a sore thumb, and I could actually see a bus 
standing at a bus stop in one of the main roads in our town.
<P>It is just a pity that the scans are not really pin sharp, as I would
really like to know how accurate they could get.  It would be very
nice if you could see how many cars were parked in your street.  I
think that there is enough technology up there to allow the men in
power to read the paper sitting by your pool, but I doubt we will ever
see the full potential.
<P>You can rest easy, if you are worried about getting caught out,
just in case you were walking down the street, and you have an
unfeasibly large head, as all these scans were taken some time in
1992.  They could have phoned, and I would have put my good jacket on!

I am getting slowly addicted to talking to people on Yahoo Chat.  For
those who do not know what that is, let me explain.  Basically, it
is like a CB radio, except you know who is listening to you
conversation, and you can talk to as many people as are in your room.
The chat site is best described as a massive hotel.  Every room in the hotel
is a different conversation, and to change conversations, you just
move to another room.  Now there can be hundreds of people in one room
- or conversation, which makes it too crowded.  For this reason,
duplicate rooms are created if it gets too crowded.
<P>Everyone who is chatting uses an id or nickname to describe
themselves.  My nickname is <b>Stickyspanner</b>, due to the work I do with
cars etc.  I have seen some pretty sad names as well like
Icantgettosleepwiththishardon, or sexy_bitch_1998.  These are extreme
cases, and they usually just hang about in one place, usually the
romance section, where people just spend all the time talking dirty to
each other.
<P>There is of course much more that you can talk about.  It is
possible to visit a room and play a game of Trivial Pursuits, or your
can go to the regional rooms, and talk to people who live in your area
of the world.  Most of the users on Yahoo are from America, where it
is very popular, as they do not pay for their phone bills, unlike us.
<P>In saying that, the phone bills do not have to be extortionate.
Most Internet Service Providers (ISP) charge their phones at local
rates, so at the weekend, it only costs you 1p per minute, and this
wil be less if you put your ISP on your BT Friends & Family (which
reminds me - I must do that sometime), so if you stay off of it during
the week, it will work out to be a lot cheaper than a night in the pub
(won't it Mark?).
<P>I only have a few haunts that I frequent on Chat.  I can usually be
found anywhere in the Computer section - usually the Chat Help or
Computer games.  Failing that, it is either Triviall Pursuits or the
UK regional site, where I have made a great many friends.
<P>Many people also advertise their own website on the profile that is
created when you sign on.  Initally, when you first use it, you have
the option of making a profile that other users can load in to find
out more about who you are talking to.  Most people are quite honest,
like me - check up if you like, but some people who, lets say are
male, make their profile up as if they were female, and even say they
are female in the gender section.  I cannot imagine who would do such
a thing (would you, Mark?).
<P>Anyway, all joking aside.  It is a good way to make friends, and
actually talk real time to someone In the USA without actually having
to pay the full cost of the phone bill.  Many of the "Internet
weddings" that you hear about are instigated from this.

<P>Not being one to hang about for long, and not liking Windoze 95 particularly, I decided to upgrade (can I call it that?) to Windoze 98.  I must say that if you are connected to the Internet for long periods (like me!! - last bill was £203!!!!!!!!!!), then Win98 might be for you (assuming you own a PC!)  There is a difference in the browsing speeds between it and Win95, although if you are not doing many downloading tasks, or Telnet & FTP tasks, and spend all the time in a Chat room, or using one of the great "buddy pagers" (ICQ, AOL IM, Yahoo Pager etc), then there will not really be a noticeable speed upgrade.
<P>The games that you get with the Plus Pack (yes, I bought that too!) are truly a great step up from the basic Patience and Minesweeper that you got with previous Windows versions.  There is a "connect 5" style game, Loose Your Marbles, and it is truly brilliant.  Also, you get those nice Themes as well, which means you can change all the sounds, icons, backgrounds etc, just by one click.  Most are rubbish, but there are soon good ones out there.  Best ones are on the Internet sites, which you should make an attempt to download.
<P>You may be getting bored by all this Micro$oft buttering up by now, so time to change the tempo.  Also I (well, my brother as well!) have taken the great step to install a truly brilliant Amiga Emulator on the PC.  We are using the latest version of WinUAE, and it is brilliant.  We now have a mini hard drive inside the great big PC one, where we store all our Amiga programs.  We are already using OctaMED SoundStudio, Personal Paint V6.4, Voyager, Wordworth, and a few good PD games from my vast collection.  Another upside is that I can view the PC hard drive from the Amiga side, and we are trying to get the Emulator to recognise the modem.  We already have the mouse, monitor and CD Rom under our belt (the first time I have had an "Amiga" with a CD Rom - mag disks here we come!!!).
<P>The good side to this is that I can now write the mag on the PC (I was using it mostly in the latter stages, although all the donkey work was done on the Amiga), and then load in the Amiga Emulator, and then Voyager to see what it would look like in an Amiga.  This is not a strict truth, as we are running the Emulator in 16 bit colour, although I prefer 256 colour, as the emulator does get a bit slow at times trying to keep up.
<P>Soon (probably by the time you read this) I will have our ZX Emulator, and probably Shapeshifter (MAC) running.  So we can then run a Mac or ZX Spectrum on and Amiga on a PC!!!!  Kewl or what?

<P>I was saddened to learn that CU Amiga have decided to cease printing.  The last issue will be released before you read this (we will be releasing this some time in October), so you will be too late to send them any flowers etc.  You can however send them a goodbye email at <a href="mailto:goodbye@cu-amiga.co.uk">goodbye@cu-amiga.co.uk</a>, and the best will be printed in the last issue.  I realise that this contradicts my last sentence, but there is a rumour flying about that when the new Amigas are released, CU Amiga MAY return.  Here's hoping.  Its a shame that the best mag, in my opinion, is now being laid to rest.  For the serious Amiga user (not all of us played ADoom all day y'know, although I did - purely for "recreational and research" purposes you understand!), I thought that CU Amiga was the best by a long way.  RIP - you will be sadly missed.

Oh, before I go - a quick Joke:
<P>David Bellamy, Ester Rantzen and Bill Gates have all died, and they go
to  see  God to see if they can be allowed into Heaven.  David  states
that  he has raised awareness to the public of the Natural World  that
we  live  in,   and  how all plants and animals can  live  in  perfect
harmony. He is allowed into Heaven.
<P>Ester then says that she has campaigned all her life to rid the  world
of  nasty people who are only there to con people,  and also  she  has
enlightened  people as to the amazing feats of peoples'  talking  cats
and dogs. She is also allowed in.
<P>Bill  Gates takes one look at God and says "Hey you - get  out  of  my
seat!).
