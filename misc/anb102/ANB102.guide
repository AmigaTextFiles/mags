COMMODORE KEEPS AWAY FROM BLACK
- "Softer than expected" European sales prevented Commodore from breaking back into the black for their second quarter results over the last three months of 1993. A loss of $8.2 million was made on a turnover of $70.1 million, compared to a loss of $77.2 million and turnover of $237.7 million for the same period in 1992.

NEW AMIGA STUFF ON SHOW
Commodore UK at the @{" European Computer Trade Show " link FeatECTS} in London put the CD1200 and A4000T on show. Both were switched on and working! Details follow:


AMIGA 1200 DRIVES FORWARD
- Commodore UK press release:

A working prototype CD drive for the Amiga 1200 has been developed by Commodore.

The much-discussed drive plugs into the best-selling computer enabling it to run Amiga CD32 software and audio CD. However, unlike the Amiga CD32, the drive cannot support MPEG full motion video, so applications will be restricted to games and information discs.

Commodore is currently studying the viability of a full UK release for the drive. Therefore a release date or price cannot be confirmed.


TOWER OF STRENGTH
- Commodore UK press release:

The most advanced Amiga yet has been launched in by Commodore UK.

The Amiga 4000 Tower is a major new arrival - the logical next step in powerful Amiga AGA computing. Its power derives from the Motorola 68LC040 25MHz processor and the classic AGA chipset. But the machine's special value lies with its expansion capabilities.

The "tower" comes with a built-in SCSI-II controller with support for up to seven internal and/or external SCSI devices. It also has five dedicated Amiga bays, making the Amiga 4000T the perfect machine for the expansionist professional user.

And although its expansive it's not expensive - it will retail for £1949.99 (inc VAT). Kieron Sumner, Commodore's national multimedia sales manager, said: "The Amiga 4000 Tower is the ultimate solution for multimedia professionals. We're convinced its price with specifications will open up all kinds of new high-end opportunities for us.

The Tower heads an Amiga 4000 range which also includes the Amiga 4000 030 and the Amiga 4000 040.

Historically users have demanded a variety of hard disk sizes. For this reason the machines are supplied without a hard drive so that users can meet their own requirements.

- Note: James Wright queried the 68LC040 with a member of Commodore's staff,
for Amiga Newsbits. They said that the press release was wrong and a full 68040 was included in the Tower.


WORDWORTH 3.0A UPDATE
- Press Statement by MD of Digita, Jeremy Rihll:

Four weeks after the launch of Wordworth 3.0, Digita announces
the release of Wordworth 3.0a. This technical update corrects
compatibility problems, improves operating speed and provides a
general tune-up to Wordworth 3.

Jeremy Rihll, Digita Managing Director said: With a product as
advanced and innovative as Wordworth 3.0, that took over ten
man-years to code, we expected a few teething problems;
especially with third party peripherals. However, I am pleased
to announced the solution, version 3.0a.

Our programmers have done an excellent job in responding so
quickly to customer feedback. Users will notice that Wordworth
now feels tighter and faster, includes enhanced file export
filters and drag and drop editing.

The Wordworth v3.0a is free to all registered Wordworth 3.0
users direct from Digita after April 12.


CHUNKY AMIGA NEWS
- It has been reported that AmigaDOS 3.1 is ready and also IDE is being dropped in favour of SCSI, by Tim Smith in the April 11 issue of CTW. He also writes that the Commodore Australia franchise has collapsed so the American-based Commodore Asia are likely to handle their affairs, and that World of Commodore in New York isn't to be sanctioned this year.

AMIGA CD INTERACTIVITY
- Goldtech Computer Systems claims that it has developed the first interactive Amiga CD magazine. CD Gold will have 10,000 copies produced, is expected at the end of April and will contain news, reviews, interviews and demos for any CD-equipped Amiga.

    @{b}INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS@{ub}


FIGHT OVER
- Data East have won an important battle for the whole games industry after Capcom were defeated when claiming that Fighter's History, a Streetfighter-style beat-'em-up, infringed copyright. Judge William Orrick said similar aspects were of common, unprotectable ideas in fight games.

ON THE SCROLL
- Nintendo have paid Atari for a licence to use its technology after legal action in which the US company claimed its scrolling patents were infringed.
A similar battle between Sega is looming. Atari's Tengen has also regained official Nintendo licensee status.

LOSSES CONTINUE
- Atari have once again continued low turnover figures with $8.5 million for the last quarter of 1993 compared to $25.5 million the year before, making a loss of of $22.7 million for the last three months.

JAPANESE GREETING
- Panasonic have launched their 3DO machine in Japan for Y54,800 (£365) and have received relatively massive sales of 40,000 within three days of launch to techno-hungry Japanese, outshadowing the first months of American buying.

MORE REALITY
- Williams will be using Project Reality technology in its future arcade titles and have signed a deal to give Nintendo exclusive home publishing rights in return for half the profits.

SONY ON THE MOVE
- Computer Trade Weekly reports that Sony's PS-X console, expected to arrive in Japan this November, is hoped to sell for less than £350. Leading developers and publishers are being given development systems early to provide enough titles on launch in Europe and the US in autumn 1995.

REAL FALL
- Virtuality, UK 3D arcade machine pioneers, has announced its first loss, of £362,000, after flotation in October. Turnover for last year was over £50 million, and the development budget has just been increased by £2 million.

OH BOY
- Systema has unveiled the TV Boy, a low-cost colour portable games system which features 126 pre-programmed games and ready to plug into TVs. Priced £39.99.

ARTS APART
- Electronic Arts has divided its American development section into EA Sports, Simulation, and Interactive Movies and Entertainment to key up background work for the changing market.

NEW EDITION
- Amstrad are returned to printers with a link-up with Swedish specialists Jarfalla ICC. Their first joint development will be an inkjet due in the summer.

- Nintendo UK are introducing a new Game Boy pack for £59.99 to replace the current £49.99 Tetris pack. Super Mario Land and Tetris will both be included in the new bundle. The stand-alone Game Boy continues for £39.99.

PRICE LESS MEGA
- Sega's portable Mega Drive, the Multi Mega, is to sell in Britain for £349 - £50 less than expected. Initial stocks will be limited, as will specialist press advertising.

C&VG REBORN AS.. C&VG
- EMAP today launches Computer and Video Games, revamped and a return of the original name after a period of just CVG. The veteran magazine has a new look and has been repositioned to cover emerging new formats.

CD FUTURE
- Future Publishing has launched CD-ROM Today to continue the Future mould, with natural cover-mounted disc. Over 45,000 copies of the magazine's first issue have been produced.

ZONE ENDS
- Future Publishing are closing Nintendo magazine Game Zone after less than a year under its ownership. ABC figures for the last half of 1993 were an 23,968 average copies sold per month.

THE CD WAY
- Paragon's Mega Power magazine is becoming much more Mega CD specific and will come with a demo disc every month.

GOOD GAME
- Findings by Dr Julie Rutkowska of Sussex University show that games encourage children's friendship and that boys spend more time playing.

   DESCRIPTION

        AmyGUI is a C++ class library for creating font sensitive 
        graphical user interfaces easily.  It contains efficient code 
        and the created sources are quite verbal and understandable.  To 
        create an executable, the library is linked with user code to a 
        standalone executable with SAS C++ V6.5x, with GCC 
        ixemul.library is needed at runtime.  

        AmyGUI makes the use of gadgets simple, e.g.  the contents of a 
        listview and a cycle gadget are manipulated in the same way, 
        although their implementation in the system is quite different.  
        With just one function call AmyGUI enables icon dropping into a 
        window.  Each time user gives input, a prenamed function in user 
        code gets called with descriptive parameters.  

        If you know C, just by looking at the demo sources included in 
        the packet, you will see why C++ is the ideal language for 
        GUIs.  
        
        Features
        
            * Font sensitivity
                - All buttons are created as if they will
                  contain a 8 pixel font, and AmyGUI
                  takes care of the rest at runtime
        
            * A window can receive an icon dropped into it, the
              enabling takes only one function call
        
            * All different types of gadgets are created in the same
              manner, only the last one or two optional parameters
              vary if needed
            
            * Dynamic menu creation and handling. Menu layout can be
              changed easily at runtime.
        
            * The strings contained in Menus, AmyListviews and
              AmyCycles can be added, inserted and deleted dynamically
              at runtime
        
            * Wide code reuse due to C++'s inheritance making the
              executable size smaller
        
            * Lots of useful classes not only for creation of GUIs
              e.g. AmyList, Dimension, Boolean, AmyPoint...
        
            * Online manual containing class reference, examples and
              hints
        

   PRICE

        AmyGUI V1.0 costs FIM 300 or USD 55.  There is a 50% discount 
        for students (send us a copy of your valid student card).  

        The prices are subject to change without notice.  Appropriate 
        postage is added on top of the price.  Bug fixes are free, but 
        the updates cost moderately.  

        Please see the packet for payment instructions.

   SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        Because AmyGUI uses BOOPSI (for now), it needs at least 
        Kickstart 2.x.

TITLE

     AXsh - Amiga external shell

VERSION

     1.31 - a non-crippled evaluation version

AUTHOR

     Pasi 'Albert' Ojala    Internet: albert@cs.tut.fi OR
                      albert@cc.tut.fi

DESCRIPTION

     AXsh's main purpose is to let other users have access to your
     Amiga and still be sure that nothing inappropriate can happen.
     AXsh ensures this by allowing access only to directories that are
     defined accessible and only accepting commands and arguments that
     are defined legal.

     AXsh supports multiple lines, multiple users logged in
     simultaneously and 8 different user levels. User actions can be
     saved into a log file. Each user has his/her own home directory,
     and the used disk space can be/is restricted.

     AXsh can be used as a bulletin board system with or without
     UUCP or as a door program in a 'normal' BBS. It has its own mail,
     news and file transfer programs. However, AXsh is not restricted
     to remote access, it can be very well used as a local shell.

     The shell itself has command line editing, function key macros,
     history, aliases, variables and scripts. It also has filename and
     commandname completion assigned to the TAB key. VT100, Ansi and
     dumb terminal modes are currently supported.

     Many useful programs are included in the packet and any CLI-based
     programs can easily be added.

     AXsh systems can be connected together to form a network, so that
     mail and news are exchanged between systems. You can also use UUCP
     instead of the native AXsh net system or you can use another
     transport mechanism like Fidonet (TrapDoor) to transfer AXsh net
     packets. News and mail programs are configurable to fully interface
     with UUCP or CNews.

     If you have WB2.1, you can choose the used language from English,
     Finnish, Spanish, French, Danish, Swedish and German. New 2.0
     features are also used, but you can still use AXsh with ks1.3 if
     you have arp.library.


NEW FEATURES

     All known security holes patched.

     Possibility to kick out users and a crude time-limit feature.

     New, faster serial handler.

     Possibility to have userlevel-specific configuration files
     for FFE and Rn (allows restricted file/news areas).

     Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

     It is now possible to install from hard disk (Assign AXshPack:
     to the directory you unarchived the InstallDisk packet).


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     arp.library (v39) OR ks2.0

     LhA (or Lx) to unpack the archive, installation disk and language
     catalogs C= Installer in the WorkBench command path to use the
     installation script (usually SYS:System/Installer)


SUGGESTED ENVIRONMENT

     A hard disk, about 1M for a basic one-user system without news

     At least 1M of memory

     A modem for remote access


HOST NAME/FILE NAME

     ftp.funet.fi:/pub/amiga/shells/AXsh/AXsh-1.31-demo.{lha,readme}

     Aminet sites, util/shell/AXshDemo131.lha


PRICE

     Suggested shareware/registration fee is US$30


DISTRIBUTABILITY

     The demo version can be freely distributed, provided that the
     contents of the archive remain intact.


IMPORTANT!

     This can be the last 1.3-compatible version. However, bugfixes will
     be done for registered users, if needed. The next version will be
     totally new inside, writing applications will be easier, the security
     will improve etc. If there is enough interest (and registrations),
     I might consider making a 1.3-compatible version also.

TITLE

    Bridal Reflections
    Framestore 3D Image Processing

RELEASE

    Volume I

AUTHORS

    Michael Jaycox, JPV
    David Tiberio, Area52

SHORT

        Bridal Reflections, Volume I, allows wedding videographers to
    create an openning and recap from saved Framestores. Using custom
    software, the original Framestores are converted into either the
    openning or recap, along with titles and a professional background.
    The videographer merely stores the desired Framestore, and our
    image processing software does the rest! In a few minutes, depending
    on the speed rating of your computer, the finished images will be
    done. The videographer may then use standard Toaster effects to
    perform transitions between the newly created Framestores. A free
    demo is available which requires Scala multimedia software, although
    256 color images are also included.

        More modules, featuring other themes, will be available in the
    future.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        This software requires the Video Toaster, and has been tested
    with Toaster 2.0 and 3.0.

PRICE

        The Bridal Reflections module and Framestore generator retails for
    $275. To order, send a check or money order for $275.00 + $2 shipping
    and handling to Area52, 6 Lodge Lane, East Setauket NY 11733.

AVAILABILITY

        Bridal Reflections will be shipping in March, 1994. Future modules
    will be announced as they become available. A demo will be made
    available on Aminet.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

        Bridal Reflections may be purchased from your local Video Toaster
    dealer. You may also order direct from Area52. Please send all
    correspondance to Area52, 6 Lodge Lane, East Setauket NY 11733.

DESCRIPTION

     ForceIcon is an utility mainly for users of CDRom drives
     or users of networking software capable of sharing devices
     and icons. Since one can not snapshot the position of a
     volume`s icon (on read only media), nor replace it by a
     user-defined one, I wrote this utility. ForceIcon allows
     you to set the position of a disk`s icon and/or replace
     it by a different image/icon which doesn`t have to be a
     disk.info file. All types of ".info" files may be selected.
     Special features include inheritance of device specific
     settings, specifying the root drawer`s size/position
     and display flags/modes.

NEW FEATURES

     - Added Server/Prefs concept. The main program comes
       with no GUI. It is controlled through an external
       Prefs editor.

     - Prefs Editor rewritten to use MUI (version 7)

     - Inheritance added. Volume entries may inherit settings
       from the corresponding device entry now.

     - Better code for scanning the DOS-List entries

     - Online Help

     - Diskchanges will be sent to all known volumes/devices
       on startup, now. This way you might be able to start
       ForceIcon from within SYS:WBStartUp

     - Added memory pool support

     - Edit entry will cause a diskchange to the volume/device
       so that you may see the changes you`ve made

     - More and better cloning of window flags

     - Added pattern support

     - Some bugfixes



SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Only OS 2.x and up
     MUI (MagicUserInterface) version 7 (MUI 2.0)

DESCRIPTION

   MUI-Builder is an application builder for MUI programs.
   It allows beginners and other programmers to build their
   graphic user interfaces very easily.

   It generates C, E or Assembly code for MUI.

   With the many options of MUI-Builder, you can generate
   precisely the part of the source code you really want, and not only the
   whole interface. This permits you to maintain easily your code
   whithout losing your previously modified program each time you
   change your interface.

   Moreover, you can design the inline hypertext guide from
   MUI-Builder by attaching a help text to each GUI-Object of your interface.
   The builder creates the AmigaGuide documentation automatically.

NEW FEATURES

   For the first time, an interface builder enables the creation of a
   catalog description file and the localized source code. With these
   features and the use of programs like Catcomp or Flexcat, localizing
   becomes really easy !!! ( I hope :-) ).

   You now can see the results of your work during the building
   of your GUI.

   - MUI 2.0 ( Won't work with MUI1.4 )
   - OS 2.x and up

DESCRIPTION

     Forth is an interactive software development environment,
     normally tailored for embedded controller and machine
     control applications.  With JForth's comprehensive Amiga
     system interface, Forth now excels at platform software
     development.   Originally created to provide precise control
     of observatory telescopes, Forth contains both an interpreter
     AND a compiler, combining the best features of both systems.
     The interpreter affords interactive access to all language
     features; programs are compiled into native 68K code.  JForth
     programs are compatible with all AMiga models and OS
     versions.  AGA support (3.1) is currently in beta test.

     This is a demo version of the JForth Professional 3.x
     software development system.  It includes a complete
     JForth interpreter/compiler which is fully-functional
     but limited in the size of executable code it will
     produce.  Also, the demo will NOT create standalone
     programs (the commercial package will).  This demo
     version also offers an "Introduction" which can be
     optionally viewed at startup.
     
     The demo interpreter/compiler includes a disassembler,
     assembler, as well as a source-level debugger.  While
     the demo package does not provide the JForth "include"
     files (similar to C's ",h" files, JForth calls them
     ".j"), MANY are pre-compiled and accessible in the demo
     program.  Similarly, the demo can also call many Amiga
     shared-library functions, as they have been pre-compiled
     for you (the demo package does NOT support adding more...
     the commercial package can call any Amiga library func-,
     tion, even custom libraries).
     
     Additionally, there is a compiled example program which
     demonstrates the JForth interface into graphics, menus,
     HAM mode, gadgets, etc.
     
     There are several source files provided, including an
     IFF file viewer, word/line counter and others (all will
     compile within the working space limitations imposed by
     the demo).  Additionally, several tutorials are provided
     for users new to Forth and/or JForth.
     
     Also provided is V1.11 of Textra, the user-friendly
     Amiga GUI-based text editor.  This is the same editor
     which accompanies the JForth package and can be
     integrated with JForth (even the demo) via ARexx.
     (Later versions of Textra are available and are
     completely backward-compatible with JForth).
     
     Finally, as an example of a JForth standalone,
     graphics-based productivity application, Mike Haas'
     1993 "LCD Calculator II" is included.

NEW FEATURES OF JFORTH PROFESSIONAL 3.x

    - Amiga DOS 2.0 includes and library support, 68040-compatible
    - ASL file requester
    - ANIM and ANIMBRUSH IFF extensions to the Picture system
    - ARexx support toolbox simplifies writing command driven

REVIEW

    The analog port is a 15-pin IBM PC style game port, so you can plug
any such stick directly.  Although the primary purpose of the Smart Port is
to provide an IBM-PC analog port, it offers many other features.  Also
included with the package are various patches for games to help with analog
support.

    Installation is easy.  Two extension cables are included which can
be freely detached from the Smart Port.  Also provided are four Velcro
patches so you can place the Smart Port in orientations other than
just lying on your desk.

    First off, it should be noted that the IBM joystick connector is
capable of supporting two analog sticks (via a Y-adaptor).  The Smart Port
passes through all the pins, but to support both sticks simultaneously it
puts one stick on mouse port number 1 and the other on mouse port number 2.
Just remember, only one input device (on each mouse port) may be used at a
time.  Also provided are pots for adjusting the X and Y axis for either
mouse port for fine tuning.  The Smart Port uses 100k potentiometres instead
of the usual capacitors.  Note that some IBM analog sticks (such as the
Flight Stick Pro, Gravis Analog Pro and Thrustmaster) with 4 independent
buttons, "view controls", and/or throttle support are really "two joysticks
in one".  The extra features (if enabled) would use the other mouse port.

    To accommodate rudder pedals, the Smart Port provides a switch that
"steals" an analog line from mouse port number 1.  If this feature is used,
if your mouse has three buttons, the third button cannot be used while the
rudder pedals are enabled.  IDD sells the rudder pedal adaptor separately.

    The Smart Port provides automatic switching between the analog
joystick(s) and the mouse ports.  To switch between devices, you simply
press the first button on the appropriate device.  Two LEDs tell you whether
the currently activated device is on the 15-pin connector or the mouse ports.

    Included with the Smart Port is SmartPortCal.  Its primary purpose
is to help with calibration of analog sticks.  It does provide a display for
the currently activated device on a given port (mouse, analog stick, or
digital stick).  For example: if you had a digital stick and pressed a
direction or button, the program would relay that back to you.

    What was most surprising was discovering the included patches for
various games:  Flight Simulator 2, F-15 Strike Eagle II, Knights of the Sky
(rudder and throttle support also), Red Baron, Gunship 2000, F-18
Interceptor, World Circuit, Birds of Prey, and others.  One of the reasons
for these patches is that a directly connected analog stick on the Amiga
(without any capacitors or potentiometres) gives a range of 0-38.  The
Smart Port on the other hand can give you the full range of 0-255.  Some
games expect the former, or weren't programmed right.  Unfortunately I could
not test any of these patches, since I don't own any of the appropriate
games.  The only game I have tested the analog mode with is Fighter Duel Pro
Flight Recorder and Fighter Duel Pro 2.  All the patches are copyrighted by
IDD and are available only to Smart Port owners.

    At the time of this writing, the Smart Port Plus is pending
release.  Differences between the first Smart Port and the new Smart Port
Plus are:

     1. Three switchable gain settings. These will allow the unit to switch
down to handle games with a hard-coded 0-40 range (low gain), DoubleNTSC
(medium), as well as the standard range (high).

     2.  A built-in "trigger" switch. When turned on, it will cause BOTH
ports to go to analog mode when your analog fire button is pressed.  This
allows you to use the mouse port in analog mode even if there is no analog
device with a "fire" button on that port.

     3. Having the multiple ranges allows me to narrow the adjustment range
of the ports slightly. It will still be a little critical, but it is a bit
easier to adjust.


DOCUMENTATION

    The supplied 15-page manual contains information on installation,
operation, adjustment of analog sticks, and troubleshooting.  Also included
are some tech notes and other notes on the software patches.  These are just
stapled pages and may have been updated since this review.

    On several occasion I have sent E-mail to the tech support.  The
response time was good and my questions were answered in detail.


BUGS

    None that I could find, hardware or software.

    However, the tech notes mention that you cannot use the Smart Port
and a Beetle Mouse simultaneously on an Amiga 500 (with stock power
supply).  The reason is that the Beetle Mouse draws too much power,


WARRANTY

    1 year.


CONCLUSIONS

    About the only missing feature on the Smart Port is a third mouse
port.  Why?  Because you still have to unplug your mouse to plug in a second
digital stick.  You could probably wire another digital stick on the 15-pin
connector, but that would exclude the use of some analog joysticks.  Other
than that, the Smart Port lives up to to its claims.  Perhaps it is a bit
pricey, but it provides full analog support, and the game patches alone may
be worthwhile to some people.

REVIEW

    The plot behind this game is basically the same as every other
shoot'em up ever released.  There's a big nasty doing big nasty things and
it's your job to stop them.  In this case, the "nasty" in question is the
Chaos Engine, a powerful machine that's gone haywire and is generally
causing a nuisance to everyone.  When you boot up the game, you get a short
animated intro explaining all this, and it's backed up by a full CD
soundtrack with narration.  Very nice indeed.  Now on to the game itself....

    When you start the game, you can select between 1 or 2 player modes.
In the 1 player mode, the second character is controlled by the computer, so
you always play this game as a team even if no humans want to play with you.
:-) At this point, you can restore an old game by entering a password, or
start a new game.  I'll talk about the password system a bit later.  When
you start a new game, you are presented with a character hiring screen.  You
start off with a certain amount of money and must hire a character to use.
There are 6 characters in all, each having individual strengths and
weaknesses (strength, speed, etc.) and special abilities.  With that done,
it's off to take on the nasties.

    The game is split into 4 worlds, each with 4 levels.  The action is
viewed from above and at an angle which lets you see the front of the
characters and nasties.  Your job is to kill as many nasties as possible and
find your way to the exit of each level.  Before you can get out, though, you must activate "nodes" that are scattered around the levels.  These are
tower-like things, and you activate them by just shooting them.  Once you've
activated all the nodes, the exit (or exits) will open.  On most levels,
there's actually more than one exit, and each one will cause you to start
from a different place on the next level.

    When you shoot a nasty, it'll leave behind a coin which you can pick
up and add to your bank balance.  There are also coins laying around on the
ground to be picked up.  Other things you can pick up include:  weapon
power-ups, keys that open doors and secret passages, food (for restoring
energy), extra lives, etc. etc.  There's more than one way of finishing most
levels; in fact, there are often alternate routes which lead you to heaps of
bonuses (and usually a swarm of nasties as well)! :-(

    At the end of every 2 levels, you are taken to the Shop screen.  Here
you can buy all sorts of goodies to improve your characters' performance.
Things you can buy include: health, speed, weapon power-ups, lives, special
weapons, and more.

    The end of the last level takes you to a showdown with the Chaos
Engine. (Surprise, surprise. :-))

    When your game ends, you are given a password which allows you to
restart at the beginning of the world that you were up to.  The way this
password works is bit different from other games, and it is great.  When you
restart with a password, you start at the shop screen with the total amount
of money that you had collected during the last game.  You can then re-buy
all your weapons etc. or choose to buy something else instead.  This is
great because you can try different tactics:  for instance, starting with
heaps of lives, or starting with MEGA guns. :-)


DOCUMENTATION

    The CD sleeve contains a brief introduction to the game.  Full
instructions are provided on the CD in English, French, German and Italian.
They are very nicely presented as a series of pages which you flip through
with the controller.


LIKES

    Superb gameplay.  This game just feels great!  This is a game which
has been thoroughly play-tested, I simply cannot fault it in terms of
playability.

    The password system is the best I've ever seen.

    The 2 players' characters can walk through one another.  While this
isn't exactly realistic, it does make the game more playable.

    The background graphics are excellent.  They have enough detail to
make them interesting, but not enough to make it difficult to see what's
going on.  The sprites are nice and colourful. The 6 player sprites look
great, they're really well drawn and each have their unique character.
Also, the introduction animation is quite good (although short).

    The CD music tracks on the title and between-level screens are
fabulous.  Also, the CD sound effects during the game are very well done and
add lot of atmosphere.  Music in the game itself is Amiga-based, but is
still very atmospheric because it changes depending on where you are in the
level.  For instance, as you approach the exit the music builds up to make
it a bit more tense.  Sound effects are also excellent.  The nasties have
all sorts of weird (but appropriate) noises, and there's a bit of speech
too.

    Basically, the overall look and feel of this game is superb.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

    The action does slow down noticeably when there are a lot of objects
on screen.  This suggests to me that the programmers have just added the new
AGA graphics to the code from the Amiga version, instead of re-writing it
for 68020/AGA.  I expect that adding some Fast RAM would help, as would
running the game on the A4000 CD32 add-on.  As neither of these exist right
now, I can't try them, but I assume the game will make use of extra speed
because the Amiga version did.

    The game doesn't use the full PAL screen.  PAL users can force it
into NTSC using the boot-menu though, and it then fills the screen.


BUGS

    The game occasionally freezes for an instant.  I think it might be
when it's changing CD tracks.  This does not affect gameplay at all though:
it's hardly noticeable.


VENDOR SUPPORT

    An address is provided for support, but unfortunately not a phone
number.  I have not needed to contact them as yet.


WARRANTY

    Unknown.


CONCLUSIONS

    In my opinion, this is one of the CD32's best games to date.  I
already had the Amiga version, but for me the CD32 version was still a
must-have, even though it has no extra levels.  If you're a CD32 owner who
hasn't played the original Amiga version, then get this game!  If you had the
original Amiga version, then get this game anyway!  A lot of people whinge
about CD32 games which are ports of Amiga titles, but I'm not complaining
when the games are this good.  The Bitmap Brothers have taken a classic
Amiga game, enhanced the graphics/sound, and produced a classic CD32 game.

    I'd give it about 90%, and a bit more if it didn't slow down.

Thanks for all of you who responded to our first issue - it's great to know that people worldwide are interested in what we are writing, so we thank you for taking the time to contact us.

Unfortunately we cannot get Amiga Newsbits to you by e-mail yet and it looks unlikely that this will happen in the short term unless somebody approaches us with an offer of help. So you'll have to call one of our
distribution sites or pick it up from Aminet a couple of days after release.

Many thanks also to David Tiberio who has offered us the use of his Installer script which he has also supplied to Amiga Report. If you can't get to grips with tooltypes to pick Amigaguide reader to call, this will help. A big thanks, David!

Hot news is from the @{" European Computer Trade Show " link FeatECTS} where the CD1200 drive was previewed along with the A4000T - but why does it only have a 25MHz 040 and not 33MHz? At nearly 2,000 pounds it is stepping away from the PC market, not showing fierce competition.

The other big issue at the moment is word that Commodore has been bought up by Hewlett Packard or Sony. On CIX here in the UK, net messages suggested that $15 million of shares at about $0.75 a piece had been bought, giving Sony control, while others say there is not a shread of evidence in favour of this and that CBM shares have stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Whatever has happened, those in control and keeping very quiet. We'll just have to wait and see!

Finally, apologies for late arrival. About an hour before this issue was expected ready my hard disk crashed. Only a tenth of the file remained and I had to recover what I could by hand.

Stay well all!

    @{b}CD32 BITS @{ub}- COMPLETE VIDEO EXPERIENCE!


Full Motion Video is without a doubt the most exciting thing to hit the home computer market in years. MPEG encoding techniques enable 74 minutes of digital footage and soundtrack to be pressed onto a single CD.

The CD32 FMV add-on module was released in the first week of January but before more than a handful were aware, Commodore recalled all of the units due to inherent problems. These have only recently been re-released.

I was one of the lucky few who managed to purchase one before they were withdrawn and as far as I can see there are no major problems with it.
The rumour was that once installed the CD32 was unable to read discs,
but this seems unfounded, because mine works perfectly.

The initial release date was delayed, because Philips had signed a deal
with Paramount meaning that the first 50 movies released would only
work with the CD-i Digital Video expansion - obviously a market ploy on their part for shifting a few machines.

Commodore apparently re-worked the module with CD-i code included and I can confirm that all of the presently available CD-i "only" movie titles work perfectly with the CD32 FMV module.

Right, the facts! Installation of the unit could not be simpler.  Just unscrew the back plate of the CD32, push the module into the slot provided and screw it in. You can now discard the original back plate, because you will never need it again. [he hopes - Ed.]

The unit, when fitted correctly, sticks out of the back of the CD32 by about 1cm, but this is no problem. If you connect a mouse, and hold down both buttons, you will be presented with the boot options screen. Click on Expansion Board Diagnostics and you will be told the board is present and working.

Now the exciting bit - watching your first Video CD!

Unfortunately there was no CD supplied with the original units but
hopefully Commodore will get round to doing this. A music video compilation would be a good idea.

However if when you bought your CD32 you received the Dangerous Streets/Wing Commander disc, there is a small FMV demonstration, of the CD32 television advert shown over Christmas, which shouldn't hold your attention for too long.

Your next move is to go out and buy your first Video CD. Top Gun is one of the better titles available at the moment. Just load the CD in the normal way and wait.

After about ten seconds you will be presented with a menu screen. On all of the movies, there are only two choices: either view the copyright warning or the film.

On the CD-i, you can jump to specified parts of the film, which are indexed in the CD sleeve, but this is not implemented on my, early version, of the CD32 module.

Selecting PLAY on the controller starts the film and then all
is to pump up the volume and sit back.

The film can be fast forwarded by holding down the relevant button and a single tap of the button will advance the film 5 minutes. It can also be rewound in the same way.

Pressing PAUSE results in a rock steady frame, which could be easily grabbed with no loss at all. Once paused, you can advance the frames one by one, or play the film in slow-motion. It is not possible however to play the film in slow-motion reverse.

Another button gives a display of where you are in the CD, plus the
sound can be muted, and switched between the first, and second channels.

The picture quality if far better than that of VHS tapes, with the added advantage of the CD's not suffering from deterioration. The films are
best watched when the CD32 is connected to a TV, because slight pixelation is apparent when run through a monitor.

If you stare hard enough, you can sometimes see the frames jump, but I would suspect that this is purely down to the CD encoding. Rest assured, it will not spoil your viewing.

As far as I see, the FMV Module for the CD32 is one of the best computer
product that you can get.  It is not overly expensive (£199) and nor
are the CDs (£15).

If you have a CD32, I recommend to get the FMV module - it is absolutely amazing!

    @{b}EUROPEAN COMPUTER TRADE SHOW@{ub}

    - London, April 10-12


Our "top" "reporting" "team" split themselves over the first two days of the show, all first-timers and enjoying it immensely, while getting down to proper work at the same time.

Part of the good thing about the trade show is that there is less noise than consumer shows, although it's still fairly crowded especially around the food areas. Companies were spread across a mix of suites and stands, some just offering hospitality to programmers and retailers, others deciding to actively demonstrate their projects, such as Silicon Graphics.

Sega were previewing Virtua Racing on the Mega Drive, as well as giving free play on a couple of the real arcade machines. The conversion has lost a lot of the detail and colour which helped with the realism, but the speed is captured nearly just as well. You wouldn't be disappointed with this for a 16-bit machine. Can we have an Amiga version please?

Philips had a large stand and were pushing CD-i. Despite its technical inferiority to all other CD consoles around (expect maybe the Mega CD), demonstration units were concentrating on what CD-i is doing very well with - FMV.

Among the displays were Microcosm, Voyeur, Mad Dog McCree and Peter Gabriel's Xplora interactive music CD. Philips are very keen to push CD-i at its late stage in life, predicting that a million will be in homes worldwide by the year end, and it's quite possible they will do it. With a new bundle including the FMV module and the television colours offered by MPEG, many people will see it as being one of the more advanced machines. More FMV games are needed for the CD32 - quick!

Commodore were fairly hidden away, although not any more than Sega and Nintendo. In a sub-corner of their room was the CD1200 drive. Imagine half a CD32 coloured the A1200 shade of white for an idea of what it looks like.

It was on the audio select screen and playing some jazz. Tracks could be selected by moving the mouse. The black controller of the CD32 was also attached. The CD1200 connects to the A1200's trapdoor expansion slot via a cable running through the hole in the back of the machines. Commodore UK say they are currently looking at options for a British launch. Rumours also suggest that Canada may be one of the first places for its emergence (!) - but anything could happen in the next six months.

Along one wall, several of the main Amiga third-party supporters were demonstrating products including Lightwave and Emplant. The A4000 Tower was also standing on this wall. It has a very distinctive look and also appears to measure several feet from front to back.

Other highlights included Sony DADC were showing off results of their new printing techniques putting photographic quality pictures on the top of compact discs, Ocean were running previews of Digital Image Design's Inferno, and there were the several standard people in furry, cute costumes wandering around - generally ignored - who should have been pushed down the stairs for fun.

Expect us back in the autumn, when we may attempt to find out what cries of panic these creatures make when falling!

    @{b}AMIGA NEWSBITS INSTALLER@{ub}

After our first issue, active Amiga and net user @{b}David Tiberio@{ub} contacted us to suggest that we could make life easier for Workbench 2/3 owners by including a Installer script. Good idea! He had even written one, so even better!

Just like other Installer scripts, it simple to use. Click on the icons and follow the instructions to pick the Amigaguide reader you use - Amigaguide on Workbench 2 and Multiview on Workbench 2.1 and 3. One will be found in the Sys:Utilities/ drawer.

Vast instructions aren't needed - if they were you probably wouldn't have got to this stage.

You may have noticed that the the same script comes with Amiga Report. We congratulate David for using his talents to help all readers in the Amiga community.

    @{b}WRITE FOR US!@{ub}

So, do you like Amiga Newsbits? How about writing a page or two for us? We pay the lowest rates in the business (ie nothing) and put your name in positive pixels.

Lined up for coming weeks are more CD32 reviews, a look at Xenolink 1.90 BBS software which is finally ready, programming advice and a guide to getting your Amiga on the internet.

There's plenty more you Amiga owners are doing out there, so tell everyone about it. Anything on any Amiga-related topic is welcome - a scope as big as the Amiga's possibilities and your imagination.

We're also in other countries to provide details of Amiga happenings and
show reports. Letters are welcome and a mini classified sales section is under consideration - watch for details.

Let us know what you want - we can, quite probably, supply!
