<P ALIGN="LEFT">It is often said, "The times...they are a'changin'." We Amiga users can certainly identify with that.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Back in March, we had to really begin to wonder if the Amiga had any future left at all. Then, all of a sudden, out of the blue comes Gateway 2000. If nothing else, Amiga keyboards the world over were as busy as ever for a time (and in fact probably still are). It may seem hard to believe, but it's been over two months since The Announcement.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">At this point, I'm glad to be able to say that the acquisition has been finalized. Also interesting is the press conference held by Amiga International on May 16. While we can't really be sure exactly what to expect yet, it seems that Gateway 2000 and Amiga International do intend to continue developing the Amiga as a personal computer platform. This ongoing saga will probably play out further in the coming months, and we may soon have a more definite idea of the nature of the Amiga's immediate future.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now on to this issue of AM. Unfortunately, we're still running a bit behind after that really awful month (awful at least time-wise), but we're a few days ahead of last month, and should be able to bump the publication date back even further for June. In the meantime, we've had to forego a few items and articles in order to keep on schedule. My apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">We <I>do</I> have a few things of particular interest this month. Steve Duff, the new owner of an A4000T (his first Amiga), is back to finish his story on the trials and tribulations, as well as great rewards, of becoming an Amiga user, and we have some rather, well, shall I say "offbeat" anonymous material as well, to name a few. But that will be all from this editor for now, so I'll see you here again next month. Farewell for now.</P>

<A HREF="solaria.htm">Digital Frontiers</A><BR>
<B><I>By Kyle Webb</I></B><BR>
Are we at risk of losing our own sense of human identity in the rising tide of information and technology? The Digital Age has brought us many great things, but it has also brought its share of problems. We must learn to keep everything in perspective if we are to maintain a measure of integrity as a society.

<B><I>By Sam Ormes</I></B><BR>
In these very interesting Amiga times, the questions are many and manifold, but what is usually one of the biggest questions in such a situation oddly remains largely unasked, as Sam Ormes relates here.

<A HREF="amigan.htm">Becoming An Amigan: The Trail of Tears</A><BR>
<B><I>By Steve Duff</I></B><BR>
Steve Duff returns this month to conclude his story of Becoming an Amigan, with a fascinating tale of not only discoveries, but also problems, difficulties, and struggles, and further, the rewards of staying with it through it all...but also a warning of how things must change in the way the Amiga is brought to market, if it is to survive in the world of modern computing.<BR>
