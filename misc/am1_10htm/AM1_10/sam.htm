<P ALIGN="LEFT">Many really big questions remain to be answered. Like why did Gateway really buy our Amiga and what do they intend to do with it? So overwhelming are these concerns that we seem to have forgotten a question that used to be THE question in times past....... What did they pay for it?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">During the auction of Commodore assets in New York back in 1995, the numbers received all the attention. Remember the Dell deposit of US$ one million (or was it two?) that was rejected? Do you recall the conjecture over the Escom bid...10 or 12 or 15 million? If you could talk numbers back then, you really knew what was going on in the Amiga world.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Following the Escom collapse, when the remains were once again put on the market, a chap named Hembach placed a price tag on the Amiga of 40 million and we waited to see who would come up with that enormous amount of money. Many were fooled by VIScorp's pretentions, but the German liquidator wouldn't accept Monopoly money. We then pinned our hopes on QuikPak but whatever offer they made apparently wasn't enough.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Out of the blue came Gateway, a company with very deep pockets. They bid on it, their bid was accepted, and they now own it lock, stock, and barrel. Amazingly, nobody is asking that old question...... What did it sell for?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Price check please.</P>
