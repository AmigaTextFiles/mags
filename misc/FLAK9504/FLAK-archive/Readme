Welcome to the July issue of the GAC FLAK!

This issue uses only fonts from the PageStream2 and 3 releases with the
exception of HelvNrw-BoldItalic (which came with later versions of
PageStream3 but which some of you might not have. It is available from
Soft-Logik Publishing for a nominal fee.) and Futurist-BoldItalic which
is from the Keyfonts for Macintosh collection (I got it at Office Depot).

I decided to subdivide the archive into PageStream2 and 3 directories so
that it would be easier to tell which documents were from which version.

There is much info about the ESCOM news conference, taken mainly from the
AmigaTech.lha archive on AmiNET/docs/misc. There is also a missing person
report that *MAY* have been solved already. Finally there is an insert
that, if done correctly will have the ShowIssueCvrArt.PgS3 on one side
and President'sCornerJun95 on the other. ShowIssueCvrArt.PgS3 mentions
the new graphics format PNG as well as the more obvious.
