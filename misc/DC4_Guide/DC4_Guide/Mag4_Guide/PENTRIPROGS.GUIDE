@{"b"}PentriSoft Programs@{"ub"}

Here are a list of programs and other productions by PentriSoft members... They are sorted into 2 categories.

@{"Firstly" link PDPROGS}, those which are Public Domain, and can be obtained from the places listed (eg, PD libraries, Aminet, etc), although there may be the author's address given, and:

@{"Secondly" link AUTHORPROGS}, those which have to be purchased from the author's contact address given.

@{"b"}Notes:@{"ub"}

This list itself is freely distributable, but must NOT be altered in anyway without my written permission.

For those productions which you have to get direct from the author, make sure you check any specific considerations (currency, cheques, etc), state clearly what you want, and of course make sure you write to the right one! These addresses are those of the authors, and not PD libraries. If you are sending cash, make sure it isn't obvious that there is some money in the envelope!

In all cases, the copyright belongs with the authors of the software. Please see the software/documentation for more specific information.

We cannot guarantee the system requirements, as we cannot test our products on all machines, but the given requirements *should* be okay.

This document, to the best of my knowledge, is correct as of 2nd April, 1997, but I cannot be held responsible for any errors or omissions.
