@{"b"}Why Teachers Never Smiled in 1915!@{"ub"} 
 
For generations, school children have waved their hands frantically in the 
air,   trying  to  attract the teachers attention with the  cry,   "Please 
Miss!". 
 
But  children of today may not be aware of why female school teachers  are 
always referred to as Miss, instead of Mrs. 
 
Over  the years,  all young ladies strove to be was school teachers,   but 
they had to be unmarried - hence the Miss. 
 
The  job  was so strict and severe,  it is a wonder so many of the females 
stayed single to remain in the teaching profession.  We should be indebted 
to  the  Schools  Museum in Scotland Street,  Glasgow for  supplying  this 
data,   and  my local newspaper,  the Largs & Millport Weekly  News,   for 
printing this article: 
 
 
                         Rules for Teachers in 1915:- 
 
1.	You will @{"b"}NOT@{"ub"} marry during the terms of your contract. 
2.	You are @{"b"}NOT@{"ub"} to keep company with men. 
3.	You @{"b"}MUST@{"ub"} be home between the hours of 8pm and 6am unless attending
