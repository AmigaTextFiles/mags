@{"b"}Doubleclick Issue 4 Editorial@{"ub"}  

Dear Readers,  

Well here we are again, another edition of the magazine you just can't seem to put down.  Already into it's fourth issue, and getting bigger and better all the time.  

Not bad considering my Hard Drive crashed, much to my disgust.  Still, lucky me had backed most of it up.  Now you know why I want a Zip drive!  Anybody with a weak heart for a sob story, and of course loads of wad, should write to me, enclosing their money.  I will of course send them a disk of stuff to acknowledge the fact you are supporting me.  

Anyway, that's the end of the appeal slot - on with the mag.  

Recent developments in the Amiga world, have met the public with some joyful remarks.  Amiga Format are going loopy over the new Tower Power Amiga combo, and advertised on practically every back cover of Amiga magazines (well, the only two left at the moment.), is the PC Amiga Network, which allows Amiga users to transfer files with lesser mortals.  

The World Of Amiga show last month looks like it has been a huge sucess, both for the public and traders alike.  One more rung in the ladder is climbed until we are taken seriously again.  
	----------------------------------------
  I must say that I am sorry to see the end of Amiga User International.  When I heard it was to end, after many years of publication, and many name changes, I had a tear in my eye.  Although I was not instrumental in their downfall by not having a subscription, which I always planned to do, I bought nearly every issue.  The Superdisks were just fantastic, even though most of the stuff was also on every other magazine at the same time.  They seemed to be able to cram just about everything you could want onto the disks, with the right balance of software.  
	----------------------------------------
  Have you noticed that everywhere you go, people are infactuated with these Virtual Pets?  These electronic vermin, which must be fed, taken for walks, and generally fussed over are taking over peoples lives. How long is it before somebody runs somebody down in their car, and in the following court case, pleads innocence as he was trying to put his virtual cat, dog, or even hamster to sleep?  
	----------------------------------------
  Hold onto your hats folks!  Are you sick of Windoze 3.1/'95....etc?  You had better watch out because Big Billy and his team of techno wizards have decided that Windows 95 is looking dated now, and they have ordered a change in appearance.  The new Windows 97, which at the moment is being developed under a secret codename (Memphis - although I didn't tell you), will not be released until the end of the year. Microsoft could not hold back their joy, though, when they arranged a sneak preview of things to come 97 style for the world's press.  

Their Web Browser, called Internet Explorer 4, which I think is more apt on the side of a space shuttle, as usual has rewritten the rules, and god forbid you if you do not stick by them.  This is Bill Gates talking, and you must listen.  

You install IE4 onto the offending PC, and Windows 95 takes on a  whole new lease of life.  You are presented with what effectively looks like a Web Browser (Wooppee!).  Favourite pages can be stored for easy loading. Unfortunately, most of the changes are in the backroom, which you don't see.  If you are running an ISDN line or a permanent connection, you will notice a difference.  If, like most of civilisation, you are connected via a provider, you will find that thinks go a bit pear shaped.  Phone bills will no doubt hike up as the computer chats on the phone all day.  This of course is no problem to our US counterparts, who don't pay for local telephone calls anyway. How lucky they are.  If only BT could give us the same deal.  
	----------------------------------------
  Notice in the latest edition of Amiga Format, and editorial review about a new CD Rom bundle from Power Computing.  They are giving away, literally, loads of software, when you buy a CD Rom from them.  The dual speed one, with Personal Suite, Wordworth 6, Chaos Engine, and Diggers, is only just under £100.  Can't be bad.  Let's face it - a dual speed is fast enough.  I could see the point if you were downloading CD's across the 'Net, but not everybody is that amazingly rich to be able to perfom such a task.   

I shall be saving up my pennies and purchase such a drive very soon.  

Did I also say that you get the Squirrel as well.  Now you know it's a great deal.  Today the CD Rom, tommorrow the Zip Drive.  
	----------------------------------------
  As for the mag (about time I talked about it), there should be a few changes this issue.  I have drawn a few piccys for the mag, with a bit of help from Mark (Thanks for the Logo).  One is a nice VistaPro landscape with a Doubleclick logo rendered with Imagine.  I don't know about the logo, but the landscape only took about 10 minutes to make, although I have reduced the colours (but not the quality) to 256, so it would not take up too much room, seeing as it was an IFF-24 beforehand.  

Also, there is a special offer on for Issue 5, where we will be giving away a free gift, although the price of the magazine will be raised to cover the cost.  All details will be included in the picture, assuming Mark uses it (pppllleeeaaassseee Mark).  

Also there is a nice address page, so you know who to write to, as well as a few nice loading screens and of course the obligatory loading animations.  

I have also designed two more pages, just as I was writing this document. Ideas just pop into my head.  
	----------------------------------------
  I am looking to expand my network of Penpals I have all over the world.  If anybody in the USA or Australia is reading this, then I would be VERY interested in hearing from you.  I am also looking for contacts in Europe, although they must be able to speak, or at least write English.  I can understand some French, and maybe some German, but English will guarantee you a MUCH faster reply.  I reply 1200%, and produce a monthly cat disk of all the PD software that I own, and I am willing to swap anything you like, but I am at the moment mostly interested in Art (Pictures, Clipart & Slideshows).  

Please write with your details to the address at the top of the page, or find my name and address in the Addresses Page (If Mark has used it (Hint Hint, Mark)).  

Also, please load the monthly Guide document that I produce every month, listing ALL the PD & Shareware I own.  It is updated monthly, and also gives details of other penpals I have.  How would you like to be added to list?  I would also appreciate if you could return the questionnaire in the Guide to myself, as this will ensure that you get regular updates from me directly, even if you don't buy Doubleclick! (Although I would stress that you should).  It has gone through quite a major tidy up and I have reworked some of the sections, to make it easier to navigate around the guide.  Quite a lot of work considering that the document take up around 150K before I have to crunch it.  At the last count it had 4,924 lines and 25,483 words!  
	----------------------------------------
  Well, time to go, as this document is taking up valuable disk space. You want to read the rest of the magazine anyway, as it will keep you occupied for hours (especially the articles written by me!).  One last thing before I go. We are very interested in what you want in the magazine. You are buying it, after all, so it should be YOUR magazine. Give us your views and tell us what you want, be it more articles, free software (games and utilities), or whatever. Would you be prepared to pay a little bit extra for more disks (maybe 3) which would include all the free software, or would you be interested in sending away for it via mail, from me? Write to either myself or Mark Harman with your views. Our addresses are at the top of our Editorials, or the @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/SONIC_ADDRESSES.PNG/MAIN"} Addresses screen (If Mark uses it!).  

Thanks for watching.  See you in Issue 5.
