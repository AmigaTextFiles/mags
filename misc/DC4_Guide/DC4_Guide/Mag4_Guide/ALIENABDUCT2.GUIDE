Firstly, although this is kind of 'Part Two', it doesn't necessarily follow on from last issue's article, and I may repeat  myself, but never mind.  

Research on abductions has revealed many common experiences, which can be arranged into groups:  

Common experiences, those such as tissue sample taking, implanting devices into abductees, sexual arousal, egg/sperm collection, implanting embryos and extracting fetuses. Abductess usually experience all of these in an abduction. The implants' purpose is unknown. Abductees have reported finding mtiny metallic balls, expelled when they sneeze for example. The few that have been sent for testing have revealed nothing about their origin. Egg/sperm collection seems undoubtably for the human offspring that are also seen in abductions, although what happens  to them after childhood is unknown.  

Those experiences which are less frequent, and usually only some of these will an abductee undergo in any one abduction. They include sessions where the aliens present images and films to the  abductee, to watch their response. There may be a sexual element to these images, such as a fantasy with a person the abductee is attracted to, or there may be scenes of war, for example. The subject may also be asked to imagine object in his or her mind. They may also be shown some children - the alien/human hybrids or, more likely, genetically altered humans.  

Then there are the experiences which an individual abductee will only very occasionally experience. Some have reported seeing  pools, which they are led into and under the surface, yet they are still able to breathe. Sometimes, they are cured of illnesses or injuries - although it seems that this is not the purpose of the abduction itself, just something the aliens do. Some abductees seem to have been 'giving' information, somehow implanted in to them rather than told in the usual sense. They have displayed knowledge on scientific subjects that they have never studied.  

Of course, that is only a brief summary of the many event which may take place in a typical abduction - maybe I will go into them further in future issues.  
	----------------------------------------
 @{"b"}Entering the UFO@{"ub"}. Alien abductions are sometimes associated with UFO sightings, although a UFO does not have to be  sighted. Many abductions occur when the abductee is asleep in bed. They recall lights appearing through the window, and seeing aliens. They are taken by levitation, seemlingly passing straight  through walls and windows.  

As with the rest of the encounter, abductees are usually unable to remember this without hypnosis, but they are more likely to remember the beginning and end of an abduction. A possibility is that the subject recalls the start of an abduction, and then manages to fight it off. Under hypnosis, they  recall that an abduction did take place, they just remembered the start and end of it.  

Considering explanations to the abduction experience other than it being aliens, I believe some sort of psychological explanation most likely (I cannot believe that they are all just making it up). The beginning of an abduction gives most clues to this; tests have shown that by stimulating some parts of the brain, a 'floating' experiece can be induced, which can be quite frightening, just like in an abduction.  

More interesting is how all through history there have been myths of people being taken from their beds at night, from demons  to bogeymen... maybe aliens is just another interpretation of something psychological?  

Well, that's enough for now. See you next iss.
