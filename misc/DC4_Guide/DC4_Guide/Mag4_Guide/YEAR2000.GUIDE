@{"b"}Year 2000 to cost businesses dearly@{"ub"}  

Businesses  in the UK will have to pay out £31 BILLION,  as they  approach the year 2000, it was revealed yesterday.  

The massive figure,  revealed by top Gorvernment advisors - is three times bigger than had been estimated previously.  

The  problem is that thousands of computers,  ranging from PC's in offices and banks to computers that control traffic lights and the NHS, are unable to  differentiate between the year 1900 and 2000.  They tell the  year  by the last two digits of the year,  so after 1999,  the computer thinks that it is 1900, instead of 2000.  

January 1,  1900 fell on a Monday,  but January 1,  2000 will  fall  on  a Saturday.   This  means that bank vaults could open  on  the  wrong  days, traffic  lights  will   run   weekend   programming   instead  of  weekday programming, complex systems that backup data via phone lines will back up data on the wrong days etc.  

30,000  extra  Information Technolgy workers will need to be  employed  to cover the mammoth task of reprogramming computers.  

Robin  Guenier,   who is the head of Taskforce 2000,  a Government  funded programme has admitted that the problem will not be fixed in time for  the year 2000.  

He  said:  "Imagine all these computers which control everything from  DSS payments  to nuclear power stations going wrong.  It doesn't  just  affect big  businesses,  as it will also affect millions of ordinary people.   It could mean workers not getting paid,  the unenployed not getting benefits, the ill not getting the right prescriptions,  and hundreds of thousands of businesses will need new computers.".  

Some  big companies are already taking steps into their own hands.  BT  is thought to be spending around £300 million on its complex computer system, and  Barclays Bank and the NatWest are thought to be spending  about  £100 million each.  

Of  course,  Amiga users don't have to worry,  as our computers are better than  computers from the "Itsy Bitsy Machine" company,  and their inferior "Pretty  Crap"  computer,  or even AppleMacs - you  must  have  heard  the saying,   "Machine Always Crashes,  If Not The Operating  System  Hangs!". Sorry about that Stephane, but I was told this by a penpal in Norway, Ragnar Fyri.
