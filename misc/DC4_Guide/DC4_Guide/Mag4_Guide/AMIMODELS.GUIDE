@{"b"}Amiga Models@{"ub"}  

Here is a list of the current Amiga range, modified from last issue's, and looking more optimistic. Possible future Models are listed here also.  

@{"b"}Name@{"ub"}:A1200
@{"b"}Manufacturer@{"ub"}:Was Escom, but there must be loads hanging around in stock going at rip off prices...
@{"b"}Released@{"ub"}:According to Escom, 1995. For everyone else, 1992.
@{"b"}Current Price@{"ub"}:£400 (can be as 'low' as £370)
@{"b"}CPU@{"ub"}:68020 @ 14MHz (cough)
@{"b"}Ram@{"ub"}:2MB Chip, No Fast, No SIMMs
@{"b"}Gfx, etc@{"ub"}:AGA
@{"b"}Other Specs@{"ub"}:OS3.1; PCMCIA, Trapdoor expansions

Released at £400, it was considered bad value for money, despite the Amiga Magic Pack. 18 months on, £400 has got to be a joke.  

@{"b"}Name@{"ub"}:A1200HD
@{"b"}Manufacturer@{"ub"}:Escom
@{"b"}Released@{"ub"}:1992/1995
@{"b"}Current Price@{"ub"}:£500 (most places about £470)
@{"b"}CPU@{"ub"}:68020 @ 14MHz
@{"b"}Ram@{"ub"}:2MB
@{"b"}Gfx, etc@{"ub"}:AGA
@{"b"}Other Specs@{"ub"}:As A1200, but with 170MB IDE Hard Drive

Even worse affected by the passage of time; in mid-1995, an extra £100 for a 170MB HD was good value, but not now. It does have Scala, though.  

@{"b"}Name@{"ub"}:A1200TE
@{"b"}Manufacturer@{"ub"}:Eagle
@{"b"}Released@{"ub"}:1996
@{"b"}Current Price@{"ub"}:£600 for '020; £800 for '040; £1000 for '060
@{"b"}CPU@{"ub"}:68020 @ 14MHz; 68040 @ 40MHz; 68060 @ 50MHz
@{"b"}Ram@{"ub"}:2MB Chip
@{"b"}Gfx, etc@{"ub"}:AGA
@{"b"}Other Specs@{"ub"}:Tower with Zorro slots

To be honest, I don't know how many slots it has, or whether there are any SIMM slots, but it's probably the cheapest way to get a Tower equipped Amiga (without DIY). Or you could buy a...  

@{"b"}Name@{"ub"}:PowerAmiga
@{"b"}Manufacturer@{"ub"}:Direct
@{"b"}Released@{"ub"}:1997
@{"b"}Current Price@{"ub"}:£1500
@{"b"}CPU@{"ub"}:68060 @ 50MHz
@{"b"}Ram@{"ub"}:2MB Chip, 16MB Fast, 4MB Video
@{"b"}Gfx, etc@{"ub"}:4MB 64bit PicassoIV card (and AGA)
@{"b"}Other Specs@{"ub"}:Tower (Zorro slots), IDE, 1GB Hard Drive, CD ROM, Monitor

The best miggy currently here, surely! They will also offer to upgrade your A1200 to the specification. This machine surely makes all the following (A4000, etc) obselete for all but perhaps video purposes, due to them being more expensive, and not as good.  

@{"b"}Name@{"ub"}:A4000TE
@{"b"}Manufacturer@{"ub"}:Eagle
@{"b"}Released@{"ub"}:1996
@{"b"}Current Price@{"ub"}:£1800 for '040; £2000 for '060
@{"b"}CPU@{"ub"}:68040 @ 40MHz; 68060 @ 50MHz
@{"b"}Ram@{"ub"}:2MB Chip, 4MB Fast
@{"b"}Gfx, etc@{"ub"}:AGA
@{"b"}Other Specs@{"ub"}:Tower, SCSI & IDE, 1GB SCSI Hard Drive

There is also a 'bare bones' version which costs £1300, but has no hard drive or CPU. I could mention the AT/Escom A4000Ts, but they are not as good value (ie, awful value).  

@{"b"}Name@{"ub"}:Draco
@{"b"}Manufacturer@{"ub"}:MacroSystems
@{"b"}Released@{"ub"}:1995
@{"b"}Current Price@{"ub"}:£2000+ for '040; £3000+ for '060 (approx)
@{"b"}CPU@{"ub"}:68040 @ 25MHz; 68060 @ 50MHz
@{"b"}Ram@{"ub"}:16MB
@{"b"}Gfx, etc@{"ub"}:Graphics, video and sound cards
@{"b"}Other Specs@{"ub"}:Tower with Zorro and Draco slots, SCSI Hard Drive, 4x CD ROM, Option for Alpha AXP coprocessor

Despite what some may think, this is an Amiga, and is a viable alternative to the A4000T for video work.

	----------------------------------------
  

Now for some possible future Amigas, in probable chronolgical order. Get out your crystal balls now...  

@{"b"}Name@{"ub"}:PowerAmiga 'Mark 2'
@{"b"}Manufacturer@{"ub"}:Direct
@{"b"}Released@{"ub"}:1997 Very Shorty?
@{"b"}Current Price@{"ub"}:£1000-£2000 range?
@{"b"}CPU@{"ub"}:603/604
@{"b"}Ram@{"ub"}:2MB Chip, 16MB Fast, 4MB Video
@{"b"}Gfx, etc@{"ub"}:4MB 64bit Picasso IV graphics card (and AGA)
@{"b"}Other Specs@{"ub"}:Tower (Zorro slots), IDE, 1GB Hard Drive, CD ROM, Monitor
	If I had £1500 or so to spend on a computer shortly (I wish...), I know what I would buy...


@{"b"}Name@{"ub"}:PIOS ONE TransAM system
@{"b"}Manufacturer@{"ub"}:PIOS
@{"b"}Released@{"ub"}:May/June 1997?
@{"b"}Current Price@{"ub"}:£1978?
@{"b"}CPU@{"ub"}:60 - 'Faster than a Pentium MMX' - 3 @ 200MHz
@{"b"}Ram@{"ub"}:16MB RAM, 2MB Video
@{"b"}Gfx, etc@{"ub"}:2MB 64bit Trio64 S3 PCI graphics card
@{"b"}Other Specs@{"ub"}:PCI, ISA slots, 2.1GB IDE Hard drive, 8x IDE CD ROM, SCSI.




@{"b"}Name@{"ub"}:A\Box
@{"b"}Manufacturer@{"ub"}:Phase 5
@{"b"}Released@{"ub"}:Early 1998???
@{"b"}Current Price@{"ub"}:£1300?
@{"b"}CPU@{"ub"}:603 @ 150MHz? (&604 versions)
@{"b"}Ram@{"ub"}:16MB (Unified RAM access)
@{"b"}Gfx, etc@{"ub"}:Caipirinha - wow
@{"b"}Other Specs@{"ub"}:SCSI Hard disk and CD ROM, PCI slots, 2 video in/out genlock capable, loadsa sound channels, modem, IEEE FireWire, Built in kettle.

A long time to wait maybe, but if Phase5 release the Caipirinha chipset as an Amiga Zorro graphics card, you could upgrade to a [Power] Power Amiga now, or whatever, and upgrade later ;)
