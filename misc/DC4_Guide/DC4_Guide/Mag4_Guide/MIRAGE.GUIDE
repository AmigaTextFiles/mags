Title : Mirage 
Author : F Paul Wilson and Matthew J Costello 
Publisher : Headline (1996) 
Type : Thriller 

Two twins - identical, yet in reality, they are very different. Sam has fallen into a coma which no one can explain, except possibly her twin, Julie.  

Julie, an experimental psychologist, uses the opportunity to test her 'memoryscape technique', a device which allows her to see inside patient's minds.  

This book certainly makes you want to read onto the end as fast as possible, and has a few nice twists in it. The 'memoryscape' seems rather bizzare; not too much at first, but later in the book, it has some quite wierd effects. It's getting onto The Outer Limits in this sense... Okay, in a horror novel, you expect the unbelievable, but it's not as if the story is centralised around the memoryscape, more around Sam and Julie.  

Sam's mind is falling apart, and Julie can only find shattered  memories, and strange metaphors with symbolic meanings. In finding the reason for Sam's coma, Julie uncovers a web of lies about their past.  

This is a good book, it certainly doesn't let you down at the end. The memoryscape means that the reader is fed bits of apparently meaningless information, sort of like in a murder mystery, but just a lot stranger.
