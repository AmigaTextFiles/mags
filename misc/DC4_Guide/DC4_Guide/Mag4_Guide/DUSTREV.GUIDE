Wow! I have to say that this is currently my favourite demo. It's split into two main sections. The first (not so good) section is a load of rocks and some digitised people, which you fly around. This is more clever use of sprites to create a 3D environment than anything like texture mapping. The action's broken up by the credits, done as light on a stone effect (very nicely done, too).  

The next section is much better, and a lot longer too. It starts off with a texture mapped planet and sun. Nice lighting effects. For mostt of the demo, their are loads of 3D objects, done at 1x1 resolution, and the frame rate is a lot faster than older demos doing the same thing. The backgrounds that the objects morph over are quite nice too.  

There are a few tunnel effects, and a nice 3D room - the frame rate drops here, but then you'd expect it to, as it appears to be a true 3D environment, certainly not a simple 'Doom' engine.  

And before I forget, the music's excellent! Get this demo! You must! It's brilliant! (Check out AFCD14, and a CUCD).
