Here's a screenshot of the game I'm working on that I have described in the Articles section (Work in Progress). It's PNG format, so please give it time to load!

Yes, the graphics are pretty sad, aren't they. As explained in that article, if any graphics artists want to lend a hand, then please write!  

Observant ones will notice how the buildings have an ugly grey border around them - basically, I have no idea on how to make a mask for these images. Can anyone help? Maybe C coders can help, as the AMOS bit doesn't matter, it's the intuition bit I don't know. The img structure is being used - how do I make a mask? Please tell me!  

And I have started to work on different terrain types, as shown by the (currently) randomly scattered mountain.
