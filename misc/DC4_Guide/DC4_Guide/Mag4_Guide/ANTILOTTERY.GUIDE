(An idea by Ben Dudman, typed up by Mark Harman...) 
	----------------------------------------
 Do you play the lottery? I don't, which means I get to save a pound every week! It's just that I have no chance of winning the lottery (but then, it's not likely anyway!) For people who play, they have great excitement as the balls come rolling out, only to go into depression afterwards. Me? When I (rarely) see the lottery, I love to see all those people who've wasted a pound, where as I haven't...  

What about those people who play, but also say 'I wouldn't want to win all that money'? Why the hell do they play then?! Surely it's not for the small wins, as on average you will lose more than you win. It can only be for the very small chance of becoming a millionaire.  

My friend, Ben, also felt like this about the Lottery, and came up with this rather interesting variation on the game, which  I will explain here for all you lucky readers... 
    	
    Pick your numbers. That's right, just as if you were going to play for real, select six numbers, but don't buy any tickets. 
    	
    Watch the Lottery and see the balls come rolling out... what's that, you haven't won? Hurrah! you've saved yourself a quid!  

Of course, the reason why this is better than what I first said (picking no numbers) is that there is the chance of winning - or at least you would have won if you had bought the ticket.  

Don't worry if it's a tenner, you'd probably save far more than you would have won in the long run. Try not to commit suicide though if all six numbers pop out.  

Why stick with one number? Some people do ten or more numbers a week, so you could save at least a tenner a week. And thanks to  the Wednesday draw, you can save twice as much! Why not do a syndicate? You save less, but anything you would have won would have had to have been shared out anyway.   

By actually picking numbers and not playing, you really can say that you have saved money... and if your numbers come up - who wants to be a millionaire anyway?
