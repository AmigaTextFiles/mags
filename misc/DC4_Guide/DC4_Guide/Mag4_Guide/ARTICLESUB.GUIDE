If you wish to send us an article, then please bear in mind the following points: 
 
    	
    Now we have the 'Articles, Other' section, you can really send in anything. You might like to consider: Tutorials, Reviews, Reference/Information, Views, Downloaded Web Pages, among others. 
    	
    If you are doing a programming article, any listings of program code should be commented as much as possible. 
    	
    It's even better if you supply source code as a separate file. 
    	
    We will try to accept all submissions, though we reserve the right to refuse any submissions. 
    	
    We reserve the right to edit any of the material that we receive (although we probably won't, except for formatting/HTML tags, etc). 
    	
    Please send the text in standard ASCII format, on either an Amiga (or PC) disk, to me (Mark), at the address given in the previous section.  
    	
    If you want any graphics or special effects happening in your article, include the relevant files, and explain clearly what you want; I may be able to handle it, as long as it's not too wierd! 
    	
    I will also accept articles on paper @{"b"}within reason@{"ub"}. I have better things to do than type in a several thousand word article...
