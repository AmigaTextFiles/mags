Title : Timelike Infinity 
Author : Stephen Baxter 
Publisher : HarperCollins (1992) 
Type : Science Fiction 

This is set a few thousand years in the future, in a dark age where humanity is ruled by the overpowering Qax. But as a great engineering project comes of age, a tunnel through time is opened  up into the distant past - although still our future.  

Naturally, some humans escape into the past, and are pursued by the Qax, but the humans are not at all interested in warning or at all involving the humans of this pre-Qax era. They have their own, greatly more bizarre, goal.  

This book makes very good reading. One thing that is apparant is how well the author tries to keep within the understanding of science, something especially difficult with the topic of time-travel. Indeed, the method of two wormholes, where one is accelerated to relativistic speeds, is used. As far as time paradoxes are concerened, it seems that even the people of the future are not sure what will happen. GUTDrives, singularity guns, sentient 'virtual' people and even living alien warships are here, all well thought out ideas that are not outlandish at all. And the Qax are far from being Little Green Men, and are very different to humans in form.  

Several themes appear in the book, notably that however bad the Qax are to humanity, it is no worse than what humans have done to each other in the past. 'Immortality drugs' are banned by  the Qax; when the thousand year old people of the past meet up with the youthful, mortal people of the future, in the end they end up feeling enviousof them.  

Highly recommended.
