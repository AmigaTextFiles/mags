How to Avoid Becoming a Vampire  

Prevention is always better than a cure... so make sure you or  any of your friends or family do not become vampires by following  these simple rules...  

The following circumstances of death shall be avoided: 
    	
    Dying excommunicate 
    	
    Dying unbaptized 
    	
    Dying apostate 
    	
    Dying while recovering from having been a werewolf - although  this can be avoided by isolation for two cycles of the moon, but watch out for sprouting hair or canines. 
    	
    Dying while under a curse from your parents 
    	
    Commiting suicide 
    	
    Dying from a fall from the left side of your wagon   

The following circumstances of birth shall be avoided: 
    	
    Being born with a tooth erupted 
    	
    Being born with red hair 
    	
    Being born the seventh son of a seventh son 
    	
    Being born the child of a mother who has slept with demons (one to watch out for) 
    	
    Being born with the placenta still over the head   

I hope you've been paying close attention... and as long as you avoid being promiscuous, being bitten by a vampire, and unknowingly drinking the blood of a vampire, you have nothing to fear!
