@{"b"}Articles Index@{"ub"}  

This is a section where we will list all the articles that have appeared in DoubleClick! The list is growing, but I want it much better!  

You may notice the format has been changed so it's a lot easier to read. Also, the author's/contributor's name has been added - so if you contribute to DoubleClick, your name will be on  all future issue to come! If somehow any names are wrong, then naturally, please tell us, but don't get to angry...  

Here goes:
