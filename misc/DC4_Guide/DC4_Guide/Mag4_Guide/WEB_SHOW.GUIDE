Computer Addict Makes Utimate Web Page 
 
In the daytime, a red haired 20 year old designs Web Pages in New 
York.  By night, she shares her bedroom with over 120,000 Web Surfers 
a week. 
 
Jennifer Ringley has installed a camera in her bedroom which takes her 
picture and beams it across the world every three minutes, which is 
viewed by thousands of computer users all over the world. 
 
"I have two personalities.  Theres's Jennifer, who nobody's interested 
in.  And there's Jenni. 
 
Jenni receives up to 700 E-Mails a day, and has received marriage 
proposals, and some more sinister, from users around the globe. 
 
"It allows people to be peeping toms, but without the guilt.", says 
Jenni.  Her Web Page features poems written by her, intimate photos of 
her body which compile a "Name That Curve" competiton, and an amazing 
100 GB of photographs stored per month. 
 
Users visiting her page download the images and swap them like 
"baseball cards" over the net with other users, and on other "Jenni" 
peepshow sites.  One Jenni archiver in Sweeden logged 60,000 visits in 
one DAY! 
 
Jennifer is a Web Page designer who works for the magazine National 
Geographic, has been on-line for two years. 
 
"I don't really have friends.  All of my friends are E-Mail 
Addresses.", she says. 
 
She occasionally has boyfriends who stay overnight, although not all 
of them are ready to be beamed across the Net.  "If it bothers them, I 
just turn the camera around.  There was one brave enough to do it but 
as soon as we got started, the Web Site got so many requests at once 
that my computer crashed, so nobody saw anything.". 
 
She has fans all over the globe.  Her British fans include a group of 
bisexual women.  Jenni says "One of them tells me she's leaving her 
husband because he's trying to stop her tuning me in.".  Californian 
David Dennis, a computer programmer said, "When I first saw her on the 
Jennicam she was topless.  I pretty much fell in love with her right 
away.". 
 
Jenni does have limits.  She did stop putting on a strip show after 
she was threatened by someone who was going to cut her up, and 
downloaded pictures of dead women onto her site.  "I was terrified.  I 
hid in my room for three days." 
 
Jenni now charges £10 a year subscription for her "services" and soon 
cameras will be installed in her house, so you will be able to see her 
in her living room and office.
