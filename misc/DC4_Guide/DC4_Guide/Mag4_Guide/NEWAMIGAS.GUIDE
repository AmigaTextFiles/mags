@{"b"}Ideas for New Amigas?@{"ub"}  

As I explained elsewhere, I think that selling upgraded A1200s  would be a good idea until new machines are available. But as to the future, we have A\BOX with the Caipirinha chipset. Surely this chipset could be put to use in other forms...  

The timescale I would be considering would be from early 1998 onwards for such machines. And also, all of these are PowerPC based and have some form of a Caipirinha chipset (I remember reading that cutdown versions would be available). The point is the PPC is far better value for money than anything in the 680x0 range. As far as a chipset, well, graphics cards could do just as  well of course, just as long as we don't just have AGA!  

	----------------------------------------
 @{"b"}Interactive TV set-top box thingy@{"ub"}. Will we ever see such an Amiga - we all know how the AmigaOS is perfect for the job, and even with just AGA, would do well (along with a nice 603e). 
	----------------------------------------
 @{"b"}Cut down A\BOX@{"ub"}. A super-Amiga at  £1500 sounds great, but a cut down version would be nice. Possibly: Slower PPC processors, Smaller hard drives / slower CD ROMs etc, no PCI slots, fewer other interfaces and a cut down version of the Caipirinha chipset would surely get the cost down and be useful for many people. 
	----------------------------------------
 @{"b"}New Amiga Console@{"ub"}. And I'm not talking about an '040 CD32 here! Okay, it would follow the concept of the CD32 in that it was an Amiga minus keyboard and everything. But make it PPC based, give it a cut down Caipirinha (I mean, a console could do without digitising, genlocking and multiple video outputs, I presume...), say, 8x CD ROM and 8/16MB RAM - Sell for around  £300, and at a time when the Playstation is old hat (and three years old), people will be looking for new consoles (Next-Next Generation?). And don't think that such a machine will be lacking power - with decent marketing, it could do very well, not to mention creating availability of loads of decent games for PowerAmiga / A\BOX! 
	----------------------------------------
 @{"b"}Amiga Laptop@{"ub"}. Almost as elusive as a RISC Amiga... this one keeps rearing its head. It's true that there isn't a great demand for such machines, being primarily used for business, but I still think it would be good to have them available. One possibility is for highend Video work, like with QuikPak A4000L 'luggables', but laptops instead, but I'm also thinking of the home Amiga user here. For example, you can get Mac laptops, even though there isn't a huge demand for them in business (only possibly DTP?) But any Mac users who would prefer a laptop have the option. Although more expense, some people may find it easier (for example, living at University, and travelling home?). And I know there are a lot of technical reasons why building an Amiga laptop isn't easy, but I'm talking about @{"b"}new@{"ub"} machines here, not taking an A1200, and somehow shrinking it down! Think about desktop PCs; you'd never make a laptop by shrinking down a massive Tower casing... it's a wonder that PC laptops can be done, but they can because they were designed to be laptops. As for things like AGA consuming too much power, well, that doesn't matter because we won't be using AGA, will we? 
	----------------------------------------
 What, I've run out of ideas already? You'll have to send yours in, to the usual address!
