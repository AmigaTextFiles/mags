Title: Poing 4  
Type: Breakout style Bat & Ball Game 
Author: Paul Van Der Valk 
Number Of Disks: 1 
Requirements: Any Amiga, Mouse   
Hard Disk Installable: Yes  
 
Being a great fan of Poing since the very first version years ago, I 
knew this would be something good.  It is unfortunately, Brilliant! 
 
There are a lot of new features in version 4, with new levels, more 
types of blocks, better graphics and sound, you name it. 
 
The overall aim of the game, of course, has not changed.  You still 
have to frantically wave the mouse up and down to stop the ball 
escaping, and bounce it off of the blocks.   
 
I like this version as, with other games the bat moves horizontally, 
but with Poing, it moves vertically.  I cannot explain why I prefer it 
this way, I just do.  Maybe in future versions you may be given the 
choice - who knows. 
 
You may wonder what this style of game has to offer in the way of 
gameplay.  You will think that it gets boring after a while, but as 
the levels progress, things get VERY difficult.  So much is the fun, 
that you just cannot put that mouse down. 
 
A great game which really does not have any major flaws in it at all.  
Worth of space on anyone's Hard Drive.
