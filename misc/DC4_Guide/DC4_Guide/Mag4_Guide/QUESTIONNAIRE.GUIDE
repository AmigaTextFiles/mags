@{"b"}Questionnaire!@{"ub"}  

This is a questionnaire which we would @{"b"}greatly@{"ub"} appreciate you taking the time to fill in. You can either copy it onto some paper, or alternatively, load this file into a text editor. From there, enter the details, and either save it to disk  or print it out (or fill it in after you've printed it - whatever) (Note that the questionnaire is free of HTML tags!) The file in question is 'Questionnaire.html'.  

I know it is quite a long questionnaire, so if you want to leave some bits blank for any reason, then feel free. We will only be using these results for our own purposes to produce a better mag, and although we will publish some results in future issues (providing we have enough replies!), we won't mention anyody specifically of course, just give generalisations of the results.  

Note that we will be storing the information in a database, just so you know, but as we said, this is for our (Mark and Stephen) purposes only. Now on with the questions...
