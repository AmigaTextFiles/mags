@{"b"}AF Prophecies@{"ub"}  

I've ben reading Amiga Format for a long time now (since issue 29), and I've noticed, well, a few oddities which could be taken as powerful predictions of the future. Let's look at what I've uncovered so far...  
	----------------------------------------
  

@{"b"}Remember@{"ub"} when AF used to print a silly message on the spine of the mag. They stopped that about a year and a half ago, but one I remember in particular was 'Start Me Up'. So what was that in reference to? Of course, taking the piss out of the relese of Windoze 95, with that bloody song and Start button. Except... this was on the January 1994 issue!  
	----------------------------------------
  

@{"b"}I@{"ub"} thought it was a one off coincedence, but then reading an older issue (1993, sometime), I was reading the review of that game with the Quavers bloke (Push Over). In bold large type, the review began with some lyrics or the 'rubber tree plant' song. Yes, you must know the one I mean, as it appears on all those MicroSoft ads... And this is the only time AF ever printed any song lyrics as far as I know (except for single lines).  
	----------------------------------------
  

@{"b"}Sometimes@{"ub"} they can appear on a more 'serious' level. All this Amiga going PowerPC stuff - remember, the Amiga only got involved with PowerPC at the end of 1995 when AT announced the chip as the future. During and shortly after C=, the new RISC Amigas would be based on HP PA-RISC thingys. And the point was, the concept of a PowerPC Amiga was generally considered totally ubsurd. So around 1994, someone writes into AF Letters, and heretically asks why new Amigas can't use PowerPC. The editor (whoever it was) replies that that's a no no, and gives all sorts  of reasons, like Macs working differently to Amigas, and such, and basically, he was totally against the idea. Except, at the end of the reply, for no apparant reason, says (and I quote) 'I wouldn't be surprised if **** used the PowerPC Chip at some stage' He knew ! Okay, **** was Commodore, which obviously isn't the case, but it would be too much to spill the beans on Gateway 2000 as well. Either that, or he was momentarily possessed by some prophetic being, who made him write that, before returning him to his complete anti-Power PC self.  
	----------------------------------------
  

I know what you're thinking, coincedences. But I've not done any studying of the mags, this it what I've just noticed over the years - what could an indepth investigation reveal? How many prophecies are there that have yet to be fulfilled? Why @{"i"}did@{"ui"} AF stop putting messages on the spine - was it because the person who wrote it had discovered some terrible prophecy that could not be revealed?  

@{"b"}Readers@{"ub"}, if you have discovered any prophecies in AF, even if alone they are not much, and could easily be coincedence, please write in! And how about other mags? Tell me what you know...
