@{"b"}Patch Roundup@{"ub"}  

This is where I review those little but very useful programs. Please feel free to contribute!  

@{"b"}PowerWindows@{"ub"} v0.95 (Georg Steger) I think this is a great idea! You know on the Mac you can move windows 'out' of the  screen area, and then drag them back again, well this program lets you do that! It's really useful to avoid cluttering up your screen without having to close windows. It also adds an iconify gadget which works rather well. Note that this is an early version, which does have various bugs, but hopefully these will be fixed soon!  

@{"b"}KingCON@{"ub"} v1.3 (David Larsson) I finally got round to installing this, I don't know why I didn't before! This basically  alters your Shell so it's a hell of a lot better, in rather a similar way to ZShell, in fact. But where as ZShell was a replacement program for the shell, this works by copying some libraries/devices, and the existing shell is modified. I think that KingCon is better than ZShell, with things like Scrollbars and Menus, as well as Devicename and Command completion (as opposed to just filename completion). There are lots of other options too. But it isn't all better - I prefer the way ZShell does filename completion, by pressing the Tab key as it is generally quicker than selecting from a menu window. But whichever you have, they are both better than the standard shell,  so make sure you have one of them!
