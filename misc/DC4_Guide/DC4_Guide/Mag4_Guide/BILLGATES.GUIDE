SCENE 1    "THE OFFICE"
-------
(Bill Gates is sitting in his office reading his employees reports)

BG = Bill Gates
EM = Employee

BG - Fools!! Windows97 won't be ready in time!
EM - But sir most programmers have taken their Christmas break.
BG - Ohh I hate Christmas, I hate presents, I hate people.
EM - What should I do sir?
BG - Recall ALL programmers now! If they don't finish the code they
     won't leave this place, ever.. Hahaha!


SCENE 2   "HOME"
-------
(Bill Gates has fallen asleep in his bed)

G = Ghost...

(Whop) = sound of spontaneous transportation

(A loud sound wakes Bill Gates, like a thousand souls in perpetual
torment, you know, the sound you make when installing Pee Cee
software and find you've run out of Hard Disk space before full
installation)

G  - I have come miserable one!
BG - What are you? What do you want from me? Do you know who I am?
G  - Ohh yes I know cursed one. You're the guy who tried to sell
     software at Paradise's accounting office. Do you know how much
     loss they've had? Damn you...
BG - It's not MY fault...
G  - Shut up! Tonight, three ghosts will visit you... They'll show you
     what an asshole you are... He he he,  Go to sleep now, you
     motherfucker. (Whop)

(Obviously, this is ONE hell of a ghost!).


SCENE 3  "THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST"
-------
(Bill Gates has fallen asleep again thinking it was only a dream.
Suddenly a cold limp pair of lips kiss him on the forehead and a camp
voice shouts in his ear).......

G  - Wakey wakey, its 12 o'clock you useless miserably stupid
     cretinous fuckwit nerd.         It's showtime..........
     The ghost had a hang up with the Film Beetleguse.
BG - Who are you? What are you? You look like a pansy, what do you
     want from me, a poor and honest housebuild. Erm, programmer?
G  - Programmer my sweet ass.  I'm the ghost of Christmas past and
     I'll take you on a journey to the past to see your Christmas
     many years ago.. Take my hand now sweetie pie before I start
     slapping your ass..
BG - Oh fuck!!!!!! (Whop)



SCENE 4 "TO THE SHOPS"
-------

(The ghost has transported Bill Gates to a computer shop at some past
Christmas and there's a huge crowd in the shop with lots of kids
buying stuff).

S  = Shop Keeper
FA = Father
KI = Kid

S  - So, what will it be?
KI - I want the Amstrad 6128 with a colour monitor..
FA - That's too expensive son, why don't you get the Spectrum?
KI - Or should we take the Commodore 64 which has lots of games?
BG - How foolish they were. Today that kid would be given a P150 with
     Windows and it wouldn't want anything else.
G  - And you think it would be happy? Fool. Look at how happy it is
     NOW, with a computer a thousand times smaller than the one you
     would have given him...
BG - I don't build computers, I only sell software.
G  - Smiling sweetly , Have a look at that miserable box over there..
S  - Of course, you can also buy this professional PC sir!
KI - No dad, I don't want it, it's no good..
G  - Smirking, Oh, how much! The kid knows!
FA - But it plays games, AND we'll also be able to run professional
     programs!
S  - And as Bill Gates said, "256K of Memory SHOULD be enough for
     everyone".
BG - Harumpfff.
G  - Hey sweet buns, have a look at that crowd of people over there..
BG - Hmm, they're at a.. A.. Ohh an Amiga.. My there going nuts over
     the games on that machine..
G  - (Whack! Whack!! Slapping Gates arse with a bag containing the
     lastest issue of Pee Cee help disks,..... The bag is very heavy).
     You stupid monkey, take a look at that miserable creature at the
     PC.
BG - With his back to the wall, Hmm, he's programming in Fortran using
     Ehem, edlin!
G  - What have you got to say about it?
BG - For it's time, it was...
G  - It was SHIT. As are Windows for their time.. But, it's time for
     me to leave you back at your house. Once he's finished with
     Saddam the second ghost will come over to show you Christmas in
     the present time....
BG - But I want to see how I was then..
G  - Sorry, honny bun, I'm in a hurry.. All I can say is that you were
     a slimy little nerd who liked to creat amateur programs with a
     "Professional" label.
     Are people so stupid after all? .. Byeeeee... (Whop)


                        --- Commercial Break ---

The special effects on Babylon 5, Star Trek Deep Space 9, Sea Quest 
and Space Precinct are generated by AMIGA computers using Lightwave 
software :) :) :) .


An AMIGA A1200 runs SHAPESHIFTER (a MACINTOSH II emulator)  2 and a 
half times faster than the real MACINTOSH II  :) .





SCENE 5  "CHRISTMAS PRESENT"
-------
(We don't want to bore you, so the second ghost came along, he was
less camp and talkative than the first, he just gobbed on Bill and
took him to a place full of PCs running Windows :( :( :( :( :( :(

U = Users (ordinary PC users - as they are commonly known)


BG - What did you bring me here for?
G  - To see the pain you're causing to the users.. Look! And gobs on
     Gates again.
BG - Why is he crying?  Moaned Bill wishing he'd worn rubber.
G  - Gobs again on Bates, Sighs and stares fixedly at the ceiling.
BG - Oh! I see, humffp, Win95 crashed and he lost all his work,
     too bad..
G  - Still staring upwards, gobs silently in a high arc accurately
     down Gates neck and then starts whistling quietly.
BG - Erm why is he laughing like a maniac? ... Mopping his neck half
     heartedly.
G  - Eyes like saucers, spraying spit everywhere and whistling more 
     shrill. 
BG - Hmm, His hard disk is full.. 2.5GB fULL !!!!!, It's not MY fault
     Windo..............Why is he hitting the keyboard with his head?
U  - Fucking asshole Bill Gates, it's been eight hours and still the
     fuckin' installation isn't finished!!!!.....
U1 - I don't understand why they have such huge demands on memory and
     CPU?
BG - Because it's a very good operating system... The ghost gobbed so
     hard this time Gates is knocked off his feet.
U  - Simply put, Billy-boy has it all his way. He forces the users to
     buy bigger hard disks, more memory, etc. He's taking all of us
     for fools!
U1 - The worst part is that everyone follows him..
BG - He he he, of course. He ducks too late, half a gallon of gob hits
     him square in the face.
G  - Fool. You don't understand a thing!.Let's go to a bookshop (whop)
BG - Ahaa! They're reading my book!
U  - Bill Gates is such an asshole!
BG - Hey! I've heard that before somewhere.
U1 - His book is the most lame thing I've ever read in my life! It's
     even worse than using DOS.
U  - He's writing as if he invented it all!
U1 - Yeah! He! Invented the internet, he! Gave multitasking to
     humanity..
U  - I bet it doesn't say that he tortured people for so many years
     with his fuckin'-DOS!
U1 - Why?... Do you think that in 2020 he'll write that he tortured
     people with Windows?
U  - IF he's still alive then he he he ...
U1 - Hahahahaha! Check this joke out: We've got Hitler, Saddam and
     Bill Gates in a room and a pistol with only two bullets, what do
     we do?
U  - Dunnow, What?
U1 - Shoot Bill Gates twice!
BG - Enough!, I say enough!!!
G  - Spitting accurately between each word.   OK, let's, go, for, a, 
     ride, to, your, corporation's, labs.. (Whop)


                        --- Commercial Break ---

A PEE CEE needs 8 times more ram than an AMIGA to do the same task ;).



(P1-P2 =  Micro$oft Programmers).

P1 - It's Christmas and I have to work for the Asshole.*
BG - grrrrr.. Gloop, another direct hit from the ghost.
P2 - Yeah, the fuckhead wants us to finish that fuckcode*


* =  These are talented programmers who once had dreams but ended up
     working for Bill Gates..


P1 - The Asshole has got on my nerves with that fuckin'compatibility
     of his.
P2 - And with that fuckin' DOS of his.
P1 - And those fuckin' features he ordered..
P2 - The Asshole has so much publicity that all those useless moron
     monkeys who buy a Pee Cee buy his shit.
P1 - I'm finished, send it to some beta tester. I'm going home.. How
     about you?
P2 - I'm going to send an anonymous hate mail to Bill, he he he.....
BG - So THAT's who's been sending me anonymous mails for the last 2
     years.. My finest programmer!! Oh my God!!!. Gob cascades down
     his shirt front and oozes out of his navel.
G  - Look at the pain you're causing to the world! Don't you
     understand? This surprises Gates on two counts. 1, for the
     content and 2, because its gob free.
BG - No.. I'm tougher than Scrooge and I'm never going to change my
     tactics.. Leave me alone.. I want to sleep.
G  - Then go to sleep, he he he and wait for the third ghost.. He
     vanishes. (Whop).
BG - After a shower and change Billy boy climbs into bed, to find the
     ghost has filled it with gob....




SCENE 6  "CHRISTMAS FUTURE"
-------

(The third ghost even less talkative and subtle than the first two
simply wakes Bill with a resounding kick in the balls, grabs him by
the scruff of the neck and takes him to a computer shop circa
Christmas 2015).

BG - Managing to gasp out, If you start showing me scenes of my death
     to make me change my mind forget it. I won't change a thing..
G  - Releases his grip, drops Gates into some dog shit and says Look!!
BG - Stumbling to his feet, Where? At the shop? Oh !! We're in the
     year 2015 let's see what software is released. He strides
     towards the shop and a whiff of dog shit trails behind in his
     wake.
BG - Peers in through the shop front. Autocad86, Wordperfectxxi,
     Scalatl1000, ehm.. Strange, I don't see my company's mark
     anywhere.. Ghost, where are my products?
G  - He he he, I'll make you visible to humans for a while. Why don't
     you ask them..


                        --- Commercial Break ---

486 DX Pee Cee @ 66 MHz = AMIGA A4000 T @ 25 MHz he he he he he 
                                        --------




(Bill Gates steps into the shop and starts a conversation with the
shopkeeper).

S =  Shopkeeper

BG - Excuse me do you have Windows 2015?
S  - Haaahahahaha thank you sonny that made me laugh! And Sniffs
     suspiciously...
BG - Why? What did I say? Which Windows have you got? Which version?
S  - Aaaahahahaha please stop it, ahaha! .... Sniffs again and looks
     around with a puzzled expression on his face.
BG - Tell me, what happened to Windows?
S  - But son where have you been all these years? OK Sometime in 2000
     all the companies started fighting back, with the help of
     millions of angry users they started a new revolution.... Leans
     forward and sniffs again but gently this time.
BG - What do you mean?
S  - Masteros v1.0 came out. Then came 1.3 etc, then Corel and all the
     rest of those programs came out in versions for this OS, and the
     stocks of Microsoft fell to 20% in a year!. Leans back and frowns
     at Gates intently.
BG - Then what?
S  - Takes a deep breath and says, Then Apple started along with Amiga
     then came IBM with Motorola and they released brand new
     operating systems for a new generation of standard hardware.
     Microsoft kept losing ground, until in 2008 it crashed under its
     huge debts. He walks backward quickly, gagging.
BG - That can't be!
S  - Shouts at Gates from the opposite side of the shop, and all that
     wouldn't have happened if Bill Gates had listened to the world's
     negative comments.

Bill Gates, obviously disappointed, comes out of the shop and walks
over to the Ghost, offhand he notices a lot of dogs in the street.

BG - Ghost, er, can I change something?
G  - Grins wildly and hums to himself.

The dogs have formed a circle around Gates. Staring....

BG - Talk to me yells Gates, can I?
G  - Stops humming, Yes I should think so.... Time to go home..(Whop)


(The rest, goes like this)

Billy wakes up before Christmas and cancels the release of Windows97,
the world becomes a better place, and Amigatech releases Amigaos 5,
which gets 51% of software sales in the world. A multi platform
machine is released and competition is good for everybody, so they
lived happily ever after!

But what happened to the guest star?

Bill Gates entered a cryogenic unit. He'll wake up after 100 years to
see how his business is going. He he he he.
