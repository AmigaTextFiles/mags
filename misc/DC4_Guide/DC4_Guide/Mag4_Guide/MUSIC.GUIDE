Rejection - Only 8k in size! 
L'Amour - By NightShade / xtc - Only 10k in size! 
The Golden Ages - A longer mod for you, by Matthew Simmonds.  

The OctaMedPlayer is being used for this, as the AMOS music system isn't really that good... You can Restart/Continue/Stop the music by selecting from the music menu, and even Free it to save precious Chip RAM.  

Note to readers from issue 3 and before: OctaMedPlayer's ARexx interface is now being used, so you no longer have to click both mouse buttons to stop the music, etc (that won't work!)  

If there are any readers wishing to @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/OTHERSUB.GUIDE/MAIN"} send in a mod, then we'll be pleased to accept it. We'd like at least two mods for each issue.
