@{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/ISSUE_5_GIFT.PNG/MAIN"} Read about an exciting Issue 5 offer!  

Issue 5, out in the later months of 1997... (I don't when this  issue will be finished, let alone the next one!)  

What we do know is that there'll be @{"b"}loads@{"ub"} more articles, more news, views, @{"b"}tutorials@{"ub"} and reviews, @{"b"}more@{"ub"} contributors, more jokes, alien abduction accounts, and @{"b"}other@{"ub"} stuff completely unrelated to computing...  

There also be an updated viewer for the full version, allowing among other things secret articles, better effects, quicker loading.  

We'll see you there!
