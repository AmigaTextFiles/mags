	@{"i"}...a View@{"ui"}  

Just a short article to let you know a few of my views on Piracy.  

Now, I agree that piracy is wrong, and I'm sure it does reduce the sales of software as a whole, but I feel there are quite a few ideas floating around that I simply disagree with.  

@{"b"}The scale that it affects sales.@{"ub"} Obviously, this is very different to assess, but a lot of people suggest if nobody pirated a game (either because it couldn't be pirated, or laws were much stricter), then all those who would have pirated the game would instead buy it. I really can't see this being the case - with piracy, you are getting the game virtually for free. If the price is now a lot higher because you have to buy the game, it's basic economics that less will be 'sold' - ie, not all the pirates will buy the game. So yes, without piracy, sales would be higher, but not by as much as some would have us believe.  

@{"b"}Cheaper software would mean no piracy.@{"ub"} Again, this wouldn't be so unless it was a cheap as a pirate could get it - ie, free! Cheaper software may well increase software sales, but not necessarily because of less piracy (there may be more piracy, because of more originals in circulation making easier access for 'casual' pirates). Let's face, I'm sure software companies have done there research when it comes to selling prices, so to suggest they would make more money with lower prices, without having done any research ourselves, isn't very wise...  

@{"b"}'Piracy killed the Amiga'.@{"ub"} [NB - The fact that we're still here means that 'killed' wasn't really the right word, but it's not that point I want to argue here!] Whatever caused the downfall of our beloved machine (and I'm sure multiple company failures and many arse-companies had something to do with it), there is plenty of piracy on other platforms (ie, the PC). It seems to be doing okay, doesn't it? More to the point, surely when piracy started killing off the Amiga, it was when it was really successful. So everyone buys a PC, and the pirates follow. So what now, loads of piracy on the PC, so let's go to another machine? The point is, like it or not, any computer doing well as a games machine will have plenty of piracy on it. If companies leave (eg, the Amiga) because of piracy, then all that will happen is when another games machine/computer comes along (like the PC), then the pirates will copy games on there too. You can't win! 
	----------------------------------------
 

I'm not against all ideas, though. When interesting one is that in the Amiga's current state, piracy is very harmful (ie, piracy didn't kill of the Amiga at all, but in this fragile condition, piracy isn't exactly helpful).  

But that's anothe good thing about all the up and coming games being CD only - a lot harder to pirate. Maybe there's a lot to do with attitude too. If there was a game on a couple of disks that barely took advantage of a basic A1200, someone with a reasonably upgraded A1200 is hardly going to go out and buy it, but piracies another matter. With games that start to take advantage of our machines, there will be a lot more people prepared to pay the money, because they're getting something decent. Yeah, there will still be piracy, especially if the game doesn't occupy much space on a hard disk, but that won't matter so much if plenty buy the game too - just like in the old days...  

And don't forget high street stores - getting DDs onto a shelf is a lot harder than CDs, and one reason is that many people will buy games on disk to pirate, and then bring back, which is a lot less likely with CDs.
