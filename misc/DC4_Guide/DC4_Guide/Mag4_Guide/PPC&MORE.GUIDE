@{"b"}PowerPC and More!@{"ub"} 
	@{"i"}...Things Are Looking Up!@{"ui"}  

We've been through bad times... very bad times, but maybe things could be looking a lot better for the future.  

I'm not talking solely about Gateway 2000's purchase of Amiga Technologies. Although this is good news, and I believe better than Quikpak or Viscorp buying them, it will be some time before new machines could appear - and just remember what happened with Escom.  

We have the third party companies promising to bring us fantastic Amigas for the future. And now, finally, these are staring to appear. No more 'so and so are releasing a brilliant Amiga clone sometime next year. Possibly', things at last are starting to @{"i"}happen@{"ui"} again.  

Direct Software and their 'Power'Amiga - not PowerPC, but a very nice machine anyway. Sure, it may still not give us PC performance, and not as good as what the A\Box promises - but on the other hand, it's a hell of a lot better than what we currently have available otherwise.  

'060, 64 bit graphics card, 22MB RAM, CD ROM, 1GB Hard drive, Monitor - for £1500. An A4000T/060 would cost well over £2000, with 6MB RAM, no graphics card, CD ROM, or a monitor... An A1200T/060 would fare better on price, but still not as good. And we mustn't forget that you have to buy loads of separate bits of hardware and stick them altogether, rather than buying it all at once. Before, if you had around a grand and a half to spend on an Amiga, there just @{"i"}wasn't@{"ui"} anything worth buying, realistically. Now there is.  

The inclusion of both monitor and graphics card for the price is excellent value, in my opinion. Even '060 based, it compares very well against a PowerMac. But it is rumoured that this could be upgraded to PowerPC in the future, or at least newer models will - if this machine makes use of a Cyberstorm card, then that is quite likely, considering the PowerPC accelerator boards are finally here (ooh, what a nice link that was)...  

If you have an A4000, a Cyberstorm PPC with 604e will cost £499.95 at 150MHz, to £699.95 for 200MHz. For A1200s, there's a 603e costing £279.95 (speed unknown).  

But what about an Amiga with a PowerPC as standard. It is rumoured that 'Mk 2' of Direct's Power Amiga will be PowerPC based, with an '040 or '060 as a 'fallback' CPU. So, you could have a much faster 603 / 604 machine for around the same price - now that is good! (Assuming, say, a 25MHz '040 CPU, which must be pretty cheap).  

So PowerPC is finally here for the Amiga - and it doesn't stop there.
