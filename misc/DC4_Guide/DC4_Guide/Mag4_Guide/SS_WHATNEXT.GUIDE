SoundStudio - The perfect tracker! What more could we want? Well, however great the product, there are still improvements that could be made, but more to the point, will there be a new version?  

I cannot be the only one rather annoyed at that 'this may be the last Amiga version' window that pops up every time you start (anyone know a way to disable it!?)  

And you will surely know of the PC port that is under way. Is it me, or does their Website mention this at every oppurtunity? Like there are going to be lots of PC readers visiting an Amiga Octamed site...  

Agreed, there is a bigger market for the PC now, sadly, but do they think they can abandon the Amiga, port it to the PC, and make millions? Remember, SoundStudio is great not as a MIDI seequencer or anything (although it can do that, of course). It's superb ability is to get the most out of the Amiga's CPU, possibly with the help of a soundcard, ridding us of those 4 channel limitations, taking us to 64 channel 16 bit stereo. But the PC requires sound cards anyway, and I presume there are plenty of dedicated sequencers already available. SS may be king on the Amiga, but it won't be at all on the PC.  

(Why does the PC OctaMED@{"i"}Player@{"ui"}  recommend a 486? PCs - Efficiency at work, not)  

Okay, there's nothing wrong with porting to the PC, it's the abandonning the Amiga bit that naturally annoys me, and for some reason, the Amiga users seem rather quiet on this front. Consider PowerPC: A port of SS what be great, right? With all that power, even with no sound card, some CD quality music with loadsa channels playing in real time should be no trouble. But among all the talks of which programs are going to be PPC ported, or among all the wishlists of PPC ports, everyone seems to have forgotten SoundStudio. I wouldn't care if they discontinued the Amiga 680x0 as long as they ported to PPC Amiga as well as the PC... Looking through their website, PowerPC doesn't seem to be mentioned once, or any information on future versions given.  

Go on RBF, give us SoundStudio for Amiga PowerPC! @{"i"}Pleeease...@{"ui"}

@{"b"}PS@{"ub"} There's a page on the SS Website that proudly claims how they use MicroSoft (TM) products to produce their pages, and as such, outdated browsers would have difficulty displaying the pages. Hmmm... This particular page (and only this page from what I saw) had some text a bit wonky, a pity that the authors of Voyager hadn't kept up to date with all the changes to HTML the Microsoft probably decided to take... Any other HTML creation package would be in the wrong for not following the rules properly, and producing pages that browsers couldn't read correctly.  

Curiously, my Amiga decided to spontaneously crash at that point, something that Voyager hadn't done previously... I probably didn't have enough RAM to view that page.  
	----------------------------------------
 @{"b"}PPS@{"ub"} (this is getting like my letters...) : Latest news is that there will be an updated SoundStudio. Probably not until 1998, it will feature full support for AHI and 16 bit samples, although not much else is known.
