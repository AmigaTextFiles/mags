Title: Piles 'O' Tiles 
Type: Shareware Puzzle Game 
Author: Paul Burkey  
Number Of Disks: 1 
Requirements: Mouse  
Supports: Any Amiga  
Hard Disk Installable: Yes 
 
Being the "Match The Pairs" style of game that this is, you would 
expect something very bland, and basic. Not so. This is of commercial 
quality, and has loads of different tile deigns. Some of them are 
very close in appearance, which does add to the fun of the game. 
 
There are 10 levels in this game, although registering will let you 
have access to the full 42. They are all of devellish quality and can 
be quite challenging, in fact, it took me about 20 attempts to 
complete one level. 
 
I know that I am byest towards these games, as I like puzzles, but I 
really cannot fault this game, and must give it full marks. I will of 
course, be sending my registration fee, as I did for Dragon Tiles, 
the other MTP game that I reviewed, as regular readers will no doubt 
be aware.
