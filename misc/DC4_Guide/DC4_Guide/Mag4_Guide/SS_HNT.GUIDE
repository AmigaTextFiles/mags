@{"b"}SoundStudio@{"ub"} Tips  

Just a tour around some of SS's features, and advice and such on them.  

@{"b"}Converting 4/8 channel to mixing mode@{"ub"}. This is a fairly simple matter, but some things to bear in mind. The samples have to be transposed up 2 octaves. Also, the tempo is different to 8 channel mode, so you'll have to change out. Another thing to watch is stereo - before, channels 0 and 2 were one side, and 1 and 3 the other. With mixing mode, this doesn't matter, and all channels are combined to produce a single mono sample, or if you prefer, a stereo sample. In the latter case though, the channels come out not just Left or Right, but however you want, thanks to the Panning options. There were also other restrictions with 8 channel mode, particularly sharing of volumes on pairs of channels - thankfully, this is gone.  

@{"b"}Output options@{"ub"}. Lacking a sound card, I just output in 8 bit, real time at 28kHz. I did try recording direct to disk, but now I can't bothered! I am disappointed with 14 bit though. Sure, at first looks it is better quality, but it's also half volume, so you have to turn your stereo right up to hear... and that's load enough to get all the hiss on the tape, which means you end up with worse quality, not better! (Can anyone help me out on this one?) Even without 14bit, the sound volume may be a bit low, so remember the Volume boost at the bottom of the Mixing  window; just set this as high as you can without distorting it.  

@{"b"}Panning and Stereo@{"ub"}. This is really cool! It's good to add panning to your mods; by moving an instrument 'off-centre' of the stereo image, you can make it heard more clearly, which can be a better method than just playing it louder. I've seen some modules which have alternate channels set at completely Left or Right, to produce dynamic stereo effects.  

@{"b"}Getting decent samples@{"ub"}. Make sure you have a decent set  of samples of course. CD ROM owners are well catered for of course. One thing I have done is to utilise the sample banks of GMPlay, which gives me a nice selection of 128 instruments and 128 drums to play with (and remember that's @{"i"}all@{"ui"} you get to  use with GMIDI!) Also, even though only 8 bit, they are 44.1kHz, making them good quality. One thing to watch out for is samples with the same name, as this causes problems with the Sample List Editors - especially annoying with CDs, as you can't just rename the sample!
