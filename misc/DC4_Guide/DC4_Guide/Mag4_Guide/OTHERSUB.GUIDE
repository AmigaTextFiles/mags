You might also like to submit:  

 
    	
    @{"b"}Pictures.@{"ub"} These can be any size, and you can use AGA if you wish. The less memory they take up, the more we can include, and the more chance there is of us including it! Send them preferably as IFFs, but GIFs, JPEGS, etc, are fine. 
    	
    @{"b"}Music.@{"ub"} These must be saved as modules, and @{"b"}not @{"ub"}songs. I can read standard tracker files, as well as Octamed files (That includes 8 channel ones, and maybe SoundStudio too). Again, don't make them to large, as space will be very limited. If you are unsure of the file type, send a Module Player that will play your piece. 
    	
    @{"b"}Anything else.@{"ub"} Such as samples (I can read most formats; 8 or 16 bit, mono or stereo), or maybe even complete programs; though make 'em small! 
    	
    @{"b"}Programs@{"ub"} for review (PD section). Please state if it is freeware, shareware, or something else. (You might also like to place an @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/RDADSUB.GUIDE/MAIN"} advert for it, though remember that you must also send an article of some kind to place an ad!)  

Please send contributions on an Amiga (or PC) disk to either Mark Harman or Stephen Graham. Note that copyright of any  such material will remain with the submittor, although he may wish to outline his own conditions (eg, making it completely PD, so anyone can use it).
