I  only wish I had bought this game sooner,  as it is brilliant.  Sure,  I 
had  played all of the Demos on all the magazine coverdisks,  but I  never 
really took to the game,  as golf is not my number one sport.  I have been 
a long supporter of Sensible software, buying such games as Cannon Fodder, 
SWOS  96 etc,  and always liked the way they present themselves.  Comical, 
yet  (look  up  dictionary)   vaguely  serious.   Just  one  look  at  the 
Instruction booklet would tell me that this was a good game. 
 
There is a whole host of courses to play on,  from Rome to Tenerife, which 
are  all  expertly designed and drawn to perfection.  Even the trees  look 
lifelike  which is more than can be said for golf games  I  am  previously 
used  to.   The  sound effects that play while you are on your  round  are 
excellent,  although I don't really like the tune that asks "Do you  wanna 
play golf" at 100 Decibels when you load in the game at first,  but  as  I 
had my HiFi at 150,000 watts,  that does not really surprise me!  I really 
liked the Speech when you score a Triple Bogey (Although, I have improved) 
which  was  clear and very comical.  I also have a golf  simulator  on  my 
Phillips CDi,  and it has running commentary all the way through the game. 
A  lot to ask for this game,  as the CPU will be working overtime with the 
graphics scrolling,  which is very smooth,  but would add to the sound  by 
100%. 
 
Although  the game uses a similar engine to Cannon Fodder,   it  is  still 
very enjoyable,  although I am unable to hit the ball at any birds, as the 
cover on the box suggests. 
 
Hard  Disk  installation would have put the score higher,  but apart  from 
that,  a very worthwhile purchase.  How long before we see a Battle  Chess 
style  game,   which  I played on an Insanely Boring  Mouldy  Pretty  Crap 
computer  (Boo  Hiss!)   and not the old Amiga version,   called  Sensible 
Chess, where pieces blow each other up etc? 
 
Graphics    -  95 % - A mindblowing experience 
Sound       -  95 % - Not enough, but still good  
Lastability -  90 % - Very good, as you play a full round 
Playability -  96 % - Cannot put the joystick down, so a winner for me! 
 
Overall - Very good game, which I wish I had bought sooner, so 94 %.
