World  War  3  was narrowly averted recently,  when a 16 year  old  computer hacker broke into the computer system at a major US Air Force base.  

Richard Pryce,  16, who was known on the Internet as the "Datastream Cowboy" managed to hack into the computer network at Griffiss Air Force Base in  New York,   and  a  computer  network run by the American  aircraft  and  missle manufacturer,   Lockheed.  From there he caused chaos when  he  invaded  the computer  system of an atomic research institute in Korea.  The  US  was  at this  time  terrified  as  they were in the middle of delicate  negotiations with  the  North  Koreans  when this breach of  security  appeared  to  have originated from a US air base.  

Military chiefs at the Pentagon,  believed that Pryce was part of an Eastern European  spy  ring,  and was attemptinng to steal top secret blueprints  of the latest military hardware from the weapons and aircraft headquarters.  

One  report  claimed that he had managed to gain access to  a  report  which contained  the US battle plan to stop Soviet forces if they invaded  Western Europe.  

Pryce,   cracked the codes used to defend missle systems using a  £750  home computer bought to help him with his exams from a high street store,  on the third floor of his house in Colindale, North London.  

The  US  Senate armed services committee was told that the Royal College  of Music  A  level  student was "the number one threat  to  US  security".   He downloaded enough data to fill 3,000 sheets of A4 paper with text,   on  his 200  visits to the system.  This data was found on Pryce's Hard Drive,  when Scotland  Yard  detectives from the Computer  Crime  Unit  raided  his  semi detatched home on May 12, 1994.  

He  managed  this feat by the use of a "bluebox" - which is  software  which imitates  the  tones of modern telephones.  This enabled  him  to  trick  an exchange in Bogota,  Columbia,  that a free charge call had been terminated, but  still have his computer on-line.  This meant he could use his  computer as  long  as he wanted and there would be no excessive call charges  on  his parents phone bill, who had no idea about his actions.  

His  father,  who runs a business restoring musical instruments  said  about when  his son was arrested:  "It was around 7pm and I was watching  TV  when about  eight cars pulled up and people started banging on the door.  When  I answered it,  the officers came filing in and said,  'Is Richard Pryce in?'. It was like a scene from the movies.  I thought 'My God,  what has he done?' There were so many of them, I thought he must have killed someone.".  

"They  burst  into  his  room and pulled his hands away  from  his  computer keyboard.   Then they stripped his room.  When I went up the stairs  he  was sitting  there  in  shock while they were ripping up his floorboards.   They searched his room for five hours.  They took his computer away,  as well  as all his A level books and our telephone handset.".  

Mr Pryce,  49,  who has two other children, Katie, 15 and Sally, 17, neither of  which  are  particularly keen on computing,  said that their  neighbours were horrified at the events unfolding in their quiet crescent of houses.  

He  added:  "They must have thought we were Fred and Rosemary West when  all these cars converged on our house. It was awful.".  

Richard,   who  also  had a passionate interest in military  matters,   used telephone  numbers exchanged between hackers on the Internet.  The  computer system  he  broke into held top secret files on the research and development of the latest ballistic missle systems.  All that was required to read these files was a password,  which he was able to break relatively easily. He used another  piece of software,  a "sniffer",  which was obtained  from  another hacker.   This  enabled  him to capture the streams  of  data  held  on  the American  computer system.  When he read these streams on his own  computer, the  schoolboy  invariably found passwords used  by  military  personnel  to access  the  system,   which  would also have been  transmitted  with  these streams.  

This  went on for months.  US military intelligence logged over 200 breaches of  security and the Criminal Intelligence Agency were convinced  that  this was the work of an Eastern European spy ring,  and not that of a 16 year old A level student.  

A  "sting" operation was mounted as an agent posed as a fellow hacker.   The agent  and  Pryce started an on-line conversation,  where Pryce  unwittingly told  him  that  he  was a 16 year old schoolboy,  from  England,   with  an interest in US military systems.  The British security service and  Scotland Yard were immediately informed about the teenage hacker,  and a surveillance operation was launched.  When it was aparent that Pryce was indeed a 16 year old,   he  was  arrested.  After the raid on his home,  police found  enough incriminating evidence to fill 3,000 sheets of A4 paper,  if  the  data  was printed out.  

After  admitting  12  offences under the Computer Misuse  Act  1990  at  Bow Street  Magistrates  Court,  he was fined £1,200 and  ordered  to  pay  £250 costs.  The Act states that it is an offence to cause a computer to  perform any function with a view to securing unauthorised access.  

Mr  Geoffrey Robertson QC,  defending Pryce said that he had since given  up computing  as  he only got a D in his Computing Science A Levels,   and  was concentrating his studies at the Royal College of Music,  where he had won a scholarship to study the double bass and "is clearly destined to play  in  a leading English orchestra.".  

Since  Pryce was arrested,  he has been inundated with book and film  offers and  newspapers eager to tell his full story.  Pryce has refused  all  these offers, and wants to resume his quiet life.  

All this is like a real life version of the Hollywood movie "War Games",  in which a teenage hacker nearly started World War Three,  by breaking into the WOPR  (War  Operations Planned Response)  computer system at  the  US  Norad Computer Base.

SIR  -  For  almost  three  years  our family  has  been  living  through  a nightmare.  In May 1994,  when my son Richard was 16 years old,  there was a police  raid  on  our house.  A large number of officers removed  everything from Richard's bedroom while he huddled in shock in a corner.  This was  not a  raid for drugs or stolen property;  we were informed that he was "meeting undesirable characters over the Internet".  

We  were  not used to dealing with the police,  and believed them when  they said  that there was nothing to worry about,  and this would not affect  his future.  Three years later,  we have been through endless delays  and  court appearances and nobody seems to be able to resolve the situation.  

Richard  is  a  very  talented  double bass  player  who  last  year  won  a scholarship to the Royal College of Music.  I do not know how he is managing to  concentrate  on his studies.  It was not until 12 days  after  his  18th birthday  that  he was charged with unauthorised access to various  computer systems in the United States.  

This  meant  that  his  name could be released,  and  the  inevitable  press interest  began.  Since then,  the police and the Crown Prosecution  Service have spent vast sums of public money on this case,  including travelling  to the  United States on at least two occasions,  for several weeks each  time, trying to make out a case against him.  

Last year there was a report in the United States on the 250,000 attempts  a year  from  people to access the computers at the Pentagon.   Shortly  after that  report,  and more than two years after his arrest,  the  charges  were changed to "conspiracy",  and he had to face going to Crown Court instead of magistrates' court.  More delays followed.  On March 14,  those charges were rescinded.  

With  all  the rather nasty computer crimes that happen nowadays,  I  cannot understand  why  we  have been in the middle of this  ludicrous  and  almost surreal situation.  Richard will have a wonderful future in music,  if he is allowed.  

I  understand  that computer "hacking" has to be stopped.   But  surely  the United  States administration cannot believe that it will get good publicity from  insisting on this prosecution,  using Richard as an example to others. If  it  is  possible for a 16 year old,  with very ordinary  equipment,   to access their American system from his bedroom,  surely the fault lies in the system?  

Perhaps they should have asked where the fault lay,  rather than ruining  my son's life.
