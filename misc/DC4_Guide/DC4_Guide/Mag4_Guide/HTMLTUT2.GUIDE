This issue, I shall cover Pictures, Links and Special Characters. 
	----------------------------------------
 
@{"b"}Pictures@{"ub"}  

Including pictures is easy, just use the IMG tag like this: 
	<IMG SRC=name WIDTH=w HEIGHT=h ALIGN=align> 
'name' is the image filename. You can place quotation marks around the name, but you don't have to. Normally, you would specify a filename relative to the location (ie, drawer) of the current HTML file, eg, 'Images/Back.gif'. Note that if the filename has spaces in it, you must put quotation marks around it! 

'w' and 'h' are the width and height of the image respectively, and should be included so browsers know how much space to leave for the text. 'align' is how the image should be placed; there are five possibilities: 
    	
    Top - Place the image at the current text position, and continue the text after (ie, at the top of) the image. This is the default setting. 
    	
    Left - Place the image to the left. The text will continue on the right of the image. 
    	
    Right - Place the image to the right. The text will continue on the left. 
    	
    Center - Centre the image. The text will continue at the bottom of the image. Note the American spelling ('Center')! 
    	
    Bottom - Place the image at the current text position, and continue the text at the bottom of the image.  

Text is automatically wrapped around the images on the page.  

So what image format do you use? GIFs are the standard, although PNGs are becoming a replacement. JPEGS are useful for high compression, but take longer to display. Amiga web browsers support datatypes, so any format could be loaded with the right datatype; they usually also have internal loading for GIFs and JPEGs.  

@{"b"}Background Images, etc.@{"ub"}  

You can also use the BODY tag to define certain things: 
	 <BODY BACKGROUND=name WIDTH=w HEIGHT=h TEXT=text BGCOLOR=bg> 
'name' is the filename of an image which you wish to be tiled as the background on the page. 'w' and 'h', and the other rules mentioned above, apply as with other images. 

'text' and 'bg' are the colours of the Text and Background respectively. This should be entered in hexadecimal format in the form #RRGGBB, specifying the red, green and blue components. Eg, TEXT=#FF0000 would give the text in bright red. Again, note the American spelling of 'BGCOLOR'!  

@{"b"}Hypertext Links@{"ub"}  

This is where the real fun begins! To specify a link, we use this format: 
	 <A HREF=newlink>...hypertext... </A> The text between the  and  tags will be hypertext (indicated by blue and underlined). Clicking on this will take the user to the page 'newlink'. The link can again be relative to the current page, eg 'News.html' for a page in the same drawer, or you can specify a complete address. Note that this depends on where the pages are being viewed - when they are actually on the web, use the full web address (http:// etc). For local files, use the standard path name.  

Try it! Create this page:  

 <HTML>An example page! 
<P> <A HREF="newlink.html">Click me! </A> 
<P>Bye... </HTML>  

Save it as 'FirstPage.html', and then create another page, such as:  

 <HTML>Hello!!! </HTML>  

and save this as 'newlink.html' in the same directory. View the 'FirstPage.html' file in a Web browser - or Vision. Clicking on the hypertext will take you to the new page. Select 'Back' to return to the first page.  

@{"b"}Other File Types@{"ub"}  

Of course, hypertext can be used for much more. Supposing you wanted to make it so that a sample is played when the reader clicks on some hypertext, or maybe a picture is displayed. What about an MPEG movie?  

For this, we use the same process, but we specify the name of a sample, picture, etc, instead of the html document. A Web Browser will typically recognise the file type by the extension. How they are viewed / played depends on the browser, and many can be configured. Typical possibilities are: Internal viewing, Using an external program, or Saving to disk.  

Here are some typical extensions and what they represent.  


	Extension(s)	Filetype 
	html, htm	HTML file 
	doc, txt, asc	ASCII file* 
	gif, png, jpeg, jpg	Picture 
	mov	Quicktime Movie 
	mpeg, mpg	MPEG Movie   

* - A lot of browsers will load such a file as ASCII always, ignoring any HTML tags that there might be.  

Also note how browsers have to make allowances for the PC's 3 character file extension...  

@{"b"}Special Characters@{"ub"}  

Not all 'special effects' in HTML are done using < and >. When we want to print a special character onto the screen, we use the & symbol. For example, how do we print the character '<' onto the screen? We can't just type it in, otherwise the browser will think you are starting a new tag!  

We get round this by typing: 
	&lt;	@{"b"}NB:@{"ub"} That's lt as in LT, not it! 
And the < symbol will be printed. Here are some of the characters supported: 
    	
    &lt;- < 
    	
    &gt;- > 
    	
    &copy;- © 
    	
    &amp;- & 
In fact, that's how I've had to do it with this very document. Have a look, if you like - it gets very complicated when you get onto typing &amp;amp; to produce &amp;...

That's enough for this issue. Next time, I shall be moving onto Forms.
