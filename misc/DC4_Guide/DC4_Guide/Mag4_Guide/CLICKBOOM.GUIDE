@{"b"}ClickBOOM@{"ub"}'s Wish List  

You will have surely heard of ClickBoom's announcement to port  Myst (which should be well under way now), and now they have set up a conversion wish list, where you can vote for the games you want ported to the Amiga / PowerAmiga.  

It's on their web site at http://www.clickboom.com (1500 votes  on the first day!), and also appeared in CU Amiga recently. Get voting!  

My votes went to:  

@{"b"}Civilisation 2@{"ub"}, as the first was (is) my all time favourite game. There are very few things which make me wish for a PC, but one thing that would is Civ 2. Unless their was an Amiga port that is. Do it! Please ClickBOOM, @{"b"}Port It!!!@{"ub"}  

Er yes, next @{"b"}Quake@{"ub"}. It would run about 1 frame per second on my machine on a window 4x4 pixels large, but I think titles like this would be brilliant for PowerPC Amiga, ie, something to take advantage of the machine (even if it is -sigh- @{"i"}another@{"ui"} 1st Person Perspective game...)  

Lastly, @{"b"}Tomb Raider@{"ub"}. I think the idea of adventures with 3D rendered real time graphics is rather cool, rather than the normal old graphic adventures.
