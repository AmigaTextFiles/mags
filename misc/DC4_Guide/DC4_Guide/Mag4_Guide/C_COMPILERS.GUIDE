@{"b"}Which C Compiler?@{"ub"}  

Well, this isn't a comprehensive guide at all, as I haven't tried them all out, and only know a little C, but I thought I would give my opinions on what I have seen.  

GNU C is what I am using at the moment, and it works very well. The disadvantages? It's CLI based, and obviously a lot less  friendlier than something like StormC, but on the other hand, it's completely free! So bearing that in mind, how does it compare with other PD compilers?  

Well, I've only seen NorthC, which was pretty good. Note that GNU requires 4MB RAM (6MB recommended), and hard disk. NorthC is suited to 1MB Floppy systems. So if you've only got the latter, you've got no choice, but if you've got the requirements, then GNU is a lot better.  

Not only does it also do C++, there is also a version to compile to PowerPC (free with the Phase5 accelerators). It also claims to be very portable, that is, sticks to the official C/C++  language (unlike Lattice, so I've heard).  

I've tried a demo of StormC, and it is excellent. If you are serious about C programming (especially on a commercial level) then I'm sure it wold be a worthwhile purchase. But for the casual programmer, or someone just learning, I would say that GNU  is perfect for this.
