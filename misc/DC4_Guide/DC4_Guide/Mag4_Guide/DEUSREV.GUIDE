God is a Machine@{"ub"}  This demo starts off with some nice 2D lighting effects for the credits, before going into lots of 3D effects, with a few well drawn static pictures too.  

All the 3D effects are 2x2 resolution, but at least that means a fast frame rate. There's a voxel style landscape, a walking robot that looks rather like an ED-209, along with spinning cubes and stars and things. The lighting/shadow effects are done very nicely.  

There's a nice effect of a rotating cube where a laser cuts through, leaving a mark on the cube as it spins round.  

And the music's excellent! I always think decent music improves a demo no end.  

Highly recommended!
