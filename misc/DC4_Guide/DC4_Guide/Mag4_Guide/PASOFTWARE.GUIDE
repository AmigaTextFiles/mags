If you're worried that it's a bit short, remember this is only  the very beginning; software that is already available on PowerPC, or shortly will be. Phase 5 had about 250 developers commited to porting to PowerPC last time I looked, and let's face  it, any Amiga developers would be foolish to stick with 680x0 rather than moving to PPC. The likes of Wordworth, Final Writer, Lightwave, DOpus, Scala would be nice to see. And remember, Myst may be the only game listed currently, but we should see a lot more appearing, from ClickBOOM! and others.  

One thing I have wondered is if you will get both 680x0 and PPC versions together if you buy the product, especially if on CD  ROM. Kind of like the way you got the 2MB and 4MB versions with AB3DII. There should at least be a cheap upgrade opportunity - anyone know how this works on the Mac?

Interesting mix of native Amiga and Mac/PC programs there. One  thing I was wondering with programs like Lightwave and Pagestream, considering that there are native PowerMac versions, then hopefully they can be bothered to port to PowerAmiga! Especially Lightwave - who would spend over a grand on software, and then opt for '060s over 604s?
