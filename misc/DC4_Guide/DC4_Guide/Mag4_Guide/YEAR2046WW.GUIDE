@{"b"}Millenium-and-a-bit Bug!?@{"ub"}  

Okay, here's something for all of you with WordWorth to try...  Load up Wordworth, and then set your system clock to: 
	2046, 19 January, 03:14 
And then select the Wordworth screen. It will of course display 3:14 AM at the top of the screen, but wait a while, and it will mess up (something like 238:...). 

I hope Digita get on to it, they have less than 49 years to fix it!  

(I only know this works with Version 5 of WordWorth!)
