                     A bather whose clothing was strewed,
                     by breezes that left her quite nude,
                            Saw a man come along,
                         and, unless I'm quite wrong,
                      you expected this line to be lewd.

           When I woke up this morning, The dawn was soft and still
               A little Robin came and sat, Upon my window sill
      He tipped his head and looked at me, his eyes so bright and clear
           He chirped a little melody, My morning thoughts to cheer
             His song he sang so sweetly, Without a moments lull
           I gently closed the window, and crushed his #@*&! skull.

       There was a bird with a yellow bill perched upon my window sill.
     I lured him in with crumbs of bread then I squashed his little head.
   Oh me - oh my I'm such a klutz. I missed his head and squashed his nuts.

       Jack and Jill went up the hill, they each went up with a quarter
       Jill came down with fifty cents, they didn't go up for water...

           Jack and Jill went up the hill, To do some Hanky Panky.

                   Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard,
                      To get her poor daughter a dress.
                           But when she got there,
                            The cupboard was bare,
                      And so was her daughter, I guess!

                   In days of old,, When knights were old,
             And toilets weren't invented..., You left your load,
                  upon the road,, And walked away contented.

                            If I had your picture,
                            It would be very nice,
                           I'd hang it in my attic,
                           To scare away the mice!

                 One bright day in the middle of the night ,
                        Two dead boys got up to fight.
                     Back to back they faced each other,
                    Drew their swords and shot each other.
                      A deaf policeman heard the noise,
                      Came and found the two dead boys.
                   If youdon't believe this story is true,
                    Just ask the blind man he saw it too.

                           The fun began in Autumn,

                       Thrust his head beneath a train.
                       All were quite suprised to find,
                       How it broadened Willie's mind.
                        Willie on the railroad track,
                          the engine gave a squeal.

                          Now I lay me down to rest,
                       I pray I pass tommorrow's test.
                        If I should die before I wake,

                    Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis,
                  Isn't it frightfully good to have a dong.
                         It's swell to own a stiffy,
                          It's divine to own a dick.
                        From the tiniest little tadger
                        To the world's biggest prick.
                So three cheers for your Willy or John Thomas.
                   Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake.
                 Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend,
                           your Percy or your cock.
                        You can wrap it up in ribbons,
                        you can slip it in your sock.
                       But don't take it out in public
                      or they will stick you in the dock
                         And you won't a-come a-back.
                             A-thankyouverymuch.

                                  On Prices


"It's unwise to pay too much,  but it's worse to pay too little.  When you
pay  too much,  you lose a little money - that is all.  When you  pay  too
little,  you sometimes lose everything,  because the thing you bought  was
incapable  of  doing the thing it was bought to do.   The  common  law  of
business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot - it can't be
done.  If you deal with the lowest bidder, it is well to add something for
the  risk  you run,  and if you do that you will have enough  to  pay  for
something better."

                          John Ruskin (1819 - 1900)

                THREE RODENTS WITH DEFECTIVE VISUAL PERCEPTION

                      (To the tune of Three Blind Mice)

               Three rodents with defective visual perception,
               Three rodents with defective visual perception.

                       Visualize how they perambulate,
                       Visualize how they perambulate.

          They all perambulated after the agriculturalist's spouse,
           she severed their spinal columns with a kitchen utensil.

            Have you ever seen such a spectacle in your existence,
              as three rodents with defective visual perception?
