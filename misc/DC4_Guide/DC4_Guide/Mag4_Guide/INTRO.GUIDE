@{"b"}Introduction@{"ub"}  

@{"b"}Hello, and welcome to the fourth issue of DoubleClick!@{"ub"}  

Right, to explain: There are now @{"b"}two@{"ub"} versions of DoubleClick, a @{"b"}Full@{"ub"} version (also refered to as HTML), and  a @{"b"}Lite@{"ub"} version, which is in AmigaGuide format. Please read  the sections below, especially users of the Lite version, as some things in this mag won't work for them.  

@{"b"}Full (HTML) Version@{"ub"}  

From issue 4 onwards, this version is fully (well, I think) HTML compatible. This means that you can load it in to your favorite WebBrowser to view it! Just point it in the direction of Contents.html (or FirstPage.html, if you prefer), in the Mag4/ drawer.  

The existing viewer, Vision, will still be distributed with the mag, however, and I will generally be assuming that that's what people are using. There are a few things which are not possible in HTML, namely: 
    	
    You will miss out on the music completely, unless you do it manually yourself! 
    	
    You will miss out on any intro and outro pictures and anims that there are 
    	
    Aaargh! Voyager doesn't load IFFs, so a lot of the gfx in the mag won't appear (AWeb and IBrowse will do fine, however) 
    	
    Normal hypertext links to other pages and loading pictures, etc, should work fine, but things like loading programs from hypertext will very likely not work 
    	
    From issue 5 onwards, I hope to have secret articles which you need a password to decrypt and view. This will only be possible through Vision, and not through a Web browser 
    	
    Scrolling messages won't work. The message will be printed out in full on the screen 
    	
    And remember that Vision should work in 2MB RAM on floppies, where as existing browsers require 4MB RAM, hard disk and MUI/ClassAct  

Admittedly, the browsers are a lot faster at displaying the text, which is why you might want to view them using a browser. It's up to you, of course!  

The instructions for using this Full e-zine viewer (@{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/VISION.GUIDE/MAIN"} Vision) are giving in a @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/..MAGTOOLS/VISIONUSAGE.GUIDE/MAIN"} separate documentation file, but I'll explain the basics here anyway, it is very easy. To scroll, simply move the mouse to the very top or bottom of the screen, and move it in that direction, and the screen will automatically scroll. Any blue or white text is hypertext, and may be clicked on. Some pictures may form hypertext links too. Also, some areas may cause 'Information' boxes to pop up telling you briefly what will happen if you click on the word, picture, etc. There are also menu options which can be accessed with the standard right mouse technique. To return back to the previous hypertext link, simply select 'Back' from the Control menu. For example, you can go straight to the @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/NEWS.GUIDE/MAIN"} News menu from here.  

If you go to the @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/MUSIC.GUIDE/MAIN"} Music page, you can start some music. The Music menu gives a couple of options to stop or restart the music, to save you having to reload it.  

You need the OctaMedPlayer (supplied) in your C: directory. Check out the documentation if you are having trouble with it.  

@{"b"}Lite (AmigaGuide) Version@{"ub"}  From issue 4, DoubleClick! will also be available in AmigaGuide form. This will replace the older 'Lite' version of issues 1 to 3, which just wasn't really working. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, I have not produced this version, so it is difficult to say much about it, so check out the accompanying ReadMe, that should explain it all. Things I do know: 
    	
    You will be able to run from floppy, of course, but in this case, it may be that the pictures are unaccessable through the mag. When viewing on hard disk, you will be able to access all the pictures through AmigaGuide links 
    	
    A feeble attempt is made to make HTML Tables look readable, but it usually comes out messed up (the conversion is done by a program, not manually, you see!) 
    	
    Forms won't work. Copy it out instead! 
    	
    Secret articles for issue 5 present a problem - I will think about that one later! (See above) 
    	
    And other things, like scrolling messages, the music, etc   
	----------------------------------------
  

Note that although most images are stored as IFFs, there are some PNGs, (and a GIF too). You will need the relevant datatype to view these; a PNG datatype may be supplied with the mag; check  out the ReadMe documentation.  

	----------------------------------------
 Support for Future Issues!  

What's in future issues of this Diskmag, and when they get released depends on @{"b"}you@{"ub"}, the reader. The more letters, articles and so on that I receive, the sooner I can release the next issue, and the better it can be. Needless to say, this will be helped if more people see this mag, so please don't hesitate it to give it to your friends, send it to PD libraries, upload it to BBSs, etc. Remember: More support = More and Better Articles = Better Mag!

	----------------------------------------
 How Can I Get Earlier Issues?  

These may be available from some PD libraries, but instead, you can get them from @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/EDITORMARK.GUIDE/MAIN"} Mark or @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/EDITORSTEPHEN.GUIDE/MAIN"} Stephen. Cost is £1 for issues  1 and 2, and £1.20 for issue 3. Please specify what issue you want, and whether you want the Full or Lite version..  

@{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/SUBMISS.GUIDE/MAIN"} How to Submit Your Articles, etc!  

Read it, enjoy it, @{"b"}and write some of your own articles! @{"ub"}Any help I receive will be greatly appreciated.
