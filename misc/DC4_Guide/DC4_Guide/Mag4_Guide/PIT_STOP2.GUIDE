Cyclists could soon be forced to fit bells to their pedal bikes,
under a proposed new Government legislation. Labour's Road Safety
Minister, Lady Hayman, claimed she wants to make the bells on cycles
a compulsory item to help protect pedestrians. This has been classed
as "A matter of priority", although a Conservative Party spokesman
has dismissed the idea as ludicrous.

More people miss their cars more than their partners, it has been
claimed. The survey, commisioned by Green Flag, the breakdown
recovery company, state that over half of the drivers questioned said
they could not be without their car for more than a day. Only 10 per
cent said the couldn't do without their husband or wife.

Over 100,000 drivers who were breath tested last year, failed the

A car has been built for the man who has everything, including a price
on his head, by a British Security firm and Toyota.  The Toyota
Landcruiser Amazon looks externaly just like the normal £36,000 off
roader, but in reality it is a vehicle designed for transporting VIP's
who are the target of terrorists.  The £160,000 armoured car has
controls on the dashboard, marked 'Arm' and 'Fire', which controls the
smoke grenades, while Security specialists Scott Broder, has installed
transparent armour plating instead of glass.  The chassis of the car
is made from blast resistant metal, and the super reinforced fuel tank
can withstand a 10KG Semtek explosion at 3.5 metres.  In case of a gas
attack, the vehicle also has it's own air supply.

Millionaire Hugh Edeleanu is driving from John 'O Groats to Land's End
and trying to break his own speed record, in his Turbocharged JCB

Doncaster police offering him counselling with their Victim Support

An AA report has revealed that if you want to avoid a car crash, stay

breakdowns happen.  The safest day to travel is Sunday.

Italian car maker Alfa Romeo has been forced to recall more than 1,000

accidentally. All of the new 1.6 and 1.8 and many 2 litre models of
its 145 and 146 series are to be recalled, which is 1,302 in the UK
alone. The airbag could explode if the underside of the car is hit
hard, as there has been one case already.

Do you fancy owning a Ferrari for a week, or a Porsche for a month,
or even a Vauxhall Tigra for life?  Avis, the car rental company, is
running a competition that allows just that.  Everybody who hires a
car from them., and is over 30, will automatically be entered into the
competition.

In a desparate bid to cut down on 40,000 deaths every year, US road
safety groups want a legislation that forces parents to put children

In the US, high speed police car chases could soon case to happen. 
There is uproar over them as an average of 300 people are killed in

Jaguar has ceased production of its legendary V12 5.3 litre engine
after 26 years. The original unit was launched with 272 Brake
horsepower (BHP) in the E-Type in 1971. Today, their next generation
4 litre V8 engimne, as used in the new XK8 coupe, has more power - 290
BHP and it also has better economy.

To try and sell more models, Ford has now introduced leather interiors
in all Scorpios as standard, in an attempt to make the slow selling
model more appealing.

The Jaguar XK8 has broken all records with the company by outselling
any other sports car in the campany`s history.   5,500 coupes and
convertibles have been sold in the first four months of 1997.  Half of

sold in the UK.

will be releasing high performance versions of their S40 and V40
saloon and estate models in the autumn. The 150 mph T4 versions,

will do 0-60 mph in just about seven seconds. Prices for thre range
will start from just under #20,000.

Jeep, the US manufacturer, is recalling every right hand drive model
sold in the UK since their launch in January 1993.  There is a

Cherokee, which is on sale now, is not affected by the recall, as the
possible fault has been rectified.

however, hewanted to have a little fun, so he told his friends and

They duly granted his request, and set them permanently to expired!

In the USA, Peter Nunn`s petrol station has bebbed 171 times in four
years.  Peter, from New York, says that he has given up trying to call
the police each time he is robbed, as he is too embarrassed.  His
phone has also been stolen!

The little known supercar from Nissan, the Skyline GT-R, is finally to
be released in the UK.  The £50,000 supercar, which has a 2.6 litre,
24 valve engine and is blisteringly quick, capable of warp speed, will
be released after the London Motor Show in October.  Potential owners
will have to be quick, as only 100 will be available in the UK.  It
features include four wheel drive, electronic rear wheel steering, and
it has been called "one of the great driving experiences" by Nissan. 
It also holds the record for being the only production car to have
lapped the notorious German F1 track, the 14 mile Nurburgring in less

the USA recently.  It read "We have received a report that you may be
deceased.  Please come into our office with proof of identity and

Saab, the Swedish car maker, is recalling every car in its 900 series
as there are fears that the throttle may stick.  The recall will
probably affect 20,000 cars in the UK, leading to 170,000 worldwide. 
Saab stress that no accidents have occured, although 10 cases were
received in America.  The official word is that a build up of
corrosion on the throttle housing could lead to "unintended
acceleration."  Defective parts will be replaced with brass
components, which are non corrosive.  This ironically comes after
their recent newspaper advertising campaign in which the 900 set the
world endurance record by driving 25,000 at 140 mph.  The advert
stated "You'll never need to do it - but it's nice to know you can.".
