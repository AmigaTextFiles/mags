@{"b"}PowerPC - How Fast?!@{"ub"}  

So just how fast are PowerPC processors? Certainly far better than anything 680x0 and leaving Intel behind in the dust too!  

@{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/SPEEDS_MOTOROLA.PNG/MAIN"} 680x0 and PowerPC  

@{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/SPEEDS_INTEL.PNG/MAIN"} The lesser Intel Range  

Please not that speeds ratings (as always) are very approximate! These charts were constructed from MIPS ratings, or Specint95/Specfp95 where no MIPS ratings were available.  

The 300MHz 604e is there to show what soon could be available for Amigas! And the 75MHz 603e shows how even the slowest 603e beats the fastest 68060! Building any new Amigas using 680x0 and not PPC would surely be completely cost ineffective, being slower for a higher price!
