I  must  admit,  I am a bit of a Tetris addict,  and have played  many 
different versions of the game.  In fact,  when I play my Game Boy, it 
is  usually the first game in the slot,  with the legendary  Mr  Do  a 
close second. 
 
In  the  Amiga  I have played many different versions of this  Russian 
puzzler,  ranging from straight ports of the original,  to games using 
numbers,  and ones making words from the falling blocks. Nothing would 
prepare me for what I was about to play, however. 
 
Wormtris,  which is of excellent quality in all senses,  is  extremely 
playable  and  addictive.  Basically,  it is a merger  of  Tetris  and 
Worms,   which  has to be one of the best Amiga  Games  of  all  time, 
closely  followed by and of the Sensible stuff (Golf,  Soccer  and  of 
course Cannon Fodder 1 & 2). 
 
Some of the blocks are sheep,  which of course explode,  but there are 
also  a whole new range of blocks,  and trixks that can be used.  This 
is  more than a 5 minute game of Tetris while I am bored.  The longest 
I  have  played  a whole game,  without blowing my own  trumpet  (Parp 
Parp), is about 40 minutes. The game is that addictive. 
 
The sound effects are pure Worms,  with the Sheep, Revenge and Die, to 
name but a few. 
 
If  you  have never played Worms before,  then this will probably  not 
pull your chain,  but for true Worms addicts, myself included, it is a 
total anorak case. 
 
Unfortunately,  you have to supply the authors with 10  Dutch  Gilders 
for the registration fee.  Quite easy if you are Dutch, but not if you 
are like me (and you). 
 
Other than that, I cannot fault this game, except that it only has one 
highscore.  I would have preferred a table, so that you can see if you 
are  catching up on your friends highscore,  or vastly improving  your 
own.
