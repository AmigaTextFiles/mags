@{"b"}About Alien Abductions...@{"ub"}  

   
    	
    Surveys suggest that up to 5 percent of the population may be  Abductees, and abduction experiences seem to be far more common than UFO sightings 
    	
    Few people are abducted only once, instead they experience many throughout their lives. 
    	
    Almost all abduction experiences involve the aliens taking sperm or egg samples. In some cases, embryos are inserted into wombs, only to be removed at a later abduction. 
    	
    Many have claimed to see what seems to be odd-looking babies (Alien/Human hybrids, or just genetically altered babies?) in artificial wombs. Children have also been seen. 
    	
    In some cases, abductees have reported finding mysterious stains or sticky fluids on them, which evaporate very quickly. Samples have been available for testing, but so far no one has determined what they are made of. 
    	
    Some have expelled tiny metallic balls from their nasal passage; again, tests have not been able to determine their origin. 
    	
    There are many physical aftereffects noted by abductees, including: Scars and bruises; Vision problems; Muscle pain; Nosebleeds; Earaches; Discharges and vaginal problems; and even Pregnancy. The latter is when the woman becomes pregnant from an implanted embryo (which is later removed). 
    	
    The name Post-Abduction Syndrome (PAS) has been used to categorise the psychological symptoms that abductees suffer from.  Symptoms of PAS include: Sleep disturbances; Fears, anxieties and  depression; Missing time; and Psychosexual dysfunction.
