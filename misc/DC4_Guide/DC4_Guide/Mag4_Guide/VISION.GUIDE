Vision is the name that has now been given to the viewer which displays this DiskMag (the AGA/HD version, that is).  

It will soon be available separately as an e-zine creator, so anybody can use it to create magazines. I hope to release it as shareware, with a registration fee of around  £5 to  £10 (necessary  to release mags created with it). Please write to @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/ME.GUIDE/MAIN"} me if you are interested, or have any suggestions!  

@{"b"}Requirements@{"ub"} 
 
    	
    Workbench 3 at the moment, but I hope to make it compatible with Workbench 2. 
    	
    AGA is only required if you wish to use those modes in your mag. 
    	
    2MB Chip RAM recommended; I hope to reduce the memory requirements. 
    	
    Hard drive is recommended, but not essential. 
    	
    Datatypes supported; they are required for any file format you wish to use.  

@{"b"}Features@{"ub"} 
 
    	
    Uses language @{"b"}very@{"ub"} similar to HTML. 
    	
    Super smooth scrolling of screens. 
    	
    Supports AGA screen modes. 
    	
    True Hypertext system. 
    	
    Pictures in documents, automatic text flow, Tables support, Forms support, 'Information boxes', Scrolling messages, and loads more.  

@{"b"}Help!@{"ub"}  

I would like to appeal to anyone who may be able to help with the development of Vision. Write to @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/ME.GUIDE/MAIN"} me if you want to help. Needless to say, I will be willing to supply the source code if that is required. Areas I am having problems with... 
 
    	
    Colour Remapping. At the moment, all pictures must use the same palette. Anyone with experience in colour remapping? Actually, there seems to be a bug somewhere when two or more pictures are displayed; even with the same palettes, the colours change slightly. 
    	
    HTML Codes. I am trying to make Vision read as much HTML as possible, but I am limited in what I can find out, so any information would be greatly appreciated. In particular Tables, Frames, and anything I may have missed out. 
    	
    The Screen Modes requester is now working, but I have only tested it with PAL screen modes, so please let me know if there are any problems with NTSC/Monitors/Graphics cards. 
    	
    And of course, any other suggestions for improvements...
