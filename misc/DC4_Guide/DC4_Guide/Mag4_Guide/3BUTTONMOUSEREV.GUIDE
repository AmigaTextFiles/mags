@{"b"}Wizard 3-button Mouse review - by Alan Graham@{"ub"} 
 
The mouse - an important item of computing hardware, and one that is  
supplied with every Amiga since day one. The original Commodore rodent,  
which has been aesthetically remodelled several times but never  
fundamentally changed, is as reliable as a post-millennium PC.  There are  
plenty of third party mice (mouses?) available, but why choose this one? 
 
First of all, it has three buttons and although the standard OS has no middle  
button support, many programs can configure it to act like a shift key, run  
programs etc.  By using the excellent PD program Runbar, you can cause a  
Windows style "start" selector to open beside the pointer by clicking the  
middle button.  So, thumbs up for 3 buttons. 
 
Using it for the first time is a strange sensation, as its 560dpi mechanism has  
you whizzing from one side of the screen to the other, but you never need  
to reposition the mouse to reach the limits of the screen.  You soon learn  
that less is more, and can control it with ease.  The high resolution is evident  
on Workbench, but is in a league of its own in mouse controlled games such  
as Syndicate, Coala, Zeewolf and Virtual Karting.  Before buying this mouse, I  
would never have dreamed of preferring mouse control to joystick, but with  
the added control of an analogue device, it's a must. 
 
It would be unfair to say this mouse is perfect.  Its semi-circular boxy design  
is comfortable but a love-or-loathe thing (I love it) but it does come with  
about 5ft of cable and a choice of drab Amiga beige or sexy high-tech black.   
Its price is also slightly steep, at around the £15 mark, but this must be  
expected for high quality. 
 
If you are considering buying this mouse, it would be a good idea to get a  
decent mouse mat - one with a foam base and a semi-flexible top layer is  
best.  This should cost £5 tops, but makes all the difference to mouse  
performance and durability.  Don't use promotional freebies - these are  
usually of the one layer foam type which are not so good, but better than a  
bare table top. 
 
The Wizard is also Atari ST compatible (God knows what kind of computer  
that is!!!!). 
 
To sum up, I think that at £15, it is a bit expensive to buy just for the  
extra button and better resolution but, if your mouse is on the way out, and 
you would have to buy a new one this is the one to get.
