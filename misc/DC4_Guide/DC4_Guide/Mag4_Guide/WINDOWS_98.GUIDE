Windows 98 to be released in 1998 (Surprisingly!) 
 
Microsoft are due to release their latest Windows offspring,   Windows 
'98,  early next year.  The next generation of their software will  be 
designed to recieve both analogue and digital television signals,  and 
also  will have an option of an Internet TV guide,  allowing users  to 
watch TV on their computer. 
 
A  Web Browser will be used to navigate around the Internet,  and also 
the User's Hard Drive. 
 
They have also written a special release of Microsft Office 97,  which 
is  designed to run from a Network server computer,  which will  allow 
PC's with no hard drive to run the software.
