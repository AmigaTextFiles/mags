   Escom: The Commodore you never knew
  =====================================

The year is 1990. The Amiga 1200s and 4000s are selling like hot  cakes.  People
can't  get  enough of them. Commodore's range of PCs are doing extremely well in
Germany, and they are the envy of every computer company in town.

Then something happens...

Top people at Commodore start leaving. The truth is suddenly revealed, as Amiga
users watch on in dispair. Commodore USA goes into liquidation.  They got hit
hard, as America wasn't really a strong point for Amigas. Then one by one, other
Commodore HQs feel the pinch, and start dropping like flies. Who can save us
now?

Enter, Escom. Out of the blue, Escom makes the top bid  for  Commodore.  Who  is
Escom? And what are their motives? All will be revealed in this secret interview
that has just been uncovered by a leak...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For reasons of security, we are unable to show the interviewers face.

 Mr X    | Mr Man-Sells-Sh*t, do you admit to looking remarkably similar in
         | appearance to Richard on the show Good Morning, shown in Britain?
         |
 Manfred | Excuse me, it's Manfred Schmitt, not Man-Sells-Sh*t... And yes, I do
         | look remarkably similar in appearance to Richard on the show Good
         | Morning, shown in Britain.
         |
 MrX     | What were your motives for buying Commodore?
         |
 Manfred | I liked the look of the dainty 'chicken' logo, and I wanted it for my
         | own computer.
         |
 MrX     | We have had reports that you wanted the logo, so you could attract
         | more buyers, as the Commodore PCs were extremely successful in
         | Germany, and you wanted to cash in on the former  Commodore's 
         | success. You wanted people to gain trust in your company, by using
         | other peoples hard work. Do you realize sir, that selling something
         | that is not what it seems is called fraud?
         |
 Manfred | Ahh, yes, but the people of Germany knew of Commodore's demise, so
         | they understood that it wasn't the same Commodore they were dealing
         | with.
         |
 MrX     | If that's the case, sir, then why did you purchase the logo?
         |
 Manfred | As I said before, I liked it. I like the way the light sparkled on
         | its pointy edges, and glistened in the moon light.
         |
 MrX     | Right...
         |
 MrX     | So what did you think of the Amiga computer?
         |
 Manfred | Amiga? What's that?
         |
 MrX     | It was the product of the company you have purchased.
         |
 Manfred | Oh, that must have been a freebie thrown in with the logo. I thought
         | it was of no value, so I tried to sell it off to some fools calling
         | themselves VIScorp... But they didn't have as much pocket money as
         | me, so I am still looking for a buyer...
         |
 MrX     | Well thankyou for your time, Mr Sh*t.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ======================================
   VIScorp: The internet via television
  ======================================

Then VIScorp enters the scene. Suddenly there is a new sense of hope, that maybe
soon, the Amiga can once more be recognised as a machine with potential, and
make its users proud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Jerry   | Ahh Mr Bill Bile. please tell us about how you once planned to buy
         | the Amiga computer, and failed miserably.
         |
 Bill    | Well, there I was, looking remarkably handsome, telling these
         | desprately confused Amiga users how they could trust in VIScorp.
         | Yes, 'We have plans!', I said. We will sell the Amiga (In an
         | unrecognisable form). Just like the 'Intel Inside', our logo could be
         | the 'Amiga Inside'. We would sell this machine to everyone who has a
         | television. WE WILL DOMINATE THE EARTH!
         |
 Jerry   | But sir, I thought that the buzzword of 95 was 'multimedia', and the
         | buzzword of 96 is 'internet'. Who will buy this computer, when
         | already, thousands of homes are investing heavily on internet
         | connections?
         |
 Bill    | I'm not saying it will work, just that I like it...
         |
 Jerry   | What were your plans for the Amiga?
         |
 Bill    | Well, we decided that we would continue to sell it. But of course,
         | only second to our ED machine. Can we talk about ED now please?
         |
 Jerry   | Well, we are, after all, the ED is an Amiga...
         |
 Bill    | Who told you that!?!? How did this information get out? We are
         | trying our best to restrict companies like Phase 5 (It's just a
         | phase), and still it gets out? The public cannot know the ED is an
         | Amiga. It will seriously damage its sales, if the public know this!
         | You will have to be eliminated.
         |
 Jerry   | Did you know my last name is Adams?

  ======================================
   QuikPak: The lunch box manufacturers
  ======================================

With the demise of VIScorp, we have seen a number of companies interested in the
Amiga,  one  being  QuikPak.  Here  is  an  interview we have done recently with
QuikPak.

 Gary    | Hello Mr. Quik. I am interested in finding out what you intend to do
         | with the Amiga computer, if you manage to purchase it.
         |
 Quik    | Amiga? We have no plans for the Amiga, as far as I know.
         |
 Gary    | Then are you planning to do something with the technology?
         |
 Quik    | Yes, oh yes.  We have major plans. Just like VIScorp tried to sell
         | the technology to everyone who had a television, we are attempting to
         | go one step further. We are selling it to everyone.
         |
 Gary    | How do you hope to attempt to do that?
         |
 Quik    | By our unique range of portables.
         |
 Gary    | Ahh, you hope to develop the Amiga as a portable range of computers?
         |
 Quik    | Computers? I think you have been misinformed. We intend to develop
         | portable ready-made lunch boxes. Yes. Take it to work, take it to
         | school, or just have it at home, the QuikPak lunch pack is unbeatable
         | for value. It's quick, and handy for those moments when you haven't
         | time to prepare a proper lunch pack.
         |
 Gary    | Thank you Mr Quik, I hope your lunch boxes smell, i mean sell well.

    The MicroSoft® Legacy Continues...
  ======================================

    To boldly go where every man has been before...
    -----------------------------------------------

 Bill Gates has fulfilled the prime directive by releasing Windows ten years too
late. He is our leader (Or successor, we came before him).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We all know AmigaOS rulez and Windoof 95 sux, and MacOS, well, we can't say much
about  that.  But  what  really  annoys  me  is Micro$loth. Currently, I know of
nothing they have actually earned themselves. Back in the days of Spectrums  and
Commodore  64s,  Micro$loth  was  a  small  company, being bullied around by big
companies such as IBM. Micro$loth, the sloth that it is, decided to rip off  IBM
by  reverse engineering IBM's processors and put them in their own PCs they were
assembling. They also bought Q-DOG, renamed it MS-DOG and sold that  with  their
PCs,  which  through  no  fault  of  their own (we don't think) was in every way
identical to IBM's DOG they had with their PCs, except  for  the  drive  labels.
Then they proceeded to work on OS/2 for IBM.

Meanwhile... a steadily growing companing called Commodore had  released  a  fab
set  of  machines  called the Amiga. They had excellent graphics, and could do a
whole lot more to boot. Commodore also was working on Workbench, a cool  OS  for
the  Amiga.  It  could manage preemptive prioritized round-robin multitasking in
just 256k. It was so efficient, it could run off a floppy disk,  and  you  could
connect  it  up  to a number of televisions or monitors. It was superb for video
and sound work. It beat the pants off anything around at  the  time.  (PCs  were
still running green screens :)

Then Micro$loth steal part of the AmigaOS! In OS/2, Micro$loth 'decided' to  put
in  a  patented  copyrighted  feature  of Workbench. They stole the proportional
scroll gadgets that you and me take for granted. They didn't steal it  once  but
twice!  Micro$loth have also borrowed our lovely proportional scroll gadgets for
Windoze 95 too. Micro$loth then put in a whole new host  of  features  including
so-called  multitasking  and  a  32bit  operating  system.  Deja  vu?  Also, our
so-called friends, the BeBox owners have also managed to steal most parts of our
OS.  Hmmmm... This situation makes me laugh. When Windows 3.1 was out, PC owners
always claimed Amigas were rubbish and Windows was the best thing  since  sliced
pants.  Now  that  Windows  95 is out, they claim that Windows 3.1 was trash and
Amigas are still trash. Yet Windows 95 has only recently got some features  that
us  amigans  had  in Workbench about 12 years ago. The problem here is obviously
lack of advertising. Because they are made to beleive Amigas are crap, and  have
not experienced them for themselves and do not know the features Amigas rool in,
they are blinded by money-grabbing companies like MicroSlutt, so Billy  Boy  can
become an even richer turd.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We interview one of MicroSniff's hired workers to help sell PCs in major  stores
across the country. (This is an actors voice.  We are unable to reveal his
identity.)

 Us  | What sort of dirty tactics are used to shift PCs today?
     |
 MrX | Ohh very dirty tactics.  If Watchdog got a hold of this, the calls would
     |  blow up the switchboard. Here is an example of what I would say to
     |  `persuade' a customer.
     |
     | "£400 for a wordprocessor, anyone? No more features than any other
     | wordprocessor on other platforms, but don't forget, we at MicroSmell
     | give you quality assurance. We will even lie through our teeth to show
     | you that PCs are the best home computer around. We will `persuade' you to
     | take out insurance and buy guarantees, so if your PC ever breaks, we will
     | fix it for free (In your dreams). And we are not getting a massive bonus
     | for every customer we fool into getting this. Dirt cheap prices for
     | hardware. Fallen off the back of a lorry. Buy now, fork out November.
     | Windoze, the new operating system buy MicroSpoof. Many NEW features that
     | are available nowhere else. The hottest software event of the decade."
     |
 Us  | What is the main reason people buy PCs for today?
     |
 MrX | Ohh windows...  yeah...  The best operating system around they think.
     | And multimedia.  They are lead to beleive that PCs are actually good for
     | video and sound.
     |
 Us  | Does MicroSick know about this interview?
     |
 MrX | No way!  If they knew, I would be fired on the spot.
     |
 Us  | Thankyou for your time to reveal to us this ever deepening fraud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can't pull the wool over ours eyes Bill.

================================================================================

Bill Gates thinks he owns the world. MicroFool is the world. Thinks Bill  Gates.
In  his  book  "The Road Ahead" all the new technique is a creation that we will
have to thank Bill for. To each and every thing Bill discuss, about  the  future
world of computerized home environment, there's a product from MicrF--k. When he
writes about the advanced spreadsheets, MicroSink Excel is a  natural  reference
(????)...  not  for  me,  though. And the section where he describes his and his
family's future house, he just brags, no ordinary  person  can  effort  all  the
expensive  things,  like  dozens  of small TV-monitors with hyper sharp picture.
But, on the other hand, he has 100 millions to  spend,  so  why  not  do  it  on
rubbish  crap?  Spend  your  fortune  on trash, and realise that money isn't the
answer to everything... Yes, if you spend them on an  Amiga,  it's  alright  :-)
"But  it isn't profitable"; I can imagine Bill's answer. Bill sh*t, we say. Bill
has probably never touched an Amiga, and I don't think he has the  right  to  do
it.  Stay  in  the  PC  business, Bill, where boasting is allowed. We, all Amiga
owners, are too proud to deal with you... and we know that Amiga is  gonna  live
forever...

HOT NEWS!!!!

MICROSOFT BUYS THE AMIGA

Early this morning the deal was ready; Bill Gates' Microsoft buys the profitable
Amiga  computer  platform from VisCorp. A big thing in the history of computers.
Bill says, 'finally I have realised that if there's any computer that  is  going
to  get  yield  for  us,  it's  the  Amiga'. But everybody in the Microsoft head
quarters are not that glad as Bill. xxxxx says that Amiga has stolen a couple of
things  on  their  OS  from  the  PC's  OS, e.g. the multitasking that Microsoft
developed especially for their lastest OS Windows 95. (I wonder who  has  stolen
it from who?????). The line of computer business waits for the continuation.

We Amiga owners are glad  this  isn't  happening  in  the  reality,  aren't  we?
MicroSpoil  can't  buy  us,  'cause  we  aren't  for  sale,  in  any case not to
MicroFool...
