@{"b"}Car Stereos to shrink in size@{"ub"}  

The theft of car stereos, which is a major headache for both manufacturers and consumers alike, may soon be coming a stop, thanks to a system being developed by American computer giants, Microsoft.  

The stereo will be replaced by a miniature microcomputer that, not only will it play music, but will support GPS route planning, as well as access to the Internet.  

The activated system will run a new version of Microsoft`s current CE operating system, which is currently being used in hand held PC`s. Linked via a mobile phone, users will be able to have access to E- Mail, fax, route planning navigation software, and CD-Roms, via the on-board drive.  The mobile phone can be connected so that hands free conversation can be achieved, which will be a major bonus in the current climate, as police are trying to ban the use of hand held mobile phones in cars.  

A small screen will be built into the cars dashboard to display maps of the roads, and also a voice synthesizer will provide instructions to the driver, meaning that eyes need not be taken off of the road whilst driving.  

Speech recognition software can be used, so that the driver can respond to incoming E-Mail messages, and dictate to the computer as they drive.  

Using the on-board CD-Rom, maps of the UK & Europe can be used, along with the GPS satellite , so that the vehicles exact position can be pinpointed, to allow the computer to program the quickest route to the chosen destination. It is not known if the system will use the same system as other navigation aids, which  will take into account roadworks and blockages.  

The project, codenamed Apollo Project, has been under wraps so far, but is to be believed to have been active for at least six months.  

Daimler Benz and Ford have already been demonstrated the system, and hopes are that the system could be standard equipment on new cars in America and Europe within three years.  

Although Microsoft have not commented on this new product, sources say that cost would be around £750.  

Microsoft are also working on a hand-held computer, small enough to fit in a shirt pocket.  Codenamed Griffin, it will use the Windows CE operating System.  Microsoft have not announced if this project will be available.  

Hewlett Packard recently released the first hand-held PC in Britain, closely followed by Casio.  Both computers use the Windows CE system.  

Computer Analysts believe that the system will not get off the ground until later this year, when CE2 is released, which has support for colour screen graphics and a longer battery life.  It is also to be a part of the WebTV set-top computer, allowing users to surf the net using their TV sets as monitors.
