@{"b"}Writing Articles!@{"ub"}  

What's this? An article on how to write articles!? Well, I'm always saying how I want you readers to write in with articles, but you might be unsure as to what articles to write, where to start, or you might not be bothered to do it at all!  

Really, anything will do... 
    	
    Tutorials - Doesn't have to be a full blown teach yourself PowerPC assembler in ten minutes, or How to Write a Wipeout Clone. Maybe you've got some bit of source code that other people might benefit from seeing. Put a few comments in the code, write a little article to go with it explaining what it does, and giving a few pointers as to how it works, and send it in! And they don't have to be progging tutorials, either; anything computer related will do! 
    	
    Reviews - Come on, these are easy. Commercial or PD; game or application, we don't mind. And don't forget hardware too - it can be nice to get a different perpspective to standard magazine reviews. 
    	
    Views - Views on the Amiga situation or other stuff? Just tell us what you think! 
    	
    Reference / Information - Anything informative, doesn't even have to be computer related. Could be something you've compiled yourself, or found on a lonely Web site, either'll do.  

Writing a first article is always the hardest - what the hell do I write? Well just write something, and you'll soon find you have other ideas appearing. The more you write, the more ideas you get, I can tell you (but me and Stephen, we can't go on forever, that's why we need you to contribute!)  

I always keep a piece of paper, so if I have an idea for an article, but can't be bothered to write it just yet, I can leave it to another time without forgetting what it was.  

And don't worry about us rejecting an article, as we will publish it (as long as it isn't obscene, breaking laws, etc!)  

So stop reading this and load up your fave wordpro, and @{"b"}type!!!@{"ub"}
