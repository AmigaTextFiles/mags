You can now get read the latest issue of DoubleClick from the Bulletin Board Transmission Impossible. Even better, if you have any aricles/letters/contributions etc you want to appear in the mag, you can upload them here rather than sending them to me via or Stephen via post.  Here are the details...  

 
@{"b"}Transmission Impossible@{"ub"} 
Amiga / PC 
Huge File Sections 
Adult / Special Files - Must Ask Access 
 
Weekends @{"b"}ONLY - 10am-10pm@{"ub"}

So have a look if you can! Of course, my endless thanks go to Lee for doing this ;)  

@{"b"}Any BBS Sysops out there who want to put DoubleClick on their board, and maybe are willing to allow space for people to upload stuff for the mag? Write to me (Mark) or Stephen please.@{"ub"}
