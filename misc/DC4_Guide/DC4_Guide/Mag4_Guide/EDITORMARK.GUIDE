@{"b"}Doubleclick Issue 4 Editorial@{"ub"}  

Hello there!  

There's my address, so you've now got no excuse to write to me, but...  

@{"b"}Imminent Change of Address!@{"ub"} I'm of to University as of October '97, so obviously anything delivered to my home address will take a while for me to get hold of, and I haven't yet got a Uni address for you yet. Never mind, best thing is to send contributions to my co-editor, Stephen Graham (more about him later!) The good news is that I may be able to get an e-mail address with the University, so you may soon be able to contact me that way.  If you do write (to either of us), if you're sending money, please remember to state whether it's for DoubleClick! (and issues), or whatever, or we might get confused... If you're not sending money, and you want a reply, it's probably best to send an SAE (and disks, if relevant).  

As I said, I am now joined by Stephen as co-editor, so this of course means a bigger and better mag! It also means that if you have articles/letters/subscription money, you can send it to either of us. Check out his @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/EDITORSTEPHEN.GUIDE/MAIN"} Editorial, if you like.  

As well as articles, he's also supplied me with plenty of graphics, some of which are appearing in this issue. I should point out that the VistaPro render he mentions in his editorial is the title picture of the Contents page, but the original was a  nice 640x512 HAM8, but I had to reduce it to 320x256 with only 32  colours so it would fit on screen nicely, and more importantly, not take too long too load. 
	----------------------------------------
 Right, now an apology to all readers of issue 3. Due to, er, 'technical' difficulties, earlier incarnations of this issue had a few bugs. Okay, early versions had a lot of bugs! But over the weeks, they were slowly fixed, and hopefully this issue should be a lot better from the start (although I won't say that too confidently...) Anyway, if you haven't got a fixed copy of issue 3, you don't need to get it from me; just copy the 'Vision' file that is in the MagTools/ drawer with issue 4 to copy over the one in issue 3. If you haven't yet got them, you also need the four rexx files in there too, to control the music. Anyway, I hope you like it now that Vision's fixed! 
	----------------------------------------
 Again, I'm always keen to hear what you think about things, be it the mag, the Amiga, computing in general, or something else. When I say @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/SUBMISS.GUIDE/MAIN"} I want your articles, I'm not just on about highly technical tutorial type articles (although those are most welcome!), anything, including your views and opinions on the aforementioned topics, are welcome (not forgetting reviews, samples, modules, jokes, stories, adverts - with an aricle, penpals, and anything else you might care to mention... 
	----------------------------------------
 For those who care, I still intend to release @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/VISION.GUIDE/MAIN"} Vision as a standalone e-zine creator. I had to fix all those bugs, but it should be out soon. Actually, by the time you read this, it should be available! 
	----------------------------------------
 Yes indeedy, these are exciting times indeed! I mean, a few months ago, all we had was the prospect of A\BOX to be released in the future sometime, and possibly 'Amiga compatible' PIOS/pOS machines. With Quikpak turning our machines into high-end toasters...  

Now the move to PowerAmiga is here - and owned by a company with some money, who will hopefully do the Amiga some good for once! In the articles section, I've done four different articles condering the four main developments in Amiga future at the moment - Gateway 2000 / Amiga International; Phase 5; PIOS/ProDad; and Direct's PowerAmiga. So the Amiga's dead? I could be writing about how £2500 will buy you a QuikPak PC/Amiga machine with P150 and '060 (or worse still, how to get your Amiga software running under UAE on a PC). But I'm not.

 @{"b"}Amiga Graffiti?@{"ub"}  

There I was, doing my Economics exam, and there I cast my eye over the desk. Amongst the 'TF 4 AG' and 'Man Utd are Crap', I see, would you believe it: 'Amiga 1200's Rule, PCs are Crap'. Wahey! And as I looked around, I saw the entire desk (while, quite a bit of it) was sporting a PC vs Amiga debate. The level was not exactly high, with the only pro arguments being 'Rule', and the only anti arguments being 'are Crap'. It was about Digitiser level, actually. But it was reassuring as I scribbled a few supply and demand curves in the last five minutes, to glance over my paper and see 'Amiga Rules' staring back at me.  

Incidentally, someone had also written 'IBM Rule'. Is that a pro-PC comment, or anti-Windoze (considering OS2 Warp)? I should have created similar confusion by writing 'Gateway 2000 Rule'...  

But really, looking at it, I reckoned the Amiga people had written their comments first, as the PC comments were in response, so it shows how Amiga users like to shout out their beliefs. Could this be the start of a new craze? Sitting in a bog to see 'PPC 4 Amiga' scrawled on the cubicle, or maybe 'Hands off Viscorp, she's Gateway's now'. Maybe wandering in some alleyway to see a nice 'Intel Outside' logo spray-painted on the wall ;) 
	----------------------------------------
 Well anyway, back to the mag! You will notice that a few of the graphics in this mag are in PNG format, so you'll need a PNG datatype to view them. Sorry, and also sorry for the longer loading time, but IFFs take up about 10 times the space (well, a bit more, anyway), so there's less room for text. Less room for the likes of me to waffle on and on about nothing in particular reallly, like right now in fact...  

Don't worry, I'll keep speedy IFFs for most of piccys in the mag, and just reserve PNGs for one-off loading screens, and ending screen. 
	----------------------------------------
 Thanks to Lee Bates, you can now read the latest DoubleClick issue from his Bulletin Board, @{" " link "DC4_Guide1:Mag4_Guide/TI_BBS.GUIDE/MAIN"} Transmission  Impossible, and also upload articles, etc, there. Hopefully this will mean more readers, more articles... If you can't be bothered to send articles by post, but you have a modem, you've got no excuse now, have you? 
	----------------------------------------
 I'm still struggling with ShapeShifter, but I should be there soon. As there didn't seem to be any Mac programs that split files up, I did it via SoftWindows on a Mac to run a PC program (!) that did the job (called Split). I joined the Install disk with Join happily on the Amiga nicely, except, would you believe it, the disk with a chunk of Disk Tools (which I need first) was suddenly corrupted! Arrgh! I shall return to get another copy someday, no doubt. By the way, this Split program is cool - It may be a PC program running via emulation on a Mac, but that doesn't stop it from printing out 'Amiga is the BEST' every time your run it!  

It was also rather interesting that the Mac I was using (my friend's, Steph) seemed to have trouble saving to PC disks, and that had to be done from the emulation. The Mac kept saying that the disk was full, which it wasn't. Any ideas? - I will pass them  to Steph. And does anyone know if you can copy programs from a Mac CD to the Mac filedisk on the Amiga side? Will this work as an easy way to get Mac programs? Please write if you can help!  

Talking of Macs, Steph tells me that MacOS 8 was released yesterday (Tue 22 July). So what does this mean for us miggy users, then? Well, this is the first Mac OS/System which is written entirely in native PPC code, previously it was mainly emulated 680x0 (without even a real 680x0 CPU to do it!) That's a few years (3?) after the first PowerMac was released. But even so, that didn't stop all those Mac users upgrading to PPC, and Apple discontinuing 680x0 Macs. So just because there isn't a nice AmigaOS port to PPC just yet, that shouldn't put us off too much, just as long as there are some nice programs to run on it!
