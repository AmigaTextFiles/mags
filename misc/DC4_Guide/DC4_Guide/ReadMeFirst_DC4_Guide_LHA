@node MAIN "DoubleClick! Issue 4 (lha Archive)"

What you have here is the new AmigaGuide version of DoubleClick, for those who can't run the full/HTML version, or just prefer the Guide version (being quicker, etc). Of course, many things cannot be supported, so sorry if some things mess up; all the text is there.

If you are reading this, then you have already dearchived the program! Note that you must run this from hard drive - the disk distributable runs from floppy, but the lha version does not.

Just click on the 'runme' icon to get started. Note that an Assign on DC4_Guide1: will be added automatically when you run this.

Please note that you need a png and gif datatype for some of the graphics (though most are iff).

Other things to note...

Pictures are given a link so they can be viewed separately. Tables come out a bit awkward. Scrolly messages and such obviously don't work.

Music can't be played from amigaguide, but the three modules are provided anyway.

@{"b"}How to use:@{"ub"} This is an AmigaGuide, what more do you need to know? Select 'Help' if in doubt.

Okay, that's all the boring stuff, so get on and enjoy the mag!
