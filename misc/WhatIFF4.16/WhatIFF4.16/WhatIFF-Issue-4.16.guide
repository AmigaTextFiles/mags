=============================================================================

Welcome to the April issue, our first issue of 2025, of WhatIFF?, since our
last issue in December 2024 the Amiga scene has moved quickly such as the
the announcement of the Amiga 1200NG by AmigaKit and more new games and
updates to big sellers such as RogueCraft. In this issue though we 
concentrate on the hardware and software reviews such as the Tikus USB 
adapater, AKUA Amiga keyboard adapter, OpenPSX2Amiga adapter, the updated
TechnoSound Turbo sampler and the English edition of the AmigaOS3.2 
reference manual.

We are also privileged to have interviews with Paul Vince of AGS, who has
also kindly included all the back issues of WhatIFF? with the latest update
of AGS. SOLAS creator Rob Cranley also talks to us about hit project and
Timothy Deters gives us a quick update on FinalWriter.

We have the usual guides for using graphics software such as the DigiPaint
basics and how to connect to BBS in 2025 without a modem. Roald Strauss has
written a fascinating piece about pixel art and Martyn Bampton writes about
his experience with DELL monitors. John Scolieri continues his excellent
series on the PiStorm with another guide on upgrading a PiStorm 32 to a
Pi-CM4 model.

Also this will sadly be my last issue as editor, due to an increase in work,
lack of time and funds I am handing the reigns over to Bill Panagouleas. It 
has been an incredible experience working on WhatIFF?. When I started the
magazine back in 2021, I was not sure how long it would last, there was much
I still had to learn and as you can see from the first issues it was quite
barebone compared to now. Communicating with all the writers and contacting
people for interviewing has given me a new appreciation for the hard work 
that each person puts into this "hobby" computer. It is also incredibly 
humbling to have them share their knowledge and experience in the magazine.

I have made some amazing friendships along the way and aim to keep in 
contact even though I will not be managing the magazine anymore.

Thank you Steve, John, Andy, Martyn, Ivan, Roald, and Rob, you guys have 
done an amazing job each issue and have put up with my badgering for a
new article as each issue nears release.

I am looking forward to magazine continuing its growth under the leadership 
of Bill and hope to still contribute when I can. Finally, thank you to all
who have taken the time to download and read WhatIFF?, it has been a 
pleasure reading your e-mails and hearing your comments.

Amiga forever!

@{b}A Few Words From The New Editor@{ub} - by: @{"Bill Panagouleas" link billpanagouleas}
=============================================================================

I still remember the first announcement of WhatIFF? four years ago. I was 
excited to see a new online Amiga focused magazine and one unique thing 
about it was that it was available in the AmigaGuide format. I read each 
issue that came out after the launch with interest on what products were 
covered and what news was discussed. I always found WhatIFF? to be a well 
designed and exciting fan based online publication. I have had a keen
interest in reading and enjoying Amiga publications for many years and was 
a regular published reviewer in Amazing Computing Magazine. Since I'm in the 
industry, I see and appreciate the hard work Timo has put into WhatIFF? with 
his team. WhatIFF? has grown and matured with each fun issue. 

Also, it's awesome that Timo lives in Japan! I'm stuck living in the Chicago 
Suburbs, Japan sounds way more exciting. I'm honored to continue guiding the 
direction WhatIFF? takes and publishing each issue four times per year. Timo 
is currently busy with life and other projects. We can continue to build 
WhatIFF? into something he will still enjoy and contribute to sometimes. I 
look forward to work with the great writing/creative team Timo has put 
together so we can release more exciting quarterly issues of WhatIFF? for 
Amiga fans. It's an honor to work on this project.

Best regards Bill Panagouleas

Do we need a better system to keep Amiga sellers to account? The Amiga has
grown in popularity over the years and along with newer users has come 
higher prices, more demand and new resellers. However as a consequence of 
that the quality of the Amiga merchants has been ... wanting, for lack of a 
nicer word.

It seems quite common now to see people posting on forums about delays, 
undelivered items, lack of communication, and badly built products. Then the 
hoops we have to jump through just to get a refund. Sadly this has seemed to
affected some of the bigger and more established Amiga shops. This was not
an issue in the earlier days when the Amiga was still just a faded memory 
for most people.

There are more ways to buy Amiga gear but less reputable sellers, I recently
paid for a set of OS3.2.2 roms from RetroFletch, after no communication I 
contacted PayPal and then got a response from the guy. After some back and
forth I thought I would give him another chance and reversed the claim. Well
after that came silence, excuses such as having a migraine and then needing
to check the office. Suffice to say nothing was sent and no communication 
was forthcoming afterwards. It was my fault for having given him a second
chance but I always want to believe the best in people and the Amiga.

Unfortunately this is not the exception, in today's Amiga market, you have
to be very careful when you buy Amiga gear. So, this brings up my orginal
thought. Is it time to have a registered and reviewed list of Amiga shops
where all shops can be listed and customers can give their ratings and
experiences, instead of having every experience spread across various 
forums and websites. It is a shame that the Amiga scene has come to this
as it also affects those Amiga shops that provide fantastic service and
communication. And communication is probably the key, as most complaints I
see are from a lack of simple back and forth between the seller and buyer.


I hate to call out companies and perhaps it was not best of me to name one
Amiga seller out of so many but it is also good to warn people to be careful
when spending their hard earned cash. The Amiga is an expensive hobby and 
only getting more so. Not all of us have jobs that pay well but still want
to enjoy the orginal Amiga experience.

So, be careful out there, the Amiga has become a more unsecure place to
buy goods but also thank you to the Amiga shops that are providing quality 
service and communication.

An Amiga keyboard and a USB device to use it with.  Adapters are 
available for:
* A1000 external keyboard (4P4C).
* A2000/A3000 external keyboard (5 pin DIN).
* A4000/CD32 external keyboard (6 pin mini DIN).

                @{IMG "Images/akua_keyboard_01sm.iff"}
@{b}Introduction@{ub}

While I was in the middle of restoring my A2000 and A4000 I noticed the 
cable was pinched on my A4000's keyboard.  It would probably be fine but 
I wanted to test it first before causing any damage, a multimeter showed 
it was okay but you never know!  I had a look around the various Amiga 
Websites to see if there was something to interface an external Amiga 
keyboard to USB. While I saw a lot of adapters to achieve the opposite 
(USB keyboard to Amiga) I did also find this adapter.  It's made and 
sold by Alinea Computer using firmware from tkoecker.  Admittedly it 
would be a bit expensive to buy the AKUA simply for one test so I 
thought it would be great to use my Amiga 4000 keyboard with my 
workstation or A500 Mini afterwards.  It's another really interesting 
use of an Arduino ("Pro Micro" Arduino clone), taking the Amiga keyboard 
signals and converting them to the USB HID standard.  One point is the 
keyboard must have it's own onboard controller so A1200 and A600 
keyboards won't work as their controllers are on the motherboard. You 
should be able to use the AKUA with any USB HID compatible computer or 
OS, Raspberry Pi, FPGA (V4SA/MiniMig/MiSTer), or emulator.
                @{"AKUA Keyboard Image 2" link Images/akua_keyboard_02big.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/akua_keyboard_02sm.iff"}
@{b}Impressions and Use@{ub}

I chose the version for the A4000 keyboard and it arrived in a labelled 
antistatic bag as part of a larger order.  Included is a short (20 cm) 
USB C cable and a white 3D printed case in which the AKUA is installed - 
black is also available if you prefer.  I was pleased to see the cable 
was USB C and detachable so you can use one of appropriate length for 
your needs.  The 6.5 CM (L) x 2.8 CM (W) x 2 CM (H) case is a higher 
quality two piece print, there's no give or rattling with everything 
fitting neatly.

Using the adapter is as easy as using any other USB keyboard, just plug 
your keyboard in and then plug the adapter into your chosen device.  A 
bright LED illuminates the interior of the case making the most of the 
unit glow, I find this is common with these cases and it's up to 
personal taste if that's good or not.  The main keys are mapped directly 
key to key and the rest in a way that makes sense, for instance the Help 
key is mapped to Page Up and the Amiga keys are mapped to the Windows or 
Command keys.  For the most part it all works as expected, the only 
niggle I had was the the caps lock responsiveness with it needing an 
on/off toggle sometimes. Both of my keyboards worked without issues so I 
was happy about that.  Included on all adapter versions is a pin header 
for A500 internal keyboards.  You could use the bare adapter inside an 
original or A1200.net case to connect a real Amiga 500 keyboard to a 
Raspberry Pi or FPGA board.  This is a welcome inclusion.
                @{"AKUA Keyboard Image 3" link Images/akua_keyboard_03big.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/akua_keyboard_03sm.iff"}
I chose the A4000 version of the adapter because I expect the A2000 to 
be more repairable and its keyboard cable is undamaged - but also 
because I have a female DIN to male mini DIN adapter and the A2000 
keyboard should work using that.  For me it did which is another plus, 
the reverse may also be true if you wanted to use an A4000 keyboard on 
the A2000 AKUA via an adapter but I was unable to test that.

@{b}Summary@{ub}

If you want to connect an Amiga keyboard to a device over USB then this 
is an excellent option.  It's well built, looks tidy and simply works.  
The inclusion of the A500 keyboard header is more than a bonus, it could 
be the reason for buying the adapter in the first place - even if the 
AKUA is intended for external keyboards.  Both of my keyboards worked 
including the A2000 via a DIN adapter, a relief given how original Amiga 
external keyboards are stupidly expensive - nice one indeed!

@{b}Pros and Cons@{ub}

+ Well designed and simple to use.
+ Several versions.
+ Possible to use one adapter for multiple keyboard types (A500 or using 
  DIN to mini DIN).
+ Price competitive with other adapters.
- None really, the LED glow if you don't like it?

Other Key Points:
* A1200 and A600 keyboards are not supported as they lack a controller, 
  however the main focus of the AKUA is external keyboards.

                @{IMG "Images/openpsxadapter1_sm.iff"}
@{b}Introduction@{ub}

I've often heard that a) the best controllers made were the earlier 
PlayStation controllers - and b) that the CD32 controllers weren't all 
that great to use.  I never found them that bad in truth but I'm 
probably more used to my Competition Pro joysticks and "Honey Bee" CD32 
controllers. Perhaps that says something.  However, when I saw this open 
source project I absolutely wanted to see if PlayStation controllers are 
any good when used with a CD32.  The appropriately named OpenPSX2Amiga 
lets you use a PS1 or PS2 controller with an Amiga as well as other 
Commodore computers.  I found a seller on eBay and ordered a few 
adapters based on the project and waited for them to arrive.  Not very 
patiently...
                @{"PSX2Amiga Adapter Image 2" link Images/openpsxadapter2_big.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/openpsxadapter2_sm.iff"}
@{b}Impressions and Use@{ub}

The adapters eventually arrived, packaged securely in a box with bubble 
wrap and inside an antistatic bag.  The PCBs are mounted inside nice 3D 
printed enclosures.  There's certainly a theme here, open source adapter 
project using an Arduino or similar microcontroller, PCB, 3D printed 
case, it's a great time to be a builder.  It's a chunky feeling adapter at
8 CM (L) x 4.8 CM (W) x 2 CM (H) but the PlayStation controller connector is
quite wide.  It's been  designed to accommodate the connector without
putting it on a short  cable which I think is neater and feels more solid 
and secure.  The adapter did take up a fair amount of room at the back of 
my Amiga and I had to remove one of the retaining thumb screws from my 
floppy drive connector to get everything to fit.  It has been designed with 
a bit of clearance for floppy connectors but watch out for that if you're 
using the floppy port.  If you want to use two of these then you will need 
an extension cable for at least one of them, two won't fit side by side 
directly.  The adapter has two LEDs to indicate power and operating 
mode, mine are red and green respectively.
                @{"PSX2Amiga Adapter Image 3" link Images/openpsxadapter3_big.iff/MAIN}

                @{IMG "Images/openpsxadapter4_sm.iff"}
It really is plug and play, after powering on the adapter glowed bright 
red and the analogue button on the PS controller was lit.  I enjoyed a 
few games and found I could use the D-pad and left analogue stick 
interchangeably, or turn off the sticks using the Analogue button as 
expected.  In the standard mapping button 1 (fire) is mapped to square 
and button 2 is mapped to X, however you can access other mappings with 
the adapter's second LED blinking to confirm your selection:

Standard Mapping (accessed with Select + Square, 1 blink):
* D-pad and Left Analogue work as direction buttons.
* Square is Button 1 and X is Button 2.

Racing Mapping 1 (accessed with Select + Triangle, 2 blinks):
* Accelerate and brake mapped to Square and X.
* Left Analogue used to steer, vertical axis is ignored.
* Triangle is Button 1 and Circle is Button 2.

Racing Mapping 2 (accessed with Select + Circle, 3 blinks):
* R2 (or R1) to accelerate and L2 (or L1) to brake.
* Button 1 is mapped to Square.
* Steering and the D-pad work as in Racing Mode 1.

Platform Mapping (accessed with Select + X, 4 blinks):
* D-pad and Left Analogue work as direction buttons.
* X is Button 1 (jump), Triangle is Button 2

You can add custom mappings if you like (details on the project page) 
and there are more modes.

Mouse Mode:
Use the right stick for mouse mode, it'll activate automatically to 
provide a basic mouse if you needed one, the second LED will blink 
continuously when mouse mode is active.  Cancel by pressing any D-pad 
button.  It's useful to have and saves quickly plugging in a mouse while 
the computer is on (we used to do that? Yikes!) but I've often activated 
it by accident which can be annoying.

C64 Mode:
Swaps some signal levels around for button 2, toggle by pressing Select 
+ Start.  The second LED will flash once when activated and twice when 
deactivated.

CD32 Mode:
This is activated automatically when the adapter is plugged into a 
CD32.  It maps all 7 buttons of the original CD32 controller and the 
D-pad and Left Analogue work for direction.  The second LED will light 
up steadily.

Buttons are mapped as follows:
* Square to Red.
* X to Blue.
* Circle to Yellow.
* Triangle to Green.
* L1/L2/L3 to Left.
* R1/R2/R3: Right.
* Start to Start/Pause.

Pressing Select will rotate the 4 main buttons:
* X to Red.
* Circle to Blue.
* Triangle to Yellow.
* Square to Green.

@{b}Summary@{ub}

If you have a PS 1 or 2 controller and an Amiga then this is worth it.  
I successfully used a SCPH-1200 controller with Xenon 2, Seek and 
Destroy, Alien Breed: Tower Assault, Wing Commander, Zeewolf and Zool to 
name a few games.  Is it any good?  Yes!  It works very well indeed and 
felt very smooth and comfortable.  However there's no rumble (it would 
need power and game support), the left analogue stick is mapped to work 
as the D-pad (digital) and you could have issues physically attaching 
the adapter in some situations.  As a side note - it seems it's common 
practice to use screws to keep the DB9 shield in place.  This put 
too much stress on the ground connectors, twisting them out of the PCB 
and preventing the case from closing properly.  I understand this was 
probably for clearance reasons so I'm going to repair them using nuts 
and countersunk bolts.  I'm very happy with the OpenPSX2AmigaPad 
and I'll be using it often, it was worth taking a look.

@{b}Pros and Cons@{ub}

+ No configuration needed, it works out of the box.
+ Lots of modes plus add your own custom mappings!
+ Mouse mode to avoid hot swapping mice/joypads.
+ Nicely designed with integrated PS controller connector and some 
  consideration given to neighbouring connectors.
+ Project page provides good documentation.
+ CD32 automapping.
- Won't fit the A600 as-is, you'll need a joystick extension cord for 
  either port.
- Like other adapters you may not like how brightly the LED glows.

Other Key Points:
* Most PlayStation 1 and 2 controllers seem to be supported including 
  wireless but do check the compatibility list.
* External floppy drive connectors and the adapter may not fit properly 
  together.
* Two adapters won't fit at the same time.

                @{IMG "Images/ami-rgb2vga_ultimate_02sm.iff"}
The Amiga was designed when bandwidth limited analogue CRT displays 
were the norm.  Any harmonic frequencies generated by the Amiga's 
circuitry which were present in the RGB output couldn't be displayed by 
those monitors.  Essentially the troublesome frequencies were "filtered" 
by hardware limitations.  Newer LCD monitors are not so limited and can 
accept much higher bandwidths - they can indeed display these 
frequencies on their analogue inputs when using an RGB to VGA adapter.  
This is seen as vertical banding or lines on the screen, often called 
"jail bars".  This is perhaps another reason to use an upscaler or 
flickerfixer but if you have a 15 kHz capable monitor and just want to 
use RGB on the VGA port then the output will need filtering to reduce 
the vertical lines. Thankfully such filters or "Vertical Line Removers" 
(VLR) do exist, such as the configurable AMI-RGB2VGA Ultimate.  I 
thought I'd compare this adapter to a cheaper buffered RGB to VGA 
adapter from AMIGAStore.eu as well as my original Commodore 390682-01 
Sync Dongle included with my A4000.

The adapter was packaged in an antistatic bag, everything was soldered 
correctly and it felt sturdy.  There was no case included but there are 
3D files available so I had some printed.  There may be slight sizing 
variations as they almost but didn't quite fit correctly causing the 
clips to break - a bit of tape and they'll work for now.  Perhaps the 
case was designed for a previous version of the adapter and not this 
version (3.1).  Its dimensions with the case are: 

6 CM (L) x 4.5 CM (W) x 2.2 CM (H)

and it looks great in purple as most PCBs do but that's purely down to 
taste.
                @{"AMI RGB2VGA Ultimate Image 4" link Images/ami-rgb2vga_ultimate_04big.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/ami-rgb2vga_ultimate_04sm.iff"}
The adapter plugged snugly between the RGB port and the VGA cable, the 
DB23 connector is placed with the PCB between its pins while VGA port is 
soldered on top.  This was a bonus for me as it meant the VGA connector 
cleared my monitor stand base thanks to the added height.  The project 
page is very comprehensive and explains the vertical line problem and 
the solution in detail and how the adapter filters the troublesome 
frequencies.  A table is included on the bottom of the PCB to detail the 
DIP switch positions for frequency filter selection:

+-----+-----+-----+------------+
|  1  |  2  |  3  |  Option    |
+-----+-----+-----+------------+
|  x  |  x  | OFF | No Filter  |
+-----+-----+-----+------------+
| ON  | ON  | ON  | SD 9.5 MHz |
+-----+-----+-----+------------+
| OFF | ON  | ON  | ED 18 MHz  |
+-----+-----+-----+------------+
| ON  | OFF | ON  | HD 36 MHz  |
+-----+-----+-----+------------+
| OFF | OFF | ON  | FHD 72 MHz |
+-----+-----+-----+------------+

Switch 3 turns the filter on or off regardless of the positions of the 
switches 1 and 2.  Switches 1 and 2 give you four filter options from 9.5 
MHz to 72 MHz.  There's also a separate switch for replacing the 
horizontal synchronisation signal with the composite synchronisation 
signal.  More details can be found on the project page:

I tried each adapter in turn in 15 kHz game modes and on a DBLPAL 31 kHz 
Workbench screen, I also tested each filter setting of the AMI-RGB2VGA.  
I used a Dell P2414Hb monitor in an Amiga 1200 for these tests and noted 
the visibility/intensity of any vertical lines present.  Please note 
these results are not very scientific and they're certainly specific to 
my set up, however they should provide a general indication of how these 
adapters perform.

The cheaper adapter certainly showed the most vertical lines, however 
it's a simple cost effective buffered adapter and makes no claims of 
filtering.  What surprised me was how well the original Commodore 
adapter performed.  Then again it was intended for use with a multiscan 
or VGA monitor with 15 kHz and/or 31 kHz screenmodes and AGA output.  
The AMI-RGB2VGA Ultimate did very well at 15 kHz with the 9.5 MHz and 18 
MHz filters, however it didn't completely eliminate the lines and the 9.5 
MHz filtering resulted in blurry 31 kHz output.  This is unavoidable as
filtering 9.5 MHz at 31 kHz will cut sharp edges other than just bars.  
However, it is possible  to achieve a line-reduced 31 kHz output with the 
18 MHz filter and some settings, adjustments and patience.  Using the 
adapter on an A500 and A600 for games and 15 kHz Workbench modes was 
straightforward and produced noticeably better results with the 9.5 MHz 
filter. I settled on the 18 MHz filter for acceptable results in 15 kHz and 
31 kHz.

                @{IMG "Images/ami-rgb2vga_ultimate_07sm.iff"}

@{b}Summary@{ub}

The AMI-RGB2VGA Ultimate might not completely remove vertical lines in 
all situations but it does noticeably reduce them.  The adapter is 
compact and well built and while it doesn't come with a case there are 
files available to 3D print one which mostly fits the V3.1 PCB.  The 
adapter works brilliantly at 15 kHz but was less effective for 31 kHz 
Workbench modes in my testing.  Overall this is a capable and well 
designed RGB to VGA adapter and the price is reasonable when you 
consider the selectable vertical line filtering (and the price of a 
Commodore Sync Dongle).  Very effective in a 15 kHz set up.

@{b}Pros and Cons@{ub}

+ Very nice build quality.
+ Reduces vertical lines considerably at 15 kHz.
+ Buffered.
+ Selectable frequency filtering.
+ Purple!
- Less effective at frequencies higher than 15 kHz.
- No case option as sold but you can print one.

Other Key Points:

* There's a huge variety in monitors, computers and cables, results may 
  vary but are generally positive.

@{b}Introduction@{ub}

I'm glad I have some original Amiga mice, however I found the novelty of 
using them for any length of time wore off very quickly. While I do love 
the design and they bring back memories I'd rather not use wired ball 
mice when wireless optical mice are an option - as much as picking dirt 
and dust out of the rollers was fun.  The Tikus (apparently it means 
mouse or rat) is a small adapter with a DB9 plug on one end and a USB 
port on the other.  Like any other USB mouse/joypad to Amiga adapter 
just plug your device's USB cable (or wireless receiver) into the USB 
port and then plug the Tikus into your computer.  With Amiga OS 3.2 and 
the Tank Mouse driver you can get scroll wheel (mouse wheel) support in 
Workbench which is brilliant!  Earlier Amiga OS users can use the 
Freewheel app.  As the name suggests you can also use "some" digital USB 
joypads with the Tikus although support is not as good as for USB HID 
mice.  I thought this was a great feature so I wanted to try it with my 
joysticks and joypads.

Note: There is a version of the Tikus included with the new wireless 
Tank Mouse, this version is for mice only and won't work with joypads.
                @{"TIKUS Image 2" link Images/tikus_usb_02big.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/tikus_usb_02sm.iff"}

@{b}Impressions and Use@{ub}

The Tikus is tiny!  It comes in a nice 3D printed case and measures 
about 3.6 CM (L) x 2.2 CM (W) x 1.5 CM (H) including the connectors.  It 
felt a little loose and rattled slightly but it's nothing to worry 
about, it comes in white although the version bundled with the Tank 
Mouse can come in black if you order a black mouse.  The USB port and 
DB9 connector are both a snug fit and I had no clearance issues plugging 
it into an A600's mouse port.

When you first power on a green LED on the Tikus will blink rapidly for 
a moment.  During this time you can configure the Tikus for your 
particular computer:
- Green LED blinking, USB device detected, ready for configuration.
- Red LED blinking, USB device not detected.
- Press right mouse button while green LED blinking to enter configuration.
- Press left mouse button to cycle through 1) Amiga, 2) Atari, 3) 
  Commodore GEOS.
- Red LED will blink 1, 2 or 3 times to indicate option selected.
- Press right mouse button to save and exit.
- Green LED steady, ready for use.
There's a configuration video here: @{"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i_8K6Cj5mM" system "openurl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i_8K6Cj5mM"}


USB joypads do not require any configuration options to be set and will 
work as-is - if they are supported by the Tikus.

Configuring for my mice took a couple of tries which was more to do with 
timing than difficulty.  Once saved the mice worked right away and I 
could swap them out as needed.  I enabled the mouse scroll wheel in 
Workbench (Prefs/IPrefs) and installed the Tank Mouse driver.  Add the 
tankmouse.driver file to C and call it from your S:User-Startup or use 
the provided installer which will do the same thing.  You can get the 
driver here: @{"https://aminet.net/package/driver/input/TankMouse" system "openurl https://aminet.net/package/driver/input/TankMouse"}

Note:  Many sites still suggest using the Cocolino driver from Elbox 
with the Tikus, this does work but a bug was found when using MUI. I 
experienced this when using MagicMenuPrefs on its own screen, it would 
switch back to the Workbench screen with any use of the scroll wheel.  I 
replaced the Cocolino driver with the Tank Mouse driver and had no more 
problems.

I didn't have as much success with joypads.  First of all I tried my 
Competition Pro USB joystick which didn't work at all, I knew it was a 
long shot but worth a try as that would have been brilliant!  Then I 
tried one of the cheap SNES style USB joypads you can find on Amazon and 
eBay.  That showed some promise, however while I could use the D pad, 
the fire buttons didn't work.  Lastly I tried my TheA500 Mini gamepad 
and that also gave me direction control but no fire.  In fairness the 
project page recommends Buffalo branded SNES style USB joypads and does 
indicate that joypad support is not universal, my joypads almost 
worked.  The mouse support is great and the main reason I needed an 
adapter but I was a little disappointed I couldn't get a joypad to 
work.  Perhaps a future firmware update will improve joypad support but 
it's probably difficult to support everything.

@{b}Summary@{ub}

There are lots of options for using a USB mouse with an Amiga and for 
that purpose it worked flawlessly for me.  My Logitech wireless mice 
were supported as were a random selection of wired USB mice including an 
old Macally one I bought for my G3 iBook.  Scroll wheel support is very 
useful and welcome - it's normal to want to scroll with the wheel and 
it's great to have that functionality in Workbench.  The Tikus didn't 
work with my USB joypads so be aware of that and buy it for the good 
mouse and scroll wheel support -and- maybe your joypads will work too!

@{b}Pros and Cons@{ub}

+ Excellent USB mouse adapter, wireless mice work.
+ Compact, fits the A600.
+ Configuration is fairly straight forward.
+ Scroll wheel support.
+ Price competitive with other adapters.
- Advertised as a Mouse/Joypad adapter which is true but joypad support 
  can be hit or miss.

Other Key Points:
* The version of the Tikus included with the Tank Mouse does not support 
  joypads.

                @{IMG "Images/TechnoSound01_small.iff"}
As Amiga hardware ages and becomes less available existing hardware
prices skyrocket. Audio samplers in particular have been susceptible 
as well. Looking at the eye watering prices of the DSS8 can make you give
up on ever owning a decent Amiga audio sampler.

With this in mind, I was curious when I came across the Techno
SoundTurbo cart being sold on eBay. A quick read of the description
confirmed this as being a new or re-release of the original card by the 
same developer Jon Wheatman. I had the original TechnoSound Turbo cart back
in the day and DSS8, in the last few years Ihave been on the search for
a new cart and dipped my feet into the AOS Amiga Open Sampler, with
disappointing results, as can be read in my reviews in previous issues.

Having used the TechnoSound Turbo in the past and been impressed with
its sampling ability I quickly used the BuyItNow button and waited for
it to arrive.

When you receive the item it is in a simple card board box, if you paid
extra you will get a printed manual, there is no official box so the rest
of the items (sampler, audio cable and disks) are just wrapped in bubble
wrap. The first thing that you will notice, if you had the orginal 
TechnoSound is the reduction in size. I would say it is over half the height
and a little shorter which is a welcome update. 
                @{"TechnoSound Image 2" link Images/TechnoSound02_large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/TechnoSound02_small.iff"}
I wanted to see if the innards had changed and proceeded to open it up.
Printed on the circuit board is TechnoSound ISS 3B, 1990-2023. There are the 
same amount of components (13), however two of the resisters are conntected 
together on one connection, which I did not see on my orginal circuit board.
Two other components are missing, diods labeled S1J224K, they seem to be 
connected to the phono sockets.  As far as my limited understanding of
eletronics goes, diod is to limit the flow of a current in one direction.

Perhaps this is to help with reducing sound feedback? They connect to the 
audio in P2 and P1. The heart of the sampler the A-D Convertor chip has a 
different number and brand name but looking them up on the internet shows 
it to be the same chip as the original board.
                @{"TechnoSound Image3" link Images/TechnoSound03_large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/TechnoSound03_small.iff"}
So, now we have checked the innards of the board time to give the sampler a
go and see how well it performs.

It comes with a new version of the TechnoSound Turbo software, (I think!) at
the bottom it says USA Version. Prior versions of the software would crash
on my system which is an A1200 with a TF1260. The version supplied with 
new sampler runs okay. But there are stability issues. The interface is the 
same as before, this is a good thing if you liked the it or bad if you did
not. I fall into the latter group, it is not very intuitive and I find
SteroMaster IV a much better experience. Though I seem to get better samples
with the TechnoSound software so I have to grind my teeth and bear with the
interface.

My main gripe is the difficulty in trimming a sample, in AudioMaster IV and
other sampler software this was a simple case of selecting the area I want
and cutting it out. TechnoSound does not give you any visual cues as to
where you are selecting in the sound wave. So, when I save my sample, what
should be a 45Kb sample ends up being 4MB since I was unable to trim it down
to a more reasonable size. I can edit the sample in AudioMaster but it would
have been nice to have modern implementation of the TechnoSound software.

Like all Amiga samplers, when you sample the screen will go blank, you can
monitor what you are sampling before clicking on record. I have included
some samples that I took with the TechnoSound and you can hear how they 
sound. And this is where the TechnoSound really shines, as it should! I use
the technique that was suggested by Tony Horgan of sampling in from my 
MacBook in Renoise, I use the built in compressor to boost the sample and 
this allows for a loud, crisp and relatively noise free sample. Much better
than the OAS that I used the past. It is not quite at the level of the DSS8
sampler but it gets quite close.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

If you are after a quality Amiga sampler and the TechnoSound Turbo is still
being sold, then I highly recommend purchasing one. It has the benefit of
a smaller footprint, but retains the high quality sampling ability. While it
would have been welcome to have an updated version of the software there are
other options out there so it is not such an issue.

Be it tracking, game development or just simply having fun, the new 
TechnoSound Turbo is a great purchase. I suggest skipping the AOS samplers
that are available and buy this great cart instead.

@{b}Pros and Cons@{ub}

+ A quality product that is better than the first edition.
+ Half the size of the original.
+ Better sampling quality than the AOS.
+ Reasonable price.
+ Software update is a compatible with upgraded Amigas.
- TechnoSound software is still difficult to use.
- Still has unstable.

Other Key Points:
* Included audio cable is not the best quality and it is recommended to use
a shielded cable to for better results.

@{b}Introduction@{ub}

When I think back to heady days of the 80s and 90s, I remember my bookshelf
heaving under the weight of so many manuals. While I still treasured those 
manuals they were also taking up a lot of room. Little did I know that 
thirty years later I would be looking back on those memories with fondness
and envy. Here we are in 2025 and the physical manual is dead. It is not
suprising when you read about the reports of literacy declining around the
world and over half of adults not even reading one book a year. I have been
buying up old boxed Amiga software just so I can get my manuals back as they
are an essential source of information. As such it was a nice surprise when
I saw the advertisement for AmigaOS 3.2 Reference Manual in an issue of 
Amiga Future. At the time though the manual was only available in German but
LookBehindYou, the publisher had mentioned an English version was coming. In
September of 2024 the English version went live on their website and I 
bought it right there and then.
		@{"AmigaOS 3.2 Book Image 2" link Images/Os32book02_large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/Os32book02_small.iff"}
Shipping was unusually fast from Germany to Japan and came well packed in a
hard cardboard shell and wrapped in plastic. First impressions of the book
are it is a heavy hardback brimming full of Amiga information. Proudly 
printed on the front is the text, AMIGAOS 3.2 Reference Manual with the 
obligatory boing ball and Amiga A letter set against a strong red 
background. Included is a very useful reading tassle to keep your spot, a
very thoughtful feature for such a large book. It comes in at 480 pages and
is in gorgeous full colour.

The book is split into 8 sections:

	Chapter 1: Installation
	Chapter 2: Basics
	Chapter 3: Preferences (Prefs)
	Chapter 4: Programs
	Chapter 5: The Shell
	Chapter 6: Power User
	Chapter 7: Next Steps
	Chapter 8: Quick Reference

Chapters 1-4 are marked in orange to indicate basic knowledge, chapters 5 
and 6 are in red and are aimed at experienced users. The final two chapters
7 to 8 are general knowledge i.e. frequently asked questions such as how to 
transfer data, setting up internet, recommended software and Amiga DOS error
codes.

All the content is laid out in an easy to read format with full colour 
photos spread throughout. It can be read by a complete new user or if you 
are a more experienced user the later chapers will be of use. There is an
incredible amount of information from a listing of the Shell commands, to
the most useful commands for creating AmigaGuide documents. Since buying the
book I delved into it several times when editing an issue to confirm a 
formatting command that is only available with OS3.2.

@{b}Beyond 3.2@{ub}

What I particularly enjoy is how the authors have not restrained themselves
to only Workbench 3.2. They also cover alternative file systems, hardware
expansions, diffent software options for getting the Amiga online. There are
sections that cover how to add a scandoubler, memory or accelerator and they
cover all the Amiga models.
		@{"AmigaOS 3.2 Book Image 3" link Images/Os32book03_large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/Os32book03_small.iff"}
Finally there is a section named @{b}Software must-haves@{ub}, and this is a great
source of information especially for people new to the Amiga or even those 
coming back to the Amiga. If you are an experienced user there might be some
information new to you.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

With printed manuals few and far between nowadays, the release of the 
AmigaOS 3.2 Reference manual makes it special event. If you have even a
little interest in the Amiga and want to get more out of it then this is a
book you need. It takes many cues from the original Amiga manauls and 
updates them with modern users in mind. The fact that it caters to new and
old users does not dimish its value in anyway. While the first half of book 
was not relevant to my Amiga knowledge I am glad that it is there, just in 
case I forget something.

Finally, it is a gorgeous looking book and stands out with pride on my 
bookshelf shouting, Amiga! When we have guests over they often ask about the
big red book on our bookshelf. Which is a great kick off point to talk about
the Amiga, where by I say, "So, have you heard of the Amiga?". 

Snap up this book while it is still available and display it with pride and 
hopefully you will also find some real use out of it. 

@{b}Pros and Cons@{ub}

+ Suitable for beginners and pro-users.
+ Full colour images.
+ Hardback cover.
- Could have a bit more information regarding the Shell and AmigaGuide.

@{b}Review@{ub}

Final Fight and Hangman, three words that I never thought I would see in
the same sentence, but in December 2024 the Amiga world was introduced to
this little gem of a game. Created in AMOS by the developer Fourseasons
the game is available from their itch.io page and is listed at a name your
own price.

The game takes influence from the Final Fight "continue" screen and blends
that with the classic Hangman game. It comes on an ADF, you need to make
sure you can write to the disk though as it saves scores. I was able to
copy it to my hard disk but it did not run and was only able to do it from
the ADF, however that in turn did not allow me to save the scores. For the
moment you will need to write the ADF to a physical disk and use it that 
way to save scores. Hopefully a way will be figured out for it to be run 
from the hard disk.

The first screen you see when loading the game is a classic Capcom style 
disclaimer screen, very nice! Pressing any key will take you the title
screen with a very well done screen with a great take on the Final Fight
title screen. Pressing the SPACE bar will get the game going.

From here on you have a Santa Clause crossed Mike Haggar character tied up
with some dynamite burning down. There is a little animation with the 
character blowing on the spark. Underneath you have letter spaces, just
like hang man, you need to press a letter on the keyboard to guess the
words. You have several chances before poor Santa Haggar is blown up.

The phrases are usually Amiga related so this game is really aimed at
Amiga users. When I tried it with my students they enjoyed the game but
were confused on some of the Amiga references, some more education is due
I believe!

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

Final bHangman is an enjoyable little game that can be a nice way to pass
the time or use even in classes. It would have been nice to have words that
were not only Amiga related, perhaps in a future update? That aside the
game is easy to pick up and is fun for a little while. Played alone or with
another this is another nice game that us Amiga users should treat 
themselves to.

@{b}Pros and Cons:@{ub}
+ A nice twist on the hang man idea
+ Graphics are few but do a nice job
- Only aimed at people knowledgeable about the Amiga

@{b}Review@{ub}

In issue 2.11 (September 2023) I reviewed the game CyberPunks 2, and found
it to be a very enjoyable experience. December 2024 we were treated to 
another game by Adrian, just in time for Xmas, Dungeonette. The game had 
come out originally for the AppleWatch in 2015 and the ZX Spectrum Next in
2018. Adrian then rewrote the game for stock AGA Amigas, taking around
18 months to develop and was written completely in 68x0 assembly language.

At its core, Dungeonette is a dungeon crawler but you are not restricted to
dungeons and will also be able to explore forests and mountains. There are
16 stages in total with a boss at the end of each fourth stage. Gameplay is 
simple with the use of only one button to swipe your sword with, for 
switches you simpley walk into them to activate. At the end of each level 
you have the option to buy upgrades for armour, weapons, and spells.

I found it a little difficult to get the handle of the gameplay mechanics
as the your starter sword has a very short reach, so enemies have to come
very close for you to be able to kill them. However, after a few aborted
attempts I began get the handle of and was able to progress several stages.

The game is a mix of hack and slash, exploration and figuring out simple
puzzles. It makes for a very enjoyable game experience, I can feel 
influences from CyberPunks 2 with the coins, even the coin sound effect
seems the same.

Graphics wise they are very nicely done, while again like with CyberPunks 2
I would not be able to say right away this is an AGA game. They work very
well and the limited view when in the dungeons makes for a nice effect and
adds to the gameplay. Outside you have brighter and bolder colours all drawn
skillfully. The animation is smooth and your character looks quite cute as 
he bobs along when in movement.

Regarding audio, there is some catchy organ music for the title screen but
during gameplay there is no BGM. But, we have something better, very 
effective sound effects, on the first stage you hear birds chirping in the
background bringing the environment alive. In the dungeons there are creepy
sounds that help increase the feeling of dread and isolation.

Gameplay once you get the hang of the fighting system is done very nicely,
it becomes second nature and you are able to get into the game experience
without having to worry about what to do. If you die in the game you can go
back to where you were before but start at the beginning of the stage.

However, if you quit your game, all progress is gone, which is unfortunate
as you will need to finish the game in one go or like we used to do back in
the day, turn off your monitor and leave on the Amiga until you can return
back to it. Saying all that though, the game is relatively easy and I am 
sure with some determination most people can finish the game, this does not
diminish the game in anyway though as it is wholely entertaining experience.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

Dungeonette is a fun game that should not be viewed as an RPG, but as pint
sized RPG'ish game. It has all the right elements for an entertaining game
has wonderful visuals and spot on audio. If can find the boxed version still
buy it right away, if not then buy the download version and make sure you
have a few hours free time prepared.

@{b}Pros and Cons:@{ub}
+ Graphics and audio are very well balanced and work well
+ Gameplay easy to pick up after initial learning curve
+ Not too hard
- No saving progress

@{b}Upgrade a PiStorm32 with Raspberry Pi3A+ to Pi-CM4 module@{ub} by: @{"John Scolieri" link johnscolieri}
=============================================================================

If you haven't already guessed from my previous articles on the PiStorm32 
accelerator board for the Amiga 1200 I'm a huge fan, so when a good friend 
of mine asked if I had any use for a Raspberry Pi CM4 module, which he had 
lying around in his shop that wasn't being used, I enthusiastically yelled 
YES!

To be clear I've been loving my PiStrom32 with a Raspberry Pi 3A+ running 
OS3.2.2  installed but when this free CM4 module fell in my lap and me being 
a hardware tinkerer since the 80's I decided to upgrade my 3A+ to CM4 in my 
Pistorm32. Initially I was going to remove the 3A+ and install the CM4 along
with expansion adapter board that cleans up the messy cables from the 3A+ to 
a clean back plate at the rear case of the Amiga 1200; however, I realized 
I wanted to keep my PiStorm32 with 3A+ as a backup just in case anything 
goes wrong with the CM4 install or to instantly plug into my 1200 Tower one 
day.

Here's what you need to get started:
- Pistorm32
- microSD card (that you were using with your 3A+ installed)
- Raspberry Pi CM4 module (get module with wifi if you want to get online)
- CM4 adaptor board
- Breakout expansion board (accessories incl.)
- heatsink for CM4
- CPU fan (optional if you're not overclocking the CM4)

Now that we have all the parts we need follow the steps below:

Step 1:

First step is to boot up your PiStorm32-3A+ before removing it from your 
1200. Go to HDToolBox and edit the SCSI_DEVICE_NAME after the = sign to read 
"brcm-sdhc.device"-don't enter quotes (See Pic 1). IMP: Don't forget to
click Save and shut down your 1200.
                @{"PIC 1" link Images/Pic-1large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/Pic-1sm.iff"}
Step Two:

Remove your PiStorm32 from your 1200. Take your SD card out of your 3A+ 
and make a copy of your SD card on your computer as a backup as you really 
don't want to start the full setup again from scratch and it's always good 
to have a backup (I used Win32DiskImage on my PC which makes an exact clone 
of the SD card).

Step Three:

Put your SD card into your PC and add the following line into the 
cmdline.txt file:

"sd.unit0=rw emmc.unit0=rw" (don't enter quotes)

Step Four:

Install the 3 plastic spacers to the CM4 adapter board and line up 3 
screws through the spacers (See Pic 2).

                @{IMG "Images/Pic-2sm.iff"}
                @{"PIC 2-1" link Images/Pic-2-1large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/Pic-2-1sm.iff"}
Step Five:

Line up and press down to install the PiStorm with the CM4 adapter board 
connector and plastic spacers ensuring screw heads are fully through the 
PiStorm32 board (See Pics 3&4).
                @{"PIC 3" link Images/Pic-3large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/Pic-3sm.iff"}
                @{"PIC 4" link Images/Pic-4large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/Pic-4sm.iff"}
Step Six:

Insert 4 screws and washers to connect the CM4 module to the expansion 
board (See Pic 5).
                @{"PIC 5" link Images/Pic-5large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/Pic-5sm.iff"}
Step Seven:

Install the CM4 module to the expansion board connector ensuring the 
screws are fully through the CM4 board & apply a thin coat of thermal paste 
to the top of the CM4 CPU (see Pic 6)
                @{"PIC 6" link Images/Pic-6large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/Pic-6sm.iff"}
Step Nine:

Install heatsink atop the CM4 with supplied nuts and add optional fan 
atop the heatsink ( I purchased a slighlty thicker fan so had to offset it 
a bit towards the back of the case to make sure it cleared the keyboard in 
my 1200 hence why I needed to use some hot glue to mount it on the heatsink. 
Make sure you connect the CPU fan to the pin header on the CM4 adapter 
board (See Pic 7)
                @{"PIC 7" link Images/Pic-7large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/Pic-7sm.iff"}
Step Ten:

Install screw at base of case and install backplate (make sure it clicks 
in on both sides of the case) and Breakout expansion board, install screw 
and connect ribbon cable to both CM4 expansion board and Breakout board 
(See Pics 8 & 9). Lastly don't forget to connect your HD light wire to pin 
PP13 on your CM4 adaptor board (See Pic 10)
                @{"PIC 8" link Images/Pic-8large.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/Pic-8sm.iff"}

                @{IMG "Images/Pic-10sm.iff"}
And you're done! Congratulations you now have the fastest PiStorm32 setup 
(well at least for now anyhow :-).

Here's a clean view of the backside of my 1200 (See Pic 11)

@{b}Using OpenURL: WhatIFF?@{ub} by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

In the last few issues of WhatIFF? we have started to include buttons with
url links, these are using the OpenURL programme. For those of you have not
installed it or are having some troubles getting the links to work from 
within the magazine, here is a short guide on setting it up.

@{b}Step One@{ub}

First you want to download the OpenURL software, this can be found from 
Aminet at: @{"www.aminet.net/package/comm/www/OpenURL-7.18" system "openurl http://www.aminet.net/package/comm/www/OpenURL-7.18"} once you have it 
downloaded to your Amiga, extract it and run the installer.

Make sure you choose the correct version according to your Amiga setup/OS
version.

@{b}Step Two@{ub}

Once it is installed, double check your Prefs directory to see if it has 
copied over the OpenURL prefs file. If not then copy it by hand to the
Prefs directory. For some reason my installer did not copy over the icon as
such the icons was not visible until using Show All. I ended up copying the 
the pref file by hand.

		@{"OpenURL Image 1" link Images/OpenURL1.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/OpenURL1.iff"}
@{b}Step Three@{ub}

I will presume that you already have a brower installed by now, start the 
OpenURL Prefs file and you will be presented with a list of browers, and
several tabs for Email and FTP programs. By default the browsers will not be
activated, as indicated by red square. Double click on the square to 
activate your installed or prefered browser. As I just own IBrowse, I 
deleted the other browsers.

     		      @{"OpenURL Image 2" link Images/OpenURL2.iff/MAIN}
                      @{IMG "Images/OpenURL2.iff"}
@{b}Step Four@{ub}

Next click on Edit on the right panel, locate Path and click on the button,
from here you will need to tell the programme where your browser is located.
For example, my IBrowse is located at: Workbench:Programs/Internet/IBrowse

If I did not change the default setting of OpenURL it will not be able to 
locate my IBrowse and start it.

That's it, now you will be able to open the links in the WhatIFF? articles
and download the software/games straight to your Amiga.

@{b}How To Implement OpenURL in AmigaGuide@{ub}

If you want to add the ability to open links in your own AmigaGuide 
documents, then all you need to do it use the below commands:

 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 | @ {"www.whatiff.info" system "openurl https://www.whatiff.info"} |
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note, you need to remove the space after the @ sign to get OpenURL
to work. A space has been added to stop the code becoming a button and
show how it is created.

@{b}DigiPaint: Basics - Part 1@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

@{b}Introduction@{ub}

The first program I used on the Amiga, or that I can at least remember
was DigiPaint. Using an Amiga was a magical experience in the 80s, I think
you had to be there at the time to realise how advanced the Amiga was for
the time. Using DigiPaint for the first time was like encountering something
from the future. But with all the power came complexity, while DigiPaint is
not an overly complex program to use it can be a bit confusing for those
whom have never used it or are returning to it after being away for a while.

In this new tutorial series we will explore how to use DigiPaint and what is
possible with it.

@{b}DigiPaint History@{ub}

To begin with let's delve into the history of DigiPaint, the first release
was in 1986 and was released at the same time as DigiView. You might have
seen DigiView as device that connects to a camera and allows you to digitise
images in colour using a red/green/blue colour wheel. Since there was no
software to edit photos on the Amiga, NewTek also released DigiPaint shortly
after. The final release was version 3 in 1989 for 50.00 USD. It was the 
first paint package to take advantage of the HAM mode, prior to DigiPaint 
you could only use a maximum of 32 colours, there were no versions released 
for the AGA machines. However it does run on AGA Amigas and takes advantage 
of a faster CPU making for a smoother user experience.

We will concentrate on the last release of DigiPaint, version 3 as it has 
several useful features such as:

 - Texture mapping with anti-aliasing
 - Controllable transparency
 - Rainbow and anti-aliased fonts
 - Brush rotation and resizing with anti-aliasing
 - Interface designed by Jim Sachs

@{b}Getting Started@{ub}

If possible try to purchase the boxed version of DigiPaint 3 as the boxart 
is gorgeous and manual will prove invaluable. However, it is not necessary
for this tutorial series and you will do fine with downloading the ADFs
from the Internet. Installation is simple, just drag the disk to your 
desired location and launch the application from there.

A quick note here, if you are running Amiga OS3.1+ you might encounter
some problems when quiting from the program. Quiting is done from the
menu bar but the requestor is cut off on newer Workbenches, you can get
aroud this by using @{b}(Left Amiga + V)@{ub}. Using this combination only works
when you use Quit from the menu bar.

Starting DigiPaint3 will bring up a black screen with a panel with buttons
if you use Brilliance it will seem familiar. Pressing the right mouse button
will bring up the menu bar, it will not appear from the top of the screen
but from the top of the tool bar. To begin with bring up the drop down menu
and go to Prefs -> Open Workbench. By default Workbench is closed but since
we will be working with the article in MultiView being able to switch 
between screens will make things easier.

In this tutorial we will concentrate on drawing shapes as DigiPaint works a 
bit differently from other art packages. Looking at the left side of the
toolbar you will see the drawing tools. From the left the buttons are as
following:

  * Freehand (Keyboard shortcut: s)
  * Freehand Continuous (Keyboard shortcut: d - unfilled, D - filled)
  * Polygon/Straight Line (Keyboard shortcut: v - unfilled, V - filled)
  * Rectangle (Keyboard shortcut: r - unfilled, R - filled)
  * Circle (Keyboard shortcut: c - unfilled, C - filled)
  * Ellipse (Keyboard shortcut: e - unfilled, E - filled)
  * Fill (Keyboard shortcut: f - off, F - on)

Next to the drawing/painting buttons you have 'Brush Size', 'Brush Shape'.

Let's try to re-create an element from the images on the back of the box,
it has the wood floor, with a floating globe and cube. To begin with we
will make the 3D cube effect which is surprisingly easy with DigiPaint.

Select the 'Polygon/Straight Line' tool and use it in 'Fill' mode, you can
do this by clicking on 'Fill' first or pressing 'V'. DigiPaint polygon mode
works differently to other programs in that once you have two lines they 
will be connected, creating a shape. By moving the mouse and clicking with 
the left mouse button you can add more lines to create a shape. When you 
you are satisfied click on the right mouse button. For this tutorial we will 
use the default colours, select the lighter green colour and draw a square 
with the top and bottom at 45 degree angles, the left and right should be 
straight.

When selecting your colour remember to click on the colour on the left of
the gradient, by default it will be yellow. A white box will surround the
colour and then you can choose the lighter green.

Once you have one side of your box you usually would be able to copy and
paste it down and then fill it with another colour but since DigiPaint
does not have a fill tool. However, there is another way you can do this,
and that is by cutting/copy your image, flipping it around and stamping it
down in another colour. 

To cut an image and not include the black background you need to go to the 
menu bar first and find, Brush -> No Background. If you do not do this first 
when you pick up a part of the image it will grab the black background as 
well. Setting 'No Background' will fix this problem.

Next use the 'Scissors' tool and create an outline around your one side 
cube. When it has been picked up we then need to flip the brush, this is 
done from the menu again: Effect -> Flip Horizontal

After selecting this your brush will be flipped and we can stamp it down
on the other side to create a 3D cube effect, but before doing that we need
to change the colour. This is done by clicking on the left colour of the 
gradient, you might need to click on it more than once, then click on the
lighter/darker green colour swatch. You will be able to tell it has been 
selected by the left colour box changing to the selected colour. A white
outline will appear on the colour selector indicating it is active.

The neat part about this is if you are using the gradient tool, you can
stamp down a gradient of the brush, and changing the gradient by choosing
different colours on the left and right of the gradient selector. However
we will stop their for the moment and go into detail on using the gradient 
and texture tool in part 2. 

Good luck with your experimentation with DigiPaint and see you in
the next issue!

@{b}Accessing BBSs Without A Modem@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

@{b}Getting Online with BBSs Without a Modem@{ub}

If you were computing in the 80s and 90s, the screech of the modem down the  
telephone line will bring back (hopefully!) fond memories. With the advent  
of ADSL and now fibre Internet access, connecting to a BBS via a modem has  
become a rare, if not impossible, task. However, as with all things retro  
computing, enthusiasts have kept the BBS flame alive and developed modern  
ways to connect.

One of these modern methods is @{b}Telnet@{ub}, a client/server protocol that  
provides access to virtual terminals on remote systems over a local network  
or the Internet. Created in the 1960s, Telnet stands for Teletype Network  
and was initially used as a tool for network administration. By the mid-90s,  
as the Internet grew in popularity, many BBS operators added Telnet support,  
allowing users to connect over the Internet rather than via a telephone  
modem.

Since Telnet does not offer built-in encryption, it has fallen out of  
widespread use due to security concerns. However, some modern @{b}Telnet-based  
BBSs@{ub} enhance security by using SSH tunnelling or similar techniques to  
encrypt the connection. Despite Telnet's text-based roots, many BBSs still  
feature ANSI art, graphics, and menu-driven interfaces that create a 
nostalgic user experience.

@{b}Telnet vs. Dial-Up Modem Connections@{ub}

If you think about dialling into a BBS back in the day, the process is  
fundamentally the same: you control the remote computer by sending commands.  
However, instead of transmitting data over a phone line, Telnet uses the  
TCP/IP protocol for communication. This means you can connect to a BBS using  
modern Internet connections, even on (ahem!) vintage systems like the Amiga,  
provided they have a compatible TCP/IP stack.

Popular TCP/IP stacks for Amiga computers include Roadshow, which is still  
being developed and supported, and AmiTCP, an older but functional option.  
Once your Amiga is connected to the Internet, all you need is a Telnet  
client, and you're ready to relive the golden age of BBSs. A great choice  
for the Amiga is DCTelnet, a Telnet client that works very well.

@{b}How to Get Started@{ub}

1. **Set Up Internet Access**  
   First, you'll need to connect your Amiga to the Internet via a TCP/IP  
   stack. I recommend Roadshow, as it is actively developed and supports  
   modern Internet protocols. By purchasing Roadshow, you also support the  
   ongoing efforts of Amiga developers. Alternatively, older programs like  
   AmiTCP can also work and are free.

2. **Install a Telnet Client**  
   Once your Internet connection is up and running, the next step is  
   installing a Telnet client. For the Amiga, DCTelnet is the ideal choice.  
   Be sure to install it using the included installer; simply copying the  
   program drawer can lead to issues with missing files or improper  
   configuration.

3. **Find a BBS**  
   Many classic BBSs are no longer active, but a new generation of Telnet-  
   accessible BBSs has emerged. These modern BBSs often retain the nostalgic  
   feel of the originals while offering updated content and features. To  
   find active BBSs, check out resources like Telnet BBS Guide  
   (www.telnetbbsguide.com) or ask on the major Amiga forums.

4. **Connect to a BBS**  
   Once you have found a BBS, such as one from the Telnet BBS Guide, you can  
   connect to it. In the past, you would have dialled a telephone number,  
   but now, it's a URL, usually in this format:  
   
   `strangeplanet.org:6800`.

   Using DCTelnet makes connecting very simple. Click on "Connect", and type  
   in `strangeplanet.org,6800`. Note that the ":" is replaced with a ",". If  
   you forget to use the "," DCTelnet will not be able to connect to the BBS.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

Connecting to a BBS via Telnet is a fantastic way to relive the golden age  
of computing while exploring the vibrant Amiga BBS community. Or if you wish
to visit other platform specific BBSs there is a whole new world of ANSI art 
and text-based gaming waiting to be explored.  

While Gemini can be seen as a modern equivalent of the "look" of BBSs, it  
does not offer the same immediate communication and community experience  
that a BBS does. So, best of luck with your Telnet journeys and see you
out there in the BBS ether!  

A great place to start is ciaamiga.org:6400, an old-school BBS in the best  
way. It's hosted on an Amiga 1200/030 with 32MB of RAM and 8GB of disk  
space!

=============================================================================
@{b}DELL Monitors and 15 kHz - Part 1: Will it work?@{ub} - by: @{"Martyn Bampton" link martynbampton}
=============================================================================

In this two part article I thought it would be useful to share my 
experiences with some Dell monitors and their ability to display native 
Amiga 15 kHz video over VGA.  I should say that this isn't a monitor 
review as such but an informal look at what works (Part 1) and how to 
make it better (Part 2).

You're probably aware that "some" Dell LCD/LED monitors "may" display 15 
kHz signals with several Websites detailing which do and which don't and 
lots of forum posts about it.  Such monitors are fairly inexpensive with 
the cost of delivery being more expensive in some cases.  You also have 
to consider the age of a monitor and any potential useful life it may 
have left as well as possible delivery damage.  Disclaimers such as 
"worked last time I used it", "as-is", "no returns", "sold for parts and 
repair" don't instill confidence in the buyer.  After doing my research 
and thinking about it for while - weighing up the pros and cons versus 
an expensive upscaler for each of my desks - I decided to chance the 
Dell 15 kHz option. The odds seemed good so I ordered a few Dell 
monitors reported to have 15 kHz support on these lists:

* @{"https://goldenchild2.blogspot.com/2023/04/amiga-500-ntsc-vga-15khz-monitor-list.html" system "openurl https://goldenchild2.blogspot.com/2023/04/amiga-500-ntsc-vga-15khz-monitor-list.html"}

* @{"https://www.amiga.net.au/15KHz%20Monitors.html" system "openurl https://www.amiga.net.au/15KHz%20Monitors.html"}

@{b}Monitors Tested (multiples of each)@{ub}

                @{"DELL 2410f 15 kHz VGA Image" link Images/dell2410f15kHzvga_lr.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/dell2410f15kHzvga_sm.iff"}

@{b}U2410f@{ub} - No revision or date marked @{fg highlight}or so I thought, it's on 
a daft pull out tab, thanks for mentioning that Roy!@{fg text}
Rev A02 (September 2010) and Rev A07 (August 2012)
24" display, reported to have the best support and it has a tonne of 
inputs, HDMI, DP, 2 x DVI, VGA, Component and Composite.  It even has 
picture-in-picture!  It's a very heavy monitor though, 6 Kg without the 
stand (which wasn't included)!  Really, my monitor arm struggled with 
it.  I tested two of these monitors, I assume they're of similar age 
from the same batch from the same seller.

                @{"DELL U2212HMc A1200 15 kHz VGA" link Images/dellu2212hmcA120015kHzv_lr.iff/MAIN}

                @{IMG "Images/dellu2212hmcA120031kHzv_sm.iff"}

@{b}U2212HMc@{ub} - Rev A03 (June 2012)
A nice 22" monitor which is a little more modern looking and much, much 
lighter than the U2410f.  It has DP, DVI and VGA inputs.  Two monitors 
tested, both Rev A03 from the same seller.

@{b}P2414Hb@{ub} - Rev A00 (September 2013 and October 20213), Rev A01 (June 2014)
The P2414Hb is another decently designed 24" monitor, sharing the design 
and inputs of the U2212HM.  I also got two stands and they're very nice 
too, if overly... "Dell." 5 Monitors tested in this batch, 4 Rev A00 
and 1 Rev A01 from two different sellers.

Note: Revision versions are something to be aware of.  Sometimes 
different revisions of the same product code may not support 15 kHz 
inputs so be aware of that.  This was my main concern as many multiple 
listings won't guarantee the item (and therefore revision) you'll 
receive.  It seems that Dell uses XXYY in these model numbers where XX 
is the size and YY is the year.

@{b}Testing@{ub}

To test each monitor I used several RGB to VGA adapters - my original 
silver A4000 390682-01 adapter, a buffered adapter from AMIGAStore.eu 
and a very nice AMI-RGB2VGA Ultimate vertical line remover.  This 
adapter has 3 DIP switches allowing you to filter out noise at various 
frequencies (9.5, 18, 36 and 72 MHz).  I used a PAL Amiga 500 and tested 
each monitor in turn with each adapter, first just to the Kickstart 
screen and then loading Workbench 1.3 and a game (Troddlers) from 
floppy.  I was cautiously optimistic leaving room for disappointment but 
I was very happy to find that every monitor I tested displayed 15 kHz!  
There was very little signal noise and the display filled most of the 
screen with little adjustment needed.  I did see vertical lines when 
using the first two adapters so I was interested to see what it would 
look like through the AMI-RGB2VGA Ultimate.  It was much reduced, really 
it made a big difference the lines were still there but much fainter. 
With some display setting tweaking you can reduce it further.  I didn't 
notice any ghosting, blurring or lag in testing or in subsequent use 
across a variety of games.  Of course everyone and every monitor is 
different and your gaming experience may vary.

Since the U2410f has a composite input I tried it with a PAL CD32, again 
it worked without issues, obviously not as clear as VGA but fine for games.

The next thing to try was 31 kHz modes in Workbench (AmigaOS 3.2) on a 
PAL A1200, specifically how each monitor copes with switching to and 
from 15 kHz for games.  Again I had no issues with all the monitors 
displaying everything from the early boot menu, to games, to the higher 
resolution PAL and NTSC Workbench screenmodes.  I should say that 
interlaced modes still flicker, there's no flicker fixing but they are 
displayed correctly.  Of course you'll have to adjust your overscan 
preferences, monitor display settings and use a tool like MonSpecsMUI or 
MonEd (and some tricks) to get the best result.  I'll go over this in 
more detail in Part 2 but the point here is the monitors work 
surprisingly well in my experience.  You can have a rock solid display 
of around 700 by 500 pixels with AGA and an RGB to VGA adapter and 
switch to lower resolution 15 kHz games/apps and back easily which is 
amazing!  Just like a multiscan CRT monitor.

I was hoping the vertical lines in the 31 kHz modes would be reduced by 
the AMI-RGB2VGA Ultimate but the AGA chipset runs at a higher frequency 
producing higher frequency components.  However, when launching a game 
you get the same 15 kHz benefits with reduced lines, Wing Commander 
looked brilliant with the AMI-RGB2VGA Ultimate!  I'll cover this more in 
my AMI-RGB2VGA Ultimate review.

@{b}Conclusion@{ub}

After a lot of testing I can say that the U2410f, U2212HMc and P2414Hb 
monitors I received all worked with 15 kHz native Amiga RGB video via 
simple 23 pin RGB to VGA adapters. In addition the U2410f worked with a 
CD32 (and a BBC Master 128) over composite.  PAL and NTSC were both 
displayed and the picture quality is generally good with the some 
vertical lines present.  A vertical line remover like the AMI-RGB2VGA 
Ultimate can improve things noticeably.  While these monitors are used, 
may be dimmer, have blemishes or even fail, they are a solid option if 
you can find them at a good price.  All of the monitors tested are over 
a decade old and past their prime. Brightness and general condition 
looks somewhat degraded and in most cases I didn't even get a stand.  
However they will work fine for my purposes and for those set ups 
without RGB2HDMI or an Indivision Flickerfixer.  They're a cheaper 
option than many upscalers and much better than those cheap SCART to 
HDMI adapters.  I'm glad I gave them a chance.

@{b}The Amiga, you, us, the community@{ub}

In any hobby there is always conflict. Sometimes it is between different 
interpretations of what the hobby is always about. Maybe it is between 
different ages of users or between different sub-categories. Often it is 
about commercial interests versus hobbyists and sometimes it is simply 
because people like to argue. 

The Amiga is no different and I think all of you reading this has seen 
your share of debates, arguments and long standing feuds between 
individuals, groups and companies.

One of the joys of a hobby like retro computing is that it is both a 
very communal hobby and a very solitary one. The communal aspect is both 
practical: If you want new software someone has to code it, if you want 
new hardware someone has to build it. It is also human: We like to talk 
about our shared interests, show off neat things we have and indulge in a 
bit of past history and nostalgia.

If you are trying to make something work, it's helpful to have someone to 
ask. If you just beat Breathless, it's nice to have someone else tell you 
"good job". 

On the other hand, retro computing is also often a solitary experience: 
Whether you are a builder, a tinkerer, a musician or a gamer, odds are you 
do much of it alone. There is a zen to sitting and working with something 
that you not only do on your own, but the activity is not a common or shared 
one. You can disappear into your thoughts for a little and ignore the world. 

With the transition of this publication to a new editor, I thought it was a 
good time to perhaps give an encouragement to Amiga users and that is to be 
a user of the Amiga.
 
Perhaps that sounds self evident but let me explain. The biggest danger of 
the Amiga scene is not the infighting or the companies or the tribes. It is 
apathy. It is games being developed without being played, hardware being 
tested for 2 minutes and then put away, systems that get booted once in a 
while to play a demo and then sit for months.

For the Amiga scene to continue flourishing, it needs action. It needs 
people doing things. It needs to be a computer. Use your Amiga. Find 
something you have never done before. Transfer an activity to the Amiga. 
Complete a game series you always wanted to. If you buy a new piece of 
hardware, let people know how it worked not just for a benchmark but in 
consistent usage. If a game is released, give feedback to the creator and 
help track down bugs. 

All things eventually pass. The Amiga will too. But if I don't it is today.

@{b}ChatGPT and Amiga: How Wrong Can It Get It?@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

When I had an idea for a new article I thought it could prove to be 
interesting to ask ChatGPT for help, to see in a way how much of the heavy 
lifting it could or not do. The main idea of the article was to investigate 
some of options for patching a Kickstart ROM, aside from what some people 
might think of this as being unnecessary, this came about from my last 
article about patching a Kickstart ROM to make an NTSC Amiga boot into PAL 
by default, Excursions Into NTSC.

Prior to this article I had not paid too much attention to what can be done 
to Kickstart, but my article kickstarted (sorry!), my interest into what is
possible. From my limited knowledge, I knew about the PAL patch and the
EIDE.device that can be added to allow users to boot from the onboard IDE
on the TF1260, but what else is there? So, I went off to ChatGPT and typed
"What ROM mods can be applied to Amiga Kickstart ROMS?" and it came up with
theses answers. Apologies for the length of this, but since we are an Amiga-
Guide magazine we can get away with this type article. So, without further
ado let's get into it ...

@{b}Question:@{ub} 
What ROM mods can be applied to Amiga Kickstart ROMS?

@{b}ChatGPT Answers:@{ub}

Amiga Kickstart ROMs can be modified or patched in various ways to 
enhance functionality, compatibility, or add features. Here are some common 
modifications (ROM mods) that can be applied to Amiga Kickstart ROMs:

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}1. Custom Boot Logos or Themes@{fg text}@{bg background}
Modify the startup screen to include custom logos, colors, or text.
Tools like LogoHack allow editing of the startup message or graphical 
elements.

#Point 1:

The first point that it mentions is a real patch or hack that can be done
but the software LogpoHack does not exist, the real software is called at
AmigaBootLogo

=> https://github.com/JensRestmeister/AmigaBootLogo

We can discuss if this a usetool tool or not since many people use a hard
disk nowadays but this is not in the scope of the article.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}2. FastROM/FastKick Patches@{fg text}@{bg background}
Enhance system performance by optimizing routines in the Kickstart ROM, 
reducing boot times, or improving memory access.

#Point 2:
Originally I thought ChatGPT was referring to adding EIDE.device for faster
hard disk access. But as was pointed out on EAB it is referring to the 
moving of the ROM into Fast Memory via FastROM which does speed up Workbench
actions.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}3. WHDLoad Compatibility@{fg text}@{bg background}
Patch Kickstart ROMs to improve compatibility with WHDLoad, which allows 
you to run old games and demos from hard drives. This may involve adding 
missing libraries or modifying existing components.

#Point 3:
Hmm, this definetly put up a red flag for me, the entire reason for WHDLoad 
is that it allows games to be booted up on all systems from the hard disk, 
it does not make sense to "improve" WHDLoad compatability from the 
Kickstart.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}4. Workbench Enhancements@{fg text}@{bg background}
Integrate more recent or custom versions of Workbench libraries and 
utilities, such as:

SetPatch (for additional updates).
Updated versions of exec.library, intuition.library, or other key system 
components.

#Point 4:
This time ChatGPT got it right, you are able to update the ROM with updated
versions.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}5. Kickstart 1.3 with 2.0+ Features@{fg text}@{bg background}
Add features from later Kickstart versions (like 2.0 or 3.1) to older ROMs 
(e.g., 1.3), such as improved filesystem support or better memory 
management.

#Point 5:
In theory this is possible, as one user on EAB commented they have seen users
have added the SCSI.device to 1.3 ROMs.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}6. Add Filesystem Support@{bg background}@{fg text}
Patch the ROM to include additional or updated filesystem drivers, such as 
support for FAT32, large partitions, or more efficient filesystems like PFS 
or SFS.

#Point 6:
Ahh, another red flag again, the file system is contained on the harddisk in
the RigidDiskBlock (RDB) part. Think about when you update an Amiga harddisk
to Professional File System for example, this data is being copied to the 
hard disk not the ROM.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}7. Preloading Key Utilities@{fg text}@{bg background}
Integrate commonly used tools, such as HDToolBox or early versions of 
network drivers, directly into the Kickstart ROM.

#Point 7:
Add useful tools to the ROM, hmmm this does not seem possible, just 
considering the space limitations of the ROM would make this this just 
another AI "Hallucination".

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}8. Bug Fixes@{fg text}@{bg background}
Some Kickstart versions have known bugs. Community patches are available to 
fix these issues, especially for Kickstart 3.1 and earlier versions.

#Point 8:
Interesting this point, essentially what is it talking about is Kickstart 
3.2 which as you all know is now at version 3.2.2. Almost there ChatGPT.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}9. Decompressing or Compacting the ROM@{fg text}@{bg background}
Use tools to decompress a Kickstart ROM to analyze or modify its content. 
Conversely, you can compact modified ROMs for use in hardware with limited 
storage.

#Point 9:
As far as I know the Kickstart is not compressed, double checking about this 
on EAB confirmed that. Definitely getting into the zone of "hallucinations" 
now!

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}10. AmigaOS 3.2+ Updates@{fg text}@{bg background}
Official updates to Amiga Kickstart, like those introduced with AmigaOS 3.2 
or 3.2.2, bring quality-of-life improvements, better hardware support, and 
bug fixes. Community mods may replicate or extend these features.

#Point 10:
This seems redundant as we already have updated ROMs with each new release 
of OS3.2.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}11. Localization@{fg text}@{bg background}
Integrate support for additional languages, like adding localized keyboard 
mappings or language-specific libraries.

#Point 11:
Pointless, the entire reason we have Locale if for this reason and it is a
better solution since you can change and save your prefs, if this was kept 
in Kickstart you would be unable to save your settings.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}12. Custom ROMs for Emulation@{fg text}@{bg background}
Modify Kickstart ROMs for specific purposes in emulators like WinUAE or 
FS-UAE, such as enabling specific CPU or chipset configurations that aren't 
standard.

#Point 12:
This seems like a complete "hallucination" to me, enabling chipsets for 
example would be done via the UAE settings. Plus if, as we are, considering
this in a real Amiga, you are stuck with the chipset you have. We have dived
out of the real world and are firmly in the realm of AI "hallucinations".

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}13. Integration of 3rd-Party Libraries@{bg background}@{fg text}
Directly include libraries like warp.library, mathffp.library, or 
mathieeedoubtrans.library to improve mathematical operations or other 
specialized functions.

#Point 13:
Now we are finally back in the realm of reality, this has been done, an 
example are the ROMs that have the EIDE.device added so people can boot from
the faster TF1230/60 IDE port. However, it is rare to have libraries added
to the ROM.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}Tools for ROM Editing:@{fg text}@{bg background}
Remus: A tool for disassembling, editing, and reassembling Kickstart ROMs.
Phoenix: Allows for more extensive customizations, including adding or 
removing modules.
KickMaker: Helps to build custom ROMs for specific needs.
UAE ROM Scanner: Useful for testing compatibility with modified ROMs.
Remember to always work with legally obtained ROMs and respect copyright 
laws when modifying or distributing them.

With recommended software, you do have to be careful with ChatGPT, it can 
for the most give you accurate/correct answers, however there are times 
where it starts to make up stuff. I did an Internet research to see if any 
of the software I was recommended exists, as the first software 
recommendation in point one was incorrect.

Remus, is a real tool and still available for download.
=> https://www.doobreynet.co.uk/

Phoenix does not appear to exist according to my searches, however if I am
wrong in this please contact the magazine so I can update this in the next
issue.

KickMaker also does not come up in my searches, so another "hallucination"
but again if I am wrong please contact the magazine so this can be
rectified in the next issue.

WinUAE ROM Scanner, I am not sure what ChatGPT is trying to say here, from
what I know you can set up WinUAE to scan for ROMs upon starting WinUAE but
I do not use a PC and use FS-UAE on the Mac instead. If anyone knows more
about this please contact the magazine.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

It seems like AI has suddenly become a very large part of our lives, while 
it has existed in various forms via video games, content suggestion and
internal application support, ChatGPT was the first time we got a form of
AI that represents what we have seen and read in science fiction. While it
is undeniable that AI is here and will is already helpful in our lives
we still need to careful. Imagine someone doing a report on retro computers
for school and chose the Amiga. They will have had no experience and most
likely will choose ChatGPT. The information they will get will be incorrect
but they will be unaware of having received incorrect data. As we put more
content onto the net, content that has been created with AIs that get their
information from the Internet, we will create a sort of feedback loop where
AI will be creating answers and content based on the content that was 
created by it in the first place and then posted to the Internet. In a way
you could say that AI will start eating itself, a terrifying though for
the future.

While I do not paint a rosy picture of the future with AI, I still do 
believe in its potential.

I use ChatGPT to support my lessons, though I always have to double check 
the spelling and sentence structure when it creates some text for me. In my
case I deal with learners who have dyslexia and often need to create 
sentences or game ideas and when I am overburdened ChatGPT has been helpful
but it also has given incorrect spellings and sentences that lack nuance 
and meaning. For me ChatGPT is a good way to get new ideas but it is 
something that I do not trust and always have to double check its output.

@node pixelart "Increase interest in your pixel art"
@toc articles
=============================================================================
@{b}Increase interest in your pixel art@{ub} - by: @{"Roald Strauss" link roaldstrauss}
=============================================================================

I'm a big fan of multiplatform releases. I like how WhatIFF? Magazine can be
experienced on both Amiga and modern phones, tablets, and computers online
via @{"The Amiga Workbench Simulation" system "openurl https://www.taws.ch"}. I also
like that it now includes an option of playing background music while
reading, as well as a "Dark Mode" option, thus offering multiple variants of
the magazine. By being available on multiple platforms while offering such
preference options, it becomes interesting to a bigger group of readers.

Similarly, I also find it cool when game-developers create their games for
multiple platforms. It is for this reason that I, as a musician, enjoy
making multiple filetype versions of my tracks, so they can be used by
gamedevs targeting different platforms.

I wrote an article about this back in WhatIFF? Magazine issue 2.11 called
"@{fg highlight}Custom Music vs Stock Music@{fg text}". Instead of just creating an
MP3 file, I also export and convert to as many other formats as possible,
such as XM, MOD, MIDI, SNESMOD etc. I even offer some of these filetype
versions in different qualities / filesizes. The MOD version, for example,
is often offered in both a high quality 14-bit version, as well as a medium
and low quality 8-bit version, thus logically matching different limitations
and constraints of various platforms.

Here over a year later, I'd like to revisit this topic; "multiple versions
of your art", but this time focusing on another art form: Pixel graphics.

Looking back, I have to acknowledge that the only reason I've been selling
the amount of licenses I have for my music, is exactly because my tracks
have been available in multiple filetype versions. I can especially thank
one particular variant of these "exotic" filetypes. @{fg highlight}The Amiga Protracker MOD
format@{fg text} is without a doubt the filetype I'm getting the most requests for.
Not from Amiga developers though. It's mostly been from Atari Jaguar
developers. But that is besides the point. The point is that it has paid
off for me (and the gamedevs too of course) to create and offer different
filetype versions of my tracks.

So what does this have to do with graphics? Well, in short: If this approach
works for music, then it should logically also work for graphics, don't you
think? Perhaps even more so, since the demand for pixel art seems to be much
higher than the demand for music. At least that's the impression I'm getting
when browsing the various gamedev related Discord servers and forums here
and there. The amount of requests for pixel graphics and artists seem to
outnumber the requests for music and musicians at least 10 to 1.

When hanging out on these creative sites, I often see graphics artists (as
well as musicians) scouting for a team too hook up with, and/or a game
project to become a part of. But I rarely see anyone actually hooking up,
despite them being rather persistent about it. Finding a good match isn't
something you just do. And that's one of the reasons why I instead prefer
to just do my music when I want how I want. Then the right gamedevs can
find my tracks on IndieGameMusic.com and request a license. Overall less
time demanding for all, cheaper for the gamedev and less frustrating for
me.

I'm thinking there must be pixel artists out there who'd like that too? 
Instead of wasting time searching for customers, just spend the time doing
whatever art you feel like doing, whenever you feel like being creative, in
whatever style that intrigues you at the time. Then convert to multiple
palette versions to increase the number of potential customers. Put all
versions on display online and wait for the right gamedev to find you.

I see a lot of pixel artists posting examples of their work here and there
already. Quite often rather impressive huge tile sheets, which they've
clearly put a lot of work and time into. And it's usually done with a
rather limited palette; only a few colours used, just like pixel graphics
@{i}should@{ui} be.

Unfortunately, the colours used are often picked from a 24-bit palette,
and most of the classic platforms can't display that many colours, which
means that the graphics simply aren't compatible with these classic
platforms. And I think that's a shame, because the developers on these
classic platforms are obvious potential customers for pixel graphics. It is
after all where pixel graphics originated from. And all of those graphics
@{b}could@{ub} be made compatible with a lot of these classic platforms
with very little effort.

And we're not just talking about a handful of more potential customers.
Almost all of the classic platforms has had active communities for decades.
And quite a lot of games are still being released for all of them too,
because of annual gamejams taking place in each community nowadays. So
supporting these classic platforms should logically result in a noticeable
increase in potential customers for your pixel art.

This will of course mean that your customers might not come from the 
platform you imagined. But does that matter? Personally, I'm happy as long
as my tracks get used in a game on any platform. I really don't care what
platform it is, do you?

@{b}Developer's motivation@{ub}
I recently created a post on a retro game developer forum, asking the
developers what made them keep the motivation to develop games for the
classic platforms. The replies can be summarised into 12 statements:

1.  Having tools to speed up the boring parts of the development

2.  Being able to create releases for multiple target platforms with
    relative ease  

3.  Receiving a cup of coffee, or some other token of appreciation every
    now and then; a sale or donation or even just positive feedback for a
    game they created  

4.  Being able to continue the work on the game quickly whenever there's a
    little free time available  

5.  Having fast'n'easy access to stock assets like music and graphics,
    and/or be in contact with artists who will and can deliver assets

6.  Having fast'n'easy access to look-up knowledge databases, and/or be
    in contact with other people who can help out  

7.  Being challenged technically and creatively (just enough to still be
    able to solve everything)  

8.  Achieving technical results that people didn't think was possible /
    haven't seen before on the particular platform  

9.  Being allowed to do things his own way, without being told to do
    things differently. This goes for both the developer, musician and
    artist  

10. Finding a project where (almost) all parts are interesting  

11. Avoiding pressure from people who are impatient for the project to
    be completed: Don't announce the project before it's (almost)
    complete  

12. Preventing piracy of the finished project  

Number 5 was particularly interesting. It essentially tells us that we
as artists can in fact motivate developers to make more retro games,
simply by creating and offering stock assets to them. Your graphics might
even be the very thing that inspires them to get started on a project!
In other words, you can potentially create your own customers simply by
being creative and offering the world your creations.

And by making different versions of your graphics, it'll increase chances
of matching a game project. Most pixel artists are already halfway there:
You've already limited the number of colours used. So all you need to do
now is to replace those colours with colours that are actually available
on each platform. The only question is: How much are you willing to change
your original graphics? That's often a matter of pride. Personally, I'm
okay with a lower quality version of my music existing, as long as there
also exists a higher quality version.

@{b}Which classic platforms can we expand to?@{ub}  
A few of the classic platforms do actually offer a 24-bit palette. For
example; @{fg highlight}Atari Jaguar@{fg text}, @{fg highlight}Nintendo 3DS@{fg text}, @{fg highlight}Amiga AGA@{fg text}, @{fg highlight}Sega Dreamcast@{fg text}, and
@{fg highlight}Sega Saturn@{fg text}. And let's just throw in the @{fg highlight}Nintendo 64@{fg text} as well, even though 
it technically only displays a 21-bit palette. So your graphics are already 
usable on those platforms, without making any changes to them.

Posterising your 24-bit graphics down to a lower level, so it becomes  
compatible with older devices, won't present a huge difference at first  
either. At 18-bit (262,144 possible colours) you can add the @{fg highlight}Nintendo DS@{fg text}
and @{fg highlight}VGA/SVGA platforms@{fg text} to the list, and it's doubtful you'll be able to
see any significant difference in your graphics, despite going from a  
palette of 16.8 million possible colours to "only" 262,144 possible colours.

At 16-bit (65,536 possible colours) you can include the @{fg highlight}Sharp X68000@{fg text}.
And going further down to 15-bit (32,768 possible colours), you can add  
the @{fg highlight}Super Nintendo@{fg text}, @{fg highlight}Gameboy Color@{fg text}, @{fg highlight}Sega 32X@{fg text}, and @{fg highlight}MSX2+@{fg text} developers 
to the list of potential customers.

Keep in mind that even though the platforms are capable of displaying  
all of these colours, there's also a limitation on how many distinct  
colours they can show on the screen at the same time. So far this number  
has been above 255, except for the @{fg highlight}Gameboy Color@{fg text}, which can only show
56 simultaneous colours on the screen.

At 12-bit (4,096 possible colours) we find the @{fg highlight}Atari STE@{fg text}, @{fg highlight}Amiga OCS@{fg text}, 
@{fg highlight}Apple IIGS@{fg text}, @{fg highlight}Game Gear@{fg text} and @{fg highlight}Amstrad Plus@{fg text}. The number of
simultaneous colours is now down to just 16 and 32. At this level, you 
should also note that the @{fg highlight}Amstrad Plus@{fg text} only has a resolution of 160x200 
pixels - and each pixel is double as wide as the height (2:1 ratio).

However, it also offers 16 hardware sprites at 16x16 pixels in a 1:1 ratio
with its own 16-colour 12-bit palette. So at this level, the conversions
begin to be a bit more complex.

Then we reach the 9-bit group (512 possible colours), which consists
of @{fg highlight}Atari ST@{fg text} (16 simultaneous), @{fg highlight}Sega Genesis / MegaDrive@{fg text} (61 simultaneous), 
@{fg highlight}MSX2@{fg text} (256 simultaneous), and @{fg highlight}TurboGraphX-16@{fg text}
(482 simultaneous).

At 8-bit (256 possible colours) we find the @{fg highlight}Enterprise@{fg text} (16 simultaneous
colours), and at 6-bit (64 possible colours) there is the @{fg highlight}Sega Master
System@{fg text}, which can show 31 simultaneous colours, and @{fg highlight}EGA platforms@{fg text}
which can show 16 simultaneous colours.

Can we go lower? Yes, we can! The @{fg highlight}Amstrad CPC@{fg text} has a palette of just
27 colours, of which it can show 16 simultaneous colours in a resolution
of 160x200 pixels in a 2:1 ratio. The @{fg highlight}Commodore 64@{fg text}, with 16 colours, can
show all 16 at the same time in the same resolution as the @{fg highlight}Amstrad CPC@{fg text}.
Though it has some other restrictions regarding the number of simultaneous
colours in each 8x8 pixels. The @{fg highlight}Commodore 64@{fg text} also offers hardware sprites
of 24x21 pixels single colour, or 12x21 pixels 2:1 ratio 3-colour sprites,
of which 2 colours must be shared across all sprites. And the @{fg highlight}Nintendo
Entertainment System@{fg text}, with a palette of 54 colours, can show 25 at the
same time.

As you can see, the further down the list we go, the more limited and
complex things become. So it's up to you to decide how much effort you
want to put into it, and pick the platforms you want to make your graphics
compatible with. The lower you go, the more platforms you'll cover, but
the conversion will also become more complex, and your graphics will look
increasingly different from the original. (Unless, of course, it was
designed with one of these small palettes from the start).

@{b}A few helpful tools@{ub}  
There are many conversion tools you can use for this kind of work. I'm
not going to make a huge list. Just mentioning a few: At @{"8bitworkshop.com" system "openurl https://www.8bitworkshop.com"}
there's an online tool called @{fg highlight}Dithertron@{fg text}, which will convert an image
to various classic platforms. @{fg highlight}GrafX2@{fg text} is another tool that many pixel
artists use to create or convert graphics when targeting these classic
platforms. @{fg highlight}ConvImgCPC@{fg text} is a converter specifically for converting images
to the Amstrad CPC and Amstrad Plus.

You can also download palettes for the various older platforms, install
them in @{fg highlight}GiMP@{fg text}, and then convert images to each palette by indexing your 
high-res pictures while applying dither.

@{b}Where's the gold?@{ub}  
So the next question is, of course: "Which platforms are worth the effort?",
probably thinking it must be the ones that have the most active homebrew
scene. Logically, whichever platforms have the most annual game releases
must be the ones worth targeting, in order to get a higher chance of a sale,
right? Well yes, but that's not my own personal experience. It also
depends on how many other eager artists the platform already has, and
whether your style happens to match an ongoing game project on that
platform.  

But let's just list a few stats for 2024 anyway. Number of game releases per
platform in 2024:

Platform             |   # | Source  
---------------------+-----+----------------------
Amiga                |  38 | lemonamiga.com
Amstrad CPC/Plus     |  60 | cpc-power.com
Atari ST/TT/Falcon   |  23 |  
Commodore 64         | 121 | lemon64.com
DOS                  |  30 | DOS (CGA/EGA)
MSX                  | 250 | msxgamesworld.com
Sega Master          |  32 | smspower.org

A brief look at that short list would suggest that MSX is "the" platform
to target, since it had 250 game releases in 2024.

@{b}But@{ub}: The developers I am personally getting the most requests from,
come from a platform with only a few annual game releases. So your
customers won't necessarily come from the most active platforms. They
may come from whatever platform you decide to support, by creating a
version of your artwork that's compatible with that particular platform.
We never know where a potential match resides.

@{b}A few examples@{ub}  
Curious to see how much effort it would take to do such graphics
conversions, I did a couple of tests myself: I tried converting 2 images
and a spritesheet. (Spritesheet taken from @{"Ukko's Journey" system "openurl https://www.ukkosjourney.com"}). The results can 
be found in the Coverdisk folder of this issue, and one of the examples 
can also be seen at @{"imgur.com" system "openurl https://imgur.com/a/Vn6XGPF"}

@{i}(My apologies to the sensitive people for using an AI-generated image
for one of the examples. It was my very first (and probably also last)
time ever using an AI-generator. I'm no artist myself, and I needed an
image I could use for the experiment, so...)@{ui}

Conclusion: It really didn't take much effort to do the conversions. In
fact, it was so easy to do that I'm having difficulties understanding
why we aren't seeing pixel artists doing this more. Real artists would
of course want to polish the results to make them even better, but it's
still my impression that the whole thing is a rather effortless process.

The vision I imagine with the examples I created, is that the developer
must add the title of the game, as well as credits info, and then use
the image either as a loading/splash screen or a title screen for his game.

@{b}Offer an attractive license model@{ub}  
Your artwork is now targeting all the gamedevs on a wide range of classic
platforms. Including a bonus group of gamedevs: The ones who are interested
in creating their game for multiple platforms. Especially if one license
covers all palette versions. That's what I do with my music: Developers
who buy a non-exclusive resale license for the MOD version of my track,
are also allowed to use the high-quality WAV version for marketing videos,
or use the WAV file to create an audio CD with the game's soundtrack, to
include with the physical edition of the game. And if the developer wants
to create and release the game for both @{fg highlight}Amiga@{fg text} + @{fg highlight}Super
Nintendo@{fg text} + @{fg highlight}Nintendo 64@{fg text} + @{fg highlight}MS-DOS@{fg text}, then he's free to use the MOD and SPC and XM 
and MIDI version of my track with a single license. For me, a non-exclusive 
resale license covers a game title regardless of how many platforms and 
filetypes.

@{i}(It's another thing with the @{fg highlight}platform @{b}exclusive@{ub} license@{fg text} though.
That one has to be paid per platform - @{b}if@{ub} the developer wants 
exclusivity that is). It's good to offer options.@{ui}

So you can do that too: Grant a single license permission to use @{b}all@{ub}
palette versions of the graphics for the project, no matter how many  
platforms the game is released for. This will make your assets more 
attractive. Even if the game developer ends up only making a @{b}single@{ub} version
of the game, the fact that all the graphics (and music) is @{b}available@{ub} for
multiple platforms might be the very thing that makes the developer choose
your assets instead of other offers.

@{b}Offer 24-bit high resolution posters@{ub}  
And that brings me to another thing the graphics artist can do to become
even more attractive: Create your title/splash screens in 24-bit high
resolution, and then scale down for the low resolution platforms. Because
that way you'll be able to offer the retro developer a high-quality poster
for his game, which he can choose to include as a large printed physical
version in a physical edition of his game.  

Some of these retro gamedevs quite enjoy making physical editions of their
games, and include all sorts of accessories with it. It's all part of the
fun for them. So by offering this option from the start, it will make your
assets pack even more attractive.

@{b}Consider even more palette versions@{ub}  
This article has focused on how to target more platforms with your pixel
graphics, by adjusting the palette to become compatible with the classic
platforms. But there is also another way you can increase the interest in
your pixelart with multiple palette versions: By making different lighting
variants of your graphics. If you created a spritesheet with daytime 
lighting, then also create a variant with nighttime lighting. That way it'll
become attractive to two gamedevs with different settings in mind - and/or
those who wish to have both settings available in the same game.

@{b}Wrapping up@{ub}  
Since you're still reading this, I assume you're beginning to see the  
potential advantage in offering multiple versions of your pixelart. So  
the only thing we have left to figure out now is: Where do you display  
your artwork in all of these different palette versions?  
And that is indeed a good question. Because I sadly don't know of any  
site that offers such a detailed indexation of artwork. And I don't  
expect anyone will ever be making such a site either. (Never say never  
of course). The only reason musicians like myself have a site like  
@{"IndieGameMusic.com" system "openurl https://www.indiegamemusic.com"} that offers such a detailed indexation and advanced 
search options for music, is because it was made by some geeky nut with a 
big passion for it. (Yours truly).
  
So I don't really see any other options for you than to keep using the
sites you're already using, and simply start adding names and search
tags of compatible platforms to your entries, so that they have a chance
of being found by gamedevs on those platforms.  
If there happen to be another geeky nut out there with a large amount
of passion for stock graphics in many forms, he/she has my full support
and encouragement to start creating IndieGameGraphics.com :-)

Good luck with all your projects in the future!

@node robcranley "Rob Cranley Interview"
@toc talkingamiga
=============================================================================
@{b}Interview: Rob Cranley - SOLAS Board @{ub} by @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

@{b}1. Hello Rob, thank you for agreeing to this interview, to start with can
you tell us about yourself?@{ub}

My pleasure! I'm Rob, originally from Ireland but currently living in
Scotland. I'm an engineer with a background in automation and control
systems, and I work developing medical devices. My previous job involved
some robotics and automation work, so a bit of hardware, software and
firmware development, but my current job is more towards the materials
engineering side of things. My Amiga hobby helps keep that coding and
electronics part of my brain going.

I was always interested in electronics and coding, and started out both at
an early age, first on my school's BBC Micro and then on my own Atari 800XL.
Experiments as a 12-year-old building DIY add-ons for the poor Atari didn't
end well, and it ended up damaged. As a result, I ended up getting an Amiga
as a replacement, and have been using them ever since. (You'll be glad to
know that I recently rescued that old Atari from my parents' attic and
repaired it, and it's now fully working!)

@{b}2. You created the SOLAS board, can you explain what it is and does?@{ub}

Solas (Irish for light) is a small board that's intended to fit on the Amiga
1200 clockport. The primary function is to give the Amiga the ability to
control RGB LEDs, similar to those commonly found in modern gaming PCs. It
uses standard connectors commonly used on PC motherboards (often called
ARGB, 5VDG or other names) and communicates with the LEDs using the same
protocol, so standard PC LED strips, fans and so on can be controlled. The
controller on Solas will display the LED patterns autonomously; software on
the Amiga side is only required to change the settings (e.g. the pattern,
colour and speed of the LEDs), or to access some of the extra functions it
has to offer.

Through the magic of feature-creep, Solas ended up with many other features
too. It has inputs for temperature sensors, a fan speed controller, a
clockport splitter, an audio input (so that Solas can make the LEDs react to
audio), and an i2c port which lets you attach various small devices such as
LCD screens, environmental sensors and more. The LCD can be used to display
the readings from the temperature sensors, as well as messages sent from the
Amiga.

On the software side, there's a main control program that lets you adjust
the settings, as well as a commodity for reporting the temperatures and
controlling the fan speed, and an ARexx host to allow the use of ARexx to
control Solas. The software is mostly finished and usable, but there are
still tweaks happening and so there might be more features added in the
future...

@{b}3. You have gone through several iterations of the board, how different is
the current version from the first release?@{ub}

Well, it depends on how you look at it. In basic terms, the major functions
are all the same, but the first couple of versions were essentially
prototypes. The first version even uses a different controller chip! But
most of the changes beyond that are small - things like adjusting the shape
to accommodate some Indivision boards, switching to a 4-layer PCB and fixes
for edge cases that were discovered by various beta testers. There were bus
issues that only showed up with certain accelerators, for example, and were
due to a combination of shortcuts taken by some accelerator makers and
incorrect assumptions on my part.

In total there have been 7 versions of the PCB, and I'm hoping I have all
the major hardware issues sorted by now.

@{b}4. The SOLAS is quite a unique product what gave you the idea to create it?@{ub}

Solas started out as a very simple project. One of my friends in the
Scottish Amiga user group asked me if I could add a 5V power connection
inside his A1200 to connect to a Bifrost to enable the high brightness
modes, and also to allow him to connect some other LEDs internally. No
problem, I said. But it was during the Covid lockdown so I had a bit of time
on my hands, and very quickly the project changed from being a small cable
adaptor for the floppy drive power connector to a PCB. Once it reached that
point, I thought about having the Amiga control the LEDs, and for that,
connecting it to the clockport made sense.

I've always enjoyed programming PIC chips, and so I chose one that suited
connecting to the clockport. Once I had that chip, I realized there were
many pins left unconnected, and started thinking about what else I could use
them for. Temperature sensors were an obvious one, as was the audio
sampling, and I kept adding more functions until I had used up most of the
pins.

Because the board had some 5V and 12V power pins exposed, there was a risk
of short circuits causing some serious damage inside the Amiga. To reduce
this risk, I decided it would be best to have the board mounted directly on
the A1200 motherboard. That way it had a "proper" location and wouldn't need
some other method of securing it inside the Amiga case. But since there are
lots of other devices out there that also connect to the clockport, I felt
it was a good idea to integrate a clockport splitter on the board as well,
something I first built in the '00s to allow me to run a Catweasel and a
HyperCOM 3 card at the same time.

@{b}5. Were you confident in there being a market for it?@{ub}

To be honest, I didn't really think about it that much. RGB lighting isn't
really something I'm big into myself - I don't mind it, but it doesn't 
bother me either way. The main plan was to just build a few, mainly for the 
original friend who wanted the LEDs and other local Amiga users who liked 
it. But most of the people who saw the prototype working did say that there 
would be a lot of interest in it, and so there is!

@{b}6. What difficulties did you encounter during development, if any?@{ub}

Well, I already touched on one of the issues regarding certain accelerators
and bus timing, but there were lots of other little bumps along the
development road. Another issue arose when trying to control the LEDs
themselves. The PIC chip chosen for the board is reasonably powerful and 
runs at 32MHz, but normal C code was too slow to reliably communicate with 
the LEDs, which use a very tightly timed bitstream to set the RGB values of 
each LED in turn. I eventually solved it by using assembly for the timing-
criticalLED refresh routines, and it's been fine ever since. This timing 
does mean the LED refreshes always get the highest priority, and other 
communication has to be paused briefly, which meant the communication with 
the host Amiga over the clockport had to be carefully managed.

@{b}7. Since the release of the A1200.net translucent cases have you seen an
increase in interest?@{ub}

Yes, I think so! There has been a steady stream of interest since I started
showing Solas to the world, but I really noticed it at the Kickstart show in
the UK. There were a number of people with the new coloured "Asahi" cases
there, and they were all asking me about getting one. Unfortunately I didn't
have the boards available at the time, but I think most of them have one 
now.

@{b}8. Was it necessary to modify the boards in any way to fit the newer cases?@{ub}

No, Solas is mainly designed to fit directly on the motherboard and doesn't
really interact with the case itself, so no adjustments were necessary. But
since it was released I've had quite a few people ask me about versions for
different cases, like Checkmate cases and big box Amigas...

@{b}9. Currently the SOLAS is only available for the A1200, do you have plans to
make versions for the A500, A600, or even big box Amigas?@{ub}

I didn't initially, because it was so tied to being physically mounted on 
the A1200 clockport. But so many people asked me about it that I modified 
some of the beta boards to be used with a clockport cable instead. 
Electronically, there's no difference, but connecting with a cable means it 
can be mounted anywhere and connected to any clockport, including the 
various adaptors available for the A500 and A600, and the clockports 
commonly found on Zorro cards. Some software changes were required, but 
Solas works with all of these extra clockports that have been tested.

Mounting the board is a key consideration for such setups however, because 
of the danger of shorting out the power rails to other parts or the case, 
and there are so many different possibilities that it's impossible to suit 
every situation. There are mounting holes in the PCB though that can be used 
to mount it on suitable spacers or similar. Recently though, a guy going by 
the handle of Kavanoz has created an ISA card specifically for mounting 
Solas. It fits in the mostly unused ISA slots that are present in many big-
box Amigas, and provides a safe way of mounting Solas. A clockport 
connection is still required using a cable to a nearby Zorro card, but power 
is provided through the ISA slot. A small modification to Solas is needed 
for this to work (moving some connector pins to the rear of the board, but 
nothing too complicated.

@{b}10. Do you have plans for additional features?@{ub}

Yes and no. The hardware is more or less feature complete, but there are a
few things on the to-do list on the software and firmware side. One big 
thing is to start using interrupts for communication with the Amiga. This 
will mean data transfers can be faster and more reliable, but the current 
system works well enough for most uses so it's a long-term goal. I also want 
to add support for more i2c devices, and ideally develop a driver library 
for it that's compatible with the de facto standard i2c.library API that's 
used for some other i2c implementations on the Amiga. This would allow 
compatibility with any devices supported on those other controllers. But a 
particular i2c module I'm hoping to add support for is one to measure 
voltages and power consumption internally, so the PSU output can be 
monitored through software on the Amiga side.

Other long-term goals on the software side include creating a standard API
for RGB lighting, and another for temperature sensors, thus opening the 
door for anyone to write software that supports sensors on new accelerators, 
other clockport temperature modules, i2c sensors and so on. All I need is 
time ;) Or someone who can write library code to volunteer for the job.

@{b}11. Have you ever been surprised at how people have been used the SOLAS?@{ub}

I think most people use it for the main features, but there are a few
surprising uses I've heard of out there. One of the early adopters wasn't
interested in the LEDs at all, and only used it for monitoring temperatures
and controlling a fan. There's another user who has two Solas boards in his
A1200 tower, I think one is daisy-chained off the clockports of the other.
There are lots of RGB fans and LED strips in that machine!

And, possibly my favourite, but one of the Scottish Amiga users added an
external LED connector to the case of his Amiga and spread a long length of
LEDs across his room!

@{b}12. Beyond the SOLAS do you have other hardware projects planned?@{ub}

I always have so many projects (hardware and software) in my mind, but never
have enough time to get to them all. But there are two projects that I
currently have at early prototype stage. One is a pair of wireless modules
that allow you to use classic Amiga peripherals wirelessly. There are
adaptors that let you use wireless USB keyboards, mice and controllers, but
this project (which I've tentatively called "AirJoy") lets you use your old
Zipsticks, CD32 pads, tank mice and original Amiga keyboards by plugging 
them into a battery-powered sender module, and plugging a receiver module 
into the relevant ports on the Amiga. I have prototype modules built, and 
they generally work quite well, with minimal lag and around an 8-hour 
battery life using a mobile phone-style battery and USB-C charging.

The other project I have in the early stages is a board that adds an
Amiga-style clockport to the Atari 800XL, allowing it to use Solas and lots
of other clockport hardware. It connects to the PBI bus, and could probably
be adapted to work with the 1090XL busboard project, as well as the XE-
series machines.

@{b}13. If people wish to purchase a board how can they get in contact with you?@{ub}

I'm currently doing a slow roll-out of the first batch of manufactured
boards. In the future they might be available through various Amiga
distributors, but for now I'm handling the kitting and shipping myself. I've
recently cleared my waiting list though, so I'm happy to take requests from
people for boards. I've just put together a webpage that details the various
options available. People can submit their request there and I'll get back 
to them to finalise the order. The address is
https://robthenerd.com/getsolas/solasconfig.php and the Solas project page
can be found at https://robthenerd.com/solas

@{b}14. Thank you for your time Rob, before we finish do you have any final
words?@{ub}

Having seen the Amiga fade away from use, it's amazing to see the huge
resurgence of interest in the system as a part of the overall wave of
interest in retro computing, and the explosion of activity in the Amiga
community is nothing short of incredible. Twenty years ago, Amigas were
getting thrown in the bin, and nobody would have thought there would be such
a vast array of new hardware, games, software, user groups and publications
(both digital and printed). It's a great time to be an Amiga fan!

Thank you for the questions, and keep up the great work with WhatIFF.

@node paulvince "Paul Vince Interview"
@toc talkingamiga
=============================================================================
@{b}Interview: Paul Vince - Amiga Game Selector (AGS) @{ub} by @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

@{b}1. Hello Paul, thank you for taking the time for this interview, to start 
with can you tell us a bit about youself?@{ub}

Well I'm a pretty un-interesting 54 year old from Slough in England. If you 
don't know anything about Slough, it has a Mars Bar factory, the UK version 
of the Office TV series was based here and it's about 3 miles from Windsor, 
where the King lives.

Me, I am a bit of a techy kind of guy. I've had computers since the 70's and 
my life outside work pretty much of revolves around them.


@{b}2. How did you get started with the Amiga?@{ub}

I started on the Sinclair ZX81, then a TI99/4a and then a couple of ZX 
Spectrums; the 48k+ and the 128k toastrack. What drew me to the Amiga was 
mostly games. I used to read the Spectrum magazines and see the adverts with 
the Amiga and ST graphics in them and I just had to have one. I chose the 
Amiga as it had better graphics and there was a good deal going at Silica 
Systems on the A500.

I got my A500 in 1988 with my first pay check from my first job. I got the 
ten star game pack, F/A18 Interceptor, Carrier Command and a 512kb RAM 
expansion. I'm sure it came to about 600. This got me hooked. I quickly 
expanded the system with an A590 hard disk and started programming, doing 
art and making music. I would never say that I was great, but I was OK.

In 1992 I got my A1200 from Diamond Computer Systems where I was working at 
the time. I still have this A1200 and it still works great. The A1200 took 
me to the next level with large hard disks, loads of RAM and AGA graphics. I 
got quite good at AMOS programming and made a few utilities and game 
concepts but never went much further as a few year later I built my first 
PC and the Amiga was mothballed.

@{b}3. You are the creator of the Amiga Game Selector, for those who do not
know about it, can you explain what it is and what it does?@{ub}

Amiga Game Selector (AGS) is a Workbench distribution and game launcher for 
the Commodore Amiga. It has the complete collection of WHDLoad games and 
demos from
Retroplay's collection which are accessed by a comprehensive and well 
organised set of menus. The launcher is pretty much all inclusive and the 
user can run all the included games and demos as well as the documentation, 
game database, emulators, docs disks, help files the complete collection of 
WhatIFF? guides without having to load Workbench.

The game launcher that I use is Arcade Game Selector 2 by Magervalp which is
a really flexible launcher that can use any Amiga screen mode and uses 
scripts to run everything from the menus. This allows for a lot of 
customisation of the launcher screen and also a lot of options for running 
software.

The Workbench side has a quite extensive collection of Amiga software and 
media files and uses standard Workbench 3.1. I decided early on to give the 
user an idea of what the Amiga can do, but to be a base systems that allows 
them to add their own stuff as well.

@{b}4.  When did you first start work on the AGS?@{ub}

My first project on the Amiga was a WHDLoad database and collection of 
screen shots and cover art. To make this I wrote a program that manages the 
process. This is written in Purebasic, which is a direct descendant from 
Blitz Basic.

I started this project just after lockdown 2020 when I got my old A1200 out 
of storage. I'd been out of the Amiga scene for 20 years and concepts like 
WHDLoad were completely new to me.

My database project morphed into a PC based WHDLoad launcher that uses Win
UAE.I was already quite familiar with WinUAE having written one of the first 
online tutorials for it in 2001.

Whilst making this WHDLoad collection, I started to play with Arcade Game 
Selector 2 and wrote some code that created a set of launch scripts for my 
WHDLoad games.

This sat on my PC until the A500 mini came out. I got my A500 mini on day 
one and me being me, I started to prod around the emulator and how it ran. 
Jimmy Johansson was doing the same thing with Aminimiga at the time and 
between us we managed to get the mini running workbench and other games. 
That's when I got the idea to port my AGS2 scripts and run them on the mini.

@{b}5. What was the inspiration behind AGS?@{ub}

AGS is completely fueled by my OCD and completionist attitude. I wasn't 
happy with the clunky A500 mini carousel and wanted to get a complete 
collection of games and demos on it that could be easily run. Having the 
WHDLoad images and database and quite a good idea on how to adapt the AGS2 
scripts meant that I had a working concept in a few weeks.

@{b}6. How long did it take to develop and did you develop it on the Amiga or 
PC/Mac?@{ub}

The A500 mini came out in 8th April 2022. I started AGS a week later and the 
first A500 Mini Game Selector came out on 29th April 2022. So about two 
weeks in total. If you include the database development, I started that in 
lockdown June 2020 so just under two years for everything.

All AGS development is done on Windows or in AGS itself. I use my own 
database manager to generate the scripts and images for the launcher. It 
also updates the whdload hdf file for the games and demos. I use Paint.net 
for the graphics, notepad ++ for text and I wrote my own graphics converter 
to change the png base images to iff. On the Amiga side I use mostly Deluxe 
Paint to remap the images for the AGS themes and tweak other graphics and of 
course Directory Opus for file management. Everything I use on the Amiga 
side to make AGS is included with the release versions of AGS.

@{b}7. What were some of the difficulties that you encountered during 
   development?@{ub}

Dealing with a 30 year old operating system is not easy. Things have moved 
on since 1992 and trying to make AGS work on all kickstarts and loads of
different hardware specs has been a challenge. One of the great advancements 
is the larger storage devices which takes away a lot of the challenges of 
trying to fit everything in.
                              
@{b}8. How has it changed/improved since you first started on the project?@{ub}

AGS has grown and improved in every version. The initial release was just a 
plain launcher that ran the whdload slave with no speed regulation. This 
changed to running the icon files which added over 200 utility and data 
disks (No other collection does this!). There's also now over 250 official 
launcher themes and another 300 third party ones.

Because AGS didn't access the included database on the A500 mini, it didn't
know to speed up or slow down the games that it ran. This meant that I had 
to test 4500 games and demos to manually set the speed of any software that 
was problematic.

The scripts have also become a lot more optimised and are designed to be 
cross platform. This means that I can use the same install on a real A1200 
as well as in WinUAE.

I'm still finding better ways of doing things and making the scripts easier 
to manage. Also the facebook group members are great with suggestions. 
Things like the favourites system and expert mode were all suggestions from 
the group. I just have to spend a few days thinking about the solution and 
99 times out of a 100 I find one.

@{b}9. Are there any additions or changes that you still wish to do?@{ub}

In terms of the launcher, I'd like to make an RTG big screen version for 
running on big TV's. There's also loads of extra media and content that I'd 
like to add. I also have a list of hundreds of new themes that I'll do as 
well. I'd also like to include a collection of proper CD32 games.

@{b}10. AGS has been released for the A500 Mini, Raspberry Pi models, UAE,
    real hardware and PiStorm, do you have other platforms that you hope
    to release AGS on, such as on consoles?@{ub}
	
The Retroarch version of AGS already runs on consoles that support files 
over 4gb. At the moment, I have it running on my Android phone, a Retroid 
Pocket 2s and my Steamdeck. I do want to make a FAT32 compatible version 
for handhelds like the PSP or Switch. AGS also runs on Mister as well. 

I have three targets in terms of Amiga operating systems. Workbench 1.3 
(using JOTD's JST launcher, CD32 with themed launchers and a standalone 
bootable image for running on PC's without having to load Windows.

@{b}11. There are a number of similar products to AGS, what do you think differs
    AGS over the others?@{ub}
	
Oh, there's loads! The launcher is the biggest thing. MegaAGS/AmigaVision is 
probably the closest system to AGS but lacks the layout, system regulation, 
custom themes, docs, emulators, extra games and more. Chris Edwards who 
makes PiMiga, has made it possible to run the AGS launcher in his 
distribution as it's so good.

The WHDLoad collection in AGS is complete. I haven't removed anything so 
you get all the foreign languages, all the different memory requirements, 
all the different chipset requirements and all the different supported 
systems.

Besides Retroplay's collection, AGS also includes over 500 extra games and 
demos including PD Games, Educational Games, RTG Games and a set of PC 
conversions like Doom and Quake (obvously I don't include the data files!).

There's a selection of emulators as well. You can run over 600 C64 games 
and 350 ZX Spectrum games direct from the launcher.

In terms of the Workbench side, AGS isn't as mature as say AmiKit or PiMiga. 
They are designed as complete solutions. AGS is designed as a base that you 
can expand on. It does better with the included content like the 11,000 
sound samples and the 36,000 mods but it only includes basic Internet access 
and doesn't have as much software on it in comparison. To be honest though, 
Amikit and PiMiga have been in development far longer than AGS, so they will 
obviously be better set up. 	

@{b}12. Where can users find the software and are there tutorials on installation
    available?@{ub}
	
Amiga Game Selector is available from www.amigagameselector.co.uk. There is 
extensive documentation included on how to install AGS. I've tried to make 
it as simple as possible. Most installation involve burning an image file or 
copying some files. After that everything is plug and play.

There is an official installation youtube video here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtW6tHOLvN0&ab_channel=EasyEmu

There are also dozens of videos made by my facebook group members that cover
installation and the basics of the launcher.

You can also buy ready made cards/sticks from www.retro32.com who are one of 
the AGS sponsors.

@{b}13. Thank you for your time and replies, before we finish do you have any 
    final comments or words?@{ub}
	
Firstly, thank you for letting me include the WhatIFF? collections with the
latest version of AGS. I'm sure that the users will find the articles really
interesting.

I also would like to thank the AGS community for their support over the last 
few years.

I guess that my final words are, if you ever loved gaming on the Amiga, AGS 
is a  pretty good way of reliving those moments. Oh, and it's completely 
free!

@{b}1. Timothy thank you for taking the time for this interview, to begin with, 
can you tell us about yourself?@{ub}

Not much to say really.   I'm 48 and I tinker with various projects.  Mostly 
lately I have been toying with cellular devices.

@{b}2. How did you get started with the Amiga?@{ub}

I got my first A1000 in 1987

@{b}3. What do you like about the Amiga most?@{ub}

Honestly it was my childhood.

@{b}4. You are working on updating Final Writer, did you work on other Amiga 
software prior to FinalWriter?@{ub}

No I did not.

@{b}5. How did you get involved in the FinalWriter update project?@{ub}

I tracked down Woody and negotiated an agreement we were both happy with.

@{b}6. In the UK Wordworth was the best regarded Amiga word processor, how was
FinalWriter viewed in the American Amiga scene?@{ub}

For me personally I came from Prowrite and migrated through the Final 
series.

@{b}7. Did you communicate with the original team or people from 
SoftWood?@{ub}

Yes I did. 

@{b}8. What features have you been adding to FinalWriter version 7?@{ub}

We've been mainly enhancing and modernizing older features. However we have 
added antialiasing, Network printing, real time spell checking.


@{b}9. How are you developing FinalWriter, i.e. on an Amiga or PC/Mac?@{ub}

It has been worked on by multiple developers so I cannot speak for them.

@{b}10. Currently the demo runs on AROS 68K/Apollo OS, are there plans to 
make a version for OS3.1/3.2 machines?@{ub}

Yes, there is.

@{b}11. Beyond the current version what other features do you want to 
add?@{ub}

Updated modern file formats.  Possibly an Updated GUI.

@{b}12. Currently there is a demo available and a version with the 
A600GS, is the A600GS, why did you decide to release it this way?@{ub}

It was an agreement between AmigaKit and I. However for me personally it 
made sense.

@{b}13. Do you have plans to release a physical version of FinalWriter, 
with printed manual and box?@{ub}

At some point I might.

@{b}14. Timothy, thank you for your time, do you have anything you would 
like to say before we finish the interview?@{ub}

I just hope everyone enjoys the changes we made.

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}

  My journey with the Amiga started in either '87/'88 when the family got an
  A500 (Back then it was a computer for the whole family), I remember the
  monitor and A500 boxes almost being as high as myself. Before this time I
  had only been exposed to the ZX Spectrum and C64, using the blue Workbench
  for the first time was an amazing experience. When I saw DigiPaint in
  action I could not believe my eyes. From that moment I was a devoted Amiga
  user going through various Amigas, A500+A570, A600, A3000 and A1200. Over
  the years my Amiga has been used to creating digital artwork and for
  making or shall I say trying to make music. Then in the year 2021 I decided
  for some crazy reason that the Amiga scene needed a digital magazine
  similar to Amiga Report. It was my intention to have something that picked
  up where the great Amiga magazines such as Amiga World and Amazing
  Computing left off, providing a more serious look at Amiga usage through
  tutorials and reviews.

  Steve enjoys doing impossible things on his Amiga 4000 and CDTV. Whether
  it's using his CDTV for email, playing Internet radio through his
  bluetooth speakers from his Amiga 4000, or talking to the world via the
  ISS from either. If people say the Amiga couldn't do it, he's probably
  looking for a way to do it. Steve writes his WhatIFF articles mostly
  using Arnor ProText.

  Like many Amiga users my first computer addiction was the mighty
  Commodore 64! One day close to Christmas of 1986 I drove to my local
  Commodore store called Comspec...I was in high school and played rep
  hockey at the time and didn't have the time I used to when I was in grade
  school to visit Comspec each weekend to check out the latest magazine and
  games. Imagine my surprise when I stepped into the store and immediately in
  front of me was THE AMIGA! It was looping the Defender of The Crown intro
  and I fell in love instantly! From that day on it was my mission to buy
  that Amiga but I had just worked a few part time jobs to help pay for my
  first ever used car and didn't have a hundred bucks to my name lol. The
  Amiga was close to $2,000 Canadian dollars (after taxes) and unlike my
  C64 my parents didn't fall for the 'I need it for school' rant again.

  To (try) to make a very long story short I didn't save up to buy my Amiga
  until I started University in 1989. In the mean time I saw another Amiga
  called the Amiga 500 at Comspec and it was a lot cheaper than THE AMIGA
  but my eyes and heart and soul were only set on THE AMIGA! When I finally
  bought it that was the proudest/happiest moment I've ever felt and I
  jumped straight into University with Excellence! word processor and
  Logistix spreadsheet/ database. In my 2nd year I bought my first ever
  hard drive, a whopping 33MB which had its own case which sat atop my
  Amiga 1000 case. Later fast ram side cars showed up and I mingled with
  Manx Aztec C compiler in computer science class. Of course all the great
  games with awesome music/sound effects made my Apple/PC friends envious!

  By my 3rd year we had a small Amiga computer club and a few of us got our
  first accelerator boards for our Amiga which was called LUCAS and was
  based on a design in a Transactor magazine. It had a 68020 at 16 MHz with
  FPU on it and it really helped out with the more complicated spreadsheets
  and compiling programs. Life was good, the Internet was just starting up,
  I graduated University and got my first full time job and then the bad
  news of Commodore going bankrupt hit the newspapers, magazines, and BBS
  boards! There was so much activity going on still in user groups and
  computer stores so us Amiga users just figured that it would sort itself
  out. At work  there were only PC's running AutoCAD and I despised using
  the early Windows systems and couldn't wait to get back home to my Amiga.
  Over the years busy with work and 'adult life' many of my Amiga friends
  moved on to PCs and I ended up getting my first Amiga 1200 and later
  Amiga 4000 for great prices. I was still amazed how the Amiga community
  was still active and so helpful up to the early 2000's. By then I was
  married and working harder than ever to save up to buy a home instead of
  renting an apartment and my Amiga's were left at my parents house until
  around 2010 or so I read about a brand new Amiga which was coming out
  based on PPC CPU called the AmigaONE X1000 running a new AmigaOS4. I was
  skeptical at first after hearing about the technical issues with the
  earlier SE, XE boards with the initisal AmigaOS4 release but after
  consulting with some friends I joined the beta test team to get one of
  the first X1000 boards and I immediately felt at home with AmigaOS4.1
  and have used it as my home Amiga ever since. Once I got some space set
  up in my house I got my Amiga's out of my parents house finally and
  eventually my original Amiga 1000 sits next to my AmigaONE X1000 and
  original C64 and of course my Amiga 1200 and 4000 came along too and with
  new accelerator cards and ram boards and spare motherboards and parts
  etc etc etc. Here I am today grateful to the Amiga computer and
  especially to the amazing Amiga community who back then and today has
  always been resilient, creative and helpful !

  My journey with the Amiga started around 1988, The first time seeing the
  Amiga 1000 in the shop window playing animations such as the @{b}Amiga Juggler@{ub}
  I fondly remember. My Brother and I saved up for an A500, and eventually
  bought an A4000 (cybervision 64 card) and then an A1200 with an 030
  accelerator. I loved collecting every Amiga Magazine with demo disks. My
  interest in game designing for the Amiga started with deluxe paint and
  I did dabble with @{b}The Miracle Keyboard@{ub} but that skill in music
  didn't last. It is because of the Amiga that I now work in video
  animation and game design.

  craft beats and basslines

  I was introduced to the Amstrad CPC464 at age 10, and had a great
  childhood because of all the BASIC coding I could do. I am also a
  musician. And when I discovered I could program my Amstrad to play 
  music,by inputting tons and tons of DATA lines, things became even more
  interesting.

  When everyone left the Amstrad CPC in favour of either the PC or Amiga,
  I stayed with my trusty CPC464 - until a couple of mates lured me over
  to the Amiga many years later. Since no one ever introduced me to 
  options like AMOS or Blitz Basic, it sadly meant that my coding days 
  were over - for a period of time anyway. Instead, I used my Amiga 600 
  for lots and lots of Protracker MOD creations.

  From 2012 to 2017 I wrote "8-bit Memoirs", which is a semi biography
  about those good old days. Download from @{"www.8bitMemoirs.com" system "openurl https://www.8bitMemoirs.com"}.
  (Use a download tool so you can resume).

  Nowadays, all these years later, I'm still just as creative as I've
  always been. I still create music - even Amiga Protracker MODs. And
  I'm still just as intrigued by (now retro) game-development as I was
  back in the day. My geeky hobby is to create my tracks in multiple
  different filetype formats, and offer licenses to gamedevs on many
  different platforms at @{"www.IndieGameMusic.com" system "openurl https://www.IndieGameMusic.com"}.

  Manical started making music for the Amiga in early 2021 (April) and has
  released at some demoparties, and is planning to go to more along the
  way. He's in the demogroups MoonShine and Hokuto Force as a musician, and
  soon to be a coder or graphician. He started out with Protracker for his
  first 3 mods, then moved to FastTracker primarily, and then he started
  exploring Impulse Tracker and started making tracks with Furnace. His
  songs have gotten good reviews by many famous people in the demoscene,
  such as Jammer, Purple Motion, Skaven, and cTrix (Most known for his
  gAtari). Since his music journey, he's entered Syntax 2021, Mysdata 2022,
  Boozedrome VI (Which his track that he entered ended up on the official
  Boozedrome tape which was limited to 50 copies).

  Like a lot of us I got my first computers during the late 80s and 90s,
  an exciting time for home computer owners. It seemed like every week
  brought something new and there were loads of computers and accessories
  to choose from. If you had the budget ;) My family had a Spectrum and
  then a BBC Micro but *my* first computer was an Amiga 500, all generous
  hand-me-downs from my uncle. I did play games of course - Lemmings,
  Pinball Dreams and Stunt Car Racer spring to mind but I also loved
  messing about in Deluxe Paint, eventually becoming half decently
  productive. I never had a console and I was never interested in truth,
  actually I don't think I really played on a console until my friend got
  a Playstation. An A500 Plus came next and then in March 93 I upgraded
  to an A1200 with a "huge" 80 MB harddisk!

  It was with the A1200 and its harddisk that I was really able to get
  into productive computing as well as enjoying the new AGA specific
  games.  I loved Animating with Deluxe Paint 4, I knew Wordworth inside
  and out got into generating fractal landscapes with VistaPro and 3D
  rendering with Real 3D. I would spend countless hours in Workbench,
  setting it up just the way I liked, I made my own icons very much
  inspired by MagicWB.  Soon enough I need more performance and added a
  Blizzard IV, Squirrel SCSI and CDROM and I figured out how to make an
  RGB cable for my specific telly. Still... After Commodore went
  bankrupt and the chances of a successor to the A1200 evaporated I saved
  up and was able to buy a secondhand A4000 complete with 1942 monitor.

  The A4000 was amazing, even more so when I loaded it with a Cyberstorm
  Mk-III and a Cybervision 64/3D (with scandoubler) and maxed out the
  RAM. I had a eventually got a 17" monitor and ran Workbench in an
  unimaginably spacious resolution - compared to 640 x 512 anyway. By
  this time I was a long time loyal Amiga fan and enjoyed simply upgrading
  and pushing the limits, way beyond anything my younger self could have
  imagined. My A1200 was rehoused in an Infinitiv tower case and even ran
  Linux, launched from within Workbench. My A4000 spent some time as a
  Mac thanks to ShapeShifter and was my first computer to go online with a
  56K modem! I knew I was fortunate to have these computers and upgrades
  and it was hard to leave them behind when I left the country.

  It's funny. Years pass, you forget things - you don't even realise you
  miss things and then someone releases a Mini A500 thingum and you start
  watching retro channels. Soon you end up on eBay and a week or two
  later you boot up an A500 for the first time in... Let's say a while. I
  kept nearly all of my Amiga gear, all apart from the very first A500 and
  A500 Plus. I was able to collect everything from my childhood home
  where it had been mostly stored safely all this time and bring it back
  with me. Now I have them again I hope to share my experiences with
  repairing, restoring and upgrading them with modern stuff over the
  coming months and years, maybe my trusty A4000 will boot once more!

  It was an amazing time to experience and I'm glad I can do so again with
  a fresh perspective.

  I got my first Amiga in October 1993, an Amiga 1200, which remains my
  favourite machine of all time. This machine was upgraded over many years
  until it was a fully towered, 060 powered, CD-ROM beast. It was in 2002
  that I needed a portable windows compatible for study reasons and so
  the real Amiga was left behind and eventually sold. It didn't take me
  long to download WinUAE though!
  
  Since then I have been emulating and keeping tabs on the scene, until
  2023 when I realised that nothing but the real thing would do and got
  hold of an A500 and then an A1200. I much prefer the A1200 in it's
  original case and have now upgraded with a TF1230/50, PCMCIA CD-ROM,
  PCMCIA Wireless card, GoDrive, External Gotek, MouSTer x2, RTC, CF Hard
  Disk, Amiga OS 3.2.
  
  It has been great getting the machine online, sending my first Amiga
  e-mail and browsing BBS boards - things I have always wanted to do.
  
  Looking forward to much more fun with my Amigas and writing for this 
  great magazine!
