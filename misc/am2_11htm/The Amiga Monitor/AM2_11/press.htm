FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 4th, 1998

Candidates announced for User Representative election

The Jay Miner Society (JMS) today released the official list of
candidates for the forthcoming election of a User Representative to
the Steering Committee of the Industry Council of the Open Amiga
(ICOA).  Voting began immediately.

The User Representative will have a full voting seat on the Steering
Committee for a period of one year, alongside the four seats for those
elected by ICOA members and a permanent non-voting veto seat occupied
by an Amiga Inc representative.  This position has been created to
ensure that the ICOA makes decisions that not only satisfy programmers
and manufacturers, but benefit Amiga users in general.  It combines
the roles of consumer advocate, opinion-gatherer, strategist and
community liaison.  The JMS and other user organizations will provide
support for this demanding job.

The candidates are:

    Bill Borsari <tekmage@wam.umd.edu>
    Craig Delahoy <craigd@ansonic.com.au>
    Harv Laser <harv@amigazone.com>

Voters can submit their votes at the JMS election web site

Statements by the candidates

Bill Borsari

Statement by Bill Borsari <tekmage@wam.umd.edu>

Hello friends,

As part of the election process, I have been asked to write a 500 word
statement regarding my candidacy. First, I am an American living in
Washington DC, USA.  Since 1993 I have been a member of the National
Capital Amiga Users Group.  During my membership I was elected
Chairman twice and Vice-chairman once.  I currently own two Amiga's
and work for my self doing computer repair including Amiga's with
Video Toasters.

My love for the Amiga started many years ago when my brother gave me
an A500 for my birthday.  Since then, my fondness for my Amiga and
it's users has grown.  Not to be one who idly stood by during the dark
days, I became more active in the local user group.  Moving beyond the
local group I have become active in the Amiga community on the
internet.  These contacts have provided me access to the hearts of
users, I have learned to listen and understand the opinions of many
different users from around the world.

In the last few years those voices have formed a chorus crying for one
thing, information.  In response I am working with the UGN to provide
the most information in the fastest ways.  With the recent
announcements from Amiga Inc. at the World Of Amiga show, the Amiga
world has changed forever.  Many have seen these changes as harmful to
the Amiga and were upset that the path chosen is not more traditional.
These annoucements have been more important then the ICOA and it's
members could have been imagined.  Their actions will lead the Amiga
out of the valley and in to the future.

I feel an intense desire to become the User Rep. to the ICOA. I see
that position as the only way I can ensure our Amiga will survive and
become what we all know it could be and what it should be!


Craig Delahoy
-------------
Election statement by Craig Delahoy <craigd@ansonic.com.au>

Thank you for taking the time to read this statement. I appreciate
your interest in my candidacy, but more importantly, I appreciate your
interest in the future of the Amiga.

The role of the user representative, as I see it, is primarily to keep
a reasonable amount of user and market practicality in the
discussions, so that things don't get bogged down in the technical
aspects (or potential) without regard (or with little regard) to those
to whom the product must finally be marketed. We need to ensure that
the Amiga will still be a user's machine.  Cutting-edge and
technically advanced, certainly, but if no one wants to use it, then
that effort is wasted.

In addition, the User Representative must be a means of communication
between the Steering Committee, ICOA, AI/G2K and the wider global
Amiga user community. A channel for receiving information from the
community and voicing it within the Committee, and a channel for
taking Committee information back out to the wider community.

The user representative needs to have a grasp of the technical side of
the Amiga - both hardware and software - in order to be able
understand the discussions taking place, and to provide meaningful and
informed opinion. I have that technical understanding.

The user representative must have an understanding and appreciation of
production, marketing and business considerations, in order to follow
those arguments and contribute to those discussions. I have that
marketing and business background.

The user representative should have a clear understanding of why the
Amiga was so successful originally, why it has remained successful
despite the collapses of all around her, and a strong and practical
vision of how the Amiga can reachieve that success and offer itself as
a viable alternative. I have that understanding, being an Amiga user
since 1987, and I have the vision - having developed several marketing
and promotion strategies during my work with David Pleasance and Colin
Proudfoot, and with John Smith.

The user representative must have strong established communication
skills - both personal and professional. They must be able to listen
to the users, understand their needs and desires, and be able to
convey those to the Committee. In addition, they must be able to
report back to the community at large in a coherent, literate and
professional way. I have an extremely strong background in the
communications industry, writing for film and television and
performing corporate communications in one of Australia's largest
export corporations.

As the market picks up again, the main purpose of the role will change
little, though the focus will become more of a contact point and
conduit for opinion and comments to and from the wider user community.
Recent announcements by Amiga Inc are encouraging, pointing to the
potential quantum leap that may take us back to the presitigious
position we once held.  The detail was sketchy, but the big picture
promising.  The vision is big, and the potential - if realised -
is more than encouraging. But just as important as the future of the
hardware platform is the future of the Operating System. Many times
recently I've heard the cry that the Operating System IS the Amiga,
and I am a very strong adherent to that school of thought.

I believe there is a very strong future for the Amiga Operating
System.  There is work to be done, but the potential rewards are
mind-boggling.

The only way that the Amiga can survive as a viable personal computer
platform (forgetting for a moment it's potential in other areas), is
to provide the product that the user wants and needs in a manner and
form in which they will choose it over a competitor.

That has to be the bottom line for the Amiga - it has to be a machine
that will sell. Not as a PC clone (there are too many of them out
there already, making too little margin), but as a viable, productive
and acknowledged alternative.

An Amiga on every desk would be a lovely dream, but not necessarily a
realistic one. I'd be happy to settle for an Amiga on every second
desk! :-)

I offer my services to you - the Amiga user community - as your
representative on the ICOA Steering Committee. I have sufficient
technical knowledge of the Amiga, of computers in general, and of the
wider information technology industry, to be able to understand and
make meaningful contributions to technical discussions.  I have strong
communications skills, and will be able to voice your concerns and
your opinions coherently, and to report back to you legibly.

But I am also one of you - an Amiga user, confident in the platform
itself, and with the vision, energy and motivation to make a real
contribution to securing it's future.


Harv Laser
----------
Election statement by Harv Laser <harv@calweb.com>

Harv Laser, 48, resides in Torrance, CA. USA and has been an Amiga
owner, user, sysop, writer and advocate since he bought his A1000 on
Oct. 7, 1985.  His current stable includes an A1200/030, an A2500/060,
a CDTV, and a mountain of peripherals, add-ons, accessories, and
software.

Harv has run the AmigaZone, an online service for Amiga owners since
1985.  (The Zone resided on the People/Link service from 1985-1991,
then moved to Portal from 1991-1996 and is now hosted by CalWeb
Internet Services.)

During those years, Harv has met, corresponded with, chatted and
interacted with and helped literally tens of thousands of Amiga owners
learn more about, and get more pleasure and productivity out of their
computers.  He's a frequent poster to Usenet newsgroups, and a
frequent denizen of the #amiga channels on IRC.

Harv's written a couple hundred Amiga articles, reviews, columns and
opinion pieces for over a dozen Amiga-specific magazines including
Amiga World, .info, Compute, Amazing Computing, Amiga+, AmNews, Amiga
Computing, CU-Amiga, Video Toaster User, AmigoTimes and many more.

Besides the just plain folks who own Amigas, Harv has known, dealt
with, beta tested for, and written manuals for many Amiga development
and product companies, and has met hundreds of developers over the
years, at the Amiga expos and shows he's attended, and at Amiga
DevCons.

The ICOA User Rep should not only be an Amiga devotee and advocate,
but be familiar with the developer community, and know the products,
what they can do, and the people who create them.

The ability to hear a user's problem or complaint, and then quickly
point them towards a solution is one of Harv's specialties.

The User Rep should have lots of contacts and associations, be able to
communicate effectively and with ease, and be a name familiar to the
Amiga community.  Harv qualifies on all of these counts.

                              ==============

                        Banquet Tickets Going Fast!
                        ---------------------------

Banquet tickets are going fast.  Place your order for a banquet ticket NOW
if you want to hear our guest speakers Petro Tyschtschenko, Jeff Schindler,
and Carl Sassenrath.  Only about 30 tickets are left.


                         AmiWest on Internet Radio
                         -------------------------

Our local Access radio stations, The Voice, Cable FM 88.7, and KYDS 91.5 FM
run an AmiWest PSA quite often.  The Voice is carried on the internet via
realaudio streaming audio from 9 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday.
Consequently, it also airs over KYDS 91.5 FM and worldwide on the internet.
The spot is considered "run of station" which means it has no scheduled air
time.  The station take three minute breaks, three times per hour.  These
breaks occur at :20, :40, and :57 past the hour.  Times are +/- 2 minutes.
The PSA is likely to run during one of those breaks.

Listeners worldwide may access the feed by obtaining the realaudio software
free fron the realaudio at http:  //www.real.com.  The feed can be heard on
the the Access Sacramento homepage (http://www.sacramento.org).  Once there,
one can click on the "live via realaudio" link which is located in the
middle of the page on the right, and the rest will happen automatically.

KYDS has plans to broadcast from the show.  There will be interviews of
various Amiga personalities at the show.  KYDS hopes to fire up the
realaudio encoder on Saturday and send the events and interviews from the
show floor around the world via the Access Sacramento site.


                                  Tickets
                                  -------

If you have not already done so, you should get your requests in for passes
to the show and for banquet tickets.  Remember that show passes are
available at a reduced rate if your check and mailed request is received by
July 1.  The advance ticket prices are:

        Full show pass (admission to show floor both days).....$12.
        One day pass............................................$8.

Passes do NOT include the banquet.  Banquet tickets must be purchased
separately.  Price is $25 per person and MUST BE PURCHASED IN ADVANCE.  You
can use one check to purchase both banquet tickets and admission passes.

A form in text format that can saved and/or printed has been provided on
the web page at http://sacc.org/amiwest/TICKETFORM.TXT for ordering tickets
for the show.  Since we are using a badge type of admission, you will not
receive actual tickets by return mail.  Instead you will receive an
acknowledgement that you have purchased the type of pass you requested.
You will present this at the admissions desk and will be given a show
information packet which will include your admittance badge and banquet
tickets that you have ordered.

The first 300 people ordering tickets will get a free issue of the latest
"The Informer" magazine.

Persons with advance tickets will have a special line to reduce waiting.
Your check(s) should be mailed no later than July 1st or there is a chance
that they will not arrive here in time for the show.

Please fill out a form for each person that wants tickets.  This will allow
us to print the name and affiliation for each person receiving a badge.

Send your check for admission pass and banquet tickets to:

            AmiWest '98
            c/o Sacramento Amiga Computer Club
            P.O. Box 19784
            Sacramento, CA 95819-0784

Make checks payable to "AmiWest".

Subject: World Map
Date: 28 May 1998 13:01:51 GMT

Hi dudes & dudettes,
We've started to plan the Amiga User Group World Map.
We need any and all existing user groups to give us a rough idea of
where/what  their "territory" is, so we can colour in the world maps
eg SEAL extend from East London (west) to Southend-on-sea (east), and
Chelmsford (north) to the River Thames (south). 
 If you could put a request on the Team AMIGA site, and the mailing
list, for said info, it would be great.
 Also, if I could suggest you send Amiga Format & C U Amiga an e-mail
about it as well. This would give Team Amiga more exposure :) You
could mention us if you want (but it's not necessary). Alternatively,
I could mail them, and say Team AMIGA, in conjunction with
seal.........
 Once we have the map info flowing in, and get the crayons out, we can
get to the main purpose of this, and help to organise user groups for
areas that are un-represented. 
Does anyone know of a detailed world map we can use on our miggy's ?

thanks again

 23.06.1998   PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX Announces SuperView Update and Continued Support


 In another step concerning the demonstration of planned further support of the
 "Classic Amiga" platform, including powerUP (TM), PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX today
 announced the upcoming release of SuperView NG 7.70, which will include at least
 SuperView-Library 21.3. [ Scheduled for: 30 June 1998 ]

 Every user of SuperView-Library based programs, like e.g. SuperView NG
 itself, the ArtEffect AE SuperView plugin or Picture Manager professional (PMPro)
 as well as ImageEngineer users may wish to at least upgrade the SuperView-Library
 to a newer version - the full library release is part of the freely distributable
 demo version of SViewNG, as usually.

 Registration only is required for SuperView & Tools itself - thus people who maybe
 had problems with e.g. the library shipped with the free PMPro demo from Aminet
 or with other semi or fully commercially distributed versions, may wish to install
 the new version over the old one as well.

 A number of bugs have been fixed, as well as new features have been introduced.
 For example, there now will be the long-expected Window.svdriver plus a separate
 "WinSlide" tool (the latter as part of SuperView) that finally will allow to replace
 any remaining 3rd party tools for displaying graphics in a window on public screens...

 Together with the PPC speedup modules that are available separately
 for SuperView-Library, new speed dimensions are to be encountered by
 owners of powerUP (TM) boards - the number of PPC modules already
 reached a count of (currently) 52 separate modules, including impressively
 fast ppc-native loaders/savers for e.g. JPEG, PNG and TIFF. (*)

 Here's a small overview of the programs features:

   - only requires OS V2.04 and 68000
   - utilizes OS V2.1 and V3.x features and 680x0 specific module versions,
     as well as optional powerUP (TM) powerPC module plugins (*)
   - localized and font-sensitive
   - ARexx support, AmigaGuide help and Commodity functionality
   - integrated graphics viewer, converter, editor and screen-grabber
     with basic image processing capabilities
   - many separate tools, including SuperSlide, CyberSlide, WinSlide,
     SuperViewPalette and SVPrefs

       (*) PPC modules currently based on ppc.library V45

 *****

 Includes licensed SuperView-Library, which supports the following
 file formats, periphal devices, display drivers and image processing
 operators:

     ->>>> Total of 52 different graphic file formats               <<<<-
     ->>>> Total of  2 different periphal devices                   <<<<-
