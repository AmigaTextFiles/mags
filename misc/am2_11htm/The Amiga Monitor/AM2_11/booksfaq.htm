Amiga Related Books FAQ
***********************

This FAQ is compiled as a service to the Amiga community. It is an attempt to 
give the Amiga programmer and user an overview of useful books for his/her 
favorite computer. It is not complete. If you feel that a book should be 
added to the list, want to comment on one of the books in the list, want to 
point out mistakes or add missing information, please send e-mail to: 

    <A HREF="mailto:atkin@cs.umass.edu">atkin@cs.umass.edu</A>

I think it is useful to hear people's comments about particular books. That 
is why some book descriptions are followed by quotes that I picked up from 
the Usenet Amiga news groups. If you want to have your comment removed or 
want to say something about a particular book, please contact me. Anonymous 
comments, content-free opinions, or remarks that I determine to be factually 
wrong will not be accepted.

    SAS/C, debugging techniques, AmigaDOS, the file systems, the format of 
    load and object modules, process creation, CLI and user shells, handlers 
    and packets (more than complete list of packets), and many other areas. 
    There are many useful bits and pieces about the OS that you'd have a hard 
    time finding anywhere else." 
    
    Further reviews are available in docs/misc/gurubook-info.lha on Aminet . 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines:

    Basic introduction to programming Amiga devices and resources (basic I/O 
    interface to the actual hardware). Many C examples which are available in 
    executable and source code form from Fish disk #741. Covers 
    Kickstart/Workbench through vesion 2.0. This book also contains the 
    official IFF documentation, which covers the IFF format philosophy itself 
    and many of its incarnations. The included IFF handling code has been 
    superseded several times by publications on Fish disks. As of this 
    writing, the newest version is 39.11 from Fish disk #985. 
    
  o Commodore-Amiga, Inc.: 
    The AmigaDOS Manual (3rd edition)

    $24.95, CAN 31.95, UKP 21.99 
    
    Covers all AmigaDOS through 2.04. It contains a user manual style 
    introduction to the AmigaShell and its commands (which actually is 
    identical to some user manualy shipped by C=), a printout of the 
    Autodocs, and covers the on-disk structure of OFS and FFS, the format of 
    linkable and loadable binaries, packets, and some internal DOS 
    structures. 
    
    <A HREF="mailto:arno@yaps.dinoco.de (Arno Eigenwillig)">arno@yaps.dinoco.de (Arno Eigenwillig)</A>, 27 Jul 1994: 
    "I would not recommend it, though. It has a high redundancy w.r.t. other 
    publications from C=, and its exclusive parts are often incomplete or 
    incorrect." 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga User Interface Style Guide 
    Addison-Wesley , 1991. ISBN 0-201-57757-7 
    $21.95 
    
    Describes the philosophy behinds the Amiga graphical user interface. 
    Presents guidelines for interface design ("look and feel") that all Amiga 
    applications (and games!?) should adhere to. Covers Kickstart/Workbench 
    version 2.x. Well suited for the beginner, with emphasis on general 
    interface principles, and less on the actual programming. 

1.2 Programmer's Reference 
-------------------------- 

  o John Thomas Berry: 
    Inside the Amiga with C (2nd edition) 
    Waite Group Press , 1988. ISBN 0-672-22625-1 
    $24.95 
    
    "David Sowsy" <A HREF="mailto:dsowsy@cs.uml.edu">dsowsy@cs.uml.edu</A>, 23 May 1996: 
    "It has enough theory and explains adequately the Amiga's core messaging 
    system and custom hardware accesses using C programming techniques. The 
    code however is very out of date (1.2). [The target audience is] someone 
    who has decent background in formal data structures, assembly/machine 
    level programming, and CS arithmetic (bin, hex, and decimal conversions), 
    as well as C. C++ programmers can benefit as well because the messaging 
    concepts are fairly high level." 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs 
    (3rd edition; dark gray cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1991. ISBN 0-201-56773-3 
    $38.95 
    
    Covers Kickstart/Workbench through version 2.0. The book is basically a 
    print-out of all the include (header) files and autodocs (on line 
    descriptions) of all the Amiga library functions except DOS. The reason 
    this book isn't listed with the "must have's" is that all this 
    information can be obtained in machine readable form by contacting 
    Commodore directly. Additionally, the include files come with most 
    commercial compilers. They are also included on the FreshFish CD-ROM. 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga Hardware Reference Manual 
    (3rd edition; dark gray cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1991. ISBN 0-201-56776-8 
    
    If you want to access the hardware directly, this is the book to get. 
    Descriptions of all the Amiga hardware registers. Be warned however that 
    Commodore now officially dissuades "banging the hardware". This is to 
    ensure compatability of today's programs with future releases of the 
    operating system and Amiga hardware. This book covers the Enhanced Chip 
    Set (ECS). There will be no manual for AGA (Advanced Graphic 
    Architecture).

    <A HREF="mailto:Adam@beachyhd.demon.co.uk">Adam@beachyhd.demon.co.uk</A>, 08 Apr 1996: 
    "It is out of print now, [...] but there may well be copies stored in 
    warehouses around the world if people look hard enough (I managed to pick 
    up a copy for a friend of mine about a year ago, after a bit of 
    searching). The book is basicaly split in to 3 parts. The first part 
    concerns the Amiga libraries, and gives a fairly comprehensive run down 
    (including descriptions, parameters, usage, etc.) of all the functions 
    (KS2.x) of all the main system libraries. The second part is an excellent 
    guide and reference section for programming AREXX. I learned everything I 
    know about AREXX from this book. It follows on in to details of how to 
    write external programs that can interact with AREXX programs, etc. The 
    third part is hardware related. This, nowadays, is less useful, mainly 
    because (i) we are now forbidden to touch the hardware FTMP, and (ii) 
    it's only the ECS hardware, not the AGA stuff. I still think this is one 
    of the most useful books I've bought."

    "It details quite a few low level concepts on how to write stuff for the 
    Amiga; it has some assumptions that you have come from programming a C64, 
    but it still useable otherwise. It's quite old and only goes up to 1.2, 
    and it talks about 1.1, but the basic concepts are there, which seem to 
    be lacking from more modern stuff (where it is assumed you know it 
    already). Overall, not a book I would buy new, but as it only cost me 2 
    UKP, I'm not exactly going to argue about it."

    "Came with a disk and some programs, lots of info about how the old file 
    system worked, ways to hack it, overcome copy protection etc. My gripe 
    was that 'Inside and Out' should at least cover what the jumpers do, tips 
    on fixing floppy drives, ways to make PC drives work on the Amiga etc. If 
    I had a chance to glance at it first, I would not have ordered it, but it 
    was mail order. I'm sure some coders would like the book, but ah well, 
    it's too dated now, I think."

    physically stored on the disks to everything a programmer should know 
    about: programming under AmigaDos or directly `banging' on the hardware. 
    It includes plenty of examples (and there are 3 working programs at the 
    end of the book) and a disassembly of the ROM routines. Don't even think 
    about making your own boot disk without this book! If you can find it

    [...] includes a complete list of the registers of the AGA-Custom-Chips. 
    As far as I know, this guide is the only available documentation about 
    AGA. It's pretty useful for demo/game coders who already know how the OCS 
    works, because the guide doesn't give any real examples (except 
    explaining how the new display and sprite modes work). The registers are 
    both listed by address and by name. If you click on the register's name 
    you get exact information about what each bit means and how it has to be 
    used. All in all I'd say that this guide is pretty useful." 

1.6 Important Older Material 
---------------------------- 

  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries and Devices 
    (1st edition; white cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1986. ISBN 0-201-11078-4 
    
    Covers the Amiga System Software up to Version 1.2. Gives a good 
    introduction to programming Amiga graphics and I/O. Many examples, mostly 
    in C (Source Code can be found on Fisk Disk ???). Since the operating 
    system has evolved quite a bit since 1986, this and the following books' 
    value is now mostly nostalgia... 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga Intuition Reference Manual 
    (1st edition; white cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1986. ISBN 0-201-11076-8 
    
    Covers Intuition programming through Workbench 1.2. A wonderfully gentle 
    introduction to programming user interfaces on the Amiga. Contains a lot 
    of information on the philosophy of the Amiga interface. Basic knowledge 
    of C required. Now superseded by the newer "RKM: Libraries" and "User 
    Interface Style Guide". 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Exec 
    (1st edition; white cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1986. ISBN 0-201-11099-7 
    
    Covers Exec programming through Kickstart/Workbench 1.2. The nitty gritty 
    of the Amiga kernel: Basic data structures, tasks, memory allocation and 
    the like. Now superseded by the newer "RKM: Libraries". 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga Hardware Reference Manual 
    (1st edition; white cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1986. ISBN 0-201-11077-6 
    
    The hardware bangers manual for the original chipset (OCS). Explains what 
    all the hardware registers mean and how to get them to work for you. Some 
    assembly examples. Since Commodore now officially dissuades from directly 
    accessing the hardware, and has no plans for publishing an AGA hardware 
    manual, this book is actually still fairly useful for those who have to 
    know how their computer works on the hardware level. 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs 
    (2nd edition; blue cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1989. ISBN 0-201-18177-0 
    
    Covers version Kickstart/Workbench Version 1.3. A print-out of all the 
    include files and autodocs (on-line documentation) for all the Amiga 
    library functions (except DOS). Contains summaries and call parameters 
    for all the functions. This information had previously been distributed 
    amongst the Libraries, Exec, and Intuition Rom Kernel Reference Manual in 
    the 1.2 release. 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries and Devices 
    (2nd edition; blue cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1989. ISBN 0-201-18187-8 
    
    All the introductory text and examples from the Kickstart Version 1.2 ROM 
    Kernel Reference Manuals, revised and updated for Version 1.3. All 
    examples are available in executable and source code form from Fish disk 
    #344. 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga Hardware Reference Manual 
    (2nd edition; blue cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1989. ISBN 0-201-18157-6 
    
    As far as I know, this manual is basically identical to the 1.2 release 
    described above (although it claims to be updated to release 1.3). 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    AmigaDOS V2.0 Native Developer Update 
    Commodore, [year?]. 
    CATS part number: NATDEV20 
    $20.00 
    
    The 2.0 Native Developer Update is a must-have for any Amiga programmer. 
    This four-disk set contains the final 2.0 function Autodocs, final 2.0 C 
    and assembler Amiga include files, linker libs (Amiga.lib, debug.lib, 
    ddebug.lib) FD files, offsets, a great deal of 2.0 example code, and the 
    "Software Toolkit II" disk full of the latest Amiga debugging tools. 
    (This disk set has been replaced by the new V3.1 Amiga Developer Update 
    but is still very useful for its 2.0 example code).

    guess what I dont like it. It is so old that it was written for Workbench 
    1.2, it teaches you bad coding habits and the code in there never seemed 
    to work for me. ;-( I had the misfortune to try and learn assembly from 
    this book when it first came out. I've still got it but now it's in lots 
    of small pieces, it's great therapy tearing yet another page to bits when 
    some code doesn't do what it should. ;-) Try `Mastering Amiga Assembler' 
    by Paul Overaa published by Bruce Smith Books. Also try a generic 68000 
    programming book to learn the instruction set and register usage."

    "I much prefer [this book] [over Kernighan and Ritchie's `The C 
    Programming Language']. It includes not only information on `traditional' 
    (pre-ANSI) implementations, but discusses portability and related issues. 
    The latest edition even discusses compatibility with C++. It *is* a 
    reference manual, though. (They did add exercises in the 3rd edition). 
    K&R's book, on the other hand, is a textbook. If you are just starting 
    out (especially if you don't have a lot of experience programming in 
    similar languages, such as Pascal), [K&R's book] will probably be a 
    better choice to *learn* the language. It is not as good as a reference.

    The complete boiled-down C manual for the Amiga which describes how to 
    open and work with Screens, Windows, Graphics, Gadgets, Requesters, 
    Alerts, Menus, IDCMP, Sprites, VSprites, AmigaDOS, Low Level Graphics 
    Routines, Hints and Tips, etc. The manual also explains how to use your C 
    Compiler and gives you important information about how the Amiga works 
    and how your programs should be designed. The manual consists of 15 
    chapters together with more than 100 fully executable examples with 
    source code.

    Optional Companion Disk: ISBN 0-9632773-1-6 
    
    A very good introduction to ARexx. The book uses examples to introduce 
    the features of this programing language. The examples are often very 
    useful themselves. This book is not a reference manual, but a tutorial. I 
    would say it is very well suited for beginners but also for more advanced 
    programmers.

    (Written in German) 
    
    This book is divided into three the parts: the first covers the basics of 
    ARexx (variables, operators, the instructions, etc., organized both 
    alphabetically and by topic) and the ARexx environment. The second covers 
    three common ARexx function libraries (RexxArpLib, APIG, and 
    RexxSerDev.library), the third "hosts": the RexxPlus compiler, ExecRexx, 
    writing ARexx scripts for application programs. A disk with all examples 
    and libraries may be purchased separately for an additional DM 10.

    This is a complete ARexx reference guide in AmigaGuide format. It is 
    available from Aminet ( util/rexx/ARexxGuide2_0A.lha ). 
    
    From the "readme file": 
    ARexxGuide is a complete ARexx reference with tutorials and dozens of 
    ready-to-use examples. Done in AmigaGuide format, it includes argument 
    templates and descriptions of all instruction keywords, of built-in 
    functions, and of the functions in rexxsupport.library. The basic 
    elements of the language are fully explained. Example programs -- some of 
    them interactive -- answer frequently-asked questions about the language. 
    Sample clauses are included with each function and instruction 
    explanation. Error codes and possible solutions are explained. 
    A help-system that will turn nearly any text editor into an online 
    reference to ARexx is included. Working macros for three editors are 
    provided as examples. A step-by-step tutorial explains the simple steps 
    for making a new macro for a different editor.

    other material and an overview of individual areas. But at over 1000 
    pages, it's a must have if you do graphics. If you can afford only ONE 
    book on graphics, get this one."

    little tricks and tips for a lot of little things, but personally I 
    haven't found much use for them, but I'm looking only at the interactive 
    3d side of things. Every now and then a friend tells me 'Wow, this one 
    little paragraph in Gems [X] gave me a huge insight into what I needed to 
    do and now my [program] is MUCH faster'. So to be fair, a lot of others 
    have found these books to be invaluable. They cover a bit too much ground 
    for me, so I'm still kind of hesitant on recommending them to others 
    since it's not readily apparent if they will be helpful to you. Your 
    mileage may vary."

    "It's very complete and it comes with source code written in C++ for the 
    IBM PC. I didn't have much trouble converting it to SAS/C. You do have to 
    transfer files from the IBM disk to an amiga disk, though. The book comes 
    with the disk. The book is really GREAT because it's very thorough and 
    easy to understand. It teaches you from the ground up. One thing though, 
    is that the source code had a number of minor bugs which I had to fix. 
    Also, I optimized some of the code to make it faster. For one thing, I 
    replaced the 4x4 matrices with 3x3 ones. [...] It's so easy to

    running with the simple concepts that more advanced text books don't

    "Excellent book on curves, patches, and a lot of math. Does not cover 
    rendering at all -- no shading, etc. It does a lot of theory on 
    projections, however -- don't expect much on object databases or 
    efficiency, though. Not a great reference to a 3d renderer, but for 
    modeling in general and math it's wonderful. HOWEVER, it has an insane 
    amount of stuff on curves, splines, Bezier curves, Coons patches, 
    surfaces, etc. So if you want to do surfaces and things with soft edges 
    in general, get this book. One of the few McGraw-Hill books I've liked

    Most of it covers rendering and ray tracing, which means it is not very 
    useful for real-time graphics [...] the stuff it covers is invaluable and 
    very difficult to find elsewhere. We are talking heavy rendering and ray 
    tracing stuff, volume rendering techniques, shading languages, 
    quaternions and Euler angles, radiosity, inverse/forward kinematics, etc. 
    Excellent book, but not very useful if you are looking to write only a

    for robots/tanks)."

    did. It also uses obscure algorithms for the simplest of calculations. 
    Get the HowToCode package [from Aminet]. It has a much better explanation 
    of 3d vectors and stuff. The book is punted as an easy way to learn 
    assembly while learning 3d graphics. Not true. If you have had no 
    experience with assembly before, then you've got little chance of 
    learning it from this book. The book is divided into sections for each

    "Although Making the Most of Midi explains the fundamentals of Midi and

    issues that will be of help to more established users. [...] Paul has 
    produced a book which looks at various Midi technical issues but explains 
    them in terms that all Midi users will be able to understand. He has also 
    examined some of the more complex issues, including details about fault 
    finding and how Midi oriented computer programs are written."
