<HR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Although most products we review are those that we have purchased or otherwise obtained for our own purposes, we sometimes review products at the request of the companies or individuals producing or developing them. If you have something you would like us to review at The Amiga Monitor, please contact us about doing so.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you would like to contact the member of the staff most appropriate to the nature of your product directly, see the <A HREF="staff.htm">Staff List</A>. Otherwise, you can e-mail us at <A HREF="mailto:kylewebb@aol.com (AM Product Reviews)">kylewebb@aol.com</A> (please check the <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html">AM Link Redirection Page</A> for an up-to-date e-mail address first if possible, but otherwise use this address).</P>
