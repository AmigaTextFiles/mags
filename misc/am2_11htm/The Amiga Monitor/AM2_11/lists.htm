<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can have The Amiga Monitor delivered to you via e-mail, or you can be notified when a new issue is available. There are currently four lists; send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:mikewebb@csi.com">mikewebb@csi.com</A> (please check the <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html">AM Link Redirection Page</A> for an up-to-date e-mail address first if possible, but otherwise use this address) in which you specify the list(s) you would like to join (or leave):</P>

HTML-format files archived with LhA

<BR>
HTML-format files archived with ZIP
<LI>
<B>AmigaGuide LhA</B>
<BR>
AmigaGuide-format files archived with LhA (as of this writing, there is a very significant backlog of issues needing to be converted from HTML to AmigaGuide, and new issues have not been available in AmigaGuide for some time; however, this is a high-priority problem and will be addressed as soon as time and resources permit)
<LI>
<B>New issue notification of availability</B>
<BR>
Via this list, we send out a simple, small notification that a new issue has been made available in any format. It allows readers to stay up-to-date with AM without having to download entire archives as e-mail attachments.
</UL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If we successfully receive and process your request, you will receive notification that you have been added to a list. If you do not receive a response within two weeks, please check to see that your correct e-mail address is included with the message, and resend your request.</P>

<LI>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our Publisher sends the AM archives out through his mailbox enough times each month without it coming in several times as well. Please make his life a little easier, and do your best to prevent bouncebacks:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Please notify us if your e-mail address changes.
<LI>Also, please be certain that your provider can handle fairly large attached files. The AM archives generally range in size from 50 kB to 500 kB. We can tolerate it if you have problems with some of the larger ones, but if there are consistent problems with smaller archives, we will have to move you to the Notification List.
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Depending on the error message specified in the bounced-back message, we may automatically remove an address from a list upon receiving a bounceback.</P>
