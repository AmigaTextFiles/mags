<P ALIGN="LEFT">Announcing a new Web Site for the Benefit of The Amiga Community.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga Yellow Pages.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Launched Sunday 7 June 1998.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga Yellow Pages is like any other Yellow Pages -- but dedicated to the Amiga only.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Everything appears as a classified listing From Amiga International (A) through (b) books (Amiga), Games developers, Hardware Developers, Internet Service Providers, etc., etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The big difference, unlike other web classified pages, is that small companies without their own Internet web site can have a large classified display link.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">(AYP is non profit making).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For example, one of the companies featured Fore-Matt home computing (a small company hoping to breakthrough in the Amiga scene) have a large display box which includes their phone number.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It is really these type of small business that AYP was setup for.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">However any one can have a link as long as they are Amiga related. From large companies i.e. phase 5 through to Bedroom programmers, user groups, etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">See for yourself at:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">AYP is also looking for Shops around the World which stock Amiga Products. If you know of any such retailers please e-mail me at:</P>
