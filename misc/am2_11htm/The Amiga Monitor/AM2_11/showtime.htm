<P ALIGN="LEFT"><BLOCKQUOTE>"Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends..."</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hi, folks, and welcome back to SHOWTIME!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In this month's issue of <I>The Amiga Monitor</I>, developments are fast and furious in the upcoming AmiWest 98 show (<A HREF="http://www.sacc.org/amiwest/">http://www.sacc.org/amiwest/</A>), being held at the Ramada Inn in Sacramento, California, July 11 and 12, 1998). There are rather lengthy expositions being posted in Team Amiga's News Channel, and it was decided their needs are better met by publishing those postings in "<A HREF="press.htm">Press Releases</A>" this month. There you will find the most current developments that I have received regarding this ever-expanding, and likely highly successful show. "Everybody who's anybody" is going to be there :)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Something I should have made a point of before in previous installments of SHOWTIME! : It is likely that what you read here is outdated, due to time lapse between the submission of the article and the time <I>The Amiga Monitor</I> is published. I strongly suggest for up-to-the-minute listings of exhibitors and any format changes, you consult the show's website, always provided here in the article.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Back to AmiWest: Here's their nifty banner / link, for those of you who missed SHOWTIME!, or want to have an in-depth look around the AmiWest site.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><BLOCKQUOTE>"Many people recall the days when it was fun to just play around on the old computer....the days when you had programs that would fit on a disk or two (not need a CD-ROM or two!), or...even be able to have several programs on a single disk. Some of you may never have experienced this, but may have heard of it from people who got their computing start on Timex-Sinclairs, Atari computers (they made these before they did game machines), TI-99's, C64's, Spectrums, etc. It is still possible to have this kind of fun, and still own a useful home or small business computer. You can actually find machines out in the real world that you can easily understand without having to take a degree in computer science or spend a large chunk of your yearly income to afford. You are probably saying "is this guy for real?" or "what is the catch?" No catch and it is for real! COMPUTING CAN BE FUN!!!! The SINCLAIR QL (32-bit) and the Cambridge Z88 palmtop! Also the Amiga (now owned by Gateway 2000). These machines are still available for those who want to have fun. You can even still keep your IBM compatible or Mac (not a bad, yet an expensive, computer) around for those uses they are best suited for. Read on if you want to know more. Make just one more part of life go at your speed! Come on, no more IRQ silliness! Eh? Follow the FWD Computing links to find out how to obtain, care for, and expand on one of these classic, yet still useable and fun, computers. By the way, Amigas are still being improved on and produced. QL's and Z88's are still being upgraded. They are not dead machines. You can even get professional-level emulators for Amigas, QL's, and Z88's that will run on your PC. Ask us in an e-mail about them."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"What is the Siamese System all about and how can it help you?</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Firstly the Siamese System is a philosophy backed up by the most innovative software that can be developed, both by our own efforts and in conjunction with some of the great programmers in this diverse computing market place.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"It started three years ago because my company had so many problems needing to run software that ran on three different computing platforms for multimedia development. Then I had the problems of getting the data together in one place for output to CD-ROM, and which machine should I use. Networking solved some of the problems but not the overall problem of something as simple as, why have three expensive monitors, which keyboard should I be using at present and where did I put the Mac Mouse?</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Finally it occurred to me that what I needed was to pull together some talent to help me improve my software and hardware that would join all of my systems together to create one Many Operating System computer, or as I like to call it the MultiOS-PC. We are now at the final hurdle to creating the Ultimate System for the majority of users, one that can run Windows, Macintosh and Amiga (yes, Amiga) software from within ONE box, with ONE monitor and ONE Keyboard and Mouse.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"No more trying to get data from the PC to the Mac via floppy disk or messing around with networking cards or parallel networking solutions. ALL resources are shared between the three platforms, i.e., all three OS's using the same Graphics card, Sound Card, modem etc. is an added extra bonus.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"For schools that have a lot of 68k-based Macintoshes this is the ideal way for them to migrate to the Windows environment without giving up their Macintosh software. Also the fact that there will be a large base of educational software that is simply unavailable on the PC, but with the world moving that way the schools must keep up.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Many people recall the days when it was fun to just play around on the old computer....the days when you had programs that would fit on a disk or two (not need a CD-ROM or two!), or...even be able to have several programs on a single disk. Some of you may never have experienced this, but may have heard of it from people who got their computing start on Timex-Sinclairs, Atari computers (they made these before they did game machines), TI-99's, C64's, Spectrums, etc. It is still possible to have this kind of fun, and still own a useful home or small business computer. You can actually find machines out in the real world that you can easily understand without having to take a degree in computer science or spend a large chunk of your yearly income to afford. You are probably saying "is this guy for real?" or "what is the catch?" No catch and it is for real! COMPUTING CAN BE FUN!!!! The SINCLAIR QL (32-bit) and the Cambridge Z88 palmtop! Also the Amiga (now owned by Gateway 2000). These machines are still available for those who want to have fun. You can even still keep your IBM compatible or Mac (not a bad, yet an expensive, computer) around for those uses they are best suited for. Read on if you want to know more. Make just one more part of life go at your speed! Come on, no more IRQ silliness! Eh? Follow the FWD Computing links to find out how to obtain, care for, and expand on one of these classic, yet still useable and fun, computers. By the way, Amigas are still being improved on and produced. QL's and Z88's are still being upgraded. They are not dead machines. You can even get professional-level emulators for Amigas, QL's, and Z88's that will run on your PC. Ask us in an e-mail about them."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We are relatively new (just got active last year in vending at all Amiga computer Shows, first at Amicon at Columbus, Ohio and then The Amiga Gateway Show at St. Louis) but have had good response from customers. We had been selling new Amiga software at general computer shows before that for 3 years. We have been doing mail order and computer shows since 19986 [sic], but for British computers like the QL and Cambridge Z88.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our goal now is to provide superb mail order service and prices on Amiga CD-ROM software and to attend and sell at as many Amiga-oriented shows as possible. We would like to have been at the show in Toronto.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">We currently attend approximately 20 general computer shows a year and 3-4 all [very sic] Amiga shows. Best time to get us by fax, e-mail is anytime, and by phone Tuesday thru Thursday (often gone to shows Friday thru Monday) with an answering machine for the other times. Thanks and let's all support the Amiga!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">And, a press release update, received in my office 6-18-98:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Press Release: Update - The 1998 Midwest Amiga Exposition.<BR>
October 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.<BR>
From: The Amiga Central Ohio Network, David Pearce and Ronn Black - MAE Coordinators.<BR>
Date: June 17th, 1998.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Amiga Central Ohio Network is pleased to announce the recent update to the exhibitor listings for the Midwest Amiga Exposition along with the new face-lift our web site has recently received.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our show this year is taking place at the Hyatt Regency Columbus, which offers us almost 7,000 square feet of exhibitor space, making this show THE largest show in North America this year and doubling our show from last year! The Hyatt Regency is a perfect location for our event and features dozens of downstairs restaurants and shops as well as being close by many activities, restaurants, and micro breweries of downtown Columbus. We are also proud to announce that IRC, Web Cam, and WWW access will be available from the show floor this year. We will be setting up dedicated lines for each of these allowing for total participation from the Amiga community from around the world with no interruptions!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can check out who is going to be present at our show by visiting <A HREF="http://www.amicon.org/mae.html">http://www.amicon.org/mae.html</A> and following the "Who will be there" link. Right now, we've only listed a few companies and user groups who have committed at this time. Many more will be appearing soon as the show dates draw closer, so please watch for updates in the coming weeks.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At this time the seminars are being lined up with the gracious help of the ICOA (<A HREF="http://www.amiganet.org/icoa/">http://www.amiganet.org/icoa/</A>) who have done an outstanding job of coordination and scheduling past seminars at other major Amiga events around the world. Our seminars page will be updated soon with a list of times, costs, and descriptions of the seminars that will be offered.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Vendors are encouraged to sign up soon and get your requests for prime floor space in early. All vendors will receive detailed instructions and floor specs as the show dates draw closer. Pipe and drape is available for that "professional" look as well as dedicated phone lines. Please visit <A HREF="http://www.amicon.org/mae.html">http://www.amicon.org/mae.html</A> and follow the "Exhibitor Information" link to find out prices, selections and other details.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For room reservations, please contact the HYATT REGENCY COLUMBUS at (800) 233-1234 or (614) 463-1234 and tell them you will be attending the Midwest Amiga Exposition on October 2nd, 3rd, and 4th to receive a special show attendee discount. Also, please make sure you call the Hyatt Regency Columbus and not the Hyatt of downtown Columbus. These are two different places and we're not big enough to occupy both at the same time (yet!).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Tickets are $12.00 for two days and $8.00 for one day, available at the door of the show. Some seminars may be extra.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Grand prizes, games, new products, official press statements, educational seminars, great people, great deals, and everything great about the Amiga will be at the Midwest Amiga Exposition! So shouldn't you be?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Visit our web pages at <A HREF="http://www.amicon.org/">http://www.amicon.org/</A>, check out the show details, send us mail about our typos ;) and if you don't see your favorite Amiga vendor on the list, e-mail us and we'll make sure they know you want to see them at the 1998 Midwest Amiga Exposition!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you have any questions about attending the show or seminars, or about exhibiting for our show, please e-mail David Pearce, <A HREF="mailto:dpearce@amicon.org">dpearce@amicon.org</A> or Ronn Black, <A HREF="rblack@amicon.org">rblack@amicon.org</A>. A phone number will be available shortly to take inquiries.</P>
