                          MiggyByte ReadMe file
                          =====================

This text file is for Floppy Users, if you wish to run MiggyByte from a hard
drive then read the INSTALL_TO_HD file.

If this file was not recived in a .DMS archive then you have NOT recived
the official release version but don't panic some BBS don't allow DMS files
and AmiNet also frowns on them. So here is what you must do to get the
program to run.

Format a blank DSDD disk and name it MB then install it.
Next unarc/copy all the files in the original archive on to the newly
prepaired floppy.

...and thats it. Re-Boot and enjoy :)
