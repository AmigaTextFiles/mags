              Competition PRO - Super CD-32 Control Pad

                   Price: £19.99 (from Game Ltd.)

Well  incase you haven't noticed the controller that comes with the CD-32
is  erm  well  shit.   Sorry  to say it but it is and thats a fact.  This
beauty  is  a  replacement  controller  for  the  CD-32 and for the Amiga
computers.   So  now all you lovely people out there can play those CD-32
titles  on your Amiga with CD-Roms, with a fully fledged CD-32 compatible
controller.

SO  whats  it  like  I here you all scream.  Well its grey, bit of a sick
colour I know but I think its like that to blend in with the CD-32 colour
scheme.   It has the standard 6 fire buttons and the 8-way controller and
the pause and continue switches.  It also has an autofire switch for each
of the main 4 fire buttons but curiously not for the finger mounted ?

CD-32  owners  might  like  to  note that the are clearly marked with the
Audio  CD  controllers  so  it has never been easier to play audio CDs in
your CD-32. [CLICK FIG BUTTON]

Its  well  built  and looks like it will last and last.  Well thats about
all so I'm off to play another game of Gloom!

So  if  you  need a CD-32 type controller then this is a must even if you
don't have a CD-32 but just an Amiga loads of games now support the extra
buttons so get one today well worth the money.
