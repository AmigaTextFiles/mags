I  was  going  to  review  this value for money modem from Escom which is
going  for just under £80.  But when I went to purchase one from my local
branch they did not have one.

However  I don't give up that easy so I phoned up another branch, only to
hear  that  they  did not have one either.  Ok fair enough I suppose it's
possible, so I phoned another Escom, again no modems sorry.  By this time
I'm  getting  pretty annoyed, I tried one more but the same story nope we
have  not  got  any  in  stock.  I thought I would ask them if they could
order  one for me.  I was amassed when they said they could not order one
as they can't order that sort of thing.  I asked if they had any ideas on
when  they  could  get  one,  well I may as well have been talking to the
cleaner for as much help I got there.

So  here  I  am  still without the modem, so is this just a trick to make
them  look good by only releasing a few?  The best excuse I received come
from  my  local  branch.  They said "People want to get onto the Internet
with  Windows  '95".   I mean could they not do this before?  are pc's as
rubbish as well all thought?

So this is a message to any pc readers STOP NICKING ALL THE BLODDY MODEMS
coz there are serious computer people out there that want them!

maybe if anyone managed to buy a modem they can send us a review in so we
can find out if they are indeed value for money.
