Don't  you  just  dread  that envelope coming through your door 4 times a
year,  telling you to pay up a few hundred pounds just because you wanted
to talk to someone over the phone?

Well  here  is a cheap way to talk to someone why not just get yourself a
CB  radio,  chances are you can buy one and the license fee for the price
of  one  quarters  bill.  Now you can chat for as much as you want for as
long  as you want without paying for the privilege of doing so except for
the nominal license fee once a year.

OK  the  quality  is  not as good and you may not fins a free channel but
what do you want for free?

The  other night I was told of a plan by cable to let its users have free
chat  if BT were go bankrupt or leave the market.  It could not do it now
under  fair  trading  laws so maybe there is a hint in there, maybe if we
ALL  changed over to cable then we could get rid of BT and get FREE calls
all the time now is it just me or does that sound VERY good?
