Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier

Katie Hafner & John Markoff

Published by Corgi         ISBN 0-522-13963-7

OK  from  the  title  of this book its pretty obvious what its all about.
Computer  crime,  hacking,  piracy  and virus.  The book focuses on three
main stories, which are all true.

1. Kevin: The Dark-Side Hacker

Kevin  was  a  normal  sort of kid (weren't we all) who had a fascination
with  computers,  in  short  Kevin  is/was the typical hacker stereotype.
What  he did was to hack into one of the top US's leading business.  This
soon attracted the attentions of the authorities and the FBI.

2. Pengo and Project Equalizer

Pengo  was  a  young  Berliner  who dreamed of becoming one of the worlds
greatest  hackers.  This ambition of his led him to trade stolen computer
data with the Soviet Union.

3. RTM

Robert  Morris  a  very talented programmer who brought down a nationwide
computer  network and rased the worlds eye brow to the danger of computer
virus.   This  account follows Morris through the programming and letting
lose  of  the  Worm (type of virus) and the following court case.  Yes he
was caught and punished.

This  book makes a gripping read for all those interested in the computer
underworld.   It  was  first  published  in  1991  but most of the tricks
described  are  still in use today.  Well if you don't believe me this is
what  Bruce Sterling (author of The Hacker Crackdown) said 'The best book
ever written on the computer underground'.
