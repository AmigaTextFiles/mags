Madness
=======

Welcome  to  issue two of MiggyByte the only disk based mag worth reading
on any computer platform ;-)

This  issue  has  some stunning info on the state of the Amiga in the UK,
and the US users thought they had it bad.  Well at least over there I bet
some shop staff know what an Amiga is?  Hmm probably got you confused now
well  read  Sigma's  and Defactos little phone survey of the London ESCOM
shops, and believe me you will be shocked.

Sigma's bit
-----------
Well  here  we  are again back in the new improved 2 for the price of one
MiGGYBYTE  Issue  2,  8  out  of  10 Amiga owners prefer it!  So what has
happened  in  the  Amiga World Since the last issue?  Well the creator of
Directory  Opus  has  said over the internet that he will be making a few
more upgrades to Opus's for the Amiga and that he might be coding for the
P*.   Read  my  piece  on  piracy on the Amiga, including infiltration to
several Pirate bbs's in Liverpool.

By  the time you read this I will be tucking into my new Modem from Escom
now  is  that  cheap  or what, for you peeps out there that have not seen
these prices well here they are :

External 14.4k  £ 69.33
External   28k  £139.83

So  why  not  go  out  and  buy one today as they are excellent value for
money.


Defacto`s Bit

Yeah  people issue 2 is here, hopefully slightly improved and better!  ;)
the  amiga  situation  is  as weird as ever with the employees at Escom`s
retail   outlets   not  having  a  clue  about  the  machine  and  giving
mis/dis-information about it, this could be potentially dangerous at this
time  when  the  machine  needs  buyers in order for it to survive and be
re-born again.  Only time will tell.  Anyway ram chips are going cheap at
Escom shops and disks are still a steal so stock up your supplies!.

Adios for now.
