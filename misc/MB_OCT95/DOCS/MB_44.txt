I  managed to come across this 'text file' and I thought I would share it
with the world.  So here goes and um I don't know if you really even want
to try this due to the mentioning of TOXIC!


Find a herbal shop and your finest kitchen scales.

Take :
      Coriander Oil           (A trace)
      Orange Blossom Oil      (A trace)
      Orange Oil              (0.94g)
      Lemon Oil               (1.79g)
      Nutmeg Oil              (0.14g)
      Cinnamon Oil            (0.41g)

** Warning, these oils can be toxic! **

Mix them in alcohol (9.97g) and water (5.5g).

Shake well and allow to stand for 24 hours.  The mixture will separate.

At  the  top  is  a  clear  yellow  liquid  :   This  is  the secret "7X"
flavouring.


Next, dissolve 4.88g of sugar in smallest amount of boiling water.  Allow
to cool.

Add :
      Caramel                 (73g)
      Caffeine                (6.3g)
      Phosphoric Acid         (22.4g)

Purists  may include 2.24g of Coco leaf (first remove the cocaine!) and a
sprinkling of powdered nut from the Kola tree.

You now have a thick syrup.
Add :
      Lime Juice              (61g)
      Glycerin                (38.7g)
      Vanilla Extract         (3.05g)


Add  the  "7X", stir hard and dilute with 5.5 parts of chilled carbonated
water.   There  is  enough  to  make  50  litres  of  Cola.  Send for the
kiddies...

End
