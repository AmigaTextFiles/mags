This small demo was uploaded for review so here goes....

This  small  demo was written using AMOS Pro.  In the demo there are four
'rainbow'  bars  flickering  in  the background in time to the music.  In
front  of that is an animated background, on top of that is 64 x 64 pixel
ball  slowly  bouncing  around  the  screen  and  in a lower portion is a
horizontal text scroller.

I  can't  really describe the music but its kind of a bouncy yet relaxing
in places music.  Its quite good, if a little simple.

In  the  demo,  you have the background being animated, this changes with
different  things  being animated, first its balls, the rotating overhead
pyramids  and  the  a  strange  pattern  (the  best effect).  Sometimes a
picture fades in over these animated patterns, while you get the standard
greets and stuff coming from the scroll text.

Its  an  okay  demo,  the only problem being that every so often there is
this  momentary slow down (I'm using an A1200 BTW) so it isn't completely
smooth.  Also the scroller seems a little jerky.

This  demo  shows that you can do some alright stuff with AMOS if you try
but it doesn't match many other mini demos.

Overall rating.................................................74%

Not bad, shows some potential.
