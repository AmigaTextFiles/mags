                           ==============

Wow!   Just  got this through the post and here`s a quick review...  none
of  the  bollocks you`ll read in Amiga Action etc.  cos I`ve been playing
this solid for the past three evenings ;-)

The  plot...   hmmm, dunno, I don`t bother reading the blurb - won`t make
the  game  any  better but basically you guide a robot called Dave (small
plug  for  the  Perception  BBS  me thinks :) around various game worlds.
Sorta  reminiscent  of  the  West World film, these areas are infested by
viruses  and have set all the cute racing cars and funny creatures on the
rampage.  Guide Dave about killing the viruses and game world inhabitants
and save the universe etc.

Doh,  why  didn`t  I  think of such an original plot!  Ignoring the usual
naff plot the game IS quite fun.  The display is of Dave at the centre of
the screen in a 3D'ish land.  No fancy graphics just fast 8 way scrolling
and  the  same slick look that attracts suckers to Sega and Nintendo.  In
fact this seems - sadly - out place on the humble Amiga.

So  what`s  special  about  the  game?  Hmm, well the game starts getting
tricky  right  after  the  first  level:   attack patterns and styles get
progressively  more  deadly.  Luckily there are two points in your favour
when  playing.   Firstly  there is a password feature in the game to skip
levels but best feature is the weapons...

Most  creatures  that are killed leave behind an energy sphere which Dave
can  pick-up.   At the beginning of the next level you can use the energy
to  charge up some deadly weapons.  Dave can only hold three at a time so
you get to pick from your collection.  In combat you can swop between the
three  but  some  have  only  limited power and are quickly used up.  The
basic  machine  gun  is  great to look at, spraying blank shell cases all
over  the  place,  but  various rockets, lasers, mines and flame-throwers
make short work of the attacking creatures once you get the hang of them.

To round up, great shoot-em-up but you need to be dedicated as the levels
soon get very difficult after the first game world.

Tech Info
=========

 * A500 version with extras for the A1200 or proper A1200 version
 * Cost me 20 quid mail-order
 * Hard drive installable
 * Uses "enter word from manual..." protection (bit irritating)
 * Needs 1 meg of memory (2 meg on the A1200, natch)
 * Comes on 3 disks
 * One or two player + Team Play option
 * Supports joystick (1 or 2 button), keyboard
 * Can use mouse control on A1200 version (who`s bright ideas woz this)

Quick Hints
===========

If  you`re  installing  to  hard drive unless you have an extra 2 megs of
memory  it  won`t  run  from Workbench.  Examine the AmigaDOS scripts the
game  installs  and write your own version.  Kill the Startup-Sequence on
boot up then run your script to get the game running.

The  manual  doesn`t  describe the weapons too well.  Try a few games and
buy  different  weapons  to see how they work.  Once you`ve found one you
like (hopefully one you can get after a few levels) stick with it.

Next Reviews
============

I`ve also got Frontier 2:  First Encounter and Exile 1200 on order.  Once
these are released I`ll type a few words on these.


Cheerio m8y-peeps!
