                         ====================

                  by Joshua Quittner & Michelle Slatalla

               Published by Vintage         ISBN 0-09-957681-3

This  book  does  not  rattle  on about the computer under world and many
different hero's and villains it contains.  It concentrates on one of the
most notorious hacker groups ever in the US.  A group know by the acronym
MOD, Masters of Deception.

The  MOD  were  one  of the first hacker groups to become front page news
when  they were attributed to the infamous crash of the telephone network
in  the US.  The book charts the birth of the MOD, its short life and its
sudden death.

But don't be put of by the lack of variety in this book as its a gripping
read  and  contains  some  new  and unpublished information that even the
great Bruce Sterling missed for his book 'The Hacker Crackdown'.
