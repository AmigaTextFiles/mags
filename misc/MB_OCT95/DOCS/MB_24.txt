                         -+- By Mark Klocek -+-

This  disk  mag  was released on the 5th of September from the NFA group.
This 2 disk, disk mag is pretty cool.

The  first  thing  is that the front end was programmed using AMOS and it
looks  very  professional,  actually  it  is better than the interface on
Miggy  Byte  issue 1, but then again they've had seven issues to practise
on.

There  are  absolutely  loads  of  articles  ranging  from  scene  stuff,
commercial  games  including  everything there is to know about Gloom, PD
stuff,  loads of this'n'that stuff and the password protected adult area.
(I know the password so ner, ner, ner.  Its a great riddle!)

The  articles are all pretty well thought out and there is a wide variety
of them.  I liked this disk mag a lot.  Its well worth a read but the two
archived  DMS  files  come to a total of about 1meg and 600k so if you've
got  a slow modem it will take a while to download.  16 minutes for those
at 14400 and 8 minutes for those at 28800.

So the final score is..............................................89%

A good read with variety and a nice looking interface. Well done NFA.
