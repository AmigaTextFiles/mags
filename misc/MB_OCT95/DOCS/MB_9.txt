                    Virtual Reality for the Amiga
                    =============================

Virtual  i-O  a  sister  company of Amiga Technologies has announced that
their  Virtual Reality glasses are soon to be shipping.  The glasses come
in  two flavours, one for the PC and Mac which contains a motion detector
and a VGA to composite converter and is expected to retail at £899!.  The
other  flavour  is  for  the  Amiga,  Saturn,  Jag etc and is basically a
striped down version as there is no need for the converter, but they have
also  left  out  the  motion  detector!   This  means the glasses are not
Virtual Reality but just a very expensive 3D add on, one good thing being
the price £599.

There  is  due  to be a full Amiga compatible version of the glasses that
support motion detection, and even better they will cost less than the PC
version.   This  is due to the fact that the Amiga doesn't need composite
converter.
