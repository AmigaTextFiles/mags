                        MiggyByte Editors


If  your  name  is  Mary Whitehouse or you are easily offended by obscene
remarks  such  as  `Your  Mum`  then  go and do something else like watch
gardeners  world or write to points of view!!.  This magazine is aimed at
a  broad minded audience which covers a wide range of subjects including,
subjects  of  sexual  matters and conspiracy theories, jokes and why PC's
are  crap!.   This  magazine  is  aimed at 16+ age group, so no crap from
parents  saying,  "My  son  learnt  how  to  make a Atomic Bomb from used
lottery   tickets!".   Also  a  message  to  MP`S  and  the  media  about
controversial articles such as making bombs these can be obtained in your
local  library,  in  any  well  known encyclopedia, so no bullshit please
unless  you  wanna  get  flamed!!.   If any articles are considered to be
under  any  official  censorship  law that WE know about they will not be
included.   Unfortunately  we  cannot  trace any authors down due to fact
everything  is uploaded anonymously.  MiggyByte is not officially classed
as a magazine but a as a computer application, such as a help guide.  The
Term  magazine  is loosely used.  The opinions expressed in this magazine
are not necessarily those held by any of the editors.
