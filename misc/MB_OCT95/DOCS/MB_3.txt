Wellcome  to issue 2 of MiggyByte, the disk mag you have all been waiting
for.   Hmm  well  its  been a busy month for me, starting back at Uni and
finishing  up all my decorating jobs.  So this month Defacto has done the
news round up, and done a bloody good job of it too.

So  whats in this issue, well the usual load of stuff BUT one major scoop
is  the  text  on  the Escom stores.  Its shocking to know how little the
shop  staff  at  Escom  know  about  the  Amiga.  Some don't even know it
exists!   And  those that do wouldn't recomemed it to act as a door stop!
Why  this  is  who  knows,  but  if  its not sorted out soon then Escom's
investment in the Amiga is going to cost them.

While  I'm  here  I would like to say a *BIG* thank you to Adrian Webster
for the brill pic of the MiggyByte logo you saw on the intro screen.

Thats all from me this month so till next time...
