                   Internet, Pirate Capital of the world ?

                             By Sigma Alpha

I  was listening to Talk Radio Uk a while back, there was a phone call to
'GEEZER'  about  the  InterNet.   It was about Pirate sites, he could not
believe that it was possible for these to go unmonitored.  So to show how
easy  it is to find out EXACTLY where you can find such areas we obtained
a few lists that were readily available from a local BBS.

Looking  down  this  list  we  found  a  wide range of areas for variable
formats.   Below  are a list of some of the material that was found.  the
ones that are listed are no longer available, or are from old out of date
lists.

1.  huh.harvard.edu             /pub/contributions/"..  "/

This  Shows  an  example  of  a  site that proves that such things can go
unmonitored  even  from  the  sources  end.   Could  you  believe that an
institution  such  as  Harvard  would  be the site of illegal pirating of
software.

140.115.199.199            login:secret  passwd:hahaha          MAC warez

Here  we  have  an  example of how even usernames and passwords are given
away with this information.

This  is not the only freely available illegal material available via FTP
sites,   also   included  in  these  lists  are  sites  advertising  hard
pornographic material, these sites we do not even show.

This  shows  what half an hour of research can pick up, just imagine what
professional  'traders'  can  do with there on line time and connections.
Maybe  this  proves that the internet is a very powerful tool that pirate
traders,  crakers  have  to  aid  in  their work.  These signs prove that
piracy  is  not  just limited to BBS`S and that it is wide spread even on
the  internet.  So next time you here people say there's no piracy on the
`net,  you`ll there talking shit, can you believe that Harvard has pirate
warez on its servers!.

Please  note  the above sites have are old and may have been closed down,
and MiGGYBYTE does not encourage the its users to logon onto these sites.

IMPORTANT:
Please  note that although some of these sites are to be found on big and
prominent  servers,  from  top  Universities to small InterNet providers.
This  doesn't mean that the sites the illegal warez are found on are part
of  that sites service.  The illegal sites are usually set up via illegal
access (Hacking) with out the knowledge of the sites/server providers.

In  short  these  illegal  sites exist because of bad security and poorly
maintained services.
