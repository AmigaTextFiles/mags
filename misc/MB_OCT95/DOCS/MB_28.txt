                        By Peripheral

Last  issue i covered the topics of Hard Drives etc, as promised heres my
follow  up the accelerators.  I will generally cover accelerators for AGA
machines but read on!.
                            THE BASICS

Firstly  let  me  explain the basics to you.  An accelerator is usually a
`card`  which  plugs  in  somewhere  in your amiga, and gives you a speed
increase  over your previous setup.  For example a Amiga 500 runs at 7mhz
and does under a mip, whilst the A1200 does 14mhz and does about 1.2mips.
Ah yes but what is a mip?, well a mip stands for Million Instructions Per
Second.   You  should really look at the mip rating of a processor if you
want  to compare.  Like for instance a You may think a Intel DX2/66mhz is
more  powerful than a 040 at 25mhz but there roughly the same.  The 68040
chip  used  inside a Amiga 4000 is as powerful as a 486DX2 peecee.  So if
your  peecee m8`s says that `my machine 486dx2 is faster than your A4000,
he's  talking  shit.   Note  do you notice that the 486 runs at twice the
speed  to  achieve the same processor power?.  An FPU is a Floating Point
Unit  this  does  all  the  those  hard maths calculations that slow your
Processor  down and relieves some of the strain on it.  A MMU is a Memory
Management  Unit  and allows you to do whizzy things such as virtual ram,
imagine  having a 128meg ram!, unfortunately its rather slow and you need
a  Hard  Drive.   Adding a accelerator will greatly improve your machine,
you  can  then  play  gloom at full speed, full screen without it slowing
down  a  bit!.  Also your 3D rendering and access times will be shorter!,
Yipee!.


                           Ok Down to it!

There  are many accelerators for The A1200 ranging from just a FPU add on
to 020`s and even 060`s!.  The most basic accelerator you can get for the
A1200  is a FPU ram combination this gives a FPU that will speed up maths
operations  and  you  can  add  extra  ram  so  you can run more than one
application  as  once  or  load  a  really  big  picture  into  ram  etc.
Unfortunately  the  FPU  wont speed up your whole system only maths stuff
that supports it, so even if you`ve got a FPU, your games wont get faster
unless they support a FPU.

Next  are  the  020 processors you can get.  These cards also offer extra
ram  to be put in but are `clocked doubled` which means they run at twice
the  speed  of  a normal CPU.  The 020 cards run at 28mhz so this doubles
your  CPU speed by two if you`ve got a A1200.  Next up are the 030 cards,
now  things  start to get complicated.  They come in different speeds all
the  way  up  to  50mhz, the 50mhz 030 does 10-12mips roughly the same as
486sx  CPU, you can also purchase a FPU to go with the 030 cards, some of
them  even  include a SCSI-II interface card, so you can use SCSI devices
etc.   the  Price for a 030/50Mhz is about 200 pounds (UK).  You can also
add  up  to 128meg ram on board.  If you`ve got the money i recommend you
go  for  the  030/50mhz  cards  or 40mhz versions.  These make your A1200
faster  than  a A4000/030.  They also offer great flexibility.  Note when
purchasing  make sure the CPU is not `Clock Doubled` cause this may cause
overheating  problems.   You  can  also  purchase 030 cards for all other
amigas including a500`s

              040 AND THE 060 NOW YOUR TALKING POWER

Now  are the next range of the Motorola Series of CPU`S the 68040 and the
68060.   The  040  is  the same CPU as the one in the A4000T, it performs
20mips at 25mhz roughly.  A1200 040`s have only now been possible because
of  a  new  version of the 040 with only uses 3.3v and much cooler to run
and  doesn't  overheat  that  quickly.  By getting on of these your Amiga
will  run  like  a Horse who`s been poked in the ass with a red hot pole.
You  can  run  many  programs at once without your Amiga slowing down too
much  and  do  some  serious  graphic  work.   the A1200/040 has the same
features  as the 030 cards for the A1200, including SCSI-II interface etc
expect to pay about 400 quid for one.

The  68060  is the last in the 68000 Series of CPU`s by Motorola and this
CPU is like having a `Galaxy Class StarShip` shoved up you backside doing
warp  9.9.   The CPU offers 100mips at 50mz (Peak Performance) But you`ll
get  about  82mips  i  think out of it.  The CyberStorm Board for big box
amigas is excellent if you`ve got a bigBox then get this!  It has so many
features  to  list!.  You can get a 1200/60 CPU upgrade and will cost you
about  600  pounds  for  the A1200 and about 700-800 pounds for bigboxes.
This CPU outdoes a pentium 100 at 50mhz, new version are due to come soon
at 66mhz and 90mhz i think!.  This is a pentium killer!.


Note:  To achieve good performance out of your CPU Accelerator you should
buy  at  least  2meg  Fast  Ram,  this  increase  your  speed  even more,
Especially  IDE  based  amigas  such as the a1200, if you can afford 2meg
then  get  1meg  but if your not gonna buy extra ram, then you`ll only be
using your CPU at a lower efficiency.

Anyway  thats  all  for  this  time  I'll  be back, maybe next issue with
something else.  if you have any comments send em into MiGGYBYTE so i can
read em.  Chow!
