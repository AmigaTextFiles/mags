                        The Hacker Crackdown
                        ====================

Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier

By Bruce Sterling

Published by Penguin        ISBN 0-14-017734-5

OK here is a quote from the Introduction of the book, 

'This  book  is  about cops, and wild teenage whiz kids, and lawyers, and
hairy-eyed  anarchists, and industrial technicians, and hippies, and high
tech millionaires, and game hobbyists, and computer security experts, and
Secret Service agents, and grifters, and thieves.  This book is about the
electronic frontier of the 1990s.  It concerns activities that take place
inside computers and over telephone lines.'

Thats  basically  the  book  all  summed  up, but for one major thing THE
CRACKDOWN.   The book follows the exploits of many Hackers, Phone Phreaks
and computer users across the US.  Then as the authorities gain knowledge
of  the  scale  of  computer  hacking  the typical paranoid US government
starts  a crackdown.  The crackdown in it self is a total farce, coasting
the  US  tax  payer  thousands  if  not  millions and very few people are
charged.

The one thing that makes this book stand head and tails above the rest is
the  way Bruce Sterling explains the terminology of the hackers and their
methods,  thus  making  the  book real easy to read and understand.  This
book is still the best book on computer hacking and fraud.

Oh yea there are one hell of a lot of hackers in the world using Amiga's,
is this good?  

I dunno.
