                               By Defacto

Stimpy  paint  is  the  latest  paint package available on PD.  it has no
connection  with  Ren  &  Stimpy  but  is the latest from Stimpy Software
House.

Sorry not to have any screen shots due to the fact that its not out until
the  middle  of October.  Stimpy paint well, is basically like ever other
paint  package  except It's humerus into the bargain.  If you try to save
into  any  pc format then a face comes up on the screen and says 'Joker'.
This  has  to be seen to be believed, also if you try to select over 4096
colours then the face comes up again onto the screen and says 'You should
buy a Pentium'

If  you  can  bare  to see a balding head on the screen when you do these
things on the screen then maybe this is the package for you.

Stimpy  paint  also has a inbuilt game, you have to buy all the pieces to
make  up a pc i.e ram cards video cards keyboard cards.  This is a rather
boring  part  of it, the only way anyone will ever complete it is if they
own a pc and have put such a machine together.
