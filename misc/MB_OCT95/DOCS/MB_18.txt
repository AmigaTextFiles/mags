A CD-ROM full of ZX-Spectrum snapshots
Cost:
Available from: 17 Bit Software (01924 366982)

Oh  those  glory  days,  when  the  UK  rocked  to  the  Bleep of a 8-bit
ZX-Spectrum.   Yes all of you out there know I just love the ZX-Spectrum,
well  when  this  CD  poped through my door it was like being back in the
80's,   sitting  in  my  room  wrestling  with  an  old  Atari  joystick.
Desperately trying to pick up that last part of the rocket in JetPack and
finish the very last level.
I  never did finish JetPack but it must have been one of the most popular
games on the ZX-Spectrum.

I  spose  I best tell you a bit about the CD-ROM, [CLICK FIG BUTTON] well
it  contains  thousand or so of .sna and .Z80 files to be loaded into you
favourite  ZX-Spectrum  emulator.   The CD- ROM also contains ZX-Spectrum
emulators for the Amiga, PC, Mac, and Atari ST.  BUT most important there
is  a  DIR on the disk full of doc's for some of the games on the CD-ROM,
now  this  is  a life saver no more racking your brain trying to remember
how to/what to do in a game.

If  you  like  Mono  style  graphics  and  real gameplay and hundreds and
hundreds of games then this CD is an absolute must.

Sysops  note  this  CD is not BBS ready, but with a bit of cleaver use of
the list command you will get the CD online in a matter of mins.

Madness
