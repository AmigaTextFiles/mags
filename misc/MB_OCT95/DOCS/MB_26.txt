                            Forms Editor


 I was working in the forms editor on an object, and loaded it
into  the  detail  editor  for modification.  However, I can't seem to be
able to get it back into the forms editor!  Help!

        Simply  put, you cannot load objects saved from the detail editor
back  into  the  forms editor.  The reason is the forms editor requires a
specified  object  structure  which the detail does not.  Thus, saving an
object in the detail editor loses that information.

        When  you work with the forms editor is recommended that you keep
a spare copy of the FORMS OBJECT saved separately from any detail object.
In  this  way  you  can  then go back and make modifications in the forms
editor.


                            Cycle Editor


I made this really great animation sequence in the cycle editor, but when
I set it up in the stage/action editors, the motion of the overall object
isn't there!

        When  using  the  cycle editor, Imagine only remembers changes in
size,  position,  and so on in relation to the main parent.  Thus, if you
make  a  change to the parent object, it gets forgotten.  What this means
is  if  you  make  a  nifty robot jumping cycle, and make it in the cycle
editor  so the robot actually move up etc...  all that will be remembered
is  the  changes  to  the legs, arms and anything OFF of the PARENT.  The
overall rotations and movements to the main object will be gone.

        Two  solutions exist.  One is to simply make those changes in the
stage  editor each time you need to.  The second is to group a plain axis
before  you  start  to  your  object.   (ie:  Make the parent have a Null
link).   Then,  you  can  rotate  everything  by  rotating the main child
grouped  right  under  this  null  axis.   This way you aren't moving the
"parent", and everything will be remembered.


             Animation, Stage Editor and Action Editor


Even    though    I    move    an    Object/Camera/Light    to    a   new
POSITION/ALIGNMENT/SIZE  in  the  STAGE editor, Imagine seems to 'forget'
what I did!

    All  objects must have timeliness split wherever there is a change in
position,  alignment  or  size.   If you do not set this up, Imagine will
forget the changes no matter what.

    Rather  than  going  back and forth to the ACTION editor and adding ,
you  can  have  Imagine  automatically  create the properly so everything
tweens  as  normal.   There  are  the "Position Bar", "Alignment Bar" and
"Size Bar" commands under the OBJECT menu in the STAGE editor.

    So,  if  you have just gone to a frame and are making a new POSITION,
ALIGNMENT  or  SIZE for an object (or camera or light) to tween to, press
RIGHT  AMIGA  and 7/8/9 respectively.  Or use the respective bar commands
>from the OBJECT menu.  This will extend or put a 'split' in the timeline
for you (you can check this in the ACTION editor).  Also, don't forget to
"Save Changes"if you want to keep the motion!



 How do I use the Grow Effect?

        To  use  the  grow  effect, create an object in the DETAIL editor
that  you  wish  to  have  'extrude'  over time.  Create a spline path as
normal  in  the detail editor.  This will be the path the object extrudes
along during the animation.

    GROUP  (not  join) the object with the PATH AS THE PARENT.  If you do
not  make  the path the parent, it will not work.  To do this, select the
path,  then  hold  shift  and select the object, then select group.  Save
your GROUP for loading in the animation.

    Finally, add the effect in the ACTION editor for the grouped object.



How do I use the Tumble Effect?

    The  tumble  effect  is  used  to  tumble 1 or more objects during an
animation.   To  tumble  an  object, create your object or objects in the
DETAIL editor.  Still in the detail editor add an axis.

        Group  (not  join) the AXIS to all the objects you want to tumble
with  the  AXIS AS THE PARENT.  Then load the GROUP into the STAGE/ACTION
editor and add the effect as normal.

    NOTE:   The  reason  for  the  null  object  (axis) as parent is that
Imagine does not TUMBLE the PARENT, just the children.



How  do you get something to roll (at the right speed!) while following a
path?

        Getting  an  object to spin (like a plane doing a barrel roll) is
easy-  you  align to path, then set Y rotation to be from 0 to 360 and it
will  do  a  complete  spin.   This  is  not in the right direction for a
rolling ball, though.  [Annoying feature- you can't say from 0 to 720 for
two  spins,  or  0 to 3600 for ten.] To get it to roll I created a second
path,  which  was basically a larger copy of the first, so the first path
was  just inside of the second path.  I had an axis (a track) follow this
new,  outside  path, then used "align to object" to make the sphere point
to the axis.

        Thus,  as  the ball moved along its path, one end (the positive Y
axis  direction)  was  always pointed at right angles to the direction of
motion.   Is  this  clear?   Now using the "initial Y angle" and "final Y
angle" I set them to 0 and 360 and it rotated as it rolled.  As a special
effect,  I  raised  the  "track  path" a little in the Z direction so the
sphere  looks a little bit like a top rolling around, since the spin axis
was not horizontal any more.

        An  alternative  would  be to make a cycle object, rolling around
the X axis.  This is equally valid, but I did it this way first.



When  I move a tracked Camera in the STAGE editor, it doesn't realign and
draw the Perspective view correctly!

    If  you  have  Imagine 2.0 or higher, press RIGHT AMIGA and the K key
together,  or  select "Camera (Re)track" from the OBJECT menu.  This will
make  the  camera  repoint  to  the  track from the new position and will
redraw the perspective view.

        If  you have an older version of Imagine (or if you just want to)
you  can  press RIGHT AMIGA and the C key or select "Goto" from the FRAME
menu.   Go  to  the  current  frame  you  are already on which will cause
imagine to redraw everything.



I  have  found  that after creating a scene in the Stage editor, and then
deciding  that I want an animation and adjusting the highest frame count,
my scene gets mangled in the first frame.  Why?

        Well,  it  seems  to  me that this will happen if you don't split
your  channel  bar  from  the  first  frame  (where  you want stuff to be
exactly)  to  the second frame.  I usually setup my scenes so that I have
the  first  frame all set as it should be and then I do my transformation
>from  frames  2-whatever.   In this way, the first frame is ALWAYS where
it's  suppose  to  be  no  matter  what  changes  I make in the remaining
animation.   If  you  look at your channel it should have a break between
frames  1  and 2 and then be continuous (if that's the way your animation
works out) from 2 on.
