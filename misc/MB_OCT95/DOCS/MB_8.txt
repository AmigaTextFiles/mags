                         All new Amiga Monitor
                         =====================

One  of  the main problems with buying a Monitor for the AGA based Amigas
is  the  price  and  the  specifications.   Till now there has not been a
specific monitor built with the Amiga in mind.

Amiga Technologies have announced there is to be a new Amiga monitor with
full  support  for  the  AGA  screen  modes.   The  monitor has multisync
capabilities and has a scan rate from 15 to 38khz, 28" dot pitch and will
retail at £299 for a 14" screen version.  Other sizes are soon to follow.

The monitor is said to be made/converted by a major European manufacturer.
