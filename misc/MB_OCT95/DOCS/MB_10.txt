                     New version of D-Opus V5.2
                     ==========================

In  a  recent  chat on IRC the author D-Opus 5 announced there is to be a
new version that has many improvements over the old version.

Improved GUI
Borderless button banks
Alternative images for Toolmanger users

Better Arexx support

To  list  just a few of the improvements.  The new version is expected in
the  shops  soon  and  there  will/should be an upgrade path for existing
users.
