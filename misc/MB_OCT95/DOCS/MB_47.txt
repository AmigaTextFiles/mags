                        Star Trek: Generations

                           By George Rivers


This  film  has had mixed feelings thrown at it.  Some say that it is the
best  of  the ST films so far with a great plot, with the transition from
the  old generation to the next generation.  Others say that the film was
an  insult to the very fibers of the code laid down by gene rodenbery the
creator  of Star Trek.  Most fans that I know could not believe that they
killed off their beloved James T Kirk, well I suppose that he can't go on
forever,  he was part of the old generation that has now moved over so he
must take his place in the history books.

The  film  however  I thought was great it had everything the old and new
cast in one film what more could a trekkie want?  Picard and kirk team up
to  fight  the  "baddie" Kirk was already trapped form the nexus after it
hitting into the Enterprise B after it was called to answer a SOS.  After
one  of  those boring so many years later captions we are now on the high
seas watching Picard on the gang give a promotion to worf.  So we move on
to  the  end  now after skipping the usual mayhem that we all know as the
middle  bit  of  ST.   Kirk  always  rated as the best fighter of the two
tackels  the  baddie  a fight brakes out and Oh surprise Kirk whipped his
ass.   So  he  proves  once again he is the best fighter of the two after
earlier seeing picard losing HaHaHahA weak bald bastard.

So basically that's it, i have left out bags of detail so that you can go
and see the movie and see some of the best bits!

**********************
HIGHLIGHT OF THE MOVIE
**********************

After  Riker  is  left in charge of the enterprise, he somehow manages to
fuck things up and crash the enterprise on the nearest planet Oh Dear..

At the end we do not hear thing from Picard about Riker's ability to park
the  enterprise,  I  wonder  how  many penalty points he gonna get on his
licence and if he will loose his no claims bonus?
