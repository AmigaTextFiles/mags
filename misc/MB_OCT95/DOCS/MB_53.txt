                              =========

Hello  to  all  you Miggybyte readers and welcome to "Dear Suki", your very
own problem page.

For  those  of  you  who  have  not  as  yet  had the pleasure, allow me to
introduce  myself.   I  am the afore-mentioned Suki, Barmaid of Barnet, and
wise  woman  extraordinaire.  I am a 27 year old artist, writer, mother and
domestic goddess, with a fondness for lager and chocolate.

My  knowledge  of things computery is limited - I'm quite happy to use one,
without having the slightest idea of how it all works!  (A bit like driving
the  car,  really!   Happy  to use one, but ignorant of the workings of the
internal  combustion  engine!)  However, if you need to know anything about
life,  sex, relationships, alcohol (and how to survive the after-effects!),
cake,  chocolate,  photography,  art,  music,  underwear or books, I'm your
woman!

This  page is for solving any problems you may have, handing out advice and
discussing  dilemmas.   If  something's  bothering  you,  don't  keep it to
yourself,  write  to  Dear  Suki  and let your personal Agony Aunt put your
world  to  rights!  Or if you just have a point of view or word of greeting
you wish to share with me, then go ahead!

So,  get  uploading  those  queries and problems to Miggybyte, and let Suki
sort you out!

If you don't know where to upload then read the 'Contacting Miggybyte'
article.
