LSD  3  is just one of those CD you sling in your drive and start running
the  demos,  listening  to  the  music,  reading  the  texts, viewing the
pictures, playing the anims, playing the games.....etc etc etc

It  goes  on  and on, and after 5 hours you suddenly realise how long you
have been sitting there.  This has got to be one of the best compilations
of any CD, better than LSD's previous ones?

Basically what the CD-ROM contains is the standard array of music, games,
art  etc  files [CLICK FIG BUTTON].  Some files are ready to run from the
CD  like some of the Demos and the Music mods.  But most of the files are
packed  with  Lha  or  DMS so they need to be unpacked before they can be
used etc.  Some people might see this as a disadvantage, but remember you
get a lot more for your money when the files are packed ;)

A CD well worth a look.

Sysops  note:   The  CD  is BBS ready but the file list leave a lot to be
required  and  you  will probably be better off using the List command to
make your own lists up.  Basically thats the only fault with the CD.
