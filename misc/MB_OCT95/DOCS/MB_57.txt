                        Next month in MiggyByte
                        =======================

Well  I'm not gonna predict anything for next's month as its bound not to
happen or I get it wrong as usual.  BUT we do hope to have AB3d and Fears
and Gloom all reviewed by then, having played Gloom and the demos of AB3d
and  Fears  I think that AB3d is probably the best, but fears is a closer
Doom clone and Gloom has better graphics especially on the second world!

Might also have that Zip drive too if I can get my hands on one........

Madness
