                           by Mark Klocek

This  program  is just a picture converter with a small amount of effects
which  are  flip,  rotate  and reduce colours (with optional dither).  It
loads  in  quite  a  few  picture  formats including IFF, GIF, JPEG, PCX,
RGB-Raw  and  unfortunately  there is no support for datatypes.  But only
saves the above and Postscript out.

There are two versions of the program the 68000+ and the 68020+ versions,
and  there  are two versions of the manual one in German and the other in
English.

To  begin  with  I  loaded  in  an 88k BMP 2 colour picture.  GFXcon took
2.3megs  of  my HD as 'virtual memory' and the loading process was pretty
slow.

Then  I  converted a HAM6 landscape picture to a 256 GIF.  This went fine
but  the  colours  on 256 version were not very good, however it would be
good to convey 256 colour IFFs to GIF to save some HD space

GFXCon  is  generally an okay program.  Although it takes a long time and
some  HD  space,  it  will  do  the  job  adequately  and with no hassles
otherwise.   It appears to be quite stable, though if you don't have much
HD  space  it  will be a drag to click those requesters when it tells you
its  full  and then having to redo the thing again.  It has been designed
to  convert  images  and  if  you  don't expect any more then you will be
happy.

If it is compared to many commercial packages and the brilliant shareware
package Image Studio then it loses out.

Overall rating...............................................76%

Its  okay  but only if you have a substantial amount of HD space, you are
poor  and  you don't mind waiting a little while.  Almost a good program.
Bear  in mind that the program is two years old with only enhancements to
use AGA graphics and its free.
