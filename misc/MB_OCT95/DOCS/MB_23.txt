Yet another Tetris clone, but hey wait a minute this one is rather neat.

So  yes  WinTris is basically a Tetris clone with no real extras over the
original  but what it does is run under workbench and is system friendly.
So  when  that docs printing or that disk is being formatted etc, no more
sitting there twiddling your thumbs play WinTris.

Once  started by double clicking its icon it opens up two windows on your
workbench,  one contains the game status, score, next block and hi-score.
The  other  window  contains  the main playing area, a point worth noting
here  is you can scale up/down the playing window to your own liking.  So
if  you  want  a  playing  area so big you can see it two streets away no
probs  or  if you want a playing area so small you will need a microscope
to see it, also no probs [CLICK FIG BUTTON].

To  round up, WinTris is a brill workbench game that will take away those
boredom  blues when your waiting for your latest Imagine render to finish
:) Well worth a look/download.

Madness
