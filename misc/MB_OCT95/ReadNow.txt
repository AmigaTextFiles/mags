    MIGGYBYTE AMINET VERSION
    ========================

 Because aminet do not allow DMS files to be put onto their library I had to
 make a new program that would allow the magazine to be loaded direct from
 hard-drive instead of residing on it's own boot-disk!

 To use miggybyte Make sure you have amos.library in the libs directory on
 you're hard disk. If you do not simply copy it from the libs directory that
 will now be inside the directory you unpacked to.

 The program will need to be run from CLI until I get the author to make a
 few changes :-) Simply change directory (cd) to the directory you unpacked
 to and type :

 mbrun

 it is a simple program that sets up the required assign and also checks
 if the decruncher module has been loaded and if not loads it.

 If you have any problems using Miggybyte or would like the original DMS
 file then contact me at : petekirby@aworld.demon.co.u

 I am also often on IRC as Freestyle. #amiga :)
