                             @{I}Editor's Notes...@{UI}



Isn't it just in such typical Amiga fashion...
The Day of Decision came and went without event.
September 20 was the day that the proposed deal between VIScorp and the
creditors currently controlling ESCOM's assets was supposed to be finalized. Was it? No. In fact, we're still waiting for results. One might begin to wonder if we will ever get anywhere.

Well, it is autumn, and over here in the United States, the New York Yankees
have advanced into the Major League Baseball playoffs. They were a dynasty
team for much of the century, winning an amazing number of World Series
Championships, but it's been a number of years since they have enjoyed such
success.

And where has the Amiga been? Rather displaced...since the beginning of the
decade, that is. And, of course, the last 2 years or so have been the worst
of them all. Worse yet, we really don't know what to expect at this point.

The Yankees had an interesting series last week, but managed to get through
it and advance to the next level. But they sure had us wondering for a
little while there! Us New York baseball fans, however, are happy about
this; they might just make it.

So can a little of that fall magic rub off on the Amiga? Will it get through
this difficult, seemingly impossible stage? Well, the Yankees managed it
last week, but then again, no matter what happens, they'll still be there
next year.

Of course, it's not too late to believe the platform might survive; after
all, it's lived through the most arduous times imaginable.

But in any event, here's the pitch...

OCTOBER 19-20, COLUMBUS OHIO, USA:

At that time and place, there will be a gathering of various Amiga companies
and groups, hosted by AmiCON (The Amiga Central Ohio Network). Among those
slated to be present are VIScorp, QuikPak, Silent Paw Productions, Nova
Design, and many more. The list is still growing, and for the
http://www.amicon.org/mae.html

Attendees of this show can expect to find out a good deal of information
about new or soon-to-be Amiga products. In addition, on October 20 (the
second day of the event), all developers/vendors present (including VIScorp)
will be involved in a "Roundtable Discussion" that will give an open forum
to the audience to ask any questions they might have.

The Midwest Amiga Exposition should bring many important issues to the fore,
and provide an interesting look at some products the Amiga community can
expect to see shortly. In addition, it will be a chance for Amiga users to
meet for a few days and exchange ideas, predictions, or thoughts in general
on affairs in the Amiga community.

One issue of which potential attendees should be aware is the following, as
stated by a representative of AmiCON:

@{I}"We did find out one disturbing fact:
The Quarterhorse Congress is in town for several weeks, and we have had a
hard time finding rooms for those who are from out of town. Regrettably, I
don't have any other ideas for overnight accommodations; there are other
places nearby, but they appear to be booked as well.  The only thing I can
tell these people is to check with a travel agent or triple A to find
accommodations."

See AmiCON's web site at http___www.amicon.org for more information.

FTP


@{I}FTP: A very useful system of transferring files over the internet @{UI}

mailto: d.green7@genie.com"
@{U}                                                                           @{UU}



This article will concentrate on another excellent but often overlooked
internet tool, FTP.  I will show you an example of what iscalled "Anonymous
FTP".  This means that you will be dealing with a host computer on which you
don't have an account.

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is used to retrieve files from
another computer.  The files can be retrieved in two formats, binary and
text.  Binary is the format programs are in (they contain non-text
characters).  Text is usually ASCII.

Using FTP is very easy. I will use Aminet as an example.  First type
"FTP aminet.com".  Upon connection you will presented with a welcome screen
with a banner "NETNET". This is the current home of the Aminet archives.
You should see a message that says "Using binary modeto transfer files."  If
not you will have to change the file mode after you log on.  We will get to
that later.  You will be prompted to enter a name. The great thing is that
you have already been provided with one. (aminet.com:anonymous).  Just hit
return. You will then be prompted for a password. Since you are using
anonymous you will be expected to input your E-mail address. Once again it
should have already been put in for you.  In my case it is
"(d.green7@genie.com):" so just hit return. If all goes well you should get
a message telling you guest logon is OK.  It will also tell you that
restrictions apply.  The restrictions are because you do not have an account
on the host computer. Don't worry, the restrictions shouldn't cause you
any problems.  From here on in, if you are familiar with DOS, (Amiga or MS)
you will feel right at home. To get a directory you type... you guessed it...
"dir".   You will be presented with a list of files and directories.

The columns contain different information on the files and directories.  The
important columns for our example are the first and last.  If you look at
the first digit in the first column you will see that some of the rows start
with a "d".  This tells us that is a directory.  The directory we want is
pub.  The host that we are on is UNIX, so everything is Case sensitive.
That means if you type PUB instead of pub, the system will reply that it
can't find a directory PUB.  Type "cd pub."  This will put you in the
directory pub. If you check the contents, you will find mostly directories.
The one we want of course, is aminet.

Cd aminet and call up a directory and you will see the familiar list of
directories and files.  I recommend that you get the index.  It is listed
twice, once as INDEX and again as INDEX.Z.  They are the same file, the
"z" suffix on the second one indicates that it is in a compressed format. To
get the file use the "get" command.  Use the format "get INDEX" or
"getINDEX.Z" for which ever version you want. Unfortunately I don't know
of anywhere to get a program to decompress .Z files except on Genie. If I
find a site I will certainly post it.  If you did not get the message "Using
binary mode to transfer files" when you logged on earlier, type "binary" to
switch the system.  The other mode is ASCII.  For a list of commands for FTP
type "help".  That will bring up a list of commands the system understands.
Use the cdup command to get the "parent" directory of the one that you are
in.  For example if you are in pub/aminet/games and you want to back up to
animet, type "cdup;" this will take you to the parent directory.  When you
are finished exploring, the command to leave is "bye".   I hope you have
enjoyed this quick tour.

aspects of the Amiga from day 1 to today. @{UI}

@{I}Devices, Memory, and Disks@{UI}

@{LINDENT 4}

*  

@{B}DEVICE@{UB} - Anything you can send and/or receive information to/from
such as disk drives, modems, printers, CD-ROM drives, digitizers, etc.  Even
the screen is considered a DEVICE, as is the keyboard.  We will look at the
most used devices later.

*  

@{B}MEMORY@{UB} - An area where the computer stores information. Some of it
is available to you to use; some of it is for the computer only.  Every
computer (and nearly every modern day electronic device such as wrist
watches and microwave ovens) has at least SOME memory.  There are MANY
different types on some systems; the Amiga is one of them.

*  

@{B}ROM@{UB} - Read Only Memory.  This is memory that can only beread from
but not written to.  The actual computer operating system (called Kickstart
since it is actually required to 'start' your system) is contained on a
replaceable chip inside the computer.  This ROM contains permanent
information the system needs to run.

*  

@{B}RAM@{UB} - Random Access Memory.  Memory that you can load programs,
graphics, and sound into for the computer to use.  It is volatile, which
means that when the computer is shut off (or rebooted using
CTRL-LEFT AMIGA-RIGHT AMIGA) this memory is reset and (most of the time)
lost.  There are some ways around that which we will look at later when we
talk about viruses.  There are several types of RAM used in the Amiga, each
one with a different purpose.

*  

@{B}RAM (Fast)@{UB} - Fast RAM is used to store programs used by the central
processor (the heart of the computer: a Motorola 68000 series
microprocessor).  In most early Amigas this is often 16-bit memory (more on
that later) since the 68000 is a 16-bit processor. If your machine is
equipped with an accelerator (68020, 68030, or 68040 CPU) then you have a
32-bit processor which runs considerably faster that the 68000.  This CPU
requires (obviously) 32-bit Fast RAM to run at its optimum performance.
If you only have 16-bit Fast RAM and a 32-bit processor, your machine may
not seem as fast as it should, since the processor cannot operate at the
speeds you paid for.  16-bit Fast RAM is occasionally called SLOW RAM.  You
can put up to eight megs on a processor with a 24-bit address register, such
as the 16-bit 68000, (with some exceptions) and for all practical purposes,
pretty much unlimited (based on the weight of your pocketbook) on a 32-bit
processor.
This RAM can usually be added by sticking in a board or plugging in a box on
the computer.  In any event, the custom chips (moreon that later) cannot use
any form of FAST RAM for storage.

*  

@{B}RAM (Chip)@{UB} - Since the Amiga is a true multitasking machine, it has
several custom processors (called the CUSTOM CHIPSET) to handle almost every
function of the computer, leaving the CPU free to do the basic number
crunching and program execution.  These custom processors require their own
memory in which to store their own programs.  The memory they are designed
to use is called (appropriately enough) Chip RAM.  In older Amigas it was
set at 512K (one half a megabyte).  Then, a modification came out to let you
have one megabyte of Chip RAM.  The latest Amigas have two megs of Chip RAM.
Since all the graphics and sound are stored here, it is easy to see why 'the
more the merrier' is quite true when it comes to Chip RAM.  Chip RAM *CAN*
be used by the CPU if no Fast RAM is available.  But, this is not desired
since Chip RAM is about 20% slower than the 16-bit Fast RAM.
Chip RAM is very costly and difficult to add.  It also has a little flaw in
it called FRAGMENTATION.  More on that later on.

*  

@{B}DISK@{UB} - A disk device (or drive) comes in many forms with lots of
different names.  All drives require a CONTROLLER to talk between them and
the computer.  The disk drive that is built into all Amigas is a 3.5" Floppy
disk drive.  Note: although the 3.5" disk casing is hard plastic, the actual
media inside the casing is floppy so it is still considered a floppy disk.
Thecomputer has a built in floppy drive controller that will allow up to four
floppy drives to be connected and accessed at one time.  Hard Disk Drives
actually use rigid plastic disks to store data.  These are hermetically
sealed inside the case and you will probably never see what a platter (the
disk itself) actually looks like.  They hold a great deal more than their
floppy counterparts and also require a controller to operate.  Older Amigas
do not have this controller built in so it must be purchased with the drive
to use.  A CD-ROM drive works the same way, basically.  It also requires a
controller but stores its information in little pits on the disc.  These
pits are of different depths which represent numbers that the computer can
actually change into a program to run.
All controlled devices need a software program 'patch' or devicefile to
allow them to talk from the controller to the computer.  These are located
in your DEVS: directory on your Workbench Disk or hard drive partition.
Floppy drives are denoted as DF0 - DF3 and hard drives are usually denoted
as DH0 - DH?.  The Amiga internal disk drives are all double density (with
the exception of the A4000) and hold 880K of data when formatted.  There are
some utilities out there that will allow you to increase this number to 936K
or so.

*  

@{B}RAM DISK@{UB} - This is a special device.  It allocates your memory as a
'mini disk drive' to allow temporary storage of files and data.  On your
Workbench, you should see an icon that says RAM DISK or RAM.  This is just
like a disk drive and you can copy to, delete from, install programs to, and
manipulate it just like the disk drive counterparts.  Its capacity is
limited to your total available memory (displayed on the title bar of your
Workbench disk).  It does not need to be 'formatted' to be used.It is ready
as soon as you see its icon.  WARNING!  It uses RAM to hold what is in it so
if you reset your computer, crash it, a power failure occurs, etc. anything
there will be LOST!  There is a device you can create called a RAD, which is
like a RAM DISK, but will survive anything but turning the computer off (or
power loss).  You can crash it, reset it, etc. and it will still be there
when your Workbench loads. @{I}(Editor's note: if a program actually causing
a crash overwrites data in RAD: on the way to the great guru in the sky,
that information can be lost, but this is fairly uncommon) @{UI}

*  

@{B}PRT@{UB} - Printer device.  You can specify which device to send a file
to in most Amiga programs.  For instance, if you are working on a database
and you want to save it to the internal floppy drive, you might enter a
filename called DF0:DATABASE. With the Amiga, you can send it right to the
printer!  Simply enter PRT:DATABASE and it will send the file to your
printer! Since you set your printer type in the PREFs (more later), all
programs can make use of the special features of that printer.

*  

@{B}SER@{UB} - Serial device. This is the device that lets you talk to the
serial port (used mostly by modems and printers).  Likethe PRT device you
just need to use SER as the device name.

*  

@{B}PAR@{UB} - Parallel device.  Talks to the parallel port.  This is the
most common port used by printers.  Unless you are talking to another Amiga
via a Parnet cable, the PRT would be better to use if you want to send
something to the printer.

*  

@{B}CON@{UB} - Console device.  The computer itself! If you send a file to
the console device, it will display on your screen using your CON: device
parameters.
@{LINDENT 0}


If a lot of this doesn't make sense right now; be patient. Rome wasn't built
in a day; nor was your Amiga.  Give yourself some time to learn.
@{I}What are the Amiga Custom Chips? @{UI}


In the first Amiga, the A1000, the chips "Agnus," "Paula," and"Denise" did
the hard work.  They together build a specialized multiprocessor system that
takes much of the time-critical load off of the main processor.  This
includes the plain display of image information, 4-channel sound output,
floppy control, general DMA control, and much more.  In the newest Amigas
you find the "AGA chipset", which consists of the original "Paula" and the
advanced chips named "Alice" (the replacement for Agnus) and "Lisa" (the
replacement for Denise).
@{I}What are OCS, ECS, AGA, and AA?@{UI}


Over the years, the chipset was redesigned several times.  The first chipset
in the Amiga 1000 is called the OCS, for Original Chip Set. It consists of
the chips Paula, Agnus, and Denise.  With these, you can display graphics in
resolutions up to 640x512 (or 640x400, depending on whether you had the
American or European version) and in up to 4096 colors, a fantastic
achievement in 1985.

The next generation was ECS, the Enhanced Chip Set. The chip names remained
unchanged, except some minor additions like "Fat Agnus".  Only Agnus and
Denise were changed. Compared to OCS, they provided higher resolutions, but
no expansion of the color palette so far.  The current generation was
created in the labs as the AA chipset (for Advanced Amiga), but in some
countries it was later marketed as AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture).
Agnus was replaced by Alice and Denise by Lisa. The resolutions now reach up
to 1280x512 in VGA scan frequencies.  The color palette is now 24 bits or
16.8 million colors.  You can display up to 256 colors simultaneously or in
HAM mode more than 640,000.  Backwards compatibility with Video and OCS
modes is assured.
@{I}What is the Copper?@{UI}


Copper is the short name for a "Coprocessor" which is integrated into the
Amiga custom chips.  It makes fast action games possible, as well as
unbelievable color effects, and the capability to drag down a screen
partially on the Amiga's display and thus show several screens at once.
Technically, the Copper is a highly specialized microprocessor which knows
only three different commands, but can process these extremely fast and
efficiently.  It provides the ability to change, for instance, graphics
mode, color values, or sprite definitions somewhere at a well defined
location within the screen. This way the Amiga can display many different
actions on one screen simultaneously without activity by the main CPU.
@{I}What is the Blitter? @{UI}


Blitter is the short name for another graphics coprocessor which is part of
the Amiga custom chips.  With it you can copy rectangular image parts
extremely fast to other areas. During this, you can take up to three source
data areas and perform logical operations on them. This allows you, for
example, to define certain color values of the copied object as transparent,
thus not modifying the destination area. As an add-on, the Blitter can also
draw lines and fill areas quickly. All in all it serves to provide extremely
fast, animated graphics that can be designed to be especially realistic.
@{I}What is a sprite? @{UI}


A sprite is a graphical object that can be moved easily across the screen
and still be displayed without any flicker.  In game programs, they are used
to show projectiles or characters, which contributes to the blindingly fast
speed of typical Amiga action games.  Technically speaking, the sprite data
is held separately from the normal image data in memory.  A certain part of
the graphics hardware overlays this object at a selectable location onto the
background image.  Simply by changing one single memory value, the sprite
can be moved directly, without any delay, to a different location on screen.
The mouse pointer is one example of a sprite. The Amiga graphics hardware
provides for 8 sprites.

The HAM mode is one of several graphics modes that was provided by the Amiga
custom chips from the start. With HAM, you can display many colors
simultaneously while using up very little memory. Simply put, it's sort of a
hardware data compression method by a factor of three. Still you can display
practically all colors of the palette on screen.
@{I}How does HAM mode work? @{UI}


Technically it works like the name says: HAM = Hold And Modify.  Like other
graphics modes, you have a palette with base colors, so that for every pixel
you can store the number of its color in the video RAM. With the old HAM6
mode, these are 16 colors (4 bits per pixel); with the new HAM8 mode (since
the AGA chipset), these are 64 colors (6 bits per pixel). Now in the video
RAM two more bits of storage are provided, in addition to these 4 or 6 bits,
for every pixel. This yields six bits for HAM6 and eight bits for HAM8.

These additional two control bits can assume four different states: In one
state, the other bits give the number of a palette color like a normal
graphics mode. In the other three cases, one of the three color components
R, G, or B gets set to a new value from the other bits.  This way this color
component gets @{B}modified@{UB}, while the other color components remain
unaltered from the previous pixel, so they are @{B}held@{UB}.  This explains
the name HAM.
@{I}What are the strengths and limitations of HAM mode? @{UI}


This modification of one color component serves to render soft color
transitions very accurately, as they are typical for natural pictures like
portraits.  In the HAM8 mode you can theoretically display more than 640,000
colors simultaneously on screen. The dependence on previous pixel contents
sets certain limits, so that the HAM mode isless suited for realtime action.
But in still pictures or precalculatedanimations, it lives with its many
colors.  With its data compression,the HAM mode is also responsible for the
Amiga being so famous for itsanimations that can run at full speed, even on
smaller Amiga models.
@{I}How many colors can be displayed simultaneously in HAM8 mode?@{UI}


Basically you can display all 16.8 million colors of the 24-bit palette in
HAM8 mode. But there are two limitations: for one, no current monitor (or
screenmode) can display so many pixels simultaneously. In the screenmode
SuperHiRes PAL Interlaced, there are e.g. 640,000 pixels. Second, it's not
so easy to reach this color resolution with real-world pictures. Through the
normal HAM8 mechanism you can only set the upper six bits of each color
component red, green, and blue. Each component has 8 bit resolution so that
we get a total resolution of 3 * 8 or 24 bit. The lowest two bits are only
reachable through a special method, in that you have to choose the 64 base
colors appropriately so that they exactly cover all 64 possible combinations
of the lower two bits of all color components (3 * 2 bit = 6 bit, which
gives 64 combinations). But for real-world pictures, you want to use the HAM
mechanism to get smooth color transitions, so that the change to another
base color is not preferable.

To summarize, you can theoretically (and in very special applications like
demos) set practically every pixel on screen to a different color. But in
reality you are limited to an 18-bit color space (18-bit from 3 * 6 bit of
the HAM parts of the color components). In data sheets, you often find the
theoretical maximum value of about 640,000 colors (limited by the number of
pixels displayable on one screen).

The A600 Super Computer


@{I}A quick look at a remarkable product for the Amiga they said would never
be accelerated @{UI}

mailto: j.campbell72@genie.com"
@{U}                                                                           @{UU}



The A600 has always been known as the unexpandable Amiga; this is no longer
so. My good friend John Goodie (co-founder of the Cecil Amiga Users Group)
and I had been discussing for some time his upgrade options. I recommended
that he get an  A1200, but he wasn't quite ready to shell out the dough. So
he and I both began a small endeavor to find out what other options he had
for his A600. I searched on the Web and he began calling dealers. I found a
Web page that advertised an Apollo accelerator for the A600, so he notified
the dealer from which he had already ordered his 3.1 OS upgrade kit about
this accelerator. To make a long story short, the day after he received and
installed his 3.1 OS upgrade, he also received his Apollo accelerator. I was
privileged to be present and assist in the installation of this amazing
device.

Although adding the 3.1 OS to the A600 is an improvement, you don't really
reap the benefits until the accelerator is also added. John bought the
accelerator for his A600 from Software Hut for $189.00; it is a 25mhz 68020
with a 68882 math co-processor, and can house up to an 8mb SIMM memory
module. This gives his A600 a total of 10mb of memory: 2mb chip and 8mb fast
ram. This is more than he will probably ever need. The installation was
rather easy; the most difficult task was removing the metal shielding
because of the uncooperative tabs. Once the shielding is removed, it's a
breeze because the accelerator simply snaps over the top of the existing
68000 CPU, and it's a good snug fit. The only thing you must be sure of is
that you get a SIMM module that is petite, meaning one that the board on
which the actual memory chips are located is no larger than the chips
themselves. If you do not get a very small SIMM, the accelerator will not
fit.

The accelerator claims to increase the performance of the A600 7 to 8 times
and I believe it. After installing the Apollo in John's A600, I felt as
though I was sitting in front of my 40mhz A1200, no kidding. The only
problem we came across was whenever you interrupted the normal bootup such
as using the Amiga early startup control or using a pal boot disk the fast
ram was not recognized. I do not know if this was a problem with the simm or
with the Apollo; nevertheless it's a small price to pay for the increase in
performance. Overall I'd say the accelerator is well worth the money and if
I had to rate it between 1 to 10 I'd give it a 9. If you have an A600, get
it.

Amiga Music/MIDI: Some Current Options


@{I}More indispensable information from the resident Master of Amiga Music
and MIDI, Fred Ericksen @{UI}

mailto: f.ericksen@genie.com
@{U}                                                                           @{UU}



Hi everyone, and welcome to The Amiga Monitor issue #3! It's been one short
month since my last MIDI article, and for those of you who may have missed
the last one, I was giving short descriptions of some of the MIDI programs
I use. I started last month with sequencing programs Bars & Pipes, SuperJam,
Texture, Music-X, Master Tracks Pro, Deluxe Music Construction Set, and
inadvertently jumped to anotation program, Dr. T's "The Copyist DTP" (Desk
Top Publishing). Having recently purchased a copy of the CopyistDTP, I find
myself writing more about it than the other programs I've been using for
years. So.... here goes!

Dr. T's was one of the first programs I used with my Amiga, and 'tho I've
heard from many people who have tried it and did not like it, I find it's a
very powerful program even by today's standards. The last version that was
available to the Amiga, Dr. T's KCS (Keyboard Controlled Sequencer), came
bundled with a graphical editor called Tiger, a notation program called
Quickscore, a graphical mixing program called Automix, and an Algorithmic
composing program called LevelII. Although the Amiga provides a multitasking
environment, most programs are not able to share information without first
saving a file to disk, then loading it to the second or third program
running. Not true with Dr. T's. Dr.  T's utilizes a feature it calls MPE
(Multi Program Environment). This way you can load the above programs,
record sometracks, and instantly switch windows to edit the tracks without
saving/loading to disk. A very nice feature that seems to have been
implemented in just about every pro-style sequencing program available on
any platform is the Auto Mix feature. You can record multiple tracks, then
open the AutoMix window, select "Output to KCS" and record volume, Pan, or
_any_ MIDI control change information you'd like directly to a KCS track.
The Quickscore feature does leave one wanting more, although it does exactly
what it says. Record some tracks, switch to the Quickscore window, and look
at what you've recorded in standard notation. You can't edit from the
Quickscore window, but combined withsome global settings like Quantize,
Transpose, Key Signature etc. you get fairly good output that can be
printed. This is where The Copyist DTP comes in. This is the premier
notation program for the Amiga at this time. Like all Dr.T's stuff, it's a
little quirky at first, but I've found it to be a great program, especially
when writing music from scratch.  The Copyist has very few limitations like
so many other notation packages available.  Most notation programs set up in
either 12 staff or 18 staff per page, with 2 - 6 bars per staff per page. I
find this _very_ limiting. If you are writing a complete score, this makes
sense, but if you are writing for a single instrument per page, I like to
be able to have each line configureable.  If one measure has all sixteenth
notes, and the next a whole note or rest, the Copyist lets you set the bar
divider anywhere. This way the 16th notes can have a bigger area, and not
look so crowded. The Copyist has many other features, and you can bet I'll
be talking more about using this as well as the other programs in future
articles here in The Amiga Monitor. One program I also use quite often is
MidiQuest.  Again this is a program from a few years ago, and it's been
ported to the Mac and pee-cee machines. The Amiga version is no longer being
updated (the current ver is 4.0 I think), but it is the best synth editor
I've seen available for the Amiga. Unfortunately, the Amiga version won't do
samplers, but it has a lot of available drivers for most major brand
synths made. I use it mostly with my Roland CM64 as an editor/librarian. I
also use the librarian for my KorgPoly 800, Ensoniq KS32, Roland A-50
controller, and a few of my effects units. As far as samplers and
editor/librarians go, I've heard the Sample Wrench is a good program, but I
am unsure if it is still available to the Amiga platform. Perhaps some
readers can let me know if it is, and I'll pass the information on in a
future article. There are a few shareware programs I find _very_ useful
also, so I'll share a few thoughts on them. Having a few older synths can
haveits disadvantages, and some good points. I have a 12-bitsampler by
Roland called an S-10 . It does some good samples for 12 bit, but the real
problem lies in its diskdrive. It will only let you load 4 samples at a
time, and its disk drive is a 2.5 Quick Disk! These disks hold only one
sample equal to about 2 to 4 seconds per side depending on the sample rate.
When one side loads, you have to flip the disk over to load the other side.
Very archaic indeed! so, If I want to load 4 samples, I need 2 disks
inserted and loaded a total of 4 times. Also, the Quick disk is
_very_expensive. About $35.00 per box of 10. They have no sliding window,
only an opening that allows no protection to the exposed part of the disk. I
would think they would be much cheaper than manufacturing a 3.5 HD disk; go
figure. Anyway, I found a shareware program to solve my problems! The
program is called Sample Dump by Dieter Burns.  The archive that would be in
an online database is called MKS-100.lzh.  This program allows me to hook up
to the Amiga and load/dump direct to hard disk! Now I don't have to pay
$2.50per sample to store my sounds, no digging around for the right disk, no
flipping disks over and hitting the load button one more time :). There are
a _lot_ of cool shareware programs out there for many purposes. THANK YOU 
AMIGA COMMUNITY!

I've received a few letters from some readers, and I'd like to invite anyone
reading to go ahead and write, if only to say hello. One reader, Dhomas,
has some news I'd like to share.  Dhomas is currently writing an Amiga
Editor/Librarian himself, and is currently using itin his studio. I am
getting a copy to look it over, and perhaps I'll write a bit on it next
month, so stay tuned for a *NEW* Amiga thing! Here's a description of the
program he sent:

@{I}

Hi there Fred!

Read your Amiga Monitor article  (Sep96) and wanted to let you know about
our software: MIDI SYStem EXplorer.  It is currently on Aminet

If you haven't seen it yet have a look.  Or if you don't have access to
Aminet, email me and I'll send it to you. Here's some info:

young monkey studios
ANNOUNCEMENT: It has arrived... the long awaited MIDI SYStem EXplorer (MSE).
Due to an overwhelming amount of mailpushing for an earlier release of MSE,
we have decided tomake a pre-release version available.  If you have not
already done so, download mus/midi/MSE.lha from your favorite Aminet site.

ABOUT MSE---------Many, so called, UNIVERSAL PATCH EDITORShave come and gone
for the Amiga.  One of our biggest complaints, and the reason why we are
making MSE, is that these editors are not anywhere near UNIVERSAL.  The
approach others have taken is in requiring 'modules' to be purchased for
each MIDI device to be controlled.  This is fine as long as you can get a
module for EVERY device you have.  But we all know that, especially on the
Amiga, this has not ever happened.  Then of course, when the company goes
out of business or discontinues the program, no further modules are ever
made. So, along come a few other public domain and shareware authors to try
and fill in the hole. These programmers either chose to code individual
editors or make an another attempt at a UNIVERSAL EDITOR of their own. These
UNIVERSAL EDITORS require you to be able to program in C or Assembler in
order to make your own editors.  If you wanted to do that why would you
bother with their patch editor at all? Well, MIDI SYStem EXplorer has
arrived... we do not claim that MSE is a UNIVERSAL PATCH EDITOR...we are not
sure such a thing is even possible, but MSE does strive to solve a lot of
these problems:
1) Development of other programs stopped because nobody was buying it, and
   no editor exists for my new one of a kind MIDI ZEN-ZAMBULATOR.  MSE is
   being developed for our own studio use, first!  Even if nobody else wants
   to use it, we will continue to develop it.  Its development will
   continue regardless of whether anyone buys it or not.  We have been using
   our Amigas for over 10 years, and we do not see that stopping for a long
   time.  Even if we did stop developing MSE, you would very likely still be
   able to create new modules, because MSE already supports most MIDI
   formats.
2) You are a musician, you do not know how to program in C, or Assembler or
   any other language.  And if you did you would rather be composing than
   programming modules!  MSE supports modules created by the MSE-Compiler.
   It converts text definition files into modules that MSE can use.  The
   compiler uses an easy-to-learn language specifically written to be as
   easy to understand as possible.  In many cases, you can simply modify an
   existing definition file to work with another device.  If you can use a
   text editor and you understand X/Y coordinates you will likely learn
   MSE's definition language fast.  See the definitions  directory for
   samples of definition files.  Once you get a hang of things, making
   modules is FAST.  And once you have the editor done, you will be amazed
   at how much time is saved and how much more creative the process of sound
   generation becomes!  Definition files and modules will be freely
   available.  So, if you are not interested in making your own modules you
   can still use modules made by us and others.
3) Other editors do not work while my sequencer or other program is running.
   MSE will run in conjunction with programs that use the public domain
   MIDI.library or BlueRibbon.library.  MSE is also expected to support the
   Amiga CAMD.library once programming documentation is obtained (soon).
   Imagine being able to edit patch data while having that MIDI information
   recorded directly into a sequencer.  It is possible and opens up great
   creative possibilities.
4) Other software is too expensive!  We think so too. WHAT WILL MSE DO?-----
   MSE has been designed to control all types of MIDI data through a
   programmable graphic user interface or by external software control. MSE
   can be used as a simple MIDI Controller or a complex patch editing
   system. Some possible applications:

@{LINDENT 4}

*  MIDI Volume/Pan Mixer
*  Patch Editor
*  Patch Librarian.
@{LINDENT 0}
With the definition language you can design the entire user interface to
meet your needs.  Screen mode/size (Amiga/CyberGFX/etc.), window size and
position, fonts, borders, colors, gadget placement, etc. can all be
customized. As well, you can define the character set, MIDI port (Triple
Play Plus is supported) and much more.
Features:
@{LINDENT 4}

*  Extensive customization allows the user to design standard interfaces for
   all MIDIproducts connected to the system.
*  Graphic interfaces are designed external to the main program.  This
   minimizes memory requirements and increases the interface speed.
*  Just about everything is customizable, including: layout, fonts, gadgets,
    colors, images, menus, MIDI events, etc.
*  Allows the user to enter MIDI information from a device's user manual
   and configure a custom interface to access parameters.
*  Supports ALL MIDI events.
*  Patch/Librarian data is stored in MIDI standard format, for easy
   importing to other software.
   - Has the ability to edit individual parameters on devices that only
     support patch dumps.
*  MIDI communication can operate with realtime feedback and/or through user
   interaction.
*  Edits can be made without connection to a MIDI device, if required.
*  Includes lots of examples and common device interfaces, to get you
   started.
@{LINDENT 0}
WHAT WON'T MSE DO? 

Waveform editing (samplers) is  not supported.  Another program  WaveFormer
(under  development) is being designed for this.- Probably some  other
things too, but that first one was the most commonly  asked about.
THE FUTURE----------This is a pre-release  version and many features have
been disabled until they  are working properly and other features have yet
to be added. One of the most exciting features still to be added is ARexx
support. This will give ARexx programs complete control of MSE, allowing you
to program volume fades, alter patch data, generate random patches or
anything else you can imagine.  ARexx support has been planned from the
beginning and is already 80% implemented but has been disabled until the
module data format becomes more stable. There will be lots of other things
added in, making MSE even more useful. As always, we are happy to listen to
any suggestions you might have.
REQUIREMENTS:
@{LINDENT 4}

*  WB 2.x+
*  Text editor
*  MIDI interface
*  MIDI.library or Blue Ribbon.library (both included)
*  Understanding of MIDI documentation to create custom modules
@{LINDENT 0}
RECOMMENDATIONS:
@{LINDENT 4}

*  Simple paint program for layout design
*  WB 3.x

To Program an Amiga...

@{U}                                                                           @{UU}



Once in a while, in a past life, I would program computers.  Mostly for a
grade, but once in a while I would do it for fun.  Some folks collect high
technology toys as a hobby, I collect programming languages.  About the only
rule I have for learning/collecting languages is, it will never be COBOL.

Recently, Mr. Webb and I were discussing programming languages.  We
discussed the utility and currency of some languages.  This got me to
wondering what languages were and are available for the Amiga, and how close
to the "standards" these languages are.

My intention is to write a report on what programming languages are and were
available.  Mostly because I want to know, but why not share with you. This
won't be a report on what language is better than the rest, but merely to
show what is available, and what they can do.  If any of you can help me by
sending me the names of the producers of any of the packages, and their
e-mail addresses, snail-mail addresses, and any other pertinent information,
I can then report on that information to the rest of you.  I am particularly
interested in the obscure languages, but any help on any languages you can
offer would be appreciated.

Thanks for your help.

Amiga Organizers


@{I}Let your Amiga Organize your life, but not until after you've read this
comparison between two of the latest. @{UI}

@{U}                                                                           @{UU}




Everyone knows that their Amiga can play great games, be used to add titles
to their home videos, word process, ray trace, image process, web browse and
do a plethora of other things. Two commercial progams, "Nag" and
"Who, What, Where, When," were released long ago to hold your addresses and
appointments, but nowadays these are dated if you can even find them. Well,
thanks to PD and shareware the Amiga has two new organizers for you to
choose from. Both run under the latest OS and support all Amiga graphics
modes. So, without further ado I'll introduce you to Everyday Organizer and
Up To Date

@{I}@{B}Everyday Organizer V2.10 @{UB}@{UI}


This is the latest version of a freeware organizer for the Amiga. This
organizer comes in three parts. OnTime and Alarmist are designed to work
together to notify you both visually and verbally of your appointments while
Locate keeps track of your addresses and phone numbers.

@{B}Installation:@{UB} This is made easy by a thorough installation script
which either creates a new directory in the specified location or locates
thedirectory of an older version to write over it. Alarmist is placed in
your WBStartup drawer. As a commodity it sits in the background ready to,
for lack of a better term, alarm you. But more on that later.

@{B}Use:@{UB} Using Alarmist is easy. After installation you need just to
use Exchange to call up its interface from where you can enter single alarm
events and manage your other alarm events using the "new, Copy, Edit, Remove
and Toggle buttons. You then press the use or save button to send Alarmist
back into waiting with your events list, or cancel. To enter more advanced
scheduling information you will need to use On Time. This program opens a
calander on todays date. You simply click on the desired date, and use the
same group of buttons as in Alarmist to create or edit an Event, Task or
Note. Event types can be anything including TV shows, Birthdays,
Anniversaries (guystake note), Holidays, Appointments, Bills, or anything
else you need to keep track of. In the case of birthdays, Alarmist will
remind you of the special event whenever you turn on your Amiga that day.
This is because Alarmist checks On Times list on startup. Alarmists reminder
takes the form of both an on-screen pop-up and a verbal announcement using
the translator.library. Events have both a start and end date and a start
and end time, if applicable. Tasks only have start and end dates and Notes
have only a single date. The last part of Everyday Organizer is Locate, the
address book. Entering your addresses and phone numbers is easy using the
same well-defined buttons that permeate this software package. Once entered
you can either search by hand through the list or use the convenient search
field to find what you are looking for. You can also do this in On Time to
locate a specific schedule item. To protect your valuable information,
Locate allows you to password-protect your data files and, since the data is
saved as text, it also allows you to encrypt the datafile. Lastly, Locate
allows you to enter up to four separate phone numbers or Email addresses for
each person and will dial that number for you using your modem. Although
Locate is able to sense my modem, so far I have not been able to get this
feature to work. This brings us to:

@{B}Configuration:@{UB} Each of the three parts of Everyday organizer have
a button clearly marked config. This brings you to the configuration for
that specific program. For Locate you can specify encryption, data file to
load on startup, password and field names among other things. The
configuration of fieldnames is important since Locate is set up for European
addresses; some users like me have to make some slight modifications.
Alarmist's configurationallows you to change the titlebar clock, the hourly
chime, popup and snooze keys, and other preferences. On Time is so ready to
use I have never had to even use its configuration but it allows you to,
among other things, change the date format, search case sensitivity, and add
classes of events. Configuration of the interface of these three programs is
through MUI allowing all the flexibility of the MUI system through Everyday
Organizer.

@{I}@{B}Up To Date V2.0 Demo @{UB}@{UI}


Up To Date is a shareware package from Up To Date Solutions. Registering
will allow you to save your information as the demo has this feature
disabled. It does however, come with a sample to show you what data would
look like. You first must run the setup program to tell Up To Date what
screenmode to use. Then you are free to run the main program. Unlike
Everyday Organizer, Up To Date is just one program with a number of separate
modules.

@{B}Use:@{UB}When you run Up To Date, you are greeted with a titlebar clock
hovering over your Workbench. Pressing the right mouse button brings down
the main menu from which you can gain direct access to your time, week, and
appointment scheduling, addresses, a text editor, and the all-important
organizer itself. The managers and schedules allow you to input new events
or records and open up simple screens with text fields. The organizer greets
you with what looks just like an organizer you'd buy at the local stationary
store, including a personalized cover with your name. Pressing the tabs
brings you to the different sections, each with a calendar on the right hand
page and a list on the left. The tabs separate your appointments, tasks and
projects, anniversaries, and your week and month overviews.

The buttons under the organizer seem straight forward, but all might not be
as it seems. You would think that the "new" button would create a new event,
but this seems not to be the case. You create a new event by selecting the
day on the calendar then double-clicking with the left mouse button on the
list page. You are then greeted with the requester for giving the specifics
of the event. Graphically you can tell what days have schedule items because
they are marked with an X and can also be given a second graphic selected
from a menu.

The address book is not present in the organizer. It is a full screen of
fields for a complete business contact. Each phone number can be dialed by
pressing a button to the right of the number and a photo can be added to
each address entry as an IFF file. This address book can be linked to your
organizer, for what I don't really know. The entire program is hampered by
not having an English documentation file. Right now that is only available
in German. As far as the actual data file security is concerned, well, there
seems to be little. I see no way to password-protect your database though
the file is saved as a binary on the drive making it harder to read without
the program.

@{B}Installation:@{UB}Simply use the included installer script. It puts the
program and all support files in its own directory and the large
CanDo.Library in your Libs: drawer. That's right, I didn't tell you? Yea,
this program is made with CanDo.

@{B}Configuration:@{UB}Configuration of some of the features is through a
convenient setup program accessable through its own icon or through the
main menu. It's fairly self-explanatory.

Always the hardest part, so I'll start with the easy parts. Both are easy
to install and both make great address books. Here's where they divert.
Everyday Organizer is easier to use and more configurable than Up To Date
which is more comprehensive. Basically it boils down to this: if you are
looking for a place to keep your addresses and store some birthdays and
anniversaries, go with the free Everyday Organizer. If you are looking to
use your Amiga to help schedule business meetings and keep track of contacts
and business projects, spend the money and get Up To Date. Both packages are
very good and you get to try them both out for free simply by downloading
them from Aminet.

The Amiga Gaming Retrospective: Part 3 (Crystal Hammer)


@{I}The latest in this series; a look back to the great Arkanoid/Breakout
clone in a class of its own, Crystal Hammer. @{UI}

@{U}                                                                           @{UU}

@{I}Introduction @{UI}

Now before you say "Oh great, another Breakout clone," consider this: that
an original cannot truly be referred to as a "clone," that a classic stands
the test of time.

Not that Crystal Hammer was by any means the first game of its type;
Arkanoids and Breakout had certainly been around for some time. But in terms
of the Amiga, it was the first, or at least first fairly complete, game of
its type. And it is a classic. For its time, it was a game of remarkably
high caliber, sometimes even rivaling (with all due respect to the Mackey
brothers) MegaBall, today's high-end entry in that arena.

@{I}Description@{UI}

I'm sure I need not spend a large amount of time covering the fundamental
theory behind such a game; simply, you are given a paddle which you can
slide along the bottom of the screen, in an effort to keep a small ball
from going past. That ball, in turn, when in its element, goes around
knocking aimlessly into things and, ideally, destroying them for points.
There are generally a number of boards offering different configurations of
"bricks" (or "crystals" in this case).

All games of this type operate on this premise, and yet all of them (or at
least all the good ones) add their own unique twist to the formula. Crystal
Hammer is no exception to this.

When you first start the game (generally accomplished by booting from its
disk), you are presented with a screen that provides such information as who
programmed it (Guido Bartels), who did the effects, graphics, and sound,
etc., and then at the bottom "Hannover in November 1987." It also tells you
that you may continue your game if you accumulate 10,000 points.

Once the initial startup screen disappears (at which point the game has
finished loading), onto the screen pops a nicely-done graphical logo for
the game, which alternates periodically with the high score/initial list,
maintained during run-time only (in other words, full of GIB's when you
start up). A very well-done piece of music also plays during this interval
(remember, it WAS, after all, 1987).You can then start either a 1- or
2-player game via use of the left or right mouse buttons respectively (2
players simply take turns).

A player is given 4 extra lives to start with, represented by small versions
of your paddle in the lower left corner. The boards themselves (and there
are 30 of them) are colorful and varied, actually being a repeating sequence
of several backgrounds themselves composed of multiple tiled images (this
game is easy on memory). Everything is instantaneous, by the way, once the
game finishes loading; no waiting between boards, no pauses when beginning a
new game.

As already mentioned, the point of this game is to destroy the crystals
(there are several different colors), arranged over the background, and more
or less octagonal in shape. In the meantime, look out for "worms" that
emerge from the top of the screen and slowly make their way to the bottom.
You can destroy them with your ball or paddle, and they're worth a good
number of points, but they can unexpectedly deflect your ball, annoying if
it happens to be speeding along.

There are, of course, Power-Ups, in this case taking the form of falling
"pills" (basically rapidly spinning crystals). Only one may be falling at a
time. It should be noted that the white crystals never yield "pills;" the
others always will if one is not already present on the screen. Various
types of "pills" include the following:
@{LINDENT 4}

*  @{B}Red:@{UB} This turns your paddle into a gun of sorts so you can sit
                 there and blast away at will.
*  @{B}Orange:@{UB} An extra life!
*  @{B}Yellow:@{UB} Slows your ball down a notch. It can travel at several
                    speeds (slow, medium, and insane! plus a few more
                    intermediate ones).
*  @{B}Green:@{UB} Lets you catch the ball on the paddle and launch it with
                   a mouse click, rather than simply deflecting it.
*  @{B}Sky Blue:@{UB} Multiplier. Turns the 1 "hammer" (ball) into 3. Also
                      suspends further pills from falling until you lose 2
                      of the 3.
*  @{B}Royal Blue:@{UB} Extension. A wider paddle makes it easier to catch
                        the hammer...as well as a DEATH pill!
*  @{B}Pink:@{UB} Advancer. Takes you right to the next level, regardless of
                  your current circumstances.
*  @{B}White:@{UB} Er...you die. This is the "crystal suicide" aspect of the
                   game. Of course, it's possible to be forced into catching
                   one...and just TRY to differentiate between yellow and
                   white on an old monochrome monitor...!
@{LINDENT 0}


Each of these gives you points among different nice powerups. Yes, even the
white pill of death is good for points.

@{I}A Little History @{UI}

Being quite old, this game is naturally very hard to find. I haven't looked
in great depth online, but my source was an old disk. For me, this goes back
to my days of using my Uncle's A500 (thus the aforementioned monochrome
monitor), back in 1987 (goodness, how the years go by...). All I know is he
brought some disks over one night, saying "Sorry, no games this time," and
then the next day I learned the kind truth.

Being quite old, this game is also not very system-friendly. It's
unfortunate, and that alone is what first drew me to MegaBall last year (of
course, I've grown quite fond of that game as well now). Let's just say if
you have anything better than AmigaDOS 1.3, you're out of luck. Of course,
it takes over the machine and leaves no exit route (you can probably forget
the hard disk). Again, it's the MultiStart board that lets me even write
this review. I don't know if there's a patch to make Crystal Hammer more
system-friendly, but if you have this game, it's probably worth looking for.

Also considering the advanced age of Crystal Hammer, I officially ask you,
the Amiga community, if anybody either remembers this game, or has any
knowledge of the whereabouts of Guido Bartels, the author, and particularly
if he has ever done anything else for the Amiga. If we could gather some
information on this old game, it could prove quite interesting for a future
AM story. So the call goes out! Please let us know if you know anything
about this.

@{I}Conclusion@{UI}

I can say from personal experience that I've spent many an hour playing
Crystal Hammer. One truly remarkable aspect of it is that not only when it
was new, but also by today's standards, the gameplay is very smooth, the
graphics are good, and the sound effects truly sound like they belong there.

You may be able to find this game online somewhere, or maybe even in your
own disk collection if you go back to the earliest years of the Amiga. If
you do, another thing to look for is CHEdit (Crystal Hammer Editor) which
allows you to edit the boards. I have left my own distinctive touch upon my
own Crystal Hammer disk through use of that program.

Finally, I'd tell you about the ending of the game, but unfortunately, I
can't. I've never been able to finish the game! The furthest I've gotten is
somewhere in the high 20's, so board 30 continues to elude me. If I was
terribly curious, though, I could use CHEdit to rig it with no blocks on any
board in order to just breeze through. I suppose I'm still just holding out
hope to eventually get there, however. I'm beginning to suspect that, if I
ever do beat the game, my Amiga will morph into a 68060/AAA machine with
128mb 32-bit 60ns Fast RAM, 8mb Chip RAM, 64-bit SCSI-III interface,
Zorro IV bus, and Amiga OS 4.0 right before my eyes. Hey...you never know.

@{I}Workbench/Icon Deleting Problem @{UI}

I have a problem on my system I have yet to see mentioned by anyone in the
Amiga community. I have an A500 with 28 accelerator, 2.1 WB and 8mb fast
RAM.

When I shift-left-mouse-button click on more than one icon in an opened
window and choose to delete them, my system deletes ALL the icons in the
window, chosen or not. One can see how disastrous this could be! Deleting
one at a time is no problem. Any ideas?

Thanks for a fine start to The Monitor.

Anonymous@{B}

It sounds to me as if you have the icon for the window selected (e.g. if you
are working in the Workbench 2.1 disk window, you would have the disk icon
selected) when you select delete. The problem involves procedure.

When you're using multi-select, ALWAYS click on the first icon you want to
select BEFORE you press shift. That is to make sure that the previously
selected icon, such as the icon for the disk/drawer you have open, gets
deselected before you select anything. Have you been doing this?

@{I}A4000 Display Troubles @{UI}

I have an Amiga 4000/040, 2meg chip, 12 meg fast, RapidFire SCSI II with 440
meg seagate drive and ZIP disk attached, a SurpaFAX modem, laserjet III
printer, and 1401 multisync monitor. This system is parnetted to a CD-32.

My problem is the video output. About 2 days before my warranty was up
(Commodore was done by then) and no place to get it fixed my 4000 started
getting vertical lines on the screen.  These vertical lines are still there,
but the video is getting worse.

The mouse pointer flickers left/right sometimes as much as 1.4 inch. This
makes it very hard to click on small buttons and sliders.  The screen colors
flicker between light gray (MWB colors) and light blue/purple.  AGA screens
show fringing of colors.

I am going to take my multi-sync monitor to a friend's house this week to
try it on his 4000.  I have tried my 4000 with a 1084S with the same
results. I find that if I run two different screens, I can pull the front
screen down a little and the situation isn't quite as bad. The mouse pointer
still flickers left/right though.

The problem occurs consistently.  Sometimes it isn't quite as bad as others.
The vertical lines (1/2 inch apart, approximately 3 points wide) are always
there.

Sometimes icons are ghosted in opposite colors. I would help with this
problem and the name and number of a reputable Amiga person that can fix
this problem. I live in western Pennsylvania, approximately 25 miles
northwest of Pittsburgh. I tried calling the one remaining Amiga (??) dealer
in the area and they told me there is no guarantee the Amiga can fixed. They
gave me an excuse about the motherboard being multi-layered and I may just
want to trash this system and buy something else (they also sell PCs :( ).

David F. James
Member: Team Amiga@{B}

That sounds like quite a problem you have there, Dave. I can't give you an
absolute answer, but I can suggest several possible explanations.

Until you mentioned that you had tried the 1084S, I was going to suggest the
monitor was a problem; but testing it on another machine should prove
conclusive enough. Another possible issue is heat. The strangest problems
can sometimes be caused by too much heat buildup inside a computer, and
built-in cooling fans may not do the job. For one thing, I would check to
make sure that your fan(s) do, in fact, work, and that the computer is in a
fairly open area (enough for air to circulate). However, heat being the
culprit is unlikely, considering that you say the problem is consistent.

One thing that comes to mind, and is probably the most likely conclusion, is
that you have a chipset problem. Your AGA video chip (or any of them, for
that matter) may have developed a problem, or been faulty to begin with
(such problems do not always appear immediately). If it's at all possible, I
would suggest replacing the Lisa chip. I don't know if the A4000 has
surface-mounted custom chips, but regardless, you can still replace them;
desoldering a surface-mount chip is easy for anybody experienced in
electronics work.

Lastly, not being an electronics expert, I can't comment on the A4000
motherboard issue the technicians cited, but I can tell you that as long as
a grenade hasn't gone off inside of it, your Amiga can be fixed. This is
especially so if you only have one bad microchip (which may or may not be
true).

I would explore these various options; I suspect they might lead you to a
solution.

If any of you readers out there have any ideas I haven't mentioned,
particularly if you are experienced in this line of work and are familiar
with this sort of problem, feel free to send them to The Amiga Monitor.

@{I}Connecting Amiga to WWW @{UI}

HOW DO YOU DO IT, Please send me step by step info on how to connect my
Amiga 4000 with a Toaster by New Tek to the WWW. Do I use Winsock or what
do I use? How much RAM do I need and what kind of modem will work? How do I
get a TC/IP address? These questions are real. I am contacting you from a
Macintosh at Seattle University but own the Amiga at home. What browser do I
use? Can I use Netscape or only Mosaic? Also how do I create firewall
protection so if, after connecting to the WWW and attempting to download
something, I won't get a virus in my computer that will destroy my hard
drive or Amiga system? Thank you for the information---no one else on the
internet has been willing to answer these questions. Even after paying for a
tutorial on it from a professor in Berkeley, he said he had no idea how to
connect an Amiga to the WWW.

Karen Ludwig@{B}

Okay, I'll try to break this down into pieces for you. It's a very complex
issue, and fortunately, thanks to the many dedicated Amiga programmers out
there, you have a number of options. I'm going to name a number of pieces of
software, and unless otherwise noted, you *should* be able to find any of
them on Aminet, or a similar Amiga archive.

Connecting an Amiga to the WWW is fundamentally the same as doing so with a
PC or Mac, but the steps required to do so are different, and in some ways
more difficult (although this is changing gradually).

I'm simply going to give you an overview, but for more information, I would
recommend that you contact IAM at phone number 1-610-853-4406 and order
Dale L. Larson's "Connect Your Amiga!" book. It is a very well-done,
in-depth description of the steps necessary. But what I tell you here
should help you get started.

The first thing you need for accessing the WWW is an internet (probably
SLIP) connection; this, in turn, requires an Internet Service Provider (very
easy to find these days...consult a phone book), or Online Service such as
CompuServe or America Online (although if you are strictly a Netizen
[Internet user], you would be better off avoiding the latter two...they
charge a lot for time spent online, which may be arguable to be worth it if
you take into account the many non-internet services they offer; but a
decent ISP will only charge you a flat rate). The university itself might
allow you to dial up from home; I would recommend that you ask a system
administrator about that, since it could save you the trouble of joining
another ISP.

Once you have an account at some place that provides dialup internet access
(make sure you have a modem that's 14.4kbaud or faster, or you'll be doing a
lot of waiting), you need to set up a TCP stack. TCP/IP is the language of
the internet; it's the protocol that remote computers use to transfer
information in a structured, coherent manner between each other. There are
several ways to do this on the Amiga: the old way, and the way we all had to
do it before things got easy, was to download AmiTCP, and go through the
painful steps needed to set it up (unless you got a setup script to work, in
which case you were left with a very jury-rigged...but working...setup). But
today, you have options. First, there's the commercial program Termite TCP
from Oregon Research, which is supposedly extremely easy to set up. You
might, however, want to try the brand new shareware offering Miami, which,
although I can't speak from personal experience, should be very easy to set
up and use.

Okay, so now we're going to assume you have your internet account, SLIP
connection, and TCP stack set up properly, or at least ready to become so.
From there on out, it's very easy. You simply need applications to use the
TCP stack. Often one of the most significant of these, and which you
mentioned, is the web browser. There are several options available for Amiga
users; AMosaic, AWeb, Voyager, and IBrowse. No, unfortunately, Netscape is
not among the browsers available to Amiga users...but you really aren't
missing anything. IBrowse supports all the features, and in my humble
opinion, is better, in fact, than Netscape. You can download the latest demo
of IBrowse at http://www.omnipresence.com. It's fairly easy to set up and
use. But make sure you have MUI! This is available just about anywhere, and
is, fortunately easy to set up and use. MANY Amiga internet programs use
MUI. If you haven't heard of it, it's a GUI enhancement/programmer's tool
system.

Now would be a good time to discuss memory. Even if you A4000 has the
standard 6MB, you should be home free. Amiga internet software does take up
a good chunk of memory, so the things to watch out for are people with
unexpanded A500's hoping to use the internet (that is, through a SLIP
connection, not a Shell account). It just can't be done the way things are
now (sorry folks); but with your high-end A4000, you should have no problem.
Just don't be surprised if you have Miami, MUI, and IBrowse all running at
the same time, and you notice yourself a bit short on memory. They ARE
memory-intensive; but 6MB is enough.

Let's see...I go back to view your question some more, and I see you're
inquiring about modems. Well, as I said, 14,400 baud is the minimum
reasonable speed for WWW browsing. I would really recommend 28,800, which is
now mainstream, and you might even go so far as to get a 33,600 baud modem,
which really isn't even supported very much...YET. Right now, 28,800 is the
way to go. There are other technologies developing at this time that bypass
the analogue phone lines completely, such as ISDN lines and Cable Modems...
but to be honest, I really don't know just how much you can do with one of
these and an Amiga. If your Amiga were on an EtherNet network, you might
have another option. But it's all very confusing, and best avoided by a
beginner. A 28,800 modem, and a decent ISP (Internet Service Provider),
should serve you well.

Protection is a key. The best protection is to check all software that you
download with a virus checker, preferably one that can scan "inside" LhA
files. I would recommend Virus Checker by John Veldthuis, which has been
coming along for a while now, and can sit nice and resident within your
system checking everything as it passes by. Although caution is imperative,
take comfort in the Amiga's obscurity; it corresponds to a relatively small
range of viruses. BUT DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING! There ARE viruses out there.
Protect yourself and you shall prosper.

I think that just about covers it for now, based on what you said. Remember,
unless otherwise noted, all the software I indicated within this description
should be available on Aminet (http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/aminet). To get
them on your Amiga, you're going to have to put all files on a PC-formatted
disk, which either a PC or a Mac should be able to do, and then use CrossDOS
back on the Amiga to read them.

If all goes well, you should be on the internet with the Amiga with a
minimum of effort. But even if there are problems, stick with it...the
results are well worth it.

@{I}Amiga OS Tips and Tricks @{UI}


Just a quick comment about your article in The Amiga Monitor: you said
"rename" has the disadvantage of not working across devices. You didn't
mention the very big advantage - that it only changes the name and you don't
have to wait for the whole file to be copied, and that if you're moving a
file on a floppy disk, then there may not be enough room to copy it and then
delete it.

Fergal Daly@{B}

True, very true. That is a very notable advantage of the "Rename" command.
So, dear readers, you may supplement my original report (see "Mike Webb's
investigation of AmigaDOS" from the September 1996 issue) with this
information. Thanks for pointing that out, Fergal.

@{I}Amiga - Digging for gold and finding nothing yet! @{UI}


In reply to Robin L Clifford's letter published in issue 2 of AM, I think
several people are missing the point (most of the Amiga world are missing
the point). Providing the low-end Amiga systems with a processor that
operates like grease lightning will not help! For the last five years the
Amiga's problem has been the design of its custom hardware - it is just not
good enough!

The Amiga works in a totally different way to most other architectures.
Firstly, it has two independent buses - Chip and Fast. The trouble is that
the CPU (any CPU - even a 300Mhz DEC Alpha if you could use one) has the
lowest CHIP RAM acceess priority of all major system silicon, because if the
display hardware could not get access to the Chip RAM bus, you would not
have a display. Add to this that the display hardware is totally planar in
design (forget the rubbish about using the copper), which means that for an
8bit display, LISA (I'm talking AA here) has to perform eight memory fetches
for every 32 pixels (the same as an 8bit PC display). However, due to 8bit
PC displays being CHUNKY, it is possible for the memory access to be
pipelined. LISA on the other hand has to change her address eight times per
32 pixels. This in itself doesn't prove to be problematic (even with high
resolution) until you also realize that the BLITTER, COPPER, PAULA, DISK,
SERIAL_PORT, etc. hardware are all fighting to get on the same bus - if you
have not got any Fast RAM you are in real trouble. 

Michael Webb states that the ECS is "more of a limitation on performance
than the '030", and I agree, but I also hate to shatter everyone's dreams -
so is AA. You cannot expect games like DOOM (Amiga clones are a joke!) when
it takes eight Chip RAM accesses to write 32 pixels (plus a ridiculous
amount of processing in the registers - setting single bits isn't very
efficient). OK! You can do it much faster when you hold a chunky buffer in
fast RAM, and then convert the whole thing, but it is still much slower than
if you had a real chunky display. What I am trying to say is that having a
processor running at 1 BIPS would not make a huge difference - especially
when the speed of Chip RAM bus is linked directly to the colour clock!
PeeCees will always be faster, and will keep on getting faster. Why do you
think anyone who uses his A4000 for serious reasons also has a huge 64bit
graphics card taking up a fifth of its innards? It is not because he likes
16 Million colours on his Workbench, it is because it provides SPEED.

What the Amiga really needs is a complete revision of its chip set! However,
this is not a realistic proposition, as the cost of developing such a chip
set would be far too high. There are people that advocate the selling of
such chips as a high end graphics cards for PC's, but that market is already
dominated by large corporations with huge budgets and very successful (very
cheap) products. No! The Amiga must move on. I advocate that the whole
graphics and sound system should be made retargetable, with the user
selecting the appropriate hardware drivers as they currently do with
printers. There are many video and audio hardware manufacturers that can
make silicon of a far superior quality (using AAA is a joke) and a much
cheaper price than any Amiga company could do, that the Amiga must forget
its past. In 1996 there is no need to "bash the metal" (no matter how much I
like programming the Amiga hardware!). What the Amiga needs is a scalable
PCI architecture (for the whole range), PPC of various performance accross
the range, and a significant update to the OS design whilst keeping the
Amiga ideal intact. All machines should have audio-video functions performed
on separate daughter-boards (with their own memory - preferably VRAM for the
high-end machines). High end machines should use very high end graphics
(possibly Silicon Graphics) and sound hardware (many to choose from), with
the home machines using similar hardware to current multimedia PC's. High
end machines should also include the current architecture on a separate
daughter-board.

Obviously the high end machines should be released as soon as possible, and
sold in parallel with the current A1200 (sold with 4Mb Fast RAM, and 50Mhz
68030). The whole range should then develop over a period of two to four
years (I'm being realistic *), with the high end architecture migrating down
through a mid-range machine, and eventually to the low end. This would allow
software suppliers to migrate their products to the new architecture, and
provide the low end versions of the new architecture with a ready built
library of software. Obviously, the high end machines MUST keep pace with PC
technology over that time scale.
@{LINDENT 4}

*  Realistic is hard to judge - It is realistic from a hardware point of
view (not too expensive), but quite stupid from a software point of view:
there would be no software houses supporting the machine by that time;
nobody would therefore buy the machine; and there would be no one making the
machine. It's a tricky situation!!!

Martin Cordingley (An Englishman in Germany).@{B}

Well, where shall I begin...

The Amiga has always had the custom chipset and bus design, as well as
planar screenmodes, and it's just a bit odd that people have only begun to
question them recently...but more on that later.

Your point stands that the current line of Amigas are performance-deficient,
and you begin to hint at the idea that there are a number of reasons for
that, but I think some of those ideas (and don't get me wrong; a definite
portion of the Amiga community has been adopting these) are
counterproductive at best.

For one thing: yes, we DO need faster processors. I reiterate what I said
last month: we have to keep everything within reason if we want to have a
chance of surviving. And from a technical standpoint, the 680x0 series still
has plenty of life in it. That is, a 50mHz 68030 for the low range, and the
66mHz 68060 for the high end. I also reemphasize that it would be a mistake
to divide the mainstream line among two processor families.

Now, the chipset is turning into a very heated, controversial issue these
days. Let's just establish right off that the reason the Amiga has been so
successful as a multimedia computer over the years is that it has had that
efficient bus built in, including the custom chipset, which has
@{I}always @{UI}been a powerful and modular coprocessing subsystem. If you
compare it to PC's, in which the entire platform has been crippled by a
fundamentally poor software AND hardware design architecture that has been
built, and continues to stand in part atop the flimsy foundation of the
MS-DOS days, you see the incredible brilliance of the Amiga's design. Even
though it IS dated. Let's just say a haphazard design would NOT have lasted
over a decade despite corporate incompetence.

The Amiga has always had planar screenmodes, and there are perfectly good
reasons for having them, particularly notable being use with video devices,
one of THE reasons the Amiga achieved any level of success. But it is clear
that it needs chunky pixel screenmodes.

If you are hanging from a cliff by precious few threads, you don't cut one
of them. Similarly, eliminating the current Amiga design architecture in
favor of, essentially, 3rd party graphics and sound boards would be the
quickest road to technological suicide. Again, one of the Amiga's greatest
strengths has always been the custom bus and chipset design. It needs to be
improved, not killed off! Not only would switching to a generic PC
architecture create more incompatibilities than you could dream of, but it
would also accomplish next to nothing.

As far as I am concerned, people who cite cost as a reason for dumping the
custom chipset are those who have truly missed the point. The Amiga was an
inexpensive computer from day one, often selling for far less than an
IBM-PC, and Commodore continued that trend up until their very end. It was
only later, when ESCOM took over, that prices truly got out of hand. The
custom chipset is NOT a price concern. To say it is is to point the finger
out of desperation.

You say that "using AAA is a joke" without offering any support for that
supposition. AAA is, incidentally, the next step; it is FAR ahead of AGA,
and on a par with nearly any 3rd party board available for the Amiga today.
It's also almost complete! Without going into all the technical details,
the AAA chipset would significantly increase the bandwidth, speed,
efficiency, and overall performance of the chipset. And yes, it WOULD add
chunky pixel graphics modes, which would single-handedly solve many of the
performance problems associated with the custom chipset now. In conjunction
with all of this, it also has the nice side benefit of being
backwards-compatible with existing Amiga technology. Furthermore, dare I say
it...regardless of the technical merits of the AAA chipset OR something
else, the AAA chipset would be the fastest way to get new Amigas with
*significantly* enhanced capabilities on the market (and then give time and
resources to develop a successor to AAA, as has been the progression for
every chipset since the first). And if we want to have ANY chance of
surviving as a platform..."soon" is the operative word.

So yes, blaming the Amiga's microprocessor for it's current problems is
somewhat shallow...but so is blaming the custom chipset.

@{I}Out of touch users?@{UI}


Users seem to be in the habit of mailing wishlists these days. 'I don't want
a 030 in the lowend Amiga...' or 'The PowerPC should be able to run
windows...' etc. Hmm...I think that TALKING about it is a big waste of time
since no one listens. I've been with Amiga since day-one and believe me,
they never listen.

Now for some ArmChair quarterbacking of my own...I think the PowerPC plan is
a dumb idea.Yeh, I know RISC is the future and all that, BUT:
@{LINDENT 4}

*  A PowerPC machine costs about $5000
*  PowerPC is totally ignored by its Co-Developer, IBM
@{LINDENT 0}


Keep that in mind! When the first Amigas came out C= opted for 68000 because
it was 16-bit, but by getting this we don't improve on Intel at all in
performance!

I think the only viable idea to do right now is to port the thing to 586
code and run it on a Intel motherboard. A top of the notch PC costs 1500$
these days. Cheap! If it wasn't for thecrummy Windows it would even be
usable. By doing this Amiga would at least have a safe future hardware-wise,
not to mention the big bust in mHz! But then again , I can trust VIScorp/AT
to make the wrong move again...

Ariel Magnum
Tel Aviv, Israel@{B}

I tend to believe that speaking your mind is the least people can do to
enact change, but that's beside the point.

I agree with you that the PPC isn't a good choice now, but from there we
diverge. Now, granted, PPC's are a bit pricey, but I think that $5000 mark
was a bit overexaggerated, considering that Macintoshes generally don't cost
anywhere near that much.

"Commodore" (we're actually dealing with the original Amiga Inc. here)
decided to use the 68000 for a number of reasons: better architecture, far
more coherent register-programmability, and the fact that it was 16/32-bit
didn't hurt. In addition to that, it was faster than the offering from Intel
at the time. Believe it or not, 680x0's have kept up with 80x86's, for the
most part, until only recently when Motorola basically ceased development of
the line. For instance, a 68020 or 68030 could compare to a 80486, a 68040
to a high-end 80486 or low-end Pentium, and more recently, a 68060 stacks up
nicely against a midrange pentium (and nobody's even clock-doubled it yet).
By switching to the 80x86 line, which itself might be dying (at least as we
know it) at the hands of RISC development, we would gain nothing at this
time besides making the Amiga a more generic PC-flavored box.

Lastly, it's lamentable that our experiences with Amiga companies over the
years have had the potential to foster such cynicism, but it's difficult to
not take on a pessimistic view considering what we've been through. Maybe
the future will be better; we can only hope, wait, and see...

@{I}Motorola@{UI}


A few points (long points ...):

Motorola's largest 68k series customers have always been industries other
than computer manufacturers.  Motorola 68000, 020, 030, 040's are found in
printers, robots, cars ... heck, your microwave may even have a 68000  -- I
know my printer has an 020!  Macs and Amigas made up a significant share of
68k chips, but they were not the entire market.  Motorola are not even
trying to market the 060 as a CPU as such but as a controller chip for
industrial uses.  I cannot remember the term used, but they are not talking
about it in terms of desktop computers.

As an owner of an A3000 with an 060 and a graphics card (CV640) with
Cybergraphx, I have learned the hard way that AGA-like hardware standards
have to go.  You talk of future machines needing chunky-pixel and of gaining
back the edge once held in graphics.  One way is to embrace Cybergraphx --
the only RTG pretender out there in any numbers.  I have a machine which
can play some of the most advanced texture-mapped games out there, playing
through Mac-emulation on Shapeshifter, but I cannot run The Killing Grounds
AB3D II.  I can drag windows with 8-24 bit pictures as a background for the
windows (with a different 8-24 bit background on Workbench) as a solid
window, resizing the window as a solid as well (I don't know the technical
term for the real-time resizing).  What does this mean?  Well, my machine at
work is a P-100 running Windows NT and a 64 bit graphics card.  It can also
move windows around in solid view and resize as a solid window, but you can
forget backdrops of any sort if you want the display to be smooth and the
machine functions not to grind to a halt.  Why?  Because the OS gets in the
way.  The Amiga still has its 'graphics' advantage and many others too once
a faster graphics and central processor are added.  An 060-based Amiga runs
Mac software roughly as fast as a 9500 - 100 based PPC Mac, (excluding FPU).

Not as much has to change for the Amiga as some may think.  Phase 5 has the
right idea by making the first multi-processor Amiga with their 060/PPC
tandem boards.  Imagine -- the OS and smaller apps running from the 060
while the PPC answers the calls from ImageFX, Shapeshifter, LightWave,
AlienBreed 3D IV :)  Now there is a computer to drool over, no?  My Amiga
has cost me many dollars, maybe around $3000 -- that includes a CV64,
060/50, a 3000 (used), and 32 megs of ram and a lot of great software.
Even with its dated OS, my Amiga outclasses machines that I could have
purchased new at that price.  Maybe not in raw MIP speed of such and such a
test, but in every day real use in programming C++, making Web pages and
graphics, running rendering, and writing letters.  Whether the Amiga goes
bust in the end or not, it really does not matter.  I still have a great
machine that can do fantastic work.

It is not about beating Wintel (good luck!) or becoming number one in
everyone's minds, it is about surviving and being able to enjoy the computer
of your choice for years to come ... and I stress choice.  I don't want to
have to choose from IBM's Wintel or Compaq's Wintel.  I don't call that
choice.  I want to have an alternative that is right for me.  Macs are
great, but I like more control and power, not to mention multi-tasking.
Maybe I should go get a Be computer?  They sound great and maybe in a few
years I will get one, but it is no Amiga.  It has an Up-to-date OS alright
-- it takes at least 8 megs to start the system up!  Yes, yes, I know, it
has many great OS features and lots of risc cpus which require this ram. 
When Be releases a home-user based 1990's 'Amiga 500' equilvalent, then
they can call themselves the spiritual successor to the Amiga.  I am all for
making big-box Amigas, but I for one would like to remember when I saved all
the money I could and went out and bought an A500 in '86/87.  I think it was
$400 and it was not a main-stream computer at that time either.  I highly
doubt the average 15 year old today can afford a $1500 base computer.  Sure,
the kid could buy a used 386/486 for a little more than I paid for my 500,
but would he get the same level of equivalent power that I had at the time?
How about the pride in being able to buy a first computer? No, I am one of
the first to say to Be, "great, another choice in computing!"  Be developers
and Mac users also talk of beating Wintel, and 'winning.'  Beating Wintel is
not going to happen ... not in this century :)  The focus of the Amiga
should be survival -- not teetering-on-the-edge survival which has been
going on for far too long, but a healthy, strengths-in-certain-markets kind
of survival (including the home market). I want the Amiga to have a healthy
market share and receive some respect as a great computer platform, but
main-stream?  I think not.

It's always interesting to see how microprocessors are being used as simple
controller chips in various domestic or industrial applications other than
personal computers. Especially since, in many cases, the older chips that we
once regarded as so cutting-edge are now being used, and some manufacturers
are just beginning to get beyond the old 8-bit Z80's and 6502's and moving
on to the 16- or 32-bit units we've been using in our Amigas all these
years.

I won't repeat what I said earlier on this page, beyond saying that yes, AGA
itself might be dated, but the logical progression would be to the next
level of the chipset, that being AAA. But I won't get into that any more at
this time, other than to say that CyberGraphx is a very good piece of
software, and that the Amiga would do best with something like it built into
the OS...something that can address the custom chipset as well as a
graphics/video board. That would be versatile. But, fortunately, the OS is
very modular (object-oriented for those buzzword-inclined) and easily
supports and integrates such extensions.

You make a lot of good points in your letter, however, so leaving well
enough alone, I'll let you speak for yourself without any further comment on
my part. It nicely embodies the philosophy by which we are endeavoring to
succeed in some way.

Well said. I also remind you and the rest of the community to keep the
faith, and remember that as long as we have a reason for doing what we're
doing, it's not over. And who knows, we may actually have a renewed reason
sometime soon.

@{I}Copy of Letter to Phase 5 Regarding CyberVision Support @{UI}


@{B}@{I}Editor's Note: The following is a letter that a reader wrote to
Softwood regarding Phase 5 products (it has intentionally been left
unedited). @{UI}@{UB}

@{I}

Hello,

My name is Andrew Gordon, I am writing from Sydney,Australia as a purchaser
of a Cybervision 64 card + Cyberstorm 060 (still awaitingCyberstorm 060)
from Anahiem, California based Amiga dealer TransdataIntl.
(Cybervision $600,Cstorm $1000)

A little history on myself as an Amiga user for over 10yrs:my current system
is one of the A4000Ts made by the now defunct AmigaTechnologies, purchased
only in April '96 after a 3 year break from computing.(my 4000T is fitted out
with 16megs ram,quad scsi cdrom at a costof U.S. $4300).

I felt I needed to write directly to Phase 5 Germany, but found they  have
no email access on their web page. So I figured I would write to you as my
boards were sourced from the U.S.

My concerns surround my visit to Phase 5's German page and reading about the
new Cybervision 64/3D update. I ordered my Cybervision board in May on a
trip to L.A. only to recieve it this week after it arrived at Transdata from
you.

I am very dissapointed to find I have an instantly obsolete board and to see
Phase 5 trying to suggest an extortionate trade-in fee for existing owners,
crying that the makers of the Trio64, S3 chip have dropped supportof the old
MPEG expansion option.

As one of many Amiga owner really struggling to justify pricy expansion,
which is fast slipping behind PC machines, I am left feeling very cold to
third party hardware makers.My chief point of reference has been me having
a technician whom works for my company here in Australia build me a
Pentium 100 based PC as an interim home computer/eventual work computer. I
had some components from a laptop I once owned, such as a ext. 4x cdrom
drive,keyboard,and mouse, as well as my 4000Ts 17" multisync. With these
parts I asked mytechnician (a skilled PC Builder) to build me a PC with
16megs (U.S.$120),1.02 gig HD(U.S. $210),a S3 Trio32/64 based 2meg video
card (U.S.$140),Soundblaster pro compat. audio (U.S.$100),motherboard +
pent 100(U.S. $400). This is my second day using thisPC (I have been using
other PCs at work and with friends, particularlyhelping install internet
browers and enjoying them) and already have it running in 16-bit color at
1024x768 mode in Win95. Quite frankly I am finding it difficult to knock its
performance and ease use.

In this kind of battle were does a formly anti-msdos/Win3.11 Amiga lover
stand?

By comparision I have had dramas akin to the bad old days of PCs with my
4000T, such as no Hi density disk drive (my biggest gripe yet),next to
impossible, user-unfriendly internet software(I still do not haveit
running), a general lack of decent applications.

To add insult to injury, upon obtaining a rare Hi-density floppy I struck
a still unexplanable compatiblity problem, so I sent the drive back to the
U.S. supplier(no drives have been available in Aust for 6mths.).Because I
Knew the drive would not neccessarily be returned quickly (I had burned it
out through frustration), I decided to try other U.S. suppliers and after
many days found that Visionsoft in Carmel, C.A. had the U.K. PowerComputing
adapted 1.76m drives.After the drive arrived I Still had compatibily problem
(the drive could not be controlled).After speaking withmy Sydney Amiga
supplier, I spoke with the Amiga Importers,then Australian Power Computing
Importers (neither had tried a 1.76 drive of any sort witha '96 4000T),and
finally a Sydney based Amiga dealer/technician recommended by several
dealers.

After phone conversions with the aforementioned repairer, I carted my
machine to this incredibly difficult to find, small backyard-ish operator.

This brings me to my current position, 3 weeks later, no computer although
the Hi-density problem is supposedly fixed (the stubborn diehard Amiga
technician insists he wants to get both the original 880k floppy and the
1.76k one are work, inconsequential to me!).

After this epic can you honestly say you would stand by a platform which
has given you so many dramas?

On top of that can you imagine paying seeming ludicrous money for expansion
hardware- $2000+ ,for an outdated video card,accellerator board, and
emplant emulator.(In reflection, a momentary lapse in sanity it would seem)

As I write this letter I feel more and more let down by my Amiga and
hardware makers, really how could I not? Not even the Video Toaster has
remained a shining example of Amiga only brilliance!other examples are too
numerous as I'm sure you know.(Gone it would seemare the days of Amiga
graphics and OS power and superiority) Of course If was an Amiga
hardware/software company, I too would want to find security in other
platforms.

If Phase 5 could present a third party perspective of a shining white hope
for Amiga to get ahead of the rest once again,I, along with many other
Amiga users may be able relight the fires of past. So far I have only read
of possibilties and vague news bits in the press.Will it be Power PC as
long lauded or now maybe HP RISC?.Who could be bother waiting!

To sum it It seems all too hard for even an Amiga devotee to put up with.
To other computer users I know well, having an Amiga is like living on and
esert island surround by sharks!Not to mention finding it nearly impossible
to defend the cost when dicussing platforms with Mac and PCusers.

Sorry to have expanded on my situation to the nth degree, but I feel it was
the only way to fully explain my frustration in owning an increasingly
difficult to justify computer that's so new.

Sincerely,
A. Gordon

Update - 5 Sept., Still no Amiga,no response from Softwood,No Cyberstorm. A
faultless PC Now with an extra 32megs ram (only US$200) or 48megstotal-my 
quest for ultra-high memory happening this quickly and cheaply!Tommorow a
Matrox Millenium 2mb video card (real 2D+3D processing power for US$280).
Also who needs the flooded,difficult to wade through Aminet archive,when
you can easy and simply access  the Windows 95.com archive full of Microsoft
approved freeware and shareware.I feel my Amiga's ultimatum is nearing, who
can afford to keep such an expensive machine, that seems like its
devaluating by the second!

Regards,
A. Gordon@{B}

I hate to end this column for the month on such a negative note, but there
are several good reasons for printing this letter.
@{LINDENT 4}

*  It documents interaction between an Amiga user and one or more major
   Amiga companies these days.
*  It gives the point of view of somebody not living in the country in which
   the companies in question are based.
*  It illustrates the frustration many Amiga users are facing these days.
*  And, finally, it makes you wonder what has kept this platform going for
   so long.

I personally don't believe everybody has experienced the problems Mr. Gordon
has, or else we never would have owned Amigas for very long. But the
comparison between the Amiga and the PC truly exemplifies our modern-day
quandary:

How can we go on when there are such problems facing us? That is, if the
Amiga's technology is aging, and PC's continue to progress?

I'll let the letter tell the story. But personally, I feel that this
condition is not a terminal disease. That we can get beyond it. That we can
excel!

But success is more than the letters that comprise it. It's dedication and
hard work. And to whom do we owe the duty of this work?

Why, ourselves. Yes, we, the Amiga community...and the myriad companies
involved. The integrity that has kept us as one for so long much continue.

Devaluing by the second? A dire prediction, indeed...but possibly one with
the potential to come true.

We're at that stage when either pure success or total failure is imminent.
But either way, it's going to be quite a show.

We'll see you along the way.
