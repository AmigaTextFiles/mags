<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends..."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hi, folks, and welcome back to SHOWTIME!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This month we're going to examine, in brief, The 3rd Annual Midwest Amiga Exposition, October 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, in Columbus, Ohio. At press time, an exhibitor list was not made available to The Amiga Monitor; however, there is information available on several web sites, from which we will issue the original press release and a brief overview of the upcoming event. At the conclusion of this report (and others to come) there will be an Update Feature listing developments and additional exhibitors who have committed to upcoming shows featured in previous issues of The Amiga Monitor. Without further ado:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Amiga Central Ohio Network Announces the 3rd Annual Midwest Amiga Exposition</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">AmiCON - The Amiga Central Ohio Network is proud to announce The 3rd Annual Midwest Amiga Exposition! We are excited to bring this dynamic event to the Amiga community, and we want you to be a part of it!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Where:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Hyatt Regency<BR>
350 North High Street<BR>
Columbus, OH. 43215<BR>
(614) 463-1234
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>When:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">October 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">With the continued success of the Midwest Amiga Exposition we are able to expand and grow to serve the Amiga community better than ever before! The Midwest Amiga Exposition was created for users by users in order to bring the community closer together. See and test drive the newest, most exciting Amiga products and systems available! Attend informational classes and seminars, and meet the people who support and develop for the Amiga. Everything Amiga under one roof for three days straight!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This year we have expanded the floor space to almost 7,000 square feet. More than double the size of last years show! Exhibitors can now rent space by the square foot with several size booths available: 6x5, 8x5, 13x11, 16x11, and 20x20. Six foot display tables with tablecloth and skirting are furnished with rental space for no extra charge. For those exhibitors who want a professional look, pipe and drape is also available for rental on a per foot basis.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Along with many Amiga notables and guest speakers, we will also have hourly prize raffles, games, contests, and a GRAND PRIZE drawing to highlight the event!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Seminars and classes are becoming an integral part of any serious Amiga show. Vendors and developers are anxious to present new and updated products to an eager community. We are committed to bringing top quality seminars to the Amiga community in order for you, the end user, to get the most out of your Amiga.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">To better serve show attendees, single day and two-day tickets for the Midwest Amiga Exposition will be available this year. And, don't worry about rushing to buy tickets ahead of time, all tickets will be available at the door to the show, thus eliminating any possible problems with "tickets lost in the mail."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On Friday, October 2nd developers from all over the world can meet to find out the latest in Amiga affairs. Classes and seminars will also be offered on that day as well.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Saturday, October 3rd, and Sunday, October 4th, the show floor will be open along with seminars and classes. Hourly prize raffles, games (with prizes!) and just about every company that sells something for the Amiga will be there.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The following is an abbreviated update of a show The Amiga Monitor featured last month, the Amiga West Coast Show, AmiWest 98. If you didn't catch the article last month, it can be read in its entirety at the following URL:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I went back to visit the home page of AmiWest (<A HREF="http://www.sacc.org/amiwest/">http://www.sacc.org/amiwest/</A>) and was pleased to see additions to the exhibitor listings. Visit the AmiWest 98 site for more detailed information about, and links to, sites of exhibitors, participating user groups, area businesses, attractions, and historic sites. In the meantime, a brief examination of the additional exhibitors who have committed to the show:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Amazing Computing/Amiga:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Amazing Computing, the world's first monthly Amiga publication, has been a dependable print medium for the Amiga Community for over eleven years, surviving for a significant amount of recent history on a regimen of 48 pages with a consistent diet of advertisers. With its "Amazing" army of about a half-dozen consistent, reliable authors, AC brings colorful, glossy graphics and slick ads from major players in the business to its readers. See this month's issue for the "Vote for your favorite Boing Ball election" or, as per their published instruction, visit their "boing" site at <A HREF="http://www.pimpub.com/boing.html">http://www.pimpub.com/boing.html</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>The Amiga Informer:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The "New Amiga Print 'Zine," a bimonthly publication, copyright Eldritch Enterprises and Pantheon Systems, offers one- and two-year subscriptions to the U.S., Canada, and overseas for varying rates. A "content query" directed to Fletcher Haug, Editor of The Amiga Informer, yielded a gracious response (Thank You, Fletcher!), so rather than attempt to rewrite and possibly change the meaning of his replies, I will herewith quote, with minor edits (a habit I cannot break from long nights of proofreading; now you know who to blame when a grammatical typo appears in The Amiga Monitor :) :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"The Amiga Informer website is basically a promotional tool for our print publication. We use it to generate interest in subscribing by showing readers our writing talent and editorial content.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"The website only contains a sampling of what we have in print, and it is posted several weeks after our print edition is in our subscribers' hands. We also post breaking news, editorials, and overruns to keep interest and traffic in between major updates.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Things that currently appear only in print are: my editorials, news bytes, product announcements, feature articles, show reports, interviews, Tips and hints, certain columns like Graphics Class, Audio Adventures, and Ask Dr. Amiga Q&A, Dealer contacts, Website listings, and of course our advertisers. So basically all you get on the site now is news stories (which are time-sensitive, reviews, and the occasional Site Seeing or Enhancements columns. We hope that if you like what is seen, you will subscribe to get it in a timely manner and pleasant, readable format. April marked our second full year of publishing, so we are into our third year now.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"It's important to remember that we have a partnership with Brad Webb, News Correspondent, to send his e-mail newsletter out to our paid subscribers. This is a large value-added incentive to subscribe -- if you have e-mail."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>There seems to be a preponderance of "Webb"'s in the Amiga publication field :)</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Brain Technologies</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Brain Technologies, a Sacramento-based company, is the producer of "Mr. Robot's Speak'n Spell," a picture-oriented word game for ages 6 and up, and "Pix Lib," a picture conversion and storage program with a library of 995 pictures. It allows you to view and then save any picture in IFF format for immediate use in DeluxePaint, Digi-Paint, and most other popular paint programs.</P>

Many thanks to John Zacharias for "slipping this one in under the door" just in time for publication.</I></P>
