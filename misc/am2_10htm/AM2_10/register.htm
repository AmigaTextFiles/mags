<P ALIGN="LEFT">Send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:mrw11@cornell.edu">mrw11@cornell.edu</A> (please check <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html">The AM Link Redirection Page</A> for an up-to-date e-mail address first if possible, but otherwise use this address) with "Register AM Mirror" as the subject, and specify the following information:</P>

<UL>
<LI>A precise URL to be listed as the mirror site
<LI>An e-mail address to which new issues of AM can be sent, and with which we can communicate with you
<LI>A short description of the site
<LI>The format(s) you will be carrying (HTML online, AmigaGuide online, HTML LhA, HTML ZIP, AmigaGuide LhA)
<LI>Whether you will keep archives of old issues available
<LI>A country or general geographic location of the server supplying your site
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">That's it! If we register your site as an official mirror site, you get a listing in the mirrors.htm file that comes with every issue, and eventually on The Webb Site itself. Thank you for supporting The Amiga Monitor.</P>
