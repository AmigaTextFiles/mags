<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Editor's Note: This month's Feedback column is dedicated entirely to reader responses to last month (Volume 2 Issue 9, May 1998, presumably available at <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/amiga/amiinfo/monitor/am2_9htm/am2_9.htm">http://www.cucug.org/amiga/amiinfo/monitor/am2_9htm/am2_9.htm</A>)'s "Editor's Notes" column which, not surprisingly, proved to generate a great deal, and a great variety, of feedback. Editor response to all will be published in a separate article (see <A HREF="am2_10.htm">Table of Contents</A>).</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Completely agree Michael, and with the announcements to be made at the WoA, a central company will once again have a 5-year roadmap, full funding from its parent, and a hunger to be the best.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If I were you, I wouldn't wait a month - get something up, even if it's only a first views and opinions mini-issue ASAP after WoA.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Thanks for telling it like it is. I appreciate your honesty of opinion in this latest issue of The Amiga Monitor. I have to agree with you that the current situation is very frustrating for everyone, all around.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">My current "fear" if you will concerns this latest announcement that is coming from AI. They say they'll have something big to announce at the WOA show on the 15th-16th <I>(Editor's Note: This message was received before the WOA show)</I>. Unfortunately, I don't rate this too highly, especially if you read betwixt the lines. While the IRC conference that popped up concerning this has something to the effect of: On a scale of 1-10 how revolutionary is this announcement? A 7. And in a year it'll be a 10.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At least this is what we're hearing from AI (Joe Torre). I am extremely frustrated by the lack of direction provided by AI. There are some hints that there will be some announcements concerning the future direction of AI, and the Amiga - these can be read in a very positive light, if you're an optimist.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">However, I am getting a vibe that simply isn't very positive. If you check the UAE (Unix Amiga Emulator) site (which Amiga Forever is based on), there's some indication of an extension to the emulator that will allow Amiga programs to call native code on the Intel platform. Essentially, this is the same as the PPC code modules on the PowerUP platform for the Amiga. A 68k application shell that calls binaries compiled for other processors.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I have this nasty feeling that something along these lines will be the announcement. Combine the Amiga card (PCI system by Siamese) with Amiga Forever with Native code... BOOM there goes the bottom of the Amiga HW market!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I don't want to run Windows. I don't want a Windows box to run Amiga. I want an Amiga box that runs the AmigaOS natively.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On the other hand - they may say just what is coming in OS3.5, and where they will be going next. They could announce support for standards such as Java, etc. They could enhance the ROM to make it Network-capable, etc. Heck - there even could be a strong alliance between AI, P5, and Index. If you ask me, that'd be great! But, I just am not seeing it.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Thanks for letting me rant - hope you don't mind.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As a long-time Amiga user, I can definitely understand the frustration you voiced in the current AM. However, I think you missed something in the announcements. Amiga Inc. is determining a direction, and will create standards for hardware and software that will have to be maintained for vendors to be allowed to be called "Amiga-compatible." What they will not be doing is actually building machines and pushing them out the door themselves, which does not spell the doom of our beloved machine. It is a viable method of creating a larger user base that can work. Everyone's complaints about using Amiga technology in embedded aps and set-top boxes seems to ignore the fact that it will be a way to get the technology into millions of users' hands that would never go out and buy an Amiga per se. The embedded aps market dwarfs the PC industry, and could create sufficient cashflow to fund incredible amounts of R&D. After all, Microsloth does not make machines, and see how rich they are. The reason the convergence and similar markets have not "happened" yet is because there is no decent OS that will work reliably and still be small. I think you will end up being amazed at what our friendly little OS will do when unleashed beyond the PC market. These other aps will only strengthen the Amiga. I have worked in telephone and television arenas for over 20 years, and I understand what Amiga, Inc. is up to.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I would encourage you not to give up, even though I, too, have had dark moments lately where I have considered moving to a new platform. I actually sat down and did a cost analysis of migrating to a new platform, buying new software, etc., and it would end up costing more than the highest-performing Amiga system currently available, including PPC accelerator. And I mean thousands more, just to duplicate my aging A3000 setup.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Amiga community has stuck together and worked hard to keep our friend alive, and even if we have to create a consortium of third-party vendors to make the machine we want, we can do it. The fact that GW2K is licensing is a very good sign for people who want to pursue their own vision of Amiga technology. I know it is hard to keep waiting, but we must keep the faith and remember how far we have come already.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga uber alles!!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I read your latest editorial with dismay. Does Amiga Inc. REALLY need to manufacture the box?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm sorry you've "almost had it" with Amiga as a platform.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As a user for almost 10 years, I've seen THE NEXT BIG THING come and go for this machine, but wow, what a ride. All of the best recent innovations have come from true believers unconnected with the parent company. All I want is someone to support THEM and to help keep us all moving forward. Much of that support needs to come from US.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The reason there is STILL an Amiga at all is US, not whether some company with a magic wand makes everything perfect.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A lot of people do NOT buy "IBM's"; they in fact most buy clones, and slavishly so.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So "support your local" Amiga, user group, dealer, etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It ain't over yet.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hi,</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Bet you're expecting a lot of e-mails about /that/ :)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Anyway, I was just writing to inform you that although Amiga Inc. will /probably/ not make Amigas for general release (this of course depends on market conditions as always), it has always been a very strong possibility that they will make "Reference Amigas" - the so-called genuine Amiga in your article.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, you can't quote me on this, because I am unable to back this up with any evidence :)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hi,</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Just read the latest Amiga Monitor and specifically your editorial on recent events. I note this issue was released before the even more depressing recent news from AI regarding choice of CPU ("x86-based," if I interpret their comments correctly). The sad part is, I am seeing people publicly verbalize their discouragement with these developments, people who used to be rock-solid supporters of the platform (I am fervently hoping that Aminet doesn't fold!)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I myself have had my A1200 with 50-MHz '030 for almost two years and haven't regretted it at all. I will be purchasing ImageFX 3.0 early next month (coinciding with another pay cycle) and intend to pursue additional, limited expansions to my A1200 as time and budget permit.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As you implied in your editorial, life will continue regardless of the availability (or not) of a platform even if it's the Amiga. It's a sensible suggestion that one ought to use the computer with which one is most comfortable, and I believe many Amigans will continue to do exactly that, and not succumb to the herd instinct.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ah, well! I will continue reading the Monitor for as long as you choose to publish it! Thanks for taking the time to read this!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hi there.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm a long time Amiga fan and a programmer as well, and I just want to let you know I heartily agree with the overall subject of the editorial of April 1998. I also would like to say that I will not buy a Wintel Box to run some kind of development package for a new x86-based Amiga, but will support phase 5 and Haage & Partner, as their decisions are more sound and less hype.</P>
