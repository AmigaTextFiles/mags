<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>For those of you who have been off-planet, The Amiga Monitor reprints here "The Shot Heard Round Cyberspace" </B>...and then we can get on to other press releases :)<B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">London, UK - May 15, 1998 - </B>Amiga Inc., a pioneer in multimedia development, today announced plans to provide a new software architecture that will offer enhanced levels of performance and useability for the Amiga community. Amiga will develop and license software technology that offers leading multimedia solutions for the emerging digital convergence market.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Amiga has the opportunity to move ahead of the industry in setting standards to follow," said Jeff Schindler, general manager of Amiga, Inc. "By working closely with Amiga developers and user groups, we will all have the opportunity to share in this exciting, emerging market."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">To build upon Amiga's legacy as a multimedia leader, the company announced Amiga OS 4.0 which is slated to launch in November of '98. Amiga OS 4.0 will have a new user interface and support Amiga legacy software with an integrated emulator. Hardware developers are already working on solutions for software and hardware backward compatibility with the new Amiga architecture.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga, Inc. also announced plans to unveil a personal computer that is an industry standard architecture solution. The new system will provide a bridge to the next generation of Amiga technology. The system is scheduled for availability in November with a suggested retail price of USD$999. These systems will be available through Amiga International.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Also available soon, Amiga Inc. will host www.amiga.com, the official web site for developer news, information, and relations. Amiga International's site, www.amiga.de, will continue to be the location for Amiga distributors and legacy product sales and licensing.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>About Amiga</I></P>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">THE AMIGA COMMUNITY LIASON GROUP PRESS RELEASE</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">May 10, 1998</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Amiga Community Liaison Group</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Amiga Community Liaison Group (ACLG) is a group being formed by members of the ICOA, Team Amiga, and the Jay Miner Society, among others, to help them keep in touch with each other and coordinate their activities where this makes sense. Our intention is to include representatives from Amiga organisations all around the world in this.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The first two subjects considered by the ACLG have been the need for an independent channel for Amiga news, and the question of how to provide support for the ICOA User Representative to be elected in June.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The first of these has been dealt with by the creation of the Amiga News Feed. This is a system by which Amiga news will be collected and forwarded to Amiga magazines, news sites and other interested parties. News items will not be edited, but must be attributed and limited in length and format. Amiga Inc and others have already arranged to send out their news via the Amiga News Feed. The News Feed will take the form of a read-only mailing list.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The second question is under continued discussion. The purpose of having a User Rep is to keep developers in touch with the needs of ordinary users. Therefore we hope that those user group members and magazine staff in daily contact with people who are doing useful things with Amiga computers, but who aren't part of the online community, will join these discussions within the ACLG.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">GAMES MASTER SYSTEM PRESS RELEASE</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">May 22, 1998</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This announcement covers the most important release yet of the Games Master System, signifying an end to 2 years of design and public beta testing. This has been a long awaited development in the programming community, but public exposure has been kept to a minimum in the past 6 months. Adequate coverage of this announcement will be highly appreciated, thank you in advance for your assistance.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Also feel free to review the system, if you have any questions I will be happy to answer them. If you've forgotten why GMS is so good (shame on you :-), have a read of the feature list.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Best Amiga wishes,</P>

Games Master System<BR>

</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">VERSION</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="LEFT">1.0 (Released May 1998)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">AUTHOR</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="LEFT">Paul Manias (<A HREF="mailto:paul@ethos.co.nz">paul@ethos.co.nz</A>)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">DESCRIPTION</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Games Master System is a developers kit that is aimed at enhancing the functionality of the AmigaOS, with emphasis on games programming. It is based on the Amiga shared library standard, so will work with any programming language such as C, Assembler, E, Basic etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The system can be ported across to other platforms besides the Amiga, and in future GMS programs could be run on other platforms without recompilation (CPU's must match or they have to be emulated).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Here are just a few of the features:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Object Oriented kernel design.
<LI>Fast blitter functions, including CPU assisted blitting.
<LI>In-built proportional fading functions.
<LI>Sound support, includes intelligent channel play-back.
<LI>Support for raster/copperlists with built-in special FX.
<LI>Automatic XPK decompression.
<LI>External structure and object pre-processing, allows user editing of program data.
<LI>Support for automatic picture remapping and resizing features.
<LI>Screen support includes double/triple buffering, and invisible chunky emulation.
<LI>Full resource tracking.
<LI>Support for all kinds of input devices (joysticks, joypads etc)
<LI>An official system debugger is provided.
<LI>A user preference program that allows editing of things such as default screen dimensions, resolutions, mode promotion etc.
<LI>Multi-tasking and screen-switching is supported.
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The system has a very modern design and includes full resource tracking and safe task destruction features. The debugger is incorporated into the system itself, so there is no need for special patches or debugging tools. Functions are written with garbage protection features and where possible, software based memory protection. GMS can recover from many programming errors that usually result in software failures.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Full documentation and over 70 demo sources in C, Assembler and E are included within the developer archive.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A full installation will take up 2 megs of space on your hard drive. KingCON or any other enhanced shell with a scroll back buffer is desirable for running IceBreaker.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Support is given for E, SAS/C, StormC, DiceC, DevPac and PhxAss.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">AVAILABILITY
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">GMS is available on all up to date Aminet sites, for example:</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><A HREF="ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_dev.lha">ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_dev.lha</A> (590 kB)</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><A HREF="ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_user.lha">ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_user.lha</A> (240 kB)</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Developers will need both archives; Users will only need the second archive.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">PRICE
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Developers are required to pay a license fee when a game is released. Costs start at $20US for shareware games. Freeware developers do not have to pay this fee.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The user package is shareware based. On registration you will get an unrestricted version of GMSPrefs, access to e-mailed updates, bug fixes and so on. The cost is $20US, and the registration will last for 2 years.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">DISTRIBUTABILITY
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The gms_dev.lha and gms_user.lha archives are freely distributable, provided they remain unchanged. The Games Master System is (c) Copyright 1996-1998 Paul Manias / DreamWorld Productions.</P>
