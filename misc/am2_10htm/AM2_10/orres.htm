<P ALIGN="LEFT">The following announcement was posted recently regarding the demise of yet another Amiga-related business.

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Editor's Note: The following is republished here without explicit permission from Oregon Research. However, we felt that it was appropriate to spread the news of this saddening event, and assist in the successful, although unfortunate, conclusion of Oregon Research's inventory and business asset liquidation.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A sad sad day...</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Welcome to the final edition of the Oregon Research News. This last year has been difficult for all Amiga users and even more so for us at Oregon Research. This is a sad day in the world of Amiga. After ten years of service, it is with great sadness that I must announce that Oregon Research is going out of business.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The expenses of operation have far exceeded business income for too long and our creditors have lost their patience. Even though Jo and I have both taken jobs outside of the business to help repay the debts, it is not enough.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In an effort to repay our business debts and avoid personal financial ruin, we are forced to liquidate all of our inventory and business assets. We have tried to avoid this action for as long as possible. Unfortunately, time and the bill collector caught up with us before Gateway could deliver on their promises.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I want to take this opportunity to personally thank each and every one of you for supporting us over the years. Without your loyal support, Oregon Research would never have been possible and my personal dream of building my own business would never have become a reality. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. My only regret is no longer having the opportunity to serve such a wonderful subset of the human race.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Until we meet again.....</P>
