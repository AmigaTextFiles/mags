<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Milk of Magnesia</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Probably everybody faces digestive irregularity from time to time. Milk of Magnesia is a time-honored solution that usually gets things moving downstairs.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">After a prolonged period of constipation, something moved at Amiga recently. The announcement came at the World of Amiga show in London, and it certainly was momentous.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm not going to reiterate details, since you probably have seen them already (and if not, can find plenty of references to them within this issue), but although the recent announcement was an extremely good sign, there certainly has been a lack of clarity. I don't know about you, but I'm still confused. It would now appear that most of what Joe Torre told us a few months ago in the now-[in]famous self-interview is null and void. 680x0 and PPC? Nah. Maybe we'll even see new Amigas from Amiga itself, gosh forbid.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga, it's good to see you're back. But eat yer fiber, and you won't need to take the Milk of Magnesia approach with us again. We could all benefit from a little more regularity.</P>

<A HREF="nccl.htm">Amigas in Education</A><BR>
<B><I>By Jerimy Campbell</I></B><BR>
It's always a breath of fresh air to find Amigas being used in a somewhat unusual environment. As Jer details, there's one school in Newark, Delaware where Amigas take part in day-to-day educational duties. These days, however, their position there is threatened by the lack of Amiga educational software, and the general encroachment of Wintel.<BR>
