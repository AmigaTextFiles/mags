<P>
This film actually has 2 story lines. It starts with a young girl who gets fired from her job in a big office.<BR>
Then it shows you when she gets on the tube to get home to find her boyfriend in bed with another woman.<BR>
She storms off to her friends house, not wanting anything to do with the boyfroend.  She ends up falling in love<BR>
with John Hannah's character.  She even starts her own company up, which does reaaly well.<BR>
But the story line that shows you her missing the tube home, ends up having to go by bus and gets home to a<BR>
loving boyfriend, and she is none the wiser about his affair with the other woman. But he still tries to see her<BR>
behind his girlfriends back without being obvious.<BR>
In both the story lines she dies by being knocked down in one.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
THE PLOT- An example of the way that a seemingly pointless incodent can have a profound effect on one persons life.<BR>
