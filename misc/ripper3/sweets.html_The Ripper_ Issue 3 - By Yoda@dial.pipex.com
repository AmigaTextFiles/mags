<CENTER>I don't know about you! But I'm fed up to my</CENTER> <BR>

           <CENTER>back teeth, With manufacturers who indiscriminately</Center><BR>

           <CENTER>muck about with the names of our Sweets.</Center><BR>

           <CENTER>First it was the good old Marathon! Now I loved </Center><BR>

           <CENTER>a Marathon and often approached the young girl  </Center><BR>

           <CENTER>at my local shop, And asked "Do you have a large</Center><BR>

           <CENTER>Marathon?" Then they changed the name, Now its  </Center><BR>

           <CENTER>called a SNICKER!  I mean for Christ sake, </Center><BR>

           <CENTER>If I go into the shop now and ask the girl if she's</Center><BR>

           <CENTER>got LARGE SNICKERS? the next thing you know is  </Center><BR>

           <CENTER>People are getting Spray Paint cans and writing </Center><BR>

           <CENTER>"Pervert" across your door in the middle of the Night! </Center><BR>

<P>

           <CENTER>Next came good old Opal Fruits (Made to make your </Center><BR>

           <CENTER>Mouth Water), Suddenly with out warning they became</Center><BR>

           <CENTER>"STARBURST"  Oh come on! When a star bursts you get</Center><BR>

          <CENTER>clouds of Cosmic dust and showers of Meteorites, You</Center><BR>

          <CENTER>Don't get little coloured lumps of Fruit flavoured </Center><BR>

          <CENTER>Chews!  So where will it all end?   Will HUMBUGS </Center><BR>

          <CENTER>Become SMELLYANTS, PANDROPS Become KETTLEUPS and </Center><BR>

          <CENTER>GOD FORBID!- STRIPED BALLS Become TWO-TONE-TESTICLES </Center><BR>
           <P>
           <P>
          <CENTER>I just wish they would leave our SWEETIES alone! </Center><BR>
