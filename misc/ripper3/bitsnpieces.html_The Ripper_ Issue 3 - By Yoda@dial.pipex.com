             <CENTER>Now I read an interesting article in the

             Newspapers this week! Its all about a couple

             of pensioners (Dick and Sylvia) Who have booked

             their holidays, A tour of the Western Isles,

             In Scotland, To allow Dick to pursue his Hobby of

             Collecting ASDA Receipts from every store in Britian.<br>

             They have currently spent around £10,000 and travelled

             60,000 miles to visit 217 Supermarkets.<BR>

             Dick commented "I'd be a couch Potato if I wasn't

             doing this, Its as exciting as collecting Stamps!"

             His long time demented wife, Accepts his Bizarre hobby

             But recently put her foot down, And forced Dick to ditch

             His collection of 3,500 ASDA Carrier bags!<BR>

             NOW! I shop in ASDA! And I can tell you this, If Dick

             Is 74, And HAS visited 217 Stores, Then he has spent

             the best part of his life, Standing at the Check-outs!

             Well there is some sad people in the world! But this

             Dick must take the Biscuit (Asda Brand).<BR>

             I just hope They don't have any Children Sitting awaiting an

             Inheritance! WANT MY ADVISE "DICK" ?<BR>

             <U>GET A BLOODY AMIGA!</U> </CENTER>

              <CENTER>OK! No doubt you have heard the Wonderful news?

              Members of the Civil Services are being specially

              Trained in the art of Blowing up Horses Nostrils!

              This is an old Red Indian method of calming down

              Excitable pony's.

              I suppose there is something comforting in the

              Knowledge, That if you go out for the morning

              Papers and are confronted by an Angry herd of

              roving Mustangs, All you have to do is grab the

              old mobile, And within minutes a Civil Servant

              will appear and take control of the situation!

              Now, To be honest, We don't get a lot of Mustangs

              in my part of the country, And most of the horses

              I see are on Channel four! However I can't help

              Wondering, If blowing up a horses nose will calm

              it down, What would happen if you gave it a quick

              PUFF at the other end?

              Well if you happen to be watching the racing on

              the telly, And this wee fella runs into the Paddock

              and has a quick Blow up a Horses Arse! ALL WAVE AND

              SHOUT HELLO IAN!</CENTER>

              <CENTER>SO! Our wonderful new Government is trying to persuade

              us all to abandon our cars and either use public

              transport, or the humble bike! Well let take them one

              at a time, And see what we see.<P>

              <U>THE BICYCLE-</U> Well I am the first to admit that I'm

              no spring chicken, And in my day the humble bike was

              a large metal thing with two wheels and a little bell!

              Nothing like the bicycles you get now a days, A carbon

              Fibre frame, 24 gears and racing handle bars!<br>

              Now! I'm sorry, But when you jump on to one of these

              things and grab the flashy handle bars, You find that

              your head is between your knees and your arse is

              pointing into the air! By the time you have gone 500

              yards you have a severe case of friction burns on

              both sides of your face, Where your knees have been

              rubbing the skin to shreds, And to cap it all, You

              have probably run into a brick wall, As your head is

              so far down you can't see the road ahead!

              There is worse than that! In my day, To be a trendy

              cyclist you got your self a pair of Bicycle clips!

              Not so today! You need a Multi-coloured top, A pair of

              Cycling shorts ( Scrotum squashers) Special shoes and

              To cap it all you have to walk about with a honey-dew

              Melon stuck on your napper!

              So then what happens? You cycle to work, Chain up your

              Prize bike, Return at 5 o'clock, Only to find some

              Thieving bugger has unscrewed the front wheel and

              nicked ¾ of your bike! And boy do you look and feel

              a plonker sitting on a bus dressed in all that fancy

              Cycling gear!

              THE TRAIN- OH HO! When was the last time John Prescott

              Travelled 2nd class on a train? There you are sitting

              knee deep in urine, Watching the junkie opposite you

              trying to inject himself with heroin! NO THANKS !

              THE BUS-OH! Great, You sit on the top deck minding your

              own business, Then the resident DRUNK gives you a chorus

              Of "THE GREEN GREEN GRASS OF HOME" Then pukes up all

              over you. As you arrive at your stop, You fight your way

              through knee-deep, Coke cans, Sweetie papers and Orange

              peel, And when you arrive at the Stairway, The bloody

              driver slams on the anchors, Catapulting you head first

              down the metal stairs, Eventually you arrive home CUT

              BRUISED AND STINKING OF PUKE!

              AH! But you say, All large towns and cities now have.... </CENTER>
                           <H3>
<CENTER></H3>PARK AND RIDE!</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>Well I have news for you, I got arrested for that 20 years ago!</CENTER>

<CENTER>I still don't understand how the Policeman could see through the steamed-up windows,</CENTER>

<CENTER>But he did, And the girl didn't speak to me again either.</CENTER>

<CENTER>SO Mr PRESCOTT, I'M GOING TO BE LIKE YOU, AND CONTINUE</CENTER>

<CENTER>USING MY GAS GUZZLER OF A CAR, SO THERE!</CENTER>
