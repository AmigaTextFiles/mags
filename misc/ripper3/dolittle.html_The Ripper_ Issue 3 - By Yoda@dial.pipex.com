This is a Great re-make of the old one, Set in today! Staring Eddie Murphy<BR>
Laughs by the bucket load, It starts with a small boy who as a gift of talking to animals,<BR>
But no one (including his dad) takes him seriously. He then out growes his "Gift" and becomes a Good doctor.<BR>
Then after a car accedent, he finds that the "Gift" has returned! All hell starts to break loose, As all the<BR>
animals in the city start to turn up at his house!<BR>
