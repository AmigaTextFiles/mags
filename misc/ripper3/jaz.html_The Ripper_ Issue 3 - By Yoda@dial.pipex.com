IF you are like me and you are running out of Harddrive space, Then This is the ULTIMATE Soloution<BR>
True zips are a good option, So for that matter are (like mine)Syquest Drives! The one I had a shot of was a SCSI Fitting!
The First thing to do when buying one is to Format it! Becouse as we all know the Amiga Don't exist! and so you won't
get more that a blank look if you ask for an Amiga Formated Cartridge. (1st one is free)<BR>
<P>
In the forst RIPPER MAG we told you how to Format a removable cartridge. (Available on Aminet)<BR>
So - We have formated one! and incase you don't knotice, a whole week has passed. At leat I think it was a week!<BR>
Power Amiga or  no Power Amiga, its still too bloody slow. Then again Pc users Probably wont knotice!
<P>
Not mutch to say, its big, its fast, and the cartridges fit into your pocket!
