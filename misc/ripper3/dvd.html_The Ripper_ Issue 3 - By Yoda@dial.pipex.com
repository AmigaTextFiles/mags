The DVD Rom disks looks just like CD-roms - BUT - they hold a big surprise! Yes they hold up to 26 times the capasity.
SO you can fit an entire feature film, plus the sound tracks(+there videos) and commentary on the one disk!<BR>
<P>
It's a new and exciting technology, And the prospects are breathtaking! But Don't go getting too excited!<BR>
You can't go storing your stuff on a DVD-ROM disk! That has to be done on with <U><B>DVD RAM!</B></U>
Install the LF-D101 in your computer and you can then put as much junk on it that you want!
<P>
You can Add data and Delete Like a BIG-ASS Floppy! They are selling them at the sises of 2.6GB and 5.2GB. But Don't forget,
once you have formated them they hold 2.3/4.6GB!! But hay!!! It still holds one Hell-of-a lot of information.
<P>
This drive is also compatable with DVD-Roms and CD-Rom disks!
