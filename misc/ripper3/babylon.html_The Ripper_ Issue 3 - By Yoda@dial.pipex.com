This is the first Babylon5 Movie on Video. Jumping on the Sci-Fi Band wagon of Star Wars,<BR>
Only this time it is set a meer 200 years in the futue. It tells the story of the Earth Minbarie war.<BR>
Spwaned by the origional T.V Series, (on sky at the moment) The surprise of this Film<P>
and indeed the series, Is that the Special Effects are actualy on the Amiga! (light wave-I think)<BR>
It as ever is full of truly mind-blowing space sciens. That pluss the great script,<BR>
makes this film a joy to watch! It also explains a few things about the series that puzzle some folk.<BR>
I recomend this film, and hope that it is the first of many.<BR>
(yes I know that you can buy videos of Babylon 5 already<font color=#FF0000> - BUT - <font Color=#00CCFF>Not Like this.....Not at thi quality!!!
