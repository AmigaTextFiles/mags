SO! Just exactly what do you think of when you hear the words Garden Party? Is it a vision of China Tea cups,Champagne,
Or Dainty Cucumber

   Sandwiches, Sipped and nibbled in lush green lawns, Or perhaps an

   invite from the Queen herself? Yes! the words generate lots of thoughts

   BUT! A garden party in Cumbernauld takes on a completely different

   meaning altogether! A garden party in this part of the World is when

   people you barely know, Decide that it is to hot and Sunny to stay

   in their Flats, And come uninvited, into the sanctuary of <B>YOUR</B> garden.

   Read on and you will see what I mean!<BR>

It was a lovely Sunny day! Ann and I relaxing in our little bit of heaven, There we were, lying back in the loungers reading<BR>
the Sunday papers with not a care in the world! What could be better? Suddenly our faithful Dalmation (Domino) half opened
one eye and sort of went OOF! Before his head sank slowly to the ground, This is his system of letting us know that someone
is at the door (He is like a coiled spring! ). I'LL GET IT DEAR! I says to Ann! I Presumed it would be the norm!
Someone selling Religion at the door, (You know the sort? You open the door and they shout" WARCRY!" then you shout" GERONIMO!"
and close the door in their faces! ) So! not being faint of heart I answered the door! AS I opened that large wooden Panel
that keeps me secluded from the World, There they were! 4 Adults and 4 Kids ( Who the hell are they?)<BR>

Shouts the eldest!" Hello!" said I," IS ANNIE IN" EH! Yes shes in the garden! There was no more to be said! They just brushed
me aside and all Eight trooped through my house and into the Back Garden. Now Ann and I have been together a long time!
But I still can't remember:-
<P>
<font color=#ff0000>
<OL>
<LI>UNCLE Bob,
<P>
<LI>AUNTIE Ella,
<P>
<LI>Their laddie Jimmy,
<P>
<LI>His Wife
<P>
<LI>Their four briedsnappers.
<P>

Anyway by the time I recovered from this shock and returned to the garden the four kid were sitting around the garden table
looking expectantly at Ann and I! Would you like something to eat? BIG MISTAKE! Ann and I spent the next 45 minutes in the
Kitchen roasting Chicken portions and  Frying enormous portions of chips! As I was in charge of the chips, I took the opportunity
to sneak into the living room, And hide away my monthly supply of beer! I managed To plank 4 cans and had the second pack
in my hands when Jimmy decided to use our Toilet! SPOTTED!<BR>
<P>

<P>
<CENTER><H1>" HERE DAD! THINGIE'S GETTING THE BEERS IN"</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<font color=#4c4c4c>
I smile sickly! and wander out to the garden with the 4 pack, Jimmy (Who has forgotten about his BLADDER) Follows with the
remaining 16 cans! I stand and watch in AWE! As Bob, One Handed, Grabs a can, Pulls the ringpull, Drains the contents,
crushes the can and places it back on the table!      He stands up and says " GOING FOR A PISS, MAKE MORE ROOM!) At this
point I knew my beer was doomed! The Children, Having been fed, Decided it was time to explore!<BR>
<P>
<P>
<font color=#ffffff>
Now! I must explain here, The nearest these people have come to a Garden is the Fungi growing up the Rising damp in the
bedroom! Or the Dandelion growing in the guttering on the block of Flats opposite! Presumably the Seed having been
Excreted by some poor unfortunate Seagull, Which has been grabbed by the neck and dragged into the top Flat to end up as
the Sunday roast!<BR>
<P>
<P>
<font color=#4c4c4c>
I, having been brought UP in Inverness, Do not speak as most people from Glasgow do, So presumably this is the reason why I
just got blank looks from the children, When I tried to explain to them, That the Wet Sprinkly thing in the centre of the
Garden, Was in fact a PEBBLE POOL and not a Urinal nor a drinking Fountain! And they continued to use it as they saw fit.
SUDDENLY! The eldest child gave a Blood Curdling Scream :-<BR>
<P>
<P>

OH! She had come across the Greenfly on our Lupins, Now for years we Have had a problem with Greenfly on out Lupins, We have
tried Sprays And powder of all sorts! Silly us! With in 30 seconds she had wiped  out the whole colony of Greenfly, If only
we had thought of using a size 6 trainer, So much friendlier for the environment! As I sat devastated in my chair, the head
of the youngest of the Snottery nosed kids suddenly appeared from the centre of our lovely Crocosmia masonrum Plant,
With a childish gleam on his face, He ran in a straight line, To his Mother, Avoiding neither plant nor seed, And Proudly
showed her the Caterpillar he had found! I stared at the trail of devastation he had left in his wake, And Thought to Myself,
Well he is only a child! His mother smiled lovingly at him and said :-<BR>
<P>
<P>
<font color=#00ff00>
<CENTER><H1>"AT'S NICE DEAR, NOW PUT IT BACK WHERE YOU FOUND IT!"</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<font color=#4c4c4c>
where upon this miniature bulldozer, turned around and selecting a completely different route, Returned in to the centre of
the Crocosmia! At this point THE HAIR AT THE BACK OF MY NECK STARTED TO STAND UP! However a quick glance over my shoulder,
Confirmed my worst fears! The third child had dismantled our garden lights and reconnected the wires up to my chair!
<I>( He would never be out of work in America!).</I><BR>
Sitting at the table, I looked at the last child, A young Blond Girl, Of about five, She was sitting totally engrossed, and
drawing the most beautiful picture of a Butterfly that I have ever seen!:-<BR>

<CENTER><H1>"OH! THAT'S LOVELY"</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<font color=#4c4c4c>
I said, Uncle Bob glowered at me! and said
<P>
<font color=#00ff00>
<P>
<CENTER><H1>" DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH HER, SHE'S NO LIKE THE REST! SHE'S NO THE FULL SHILLING! "</H1></CENTER>
<font color=#4c4c4c>
<P>
<p>
Thank God for that, I thought! However as time wore on, And the sun started to set, We moved indoors, Ann and I soon found
ourselves in the Kitchen again cooking egg and chips to feed the hungry hoards! And at around nine PM, They started talking
about getting a taxi!  Ann foolishly pointed out that a Taxi would not take eight of them, To which they replied,
<P>
<P>
<font color=#00ff00>
<CENTER><H1>"Well as long as you don't Mind doing two trips"</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<font color=#4c4c4c>
Ann and I looked at each other, We didn't offer! Well I don't think we did, But it appears that regardless we were Responsible
for getting them home. While Ann went to get the car from the garage, They decided that the Women and children would go in
the first trip, The men would just stay and have a wee drink! I thought to my self, Where are they going to get a drink at
this time on a Sunday night! The shop is closed and the Pub is about two miles away! OH GOD! One of that little buggers
(KIDS) had been in the cupboard and there in plain view was the four pack I had hidden!<P>
So as Ann took the first lot home, the men sat and drank my remaining  Beer, Of course three into four doesn't go! So they
took two each, I Was the host and had to make some sacrifice! Eventually! Ann returned and we loaded the remaining drunks
in to the back of the car, A shiver went through my body, When Bob Said
<P>
<P>
<font color=#00ff00>
<CENTER><H1>"MUST DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME!"</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<font color=#4c4c4c>
and off they went, While I enlisted the help of the garden shovel to try to tidy up the living room before Ann Returned.
If I thought the problems were over, I was so wrong! The next morning, I arose and tried to shave! But my Electric razor
Was making a strange noise! Upon inspection it was full of white hairs! Making my way downstairs to Draw this to
Anns attention, I heard a Sort of Whining noise from the spare bedroom! On opening the door, there stood a rather cold
Dalmation! Only now he was bright PINK and Not a hair on his body! Oh God!<BR>
