Well! I wonder what you thought when you read this heading? Sorry but this may come as a bit of a shock! You see,
I am getting a bit fed up reading all The nasty things you currently get in Magazines about PCs!You know the type,
Someone write in And mentions a PC then in brackets (SPIT!)(PUKE!) or (BOO,HISS!). How BLOODY Childish can you get?<BR>
<P>

<H1><CENTER>Amiga??? Whats That?....</CENTER></H1>

However having said that! I am also Sick to my Back Teeth of COMPUTER Magazines, refusing to Acknowledge that the Amiga IS a Computer!
Only recently an Amiga user wrote in to "COMPUTER ACTIVE" and in response, They said there Magazine was for PC users!
However if you have ever read this magazine, It contains articles on<BR>


<CENTER>Mac's,<BR>
<P>
Playstation,<BR>
<P>
Sega Saturns,<BR>
<P>
Mobile Phones<BR></CENTER>
<P>
and a Whole host of other things! But talk of the Amiga  and they blow your Arse out of the Window!<BR>
<P>
RIGHT! Now for a bold statement!<BR>
<P>
                 <CENTER>THE PC IS AN EXCELLENT MACHINE! ITS BIG, ITS FAST<BR>
<P>
                 ITS POWERFUL And ITS GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY!<BR>
<P>
                 So! You ask Why don't I have one? SIMPLE!<BR>
<P>
                 <U>I DON'T NEED a BIG,FAST,and POWERFUL Machine!</U><BR>
<P>
                For all that I do on the Computer, <H2>The Amiga Serves my needs!</H2><BR></CENTER>

The point here, Is that the General Public are being CONNED into buying a Computer that is well above the Spec
that they actually require! Now! Quite a lot of people buy a computer to keep  their children happy!
Yes they COULD buy a games Console! But they are sold on the Idea that if they Buy a PC,
Then they can use that for writing letters and doing home accounts! But you can do all this  on the Amiga! And for a fraction of the cost.
There is also a large percentage of homes in Britian that still don't have a Computer of any type, Why?<br><H1></H1>
Because they can't afford it! I know I said that a  PC is excellent value, And you can pick up a system  for around £600,
But a lot of families still can't afford this sort of outlay. This is the gap that the HOME COMPUTER was designed to Bridge!
And the Amiga IS THE only HOME COMPUTER left. <BR>
Surely it would make more sense if Computer magazines, And PC RETAILERS ENCOURAGED
People who can't afford a large system, To buy an Amiga! Well the more people using some sort of Computer the Better
And it s a Natural progression to move on to a better or more powerful Machine! So by paging the lower end of the market to buy an Amiga,
They are almost certain to increase the user base of PCs in a couple of years time! So to all of you out there!
Both the Amiga and The PC have a role to play in the future of the country and Computers in general, So Lets All try and get on together!
and STOP slagging Each other off!<BR>
