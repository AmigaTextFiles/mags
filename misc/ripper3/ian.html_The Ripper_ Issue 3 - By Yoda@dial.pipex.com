<CENTER>   Well I expect you will be wanting to know a little about Me
<P>
   I am 46 years old, I have plenty time to sit at the
<P>
   Amiga and write letter to any contacts that I have!
<P>
   Well! I had a long and varied career,
<P>
   First I served my Apprenticeship as A Fitter Welder, A trade that I
<P>
   got fed up with at the age of 22. I then got the opportunity to
<P>
   join British Rail, As a Train Catering Steward! I worked with B.R.
<P>
   for 16 years, Eventually becoming the Circuit Group Manager for train
<P>
   catering based at Edinburgh Waverely. I Have 4 children,
<P>
   So left the position in Edinburgh to spend more time with them.
<P>
   After trying to gain employment in Catering for almost a full year
<P>
   and having no success, I eventually joined a Security company, And
<P>
   worked for OKI at their factory in Cumbernauld. I remained in this
<P>
   Industry until I was forced to stop working several years ago.
<P>
   So, how did I get into computers?
<P>
   Well many years ago I bought my children a Spectrum ZX, And I think
<P>
   I used it as much as they did, From there it seemed a natural
<P>
   progression to get a Commodore 64! In fact I bought 3 of them, 2
<P>
   of which I still have tucked away in my loft!
<P>
   Having plenty time on my hands, When I stopped work, I turned to
<P>
   the old 64, To pass the time, And spent many happy hours playing
<P>
   Tracksuit Manager, However things were changing, Games for the 64
<P>
   were hard to come by, And the old Tape deck was past its best, I
<P>
   often had to fiddle about with a Screwdriver to try to get the Dammed
<P>
   thing to load, And then it would crash! So Ann ( My second wife)
<P>
   sneaked out one day and bought me a second hand Amiga 500!
<P>
   Now! This machine was a bog standard Amiga, But it was a revelation
<P>
   to me, Never did I dream I would own one, And the floppy disk was
<P>
   amazing, Well compared to the 64 tapes! I was HOOKED, And started
<P>
   to add and expand the machine. However after a year, I realised that
<P>
   The 500 was a dead machine! Most of the new games were 1200, So
<P>
   After a talk with Ann, And receiving her blessing, I sold the 500
<P>
   and bought this second hand 1200,
<P>
   Amazing! and I started to <A Href="Ianspage/setup.html">expand it.</A>
<P>
   SO! What do I use this fantastic machine for? Well sadly up until
<P>
   about a year ago, Nothing but GAMES! however I always knew it was
<P>
   good for so much more, And slowly I have turned from games to other
<P>
   Avenues, Such as Desk Top Publishing, And do quite a bit of work
<P>
   for friend and family! I would love to learn to Program, But to
<P>
   be honest, Every time I try, It just seems to go over my head,Still
<P>
   you never know, Perhaps some day!   </CENTER>
<P>

<P>
   <Center>In recent months I have started to write to other Amiga users, And
<P>
   I have received a lot of help and assistance from them, I am now
<P>
   A lot more confident about using the Amiga than ever before.
<P>
   Well, That is a short version of my life History, If you want to
<P>
  Know more! Well just Write, That is what this disk is all about,
<P>
  Getting to know others that use the Amiga! So please get in touch
<P>
  I will always reply to your letters! </CENTER>
