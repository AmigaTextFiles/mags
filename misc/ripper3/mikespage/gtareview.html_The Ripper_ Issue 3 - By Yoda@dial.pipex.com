 My word this caused a stir at release - Old people all over the place
threw up their arms (or got their carers to do it for them) in protest.
Politicians and other kill joys, jealous of the choice in options for
younger people these days decided that seeing as they didn't like the game
then no one else should be allowed to make up their own minds. Jeremy Paxman
even got in on the act on Newsnight.  Thankfully for us of the free world,
these  idiots didn't get their twisted way and now we can all warp our minds
and indulge in a little GTA.<br>

Basically you start the game as a small time petty criminal on
the streets of a city known as Liberty City. A crime syndicate contacts
you through your pager, mobile and public phones which are dotted around
the top down pseudo 3D play area. Jobs ranging from murder, Grand Theft
Auto, bombings, drug dealing and protection are all on offer but it's
usually up to you if you want to take on specific jobs. Out to stop you
are of course the police and other mobsters and some of the missions can
be incredibly tricky to get right. As you make more money you move on to
other cities and other missions - working for the mob in Liberty City (New
York), the Chinese Tongs and a Mexican weirdo in San Andreas (San Francisco)
and a crooked Drug Squad cop and the Rastas in Vice City (Miami).<br>

Generally quite basic although the range of landscapes throughout
the three cities is quite diverse - Liberty City is one big sprawling and
congested slum, San Andreas is a green and pleasant bay city with it's own
Golden Gate bridge and Vice city has Latin American inner barrios through
residential and commercial districts to the stupidly rich Vice Shores beach
area. There are different vehicles for you to steal from buses and taxis
to Ferrari like sportscars and motorbikes. All the vehicles show damage
where you've had a bump or where you've driven straight through a police
roadblock. The people of the city all look alike with differing colours of
clothes although if you see someone in a black suit then that usually means
trouble.<br>

 The sounds of the city have actually been recorded onto the CD as a
playable track with cars starting, general traffic sounds and horns etc and
people cry out all kinds of curses and screams when you start a gun fight
down town. The car sounds themselves are a little disappointing but they
all differ from vehicle to vehicle such as the high pitched whine of a
Penetrator sports model down to the throaty rumbling and reverse beeping
of an oil tanker. Freeze, Hold it and Spread Em are all bellowed at you by
the cops and you can play the sirens on stolen police cars, ambulances and
Fire trucks to your hearts content but where the game really wins is it's
fantastic musical score. The tunes on offer are wide and varied and have
been made specially for the game.<br>

 I love this game. Even if you aren't planning on completing the
missions it's fun to grab a car and cause chaos around the city leaving a
trail of burning cars and dead cops in your wake (God it's morbid). The
other great thing is the sheer range of vehicles you can steal.<br>
<P>
<P>
Heres some:
<P>
F19 - Closest thing to a Ferrari in the game.
Penetrator - Changes from city to city but very quick although fragile.
Beast GTS - For some reason the Liberty City models suck but elsewhere fast and furious.
<P>
Police Cars - Different in each city but the fastest cars in the game. Very fragile though.
              (I like the San Andreas ones best!)<br>
<P>
Buses/Coaches - Strong and sturdy and while they have low acceleration for some reason the top speed is better than most of the cars!
<P>
Jugular - Very strong and can take a few hits whilst still quite quick. Really ugly though.<br>
<P>
Impaler - Roof up in Liberty City but down elsewhere, your basic sporty car.
<P>
4x4 - Dull, slow and easily destroyed.
<P>
Portsmouth - Dirty Harry style 70s grunt mobile. Terrible handling.
<P>
Brigand - One of my faves - Sturdy and fast.
<P>
Limo - Loooong, fast and crystal handling.
<P>
Itali - Goes through a couple of incarnations but usually quite reliable.
<P>
Juggernaut - Perfect for smashing through roadblocks.
<P>
Porka - Aka Porsche. Comes in classic and turbo finish.

UP POINTS
<P>
<font Color=#4c4c4c>
<ol>
<LI>
<LI>The music. The car stereo idea playing different stations with jingles and even a chart countdown is totally inspired.
<P>
<LI>Completely non linear. Do what you want to who you want.
<P>
<LI>The weaponry ranges from machine gun to flame throwers.
<P>
<LI>In-game surprises (And there are a few.)
<P>
<LI>The fact it was given an 18 rating instead of being watered down in  any way.
</ol>
<P>
<font color=#FF0000>
DOWN POINTS
<font Color=#4c4c4c>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> The police IQ. The cops are totally dull and run straight into fires etc. The car chases are very limited by the fact
     that the police never turn corners withour slowing down to a crawl.
<P>
<LI> The frame rate. Sometimes things slow right down to a crawl and it does crash now and again.
<P>
<LI>Some of the missions are next to impossible.
</OL>
