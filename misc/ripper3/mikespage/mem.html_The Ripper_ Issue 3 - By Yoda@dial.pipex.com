<CENTER>I wrote this story a couple of years back and thought it might be an
okay proposition to write it up in the Ripper over a few issues in parts.
Hope you enjoy it.</CENTER>

Fuzzy shapes to the left and right.  He could hear a droning sort of noise
which he guessed to be a helicopter's spinning blades.  He felt himself rise
and as the pain once again flooded his system, he blacked out.
 His eyes opened slightly and he saw ghostly white figures moving around
him.  The fierce glare of an overhead light made him turn his head.  Was
this heaven or something?  Then it came to him.  It was a hospital.  He
vaguely remembered the mission he had been on.  He vaguely remembered the
ambush and many men and friends getting mown down by enemy guns.  Then he
had been hit.  A sudden wave of panic swept over him and he mentally tried
to remember where he had been hit.  Was he hit bad?  Was he dying?  All of
this was to much for his exhausted brain and he was plunged into merciful
darkness for the third time.<BR>

"Kyle...Hey Kyle, you feeling okay?"  The words seemed to travel around
inside Corporal Kyle Mason's head before registering and slowly he opened
his eyes.  He blinked a few times as his eyes got  used to the light.
Surprisingly, the light seemed to dim and he no longer needed to blink. "You
feeling all right, buddy?" Came the voice again.  "You've been out for three
weeks."  Three weeks!  Where was he?  Looking around, he saw two men sitting
by his bed, one wearing army fatigues whilst the other was dressed in the
white clothes of a doctor.  "Where..Where am I?" He managed to grunt and the
doctor spoke up.  "You're at Reztek hospital, Corporal Mason.  You were shot
eight times in an ambush three weeks ago and were delivered here by
helicopter." Reztek?  They were a multi-million dollar scientific set up.
What in the name of Christ was he doing here?  The doctor answered his
question before he asked it.  "We saved your life through a week of
intensive surgery.  Much of you was completely useless such as your left
eye, one of your lungs and your heart.We tried to save your right hand but
unfortunately we lost that as well."  It took a moment for all of this to
sink in.  If his heart and lungs were useless why was he still alive?  And
why could he see his right hand through his left eye?  The doctor sounded
quite amused at Mason's bewildered stare.  "Your hand is now a
servo-mechanism capable of many different things, your heart and lungs are
all mechanised so there's no chance of lung cancer or heart disease there
and your eye is the best part.  It is now a mini-computer with files on
every known enemy group on the planet, every weapon used anywhere, all
vehicles and how to drive them, language processors, thermal, infra red and
zoom functions, a special targeting system, damage reports on yourself, any
vehicle you happen to be using and weapons you have, a radar with a range of
twenty miles, a special connection to the brain which will make you freeze
completely should you need utter silence and no movement whatsoever and it
comes with a lifetime guarantee."  The other soldier chuckled.  Kyle's jaw
had dropped minutes before but there was more to come.  "As for your heart
and lungs," continued the doctor, "The heart can pump blood at any rate you
require meaning you can't get tired when running or swimming.  Speaking of
swimming, the lungs have a special capability which allows them to store
twenty minutes worth of oxygen meaning you can stay under water for that
length of time.  As for the hand, you can deliver one hell of a punch with
it!  Impressed?"  Kyle couldn't say a word.

 Four hours later, Kyle and the other soldier, Corporal Barry Short, were
sitting in the back of the truck heading back to their old HQ.  Kyle and
Barry had known each other long before the war had started in 1997.  When
Kyle had turned seventeen in that same year he had received his call up
papers and had joined the army as a simple Private in the Infantry.  One
year later, Barry had joined up too and they were put in the same unit
together.  They were both promoted after a battle in which the two of them
played a big part. Kyle had never been a great fan of the Japanese and when
they decided to invade China he liked them even less.  The Japs flowed
across Asia, helped by their Russian and Italian allies and soon they
occupied the whole world excluding North and South America, Ireland, Britain
and most of France.  In the vain attempt to hold the enemy back, the
Americans, Brits and French had thousands of troops on the front lines in
France.  That's where Kyle and Barry were heading back to.
 Suddenly there was a colossal explosion outside and a scream as a jet
passed overhead.  The truck driver stuck his head through a small window at
the front of the truck and shouted back to Kyle and Barry; "Ambush! Everyone
out quickly!" The three troops that were in the back of the truck with Kyle
and Barry dove out, dashing for the nearest cover.  The two Corporals
followed suit, only to be flung through the air as a grenade exploded beside
them.  Kyle drew his M.18 Mark IV Personal MGF, Machine Gun and Flamer, and
using his now exceedingly powerful new hand, pulled the stunned Barry Short
to the safety of some trees.  "Now to try out this new eye and see what
tricks it can do." He muttered, clicking the safety off of his M.18.
<P>
Concentrating, he used his mind to click a Threat Identifier onto the main
screen of his left eye.  The eye immediately turned in it's socket so that
he was looking at a clump of trees, and a quick thermal check proved the
fact that six men were hiding in the cover of the aforementioned evergreens.
Using the flamer function on his M.18, he let loose a long burst of flame
that set the trees up in flames.  Three men stumbled from the trees,
engulfed in flames trying vainly to swat out the fires which soon devoured
them.  The other three enemy troops ran into the open and Kyle's eye
targeting system easily picked out the men who he easily finished off with a
burst of fire from his machine gun.  By this time Barry had recovered from
the initial shock of the grenade blast and was by Kyle's side, M.18 drawn.
 "Leave any for me?" He questioned, half jokingly.
"Yeah." Replied Kyle, "There are about twelve of them heading towards us
through those trees to the west while the plane that attacked the column is
coming in for another strafing session." He knew this thanks to the thermal
and radar functions of his eye.  The column itself looked to be pretty much
decimated, reduced from five trucks and two tanks to two trucks.  Kyle
couldn't see any signs of friendly troops.  The three guys that had been in
the truck with Barry and Kyle stumbled into the road, weapons drawn, looking
for cover. Suddenly, the troops Kyle had detected burst into the clearing,
Israeli rebels working with the Japanese, and howled with delight, sensing
the oncoming massacre. The rebels opened fire with their old Russian weaponry
and one of the British soldiers, flung his hands up in the air as he was
gunned down.  The second soldier raised his M.18, firing it wildly.  He hit
two of the rebels before falling dead into a puddle of his own blood. Just
as the third Brit dived into the bushes Kyle and Barry were in and the two
Corporals opened fire on the marauding Israelis.  Five of them dropped to
the ground before the other five managed to take cover.

Private Sean Cameron
cowered behind a tree as bullets lashed the wooded area the three Scots were
hiding in.  Even the usually calm and collected Barry Short was feeling
slightly compromised.  Kyle however, spoke in an impermeable tone, calmed by
his electronic heart which was keeping him totally under control.  "Those
troops are firing wildly," He assured Barry and Sean.  "They can't see us."
He slammed a new mag into his M.18 and using his thermal and zoom targeting
eye functions, easily spotted the rebels.  He emptied the magazine into
their position and three guns stopped firing. "The other two are behind
trees." He muttered, more to himself than to the two men beside him.
Unclipping a grenade from his belt, he flung it with all the power he could
muster in the air.  It arced into the bushes and a gruff voice shouted a
warning at the other side of the road before being drowned out by a large
explosion that gutted the small area.  Kyle nodded happily.  His new found
body parts were a success!  Sean Cameron cheered and walked out of the trees
and Kyle and Barry were about to follow suit when a screaming roar pierced
the air.  Sean turned in horror to see the jet fighter had returned and a
swift burst of fire from the aircraft's 20mm cannon reduced the private to a
bloody puddle in the road.  Kyle and Barry ducked back into the bushes,
praying they hadn't been seen and thankfully, after destroying the last two
trucks, the jet flew off in search of more targets. Picking themselves up,
the two troopers started the long walk back to the front.
