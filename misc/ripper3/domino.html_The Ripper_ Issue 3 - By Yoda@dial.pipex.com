<CENTER><H2>Hello There! How are all my friends Today?</H2></CENTER>

Well this month I have a very important Question to ask you all!<br>

First! Let me explain. The complicated life that you Humans weave for yourselves,it can be A bit confusing for us Dalmations!<br>
<P>
<P>
Now! The other day, I noticed that the back door to my house was open, So I thought to myself OH HO! Here we go!
and I ran down the steps, Into the garden and assumed my Begging position at the fence.<br>
<P>
<CENTER><I>Now our neighbour (Jean) Is always good for the odd Chockie Bickie,</I></CENTER>
<P>
So I put on my <I>"Poor hungry Me, Face"</I> And sat there! Well! The next thing old Grumble Guts (My Master) comes out<BR>
<P>

And says "You've No Chance Domino! Jeans away to Do Her JOBBIE!" That's OK! I thought, It shouldn't take her to long
She's probably gone over to the hill, That I always go to! But NO! 4 hours I sat there and still she Wasn´t back!
The strange thing was, That when I went for MY walk And ran up to the top of the hill, There was still no sign of her!
I even checked out the long grass incase she was squatting there! Just to make things even more complicated,
My brother Gavin <BR>
<I>( Well he's my masters Son, Really)</I> He Disappeared! From what I can gather, He got a new JOBBIE
And I take it he must have gone to get RID of it! Cause he was away most of the day! In fact when he got home,
He looked Knackered and his eyes were all red,<BR>
<P>
I think he must have been Straining himself! Cause I get like that if I eat Dry food! So you see my life is simple,<BR>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Go for a walk
<LI>Find a Hummock
<LI>Have a Dump
<LI>Go home!

So why do you humans, Disappear for hours at a time When you go to do YOUR JOBBIES? Answers on a Postcard Please!<BR>
