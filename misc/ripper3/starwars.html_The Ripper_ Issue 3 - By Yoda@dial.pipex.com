<P>
<P>
This is a Great re-vamp of the film that now sets the standards of sci-fi films!<br>
this is the re release of the first films, (or last 3 chapters!) but this time George Lucas,<BR>
has tweeked what thay said was UN-tweekable! All the explosions, sounds, and sound track are the way He first wanted them.<BR>
<P>
He even found time to add bits to them that was not posable to do in the first film!<Br>
like the computer generated Jaba the Hut, in the first one, And the computer animated band in "Jedi"<br>
It REALY was like watching them for the first time!
<P>
THE PLOT - Me thinks you should know!
<P>
