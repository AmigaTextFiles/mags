<CENTER>"THE RIPPER" got started when I was bored out of my head and had nothing to do. </CENTER>
<CENTER>I realised that there was a lot of other disk magazines about so I decided to have a crack at it myself.</CENTER>
<CENTER>So Ithen answerd an addvert, asking for articles for a new mag. after the first relece,</Center>
<CENTER>was the only one still doing any of the work! (I still am)</CENTER>
<CENTER>This disk mag may be totally crap to you but <H1><B><Font Color=#FF0000>I don`t care!!</H1></B</CENTER>
<Font Color=#FFFFFF>
<CENTER>This is a mag FOR the Amiga community!,</CENTER>

By that means, If you have somthing that you want to say, or express & Share then send it to us<br>
Or if you have some work, Adverts OR Notices send them in too and they will be included in the next Issue,<BR>
