<centre>    Ian doesn`t (as far as I know) have much PD (except for the disks that       </centre>
<centre>he got from me) and so doesn`t really swap PD software. He does however like     </centre>
<centre>writing to people so if your interested in talking Amiga then write him a        </centre>
<centre>letter. I`m sure he`ll be pleased to receive it.                                 </centre>

<P>
<centre>     Well, I have a few more contacts that I swap with but they haven`t              </centre>

<centre>why not send me a catalogue disk too so I can swap software with you?                </centre>
