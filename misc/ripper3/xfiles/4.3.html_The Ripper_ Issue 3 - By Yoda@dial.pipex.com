        Scully is summond to Skinner's office to meet a member of the Centre<BR>
   for Disease Control (CDC), regarding the disappearence of four young<BR>
   African-American. One was found on a construction site, but he looks like<BR>
   an albino and has no trace of pigment. The CDC claims it's a fatal<BR>
   disease and not a crime. Mulder takes the evidence to Agent Pendrell, who<BR>
   discovers asbestos fibres and a rare passion flower found only in western<BR>
   Africa, that can act as a cortical depressant, with numbing qaulities,<BR>
   and in large enough doses, can kill. Scully also finds that the victim's<BR>
   pituitary gland is badly damaged. <BR>
