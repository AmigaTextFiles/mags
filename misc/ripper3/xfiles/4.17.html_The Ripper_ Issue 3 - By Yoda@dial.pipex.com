        Writers:  Chris Carter & Frank Spotnitz<BR>
        Director: Rob Bowman<BR>
        Location: Albany, New York<BR>
        After encountering a blinding beam of light at 29,000 feet, a<BR>
   commercial jet, Flight 549, plunges to the ground, killing all on board,<BR>
   including an old friend of the agents, Max Fenig  <A HREF="1.9.html">[Fallen Angel]</A>. Max's<BR>
   sister mets up with Mulder and Scully and claims that Max was carrying a<BR>
   package that would reveal evidence of a cover up regarding the existence<BR>
   of UFOs. The evidence was so revealing that the government would kill to<BR>
   get it back, or to prevent anyone who stole it from leaking the<BR>
   information. So the question is, was the crash of Flight 549 caused by a<BR>
   mechanical failure, a human error, or a more sinister cause? Mulder<BR>
   suspects that the Military may have shot down the plane to keep Fenig<BR>
   from revealing his findings. But Mulder will find evidence of a more<BR>
   startling nature, that will reveal the Military's true target.<BR>
