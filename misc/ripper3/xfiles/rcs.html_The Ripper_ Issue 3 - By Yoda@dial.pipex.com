   "<I>Cigarette Smoking Man</I>" or "<I>Cancer Man</I>" (William B. Davis) is another<BR>
mysterious individual who, like <I>Deep Throat</I>, appears to be a higher-up<BR>
government official with some power, possably CIA. He also keeps a silent<BR>
watch on the proceedings in  <A HREF="Superiors.html">Section Chief Scott Blevins</A>' and<BR>
 <A HREF="Superiors.html">Assistant Director Walter S. Skinners</A>'  offices, buries vital evidence in a<BR>
secret Pentagon storage room, and was very well acquainted, and an apparent<BR>
former partner, with Mulder's father, <I>William Mulder</I>. He is never seen<BR>
without a lit cigarette (His brand is Morley's).<BR>
   There is very little personal information known about him. He lives<BR>
alone at 900 West Georgia Street, and has no family and was born on 20th<BR>
August 1940 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana<BR>

   "<I>Deep Throat</I>" (Jerry Hardin) is a mysterious individual believed to be<BR>
some sort of higher-up government official. Mulder can apparently contact<BR>
him via a blue light shining from his apartment window; DT calls Mulder and<BR>
signals him with a series of clicks.The method of choosing a meeting place<BR>
has not been determined. He claims that he used to work for the CIA during<BR>
the Vietnam war, and belonged to a organisation which he claims were guilty<BR>
of "heinous crimes against man". It is apparently his goal to bring down<BR>
this same organisation through the acts of Mulder and Scully. He appears to<BR>
have been exterminated in the episode  <A HREF="1.23.html">The Erlenmeyer Flask</A>.<BR>
   Deep Throat is named after the US government insider from the Watergate<BR>
scandal.<BR>

   "<I>Mr. X</I>" (Steve Williams) is yet another mysterious individual (how many<BR>
mysterious individuals can you, have in one show!!?!) believed to be some<BR>
sort of higher-up government official. He can be contacted via an X taped on<BR>
a window. The method of choosing a meeting place has, as with "<I>Deep Throat</I>",<BR>
not been determined. On more than one one occasion, he has refused to help<BR>
Mulder and Scully, and will not help them if he sees a risk to himself. He<BR>
appears to have been exterminated in the episode  <A HREF="4.1.html">Herrenvolk</A>.<BR>

   "<I>The Lone Gunmen</I>" AKA <I>Byers, Fohike</I> and <I>Langly</I> (Bruce Harwood, Tom<BR>
Braidwood, Dean Haglund) are a group that are responsable for "The Lone<BR>
Gunman", a conspiracy newsletter, named after the alleged second assassin in<BR>
the Kennedy shooting. They provide Mulder with help and information, thanks<BR>
to there variety of sources.<BR>
   Briers is well-dressed in a suit and trimmed beard, and is an expert in<BR>
Information systems. Frohike, dresses casually, is a expert in photography<BR>
and special operations, and has a crush on Scully. Langly has long, blonde,<BR>
hair, glasses, and is usually dressed in jeans and a T-shirt advertising<BR>
some obscure American rock band, and specialises in communications.<BR>

   "<I>Agent Alex Krycek</I>" (Nicholas Lea) was assign as Mulder's assistant after<BR>
Scully's reassignment and abduction. It later transpired that he is a hench<BR>
man of the <I>Cigarette Smoking Man</I>. Was possessed by an alien entity in the<BR>
episode  <A HREF="3.16.html">Apocrypha</A>, and appears to be trapped in a missile<BR>
silo. He later reappears, and is captured by Mulder. The two of them travel<BR>
to Russia, and Krycek appears to be helping Mulder when they are captured<BR>
(See  <A HREF="4.8.html">Tunguska</A>) but does, in fact, end up betraying him.<BR>

   "<I>The Conspiracy</I>" or "<I>The Elders</I>" are a group of strange, but powerful<BR>
men, from a variety of countries around the world. Their exact possitions<BR>
(Military? Government?) and level of influence is unknown, but is presumed<BR>
to be of a very high level. The only members that are known of are a man<BR>
simply known as the <I>Well-Manicured Man</I>, another with a Russian accent, and<BR>
the <I>Cigarette Smoking Man</I>.<BR>
   They meet regularly at West 46th Street, New York. The telephone company<BR>
deny the existence of any phone number for this address, although one<BR>
(5551012) did exist, but has since been changed.<BR>
   The consortium of men has existed since the second world war, where they<BR>
where respomsible for the pardoning, and acquisition of German scientist to<BR>
participate in <I>'Operation Paper Clip'</I>. This operation used American citizens<BR>
as experimental subjects for tests with alien DNA.<BR>
   They are also responsible for the cataloging of American citizens under<BR>
the pretence of smallpox innoculations, but really where taking tissue<BR>
samples for cataloging. The records where stored in an underground mine.<BR>
Agent Mulder's father helped collect the data, but objected to it when he<BR>
found out there real purpose. It is rumoured that Samantha was taken to<BR>
ensure that he didn't reveal his knowledge (See  <A HREF="2.25.html">Anasazi</A>).<BR>
   They are also appear to be responsible, with the help of Doctor Ishimaru,<BR>
to be the ones responsible for the abduction of agent Scully, whoe continued<BR>
the <I>'Operation Paper Clip'</I> experiments right up to 1974 (See  <A HREF="3.9.html">Nisei</A>).<BR>
<BR>
   <STRONG>The Mulders</STRONG><BR>
   Mulder sister, Samantha Ann, was abdusted at the age of eight, apparently<BR>
by aliens. She reappears during an investigation ( <A HREF="2.14.html">Colony</A>), but it<BR>
later transpires that it is not her, but instead someone/-thing resembles<BR>
her.<BR>
  His Father, William, was formerly with the State Department, and was<BR>
assassinated by <I>Agent Alex Krycek</I> (See  <A HREF="2.25.html">Anasazi</A>). He was a former associate<BR>
of the <I>Cigarette Smoking Man</I>.<BR>
  His mother is devorced from William, and appears to mean something to the<BR>
<I>Cigarette Smoking Man</I>, after he orders a strange alien bounty hunter to use<BR>
his powers to heal her (See  <A HREF="4.1.html">Herrenvolk</A>).<BR>
<BR>
   <STRONG>The Scullys</STRONG><BR>
   Her father, Captian William Mulder of the US Navy, died suddenly in 1993.<BR>
   Her mother, Margaret, also gave birth to 3 other children, Dana's<BR>
brothers, William Jr. and Charles, and an older sister, Melissa.<BR>
   Melissa is a great believer in New Age philosophies, and was killed by<BR>
Louis Cardinale and <I>Alex Krycek</I>, mistakenly believing they had shot Scully.<BR>
