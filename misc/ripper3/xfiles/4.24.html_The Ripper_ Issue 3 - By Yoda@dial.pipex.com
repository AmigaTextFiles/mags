        Scully is called to Mulder's apartment, only to find that he's<BR>
   apparently commited suicide. She appears before a committee of FBI<BR>
   members to "report on the illegitimacy of Agent Mulder's work". She<BR>
   informs that she believes that Mulder was a victim of his own false<BR>
   beliefs. Mulder's latest piece of evidence had come from a Doctor<BR>
   Arlinsky at the Smithsonien Institute, who claims to have found the<BR>
   remains of an alien preserved in a glacier for the last 200 years. He<BR>
   wanted to Mulder to help him get it out so that it could be authenticated<BR>
   with out the wrong people getting their hands on it. Scully say's that<BR>
   she will go to the Yukon with Mulder, not telling him that her cancer has<BR>
   entered a terminal stage.<BR>
