        Writers:  Glen Morgan & James Wong<BR>
        Director: Harry Longstreet<BR>
        Location: Baltimore, Maryland<BR>
        A gruesome murder without motive, clear M.O., or point of entry<BR>
     bears resemblance to an X-File killer. However, the X-File cases took<BR>
     place in 1933 and 1963. Mulder and Scully attempt to track down and<BR>
     stop this century old killer.<BR>
      When Eugene Tooms is released based on psychiatric re-evaluation and<BR>
     lack of evidence, Mulder sets out to prevent Tooms from killing for the<BR>
     fifth and final liver he needs, while Scully attempts to locate more<BR>
     definitive evidence. Both tasks made more difficult by their superiors<BR>
     insistence that they work by the book.<BR>
