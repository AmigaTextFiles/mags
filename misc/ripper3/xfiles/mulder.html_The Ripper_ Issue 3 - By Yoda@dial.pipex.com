<FONT size=4 color=#000000>Background-Fox Mulder</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
   Agent Fox William Mulder, born on October 13, 1961, is an Oxford-trained<BR>
psychologist with a photographic memory, is one of the FBI Violent Crimes<BR>
division's best agents, although he is in disfavour with not only his<BR>
superiors but also his colleagues (He has little dealings with other agents,<BR>
except for Agent Scully) because of his interest in the Bureau's X-Files. He<BR>
stumbled upon these Files, dealing with unexplained phenomena, during his<BR>
first three years with the Bureau, as a crack analyst in the Bureau's<BR>
behavioural sciences department.<BR>
    His fascination with the paranormal stems from a childhood incident -<BR>
his sister Samantha disappeared from their home in Chilmark, Mass. when he<BR>
was 12 and she was 8. Mulder claims she was abducted by aliens; during<BR>
regressions he recalled hearing his sister's cries for help, and a bright<BR>
light which kept him paralysed and told him that his sister would be all<BR>
right.<BR>
    Mulder's early meteoric rise at the Bureau has enabled him to make<BR>
high-placed friends in Congress. These contacts keep him from retribution<BR>
from higher-ups, although they have assigned him a partner, with the tacit<BR>
idea of discrediting what he does so that he can be dismissed. However,<BR>
Mulder picked up a somewhat vacillating ally in a mysterious covert<BR>
individual known as Deep Throat. At the end of Season 1, <I>The X-Files</I><BR>
division has been shut down and Mulder is to be reassigned.<BR>
    Mulder is known around the Bureau by the nickname of "Spooky" because of<BR>
his interest in paranormal phenomena. "He is considered a loose cannon, a<BR>
person who is maybe wasting time and money, and also his expertise, on an<BR>
area the Bureau thinks has very little value." Due to an incident on one of<BR>
his first Bureau assignments (a fellow agent was killed), he eschews<BR>
following investigations "by the book," opting instead for his own instincts<BR>
and methods. We believe Mulder doesn't "have a life," as we have seen<BR>
nothing of his off-duty activities. However, some of this may stem from a<BR>
relationship he had at Oxford ten years ago with a woman who is now with<BR>
Scotland Yard (Phoebe Green). He apparently was in love with her, but she<BR>
not with him.<BR>
    Mulder has a fear of fire, which may have been conquered during his<BR>
rescue of the children of British MP Sir Malcolm Marsden (who also happened<BR>
to be Phoebe's latest fling). He is also a fan of the National Aeronautics<BR>
and Space Administration (NASA). He has a habit of unshelling and eating<BR>
shelled sunflower seeds.<BR>
    Mulder enjoys wearing wild ties to work, and seems to be a New York<BR>
Knicks and Wahington Redskins fan. He appears to had a fondness for classic<BR>
rock and classic science fiction movies. There are "hints" that Mulder has<BR>
an interest in pornography -- in one episode, we see Mulder looking at the<BR>
centerfold of some "men's magazine" talking about how the woman claims she<BR>
was abducted by aliens; in another episode Scully remarks that she hadn't<BR>
seen Mulder that excited since she caught him going through the Adult Video<BR>
News, and once found evidence inbetween <I>Playboy</I>'s Miss April and arcticle on<BR>
Women of the Ivy League, and apparently has a subscription to <I>Celebrity Skin</I><BR>
and <I>Playboy</I>, and often contributes articals to <I>Adult Video News</I><BR>
under the pseudonim of MF Luder.<BR>
    As a psychologist, he favours using hypnotic regression as a<BR>
psychological healing tool, and hates the unnecessary use of medication.<BR>
    His strange beliefs have earned him the nickname "Spooky".<BR>
