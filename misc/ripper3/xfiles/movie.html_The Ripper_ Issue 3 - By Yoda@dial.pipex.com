<FONT size=4 color=#000000>X-Files</I> Movie</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
   The details of the whens, wheres and hows of <I>The X-Files</I> movie are a<BR>
little sketchy at the moment.  <A HREF="carter.html">Chris Carter</A> has said that the script is<BR>
almost written, and that shooting should start in June 1997, with the film<BR>
to be released arround May 1998, after the showing of the fifth series.<BR>
<BR>
   Details of the movie are being kept very close to Fox's and Carter's<BR>
chest. The only things knwon are that it will be directed by regular <I>X-Files</I><BR>
Director Rob Bowman, and that there is one confirmed 'Guest Star', Oscar<BR>
winner Martin Landau who will play a character called 'Mr. Farber', although<BR>
what part 'Mr. Farber' will play in the film is unknown. Another Oscar star,<BR>
Armin Mueller Stahl, who won an Oscar for the movie 'Shine' will also be<BR>
playing a Guest Star roll.<BR>
   Story wise, the film will revolve around Mulder and Scully investigating<BR>
the bombing of a Dallas office building, but as all <I>X-Files</I> storys, there<BR>
will be twist in the tale, no doubt.<BR>
<BR>
   At had been said in the Italian press that  <A HREF="duchovny.html">David Duchovny</A> and<BR>
 <A HREF="anderson.html">Gillian Anderson</A> wouldn't be playing Mulder and Scully in the movie, due to<BR>
the fact that big name stars would prove a greater pull to non-X-Philes, and<BR>
that the agents where going to be played be Richard Gere and Jodie Foster!<BR>
