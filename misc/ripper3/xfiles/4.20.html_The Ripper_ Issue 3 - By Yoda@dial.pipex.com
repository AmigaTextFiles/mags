        Location: West Virginia<BR>
        Mulder and Scully investigate a small West Virginia town which is<BR>
   experiencing a spate of babies being born with tails. Scully claims this<BR>
   is not uncommon and is surgically treatable, but even she agrees that<BR>
   such a small community have five born a few months is quite a lot. When<BR>
   the first mother, a single parent, that they interview claims that the<BR>
   father is from another planet, even Mulder is suprised. She claims that<BR>
   he came round the house and that nature just followed it's course.<BR>
   Following DNA testing on the other babies, it is revealed that they all<BR>
   share the same father, and that all the mothers where receiving fertility<BR>
   treatment from the same doctor, leading them to an obvious suspect,<BR>
   untill Mulder notices that one of the maintenance men has a scar at the<BR>
   base of his spine, similar to that of someone who'd had an operation to<BR>
   remove a tail.<BR>
