        When a women is seen caught in the mechanical systems of a bowling<BR>
   alley, bleeding and trying to speak, the manager runs for help. As soon<BR>
   as he's outside the door, he runs into the police standing around a body.<BR>
   When the manager sees the body, he sees that it's the some women who was<BR>
   inside, only dead with her throat slashed. Mulder and Scully go to<BR>
   investigate, this being the third sighting and murder of a women in three<BR>
   weeks. Mulder offers a connection with death omens and disembodied souls.<BR>
   One of the calls about the murders has come from a psychiatric hospital,<BR>
   leading Mulder to investigate a man called Harold. Despite being autistic,<BR>
   he has a job at the bowling alley. He becomes distraught when Mulder<BR>
   questions him about ghosts, and, whilst in the Ladies toilets, Scully<BR>
