        Scully is annoyed with Mulder after he dragged he to San Joaquin<BR>
   Valley in California to get her to examine what he discribes as an<BR>
   unexplained death, but is infact only the rotting corpse of a goat. But<BR>
   Mulder is fascinated when he sees reports that the goat and a woman who<BR>
   was also in the field where killed in a very strange manner - a bright<BR>
   flash of light was seen, closely followed by a yellow rain. After the<BR>
   rain, the bodies were found partially eaten away. The local workers<BR>
   believe it was the work of El Chupacabra, The Goatsucker, a creature<BR>
   that appears in Mexican Folk law. Scully is amazed that, upon performing<BR>
   an autopsy on the woman, the body is covered with a strange fungal<BR>
   growth, leading her to believe that a highly contagious disease is at<BR>
   work.<BR>
