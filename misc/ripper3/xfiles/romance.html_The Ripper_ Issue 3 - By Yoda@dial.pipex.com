<BR>
   There will be no romance between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.<BR>
   Everyone readily admits that there is some attraction, a "sexual<BR>
tension," between the characters. However, neither series creator Chris<BR>
Carter, nor actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, nor most X-Philes,<BR>
want a full-blown romance to develop.<BR>
   Chris Carter, the producer, "firmly believes that a series can be <BR>
'ruined' if the characters cross the boundaries of sexual tension." <BR>
   Anderson says, "I don't want that to happen, David doesn't want that to<BR>
happen, [Chris Carter] I don't think wants that to happen. The show's not<BR>
about intimacy between us; it would be a huge mistake to make it about that.<BR>
Both of our characters are single-minded about our work and respectful<BR>
enough not to complicate it in any way. We [eventually] warm up to each<BR>
other, and there are times when there's more sexual tension than others, but<BR>
it's not going to be a romantic relationship."<BR>
   Duchovny's viewpoint: "Having a friendship and a professional working<BR>
relationship with a woman is much more interesting...It's very easy to just<BR>
jump into bed. That doesn't take much imagination."<BR>
   So: don't even think about it!<BR>
