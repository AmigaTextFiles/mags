        Mulder takes Scully to a meeting with a Russian who says that he is<BR>
   a former engineer with copies of a secret report on the analysis of<BR>
   downed UFOs that he is willing to sell to Mulder. Scully doesn't believe<BR>
   the man's claims, but still goes along with Mulder's plan to go the<BR>
   Philadelphian Russian community to check the man's claims whilst he<BR>
   takes a weeks forced holiday. Scully shocks Mulder when she asks why she<BR>
   was never given a desk in the office, and that she always comes second<BR>
   to Mulder's beliefs. When she gets to Philadelphia, she shadows a<BR>
   Russian who leads her to Comrade Svo's tattoo parlour. There she meets<BR>
   Ed Jerse, who celebrated a change in his life by getting a tattoo of a<BR>
   woman with the words 'Never Again' next to it done at Comrade Svo's. He<BR>
   has come back to complain about his tattoo, but ends up asking Scully<BR>
   out on a date. But what Ed hasn't revealed is that his tattoo talks to<BR>
   him, and urges him to do things, like kill his neighbour.<BR>
