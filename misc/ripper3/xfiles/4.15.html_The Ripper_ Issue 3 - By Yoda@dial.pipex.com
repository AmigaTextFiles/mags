        After Issac Luria, a shopkeeper in a Hasidic Jewish communtity, was<BR>
   killed viciously, rumours that he has risen from the dead begin to prout<BR>
   up when one of the boys that killed him is found strangled with Luria's<BR>
   fingerprints on his throat. Scully believes that it's the work of a<BR>
   member of the community trying to get justice, whilst Mulder believes<BR>
   that there is something in some ancient texts on the subject of animating<BR>
   an artifical man.<BR>
