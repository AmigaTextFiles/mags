        After a space shuttle launch is aborted and evidence of some bizarre<BR>
     sabotage is found, a NASA worker asks Mulder and Scully to take a look<BR>
     around. Meanwhile, the former astronaut who is in charge of the<BR>
     mission is apparently haunted by something he encountered during a<BR>
     spacewalk on a previous mission.<BR>
