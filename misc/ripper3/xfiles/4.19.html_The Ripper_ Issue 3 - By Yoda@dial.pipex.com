        Professor Jason Nichols and Grad Student Lucas Menand are interupted<BR>
   in the middle of an arguement by an old man who says that Nichols must<BR>
   stop Menand from being killed in a road accident in a couple of minutes<BR>
   of time. After the old man has bean lead away by campus police, Nichols<BR>
   is shocked to see Menand about to be run over by a bus whilst he is<BR>
   distracted picking up some books that he has dropped. Nichols ends up in<BR>
   court after the driver of the bus interprets Nichols attempts at saving<BR>
   the student as an attempt to push him in front of the bus. Nichols' cases<BR>
   isn't helped by the fact that he admits the reason for the arguement was<BR>
   that Lucas was going to go public over a claim that Nichols had falsified<BR>
   data on a research grant application form. The police officer did report<BR>
   picking up the old man, but his body is later found frozen solid outside<BR>
   his car, with the old man missing.<BR>
