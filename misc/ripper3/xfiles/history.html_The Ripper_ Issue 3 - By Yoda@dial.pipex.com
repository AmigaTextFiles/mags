                                 <STRONG>Stuff To Do</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
*  Add Biographies on actors who play recurring characters, IE. Steven<BR>
  Williams, Mitch Pileggi, etc.<BR>
<BR>
*  Add a few more general pics (possably episode pics (unlikely)).<BR>
<BR>
*  Possibly add data on related programs (<I>Millenium, Space:Above and<BR>
  Beyond</I>), depending on data availability, any help would be grateful.<BR>
<BR>
*  HTML version, so I can stick in more pictures and stuff (May happen, may<BR>
  not, depend on me learning HTML language).<BR>
<BR>
*  Anything else I missed (Any suggestions will be welcome).<BR>
<BR>
*  May do Babylon 5 guide, depending on whether I have the Data/Pics/Time.<BR>
