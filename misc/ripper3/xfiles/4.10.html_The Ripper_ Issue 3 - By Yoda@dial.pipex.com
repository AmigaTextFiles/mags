        Mulder experience strange dreams three night running, each one<BR>
   involving finding a young girl. After the third, he takes a forensic<BR>
   team to site in his dream. They dig up the body of the girl in Mulder's<BR>
   dreams, a heart shaped piece of cloth cut from her dress. Mulder<BR>
   recognises this as the MO of a killer, John Lee Roche, whom he helped<BR>
   put away back in 1990, for the murder of thirteen, or, as it now<BR>
   appears, fourteen young girls. Each time, Roche killed, he would have<BR>
   previously visited the home of his victims, under the disguise of a<BR>
   vaccuum cleaner salesman, returning later to kidnap the young girls he<BR>
   had seen their. After each murder, he would cut a heart shaped piece of<BR>
   cloth from the clothes of his victim. When it is found out that the girl<BR>
   went missing in 1975, Mulder finds out that Roche started killing<BR>
   earlier than he thought. Mulder becomes frantic to try to find Roche<BR>
   trophies, to find out just how many he did kill.<BR>
