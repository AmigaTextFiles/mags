<FONT size=4 color=#000000>Background - Gillian Anderson</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
    Gillian Leigh Anderson, 5' 3" tall with naturally ash-blonde coloured<BR>
hair, was born on August 9th, 1970 in Chicago, Illinois. She was raised in<BR>
Puerto Rico (0-2 years old), in the North London suburb of Crouch End whilst<BR>
her father attended the London Film School and her mother worked for the<BR>
Daily Mirror newspaper (2-10 years old), and then in Grand Rapids, Michegan.<BR>
She was an only child until the age of 13, claiming to be 'withdrawn' and<BR>
unpopular at school, where she was bullied by the children who thought that<BR>
she had a funny accent, until her parents had two more children (a boy and a<BR>
girl) in quick succession, which she claims only increased her alienation.<BR>
She ended up shaving her head, got a nose ring and a three foot purple<BR>
mohican. She ended up, at the age of 14, living with a broke musician who<BR>
was ten years her senior. She gave up drinking alcohol one week before her<BR>
21st birthday.<BR>
   Anderson first gained recognition as an actress for her off-Broadway<BR>
performance in Alan Ayckbourne's "Absent Friends" at the Manhattan Theater<BR>
Club, for which she won a Theatre World Award. Her love of theater began in<BR>
high school where she participated in community theater. In college,<BR>
Anderson studies with the National Theater of Great Britain at Cornell<BR>
University in Ithaca, N.Y., and then at the Goodman Theater School at<BR>
Chicago's DePaul University, where she obtained her Bachelor of Fine Arts<BR>
Degree. After her degree she moved to New York, and then, on the urgings of<BR>
a friend, to Los Angeles. There, she spent a year rehearsing, auditioning,<BR>
bit-parting in soaps or TV ads. She was on the verge of packing it in and<BR>
moving back to the east coast, when she heard about the position on <I>The<BR>
X-Files</I>, getting the role the day her last dole cheque arrived.<BR>
 She is set to star in two films out soon, namely 'The Mighty' and 'Hellcab'.<BR>
 'The Mighty', in which she co-stars with Sharon Stone and Harry Dean<BR>
Stanton, is based on the novel by Rodman Philbeck. It's filmed in Toronto,<BR>
Canada, and is about a child whose physical development stops at the age of<BR>
six.<BR>
 'Hellcab' is a low budget film made in Chicago, which is about the life of<BR>
a Chicago taxi driver on Christmas Day.<BR>
 She has split from her husband, Art Director Clyde Klotz, but has one<BR>
child, a daughter named Piper (At a party to launch the show, a psychic told<BR>
a disbeleiving Gillian she was about to get pregnant. Nine months later she<BR>
gave birth to Piper), and was voted by the readers of FHM (For Him Magazine)<BR>
as the sexiest woman in the 100 Sexist Women of 1996 pole, and 3rd in the<BR>
1997 pole.<BR>
