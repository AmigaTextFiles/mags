<FONT size=4 color=#000000>Background - David Duchovny</STRONG><BR>
    David William Duchovny (pronounced Doo-kov-nee), 6'1" tall, was born August 7, 1960<BR>
in Manhatten, New York. His parents, Amram (a publicist for the American<BR>
Jewish Committee) and Margaret, a Scot (an elementary school teacher)<BR>
divorced when he was 11. He has one brother, Daniel, and a sister, Laurie,<BR>
and a collie/terrier cross dog called Blue, after the Bob Dylan song<BR>
'Tangled Up In Blue'. He is a vegetarian and a big fan of 'Star Trek' and<BR>
'Cracker'. His favourite actor is Marlon Brando and his favourite band is<BR>
The Rolling Stones. He's crazy about sport, especially basketball, and has<BR>
included a basketball scene in his mafia film, 'Playing God'<BR>
   Duchovny, is probably best known for his memorable role as the<BR>
transvestite detective Dennis/Denise in the television series "Twin Peaks."<BR>
Duchovny graduated from Princeton University and then earned a graduate<BR>
degree in English literature at Yale University, preparing for a career as a<BR>
teacher. While at Yale studying for his Master's degree, he began commuting<BR>
to New York to study acting and was soon appearing in off-Broadway plays. In<BR>
1987, in the midst of his doctoral studies, he left Yale to pursue acting<BR>
full time. His first acting job was in advert for Lowenbrau beer, for which<BR>
he earned £5,000.<BR>
    Ever time he sees his mother, she asks whether he gets killed or appears<BR>
naked in his next project. If the answer is yes to either, she doesn't watch<BR>
it!<BR>
    Duchovny originally didn't rate <I>The X-Files</I> when he attended the<BR>
audition, stating that: "I didn't see how anyone could make a show about<BR>
aliens every week".<BR>
    Duchovny married <I>Bad Boys</I> and <I>The Naked Truth</I> star Tea Leoni on Tuesday,<BR>
6th May 1997.<BR>
    'Duchovny' is actually the Russian word for 'Spiritual'<BR>
