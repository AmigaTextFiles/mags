        Mulder and Scully check out the curious murder of a man in<BR>
     Connecticut. When they discover that another man in California was<BR>
     killed simultaneously in the same manner, the uncanny resemblance of<BR>
     the two men's daughters seems more than coincidental. So, when the<BR>
     first child disappears, the two decide to keep an eye on the remaining<BR>
     child. What they find isn't alien, but rather something much more<BR>
     familiar.<BR>
