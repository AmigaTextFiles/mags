        Location: <BR>
        Greenwood Memorial Hospital opens a new plastic surgery unit and<BR>
   experiences an increase in it business levels until a doctor, performing<BR>
   a rutine lipsouction operation, keeps removing fat from a patient until<BR>
   they die, claiming to have no control over his actions when it happened.<BR>
   All evidence points to the fact that he was abusing a prescription drug<BR>
   for years. Mulder is more concerned about what appears to be a pentagram<BR>
   burnt onto the operating theatre floor.<BR>
