<BR>
  *  Strangest present sent to Gillian from a fan was a tape containing a<BR>
Hillbilly song entitle 'Oh Scully, when will you kiss Mulder'. The strangest<BR>
present sent to Duchovny was from a female fan who sent him a jigsaw, the<BR>
picture being one of her naked. "It took me ages to finish," he said.<BR>
<BR>
  *  Carter chose the name 'Mulder' because it was his mother's maiden name.<BR>
<BR>
  *  The series is shot in entirely in Vancouver, Canada because the<BR>
exchange rate makes it 20% cheeper than filming in America, and the city<BR>
can double for almost anywhere in the US, but with less traffic.<BR>
<BR>
  *  One disadvantage of using Vancouver is that it rains too much, and if<BR>
there is a need for a desert scene, the nearest one is thousands of miles<BR>
away.<BR>
<BR>
  In  <A HREF="2.25.html">Ananszi</A>, Mulder needed to ride across the Arizona desert on a<BR>
motorbike. Film from that region had to matched with footage of Duchovny<BR>
riding past a specially painted area of a Vancouver quarry.<BR>
<BR>
  *  Clocks often read 11:21. This is reference to Dori's, Carter's wife's,<BR>
birthday, which is November 21.<BR>
<BR>
  *  After the show won the 1994 Golden Globe Best Drama award, the<BR>
previously hostile FBI opened it's doors and allowed Carter and his team to<BR>
visit the Washington head quarters. it turned out that many of the FBI's<BR>
agent were secret fans and were delighted to be taken on a tour of the<BR>
<I>X-Files<I> set in '95.<BR>
<BR>
  *  Duchovny and Anderson have appeared in an episode of <I>The Simpsons</I> entitled<BR>
<I>The Spingfield Files</I>.<BR>
<BR>
  *  The American comic, <I>Penthouse Adventure Comix</I>, published an X rated<BR>
<I>X-Files</I> cartoon strip, called <I>The Sex Files</I>. In it, British artist Les<BR>
Edwards claimed that Scully has a tatoo on her bottom saying 'Trust No One'.<BR>
<BR>
  *  Duchovny has made an uncredited guest appearence in Glen Morgan and<BR>
James Wong's series <I>Space: Above And Beyond</I>. In it he played an android<BR>
pool hustler.<BR>
<BR>
  *  Duchovny once joked that he would donate the red Speedo swimming trunks<BR>
that he wore in an episode to the Smithsonian Institute. "They can stuff it<BR>
with two plums and a gerkin and put it on display," he said.<BR>
