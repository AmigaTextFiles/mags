<BR>
  Chris Carter was born in Bellflower, Southern California in 1957. He<BR>
graduated from Cal State Long Beach University with a degree in journalism<BR>
and was stuck with the tough choice of being a writer or a beach bum. In the<BR>
end, he decided to split the difference by going to work for <I>Surfing</I><BR>
magazine. He worked there for thirteen years, ending up as senior editor by<BR>
the age of twenty-eight.<BR>
  He eventually settled down and, in 1983, married Dori Pierson. It was<BR>
Dori who encouraged him to give up surfing and take up screenwriting. His<BR>
first efforts attracted the attention of then Disney executive Jeffrey<BR>
Katzenburg, who signed him up. Carter went on to write the Disney TV movies<BR>
<I>B.R.A.T. Patrol</I> and <I>Meets The Munceys</I>.<BR>
  Whilst at Disney, he met the then-president of NBC, Brandon Tartikoff,<BR>
who brought him to the network. He wrote and produced a number of pilots, a<BR>
detective show called <I>Cameo By Night</I> and a modern-day Brady Bunch sit-com<BR>
called <I>A Brand New Life</I>, and then producing the musical comedy<BR>
series <I>Rags to Riches</I>.<BR>
  During this time, Carter wrote and produced a pilot <I>The Nanny</I>, a pilot<BR>
episode for The Disney Channel before drawing the attention of Stephen J.<BR>
Cannell Productions president Peter Roth. Roth liked a script of Carter's<BR>
called <I>Cool Culture</I>, based on his times times writing for <I>Surfing</I> magazine.<BR>
Although the script was never used, Roth wanted to use Carter for the CBS<BR>
series entitled <I>Palace Guard</I>.<BR>
  Shortly after, Roth moved over to the Fox Network as head of TV<BR>
Production. He hired several producers, including Carter, to develope new<BR>
programmes. Around this time, Carter hatched the idea for a TV show that<BR>
would utilise parts of two favourite shows from his childhood, <I>The Night<BR>
Stalker</I> and <I>The Twilight Zone</I>. That show would become <I>The X-Files</I>.<BR>
<BR>
  The idea for the show was helped along by the influence of an old friend<BR>
of Carter's, Dr. John Mack at Harvard University who was heavily into<BR>
UFOlogy.<BR>
  Instead of merely concentrating on the paranormal, though, Carter invented<BR>
the character of Scully, the sceptic, to give a balance between the the<BR>
unexplainable and the explainable.<BR>
  The pilot episode wasdelivered to Fox around Christmas '92, and, although<BR>
Carter was given the go ahead to begin production, the Fox executves had<BR>
little faith in the show, weary of the fact that shows about the paranormal<BR>
and UFO's have a bad record on TV, believing that another show, <I>Adventures<BR>
of Brisco County Jr.</I> would be there Autumn hit and that <I>The X-Files</I> would<BR>
last around half a series.<BR>
  The series went ahead, with the pilot being screened on September 10,<BR>
1993, with David Sackheim, an Emmy winner on <I>NYPD Blue</I>, as the producer and<BR>
<I>F/X</I> director Robert Mandell handling the directorial work.<BR>
  When the '93/'94 season began, it quickly became obvious that the viewing<BR>
public had little interest in <I>Brisco</I> and that the ratings for <I>The X-Files</I><BR>
were very promising, beginning the <I>X-Files</I> phenominom.<BR>
<BR>
  Carter's next foray into the Sci/Fi would be  <A HREF="mill.html">Millennium</A>, a series which<BR>
would also feature the directing and producing talent of regular <I>X-Files</I><BR>
director and Co-Producer, David Nutter, the visual effects abilities of<BR>
another <I>X-Files</I> man, Matt Beck, and the song writing talents of Mark Snow.<BR>
  The new show also has a slogan, more chilling than <I>The X-Files</I>'s "The<BR>
Truth Is Out There', or "Trust No One', namely the blunt 'Who Cares'.<BR>
