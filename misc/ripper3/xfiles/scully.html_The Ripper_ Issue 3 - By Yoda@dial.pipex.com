<FONT size=4 color=#000000>Background - Dana Scully</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
   Agent Dana Katherine Scully, born February 23, 1964 is a medical doctor<BR>
with an undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Maryland.<BR>
   She was recruited for the FBI right out of medical school, and had been<BR>
teaching at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va. She was assigned by Section<BR>
Chief Scott Blevins to be Mulder's partner in order to keep an eye on him<BR>
and determine whether he is perhaps too obsessed with <I>The X-Files</I>.<BR>
   Scully is skeptical of anything paranormal, believing that everything has<BR>
a logical, scientifically-quantified explanation. Though in most of the<BR>
cases she and Mulder have been on she has not witnessed any overt paranormal<BR>
activities, she has had four brushes with unexplainable phenomena that may<BR>
have her start questioning her beliefs. Scully has one older and one younger<BR>
brother, and an older sister. Her father died early in 1994; they were<BR>
apparently close at one time (she called him Ahab; he called her Starbuck),<BR>
but her family disapproved of her joining the Bureau. She had a yearlong<BR>
relationship with an instructor at the Academy, Jack Willis, with whom she<BR>
shared the same birthdate. She is just as much a workaholic as Mulder.<BR>
