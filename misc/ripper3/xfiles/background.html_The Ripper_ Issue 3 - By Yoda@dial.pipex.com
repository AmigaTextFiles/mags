   <I>The X-Files</I> is a television series dealing with two FBI agents,<BR>
Special Agent Fox Mulder and Special Dana Scully, in the Bureau's Violent<BR>
Crimes section. They work with the "<I>The X-Files</I>," cases that have<BR>
unexplainable elements and often involve the paranormal.<BR>
<BR>
   <I>The X-Files</I> is not based on true events or real FBI X-Files,<BR>
but the plots loosely based on news reports of unexplained events around the<BR>
world and other unexplained phenomena. The pilot does open with a note<BR>
saying that the events were based on an actual real-life story, but was put<BR>
there for effect.<BR>
<BR>
   The series idea was influenced by two TV movies, <I>Kolchak: The Night<BR>
Stalker</I> and it's sequel <I>The Night Strangler</I> and a subsequent TV<BR>
series, written by Jeff Rice. The TV series lasted for one season and was<BR>
originally broadcast in 1974-75. Other influences, according to Carter, are<BR>
a US documentary from 1976 about cop killing in Texas called <I>The Thin Blue<BR>
Line</I>, and the British TV series <I>Prime Suspect</I>.<BR>
