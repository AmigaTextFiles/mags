        Leonard Betts has an ability to detect cancers, but preferes to work<BR>
   on ambulances as a emergency medical technician. He is killed when the<BR>
   ambulance he is in is struck by a truck at a crossing, decapitating him.<BR>
   That same night his headless corpse is stolen from the hospital morge,<BR>
   along with a uniform. Scully supects theft so that the body can be sold<BR>
   for medical research, Mulder cannot see how usefull a headless body<BR>
   could be. Whilst Mulder goes to Betts' flat, Scully examines the head.<BR>
   Mulder finds the uniform and the bath full of Iodine. Scully is shoked<BR>
   when the head begins to blink, and that an examination of his head<BR>
   reveals that every cell in his brain is cancerous, meaning that he<BR>
   should have been disabled long ago. When Betts' finger prints are<BR>
   checked, they match of a man called Tanner who was killed in an accident<BR>
   six years ago.<BR>
