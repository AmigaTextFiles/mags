<CENTER>22/8/98 - Why hello and other such greetings from the deepest darkest
Green Belt town of Forfar. M'man Baz has invited me to take up a slot on
the Editorial team at this very mag and I've taken up the V generous offer.</CENTER>
<P>
<FONT size=4> As to me then: I'm an 18 year old Amiga user (although recently I've
been forced to buy a Playstation as well cause new Amiga games require
700 quids worth of new hardware to work at any sort of decent speed.)
So as you can see I'm not one of those people who blindly supports all
the new Amiga decisions - I've got a voice of my own and by the Gods am I
gonna use it.<br>
<P>
I'm a big fan of motor sports of most kinds and enjoy a
wide range of music from Green Day and Nirvana through Metallica and Megadeth
all the way down to Bentley Rythym Ace and The Prodigy.<br>
 I don't yet own a car but I'm saving up for one and I work 6 days a sodding
week at a local insurance office after leaving school at the end of 5th
year with 5 Standard Grades and 3 A Levels. Now while one of the A Levels I
got was computing, the techy world is a mystery to me and past getting DMC
by Andy Gibson to work I'm a total AmigaDOS retard.<BR>
<P>
 I run a part time PD software company called Murder Scene Productions
which has been running since late 1995 and whilst releases are quite few
and far between the ones there have been I'm fairly proud of. The first
was a disk mag called Mental Block which was fairly successful for a time
(it had quite an appeal in Ireland for some strange reason) but we ran out
of ideas and key contributors pulled out of the project. So I've worked on
this sort of thing before and it's great to get another go at it.
<P>
Well, do the right thing and send stuff to the team for inclusion - It's
not often people get a chance like this.
