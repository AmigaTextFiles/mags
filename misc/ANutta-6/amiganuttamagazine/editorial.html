Hello,<P>

Welcome to the sixth issue of the Amiga Nutta games magazine.<P>

Well, PPC is finally here and in the hands of the amiga public.  Will this
herald a new age in Amiga gaming, and push it to the heights that the PC games
are now at or will it be a complete disaster and put the Amiga in a position of
no return?  This is a question that will, for a while at least, remain
unaswered.<P>

For it to be the success that the deserves it needs more then current amiga
owners buying it.  It needs the people that are currently runnings PC's, and
even games machines such as the Plasystation and Saturn to buy it.  The only way
this is going to happen is by advertising it!  The question has to be, who is
going to do this advertising, it sure as hell won't be Phase 5 so it seems it is
all up to Amiga Inc.<P>

The other question that hangs over its head is support.  The hardware is nothing
if there is no support for it.  As things go, considering it has only just been
made available things are looking quite good in this area.  A number of
development teams have pledged their future to PowerPC, saying they will
create enhanced versions of their games for it. And almost all of them have
said they will a least add extra features for PPC owners.  However, it will stil
be quite a while before we see the first PPC only game, only then, when a game
is specificly written for it will we see how good PPC really is.  It is this
game that we need NOW to make people upgrade to PPC now and not in six or
even twelve months time.<P>

Just think, considering what programmers are doing with an 030 today, what they
will able to do with a PPC machine equiped with a super-fast 3D graphics card,
the possibilties are amazing.<P>

Anyway, returning to what happening now it looks as though you'll soon be able
to play some of them 'next generation' games soon.  First off, Shadow of the
Third moon is now finished, hopefully if all goes to plan, the game will
actually be released in the second week of November.   Also, I'm sure all of you
will be happy to now that a Foundation demo will be available to the public by
the beginning of November.  As for the Diversia demo, this has already been
released - however, only to interested publishers.  You'll not be able to play a
demo of this until the games release in Dec '97/Jan '98.<P>

Anyway, until the next issue....<P>
