<B><FONT SIZE="6">A</FONT>lthough there has been a lack of games news recently
there are still a large number of rumours circulating, here are a few of the
more interesting ones I have heard:-</B><P>

First off, EF2000 has come up again.  I reported quite a while ago that there
was 'supposedly' a version of this being made for the PPC.  Well, weather or not
this is the same rumour circulating or maybe more news on it has been released
I'm not sure.  I guess it's just one of them things when we'll have to wait and
see...<P>

<B>I have also heard that there is Tomb Raider type game in development for the
Amiga.  It is nothing to do with Eidos what so ever but completly independent.
The game will apparantly be 040+ only and features some spectacular
graphics.</B><P>

One thing that may please you adventure fans out there is that Monkey Island 3
is coming to the Amiga (Apparantly :).  It will be available for PPC Amiga only
and will be release by none other then LucasArts themselves.  You may think it
is kinda strage that LucasArts are coming back to the Amiga with such a big
title, I do too.  However, as long as there is a chance that it is true, it is
excellent news.<P>

<B>What else is there?  Well, I have heard information about a PPC only Quake
clone that is being coded. Also there have been a lot of rumours flying about
regarding Clickbooms next game, some have been told it is a new game, others
that it is a port. I personally have a pretty good idea what it is but, for now,
I will be keeping this too myself....:)</B><P>
