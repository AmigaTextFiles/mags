<FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>'m sure many of you already know this but below is a
press release from Vulcan regarding a big move in there distribution
network:-<P>
<UL>
<B>
Vulcan Software Limited is proud to announce huge changes to it's
operations. An exciting new alliance has been formed, from October 1997
Weird Science Ltd and their international trading partners GTI GmbH will
begin exclusive distribution of all Vulcan products.
<P>
Vulcan has been distributing it's own products for the past four years
to dealers around the world and to the public through it's international
mail order service, but all this is about to change. GTI will be taking
over Vulcan's European trade accounts whilst all Vulcan's existing
registered users will be transferred into the capable hands of Weird
Science who will provide them with regular mailings about Vulcan
releases along with excellent mail order service. 
<P>
We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our registered
users for their support and encouragement over the years and offer our
reassurance that they are not losing a Vulcan but gaining a Weird
Science and it's for the benefit of all concerned including the Amigas
future.
<P>
These changes have been undertaken as a direct result of the enormous
expansion of Vulcan's development and publishing operations. Vulcan has
set it's sights on higher spec titles in it's drive to bring Amiga
gaming in line with other platforms. In June 1997 we announced that all
future titles would be Amiga CD Rom only in direct response to the
quality of software that is currently in development and began actively
supporting graphics cards and sound cards in releases such as Genetic
Species, Hard Target and Almagica. Future developments include PPC
support, details of which will be announced shortly.
<P>
"We felt that in order to realise our current goals, we would have to
re-evaluate our existing operations." says Lisa, director of Vulcan
Software. "It is all very well producing the cream of Amiga
Entertainment software but it is equally important that the distribution
network can do justice to the efforts of our army of developers which
now includes 14 dedicated teams and over 100 graphic artists, musicians,
programmers, 3D animators and translators. With Weird Science and GTI
handling our distribution needs we can dedicate our time and resources
to our development and publishing operations."
<P>
All these advancements can only build on the excellent record we have
achieved so far, our list of imminent releases is a testament to this
and includes the likes of Strangers, The Final Odyssey, Uropa2, Genetic
Species, Hell Pigs, Wasted Dreams, Hard Target and Almagica, Scions of a
Forgotten World. 
<P>
Weird Science and GTI are professional, imaginative companies with a
real commitment to the Amiga Market, together we can ensure that all our
releases are given the exposure they deserve and are accessible to Amiga
users everywhere.
<P>
Live Long & Prosper!
<P>
Kind Regards
