Hi David.<P>

Good work on the site/diskmag.  It helps raise the morale a little to know that
there are a lot of promising games in development.<P>

The last game I bought was Worms TDC and sadly I haven't seen a game since,
that is worth me parting with my cash.  This is depressing, but some of the up
and coming games you have covered (especially Foundation) seem exciting and
hopefully if the arrival of PowerPC is successful we will one day have games
equal to those seen often on the PC.<P>

Well, funnily enough the last game I brought was Worms - TDC, and like you
haven't really seen a game worth buying since then.  There have been a few of
the games that I was looking forward to that have been released but hey have
been big disapointments.<P>

I can only see Power-PC being the future of Amiga games at the moment, if it is
the right way to go though, is another matter.<P>

Hello!<P>

I've just finished reading your great "Amiga Nutta" magazine.  I felt I had
to write as when I downloaded
Issue 3 you said you had no mail yet :-(  I'm actually writing this from my
PC, my Amiga is a bit outdated
for any of the latest games, it's an A500 with a 20MB Hard Disk and 3MB RAM
:-)  I also have a Pentium 120
which I do most of my internet and that on (my Amiga doesn't have a modem).<P>

Anyway, I'd just like to say your magazine is really cool, keep it up, I
would like to keep getting information
on Amiga's.. they don't sell Amiga magazines in the shops here in Gisborne,
New Zealand anymore, as, well,
no one buys them.  Everyone has sold their Amiga (except me) because of
lack of support for software.  The
software on the coverdisks of magazines required A1200's and Wb3.0.. noone
had that.  My Amiga runs WB1.3!<P>

Also, you listed a cheat for Railroad Tycoon from Microprose, have you
tested this cheat, as it is the same cheat
as in A-Train!!! Did you get the games mixed up or is it the same cheat
(CHEATERCHEATERWIMP) for both games?<P>

Keep up the magazine.  Am waiting to download Issue 4 :-) :-)<P>

<B>The Amiga needs as many people to stay with it as possible.  I certainly
suggest that you try to upgrade your Amiga to a newer model, otherwise you won't
be able to play the excellent range of games that are lined up. :). I understand
that in countries like New Zealand it can be very hard to get hold of Amiga
hardware/software as the userbase has been dwindling for a long time. However,
with PPC just around the corner, it shouldn't get smaller anymore and with the
help of Gateway it will hopefully get bigger.<P>

As for the tip, no I haven't tested it, as I remember I nicked it from some
magazine, so blame them ;)).<P>

Hi David,<P>

I think your magazine is a very good idea (as good is your web site).
I`ve read the third issue and it miss only one thing.  What about serious
programs? Well it`s more and more job but that would be great! And what about
tutorials? Waiting your reply in the fourth issue. Best regards and Keep
goin`on.<P>

I have thought about expanding the magazine to other areas, however, I sometimes
find it hard to keep it going as it is without adding to it.  Maybe in the
future I'll will expand it into these areas but for now, unforunalty it is
going to stay concentrated on games.  That is, unless anyone would like to
help and make the magazine a joint effort. ;)<P></B>
