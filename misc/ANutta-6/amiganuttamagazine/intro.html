As some of you may know, the Amiga Nutta magazine has been available on the WWW
for the last year or so.  It has built quite a following but was limited to
people that had web access.<P>

Hopefully with the introduction of this distribrutable version more people will
be able to benefit from the latest games news which Amiga Nutta brings.<P>

The magazine will be bi-weekly and will be availble from a number of locations. 
aAt the moment this is just Aminet and a BBS in the UK, hopefully this will grow
as people discover the magazine.  The news in the magazine will consist of the
previous two week worth of news that has been on the website, which is updated
daily.<P>

Anyway, have a look around.  Not everything is complete yet with the charts and
the release schedule needing a little work.<P>

Look out for the next issue in a couple of weeks time.
