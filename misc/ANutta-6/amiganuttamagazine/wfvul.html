<FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>'m pleased to announce that World Foundry will be signing
up to Vulcan.  As yet final documents have not been signed but it is looking
almost certain that things will go through without any problems.  I was going
to wait till everything was official but since the news has already been
released on other news pages I didn't see any point in it.<P>

The deal covers all of World Foundrys current and future games.  At the moment
this covers PPC and 68k versions of both Explorer 2260 and Maim & Mangle.<P>

Explorer 2260 as I'm sure all of you know is 3D space simulation somewhat along
the lines of Frontier.  However, don't think that this is just a copy of
Frontier, because it is not, it is far more then this and is set to become one
of, if not the best space simulation ever.  More information about this game
can be found at the <A HREF="http://www.explorer2260.home.ml org">Collins
Encyclopedia Galactia</a>.<P>

There other game Main & Mangle is a realtime strategy game that takes all
the best bits from DuneII & Command & Conquer and then builds on them.<P>

More information about both these games can be found at
the <A HREF="http://www.worldfoundry.home.ml.org">World Foundry Webpage.</a><P>
