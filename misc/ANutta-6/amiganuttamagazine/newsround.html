<B><FONT SIZE="6">W</FONT>ith the pages being left on the sideburner for the
last few weeks, the time for a news round-up has never been better. Heres the
stuff that I have missed and also a bit of new information.</B><P>

First off Trapped 2, as if none of you know, has been released.  This excellent
looking 3D game has gone down quite well and was awarded 92% by the UK magazine
CU Amiga.  I will have a review for you as soon.<P>

<B>For those of you interested in the Diversia Demo, and are awaiting it's
release.  Well it would seem your going to have to wait a little longer, the
demo has been released, but to publishers only.  There will not be a public
version released until just before the actual games release in December
'97/January '98.</B><P>

Another Command & Conquer clone, Forgotten forever is also eagerly awaited. 
Many have been asking what us going on with this game, well heres the story so
far.  The pathfinder has now been finished (One of the difficult parts of the
game).  The programmers are now working on re-coding the game to C instead of
Assembler, mainly so it is easier to port.  The author will not commit himself
to a release date for the demo or that game, so I guess you'll just have to
wait....<P>

<B>A few Vulcan games should be coming our way soon.  Uropa 2, Wasted Dreams &
Final Odyssey are all very nearly ready for release, hopefully all three will be
released very soon, Uropa2 and Final Odyssey are set for a November 1st
release.</B><P>
