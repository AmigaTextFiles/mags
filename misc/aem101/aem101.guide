@NODE edit "Editorial Page"
As I write this editorial, this newsletter has no name.  We used to be
known as CD남View, THE information and review source for the Amiga CD남
game machine.  For four months, we managed to review a lot of games and
generate a lot of interest.  With Commodore liquidating and the future of
the CD남 in doubt, we decided to shift this newsletter's focus towards the
Amiga.  In the last issue of CD남View, I asked the readers to name this new
version of the newsletter.  It's still quite early in the month and I have
only received one idea so far.  Hopefully, a good one will come along soon!

With the change in the newsletter, I've also regained a lot of enthusiasm.
I've already completed three reviews in the last week.  I want this
newsletter to kick some serious butt and I want to review as many games as
possible each month.  I still want reader contributions!  This will make 
the newsletter something for the readers to look forward to.  In CD남View,
we reviewed 4-5 games every month.  I'd like this newsletter to review at
least 10 games a month.  I don't know if I'll make it this month, because
I'll probably be writing them all myself, but I want to hit that goal next
month for sure!

If you want to submit a review for inclusion in the newsletter, just send
it to one of the e-mail addresses found in multiple places throughout the
newsletter.  There are no writing guidelines that have to be followed. 
Just make sure you give us the name of the game, the manufacturer's name
and address, the amount of memory and any other system requirements for
the game.  Make a note of the video mode the game needs (NTSC or PAL) and 
whether or not it's hard-drive installable or not.  Make sure you rate the
game in the four categories we use (Graphics, Sound, Gameplay and Control) 
and then average those for the overall rating.  That's it!  You can review
the game anyway you want to as long as that information is included.  

I think the newsletter will benefit a lot due to the inclusion of Amiga
games and related information.  I hope you enjoy this new format.  Please
ask your local Amiga BBS to carry the newsletter or to contact me about
being a distribution site.

For the CD남 users and owners out there, please don't think we're
abandoning you.  We will still review the newest CD남 games as soon as we
get them.  

We will stay committed to the CD남 and the Amiga.  We ask you to do the
same in these difficult times.  The Amiga is a computer that was
definitely ahead of its time.  Although its future is up in the air, it
still remains one of the most powerful home computers of all time.

@NODE THANKS "Thanks and Kudos!"
This month I'd like to thank all of the distribution sites for remaining
with the newsletter.  I really appreciate the support.

Thanks to all those that read and supported CD남View.  I really
appreciated the suggestions I recieved.

I'd also like to thank the few people that did send in their votes for
naming the newsletter.  Unfortunately, none of them really were what I was
looking for.  I think the new name gives the reader an idea of what one
will find within this newsletter, don't you?

@ENDNODE

@NODE ERRORS "Whoops!  We goofed."

Well...
-------
I would like to apologize to those people who wanted to be distribution
sites for CD남View that really never received a reply from me one way or
the other.  I didn't really get organized as far as collecting all my mail
from the various addresses until recently.  Hopefully, with Internet
access via Delphi, I can stay in better contact with all of those
interested in being distribution sites for the new newsletter.  I may be
able to UUENCODE the newsletter to get it to you via the Internet which
would greatly expand circulation.

If you check the list of distribution sites for this issue, you will
notice that only sites in the USA are listed.  I would like to have
distribution sites outside the United States.  If you are interested,
please E-mail me at this address: CASZATT@DELPHI.COM  

Thank you!

Also...

The report on joysticks scheduled for this issue has been pushed back an
issue due to the non-availablity of some of the sticks we wanted to look
at.  Hopefully, these sticks will come off of back-order status in time
for next month's issue.

This newsletter is created on Amiga computers.

It is worked on in various stages using an Amiga 2500 or an Amiga 3000T.
It all depends on where I am sitting at the time I'm typing...and I'm
always carrying a disk in my jacket with the most current version.

Software used: 

MEmacs, the editor supplied with every Amiga.  It's SIMPLY the best.  I've
tried others, but only MEmacs works for me.  Hey, at least I don't use ED!

Guide2Doc, by Bernd Koesling, is used to produce the ASCII/ANSI version
of the newsletter.  Thanks Koessi! 

BadLinks, by Roger Nedel, is used to test the links in the Amigaguide
version of the newsletter.  Thanks, Roger!

@NODE GAME1 "The Blue & The Gray Review"
THE BLUE AND THE GRAY
SYSTEM: Amiga 500 or higher
HARD DRIVE INSTALLABLE: Yes
MEMORY REQUIRED: 1 MB or higher
CONTROLLER: Mouse only
Workbench 1.3/2.x/3.x compatible

Simulations were not my thing.  I'll admit that now.  I thought I'd take a
look into one to see what they had to offer.  Feeling slightly bored with
the standard videogames, my brain was begging for something more substantial.

I might have gotten in over my head with THE BLUE & THE GRAY.  The game
comes with four books.  One is a technical supplement and tutorial.  (The
technical part applies mainly to the PC version of the game.  The Amiga
version is supplied with a "technical information" insert to compensate.) 
The second book is a campaign manual that points out all the workings of
moving your armies and the various options available to them.  The third
book is a "Micro Miniatures" Battle Manual that explains the battle mode
used by the game, which allows the gamer to control individual or groups
of soldiers.  The fourth book is a history book containing all sorts of
information about the Civil War.

This was all quite intimidating, but interesting.  Needless to say, I
wasn't very good at this game the first few times I played it.  I did,
however, manage to rewrite history by allowing the Confederate Army to
capture New York City.  My meager forces were no match for the South and
fell quickly.

The game is played by moving your troops around the map of the U.S. as it
was in the 1860's.  You can recruit new soldiers and equip them.  You're
allotted so many moves before the opposition takes it's turn.  This is
probably not new to regular players of simulation games, but it was new to
me.  

All in all, I feel I can recommend this game to hardcore simulation
players due to the complexity of the game and its many different options. 
I also believe I can recommend it to novice players because of the nifty
tutorial that's included.

The graphics are sparse as most simulation graphics are, and the sound is
minimal but effective.  It's the gameplay that keeps the game interesting.
It's not a perfect game, but it is certainly not mindless.

For a change of pace from those run-and-jump, hack-and-slash games. give
THE BLUE & THE GRAY a try.  Set aside an afternoon to get a grip on the
mechanics of the game and get into it.  It's not a game you can just plop
down in front of and expect to get anything out of it!

@NODE GAME2 "Ultimate Body Blows Review"
ULTIMATE BODY BLOWS
SYSTEM: CD남

BODY BLOWS was _the_ beat-em-up on the Amiga.  It annihilated the lame
Amiga version of STREET FIGHTER II and grabbed the fighting game crown. 
It went unchallenged until the Amiga version of MORTAL KOMBAT appeared.

Team 17 tried to recapture the crown with BODY BLOWS GALACTIC, a
disappointing update/sequel that featured an AGA version but hopelessly
goofy characters with ridiculous powers and hard to control moves.

Now, Team 17 attempts to capture the CD남 fighting game crown with
ULTIMATE BODY BLOWS, a combination of the two original games' characters
and backgrounds.  A whopping 22 characters are available for the player to
choose from.  All the characters from the original BODY BLOWS are back,
along with the entire goofy cast from BODY BLOWS GALACTIC.

Since the only other beat-em-up games available for the CD남 are
INTERNATIONAL KARATE + and DANGEROUS STREETS, both of which are horrible,
ULTIMATE BODY BLOWS wins hands down in terms of being the one to get.

The game improves on the first two in two main ways.  The first is that it
is PAL/NTSC switchable through a menu option.  The second is that the
horrible disk swapping that was really a pain on the first two games
is gone.

I do have some gripes though.  The GALACTIC characters are still too hard
to control and the computer is still too hard to beat even on the easiest
difficulty setting.  No manual comes with the game, so there are no
diagrams of even the most basic moves.  Most of the basic moves are the
same with each character, but it would be convenient to know what they
were to start with.

Overall, though, Team 17 has produced a winner.  It squashes the other
beat-em-ups into the ground and gives the CD남 a game that is easily just
as good as those available on the other console systems.  However, if the
CD남 version of MORTAL KOMBAT appears, ULTIMATE BODY BLOWS may fade from
memory.

@NODE GAME3 "Nick Faldo Championship Golf Review"
NICK FALDO'S CHAMPIONSHIP GOLF
SYSTEM: CD남

I don't golf in the real world, but I do enjoy a good golf videogame. 
Past favorites of mine include LEADER BOARD on the Commodore 64 and the
Amiga version of LINKS.  (I have an A3000, so the slow drawing times
experienced with LINKS on the slower machines never bothered me.)

NICK FALDO combines elements of those two games into a playable, but yet
somewhat disappointing CD남 golf game.

The graphics are hand-drawn, not digitized like LINKS, and are updated
rather slowly.  (Although, you don't see them being updated as you did in
early versions of LINKS.)

I'm sure you all know the basics of golf, so I won't describe the object
of the game.  There are several options that allow you to get the shot you
want, type of club to use and such.  That's all well done.  

The only real gripe I have with the game is the annoying commentary
provided by the computer.  The voice grates on you after awhile.  (A
friend of mine, who DOES play golf in the real world, kept yelling "Shut
up!" at the game.)  

A nice touch allows the game to work on NTSC and PAL systems without
any fumbling around with boot-up options.  You simply can scroll the
screen to see what you're missing.  (This is used before taking a swing at
the ball.)

I was expecting a little more, so that's probably why I was disappointed
with this game.  There's really nothing wrong with it...as golf games go.
With improved graphics and speed, it'd be a winner.

@NODE GAME4 "Surf Ninjas Review"
SURF NINJAS
SYSTEM: CD남

Games based on movies are notorious for usually being a way to disguise a
poor game by using a highly desireable character or situation from a
movie.  Ever since E.T. appeared on the screen of Atari 2600 game systems,
the track record of movie licensed games has been poor.  (Notable
exceptions being Ocean's ROBOCOP 3D and LucasArts' INDIANA JONES AND THE
FATE OF ATLANTIS, which isn't based on a movie per se, but a movie
character.)

SURF NINJAS, a movie I didn't see, did not strike me as a game waiting to
be made.  Since I didn't see the movie, I can't tell you how faithful the
game is to the spirit of the movie.  However, I can tell you that if it IS
faithful to the movie, I advise you to avoid the movie without hesitation.

SURF NINJAS, the game that is, requires you to fight off ninja warriors
while trying to collect various objects to complete each stage.  The
screen scrolls from right to left as you try to do this.  I say "try"
because this would be a fairly simple task if the game hadn't been
programmed in what seems to be BASIC.  As soon as more than two characters
appear on the screen at the same time, the game goes into what appears to
be slow-motion.  (A jump and kick move will take approximately 2-3 SECONDS
to execute completely from start to finish when three or more characters
are on the screen.  This is opposed to less than a second with one or two
characters are on the screen.)

Collision detection between characters is dreadfully slow and inaccurate. 
You can only kick someone while jumping up, not on your way down. 
Sometimes your character will act as if he has one of the ninjas in a
headlock...but he doesn't.  It hard enough to control a game in slow
motion, but when you can't even be sure that you're hitting someone when
you clearly should be is enough to make you feel like screaming.

Enough about the control of the game.  The graphics and music are also in
the same quality vein: Crap.  The music would sound appropriate on a
Commodore 64 game.  The graphics reminded me of the 8-bit Nintendo game
N.A.R.C.

I found it interesting that there was no warranty card in the box nor any
address on the packaging.  Whoever is responsible for this mess doesn't
seem to want to answer for it.  Flair's name appears when the game boots
up, but their name appears nowhere on the packaging.  MicroValue is the
company named on the packaging.  Neither lists an address on the box.

Whoever's responsible can step forward to accept this month's (and the
first ever) @{"LAME GAME OF THE MONTH" link LGTM} award.

@NODE GAME5 "Beneath the Steel Sky Review by Marc Buhmann"
BENEATH THE STEEL SKY
SYSTEM: Amiga 500 or higher
HARD DRIVE INSTALLABLE: Yes
MEMORY REQUIRED: 1 MB (1.5 MB for HD installed game)
CONTROLLER: Mouse only
Workbench 1.3/2.x/3.x compatible

   Beneath a Steel Sky was one of those games that just sits on the shelf,
drawing you towards it. I remember when I first walked into that store in
Edinburgh that had an entire wall covered with Amiga products. Boy was I in
heaven. I saw many games sitting on the shelf I wanted to buy, but only
Beneath a Steel Sky drew me towards it. I picked it off the shelf and
flipped to the back side. The pictures I saw looked fabulous! The
description of the game made me want to buy it even more! Before I knew what
I was doing, I was walking out of the store with a brand new (bought) game.
I felt pitty for myself because I had to wait another week and a half before
I could play it.

   When I finally got home and all the "fun" stuff about vacations was done
(unpacking), I sat down at my computer. I opened the box and looked at those
fifteen glorious disks just waiting to be installed on my hard drive. The 
first disk installed fine, but when I got to the second disk I began to
worry. It had been installing the second disk for over eight minutes. I was
tempted to boot the computer and start over, but decided to let it go.
Another four minutes passed (twelve minutes all together) and it finally
asked for the third disk. I sighed with relief and continued installing.

   After an hour and a half of work, the game was finally installed. I went
and used Degrader(tm) to flip to PAL (remember I bought the PAL version).
Then I went and started the game.

   I was amazed at how fast the loading time is. The first thing to the game
is an intro animation which lasts about thirty seconds. It loaded the first
part of the intro in less than ten seconds, and then the second part in
under five. And the animation is SMOOTH! Not like the crap you used to see
from Sierra(R).

   When I finally started the game, the graphics just pull you in. It's
amazing what a 32 colored computer can do. And Sierra(R) says that the Amiga
can't handle anything? I say bull*#%! to them. Anyways, the graphics are
done with reds, blacks, and shades in between. It gives you a dark look to
the game which I really enjoy.

   After many days of grueling play, I finally got stuck. Actually I'm still
stuck, so if anyone has a walk through, cheat sheet, or other form of
"hint", please contact me. My address is will be at the end of this
documentation. Well anyways. The game is difficult, and with a droid who
talks back (Joey... your helpful, medal-brained, side-kick) it adds a touch
of British humor. Some of the puzzles are complicated and are hard to figure
out, others are just common sense.

   The music is your average computer music, but it does have a nice quality
that doesn't disappoint you. The sound effects are good and are in synch
with the actions. No complaints here.

   I've also heard rumors that this is a sequel to Lure of the Temptress. I
haven't been able to get hard core proof of this, but I'm in the process of
trying to find a copy of the game. I'll get the answer out on the nets
sometime later this month.

   By far, this is one of the best 3-D adventure games I've played. The only
other game that is as good that I've seen is Legend of Kyrandia(tm). If you
liked that game, I really think you should check out this game. It is worth
a look at.

LIKES AND DISLIKES

   First the dislikes. I really didn't like waiting twelve minutes for one
disk to load. The only other thing I dislike about the game is that you have
to go through the entire intro animation before you can restore a game. I
feel that they could have made it possible to reload right from the start.
Sorry to say, but Sierra(R) has 'em beat here.

   Now the likes. I liked everything about the game! The graphics, sound,
music, animation, etc... all perfect! Some even beyond perfect! I hope
Revolution Software and Virgin Entertainment are happy with their finished
product. It's kick ass.

@NODE GAME6 "Quick Capsule Reviews"
This is a quick glance at some games I had a chance to play for a bit, but
didn't get a chance to do a complete review of:

BATTLETOADS - (Amiga)
Ugh!  This was announced about two years ago.  It's finally hit the
shelves.  I think it should have stayed where ever it came from.  The
graphics are 8-bit quality and yet still don't fill the whole screen.  The
control is horrible.  Just a complete mess.

OVERALL RATING: 25%


ELFMANIA - (Amiga)
This game WILL get a complete review next issue.  It's a beat-em-up with a
bit of arcade challenge thrown in for good measure.  The graphics are
good...even when they move, unlike DANGEROUS STREETS.  The control was a
little on the sloppy side, but it could have been the joystick I had. 
(That's why I don't want to pass judgement in this review.)

Look for a full review next issue...it looks like a winner, though.

@NODE RATINGS "The Ratings - Explained"

We judge the games we review in four different categories:

Graphics
--------
This is pretty self explanatory.  The higher the percentile, the better
the graphics are.

Sound
-----
Another no-brainer.  The higher the percentile, the better the sound. 
Although, this also relates to it's coordination with the gameplay.  If 
the sound seems inappropriate for the type of game it is, the game will
score lower in the Sound category even if the sounds are technically well
done.

Gameplay
--------
The gameplay refers to the addictive quality of the game as well as the
way the game plays.  If you find your self sitting and watching rather
than interacting with the game, the game will score lower than one that
actually involves you.

Control
-------
This refers to how easy the game is to control given the standard CD남 
controller.  A game requiring a special controller that is not specified
or not included will be penalized.  A game that comes with a special 
controller or one that recommends that, say, an Amiga mouse might work
better than the standard CD남 controller will not be penalized.

@ENDNODE

@NODE LGTM "Lame Game of the Month"
This is an award presented to one game per month for being the worst of
that month's issue.  It's mainly to warn you, the consumer, about a game
that's REALLY bad.

If we have an issue with no really bad games...there'll be no award given.
A game that wins this award DESERVES to win!

This isn't a rumor, this is a fact!

AmigaWorld Magazine, with the help of its publisher, has set up an
information hotline to distribute information about the Commodore
liquidation.  

Call 1-800-441-4403 and ask for extension 365 to hear the latest
information about the Bahamian Supreme Court hearings.  (If you're calling
after business hours, simply type in 365 on a touch tone phone when 
prompted.)

Many thanks to AmigaWorld and TechMedia for setting this line up.  It will
quell a lot of rumors!

This month we've got some actual facts about the SX-1!

	@{" The SX-1: Check the Specs " link SX1} - The facts!!!

@ENDNODE

@NODE SX1 "The SX-1's Specs by Chris O'Donnell"
The SX-1 Expansion for the CD32

  By the time CD32 was released my trusty Amiga 1200 already had a 030
accelerator and 4MB Fast RAM. I had always envisioned a time when the
CD32 adaptor would be released and I would be able to enjoy full motion
video on my 1200.  Now I know this will never happen. The specs on the
CD32 adaptor that CBM released before they "went under" revealed that
there would only be support for the AKIKO chip - no full motion video!
Assuming, of course, that it is ever released at all. Even worse - no
accelerator support! Yep - my 030 would have to be unplugged whenever I
wanted to use the CD32 adaptor.

  For the CD32, the news is a little more encouraging. Thanks to
Paravision, CD32 owners can now upgrade their machines into enhanced
Amiga 1200s.  You have problably heard a lot of rumors concerning this
device. Tired of rumors, I called Paravision and they gave me the details.
Heres what the SX-1 has for features:

       
               2.5" internal and 3.5" external IDE drives

                         1 72 PIN SIMM socket

                   Parallel,Serial,RGB,Keyboard ports

                           Audio input

                        Hardware disable switch

                 Will not interfere with the FMV module!


PROS:
   For starters by including both connectors for the 2.5" and 3.5" they
have given us the best of both worlds. If desk space is your main concern
the 2.5" drive will fit inside the SX-1 case. On the other hand if price
is your main concern the 3.5" drives are much cheaper but you will need
an external case which will take up more desk area.

   The SIMM socket is a very important feature of the SX-1. Some games
such as Wing Commander CD32 should see a noticable speed increase with the
addition of Fast RAM. Remeber the CD32 has 2MB of ram but just like the 
1200 this is Chip ram which runs on a 16 bit data path. This cripples the
system to a crawl.  In fact when I added my 50MHZ accelerator to my 1200,
I saw NO noticable speed increase until I added Fast RAM!  Since only one
socket is available to add ram you must choose the amount you are going to
add wisely. I would reccommend 4 MB.  This will give you ample RAM for most
applications. The SX-1 will use up to 8 MB but anything above the 4 meg mark
will not be used if you have the Full motion Video module plugged in. 

   With the RGB connector you can add any monitor the 1200 can use. The
Serial and parallel ports will allow you to use a number of different
add-ons such as Printers and modems, And the floppy drive port uses standard
Amiga floppy drives. The keyboard port accepts a standard AT type 101 key
keyboard. The Required decoder chip is built into the SX-1 and according to
Paravision, all AT keyboards they have tested with it work. IMHO This was
a smart move. With Commodores current crisis it may be hard to locate the
Amiga type keyboards while the AT keyboards are cheap and plentiful. A 
hardware switch allows you to turn the SX1 off in case of compatibility 
problems with any CD32 disks. The audio input is intended for karaoke 
and presentation type applications my first reaction was to assume it is 
an 8 bit audio digitizer. It isn't. I am still unsure as to the immediate
applications open to this port.

CONS:
   The SX-1 will not provide accelerator support nor will it allow the 
addition of any SCSI devices.

   The end result? The SX-1 is an outstanding value for the CD32 owner.
It allows you to transform your game machine into an expandable productivity
machine.  For those looking for the hard to find 1200 here is a viable 
alternative. Paravision has demonstrated it's commitment to the Amiga
platform and released the real power in the CD32!

PRICE: Basic SX-1 - $277.00

       SX-1 with 40 MB HD - $451.00

       SX-1 with 4 MB RAM - $445.00

       SX-1 with 40 MB HD/4 MB RAM - $619.00


       NOTE: All prices are MSRP - actual prices may be lower

             Scheduled Release date is June 27, 1994

             The specs released in the Summer '94 AC's Guide were

             incorrect! According to Paravision The keyboard decoder 
             
             chip and the Ram activation Kit are all included with the SX1!


Thanks goes to Paravision! I have only great things to say about their
Product support. When I called with questions regarding my M1230XA
accelerator they were patient and helpful. And when my setup disk
crashed - they sent me two replacements. (saving me from myself) ;)

This month's contribution from David W. Martin, who can be reached via
the Internet at MARTIN_D_W/ICPO_00%LESC.LOCKHEED.COM@vm.ucs.UAlberta.CA

IF OPERATING SYSTEMS WERE AIRLINES

Amiga Airline: The airport terminal is nice and colorful, with
  friendly stewards and stewardesses, easy access to the plane, an
  uneventful takeoff. For the more adventurous: travelers can travel
  on multiple planes and visit multiple destinations all at the same
  time. During these multiple plane trips the user can even take
  a side trip on Mac, DOS, Unix, or Windows airlines.

DOS Airline: Everybody pushes the airplane until it glides, then
  jump on and let the plane coast until it hits the ground again,
  then push again, jump on again and so on.

DOS with QEMM Airline: The same thing but with more leg room to
  push.

Mac Airline: All the stewards, stewardesses, captains, baggage
  handlers, and ticket agents look the same, act the same, and talk
  the same. Every time you ask questions about details, you are
  told you don't need to know, don't want to know, and everything
  will be done for you without you having to know, so just shut up.

MPE Airline: It's a little difficult to get a ticket because
  you have to sign up for the right plane, specify you want a
  seat to sit in, identify each piece of baggage and list it on
  your ticket, and once you enter the plane you may never see the
  same steward/ess twice. However, once the plane takes off, the
  ride is exceptionally smooth and usually on-time, unless you
  cross a timezone (this results in your being placed in a holding
  pattern for 1 hour until the plane's clock and the local clocks
  are synchronized). Should the unthinkable happen and your flight
  ends in a crash, you will be magically whisked back to the origin
  of the flight where you will be placed on the next plane out.

OS/2 Airline: To board the plane, you have your ticket stamped
  ten different times by standing in ten different lines. Then you
  fill out a form showing where you want to sit and whether it
  should look and feel like an ocean liner, a passenger train, or a
  bus. If you succeed in getting on board the plane and the plane
  succeeds in getting off the ground, you have a wonderful
  trip...except for the times when the rudder and flaps get frozen
  in position, in which case you have time to say your prayers and
  get yourself prepared before the crash.

Windows Airline: The airport terminal is nice and colorful, with
  friendly stewards and stewardesses, easy access to the plane, an
  uneventful takeoff...then the plane blows up without any warning
  whatsoever.

NT Airline: Everyone marches out on the runway, says the
  password in unison, and forms the outline of an airplane. Then
  they all sit down and make a whooshing sound like they're fly-
  ing.

Unix Airline: Everyone brings one piece of the plane with them
  when they come to the airport. They all go out on the runway
  and put the plane together piece by piece, arguing constantly
  about what kind of plane they're building.
