                              Film at Eleven
                               by @{"Jim Meyer" link jimm}


Apple has a used piece of fruit as a corporate logo.  IBM has its
initials, subdivided by horizontal lines.  And Commodore has the
"chickenhead."  But what of the Amigan?  Is there no appropriate logo for
this intrepid computerist?  Judging by the response to last month's Film
at Eleven, I'm sorely tempted to propose the ostrich.

But that would be terribly unfair.  Yes, there is a small (but vocal)
group of Amiga fanatics who would have the world believe that Commodore
is about to unveil a machine that will rival a Cray 2, that a harried
crew of 5 full-time and 1 part-time programmers will somehow not only
maintain the current Amiga software but also find the time to port it to
a new RISC chip, all while simultaneously creating the Ultimate Games
Machine, and anyone who says otherwise is a heretic or traitor.  But the
vast majority of Amiga owners are sane, sensible folks.  And there are
some heroes.

Take Marc Rifkin and Mike Levin.  You may know them as the people who
have organized and spearheaded the Commodore Stockholder's Movement.
While there have been well-intentioned (and somewhat naive) attempts in
the past to exert some influence on Commodore through the stockholders,
Marc and Mike have been more persistent, have put more research and
thought into the project, and have actually met with a measure of
success.  (See our report on the Annual Meeting, later in this issue.)

Take Andy Finkel.  He's been a familiar online presence for as long as
there has been an Amiga.  He was one of the few West Chester folks to be
adopted by the original Amiga gang in Los Gatos as one of their own.  And
as long as there have been Amiga questions, Andy has been right there,
pulling amazingly detailed explanations of murky AmigaDOS esoterica out
of thin air.

What about those companies who have stuck with the Amiga for the long
haul?  Soft Logik, whose PageStream product has evolved from a rather
quirky start, continues to strive toward the creation of the best desktop
publishing system, not just on the Amiga, but anywhere.

How about names from the past, people like Miner and Mical, Luck and
Sassenrath, folks who demonstrated to everyone (but Apple, it seems) that
multitasking was not only nifty but necessary, and that fast, colorful
graphics really were better than green screens or 9-inch monochrome.  And
that multimedia was not only fun, but useful.

And let's not forget all those folks who woke up last week, and - despite
the release of the PowerMacs - discovered that their Amigas were still
working, were still fun to use.  And were paid for.

Some of those folks are right in our own backyard.  Dennis Schaeffer
works for NBC, and was just a little irked when NBC sponsored a Mac-only
contest for the short "peacock animation" that opens up the prime-time
segment.  So Dennis did something about it.  He dragged out Imagine, and
put together a 4-second spot that starts off with a semi- circle of
lightbulbs (read the inscription VERY carefully, if you can!) as a
ghostly hand heads for the wall switch.  One flick, and the familiar NBC
peacock comes into view.

Dennis must have done something right, because NBC not only aired that
spot, but they put it into the regular rotation.

And the *StarShip*'s own Eric Geisecke, also known as Sidewinder, just
finished pressing an audio CD - @{"Future Shock 2." link shock}  What's special about
that?  Well, it's 100% Amiga-produced, all 15 tracks, even down to the
cover graphics, by Zak Jarvis.  You can order this "Techno/Rave/Ambient-
Tribal/Syntho Pop/Jazz" CD (autographed, even!) directly from Eric.

Meanwhile, the folks with their heads in the sand have been busy shooting
the messenger, and perpetuating numbers (like 450,000 CD32s sold) that
are pure fantasy.  But none of this helps the Amiga's cause.  It only
serves to build up hopes that are sure to be dashed.

All of this comes at a time when the news from Commodore is decidedly
mixed, and the future is still precarious.  A recent announcement
heralded the return to production of the A1200 and the 1084 and 1942
monitors.  The fine print of the announcement indicated that production
was being bankrolled by one of Commodore's distributors, Microsphere,
Inc.  While Commodore's cash position isn't heartening, anything that
gets the A1200 into production is good news.

In other news, word comes that the A4000T will finally be released. Alas,
this "release" will consist of around 35 machines, all hand built.  A
fair number are said to be headed for Newtek as testbeds for an ongoing
project.  Any real production run will have to await funding, although
it's always possible that NewTek will bankroll it.

CD32 news has been better this last month, with mentions of it in the
press becoming more numerous and more favorable.  With the recent release
of CD32 into the U.S. market, the possibility remains that Commodore will
be able to generate some momentum.  But even an avalanche of sales - a
million or so - will do little to help the Amiga's outlook until and
unless Commodore revamps its global corporate structure and gets new
leadership.  (Late note: Commodore's dismal performance in the last 3
months of 1993 are reflected in the recently released quarterly report,
which shows the lowest sales - $70 million - in memory for that quarter.)

As the list of former Amiga engineers grows larger (there are currently
more Commodore executives than software engineers), one thing is clear:
we cannot look to Commodore for solutions.  As they sort out their
priorities and corporate structure,  the fate of the Amiga rests largely
in our hands.  So remember the few, the proud, the Amiga Heroes.  And
give them your support.

                     Letters... We Get Letters....

Here's a sampling of the mail we found waiting after last month's
ViewPort.  Much of it comes from a thread on Internet, in
comp.sys.amiga.advocacy, entitled "LIES IN FEB94 VIEWPORT ONLINE MAG."
The text has been edited for space, spelling, and grammar, but is
otherwise intact. Portions following deleted material are preceded by
ellipses (...).

Dear Editor:  Hmmm, where exactly did you get your info from? Apple Corp.?

I found your article very sinister and unfair. The people who trust you
as an "insider" may actually believe you. Especially those people who
don't have ready access to other sources of reliable information.  Hope
your conciousness (sic) is clear...then again you may actually feel proud
of yourself.  - Victor Major

Dear Mr. Major:  I'm sorry you feel that way.  No, it's never a pleasure
to deliver bad news about my favorite computer.  Yes, my conscience is
clear. - JMM

Dear Editor:  You have lost your mind, I'm sorry to say.  All of your
figures of Commodore's sales of the Amiga 1200 and CD32 are totally
inaccurate.  Commodore has not sold 55,000 CD32s... They have sold
400,000 CD32s.

And it is the #1 game machine in Europe, outselling Mega CD by Sega by
4:1.  Please get your facts right, or don't say anything at all.  Also,
upon contacting Digital Creations, they HAVE NOT stopped Amiga support,
and have no intentions of doing so.  There are many other falsities in
your editorial.  Face it:  You lied to the Amiga community.  And I for
one, will do everything I can to try to correct the misinformation that
you have touted as truth to the Amiga community. - Thomas R. Sawyer

Dear Mr. Sawyer: I never said that Digital Creations was dropping Amiga
support.  The phrase I used was "no new Amiga development."  It might
have better been phrased "no new Amiga titles."  Digital Creations has
confirmed that products that have already been announced, like Brilliance
2.0 and the Video Slot Box, will be released.  They will also be showing
the V-Machine, a Toaster-like product originally slated for the Amiga, at
NAB.  The V-Machine currently runs under Windows in a 486-powered
computer; draw your own conclusions.

As for the volume of CD32 sales, Commodore finally admitted that sales had
not been good, blaming it on the "poor environment for games machines" in
Europe.  One would have a hard time figuring how they managed to sell
400,000 CD32s and only pull in a total of $70 million for the quarter.  If
nothing else, we hope that you'll put a little more stock in what ViewPort
says than in the free-wheeling rumors that are found on the nets. - JMM

In two postings on Internet, Jim Norris writes:

The Feb issue of GEnie's ViewPort magazine has an editorial- 'Film at
Eleven' written by Jim Meyer (coauthor of the Brilliance manual) that
contains enough in the way of factual inaccuracy to call into queston the
integrity of its author.

... As far as AAA is concerned, I'm sure that the majority of you well
know that AAA is -already- in silicon and in its final stages of
completion. This information is common knowledge to those who read Usenet
or keep up on current Amiga-related events. Where Mr. Meyers (sic)
received this information is unknown, however, confirmation of AAA's
development and implementation come from C= itself.

 ... You seem to equate working for the Starship as some form of Amiga
advocacy. Did it ever occur to you that it is simply a job for many of
them? The Starship is one of GEnie's biggest roundtables; the folks who
moderate it do it for the money, not necessarily out of some deep love
for the Amiga.

... A lot of bad blood apparently exists between Mr. Meyer and many in
the Amiga community. He has had, by his own admission, bad dealings with
.info, AMnews, Portal and now apparently with Digital Creations to the
tune of several thousand $$$ owed him. This might be speculation, but do
you think it is possible that he might have an axe to grind?

Dear Mr. Norris: About AAA: It's dead.  Period.  Still.  It was cancelled
on January 17.  Furthermore, the version that did exist suffered from
fundamental design problems. There is a big difference between "exists in
silicon" and "works in silicon." While the AAA design embodies a number of
worthwhile concepts, the amount of money required for a single silicon pass
(two more would probably have been required) could be used for other
purposes.  Like doubling the number of Amiga software engineers.

As for your statement that the members of the *StarShip* staff do what
they do for money, rather than any love for the Amiga, I respectfully
submit that you are clueless.  While it goes against policy to discuss
compensation, my understanding is that most - if not all - commercial
online services merely waive connect charges for the assistants.  In the
case of GEnie, connect charges are $3.00 per hour.  Trust me; we do it
because we love the Amiga and care about the Amiga community.

Finally, your assertion that I have some axe to grind because of "bad
dealings with .info, AMnews, Portal and now apparently with Digital
Creations..." is pure bunk.  Digital Creations pays promptly and well,
and doesn't owe me a dime.  The last time I checked, I was still friends
with Mark Brown, my Editor (and a real class act) at .info.  As for
AMnews, it went under owing over $100,000 to various members of the Amiga
community and small business-people, most of whom could ill afford the
debt.  I'm not the only one who has less-than-fond memories of Mark
Jacobson, the publisher of AMnews.  Portal??  I've never been a member.

What disturbs me most of all is the ease with which you were able to make
your accusations.   One would hope that the participants in a forum that
has a potential audience of millions would exercise some responsibility.
Alas, one doesn't have to spend much time on Internet to see that this is
not so. - JMM

And finally, there were these two letters:

Dear Editor:  Where the h is my March ViewPort?????????  - Otis Ivie

Dear Otis:

You're reading it!  You're reading it! - JMM

Jim -  Once again, you wrote a great editorial.  Well conceived and
executed.  - Rhett Anderson

Dear Rhett:

Thanks.  I needed that! - JMM

AmigaGuide Tips: Personal Help System by @{"Robin Evans" link robin}

Tired of searching though a web of directories to find the guide document
that explains a program? Here's a solution:

Create an AmigaGuide control panel for all the help files that you've
collected. It's easy to do. Here's an example:

 \@database help.guide
 \@node MAIN " Personal help system"

 Help files:
   \@{" AmigaGuide     " link AmigaGuide.guide/MAIN}
   \@{" ARexx          " link ARexxGuide.guide/MAIN}
   \@{" RexxReqTools   " link rexxreqtools.guide/MAIN}
   \@{" Edge           " link edge.guide/MAIN}
   \@{" Magazines      " link MAGS}
 \@{" File directory   " rx "help.rexx"}
 \@endnode

\@node MAGS "Magazines"

   \@{" Viewport 3/93  " link .../MAIN}
   \@{" Viewport 1/93  " link .../MAIN}

 \@endnode

You should, of course, substitute the names of the files that you have
and use on your own system. The `file directory' entry would run a rexx
script called `help.rexx'. That file could be used to show other choices.

You can call your controller anything you wish, but calling it
`help.guide' has some unique advantages: Unless a special document is
defined in the guide, your new control panel will become the default help
file for other guides. You'll be able to see it again by pressing the
`Help' button on the viewer or by pressing the <Help> key when the viewer
is active.

If you use a different name, you can still get back to your control panel
by adding a new line to each of the files listed there. Add this right
after the line that starts '\@node MAIN':

   \@toc <name>.guide/MAIN

Substitute for <name> the actual name of your new file. That will make
the contents keys of the guides referenced in the help document call up
the control panel.

The files that are included in your control panel don't have to be stored
in the same directory. The directory where they're located need not be
included in the link command as long as it is included in the
environmental variable 'AmigaGuide/path'. Each of the directories listed
(and separated by a space) in that variable will be searched by
AmigaGuide when it encounters the name of a file that can't be found in
the current directory.

   "The court calls Loriann Babbit."

   The courtroom became still. Loriann strode to the witness stand. She
scanned the room. Her dark brown eyes flashed as her glance fell on the
man seated at the defense table. He shifted uncomfortably in his slightly
too-small suit and fingered some papers in front of him.

   "DoyousweartotellthetruthandnothingbutthetruthsohelpyouGod?" chanted
the bailiff.

   "I do."

   "Be seated."

   Loriann sat. She tossed her head back like a filly entering the
winner's circle. The attorney sauntered over.

   "Ms. Babbit, can you tell the court when the abuse began?"

   "Yes. It started the day my husband," Loriann put quotes around
'husband', "came home from Wal-Mart with that, that other machine."

   "The DOS one?"

   "Yes, that one. Nothing I did was right. I showed him ICONS (#22507,
NURICONS.LHA, 11392 bytes). It's a collection of unusual, multicolor
icons like Popeye (selects into Olive Oyl), a howling coyote, a wormy
apple, and cow. The artwork is excellent, and looks wonderful on 24 bit
boards. Then there's Busy Banana (#22445, BUSYBANANAPOINTERS.LHA, 10112
bytes), a group of animated busy pointers. The archive includes a peeling
banana and twirling dancer. I thought he would think them cute." "What
was your husband's reaction?"

   "He snorted. 'Not professional! he says. 'Professional is a gray
static hourglass. Professional is gray icons on a VGA screen.'"

   Loriann reached for the box of tissues. "I tried OPTICON (#22378
OPTICON.LHA, 53504 bytes)? It's a collection of utilities like Icon2C. It
reads in given '.info' file and writes out C code. This allows you to
modify any icon image to your own needs. OptIcon reads in given ".info"
files and scans the icon image in order to optimize the icon Image
structure and save space. It didn't help. John said rude things about my
computer."

   She pulled out more tissues. "I showed him FasterBlit
(#22384, FBL6.2.LHA, 7424 bytes), Arthur Hagen's program that
snaps up the Amiga's blitter (used for video display). Even
WordPerfect scrolls faster. While it multi-tasks! SuperDark
screen blankers zip along. Just watch where you put the program.
When I placed in my User-Startup sequence, the whole computer
slowed to a crawl. An iconX routine in WBStartup caused the
machine to be non-responsive to the mouse. So now I just type the
command in by CLI."

   The attorney leaned against the witness stand. "And your
husband was not impressed?"

   "No! So I demoed Fitter (#22502, FITTER_V1.01.LHA, 55296
bytes). Fitter is Joe Thomas' utility designed to make
transfering of files from a groaning full hard drive to floppy
disks easier. Fitter uses an algorithm to determine a way to put
these files on disks so that floppy diskspace is optimized. Most
features are accessed by mouse clicks."

   "And your husband?"

   "He looked at me as though I had gone senile. 'If you're
hard drive is full, buy a bigger hard drive! Floppies are old
fashioned!'"

   "I felt more and more degraded. I went on. How about Life and Death
Clock? (#22437, LIFEDEATHCLK.LHA, 80640 bytes). This is Mike Haas'
comparisons between causes of death versus civilian use of firearms for
self-defense. You may not agree with the politics, but the Clock is very
well designed and created."

   Loriann shot a glance at Mr. Babbit, then continued. "Games, how about
games? GEnie is fortunate to have some clever and creative members. Bob
Akerberg brings us Sydney (322490, SYDNEY.LZH, 255360 bytes), an AMOS
arcade game where you play Sydney, a snake fighting to free your part of
the desert from invaders. It's a little different, since initially, all
you can do is crawl forward, and burrow into the ground. But you can eat
scorpion eggs and get more powerful."

   Loriann leaned foward. "Then there's Scorched Earth (#22513,
SCORCH175.LHA, 498560 bytes), Michael Welch's near cousin to the IBM's
Scorched Tanks, a warfare game where up to 4 human players or computer
controlled opponents buy fancy weapons and try to blow each othe up.
'Taint as easy as it sounds. Scorched Earth features good graphics, a
slick interface, and a impressive intro. $10 bucks gets you a version
which saves games."

   "And still your husband was not satisfied?" asked the lawyer.

   "No, not John! He said the most vile, wicked thing he could." Loriann
stopped for a second. "He leaned close to me and...and...sneered 'you
don't have spreadsheets!' Then he leaned back and laughed. A horrible,
mocking laugh."

   "Then what happened?"

   Loriann dabbed her eyes. "Well, after my husband went to sleep, I went
into the kitchen..."

   "Yes?"

   "I picked up a new knife, then I...I," Loriann swallowed hard. "Cut
off my husband's p...p..."

   "I know this is tough for you, Loriann. Your husband was asleep, you
took a knife and ---"

   Loriann took a deep breath. She paused, like a diver perched at the
edge of the highest board at the pool. Then she jumped. "I took the knife
and cut off my husband's parallel cable!"

CSM Update: Commodore's Annual Meeting

March 2, 1994

Nassau, Bahamas - "We are not a rubber stamp board of directors," replied
Commodore Chairman Irving Gould to an accusation by computer dealer,
Jeffrey Moscow.

By this time during the 1993/94 Annual Shareholder Meeting of Commodore
International, board members had been repeatedly questioned on counts of
inept management - for having led this NYSE issue to a net loss of $356
million for FY93.  Only two years earlier, Commodore enjoyed annual net
sales in excess of one billion dollars. Shareholder equity is now about
(negative) -10.78 per share and Commodore owes over $50 million to banks
in 18 different countries. The banks are putting the pressure on
Commodore to repay, and Commodore is trying to avoid legal actions.

The meeting, which was four months overdue, was held this March 2nd in
its usual location, the exclusive Lyford Cay Club in Nassau, Bahamas
where Commodore holds its incorporation.

There was no repeat of the scene of November, 1991 when a dissenting
shareholder was physically ejected from the meeting, but passions were
nonetheless running high.  At one point, Moscow asked General Alexander
Haig - one of Commodore's five directors - to encourage Irving Gould to
step down in the same way he had admirably done so with a certain US
President.  Someone has to take control, insisted Moscow; nothing is
going to improve under current management, he went on.

For about a half-hour, Gould, Moscow and shareholders parried comments on
Commodore's ailing situation and prospects for recovery. Commodore is an
international company which manufacturers the Amiga - the most popular
model home computer in Europe and the host to many professional video
products in the United States - for instance, the Video Toaster which has
revolutionized the video industry.  Commodore also recently introduced
CD32, a 32-bit game machine which is becoming a hit in Europe.

At the annual meeting, shareholders contended that perpetual mistakes,
including inadequate supply of products during consecutive Christmas
seasons, was responsible for the losses, while Commodore blamed the
effects of soft economic conditions in Europe, their largest market.

But whatever the cause of Commodore's problems, everyone at the meeting
agreed that something needed to be done - perhaps new management or a
grass-roots marketing campaign tapping into the enthusiasm of the
Commodore base of customers as suggested by Michael Levin.  Levin
described himself as a spokesperson for these customers - many of whom
have and are still actively becoming shareholders.  The only thing being
asked of Commodore was leadership. The lack of confidence in management
was demonstrated by the shareholder defeat of a proposed amendment to
Commodore's articles of association.  This amendment would eliminate
shareholder checks concerning large decisions such as mergers and sales
of company assets.

Another point raised at the meeting was Commodore's urgent need to
resolve its debt and recover credibility so that it can become a player
in the emerging interactive television market.  In this market, programs
and software will be downloaded by service providers into cable-box-like
devices sitting on top of peoples' televisions. Commodore, the
shareholders insist, must become the supplier of the boxes or the core
technology going into compatible boxes supplied by other manufacturers.

"On the surface, every one of our objectives was met for the meeting,"
stated Marc Rifkin, a shareholder attending the meeting with proof of the
thousands of customers and shareholders backing his cause.  "We don't
think our warning fell on deaf ears; we now have an open line to Irving
Gould, and he seems willing to listen.  That is the critical first step."

What happens next?  Rifkin replies that either Commodore starts taking
the steps necessary to survive, or they don't.  The first sign will be
whether Commodore brings in someone who can deal with the daunting
financial and marketing challenges, as well as working with the Board of
Directors.  Previous attempts to find such a turn-around artist have
ended in debacles, most notably, an ex-Pepsico executive, who cost
Commodore a $10 million lawsuit, and current president, Medhi Ali who led
Commodore during its recent decline.

Commodore Shareholder Movement Announcement, March 2, 1994

We were at the shareholder meeting, and we were not alone.  Various Amiga
dealers whose livelihood depends on Commodore's success were also in
attendance.  Some spoke with along with us while others silently observed
the proceedings.

Our message was clear; things are not rosy.  Consistent and basic
mistakes led Commodore to where it is, and as anyone can plainly see,
continuing these mistakes will lead to ruin.  They must not miss their
one chance to make a comeback through the interactive television market.
This relies on partnerships which Commodore has seemed unable to form.
The situation is urgent.  Commodore must leverage what resources it still
has, including the activities of those customers who still carry the
torch.

Irving Gould met with us after the meeting to discuss what might be done.
It seems that Gould is willing to listen and is concerned about the
message which is reaching the users.  If there is a solution to
Commodore's situation, it must start from the top.  We hope to offer
Gould a solution which he will find favorable and will best benefit the
interests of the Commodore shareholders and customers whom we represent.

Keep your letters coming.  Keep them concise and focus on what things you
might do to help.  Most importantly, spread the word.  The assumption is
that Commodore and its computers represent a tradition worth keeping.  We
can not do this alone.  Others must become active leaders in the cause.

Editor's Addendum

I talked at length with Mike Levin, of the Commodore Shareholder
Movement, after the Annual Meeting, since I wanted to hear first-hand how
he felt the "encounter with Gould" had gone.  First, the bad news.  Mike
said that there had been "no fundamental change" in Commodore's
situation. Cash is still scarce, and there are a number of banks banging
at Commodore's door.  However, Levin felt that the opening of a "channel
of communication" with Gould was the most important accomplishment.  The
next order of business was for CSM to recommend "new leadership" for
Commodore, in a meeting with Gould.  This has already happened. The
candidate that CSM has proposed is a computer industry veteran (his son
was an Amiga developer) who has experience in turning ailing companies
around.

As for the future, Levin pointed out that it isn't nearly as bad as the
financial reports indicate.  While it is true that Commodore's financials
are dismal, the likelihood is that the people to whom Commodore owes
money will step in and take control of the company, rather than liquidate
it. As long as Commodore has sales, they're worth more alive than dead.

So the current (and prospective) Amiga owner need not necessarily fear
that his or her computer is about to be an orphan.  However, the Amiga
community does have a say in the future of the Amiga, and can take an
active role.  Levin urged all Amiga owners to send letters to the CSM, to
"spread the word" of the Amiga's capabilities to potential Amiga
customers, and to "help Commodore through this current situation."

Levin repeatedly stressed the possibilities of licensing the Amiga's
chipset and operating system to third parties, particularly for use in
the forthcoming "interactive television" technology.  And, according to
Levin, Commodore has been approached by more than one company looking to
use Amiga technology in their products.

                                 MegaD 3.2
                               by @{"Tom Cannon" link tomc}

MegaD is a disk utility that allows the user to manipulate files and
directories using windows, gadgets and menus. The graphic interface is
where MegaD excels, since its configuration is in the hands of the user.

MegaD is a shareware product.  No system requirements are stated, but
MegaD has more features under Workbench 2.0 or higher.  No installation
is necessary, simply unarchive it. AmigaGuide is used for the help system
and most of the documentation. When you press the HELP key, the
MegaD.guide file is accessed whenever you select a gadget or menu item.
It is an online help system that commercial software products should
implement. AmigaGuide files are provided for the main program, the AREXX
interface and the print spooler. The print spooler is not required and is
a separate download. The tutorial, which should be printed to preserve its
formatting, is quite thorough, including an index. Once you've read it you
will be quite comfortable with MegaD. The overall detail and quality of
the @{"documentation" system "$viewer pic1"} is excellent.

MegaD's interface uses gadgets, menus and windows to perform its
functions. The program can be run on the Workbench screen, in which case
the control window becomes an app window. When iconified, the program
icon acts as an app icon. This feature is quite powerful when used with
the Autoboot feature of the program. Autoboots create program controls
which allow data files to be run by double-clicking them in a directory
window. Some unique aspects of this feature are:

1. MegaD has an automatic feature for learning program controls.
2. You can have it ask you which program of several to use for a
   particular file type.
3. You can use your MegaD app icon on the Workbench screen to run all of
   your data files. It is like having a Multiview for all your applications!

The program also supports custom screens and virtual screens and has the
ability to place and size windows so that they will not overlap your
monitor view on virtual screens. However, support for varied system fonts
sizes is not yet completely bug-free and can result in some odd displays.
The program's control window can be used to perform all standard utility
needs. The gadgets are arranged to mimic the numeric keypad and are
hot-keyed to their location. Of course, this is completely configurable
including fonts and @{"color." system "$viewer pic2"}  The directory windows are
unlimited in the registered version and allow you to select multiple
source and destination directories. The directories and volumes are
buffered into memory but may be purged with a mouse click.

When you outgrow the standard control window, user gadgets are unlimited
and completely configurable. The gadget layouts (i.e. 1 x 7, 2 x 4, etc.)
are definable and their location on screen is remembered. Gadgets can be
designed to pop up with a hotkey and close after use. They can even be
configured to open other gadgets. They accept any of the 123 AREXX
commands. Menus can also be configured with the end result that you can
lay out the @{"screen" system "$viewer pic3"} in any way that suits your needs.

Major advantages

  Unsurpassed level of configuration
  Unlimited directory windows
  Excellent documentation
  Try before you buy

Major disadvantage

  Different from the 'typical' and therefore a longer learning curve

(__  __)                     by @{"Steve Plegge" link stevep}
  / /   
 / /  his is not your father's air combat simulator.
(_/  
In fact, it's not an air combat simulator at all. Make that:  Not *just*
an air combat simulator.  What it is, is an air combat simulator with
realistic flight simulator characteristics.  ("It's a floor wax!"  "No,
it's a dessert topping!")  What's the difference? The flight simulator
part of most air combat simulators is almost an afterthought, added on to
give the appearance of a realistic simulation. Call it point-and-shoot
air combat.  With FDP2, first you learn to fly the aircraft, then you
worry about dealing with the bad guys.

Speaking of bad guys, you've got your choice of them:  Up to 4 virtual
foes (at 8 different ability levels, from novice to ace), or you can dial
up a friend (?) and go at it with them.  You and your friend can also fly
together as @{"wingmen," system "$viewer mustang"} playing tag-team duel with the computer-generated
foes.  (There's a chat mode you can use to talk to your enemy / partner
while in flight.)

To get your flying and gunnery skills up to speed, a practice range with
a towed target is available.

FDP2 models 25 different WWII @{"aircraft," system "$viewer fd2"} plus gunners on a couple of them,
and a ground gunner firing AAA (anti-aircraft artillery).  The aircraft
are: American - F4U-1D, F2G, F6F-3, P-38L, P-47D, P-51D, P-61C; British -
Hurricane II, Spitfire Mk I/IX/XIV, Seafire II, Tempest V; Russian -
Yak-3; Japanese - A6M5a (Zero), KI84, N1K2, J7W; and German - Bf-109E,
Bf-109G6, FW-190A8, TA-152H, ME-262, ME-163B, ME-110G.  Each aircraft has
its own flying characteristics, including turn and climb rates, maximum
speed, weapons load, rate of fire, firepower, and damage vulnerability.

Along with your choice of aircraft, both yours and your foe's, you can
choose a land or sea environment, and any of several different locations.
You can even set up a second Amiga to be used as a "rear-view" machine.
You also get your choice of real or Star Wars gunnery, and unlimited ammo
if you want it.

Serious aerodynamics are used here.  Perhaps the best example is that of
high-speed (or accelerated) stalls.  Most folks think that stalls are a
low-speed phenomenon, which happen when a wing is moving too slow to keep
flying.  Airflow separates from the top of the wing, lift goes to zilch,
and the nose drops.  If this happens to one wing before the other, what
you've got here is the beginning of a spin.  (As the old saying goes, "To
go up, pull back on the stick.  To go down, pull back some more.")

Stalls can also happen at high speed.  No matter how fast you're going,
if you put too much angle of attack on the wing, it will stall.  FDP2
accurately models this.  Dammit.  ;-)  If you try to go *too* fast, you
enter the wonderful world of high-speed flutter.  Be sure your life
insurance is paid up!

Other nice touches abound.  If you're flying a twin-engine aircraft
(P-38, P-61, ME-110) and you get one engine shot out, you can tell which
engine is still running... as long as you have stereo speakers.  (Don't
ask me how I know this.  <g>)

Another touch of realism goes by the name of torque roll.  This is when
the aircraft rolls in the opposite direction of the propeller spin, and
can only be avoided by carefully setting the trim - but it only corrects
the roll at one combination of power, altitude, and airspeed. This is one
reason I prefer the P-38; the engines are counter-rotating, so the torque
effects cancel out.

Yet another bit of realism is the gunnery system.  You can't just put
your foe in the gunsight and pull the trigger; you have to lead him.
This is where the LCOS (Lead-Computing Optical Sight) comes in handy.  If
you get only a few hits on him (hits on you / hits on him are displayed
on each side of the gunsight), he may start to smoke.  Tactical note:
When dueling mutiple foes, I like to leave some of them wounded.  They're
less dangerous that way, and they're easier to find if they're leaving a
smoke trail.

You can buy the farm in several interesting ways.  Flying into the
terrain (ground, arch, columns, whatever) will do it.  You can also
(obviously) get shot down.  Or, if you really want to be creative, you
can hose down an opponent too close to you and have him blow up in your
face.  And even if you miss him, you can always engage in the classic
mid-air collision thump / spin / splat maneuver.

Once you do stick it in the dirt, you can replay up to 60 seconds,
depending on how much RAM lives in your Amiga.  Interesting and
informative, but not very good for morale.  ;-/

FDP2 supports digital (normal) and analog joysticks, with a top-hat
(a/k/a Madonna) switch used for view selection.  There are keyboard
controls for wheel brakes (left & right), catapult launch, flaps, landing
gear, hook, rudder, throttle, and view selection.  The joystick is used
for the normal elevator, ailerons, and gun firing.

FDP2 is very addictive, so here's a Public Service Announcement:  You know
you've been playing FDP2 too long when you find yourself stuck in morning
commute traffic, wondering about the roll rate of that Mustang in front of
you.  There is no known cure...

Instructional Media Design
by Nick Cook

The Amiga has won deserved fame as a video tool. However, our favorite
computer is well suited to create graphics for other heavily used, but
decidedly lower tech, presentation aides: @{"transparencies" link trans} and slides. This
article will discuss some basic design rules for creating those visuals.

The first step is to decide if you want transparencies or slides. Each one
has @{"advantages and disadvantages." link advant}

Once you've picked your media, the fun begins!

1. Give Us a KISS

The Prime Directive of any type of instructional media design is KISS (Keep
It Simple, Stupid). Audiences are fickle. They probably won't "appreciate"
all the work put into that highly complex effect, or worse yet, even notice
it all.

Sometimes external forces conspire to cancel your masterpieces. Recently, I
spoke at a national convention. I created my slides employing the Gradient,
Background effect in Art Department Pro. I carefully picked the palette
colors and arranged the "start" positions. The results were gorgeous: gold
lettering over a subtle gradient of pink and blue. Perhaps a little too
smugly, I showed off my results to my coworker fighting with Presentation
Perfect. Alas, the ambient light in the hotel ballroom (to allow the
audience to take notes) completely washed out my beautiful backgrounds.
Keeping it simple may have saved some disappointment.

"The simplest way is the best way" is also good design mantra. Following
the KISS prescription prevents infection by the dreaded:

2. "Look, Ma! No hands!" Syndrome

The Amiga is capable of remarkable graphics, no doubt about it. Sometimes
like kids with a new toy, we just gotta play with it. Just don't show your
playing to us all at once!

Remember when you first bought Print Shop? Posters with borders, 3D ornate
fonts, all plastered on top of tiled graphics? A colleague at work proudly
showed me his first PC- created transparency: graphics (that had little to
do with the topic), print and blocks of color covered virtually every
square. The Helm manual offers good advice: using too many styles can look
sloppy. Remember: Just because you can do something, you don't have to.

A good rule of thumb: use one dominant design element per visual. It could
be a headline or graphic, but this element should grab the viewer's
attention. Be consistent with your designs as well. Stick with the same
type style, layout, and colors throughout. This unifies your presentation.

Remember to select colors, images and fonts to support your presentation,
not supplant it. You've probably seen a wonderful, witty commercial, and
tell a friend about it the next day. But what's the product name's again?
If your audience pays more attention to your messenger instead of your
message, you've failed.

3. You Cannot NOT Communicate

Every element in your presentation communicates. Even seemingly mundane
items such as palettes and backgrounds must be chosen with their
communicative intent in mind. If you don't, you may send mixed messages, or
even create unintentional humor. For example, in one of my instructional
media design classes, a fellow student created a presentation on the Asian
cooking technique Korean barbecue. The  student tracked his production with
country and western music, apparently because of the "barbecue" name. The
juxtaposition of these rather distinct styles had the audience, to use BBS
parlance, ROTFL. Unfortunately, that was not the effect the producer had in
mind!

Some backgrounds (like the Weaves and Bricks in ProFills programs)
communicate a more casual "feel" than others (e.g., Textures). Likewise
with colors: a Magenta palette "says" something completely different from a
gray one. The easiest way to check out the effect of color and background
is to experiment. For example, for a recent speech I presented several
statistics. I cycled through most of ProFills until I settled on one of the
Stucco textures; it gave a more "professional" feel to the slides. Next I
tried out the various palettes, and choose the grays and tans for the same
reason.

4. Watch the Clutter!

According to people who study these things, it is best to present no more
than three new concepts per screen. Moore & Moore provide some @{"suggestions." link moore}

Beyond these limits, your audience may become overwhelmed. Not only that,
but the visual clutter up and becomes difficult to read. I attended a
crowded seminar by a person who's "big" in my field. To her audience of at
least 300, she put up a transparency which contained a full page of columns
and numbers. That was bad enough, but she proceeded to say things like "as
you can see with subject 25, his responses across the categories were..."
You could only see if you had binoculars!

For one presentation, I used a batch of statistics to argue my point. These
were displayed as a 3D bar graph in the source material. A 3D bar graph and
the Amiga! A match made in heaven, no? Well, no.

I recreated the graph. From close up, the graph was readable, if a little
crowded. I got up, and stood about six feet back from the screen (by the
way, this is the simplest method to check out your graphic before
production). From that distance, it was too small.

Translating the stats into a pie chart didn't help. I decided to alter my
presentation somewhat. I listed the statistics in order, from largest to
smallest, on three slides. The second statistic ("Other") was critical to
my argument, so I rendered that one in red to contrast against the others,
which were in off-white. During the presentation, I reversed the order of
these slides, and did a "count down" a la Family Feud.

5. Three Coins in a FONTain

There are three factors you'll need to consider when picking a font,
including size, color, and format. Why format? Output methods are different
for transparencies and slides, and the font's format will influence the
visual's quality.

Most transparencies are produced by printing: either directly on the
acetate by a dot matrix or laser printer, or by printing on plain white
stock which is run through a photocopier loaded with transparency film. In
either case, you'll want to output the visual at the highest quality level
possible with your printer to avoid the jaggies. PostScript or Compugraphic
fonts are your best bet. You can print a transparency in portrait or
landscape orientation. I have found, however, that the landscape
orientation is slightly harder to fit on the overhead projector's "stage,"
and there's a greater possibility for chopping off material at either end.

If you're creating slides from bitmap images (e.g., a slide created in
Deluxe Paint), it is best to stick to bitmap fonts. A film recorder puts an
image on a 35mm slide using a grid of 4096x2732 pixels. This is quite a bit
higher than an Amiga high resolution screen of 640x400 pixels!
Consequently, the finished slide will be much sharper than the image you
see on the monitor. I received an unpleasant surprise when my first set of
slides came from the service bureau: the fonts, which I converted from
Compugraphic to bitmap, looked great on a high res screen. However, some
jaggies when the graphic was recorded in the film recorder's high
resolution. After the fact, I discovered that Gold Disk's Outline Fonts
manual contains a table of suggested vertical and horizontal dots per inch
(dpi) when using their conversion program. For high res screens, the manual
suggests 72 dpi for both horizontal and vertical. I didn't repeat my
mistake the next time, though. I dug through my 600 Amiga Fonts disks and
discovered the "Beverly Hills" font in a size appropriate for my visuals.
This time, no jaggies reared their ugly heads on the processed slides.

Select fonts for their clarity. Avoid the fancy ones, no matter how pretty.
I've used "Avant Garde" for one presentation, because it had a "clean"
look, and "Beverly Hills," an elegant font, for another one. Also beware of
"skinny" fonts. They are harder to read on the screen. Last week, I made
some transparencies about an hour before a presentation. I was in a hurry,
so I selected a font, slapped together the layout in PageStream, then
printed them by way of the laser printer. During the talk, I noticed that I
had picked a "skinny" font; the words almost disappeared in the glare of
the overhead projector's light. The font looked fine in the sample book,
but because I was in a hurry, I didn't perform the "step back from the
monitor test."

Also consider the interaction between font and background color. Dark type
on light backgrounds is best for transparencies, whereas light type on dark
backgrounds works for slides. Avoid red type on a blue background or vice
versa, as it is very hard to read.

If the graphic is seen by a large audience, font size is important. Twelve
points is the absolute minimum, with 24 point and up better. "Remember, you
are 'writing' on a 35mm slide, not an 8.5 x 11 piece of paper!" advises Kip
Hammond of Culver City, California's Hammond Photographic Services.

6. Heat and Enjoy!

Follow these basic design rules, and you can create some professional
graphics for your speech. Have fun!

Transparencies are 8 by 10 sheets of acetate or plastic used with
overhead projectors. Also known as "overheads".

@endnode

@node advant

Transparencies:
     - inexpensive and easy to produce
     - work best for small audiences numbering under 50.
     - allow the presenter to "disclose" the contents by covering the
       transparency with a sheet of paper and sliding it down.

Slides:
     - not cheap! You may get a good rate by saving your graphic as a
       GIF or TIFF in a PC resolution and using a PC service bureau.
     - require at least a 24 hour turnaround
     - provide a formal, professional "feel" to a presentation
     - work best in audiences with over 50 members

           The Settlers - Economics 201 (How To Win the Game)
    ____                      by @{"Eric Penn" link ericp}
   (_  _)
    / / have found that the best way to view the structure of the game is
   / / from a `bottom-up' perspective.  Think about the END PRODUCTS you
 _/ /  want, and then work backwards from there.  So, having said that....
(____) 
The key to the game is amassing land and military strength.  In order to
"win" you must control over 75% of the map and have over 75% of the
Knights.

Knights need three things, from two different systems:

I. Sword and shield (without these they cannot be Knights).
   Both come from the Armourer who needs:
   A. Coal, which comes from a Coal-mine, and
   B. Steel, which is created in a Steel-forge which needs:
      1. Iron-ore, from an Iron-mine, and
      2. Coal, from a Coal-mine.  And II. Gold (which raises their morale
         and makes them fight -significantly-
         better).  Gold is produced by a Gold-forge, which requires:
    A. Gold-ore, from a Gold-mine, and
    B. Coal, from a Coal-mine.

So, essentially, each Knight is equivalent to the following raw material:
  5 Coal
  2 Iron-ore
  1 Gold-ore

However, the Miners that produce ALL of these raw materials require food
in order to do their work.  Food can come in one of three forms, each of
which comes from a different system:

I. Fish, from a fisherman.  This only requires a single building, but
   fish only reproduce at a set rate.  Too many fishermen will over-fish
   a single body of water, which will render it "dead", and no more fish
   will be caught.  A lake the size of the entire screen is large enough
   to support two fishermen, without over-fishing.  Or,

II. Meat, which is the product of a Butcher.  Butchers require only a
    single raw material (a pig) to produce Meat  Pigs come from a
    Pig-farm, which requires Wheat from a Wheat-farm.  At _minimum_ this
    requires three large buildings, one of which (Wheat-farm) needs to be
    near a large semi-level area.  I have not yet determined the optimal
    mix for this system.  Or,

III. Bread, which is made by a Baker.  Flour, which comes from a
     Windmill, is the sole input needed by the Baker.  The miller
     requires Wheat, which comes from a Wheat-farm.  At _minimum_ this
     requires one small building (the Windmill) and two large buildings
     (the Bakery and the Wheat-farm), and a nearby large semi-level area
     for the Farmer's wheat crops.  Optimally, one Baker can work fast
     enough to support two millers.  In order to keep both millers
     working continually, the dedicated output of three Wheat-farms is
     needed.  This mix will ensure a constant and continual output of
     food.

So far, we have discussed the needs of Knights (needed to win the game),
Miners (who are needed to support the knights), and food production
(required by the Miners).  These three eco-systems are all that is
required to win the game.  However, in order to construct the buildings
that are required to build the products needed, and the buildings which
will house the knights themselves, one must have three things:

I. Building materials.  These come in two forms:
   A. Timber, which is produced by a Joiner (???) at a Sawmill.  The
      Sawmill uses tree Trunks, which come from a Woodcutter.  A single
      Sawmill can cut enough wood to support three Woodcutters.  However,
      three Woodcutters will denude even the densest forest in a very
      short time frame.  A Forester will plant new trees, so placing
      one near each woodcutter will make a self sustaining wood
      production unit.  And,
   B. Stones, which can come from two sources:
      1. a Stonecutter will break the large grey blocks found on the
         landscape into usable Stones.  But when these are gone, they are
         gone.  Or,
      2. a Stone-mine will dig the Stones from the bowels of the land.
         Obviously, the Miner will require food.  Again, when the source
         of mined Stones runs dry, there can be no more produced.

II. Manpower.  New Settlers are made... in the way that new people are
    made. This costs nothing except time.  Settlers always start out in
    the Castle or in Stock houses.

III. Tools.  Each `job' that a new Settler can take requires one or more
     tools.  If the requisite tool is not available, no new Settler can
     take that job.  For example, if there is no Axe in storage, then
     no Woodcutter can be made.  You can still build the building for
     one, but no Settler will go to live in it and nothing will be
     produced by it.
     Tools are created by a Toolmaker who requires:
     A. Timber, and
     B. Iron.

When viewed in the `bottom-up' perspective, economic planning is much
easier.  Place buildings which are inter-dependant near each other, with a
connecting road with no intersections.  Avoid road intersections where
supply routes cross.

Most materials are already present in small quantities in your Castle
store-rooms; use these to supply end-product workers while you plan and
build the mid- and raw-material professions.  Thus you can build a Butcher
shop right away, Pig-farm (or two) next, and finally, several Wheat-farms.
Build your eco-systems from the bottom up.

I hope you found this mini-tutorial interesting and useful.  I don't know
how complete the demo version is, so I cannot vouch for it.  The actual
game comes with a 138 page BOOK that explains each ecosystem and all of the
menus and options in great detail.  And there a LOT of options that can be
set, each of which will vary depending on play style, landscape, and enemy
placement.  Buy it, you fools!

 ______              Making a LOGO Translator in HELM
(__  __)                   by @{"Scott Nickerson" link scottn}
  / /   
 / /  he scripting language in Helm has some interesting features that
(_/  are not used very often. Two of these features are the ability to
draw directly on a page, outside of an imagefield, and the ability to
compile a script on the fly. In this tutorial, we will show how you can
use these features to build a simple LOGO language translator that
includes turtle graphics.

Before beginning to construct the actual LOGO translator, you should
become familiar with Helm's paint commands that are described in Chapter
37, Paint Commands, in the Helm Reference Manual. These commands are
unique because they direct Helm's painting tools; they do not have a
painting engine of their own. These means that you can take advantage of
the various painting modes by simply setting the painttype property and
then using one of the draw commands.

In the LOGO application, we will use two of these commands: drawline and
fillbox. Take note of the syntax and arguments of these commands...

drawline <x>, <y>, <x1>, <y1>

This command draws a line on the screen using the current pen color and
the current paint type. The coordinates x-y and x1-y1 are the end points
of the line.

fillbox <x>, <y>, <x1>, <y1>

This command draws a filled rectangle. One corner of the rectangle is
located at x-y. Another corner of the rectangle that is diagonally
opposite of the first corner is located at x1-y1. We will use this
command merely to clear the drawing area.

These commands will paint on the page only if there is no imagefield on
the page. Make sure that there is no imagefield. This will not be a
limitation in future versions of Helm.

LOGO was devised as a simple language to teach children how to program.
The concept of turtle graphics is an important part of LOGO.   The child
programmer gives commands to a turtle to go forward, turn left, and so on.

The turtle draws as it moves, leaving a line in its wake. This gives the
child a more concrete way of dealing with graphics, rather than having to
imagine the more abstract Cartesian coordinate system.

The algorithm for the turtle graphics engine is fairly straightforward.
We will merely take advantage of the equations for converting polar
coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. Given our current position, a
distance to move (dis), and an angle in which to move (ang), we can
determine the location of a turtle after movement with the following
equations:

  x = cos d * dis + x
  y = sin d * dis + y

We must remember to keep the variables x, y, and d in global variables.
Also, Helm's math functions require angles in radians so we must convert
any angle given in degrees to radians using the equation:

  ang = ang / 180.0 * 3.1415927

We should also make sure that the angle falls within an acceptable range
of angles by using an if-else construction:

if ang < 0        then ang = 360.0 + ang
  else if ang > 360 then ang = ang - 360.0

Pulling these equations all together, we can construct a simple turtle
graphics function.

  moveturtle dis
  begin
    global x, y, ang

    if ang < 0        then put 360.0 + ang into ang  // Make sure angle
    else if ang > 360 then put ang - 360   into ang  // is in range.

    put ang / 180.0 * 3.1415927 into ang             // convert to radians

    x1 = cos ang * dis + x                           // find new location
    y1 = sin ang * dis + y

    drawline x, y, x1, y1                            // draw line
    x = x1
    y = y1
  end                                                 //

Now that we have a basic turtle graphics engine, we can easily move the
turtle pen around with other very simple commands. For example, to move
the direction of the turtle 45 degrees to the right, subtract 45 from the
global container dir; to move forward 10, call the moveturtle function
using an argument of 10; to set the position of the turtle pen, just put
new numbers into the global x and y containers.

Helm will translate the LOGO program a line at a time into Helm's script
language, adding each new group of Helm statements to a string. When the
translation is complete, a "set" command will set the script of the form
to the string. Helm will automatically compile the script at this point
(A similar method of dynamically creating scripts is used in the
PlotBook, an example application that comes with the Helm package. It
evaluates mathematical expressions by simply inserting the equation into
a script and having Helm compile and execute the script).

Before we create the translator itself, we need to more clearly define
the LOGO syntax it will recognize. It is easy to translate program
statements if only a single statement can occupy a single line of code.
Also, it is even easier if the commands take the form of a command
keyword followed by an optional argument:

  <command> <optional argument>

Consequently, we only have to get the first word of each line to determine
the command. The argument will be the words that follow the first word of
the line. For example, the command to move forward 10 pixels in LOGO is
"Forward 10." To parse this expression in Helm we can write a few simple
commands:

  put "Forward 10" into theLine  // In the translator, theLine will
                                 // actually be gotten from a line of
                                 // program code.
  get the number of words of theLine
  if it > 0 then begin
    put word 1 of theLine into cmd
    put word 1 to it into arg
  end

Now, that was pretty easy. A more complex syntax would not be so simple
but, for this application we will follow the format of one statement per
line. Here is the syntax we designed for this very modest implementation of
LOGO:

  Command                           Use
  ------------------------------    ------------------------------
  FORWARD <steps>                   Move the turtle forward
  BACKWARD <steps>                  Move the turtle backward
  RIGHT <degrees>                   Turn the turtle to the right
  LEFT <degrees>                    Turn the turtle to the left
  PENUP                             The turtle stops drawing as it moves
  PENDOWN                           The turtle starts drawing as it moves
  HOME                              Move the turtle to the center position
  COLOR <color number: 0 - 7>       Sets the color of the drawing pen
  MAKE <variable> = <expression>    Set the value of a variable
  TO ... END                        The start of a function
  REPEAT ... END                    Repeats the statement block

To parse an entire LOGO program, we simply put the parser that we
developed into a for-loop that loops as many times as there are lines in
the LOGO program. Given that the program is kept in textfield "Program,"
we can construct an example of this loop...

on SelectUp begin
  global x, y, ang
  put "LOGOfunc begin\n" into theCode
  put textfield "Program" into theProgram  // Putting the contents of
                                           // a textfield that would other
                                           // be frequently referenced, will
                                           // greatly speed script execution.
  put the number of line of theProgram into numlines
  for n = 1 to numline begin
    get the number of words of theLine
    if it > 0 then begin
      put word 1 of theLine into cmd
      put word 1 to it into arg
    end
    if cmd = "Forward" begin
      put "moveturtle(arg)\n" after theCode
    end
    else if cmd = "Right" begin
      put "subtract arg from ang\n" after theCode
    end
    else if cmd = "Left" begin
      put "add arg to ang\n" after theCode
    end
    else begin
      answer "Cannot understand keyword."
      exit
    end
  end
  put "end\n" after theCode
  set the script of this form to theCode
  LOGOfunc()
end

As you can see from this function, Helm stores the new script in a
container called "theCode". It consists of a dynamically created function
called LOGOfunc() After it is constructed, the translator attaches the
script to the form and Helm compiles it. Then this newly compiled
function is called. As it runs, you should see the artwork created by the
movement of the turtle.

VPLOGO is only a very tiny subset of LOGO. However, you can enhance it by
translating additional statements or you can use the principles of this
application to create translators for other languages. Your language will
run quickly because even the HelmBrowser includes the entire Helm
compiler and interpreter. You simply let Helm do the compiling for you.
The ability to compile scripts on the fly also has implications for
future versions of Helm.

The next major version of Helm will include capabilities for communications
using the serial and parallel ports. You could create a custom script
language that is used for programs that are transmitted from one computer
to another. These custom programs can be instantly compiled and executed
when they arrive at their destination sites. For instance, it would be
possible to create a special language for presentation graphics. A Helm
application will create the presentation at one site and update remote
sites by sending programs written in the custom language. The destination
Helm book will receive the program and instantly translate it into a Helm
script and run it. The presentation will change seamlessly as the new
program is executed.

      The *StarShip*'s Featured Amiga Artist in Residence for March
            In an electronic exhibit at Gallery 44:  Zak Jarvis
    _____                   by deb Christensen
   / _   )
  / / ) /ur Amiga Artist in Residence for March, Zak Jarvis, is one of
 / (_/ / those people that the original Amiga advertising slogan "The
(_____/ Computer For The Creative Mind" was made for.  He's had an Amiga
since 1988, and currently uses an Amiga 1200 and an Amiga 2500. Resisting
all influences of the burgeoning computer marketplace to move to another
platform, Zak has remained an avid Amiga fan. He refers to himself as "an
artist/writer/game designer" and a "loyal Amiga fanatic."

Zak's first art was with a computer, and it continues to be that way today.
Like many traditional artists, who study the structures and media of
conventional drawing and art techniques, Zak studies the tools and
techniques of computer art. His sketches don't start on a piece of paper in
a bound sketchbook, but directly on the screen where the Amiga and the
mouse give life to his visions.

Influenced by artists with and without computers, Zak finds the work of Jim
Sachs, Louis Markoya, Bill Graham and Menzies inspiring. Like many of the
rest of us, he finds much to admire in many pieces of drawn and rendered
art, some of it even unsigned. When it comes to more traditional art forms,
he enjoys Bosch, Goya, Maxfield Parish, Pierre Paul Vever and Rene Lalique.

You can see some of his production work and style in three of the first
issues of the Amiga version of GEnie's LiveWire magazine, the November,
December and January issues. Of the ones he worked on, his personal
favorite is the December one, where he tried to create the atmosphere of a
futuristic cyber-link monitor in the colors and framing of the artwork and
interface surrounding the presentation of the articles. You can still
download the back issues at GEnie page 20, for free even, and see his
beautiful animations and main clip art and small clip arts featured in the
December issue. I helped him work on that issue, and I think he has every
reason to be very proud of it, too.  The spinning globe inside a holocube
was featured on two pages in the issue, and is a great example of a
beautiful and compact animation. Who can forget the awesome opening screen
power button he created to set the mood for the entire December LiveWire,
or the blinking LED-like glowing fonts which proclaimed the titles, bylines
and navigation limit indicators?

Zak just finished the album cover for Eric "SideWinder" Gieseke's first CD
album of music - all produced and written on an Amiga - "Future Shock 2".
You can take a peek at what the CD jacket art will look like; the picture
is part of Zak's exhibit online in the *StarShip*. It's a futuristic
landscape, only the landscape is a circuit board. I think you'll find it
intriguing.  Zak created the imagery with Imagine.

In addition to his love for and talent with computer arts, Zak is currently
developing a multiplayer game with his girlfriend of several years, Sharon.
They live in Syracuse, NY, and share an apartment with his two Amigas, her
Macintoshes, and one very dumb cat, Pilgrim. I'd call that a progressive
and tolerant household!  :)

Most of Zak's Amiga artistry is done with DPaint IV and Imagine 2.0.
Sometimes he uses Brilliance. He calls his Bernoulli an 'indispensable'
tool, and has been going on and on about a new Canon BubbleJet 200 printer.
One of the time saving and often-used features of his Amiga systems is
Parnet, which networks his two Amigas together.

You'll find Zak's work in the March Multimedia ViewPort - the severed
parallel cable in The Amigaphile, the jukebox scene in the Blues Machine,
as well as the design of the Contents page and the general look of the
issue.

Look for Zak's art on display in our own Gallery 44, an electronic art
exhibit in these files:


  13089 BALLRMJP.LZH          57,600   Still: 24bit JPeg of a ballroom.
  12576 DARKNESS.LZH          18,816   Still:  A picture of suffering.
  12673 SKELE2.LZH           111,616   An animation of a skeleton hand.
  13237 GREATSWORD.LZH       284,928   Spinning ornate sword anim
  20789 BIOSHIPANIM.LHA      931,200   Ham-8 anim of Bio spaceship.
  22713 POWERPC_ANIM.LHA      30,848   It's Square, silicon, & it moves!
  22716 AMIGA_AD.LZH           6,144   Still: Ad you're not likely to see.


You'll be able to share these pictures with your non-Amiga friends, look
for the GIF and JPEG versions which will be available in Gallery 44 soon.


If you think your project could benefit from an artist of Zak's calibre,
contact him. He's taking work on now in 2 or 3-D animations and in stills.

@node robin

Mr. (as in Robin Hood, in case you were wondering) Evans has, in his
checkered past, sprayed asbestos onto the ceilings of mobile homes and
designed databases for lawyers (two activities that seem somehow
related). Between those periods, he edited a biweekly community
newspaper in Seattle and typeset enough headlines and stories on a
CompuGraphic EditWriter 7500 to realize that computers could be nifty
things after all.

He was a serious enough philosophy major in college (a time when he
thought that computers just might be evil) that he can still give a
passable definition of "epistomology" or "ontology."

He moved up from a C-64 to his first Amiga (a 500) in 1988 and bought
ARexx shortly thereafter. When he discovered what could be done with
ARexx by itself and ARexx with TxEd, he was hooked.

Evans recently release ARexxGuide 2.0, a complete shareware reference and
tutorial to ARexx in AmigaGuide format. It is available in the GEnie
libraries under the name ARexxGuide2_0.lha, file #22745 (the regular

He teaches an introductory class in ARexx programming in
CALC, GEnie's online community college.

There wasn't time to finish up the Emplant vs. A-Max IV series.  The good
news is that A-Max IV now works with "fast" machines, like the A4000.  On
the Emplant front, much has changed - you can now cut and paste between the
Mac and the Amiga,for example.  We'll wrap this series up next issue.

We're always looking for material, by the way.  If you'd like to contribute

@Node setup

If you want to use a viewer other than WDisplay and you see it on one of the
buttons below, click on that button.  There's no real magic involved here.
All we do is change the Environment Variable we use (viewer) to call the
viewer.  If you don't see your viewer on the list below, you can simply
flip to a Shell and issue the command yourself:

 SetEnv viewer <name of your viewer>

Note that this viewer MUST be in your current path!


    @{" Multiview " system "SetEnv viewer Multiview"}
    @{"    VT     " system "SetEnv viewer VT"}
    @{"  Mostra   " system "SetEnv viewer Mostra"}
    @{"   View    " system "SetEnv viewer View"}
    @{"  C-Show   " system "SetEnv viewer C-Show"}
    @{"   Show    " system "SetEnv viewer Show"}
    @{" SuperView " system "SetEnv viewer SuperView"}
    @{"    SV     " system "SetEnv viewer SV"}
    @{" Display39 " system "SetEnv viewer Display39"}
    @{"  Display  " system "SetEnv viewer Display"}
    @{" WDisplay  " system "alias WDisplay WDisplay"}

 One more note:  Environment Variables have been part of the system since
 Workbench 1.3.  To utilize them, your startup-sequence makes a directory
 named ENV and performs an assign (Assign ENV: Ram:ENV).  If you have any
 problems, please ensure that ENV has been created and is properly assigned.
 Then, make sure that AmigaDOS can find everything.  ViewPort and the
 graphics should be in the same directory, and this should be your Current
 Directory.  Finally, AmigaDOS must be able to find the viewer you choose,
 either by searching the Current Directory or the Paths.

 You don't really have to go through all this, if you have 2.04 or
greater.  You can simply use the MAKELINK command to create a link - a
"virtual file" that points to the viewer of your choice.

Let's say that you want to use VT instead of WDisplay.  We'll assume that
you keep VT in the SYS:Utilities directory.  First, CD to Sys:Utilities.
Then, make sure that you don't already have a file called WDisplay.  If
you do, either rename it, move it, or delete it.  Otherwise, you'll get a
"object already exists" error.  Then, type this command into the shell:

 makelink wdisplay multiview

(Remember - you first create the link (WDisplay) and then indicate which
file you want to link to.)  Now, do a DIR.  You should see a <hl> next to
WDisplay.  This indicates that it's not a file, but a link to another
file.  You only need to do this once.  From then on, every time you call
WDisplay, you'll really be calling VT instead.

 If you encounter any problems (other than a balky viewer that doesn't
 like our directives), please @{" contact " link jimm} me.
