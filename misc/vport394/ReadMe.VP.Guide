@node Main "About *StarShip* Viewport"

 Welcome to the AmigaGuide version of ViewPort!  You'll need a viewer
 capable of understanding AmigaGuide files if you want to view this file
 correctly.  We recommend AmigaGuide, of course.  You'll find the complete
 AmigaGuide kit, including versions for 1.3, 2.x, and 3.x, in the GEnie
 *StarShip* library:

 File #21302 AMIGAGUIDE_V346.LHA  270,464 bytes

 It's a big file, but you only need to get it once.  (Commodore requires
 that the entire archive be kept intact.  This file includes the program,
 documentation, source code, examples, and utilities.)

 You MUST have Workbench 1.3 or greater to use AmigaGuide.

 The text in this archive will be readable through normal means, but it
 will be cluttered with AmigaGuide commands.  If you don't have an
 AmigaGuide-compatible viewer and don't plan to get one, you'll find the
 "normal" version of ViewPort much better suited to your purposes.

 NOTE:  The icon supplied with this archive does not specify the location
of AmigaGuide, by popular demand.  This means that AmigaGuide MUST be in
your search path!  AmigaGuide "normally" resides in SYS:UTILITIES, and
that location is part of the default search path.


 This ViewPort archive contains all the graphics called by the .guide
document.  Because the viewer program is now configurable (the default
program is WDisplay), we have no way of predicting what error message
you'll get if the graphics are unavailable.  Something will happen,
though - it usually does!

BIf you have a problem viewing the graphics, the USUAL solution is to make
sure that both ViewPort and the VPXtra files are in the same directory,
and that you have CDed to that directory.  Example:

 CD DH1:ViewPort

Additional "debugging" information is available within ViewPort.

Since the graphics -are- important, and since WDisplay isn't an adequate
solution for folks running a Workbench with fewer than 16 colors, we
have now given you the capability to use the viewer of your choice.

Please note the "Click Me To Enable Graphics" button when you enter
ViewPort.  This is important!  You MUST click this to enable the
Environment Variable we use to call the viewer.

If you are running 1.3 or later - which you must, to use the AmigaGuide
version - your system supports Environment Variables.  We've included
a list of the most popular viewers - at least the ones that sprung to
mind - in a special Setup section.  You'll find a button to take you to
this section in the Table of Contents, and more instructions are listed
there.

If you have any problems with the new Environment Variable method of
calling a viewer, don't hesitate to contact me via GEnie Email or
Internet.  We want to make ViewPort the ultimate online news
experience, and we are constantly exploring new avenues of delivery
for ViewPort.

  Feel free to reprint and/or repost ViewPort as long as you do so in its
  entirety.

 If you do reprint ViewPort, please drop me a line.  We'd like to know who
 you are, and - if possible - we'd like to see your newsletter, too.
 We're also interested in submissions and feedback.  Again, drop me a line
 on GEnie.  My mail address is JIM.MEYER, or I can be reached at this
 Internet address: jimm@genie.geis.com.
