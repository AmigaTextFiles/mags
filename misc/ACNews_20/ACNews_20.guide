@node not01 "AMIGA2K SHOW: BANQUET REPORT"
                          AMIGA2K SHOW: BANQUET REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mark Abraham (mark@everstar.com) from Amiga Users Group Kansas City, attended
the bamnquet at the A2K show, and this is the show report he has written. At the
end of the article, you will find links to other show reports.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Banquet Report

Essentially Bill reviewed what has been going on over the past three months and
apparently they have several partnerships/agreements they will be announcing in
less than a week.

These include relationships with Sun, RedHat, Sony, Motorola, JVC, DCE, Corel,
ACT, Espial, H&P, Hyperion, JVC, Amiga Development, Crystal Software, Digital
Images, Epic, Met@box, Titan, and others. A strong point of these relationships,
NO PC Money.

It seems that as well as focusing on the future, that Bill is also trying to get
the present back in order. This includes getting distribution going again, new
products for the existing Amiga lines, and trying to reduce cost to ease the
pain on consumers.

It looks like they have an agreement on the Boxer, and are going to help move it
forward. It also sounds like they are trying to insure that accelerator cards
become more available so people can use their existing 1200's, 4000's etc with
the new OE. A PPC will be needed to run the new OE.

They also gave an impressive demo on the TAO technology running under Linux. The
demo clearly demonstrated the power or the TAO relationship and why companies
like SUN, RedHat and Corel are interested. In Summary, TAO has found a way to
make JAVA FAST! We saw 4 simultaneous versions, of doom and quake, running
simultaneously under the TAO technology.

It would appear that the way the Amiga will move forward is as an Environment
running on top of other platforms. The holy grail of this is that games and
applications will be easily ported to multiple platforms via the environment. A
BONG ball will symbolize Amiga compatibility. Think in terms of Phones, PDA's,
PC's, and yes even new Amiga's.

It would appear that eventually we will get new Amiga's. Bill demonstrated some
cool concept designs to us that were created by some of the Animators/Artist at
Disney. These focused on a new Tower, Desktop, Server and Game Console designs.
They were different and had a very futuristic looking design, with the servers
being round and stackable. An interesting point was that Disney donated these
designs for free in a show of support for their favorite animation design
platform.

If you look at the relationships that are being created and their significance,
essentially you have JAVA nailed down with SUN's backing and TAO's twist on
performance and portability. You have Redhat as a powerful distribution channel
to deliver to users world wide, you have Corel with Java based applications
which will undoubtedly benefit from the TAO technology and give us new
office/productivity apps, and finally a series of Appliance manufactures from
Phones to Stereos to computers backing the venture from a hardware perspective.
These alliances will also serve as powerful distribution channels for the new
Amiga Inc.

One pitfall to consider is that Java has promised cross platform compatibility
in the past and yet has not been able to deliver it's promise. From the looks of
it though, TAO seems to have this addressed already with several platforms.

I think another insight worth looking at quickly is the relationships that Bill
is building with the people that work for him. He has fostered a spirit that
makes it fun to work at Amiga Inc, where ideas and creativity are welcome and
the people seem to really enjoy working there.

I have already seen in the news rumors of release dates on new machines and
products and I want to stress that no dates or promises of when were given by
Bill. Rumors are damaging to the Amiga community and set an expectation that
can't and won't be met. This usually results in negative feelings and can
seriously damage a companies ability to deliver products.

Bill appears to have operations and strategies under control. He has put
together a tremendous vision, and he has gained an amazing amount of support.
All that has been presented here in this report plus a lot more, has been done
in only 3 months. Bill said, "let's see what the next three months bring", and I
think we ought to give Bill that chance without the pressure and disruption that
rumors cause.

In conclusion, if Bill follows through, the vision for a new Amiga is very
powerful, and apparently by his lack of concern for funding, these companies are
backing him with more than words. He has vowed to retain controlling interest in
the new company. He has vowed that he will not create a power hungry giant like
Microsoft ruling all aspects of the market that surround the platforms and
environment. Finally he stressed the importance of non PC money in the venture.

While the finish line remains to be seen, I think we may actually have lift off!
A little more time will tell.

VP Amiga Users Group Kansas City

@node not03 "AMIGA FORMAT: THE CRONIC OF AN ANNOUNCED DEATH"
                 AMIGA FORMAT: THE CRONIC OF AN ANNOUNCED DEATH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's been a very sad month for me. Since I found out that AF was to close, I've
had nothing but sleepless nights and now you've all found out in the worst way
possible, when I thought I should be the one breaking the terrible news.
Future's policy was to keep silent until the issue had finally gone to press,
but now there seems little point, and in a way, I'm glad - there was nothing
worse than me having to prevaricate about subscriptions or future plans for
Amiga Format.

The closure of Amiga Format means the end of an era for me. For thirteen years
(pretty much my whole working life) I've been involved with the Amiga market in
some capacity, whether that be in sales, distribution, freelance consultant and
writer, or journalist and editor on Amiga Computing or Amiga Format. All this
time I've been at the heart of the Amiga market and I've met and got to know
some fantastic people, not least of whom are my readers. I've used some
fantastic software and seen hardware dreams come and go. I've probably spent in
excess of ten grand feeding my obsession and will carry on using the equipment I
have at home for a long time to come. As for what I will be doing, you have no
cause to fear on my or Richard's behalf: Rich has a job on Linux Format as a
staff writer, working with erstwhile Amiga Format editor Nick Veitch. As for me,
I hope you'll look favourably on Future's new launch - 3D World - where I'll be
deputy editor and the editor of its website. 3D World will be aimed at
professional 3D artists and those looking to get into that market, whatever the
platform. I will be honest and say that although the only important criterion
for inclusion in 3D World is image quality, the speed at which those images need
to be rendered, and the quality of the support software, means that I don't
think there'll be much, if any, Amiga coverage and that saddens me too.

For those of you who are subscribers, there's no cause for alarm. We aren't a
fly-by-night company that will let you down when it comes to dealing with your
subscription. All subscribers will get a letter shortly - included with your
final subscription issue, that will explain all the options.

As far as any future reincarnation of Amiga Format goes, I am not yet personally
convinced that Bill and Fleecy will be able to achieve all they want to, but if
they do succeed I'm sure that Future Publishing will be one of the first
publishers back into a new thriving Amiga market, and you can bet I'd want to be
back. As such, although my new job will probably take me into the world of PCs
and workstations, you can be sure I'll keep an eye on what's going on here and
I've promised Bill McEwen I would remain part of the AAC in order to be better
able to tell him where I think he's going wrong. :)

In the meantime, I don't think that the Amiga market has died, I just know it's
got to the stage where Future Publishing can't sustain Amiga Format. At the end
of the day, the only reasons for this are an increasing unprofessionalism in the
marketplace and a lack of people willing to part with their money. There are
plenty of good dealers out there that have their customers interests at heart
and it's up to you to make sure that their level of service and support don't go
the way of Amiga Format.

Just remember, there's still an issue on the shelves right now that contains all
sorts of fantastic info (and Personal Paint 7.1b on the CD) and our next issue
on sale, our last, will be well worth buying since it will contain a dissection
of the Amiga market as the freelancers and staff on AF see it and a history of
AF.

On a personal note, it's not so easy to convey emotion while writing an email.
Suffice to say that this page would be wet if it were a letter I was sending to
you all.

             ALIVE MEDIASOFT - RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENT 23RD MARCH 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   - TITLE: Super Taekwondo Master
   - PRICE: £14.99
   - RELEASE DATE: April 2000
   - BRIEF DESCRIPTION: 2D Beat 'em up
   - REQUIRES: AGA CDrom

Super Taekwondo Master is a 2d action simulator for 1 or 2 players. Fully
digitised characters, superimposed into a computer generated world in spendid
graphical glory. The look is similar to that of Mortal Kombat, but the gameplay
is more realistic. There's no hurling fireballs at your enemy here, you must be
a competant fighter to take on these guys. Strategy and skill are utmost
importance in Taekwondo Master.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   - TITLE: Cedric and the Search for the Magic Sceptre
   - PRICE: £14.99
   - RELEASE DATE: Out Now
   - BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Jump and Run Adventure
   - REQUIRES: AGA CDrom

Accompany Cedric on his dangerous way through 11 giant levels searching for the
lost sceptre. Explore islands, search through cities, survive the sudden
winters, cross huge lava lakes, fight against the mighty bosses and seek out
justice.

You play the title role of our hero Cedric who is a poor apprentice blacksmith
working for The King. You are madly in love with the kings daughter - as she is
with you - but her father will not permit her marriage to a peasant boy. Then
the day comes where you are given the opportunity to gain credability with your
would-be father in law and rescue his magic sceptre which has been stolen by his
arch enemy Edi W Le Mac. So, you start you quest stranded in the woods after
being robbed of all your possesions. You begin your journey across the lands
looking for the magic sceptre, fighting bad guys bare handed.

As you can see from the screenshots, this is played on platforms similar to
Shadow of the Beast or Lion Heart. However, the action forms only part of the
game as the rest is played in a traditional point-and-click stlye like Monkey
Island, whereby you can hold objects you find in an inventory to be used later
on in your quest. You can look at items, talk to characters, give, drop, take,
use etc. All the usual point and click features incorporated into an exciting
non-stop action game. You play using a joypad (Cedric is also CD32 pad
compatible), and there's no set route so you're open to explore each level at
your leisure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also released this week was Giana Twins - previously known The Great Giana
Trilogy.

Giana Twins Includes:

   - The Great Giana Sisters Fixed for 060/PPC

                       AMIGA EXECUTIVE UPDATE: MARCH 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

March 10, 2000

Dear Friends:

With all of the continuing rumors out there, one would think that we were gone,
or just spending the money that we raised on homes in Hawaii, or doing nothing.

I can assure you that this is not the case. As mentioned in the previous update,
if you do not read it here do not believe it.

This months letter is going to be a long one, and I apologize in advance for the
length. There is a lot of information here so take your time.

Recently I received an e-mail message that brought to my attention a sad
reality.

When Gateway purchased Amiga in 1997 they made many promises, and in fact there
were 6 different product announcements during their tenure. I was involved with
two of them, QNX, and Linux.

While I believed that we were going to deliver on the two product versions that
I was involved in, they did not materialize, and it has hurt many of you. The
decisions to change or alter either of these announcements was not mine, but I
was a part of the team that was involved in both. For this I am very sorry.

It is because of the reasons mentioned above that I promised not to say anything
or announce anything until it was done, and ready.

I know that this is difficult, especially with the number of great people and
Amiga companies who are feeling the continued strain, but I did not want to have
us all go through any more false starts, and undelivered dreams.

April 1, 2000 is the date, and St. Louis is the place. This is the first
opportunity for "your" Amiga company to present, demonstrate, speak, and see the
first product to come out of Amiga - The new Developer System. In fact one lucky
show attendee will win one of these systems.

With all of the above said; Another month, and a great deal of work has been
completed. Many of you believe nothing is happening, I can assure you that a
great deal has been occurring.

Amiga - "So the World May Know".

There have been some great new hires, many new partnerships and great progress
as we are moving forward. There is more information about them mentioned below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Partnerships

   - Tao-Group

     The first of course was the announcement with Tao-Group which has been
     moving along great. In St. Louis we will be showing the first round of the
     Amiga/Tao system. There is a great deal of work to be done, but we are far
     enough along to launch the new developer system for Tao at the show.

   - Haage & Partner

     We have entered into a long term relationship with H&P that will provide
     API's and a path towards to the future OS. This includes new updated
     versions of Storm IDE. They have also committed to porting all of their
     software to the new platform.

     We are also excited to work with H&P on a new version of the WarpOS that
     will allow the new Amiga to run on PPC accelerator cards. This means that
     an Amiga that has a PPC card running WarpOS will be able to run the new
     Amiga on that card! That's right. The new Amiga running on the current
     A1200s!

     More on H&P will become public as we continue to move forward and work
     through the testing programs.

     We are very excited about this relationship.

   - Hyperion

     Hyperion and Amiga have entered into an agreement for the porting of the
     existing and new games to the new Amiga. This along with the great work
     that Ben and his team have done in working on a new 3D gaming engine for
     the new Amiga. They have been working very closely with the Amiga
     development team and Tao-Group to make the development of games for the
     Amiga a cut above the rest. We are very pleased to be have them as members
     of the new team.

   - Epic Marketing

     Thomas Steiding has been a great supporter from the beginning. Epic has
     announced that not only will they be making their games available on the
     new system, but that they have secured the rights for many new games. More
     on Epic with a follow on announcement later.

There are many more partnerships that will be revealed in St. Louis with even
more exciting news.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E-Mails

Where to start. I continue to receive hundreds of e-mails everyday, and while I
am not the only one on the team who seems to be living on e-mail, we have not
been able to answer as many as we would like.

We are listening, and working on many of your comments. Here are some of your
concerns and what we have been doing to help:

   - Phase 5 and their recent changes.

     We have been in contact with Mr. Thomas Dellert, and Mr. Stefan Domeyer,
     and we are working with both DCE, and Met@box to provide solutions for the
     Amiga market and we expect some great news soon. I can say that the
     conversations have been going very well, and we look forward to working
     towards an exciting future with both of these companies.

     One of the key benefits with the relationships that we have been able to
     strike with both of these firms is their long term commitment to Amiga.

     According to our initial conversations, and project plans we are working to
     ensure that the new Amiga will run on both of the PPC boards supplied by
     these companies.

     We will be providing more detail in product announcements from both firms.

   - Dealer and distributors have been contacting us about their current
     situations and future plans.

     In response to the many requests we have created the Amiga Dealer Network,
     or "A D N". Randy Hughes our VP of Sales (more about him later) sent out
     an e-mail message to over 300 dealers, and the response has been
     fantastic. Many dealers are ready to begin carrying the Amiga again, and
     more are very excited about the future. The A D N is a way for us to
     better communicate our plans, hear concerns, and work together to create a
     stronger Amiga. As I am sure that you will see there are great things to
     come from the A D N.

     Remember that we plan on being able to run the New OS on PPC boards. Does
     your machine support that option?

   - Developers and the future development plans.

     Training sessions at Tao-Group have been continuing for some months now,
     and we have a better relationship today than when we started, and we are
     more convinced than ever that our decision was the right one. There will
     be opportunity in St. Louis for others to see the Tao-System at work, and
     we look forward to seeing all of you there.

     We also will be having a developer meeting in St. Louis on March 31st at
     7:00pm. This is a developer only meeting, and we will be giving
     information about the hardware, software tools, and the developer support
     program. We know that there is going to great interest in this seminar to
     plan ahead and get there early as space is limited.

     Please check the St. Louis show site, and the Amiga sites for more
     information.

   - Communication with the Amiga Community.

     We have contracted with Equinox Design to create the new "Amiga World"
     newsletter. This will be available for free to all of the Amiga community.
     Initially this will be made available via the Internet from our new website
     and then (if demand merits) we will make a printed version. This is not in
     anyway in competition with the existing Amiga publications that currently
     are in print. This instead is targeted as a newsletter designed as a
     vehicle to help the community communicate better together. The Editor of
     Amiga World is Fletcher Haug, the former Editor and Publisher of the Amiga
     Informer. The first edition should be available within the first two weeks
     of April.

     There are no advertisements, and we are using this as another method to get
     information out to all of you, and to help the publications that we have
     today.

   - More Communications with the Amiga Community.

     As mentioned in the past update, I have reactivated the AAC. There have
     been some great discussions and great ideas to come out of the
     conversations to date, and they will be a great help in the future as we
     move forward. The members of the AAC are:

Christoph Dietz  Carsten Schroeder Coner Kerr     Andrew Elia
Bill Panagouleas Craig Delahoy     Ben Vost       Wayne Hunt
Don Hicks        Goetz Ohnesorge   Gary Peake     Kermit Woodall
Holger Kruse     Thomas Frieden    Juergen Haage  Thomas Raukamp
Heinz Wrobel     Wayne Martin      Thomas Svenson Jeffery Rose
Randhir Jesrani  Trish Zlotek      Tom Lively     Cade Hannan
Luca Danelon     Guenter Horbach   Ian Greenaway  David Law
Paul Lesurf      Bill McEwen       Christian Kemp Basil Flinter

     We will soon be reactivating their aac.amiga.com mail accounts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Faces for the Team

There are many new people at Amiga, and we are excited about the team that we
are continuing to build. Below you will find some specific detail on certain
team members, here you will find the names and descriptions of the folks that I
get to work the most closely with.

   - Randall P. Hughes - VP Sales and Strategic Business Development

     Randy comes to us after being the VP of Sales at a very exciting Java
     technologies company ThinWeb. Randy and I worked together when he was my
     primary contact at QNX. He is a very skilled person with backgrounds in
     Banking, and technology. Randy understands the Amiga, and what the future
     brings. He has had business dealings with some of the strongest technology
     companies in the world. He was the person that QNX selected to open their
     first office in California. I know that you will enjoy meeting him in St.
     Louis.

     Now the official comments that will be going up on the web site later;

     Mr Hughes comes to Amiga directly from a Java based start up where he
     headed the sales and alliances function from inception to its filing for
     IPO on the NASDAQ exchange.

     Randy was initiated to the Amiga community as the lead manager responsible
     for the relationship with Amiga during his tenure at QNX where he headed
     the expansion to Silicon Valley and into Southern California.

     Randy was first and foremost a financier from his days at notable Canadian
     financial institutions, namely the Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank.

     Randy was educated at the University of Ottawa, Canada and at Marlborough
     College in England.

   - Vincent P. Pfeifer - VP of Operations

     Vince and I worked together for several years at ConnectSoft. Vince has an
     incredible ability to deliver products. I have seen him time and again
     walk into extremely difficult situations with very hard headed engineers
     and stupid marketing people, and deliver amazing products. I am very
     pleased that he has agreed to join us.

     Here is his official web site description;

     Vince Pfeifer has 14 years experience in the computer industry with the
     last 12 spent in the software area. Vince joins us from GraphOn
     Corporation where, as Vice President of Product Development and General
     Manager of GraphOn's Seattle based operations, he oversaw all Engineering
     resources for GraphOn's multiple development sites. During his tenure at
     GraphOn, sales tripled while product offerings doubled. Additionally,
     Vince helped oversee the merger that made GraphOn a publicly traded
     company whose Market Capitalization quadrupled in under a year.

     Vince has hands-on experience building and managing software development
     operations as well as product management organizations. Vince has
     experience with both startup organizations (ConnectSoft, Exodus
     Technologies, GraphOn) as well as more established companies (Symantec).

     Why I joined Amiga, by Vincent P. Pfeifer

     Other than the belief that Bill McEwen could sell ice cubes to Eskimos, I
     joined Amiga to take on the challenge of turning a company's name and
     image that has become somewhat dated here in the United States into a top
     level, respected company in the computer industry. As I am coming off a
     successful venture in helping turn GraphOn into a publicly traded company
     with record revenues from the position of Vice President of Product
     Development, I was ready for a new set of responsibilities in more areas
     than Product Management and Engineering.

     Amiga offers a challenge that I look forward to: build a company from the
     bottom up with the benefit of having name recognition and some technology
     already in place.

     It is an opportunity to do something that I have wanted to do since my
     early days at 5th Generation when I sat on the Tech Support phones and
     listened to average users try to use relatively complicated software. I
     know that it sounds like a religious crusade, but I want to make computers
     easier for the masses, and with my position at Amiga, I have an opportunity
     to help influence that vision significantly.

   - Gary Peake - Director of Developer Relations and Support

     My favorite man from Texas. Gary has already put thousands of hours of his
     life to support the Amiga, and the community worldwide. Now he has joined
     our team in delivering his years of experience and affection for the Amiga
     in supporting the efforts of the Amiga community.

   - Tarah Mallo - Reception and Office

     Tarah is our first line of communication to the outside world. She has been
     working with the development team gathering information and support. As
     well as helping me to get organized. I will state for the record that the
     pictures of the original office were taken "before" she joined. Say hello
     to Tarah the next time you call.

   - Kari Erickson - Executive Administration

     Kari is the person who will keep my life and travel plans in order. She is
     who you will get to speak to first before getting me, or any other member
     of the executive team. Kari joins us after leaving one of the very
     prestigious law firms here in the Seattle area, and I am sure that you can
     already feel her pain in having to deal with me on a day to day basis.

   - Susan Sutton - Director of Finance and Human Resources

     Susan is going to take over the collection of funds, and the paying of
     bills. She is also the person who gets to deal with all of the employee
     complaints about Fleecy. Just kidding there are more complaints about me,
     than there are Fleecy.

   - Gordon Stone - Director of Information Services and Information
     Technologies

     We refer to Gordon as the network man. Gordon got his start in computing by
     upgrading Amiga memory for recording studios in Oregon. He has since moved
     onto operating numerous systems, and is versed in all that is
     connectivity. Gordon actually will start in two weeks, but we wanted to
     introduce him now.

   - Operations in Germany - New Members on our team

      - Markus Grohmann - Order processing and EDP

        Markus already has a family history with Amiga, as his brother used to
        work with us in Braunschweig. We look forward to working with Markus.

      - Barbara Nitzsche - Executive Assistant to Petro

        With the addition of Barbara to our team in Germany we will be able to
        have Petro out more. Next time you call Langen say hello to Barbara and
        welcome her to Amiga.

   - Members of the Development Team

      - Dean Brown - Dean founded DKB weeks after the first A1000 came out and
        then spent the next 15 years designing and producing all manner of add
        ons, expansion cards and accelerators for the whole range of Amiga
        computers. He brings a deep understanding of the spirit and reality of
        the Amiga hardware, along with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of
        current and future projects. He will use this to help Amiga and its
        partners create multiple hardware platforms for the future.

      - Dave Taylor - Dave is another scouser, from Liverpool, UK, although he
        supports the wrong football team. He has spent the last ten years
        designing and implementing distributed manufacturing, control, and
        eCommerce systems for small, medium, and large companies across the
        globe, on Mainframe, Unix and Windows architectures. The last 3 years
        have seen him concentrating on distributed systems, databases, and n
        tier commercial systems. He brings commercial world experience,
        eCommerce expertise and formal methods with a refreshing new look on
        architecture to the company, and was also brave enough to try
        snowboarding with Wouter and myself.

      - Wouter van Oortmerssen - Wouter is a tall, dutch, quake master currently
        completing his doctorate at Southampton University. He has been an
        Amigan since the early 1990's and is most well known for the excellent
        Amiga E language and compiler that grew from a research project into a
        professional system. He is bringing a fresh look at language,
        conversation and interaction in the new Amiverse.

      - Andreas Kleinert - Andreas has worked for the last few years producing
        public domain, shareware, and commercial applications for the Amiga, PC
        and UNIX markets. For the Amiga market, Andreas concentrated on various
        graphics and datatype systems before taking up the challenge of lead
        developer for the SuperBase database product line. His deep knowledge
        of data storage, retrieval and indexing is core to creating a self
        describing and multi dimensional amiverse.

      - Trond Werner Hansen - Some people are leg men, others are face men.
        Trond is most definitely a face man - INTERFACE man 8-) Over the last
        seven years he has moved from small programs to enhance workbench,
        through completely reimplementing layers.library as SuperLayers, to
        developing a NG Amiga workbench system. With configurability and
        simplicity being central features for the Amiverse, Trond will be
        helping to redefine presentation and participation in digital worlds.

   - The Amiga Developer Support Network Crew!

      - Gary Peake <gpeake@amiga.com>

        Gary has used and beta tested on most Commodore/Amiga computers from the
        Vic-20 to the A3000. His organizational, design, and testing skills will
        be a valuable asset to providing a unique, forward looking online
        developer support system that will set many "firsts" in the computer
        industry. And his association with Team Amiga will enable Amiga Inc. to
        provide a valuable multi-national scope to Amiga Developer Support. Gary
        has many years of experience with online web applications and will
        utilize his experience to provide an evolving Developer Support
        structure that will grow with us and our Amiga developers. Gary is also
        a current member of the 3D Development Team.

        Gary will host our first Amiga DevCon in St Louis on Friday March 31st
        and will be there to answer questions on an individual basis through
        April 2nd. The full program details will not be announced until then,
        but all developers wishing more information should contact Gary Peake
        at <gpeake@amiga.com>.

        For information on the time and place of the DevCon contact Bob Sharpe
        at bscharp@icon-stl.net

      - Ray A. Akey <rakey@amiga.com>

        Ray is the creator of CNet BBS for the Amiga Classic and has been
        programming for the Amiga for a number of years. Ray's understanding of
        all areas of product development from concept to coding to testing to
        finished product gives us a unique look at all areas of Amiga Developer
        Support needs. Ray's experience with Internet application programming
        will prove extremely helpful for the future of the Amiga. Ray will also
        be assisting in maintaining some of the online systems we will employ.
        Ray currently lives in Canada.

      - G'o'tza Ohnesorge <gotz@amiga.com>

        G'o'tz is one of the most aware Amigan's I know in dealing with cutting
        edge products and issues. He has been an Amiga user since they were
        first available. G'o'tz is a quick study on high-end multimedia and new
        technologies. His expertise in getting the facts quickly and succinctly
        will aid us in all areas of developer support. He will be assisting in
        keeping information current and available for new developers in the
        several online systems we will be providing. G'o'tz's knowledge of
        several languages will help the new Amiga Developer Support System to
        be truly multi-national. He is a current member of the Amiga 3D
        Development Team, as well. G'o'tz currently lives in Germany.

        also currently a member of the Amiga 3D Development Team. Jonas
        currently lives in Sweden.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More information.

We have spending a great deal of time on infrastructure and getting ready for
the next wave.

   - New Building!

     One of the first problems was in the area of Real Estate, we currently are
     in 600 feet with us bulging out the walls, and being located outside of a
     car wash has its benefits, but it is still rather annoying with all of the
     car stereos going at the same time outside your front door.

     We are in the process of moving to our new world headquarters in
     Snoqualmie, Washington. The new address will be;

     Amiga Incorporated
     34935 SE Douglas Street
     Suite 210
     Snoqualmie, WA 98065
     USA

     Telephone number +001 425.396.5660
     Facsimile number +001 425.396.6551

     We officially open the doors and are up and running on March 15th, 2000.
     However we will begin moving equipment, phones, servers, etc on Monday
     March 13th, 2000. This means that it may be more difficult to get in touch
     with over the next few days. We apologize in advance for any hardship this
     may cause.

   - New Web Site!

     This is one of the number one items on the list, and the largest number of
     "comments" that we receive from the community.

     We have been in process building a new web site for some weeks. The
     difficulty has been server location and time. We have now addressed both
     of these issues and we plan to have a new site up in the next couple of
     weeks.

     A web site is a constant work in progress, so we look forward to your
     comments, and will continue to try and enhance the experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final thoughts.

This letter does not cover all of the activities that are and continue to take
place. There is so much more happening that I could spend days writing and still
not keep up with it all.

We are extremely busy here, and could not be having more fun. The company and
the people who have contacted us to support what we are doing have been in many
cases overwhelming. We have several more partnerships that we are going to be
announcing in St. Louis, and we hope to see as many of you there as possible.

I recently asked a long time Amigan, and a member of the select team that worked
with Jay directly the reason that Jay started this venture. I have heard many
ideas as to what Jay "really" wanted to do, and many e-mails inform me that they
know what Jay had planned all along. While I never had the chance of either
meeting, or speaking with Jay I thought I would ask.

Simply stated "Jay wanted to build the greatest home computing experience ever,
for under 500.00". I can tell you that his dream still lives with every member
of this company, and we will deliver on his dream.

I thank each and every one of you for your continued support, and look forward
to the future.

Keeping the faith,

Bill McEwen, and the rest of the Amiga team

                         FLEECY MOSS IRC CONFERENCE LOG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This stuff was logged by Harry "Piru" Sintonen. Unofficial joins, parts and
other irrelevant stuff grepped out. Amiga2K home page is at
http://www.amiga-stl.com/show.html. Complaints to: piru@innocent.com.

   - <fleecy> All of the announcements are going to be made tonight at the
     banquet, and then they will go up on the website. This includes a demo of
     the Tao stuff and the devbox. Tomorrow, the devbox and demos will be down
     on the floor just next to UGN booth so they can tell you all about it. The
     public website will go up in the next couple of days...so they tell me
     www.amiga.com.
   - <rudge> So the developer's machine isn't even out on display?
   - <fleecy> It will be out tomorrow - we are polishing the case at the moment
   - <Zonkk> Is everything chugging along nicely and meeting with your plans so
     far? And everyone involved happy
   - <fleecy> We are literally snowed under with offers of partnerships, money,
     fame, fast cars etc
   - <Gooseman> When are the parnerships going to be announced?
   - <fleecy> Before I tell you what the dev box is, you need to understand that
     the only thing that matters is the Virtual Processor(VP). It already runs
     on x86, PPC, MIPS, ARM, SH4..and some other very nice, soon to be
     announced megaCHIPS. What I pushed in my 3 hr Fidel Castro dev speech was
     that hardware is becoming a commodity. The dev machine will be a k6 2
     500mhz, 64MB, Geforce 256 machine - cheap, runs the Tao system very well
   - <dmac> will developer software be available on the web ?
   - <fleecy> Gary is doing the support site - there will be a full,
     professional organisation, paid and free, all done via the web
   - <Omni> So the dev machine is normal PC ?
   - <rudge> So can this system be put on any store-bought PC yet or is there
     still some hardware involved?
   - <fleecy> Not at the moment - as it is dev system we are only supporting one
     gfx card, 1 audio card etc.
   - <m0ns00n> Question: How about AROS. Are you supporting the initiative? Will
     AmigaNG OS be open source or free, like BeOS5?
   - <fleecy> We will be making an AROS announcement tnonight 8-)
   - <KatseNova> q: Do you plan to sell devkits, or will that available for
     free? By Devkit.. i mean only the software part.
   - <fleecy> We haven't decided yet - piracy is still a major concern
   - <jobe> what's with my pc having these specified hardware. am i able to get
     the dev soft?
   - <fleecy> Not initially, but quite soon afterwards. If the machine isn't
     bought from us however, then we won't support any issues you have
   - <Riley> is the new OS running native or hosted on the devbox? how about the
     first consumer releases?
   - <fleecy> It runs hosted on Linux to start with, to show that we can, and to
     make big companies realise we can do pure, very fast stuff or good hosted
     stuff - try before you buy gives our developers a huge market from the
     getgo
   - <Omni> Ok the dev machine is a PC with developer software, but no DOS no
     Win crap, right ? Will it look like another computer ?
   - <fleecy> It is a dev box, pig ugly and functional - no MS stuff near it
     though
   - <DJNick> Will there be some larger companies supporting Amiga in future,
     like Corel or Adobe...?
   - <fleecy> Tonight we will make announcements about partnerships with multi
     billion dollar companies
   - <jobe> how does the vp compare to java - in terms of performance
   - <dmac> Is uae or other emulation in current development ?
   - <fleecy> Not by us - but we are talking to 2 or 3 companies or groups who
     have different approaches
   - <dmac> How much is the dev machine ?
   - <fleecy> I just build them...
   - <Riley> can you shed any light as to whether there's any plans anywhere to
     bring out Amiga-branded hardware or at least machines with the new OS
     preinstalled sometime this year (ever)? so that people can go out and "buy
     an Amiga"
   - <fleecy> We will work with hardware partners, both Amiga and other to
     create a solution. How the marketing and branding is done is Bill, Randy
     and Petro's job. We hope to have a consumer system out before the end of
     the year....but the devbox will rusumer release, so although we call it a
     dev box, non devs can buy it
   - <portnoy> If it runs on a standard pc platform, will it take advantage of
     pc "plug&pray"?
   - <Gooseman> When will a high profile awareness campaign begin?
   - <fleecy> We have hired Frank Sinatra to run the campaign...
   - <KatseNova> q: Will you have a degree of support.. like your major support
     for devkits sells to commercial developers and hobbyists are last-inline?
   - <fleecy> We will support all levels = obviously we hope the community will
     come together around the free stuff as we have to concentrate resources on
     the paying customer s- this is a business after all ;-)
   - <m0ns00n> When will we see some good screenshots of the new interface (GUI)
     - will it feel like AmigaOS?
   - <fleecy> The interface system is abstracted - it provides an architecture
     on which multiple interface models can be added. Our first one will be
     something very different, but ppl can create anything they like
   - <Gooseman> What about going IPO?
   - <Riley> exactly what parts of the new OS are done by the Amiga team and
     what parts by Tao?
   - <fleecy> Tao is providing the core but that will be hidden beneath a
     radical new architecture
   - <???> when will we be able to buy a dev system?
   - <fleecy> We have 10 pre prods now - the master is being burnt and then we
     hope in 2-4 weeks, they will be in channels
   - <Gooseman> How big will the core OS be?
   - <fleecy> When we find enough punch cards, we'll let you know the core
     kernel is 25kb - the whole thing with the interface and JAva runs in 3MB.
     We think so, because we're talking about something more than just
     computers, or applications. Wouter (the gnarly snowboarder) will be doing
     something very special...and it's to do with farm animals
   - <Omni> Does the dev machine will provide access to USB, DVD, Firewire...
   - <fleecy> It is being added - that is the point of us releasing a dev
     system. We have 2 markets, the digital adventurer - an extension of the
     current Amiga market, and then the Domestic Digital Habitat, for those who
     hate computers but love devices
   - <DJNick> I'd like to suggest you to get in touch with more Amiga developers
     (like SoftLogik - PageStream, Greg Perry - DOpus, then programmer of
     Photogenics etc etc...). We need stronger ties between Amiga and its
     developers
   - <fleecy> there's an idea
   - <pepto> Will Icons be seperate files as in AmigaOS-Classic?
   - <fleecy> graphics are graphics, icons or animated baywatch images
   - <portnoy> You said earlier "We hope to have a consumer system out before
     the end of the year" WIll this be a really usable computer or something of
     an introductory level?
   - <fleecy> if it isn't then we aren't really doing our job
   - <OSS542> can you tell us something about this Virtual Processor and compare
     it with say, Transmeta ?
   - <fleecy> The VP is an abstraction - code is compiled to it and distributed.
     At run time, the "tool" is loaded and translated on the fly to native code.
     No, I don't know what you're doubts are.
   - <KatseNova> Who exactly do you consider to be targeted as developers for
     Domestic Digital Devices, will that be Big Names? To who do you plan to
     license the Amiga technology (if it is licensed)?
   - <fleecy> Anyone with a good idea and some money
   - <dmac> will it have ram: device like an amiga?
   - <fleecy> We tired putting a ram in it but it started eating the keyboard.
     The reason ppl are running to Tao is because of Java. The reason ppl will
     run to us is because we offer, smaller , faster, better
   - <Riley> how "Amiga-like" is the new system? are there any concrete
     similarities (like a screens-feature)?
   - <fleecy> I don't want to get into the religious war - we hired notably
     Amigans because the spirit is in them. Screens is just a mechanism in a
     single interface implementation
   - <Mr_Tickle> whats happening with Gateways AmigaObjects? do they enter into
     the question?
   - <fleecy> No
   - <Omni> Will the dev machine have video facilities to be widely use in the
     video market like the Amiga once did, and still does ... ?
   - <fleecy> You create your own structure, which is the way it should be
   - <KatseNova> As I understand that the Java VM is the core of the new Amiga,
     that means that apps are multiplatform .. windoze, Apple..?
   - <fleecy> No it isn't. Java is a service - the core is Elate
   - <Steini> is the new OS a single or multi user system, and how do you plan
     to support connectivity with other os's (network file systems and such) ?
   - <fleecy> yes - standard, open interfaces

@node not09 "PAYBACK STATUS REPORT: PART IX"
                         PAYBACK STATUS REPORT: PART IX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23 March 2000 - The Latest News

I regretfully announce that Payback has been delayed again - it will now not be
available until late May at the earliest. This is partly due to continued delays
getting hold of a graphics card and partly due to the sheer size and complexity
of the levels. Despite this, a lot of new features have been added this month:

   - Hidden mission have been added. I don't want to give too much away, but I'm
     sure you'll enjoy discovering them!
   - Lots of new graphics for the levels have been drawn.
   - The scripting language has been expanded to include lots of new 'triggers',
     which will allow more varied missions.
   - A lot more of the city has been designed.
   - New 'secret' vehicles have been added.
   - Lots of bugs have been fixed.
   - The collision detection system has been made a lot more reliable.
   - Textures are now compressed so that they use half the memory they used to.
   - An options screen has been added.
   - More sound effects have been added. For example, you can now hear bullets
     ricocheting off the walls, or crashing noises as you plough into a tree.
     The sound of your footsteps changes as you walk over different surfaces.

Well, that's it for this time - look forward to seeing you next update!

@node not10 "AROS LATEST STATUS"
                               AROS LATEST STATUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla <digulla@hepe.com>.

More than two weeks since the last update. No, we're not dead :-) Work is still
progressing; for example there is now a port of DOpus 4 (see our screenshots
page at http://www.aros.org/screenshots/). Many things still don't work but it
has been ported in just a couple of hours of work (mostly disabling things in
DOpus that AROS doesn't support, yet). Promising, I'd say.

But the more important news is that we finally got the attention of Amiga
(mostly because of the efforts of Steve Crietzman of OAF and Gary Peake of
Amiga; thanks a lot guys). I'd like to say that's good news but that's not
completely clear, yet. The point is that Amiga would like to help us but their
lawyers object :-) Welcome to the wonderful world of business. Currently, we're
trying to find a way thought his legal mess which a) doesn't hurt Amie, b) gives
AROS room to breathe, c) makes Amigas lawyers happy and d) helps the community.
c) seems to be the most problematic point here but we're working on it. Some
very interesting ideas have been proposed and now we and Amiga are checking what
can be done and what is futile. At this time, just a big thank at Amiga for
their openmindedness and the time they spent on this during the last three weeks
when they were also really busy with preparing everything for the Amiga 2K show.
Just in case you wonder why nothing was announced after fleecys' comment in the
IRC conference: The lawyers covered Bill with Red Tape when they wanted to do
the announcement. So you have to take my word for it :-) Hopefully, you can read
something in the Executive Summary, soon. No promises, though; this is really
ugly and every lawyer asked until now strongly suggested to proceed with extreme
care. Oh well...

Something on the more positive front, whatever happenes, the AROS sources will
stay available at least under MPL. Also, 4 people already applied for working on
AROS. Unfortunately, only one of them can move to Switzerland and that
especially unfortunate as my boss has come up with some plans to get this thing
going. So please, if you can imagine working on this full time, send your
curriculum, etc. to yourievsky@sowatec.com. As a teaser: You will earn at least
Sfr 72.000/year (that's about 45.000 Euros) because otherwise, the Swiss
Foreignpolice will not allow you to move to Switzerland (basically, the idea is
that if we don't need highly trained specialists for that job, we should be able
to find someone native for that; good for you in this case). Additional bonus:
If this project fails, we can easily find something else for you to do. So no
matter what happens, you can rely on having a job :-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: <info@clickboom.com>

Hi from clickBOOM,

We have more news about Nightlong for you.

Nightlong is approaching the final stage of development. It took a little bit
longer than was planned because we had to wait for a new version of Storm for
PPC. But, that should now be behind us, as Storm arrived.

We'll let you know as soon as Nightlong is ready.

On the not so good side, we only have 150 Nightlong PPC preorders currently.
Don't worry, we won't abandon PPC because of that, but you will probably agree
with us that 150 does seem like an awfully small number. :( We will have more
about that in our next issue of "S-files" soon.

At the Portal we have a new Nightlong trailer. This one shows a bit more of what
Joshua (the main character) can do. There are smaller (8Mb) and larger (22Mb)
versions. If you don't have a fast Internet connection, you can get the trailer
from your favorite Amiga magazine next mont.

Best regards,
clickBOOM

                AMIGA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH COREL A GREAT SUCCESS!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Immediate Release

Snoqualmie, WA, April 1, 2000 - Amiga Incorporated, is pleased to announce that
its new multi-media consumer interface is well supported by Corel LINUX OS and
other Corel applications including the newly released WordPerfect Office 2000
for Linux.

Amiga's multi-media consumer interface runs extremely smooth and fast on Corel
LINUX OS, and the compatibility between these great products has provided Linux
developers with a new and exciting way to create incredible multi-media titles,
and games for Linux.

"Amiga pioneered the creation of multi-media, and easy to use graphical
interfaces 20 years ago, and today begins the path of the reintroduction of a
legend. The New Amiga is the creation and embrace of leading technologies and
combining them with the 20 years of experience in multi-media development
environments," said Bill McEwen, president and chief executive officer of Amiga.
"Corel has leading products within their categories, and we are excited about
their supporting Amiga towards the future."

"Linux developers now have choices when it comes to leading edge applications,"
added McEwen.

"Corel is dedicating extensive resources to develop Linux, and receiving such a
positive endorsement based on Amiga's experience with our products is
tremendous," said Dr. Michael Cowpland, president and chief executive officer of
Corel Corporation. "Corel takes pride in producing quality products, and we are
thrilled to provide our Corel LINUX OS to Amiga's world-class systems. We look
forward to working with Amiga as they continue developing products and
technology for current and future computing devices which are focused on making
computers and the Internet a natural part of everyday life."

Corel and Amiga first announced they were working closely to support the new
Amiga Operating Environment in July 1999. The two companies formed a new
relationship to ensure that Corel's award-winning software applications were
supported on Amiga's new line of products. Corel and Amiga continue to discuss
possible future alliances.

There will be full support for the existing install base of Amiga users, and
more announcements will be forthcoming about the current Amiga and the next
generation of those machines.

@node not15 "AMIGA SHOW ANALYSIS BY CORINNA COHN"
                      AMIGA SHOW ANALYSIS BY CORINNA COHN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This report has been written by Corinna Cohn (lazuli42@yahoo.com).

Hello,

I spent Saturday, April 1st and Sundary, April 2nd in St. Louis as the Amiga 2k
show. Following are some of the rumours, some of the news, and some of my
impressions.

                                   The Crowd:

As usual for the St. Louis show, on the morning of the first day the line of
visitors extended from the entry doors back to the lobby of the hotel. Nearly
everyone, visitor and vendor alike, was wearing some sort of Amiga pagentry.

There was a carefully optimistic attitude amongst the attendees. Naturally,
everyone is impatient and wants to have a new Amiga in their hands, but with so
many false starts in the past it seems that the idea is to hope for the best but
expect the worst. What are Amiga's plans? I'll explain below.

This is the fourth year of the St. Louis show, and I've attended them all. The
faces in the crowds are nearly all familiar to me. Attendence has slowly
declined over those years, but I think this is because there is no new system to
purchase. Also, the turnout of developers, while not necessarily decreasing, is
certainly not increasing and there isn't much new to see.

I heard other people remark that they saw some new faces. Hopefully, if more
good news keeps coming from Amiga then we'll see new crowds at the show next
year.

                                  The Vendors:

The old World of Amiga shows used to inspire vendors to the heights of
decorative creativity as they competed for the attention and cash of show goers.
Nowaday it's rare to find a festively designed booth, but some vendors still try
to dress up a little bit. Whereas the old big shows were semi-formals, this show
was casual.

My favourite part of the shows has always been the developers' displays. It's
fun to see the latest and greatest release of my preferred programs, or to see
what new applications are out. With the slowdown of the marketplace, there was
little new to see. Here's is a list of products that left an impression on me:

   - Hyperion had a number of games on display including Heretic II, Wipeout
     2097, and Shogo. All of the games were running on a 233Mhz PPC. Heretic II
     looked choppy and pixelated, and Shogo was only available as a demo, but
     Wipeout 2097 looked very smooth. The Amiga version was absolutely better
     than the Playstation version--it looked as good as any current PC game.

   - Weemsware was demonstrating a program which animated a mouth on a cartoon
     figure which used the Amiga translator.device for cues on which shape the
     mouth should be in. The end result is that the figure had appropriate
     mouth movements for the words that it was pronouncing. The program also
     included some other clever features such as being able to easily lip-synch
     with a sound file.

   - Paul Nolan was demonstrating Photogenics 4 on a Linux laptop. For anyone
     familiar with The Gimp, let me say that Photogenics makes that program
     look like an amateurish college project. Photogenics is fast and polished
     with a consistant interface. The GUI is built from a toolkit of Paul's own
     design, and while sometimes a little counter-intuitive (for instance, the
     tabbed panes are vertical instead of horizontal and automatically switch
     when the mouse moves over them), is cetainly much better than the one used
     for The Gimp. I was curious as to why Paul was using a PC instead of an
     Amiga for his demonstration. Apparently his Amiga was damaged right before
     the show, but he assured me that the two programs were nearly identical.
     For those Linux geeks, keep an eye out on the toolkit, which might be
     released as Open Source in the future.

   - Nova Design has a new product called Millennium which is a collection of
     third party tools, utilities, graphics, and plug-ins for the Videto
     Toaster and the Flyer. Nova Design did not have this collection available
     for demonstration because of the absence of a Toaster. Kermit Woodall
     mentioned that sales have been good for the product.

   - SoftLogik showed up after a two year hiatus with their new Pagestream 4.0.
     The demonstration machine didn't seem to have a graphics card which is too
     bad because this is a program that needs to be run in high-res (1024x768)
     mode to take full advantage of it. I spoke to Daren, the demonstrator, and
     asked about the stability of the different versions. The MacOS and Amiga
     versions are quite stable, but the Windows version continues to have a
     printing bug that they are busily trying to repair.

Although there were other developers, unfortunately I didn't take the time to
see what their products did. No slight is intended against these fine folks who
are supporting the market with their blood, sweat and tears.

Oh, finally I guess I should mention that Anti-Gravity was showing the BoXeR
there in an acrylic case. The motherboard is ATX form factor. Two things struck
me about the design: There are 3 DIMM slots, but only two are for RAM expansion.
The last is intended to be the connector for a PPC card. The other thing that
struck me was that stereo out ports were positioned in a spot that you'd have to
knock out of an ATX case, and that there were no joystick ports. The
Anti-Gravity representitive suggested using a USB joystick, but I wonder if this
would work with older games? A manufacturing plant in California has been
selected for the production of this board, and they expect to be shipping in
about two months.

                                  The Banquet:

I hate mushrooms. Actually, I also hate banquet dining. I even hate the way
banquet is spelled. The only banquet that I ever really enjoyed was the first
one at the Sacramento show which was served buffet style.

Anyway, after dinner, and after our crunchy ice-cream was served (yech), Bill
McEwen got up to present his demonstration. Bill faced the crowd wielding a
six-pack of Diet Coke and a slick Scala slideshow. After presenting Bob Scharp
and his wife Dianna personallized Amiga bomber jackets for all of their hard
work on the show, and after inviting the crowd to take a commemerative Amiga
tee-shirt, Bill got down to the nitty-gritty.

The first part of the presentation was a history of the new Amiga. Bill spoke
about being fired from Amiga (which is not quite true since he was a contractor,
not an employee), and went on to show that living well is the best revenge. Some
pictures of the new Amiga offices and the view from said offices brought home
the point that Amiga has money, and moreever, intends to make money.

The presentation continued with a recap of what they've done in their first
three months of work. I noted the strong similarities of Bill's speech and the
one given by Jim Callos last year at the same event. Sometimes, Bill even used
the exact same phrases. More on this in a bit. Amiga's partnership with Tao
seems to be the most important part of Amiga's new strategy. Tao is serving a
similar purpose that QNX was originally going to by providing the underpinnings
for the Amiga interface.

Bill continued on, talking about the importance of strategic partnerships, and
dropped such names as Sony, JVC, and Motorolla. What is the relationship between
these companies and Amiga? Well, apparently these companies are trying to come
together to make a standard for a consumer-device operating system, and Amiga
hopes to bridge the gaps between these different companies goals. Here is my
understanding: The Amiga environment (or OE, operating environment per Jim
Collas) will sit on top of Taos' virtual machine, which can sit on top of
another operating system, such as Linux. This means that no matter the operating
system, Amiga+Tao can be the interface for both the user and applications. Will
this work? Who knows? But I'm interested in seeing what happens.

Mr. McEwen also talked about how Amiga is receiving support from two different
Linux companies, Red Hat and Corel. Bill talked about how these companies are
excited to be working with Amiga, but the slides he showed which quoted both Bob
Young and Michael Cowpland seemed to indicate only that the companies were happy
to hear that Amiga wanted to work with them.

After this segment, Bill smeared the work Gateway-Amiga did on case designs
(rumour has it they payed 1.6 MILLION dollars on case design), and then bragged
that he had some designs by Disney animators. He then went on to show about a
dozen slides showing concept towers, desktops, game consoles, and servers. Some
people may have enjoyed these concepts, but my opionion is that only people who
are qualified and experienced in consumer product design should attempt such
work. The designs were either ugly, impractacle, impossible, or all three.
Perhaps Bill will put some pictures on the Amiga web page so that you all can
draw your own conclusions.

There was a brief demonstration of the Tao technology. The Tao was running as a
virtual OS on top of Linux. The Tao window looked exactly like something from
AmigaOS 3.1, but this is fairly easy to do with any system. They demonstrated
the speed of the Tao Java Virtual Machine by opening several applets at the same
time. I'd like to point out that when you load an applet locally, it will run
faster than one that is downloaded because Java doesn't have to make as many
security checks. They had an updated version of the Boing demo, with the
enhancement of being able to actually pick up the ball with the pointer and
throw it around the screen to have it bounce off of things. Other applets
included video filters that could be placed over other windows to do things such
as increase the brightness, apply a sepia tone, or display the window with false
colour.

The presentation concluded after Bill presented the rest of the Amiga team with
similar jackets that the Scharps received earlier in the evening.

                  My Impressions of the Banquet Presentation:

All in all, I was dissatisfied with the presentation. The first segment seemed
to be a combination of Mr. McEwen rubbing Gateway's nose into the dirt, and Mr.
McEwen talking about what an amazing guy Fleecy Moss is (my opinions of Fleecy
are well known, but I'll have more on that anon). I think that this part of the
presentation could have been done without very easily. All it did was negatively
impact my opinion of Bill McEwen's professionalism.

The partnerships that Mr. McEwen got so excited about worked out like this:
Amiga is a partner with Tao, Tao is a partner with some other companies, those
companies have a partnership with JVC, Sony, etc... Aparently this may have been
enough for Amiga to get meetings with those companies, but this seems a lot like
a friend of a friend of a friend relationship. I thought Bill misrepresented the
relationship between the Linux companies and Amiga. Does Red Hat and Corel want
to work with Amiga? Or are they just happy that Amiga wants to work with them? I
asked Bill McEwen to clarify this later in the evening, which I'll elaborate on
below.

The case designs that Bill presented were gruesome. One after the other, it was
like having to see slides of acid burn victims. The tower case looked like it
was reflected in a fun-house mirror. The game consoles looked like bubbling
plastic blisters, or like camping lanterns, depending on the design. The servers
looked like toilets with exhaust pipes. I don't know why Bill was so proud of
these designs. There are better concepts on Aminet for new Amigas. Hell, the
vacuum-look-alike that Escom designed looked better. The A600 looked better.

I left the presentation quite pissed off.

                           My Talk With Bill McEwen:

Later on in the evening I was able to confront Mr. McEwen about his
presentation. He was open and interested in my opinions, and I'm grateful for
the opportunity of being able to share them with him. I listed several of the
issues I had, and he responded.

In the first case, I told him that I thought his speech sounded too much like
Jim Collas' from last year, and that aside from the Tao demonstration, it was
mostly fluff. Bill said that sounded right, considering that he wrote Jim's
speech from last year. I tried to point out that it was irrelevant that he wrote
it because the end effect was him sounding like he was recycling Jim's platform.
Well... actually they are recycling Amiga's former plans, but with some small
differences.

Secondly, I told him I was concerned that Amiga's level of professionalism was
not high enough to inspire confidence. This mostly goes back to my problems with
Fleecy as a leader (such as joking about bestiality during an interview), and
Bill's continual thumb-nosing at Gateway. I feel like I'd be betraying a
confidence to mention too much here, but I'll say that he addressed my concern
and I'm looking forward to seeing an improvement from Amiga in the future.

Third, I brought of the case designs that he showed off, and in response he told
me that Amiga, outside of the developer box and the perhaps the first consumer
machine, had no plans of selling their own hardware. It was confusing why he
would even show off designs then if they didn't intend on entering those markets
with their own products. I told him that he left the impression that they were
going to make those products, and he said that he would try to clarify better
what Amiga's plans are concerning hardware.

Finally, I brought up my problems with his mentioning the Linux companies as
partners. I asked why Red Hat or Corel would abandon KDE or Gnome in favour of
the Amiga system and he explained that Amiga was only going to use the Linux
kernal. It wouldn't make sense to team up with the two players if they were just
using the Linux kernal, so I think two things might be going on here: 1) Amiga
is trying to gain attention by playing off the Linux name. 2) Red Hat and Corel
might try to enter the consumer device market with the Amiga interface.

                         My Interview With Fleecy Moss:

Would you believe how that no fewer than three people who read my initial
criticism of Fleecy on the MooBunny actually approached me at the show to thank
me for it? "Arexx" Aaron Ruscetta convinced me that I should at least be more
open minded towards Fleecy's ideas, so I decided to actually talk to Fleecy.

Fleecy, although very busy Sunday morning, was kind enough to lend me some time.
To avoid being bothered, we snuck back to the pool and grabbed a table with only
two chairs. I explained that I'd been quite critical of him, and that in the
interest of fairness I'd like to get his perspectives. Unfortunately I had no
method of recording the conversation so there won't be any quotes, but I will
paraphrase.

I opened with my charge that he hadn't enough experience to be doing the work he
was. I asked him to explain how any of the jobs he'd worked on before related to
what his responsibilities were now. He told me that he'd consulted as a project
manager on a number of big business projects. He described some of the systems
that they were working on, what the end goal was, and how they achieved the
goals. Fleecy has been accused of being a jargon-slinger in the past, and I can
verify that it's true, but he knows what it all means even if he uses it too
much.

I remain unconvinced that the projects that he worked on before really prepared
him for what he's doing now, but I now have a better idea of what he's
accomplished in the past. I'd guess that there are 20,000 people in the US right
now that have the same sort of experience. Few of those people are actually
working on operating systems or operating environments, because those kinds of
projects take expertise of the sort that I think Fleecy lacks. We will see what
becomes of his projects. It seems that the partnership with Tao is positive. In
fact, everything we've seen so far are Tao's ideas, not Fleecy's. I'm interested
to see what kind of impact his additions will make.

I brought up the point that all of the community groups that he'd either started
or been a leader in had fallen into shambles. He talked about the politics
behind JMS, the goals of OASYS, and what went wrong with KOSH. He also talked
about his relationships with various people at Amiga. On the later, he actually
went on for quite a while, and from his perspective there is enmity between he
and Alan Havemose, Jeff Schindler and Steve Jones. From the sounds of things,
Fleecy hadn't a good relationship with anyone there except for Bill McEwen,
which explains their current partnership.

Fleecy doesn't have everything it takes to be the leader some people want to be,
and he seems to recognize that. He said he was sorry for all of the cutting
public remarks he'd made about his previous employers, and he was sorry for
launching his attacks from Kosh, which wasn't supposed to have been related. He
said that he'd bothered that so many people seem to blindly follow him. He said
he appreciates constructive criticism.

My opinion of Fleecy has changed a little bit. I no longer think of him as being
out increase his own fame at the expense of the Amiga, but I do think of him as
being a little short-sighted. I still think his ideas are a little strange,
although I no longer rank him with Tim Rue. His concepts are too abstract to try
to go from concept to commercial without plenty of research, but I think he
deserves a chance to do the research. If Fleecy were happy with just doing R&D
for Amiga, I'd be satisfied. If he got out of the spotlight, I'd stop
complaining. If he stops modelling himself as a community leader, I'll no longer
throw stones.

There are two ways people relate to Fleecy. Either they adore him and consider
him to be a visionary, or they oppose him and consider him a faker. How many
ways do people relate to Randall somethingorother, some guy who's one of the big
three Amiga executives but whose last name I can't remember? If Fleecy weren't
jumping out in front of the camera all the time, there'd be no debate about him.

                             Corinna's Rumour Mill:

   - From a room party with some game developers: Some of Amiga's funding is
     coming from Jim Collas.

     I personally disbelieve this rumour. I asked what Fleecy thought of Jim
     Collas, and while he didn't seem to have the same kind of vitriol for him
     as for other former Amiga personel, he wasn't overly enthusiastic.

   - Overheard near Anti-Gravity booth: Anti-Gravity is very pissed off with
     Mick Tinker and they're at the breaking point. They want their BoXeR board
     completed. They've had to go to a number of new investors to keep the
     project going. They're concerned that nobody will buy one without an AGP
     slot.

     I'd say there's a reasonable chance that this is true. I saw Joe Torre
     pointing them to an article in a computer magazine comparing the
     performance of PCI to AGP (for those that are curious, AGP usually doesn't
     make a sizable difference).

   - Overheard after banquet: Fleecy Moss and Bill McEwen have been butting
     heads on issues concerning the direction of Amiga.

     Who knows? In my talk with Bill McEwen he emphasized that he is the leader
     of the company, and he doesn't mind upsetting other people to get things
     done the way he wants them.

   - Overheard Sunday morning: A conglomerate of Japanese and European
     businesses are financing Amiga.

     Yeah, and Microsoft is going to buy out Amiga. They money they have is
     coming from somewhere, but I doubt Amiga even shows up as a blip on
     anyones radar.

That's it folks. I hope you appreciate my news and views.

                   BILL MCEWEN ON AMIGA'S WEBSITES AND DOMAIN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As many people are aware we are having problems with the web site. This is in no
way a reflection of how we do business.

This is a reflection of the inherent problems of business relationships.

When Amino purchased all of the domains from Gateway for Amiga there was more
than one party involved in hosting Amiga web sites.

We have been working for months in getting everything transferred to our servers
and our ownership.

Now many of the people who were at Gateway/Amiga are no longer there, and we
still are having problems with their releasing the domains to us. This has
become very clear with our new web site, and the fact that thousands of mail
messages are not arriving.

We are working as quickly as possible on these issues, and hope to have all of
this resolved today. However there are some people (companies) who are making
this very difficult as they do not want to let go of our accounts. I am
purposely not mentioning their companies here in this message, but will make it
known if it becomes necessary.

I thank everyone for their patience as we more than frustrated at the lack of
professionalism in working with these companies, as we take control of our web
sites, and mail.

                          HERETIC II: PROGRESS REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12-March-2000: Final progress update by Hans-Joerg Frieden

CURRENT STATUS OF THE HERETIC II PROJECT

We are currently putting finishing touches to the port, and if everything goes
OK, Heretic II should be available by the end of this month, or beginning of
April latest. We expect to go "gold" this week.

Note by the webmaster: Heretic 2 has not yet been released at the time of
writing, contrary to announcements on some websites!

   - Installer

     The installer has been written, the only problem right now is space
     considerations, since we intend to put the in-game video sequences onto
     the CD uncompressed (they take up about 100 Megabytes, and play reasonably
     fast even from a 4X CD-Rom drive). The installer, as well as the icons,
     take advantage of OS 3.5 if present.

   - In-game bugs

     The last remaining bugs are currently being ironed out. Most where caused
     by the rather complicated save/load process, which was very difficult to
     re-model. One of the team already finished the game now (the only good
     point about debugging - you get to play your game too :-)

     The game can now be played in just 64 Megabytes (which we consider a good
     improvement from the original 100 Megabytes footprint). The hardware
     renderer requires a bit more memory, but can be played with slightly
     reduced texture size. The visual quality loss is virtually undiscernable.

   - The Heretic Fortress

     The freeware addon "The Heretic Fortress" by Wankeroo has been brought up
     to comply with version 4.0 of the Windows original. The work has been
     exclusively done by Steffen Häuser (in his spare time!), and he did an
     excellent job too... Currently it is being updated to 4.5.

   - What is left...

     Currently, we're working on finishing the CD. There are quite a lot of
     things which have to be taken care of, like proper documentation,
     mastering of the CD, and other such things. The amount of work involved
     has also delayed our OpenSource release of the MiniGL library, which
     should have been out already (and will be shortly, promise!).

     We're just now in Quality Assurance at Activision, and after that at
     Ravensoft. They received a test machine from us for this purpose, and
     we're sure they won't take too much longer for this.

   - Preordering still available

     You can still pre-order Heretic II from Titan Computer
     (http://www.titancomputer.de/ami/order/index.html) for a limited time now
     at DEM 89. Don't miss this opportunity!

     We have decided to make Heretic II Amiga a two-CD set. But we won't tell
     you what is on the second CD...

   - Hyperion at St. Louis

     If you are going to the St. Louis show, make sure to stop at our booth and
     see Heretic II demo'ed extensively there!

                 OPEN FOUNDATION PROGRESS UPDATE FOR MARCH 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Open Amiga Foundation

  Progress Report for March 7th, 2000 by Open Amiga President Steve Crietzman

                          Introduction to this report

It has been some time since our last update to the Amiga community, several
weeks in fact. In this time there has been a huge amount of progress and
activity behind the scenes which has gone unreported.

We must apologise for the long delay between the last progress report on this
one. However, there are good reasons for this.

Please allow us to explain.

It is the policy of the Open Amiga Foundation not to make announcements
prematurely - before we know we can deliver on them - and so we have been
reluctant to discuss what had been happening behind closed doors. Many of our
projects - our negotiations - were at early stages of development, and we were
unsure whether we were able to gain the necessary commitment from various
companies we were negotiating with. It was therefore felt necessary to leave the
negotiations unreported, until a more definite resolution was on the horizon.

However, we felt too long had gone by without an update, and since we are now
fairly optimistic of a satisfactory outcome, we are departing with our usual
policy to give people an idea of what is going on. It must be stressed, however,
that nothing discussed in this progress report is fixed in stone.

The reason this information is being shared early with the community is in the
interests of openess and transparency. The Open Amiga Foundation seeks to be as
open and accessible as possible, and to sync ourselves as closely with Amiga
community opinion as possible.

Our regular reports are created to keep the community up to date on our
progress, and to encourage maximum feedback and paticipation by interested
members of the Amiga community.

So, without further ado, here's what's new since our last progress update.

           Amiga application authors releasing source code under GPL

In the last several weeks, several Amiga applications developers have taken the
plunge and released their applications under liberal open source licenses, such
as the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License.

We want to thank the Amiga developers who have taken this bold step.

We especially want to thank Greg Perry and Jonathan Potter of GPSoft, for
releasing the source code to Directory Opus, Douglas McLaughlin for the release
of the strICQ source code under the GPL license, and Manuel Lemos of the BGUI
Development Team for their committment to migrate their development to an
open-source strategy in the near future.

The release of such a rich variety of source code is extremely helpful to those
of us working on creating a free, portable software AmigaOS solution. All code
released under the GPL becomes immediately available to us to utilise directly
within the Open Source AmigaOS project, currently under way at Open Amiga/AROS.

If any developers of Amiga system-level software, such as filing systems, are
reading this progress update, we would request you contribute to the free,
portable AmigaOS project by releasing your source code under the GNU General
Public License, or a similar license. OAF/AROS's AmigaOS project in particular
needs a portable, free filing system. It would help if a developer of a filing
system would release their code under GPL; this would save us valuable time,
effort and energy that could better be spent developing other parts of the OS.
It saves us duplicating work already done by someone else.

             Discussions with Gateway over access to Amiga patents

Critical to creating a convincing copy of the Amiga operating system is access
to the Amiga-related software patents currently held by Gateway. These are
arguably the most important piece of the puzzle, since they are required to
create a convincing AmigaOS clone - many of these patents govern the appearance,
functionality and internal workings of the operating system - such as the famous
"right-mouse button menu" patent.

In recognition of the significant importance of these patents to our cousin
open-source project AROS, the Open Amiga Foundation have been in discussions
with Gateway's attorneys for the past several weeks, and we now believe we are
close to an acceptable working agreement for access to these patents.

If we are successful, we will be able to implement the unique Amiga user
interface design into the open-source AmigaOS/AROS project. AROS will be able to
look, feel, and operate in every important way identically to the existing Amiga
operating system, without violating anyone's patents, trademarks or copyrights.

We will have Gateway's permission to use the patents, we will not utilise any
copyrighted AmigaOS source code as part of the AROS project, and we are hopeful
of reaching agreement with Amiga for the rights to use trademarked Amiga names
within the AROS project.

However, if push comes to shove, we can always relabel parts of the OS that use
trademarked terms, and develop measures to convert existing code to use the new
terms.

              Cooperation with Amiga International and Amiga, Inc.

The Open Amiga Foundation maintains an open line of communication with Mr. Petro
Tyschtschenko of Amiga International. We frequently discuss matters of mutual
interest and concern, and Mr. Tyschtschenko, as an open supporter of our
project, has frequently offered both public and private support for our
activities. We cannot thank Mr. Tyschtschenko enough for his kind support and
encouragement over the past several weeks and months, and we value our continued
discussions and cooperation with Mr. Tyschtschenko greatly. We look forward to
continuing to work with Mr. Tyschtschenko and his team in the future.

Our relationship with Amiga Incorporated in the United States is a little
different, as we are still, I believe, in the process of learning about each
other's projects and plans, and since our discussions with Amiga in the United
States is still in a preliminary stage, it is hard to comment on precisely how
our relationship with Amiga Incorporated will evolve. Nonetheless, we look
forward to building up a more solid working relationship sometime in the future,
when Amiga has more time to work with us on this matter.

Amiga Incorporated have, however, stated their public support for the activities
of the Open Amiga Foundation and AROS, and for that we thank them. We also
appreciated the opportunity to meet with Mr. McEwen and Mr. Moss in Reading,
England earlier this year. It was nice to have an opportunity to meet them and
hear their plans and ideas for the future.

It is our sincerest of desires to work closely and in close cooperation with
Amiga Incorporated on our open source projects.

However, as is clear to anyone who has observed Amiga in recent months, their
primary focus is centered on the development of their symbiotic relationship
with Tao Group, and in producing products and strategies that revolve around
that partnership.

In acknowledgement of Amiga's desire to focus attention in their own
Tao-oriented directions right now, Open Amiga have developed alternative,
contingency plans in order to operate and function without the need for such
close co-operation with Amiga Incorporated. This has the advantage of our being
able to operate independently and without concerning Amiga with a stream of
requests and questions, but has the disadvantage that we are not able to
fine-tune our projects and our plans in sync with those of Amiga, or to plan in
co-operation with Amiga Incorporated, but these issues can always be addressed
at a later time.

In short, we intend to keep up the momentum we have built up, and to continue to
aggressively pursue and implement our own product plans and strategies to create
a successful, free, portable Amiga operating system clone which is hardware
agnostic and will function on under a variety of CPUs and operating
environments.

In this context, support and mutual co-operation with Amiga is seen as a
desirable element that could be of benefit to both groups, but in no way a
necessity. With access to Gateway's Amiga patents, we are able to operate
independently and pursue our strategies. When Amiga's time frees up a little, we
look forward to further discussing our plans with them and to working together
with them. In the meantime, we proceed with developing our products and plans
independently of Amiga.

           The Free Software Foundation and the Open Amiga Foundation

As an organisation that marries the interests of the free-software and Amiga
communities, the Open Amiga Foundation is in contact with Richard Stallman of
the Free Software Foundation, to explore options to address issues of mutual
concern and interest.

Discussions with Mr. Stallman are still at an early stage and it is too early to
comment on what may come of this, but we are hopeful that we will be able to
reach a level of understanding and of co-operation that will benefit both the
Free Software and Amiga communities, and bring mutual benefits to both the GNU
and AROS development projects.

Open Amiga is committed to seeking alliances and strategic relationships with
organisations (whether for-profit or nonprofit) that share a common interest in
the direction we are pursueing and the activities we are undertaking, from the
Amiga, Open Source, Free Software and general, mainstream business world, trying
our best to bring the Amiga into the mainstream of modern computing, without
losing our unique identity in the process.

We encourage people who work for Amiga or Free Software organisations and
businesses with an interest in our activities, or who may have business
proposals for us, to contact us. We are interested in seeking alliances with
organisations wherever this is mutual gain in doing so.

Open Amiga and AROS remain committed to a future where the AmigaOS will remain
an independent and sovereign operating system, available for a wide variety of
software and hardware platforms, operating environments and CPUs, with all the
functionality, appearance, power and flexibility of the original AmigaOS - with
added new, modern features being implemented in the process.

                             Work Continues on AROS

The AROS project, which is at the heart of it all, continues to gain momentum
and support from more Amiga developers, but we still need your help. If you are
a developer and you support our work, what are you waiting for? E-mail Aaron
Digulla and ask to be added to the AROS Developers list, the heat of the action
for development on the AmigaOS/AROS project.

Open Amiga is working on a progress report section on our website to track the
latest developments of the AROS project. It should be going online the same time
as the rest of the website.

                Open Amiga Foundation About To Spread It's Wings

The Open Amiga Foundation came one step closer today to being a legally
registered entity. In order words, the Open Amiga Foundation will soon be born -
officially.

We today proudly posted the result of several weeks of work, in the form of
several sheets of legalese - our completed Memorandum and Articles of
Association, Form 10, Form 12, and Form 30(5)c to Companies House.

This is part of the formal process of turning Open Amiga into a legally
registered nonprofit limited company. This status will be useful in our
negotiations with other companies, and offers certain advantages that will be
helpful in carrying on business. Companies will also have a clear contact for
any commercial matters they may wish to discuss.

We will also be able to ask for and receive gifts and donations. Companies and
individuals who support our work and would like to see AROS developed quicker
will be able to donate money or hardware to the project to speed things along.
There are also a variety of cost-free things people will be able to do to help
us in our projects. More information on this will be available on our website,
when it goes online, when we're registered :)

Once we receive our Certificate of Incorporation, the new Open Amiga Foundation
website will go online, and this will be the official birth of the Open Amiga
Foundation. Then the real fun begins! (As well as plenty more hard work!)

                           Your Feedback and Comments

Again, your comments and feedback are central to our work. We strive to be the
best embodiment of the ideas, inspirations and collective creative talent of the
Amiga community that we possibly can. Open Amiga and AROS would not exist
without the hard work and dedication of a great number of grassroots Amiga users
and developers, and it's thanks to all of the dedicated hard work and talent of
people like you, that this project has been possible, and there is plenty more
to come.

In order to better serve the Amiga community, we need your comments, thoughts,
suggestions and feedback. Please use the contact information below to share your
thoughts with us. We'd love to hear from you.

You can e-mail us at president@amigakernel.org, use ICQ number 21722511 to send
us an online message (checked daily), or phone our company headquarters on +44
(0)1778 393323 between 9am and 9pm GMT to speak directly with our president,
Steve Crietzman. (Unlike many groups, we actually encourage direct communication
wherever possible, so please do not hestitate to call or ICQ.)

Thank you again for your continued interest and support of the Open Amiga
Foundation / AROS. We appreciate your kind e-mails of support, please keep them
coming! :)

We'll continue to do our part, in doing deals and forming relationships, and
continuing to develop great, free software for the good of the Amiga community!

AmigaOS still has plenty of life and potential left in it. With your help, we
can really help push back the boundaries and have it fight it's corner and
establish a niche in the mainstream of modern computing.

Best regards,

Steve Crietzman
President and CEO
Open Amiga Foundation

             HYPERION SIGNS SIN FROM ACTIVISION FOR AMIGA AND LINUX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperion, the Amiga's premier entertainment software company, has acquired a
license from Activision Inc. (NASDAQ: AVTI) to port Ritual's critically
acclaimed ego-shooter "SiN" to the Amiga and Linux platforms. SiN is based on ID
Software's spectacular Quake 2 engine using OpenGL.

"We are in the process of finalising our Amiga port of Activision's Heretic 2",
says Ben Hermans, Hyperion's managing partner. SiN, like Heretic 2, is based on
ID's Quake 2 engine, so we are confident we can complete the Amiga and Linux
versions by the end of Q2 2000. SiN is synonymous with first rate, unadulterated
action with relatively low system requirements so Amiga and Linux users have
something to look forward to."

The Amiga version will require a PPC (supported through WarpOS) and will support
3D accelerators through Warp3D and Hyperion's custom OpenGL implementation
(MiniGL).

Both x86 and PPC Linux versions are planned with an Alpha version under
consideration.

                            [TWF] APRIL 2000 UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Ed Collins <collins-e@dnet.co.uk>

  1. Website Update

     We have unvealed our newlook TWF and Explorer 2260 websites in March with a
     couple of nice pictures suitable for your workbench backdrop. The E2260
     section has been brought fully uptodate so you know what to expect from
     the game. Hope you like the new look. The M&M site should have a new look
     by the end of first week in April.

  2. TWF Opinion Polls

     The current poll we've been running asked the question:

     With quite a number of ports of popular PC games currently being ported to
     the Amiga platform, what would be your prefered option for TWF to do ?

     Just two choices this time, Game Ports or Originals.

     The current scores are:
      - Game Ports 44
      - Original Games 136

     So a resounding vote in favour of original games development. We have no
     plans at present to port other games anyway, we were just curious to know
     what people think on the subject. :)

     Another poll will be put on as soon as we can think of a new one.

  3. Explorer 2260 Update.

     News this month:
      - Investigated openGL and accelerated X systems for Linux, 2D graphics
        layer porting started.
      - Changed the internal representation of several NPC interactions.
      - Work on improving and clarifying screen/system connections started

     Next month I'll contact Hyperiod to enquire about miniGL usage and finish
     the texture file creator.

  4. Maim & Mangle Update.

     News this month:
      - A new internal release of the game engine within the next few days.
      - Updated engine now uses miniGL developed by Hyperion.
      - Work is continuing on adding the path finding to the game.
      - M&M gets a mention with a screenshot in the final issue of Amiga Format.

     And nathan has this to say.
      - Work is continuing on the user-interface with the intentions of getting
        something usable very shortly.
      - Disaster struck with nathan's amiga hardware disabling it for a couple
        of weeks. Now fixed and working well again. Did give some time to work
        on the linux version of the GUI.

  5. Next News Update

                                 VAPORWARE NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Oliver Wagner" <owagner@vapor.com>

   - http://faq.vapor.com now online

     We are now providing an automated FAQ system for all Vapor products at
     http://faq.vapor.com

     The content is a bit sparse at the moment, but new answers are added nearly
     every day. The ultimate goal is provide a useful source of information to
     all users of Vapor applications, and to take some of the load off the
     mailing lists.

     The FAQ database is organised into per-product categories, and also one
     general section -- all of which can be searched easily.

     As a bonus, FAQ-O-Matic, the software installed on http://faq.vapor.com,
     allows *everyone* to add new entries, after registering with a valid email
     address.

     The bug tracking main page (http://bugs.vapor.com) now provides simple
     statistics on pending and processed bug reports. Also, due to the recent
     moving of http://www.vapor.com's httpd to php4, the Keystone bug tracking
     system is now much faster.

     The upgrade to PHP4 caused some minor disruptions, but we now believe any
     such teething problems to be over.

   - New Online Registration System

     Due to ongoing stability issues with SecuraPay, we've found a different
     solution for the online registration system.

     Silicon Circus Ltd. (http://www.siliconcircus.com) is now an authorized
     Vapor distributor and accepts online registrations for most of the Vapor
     products in their online shop.

     The URL for the Vapor section of SC's shop is
     http://www.siliconcircus.com/shop/index.php?shop=VPR

     All links on http://www.vapor.com and http://v3.vapor.com to the online
     registration facility have been updated to point directly to SC's site.

     SC's shop offers online payment by all major credit cards by means of
     WorldPay (http://www.worldpay.com/). All transactions via WorldPay are
     securly encrypted using SSL, with full 128 bit encryption when using the
     Voyager 3 integrated SSL module. WorldPay does not use Microsoft
     technology.

     If you have any questions or comments about the online ordering system,
     please don't hesitate to contact <shop@vapor.com>

                           VOYAGER SSL 8.6 AVAILABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Oliver Wagner" <owagner@vapor.com>

[Please see http://v3.vapor.com/ for download links]

This is version 8.6 of the Voyager SSL module. It replaces the voyager_ssl.vlib
which ships with V³ 3.0 full or earlier. To install, simply copy the
voyager_ssl.vlib from the Plugins/ drawer into the Plugins/ drawer of your V³
install directory, or use the provided Installer script.

Major changes since the SSL module version included in the last public V3
archive (8.4):

   - no longer supports DH key exchange.

     Although this is generally a good thing, it was far too CPU extensive to
     properly work with slower CPUs, and sometimes caused problems in the
     application backends of SSL sites

   - set strong preferenc e on the RC4-MD5 cipher combinations during initial
     cipher selection exchange

     Although TripleDES-SHA is actually crytographically stronger than the
     RC4-MD5 cipher (3DES is 168 bit effective key length, vs. 128 bit for RC4
     or 40 bit for EXP-RC4), this also caused some confusion in banking sites,
     which, possibly due to lame coding, assumed that 168 bit key length is
     LESS than 128 bit...

     RC4-MD5 is generally the cipher negotiated when using one of the popular PC
     browsers, and thus has the largest chance of yielding the expected results.

   - improved efficiency of session cache.

     The session cache avoids renegotiation of the session key on subsequent
     connections to the same SSL server. This will improve the speed of
     fetching SSL pages with many images.

   - removed lots of (now) stale code

If you notice any nonworking SSL sites, please mail a bug report to
<voyager-bugs@vapor.com>, possibly giving the URL of the site in question, any
error message you received from the server and the version of V, the SSL module
and your TCP/IP stack.

Voyager SSL is based on OpenSSL 0.9.4. See http://www.openssl.org/ for more
information.

                             CMANAGER 1.8 RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Simone Tellini" <wiz@vapor.com>

Short: Contact Manager, a centralised system-wide address book

The Contact Manager is a system address book which allows you to store all your
favourite user information, web sites, ftp sites and IRC server/channels. It is
designed as a replacement to the never-ending number of bookmarks, address books
and similar GUI's that are built into the many different Amiga Internet and
communication programs.

It offers a number of features over a lot of the internal bookmark/addressbooks:

   - You can store a range of different information for one user. In the user
     section, for instance, you can include their address, email address, phone
     number, fax number, web site, ftp site and so on. All these options can be
     utilised by other software. Voyager can use the web information,
     Microdot-II can use the email address, STFax Pro can use the fax number
     and so on.

   - One GUI, many programs. You can store all the information you require
     within one interface. No need to worry about Microdot-II's addressbook,
     Voyager's bookmarks, STFax Pro's phonebook, AmFTP's server list etc.

   - Interacts with other software. Microdot-II, AmIRC, Voyager, AmFTP, STFax
     Pro, DOpus Magellan and IBrowse (all available separately) will all add
     information to the Contact Manager from within these programs. For
     example, find an email address when reading a mail within Microdot-II?
     Just click 'add to addressbook' and the email address will be added to the
     Contact Manager.

     Some of these programs will use the Contact Manager in additional ways. For
     instance Microdot will call the Contact Manager when you press to: or cc:
     when writing a new message.

     Textinput (the built in Vapor text editor that ships with Microdot-II,
     Voyager, AmIRC, STFax Pro amongst others) now supports the ability to
     insert Contact Manager information into any document. For instance, say
     you were writing a message with Microdot-II, you could insert a name,
     email address, phone number or any other Contact Manager field, directly
     into that document. You will never have to remember a friends email
     address ever again!

   - Groups and sub-groups. The Contact Manager allows you to create groups for
     different kinds of users/addresses. AmFTP, for instance, does not allow
     you to create groups or sub-groups within its server list, however this
     can be achieved via the Contact Manager.

   - Multi-user support. If you are using Genesis as your TCP/IP stack, the
     Contact Manager will support and allow multiple users within one
     interface. If there are more than one user in your house (family members),
     each user can have their own configurations (with password) so that their
     information remains private.

   - Plugin links. AmIRC (from v2.1) now ships with an internal Contact Manager
     plugin. This allows you to add users to the Contact Manager from within
     AmIRC (based on the current userlist), add interesting channels to your
     Contact Manager channel list and even search for entries within Contact
     Manager from within AmIRC.

For further information, please read the accompanying documentation. Contact
Manager is available from Vaporware, http://www.vapor.com.

Changes in this version: 1.8 18/02/00

   - Fixed Thor import, screwed in the previous version. Whoops.
   - Thor importer splits name/last name parts.
   - Fixed CM crash when quitting it while an edit window is open.
   - Added MUIM_CManager_Cleanup: application *MUST* call this method before
     disposing the application object.
   - MCC: now correctly checks for a newer database to load during MUIM_Setup.
     This has been broken in one of the previous releases, causing some
     out-of-synch troubles.

Bye

                             AMTELNET 2.3 RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Oliver Wagner" <owagner@vapor.com>

AmTelnet 2.3 released

How to obtain

   - amtelnet_23.lha (307249 Bytes)
   - amtelnet_23.lzx (264290 Bytes)

FTP:

   - ftp.vapor.com, /pub/amtelnet/
   - ftp.us.vapor.com, /pub/amtelnet/
   - ftp.ch.vapor.com, /pub/vapor/amtelnet/

WWW:

   - http://www.vapor.com/
   - http://vapor.meanmachine.ch/

(for other WWW/FTP mirrors, see http://www.vapor.com/download/)

E-MAIL:

   - Mail to <fileserv@vapor.com>, put "SEND AMTELNET" in the body.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Introduction

     AmTelnet II is a client for the Internet "Telnet" and "SSH" protocols for
     remotely logging into computers, playing text-oriented multi-user games
     ("MUD"s or "MUSH"s) or manually simulating internet protocols.

  2. Note for registered AmTelnet 1.x users

     AmTelnet II requires new keyfiles. However, the upgrade for registered
     AmTelnet 1.x users is *FREE*. New keyfiles have been mailed out to all
     existing AmTelnet 1.x users to the e-mail addresses on which they
     originally received their keyfiles.

     Should you, for some reason, not have received your AmTelnet II keyfile
     yet, please mail your current AmTelnet keyfile together with a short note
     on *WHERE* and *WHEN* you originally registered to
     <keyfile-update@vapor.com>. Please note that those requests have to be
     manually processed by a poor overworked software developer (me), and thus
     they generally have awkward response times -- sorry for that.

     Please note that NetConnect II users are not entitled for an free AmTelnet
     II upgrade. AmTelnet II is part of the general NetConnect III upgrade,
     however, please contact Active Technologies for any relevant information
     on the NetConnect package issues.

  3. Registration

     AmTelnet II will work in 15 minute demonstration mode without a keyfile.

     AmTelnet II can be registered with the included registration utility at any
     of the 7 registration sites worldwide, or directly online with any major
     credit card at

     http://www.vapor.com/order/

     Delivery of keyfile is instantious with the online registration system.

  4. Bug reporting

     Please mail bug reports and enhancement suggestions to
     <amtelnet-bugs@vapor.com>

     Any reportes submitted this way are automatically entered into the
     VaporWare bug tracking system. Please see

     http://bugs.vapor.com/

     on more information on how to access the bug tracking system.

  5. Documentation

     As the time of writing, AmTelnet II totally lacks any documentation. Any
     volunteers on that are greatly appreciated :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since last public release (2.2):

   - 2.2.1
      - Net: now sends linux-alike PTY modes when requesting a SSH link. Should

       FORMING A PROFESSIONAL/COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT TEAM TO WORK ON AROS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla

My boss, Mr. Yourievski from the Sowatec AG (http://www.sowatec.com/) has
offered us a once-in-a-lifetime chance: If enough people apply for working full
time (incl. getting payed real money :-) on AROS here in Switzerland, he will
have a really good look at this business opportunity. If he can see a way to
make money with it, he will handle everything necessary to get us going at full
steam :-)

So if you think you're worthy ;-) and you can move (or already life) in
Switzerland, send you resmuee to:

Sowatec AG
Witzbergstrasse 7
8330 Pfäffikon Switzerland

or by EMail to

yourievsky@sowatec.com

If you cannot move to Switzerland, then send your resmuee, anyway. Just note
that we need at least 5 developers here; when we reach that, then the rest can
probably live anywhere :-)

Also note that this would greatly enhance our relationship with Amiga Inc
(because then, they would have a professional partner instead of a bunch of
hobby developers working on their spare time).

Please bother him only if you're interested in working full time on AROS. All
other inquiries should go to me (digulla@sowatec.com) directly.

Thanks,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF THE POLLS

There is now a summary of votes (http://www.aros.org/votes.html) on our server
which I will update once per day. Please continue voting.

Since there seems to be a confusion how the polling works: My script looks for
the first questions and then searches for 21 single digits and counts them :-)
So you can insert your answer anywhere after the first question (no need to add
extra lines or whitespace); just don't add extra digits :-)

The BoXeR motherboard has been substantially updated over the last few months.
The developer, Mick Tinker, has read many emails and has been active in
conferences and there have been many comments and suggestions. Not being deaf or
blind to the changes in technology and component pricing since the BoXeR was
originally conceived it was decided that the original BoXeR design was out of
date before it was ready to ship, hence the BoXeR has been redesigned from
scratch.

                         Current status of development

Above is the first picture of the new prototype board. Final development/testing
stages are now underway in conjunction with developing additional logic to
support all the features and making sure everything works as intended.

We have had a meeting with Amiga Active magazine, and will announce further
stages as and when they are completed.

We are extremely pleased and excited with how the product is now developing.

                               Development notes

There is a dual USB interface, this is currently designed to evaluate the
implementation and we are making no commitment to ship in the final build,
however we would like to think that we are not wasting design time on something
that's not going to stick around! USB does require a fairly complex set of
drivers to support the basic operation as well as the wide range of devices that
could be connected. We have not initiated any software to cover this at this
time, it is more than likely that the specification of the interface will be
made freely available so that a keen developer can pick up the task. No
enquiries about the implementation and operation please until we have at least
had the chance to make sure the hardware is working and a development board is
available.

                               How does it work?

The SDRAM is 64-bits wide and has a direct connection to the PowerPC, this feeds
the ravenous demands of a high speed RISC processor. The PowerPC is able to
burst to and from the SDRAM, giving a substantial memory bandwidth.

The MC68040/060 has a relatively slow 32-bit data bus so a bridge is required.
When reading, the SDRAM supplies 64-bits of data, this is latched and held in
the bridge so that the SDRAM can be released or can start its next cycle. On any
given cycle the 680x0 will be reading the upper or lower half of the bus,
therefore that proportion is passed straight to the processor. If this is a
simple one cycle access the other half of the bus is held just in case the next
access is from the location that is already held - removing the need for a
further memory access. For a multi-cycle burst (a 16 byte cache line fill) as
soon as the first access to SDRAM is complete and latched in the bridge another
one is started, by the time the 2 halves of the bus have been read out of the
bridge the next 64-bits will have arrived from and are latch to start completing
the second half of the burst. Notice that in this operation the 680x0 is
carrying out a full or near full speed burst, while the SDRAM is carrying out 2
separate memory cycles. During a write the operation is similar, but in reverse.

The current logic is only connected to the 32-bit bus (a limitation on the
number of pins on the devices used for prototyping), however it is able to carry
out high speed data transfers so that true bust cycles can be used with the
SDRAM, effectively providing a double data rate 32-bit bus.

Hello and welcome to the 20th issue of AmiChannel News.

I know that this issue is a little bit late, but only a little little bit, eh!
The reason for this tiny delay has been the Amiga2k show held in San Louis on
April 1-2. I was expecting reports from the show and confirmations of the things
which came from there, but Amiga Inc is lacking of professionalism.

As probably you know by now, "Fool's Day" is a day devoted to say false things.
Taking into account that the news we hear from the very beginning came from only
one source, you can imagine that everybody thought that they could be false. And
no move in the Amiga website. Not even a proper press release. This is not the
prfessionalism you can expect from a today serious company.

But apart from that, there are a lot of news, all of them you can read in this
issue. The development box has been unveiled, although it is not ready for
release. As expected, the devbox is just a PC with AMD K6-2 500 Mhz, 64 Mb RAM
and GeForce 256. Not a problem for me. The Eleate OS will run hosted on a Red
Hat Linux system. As we are speaking of the devbox it is not a bad thing. The
problem is that the user system to be released who knows when wil run hosted on
a Linux system.

I'm sorry to say that this could be the end of the Amiga as an independent
system. Amiga will lost its identity. Instead of "trying to change the world",
Amiga Inc "embrace Linux" for its success. So, we are in the same position in
Collas times, but this time it has not been promised a hardware box. And we have
lost one year.

Remember to visit the SAUG website, which is located in:

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.
