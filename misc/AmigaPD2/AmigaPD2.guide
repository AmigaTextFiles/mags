 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

  Well yet another fun game to play on the workbench.  This game uses very
  simple graphics, cursor control and a pair of eyes to keep you entertained
  while you're letting the day slip by...  This game has lots of levels.  I
  solved the first three easily and kept moving on into the other levels
  slower and slower.  It supports the following catalogs:

                        English
                        Danish
                        Finnish
                        German
                        Norwegian
                        Polish

  The author is working on a level editor.  It keeps track of high scores,
  and it looks great on a high resolution Workbench.

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

  AmiTalk has come a long way...  This version is much better than previous
  versions because it works on my system.  I have talked to many people with
  previous versions that did not work properly.  This version works, and it
  works well.  I was able to "talk" with a friend who was using an older
  version of talk, then we tried it with WinTalk on his Pentium and again
  a success.  The cut and paste works well also.

  I rated the installation as Medium because although it has an installer
  script you have to go in and make some modifications if you already had
  talk installed.  For those of you installing talk from scratch then you
  should have no problems at all, for those of you updating versions there
  are some notes in the documentation that you will need to read so you
  know what files to change.

  Talk is a great way to check in with your friends across the net when they
  are not on the IRC, or you don't want to wait for them to answer your mail.

 DLD and the unpacker.library are supplied and the rest are easily obtainable.

 @{fg shine}Installation@{fg text}

 (X) Easy ( ) Medium ( ) Hard ( ) C= Installer

 @{fg shine}Documentation@{fg text}

 Very brief, but then it is only a 'front-end' requiring you to have lots
 of other utils to use.  This is understandable.  It does list what you
 will need for full use (see above), and most of these will come with their
 own docs.  One good point about the doc is that it contains a DOPUS setup
 which is useful and makes setting it up a doddle!

 @{fg shine}Known Bugs@{fg text}

 No bugs were recorded, but it does seem to have a nasty habit of crashing
 (well it doesn't cause the computer to rest, but locks up the window where
 it was started) if you try to unpack a file which has already been
 unpacked.

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

    Well, when I first got this util I was using an arexx script to do the
 job, and whilst I had built-in support for Lha, lzx, arc, zoo, etc, I didn't
 have the technical knowledge to do it for others.  So this was a bit of a
 lifesaver-- especially considering I run a BBS, and unpacking strange
 formats can be a right hassle!

    The first thing which made me fall in love
 was the DMS option.  It asks where you want it to be unpacked to, saving
 loading up loads of DMS-Win type proggies-- I found that useful.

    The proggy isn't very graphically nice.  It looks quite ugly greeting
 you with Lx v2.2 By DarkSpirit 1995 in inverse video, which is enough to
 put most people off, but the program does work well.  Slight grievances
 are that it doesn't have a list command, which I think would have been
 reasonably easy to implement in the first versions, although for the amount
 of formats supported now (it says it supports 152!) I can understand that
 this would be harder.  Another option I would like to see would be the
 ability to configure archiver strings in a separate file, for those who
 know how, to get better compression/less speed or vice versa.

    As mentioned above this program does have problems when a file already
 exists, but is well worth a look anyway-- especially for anyone who needs
 to unpack files or unknown packer automatically and for people who run
 BBSs/mail points/nodes.  Overall an excellent program, and any lack in a
 nice interface is made up for by working steadily and well :)

    Are there any graphic experts out there?  Well if you are an

 nice logo for this magazine (mainly just for web pages).

    What I'm looking for is a graphic about 400x200.  Of course,
 it doesn't have to be exact.  It needs to have the following
 "Your Guide to: The Best In Amiga PD", of course you may be as
 creative as you dare.

    All submissions will be considered, and the following issue will
 contain the chosen picture when distributed.  All runners up will be
 displayed on my Web page for viewing as well. You can send all entries

       @{fg shine}Public domain (PD), shareware, and freeware: Our definitions@{fg text}

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     Many people use the terms PD, shareware, and freeware loosely, but the
 editors of The Best of Amiga Public Domain want to clarify our usages.  In
 order to keep this from being a monsterous essay about rights, we will keep
 things simple and adopt a broader standard than others might use.

     The term "public domain" is derived from literary terminology meaning
 that nobody claims any rights to a said work.  Thus, it is in the "public's
 domain" and can be used by anyone for any purpose.  But we will modify that
 term to refer to any computer software that is publically accessable and
 distributable.  So, PD-- for us-- means any software you can legally copy
 and share.  In short, we will not refer to any software which is illegal to
 distribute.

     The term "shareware" means that the author of the software requests
 that you send some form of payment if you decide that you like the
 software.  Paying may incur upgrades and/or new features.  It may simply
 clear your conscience.  In some cases, registered software cannot be
 redistributed since it is only available directly from the author.  These
 circumstances should be clearly stated in the software in question.

     The term "freeware" means that the author expects no payment for usage
 of his or her software.  For brevity's sake, we'll leave it at that.

     Unless otherwise stated in the software, all rights to software is
 owned solely by its author.

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

    You begin your quest above ground on an island.  Although you can't
    explore very far on the island, it is a novel beginning.  Soon, you are
    underground...

    The game is completely mouse controllable (with keyboard support as
    well) and easy to navigate mechanically, because everything has a nice,
    big icon.  The logical screen is a little bigger than the
    standard NTSC physical screen, but you can move it around with the
    left-Amiga-mouse movements to adjust it.  This had no significant
    effect on playing.

    One distinguishing feature of this game is that it has various rooms
    that contain neat things like a chemistry table, a skeletal adventurer,
    and a mausoleum.  Plus, each room and hall has a one or two line
    description which adds to atmosphere.  Speaking of atmosphere, the game
    does have some sound, but no music.

    While the game is very good, I think it will frustrate a lot of people.
    The dungeon display doesn't neccessarily correspond to the heading of
    the player.  There is a compass onscreen which helps, but I found it
    rather confusing to move through the halls.  If you can get past this
    and map out the levels, I think you will find your time well spent.

    If you have decided to write a review, here are some tips for helping
 us keep edit-time to a minimum:

    Most importantly, structure your review into paragraphs.  Each
 paragraph, even if it's only one sentence, should deal with a single area
 of your topic.  For example, you don't want a paragraph that discusses
 aspects of interface and the sound effects both.  Break this into separate
 paragraphs, and it will make your review seem more "together" and
 professional.

    Remember 5th grade English and the Topic Sentence?  Each paragraph
 should begin with a broad topic sentence that gets explained in detail in
 the body of the paragraph.  Also, no sentence in a paragraph should give
 redundant or useless information.  Keep it lean.

    Separate paragraphs with a blank line.

    Try to watch spelling and punctuation, but don't worry about this as
 much as structure and content.

    Following these suggestions, along with the template, should provide us
 with a review that will require little in the way of editing, and we can
 get around to putting the magazine together faster.  Thanks for your
 interest and contributions!

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

    You may have heard of this game before, or even seen it in Amiga World.
    My expectations of it and what it actually is were very different.
    Contrary to popular opinion, it is not an Arctic Fox clone.  It is
    based on a similar premise, but Intrepid holds its own.

    Your mission is to rescue a beautiful female scientist from the
    clutches of an evil terrorist organization known anacronymatically as
    I-SOR (eye sore).  You are presented with many screens of information
    about your location and the surrounding terrain of the Antarctic
    tundra.  You travel around, expend fuel, expend bullets, and expire the
    enemy thugs who pop up in shooting gallery-style action sequences.

    The interface, like the entire game, is an extravagant illustration and
    completely mouse controllable.  Every click seems to emit an
    appropriate sound and graphic movement.  Very slick, very simple.  I
    didn't even read all of the provided online docs, which are presented
    with yet another nice point-and-click interface screen.

    The graphics are good; the sound is good; the gameplay is interesting.
    The only qualm I have is with the time limit.  It seems very short.
    Each move takes 5 minutes and you only have about four hours to find
    the scientist.  It may sound like a lot, but that tundra is big and you
    have to locate supplies as well as dispatch the enemies encountered and
    then still find the I-SOR headquarters.  That's a lot to do!

    But in the final analysis, Intrepid is a top-notch shareware offering.
    Get it, and (if Peter is still contactable) register it to lend your
    support.

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

    Have you ever played a game once and not stopped for several hours?
    Generally this happens with commercial software.  There are exceptions
    in PD: MechForce, Megaball...  and now Knights!

    The premise here is that you and a friend delve into a single-level
    dungeon trying to solve certain objectives.  It's the objectives and
    the "split-screen" that really make this game shine.

    Using joysticks (the easiest controls), you guide your intrepid
    warriors into the dungeon level that was randomly created.  Inside
    you'll find zombies and vampire bats to contend with (and they aren't
    dumb, either), as well as your worthy human opponent.  You'll find
    various potions, scrolls and weapons to play with.  The variety really
    keeps things new for a long, long time.

    Your objectives range from escaping from the dungeon while possessing a
    certain item (book, wand, etc), or after having used a certain item to
    open the exit door, or simply killing the other player.  There are
    several preset objectives, but you can change almost all aspects of
    them.  Options include number of keys in the dungeon, number of gems,
    population of zombies and bats, etc, etc.  Again, variety is the rule
    here.

    The dungeon is presented from a bird's eye view, straight down.  The
    graphics are very good, with lots of animation and special effects.
    The screen is divided into two sides, one for each player.  It is
    suggested that you use a book or cardboard to block one another's view.
    I agree.  The game wouldn't be nearly as much fun if you could see what
    strange noise your opponent just invoked.  And, boy, are the noises in
    Knights strange!  The sounds are great, especially when you splat a bat
    with a hammer....

    My brother and I played this until 4 in the morning the evening that I
    downloaded it.  My advice: get it, now.  The down side: if there's
    nobody to play with, you'll have much less fun.  While the game is
    still playable to some extent, the two-player element really brings it
    to life.  This game beats out anything I've reviewed so far.

    As noted in the docs, there are no plans to expand this wonderful game
    any further.  That really depresses me, because this is a first-class
    job, and it is brimming with potential for expansion.  Maybe if we all
    sent Kalle a little monetary incentive, there would be an update... :)
    When I spoke to him, though, he said that he was sick of AMOS and would
    probably never get back to it.  Bummer.

    When I first downloaded this I wasn't sure what to expect.  It is a very
    very small program.  It loads fast and asks you what you want to do. You
    can configure the size of the maze and then let the computer generate it.
    You then can take a "2-D" view of the maze from over head and that is all
    fine and dandy, but the thing that makes this program is when you go into
    the "3-D" mode of the maze.  This brings up a big window with you smack in
    the middle of the maze you just created and you have to find your way out.
    No, I didn't find any cheese, and let me tell you the first few times I
    played I could not get myself out of it.

    The graphics are *very* simple, but effective. The game moves along quickly
    without having to spend a lot of time updating the graphics. If you like a
    good challenge then get this program.  Let the computer create a really big
    maze and then spend the day tyring to find your way out.

    This is another great Workbench game.  It allows you to pass many hours
    away just hanging out while your computer is doing other more meaningful
    chores.  If you remember those little plastic boards with the sliding
    pieces inside that you had to move around until you had them in the right
    order or they made a picture, then you now know what this game is all
    about.

    Don't come here looking for graphics because there are none.  It is done
    simply with numbers.  But, it is very configurable.  You can tell it how
    many rows and columns that you want, tell it the size of the pieces that
    you want, and several other options.

    If you are collecting Workbench games then you should add this to your
    collection.  It is very good.  One things that I would like to see added to
    it is some sort of scoring system along with a high score table.  Even if
    it just kept a timer that would make it more of a challenge.

 @{fg shine}Documentation@{fg text}

    For those who only want to play it, the docs are good.  On the other
    hand, if you want to make your own levels, many things are left either
    ambiguous or not mentioned at all.  This is frustrating, because the
    editor is very powerful and flexible.

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

    As AMOS games go, I generally find them to be poorly designed.  After
    downloading this and seeing that it was written using AMOS, I sighed,
    "Oh, another lamer."  Boy, was I wrong.

    Let's start with gameplay.  You are in some magical "pits" from which
    you must escape.  The fiction of the game explains this part with a
    neat graphic intro, but the main point is that in order to move to the
    next level, you must place barrels over every blue square on the level.
    You can find a few types of crystals and other objects to aid or hinder
    you.  Learning how these elements interact is part of the challenge.
    On top of it, the configurations of barrels and boxes and other objects
    make for some incredibly entertaining (and brain bending) puzzles.

    As with many AMOS games, the graphics are excellent.  They resemble
    Ultima VII both in size and in perspective.  I was highly impressed.
    There is lots of animation, as well.  Water moves in waves, your man
    takes steps when he moves, bends and strains when he pushes a barrel.

    The game sports music, but it gets a bit repetitive.  The sound effects
    are sparse, but are well done.

    Using the mouse, you control the character.  You can simply click
    somewhere on the screen and he will attempt to go there.  It is this
    kind of detail that makes this game exceedingly good.

    This would all be enough, since there are more than thirty levels to
    traverse, each more devious than the last.  I didn't play very many
    of them, but what I played and what I saw are all exceptionally
    designed: difficult, yet balanced and solvable with experience.  But
    wait!  There's more...

    You have the option of creating your own levels or modifying the
    existing ones.  With the editor, you can do virtually anything
    conceivable within the game's rules.  There is even a scripting
    language that you can use to do intricate things like showing an
    external IFF file, or printing a text message.  It is especially useful
    in modifying the environment, like removing or adding objects, and so
    on.  Like the game, the editor is controlled entirely and elegantly
    with the mouse.

    Overall, I was shocked by the quality of this software.  It is
    commercial quality and Abe deserves to be paid for what he's done.
    There are a million Sokoban clones, but this one takes a step ahead and
    pushes the boundaries of the genre.  Excellent!

    by David Zvekic.

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

      This prgram is one essential program for anyone having to deal with
    AmigaGuide files.  Heddley makes the effort of putting together a
    guide file seem effortless.

      Heddley will use the advaced features of the latest AmigaGuide library.
    You can do such thinks as bold, italics, and underline.  Heddley also
    supports the reverse text, highlight, and fill types.  Creating buttons
    is a snap.  When you go to create a new button you are given options to
    do internal, and external document links, ARexx scripts and commands as
    well as DOS commands and a quit option.

      With the preferences you can chose your editor, text width, font and
    font size.  To make your life easier, you have several save options.
    You can save it not only in AmigaGuide, but ASCII, ANSI, and HTML.  While
    you are working on your guide file you may want to check and see how it
    is looking. Well, there is a "test database" option which loads up your
    document right there for you to check out.

      The interface, the ease of use... I would recommend this program to
    anyone in need of creating an AmigaGuide file.  Heddley is used in the
    making of this very magazine.  The author should be commend on his
    achievement on creating the best AmigaGuide editor to date.

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

    Well, if you like two-player games with fierce competition, here's
    another to put on your harddrive with Knights (see review in this
    issue).  The premise here is that two duelling spaceships compete in
    races and/or blow each other up a certain number of times.  While there
    is no scoring, per se, there are statistics to compare among players.

    One thing that I always like to see in games is configurability.
    Gravity Force 2 has oodles of options.  You can change anything from
    thrust power to gravity strength to type of weapons used.  I hear of a
    newer version which has even more options than this one, and this one
    has about six or seven screens of it.

    When you've set up your options, you have about 50 levels to play in.
    Some are races, the others are duels.  Races are fun, and they can be
    played solo, but the duels are the real point of the game.  With the
    many special weapons and the ability to knock your opponent into a wall
    and destroy him/her, you'll soon be addicted.

    If you want to have a long night of battling, you can have two or more
    players enter the Tournament mode.  While only two players compete at
    once, the computer tracks who fights who according to who won the last
    match.  This makes for a different spin, but you need to have a surplus
    of friends unfortunately.

    The graphics are not great, but they are good.  I especially like the
    explosion from the freefall bombs.  Gravity Force 2 is one of those
    games that doesn't need good graphics, though. The sounds are very
    appropriate and in good quantity.  BiTS even did some sound design (ie,
    the 'clank' when two ships collide was created by hitting an exhaust
    pipe with a cord).

    Another aspect of this game (and many of its counterparts) is the
    statistics it keeps.  It tracks exact minutes you've played, total
    number of shots fired, etc.  I wish it tracked more stuff..  How about
    tracking and storing on disk results from tournaments across several
    sessions?  How about ongoing, individual win/loss records?

    There are other games out in the same genre, but the ones I was able to
    get and try are of a lesser standard.  I don't have AGA, so I couldn't
    try Rocketz or Bratwurst.  If you don't have AGA either (or if you do),
    Gravity Force 2 is an excellent value for the meager download.  Play it
    while we all wait for the network/modem/internet version!

 Hi!

    Glad to see that you made it to issue two!  Welcome, if you are a first
 time reader!  First of all I'd like to thank everyone for all the positive
 support and comments.  Please keep them coming, we want to here what you
 have to say.

    You may notice that some thing have changed.  We are fine tuning the
 magazine in many ways.  You should be aware that the format has changed
 slightly.  For those who are writing reviews, you may want to get our new
 @{"template" link "Template" 0} that will be taking full effect in the next issue.  We have also
 changed our @{"policy" link "info" 0} on reviews.  This magazine is now going to put forth
 the effort on new and old Amiga programs!  So join in and help us. Please
 check out the @{"info section" link "info" 0}.  Make sure also to take part in our readers
 @{"Poll" link "readerspoll" 0}.

    I would also like to give thanks to our first authors in this issue!  I
 hope to see more from outside help.  I would also like to thank David Zvekic
 for pointing out that The Best In Amiga PD was suffering from an error in
 Heddley involving fully defined fonts.  I will now be running his program
 found on Aminet (text/hyper/FixHeddley1.2.lha) to fix it in the future.

    We are also welcoming a new staff memeber this issue, Jason McIntosh!
 He will be writing reviews, primarly games, and taking care of the final
 output check-overs.


 We still want your opinions! Send them to roy@ramiga.cts.com

 Hello,

   I would like to start off by apologizing for not making any comments in the
 first issue of this magazine.  Roy called me up and asked if I would help him
 do this magazine, and I being a person with TONS of spare time on my hands
 (NOT!), said "SURE!".  So we put together a couple of reviews and rushed out
 the first issue, and I was not ready to put in any nots, but I am better ready
 this month...

   I guess I will just use this time to let you all know a little about myself.
 On the IRC you have probably seen me as either Jo_Blo which I no longer use or
 YukonPete which I like better; it suits me...  I have been on the Amiga scene
 since 1987, or maybe it was 88, but I bought my A1000 as soon as it hit the
 market.  I had to: the power supply in my Commodore 128 died...  That is the
 way I have gone through all of my computers up until the Amiga.  I had my
 VIC-20 until I could not stand playing with it's tape drive, then I got my
 Commodore 64 and its power supply finally died, so I got the Commodore-128.
 It went until the A1000 came out.  I stuck with it until the A4000 came out,
 and I got my A3000 at a discount because they were pushing the A4000's.  Then
 last year I got my CD-32.  So out of all those computers I have every one of
 my Amigas and none of the old Commodores...

   So when it comes to the history of this fine computer system that we all
 know and love I am well versed.  I am not very technically knowledgable about
 it, but I can hold my own...
