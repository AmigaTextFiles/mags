Could it be that the demo showing the "advantages" has been provided by
Haage&Partner? Could it be that you have seen it running on a Beta
developer board (the answer is "yes" as we didn't ship any 603 release
products) with probably an older beta version of our PowerUp system
software running? 

I assume that you have seen "advantages" of a Storm C compiled program
running under WarpUp compared to the Storm C compiled version which is
compatible with the PowerUp system software. This is a useless
comparison, because software which is developed for PowerUp with Storm C
is wasting most of the possible performance of the PowerUp boards due to
it's "quick-and-dirty-conversion" concept.
