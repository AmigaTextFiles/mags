As long as software stay compatible anyone can do what they want. H&P's
solution is neither compatible nor very efficient.

Why do you look at P5 as the devil? I don't find H&P any better at all, on
the contrary...!

The difference is that the PowerUp software is based on industri standard,
has remained compatible with the initial releases given out to developers.
H&P's solution disables the PowerUp software and makes 100% compliant
PowerUp software break.

ps. The expressed opionins above are not P5's nor Omnipresence Intl's.
It is just my expressed opinion based on months of discussions with
Phase5 about the PowerUp system and by looking at the StormC solution.
