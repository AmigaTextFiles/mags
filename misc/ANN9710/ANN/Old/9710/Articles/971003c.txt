No. As it is known from your contributions to german-language
newsgroups, you are mixing up things and argueing against phase 5 with
limited knowledge and understanding of the facts.

phase 5 supplies, as I stated, a solution which consists of hardware and
software. We provide a HAL on which every developer can integrate any
solution he likes, while staying compatible. As far as the PowerUp
boards are concerned, we are the system vendor, and believe that we
should control the system software that controls the hardware underneath
the HAL, especially to make sure that all future developments by all the
developers who support PowerUp remain compatible. 

If you want to make a comparison with Microsoft, you should question the
strategy of Haage&Partner, who - as a software and development system
vendor - want to take over full control of the hardware that we deliver.
That means that the kernel, the (only compatible) compiler as well as
some application software - including their java development - come from
one source. They even claim their software could be a standard for
future PPC Amigas from Amiga Inc. - provided that Amiga Inc. let
themselves and their OS development be controlled by the H&P solution,
what H&P doesn't say. 

Now why has Haage&Partner spent so many efforts in developing an
incompatible kernel, which is quite similar to our own system software
and offers no relevant advantages? Could it be that they want to control
the way any future development will go (and sell the software that is
mandatory for the development)? Or do you think that instead of
developing applications which they could sell, they spend their efforts
developing a kernel and give it away for free, just because of idealism?
Everybody may draw an own conclusion or do the comparison as in the
paragraph before... 


Also, your translation was wrong. Ralph Schmidt didn't say "WarpUP may
be compatible with the current boards, but this will change in a week or
two" but said "WarpUp may run on the boards shipped so far, but this
will change in two weeks from now." The difference is small, but
important: WarpUp HAS NEVER BEEN COMPATIBLE, but runs only because
Haage&Partner can currently disable the PowerUp system software. As in
future revision of PowerUp the PPC-library and other parts of our
software will be located in the Flash-ROM (a feature that had been
planned from the beginning regardless of the current haage&partner
situation), WarpUp will not longer run as it is incompatible to our
solution.

Please be more accurate when you are translating statements in the
future.
