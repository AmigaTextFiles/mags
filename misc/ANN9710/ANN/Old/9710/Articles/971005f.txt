Well, i understand your point... but if this is your main interest, why did 
you decline all cooperation with Haage&Partner ? As i was told, they offered 
this once more to your firm, before they actually released WarpOS... in fact 
they even did not leak ANY information about it, before they spoke to Phase 5 
.... i think the HAL to be used with PowerUP should be:

- efficient
- comfortable in usage
- support modern compilers

I think this should be more important than who does the software... why not 
shipping WarpOS with PowerUP ? Then you would not have to call it "a foreign 
solution". I am sure, Haage&Partner would not have a problem with the 
permission to use it for free.

I think it is no use, if Haage&Partner and Phase 5 say things like that to 
each other. I read your statement as to Haage&Partner wanting to overtake the 
market, i read statements from people at Haage&Partner that Phase 5 would want 
to overtake the market and would not deal good with concurrence situations. 
Such statements, i believe have no place in a business situation. If i compare 
Haage&Partner and Phase 5 statements - well, i believe the one of H&P was much 
more fair to the other firm.

Of course you now could say "You are a Haage&Partner fan", but in fact that is 
not the case. Phase 5 and Haage&Partner are both firms for me. Phase 5 did 
great hardware - Haage&Partner did great software.

According to the programmer of WarpOS simply because the new kernel is more 
efficient. And no, he says, this is NOT based on Beta Versions and Developper 
Boards. Also the way it is included into the system would be "more OS legal". 
And if it is so similar, why do you at all have problems with it ?
