True story. I expect the gentleman(and he *is* quite a gentle man...) to
stick his head up and give us his side of the story.

RoyBubba? Perhaps you can chime in here?

Their numbers seem to be legion...;')

Thank the deities that most new computers come with *System CDs*. Since
nothing else has been installed(yet), the fix for this should be pretty
seemless. I can't wait for missing .vxes and .dlls... I love swap files.

I told her that she needed at least 64 megs of EDO ram. Did she listen?

Noper. 

She wasn't listening at the time. Now I have to convince her to let
me tear the thing apart, look at the slots and the simms, and then *try*
and get her the appropriate simm to get her up to 64, where swaps pretty
much go away.

64 megs. 

Gag es moi avec le spoon, silver plate.

Let's write an OS that sells hardware. That'll work.

Carl Sassenrath once said to me that that biggest problem that exists in
OS/Software development is the fact that many programmers get paid by the
line of code.

Think about it. Carl says he is working on a full OS that will come in at
100kb. With Gfx. Hell, if it comes in at 200kb, we won't have to whip him.

Much. ;')

He said he has the bare bones working in 75Kb.

Such are the ways of being a Zen Programming Roshi. Believe me: They are
not like you and me.

Wanna hear my story about Windows 4.00.950b, Xircom modems and Memphis
Registry beta code that was added to the .950b Reseller/OEM install disks?

It's a laugh riot, if spending 4/5 hours on the phone with Xircom Tech
support is your idea of fun, trying to fix a broken PnP install on some
PCMCIA Multi-cards on Samsung laptops.

Something tells me that this is gonna be a very hard sell. ;')

BTW: goto http://www.redhat.com

Learn a little bit about Redhat Linux. Nice installer. Nice stuff. Even has
a desktop that looks just like Windows 95(out of 5 desktops available).
Unlimited connections, too. $US 49.95 for the Intel install CD, too.

Nice educational discounts, too.

InfoWeek went all gushy about it. Called it a "Windows Killer". 

$US49.95 is a nice price.
