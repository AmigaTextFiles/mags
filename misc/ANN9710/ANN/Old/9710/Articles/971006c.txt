This is simply a task which forwards scheduler interrupts to the PowerPC
kernel, which of course does the scheduling and runs in native PowerPC
code (what else?).

Once again, we ONLY want to make sure that customers of our products can
use software based on the PowerUp System Software and the PPC library at
any time. If this means that WarpOS V8+ may not run, it is a consequence
of the design that H&P have been choosen.

And what about very powerful compilers for PPC that run on other
systems, generate ELF format binaries, and can provide the possibility
to compile highly optimized code which may be far more efficient than
the solutions available on the Amiga now? We at least want to have this
option to be able to compile our software for highest performance and
optimized code.

The GNU C for PowerPC supports the ELF format, as well as other
compilers do. We don't write compilers, H&P does. We simply take a
compiler which is available and appropriate, while H&P are able to
modify theirs to support other standards. Why should other compiler
makers follow the H&P standard? And would you expect software vendors
that built VERY professional compilers with prooven performance,
functionality and optimization which run on other systems that they
built a version to support the H&P standard? This, BTW, is also valid
for other kinds of software. 

So, do we really need to have a proprietary binary format that EXISTS
ONLY on PowerUp-Amigas, respectively? I don't think so.

As you said yourself, independent tests would have to proove which
software and which design concept/recommendation is faster. Until this
has been done, I think it is not correct to make statements as you do,
which are written in a way as it would be a fact that WarpUp is faster
or has any other advantages.

??? They built a software that disables ours, and they worked on it
secretly for nearly a year while appreciating our developer support.
This is not what I assume to be cooperative.

We told them that we completely disregard a software that disables the
PowerUp System Software because of the reasons that we publicly
explained.

We punish the users? That's weird. We simply provide a complete
solution, and we provide a HAL. Below the HAL, there is the hardware,
which is of course our proprietary development and may change according
to actual needs of upcoming product developments (such as other PowerUp
boards). This will not affect the software developers who use the HAL,
and also not the users who work with this PowerUp compliant software.

I had a look on it, and I don't find the Voxelspace demo so impressing,
and also not it's speed increase over the 060 version. I also don't find
their Mandelbrot impressing, and I can't see that it is faster than our
Mandelbrot demo at all. Have you seen our real-time CyberGL-based
Lightwave object viewer? Have you seen our MPEG Audio/Video player
operating, even in it's first unoptimized release? I must say, frankly,
that I believe that I have seen more of both solutions right now than
you did.

Didn't I say that the H&P WarpUp kernel does not provide anything new? I
read their description, and their task and message functions, for
example, are a similar copy of the functionalities that our PowerUp
System Software provides - even the names are equal or nearly equal. 


A special final comment on cooperation: Your post may give a strong
impression to readers that phase 5 digital products is not cooperative.
It states at various points that we had declined cooperation. This is a
statement that expresses the position of Haage&Partner, and it must be
seen as a subjective statement. Facts, however, proove that we have
given them all necessary developer support to become a PowerUp
developer. H&P may be of the opinion that we have been uncooperative
because they could not convince us to use their binary format and make
their compiler the development standard. We believe this is a very
personal point of view, and that by repeating this statement they try to
shift the blame for the confusion that their confrontational course may
caused towards us.

Please excuse if I may drop out of the public discussion at this time,
as business duties will keep me more busy - we want to continue bringing
powerful products to the Amiga market. We will probably address this as
well as future issues with more information about our products and the
concepts behind on our web site.
