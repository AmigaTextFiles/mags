Hi!

The problem only is, that their positions do not fit together. As to what H&P 
say, they just find some parts of the Phase 5 Software too inefficient, and 
they don't want a foreign format on Amiga, as to what Phase 5 says, they do 
not want to change anything on this. I said similar things like you did to 
people of both firms also. 

H&P

"We tried our best to get a compromis with Phase 5 several times. But they
 declined every offer for cooperation and they did not want to modify
 the way they go one millimeter."

Phase 5

"H&P did not inform us at all, until it was too late. And they don't use the
 API we are suggesting, not do they use ELF Format."

And none of the two wants to modify this view. Sometimes they appear to me 
like headstrong little children...

But of course, you are right :)
