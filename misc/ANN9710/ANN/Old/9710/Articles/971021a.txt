Very true. One of the main raisons d'etre  of the ICOA is to set
standards. However, this is where there is reason for a set of common
standards that are to be embraced by a good majority of developers.
As is happening at the moment, P5 have produced a proprietary board
design,
provided one SW solution and H&P have provided another.

P5 (presumably) wish to make money through the sale of HW and SW for
their pUP solution whilst H&P wish to present their own SW solution for
the P5 HW.
In such a case, the ICOA cannot intervene directly, since there is a
conflict
here. We can recommend that everyone come to a healthy agreement, and
that the ICOA help in the arbitration, and maybe even set up a WG to
push and develop
a set of standards for the pUP boards. Whether the two companies wish to
go down
that route is upto them.

The pUP is a custom solution that has taken considerable investment and
which is presumably why P5 are miffed since they want to recoup their
investment
and max the performance of their HW. Now P5 could say to the ICOA, here
are the
specs for our board. We want the board to be used by the whole community
and we think the best way for this to happen is for the ICOA to become
the
standards body for the APIs. Then H&P, P5, and other ICOA members could
work on them together. 

However, the ICOA is not the Borg - if a company wishes to offer its
proprietary
technology to us for the benefit of the whole community then that is
fine, but the ICOA
cannot and will not move to force a company into making such a
committment.

P5 is perfectly within its right to control its own technology. H&P is
perfectly within its
right to provide an alternative SW solution. P5 is perfectly within its
right to keep changing elements of its HW to render the H&P solution
inoperable and H&P is perfectly within its right to patch its SW
solution to make it work
again.

The effects of this on the market and the community is a matter for
personal judgement.

Of course, as Ben Hutchings has pointed out, the ICOA does not yet exist
as a formal organisation and so would not be able to do much on a formal
level.
Informally, the TSC and the mailing list members would be delighted to
offer whatever services they can to resolve this issue and move the
Amiga forwards..

If others do release PPC boards, then the issue changes considerably
since
if there are multiple vendors providing HW, then both they and the rest
of the community (developers and owners) would want to see a common set
of APIs allowing for any PPC enhanced application to run on any board
and that
is precisely where the ICOA is designed to fit in, a forum for
co-operation in
mutually beneficial situations. Right now, with P5 being the only
vendor,
they don't have to co-operate with anyone.

As to the status of the ICOA, we are in constant talks with Jeff,
Marilyn (the
HR - read "everything") and the GW2K lawyer. The website is moving ahead
and
the new revision should be up by the end of October. As soon as we are
legal,
the doors will be opened for developers and then, when the ICOA is
moving forwards,
for affiliate (user) members who want to keep track of what is going on
(for
a price of course ;-))
