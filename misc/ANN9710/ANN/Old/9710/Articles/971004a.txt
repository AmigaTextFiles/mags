Yes, and the demo program running under the PowerUp System Software has
also been provided by them. Oh, by the way, was it the "Set Pixel"-Demo
which they have shown you? If so, this demo is as useful as testing a
Porsche by driving backwards.

I am not a software developer, and can just explain it with the basic
understanding that I have, so please excuse if this is not going too
much into the details. We at phase 5 digital products do recommend that
software developers who want to support PowerUp rewrite their programs
in a way that they build software modules in form of tasks which run on
PPC and 68k. In this way, the software is well structured, open for
future developments and object oriented. A simple program for example
could consist of a 68k task which handles the GUI and OS calls, and
calls PPC tasks for executing operations which shall be accelerated by
using the PPC. As we provide comprehensive functionality and a very fast
new message system in our PowerUp System Software, this solution is very
efficient, and it allows full parallel operation of multiple CPUs; in
the example above, the 68k task could continue with execution of
commands while one or more PPC tasks are busy with other stuff, and
wouldn't need to wait until the PPC task(s) returns (unless, of course,
the 68k task would need the result of the PPC task(s) to continue it's
work). 

By using such a structured and object oriented programming approach, the
software is also much more easily updatable. If e.g. GUI and OS calls
would change in future revisions of an OS, the developer would only need
to replace the module that handles the GUI and the OS calls, and
continue to use the other modules.

H&P have been promoting their Storm C with a concept that you simply
recompile the existing C code which has been written for 68k Amiga and
tell the compiler to generate PPC code. This may be very comfortable for
the developer, but is completely unefficient. Not only that in the worst
case you have a random mix of 68k and PPC code, but also the two CPUs
will not run in parallel as it is one continuous program flow which
jumps between PPC and 68k. If a linear code sequence is executed, the
68k and the PPC always work one after the other, in the worst case with
lots of switches and a useless overhead.

A significant loss of performance is the result of this way of porting
applications to the PowerPC. It could result in a scenario where
developers use Storm C, recompile their code, find that it is two times
faster than on a 68060 and decide that this is OK, while with some
thinking and conceptual consideration the program may would work five or
ten times faster than on the 68060. Insofar this is a poor solution from
which maybe a less motivated developer would benefit, being enabled to
do a quick-and-dirty conversion, but not the customer, who would get
products that do not exploit the performance of his hardware at all.
