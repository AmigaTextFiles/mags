Hi!

This is a mail forwarded to me by Henning Tolpinrud, intended for my
Amiga Network News page ( http://www2.vo.lu/homepages/ckemp/News ).
Since I don't include anything that hasn't been said in the
newsgroups, I decided to post it here before putting it on my page.

I am genuinely concerned by the responses I have received.  It is important
to note that Colin was NOT asked to shut down the Amiga users site; he
merely had to change the name from "Fishwrap" and use a different word in
the web address.  Colin himself chose to remove the service altogether,
along with other web pages that have nothing to do with the use of the mark
"FishWrap".  I admit that I do not understand his actions, and they
certainly were not required by the letter that I sent.  If Colin had any
questions or comments prior to removing the web pages, he could have
contacted me.

You should also note that MIT MUST protect its trademarks--or lose them.
Selective enforcement is not an option.

I hope that you all will renew your web pages under a new name and address.

Karin Rivard

I am very dissappointed that you have taken this action. I don't understand
the US trademark laws but I would like to know what there is to gain from
doing this.

You people are unbelievable. You have nothing more important to do than destroy
someone elses' hardwork with things such as trivial as trademark infringement.
Get real. One of our great educational institutions at work. Institutions such
as your are nothing but a con.

Subject: MIT stomping "The almost Daily Fishwrap"

Dear Ms Rivard

After having noticed your harsh reaction towards the free web resource "The
almost daily Fishwrap", and threatening Mr Thompson with legal action for a
trademark infringement you should have noticed much earlier, I think it's
simply an overkill.

I suspect that discussing the whole affair with Mr Thompson is many times more
fruitful than simply stomp him. I suspect that an agreement to give him a free
license for his web site so he can publish news around the Amiga computer and
maybe one or the other excess of the Wintel monopoly as well as his personal
stuff.

In any case, if somebody has the brilliant idea to move the website to Europe,
the loss of any legal action against that site's provider would outweight the
benefit gained therein. Or maybe just move that site to Pakistan or India.

You cannot fight the mobility of information, so a bit of tolerance might buy
MIT a few points with the Amiga community, and free speech activists.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. You are a singularly annoying person.

I removed my Almost Daily Fishwrap site. I removed my Amiga Alley site. I
removed my
personal site. I have nothing left on zNET, so you can stop badgering the
President.

I told zNET to cancel my service.

Are you happy now or do you want to come out here and shoot my cat?

This will cost you.

Ms. Rivard,
I was recently made aware of your letter to Colin Thompson about his
"Almost Daily Fishwrap" and then about the file containing the web page
being left on the server.  This matter seems most rediculous to begin
with, but the fact that you tried to pressure him about a filename is
even more petty.  You probably do not have any rights to filenames named
"fishwrap.html" or whatever the filename was.  That is why the second
letter you wrote is so hard to justify.  Please, use some common sense.
Even in the first instance, I'm sure that he wasn't sitting around his
home trying to think of ways to rip off someone's rights to anything.
All this person was doing was trying to run a web page to help and
inform others with interest in the Amiga computer platform.

In regards to your method of enforcement on the rights to your trademark
FISHWRAP, I believe you have misused your position of power.  I'm no legal
expert but I disagree with your handling of the issue.  The removal of the
term FISHWRAP is understandable but to go so far as to shut down a
non-profit site because they have a file named fishwrap.html is
rediculous.  Technically, a file name is nothing more than an address.
Therefore, you have attempted to remove any address which uses the term
FISHWRAP!  That action goes too far and I believe you owe the violator an
apology for this misunderstanding.

Regards,

I am outraged that a seemingly prestigious institution such as MIT would take
a strong legal position against a small website regarding the use of the word
"fishwrap" that I believe cannot be legally defended as unique to only MIT.
Any postive thoughts I have ever had about MIT have been erased by your
actions.

Sincerely,

The threat of lawsuit for using the word "Fishwrap" must be the most useless
and hillarious thing I've ever heard about. Congratulations!
