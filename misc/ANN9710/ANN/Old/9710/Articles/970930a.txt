(Speaking for myself and not Phase5 in this case)

I was there for 2-3 months observing what압 going on there and I left
because the no valueable contents quotient in the mailinglist went
beyond a scale I couldn앖 accept any longer.
I have several conceptional problems with the ICOA itself and i았e
told these also Sassenrath on some IRC ICOA conference in April/May
I think.(it seems Sassenrath also doesn앖 like what압 going on there
as i haven앖 seen one post by him in the whole time i was in the list.
If my conclusion is wrong i`m sorry.

Basicly..imho the ICOA and the Jay Miner Society represent a
***very*** US centric power balance which only represents a small
subset of the Amiga market.
You see who has founded the thing...

Another issue is that I can앖 see from all the informations i았e got
so far that GW/ICOA(whatever the real link is..) is moving into an
OS direction I don앖 like to see.
I앐 against an evolutionary cludged AmigaOS and yes..i worked on it
the last year and realized it압 not worth it.
If the whole OS philosphy would be equal to ours I wouldn앖 see a
reason against a combined effort on the OS but that압 a serious
commercial problem(a major ICOA construction problem) that I
don앖 think it압 possible at all.
