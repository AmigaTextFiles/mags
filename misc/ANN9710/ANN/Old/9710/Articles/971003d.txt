I have on in a new 4000T that came from QP and warranted by QP.  I am an
animator outputting to video through the Toaster/Flyer system in the tower.
 

The machine worked well for three months and took a shit. Pronounced dead
by my local dealer who called Micropace and then QP.  Micropace wouldn't do
anything but tell us to call QP.  QP don't answer the phone.  They don't
respond to the message or the fax.  A week goes by and I start calling. 
Two more weeks and twenty messages later and nothing from quick shit
packers.

I call micropace  and get called a lameass enduser.  They cant even talk to
me except to tell me it is my problem.  I kept calling them till they
wouldn't take any more of my calls.  They have such great customer service.
 Actually for someone they can sell 20k worth of amiga shit over the last 4
years, they cant even talk to me about their supplier not responding to a
call for warrantee work.

After three weeks of being out of business because QP can't pick up their
phone, I found a place in PA that would fix the 4000T and did.  Cost me
$360.  Two days after I set it to PSI Industries, Jim Davis, a dealer in PA
near QP mails me that he talked to Dave at QP and he has an RMA for me the
tower.  I not only sent it already to PSI but I still couldn't talk to QP. 
Like I am going to send out a $2600 piece to a place that won't answer
their phone messages on a second party RMA???

The machine comes back and work OK.  I am flaming on the newtek oriented
list servs and flaming All the mail addresses at Amiga International. 
Petro starts being my pen Pal. He gives me another phone number. for QP. 
Seems that there is no love lost between AI and QP.  this phone number is
on Dave's desk and rings forward to his car!  He answers this line.

Although I have mail from Jim Davis about how he has forwarded my flame
mail to Dave at QP and the same from Bob Wolter at microshit, a true
corporate shithead, Dave denies being aware of my problem!  He doesn't
contest that I had a valid warrantee claim, supposedly on my claim to him
there on the phone and would send me a check after I fax him documentation
of my expenses.

Then comes the getting the check phase.  That required ten more calls, my
check being in the mail twice. Finally I call him in his care and make him
pull over and write it down.  I got a check fed ex a few days later that
was made out to no one and signed by no one sent to my address with my
city, Kalamazoo spelled Calamazoo.  It did seem to clear but what a pain in
the ass. The email with Bob Wolter on this is choice.

anyway the moral of the story is that Quicpacker is shit packer and buyer
be ware.
