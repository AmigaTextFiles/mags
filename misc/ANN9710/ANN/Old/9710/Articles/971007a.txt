Hi!

The following is a suggestion of Sam Jordan, author of WarpOS. To clear up the 
dispute between Amiga users who should work together he suggests the following:

--- snip ---

"I suggest that as many as possible open-minded programmers who already have
a Board will do a complete comparision test. As many people as possible people
should do this, so that there is no danger, that those programmers are not 
bribed.

Then the results should be posted to the news and discussed. I want to invite 
everybody to lead the discussion in a friendly way, and to bury the dispute 
one and for all. We just want to find the truth, and as long only the parties 
speak who directly participate in one of the systems, they alwayws will be 
accused of being biased and subjective. Because of that i would be happy about 
objective tests, I would join in discussing the results, learn out of them and 
develop WarpOS in a way, that many people get something out of it.

I would be very happy about this and also want to set a sign, that the AMIGA 
community will be appeased. The goal is that both parties accept the other 
solution. It is no problem, you only have to write a script, which exchanges 
the libraries and then reboots, and at once the other system is running (both 
systems parallel, if powerpc.library V7 is running, anyways).

This way the users profit in the most possible way, as they are not fixed to a 
specific system, but can use both of them. Why should we fight each other, if 
we can use both ? Those who do not like WarpOS, use the ppc.library, and 
those, who do not like the ppc.library, use WarpOS.

At the end i want to note, that Sam said several times, that he has not the 
time or the interest to part in flame wars. Please do not send flames to him.
His time is spent better when he continues coding, then when he replies to 
flames.
