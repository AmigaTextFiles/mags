Do you think that the fact that we supplied free developer boards and
all kind of support to them indicates that we "declined all
cooperation"? They did not offer support, but frequently asked us to use
their binary format and make Storm C the only and official development
tool.

In fact, they did develop their software and their strategy over a long
time, and promised all the time that their solution would be compatible
with the PowrUp system software. On the 25th of September they for the
first time informed us about their WarpUp stuff, and started a massive
marketing campaign the next day.

That's what our HAL does. It even does support compilers from different
vendors and on different platforms.

No, and they would have even less problems to see all developers or
users who want to write software buying their Storm C or PowerASM as no
other solution is available.

I am sorry that the situation forces me to speak very frankly, but I
don't see reasons to hide the truth in nice words.

You should read the WarpUp announcement as well as the Amiga guides
enclosed with WarpUp again, and reconsider if you believe the
indications and frank comments about the phase 5 software solution are
fair.

THEY say it is more efficient. THEY claim it to be faster or better. We
deny this. And as it is similar in functionality, why should it take
over the hardware completely and stop software that uses the original
PowerUp System Software from working?
