i> Congratulations, you've just helped try to kill the Amiga.

Not at all.  PUcard IS trying to kill the Amiga by using a half step towards
P5's proprietary A\vaporBox and the A\vaporBox OS.  Else Petro would be happy
about the PUcards and OS coming out, which by reports from WOA-Italy, he
isn't.  It's interesting that folks finally have a solid Amiga company yet
they are not looking towards it for direction.

i> I hope that smiley meant you were joking....

More like a wink with a quick elbow jab in the ribs.  Just trying to encourage
folks to think before following this PUcard craze...
