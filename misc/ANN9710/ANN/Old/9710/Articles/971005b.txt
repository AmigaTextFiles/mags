Phase 5 has all the way been promoting OPEN standards, like the System V
ABI, ELF etc. while H&P has been promoting their own proprietary system.

Can you explain what P5 gains from this? They are not trying to sell
software, they are trying to sell a complete system. H&P tryes to get a cut
of the software market by promoting their tools and systems as a complete
solution while P5 tries to make sure that as many developers as possible
can develop and use PowerUp by prividing Open standards and free tools.

Imagine this:
What if H&P sais 'Everyone who wants to use the extended hunk format must
licence it from us'?

Where did P5 say 'To develop for PowerUp you have to licence our software'?
That is the MAJOR difference between H&P and P5!

I wouldn't call software that enforces people to buy H&P software 'great
software'

If it stops me from using software I bought the CSPPC board for, it will
bug me like hell.
Also, I'd like to see an independant comparison between the PowerUp
software and WarpOS before I comment on the efficency part. I have been
working with Ralph Smidth for 3-4 months on the PowerUp software and there
has been significant speedups due to suggestions and testing from my end.
And this even without having to disassemble 1 single line of the PowerUp
kernel.
