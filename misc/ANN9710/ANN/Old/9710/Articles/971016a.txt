Amiga Inc apparently has quite detailed plans that are still "under
wraps".  The TSC members (and possible Jason Compton) heard about these
plans when they had their meeting with Amiga Inc back in August, but
they signed an NDA which prevents them from revealing anything for the
time being.  I would guess that Amiga Inc wants to get some more
employees, ready to start work, before they unveil these plans to the
public.  While it seems the ICOA *wiil* be the official developer
support organisation, it won't actually be able to function until this
is all under way.
