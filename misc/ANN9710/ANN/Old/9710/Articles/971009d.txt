That is usually what the programer wants when he stops interrupts...

Rotfl! So you suggest that AI and Phase5 use Amigas for VHDL design:)
I'd prefer a SunUltra for that even if the chips are not meant to go into a
Sun machine.
Btw, the SSL support code in IBrowse is cross compiled on a Linux box
simply because it is much faster and cheaper than using SAS/C if you want
the same compile time. What is wrong by chosing the system that gets the
job done best. Linux on a P133 compiles our code faster but AmigaOS runs
the code nicer.

Not all functions in V8 exists in V7...
