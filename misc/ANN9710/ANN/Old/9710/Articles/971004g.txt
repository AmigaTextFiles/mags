What Haage&partner says is complete nonsense. The PowerUp-CPUs work as a
real multiprocessing system with full parallel operation of both CPUs.
Even more than that: The PowerUp system software is ready to work with
ANY number of CPUs, and if there would be demand we could build High-End
boards with several PPCs on it (this is not a product announcement!). 

Smooth parallel operation of both CPUs is a question of the system
software, of course, and as Haage&Partner doesn't use our comprehensive
solution but their WarpUp kernel which hacks the hardware and is
completely incompatible to our system software and our libraries, this
is probbaly the reason for their problems. As they do not know the
functionality of the hardware beneath our HAL I can't see how they could
make use of all the functionality of the PowerUp Hardware. BTW, H&P's
concept of shared memory access is completely outdated for a solution
that shall conceptually direct towards future OS versions with
multiprocessing and memory protection, just to name a few advanced
features.
