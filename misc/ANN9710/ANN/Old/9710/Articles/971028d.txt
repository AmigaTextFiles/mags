FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 22nd 1997

The Amiga RC5 Team effort is proud to announce the next step in continueing
participation in the RSA Secret Key Challenge contest: to break the RC5-64 key
challenge. After only 61 days of participation in the 210 day RC5-56 challenge
the Amiga RC5 Team effort reached a seventh overall ranking out of over 4000
teams with an estimated 30,000 computers participating. On the last day of the
effort the gathering speed of amongst others over a thousand Amigas culminated
in a third daily ranking, which proves the vigour with which the Amiga
community attacked the problem.

The Amiga RC5 Team effort has successfully and beyond expectations entered the
rankings and laid the foundation for a worldwide bundling of the Amiga
community, and proves beyond doubt the spirit and enthusiasm living for a
platform many have believed to be dead. The past effort has proven that these
people were wrong; the acquisition of the Amiga technology by one of the
largest computer manufacturers worldwide, Gateway 2000, can only underline
this fact.

To enhance further exposure for the Amiga and its enthusiastic following the
Amiga RC5 Team effort has started tackling the 64 bit key challenge. We believe
that our showing can be even better with the coming PowerPC client and the
participation which now starts at the very beginning instead of playing catch
up.

The future holds other promising cooperative efforts as well, the next
generation client can be used to participate in other efforts such as
Search for Extra Terrestrial Life (SETI), Mersenne primes, a distributed chess
engine and perhaps searching the human genome for cures to various diseases.
Therefore this effort not only serves as a vehicle for promoting the Amiga,
but also lays the foundations for projects that at some time in the future
will benefit all of mankind.

The Amiga RC5 Team effort is also providing a mailinglist as a forum for the
discussion on above topics and the effort in general.

Sincerely,

Amiga RC5 Team effort coordinator
