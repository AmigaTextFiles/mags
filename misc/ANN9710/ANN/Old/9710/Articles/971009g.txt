UAE, raytracing and audio encoding are three of the purposes your machine
can never be fast enough for. :-)

They probably use many machines in parallel, something that UAE wouldn't
profit from at all.

They are probably optimized for I/O rather than raw CPU power. Not a good
platform for UAE either. :-)

The limited bandwidth of the PCI bus prevents UAE from running graphics-
intensive games at 800x600 or 640x480 (where every lo-res pixel has to be
quadrupled), no matter how fast your CPU is. However, it is pretty hard
to find something that does _not_ run at full OCS speed if you use
-O 320:240:xyl on a PPro/Pentium2. Try that with your K6, too.

Right. But you are comparing apples with peaches. Compare an A3000/ECS in
8 colours with UAE in OCS/8 colours, please. UAE's blitter emulation is
actually faster than the pixel-by-pixel CPU access that Picasso96 uses
with the regular IPrefs (and even FastIPrefs, AFAIK) to draw the tiled
backdrop.

He asked if UAE can use graphics cards to speed things up.

This is a somewhat weird chain of conclusions: _Because_ the Amiga uses
graphics cards _and_ UAE is slower than an Amiga equipped with a PicassoIV
or Cybervision*, it _isn't_ as fast as an A3000 _w/o_ a graphics card?

>At least you didn`t say that it was as fast as a gfx card Amiga!

It is not.

Actually, it is higher end to an A4000 in some aspects, sadly enough.

A PentiumII-300 is available today, isn't it?

Does "not being equipped with a graphics card" imply that there is something
wrong with an Amiga? Oh... Just like in the PC world. :-)

I've received reports from freaks running WinUAE on overclocked PentiumIIs
(337.5 MHz). Somehow, those machines must have been available to them. However,
you are absolutely right when claiming that probably 98% of all existing PCs
are not powerful enough to run WinUAE adequately - and this is even covered in
the documentation. Search for the string "1998". :-)

This is very questionable. By the end of 1999, WinUAE will be available as an
IA64 binary, running on 700+ MHz CPUs with 100+ MHz memory and 66 MHz PCI
or even faster AGP buses, while the Amiga community (particularly George Noel)
will still devote itself to a neverending flame war about whether that new
machine AI is trying to sell to them actually deserves to be called "Amiga" -
after all, it is lacking all those cutely-named custom chips and doesn't run
any of the hardware-banging old software - except through, you guessed it,
an emulation like UAE.

>There's not much difference between a PPro/233 and a K6/200, BTW.

With gcc-compiled binaries, the low locality of UAE's memory accesses and
the high amount of PCI traffic UAE causes, the PPro (on a Natoma or LX
board) beats the K6 hands down.

>They're both VERY fast chips, and I severely doubt there's much difference

Judging from the feedback I've gotten from K6 users, the PPro is the platform
of choice for UAE, only to be beaten by the PentiumII at an at least
30% higher clock rate.
