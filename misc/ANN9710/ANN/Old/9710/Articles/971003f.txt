The version of the story that appears on the Site is definitely mixed
up.  In it, the reporter has Gateway commited to releasing a
redesigned, cost reduced ($1000) version of the 4000 within a year.
That's a far cry from what I got out of the original AUoH posting,
where in responce a question about the feasibility of reducing the
cost of the 4000, he suggested that as much as a $1000 could come off
the price IF they redesigned the chipset and motherboard.  I missed
the part where he said this was a definite project in the works

I don't want to rain on anyone's parade out of an inherent tendency
toward malice and mayhem.  But...

Doesn't it strike anyone else that the Lisle presentation is a just a
little too vague and a little too informal to be considered an
official product announcement cum release dates? 

For example, the OS release date is "scheduled" for six months once
the full staffing is assembled.  And the target date for new hardware
is a year away when they haven't even commited to the new generation
CPU yet???  IMHO, this seems pretty iffy stuff.  Not unlike the
Amigadroid side of Lisle getting the better of his Gateway employee
side: wanting to say the things that those Amiga users, all Amiga
users wanted to hear -- and which probably are more or less true
*possibilites*. 

Maybe I'm just paying too little attention to the buzzwords (NEW
Hardware, Very Soon Now...) and too much attention to the syntax and
contexts and qualifiers.  I don't see commitment here.

Everything he (reportedly) said is logical and welcomed, but... is it
really all that much more than Petro has been saying.

Maybe.  Time will ultimately tell.
