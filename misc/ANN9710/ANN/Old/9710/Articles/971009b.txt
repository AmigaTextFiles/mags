That I앐 part of the NSD commitee is no secret. You can read all
the members in the TD64 draft.
What this has to do with the NSD is beyond me.

I앐 not here to play cheap tricks with you. Youre the one which

You talked about in some "annonymous style" about me though you
don앖 know me at all.
I never talked about Mr Vermeulen in the News or anywhere else
before this nice event.
That youre part of the Haage&Partner fog was told me.

1) and 2) make clear that *I앐* not the one which controlls Phase5.
Phase5 is controlled from the technical side by Mr. Carda.

Wolf압 words about "object oriented" may not be 100% correct from
a programmer압 standpoint but which inaccuracies do you mean ?
Isn앖 it accurate that:

that the company H&P planned this for months...probably since last
year.
that the company H&P told that Phase5 on thursday and that Phase5
told them directly that this won앖 be accepted. Netherless Mr. Haage
didn앖 cared for this.
that the company H&P never cared for the initial Elf & System V4 ABI
definition we as the System vendor defined for the *AmigaOS* PowerUP
Kernel.
that the company H&P tries to establish their compiler as the standard
future AmigaOS compiler
that the company H&P tries to establish their PowerPC kernel to
enforce their position in the market and to AmigaInc.
that the comapany H&P resourced the Phase5 ppc.library to gain
informations for their own kernel to enforce their kernel as
the new standard with the usage of their integrated tools.
that the company H&P never really cared for the PowerUP System which
showed their almost non existing feedback.
that the company H&P wants to majorly hurt the Phase5 PowerUP project
by offering an own kernel.
that the company H&P missused their developer status to do this behind
the back of Phase5.

*You* and your friends at H&P know exactly what they did.
I don앖 assume theyre too dumb to see that...they only thought
they could get through with this like they got through with their
parallel library to work around the ELF and System V4 ABI rule for
the AmigaOS ABI.
Phase5 meant with support for alternatives *OSes* support for Netbsd
and Linux for example. Your kernel is no OS like PowerUP is no OS.
PowerUP is a kernel to allow Phase5 to adopt to own hw changes quickly
and to define a portable API for the *next* native OS. May this be
real new AmigaOS which is worth to be called *new* or may this be for
the OS we앏l use on the ABox.
H&P sabotages this plan and the project in a not excusable way.

Wolf used the words "Open" in the way to provide a standard format and
ABI for the application developers so they have the freedom of choice
for compiler&tools. Haage also had the choice to made their compiler
compatible to these 2 standards and widen their market on other
platforms.
Wolf made clear that Phase5 will control their hardware and won앖
allow other companies to control our project.

Nice flame...but haven앖 your parents taught you that you shouldn앖
mention YOUR name at the first place when you mention several people.
(That was a smart flame)
That압 exactly what i did.
All these people contributed to the *design* and that압 what you can
read above.

Sorry but all commitments which H&P *showed* look very weak from
looking back what they았e done 1 week ago.
Why don앖 you tell us what H&P did after the fair until end of March
to show their commitment Suddenly they wanted to talk again after
Prodad made their ADE gcc pOS statement.
And they presented their "we don앖 care for your rules parallel
ppc.library.
All these nice events show this "commitment" in a very interesting
light.

Fine.

Do you think some rethoric will hide the point ?
The point was that i have no problems to add things which
make sense in the base concept of PowerUP. Expecially for
H&P I also added a debugger interface which they are for
in the first meeting end of october 96.
A forbid makes no sense in the design and therefore i told
them that i add semaphores...

Oh sure...if they didn앖 wanna play by the base rules they should
do their own hardware.
Their lack of response shows they didn앖 even try to ask for things
in the context of the base design.

Shorten crisis ?..Haage can produce as every other PowerUP developer
software which follows Phase5압 sw API rules. If they can앖 accept
this rule they should search for other hardware companies which
may want to play by their rules.

how you jump from StormC to prejudieces against Mr. Haage i can앖
follow. I았e talked with them in October and November again...that
i had problems with Haage after their April "we don앖 play
by the ELF & System V4 ABI rules" is a consequence of the issue
and after the May rumour about their resourced ppc.library + own
internal kernel and their now "stab in the back" WarpUP product
my openness for that company is non existing.
Maybe you ask your boss about the October 95 events where i got
a letter by them with a licence contract of one of my products.
I phoned them and told them that i앐 not interested and told them
to ask the phxasm author for supplying an assembler for their
compiler. If i didn앖 like them i had ignored this completely and
hadn앖 told them a competing assembler author as a replacement.
And i told Mr. Haage straight into the face(on phone) that my
opinion about the compiler isn앖 very high but there were no
personal prejudies against Mr Haage involved.

They define *their* ABI only *their* compiler supports.
If you can앖 see that others see that without a problem.

Where is the connection about Java and meeting me ?..nowhere.
The connection was where you tried to badmouth me at the top of your
article based on the gossip inside the H&P circle without ever have
met me..have contact with me by email which i remember..or in some
newsthread which may have been a more understandable reason to try
what you tried.
But..the key issue is that I았e NEVER badmouthed you...

Obviously Haage압 and Phase5압 interests are mutal exclusive.
Phase5 gave them the chance to establish themselves as the leading
PowerUP application developer by free board support and the first
board we gave out in early November.
H&P thanked us this by a stab in the back.

I didn앖 care for rest of your article...i only reacted on the
badmouthing. Now you have your answer.

>When I quote a .readme signed with your name, downloaded from Phase 
5's Website,

Which readme and what should that readme proove ?
That I앐 a member of the TD64 commitee like Ralph Babel, Michael
B Smith, O. Kastl, DKB, Junod, B. Moellemann,Jamie Cooper.....and
guess what Wrobel was also a member in the commitee before he chose
to leave and release the NSD specs.
Am I now a bad evil enemy which resides in the evil empire Phase5
because we chose not to support NSD and agreed in common on TD64 ?
Guess what..this TD64 example showed that the evil empire
Phase5 can cooperate which H&P probably thinks we can앖 and it압 even
possible with people that have known big egos....I don앖 deny i have
no big ego but that seems to be the case for every programmer.
So...after all...the TD64 example was a bad one to proove not being
able to cooperate by me.

Why do you think i would blame you for not supporting PowerUP.
That압 your personal decision.

The only thing I made clear by telling everybody who was
badmouthing me here where his bias is.
My bias is clear...yours weren앖 clear for many people reading
this.


Well..that압 my last contribution to this thread as i았e better
things to do.
