That's right.  They OK'd the ICOA.

We're in the process of getting incorporated right now...  Amiga Inc. is
helping us with that, however since they have alot of work on their own,
this isn't moving very fast.

And ofcourse: we aren't pushing them very hard on this... aslong as they
haven't hired a technical staff, there is noone there that the ICOA can talk
to anyway.  When that staff gets hired, we expect they'll be able to move
faster too, and help more with the ICOA issues.... you know... more hands
and stuff... :-)
