Howdy,


Here are a few differences I've seen when testing a PowerUP 604 200Mhz
060 between Phase5's Demoprogs that come with the board, and the
WarpUP Demoprogs. I don't know the technical details behind what
I discovered, I just write how it is:

First, I think it's a bad joke that Phase5 doesn't even supply an
install-script that installs all libraries etc. for a board that
costs that much. It took so long for the board to be released,
why isn't it possible for a programmer to perhaps take 1 day and
make an install-script and supply the proper icons.
Most parts on the CD are either .lha, and if not,
many have no icon and you have to search for them. Since all people
that buy such a boards are freaks, I guess that's not tragic, but
it left me in a bad mood soon after installing the board...

On the other hand, the html-and demo-part on the CD (it's a CD-R) is
done very nice, good previews of upcoming software.

What bothers me most with the phase5-programs is that sometimes they
work, sometimes they don't. Since these are 3rd-party products I
can't tell wether they are buggy or wether its Phase5's fault that
they don't work correctly.

I can't run the Mountains and Plane demos, I always get Error 20
(I tried it from shell, too, all the args, but they don't work. And
since there is no manual for them supplied, and "Error 20" doesn't
say anything to me, what can I do...). Hmm, it probably means
"not enough memory", but who knows ?

The LWShow Demo is probably the best one. It really shows the power.
The bad part: When you run LWShow twice, the objects are displayed
slower than on an 060. Could be a badly programmed LWShow, could be
lack of Multitasking in Phase5's ppc.library, I don't make a conclusion
here. Funny: When you Auto-Rotate both objects, and move your mousepointer
like crazy, they rotate faster ???

ISISPPC... I discovered that the cause why it was so slow was lack
of FAST-RAM, so that was my mistake in the first place. When you have
enough, you can view MPGs at real-time on a 16 or 24bit WB, really
cool ! BUT: First you have to be able to start it. Sometimes it
works, sometimes it doesn't. There are times where it always says
"ppc.library not found". What a joke. It has always been in LIBS and
still is in LIBS. Sometimes it works when started from WB, sometimes
from shell, sometimes it quits at the beginning with above error,
sometimes the window appears but then hangs, I don't know. I discovered
that after the ppc-lib-error you can turn of the computer, turn it
back on, and it works. But that's not sure...

The Mandelbrot and LWShow Prog also has problems with finding the ppc.library
sometimes, but not as often as ISISPPC, which doesn't work nearly in
3 out of 4 cases. Could be a bug in ISISPPC, I don't know...

And yes, I installed the ppc.library and other libs from the update-
disk (after digging through the disk without icons...)

Now to WarpUP. Double-click on the WarpUP-Icon, try all demos, and
all of them work. And they really show how cool the board is !
Finally, the Voxel-Demo is really breathtaking !!! Looks like a 3D-
gfx board on a PC-clone game, but no, it's an Amiga :-) No flickering,
superfast, it's superb. All the WarpUP-Demos work, without problems,
without "not finding a library" or something. All Warpup-Demos are
written by Haage&Partner.

Conclusion: Phase5 demos are written by 3rd party programmers. They either
have bugs or don't work at all (and if it's lack of memory, they are
"missing good style guide error-messages"), and if not, the
Phase5-library is buggy.

WarpUp: All demos work (and they have Icons, too :-)), but of course
written by the Haage&Parnter-guys themselves. And that will probably
be the main problem with WarpUp: Lack of 3rd-party software.

However, if Phase5's solution continues to work that unstable, what
then ?

From a "stupid-user-icon-clicker" point of view, the Warup-software,
sorry, Warpup software (although the first name would be better
concerned the situation we have at the moment :-)) is superb, and the
Phase5-software sucks. It is probably different from a programmer or
marketing (3rd party software support) point of view.

Sorry Phase5, but you left a bad first impression, and sometimes
a first impression is the most important one. However, as an Amiga-
freak I am used to "wait until it gets better". And last but not least,
the Hardware is great !

Grüsse, Claude
