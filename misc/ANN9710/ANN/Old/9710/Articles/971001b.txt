   My five cents: I don't think that this release scheme makes sense either.
Before you can sell an OS update, you have to be able to build the OS from
scratch and you also have to take the time to put the product through QA.
And just 6-8 months is very little time. Compare that to the 12+ months
it took to develop the AmigaOS 3.1 update. What makes me suspicious is that
all these statements came from higher life forms known as management while
the company currently is practically free of software engineers. Any claim
about product availability will probably come from planning software bundling.
So AmigaOS "3.5" will probably be the 3.1 ROM with the 3.1 Workbench plus
some bundled software. With enough marketing effort, they might even get away
with it, but it's also very likely that they'll catch a lot of flak. Without
proper planning the whole thing is almost certain to backfire like the Amiga
Surfer package. Yes, that's the pessimistic perspective, but given how the
company operated in the last few years I haven't got a single reason to
believe in an optimistic alternative.
