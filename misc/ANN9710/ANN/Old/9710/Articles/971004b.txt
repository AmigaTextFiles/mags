hmmm i just don't get everyones arguement in this newsgroup we were all happy that Phase 5 did not use pOS as the OS for the PowerUP boards because then the hardware would be restricted by the software, thus the full cababilties of the hardware might not be put too use.

also another reason is that then prodad would have had control of where the PowerUP market would go.... IE like what those bastards at microsoft do to the peecee market.... they tell the users what they need, even if its crap and another company puts out a better product we will destory them by dirty tactics kind of attiude..

In my opionion the Hardware manufacture should always control the software/kernal/OS of what runs ontop of there hardware as then they won't be restricted by a 3rd party and can choose the right direction for the future.  

So if we Amigans hated the idea of pOS being the OS for the powerUP boards and we hate how mircosoft control the peecee market then why should we want to go with the warpUP concept as this is just the same as those 2 mention!!!!!
