Hi!

Well, some of you probably already have heard that the ppc.library of Phase 5 
of the PowerUP Boards causes problems, when you switch often between 68k and 
PPC CPU, causes great slowdowns. Especially for games and emulators this is 
quite problematic. But it is a software problem, not a hardware problem.

The Firm Haage&Partner, known for their StormC compiler, have now done 
something about it. They developped an OS expansion called "WarpOS - The 
WarpSpeed Solution", which replaces the functionality of ppc.library and 
partially also that of exec.library. WarpOS is mainly coded in PPC Assembler, 
and it is VERY fast.

Some of the features WarpOS provides:

- PPC Native Multitasking functions
- Memory Protection
- Fast 68k/PPC Communication and Context-Switching
- PPC Native Signalling and Messaging
- Special Support for MMU and Caches (You can manipulate them with some
  nice library functions)
- Tutorial about PPC Game Coding
- Demos: Voxelgraphics demo and fractal program and some more stuff
- Extra stuff: The first PPC c2p algorithm and some PPC Memory-Copy Functions
- Benchmark program
- Most functions will be automatically handled by StormC
- ...

The only disadvantage of WarpOS is, that when you start a WarpOS program, 
ppc.library using programs won't run any longer (until the next reset). But 
well, i expect most developpers will use WarpOS anyways. Especially because it 
is much faster. Haage&Partner said, especially about game coding "game coding 
under PowerUP simply needs WarpOS, the ppc.library just causes too many delays 
when doing a context-switch".

Well, WarpOS seems to be an easy to use and efficient solution. It is Freeware 
and will probably soon show up on the Unofficial PowerUP Site at 
http://hem.passagen.se/studiox/powerup/index.html. It also is already found at 
my BBS telnet 194.123.83.1, login WarpUP, Password WarpUP.

I expect it to showup on Aminet and on http://www.haage-partner.com soon, too, 
of course...

In the docs there is written that the Voxelgraphics-Demo runs on the PPC603e 
about 3 times faster than on a 50 MHz 060 CPU !!! And on the PPC604e it will 
run even faster.
