You really think this is scary? All that we want to do is to insure that
on a PowerUp board, the software developed by us or by others using the
different available development packages can run AT ANY TIME. We do not
want to see our users getting frustrated because they have to make a
plan which software they may run in parallel or not. We spend work and
money in free software and services such as CyberGL native and the MPEG
stuff (not to mention our comprehensive PowerUp system software), we
provide a free development system, and yes, we also gave out certain
free developer hardware. Isn't it really scary that H&P follows a path
that disables all the results that come out of these efforts? I believe
so. We are not against compatible alternatives, and we supported H&P and
their efforts all the time while they always promised us their stuff
would be completely compatible with ours - until, surprise surprise,
last week.

??? Do you really think that's a solution? I can already see the flame
and hate postings from users who would have to reset their system when
they want to use a PowerUp compliant program after they have started a
WarpUp-based program before.

What do you mean? At this moment, there is no other PPC hardware. If
someone would come up with such a hardware, it would make sense that we
negotiate and discuss a platform-independent compatibility standard -
and we would be ready for that. 

Software-wise the competition argument is useless, as

You may let users of the PowerUp boards speak for themselves, if they
want a software that disables many of the applications and the utility
and library software that they got with their boards or buy from other
vendors.

As we appreciate freedom of choice, we are happy to see these efforts
and will support them as good as we can.

We support any developer who wants to build a compiler (see above) or
anything else (which is compatible). Looks like there will soon be two
free products on the market. The H&P compiler costs a lot of money, and
people may be forced to buy it to develop under WarpUp. We do not want
developers to use our solution because of a short-term economical
interest, but I must assume that H&P does want that. And we are not in a
conflict as we provide the PowerUp System Software as a part of our
product solution, and do not sell own software products. You may ask
other software vendors if they see a problem in the H&P approach.

Not quite right. We have choosen an industry-standard which allows to to
development for PowerUp using tools running on other system, too. 

As a matter of fact, I believe this whole mess started in the early
times when we were looking for a powerful PPC compiler to support
PowerUp. We decided to use the ELF binary format because it opens up
many options, such as using powerful compilers available on other
systems or free compiler such as the GNU. H&P *always* wanted to push
their "extended-Hunk-Format" and make the Storm C the "official" and
only PowerUp development tool - but of course not fro free...

solution.

Do we hinder them to speak? We just bring our arguments, as H&P does.
And we protect those developers who develop on top of our software
solution by making sure their software runs on our boards. Just as a
side note, imagine how much support trouble can be caused if the H&P
software disables ours for the software vendors as well as us.

We can make sure that compatible software will work on our boards, and
H&P may make sure that their software is compatible or not.

It is a conceptual problem and covers issues such as programming style.

?? Which falling out? There's a similar situation: ProDAD always wanted
to convince us that their product is so great and we should adopt it as
a standard, as H&P did in the past nine months. Well, we couldn't see
the advantages of their concept (and in my personal opinion, their pOS
is - even on 68k - still far from being a complete OS rather than a
replacement for some GUI and middleware parts of the Amiga OS)

So far they could not present e.g. a running PPC version of their
ArtEffects software under their WarpUp kernel - and I thought they
sinply need to recompile the code with Storm C...

Then you should ask them to make their JAVA compatible with our PowerUp
system software, so that their JAVA and e.g. a VRML plugin for a Web
Browser which uses our PPC-native CyberGL library would work together.
What would YOU say if these two products would only work exclusively?
Whom would you blame?

Amiga Inc. is or will be the system vendor of their own solution. If
they'd be interested in using technology from us, we are happy to
cooperate with them. if Amiga Inc. decides to port their OS to the
PowerPC and update it, we would for sure apply for an OS license for our
current and future developments. But this is a completely different
issue, I wouldn't compare Amiga Inc. with H&P.

Nice comparison ;-) But we are not reacting on a competition in a
commercial meaning of the word, but only on an attempt to take over the
control over a hardware platform, which is driven by strong commcercial
interests of H&P.

 
> Your closed system and control over everything attitude stinks. 

What do you mean? We have developed a very complex hardware concept, and
the first product of this new line is out now. Other products will
follow, which may offer different options. To make sure that software
will be compatible, we provide a HAL. From that level on, it is an open
system. Software such as WarpUp that hacks the hardware may not be
compatible with other baord version when there are new developments and
hardware or revision changes. And the hardware design of our own
products WILL remain under our control.

As a matter of fact, someone must control a system (well, not really
someone but somesoftware ;-)) Why should it be the software that has
been hacked by a third party, who has reengineered our software, does
not know about the full functionality and options of the hardware, and
who only claims his software would be better than ours in a massive
marketing campaign, which very directly indicates that our software
would not be sufficient?


> Do you
> want to be the Microsoft of the Amiga world? 

No, but I definitely believe H&P want to be that, and their strategy
look like they had their training lessons there.

??? As a matter of fact, some of these companies seemed not to be
interested in our support or readyness for cooperation, because they all
followed own projects which they have given higher priority, what is
their own decision. It was e.g. ProDADs decision to focus on their pOS
and obviously not follow their first announcements to support PowerUp
with ported version of their software. Well, so we have a 68k pOS
prerelease now, but no PowerUp Adorage or other useful product from
them. H&P had and appreciated our support, and now consequently are
trying to cut us and our system software development off.

It is your choice which system you may prefer, but I don't think it is
fair (do you say "politically correct" in the US) to say that we would
lock out free will and the freedom of choice while we just want to
prevent us from being locked out from the control/influence on the
development of and on our own product. 

Also, again I have to reinforce that we can see no advantages of the H&P
software. It is of course promoted by them as being superior, but they
will have to proove, and we are sure that our solutions provides a
better concept and performance.

Yes, and the demo program running under the PowerUp System Software has
also been provided by them. Oh, by the way, was it the "Set Pixel"-Demo
which they have shown you? If so, this demo is as useful as testing a
Porsche by driving backwards.

I am not a software developer, and can just explain it with the basic
understanding that I have, so please excuse if this is not going too
much into the details. We at phase 5 digital products do recommend that
software developers who want to support PowerUp rewrite their programs
in a way that they build software modules in form of tasks which run on
PPC and 68k. In this way, the software is well structured, open for
future developments and object oriented. A simple program for example
could consist of a 68k task which handles the GUI and OS calls, and
calls PPC tasks for executing operations which shall be accelerated by
using the PPC. As we provide comprehensive functionality and a very fast
new message system in our PowerUp System Software, this solution is very
efficient, and it allows full parallel operation of multiple CPUs; in
the example above, the 68k task could continue with execution of
commands while one or more PPC tasks are busy with other stuff, and
wouldn't need to wait until the PPC task(s) returns (unless, of course,
the 68k task would need the result of the PPC task(s) to continue it's
work). 

By using such a structured and object oriented programming approach, the
software is also much more easily updatable. If e.g. GUI and OS calls
would change in future revisions of an OS, the developer would only need
to replace the module that handles the GUI and the OS calls, and
continue to use the other modules.

H&P have been promoting their Storm C with a concept that you simply
recompile the existing C code which has been written for 68k Amiga and
tell the compiler to generate PPC code. This may be very comfortable for
the developer, but is completely unefficient. Not only that in the worst
case you have a random mix of 68k and PPC code, but also the two CPUs
will not run in parallel as it is one continuous program flow which
jumps between PPC and 68k. If a linear code sequence is executed, the
68k and the PPC always work one after the other, in the worst case with
lots of switches and a useless overhead.

A significant loss of performance is the result of this way of porting
applications to the PowerPC. It could result in a scenario where
developers use Storm C, recompile their code, find that it is two times
faster than on a 68060 and decide that this is OK, while with some
thinking and conceptual consideration the program may would work five or
ten times faster than on the 68060. Insofar this is a poor solution from
which maybe a less motivated developer would benefit, being enabled to
do a quick-and-dirty conversion, but not the customer, who would get
products that do not exploit the performance of his hardware at all.
