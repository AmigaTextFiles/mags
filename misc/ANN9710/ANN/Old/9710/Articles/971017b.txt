DKB had a problem with the landlord at his place of business.  It seems
that the landlord didn't consider flooding when it rained to be a
problem because whenever the landlord came by to inspect the reported
problem it wasn't raining and so it wasn't flooded.  DKB considered that
an adequate reason to not pay the rent (after many months of putting up
with it waiting for something to be done).

DKB is no longer at that place of business.  The phone lines have been
rerouted to an answering machine that he doesn't get time to access very
often, his inventory and equipment has been rerouted to his house where
it has been forced into a space only so large as to prevent divorce and
small enough to make useful work something of a challenge.

The Inferno card has been delayed due to inadequate resistors (as I
recall) being placed on the output causing massive blooming problems due
to the monitor being significantly (dangerously) overdriven.  Dean is
currently kicking himself quite hard for this.  He has told me that the
board will have to be respun as a result and he can't do that until he
can find the right stuff in the right boxes.  Last I heard, this was his
status.

I don't think too many people want that Inferno card more than I do, so
I am trying to stay on top of it.  

I asked him to post this information to the net and he didn't seem to
get around to it.  Dean, if you are mad at me, don't be.  Your customers
needed to know most, if not all, of this.
