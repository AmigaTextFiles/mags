Hi!

f9> Is then P5 obliged to tell H&P that they need to modify their kernel?

No, they are not. But well, i guess Sam Jordan will do as always... get the 
information about what changed from the source -> directly out of ppc.library.
He did that not for the first time. I do not think, P5 can change it all the 
time, BTW, would add confusion to the people using ppc.library also ("Uuuh, 
that program by mistake overwrote my ppc.library... uuuh, nothing runs 
anymore..."). Also, WarpOS would not be the only thing that would get 
problems. Linux PPC also does not use ppc.library (with official OKAY from 
Phase 5 !!!) and neither does FusionPPC (okay, a modified ppc.library...)

Then WarpOS will be adapted to the changes. Worked fine till now (there were 
LOTS of changes).

f9> Doesn't anyone have a clue about what a HAL is?

HAL = Hardware Abstract Layer

(The thing ppc.library does not have... inside ppc.library the 
Hardware-dependent and independent parts are mixed).

In WarpOS we have:

powerpc.library - Hardware-dependent part
warp.library - Hardware-independent part

In case a different hardware (also possible PPC Boards from other 
manufacturers) is used, only powerpc.library has to be adapted. (warp.library 
is the HAL)
