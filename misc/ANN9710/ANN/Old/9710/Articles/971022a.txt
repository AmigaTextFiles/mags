The Blizzard603e PowerUp boards are not yet shipping - we are working
hard on getting them out by November, at the Amiga show in Cologne. 

All board are mechanically fdesigned to fit into the A1200 desktop case.
As a matter of fact, mecahnically even the BVisionPPC graphic card would
fit into the A1200 desktop case. There are, however, two issues that may
make a tower case necessary, which are a) CE (or FCC) considerations
which may force us to offer this products for use in towers only (which
we can verify after all last-minute design changes are incorporated) and
b) possible restriction of weak A1200 power supplies; the power supply,
however, may be replaced at reasonable cost.
