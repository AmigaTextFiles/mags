I appologise that I didn't post about this a week or so ago when I went to
the Fishwrap site and found it was stomped on.  I've been having some major
difficulties with my newsfeed as of late.

Actually, I'm very surprised no-one else has posted about this matter until
now!

Not quite, what they did was tell these guys that they were not allowed to call
themselves Fishwrap anymore.

Here's the press release as it appeared in place of Almost Daily Fishwrap's
homepage a week or so ago:

The Almost Daily Fishwrap Gets Stomped by MIT

Dear Mr. Thompson:

     I am writing on behalf of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.  It has come to our attention that you are operating a news,
events and information website under the name "FISHWRAP."  M.I.T. owns the
U.S. federally registered trademark "FISHWRAP" for software and internet
news services.  Your use of the mark to label your website is an
infringement of M.I.T.'s rights in its trademark.
     Accordingly, M.I.T. requires that you immediately cease and desist
using "FISHWRAP" in any manner whatsoever, including, without limitation,
anywhere on or in your website and in the address of your website.  If no
action has been taken by October 3, 1997, M.I.T. will protect its rights to
the full extent of the law.

     M.I.T. appreciates your cooperation in this important matter.

          Sincerely,
          Karin K. Rivard
          Counsel

In short, what they are doing is telling them to change their name, and
remove all signs that they were EVER using the name Fishwrap.

The trouble with this, though, is that the lawyer who wrote the letter was
rather condescending about it, at least in her rather asinine concluding
line.

This rather brings to mind, though, something that happened quite a number
of years ago.  A certain big-name toy company came out with a new toy,
based on something a boy from Africa or some such place had been playing
with.  They put this thing out on the market, and it became rather popular
(still is, in fact).  So popular, in fact, that there came several
imitators, who used the same, trademarked name as the Big Company.  The
Big Company pounced on them and said, "Hey!  That's our trademarked name!
You can't use it!"  And the other company came back with "How can it be a
trademarked name when it's a word that's been in use for thousands of
years?"  They went to court over it, and Big Company quickly lost its
trademark.

The toy, BTW, was the yoyo.  The courts took one look at the facts, and
immediately rendered the trademark null and void:  It should never have
been issued to begin with.  It was only the ignorance of the trademark
office about the previous existence of the word yoyo that allowed them
to trademark it to begin with.

Now, if the Big Company had used the word yoyo as a trademarked name for,
say, a soft drink, or the name of a rock band, nothing would have been
amiss.  They would NOT, I repeat, NOT have been allowed to use it to stop
someone from using the word in the name of a toy.  They COULD have used
the trademark to stop someone else from calling a softdrink that, or a
rock band.

In the same way, Apple Computers cannot deny someone from using the word
apple in the name of a packaged fruit concoction.

This is the situation we have here:  Fishwrap is a more-or-less generic
word for newspaper.  It is in everyday slang.  Everyone calls their local
newspaper a fishwrap at least occasionally, and with some newspapers,
all the time!  :-)

MIT have every right to protect the trademarked name "Fishwrap," AS THE
NAME FOR A SOFTWARE PACKAGE!  But they do NOT, NOT, **NOT** have the right
to excusively use it as the name of a newspaper, electronic or otherwise.
And they do NOT, NOT, **NOT** have the right to stop someone else from
doing so, either.

Unfortunately, this is going to have to be taken to court before this
can be dealt with.  I somehow doubt the producer(s) of "Almost Daily
Fishwrap" have the money or the resources to do this, though.

On the other hand, if enough of us pitched in some money, he might have
a chance.  Hint, hint.  Nudge, nudge.
