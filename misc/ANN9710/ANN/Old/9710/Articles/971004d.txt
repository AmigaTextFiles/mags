Hi!

An update as to WarpOS: As WarpOS was for a long time handled a "secret" by 
Haage&Partner, and then suddenly released, i assumed, that the "secret" was 
because H&P had to clear up things with Phase 5. Especially i assumed, they 
now (as it was no longer a secret) cleared up things with Phase 5.

It seems the problem is not solved. Phase 5 (for what reasons i don't know) 
still do not like WarpOS. After my posting i was contacted by the coder of the 
original ppc.library (who did not like this posting also). I now asked him in 
the reply for some answers about his view of things... i hope i can clear up 
things, soon... i will talk tomorrow again with Mr. Haage, too. 

But, given the speed comparision of both software systems, i would not know 
what speaks against WarpOS. It is hardware-independent, BTW, so it will always 
run on future Amiga PPC Hardware, if this is now a PPC Board or something new 
from AT (like outlined on the Haage&Partner WWW Site).

Of course, as the coder of ppc.library outlined, it is not completely the 
fault of the software... 68k/PPC switch is a hardware problem, also. But 
appearently, it can be done much faster than ppc.library does it.

Well, i hope i will get as much info from Phase 5 like from Haage&Partner. I 
would like to remain a neutral view.

BTW, the coder of the ppc.library told some interesting news: There 
appearently will be a PPC Version of SAS/C as free upgrade !!!
