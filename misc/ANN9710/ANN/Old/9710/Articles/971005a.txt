Well, they were wrong in stating that the CPUs do not work in parallel.
But it is right that there is a delay when switching between the
processors. But why switch between the processors anyway? This is only
necessary when you use a linear code sequence (as it is generated by
Storm C) which executes some instructions on one CPU, then switches and
executes some instructions on the other CPU, and so on (which, BTW, will
result in one CPU waiting while the other one is executing
instructions). Instead of using this approach, we recommend to the
developers to build modules (which run as tasks), which are each
completely in 68k or PPC code. Then you use our fast and efficient
message system to communicate and exchange data between the different
tasks, which can typically be done in the microsecond time range. A task
running on one CPU can in this system continue to run after it sent a
message to another task on a different CPU. This is independent, BTW,
from the number of CPUs, the location of the CPUs (are they in the same
system? In the same house? In the same network?), if the CPUs have one
shared memory or if each CPU has an own physical memory pool, and
independent of the kind of CPUs (e.g. a 68k CPU, a PPC CPU, a dedicated
GL processor...)

Please revert to the attachment to my reply to your other posting in
this newsgroup also.

What you read was the promotional statement of H&P.  
 
In the posting I replied to, the author said that H&P indicated that
parallel operation would be difficult on the PowerUp. But that's not
true if you use an object oriented and elegant software concept as I
outlined above. As H&P have their Storm C which produces linear code
sequences  with mixed PPC/68k code, they probably waste lot of
performance and try to cure this by somehow making the context switch
faster. But these are efforts which go in the wrong direction.
