<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Cloanto Amiga Software Support on Internet and Aminet</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Cloanto has completed new Amiga software support sections on its web site (<A HREF="http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/">http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/</A>) and on Aminet (biz/cloan).

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Cloanto Web Workbench, which continues to surprise many users with its familiar look and feel, contains software, documentation and other support material for popular Cloanto packages like Personal Paint. The Cloanto web site is hosted on a fully redundant server with multiple T3 and T1 links to the Internet. This, combined with the carefully thought-out graphics, ensures smooth and fast connections to the site.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At the same time, Cloanto is proud to announce that Aminet, one of the world's largest and best-organized online archives of software, now hosts Cloanto software and support files in the "biz/cloan" directory. Through dozens of Aminet mirrors worldwide, and the Aminet CD-ROM editions, millions of users of Cloanto software will have better access to important and useful files such as:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Scripts and macros
<LI>Input/output modules
<LI>User interface language files
<LI>Fixes and enhancements to released versions
<LI>Demonstration versions of software
<LI>Artwork and sample screens
<LI>Developer documentation
<LI>User contributions
</UL>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Cloanto's Personal Paint 7 Breaks Amiga Chip RAM Barrier</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">With the release of the new CPU blitting module just made available on Aminet (biz/cloan/PBlit_68K.lha), Personal Paint 7 becomes the first Amiga program to actively exploit the full functionality of both the Graphics library and the Amiga blitter applied to bitmaps stored in Fast RAM.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Normally, two crucial parts of the Amiga system require bitmap data to be stored in Chip RAM: the original (Agnus) blitter chip, and the Graphics library. Personal Paint uses both, which until now meant that it had to store in Chip RAM at least the bitmaps currently being manipulated. Thanks to its modular design, Personal Paint 7 already implemented a "virtual blitter" which optionally used the CPU instead of the Agnus chip. The module just released extends this capability by implementing a faster 32-bit blitter (the Amiga blitter works in 16 bits).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The complete detachment from Chip RAM became possible when the developers of the famous CyberGraphX system completed the replacement of 100% of the original Amiga graphics.library with corresponding functions that can work on Fast RAM. This code is implemented in CyberGraphX version 40.100 and higher, which has just been released. After many sleepless nights of Cloanto's programmers, in cooperation with the CyberGraphX team, Personal Paint 7 becomes the first Amiga software to automatically detect and exploit this condition.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We would like to take this opportunity to praise the developers of CyberGraphX for achieving this difficult objective. CyberGraphX "clones", like earlier versions of the original CyberGraphX (and the original Amiga libraries), still require bitmaps to be in Chip RAM in order to be processed by certain functions of the Graphics library. (Personal Paint 7 is not "confused" by CyberGraphX clones that do not provide equivalent capabilities.)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The efforts of the CyberGraphX and Cloanto programmers have finally made a dream come true for many Amiga users who had plenty of Fast RAM but never enough Chip RAM.</P>
