Editor's Corner             by @{"Lori Vinciguerra" link P6}


Welcome back to school everyone.  I am hoping that over the summer, many of
you have figured out how to get on the World Wide Web.  It is very exciting
now that many schools are creating web pages.  Hopefully, Ralph's article
in the last issue of the AEL newsletter helped some of you get on the Web.
This issue includes an article about some web sites which may be of
interest to educators. If anyone else has a site to be mentioned, let me
know and I will include it in the next issue.

I have had several people interested in writing an article for the AEL
newsletter. However, there have been questions about what may be of general
interest to all of you.  If you have a suggestion for an article, let me
know.  I may be able to find someone to write about your topic. I think
that any article about what you are doing with your Amiga in the
educational field would be of interest.  I would encourage people to submit
an article for the next issue. The deadline for article submissions for the
next issue is December 1, 1996. As always, email your article to
owl@davinci.reading.ma.us or use U.S. mail to send to OWL Software, 460
Summer Ave., Reading, MA 01867-3819.

A one hour video tape which teaches young children how to create sculptures
from recycled newspapers and magazines. The technique is being promoted in
Quebec as a replacement for papermarcher. The only materials needed are
newspaper and rubber bands.  The first step one learns is how to create a
sculpted tree.

The tape was edited entirely on an amiga/toaster workstation and also includes
some artistic lightwave animations. At the moment it is only in French as it is
going into the elementary schools here in the province.

@node P3 "Java"

@toc "menu"
Java, Education and the Amiga  by @{"Ralph Vinciguerra" link P5}


What is Java?

The media has recently focused attention on Java, a new phenomenon in the
computing industry. Java is a combination of a new object-oriented
programming language and a supporting environment that makes programs
portable to nearly all computers without change. A quote from Sun
Microsystems, the parent of the Java effort, is "Write once, run anywhere".

The newest Web browsers, Netscape and Internet Explorer, currently contain
Java execution abilities. These browsers can now not only download and
display text (HTML), images (JPEG,GIF), and sound (AU), but they can also
download and execute small portable applications, known as "applets". This
provides a seamless extension to the Web browser without any detailed
intervention by the user.


Why is Java significant?

Java represents a shift in focus of the software industry. Software houses,
and individual programmers are loath to accept two past alternatives:
painstakingly port their software to each platform they can, or only write
for the most common platform. Users are also at a disadvantage, since they
are not free to select the personal computer that best matches their needs
and personal preferences. These past choices fail to fulfill the original
vision of the Personal Computer Revolution where people could enjoy
computers to explore, learn, and create wonderful things. Java changes all
this. I have written several Java programs, compiled them into a final
version, and run this single version on: 3 different UNIX operating systems
(Solaris,IRIX,Linux), Windows 95, Windows NT, and Macintosh. These programs
need no changes; a single version runs on these platforms and more. Why
isn't the Amiga on this list? Read on.

These portable Java programs can be transmitted over the Web to browsers,
pressed onto CD-ROM, distributed on floppy disks, or stored in databases or
in compound documents. Java also supports the creation of modular software
where smaller individual components can be mixed and matched to produce
personalized suites instead of monolithic feature-heavy single programs.
For example a small basic word processor can be combined with the spelling
checker of your choice. Add in a minimal spreadsheet that you prefer. These
small focused components can cooperate without supplying overlapping
functions. This is the future that the Java architecture offers.

To determine the impact Java is having, check trade magazines or attend
shows to find facts like these:

- All major operating system vendors (IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Sun, Silicon
Graphics, etc) have announced the intend to implement the Java environment
native to their systems.

- Major vendors have delivered significant Java-based products: Corel
(WordPerfect), Microsoft(Visual J++), Sun (JavaWorkShop), SGI(COSMO), etc.

- Major industry players have made significant commitments to convert their
internal operations to Java based solutions:  Dunn and Bradstreet, Fidelity
Investments, Sun Microsystems.


Why is Java critical to the Amiga?

Recent times have found the Amiga always in a time of critical decisions.
If it isn't the sparks and flames of a new owner, it's the lackluster
efforts by a current owner to advance the technology of the machine and its
operating system. The constant: the loyal Amiga users. Always ready to
stand up for a machine that was so far ahead of its time in architecture
that its remains to this day a competitive and cost effective platform if
properly upgraded.

One problem stands out, however. Although the Amiga has some of the best
productivity and creative applications, bar any platform, there are always
special applications written by small software houses that cannot afford to
port to unique markets like the Amiga. With Java, the development can be
done on any platform, and once the Amiga can run Java, it can run that
software unmodified.

Another key issue concerns VisCorp, almost the new owners of the Amiga
technology, and their Amiga-based "set top box". This device is one of the
new "convergent technology" devices, crossing lines between television,
telephony, web browsing, banking, and others. How can this device be
without a dominant solution like Java? Web browsing alone now presumes that
you can execute Java applets. How can the Amiga compete as even just a web
browsing solution without this critical ability?


How does Java relate to education?

Java is now being used at many colleges as the first programming language
being taught. This shift by educators away from older languages is due to
Java's clean object-oriented features. It also supports several programming
techniques that make programs easier to write and maintain, including the
elimination of dangerous memory management and manipulation techniques from
C and C++.

For users, Java offers the ability to combine education efforts across
multiple computers. A program can be written in Java and used on all the
computers in school regardless of kind. A strong community of Java
developers has formed on the Internet and many educational Java
applications can be downloaded from the Web. See the Gamelan site listed
below and navigate to the "Education" section.


How can we help?

I have been an avid Amiga enthusiast since near it's inception in 1985. I
will spare you the war stories from all those years. Basically, I still use
Amigas for nearly all my personal computing activities...until recently. I
have been using Java now for nearly a year and have found it to fill many
of my needs as a programmer and as a user. But for the first time in my
Amiga history, I cannot use my Amiga to explore, learn, or create in the
brave new Java world.

One effort is underway by valiant volunteers to port Java to the Amiga, but
without serious support I fear that the Amiga Java ability will be too
late. We need a strong commitment from VisCorp now, and a schedule for the
rollout of a Java implementation for the Amiga; initially as an add on, and
later an embedding into the Amiga operating system. The Amiga operating
system has some strong abilities that make it an ideal Java execution
platform: small, efficient, and flexible.

To learn more about Java, visit these Web sites:

     http://java.sun.com - Main Java support site

     http://www.gamelan.com - Large repository of Java programs and support

     http://www.javaworld.com - Online Java Magazine

     http://www.magnastar.com/javology/contents.html - Online Java Magazine

Or see your local technical bookstore for many new books on Java.

To help convince VisCorp to make Java part of the Amiga future, see their
web page for numerous e-mail contacts:

     http://www.vistv.com/

Specifically, you can also e-mail to: jcompton@xnet.com.

You can also volunteer to be part of the porting effort. They maintain a
Web page and mailing lists:

     http://www.sss.co.uk/~nt/hotjava.html


In Conclusion

There is so much I could describe about Java and it's future, but I would
be duplicating the fine efforts of others. The purpose of this article was
to persuade you to find out more about Java and to perhaps help guide
VisCorp to move more rapidly on their Java efforts. Since the Amiga cannot
yet support Java, many Amigans are unfamiliar with what it is and can do.
This brief introduction is just enough of a taste to guide you to further
exploration. I hesitate to suggest this, but find your way to a PC, Mac, or
UNIX computer and ask someone to help you try a Java enabled Web browser
and visit the Gamelan site. You will quickly learn how the Java activities
may well change the face of computers as we know them today.

@node P8 "The Amiga Web Directory"
@toc "menu"
The Amiga Web Directory by @{"Lori Vinciguerra" link P6}

Most of you "Amiga web surfers" already know about one of the most valuable
and popular web sites, The Amiga Web Directory.  The Amiga Web Directory
was created and is maintained by the Champaign-Urbana Computer Users Group.
This page holds links to almost all of the intersting Amiga sites on the
web. To visit the directory go to the URL http://www.cucug.org/.

Here you will find a list of Amiga companies which is close to supreseding
AC's Guide to the Amiga.  To view the list of companies go to the URL
http://www.cucug.org/amicommercial.html. Although the companies are not
sorted by type of software, you may use the search function to look for
keyword, such as education.  While I was cruising here, I found several
sites which may be of interest to educators.

    Amiga Radiologist at http://www.portal.com/~mikety/ is a home page
    written by a licensed radiologist. The products on this page were
    announced in a previous issue of the AEL newsletter.

    FairBrothers at http://www.fairbrothers.com/ is a developer of
    foreign language educational software.

    Lascelles Productions at http://mail.inhb.co.nz/lascelles/ is a
    New Zealand company which makes educational software for the Amiga.
    Product titles include: Connosseur Fine Arts Collection, Nimble
    Numbers, Clockworks, SnoWords, Word Construction Set, Look! Hear!,
    Kim, and Back to Basics.

    Opportunity With Learning at http://pages.prodigy.com/ralph/owl.htm
    has the product "Physics Laboratory in Mechanics" which is on sale
    now if you visit the web site.

    Simon's Home Page at http://www.sjacobs.demon.co.uk/ has two pieces
    of mathematical software.  Graph creates cartesian and polar
    coordinate graphs.  Matrix allows you to solve for the determinant,
    the inverse, and solve linear equations.

All of these sites were easily found from the Amiga Web Directory.

Looking around the rest of the web, I found a couple of other sites which
I thought may be of interest to you educators.  Apparently, the U.S.
Department of Education is hosting a gopher site which includes freeware
and shareware for Amigans to download.  You can find this site at:

    gopher://gopher.ed.gov:70/00/software/Amiga

I also found a couple more commercial vendors with Amiga products:

    The Digital Universe is an astronomy package which has received rave
    reviews.  The home page for this site is
    http://www.syz.com/DU/amiga.html.

    Europress Software has a whole line of educational products. Some
    of these are available for the Amiga. Check out their site at
    http://www.europress.co.uk.

As more and more sites are being put up, the Web will become an invaluable
place to find educational resources. So everyone ... start surfing.
