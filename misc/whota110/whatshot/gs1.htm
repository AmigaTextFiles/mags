Genetic Species, if not, why not? It is one of the best looking games coming our 
way at the moment. Sadly, it has suffered some delays recently, however, this is 
only so the authors can make it as good as possible.<P>

The most recent that most of you will have seen of this game is the version 3
demo that was distributed on the Amiga Format CD and has also been on Vulcan's
other CD releases.  This, however, is quite old now and there have been a
massive amount of additions since this was released.<P>

The game now features around 12 different weapons including a plasma rifle, a
flame thrower, an axe, a rocket launcher and the interestingly named drill
weapon to name just a few. you can be assured, there will be no lack of tools to
kill the enemy with.<P>

While on the subject of enemy characters, there is now a total of around
different enemies featured in the game. These range from the plain old corpses to
the weird looking huggers.<P>

The graphics engine has had a lot of work done on it, especially for specific
processors.  The game is running fast on just a reasonable Amiga
configuration now, and if you have a high powered Amiga you are in for an
excellent experience. The graphics engine boasts such things as texture
reflection/refraction, distance shading, shot lightsourcing and much more.<P>

Another aspect that has been improved on is the enemy AI.  This has received a
lot of work to make it as realistic as possible.  Things such as Retreat, Hide,
Roam and group fighting have been added to make the enemy as hard as possible 
to
beat, you won't find stupid enemies that just stand there waiting for you to kill
them in this game.<P>

Other things that has been implemented includes speech samples, introduction of
the probe takeover system, support for 3 button mice (There is joystick and
keyboard support too) and much more.<P>

Currently the game is looking like being released sometime on March although
this is yet to be confirmed.<P>
