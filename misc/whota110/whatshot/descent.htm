<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT></b>he first port of Descent has at last been 
released.  A very early version of the port was released on Aminet over the 
weekend.<P>

For those of you that do not know, Descent is a shoot-em-up set in a 3D world. 
It was a big success on the PC and later on the MAC, sadly no Amiga version was
ever done, until now...<P>

This release comes 2 weeks after the original source was released, a bit slower
then the 3 days for the Doom port, however, Descent is a much bigger task.<P>

As I said it is still very early days and the game isn't too fast at the moment.
I have heard reports of the game running at 9-17fps on an 060/CyberGFX eqiped
machine, however, this is something that will certainly improve.<P>

Currently to play the game you need quite a high spec Amiga.  On 040/060 with
FPU, 16Mb RAM and a CyberGraphics supporting graphics card is required.  On top
of this you will also require the commercial Descent data files.<P>

These requirments will get lower as the game gets more optimised, the author is
planning to make it playable on AGA/ECS systems and also reduce the processor
that is required.  Other things he plans to do includes adding sound and
networking support (This was taken out of the released sources) and porting of
the editor.<P>

Version 0.5 of the port can be downloaded by clicking the link below:-<P>
