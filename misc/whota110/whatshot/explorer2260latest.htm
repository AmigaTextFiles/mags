The following are a couple of pictures of a ship which will be appearing in the intro 
to Explorer2260.  At the moment, there are no screenshots of the game engine 
until it is being coded, and they are having to wait on the PPC boards to arrive.  
But work is continuing on the station systems in Explorer2260 and on implementing 
AHI and CD support for both games.
