Hi,
<p>
This issue, enough that it contains quite a few articles, most of the articles are on 
upcoming Amiga shows such as <A HREF="woa.htm">World Of Amiga 
1998</A>, <A HREF="sacc.htm">Amiwest</A> and  <A 
HREF="amiga982.htm">Amiga98</A>.  But, two of the biggest articles in this 
issue have to be <A HREF="kruse.htm">Version 3.0 of the Popular Amiga TCP/IP 
Stack Now Available</A>, which appeared just before I finished this editorial and 
<A HREF="phase5.htm">Index Information Ltd, Blittersoft and Phase 
5 Digital Products Announce Cooperation On PowerPC Technology for the 
Amiga</A> which will be of great interest to many Amiga owners out there.
<p>
The <A HREF="survey1.htm">survey</A>, which in fact is two surveys is as 
promised in this issue and is ready for you to fill in.  These surveys will be present 
in the next couple of issues of whota and will also be available at the web site.
<p>
Check out this issue's <A HREF="nib.htm"> News In Brief</A>, which in this 
issue is dominated mainly by little bits and pieces of games news along with the 
latest on the Amiga RC5 Team Effort.
<p>
On the games front, there are a few articles, but the biggest of the whole 
lot have to be <A HREF="gs1.htm">Genetic Species Update</A>, <A 
HREF="descent.htm">First Descent Port Released</A> & <A 
HREF="doom1.htm">Amiga Doom Update</A> articles.
<p>
If you're interested in what's been happening with Amiga Report of late, why not 
check out <A HREF="ar.htm">Amiga Report Update From Jason 
Compton</A>. 
<p>
This issue's exclusive article is on <A HREF="explorer2260latest.htm">Latest On 
Explorer2260</A>.
<p>
What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine can still be found on the web, at: <p> <A 
HREF="http://www.sonic.net/~alanwall/whota/index.html">http://www.sonic.net/~al
anwall/whota/index.html</A>. 
<p>
Now this month's, Site Of The Month is <A 
HREF="http://www.nutts.demon.co.uk/">The Amiga 
Nutta</A>, which has been mentioned in a number of previous articles 
in What's Hot.  The site is well worth a look to keep up with all the latest Amiga 
games news along with release schedules for all upcoming Amiga games amongst 
other games related stuff.  
<P>
The Links section has been cleaned up and so check out <A 
HREF="links.htm">Links</A> for the latest additions to my Links Section.
