<P><A HREF="http://www.asimware.com/">Asimware</A> is proud to 
announce today's release of MasterISO v2.0; our next
generation CD-R/RW writing software program.

<P>Building upon our years of experience in CD-ROM and CD-R software with
AsimCDFS and MasterISO v1, we have re-designed MasterISO v2.0 from the
ground up to provide an extremely stable CD-R/RW writing program.
MasterISO v2.0 represents the input of hundreds of our users in both the
design and testing phases.  MasterISO v2.0 includes the features users have
requested, organized in a logical and easy-to-use fashion.

<P>New features in MasterISO include:
<ul>
<li> Disc-At-Once writing;
<li> CD to CD-R/RW copying;
<li> Full File Manager for editing directory structures;
<li> On-the-fly writing from hard drive to CD-R/RW;
<li> Rock Ridge and Joliet file system support;
<li> Incremental multisession;
<li> Jukebox support for the Elms DVL (optional);
<li> Firmware update functionality for selected CD-R/RW drives.
</ul>

<P>MasterISO v2.0 comes with a comprehensive 228 page printed manual.  This
provides an invaluable reference and guide for both the novice and expert
user alike.

<P>MasterISO's graphical user interface is completely font-sensitive,
supports Amiga screen modes and utilizes alternate language
translations.  German and Italian language files are standard.

<P>Along with the features and power of MasterISO, we are equally pleased to
announce our new suggested retail price of $89.00 (US$), or $119.00
(Canadian$).  MasterISO is an affordable addition to your CD-R/RW drive.

<P>We believe that MasterISO represents the future of CD-R/RW mastering
software for the Amiga platform.  But don't take our word for it - <A
