FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<P>24 February 1998


<P>The Transitional Steering Committee (TSC) of the ICOA is
pleased to announce that it is finally open to accepting
membership applications from those who feel that they can
help advance the technical future of the Amiga, whether commercial,
individual, Public Domain, Shareware or Academic.

<P>Please peruse the <A HREF="http://www.netreach.net/~fleecy/icoa/">ICOA 
temporary website</a>, read the by-laws and
membership sections and then move to the resources section if
an application is to be made.

<P>Please note at this time that affiliate membership applications
are not being taken. This will be developed and put into effect
once a new Steering Committee has been elected.

<P>We are hoping to turn around membership applications within seven
days.

<P>At the same time, we also wish to announce that the ICOA publicly
available developer and product database is also available. We
invite all developers to register both themselves and their
products on the database. We hope that this register will become
a central point of information for users seeking information
about products and their status.

<P>Those registering are under no obligation to join the ICOA.

<P>There will be a an annual membership fee for joining the
ICOA but this will not be charged until the financial system
is in place. Once this is done, the Steering Committee will
announce a cutoff date for subscriptions to be paid. At this time,
any who do not wish to pay the subscription will be free to rescind
their membership and will be under no further obligation. We
estimate that this system will not be available for 2-3 months.

<P>Once we have 100 members, the election procedure for the new
Steering Committee will be put into operation.

<P>We wish to thank all those who have supported and stuck with the
ICOA and who have allowed it to get to this point. For those
who have doubted or merely watched, we invite them to come and
join.

<P>The ICOA is a co-operative body of developers run by developers for
the benefit of developers, all developers, to enable them to
further the Amiga platform for the benefit of the whole community,
developers, owners and users.

<P>All for the Amiga and the Amiga for all!
