<CENTER><H2>Amiga Full Steam Ahead In DES II 
Challenge</H2></CENTER>
<P>
PRESS RELEASE

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE <br>
February 15th 1998


<P>The Amiga RC5 Team continues to make headway in the row of RSA
Secret Key challenges, by participating in the Bovine Monarch/DES II
challenge, now with the release of hybrid clients for participation in
both the DES II and RC5-64 efforts. To prove the Amiga is both alive
and viable, the clients come in 68k and PowerPC versions, the latter
being one of the fastest amongst all platforms, reaching an amazing
performance of almost 1 Megakey per second using the Motorola PowerPC
604e at a clock speed of 200 MHz.

<P>These new levels of performance and cooperation have been reached
thanks to Stefan Smietanowski's programming efforts and Steve
Krueger's dedication to improving the SAS/C compiler for PowerPC
equipped Amigas.

<P>Since the DES II challenge is well ahead, we invite all Amiga fans
with or without PowerPC accelerators to join us now and improve our
ranking, perhaps find the key and win a part of the US$ 5000 award
money.

<P>The Amiga RC5 Team effort is also providing a mailing list as a
forum for the discussion on above topics and the effort in general.

<P>For additional info on how to participate and more in depth
explanation, please visit the Amiga RC5 Team effort homepage at:

<CENTER><H2>Myst 1.1 Released</H2></CENTER>
<p>
The update to Myst has been released by ClickBOOM.<P>
The original release was slightly let-down by a few small bugs, these have now
been rectified by this patch.  So any of you out there who were worried about
purchasing it for these reasons have no excuse not to buy it now.<P>

Most of the problems that occurred were in the CyberGFX version, however there
were also some crashes/corruptions that appeared in both versions, all that were
found have been fixed.<P>

There have also been a few additions to the game including a ClickBOOM
animation for the CyberGFX version and a prompt intro skipping option.<P>

I suggest that all you people out there buy Myst as it really is a great game,
if your still unsure about buying it, read my review which will be up soon
:).<P>

The Myst patch can be downloaded by clicking on the link below:-<P>

You may not have heard much about this game, it is a Command & Conquer 
games
in development by Desktop Corruption (The same people behinf Dafel: Bloodline). 
Anyway, I was due to be bringing you news on it a while ago, however, there were
problems with the coder of the game.  This has now been sorted so look out for
news regarding the game soon.<P>

<p>
You may remember this from a feature I done on it a while ago.  For those that
do not know, it is a Civilization clone, with a major difference, it can be
played online.  Anyway, there has been a new demo of it released recently and it
is looking very good.  To find out more about the game and to download the 
demo
go to there webpage at:- <A

<p>
This is a game that has already been released by APC&TCP and will soon be
released by Islona in the UK.  It is a Bomberman type game, as for if it reaches
the heights that BlitzBombers has - we'll have to wait and see.

<P>
The DES II challenge is over!  After 41 days and somewhere between 85-90% of 
the keyspace checked the right key has been found by a person/team wishing to 
remain anonymous. The Amiga RC5 Team completed almost 1 million DES blocks 
and reached an overall ranking of 14<SUP>th</SUP> (out of something like 
20000 individual teams) with top keyrates around 270 Mkeys/s. A heartfelt 
applause to Stefan and everyone else supporting the effort. Final statistics for DES 
II-1 (as it's now officially called, since in about 4 months time the next RSA 
challenge will probably be 'DES II-2') will be available shortly.<P>We now return 
to RC5-64 (stats will be available when backlog clears) and work continues on the 
third generation of clients allowing other challenges on a 'plug-in' basis.<P>Please 
delete your DES buffers now and change your settings to do RC5-64 again! 
Although the latest clients will automatically switch to RC5-64 when they connect to 
the proxy, they <I>will</I> do DES if you stop and run them without settings 
changed (as long as you have any DES blocks left anyway).
