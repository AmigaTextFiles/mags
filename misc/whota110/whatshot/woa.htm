<font size="+2">A</font>fter quite a bit of confusion, we can assure you all 
that the WOA '98
show will indeed be taking place.
<p>
<font size="+2">T</font>he date has been set for the 15th-17th May at the 
Novotel in London.
Already the show is shaping up to be an unmissably exciting event, with
some of the most interesting developments for years planned. 
<p>
<font size="+2">W</font>e can expect to see some of the most eagerly 
awaited developments of the
last few years turning up, including the BoXeR from Index Information, the
A5000 from Power Computing / DCE, the PowerUp cards from phase 5 and the
latest developments from HiQ's Siamese. There are plans for some big
giveaway competitions, and a multi player Quake competition is on the
cards.
<p>
<font size="+2">T</font>here will be a devcon as part of the schedule of 
events, where it is hoped
that Amiga Inc will be revealing some of the core developments of OS3.5 to the
public for the first time. There are also plenty of surprises yet
announced!
<p>
<font size="+2">T</font>he organisers of the World of Amiga show, reacting 
to criticisms last year
that the show clashed with the football, are planning a special World of
Amiga cup final suite where visitors to the show on the Saturday can view
the match live on a large screen while eating realistic meat pies and
drinking beer in the company of fellow Amiga owning football fans.
<p>
<font size="+2">T</font>his one is going to be a real big one, so keep a 
space in your diaries for
mid May. WOA '98 will be the show that tells the UK that the boing is back!
We will publish further information on the World of Amiga show as soon as
we can, so be patient.
<p>
<font size="+2">I</font>n the meantime, trade inquiries and parties interested 
in exhibiting can
email <a href="mailto:woa@cu-amiga.co.uk">woa@cu-amiga.co.uk</a> for 
further
information. Please don't mail to this address if you just want attendance
information, it will be publically announced as soon as it is available.
