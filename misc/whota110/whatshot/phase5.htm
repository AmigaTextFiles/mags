Announce Cooperation On PowerPC Technology for the Amiga</H2></CENTER>
<P>
February 09, 1998: <A HREF="http://www.cix.co.uk/~index/welcome.htm">Index 
Information Ltd.</a>, a UK developer and
manufacturer of Amiga-based computer products, <A 
HREF="http://www.blittersoft.com/">Blittersoft</a>, a UK based
Amiga distributor, and <A HREF="http://www.phase5.de/">phase 5 digital 
products</a>, a German developer
and manufacturer of Amiga upgrade products, are pleased to announce
their co-operation on PowerPC technologies for the upcoming
Amiga-compatible BoXeR system by Index Information Ltd/Blittersoft

<P>As a result of this co-operation, the BoXeR system will be shipping
with a PowerPC expansion slot, on which a PowerPC-based accelerator
can be installed, which will be fully software compatible to the
PowerUP accelerators from phase 5 digital products. "We are pleased
that our co-operation will further support the migration of the Amiga
towards the PowerPC, and that we can provide a unified interface for
software developers and for the users. By use of a compatible API
(Application Programmers Interface) it ensures that software developed
for PowerUP will work on the PowerPC accelerators for the BoXeR,
making it even more attractive for Amiga software vendors to support
this standard. This co-operation helps strengthen an emerging standard
which will allow a wide range of breathtaking new products." says Wolf
Dietrich of phase 5 digital products. He points out that the PowerUP
technology which will be used in the PowerPC accelerators for the
BoXeR is the base for a new generation of high-tech products, such as
CPU cards with multiple PowerPC processor and full multiprocessing
software support, which will be appearing later in 1998.

<P>Additionally, the BoXeR will also incorporate a graphics card expansion
slot which is compatible with the one that is available on phase 5's
CyberstormPPC and MkIII accelerators. This will allow the availability
of powerful and inexpensive high-resolution 3D graphics card for the
BoXeR, too. "By jointly choosing a common performance level for the next
generation of GFX cards, together we can set a unified minimum standard
which software developers can rely on" adds Wolf Dietrich. "This will
quickly increase the number of applications using highest resolution and
the hardware 3D acceleration, including quite a number of fascinating
new games."


<P>Also closely involved in the co-operation is Blittersoft, the
worldwide distributor of the BoXeR system.  "Whilst the BoXeR is very
much a product to provide a diverse range of Amiga systems, we feel it
is important to maintain compatibility with the leading edge
peripherals.  phase 5 products are very much in that category, and we
hope this co-operation will be the first of many, to allow the Amiga
community to receive the BoXeR design with even more confidence" says
Paul Lesurf of Blittersoft.

<P>"We are very pleased to announce the ongoing work to increase the
flexibility of the BoXeR and the work with phase 5 will allow us to
deliver a wider range of performance options to the customer", said
Mick Tinker of Index.  "BoXeR systems will be available with
performance starting at the 68040 25MHz, through all the speed options
up to the 68060 66MHz and on to single and multiprocessor PowerPC
systems with enormous performance levels. All this will be available
at time of purchase or as user upgrades.  The modern design of the
BoXeR motherboard will allow the full benefit of the PowerPC to be
utilised by providing a 64-bit path to onboard memory."
