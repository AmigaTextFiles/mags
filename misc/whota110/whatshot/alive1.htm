For full details on what has happen to Alive MediaSoft, read the Press Release 
below.

<center><b>Alive Mediasoft Ltd And Software Publishing</b></center>
<p>

All of you know that Alive Mediasoft Ltd has obtained great respect in the Amiga 
market in the eight months of trading. Not only from the Amiga user of which 
Alive have as customers, but also from the other companies within the Amiga scene.
<br>
<br>
Within these eight months Alive has grown at an astonishing rate.  Our customer 
database is in its thousands, and the amount of potential game developers 
approaching Alive Mediasoft Ltd with an aspiration of seeing their hard work 
becoming a commercial game has increased.
<br>
<br>
Due to this success Alive Mediasoft Ltd have been placed at a junction in the road 
of its evolution. This juction puts a question before the four directors of Alive 
Mediasoft.
<br>
<br>
<center><b>This Question Was;</b></center>
<p>
Does Alive Mediasoft Ltd expand and concentrate on acheiving to be the best mail 
order company in the Amiga community or does it expand and become purely a 
publishing house?
<br>
<br>
<center><b>The Answer;</b></center>
<p>
This question was given serious thought by all concerned for a great deal of
time, and the following is our answer.
<br>
<br>
It was decided that the Amiga market does not have the kind of Mail order 
company that Alive has become, with its freindly service & staff that really know 
about the Amiga and the games that they sell.
<br>
<br>
Alive was the first to offer a Classic Game search facility, others soon followed suit.
<br>
<br>
Infact the Amiga market doesn't have a dedicated mail order company since the
sad loss of Premier Mail order.
<br>
<br>
It was therefore decided that at this point in time Alive Mediasoft Ltd will
concentrate on being a Mail Order company.
<br>
<br>
<center><b>Oh No What About The Games Publishing?</b></center>
<p>
Due to the decision explained above, the publishing part of Alive Mediasoft
Ltd, myself and team, will be leaving Alive Mediasoft Ltd to become a
dedicated publishing house under a different name.
<br>
<br><center>
CRYSTAL SOFTWARE
</center>
<br>
This new company will be a seperate entity from Alive Mediasoft Ltd.
<br>
<br>
<center><b>What About The Forthcoming Games?</b></center>
<p>
All the future releases from Alive Mediasoft Ltd, will now be published and
released by my new company.
<br>
<br>
This includes Gilbert Goodmate, Tank Goblins, Arcangel, plus two new titles in
early development.
<br>
<br>
It also includes, soon to be anounced, PC licenced conversions.
<br>
<br>
<center><b>Other Information</b></center>
<p>
I would like to make clear that this split from Alive Mediasoft Ltd is to allow both 
parties involved to become the best in what they want to acheive, and is no way 
contrary to any rumours that may be generated after this split is made public.
<br>
<br>
I would like to think that you will continue to give me the level of support you 
have given me when I was part of Alive Mediasoft Ltd. As I will continue to aspire 
to bring new and great titles to the Amiga platform of computers.
<br>
<br>
Obviously the change over is not an easy thing, and therefore some time will
be needed to get things up and running.  This time will be to relocate to new 
premises, administration work, and to change the e-mail addresses and Web site.
<br>
<br>
Therefore CRYSTAL SOFTWARE will be operating fully from 3rd March 1998.
<br>
<br>
I can still be contacted at this e-mail address or +44 (0)1992 718990 untill
28th February 1998.
