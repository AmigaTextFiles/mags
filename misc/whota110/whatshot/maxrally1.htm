Rally is 
a multi-player overhead racing game under development by newcomers Fortress 
who plan to develop games for the Amiga.
<br>
<br>
Their first title Max Rally works on all Amiga's with at least 1.5 MB of memory and 
involves up to four players participating in different types of racing against each 
other, against the clock or up against intelligent computer controlled cars.
<br>
<br>
<img src=images/maxr04.jpg alt="" WIDTH=159 HEIGHT=124 align=right>In 
Max 
Rally you get to choose your own driving character with 6 characters to pick from 
with each driver having their own unique driving attributes.
<br>
<br>
The game offers many different challenges for you to try out such as the 
Championship where you face up to three computer controlled cars on 20 different 
tracks which include various terrains such as Woodland, Cosmic, Snow and Sand.  
It's up to you to come out top but it won't be easy as you have to come out top of 
all 20 tracks and if you fail on one track you have to replay it - the next problem is 
that you only have 5 continues.
<br>
<br>
<img src=images/maxr02.jpg alt="" WIDTH=159 HEIGHT=124 align=left>If 
you 
complete that you can go on to the Max Rally Challenge where in addition to 
completing the 20 tracks, you have five Max Rally Challenge tracks that must be 
completed.  These are totally original and unique styles of racing set on the Cosmic 
terrain but according the developers you'll have to find more out about that 
ourselves.
<br>
<br>
There is also a multiple player mode for you to play against up to four of your 
friends either through one Amiga or through two Amiga's if you have a null-
modem cable.  There is also a Time Trials section which allows to to play against 
the clock to beat other people's lap records on tracks.  Other players can also join 
in where you will have to beat each others fastest lap times.  There are many other 
features but I won't tell you everything yet but you can expect a rolling demo of 
Max Rally to be released soon.
