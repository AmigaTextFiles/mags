<P><b>About Aural Synthetica:</b><br>
Aural Synthetica is a software sound creation program based around the
modular synthesizers popular in the
1960's.  A modular synthesizer works in any way you want it to, it is
limited only by your imagination.

<P>Aural Synthetica being based in software brings the benefits of digital
technology without losing the analogue
functions you would expect. You can create your own waveforms and morph
between them if you wish, you can also
make use of logic functions and bandwidth controls. Best of all Aural
Synthetica does not go out of tune - unless
that is you want it to. Aural Synthetica can do one thing that was
impossible on modular systems - you can save
your setup and reload it at any time.

<P>Aural Synthetica is a very complex program but to make life easier there
are preset "Basic Synthesizer" setups
built into the program, these are comprised of a number of pre-connected
modules and you are free to change the
settings as much as you wish.

<P>Aural Synthetica renders samples at CD quality and these can then be
saved in the following formats:
IFF, AIFF, WAV, MAUD and SAFF.
