<B><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT></B>t's been a week or two since I brought 
you any news on
the state of the Doom ports. Well, since then a lot has been
happening.</B><P>

<IMG SRC="images/doom2.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT">

There are now 7 different ports in active development, of which two are for PPC
machines.  All of these are moving along very well and are not only giving all
of the features of the orginal Doom game to Amiga owners but also adding new
features which haven't been seen before.<P>

Out of the seven ports that are available now the most popular is ADoom.  This
along with DoomAttack has the fastest 68k engine, it also contains the unqiue
features of being also to play the game on a higher screenmode.  While all the
other ports and the original Lunix source only allow play in a 320x200, ADoom
allows you to play the game in resolutions upto 1600x1280, this looks absolutely
brilliant but is slow even on an 060.<P>

Most of the ports are now at such a stage of optimisation that they are easily
playable, full screen on a basic 030/50MHz.  Some of the higher ADoom
resolutions are also playable on this spec machine allthough at least a 040 is
recommended.<P>

Since Doom is alomst virtually made up from something called a WAD file, there
have been many commercial and PD WADS created.  All of the Doom ports allow 
you
to use these.  The Doom2, Final Doom and Ultimate Doom WADS are all reported 
to
work, as are many of the free WADS that are available on the Internet.  This
virtually gives you a number of different games in one.<P>

Below is a quick run-down of each Doom port, to decide which is best for you it
really would be best to try all of them.<P>

This was the first Doom port to appear.  The early bugs that were in the port to
start off with have been removed and it is now looking very good.  However,
it unfortunalty requires ix-emul and RTGMaster to run.<P>

<B>ADoom</B><P>

This is, in my opinion, the best of the lot at the moment.  It one of, if not
the fastest port available (Maybe just bettered by DoomAttack).  It allows you
to use both low and high detail modes, fully supports music and also allows you
to choose the resolution that you run the game in.  As of the latest version it
also supports DeHackEd files.<P>

This was the fourth of the ports to appear and is progressing along nicely, I
haven't given this one much of a look myself, however, I'm told it runs quite
nicely.<P>

<B>PsiDoom</B><P>

This port only appeared quite recently.  It's still pretty basic as features
supported goes, it doesn't support music and doesn't allow play via joystick or
mouse.<P>

<B>DoomAttack</B><P>

This is probably the fastest port currently available on an 030.  A very nice
feature of this port is that it contains a nice prefs program that allows you to
configure the game without having to result to long cli arguments.<P>

The other two ports (ZhaDoomPPC and VDoomPPC) are for PPC machines only and
since I haven't got a PPC, I haven't been able to test these, however, I'm told
they are very fast.<P>

There has been a WWW site set-up that not only contains all of the ports
currently available but also all of the files that are needed to run them.  It
is updated daily with news versions being put on there as soon as they are
released.  You can access this site by clicking the link below:- <P>
