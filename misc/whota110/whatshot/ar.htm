<b>Amiga Report Delays</b>

<P>First off, no, <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/ar/ar.html">Amiga Report</a> has not been 
cancelled.  We still have all of
our Amiga equipment and the same dedication to producing the world's
longest running online Amiga publication.

<P>The problem as of late has been that the equipment and our schedules have
not been compatible with this goal.

<P>Shortly before Christmas, in an accident of bizarre proportions, the main
Amiga Report 4000T was damaged and put out of commission.  It took over 6
weeks to get the problem fixed--which wound up being a fairly simple
damaged cable.

<P>Since recovering the 4000T, available time to write and produce Amiga
Report has unfortunately been scarce.  Both Assistant Editor Katherine
Nelson and I have been extremely busy.  The bad news is that until about
mid-June, my time will be pulled in a number of very important and
time-consuming directions.

<P>So, here's the bottom line.

<P>Amiga Report will continue to be produced into the forseeable future.

<P>I can't guarantee when our first issue of 1998 will be released.  The best
guess I can give at this point is "March."

<P>I also can't guarantee when 6.02 will follow.  April is somewhat unlikely.
Late May-early June is more likely.

<P>Despite the trend there's no conscious effort to pull back on AR's
production--and no, this isn't due to our move to HTML.  We don't -want-
AR to be quarterly--we never consciously wanted it to be bimonthly, or
monthly even--but at times over the past couple years that has been the
only way to make it work, so that is how it has worked.

<P>Thank you all for your patience.  You can stop sending me panic-stricken
e-mail now. :)
