    Welcome to AmyNews Workshop 1 (AmyNews 19)
    

    This workshop's issue:
    
    Tutorial for PhotoGenics Compose function.
    
    
    This is a guide written with new users of PhotoGenics in mind but
    it can also be useful for those who hasn't tried compose yet.

    It explains the use of PhotoGenics Compose function, used to
    'Compose' pictures... This will be easier to understand if you
    check out the pic "mix.jpg" included in this archive...

    @{u}The Files:@{uu}

    Info.Doc    - You are reading it...
    pic1.jpg    - First example pic, Rico Holmes Pumaliza.
    pic2.jpg    - Second example pic, unknown painter/scanner...
    Step.1      - First step-by-step pic.
    Step.2      - Second step-by-step pic.
    Step.3      - Third step-by-step pic.
    Step.4      - Fourth step-by-step pic.
    mix.jpg     - A example of two pictures "Composed" into one.

    The strange comments on the JPEG pictures are palettes for FastView.

    * You need an AGA amiga, becouse the step-by-step pictures are in HAM8.
    * You need the PhotoGenics pack.
    * 2-4 megs is required, but 6 is recommended...
    
    The result with 640*400/512 pictures are MUCH better, so if you have
    the memory, get some nice pics and start composing. This works fine 
    with 6 megs...

@node "STEP.1" "STEP 1"

    Load Photgenics and open examplepictures. Now position the two 
    pictures as shown in the step-by-step picture

    Now move the fingernail pic of "pic1.jpg" in the "Images" window to
    the box labelled "Second" in the same window.

    Now activate the window containing the pic "pic2.jpg".
    Step 1 is now completed and your Photogenics screen should look
    just like the step-by-step pic "Step.1"
    
    View picture   @{" STEP 1 " system "VT Steps/Step.1"} 
        
    Go to the next @{" STEP   " link "STEP.2" 0}
@endnode

@node "STEP.2" "STEP 2"

    Choose "Compose" in the "Image" menu.

    Now, Press "Blend In/Out" in the window that you just opened.

    Step 2 is now complete and your pic should now look like "Step.2"

    Go to the next @{" STEP   " link "STEP.3" 0}

@node "STEP.3" "STEP 3"

    Activate "pic2.jpg" if it's not already, and choose "Restore Aspect"
    from the "Options" menu.

    Choose "Clear Paint Layer" in the "Alpha/Paint Layer" menu. This is
    is the same as using the button that looks like a empty box in
    the toolbox window.

    Choose "Brush Settings" in the "Brush" menu to bring up the
    Settings window. There is also a button for this as you probably
    know. Set the gauges to the values used in "Step.3" pic...
    The pressure value can be changed, but do not use a too high value...

    Now go on with step 4!

@node "STEP.4" "STEP 4"

    As you can see in "Step.4", "pic1.jpg" is now "composed" with
    "pic2.jpg". This is simply done by painting as normal, but the
    "color" will be the Secondary pic. As with normal painting, you can
    use right mousebutton to "undo" your paint...
    When you get the result you want, just save the pic as normal.

    This function is very powerful, and can be used to super-inpose
    logos and similar into 24-bit pictures.
    
    The best result is achived by rendering the JPEG pic in either
    ImageFX or FastView(ShareWare).
