Templates

You've all seen those cryptic command templates when you type a ? after
a command in the CLI haven't you? Things that look like this:

DIR/M,P=PAT/K,KEYS/S,DATES/S,NODATES/S,TO/K,SUB/K,SINCE/K,UPTO/K,QUICK/S,
BLOCK/S,NOHEAD/S,FILES/S,DIRS/S,LFORMAT/K,ALL/S:

We all know what I'm talking about? No? Ok, If you don't know how to
use a specific command from the Amiga CLI, then you can type the command
followed by a ? and theoretically, the garbage produced will help you
to understand the command. This is not always the case, and you need to
know what you're looking at when you encounter these templates.

We'll go through the one above because it includes most of the things
I want to look at. First, you need to know some things about the
sytax of these templates.

SWITHCES
A Switch is something which is on or off, right? That's true in Amiga
DOS aswell. It's basically a parameter which, if you type it in after
the command, then it's on, and if you choose to omit it, then it's
off. For instance you could type List Libs: DATES. The DATES is a
switch, and is on, because I've typed it in. However, List Libs:
has the date switch turned off.

As you probably know, Commands have arguments (or parameters) after
them. These parameters can also have their own parameters, and they
are all specified in a different way, and the way they should be
specified when using the command.

This method of telling you how to use parameters is shown after a
'/' character which you can see in the command template above. Each
parameter is optional, and parameters are seperated by commas.

/M after a parameters indicates that you should type a file or
directory. For instance, the list command:

List DIR/M
List Libs:

/K want to to type in a string. For instance, in the list command:

List P=PAT/K
List P=#?.library

Whenever there's an equals sign, you need to keep that part in your
parameter as shown above.

/S signifies a switch, and we've already been through that.

/N want you to type in a number, it's like /K, but the command only
accepts numbers.

That's basically it. There will be more of these somewhere, but that's
the basics, and if anyone's got a clearer way of explaining it,
send it to me :)
