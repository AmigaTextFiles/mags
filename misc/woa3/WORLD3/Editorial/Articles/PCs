PCs

I've got a PC. A shamefull admittance, i know, but it's true. And before
I got it, I was all excited that I would be able to get on the internet.
I was all excited and never stopped using it for a couple of weeks, but
now I want rid of it. It's a bag of crap!

For a time, I thought it might even take over my Amiga, but I don't
think there's any danger of that happening now. People seem to be buying
PC's left right and centre, however, a true Amigan might buy a PC
but would never stick with it. And I'd prefer to get rid of it if
at all possible.

It wouldn't be so bad if everyone didn't claim that Windows was so good
when it's not! It's MUCH slower than AmigaOS in launching of tasks,
loading, etc. Constantly asking you to do things when you don't want
to do them, even when you've said no more than once!

It's very annoying, and if another person ever comes up to me and says
Windows is better than AmigaOS, I swear I'll kill them. Seriously.
