WOA Collection Volume 1

We are preparing a very special version of WOA for all you fans out there
where we'll be compiling the best of each of the past 3 issues into one
collection for you to read and treasure forever :)

These will be released on to Aminet and probably end up on the Amiga
Format CD in the Readerstuff directory. And here's a question for you
to answer for us...

How many issues should there be between Collection editions?

   3
   4
   5
   More?

Enjoy the first collection which should be released soon on to our
website and to the places mentioned above.
