Something very special...

We are scheduled to have an issue in June, which is coincidental because
that's the Amiga's 14th birthday month. And as such, we will be replacing
issue 4 with WOASpecial Issue 1. It'll be released, pretty much in the
same way all the issues are released, and on the traditional WOA Release
date (14th).

So, what'll be in it? Well, were currently in negotiations with various
people so we can get some extra special articles (A certain Mr. Schindler
at Amiga Inc is also involved with this article frenzy). We'll hopefully
have some of your own contrbutions for a change (never seem to get any)
and we're hoping it will be one of the best issues (circulationwise)
we've ever produced.

Below are the release dates for our upcoming issues

WOA Special Issue 1 Released: 14/6/99
        Issue 4 Release Date: 14/8/99

That'll keep you occupied for quite some time :)
