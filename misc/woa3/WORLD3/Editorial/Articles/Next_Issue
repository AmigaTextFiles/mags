Next Issue

We've got a bit of a change afoot in WOA. Issue 4 won't be released
for a whole 4 months! However, don't worry because all that time will
be filled with our Amiga birthday special released where Issue 4
would normally have been released.

So, we don't really know what'll be in issue 4 because it's just too
far ahead to predict. One things for sure, it'll have at least 3
interviews with famous Amigans, and various things which you all know
and love such as Tutorials, Features and all the other stuff.

Issue 4 Released: 14th August 1999
Special Issue 1:  14th June 1999
Issue 5 Released: 14th October 1999
