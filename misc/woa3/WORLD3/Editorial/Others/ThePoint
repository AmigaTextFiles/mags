The Point Takeover

Trogladite Software has recently launched a takeover bid of the excellent
'The Point' diskmag. Established in 1992, it is probably one of the
longest running Amiga diskmags. As of issue 54, Trogladite Software
will be the proud owners of two Amiga diskmags. One which has a devoted
following from over 8 years ago, and another which has just found that
it can reach over 360 readers!

However, I can only do one diskmag, and as such, I need people who will
write in The Point and keep it going as it was when the old team owned
it. Note that I will be doing issue 54, while people who apply will be
taking over from issue 55.

The mag will still be owned by Trogladite Software
