Send us your stuff

Since we've had no articles submissions since we started, I'd like you
to start sending some soon :) Especially with our special edition
coming up in June to celebrate the Amiga's 14th birthday, we need all
the help you can provide.

The ideal situation would be every single one of our 360+ registered
readers sending in an article, that way, it really would be a packed
issue, but I don't suppose that will happen, so we'll have to do with
me, Sam, and some of your own articles.

Anyway, this whole article is about contributing in gerenal. We'd like
you to send us stuff for any issue, not just for the special issue,
but there are two seperate Email addresses for the two different
issues. For general contributions which can go in any issue, send to
woa@trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk and for contributions for the special
edition, send to woa14@trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk

The following doesn't apply to the special edition email address:

There are a number of things you can put in the subject of your email.

'Articles' - for article submissions
'Contributions' - for general submissions (programs, pics, etc)
'Mailbag' - Letters
'Technical' - Technical queries

I look forward to receiveing some stuff.
