Interview with...
   Sebastian Jedruszkiewicz
   Author of Amiga Wolfenstein Port

---

WOA> What exactly is the legality of this port. Is it legal or not? Why
wasn't it allowed on Aminet?

SJ> It was not allowed? Who said that? I think it is legal. It was built
upon the sources by ID Software which were released for free.

NOTE: WOA found the port of Wolfenstein on a site whose space had been
allegedly donated to Sebastian because he had no where else to put it
as it was not allowed on Aminet. Since Sebastian claims this is not
true, WOA will be looking into this matter as soon as possible.

WOA> Did you create this port because it's become customary to port any
free PC source, or for another reason?

SJ> I was bored :)

---

WOA> Did you have any major problems when porting?

SJ> Usual things. Byte swapping routines were missing mainly.

---

WOA> What are your plans for the future?

SJ> I'm selling my Amiga next week :)
