>>>Up-To-Date!
In Association with Amiga.org (www.amiga.org)

Up To Date is a new section for WOA where we'll be detailing news which
has happened just days before the release of WOA. Rather than put it
in the main news file, I think it'll be better going into this one.

Amiga are now accepting Beta Testing applications.
--------------------------------------------------
Yes, that's right. The first product to come out of those Amiga
offices for a while will be in its beta stage by May according
to the Amiga website. You'll need a number of things to sign
up, one of which being a PGP encryption key for Email, and the
3.1 ROMs. Sign up at www.amiga.com/amigaos35/

EXCLUSIVE (?) - The PC Is Dead!
-------------------------------
Apparently, this is an exclusive. No-one else seems to have read
about the news that IBM are saying the PC era is over. Why not
read our article on it in the features directory.
