Taskbar Clones

If there's one thing in Windoze '95 that's been cloned on the Amiga far
too many times, it the Taskbar. Perhaps the only worthwhile part of
Windoze. This article intends to look at some of those taskbars and see
which one's are any good.

StopMenu

StopMenu is first. It's the newest of the Taskbar clones, and probably one
of the easiest to configure. It's two prefs programs contain nicely
laid out, easy to use configuration tools, and it's, on the whole,
very easy to use. The menu itself is a pretty standard start menu.
Click on one submenu and another menu comes out of it, that sort of thing.
However, this has one of the most fiddly window control (after StartMenu)
systems ever. The fact that you have to click on a button and a menu
of all your Windows will appear. Pretty annoying if you ask me :).
Overall, however, it's a very good program, and well worth a look.

StartMenu

This is also one of the finest Taskbar clones. It has an interface
very much like the actual Win95 Taskbar, and windows are put along the
bar itself which makes navigating through them all much easier. This
one also has an interesting feature where programs are started when
Startmenu is, and small icons appear in the task tray next to the clock
in the left hand bottom corner of the taskbar. Just like Windoze!

A-Start

I used to use this one a lot, however, I didn't know about this new
version (0.9), and I used to use 0.8 which was probably worse that this
(obviosuly :). A-Start is pretty good. Although it doesn't have a
window iconification system, the parts that are there are well done
and it's very easy to use and set up. But due to its lack of window
functions, it just can't be rated as good as the rest.
