Interview

We interviewed the maker of Stopmenu and asked a few questions related
to his Taskbar clone.

WOA> What made you want to develop a taskbar clone?

THOMSON> There was no good looking and functional taskbar for
         the Amiga. There was also no good exchange program.

WOA> Upon completing the project, did you feel there would have
     been an easier way of doing things?

THOMSON> Yes, many times :-)

WOA> If you could name one thing that Stopmenu lacks, what
     would it be?

THOMSON> Icon scaling functions, nice and usable MUI prefs and
         menu editor, and many other things.

WOA> What was the hardest part to code?

THOMSON> The menu functions. Opening many menus, checking
         delays and user inputs. And fast animation option.
         (usable on all ECS, AGA and GFX boards).

WOA> Any final words?

THOMSON> Thanks to everyone who registered Stopmenu!

We would like to point out that development of Stopmenu has now stopped
for the time being while a new coder is found. Anyone fancy the job?
