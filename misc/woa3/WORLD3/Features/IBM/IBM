IBM Big News

'The PC Era is over'

--------------------------------------------------------------------

That's right, if you haven't already read the news article this
issue, go and do it now because it's got completely true news
of IBM announcing that the PC is dead. It was reported a while
ago, and we can only hope that what IBM said is actually true and
we'll begin to see the PC market dwindle away before long.

We've scoured the Amiga Community and asked people's opinions on
this subject, and we've also contacted IBM to ask what they have
to say on the point that literally days before IBM's announcement,
Jum Collas had said new Amigas would be Information Applicance
type machines, and IBM said that's what the future of computing
was.

In the internet news story, it says: "Last year, [IBMs] personal
systems division, which makes desktops and servers, suffered a
US$992 million loss largely due to price competition

"This years report...outlined the companys future, and it will
increasingly de-emphasise the PC." It was reported that the huge
losses reported were actually a 516% drop in income over the
previous year.

        | 1998 Revenue   |   1997 Revenue   |   Change
--------^----------------^------------------^-------------------
Revenue | $12.8 Billion  |   $14.4 Billion  |   -10.8%

Income  | -$998 Million  |   -$161 Million  |   -516%

You may remember Jum Collas recently saying that new Amiga's would
be of the Information Appliance nature, days later, IBM dropped
this latest bombshell. We asked them to comment on the fact that
they have announced the future to be the very thing Amiga Inc
are currently working on.

Of course, IBM didn't bother to respond. Why say things if you can't
explain why you said 'em?

That's the end of this article, I'll leave you with some opinions of
some of our readers and well known Amigans.

"IMHO, a statement like this from IBM doesn't mean that much.  Sure, it
should be noted that this is IBM's opinion, but they are only words.  It's
not as if IBM have much leadership in the PC world nowadays.  If Intel
or Microsoft were to make the same statement, then that would obviously be
something something to stand up and take notice of.  As it is, that is
very unlikely to happen, for obvious reasons.

"As an Amigan, I could not be happy enough if all PCs shrivelled up and
died, because IBM said the era is over.  But, that simply isn't going to
happen.

"Sure, the PC may not be the best solution, but as long as Microsoft and
co keep pushing it, it'll live on.  The best we can hope for is that
alternative architectures (the Amiga-NG included) make it onto the market
and wipe the floor with the PC, so to speak.  Only then, will the PC
monopoly start to shrink.  Anyway, let's hope the new Amiga can fulfil
such a dream and that it is marketed in such a way that the opportunity
is maximised.

"For sure, the demise of the PC will not be an overnight thing - but, I'd
like to think the choice of computer systems will broaden starting in
the new millennium."
