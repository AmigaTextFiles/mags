AddAssigns V1.0 - (C) 1999 Trogladite Software

Just before I start - OK, this is created by my friend, but that doesn`t
nessesarily mean it is going to get a good review.

First of all, what does it do? Well this is sell explanitory - it adds
assigns. But this is slightly different from the other ones I have used.
The other ones I have used are just the same as the shell command, except
you dont need to use shell - these assigns were tempory, removed when you
reboot. This, however, not only has a selecter to select where it is to be
assigned to instead of just typing as with the others. This also saves the
assign to your user-startup, which can be useful - It`s a quick way to add
assigns to your user-startup.

What should have been or could be added? Well, several things. First of
all, as I said above, it adds it to your user-startup. In my opinion, this
program should have an option to only create a tempory assign, but if thats
what you want, you might as well just go to the shell and type it there.
Something else that would be useful, is the ability to list the assigns in
your user-startup and then be able to modify or remove them.

This is a nice utily that is useful for adding assigns quickly and easily
to you user startup. It works fine and I have not found any bugs yet. But
as it is, it is a bit basic and could offer a lot more, so it`s more of a
useful application rather than a `can`t live without` application.
