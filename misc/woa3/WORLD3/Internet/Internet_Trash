Internet Trash

We have only two this issue. Please nominate some crap sites by sending
email to woa@trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk. Thanks.

--- IBM
    www.ibm.com
    Company which started it all. The PC era started here, and apparently,
    ended here just a few days ago. Read the features section.

--- Microsoft
    www.microsoft.com
    This site uses over complicated stupid timewasting features which
    serve only to slow down the site. It's laid out well, but the
    content is so badly organised, it would take weeks to find a
    certain thing by hand. That's why there's a search facility. Hmm.
    Of course, that doesn't excuse it.
