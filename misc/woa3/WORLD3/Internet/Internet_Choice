Internet Choice

After scouring the net, we've found some sites which may be of interest
to you. If you've got any suggestions for us to check out, then send
them to woa@trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk and put 'Internet Choice' in the
subject line.

--- Trogsoft German
--- www.trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk/german
    This is the german version of our site for people in Germany (duh)
    The vocabulary might be a bit crap because it's all converted by
    the Altavista translation service.

--- IBM
--- www.ibm.com
    Yes, we know that these people started the whole PC thing, and for
    this they should be punished, but they are also the ones who
    have recently pronounced the PC dead. So they should be given
    a medal. And then killed :)

--- AmigaOS 3.5 Site
--- www.amiga.de/amigaos35/
    This contains screenshots of the latest AmigaOS with loads of
    info to go with it. Very Interesting.
