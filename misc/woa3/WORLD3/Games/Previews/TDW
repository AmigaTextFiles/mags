The Dead Walk

'The Dead Walk' is a Resident Evil style game for high end Amiga's. It
features stunning high resolution GFX and crisp clear audio, which combine
to create one of the scariest games in Amiga history. TDW is designed to
work on AGA 030 based systems but it is recommended that you have an 040
and a GFX card to get the most out of it. TDW has an advanced 3D engine and
particle system which runs smoothly and fluently to bring to life the 3D
polygon sprites.

TDW features many different brutal weapons which must be used to kill the
oncoming hordes of flesh eating zombies, ranging from swords to shotguns.
A ridiculous amount of blood will ensure this game appeals to gore lovers.


Special preview GFX now available


Looks like it should be good
