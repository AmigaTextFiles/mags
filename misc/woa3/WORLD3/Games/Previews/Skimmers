*WORLD OF AMIGA*

SKIMMERS
~~~~~~~~
Skimmers is a game a bit like that really sad attempt for a game 'Overdrive'
by Team 17. This is better and has a strategy section to it aswell.
Basically, you start off staring at a screen and you are given a small
piece of land. You choose where to extend this land to (in which
direction) and then, inevitabley, you get challenged by the computer
player(s).

Then you come in to the driving bit. You are given a thing, supposedly
a skimmer, and you drive around a track against whoever opposed your
land taking move. They always seem to challenge you, but I never
challenge them, so why do they do it to me?

But it's a good game and everything works as it should and it's the
first piece of programming which I've seen from someone who wrote
to Amiga format a while ago asking for a free plug. They're called
Team mango (why?) and hopefully they've made more games since this
(or before it) because if they have, I'd love to see them (hint hint)

Moving on completely, the graphics are absolutely superb and hardly
even slow the game down at all. There are these cool spinning CD
things when you select the music you want and there are some other
cool things too. I might jus put the game on disk two when we can find
a slot big enough to take it in our massive diisk 2 schedule which
we have planned ahead by 12 issues (that's two years!).

- Editors note:
This has been put in the Previews section because I have just heard
that it is going to be released commercially!
