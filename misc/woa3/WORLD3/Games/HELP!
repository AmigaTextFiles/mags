Position Available

You're probably aware that we are in desperate need of a new games
editor. After Antony's dwindling lack of input, I was forced to get
rid of him and now we need someone else. That's the reason for the
lack of games stuff this issue.

Games fans are probably a bit disappointed, and I bet a few others
are aswell, and if you're one of those who are disappointed with the
lack of games input, then do something about it!

Apply to be Games editor!
