*** Welcome to the AO update, volume 1, issue 4 - 15 Oct. 1999 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*** AO Update is a free weekly newsletter provided by Amiga.org
*** to tell you what is happening in the Amiga community.	
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First comes the inevitable question: "Where have you guys been?"

Apologies all around for our absence for the last month.  There
have been a string of events (starting with the tearing of a 
ligament in my right ankle) which has kept us from posting an 
AO Update for almost a month.  

I'd like to take a moment to personally thank everyone for the 
great and continuous support during this time away from the 
computer.

Quite simply as it turns out, no one else on staff here knows how 
to put out the update, so we "fell off the Earth" so to speak.  
Won't happen to often I hope. :)


-----
"Now what?" (AKA, rumors and public appearances)
-----
Editor's note: The last thing I EVER want to do with this 
newsletter is to endorse rumors and speculation in the 
community.  This little blurb isn't intended to do so at all, 
I just feel that there are some things that need to be addressed.
Since no one submitted any articles for the newsletter or site 
this week, here I go... :)

Over the last month, we've all dealt with Amiga's silence.  In 
a strange sort of way, the sudden lack of news and input from
Amiga has been deafening.  We were all building up hope, the
Amiga was building up momentum and community support, then Collas
left, now nothing.  Not a word, not a peep.

Correction: As I was writing this, we just received confirmation 
from Amiga (USA) that "No, we are not planning to attend Koln 
(Home Electronics World 99) or St. Louis (Amiga 2000) from Amiga 
in San Diego.  I believe Petro is still planning Koln.  I don't 
know about St Louis for him." 

A few more things have trickled our way, Darreck lisle is gone.
Matthias Grohmann is gone.  We here at Amiga.org want to wish both
success and rapid employment, as well as our sincere thanks and 
gratitude for all of the support they have shown to us in the 
past.  We will miss you.

With the loss of Darreck and Matthias, as well as Nicole 
Gottfried leaving the German office, does this all suggest that 
"Amiga is abandoning the community"?  Well, the honest truth is 
that yes, that's exactly what it suggests.  There's no way for
me to sit here in my office and deny the obvious appearances, 
but "Is it true"?

My gut reaction is "no".  Amiga hasn't officially "abandoned the 
community".  Lately, since Collas left, Amiga hasn't "officially"
done *anything*.  They haven't talked to the press, they haven't
talked to their supporters, they haven't talked to anyone.

Is that a bad thing?  That depends.  Commodore never said 
anything to us EXCEPT when they had product to ship (or heaven-
forbid, promote)...  In the eyes of this community, why does
Amiga Inc have to be any different?  (I can see the hate mail 
and cries of heresy from this one already :) )

The truth, as I understand it, is that a small section of the
community (let us refer to them as the Zealots) continually 
barraged Amiga Inc with hate mail and even threats any time
they ever announced anything.  As everyone knows, it's not the 
99% of a crowd who makes the loudest noise, it's the 1% Zealot
who make it unbearable.  Given the Zealots, who can blame Amiga 
Inc for simply shutting up? (which is all they've done).

I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  "Some people in 
this world would have a problem if Amiga said 'Surprise! here's 
a free MCC for every existing classic owner' ".

Am I blindly defending Amiga Inc?  No. I'm simply stating the 
only fact that I know.  That fact is that there are no facts where
Amiga Inc is concerned any more.  They aren't talking, and to be
honest, it makes no difference to either the 4000 or 1200 sitting
on my desk.  If Amiga pulls off the revolution it so highly claims,
we'll all be good to go.  If not, we're still in better shape than
we would have been if the patents had gone unpurchased.

Amiga.org will go on, news will trickle in, and life will 
continue on it's merry way.  See you next Friday.

Latest Payback News
(1999-10-15)
Apex Designs have posted some more news about the status of 
Payback, their GTA-like game for the Amiga. They've developed a 3d
sound system that can play 12 channels of sound at once on a 
standard Amiga. It also realisticaly simulates the doppler effect
and the inverse-square law, all in full stereo. The effect on game 
speed is negligable, and AHI is not required. They've also been 
talking to several bands about providing songs for the game.
