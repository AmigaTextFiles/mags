@NODE edit "Editorial Page"
Well, Halloween has come and gone and there are still no official new 
owners for the Amiga.  Many Amiga related publications are now just 
assuming that Commodore UK has gotten the nod.  This is a dangerous 
practice.  It doesn't do any good to do this, it just confuses people.

Many people have gone out of their way to keep the Amiga community
informed and up-to-date.  Jason Compton from Amiga Report has arranged
online conferences with Alex Amor from CEI.  Dan Stets from the
Philadelphia Inquirer has been appearing on Compuserve every Sunday night
with updates.  Dan Sullivan and AmigaWorld have been doing their best to
keep their telephone information line updated.  We'd like to thank them
all for doing their part in getting the truth out and keeping all of us
closer to the action (or lack thereof.)

Amiga Entertainment Monthly hasn't been as active in keeping our readers
up-to-date mainly because we don't have the resources to do so.  We will
not, however, assume that one group or another has gotten the green light
to manufacture and market the Amiga again.  That's just unethical and we
don't need story ideas bad enough to do that.

We will report on the new owners as soon as they've been officially
announced.  We'll attempt to bring the true story to you as soon as 
possible.

Until that happens, we've got some goodies for you.  This month, we
present a complete review of the Zappo CD-ROM drive for the Amiga 1200.  I
believe we're the first US publication to have a review of the drive, but
I can't verify that.  Next month, we should start seeing a lot of the
Christmas releases appearing.  FIELDS OF GLORY arrived just a little too
late to make this issue.  It looks like a decent war simulation at
first glance.  Also too late to make this issue is the AGA version of 
UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN!  It'll be interesting to see how well it can stack 
up to the PC version (which is known as X-COM: UFO DEFENSE here in the 
States.)  

Until next month, have fun with your Amiga!

@NODE THANKS "Thanks and Kudos!"
Thanks to all the readers that keep reading this newsletter every month.
We seem to be getting quite a following.  Keep supporting the Amiga and
we'll do the same!

We had planned a contest that was to be a sort of "thank you" to 
all the readers.  However, we have decided to do a reader survey.  This
reader survey will help us improve AEM, plus one lucky reader will win an
Amiga or CD남 game just for responding to the survey.

@NODE GAME1 "ARCADE POOL Review"
ARCADE POOL
System: CD남

There haven't been many good two-player games for the CD남.  There have
been some attempts at them though.  Some like CD FOOTBALL and BRUTAL 
FOOTBALL succeeded, while others like DANGEROUS STREETS and SUMMER OLYMPIX
have missed the mark.

ARCADE POOL attempts to recreate the experience of going down to the local
pool hall and shooting a few games.  The CD남 version goes so far as to
include a constantly running track of background noise from a pub, complete
with laughter, conversation and coughing to "enhance" the experience.

ARCADE POOL includes UK and US versions of the game as well as trickshot
and tournament modes.  Instant replays of the last shot and a statistics
screen are also available at anytime during the game.

I'm sure most of you are familiar with the basics behind pool and it's
various games.  All of the major games are included here: US and UK 8
ball, US 9 ball and 15 ball.  The rules are all very easy to learn and you
may be finding yourself playing a game you'd never think you'd play. 
(I've been playing a lot of the UK 8 ball, for some reason.)

One major downfall with most computer billiards games is the correct
application of physics to the software.  If the programmers can't
accurately make a shot act as it should in real-life, there's no point in
the game.  The physics in ARCADE POOL are among the best I've seen in an
electronic pool game.  Bank shots and cuts are very much like they'd be on
a real pool table.  The only quibble is the size of the balls.  They're a
bit on the large side.  

I have no major gripes about the game at all.  The accurate physics and 
easy to learn shot mechanism make ARCADE POOL a satisfying solitaire game 
and an outstanding two-player game.

@NODE GAME2 "GUARDIAN Review"
GUARDIAN
System: CD남

Remember all the hoopla surrounding the release of STARFOX for the Super
Nintendo?  It didn't look all that impressive to me.  Yet, to those people
that have never seen an Amiga in action, it was impressive.  I knew the
Amiga could handle a game like that with no problem (and since the CD남 is 
also an Amiga, I knew it could handle it as well.)

GUARDIAN isn't exactly like STARFOX.  It's more of a 3D version of
DEFENDER, the old arcade game that put you in charge of destroying aliens
before they could steal humans from the face of the planet.

If you've never seen STARFOX, it's a 3D polygon based flight game in which
you witness everything from slightly behind the on-screen representation
of your ship.  GUARDIAN has a similar type of setup, but allows more 
freedom in where you can fly and also allows you to change your view to
be pretty much wherever you want it to be.

Numerous enemies come after you in an attempt to snuff you out.  A very
confusing control system (that involves all four action buttons on the 
CD남 controller) makes it hard to concentrate on what you're doing while
you should be doing it.  I spent a lot of time flying around in circles 
just shooting blindly hoping to hit something until I thinned out the 
enemy enough to use the onscreen radar to single out opponents and go 
after them.

It's a shame that the game is so hard to control, because it looks fairly
impressive at first glance.  After playing if for awhile, it's another
frustrating and disappointing CD남 game that doesn't do the machine
justice.  The controls do not need to be so confusing and the graphics
appear to be more than the machine can keep up with when a lot is going on
(which is most of the time.)

It's obvious that a lot of work has gone into the game.  The designers 
even went so far as to include a preferences option that allows you to 
move the screen position to allow the normally PAL mode game to fit on an 
NTSC screen.  That's a feature I wish more CD남 games had.

If you've been searching for something a little different, you might want
to try GUARDIAN.  It's limitations aren't severe, just frustrating.  With
a proper amount of patience, it might be possible to salvage some fun from
this disc.

@NODE GAME4 "KING'S QUEST VI Review by Marc Buhmann"
KING'S QUEST VI
SYSTEM: Amiga 500 or higher
HARD DRIVE INSTALLABLE: Yes
MEMORY REQUIRED: 1 MB or higher
CONTROLLER: Joystick
Workbench 1.3/2.x/3.x compatible

The company Sierra has been out of the Amiga industry since mid 1992.
Their last game was a game based on Robin Hood (the name escapes me
at this time). When that game was released, Sierra's last words to
the Amiga community was that the Amiga was a poor computer and that
the games they were going to release would not work on the Amiga. With
that they left the Amiga platform for the other "advanced" computers.

Though Sierra hasn't really entered the Amiga platform again, they
have given the rights to Revolusion Software to do a port. In case you
don't know, Revolusion Software was the company that released "Beneath
A Steel Sky", one of my personal favorites. I have no doubts that this
game will be a hit also.

One thing I dislike is Sierra takes all credit for the game "King's
Quest VI". No where on the box or in the manual is Revolusion Software
mentioned. I just feel this is a bit unfair and that RS should recieve
some credit.

Now onto the actual game. Installing to a hard disk is not a quick
procedure. So be ready to do something while the program installs. It
doesn't take as long as "BASS", but that's because it only has 10 disks
compared to "BASS"'s 15 disks. It takes an estimated 1 hour and 15
minutes to install. Remember that this was installing with a 68000
processor, it might be sped up if you have a faster processor.

Though the graphics are nice, they don't attract me to them like some
other games. RS did a good job at changing the graphics from 256 colors
to the ECS 32 colors. They are nice, but not real great. The animation
is choppy at some points, but MUCH faster than "King's Quest V" was.
This, I'm sure, is also due to the fact I only have a 68000 processor.
My guess would be 68020 would be good, but 68030 would be the best. I
don't know how fast the game will be with a 68040 and I can't even
imagine what a 68060 will do.

The inventory pictures are another thing entirely. They are all in a
tannish color. Some of the pictures don't look anything like what
they're supposed to be. They could have spiced this up a bit.

The music is nice. But it seems that there is only one piece of music.
No matter where you go, the music is the same. To bad you can't shut
it off some how.

The puzzles are complex, but very logical. The usual Sierra game. You
can't pick up a weapon, like a sword, but you can pick up a tooth
pick. For the most part, the puzzles will take a little thinking to
figure out.

LIKES AND DISLIKES

I like the fact that a game company like Sierra who said they'd never
produce a game for the Amiga again finally realized the Amiga IS
capable of playing their games. It's also a nice fact that Sierra
realized that they don't know how to program for the Amiga so they got
a company who DOES know to port "KQ6" for them. They may be becoming
brighter. Any other "likes"? No. Everything about the game is just
plain average. Music isn't special, graphics aren't special, game plot
isn't special, etc...

Dislikes are another story completely. There is no way to exit the
game when your done so you have to reboot. I don't like how long the
game takes to install on a hard disk. When you die in the game, you
to go through the entire opening sequence from when you wash ashore.
Not all the bugs have been taken out of the game (e.g. once I walked
into the library to find the librarian was missing half his body.
Another example is when I wanted to talk to a book worm, I had to talk
to him from a stack of books behind him) A final thing I dislike is
that the Amiga version has a few things removed from the original IBM
version. I called Sierra to find out what they all removed, but they
didn't know (duh!).

@NODE GAME5 "Quick Capsule Reviews"
This is a quick glance at some games I had a chance to play for a bit, but
didn't get a chance to do a complete review of:

CLOCKWISER - (Amiga)
A puzzle game with a few interesting twists.  Definitely NOT a game that
will win any awards for graphics, but the puzzles are brain benders and
very clever.  This is a game that the whole family can play and enjoy. 
This kind of game that may not set the world on fire, but could definitely
be a sleeper.  A game worth seeking out if you like puzzles.

OVERALL RATING: 85%      Video Mode: PAL

BUBBLE AND SQUEAK - (Amiga)
Ugh, another cutesy platform game.  Unless you're completing a collection 
of all the Euro-platform games with mindless scenarios and unbearably cute
characters, avoid this like the plague.

@NODE RATINGS "The Ratings - Explained"

We judge the games we review in four different categories:

Graphics
--------
This is pretty self explanatory.  The higher the percentile, the better
the graphics are.

Sound
-----
Another no-brainer.  The higher the percentile, the better the sound. 
Although, this also relates to it's coordination with the gameplay.  If 
the sound seems inappropriate for the type of game it is, the game will
score lower in the Sound category even if the sounds are technically well
done.

Gameplay
--------
The gameplay refers to the addictive quality of the game as well as the
way the game plays.  If you find your self sitting and watching rather
than interacting with the game, the game will score lower than one that
actually involves you.

Control
-------
This refers to how easy the game is to control given the control method
specified by the manufacturer. A game requiring a special controller 
that is not specified or not included will be penalized.  A game that 
comes with a special controller or one that recommends that, say, an 
Amiga mouse might work better than the standard CD남 controller will 
not be penalized.  A game that is programmed to use a mouse when a
joystick would be much more appropriate would also be penalized.  Of
course, a game that's just plain hard to control with any control method
will also feel the sting of the rating.

This is an award presented to one game per month for being the worst of

that's REALLY bad.

If we have an issue with no really bad games...there'll be no award given.

@NODE ZAP "Zappo/Overdrive CD-ROM Drive Review"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
I know a lot of readers are really interested in reading about the Zappo
CD-ROM drive for the Amiga 1200.  I would like to warn all of you that
this review is based on two weeks of testing the Zappo drive.  After that
period of time, the drive began to fail on a regular basis.  We may have
received a defective drive.  We are getting a new one in and will re-test
it using the same basic methods used to construct this review.  However, I 
don't think the performance of the drive was affected in any way because
this review was completed before the drive failed.  If any performance
difference is noted, we'll post an update in the next AEM.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ever since the CD남 arrived on the scene, A1200 owners have been asking
for a way to play CD남 games on their machines.  It's not an unreasonable
request since the machines are virtually identical, except for the Akiko
chip that is present only in the CD남.

Commodore had promised a CD남 compatible drive, and had even displayed it
in Europe, but it never made it to production.  Zappo, a UK company,
announced a drive that would do the same thing and also beat Commodore at
it's own game because Commodore's drive asked the A1200 user to give up
his trapdoor expansion slot.  Zappo's doesn't use the trapdoor slot; it
makes use of the little used PCMCIA slot on the left side of the machine.

The Zappo/Overdrive CD-ROM drive (aka the Archos CD-ROM drive) is a
standard Mitsumi double speed CD-ROM drive with a special interface
allowing the cable with the PCMCIA card connector to be attached.  A disk 
with special driver software is included as well.

For our tests, we used a stock Amiga 1200 with no FAST RAM and no
accelerator board.  We wanted to stay as close to the configuration of a
CD남 as possible.  If you've got any FAST RAM or an accelerator board,
your results with the Zappo may differ from ours.

Setting the drive up is fairly simple once a proper power supply is
obtained.  The Zappo we received came with a power supply meant for 
European use.  A trip to Radio Shack provided us with the proper power 
source:  A 12 Volt power supply.

Just plug the PCMCIA card connector into the slot and install the software 
(which automatically makes necessary changes to your startup-sequence.)
  
[Take note:  The PCMCIA connector has some writing on it.  The natural
inclination is to have that writing facing up, so you can read it, when
you plug the connector in.  In fact, the writing should be facing down or
the drive won't work.   The manual didn't mention this at all.]  

After rebooting, the computer will automatically recognize any CD placed
in the drive just like putting a disk in the disk drive.  You can access
any ISO-9660 format CD-ROM disc with this method.  This makes a wide
variety of CD-ROM software available to you, like GIFS GALORE, AMINET and
the ULTIMATE MOD COLLECTION to name a few.

What I'm sure most of you want to know, though, is how it handles CD남
games and software.  By pressing the left mouse button and holding it down
while the machine reboots, you are presented with an option to boot from a
CD-ROM.

Placing a CD남 disc in the drive, pressing CTRL-LEFT AMIGA-RIGHT AMIGA to
reset the machine, and then holding down the left mouse button to get the
menu will allow the world of CD남 software to open for you.

I was surprised at the number of CD남 titles that ran without any problems
at all.  Even PAL games were no problem.  (Although, they added some steps
to the process:  You have to put the disc in the drive, reset the machine,
hold down BOTH mouse buttons to get the display menu, select PAL, then
boot the machine from the menu, then hold down just the LEFT mouse button
and select the CD BOOT option.  It's confusing at first, but it works
like a champ.)

We tested a LOT of CD남 software on the Zappo drive.  A lot of them worked 
with the above methods without a problem.  Some, however, needed to be 
booted from the disk version of the drivers rather than the ones installed 
on the hard drive.   We weren't really sure why this was, but it was 
limited to only a few games.

Here's a list of the CD남 games and software we tested on the Zappo drive:

INSIGHT: TECHNOLOGY
ZOOL
WHALE'S VOYAGE
ULTIMATE BODY BLOWS
TROLLS
UNIVERSE
SUPER METHANE BROTHERS
SUMMER OLYMPIX
GUNSHIP 2000
OSCAR
NIGEL MANSELL'S CHAMPIONSHIP RACING
NICK FALDO GOLF
MEAN ARENAS
JAMES POND III
HEIMDALL II
LOTUS TRILOGY
LOST VIKINGS
FURY OF THE FURRIES
INTERNATIONAL KARATE +
BANSHEE 
SIMON THE SORCEROR
BRUTAL FOOTBALL
FIRE FORCE
DIGGERS
DEFENDER OF THE CROWN II
DEEP CORE
DANGEROUS STREETS
CASTLES
BATTLETOADS
NAUGHTY ONES
FRONTIER
RYDER CUP GOLF
CD FOOTBALL
UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN

We, unfortunately, didn't have a copy of MICROCOSM to test on the Zappo
drive.  This would have provided the ultimate compatibility test.

The manufacturer's claim that the Zappo drive emulates the Akiko chip
through software.  I don't know how true that is, but the drive does run a
lot slower than the CD남 during heavy animations that may use the Akiko
chip.  For example, the GUNSHIP 2000 intro animation runs fairly smooth
on a CD남.  On the Zappo drive, the animation was choppy and jerky and the
sound was slightly out-of-sync.  It DID run though.  That's one of the
reasons we were so interested to see if MICROCOSM would run or not.  It
wouldn't be very playable if it was as choppy as the GUNSHIP 2000
animation was.  We will test MICROCOSM as soon as we get a copy to test.

Well, what doesn't work?  The following is a list of the games that we
tested that didn't work.  These games just plain refused to run no matter
what we tried.  The symptoms of each game are listed to explain possible
compatibility issues that may be addressed in the next update to the
Zappo's software drivers.

GAMES THAT DON'T WORK ON THE ZAPPO DRIVE

SIMON THE SORCERER
Error message - "No disk present in device CD0"

OSCAR
Must boot from the floppy and the game will load, but it crashes soon after.

SURF NINJAS
Error message - "No disk present in device CD0"

CD FOOTBALL
Game loads, but options are cycled through by the computer.  If one is 
picked, the game crashes.  The game doesn't get far enough to see if the
CDXL animations work or not.

UNIVERSE
Game loads and then crashes right after.

DEFENDER OF THE CROWN II
Error message - "Bookit only works on CDTV"

BATTLETOADS
Game doesn't load - black screen is the only result.

BANSHEE
Error message - "Bans.exe not enough memory available"

LOTUS TRILOGY 
Game loads, displays logo and then goes black.

RYDER CUP GOLF
Game loads, plays music and looks fine, but as soon as a course is 
selected, the machine GURU's.

According to the manufacturer, an update to the software will increase
CDTV compatibility as well as allow the drive to be used with the Amiga
600 (although, it will not run CD남 software on the 600).

SUMMARY

The Zappo drive is a surprisingly good piece of hardware.  I had my doubts
when I first heard about it, but it made a good impression on me.  I'd
really think about buying it if I had an Amiga 1200 instead of a CD남. 

There are some weaknesses with the Zappo drive though:

1)  The interface that plugs on to the back of the Mitsumi drive to 
connect the PCMCIA connector doesn't fit well and can work itself loose.

2)  The aforementioned "does the writing face up or down?" problem needs 
to be addressed.  

3)  The manual is not much of a help with any potential problems. 
This review has more information than the manual contains.

4)  The access time is slow and that may cause problems with discs that
access a lot of information all the time, like UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN, which
is slow enough on the CD남.  How it will affect a game like MICROCOSM is
yet to be seen.  (If that game runs at all.)

All in all, the Zappo drive bridges a gap in a way that's similar to the
way the Paravision SX-1 bridges the gap for CD남쟯wners.  It's not quite
as reliable as the SX-1, but it's got room for improvement and I'm sure it
will receive those improvements with software updates.

Minnesota, Kansas City or All Madden.  When kicking, move the bar as far
to the right as possible and kick with as little power as possible.  You 
should always catch the ball around the 40 yard line and have a first
