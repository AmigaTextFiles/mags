About Mealström

        Mealstreöm is a new  freely distributable diskzine dedicated to the Amiga.
It's purpose is to help other amiga users out there to fully understand and master their machine.
Mealström will cover almost anything.
From workbench to 68k assembly over to other subjects like Japanese animation and manga, and 
this in a monthly edition!.
Some topics, like workbench and manga will only be covered in future releases though, because my 
diskzine engine isn't finished jet.
But i need your help and support for this project, that's why i would like to receive feedback, articles 
and reviews from you, the reader, as it's impossible for me to buy and review every new product 
that's released.
So anyone out there that thinks he got's what it takes to write them, start writing!!!
I'll even make it easy for you by letting you chose in what language you write.
You may chose one of these three:
        English
        Dutch
        French
I'll now give you the small rules to follow, if you want to send contributions:
        1-: Use standard amiga 880 KB. Floppies (Double dens¡ty, the ones with only one hole in 
        them) or 1.44 MB. floppies in P.C. format.
        Letters larger than an A5 page will be ignored!
        (You have been warned)
        2-: Use standard amiga ASCII text.
        3-: Make your texts as clearly as possible.
That's it, Now start sending'em in!
I"m counting on your help.
