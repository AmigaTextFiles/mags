Amos the creator, the guide

This little old basic interpreter has been around for several years now, but it's still very popular, so i'll 
be covering this one as well.
The real guide will start in one of the next releases, as i want to do an introduction to programming 
first.
The version of the interpreter i'll be covering is 1.3 (If anybody has an update for a newer version why 
not mail it to me? :-)).
If you have any request about this topic please contact me, details can be found in the file 
"correspondence" on the disk.
