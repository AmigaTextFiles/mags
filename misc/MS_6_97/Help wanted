Help wanted

As i am only one man i'm looking for people willing to help me with this project.
So if you are willing to do articles on the following topics please contact me. (Check out the file 
"About Mealström" for details)
        1- Music, the creation of a mod & midi file plus the programming of music on the amiga.
        2- AREXX, I haven't got docs on this so i can't start learn it.
        3- 3D, If there are any graduates out there who are willing to do articles on 3D calculations 
                please contact me.
        4- Manga, I haven't got the time to do features and reviews on these myself.
I hope to get your help on these subjects and if you want other topics to be handled as well, then 
contact me (see "correspondence").
