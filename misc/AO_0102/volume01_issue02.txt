We're back!

Apologies for the delay Ladies and Gents. I wanted to post this 
last Friday, but we decided to wait until we had returned from 
Amiga Atlanta's second-annual "Power Picnic".  Let me just say, 
a great time and a massive amount of wonderful food was had by all.  
Lots of people including Frank Davis (FWD Computing), Joe Torre, 
and the ever-memorable Robert Hamilton were on hand to meet, greet, 
and talk over the Amiga and it's current situation...  Great job 
guys and I'll see you next year.

Speaking of the current situation, I hope you've all read the 
debunk of the BusinessWeek.com "article" that I posted on the site.
If not, allow me to point you in the direction of

	http://amiga.org/articles/1999/0911-opinion.shtml

In short, Relax folks, the BusinessWeek.com article is simply 
another example of sloppy journalism.  No need to picket or e-mail
bomb the Gateway compound just yet.

-----------
Open Forums
-----------
With the removal of the Amiga site's Bulletin Board, we feel 
compelled to remind you that our open forums are still available
so if you have something to say about the current Amiga 
situation, you should feel free to post them here -

	http://amiga.org/cgi-local/bbcgi/Ultimate.cgi
	
---------
New Staff
---------
We're very happy to announce the addition of two new team members.

James Russell 
James comes to us as the news editor.  His other efforts include 
the not-so-small task of running Amiganation.com.  He's proving to
be a valuable member of the team and I'd encourage each of you to
drop in and see his other works.
http://www.amiganation.com

Kent Seaton
Kent is the guy we're putting in charge of Public Relations for the
site(s) here at Amiga.org..  He's got a large task ahead of him but
so far he seems to be very good at what he does.


-------------
AO Beta Watch
-------------
As most of you know, the new Amiga.org 5.0 is still in what we 
consider "beta mode".  We also now openly refer to Amiga.org by 
revision numbers.  We do so, quite honestly because Amiga.org is
our product to you, the site user and visitor.  As a product, we 
feel that it's progress should be traceable.

Did you know that you can keep up with changes to the system?  On 
the lower left-hand corner of the main page, you'll see a display
of the current revision number with a link to 

	http://amiga.org/version.shtml
	
which will let you track our progress.  If you have suggestions, or
notice problems with the site, please, please let us know by 
dropping an e-mail to webmaster@amiga.org as soon as possible.
