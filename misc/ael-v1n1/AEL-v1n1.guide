Editor's Corner             by @{"Lori Vinciguerra" link P6}

With the growing interest in using computers in schools, it is clear that
there must be some Amigas being used for educational purposes. Currently,
there is no means of finding other Amiga educators, allowing us to
exchange ideas and talk about new products. This newsletter has been
created to act as a forum for people using their Amigas in schools or at
home for educational purposes.  It will include a discussion section,
interviews, new product announcements, and articles on educational uses
for our machines.  Those of you who are currently using an education
software product are encouraged to write reviews for publication. We
would also like to receive articles about what you are doing with your
Amigas.  This will give others who read the newsletter contacts for
people who may be doing similar projects.

The AEL newsletter will be available electronically for those of you who
have the capability to download it.  I will mail copies to anyone else
who is interested in receiving it.  The current plan is to publish the
newsletter on a quarterly basis in January, April, July, and October.  If
there is significant input the publishing schedule may go to bimonthly.
Initially the cost for subscription will be nothing.  We will try to
remain a free publication unless the distribution list for copying and
mailing becomes large.  Those of you who download the magazine will be
able to maintain a free subscription. The magazine will be available on
any Aminet site and via the OWL Software BBS.

We encourage any inputs for the January 1995 issue be sent to OWL
Software no later than November 15, 1994.  Submissions can be made via
e-mail to owl@davinci.reading.ma.us or via mail to 460 Summer Ave.,
Reading, MA  01867. The success of this newsletter will depend on your
input.  Good luck in your upcoming fall semester projects.

ASpringies is a simulator which allows you to interactively create and
edit a system of masses and springs.  The parameters of the masses and
springs (such as mass elasticity and spring K) as well as those of the
surrounding system (such as air viscosity and gravity) can be changed.
These systems can be loaded and saved into a file.

ASpringies is the Amiga port of the program 'xspringies' by Douglas
DeCarlo.

     Features:
       - Smooth, double buffered animation
       - Context sensitive hypertext help system
       - MUI (Magic User Interface)
       - includes source code

The author would be interested to have input from any educator on how
this program is useful and how it could be improved.

Requirements: Kickstart V37 (2.0) or above, MUI (Magic User Interface,
version 2.2 or above),  A Floating Point Coprocessor (FPU), or standard
68040 and above

Downloading from Aminet               by Ralph L. Vinciguerra


This publication and other Amiga resources are available on something
called Internet. The Internet is a global network connecting hundreds of
thousands of computers together at high speed. If you have a computer
account at a school, university, or company, that computer may well be
connected to the Internet. You might also have access to a personal
computer which is connected to the Internet directly.

Aminet is a group of machines connected to the Internet which each have
duplicate copies of Amiga software. Whenever any new item is uploaded to
one of the machines, it is automatically copied to all the other Aminet
machines. This helps to distribute the load so that each geographic
region can connect to the closest or least used machine.

There are several programs you can use to access the Aminet resources.
You'll need to try to run the commands to see if they are available. It
also depends on what kind of computer you are connected to. On UNIX
computers the commands to try are: Mosaic (if you are using the X Window
system), lynx or ftp (if you are use a terminal, or an emulation of one).
On personal computers, the Mosaic program is also available as well as
several others which operate in a similar fashion.

Both Mosaic and lynx use a new technique for accessing the Internet what
is called the World Wide Web (WWW). The WWW is a new way to travel the
Internet without having to understand special protocols or complex
commands. If you have either Mosaic or lynx you can connect to the Aminet
archives by directing Mosaic to "Open URL" or using the "g" command in
lynx to enter one of the following URL's:

 Location URL
 ------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
 USA(MO) http://ftp.wustl.edu/~aminet/
 USA(CA) http://ftp.cdrom.com/aminet/
 Switz.  http://www.eunet.ch/~aminet/
 UK      http://web.doc.ic.ac.uk/public/aminet/info/www/home-src.doc.html
 Germany ftp://epix.rrze.uni-erlangen.de/public/pub/amiga/aminet/aminet.html
 Germany http://www.informatik.tu-muenchen.de:80/isar/archive/amiga/

Then you can simply select the choices that appear on the screen. These
tools are easy to learn and very effective. Both Mosaic and lynx have
built in hypertext help. Use the menus in Mosaic, and use the "?" command
in lynx.

If you can not run Mosaic or lynx then you can connect to an Aminet
machine by using something called anonymous ftp. Here is a list of Aminet
sites:

     Location     Machine Name            Machine "IP Address"
     ------------ ----------------------- --------------------
     USA (MO)     ftp.wustl.edu           128.252.135.4

     Germany      ftp.coli.uni-sb.de      134.96.68.11
     Germany      ftp.uni-stuttgart.de    129.96.8.13
     UK           ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk        146.169.2.1
     Australia    splat.paxnet.edu.au     192.107.107.6 (*)
        (*) closed 6:30am to 4pm weekdays

To connect to a site (for example ftp.wustl.edu) simply type ftp followed
by a space and name of the machine.  (For example:  ftp ftp.wustl.edu).
If your computer cannot recognize the name, you can try the "IP Address"
instead.

You will then be asked for a login name at which point you should type
"anonymous" (no quotes). If there are not too many people on the ftp site
you will be asked next for a password.  At this point you should type
your e-mail address. Now you have reached the ftp site and may begin to
look around for Amiga files. Typically they are kept in a directory
labelled /pub/aminet. The most common commands you can use are:

  Command        Description
  -------------  ----------------------------------------------------------
  bin            Changes the transfer mode to binary (always do this)
  hash           Makes the program display markers during downloads (handy)
  cd <directory> Moves you to a directory (fill in the <>'d value)
  ls             Lists the contents of the current directory
  get <filename> Brings a file to your machine (fill in the <>'d value)
  ?              Displays all the available commands
  quit           exits the ftp program

When downloading a file from Aminet, you will first download it to the
machine which has the Internet access.  This is done with the command
"get". Before transferring the file type "bin <return>" and "hash
<return>". This will ensure that you will be able to transfer binary
files and see the progress of the transfer. Now go to the directory which
contains the file which you will want to download and type "get
<filename>".  The file will appear on the Internet machine after logging
off of the ftp site.

After transferring the file to the Internet machine you may wish to
download it to your Amiga. Use any type of transfer protocol with which
you are familiar.  Some of the common ones are Kermit and ZModem.  Make
sure that you use a protocol which can accept binary files. If you are
connected to a UNIX machine you can use the programs "kermit" or
"sz"(Zmodem) to send files to your Amiga. If you are on a personal
computer, your can try to write the files to a floppy using MS-DOS format
and then read them into your Amiga floppy drives using any of the Amiga
techniques which can read MS-DOS format.

It's difficult to cover all the details in a short article, but there's
enough here to get you started. You may want to find someone who has done
these operations before to help you through them once if you get stuck.
Most people who use the Internet are very excited about it and are glad
to help someone learn the ropes. Good luck!
