Below is an advert from Andrew King of Q-Group:- <P>

<UL>
We at Q-Group are looking for a graphics artist to draw graphics and
art for a new game due for commercial release in 1998.<P>

Our new game is called fUbAR and details about the game can be found at
http://homepages.nildram.co.uk/~oondy.  It's an action/strategy war
game which has taken the best bits from many classic and modern games,
pulling them into one.  It's been set to be big by people just looking
at the website and talking to me direct.<P>

You must be extremely talented graphically wise, and have a year or two
at least of game graphics experience.  You will be able to use colours
to the maximum and be very creative and original in your drawing.<P>

You also must be in the United Kingdom, speak english (it helps :), have
an internet connection and a phone.  Communication like this is very
important, since Q-Group members are distributed around the country.
IRC capabilities would greatly benefit.<P>

To give you an idea of the workload, there are tiled background graphics,
static images, animated images, sprites and bobs (static and animated),
full motion video (since fUbAR is due to be a strictly CD-only release),
and anything else that would be appropriate.<P>

Send your queries and artwork demos or portfolios in lha/jpg format (but
ASK before sending anything over 64K!) to..<BR>

Anyone who is interested please do not hesitate to contact them and be part of
what is looking to be an excellent game.<P>
