<CENTER><H2>Ian's Homepage At Geocities Breaks The 500 
Barrier</H2></CENTER>
<P>
In the last week of November, Webtracker at Ian's Homepage at Geocities indicated 
that more than 500 people have the site since it's birth.  Expect to see significant 
changes to the site once it breaks the 1000 barrier.
<p>
<CENTER><H2>HBomb! Latest</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The following is from the Aurora Works web site and gives the latest information on 
HBomb!
<p>
<b>Short Game Description</b>
<p>
Although H-Bomb has a battle mode that can be played by one player or
more against the computer, at its heart, H-Bomb is a multi-player blast fest!  The 
ultimate party game, based
loosely on the hugely successful Bomberman concept, Hover-Bomber (H-Bomb) 
brings new
life to a classic by modernizing the game environment for today's high-tech
computers.  With support for up to 4 people playing either locally or
remotely, H-Bomb promises fast-paced multi-player action that will surely
cause plenty of good-natured rivalry and vendettas between you and your
friends!

The latest news on OnEscapee is that Sadeness should have it in stock on the 16th 
December, with a patch for CyberGFX support appearing on the Aminet in about a

Jan/Feb'98 as development seems to be taking longer than expected.
