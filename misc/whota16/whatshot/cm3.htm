<P>
Their is a small chance that we could get Championship Manager 3 for the Amiga 
but it's up to you whether we can get this excellent title which is even still in 
development.
<br>
<br>
On the Amiga Championship Manager 3 Campaign web site you find a form which 
I urge you to fill in.  The developers, Sports Interactive Ltd have shown their 
support for an Amiga version.  There is the possibly that an Amiga Publisher could 
try to gain a License to develop and Publish this title for the Amiga.
<br>
<br>
It's now up to you to show your support and I hope with all the Games News 
Amiga Flame has provided for you for over a year, you could take some time out 
to fill a form in.  This form can be found at the web address below.
