</H2></CENTER>
<P>

Amiga Inc, in association with Amiga.org wish to announce the formation
of the Official Amiga User Group Network. Designed with both Amiga User
Groups and Amiga, Inc. in mind, the User Group Network (UGN) will allow 
User Groups and Amiga, Inc. to interact in close cooperation.<BR><BR>

The User Group Network is an internet-based system intended to get 
essential news out to the users as quickly and efficiently as possible 
by presenting a unified interface between Amiga, Inc. and the user 
groups.  News from Amiga, Inc. is fed directly to the User Group
Network, then broadcast to all of the network members via direct e-
mail.<BR><BR>

To join the User Group Network, please visit the User Group Network site 
at <a 
href="http://www.amiga.org/usergroups">http://www.amiga.org/usergroups</a> 
to fill out a quick and easy web
form.  Your group's information is then placed in the Official User Group
Registry which will be available for everyone.<BR><BR>

More information about this project can be found at the User Group
Network site on <a 
href="http://www.amiga.org/usergroups">Amiga.org</a>.<BR><BR><BR>
