<FONT SIZE="6">M</FONT>AX Rally is an multi-player overhead racing game 
from
Fortress Software. It Some of you may remember it from a piece that was in Amiga
Format quite a while back. Well, since then, the game has been slowly worked on
and is now looking like it will be ready for release sometime in the next few
months.<P>
The game is an overhead racer in the All Terrain Racing/Super Cars mould.  It
allows up to four players to race against each other in the multipayer battle
mode at once.  This is acheived by serial linking two computers together and
having two players on each computer playing with a split screen.  It is also
possible to have a one player full screen, a two player link up and a single
computer two player split screen race.<P>

The game supports a number of different game modes, one of which is the
championship mode.  In this mode one player will have to race on 25 different
tracks across four different terrains against three computer cars.  To help, the
player will have the use of five continues.  In addition to this five of the
tracks will come under the name of 'MAX Rally Challenge'.  These will allow the
player to gain extra continues.

There will also be a time trail mode.  In this mode 1-4 players will be
able to race, on there own, against the clock to set the fastest time possible.
All lap records are permanantly stored so you will be able to create your own
fastest laps table (Maybe an opportunity for an XTR Hall of Fame alike thing for
MAX Rally).<P>

The game will contain six characters in all for you to choose from, each of
these charactors have there own uniqie driving attributes - so you can pick the
driver that suits your particular style.<P>

The game will also contain some excellent music.  Other features that the game
boasts includes:- HD installable, many AGA enhancements, 360° Jumps, Turbos,
different surfaces and much, much more.<P>

The game, when released, will retail for £14.99 and will be available directly
from the authors only.  It will require any Amiga with 1.5Mb memory and will
come on 2 disks.<P>

For any questions about the game don't hesitate to contact the authors at:-<P>
