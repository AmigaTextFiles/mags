<P>For Immediate Release

<P>ImageFX for your Amiga Holidays!

<P>Look for ImageFX available at your local dealer or from Software Hut and
Safe Harbor this holiday season.  You'll find their incredible deals on
ImageFX, the Amiga and Video Toaster/Flyer's top-rated image editing and
special effects package, as well as a great price on Aladdin 4D.
Aladdin 4D, our cool new 3D modeling, rendering, and animation package,
is available for less than $130 when purchased with ImageFX or any other
item!

Hut 1-800-932-6442<br>

<P>Check also for Catalyzer for ImageFX - the all new tutorial video from
Legacy Maker, Inc. that shows you how to use ImageFX's powerful region
tools, text, and how to animate effects like warps, swirls, distortions
and lightning!  Catalyzer is an absolute must for learning advanced
animation and special effects techniques with ImageFX.

<P>If you're a video professional or hobbyist you should also look into the
VisualFX series from Visual Inspirations.  VisualFX puts an automated
front end on ImageFX that is a completely visual (hence the name)
interface to the power of ImageFX.  Combine VisualFX with ImageFX and
you will instantly be creating complex transitions and effects without
any detailed knowledge of ImageFX!

holiday season to everyone!
