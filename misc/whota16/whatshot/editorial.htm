Hi,
<p>
This issue's editorial for the What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine, concentrates on a 
lot of things, including the release of Index Information's new Amiga Compatibles, 
the <A HREF="access.htm">Access</A> and the <A 
HREF="boxer.htm">Boxer</A>, with exclusive articles on both them appearing 
in this issue with images.  And with the release of the Boxer and the Access, I can't 
wait to see Index Information's InsideOut which nothing has been heard about this 
for some time and is there answer to a next generation Amiga.  But, yet again, 
Foundation gets a mention in this issue in the <A HREF="nib.htm">News In Brief 
</A> as does OnEscapee, of which nothing has been heard about for a while now.
<p>
What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine can still be found on the web, at: <p> <A 
HREF="http://www.sonic.net/~alanwall/whota/index.html">http://www.sonic.net/~al
anwall/whota/index.html</A>.  
<p>
This issue contains a <A HREF="survey.htm">survey</A>, which I hope you'll 
fill in and send back to me as I was asked by Geosync Media before whota15, to 
provide information of the specifications of the Amigas that you're using currently.  
So far there have been some responses, but I'm including the survey in this issue in 
the hope that more people will respond to it, and as always, the survey is also 
available at the web site.
<p>
This issue's biggest article must be <A HREF="amiquake.htm">ClickBOOM 
Statement On Quake Situation</A>, with the <A HREF=sadeness.htm">Sadeness 
Software signs Forgotten Forever and Dafel:Bloodline!</A>articles and the Alive 
MediaSoft articles, <A HREF="alivegilbert.htm">Alive MediaSoft Sign Up Gilbert 
Goodmate</A> and <A HREF="nib.htm">Alive MediaSoft To Publish Goblin 
Tanks</A> being of interest as well.
<p>
Forgotten Forever, the Amiga's answer to Command & Conquer on the PC is also 
mentioned in the <A HREF="ffs1.htm">Forgotten Forever - New 
Screenshots</A> article and the <A HREF="hardtarget1.htm">New Screenshots 
of Hard Target</A> article are definitely worth a look as well.
<P>
Now this month's, Site Of The Month is <A HREF="http://www.cu-
amiga.co.uk">CU-Amiga</A>, which at the moment has got a couple of surveys 
on it, for you to fill in and is always worth a visit. 
<P>
Check out <A HREF="links.htm">Links</A> for the latest additions to my Links 
Section.
