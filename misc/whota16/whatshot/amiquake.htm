<img src=images/quake.jpg alt="Quake" WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=238 
align=right>There 
have been many rumours that Quake was going to hit the Amiga, and ClickBOOM 
were planning to do the port.  ClickBOOM have now issued a statement on the 
Quake situation stating that they are in talks with ID Software about a port.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately ClickBOOM have been beseiged by E-mails and telephone calls about 
Quake and ClickBOOM can not handle the amount they are getting and have called 
on Amiga Owners to stay calm and stop sending e-mails to them.  ClickBOOM have 
promised that they will reveal whether they will be allowed to port Quake and for 
the time being Amiga owners must wait.  Please stop sending ClickBOOM e-mails 
about Quake.
<p>
ClickBOOM's full statement is below:-
<p>
The Amiga Quake rumor has completely gotten out of hand - since Computer '97 
show in Cologne, some ten days ago, we have received well over a thousand email 
letters and numerous telephone calls. They all had the same question: "Is it true 
that clickBOOM will be releasing Quake for the Amiga?" 
<br>
<br>
We had quite a few inquires of this nature even before Computer '97, but we 
basically decided not to address any of them. At the show, however, the word 
spread quickly among Amiga enthusiasts, and the electronic siege on clickBOOM 
started. We hoped it would end shortly after. It didn't. On the contrary, the word 
had spread even faster over the Internet. 
<br>
<br>
We would like to take this opportunity to apologize to all users who wrote to us 
(some even five times) and never got an answer. 
<br>
<br>
"So, what is the answer?" , you are asking. 
<br>
<br>
We do not have a definite answer yet. However, it is true that we are in talks with 
Id Software to legalize this unbelievable action game for the Amiga. The news will 
be posted to our site as soon as everything is finalized (positive or negative). 
<br>
<br>
The reason we are posting this "news" is because we could not ignore your letters 
any more. While we have the obligation to answer, as you can see, the final answer 
is still not here. Therefore, we would kindly ask of you to just hold on with your 
barrage of email until the final news. We can not cope with such amount of letters, 
especially when we do not have the real answer. 
<br>
<br>
We hope to have more for you very soon. 
<br>
<br>
Best regards, 
<br>
clickBOOM
