hard on this title, with new screenshots revealing that much of this work at the 
moment is aimed at getting the locations to look realistic to create a atmosphere 
for what will be full of action.  Vulcan Software have even got a Light Gun in 
development which will work in conjunction with Hard Target, something I will be 
peculiarly interested in trying out.
