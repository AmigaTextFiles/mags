<P><b>Myst</b><br>
The best selling game of all times

<P>After a long period of waiting Myst, the mystery adventure, is now available
for the Amiga. The game is available completely in english, so package,
manual, all menus and the speech are completely in english.

<P>The CyberGraphX version is running in 24Bit mode with 16 million colours.

<P>We apologize, but to the delay of PPC availability, we were unable to have
a PPC optimized Myst for this time. An upgrade will be available for
download from Aminet.

<P>Myst CD also contains a 14 minute self-contained QuickTime movie "Making 
of
Myst", where authors take you behind the scenes of making of this
magnificent game!

<P>Myst uses AHI sound system by Martin Blom. The latest full version is
provided on the CD. You do not have to install AHI, Myst will simply
utilize it from a CD if it is not already installed on your HD. (although
it is not necessary to install it, we recommend you do it for your everyday
use, as more and more software uses it).

<P>Further important features of Myst:

<ul>
<li> 100% OS friendly
<li> fully multitasking
<li> high-res graphics (640x400, 256 colours minimum)
</ul>

<P>Myst installation program allows you to choose how much data you want to
install to hard drive. The more you install to HD, the faster access Myst
will have to those files, therefore the faster it will run (this is
especially usefull if you have a slow CD or CPU).

<P>Installation possibilities:

<ul>
<li> 5Mb will only install the code and AHI
<li> 40Mb will install all the sounds
<li> 270Mb installs all the gfx
<li> 310Mb installs all the gfx+sound
</ul>

<P>Minimum technical requirements for AGA-Amigas:
68020, CD-ROM drive (2x), 8MB RAM, 5MB free on harddisk.<br>
Minimum technical requirements for Amigas with graphics board 
(CyberGraphX):<br>
68020, CD-ROM drive (2x), 8MB RAM, 5MB free on harddisk.<br>

<P>Optimum technical requirements for AGA-Amigas:<br>
68060, CD-ROM drive (12x), 16MB RAM, 100MB free on harddisk.<br>
Optimum technical requirements for Amigas with graphics board 
(CyberGraphX)::<br>

<b>Uropa 2</b><br>
Strategy and Action in 3D<br>

<P>Uropa2 is a combination of 3D isometric and 3D light sourced vector game
which is based on the moon of Uropa. Battle the evil Kapones and seek out
the mastermind of their operations!

<P>Background:
<P>During the interstellar wars against the alien invasion forces, a vast
majority of earths colonies sustained major damage to their structures and
defence systems. The invasion force was repelled at great human loss, the
earth colonies were slow to develop to their former civilized position.

<P>To prevent such wide spread destruction from being forced upon the Earth
colonies, they banded together with mother Earth to form a peace keeping
force. This peace keeping force is known as Intercorp.

<P>Intercorp is the military arm of the Earth Colonies and is funded by a user
pay policy. Any action that Intercorp engages in, is paid for by the colony
or colonies making the request.

<P>Intercorp is structured into three main Task Forces. The Central Task Force is
made up of Humans and Intelligent droids known as Tekites. The Humans are the
command and both Humans and Tekites provide the main attack and counter attack
forces of Intercorp. The Key Task Force is made up of intelligent droids known
as Kapones. The Kapones provide ongoing defence at major or important
installations owned by the Earth colonies. The third section is the Centurion
Task Force. It numbers 100 of the elite Tekites. You are the newest addition
to the Centurion Taskforce.

<P>The Centurions are a covert strike force which are mainly used in covert
intelligence operations or tactical strikes against enemy installations
prior to the Central Task Force arrival.

<P>The colony of Uropa2 is based on a small moon revolving around the planet 
of
Jupiter, at one time known as Europa. The moon was almost destroyed during the
wars, but due to the rich resources on the moon, the colonists re-built the
moon and renamed it Uropa2. The moon is situated on the outer reaches of the
Earth controlling zone and because of its strategic position, has been set up
as a  major link in communications and detection of hostile fleets entering
the zone.

<P>There are twelve bases, scattered across Uropa2 , which are networked
together providing a unique system of integration. Each base is capable of
space and sub-space surveillance at different detection levels. Only the
central communication base, Castalia, is capable of direct contact with
Intercorp.

<P>Uropa2 detection systems were placed under the control of human colonists.
These colonists have no weapons or defence training and as a result of
their peaceful nature, the protection of the colony was charged to Key
Task Force of Intercorp.

<P>From suspected reasons of greed, the Key Task Force on Uropa2 has rebelled
against Intercorp and has gained command of the moon. Communications with
the moon have ceased and the fate of the colonists is unknown. The Kapones
are acting as mercenaries for one of Intercorps interstellar enemies and
have been tasked with the destruction of Uropa2.

<P>Technical background:
<ul>
<li> 10 gigantic, strategy based missions
<li> 3D isometric Action adventure
<li> 3D vector light-sourced locaions
<li> Myriads of tactical problems to solve
