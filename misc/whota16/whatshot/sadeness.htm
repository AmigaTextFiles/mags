<A HREF="http://www.sadeness.demon.co.uk/">Sadeness Software</a> have 
signed 2 more games to their publishing
label, the first, for those of you who haven't seen it is <i>Forgotten
Forever</i>, is a realtime strategy war game like <i>Dune II</i> or 
<i>Command &amp; Conquer</i>.
Dune II was released on Amiga and was the best realtime strategy war game
ever. Some time later Command & Conquer was born, but unfortunately it was
PC only.  At last we have the answer for Amiga owners.

<P>The Second of their new signings is a superb RPG called 
<i>Dafel:Bloodline</i>,
Dafel:Blodline (originally known as <i>Child of Darkness</i>), mixes the old 
<i>Zelda</i>
type game to modern Beat-em-ups with good old RPG characters, speech puzzles
thrown in for good measure. The game runs on any AMIGA with AGA chipset
displaying
the graphics in glorious 128 colours. All the characters in the game are
controlled by sophisticated AI routines, so the game will always play
differently, even if you completed it once before.

<P>Not forgetting, Sadeness Software have already signed the fantastic 
<i>Foundation</i>
and <i>onEscapee</i>, they are certainly going strong in the publishing 
industry.
onEscapee will be released just in time for Christmas, although Foundation
will
not be ready until Jan/Feb 98.

<P>They have said to be 95% of completing the signing of what they said is one
of the most advanced Amiga games they have seen, but will not as yet release
anymore information until things have been finalised.
