<b>STORY</b>

<P>Greek Mythology informs us that the King of Minos imposed an annual
tribute for 6 girls to be shipped to Crete and thrown as food to the
hideous creature called the Minotuar who resides in a vast magical
labyrinth in Athens.
<P>In this elaborate adventure game you play the part of Theseus who is
responsible for taking the poor girls to their death, however you have
another plan in mind. To break this revolting tradition and to ensure no
more innocent victims need to face this destiny it is up to you to solve
the complex puzzles and mysteries of the Labyrinth and eventually
destroy the Minotaur as well as locating all the girls that have been
imprisoned and getting them out safely. The Final Odyssey combines logic
puzzle solving with plenty of action and strategy, you will be armed
with the most sophisticated weaponry and be thrown into a mind melting
logical world of traps, enemies, puzzles and mini quests. The unique
dungeon designs create constantly changing levels in gloriously animated
splendour coupled with true 3d sound effects which all help to create a
world that is very hard to leave.
