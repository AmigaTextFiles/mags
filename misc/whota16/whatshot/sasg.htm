SASG WISHES YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS!<br>
SASG WEBSITE HAS BEATEN 200,000 HITMARK!

<P>
Rituals are more important in our days than we realize since we live in
such a high-paced, hectic world.  Events like Christmas remind us to stop
for a moment and think about the past, what has happened since then, think
about ourselves.  And soon everybody realizes that without the help of some
special people around them they would be nowhere.  Sure, you might argue
that you don't need any events to remind you to reflect upon your life and
show that you care for others.  Well, many people do.  After all it's
positive that we have these rituals, since without them most of us would
probably forget to stop for a moment.

<P>
We at <A HREF="http://www.sasg.com/index.html">SASG</a> would like to 
stop for a moment and express our gratitude to
everybody for supporting our project in the past and thus helping SASG to
make the Amiga a better place to stay with. <B>You showed us that you
cared...  Thank you!</B>

<P>
And we are celebrating another event:  Our SASG website has reached and
beaten the magical barrier of 200,000 individual users attending our online
services after just 15 months!  If this should speak for the popularity and
success of SASG and our products, we really appreciate it.  We thank
everybody who visited our website and helped to make it so popular.  Thank

<P><b>About SASG (Standardized Amiga Shareware Group)</b>
<P>
SASG is now supporting the Amiga and its community for almost 4 years!
SASG was founded in May 1994.  Most Amiga users will remember this time as
the downfall of Commodore.  SASG was born out of this crisis since we
wanted to show our solidarity with the Amiga and its users worldwide for we
knew that the liquidation of Commodore would not simultaneously mean the
downfall of the Amiga computer.  After almost 4 years we can proudly say
that our decisions and feelings were right on this matter.  It was good to
support the Amiga and its users by keeping this platform strong and
flourishing.
