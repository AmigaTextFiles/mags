<P>
The Amiga Apache http server project is happy to announce the new
1.3b3 release of the professional Apache webserver. It is available
for download at: <A 
HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~albertv/apache/index.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~albe
rtv/apache/index.html</A>

<P>The Amiga Apache webserver is a port of the professional Apache webserver,
used by more than 40% of all servers on the Internet. Amiga Apache is
compatible with the original Unix Apache and uses the same configuration
files and uses the same options.

<P>The Amiga Apache webserver is enhanced with the ability to execute AREXX
scripts (allthough it has no Arexx port of its own). This means that
Amiga programs can interface with the server for in- and output. For example,
it is possible and easy to connect a database program with Arexx support
to Apache with the help of AREXX scripts.

<P>The Amiga Apache http server project is runned by Jeff Shepherd who has
made the port, Bert Vortman, maintainer of the Amiga Apache binary & source
distribution, the homepage and the documentation and Brett Burridge who
maintains the FAQ, Thorsten Hiddessen, Robert Ramiega, Eirik Synnes,
Hans de Groot and Per-Olof Yliniemi who are running a mirror site and
many beta-testers.

<P>There are 2 mailinglists available: apache-users for contact between
Amiga apache users and apache-l for betatesters. Send a mail to:


<DIR>           <A 
HREF="mailto:majordomo@spinnewiel.xs4all.nl">majordomo@spinnewiel.xs4all.nl
</A></DIR>

with the message:

<DIR>           subscribe apache-users</DIR>

<P>The mailinglists are running on an Amiga that is NOT connected 24h a day
so expect some delay. The mailinglists are runned by the majordomo
mailinglist software.

<P>Bert Vortman, maintainer of the Apache Homepage.


<P>Here is a selection of a list of new features that Amiga Apache supports:
(more info at the Amiga Apache homepage (<A 
HREF="http://www.dsdelft.nl/~apache/">http://www.dsdelft.nl/~apache/</A>).


<P>Amiga Apache HTTP Server Version 1.3

<DIR>                        <b>Selection of new features.</b></DIR>

<ul>
<li> Optional «Spelling Correction» module added to distribution
     This optional module corrects frequently occurring spelling errors in
     document names requested from the server. This includes the correction
     of miscapitalized requests (as was available in a separately available
     mod_speling module as of Apache 1.1 already) but extends spelling
     correction to single inserted, omitted, transposed or mistyped
     characters. This catches the majority of mistyped requests. To make use
     of this module, it must be enabled in the server's Configuration file,
     and the CheckSpelling directive must be set to on.
<li> Enhanced Conditional Setting of Environment Variables
     The BrowserMatch* directives of Apache 1.2 have been joined by some more
     powerful brethren: SetEnvIf and SetEnvIfNoCase. These allow you to set
     environment variables for server and CGI use based upon all sorts of
     attributes of the request.
<li> Better Logging for Proxy Connect Errors
     In Apache 1.2 and earlier, when the proxy had difficulty connecting to a
     system it would log the error but no details. It now includes the IP
     address and port to which it couldn't connect.
<li> Enhanced SSI String Comparisons
     The string-based server-side include (SSI) flow-control directives
     provided by mod_include now include comparison for less-than (<),
     less-than-or-equal (<=), greater-than (>), and greater-than-or-equal
     (>=). Previously comparisons could only be made for equality or
     inequality.
<li> Sortable Directory Listings
     If a directory listing is displayed using FancyIndexing, clicking on a
     column title will now sort the listing in order by the values in that
     column. Selecting the column repeatedly will toggle between ascending
     and descending order. This feature can be disabled with the
     SuppressColumnSorting IndexOptions keyword.
<li> New "Magic" MIME-typing module
     A new module, the optional mod_mime_magic, has been added. It uses
     "magic numbers" and other hints from a file's contents to figure out
     what the contents are. It then uses this information to set the file's
     media type, if it cannot be determined by the file's extension.
<li> Support for Directory Icon Sizing
     The mod_autoindex module provides listings of directory contents when
     appropriate. If the FancyIndexing option is enabled, each file in the
     list is preceded by an icon representing the content type. In earlier
     versions of Apache, the HTML IMG tags for these icons weren't sized, so
     the browser had to wait until the images were loaded before it could lay
     out the page. With 1.3, the IndexOptions directive has two new keywords
     which allow you to control whether pre-sized IMG tags are used. This can
     substantially speed up the display of large directory listings.
<li> NoProxy and ProxyDomain directives added to proxy, useful for intranets.
<li> AddModuleInfo directive added to mod_info
     Allows additional information to be listed along with a specified
     module.
<li> Include directive
     The Include directive includes other config files immediately at that
     point in parsing.
<li> Improved HTTP/1.1-style Virtual Hosts
     The new NameVirtualHost directive is used to list IP address:port pairs
     on which HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting occurs. This is vhosting based
     on the Host: header from the client. Previously this address was
     implicitly the same as the "main address" of the machine, and this
     caused no end of problems for users, and was not powerful enough. Please
     see the Apache Virtual Host documentation for further details on
     configuration.
<li> Year-2000 Improvements
     The default timefmt string used by mod_include has been modified to
     display the year using four digits rather than the two-digit format used
     previously. The mod_autoindex module has also been modified to display
     years using four digits in FancyIndexed directory listings.
