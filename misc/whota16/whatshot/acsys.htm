Unique are developing a shoot'em up game inspired by the classic Turrican called 
ACSYS.
<br>
<br>
<img src=images/ac01.jpg alt="ACSYS" align=right>The story is set in the year 
of 2074 
and mankind is exploring other worlds in deep space, the reconaissance cruiser 
XPOSE discovers a strange structure on the 5th moon of Scarus.  They send down a 
team to check it out but they never return and so the first deployment of A.C.SYS 
(Autonomous Cybernetic System), a special droid constructed and programed for 
crisis areas is used.  It's objective consists of rescuing all the survivors and to 
eliminate all forms of aggressive enemies.  That means it's time for you take 
control.
<br>
<br>
<img src=images/ac01.gif alt="ACSYS" align=right>There will be up to six 
different 
weapons, some upgradeable with two weapons being able to be carried 
simulaneously.  It'll have multidirectional parallax scrolling and 360° shooting in 
every position with plenty of intelligent enemies to content with.  ACSYS will also 
have special music and soundFX with animated sequences between levels.
