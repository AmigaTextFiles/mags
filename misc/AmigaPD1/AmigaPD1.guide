    Hello! And Welcome to the first Best of Amiga PD Magazine!!!!
 I'll Tell you I'm a little enthusiastic about it as I am, the Amiga
 PD community is large.  Many, many private Amiga developers are out
 making quality software for you!  But how do you know what is right
 for you? Well I am hoping this Magazine can help you.  As there are
 many online magazine such as Amiga Report, and Amiga Link they do
 lack reviews on the PD material coming out every month.  We are
 devoted to geting reviews and info on as much of a given months
 files posted to Aminet.  If me and my Co-Editor Brett Williams have
 to do it all on our own fine.  If we get some devoted souls who
 give us a hand as to not miss any of that great software then that
 would be great too!  So take a look at our first issue and let me
 or Brett know what you think at:

 roy@ramiga.cts.com or bryson@schotzi.cts.com

    Possible future idea's are Interviews with some of these great
 Authors about there programs and what they are doing to enhance and
 update these programs.  If any of you our readers are authors please
 E-mail me at roy@ramiga.cts.com and maybe we can try this idea of
 mine.

 Also note, I want your opinons, I'm releasing this mag kinda bare
 bones to get feedback.  If you hate this idea and think we don't
 need another online magazine then tell me, if you like this idea
 then help me out or encourage me! :)

 Thanks Roy (AK)

    A lot of games won't run on the workbench of a A3000/16Mhz using the Retina
    Z2, but this one does.  "Snake Bite" has been around since the days of the
    Commodore 64 and it was so much fun back then that it has survived the
    years. This is a great little version that is simple, smooth and very fast.
    It is easy to control, looks great on the workbench, comes with English,
    German and French versions.  It is easy to get addicted to this game and
    blow many hours away unnoticed.  It keeps a high scores log so you can
    compare yourself to your friends and vice versa.

    This is a great Amiga version of MineSweeper.  It looks good on a high
    resolution workbench screen and plays very fast.  The buttons are large
    enough to allow for easy clicking and it keeps track of the best times
    for the different level.  I would say this is the best Minesweeper clone
    for the Amiga to date.

    CLChat is a great Multi-user chat program.  It comes with a server
    and a client.  You may chose to install the server or not.  There
    are many public servers available on the net already so it is not
    entirely nessary.

    The clchat server is much like an irc server would be except not
    as complicated.  A more simpler version with not as many commands
    and such.  With the ability of multiple channels, baning, private
    messaging and a dcc like file sending protocal make all the most
    convient things of the irc avialable.  Why use CLChat?  Well unlike
    the irc there is not lagg or splits which makes for great uninterupted
    converstaions.

    The clchat client is much like the irc client Grapevine.  The whole
    thing is done in MUI, but for those who hate MUI you must try this
    program as the author does very well with MUI.  With keyboard short
    cuts, and many config options make it pleasurable to use.  A not as
    nice but usalbe Windows version is avaialbe for use on ibm PC's.

    This is an exceptional program!  It is truely a blast.  It has
    no real practical use except fun.  It will use graphic boards,
    AGA or just plain ECS if that is all ya got.  Either way it is
    fun!  You have a canvas before you that what you pait shows up
    on the other persons canvas.

    To top it all off this program has a nice, well documented ARexx
    port.  Because of this you can have scripts that do all kinds of
    things if you are fluient in ARexx that is.  It comes with a few
    ARexx programs already including a Chess Game!  The chess game
    works well and would be quite speedy on any Amiga, and a blast
    to play with friends around the globe.

    I found this mod player to be a very powerfull easy to use player.
    It support many diffrent kinds of mod formats.  It is equiped with the
    power to play packed mods of all sorts, from xpk packed ones to lha'd
    files!

    I found the Favorite Song System to be one of the most unique options
    of a mod player I've seen.  It keeps a list of the top 10 played mods
    and constantly updates, these top 10 are your favorite mods and you
    can have it play your favorite mods any time you'd like!  Also unique
    to this modplayer is the ability to save instraments out of a mod into
    a sound file.  Probably the most usfull out of all the features this
    mod player has is it's ability to play mods from Fast Memory! Yes it
    does not need to use your valuable chip memory, leaving more ram for
    you to contin your your work as you listen.

 @{fg shine}Documentation@{fg text}

   The documentation is clear and concise, and very detailed.  The only draw
   back in it is that the author makes referance to some functions inthe
   configuration program that are not named the same as they are in the
   documentation (ie. the documentation refers to a RTPatch function while
   the configuration program calls it Reqtools Patch), a little bit of
   brainpower has to be used to figure it out.

 @{fg shine}Known Bugs@{fg text}

   Pointerblanker - It doesn't work right on some GFX-Board WBEmus
                    (e.g. Retina)


 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

   By combining a multitude of commodities into a single package this program
   offers a great deal of speed and versatility.  The program runs flawlessly
   and is very easy to install.  There are some functions that this program
   provides that I have not seen available anywhere else, such as:

   AssignWedge - This nice feature enhances the "Please insert ??? in any
                 drive" requester so know you are able to Assign (Requester
                 for selection), Mount (Tries to mount the requested device),
                 Deny (allways cancels the requester before popups it at any
                 time)

   ScreenActivation - If a new screen comes to front, it will always be
                      activated. The last time activated Window will be, of
                      course, activated.

   Toolalias - Here you can exchange the Icon-Defaulttool. Give a pattern and
               the new command. (e.g. more to c:ppmore)

   Just to name a few...


   When it comes to commodities and MCP is the only commodity you REALLY
   need...
