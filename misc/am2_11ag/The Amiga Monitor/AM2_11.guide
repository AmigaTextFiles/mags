You can have The Amiga Monitor delivered to you via e-mail, or you can be notified when a new issue is available. There are currently four lists; send e-mail to @{U}mikewebb@csi.com@{UU} (please check the Please check @{U}The AM Link Redirection Page (http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html)@{UU} for an up-to-date e-mail address first if possible, but otherwise use this address) in which you specify the list(s) you would like to join (or leave):


* @{B}HTML LhA:@{UB} HTML-format files archived with LhA

* @{B}HTML ZIP:@{UB} HTML-format files archived with ZIP

* @{B}AmigaGuide LhA:@{UB} AmigaGuide-format files archived with LhA (as of this writing, there is a very significant backlog of issues needing to be converted from HTML to AmigaGuide, and new issues have not been available in AmigaGuide for some time; however, this is a high-priority problem and will be addressed as soon as time and resources permit)

* @{B}New issue notification of availability:@{UB} Via this list, we send out a simple, small notification that a new issue has been made available in any format. It allows readers to stay up-to-date with AM without having to download entire archives as e-mail attachments.


If we successfully receive and process your request, you will receive notification that you have been added to a list. If you do not receive a response within two weeks, please check to see that your correct e-mail address is included with the message, and resend your request.




Our Publisher sends the AM archives out through his mailbox enough times each month without it coming in several times as well. Please make his life a little easier, and do your best to prevent bouncebacks:

* Please notify us if your e-mail address changes.

* Also, please be certain that your provider can handle fairly large attached files. The AM archives generally range in size from 50 kB to 500 kB. We can tolerate it if you have problems with some of the larger ones, but if there are consistent problems with smaller archives, we will have to move you to the Notification List.

Depending on the error message specified in the bounced-back message, we may automatically remove an address from a list upon receiving a bounceback.

@NODE redir "About AM Link Redirection"
@{U}                                                                            @{UU}

After we had been publishing The Amiga Monitor for some time, a fundamental problem with magazines became apparent.

It may not be obvious in the "here and now," but old issues of magazines remain exactly the way they are after publication. They are not updated, errors are not fixed, etc. This is especially true of an online magazine, which anybody can stumble upon long after it was created. Results can include invalid e-mail addresses and broken hypertext links.

In order to minimize this problem, beginning with the February 1998 (Volume 2 Issue 7) issue of The Amiga Monitor, we have assembled a central "switching station," if you will, to which this, and all future issues of AM, should refer. In theory, this station will remain in place indefinitely, and continue to provide up-to-date e-mail addresses equally indefinitely.

As publisher, I have chosen my web site, @{U}The Webb Site, ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/@{UU}, as host.




                          @{B}@{U}AM Link Redirection Page@{UB}@{UU}

The AM Link Redirection Page will exist at the URL @{U}http://ourworld.compuserve.com/HomePages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html@{UU}. There, you should be able to find contact information for people associated with The Amiga Monitor, e-mail addresses for various AM departments or services, and links to AM-affiliated sites.




                                @{B}@{U}Limitations@{UB}@{UU}

The AM Link Redirection Page will exist at @{U}http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html@{UU} for as long as I retain my CompuServe account. I intend to do so more or less indefinitely, but there is no guarantee, and CompuServe itself may one day cease to exist. However, this is the best solution available given the circumstances at hand, and should greatly facilitate any needed future admiministrative changes at AM.

@{U}                                                                            @{UU}

The Amiga Monitor is always looking for new writers.

If you would like to write for AM, you can simply send a completed article to us at @{U}mikewebb@csi.com@{UU} (please check the @{U}AM Link Redirection Page (http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html)@{UU} for an up-to-date e-mail address first if possible, but otherwise use this address). Please note that it is at the discretion of the AM Editorial Staff as to whether articles will be published, and we reserve the right to make or request revisions. If we do publish your article, we will list you by name and e-mail address (and web site if provided) as a Contributing Writer in the issue in which your article is published, unless you request to remain anonymous.

If, however, you would like to contact us ahead of time to discuss one or more articles you would like to write (if, for instance, you wish to clear a topic with us before doing the writing, or if you are interested in earning a more permanent position on the staff list), please contact us at @{U}kylewebb@aol.com@{UU} (please check the @{U}AM Link Redirection Page (http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html)@{UU} for an up-to-date e-mail address first if possible, but otherwise use this address).




                         @{B}Become an AM Staff Member@{UB}

As noted above, non-staff members who write for AM are listed as Contributing Writers in the issues in which their work appears. However, people who work in the capacity of Contributing Writers on a regular basis can earn more permanent listings as Staff Writers, who are listed in every issue. If you are interested in this, feel free to contact us as listed above.

But you may also feel free to suggest an entirely new type of staff position you would be willing to fill. If we don't have a particular position on the staff, more likely it is due to resource limitations than to a conscious decision to exclude that position. Again, contact us as listed above if you are interested.

Either way, however, please note that being an AM Staff Member, while not a huge commitment, is also not a commitment to be taken lightly. Staff Writers are expected to produce on a regular basis, at least three times per year. Contributing Editors are expected to contribute something almost every month. Please be sure you can live up to this if you want to become a member of the staff.




                    @{B}@{I}A few notes on article submission...@{UI}@{UB}

* Articles should be written in English.
* Articles should be sent in ASCII format; HTML tags are permissible (but please limit yourself to rudimentary tags, such as text styles, (un)ordered lists, links, text alignments, etc.).
* Images are permissible, and in fact welcomed, as judicious use of graphics can greatly increase the quality of an article. If you do choose to include images, please use IFF, JPEG, or GIF format, and archive your entire article with LhA, LZH, or LZX.
* Personal e-mail signatures, URL's, etc. are permitted to be included in an article.
* Once sent to us, your writing becomes public domain under the @{"AM Reprint Policy" LINK reprint} unless you explicitly request otherwise.
* We often count on you to come up with specific ideas for articles. Although you are welcome to get in contact with us simply to announce your interest in writing for us, please do not be surprised if we don't have any specific "assignments" for you right away. It is generally best if those who wish to write know exactly what they want to write about.

And lastly, again,

* It is ultimately at the discretion of the staff of The Amiga Monitor as to whether articles will be published.

The Amiga Monitor is published monthly online by Excelsior Digital Publishing, © 1996-1998.

The Amiga Monitor and Excelsior Digital Publishing are based in Binghamton, New York, USA.

The Amiga Monitor is created monthly in HTML format, and then translated into AmigaGuide format. The HTML version is posted in LhA and ZIP archive formats, while the AmigaGuide version is posted in LhA archive format only.

The HTML version of The Amiga Monitor requires a tables-supporting web browser to render the HTML properly; however, it should be readable with other browsers. The HTML code in The Amiga Monitor is currently developed primarily with CygnusEd and IBrowse (@{U}http://www.omnipresence.com/ibrowse/@{UU}) on the Amiga.

The AmigaGuide version of The Amiga Monitor uses a 200-pixel-wide screen with the Topaz 8 font in the AmigaOS 3.1 version of MultiView as its base reference configuration. It should therefore be readable under most, if not all, configurations, although centered text will probably not look correct under configurations besides the base reference configuration.

I had a dream the other night. Went like this.

Checkbook in hand, I finally reached the head of the long line and was ready to buy my brand new state-of-the-art Amiga 5000. It had been a long time coming and my 4-6 year old Amigas were badly in need of replacement. The salesclerk cleared his throat, put on his best "bait and switch" face and said:

"Sir, we've had some unavoidable delays in production. There will be an Amiga Intel-based machine maybe in the next six months, but for developers only....and there might be a splendid mystery computer around the turn of the century but it may not run your existing software or hardware peripherals. The PPC Amigas that we announced as the platform of the future fell victim to a 'change of plans' and we are leaving that for the gullible Europeans to fight over."

"However," he continued, "we are able at the present time to offer our loyal Amiga customers a splendid line of Amiga-related items that will brighten up your computing life! We've got POSTERS, we've got COFFEE MUGS, we've got VIDEOTAPES of all the recent Amiga non-events, we've got BOING SHOES and BOING CARS. We even have the AMIGA THEME SONG on a CD for your listening and dancing pleasure! How many would you like to order, sir?"

At that point I awoke. I was still hungry but there was no food so I decided to head over to the forum to catch the latest circus being offered by the benevolent Emperors.

                THE FUTURE OF AMIGA AND CURRENT DECISIONS...

Hello!

I wasn't going to write so much, but since you said so many things I didn't agree with this is going to be a very long document, I'm sorry for that!

First of all, the Amiga is owned by Amiga Inc., not Gateway. This simple fact seems to elude most people's perceptions of what is really going on with the Amiga. Gateway simply looks at the business plan and approve or disapprove depending on the merits of the business plan, that is all. No love or hate towards the Amiga. The "love" for the Amiga comes from the people from Amiga Inc. who truly care about the Amiga spirit.

Second, if you (or anybody) can't see the merits of an open platform, then you haven't looked around to see what works and what doesn't work in the computing business. You can have it one way or the other, but not both! You either produce your own computers, or let somebody else do it for you. The stories of IBM and Apple are the perfect examples of the merits and disadvantages of both strategies. Recently Apple learned first hand this lesson. You can't license your technology, and at the same time try to compete with the same people you have licenses with. It just doesn't work!

The problem is that you seem to suggest that producing and resurrecting the current Amiga technology will save the Amiga, when in fact Amiga Inc. (just like all of us who had to switch platforms to survive) know that this would be a waist of time and money. Only NEW technology can save the Amiga. I know many people can't see this, either because they are trying to protect their current investment or they just can't see the reality of the computing market, but current Amiga technology CAN NOT save the Amiga.

And please realize, this includes PPC. People just can't seem to understand that to re-write the Amiga Kernel (Intuition) would take YEARS!!! Yes, YEARS!!! I keep hearing all this messages about Phase 5 and how they have sustained the Amiga with PPC, well in case you didn't noticed, those PPC cards are NOT Amiga compatible. They require a different object format and do not support the basic elements of Intuition like dynamic libraries and other multitasking timing elements are completely different.

YES! They changed their minds! Is that so hard to accept. They were (and still are) in a process of R&D evaluating different technologies to incorporate or base future Amigas on. Jeff said it several times, many plans where shown to Gateway until the final decision was made. I'm sure PPC was an option at one time, but the current direction seems to be better for performance and price ratio.

The only problem is that ZorroIV doesn't exist. And if it was developed it would take at least a year to develop and integrate to the current Amiga OS. Then again the OS would have to be rewritten, at least partially, to accommodate the new timing issues, so why not adopt the new BX 100Mhz PCI bus? Already developed, twice as fast as Zorro, and with thousands of available peripherals available, into the new Amiga and develop it along with the new Amiga OS. Doesn't that make more sense?

I guess you see my point after all...   :)

This are very good concerns that we all share. I think the time frame is possible since the Kernel will be an established Kernel with all the functionality we always wanted in Intuition. And if Amiga Inc. chooses the Be Kernel, it even includes libraries and data types just like the Amiga OS. The operating system can be written fairly quick once the Kernel is adopted finished.

Well, what incentive is there now to use Amigas besides already owning one? Amiga users are going to start to realize that the future of the Amiga will be very different than what it is now. The OS will be more portable so I'm almost sure we will some day see Amiga OS running in many different hardware. I do agree there are some features that make the Amiga unique, Low Overhead, OS Speed etc., and those should be maintain.

Unfortunately, like I mentioned before, to re-write and improve Intuition with all the features a modern (futuristic) OS should have (memory protection, multiprocessing, hardware independence, scalability) will take YEARS and thousands of man hours, unlike what most people (including you) think. So it would actually be MORE expensive and it would take longer to re-write Intuition than aquire other modern Kernel. You make it sound so simple, when in fact it is tremendously complicated! Most people don't know that the Kernel has almost NOTHING to do with the look of the OS and how it behaves. You could, if you wanted, write Workbench 3.1 over the Be Kernel, but why? :)

Allow me to disagree. We need to move forward. And bringing the current Amiga OS (as it is now) with us would be more of an anchor than help. If you want to get stuck with a blotted, backwards compatible, Amiga98 OS then keep complaining about the future of the Amiga, as long as you know what you are asking for, you have the right to ask for it.

I do understand that many people are angry about this and it is understandable, but you can't put all the blame on Amiga Inc. Phase 5 decided, on it's won, that the future of the Amiga was going to be PPC. The Amiga community wasn't asked about it. Way before there was any talk about PPC at Amiga Inc., Phase 5 was planning to take over the Amiga community by developing it's own PPC based machine (A/Box) and OS to support this machine. Their intentions all along (until Amiga Inc. showed up) were to migrate to PPC (not necessarily) Amiga and bring as many Amiga users along as possible with an "Amiga like" OS. They said it themselves. Very nobel effort, but they came WAY short in 4 years of development.

Amiga Inc. has NO obligation to follow a path set by another company, specially since there are other options much more appealing for the future of the Amiga. Jeff knew this was going to be very tough for many people, that's why he said at St. Louis that there are good times ahead but also bad times for many Amiga users and developers. Life goes on.

1. There can not be ANY true PPC software until there is a PPC OS
2. I have not heard of ANY Amiga PPC clone
3. When you see this soon to be unveiled "SuperChip" in action, you view of it might change a bit! :)

With all due respect, you speak as if you didn't know anything about the Amiga. Amiga Inc.'s purpose is R&D, this can not be done over night and with out a business plan, reinforced by an appropriate budget. Gateway has done the MOST important thing of all, sign the checks, and there has been a LOT of them. Amiga International was and will continue to be a sales office. And they will sell whatever products are available.

The only thing that has been "crippled" has been the decision to make PPC the official future of the Amiga. A decision that wasn't made by Amiga Inc. in the first place. All other Phase 5 products support current Amigas, so they will be useful until the end of the millennium.

Are you kidding me? The Amiga platform IS DEAD. What is this trouble you are speaking off? The current amiga user base is only a few thousand people, do you seriously expect Amiga Inc. (or ANY company) to spend MILLIONS of dollars to accommodate the current user base who seems to prefer the "status quo"? This sounds harsh, and it is! I'm not trying to demean anybody, but the time has come to make drastic desisions for the future of the Amiga, and those hard decisions are not going to please every body.

What "tried and true" companies are you speaking of? Phase 5? Their PPC project is YEARS from being completed. Only the hardware seems to be done. It will take years (if they ever finish) to convert Amiga OS to PPC.

They have truly taken on a monumental task, but unlike previous attempts by other inept companies, Amiga Inc. has a tremendous asset, the big pockets of Gateway who also stand to benefit from the success of the Amiga. And the renewed interest of (millions) previous Amiga owners (like me) who want (desperately) the new Amiga to be a grand success!

Let me finish by saying this; although we seem to differ in some points, no matter what your position is now concerning the future of Amiga, if the Amiga ever returns to the forefront of computing it will be because of people like you (not like me), who held the torch high even when nobody was watching, and we all, present and future Amiga owners, owe a debt of gratitude to current Amiga owners (like you) for allowing the future to happen.

                                                                Jose Alvarez

                               YER EDITORIAL

Mike,

In response to your latest editorial:

"Primarily, I'm troubled by the idea that Amiga Inc. is going to look to a third party for the basis of the kernel of the next AmigaOS."

Me too. I'd certainly like to hear the reasoning behind this. If there are some technical reasons, let us know.

Phase 5 has practically the whole field to itself in the area of PPC accellerators. This hasn't changed because of the announcement. Anyone who has an Amiga still has the same set of reasons to buy a PPC card that they had before the announcement. I am still saving money to get a PowerUp board. I want faster 3D rendering now, not in 1.5 to 2 years. The new Amigas may be a completely different animal, and I will buy one when they appear, but I won't stop using and upgrading my 4000 until it stops running, or (here's the rub) I start spending serious money on the new Amiga. Somehow, I think Phase5 will survive and be involved with the new Amigas. There is time for them to figure out how to do this. I am going to suggest to them that they start developing the non-linear video editing hardware and software, with audio and midi, that the new Amiga will need. Try a new direction. Take advantage of the new horizon instead of dreading it.

This plan gives the Amiga a distinct advantage over the Wintel/Mac platforms... they have the considerable weight of backwards compatibility slowing them down. This bold a move is impossible for Wintel or Mac. Now that AI has steered in this new direction it's time to stomp down hard on the gas pedal, not the brakes. I would have loved to see the existing Amigas evolve into a world-beating computer platform, but that plan probably had too much inertia to get it rolling soon enough. I suppose we'll never know now. They've chosen revolution instead of evolution. Ok, then, let's DO IT!

@{B}
Thanks for the comprehensive feedback.

I stand by what I said. All indications say that Amiga Inc. is starting a new platform with the Amiga label. I can't speak for everybody, but I personally have stuck with the Amiga because I like it for what it is, not because I envy some engineering blueprints of what it is promised to be. I would have liked to see a bit more familiarity retained.

I am very much going to play this by ear. I'm staying with the Amiga as long as it retains what I like about it. If Amiga Inc. accomplishes that, great. But from what they have said, I have my doubts; and either way, I foresee a bumpier ride than I would have preferred, and than I feel is truly necessary.

As this is such a controversial subject, we would be interested in hearing more readers' opinions.

The dust begins to settle over the long night to come after The Infamous Announcement of May 15, and promises a dark period where Things Go Bump In The Night, and our worst fears take shape in haunting visions, dreams and nightmares alike. The winds of change stir up the fallout further clouding the horizon, blocking out the light of day, depriving us of much-needed light, a light we need to grow and thrive.

No, it isn't Armageddon; ever since Amiga Inc. unleashed a twisted whisper of hope unto the Amiga community, the newsgroups, magazines, and user groups have echoed with the disbelief of the disillusioned. There are the faithful who have embraced the New Deal, but by far the gist of what I've heard says Yes, we'll see a New Amiga, but it won't be the computer we know and love.

Then the following appears, as if AI heard the jaded begin to get up out of their seats and prepare to leave the theatre, as if signalling the show just might be over.

And neither will anyone else who reads it; all I get out of the body of the message is SSDD (Same Stuff Different Day), or rather, a re-wording of the message sent by Amiga Inc. for quite a while now: "Don't Worry, Be Faithful." Amusingly, it sounds like an "Elvis Sighting," with the added "punch" that Mr. Carl Sassenrath Himself speaks the words AI knows we want to hear.

So, in reference to the title of this essay, "You Ain't Seen Nuthin' Yet"...that's right. I ain't seen nuthin' yet. Except the domino-like falling of Amiga-related businesses including Oregon Research and Deimos Design (just to name a few). I suspect these late-breaking developments related to The Amiga don't much help those folks, or make them feel terribly hopeful.

Don't get me wrong! I would be overjoyed to awaken from this long, strange trip to a world where Amiga was a real contender in a society become complacently "satisfied" (for lack of a better word) with PC's and Windows (one can realistically equate the two terms). The most significant acquisition in knowledge for me since being (somewhat) forced to acquaint myself with the "workings" (also for lack of a better word  :) of Windows is the quantum leap in the number, and style, of curses I have endowed upon numerous work sessions with The Dreaded 95. (After a short period of time, I ran out of the standard oaths, as they became so frequently used that their impact wilted; as a result, such expositions as, "You dirty slug-eating miswired tepid-brained insignificant piece of (fill in the blank, from The Standard List  :)"...became common, and actually eased the tension (from the laughter) and increased my vocabulary somewhat.)

I remember (this old song and dance) when Chrysler bought American Motors Corporation, and the very-popular 4-wheel-drive passenger vehicle, The Eagle, was promised continued production. The product that resulted from that event, sadly, did not resemble the Eagle that had gained so many faithful users, who disgustedly shook their collective heads at what was "tagged" as the Eagle, and left in droves to seek other established venues for their 4-wheelin' needs.

I fervently hope that Amiga Inc. has good intentions for The Amiga, and that we will recognize it, if and when it appears on the market.

WOA! (oops!) I mean, WHOA! Hold on there, easy on the acronyms! @{I}What@{UI} does it all @{I}mean@{UI}?

You don't @{I}know@{UI} what The Initials stand for? Oh, @{I}I@{UI} see, you're just the average user, not the "I've been here since The Beginning" Amiga "expert."

Don't feel left out; half the time (yeah, it's obvious) I don't know what the letters stand for. Truly, upon closer examination, they are not pretentious, made-up terms...there's so much confusion in the Amiga world that each event needs a name of its own (to help distinguish from any similar, living or dead, events or organizations that eerily ring familiar or sound just like any of its predecessors). AI, for instance, does not mean Artificial Intelligence (to the Amigan); it means Amiga Incorporated. AC, likewise, doesn't mean Air Conditioning; rather, Amazing Computing.

Special consideration is given here to CUCUG, the Champaign-Urbana Computer Users Group (@{U}http://www.cucug.org/@{UU}), and their Amiga Webmaster / Event Chairman, Kevin Hisel, a site I personally cannot do without  :) and a man to whom I owe a debt of gratitude. (Thanks, Kevin!)

Back to the tripe (the stuff I am writing!): AAA refers not to the American Automobile Association, but to Advanced Amiga Architecture (The Chip set, for the uninitiated). CIA does not by its name suggest the Central Intelligence Agency, but the Complex Interface Adapter. CEO stands not for Chief Executive Officer; to the Amigan, it's @{I}just a swear word!@{UI} :)

WB refers not to Warner Brothers, and if you are to believe the following clip, apparently, it doesn't exclusively refer to the Amiga "Workbench" either:

ARexx is a language, not a dinosaur...I think. MUI is not the sounds you hear on a Gateway commercial; it's Magic User Interface. PAL is no friend of m-EYE-n,  AM doesn't mean morning, it means The Amiga Monitor, and SAM is not Surface to Air Missile...as of late, he is our Senior Editor, and NOT....well, I just plain do NOT understand most of the acronyms.  :)

(It's a fair bet, when confronted with a new acronym, that any given "A" will stand for the word, "Amiga".)

My mailbox is regularly filled with press releases and info-bits about the ICOA (Industry Council of the Open Amiga), the JMS (Jay Miner Society...if you don't know who Jay Miner is, help is available  :) , TA (Team Amiga) etc. etc., more than FIFTY MAIL MESSAGES A DAY! And @{I}I@{UI} am merely an INDIVIDUAL, and a self-admitted "techno-challenged" one at that. How does one keep up with all the acronyms? I'd like to suggest a few new letter-littered phrases of my own: for instance, "AAAA" (Association for the Amiga Acronym Abusers) or "AAU" (not, as the name might suggest, Astronomical Amiga Units, which would be a welcome number of Amiga computers being shipped to retailers around the world, but Average Amiga Users) or ASAP (the Associated Society of Amiga Programmers...somehow, though, the connotations don't work  :) or the SPCAA (the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Amiga Acronyms, in which case about now I'd be BUSTED! :). Or maybe we could offer a mini-course, AmiganBASIC, to familiarize The Uninitiated with all the terms unique to The Platform. So what's the point of all this? Hold on, folks, there is a point here somewhere....in the acronym, "AAU."

If Amiga Incorporated hopes to take the world by storm beginning November (or two more weeks thereafter  :) it would behoove them to consider all those non-Amigans out there (with real money in their budget, with a new computer in store...we hope). The Amiga Community is, by its survivalist nature, a tight-knit, highly organized group of faithfuls who have, against all odds, stayed cohesive and unified, part of which is evident in the proliferance of the aforementioned acronyms. We have made events, formed organizations, and having assigned each a special code-word for identification, formed a Brotherhood of Bywords. Now we even have an Official Song, and an Official Poster. We have Heroes (Jay Miner, or, more fondly, "Father Jay"; for my cartoon tribute which appeared in AM1_9 see @{U}http://members.aol.com/kylewebb/lhd1_9.html@{UU}). One gets the feeling of a Members-Only group, and @{I}THAT IS WHERE THE WALLS MUST COME TUMBLING DOWN@{UI}...at least, make an easily-accessible passageway for new blood.

Let's face it, the average computer user, accustomed to the Gates / Windows / PC venue, doesn't particularly have a huge vocabulary of Very Special Terms in addition to standard computer-speak (unless you count the Beta version collection of curses, oaths, and swear words often associated with dealing with Windows...see my article, "You Aint' Seen Nuthin' Yet!"). I suspect all those potential Amiga users / owners AI is counting on to bolster the Amiga fiscal picture come November (and beyond) will be daunted by the "Private Club," "Members Only" feel of the Amiga Big Picture if and when they begin taking a closer look at this soon-to-be-released Orphan Computer. Granted, it has been necessary to be obsessive when living the (so far) successful attempts to keep Amiga on life support all these years, and we feel like a special group of (probably more intelligent, right?) Users when compared to those who have settled for life with Windows, some 90+ percent of the computing world, last I checked. This is a significant number of raw humanity who must be made to feel welcome into The Brotherhood, if AI and users alike expect cash influx; without this support, even the most faithful cannot foresee an ailing platform continue in the face of uninterrupted adversity.

So: someone in charge (who's in charge here, anyway?) please think ahead: so much resource has been aimed at keeping the Home Crowd feeding the Home Fires. Now we need a long-term plan to handle the @{I}needed@{UI} influx of refugees and immigrants from the Windows World. (Assuming there will be one, and we'd better HOPE there is one.) The Gates (no pun really intended :) must be swung open; Amigan As A Second Language must be made available and @{I}easy@{UI}; and taking clues from The Real World, (I'm getting a little nauseated by All The Capitals, but this is an Amigan format, remember?  :) prepare in every way to make it @{I}attractive@{UI} to defect to the Amiga.

You don't have to be a mechanic to drive or BUY (keyword, folks) a car.

I often feel like an outsider when confronted with all the acronyms, the newsflashes, the hype that has been so necessary for survival in this platform. I don't like to feel like I'm crashing a private party. I can only begin to imagine what the average PC user ("What's an Amiga?" "Did you say, 'Omega?' "Oh, I thought that computer died years ago!") will perceive of us as a viable group if and when the Amiga is presented as an option in the Electronics Age. I hope it's a come-as-you-are event, with no admission and no black ties. Turn away no one at the door, even if they don't know the tune. Make them feel wanted and needed, and speak to them in @{I}their@{UI} language. (Be nice......)

Or they will surely find a party where they already know everyone.

I was making supper the other day, and was fondly (?) reminded of days gone by where we came up with really inventive methods of patching our beloved computers together. 'Twas the rubber band around the broccoli that recalled these events: I remember a user group meeting where we all brought our ailing machinery for the monthly Amiga Clinic, and someone had used the same kind of rubber band to shore up the mount for a chip, or something. To paraphrase the musical artist Frank Zappa, "Where can @{I}I@{UI} go to get my Amiga fixed?" Truth is, around these parts, there @{I}is@{UI} no "Amiga Shoppe," and if and when something actually broke down in our vintage Commodore products, we were, and are, "on our own." 'Course, that's when they were @{I}built@{UI}; oh, the trials and tribulations with the crappy workmanship in our (manufacturer name deleted, YOU guess) A4000 Tower.

I suspect (not entirely seriously) that (manufacturer) may have studied the workmanship of the Amigas of old, but what may have happened is, the vintage models were around so long, it was becoming rarer and rarer to find one that wasn't "kludged" together in one way or another. As a result (snicker) the Tower (at least, the one we have, and those belonging to other folks who have "waxed eloquent" about the shoddy manufacture) was based (oh, you don't believe this, do you? I hope my@{I}self@{UI} it isn't true) on the myriad "patchwork" examples of existing Amigas.

You would not believe the non-specific weird parts that have ended up in the works. An advantage, perhaps, of having (or knowing) kids is the collection of Legos, Construx, and other such "build cool stuff" sets, is we have access to some high-quality assorted plastics etc. with which to repair failing mechanisms and structures. Oh, and it helps to have a Dremel variable-speed tool, too, in addition to the standard soldering iron, clippers, strippers, needle-nose pliers, every size screwdriver known to mankind, etc. etc. (you have all this stuff, don't you? You DON'T??? Where do @{I}YOU@{UI} go to get your Amiga fixed???  :)

I can see it now: the parts orders for this imagined manufacturing division: "Quantity 100,000 Broccoli-grade rubber bands / quantity 100,000 Radio Shack "101 Electronics Projects" kits / quantity 100 cases Lego "Space Series" (the aforementioned variety having the best assortment of smallish, unusual parts, for use as mounting pegs, shafts, spacers, etc.,...but what to do with the little Lego People?  :)  I think you get the point.

In conclusion, I'd like to invite the readers to send in their stories relating "How I Spent My Summer Vacation" fixing an Amiga with "stuff" never intended for such use. If I receive enough, I will ask the publisher to print (with appropriate disclaimers as to viability of "recommended" fix, etc.) the collection (which has the potential for some very amusing applications....you did WHAT with a Popsicle stick? You used WHAT to dampen vibrations coming from the drive?)

As an addendum, I (and I'd bet, you) have created "custom tools" out of such novelties as paper clips (an indispensable item in the toolbox); there is, in fact, one mounted (with tape) inside the computer where it waits for its next and very specific-to-the-architecture use. Why not? In its present incarnation, it is utterly useless for @{I}any@{UI} other application.

I'd love to hear from you, and your experience may help someone else.

First and foremost, allow me to apologize for the lack of the poll results last month. And for the fact that I am not going to submit one again this month. There has only been a total of seven respondents in the past couple of months, and due to life happening right now, I haven't got the time to process those responses in the proper format.

With my apologies to Paul Harvey, "...and now, the rest of the story."

I recently made a decision about my Amiga usage. The Gateway announcement helped push me over the edge, but for the most part, it was not all that important in the scheme of things. You see, I've decided that my Amiga days are numbered, at least in regards to it being my main computer. And considering how often I use my Atari computer, it is unlikely that this machine will be used much once the new machine is acquired.

Starting with the Gateway announcement, I have to say that it is good news. Anyone who expected the Amiga NOT to be remolded in Gateway's image was foolish. Reading between the lines, however, I see that I will have to buy all new software. However, even as advanced as the computer may be, and as a result the software, I will have to wait until the year 2000 to buy it. That's a two-year wait for a machine that offers no guarantees about anything. Many promises, but no guarantees. As the man says, "Show me the money." Or, alternatively, "Build it, and they will come." Gateway, in six months I will be buying a new computer, but it will not be an Amiga. If your new product does not include networking, then the chances of my buying an Amiga once it is released are slim.

Due to an event at work I was reminded of why I bought my Amiga in the first place. I saw the incredible potential of the Video Toaster back in '91, but I never had the money to buy one. Now that I can afford it, I can't justify the expenditure. I can justify the purchase price of a 3D animation package such as Lightwave. And with the new technologies such as Firewire, the Amiga is rendered (pun not really intended) obsolete. Now comes the long and difficult task of deciding what to replace this machine with.

And on that note, I must practice that very thing that I preached a few months ago. I must start my search by coming up with a coherent list of the things that I want to do with the new machine. I follow that with exploring the tools that I need to accomplish that goal. One of those tools will be the computer, and with it, the operating system.

It's been an interesting ride, and I've learned a lot in the last 7 years. Time for one last cliche: Tomorrow is another day.

"Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends..."

Hi, folks, and welcome back to SHOWTIME!

In this month's issue of @{I}The Amiga Monitor@{UI}, developments are fast and furious in the upcoming AmiWest 98 show (@{U}http://www.sacc.org/amiwest/@{UU}), being held at the Ramada Inn in Sacramento, California, July 11 and 12, 1998). There are rather lengthy expositions being posted in Team Amiga's News Channel, and it was decided their needs are better met by publishing those postings in "@{"Press Releases" LINK press}" this month. There you will find the most current developments that I have received regarding this ever-expanding, and likely highly successful show. "Everybody who's anybody" is going to be there :)

Something I should have made a point of before in previous installments of SHOWTIME! : It is likely that what you read here is outdated, due to time lapse between the submission of the article and the time @{I}The Amiga Monitor@{UI} is published. I strongly suggest for up-to-the-minute listings of exhibitors and any format changes, you consult the show's website, always provided here in the article.

Back to AmiWest: Here's their nifty banner / link, for those of you who missed SHOWTIME!, or want to have an in-depth look around the AmiWest site.

"Many people recall the days when it was fun to just play around on the old computer....the days when you had programs that would fit on a disk or two (not need a CD-ROM or two!), or...even be able to have several programs on a single disk. Some of you may never have experienced this, but may have heard of it from people who got their computing start on Timex-Sinclairs, Atari computers (they made these before they did game machines), TI-99's, C64's, Spectrums, etc. It is still possible to have this kind of fun, and still own a useful home or small business computer. You can actually find machines out in the real world that you can easily understand without having to take a degree in computer science or spend a large chunk of your yearly income to afford. You are probably saying "is this guy for real?" or "what is the catch?" No catch and it is for real! COMPUTING CAN BE FUN!!!! The SINCLAIR QL (32-bit) and the Cambridge Z88 palmtop! Also the Amiga (now owned by Gateway 2000). These machines are still available for those who want to have fun. You can even still keep your IBM compatible or Mac (not a bad, yet an expensive, computer) around for those uses they are best suited for. Read on if you want to know more. Make just one more part of life go at your speed! Come on, no more IRQ silliness! Eh? Follow the FWD Computing links to find out how to obtain, care for, and expand on one of these classic, yet still useable and fun, computers. By the way, Amigas are still being improved on and produced. QL's and Z88's are still being upgraded. They are not dead machines. You can even get professional-level emulators for Amigas, QL's, and Z88's that will run on your PC. Ask us in an e-mail about them."

* @{B}Siamese Systems Limited@{UB} (@{U}http://www.siamese.co.uk/@{UU})

"What is the Siamese System all about and how can it help you?
"Firstly the Siamese System is a philosophy backed up by the most innovative software that can be developed, both by our own efforts and in conjunction with some of the great programmers in this diverse computing market place.
"It started three years ago because my company had so many problems needing to run software that ran on three different computing platforms for multimedia development. Then I had the problems of getting the data together in one place for output to CD-ROM, and which machine should I use. Networking solved some of the problems but not the overall problem of something as simple as, why have three expensive monitors, which keyboard should I be using at present and where did I put the Mac Mouse?
"Finally it occurred to me that what I needed was to pull together some talent to help me improve my software and hardware that would join all of my systems together to create one Many Operating System computer, or as I like to call it the MultiOS-PC. We are now at the final hurdle to creating the Ultimate System for the majority of users, one that can run Windows, Macintosh and Amiga (yes, Amiga) software from within ONE box, with ONE monitor and ONE Keyboard and Mouse.
"No more trying to get data from the PC to the Mac via floppy disk or messing around with networking cards or parallel networking solutions. ALL resources are shared between the three platforms, i.e., all three OS's using the same Graphics card, Sound Card, modem etc. is an added extra bonus.
"For schools that have a lot of 68k-based Macintoshes this is the ideal way for them to migrate to the Windows environment without giving up their Macintosh software. Also the fact that there will be a large base of educational software that is simply unavailable on the PC, but with the world moving that way the schools must keep up.

And, a press release update, received in my office 6-18-98:



Press Release: Update - The 1998 Midwest Amiga Exposition.
October 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.
From: The Amiga Central Ohio Network, David Pearce and Ronn Black - MAE Coordinators.
Date: June 17th, 1998.


The Amiga Central Ohio Network is pleased to announce the recent update to the exhibitor listings for the Midwest Amiga Exposition along with the new face-lift our web site has recently received.

Our show this year is taking place at the Hyatt Regency Columbus, which offers us almost 7,000 square feet of exhibitor space, making this show THE largest show in North America this year and doubling our show from last year! The Hyatt Regency is a perfect location for our event and features dozens of downstairs restaurants and shops as well as being close by many activities, restaurants, and micro breweries of downtown Columbus. We are also proud to announce that IRC, Web Cam, and WWW access will be available from the show floor this year. We will be setting up dedicated lines for each of these allowing for total participation from the Amiga community from around the world with no interruptions!

You can check out who is going to be present at our show by visiting @{U}http://www.amicon.org/mae.html@{UU} and following the "Who will be there" link. Right now, we've only listed a few companies and user groups who have committed at this time. Many more will be appearing soon as the show dates draw closer, so please watch for updates in the coming weeks.

At this time the seminars are being lined up with the gracious help of the ICOA (@{U}http://www.amiganet.org/icoa/@{UU}) who have done an outstanding job of coordination and scheduling past seminars at other major Amiga events around the world. Our seminars page will be updated soon with a list of times, costs, and descriptions of the seminars that will be offered.

Vendors are encouraged to sign up soon and get your requests for prime floor space in early. All vendors will receive detailed instructions and floor specs as the show dates draw closer. Pipe and drape is available for that "professional" look as well as dedicated phone lines. Please visit @{U}http://www.amicon.org/mae.html@{UU} and follow the "Exhibitor Information" link to find out prices, selections and other details.

For room reservations, please contact the HYATT REGENCY COLUMBUS at (800) 233-1234 or (614) 463-1234 and tell them you will be attending the Midwest Amiga Exposition on October 2nd, 3rd, and 4th to receive a special show attendee discount. Also, please make sure you call the Hyatt Regency Columbus and not the Hyatt of downtown Columbus. These are two different places and we're not big enough to occupy both at the same time (yet!).

Tickets are $12.00 for two days and $8.00 for one day, available at the door of the show. Some seminars may be extra.

Grand prizes, games, new products, official press statements, educational seminars, great people, great deals, and everything great about the Amiga will be at the Midwest Amiga Exposition! So shouldn't you be?

Visit our web pages at @{U}http://www.amicon.org/@{UU}, check out the show details, send us mail about our typos ;) and if you don't see your favorite Amiga vendor on the list, e-mail us and we'll make sure they know you want to see them at the 1998 Midwest Amiga Exposition!

If you have any questions about attending the show or seminars, or about exhibiting for our show, please e-mail David Pearce, @{U}dpearce@amicon.org@{UU} or Ronn Black, @{U}rblack@amicon.org@{UU}. A phone number will be available shortly to take inquiries.

Announcing a new Web Site for the Benefit of The Amiga Community.

Amiga Yellow Pages.

Launched Sunday 7 June 1998.

Amiga Yellow Pages is like any other Yellow Pages -- but dedicated to the Amiga only.

Everything appears as a classified listing From Amiga International (A) through (b) books (Amiga), Games developers, Hardware Developers, Internet Service Providers, etc., etc.

The big difference, unlike other web classified pages, is that small companies without their own Internet web site can have a large classified display link.

(AYP is non profit making).

For example, one of the companies featured Fore-Matt home computing (a small company hoping to breakthrough in the Amiga scene) have a large display box which includes their phone number.

It is really these type of small business that AYP was setup for.

However any one can have a link as long as they are Amiga related. From large companies i.e. phase 5 through to Bedroom programmers, user groups, etc.

See for yourself at:

@{U}http://web.ukonline.co.uk/michael.carrillo@{UU}

AYP is also looking for Shops around the World which stock Amiga Products. If you know of any such retailers please e-mail me at:

@{U}michael.carrillo@ukonline.co.uk@{UU}

Please Help Amiga Yellow Pages to Help the Amiga Community.

Thanks.

@{I}Introduction by Michael Webb:@{UI}

The question has been floating around for years. Will there ever be an Amiga version of the America Online software? Most have said no, and pointed out our extreme minority status. Things are changing, however, and the Amiga may once again become a major name, and such issues as AOL may become worthy of reconsideration.

In AM, you first saw the issue raised by Sam Ormes several months ago, by way of an editorial which was subsequently given its own link on the Amiga Web Directory. There has been some response, and various discussions among AM staff members have taken place.

Nobody can pretend to know the wishes of the community, however. As a result, Contributing Editor Paul Somerfeldt put together a survey, as given below.




                         @{B}How to fill out the Survey@{UB}


We would like as many people with opinions on the subject as possible to participate in this poll. If you choose to do so, send an e-mail message to Paul Somerfeldt at @{U}p.somerfeldt@genie.com@{UU} including the information requested below (one entry per person, please). Paul will then reply to acknowledge having received your message.

At this time, we intend to post an update on the status of the poll with each issue of AM, and the poll will run throughout 1998, with all entries due by December 31 (12-31-1998). However, the sooner everybody responds, the sooner we can influence things, if it is possible to do so at all.




                                 @{B}The Survey@{UB}


In your e-mail message to Paul, please answer the following questions as they pertain to your @{U}primary Amiga system only@{UU} (where the questions are Amiga-specific) and provide the following information, and please label your answers with the numbers given for each question:

@{B}
 1. Primary Amiga System:

 2. CPU:

 3. AmigaOS:

 4. Total Memory:

 5. Speed of Internet Connection (e.g. 2400 bps, 14.4 kbps, 10Base-T, etc.):

 6. Country:

 7. Do you currently subscribe to AOL? (yes/no):

 8. (If yes to #7) Which platform do you use to access AOL? (IBM-compatible, Macintosh, IBM emulator, Mac emulator):

 9. (If no to #7) Would you consider joining AOL if an Amiga version of their software became available? (yes/no):

10. Do you use your Amiga, or another system, for most of your time online?:

11. Do you subscribe to an Online Service Provider besides AOL (e.g. CompuServe, Genie, Prodigy, Microsoft Network, Delphi, Bix), that is, something that is @{I}not@{UI} a standard Internet Service Provider? (if so, which?):

12. Do you think there should be an Amiga version of the AOL software? (yes/no/don't care):

13. Do you think it would be worth it to AOL to make their service available to Amiga users? (yes/no/don't know):

14. Any comments:

To those who send in responses, thank you for your participation.

 A little FAQ with a personal point of view concerning the
 announced new Amiga system.

--------------------

 One man's thoughts about the NG Amiga

    a small FAQ by A.R.K.



 Q: Do you think, that this new machine will be successful ?
 A: Perhaps. Most likely the same way as e.g. current
    console machines are or the A500 was, back in the 80's.

 Q: Do you think, that many of the current Amiga developers
    will make the jump to the new platform ?
 A: Depends on which migration paths AInc will supply for
    these. If it gets too expensive or difficult, one
    perhaps can be happy if 30 percent of the current
    hobbyist and shareware developers will be able to stay
    (means: go for the 4.0 system). Could be more of the
    commercial developers (if they do survive the next 17
    months or so).

 Q: Why ?
 A: One perhaps can expect, that it does not suffice to buy a
    PC and the Siamese-alike card.
    One needs to buy development tools, which usually
    are quite expensive. Most freeware/shareware developers
    didn't even buy a PPC card (which isn't as expensive).
    The NG machine perhaps may get a growing shareware
    scene once the proposed $500 machine is out, though.

 Q: What do you think will the majority of the
    existing PD/shareware scene do, then ?
 A: A guess is, that they will continue to support existing
    68k and/or PPC machines (and further developments for
    these, as maybe a newer OS 3.x or any new PPC OS
    developments) and look for alternatives at the same
    time. Promising alternatives could be BeOS, Linux,
    MacOS X or even WindowsNT (a jump to a standard platform
    may justify or even help to avoid higher costs - depends).

 Q: So you think that they won't leave the Amiga as such,
    but maybe will avoid the NG Amiga, since one may
    consider it not to be an Amiga as such any longer
    (unless reducing it to a trademark or a "spirit") ?
 A: Yes and no. If a migration to the new system isn't
    possible in a smooth way, but only a "preparation"
    through OS 4.0, this may mean that they won't
    go for it.

 Q: No chance for a comeback ?
 A: As I said, this is the wrong term. Since no one
    actually will LEAVE - it's just, that many perhaps
    won't ENTER the new system, unless it's end of
    1999 and a cheap starters machine might be
    available.

 Q: Why do you think, that such a starters machine
    may again attract hobbyist developers, students
    and so on ?
 A: If its cheap and again sets milestones as the
    A500 did, it may do that job as well.

 Q: If it's such a good concept, why wouldn't it
    attract current Amiga developers as well ?
 A: Take a look, how many people did not make
    the transition from C64 to Amiga - and how
    many people did leave the Amiga since 1994.
    "End of 1999" is still 17 months away.

 Q: So you think, that it's basically a good
    and promising approach but that it's maybe
    too early to cancel the Classic Amiga ?
 A: Absolutely. Since there's almost two years
    until the release of the new machine, one
    can't leave that classic one completely in
    the dark.

 Q: Another two years with OS 3.1 ?
 A: Of course not. There should be an OS 3.5
    with RTG and AHI, plus the ability to
    simply recompile programs designed for
    it under the new OS 4.0/5.0.

 Q: Simple recompilation ? Wouldn't that
    restrict the new OS in some ways ? I mean,
    current AmigaOS doesn't even have memory
    protection...
 A: Not at all. Take a look, how AROS
    currently does interface with Linux,
    see @{U}http://aros.fh-konstanz.de/aros/@{UU}
    Replace Linux with Amiga OS 5.0 and
    that's it...

Statement by Bill Borsari <tekmage@wam.umd.edu>

Hello friends,

As part of the election process, I have been asked to write a 500 word
statement regarding my candidacy. First, I am an American living in
Washington DC, USA.  Since 1993 I have been a member of the National
Capital Amiga Users Group.  During my membership I was elected
Chairman twice and Vice-chairman once.  I currently own two Amiga's
and work for my self doing computer repair including Amiga's with
Video Toasters.

My love for the Amiga started many years ago when my brother gave me
an A500 for my birthday.  Since then, my fondness for my Amiga and
it's users has grown.  Not to be one who idly stood by during the dark
days, I became more active in the local user group.  Moving beyond the
local group I have become active in the Amiga community on the
internet.  These contacts have provided me access to the hearts of
users, I have learned to listen and understand the opinions of many
different users from around the world.

In the last few years those voices have formed a chorus crying for one
thing, information.  In response I am working with the UGN to provide
the most information in the fastest ways.  With the recent
announcements from Amiga Inc. at the World Of Amiga show, the Amiga
world has changed forever.  Many have seen these changes as harmful to
the Amiga and were upset that the path chosen is not more traditional.
These annoucements have been more important then the ICOA and it's
members could have been imagined.  Their actions will lead the Amiga
out of the valley and in to the future.

I feel an intense desire to become the User Rep. to the ICOA. I see
that position as the only way I can ensure our Amiga will survive and
become what we all know it could be and what it should be!


Craig Delahoy
-------------
Election statement by Craig Delahoy <craigd@ansonic.com.au>

Thank you for taking the time to read this statement. I appreciate
your interest in my candidacy, but more importantly, I appreciate your
interest in the future of the Amiga.

The role of the user representative, as I see it, is primarily to keep
a reasonable amount of user and market practicality in the
discussions, so that things don't get bogged down in the technical
aspects (or potential) without regard (or with little regard) to those
to whom the product must finally be marketed. We need to ensure that
the Amiga will still be a user's machine.  Cutting-edge and
technically advanced, certainly, but if no one wants to use it, then
that effort is wasted.

In addition, the User Representative must be a means of communication
between the Steering Committee, ICOA, AI/G2K and the wider global
Amiga user community. A channel for receiving information from the
community and voicing it within the Committee, and a channel for
taking Committee information back out to the wider community.

The user representative needs to have a grasp of the technical side of
the Amiga - both hardware and software - in order to be able
understand the discussions taking place, and to provide meaningful and
informed opinion. I have that technical understanding.

The user representative must have an understanding and appreciation of
production, marketing and business considerations, in order to follow
those arguments and contribute to those discussions. I have that
marketing and business background.

The user representative should have a clear understanding of why the
Amiga was so successful originally, why it has remained successful
despite the collapses of all around her, and a strong and practical
vision of how the Amiga can reachieve that success and offer itself as
a viable alternative. I have that understanding, being an Amiga user
since 1987, and I have the vision - having developed several marketing
and promotion strategies during my work with David Pleasance and Colin
Proudfoot, and with John Smith.

The user representative must have strong established communication
skills - both personal and professional. They must be able to listen
to the users, understand their needs and desires, and be able to
convey those to the Committee. In addition, they must be able to
report back to the community at large in a coherent, literate and
professional way. I have an extremely strong background in the
communications industry, writing for film and television and
performing corporate communications in one of Australia's largest
export corporations.

As the market picks up again, the main purpose of the role will change
little, though the focus will become more of a contact point and
conduit for opinion and comments to and from the wider user community.
Recent announcements by Amiga Inc are encouraging, pointing to the
potential quantum leap that may take us back to the presitigious
position we once held.  The detail was sketchy, but the big picture
promising.  The vision is big, and the potential - if realised -
is more than encouraging. But just as important as the future of the
hardware platform is the future of the Operating System. Many times
recently I've heard the cry that the Operating System IS the Amiga,
and I am a very strong adherent to that school of thought.

I believe there is a very strong future for the Amiga Operating
System.  There is work to be done, but the potential rewards are
mind-boggling.

The only way that the Amiga can survive as a viable personal computer
platform (forgetting for a moment it's potential in other areas), is
to provide the product that the user wants and needs in a manner and
form in which they will choose it over a competitor.

That has to be the bottom line for the Amiga - it has to be a machine
that will sell. Not as a PC clone (there are too many of them out
there already, making too little margin), but as a viable, productive
and acknowledged alternative.

An Amiga on every desk would be a lovely dream, but not necessarily a
realistic one. I'd be happy to settle for an Amiga on every second
desk! :-)

I offer my services to you - the Amiga user community - as your
representative on the ICOA Steering Committee. I have sufficient
technical knowledge of the Amiga, of computers in general, and of the
wider information technology industry, to be able to understand and
make meaningful contributions to technical discussions.  I have strong
communications skills, and will be able to voice your concerns and
your opinions coherently, and to report back to you legibly.

But I am also one of you - an Amiga user, confident in the platform
itself, and with the vision, energy and motivation to make a real
contribution to securing it's future.


Harv Laser

Election statement by Harv Laser <harv@calweb.com>

Harv Laser, 48, resides in Torrance, CA. USA and has been an Amiga
owner, user, sysop, writer and advocate since he bought his A1000 on
Oct. 7, 1985.  His current stable includes an A1200/030, an A2500/060,
a CDTV, and a mountain of peripherals, add-ons, accessories, and
software.

Harv has run the AmigaZone, an online service for Amiga owners since
1985.  (The Zone resided on the People/Link service from 1985-1991,
then moved to Portal from 1991-1996 and is now hosted by CalWeb
Internet Services.)

During those years, Harv has met, corresponded with, chatted and
interacted with and helped literally tens of thousands of Amiga owners
learn more about, and get more pleasure and productivity out of their
computers.  He's a frequent poster to Usenet newsgroups, and a
frequent denizen of the #amiga channels on IRC.

Harv's written a couple hundred Amiga articles, reviews, columns and
opinion pieces for over a dozen Amiga-specific magazines including
Amiga World, .info, Compute, Amazing Computing, Amiga+, AmNews, Amiga
Computing, CU-Amiga, Video Toaster User, AmigoTimes and many more.

Besides the just plain folks who own Amigas, Harv has known, dealt
with, beta tested for, and written manuals for many Amiga development
and product companies, and has met hundreds of developers over the
years, at the Amiga expos and shows he's attended, and at Amiga
DevCons.

The ICOA User Rep should not only be an Amiga devotee and advocate,
but be familiar with the developer community, and know the products,
what they can do, and the people who create them.

The ability to hear a user's problem or complaint, and then quickly
point them towards a solution is one of Harv's specialties.

The User Rep should have lots of contacts and associations, be able to
communicate effectively and with ease, and be a name familiar to the
Amiga community.  Harv qualifies on all of these counts.

Our local Access radio stations, The Voice, Cable FM 88.7, and KYDS 91.5 FM

realaudio streaming audio from 9 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday.
Consequently, it also airs over KYDS 91.5 FM and worldwide on the internet.
The spot is considered "run of station" which means it has no scheduled air
time.  The station take three minute breaks, three times per hour.  These
breaks occur at :20, :40, and :57 past the hour.  Times are +/- 2 minutes.
The PSA is likely to run during one of those breaks.

Listeners worldwide may access the feed by obtaining the realaudio software
free fron the realaudio at http:  //www.real.com.  The feed can be heard on
the the Access Sacramento homepage (http://www.sacramento.org).  Once there,
one can click on the "live via realaudio" link which is located in the
middle of the page on the right, and the rest will happen automatically.

KYDS has plans to broadcast from the show.  There will be interviews of
various Amiga personalities at the show.  KYDS hopes to fire up the
realaudio encoder on Saturday and send the events and interviews from the
show floor around the world via the Access Sacramento site.

Subject: World Map
Date: 28 May 1998 13:01:51 GMT

Hi dudes & dudettes,
We've started to plan the Amiga User Group World Map.
We need any and all existing user groups to give us a rough idea of
where/what  their "territory" is, so we can colour in the world maps
eg SEAL extend from East London (west) to Southend-on-sea (east), and
Chelmsford (north) to the River Thames (south). 
 If you could put a request on the Team AMIGA site, and the mailing
list, for said info, it would be great.
 Also, if I could suggest you send Amiga Format & C U Amiga an e-mail
about it as well. This would give Team Amiga more exposure :) You
could mention us if you want (but it's not necessary). Alternatively,
I could mail them, and say Team AMIGA, in conjunction with
seal.........
 Once we have the map info flowing in, and get the crayons out, we can
get to the main purpose of this, and help to organise user groups for
areas that are un-represented. 
Does anyone know of a detailed world map we can use on our miggy's ?

thanks again

 23.06.1998   PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX Announces SuperView Update and Continued Support


 In another step concerning the demonstration of planned further support of the
 "Classic Amiga" platform, including powerUP (TM), PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX today
 announced the upcoming release of SuperView NG 7.70, which will include at least
 SuperView-Library 21.3. [ Scheduled for: 30 June 1998 ]

 Every user of SuperView-Library based programs, like e.g. SuperView NG
 itself, the ArtEffect AE SuperView plugin or Picture Manager professional (PMPro)
 as well as ImageEngineer users may wish to at least upgrade the SuperView-Library
 to a newer version - the full library release is part of the freely distributable
 demo version of SViewNG, as usually.

 Registration only is required for SuperView & Tools itself - thus people who maybe
 had problems with e.g. the library shipped with the free PMPro demo from Aminet
 or with other semi or fully commercially distributed versions, may wish to install
 the new version over the old one as well.

 A number of bugs have been fixed, as well as new features have been introduced.
 For example, there now will be the long-expected Window.svdriver plus a separate
 "WinSlide" tool (the latter as part of SuperView) that finally will allow to replace
 any remaining 3rd party tools for displaying graphics in a window on public screens...

 Together with the PPC speedup modules that are available separately
 for SuperView-Library, new speed dimensions are to be encountered by
 owners of powerUP (TM) boards - the number of PPC modules already
 reached a count of (currently) 52 separate modules, including impressively
 fast ppc-native loaders/savers for e.g. JPEG, PNG and TIFF. (*)

 Here's a small overview of the programs features:

   - only requires OS V2.04 and 68000
   - utilizes OS V2.1 and V3.x features and 680x0 specific module versions,
     as well as optional powerUP (TM) powerPC module plugins (*)
   - localized and font-sensitive
   - ARexx support, AmigaGuide help and Commodity functionality
   - integrated graphics viewer, converter, editor and screen-grabber
     with basic image processing capabilities

Amiga Related Books FAQ 
*********************** 

This FAQ is compiled as a service to the Amiga community. It is an attempt to 
give the Amiga programmer and user an overview of useful books for his/her 
favorite computer. It is not complete. If you feel that a book should be 
added to the list, want to comment on one of the books in the list, want to 
point out mistakes or add missing information, please send e-mail to: 

    atkin@cs.umass.edu 

I think it is useful to hear people's comments about particular books. That 
is why some book descriptions are followed by quotes that I picked up from 
the Usenet Amiga news groups. If you want to have your comment removed or 
want to say something about a particular book, please contact me. Anonymous 
comments, content-free opinions, or remarks that I determine to be factually 
wrong will not be accepted. 

The most up-to-date text version of this FAQ can be found at:

    "It has enough theory and explains adequately the Amiga's core messaging 
    system and custom hardware accesses using C programming techniques. The 
    code however is very out of date (1.2). [The target audience is] someone 
    who has decent background in formal data structures, assembly/machine 
    level programming, and CS arithmetic (bin, hex, and decimal conversions), 
    as well as C. C++ programmers can benefit as well because the messaging

    Covers Kickstart/Workbench through version 2.0. The book is basically a 
    print-out of all the include (header) files and autodocs (on line 
    descriptions) of all the Amiga library functions except DOS. The reason 
    this book isn't listed with the "must have's" is that all this

    warehouses around the world if people look hard enough (I managed to pick 
    up a copy for a friend of mine about a year ago, after a bit of 
    searching). The book is basicaly split in to 3 parts. The first part 
    concerns the Amiga libraries, and gives a fairly comprehensive run down 
    (including descriptions, parameters, usage, etc.) of all the functions 
    (KS2.x) of all the main system libraries. The second part is an excellent 
    guide and reference section for programming AREXX. I learned everything I 
    know about AREXX from this book. It follows on in to details of how to 
    write external programs that can interact with AREXX programs, etc. The 
    third part is hardware related. This, nowadays, is less useful, mainly 
    because (i) we are now forbidden to touch the hardware FTMP, and (ii) 
    it's only the ECS hardware, not the AGA stuff. I still think this is one 
    of the most useful books I've bought."

    but it still useable otherwise. It's quite old and only goes up to 1.2, 
    and it talks about 1.1, but the basic concepts are there, which seem to 
    be lacking from more modern stuff (where it is assumed you know it

    [...] includes a complete list of the registers of the AGA-Custom-Chips. 
    As far as I know, this guide is the only available documentation about 
    AGA. It's pretty useful for demo/game coders who already know how the OCS 
    works, because the guide doesn't give any real examples (except 
    explaining how the new display and sprite modes work). The registers are 
    both listed by address and by name. If you click on the register's name 
    you get exact information about what each bit means and how it has to be 
    used. All in all I'd say that this guide is pretty useful."

    Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries and Devices 
    (1st edition; white cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1986. ISBN 0-201-11078-4 
    
    Covers the Amiga System Software up to Version 1.2. Gives a good 
    introduction to programming Amiga graphics and I/O. Many examples, mostly 
    in C (Source Code can be found on Fisk Disk ???). Since the operating 
    system has evolved quite a bit since 1986, this and the following books' 
    value is now mostly nostalgia... 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga Intuition Reference Manual 
    (1st edition; white cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1986. ISBN 0-201-11076-8 
    
    Covers Intuition programming through Workbench 1.2. A wonderfully gentle 
    introduction to programming user interfaces on the Amiga. Contains a lot 
    of information on the philosophy of the Amiga interface. Basic knowledge 
    of C required. Now superseded by the newer "RKM: Libraries" and "User 
    Interface Style Guide".

    Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Exec 
    (1st edition; white cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1986. ISBN 0-201-11099-7 
    
    Covers Exec programming through Kickstart/Workbench 1.2. The nitty gritty 
    of the Amiga kernel: Basic data structures, tasks, memory allocation and 
    the like. Now superseded by the newer "RKM: Libraries". 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga Hardware Reference Manual 
    (1st edition; white cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1986. ISBN 0-201-11077-6 
    
    The hardware bangers manual for the original chipset (OCS). Explains what 
    all the hardware registers mean and how to get them to work for you. Some 
    assembly examples. Since Commodore now officially dissuades from directly 
    accessing the hardware, and has no plans for publishing an AGA hardware 
    manual, this book is actually still fairly useful for those who have to 
    know how their computer works on the hardware level. 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs 
    (2nd edition; blue cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1989. ISBN 0-201-18177-0 
    
    Covers version Kickstart/Workbench Version 1.3. A print-out of all the 
    include files and autodocs (on-line documentation) for all the Amiga 
    library functions (except DOS). Contains summaries and call parameters 
    for all the functions. This information had previously been distributed 
    amongst the Libraries, Exec, and Intuition Rom Kernel Reference Manual in 
    the 1.2 release.

    Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries and Devices 
    (2nd edition; blue cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1989. ISBN 0-201-18187-8 
    
    All the introductory text and examples from the Kickstart Version 1.2 ROM 
    Kernel Reference Manuals, revised and updated for Version 1.3. All 
    examples are available in executable and source code form from Fish disk 
    #344. 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    Amiga Hardware Reference Manual 
    (2nd edition; blue cover) 
    Addison-Wesley , 1989. ISBN 0-201-18157-6 
    
    As far as I know, this manual is basically identical to the 1.2 release 
    described above (although it claims to be updated to release 1.3). 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    AmigaDOS V2.0 Native Developer Update 
    Commodore, [year?]. 
    CATS part number: NATDEV20 
    $20.00 
    
    The 2.0 Native Developer Update is a must-have for any Amiga programmer. 
    This four-disk set contains the final 2.0 function Autodocs, final 2.0 C 
    and assembler Amiga include files, linker libs (Amiga.lib, debug.lib, 
    ddebug.lib) FD files, offsets, a great deal of 2.0 example code, and the 
    "Software Toolkit II" disk full of the latest Amiga debugging tools. 
    (This disk set has been replaced by the new V3.1 Amiga Developer Update 
    but is still very useful for its 2.0 example code).

    programming book to learn the instruction set and register usage."

    The latest edition even discusses compatibility with C++. It *is* a 
    reference manual, though. (They did add exercises in the 3rd edition). 
    K&R's book, on the other hand, is a textbook. If you are just starting 
    out (especially if you don't have a lot of experience programming in 
    similar languages, such as Pascal), [K&R's book] will probably be a 
    better choice to *learn* the language. It is not as good as a reference.

    The complete boiled-down C manual for the Amiga which describes how to 
    open and work with Screens, Windows, Graphics, Gadgets, Requesters, 
    Alerts, Menus, IDCMP, Sprites, VSprites, AmigaDOS, Low Level Graphics 
    Routines, Hints and Tips, etc. The manual also explains how to use your C 
    Compiler and gives you important information about how the Amiga works 
    and how your programs should be designed. The manual consists of 15 
    chapters together with more than 100 fully executable examples with 
    source code. 
    
    beckwwp@eng.auburn.edu (Wendell P. Beckwith), 24 Feb 1994: 
    "This is a wealth of information, however, take note. [...] some of the 
    examples use things which are no longer thought of as good programming, 
    such as unprototyped functions. This is not really a strike against the 
    ACM, since when those portions of the manual were written, using such

    It has COMPLETE working examples for EVERY function provided by C/C++ at

    over 1,300 pages, and about 1/3 of them are USEFULL examples at the end 
    of the book. Also, there's a course on learning C on the first few 
    chapters, and then C++ is introduced. This is a real-world-use book. I 
    HIGHLY recommend it. BTW, I spend one WHOLE day looking thru every single 
    C++ book here at the bookstore before deciding on buying it. Also, don't 
    be scared by the ibm-nature of the book, almost everything in the book is

    to focus on frameworks. Frameworks represents the next level of 
    abstraction in programming and offer proof of the promise of reuse and 
    increased productivity. [...] However frameworks can be used to solve 
    virtually any design problem if programmers understand exactly what 
    frameworks are and how to use them."

5. ARexx Programming 
==================== 

5.1 Learning ARexx 
------------------ 

  o Merrill Callaway: 
    The ARexx Cookbook 
    Whitestone, 1992. ISBN 0-9632733-0-8 
    Optional Companion Disk: ISBN 0-9632773-1-6 
    
    A very good introduction to ARexx. The book uses examples to introduce 
    the features of this programing language. The examples are often very 
    useful themselves. This book is not a reference manual, but a tutorial. I 
    would say it is very well suited for beginners but also for more advanced 
    programmers. 
    
    rbyrne@3dform.edex.edu.au (Robert Byrne): 
    "This book makes heavy reference to William S. Hawes Arexx and the 
    Commodore Manual (Part No. 363313-05) and first time users are advised to 
    have one of these handy, preferably Hawes." 
    
  o Commodore Business Machines: 
    The Programmers Guide to ARexx 
    Commodore, 1991. 
    CATS part number: AREXX01, disk: AREXX01D 
    $20.00 
    
    Manual (228 pages) and disk designed to allow you easy access to the 
    power of ARexx. Includes information on how to make effective use of 
    ARexx, how to conform to development standards and how to interface 
    applicatations to the ARexx environment. 
    
    luebke@erls02.siemens.de (Reinhard Luebke), 7 Oct 1993: 
    "This book covers all topics regarding 'how to program for ARexx in C', 
    e.g. creating libraries and function hosts. Worth to say, that all 
    examples in the book can be found on a disk that comes bundled with the 
    book."

    535 pages, DM 89.00 
    (Written in German) 
    
    This book is divided into three the parts: the first covers the basics of 
    ARexx (variables, operators, the instructions, etc., organized both 
    alphabetically and by topic) and the ARexx environment. The second covers 
    three common ARexx function libraries (RexxArpLib, APIG, and 
    RexxSerDev.library), the third "hosts": the RexxPlus compiler, ExecRexx, 
    writing ARexx scripts for application programs. A disk with all examples 
    and libraries may be purchased separately for an additional DM 10. 
    
    humpty@TOMATE.TNG.OCHE.DE (Andreas Mixich), 26 Jan 1996: 
    "All in all I must say this book is extremely useful. [...] It is perfect 
    for beginners (well, you should have used your Amiga for some months...) 
    and a nice reference for advanced. Of special interest are the parts II 
    and III, which may not be found described like that anywhere else." 
    
  o Paul Overaa:

    ARexx programming, with information on adding an ARexx port to your 
    program. 
    
    gnome@martinac.demon.co.uk (John Marchant), 15 May 1995: 
    "Paul Overaa's book is excellent, but more of a tutorial." 
    
  o Chris Zamara and Nick Sullivan:

    barrett@cs.umass.edu (Dan Barrett), 24 Mar 1994: 
    "This is a good book with a particularly good function reference section. 
    It also gives examples of ARexx programming with some commercial 
    products. The only bad part of the book is its terrible index." 
    
    paulg@kralizec.zeta.org.au (Paul Gittings), 28 Mar 1994: 
    "This is the only Abacus book that I have found to be of any use, I 
    almost didn't buy it because it was an Abacus book but I'm very glad I 
    did. This book is very well suited to a beginner ARexx programmer (more 
    so than Callaway's book) and also very useful as a reference for more 
    advanced users. The example code is very trivial and therefore easy to 
    understand, for more complex and useful code examples get Callaway's 
    book." 
    
    gnome@martinac.demon.co.uk (John Marchant), 15 May 1995: 
    "I recommend the Abacus book for easy look-up of functions etc." 
    
    anderson4@delphi.com (Stanley Anderson), 30 Jun 1995: 
    "[This book] has proven invaluable to me in jamming together some Arexx 
    macros for FinalWriter."

  o Robin Evans: 
    ARexxGuide 2.0a 
    1994. (no ISBN, published via shareware) 
    $15 (suggested shareware fee) 
    
    This is a complete ARexx reference guide in AmigaGuide format. It is 
    available from Aminet ( util/rexx/ARexxGuide2_0A.lha ). 
    
    From the "readme file": 
    ARexxGuide is a complete ARexx reference with tutorials and dozens of 
    ready-to-use examples. Done in AmigaGuide format, it includes argument 
    templates and descriptions of all instruction keywords, of built-in 
    functions, and of the functions in rexxsupport.library. The basic 
    elements of the language are fully explained. Example programs -- some of 
    them interactive -- answer frequently-asked questions about the language. 
    Sample clauses are included with each function and instruction 
    explanation. Error codes and possible solutions are explained. 
    A help-system that will turn nearly any text editor into an online 
    reference to ARexx is included. Working macros for three editors are 
    provided as examples. A step-by-step tutorial explains the simple steps 
    for making a new macro for a different editor.

    "Excellent (IMHO) book containing detailed source code of a C compiler, 
    with hints and tips on how to optimise the compiler both in terms of 
    operation, and efficiency of code generated. [...] well worth the 
    investment."

    in detail the design and implementation of an entire operating system and 
    includes the complete source code of a compiler for the Oberon language 
    (a descendant of Pascal and Modula-2). The code generated is for a family 
    of processors reasonably similar to the Amiga's MC68K processors. Even if 
    you are not interested in the language, it provides an example of a 
    working compiler, which the Aho, etc. book at least does not."

    "A REALLY cool book. [...] It sort of skims over the math -- moves pretty 
    quickly through the material, but covers a lot of ground. Also includes a 
    lot of C++ code, but the text isn't occluded by it."

    "It is the book we use in the course 'Computer Graphics I&II' here at the 
    Norwegian Institute of Technology. It goes into depth in describing both 
    2D raster graphics and 3D modeling (e.g. splines) and raytracing (incl. 
    phong, gourad...). The programming eksamples are done mostly in Pascal. 
    IMHO, it is a very good book. (And lots of nice ray-traced pictures!)"

    shading, etc. etc. etc." 
    
    bwh@beach.cis.ufl.edu (Brian Hook), 06 Dec 1993: 
    "This is IT. THE bible of computer graphics, period. It covers just about 
    every topic you need to know, however because of its scope it is very 
    generalized and so information on any one specific topic may be lacking. 
    Pascal-like pseudo code is strewn liberally throughout the book, which is 
    a big help. Everything you would expect in three-D graphics is covered, 
    including shading, ray tracing, radiosity, texture mapping, etc. Once 
    again, it's very generalized and serves mostly as a good reference to 
    other material and an overview of individual areas. But at over 1000 
    pages, it's a must have if you do graphics. If you can afford only ONE 
    book on graphics, get this one."

    3d side of things. Every now and then a friend tells me 'Wow, this one 
    little paragraph in Gems [X] gave me a huge insight into what I needed to 
    do and now my [program] is MUCH faster'. So to be fair, a lot of others 
    have found these books to be invaluable. They cover a bit too much ground

    transfer files from the IBM disk to an amiga disk, though. The book comes 
    with the disk. The book is really GREAT because it's very thorough and 
    easy to understand. It teaches you from the ground up. One thing though, 
    is that the source code had a number of minor bugs which I had to fix. 
    Also, I optimized some of the code to make it faster. For one thing, I 
    replaced the 4x4 matrices with 3x3 ones. [...] It's so easy to

    running with the simple concepts that more advanced text books don't 
    bother explaining. On the other, it could REALLY stand to be improved. 
    Lots of simple algorithms are completely ignored, such as shading.

    "Excellent book on curves, patches, and a lot of math. Does not cover 
    rendering at all -- no shading, etc. It does a lot of theory on 
    projections, however -- don't expect much on object databases or 
    efficiency, though. Not a great reference to a 3d renderer, but for 
    modeling in general and math it's wonderful. HOWEVER, it has an insane 
    amount of stuff on curves, splines, Bezier curves, Coons patches, 
    surfaces, etc. So if you want to do surfaces and things with soft edges

Vulcan Software Development Team News
-------------------------------------

Deimos Design, the development team responsible for the Amiga PPC CDRom
title 'Maim & Mangle' have come to the painstaking decision to cease all
development on the Amiga platform and move to the PC-CDRom platform. 

     Since early 97, Deimos Design has existed with one goal in mind, to
support the Amiga with high specification PPC products. Throughout
development of 'Maim & Mangle' many things have affected the fluidity,
but the overwhelming factor that prompted the change of platform was the
economic realities of the Amigas constantly eroding user base. 

     Vulcan Software are also sad to see the disappearance of what
promised to be an awesome Amiga title but fully understand and support
their decision. 

Live Long & Prosper!
