       @{fg shine}Public domain (PD), shareware, and freeware: Our definitions@{fg text}

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     Many people use the terms PD, shareware, and freeware loosely, but the
 editors of The Best in Amiga Public Domain want to clarify our usages.  In
 order to keep this from being a monsterous essay about rights, we will keep
 things simple and adopt a broader standard than others might use.

     The term "public domain" is derived from literary terminology meaning
 that nobody claims any rights to a said work.  Thus, it is in the "public's
 domain" and can be used by anyone for any purpose.  But we will modify that
 term to refer to any computer software that is publically accessable and
 distributable.  So, PD-- for us-- means any software you can legally copy
 and share.  In short, we will not refer to any software which is illegal to
 distribute.

     The term "shareware" means that the author of the software requests
 that you send some form of payment if you decide that you like the
 software.  Paying may incur upgrades and/or new features.  It may simply
 clear your conscience.  In some cases, registered software cannot be
 redistributed since it is only available directly from the author.  These
 circumstances should be clearly stated in the software in question.

     The term "freeware" means that the author expects no payment for usage
 of his or her software.  For brevity's sake, we'll leave it at that.

     Unless otherwise stated in the software, all rights to software is
 owned solely by its author.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    If you have decided to write a review, here are some tips for helping
 us keep edit-time to a minimum:

    Most importantly, structure your review into paragraphs.  Each
 paragraph, even if it's only one sentence, should deal with a single area
 of your topic.  For example, you don't want a paragraph that discusses
 aspects of interface and the sound effects both.  Break this into separate
 paragraphs, and it will make your review seem more "together" and
 professional.

    Remember 5th grade English and the Topic Sentence?  Each paragraph
 should begin with a broad topic sentence that gets explained in detail in
 the body of the paragraph.  Also, no sentence in a paragraph should give
 redundant or useless information.  Keep it lean.

    Separate paragraphs with a blank line.

    Try to watch spelling and punctuation, but don't worry about this as
 much as structure and content.

    Following these suggestions, along with the template, should provide us
 with a review that will require little in the way of editing, and we can
 get around to putting the magazine together faster.  Thanks for your
 interest and contributions!

 Hello!

 And welcome to the very very late Issue #3 of The Best In Amiga PD!

   No folks we didn't give up, just kinda lost some of my help so I'm
 puting together a new staff and we'll be better than ever!

   First a few help wanted adds. :)  Looking for a full time game
 reviewer to try and write reviews on all the latest games (been
 quite a few lately!).  Next I'm looking for a great news hound.
 Some one to keep me up to date on all the news thats fit to print,
 on all the latest software and updates coming out.  And we are
 looking for some general reviewers too.  So if you are remotely
 intersted, E-Mail me at roy@cgl.com

   Next You'll noticed I've we've changed the format again! But for
 the better. The magazine will continue to change as we mold it into
 the fine Amiga publication it should be.  We will be on a regular
 monthly schedule now though!

   Also included in this archive is a gif of our logo for you guys
 to use on any web pages that might be out there, or coming out
 there.  I thank David Putzier for the great job he did on the
 logo.  Check it out aswell as the runner ups on my web page!

   And remember I want to see your comments and sugestions! So please
 don't think twice about sending me some mail!


   Thanks,

   Roy Milican

 Greets,

  AmigaPD is back, and for good now, hopefully.  I'm rather new to AmigaPD,
 and the e-zine scene in general, so bare with me on this. :)

  You should have read our plea for help by now, if not, you soon shall.  We
 can't stress enough that without help, our chances of going very far are
 dim.  If you are a (even partly) hardcore Amigan, and want to make yourself
 heard, now's your chance.  Read Roy's editorial for more information.

  The mag will look much nicer in the next couple of issues.  I have not the
 time right now to put my many ideas into work currently, but a few are in.

  I'm at a loss of words right now, so I'll end this in a simple statement--
 It's a pleasure being here.

                                    Enjoy,

                                    Jason Fisher

 @{fg shine}Documentation@{fg text}

    The documentation covers most everything you need to know about this
  game, at least to play it.  One of the features of this game that could
  make it a real contender is that it is set up on a client/server basis.
  The documentation does not go into much detail about the clients.  Also
  the author spent more time in trying to make the documentation funny
  than spedning time talking about the actual program.
           

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

    KRSnake is a good snake game.  It has a lot of features that if the
  author takes advantage of will make it one of the best available.
  However, as the program is right now, I don't care for it much.  In order
  for me to do a good review on this game I am going to do a bit of compar-
  ing to "A Better Snake", a very good Snake game (see review in our July
  issue).

    Firstly KRSnake's "snake" is just a bunch of boxes following eachother
  across the screen.  The boxes that it eats are just hollow boxes that look
  like a part of the snake.  "A Better Snake" does not use a lot of graphics
  but it does have a better looking snake.

  Both games appear to be equally fast!

    KRSnake allows you to turn around into yourself.  This can become very
  annoying if you let your fingers slip.

    In order to know the value of the box you are going to eat in KRSnake you
  have to glance up to the top of the window to see what it says.  "A Better
  Snake" has the number inside the "box" so you don't have to have your eyes
  wandeing all over the screen when your snake is cruising across the screen
  at light speed.

    KRSnake lets you size the window you are playing in.  This is a neat
  feature, but it does not appear to increase your playing field, but instead
  makes everyhting bigger.  If it would just increase the playing field it
  would be a sort of a way to adjust beginner to advanced levels...

    KRSnake is setup on a client/server system and I think that this could
  provide for some really neat possibilities, but none of them have been
  implemented.  Maybe you could have it set so that multiple snake could run
  the screen at the same time?  Just a thought...

    If you are looking for a Snake game then I suggest "A Better Snake", if
  you already have it then check this one out, it may have what you are looking
  for.

 @{fg shine}Documentation@{fg text}

    The documentation is very detailed and complete.  It covers all aspects of
  the program and leaves nothing behind.  In doing this it is still very
  short, so you can read the whole document, and understand all you need to
  know without spending a great deal of time.  But, this is another "Snake"
  game, so how much documentation do you really need?

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

    Alright, so you are getting tired of all these "Snake" clones, huh?  Well
  those people out there programming them are still making them...  I happen
  to enjoy them...  'SnakesNAdders' brings with it a new twist that hasn't
  been in the other "Snake" games that I have been reviewing and that is
  levels!  I will get to that in a minute...

    This is another Workbench based game.  Why do I always do reviews on these
  type of games instead of regular games?  Well I use a Retina Z2 with a
  single monitor and hate having to switch my monitor around and disable my
  graphics card, I like to be able to just sit down and play a game, it
  should not be a lot of work.  So I stick to these Workbench games.

    It is very fast, about the same speed as 'KRSnake' or 'A Better Snake'.
  The graphics are not as nice as 'A Better Snake' and only slightly worse
  than 'KRSnake'.  It is, however, more of a challenge than the other two
  because as you guide your "snake" to its' to gobble you get to watch it
  decline in value and are made aware of the amount of time you have to
  reach your destination.

    You get to decide wether or not you want the feature enable to allow you
  to turn around on yourself and "eat" yourself causing instant death,
  unlike 'A Better Snake' where you just can not do it and 'KRSnake' where
  you have no choice but to suffer if you have "fat fingers" and chance
  running into yourself.

    The top of the window displays your score, the high score, level you are
  on, the high score for that session and the number of "eatings left until
  you advance to the next level.

    Levels?  What do you mean levels?  Many years ago there was a machine
  called the Commodore 64 and one of my favorite games was called "Snake
  Bite".  I believe this was probably the first "Snake" game that us
  Commodore users had ever seen.  There were dozens of levels and the
  tricky part was after finishing a level you where zooming around the
  screen, your fingers hitting arrow keys faster than you could actually
  think about it, then a little tiny door would open and you had to guide
  your "snake" out the door.  Sounds pretty tough?  It was, this game brings
  some of that with it.  If you have played one of the other "Snake" games
  then you already know what levels 1 is like, just a big blank area to
  guide your "snake" around, but levels 2 there is a big cross in the
  middle of the screen that is just as deadly as any wall around the edge.

    I did not notice in the documentation how many levels there are in this
  game, and at the time of this writing I haven't gotten past level 2.

    I would like to see a High Score table implemented so you can see how
  well you have done over time.  Other than this I would rate this game
  above 'KRSnake' and even with 'A Better Snake' due to the levels.  Get
  it and keep it in your collection, it is very small...

    I have found one bug if a Oktalyzer or ScreamTracker mod is loaded
  it will cause a requester to pop up asking if you want to save a
  instrament.  If you say cancel it will go on and play the mod. Not
  a bad bug, just a little annoying.

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

    DeliTracker is a highly configureable very multitasking friendly
  mod player.  Plays correct speed for PAL/NTSC, and one of the unique
  things is it knows when a med module has come to an end!  Writen in
  complete Assembler language it is a very fast running low system useage
  mod player.  It alocates the sound channels in a way that alows the
  it to be friendly if a system beep was to come through your computer
  would not crash.  DeliTracker also comes equip with an Arexx port.

    To those that know me they know I like mods very much.  I have over
  300 of them on my HD.  When I started really collecting them the first
  problem i ran into was space.  I used the earlier versoin of this program
  but starting after version 2 you were able to play compressed mods. This
  of course made everything alot easier.  It has support for the xpk
  compression libraries or you can even use LHA, which is what I use.

    In addition to being able to play compressed mods one of the key features
  of DeliTracker is the variety of formats it will play.  With over 52 diffrent
  players I have yet to run  into a mod that it would not play.  It has support
  for all the frequently used formats and then also for that certain format
  that is rarely used.  When you install, it gives you the option to install
  just the most frequently used players then asks if you want some of the more
  rare format players.

    Now to go on some more interesting features.  Genies a new addition
  starting in the 2.0 version of DeliTracker are unique enhancements to your
  mod playing pleasure.  They are small extra programs that interact with the
  music being played by Delitracker of enhance it.  You chose which ones are
  to be installed and when you start you chose and configure the ones you want
  to be activated at the start of DeliTracker.  The Decruching Genie is use to
  load the compressed mods into DeliTracker.  Noteplayer genies are used when
  a noteplayer is required for the mod.  Other genies such as the Quadra Scope
  and Stereo Scope are strictly for viewing enjoyment.

    Another nice feature and ones of my favorite things about DeliTracker is
  the module list.  You can set it to a directory where you store all your mods
  and have a convient list of mods.  You can save diffrent lists load diffrent
  ones and have virtual CD's if you like.  You can click on a mod in the list
  and it will be played.

    If you like mods this is a definite mod player to check out.  With its many
  features low system usage and Genies, it makes for a very unique player.  The
  only feature this mod player is majorly lacking is a no chipmemory feature.
  When it is equiped with this option there can be no comparison.

  MechForce v3.71

 @{fg shine}Exact Filename / Size / AmiNet Directory@{fg text}

  Headquarters.lha, 700K, /game/misc/

  There are a few archives containing various versions of MechForce (even
  the ancient BattleFort, an early version of MechForce, is on Aminet),
  but this is the most recent and comprehensive archive that I know of.

 @{fg shine}Brief Description@{fg text}

  Based on the rules from the role-playing game BattleTech, you control a
  giant robot in tactical, turn-based combat against/with up to 15
  opponents and/or friends.  Strategy fans rejoice!

@{fg shine} Author / Copyright Information@{fg text}

  Original MechForce by Ralph Reed.  Copyright © 1989 Ralph Reed.  All
  rights reserved.  Contacting Ralph Reed is notoriously difficult.

  Development was supposedly taken over by Andreas Smigielski, though
  there are no apparent changes in this release besides the fact that
  the game no longer multitasks.  This archive is copyright © 1993
  Andreas Smigielski, released under the GNU Public License.

 @{fg shine}ShareWare Fee@{fg text}

  Since Andreas took over, there is no longer any shareware fee.

 @{fg shine}Hardware / Software Requirements@{fg text}

  The old version of MechForce ran only on OS 1.3.  Andreas has updated
  this version to run under 2.0 (and probably 3.0?).  You'll need at
  least 1 megabyte of RAM.  For any practical gaming, you'll want a HD
  or, at worst, 2 floppy drives.

 @{fg shine}Documentation@{fg text}

  The documentation is good, but could use some rewriting and further
  elaboration.

 @{fg shine}Known Bugs@{fg text}

  MechForce has been known to crash on occasion (under OS 2.0).  I
  suspect it has to do with low memory problems.

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

  @{fg fill}About the Archives@{fg text}

    For clarity's sake, I will state just what I intend in this review.
  MechForce is the actual game program and the focus of this review.
  There is a separate program, called Headquarters, that is used in
  conjunction with MechForce to handle things like purchasing mechs and
  healing characters between combat sessions.

    The archive containing the game program, MechForce, reviewed here
  contains a Headquarters program.  However, I did not review it because
  I don't like it as well as another Headquarters program, which I did
  review elsewhere in this issue.  Further references to MechForce means
  the game program, while references to Headquarters (or HQ) means the
  program by Stefan Hulswitt.

  @{fg fill}Introduction@{fg text}

    I'm sure that by now most gamers know what a 'mech is.  If you don't,
  then here's a brief description.  Imagine a gigantic, humanoid or
  animal-like war machine standing forty feet high.  Imagine it with 20
  tons of weapons and ammo.  Imagine it with 30 tons of thick armor.  Now
  imagine yourself controlling this hulking robot's every move from
  inside its head-- literally.

    If you ever saw the RoboTech cartoon that briefly aired (in USA, at
  least), then you have seen them.  And anyone who's played FASA's great
  role-playing game BattleTech knows exactly what I'm talking about.  And
  since there's a glorious 3D version of this gaming system and fiction
  rolling onto shelves for PCs, here's the Amiga's best offering in the
  genre.. and it's free.

  @{fg fill}Presentation@{fg text}

    First of all, let's clear up any misconceptions about the graphics and
  sound right off.  These are not areas where MechForce shines the
  brightest, although the sounds do add a lot to the enjoyment.
  Depending on the size and power of your weaponry, there is an
  accompanying launch and report which is usually very appropriate.  The
  graphics, while in 16-color 640x400 hires, are only serviceable.  They
  aren't bad, but by current standards they could use a facelift.  I'm
  not complaining, though, because they are quite crisp, and they could
  be a lot worse.

  @{fg fill}The Gameplay@{fg text}

    Needless to say, MechForce rivals most games with excellent gameplay.
  If you have any interest in role-playing or strategy games, then you
  will be hooked.

    In any given combat session, you'll find yourself in a large hex-grid
  map of the battle area.  Most games will be combat missions, but you
  have the options to practice or fight in the arena where you can gamble
  and make lots of cash.  Combat missions award experience points and
  money, based on your contract with one of many sponsoring "houses,"
  which are actually like corporations.  Once you fulfill your contract,
  you gain prestige and money to improve your mechs, characters, and
  contract stipulations.  That is where the Headquarters program comes
  in.  You use it to update these statistics and your status.

    There can be up to 16 players, 8 on each team, and up to 7 on each team
  can be computer controlled.  Generally, unless you have a gaggle of
  friends to play with, you'll end up playing one or two mechs yourself
  against a computer contengent.  The computer opponents are smart, but I
  have caught them cheating from time to time (for example, their
  jump-jets recycle instantly).  Playing with a lot of AI friends or
  enemies will strain your RAM, so watch out, because this is where
  frequent crashes occur.

    Combat takes place in turn-based phases.  Each opponent gets a turn
  based on a quirky, but logical, system of "timers."  These timers are
  abstractions of how long it takes a weapon to "recycle" (re-arm) and
  the time it takes for your mech to move (ie, walk, run, etc).  Once you
  get the flow, things proceed quickly.

    And it's here that MechForce truly begins...

  @{fg fill}The Options@{fg text}

    Before combat, you have to buy a mech.  You might even venture to
  design your own and buy it.  There is a huge stock of ready-made mechs
  to choose from, though.  Purchasing a mech is one element that makes
  this game so fun.

    There are so many options!  Not only must you select the types of
  armaments to wield (each requiring a certain strategy to use
  effectively), you must also select how heavily armored your machine
  will be and where it will be armored.  Further, you must select engine
  size, heat sinks to keep cool (so ammo doesn't explode), jump jets to
  allow flight, and various other items.

    The best thing about this feast of choices is that they are not only
  available, but they change your tactical strategies.  Having jump jets
  and not having jump jets definitely makes a difference when in combat.
  Being able to fly into the air allows you to see enemies over mountains
  and perform the dangerous "death from above" maneuver.  It also allows
  you to move faster, leap over swamps, snow and other slippery terrains,
  and generally gives you an edge.  That's just the jump jets!  Your
  strategies are affected by each decision you make at
  purchase/construction time.

    Even more options abound:  play on a team or not?  Do practice combat
  or real combat missions?  Use your doctor to heal your mechwarrior or
  go to the hospital?  Salvage your nearly defunct mech or spend the
  money to repair it?  Take the contract terms from Star Reavers or wait
  for a better opportunity?  Kill the heavy mech first or the three light
  mechs?

  @{fg fill}Conclusion@{fg text}

    I could go on forever.  Since MechForce is based on a paper and pencil
  game, it has much complexity and depth.  If you are familiar with the
  FASA game rules and world, you should be very happy here.  Even if you
  don't know a mech from a bomb shelter, you will probably be happy here.
  It's a rich and rewarding game that can continue for a long time.
  Replayability is extremely high, especially with friends.

    Alas, though, it's original creator, Ralph Reed, has disappeared from
  the Amiga community.  I've only heard rumors about his continued
  development of a subsequent product (something called MechCombat).  The
  light at the end of this tunnel, though, is that the MechForce source
  code is available to a few people.  But it's looking like nobody is
  going to add to this great game.

    Ah, well...  we can blast each other up anyway.  And have a dang fine
  time of it too.

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

    Everybody remembers Breakout.  Well, at least *some* version of it.
  The premise is simple:  you control a "paddle" that a ball bounces off
  of.  You guide the ball to destroy "bricks" until there are none left.
  Generally, you attack the same wall again and again, but it's fun.
  Well, that's Breakout.

  But this is MegaBall...

    Keep that basic idea, bouncing a ball with a paddle and hitting bricks,
  but add in a few new ideas:  power-ups, exploding bricks, limitless
  levels.  Things get tricky fast, especially since not all power-ups are
  beneficial.  You have to think quick.  Add to this optional AGA
  graphics, lots of good, customizable music, and multitasking.  Now
  you've got a great game!

    Using your mouse, you move the responsive paddle horizontally along the
  bottom of the screen.  Bricks of varying colors and properties rest
  above, some harboring power-up squares that will float down for you to
  catch.  The mechanics are simple.  The ball bounces at steeper angles
  proportional to how far from the center of your paddle it hits.  You'll
  need to master this for some of the more treacherous levels.  Animation
  is smooth, and the exploding chain-reactions are a spectacle all to
  themselves.

    The bricks have varying properties.  Some can't be destroyed, others
  take only one hit to destroy.  Some require multiple strikes to
  destroy.  When all the bricks are cleared, you go to the next level.
  While the unregistered version has several levels, looping through them
  will get old.  Registration should cure this.

    There is a wide spectrum of power-ups.  My favorite is the lasers.  My
  least favorite is the one that shrinks your paddle.  Some give extra
  lives, increase the size of the paddle, cause the ball to stick to the
  paddle instead of bouncing, et cetera, et cetera.  This is really what
  makes replayability and fun factors high.

    There is a two-player mode (taking turns), and the game tracks highest
  scores.

    Although this game has been around for a while and there are some like
  it, I think this is the best implementation around.  For this or that
  reason, the others fall short of what Ed achieved.

    Here are some other files to expand your MegaBall horizons.  Keep in
  mind that these files are only useful for registered players, AFAIK.

    When it was first released, back in 1989 or 1990, the registered
  version of MechForce came with several utility programs that allowed
  you to keep track of a character and his/her wins and losses, money,
  expericene points, abilities, etc.  In general, this suite of programs
  was called a MechForce "headquarters."  Now that the game went
  freeware, there have been two attempts at making the "headquarters"
  easier to use as an integrated package.  Here, I present the version by
  Stefan Hulswitt.  I think it is the best of the two.

    In order to track things like your unit status, unit wealth, each
  character in the unit and his or her individual status, all your mechs,
  your combat record, your unit's contract, and the Hall of Fame, you
  need MechForce HQ.  It does the job admirably, especially for a program
  that claims to only be half written.

    Though the program was written with PAL machines and OS3.0 in mind,
  NTSC and/or OS2.1 machines fare well just the same.  For areas of the
  screen that can't be seen, simply move the mouse to the edge and
  autoscroll to what is hidden.  Furthermore, all information is
  presented neatly on the one screen, with requesters popping up only
  when necessary.

    The presentation is very slick and very easy.  There are gadgets galore
  and a full Intuition menu in addition.  If you can't navigate this
  program... well, you get the point.

    This headquarters allows mech creation and editing.  You can change any
  part of the mech, whether it's one you made from scratch, or one of the
  premade ones found in the archives.  It's all a click away.  You can
  create new characters, remove characters, create or delete units, buy
  abilities with experience points, gain titles and salaries, and lots
  more.  This adds a completely new layer of depth to the MechForce game.
  Heck, it even multitasks and if you've got 1.5 megs or more, you can
  run MechForce from within MechForce HQ and never see Workbench until
  you get sick of the game!

    Stefan has done an admirable job, and I hope he is still developing
  this program, because I would like to see version 1.0.  If you play
  MechForce, you necessarily *must* get this too.

 @{fg shine}Review Begins@{fg text}

    While rummaging around looking for fonts (see related review
  elsewhere), I stumbled across this interesting item.  It is at least as
  old as 1986, maybe before, but it is very funny.

    Disclaimer:  It may be inappropriate for me to review this given the
  racial tensions already existent in the world, especially America, but
  I hope that everyone is realistic enough to realize that this is only
  for fun.  Besides, there's a valley-girl version too (called
  ValSpeak.lha).

    The interface is very crude, and it must run from CLI only.  It takes
  input from standard input.  What this means is that whatever you type
  gets translated line-by-line until you press control-\ to stop.  An
  easier way is to use file redirection to input a regular English file
  and output the new file, like this:

      1> Jive < filename.english > filename.jive

    Then you can read the resulting file.  Here's a sample to end with.
  This is untouched by me and is direct output of the program...

    If ya' wants' some brief diversion and some hilarious fun, ah' advise
  ya' to waaay download some copy uh dis little archive.  What it is,
  Mama!  Oderwise, it would be real bad-ass cuz' ya''d neva' know how
  every new .readme ya' git sounds in Jive.  Right On!

    When browsing Aminet, I tend to download packages in phases.  I might
  get arcade game crazy and download a slew of shoot-em-ups.  I might,
  another time, want a new text reader and download a heap of them.  This
  time it was fonts.  I wanted fonts.  I found them; lots of them.

    I never realized how much was available on Aminet in the realm of
  fonts.  Of course, I don't do much DTP, but I do some art now and
  then.  I didn't want to mess with CompuGraphic fonts, so I looked for
  some bitmap fonts.  These two packages alone will yield about 700K
  worth!

    I have to say that the MLC collection is mostly 8-point fonts.  There
  are > 70 of them.  There are a few bigger ones in there, however (the
  gothic font is especially nice).  As with anything that is designed by
  one person in profusion, there are a few styles that look very similar.
  Overall, though, this is a very diverse package and easily worth the
  download time.

    I was surprised by the quality of the BitmapFonts collection.  Almost
  all of the fonts come in two or more sizes, and almost all are
  strikingly good quality.  I suspect that whoever put this together has
  converted many of them from Mac or IBM sources.  These are definitely
  useful for DTP or screen-titling (though they are unscalable).  This
  archive unpacks to about 500K.

    In both archives, some fonts are full sets (ie, all 256 characters
  defined), and some are not.  There are some that don't have any letters
  except caps and numbers.  That's okay, though, because these are two of
  the best-- and biggest-- packages of bitmap fonts available on Aminet.
