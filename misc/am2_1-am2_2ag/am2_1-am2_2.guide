@{"The Sam Report: Amiga Online?" link samrpt} @{i}@{b}By Sam Ormes@{ub}@{ui}
  The world's largest online service is, without a doubt, America Online.
  However, it is an exclusive organization, available only for Mac OS and
  Windows users, and Amiga-only users need not apply. But in this day of a
  potential Amiga resurgence, one might argue that it is high time for AOL to
  be made available for the Amiga. Sam Ormes, Amiga user and AOL member,
  illustrates further.

@{"Guest Viewpoint: To PPC or not to PPC" link ppc} @{b}@{i}By Tim Molinder@{ui}@{ub}
  As the Amiga prepares to move into the future, questions about processors
  for the next generation, and how to implement them, continue to be raised.
  The PowerPC is certainly among the most likely of contenders, but even
  then, exactly how to make the switch is not entirely clear.

  Jim Kuzma returns to the pages of AM, this month to conclude his
  perspective on the path the personal computer has taken so far, and to give
  his own warning on where, in the face of logic and good sense, it appears
  to be going in the future.

*  An e-mail address to which new issues of AM can be sent, and with which we
   can communicate with you
*  A short description of the site

The Amiga Monitor will gladly publish contributions from other members of the
Amiga community. There are several guidelines we would like you to follow,
however, if you are interested in writing for us.


There are two types of articles we will accept:


1. Prearranged Articles

  1. Contact our Senior Editor, Samuel Ormes, by sending an e-mail message to
     s.ormes@genie.com, in which you express your interest in writing, and
     briefly explain what type of writing you would like to do.
  2. A member of the Editorial Staff will respond to your message with
     information about upcoming deadlines, and a general time frame within
     which we would be working.
  3. You would then send us your article, and assuming there are no serious
     problems, we will publish it. You would be listed for that month in the
     Staff List as a Contributing Writer.


2. Unsolicited Articles

  The Amiga Monitor may, at its discretion, choose to publish articles sent to
  us without any prior contact between the writer and the AM staff. We prefer
  to have you contact us first, but it is not absolutely necessary. If you do
  choose to send in an unsolicited article, @{b}please remember to include your
  name and e-mail address.@{ub} Anonymous submissions will be frowned upon; "pen
  names" and aliases are acceptable, however.

  If you do choose to send an unsolicited article, please send it to
  MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM.



A few notes on article submission...

*  Articles should be written in English.
*  Articles should be sent in ASCII format; HTML codes are permissable.
*  Images are permissable, and in fact welcomed, as judicious use of graphics
   can greatly increase the quality of an article. If you do choose to include
   images, please use IFF, JPEG, or GIF format, and archive your entire
   article with LhA, LZH, or LZX.
*  Personal e-mail signatures, URL's, etc. are permitted to be included in an
   article.
*  Once sent to us, your writing becomes public domain under the AM Reprint
   Policy unless you explicitly request otherwise.
*  We often count on you to come up with specific ideas for articles. Although
   you are welcome to get in contact with us simply to announce your interest
   in writing for us, please do not be surprised if we don't have any specific
   "assignments" for you right away. It is generally best if those who wish to
   write know exactly what they want to write about.


And lastly,

*  It is ultimately at the discretion of the staff of The Amiga Monitor as to
   whether articles will be published.

message to subscribe to the list, or send e-mail to MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM in
which you specify the information given further below:


*  HTML LhA
*  HTML ZIP
*  AmigaGuide LhA

*  If you have an account on CompuServe, America Online, or Genie, specify
   this to have files transferred to you directly. Otherwise, they will be
   sent in UUEncoded form.
*  Please specify the list(s) you would like to join (if you aren't using one
   of the three links above).
*  Although your name is not required, it helps with our record-keeping if you
   include it.
*  The e-mail address to which you would like the files to be sent


If we successfully receive and process your request, you will receive
notification that you have been added to a list. If you do not receive a
response within two weeks, please check to see that your correct e-mail
address is included with the message, and resend your request.


                 @{i}A Few Notes on the Distribution Lists...@{ui}

Our Publisher sends the AM archive out through his mailbox enough times each
month without it coming in several times as well. Please make his life a
little easier, and do your best to prevent bouncebacks:

*  Please notify us if your e-mail address changes.
*  Also, please make sure your provider can handle fairly large attached files.
   The AM archive currently ranges in size anywhere from 50k to 300k. We can
   tolerate it if you have problems with some of the larger ones, but if there
   are consistently problems with smaller archives, we may have to consider
   finding a different way to deliver the magazine to you.


Also, if you are one of our AmigaGuide readers, be warned that since our
primary format is HTML, there will be a delay in the production of
AmigaGuide-format issues (converting HTML to AmigaGuide is not easy, and we
have limited resources). We hope to narrow the gap between the release of HTML
and AmigaGuide versions, but in the meantime, you should be aware that there
is a delay.

The leaves are starting to turn, the days are getting shorter, and there is
a chill in the air. Yes, autumn is gradually setting in here in New York,
and another summer is already memory. Another summer for us, and another
summer for the Amiga. It was certainly an interesting one at that, as for
arguably the first summer in years, the platform appeared to have a measure
of stability, and solid, concrete hopes for the future.

Indeed, it was only a year ago that the Amiga's future was in serious
jeopardy, the platform having felt the collapse of two corporate giants in
too short a time for anything to have been accomplished in the interim.
People were not quite sure what to think about VIScorp's potential
involvement, and they were rightly concerned that there might not be
anybody else out there looking to buy the Amiga technology, and actually
carry it forward.

But in a story that has practically become fable, or perhaps legend,
Gateway 2000 swooped in, apparently out of nowhere, and for all intents and
purposes, gave the Amiga at least a new lease on life.

So we have been left to tread water for a few months, but I greatly admire
Gateway and AI for not appeasing us with vaporware (with all due respect to
the organization of the same name) and other empty promises. A lack of news
is better than news without substance.

But now, in only the last few weeks, Gateway has stepped forward and spoken
to a certain degree on the future of the Amiga. We can now be fairly
confident that there will be new computers bearing the Amiga name, and
though specifics remain largely unknown, it appears that Gateway wishes to
remain true to the Amiga philosophy. Once again, time will tell.

As far as the rest of this issue is concerned, you may have noticed that it
is a combined August/September issue. We had to do this because of some
timing, scheduling, and resource problems, which also caused some promised
items to be bumped. They will appear here eventually, however.

But yes, as the summer here fades away, let us remember that the Amiga's
summer, so to speak, may only be beginning. One cannot make promises or
bold assumptions, especially after everything the Amiga community has been
through, but the platform might just now have its best chances yet. For the
many who have not abandoned ship, you should be congratulated. You stuck
with it, and all that waiting and hoping may soon pay off. In any event, we
should soon have a better idea of just what "Tomorrow's Amiga" will be.

Let's face reality....there is one universal online service and its name is
America Online! Now that it has swallowed CompuServe, it will become even
more overwhelmingly universal.

Only problem is...you can't get there from here! Despite the fact that
Steve Case, the founder and CEO of AOL, got his start by creating Q-Link
which was an early online service specializing in Commodores and Amigas, he
has excluded us from AOL. Many Amigans have strong negative feelings about
Case......understandably.

I wasn't around in the Q-Link days and I don't bear that emotional baggage.
When I inherited an old Macintosh last November, I decided to give AOL a
try. After some years on Genie (a totally text-based service) which has
(had) a strong Amiga presence, the graphical AOL experience was
life-changing!

Although AOL has no Amiga forums as does CompuServe, I spend maybe 70% of
my time online there involved in Amiga matters. This includes reading the
Amiga newsgroups, reading all our wonderful sites such as AWD, Fishwrap,
amiCrawler, etc. and especially chatting online real-time with fellow
Amigans about Amigas. E-mail with my friends is a snap on AOL and that
often includes exchanging Amiga graphics as attached files.

Obviously I like AOL. What I do not like is having to access it exclusively
on another platform, and now I am finally getting to the point I wanted to
make. The time has come..... with AOL absorbing CompuServe and its Amiga
areas, and with a major player like Gateway owning our Amiga..... for
America Online to be made available to Amigans everywhere!

I hereby challenge our new friends in South Dakota to use their clout to
make this happen....to get this exclusion ended and bring their new baby
closer to the mainstream in this new era of online communications. Let's
make "Back for the future" a meaningful slogan.

@{i}As the Amiga prepares to move into the future, questions about processors
for the next generation, and how to implement them, continue to be raised @{ui}

      By Tim Molinder, Contributing Writer, tmolinder@earthlink.net

@{U}                                                                           @{UU}

Now that the question of who will own the Amiga has been resolved attention
must turn to the future of the platform. All of the Amiga's components,
after many years of neglect, need upgrading. The processor, graphics,
sound, and OS all combine to determine what price and capabilities users
expect. This is the first in a series of articles that will explore each of
these systems and speculate on directions Amiga International, AI for
short, and third parties might take based on my own thoughts and opinions
as a professional Amiga user since 1988. The CPU more than any single
factor determines system speed. The Motorola 680x0 series powers the Amiga
but since the '060 is the last of this series a new chip must step up to
replace it. The major contender, the PowerPC, was anointed successor by
Amiga Technologies before the Escom bankruptcy and remains the front
runner. With Phase 5 already well on the way to delivering the first
PPC-powered Amiga accelerator cards, what path should the Amiga take to its
new processor home?

Follow the leader. Apple has made a successful transition through software
emulation. This allows a clean break with the 680x0 and gives developers a
strong incentive to port their software. The emulator allows current
applications to run and all that is required is designing a new A4000
processor card and new A1200 motherboard.

A second approach has been proposed by phase 5 with its PowerUp boards. A
680x0 chip and PPC chip are combined on the same board allowing current
code to run at native speeds while new software can access the PPC. Phase 5
has done a significant amount of work in providing a PowerPC development
environment and ported versions of its CyberGraphX software. A PPC-native
Workbench and PPC-native application software, while the logical next step,
are not required for users to benefit from PPC acceleration. This allows
more time to make significant upgrades to Workbench and AmigaDOS while
developers can quickly bring PPC-accelerated applications to the market.

Both approaches have advantages. A clean non-680x0 approach through
software emulation sounds attractive but is fraught with peril. Apple got
lucky and numerous developers ported their code to PPC. The emulator barely
worked and even when it did programs ran slow. Are Amiga users going to buy
a new $2000 Power Amiga if it runs Lightwave or Imagine slower than a stock
A1200? While Apple had a healthy market and aggressive developers to push
the users through the transition quickly the Amiga has an anemic market and
relatively few active developers. How many will spend the time or money to
port to PPC until the number of users becomes a viable market?

In contrast the phase 5 dual processor PPC boards have the advantage of
running existing applications as fast or faster than previously while
providing a path to even greater speed with PPC-native code. Developers can
transition parts of programs which can benefit the most from the PPC's
speed right away without having to port the whole code. More importantly
development can begin immediately without a complete a PPC port of
Workbench and AmigaDOS. While phase 5 has developed libraries to allow
software to use the PPC this is not a completed port of the Amiga operating
system. Even more exciting are the possibilities of PPC and 680x0
processors working together with the PPC spared from the task of running
the OS and free to devote all of its speed to applications code. In fact
this may be a stepping stone to a multi-processor Amiga. Is there a
downside? A problem arises if developers continue to produce 680x0-only
code and the incentive to port Workbench and AmigaDOS wanes. The
alternative is waiting for the PPC versions. But is it important to have a
PPC Workbench and AmigaDOS since Workbench runs at a speedy clip even on an
'020? It's applications software like Lightwave and ImageFX that need the
speed boost. Each successive version of the OS would become more and more
PPC-native until eventually all of it runs on the PPC. The vacancy left by
the departing 680x0 processor could be filled with a second PPC making the
Amiga a dual-processor system like the BeBox. A radical application of this
approach would be the addition of other types of processors. If a 680x0 and
PPC can coexist why not a DEC Alpha or Pentium chip or even systems with
all three. Windows 95, Windows NT, Linux, and MacOS could all run together
as tasks of the Amiga Operating System much as Emplant and ShapeShifter run
MacOS. Users could use any application regardless of the operating system.
The PowerUp board proves that the core OS and applications need not us
e the same processor or type and software tasks can be divided between
them. Not only is this the best way for the Amiga to transition to the PPC
but also points the way to a new future for the Amiga.

As a footnote an upgrade letter arrived from Impulse this weekend as I was
finishing this article. It described the features in the upcoming Imagine
6.0 and one little line caught my attention: PowerPC support! Developers
are catching PPC fever and while no specific mention was made of phase 5's
boards, since they are the only announced PPC devices for the Amiga, it
seems logical to assume that the reference is to them. It's an exciting
thing to see a developer who was on the verge of canceling its Amiga
version come roaring back into the market. While Imagine has its flaws I
encourage all past and present users to give it a serious look and upgrade
as I have. Kudos to Impulse!

(...continued)

So now we are faced with operating systems so large that it takes a CD-ROM
(or two or six) just to load them. Megs are now gigs, and you need 10
gigabytes of disk, 30 megabytes of ram, and a Pentium running at hundreds
of megahertz just to be able to click on an icon and not fall asleep
waiting for something to happen. Just a few days ago, an audible gasp was
heard from a spectator as I typed a command from a DOS prompt. Speed and
features are everything to me on a workstation, and why would I want to run
a Windows version of a perfectly good CAD package? To make it slower? To
force me to buy a bigger machine? Ah, there's the reason. Code bloat, lack
of concern over speed of execution, and laziness has lead us to believe
that the latest releases are better, and if they are too slow, just buy a
faster machine. Both industries in hardware and software are in cahoots.
One can't exist without the other, and they are in a symbiotic and mindless
rush towards inefficiency.

Bugs are nevermore to be corrected, releases come faster than they can be
installed, and closets are full of dust-collecting processors, which only
years ago were eagerly bought as the latest and greatest available, and
wasted more time than they saved while they were running. Who cares if a
two thousand-dollar active matrix display doesn't last three years? By that
time, the machine will be useless anyway. You won't even be able to type
DIR. But the new ones will still have windows that jump behind the desktop
and scroll bars that hop to the top of the file when the arrow leaves its
border. Yeah, yeah, that's what I want!

One of these days, some enterprising and brilliant software company will
boil all the fat off of the operating systems and release a compatible
platform that will efficiently run programs in a graphics environment
multitasked. But wait, isn't that what AmigaDOS did over a decade ago? No
wonder that machine still has devotees. It's nice to work with. But the
world is Windows now and you won't find many Amigas on desks, or laptops
running AmigaDOS. It's a shame.

I'm being dragged, kicking and screaming, into the quagmire. I'm forced to
contract software development for Windows that costs a fortune. I'm forced
to run new hardware accessories in Windows because they aren't supported
anywhere else. But I'm content to write this article in DOS in my favorite
text editor that I use to write everything but e-mail. It will always be
fast because it was fast on an XT. The macros I wrote over the decade still
serve me well, and I don't have to unlearn them and "upgrade" to something
different. I can still buy a used machine for a few hundred dollars that
gets all of my work done, and it will all fit on the puny, uselessly small
drive that no one else wants. Well, I've always been a hoarder, a repairer
of old and solid appliances that continue to operate for twenty or thirty
years after they were thrown away. Maybe I'm just an anachronism fated to
be left behind in the dust while the rest of the world gallops full speed
ahead. But, it sure looks like there's a cliff over there.

Maybe I'll have some satisfaction. I am, after all, a control systems
designer. Maybe my obsessions with efficiency, longevity, reliability and
ease of use will be the key differences that make our products stand out in
a crowd. I can only hope that those qualities are still in demand in this
throw-away world.

       @{i}We found something interesting on an Amiga site recently...@{ui}

        By Michael Webb, Editor-in-Chief, MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM

@{U}                                                                           @{UU}

Recently, in my travels upon the World Wide Web, I happened upon a
particular page that had more than met the eye.

It is called "the Broken web site," Internet home to an Amiga-oriented
organization by that name ("Broken"), and the URL is
http://www.crystal.com.au/~hweight/. If you follow a link to their "News"
page, an item dated October 2, 1997 gives a cryptic description of
something on the site.

As it turns out, it is a riddle, the answer to which lies somewhere between
the site itself, and the web visitor's creativity. I was able to figure out
part of the trick, but haven't had much time to explore further. I thought
I would feature this particular site here, however, in case we have any
great code-crackers/deriddlers out there in the Amiga community that would
like to give it a try.

How do you find the answer? Well, I can't tell you. After all, that
wouldn't be fair, would it? But I can tell you there is a clue in this
article.

 This could, incidentally, be the start of a regular department in which we
feature one or several Amiga-oriented sites each month. Such things are all
in the planning stages, but keep that in mind for the future, especially if
you have an Amiga page with your own unique twist to it. Riddles not
required, of course...

Other than that, if you do try to solve the riddle, good luck!

@{i}A true story about challenges to security and administration in the modern
                               Internet age@{ui}

                 By Robert Davis, bobdavis@cadvantage.com

@{U}                                                                           @{UU}

Like Cliff Stoll's book, @{u}@ LARGE@{uu} begins with a Unix System Administrator on
the left coast of the United States suffering difficulties with a computer
cracker. Also like Cliff Stoll's experience, the sysadmin has huge problems
getting law enforcement interested in investigating.

Unlike the earlier story, in this one the sysadmin actually finds out who
is tormenting his system. The cracker is a young man in the sysadmin's own
city, and is well-known to some of the staff at the university in Portland,
Oregon, where the affected computer system exists. The cracker never does
intentional damage, but some of his programs-gone-awry crash computers on
the Internet, forcing other sysadmins to cut off net access to hundreds of
people and he generally makes life miserable for thousands of people all
over the United States who try to use the Internet for work or play.

University computer systems, networked government systems, even machines
which could have been used to accidently trigger floods and medical
emergencies were penetrated by the cracker. At one time, the entire source
code for the Sun operating system Solaris was stolen (downloaded) but the
cracker did not have a big enough hard drive on his own machine for the
hundreds of megabytes of data. When the cracker stored the source on a
networked computer, he picked one which itself was short of hard drive
room, and the crash of that computer was one of the clues which eventually
led to his undoing.

At one point, with the FBI wiretapping the cracker, his data communication
became unintelligible to the law enforcers. FBI officials thought he had
started using some sort of encrypted 'stealth' modem. Actually, he had
purchased a higher speed modem, but never could get the thing to work
right. He went back to his old, slower, modem and the FBI was back in the
wiretapping business.

@{u}@ LARGE@{uu} is a true story, and has enough technical detail to keep most of us
nerds engrossed with specifics of the shortcomings in Internet security. It
also has adequate explanation of the technical stuff to allow non-techies
to understand the problems a Unix sysadmin goes through to keep his system
both secure from outside attack and freely open so legitimate users are not
frustrated by extreme system security.

By the way, with the expected release of Holger Kruse's new version of
Miami late in 1997, some Amiga owners are going to have to learn about
network security. The new Miami will allow Amiga owners to run network
server applications with ease not currently available to users of the
rather hard-to-set-up AmiTCP/IP. @{u}@ LARGE@{uu} is a good book to read just to get
an idea of what hard work it is to keep a machine on the Internet around
the clock, providing services to others.

Much of the book covers a two-year period in the early 1990's, mostly 1991
and 1992. Eventually the FBI did get into the investigation. In fact, the
FBI planned to make the capture and prosecution of the cracker a test case
to show the effectiveness of the new federal law which attempts to keep
nefarious persons from messing with others' computer systems. The authors
even quote from 18 U.S.C. 1030 (Fraud and Related Activity in Connection
with Computers), section (A) (S) (a) on page 53.

But the big high-profile case came apart when the FBI discovered the
identity of the cracker. There was no prosecution. Why there was no
prosecution of such a serious case of Internet cracking is a large part of
@{u}@ LARGE@{uu}.

Freedman and Mann tell a good story. The book is easy and interesting to
read. This is one of those few books which I had to read in one setting,
from start to the bibliography. @ LARGE is worth your attention.

@{b}Overview:@{ub}

Nemac IV: The Director's Cut is a Doom-clone in the sci-fi Marathon vein.
Your task is to infiltrate Nemac IV, an automated defense installation gone
haywire. The installation will vigorously defend itself with armies of
robots and embedded systems. Your task, as in all such shooters, is to kill
everything that moves and survive to the exit.

@{b}Requirements:@{ub}

To quote; "Any Amiga computer with 68020 or better, AmigaOS 2.0 or better,
2MB of Memory and 5MB on Harddisk." Worth noting is that a CD-ROM is also
required, both to install the game and to run the animations while
playing.

@{b}System Used For Test:@{ub}

A4060T, 18MB RAM, CV64/3D 4MB, 4X SCSI CD-ROM.

@{b}The Good Stuff, Part One:@{ub}

Nemac IV is a model of good behavior on the installation and
OS-friendliness end. It installs easily off the CD-ROM, supports OCS, ECS
and AGA machines, supports Picasso and CyberGraphX standards, supports 3D
I-glasses and has a great configuration window. From this window you can
set the screen mode, activate I-glasses support, choose to go with CPU or
CPU+Blitter, set-up your keyboard or joystick, and basically do everything
but set window-size. This is actually a good thing, because the opening
animation is a bit finicky. Depending on your configuration, it has very
definite ideas about the window-size it wants to play smoothly in. On my
machine, it played best quarter-screen on an 800x600 CGX screen, or a
640x512 PAL or NTSC screen off AGA. Actually, the AGA playback was never as
good as the CGX, a theme throughout the game. As to the opening animation
itself, it was impressive work accompanied by a powerful synth soundtrack.
Cranked through my 3-piece Yamaha set, it annoyed everyone in the house!

@{b}The Good Stuff, Part Two:@{ub}

Unlike any other Doom-clone, Nemac IV puts you in the perspective of a
'Walker,' rather like those of Mechwarrior fame. The theme is complete down
to the deep bass 'boom-boom-boom' as you walk, which imparts an enjoyable
sense of rhythm and power to your movement. There are guns on each side of
the Walker and their animation is very nicely done. The game also has sharp
textures, which allowed great latitude in window-resizing. I was able to
play in a 320x256 CGX screen with the game window expanded to practically
full-screen on a 17-inch monitor. Even so, the image was not seriously
degraded, and the game ran very fast. The same could not be said if you
tried to play on a 640x480 screen with window-size bumped-up. Although the
window's default size is 320x240, expanding it on a 640x480 screen resulted
in the game becoming a slideshow.

Aside from the sharp textures, Nemac IV had better-looking sprites than
most Amiga Doom-clones, though they are still a far cry from those of Doom
or Marathon. I'm not quite sure what the problem is, but basically, the
monsters in Amiga Doom-style games leave a lot to be desired. Partly making
up for this, the game has excellent explosions and some nice associated
physics. Blasting a toxic barrel gives an impressive and thunderous blast
accompanied by dead robots shooting across the floor! Really cool!
Unusually, you can also move the barrels around -- supposedly an important
consideration in later levels.

Wrapping things up on the graphics end, the CD-ROM contains over 90
screenshots done in 640x512. They must have been playing on a top-secret
multiprocessing miggy when they took those! Also, there are 18 rendered
images, some of truly photorealistic quality. Very nice work.

In terms of gameplay, the controls are very smooth. I set all my movement
keys on the numeric keypad, since it offers easy and smooth
circle-strafing, i.e., circling an enemy while keeping it constantly under
fire. Alas, this strategy proved less effective in Nemac IV than in Doom,
since nearly all the enemies have rapid-fire weapons and many of them tend
to spray fire all over the place. Oh well. As to the feel, Nemac IV gives a
good sensation of straight-ahead, rapid-fire carnage. However.......

@{b}The Bad Stuff, Part One:@{ub}

It's actually generous to call this game a Doom clone, since it only has a
Wolfenstein-grade engine. The only vertical variable I noticed in 12 levels
was ceiling height. Although one assumes the floor could be varied as well,
perhaps the engine uses some sort of inflexible deckplane-style reference.
In any case, the levels are all flat mazes. Further, aside from the
complete lack of stairs, there's also no windows, nor is there open sky.
Lighting effects? Nope, not even sector-based lighting. Nor did I see any
animated textures. Basically, very little in the way of cool architecture
or mood-building atmosphere. Even if an editor existed for this game, it
would offer little for the budding designer to work with.

The level design itself is mostly quite pedestrian. The first seven levels
are for practice, and while not entirely lacking in charm, they have little
to recommend them against games with a superior engine. The gameplay is
very easy in these early levels as well, and even though three difficulty
settings (Normal, Hard and Impossible) are offered, I saw very little
difference between them. However, the designers began to cheat, making the
levels harder by hiding necessary powerups behind secret doors. Most of
these are nearly impossible to find since there's no visual cue, such as a
texture offset or lighting variance, to betray them.

Level 7 is fairly difficult and has a nail-biter ending. After this, the
gloves come off. Level 10 is a grueling adventure and Level 12 starts you
under heavy fire, after which it only gets worse.

Making life all the more insufferable is that games can only be saved
between levels. While some purists (masochists) enjoy the high difficulty
this gives a game, the fact is that for most players it's just frustrating
and boring. It would be one thing if skill alone could get you through, but
3D shooters have a high 'random factor.' They never play the same way
twice. You can get practically to the end of a level, then get whacked, and
then take five more tries just to get back where you were. In the case of
Nemac IV, you'll quickly lose interest because the levels themselves are
fairly dull. In Doom parlance, they would be termed 'room-by-room'
shooters. Open a door, shoot at the enemies inside, then go in and mop up
the survivors -- again and again and again. Better level design would offer
tripwire traps and complex moving sectors, where you suddenly find yourself
surrounded by enemies, but these are not found here.

As luck would have it, the enemies also have terrible AI. They cannot turn
corners or open doors. Their typical 'see through walls once awakened'
line-of-sight tracking actually causes them to crash into walls and get
stuck. It's almost tragic to watch their little metal feet scraping
uselessly against the ground as they try to burrow through the walls.
Oddly, this actually makes the game more difficult. In Doom, the superior
movement routines of the enemy can bring them to the doorway, where you can
wait and pick them off. Not so in Nemac IV. You have to blast them to
smithereens from outside, but eventually plunge in only to find enemies
freeing themselves from the walls to fire on you.

The enemies also have no personality. They aren't named in the manual, so
you really have no prior notion what you're up against before plunging into
action. Without doubt, the most annoying enemy is what looks like a
'walking rangefinder,' or perhaps a surveyor's telescope. This critter has
a pistol on it somewhere that creates an ungodly racket. Get a few of these
in a room and they can drive you insane. Most of the enemies are also quite
weak. There is a flying teakettle robot with a plasma gun that will account
for most of your deaths, along with a tough but seldom-encountered Walker
sporting dual plasma guns. Other than that, you really only need to watch
out for the 'flying bombs' that resemble giant floating cough drops.

Alas, the game is unambitious in the sound department. There is no music
for the levels, no ambient sounds, and the enemies make no noise except the
sound of their firing.

@{b}The Bad Stuff, Part Two:@{ub}

Then there's the bugs. Like, call an exterminator for this one! Nemac IV is
the buggiest game I've encountered on any platform. First, it was the
annoying 'ammo bug.' This one caused my maximum bullet allowance to drop
from 800 to 256 once I grabbed bullets on Level 3. Then came the bugs in
the clipping and drawing routines. Nemac IV seems uncommonly prone to
narrow vertical texture rips around sharp edges. This is true of all
texture-mappers, but more in Nemac than the others I've played. Also, if
you stretch the window to an odd size, you'll get 'hall of mirrors' effects
around wall edges, notably on AGA screens. Using an odd-sized window can
also make the doors too small for their openings. If there are any monsters
behind these doors, they will see you and open fire, where normally they
wouldn't. One positive side effect is that thin slivers of light can betray
the otherwise unfindable secret doors!

The biggest clipping bug I encountered was on Level 5, where I was able to
walk right through a solid wall! Otherwise, there seems to be a flaw in
collision-detection with closing doors. You can easily run through a
mostly-closed door, or shoot grenades through it. Once, I saw a flying
teakettle pass like a ghost through a door almost completely shut.

Most recently the game has suffered audio and movement bugs that bring the
whole affair to a halt and cause a crash on quitting. Another bug (after a
recent re-install) can see you start a level surrounded by corrupt
textures. You can count the seconds until the crash. Then there's a bug
where, if you play several levels in a row, the game can 'load up' and
temporarily slow to a crawl.

I took out MCP and most other tools, as the docs suggest, but the bugs
persist. Your mileage may vary. Chances are that the A4000 design has some
problems here as well.

@{b}Summary:@{ub}

Nemac IV is a promising first effort by Zentek. They did a lot of things
right, but these were outweighed by the things they did wrong. Even if the
game was less buggy, it would still suffer from a PreCambrian engine,
third-rate level design, poor enemies and an overall sense of boredom by
comparison to similar, but superior games. It shows, yet again, why no Doom
clone has quite matched the original game. As usual, concentration is
placed on extraneous 'features,' such as cool explosions (in this case)
while gameplay takes a back seat. This game also lacks support for
deathmatch and co-op play online, vastly reducing its lastability. Also, I
think it's a good idea for Amiga Doom-clones to include level editors,
rather than hoping a third-party programmer writes one. With a level editor
provided, it might be possible for players to stretch the engine a bit and
get more mileage and excitement out of the game.

I think Nemac IV should also serve as a warning to the teams behind
Brainkiller and Genetic Species. Really guys, it's awfully late in the day
to be bringing out souped-up Wolfensteins, and it's getting later by the
minute. Please, take a look at Breathless, or Trapped 2, and if you still
can, get at least a variance in floor and ceiling heights, then throw in
stairs, windows, and sky textures. We'd really like that, hint-hint. :>

@{b}Highs:@{ub} OS-friendly, easy install, cool animated opening, great
       configuration window, sharp textures, smooth controls.

@{b}Lows:@{ub}  Terrible enemy AI, obsolete Wolfenstein engine, lack of atmosphere,
       supremely buggy and ultimately, just plain boring.
