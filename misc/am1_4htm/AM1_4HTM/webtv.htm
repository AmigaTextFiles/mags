<P>Recently I was at a store that had a WebTV hooked up.  I decided to play
with the thing for a while, and had so much fun that I bought one.  Not
quite that shaver guy, but we do what we can with what we have.</P>

<P>A WebTV is a set-top box for "surfin'" the web.  A set - top box is basically
what it says it is: a box that sits on top of a television set.  WebTV is
about the size of a Nintendo game machine.  It connects to your TV via RCA
plugs, or you can buy an S-Video cable, or use an RF modulator.  It uses
standard telephone lines to connect to a local provider affiliated with
WebTV.  You control your surfing with a remote control very similar to a tv
remote control, or you can buy a keyboard to use with it.</P>

<P>The concept is simple.  You use your TV set to surf the world wide web.
This unit costs about $330, and is much cheaper than going out and buying
a PC with Netscape.  Or, in our case, getting AmigaOS 3.x, and going
through the torturous installation process of the current crop of surfers.
Although cost effectiveness is your call.</P>

<P>This concept of using the TV set as a surfer is a halfway decent idea.
 Although the images on the screen are not as sharp as they would be on a
standard monitor, most Amiga users use an RGB monitor, so we wouldn't
notice much of a difference.  All normal surfer functions are available,
although they may work in a different way if you use just the remote
control.  On WebTV, when you attempt to go to a random URL, a virtual
keyboard appears on the screen.  This keyboard allows you to select all
normal keyboard characters, and a few extra functions.  However, if you
plan to send any e-mail at all, you need to use a real keyboard.  WebTV
uses an IR remote keyboard containing all normal characters, plus several
extra functions.  You can also plug an IBM PS/2 keyboard into the back of
the box as well, but then the functions are not labelled on the keys.  Plus
you wouldn't be able to sit across the room from the big screen TV.</P>

<P>WebTV can only view pages, not download them.  They do have plans for
future expansion.  They have a slot in the front of the machine that will
supposedly allow you to insert your credit card, and buy things from the
online stores.  There is also a port on the side of the machine that will
allow you to connect a printer to the machine.  That is all they admit to
right now.  According to some press releases, they do not see a market for
connecting a floppy or hard drive to the machine.  That is unfortunate, as
it dismisses a large potential market.  Those of us who would use the WebTV
as our sole online provider will not be able to download files and transfer
them to our computer.  Personally, I use WebTV to find files I would like
to download, and send the website addresses to my Genie address, and then
use Lynx to download the files.  Not pretty, but it works.</P>

<P>There are several other set-top box manufactures who have announced
products, including VIScorp.  Some say that they will include interfaces
that allow you to connect items like ZIP drives to the box. There is quite
a bit of potential in this market, both for non-users, and those who have
computers that are difficult to connect to the web, such as machines like the old
Atari 8 bits and C64's.  Time will tell how all this pans out.</P>

<P>I titled this article with a portion of a quote that dates back to the
American Civil War (I think.)  Get there with the quickest and the mostest.
WebTV (Philips/Magnavox and Sony) got here the quickest.  So far, they
have the mostest, too.  Time will tell whether or not others get into the
market.  VIScorp, the company that is rumored to be the new owners of Amiga
Technologies, needs to get on the playing field soon.  They announced their
set-top box about a year ago, and have a picture of their box on their
website.  To compete with WebTV, all companies need to get to the battle
field soon, and with more than what WebTV offers.  VIScorp is correct, this
market can save the Amiga.  But they need to be in the market in order to
make any money at it.  And this kind of item will sell primarily in the
Christmas season.  Less than four weeks until the busiest shopping day of
the year.</P>
