<P>This month I will cover the subject of "Telnet".   What is it?
Basically, you are logging onto another computer over the internet and
using it as if it were sitting on your desk. The computer you are
sitting at is called the "local" computer. The other one (the one you
are connected to) is called a  "remote" computer.  The term "remote"
is used whether the computer is across the room or across the planet.
It just means that you are not physically present at the other
computer.</P>

<P>Telnet is very easy to use. Just type "telnet". You will be
given a prompt "telnet>."  Next type "open" followed by the host that
you want to connect to.  For example, "open fedworld.gov".  You can
also type directly into the command line, that is telnet followed by
the host name.  For example "telnet fedworld.gov".  You will be logged
onto a federal government BBS.  If you don't have an account, (you
probably don't) enter "new".  After reading some rules, you will be
prompted to enter your name and address.  You will then be asked to
provide a password. You now have an account on a remote system.  Have
fun and explore!</P>

<P>When using Telnet you must also understand what port
number means. A port is a connection between devices. This can also be
used to signal to a computer that you have logged on to use a
particular program.  For instance, there is a program that gives
latitude and longitude as well as population for a town.  The program
is located at "martini.eecs.umich.edu 3000". The 3000 tells the remote
host to run the program described.  You don't need to know the name of
the program or anything else about it to use it.  Once you are logged
on you can type "help" or "?". Either of these will give you
information on how to use the program. The following has been
abridged:</P>

<P>Interpret server replies as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
0 &lt;city name&gt;
1 &lt;county FIPS code&gt; &lt;county name&gt;
2 &lt;state/province abbreviation&gt; &lt;state/province name&gt;
3 &lt;nation abbreviation&gt; &lt;nation name&gt;
A &lt;telephone area code&gt;
E &lt;elevation in feet above mean sea level&gt;
F &lt;feature code&gt; &lt;feature name&gt;
L &lt;latitude DD MM SS X&gt; &lt;longitude DDD MM SS X&gt;
P &lt;1980 census population&gt;
R &lt;remark&gt;
T &lt;time zone&gt;
Z &lt;postal ("ZIP") code&gt;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Enter the town, state and zip and the program will return some
information.  For example I used "Garwood, NJ 07027." The program
replied:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
garwood, nj 07027
0 Garwood
1 34039 Union
2 NJ New Jersey
3 US United States
F 45 Populated place
L 40 39 34 N  74 19 24 W
P 4752
E 100
Z 07027

<P>Some interesting stuff!  The biggest advantage I can see for telnet is
to run programs on another computer that you don't have or that would
take a long time searching databases, for example.   Well, I hope you
enjoyed this month's column. See you next month!</P>
