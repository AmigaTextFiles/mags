<CENTER><H1><I>Editor's Notes...</I></H1></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"I stand upon the threshold, in search of resolution, conscious of little beyond my 
own plight, my own struggle, the essence of that for which I have labored and toiled for so long; the 
future is nearly realized, the days to come are almost upon us, and the results shall become indelibly 
engraved upon history, regardless of whether they are consummated in fire or ice, in success or 
failure..."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">And where is the Amiga? In more or less the same place it was a month ago (big 
surprise). One is left wondering if this will ever end, or as in the case of children born during the 
Depression or World War II, it seems as though what now exists is the only way it ever has been, and 
the only way it ever shall be.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I don't know about that, though...something is probably going to happen. And I 
honestly think it will probably be soon.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are into strangely connected events, just for the fun of it, you may recall 
that last month I mentioned the New York Yankees having their first real World Series shot in quite a 
long time, and drew an analogy with the Amiga. Well, they went on to win it all. Will the Amiga follow 
suit? Only time will tell.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's truly amazing how much can happen in a month while nothing happens at all. 
For instance, the Yankees won the World Series, Bill Clinton was reelected President of the United 
States, it snowed in the southern U.S. where it hardly ever does in any quantity, and the Amiga stood 
still. I would advise you to keep your eyes open, however, because if the Amiga doesn't return soon, 
its chances of success will be greatly dimished, slim as they already are.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On to issues of this month's Issue, you'll find a number of interesting and varied 
items in this issue. Among other things, we would like to welcome Sidewinder as a contributing writer. 
He even got published twice in this issue, actually.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One final thing I would like to mention here is that I received a request to be 
added to one of the AM distribution lists this month, and when I attempted to reply to the person, the 
E-Mail address proved defective. I tried as many variations as I could think of, with no success. The 
reason I mention this is explained in the masthead above: if you send me a message and get no 
response within a week, please check your E-Mail address in your E-Mail software, and resend the 
message. I would like to avoid any more "lost" requests. In the meantime, if anybody has ever heard 
of a provider that is called something like "weynet," kindly let me know what the entire domain name 
is.</P>

<P>But until then, let us proceed without further delay into the November 1996 issue of The Amiga 
Monitor.</P>
