    @{b}AMIGA UPDATE@{ub}


A PERIOD OF WAIT
- No announcement has yet been made of an Amiga or Commodore take-over.
Samsung is expected to be holding the reigns, and a Usenet-posted message
in the past couple of days says that one distributor has alread been told
of a deal and that Commodore is now a division of Samsung.

DEVELOPMENT HALTED
- SAS has brought development of their Amiga C compiler to a halt as
uncertainity continues. Other platforms still have backing.

    @{b}INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS@{ub}


SMALLER SPEND SUCCESS
- As major console pushers lower their advertising budgets in Europe, it
seems that there will be less television campaigning and more muscle for
press and poster promotion. Nintendo's Warioland for the Game Boy leapt
straight to the console number one position in its first days with this
'minimalist' approach.

PIRATES ON THE HIGH CDs
- ELSPA has warned multimediarists about the threat of CD piracy, telling
retailers to be on their guard for bootleg discs. Seven police raids have
been held in recent weeks and six arrests have been made. Pirates are using
CDs' storage advantage to compile software with a retail value of £20,000.

GAMETEK GOES MOVIELAND
- Gametek has formed Gametek Cinema and Kidstuff Cinema labels to publish
thirty Video CD titles this year. Included in signings are Charlie Chaplin
material and Fritz Lang's Metropolis.

MICROSOFT ON DEMAND
- Microsoft has announced its Tiger software for PCs which will offer access
to video-on-demand services at a claimed fraction of the cost of technology
developed by companies such as IBM and HP.

CD STORAGE TIMES TEN
- IBM scientists claim to have developed a CD which can hold ten times as
much as current discs - taking it to  one million pages of text, 12 hours
of music and several movies; all with a seek time of 10 seconds maximum.
The product is thicker, using layer techniques to store more.

T17 KEEPS CONSOLE CLEAR
- Team 17, small-time big-time developers, have said that they plan to
continue to avoid 16-bit consoles. Offers have been made to convert
best-selling Amiga games, but they have turned them down for the sake of
quality control, saying 16-bit console world "is past its sell by sale".

GOOD NEWS
- Amiga and PC sales rose in April while cartridges fell. Sega dropped
2.8% to 23%, while Amiga increased from 19.6% to 21%. PC format sales have
passed the SNES - 12.5% against 12.2% for third place. The CD32 took 49.5%
of CD game sales, followed by the PC on 28.7% and Mega CD at 19.2% - down
22.6% in just three months!

    @{b}RETAIL WINDOW@{ub}


JAGUAR RUMBLINGS
- Rumbelows is expected to stock the Jaguar in the UK. The first batch of
around 1,700 will continue to go to independent retailers, but these numbers
are still low for an official launch. Distributor SDL has suggested an RRP
of £249 - £20 more than earlier planned - because of import by air. Atari
have blamed production problems for low numbers - the US only had a tenth of
the promised half million last year.

FUNNY OLD GAME
- Infogrames are making a late-announced addition to a number now nearing
20 games appearing around the time of the World Cup. Real World Football
will appear on Amiga 1200, CD32 and PC to offer a first-person perspective
simulation of pitch action. It has been developed by Condor Software of
France.

Subject: DeepSpace V1.2


TITLE

         DeepSpace

VERSION

         V1.2

AUTHOR

         Todd & Darrell Neumiller
         (Darrell Neumiller - neumille@hpspkla.spk.hp.com)

DESCRIPTION

      DeepSpace is a Shell/CLI multi-player, multi-node BBS, space roll 
      playing game.  Real time fighting, chat and etc.  You can have up to
      20 players playing the game at the same time.  Only 10 players are
      allowed to play a game in the unregisted version, and up to 100 
      users after DeepSpace has been registered.  If your BBS can't run
      a Shell/CLI door, we have a Paragon door version too.  You can also
      play DeepSpace locally from a SHELL while other players are playing
      the game at the same time.

FEATURES

      - Documentation is in Amigaguide format.
      - Easy to use installation program.
      - On-line Editor for players, aliens and planets.
      - Up to 50 definable names for Alien races can be used in a game.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

      We haven't finished everything we originally set out to accomplish 
      with DeepSpace.  Here is a few of our version 2 enhancement ideas.

      - If you go through the BlackHole when it's un-stable (and make it 
        through) you will see the planet 'Praxis'.  The players will be
        able beam to/from the planet.  Hostile Mutants, Aliens and on-line 
        players could be on the planet.  Different objects could be obtained
        there, Weapons, Crystals, and Better Scanners? ect..  An example 
        that's being considered: A weapon that can be left at the DeepSpace
        port, which could be programmed, via DNA scan, to detonate when a 
        certain Explorer arrives at the port.
      - Gambling at the DeepSpace port.  Possibly against other on-line
        players as well.
      - The Shap Shifter could be anywhere!  Could be selling illegal
        items from planet Praxis?  Could end up in jail with no way out,
        or will there be a way out?

     Fido:   2:244/6302.12


DESCRIPTION

DFA is the ultimate address utility for every AMIGA computer that runs
at least Workbench 2.0. Native languages are supported as soon as one
has installed Workbench 2.1 and above; Workbench 3.0 will be
supported, if is available. DFA is not like any other address tool. It
is an ideal combination of a lot of features and an easy to use
program. Inspite of this combination it tries to use even less RAM
than former versions of DFA.

Registered  users  will  get  a  keyfile  that  enables  saving of the
DFA-Preferences, which is disabled in the public release.

DFA  should  be  installed  using  the  provided  install  script. The
installer program ((c) Commodore) is included!

FEATURES

- Arexx port that understand more than 30 commands
- Arexx scripts can be bound to function keys
- Support of up to three email addresses
- Can dial the stored telephone numbers
- Prints your addresses in several different formats
- All windows  are  fully  font sensitive
- Locale support (german and english)
- Supports OS3.x if available
- Context sensitive online help
- AMIGAGUIDE and TEX documentation; both english and german

NEW FEATURES

- Extended client server mechanism.
- Address grouping
- Complete rewrite of the DFA Arexx port
- Toolbox
- Address listview can be configured
- Added a configurable panel listview
- c/O and state field added
- Support of "external" files
- Search function improved
- The dial function was rewritten from scratch.
- The  load and the save routine were sped up a lot.
- Optimized memory usage (Memory pools etc.)
- Simple network support
- Seperate preferences program
- 8-color MagicWB icons by Martin 'XEN' Huttenloher.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

DFA needs at least Kickstart/Workbench 2.04 to run.

It takes advantage of the new features included in version 2.1
(Locale  support)  and  uses even some features coming with OS
3.0 if available.

DFA is made to run on all all systems, starting with the A500+
and ending up with the A4000(T).

More than 512KB of RAM and a harddisk is recommended.

HOST NAME

     wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4)

PRICE

Shareware fee:                         DM        US$

Program itself........................30.00     20.00
     Printed manual (optional):

Outside of Europe, AND MANUAL.........15.00     10.00

See documentation for additional information.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

DFA is NOT PD. It is shareware. The author keeps the copyright over
the whole package.

The public version of DFA (without the keyfile!) is freely
(re)distributable, but noone is allowed to sell the program for more
money than to cover just the costs of copying.

In any case noone may charge more than Fred Fish claims for one of his
"Library Disks"!

Subject: Beginner's Guide to Amiga E


TITLE

     Beginner's Guide to Amiga E

VERSION

     Edition 1.0.  Covers the latest (PD) version 2.1b of Amiga E.

AUTHOR

     Jason R. Hulance <jason@fsel.com> (or <m88jrh@ecs.ox.ac.uk>).

DESCRIPTION

     This Guide is intended to be complementary to the existing Amiga
     E documentation, and it is aimed at the beginner, rather than the
     more experienced programmer.  Amiga E is (currently) an Amiga
     specific programmming language, designed and implemented by
     Wouter van Oortmerssen.  It has become quite popular due to,
     amongst other things, its amazingly fast compilation speed and
     its similarity to C and Modula-2.

     The Guide is divided into three main parts: the first assumes
     very little knowledge of programming and progresses through the
     second to describe all aspects of the Amiga E language.  The
     third part is dedicated to some illustrative examples.
     Experienced programmers (who are new to Amiga E) may find the
     second part useful for learning the language, especially if read
     in conjunction with Wouter's documentation.

     The topics covered in Part One include procedures, variables and
     expressions.  Part Two builds on this, describing the type system
     (including the list and string types), quoted expressions,
     built-in functions, modules, exceptions and recursion.

     The Guide may also be used as a quick reference, since it
     includes both a language and a concept index.  The concept index
     is pretty exhaustive.  The language index covers all the language
     keywords and built-in functions, constants and variables.

     There are two forms of the Guide included in the archive: an
     AmigaGuide(R), hypertext version and an ANSI text version.  (The
     latter is the more suitable for printing, using standard Amiga
     printer drivers.)  Other forms are available (such as a more
     AmigaGuide-v34 friendly version) from the author (see below).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     To get the most from this you need the Amiga E package,
     obviously.  The current version is v2.1b and is Public Domain.
     You can find it in, for instance, the dev/e directory on any
     Aminet site.  If you don't already have a copy, try it: you might
     be very surprised.

     There is a text version of the Guide in the archive, so you don't
     need to use a hypertext viewer, but it is preferable.

HOST NAME

     Aminet.  For example, ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1) in the UK.

DIRECTORY

     /pub/aminet/dev/e

FILE NAMES

     BeginnersGuide.lzh (200Kbytes)

PRICE

     Free.  A more AmigaGuide-v34 friendly version is also available,
     but separately from the author (to keep the archive size down).
     Also, a TeX dvi and a PostScript version are available for a
     small cost (five UK pounds).  They don't contain anything more,
     but are much nicer for printing (the cross references and
     indexes, especially).

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     The archive is freely distributable so long as it is complete and
     unaltered.  All versions of the Guide are Copyright (c) 1994,
     Jason R. Hulance.

OTHER

     Amiga E v3.0 is due out sometime soon.  Wouter has been doing a
     grand job extending and improving the language.  There are a lot
     of really exciting new features.  This Guide will hopefully be
     completely revised to cover the new version.  You, the reader,
     are strongly encouraged to help me improve it by sending me your
     criticisms.

DESCRIPTION

     The Environment Adaptive Graphic User Interface (EAGUI) is a system
     which allows you to build interfaces that, as the name suggests, adapt
     to the environment they're run in. It uses normal GadTools and BOOPSI
     gadgets, and does not modify them in any way. This allows programmers to
     implement EAGUI in existing applications easily.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     EAGUI needs at least Release 2 of the AmigaOS, and is Release 3 aware.

DESCRIPTION

     The editor.gadget is a BOOPSI gadget for text entry,
     supporting multiple lines, borders, two cursor types,
     an optional notepad look, font setting, style setting,
     and much more.

     A programmer who is familiar with BOOPSI can use this
     gadget by simply creating an instance and then adding
     the gadget instance to a window's gadget list.  All
     text editing is then handled by the gadget.  When the
     programmer needs the text in the gadget, he/she can just
     read the text in.  When the gadget is no longer needed
     it can be deleted.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     The gadget requires OS 2.04 and up.  From the user's
     standpoint, for OS 2.04 and 2.1 the gadget must
     be placed in a drawer where the application that uses
     it exists, and for OS 3.0 and up the gadget can be
     installed in SYS:Classes/Gadgets.

HOST NAME

     It is available on Aminet.  Aminet's main site is
     ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).

DIRECTORY

     /pub/aminet/dev/gui

FILE NAME

     editorgadget.lha

PRICE

     I do not require a fee to be paid by end users of the
     gadget, but the programs that use the gadget may require
     paying a fee of some sort, which should be directed to
     the author of that software, not me.

     The cost for using this gadget in a program is that I
     get a copy of the software package it is used in, at no
     cost to me.  The purpose of this requirement is that
     I will be able to evaluate future needs of the gadget.
     Also, there should be mention of the gadget and author
     in the programs and documentation of the programs that
     use the gadget.  In programs you can drop a short line
     in the About requester: editor.gadget by Mark Thomas.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     The archive may be distributed only in its entirety to
     anywhere, such as ftp sites, a BBS, or a disk collection
     such as Fish disks.

     The editor.gadget file itself, and portions of the
     documentation pertaining to editor keyboard sequences
     can be distributed with software packages that use the
     gadget.

     In light of the fact that I give people the right to
     copy the archive and certain files, I can't actually
     retain a "copy" right, so therefore I am retaining the
     maintenance right (not recognized by law I'm sure).
     This right gives me the exclusive ability to make
     modifications to the files in the archive.

OTHER

     Please send any bug reports or suggestions to me.  There
     is a fully working example program that uses the gadget
     in the archive.

     11-May-94

AUTHORS

     Leon Woestenberg (leon@stack.urc.tue.nl)
     Jeroen Steenblik (jeroens@stack.urc.tue.nl)

DESCRIPTION

     The InfraRexx software along with the InfraJoy hardware serve as an
     ARexx-to-infrared interface, that adds the function of an infrared
     remote controller to your Amiga, and more.

     With this software and hardware you can:

       o Control external audio/video devices via ARexx commands.
       o Control Amiga programs via a common remote control unit.
       o Learn and edit new remote control infrared commands.

     For example you can control a moduleplayer via your compact
     disc player remote control unit. Or, control your video tape
     recorder via a graphic user interface.

     The main features are:

       o Seperate editor (with learner) and ARexx host commodity.
       o Multitasking-friendly infrared sampling monitor, with very
         low system overhead during monitoring, can also be disabled.
       o Font-sensitive, style-compliant graphic user interface.
       o Localization for Workbench 2.1+ users, and newlook menus for
         Kickstart 3.0+ users.
       o Lowcost hardware for joystickport, with optional throughput.
       o Uses the Amiga Installer Utility to install onto (hard)disk.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

       InfraRexx needs at least AmigaOS version 2.0, and the commodity
       needs ARexx Master to be running in order to be useful. The
       software is useless without the small InfraJoy hardware add-on,
       off which the design and full building instructions are included.
       The hardware can also be ordered by one of the authors.

TITLE

  MidiPlay

VERSION

  Version 2.11 (24.4.1994)

AUTHOR

  Janne Syv{niemi
  E-mail: csjasy@uta.fi

DESCRIPTION

  MidiPlay is a program for playing format 0 and 1 MIDI files. The way
  MIDI files are played can be changed using command line options, a
  configuration file or tool types in the program icon. Every file can
  have its own tool types which override starting configuration.

  The most useful options include: transposing, channel muting,
  tempo setting and external/internal synchronization. Different MIDI
  events can also be printed. All major features can be controlled via
  GUI and MIDI files can be loaded using a file requester. The playlist
  feature allows you to play MIDI files from a pre-defined list.

  It is also possible to play GM standard MIDI files with a non-GM
  synth using mapping feature. Every program change message can be
  mapped to any other PC message. Note on/off messages on the drum
  channel can also be mapped to any other note on/off message.

  For more advanced users there are options like merge and melody.
  Merge option connects MIDI IN and MIDI OUT and using this feature
  you can combine your playing with playing of MidiPlay. Melody channel
  is useful for those who want to sing along with music with the
  possibility to mute/unmute melody.

NEW FEATURES

  Major change since 2.0 is that the player part runs now as a
  separate task. Printing events and holding right mouse button down
  while playing won't disturb playing any more.

  One nasty bug which caused MidiPlay to crash when trying to print
  data event on some machines has been removed.

  Playlist idea has been slightly changed. Now all loaded files are
  added to the playlist. It is also possible to load many files at the
  same time. With the minibuffer feature you can make a selection from a
  long playlist and let MidiPlay play those files in the given order.

  New options since 2.00 include:
  o SOFT (only note on/off messages are ignored on muted channels)
  o NOMAPCHANNELS (no mapping on defined channels)
  o SKIP (eventless parts longer than defined with SKIP are skipped)
  o NODRUMPC (program change messages are ignored on the drum channel)
  o COUNT (MIDI file length in measures and duration are counted)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  If you want to play MIDI files and really hear them, your Amiga
  should be connected to a synth via MIDI interface. No special memory
  requirements. Fast RAM is recommended for smoother playing.

  MidiPlay should work on any Amiga with OS 2.04 or greater. MidiPlay
  requires the following disk resident libraries (both included):
  midi.library and reqtools.library

  SPEAK and NOMON options require Upd and Arexx. Upd v1.30 can be found
  on Aminet (directory util/rexx).

  A guide reader (like AmigaGuide) is needed to read the documentation
  and a lha archiver to unarchive the program package.

HOST NAME

  MidiPlay can be found on Aminet, e.g. via anonymous FTP server
  like ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4) or ftp.luth.se (130.240.18.2).

PRICE

  MidiPlay is free. People who use MidiPlay much should think about
  rewarding the author with a music related gift.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

  MidiPlay is copyright 1993, 1994 Janne Syv{niemi. All Rights
  Reserved. The program is GIFTWARE. It is freely distributable as
  long as all files are included in their original form and no extra
  fee is charged. Midiplay may not be included in any commercial
  package without a permission of the author.

     With this you can change directory by only writing
     enough of the directory name to identify it. The
     directory can be anywhere on the harddisk. If more

TITLE

     SpiroDraw04  - Spirograph(tm?) simulator of the spiral-drawing toy.
                    Simple, fun and addictive!

VERSION

     This is version 04.  Fixes an ugly GADGET message bug and a couple
     obscure bugs.  Also improved usability of Random and Previous data
     functions in the program.

COMPANY

     No company, just an AMINET upload by "yours truly".

AUTHOR

     SpiroDraw04 was written by me, Chuck Kenney.  My particulars
     (address, etc.) are included in the user document in the archive.

DESCRIPTION

     SpiroDraw04 simulates the Wheels-and-Rings-and-Pens spirograph
     drawing toy.  Allows the user to specify different parameters for
     the "Drawing Wheels, Drawing Rings", etc.  The use of a computer
     to generate the SpiroDraw designs actually enhances some of the
     capabilities!  SpiroDraw04 is mouse-driven (MENUs, GADGETs, etc.)
     and provides an easy way to create one's own 'eye-candy'.  It is
     fun _and_ addictive!  SpiroDraw04.lha also contains a very nice
     freely distributable "screen-to-IFF" saver utility written by
     Preben Nielsen (thanks, Preben) so that SpiroDraw designs can be
     imported into "paint" programs.  SpiroDraw04 is shareware but does
     not nag the user in any way and all features are fully functional.

NEW FEATURES

     The user now has the ability in SpiroDraw04 to interrupt a
     SpiroDraw design-in-progress with a Left Mouse Button click.

     Moved the "Random" and "Last" (previous) data functions from
     MENUs to the "Set Data..." user-input window so the user could
     get immediate viual feedback on the "new" parameters that are
     set by these two functions.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     There are no special requirements that I know of.
     SpiroDraw03 has been tested on an A2000HD (OS 2.1)
     and an A1000 (OS 1.3).

HOST NAME

     SpiroDraw04.lha has just been uploaded to the AMINET site,
     ftp.etsu.edu (192.43.199.20) and should soon be available on
     all AMINET mirrors.

DIRECTORY

     aminet/gfx/misc/SpiroDraw04.lha

FILE NAMES

     SpiroDraw04.lha is 57,195 bytes long.

PRICE

     The asking shareware price is the amount sent to me by my first
     sharware contributor (Thanks go to Bill from Glendale, AZ!).
     This requested shareware fee is $5.00 (US).  

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     This program is freely distributable but is a copyrighted (1994)
     shareware program by me, Chuck Kenney.

OTHER

     SpiroDraw04, and other programs in progress are coming out of my
     basement as a result of the availability of a truly wonderful
     "BASIC-but-much-more!" compiler, "ACE" by David Benn.  I would
     like to sincerely thank Mr. Benn for renewing my enthusiasm in
     programming and for making it possible for me to make my programs
     available to more than just my friends and immediately family!

    o Supports new 3.0 features (newlook menus, memory pools,
      interleaved screens, 24 bit palette,....)
    o Copyback and write-through file buffering system.
    o Powerful purging system with Global settings for days
      and/or number of messages to keep. Each conference can
      also have separate settings.
    o Everything can be controlled from the keyboard.
    o All events (orders) can be edited freely after having been
      entered.

Subject: WinkBug hardware debugging aid


TITLE

     WinkBug

DESCRIPTION

   "Debugging Code was Never Easier"

   WinkBug(tm) consists of a small 2-line by 16-character LCD display that
   can help you to debug programs more rapidly and to be more productive.
   It comes installed in a 3-position parallel port switchbox for added
   convenience.  All 25 positions are switched.

   As you may be aware, certain types of programs do not lend themselves
   very well to the use of a debugger.  The program may be automatically
   loaded by the operating system, and not give you any way to "attach"
   the debugger.  Even if this is not a concern, the debugging software
   itself may change the environment enough so that the program no longer
   behaves in quite the same way as when the debugger isn't present.

   WinkBug will solve these problems by virtue of being almost
   "invisible" to both the OS and the program being tested.  Your program
   may write debugging messages to the WinkBug display by means of
   software contained in the wink.library.  There is even a built-in
   beeper that responds to the ASCII BEL character.  The display speed is
   fast enough for all but the most time critical code:  40us/char.  The
   code in wink.library is very tight as well.

   WinkBug will be useful in debugging device drivers, libraries,
   handlers, interrupt service routines, and many more difficult pieces
   of code.  Utilities are provided so that you may redirect Software
   Alerts to WinkBug or watch task-switching in real time (only 7%
   overhead).  Enforcer support is also provided.

   Although there are debugging applications where a full ANSI terminal
   is indispensable, you will find that for many uses, WinkBug will
   function just as well, with the additional benefits of taking up
   almost no space and drawing a negligible 10mw of power.

   Even if a full ANSI terminal is available where you normally work, you
   will find WinkBug indispensable for debugging code in the field.  It
   is even possible to build hooks for WinkBug display routines into
   your code, along with special access codes.  You could then send the
   WinkBug hardware to a customer a continent away for remote debugging.
   Imagine the possibilities!

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     WinkBug is plug compatible with all models of Amiga computers except
     the A1000.  No external power needed.

PRICE

     US$54 + shipping.
     Shipping is $5 in the U.S. and Canada.  Others please call.

     * Black border for screens (available only in 3.0+).
     * New layout of the GUI.
     * Palette title localized.
     * Screen patterns now use screens default titles instead of 
       current screen title. It makes easier writing patterns for 
       screens such as workbench or BrowserII ones.

     * New way to automatically define a hotkey by hitting it.
     * Now Yak can open only one palette per screen.
     * Added danish catalog, installation script and doc.
     * Added a toggle to blank mouse or not on key pressed.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     OS release 2.04 or newer is required; Yak has been tested with
     OS releases through 3.0.

    Kickstart 3.0 (V39.106) and Workbench 3.0 (V39.48)


INSTALLATION

    Installation is very simple.  Copy the A64 Package software from the
supplied disks to your hard drive. 

    A script file is included to copy fonts to your FONTS directory and
a library to your LIBS directory.


REVIEW

    The A64 Package is a hardware and software product.  The hardware
consists of a small box which has a male DB25 and 8 pin DIN connectors along
with some special circuitry.  This box connects to your parallel port and
allows you to connect Commodore 8-bit serial peripherals such as the 15XX
series disk drives and printers.  NEVER PLUG THE INTERFACE INTO YOUR AMIGA
WHILE THE AMIGA IS TURNED ON.  You could damage your Amiga and peripherals
by doing so.  If you have an Amiga 1000 you will require an additional cable
specifically made to connect A500/2000 devices to an A1000 parallel port.
The hardware interface can stay plugged in at all times without interfering
with any programs on your Amiga as long as they do not use the parallel
port.  If you want to use your parallel port with some other pieces of
hardware like a printer or digitizer, you must either remove the hardware
interface and install the other device or use an A-B switch box (Centronics
parallel with female connectors).

    The software is a collection of Amiga programs which lets you access
and run C64 software. The main program, A64, is the Commodore 64 emulator.
The other programs allow you to transfer files between the C64 and Amiga
disks (with 15XX disk drives).

    After you install The A64 Package and run the A64 program, you will
notice that the BASIC startup screen is different from that of a real C64.
This is because the Commodore 64 ROMs (two computer chips located inside a
real C64 which contain the operating system) are not present in A64.  The C64
ROMs are not included because they are copyrighted by Commodore. The A64
contains a complete C64 ROM emulation which allows A64 to run most C64
programs. A64 ROM emulation is very compatible with the C64 ROMs, but there
may be some C64 programs that will not run because of the lack of real C64
ROMs. The A64 Package utilities includes a C64 BASIC program which can be
transferred to a real C64 via a 15XX disk drive connected to the A64
hardware interface. This program when run on the C64 will dump the C64 ROMs
to a file which can then be transferred back to the Amiga and used in the
A64 emulation.

    A64 is a complete Commodore 64 emulator. Sound, graphics, BASIC and
machine language are all emulated. A64 fully integrates with the Amiga by
allowing you to use Amiga disk drives, hard drives, ram drives, printers and
modems.

    A64 operates in two modes:  Pause Mode and C64 Mode.  When in Pause
Mode, you have access to the A64 Prefs (preferences) and A64Mon (machine
language monitor). The current C64 program that A64 is running will be
paused. Pause Mode gives you complete access to the Amiga system, and
multitasking is completely functional. The C64 Mode runs the C64 program. In
C64 mode you do not have access to the Amiga system.  Multitasking is not
disabled, but A64 controls a majority of the Amiga system.  To enter Pause
mode from C64 Mode, press the two ALT keys simultaneously.

    A64 emulation speed will depend on the program you are running and
the type of microprocessor that your Amiga uses. On 68000 based Amigas, A64
is not capable of running all programs at usable speed. Accelerated Amigas
can see emulation speeds over 300%.  Most games will not run over 100% no
matter how fast your Amiga is.

    I've done most of my evaluation of A64 with public domain software.
I have been able to run everything I can throw at it. I do enjoy browsing
the ABCUG user group monthly C64 public domain program disk.

    A great deal of effort was spent trying to make the A64 as
compatible as possible. The biggest problem with compatibility is related to
disk I/O and custom disk drive routines. Custom disk drive routines "Fast
Loaders" are extremely time critical and must run at exactly 100% speed in
order to function properly. "Fast Loaders" vary from program to program. The
only way to emulate "Fast Loaders" is to write a custom loader for each
program which is impossible since there are hundreds of variations. A64 V3.0
supports some "Fast Loaders" using Patch Files. There are Patch Files for
ISEPICed archived programs, SID/PIC V3.4, SIDPlayer, and GEOS.  (GEOS is
supported only on 68000 Amigas and 1541/1571 disk drives because of the
time-critical nature of the GEOS operating system.)

    One method of speeding up A64 emulation is to convert the C64
program from 6510 opcodes to 68000 opcodes. This has the potential to double
your emulation speed. This is accomplished with a utility called "CONVERT".
The CONVERT utility converts C64 machine language into Amiga machine
language. This conversion process eliminates a lot of work the A64 has do
while running the emulation.

    A64Tools is the file transfer and file conversion utility. It allows
you to copy, convert and print files using any combination of Amiga and C64
disk drives and printers. Text files can easily be converted between
PetASCII and ASCII. Amiga drives only support PRG and SEQ files under A64
emulation. ":" and "/" are illegal characters for Amiga filenames. When
A64Tools encounters on of these characters in a filename, the character will
automatically be changed to a "-".

    As an original A64 V2.0 registered user, I am impressed with the
enhanced SID chip support, increased speed and compatibility. I also welcome
the addition of Patch Files for "Fast Loader" support along with support for
GEOS. It was worth the $25 upgrade fee.


DOCUMENTATION

    Documentations consists of a professionally printed softbound
manual. It has an extensive index and table of contents.  The manual assumes
that you are familiar with the basic operation of the Amiga and the terms
used to describe it. The manual also assumes you are familiar with the basic
use of the Commodore 64.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

    I like the professionally bound manual. 
    I like the patch file support.
    I like the improved SID support.

    I dislike the software not working in native AGA graphic mode.

    I would like to see 1581 emulation using native Amiga disk drives.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    This product has evolved over several years. I was first introduced
to this product as the GO-64.


BUGS

    None at this time.


VENDOR SUPPORT

    I have not tried contacting the vendor.


WARRANTY

    90 day limited warranty.


CONCLUSIONS

    I enjoy the ability to emulate other computers. As Newsletter Editor
the ABCUG user group which supports the Amiga and Commodore 64/128 computer
users, I find A64 a valuable tool for reviewing C64 public domain software
and writing tutorials for the monthly newsletter. Understanding the
limitations of software emulation, I give this product **** (4 out of 5
stars).

PRODUCT NAME

    Another World


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

    Another World is a game set in (logically enough) another world.  The
idea is to get out alive and back to Earth.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

LIST PRICE

SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

    HARDWARE

        The box just says it's compatible with the Amiga 500, 500+,
        600, 1500, and 2000.

        However, as it's compatible with the A600, it should work on
        an A1200.

        It should work with accelerators, although the game may go
        too fast.

    SOFTWARE

        None given.


COPY PROTECTION

    The game comes on two disks.  The disks are themselves un-protected
and thus are copyable.  However, every time you play the game you do have to
enter in a code (from the supplied code wheel).  Once slight error and you
have to re-load the game.


REVIEW

    Once you are past the protection system (see above), you are shown a
very well animated introduction.  Once you've seen it a few times, you may
want to skip it.  Unfortunately, for some reason this is not possible, and
so you have to sit and watch it.  However, once past the intro, the main
game is only a short load and a disk swap away.

    The object of the game is to get to the next level intact, while
solving some devilish puzzles along the way.

    The first level sees you materialising in some water, where you must
swim to the surface before you become octopus food.  On this first level,
the quality of the graphics will get you and you'll decide whether you will
like the game or not.

    Although the puzzles are not particularly hard, you may feel that
dying for the umpteenth time at the hands of some killer worms is getting to
be rather annoying.  However, come what may, you should continue just to get
the code word for the next level.

    As I said previously, the graphics and animation are very well done,
and in the case of the animation, it is very smooth.  However, it's the main
sprite (your character) that lets things down - at times it appears that
he's skating instead of walking, and often you find that the collision
detection, is at times poor, although it does work in your favour.

    Overall, it's a excellent game graphically, and has very good
gameplay, although it can be quite hard at times.  It is well worth buying,
especially at budget prices.

ABOUT THE REVIEW

    First, in the GENERAL OVERVIEW section, I explain the X window
system.  After that, I review the product and say how well it works on the
Amiga.

    I will not explain how to connect the Amiga to a remote machine and
how to set up the entire system, as this is beyond the scope of the review.


GENERAL OVERVIEW

    I apologize in advance, but I have to use some vocabulary which may
be unknown to the average reader but is often used in the environment where
X is common.  Of course, I will try to explain any unfamiliar terms.

    The X window system is a hardware-independent windowing system with
network support.  It is available for almost every computer platform.  There
are two main parts of the system: the server and the clients.  The server is
a program that runs all the time and allows clients to display their
output.  Users do not interact with the server directly.  Clients are
application programs which use the X window system as their display and tell
the server what to do: open windows, draw lines and points, fill areas of
the display with patterns, etc.  You can think of the X server as similar to
the Amiga's underlying "Intuition" software.

    If the Amiga already has a window system, what is the purpose of
running X?  The answer is that X works transparently over a network, runs on
many different machines, and there are hundreds of X clients available as
freeware.

    The X server is the only part of the entire system which is hardware
dependent.  That is, it must be written to support the particular hardware
(Amiga, SPARCstation, 80406 machine, etc.) and graphics devices (ECS and AGA
chipsets, special graphics boards, etc.) on which it is running.  Once the
server is written or ported, client programs can be run.  The server needs
to understand the X protocol which is required for the clients to tell the
server what to do.  This protocol is able to run over a network such as a
TCP/IP driven direct network.

    Clients are usually application programs; for example, the terminal
program "xterm", the paint program "xfig", the clock "xclock", and the editor
"xedit".  Clients may be run locally on the same machine, or remotely over a
network.  That is, on your computer screen, you may have client programs
that are physically running on the same computer or multiple computers.  In
short, it is not important whether the clients run on a remote machine or on
the local machine:  the output can be displayed anywhere on the network
using the X protocol.  Here is a diagram illustrating what I have discussed
so far:

          Server           Connections     Clients
        ____________        ___     _
       |            |      |   |   | |

       | on graphics|      | o |   |t|     |______|
       |            |      | r |   |o|      ______
       |     device |      | k |   |.|     | Xterm|
       |____________|      |___|   |_|     |______|

            ^
            |
        ____________
       | Keyboard   |
       | Mouse      |
       |____________|


    One very important client is the Window Manager.  This client allows
the user to drag windows, define and display menus, move icons, etc.  There
are a dozen different window managers available.  Simple ones just add
window borders to any window, and more complex ones even offer you virtual
desktop spaces (similar to auto-scrolling on the Workbench) or 3D imagery.

    Hence, the X window system is a true Retargetable Graphics (RTG)
System.  Everything can be retargeted, even the keyboard and mouse inputs
(which are part of the hardware dependent X server).  So even the Amiga
could be used as an X terminal once an X server is made available.  DaggeX
serves this purpose.

    DaggeX is able to connect via TCP/IP with other machines and can
display the output of locally or remotely started programs.



INSTALLATION

    DaggeX installs very easily:  just extract the archive anywhere on
your hard drive and copy the required ixemul.library to the LIBS: directory.
The small Installation Guide covers the basic installation, nothing more.
The authors obviously believe that anyone really interested into using X is
also able to configure and maintain his/her system.

    Most X clients need fonts to display text.  If you intend to start
some clients on your Amiga (for local or remote use), you need to install
the supplied X fonts too.

    After setting up the system using some ASSIGN and PATH commands, you
may want to start the server with the supplied 'startx' script.  This script
starts the X server and also the supplied window manager, 'fvwm'.  This is a
modern and highly configurable window manager that enables you to have menus
on your system and drag windows around.

    It makes sense to start the window manager on your local machine,
because then dragging and dropping of windows is faster when no network is
involved.  This does not matter that much on a fast, Ethernet-based network,
but on a modem-driven PPP connection, it makes a big difference.

    DaggeX opens a screen-mode requester and asks you to choose a mode
for the X screen.  It also offers you the choice to run in monochrome or up
to 256 colors (on AGA).

    Now the X server runs, and the typical X mouse pointer is
displayed.  You are looking at an empty screen now, which is quite boring.
But this is normal since you have not run any clients yet.  The startx
script starts the fvwm window manager, which has a fancy 3D look and offers
vast configurability for starting clients and more.

    Now it's time to start other interesting clients.  Currently
available to run locally on the Amiga 'xv', the best image viewer for X;
'xfig', a very nice vector driven paint program; 'xedit', a simple text
editor; 'xauth' and 'xhost', some tools for network support which give
permission for remote clients to open windows on your machine.

    To run clients, you must switch back to your Workbench screen with
left-Amiga N (or click the hidden depth-gadget on the X server screen) and
then start a client in a shell.

    For the very first test, I tried 'xv'.  It pops up and offers you a
menu driven, almost Mac-like GUI and asks you for an image to load.  I chose
a nice image and voila, it was displayed.  Really, I am astonished to see
how well it works.  But I am a bit disappointed about the size of the screen.
At my university, I work almost every day on a 1280x1024 or 1152x900 screen
with 256 colors, and here I have but an NTSC:Hires Interlace screen at
720x470 in 4 colors.

    So what: DaggeX supports my Picasso II graphics board!  I restarted
the X server using the Picasso options and opened a nice 1152x900 screen
with 256 colors, too.  Now this is hype, but this is simply a great feeling!
xv is fun!  Forget about Adpro and ImageFX:  just use xv and DaggeX. :-)

    At this point, the only thing which is annoying is that I wasn't able
to make the X server run on a Picasso screen using the normal ASL-screen mode
requester - it just hung.  I had to use the special option '-village' to
start it on the Picasso.

    Now you might ask me about the performance.  For a 68030 based
machine, this is very fast.  I won't post the 'xbench' or 'xperf' benchmark
results here because they didn't run on my local machine but on the remote
machine.  Hence, only the X server and my network were really busy, not the
entire machine - it would yield into non-competitive results.  If anyone is
really interested, one might want to compile the benchmark programs.  I
didn't have the time.

    Now, I was interested how well DaggeX works in a network.  On an
Amiga Meeting held early this year, i had the opportunity to test DaggeX
against a 80486-based machine running Linux.  All what was needed was to set
up a telnet session, start the xauthentication on the local machine, and then
start a remote client.  For a start, I tried the terminal program xterm,
which gives me a VT100-compatible console on the remote machine and enables
me to start more clients without the basic telnet session.

    All worked flawlessly and was very fluid over the Ethernet
connection.  I was really happy.  Even heavy programs such as "xspringies" or
games like "xpilot" worked really well and were stable, even though they
stress the server with many commands to draw lines, circles and more.

    Another test was to start some clients on a NetBSD driven Amiga on
the same network, also using Ethernet.  Even there, I had no problems, though
the speed of the programs was of course slower.

    The only missing point was that I was unable to set up an xdm
connection.  Xdm offers you a login prompt over the network and enables you
to run a fully qualified console on the remote machine without connecting
with a telnet on the AmigaDOS side.  This is the way professional X
terminals do it. For this purpose, the X server needs to support the
'-broadcast' or '-query' option, which was not implemented when I tested
DaggeX.  This is a weak spot in DaggeX, but the authors hoped to implement
this function very soon.  It would sure help to set up remote connections.

    The last test was a bit expensive for me, but I did it nonetheless.
I connected DaggeX via modem and PPP to my university and started some
clients on a Sparc 10 running Solaris.  The modem was running at 14,400 bps
and thus offers about 1 KB/sec transfer rates.  It worked really nicely and
without any problems once the basic network configuration was done.  It is
silly to view images with xv over a modem network, as the entire image needs
to be transferred over the modem.  Thus I started only simple clients such
as a newsreader or a clock.  They worked fine.

        During the test, I got several Enforcer hits (illegal memory
accesses), especially when I killed a client via the window manager, rather
than using the program's quit command.  I would guess this indicates a bug
somewhere in the network routines.

    I can't blame the authors for those Enforcer hits, as all they did
was porting a typical Unix program to the Amiga.  A typical Unix program
almost never sets variables to a default value or almost always 'forgets' to
free allocated memory, as Unix will do that for you.  And reading from
non-initialized variables yields Enforcer hits on AmigaDOS.

    I had several crashes where I could not identify the cause, but all
overall I had expected by far more crashes than those I actually had.  Why?
Because X is a resource eater, and on small machines like the Amiga, it will
run into memory limits quite fast.

    I found that 4MB of RAM are constantly needed and allocated while
running DaggeX.  With my 8MB, I was barely able to run the window manager,
start xv locally, and look at some pictures without running out of memory.
And still I can't blame the DaggeX authors. :-)

    Testing the X11R5 feature of font servers failed due to missing font
servers on my test platforms (on the Sparc offered, but that was running
over the modem where I didn't wanted to start a cached font server).


DOCUMENTATION

    Supplied documentation is poor and describes only the basic
installation and how to enable remote clients to display their output on
your X server.

    Running the X server requires basic knowledge of the X window
system and TCP/IP networks.


LIKES

    Personally, I was impressed by the speed and the flawless work of
DaggeX.  It enables me to run X on my beloved system without any Unix
environment actually needed on my Amiga.

    DaggeX gives you the big chance to run X on your Amiga and at the
same time start local AmigaDOS applications without any problems.  This makes
the Amiga worth running in professional environments where Unix workstations
are common and the Amiga is used only for simple renderings or simple text
application use.

    I like the fact that you are able to run true X clients on your
local Amiga, compiling them with GCC and the supplied X libraries.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

    I don't like the way it currently connects with remote systems, but
that's a question of style.  I prefer the 'broadcast' or 'query' style for
connecting.  The 'xauth' way done by the authors is less complicated for the
programmers, but yields into major headaches for non-experienced users.

    Wishes for future versions:  I would like to see the above mentioned
options not only made available but actually run, too. :)

    Another wish or idea is that the X server might be able to display
AmigaDOS (Intuition) applications concurrently on the same screen - even on
the high resolution and non-Intuition Picasso screen.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    The only other X server available for Amiga is the commercial product
from GfxBase.  Dale Luck and his crew have marketed this X server for quite a
while now and offer professional support, too.  Also, they support (to my
knowledge) more graphics boards and offer more basic clients.  Their server
does support the missing features of DaggeX:  query, broadcast, and xdm on
the network.

    The GfxBase X server is very stable and is highly optimized for the
Amiga in both speed and memory use.  It does not offer a nice screenmode
requester at the beginning and currently runs only with the AS225R1 and
AS225R2 TCP/P stack, which is either no longer sold or was not made
available yet.  I don't know if GfxBase intends to support AmiTCP.  But this
does not really matter as there is a freeware socket library available which
emulates the socket library of AS225R2 for AmiTCP.  I may add that my
experience with GfxBase X server is a bit old, so they might have changed it
heavily.

    I think it does not make sense to compare DaggeX with X servers
running on Unix machines, because the entire environment is totally
different.  The X servers completely fit into a Unix system due to the fact
that TCP/IP comes standard with Unix.


BUGS

    I wasn't really able to find major bugs besides some unexplained
crashes and Enforcer hits.  DaggeX is still under development, and most of
the bugs are a heritage of the basic X server which was never intended to run
outside of a Unix system.


WARRANTY

    None.  DaggeX has no warranty other than that the authors believes
it might help you.


CONCLUSIONS

    DaggeX provides a nice opportunity to run the X window system on your
Amiga.  It is sure helpful in a Unix environment or networks.

    Professional users might want to have a look at DaggeX due to the
Picasso II support, but will probably consider the GfxBase X server for its
better support and documentation.

    On a scale of 0 to 5 stars, I give DaggeX 3.75 stars.  This could be
increased to 4.25 stars when the missing features are added and better
documentation is available.

        No CPU restrictions.

    SOFTWARE

        Requires AmigaDOS 1.3 or better.
        Works fine under AmigaDOS version 2 and 3.
        A few features require AmigaDOS 2.0 or better.


COPY PROTECTION

    None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    Model:             Amiga 2000HD
    Processors:        25 MHz 68030 CPU, 68882 FPU
    Chipset:           PAL ECS
    RAM:               5 MB (1 MB Chip, 4 MB Fast)
    Hard drive:        Quantum 50 MB internal SCSI
    Floppy drive:      One internal 880K
    Monitor:           Commodore 1084S
    Operating system:  3.0 Beta (Kickstart 39.106, Workbench 39.29)


INSTALLATION

    DICE 3.0 comes on five disks.  Installation is done by the Commodore
Installer program.  There are three Installer scripts with icons on Disk 1 of
the distribution.  One installs DICE on your hard drive, a second installs
it on floppy disks, and the third creates the freeware version (see below).

    The hard drive installation works perfectly.  It offers an
assortment of options -- whether to install the 1.3, 2.0, and/or 3.0 header
files and link libraries; whether to include all, none, or a selected subset
of the examples; which editor to install; and so on.  Anything not selected
in the initial installation can be added later; an option in the Installer
script allows the addition of selected modules to an existing installation.

    Unlike some badly-written installers, DICE's installation process
is very careful never to change or replace any existing files without
explaining exactly what it's going to do and waiting for permission.

    Depending on which options you select, DICE can take up anywhere
from 1.5 to 8 megabytes of hard drive space.  Mine took up 4.7 megs, which
is probably a fairly typical amount; few users are likely to need the full 8
megs (which assumes, for example, that you install all three complete sets of
includes and libraries).  Incidentally, although the installer and the
manual refer to "3.0", the include files actually supplied are version 3.1.

    The freeware DICE is a freely distributable version of the compiler
with floating point support and some Amiga-specific features disabled, but
otherwise a perfectly good C compiler.  Users are encouraged to distribute
the freeware version, which consists of the compiler, link libraries,
standard C include files, and the relevant documentation -- no editor or any
other tools (though DME can be found on a Fred Fish disk).

    The freeware version Installer script attempts to install DICE onto a
single floppy, which doesn't work -- it's about 1.3 megs and needs two (I
guess they must have tested it on an Amiga 4000 with high density 1.76 MB
drives and forgot that most Amigas only have 880K drives).  This is easy to
get around if you're running the installation on an Amiga with a hard drive:
just create a drawer on your hard drive and assign "Freeware_Dice:" to it
before you start.  (You'll still need a spare floppy for the install script
to format, though.)  Afterwards, you can split the installed files between
two floppies.  You can't run the freeware installation on a floppy-only
system.


COMPILER

    The actual compiler is changed little from the shareware version of
DICE, apart from a few enhancements (mostly related to the VMAKE interface
-- see below) and bug fixes.  Anyone familiar with the shareware DICE will
find no surprises here.

    The compiler was designed with quick and reliable code generation as
the primary goal, with optimisation secondary.  That's not to say DICE does
no optimisation; it doesn't do the kind of aggressive optimisation
performed by GCC or SAS C, but it produces perfectly good code for all but
the most demanding cases (where most programmers would probably switch to
assembly language anyway).

    The DICE compiler, DCC, is almost entirely conformant to the
ANSI/ISO C standard, which is only to be expected these days.  There are a
very few features and functions omitted, such as the atan2() function, and a
large number of enhancements.

    Compiler features include precompiled header files, automatic
generation of function prototypes, profiling (a special set of link
libraries that allow you to keep track of exactly how much run time each
part of your program is taking up), and a "typeof" operator.

    Most of the enhancements, of course, are related to writing
Amiga-specific code.  These include automatic opening and closing of shared
libraries; the "__chip" type qualifier to force data into Chip RAM; dynamic
stack checking (which automatically gives your program more stack space when
it runs short); the "wbmain()" function (giving a program different entry
points depending on whether it was started from the Shell or Workbench);
full control over parameter passing via registers or stack; and an extensive
set of functions that make giving your program an ARexx interface fairly
painless.

    The DICE package includes the complete set of include files and
link libraries for Workbench 1.3, 2.0, and 3.0/3.1.


INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

    The centrepiece of the whole system is VMAKE, which, as you might
expect from the name, is a visual "make" tool.  It's really an integrated
development environment.  You create a "Project" and tell VMAKE what source
files belong to it.  VMAKE gives you access to the editor of your choice (see
below), compiler, debugger, and help system.  Compiler options are selected
through VOPTS, which is basically a GUI for DCC -- you use the usual
Intuition tools (gadgets, list windows, and so on) to select the compiler
options, link libraries, and so on.  If you select a source file from VMAKE,
the editor is invoked.  Once you've written the source code and set the
compile options, you hit the "Make" button to compile and link everything
that needs it, then pick one of the "Run" options to test it (there are
three options -- CLI, Workbench, or Debugger).

    VMAKE knows what to do with individual source files by looking at
their names -- a name ending in ".c" is C code, ".a" is assembler source,
and so on.  It's smart enough to know not to compile a source file that
hasn't changed since the last compile.

    If you get compile errors, the editor is automatically brought up
with the cursor positioned on the line containing the first error; when
you've fixed that, you hit Shift-F5 (or whatever alternative key you want to
define) and the cursor is moved to the next error.  The full list of errors
is visible in another window.

    VMAKE is highly customisable.  All the gadget and menu details are
stored in plain text files rather than being hard-coded, and the formats are
fully documented.  You can rewrite, add, and subtract menus and gadgets to
your heart's content.

    I have a couple of nitpicks with VMAKE.  One concerns the "Save"
options on VMAKE and VOPTS.  Every time I make any changes and save them, I
get a requester that warns me that I'll be overwriting my existing project,
and do I really want to do that?  Well of course I do, that's why I chose
"Save".  I'm all for safety measures in important things, but VMAKE has far
too many "Are you sure?" requesters for my taste Surprisingly, given the
impressive configurability of VMAKE in most respects, there doesn't seem to
be any way to switch them off.

    My other complaint is that VOPTS causes an Enforcer hit every time
it's invoked!  (If you're not familiar with Enforcer, see below.) This is
inexcusable in commercial software.  It doesn't seem to cause any problems
(it appears to be a dereferenced null pointer), but it's not exactly the
most encouraging sign, especially since Enforcer is included in the DICE
package.

    A feature I like a lot is DiceHelp.  This is a program that takes
the name of a C function, type, or include file, looks it up in the
Autodocs, and opens a window to show you the documentation (if it finds
any).  DICE 3.0 comes with docs for the standard C and DICE-specific
functions; if you have the Commodore Autodocs it will use them too.  The
installation program automatically creates the necessary ARexx scripts to
integrate this with your choice of editor.  You just move the cursor over
the function name and hit F5; the editor opens a second window showing the
relevant documentation.


DEBUGGER

    DICE includes a source code debugger, DD.  It can be used either
standalone (from the command line) or through VMAKE.

    I'm not quite sure what to report about DD.  Most of it seems to
work; you can see the source code in a window, set breakpoints and so on,
but it seems to be missing one of the most important features of a
debugger:  I can't find any way to inspect (or set) the value of a
variable.  (You can read the values of memory locations, but since there's
no way of finding the address of a variable, that's not much help.) I say
"seems to" because I can't believe OIC could have left out anything so
important; but if it's there, it isn't documented, and I haven't been able
to figure it out by trial and error.  I'll reserve judgement on the debugger.


EDITORS

    The DICE package includes two editors.  DME is the standard editor
that has been included with all versions of DICE.  The new one is AME
(Advanced Micro Emacs).  I switched to AME immediately and haven't regretted
it; it's basically all the good features of Emacs without the megabloat
(less than 100K!).

    Many features are common to both editors:  multiple windows, full
ARexx support, programmable keys and menus, and all the usual features you'd
expect in an editor (search and replace, clipboard support, paragraph
formatting, and so on).  AME has a few features not found in DME:  multiple
undo steps (although this still has a few bugs in it); the ability to open
on its own screen or a public screen (DME opens only on the Workbench) and
even jump to a different screen while running; and 16-bit character support.

    AME also has a "C mode" which is automatically invoked when you edit
a file whose name ends in ".c".  You can also switch it on manually.  It
provides programmer-friendly features like bracket matching (warning you if
you enter a mismatched bracket).

    Besides its own two editors, DICE also supplies sets of ARexx macros
for integrating VMAKE with Cygnus Ed and TurboText and promises to provide
more editor options in the future.


OTHER TOOLS

    Besides the compiler, editors, debugger, and VMAKE, a large number
of other tools are supplied with DICE.

    RCS (Revision Control System) helps with the development of large
projects.  It keeps track of who is working on each source file, recording
all changes to allow later reversion to an old version if necessary.  I
don't use this myself (it seems like overkill for one-person projects), but
it would be extremely useful for large projects involving several
programmers and many source files.  (I program mainframes for a living, and
we use a similar system in our work.)  RCS is fully integrated with VMAKE.

    There is an assembler, DAS.  It's designed primarily to be called by
DCC as part of the compilation process, so its features are fairly minimal
and somewhat specialised, but it can be used as a standalone assembler if
you need one.  Again, VMAKE knows about it.

    Mike Sinz's Enforcer is included.  Enforcer is run in the background
(most programmers put it in their s:User-Startup and leave it running
permanently) and uses the MMU (Memory Management Unit) to watch for illegal
access to certain regions of memory, such as the low page and nonexistent
pages.  With the help of auxiliary tools like SegTracker and FindHit (both
included), you can often locate the exact line of code that produced such
errors -- the classic example is a dereferenced null pointer.  Enforcer
works only on an Amiga with an MMU, which basically means a 68030 (not
68EC030) or 68040 CPU.

    Other tools include DOBJ, a disassembler; DPROF, a profiler for use
with the profiling libraries; FDTOLIB, which creates link libraries from FD
files; and many others.

    Massive quantities of source code are provided.  The source for
VMAKE and many of the other tools is present.  There are also working
examples of a shared library, an Exec device, a DOS handler, and a printer
driver.


DOCUMENTATION

    DICE 3.0 comes with a printed manual of about 450 pages.  It's very
tightly bound and won't lie flat; in fact, it's difficult to even hold it
open with one hand.  I recommend that the first thing any purchaser does is
take the manual to the nearest printer and get it spiral bound (thanks to
Liam Greenwood for the suggestion).  It cost me NZ$4.00 (about US$2.50).  I
don't know why so many software publishers are unwilling to add the extra
dollar or so to the price in order to have spiral binding.

    The manual is well-organised and fairly well written and should be
equally useful to beginners and experts.  The proof-reading occasionally
leaves something to be desired, though.  There are a few humorous comments
of the "This page unintentionally left blank" variety.

    The manual begins with an outline of DICE's features and
instructions for installing it, which amount to little more than "Put Disk 1
in the drive and hit the Install icon".  This is followed by an introduction
to C, which is probably a waste of space -- it's far too sketchy for a
novice actually to learn C from it without a real textbook, and it is
redundant if you have a real textbook.

    Next comes the description of VMAKE.  This is thorough and easy to
follow, although the section on VOPTS is missing (the relevant page just
says "[TBA]", so I guess someone forgot to stick it in).  This isn't a
serious problem; if you read the section later in the manual that describes
the compiler's command line options, it's pretty obvious how they correspond
to the gadgets in VOPTS.

    The next sections cover the DICE compiler, the various tools and
utilities, the two editors, and the online help system.  Full documentation
for most of these is also provided on disk.

    The biggest section of the manual is the function reference, which
documents all of the standard C functions, as well as those specific to
DICE.  These are in the standard Autodocs format and are also provided on
disk for use with DiceHelp.

    The last section will be very helpful to those new to C
programming.  It's a problem-solving guide that describes many of the most
common errors made by C programmers and how to avoid them.

    There is a fairly thorough index.


LIKES

    Installation:  Painless and apparently flawless hard disk
installation.

    Compiler:  Very fast compilation; almost complete ANSI/ISO
standardisation; useful extensions, especially the ARexx package.

    Editors:  Ability to use several editors; extensive customisation
capability; multi-window and multi-screen capability in AME; ARexx interface.

    Development environment:  VMAKE gives access to everything you need
for development; Style Guide compliant interface; fully customisable and
extensible; excellent online help system.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

    Installation:  Freeware version installation doesn't work properly.

    Editors:  Buggy "undo" in AME; AME opens on the Workbench by default
when you invoke it from VMAKE, which is annoying.  It has always mystified me
why so many people write editors that insist on taking over the Workbench,
when opening their own screen is so easy.

    Development environment:  Major missing feature in debugger (this
is my only really serious complaint); Enforcer hit in VMAKE/VOPTS; annoying
"Are you sure?" requesters.

    Suggestions:  Apart from bug fixes, I'd like to see an "off" switch
for VMAKE's annoying requesters.  You can edit VMAKE's options to make AME
use its own screen, which I prefer, but it takes some digging in the
documentation to figure out how to do this; it should be easier (or, better
yet, the default).  A good, standalone assembler would be very useful.  The
manual says at one point that A68K is included, but it isn't; I guess it got
left out at the last moment.

    One major feature I'd like to see is some sort of interface
designer.  Most compilers on the PC and Mac come with GUI design toolkits;
we're always saying how marvellous the Amiga's interface is, so why are
there so few GUI tools for the Amiga?  GUIs have been around long enough now
that it's about time compiler vendors started thinking of interface toolkits
as part of the necessary minimum standard rather than an optional extra.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    The other C compilers I have used are GCC on the Amiga and Borland
C++ on the PC.  Comparison to Borland C++ is hardly fair, given the very
different markets the products are aimed at; I don't think it counts as a
"similar product".

    GCC has the obvious advantage of being free.  DICE's user interface
is so much better there's no comparison.  GCC is ported from UNIX and takes
the standard UNIX "user friendly is for wimps" attitude.  DICE is much
smaller and faster; GCC produces better optimised code.  Both include many
additional tools and extensive online documentation; DICE's is better
organised and easier to use.  GCC includes C++ as well as C.  DICE has many
features adapted for writing Amiga-specific code; GCC has practically none.
Executables produced by DICE are the property of the writer and can be
distributed under whatever terms you choose, whereas those produced by GCC
are subject to the General Public Virus, sorry, Licence.

    [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  I am not sure that Ross's statement about GCC
    and the GNU Public Licence is correct.  I am checking it out.
    - Dan]

    DICE's natural competitor is SAS C, which I've never used.  SAS is
far more expensive; I gather it includes counterparts to most of the tools
provided with DICE.  SAS's editor is reputed to be fairly minimal, whereas
DICE includes two full-featured editors; but there are enough good editors
available in the commercial, shareware, and PD worlds that this is probably
not an important consideration.  SAS includes some C++ features, although
since it lacks templates and exceptions it can't be considered a serious C++
development system).  DICE is plain C only.  Like GCC, SAS does much better
optimisation than DICE; I don't know how it compares in compilation speed,
or whether it includes the equivalent of VMAKE or an interface toolkit.  I
assume SAS's debugger works properly.


BUGS

    I've described the few bugs I found elsewhere in this review.  I've
contacted the support address about the debugger problem and the Enforcer
hit but have received no reply so far.


VENDOR SUPPORT

    Internet, Compuserve, and US Mail addresses are given for support.
Although I've received no reply after a couple of weeks to my query about
the debugger, I have received very helpful replies to some questions about
AME.


WARRANTY

    None.


CONCLUSIONS

    Overall, despite a few minor niggles and one major one, I like
DICE.  The compiler is very fast, and produces good enough code for all but
the most speed-critical applications, and the other tools are well-chosen,
well-designed, easy to use, and highly customisable.  I recommend DICE 3.0
highly to anyone interested in C programming on the Amiga.

    I give it 8 out of 10, rising to 8.5 if they fix that hole in the
debugger and the Enforcer hit in VOPTS.

PRODUCT NAME

    DSS8+ sound sampler, version 2.01.


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

    Digital Sound Sampler 8+ (DSS8+) is an audio digitizer.  It consists
of a sampling/digitizing hardware interface and a sampling, editing, and
sequencing program that allows you to digitize, edit, combine and play back
audio samples.

LIST PRICE

    I do not know the list price of the product, but I paid $99.95 in US
dollars from my local Amiga dealer in Portland, OR, USA.

    
SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
    
    HARDWARE

        Supports all current Motorola CPU's including the 68040.
        The card is processor independent for compatibility, but
        dependent inasmuch as speed is concerned.

    SOFTWARE

        None.
    

COPY PROTECTION

    None.

        
MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    Amiga 2500 (rev 4.5).
    2 MB Chip RAM, 4 MB Fast RAM.
    Kickstart version 37.300, Workbench version 38.35 (AmigaDOS 2.x).


INSTALLATION

    Installation is easy and uses the Commodore Installer program.  I
selected the Expert Mode and found most of the defaults to be standard:  the
Novice selection wouldn't have been much different.  The Installer script,
however, doesn't seem to like my GigaMem partition, but the requester can be
closed, so that is a moot point.  I applaud GVP for having the sense to use
the Commodore Installer, and besides, I like their install icon better
anyway. 

    The hardware and software installs easily, and I was up and running
in about five minutes, taking my time. 

    
OVERVIEW

    The DSS8+ package is a clear polycarbonite casing showing the
internals of the circuit board.  It has a non-pass-through parallel port
connector, two RCA mini phono plugs, and a standard mini DIN microphone
connector between them.

    The included software, DSS8+ Digital Sound Studio V2.01, looks very
similar to the previous version which was included in the original DSS8.
Included are two double density floppy disks, the first marked Install, has
the Program, utilities, and player. The second disk contains several very
nice samples of high quality. 

                
REVIEW

    The software's interface, while reminiscent of other programs for
music mods and meds, is unique in having single display.  It can be changed
by selecting the operating mode, like sampler, editor, or tracker.  This
makes for easy transition from one functional aspect of the program to
another.  The VCR style controls make the program intuitive to use and give
instant feedback.  As they claim, the screen is designed to resemble a
mixing and editing console like in a sound studio.

    Features abound in this inexpensive digital sampler -- not a bad
little unit -- with real time echo, reverb, oscilloscopes, and spectrum
analysis.  Just about everything is mouse editable, including sample
amplitude levels, waveform functions, and supports cut and paste type work.
I'm not sure if it uses the clipboard, but it would be a natural extension
of the editor.  There are effects (F/X) and processing for echo, mixing,
filters, and resampling.  Currently only the IFF, Sonix, and Raw file
formats are supported; however, it is compatible with most sound tracker and
noise tracker modules, so this really isn't a problem unless you use OctaMED
(currently not supported).

    A key feature I like is the ability to create self-playing music
modules for demo purposes.  This allows others to hear your work without
having to use a separate player program!  Nice touch, in my opinion.
Although I'm not a professional musician, I have found the tracker module up
to par for creating some pretty impressive mods.  It can create sampled
instruments with 1, 3, and 5 octaves, and supports MIDI triggered note
inscription.  You can also add multiple effects for each note, so its a lot
like OctaMED in this regard.  
    
    The tutorial is excellent, and except for the glib and cryptic
explanation of creating a real time sample, it is pretty straightforward.
It states only that the "microphone jack is also available for input when
the Mixer is selected."  This is simply done by clicking on the STEREO
gadget, so this is just a small complaint about semantics.

    When setting the gain for sampling, I recommend using the Autogain
to get a feeling for where to start, then dropping back and resampling until
you're at the bottom edge of clipping on the oscilloscope.  This produces
the best sound without added distortion from clipping.  Speaking of
distortion, my A1960 monitor emits a really bad whine that is picked up by
the DSS8+ as a frequency modulated tone that sounds like a 1000 Hz tone
riding the sample.  I have to turn off my monitor every time I record, as
I've not found a satisfactory manner to shield the unit from the apparent
RFI.  In HiFi mode the screen blanks out, yet the whine persists, so be
alert to this as a possibility in your system.

    While some will feel that the ability to have 31 samples in memory
simultaneously is insufficient, that alone takes approximately 3 MB, not
including free RAM for editing nor the program itself.  So, for all intents
and purposes, even though it will work on one megabyte machines, it really
shines with at least four, and definitely more, especially chip RAM, where
samples are generated before being buffered off to fast RAM.


DOCUMENTATION

    The documentation comes in an 82-page, spiral bound booklet that can
lie flat or be propped up on the keyboard for easy reference.  The layout is
logical and easily followed.  First is the overview, followed by the
installation procedures, which are very well documented, leaving nothing to
guesswork. The tutorial follows, and is basically a quick look at the
different modules and their functional layout and control subsystems.

    After the brief basics are addressed, a very succinct reference
section follows, covering in detail all aspects of the DSS8+ and giving
lavish examples throughout.  First rate explanations of all features, and
examples of each one, make for easy reading and reference.

    After the splendid reference section are appendices covering
keyboard shortcuts, hexidecimal notation, and basic sound and music theory.
Even then, GVP includes a well-thought-out customer complaint form and
configuration form for trouble shooting, should the need ever arise...
which I doubt, but it is a nice touch.

    The index is actually cross-referenced, so it makes relating various
functional aspects a lot easier.  About the only complaint I have is that
GVP claims to support ARexx, but there's no reference to it anywhere in the
documentation.  There is a drawer titled ARexx, however, which contains
scripts to control right channel gain, left channel amplitude, DC offset,
ARexx start, and ARexx quit.  A little addendum or README file would have
been better than no documentation at all.  At least they are supporting
ARexx and assigning ports.

    The documentation is very straightforward and covers every aspect of
installation, use, and maintenance.  All levels of expertise are covered, and
beginners to experts alike won't be disappointed or confused by the
nomenclature.


LIKES

    I like the ease of use, the intuitive system that is completely
Style Guide compliant, and the use of many of the advanced features found on
the more recent AmigaDOS upgrades.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

    About the only dislike I have is that I have to turn off my monitor
in order to sample live properly.  There is probably nothing that GVP can do
about that, but it may be a problem for other users who use the Commodore
A1960 monitor.

    I'd really like to know why I can save my preferences.  The menu
says I can, but the paths I have for different files default back to the
original ones set by GVP.  Perhaps this is a bug, or maybe their use of
nonstandard requestors makes this happen.  My suggestion: make use of the
standard ASL requestors, and allow full use of the AmigaDOS system calls.

    Another small complaint is that even though my virtual memory shows
up in the System Information requestor, according to both DSS8+ and GigaMem,
none of it is utilized.  With applications like these becoming more
commonplace, and upping the RAM requirements, virtual memory should at least
be supported on a very elementary level.  Even AudioMaster III supports
virtual memory allocation, and it is considerably older than DSS8+.

    Some commodities may not be compatible with the DSS8+.  Magic Menus
causes nasty, unrecoverable alerts.  Power Data completely scrambles the
DSS8+ screen to the point of unreadability.  Needless to say, I no longer
run these commodities, as I value the DSS8+ more, but I would like to see
them work together harmoniously.

    I'd like to see support for other screen modes:  at least HIRES LACE
would be nice.  Then again, this could have been omitted because of RAM
considerations, as there are numerous warnings throughout the documentation
about memory usage and the large files that sampling can create.  Maybe
version three will improve this.

    
COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    The only comparable product I have used is Perfect Sound by Sunrize.
All I can say is that you'd have to go to either a twelve or sixteen bit
unit before you'll find anything in the eight-bit group that will displace
the DSS8+, the current reigning king of sound.  I can think of no better
value for the money in regards to Amiga sound devices.

    
BUGS

    None noted, except for perhaps the conflicts mentioned above.
    
    
VENDOR SUPPORT

    Full addresses, and phone/fax numbers are supplied, but trying to
call a real representative at GVP is difficult at best.  I am not associated
with GVP in any way other than being a satisfied DSS8+ owner.


WARRANTY

    Full one year warranty on parts and the installation software.
Whether the warranty is transferable or not is not mentioned in the
documentation.

    
CONCLUSIONS

    This is an excellent product at a fair price.  Considering the
performance capabilities exhibited, I would hazard a guess that the faster
your machine, the faster the throughput; and the more RAM (both Chip and
Fast RAM) you have, the larger or more samples you can work with at a time.
All in all, this is a product that every Amiga user shouldn't be without.  I
know I'll keep mine a long time!

REVIEW

    The manual tells the story of a race of small furball creatures
called Tinies.  Tinies look like tennis balls with eyes, and according to
the manual, they have a horrid sense of humour.  The Tiny King has
apparently been taken prisoner and been imprisoned in his own castle by a
Tiny with a particularly wicked sense of humour.  Yes, this is where you
come in. :-)

    When the game boots, you're shown a glitchy animated sequence
portraying all this, accompanied by some decent CD audio.  Once you're at the
title screen, you can start a new game or restart one of four saved games.

    The object of the game is simple:  take control of a Tiny and find
your way to the exit of each level.  Your Tiny can walk, run, and jump three
different heights.  As if that isn't enough, your Tiny is also able to
transform into any of 4 colours, each one having a special ability:

        Red    - eats through walls
        Yellow - shoots fireballs to kill nasties
        Green  - swings and climbs on rope
        Blue   - dives underwater

    Green is my favourite.  It's great fun swinging the little critter
back and forth on the rope, then letting go and watching him fly across the
screen and do a couple of somersaults before landing on the ground!

    Not all of the abilities are available all the time.  On some levels,
you may only have one ability, and on others, you might get all 4.  To make
it harder, there are force-field type things which enable or disable an
ability when you pass through them.

    You view the action from the standard platform perspective (side on),
and the levels scroll in all directions.  The game takes place over 8 areas,
with each area having 10 levels based on the same theme.  The levels are
full of all sorts of obstacles designed to reduce your Tiny to an ex-furball
before reaching the exit.  There's trees, water, spikes and loads more, and
of course the usual array of NASTIES.  You must make use of the various
abilities of your Tiny to negotiate these obstacles.

    As you progress into the game, the puzzle element starts rearing its
head.  As well as avoiding (or shooting) all the nasties, you also have to
start solving problems in order to reach the exit.  These puzzles range from
simple things, like finding and using keys, to more complex ones, like moving
blocks and finding secret entrances.  The puzzles rely on the correct choice
of abilities in most cases, and also require some pretty nifty joypad skills
on some of the later levels.

    Every 5 levels, your position is saved in Non-Volatile RAM.


DOCUMENTATION

    The booklet in the CD sleeve has instructions in English, French,
Dutch, Italian and Spanish.  It covers everything you need to know (not a
lot, really) and has some nice black and white drawings.


LIKES

    Great fun.  It's playable, cute, and best of all:  totally silly!
There's something distinctly warped about a 10-pixel high ball of fluff
letting fly with a Streetfighter-style fireball. :-)

    The game-saving feature means you can restart where you left off
instead of playing through all the levels again.  This adds a lot to the
longevity of any game in my opinion; if I can restart where I left off, I'll
keep coming back until I finish it (or go insane).

    The difficulty curve is just about right.  There's plenty of easy
levels before the brain mangling begins.

    The CD tracks on the intro and title screens are really good.
In-game music is only Amiga based, but the tunes are great.

    Although he's very small and not very colourful, your Tiny is nicely
animated and moves well.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

    The in-game graphics are pretty dull; they'd look perfectly at home
in a 512K A500 game 5 years ago.  It doesn't look like any more than about 16
colours, definitely not 32bit CDROM stuff.  Static title and between-level
screens are more colourful though.

    The game doesn't use the full PAL screen.  If you force it into NTSC
using the boot-menu, it runs too fast.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    If you liked The Lost Vikings, you'll like this.


BUGS

    I've found a couple of graphic glitches here and there, but they
don't affect gameplay at all.


VENDOR SUPPORT

    An address and phone/fax number are provided for support.  I haven't
needed to contact them as yet.


WARRANTY

    Unknown.


CONCLUSIONS

    If you're looking to be blown off your seat with stunning visuals
and audio, don't buy this game, because there aren't any.  But do buy it if
you want a game to *PLAY*, because it's got more playability and lastability
than a lot of other stuff around.  An enjoyable blend of platforms, puzzles
and general silliness.

    My rating : 80%

PRODUCT NAME

    GigaMem, revision 3


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

    GigaMem is a virtual memory management program.  It requires an
Amiga computer with hard drive, a processor with an MMU, and at least 3MB of
fast RAM.

    [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  This review assumes that the reader knows what
    virtual memory is.  Briefly, it is a way to make a part of your hard
    drive act like memory (RAM).  This increases the amount of RAM
    available on your Amiga, at the expense of some hard disk space and
    some speed (since hard drive access is slower than RAM access).

LIST PRICE

    I do not know the list price of the product.  The software was
included free with my Oktagon SCSI host adapter which I bought for $129.95
(US) from my dealer.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

    HARDWARE

        3 MB Fast RAM required.  It used for buffer space and
        data caching.

        A hard drive is required.  Sizes up to 1 GB are supported.

        A processor with a memory management unit (MMU) is
        required.

    SOFTWARE

        Works with all AmigaDOS versions.
        Some features are unavailable under older AmigaDOS versions.

        Full functionality is obtained with AmigaDOS 2.1 and above.
        Even though it is compatible with AmigaDOS 3.0, it doesn't
        seem to take advantage of any of the newer features present
        in 3.0 as far as I know.


COPY PROTECTION

    None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    Amiga 2500 (rev 4.5), 2 MB Chip RAM, 4 MB Fast RAM.
    Oktagon SCSI host adapter with Quantum 1080 Empire SCSI-2 hard drive.
    Kickstart version 37.300, Workbench version 38.35.


INSTALLATION

    Installation uses the Commodore Installer and is very easy. I
selected the Expert installation mode and found most of the defaults to be
standard.  Even Novice installation mode wouldn't have been much different.
You can even choose the language in which the installation will occur:
English is the default, while French and German are supported.  If you have
AmigaDOS 2.1 or above, locales are also supported.  The Amiga Style Guide
guidelines are completely supported throughout the entire installation.


REVIEW

    The documentation is written in a "German first, English second"
booklet labeled "GigaMem."  It is well written and includes both
"step-by-step" and "expert" installation descriptions.  Throughout the book
are suggestions, warnings, and helpful tips about hard drive installation,
use, and maintenance.

    After selecting the appropriate mode, you can set the size of the
virtual memory file or partition by using the intuitive editor.  One caveat
here, though, is that you must specify the size of the file in megabytes, so
a partition swap medium would ghost out the choice for swap size.  Once the
size of the file or partition is set, then you have to select the amount of
real RAM you wish to devote to buffers and caches. The recommended amount is
that buffers should have one fourth of total RAM, and caches should be sized
according to the largest file to be handled at one time.  As an example, I
give GigaMem 1MB of buffer RAM and 256K for caching purposes.  Depending on
the size and speed of your drive, you may want to adjust these accordingly,
as they seem to be inversely proportional to the speed of access and use.

    The documentation has several warnings about using the swap file
method, as there may be conflicts with data and other files in the swap
file area.  I use the partition method, giving 175MB to GigaMem for virtual
memory purposes. This ensures that the random read/writes to the drive stay
in a controlled environment, and won't affect other files in any way other
than to allow for larger than normal projects to be done.

    GigaMem comes already set up to be used with several programs, like
AdPro, Deluxe Paint (animation only), and Imagine. I have tested it only
with AdPro, DPaint 4.1, Imagine 2.0, Pro Write 3.2, Scenery Animator 2.05,
and UChessL. While all of these programs worked exceptionally well, with the
one notable exception of DPaint 4.1, the greatest surprise came when I tried
UChessL (V2.83) on my system.  First of all, it requires a 68040 CPU and 8MB
of free RAM, yet it booted cleanly and performed as well as the lesser
versions without any speed penalties.  As to what happened with DPaint 4.1,
it is anybody's guess.  First, I tried a simple morph across 30 frames and
promptly ran out of memory.  Then I tried to concatenate a 750-frame
animation generated by Scenery Animator, and it wouldn't even load the first
frame, even though I set the frame count to 750 and selected the base name
of the file without the frame count extension.  Perhaps this is a problem
with DPaint 4.1, as there have been quite a few patches released for
different versions.

    One caveat here in regards to speed of access and use.  A friend of
mine tested GigaMem on his machine, a stock A4000/040 with 8MB fast RAM and
2MB chip RAM.  Due to his having a slower IDE drive and no burst mode,
GigaMem slowed down his system to a bearable crawl, while my system went 3-5
times faster.  The two controlling factors appear to be the speed of the
drive and the speed of the RAM.  On a fast system, this is a moot point, as
my virtual memory speed tests somewhere in between Fast and Chip RAM.  The
A4000 showed its Fast RAM to be about half as fast as mine, and the Chip RAM
about the same, while the virtual memory was dog slow (approximately one
fifth the speed of Fast RAM).  So for the need of working on large projects
that are RAM intensive like image processing and rendering on a fast machine
with a fast drive, GigaMem is a very cost-effective means to an end, without
a great deal of expense in hardware.

    All in all, this is a fine product from a supportive and growing
company, and I would highly recommend getting the program if you are in the
market for a fast and inexpensive method of RAM acquisition.


DOCUMENTATION

    The printed documentation comes in a 96-page perfect bound booklet,
with the first half in German, the second in English.  My congratulations to
the writers for the excellent translation and low spelling error count.  The
documentation is very straightforward and covers every aspect of
installation, use, and maintenance.  All levels of expertise are covered, and
beginners to experts alike won't be disappointed or confused by the
nomenclature.


LIKES

    I like the ease of use, the intuitive system that is completely
Style Guide compliant, and the use of advanced features from recent
AmigaDOS versions.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

    About the only dislike I had was that in order to use a program, it
has to be on the database, which is included.  As an example, I tried to drag
and drop (like an AppIcon in this respect) the icon for GVP's DSS8+ sound
sampler hardware.  Although it registered on the memory allocation counter
in DSS, it wouldn't use any virtual memory whatsoever.  What was really
surprising is that there is support in the database for AudioMaster III/IV,
and yet DSS is left out.  I tried editing the AudioMaster and DSS files
manually, but was unable to get it to work.  Since sound files can be quite
large, and DSS is a pretty well established product, I cannot understand why
it wasn't included, or why GVP won't allow for the use of virtual memory.
Maybe in future releases we'll see it.

    As for DPaint 4.1, I don't know why it wouldn't make even a small
animation, like a morph, or even a large one of 750 frames from a Scenery
Animator animation I did for a project.  FRED, however came through, even
though it uses Chip RAM for the thumb nails it generates to make the
animation from the frames generated.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    The only comparable product is the shareware product VMM040 which
requires a 68040 processor, so I was unable to test it.  My friend with the
A4000/040 tried to use VMM040, and couldn't get it to work at all, as the
documentation leaves a lot to be desired and assumes a complete knowledge of
the inner workings of an MMU-bearing 68040 processor.  Definitely not for
the faint of heart.  Other than that, I am not aware of any other comparable
products that are generally available.


BUGS

    None noted.


VENDOR SUPPORT

    Full addresses, and phone/fax numbers are supplied, but the hotline
for technical support is sent back only after registration card is received
by BSC.  I am not associated with BSC/Alfa Data in any way except as a
satisfied customer.


WARRANTY

    One year warranty on software and the installation software.
Warranty appears to be transferrable, as no mention is made either way as to
the transfer of title.


CONCLUSIONS

    This is an excellent product at a fair price, and considering the
performance capabilities exhibited, I would hazard a guess that the faster
your machine, the faster the throughput.  According to SysInfo 3.14, I get a
speed of my virtual memory in between the speed of my Fast and Chip RAM.  It
would appear that faster processors coupled with faster drives will produce
the best results, naturally enough, but faster than your average comparably
equipped machine.  I'd give GigaMem a rating of 4+ stars out of 5 and a full
five stars if they make the appropriate changes to the database, allowing
use of Digital Sound Studio and DPaint 4.1.

LIST PRICE

    None.  The author asks that you make cards.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

    HARDWARE

        An Amiga with the AGA graphics chip set.

        The documentation implies that the program runs on a
        stock Amiga 1200, so it will certainly run with 2 MB of
        Chip RAM.

        2 MB free hard disk space required.

    SOFTWARE

        Requires Workbench 3.x. (goes with the AGA at this time...)


COPY PROTECTION

    None.  Installs on a hard disk.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    Amiga 4000/030, 2 MB Chip RAM, 12 MB Fast RAM.
    External 880K floppy, 1.76MB internal floppy.
    Internal 130MB Seagate and 245MB Quantum IDE hard drives.
    1950 Monitor.
    Kickstart/Workbench 3.0.


INSTALLATION

    The program installs using the standard Commodore installer
program, and did so without errors.


REVIEW

    Klondike is the classic "Solitaire" game played with one person
(hence, "Solitaire") and a deck of cards.  The player deals out 7 piles
containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 cards respectively, with the top card in
each pile face up.  The object of the game is to build "chains" of cards,
descending from King down to Ace with alternating red and black cards, and
then collect all cards into stacks by suit.  If you can do this, you win.
The complete rules for Klondike Solitaire can be found in just about any
book of card games.

    After doing the installation, I read the docs. :)  This is necessary
so you can understand how the preferences text file works.  Preferences
settings are stored in a text file in the same directory as the program, and
you edit it with any text editor.  I am quite familiar with this kind of
customizing myself, but there are other people who would prefer some sort of
GUI for this purpose.  The default settings work, but you might want to
choose another display mode since the default is "PAL interlaced."  Available
display modes are PAL LACE, DBLPAL, and Super72.  The docs clearly explain
how to change this, and the preference file also contains comments
explaining things quite clearly.

    My first attempt to run the program didn't work too well... actually,
not at all.  After tinkering with it off and on for a week, I found that the
medplayer.library in my LIBS directory was smaller than the one in the first
of the three archives.  After extracting the library and placing it into
LIBS, the program worked!  It seems that the Install script checked that I
had the right version, but didn't check file lengths.  (Understandable....)

    After 'ooh'ing and 'ahh'ing over the default deck of cards and
playing to try and see all the cards, I installed six other decks from the
Aminet ftp site and started up again.  All of them, beautiful!  Inspiring!
(I'm working on a deck now, myself. :))  The filenames on Aminet are
animeCards.lha, ArtCards.lha, Cindy-cards.lha, faces-cards.lha,
hajimecards.lha, and woman-cards.lha.

    Now, less about my own experiences and more comments on gameplay.
During the game, you can change card sets by pressing a number between 0 and
9, making ten card sets available at any time.  Card sets are assigned to
these keys in the preferences file, and how to do this is clearly explained.

    You can change screen modes with a keystroke and toggle the music on
and off with another.  It's nice music, but after an hour, ANY music wears
thin.  The same is done for restarting the game, and pressing escape
immediately exits the game.  This is good and fast, but you also have to
watch that nobody and nothing touches any part of your keyboard during a
game, as a single keypress can cause the game to exit, restart, or change
card sets (some sets you might not want some people to see... ;)).  While
playing, you can double-click cards to move them to the stacks at the bottom
of the screen (Ace, two, three, four, etc. of a suit).  You can also grab
multiple cards and move them from one column to another by clicking the
highest card in the column you want to move, then clicking on the
destination.  If you're a little shaky (caffeine, or the morning after a
night of drinking... :)) and click the wrong place, the game highlights a
box around the cards you are about to move so you can see exactly which
cards your operation will affect.  Cards may be drawn from the draw pile
singly or in threes, depending on the skill level you chose in the
preferences file.


DOCUMENTATION

    The game comes with a fairly good documentation file.  It isn't an
AmigaGuide document, but it conveys the basics in short order such that
AmigaGuide isn't really needed.  Taking into account that English is not the
writer's native language, the documentation is very good.  It gives
step-by-step instructions for installation, setting preferences, and
creating your own deck of cards.  Everything you need to know is conveyed
succinctly and clearly.  The only thing it does not describe is how much
hard drive space a full installation takes up.

    The documentation assumes little beyond being able to use a text
editor to edit the preferences file, which is a reasonable assumption, I
think.  The instructions for making a deck of cards assume quite a bit of
knowledge and uses acronyms for software that might not be clear to someone
unacquainted with the software mentioned.  However, I think that if you
can't understand the instructions, you probably won't have the know-how to
make a deck anyway.


LIKES

    The stunning graphics!  Now THIS is a product that shows off AGA!
The card sets I've downloaded from Aminet so far look GREAT (see review soon
to come of the card sets on Aminet to date) and sometimes are so visually
distracting that it affects my gameplay....  (It depends on the deck. ;))
The speed is great, the gameplay is great (follows my favourite variation of
Klondike by default), and it has the 'niceties' expected in a solitaire card
game for card stack manipulation.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

    I didn't like the way that the Install script wasn't able to tell me
there was a problem with the library.  However, being a programmer, I can
understand how it would be hard (impossible?) to detect that your program
has suddenly leapt beyond the end of the library's code and started trying
to execute random memory contents.... :)

    I am particular about Install scripts that put files into my system
directories without asking me first.  Klondike's Install script put a file
called REKO into my C: directory without asking.  This program is needed to
generate a set of cards from pictures, and would have been fine in the game
directory as it would rarely be used by all but the most productive artist.

    The means of configuring the software works for me, but could be
improved.  Perhaps a configuration window that opens from within the program
via a menu would be nice.  I can't complain about support for other display
modes, which is something I think some people do by reflex. :)  If you have
an AGA machine, you can easily use one of the display modes available, and
using NTSC would only make the cards less detailed.

    I think it would also be a good idea to require the user to hold
down the Amiga (qualifier) key when typing commands at the keyboard.  It's
not any harder for a user, and it makes it easier to keep from changing
something accidentally during play.  The use of qualifier keys would also
allow for more decks of cards to be used in one configuration file (i.e.,
Amiga-<0-9>, shift-<0-9>, and control-<0-9> for up to thirty decks!).  A
move could also be made to menus, but I don't think that's necessary and
would be happy with the use of qualifying keys.  I'd just like some way of
having more than ten decks (hoping the number existing will soon surpass
that number... :)).


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    To date, I haven't used any other solitaire card programs on the
Amiga.


BUGS

    Just a couple, and both have to do with the sound.

    1) When you press 'm' to turn the music off, it completely disables
any and all sound output from your Amiga!  I wanted to use my mod player to
play some different music, but no go....

    2) The docs say that if you try to change screenmodes to one you
don't have installed, the program will exit.  This it does...  however, it
leaves the music playing.  Reloading the game didn't allow me turn the music
off, and I had to reboot to turn it off.

    I have not yet informed the authors of these bugs, as they only gave
a postal mail address in the documentation, and it's in the Netherlands.
Perhaps someone who lives there reads this review? :)


VENDOR SUPPORT

    Haven't attempted to get any.


WARRANTY

    None.  Doesn't need one... :)


CONCLUSIONS

    This card game is a must for any AGA Amiga-owner.  Even if you don't
like Klondike solitaire, you'll still enjoy the eye-candy aspect of it.

    I give the game **** (four stars out of five).  If the configuration
were a little friendlier, it had support for more decks in one config file,
it had an AREXX port (just kidding! :)), and those bugs were fixed, it would
easily earn the fifth star.

MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    Amiga 1200.
    Commodore 1942 Monitor.
    Microbotics MBX1230 with
        68030 CPU running at 33 MHz
        68882 FPU running at 33 MHz
        8 MB RAM

REVIEW

    I bought this card at the World Of Commodore show in Pasadena, CA in
1993.  At the time, there were two other 68030 cards for the A1200 which I
was aware of.  The GVP card seemed rather expensive, and the price of GVP RAM
is far too expensive.  The other card (which I believe to be the RCS card)
had many attractive features (such as a future SCSI-II add-on); however, I
didn't couldn't justify spending extra money on features which I couldn't see
myself using.  Therefore I ended up with the MBX1230 card.

    I had used a MicroBotics product before in my Amiga 500 -- a VXL*30
card with 68030 CPU and 2 MB RAM -- and I was rather displeased with it.  I
was a bit skeptical of my new purchase, and shortly after I had it in my
hands, I thought that I was a fool for purchasing it.  It turns out that
these thoughts were completely unfounded.

    Once I got the card home, I began to install it in my A1200.  I
installed the software, and the installation was flawless.  Then I tried to
install the hardware which turned out to be quite a trial.  The directions
say to slide the card gently into place, but it took almost more force than
I had to get it into place.  Finally, just as I was about to give up, I
thought to use a lever to get it in.  When I used the lever, the card slid
in very easily.

    I then rebooted the computer and...  IT WORKED!  YEAH!!!  My
computer was now a LOT faster, and it had 10 megabytes of RAM too!  That was
the last time that I saw the card.  It has been running in my A1200 ever
since.  As of this date (May 18, 1994), the computer has been turned off for
a total of about four days.  The bottom of my A1200 is quite warm, but I have
had no problems with the heat as of yet.


DOCUMENTATION

    The documentation for this card is sparse but adequate to get up and
running.


LIKES

    + I like the SPEED!  Of course you would get the speed with any other
      accelerator, but it's nice anyway. :)

    + The card was relatively easy to install.  There aren't hundreds of
      screws to deal with (and lose).  I would recommend a lever to get
      the card in though.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

    - The card requires a patch at the beginning of the startup-sequence
      in order to add the "Auto-Config" RAM.  They say that AmigaDOS 3.1
      should fix the problem; however, this doesn't seem to be a problem
      with the other boards.

    - The card "supports" up to 128 megabytes of RAM; however, it has
      only one SIMM socket.  Where do you find a 128M SIMM???  I have
      trouble finding 16M SIMMs!  If there were two sockets, then I could
      just pop in another 8M SIMM, but I'm kind of stuck with 8M until I
      can find a 16M SIMM.  I'm not even going to bother looking for 32M
      SIMMs.

COMPARISON TO OTHER PRODUCTS

    I can't compare this product as I have never owned another
accelerator card for the Amiga 1200.  Compared to the VXL*30 card though,
this is a MUCH better product.


BUGS

    I haven't run into any bugs at all!


SUPPORT

    I have not required support for my MBX1230 card; however, I did
require support for my VXL*30 card and the support people were very friendly
and responsive towards my needs.  I don't think this will have changed much.


WARRANTY

    I can't seem to find my warranty information, or else I would tell
you about it.


CONCLUSIONS

    I would definitely recommend this product to any Amiga 1200 owner who
doesn't have a need for SCSI support.  I would also recommend that any low to
midrange users who want to save a couple of dollars should omit the purchase
of the 68882, as it doesn't help much with day to day use.  If you are using
math-intensive applications, it is important; however, that is a rare case
for me (and I imagine for most people).  I would also recommend that anyone
purchasing an Amiga 1200 buy at least SOME kind of 32-bit RAM, at least 2M's.

Date: 23 May 1994 03:42:37 GMT
Message-ID: <2rp8nd$fg9@masala.cc.uh.edu>


PRODUCT NAME

    Rush, release 2, version 37.5370


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

    Rush is a shareware directory utility.  A demo version is available
on the Aminet ftp sites in /pub/aminet/util/dir/RushDem2.lha.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

    Name:       Douglas Keller
    Address:    3A Hudson Harbour Drive
            Poughkeepsie, NY  12601
            USA

    E-mail:     dkeller@bix.com


LIST PRICE

    Shareware:  $25.00 (US) for the registered version.  Upgrade from
Directory Opus is $15.00 (US) if you send in the first page from a Directory
Opus manual.

    There are two differences between the demo and registered versions.
In the demo, the gadget assignments cannot be saved (although the
preferences can be edited tediously by hand), and a naggy little requester
pops up (forcing Rush to the front of the display) every now and then.

    The copyrighted demo version can be distributed like any shareware
product.  The registered version cannot be distributed (obviously).


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

    HARDWARE

        None.

    SOFTWARE

        Requires AmigaDOS 2.0 or higher.


COPY PROTECTION

    None.  Installs on a hard disk.


OVERVIEW

    Rush is a directory utility along the lines of Directory Opus and
the MANY other PD and commercial directory utilities.  It has a friendly and
very configurable user interface with two directory list windows separated by
a row of command buttons. The interface is configurable as to its screen mode
(including all 2.04 and 3.0 modes), fonts (both for the list windows and
buttons), and colors (up to 256 with AmigaDOS 3.0+).  The buttons can be
configured to do any command imaginable, including commands loaded from disk
(such as AmigaDOS commands, Viewtek, ZGIF, etc.), ARexx commands,
assignments to devices, or a host of standard internal commands (such as
Copy).  Rush handles archives in a unique way and can be configured to
recognize any archive type.  Similarly, files types can be recognized (e.g.,
JPEG graphics files), and double-clicking on a file can be configured to
execute the appropriate command associated with the file (e.g., FastJPEG for
viewing JPEG images:  "c:FastJPEG %s".).  It is pleasantly simple to 'teach'
Rush to recognize file types via a sample of that file type.  These features
are packed into a program that when run takes up less than 180K of your vital
memory.


SPECIAL FEATURES

    AmigaGuide support:
        Rush has good documentation in AmigaGuide format that can be
        run from the program.  Hold the mouse over a portion of the
        screen and press the HELP key, and documentation on that
        portion will be displayed (nifty).

    Archive Handling:
        As mentioned, Rush uniquely handles archives and can
        recognize ANY format.  The commands for adding to, listing,
        and extracting can be configured for each archive type.  A
        double-click can also cause any of these commands to be
        executed.

    Mouse clicks:
        The right and left (and center) mouse buttons can be
        configured to execute ANY internal command.  I have
        configured my right button to execute the 'Parent' command.

    Sort Lists:
        The ListViews (scrolling lists) can be each configured to
        sort their contents several different ways:  by name, date,
        size, forward (alphabetically), backward, directories first,
        directories last, etc.

    Wildcards:
        The program supports wildcards throughout.  For example,
        you could select all the #?.mod files in a directory
        easily by entering the wildcard, and clicking "All".

    Keystrokes:
        All button commands can be (but don't HAVE to be) duplicated
        with keystrokes.

    There are several other good and unique features.  Download the
demo, and see for yourself.


LIKES

    I have used many many many many directory utilities, including
Directory Opus, Directory Master, MTool, Directory Works, and so on.  I have
always wanted a POWERFUL, configurable program that didn't take up half a
megabyte of memory.  I have finally found this in Rush.  After messing with
it for a week, I registered right away.

    Rush runs fully bug free for me so far, and it is supported by a good
programmer who wrote the first version over three years ago and promises
updates (via e-mail even).  Although Rush isn't the most configurable
directory utility I have ever seen, it skips all the really useless stuff
and has ALL the options I have ever wanted.  Other directory utilities have
either left out at least one IMPORTANT option, or have been so big and
kludgy that they aren't worth it.  Finally, a program that really strikes
the balance.

    SPEED... Rush is quick.  It beats both Directory Opus and Directory
Master 2 in reads, copies, and deletes, hands down, and Douglas promises to
speed it up even more with caching in the future.  Plus it is thoroughly
tested with the developer debugging tools Mungwall and Enforcer.  (There are
no Enforcer hits.)

    I have been able to configure Rush to do several complex tasks such
as play MPEGS, offering me a choice between greyscale and HAM8 modes on the
fly, and simple things like uuencode/uudecode files.

    The demo version isn't horribly crippled, so I was able to enjoy the
program before I bought it.  This is wise in my opinion, since I will just
toss a demo that is severely crippled or bothers me with 5 minute lockups or
windows that never go away. :)


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

    1. Not font sensitive (yet).
    2. Doesn't treat archives like directories (yet).
    3. Menus aren't configurable (yet).

These all are promised for future releases.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    See the "LIKES" section, above.


BUGS

    None found so far.


CONCLUSIONS

    Good work Mr. Keller! Download the Rush2 demo, and give it a try.

REVIEW

    This is a MAJOR upgrade to TypeSMITH 2.01, almost as big as the
difference between TypeSMITH 1 and TypeSMITH 2.  I'll review the whole
program, trying to highlight the differences between 2.01 and 2.02, while
still making sense to folks that don't own any version of TypeSMITH (yet).

    If you need to produce a high-quality outline font on the Amiga, I
believe TypeSMITH is the only choice.  Fortunately, it's a very respectable
program, and it keeps getting better.  Much like Fontographer on the
Macintosh, this program lets users create their own publication-quality
fonts that will print without "jaggies" on high resolution printers.  It
also lets users tweak an existing font to add a character, modify a
character, or whatever.  Its drawing tools are sufficient to create almost
any kind of figure, and TypeSMITH can export character shapes as IFF DR2D
drawings for use with other Amiga programs.

    I've used it to create a PostScript font of my handwriting (it
actually looks uncannily real...) as well as to create a more normal text
font.  For the handwriting font, I wrote an alphabet on paper, scanned it
(on a PC), and read the file into DPAINT 4 where I saved each letter as an
IFF brush.  TypeSMITH was able to read each bitmap, scale it appropriately,
and put it in the background (in grey) to be traced over.  It has an
"autotrace" feature that makes the tracing task much easier.  (You still
have to do significant touch-up, but it saves a lot of mouse-work.)

    TypeSMITH has always been able to edit PostScript fonts, but version
2.02 makes this even easier by being able to read PFA format as well as PFB
format fonts.  (Previously, PFA files had to be converted with the "dl2pfb"
program.)  Using this feature, I've been able to examine all the fonts on
the new Bitstream 500 fonts CDROM (windows version, only $30) as well as the
other PostScript fonts I own.

    Among the new features in 2.02 is the ability to edit the character
widths from the edit window, which is really nice.  Also, points can be
moved with fine precision now by clicking on them and pressing arrow keys
with the shift key.

    All in all, the program has a very well-tuned feel to it.


DOCUMENTATION

    I'm not much of a documentation reader, and with TypeSMITH, I didn't
have to resort to reading the documentation much, except to figure out how
"composite" characters work, and how they're edited (it's a bit tricky).
All my experiences with the documentation have been fine.


BUGS

    This release fixes a number of bugs that were in version 2.01.
Being a beta tester for them, if there were any bugs I experienced, I would
have told them already, and they would have been fixed.  :)


VENDOR SUPPORT

    The fact that such a major update to TypeSMITH is available for free
on the net (as well as the recent announcement in c.s.a.announce) is clear
evidence of Soft-Logik's continuing commitment to the Amiga.  I think
they're good folks.  I am a beta tester for them (hence the quick review of
this brand new release) and have been impressed with the company from all
sides.


CONCLUSIONS

    I give it a solid 4.5 stars out of 5.  Not that I can think of
anything lacking, but if the program continues to improve, I'll need room in
the rankings to accommodate.

    In light of the strong support Soft-Logik is giving the Amiga, and
that this is such a strong program, I'd highly recommend buying it if you do
anything with desktop publishing or even just have an interest in fonts.
