<font face="verdana"><b><big>About Reboot</big></b></font>
<font face="arial"><p>
Reboot is a utility which allows the user to reboot their system via a menu command (as opposed to using CTRL-AMIGA-AMIGA). The user is then asked to confirm if they want to continue with the reboot.<p>
Reboot was originally written as a replacement to similar programs that reboot your system, but also offer the user a requester to confirm if they actually want to reboot. No more losing your work because you rebooted my mistake!
</font>
<p><br><br>
<font face="verdana"><b><big>Requirements</big></b></font>
<p>
<font face="arial">
Reboot should run under any Amiga (or compatible) set-up with AmigaOS 2.0 or later, although there are plans to make it AmigaOS 3.0+ only.  I cannot say for sure though if it will run properly under AmigaOS 2.0 as I am unable to test Reboot with this version of AmigaOS. It definitely runs okay under AmigaOS 3.0+.
<p>
This software has been tested to work on the following set-ups:-
<p>
- An unexpanded Amiga 1200 with AmigaOS 3.0 and 3.1.<p>
- An Amiga 1200 with AmigaOS 3.0 and 3.1, 8 meg of Fast RAM and a Blizzard 1230-IV.<p>
- An Amiga 1200 with AmigaOS 3.1 and 3.5, 64 meg of Fast RAM, BlizzardPPC 603e/240MHz and 68040/25MHz and a BlizzardVisionPPC 8 meg 3D graphics board.

<font face="verdana"><b><big>Installation</big></b></font>
<p>
<font face="arial">
To install Reboot simply double-click on the "Install Reboot" icon. This should install the program to the "SYS:WBStartup" drawer. You will now need to either reboot your machine or go into your WBStartup drawer and double-click on the Reboot icon. In future releases the install procedure will automatically load the program.

<font face="verdana"><b><big>Instructions for use</big></b></font>
<font face="arial">
<p>
Assuming that the installation process went okay, to activate Reboot, go to the Workbench "Tools" menu (located on the pull-down menu strip) and select "Reboot system". You will then be presented with a requester with two options.
<p>
(1) Reboot - Causes the system to reboot.
<br>
(2) Cancel - Cancels the request to reboot the system.
