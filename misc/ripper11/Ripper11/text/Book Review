It  all  started  with a series of articles written by a bloke  called  Neil
Bothwick,@1( I think he still does some part time work for Amigactive)@5.
@3

     The articles appeared in the now defunct AF, entitled @1"Using HTML".

The tutorial got me started on writing a web page which I managed to get  up
and  running,   and  it  made  me  want  to  progress  onto  something  more
adventurous.I tried some of the@1 WYSIWYG@5 programs,  but I felt that I  wanted
more control over what I was doing.

I  wanted  to understand what was going on inside the web browser.   So  the
best way to do this was to go out and buy a book that was easy enough for  a
complete beginner but didn't talk down to you.

I set myself a budget of £20, and went to the local book shops with money in
hand.   And after looking at a dozen or so books in my price range  it  soon
became very clear which was the clear winner.

Many  of  the books where written for complete idiots,@1( it's obvious Windows
does that to you!)
@5
Others  required a degree or a doctorate,  but this book was  a  breathe  of
fresh  air  in  the  way it was laid out and in the way  it  helped  you  to
understand HTML.

As  soon  as  I  read  in  the Preface@3"I'll let you into  a  secret  -  HTML
@1(Hypertext Markup Language)@3  is simple.Its vocabulary contains no more  than
a few dozen words, and its syntax is clear and logical."
@5
I  knew  that  was  the  book for me.  With its clear  chapter  headings  on
everything you need,  in the order you need them. Good diagrams and examples
for you to copy and progress with.

In  no  time  at all I had my web site running with family pages and  photos
and Amiga links to all my favourite sites.  It makes me feel proud that with
a  little help from Neil and a good reference book,  I've been able to  join
the World Wide Web and make something that I can be proud of.
