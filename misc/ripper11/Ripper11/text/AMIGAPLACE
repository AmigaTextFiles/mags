I  recently read an article on the Microsoft web site on how to remove Linux
from  your PC and install Windows.  After some searching,  I found a  rather
interesting  take  on  how to do the reverse.  I  thought  it  prudent  that
someone  write  a similar article on how to replace the  PC  with  an  Amiga
system... this is it.

In  order  to complete the objective as swiftly and efficiently as possible,
it  is  best to first set assigns to the best avenue to reaching  the  goal.
You could call this formulating the plan,  and could map it by flow chart or
doing an outline.  Safety is top priority,  so your first item should be  to
quarantine the area.  No humans, animals, or sub-humans should be allowed in
the  vicinity of the PC.  PC's are known for being hazardous to ones  health
during  the best of times,  so how do you think the little bastard is  going
to  react  when it realizes you are getting rid of it? You should also  have
the proper tools on hand to perform the needed task.

The following items may prove helpful@1:  1)  Screwdriver 2) Hammer 3) pinking
shears 4)  Pliers 5)  crow bar 6)  chain-saw 7)  Bug-B-Gone @3(or other strong
pesticide)@1  8)  Penguin-B-Gone 9)  Hair tonic 10)  Holy Water 11) King James
Bible  12)  rubber gloves 13)@5  Shaman or Priest to watch over the  procedure
@3(if none is avail then burn your house to the ground,  PC and all,  and skip
to final step)
@5
Now that you have the tools for the job,  and a sketch of your approach,  it
is time to put the plan into action.
@4
                                   Step 1.
@5
Make  sure  before you enter the room containing the PC,  that it  is  night
time,  and all lights are off to the room.  It might even be a good idea  to
cut  the  breaker  off in order to be sure that there is  no  power  to  the
machine.   On  second thought,  it is even a better idea to have  the  power
company  remove the lines to your house a few days in advance of this  task,
to ensure that no power is to the PC.  Enter the room slowly.  It should  be
dark  enough  that  any residual penguins or windows bugs  will  not  notice
movement.  Approach your PC carefully watching for any of the aforementioned
critters. Moving swiftly, and using the spray nozzle attachment on your bug-
b-gone @3(or Penguin be gone depending on the OS installed in the PC)@5,   spray
directly  into  the  floppy disk drive. @3 (note:  This will  not  disarm  the
system, just temporarily stun it)



@4
                                   Step 2.
@5
Disconnect all power,  peripheral,  and monitor leads from the CPU  at  this
time (you may find it necessary to use the chain saw).  While these items do
not  have  Windows or Linux installed on them,  chances are  that  they  are
contaminated,  and should be plugged in,  and submerged in a bathtub full of
Holy  water,   while you read from the book of Revelations.  If  they  still
function  after  this ritual,  then burn them because  they  are  definitely
possessed.  Now that you have isolated the CPU, it is much less of a threat,
but still should be handled with great care.  Carefully remove the case  off
of the machine by taking the screws out of it with the screwdriver.  The top
of  the case is of little value,  but I have found that even after long term
exposure  to  Windows and Linux,  the material used in construction  of  the
outer case is still safe to handle.  For that reason,  after completing  the
system  swap,   you  can use the pinking shears to cut  out  Christmas  tree
ornament shapes from the case, so all is not wasted.



@4
                                   Step 3.
@5
Now that you have the computer open,  you can see the source of the problem.
I  do  not  need  to go into great detail here,  because  it  will  be  very
obvious.   Very  carefully detach the hard disk drive. @3 ( I recommend  using
gloves)@5   and  set it to the side for re-use.  Remove any  simms  or  memory
modules as well,  this is where the pliers are handy.@3 (chances are that they
are  hopelessly  contaminated,  but with holes already in the  corners  they
make  for  another  nifty ornament) @5 Grasping the hammer  with  BOTH  hands,
strike  down  upon the CPU.  If you are unsure whether or not this  achieved
the  needed force,  repeat process with crow-bar while screaming @7 BILLY  BOY
IS  THE  ANTICHRIST!!!@5  or @7 DEATH TO PENGUINS!!! @3 (whichever is appropriate)
@5...and again...and again... and again....
@4
                                   Step 4.
@5
At  this  point it is generally best to remove all the components  from  the
computer@3 (they should be in bits about the same size as a credit  card)@5   to
the kitchen.  Turn your disposer on,  and drop the pieces down it. If you do
not  have a disposer,  either get one installed in a hurry,  OR put all  the
bits into the microwave on high power,  set it for 10 hours,  and leave  the
house for the duration.






@4
                                   Step 5.
@5
I  have found that in order to insure a proper operating environment for the
Amiga system,  it is best to wash the walls,  ceiling, and floor of the room
with holy water,  followed by a good dowsing of bug-b-gone or penguin-b-gone
@3(or both for safety's sake)@5,  prior to setting up your Amiga. @1 NOTE: IN SOME
INSTANCES THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT,  AND IT IS NECESSARY TO BURN THE HOUSE AND
SACRIFICE A LAMB IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE ONUS.  IF THIS IS THE CASE YOU  WILL
NEED  TO  BUY  OR  RENT  ANOTHER  HOUSE  PRIOR  TO  SETTING  UP  THE  AMIGA.
REGARDLESS,   IT  IS NECESSARY TO REMOVE AND BURN ALL FURNISHINGS  FROM  THE
ROOM.






@4
                                 Final Step:
@5
After  purchasing and assembling new furniture for the room,  you are  ready
to  assemble your Amiga system.  Amiga's are VERY user friendly,  so I  will
offer  no  instructions on setting it up.  The hair tonic may  be  handy  to
restore  that  which was lost due to countless BSOD's or   server   crashes.
@1WARNING:   DO  NOT  RE-USE THE HARD DRIVE IN THE AMIGA.   IT  IS  HOPELESSLY
CONTAMINATED.  INSTEAD,  DONATE IT TO YOUR LOCAL YOUTH STREET HOCKEY LEAGUE.

@6
Thanks for reading.  In the next issue, we will discuss how to replace a Mac
with Amiga.#8
