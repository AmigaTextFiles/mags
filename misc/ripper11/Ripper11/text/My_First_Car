                                   Part 1:*2@5


  My first car was a@1 1986 Ford Escort Mk3@5 with a red pearlesant paint job,   4
  new  wheel  arches,   a  new 1.3 engine with  44,000  miles  on  it  and  an
  earbusting  face off stereo system.  I bought it in April  '98  having  just
  past my Theory,  Practical and advanced driving test first time. I bought it
  for  £500 and the insurance was £600.  I didn't care,  I just wanted to  get
  out  in  that  car  and drive it on my own without someone taking  over  the
  controls or shouting down my ear.  I was 18 so as you can imagine it was  my
  pride  and joy.  I  was washing it all the time,  vacuuming it and  cleaning
  every speck of dust off of it.  But still something was missing. Being an 18
  year old@1 "Boy Racer / Raver"@5 this car needed to look like the business  even
  if  it  couldn't  race  a  plastic pig and win.  But  money  is  always  the
  deciding  factor  at this age and having just bought this car,  insured  and
  taxed it I couldn't even afford to fill the tank up.  Luck did pass  my  way
  though as I had a friend who lived very close to me with a Mk2 Escort  which
  had  more  rust than a rust factory.  On this particular Mk2 were very  nice
  FAT  steel 13" wheels with recessed centre sections.  They definitely looked
  better  than my boring old Mk3 wheels so since my mate was selling  the  car
  for  scrap I decided to swap wheels  with him.  I did particularly well  out
  of  this since my old tyres had absolutely no tread on them and the new ones
  where practically brand new.  My friend with the Mk2 finally sold it for £80
  to someone who wanted the engine for a kit-car.

  Fitting the wheels was the fun part.  I wouldn't be surprised if the  wheels
  I  had on it before where the original ones put on at the bloody factory.  I
  was jumping up and down on the wheel brace as though my life depended on  it
  while my girlfriend was blowing the new tyres up with a foot pump.  It was a
  stupendous  sight.  In the end we had to drive it to  the  local  garage  to
  loosen the nuts with an air gun.
  The  next  day  I went out to my car to visit my friend and the  damn  thing
  wouldn't  start.  Being new in this game I was puzzled at what  it  was.   I
  opened  the bonnet to see that the distributor cap was hanging  off  but  it
  wouldn't screw back in because the "bit" it goes into had knackered threads.
  Out  with the cable ties!  It's still connected with two cable ties to  this
  very  day.   While I was under the bonnet I checked a few other things.   It
  turns  out  that the air filter was as black as liqourice and one  pipe  (to
  the manifold I think)  was completely missing.  Off to the scrap yard on the
  Redditch by pass we go.
  On  arrival at the scrap yard we started demolishing the first XR3i we could
  find.  We had practically stripped the car bare when someone came out of the
  little  hut which said@1 "WE ARE WATCHING!"@5 on the side of it next to  a  sign
  which said@1 "OUR DOG EATS THIEVES"@5. The person shouted@4 "what the f**k are you
  doing to that car!!!!"@5.  After my friend had managed to rip the spoiler  off
  an another and  managed to destroyed a pair of  glasses  he'd  found  in the
  glovebox  I  said  sheepishly@3 "how much do you want for the alloys,   seats,
  spoiler, and steering wheel?"@5.
  @4

  "That car isn't for sale,  it's been in a minor accident and is being stored
  here. Does it look like a breaker to you?"
  @3
            "This IS a breakers yard isn't it?"@5 I said sarcastically.
  @4
             "What you after?"@5 he said as he was losing his patience.
  @3
  "Erm .  .  .  . a new dash for my Escort."@5 I said@1 (I couldn't say a pipe and
                                                      an air filter could I?)
  @4
  "All the Escorts are over there"@5 he said pointing at a large pile of mangled
  Escorts.   Then he muttered something about the price of dashes  etc. as  he
  walked back to his hut.

  What  a  crap idea it was looking for a brand new air filter in  a  breakers
  yard.  We did however fill our pockets with the needed pipe,  about  5  gear
  knobs,  20 bulbs and approximately 40 fuses.  It's a good job we brought big
  coats.  It was heads down as we walked through the exit next to the  dreaded
  HUT,   then  a final dash to my car as we got a safe distance from  the  dog
  cage.  I  decided to fit all my newly stolen extras when I got back home. My
  friends agreed.


  So my car now had some new bulbs,  proper amp fuses, a Capri gearknob@1 (which
  it's  still got)@5  and a chunky Sierra steering wheel to replace that  crappy
  Escort one.  The next event was to wake up to a car with a nice dented  rear
  bumper  which was bent enough to scratch a bit of the paint.  I was  f**king
  @1FURIOUS!!!!!@5  This c**t must die.  I pulled the metal bumper back into shape
  and  felt  happy at the fact that it had probably done more  damage  to  the
  other persons car than mine.

  I  finally  got  up motor world and bought an air filter  so  my  car  could
  breathe  without conking out in first gear and to round it off  I  bought  a
  stainless  steel exhaust trim which I got on with a lot of WD-40,   a  screw
  and a huge kick.

  The  kick hadn't done all to good to the exhaust system as I found out about
  3 weeks later.  My car was sounding like a bleedin' Hot Rod,  jees that trim
  really  sounds good I thought.  The truth was that the backbox  was  falling
  off  and  a  lot of exhaust fumes where exiting in the wrong place.  Another
  trip  to the garage saw me back £80 for a backbox and mid section which  was
  also  riddled with holes.  I felt like replacing the downpipe  and  manifold
  as well, NO, might aswell replace the whole engine while I'm at it.@1 OH GET A
  GRIP.@5  That's the last time I buy an exhaust trim 2 times too small for  the
  exhaust.


  Since this was my pride and joy and even a dent in the bumper made me mad  I
  descided to invest in a security system.  It cost me a lot of money  but  it
  was Thatcham II approved so I got double that back off the insurance.  Now I
  had a cheaper premium and peace of mind. Great stuff.

  Being young,  happy and stupid I descided to push my luck with the road  and
  the  road  won.   Flying  round an island at about  30  MPH  at  10PM  in  a
  residential  area took its toll.  I turned a bit too soon as  there  was  an
  oncoming  car on the road I was coming onto.  The front left wheel  hit  the
  strangely  high  curb  and  launched my  car  into  the  air.   As  the  car
  straightened  up  the front left of my car started to  dip  and  I  heard  a
  flapping noise.  It was almost impossible to keep the car in a straight line
  so  I  dived into the curb and skidded to a stop.  I'm surprised  the  shock
  absorber  didn't come through the bonnet.  As I exited the car cursing I saw
  black  clouds looming over an already dark street and didn't like  the  look
  of things at all.  The tyre was split completely and was almost off the rim,
  the  steel wheel had a nice curb shaped dent in it and I was pissed off.   I
  got  the  kit out of the boot and had a choice as there were two  spares  in
  the  boot,  I chose the one with air in it.  I got the f**ked wheel off easy
  enough  but  whoever designed the shape of the inside wheel and  wheel  bolt
  for  the  Escort was a nutter because they are a bloody pain  in  the  arse,
  especially when it's raining. @1 OH NO DON'T RAIN!  BOLLOCKS!@5   I ran  to  the
  nearest house to phone my mom to pick me up planning on fixing it  the  next
  day.   I chose the first house with a light on in it.  An 80 year old  women
  came  to  the  door  and  spoke to me through the letter  box.   I  gave  up
  immediately and went to the next house.  A semi naked women in her 20s  came
  to  the door and I described the situation.  She let me use her phone as she
  hid  on the other side of the door but the answer machine was on.  Oh  well,
  back to work.  After another attempt I was just losing my temper with it and
  threw the wheel  brace on the ground. @1 (It's so much easier in the daylight.
  @5I  ran  back to my girlfriends house who I'd just dropped home.  She  opened
  the  door to see me dripping with rain and oil and got me a towel.  Her  dad
  found a torch,  lent me a coat and we braved the waters once more.  It  took
  about 2 minutes with a torch,  it seemed so easy but there you go. I had one
  odd  wheel but at least I could get home in one piece.  The next day I  went
  up  to Tyresales and they put a new tyre on it and bashed the huge dent  out
  of it. I was happy once more. I didn't drive like that ever again, but I did
  drive faster. #8 Read on.@5 The first problem I noticed with driving the car was
  when  sometimes  the indicators would flash at twice the speed  they  should
  do,   I  could tell this by the display and listening to what the relay  was
  doing,  I suppose it was about time to check the electrics out.   I  got  my
  mate to sit in the car and try the brakes, reverse gear, lights etc. while I
  looked  at  the  car from the rear.@1  WHAT THE F**KS GOING ON?@5 Sometimes  the
  brake  lights wouldn't work,  sometimes they would,  sometimes  the  reverse
  lights worked,  sometimes they decided that they were indicators after  all!
  I  couldn't understand why this was happening.  I looked inside the boot and
  removed the light clusters from their holders for a closer inspection,   the
  bulbs  were  okay but it looked like the wiring loom connectors  were  badly
  designed  and had quite a bit of rust on them,  maybe one day I would  clean
  them up.@2

  LOUD SIREN, @6 BLUE LIGHTS,@3 PANIC,@5 Oops, looks like I've been pulled over! Why
  did  they  have to pull me over now that I had got onto the main trunk  road
  in the rush hour with nowhere to stop?
  @3
                             "Hello, can I help you?"
  @7
  "Yeah you've just got a few problems with the lights, take the next left and
  stop by the pavement please."
  @3
  "Is  it  okay if I take it into the Saracens Head pub on the right,   that's
  where I work."
  @7
                                   "Yeah sure."
  @5
  The  cop  was quite polite and wasn't cocky at all,  I got a bit embarrassed
  when my boss came out to have a look at what was going on but he wasn't  too
  fussed. After asking me to press the brake, lights, reverse etc he asked me:
  @7
                    "Do you know anything about these lights?"
  @3
            "................ er,  a ,          ... U,......... erm?!"
  @7
                   "So nothing that you want to tell us then?"
  @5
                                     I smiled
  @7
  "Well  it  is  an  offence to drive with faulty lights so  this  is  only  a
  warning, you must produce your documents at the police station though"
  @5
  After  taking  my  details  down  they   said  goodbye  and  apologised  for
  embarrassing me in front of my boss.  I got the  work  done  at  nearby  Ian
  Farrels motor company.  It cost £70 and it seemed they had done the job,   a
  bit pricy though.  I produced at the cop shop and all was well...... until a
  month  later.  What was wrong this time? Same problem!  I checked  the  rear
  lights  and  it looked like Ian Farrells had just replaced a few  pieces  of
  plastic in there.  That's one garage I wouldn't be using again.  In the  end
  after  a  miserable attempt at fixing them myself I  took  the  car  to  the
  local  specialist electrical place,  Goodwins.  They practically re-designed
  the  rear  light  clusters  for me and made damn  sure  there  would  be  no
  problems  with  them  in the future.  The guy told me  that  they  had  done
  hundreds  of Escorts and Sierras with the same problem and  that  it  was  a
  design  fault that was rectified somewhat with the mk4 and 5.  Not  bad  for
  £23 eh?


  My  sister  had a 1985 1.8 Nissan Bluebird with 108,000 miles on  the  clock
  and  it had been sitting on her drive for six months ever since she had  got
  their  new  people carrier with her boyfriend.  It was my job to  sell  this
  pile of shit.


  The  air filter was in worse state than my old one,  it was burning as  much
  oil  as  it  was fuel and the battery took 4 days to charge.  This monstrous
  car  still  wouldn't  start  no matter what.  You  could  hear  the  pistons
  scraping!!   My  brother in law who sold me the  Escort  came  round  to  my
  sisters and gave it the works.  He cleaned the points,  checked the  sparks,
  checked  the BLACK oil and gave it some jump leads from his Maestro  Diesel.
  It  took about half an hour but we finally got it started after finding  out
  this  car  had  an immobiliser which was probably worth more than  the  car.@5
  There  was  an almighty roar and a huge cloud of smoke but we had  done  it,
  She  was  alive!  When the smoke finally cleared we saw that the car  parked
  behind  it  had a new type of oily paint job.  At that point we descided  to
  pack  up  and leave.  Stage one complete I was looking forward to stage  two
  which  was  towing  this box back to my house without  getting  pulled.   It
  worked,  it took a bit longer than anticipated but it worked. I was flat out
  in second gear all the way. It felt like I was towing a bloody tank.
  @5

  You know when the sun shines on my car,  the paint really brightens up.   On
  this  Nissan all it did was highlight the rust and birdshit.  It took  me  a
  couple  of  days  to clean it inside and out,  but when I  had  finished  it
  didn't  look  all that bad.  I had to take it round the block  a  couple  of
  times  to  clear the system@1 (and to see what a 1.8 felt like)@5.   A  word  of
  advise,   if your going to buy a car as big as that make sure it  has  power
  steering.  I advertised the thing for £300 which was way more  than  it  was
  worth.   After a few weeks of lookers but no buyers my sister recommended  I
  put it in for an MOT.  It was risky driving it there but it was worth it  if
  it  somehow  passed.   The  nearest MOT station was  Baldwins  Lane  Service
  Station.   I used to live next to the owner of the place so I  was  sure  he
  wouldn't  rip me off.  It cost me £30 just to find out that it  needed  £250
  worth of fixing.  Suspension,  tyres, exhaust nothing real major but even so
  I  couldn't afford it so my sister said I could keep whatever I sold it  for
  since  I probably wouldn't get more that the price of the MOT for it.  After
  2  months  I was tired of seeing the thing out the front of my  house  so  I
  made  a  more concerned effort to sell it.  In the local paper was an advert
  for  an rare RS Motorsport contoured leather steering wheel which was  being
  sold for £75.  Why not I thought and gave them a ring. The steering wheel in
  question  was  a rare one which wasn't available to buy any more and  had  a
  boss kit suitable for my car fitted on it.

  @3
                     "Do you want to swap it for a Bluebird?"
  @2
                             "Tell me more about it."
  @3
                                 Blah Blah Blah.
  @2
                    "Cool, can you drive it to Wolverhampton."
  @3
                           "WHAT? You must be joking."
  @2
                           "Okay I'll come and get it."
  @3
                                     "COOL."
  @5
  What  I didn't tell him was that before he came round I got the seat covers,
  bulbs,  unused fuses,  stereo and speakers out of it.  I couldn't just  give
  them away could I?

  So  that  was that,  I now have a great steering wheel and two not so  great
  ones  for  sale.  The next step was Alloy wheels.  How does £70  for  5  14"
  Cloverleaves grab you? Not bad eh? I felt different when I had to get  tyres
  for them.#8 "HOW MUCH@5 £170, jees they must be low profile."

                                      "Yup."

                                     "COOL."

  Once the garage had put the tyres on these polished beauties they decided to
  inform me that they couldn't fit them onto my car because I had to buy alloy
  wheel  bolts for them.  I wondered what was wrong with the normal  ones  but
  those  would  have  eaten straight through the alloy  and  left  me  driving
  without  wheels.  So it was search the alloy wheel bolts day.  Went  to  the
  scrappy,  they didn't have any.  Went to the next scrappy,  they didn't have
  any.  Went to MotorWorld but they only had locking bolts.  Drove miles after
  a tip off that WheelMania 2 on the Cov' road sold them.  I finally found the
  place,   parked outside where Lamborghinis,  Ferraris and more exotic  cars.
  Okay here are all these nice cars but where's the bloody entrance.  Try this
  one. @1 RRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNGGGG!!!@5  Oops looks like I've set the  alarm
  off,   time  to depart.  I went back to my car parked across  the  road  and
  descided  to  wait  for the alarm to stop before I tried another  door.   It
  didn't.  Not  until 12 massive blokes in Mercedes turned up and switched the
  damn thing off.  They where HUGE people, they looked like heavies. When they
  left  I  reluctantly  got out  of  my  car and asked the  assistant  in  the
  garage next door where the entrance to it was.  He pointed out a small  hole
  in  the  wall of the place and I headed for it.  When I got in there  I  saw
  exactly  what  I  thought  Ferrari  and  Lamborghini  drivers  looked  like.
  Massive,  hairy,  Italian,  dickheads. @3 "How much are your alloy wheel bolts
  for a Mk3 Escort."@5

                               Tap Tap Tap of keys.
  @4
                        "Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr £4."
  @3
                           "And how many is that for?"
  @4
                        "That's for one" He said frowning.
  @3
                              "One bolt is £4#8 ?!?!"@4

                   "You won't find them anywhere cheaper mate."
  @5
                    I was already on my way out at that point.
  @3
           "Oh someone set your alarm off by the way"@5 I said as I left.

  I  descided  to try straight for the manufacturers in the yellow  pages.   I
  could get them for 69p each in the post.  Which would you prefer to  pay?  I
  almost  ordered  them  but another advert caught my  attention.   It  was  a
  scrapyard but they might just have some.  As it turned out I got them,   all
  16  of them for £10.  It's definitely worth shopping around.  So I took them
  back  to  the  garage where my alloys where waiting for  me.   They  fitted,
  balanced and tracked them and that was that.  I still have those alloys  on,
  it  improves  grip around corners as they are wider wheels  but  since  they
  have  low profile tyres it is a rougher ride over bumps etc,  they  do  look
  the bizz tho'.

  Now  it  was time to go inside the car and onto my favourite thing in  life.
  MUSIC!   I  bought a 300W amp and a 400W 12" sub to go on the MDF  backshelf
  with  2 6X9s already on it and another two mid range speakers to go  in  the
  front.  It took a while to set up and I blew quite a few fuses but the  bass
  was  there  and  that's  what really matters. I had people  dancing  on  the
  street,   I shit you not,  I was driving home from work blaring out  Clarkee
  and  this  guy  waiting to cross the street heard me coming and  started  to
  dance to the music.  I laughed so loud I almost crashed the car. So here was
  my  red  birdmobile  that everyone loved and envied but  the  MOT  date  was
  getting  closer and it was always in the back of my mind.   Don't  worry  it
  only failed on a wiper blade last time it will be fine I thought.
  #8
  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.@5  Was the first thing that came into  my
  head when I was told by a mechanic at Baldwins Lane Service Station that  my
  car had failed it's MOT.  My mood changed somewhat as he started to describe
  what it had failed on.
  @6
  "New  steering  rack,   New right side inner and outer  sill,   new  battery
  holder, new left front suspension turret, tons of welding and emissions"
  @3
                               "Okay. Quote please"
  @6
                       "You want me to print you one out?"
  @3
                                   "Yes please"
  @6
        "Sorry"@5 he said to a person waiting behind me@6 "won't be a moment."
  @5
  5  minutes later I had a quote for £450 worth of repairs in my  hand  and  I
  felt like I had fallen over.
  @6
          "You have 7 days to bring the car back in for it's free MOT."
  @3
                                    "Thanks!"

  Oh my god, @1 £450.@5  That was almost as much as I paid for the car.  That  was
  more than getting the damn Nissan through it's MOT.  I went home and studied
  the  failure  sheet carefully.  I could buy all of these bits  much  cheaper
  through  a different company but there was a load of welding,  more  than  I
  had  suspected.  The thing was it was all under the car and in weird  places
  so of course  I didn't expect there to be a problem as the car looked  brill
  from the outside. I phoned my brother in law for advice.


  @2
                                     "Hiya."
  @3
                           "Yeah it's failed miserably."
  @2
                                    "On what?"
  @3
                            "Everything complicated."
  @2
                              "Did you get a quote?"
  @3
                                      "£450"
  @5
  What followed was a long stream of obscene language possibly directed at the
  person  who owned the garage which failed it.  I used to live  next  to  the
  geezer so I was sure he wouldn't take the piss but it failed never the less.

  My  brother  in law got back to me about half an hour later and  gave  me  a
  number of a garage about 3 miles away which he used to use when he lived  in
  Birmingham 6 years ago.  I gave this person a ring and he told me  to  bring
  the car in,  so I did.  On arrival at the garage I was amazed  at the  state
  of  the place.  I know garages aren't meant to be the tidiest of places  but
  this was a disgrace.  I had to manoeuvre round an oil ridden engine  to  get
  into  the place.  I finally found Pat in the 90°C office at the back of  the
  garage.  After a bit of conversation he told me to go out onto the floor and
  find  someone he described as a big person with a moustache.   I  found  him
  okay,   he  and some other mechanic with no front teeth started kicking  and
  pushing  my  car for some strange reason.  I jacked the bonnet as  requested
  and there was the culprit.  The battery holder was completely rotten and the
  battery itself was rattling around in the space.  Next they found  the  sill
  which was also rotten.  They pulled a bit off that and I knew that the price
  was  adding up.  I drove the car onto a hydraulic ramp and they lifted clean
  into  the air so they could see underneath.  The floor pan was full of holes
  and cracks,  it was downright ugly. They managed to get all 4 wheels off the
  ground  to test the bearings etc.  They checked each wheel one by one  until
  they  got  to  the rear right one.  He spun it round and  it  was  making  a
  scraping noise then he shook it back and forth.@1  THE WHEEL WAS SO  LOOSE  IT
  PRACTICALLY CAME OFF IN HIS HANDS!!!!@5  I couldn't help but laugh.  Even  the
  Baldwins Lane station hadn't spotted this huge defect.  They lowered it back
  onto  the  ground and tested the brakes on a rolling road.  They where  fine
  but  he said I shouldn't be driving on that loose wheel.  Luckily for me  it
  was  an  adjustable bearing and since they weren't that busy he tightened it
  up  free  of charge.  At first they quoted me@1 £400@5,  then when I  told  them
  about Baldwins Lane they said@1 £317@5.  It still wasn't good enough and I  said
  I'd think about it.  When I got home I phoned up and spoke to Pat and said I
  could  only  scrape@1 £250 to £300@5 together.  He pondered this thought  for  a
  moment and thought, might as well.  Well how's that? £450 down to £250,  not
  bad eh? It gets better.  I took the car in on the said date and this time it
  was  BUSY.  It was like a drive-thru  McDonalds.  I dumped the  car  in  the
  first  spot  I  could find and ran through to the office to find  Pat.   Pat
  wasn't  in  there,   there was a young receptionist  who  looked  thoroughly
  stressed out,  people where waving pieces of paper in her face and I  wasn't
  going to make it any better.

            "Hiya, I've got my car booked in for repairs and an MOT."
  @7
              "You must be joking we have absolutely no room today."
  @3
           "I can see that but I booked my car in with Pat 4 days ago."
  @7
                    "Not according to this diary you didn't."
  @5
  I descided to go and speak to Pat who I found trying to sell a piece of shit
  Citreon to someone outside.  Before I could get to him the guy with no front
  teeth jumped out in front of me as though defending his master.
  @2
         "Your not getting your car repaired today!"@5 he said menacingly.
  @3
            "I was told by Pat to bring it in and pick it up tomorrow."
  @2
  "Yeah,  well I'm telling you different,  we've got a million cars to do.  If
  you leave your car we won't even touch it until Saturday."
  @3
                        "So why did he tell me to. . . ."
  @2
                "Pat writes things in his head, not in the book."
  @3
          "Oh I see. So I've completely wasted a day just to hear this."
  @2
                       "Sorry but that's the way it goes."
  @5
  At  that point another young cocky mechanic came up to defend his  toothless
  mate.  I left blaring out the whole garage with Drum and Bass from my stereo
  and smoke from my wheels. What a wanker though!

  When  I  got  home  I phoned up my brother in law and he said  that  he  was
  completely  different when he knew him.  He gave a person in Surrey  a  ring
  who  owned  a garage and explained the situation.  I could get it  done  for
  £200  but I'd have to drive it down to Surrey with no MOT.  Why not.  I  set
  out at 6AM and arrived at my Brother in laws house in Enfield at 8:30AM.   I
  got  them  out of bed.  After I'd got in and relaxed a bit it  was  time  to
  move,  Meadvale awaits us.  After dropping my sis' off at work we flew  down
  the  M25,   through the Dartford tunnel and finally into Meadvale  at  about
  10AM.  We got to a tiny garage on the top of a hill, and I was surprised. It
  really  didn't  look like a garage,  it was really cramped  and  had  a  few
  little  out  buildings.  Rob and Caroline who owned it were really  friendly
  and  were impressed at the Alloy wheels I had put on it.  It was off to work
  they  go.  First they cleaned up the battery tray and pulled the rotton  one
  out.  Upon removal of the battery I saw the carpet inside the car. This rust
  hole  had  the  power leads to my amp running through them so I disconnected
  that and they plugged the hole up by welding bits of metal to it.  It took a
  lot  longer  than  I  thought.  They had to get under  the  wheel  arch  and
  everything.  Meanwhile me and my bro' were relaxing with a pint in the White
  Lion.   After a few games of pool we descided to head back in  the  freezing
  wind  to  see how they were doing.  They had just finished welding  the  new@5
  battery  tray  on  and  were  in the process of removing  the  rotton  sill.
  Sudden panic hit me,  this was a one off paint job which coincidentally they
  did,   how were they going to match the paint? Well it turned out that  they
  painted both of the sills black so it didn't look odd.

  Great,  I thought I might just get home tonight and get the MOT tomorow. Not
  so fast,  disaster struck.  Upon lifting the carpet up inside the car we saw
  a nice gaping hole,  I was surprised that the seat wasn't falling out.  That
  set  us  back  another two days but it was well worth it in the  end.   They
  MOT'd  my  car at a local garage and it passed with flying colours.  Nothing
  wrong  with  the  emmisions or the steering rack so F**K YOU  Baldwins  Lane
  Station.  Well in the end it only cost me £160 and about £50 in petrol so  I
  made  a  huge  saving.  We finally finished the car up at  00:00  on  Sunday
  morning.   I drove the car back to Enfield as everyone else was  pissed.   I
  think they deserved it after all that work.

  Coming back on the M25 at 1AM I thought I might test this baby out.  It took
  a  while  but  I  got  up to a maximum speed of 110 MPH  in  the  fast  lane
  of course.  I  only  slowed down when we got to the Dartford  tunnel.   Upon
  arrival home I tried to figure out how to reconnect the Amp.  In the  end  I
  pulled  the cigar lighter out@1 (I didn't smoke anyway)@5  and tapped the  power
  off  that.   The  only wierd thing was - when I put the lights  on  the  amp
  switched  off.  I still haven't figured it out.  To make my car  even  nicer
  looking with black sills I bought a blue interior lamp.  Unfortunately  that
  stopped  working as well so I had some electrical problems to say the least.
  Was it the Amp,  the stereo or the 7 speakers? Who knows,  at least I had an
  MOT.

  I'm very sorry to say that I have driven while over the limit once. It was a
  night I split up with my girlfriend so I wasn't in the mood for reconing.  I
  knew  it was wrong and when I started the engine it felt alien to be in  the
  car.  Luckily I got home in one piece,  I don't recommend anyone try it. But
  for  anyone  who  takes drugs,  remember that illegal  drugs  can  have  bad
  affects on your driving aswell.

  Well  there  you have it.  That was my first car and it still is  because  I
  have  no intention of getting rid of it yet.  I just hope it does better  on
  it's  next MOT.  As far as general driving goes,  I have had plenty of  near
  misses.  People pulling out on you at the last second,  cutting you up, it's
  scary  if you  lock your brakes up in the wet,  but luckily  I  haven't  hit
  anyone or anything.
