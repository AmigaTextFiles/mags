@2 So,  with the info above,  you all know most of the important stuff about
me except for the size of my todger and my inside leg measurement,  but I`ll
tell you both of those in a later issue.
@2
Now,  I think that I`ve done one of these in the past, but if not,here`s all
the  smut and gunge of the man who was once labelled as the man who was once
going  to play the part of the "Man From Delmonte",  but I wasn`t given  the
part  because I would say "Yes",  even after I was offered some  hooky  PC`s
from a man in a pub, so my claim to fame was a very brief one.
@2
Anyway, enough of this crap, hands up who wants to know more about me (hmmm,
1,  2,  de de dum dum,  oh come on,  there`s gotta be bloody more than 3  of
you, and two of those are coppers, oh well, here goes.
 @2
So, where was I born (answers on a postcode to The Ripper, Dungeon Master or
Ferret please don't reply).

@2  Right,  Original town/country of birth was Manchester/England,  I was  1
year old when I came to Leamington Spa/Warwickshire,  and boy oh boy, did my
little feet hurt after walking all those bloody miles,  and you should  have
seen the state of my all-in-one romper suit, it was so shitty.



@3
Anyway,   as  usual,  I digress from my deed at hand,  so,  I  was  born  in
Manchester,  I came to Leamington when I was about a year old,  and had  the
normal  adolescent upbringing of a child born into the 60`s which  consisted
of sex booze drugs and Rock `n` Roll,  and dirty women with the emphasis not
so  much  on the drugs and dirty women (shame though),  and it wasn`t  until
the late 70`s that I became involved with any computers whatsoever,  and  it
wasn`t until I met my first wife that i really got into the computer  scene,
and the computer in question was a mere ZX81 with a whole 1Mb of memory,  it
was  my  mates computer,  and after a few months of using that at his  house
over  in Redditch he bought a 16K Ram Pack,  which for all the speccy owners
is  there worse nightmare,  because after typing a lot of text out in  order
to be able to even play a game,  the slightest knock on the ZX81 would cause
"#2RamPack Wobble@3".



@3
RamPack  Wobble basically cleared your ZX81 of any data that was present  at
the  time  of the "Crash",  resulting in literally hours of typing  in  code
which ended up lost, mega stress, you bet.


@3  Then  after  a  few months during another visit to  my  mates  place  in
Redditch,   another  of his mates had one of the first  Spectrums  with  the
bloody  horrible  rubber keypads,  shit was my fingers  getting  sore  after
trying  to  get into the extended modes etc,  then came Sir Clive Sinclair`s
step  into  serious computing with the development and selling of  a  proper
computer in the shape of the Spectrum 48K+,  which gave you a proper  QWERTY
hard  plastic keyboard,  and a whopping 48K of onboard memory,  this  was  a
heavenly computer to use at the time,  other users were on other formats  of
computers,  such as the commodore 64k,  which in it`s own right was as  good
if not better than the speccy.
@3
I  think that in selling terms,  the Commodore 64k was by far a more popular
selling  machine,   anyway,  the oncoming months saw  me  upgrade  from  the
Spectrum  48k+,  to a Spectrum 128k,  then a Spectrum +2,  and finally  with
Alan  Sugar being in the driving seat at Sinclair developments,   the  final
Spectrum to be brought out was the Spectrum +3,  the speccy 128 had a  whole
128k  of  memory,  the +2 had the same memory plus an data cassette recorder
built  into  the computer,  the +3 also had 128k of memory,   but  the  crap
cassette  recorder  was replaced by the first and very expensive  3"  floppy
disk  drive with floppy disk`s costing around the £2 or more each,  shit  to
that we all said.



@3
I then switched formats and went over to the Amstrad 64k range of computers,
bloody waste of time as well,  but the good thing about this move was in the
contact  of  Ray Hawkins who was the editor for an Amstrad-based  newsletter
called  "2#Amscircle@3",  I joined up with Ray to get  this  newsletter  put
together  each  issue,  buy which time I had added a  new  ROM  chip  to  my
Amstrad  64k  computer plus an extra 64k memory module to give  me  a  whole
128k Amstrad, still a bloody crap machine though.
@4
Then  the oncoming months saw Ray change to the Amiga scene,  so due to  the
fact  we have both struck up a very good friendship I also move over to  the
Amiga scene although I was in two minds weather to go to the Atari ST,   but
the  Amiga`s great capabilities made my mind up for me,  my Amiga route took
me via the A500,  A500+ and finally the brilliant A1200,  I stayed clear  of
the  crappy A600 which as I`ve heard from in the past was good hindsight  on
my part.


@4
           My system used up to about 2 weeks ago consisted of an:-






@5  EZ-Plus Eyetech Towered A1200.
    An `030 Blizzard accelerator board with 32Mb of FastRam and 50 Mhz FPU.
    A Blizzard SCSI MK IV Kit on the accelerator
    A Seagate Medallist ST34321A 3.5" 4.4Gb hard drive.
    A 40-Speed EIDE CD ROM Drive.
    1 floppy drive in the tower as well as the normal DF0:.
    An Epson Stylus 600 Inkjet Printer. (Deceased some time ago)
    A Star LC-10 colour 9-pin dot matrix printer (Temporary I hope).
    A Philips 14" CM8833/II stereo colour monitor.
    A pair of 300 Watt Multimedia PC/Amiga stereo Speakers.

@6
And  that`s how my system look about two weeks ago,  but,  like all  things,
nothing last`s forever,  well,  neither my printer nor my monitor  has,   my
printer went AWOL last Sunday and refused to print,  even with new  ink  and
cartridges,  plus it grinded badly upon switch-on,  then Monday,  my monitor
was  starting to play up with the picture flickering as though  the  monitor
was  about  to die on me plus the picture has now decided to play  hide  and
seek  with  me  from time to time by very randomly fading into a  completely
blank  screen and re-appearing whenever I least expect it,  so by  the  time
you read this article,  my system will almost be identical to above with the
exception of:-

@6
A second-hand Philips CM8833-MkII stereo colour monitor, with manual and all
leads (even the Amiga-to-Philips lead) and the whole package is being bought
from the nice bloke Andy from #4S.H.A.C@6 for only £79 INCLUSIVE of p&p plus
transit insurance, which I reckon is a bloody good deal, don`t you.

@6
And  a replacement printer has had to be (due to lack of funds)  a Star LC10
Colour 9-pin Dot Matrix,  but as soon as my cash situation picks up  then  a
better Epson Stylus Inkjet printer will almost for sure be the order of  the
day,  quite possibly a 750 or 760 model,  but who knows, anyway, the printer
with  p&p is only costing me £30 inclusive of p&p thanks to a new  but  good
contact of mine called Peter Selmes (or Snoopy as he`s known),  cheers mate,
I owe you one.

@6
And  recently  after the Blizzard SCSI MKIV kit that  I  had  fitted  to  my
accelerator board packed up on me, I`ve managed to get a replacement free of
charge from the nice people at Power computing, moreso with the help of Tony
Larini,   cheers Toni,  or is it Tony,  anyway,  now with the SCSI  kit  re-
installed  and the 16Mb of 72-pin EDO memory simm fitted to the SCSI  board,
I`ve not got my old 48Mb A1200 back to how it was, great.
@7
So,  at present (until I decide to change the look of my WB yet again),  so,
with  my WB under the full control of DOpus Magellan,  and stacks of patches
running such as Arg,  StackAttack,  NewIcons,  TolleUHR to name  but  a  few
which  can  be found either on most of the AFCD`s/AACD`s or on  any  of  the
Aminet CD`s or the Aminet via a modem.
@7
I  will  be  getting the full OS 3.5 upgrade some very soon,  plus hopefully
sometime  this  year I`m going to try to afford to buy a Cybervision  64  3D
graphics card and a Z4 board,  and a good possibility I`ll also get a an IDE
CDRW,  a new 17" SVGA monitor would be nice,  but I reckon that I`ll have to
make-do  with the Philips CM8833 MkII one that I`ll hopefully have  by  next
week.
@7
Right,  that's enough said about my system and hardware,  it`s time to  tell
you  what software (Games/Utilities)  I like using or playing with,  on  the
games side I love playing Slamtilt,  Deluxe Galaga V6c, any or most types of
shoot- em-ups,  some puzzle type games such as the Valhalla series,   but  I
haven't ever managed to complete any of them yet, Gloom Deluxe and Testament
are  pretty  good,  on the Utilities I love messing with and tweaking  DOpus
Magellan, and each time there always seems to be a couple of things that are
new to me, it`s a very full and comprehensive replacement for WB, it does so
much,  and although it has been said to me many many times before about what
a "#2Memory-Hungry@1" package it is, I don`t think so, I took it off my WB a
week  or  so ago just to see the difference in both memory and usability  it
makes,   bloody hell,  I was lost without it,  and as far as  memory  hungry
goes,  yes,  like most utilities it does take a bit of memory,  about 1Mb to
run  it,  but that`s memory from your FastRam,  but with 48Mb of it I`ve  no
worries, and for what it does, I`ll gladly sacrifice 1Mb or thereabouts.
@7
Anyway,  if any of you who don't know me or have never contacted me wish  to
do  so,  then either give me a bell on my above number,  or drop  me  a  few
lines  at my above address,  That's it,  hope you find "My Profile" of  some
interest,  so till my next article,  take care,  and please,  try to support
our  diskmag The Ripper,  with your help it'll survive longer,  without your
help,   it'll  die,  do you want that to happen,  we  need  all  the  input,
contacts and fun at the present time on the Amiga the way that the scene  is
at present.
@2
         Catch U L8tr, ok...............cheers.....(Steve/Dr Jekyll).
