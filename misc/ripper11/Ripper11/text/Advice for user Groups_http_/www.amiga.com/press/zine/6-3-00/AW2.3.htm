       Making User Groups Work*2@1
       =======================
@5
When  Bill McEwen acquired Amiga  from
Gateway last year,  he cited his  main
reason  for  doing so  was  the  Amiga
community.   However,  that  community
would  be  far  less  valuable  if  it
weren't for the efforts of user groups
throughout the world.  These worldwide
user  groups accomplished great things
over  the last few years,  and  are  a
big reason the Amiga continues to this
day.
@5
While  Amiga  user group numbers  have
fallen,  it doesn't mean that the user
group  experience has faltered.   Some
of  the  ingenious things  Amiga  user
groups  have  done have  enhanced  the
Amiga  experience into  a  tight  knit






community.  User groups filled in  the
gaps left behind by the mainstream  PC
community.  For example@1:@5 Gateway Amiga
sponsors an annual Amiga show  in  St.
Louis.   Amiga Atlanta  is  noted  for
their  charity work with  the  Special
Olympics.    SEAL   of   the  UK  puts
together a very nice magazine,  as  do
the  French groups AFLE and TRIPLE  A.
NCAUG has sponsored the blimp-cam  and
IRC    show   coverage.     And    the
international   virtual   group   Team
AMIGA  is a veritable customer support
group.   No  other platform  has  user
groups  so involved and so responsible
for    maintaining     a    platform's
viability.

 
@5
So  what  does it take  to  make  your
user  group  an enjoyable  experience?
Not much actually.  It just takes some
smart planning and organization to get
things going.  You'll find that  there
are many folks eager to see the latest
software  and   hardware,   get  their
questions  answered,    or  shoot  the
breeze  with like-minded people.   The
good  news is that you don't  have  to
go  it  alone either.  There are  many
companies,  resources,  and other user
groups  just waiting to lend a helping
hand,   but  first   let's  cover  the
formalities.

 
@5
Amiga  user groups vary  in  size  and
organization.   Some  of  the  smaller
groups  have10 or fewer members  while
some    of    the     larger    groups
@3(particularly those in  Europe)@5   have
hundreds of members.  Some user groups
have  no  formal   charters  in  place
while  others  have achieved  official
not-for-profit   status   with   their
local governments.  

After  your group has decided  whether
to incorporate or not, and has elected
or   appointed   some   key   officers
@3(President,  Treasurer, etc.)@5 you will
need  to find a place to meet  and  to
get  the  word out.  If your group  is
small,   then any member's  home  will
suffice for a meeting place.  This can
be  a nice arrangement.  Not only will
you  have  access   to  an  Amiga  for
meeting topics,  you won't have to use
the  group's  funds to  rent  a  room.
There  should  be   various  community
centers,  schools, libraries, offices,
and  universities that have  rooms  to
offer for free or for a small fee.



@5
Getting  the word out about  your  new
user  group shouldn't be hard in  this
day of the Internet.  Setting up a web
page  and registering it with some  of
the many Internet search engines is  a
big  plus.   Posting announcements  to
Amiga   forums   and   newsgroups   is
another good way to get the word  out.
Many  localities  have  free  computer
publications   like   'Computer  User'
that  list  groups in their  area  for
free.   Lastly,  many cable  companies
and  radio  stations  offer  free  air
time  that  you can take advantage  of
to promote your non-commercial group.

@5 

With  your user group all set  up  and
ready  to  go,  your next task  is  to
consider   the   meeting   topics  and
activities your group will  undertake.
Not  every   meeting   has  to  be  an
elaborate multimedia event,  but  some
good  planning can make for  a  better
experience for all.

 

While  hardware and software offerings
for  the classic Amiga are a bit  thin
right  now,   there   are  still  many
releases @3 (commercial  and  shareware)
@5that  users  would  be  interested  in
seeing  demonstrated   at  a  meeting.
Naturally,   when  the  new  Amiga  is
released,  there will be a great  deal
of  attention placed on new  products.
Another  important area for the  Amiga
is  networking.  Showing how  you  can
network  your Amiga to  PCs  and  Macs
and  other  cross platform topics  can
help  folks find value in using  their
Amigas.    Presenting   tutorials   of
application       software,       like
@3Pagestream,    ImageFX,     Wordworth,
Imagine,  Tornado,  etc.,@5  or  showing
hands-on how to install a graphic card
or  other hardware will certainly keep
members   interested.    Of    course,
playing  the  latest game  release  is
always a good choice for a user  group
meeting.

 
@5
Occasional special meetings  can  also
help  keep  up  morale and attendance.
Annual  swap meets and cookouts  break
up the normal routine.  Swap meets can
help  you  drum up some cash  as  well
and lessen the clutter in your closet,
and  cookouts   are   always  a  crowd
pleaser.   For example,  once  a  year
members of the National Capital  Amiga
Users  group drive up to Software  Hut
in  Philadelphia and  have  a  day  of
food,   fun,   and special  discounts.
Many  Amiga  dealers   are  more  than
happy  to  participate in these  types
of  user  group  events.   Anyone  who
knows  Lamar Alexander and  the  Amiga
Atlanta  user  group  understands  the
great   work   they   have   done   in
supporting the Special Olympics.  When
IBM  dropped  their   support  of  the
Special Olympics,  Mr.  Alexander  saw
an   opportunity   to   increase   the
Amiga's  exposure for  a  good  cause.
Because  of Mr.  Alexander's  efforts,
Amiga  is  now the exclusive  platform
of the Atlanta Special Olympics.  This
is  something most user  groups  could
accomplish.  Mr. Alexander invites all
Amiga user groups to see how they  can
participate     with    their    local
organizer.  If interested, please call
Norm  Sterling of the Special Olympics
at 770-414-9390 ext.  102 and tell him
Lamar Alexander sent you.

@5 

But  it  doesn't  end there.   Through
Amiga   Atlanta's   hard   work    and
involvement with the Special  Olympics
Amiga Sprint will now offer all  Amiga
groups  in  the US fee-free  usage  of
their     special     long    distance
conferencing  accounts.   Lamar  hopes
that  one  day a group of  Amiga  user
groups  link  up  in a  large  meeting
using  this  special  account.   Those
interested   should   contact    Lamar
Alexander  at@1 770-209-4011@5  or  go  to
the    Amiga   Atlanta   website    at
@1http://www.amigaatlanta.org/.

@5 

With  the  new Amigas to arrive  soon,
now  is  the time to start planning  a
new  user  group  or to  gear-up  your
current  user   group   for  the  next
generation.   Until then,   there  are
many  things you can do  to  keep  the
fire  going  at  your  user  meetings.
Whether your group joins in  a  picnic
chatting  about Amigas,   reviews  the
latest software,  or participates in a
local charity event,  your user  group
experience can still be enjoyable.

 

No  matter what size user group you're
working  with,  the  first  place  you
should  visit  to get  information  on
how  to  operate a user group  is  the
User    Group   Network,     or    UGN
@1(http://ugn.amiga.org/)@5.    The    UGN
provides  vital  information  for  all
Amiga user groups.  A search from  the
homepage @1(http://amiga.org/)@5  for user
groups  you  will   yield  a  complete
listing    of   Amiga   user    groups
worldwide.  In addition to  the  great
info on user groups,  you will find  a
wealth  of Amiga knowledge and support
from the Amiga.org website.

@5 

If  you  would like Amiga to advertise
in  your  group's newsletter,   or  to
sponsor  a local sports team,  contact
Kari  at mailto@1:kari@amiga.com.@5  Amiga
would  also  like to hear  suggestions
or    comments   about   user    group
activities  and  events  at  the  same
address.
