      @2{THE RIPPER TO HARD DRIVE
      @4}By The Dungeon Master

      
@5      
         I  don't  know  about  you, but I do @2HATE@5 having to load programs
      from  floppy  disk.   Compared  to  loading  from  CD or hard drive,
      loading  from  floppy seems to take for ever.  The good news is that
      it need not have to be so, for if you can load or run a program from
      workbench  then the chances are that you can install it to your hard
      drive and load and run with the speed of light.  Well maybe not that
      fast, but much faster than you can from floppy disk.
      
         The  @2RIPPER@5 is no exception to the rule.  The @3D@4M@6C@5 disk version is
      a  joy  to read and view and I do enjoy the music that multitasks in
      the background, but it's so SLOW booting from floppy disk!  So let's
      put  it  onto hard drive.  I know that this has been covered in past
      issues  of  the @2 RIPPER@5,  but  my  method  is NEW, EASY, FAST and is
      PROFESSIONAL.
      
         Before  I  start  there are a couple of items that you will need.
      They are:-
      
              An Amiga with a hard drive would be handy!
              A text editor such as GoldEd or CygnusEd.
              A disk manager program like SID or Directory Opus.
              You also need a basic knowledge of your Amiga.
      
         Also  double  check that you have two little programs in your "C"
      directory  called;  IconX  and Assign.  These programs come with all
      versions of workbench and should be there, unless of course you have
      accidentally deleted them!
      
         For the purpose of this tutorial we will install the @2RIPPER@5 disks
      on  to  partition  DH1:   of  our hard drive and we will install the
      @2RIPPER@5  issue  8.  You can of course install the disks to where ever
      you want to on your hard drive.
      
      @4
                               LET'S GET STARTED
      @5
         The  first thing to do is to create a new drawer/directory called
      "Diskmags"  and  in this directory create another drawer and name it
      "Ripper8".  That's the first stage out of the way.
      
         Next  we will copy using our disk manager program following files
      into the newly created Ripper8 drawer:-
      
         From  the  boot  disk  (RIPPER-8)  we ONLY want to copy Articles,
      DATA,  Mods,  CLICK_ME and  DMC.Config, but not any icons.  From the
      second  disk  (RIPPER8-2) we again only want the drawer on it called
      articles, but we have a problem here as there is already a drawer of
      the  same  name  on  disk 1 and copying this second drawer over will
      overwrite  the  first one.  However there is an easy way around this
      minor problem.
      @5
         Again  using  our  disk  manager program open up the first drawer
      named  Articles  and  then  open up the second drawer named articles
      (Note the slight difference in the spelling) and copy the files from
      the articles drawer into the Articles drawer.  You should now end up
      with  a  single  drawer named Articles containing ALL the files from
      both drawers. Is that all clear?
      
         So, we now have the following files in our "Ripper8" drawer:-
      
                Articles
                DATA
                Mods
                CLICK_ME (This is DMC.EXE renamed)
                DMC.Config
      @5
         What  about  all  the  other files on the first disk I can almost
      hear  you  ask?   Well,  we don't need them, it's as simple as that!
      Think   about   it?   We  don't  need  the  "S"  directory  and  its
      startup-sequence  as we are now going to run from hard drive and not
      floppy  disk.   We  don't need the "C" directory as the files within
      should  already  be  in  your  hard drive's "C" directory.  The same
      applies  to  Devs,  L  and  Libs,  the  contents  should be in their
      respective  directories  on your hard drive.  If not, copy them over
      but  be  VERY  careful  that  you  don't  delete  and  install older
      versions.   We  don't  want the Prefs directory either.  This is for
      the  printer  prefs. Your hard drive and workbench should already be
      set  up  with  the  correct preferences for your particular printer!
      And  we don't want any icons either because we are soon going to use
      the little program IconX to do all the work.
      
         Now  we  come  to the "fun" bit.  Choose a nice looking icon that
      you  want  to  represent @2 "The  Ripper"@5,  or  draw or make your own.
      However  it @2 MUST@5  be  a  Project Icon and it must be named slightly
      different  to  the main drawer.  Let's call the icon "Ripper_8.  Use
      workbench's Icon Edit Tool to do the job for you.  Having created or
      found  an  icon  we  now  need  to add a tooltype to it.  Using Icon
      Information  from  workbench  type  in IconX as the Default Tool and
      save.  Now copy the icon to our "Ripper_8" drawer.
      
         So, what's in the drawer now?
      
                Articles
                DATA
                Mods
                CLICK_ME (This is DMC.EXE renamed)
                DMC.Config
                Ripper_8.info
      
         Is  it  all looking  good?  Now  we  need to make the all singing
      and  all  dancing  IconX  script to make it all work.  Let's boot up
      an ASCII text editor such as CygnusEd and type in@2 EXACTLY:-@5
      
      ;Set up assignments
      Assign env: ram:
      Assign "RIPPER-8: "DH1:Diskmags/Ripper8
      Assign "RIPPER8-2: "DH1:Diskmags/Ripper8
      CLICK_ME
      
      ;Remove  assignments  upon  quitting  back  to WB
      Assign "RIPPER-8:" DISMOUNT
      Assign "RIPPER8-2:" DISMOUNT
      
         Save this ASCII file as Ripper_8 and the job is done.
      
         So we now have in our drawer the following files:-
      
                Articles
                DATA
                Mods
                CLICK_ME (This is DMC.EXE renamed)
                DMC.Config
                Ripper_8
                Ripper_8.info
      @5
         That's all we need.
      
         So  how  does  it  work?  Very simple, when you open the Diskmags
      drawer  and  in  turn  the@2 Ripper8@5 drawer you will be presented with
      that  nice  icon  you chose.  Double click it @2"The Ripper"@5 will run.
      How?   Well  clicking  that  project icon will activate the tooltype
      called  IconX  which  will  in  turn  execute  the script we created
      earlier.
      
         Now  we  come  to  the clever bit.  On quitting @2"The Ripper"@5, @2D@3M@4C@5
      will  return  control  to  workbench and the remainder of our script
      will  be  executed.   The assigns will be removed and full return to
      workbench is made.  Don't forget that every time an assign is made a
      few  precious  bytes  of  your  2  megs  of CHIP memory is eaten up,
      removing the assign returns that memory.
      
         I  feel  that this new method is a vast improvement over previous
      methods  as  there is no need to have to open a SHELL or CLI window.
      There  is  no  need to have to type anything in to run the magazine.
      There  is  a  nice  icon  for each or your disk magazines albeit@2 THE
      CRYPT@5  or @2 "The Ripper"@5.  There is no loss of memory and finally you
      don't  have  loads of assign statements filling up your hard drive's
      "S" directory.  It's also @2VERY, VERY@5 fast.  Try it out for your self
      folks?
      
         Hoping  that  this  text  file is left un-crunched for you I have
      included  #5ALL@5  the  IconX  scripts that you will need to run all the
      issues  of  the @2 RIPPER@5  from hard drive.  Either load this tutorial
      into  a text editor and "Cut and Paste" the scripts from it or print
      it out and type them in.  Have fun.
