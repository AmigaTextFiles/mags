My local Newspaper,  The Evening Mail,
is  currently holding  a  campaign  to
try and cut down the use and abuse  of
Ecstasy or@3 MDMA@5,  whatever you want to
call it.

This campaign has been started by  the
fact that within the past few months a
number  of  young and  older  clubbers
have  died after using the drug.   And
that's in the West Midlands alone.

It's  an  awful   tradegy  that  these
innocent people have died through  the
hands  of  drugs but is the  govenment
@2REALLY@5  doing  enough  to  stop  these
deaths? Please remember,  this is only
my  personal opinion and not  that  of
The@2 Ripper@5 diskmag as a whole.  If you
disagree with what I have  to  say  or




would  like to tell us your  views  or
accounts  of  drug usage  then  please
write in.
@5
The  fact  remains   that  around  one
million people in the@1 UK@5 take Ecstacy,
@1EVERY@5 weekend.  Remember,  that's  one
million @1 PEOPLE@5,  not@1 TABLETS@5  so  the
real number could be double that!

It's  all  very  well   putting  scare
stories and the like on the TV and  in
the  papers,  which I must  add  isn't
the  case   in   all   situations  i'm
pleased to say.  But the fact  remains
that  people will try it.  That  could
be  your   Brother,    Sister,    Son,
Daughter, Friend, Foe@1.......@5 Anyone!

It's  all  very well putting headlines
like@3 "KILLER DRUG"@5 and such like,  and
having   articles   saying   that @1YOU@5
should@1 NOT@5 take@1 E,  it WILL kill  you!
@5Telling someone over and over  not  to
do  something is only  going  to  make
their  curiosity  stronger,   wouldn't
you agree?

I'm  sure the people who took  Ecstacy
at  these  nightclubs knew  they  were
breaking the law of the country,   but
were  they  taking as much  care  with
their   body?   Had   they   made  the
preperations? Had@1 THEY@5  been  educated
in  the  dangers and pitfalls  of  the
drug? Have#8 YOU@5?

It's  all  very  well you  sitting  at
home  and having total disrespect  for
people  who  use drugs when  you  know
nothing about drugs yourself. @4 "I'm no
Pharmacist"@5 I hear you say!  But, have
you  took the time to do research into
drugs,   have they ever  crossed  your
mind?

Thank  god for organisations like  the
National Drugs Helpline which  provide
people with real information  on@1  MDMA
@5rather than the press which just knock
it for what it is.

Think  about   this   for   a  moment.
Imagine a person who's been  going  to
clubs  since their teens and has  been
taking Ecstacy for many years.   He  /
She  gets  supplied the  drug  from  a
reliable  source   (@3Not  an unknown@5),
they  drink  plenty  of  water,   take
plenty of breaks from dancing,   don't
take  it every weekend and have  never
had  a  bad  experience from  it  ever
since they've been taking it.  Do  you
think  that  person is  likely  to  be
affected    by   scare   stories    in
newspapers?  Do you think  it's  going
to  stop them taking it the next  time
they  go  out? I don't think so!   But
what if,  after all the reading up and
talking  about  it  with  friends  and
helplines,   they  were  still  a  bit
dubious  on  the drug and didn't  know
whether it was entirely safe.   Should
the  help  be there for  them  to  see
what  they  were actually taking?  Of-
Course it should,  this person has the
same  rights as someone who has  never
taken  it.   What i'm  getting  at  is
this,   there  is not @1 ONE@5  agency  in
Britain  that you can take an  Ecstacy
pill  to  and have them  test  it  for
it's  ingredients!  This is  basically
the  govenment saying,  we'll keep  as
many  people off the drug as  we  can,
but  for  the people who have  already
started - F**K YOU!  Were not going to
help you!...  Do you think this is  at
all fair?

How  many  testing   agencies  do  you
think the government could start  with
the  profit  they make  on  Cigerettes
and  Alcohol each year? Both of  which
are  addictive   drugs   by  the  way!
Nicotine and Alcohol account for  more
deaths,  fights, family violence, loss
of  jobs and downright stinking smelly
bastardness than I care to imagine.
@5
I've  been informed that you  can  buy
@1MDMA@5 testing kits over the internet. A
fairly simple matter of scraping  part
of the tablet into a saucer of special
liquid  that changes colour  depending
on  the ingredients.  I have not  seen
these  yet,   have you any information
on these kits? Would you prefer to use
one  of these kits or get proffesional
people to do it?

Ecstacy is not an addictive drug,   it
does no lasting harm to you but it  IS
illegal so the people who take it  are
slated  as criminals to be  looked  on
with disgust by the government.

By the way,  did you know that @1MDMA @5is
in  the  same category as  Heroin  and
Cocaine?  Did   you   know  that @1 MDMA
@5actually  triggers a natural  reaction
in  your brain,  not some brainwashing
chemical  reaction that you  may  have
been led to believe!

I  could  go  on,  but I want #8 YOU@5  to
respond  to  the  magazine  with @3 YOUR
@5point of view on this matter.  Go  and
do  your research,  find out the truth
about  the  drug and the  people  that
take  it,  if you take drugs,  Illegal
ones or otherwise,  then write in  and
tell  us  your experiences  with  drug
use.   This  is an issue that  effects
every  single one of us,  like  it  or
not!
