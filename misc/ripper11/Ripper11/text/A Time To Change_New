Hiya Folks,  it's Dr Jekyll here,  I don't know about you, but for me trying
to  work  out  what to write about for every article so as to make  it  both
different and enjoyable is bloody difficult,  ok, so most of us can just sit
down,  boot up our miggys and with a word processor or text editor  knock  a
few  pages  of text out on complete waffle,  well I do most of the  time  so
what's new I ask myself.

So,  I was trying to think of what to write about for this article,  and not
being  much  of  a  gamer  so  typing  out  a  stack  of  back-door  cheats,
walkthroughs  etc was out of the question,  and using such a  versatile  and
powerful  machine as the A1200 doing a review on new games was also  not  on
my agenda,  no,  me,  I'm a utility man myself, I love using most utilities,
just  so  I can see the power of our still great machine,  and although  the
miggy  A1200 itself hasn't really changed much from the first  day  of  it's
creation,  the serious add-ons in both software and hardware have  made  the
miggy  from what was once labelled as a "Toy",  to what I think  is  in  the
same street as the "Horrid" PC,  ok,  so we all slag-off the PC, but we must
get  our facts right,  the PC is more of a machine than the miggy will  ever
be,   no,   I'm not a traitor,  I'm a realist,  the PC is one  mother  of  a
machine,  it's only Windows and the name of "Bill Gates" that all or most of
us hate.

The  only  thing  that  I found that made the PC such a  bastard  unfriendly
machine  was  the  fact that every hardware device HAD to  have  it's  EXACT
driver,  even the bloody joystick had to be first calibrated before it could
work,  yep,  but that's all down to the instability of Windows,  the PC  and
windows is not su much a computer for people to enjoy to use,  it's more  of
a guaranteed multi- million dollar money maker for dear Mr Gates,  god bless
the little shit.

Being a PC user some time ago for a short while I realised that not only was
it a powerful machine,  but very user-friendly when joined with Windows, and
up  till  about  5  years ago I reckon our Amiga was  never  likely  to  get
anywhere  near  it as far as power was concerned,  but recently  with  great
support  for  firms such as Eyetech who unlike others,  has stuck  with  the
miggy through thick and thin and still offer a bloody good service (no,  I'm
not getting a percentage from them for creeping,  so there)  Eyetech and the
like  such as Blittersoft have made the miggy into a computer that was  born
yesterday but will carry on for many tomorrows I reckon,  and with the  fact
that  I've  got  about  50 Amiga contacts who have seen  our  beloved  miggy
thrown  to  the wolves by our own creators in the shape of Commodore,   then
Escom  and  more recently Gateway 2000 the more determined Amiga users  like
Blittersoft and Eyetech have stayed with us and have seen the  light  so  to
speak  for  our  machine in the shape of a new owner  company  run  by  true
supporters of the computer,  so,  have Fleecy Moss (I love that  name)   and
Bill McEwan saved us,  I think that our future is starting to look the  best
that it has done for years.
@4
But  we must all remember that the "Rebirth" of the Amiga isn't all down  to
software  and  hardware companies and our new owners,  our rebirth  is  also
down to us lads,  what I'm trying to say is this, there's a small faction in
the  miggy  society who are determined to stay with the "Old" miggy  layout,
you  know,  an A1200,  small hard drive,  floppy drives and the basic  stuff
that we all had on a Amigas years ago,  those systems I'm sorry to say in my
opinion  are  "Dinosaurs",  and like their namesakes will eventually  become
extinct.

So, what have I've found happens to many of my old Amiga contacts as soon as
the  going gets tough is to desert their machines and go over to the PC only
to  phone me up some time later to winge on about how unstable the PC is and
how in some ways they wish they had still kept their miggys,  the fools, the
rest  of  us  know  only too well just the sort of shit and uncertain  times
we've been through in the past with the Amiga,  but most of us have hung  on
in there and now I think that a new-age for our beloved friendly machine  is
upon us,  I know for sure that if the great computer powers to be could come
up  with a new PC style computer that user a sort of AmigaDOS plus  some  of
the  Amigas  good points then I for one would change tomorrow,   but  that's
almost  impossible,   so,   what do we all do to  ascertain  our  individual
futures  on  our  miggys,  we need to push the picture of  the  "Old  Style"
Amigas  into  the  back of our minds and giveway to a new  breed  of  Amiga,
especially the ever-so-popular A1200 which I think that most of us  own  and
use.
@5
Yes,  it's "Time For A Change",  we all need to change,  or rather adapt  in
order  to keep in touch with the computer world as a whole,  up till  a  few
years ago,  I think that we in the Amiga world were a separate part  of  the
computing world,  we're not, we're part of it, as soon as you use a computer
of whatever format your a computer user,  there's no two ways about it, what
we've all tried to do in the past was to build an imaginary wall around  our
Amiga  society,  which was ok in those times,  there were the groups  of  PC
users,  Amiga users,  etc etc, we were all separate, but in the past 5 years
or  so,   we all have unintentionally joined in some ways to the  PC  world,
most  of  us  use big 3.5" hard drives,  these big fast beast's  were  never
meant for the miggy,  they are basically PC (not windows)  orientated,   Zip
drives,  flatbed scanners,  SVGA monitors, Towercases, none Amiga keyboards,
modems,  and I could go on but I won't,  you get the idea,  all these are PC
orientated,   we can't deny it,  so,  although most of us hate  the  letters
"PC",   most  of us have certain aspects of that particular  format  on  our
modern day Amiga's,  and would we get rid of them just so we could say we've
still got a fully fledged miggy, I for one definitely wouldn't.

With the creation of the new Z4 boards, the Amijoe G3 accelerator boards, we
aren't so much losing the Amiga identity,  but moreso keeping the Amiga name
going strong,  although our respective machines are getting fast, processing
data faster and better,  doing more that just playing games,  the Amiga name
is  still there,  and as far as I know,  that's what most if not all  of  us
want  and  are  intent on doing,  keeping the name Amiga going  is  the  key
factor  for  most of us I think,  but in what shape or form  doesn't  really
matter,   just so long as at the heart of our systems is the Amiga,   not  a
Pentium  III  or an AMD or Celleron,  but the Gayle,  Paula  Gary's  of  our
machines,  if we change our views on how we upgrade our miggy's we'll  still
be around for many years I reckon,  stay with the concept of the old miggy's
and our machines end up like the dinosaurs "Extinct".
@6
So,  if you, yes YOU, are one of those amongst us who hate change especially
to your miggy then piss of from our scene and go over to the PC,  they never
change,  they started crap and they're still crap,  I know,  I've owned  and
used  one,  well it's Windows really that drag the PC down,  anyway,  that's
another matter.

Now,  just think of your modern-day miggy like a new car of today,  the  new
cars  are  partly  run  by  some  sort  of computer  circuitry  for  various
functions,  and all this has to finely tuned,  modern-miggy systems  are  no
different  (well,   apart from there's steering wheel or petrol/diesel  tank
etc  etc)  but you get my jest,  unlike the old Amigas that we  all  had  at
first where most of the time the few upgrades that were around for us  would
99.999% work most of the time,  with such modern add-ons as 3.5" hard  drive
of 4.2Gb and over and the rest of the modern upgrades,  incomputability has,
like  the  PC come to us Amiga users,  moreso with the actual Amiga computer
itself  than the new upgrades,  old A1200's for instance as far  as  I  know
(but  I'm prepared to be told otherwise by any of you techy chaps out there)
old  A1200's were only really designed to be used with the small  slow  2.5"
hard  drives of small storage capacities,  larger hard drives could be used,
but  only  by way of the more expensive SCSI format via a Squirrel interface
connected to the A1200's side PCMCIA port,  but moreso recently the big 3.5"
PC beast's of more than 4.2Gb (gigabyte)  have played a dominant role in the
Amiga's  progression,  most of us have got pissed off with loading  software
from  the slow low capacity floppy disk,  and have moved up and over to  big
3.52 hard drives and in some cases,  Zip drives and CD ROM drives,  and in a
few cases, CD ROM read/writers which is all well and good.

But  I  for one at first didn't realise about the compatibility of my  A1200
and  such  upgrades,  now,  the most common instability  cause  of  the  new
upgrades  not  working on a specific A1200 isn't always caused  by  the  new
upgrades  themselves,  moreso the problems are cause by Commodores  lack  of
hindsight  of future Amiga hardware/software development,  specifically  I'm
talking about the various A1200's motherboard revisions,  this alone is  one
of  the most common causes of an unstable computer setup,  now,  with me not
being  a  considerably technically minded bloke I won't go into the  various
A1200 motherboards that can cause these unstable problems,  but I will go so
far  as to say that personally the two most common revision boards that have
caused  me  and some of my other contacts heaps of hassles is rev  1D.1  and
1D.4,   now,  as far as I'm aware of,  and again,  I'm willing  to  be  told
otherwise,   these  two  boards can be "Fixed" to make  a  fully  compatible
machine,  so if you know of the problems and your more than capable of doing
the fix yourself then fine,  go ahead,  or,  if your aware of what the "Fix"
entails and willing to pass on your knowledge onto others then please do  so
and tell us about it,  or, lastly, either send your motherboard (if it's one
of  these  two  revisions)  off to Eyetech for the "Fix",   after  a  recent
phonecall to Eyetech for prices for the fix to my motherboard,  I  was  told
that  it  would cost £30 plus £9 for p&p,  which might seem a little  steep,
but to it's a small price to pay for a stable machine.
@1
Or on the other hand as the nice techy bloke from Eyetech told me,  the same
boards or most of them of the Escom variety have already had that particular
fix done, so there you go.

Now,  most of us at one time or another gets pissed off with having to watch
out  for  software using to much of the more valuable "2Mb of  Chip  memory"
that the not so wise Amiga creators decided to give us,  it's a pain in  the
arse  having to keep an eye on that memory especially for me having 48Mb  of
FastRAM,  but with DOpus Magellan running as a WB replacement  and  all  the
other  hacks running in the background 2Mb isn't by any chance enough,   but
we  can't change that fact,  WRONG,  we can now,  we can but a graphics card
and a Z4 board,  now, in my opinion (yet again) the graphics card that seems
to be one of the cheapest but very popular at present is the Cybervision 64-
3D  MK  II,  you can I think put 6Mb on the card giving you a whole  8Mb  of
Chip  memory  or is it 4Mb on the card giving you a total of  6Mb  even  so,
with  the  baby you can still add more valuable chip memory  to  your  miggy
that you've already got,  and the chip memory is the most important part  of
the miggy,  and at about £160 for the card,  it's a bloody bargain, BUT, you
need two other items as well in order to use it,  you need a Z4 board, and a
new  Eyetech Z4 towercase,  so your looking at a top price  at  the  most  I
would  say  of  about  £300,  ok,  so its no cheap upgrade,   but  your  two
alternatives  are  either low chip memory,  or worse still,   getting  a  PC
(agggghhhhhh).

Now,  although not compulsory,  but a sensible idea for you if and when  you
decide to go for the Cybervision graphics card,  Z4 board and new Eyetech Z4
towercase,  send your miggy to Eyetech and let them set it all up  for  you,
ok,  so it'll cost you a few quid extra,  but after all lads,  they are  the
experts with all the flashy testing gear,  we aren't,  no,  without  getting
either  myself or the Ripper into a lot of shit over slander and  that  sort
of  crap,  I will say that with the above graphics card,  Z4 board and tower
only  deal with Eyetech,  myself and at least two of my other contacts  will
not  deal  with  Power Computing ever again unless is absolutely  necessary,
but I won't elaborate on that,  ok,  so if Ferret want to exclude that part,
then  so  be  it,   but I don't think that I've crossed too  much  over  the
mythical legal line really.

Now onto software, if any of you have ever wanted to setup DOpus Magellan as
a  WB  replacement  and upon installation of the 3-disk's  have  decided  to
forgot  the idea due to the fact that trying to configure DOpus Magellan  as
a WB replacement seems and absolute nightmare,  fear no more,  I'll help you
if and when possible,  or on the other hand,  your a DOpus Magellan user and
have  the  package  already setup on your A1200 as a  workbench  replacement
then you might be able to help me, who knows.

        Till next time,  all  the  best  and  take  care.............
