ANapster is another Napster clone available for Amiga.  It can be  found  at
@4http://www.crosswinds.net/~jsiv/anapster/@5 ,  there is also  a  mailing  list
@4anapster@onelist
@5
Amiga  has suffered in the past from the fact that it doesn't get the latest
fads  on  the  Net  and  it is good to see at least two @1 (that  I  know  of)
@5versions of Napster now available.

In case anyone doesn't know about or hasn't heard of Napster ,  it is one of
the simplest ways to locate and download MP3's from the Net.

Right,   first get hold of the Napster archive.  Decrunch it and you  should
get a directory.  Copy the directory anywhere you wish.  Thats it!  ANapster
installed.   I should mention that it also requires@1 MUI@5 and@1 Nlist@5  and  Lamp
@1mcc's@5 for@1 MUI@5 ,  but I expect that everyone has them installed already.   It
also  requires you to be running at least Workbench 3.0@1 (but isn't  everyone
now running 3.5 anyway?)@3

                      Anyway, lets see what we do next.
@5
Of  course,   we'll read the guide file first......the author mentions  that
programmers can't write decent docs and he doesn't attempt to do so. Details
are  very  sparse  in  this guide but it tells you  enough  to  get  started
although  it  doesn't mention anything about setting it up,  working  it  or
practically  anything else.  It does ,however,  tell you that  ANapster  was
written with the help of the Linux protocol for Napster

The  guide  says that a good place to start would be to click  the  icon....
@7<See  grab0.>@5  This  is what you should see ,  now right  click  and  go  to
ANapster settings.@7 <See grab1.>
@5
Fill in a nickname ,password and e-mail address,  then go to paths and  tell
it  where you would like to download files to e.g.@1  Work:temp etc.@5  and save
the settings.@7 <see grab2.>@5

You can now connect,  remember you should be on-line at this point.  Connect
means to connect to the Napster server and doesn't mean it will dial in  for
you.   Also,   you may have to change your nickname a few times  before  the
server will allow you to connect, its amazing how many nicknames are already
used  up.   Once you have connected to the server,  you should see something
like  this@7 <see grab5.>@5.  You can now go to the library section and add  any
MP3's that you wish to share with anyone@7 <see grab3.>@5.

Going to the search page,  this is where the action is...... you can fill in
details of what you would like e.g.  as in the grab I have chosen Tori Amos.
You  will  notice  that I have specified minimums for line speed  ,frequency
@1(of the MP3)@5,  and bitrate.  These are not required and are used mostly  for
the  example.  click find it and it will display anything that is  available
for  your search criteria.  Leaving the song part blank means that  it  will
show any song by that particular artist. @7 <see grab6.>@5.  Make your selection
and click get selected song.

Please note that if the song you select is behind a firewall,  you won't  be
able to download it.@7 <see grab7.>@5Hopefully future versions will remedy this.
We'll  assume  that you have found a song and have managed  to  get  it  for
transfer. You should now see this@7 <see grab8.>@5.

And  thats it,  you can watch as the file downloads or go and seek out  some
more favourites.

I  have  only touched on some of the things that ANapster can do.  There  is
also chat, but I'll leave that for you to find out about yourself.

ANapster  doesn't have as many options or look as nice as Amster  but  works
well  and doesn't take a lot of working out or confiiguring.  Go on.....give
it a try.
