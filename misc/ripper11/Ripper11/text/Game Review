*3@2                          PD Game Review@1 :-@4 ARKANOS*2@1
                          -------------------------
@4
Arkanos,@3 a Break out clone, Similar to Arkanoid's, Pong & the Master of them
all@2 MEGABALL@3. Well a strange selection for me to pick this issue! Normally I
would review an Adventure game, So why the change of Heart?

Well!  Time to admit something, I am addicted to@2 MEGABALL@3 ...I just love the
game  ..And no clone or other BAT & BALL has ever come close to knocking  it
off its perch...Until Now!  Yes!@4 ARKANOS@3 comes a very close second in my Bat
& Ball games TOP TEN.

OK!  The game is programmed in AMOS@1 (Stop cringing)@3 I really don't mind AMOS
games @1 (Providing  they work)@3  and there is not really  much  to  say  about
@4ARKANOS@3  that has not already been said about all the other  games  of  this
type.
@6
                              Brief Description@1
                              -----------------
@5
Old  Hat @1 :-@5 You get a Paddle/Bat...A Ball ..and have to hit the  bricks  to
make them disappear.  As in Megaball and various other games of this nature,
Hit a certain brick and it releases a tile which can either be a@1 "Bonus"@5  or
a @1"Baddie"@5 if you pick it up using the Paddle/Bat.

Nothing  unusual there!  ...Well Arkanos has several features not  in  other
games,  Or in fact it seems to have taken all the good features of  all  the
BAT & BALL games and added them all into 1 game. @1 (A description of all  the
tiles to follow)
@5
One  of  the  interesting points of Arkanos is the@1 "Metal Frame"@5 surrounding
the  Screen.  Its not just your@1 "Run of the Mill"@5 square box,  No!  in  some
levels  it has Projections or Notches@1....@5Which means that if you  Ball  hits
one  it  will  spin  off  in a totally different direction  from  which  you
expect@1..@5This  keeps you on your toes and add interests to the  Overall  game
play.
@6
                                   Graphics@1
                                   --------
@5
THe graphics in Arkanos are of an acceptable standard, Not quite as polished
and Professional as MegaBall, But clear and colourful.
@6
                                    Sound@1
                                    -----@5
Again the sound effects are reasonable,  the Metallic@1 "Clunk" @5 when your ball
hits of the Metal wall sound realistic, as does most of the sound effects.
@6
                                 Playability@1
                                 -----------
@5
Loads  of nice little touches in the game,  to heighten your enjoyment.   You
receive a Password after so many levels@1 (Which means that you don't have  to
play  the Same levels again and again.)@5  Another nice touch is that you  can
play the levels in a Random mode@3" What this means is that levels 1-5 can be
played 4-2-5-1-3 Which strangely enough relieves the boredom if you have  to
constantly play one part over again."

I'm  from Austria and was born in 1977.  My first contact with an amiga  was
about  in 1989,  first just playing,  but soon starting with AMIGABasic  and
moved to AMOS, and AMOS Professional.
@2
                   Yes! This game was not coded with C !!!

                           Other Software Released@1
                           -----------------------

Starbase V1.2 is a isometric building game like@3 "Utopia"@1,  with space  ships
to build and to wipe out the four@3 "neighbours"@1 next to your base.
 
Diamond  Challenge  V0.9ß  is a platform game  where  you  have  to  collect
several  amount  of  diamonds to finish a level.  Some baddies  and  special
tools make it harder, of course.

The  game is freeware,  but the level editor is shareware and can be ordered
from me, like Arkanos.

Colonization  Map  Editor  V1.0 is just a map  editor  for  the  great  game
@2"Colonization"@1 from Microprose. It's giftware.

@3
Future  releases I'm just planning Arkanos version 1.2,  which will  finally
include the best features of all breakout games from Aminet!!!

Starting in summer and testing will result to be finished in December 2000.

                           Bonus Tiles Description@1
                           -----------------------
@1
  *)@3 GET KILLED@5  You loose your current paddle. But get 40 points!
                 Always take it if the ball move to the same position
                 instead of loosing the ball with no points. Sorry.
@1
  *)@3 BONUS DOWN@5  Decreases your bonus points by about 200 to 400.
@1
  *@3) BONUS UP @5 Increases your bonus points by about 100 to 300.
@1
  *)@3 HALF BONUS @5 Halfs your bonus points. Oops.
@1
  *)@3 DOUBLE BONUS@5  Doubles your bonus points. Yeah.



@1
  *)@3 RESTART LEVEL@5  Re-initialize current level. If there are only a
                    few special blocks always take it. Otherwise your
                    ball may be trapped, and you must use the DEL key.
@1
  *)@3 SLOW BALL@5  Decreases ball speed by 4. You need more SLOW BALL if
                the speed is about 20 or higher for a better playing
                speed.
@1
  *)@3 CATCH BALL@5  Activates the catch field on your paddle. This is the
                 flashing line at the top of your paddle. If you take
                 this  bonus twice, the catch field will be removed.
@1
  *)@3 EXPAND PADDLE@5  Increases your paddle size by one. This means 16
                    pixel extra space to get the ball. Maximum size
                    is 6, so your paddle is at the most 96 pixel large.
                    (about a third of the total level width)
@1
  *)@3 SHRINK PADDLE@5  Decreases your paddle size by one. You loose 16
                    pixel to catch the ball. Minimum size is 1. It's
                    very hard to get the ball with that short paddle.


@1
  *)@3 BRICKTHROUGH@5  If you take this bonus the ball will move through
                   all blocks, except the SHORT CUT and WALLS. But I
                   must warn you: If there are many BALL SPEED UP blocks,
                   the ball will speed up very fast, and . .  .   .    .
                   Away !!! Take this bonus again, and the ball behaves
                   normal.
@1
  *)@3 ZAP EXPANDER@5  Removes all expanding blocks on the level. Another
                   warning comes up: You can use expanding blocks to
                   break through INDESTRUCT blocks, and if you remove
                   them... 8-)
@1 
  *)@3 ZAP SPECIAL@5  Removes all special blocks. These are BALL SPEED UP,
                  BALL SPEED DOWN, RANDOM DIRECTION and MOVING BLOCK.
                  I think you can always take this bonus. No warning.
@1 
  *)@3 ZAP INDESTRUCT@5  Removes all indestructible attributes of the level.
                     This means: INDESTRUCT will be removed completely,
                     1-HIT INDESTRUCT will be replaced by a normal block
                     (the red one) and all 5-, 4-, 3-, 2-HIT BLOCKS will
                     also be replaced by a normal block (the grey one).



@1
  *)@3 MORE DYNAMITE@5  Expands all exploding blocks, one the each side: up,
                    down, left and right. But remember: exploding blocks
                    only count 8 points. Nevertheless a very effective
                    way to complete a level.
@1
  *)@3 LASER PADDLE@5  Activates the lasers on your paddles. The paddle will
                   change totally. Use left mouse button to fire laser.
                   Don't fire them too often. Every mouse click resets
                   your laser, even if you didn't hit anything. Remember
                   this if you want to fire at blocks on the top of the
                   level.
@1
  *)@3 NEXT LEVEL@5  Brings you to the next level straight away and counts
                 down the left bonus points. Remember all the left points
                 on this level before you take it. Also remember if the
                 next level gets harder. Think quick, if it's worth. ;-)
@1
  *)@3 EXTRA PADDLE@5  Gives you an extra paddle. But removes all extras,
                   like CATCH BALL, LASER PADDLE and BRICKTHROUGH. You
                   also loose 100 bonus points. That's not really bad.


@1
  *)@3 BONUS DIAMONDS@5  There are also 8 different coloured bonus diamonds.
                     If you catch all 8 diamonds you get 3 extra paddles
                     but remember that you take them in toggle mode. One
                     diamond also counts 100 points. It's hard to let
                     them fall down, but you will really need them on
                     higher levels!  8-)


@4
  From level 101 to 200 the bonus tiles will be hidden until they leave
  the level area. So you've just a second to look at it and decide to
  take or not.

@3
IF  you  are  a  fan of this type of game,  or if you are just  looking  for
something  to entertain you for a couple of hours, #8 GET IT@3.   Arkanos  is  a
Brilliant effort that will not disappoint.The only Negative comment I  would
have regarding Arkanos is.  The#8 16@3 letter password for the levels,  The game
is  free  and I do feel that typing 16 letters in each time a bit excessive,
Other than that an excellent game.
