                                  ------------@5


Hiya,  i'm one of the newest members of the quickly growing@2 RIPPER@5 team.  My
real name is Jonathan Bryant and i'm 20 years of age.  I live in Birmingham,
England and as you might know by now am a Music nut!

I started off with an Amiga 500 when I was still in primary school and loved
it's fast racing games like Stunt Car Racer,  but also got very involved  in
the  techie side of certain utilities and programs like Sequencer One,  Amos
and  D-Paint.  I was yet to find my neche on the Amiga but had already found
my  passion in the music industry.  I played Kraftwerk and Jean Michel Jarre
records  to  death and tried to copy everything I heared on  a  small  Casio
keyboard.   I  even  managed to learn the whole  of  the  ending  song  from
@1"Another  World"@5,  which was to become one of mine and  my  ST  owner  mates
games.

As  soon as I discovered Protracker 1 and a handfull of sound samples I  was
hooked.  My first songs were absolutley terrible but I loved the ease of use
of  the  program  and  it's flexible aproach to adding sounds.  @3 MIDI@5  still
wasn't  heard of in my vocabulary yet.  I quickly made a lot of contacts  in
the world of Amigans, with the help of various Amiga magazines at the time.

I  don't know how I coped back then without a hard drive and only a 1/2  meg
upgrade.  All my sounds and songs were stored on various disks lying  around
the  place  and finding what I wanted was a nightmare.  When  the  CD32  was
released,   I  immediatly  snapped one up and  was  amazed  by  it's  better
graphics and sound quality.  A personnel favourite was Jetstrike,  you can't
beat the CD-32 version of that game.

Eventually  I  reached the limits of both machines and was  frustrated  with
what  I  was so close to reaching sometimes,  only to be given  an @1 "Out  of
Memory"@5 error.  The time had come for the magnificent A1200.  I swapped  the
bare  500  and  CD32 for an A1200 with HD,  tons of games and various  extra
plug ins.  Now I was content. By this time I had also discovered@3 OctaMED@5 and
was  quickly  working through version upon version of that.  A  much  better
program  than  ProTracker I thought.  Now owning the 1200 I made  even  more
contacts  for swapping games,  samples,  modules,  pics and almost everthing
else.   One contact I made through Amiga Format was a nice chap by the  name
of  Nick from Valjevo in Serbia.  He was and is a great friend to me and has
helped  me  with  my  music  and given me tips and encouragment  in  getting
somewhere  in  the industry.  He also got me into the much harder  but  very
powerful  OctaMED Soundstudio which is what I currently use if  i'm  writing
modules.  Not long after getting an A1200,  I bought my first pair of  decks
and  started to mix various Techno,  Hardcore,  House etc records,  and even
experimented with mixing my OctaMED tunes with a record!



@5
Another Amiga fan I met was Gavin Gunn, @2 aka Fester@5.  He told me about a new
diskmag called@4 The Crypt@5 and knew that I wrote mods so got me in touch  with
the Editor,  Ray@1 (Dungeon Master)@5.  I appeared first of all at about issue 4
with  a  track entitled Dungeon which was a vast change from  what  Ray  had
been  used  to  and  my style instantly became a success within @4 The Crypt@5,
although i was required to do some remixes of classic tunes to keep the  old
heads occupied.

Although I still use OctaMED to write music for The Ripper I am now  getting
involved  with some@1 MIDI@5 work and have a small studio setup for making  some
real good tunes with.

Now that@4 The Crypt@5 has fallen, I have delight in joining the@2 Ripper@5 team and
doing some work for this excellent mag.

All  I  can say is,  I hope you like my articles and music and if you  would
like to contact me for anything then you can do so by the means of#1:
