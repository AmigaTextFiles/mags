This  is  a reply to plea for articles for the Ripper mag @1(which your  reading
now!)@5   which was made on the ripper mailing list.  This stems from  the  fact
that  support for the Ripper has fallen dramatically culminating in the letter
below from Barry Smith @1(Editor of the Ripper)

BS>@3Hello all,
@1
BS>@3Its with a heavy heart that I greet you all.
@1
BS>@3It seems I was right to jump ship.@1
BS>@3From what I've seen The Great Amiga community had gone.@1 
BS>@3Years ago the spirit that was Amiga was more valued than anything else.
@5
How  can  you  inspire people about the Ripper mag and get them to  contribute
when  you  yourself have admitted to@4 "jumping ship"@5? The spirit  of  Amiga  is
still  here  in a few people,  they are spread thinly in the community  but  I
believe it is still here.
@1
BS>@3NOW ?
@1
BS>@3now you all sit like lemmings,  waiting for something that will never come.
@1BS>@3THE AMIGA IS DEAD,  - well, it is if you all just sit on your fat asses and
@1BS>@3don't speak when your asked to.
@5
A lot of people don`t write articles @4(like myself)@5  because I do not have much
experience  in  article writing and I don`t have a lot to say anyway!  @4 (until
now!)
@1
BS>@3Do  you think that Any company will  give a shit  about a community  that
will not TRY to help its self ? - I am reminded when I think of you lot,  Of
a  wild life program I once watched.  Where an animal was stuck in the  mud,
and started to sink.  As all it needed to do was Call out, or Kick free. All
it did was wait for it to die.
@1
BS>@3DOES THAT SOUND LIKE ANY COMPUTER COMMUNITY THAT YOU KNOW ??
@1
BS>@3well#8 ???
@5
                                 Atari maybe?
@1
BS>@3All we ask is a small review every now and then,  Just one from all of  you
maybe every 2 months,@7 BUT YOU SEND US NOTHING!!!!!!!
@1BS>@3Well,  I'm gona shut the mag down once and for all,if you don't help us out
this time.@1
BS>@3Ripper writers & staff don't get money for doing what we do.  we do it  for
the love of the magazine, & the platform.
@5
A  love  of  the  platform?....@1"it seems I was  right  to  jump  ship"@5...sound
familiar?  How  can you say you love the platform when in the SECOND  sentence
you  say  the  above? I do respect the hard work that everyone does  in  every
issue of the ripper, which is why I read it in the first place.
@1
BS>@3You will help Kill the "beloved" amiga if you all don't stand up when  your
asked.
@5 
Most  of the people on this platform have stood up countless times before  but
now maybe it is because that apathy has crept in,  and they are struggling  to
find the fighting spirit?
@1
BS>@3Once again,  I'm glad I went Linux.  GLAD I have people who Help when  they
are asked. Hell, Even windows users help more than this mags readers list. 
@5
And  how  many  users  has windows got? You have to remember  that  the  amiga
community has been decimated over the years with countless buyouts  that  lead
to nothing,  people have been leaving the platform in droves, mainly after the
failed  buyouts and when bigname amiga companies going to the wall,  you  tend
to  lose most users at this time as the disillusioned look for a "safe" refuge
for their computing needs.  There was a time not so long ago when I knew loads
of  people with Amigas,  sadly they have#8 *@3ALL#8*@5 sold up to buy PC and PSX`s and
I know @3NO-ONE@5 with an amiga now!
@1 
BS>@3To write this letter to you all,  makes me physically sick,  I'd rather  cut
off my own limb then finally leave my beloved Amiga community
@5
Yeah,   it  makes me sick to read it & how many left handed  linux  users  are
there then? By the sound of it YOU have made up your mind already.
@1
BS>@3IF YOU DON'T WANT US, WE WILL NOT STICK AROUND!
@5 
You  will  always be wanted and needed as the more magazines like  the  ripper
cease  to  be,  the more the users will be cut off to the dwindling community.
Stick  with it,  this is the summer of our discontent@1 (ahem)@5  but there  is  a
light  on  the horizon,  Amiga Inc have at last started the ball  rolling  and
have  done more than any other owners of the amiga ever did,  users  will  see
this  and they will be hanging on,  probably for one last time,  to  see  what
happens  and  they need mags like yours to read info and ask  questions  about
our  future.  So to desert us at this time would be to drive another  nail  in
the coffin.
@1
BS>@3With heavy heart, 
@1BS>@3Barry Smith
@1BS>@3(Former ??) Ripper Editor
@5
I  have also a heavy heart,  after reading your message which prompted  me  to
write this article.

So  a  final  message to the readers,  I will be trying to write articles  for
this magazine, I will try to support our community, what will you do#8?
@1
   "@7Only the Amiga makes it possible@1"......@5but it can`t do it on it`s own!

Well!   People that are not on the Ripper Mailing list,  Might be quite  taken
aback  at the original Mail from Barry.  As were quite a few that are  on  the
list,   However I am sure it was written in a moment of "dire" Frustration and
annoyance  that  once  AGAIN we have to "Badger" "Bully"  and  "Threaten"  the
readers to get them to submit articles for inclusion in the Magazine.

Strange!  that after this posting, We received several articles, just the next
day!   Proof  @1(if  any  was required)@4  That the ability  is  there,   But  the
willingness lacking.

The letter from Barry was as@2 "A Kick up the Backside"@4 Fortunately it worked  as
intended and generated the required response. On the subject of "Jumping Ship"
Well  its  true the our editor has been using "Linux" running on a  PC  ...For
quite  some  time now.  However is any further proof was required  as  to  his
loyalties He continues to Produce the Ripper @1(an Amiga based Magazine)@4. Lets
face it do Amiga Inc use the Outdated Amiga1200 for all their office staff? Do
the printed Magazines use Amiga's and Pagestream for their presentation ,  NO!



People must use the most applicable tools at hand to do the job to the best of
their  ability.  Barry compiles the Web version of the Ripper,  A  PC  running
"Linux" is far better equipped to handle this task than any Amiga.

As  James  says @1 "Support our community" ...@4I don't think  We @2 (at  Dreamscape
Productions)@4 need to Prove OUR loyalty Rather that the readers out there who
do not contribute to the Magazine#8 NEED@4 to prove their loyalty
