                REVIEW@1:@4 Blizzard 1260 Accelerator*2@1 (for A1200)
@5
When  I first got my Amiga A1200 way back in 1994,  I was amazed at the  speed
of  the thing compared to the computer I had had previously,  a lowly Sinclair
Spectrum +2A.

However,  as the years wore on,  and new, more demanding software was produced
@3[Alien  Breed 3D 2 does not count,  that demanded hardware that still  doesn't
exist!  @1 :-)@3]@5 I realised that my 68020 based A1200 was just not  cut  out  for
hardcore use. Something had to be done.

So,   I spent eighty of my hard earned notes on an Apollo 1230 Mk.  IV.   This
upgraded my stock A1200 to @1(what I thought)@5  was a super 68030 processor, with
the full whammy when it came to MMU's and 68882 FPU's etc. etc.

I  persevered with this faster machine for about 5 months,  before I  realised
that I still didn't have enough processing power for what I wanted to do  with
my  Amiga  @1(3D rendering,  and I still haven't produced anything  decent  from
Imagine!)@5   so I posted a request on the Amiga Format Bulletin for  a  second-
hand 68060 accelerator.




Within a day,  I had e.mail contact with a man from Surrey who was selling his
Blizzard 1260 accelerator for a mere@2 £150@5,  a price that I was told  was  very
good at the time...

                                    It was
@5
After  receiving the accelerator@1 (and I had to hold up many  small  shops  and
post offices to get the cash)@5  I somehow managed to shove it into the trapdoor
slot  on  my  desktop A1200 @1(I still haven't towered it up,  but  it  will  be
soon!)@5   to  find that there was about 5mm of space between the  edge  of  the
board  and the case.  I was reluctant in doing so,  but I shoved a screwdriver
down the gap so I could lever the card in firmly.

I  booted  up  my hard drive to Workbench,  and was absolutely amazed  at  the
speed it booted up in!  About five/six times faster than my 68020, maybe more!
I  started  to tinker about with programs,  amazed at how fast they  were  now
running.  PPaint was a dream to use, and my Internet software was now actually
usable in higher resolutions than 640x256x3!!!



The card itself features a full 68060 processor @1(i.e.  it includes a MMU and
a FPU)@5  and has provisions for one 72-pin SIMM, and an optional SCSI-II add-
on  controller.   They are quite expensive brand new  @1(you  are  looking  at
anything  up to £300 for a brand new one,  easily)@5  so it pays to  look  for
second hand boards.  Just make sure you can send it back for a refund if the
person you buy from is doing a dodgy.

You  can fit up to 64MB of RAM in to the SIMM socket @1(although this  may  be
128MB RAM,  I never got a manual with mine,  so I am not sure!)@5  so there is
plenty  of  room  for  memory increases.  I believe the SCSI-II  addon  also
includes an extra SIMM socket, allowing for even more memory!!!

All in all,  the Blizzard 1260 is a great purchase,  my best to date.  It  may
not  have  the raw speed of a PPC and a BVision,  but if you aren't interested
in all that PowerPC guff, it's just right!!!
@3
  In other words, if you are still on your measly 68020,@6 UPGRADE@1!!!!!!!! :)
