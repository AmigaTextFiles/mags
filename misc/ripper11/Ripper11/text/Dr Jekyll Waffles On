                       @2Dr Jekyll Waffles on (Yet Again)@1
Admitedly  the title to this article seems a bit strange,  but  having  said
that,  the it's creator is very strange,  and I suppose "Snoopy" (one of  my
contacts)  will agree with that,  anyway, this article will most probably be
2 or 3 smaller articles roled into one big file, so here goes.
@4
            So here starteth the first lesson....................
@5
Ooops, before I forget, this is just a quick mention for one of our lads and
his  mum,  the lad in question is Andrew Jackson who at present is having  a
few problems,  no,  not with his Amiga but himself, I was talking last night
(Sunday  the 30th 2000)  to Ray Hawkins (or Dungeon Master  as  I  know  him
better  as)   about a few tweaks in DOpus Magellan that I've helped  him  to
install  and  configure  as  a  WB replacement,   and  he  told  me  of  the
unfortunate  circumstances that both Andrew and his mum find  themselves  in
at present,  I won't for decency's sake tell you about their problems,  it's
not  the  done thing,  all that I will say that Andrew is having a very  bad
time  at  present with his nerves,  I've been there myself and so sympathise
with  him,  so from me Andrew and your mum,  please take care and  all  your
mates  wish  you both the best for the coming months,  and Ray  Hawkins  and
myself are there for any possible help we can give,  my telephone number  is
01788-570198,  hope you don't mind Mrs Jackson me mentioning your plight, it
was  done with the intention of helping you both through this bad time,  all
the best to you both from me (Steve Hyde AKA Dr Jekyll).


@1
Right,  sorry for straying from my tasks at hand,  but we lads in the  Amiga
society have to help one another when and where we can,  regardless  of  any
gripes  or niggles we've had with others in the past,  ok,  so  I'm  an  old
softie at heart,  but I do care somtimes about my fellow being, well, unless
they are named as Gary Emery, in which case, SOD OFF.
@6
Ok,  so down to business, (wheres my medication, oh yes, here it is, now, is
it  3 tablets 6 times a day,  or 6 tablets 3 times a day,  oh what the hell,
here goes.............
@1
That's it,  no more pissing about, here comes the serious stuff......Firstly
I  want to talk about Towering up you miggy (oh not again I can here some of
you moan,  sorry but yes,  towering up your miggy is almost as important  to
the general running and usage and future upgrading of your system, almost as
important  as  the  women not wanting to miss Emmerdale  or  Eastbenders  or
Neighbours and Home and Have it Away,  thing of towering up your miggy along
the  same  lines as importance to that of the discovery of  the  wheel,   or
Einstein's Theory or relativity,  I joke not my friends,  the miggy is  what
we all or most of us users love,  even when the fucker crashes on us for  no
apparent reeason.




@2
Well  your  system can crash for a number of resons,  the most common  being
inadequate power supply which is one of the main causes,  a tower especially
from  Eyetech  with a 250 watt PSU will go a long way towards  solving  that
problem,   also the large Eyetech towers will go a long way  to  being  very
compatible with any future upgrades you decide to do on your miggy,   except
for  those who want to go over to the Z4 cards and Cybervisionc64 3D graphic
cards,   then you'll have to but the specially designed Z4 tower  for  that,
but that's another matter.



A  tower  will also mean that all those unsightly wires that used  to  cover
your  computer desk like some crazy man eating vine from sci-fi  films  will
all  be trapped or tucked away inside the tower,  admittedly you'll  end  up
having to use a PC keyboard,  well, unless you spend an extra few quid on an
A4000  keyboard,   which thanks to Malc Megabite he recently  sold  me  one,
cheers Malc.



Now,  one of the necommers in The Ripper (along with myself)  is called  Ray
Hawkins (Dungeon Master)  up till recently totally rejected the idea of ever
towering  his  miggy up,  for reasons of making a bit PCish I suppose,   but
anyway,  it was only till recently that Master Craig Daines (Hercules)  from
our  ex-  diskmag The Crypt has decided to upgrade his miggy  to  the  newly
advertised  Z4  board CV63 3D graphics cards and Eyetech specially  designed
Z4 tower,  and so he decided to sell his old six-storey (a joke between Ray,
Craig  and myself about the size of the old tower)  and sell his old Eyetech
MkII  tower  to Ray H,  having bought it and thanks to Craig,  Ray  recently
said  to  me  on the phone one night that it was probably one  of  the  best
investments he had ever made for his trusty old miggy,  a big beefy PSU will
stop  or  ease the crashes which are caused by smaller PSU's,  and  with  so
much space in the tower for future upgrading og a Zip drive,  or an LS  120,
a  CD ROM rewriter etc etc he'll be well and truly sorted in that department
for the future.
@3
But until then, the spare bays will be advertised in his local estate agents
window  under  the title "To Let" these spare bays will be mainly  aimed  at
first-  time  "buyers"  such as students,  or any  of  the  Coloured  people
amongst  us,  as yet Ray has to work out a suitable rent,  but  will  notify
those  people  when such a rate has been readily worked out  accordingly  to
the  office  of  fair rents (snigger,  what a load of crap I  write....don't
answer that Snoopy).

Also,  by owing a tower, doing a soft-reset is a easy as pressing one button
as opposed to the old way of a 3-key Amiga keyboard press, just think of the
times you've been on your miggy and one of your mates phones up, during your
conversation you need to do a soft-rest for whatever,  do you  (A)   try  to
balance  the phone on your shoulder and end up looking a bit like Quasimodo,
or (B)  end up by putting the phone down to perform the reset,  or (C) get a
bloody soft- reset button fitted to your A1200,  or wire up the one in  your
tower  if you've got a tower but haven't bothered or known how to  wire  the
reset button up.
@1
During a phone-call to Tom Spicer a while ago,  I found out that  he  had  a
tower,  but didn't know how to wire up the little soft-reset button  on  the
front of the tower,  ans if my memory serves me correctly, it was me who was
one  of  the first lads in our days with The Crypt diskmag to use this  hack
successfully,  I do know from experience that this little hack can  be  used
to wire up existing tower soft-reset buttons,  or hacked onto a bog-standard
A1200 case,  and truthfully speaking, if you've got an ounce of intelligence
(which  I haven't as my mate Snoopy tells me more often than not)   most  of
you who need such a device can perform the hack yourself,  a soldering iron,
and  some  solder and a steady hand is all that is required as  far  as  the
physical  side  of  things go,  and a basic knowledge of soldering  is  also
required for the task.



The hack can be done in one of two ways,  having said that,  the second  way
involves  soldering  two  very   fine   wires  onto  the  U13  chip  on  the
motherboard,   and  although I've done both variations  at  different  times
during  my days on the my A1200,  I'll stick to the simplest way  this  time
for you, ok.
@6
So for none tower owners I won't bore you all with the obvious details about
opening up your miggy etc,  that is common sense,  isn't it??,  so with your
miggy  opened up and your keyboard and bits removed in order to expose  your
A1200's  motherboard you need to look at the lower left hand corner  of  the
motherboard,  by the PCMCIA slot,  you'll see two rows of solder blobs named
as TP1 and TP2,  our hack revolves around soldering two small wires onto the
first two solder at the far left of TP1,  it doesn't matter which way  round
the wires go,  just so long as they only go on the first two leftmost solder
blobs, but be careful not tow run solder onto any of the other blobs.

OK,  so you've soldered to small short wires to the two blobs,  I would  now
advise  you to connect a small double plastic juntion block onto  these  tow
wires after you've stripped and tinned both wires (people who do a fair  bit
of  soldering  will  understsnd  those  terms,   next,   you  need  a  small
subminature "MAKE SWITCH",  not a normal switch, a "Make" switch is one that
"Makes"  a circuit complete by a single press,  but also "Breaks"  the  same
circuit on release of the same button,  a "Make Switch" will cost you a  few
pence I think from most Tandy's store,  or from Maplins, or most hobby shops
that deal in basic electronics.

Now,  the two wires that you've just connected to the plastic junction block
both need to be soldered onto the contacts of the "Make Switch",  then  tidy
up  the  two wires and wrap a few bits of insolating tape aound the  two  of
them not to isolate them because they should already be isolated,  but so as
to keep them both neat and kept together while at the same time you need  to
decide  which  direction  your  going  to  feed  them  over  or  around  the
motherboard  so as to somehow fit this subminature "Make Switch"  onto  your
A1200  case  somewhere that's going to handy and within easy reach  to  you,
when  that's  all  done,  reconnect all the bits back onto the  motherboard,
such  as  the  keyboard etc,  but at this stage don't put  your  A1200  case
together yet just in case of problems.
@1
Power  up  your miggy,  then with a light push on the new button your  miggy
should  hopefully  reset itself,  if all works ok then diconnect  everything
again,  power lead etc, then finish off by putting your migghy back together
again,   and  hopefully you'll now have fitted a fully  working  soft  reset
button,  tower owners only need to solder two wires onto the motherboard the
same  as the standard A1200 users,  then terminate these two wires with  the
same  type  of junction block,  then wire up the two wires from your  towers
soft  reset  button and your in business,  no more hassles  with  trying  to
reset your miggy whilst on the phone, sorted geezer.

Some  people say that the miggy is dead,  some say that it's far from  dead,
but  even  me as a true blue-bloodied Amiga supporter will stick  his  kneck
out  and say that the miggy we all once knew is not so much dead nor  is  it
alive as we once remember it,  I will say that due to modern technology  and
the  need  for faster and more powerful CPU processors and new DOS operating
systems,   the  miggy has had to adapt or be adapted into  a  new  millenium
machine in order to live on......

With  the birth of a new PC/Amiga clone of which I've just read about,  this
is  the nearest thing that us older Amiga users will ever see again in their
days of a new type of Amiga,  when the first miggy especially the A1200  was
first  created,  computer technology was in it's infancy,  some  years  have
passed and with the development of the big PC's,  the miggy has had to adapt
itself  in  order to still be a worthwhile machine for people to still  use,
and  although  things in the recent past with Escom and  Gateway  2000  both
bottling out due to lack of financial gain,  Bill and "Shaggy Carpet (as Ray
Hawkins now calls him)  have taken over and with a joining up with  Tao  and
the  like,   it  now  seems as though our prayers for a new  reliable  Amiga
saviour to help up has finally come into being,  the only price we've had to
pay  is  losing  the status symbol "Shape" of the miggy we've  all  come  to
know, but as we all know, with progress come change.

@2
I  personally think that at first in my earlier days on the miggy it  was  a
bloody good machine with an even better design and shape,  but my views have
changed  with  upgrades and add-ons such as bigger hard  drives  which  mean
miggy  need to have more power,  hence built into towercases now,   graphics
cards seems to be the new "In-Thing",  again,  more power is needed for  the
old  miggy  together with more space,  so a tower is now more of a necessity
that  an  upgrade,  well,  that if you want to stay in touch with the  miggy
scene  for  as long as possible,  if not,  then keep your old A1200  as  you
first bought it and fall behind.

Upon  making contact recently with a bloke who advertised in Micro Mart  for
any  A1200  users to please write to him with help on  how  to  sort  out  a
problem with and old word processor called Word Perfect I contacted the  guy
(name with held obviously),  I was stunned to find out that in this day  and
age he was only using a 1Mb A600 and two floppy drives,  no hard drive,  was
this bloke lost or what,  anyway,  after a good hour or so chat on the phone
to  him  one  Saturday or Sunday,  It soon became apparent that although  he
wanted  to  upgrade to a better machine,  he didn't have or know  the  right
sources in who to ask for help from,  anyway,  I made a quick phone call  to
one of my contacts who was selling a complete A1200 system that had the  lot
in order to just plug and go,  decent hard drive,  8Mb Ram card,  A1200, etc
etc,  the price was sensible, about £250 inclusive of p&p I think, anyway, I
phone  this  new contact back,  told him the deal,  gave him my own  contact
phone number and left the rest to the both of them to work out the deal,   I
then  get  a phone call from my own contact saying that this new lad  passes
on  his thanks to me for sorting out such a good deal,  and the deal was now
signed and sealed,  and that my contact would soon be getting the money  for
the whole package, great I thought.
 @2
I  had helped a fellow user who was stuck in a rut with a machine that in my
opinion has not so much died,  but was never really born,  and now this user
was about to experience a whole new exciting world of computing with such  a
good computer as the A1200,  anyway,  as normal I could and have waffled  on
about this particular subject far too long,  but I hope that you all realise
what I'm trying to say,  if not,  then send your questions on either  a  £20
note,   a  packet of fags,  or a packet of featherlite Strawberry  flavoured
condoms to:-........
@3
Right,   this  next item is really of some importance,  it  concerns  3  new
upgrades  on the market which I think I will put under one label "Graphics",
the three items being,  the new Z4 card,  the Cybervision64 3D Graphics card
and lastly the Eyetech Z4 Towercase,  now,  although the towercase is only a
item  for  putting the other two into I think that it should be  classed  as
part of this package if your going to upgrade to a graphics card,  you  see,
as  far  as  I  know you can't use the above graphics card  without  the  Z4
board,  and one of the Z4's main funtions is to support graphics card,   and
again,  as far as I know,  the only tower available to support the other two
items  is  the  Eyetech  Z4 tower,  so yes,  these  three  items  should  be
categorized as one package.

Anyway,   the reason for typing this file and telling you about these  three
items is so as to point out the possible implications of what could possibly
turn your working miggy into a totaly knackered system.
@1
Two  of  my contact namely "Snoopy" and Craig Daines (aka Hercules from  our
days  with  The Crypt)  have both just upgraded their respective systems  to
with the above items,  now,  Snoopy followed all the technical help that was
supplied  down to the letter,  but upon bootup time he found his system  was
dead as the pervebial dodo,  diagnosis, one fucked up motherboard and WB 3.1
ROMS  I  think,  solution,  pay ourmore cash and send the cah and  his  full
system  off to Eyetech for them to install and setup everything,   which  of
course has cost him a lot of cash in the first place for the Z4 board,   the
Z4  Tower and Cybervision64 3D graphics card,  and with him having  to  send
the  whole lot off to Eyetech to get them to sort it all out it's  cost  the
poor  lad another £150 or so quid on top,  which even for us workers  is  no
joke.

Craig on the other hand had a slightly different problem but the end results
were almost the same, being the clever sod that he is (ex Crypt members will
know  of  his  computer skills)  Craig and his mate installed  all  the  new
hardware  onto  Craig's  A1200 themselves,  and  apparently  Craig's  system
booted  up  ok  and  worked for a few days,  but then disater  struck,   and
although I don't exactly know what happened,  then end result was almost the
same as Snoopy's, a knackered A1200T system.

So what do we do in order to stop or cut the risk our our machines ending up
like these two lads have done,  well I think that there are two way of doing
it,   well,   that's of course if you want to add a graphics  card  to  your
system  which  for  the less technical amongst us means  that  with  if  the
cybervision graphics card has got 4 Mb fitted to it then together with  your
standard  A1200's  2Mb of chip RAM you'll end up with 6Mb  of  chip  memory,
which we must all admit has got to be a real good added bonus,  so following
on  from  above,  what do we do to hopefully stop our systems up like  these
two lads have done,  personally I would prefer to pay an extra few quid  and
send of most of my system to Eyetech and let them do the installation,  that
way  you'll know that it's been done properly,  and no,  I'm not saying that
these  two  lads done things wrong,  it's just that the new Z4 tower  is  so
tight for space inside it that anything could have caused their problems.
@4
If  Ferret  and Static and the other staff don't mind I as Dr  Jekyll  would
like  to  possibly introduce another aspect to the slowly  growing  list  of
items  that  the later versions of The Ripper have to offer,   the  item  in
question is for special occasions such as Birthdays,  Anniversaries (and no,
the  wife  and myself are due either of these two at present,  I would  like
any  of  us  to write in and tell the other lads about any special  occasion
that is coming up for any one of us,  don't be shy,  ok, admitedly the older
ones  amongst us don't really want to let on their true ages,   even  though
Ray  Hawkins/Dungeon Master keeps telling me he's only 40  or  so  I  reckon
that he's nearer 60 (snigger).

Now,   I  don't know know or can't remember if this has been tried  or  done
before,  but either way,  let's all try to give it a good go, that way, some
of  us might get a Birthday car or similar and also it might help us all  to
get  to  know some of the others who only ever write articles,  I personally
make  contact  via lettera and the odd phonecall to Static  and  Ferret  and
regular  letters  and  phonecalls to Ray Hawkins,  and  recently  I've  made
contact with Malc Megabite,  to keep not only The Ripper going but also  the
amiga  we all must try to make more contact with some of the others  on  the
scene,   ok,  admitedly there have been and maybe still are the odd  contact
who  ripped us off,  one such lad who has dealt with a few of us  is  called
Gary Emery,  but apparently he's moved onto the Playstation,  so Playstation
owners be aware of this little fucker, he's bad news.
@6
I also made contact with Tom Spicer some time ago, but I'm still waiting for
his (your) reply Tom, anytime this year will be fine mate.

C'mon  lads,   why  don't some of you who only write articles  try  to  make
contact  with the others,  after all we are supposed to be on the same  team
AREN'T WE??.
Till next time,  and if any of you who have never written to me or phoned me
wish  to do so,  the give me a bell on Rugby 01788-570198 or drop me a  line
to Dr Jekyll or Steven.P.Hyde/20 Charles St/Rugby/Warks/ CV21 2EW,  ok, till
next  time  then,   keep  on  supporting  the  miggy,   you  know  it  makes
sense....Bye
                              (Dr Jekyll/Steve).
