                            AmigaWriter 2.0 Review*2@1
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@5
It's  been  a  very  long  time,  since the latest version  of  AmigaWriter,
version  1.2  came out.  Even at that time, @1 Haage&Partner@5 already  realised
that  AmigaWriter  was far from finished,  and promised  a  free  update  to
version 2.0 for every customer.  And now,  long time thereafter, this update
is finally here.



The  developers  have been tied up with other projects  in  the  past  year,
which explains the delay,  even if some would say it doesn't excuse it.  But
now, the wait is over, and we can have a look at the finished product.

                           So what is AmigaWriter#1?@1
                           ======================

                              -----------------
@5
As  the name suggests,  AmigaWriter is a word processor.  Before version  1,
the workname was EasyWriter,  but since the name was already taken,  it  had
been changed to AmigaWriter before the first release.  If you think you  can
simply  open  a  page,  start typing,  and print it out,  you  are  mistaken
though.  Of course you can use the program that way,  but you would miss out
on some of the special features that way.  As is the case with most,  if not
all,   modern wordprocessors,  AmigaWriter tries hard to bring you some  DTP
like options in@1 "just a wordprocessor"@5.



This already shows when you start a new document.  Rather than just be given
a new page to work on, you will be presented with the following requester#1:
@3


                        (See Amigawriter Screen Shots)

@5
From here,  you can select a template to open,  you can select how footnotes
and  endnotes  should  appear,   and  you  can  select  the  page  size  and
orientation.  Of course,  you can just start the page as default,  but  this
would  lead you to miss ease of use later.  As you go along,  you can create
loads of templates for all sorts of files,  such as business letters,   love
letters,  technical documents,  books and whatever you can think  of.   This
helps  you to keep a consistent look throughout documents of the same  kind.
Now you can start typing,  and you could be forgiven to think it's just like
any  old  wordprocessor.   You  can type and edit  text,   insert  graphics,
spellcheck your document,  create a nice layout,  and, if you have to, print
it out!@3

                               Let's look at it@1
                               ----------------
@5
But,  let's us not run before we can walk.  Let us just take a look  at  the
program,  and take it apart one by one.  Of course,  presentation counts for
the first impressions.  Well,  I got my version on a CD-Rom, which installed
without  a problem using the provided installer.  A nice addition  for  this
Dutch  guy was,  to find a Dutch translation being installed in the process,
so  all  menus  appear in my mother language.  This wasn't a  big  surprise,
since  I wrote the translation myself,  but other languages are being worked
on.  For now it comes in German@1 (of course)@5,  English@1 (why?)@5  and Dutch.


One  thing  new is that no assign needs to be added to your startup-sequence
anymore.  I like this in a program, it creates an assign to AMIGAWRITER: the
first  time you start it,  instead of on every bootup of your Amiga.   Next,
you of course are greeted by a registration requester,  because this program
comes  with a different serial number than AW 1.2.  After that,  the program
loads.@3

                            Hey, good looking....@1
                            ---------------------

@5
Beauty  is in the eye of the beholder.  This goes for the user interface  as
well.  After the program start you see two tool bars.  The horizontal  holds
buttons for loading,  printing, text styles, text formatting and such forth,
and the vertical one holds buttons for creating text or imageboxes,  and for
the different catalogues. I'll tell you more about the concept of catalogues
in a minute,  because it is one of the standard concepts of AmigaWriter. The
interface  is  clear,   but  would not be nominated  for  any  Miss  Germany
contest.  Not even a@4 Miss Scotland@5 contest for that matter. It is built with
the  use  of StormWizard and the StormWizard.library,  which means you  have
bubble help for all options.


@3
                             Some of the options@1
                             -------------------
@5
Well,  some of the options you would expect in such a program,  is the  load
option.  Nothing special about that,  or is there? Actually, there is: where
most  programs  load  their  own   format,   or  maybe  a  datatype  format,
AmigaWriter  also  loads MSWord documents.  No need to "import"  them,   the
program  just loads it without much problems.  Here comes another new  thing
in AmigaWriter in play: the font substitution manager.


Since it is very unlikely that someone gives you a MSWord document,  and you
have  exactly  the same fonts on your system as he does,  AmigaWriter  lists
all  the  fonts  it can't find on your system,  and gives you  a  chance  to
substitute them with a font of your liking.  The name of the  font  will  be
kept,   and the program just uses this fontname to point at a font  on  your
system.   The advantage is,  that if you load it back on a system  with  the
correct  fonts installed,  the document would use those,  and not the  fonts
you choose for substitution.

                                  Footnotes@1
                                  ---------
@5
When  writing  large documents,  school work or scientific work,   you  will
often  find  the  need  to  include footnotes  or  endnotes  in  your  text.
AmigaWriter has the best options for this of all Amiga wordprocessors.  Just
select insert footnote,  and the footnote will be inserted at the place  you
have  your  cursor.  This is not a bad idea at all,  and one that  is  sadly
lacking in most other Amiga programs.
@3
                            DTP or wordprocessing#1?@1
                            ---------------------
@5
FinalWriter  and  WordWorth  have  both  tried  to  close  the  gap  between
wordprocessing and DTP.  AmigaWriter follows this tradition closely. Text is
not treated as text,  but rather as boxes with something in it,  and you can
place  them  all across the page,  to create the layout you want.   You  can
define for yourself how the text should flow from one page to the next, link
the  boxes,   and all that stuff you have come to expect from wordprocessors
today.  You can place pictures anywhere in your text, in two different ways,
insert pagenumbers,  date and time,  and all that funny stuff you can  think
of.
@3
                                   Pictures@1
                                   --------
@5
As I said,  there are two ways to put pictures on a page. First is to draw a
picture box,  and fill it with the picture of your choice.  You now  have  a
picture you can move across the page,  and put in perfect place.  The  other
method  is by inserting a picture as you would a normal character.  In  text
mode,   select  insert picture,  and a picture will be inserted.   The  only
difference with the picture boxes is,  that this will be treated as  a  text
element.  So, if you type a few lines before your picture, your picture will
move right with it, to keep it's place in the document.


A  big improvement over the previous version is the picture cache.  Pictures
you use in your document,  will be held in a cache,  instead of on disk,  so
if  you scroll through your document,  the pictures need not be loaded  from
disk anymore. This makes for faster scrolling speed than in the old version.

Something  still  missing  from AmigaWriter is  some  basic  drawing  tools.
Jochen  Becher,  the author,  told me that a lot of the  code  for  this  is
already  in  place,   and  a future update should see  those  drawing  tools
implemented.



@3

                               General overhaul@1
                               ================

@5
Apart  from the above mentioned @1"new stuff"@5,  AmigaWriter has got a  general
overhaul,   meaning that speed on AGA or ECS Amigas have  greatly  improved,
printing is faster and better,  and there is a powerpc version.  All in all,
from  a  nearly unusable piece of software,  which promised a lot but didn't
deliver,  a perfectly usable program has evolved.  There is still  room  for
improvement,   such  as  the  drawing tools,  and  maybe  a  more  intuitive
interface to work with,  but it is a program that can be put to good use for
serious wordprocessing.  For the occasional letter writer,  it is a bit  too
much,   and  for  the DTP-people,  it is not enough,  which  brings  up  the
question who can use it? Well, for school work, some serious letter writing,
@1(business  use?)@5,  and the likes it is a good enough program.  If  you  want
more than a simple texteditor, but don't need the power of a full blown DTP-
package,  this might well be worth a look.  It lacks features of FinalWriter
or WordWorth, but it has some features you won't find in these programs.
