  The end is nigh for the Amiga, or is
it?   I  can't  help  wondering  after
waiting the best part of two years for
Gateway  to produce a new Amiga, or at
least   an  Amiga  based  product  and
nothing happening that things were not
looking  too  good?   Then  just after
Christmas  I  heard  the news that the
house  of  Amiga  had  been  sold  yet
again.  This time it was purchased not
by  a  major  computer  company but by
Bill  McEwen  and  his sidekick Fleecy
Moss!

  I  don't  want  to be a party pooper
but if Gateway and all their resources
and    cash    couldn't   design   and
manufacture  a  new  Amiga model, then






what  odds  would  you put on Bill and
Fleecy turning up trumps?

  I  have  to say that time is rapidly
running  out  for  the Amiga.  We have
all  been waiting for@2 FIVE@5 years for a
new  Amiga,  and what have we received
so far?  Far too many broken promises,
several  changes  of  ownership but no
new  Amiga!  Oh yes, let's be cynical,
we @2 HAVE@5  had 3.1 ROM chips and now OS
3.5. Big deal!

  The  Amiga  population  is dwindling
fast  with every day Amigians "hitting
three  keys"  for  the  last  time and
turning  to  that@2 "OTHER"@5 platform.  I
have  personally  not only lost a very
popular disk mag but a large number of
contacts  that  have  purchased either
Pee Cees or Apple Macs.

  Now  even  Amiga  Format has stopped
publishing.   Now  why would they want
to  do  that  I  ask?   The  answer is
obvious.  They were not selling enough
copies  to  make  it  viable.  And why
were  they  not selling enough copies?
Well I don't think for one minute that
all  their  readers  had  switched  to
buying  the  new  Amiga  Active.   The
plain  truth  is  that  there  were no
longer sufficient Amiga owners left!

  As  I  said earlier on, I don't want
to  be  a  party  pooper  but Bill and
Fleecy  had  better  get their fingers
out  and  do  it quickly too.  I don't
think  that  what's  left of the Amiga
community  will wait much longer for a
new machine.  I for one will seriously
consider  packing my Amiga away in the
loft  along  with the C64 and numerous
Speccy micros if there is no new Amiga
by the end of the year!

  Much  the  same applies to this disk
magazine, it's about the only one left
now.   Get it and contribute something
to it, or you will loose it!
