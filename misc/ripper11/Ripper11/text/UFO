@2{UFO'S OVER CHELMSFORD, ESSEX
@3}By Dungeon Master

@5
Having  recently read an article based
on  a  true report read in a newspaper
about  UFO sightings, I thought that I
would  add  a  true  account of what I
observed a good number of years ago.

I recall it was  just  after the death
of Elvis, so  I  reckon  it was around
August or September of  1977. I worked
at  the   time   for   the  Automobile
Association as  a  Control  Officer in
the  control  centre   in  Chelmsford,
Essex. Not that Elvis's  death or whom
I worked for have  any  bearing on the
story I am about to tell you.

There used to be four  of us working a
night shift at  the  A.A. building and






the  usual thing we done on nights was
to take turns  in  sleeping during the
"small  hours".   On   the   night  in
question it had been  my turn and that
of  a  work   mate,   Kevin  ?  (can't
remember his surname)  to sleep. Roger
Brame and Peter Phillips  were the two
operators whose turn it was to stay up
to man  the  phones  and  operate  the
radio should any  breakdown  calls for
assistance come in.

The first I can  recall is being woken
up by Peter Phillips, who was shouting
very excitedly, "Wake up! Wake up! And
you too  Kevin,  come  to  the control
room, there's something  you MUST see!
Quick! Hurry!"

Kevin and I  stumbled  off the couches
in the rest  room  and followed Peter,
who was running back down the corridor
towards the control room. As Kevin and
I entered the room,  Roger was looking
out  of  one   of   the   windows  and
shouting,"Look lads, out over the high
ground at Danbury, it's  still there!"

The A.A.'s control  centre  was on the
top  floor   of   the   building   and
commanded a good  view  over  the town
centre and surrounding countryside.

Kevin and I  raced  to  the  window to
join  Roger   and   Peter   and   were
presented with a very unusual sight.

It was  just  breaking  dawn  and high
above   Danbury   down,    about   4/5
miles southeast of  Chelmsford hovered
an object.  I  can  only  describe the
object as  long, cigar-shaped, pointed
at both ends  and  glowing   white and
red in the centre.
Kevin and I  were  not  amused to have
been waken to see  what appeared to us
to be  an  airship  or  large  weather
balloon, hovering in the  sky with the
first rays of  sunlight reflecting off
of it. I told  Roger  and Peter what I
thought it was, and Kevin agreed too.

"Yes," said Roger, "We  too thought it
might be a promotional airship when we
fist saw it appear  due south over the
Hanningfield area, but  then  it moved
at  colossal  speed   to  its  current
position." Peter added, "No airship or
balloon could  travel  that  fast,  it
moved from  the  Hanningfield  area to
over  Danbury  down   in   around  5/6
seconds at the most!"
@5
"God," I said, "that  must be at least
5/6 miles as  the  crow  flies." Kevin
added,  "Bugger me, that's  a  mile  a
second, it's impossible,  are  you two
pratts having us on"?

Roger Brame and Peter Phillips assured
us that they  weren't,  and  what they
had seen  was  true.  The  four  of us
continued to  observe  the  object for
several  minutes   then   the   object
started to move.

It seemed to  turn  colour,  to a very
bright  white  and  raised  vertically
what appeared  to  be  several hundred
feet, it turned to face towards us and
Chelmsford town and accelerated making
no noise at all.

In less  than  4/6  seconds  it  speed
through the sky, over our building and
was gone.
@5
I remember we all raced to the windows
on the other side  of  the building to
see if  we  could  view  where  it was
heading to, but  there  was no further
sight of it. I  can also remember that
we were all physically  shaken by what
we had  all  seen.  It  was  not until
several cups of  coffee and cigarettes
were consumed did we calm down.

We made enquiries at Essex Police H.Q.
less than half a mile away and also at
nearby Stanstead  Airport  but  to  no
avail.

There were no  scheduled  fights in or
out of Stanstead  at  that early time,
nor had Essex Police  seen  or had any
reports from any members of the public
about similar sightings.

The day shift took the micky out of us
when they come  on  at  8.00am to take
over, and suggested  that  we all must
have been on the  drink all night. The
more  we  told  the   story  the  more
embarrassing it become.

The local papers got  hold of the news
and wanted  to  interview  us  for the
story, but the  A.A.'s Public Relation
Dept. put a block  on it. Looking back
after  many  years  I  can  see  their
point.  After  all  it  wouldn't  have
looked too good, would it?

"FOUR AA MEN  SEE  FLYING  SAUCER WIZZ
AROUND CHELMSFORD."
@5
The motoring public  would think twice
about joining the  AA  when  there are
four nutters on duty at night!

So what did the  four  of  us see that
early morning? and why did no one else
see it too? Your  guess  is as good as
ours!

If the  object  had  moved  at  normal
speeds then  we  may  have  viewed  an
airship,  helecoptor   or   some   jet
aircraft. But we  DIDN'T,  it  was far
too big and moved far too fast.....

Only one  thing  still  puzzles  me to
this day?

When  the  object   turned,  and  flew
directly at, and  over  us,  you would
think that even in the very brief time
it took to  get  from  Danbury down to
Chelmsford that  it  would  appear  to
grow larger in  size as it approached?

It didn't, it  remained  THE SAME SIZE
all the time !!!!!!!!
