WoW!   Two handy utilities in 1 issue!  Come to think of it!  How many  Disk
Magazines can you think of that give you so many free Programs?

                                  Re-Boot v2@1
                                  ----------
@5
Are you fed up using the@1 "Vulcan Death Grip" ( A-A-Ctrl keys)@5 to reboot your
Amiga?  Perhaps your Hands are not as nimble as they once were and you  find
this difficult! Perhaps like me your just Plain Lazy! Then this is the Ideal
utility for you.


After installing@1 (And please read the Doc First ....in HTML format, So use a
Browser)@5  you can Re-Boot your Amiga by selecting@4 "Re-Boot"@5 from the@3 "Tools"
@5Menu in Workbench. To be on the safe side@4 "Re-Boot"@5 asks you is you WANT to
Re-Boot  before performing the action,  Thus giving you the option  to  Quit
before you lose all that valuable Information in Ram etc.





The  Author Francis Loch@7 (Member of G.A.U.G)@5  has kindly granted the @2 RIPPER
@5his  conscent  to  disrtibute this Utility.  If you use the  program  PLEASE
contact Francis and let him know either by email or Postcard. Address in the
program Docs.

         Re-Boot can be found on disk 2 of this issue of the Ripper!
