After  the announcement by Amiga Inc of the spec of the developers  machine,
an  AMD  K6-2/500 based pc,  with a Linux OS hosting elate,  a lot of  users
have  been mumbling about the amiga having finally been killed off  I  would
like to air my point of view.

                   The Amiga`s dead@1....@3long live the Amiga!
@5
Yes it`s true,  the @1"classic"@5 amiga may be on it`s last legs,  but with  the
development  of a new @1"Next Generation Amiga"@5 the@1 "Amiga Spirit"@5  will  live
on.   Lets face it,  we are stuck with outdated early 90`s based technology,
time has left us standing still,  our machine has not advanced in nearly  10
years  while  the PC and Mac have become pretenders to the throne.   It  has
become necessary to make a radical step,  a painfull step which will see the
@1"Amiga Spirit"@5 again come to the forefront of computing!



People  are  complaining that the Dev Box is a PC,  but it does  not  matter
what  the  development  machine is,  after  all  the  original  Amigas  were
designed and developed on PC`s,  the point is we have a@3 DEVELOPMENT@5 machine,
one  on  which  companies@3 AND USERS@5 can write new  software  for  the  final
Consumer machine,  the real@1 "NG Amiga"@5.  This machine is needed@2 NOW@5  because
when  the  consumer machine comes out it will have to have a full  range  of
various  types  of software,  no-one will buy it if it  does  not  have  any
software to run on it!
@3
      I AM GLAD@5 that this machine has been produced, and@3 SO SHOULD YOU!
@5
If  you write software for the current amiga then I`m sure you will be  more
than  interested in maybe developing for the NG amiga,  as this machine  has
been aimed at you,  so get it and give the PC & Mac users something to drool
over!
