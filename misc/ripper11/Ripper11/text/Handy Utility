As  always!  In the disk version of the@2 Ripper@5 we try to bring you an up  to
date and useful tool to improve you usage of the Amiga! In this issue we are
pleased  to  offer  our readers a@1 Scientific Calculator@5 program  written  by
@3Donald McMillan@5, One of our dear friends from the@4 Glasgow Amiga User Group.
@5
Certainly the standard Workbench offers you a Simplistic Calculator  that  can
be used for the Basic functions of Adding or Subtracting etc.  However Donalds
wonderful  little program offers you the opportunity to do so much  more.   If
like  me  you  have  children at School or College,   Now  you  can  use  your
@1"Outdated"@5 and@1 "aged"@5 Computer to help them with their studies.

The  Calculator Program can be found in its own Drawer on Disk 2.  Simply drag
it to your desired location on your hard drive, and click on the Icon to use.
Calculator  is  freely available from the Aminet,  and is  supplied  to  Amiga
users as@1 "E-Mail Ware"
@5
If you find this program useful, They please either send Donald an e-mail or
letter to his address@3 (In the Calculator Docs)
