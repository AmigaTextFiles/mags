This program is the fifth that I have written with a GUI.
It is one of the programs I have set myself to write to
gain practice in doing this.

View the Amigaguide document for more information.

Instructions:
If you don't know how to work a calculator then don't use this
program. If you do, then try it out.
All of the available buttons work as required.
You can also enter calculations on the keyboard and use RETURN
or ENTER as equals. The takeback '<-' button deletes the last entry,
its keyboard equivalent is BACKSPACE. Any other key is ignored.
As always, don't forget my trademark 'About' menu item.

Legal:
This program hardly requires it, but I should start as I mean
to go on and so:
This program is Emailware.
In the event that you find this program useful, send me an email.

Calculator is provided 'as is' and the author cannot be held responsible
for any damage occurred as a result of running this program.
(I would hope that none of my programs cause any damage).

The latest version of this legal section supersedes any previous versions.

Calculator is (C) Copyright DWM Productions ie. Donald W Millican
The whole program cannot be changed and redistributed without my
consent. This document may be updated for any re-release but the
legal section must remain unchanged.
The program can be spread anywhere but I request that all the files
be kept together including all of this document.

Programmer: (ie. the person who came up with a good idea and turned it
into a wonderful program.)
