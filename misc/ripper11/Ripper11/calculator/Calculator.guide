@node part1 "What is it?"



            Calculator is unsurprisingly - a calculator. It performs all
            of the functions of an ordinary calculator.
            It also performs some more advanced functions.

            To discover why I created Calculator click @{"here" link part5}.

            If you want to run it you'll want to know the @{"system requirements" link part2}.

            Or jump straight to @{"usage" link part4} for instructions on
            how to access the program.

@node part4 "How to use the program"

            Numbers can be entered by typing them on the keyboard or clicking
            their buttons on the screen - the same goes for the add, multiply,
            etc., buttons.

            The RETURN and ENTER buttons can be used instead of the equals key.

            If a mistake in entry is made, use the button marked '<-'. This is
            the takeback button and will delete your previous entries in the
            display. The keyboard shortcut for this button is BACKSPACE.

            Any other keypresses will be ignored.

            The C button will clear the current calculation.

            NOTE: If ten numbers are entered plus one decimal and the decimal
            is then removed, it will disappear but the rest of the numbers will
            not jump backwards to fill the space. Your number will end in '.0'.
            This does not affect the calculation in any way so please ignore it.
            Occasionally, the display may contain '-0', again this is harmless.

                            @{b}@{u}The Scientific window@{uu}@{ub}

            To open this window, activate the menus and choose the first option.
            A window will appear, for the moment on top of the calculator.
            It contains several buttons. They can be used in normal calculations
            just like other buttons although they may not work in some situations
            (like choosing the square button when nothing has been entered).

            Currently the bracket buttons are non-operational but may work
            in future releases.

@node part5 "Why did I create it?"

    I know that many other programs similar to mine already exist.
    I decided that I wanted a challenging project to work on so I decided
    to create a calculator. It was an awful lot harder than I thought -
    looking at the program @{"history" link part7} will tell you that.

    The reason that my previous version 1.0 release of the calculator
    largely didn't work and because of this was released as source code,
    was that I simply hadn't realised how complex the workings of a
    calculator really are. I am still learning.

    As you will notice if you run the calculator, it now has some extra
    functions. I have hoped from the beginning that functions such as
    square, square root and pi could be added. Other functions,
    e.g. sine, cosine, tangent, brackets, etc. are coming soon.
