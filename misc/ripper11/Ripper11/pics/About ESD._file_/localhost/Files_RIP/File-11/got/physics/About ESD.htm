                             How Charges Build Up
@4
Static  electricity  is generated by unbalancing the molecular  construction
of  relatively  non-conductive insulators such as plastics and  paper.   All
matter is composed of atoms.  A balanced atom contains positive charges that
are present in the nucleus of the atom.  An equal amount of negative charges
orbits  this nucleus in the form of electrons.  Both charges are equal  and,
therefore,  the overall charge of a balanced atom is zero.  However,  should
this  configuration  be disturbed and several electrons  removed  from  this
atom  (e.g.   rubbing two materials together),  we end  up  with  a  greater
positive  charge in the nucleus and a deficiency of electrons,  which  gives
you an overall charge in the positive direction.  Conversely,  should we add
a  few extra electrons,  we have an overall charge of negative,  due to  the
fact  that we now have an excess of electrons and the net charge is  now  in
the negative direction.

                    How ESD Affects Electronic Components
@4
Picture a man welding a piece of metal.  There are two cables that come from
the welder;  one is positive and one is negative.  The workman attaches  the
negative  cable  to the metal he wants to weld,  and the positive  cable  is
attached to the welding rod in his handpiece.  As he places the welding  rod
near  the metal he wants to weld,  the electrical charge leaps from the  rod
to  the metal and creates an arc.  This arc is hot enough to melt the metal,
and the weld is made.  Now imagine the inside of an electronic component, an
integrated circuit,  for example.  There are all kinds of metal wires  which
allow  the  component  to  function.  All the  internal  conductors  of  the
component  are near the same level of charge,  so there can be no  discharge
or damage.  However, when a human with a charge touches his finger to a lead
of  the  component,  the charge travels from his body into one of the  wires
leading  to  the  inside of the component.  When it gets  near  metal  of  a
different charge,  the electrostatic energy creates an arc, leaping from one
component to the next.  Now granted,  this arc inside the integrated circuit
is very small,  but the metal parts in there are equally small.  The arc  in
the  component acts much as the one with the welder,  melting or  vaporizing
some  of  the  metal  in the part.  This can cause the metal  parts  in  the
component to 'short' together,  or to be blown away completely. When an ESD-
damaged  component  is dissected and the area of the ESD event  photographed
with  an  electron microscope,  the damage to the inside  of  the  component
looks  exactly  like the effect of the welder on the  metal  that  has  been
welded.   However,  not all ESD damage is this obvious.  When an  electronic
component has been destroyed by an ESD event,  it is fairly simple (  though
expensive )  to isolate the bad part and replace it.  A far greater  problem
occurs  when a component has been damaged,  but still functions.  While  the
machine or product is still at the factory,  it works perfectly.  But,   the
ESD  damage  to the components inside may cause a failure days,  weeks,   or
even months later.  Many times a factory may not be aware that it has an ESD
problem  until  they  notice a high level of their products  being  returned
when they originally worked fine.

                        How The Charges Can Be Avoided@2

                                  GROUNDING@4
It  is possible to disturb the molecular construction of your operator.   As
ridiculous  as  this sounds,  if an operator is isolated by  standing  on  a
wooden  floor or wearing crepe rubber soles,  he will soon pick up a voltage
gradient.  For example,  it is possible for an operator to charge to several
hundred  volts  each  time he handles a piece of  charged  plastic.   As  he
handles  many different pieces,  he will become charged to a higher  voltage
gradient  until a flash-over will occur and the operator receives  a  shock,
or  damages a static sensitive device.  This can be prevented by having your
operator  stand  on  a grounded conductive mat or by the  use  of  personnel
grounding equipment that is commercially available and by ionization.


@4
Personnel  grounding  equipment becomes  important  if  your  operators  are
sitting  while working.  This is the best means of isolating operators  and,
therefore,   they  become extremely vulnerable to static  discharge  due  to
charging.  This phenomenon can be related to an individual dragging his feet
on  the  living  room rug and then discharging himself by  touching  a  well
grounded lamp.

In addition,  grounding of all your plant machinery and related equipment is
most  important.   It  never ceases to amaze us  that  so  many  plants  are
operating machinery that is not grounded electrically.  Besides  the  safety
factor,   a grounded machine will help drain off extremely high  charges  of
static electricity from partial conductors.  Remember,  grounding is only an
aid to reducing your problems with static electricity. It is not a solution.

For example,  grounding your operators will not drain off static electricity
from their clothing.  Also,  it will not drain off static electricity from a
plastic container one maybe holding.  The conductivity of some clothing  and
most  plastics  is so low that electricity cannot flow to a ground;   hence,
"static electricity." To solve this problem, ionization must be utilized.

                                  INDUCTION@4

Removing  or  neutralizing static electricity by induction is  the  simplest
and  oldest  method.  Tinsel is the most common tool for  this  application.
However,   tinsel  is  oftentimes misused and,  therefore,   oftentimes  not
successful.  The first thing that must be recognized is the  fact  that  any
induction  device,  such as tinsel,  will never reduce or neutralize  static
electricity  to the zero potential level.  This is due to the  fact  that  a
threshold  or beginning voltage is required to "start" the process.   First,
the  correct induction equipment must be utilized.  If you are using tinsel,
it  must  have  a  metal  core.  We have seen tinsel  with  a  string  (non-
conductive)   core being utilized.  This type of tinsel  will  not  function
properly.  Second, the tinsel must be well grounded electrically. Third, the
tinsel  must be stretched tight and placed 1/4 of an inch from the  material
to  be  neutralized.   Fourth,  there must be "free  air  space"  under  the
material to be neutralized directly under or over the spot where  you  place
the  tinsel.   In this fashion the tinsel will reduce static electricity  on
both sides of the static laden material.






Actually,  if the above steps are utilized,  the sharp ends or points of the
grounded  induction  device  will ionize the  air  over  the  surface  being
neutralized,   because  the  grounded  sharp  ends  are  placed  within  the
electrostatic  field  that  is present due to static  electricity.   If  the
static  charge is negative in polarity,  the electrostatic field is negative
and  positive  ions  are  generated via  the  grounded  sharp  ends  of  the
induction  device and the positive ions are attracted  back  to  the  static
laden  surface.  Conversely,  if the static charge is positive in  polarity,
negative  ions  will  be  generated by the grounding  induction  device  and
attracted back to the charged area.

                                 CONDUCTIVITY
@4
The  ability  of  material  to  surrender its  electrons  or  absorb  excess
electrons  is  purely a function of the conductivity of  the  material  with
which you are working.  For example, a pure conductor, such as copper, has a
rigid molecular construction that will not permit its electrons to be  moved
about freely.  However,  as you approach the semi-conductor range,  such  as
some  bond  papers,  the ability of this material to surrender its electrons
is  relatively easy and can be accomplished by friction,  heat or  pressure.
As  you approach the purely non-conductive materials,  such as plastics,  it
is  extremely  easy  to  disrupt the molecular construction  and  cause  the
material to charge with the slightest friction,  heat or pressure.   If  the
conductivity of your processed material can be controlled,  then, preventing
static  electricity becomes relatively easy.  For example,   adding  surface
conductivity  to  plastics will move them up into  the  higher  conductivity
range  and  prevent the build up of static electricity  that  is  caused  by
friction.   This  is  normally accomplished by  use  of  additives  such  as
moisture and anti-static sprays.  The average anti-static spray is  made  up
from  a soap based material that's been diluted in a solvent,  such as  mild
alcohol.   A fire retardant is added to combat flammability of the  solvent,
then pressure and Freon ® are added,  and you have your aerosol can of anti-
static spray.  As this spray leaves the nozzle of the aerosol can,  the  two
Freons  normally used evaporate immediately.  A short time after  con-  tact
with  your material,  the fire retardant and solvents evaporate leaving  you
with  a conductive coating on the surface of the material.  The plastic  has
now become conductive and as long as this coating is not disturbed,  it will
be difficult to generate static electricity in this material.
