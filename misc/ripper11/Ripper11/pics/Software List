http://kickstart.amiga.tm


News: New Layout

We've  had a slight change in layout this month and added some new  features
so you don't get bored with a plain old price list! Talking about boring, we
were  thinking about changing the Subject Title of this mailing  to  reflect
the  fact  that  we have expanded beyond a straight price  list.   Our  best
suggestion  so  far has been "Amiga Fore-Matt" which  I  must  admit  has  a
somewhat familiar ring to it! Tell us what you think to that or send us your
suggestion.

Anyway,  you will already have noticed our new contents feature which allows
you  to  see  where everything is going to appear so you can quickly  scroll
down to something of interest if you wish.  The CD and disk price lists have
switched places for those that want to quickly jump in and get a price, with
most of you mainly interested in the CD prices.

For some time now we have been providing a Game Chart to various print, disk
and web magazines and we have decided it may be of use to you as well so  we
have  now put it at the bottom of the mailing for those that are interested.
Also,   for the non-gamers we have a utility chart showing the best  selling
utilities in Europe through GTI.  All GTI chart items are available to order
from FORE-MATT Home Computing (an official GTI partner).

Finally,  our Nightlong build up and preview will soon be completed as  will
the game which will be the biggest game ever produced for the Amiga!

Coming soon: NIGHTLONG

Year 2099

Progress continuously advances like an unstoppable giant of Steel. The flat
lives of people slowly fade inside jam-packed cities like Union, capital of
the new nation.

Everything lies in the grip of an eternal paralysis, predicated like gospel
from Multinational Corporations. Only those who belong to the elite have
learned about arts and sciences, matter and soul.

States are nothing but flags, soldiers defending a civilization that is not
civil
anymore. Cyberspace has made his appearance to save the citizens from
averyday reality. It is a virtual network, generated from the fusion of all
digital connections of the last millenium.

Many Multinationals see this non-existent space as an ideal resort for their
business meetings and research communities.

Cyberspace can offer you anything: leisure, travels, friends you never had
and dreams you never dreamt. Drugs are its natural organic brainchild.

Recently a company has announced the inauguration of its latest "Neural-
Navigation System", with a slogan that proclaims "full reality in virtual
experiences"...

The Last sunrays are gone now, and the warm breeze of June's night somehow
weakens the miasma that people here call air.

In the desolation of the Union Industrial Borderland, Joshua Reeve,
ex-lietenant of the military services, is silently waiting for the arrival
of his new client.

He's not here for the money anyway. It's just that an old debt has to be
paid
back.

His wait is interrupted by the landing manoeuvre of a luxurious Limousine,
the car of his former captain Hugh Martens. It is strange, the taste in your
mouth when you're going to meet the man who saved your life. It's like
savouring your own blood.

"Hi Hugh" Joshua gets into the limousine. The door automatically closes
after him.

"Joshua, it's been a long time..."

"Too long. What's the score?"

Nowadays Martens is Union City's mayor, but his popularity seems to be going
rapidly downhill. The reason is directly connected to the attacks of a group
of terrorists, who have targeted the most important industrial installations
in the city, including the Genesis Cryogenic Enterprise, who is no less than
Martens' electoral sponsor.
