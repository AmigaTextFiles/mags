                   Getting to grips with SCALA, part three!*1@1
                   ----------------------------------------

@3
This  month,  we will be concluding our little tutorial on scala.  If you  are
interested in a more in-depth tutorial on scala,  let us know,   and  we @1 (I?)
@3will do more on this subject.

                             What we done so far@1
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@3

We created a script,  with buttons,  fades, sound and music. This time we will
start  a  more "involved" involved way to create a multimedia show.  It  might
look  like  a bit of work to begin with,  but it helps keeping stuff organised
once you're done with it.

If you make a @1(semi)@3professional presentation,  you might want to come back to
it later,  to change only parts of it. As with all computer related things, it
helps to put a bit of planning into this subject.  A great help in Scala,   is
to  be  able to have many different scripts linked to one.  What do I mean  by
this?  Well,  let me clarify this with an example.  For one  of  the  shows  I
created,  I have one index page.  Here are all buttons calling other  scripts.
If I need to alter one script,  I don't have to alter everything. The script I
wrote  for  my  local Opel dealer @1(would be Vauxhall in the UK,   the  General
Motors  thing)@3,  lists all their different cars.  Now,  the index script  just
lists  some  options to help you search for what you are looking for.   Listed
here are all the makes of cars they have,  as simple buttons.  The way to  set
this up has been described in the previous parts of the tutorial.

                                     How?@1
                                     ~~~~@3
Actually,  once you sussed the basics,  this is a pretty easy thing to do. You
still  set  up  your main page with buttons and all,  but you  don't  let  the
buttons  call another page.  Instead,  when choosing what a button should  do,
you  let  it  run  another script.  In my example,  I have the button @1 "Astra"
@3linked  to  a script called@1 "Astra.script"@3.  This Astra script has  all  pages
concerning the Opel@1 (Vauxhall)@3  Astra. There's a page on different engines, on
extras,  different models,  colours etc. Now, two years ago GM came with a new
Astra.  I didn't have to change my entire script,  but only the Astra  Script.
The main page is still the same,  all other pages and links are untouched,  so
nothing can go wrong if I only change this one script.











@4
                                 Advantages?@1
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~@3
The first advantage is that your presentation will remain similar in look  and
feel,  even if you change one script. The core of the script remains the same.
Furthermore,   you save on precious memory when playing the  script,   because
scala  will  only  load the script in memory that it is  executing.   So,   on
startup,  it only loads the start page,  if you click the button@1 "Astra"@3,   it
will only load the Astra script,  and so on. With the chip-mem restrictions on
Amiga you still have to be very careful with your memory!  Last but not least,
it saves you a lot of work!







@4
                              Some general tips@1
@3                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just to make life easier for you,  here's some general tips.  First, don't use
many  colours,  when few will do.  A 16 colour background will do most of  the
times,   and  you should try never to use more than 32 colours  in  a  script.
Again,   this saves on memory.  Use PPaint for some quality colour  reduction,
and  you  won't notice the difference.  Scala also has the option to  optimise
the palette when you load a brush,  so that you can get good results with  few
colours.  Second, don't let your script run to pagenumbers, or first page/last
page.  This is asking for problems,  if you later decide to add/remove  pages.
Instead,  give all your pages a name,  and let your script call the  pages  by
name.   No matter how many pages you insert,  the name will always remain  the
same,  so you will always load the correct page.  Third:  Don't overdo it with
fonts/effects/sounds.  It might look great to show of what  you  can  do  with
your Amiga,  but it won't keep the customer watching for a long time. Stick to
a  few  clear  fonts,  a select number of wipes,  and keep it  simple!   Last:
Experiment with all options.  Ask if you run into problems, enjoy the program,
and be creative!
