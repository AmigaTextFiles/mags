   Making money with your Amiga*2@1
   ============================                         
@5
So,   you  decided to read  this  bit?
That  means that either  you  want  to
make money using your Amiga,  you have
nothing  better to do than read  this,
or  you are already making money  with
your  Amiga,   and want  to  see  what
mistakes  I  make   in  writing  this!
Allow me to put your mind at ease:   I
will  make  mistakes in this  article!
If  you  are expecting a@4 "get rich  in
two  weeks"@5 scheme from this  article,
you'd  better stop reading right  now.
But,   since you most likely  have  an
Amiga,   why not put it to  good  use,
and  try and make a little money  with
it?

         Ways to make money@1
         ------------------




*2@5
There  are various ways to make  money
with your Amiga. When I talk to people
about it,  a response I often get  is:
@3"But  I  don't  know the  first  thing
about programming!"@5 Well,  here's  the
good news, you don't have to! In fact,
one  of  the ways you are most  likely
not to make money on the Amiga,  is by
programming.  The market is so  small,
that  only   some   shareware  authors
actually   make   money   with   their
software,  and most of the time hardly
enough  to even justify the work  they
do!   In order to make some real money
programming on the Amiga,   you  would
need  to  write a program  no-one  has
ever  thought  of  before,   or  write
something  a lot better than  existing
programs.  Other than that,  you would
need   the   marketing   resources  to
compete with the@3 "big names"@5.  Only  a
select  few will ever make money  that
way,   but hey,  you might be  one  of
them!   A  better way to start  making
money,   is  by   using  the  existing
software,   and work with  that.   You
need creativity to do that,  and a lot
of time.  You also need to not give up
the first time something goes wrong!
@3
       Investigate the market@1
       ----------------------
@5
Before  you  start   setting  up  your
company,   you   should  look  at  the
market!  What can you do,  that nobody
else  is  offering in your  area,   or
where you can stay under the price  of
other  offerings? There are a  lot  of
areas  where you can use  your  Amiga:
you could make multimedia shows, video
presentations,  you can do  DTP  work,
and so on.  Whatever you choose,  make
sure  it is something you like to  do,
and something you are good at. It does
help if you get the honest opinion  of
friends on your work before you  start
your  business.  Sure,  you think  you
can do miracles with graphics,  but if
all   your   friends   say   they  are
average,  don't count on making  money
with it.  It also pays to read  up  on
what  it is you want to do.  Get  some
books  from  your   local  library  on
whatever  it is you want to  do,   and
read them.
@3
        Get the right tools@1
        -------------------
@5
After  you  decided what you  want  to
do,  think about what you need  to  do
it.  This may sound obvious,  but  you
need  to @3 "count the cost"@5 before  you
start  your work.  Make an exact  list
of  all items you need to get started.
First,  you need to think of  all  the
software you might need.  This can  be
more than you think of at first.   For
instance,  you might want to  start  a
DTP service.  Of course,  you need DTP
software,   which at  this  point  can
only  be PageStream.  But,  you  would
also  need   some   image-manipulation
software,  a structured art program, a
paint program.  And while we're at it,
you might want some fax software,   so
that you can make your layout,  fax it
to  your  customer,  he  can  ask  for
changes,  and you can all do  it  from
your Amiga.  Get STFax,  you can  even
put on some samples of your work,  and
put  them  up  as fax on  demand,   so
people  can  look   at  your  work  by
simply  asking for it  per  fax.   You
could  also put a pricelist  up  as  a
fax.   After this,  you need to  think
about hardware.  Of course, first your
Amiga  needs to be ready for  all  the
work  you  throw at it.  Get  as  much
memory  as  you can afford,   get  the
fastest processor you can afford,  get
a graphics card.  Get a modem, and get
connected with the rest of the  world.
Get   a   CD-Rom   drive,    a   large
harddrive,   a  large  backup  storage
device@1 (CD-Write,  ZIP)@5. Does this put
you  off yet? Sorry,  but if you  want
to make money, you would first have to
invest some money!  If you have a real
good idea,  you might want to try  and
talk  your  bank manager  into  giving
you a loan,  but you need to make darn
sure that you will be able to pay  him
back.  We'll get to the bank stuff  in
a  minute.  First,  there is some more
money you should spend!  A must  have,
if  you're planning to spend a lot  of
time  with  your Amiga,  is  a  decent
monitor!  Not only will this make your
work  look better on screen,   but  it
will  indeed  help you  keep  healthy.
Your eyesight is to precious to loose!
For the same reason,  you need to make
sure  you  have a place to work  where
there  is  enough light.  You  need  a
good desk,  and more importantly,  you
need  a  good  chair.  Your  desk  and
chair need to be high enough for  you,
you  need to have enough place on your
desk.  Don't go cheap on those  items,
it  might not seem important now,  but
after  two  years behind  your  Amiga,
you will thank me for this advise @1 (or
curse  yourself   because  you  didn't
listen)@5.  Last but not least,  there's
hardware  peripherals you might  need.
For  DTP work,  you would need a  good
printer.  Sure, the finished work will
go  to a print service,  but you  need
to  have  a   good   idea   from  your
homeprinter,  as to how the final work
will  look.  For most work,  you  need
some  devices  to  get  graphics  into
your  Amiga.   Think  scanner,   think
digital cameras,  think loads of money

          Getting the money@1
          -----------------
@5
You  might be a more lucky person than
I am.  Maybe Bill Gates is your uncle,
or you are very rich.  You could share
your money with me of course,  or  you
could  use  your money to  start  your
business. If this is not the case, you
might  want to consider the bank.   If
you  catch your bank manager in a good
mood,  he might actually help you  get
started.  If you decide to  try  this,
you  MUST  have  your plan  of  action
ready  before   you  go  to  the  bank
manager.   You must have  investigated
the  market,  know how much money  you
need,   and have a realistic  plan  of
action,  so that the bank manager  can
be  convinced  that you  pay  him  the
money   back!    Something   else   to
consider,   depending on what  country
you  live,   is help from  the  state.
What  do you pay taxes for? A  lot  of
countries help people who start  there
own  business,   by giving  them  some
money  to start with.  They might  not
help  you,  but it can't hurt to  ask.
Again,  present them with  a  plan  of
action.  Just saying you have a  great
idea won't get you much money.

   Seperate pleasure from business@1
   -------------------------------
@5
When you start your business,  try and
find  a  way  to  keep  your  personal
money    is   seperated   from    your
@3"business"@5 money.  Make sure you, as a
person,  will not have to pay if  your
business doesn't go as expected.  Here
in  Germany  one would maybe  start  a
GmbH,   as  it is called,   where  the
private  money is not touched  when  a
business doesn't make it.  You  should
get  more information on this at  your
trade  chambers or whatever they  call
them where you live!


@3
        Setting a price point@1
        ---------------------
@5
In  setting  a  price  point  for  the
product you want to offer,  don't just
think  of  the money you  invested  in
it,  but think ahead. You should count
on  your  computer burning  up,   your
printer  exploding,  your scanner  get
outdated,    your   software   getting
outdated,  and all new stuff you  need
to  buy should come from the money you
earn.   Count on it that you  have  to
replace your entire set-up every  five
years,     and   set    your    prices
accordingly.

             Conclusion@1
             ----------
@4
All  of the above make it sound as  if
you would be taking quite some risk if
you  want  to  make  money  with  your
Amiga,   and  this is true.   It  also
sounds  like there is some  hard  work
involved,  and again,  this  is  true.
Setting  up  your  own  business  like
this   is   nothing   for   the  faint
hearted,  but it can be done,  and you
can  make money with it.  What it  all
boils  down  to,   is planning,   more
planning,  some planning, and loads of
hard  work.  If you are not afraid  of
this,  you might want to try it. It is
great  fun  if  you  succeed  in  your
business.  Of course, you can start on
a  small  scale,  by,   for  instance,
printing         small        business
card/newsletters   for   friends   and
family.  This would have the advantage
that  the intitial outlay  is  not  as
big,  but the disadvantage is that the
profit you can make will never  be  as
big.  Still, it would be a good start,
if  you  think you want to start  with
making  some  money.   Ask  around  at
local  stores,  you might be surprised
to  find  that some will actually  pay
you    to     make     their    weekly
advertisements in pagestream!
