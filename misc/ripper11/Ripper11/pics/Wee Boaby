small but busy Cafetria/Bar.
@4
                    Lets go there Boaby! ...It looks nice!
@5
As  they  walked over to one of the tables this Swarthy Spanish Fella  in  a
Blue Jacket ran over to them.@6

                          Olla! Olla! You sit here!

Customers!

@4
OH!  Lovely said Ella ....Innit Boaby?@5 she said giving the Wee Man a dig  in
the Ribs.

However Boaby was more concerned that the Spanish waiter had just arrived at
the table and was looking at him Expectedly!
@3
Aye!   Right Jimmy .....Geez a Pint oh Heavy fur masel and a Wee Orange  fur
the strife here!
@5
The  Waiter  stood  blinking at him!  and then  looked  at  Ella  and  Nigel
#1
                                  <@1confused#1>
@7
Mmm! Excuse me again@5 said Nigel,@7 But they don't serve Pints in Tenerife and
certainly not Scottish beer! I would suggest you try the local Brew.
@5
                     Then looking at the Waiter he said:
@7
                One Dorada and a glass of Orange Juice Please!
@6

@3
Oh! AYE! Nigel Newgent frae Newark should keep his "NEB" oot oh ma Business!
@5
Before Ella could reprimand the Wee man for his Manners the Waiter returned!

The  Waiter smiled:  Placed a large glass of fresh Orange in front of  Ella,
Then turned to Boaby and deposited ....What to the Wee Man ....Looked like a
Test  tube  ...Then he poured a small splash of beer into the  glass  before
placing the bottle on the table and disappearing back into the crowd!
@3
Whit  the  Buggering  Hell is he playin at? @5asked Boaby  ...Staring  at  the
dribble of beer in the bottom of his testtube!

Naughty Nigel!  Steps in again!@7  Oh thats how they serve you over here! They
just  pour  a  small sample of beer into your glass to ensure that  its  not
flat, Try it I think you will find it rather pleasent!
@5
Boaby lifted the Bottle to his lips and took a large Swallow ...@3Well it's no
to bad he said returning the Bottle to the Table, But its no hella big.
@7
Well  said  the  everknowing Nigel if you require another  refreshment  just
raise your arm in the air and he will return!
@5
Wee Boaby looked at ELLA and stuck his arm up in the Air ....Sure enough the
waiter  flew  over ....Picked up the Empty Bottle rushed  off  and  returned
seconds later with a refill.
@3
BRILLIANT!   @5Said  Boaby  liftin the Bottle to his  lips!   ...Draining  the
Contents and raising his arm again!
@3
Here!   Ella  @5said Boaby ...After his fifth Bottle ....@3Yon daft  Dago  oh  a

how they make any profit!
@5
In  Pops Nigel#1 << @7Oh!  they will serve you all night ...But you get the bill
before you leave....Then you settle up with the owner!
@3
Oh! @5  said the Wee man slightly disappointed ....@3They wouldn't get  aff  wie
that in Glasga pubs!
@5
Two more bottles quickly disappeared down Boaby's throat before Ella decided
it  was time to return to the flat,  She beckoned the Waiter and settled the
bill!
@4
                  Right come oan Boaby lets get up the road!
@5
Boaby pushed himself off the Plastic chair and immediately fell flat on  his
face!
@4
                 Christ! are yea all right Boaby?@5 asked Ella
@3
Off course am no all right@5 shouted Boaby....@3Some dirty Baztart hiz stolen ma
legs!
@5
     Ella tried to wrestle Boaby to his feet ....Suddenly Nigel Appeared!
@7
                       Can I be of assistance?@5 he asked
@3
AYE! YEA Kin BUGGER aff and leave me alone before I put ma fit where the Sun
Don't shine!@5 Screamed Wee Boaby
@4
OH!   Christ  am affie Sorry Nigel! @5 said Ella. @4 Jist ignore him  he's  Pure
Pished!
@5
Somehow Ella managed to half carry Boaby back to the Flat and deposited  him
into the Sofa bed.

Wee Boaby slept soundly until around 3 am!  When He briefly came to,  Prised
his tongue from the Pillow ....  Arose to empty his Bladder and returned  to
the Kitchen area.  Quietly @1(So as not to waken Ella)@5  He groped around until
he found a large glass Jug,  Filled it with water from the kitchen sink, and
Drank it down in a oner!
@3
Ukk! Even the Bluddy Waters warm! @5Muttered Boaby before returning to bed and
promptly falling asleep again!

The  next time Boaby opened his eyes,  it was around 7.30am,  and he quietly
watched  Ella  Fiddling around with one of the ornaments on the  wall  unit,
Before she trotted off to the Toilet!

            Boaby was up and dressed by the time Ella had washed!
@4
OH!   Fur  Christ  sake ....We HUV the technology!  ...We CAN  rebuild  him!
...Whit a bluddy state you wer in last night!
@3
Whit! @5  screamed Boaby@3 It musta been thon Nigel Poofer pit something  in  ma

@4
   Never! He wiz a Gentleman! It wiz you yea wer jist as PISHED as a FART!

Noo!  go and get ready ....We've a Boat tae catch! ...Oh! and pit the Kettle

@5
Boaby Stumbled to the kitchen and picked up the Kettle and proceeded to  the
Kitchen sink.
#4
NAW! @5 screamed Ella ....@4Dinna use the tap water ...Use the water in that big
plastic Bottle!
@3
                 Whits wrang wie the tap water?@5 Asked Boaby.
@4
       Its nae fit fur drinkin ...That why I bought the bottled water!
@3
Bought?...Bottled? Jeezs Christ don't tell me yer wastin Money buying Bluddy
Water! It no even fermented fur Godsake!
@5
Shaking  his head in disbelief Boaby filled the Kettle from a large  plastic
Bottle and headed for the Toilet.

30  Minutes later Boaby and Ella were standing at the Bus stop out side  the
shop they had visited the Previous night.
@4
  It's excitin init Boaby!...A kin hardly wait tae see thon Whales@5 said Ella


@3
Christ there just big fishy things!  wie a six inch layer oh Blubber  and  a
hole at the top oh their heid! ....Come tae think oh it! It sounds mair like

@4
                        Sshh! Said Ella There the bus!
@3
Fur  Christ sake! @5 Said Boaby@3 I've seen better rejects at the bottom oh  the
pile at Shuggie Broons ScrapYard.
@4
Ssshh!  Come oan!@5 Shouted Ella ...and they clambered aboard the Ricketty old
vehicle!

Boaby  and  Ella  headed up to the Back seat,  and  after  around  20  other
tourists had boarded the Bus took off. Rattling and Bumping down the  Narrow
streets.

The Bus driver seemed to have perfected the Art of driving with one hand out
the window....Gesturing to other drivers and the other placed permanently on
the horn ...Presumably steering with his knees!

Twenty long uncomfortable minutes later the Bus pulled up at a small  docks,
The MAD Driver stood...Smiling at the front of the Vehicle with his hand out
stretched expectantly!
@4
                Ah think he's expectin a tip Boaby!@5 said Ella.
@3
I'll  Tip the Bad Mastard in the bluddy harbour!...He musta learnt tae drive
on a Elephant or somethin.
@4
            OH! BOABY......LOOK BOABY!....Look at the Bonnie Boat!
@3
Ah!  Fur Christ sake ....It's bluddy ancient!  ...It's probably crawlin  wie
WidWorm! ...Weel be lucky tae get oot oh the Harbour.
@4
   Seeesh! ...Come oan lets get aboard.@5 said Ella with Mounting excitement.

Boaby  and  Ella joined the rest of the Passingers aboard the  "Old  Sailing
Ship" and 10 minutes later the "Crew" Hoisted the Sails.
@4
                   Oh Look Boaby ....Were Aff!@5 shouted Ella
@3
Whit  dae yea Mean wer Aff? They Bluddy sails are tiny and there nae even  a
breath oh Wind!
@5
Suddenly  with a Roar two Marine Engines burst into life and the Ship  edged
away from the Dockside.
@3
             "Sailin Ship my ARSE"@5 Said Boaby@3 "Ther usin Engines"
@5
As  Boaby and Ella stood at the Port side of the Ship,  looking down at  the
crystal clear water, Boaby's Stomach gave a loud#8 "RUMBLE"
@4
                         "Whit wiz That?"@5 asked Ella
@3
"Whit?" ...."How should I know?"@5 said Boaby rubbing his Stomach and  looking
puzzled.
@4
Jeez!   Boaby ....Yer Sweatin like a Pig!  ...Are yea feelin alright?@5  Asked
Ella.
@3
                "AYE ...I'm fine!...Its jist bluddy hot here"
@4
                        Well tak yer Bunnet aff then!
@3
     Nah! I'll get ma heid Burnt, The Bunnet stays!#8 <Another loud Rumble>
@4
Maybe yer Hungry!@5 Said Ella ....@4I'll go and get us a Wee sumthin tae eat and
drink ....I'll be back in a minute.
@5
      Ella Scurried of to the small area selling Rolls and fresh Orange.



Suddenly this Pain hit Boaby Squarely in the Stomach. So severe that the Wee
man doubled over, His Prized Bunnet slippin off his head and into the Water.

Boaby  couldn't take it any longer and RAN down the deck to the Small  ships
Toilet.

He JUST Managed to get in, Close the Door, Sit down and his Arse promptly
collapsed.

Five Minutes later Boaby was still sitting there Hugging his Stomach, Ella's
words ringing in his Ears #4"That's no Drinkin Water"
@5
The pain subsided, Boaby felt drained But peaceful and the gentle rocking of
the Boat, Suddenly Boaby drifted off to sleep.@1ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

#1
                         <@1Meanwhile back on deck#1>
@5
      Ella returned with a couple of Rolls and some Fresh Orange juice!
@4
       Christ wher is the Wee Bugger gone noo? @5she said looking around.


  Suddenly sumthing caught her eye! ...Boaby's Bunnet floating in the Water!
@4
OH  CHRIST!  @5 Screamed  Ella  ....@4HE'S FALLIN IN.....BOABY!   BOOOOOAAAAABY!
@5Screamed Ella ...@4HELP! HELP! MAN OVERBOARD.
@5
The  Ship engine suddenly went still and several Passingers and Crew arrived
at Ella's side.
@4
Ma Man huz fell in! @5 Said Ella ....@4Look there's his Bunnet!#4 BOOOAAABBY!@5 She
Screamed bursting into Tears.

Suddenly 3 crew members Dived into the Warm clear waters and started to swim
about.

The Captain arrived at Ella's side,  and in broken English tried to give her
words of Comfort.

10 Minutes went past before the Crew members came out of the water.  Shaking
their heads to indicate they couldn't find any sign of Boaby.
@2
            "I'm sorry!" @5said the Captain @2"We must return to Port"


@4
"OH! BOOAABY." @5Sobbed Ella, The Spanish Captain putting his large hairy arms
around her for Comfort.

              As Ella sobbed uncontrollably into his warm Chest.
#1
                             <@1Back in the Toilet#1>
@5
       The Boat now lying dead in the water, Suddenly Boaby was awake.
@3
           "Affie Quiet" @5He muttered ...@3"Musta found some Whales!"
@5
     He cleaned himself up, Re-dressed and headed out into the Sunshine.

Boaby  came accross a large crowd of Passingers all huddled on one  part  of
the Deck and slowly pushed his way through to see what they were all looking
at.

As the Wee man broke through to the Front, He could hardly beleive his Eyes!

  There Was his@1 "Bonnie Ella"@5 and a big Spannish Sailor cuddling each other!
@3
           HEY YOU!....YEA BLUDDY DAGO....GET YER PAWS AFF MY WIFE!
@5
Screamed  Boaby  launching himself accross the Deck and planting  a  perfect
@1"Glasga Kiss"@5 on the Captains Nose.
#8
                                  "WeeeacK"
@5
The  force  of  this  Headbutt was such that  the  Captain  did  a  backward
Summersault and Disappeared over the side.

Two  of the Crew Grabbed Boaby by the Arms and the third dived over the side
to Rescue the unconcious Captain.
@4
                 "BOABY"@5 Cried Ella@4 "I Thought yea wer Deid?"
@3
      "Deid! I wiz huvin a CRAP...But you didnae Waste anytime did yea?"
@4
Aaarrgh! @5 Screamed Ella! letting fly with her Handbag @4"i'll gie yea whit fur
Yea Wee Bugger!"
@5
As the bag flew through the air, Boaby lifted his legs and fell to the deck,
much  to  the surprise of the two crewmen.  The Handbag caught one  of  them
Square in the face and he fell overboard,  Knocking the other crewmember and
the Captain back into the water.


The remaining Crewman tried the grab Ella but tripped over Boaby and knocked
himself out on the deck!

Now  with all the Spannish crew either outcold or floundering in the  water,
Ella rained free and landed several Heafty kicks intae Boaby before the  two
of them were overpowered and held to the deck by the rest of the Passingers.

Eventually  the  Crewmen hauled their Outcold Captain onto  the  deck,   and
Manhandled Boaby and Ella down a flight of stairs and securely locked them
in a small dark cabin!
@4
       Och! Boaby they locked us in @5Said Ella ..@4Why did thae dae that?
@3
           I Don't bluddy know!@5 said the wee man holding his ribs.
@4
Dae  yea think they huv Kidnapped us and ur holdin us fer Ransom maybe!@5 says
Ella with a terrified look on her Face.
@3
           WHIT? ....Naw! Who the hell wid pay out a Ransom fer us?
@4
My  Mammy!  Mind she got that wee policy wi the Provie commin oot soon,  and
she  stays jist doon the road from thon Spanish Resturant ....Maybe she  let
it slip that she!s comin intae Money and they contacted their Relations over
here!
@3
Ach!  Away an no be daft Ella....Your Mither widna Part wie anything! Christ
if she hud the Measles she wouldna gie ye wan! She'll no pay any ransom.
@5
30 Minutes later,  Boaby and Ella still sitting in the Dark Cabin,  Felt the
boat giving a gentle bump and suddenly the engines went Quiet!
@4
                        Whits Happing Noo?@5 Asked Ella.

But  before  Boaby could reply the Cabin door burst open  and  in  rushed  6
heavily armed men,  Who grabbed the couple forcing then against the wall and
tying their hands behind their backs!
#4
       BOABY! @5Cried Ella @4Their Pirates....Well huv tae Walk the Plank!
@5
Suddenly the terrified couple were gagged, and bodily carried by the gang on
to  the  deck and bundled into a waiting Van which was driven  off  at  high
Speed.

10  Minutes  later  they were dragged from the van and thrown  into  another
small locked room! although this time their bonds were removed.
@3
JEZZUS  CHRIST!  @5said Boaby @3This holiday is turnin inta a bluddy  Nightmare,
How could wie no jist go tae Millport like I said?
@5
Suddenly the Room door opened and in stepped a Fair skinned man dressed in a
smart lightweight suit.
@6
   "Good Day Mr & Mrs Williamson.....I am Colin Fairlight from the Embassy"
@3
            OH THANK CHRIST! @5said Boaby @3I'm fair chokin fur a Fag!

     Colin Fairlight looked strangely at Boaby for a moment and then said

Boaby and Ella had to hand over their Watches and all monies and Jewllery to
a  big Polis Man and 30 minutes later were escorted into the back of  a  van
and taken straight on to an Aeroplane bound for Glasgow.

           Ella was sitting on the Plane softly sobbing to herself!
