Hi Pups! I is back, Old Grumble guts wouldn't let me write in the last issue
cos  he wasn't feelin to good.  Well he should have gone to the Vets like  I
told him. Anyway talking about the Vet's I member the last time I had to go!

I was lying on the couch one day,  Not feeling myself, when old Grumble guts
comes  over @5 "Mmm!  Dogs got a hot dry nose"@3 He says, @5 If  he's  not  better
tomorrow better take him to the@2 V@1--@2E@1--@2T@1--@2S.
@3
Now Excuse me here!  But you Hewmans spend a lot of time teaching us Dogs to
understand your funny speech.
@4
                                     SIT!

                                     BEG!

                                  LIE DOWN!

                                  STAAAAAY!

                                  GOOD BOY!

                                  BAD BOY !
@3
and  so on!  So why is it that if you don't want us to know something,   You
start Spelling it? Do ya all thing we are that Dum!

Anyway! a couple of days later old Grumble Guts Says@5 "Come on Domino! Let go
for a run in the car"
@3
                              WooHoo! I thought!

Now the Motor Car is one of your good inventions ....You can go for a really
long  walk  and you don't end up with all that Panting and Slobering  stuff,
You just sit there and watch the World go by.

So did we go for a nice long run?@1 NOPE!@3  Two minutes up the Road he drags me
@1(Screamming and Kicking)@3 into the Vets.

After about 10 minutes he drags me into this big room and there is this  big
Geek in a White coat and Glasses!
@7
Whats his name?@3 He says looking at me ......@5Domino!@3 says Grumble guts ...Why
not ask me I thought ....I mean I know my@1 "Buddy Name"
@5
He's not himself Vet!@3 says the old Lord and Master ...@5He's a bit OFF COLOUR.
@3
Well  I  mean to say!  I'm a Buddy Dalmation I'm supposed to be this  colour
@1<Twerp>@3 I thought!
@7
OK!@3 says the Vet ....@7Just lift him up on to the Table and i'll take a look!

                                <@4BIG MISTAKE#8>
@3
Right  lets get this clear for a Start .....I'm a @2DOG @3....Cats climb  trees,
Birdies Sit in Trees but @2DOGS@3 don't like Heights!

I mean when's the last time@2 YOU@3 saw a@2 DOG@3 up a Tree? Its not "Buddy" Natural
We are alergic to Heights!

So here I am@1 "Terrified"@3 Standing on this Table, and the VET says@7 "I'll just
check his Tempeture!
@3
WEll Look here PUPS ....Sorry and all that but when you lot go to your@2  VETS
@3when  your not well ....Do they make you Stand on a Table and then  stick  a
Glass Tube up your Bum?
#8
                                <@2I Think Not#8>
@3
And there was no Buddy way he was doing that to me Either!  So I Pressed  my
Tail as far down as I could and despite all his Efforts I kept it there.
@7
Mmm!@3 says this vet@7 "He's being a bit Stubborn, I might need to Sedate him"
@3
Well  I thought anything would be better that being Sexually Abused!  and  I
started to relax a little.
@5
                       GOOD BOY!@3 Said old Grumble Guts.

Now I ask you? What happens when you say@5 "GOOD BOY"@3 to a Dog? ....Yeah!   We
Wagg  our tails .....A Dalmation has a long and hard tail and I was  wagging
it  ....How was I to know that it hit the Vets arm and he stabbed  his  self
with this big sharp pointed thing!

So there I was standing there waiting for my Treatment! When this Stupid@2 VET
@3suddenly falls Asleep@1 (Huh! Buddy Hewmans)
@3
Well to give old Grumble guts his Due, He was as upset as I was and shot out
of the Room to complain to the Woman outside.

Then the Two of them came back in and tried to waken up this Vet,  But NO he
was  fast asleep.  The Woman then ran out of the room and Grumble Guts looks
at  me and says@5 "YOU BAD DOG"@1 ......@3I mean gives a break here,  I'm standing
terrified on this table...Minding my own Bussiness ....And I'm a@2 BAD DOG?
@3
Sheech!   ....Any way some time later two men came and put the @2 VET@3  into  a
little bed thing and then threw him in the back of this big VAN.

Me  and old Grumble Guts ....We just got in the car and went home.  Huh!  so
much for your National Health Service ...  There was Me not to well and What
treatment do I get .....None!

Ach!  Well at least I felt a bit better the next day ....Must have been  all
that  fresh  air I got in the Car ....But for some reason old  Grumble  guts
wouldn't talk to me for days ....No treats nothing!
@4
              Yeah! Your a weird bunch to understand sometimes!
