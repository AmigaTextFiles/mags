                             An ESD Basic Primer

"ESD"  stands for ElectroStatic Discharge.  You've encountered electrostatic
energy in your everyday life and may not have known it.  For example,   when
you  get  shocked by a doorknob after walking across a carpet on a dry  day,
you  have  experienced an ESD event.  When your clothes cling to each  other
when  you remove them from the dryer,  often called 'static cling',   it  is
caused  by  an electrostatic charge.  And in it's most dramatic  form,   the
lightning in a thunderstorm is a massive electrostatic discharge.

                            So ESD is a bad thing?

No,  not at all.  Electrostatic charges are used for many productive things.
Electrostatic charges are used to apply toner to paper in most  modern  copy
machines  and  computer laser printers.  It is also used in residential  and
commercial  air cleaners to make dust stick to the filter.  Like  any  other
form  of  energy,  when it is controlled it can be used in productive  ways,
but when it is uncontrolled, damage or destruction may result.

                            What harm can ESD do?

Around  your house,  not much.  It is possible that if you get a shock  when
touching your home computer,  stereo,  or other electronic device that  some
damage  may occur,  but the chances of this are remote.  Most likely,   your
computer  will  reset  or your stereo will forget all  the  stations  you've
programmed into it.  Most companies design protection against ESD into their
products.

Of course,  if you have taken apart your computer or stereo, and have an ESD
event  when  touching the internal components,  you have  a  great  risk  of
damaging  or  destroying the electronic circuitry.  The protection  designed
into these products is no longer effective when you are in contact with  the
internal  parts  and  components because the individual  components  usually
have little or no ESD protection built into them.
With  this in mind,  consider the factory where your computer or stereo  was
manufactured.   The  people and machines that work  there  are  in  constant
contact with the internal workings and components of these products.  ESD in
such  factories can be staggeringly expensive.  Electrostatic discharges  in
manufacturing  facilities can cause all kinds of defects and  problems  with
the  products  assembled there.  It can also damage sensitive equipment  and
machines  used  in  the manufacturing process.  ESD is  a  huge  concern  in
factories that produce everything from computers and stereos,  to electronic
components. Even wheat flour and fertilizer.

                        Wheat flour and fertilizer???

Yes,  for two reasons.  One of the properties of an electrostatic charge  is
its  ability to attract dust and make it stick to things.  In factories that
produce  flour,  fertilizer,  and other powered products there is usually  a
fair  amount of dust flying around.  An electrostatic charge on fixtures  or
surfaces can easily cause them to be quickly coated with whatever powder  or
dust is in the area.

The  second  reason is that the spark caused by an ESD event  is  incredibly
hot,   even  though  you  can barely feel it when you  touch  that  infamous
doorknob.  It is,  after all, just a very tiny lightning bolt. Many powders,
such as wheat flour,  for example,  are amazingly explosive when floating in
the air as dust.

Imagine a flour mill that is turning raw wheat into the flour used  to  make
bread.   The  machinery  is running and there is fine  wheat  dust  floating
through  the air.  A mill worker walks across the production floor  and  his
polyester overalls generate an electrostatic charge.  When he arrives at the
machine,  he reaches out to touch a control panel and there is an ESD event,
a  tiny  spark  jumps from his finger-tip to the control panel.   This  tiny
spark ignites the dust in the air at his finger-tip,  then this fire quickly
travels  through  the  dust  suspended in the factory  air,   and  within  a
fraction  of  a second a huge explosion leaves the factory on  fire  and  in
ruins. Disasters of this type are uncommon, but legendary.

In this sort of environment,  ESD controls do two things:  First,  they work
to  minimize  the  amount  of dust suspended in the  air  and  collected  on
surfaces,  thus reducing the chance of an explosion.  Second,  they work  to
reduce  or  eliminate   the   possibility   of   the  worker  generating  an
electrostatic charge while going about his business. No spark, no boom.

ESD  is  an  issue  in  many  other industries as well.   Printing  presses,
factories  that  produce  plastic wrap and other  film  products,   hospital
operating  rooms,  to name only a few,  all have to deal with  ESD  and  its
potential to damage products, equipment, and possibly harm people.

                        So, where does ESD come from?

A  complex  physics  lesson  may be in order to  explain  how  electrostatic
charges are generated,  but for the purpose of this discussion,  we'll use a
very simplified explanation.

The  majority of electrostatic charges are caused by two different materials
being  rubbed  together.  When this happens,  one of the materials  tend  to
become  positively  charged,   and the  other  tends  to  become  negatively
charged.  You may think of these charges like the energy at the positive and
negative  connections  of your car battery;  as long  as  nothing  lets  the
positive energy reach the negative energy,  everything stays where it is, or
"static."

When  you  walk  across the carpet,  your shoes rub against  the  floor  and
generate a static charge which is stored in your body.  The clothes tumbling
around in your dryer rub against the drum and the other clothes,  generating
an  electrostatic charge which is stored in the clothing itself.   And  when
huge  masses of air at different temperatures or pressures collide  and  rub
against each other, massive charges are generated and stored in the clouds.

Of  course,   different  materials generate  different  amounts  of  charge.
Without  a doubt,  the largest charges are generated when plastic is  rubbed
against  some  other  material.   Most   clothing,   carpeting,   furniture,
appliances,  and machines contain various types of plastic.  Other materials
that  generate relatively large charges are hair,  fur,  rubber,   and  air.
Charges can even be created from paper, cardboard, and water.

          How does this Electrostatic charge actually damage things?

Though  it's  been explained how an electrostatic charge can cause  a  fire,
ESD- triggered fires and explosions are rare.  Most often the damage  is  in
the form of destroyed or injured electronic components.

Picture a man welding a piece of metal.  There are two cables that come from
the welder;  one is positive and one is negative.  The workman attaches  the
negative  cable  to the metal he wants to weld,  and the positive  cable  is
attached to the welding rod in his handpiece.  As he places the welding  rod
near  the metal he wants to weld,  the electrical charge leaps from the  rod
to  the metal and creates an arc.  This arc is hot enough to melt the metal,
and the weld is made.

Now  imagine the inside of an electronic component,  an integrated  circuit,
for  example.  There are all kinds of metal wires which allow the  component
to function.  All the internal conductors of the component are near the same
level of charge,  so there can be no discharge or damage.  However,  when  a
human  with  a  charge touches his finger to a lead of the  component,   the
charge travels from his body into one of the wires leading to the inside  of
the  component.   When  it  gets near metal  of  a  different  charge,   the
electrostatic energy creates an arc, leaping from one component to the next.
Now granted,  this arc inside the integrated circuit is very small,  but the
metal parts in there are equally small.  The arc in the component acts  much
as  the one with the welder,  melting or vaporizing some of the metal in the
part.   This can cause the metal parts in the component to 'short' together,
or  to be blown away completely.  When an ESD-damaged component is dissected
and the area of the ESD event photographed with an electron microscope,  the
damage to the inside of the component looks exactly like the effect  of  the
welder on the metal that has been welded.

However,  not all ESD damage is this obvious.  When an electronic  component
has  been destroyed by an ESD event,  it is fairly simple ( though expensive
)  to isolate the bad part and replace it. A far greater problem occurs when
a  component has been damaged,  but still functions.  While the  machine  or
product is still at the factory,  it works perfectly. But, the ESD damage to
the  components  inside may cause a failure days,  weeks,   or  even  months
later.   Many  times a factory may not be aware that it has an  ESD  problem
until  they notice a high level of their products being returned  when  they
originally worked fine.

                          So how is ESD controlled?

That depends on where the problem is.  For your shocking doorknob, there are
materials  that can be applied to the carpet that will stop  the  generation
of  a  charge.  In a clothes dryer,  you can add fabric softener sheets that
will  apply a small amount of a chemical to your clothes to make them resist
the build-up of a charge.

Solving  the  ESD problem in a factory,  however,  is much more complicated.
Factories  are  equipped with conductive floors that  will  not  generate  a
charge.   Employees wear special coats,  and/or grounding  straps  on  their
shoes.  When they are at a work bench,  employees wear a grounding cord from
their  wrist to ground their bodies.  Various types of ionizers are used  to
produce a gentle flow of ionized air to neutralize electrostatic charges  on
all  kinds of materials.  Millions of dollars are spent each year to  battle
ESD in manufacturing and other professional environments,  but the potential
for loss due to ESD caused damage is in the billions.

                           Where can I learn more?

To  learn  more  about how to avoid,  control,  and deal with  ESD  in  your
environment,   the best source of information is the ESD Association.   This
national  nonprofit group,  comprised of professionals and experts  in  this
field,   was  chartered to educate those with concerns regarding  ESD.   The
Association  has  a  wide  variety of documentation  available,   and  holds
periodic educational meetings and symposia across the country.

The  EOS/ESD Association also maintains a web-site on the internet that  can
provide some information,  and points of contact within the association. The
web site can be found at www.eosesd.org.

There are local chapters of the association which can provide you access  to
experts  in  ESD  who live and work in your own area.  Most  local  chapters
conduct  regular educational meetings,  and can allow you  to  network  with
people  who have concerns just like yours.  The local chapters can  also  be
found on the web site given above.

Another  valuable  source  of information is the companies  who  manufacture
equipment and materials to eliminate and control ESD.  Though they  will  be
obviously  somewhat  biased toward their own products,   they  can  be  good
source  of  expertise  for  solving specific ESD issues  in  your  facility.
Talking to several vendors and as many experts as you can before making  any
purchase decisions is always wise.

So  this is ESD,  in a nutshell.  If you have further questions or concerns,
