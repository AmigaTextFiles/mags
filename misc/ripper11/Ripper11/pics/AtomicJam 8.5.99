The  winged  serpent  floats silently between two pillars of energy drawing
it's  power  from  the  two flaming entities below it.  It prepares for the
biggest  test  of  it's  life,  the  venture into the land of the pulsating
spike.

Don't  worry, I'm not tripping.  I am giving my interpretation of the decor
in  the  main  arena  courtesy  of  Scientists  In Space, Tranceart and The
Curious  Company.   They  have certainly tried hard for this one.  Not only
have they got all the famous, flashing spiky balls hanging from the ceiling
but  they have transformed the stage into some sort of gateway with hanging
beings and luminescant drapes.

What  a  line up they pulled together tonight!  And what a brilliant mix of
music,  spread  over  3  rooms.   The  main arena was obviously playing the
hardest of hardest, underground techno while the back bar supplied the drum
and bass and the small chapel acted as a chill out room with all aspects of
house music.

Chris  Liberator,  Tony Work and Nathan Gregory taunted and played with the
crowd before ripping them apart with industrial strength techno which shook
the  floor  which  we stood on.  Then it was the turn of Richard Bartz from
Germany  with  his  live PA.  He was right at the front of the stage with a
mountain  of  electronic  gear  all  flashing  away  at  his  command.  His
continuous  set  was  mixed  with a perfect learning curve which hypnotised
everyone  in the place.  He teased the crowd, slowly building and filtering
the  sounds  until  the  tension was unbearable.  Then when you thought the
floor  was  made  out  of putty and your toes had gone numb he exploded the
room  with  the  final  beat  at  which  the crowd responded with a roar of
ecstacy.  The vibe was electric.  

When  I  could  sweat no more we descided to check the D&B room which had a
sizable  crowd.  No wonder...  it was Ed Rush on the decks with his MC.  He
dropped  classic  after  classic with beat perfect mixing until it was time
for  Ratty,  Niel Trix, Fallout and Tango to have their say in the Drum and
Bass spectrum.

After a few gallons of water down the neck we preceeded up onto the balcony
to  see  none other than SVEN VATH moving evrything in the whole arena, you
could even see the air moving.  This was his first time in the Midlands for
3  years  and you could tell that he was enjoying it as he leaped about the
place and communicated with the people who had the guts to get up and dance
on  the  stage.  I didn't hear him play any of his own classics which was a
bit  dissapointing  but  even  some  of his own tracks are too soft for the
Atomic Jam crew!  Original Technoheads!

At around 4 AM my whole body was electrified as the floor shook and the air
pulsated with the hypnotising atmosphere.  But as we hadn't checked out the
3rd  room  featuring  Simon  DK,  Rob  Lynch and Jem Atkins among others we
thought  we  should  pay our dues.  And it payed off as one of my favourite
house tunes bounced it's way down the corridors and through the walls, that
is  "Be  yourself"  by Twisted, buy this song NOW!  Your body and mind will
love you for it.

At  around  5  AM  the legendary Sven Vath was still banging away the tunes
with  an  even  bigger crowd up on the stage.  But unfortunatly my body had
failed  me  and I gave in to the techno.  Of course with a huge smile on my
face  because  I  would  remember  this night for a very long time.  For me
Richard Bartz and Sven Vath stole the whole night.  Well done guys!



Upon  exit  I  picked  up about 400 flyers and noticed that one was for the
next Atomic Jam.  WHAT?  New venue? That's right ladies and gents, it seems
that the Atomic Jam team have made up their mind about the Que Club and are
moving to Subway City, also in the City Centre.  I'll keep you posted.
