The  long  awaited return of Music First is back, coupled together with the
legendary Planet V records.




Well  this was some night!  Better and worse than the launch party of Music
First  for  reasons  that I will go into.  I met up with my friends outside
Argos  in the City Centre at 9PM, it was to be a long night.  The place was
supposed  to  open  at  9PM  and  go on till 6AM, unfortunately for reasons
unknown  it didn't open till 9:45PM which pissed some people off but it was
a  warm  night  and  it just gave us all more time to smile and wave at the
Club/Vision  cameras  and  be amused by the business man like antics of the
ticket  dealers  scampering around the road.  The security was tighter than
last time and there was more of them.

When  we  did eventually get in the place was surprisingly unchanged and to
be honest I did expect the word@1 "Refurbishment"@3 to mean more than a new bar
and  a  lick  of  paint, especially in a venue as big as this one@1 (capacity
2500)@3.  First stop was the cloakroom so I didn't boil to death on the dance
floor.   The assistants were efficient and friendly and it only cost a quid
so  there  was  no problems there.  As the place was still fairly empty and
the  night  was so young we decided to go into the main arena and sit up on
the balcony to warm up with DJ ASCENDs warm up set.



And  warm us up he did, even though there was probably only 100, 150 in the
arena by then he was dropping some classic Drum and Bass tracks and putting
a lot of effort into it.  At one point he dropped a track which everyone in
the  place  recognised  and while he was in his record box a sound engineer
walked past the decks and spun the playing record back, obviously he wanted
a rewind, it didn't go well with Ascend though.

One thing I noticed was that the laser had been removed, and the projection
screen@1.....@3   f**king hell!  And the famous inflatables!  What are you upto
Que  Club?   I thought they might have moved them to another room but apart
from  dangerously  loud speakers and new deck stands they were as bland and
boring as they ever were.

Next  up  was  DJ SUV who immediately went into a sub bass trip which was a
vast  jump from the lighter side of ASCEND but was to be the flavour of the
night.   The  MCs Moose and GQ then joined in as the place started to fill.
At  12:30  when  Roni Size and DJ Krust arrived on stage you couldn't move,
let  alone  dance.   It's no wonder the stilt walkers, suitcase dancers and
camera  men  went  up on the stage at this point.  Good though the live set
was  I  couldn't  resist  going into the back bar and checking out the BEAT
JUNKIES  first  set in Britain.  They rocked the place with their beats and
breaks  and the bass was so strong it was moving peoples bottles across the
bar, no joke!

Round  the corner I bought a bottle of water after finding out they stopped
serving  alcohol  at 11PM, it's pretty out of order to let people in almost
an  hour late and then stop serving drinks before the place has even filled
up.   The  water cost me £1.50 which was 50p more than last time so I opted
to fill it up in the water fountains when I needed some.  I walked past the
chill  out  room  which had now turned into a Playstation room and past the
cafe  which  hadn't  changed  at all.  When I returned to the main arena, I
found it hard to get in as it was so packed, so much for finding my friends
again.   I  decided  to go up onto the balcony and saw that a fire breather
was on the stage entertaining the crowd who were going mad for JUMPING JACK
FROST.   Since I hadn't been in there yet I went downstairs to see the Kool
105.6FM  room  which  had a nice sizable crowd but check this out!  ASTRO J
decided to put on a dub plate which he had recorded himself and as the bass
kicked in THE F**KING CEILING GAVE WAY!  I'm telling you!  The plaster fell
off  the  ceiling  onto  the  dancefloor as the tune reached its peak.  The
completely annoyed Kool FM crew which praised the place the next day on the
radio  then  had  to move next door to the acid house room and kick PILGRIM
and  his  buddies  out.   Who made that decision is unknown but it probably
caused a few arguments.


I  decided to leave this problem area and went back to the main arena which
was  still  buzzing to the sounds of ED RUSH & OPTICAL, after another quick
dance  I called it a night and left at 4:30AM, I could have stayed till 6AM
but  after  losing my mates and being slightly disappointed by the problems
my body and brain had given in.


It  turned  out  that  the  Music  First  promoters wanted to use their own
security@1 (which ARE better than the clubs security)@3 as they had done on the
previous  two  events, but the place had changed management on the Thursday
before  the party and the person who now owned it didn't have a license for
late  drinking  or lasers so it seems to me that the council want the place
shut  down  until  they  can  sort  themselves  out  and  get  some descent
management  in  there which I hope they do because now the Music First crew
are  refusing  to use the club because the queuing and all the palaver with
the  security  put  them in bad light.  After all is said and done it was a
good  night but the owner of the place does need to sort some things out to
keep the crowds in there@1 (and to keep the ceilings up)@3.@5
