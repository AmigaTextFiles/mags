@4{K-Lee : Get Away

Get  Away  is  the latest offering from the DanceBeat label and it's  pretty
hot.   K-Lee is the stage name for a young female vocalist born  in  Cali  -
Colombia.  She started her career following her parents as part  of  a  band
playing Latin American tunes on their tours throughout South America.

She  is  now based in Italy where she records with her producers J.Bonazzoli
and L.Verzeletti.

On  this  single  her  Italian crew come together with DanceBeat's  remixers
Zlick 'n Zack for what's sure to be a big summer hit.

The  overall  style of the track as you can imagion coming  from  Sweden  is
Bouncy  /  Euro House.  Iv'e been playing it in my car and it really  is  an
uplifting tune you'd expect to hear in the peak of Summer in clubs and  pubs
everywhere.

K-Lee's  vocal  talents are spot on and really add something  to  the  track
rather than being just something to hear and keep you occupied.  You get all
the  usual housey sounds along with some plucking strings and high frequency
basslines.

The  Zlick 'N Zack remix is obviously aimed at the younger end of the market
and is more commercial than the other tracks.  However the K-Lee mix is just
perfect,  her producers have really put some work into this one.  It  starts
off  with  a bouncy bassline,  following into the main stretch of beats  and
vocals and then keeps cutting back and forth from the harder Techno side  to
the stringy house track,  an amazing combination.  The last track on the  CD
is  the Extended mix which is a drawn out laid back affair which while being
easy  to listen to at home or in the car and could well be used as an  intro
or ending to any DJs House set.

Overal  this CD is a great uplifting house tune,  but if your a no  nonsence
TechnoHead then this will Probably not appeal to you.  Who knows, if it does
well  in  Europe then we could well be hearing it on our radios  or  in  our
pubs over here in the UK.
