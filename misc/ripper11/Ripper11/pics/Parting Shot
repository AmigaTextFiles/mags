Well  once  again  we come to the end of another Issue of  our  little  Disk
Magazine. Strange then that I say in this last file.
@1
                       "@3WELCOME TO THE NEW LOOK RIPPER@1"
@5
I  do  this in the faint hope that by now you will have read several of  the
Articles  and noticed the Differences for your self.  The whole Presentation
of the Disk version of the@2 RIPPER@5 has changed@1 (Hopefully for the Better)@5. So
what  has  exactly brought About these change? Well they are  related  to  3
simple facts@1:

(1)@4   After  my enforced absence from the Production of Issue  10,   I  have
"@1Recharged the Batteries@4" and come back Eager,Enthusiastic and full  of  new
ideas.
@1
(2)@4   And possibly nearer the Truth that the Above statement,  Has been  the
Inclusion in the Team of a couple of new Members.


@7
Jonathan  Bryant@1:-XLR8@5 our new "Music Man" ...Jonathan  used  to  write  the
tracks for the now defunct@6 "Crypt"@5 Disk Magazine.  He is a "Wizard" when  it
comes  to Music and Modules,  Something that has been sadly lacking in  Past
Issues. Just check out his 3 Music Mods on this Issue to see what I mean. If
any  readers out there feel they would like to try to produce Music on their
Amiga's I am sure the XLR8 would only be to happy to hear from you,  Or even
submit a Couple of Question to the Pages of the@2 RIPPER.
@2
Ray Hawkins@1:-@5 Many of you out there will recognise Ray@1 (Dungeon Master)   as
@5the Ex Editor of the @6"Crypt"@5. Yes Ray ran his own DMC Magazine (Over 18) and
has  many  years experience using the Program and displaying the pages.   As
soon as I heard that the@6 "Crypt"@5 was closing down, I was one of the first to
try  to  get  Ray  on-board  the Ripper.  It goes without  saying  that  his
experience and knowledge in this Field is a massive boost to us.

I  certainly cannot claim all the Glory for the Presentation of this  issue,
All  through the Production "Previews" of it have been sent to Ray,  and  he
has  worked hand in hand with me to provide you the Reader with what we hope
you will see as a very professional looking Magazine.
@1
(3)@4   Readers  Contributions@1:-@5 Yep!  Lacking in Quantity  but  excelling  in
Quality! I and all of the Team are constantly Amazed at the High Standard of
some of the Articles#8 YOU@5 the Readers produce.  This issue like all the  rest
WE  have  had to Scream and Shout to get your Submission in,  But when  they
came we are "Gobsmacked" at the Quality that is Produced.@3 MORE! MORE! MORE!
@5
Well  just for once!  I refuse to climb on my Soapbox and give the  standard
lecture regarding you Submissions and what will happen if you don't  support
the Magazine @1(You've heard it all before).

@5 No! I just ask that YOU read through the Pages in this Issue and ask your
self  ....Do  I  want to be part of this? Or do I want to  be  part  of  the
Destruction of it?

I  hope  that every one who has received a Copy of this version,  Will  find
something  contained  within the Pages that will be  of  Interest  to  them,
Regardless of What you use your Computer for or the Level of skill you  have
Attained with it.

Perhaps @1 (As all of us do at sometime)@5  You are feeling a little  under  the
weather and the@3 "Light Entertainment Articles"@5 or Jokes will cheer you up.




There is an Amazing variation of articles in the@2 RIPPER@5 and we can only hope
you  Respond to this by Getting in touch and letting us know what you  liked
or  disliked,  Only by doing this can we continue to progress and grow  into
the type of Magazine YOU want to Read.
