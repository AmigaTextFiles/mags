@3{Numark DM1001X - A DJ Mixer
@4}A Rewiew By XLR8


*2@5
Numark won the mixer of the year award in 1997 for their*3 DM110Xi*2,  the  next
year  they  came  up with the*3 DM1001X*2 and*3 DM1002X*2 which are practically  the
same  except the*3 DM1002X*2 has kill switches.  The*3 DM1002X*2 is priced  at  £145
where  as the*3 DM1001X*2 is £115.  The extra price doesn't really justify  kill
switches,  they are just a novelty really,  anyway these mixers have 3  band
rotary kills on each channel anyway.

It  seems  to me that this mixer is aimed at the beginner end of the market
but  it does actually pack some neat features and look cool too.  The first
thing  I  noticed  was  the  arching 3 colour LED display which arcs to the
sides  of  the mixer and produces a hold LED when it reaches the red.  This
is  especially useful for beat matching.  The only thing I don't like about
the  LED  is  the fact that it can't be used for the left and right channel
independently, it just produces the main output.

The  crossfader  is smooth and strong, plus it's replacable but the channel
faders feel very loose and flimsy, sort it out ALPS.

The  transform buttons are placed nicely near the bottom edges of the mixer
but  again  they don't feel very strong and I don't think they could put up
with much of a battering.

I  haven't  tried  the  mic input because I haven't got a mic to fit a 1/4"
jack input but if the headphone quality and volume is anything to go by, it
should  be  good quality, it has a bass and treble control built in to give
you  that  extra bit of control over your MC.  It also features a talk-over
switch which knocks the sound from the decks down by 14db, which is nice.
  
This  mixer  has a feature which I haven't seen used before  on  any  other,
it's  a  small  3  way  switch  just  above  the  X-Fader.   Placed  central
disactivates the X-Fader and just lets all sound through,  placed  left  has
channel 1 on the left of the X and channel 2 on the right and if the  switch
is  placed right the opposite occurs,  I suppose it's similar to  a  hamster
switch.  It's a good idea but the transform buttons do just as  good  a  job
without  having to fiddle with a much too small switch.  It  really  is  too
small for the casing and is really awkward to move in a hurry,  this  is  my
only  real  moan about this mixer.  The cue mix on the headphones  is  quite
strange  to  get used to as I'm used to the simplified one on the  Blue  but
you do have great control over the output to the headphones,  which,  by the
way are extremely loud.

The  rotary kills are fine and completely knock the sound out  at  the  top,
mid  and bottoms of your song.  Strangely enough the gain controls don't  go
down  far enough and I find myself either turning the fader down or lowering
the  master output which is a bit of a pain but it does show you  how  clear
and  loud  this mixer can be.  I didn't realise how tall this mixer actually
is,   it's  taller  than  my Soundlab turntables  but  luckily  sits  nicely
inbetween them as it's 10" rack mountable.  For this price you really  can't
complain about small things like that though because the amount of  features
it  has sure make up for them.  I've seen entry level mixers which are  much
more  expensive  and have none of the features that this  has.   Anyone  who
wants  a  few  more refineries and extras should buy the*3 DM-2002X*2  which  is
priced  at £195 but for practising at home and doing the odd gig  the  1001X
is  a  perfect  buy.  I bought it mail order from Saphires Sound  And  Light
which  provided free next-day delivery and gave me a free record  bag  which
is excellent service.
