                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@5
First  of  all,  if you are an experienced Amiga user!  Then Sorry  but  these
pages  are not for you!  Many readers of both the Disk & Web versions  of  the
Ripper  are reasonably New to computing,  Or just starting out,  to enjoy  the
more  serious side of the Machine apart from just playing games.   To  try  to
help  these  people @3 "Make the Most of their Amiga"@5 the following  Simple  and
Basic Tutorials have been added to the@2 RIPPER.
@4
                                  Tutorial 1@1
                                  ----------@6
                        Don't be afraid of the@3 "Shell"@1
                        ..............................
@5
You might be surprised at how many people@3 "Cringe"@5 when asked by a Program  or
what  ever to open a shell screen and type in a few lines of text!   It's  the
one  area that the New User seems to fear and ultimately@3 "Shun"@5 However  using
@1"Shell  commands"@5 Releases the@3 "Power"@5 of the Amiga operating System into  the
hands of the user.


@4
                               What is@3 "Shell"@1
                               ...............
@5
Well we are all familiar with the@1 "WORKBENCH"@5 ...  However WORKBENCH is simply
a collection of Drawers and Icons that make using a Shell Command easier!  its
a  GUI ...Graphic User Interface.  So if you perform a task in WORKBENCH@1 ( Say
create a new Drawer )@5 then you are really using a Shell command@1 (MAKDIR).
@5
So you ask! @3 " If I can do something through the GUI@1 (Workbench)@3  Why should I
use a Shell command?"
@5
Well two reasons@1 :@5  First using the@3 SHELL@5 gives you a lot options and secondly
using@3 SHELL@5 can be a lot quicker.

Lets  try  just a small example!  For this We will use Disk 3  of  the  Ripper
Issue  11  .....@1(If you don't have the disk issue ...You don't know what  your
missing ..Then just use any disk you have that has some text files on it)
@5
                          OK! Put Disk3 into the@1 DF0
@5
         Now lets use the Workbench to see what file are in the disk@1:

(1)@4 Double click on the disk icon to open it, What do you see? Nothing!
@1
(2)@4 Right click on the Workbench Menu bar@3 "Windows"@4 and select@3 "Show all
    Files"@4 Now you will see a drawer called@3 "PICS"@4 open it!
@1
(3)@4 Its empty! ..So click on@3 "Show all Files"@4 again ..Success ..You can now
    see all the files on the disk@1 (All the little icons)
@5
                           OK! Lets try the Shell.
@1
(1)@5 Right click on the Workbench Menu bar@1 "Workbench/Execute command"

(2)@5 Ok! You have a little box opened waiting for a command...So type in@1:

                                 dir df0:PICS
@5
            Now you should see a list of all the files on the disk

    Simple Huh! And much quicker that all that clicking in the Workbench!

OK!   lets try something else!  ...Open Workbench/Execute Command again.   The
original  command you entered is still there@1 <dir df0:PICS> @5 ...Delete  the  S
from the end of@2 PICS@5 then press ok. You should get@1:
@3
                    could not get information for df0@1:@3PIC
                               object not found
                           dir failed returncode 20
@5
All this means is that the Amiga could not find a Directory in df0 called @1 PIC
@5...But lets pretend to be really stupid.

                  In the Workbench/execute command box type@1:
#8
                                     why
@5
      Click on ok and the Amiga will attempt to tell you what happened@1:

                 "the last command did not set a return code"
@5
Ok!   lets  say we want a little more Information regarding the files  on  the
disk. Again open Workbench/execute command and type in
@1
                                list df0:pics
@5
Ok! the difference between the dir command and the list command is obvious!

Using  the  list command the shell displays all the files on the  disk @1(Plus)@5
some very useful information

File  size/Date of file etc.  It also shows you on this example that the files
on disk 3 have been archived by Crunchmania @1(crm)@5.

OK!  lets take it just a little further, Select your self a file from the disk
@3(  For this I will select the file "Money")@5  Now lets say you want to save  or
transfer this file to another location@3 ( RAM or DF1)
@5
Open the command box and type@1:

                           copy df0:pics/money ram:
@5
Whoo!   Hoo!  the file is now copied into your Ram Drawer,  Of course  if  you
wanted to copy it to DF1 you would write@1:

                           copy df0:pics/money df1:
@5
Yes you can do this using the workbench/opus etc.  but the speed at which  you
can do it using@3 SHELL@5 is a benifit to you.

Ok!   we  have copied files from one place to another,  Lets try  something  a
little  different.  Open up a text editor@1 (or Wordworth saving as ascii  text)
@5and  write  a  short  file @2 <ian fyvie playing with  SHELL>@5  now  save  it  to
somewhere @1(Say the RAM disk)@5 call it@1 "test"
@5
Now open your Workbench/execute command box and type@1:

                              copy ram:test PRT:
@5
Very  quickly the@3 SHELL@5 sends the text file to your printer and you print  out
the file!

No  need for all that moving the mouse and clicking everywhere to open a  Text
Editor/Word  processor ...finding the file....loading the  file  ....selecting
Print.




Another  very  handy @1 "shell command"@5 is INFO ....Try  typing  this  into  the
Workbench  execute command box!  ....Yup!  it displays a list of  all  current
drives  and a host of Information about them ...Including the amout  of  space
still available on either your Hard drive of Floppy disk.

Of  course using the Shell on your Amiga is a lot more involved than  what  we
have  talked  about here!  But for the moment I am only trying to  tempt  none
shell users to experiment with it.  Its quick and easy@1 (once you learn  a  few
basic commands)@7
