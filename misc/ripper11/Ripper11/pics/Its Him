                         Hi! So this is Ian Urie....

               the legendary (in his dreams) writer for Ripper!

Ian  started  writing  for  Ripper   after   bombarding  Baz  with  pleading
letters.Despite  being  a  semi  bald ,fat little  individual,he  persevered
writing  his  sad little letters ,hopeful that someone would let  him  write
for them.

Baz  being the warm,soft hearted individual that he is,took pity on Ian  and
gave him a job in the flagship magazine.

After  a  while,Ferret helped by taking him under his wing and learning  him
all about Amigas and their wondrous qualities.

Then  Dirk  had a go at turning Ian into a provider of decent copy  for  the
magazine.Sadly,Ian hasn't progressed very far yet.

Ian  has  continued writing for Ripper even after all the others laughed  at
his efforts and he is determined to prove them all wrong!

So,as  Ian  proves,you don't need real talent to succeed  ,rather  you  need
friends to help you :)
