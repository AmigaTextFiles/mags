I'm well chuffed!  It's the first bank holiday weekend in ages where the sun
has  been  out in full force.  I've been working on my car (Read  MFC)   and
getting  a lot done so I think I deserve the reward of going out and  having
another wicked night out in Brum.... but wait!




This isn't an all-nighter,  it's a bank holiday Sunday all-dayer.  All-dayer
doesn't  sound as good a phrase but this is to be my first one so I'm  going
to give it all I got.

Mixmad phoned me up earlier in the week with a few sketchy details about the
event and who was to be playing.  I'd never been to Edwards before as it  is
almost  always used as a@1 "rockers"@3 bar but unbenown to me it  was  available
for  hire  which is obviously what Birmingham new-comers@1 "UNIT B"@3 have  done
with  it.   We got tickets in advance for £10 each which is a bit  dodgy  if
it's  a new venue and new event@1 (it could be a flop)@3,  but with people  like
Julian  Liberator and Tony Works in the Techno room and Ascend and Ultravibe
in  the  D&B  room it was a risk worth taking.  There's nothing  worse  than
arriving at a club only for the tickets to be sold out.

The event actually started at 2pm on the Sunday but since we had been out on
the  piss/pull in Redditch the night before and the Grand Prix on the TV  we
didn't  get to the venue till 5pm.  After a thourough search by Edwards  own
security team we arrived at the small reception area.@5

            "That'll be £10 please@1.......@5 Oh you've got tickets."

I  asked where I could park my coat but the young assistant said she  didn't
know  anything about cloakroom details.  There was a cloakroom in the  place
but it was unmanned.

The first room we arrived in was surprisingly big with a low ceiling but was
surprisingly empty also.  It was the drum and Bass room with Unison  on  the
decks being surrounded by a load of standers and gazers.  The sound in  this
room  was of top quality,  combining power with overall clarity.  With small
venues  like this volume is not important as the sound travels  but  if  you
can  get  the  quality  sorted  out   your  in  for  a  winner.   The  first
dissapointment was that there was no drinks on tap so we had to  settle  for
bottles.  Bottles of Carlsberg were only £1.50 all night which made  up  for
no tap.  The decor in this room was good, the ceiling was all one big wobbly
mirror  and  there was the usual UV,  lighting and flourescants hanging  off
the walls.  To the back of the room were two or three pool tables which  was
a nice addition, the rockers bar most essential item i suppose.

Upstairs was about the same size with a long bar and a dancefloor.  When  we
arrived  in  this room at about 6pm they were playing nice euro  trance  and
throuought the night they proggressed from that to euro house,  hard  house,
euro  techno  and finally Atomic Jam style Underground "FUK  U"  Techno.   I
liked  the  proggression through the styles,  maybe AJ could learn something
from  them  as  walking straight into hard underground  stuff  can  be  like
jumping  into a lake of frozen water.  I recognised a few of the songs  from
the  last AJ event i went to and even recognised some of the punters  I  had
bumped  into there aswell.  Which was surprising seeing as though the  night
was  a bit of a failure.......  This was a fairly big venue and it must have
had  150 people in it max.  It's a real shame to see it like this,  not only
because  the  promoters will make a loss in all ways but  also  because  the
atmosphere doesn't build up to anywhere near as it should be.  Don't get  me
wrong it was a good night,  but now i realise how much a busy venue can make
the atmosphere, or kill it in this instance.

A  song  came  on  which  sounded like the sound  speakers  make  when  your
receiving  a  call  on  your mobile phone...  Thinking  about  it,   someone
probably was receiving a call!

All  night  we  kept  switching back and forth between  rooms  admiring  the
paintings  on the wall but nothing new ever seemed to happen.  The  addition
of  MC Skibadee in the D&B room was a great boost and he managed to get some
people up and moving but by 10:30pm the boredom had set in and we called  it
a  night.   All  I  can say to the promoters is that it could  have  been  a
brilliant night but obviously the advertising had been used properly,   even
the  guy  who  sold us the tickets in Swordfish hadn't heard anything  about
it. Better luck next time guys.

Outside,   back  in  the city centre it was quite busy with  punters  moving
between  venues.  First off after a trip to a chippy where the chips  tasted
crap and James dropped his sausage down a drain I bumped into an old school
pal  at  the bus stop.  After chatting his girl crew up we moved on  to  the
"track"  or the "S's" but nothing was going on there so we made our  way  to
the  bus  stops.  Upon arrival we bumped into two guys who  started chatting
to  us.  One was from Kuwait and the other Saudi Arabia!  They were over  in
Brum  stufying for degrees and then were going to go back home.  It's weird,
the  people  you  can bump into when you go out sometimes.   Especially  the
conversations you can have when your clattered!!!!@5
