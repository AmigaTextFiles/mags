                         PAYBACK STATUS REPORT: PART X
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23 April 2000 - The Latest News

There's been a lot of progress this month, although most of it has involved
designing new missions. Anyway, here's what I've been up to since last time:

   - Different types of terrain now offer varying levels of grip.
   - People now have shadows.
   - Motion blurring is now supported.
   - Memory allocation has been made more efficient, reducing the game's
     footprint by 4 Mb, allowing the game to run confortably on a 16 Mb Amiga.
     As a side effect of this, the game also loads slightly quicker.
   - Explanatory text now appears on screen when you pick up bonuses, gain score
     or lose health.
   - The gameplay has been extensively tweaked and lots of bugs have been fixed.
   - More missions have been written and more of the city has been designed. In
     fact, this forms the bulk of the work done this month.
   - Due to popular demand, it's now possible to handbrake turn your vehicle -
     which is especially fun if you happen to be driving a bus!
   - Decorative objects, such as cones and barriers, have been added.

Well, that's all for this updated. See you next time!

@node not05 "AROS IS NOT DEAD"
                                AROS IS NOT DEAD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla <digulla@sowatec.com>

Someone posted a message to the AROS-User list mentioning that AROS is dead and
that Amiga doesn't do anything, etc (the usual "I'm unhappy and I want everyone
else to be unhappy, too").

Facts:

   - AROS is not dead. We are currently working on forming a professional, payed
     development team which will work at least part time on AROS. This should
     allow us to finish the work much more quickly. I cannot promise that this
     will really happen but that will be decided on Thursday, the 11th of May
     (next week). I will post here ASA I know something new.

   - I'm in close contact with Amiga and we're bouncing ideas forth and back how
     Amiga and AROS could work together or how AROS could get into a stable
     legal state. Most of these ideas did turn out to be unusable and therefore
     we're not discussing them in the public. Otherwise, there would be a lot of
     havoc and disruption.

   - I'm also in close contact with OAF. AROS and OAF have separated again
     because our mutual goals were no longer compatible. Basically, OAF wants a
     version of AROS under GPL which would allow them to work with FSF and other
     open source organizations which require this. His problem ATM is to find
     out which parts of AROS infringe copyrights, trademarks and patents and to
     find out how he can work around these.

AROS itself will try to move closer to Amiga because then we can get support
from them, we can help Amiga companies to make their old apps work on AROS, we
will get legal protection from Amiga, etc.

I cannot say if either attempt has an advantage over the other. All I can say is
that both make sense and since it's not clear which is better, both should be
tried. May the better win :-)

                  COMMERCIAL AROS, JOBS ARE STILL OPEN, STATUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla <digulla@sowatec.com>

First of all, there are no news regarding the commercial venture which I spoke
about last time. Several ideas are currently weighted against each other and, as
usual when money comes into play, things progress very slowly. In the mean time,
AROS itself progresses at its usual slow pace :-)

As for job appliances, we need five people and only three persons which we can
use, applied, yet. So there are still two, high payed jobs open.

Currently, we use DOpus 4, kindly made available to the Amiga community by GP
Software, to find and fix bugs in AROS.

                             ANNOUNCE: CHARON V1.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Andrija Antonijevic

Charon is easy to use download manager packed with features. The most important
features are:

   - Multiple download of HTTP/HTTPS/FTP files all with/without proxy, with
     resume (if server supports it). HTTPS support using AmiSSL or MiamiSSL.
   - Automatic retry/resume of downloads up to specified number of tries.
   - Huge number of options to customise it as you wish including: setting
     timeout after which download is retried, setting minimum allowed number of
     CPS, maximum number of CPS...
   - Scheduled downloads.
   - Integrated Internet searches such as Aminet search, MP3 search, Lycos
     FTPSearch etc.
   - Has a HTML parser window which shows all links in a file.
   - It can automatically choose proxy based on your hostname or IP address.
   - ARexx interface.
   - MUI GUI.
   - And many other things I can't remember at the moment...

For more information please go to http://www.bigfoot.com/~TheAntony/Charon/

Version 1.2 is a small update. Here is list of changes since v1.1:

   - It is now possible to hide only main window and leave other windows open,
     f. ex. active downloads window.
   - New option to make close window gadget act as iconify command.
   - Finally properly fixed time remaining indicator.
   - Somewhat undocumented tooltype/argument DEBUG has been changed to LOG which
     now optionally logs almost everything that happens while URL is downloaded.
   - Fixed two bugs in HTML parsing, one of the two could be quite fatal at
     times (luckily, it would rarely happen).
   - New ARexx command BACKUP which forces immediate backup of the list file.
   - QUERY ARexx command now has two new arguments: TRANSFEREDLENGTH and
     FULLLENGTH.

@node not08 "PERSONAL PAINT AND OTHER CLOANTO PROGRAMS NOW IN AMINET"
            PERSONAL PAINT AND OTHER CLOANTO PROGRAMS NOW IN AMINET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cloanto have made three of their Amiga commercial programs freely available from
Aminet for private, non-commercial and non-profit uses. They are:

   - Personal Paint 7.1b

     Personal Paint 7.1 is a powerful and intuitive paint, image processing,
     animation and 24-bit printing package. Employ stunning effects like
     emboss, water-colors, transparencies and stereograms (as in "Magic Eye"),
     while virtual memory and blitter emulation free precious Chip RAM by using
     other storage resources! Plus: support of RTG graphics cards, different
     file formats (IFF, GIF, PNG, PCX, JPEG, BMP, TIM, Photo CD, C source code,
     DataTypes, etc.), nine brushes, two independent working environments,
     multi-level Undo/Redo, animation storyboard, Bézier curves, autoscroll
     painting, Internet publishing features (GIF animations, map editor,
     professional color reduction, transparency and progressive display),
     superior text editor, color fonts, PostScript output, screen and window
     grabber, 181 ARexx commands...

     The Aminet version contains a complimentary edition of the full and latest
     commercial version of Personal Paint 7.1b. The main differences between
     the Aminet distribution and the commercial product are some tutorials and
     artwork add-ons, which for space reasons would not be practical to include
     in the archive, and the GIF I/O library, which cannot be redistributed due
     to licensing restrictions. Documentation is included in English, German
     and Italian.

   - ColorType 3.1

     ColorType has been acclaimed as the best bitmapped fonts editor for the
     Amiga by enthusiasts and professionals worldwide. It is the leading tool
     for handling fonts in up to 256 colors (no size limit, RTG compatible).
     Its Rexx interface enables integration with other packages and makes
     external functions directly accessible from the tool bar. For example, it
     is possible to apply image processing and textures to existing fonts.
     Amiga-supported vector fonts (CompuGraphic, Adobe Type 1, etc.) can be
     used to automatically create ColorFonts in any size. Special functions for
     anti-aliasing (even using a vector font as a point of departure),
     right-to-left fonts, texturing and image processing (in combination with
     Personal Paint) are provided, among others. This makes it an ideal
     companion to video applications, and a must for titling.

     The Aminet archive contains a complimentary edition of the full and latest
     commercial version of ColorType 3.1.

   - Personal Fonts Maker

     Personal Fonts Maker is a powerful tool for designing and processing
     bitmapped fonts. Amiga fonts and fonts created with Personal Fonts Maker
     can be transferred to the printer memory and printed at maximum quality
     and speed. Personal Fonts Maker can output fonts in formats which can be
     read by other Amiga programs, by other computers and by a vast range of
     differing printers (even 48-pin and laser printers). The program can
     import graphics. It is possible, for example, to work on typographical
     fonts input from a scanning device. Complex and/or repetitive
     transformations on characters or entire fonts can be defined, recorded,
     stored and executed as macros. A special programming language can be used
     to define the format in which fonts are to be saved or sent to a printer.
     The Personal Fonts Maker package includes a multitude of original fonts
     and support tools like Printer Driver Modifier, which allows the user to
     personalize printer drivers. The manual is full of examples and
     introductory sections for novice users, and comes complete with technical
     information for Amiga experts.

     The Aminet archive contains a complimentary edition of the full and latest
     commercial version of Personal Fonts Maker and Printer Driver Modifier
     programs.

You can download them from any Aminet mirror, for instance:

   - ftp://se.aminet.net/pub/aminet/biz/cloan/PPaint.lha
   - ftp://se.aminet.net/pub/aminet/biz/cloan/ColorType.lha

                                   CS&E NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CS&E (1.4.2000):

Today (Saturday) we completed formalities with a very promising new team of
developers from Liverpool in England (you know, where the Beatles came from :)
named Electronic Dreams Interactive. We will be working with Electronic Dreams
to produce high quality education and entertainment software in the future in
addition to helping to open an office. Electronic Dreams' intention is to become
the major 'in-house' development team of CS&E and this is a goal we share with
them.

The first title is named as Cosmo's Fun Class which is an education title
featuring 17 interactive activities for the progressive learning of your child.
This includes activities covering numeracy and spatial skills by use of fun
ideas such as cooking, sport, music and even changing people's faces! We have
together enjoyed great praise from several schools in the UK which we visited.

Because of the years of development behind it for such a specialist title we
have made it the flagship of our education course which is part of what you get
if you join the CS&E club (more info at http://www.icatmall.com/cse). In
addition to this Cosmo's Fun Class will be internationally distributed as a must
for serious users of the Amiga. We expect that the price will be around £30
which includes the professional packaging one can expect from a company such as
CS&E. In the United Kingdom over 250 stores (a similar number to our PC titles)
have already agreed to stock the product which is really getting the Amiga
noticed as a machine for education. This is great news and CS& is delighted to
be publishing such a wonderful piece of education software. A demo featuring
several unrestricted activities is under construction. This will be released of
course first to members of our club but then also through other magazines for
everyone to see how good it is.

Much of Cosmo's Fun Class is complete and a release date of 2 months away is not
unrealistic. CS&E have stepped in to suggest final touches to make the product
as polished as possible. News will also be posted at http://www.CSandE.co.uk in
our next update.

                              EPIC MAY AMIGA NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is another issue of our news letter informing you about new products and
services, along with news and other interesting items.

  1. OK first the bad news, it appears there have been some technical problems
     with Simon II which has delayed the launch, but we have been informed that
     they are now doing the final testing so we should have a release date soon.
     If you do have release questions please send them to epic@swol.de.

  2. We all know what a great game Virtual Grand Prix is well Palolo Cattani
     (the guy who wrote it) has added some updates. There is new season
     information and car detail. There is also a 1999 and 2000 season update
     from Nico Barbat. You can find the information and download them at
     http://www.epic-direct.co.uk/amiga/newpage/vgp_download.html. If you have
     not got Virtual Grand Prix
     (http://www.epic-direct.co.uk/amiga/cdgames/vgp.html), then mention
     VGP1_offer and you can buy it for the discounted price of only £15.00

  3. Wordsworth 6 office (http://www.epic-direct.co.uk/amiga/product/cd978.htm)
     We have a limited qty of this great office product that contains all 4 of
     Digita's award winning software applications, Wordsworth 6, DataStore 2,
     Money Matters 4 and Orginiser Limited edition at £35.00, for more details:
     http://www.epic-direct.co.uk/amiga/product/cd978.htm.

  4. Amiga have just launched a new magazine called Amiga World. This new online
     Magazine will be covering issues about the new Amiga and the now called
     Classic Amiga, check it out at http://www.amiga.com.

  5. Although we run a Web based Amiga company it can still be hard to know all
     the sites that are out there covering the Amiga, so I was quite surprised
     when I found Amiganet.com (http://www.amiganet.com). This site is really a
     place where you can post information about yourself and your Amiga setup,
     but you can also see what other people are using, so you could find a
     friend we a similar spec or setup and exchange info. I thought this was a
     great idea for a site and well worth a mention.

  6. You can purchase Ink replacement cartridges through our new mirror site
     called Ink-er-net (http://www.inkernet.co.uk). This site has a fully
     functional javscript shopping cart system to make it easier to purchase,
     it also connected to our 128k secure server. If you are having printer
     driver problems or want the latest driver check out our drivers at
     http://www.epic-direct/inks/amidrive.html.

  7. You may of heard it has been announced that Heretic II has been released,
     we are still having problems importing our copies, we are under the
     impression that the advert announcing the release was actually out earlier
     than expected, we are trying to clarify the situation.

  8. Check out ABUSE. This is sure to become one of those great classic side
     scrolling soot-em-ups. This one boast 15 action packed missions,
     resolutions up to 1024 X 768 and graphic card support. you can check out
     the details: http://www.epic-direct.co.uk/amiga/cdgames/cd1145.html

  9. Epic and Paul Burkey are proud to announce the coming of "Foundation
     Mission CD, The Undiscovered Land". The CD will need "Foundation Directors
     Cut" and will bring 40 new missions to this classic as well as many other
     new features. The CD will cost £15.00 will be availble late May/early
     June. We are now taking pre-orders: Club Card Holders Pre-Order at only

@node not13 "FOUNDATION LATEST NEWS"
                             FOUNDATION LATEST NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paul Burkey, author of the original "Foundation" and "Foundation: The Directors
Cut", has updated his homepage with information about new releases.

May 2000 will see the release of two new Foundation products. These are based on
the original 'Foundation' and 'Directors Cut' games and are not linked to the
'Foundation's Edge' sequel. Both products are based around a new set of Conquest
Missions featuring 40 new levels. It was originally planned as a 'Mission Pack
CD' but grew into something bigger.

There will be two products, one designed as a budget priced add-on pack and the
other as a complete stand-alone package. Both packages will contain
optimizations and new gameplay features. The stand-alone package (titled
Foundation Gold) will feature extra speech and a complete graphics makeover
covering character animation, buildings, textures, land objects and graphical
user interface. Both packages will also feature enhanced versions of the
original 40 Conquest Levels and the addition of a variable difficulty setting
with advanced computer AI.

On the other hand, the Foundation's sequel, Foundation's Edge, is now scheduled
for a November/December 2000 release. The project has grown much larger than
originally expected. Development for multiple platforms has been expanded. This
includes development for Amiga Inc's new Amiga Platform.

More information regarding these new products will be available soon.

@node not16 "HYPERION PRESENTS ITS AMIGA RELEASE SCHEDULE FOR 2000"
             HYPERION PRESENTS ITS AMIGA RELEASE SCHEDULE FOR 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leuven, 17 April 2000

                                  Introduction

In the next few days Hyperion entertainment software will celebrate its first
birthday. When we started this venture, our stated goal was to bring high-end,
high-quality entertainment software to the Amiga.

We feel that we are well on our way to accomplish this. Over the past year, we
built up an impressive code-base that will allow us to dramatically cut down on
the development time of new Amiga conversions. Part of this code-base has
already been made available to the Amiga development community: MiniGL,
chunkyppc.library, an improved version of Warp3D (together with Sam Jordan) etc.

We mastered two of the most impressive 3D engines out there: the Quake II engine
and the LithTech engine. Together with Titan we brought Smacker, an industry
standard video-codec, to the Amiga.

We are now ready to accelerate our development cycle over the course of the next
few months.

At this point we would like to address some frequently asked questions.

   - Why does Hyperion only port old PC games?

   - Whilst it is true that we have licensed some titles from December 1998, we
     do not limit ourselves to older games, as will become apparent in the next
     few weeks. Titles like Shogo, Heretic 2 and SiN were chosen for a reason.
     First of all, it should be remembered that the current Amiga PPC hardware
     is already two-three years old and that it will be hard-pressed to keep up
     with state of the art PC games. Secondly, we prefer to port older, quality
     titles rather than newer games nobody will remember six months down the
     road. Finally, it should be remembered that most of the time there is
     period of many weeks and usually even months between the time a title is
     released on the PC and the time it is actually finished and the last patch
     is made available.

   - Will Hyperion support new Amiga hardware based operating systems not
     developed by the Amiga Corporation?

   - The answer is simple: no. Leaving aside considerations such as further
     market fragmentation which would lead to sharply reduced sales in the
     Amiga market and the fact that we would need to rebuild our code-base, we
     want to make it clear, once and for all, that licenses are tied to a
     specific operating system, not to a specific hardware platform. If it were
     otherwise, we would just get a license for PPC and we could port for any OS
     running on PPC including MacOS, AmigaOS, Linux PPC, Beos etc. In reality
     our license agreements limit the scope of our rights to AmigaOS meaning
     ports for AROS, PowerOS, MorphOS, Neutrino/QNX etc. are LEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE
     and would require prior re-negotiation of our license agreements. We would
     think it highly doubtful that large entertainment software companies would
     even consider this without very substantial upfront royalty payments which
     would be impossible to recuperate due to low sales. Obviously, the new
     Amiga OS based on Elate IS covered by our existing license agreements as
     it is an OS developed and marketed by the Amiga Corporation. We therefore
     can and will support the new Amiga OS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                         Work in progress. An overview.

   - Heretic 2: The Amiga conversion of Heretic 2 was completed some weeks ago
     but is currently stuck in Quality Assurance at Activision due to problems
     with the test-machine we sent them. We have dispatched James Sellman to
     Santa Monica in an attempt to get these problems out of the way. Heretic 2
     was demoed extensively on two machines at the Saint-Louis show and despite
     running continuously for two days, never produced a crash.

   - SiN: Development of SiN is progressing very rapidly thanks to the code and
     knowledge-base we built up for Heretic 2. We anticipate completion in 2-3
     months at most. More information will follow soon.

   - Shogo: Porting Shogo:MAD proved to be quite a challenge. Our contract-work
     for Monolith on the software renderer for LithTech V2 (all platforms) has
     caused further delays but we are now rapidly nearing completion. More
     information will follow.

   - LithTech V1 & V2: The significance of the Shogo port goes far beyond the
     specific game in question. Hyperion is bringing this world-class 3D engine
     to the Amiga platform which will allow for easy porting of upcoming titles
     based on LithTech. The list of licensees for the LithTech engine is
     growing rapidly (see: www.monolithnews.com/lithtech2_licensees.html) and
     each and every one of this titles can be brought to the Amiga in a matter
     of weeks. Moreover, Hyperion has the right to extend its agreement with
     Monolith to cover all LithTech based titles developed and owned by
     Monolith which includes at the time of writing the very promising (and as
     of yet unreleased) titles Sanity and No-one Lives Forever (for further
     information see: www.monolithnews.com). If you want an absolutely stunning
     demonstration of what LithTech V2 can do, go and download Monolith's
     promotional video at http://www.lith.com/lithtech/release/.

   - Worms Armageddon: Development was delayed because of lack of development
     resources. We are still targeting an early beta-version for the end of Q2.

   - Freespace: Development will start soon. Expected completion by early Q3.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 The future...

Hyperion is on the virge of finalising at least three more agreements for top
quality entertainment titles to be released in the year 2000.

Upgrade your machine and stay tuned!

         - Simulation of a DigiCam (only limitation: The simulation does not
           store information on which pictures should be deleted from the cams
           memory)

      - VHI Studio VD (Virtual Disk)
         - all imagedata in memory is available as files
         - MPEG-Encoding does no more require ANY temporary files
            - Save space on your HD
            - faster encoding, as the imagedata is no more loaded from HD but

1. Introduction

MetalWeb is the first WYSIWYG HTML editor for AmigaOS. The philsophy behind the
software is that you should not need to understand HTML in order to create pages
within MetalWEB. You can create web pages via a DTP style editor or the 'old
way' via a tabbed, coloured text based source window. Indeed, like the
award-winning Dreamweaver you can open both the edit and source window, work
within one of the windows, whilst the other window updates, automagically!

2. Note for registered MetalWeb users

MetalWeb 4 requires a keyfile to work. The upgrade for registered MetalWeb (1, 2
and 3) users is 20$.

@node not21 "FIRST PUBLIC RELEASE OF MIAMI DELUXE"
                      FIRST PUBLIC RELEASE OF MIAMI DELUXE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nordic Global Inc. Ukiah, April 12th, 2000


For immediate press release

We are happy to announce the first public release, version 1.0c, of "Miami
Deluxe", our new high-end TCP/IP router stack for Internet and LAN access
(short: "MiamiDx").

MiamiDx is the successor of our successful "Miami" software, the most widely
installed TCP/IP Internet software for AmigaOS, and winner of the "Amiga
Achievement Award International" in 1998 for its functionality and ease of use.

Compared to Miami, MiamiDx provides the following additional features:

   - Support for multiple interfaces, e.g. Ethernet and PPP at the same time.

   - Routing between interfaces.

   - IP/NAT (IP masquerading), allowing fully transparent "modem sharing",
     similar to "WinGate", "SyGate", "WinRoute", "ipchains" etc. on other
     platforms. Eliminates the need to configure proxy servers.

   - Built-in SOCKS daemon, for even better compatibility of "modem sharing".

   - Built-in firewall. Fully auto-configuring, and thus extremely easy to set
     up. Combined with its very secure, state-of-the-art TCP/IP kernel the
     firewall provides Amiga users with extensive protection from Internet
     break-ins on all machines in the LAN.

   - Dial-on-demand. MiamiDx can automatically dial up your Internet connection
     if you try to access a web page from your web browser.

   - Interface control panel. An optional configurable window with status and
     statistics information for each interface, and buttons to go online and
     offline. This window takes up much less space than the full user
     interface.

   - Support for Unix domain sockets (AF_LOCAL/UNIX).

   - PPP improvements: PPP layer data encryption (40 or 128 bits) and data
     compression compatible with Windows-NT. Support for MS-CHAPv2. This makes
     MiamiDx compliant with the highest security standards configurable in
     Windows-NT servers.

   - Client driver for PPPoE, making MiamiDx the only AmigaOS software to
     support the new industry standard for DSL modems, used e.g. by T-DSL
     (DTAG, Germany), Sympatico (Canada) and Earthlink (USA).

   - Client drivers for PPTP and L2TP. This allows MiamiDx to connect to VPNs
     (Virtual Private Networks) using either Unix or Windows standard
     protocols.

   - Set of DNS tools from the BIND V8 distribution, including Addr, DiG,
     DNSQuery, Host and NSLookup.

   - MiamiFtp: Full-featured command line-based FTP client, with very high
     performance (async file I/O), support for CERN-style proxies (http://,
     ftp://), ftp proxying, resuming transfer ("reget") and many other
     features.

   - MiamiTelnet: telnet client, providing by far the most comprehensive set of
     features of any AmigaOS telnet client, including monochrome and color
     mode, VT100 emulation, SSH, SSL, SRP, rlogin, telnet, line mode, 8-bit
     support, XPR support, chat line, TN3270 and much more.

   - MiamiTelnetD: telnet/rlogin daemon for AmigaOS, the only one that emulates
     an AmigaOS console, making it compatible with most pagers and
     console-based editors.

MiamiDx 1.0c is available for download from www.nordicglobal.com. A demo version
(with a time limit and other limitations) is available for free. The full
registration costs US$ 60.00. An upgrade from a registered version of Miami (any
version) costs US$ 30.00.

The easiest way to register or upgrade is directly from your Amiga, after
installing MiamiDx, using our one-step "QuickRegistration" scheme, paying by
credit card. Registrations are also available from our web site and by email.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Holger Kruse <kruse@nordicglobal.com>

MiamiSSL version 2.21 is available for download from www.nordicglobal.com now.
Changes since 2.11:

   - The "infinite garbage bug" which caused MiamiSSLClient to loop after
     displaying common SSLv2 ciphers is fixed.

   - Some expired certificates have been replaced with newer versions.

   - DH/DSA algorithms are now disabled by default, for a big performance gain
     with some secure web sites (e.g. www.hisoft.co.uk). They can still be
     enabled by the user if this should ever prove necessary.

      HYPERION RELEASES MINIGL TECHNOLOGY TO THE AMIGA DEVELOPER COMMUNITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperion is pleased to announce the release of it's MiniGL technology to the
Amiga developer community. Unlike Mesa, MiniGL provides only a subset of the
OpenGL API which allows for substantially faster performance than Mesa. MiniGL
technology (which requires Warp3D for its operation) was succesfully deployed in
Hyperion's Amiga conversion of Heretic II and will also be used in future
projects such as SiN, Shogo: MAD and Freespace.

MiniGL is hereby released with full source-code and can be incorporated into
commercial and non-commercial projects subject to the following restrictions:

   - MiniGL may only be compiled for/ incorporated in code running on AmigaOS.
     All other rights reserved. This applies only to MiniGL, not to your
     application, i.e. It's OK to port the application to another platform
     using OpenGL.

   - The functional source-code of all and any modifications and improvements
     must be made publically available to the Amiga developer community.

                              SIN: PROGRESS REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29-April-2000: Amiga-version progress update by Peter Annuss

As expected, the experiences we gathered with Heretic II gave quite a boost to
the porting of SiN. Since both games are based on the Quake2-engine, there are a
lot of similarities in the source-code and we were able to reuse large parts of
our codebase

1. SERVER

The server controls all game aspects and consists of the generic server code
(responsible for network communication, world physics, visibility calculations
etc.) and the game.dll, which contains the game logic, enemy AI, ... and
represents the actual SiN game.

As the server code does not contain operating system dependencies and only few
SiN specific changes, it compiled nearly out of the box.

The game.dll required some changes for compilation with GCC, but in general it
is very clean and portable. Creating add-ons with this codebase should be quite
simple.

All in all, porting the server took only a few days. There are some minor bugs
left, but with a local client (see below) they will be fixed soon.
Saving/loading isn't working yet but we don't expect it to be critical.

2. CLIENT

Basically everything you hear and see while playing SiN is done by the client.
It is responsible for communication with the server, controls the graphic and
sound rendering and processes user inputs.

   - Graphic rendering

     This comes in two forms: Software and OpenGL rendering.

     The software renderer uses the CPU to draw everything you can see on the
     screen. For the Amiga version, we decided to use Steffen Haeuser's
     chunkyppc.library to manage the different screen modes/graphic cards. The
     porting of the software renderer is nearly finished. There is a screenshot
     showing it running in window mode on the workbench screen.

     OpenGL is a generic API for 3D graphic rendering. Today it is commonly used
     as a cross-platform interface to 3D hardware accelerators. The Amiga GL
     renderer will be based on our (recently released) MiniGL implementation.
     It is a subset of OpenGL and utilizes Warp3D as the Amiga's 3D hardware
     API.

     Thanks to the generic OpenGL API and our finished MiniGL library the
     porting of the SiN GL renderer was only a question of a few days. All
     fullscreen images you can see on this page were taken from the Amiga GL
     renderer.

   - Sound

     The sound system is not ported yet, but most of it looks similar to that of
     the original Quake2 engine, so the porting will be finished soon. SiN uses
     a unique music system, which in turn is based on the above mentioned sound
     system and will therefore not require additional code.

   - Input

     As is the case for our other Amiga ports, the SiN port will support all
     kinds of input devices like keyboard, mouse, joystick and joypads
     (including PSX joypads supported through psxport.device). There are a few
     bugs left in the input code (for example mouse moves lead to constant
     rotations) but they will be ironed out shortly.

   - Animation playback

     The intro and endgame animations are stored as movie files on the CD. We
     will include the necessary decoder into the SiN executable to allow
     efficient playback. All ingame cutscenes use the 3D renderer and work
     correctly already.

   - Network protocol

     Our Amiga port uses the TCP/IP protocol for network communication and is
     compatible with all common TCP/IP stacks. It can be connected to servers
     running on PC's or act as a dedicated server itself. Of course, normal
     single player gaming does not require a TCP/IP stack.

             AMIGA ANNOUNCES PLANS TO EMBRACE SUN'S JAVA TECHNOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amiga Announces Plans to Embrace Sun's JavaTM Technology as the software
platform for forthcoming New Amiga products

Amiga is the home of a large number of the world's leading edge multimedia
developers, artists and users.

Historically, the Amiga platform has targeted providing the most compelling
multimedia content to desktop systems, the new Amiga platform will continue that
tradition on desktops and address connected, multimedia digital appliances such
as webphones, digital TVs, and web pads. Now the world's most creative
multimedia engineers can leverage the JavaTM platform to target a vast array of
new products and solutions.

The underlying technology used in the Amiga system is a Sun Java branded version
of PersonalJava developed by the Tao Group. Tao's software is a media-rich
environment that was designed from the ground up to run on a wide range of low
cost, processor and memory constrained consumer devices that offer a wide range
of multimedia capabilities.

Within Amiga's new target markets, several key standards groups are adopting
Java technology; HAVi, OSGi and DVB are three examples. Amiga is adopting the
popular Java platform for developers creating new generation content and
applications that could also be used on industry standard devices such as in
home networking and digital television. The millions of Java technology
developers will be able to deploy their innovative content on a wide range of
new products that will excite consumers.

"We are excited to see a longtime favorite of the multimedia developer community
turn to Java technology as their programming platform of choice. The deeply
loyal Amiga developer community will be able to leverage the wealth of Java
development tools and support to build new, highly innovative and fun
applications. We are also pleased that Amiga will work with the Tao Group, a
company dedicated to compatible implementations with media rich capabilities,"
said Curtis Sasaki, Director of Product Marketing, Consumer Technologies, Sun
Microsystems, Inc.

"The New Amiga is a breath of fresh air for the industry, and has a talent pool
of developers who continue to lead the way in the creation of dynamic software
products," commented Bill McEwen, President and CEO, Amiga. "Sun and the Java
platform provide us with great tools, a large number of potentially new
developers, and a well supported platform, and experience in emerging markets.
The Tao intentTM implementation is unique in being able to provide the key
system requirements needed to run the Java platform in mobile and consumer
products."

Francis Charig, Chairman of Tao Group says, "Combining the world's most advanced
community of multimedia artists and engineers with the new industry standard
software [Java] is the next natural step forward. It is wholly appropriate that
Sun, Tao and Amiga work closely together and the result shall be a wealth of
Java technology-based media content for the consumer and other markets."

      - v3_32.lha (1196510 Bytes)
      - v3_32.lzx (1068699 Bytes)

   - V³ update to 3.2 from 3.1 (only contains modified files)

      - v3_update_31_32.lzx (343411 Bytes)
      - v3_update_31_32.lha (355680 Bytes)

   - VFlash Shockwave Flash Player

      - vflash_1.2.lha (564608 Bytes)
      - vflash_1.2.lzx (500510 Bytes)

   - Apdf PDF viewer (includes V³ inline PDF plugin)

      - please download the archive suitable for your CPU, *AND* Apdf_common &
        Apdf_fonts. For detailed instructions, please see
        http://elesueur.free.fr/Apdf

FTP:

   - ftp.vapor.com, /pub/amirc/
   - ftp.us.vapor.com, /pub/amirc/
   - ftp.ch.vapor.com, /pub/vapor/amirc/

WWW:

   - http://v3.vapor.com/
   - http://bespin.siliconcircus.co.uk/vapor/
   - http://vapor.meanmachine.ch/

     (for more mirror sites, see http://v3.vapor.com/)

This is a full release. It has undergone thorough testing by both the alpha
testers and by numerous public beta testers, and should be stable as a rock.

The VFlash and Vpdf plugins are not included in this distribution archive, in
order to keep it to a reasonable size. Please visit http://v3.vapor.com/ for
download information.

The VFlash PPC module needs a new version of ppc.library, which is available
from ftp://ftp.meanmachine.ch/pub/amiga/ppclib/

As usual, the existance of this release does not imply that further development
will stop :) In fact, the next version is already in the works.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Newsflash: Changes since V3.1

   - support for HTTP file upload

   - many bugfixes, including the longstanding random crashes or misbehaviors
     induced by the History list

Not-So-Newsflash: Changes since V3.0a

   - Support for <FONT FACE>, with customizable mappings. Extremly useful in
     conjunction with ttf.library
     (http://home.sprynet.com/sprynet/ragriffi/ttflib.htm)

   - Support for individual table and table cell backgrounds

   - Direct support for FBlit (http://www.tpec.u-net.com), totally eliminating
     the need for intermediate chip mem buffering of images and thus heavily
     improving rendering speed on AGA systems

   - Heavily improved and faster SSL module

   - Heavily improved PNG support

   - Fixed printing with TurboPrint

   - Improved plugin API again. A V plugin version of the Apdf PDF file viewer
     is now available

   - Heavily improved VFlash plugin

   - Numerous bugfixes and minor enhancements in all parts of the code, from
     HTML over networking to Javascript

Hello and welcome to the 21th issue of AmiChannel News.

I'm not a graphics artist. My drawing skills are very limited. So, when my
partner in crime told me that he wanted to overhaul the SAUG website I was very
happy. At the end, the website was going to have a sexy new look :)

If you have ever visited the webpage, you would have seen its simple look.
That's why I didn't care of how it looks with Amiga browsers. But now, I known
how bad they work.

First, Voyager 3.2 which has been released this month. It has problems with
nested tables (it gurues) and it is very sloooooooooow displaying them. Because
of this, it takes some time to display the main page of the WEB.

Ibrowse 2.2 is probably the fastest browser at the Amiga. It does not have
problems with tables, but colours. The background colour at the WEB page is
blue-ish, but IBrowse display as a purple-ish. 

And finally, AWeb 3.3SE (which is included in the OS3.5 distribution) has the
same problem with the background colours as IBrowse, and besides it does not
support the <TABLE ALIGN=CENTER> tag. Bufff.

I can't help to say that Netscape 4.7 and Ibrowse 5.0 are better browsers.

Remember to visit the SAUG website, which is located in:

        http://www.saug.org/

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

        noticias@saug.org

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.
