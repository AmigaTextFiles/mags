@{FG Shine}Welcome to @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 5th issue of @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}.

The  same  mistakes, the same consequences. At @{B}WoA@{UB}, @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} almost killed the
@{B}Amiga  Classic@{UB}.  Sure,  their  plans for the future are cool, but they forgot to
support  the  current  line  of  @{B}Amiga@{UB}s taking into account that Next Generation
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  won't  be  ready  until  the  end  of 1999. Probably you already know the
consequences  of  this  decision:  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  market  shrunk to minimal levels,
magazines  and  companies  gone  out  of  business  ,and  software projects were
canceled.

Then,  it seemed they realized their mistakes and they announced the development
of  the  @{B}OS  3.5@{UB}  at  @{B}MAE@{UB} in Ohio last month. Actually, the responsible for this
change was @{I}Fleecy Moss@{UI}.

@{I}Fleecy@{UI}  is  British and he's a project manager and systems architect responsible
for  implementing entreprise level distributed computing systems. He has been an
@{B}Amiga@{UB} user for about 8 years, and started out on a @{B}Commodore Pet@{UB} and @{B}Vic 20@{UB} when
he was about 11. And he still has to finnish @{B}Cannon Fodder@{UB}.

After  the  @{B}Computer'98@{UB},  our "friend" @{I}Jeff@{UI} seems to revert to his old ways. And
now,  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  has been oficially killed by the parent company because @{I}Fleecy@{UI}
has  been  sacked.  Now, it is uncertain if the @{B}Amiga OS 3.5@{UB} will be released or
not.

As  I'm  against  all the conspiracy theories, I think that this only means that
@{B}Amiga  Inc.@{UB}  has  no  interest in the current line of @{B}Amiga@{UB}s. So they don't care
about  us. And I don't care about them. I hope they will succeed in bringing its
revolutionary  operating  system,  but  if  the fail I won't be worried. This is
their problem, not mine.

Unlike many others this magazine will be released each month as usual. At least,
while there is an @{B}Amiga@{UB} turned on in the world.

They have the Intelectual Propierty, but nor the community nor its philosophy.

Remember to visit the @{B}SAUG@{UB} website, which is located in:

         @{B}http://www.saug.com/@{UB}

or you can visit its mirrors located in:

         @{B}http://soporte.databasedm.es/amiga/sau/@{UB}

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

         @{I}angel@saug.org @{UI}

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.

@{B}AMIGASOC@{UB} HIRES A @{I}"SOUL HUNTER"@{UI}
------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

As  part  of  their  commitment to UK @{B}Amiga@{UB} Users and user groups @{B}AmigaSoc UK@{UB} is
pleased  to  announce  their  lost  souls  database  is  now being automatically
monitored by the @{I}"Soul Hunter"@{UI} program.

The  idea  of  the lost souls database is simple. @{B}Amiga@{UB} users who do not  have a
user  group in their locality register with us. We then put them in contact with
other  @{B}Amiga@{UB} users near them or inform them of any new usergroups that may be of
interest to them.

Now  instead  of the fears that their names may be entered into our database and
forgotten  about,  @{B}AmigaSoc@{UB} lost souls can rest safe knowing that they are being
watched  by  the  @{I}Soul  Hunter@{UI}.  Using our postcode database the @{I}Soul Hunter@{UI} can
pinpoint  each  user  to  within  5 KM and match them to other lost souls in our
database. Now no @{B}Amiga@{UB} owner is really alone.

To  register  in  our  lost  souls database please visit the @{B}AmigaSoc@{UB} website at
@{B}http://uk.amigasoc.org/usergroups/exls.html@{UB}

NEWS FROM @{B}CLICKBOOM@{UB}
-------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Hello from @{B}clickBOOM@{UB}

We have good news and bad news for you this time.

1) Bad news first

@{B}Napalm@{UB} will be slightly late.
We had hoped to have it ready for Nov. 1, but that won't be possible.
We will inform you of the exact release date, but expect it not to be later than
Nov. 15.
Will it be on sale at @{B}Computer '98@{UB}?  We'll try our best.

2) Good news

You wanna be the coolest dude?
Going to @{B}Computer '98@{UB} and want to have the newest @{B}Amiga@{UB}-related apparel?

Look no further -- BOOM CAP has it all.

Made  out  of soft flexible brushed cotton, this high quality embroidered cap is
rounder and lower in style than the traditional cotton baseball caps. So, not is
it only ultra-comfy, but it's also the first item with new @{B}clickBOOM@{UB} logo.

Visit @{B}http://clickboom.com@{UB} for more information.

Best regards,

@{B}clickBOOM@{UB}

@{B}THE LAST PATRIOT@{UB}: THE FIRST GAME PLANNED FOR THE @{B}OS5PROD@{UB} MACHINES
-----------------------------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

@{B}Delsyd  Software@{UB}  would  like  to announce the development of a new game for the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}---@{B}The  Last  Patriot@{UB}.  After  7 months of planning and design work, we are
ready  to  get  going.  @{B}The  Last Patriot@{UB} will be a puzzle-oriented first-person
perspective  shooter. Instead of just mindless running and shooting, you'll have
to  think  before you act, and we don't mean flipping switches, either. @{B}The Last
Patriot@{UB}  will  feature  the most advanced artificial intelligence EVER seen in a
video  game.  Each  enemy  will  have  their  own  very basic thought processes,
instincts, and personalities. We are shooting for a March 2000 release date, and
it  will  be released for the @{B}NG Amiga@{UB}. This date could get pushed back some due
to  development system/@{B}Amiga NG@{UB} delays. We're putting all of our money into this
project, and we think you'll enjoy the end product.

@{B}PPC@{UB}  versions  are  being  considered.  We would like to hear some feedback from
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  gamers. If you have any questions or ideas concerning @{B}The Last Patriot@{UB} or
@{B}Delsyd Software@{UB}, we can be reached at @{I}delsydsoftware@yahoo.com@{UI}

We  would  also  like to announce the October issue of @{B}Amiga Issues@{UB}, our monthly
forum  that  deals  with  some  of  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s more controversial issues. This
month's  topic involves @{B}Vulcan Software@{UB} and their recent software cancellations.
@{B}Amiga Issues@{UB} also contains "The Software Accelerator's Corner", where each month
we review a new patch or software tweak to keep your @{B}Amiga@{UB} moving. And, there is
also  a  section  dedicated  to  responses  that our readers have sent us. We'll
include  any  letter  that you send to @{B}Amiga Issues@{UB}, even if we don't agree with
your opinion.

All    of    this    information   can   be   found   on   our   web   page   at
@{B}www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/foothills/2705/index.html@{UB}

We hope to hear from you very soon. See ya!

@{B}PAXTRON@{UB} OFFERS INEXPENSIVE BATTERY INSURANCE FOR YOUR AGING @{B}AMIGA@{UB}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

@{I}WARNING - LEAKING BATTERIES@{UI}

@{B}LITHIUM TYPE@{UB}

Almost  20%  of  the  repairs  that our service center performs are due to aging
batteries,  which  leak  acid  on  @{B}Amiga@{UB} boards. Once the acid leaks the tracers
become  corroded  and dissolve. It is very expensive to bring the boards back to
life.

If  your  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  computer  is approaching 4 years old we suggest you replace the
original  Ni/Cd  battery  with  a new lithium battery. The new lithium batteries
will  last  longer,  has twice the amperage (150 mA as opposed to 60mA) and will
give  you  years  of trouble free service. The cost of the new exact replacement
lithium battery is $14.95 each plus shipping.

It is worth the investment of $14.95 to save a $900.00 motherboard?

@{B}NI/CD TYPE@{UB}

For those of you who want to stay with the rechargeable Ni/Cd batteries. We have
just  received  a  shipment  of fresh batteries from Germany. The Ni/Cd like the
lithium  above  must be soldered to the board. The Ni/Cd 3.6 volt battery is the
exact  Ni/Cd  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  replacement and is made by @{B}Varta@{UB}. The price of the Ni/Cd is
$9.95 plus shipping.

@{B}PROJECT OPERA@{UB} FOR @{B}AMIGA@{UB} HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD
--------------------------------------------

As you probably know there are three major browsers for @{B}Amiga@{UB}: @{B}Aweb@{UB}, @{B}Ibrowse@{UB} and
@{B}Voyager@{UB}.  Taking into account that the conversion of @{B}Netscape@{UB} for @{B}Amiga@{UB} seems to
be  not  viable, another option was the conversion of the @{B}Opera@{UB} browser. As this
conversion  was  oficially  announced  in May and we heard no news from then on,
probably you have been waiting patiently for news from the @{B}Amiga@{UB} versions.

According  to  @{I}Tim  Corringham@{UI},  the  head  of  the @{B}Amiga@{UB} development team, that
project  has  been  put  on  hold  because the entire @{B}Amiga@{UB} market seems to have
collapsed.  Mags  have gone out of business, no new information about the future
is forthcoming, and sales are next to dead.

They  are  now waiting for the Cologne Fair to see if it's worth continuing with
the project of stopping it altogether.

While the @{B}BeOS@{UB} and @{B}Psion@{UB} version are making good progress, and the project @{B}Magic@{UB}
initiator & coordinator, is confident that the very same will happen with @{B}MacOS@{UB},
@{B}OS/2@{UB}  and  @{B}Linux@{UB} (they will just take longer than anticipated), @{B}Amiga@{UB} remains to
be  seen.  The  market  is  still  out  there,  but  if it's not growing or even
remaining  stagnant,  then there may be little point in continuing, although the
initial   response   from  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  community  has  been  very  positive  and
encouraging.

Now  if you think that prefunding the individual projects is indeed a good idea,
then please let it know at @{I}magic@operasoftware.com@{UI}

@{B}MUIBASE V1.0@{UB} ANNOUNCED
----------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Freiburg (Germany), 26. October 1998.

Dear @{B}Amiga@{UB}-Community,

I  am  very  pleased  to  announce  the  availability  of  @{B}MUIbase  V1.0@{UB}, a new,
relational,  flexible  and  very powerful database for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} system. @{B}MUIbase@{UB}
uses  -  as  you  might  already  have  guessed - the @{B}Magic User Interface@{UB} for a
powerful  and  highly  customize-able  user  interface.  This  together with its
internal  programming  language,  which uses a lisp-oriented paradigm, gives you
the maximum control and power for organizing and maintaining your personal data,
ranging  from  storing your CD-collections to fully-automated finance management
systems.  @{B}MUIbase@{UB} also offers SELECT-FROM-WHERE queries, a must-have feature for
relational databases!

As  of  today  no similar database package has been shown up that offers similar
capabilities  than  @{B}MUIbase@{UB}! Check it out, a demo version is available on @{B}Aminet@{UB}
or from:
@{B}http://www.amigaworld.com/support/muibase/@{UB}

@{I}Steffen Gutmann@{UI}

@{I}Features@{UI}

@{B}MUIbase@{UB}  is a fast and very flexible database for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. It is for users who
want to manage data in a comfortable and easy way. @{B}MUIbase@{UB} is able to manage any
kind of data, e.g. addresses, CD series, movies, or your income and expense. The
power of @{B}MUIbase@{UB} lies in its clear and powerful graphical user interface and its
programming   capabilities.  The  latter  makes  it  possible  to  automatically
calculate and maintain nearly everything, starting from automatically summing up
values,  e.g.  for calculating the total amount of income or the total amount of
recorded time of a CD, up to automatically creating and printing letters for any
purpose.

@{B}MUIbase@{UB}  is  the  successor  of  @{B}AmigaBase@{UB}, a hierarchical programmable database
which is still available but considered obsolete with the appearance of @{B}MUIbase@{UB}.
All registered users of @{B}AmigaBase@{UB} can get a free upgrade to @{B}MUIbase@{UB}.

@{B}MUIbase@{UB} offers the following features:
  * Handling of multiple projects at the same time.
  * Attributes  can  be  of  type string, memo (multi line text), integer, real,
    date,  time,  bool, choice (one item out of many items), reference (easy way
    to  reference  a  record  of  another  table),  button (for starting @{B}MUIbase@{UB}
    programs), and virtual (compute value on the fly).
  * The string type can also manage lists of strings, files, and fonts. An @{B}OS3.x@{UB}
    datatype gadget allows displaying external images.
  * Unlimited number of records.
  * Dynamic  loading  of  records.  Records  which are not needed may be flushed
    from memory (e.g. when memory is low).
  * Programmability.  With  the  easy  and powerful @{B}MUIbase@{UB} programming language
    complex   tasks   can   be   implemented.   The  language  also  includes  a
    SELECT-FROM-WHERE query for easy and fast data retrieval.
  * Ordering of records by any combinations of attributes.
  * Flexible and powerful search and filter facility.
  * Query  editor  which  allows  entering  and  managing  of  SELECT-FROM-WHERE
    queries. The queries can be saved and the results can be printed.
  * Import and export facility.
  * Uses  @{B}MUI@{UB}  as user interface. The interface is highly customizable. External
    images can be included in the user interface.
  * Portability.  @{B}MUIbase@{UB}  development  has  been  done  under  the idea of easy
    portability.  The  system/gui  part  has been separated from the ANSI/C part
    such  that  porting @{B}MUIbase@{UB} will result in only porting the system/gui part.
    This is no promise that @{B}MUIbase@{UB} will ever get ported to another system, only
    the porting task has been made easier but may still be complicated depending
    on the target system/gui. But, indeed, I am thinking of a @{B}Java@{UB} port.

The unregistered version of @{B}MUIbase@{UB} is crippled in several ways. See the @{B}MUIbase@{UB}
documentation for a list of limitations in the unregistered version.

@{B}NEWTEK@{UB} CIRCUMVENTS @{B}4000@{UB} SHORTAGE
--------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

@{B}Newtek@{UB} has done it!!!!!

The  special  @{B}Toaster@{UB}/@{B}Flyer@{UB}  systems  at fantastic prices, announced by @{B}Newtek@{UB} a
while ago and then made not available because of the @{B}Amiga@{UB} non-availability, are
back!!!   @{B}Newtek@{UB}   has   made   arrangements  for  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  Towers,  suitable  for
@{B}Toaster@{UB}/@{B}Flyer@{UB}  application  to  be  manufactured from existing @{B}A1200@{UB} boards with
expansion and modification for card slots and system add-ons.

The  tower system included will run on a @{B}68060@{UB} running at 50MHz and will include
a  4GB  hard drive, a 32X CDRom, HighDensity floppy, and a 300 watt power supply
all  in  an eight bay tower. Best of all the one year warrantee is from and will
be honored by @{B}Newtek@{UB}.

@{B}Infotronic@{UB}'s Prices and available systems:
  * @{B}Video Toaster@{UB} and @{B}Flyer@{UB} in the new @{B}Amiga@{UB} Tower: $4795
  * A  Complete  @{B}Flyer@{UB}  System,  the  system described above with two 18GB Video
    Drives and a 2GB Audio drive:  $7795
  * A  Complete  @{B}Toaster@{UB}  System,  The  @{B}Toaster 4000@{UB} installed in one of the new
    @{B}Amiga@{UB} Tower Systems: $3395

These  can  be  ordered  at  any  time but @{B}Newtek@{UB}s first order, for mid-November
delivery  must  be  submitted  today  so  anyone interested in getting in on the
initial  batch  must  order within the next few hours. It is my feeling that the
success of this approach is going to depend very much on how many people respond
to the initial offering.

@node not15 "BOXER UPDATE"

@{B}BOXER@{UB} UPDATE
------------

@{B}Blittersoft@{UB}  are  very  aware  of  the  interest  the  new @{B}BoXeR@{UB} motherboard has
generated  world  wide  since  it's announcement. Unfortunately, for a number of
reasons  we  cannot  go into, there has been several unexpected delays that have
prevented it's release.

We would therefore like to make a statement to clarify the current situation.

The  @{B}BoXeR@{UB}  motherboard  is being developed by @{B}Access Innovation Ltd@{UB}. @{B}Access@{UB} are
also  involved  in  several  other  important projects, including the @{B}Inside-Out@{UB}
board  and  therefore  development  time has been spread accordingly. The delays
have   however   allowed   some  further  improvements  to  the  original  @{B}BoXeR@{UB}
specification. These changes (subject to change) are detailed below:
  * 64-bit design for maximum performance with @{B}PPC@{UB}/@{B}G3@{UB} processor boards
  * Twin  independant  IDE  ports  supporting  Modes  PIO 0-4, DMA Modes 0-2 and
    upgradable  (via  Flash)  to  UDMA,  giving  high  transfer  rates  with low
    processor overhead
  * Replacement of the Buster chip
  * Full  Parallel  port  implementation  (allowing  use  of  more parallel port
    peripherals
  * Board layout change to accomodate @{B}Video Toaster@{UB}
  * Implementation of enhancements to increase CHIP RAM access times

A  new  prototype  board  is about to go into production allowing all the latest
design  features to be tested and also prove earlier changes. Once the prototype
has  been  built  and on completion of preliminary testing we will have a better
idea of production schedules and will keep everyone informed.

The  @{B}BoXeR@{UB} motherboard delivers a medium cost home/semi-professional Multi-Media
computing  motherboard  based  on  the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Chip Set and Operating System. This
will allow complete machines to be priced between the @{B}A1200@{UB} and @{B}A4000@{UB}, providing
low  purchase  price  and  expansion  options, while delivering a performance in
excess of the @{B}A4000@{UB}.

The expected release date for the @{B}BoXeR@{UB} motherboard is Q1 1999

The @{B}BoXeR@{UB} will be sold in three ways:
  * As the heart of the new @{B}Blittersoft@{UB} range of @{B}"Black Box"@{UB} @{B}Amiga@{UB} systems.
  * As  a single motherboard solution to the customer, to build their own unique
    system.
  * Through  OEM  dealers  who  may  customise  the unit to their own particular
    markets.

@{I}Technical Information List (May change without notice):@{UI}
  * 100% @{B}Amiga@{UB} compatible.
  * Baby-AT  motherboard  based  on  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  technology - fits in ANY standard @{B}PC@{UB}
    Desktop/Tower case.
  * @{B}Motorola 68040@{UB} or @{B}68060@{UB} at 25-75MHz supported in a single processor socket.
  * On board 2Mb CHIP RAM.
  * 4 x 72 pin standard SIMM sockets allowing up to 2Gb FAST RAM.
  * Dual IDE Hard disk interface, with standard pitch 40 pin header.
  * Flash  ROM  2Mb,  32  bit wide. Used to provide @{B}kickstart@{UB} ROM's and resident
    modules.
  * Floppy  disk  drive  interface, operating as DF0:, including 0.5sec delay on
    RDY.
  * CD-ROM audio input connector and mixer.
  * Real Time Clock, using NiCad.
  * Keyboard port is a standard DIN connector for @{B}PC@{UB} compatible keyboard.
  * 2 x 16 bit @{B}Active ISA@{UB} slots, in-line with 4 x @{B}Zorro 3@{UB} slots.
  * @{B}Amiga@{UB} Video slot

@{I}Connectors@{UI}
  * Printer port, 26 pin header.
  * AV slot - provides audio, composite and RGB signals.
  * RGB video (on rear AV board).
  * Serial port 10 pin header
  * Joystick and mouse port, 10 pin headers.
  * Audio header, 4x1.
  * Power In - standard PC 12 pin connector
  * IDE - 40 pin (Dual)
  * Floppy drive DF0:/DF1: header.

@{I}Key Design Points@{UI}
  * The  all-new leading-edge design uses the @{B}AGA@{UB} chip set for compatibility but
    has  completely redesigned logic to achieve the highest performance and most
    flexible design.
  * Supports @{B}68040@{UB} or @{B}68060@{UB} from 25MHz - 75MHz.
  * Designed to achieve low system cost.
  * Supports 4x standard 72 pin SIMM's for total FAST memory of 2Gb.
  * High-speed CHIP memory read/write technology which can boost access by up to
    30%.
  * Mounts  in standard @{B}PC@{UB} baby-AT case. (Huge selection of cases available from
    a wide range of suppliers at the lowest price points)
  * Processor  connector to support a low cost @{B}PowerPC@{UB} upgrade (in development).
    This  expansion  allows  the  on-board  @{B}680x0@{UB} to remain in place so that the
    upgrade is little more than a @{B}PowerPC@{UB} on a card.
  * MPEG/Genlock   module   with  high  quality  output  and  broadcast  quality
    genlocking is in development.
  * Has  live  working  16-bit ISA slots to support low cost peripherals such as
    Modems, Ethernet and Sound cards.

@{B}CLICKBOOM@{UB} WILL NEVER RELEASE A @{B}PPC@{UB} VERSION OF @{B}QUAKE@{UB}
---------------------------------------------------

Probably,  you  are  already aware of the existance of an illegal @{B}PPC@{UB} version of
@{B}Quake@{UB}.  On  Friday,  a legal self-styled @{B}Quake PPC@{UB} version coming from @{B}clickBOOM@{UB}
appeared  in  @{B}Aminet@{UB}. Actually, it is the same illegal version. @{B}clickBOOM@{UB} is fed
up  of  this  situation,  and  they  stated  that  a legal version will never be
released. For your information, this is the short statement which has been taken
from their WEB site:

@{I}"So called "@{B}Quake PPC@{UB}" on @{B}Aminet@{UB} is illegal and not coming from @{B}clickBOOM@{UB}.
This idiotic move by some no-brain imbecil now made it official there will be no
@{B}Quake PPC@{UB} coming from @{B}clickBOOM@{UB}.
No one better even think about flaming us for this decision."@{UI}

@{B}ESCENA@{UB} ANNOUNCES NEW @{B}G3 PPC@{UB} BOARDS
----------------------------------

Dear @{B}Amiga@{UB} User,

this is the current issue of the @{B}HAAGE&PARTNER@{UB} NEWS.

@{I}05-Nov.-98: @{B}ESCENA@{UB} announces new @{B}G3 PPC@{UB} boards!@{UI}

German  company  @{B}ESCENA@{UB}  which  has  many  years  of  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  hardware experience
(hardware  developments  for  @{B}DCE@{UB},  @{B}IBH@{UB}  and  others) are going to introduce the
prototype  of  their  new  @{B}G3 PowerPC@{UB} board at @{B}Computer '98@{UB}. It is a @{B}G3@{UB}-@{B}ZorroIII@{UB}
board  (without  a  @{B}68k@{UB} CPU) which fits into the @{B}A3000@{UB}/@{B}4000@{UB} and @{B}A1200@{UB} with @{B}Zorro@{UB}
extension.  The  board can take processors from 233 to 400 MHz with 512KB or 1MB
Backside  cache and up to 512MB SDRAM. It will use the @{B}WarpUP@{UB} driver package and
the  @{B}68k@{UB}  emulator  of  @{B}Haage&Partner@{UB}.  The prototypes are produced by @{B}DCE@{UB}. More
information  will  be  available  soon at the homepage of @{B}ESCENA@{UB} and at @{B}Computer
'98@{UB}.

@{I}05-Nov-98: @{B}AmigaWriter 1.2@{UB} Demo@{UI}

We just released the new demo version 1.2 of @{B}AmigaWriter@{UB}. The patch for the full
version will be available soon. The key features are spell checking and document
templates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{B}Linux 5.1@{UB}

@{B}Linux@{UB}  is a free @{B}Unix@{UB}-type operating system originally created by @{I}Linus Torvalds@{UI}
with  the  assistance  of  developers  around the world. @{B}Linux@{UB} is an independent
@{B}POSIX@{UB}  implementation  and  includes  true  multitasking, virtual memory, shared
libraries,  demand  loading,  proper  memory  management, TCP/IP networking, and
other  features  consistent  with  @{B}Unix@{UB}-type  systems.  Developed  under the @{B}GNU
General  Public  License@{UB},  the  source  code  for  @{B}Linux@{UB}  is freely available to
everyone.

This  CD-ROM  contains  the unofficial @{B}RedHat 5.1 Amiga@{UB}-Version (binaries only!)
ported  by  @{I}Jes  Sorensen@{UI}.  The source code is available upon request. Technical
support is provided free of charge via phone (English & German spoken).

@{I}System Requirements@{UI}
  * @{B}Linux@{UB}  can  be  installed  on  almost any @{B}Amiga@{UB} (or @{B}Atari@{UB}) having a @{B}68030@{UB} or
    better  (@{B}68020@{UB}  only  if  you  also have a @{B}68851 PMMU@{UB}). You must also have a
    math-coprocessor (which is built-into @{B}68040@{UB} and higher CPU's).
  * Although @{B}Linux@{UB} is not really a memory hog, you should have at least 8-meg of
    system memory before trying to install @{B}Linux@{UB}.
  * Second, you must have a supported disk controller. At this time @{B}RedHat m68k
    Linux@{UB} supports the following SCSI/IDE disk controllers:
      * @{B}Commodore A3000@{UB} internal.
      * @{B}Commodore A2091@{UB}.
      * @{B}Commodore A4091@{UB}/@{B}A4000T@{UB}.
      * @{B}GVP HC8-II@{UB} series (including @{B}G-Force@{UB} accelerators).
      * @{B}MacroSystems WarpEngine@{UB}.
      * @{B}Phase5 Cyberstorm MkI@{UB}.
      * @{B}Phase5 Cyberstorm MkII@{UB}.
      * @{B}Phase5 Blizzard 1230IV@{UB} / @{B}1260@{UB}.
      * @{B}Phase5 Blizzard 2040@{UB} / @{B}2060@{UB}.
      * @{B}Atari@{UB} native SCSI.
      * @{B}A1200@{UB} / @{B}A4000@{UB} native IDE.
  * @{B}Linux@{UB}  was  designed with networking in mind. At this time @{B}RedHat m68k Linux@{UB}
    supports the following network adapters:
      * @{B}Commodore A2065@{UB}.
      * @{B}VillageTronic Ariadne@{UB}.
      * @{B}Hydra@{UB}.
      * @{B}A1200 PCMCIA NE2000@{UB}.
      * @{B}Atari Lance@{UB}.
      * @{B}Atari Bionet-100@{UB}.
      * @{B}Atari Pamsnet@{UB}.
  * The  following  is  an  (incomplete) list of @{B}Amiga@{UB} boards NOT yet supported.
    Anyone wishing to hack at driver modules is encouraged to do so.
      * All @{B}Apollo@{UB} accelerators.
      * @{B}DKB Wildfire@{UB} (@{B}060@{UB}).
      * @{B}Phase5 Cyberstorm MkIII@{UB} (@{B}060@{UB}).

@{B}MAXON COMPUTERS@{UB} STOP ALL DEVELOPMENT CONCERNING THE @{B}AMIGA@{UB}
---------------------------------------------------------

Dear @{B}Amiga@{UB}-Users,

Since  the  middle  of  the  ninetees  there have been hot discussions about the
future of the @{B}AMIGA@{UB}.

Unfortunately  a  lot of them turned out to be nothing but hot air - mostly good
ideas with no functioning concepts.

Even  if  there  were  some  moments  of  hope in the last few years, all of the
development turned out to be more complex in reality than it was planned. So the
economical needs forced us to make some decisions.

We had to decide to stop all further activities concerning the @{B}AMIGA@{UB}.

At  the  last  trade shows we have often answered the question for a port to the
@{B}PowerUP@{UB}-Platform  with  "As  soon  as we get suitable developing-tools." - These
tools  still  aren't available. For an application as complex as @{B}CINEMA4D@{UB}, these
tools  are  totally  essential.  Without an object-oriented programming language
like @{B}C++@{UB} a useful port is not possible - the existing hardware is already at its
limits with the available version 4.

As  a company involved with the @{B}AMIGA@{UB} since 1986, which has been a market-leader
in  raytracing-software,  and  which  has produced a lot of books as well as the
German "@{B}Kickstart@{UB}"-magazine for the @{B}AMIGA@{UB}-market, it is even more hard to make a
decision.

Actually  the  last few results of the @{B}AMIGA@{UB} events in London and Toronto showed
that  there  will  be no general improvement of the situation in the next years.
Too  much  decisions took too much time, wrong decisions lead into dead ends and
too many parties acted uncoordinated.

Making  Plans  is  a  great thing - but in such a fast-changing economy like the
computer-business 2 years are a very long time - too long.

A  market  that  only  sells  a  few units a year makes it difficult to maintain
profitable,  which  is  absolute  must for a company that has to take social and
financial care about its staff and employees.

So  we  had  to  change  our  plans  and  @{B}CINEMA  4D@{UB}  has  concentrated  on  the
high-end-market  in  the  last  years,  where it has reached a safe top-position
worldwide.  Today  a  lot  of  big  TV-stations and production-studios are using
@{B}CINEMA  4D@{UB} and it's getting constantly the best marks and the most wanted awards
(e.g.  @{B}Siggraph  1997@{UB}  - "Best Animation-Tool: @{B}CINEMA 4D XL@{UB}"). And as we want to
fulfill  the  needs  of  this  market  in  the  future,  this  means  continuous
development.

We say goodbye and send out best wishes to you for the future.

Your

@{B}MAXON Computer GmbH@{UB}

POSITIVE NEWS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF @{B}OPERA@{UB} FOR @{B}AMIGA@{UB}
------------------------------------------------------

The  last  week  we informed you that the @{B}Amiga@{UB} version of @{B}Opera@{UB} had been put on
hold. Fortunately, several interesting - and positive - things have emerged.

Based on the latest correspondence between @{I}Tim Corringham@{UI}, the head of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
development  team, and @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} as well as them at @{B}Opera Software@{UB}, things seem
to  look up. Not only is @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} very supportive of their initiative, but the
@{B}Amiga@{UB} community has also pledged its continuous support.

The  progress on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} port has been substantial. The plan is now to use the
Cologne  Fair as another benchmark, but people are confident that the @{B}Amiga@{UB} port
will continue and be completed soon.

@{B}VULCAN@{UB} CLOSES THE @{B}AMIGA@{UB} DEVELOPMENT AFTER 5 YEARS OF EXISTANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------

@{I}GOODBYE @{B}AMIGA@{UB} CLASSIC@{UI}

@{B}Vulcan@{UB}  is finally closing the lid on @{B}Amiga@{UB} (classic) software development after
half  a  decade  of  support!  The  decision to leave comes close to @{B}Vulcan@{UB}s 5th
anniversary.

@{I}Paul  Carrington@{UI}  states  @{I}"...after  much deliberation we switched off our @{B}Amiga@{UB}
development  systems  at  the mains, quickly wrapped them in brown paper and hid
them  in  the  @{B}Vulcan@{UB} vault! It's quite sad to see these babies being turned off
but it is something we all knew was inevitable (and perhaps long overdue)."@{UI}

Since 1994 @{B}Vulcan@{UB} has Developed and Published 10 @{B}Amiga@{UB} floppy titles and 5 @{B}Amiga@{UB}
CDRom titles and currently has 2 more @{B}Amiga@{UB} CDRom titles still in production and
nearing release.

@{I}"I  hope  that  our departure from @{B}Amiga@{UB} (classic) software development does not
receive  the  same  insulting  and  slanderous  response  as  previous departing
companies  had experienced, but our decision is based purely on a commercial and
financial  level  due to the current state of the existing @{B}Amiga@{UB} market. To show
our loyalty to the platform (which was responsible for our companies success) we
will  remain  as  an  active  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  Publisher  as  long  as  there are external
developers  out there creating exciting products and require our services and as
long  as our @{B}Amiga@{UB} distributor still has an outlet to sell limited quantities of
@{B}Amiga@{UB} titles."@{UI}

@{B}Vulcan@{UB}  has  just  released  a  limited  edition @{B}Amiga@{UB} compilation CDRom of it's
MiniSeries  titles  as a tribute to it's golden days and we can still expect the
Alien  adventure  @{B}'Wasted Dreams' Amiga@{UB} CDRom to be released before Xmas 98 with
@{B}Explorer2260 Amiga PPC@{UB} CDRom scheduled for early 99.

Live Long & Prosper!

@{B}Directory Opus 5 Magellan II@{UB}

From  its  first  release in early '95, many @{B}Amiga@{UB} users have seen the raw power
provided  by  @{B}Opus  5@{UB}  with its unique concept integrating @{B}Workbench Replacement
Mode@{UB}  (tm),  file  management  and  custom  functions  in the one package. These
concepts were further refined in the @{B}Opus 5@{UB} release in May '96 and @{B}Opus Magellan@{UB}
in  1997.  During  this  time  of  great uncertainty for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} platform as a
whole, we have been buoyed by the support of @{B}Opus@{UB} users, many of whom have given
us  continual encouragement as well as much valuable feedback and suggestions on
future directions for @{B}Opus 5@{UB}.

Through  your  support  @{B}Opus 5@{UB} has now become firmly established as the  premier
workbench replacement and file management program for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

Thanks!

Dr. @{I}Greg Perry@{UI}, @{B}GP Software@{UB}

With  this  new  version  we  have attempted to return your loyalty with ongoing
support  for  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB} platform and a continuation of our development plan for
@{B}Opus  5@{UB}.  We have also tried to add as many of your user suggestions as possible
which are consistent with the metaphor of @{B}Opus@{UB}.

We  hope you will enjoy the advanced features in this new version which we  call
the @{B}Directory Opus 5 Magellan II@{UB} version.

@{I}Summary of Enhancements:@{UI}

The  @{B}Magellan  II@{UB}  version  is not just a simple upgrade but the product of more
than 12 months of intensive development of many components of the  @{B}Opus 5@{UB} system
and  enthusiastic  testing by our beta testers. This version  gives you many new
features  with  superior useability especially in @{B}Workbench Replacement Mode@{UB}(tm)
plus  many new features such as themes, sound events, extended configuration and
better usage of background images to name but a few.

After  extensive  testing we have also improved the compatibility with @{B}Workbench@{UB}
and  other  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  programs.  A  completely rewritten @{B}OpusFTP@{UB} module complements
these changes and not only gives you easier access to the Internet but now has a
much better GUI for the address book and  operational parameters.

  * Enhanced Lister functionality including:
      * Usage of proportional fonts

  * Themes  -  configure  your  System  with your favourite graphics, sounds and
    fonts
  * Revised and more intuitive layout of environment editors
  * Background pictures in button banks and start menus
  * Random background images
  * New Outline and Shadow font options for workbench display
  * Fully user configurable screen title with many options
  * Configurable sound events - attach a sound to inserting or removing a disk
  * New Opus internal file paths
  * Support for Filesystems with filenames up to 107 characters
  * New graphical layout and better configurability of Button banks
  * Revised internal commands, many now replaceable by user
  * Enhanced Scripts system with better linking to internal commands and OpusFTP

@{B}Amiga Envoy 3@{UB}

@{B}Amiga  Envoy@{UB}  is  the  only networking software specifically designed for  @{B}Amiga@{UB}
computers.  It  allows  you  to  access resources like files and  directories on
connected  @{B}Amiga@{UB} computers as if they were on a local disk. Naturally, this also
includes removable media support. Printing over the network is also a feature of
@{B}Amiga  Envoy@{UB}. A single printer can even be  accessed by multiple @{B}Amiga@{UB} computers
simultaneously.

Via security and management features, you can also set up access restrictions in
a flexible way for multiple users.

@{B}Amiga  Envoy@{UB}  is  easy  to  use  and  easy  to configure with its font sensitive
graphical user interface. Contrary to common types of networking software, there
is no need to restart after changing any configuration settings.

The  open  programmer's  interface  of @{B}Amiga@{UB} Envoy allows you to add your own or
freely  redistributable  extensions and services to, e.g., update date  and time
from a remote @{B}Amiga@{UB} computer or even use a remote @{B}Amiga@{UB} computer with your local
keyboard and screen. All the required documentation is  included.

@{B}Amiga  Envoy@{UB} requires @{B}OS 2.04@{UB} or higher, at least 1MB of memory, and any @{B}SANA-II@{UB}
compliant networking hardware. A harddisk is recommended.

Happy networking!

@{I}Heinz Wrobel@{UI}

An  @{B}Amiga Envoy@{UB} CD-ROM contains a licence to network two @{B}Amiga@{UB} computers. To add
more  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  computers  to the network you have to buy the appropriate amount of
additional licences. Never forget: Piracy kills the @{B}Amiga@{UB}!

@{B}FMSX AMIGA 2.0@{UB} RELEASED!
------------------------

@{I}TITLE@{UI}

fMSX Amiga 2.0

@{I}AUTHOR@{UI}

@{I}Hans Guijt@{UI} (@{I}hguijt@inter.nl.net@{UI})

@{I}DESCRIPTION@{UI}

@{B}fMSX Amiga@{UB} emulates an @{B}MSX@{UB} computer on an @{B}Amiga@{UB}. Features include:
  * Full emulation of the @{B}MSX1@{UB} system.
  * Full emulation of the @{B}MSX2@{UB} system.
  * Support for reading/writing @{B}MSX@{UB} disks and disk images.
  * Can play all types of @{B}MSX@{UB} ROMs, including ROMs bigger than 32KB.
  * Support for the @{B}PSG@{UB}, @{B}SCC@{UB}, and @{B}FM-Pac@{UB} sound chips (through @{B}AHI@{UB} or native).
  * Support for @{B}MSX@{UB} memory sizes of up to 4Mb.
  * Can be controlled through @{B}ARexx@{UB}.

'@{UB}MSX@{UB}'  is  an  8-bit  computer  system with surprisingly good graphics and sound
capabilities.  How does graphic resolutions of up to 512 * 424, up to 256 colors
on screen, and 9 channel music sound?

To  demonstrate,  several @{UB}MSX@{UB} pictures (taken from @{UB}fMSX@{UB} while running) have been
uploaded to @{B}aminet@{UB} (pix/illu/msx_emu.lha).

Software  is not included with the package, but many packages (mostly games) can
be found on FTP sites:
     @{B}ftp.saitama-u.ac.jp/pub/msx/@{UB}
     @{B}altair.komkon.com/pub/MSX/@{UB}
     @{B}ftp.funet.fi/pub/msx/@{UB}
     @{B}riaph.irkutsk.su/pub/@{UB}

Hundreds  of  games  are  available  from  these  sites,  and some form a worthy
addition to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} software collection.

Of course @{UB}fMSX Amiga@{UB} is fully multitasking, runs in an intuition screen, and has
a font-sensitive, resizable user interface.

@{I}NEW FEATURES@{UI}

A  year  and a half in the making, you might expect a few changes. Well, nothing
is further from the truth!

This  version  of @{B}fMSX@{UB} is almost a new program. Entire modules were written from
scratch, most notably the video and CPU emulations.

Most  spectacular from a code point of view is the Dynamic Recompiler. This is a
complicated   piece   of   software  that  turns  @{B}Z80@{UB}  instructions  into  @{B}680x0@{UB}
instructions  on  the  fly,  before  executing them. Translated instructions are
cached  and  reused  when  needed. The net result? More configurability and more
speed.  Unfortunately,  it  is not yet as compatible as the old @{B}Z80@{UB} emulator, so
some  games  will not run on it. @{B}68060@{UB} owners will love it though, as it can run
at very precise speeds (previous versions could be astonishingly fast on @{B}68060@{UB}).

Also  rewritten  from  scratch  were  the display routines. Two complete sets of
routines  are now available, one for native screens (taking a few shortcuts here
and  there  for extra speed) and one for @{B}CyberGfx@{UB} mode. All @{B}MSX2@{UB} screenmodes are
supported  now, and every sprite resolution is available. The new routines are a
lot faster than before too.

Something that is _very_ useful for gamers: @{B}fMSX@{UB} can now turn a directory filled
with  @{B}MSX@{UB}  software  into  a temporary disk on the fly. Just enter the name of a
directory  into  one  of the "drive" gadgets, and the contents of that directory
are  written onto a temporary disk, ready for your use. @{UB}fMSX@{UB} will even detect if
you need any system files, and add these automatically if required!

The  GUI  was  completely  changed. Many gadgets were given places that are more
logical (I have had quite a few complaints about this, let me tell you). The new
GUI uses the BOOPSI gadgets which are in development for @{B}Merapi@{UB}, the Java system
by @{B}Haage&Partner@{UB}. I consider @{B}fMSX@{UB} a sort of field-test, a useful testbench while
@{B}Merapi@{UB} is still waiting off stage.

Add  in support for an @{B}MSX@{UB} mouse, and (very preliminary) support for the @{B}FM-Pac@{UB}.
Add in some nifty configuration options (such as custom interrupt speeds for the
ultimate  in speed control), and a cheat finder. Add in the fact that nothing of
note  seems  to  get uploaded to @{B}Aminet@{UB} recently. All in all, it should be clear
that you simply have no choice other than to get this emulator!

@{I}SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS@{UI}

All  this  power does, unfortunately, not come without a price. Memory usage has
skyrocketed,  don't  bother  to  apply with less than 3MB. A hefty processor was
always  useful,  and  that  is still true although it should run a bit better on
slower systems as well.

@{B}fMSX@{UB}  now once again requires @{B}AmigaOS 3.0@{UB}. It could never have worked on @{B}AmigaOS
2.0@{UB},  but  since  I  didn't  receive  a single bug report I can only assume that
nobody  was  using  it. Don't bother complaining, there is a lot of @{B}3.0@{UB} stuff in
there now and I won't be taking it out.

@{B}AHI@{UB} is required for some of the sound modes.

@{I}AVAILABILITY@{UI}

@{B}fMSX    Amiga    2.0@{UB}   is   available   from   any   @{B}aminet@{UB}   site,   such   as:
@{B}ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/misc/emu/fmsx_2.0.lha@{UB}

@{I}PRICE@{UI}

All this, for free!

@{I}DISTRIBUTABILITY@{UI}

@{B}fMSX Amiga 2.0@{UB} is publically supported freeware.

Source  for  previous  versions  was available on request. However, this version
contains  some  code for @{B}Merapi@{UB} which I am not willing to share at this point in
time. You can get the source, but without the BOOPSI gadgets.

Depending on how things go with @{B}Merapi@{UB} this may change in the future.

COLOGNE"

@{B}WARP3D@{UB} AND @{B}STORMMESA@{UB} TO BE PRESENTED AT THE @{B}HAAGE&PARTNER@{UB} BOOTH AT COLOGNE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The  @{B}Computer  '98@{UB}  in Cologne will see the first public presentation of @{B}Warp3D@{UB}.
The  hardware used will be the @{B}CyberVision3D@{UB}, showing off what the comparatively
weak @{B}ViRGE@{UB} chip is capable of doing, and it will become obvious that the rumours
are  wrong:  That the @{B}ViRGE@{UB} is not suited for fast 3D graphics. You will be able
to  see  quite  a  number  of  impressive  demos to show the possibilities of 3D
Hardware.

The  @{B}PowerPC@{UB}/@{B}WarpUp@{UB}-Conversion  will  also be in beta state and will be shown at
the  fair.  The  combination  of  @{B}PowerPC@{UB}  and 3D-Chips will result in an as yet
unseen performance in 3D computer graphics on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} sector.

As  a  second  highliht in the 3D realm will be the presentation of the graphics
library  @{B}StormMesa  3.0@{UB}.  This  library implements the @{B}OpenGL@{UB} API, and will be a
powerful  tool  for the development of 3D software. Version 3.0 will come in the
form of shared libraries for both types of CPU (@{B}68k@{UB}, @{B}PPC@{UB}).

Usually  @{B}OpenGL@{UB}-Software  requires very powerful hardware. Because of this, good
performance  can  only  be  achieved  if  all  system components work flawlessly
together.  For the first time in Cologne you will be able to see the combination
of  @{B}OpenGL@{UB}  and  3D  Hardware for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. @{B}StormMesa 3.0@{UB} will contain a driver
that  uses  the  @{B}Warp3D@{UB}-APU  and thus redirects 3D rendering to the 3D hardware.
This  will  finally  set the stage for porting e.g. @{B}OpenGL@{UB}-supporting games from
other platforms with a minimal effort in time and money.

We  invite  you to visit our booth and to see for yourself what it means to have
top  software and top hardware working together. See the combination of @{B}PowerPC@{UB},
3D-Hardware,  @{B}WarpOS@{UB}, @{B}Warp3D@{UB} and @{B}OpenGL@{UB}/@{B}StormMesa@{UB}, and see the @{B}Amiga@{UB} turned into
a top machine again.

resembles  many  of  @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s  unique  qualities.  It  provides the foundation in
reaching our vision for the rebirth of @{B}Amiga@{UB} in the new millenium."@{UI}

@{I}"We  see this partnership as a powerful combination of superior OS technologies,
common  corporate  cultures  and  shared business vision"@{UI}, said @{I}Dan Dodge@{UI}, Chief
Technology Officer and Co-Founder of @{B}QNX Software Systems Ltd.@{UB}

Building  upon  the  @{B}QNX@{UB}  OS  foundation,  @{B}Amiga, Inc.@{UB} will work with @{B}QNX@{UB} to add

@{I}Frequently Asked Questions@{UI}

@{B}Q@{UB}: @{I}Should @{B}Amiga@{UB} developers start programming for @{B}QNX@{UB} now?@{UI}
@{B}A@{UB}:  No.  While  @{B}QNX@{UB} is the foundation OS, @{B}Amiga@{UB} in partnership with @{B}QNX@{UB} will add
user  interface  enhancements,  more  multimedia  support  and  a  host of other
convergence  features.  This  will  be  released through @{B}Amiga, Inc@{UB}'s developers
program.

@{B}Q@{UB}: @{I}Will I have to re-write my application to run on Next Generation @{B}Amiga@{UB}s?@{UI}
@{B}A@{UB}:  Yes.  The  new  OS  has  a  programming model that is similar to the Classic
@{B}Amiga@{UB}'s,  but  also  sufficiently  different. In particular, the new OS features
processes and threads (a "thread" is like an @{B}Amiga@{UB} Process/Task), virtual memory
and  a  very  clean  microkernel architecture. All access to hardware is through
drivers,  so if your application "hits the hardware" it will not work. Most well
written  applications should be able to be ported, but to take full advantage of
the  new  architecture  you will want to take advantage of the new APIs. We also
intend  to  offer  significantly  better  development  tools  than are currently
available for the classic, which should case the transition.

@{B}Q@{UB}:  @{I}How  about  my  Classic  applications? Will they run?@{UI} @{B}A@{UB}: For the Development
System,  we  are  investigating  an  "@{B}Amiga@{UB}  Classic on PCI card", resembling an
@{B}A1200@{UB}. Well behaved @{B}3.1@{UB} / @{B}3.5 Amiga@{UB} Classic applications should work.

@{B}AMIGA INC.@{UB}, @{B}AMIGA INT.@{UB} & @{B}QNX@{UB} PRESENTATIONS AVAILABLES IN VIDEO

The  @{B}Amiga  Inc.@{UB},  @{B}Amiga  International@{UB},  and  @{B}QNX@{UB}  Friday,  November  13,  1998

Parts  of this video were shown on the @{B}Computer 98@{UB} show floor Saturday, November
14, 1998. @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} used @{B}Amiga International@{UB}'s large video display wall to show
the  @{B}QNX@{UB}  demonstration.  This  is  your  chance  to see this historic event for
yourself.

@{B}Amiga  Inc.@{UB}'s  @{I}Jeff Schindler@{UI} talks about the current state of the @{B}Amiga@{UB} and the
need to work toward the future @{B}Amiga@{UB} system.

Dr.  @{I}Alan  Havemose@{UI}  gives a once in a lifetime presentation of what the current
@{B}Amiga@{UB} operating system is and what the new system will have.

The final presentation is by @{I}Dan Dodge@{UI}, President of @{B}QNX@{UB}, the software innovator
who  has been chosen as @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB}'s partner in developing the @{B}Amiga@{UB}NG operating
system.   Mr.   @{I}Dodge@{UI}   demonstrates  his  company's  current,  unique  software
capabilities and gives @{B}Amiga@{UB} users an idea of where the @{B}Amiga@{UB} market is headed.

This   is   followed   by   an   open   question  and  answer  period  from  the
standing-room-only crowd who watched the nearly two-hour event.

@{B}BGUI@{UB} TOOLKIT PROGRESS RESUMES
-----------------------------

After  changing hands once again, the development of @{B}BGUI@{UB} - the @{B}Amiga@{UB} BOOPSI GUI
toolkit  - was taken over by @{I}Manuel Lemos@{UI} early this year. Discretely, a team of
several  other  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  developers  was  gathered  to carry on the work of fixing
remaining bugs and adding new features. @{B}BGUI@{UB} is freely available as before.

A  new users mailing list was created and a dedicated Web site was brought up to
provide  access  to  new  versions  of  "bgui.library",  utilities and developer
materials.

There  is  now  also a online Bug database to let users post feature requests or
make   bug   reports  and  follow  their  evolution.  The  site  is  located  at
@{B}http://www.bgui.e-na.net/@{UB}.

If  you are willing to contribute to the development of @{B}BGUI@{UB}, feel free to apply
to  developer  status.  Once  you are approved you'll have access to @{B}BGUI@{UB} source
code  either  from  @{B}BGUI@{UB}  Web site or through a dedicated CVS server. Interested
developers should contact @{I}Manuel Lemos@{UI} (mlemos@acm.org).

@node not43 "AMIGA BODYGUARD DEVELOPMENT CEASED"

@{B}AMIGA BODYGUARD@{UB} DEVELOPMENT CEASED
----------------------------------

Dear @{I}Amiga@{UI} User,

Back in January 1998 we announced the revolutionary software @{B}Amiga BodyGuard@{UB} - a
comprehensive  memory  protection system. The release had been scheduled for May
1998  but  we  have failed to deliver this piece of software since then and thus
have had to postpone the release several times.

In  the  meantime  it  has  become  clear  that  such  product is a much greater
challenge  than  we  did  originally  anticipate.  As  it  would  contradict our
philosophy  to sell alpha-versions of @{B}Amiga BodyGuard@{UB} or to postpone the release
for  another  couple  of  months  we  have  made  the  decision  to stop further
development at this point.

Despite  this  decision,  Mr. @{I}Martin Berndt@{UI} the developer of @{B}Amiga BodyGuard@{UB} has
informed  us  that  he  intends to continue the development. It might be that he
will  be  able  to  present  a  working  commercial  release  of @{B}Amiga BodyGuard@{UB}
sometimes next year.

To receive further information you should contact Mr. @{I}Berndt@{UI} directly:
Mr.                                 Phone ++49-(0)2065-73904
@{I}Martin Berndt@{UI}     Email: @{I}berndt@i-dea.de@{UI}

47226 Duisburg	           ICQ#: 16091148

We  know  that our decision to stop the development of @{B}Amiga BodyGuard@{UB} might not
be very popular but we would like to take the opportunity to assure you that our
commitment  towards  the @{B}Amiga@{UB} will remain unchanged. During the next days alone
we'll release a large variety of new products: @{B}Directory Opus Magellan II@{UB}, @{B}DOpus
Plus@{UB}, @{B}CyberGraphX V4@{UB}, @{B}SuperView Productivity Suite@{UB}, @{B}Envoy 3@{UB}, @{B}Aminet Set 7@{UB}, @{B}Linux
5.1@{UB}, ... And our release schedule for the next months will be tight as well.

OPEN LETTER OF THANKS FROM @{B}VILLAGE TRONIC@{UB}
-----------------------------------------

Dear friends, customers and supporters.

The  @{B}Computer`98@{UB} fair is over. We are glad that so many @{B}Amiga@{UB} people visited our
booth  and  showed  support  for  our  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  products.  Thank  you all for your
enthusiasm about the @{B}Amiga@{UB} and all the products it still brings up.

As  you all might know we brought out an @{B}AVI@{UB}-animation grabber for our @{B}Paloma IV@{UB}
add  on module for @{B}Picasso IV@{UB}. Our friend @{I}Laszlo Tourouk@{UI} from Hungary visited us
for  the  whole  fair  and presented it to interested people. You can leech this
software    with    the    name    @{B}PalomAVI@{UB}   in   a   week   on   our   webpage
"@{B}http://www.villagetronic.com/amiga/@{UB}" for free. The animation player @{B}Moovid@{UB} will
be included as a shareware version.

Another thing of interest was our @{B}Voodoo@{UB} add on board for the @{B}Picasso IV@{UB} that we
showed  as an "early beta" made of paper with glued @{B}Voodoo@{UB} chips on it. Probably
you saw our survey about it.

Now  it`s  Monday and I returned more or less tired from the show... I opened my
mailfolder  to  see  how  many people contributed in our survey about the @{B}Voodoo@{UB}
card for @{B}Picasso IV@{UB}. The actual state is: 185 preorders and about 439 interests.

Now  again  I ask you all for support: Can you manage to spread this information
to  any  people that could be interested? No, you shouldn`t do "SPAM" like I did
right  now  (hello  @{B}UGN@{UB}  members, I got your adds from @{I}Tony Mees@{UI}, hope you don`t
mind)  but  if you know people that might be interested in a card like this they
should  really  preorder  here  that  we  can manage to produce it. We are still
devoted  @{B}Amiga@{UB}ns  here and we really want to make this card happen (even against
our @{B}Mac@{UB} department here :)).

Okidoo...  Here  I send you the "official" information again, that you can check
out what and how we want it.

With best regards and all the best for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} future.

Here  you will now find the text that we released before the fair in Cologne. If
you         want         to         join         our         survey        reach
"@{B}http://www.villagetronic.com/amiga/survey.html@{UB}"       or       for      germans

@{I}Survey about @{B}PicassoIV@{UB} and 3dfx @{B}Voodoo@{UB} AddOn Module@{UI}

Dear customer.

After  the development of the @{B}AriadneII@{UB} ethernet card @{B}Village Tronic@{UB} (one of the
few  remaining  hardware  companies  for  the @{B}Zorro@{UB} based @{B}Amiga@{UB} Classic computer
systems)  is  considering about the ongoing support and development of new addon
products for the graphics board @{B}PicassoIV@{UB}.

As  far  as there are no clear statements about the current @{B}Amiga@{UB} market we need
to  know how many people would show us support for the development of such a new
product. So we came to the conclusion to make a survey.

Our  aim  is  to  develop an 8MB 3d-addon board with @{B}Voodoo@{UB} chipset (3dfx). This
card  would  need  a  @{B}Zorro  III@{UB}  based @{B}Amiga@{UB} system like @{B}A4K@{UB}, @{B}A3K@{UB} or @{B}A1200@{UB} with
special  @{B}Zorro  III@{UB}  extensions.  For  us  the  point  is that we need about 500
preorders  that  shows  us  that  the  product will be viable and we can pay our
development  costs.  Now  the point is on you to fill out our survey that we can
see if there will be enough pieces sold.

Help  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  market  and you could see a modern and progressive product for
your @{B}miggy@{UB}...

(All product names are registered trademarks of the concerned producer)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes,  I preorder an 8mb @{B}Voodoo@{UB} 3d module for the @{B}Picasso IV@{UB} for the preferential
price  of  249,-DM.  If  there  won`t  be  enough  preorders and no card will be
developed this contract will become invalid. Payment will follow shipment.

Yes,  I`m  interested in an 8mb @{B}Voodoo@{UB}-3d-Module for @{B}Picasso IV@{UB}. For now I`m not
able  to  preorder but I will show my support for the idea with my signature and

COMPUTER '98: A REPORT FROM THE FLOOR
-------------------------------------

We  arrived  on  Friday  13th,  at  about  10:30 AM. The hall was pretty crowded
already,  although  I could remember more traffic from past years - but that was
on  Sundays.  PC  booths were more numerous than they used to be, and there were
much less "Amiga highlights" present. Especially the absence of Phase 5 was felt
easily.  According  to  their  own statement, this was because they would not be
able  to  show  something  really  new,  since the BVisionPPC would not be ready
before  the  end  of  November. Other sources claim that phase 5 would rather be
present at a Mac exposition held at the same time.

The booth of German distributor Schatztruhe saw the most traffic, where Magellan
II,  SuperView, CyberGraphX 4, Linux 5.1, Miami 3.2 / Deluxe, PFS II and lots of
other  goodies  were  sold  in  the dozens. Paul Nolan showed another preview of
PhotogenicsNG (when will it finally be released?), and Martin Berndt (Bodyguard,
MultiCX) was also there.

Other  well-known  distributors  saw  similar  sales,  like Vesalia, Haage &amp;
Partner  and  Oberland.  At  the Haage booth, PageStream 3.4 was the best-seller
since  the  StormC  DSK  did  not  make it into the box in time for the exhibit.
However, Haage took orders and promised to ship them - free of p&amp;p fees - as
soon as possible.

A  similar  fate  struck  at  Oberland,  where  the  Amiga  version of monzoom3D
(formerly Reflections) had a faulty installer script and thus was unavailable at
their  booth.  Oberland, too, took orders and promised not to charge p&amp;p for
the delivery.

Amiga  International,  Inc.  once again was present with their large booth, with
lots  of  VIP  standing and sitting inside and outside. Petro Tyschtschenko, who
had  kindly  invited me to a press conference scheduled for 5:00 PM (many thanks
to  him!),  was also there, talking to developers, distributors and users alike.
It  was  my  first  close  encounter  with this man, and he made a very positive
impression  on  me.  He  was  friendly,  open for questions and suggestions, and
despite  the  stress  very  calm  and  optimistic.  After  attending  the  press
conference  that  evening,  I can understand his positive mood - that was a real
ace up the sleeve, but more to that later.

The  Amiga  booth had a large video wall, where several demos showed the gfx and
sound   abilities   of  "Classic"  Amigas.  Every  now  and  then  there  was  a
presentation,  among  others with Scala MM 400, a preview of Octamed Soundstudio
v2, and the Melody1200 soundcard.

At  each  corner  of  the  Amiga booth, two Amigas showed some piece of soft- or
hardware.  Nightshift showed the excellent Scala software, and reassured me that
the  MM  300  package shipped with the A1200 "Magic" can still be upgraded to MM
400  for  the  bargain  price  of  99,-  DM  (roughly  55  USD)  by  sending the
registration  card  to  Nightshift.  He  also  showed  me some of the new MM 400
features,  like fly-on text, improved shuffler handling, an online documentation
fully done as Scala presentation, and a nice extra digital vernissage, the first
issue in a series of presentations of artists' work.

Ateo  Concepts  showed  their  AteoBus/Pixel64,  a  gfx  card for the A1200 that
connects  to  the  expansion  port  and  gives 800x600 resolutions in 24bit plus
Alpha,  1024x768 in 16 bit, or 1280x1024 in 8 bits (50-150 Hz vertically, 31-100
kHz  horizontally).  According  to  their  hand-out, it is fully compatible with
Picasso96, and several expansions to the AteoBus are also planned (multi-serial,
multi-parallel, SCSI, EIDE, ethernet, sound...).

Short  of  purchasing  a bus expansion, the Pixel64 is the only way to add a gfx
card  to an A1200 - at least until the BVisionPPC finally arrives -, without the
need for a PPC card.

Speaking  of  bus expansions, RBM was also present and showed their Towerhawk ex
for A1200/A4000, and their ONBoard1200, a Zorro-II expansion for the A1200. Most
impressively,  it  allowed  to  use  a  NewTek  Video  Toaster/Flyer on an A1200
motherboard.  For  those  who  look for a less "invasive" way of expanding their
A1200,  the  IOBlix1200  S/P  was  available, adding fast serial and/or parallel
ports  to  the  A1200  clock port. With the use of the clock port multiplexer, 3
such  cards could be used synchronously, with still more room for a soundcard or
a  Catweazel.  Funny  enough,  owners of A4000 systems asked about solutions for
<U>their</U>  boards,  and  sure enough, RBM offered a Zorro card that sported a
clock port... ;-)

But RBM was not the only one to offer serial / sound solutions. Kato Dev. showed
their  Melody1200  cards,  and the new Twister1200 add-on, a fast (460800 bit/s)
serial card that connects to the clock port, or to an already fitted Melody1200.
The  Melody1200  itself  was  available  in  its  "pro"  incarnation, with a DSP
allowing  for  MPEG2.5/Layer  3  playback  with  no  CPU  load (!). For the less
ambitious  user,  the "base" version came without the DSP, but still with 16bit,
44.1/48  kHz  sound  support.  All  Kato products were available at the Oberland
booth.

Two new, all-Amiga print magazines had their first issue sold at several booths:
Amiga  Fever  and  amigaOS.  While  amigaOS  concentrates  on  applications  and
"serious"  work,  Amiga  Fever  seems  to  cover  all aspects of our platform of
preference.  Both  are glossy, with Amiga Fever in full-color and amigaOS partly
b/w,  partly  color.  Both  magazines made a good first-glance impression on me,
with  interviews  with  W.  Dietrich  (phase  5)  and Fleecy Moss of Amiga Inc.,
dispelling  some dark rumors spreading recently. No, phase 5 is not in financial
trouble... ;-)

VillageTronic  offered the new Ariadne II, as well as their famous PicassoIV and
the  add-ons  Concierto,  Paloma  and Pablo. Moreover, they handed out a form to
gauge interest in a 8 MByte Voodoo-II add-on for the PicassoIV. If they get 500+
orders,  it  might  become  reality,  pushing  Amiga 3D perfomance to previously
unknown heights. Visit the VillageTronic website for more information!

After  resisting  the  lure of the "common expansion fever" for one hour or two,
greed  finally  took over and I did spend a small fortune on hard- and software.
After  that,  when  vision  became clear again ;-), the hall was rapidly getting
empty.  It  was  about  2:00 PM, and most booths had only a couple of interested
users left.

Sad  as it was, it left room for some interesting talks. Martin Berndt seemed to
be  positive that Bodyguard, although cancelled by Schatztruhe officially, might
appear  at  some  later  time.  At the Vesalia booth, there was some complaining
about dropping sales, the same at CoolBits and some other booths. However, while
being  sceptic and somewhat depressed, all of them shared the same credo: we did
not  come  to this point only to surrender now. Most distributors have a "second
leg"  in  the  PC world, since the Amiga market cannot feed many mouths anymore.
Those who do not, experience hard times indeed.

From  myself, therefore, the call upon arms once again: "Software worth using is
software  worth  buying. Support the distributors that support the Amiga. We are
one community, and we cannot survive without another!"

Petro,  however,  was still smiling like a cat that found the cream, but it took
some  more  hours to find out what was making him so happy. Meanwhile, we (I was
accompained  by  the  majority of our freshly founded user group) spend our time
watching  Annex'  dance performance and buing yet more equipment, which left our
backpacks very full and our purses quite empty.

Finally,  I forgot the time, and when one of my friends told me it was past 5:30
PM, I realised I missed the press conference. S**T!

However,  when  I  arrived  at the conference room, a guy dressed in a boingball
shirt calmly informed me that the conference was delayed "for hardware reasons".
Fact was, not a single piece of the hardware needed for the planned presentation
had  arrived  in  time  or  were  simply  missing.  So,  there would be only one
conference,  for both the press and the users, at 7:00 PM - which was then again
delayed...  Jeff  Schindler  opened  the doors and called the waiting people in,
excused  for  the  delays  and  handed  out coke and soda. While standing in the
crowd,  I  spotted  Aaron Digulla (AROS) and Urban Mueller (AmiNet), among other
VIPs that obviously did not feel too uncomfortable among 200+ users.

Finally,  the  conference  room was opened for all of us, where one third of the
people found a seat, two thirds a place to stand. Then, the conference started.

@node art02 "COMPUTER '98 : THE PRESS CONFERENCE"

COMPUTER '98 : THE PRESS CONFERENCE
-----------------------------------

The  press  conference dropped the bomb we all were eagerly waiting for - and it
was quite a surprise to all of us.

Petro  welcomed  both  press and users, and apologized for the delay. He told us
about  the  settlement  between  QuickPak and Mr. Hembach, which allowed for the
A4000T  to  be  assembled and sold again, and asked to place orders now. (Not at
the conference, of course, but at your local dealer. ;-) )

Bill McEwan then took over, and said that sadly his trusted A1200 was "too weak"
for  the  presentation  to  come,  and  that  he  was  sorry  he  had  to do the
presentation with PowerPoint - which earned him some "boooh"s, and some laughter
as his shoulders slumped and he walked away as if it broke his heart... ;-)

Bill  then  welcomed  Mike  Rees, Darrek Lisle and Alan Havemose, and passed the
word to Jeff Schindler.

Jeff  said  that  Petro  recieved an overwhelming response to his invitations to
this  conference:  "are  you sure you want to do this on Friday 13th?", which he
answered "yeah, sure". From the back rows someone shouted "make it a bad day for
Windows", which resulted in yet more laughter.

Jeff  stated  that only now, Amiga Inc. is where they intended to be back at the
WoA.  And  he  repeated his promise given at the St. Louis show, that Amiga Inc.
will  be  honest to the users, and tell only about what is real and done. "Great
things take time", he said to the audience. "We want the Amiga to be as great as
it was when it was first announced, nothing less" - those were his words.

Then, first mention was made that the OS kernel partner has been found, and that
later  on some presentation would be made that would show "things that you never
believed possible", a phrase that certainly earned some attention, and disbelief.

He  then presented some slides, which did say nothing breathtakingly new: the OS
3.5  upgrade to come, dedication to press and user groups. He mentioned that the
Amiga  users  share  a  special  bond no other platform has to offer, which made
several  people  nod  in  agreement,  including  myself  (I would not maintain a
time-consuming  service  like the News &amp; Stories for any other platform). He
told  us  of  the  possibility  to  ship a special "Developer OS 3.5", with some
special  power-user options, technical documentation and some "NG starter apps",
that should give a first idea of what the OS 5.0 would be like.

Then,  he  moved  on  to OS 5.0 subjects. He said that it was the focus of Amiga
Inc.  to  make  the  NG  architecture  "as ground breaking as when the Amiga was
originally introduced", and that the ultimate goal was to establish the Amiga as
"world  leading  standard  for  digital  convergence".  Again  he  reassured the
audience  that  desktop  computers are still a target market for Amiga, but only
one among many.

Then,  Alan Havemose took over, and shortly introduced himself. Stating the fact
he  actually  purchased  a  kickstart 1.2 upgrade, and had been in charge of the
AmigaOS  since  v2.1 certainly made some impression on those who did not already
know.

Alan then gave some insight on the specifications of OS5:
   * Build  on a state-of-the-art OS kernel, with the final AmigaOS kernel being
     even better than that;
   * with  a  high  performance  3D  engine  capable of calculating "hundreds of
     millions  tri-linear  mapped  3D  pixels  per  second",  enough  to  fill a
     1920x1200 24bit screen with fluent framerates;
   * high  performance  internet  solutions  - he  mentioned  ADSL, which ranges
     between  2  and 8 MBit/sec. and is currently established as future standard
     in both the US and Europe;
   * higher  resolutions  up  to  HDTV, 1920x1200, 24bit, with 1.2 GByte/sec. 3D
     output  (which, again, he compared to the 8 MByte/sec. of the ECS or the 28
     MByte/sec. of AGA chipset);
   * support  for new digital interfaces, like data communication by TV cable or
     satelite links;
   * support  for  industry  standard  APIs like OpenGL. "If there is a standard
     for it, of course we will support it."
   * running  on  almost every hardware/CPU there is, be it PPC (!), Intel (!?!)
     or RISC;
   * Amiga convergence APIs where no standards exists;
   * support for leading digital convergence processing hardware;
   * fully memory protected, preemptive multitasking, with processes and tasks;
   * efficient and compact (<4 MByte!);
   * fully 32bit, prepared for 64bit;
   * Multimedia / Gaming / Network centric.

The tension rised, because now Alan began to talk about
the OS kernel parter, and began to describe the partner OS as
   * audio/video/frame "hard" real-time OS with
   * virtual memory, being
   * ROMable, with support for
   * Multi-CPU systems, with support for
   * OpenGL and
   * Java build in, being
   * scaleable.

By  now,  most  people  were  on the edge of their seats.  Alan told us that the
company  he  was  talking about was founded 1981, therefor had 16 years business
experience,  with long-time Amiga connections, and being an established embedded
RTOS  leader. Business partners included Cisco, IBM, Phillips, Dupont, VISA, and
the NASA using the software on the Space Shuttle. Reportedly, 10 to 15 engineers
of the company used Amigas...

And the name is - QNX!

Here, my scribblings done during the presentation start to fail me, because what
was shown to us was really amazing. I did not understand the name of the man who
now  continued  the  presentation,  but from what I understood he was one of the
co-founders  of  the company.  He told us about his realtime OS company, and the
Neutrino  kernel  which will be used by future Amigas. He also told us about his
strong bonds to the Amiga, with his companion and himself owning Amiga #1 and #2
in Canada back when the A1000 was first presented. Over 70% of his employees own
and use Amigas.

He then continued that the Neutrino kernel is completely self hosted on PPC, x86
and  MIPS  CPUs,  less  than  50  KByte in size and completely up-/downscaleable
on-the-fly.  He  showed some graphics explaining the general architecture, which
is  build  around  a messenger microkernel, where process managers, filesystems,
TCP/IP  stacks,  GUI,  audio  and  character  I/O are all mere applications that
communicate  with each other by means of the microkernel. While this means a lot
of  communication,  we were told that Neutrino handles a complete context switch
in less than one microsecond, mere hundreds of nanoseconds.

"We  are  nothing proprietary, we use standard ELF binaries" - this sentence did
bring  back some bad memories about the powerUP / WarpUP disagreements. Full BSD
4.4  support  of  the  kernel,  an  almost 100% compatible POSIX enviroment that
allows  compiling the Apache web server without modifications, either full-blown
or  in  a  restricted  way  to  save  space,  128bit, IPV6 compatible, endianess
transparently  managed,  only 1 TCP/IP stack needed in a whole network, with all
connected systems using the same stack, scaleable fonts with anti-aliasing, full
unicode support with japanese / korean / chinese interfaces natively embedded, a
platform  independent GUI... my scribblings fail to list all the stunning things
we  were  told  and  shown. A browser was shown, showing the Amiga International
homepage, Yahoo Japan (in Kanjii!) and Amiga Inc. homepage (with full JavaScript
support)  in  three  separate windows.  A desktop including TCP/IP stack, dialer
and  JavaScript-enabled  browser  was booted from a 1.44 MByte floppy - although
Alan  saw  some  people  in the audience doing quick file size calculations, and
said that QNX has some competition in this field by the Amiga...

The  most  stunning thing, however, was Photon, the QNX GUI microkernel. Two PCs
were  connected together by a TCP/IP link, and an application opened on the left
machine  -  and  the  window  was  then  transfered  to  the right screen by two
mouseclicks.  Then,  the  two  systems  were  "joined", which means defined as a
single  desktop.  Dynamically,  the  task bar (Win95-like) expanded to the right
screen. A Doom demo was started, and the window dragged to the border of the two
screens,  so that the left part of the window was displayed on the left machine,
and  the right part of the window on the right screen. The audience was informed
that  this  was  possible for a virtual unlimited number of screens, distributed
all over the world by nothing more than a 28.8k modem.

There  was more shown and told, but I could not write the things down as fast as
they came, and as the Q&amp;A session started, I had to leave to catch my train.
I  heard  some  question  about  "why wait for an AmigaOS5, when we can have QNX
now?",  and  it  was  answered that QNX is a mere kernel/OS company, and all the
higher  APIs are left to Amiga Inc., and that the QNX kernel will change in look
and  feel until it becomes AmigaOS5. That was about the last thing said before I
had to take off.

Newsmaster's comment

We  were  taken  by  surprise. As the QNX logo first appeared on the screen, the
reaction  was  almost nil - the majority of the audience probably never heard of
QNX,  and  neither  did  I. What was shown afterwards, however, made some people
(including myself) nervous with excitement. This kernel has something definitely
Amiga-like to it.

Some  negative  reactions  were  heard  when PowerPoint was used for the initial
presentation.  The  Doom  trick failed once, and the second time window movement
was  slow  and  did hang for several seconds.  When the QNX guy rebooted the two
computers,  it  showed  that  they were PIIs (233 and 266 MHz respectively) from
Gateway. The reboot across the TCP/IP connection failed once.

But  those  were the "technical difficulties" that delayed the conference in the
first line, since, as we were told, the hardware intended to be used in the show
failed  to  appear in time. Intel CPUs do field some massive firepower, are very
well  supported by development tools and hardware manufacturers, and widely used
and  readily  available, so it comes quite naturally that an OS company like QNX
makes  use  of them. The fact that QNX also runs natively on PPCs and MIPS shows
that  QNX is no Intel breed, but truly cross-platform - "which gets ugly when it
comes to endianess", to cite from the presentation.

For  my  part,  the  show was an exciting one. The QNX people are very concerned
about   creating   and   maintaining  a  micro(scopic)kernel,  with  multi-user,
multi-CPU, multi-platform, networking capabilities, no buts. It is not very hard
to imagine the AmigaOS philosophy fitting perfectly onto the QNX kernel. We were
shown  efficiency,  productivity  and  scaleability.  That,  together  with  the
hardware  power  of  the  MMC, is a very good foundation for a high-performance,
low-resource platform like the Amiga was back in the 80ies.

By  the  way,  Alan  mentioned that "Silicon Valey moves very fast", and that by
now,  there are two more companies that will probably field something comparable
to  the  MMC  with  roughly  the same timetable. Even more, that AmigaOS will be
build  around  the  MMC,  but it will be able to be used on any comparable media
processor.  And  the  QNX  multi-CPU  capabilities  will allow for adding a wide
variety of CPUs to any MMC system, if you need the horsepower!

Seeing  that  QNX  runs  natively  on  PPCs,  there  might even be a chance that
AmigaOS5 might run on "Classic" PPC Amigas...

@node art03 "COLOGNE / SOBER ANALYSIS OF THE SOBER ANALYSIS BY MARTIN HEINE"

COLOGNE / SOBER ANALYSIS OF THE SOBER ANALYSIS BY @{I}MARTIN HEINE@{UI}
--------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I've been there - and I really don't regret it!!!

Since  still  nobody  else  did,  I'll  give  you  a  few  infos about the press
conference  -  but  there's  no warranty all I'll mention is correct, especially
because the conference was not held in my native language.

(Btw:  Since  I'll  have  to  write  this  quick,  the  result  will be horrible
German-English;  but  I  think  you'll understand it anyway and since there's no
other report yet in this NG this seems to be better than nothing.)

Already  just  from  having  met  the  people  of  @{B}AI@{UB}  and  the  one  of the two
@{B}QNX@{UB}-presidents who was there as well has reassured me. I'm quite certain we will
get what we want.

The  conference  was delayed. It was planned to make one exclusive first for the
press,  later the one for the public. But because of technical problems with the
demonstration - at least I suppose this was the reason - this delayed. Therefore
we were waiting before the room.

@{I}Bill@{UI}  came  out,  said that it would be delayed, thanked us for our interest and
patience  and  said in return to the delay he would let come some drinks for us:
@{I}"Is this okay?"@{UI} - Well, we didn't refused very much to accept this... =)

Some  time  later  he came again, said that it would delay a little bit more. He
told  us  that  it  was  originally  planned  to  have  that  separate exclusive
press-conference  first,  than  the  one for the public. So we sighed, expecting
that  we  would  have to wait even longer. But unexpectedly @{I}Bill@{UI} offered that we
could combine them, making just one conference for all, because of the delay. He
asked  us  just  to  leave  the first rows of seats in the room for the press. -
Well,  when  the  doors  finally  opened  some  minute  later,  and the crowd of
@{B}Amiga@{UB}-Fanatics  stormed  into  the room, the @{I}"let first the press into the room"@{UI}
was no longer valid... :)

At  the  conference were @{I}Jeff@{UI}, @{I}Allan@{UI}, @{I}Bill@{UI} and @{I}Darreck@{UI} of @{B}AI@{UB} and of course @{I}Petro@{UI}
of  @{B}AII@{UB}.  Additional  there  was  one  of  the two presidents of @{B}QNX@{UB}, but in the
beginning he was sitting in the auditorium.

In  the auditorium was also someone from the german TV-channel @{B}ZDF@{UB}. Therefore we
can  expect  that  the  big  news  of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}-@{B}QNX@{UB}-cooperation will be reported
correctly by them.

At  first  @{I}Petro@{UI} was speaking. The only new thing was that he confirmed that @{B}AII@{UB}
will  build  further  @{B}A4000T@{UB}  using the parts from @{B}Quikpak@{UB}, Mr. @{I}Hembach@{UI} gave his
okay.  @{I}Petro@{UI} said Mr. @{I}Hembach@{UI} would be a nice guy, but the auditorium made clear
it  thought different about him... :) The @{B}Amiga@{UB}-parts from @{B}Quikpak@{UB} are currently
shipping on the ocean, he told us.

Then @{I}Bill@{UI} spoke some introducing sentences and gave the word to @{I}Jeff@{UI}, than spoke
@{I}Allan@{UI}. Some details about @{B}OS3.5@{UB} and @{B}OS5@{UB} were told, but nothing really new.

And  then the big news - the OS-Kernel-partner is @{B}QNX@{UB}. A murmur went through the
auditorium,  many  were disappointed in the beginning, because they did not know
@{B}QNX@{UB}  and  had  expected  a  better  known  company like @{B}Be@{UB} or @{B}Sun@{UB}. But after the
demonstrations  they  were  certainly all as convinced as I that @{B}QNX@{UB} is the best
possible choice. Although it was already said in this NG that @{B}QNX@{UB} is the partner
and  that  their  homepage  is  @{B}www.qnx.com@{UB},  nobody  told you that they are big
Amigans!  Many  of  their  (IMHO  16)  developers  have  an @{B}Amiga@{UB}, and this even
includes  both presidents of @{B}QNX@{UB}. The president told that the first computers he
and  his  co-founder  bought  for the company (that was 1981) were @{B}PC@{UB}s - but the
first computers both they bought for private use at home were @{B}A1000@{UB}s!

He  told  us that he got due to the cooperation with @{B}AI@{UB} spots of coffee in their
office  -  because  when they told this to their employees and asked them who of
them  would  own  an  @{B}Amiga@{UB},  some  of  them  were  currently  standing  at  the
coffee-machine... =)

So you see we do not only have a very good Kernel-partner but even one who knows
the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  -  and  loves it and is therefore excited to cooperate with @{B}AI@{UB} for a
comeback  of  @{B}Amiga@{UB}. Corresponding were his words about @{B}Microsoft@{UB}... :) Again we
were told at the show that @{B}Amiga@{UB} will be as much ahead the competitors when it's
re-introduced as it was the first time.

@{B}QNX@{UB}  architecture  is  very  stable  (as it has to, being even used in the Space
Shuttle;  wouldn't  like to see @{B}Windows@{UB} installed there, if I were an astronaut)
and  very compact. Those who were already on their homepage may have found their
demo disk - surf the web not from HD but only from a small 1.44MB-disk. The disk
was demonstrated as well.

The new @{B}AmigaOS@{UB} microkernel will be @{B}QNX@{UB}' "@{B}Neutrino@{UB}". It is extremely modular, so
it  fits  the needs of @{B}AI@{UB}'s DC-plans: from settop-box to workstation you'll have
the  same  kernel  core  and  add  as much components as needed for the specific
device.  Something  new  in  computing  is  their  GUI "@{B}Photon@{UB}" - it's the first
microGUI. For details please look at their Homepage.

They  demonstrated  @{B}QNX@{UB} RTOS and the auditorium was impressed. Demonstrating the
abilities  of the GUI, he showed us a window not only as used from it's "front",
but  also from it's side - i.e. just a vertical line, because the window was 2D,
of course.

Then  he  demonstrated  how  a  programm running in a window on one computer was
retargeted  to another computer without any delay and easily back by clicking on
a button on the window-border for this purpose.

Also it was shown that the demo-programm was on both computers at the same time,
so  that  any  action  (for  example  mouse-movement  to  press a button in this
demo-program, a card-game) could be done from each computer.

Because  of the @{B}QNX@{UB}-architecture it is very easy to spread the tasks for example
of a Raytracer to many other computers to speed it up.

But most impressive was the following. He started @{B}Doom@{UB} in a window and moved the
window  around  while  @{B}Doom@{UB} was running without any impairments. No, this wasn't
what  I  meant to be impressive. Very impressive was what happened when he moved
the  @{B}Doom@{UB}-window to the right border of the screen: as much as it got beyond the
screenborder of the first computer, it appeared at the left border of the second
computer's screen! So he moved the window from the one computer's screen step by
step  on  the  other's one. Then he drew it back a bit, so that the left half of
the  still  running  @{B}Doom@{UB} was on the one computer's screen, the other one on the
other's.

After the conference we had half an hour to speak individually with @{I}Petro@{UI}, @{I}Jeff@{UI},
@{I}Allan@{UI} and the president of @{B}QNX@{B} (a very nice man, like the @{B}AI@{UB}-crew).

Regarding  the  Sober  Analysis-Thread  it  seems  I  were  wrong. I thought the
OS-partner  would  be  "BIG" in the meaning of well-known, rich and with certain
influence. (But the reality is much better in my opinion, too.) But now it seems
that the whole project is really something @{B}AI@{UB} has initiated, therefor I admit my
speculations  were  wrong.  Looking  at @{B}AI@{UB}, @{B}QNX@{UB} and - maybe - Transmeta, we have
three  small  companies  that fit very good together, being "BIG" in quality but
not in quantity and complementing each other.

I  did  not  ask  @{I}Jeff@{UI}  about  my former speculation regarding @{B}AI@{UB} may not be the
initiator of this project, because I talked to others before, and when I came to
@{I}Jeff@{UI} again the time was already more than over and he was already talking with a
woman  (I suppose it was his wife) about other stuff, the computers were already
removed  and  I  was  already  the  last user who was there, so I decided not to
disturb him. But looking at the facts as they are now, it's very likely this was
initiated  by  @{B}AI@{UB}, especially being aware that they were at first thinking about
another  OS-partner.  Obviously  they  heard  about  @{B}Transmeta@{UB}  (or  whoever the
@{B}MMC@{UB}-maker  is,  but  the details and the time of the patent (because it was said
they'll  tell  us  @{B}MMC@{UB}-maker's  name  around this time, i.e. in January) make it
somewhat  likely) due to their @{B}GW@{UB}-relationship and found later @{B}QNX@{UB}; as they told
due to the @{B}WOA@{UB}-announcement - maybe due to it the @{B}QNX@{UB}-Amigans heard about @{B}AI@{UB} and
their plans and contacted them then.

Instead  of  this  I  asked the @{B}QNX@{UB}-president about another topic - because they
licence  their  technology  to  many  third parties I wanted to know if it could
happen that they licence it to a competitor of @{B}AI@{UB} as well or if @{B}Amiga@{UB} would have
exclusive access to their technology.

But  now  I  notice that I didn't tell yet something about the very big question
that  rose  out  of their cooperation: Why did they cooperate with @{B}AI@{UB} instead of
doing  it all at their own since they already have a running RT-OS? What's their
benefit?  Well,  @{B}AI@{UB}'s work will mainly be to implement the APIs. As @{I}Jeff@{UI} told us
they'll  use  standard  APIs  like  OpenGL  where standards are and that they'll
implement  new  ones where necessary - there he sees a chance for @{B}AI@{UB} setting new
standards.  The @{B}QNX@{UB}-president told IMHO (I did not understand all, and the bit I
heard  had still to be translated) that the reason why they cooperate with @{B}AI@{UB} is
that  they  want  to concentrate on their kernel, while @{B}AI@{UB} has to make a full OS
out  of  it  for  the  DC-market. @{B}QNX@{UB} is small regarding employees but of a good
quality  because  they  focus on this core and care there about every detail, he
told us.

And  regarding  the  question  if  @{B}AI@{UB} has to fear competition licencing the same
technology the president told me that he could not tell me more about this topic
due  to contracts but he gave me the impression that this would not be their aim
-  their licenced partner for the market-segment of Digital Convergence is @{B}Amiga
Inc@{UB}.

All  in  all I have to say that I'm very satisfied with what I've heard and seen
at  Cologne and that I'm sure @{B}AI@{UB} do their work very well and therefore will have
a  certain  chance.  Anyway  I  doubt  very  much  that  it  will  be easy to be
successful,  because  since  the partner is no "BIG" company in the definition I
gave above it will be harder to get a foot into the markets. And, to add this, I
wouldn't  count  that much on @{B}GW@{UB}'s money regarding this. After the official part
of  the  conference  @{I}Jeff@{UI}  stressed again on the question about the relationship
@{B}GW@{UB}-@{B}AI@{UB}  that  @{B}GW@{UB}  keeps  @{B}AI@{UB} very separate; @{B}GW@{UB} does it's @{B}PC@{UB}-business, @{B}AI@{UB} does it's
@{B}Amiga@{UB}-business.

So far about my memories of the press conference. Hope I could tell some users a
little bit new.

@node art04 "OPEN LETTER FROM TEAM AMIGA ABOUT THE AMIGA INC'S RECENT MOVES"

OPEN LETTER FROM @{B}TEAM AMIGA@{UB} ABOUT THE @{B}AMIGA INC@{UB}'S RECENT MOVES
--------------------------------------------------------------

Fellow Amigans,

As  most  of  you  now  know,  @{I}Fleecy  Moss@{UI}  is  no longer with @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}. It is
important  as  users and developers that we closely examine the sudden demise of
@{I}Joe  Torre@{UI}  and  @{I}Fleecy  Moss@{UI}  from @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} and whether this does or does not
impact *our* goals. I invite everyone to debate this issue with an open mind.

There  may  well  be  concerns  here which do not bode well for the community at
large and in particular those of us who have stayed the course over the last few
years without any assistance from any outside sources.

There  is  only  a limited time that revenue and resources can be devoted to any
cause  without some interaction from those controlling the flow of that cause. I
am  not talking about interaction from a financial standpoint, but rather from a
technical  sharing  of knowledge and information. If the aim is to keep a finger
on  the  pulse  of the community, @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} will find it hard to do that without
interaction with the community at large.

We  are  at  an important juncture with the recent announcement of @{B}QNX@{UB} as the OS
partner.  What  we,  as  users and developers, do with the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Classic and the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  II  may or may not be important to @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} and thus @{B}QNX@{UB} (as a partner).
We must look at the @{B}OS3.5@{UB} development, @{B}PPC@{UB} development, and @{B}QNX@{UB} development from
the proper vantage point of what it will and will not do *FOR US*.

Let's  anyone  misunderstand my personal resolve or committment, @{B}Team AMIGA@{UB} will
not  only  stay  the  course but will make efforts to also involve others in the
@{B}Linux@{UB},  @{UB}Unix@{UB},  @{UB}Posix@{UB}  community in our efforts to attain open platforms and open
systems for the long term future.

I  invite  anyone  interested  in  our  cause to email with specifics as soon as
possible  so  that a concerted effort can be made to achieve our long term goals
of open systems for the community at large.

There  is  a  good  possibility  that  we  may have an important guest at an IRC
conference  this  Saturday.  I  am currently working on the actual timing of the
event. You will NOT want to miss this. More details when I can.

Sincerely,
