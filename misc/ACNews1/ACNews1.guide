@{FG Shine}Welcome to AmiChannel News@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 1 issue of @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}.

I must confess that this is the second time I write an editorial for a magazine.
The  first time was with the first issue of the e-magazine you are reading. That
editorial  was very easy to write because it was only the presentation. But now,
it  is different. A lot of things has happened in this month. Probably, you have
read  already  tons  of  articles  about the big news. Some positives, some very
negatives.  In  case you miss the whole story, don't worry. You will found it in
this issue. Anyway I highly recommend you to read the @{" report " Link woa39} by @{I}B. Hutchings @{UI}
(the best report  I read in years) and the @{" FAQ " Link woa40} which recently appeared in the
@{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} web site.

Some  friends  of  mine have asked me my opinion. It's not so easy. Of course, I
would  like  to  @{I}`see  the @{B}Amiga @{UB}blow the socks off everything else that is out @{UI}
@{I}there', @{UI} as  @{I}Carl  Sassenrath @{UI}exclaimed in a demonstration of the predecessor to
the   so called @{B}MMC@{UB}. But, @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} has made two big mistakes: the first one is
rel ated  with  the  way  of doing things, and the other one is related with the
support of current machines. 

The  press  release "Kick-off the future with @{B}Amiga@{UB}" is a perfect example of how
not  to write a press release. Instead of clarify things, it confused everybody.
Fortunately,  they  are solving this mistake releasing little notes explaining a
bit better what the future plans are.

As  you  probably know, the current machines will not be supported by the mother
company.  And  this is the key point, the mother of all the controversies. As at
the  moment  of  the  conference this point had not been solved, a lot of people
thought  that @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} was abandoning the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. And this is not the case. The
now  called  @{B}Amiga Classic@{UB} will be supported by @{B}Phase 5@{UB} and @{B}Haage & Partner@{UB}, two
german companies that finally solved their problems about the @{B}PowerPC@{UB} standard.

Sadly,  in  this  month  of  May,  we  have  seen how @{B}Oregon Research@{UB} was out of
business,  @{B}Deimos Desing@{UB} has abandoned the Amiga scene, and the @{B}Amiga Games@{UB} page
(kept by @{I}Eddie Ivanov @{UI}) has been closed.

Apart from the @{B}WOA@{UB} mess, you will find in this issue two articles which has been
written  by @{I}Miguel Ramos, @{UI}one of the most active person of the spanish scene. In
one  of  them, he explains the hard situation of the @{B}Amiga@{UB} in Spain. I asked him
to  write  this  article  because  it  seems  that  all  the @{B}Amiga@{UB} companies and
celebrities think that there is not market outside UK, Germany and USA. And this
is  unfair.  If  the  spanish @{B}Amiga@{UB} community had more support from outsied, the
number of spanish @{B}Amiga@{UB}s would be increased for sure.

Anyway,  to  show our support and entusiasm, we have a lot of surprises for you.
However,  I  have signed a NDA as many others ;-), so I can't tell you anything.
But, I can tell you that we have BIG news. So, stay tuned!

@node not6 "DEIMOS DESIGN CANCELS PPC SUPPORT"

@{FG Shine}DEIMOS DESIGN CANCELS PPC SUPPORT@{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/12@{FG Text}

@{I}Press Release@{UI}

@{B}Deimos  Design@{UB},  the team behind @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB} has decided to cancel any and all
@{B}PPC@{UB}  support  in  it's  forth  coming title, @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB}. This was not an easy
decision  to  reach,  however,  we  feel  this is the only ethical way for us to
continue development.

This  decision  came  as a result of many factors, and we would like to take the
rest  of  this  announcement  to  address these points. For the record, we fully
believe  that any hope the @{B}Amiga@{UB} platform has of a future is with open, industry
standard  hardware,  and  an  updated  @{B}OS@{UB}.  However, we do not believe that this
future lays with the @{B}PowerUp@{UB} boards.

@{I}Cost Of The @{B}PowerUp @{UB}Investment @{UI}

An  overwhelming factor is cost. The big-boxed @{B}PowerUp@{UB} boards (the @{B}CS-PPC@{UB} range,
with  a  50Mhz  @{B}060@{UB}, a 233Mhz @{B}604e@{UB}, and no RAM) costs just under $2000 CAD after
taxes.  No  other  solutions  exist.  For  that  price, one could buy a complete
@{B}Pentium  II@{UB}  system. For the few benefits you get, we cannot justify the cost to
ourselves (try as we might).

That  is an economic reality that a lot of people (including some of us) will no
longer  ignore. Hence, not all of us will be buying @{B}PowerUp@{UB} cards, now or in the
future.  Now,  if we will not purchase these cards, it is simply hypocritical of
us to ask fellow @{B}Amiga@{UB} users to do so. We will not do that.

@{I}Lifespan of the Hardware @{UI}

We  also  believe that the @{B}PowerUp@{UB} boards are a short term stepping stone / hold
over.  There  is  no  guarantee  that  a  future @{B}AmigaOS@{UB} will ever support these
boards,  and  therefore,  they  potentially  have  even less value. Until the OS
supports the HW, any and all future HW developments are one big bandage. It does
nothing to heal the sickness, it only prolongs the suffering.

@{I}Which System To Use? @{UI}

Our  first  priority upon obtaining the @{B}PowerUp@{UB} hardware was to evaluate each SW
system  for  ourselves,  by ourselves. We ignored the statements from both sides
(as  each  side  is  obviously  biased  towards  their  system)  and  decided to
investigate them independently.

Suffice  to  say, that from our own analysis we decided that @{B}WarpUp@{UB} was the best
solution for @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB}. It clearly won us over on many factors:

 * Documentation.
 * Installation and ease of use.
 * @{B}PPC@{UB} native graphics support (RTG Master).
 * Stable development system, which worked as documented.
 * Shared Libraries *now* - a large part of our shared code.

We  then  decided  that  since our game would be supporting @{B}PPC@{UB} hardware, @{B}Phase5@{UB}
would  understand  our  decision (even if they did not like it) as it would only
mean more sales for them.

We  could  not be further from the truth! Basically, we were expected to support
@{B}PowerUp@{UB},  no  matter  what  the cost. Our viewpoint was that our usage of @{B}WarpUp@{UB}
meant:

 * It was still support for their fledging hardware.
 * It would mean more sales for them (regardless of the software used).
 * Using @{B}PowerUp@{UB} would adversely impact our development schedule.
 * Using  @{B}PowerUp@{UB}  would  effect  the @{B}PPC@{UB} support of the title (as less code was
   appropriate for the @{B}PPC@{UB} side under @{B}PowerUp@{UB} (the graphics system being a major
   consideration for this game).
 * It would effect the overall quality of the title.

Despite  the  fact  that is was still support for their product, it was not good
enough. It was basically all or nothing.

We  then  decided  to  go  back and re-evaluate @{B}PowerUp@{UB}, with the potential side
effect of scraping several months of work. Needless to say, we were not pleased.

@{I}Ulterior Motives? @{UI}

As  @{B}Phase5@{UB}  are first and foremost an add-on hardware company, one has to wonder
why  they  are  so  forceful  about using only the @{B}PowerUp@{UB} system. After all, no
matter  what software is used, it is only more sales for them (they are the only
provider of @{B}Amiga PPC@{UB} hardware).

It  does not tax their support department, they have stated that @{B}WarpUp@{UB} is not a
supported  system  (obviously  this job falls to @{B}H&P@{UB}). It does not hamper future
developments,  @{B}WarpUp@{UB}  would  have to adapt to future hardware developments, not
the reverse. What then, is the problem?

In @{B}Deimos Designs@{UB} opinion, it comes down to the fact that @{B}Phase5@{UB}'s objectives do
not coincide with the @{B}Amiga@{UB}s future. @{B}Phase5@{UB} have publicly stated that @{B}PowerUp@{UB} is
a  migration  path  to  a "real @{B}PPC OS@{UB}", with the side effect of speeding up the
current host system (i.e. your @{B}Amiga@{UB}). This has been stated in public forums and
on  the @{B}Phase5@{UB} website (@{B}http://www.phase5.de@{UB}). It has also been stated that this
"real  @{B}PPC  OS@{UB}"  is  not the proposed @{B}Amiga OS 4.0@{UB}. This can only mean that this
"real @{B}PPC OS@{UB}" is the planned @{B}A\Box OS@{UB}, not a future revision of the @{B}Amiga OS@{UB}.

That  is  fair  enough  -  they  are  free to do whatever they please with their
company  and  products.  However,  @{B}Deimos  Design@{UB}  does  not consider such plans
helpful  to  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}s  future and therefore we will not support their efforts
with our software.

@{I}Why Not @{B}WarpUp @{UB}? @{UI}

At this point, you may ask @{I}"Well then why not use @{B}WarpUp @{UB}?" @{UI}That is a very valid
point,  and  one which we considered. @{B}Deimos Design@{UB} had planned to go ahead with
@{B}WarpUp@{UB} until recent activities came to light.

The  final  straw came when @{B}Phase5@{UB} elected to put the @{B}PowerUp@{UB} system software in
the  flash-ROM.  We simply disagree with the practice of starting *any* software
system from third party hardware.

The  purpose of an expansion card ROM is to configure the card for OS usage, not
to  start  up  a  dedicated OS extension. Despite asking @{B}Phase5@{UB} some valid, open
questions, they chose to simply ignore us, rather than provide a valid technical
justification.

You  might  now  say,  @{I}"Well  @{B}WarpUp @{UB} will  find  a way to disable the @{B}PowerUp @{UB}
software". @{UI} Very  true,  there will always be a way around the @{B}PowerUp@{UB} software,
eventually.  That  is the key word, @{I}"eventually" @{UI}. @{B}Phase5@{UB} are free to change the
manor  in  which  the  @{B}PowerUp@{UB}  SW  is started with each and every update of the
flash-ROM.  This  means that @{B}WarpUp@{UB} could conceivably be disabled for weeks at a
time,  with  each  and  every  flash-ROM  update.  While @{B}WarpUp@{UB} would eventually
circumvent  this,  it would have a very negative effect on any products based on
@{B}WarpUp@{UB}. In @{B}Deimos Design@{UB}'s opinion, this is the desired effect.

@{I}Effects On @{B}Maim & Mangle @{UB}and @{B}The World Foundry @{UB}@{UI}

The  main  concern  is  -  what  are  the effects on @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB} and @{B}The World
Foundry@{UB}?

The  first  concern  is  @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB}. Unfortunately, some of the features will
obviously  have  to  be  scaled  back,  or  be removed completely. As far as the
overall  impact  on  @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB}, this is still under evaluation. When we have
completed our evaluation, we will announce the results.

The  second  part is, how does this effect @{B}The World Foundry@{UB}? Unfortunately, TWF
is   also  drastically  affected.  @{B}The  World  Foundry@{UB} was  first  and  foremost
established  to  create  and promote utilisation of high end equipment by games.
Obviously,  @{B}Deimos  Designs@{UB}  decision  to  cancel  @{B}PPC@{UB} support has a fundamental
conflict with that goal.

Therefore,  @{B}Deimos  Design@{UB}  has  withdrawn  from  @{B}The  World  Foundry@{UB}, effective
immediately.  We  would  like  to  assure  everyone  that we still have a strong
relationship  with  our  former partners, however, we feel it would be unfair to
them to remain a part of @{B}TWF@{UB}.

To  remove  any  and  all  doubt, we would like to state (on behalf of @{B}TWF@{UB}) that
@{B}Explorer  2260 PPC@{UB} is still being actively developed. This announcement does not
effect  @{B}Explorer  2260@{UB},  or the remaining members of @{B}TWF@{UB}, only @{B}Deimos Design@{UB} and
@{B}M&M@{UB}.

@{I}Conclusion @{UI}

In  conclusion,  the @{B}Deimos Design@{UB} team has currently decided to revert to a @{B}68K@{UB}
only  development  plan.  We  will not support attempts to migrate the remaining
market  to  an  alternate platform. The market needs to unite instead of bicker,
now more than ever.

If the @{B}Amiga@{UB} ever sees a native @{B}PPC OS@{UB}, we will of course consider supporting it
with  @{B}PPC@{UB}  native games. However, at this point we will bow out of the @{B}Amiga PPC@{UB}
market.

We  realise  that  this will not be a popular decision, and that not many people
will agree with it. That is, of course, your right. No matter how unpopular this
will make us, we stand by our decision and will not support a company that tries
to  artificially  limit  the end users choices. It is your right to run whatever
software  you  want  on  hardware  you  have  purchased, not a privilege which a
company can revoke at will.

Any  questions  or  comments  should be directed to @{B}Deimos Design@{UB}, not @{B}The World
Foundry@{UB}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/12@{FG Text}

April 30, 1998

@{B}Legacy Maker, Inc.@{UB} of Chicago, IL is proud to announce the commercial release of
@{B}PanCanvas@{UB}, the Motion Control plugin for @{B}ImageFX 2.6@{UB} and above.

@{B}PanCanvas@{UB},   by  @{I}Ola  Olsson @{UI},  is  a  powerful  tool  to  turn @{B}ImageFX@{UB}  into  a
professional-quality motion control station. Put simply, motion control involves
"panning"  across  a  still  image  to  create  the  illusion of animation. This
technique  is  used  liberally  in  documentaries  and  news  profiles, to bring
photographs and documents to life on the screen.

Just  draw  a  frame  over where you want your animation to start, and where you
want your animation to end, and @{B}PanCanvas@{UB} will smoothly crop your original image
into  an  animated  sequence.  It's  even  easy for your virtual camera to zoom,
follow curves and ease in and out of stops.

@{B}PanCanvas@{UB}  outputs  a  sequence  of  frames  (@{B}IFF@{UB}  or @{B}JPEG@{UB}) which can be used to
generate  @{B}Flyer@{UB}  clips,  @{B}Amiga  ANIM@{UB}s, @{B}MPEG@{UB}s, and more. It's easy to incorporate
@{B}PanCanvas@{UB} into your video editing suite.

@{B}PanCanvas@{UB} includes @{B}PanPost@{UB}, a post-processing engine to enhance your output.

@{B}PanCanvas@{UB} is shipping now! To order direct from @{B}Legacy Maker@{UB}, call 773-465-5158.
Visa    and    Mastercard    accepted.   E-mail   inquiries   are   welcome   to

Not  a  day has gone by this year without someone telling me that a reference on
my technical pagesis broken. Unfortunately there just hasn't been enough time in
the day to get to the tech pages and scan them for faults until recently.

I  have  spent  the  last day updating the technical reference pages at @{B}National
Amiga@{UB}.  I  have  gone through each one individually and corrected all the broken
links and missing files.

If  there  is anything else that is missing, or broken, please email me directly
telling  me  where the broken link is and I will make an attempt to fix it right
away.

All       technical       pages       should       be       referenced      from
@{B}http://www.nationalamiga.com/technical.html@{UB}  and  NOT  directly  to their links.
These  links are still in a state of transistion and their filenames will change
from time to time.

If  anyone  has  any technical documents they would like to add to the reference
pages,  please  submit  them  to  me.  We  will  host them locally and make them
available to the online search engine, as well as credit you for the submission.

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/12@{FG Text}

@{B}MIAMI 3.0@{UB} is now available from Schatztruhe!

Suggested Retail Price DM 79.00

US$1.00 = DM 1,77 given today's exchange rates!

Ordering  information:  The most convenient method of placing an order is to use
our  electronic  order form located at @{B}http://www.schatztruhe.de/order.html@{UB}. You
can also send an E-Mail to @{I}stefano@schatztruhe.de @{UI}including your address and the
products you wish to order.

@{B}Miami  3.0@{UB}  is  a  TCP/IP  protocol stack to access the Internet by modem, cable
modem,  ISDN  modem,  or to access local networks by Ethernet/Arcnet. We deliver
@{B}Miami 3.0@{UB} on three floppy-discs together with the license-code.

@{B}Miami 3.0@{UB} features

 * Replaces   @{B}AmiTCP/IP@{UB}  (@{B}bsdsocket.library@{UB})  in  an  API-compatible  way,  i.e.
   standard  clients  and  servers  for  @{B}AmiTCP/IP@{UB} usually also work with @{B}Miami@{UB}.
   Clients  for  @{B}I-Net  225@{UB}  or @{B}AS-225@{UB} can also be used with @{B}Miami@{UB}, using the PD
   @{B}socket.library@{UB} emulation library from @{UB}Aminet@{UB}.
 * Contains  a  complete TCP/IP protocol stack for point-to-point connections to
   your  Internet  provider  allowing  you  to  access the Internet, and for LAN
   (Ethernet/Arcnet) access.
 * Is  based  on the latest BSD TCP/IP code (Net/3 as distributed in 4.4BSD/Lite
   version 2), augmented by @{B}FreeBSD 2.x@{UB} extensions.
 * Supports RFC-1323 extensions for higher performance TCP.
 * Is a "true" TCP/IP implementation, not a "hack" that requires a shell account
   with additional programs running at your Internet provider.
 * @{B}Miami@{UB}  does  support the TCP/IP emulators @{B}"Slirp"@{UB} (by @{I}Danny Gasparovski @{UI}) and
   TIA though, so @{B}Miami@{UB} can also be used together with shell accounts.
 * Supports  SLIP,  CSLIP  and  PPP  as  built-in protocols without the need for
   SANA-II  drivers. The PPP implementation is rather fast and comprehensive and
   supports, for example, PAP, CHAP, authentication protocol fallback for @{B}Win-NT@{UB}
   servers,  and  VJC  TCP  header  compression.  The  PPP  code is based on the
   thoroughly  tested  code of ppp.device, but all PPP parameters are configured
   automatically by @{B}Miami@{UB}.
 * Also  supports  most  SANA-II  device drivers (for Ethernet, Arcnet and other
   network hardware).
 * Has  an  integrated  graphical user interface (based on @{B}MUI 3.3@{UB}, copyright by
   @{I}Stefan  Stuntz, @{UI} or  @{B}GTLayout@{UB},  by @{I}Olaf Barthel @{UI}) for *all* configuration and
   runtime  parameters,  including  the  settings  for  TCP/IP, interfaces, PPP,
   protocols,  dialing,  inetd, user database etc. The user interface module can
   be unloaded at any time to save memory.
 * Does not require the installation or modification of any external text files,
   libraries,  devices, environment variables, tool types etc. The configuration
   is  done  completely through the graphical user interface, and all parameters
   are  stored  in  a  single @{B}IFF@{UB} settings file. Functions to import/export many
   settings  from/to  @{B}ASCII@{UB}  text  files  (as  used  e.g.  by  @{B}Unix@{UB}  hosts or by
   @{B}AmiTCP/IP@{UB}) are available, too.
 * Has  a  built-in script-driven dialer with support for multiple phone numbers
   and  optional interactive mode. In the demo version up to 3 phone numbers are
   supported. In the registered version there is no limit.
 * Supports auto-redialing on several phone numbers during dialing.
 * Supports static and dynamic IP addresses for SLIP, CSLIP and PPP.
 * Supports  DHCP  and  BootP, and has an automatic dial log analyzer to support
   dynamic IP addresses even with SLIP and CSLIP.
 * Supports teach-in dialing, i.e. in most cases you do not even have to write a
   dial  script,  but  only  need  to  connect to your provider once manually in
   interactive  mode,  and  @{B}Miami@{UB}  will  "learn"  how to automatically log in by
   itself the next time you want to connect, i.e. @{B}Miami@{UB} will generate a suitable
   dial script by itself.
 * Supports  Arcnet  according  to  the  old  (RFC 826/1051) standard as well as
   according  to  the  new (RFC 1201) standard, for compatibility with Linux and
   Win95/NT.
 * Has extensive security features, including ping flood protection, IP fragment
   protection,    configurable    SYN  flood  protection,  IP  address  spoofing
   protection,  protection  from  "land",  plus  additional  packet  filter  and
   monitoring functions.
 * Has  many  of  the  popular  demons  (TCP/UDP servers) already built in, e.g.
   inetd, identd and fingerd.
 * Has  a  configurable,  dynamic  hostname  cache  to  reduce the number of DNS
   lookups  and  thus  speed  up  TCP  connection  setup, in particular with WWW
   browsers.
 * Allows  you  to  reconnect after a reset (without dialing) even with Internet
   providers that usually do not support this.
 * Is  completely  localized. (English/German at this time. Many other languages
   are in preparation).
 * Supports several new @{B}MUI 3.x@{UB} features (such as "drag&drop", "bubble help" and
   "context  menus")  as  well  as extensive context-sensitive online help, when
   using the @{B}MUI@{UB} interface module.
 * Support PPP-Callback/Dialback in a way that is compatible to Win-NT.
 * Supports SOCKS V4/V5 proxy servers to bypass firewalls.
 * Implements SANA-II R3, for better throughput with new SANA-II devices.
 * Supports  multicasting  level-2 and multicast routing for MBone compatibility
   and support of live audio/video applications.
 * Supports  automatic  redial/reconnect  on  hangup  (works best with static IP
   addresses),  and  automatic  execution  of  @{B}ARexx@{UB} scripts when certain events
   occur (start, end, online, offline etc.).
 * Phone bill data can be exported to a text file.
 * Supports  T/TCP  (TCP for transaction) for faster web browsing; supports Path
   MTU discovery for better performance across Ethernet and BSD packet filter.
 * Has a built-in IP filter to restrict and monitor access to your machine.
 * Comes  with  @{B}MiamiRemind@{UB},  a tool that can automatically hang up the line for
   you  after  a  period  of  inactivity, to save on phone costs. @{B}MiamiRemind@{UB} is
   highly configurable.
 * Comes  with  an additional configuration utility @{B}MiamiInit@{UB} that allows you to
   get  connected  to the Internet without configuring @{B}Miami@{UB} first. All you need
   to  do is answer a few questions with information your Internet provider gave
   you. @{B}MiamiInit@{UB} then dials up your Internet connection, verifies your data and
   tries to find out all remaining configuration parameters by itself. @{B}MiamiInit@{UB}
   will  only  ask  additional  questions  if  it  was  unable to determine some
   required  parameters by itself. Extensive online help is available throughout
   this  process.  @{B}MiamiInit@{UB},  like  @{B}Miami@{UB},  is  completely  localized and has a
   graphical  user  interface using @{B}MUI 3.3@{UB} or @{B}GTLayout@{UB}. @{B}MiamiInit@{UB} also supports
   cable   modems,   ADSL,  local  Ethernet  networks,  Magplip  and  may  other
   configurations. @{B}MiamiInit@{UB} contains extensive database of modems, ISDN TAs and
   ISDN  boards  for  automatic  configuration  of  init  strings, ISDN protocol
   conversion etc.
 * Comes  with  a  large  set  of  Internet tools: @{B}MiamiFinger@{UB}, @{B}MiamiTraceRoute@{UB},
   @{B}Miami! Ping@{UB} and many others.

@{FG Shine}AMIGA COMMUNITY LIAISON GROUP SPONSORS MAILING LIST@{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/13@{FG Text}

@{B}The Amiga Community Liaison Group@{UB}

The  @{B}Amiga  Community Liaison Group@{UB} (@{B}ACLG@{UB}) is a group being formed by members of
the @{B}ICOA@{UB}, @{B}Team Amiga@{UB}, and the @{B}Jay Miner Society@{UB}, among others, to help them keep
in touch with each other and coordinate their activities where this makes sense.
Our  intention is to include representatives from @{B}Amiga@{UB} organisations all around
the world in this.

The  first  two  subjects  considered  by  the  @{B}ACLG@{UB}  have  been the need for an
independent  channel  for Amiga news, and the question of how to provide support
for the @{B}ICOA@{UB} @{I}User Representative @{UI}to be elected in June.

The  first  of these has been dealt with by the creation of the @{B}Amiga News Feed@{UB}.
This  is  a  system by which @{B}Amiga@{UB} news will be collected and forwarded to @{B}Amiga@{UB}
magazines,  news  sites  and  other  interested  parties. News items will not be
edited,  but  must be attributed and limited in length and format. @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} and
others have already arranged to send out their news via the @{B}Amiga News Feed@{UB}. The
@{B}News Feed@{UB} will take the form of a read-only mailing list.

The second question is under continued discussion. The purpose of having a @{I}User 
Rep @{UI} is  to keep developers in touch with the needs of ordinary users. Therefore
we  hope  that those user group members and magazine staff in daily contact with
people  who are doing useful things with @{B}Amiga@{UB} computers, but who aren't part of
the online community, will join these discussions within the @{B}ACLG@{UB}.

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

@{B}The  Amiga  Community Liaison Group@{UB} (@{B}ACLG@{UB}) made up of members of @{B}Team Amiga@{UB}, the
@{B}Jay  Miner  Society@{UB}, the @{B}User Group Network@{UB}, and the @{B}Industry Council Open Amiga@{UB}
proudly announces the formation of the @{B}Amiga News Feed@{UB}.

Our  goal  is  to provide the operation of a low noise level, timely system that
can feed news to not only the @{B}Amiga@{UB} and non-@{B}Amiga@{UB} press, but to individual users
and user groups as well.

@{I}OPERATION @{UI}

News  post  summaries, including source, email and/or URL's are sent to a single
email  address.  Spam  and  rumors  are  removed  by  a moderator, the posts are
authenticated,  and  then  pushed  thru  the  news  feed. There is NO censorship
applied.

@{I}SUBSCRIBING @{UI}

 *  Send email to @{I}majordomo@ninemoons.com @{UI}
 *  Type @{I}subscribe tamiga @{UI}in the body of the email.

The  @{B}ANF@{UB}  is  a FREE service provided to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community with a single click
user  interface  for the posting of @{B}Amiga News@{UB}! We do ask that you visit the @{B}ANF@{UB}
webpage  and  place  the @{B}ANF@{UB} button in a prominent place on your website so that
all @{B}Amiga@{UB} users everywhere may take advantage of the service.

The  following  sponsors  are making the @{B}Amiga News Feed@{UB} avalable to you. Please

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/14@{FG Text}

It  has  been reported that the British trade paper, @{B}Computer Trade Weekly@{UB} ran a
small  news  item  about  the  @{UB}World  of Amiga@{UB} Show to be held this weekend near
London in its May 11th issue. In the piece, they stated that @{B}Gateway@{UB} will give a
real  boost  to  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB} community by announcing major new investments in the
platform.  They  went  on  to write that a possible new, high-end @{B}Amiga@{UB} would be
announced  with both @{B}Amiga@{UB} and @{B}PC@{UB} compatibility with a price target of £500-£700
($800-$1150 US).  The story noted that the new machine could be available within
18 months.

This   new  machine  would  feature  open  architecture  to  encourage  software
developers  and a radically improved operating system, according to the journal.
A  mock-up  unit  may  be  demonstrated at the show while a full working version
would  be ready in time for the Cologne @{B}Amiga@{UB} show in September according to the
report.

The  story  has  not  been  publically  verified by @{B}Gateway@{UB} or @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} and no
official sources were quoted in the article.

@{FG Shine}OPERA SOFTWARE ANNOUNCES DEVELOPMENT OF AN AMIGA VERSION@{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/15@{FG Text}

@{I}13 May 1998 @{UI}

Following the tremendous reponse to its @{B}Project Magic@{UB} initiative, @{B}Opera Software
AS@{UB}  today  announced  the  development  of  an  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  version  of  its  popular
browser.  The  development  will  be  carried  out by Reading, UK, based company
@{B}Ramjam Consultants Lt@{UB}, under the leadership of @{I}Tim Corringham. @{UI}

@{I}"We  are  delighted  to  be involved in porting @{B}Opera @{UB}to the @{B}Amiga. @{UB}@{B}Opera @{UB}has an
@{B}Amiga @{UB} 'feel'  to  it  even  under  @{B}Windows  95, @{UB}so I'm confident it will make a
high-quality  @{B}Amiga @{UB} application,  and  will  offer a degree of commonality with
@{B}Windows 95 @{UB}that few applications achieve", @{UI}says @{I}Corringham. @{I}

@{I}"Being  a  long-time  @{B}Amiga @{UB} user  myself, it provides me with great pleasure to
announce  the  official  development  of  @{B}Opera @{UB} for  the  @{B}Amiga @{UB}platform", @{UI}adds
Business  Director  for  @{B}Opera  Software@{UB},  @{I}Jon von Tetzchner. @{UI}@{I}"It was one of our
goals  to  make @{B}Opera @{UB}available to as many Internet users as possible, and being
able  to  offer  an  @{B}Amiga @{UB} version  not  only  adds  credibility to @{B}Opera @{UB}as an
efficient  and  user-friendly  application,  but also constitutes a boost to the
@{B}Amiga @{UB}platform." @{UI}

@{I}"This  step  is  just  the  logical  result  of  @{B}Project  Magic, @{UB}which since its
inception  has seen several thousands of users pledging their support for @{B}Opera @{UB}
for  platforms  other  than @{B}MS Windows. @{UB}The @{B}Amiga @{UB}community has come out in full
force,  and we are proud to be able to soon offer a product that is as advanced,
efficient  and  frugal  as  the  Operating  System  it runs on", @{UI}explains @{I}Helmar
Rudolph, @{UI}initiator and manager of @{B}Project Magic@{UB} for @{B}Opera Software@{UB}.

Both  companies  aim  at  a  release  date  of December 98, just in time for the
Christmas  shopping  season, providing a source of fun and satisfaction for many
loyal and die-hard @{B}Amiga@{UB} followers.

Opera  for  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB} is expected to support the same level on functionality as
its  @{B}Windows@{UB}  counterpart,  thus  putting it at the forefront of browsers on the
@{B}Amiga@{UB} platform.

The  price for this version is not yet established, but it is planned to keep it
in line with the @{B}Windows@{UB} version.

@{FG Shine}AMIGASOC ANNOUNCES AMIGA CLIENT AVAILABLE FOR FOOTBALL 365@{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/19@{FG Text}

@{B}Football 365@{UB} is coming home... to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}!

Leading  Internet  technology  company,  @{B}IMM  Studios@{UB} in partnership with @{B}Direct
Network  Publishing@{UB}  have  recently developed a unique and innovative publishing
system  which  forms  the  heart  of a new daily free Internet football magazine
named @{B}"Football 365"@{UB}. As well as providing the most up-to-date news available in
the  footy  world,  it  can  even  be  personalised to your own team preferences
through  the  @{B}"Homeground"@{UB}  section.  It's  big.  So  big in fact that they have
leading  football  journalists  such as @{B}"Under the Moon"@{UB} host @{I}Danny Kelly @{UI}on the
team.  @{B}F365@{UB}  is  available  on the web, but is also designed to be delivered via
E-Mail.

@{B}IMM@{UB}  has  developed software to automatically unwrap the E-Mail and view it in a
web  browser  for  @{B}PC@{UB}s,  but  now @{B}AmigaSoc UK@{UB} have once again demonstrated their
"actions  not  words"  policy  with the release of the official @{B}Amiga@{UB} viewer for
@{B}Football  365@{UB}. Although we have developed the @{B}Amiga@{UB} version without payment from
@{B}Football  365@{UB},  in  return  we  ask that you support the developers of @{B}Amiga@{UB} web
browsers by buying/registering your favourite browser to ensure that development
of that product continues.

So check out the @{B}Football 365@{UB} web site today at @{B}http://www.football365.co.uk@{UB}, or
even  sign  up right now at this address: @{B}www.football365.co.uk/register.imm@{UB}. If
you're already subscribed to @{B}Football 365@{UB} and have specified your computer to be
something  other  than  an  @{B}Amiga@{UB}, then we strongly encourage you to update your
records  by  entering  the  registration  page and changing your machine type to
"@{B}Amiga@{UB}".  This  way  we can prove that there's a substantial market, and we have
been  given  a  target  of  approximately 1000 people. It is our aim to make the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  at least the second most popular platform represented on @{B}Football 365@{UB}. Go
on, what have you got to lose? It's free after all!

Apart  from organising all the seminars and the IRC links (which @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} have
kindly  agreed to sponsor), @{B}AmigaSoc@{UB} will be bringing leaflets and various other
literature about @{B}Football 365@{UB} to the @{B}World of Amiga@{UB} show this weekend, so if you
don't  get  the  chance to visit the website before then, pick up something from
there while you watch the football!

@{FG Shine}OFFICIAL FOUNDATION MAILING LIST NOW OPEN@{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/19@{FG Text}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

The  official  @{B}Foundation@{UB} mailinglist is now open. For all those who don't know,
I've  been working closely with @{I}Paul @{UI}for just over 6 months on this project, and
now  the  game  has begun to go on sale (First copies are to be sold at the @{B}WOA@{UB},
where  @{I}Paul @{UI}will be attending on the @{B}Sadeness@{UB} stand) it now seems appropriate to
go public with the email address.

The  software  used  to  run  the  mailinglist  is my own, and will be available
directly from @{B}F1 Software@{UB} in the next 2 months or so.

There are 2 sides of the mailinglist, a digest side, and a regular posting side.
If  you  subscribe  to  the Digest part of the list, you can still make postings
etc.  and  will  receive  one  large  email  a  day, with all the previous day's
postings  compiled  into  an easy-to-read list for your convinience. If you join
the  regular  list,  then you will simply receive lot's of seperate mails. It is
possible to join both of the lists if you wish.

To join the mailinglist, simply send a blank email with the subject as SUBSCRIBE
DIGEST  (if you want to join as a Digest member) or SUBSCRIBE  (on it's own will
place  you  on the regular list) to @{I}mushypd-foundation@redrose.net @{UI}where it will
be  processed  automatically.  Please  allow  for  time  to  process your mails,
especially  if  the list is experiencing a lot of traffic. Digest's are compiled
at  Midnight  EST  time,  and  can  take  as much as 2 hours to distribute it to
everyone. Please be patient.

I  would  also  like  to ask people not to make any kind of postings to the list
until  they  have  received confirmation that they have been joined to the list.
The  list  is moderated by myself to ensure nothing spam-wise get's through, and
when  a  SUBSCRIBE/SUBSCRIBE  DIGEST command comes in, an authentication process
must  occur before you will be added. If you try and post before you receive the
final  conformation,  there is a good chance your mail will not make it onto the
list.

For  those who are interested in seeing what the list is all about, you can send
a  mail  to  the  same  address  with the subject as FAQ and information will be
mailed  to  you,  without placing you on the mailinglist. Note, that the FAQ and
INFO files will be majorly updated as soon as @{I}Paul @{UI}returns from @{B}WOA@{UB}. Which takes
us onto the next part of the message.

@{I}Paul  Burkey @{UI} is  on  the  mailinglist, so please don't heckle him with lot's of
stupid  questions  that  are  already  answered  in  the FAQ files. @{I}Paul @{UI}already
receives  lot's  of  mail  about @{B}Foundation@{UB}, so please give him time to read and
reply to mails.

Thank-you  for  your  time  and  patience.  Enjoy  the  game,  and now enjoy the
mailinglist!

Organization: @{B}Oregon Research@{UB}
Newsgroups: comp.sys.amiga.misc
Subject: @{B}Oregon Research@{UB} Going Out of Business (long)
Date: Mon, 18 May 1998 21:32:32 GMT

@{B}Oregon Research@{UB} Going Out Of Business Sale Now until June 30, 1998

A sad sad day...

This last year has been difficult for all @{B}Amiga@{UB} users and even more so for us at
@{B}Oregon  Research@{UB}.  This  is  a sad day in the world of @{B}Amiga@{UB}. After ten years of
service,  it  is with great sadness that I must announce that @{B}Oregon Research@{UB} is
going out of business.

The expenses of operation have far exceeded business income for too long and our
creditors  have  lost  their patience. Even though @{I}Jo @{UI}and @{I}I @{UI}have both taken jobs
outside of the business to help repay the debts, it is not enough.

In  an  effort to repay our business debts and avoid personal financial ruin, we
are  forced to liquidate all of our inventory and business assets. We have tried
to  avoid  this action for as long as possible. Unfortunately, time and the bill
collector caught up with us before @{B}Gateway@{UB} could deliver on their promises.

I  want  to  take this opportunity to personally thank each and every one of you
for  supporting  us  over the years. Without your loyal support, @{B}Oregon Research@{UB}
would never have been possible and my personal dream of building my own business
would  never have become a reality. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
My  only  regret  is  no longer having the opportunity to serve such a wonderful
subset of the human race.

Until we meet again.....

@{FG Shine}PHASE 5 AND HAAGE & PARTNER ANNOUNCE COOPERATIVE EFFORT@{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/21@{FG Text}

May  18,  1998:  In  a joint anouncement after the recent @{B}World of Amiga@{UB} show in
London,  and  as a reaction to the plans revealed by @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB}, @{B}Haage & Partner@{UB}
and  @{B}Phase  5  Digital Products@{UB} have emphasized their full and continued support
for  the  @{B}PowerPC@{UB}  integration.  With  joint  efforts  both vendors will further
support  the  developers  and the users of @{B}PowerPC@{UB} technology, and will ensure a
fast  growing  number of stunning and powerful applications. With many thousands
of  @{B}PowerUP@{UB} boards beeing shipped so far, a number of installed systems which is
rapidly growing, the @{B}PowerUP@{UB} boards already provide an attractive market for all
developers.  This fact is underscored by many upcoming @{B}PowerUP@{UB} releases of major
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  software  packages,  and the increasing support of software vendors which
has been agreed on during the @{B}WoA@{UB} even after the announcements of @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB}

@{B}Haage  & Partner@{UB} and @{B}Phase 5 Digital Products@{UB} emphasized that the competition of
their  different  approaches  towards @{B}PowerPC@{UB} integration, as well as the public
dispute  about  this,  are  a matter of the past. @{I}"We will ensure that users of 
@{B}PowerUP @{UB} system  have  a transparent integration of their @{B}PowerPC @{UB}software, and 
will  see  a rich variety of most powerful applications to be released soon" @{UI}say
representatives  of  both  companies.  Further  development  of  @{B}PowerPC@{UB}  system
software  shall  be  done with close consultations between the companies; beside
that, cooperations in the development of powerful @{B}PowerPC@{UB}-based system libraries
and other OS extensions are being discussed.

In  meetings  of the managements of @{B}Haage & Partner@{UB} and @{B}Phase 5 Digital Products@{UB}
with @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} already during the @{B}WoA@{UB} show in London, it has been agreed that a
new  proposal  will  be  presented  to  @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} which outlines an alternative
option to @{B}"Amiga Bridge"@{UB} system planned by @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB}

This  alternative  is a new @{B}PowerPC@{UB}-based system, which will feature the planned
@{B}Amiga  OS@{UB}  upgrade  and can be out for sale in the retail channels by end of the
year  already. Beyond incorporating standard industry components and interfaces,
such   a  system  can  provide  additional  options  which  allow  for  creative
development  and  expansion  in  the  spirit  of  the @{B}Amiga@{UB} and can also run the
current and next releases of @{B}AmigaOS@{UB}.

Based  on  the  @{B}PowerPC@{UB}, this system will also provide continuity and innovation
for all users and developers, and will allow the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community to take part of
such  stunning  developments  such  as  @{B}Motorola@{UB}'s  new  @{B}AltiVec@{UB}  technology, an
extension  to  the  @{B}G4  PowerPC@{UB}  processors  which  will  provide a breathtaking
performance  already  early  next year. With approval and support of @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB},
this  technology  can  introduce  the long-awaited revival of the @{B}Amiga@{UB} platform
already  this year, quickly providing a growing market of powerful systems which
users  can  buy,  and  for  which  developers  can develop and sell software and
add-ons.

@{B}Haage & Partner@{UB} and @{B}Phase 5 Digital Products@{UB} also encourage all @{B}Amiga@{UB} developers
who  want  to  participate today in an existing innovation, and who want to be a
part  of  an  @{B}Amiga@{UB} market which provides growth, continuity and innovation from
now  on  and  during  the  next years, to speak out now and commit themselves to
support the @{B}PowerPC@{UB} as the heart of the next generation of @{B}Amiga@{UB} systems.

@{FG Shine}FIRST REPORT FROM WOA PRESS CONFERENCE@{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/22@{FG Text}

Subject: Overview of the @{B}WOA@{UB} press conference
Date: Sat, 16 May 1998 00:18:04 +0100
From: @{I}Fabrice COLIN @{UB}(@{I}F.P.J.P.Colin@herts.ac.uk @{UI})
Organization: EUDIL 98, GTR 95
Newsgroups: comp.sys.amiga.misc

Hi there,

Here  I  am,  back  from  the  press  conference  given  by  @{B}AInc@{UB}  at Novotel in
Hammersmith.  I won't give too many details as I would like to go to bed :-) but
rather give an overview of @{B}AInc@{UB} annoucement. Well I'm quite excited ...

The  @{B}Amiga@{UB} as it is known now (@{B}OS 3.1@{UB}, @{B}AA@{UB} and @{B}68k@{UB}) is declared legacy, or @{B}"Amiga
Classic"@{UB} in @{B}AInc@{UB} terms.

An  efficient  development  platform  is  required  to  incorporate  all the new
technologies   we   have   missed  during  these  years.  It  should  bring  the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  technologies to a wider audience as well as give a base for @{B}AOS 4.0@{UB} which
will  support memory protection, @{B}SMP@{UB}... on one hand and @{B}PCI@{UB}, @{B}AGP@{UB}, @{B}DVD@{UB} ... on the
other hand.

The  sad  thing  is that this @{B}"Amiga Bridge"@{UB} will be @{B}x86@{UB} based. No mention about
@{B}PPC@{UB},  at  least  nothing  really  clear  even when @{I}W.Dietrich, @{UI}who seemed to get
nervous,   asked   if   @{B}AInc@{UB}   intended  to  kill  the  hardware  manufacturers.
Nevertheless, this bridge is destined to be transitional only. As @{B}AInc@{UB} will stay
a  software  development  firm only, other designs will be welcomed. As far as I
have  understood,  it  should not be a big problem since @{B}"Amiga Classic"@{UB} will be
supported  through the @{B}Siamese@{UB} system. The thing is: will @{B}AInc@{UB} back up those who
want to do a @{B}PPC@{UB} port ? It seems so!

@{B}AOS 4.0@{UB}, due for Nov 98 (yes) will be developed on top of a 3rd party kernel. We
don't know anything yet, apart from the fact that @{B}AInc@{UB} is currently in dicussion
with several other firms such as @{B}Be@{UB} ...

@{B}AOS  5.0@{UB}  (end  of 99), aimed at the @{B}"Digital Convergence"@{UB} platform (still to be
defined/unveiled)  will  be  aimed  at customers, although @{B}AOS 4.0@{UB} would also be
usable for an end user. @{B}3.5@{UB} is cancelled so the average user will wait 18 months
for a revision of the OS. @{B}"Classic"@{UB} and @{B}"Bridge"@{UB} compatibilities will be assured
via emulation.

@{I}Jim Collas, @{UI}Senior Vice President of @{B}Gateway@{UB}, who has been put under pressure by
3  MIB  (who are they ? I don't know) and a bloke from @{B}Alive Mediasoft@{UB}, promised
to  clarify  the  situation  regarding the @{B}PPC@{UB} tomorrow. That's it. More to come
tomorrow I hope ....

PS: This post has been written in the train while I should have been sleeping. I
must also say that I have eaten too much at the buffet 8>) --

@{FG Shine}GREAT EFFECTS DEVELOPMENT IS DEVELOPING A NEW AMI-FILESAFE@{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/28@{FG Text}

From: @{I}Michiel Pelt,@{UI} @{B}Great Effects Development@{UB}

@{B}Great    Effects  Development@{UB}  proudly  presents  the  new  @{B}Ami-FileSafe@{UB}  called
@{B}PROFESSIONAL FILESYSTEM 2@{UB}!

The  author  of  @{B}Ami-FileSafe@{UB},  @{I}Michiel  Pelt, @{UI} has  reclaimed copyright and has
continued  development.  The  product  is now in the hands of our company, @{B}Great
Effects Development@{UB}. The product will soon be released under the name of @{B}PFS2@{UB} in
June 1998.

@{I}Improvements over @{B}Ami-FileSafe @{UB}@{UI}

 * special price for registered @{UB}AFS@{UB} users.
 * @{B}68000@{UB}, @{B}68020@{UB}, @{B}68040@{UB} and @{B}68060@{UB} versions.
 * Build-in  interface  for  live optimiser. There is no optimiser yet, but this
   interface  makes it possible to optimise the disk without taking it off-line.
   When  the disk is accessed during optimisation, @{B}PFS2@{UB} will stop the optimiser,
   which  can continue afterwards. A dormant optimiser can even be automatically
   notified when the system is idle, making optimisation completely transparent.
 * improved  testing  procedures  making @{B}PFS2@{UB} more stable and reliable then ever
   before.
 * enhanced documentation including programming docs (disk structure and special
   packets).
 * new versions of all supplied tools, pfsls, diskvalid etc.
 * full support plus disk repair service.
 * fully @{B}Ami-FileSafe@{UB} compatible.
 * early  problem  detection  mechanism.  The  early problem detection mechanism
   detects  problems  with  your  disk  before  it is too late, ensuring optimal
   protection of your data.
 * extended disk structure to make disk-repair easier
 * Comes on CD.

@{I}Plus all that @{B}Ami-FileSafe @{UB}already had @{UI}

 * superior performance. Up-to 500% improvement over @{B}FFS@{UB}
 * disk are always valid. No more 'validating disk'!
 * reliability
 * concurrent   access  without  performance  loss.  @{B}PFS2@{UB}  handles  simultaneous
   accesses very well!
 * easy  file-recovery  with  the  delete directory. Getting a deleted file back
   never was so easy
 * automatically truncated logfiles. Get rid of those ever growing logfiles

Order quickly and receive a special bonus: our fabulous and praised game @{B}Kang-Fu@{UB}
free of charge!

@{B}PFS2@{UB}  will  be  available  at  the  end  of June, 1998. Check out our website at
@{B}http://www.greed.nl@{UB} for details or mail us at @{I}info@greed.nl @{UI}

@{FG Shine}FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT ANNOUNCEMENT AT WORLD OF AMIGA@{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/31@{FG Text}

This news release is from the @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} site at @{B}http://www.amiga.com/@{UB}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

 * @{I}Are you abandoning the @{B}Amiga @{UB}? @{UI}

No,  we  are  focusing  our  efforts  on  the development of the next generation
architecture  and  operating system. We are working with third parties to create
an open architecture necessary to bring the @{B}Amiga@{UB} back for the future.

 * @{I}Isn't the new @{B}Amiga @{UB}really just a @{B}PC @{UB}with @{B}Amiga @{UB}slapped into it? @{UI}

While it is true that the next generation of @{B}Amiga@{UB} will use the @{B}x.86@{UB} platform as
a  development system, this is meant to be used as a bridge to take the @{B}Amiga@{UB} to
version  5.0.  @{B}Amiga  5.0@{UB}  is a brand new @{B}Amiga@{UB}, using the most evolutionary and
revolutionary technology of software and hardware architectures.

 * @{I}Why didn't you choose @{B}PowerPC @{UB}for the next generation @{B}Amiga @{UB}platform? @{UI}

The  @{B}Motorola@{UB}  roadmap  does  not  match  our vision for the future that we have
targeted  for  the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. The @{B}Amiga Classic@{UB} line will continue to support @{B}PPC@{UB} as
an accelerator the current systems.

 * @{I}So do I just throw away all of my @{B}Amiga @{UB}applications and start over? @{UI}

No.  The  @{B}Amiga  4.0@{UB}  will  support  most  of your existing applications through
software  emulation.  We are working with another third party hardware vendor to
develop  a hardware add-on (@{B}Amiga Classic Card@{UB}) that will make the bridge system
backwards compatible.

 * @{I}Are you really abandoning the @{B}Amiga OS @{UB}and licensing another OS? @{UI}

We  are  NOT  abandoning  the  @{B}Amiga  OS@{UB}.  We  are  investigating  the option of
leveraging  a  state  of  the  art kernel of another OS to speed the development
process and decrease our time to market the next generations of the @{B}Amiga OS@{UB}.

 * @{I}Summary @{UI}

We  are  focusing  our energy on bringing the @{B}Amiga@{UB} technology and the community
into  the  21st  century,  ahead  of the pack. We will target our efforts on the
operating  system and an open architecture necessary to truly be a leader in the
multimedia, digital convergence marketplace.

@{FG Shine}THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS BY BEN HUTCHINGS@{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/19@{FG Text}

From: @{I}Ben Hutchings <worc0223@sable.ox.ac.uk> @{UI}
Newsgroups: comp.sys.amiga.misc
Subject: The big announcements
Followup-To: poster
Date: 18 May 1998 21:45:08 +0100
Organization: Oxford University
Sender: @{I}womble@eldritch.dyn.ml.org @{UI}

Here's  my  (rather hurried) report on Friday's announcements. It's based on the
notes  I  made  at  the  time,  plus  additional details I remembered, plus some
clarifications  I got later from @{I}Fleecy Moss @{UI}and @{I}Joe Torre. @{UI}It could probably be
improved quite a bit, but I haven't got time to do that right now.

If  you  need to reply to me, please use e-mail, as I am unsubscribing from this
group until my final university exams are over (late June).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The  presentation  took  place in a large hall on the first and second floors of
Novotel. @{I}Petro Tyschtschenko @{UI}was first to speak; he began by presenting gifts to
the  @{B}World  of  Amiga@{UB}  organisers  (@{I}Peter  Brameld @{UI} and @{I}Norah Hodgson @{UI}). Then he
summarised  what @{B}Amiga International@{UB} had been doing in the past year, mentioning
shows,  the  website,  new  licenses,  the success of @{B}Amigas@{UB} in the Indian video
market, and continuing sales of @{B}Amigas@{UB} for kiosk systems.

@{I}Jeff Schindler @{UI}then stepped up to make the announcements we were all waiting for
(well, except those journalists who had been to the lunchtime event). He thanked
@{I}Petro, @{UI} and  then  introduced  the  @{B}Amiga  Inc@{UB} employees present. @{I}Marilyn Flint @{UI}
(Manager), @{I}Joe Torre @{UI}(Hardware Engineer), and @{I}Darreck Lisle @{UI}(Events Coordinator)
were  all  there.  @{B}Gateway@{UB} was represented by @{I}Jim Collas, @{UI}Senior Vice President,
and  @{I}Steve  Johns, @{UI} Head of Corporate Development. @{I}Jeff @{UI}then announced three new
employees - @{I}Fleecy Moss @{UI}(Project Manager), @{I}Dr Allan Havemose @{UI}(Head of Technology
and Development), and @{I}Bill McEwen @{UI}(PR).

The  business plan that has now been approved for funding by @{B}Gateway@{UB} is the 15th
in  a  series  of  refinements  by  @{I}Jeff. @{UI} Unfortunately  not all of it could be
revealed  as some details (about a third of the information that was intended to
be announced) have yet to be agreed with outside companies. The rest is expected
to be finalised within about a month.

@{I}Jeff  Schindler @{UI} showed a series of slides (using @{B}Powerpoint@{UB}, sadly) summarising
his  points.  I noted down much of the content of these so I could remember what
was  said.  The  key  question  for @{B}Amiga@{UB} is, how can it regain a lead? The next
question  that  can be asked is, what defines an @{B}Amiga@{UB}? @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} decided it was
not  specific  technologies,  but  the  vision:  awesome  technology, freedom of
choice,  an enthusiast following, a worldwide community, and so on. So the goals
for   future   @{B}Amiga@{UB}   technology   are   these:  ease  of  use,  affordability,
high-performance  multimedia,  an  open  architecture,  evolution  to  meet  new
standards, and of course fun.

What is the market that @{B}Amiga@{UB} can attack now? @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} identified the so-called
"digital  convergence"  market.  This  is the fusion of Internet access, digital
media  and  entertainment,  with  real  computers  underneath,  of course. It is
predicted  that there will soon be an electronic paradigm shift, with ubiquitous
digital  appliances.  Among  products  that might run @{B}AmigaOS@{UB} in the future are:
Internet  appliances,  games  machines  with  Internet  and DVD support, set-top
boxes,  sub-$500  computers,  combined  TV/game/computers  for  the  bedroom  or
kitchen,  @{B}PC@{UB}/TVs,  and  of  course  the conventional tower, desktop and portable
computers.

To  do  this,  @{B}AmigaOS@{UB}  needs  to  run  on  cheap,  fast hardware. @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} has
discovered,  through @{B}Gateway@{UB}'s connections, a chip in development that can offer
incredible speed at a low price starting from next year. (It's being kept secret
by  the  company  developing  it  -  apparently, partly for fear of losing their
current  good  relations  with  @{B}Intel@{UB}  before the chip is in production.) Quoted
performance  statistics  were:  5-10  times  faster  than  current  high-end  @{B}PC@{UB}
hardware,  400  million  pixels  per second 3D rendering (in 24 bit colour, with
whatever 3D effects you want), and decoding of 4 MPEG2 streams at the same time.
It  can also support high-speed Internet access using ADSL or similar protocols.
Of  course hardware isn't everything. @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} will need to provide breakway OS
technology - "convergence-ware" that will be perfectly suited to the sort of new
products that were mentioned above. This will mean a new OS core and new APIs.

The  next  slide  showed  how  @{I}Carl  Sassenrath @{UI} had reacted to the news. He was
present  at  a  demonstration  of the predecessor to this chip, along with @{B}Amiga
Inc@{UB}, and reportedly said: @{I}`It will be fun to again see the @{UB}Amiga @{UB}"blow the socks
off"  everything  else  that is out there.' @{UI}He said that @{B}REBOL Technologies@{UB} will
support the new @{B}AmigaOS@{UB}, which might interest you...

Now  comes the controversial bit. There is a long way from the current (1992/93)
@{B}Amiga   OS@{UB}   and  hardware  to  this  new  cutting-edge  chip  and  an  OS  with
"convergence-ware",  and that jump needs to be made in 18 months. The plan is to
do this in two steps. Current technology - @{B}AGA@{UB}, @{B}OS 3.1@{UB}, and @{B}680x0@{UB} - is described
as  @{B}"Amiga  Classic"@{UB}.  The  first  step from this will be to the @{B}"Amiga Bridge"@{UB},
which will consist of an @{B}x86 PC@{UB} running @{B}OS 4.0@{UB}, with an optional @{B}"Amiga Classic"@{UB}
bridge card. This will be the development platform for the next step. The use of
the  bridge  card  means that it can also run existing programs very fast, so it
may  well  be useful to non-developers too. The second step is to @{B}OS 5.0@{UB} running
on  a  new  architecture  in "digital convergence" products (which still include
conventional  computers). This will be basically software-compatible to the last
@{B}4.x@{UB} release.

What  are  the  building  blocks  for these two steps? Backward compatibility is
provided  by  the  bridge  card  (based on the @{B}Siamese@{UB} or @{B}InsideOut PCI@{UB} cards in
development)  or  by  @{B}UAE@{UB} (which should run just fine on the new chip!). For the
development platform, an OS kernel will be licensed from another company to save
time. The choice of kernel is yet to be announced. All along the way, there will
be  software  upgrades  to  meet  future  standards.  The  backing  of the Amiga
developer community is an essential.

The software timetable is as follows:
Developer program begins   Q3 of 1998
@{B}OS 4.0@{UB} release          November 1998
@{B}OS 5.0@{UB} ready                late 1999

The  developer  program will be handled by @{B}ICOA@{UB} together with @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} It will
provide support for porting applications and creating native applications for @{B}OS
4/5@{UB}.  Developers  will also be involved in the process of designing APIs for the
new  platform.  Developer kits and complete systems (@{B}PC@{UB} + bridge card + OS) will
be  available  from  @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}. There was a meeting on Saturday morning where an
outline  of  OS  plans was presented, but for the time being that information is
not public.

Key  targets  for  @{B}OS  4.x@{UB}  will  be:  @{B}OS 3.1@{UB} compatibility; advanced multimedia
performance;  support  for open standards (such as @{B}OpenGL@{UB}); real-time, threaded,
protected,  pre-emptive  multi-tasking;  a  new  GUI;  full  Internet support. I
believe  the planned features for @{B}OS 3.5@{UB} will be included in @{B}4.x@{UB}. @{B}OS 5.0@{UB} will be
the  final  result  of all the additions made to @{B}OS 4.0,@{UB} but will run on the new
chip instead of on @{B}x86 PCs@{UB}.

There  was  brief  mention of the importance of user groups and the existence of
the  @{B}UGN@{UB} as an interface to @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} - though not an exclusive one. There was a
@{B}UGN@{UB}  meeting  on  Sunday  morning,  but I didn't go to that. @{I}Jeff @{UI}also sought to
reassure  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  distributors that there was still plenty of opportunity to sell
"legacy"  software  and hardware, because new developments will retain backwards
compatibility. The possibilities for new products are of course greater.

Next to speak was @{I}Dr Allan Havemose, @{UI}the new Head of Technology and Development.
He has previously worked for @{B}Commodore-Amiga@{UB}, building up the European developer
network, and leading the OS development team for releases @{B}2.1@{UB}-@{B}3.1@{UB}. He didn't add
much  to  what @{I}Jeff Schindler @{UI}had said, and unfortunately I didn't take notes of
what he did say!

Some  more  details  that  came  out  in  response  to  questions. (These aren't
verbatim, but a combination of my notes and memory.)

Q. @{I}Why aren't you supporting the @{B}PPC @{UB}as a development platform? @{UI}
A. We're  negotiating with @{B}P5@{UB} for support for the @{B}PPC@{UB}. There should be news in a
   month.

Q. @{I}How do you plan to get a new kernel etc all in place by November? @{UI}
A. We're  teaming up with another OS corporation to use their kernel. @{B}BeOS@{UB}, @{B}Java
   OS@{UB}, @{B}Linux@{UB} and others are under consideration.

(Note, this is just for @{B}OS 4.0@{UB}.)

Q. @{I}What happened to @{B}OS 3.5 @{UB}? @{UI}
A. @{B}OS  3.5@{UB}  has been dropped. We looked at the plans and realised it wouldn't be
   worth doing, when we need to get @{B}OS 4.0@{UB} done by November.

Q. @{I}How can a little company like @{B}Amiga Inc @{UB}get access to this mystery chip? And @{UI}
   @{I}who is making it? @{B}Intel @{UB}? @{UI}
A. @{B}Gateway@{UB}  and its business partners are negotiating for the rights to use this
   chip. We can't say who is making it, but it's not @{B}Intel@{UB}.

Q. @{I}What will @{B}Amiga Inc @{UB}do to get @{B}PC @{UB}software companies to port to the @{B}Amiga @{UB}? @{UI}
A. We  can  use @{B}Gateway@{UB}'s contacts to try to persuade them to allow these ports,
   and we will support @{B}Amiga@{B} developers who want to work on them.

Q. @{I}Who's making the bridge card, and what processor will be on it? @{UI}
A. @{I}Mick Tinker @{UI}and @{I}Steve Jones @{UI}are working on it. It can use a @{B}68040@{UB} or @{B}68060@{UB}.

@node not39 "DEIMOS DESIGN FINALISES FUTURE PLANS"

@{FG Shine}DEIMOS DESIGN FINALISES FUTURE PLANS{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/29@{FG Text}

After  completing  our  analysis  of the current @{B}Amiga@{UB} market, Deimos Design has
finalised  it's  future  plans. Since early 1997, @{B}Deimos Design@{UB} has existed with
one  goal  in  mind,  to  support  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  with high specification games. In
addition  to  this,  we hoped for a modest return to cover our investment (time,
money and effort) in @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB}.

Since  then,  many  things (both good and bad) have happened. Unfortunately, one
overwhelming  factor  has remained - the buying user base has constantly eroded.
While  @{B}Amiga  Incorporated@{UB} have recently announced their plans for the future, a
new  influx  of  users  cannot  realistically  be expected for at least eighteen
months.

The  projected returns from the current market (even hopelessly optimistic ones)
do not justify the amount of work we have already invested in @{B}M&M@{UB} (on top of the
work  that  remains).  We  do  not see this situation as changing until the next
generation  of  machine  is  released.  By that time, @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB} will be "old
hat", many other similar games will have been released.

As  a  result, @{B}Deimos Design@{UB} has made the rather painful decision to concentrate
on  the @{B}PC@{UB} CD-ROM format, with the aid and support of @{B}Vulcan SW Limited@{UB}. This is
an  interim  decision, and one which can be reevaluated when the @{B}Amiga@{UB} market is
once again viable. For the immediate future however, we can no longer ignore the
economic realities.

As  a  sign of good faith to the many users whom have shown us their support, we
have  arranged  a  special  deal  with  @{B}The World Foundry@{UB}. We have disclosed all
information  pertaining  to  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB} version of @{B}Maim and Mangle@{UB} (source code,
design specs, and other materials) to @{B}The World Foundry@{UB} free of charge. They are
free to do with the project as they please, be that to work upon and release the
game in full, or use parts of it in their upcoming projects.

If  you  would  like to offer them your support for releasing @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB}, @{B}The
World Foundry@{UB} can be contacted at:

		@{B}http://www.worldfoundry.home.ml.org@{UB}

@node not41 "AMIGA INC. TRANSCRIPT INTERNATIONAL AMIGA' 98 TORONTO"

@{FG Shine}AMIGA INC. TRANSCRIPT INTERNATIONAL AMIGA' 98 TORONTO@{FG Text}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/05/31@{FG Text}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

@{I}No One can walk backwards into the Future. @{UI}

The  strategy  is clear, we can combine computer worlds with this concept and my
credo is, we will have a bright future... @{I}"Keep the momentum going"! @{UI}

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, Distinguished Guests.

I'm very pleased to join the @{B}International Amiga '98@{UB} here in Toronto again. Last
time that I visited Toronto was in 1995, three years ago already.

Let  me  give  you  a  short overview of what happened in London at the @{B}World of
Amiga@{UB}  two weeks ago. My collegues from our Research and Development department,
@{B}Amiga  Inc.@{UB}  have  announced  the  long  expected statement. In the morning, the
announcement  was  held  to  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  press  only  and  in the evening it was
disclosed to the broad public. It was even broadcast via the Internet.

Of  course  there  are a lot of different opinions, but my point of view is that
every  step  forward  is  a  positive step and a step into the future. How do we
explain our @{B}Amiga@{UB} fanatics that we are focusing our effort on the development of
the next generation to use the @{B}x86@{UB} platform? At that point, I want to thank @{I}Jeff
Schindler @{UI} who has done a great job in a very difficult situation.

Please  be sure we have a target for @{B}Amiga@{UB}. The @{B}Amiga classic@{UB} line will continue
to  support @{B}PPC@{UB} as an accellerator for the current systems supported by @{B}Phase 5@{UB},
@{B}Haage  & Partner@{UB}, and many more licensees. The @{B}Amiga OS 4.0@{UB} will support most of
your  existing  applications  through  software  emulation.  We are working with
another  third-party hardware vendor to develop a hardware add-on (@{B}Amiga classic@{UB}
card) that will make the bridge system backwards compatible.

While it is true that the next generation of @{B}Amiga@{UB} will use the @{B}x.86@{UB} platform as
a  development system, this is meant to be used as a bridge to take the @{B}Amiga@{UB} to
version  5.0.  @{B}Amiga  5.0@{UB}  is a brand-new @{B}Amiga@{UB}, using the most evolutionary and
revolutionary technology of software and hardware architectures. Later on, @{I}Jeff @{UI}
and his staff will go into further details.

Let's go back to sales and marketing.

The  new  @{B}Amigas@{UB},  as  well  as  the @{B}Amiga Classic@{UB}, will be distributed by @{B}Amiga
International,  Inc.@{UB}  the  sales  and  marketing  division. I don't want to miss
mentioning our new CD @{B}"Theme of Amiga"@{UB} performed by Annex at the @{B}World of Amiga@{UB}.
The  two  performances per day were such a success that the CD player broke down
during  the  dance act, because of the energetic performance of our dance group.
If  you  like the new song, you can buy the CD for 15 Canadian dollars here with
me. With the money that @{B}Amiga International@{UB} earns by selling the CD's, I plan to
establish  a fund to support the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Community. Until now, the fund amounts to
500 USD. Please watch our website @{B}www.amiga.de@{UB} as we've prepared a small musical
extraction for you.

What  else...  We  are  already  preparing our next @{B}Amiga@{UB} fair @{B}Computer '98@{UB} in
Cologne,  Germany.  I  started a new advertisement in the magazine @{B}Amazing Amiga@{UB}
and  @{B}Newtekniques@{UB}.  I  hope  as  much as possible of you will come to Cologne to
support  me  and  to see the news of our Research and Development company, @{B}Amiga
Inc.@{UB}  Of  course, our dance group @{B}Annex@{UB} will perform our new @{B}Amiga@{UB} theme. As you
may  know  in Cologne there exists (except the fair) the famous Kolsch beer, and
also very delicious German sausages which are available at our booth and free of
charge.

In  addition,  we plan to set up a stage to present the dance performance @{B}"Theme
of  Amiga"@{UB}  of @{B}Annex@{UB}, to hold meetings, speeches and presentations. This year we
expect between 35,000 and 45,000 visitors from November 13th to 15th. And I hope
I will meet many of you there too. I think it is worth coming.

@{B}Amiga@{UB} is back... Back for the future...

I'm  conviced that the drivers - our community - are already all set for another
exciting  race  with  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  for which @{I}Jeff @{UI}will develop suitable cars - our new
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  generation  - and I will broaden the road to go this street together with
you.

Thank you and enjoy the fair.

@node art1 "AMIGA SITUATION IN SPAIN"

@{FG Shine}AMIGA SITUATION IN SPAIN@{FG Text}

Many  people from outside Spain think that there are no @{B}Amiga@{UB} users still active
in Spain, but the truth is approximately here:

As  other countries, been an @{B}Amiga@{UB} user today is very difficult, all of you know
how difficult is to get a decent soft/hard support in your local area, is almost
impossible,  you  have  to  use  mail  order  due  the  few  places to get @{B}Amiga@{UB}
hard/soft,  and  newcomers  to  the  machine or people interested on it, have to
leave  it  due  the lack of publicity and information on their city, and is even
worse  in  Spain,  where  the  official support of the @{B}Amiga@{UB} is NIL, the Spanish
market  now is better than some years ago, but it need a lot of help to start to
go up.

Only  a  few shops exist in Spain, but they are very dedicated and even some can
be  @{B}Amiga@{UB}-only  shops, so the market is still viable here, but the big expansion
of  clonics, the little information about the @{B}Amiga@{UB} and the old @{B}Amiga@{UB} equipment,
the market is not as big as it should.

Some years ago, the Spanish version of @{B}Amiga World@{UB} was on almost every kiosk but
since  the  @{B}Commodore@{UB}  fall,  the magazine had to close, leaving a whole country
without @{B}Amiga@{UB} information in Spanish.

Then  a new magazine was born, it was made by @{B}Amiga@{UB} users who loved the machine,
the  mag lasts some years informing and giving hopes to all the @{B}Amiga@{UB} users lost
in Spain, users who do not know any @{B}Amigans@{UB} in their cities.

But  now,  one year ago, the latest printed @{B}Amiga@{UB} magazine closed, so many users
had  to  sell theirs machine because the magazine was their only connection with
the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Community, mainly users that do not have Internet.

The  magazine  did  not have too much to do compared to other magazines from UK,
but some issues were great, even one had a Cover-CD!

The  latest issues of the magazine, were very poor, the editors were planning to
abandon  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB} market so the collaborators had to do almost the whole work,
well, the magazine was getting thinner every month and so on.

Finally, the magazine officially was 'frozen' but in my opinion, it was dead and
buried... It was a shame, It did a social function.

Another  great  focus on @{B}Amiga@{UB} information is an @{B}Amiga@{UB} section named @{I}AmigaMania @{UI}
in  a consoles-only-magazine which takes over 4 pages! mainly covering games and
answering questions to readers interested on the @{B}Amiga@{UB}!

Also  the  same  person who writes that section, whose name is @{I}Raul Monton@{UI} , aka
@{I}The Punisher@{UI}, writes in a national newspaper computer's supplement another @{B}Amiga@{UB}
section, in this case, covering news and events!

An excellent Work!

But  in  Spain there are some 'electronic' magazines, the pioneer was @{B}Fanzine@{UB} an
e-zine  covering  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  and  scene  topics,  then  after 13 issues, the mag was
closed,  other mags like @{B}Digital Fanzine@{UB} or @{B}LLFB's Docs@{UB} were born, but nowadays,
after some projects, the magazines are @{B}Trashcan@{UB} a scene related Mag, @{B}Revolution,
the  Mag@{UB},  @{B}LLFB's  Docs@{UB} and the AmigaGuide based @{B}AmigaChannel@{UB} which appear every
two months, covering latest news, tutorial, games, articles... 100% @{B}Amiga@{UB}!.

The  most  recent  Amiga  e-zines  are  this  one  which  you  are  reading now,
@{B}AmiChannelNews@{UB} and the forthcoming @{B}Revolution, The Mag CD-edition@{UB}!

The  next  printed  magazine is a project which seems very interesting, in a few
months we hope to be able to read it.

The  only  @{B}Amiga@{UB} related book in Spanish appeared some years ago, it's title @{B}El
Libro  del  Usuario  de  Amiga@{UB}  (@{B}The  Amiga  User's Book@{UB}) this book give you an
introduction  to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} environment and provides some tools and help to start
programming  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB} using @{B}Assembler@{UB}, excellent stuff, a must for every @{B}Amiga@{UB}
programmers.

Spain has been a good place to organize parties and little shows with the @{B}Amiga@{UB},
never a big show like @{B}WOA@{UB} or other show has been done here, only parties, but no
official presence at all.

We  hope to change this, with the forthcoming, @{B}Radykal Amiga Party@{UB} which will be
the  biggest @{B}Amiga@{UB} show in Spain ever, featuring conferences, competitions and a
lot of @{B}Amigas@{UB} everywhere!.

The lack of information in Spanish has been always a problem to newcomers to the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}, and it is difficult to get proper books.

The  release  of  @{B}Developer  CD  1.1@{UB}  helped  some  users,  but others feel very
difficult  to  start @{B}Amiga@{UB} programming in @{B}C or @{B}ASM@{UB}, that why low level languages
like @{B}Blitz Basic@{UB} or mainly @{B}Amos@{UB}, are very popular here. :-(

Some  people  had  the  clever  idea  to create a @{B}Coders Club@{UB} as the one held by
@{B}Revolution  the  Mag@{UB}  but  the main problem is the language and lack of official
help by @{B}Amiga. Int.@{UB}

But  not  everything  is  bad  in  Spain,  there  are great programmers and some
demo-scene  groups  like  @{B}Capsule@{UB},  @{B}Network@{UB},  @{B}Goblins@{UB}, @{B}AmigaCircle@{UB} or the recent
@{B}Dream's  Day@{UB}  but  the  most notable software creators are the people behind the
great  Award  Winning  WYSIWYG HTML editor @{B}Metal Web@{UB} which newer version is 2.0.
Congratulation!

There  are  people  working  with @{B}Amiga@{UB} doing arcade machines based in @{B}Amiga@{UB} and
even  development  for  Virtual Reality projects, but rarely their works and the
@{B}Amiga@{UB} name are known on the mass media.

In  my  opinion,  apart  from the usual personal use, the @{B}Amiga@{UB} is used in Spain
mainly  for  graphic  works:  video  editing, local TV stations, titles, graphic
design for webs, videogames or logos, etc.

The  little  support  given by non @{B}Amiga@{UB} medias, has killed the former users who
bought  a  @{B}A500@{UB}  and did not know how to upgrade their machines or even does not
know that @{B}Commodore@{UB} did machines like the @{B}A4000@{UB} and @{B}A1200@{UB}!.

The  most  active  users  in  Spain  as  in many countries, are connected to the
Internet  and  join some clubs like @{B}CUAE@{UB}, @{B}ACM@{UB} or @{B}SAUG@{UB}, thanks to these users and
their web sites and internal publication, users that do not have Internet can be
informed instantly.

The  basic  processor that almost every @{B}Amiga@{UB} user has is a @{B}030@{UB} 50mhz, been very
popular  the  @{B}Blizzard@{UB} series, but also there is a big number of users that have
@{B}68060  Amigas@{UB}  or even @{B}PowerPC@{UB}, now the @{B}PowerPC@{UB} fever is here, despite the @{B}Amiga
Inc.@{UB} announcement, the @{B}PowerPC@{UB} are selling very well, and everybody wants to get
a @{B}PowerPC@{UB}.

Now  with  the new @{B}Amiga@{UB} reborn, a lot of medias are looking at the @{B}Amiga@{UB} again,
we all hope to see the @{B}Amiga@{UB} again where it should be, and all the Spanish @{B}Amiga@{UB}
users will be here waiting to see it!

@{B}Amiga@{UB} Rulez!

@node art2 "ELASTIC DREAMS"

@{FG Shine}ELASTIC DREAMS@{FG Text}

Many  people who have just bought their @{B}PowerPC@{UB} boards and thinking if they have
done the right thing, Now have a excuse to see their processors screamming!.

I  only  can  say  that @{B}Elastic Dreams@{UB} is the most revolutionary graphic retouch
program  on the @{B}Amiga@{UB}, the requester and menu age is over, everything here is as
intuitive as possible.

I  would  to tell that @{B}ED@{UB} is the only program in the market that do that, but on
other  platforms  exists  a  program  more  or  less  as  @{B}ED@{UB},  which  is  highly
"inspirated"  on the famous @{B}Kai's Power Goo@{UB} so if you know that program, you can
imaginate the power of @{B}ED@{UB}.

Before  starting,  I  have  to  say  that  @{B}ED@{UB}  is  a  graphic retouch, morphing,
composition, and animation program in real-time, that mean we don't have to wait
to  see  the desired effect, every deformation that we make in the image will be
shown instanstly, well, in fact, its depends on processor, but on a @{B}040@{UB} at 40mhz
or less you can get more that satisfactory effects, been incredible on a @{B}060/PPC@{UB}
equiped @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

@{B}Elastic  Dreams@{UB}  consists  of  three programs: @{B}Composer@{UB}, @{B}Manager@{UB} and the @{B}Elastic
Part@{UB}, the editor itself.

@{B}Composer@{UB} is where we can "join" images together and see its combination.

The  @{B}Elastic Part@{UB}: Where you can realize the full power of @{B}ED@{UB}, you can apply any
operator to deform, blend, strech, or add Especial Effects.

It's also possible to create animations with ease and see how the images deform,
Everything is made in real time!

The third part is named @{B}Manager@{UB} where the whole program is configurated, you can
select the background of the program and the level of quality, anti-alias, etc.

@{B}ED@{UB} supports some third-party programs, it can scan pictures using @{B}Scaquix@{UB} and it
prints using @{B}Turbo Print@{UB}.

When  doing  animation, frames can be saved one by one to proccess them later or
you can make animations in @{B}IFF@{UB} format or use the custom @{B}ED@{UB}-anim format.

In  every moment, the program works in 24bits, that's 16 millions of colors!, so
the  quality  is  ensured,  and  of  course  the program can also be used on @{B}AGA@{UB}
machines with incredible results.

@{B}Elastic Dreams@{UB} has a huge graphic format support:

@{B}
Load: Acbm, Alias, Bmp, Datatypes, Fits, Gif, Iff, Iff24, Impulse, Ipbm, Jpeg,
      MacPaint, Pbm, Pcx, Pgm, PhotoCD, Png, Ppm, Psd, Qrt, Raw RGB, Rendition,
      Rle, Scanquix, Sgi, Sunraster, Svg, Targa, Tiff, Tim!!, WaveFront, Yuvn

Save: Alias, Iff, Iff Deep, Impulse, Jpeg, Pbm, Pgm, Ppm, Qrt, Rendition, Yuvn
@{UB}

Also  the  authors promise any module needed for other graphic format, always if
you are a registered user.

We can found some effects like Waves, Ripples, whirls, Emboss, Strech and more!.

Due to the big size of 24bits images, the more the memory, the better result you
will get.

I only want to say that @{B}Elastic Dreams@{UB} is a hightly recommended program suitable
for  professionals  and also for novices users because its excellent GUI and the
ease  the  create  especial  effects  which  before  @{B}ED@{UB} where too complicated or
difficult to achieve.

If  programs  like  this one, get enough support from users who buy it, I'm sure
that we will get more quality software like this for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

I recommend you to see how it works and enjoy the power of @{B}PowerPC@{UB} boards.

What are you waiting for to install it?

@{FG Shine}IN THE NEXT ISSUE...@{FG Text}

It seems that the month of June will be very quiet. Another month like May could
be fatal for my poor heart. There is not any @{B}Amiga@{UB} show, it is not likely a mess
like the generated after the announcement of the @{B}WOA@{UB}.

However,  some  things  must be clarified in this month being the most important
the  announcement  of  the  core of the new OS. Would be @{B}BeOS@{UB}? @{B}Linux@{UB}? Who knows.
@{B}Amiga  Inc.@{UB}  has  promised  to  clarify  things  in the next 30 days. I hope so.
Anyway,  we  will  hang  on  @{B}Amiga  Inc.@{UB}  words and we will offer you up-to-date
news in the next issue of...
