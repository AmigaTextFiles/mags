<P>
HAMPSHIRE, ENGLAND -- 24 November 1997 -- Index Information Ltd is
proud to announce that the first production Access computer
successfully powered into life on 12 November 1997.

<P><A HREF="http://www.cix.co.uk/~index/">Index Information Ltd</a> have 
been developing a new range of computer
designs based around the Amiga AGA Chip Set and AmigaOS V3.1 Operating
System for over 2 years. After extensive research and development,
prototyping, pre-production and user trials we are now shipping the
"Access", the first all new Licensed Amiga in volume production in the
Western World.

<P>Mick Tinker, Managing Director of Index Information Ltd; "We have been
concentrating on corporate applications for the Amiga for many years.
Corporate applications cover a wide range of fields such as kiosks,
training & education, presentations, advertising, video production,
embedded machine controllers with interactive control interfaces,
Scala script players, etc. In general the wide range of applications
and the often-substantial volumes they achieve are not well known to
the general public, the producers preferring to concentrate on their
solution, rather than the underlying technology. The Access is the
first product to be specifically designed to address this market."

<P>Those able to attend the Computer '97 exhibition will have had the
opportunity to see a production Access working on the Amiga
International Inc., stand.

<P>The Access is a completely new design from the ground up, not a
repackaged A1200 or A4000. It incorporates the core Amiga Chips;
Alice, Paula and Denise, and 8520 CIA's. Many other chips seen in
older Amiga designs, such as the Gayle, Budgie, Akiko, Bridgette and
Gary chips have been replaced by a fresh new chip design which offers
the benefits of modern techniques and technological advances. An
example of the benefits this bestows on the product is a 30 percent
increase in processor access speed to CHIP memory.

<P>The production Revision 1.3 motherboard has additional features that
will broaden its appeal and satisfy a wider range of application
needs. The most obvious is the introduction of an option for the
68EC030 processor running at 28MHz to fitted at manufacture, boosting
the performance of the base machine. Support has also been added for a
combined MPEG1/Genlock unit that is currently at the prototype stage.

<P>Full details about the product can be found at the companies web site
