Hi,
<p>
This issue's editorial for the What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine, starts out on a bit of a bad note, as the What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine web site at Koyote is no more and this is because the 
offer of web space has been withdrawn due to the time constraints, but I'd like to 
thank, <B>BCo</B> for the use of their web site.
<p>
But don't worry, What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine can still be found on the 
web, at: <p> <A HREF="http://www.sonic.net/~alanwall/whota/index.html">http:/www.sonic.net/~alanwall/whota/index.html</A>.  
<p>
This issue contains a <A HREF="survey.htm">survey</A>, which I hope you'll 
fill in and send back to me as I was asked by Geosync Media last week, to provide 
information of the specifications of the Amigas that you're using currently.
<p>
This issue contains a number of articles on the Computer97 show, an article 
on <A HREF="dce1.htm">DCE Amiga Compatibles</A>, another article on 
Foundation, but there are three articles in this issue which you'll find of great 
interest adn they are <A HREF="ainov3.htm">Petro Tyschtschenko's Speech at 
Computer '97</A>, <A HREF="fratzengeballer.htm">FratzenGeballer, Follow-up 
To Trapped 2</A> and <A HREF="indexcomp1.htm">Index Information Ltd 
Announces The Immediate Availability Of The Access Computer Powered By 
Amiga</A> articles, but Myst also turns up in number of articles this issue as well.
<p>
You'll notice that this issue is bit smaller than last two issues, and this is due to the 
lack of news, which is evident in the News Section and this issue's News In Brief. 
As usual, the collection of articles split more or less evenly by game news and the 
more serious stuff.  There is only one exclusive this issue, the <A 
HREF="moremaepics.htm">More MAE Pics</A> article, which contains some 
more pics from MAE which didn't make it quite in time for the last issues, with 
many thanks going out again to <B>Alan Crandall</B> who sent the pics them.
<P>
The anticipated announcement of what AI's New Amigas would be like, did'nt 
materialise at Computer97, but more information on when OS upgrades would be 
appearing was welcomed.
<P>
Now this month's, Site Of The Month is <A 
HREF="http://www.rebol.com">Rebol</A>, which is Carl Sassenrath's vision of 
what computing should be like and not the way that it is now.  An alpha version is 
only currently available to those on the E-mail list.  Keep an eye on this site.
<P>
Check out <A HREF="links.htm">Links</A> for the latest additions to my Links Section.
<p>
Before, I end this issue's editorial, I'm still accepting anymore offers of free web 
space as I'd like to have a mirror site as well, if you have any, then e-mail me at:
<p>
<A 
HREF="mailto:imortimer@jupmqljb.demon.co.uk">imortimer@jupmqljb.demon.co.
uk</A>
<P>
And also I'm looking contributions of news articles or links, they will be greatly 
appreciated, so just e-mail them to me at:
<p>

HREF="mailto:imortimer@jupmqljb.demon.co.uk">imortimer@jupmqljb.demon.co.

Hope that you enjoy this issue, and will read the upcoming issues.
