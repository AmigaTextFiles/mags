<b><P>Ladies and Gentlemen<br>
Dear Madame<br>
Dear Sir<br>
Dear Amiga friends<br>
</b>

<P>The past has shown that there exists a market for Amiga which we can
also see at the fair here in Cologne.

<P>In 1993 there were 45,000 visitors at the Fair in Cologne, 1995
already 65,000 visitors an this year we expect more than 70,000
visitors. Those figures are quite respectable and it shows the big
faith and the enormous community spirit towards Amiga. Of course these
figures are containing interested people from the PC market.

<P>Today I will tie up to my speech of last year, in which I said: "Due
to the current situation, we do not have a fair booth this year. But
I´m very optimistic to attend the exhibition in Cologne with an own
fair booth in 1997"

<P>"Amiga is indestructible - Amiga is alive!"

<P>This, my dear friends, was the end of my speech last year.

<P>And at that time I was already convinced to have a comeback and that's
why I'm here today, I'm the living evidence.

<P>In my speech already quoted above, I said those days: "We are looking
for further potential Investors." We don't give up. We will see what's
going to happen."

<P>Glance backward in the past of Amiga and compare Amiga with other
companies. Than you will ask yourself:

<ul>
<li> How many companies exist which survived two bankruptcies?
<LI> How many brands survive two bankruptcies?
</ul>

<P>And all this in times in which no new products exist or are developed.
And in times in which nobody believes in the future of our brand.

<P>But Amiga is still there.<br>
Amiga is alive <br>

<P>The development must go on faster and more specifically with Amiga
too. Many professional developers, but even private tinkerers have
meanwhile developed a few good ideas for Amiga.

<P>We all, from Amiga, are open for all new ideas. We have already
made a new start. A new start with the support of a company which
believes in the future of Amiga - Gateway 2000.

<P>But who is <A HREF="http://www.gateway.com/">Gateway 2000</a>?? 
Gateway 2000 is a large and solid
American enterprise with more than 10,000 employees world wide. 1996
Gateway sold more than 1.9 million PCs. The turnover amounted to 5
billion US dollars. The net profit was 250 million US dollars after tax.
In the United States Gateway 2000 belongs to 500 biggest companies.
Gateway 2000 has already awarded many prizes for their product range
and their services. This shows what a great potential is behind AMIGA
International, Inc.

<P>The policy of Gateway 2000 for Amiga is: <A 
HREF="http://www.amiga.de/">Amiga International</a> is
supposed to operate independent on the market. As independent as
possible For that purpose AMIGA International will be supported by
Gateway 2000 wherever it is useful and synergies can be made.

<P>Our strategy, the strategy of AMIGA International has three cornerstones!

<ul>
<li> Supporting the existing Amiga community
<li> Leveraging the existing Amiga technology through licensing
<li> Assisting in developing new products based on open standards to the home 
computer and video/graphics market.
</ul>

<P>Let me explain the above mentioned goals.

<P>The support of our Amiga users was already in past one of our
cornerstone. Even in times when Amiga worked under sequestration,
Amiga succeeded almost always our customers advice and help. In future
we will not change this policy, much more, we will enforce the
support.

<P>Our second cornerstone are the license agreements. Wherever it is
sensible and possible, we will reach license agreements. Sensible and
possible means: We reach only license agreements with companies if it
is of advantage to Amiga users and to the market, the Amiga technology
remains compatible and the licensee grants to pull in one direction
with Amiga.

<P>Presently we reached 17 license contracts about soft and hardware.

<P>The third cornerstone is the development of new Amiga models and to
upgrade the existing Amiga products.

<P>As you may know, Amiga has nothing developed for years. But new
products are essential to exist in a dynamic market. For the
development of new products, we need time. Time and money. Money which
was not always available in the past few years, but with Gateway 2000
we are have found a solid basis.

<P>We have founded a company which is responsible for Research and
Development. The name is Amiga Inc., a wholly owned company of Gateway
2000. Amiga Inc. is situated in Sioux City close to Gateway 2000..

<P>The tasks of AMIGA International, Inc and Amiga Inc. are clear
defined. Amiga Inc. develops products and AMIGA International, Inc. is
responsible for sales and marketing world wide and for the settlement
of license contracts.

<P>We already started with some new developments. We hope to be able to
present a new product for Christmas 1998. This will be a Computer
between PC and Game machine. Which means a Computer, Game Machine, TV,
Settop-Box, TVD and Internet access device all in one device.

<P>If you think about that an Amiga OS which doesn't need more than a one
Megabyte Ram, than you see that our preconditions are nearly perfect.
Our Amiga has a extraordinary good relation towards price and
efficiency. The advantages of Amiga are the Operating System. This has
been proven in the past, and the future will show the same. Prices for
new developments will approximately range from 250 to 800 US dollar.

<P>What concerns the software, we are planning to put the new Operating
System 3.5 onto the market, hopefully in Spring 1998. In Winter 1998
we estimate to present further upgrades. The image and the product
position of Amiga is still very good. And on this we built. So, why
resign of something which has shown its efficiency in the past time of
crisis and without Amiga wouldn't have survived on the market.

<P>We don't want to invent the wheel again, but we will do our best to
develop Amiga on a high standard. Therefore we will find and look for
co-operations.

<P>We will serve our customers honest and open minded. We will outsource
services and we will look for new distributors And we will try to
operate with only a few employees.

<P>Ladies and Gentlemen, last year Amiga did not participate with a
booth, but this year you will find us in building 11.1 booth number D
42. Our booth has approx. 200 square yards, and everybody is kindly
invited to visit us.

<P>Before my closing words, I would like to thank a certain group very
very much. It is the group of Amiga Magazines I´m talking about. Thank
you for the support in the past years and especially within the
difficult years of bankruptcy. Thank you again for that.

<P>Please allow me some final words. I think I can tell you with clear
conscience that my last confidential words of the year before, came
already true.

<P>Today I had the great pleasure again to stand here and to talk to you
about our future plans coming up in the next few years and I´m
convinced that we will meet each other several times within the next
years and we will be still saying:

<P>Amiga is indestructible - Amiga is alive

<P>My personal opinion is: Amiga has a bright future ahead!

<P>Thank you for being here
