HEIGHT=223>If 
any of you have done a complex and professional looking 3D model of something 
they could use for Fortress of Fear (e.g. dragons, humans, monsters, castles, 
weapons,  etc.), you can send them to the Developer for possible use.  You will get 
full credit and will receive the full game free.
<br>
<br>
Try to send the objects in multiple formats like dxf, Imagine, Lightwave, Maxon 
Cinema etc. as these are the best ways for them to use the object.  This also applies 
to Audiofiles (.mod, .wav, Midi, mpeg-3 or whatsoever), fonts, etc. Just send in 
everything they can possibly use for a game like Fortress of Fear and the possible 
reward can be a free copy.

You can e-mail your objects and so on to:-<br><br><center><A
