FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  19-Nov-97

<P><b>TWO BIG BOOSTS FOR THE AMIGA!</b>

<P>Every Amiga owner needs a utility to bannish the dreaded "Not Validated"
and "Checksum Error" requesters. As well, every Amiga owner should be
connected to the Internet.  Former Commodore-Amiga Software Engineer Dale
L. Larson is doing something now to bring these both tools to more of the
Amiga community, and he's asking for your help.

<P><A HREF="http://www.iam.com/">Intangible Assets Manufacturing</a>, 
Larson's company, is immediately slashing
50% off the list price of it's two most popular and widely praised Amiga
products, <A HREF="http://www.iam.com/amiga/disksalv.html">DiskSalv4</a> 
and the book "<A HREF="http://www.iam.com/amiga/cya.html">Connect Your 
Amiga! A Guide to the
Internet, LANs, and BBSs</a>".  The new prices are US$20 and US$12
respectively.

<P>Even if you are already connected to the Internet, the book provides
valuable background and reference information, as well as information on
local networking and other communications topics.

<P>DiskSalv4, by Dave Haynie, is simply the premier Amiga disk utility, a
must-have for every Amiga owner.

<P>Asked how he could afford to offer these reductions, Larson replied "I
can't afford not to.  The Amiga community is in a difficult place while we
all wait for new technology, and this year has been difficult for my company
financially in the Amiga market. There is a method to my madness."

<P>"DiskSalv is a utility that should be a part of the OS, and connection to
the Internet is a vital part of modern computing that is easy and cheap on
other platforms.  Getting this stuff out there for every single Amiga is
necessary to the very survival of the Amiga. By making my products so
inexpensive, I hope to give the Amiga a needed boost, and I hope to make
up the difference by selling a much larger quantity. At this price, no
Amiga user has an excuse not to own these great products.  It's a win-win
situation for IAM and for the community."

<P>Larson added, "Please pass this press release along to your friends, user
groups and others.  (User Groups: Contact me for details or see
www.iam.com/amiga/groups.html for even lower pricing for bulk orders made
in the next six weeks.) Thank you for helping us help the Amiga!"
including the book "Connect Your Amiga! A Guide to the Internet, LANs,
BBSs and Online Services", DiskSalv4, MRBackup, MegaBall4 and others. IAM
also publishes Internet-related books "Torn Shapes of Desire:  Internet
Erotica" and "Lineland: Mortality and Mercy on Pynchon-L@Waste.Org."
