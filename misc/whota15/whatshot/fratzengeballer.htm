<P>
Following on from a previous article on the follow-up to Trapped 2, which was in 
November's News In Brief, I can now
bring you more information and screenshots.  The game, which will be called
'FratzenGeballer' is the third in the series of 3D games from Oxyron.  The first
game 'Trapped' was a slight dissapointment, however, Trapped 2 went on to
improve on it in a massive way, hopefully 'FratzenGeballer' will continue this.
improvment.<P>

The game will contains the same 3D engine which is used in Trapped 1&2,
however, it will not be sold as a sequal but instead as a completly new game.
The storyline of the game will be far different from the first one giving it a
whole new feel and also allowing buyers of the earlier two games to enjoy it
too.<P>

The game, I'm told, has been improved in many different areas.  It features an
'unbeliveable 3D engine' which boasts many spectacular effects such as improved
texture mapping, Mipmapping, Dithering, Lensflare and some excellent light
effects all of which will be improved over the earlier engine versions.<P>

The game itself takes place in a Space Station, you will have to fight your way
over more then 15 levels of action.  The game will have all new enemys with some
excellent new weapons in which to kill them with.  I have also been told that it
will include many new features not seen in the previous 2 games.<P>

The game is set of an early summer '98 release with a demo being released very
soon.<P>
