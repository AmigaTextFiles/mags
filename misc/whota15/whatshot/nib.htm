Welcome to the News In Brief Section.  This page contains all articles from 16th - 
30th November.  Enjoy.
<P>
<CENTER><H2>Latest Alive MediaSoft Info</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Alive MediaSoft have revealed that their second game will be called Arcangel, 
which will be a very high spec with it requiring 16 Fast Ram, CD-Rom only and will 
be made PPC compatable.  Currently the game is all on paper and they have only 
one programmer dedicated to bringing it to our faithful machine, but being locked 
away in the broom cupboard all on his own is not doing him any good, and he is 
lonely and in need of a friend. 
<p>
The Haunted, another game being developed by Alive MediaSoft is expected to be 
out early in the new year.
<CENTER><H2>Latest On Quake For The Amiga</H2></CENTER>
<P>
News is just coming in that Quake for the Amiga was being run at the Computer 97 
show in Cologne.  It was believed to have been run on PPC and was said to look 
good although a little slow.
<br>
<br>
There were no details on who intends to port it fully for release, and at present this 
News has not yet been confirmed.  If anyone is aware of any information relating 
to Quake being shown at the show then please e-mail me.
