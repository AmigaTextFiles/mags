Yes, thats right, Myst is finally complete.  It has been approved by Cyan and is
now entering the final beta testing stage.  Boxes and manuals are already
complete so it is just a matter of CD duplication, packaging and shipping.<P>

The game should be available by December the 1st at the latest, hopefully even
earlier.   The game will be available for $65 direct from PXL Computers, look at
your local suppliers for prices in other currencies.<P>

Myst, which is the best selling game of all-time has been eagerly awaitied by
the Amiga public ever since it was announced by Clickboom earlier this year. 
Amiga Myst will be available in two versions, English & German.  This is because
it was impossible to put versions for both languages on the same CD due to
space limitations.<P>

Initially the game will only be released as AGA only, this is because
the CyberGFX version us not yet complete, however, all of the GFX files required
will be on the CD so it will only be a matter of downloading the CyberGFX code
off the Clickboom website, Aminet or from magazine coverdisks when it is ready
(It should be sometime in the first week of December).  The same goes for the
PPC optimised version, this is also not quite ready yet and will be made
avaialble as soon as it is.<P>

As I'm sure many of you know Myst will be 100% OS Friendly and will be fully
multi-tasking.<P>

As for the Amiga required to play the game, well, you'll need a pretty decent
one to be able to play it at a good speed.   For the AGA version the minimum
spec is a 68020 CPU with 8Mb RAM, a 2x CD-ROM drive and 5Mb HD space.  The
minimum recommended spec is 68030 with 16Mb RAM.  To play the game at it's 
best
a 68060 with 16Mb RAM and a 12x CD-ROM drive is recommended.  This is the 
same
for the CyberGFX version apart from the recommended spec is an 040 instead of an
060.<P>

Myst is a game that had been eaglrly awaited for a long time now, lets hope it
does not disappoint.....<P>
