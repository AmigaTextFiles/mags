Brief</a> which revealed more details on this up coming game from author Paul 
Burkey.

align=left>A demo has now been released so now you have the chance to see 
some of these features in action and get a feel of this mixture between Civilization 
and Settlers.<br>

<img src=images/fdcastl.gif alt="Castle" WIDTH=68 HEIGHT=134 
align=right>But 
some have experienced problems and to help you download the latest version of 
this demo and help in getting it run, a support page has been set up by Sadeness 
Software. <br>
<br>
I would strongly recommend that you visit this site if you want to try out the 
Foundation demo.  An AGA version and CyberGraphX version are available.
