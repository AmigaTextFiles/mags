For Immediate Release <br>
November 21st, 1997<br>

<P><A HREF="http://www.nationalamiga.com/">National Amiga</a> is proud 
to announce its Toaster/Flyer SCSI Case to the rest
of the world.

<P>"We have commonly only sold this only to our local clients for use in their
Toaster/Flyer setups, but have neglected to promote it as a seperate item to
the rest of the world."

<P>This case will house the hard drives, tape drives and CD-ROM drives that are
commonly used in Toaster/Flyer systems. It will also provide cooling to keep
drives running at optimum levels.

<P>It's a stylish looking box built of high quality, and is also rather simple to
assemble. All drives mount on snap in rails for easy maintenance.

<P>It has been designed with the Flyer Octopus cable in mind since there are 3
Centronics SCSI connections on the back for the three seperate SCSI channels
that the Flyer uses.

<P>Powered ISA slots are also available inside for adding in time base correctors
and vector scopes.

<P>For more information as well as pictures of this case, please view our
website at <A 
HREF="http://www.nationalamiga.com/flyercase.html">http://www.nationalamiga.c
om/flyercase.html</A>. A salesperson will
also gladly consult over the phone.

<P>National Amiga also produces smaller SCSI cases for use with any SCSI system.
Custom configured to your needs.

<P>National Amiga was the first online mailorder source for the entire range of
Amiga products and services. Support for Amiga users around the world through
sales and technical support has been top priority throughout the tough times
of the Amiga computer.
