<P><A HREF="http://www.asimware.com/">Asimware</a> is proud to 
announce the availability of the demo version of our
forthcoming MasterISO v2.0; our next generation CD-R/RW writing software
program.

<P>Building upon our years of experience in CD-ROM and CD-R software with
AsimCDFS and MasterISO v1, we have re-designed MasterISO v2.0 from the
ground up to provide an extremely stable CD-R/RW writing program.
MasterISO v2.0 represents the input of hundreds of our users in both the
design and testing phases.  MasterISO v2.0 includes the features users have
requested, organized in a logical and easy-to-use fashion.

<P>Some new features in MasterISO include:
<ul>
<li> Disc-At-Once writing;
<li> CD to CD-R/RW copying;
<li> Full File Manager for editing directory structures;
<li> On-the-fly writing from hard drive to CD-R/RW;
<li> Rock Ridge and Joliet file system support;
<li> Incremental multisession;
<li> Jukebox support for the Elms DVL (optional).
</ul>

<P>We believe that MasterISO represents the future of CD-R/RW mastering
software for the Amiga platform.  But don't take our word for it - download
our demonstration version, from either Aminet or our WWW site, and give it
a try yourself.

<P>MasterISO v2.0 is scheduled for an end-of-November 1997 release.

<P>Asimware Innovations Inc.  is an Amiga software development house
specializing in CD-ROM , CD-R and CD-RW technologies.  Our current product
line includes AsimCDFS, MasterISO, Texture Heaven 1 & 2, PhotoCD Manager and
Audio Thunder.
