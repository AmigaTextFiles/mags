The following article is from the Amiga Nutta web site.
<p>
I recently met up with the World Foundry team on IRC and the following
interview took place.  World Foundry are the team who ware currently working on
Explorer 2260 and Maim & Mangle. It is made up of Chris Page, George 
Hornmoen
and Ed Collins. I will hopefully be bringing you further interviews with the
World Foundry team and other games developers in the future.  BTW, the Dave
you see popping up with a few comments now and then is me. :)<P> <HR

<B><I>First of all maybe a little introduction is in order.... Who are
you, what do you do in WF, and also out of it etc...</I></B><BR>

<B>Chris</B> I'm Chris Page, I'm the main designer of
Explorer2260 and currently 3rd year student at Manchester university
(England).<BR>
<B>George</B> OK here goes: George Hornmoen, I work for
Atlantic Systems Group in Fredericton, NB, Canada. I've got a university degree
in Computer Science, graduated in may, 1996. In World Foundry - main designer 
of
M&amp;M, and responsible for the network protocols used in our games.<BR>

<B>Ed</B> I'm Ed Collins, recently graduated from
University of Ulster with a HND in Computing and has been helping Chris develop
Explorer with graphics, CEG work and some programming.<P>

<B><I>How did you all start programming on the Amiga?</I></B><BR>
<B>Chris</B> I started back in ohh.. 88 using amiga BASIC :) I then progressed
through AMOS, AMOSPro and Blitz finally ending up in C and ASM as they are the
only ones which give me the control I need. I have entirely taught myself,
mostly from books and examples.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> I only really had experience with programming from my Uni
course. I had tried Blitz Basic and Amos but not till recently started learning
C to write one of the game editors for Explorer. In this case the Star map
editor. Chris has provided a lot of help in my learning the language.<BR>
<B>George</B> Hmm - I think it was back in 94.  I had toyed around with 
some
little programs, but nothing serious. After seeing most of the good games
companies abandon us, I started working on a few ideas. I finally settled upon
M&amp;M last year, but after its done I hope to resurrect and spice up some of the
old ideas.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> I tend to code mostly in C unless speed/efficency are
paramount as I don't like asm a great deal. I used to use DICE but I'll shortly
be using StormC (as soon as Blittersoft get it in stock, or hell freezes over
(whichever happens first)).<BR>
<B>George</B> I started in C, and then dipped my
toes in Assembler. I prefer C for most things, except when assembler is
necessary.<BR>
<B>George</B> I didn't get a copy of the RKRM's until January 96,
so up until then I was essentially crippled.<P>

<B><I>How did you folks meet and found World Foundry?</I></B><BR>
<B>Chris</B> Ermm.. I think it was mostly because of Explorer.... I was making 
a
lot of noise about it and Ed and George got in contact with me.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> I believe it was Ed who contacted me first, I nearly turned him 
down
too :)<BR>
<B>Chris</B> Then George contacted me and mentioned M&amp;M <BR>
<B>Ed</B> I saw the mail posting on the Pure Amiga mail list saying about this
new game Explorer 2260 he was working on. I replied and offered  my services for
graphics, joined the mail list and while it developed I became the sort of
second in command.<BR>
<B>George</B> I think it was January / February of this year when I contacted 
him
about a few networking / engine options.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> I got interested in that and we got talking.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> Then Chris introduced me into George and we eventually decided
to join together to form World foundry.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> That first mail to Chris was way back in Oct 96.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> We get along very well considering we cover nearly a quarter of 
the
globe and we are out of contact half the day :)  Mostly we share expertise and
ideas and tend to be good at hammering out things....<P>

<B><I>Why the name World Foundry?  Any reason behind 
it?</I></B><BR>
<B>George</B> We would like to think that our games have more depth than 
the
average offering.<BR>
<B>George</B> Thus, it almost has a 'world of its own'.<BR>
<B>George</B> :-)  The name fell into place shortly after.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> And we have created a universe of our own.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> Making worlds.<BR>
<B>George</B> Yep :-).<P>

<B><I>You have pretty much committed yourself to Vulcan at a very early 
stage.
What were the reasons for this?</B></I><BR>
<B>Chris</B> We get on well with Vulcan. They have quite a good developer 
support
mechanism compared to other houses.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> Wide distribution.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> And Paul is so damn enthusiastic about everything :)<BR>
<B>George</B> Vulcan - we like them, they are prepared to support us fully 
with
the PPC option.  Shame about AI's lack of news this weekend...<BR>
<B>Ed</B> And good experience in publishing games.<BR>
<B>Dave</B> Yeah, AI were kinda disappointing.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> KINDA???<BR>
<B>George</B> Yep - AI had pretty much promised specs and the whole 9 
yards.  I'm
pretty much pissed about the lack of info.<P>

<B><I>While on the subject of AI.  What do you think they have to do to get 
the
Amiga back again?</I></B><BR>
<B>Ed</B> Sticking with 68K processors will be a major disaster.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> Go with PPC. Really only logical choice I feel.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> Apart from wake up and realise that the 68K is so dead you could 
use
it as wormfodder?<BR>
<B>George</B> Faith cannot keep us going forever, this weekend was supposed 
to be
*hard* info, not more reteric.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> The use of Phase 5 PPC boards till a PPC OS 4 with 68K
emulation would be the best thing to do.<BR>
<B>Dave</B> People are still living on promises and that just ain't right.<BR>
<B>George</B> My opinion: PPC, PCI/AGP based Hardware, Full Amiga OS 4.0 
[PPC
native], based specs inline with Macs and PC's.<BR>
<B>George</B> Make a package fully out of the box - Amigas still do not come
standard with CD-ROMs.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> That would level the playing field and reduce the base 
price.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> The same migration that Macs did from 68Ks.<BR>
<B>George</B> After this of course, we will need *marketing*, and AI will have
to convince SW houses to come back to the Amiga, this may require money.<BR>
<B>George</B> This will take a lot of work and time, and they should have 
started
yesterday.<BR>
<B>George</B> Sorry - I've got a strong view on this, even more opportunity's
seem to be slipping away as time goes on.<BR>
<B>George</B> :-) OK - after being bombarded by us, next question?<BR>
<B>Chris </B>:) Ok, I'll stop now :)<BR>
<B>George </B>:-)<BR>
<P>

<B><I>You are very Pro CD-ROM/PPC, do you not think you are taking a chance 
by
developing your games with this primarily in mind?</I></B><BR>
<B>Chris</B> Yes. But you never get rewards if you don't take risks. Maybe AI
could try taking some.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> We need games thar can compete with PC games. So fast
processors and CDs are needed.<P>

<B><I>Time for some talk about the games themselves.  For the people that 
don't
know,  what is Explorer 2260?  And the same for Maim & Mangle while we're at
it.</I></B><BR>
<B>George</B> M&amp;M is going to be *the* real-time strategy wargame for 
the Amiga,
specifically focusing on the war aspect, with very little resource management
[unlike other excellent games like Foundation].<BR>
<B>Chris</B> Explorer2260 is a deep space trading, exploration simulation 
based in
a dynamic galaxy which changes around the player as the game progresses.
Everything from political maneuvering to full scale wars can occur. The player
can also undertake deepspace exploration outside known space.. and there will be
a lot more outside there than rocks!<BR>
<B>George</B> ..More.. It will be a fun game in the style of Dune 2, or C&C,
something which Red Alert seems to have forgotten.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> Also the player can undertake mining, trading, military service,
corporate contracts, can advertise on the futuristic internet, StarNET, and
much much much more :).<BR>
<B>Chris</B> Oh, and you can own everything from a one man dingy up to a 
quarter of
a million pop space station.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> That seems to have explained things.<P>

<B><I>The current features list if Explorer and to an Extent Main & Mangle are
very big.  There have been comments on the newsgroups that they will never be
finished.  What do you have to say in reply to this? </I></B><BR>
<B>Ed</B> Oh risky question Dave. :)<BR>
<B>Ed</B> They will be done.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> or Death (Terry Pratchett's Discworld) would say THEY WILL BE 
DONE.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> :) Everyone has a right to their own opinion. We believe that they
are not only possible but achievable.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> We wouldn't have set out without knowing this could be 
done.<BR>
<B>George</B> That is something that is valid.  My primary concern now is 
making
everything fit in.  I have scaled back the online library aspect and the R&D
aspect may be scaled back a bit.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> Much of Explorer has been designed completely and just needs 
full
coding.<BR>
<B>George</B> The key is we are taking them one step at a time, from the
foundation up ;-)<BR>
<B>Ed</B> Amiga owners haven't been used to games of this scale so they
naturally don't  believe they could happen.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> And we think on the same wavelength; something very helpful for 
this
sort of thing.<BR>
<B>George</B> It will take more time than other games, given their scope and 
our
small status.  They will be finished eventually, just a matter of time.<P>

<B><I>So there will be a stage where you say, right, no more new
features?</I></B><BR>
<B>Chris</B> Indeed. I have already reached that stage in much of Explorer. 
What
is going on now is just refining of ideas.<BR>
<B>George</B> Oh definitely - that has already happened with M&amp;M in 
my situation.
 Unless it is small / or a very useful feature, it won't be considered.  The
mailing list has been a great source of ideas, but is possible to go overboard
at times.<BR>
<B>George</B> I've already turned down several suggestions, just because the
thing has to be finished.<BR>
<B>George</B> It's too easy to fall into 'Analysis Paralysis'.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> Like the recent 'pseudo-science' discussion on exp2260. None of 
that
has even been considered as it is too far out.<BR>
<B>George</B> Yep - and mostly off topic for a game.  Despite the personal 
hopes
of some people on the lists, they are only games [entertainment] after all.<P>

<B><I>Will there be any patches etc that you release after the games release
adding extra features etc?</I></B><BR>
<B>Chris</B> Most probably. We have already discussed patched which could 
be used
to refine the universe to keep old version in line with future revisions.<BR>
<B>George</B> Yep - hopefully we will be able to make these freely available 
via
the web. This is of course subject to Vulcan's approval.<P>

<B><I>Regarding the games coding, how much is actually done for both of
them?</I></B><BR>
<B>George</B> Officially we can't go into specifics of the coding.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> We can't tell you I'm afraid. Not allowed to give out progress 
under
terms of the contract.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> Sorry about that.<BR>
<B>George</B> I'm currently testing out my network knowledge ;-).<P>

<B><I>For Explorer, do you see Phoenix as being a big competitor to
Explorer?</I></B><BR>
<B>Chris</B> Well, Phoenix isn't really the same sort of thing.....<BR>
<B>George</B> To add to that, I personally think that Explorer and Phoenix can
happily co-exist.  Phoenix seems to be aimed more at the WC style of things, and
Explorer is more Frontier / Elite styled...<BR>
<B>Ed</B> I don't think so. Phoenix is more of a privateer game.
Linear story and limited places  and things to do in comparison.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> More like WC 3 or 4 style of game.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> Despite some personal disagreements we had initially we tend to
avoid commenting on each (Phoenix and Explorer) other now.<BR>
<B>George</B> They really are not after the same market.  Most people could 
buy
both and be very happy about the choice - they cater to different styles of
games players.<BR>
<B>Dave</B> Mr. Henn wasn't so kind about the game to start off with 
;)<BR>
<B>Chris</B> To say the least.<BR>
<B>Ed</B> He eventually changed his mind. and has used the likes of us in
some of his newsgroups discussions to support his theories.<BR>
<B>George</B> Not really - we are on good terms with them now.  I have even 
seen
Mr. Henn use our games as support in debates on usenet with people ;-)<P>

<B><I>Are the any features in the games that you are particularly proud of or
think will be really good?</I></B><BR>
<B>George</B> Yes - I'm hoping the 3D terrain, coupled with the Line of Sight
and Line of Fire stuff will be well received.<BR>
<B>George</B> Also, the nighttime combat will be pretty neat as well.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> I think that the DUM and StarNET will stand out in 
Explorer.<BR>
<B>Chris</B> Anyway, I really have to go I'm afraid. Time run out here 
:(<BR>
<B>Chris</B>Any last things?<BR>
<B>Dave</B> One more question..<BR>
<B>Dave</B> When will they be released? :P<BR>
<B>Chris</B> :P Won't tell ya :)<BR>
<B>George</B> :-P?  Official - they will be released when they are 
finished....<P>

<HR WIDTH="200"><P>

Right, thats the end of the interview, there will probably be another part in a
couple of weeks looking at each game in more detail.  If there are any questions
that you would like me to put to them then just email them to me and I'll
see what I can do.
