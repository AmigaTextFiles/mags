Massimo,

Thanks for your mail. I try to answer as best as possible, but at the
time being the things are moving fast. On some issues we are just in
the middle of negotiations, so I can't tell you anything definitely.
But, you can use my answers for posting.

Unfortunately some of your questions I can't answer, but I forwarded
it to Andy Finkel. He knows best.

regards,

Stefan Domeyer

First and foremost: will PIOS license AmigaOS from VIScorp/AT or, at
least, define a common API (together with VIScorp) for its new OS?

<R><B> SD <N>

YES, we are in talks with VISCORP to get the license. But please
remember, its not only a porting job. There is a lot to do to bring
the OS in a state of the art condition, and PPC offers many
possibilities in addition.

<R><B> MT <N>

Is there any relation between PIOS and ProDAD's p-OS project?
Anyhow, could p-OS become PIOS' operating system if VIScorp refuses
to license the real AmigaOS?

<R><B> SD <N>

We didn't look into the prodad project yet. But we will.

<R><B> MT <N>

In the case you don't use neither AmigaOS nor p-OS, will your new OS
be compatible with AmigaOS at the API level? I mean, the same
library names, function names and parameters, and so on.
This would greatly ease the transition for current Amiga developers.

<R><B> AF <N>

At this time we have every intention of licensing the AmigaOS for our
project. So we will be compatible on the API level. The PowerPC does have a
different architecture, however. When running in 68K emulation mode, there
will be register compatibility. However, this doesn't make much sense in
native mode;  RISC processors need lots of registers for efficient code.
In native PowerPC mode we will probably adopt the Motorola standard for
argument passing. Only in emulation mode will the exact registers be kept
for library calls. This will be transparent to the application software
writer (who writes in C, anyway) as that can be handled on the
pragma/prototype level.

<R><B> MT <N>

I think it's very important to have an API compatible to the AmigaOS
one; this way, existing Amiga programs could be ported to your platform
simply by recompiling them.

In one of your postings you mentioned the possibility of a PIOS
machine already in 1996 with a Walker-like case but with a PowerPC
CPU. Which operating system will this machine use?

<R><B> SD <N>

Most probably it will use the Mac OS 7.5.X plus a new Amiga emulation
which will run the Amiga OS 3.1. To create the best performance and
compatibility, we will add some typical Amiga Hardware to that
machine.

<R><B> MT <N>

Once you have a working PPC Amiga-like OS available, will your machines
continue to be released with Mac OS, or is this just a temporary
arrangement?
I wouldn't mind if your machines were to run <B>also<N> Mac OS, but I would
prefer to have the new Amiga-like OS as the primary OS...

<R><B> SD <N>

At the time being MacOS is the only relevant solution to run a PPC.
BUT: the most important step will be to enter the CHRP (PPCP)
compliant level. Then PIOS will deliver with the actual available
native OS. If we are faster with the HW than OS, it has to be MacOS
again, but its a question of (short) time to deliver the native Amiga
OS 4.

<R><B> MT <N>

Do you have any idea as to what will be (roughly) the speed of
the emulation of AmigaOS 3.1 on this machine? Same as 030/25? 040/25?
040/40?

<R><B> SD <N>

Its still in the lab for test and measurement. Sorry. Remember: it
also depends on the CPU speed! Wait for announcement.

<R><B> MT <N>

Is the above machine the real AT Walker, licensed by PIOS, or a
completely new PIOS project that just happens to have a similar
look?

<R><B> SD <N>

The "real" AT walker was done by me, Ronnie Coates and Mazet. We have
this team working in PIOS. We will not produce a Walker with a 68030
CPU, because we are a Power PC Company. Most probably we will use the
Walker case design as a extended Tower for the first PIOS developer
machine. In limited edition during Q4, it will contain a high end
CHRP compliant board.

<R><B> MT <N>

Will PIOS long-term cooperate with VIScorp? If you already tried to
do so, have your efforts been successful?

<R><B> SD <N>

We find it very nice to work with VISCORP. These people have the
right track for Amiga, but they will concentrate on their core
business, the ED. We have a big common interest.

<R><B> MT <N>

Will PIOS long-term cooperate with Phase 5? If you already tried to
do so, have your efforts been successful?

<R><B> SD <N>

Only cooperation is long term coop. But its not finalized yet. Heavy
technology discussions.

We try so, as I tried before with AT. Its a pity, that my former
colleague at AT didn't respect the potential of Phase 5, but we do.
They have a good concept for a high end Amiga-like machine. My only
concern is, that this doesn't help the broad basic consumer market.
Remember: about 90% of all Amigas went under DEM 1000.
PIOS wants to keep the Amiga identity, but for production cost
reasons we are always looking for potential in off-the-shelf
components as well.

<R><B> MT <N>

I think you're right. However, I also think PIOS should at least make
sure their machines and Phase 5's ones are compatible at the OS level.
This shouldn't be too difficult, especially if the specs for the OS
would come directly from VIScorp/AT.

<R><B> SD <N>

Why do you expect VIScorp to define the specs? I guess this is our
task. In OS project, Andy is to work closely with Carl Sassenrath.

<R><B> MT <N>

Is it correct to define your future PPC-based machines as
"Amiga-clones"? If not, what will you call them?

<R><B> SD <N>

NO !!! Clone would mean, that there still exists an original Amiga.
What should that be? We don't do a clone of the A 1200 or A 4000!
We do what Amiga Tech should have done by time. The machines will be
branded as PIOS!


<R><B> MT <N>

Well, indeed we all hope there still exists one.

<R><B> SD <N>

If you mean Amiga by Amiga Technologies, you shouldn't wait for that.
I don't think Petro has any idea for a modern computer.

<R><B> MT <N>

So won't you try to obtain a license to use the name AMIGA in some
form? For example, to have a label that says "AMIGA compatible"... this
would allow your machines to have a greater recognition, at least in
the beginning (I think).

<R><B> SD <N>

Good and feasible idea.

<R><B> MT <N>

By the way, what does the acronym "PIOS" stand for?

<R><B> SD <N>

PowerPC Information and Online Systems

<R><B> MT <N>

Can you already give us some specs on the hardware of these machines?

<R><B> SD <N>

No, its under NDA. We will announce the specs at the right time very
soon.

<R><B> MT <N>

Does PIOS already have the necessary funds and resources to
accomplish all of its projects within the announced time frame?

<R><B> SD <N>

Yes. But the best fund is that some people buy our intermediate PPC
solutions. The will be at good price and highest quality standard. We
are a company, we need to make sales; and our dealers need to, also.
