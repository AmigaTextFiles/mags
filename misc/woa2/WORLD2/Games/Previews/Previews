Game Previews

There are a few games coming out soon, the one which most people are 
waiting for with baited breath is, the one, the only, Napalm. This is
something I was supposed to get for Christmas, but it isn't out yet,
suffice to say, it should be out by the time you read this. Anyway,
amongst all the hype which Napalm is receiving, there are actually
more games coming out soon than you might think.

The first of which is Wasted Dreams. The Vulcan website says that
it is on hold now, which is annoying since I have pre-ordered it and
might not be able to get any money back. But you'll all have heard
of this aswell. This section is devoted to the games which no-one has
heard of so far.

Of course, if we had any details of new games, then we would give them
to you, but we don't, so you'll have to send them in, or wait for next
issue when we will have pestered some game maker type people and we
should have some information.

If you have details of a game you are making either commercially or
otherwise, then please send us a demo copy and we'll feature you here.

Just to keep your appetite whetted, we've included some screenshots of
some games that should be coming out soon.

Neil.
