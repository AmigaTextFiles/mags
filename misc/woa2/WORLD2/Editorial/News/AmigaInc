[1mAn Open Letter to the Amiga Community - January 1998

Amiga has always had certain strengths that have never been matched by any 
other operating system. It's small, efficient, and multimedia-centric. As 
Allan Havemose as often said, "We just did it right." Even today the Amiga 
can outperform and outrun today's dominant operating system. 

There has been a great deal of excitement and concern over the last few 
weeks about the future for the Amiga. With the recent announcement in 
Germany of our OS partner QNX and the demonstration of what this package 
can do, we began speeding forward to the future.

When Amiga Inc. was formed our goal was to determine the best road for 
Amiga to take. We wanted to:

 · Continue the current development path and create another version of the 
     operating system.
 · Build a new team from scratch and re-write the OS with the new features 
     necessary to be competitive.
 · Locate an operating system with the same ideals and spirit that the 
     Amiga has. 


We joined in a partnership with QNX to create the NG Amiga. But that didn't 
mean that we intended to forget about the classic system users and the 
faithful Amiga community. We're going to continue working on getting 3.5 
out the door, but we also need to get started working on the new operating 
system. 

We are committed to a long and exciting future for the Amiga, and the 
community that has kept this magnificent architecture alive.

Amiga 3.5 is a work in progress; it has NOT been abandoned. We learned 
over the last several weeks, that what we believed we were getting from 
our partners in the project was not always what they understood they were 
to deliver. So we are going back to each and every partner in the 3.5 
project to make sure that what they are working on is what our customers 
require. It is critical that we deliver what we promised--a complete 
package.

Some of you have been concerned about the future of Amiga and our 
commitment to our developers and the community. Please know that your 
questions and e-mails have not been ignored. We are working very hard 
to complete the final phases of 3.5 and get the developer programs and 
final specifications worked out with our partner QNX. We want to deliver
the most robust and exciting operating system ever. We will do it.

Thanks for your patience and support. The Amiga is on the right path, and 
we look forward to delivering both 3.5 and the NG Amiga soon.

Keep the faith. We're close.
