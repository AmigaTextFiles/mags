[1mGet StrICQ

StrICQ is the Amigas Best ICQ program. For those of you who don't have
a clue about what ICQ is, let me explain. ICQ (I Seek You) is a standard
developed by Mirabilis. Although they don't have an Amiga version of
their own ICQ client, that hasn't stopped Amiga people making their
own, the best of which being StrICQ.

On the PC version of ICQ, you get to register and get your own personal
ICQ number on line, through the actual ICQ program. StrICQ is the only
Amiga version to allow this.

Once you have your ICQ number, write it down and keep it safe. Then,
you can go online. Start up StrICQ and you can then tell it to look
for certain ICQ numbers. If the people who have these numbers are
online, then you can send them messages and even chat with them
using the ICQ client!

It's all very amazing, and I suggest everyone who's on line goes and
get's StrICQ.

My ICQ is 27873010
