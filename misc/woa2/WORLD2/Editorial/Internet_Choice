Internet Choice

This issue's internet drawer contains two regular articles. Internet
choice, this one, and internet trashcan, detailing the crappest sites
around the web. The IC (Internet Choice) article details all the
best sites and this issue, we have two:

http://www.trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk
   I've re-written this bit twice now because I keep on updating the
   page. Now I think I've got a good layout, it uses frames, and it's
   easy to update. I can't really rate it because I'd give it ten
   out of ten (oops, just rated it :), but anyway, go visit it
   sometime.

http://welcome.to/alpha-software
   The Alpha Software website contains two useful things. First, and
   foremost, the Gloom 4 Zombie Massacre pages. There's a nice big
   quote by me at the top of one of the pages which you'll have
   seen if you read magazine adverts from Epic. The second useful
   thing is a Dawn Of The Dead 'fan' page which gives some interesting
   info and opinions. There's also a long piece from the author of
   the site himself, Gareth Murfin. See his articles in the 'Alpha'
   directory this issue.   9/10

http://www.minet.uni-jena.de/~shybyte/hangman/hangmaneng.cgi
   Ever fancied hanging Bill Gates? Here's when you get to do just that!
   Play the standard game of hangman and when you enter a letter which
   is not in the answer, a piece of bill gates appears. Ahhhh, Bliss :)
   A bit slow, but that can only be expected of CGI scripts.   7/10

   Aminet is the Worlds Largest Collection of Amiga Software. Probably the
   worlds largest collection of freely distributable software for any
   platform actually. Go see what you can find on it :) The interface
   is a bit dated. 9/10

   Sam (the PD Editor) has an organisation called Ami-gerbil Software.
   You may have heard of it. However, whether you have or not, you
   should go and visit his site for humour, downloads and loads of
   other stuff. 8/10
