[1mBill Gates Jokes

[1mMicrosoft vs. General Motors

Bill Gates wanted to look good and impress everyone with his success. He 
decided to measure the accomplishments of Microsoft against General Motors.

The comparison went like this:
If automotive technology had kept pace with computer technology over the 
past few decades, you would now be driving a V-32 instead of a V-8, and it 
would have a top speed of 10,000 miles per hour. (160,000km/hr)

Or you could have an economy car that weighs 30 pounds (14 kilos) and gets a
thousand miles to a gallon of gas. In either case the sticker price of a 
new car would be less than $50. 

In response to all this goading, GM responds: 
"Yes, but would you really want to drive a car that crashes four times a 
day?"

[1mHi-Tech Communications

Jerry Sanders, Andy Grove, and Bill Gates (CEOs of AMD, Intel,
and Microsoft, in case you didn't recognize one (or more?) of the names)
were in a  high-powered business meeting.  During the serious, tense
discussions, a  beeping noise suddenly is emitted from where Jerry is
sitting.

Jerry says, "Oh, that's my emergency beeper.  Gentlemen, excuse me, I
really  need to take this call."  So Jerry lifts his wristwatch to his
ear and begins  talking into the end of his tie.  After completing this
call, he notices the others are staring at him.

Jerry explains, "Oh, this is my new emergency communication system.  I
have an  earpiece built into my watch and a microphone sewn into the
end of my tie.  That way, I can a take a call anywhere."

The others nod, and the meeting continues.

Five minutes later, the discussion is again interrupted when Andy
starts beeping.  He also states, "Oh, that is my emergency beeper.
Excuse me, gentlemen, this must be an important call."  So Andy taps
his earlobe and begins talking into thin air.

When he completes his call, he notices the others staring at him and
explains,  "I also have an emergency communication system.  But my
earpiece is actually  implanted in my earlobe, and the microphone is
actually embedded in this fake tooth. Isn't that neat?"

The others nod, and the meeting continues.

Five minutes later, the discussion is again interrupted when Bill
emits a  thunderous fart.  He looks up at the others staring at him
and says, "Uhh, somebody get me a piece of paper... I'm receiving a
fax."

Instructions for Microsoft's New TV Dinner Product

You must first remove the plastic cover. By doing so you agree to accept 
and honor Microsoft rights to all TV dinners. You may not give anyone else 
a bite of your dinner (which would constitute an infringement of Microsoft's
rights). You may, however, let others smell and look at your dinner and are 
encouraged to tell them how good it is.

If you have a PC microwave oven, insert the dinner into the oven. Set the 
oven using these keystrokes:
    "\mstv.dinn.//08.5min@50%heat//"

Then enter:
     "ms//start.cook_dindin/yummy\|/yum~yum:-)gohot#cookme"

If you have an Amiga oven, insert the dinner and press start. The oven will 
set itself and cook the dinner.

If you have a Unix oven, insert the dinner, enter the ingredients of the 
dinner (found on the package label), the weight of the dinner, and the 
desired level of cooking and press start. The oven will calculate the time
and heat and cook the diner exactly to your specification.

Be forewarned that Microsoft dinners may crash, in which case your oven 
must be restarted.  This is a simple procedure.  Remove the dinner from the 
oven and enter:
    "ms.worthless.nogood:=(tryagain\again/again.bozo"

This process may have to be repeated. Try unplugging the microwave and then 
doing a cold reboot. If this doesn't work, contact your hardware vendor.

Many users have reported that the dinner tray is far too big, larger than 
the dinner itself, having many useless compartments, most of which are 
empty.  These are for future menu items. If the tray is too large to fit 
in your oven, you will need to upgrade your equipment.

Dinners are only available from registered outlets, and only the chicken 
variety is currently produced. If you want another variety, call Microsoft 
Help and they will explain that you really don't want another variety. 
Microsoft Chicken is all you really need. 

Microsoft has disclosed plans to discontinue all smaller versions of their
chicken dinners. Future releases will only be in the larger family size. 
Excess chicken may be stored for future use, but must be saved only in 
Microsoft approved packaging.

Microsoft promises a dessert with every dinner after '98. However, that 
version has yet to be released. Users have permission to get thrilled in 
advance.

Microsoft dinners may be incompatible with other dinners in the freezer, 
causing your freezer to self-defrost. This is a feature, not a bug. Your 
freezer probably should have been defrosted anyway.
