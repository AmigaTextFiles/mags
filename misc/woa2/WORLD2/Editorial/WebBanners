[1mFree Advert Banners

You'll probably have noticed, when you visit our webpage, that we have
joined up with two different advertising type organisations which
exist on the Internet. They allow you to make a banner and circulate
it for you on other peoples websites as long as you also include 
some special banner code on your website.

On the main trogsoft page, you'll see an Amiga Web Network banner.
(www.amicrawler.com/banners). This is an Amiga only banner exchange
service which I recommend you join. It's already got people like
Omnipresence, and the Cu Amiga website also joined up (you know,
the CU website still exists, and I think you can get back issues
from it still).

On the main WOA page (www.trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk/woa.htm), you will
see an EIS banner swap banner which isn't Amiga only, but accepts
many types of banner and has many more than the Amiga Web Network
because they are of a wider type.

Anyway, go to our website, and click on the links which appear below the
banners to go to the banner sites and you too can advertise your
site on the internet!
