There are several different email addresses you need to remember. If you
want to contact Trogladite Software about their products, then Email

and put the name of the product or thing you want information about in
the subject. This is also where all press related things should go to.

woa@trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk

and put 'Articles', 'Contribution', 'Letters', 'Technical', 'Internet
Choice', 'Internet Trash' or 'General' in the subject depending on
what you are emailing us about. To get in touch with the editor of
WOA (Neil Bullock), Email:

and leave the subject blank. This address also accepts stuff to do with
WOA, as long as you put 'WOA' in the subject. Finally, to contact
Antony about games things (IE, requesting a game cheat, or sending him
a letter), then send emails to:
