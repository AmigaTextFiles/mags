[1mDiskmag Reviewers

If you are sat there with loads of different diskmags on your hard disk
and you have just finished reading them, but can't figure out why there
aren't many new products reviewed in them, then you ought to remember
that many diskmag reviewers, and editors, make no money from the diskmag
and very few of the editors/reviewers will be able, or willing, to
fork out their own money to buy review products.

This means that some will review beta test versions (only if the
reviewer is a beta tester for a certain product), which doesn't usually
reflect what the full product will have in it.

However, after christmas, the next issue of diskmag's may include lots
of new product reviews, and this is for the obvious reason that
Christmas has just finished and the editors/reviewers asked for some
Amiga stuff for christmas and reviewed it, which is generally what
I do, and it's also why we have the Power Flyer, Amiga ClassiX and
Zombie Massacre reviews, which are all fairly new products, indeed
many other mags, and diskmags, don't have the Amiga ClassiX, or 
Zombie Massacre review!

So, the next time you will get some new products reviewed will be in
the June issue because my Birthday is in May, you see :)
