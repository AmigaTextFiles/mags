Happy Birthday

It's February now (well, actually, it's December now, but you'll be
reading in February) and in Feb 1995, we started up Trogladite Software
which makes it 4 years old! And I thought you might like to see a
brief history of Trogladite Software, and everything we've done.

Early on, we started off and I started with the name 'NBA Productions'
which was simply a name to put at the start of our products. After
making, but never finishing, some products, I changed the name to
Trogladite Software and started making the diskmag.

Here is a list of all our output so far:

   
    First of all, we had a number of games which we made and were
   crap. One was called Attack and the other was a shite colonisation
   clone

    We started off with Amiga Beginner as our Diskmag but it was
   soon scrapped after F1 Licenceware refused it several times.

    After that, we released World Of Amiga, which took from 1996 to
   get completed and then my hard disk broke, and again, and again!
   Unlucky, or what. At last, it's released.

    We now have UCM being made and that's our main project after
   the diskmag, so expect to see it fairly soon.


And there you have it. This is much less than Gaz Murfin wrote, but that's
because I have already written this, but it went on my last hard disk :(
