Diary of Amiga Events for Gareth Murfin starting in late 1996...

Gloom 3 in the public eye...

In early June 1997 after playing and completing Gloom Deluxe and realising
that   it was probably my favourite game of all time I began to create my
own personal version of Gloom for use by myself and brothers. It began to
look quite promising so I sent it to numerous publishers before Guildhall
Leisure took an interest. The story of Gloom 3 begins....

Signed a contract with Guildhall Leisure and Epic Marketing to produce
Gloom 3 - Zombie Edition as a commercial game to be sold in HMV, Game and
Electronics Boutique. Release date December 1997 at £14.99 on Amiga CD
& CD³².

Gloom 3 Zombie Edition was officially changed to Ultimate Gloom & it was
decided that the 2 older versions of Gloom would be put on the same CD.
Gloom 3 and my name were mentioned in Cu Amiga's news pages in an article
about   new games on page 16 of the September 97 issue. The same was also on the
September 97 version of the Cu Amiga Website. Gloom 3 and its new features
were discussed on the CU Amiga mailing list in mid August 97. Gloom3 was
mentioned twice in an article by Andrew Korn (Cu Staff writer), in large
writing next to a big picture of Worms 2 it said "Products are coming,
games like Myst, OnEscapee and Gloom 3 have the potential to get people
excited again" (Nov97)

Gloom 3 Demo v1.1 was featured as the 'big commercial give away!' on Amy
Resource
CD 5 the Anniversary issue to celebrate its First Birthday (Sept97) I was
sent the CD for free (£20). Gloom3 was mentioned on the back of the CD box.
Gloom3 Demo v1.0 was added to the official Gloom Web pages to download in
Sept 97. Gloom3 'AmiNet release' was the 13th most downloaded file of
August 1997 and voted the 14th best file of that month on the AmiNet.
Gloom 3 demo featured on CUCD 17 with a special Gloom icon, some files had
been removed and the demo didnt work.

Gloom 3 Ze preview and details featured on the Amiga Nutta website in the
news and also the previews section. These was a link to my homepage too.
Sept1997. Gloom 3 Ze previewed in a half page preview in Amiga Format Oct
97 Issue 102 on Page 34 with pictures and text as part of a preview section.
Also mentioned with   pictures on p33.

Ultimate Gloom was officially changed to Gloom 3 "Ultimate Gloom".

Ultimate Gloom was finally reviewed in CU Amiga gaining 80%. The review
was quite negative despite the high percentage, the IRC chats and mailing
lists were full of people wondering whether to buy Gloom3 - Ultimate Gloom.

Gloom 3 was pre-bought by All the Electronics Boutique's and Game's
(computer shops) up and down the United Kingdom. It hit the shops around
Christmas week 1997 and I began receiving eMails from satisfied customers
all over the UK and some as far a field as US and Amsterdam! Gloom 3 was
distributed world wideby over 15 different Amiga companies and reviewed by
all Amiga magazines worldwide.

Adverts for Gloom 3 "Ultimate Gloom" were in Cu Amiga and Amiga Format and
other Amiga magazines 4-5 times an issue from October 97 to the present day.
A Gloom 3 Demo was featured on AFCD21 aswell as the Gloom 3 rejects archive.
The Official Gloom 3 website was set up by Me. It has lots of sections about
the game and a downloads section where fans can get related files and new
patches etc. CUCD19 included a directory full of Gloom 3 related files from
the website.

I did an interview with an online magazine called 'The Lair!' who reviewed
a demo of Gloom 3 and previewed some of my up and coming software. This
interview was featured in the online magazine in December 1997 and titled
Dawn of the Gaz" relating to my inspiration for Gloom3 from George Romero's
cult classic 'Dawn of the dead'. It was also featured on CUCD20.
The official 'Amiga Online' magazine previewed Gloom3 on their website.
There was a small preview of Gloom 3 in the February 98 issue of Amiga
Format which said that it would be released in the next few months. Some
older screen shots were used.

Negotiations began with an American Amiga company called 'Amiga Crossing'
to distribute Gloom 3 in Northern America in the Shops, magazines and on
the net. I was shocked at the amount of international interest. Financial
difficulties meant that the deal was dropped.

I finally got my free copies of Ultimate Gloom and began to sit back and spot
faults from a consumers point of view. A patch was immediatly released to
fix bugs which had been discovered by the huge audience of people who bought
Gloom 3. I thought of many things for a sequel, and began to put some ideas
together, Gloom 3 - The Director's Cut was born.

Numerous deals were set up for distribution of Alpha Softwares forth coming
games. Gloom 3 DC is planned for distribution all over the world in many
different computer shops and magazines!

December 1997, got free AmiNet CD22 because the Gloom 3 Demo and rejected
files archive was on the CD-ROM.

February 1998 Cu Amiga Magazine CD19 had a fully working Gloom3 demo on after
numerous complaints from readers (which could be read in the letters section
of the magazine). The demo was mentioned on the CD Box & CD highlights aswell
as in the 'points of view section'. The official Gloom3 patch and loading
instructions aswell as the 'rejects' archive was also included in the same
directory.

My Alpha Software website including the Official Gloom 3 website was included
on AFCD21 and AFCD23.

The latest Gloom 3 patches & texts were on AFCD24. A Gloom 3 level selector
and play in a window program were coded by a Gloom 3 fan and uploaded to
AmiNet and got on AmiNet CD24. A Gloom 3 cheat program created by a fan was
on AFCD26.

A new release of Gloom 3 - "Ultimate Gloom" was released with a slightly
different box, and a sticker to describe why Classic & Deluxe Gloom were not
included despite mentioning them on the box. This 'new' version implied that
it was selling very well. The Gloom 3 help text was included on AmiNet CD23.

Gloom 3 was reviewed by 'WOA' a quality shareware disk magazine, it got 96%
and the verdict was 'Its a brilliant game and I suggest you get it pretty
soon'.

Gloom 3 - The Director's cut, a sequel to Gloom 3 was started. A website was
also set up for it by me. The sales figures for Gloom 3 came in, it was
selling very well, encouraging me to make more.

Gloom 3 - The Director's Cut was mentioned in 'Game News' in CU Amiga April
98 and also the Questions & Answer section.

Gloom 3 - The Director's Cut was officially changed to 'Zombie Massacre' and
Alpha Software signed a deal with Epic Marketing - June 1998.

Gloom 3 gained 44% in a 2 page review in 'Amiga Future' a German Amiga games
mag. A demo was on the CD.
