Alpha Software
Brief History

 - By Gareth Murfin

Alpha Software began life as 'GazSting Enterprises' way back in 1995 and
produced a string of low quality releases ranging from demo's to scripts. 
Over time when Gaz got more aquainted with the AmigaOS and programming 
languages Alpha began to release some pretty competant freeware titles, 
some of which won awards and were included on magazine cover disks etc. 
Alpha then concentrated on releasing a constant stream of freeware which 
was all of a half decent standard. Some of this freeware died of death 
while other stuff really did well. 

Then Alpha moved into doing Commercial software aswell as freeware, and 
produced Ultimate Gloom (aka Gloom 3). This title was published by Guildhall 
Leisure and actually hit the shelves of shops worldwide, quite an 
acheivement for an Amiga title, seeing as titles such as Amiga Myst & Quake 
didn't even hit the shelves!

Magazines worldwide gave Ultimate Gloom a slagging, execept Cu Amiga who 
gave it 80%, a nice score from the then Worlds best selling Amiga magazine. 
Then Alpha produced the final Gloom style game they will ever do - Zombie 
Massacre. Designed to go out with a bang Zombie Massacre was a brilliant 
title, much better than Ultimate Gloom. Zombie Massacre was available 
worldwide too, but never hit the shelves in mainstream UK outlets. 

Right now Alpha Software are working hard on their next two commercial 
releases, The Dead Walk and Tiny Car Racing. And hopefully these next two 
will immortalise Alpha Software in the 'good quality' software hall of fame.
