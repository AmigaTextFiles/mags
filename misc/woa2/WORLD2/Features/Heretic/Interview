Heretic

We interviewed Jesper Svennevid (chip@ramses.ml.org), the creator of one
of the Amiga Heretic ports, and asked him a few questions. Here's
what happened.

WOA> Why did you want to port Heretic to the Amiga? Was it because it was
what people expected, since Doom and such like have also been ported
or was there another reason?

  JS> Well, I thought of it as good practice, mostly, and porting code
  mostly is fun :)

WOA> Do you intend to keep developing your port of Amiga Heretic?

  JS> Yes, atleast for a while, this is mostly to make a good version of
  the game available for the amiga-market.

WOA> What major problems did you face when porting?

  JS> Well, mostly a compiler problem that costed me 2 days development
  time, as it didn't report any problems during the compile. The game
  itself was rather easily ported. :)

WOA> Do you have any plans for your port? New features or anything like
that?

  JS> I haven't decided that yet actually... I'm just in the process of
  tidying up and optimizing the game core, so I'll have to look further
  into this...

WOA> Are there any major features missing in your port when compared to
the PC version?

  JS> Mostly TCP/IP-netowrking. This will be implemented as soon as
  possible though.

WOA> Thanks
