[1mRealPlayer

This is a newish thing on the PC meant for playing RealMedia files from
the Internet. You can, of course, play the files if you have them on
your hard disk, but it is mainly meant for Internet files. These
RealMedia files can include Sound, Pictures, Video or a combination of
all three.

Sounds a good idea. But as far as I'm aware, there's no Amiga program
which can play these .rm files. This can be considered annoying as
many websites are getting rid of WAV files and the like and replacing
them with RealMedia files.

This could prove troublesome for Amigans wanting to view the latest
music videos and hear the latest music files. However, I forsee two
possibilites. First, all Amigans could get a PC emulator and run
RealPlayer through that. This probably wouldn't work because, as far
as I know, RealPlayer is Win95+ only. Second, someone out there could
port RealPlayer to the Amiga.

Since RealMedia make no money (as far as I can see) from RealPlayer,
I don't see the problem in them releasing it's source and the info
about how RealMedia files are stored to the general public.

The only problems I have found with RealPlayer are the fact that it
is based around the Internet. This means that if you decide you want
to look at someones website while listening to a song using RealPlayer,
then RP would probably need to stop playing and rebuffer the song so
it could play from memory and take information in advance.

The second problem is the quality and speed of the video. Even on these
highly overpowered processors that you get on the PC, the video speed/
quality ratio leaves a lot to be desired. I have included various
screenshots. The first, "RealPlayer1" shows the basic layout of the
window with a double sized video clip.

There are 3 modes of operation. Without video, with normal or double
sized video, or full screen video. With no video, you get a simple window
with just the black info box at the bottom and the other buttons.
Some of the video clips you can find on the internet leave a lot to
be desired. While they are fully animated, they look awful. Take my
'RealPlayer3' screenshot, which is actually all you get when you play
video at full screen.

The video, if you can't tell, is C'est La Vie by B*Witched, but you'd
be hard pushed to make anything in the clip out at all! Try the
RealPlayer2 screenshot which shows double size video, which is very
good quality, and you can easily make out that it is The Corrs and
the 'What Can I Do' video (Brilliant song!).

The final screenshot (RealAmiga) shows what I think the Amiga port
would look like. It took bloody ages to draw, especially as I already
have a headache and I had to draw it in bloody interlaced mode :(

But I wish someone would just hurry up and port the program to Amiga
so we can take advantage of the new Video and Sound format.

[1mUpdate!
Well, those resourceful Amigan people have done it again. No sooner
have I spent hours researching this article, then someone brings out
a tool to play realaudio on the Amiga. This article still applies with
video, and the Amiga version of the audio player is buggy.
