	I know you might think I am strange, but I am not completely against 
piracy, unless it is Amiga software being pirated then I am against it. 
What I mean is that I do not think pirating things like Windoze, or other 
products from companies of a sufficient size, is wrong. I say this as 
Microsoft is seriously ripping people off, and normal people do not know 
any better. What really gets me is that Microsoft charge several hundred 
pounds for software. A few weeks back, when I was reading one of my many 
PC magazines, I came across a company that specialises in PC software. I 
was browsing through it to see what the latest software was, and an 
advertisement for Visual C/C++ 6 (Or whatever the latest one is) caught my 
eye. I was reading through it, as I am looking for a good C/C++ compiler 
for my other machine, and then the price hit me - about £750! I was 
shocked. How can they get away with charging £750 for a C/C++ compiler, 
an editor, a few libraries and a header file or two? It is not only PC 
software; A few years back I saw a review of either Imagine or Lightwave 
5 in Amiga Format. I looked at the price and saw that it was over one and 
a half thousand pounds! I think that there should be a limit to the price 
of software, something like a maximum of around £100. 

	Back to the theme of piracy. The reason that I say it is not right to 
pirate Amiga software, is that pirating Amiga software is destroying the 
Amiga from within. But on the other hand, I think that it is OK to pirate 
certain PC and console software as there is not much chance of damaging 
Sony or Microsoft. If you pirate Amiga software today then you must not 
really care about the Amiga. Pirating will put off the last few Amiga games 
companies from producing the high standard of games they do today. This 
has already begun to happen; ClickBoom have said they might not produce 
Quake PPC as there have been hacked versions of this around the internet 
and the sales of Quake were not too good. Also there will be no Shadow 
of the Third Moon 2 as the original version was heavily pirated, according 
to its creators.  The thing about pirating things like Windoze `95 or `98 
is that Microsoft are not likely to go bankrupt from losing between £50 
and £100. You might think I am living in an ideal world, as there is not 
much chance of Windoze going for £10 or NT for £30 is there? But I am just 
stating these are the prices that they SHOULD be. I have a feeling that 
I am not the only person that feels this way about Microsoft or software 
prices in general. If you have any comments that are related to this, then 
please E-mail me. My E-mail address is at the bottom.

	I also think that computer games, on all formats, should not exceed 
£20, ecspecially on something like the PlayStation. It is the same as 
Microsoft, how can they justify selling a game for around £40? Their usual 
answer is, "Because the public are willing to pay that much." The only 
reason that the public pays this much is because that is the price, the 
public does not ask for highly priced computer games. Companies like 
Sony would sell a lot more copies of games if they lowered the price 
slightly. Even if they lowered it by £10, they would probably end up 
making more profit. Say if they sold a game for £30 instead of £40; 
take the production cost of the CD and manual ect away, they would still 
have over £28 to share between them and the games developers. They produce 
the games in such high quantities that the actual production cost is in 
pennies rather than pounds. 

	Another thing that has really annoyed me is that Intel are claiming 
that they are not selling enough Pentium processors in the UK as Dixons 
are selling PCs at too higher prices. How can they say that when they 
charge just over £400 for a 450Mhz processor? Intel is set to release a 
500Mhz processor in January or early February 1999, I dread to think how 
much that is going to cost. Dixons then replied by saying that they would 
sell them cheaper, but the high price of the processors keeps the price 
of the PCs up. Intel said that the reason the processors are so high is 
that the research and development costs a lot, and they need to sell the 
processors a high price to cover this cost. Thats a good reason for the 
high processor prices, but they should not go a critisize Dixons. OK, 
Dixons DO rip people off, but not as much as Intel do. I recently worked 
out that quarter of the price of Dixon`s Pentium 2 450Mhz model, was 
actually spent on the processor!

	Here is the type of pricing Dixons use. Dixons are selling a full 
system, with Windoze `98 installed, Word `97 and Encarta included. The 
hardware it has is:

	# Cyrix 300Mhz M2
	# 32Mb RAM
	# 2.1Gig Hard Disk
	# 24X CD ROM
	# 14" SVGA Monitor

	All of the above for a total of £699 - This is their cheapest full 
system with software. They do a version with the same hardware 
specification (Except this one has a 32X CD ROM instead of a 24X), but 
lacks any software - It might have Windoze `98. It comes with a "FREE" 
Olivetti JP 192 printer, all this for a total of £599 - not too bad.

Their most expensive full system has:

	# 450Mhz P2 CPU
	# 128Mb RAM
	# 10Gig HD
	# 4X DVD ROM
	# 56K Modem
	# 17" SVGA Monitor
	# Over 40 software titles

All of the above for a hefty £1761!

	I went to a computer fair in October `98 to build myself a new PC, I 
took £350 and came home with tons of bits`n`bobs to make a fully working PC 
and still had change. You are probably thinking that I have a crappy setup. 
Here it is:

	# Cyrix 233Mhz 
	# 64Mb SD RAM
	# 2.6 Gig HD
	# 36X CD ROM
	# 2nd Hand 14" SVGA Monitor
	# 33.6K Internal (ISA) Modem

	And all the rest of the hardware such a mouse and keyboard. Not bad 
for under £350! This is  just the hardware, which is not much different 
from the one that Dixons are selling, but at half the price! I got things 
like Windoze `95 and Encarta `98 free from my friends. If you think I am 
talking crap, just go to any big, weekly computer fair. They change where 
they are each week usually. Arm yourself with a few quid, or however much 
you can spare and treat your Amiga to loads of new hardware. I got a 2.6Gig 
IDE Quantum FireBall for £80; you can now pick up a 3.2Gig Hard drive for 
around 85-95 quid from magazines, so just think how cheap they will be from 
a computer fair! Just think how pleased your faithful old Miggy will be 
when you give it a 3.2Gig HD to live on.

	You may be asking yourself, "Why the Hell is he buying a PC anyway?" 
Well it is all down to the power:price ratio. If you do not know what this 
is, it is getting the most powerful computer hardware for your money. 
Unfortunately the Amiga has a low power:price ratio, but the PC has a high 
one. Take my budget as an example, I had £350. There were two choices:

	<< 1 >> I could get an Apollo 1260 50Mhz accelerator, 32Mb fast RAM 
             and a Power Flyer.

     << or >>

     << 2 >> I could get a fully working PC running at 233Mhz, 2.6 Gig, 
             64Mb RAM ect

	Do you see what I mean about the power:price ratio? For £350, I could 
give my Amiga a small upgrade or get a reasonably powerful PC. But do not 
think I have deserted the Amiga. I still use my Amiga quite often, I even 
got another Amiga recently and have spent a few hundred pounds on upgrading 
my original Amiga.

	The reason I am telling you this is because people are doing exactly 
what I did, except they desert the Amiga completely. The high prices of 
Amiga hardware are driving Amiga users away. But on the other hand, the 
companies need to keep prices high to continue business, and the Amiga 
specific hardware is more expensive to manufacture as they are not made in 
anywhere near as large quantities that PC or generic hardware is made at. 
I think the price of the accelerators is actually down to Motorola who 
produce the processors and sell them at high prices. Do not think that I 
am having a go at companies like Power Computing and Eyetech, I actually 
applaud companies like these for their continued hard work on keeping the 
Amiga alive. 

                    	       Long live the Amiga!

== NOTE FROM NEIL ==
Since this article contains references to acts of illegality, I must stress 
that the opinions expressed here are not necessarily those of World Of 
Amiga. 

Additionally, console game prices are so high because of the massive fees 
companies have to pay for the privelage of writing a game on the console, 
often in excess of a 45,000 pound lump sum before development has even 
begun!
