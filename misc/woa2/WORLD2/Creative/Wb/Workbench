Workbench Tutorial

Since everyone keeps complaining about the lack of beginners tutorials
for the Amiga, we thought we might as well run one ourselves. And we're
prepared for everyone complaining that you know everything in the
tutorial, because if you're not a beginner, then don't read the tutorial.
It stands to reason! :)

In this first tutorial, we are going to concentrate on files and how
you can manipulate them in the Workbench environment. Files are just
simple (or not so simple) collections of data. They are joined together
as one file. Easy.

Files have icons. The icons are seperate files which the Amiga Workbench
interprets differently to normal files, simply because icons have a
'.info' extension. The icons not only contain the image data, but they
contain all other data which can be held about a file. If a file doesn't
have an icon representing it, then the file can have no information
about it stored and uses a default set of information which is usually
set up by Workbench, but will be covered later.

The way to edit icon information is with the built in Workbench information
editor which is in the Icons menu. This only works if you have selected
an icon on the Workbench screen. 

That is what the main part of this tutorial will cover. The information
requester is fairly simple once you get used to it. Rather than 
covering a select group of people who use Swazinfo (on this issues
Xtra Disk), we will not cover the individual features of Swaz, but
will concentrate purely on the default Workbench info requester.

If you have selected a certain type of icon, then a different info
requester will appear. Disk icons show the disk type requester, drawers,
tools, projects and the trashcan show different types. 

Before I go through each, let me go through what exactly tools and 
projects are. Tools are the actual programs which reside on your system.
Projects are the files generally saved by programs, and these project
files have special information fields called Default Tools in which
you can specify a program to be started when you double click on the
project icon.


> DISK INFORMATION WINDOW


Blocks: Total number of blocks on the disk 

Used: Used number of blocks on the disk

Free: Free number of blocks on the disk

Blocksize: The actual size (in bytes) of each block

Last Changed: Tells you when the disk was last changed

Volume Is: Displays the Read/Write status of the disk


> DRAWER/DIRECTORY INFORMATION WINDOW


Script: Allows the file to be executed without the use of an execute
        command. Create a script file, and usually you have to type
        'Execute <File>' to execute it, but you can just type the 
        name of the file if you set this protection bit. 

Archived: Can be used for some non standard purposes. Just sets the
          files status to show AmigaDOS that it is an archive of files.

Readable: Unset this to make sure people cannot view the contents of this
          directory.

Writable: Unset this to make sure people cannot write to the directory

Executable: Also to do with scripting functions

Deletable: Unset this to make the file protected from deletion

Last Changed: See disk

Comment: Something you can use for reference

Tool Types: Next Issue


> TOOL INFORMATION WINDOW


As Drawer except:

Blocks: Number of blocks on the disk which the file uses

Bytes: Number of bytes on the disk which the file uses

Stack: Amount of memory which should be allocated for the running of the
       program.


> PROJECT INFORMATION WINDOW


As Tool except:

Default Tool: Sets the program which should be run when you double click
              on the project file.



Next issue, we will go through tool types, and some advanced features
of the Workbench.
