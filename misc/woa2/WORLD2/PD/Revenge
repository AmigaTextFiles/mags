Revenge - Armchair Assassin 2 - Mud, Blood `n` Bones Edition.

The basic idea of this game is to massacre as many of the small groups of
pixels whizzing around the screen as possible in as little time as possible.
Simple enough. But there are a lot more additions to this game, so this
game is more fun than it initially sounds or looks.

First of all, there are two gaming modes: Sequential slaughter and Maximum
Mayhem. Sequential slaughter is where there is a certain order to kill the
`victims`, and if you kill a victim prematurely, it will be resurrected on
the spot and carry on as if nothing had happened. The sequence starts at
the top-right of the victims' window. Maximum mayhem is where you can kill
any of the victims in any order you want - if its under your crosshair,
kill it.

When you have killed all of the victims on that area, there is a `Shoot the
Heads` session. The idea of this is to shoot the heads and knock them
around the screen. When you hit a head it just moves in a certain direction
but does not explode. I personally find this little addition a bit boring
and pointless, however there will be few people that will enjoy it. Also,
when you kill a victim, its head will always be looking in the direction
that the mouse pointer is in. And if you move the mouse, it will change
which way it is facing to whichever way the mouse has moved to.

   There is a total ten weapons! Here they are with a description of each
   one (F1-F10):

# Shotgun - A standard pump-action shotgun. It has a medium sized firing
  range (The size of the crater it makes in the ground), so you do not have
  to be too accurate. It is too slow for my liking.

# Arnie-gun - What it means is a mini-gun. This is the fastest firing
  weapon on the game - hold down the LMB and drag the mouse around the
  screen and you will soon slaughter a fair amount of the victims. Good for
  mowing down a row of maimed victims.

# Photon Torpedo - A big ball of light that shoots down from the sky. There
  is about a two-second delay between when you pressed the LMB (fire) and
  it actually hitting the ground. It also follows the mouse when it is
  coming down the screen, if you move the mouse to the left, the torpedo
  will follow it.

# Pulse Laser - Slightly slower than the Arnie-gun, but has a bigger firing
  range than the Arnie-gun. It fires small balls of fire.

# Night Scope - This is my favourite gun. It uses an infrared view
  (Everything goes green). It is not a good weapon if you want to complete
  the area quickly, but it is fun. It has the same firing rate as the
  shotgun, but it is harder to hit victims with this.

# BFB9000 - Same as the Photon Torpedo, except this has a bomb instead of a
  ball of fire.

# Electric Shock Treatment - it is quite humorous when a victim get struck
  by the lightening. However, it is hard to hit people with it, especially
  on a high-speed mode.

# Alien DNA Experiment - turn the victims into mobile green blobs. This
  weapon rarely kills victims, they just walk around and when they come
  into contact with another victim they pass it on to the next victim. It
  does wear off after a few minutes, and sometimes when it wears off, the
  victim dies.

# FireBall - Same as above, except the victim walks around as a fireball

# Air Strike - you select two points, one the start point and the second
  the end point. The air strike will the take place with five evenly spaced
  out bombs hitting the ground and whatever else is in the way. This is not
  recommended for killing the last victim on the area, running around at
  speed five.

There are still more twists. If you get a direct hit on a victim using any
weapon, it will kill it instantly and register as a kill. If however, you
set of a bomb, but it is too far away to kill it yet it is still hit by the
explosion, it will count as a maim. When a victim is maimed, it staggers
in a straight line for about ten to fifteen seconds, leaving a trail of
blood behind it. After ten to fifteen seconds it returns to full health
and carries on as if nothing had happened. When a victims is maimed, if
it gets maimed again it will die instantly.

You can have from four to sixty victims on screen at once, and from one to
eight victims. You can even choose how many of each victim you want as well
as which victims you want to kill. There is a good range of pre-drawn
victims to choose from, including the Spice girls (Including Ginger), Sonic
the Hedgehog, Mario, Saddam Hussein, the Teletubies and my favourite, Bill
Gates.

You can draw your own heads in DPaint, or whatever paint package you use.
They must use the pre-defined, sixteen colour palette and use a lo-res
three hundred and twenty by two hundred and fifty six screen mode. You need
four heads for each victim; one looking left, one looking right, one
looking towards you and one looking away from you - not in that order.
Each head is only sixteen pixel high by sixteen pixels wide. You then load
it into the Victim Editor and choose the colour of its body; there are
about eight colours to choose from. You also select the sounds to play
when it is killed and the speed that the sound sample is played at. When
you have saved this data, you go into the Edit Victims menu in the main
game and select your new victim.

Summary

This is a very good game that has a lot of nice extras. It has good
graphics, reasonable sound and it is brilliantly addictive. A well polished
stress reliever.

You can download heads that I have made, from my web site at
www.ami-gerbil.freeserve.co.uk/revenge_stuff.ZIP and you will need a
program to unzip it, sorry.

Note from the Ed,
We've given you the Amiga version of Zip on our second disk this issue.
