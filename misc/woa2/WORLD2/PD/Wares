[1mWhatever-Ware
[2mBy Samuel Brookes 1999
 
You have all seen it, you have all used it, you have all heard about, and a 
lot of you have probably contributed to the huge archives of it. What am I 
talking about? Shareware, freeware, giftware, charityware ect, is what I am 
talking about. Because at least one person reading this will not know 
exactly what shareware is, I will try to explain it. 

Shareware is usually a cut-down or limited version of a product - a trial 
version. What the author(s) do is they create a version that works, but has 
one or more of the main functions disabled. For example, a company might be 
releasing a paint package and want to give everyone a trial version of this 
program so they can have a play around with it and see how good it is, to 
try and convince the user to buy the full product. But on the other hand 
they don`t want it to be so good that they can just use the demo and not 
need to pay the registration fee. To accomplish this, they would take out 
features like Save, Load and some of the effects if it has any. The user of 
this demo is then meant to think to him/her self, 
"Wow! This is great. I must pay the registration fee so that I can load in 
my own picture and edit them. I will then be able to save the finished 
picture and I will be able to show all my friends how good I am at 
drawing."

The user is meant to so amazed at its capabilities that they immediately go 
and pay the registration fee and get the full product. 

Lots of well-known games and programs have used and proved that this method 
can work. Quake is a good example of this. ID Software released a shareware 
version of Quake around or just before the time it was released. What they 
had done was to create a version of the game that only had the first 
episode, which contained all of the level that are in episode one - I think 
it was about 1/4 of the game! When the player had finally completed all 
the levels in that episode they would try to enter the next episode. But 
when they tried to enter it, they were told by a message on the screen, 
"For registered users only! Play episode one and then call 1-800-IDGAMES". 
Most people who played this were so amazed that they did register, if you 
have ever played Quake you will know why. This is one of the reasons why 
Quake sold so many copies; the other is that it probably got great reviews 
in computer games magazines. The message usually used by shareware authors 
is something along the lines of, "If you like this product, then please pay 
the registration fee and you will get the full version." If the product is 
good then this idea usually works. 

Unfortunately, in the real world, not everyone pays the registration fee. 
If you ask a group of people who do not pay their registration fees, their 
answers will vary. Here is a list of usual reasons why people fail to pay 
the fee: 

<< 1 >> I forgot to.

<< 2 >> I do not have a credit card.

<< 3 >> He lives in Egypt and I do not have any Egyptian money.

<< 4 >> I do not trust other people.

<< 5 >> How do I know that they will send me the full product, they might 
        just keep the money and not send me anything.

<< 6 >> I am only a teenager who is still paying off his parents for running
        up a phone bill of over £100 for spending 75 hours on-line, so I 
        do not have any spare money to spend on my computer.

<< 7 >> I like the demo.

These are only a few of the responses that people could give. Most of the 
above statements are not really valid reasons. Here are some things that 
show that the above reasons are not valid:

   << 1 >> Get a reminder program, tie a knot in a handkerchief, write it 
           on you body somewhere...ect... 

   << 2 >> You don`t need a credit card. Not many shareware programs that 
           are written by a single person or small group let you register 
           by credit card, most of them want cheques. 

   << 3 >> Go down to your bank and change some of you money to Egyptian 
           money, or just send the author an international cheque - I think 
            that's what they are called, well it is something like that.

   << 4 >> Well you will just have to learn to trust people. You trust your   
           bank with your money. You trust that the supermarkets have taken 
           care of your shopping when it was being stored. So why do you not
           trust a normal person?

   << 5 >> Well this is a pretty good reason, and it HAS been done before. 
           Luckily, I do not know of any such incidences happening recently,
           I am not saying it does not still happen though. 

   << 6 >> This is my excuse. The only possible way out, is to get job or 
           get involved in some other hair- brained moneymaking scheme. 
           Create your very own shareware product.

   << 7 >> A stupid answer. How many people like the demo more than the 
           full product? None.

Some of those reasons we can help people with, the others we sadly can not. 

Some people ask the stupid question, "Why should we pay the registration 
fee?" I personally think the answer to this is pretty obvious. First of 
all, people who ask this question are obviously not true Amiga fans. If 
they were true Amiga fans then they would know that the Amiga is here today 
due to all the `Bed-room` programmers who made all the shareware and 
freeware when the Amiga was in serious trouble. Most Amiga experts say that 
if these people did not create all of this great software then the Amiga 
would not be as we know it or even not here! So the answer is, we pay these 
people to continue their excellent work on keeping the Amiga alive. The 
reason these shareware and freeware authors were so important is because 
there was a lack of commercial projects going on so we needed another 
source for new software. Luckily, there are now an increasing number of 
commercial projects going on. Some of which are now finished. 

To name a few: The Quake port, The Myst Port, The Settlers 2 port, and 
maybe even a port of WipeOut2097. There is also a lot of original software 
being developed on the Amiga, E.G., Napalm. 

Shareware is not the only type of ware that people distribute their product 
as, there are some very weird ones. The most common types of ware are: 

   << 1 >> Shareware
   << 2 >> Freeware
   << 3 >> Charityware
   << 4 >> Giftware
   << 5 >> `Misc`ware

Here is a brief description of each of the above 5 wares:

   << 1 >> Described above

   << 2 >> Freeware is a very common type of ware. It means that the author 
           is not asking for anything in return for his/her effort. 
           Although some do have an option that if you send something that 
           they have specifically asked for, then you might get a version 
           with extra bells and whistles. 

   << 3 >> Charityware is where the registration fee is not paid to the 
           author, instead it is paid to a charity of the author's choice. 

   << 4 >> Giftware is where you have to send the author something other 
           than money. The author might have a particular type of gift that 
           he wants. If the author does not specify what he/she is looking 
           for then it would be best to send them a quick E-mail asking 
           what they would like.

   << 5 >> This is not actually a category, but I could not think of what 
           else to name it This is where the author is asking for something 
           strange, like Chocoware or boozeware ect. where to become a 
           registered user you need to send the author a bar of chocolate 
           or a can of beer. This category can contain anything.

"Is it easy to become a software author and make lots of money?" Somewhere 
at least one person will have asked this question. The answer is yes and 
no. It depends on lots of factors. It CAN be easy to create your own 
software if you have a good idea and you can program, but if you have a 
good idea but can not program it is not as easy. Of course you could use 
one of the software builders like CanDo, but applications like this are 
somewhat limited and it might not be able to do exactly what you wanted it 
to do. Nowadays it is not that hard to program as there is a wide variety 
of programming languages for beginners like Amos and Blitz Basic. 

Amos is a very easy language to get to grips with and perfect for the 
beginner, but due to its simplicity it lacks power, which is what is needed 
for modern day games and programs. Amos also lacks the ability to support 
intuition, although there are a few plug-ins that do offer this. Amos 
programs have a tendency to not work on computers more powerful than a 
standard A1200 with a hard drive and CD-ROM, sometimes even a setup as 
modest as this is enough to make the Amos application cease to run. 

Blitz Basic is by far the best. I would not say that it was aimed at the 
absolute beginner as it is not as easy as Amos, but it does have power, a 
lot of power. Blitz Basic can create almost anything you need, up to the 
point of a really fast and complex three-dimensional racing game like 
WipeOut2097, but it has the power to create some outstanding games. It also 
supports intuition and can create standard intuition windows with a great 
amount of ease. Blitz Basic is not only for the amateur, the professional 
can use it too as you can add in in-line assembler, if you know how to code 
in assembler that is. 

Programming is not the only skill you need to have to create a killer 
application; you also need a good idea that you think people will want. An 
example of this is when the Tamagotchies were around, both the PC and Mac 
had a few virtual pets, but the Amiga had none. So a few Amiga programmers 
around the world (Me included) started to churn out several virtual pets 
for our Amiga`s. It turned out that most Amiga users did not actually want 
any virtual pets, well I have not met any yet.

The other skills that are useful are being able to draw on the computer and 
create music or sound. I say they would be `useful` and not essential as 
there are literally millions of free sound samples and bits of clipart on 
the Internet that you can use, just check out AMI-Net.

So you have actually got the finished product, now you want to know how to 
get it to people. Well this is one of the easiest parts. If it is a game, 
you could do worse than sending it to the Amiga Format Reader Games section.
This is run every issue and the best game of that month gets £50! All of my 
games have been looked reviewed by Amiga Format in this section. They all 
got a crappy, but fair review - which proves my point about it being hard 
to find a good idea. Submitting it to the AMI-Net archive is another 
brilliant idea. You can check out their web site or get their CD, which 
comes out every few months. If you have a web site you could plant a few 
copies of on there.

Recently, I invited 2 friends around. One is an Amiga owner, but he had 
thrown it in the loft a few years back when his family bought a PC. When he 
saw my A1200 setup next to my other machine, his eyes suddenly lit up. He 
immediately asked if I had any good games, I told him that I had a few old 
commercial games but thousands of freeware and shareware games. He looked at
me, puzzled and asked what all this shareware and freeware stuff was - he 
left the Amiga scene as soon as Commodore went down the drain so he did not 
know about things like AMI-Net. I told him all about them and he did not 
seem to impressed, "Created by normal people? They are not very good then." 
Was his reply. This annoyed me slightly, so I switched it on my A1200 and 
loaded up one of favourites. I told them how to play it and gave them a 
controller each. Before they played it they were not interested, with the 
"Oh go on then. If I HAVE to play it." Attitude. But after 5 minutes of 
playing it they were really enjoying themselves. They liked it so much that 
they would not let me have a go! We spent about 4 hours playing it - if you 
have ever played it you will know how simple and addictive it is. I then 
showed them KnockOut and a few other games and they seemed to love Amiga`s. 
Within a week, my friend dug out his old A1200 and now I have to give him a 
game or 2 a week to play on. You may be wondering why I told this story; 
the reason is that it has a sort of moral to it. The moral is:

   Commercial games are not always the best. They may have brilliant 
   graphics and sound but sometimes the simplest games have the most 
   gameplay and addiction.

It was not the brilliantly textured graphics running at 50 FPS on a dual-
parallax scrolling display and it was not the awesome CD quality sound with 
cool sampled sound effects that brought my friend back to the Amiga. The 
games that brought him back were the simple 16bit 32 colour freeware and 
shareware games.
