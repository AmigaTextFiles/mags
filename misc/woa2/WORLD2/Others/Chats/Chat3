The Chat - 3

Welcome to the Third chat! This time, we have a guest who speaks! Cybermonk
joins later, but only says a few words and then nothing else! We had
problems with this aswell. I got cut off twice, and the second time caused
big probs and I couldn't reconnect. Anyway, It's just me and Sam again, and
Cybermonk later on.

<Troggy> I think so.

<AMI-Gerbi> do you think it will work?

<AMI-Gerbi> its true for an isp though

<AMI-Gerbi> so, what we gonna talk bout t`night

<Troggy> well for starters, what's the QNX demo like?

<Troggy> cool. that where you got the idea for a web server?

<AMI-Gerbi> 3d demo, game and a bit more

<AMI-Gerbi> yeppy

<Troggy> you like that word? :)

<AMI-Gerbi> the problem is that the demo don`t find hd

<AMI-Gerbi> so you cannot use your hd

<Troggy> the problem for me is it doesn't bloody work :)

<AMI-Gerbi> so you need to save and load everything to disk, which is full

<AMI-Gerbi> :)

<Troggy> It say's its got about 3 gig on it

<AMI-Gerbi> what, your hd

<Troggy> no the floppy.

<AMI-Gerbi> mine is 2.6 with 10% left!

<AMI-Gerbi>  floppy with 3gig?

<Troggy> I don't think it does have 3 gig on it

<Troggy> but the QNX demo buggered the disk up

<AMI-Gerbi> somehow, neither do i

<Troggy> and windows says it has 3 gig on it

<AMI-Gerbi> all files are compressed

<AMI-Gerbi> its probably a shitty disk

<Troggy> yeh. probably.

<AMI-Gerbi> try it with a different disk
