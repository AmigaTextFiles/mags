Welcome to the Chat type thing

This time, we had loads of new problems. It was ok last time, if a bit slow,
but this time we used proper IRC (Undernet, #amiclub) and because neither
me, nor sam are all that used to IRC, we just messed around and tried to
get to know it a bit better for now. We had loads of problems, such as
computers crashing and stuff like that. Unfortunately, the first half of
the chat was lost to a disk error which means that you enter just after
Sam's PC has had some probs. Here's a list of people who talk

Troggy: Me, Neil.

AmiGerbil, Ami-Gerbi and Sammy: Sam Brookes, our PD Editor.

Konny: Konny was already there before me and sam appeared.

Zonkers: Someone who entered and left wihout saying anything :)
