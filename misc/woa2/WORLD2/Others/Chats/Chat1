The Chat!

Today, we have just two people on the chat. I thought there would be more, 
but no-one else turned up. Me and Sam Brooks is all you're going to get 
tonight. Bear in mind this is the first ever talk of this nature so you 
have to excuse the fact that the bloody chat room we used was sh... crap :). 
Ah, and I didn't mean to call Amiga Format 'Bloody Idiots'. :)

Here's who's chatting and their aliases:

Trogladite - That's me! Neil, The Editor! Yes, you know the one :)
Ami Gerbil - Sam Brooks. Both of us using a cacky PC :(

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trogladite: Right. Sorry about the delay. I was replying to your Email 
            (still haven't finished).

ami-gerbil: i almost logged off

ami-gerbil: whats this all about then

Trogladite: just general chat. You've seen Nick Anderson's work on AF?

ami-gerbil: hello?

ami-gerbil: yep - my web site is full of nicks stuff

Trogladite: hi. Nick Anderson? remember?

Trogladite: Argh! This is slow!

ami-gerbil: my humour section (200 pages) is just from nick!

Trogladite: Right. Nick anderson has Conference type things in his Diskmag. 
            I thought I might try it.

ami-gerbil: I hate though bloody banners at the top

ami-gerbil: cool - how you recording it

ami-gerbil: cut`n`paste

Trogladite: I'm recording it using cut'n'paste. yep

Trogladite: Trouble is, the text is scrolling off the top!

ami-gerbil: OK

ami-gerbil: Glad you liked my articles

Trogladite: Yes, they were good.

ami-gerbil: your right this is too slow

Trogladite: Just a quick word, I'm going to have to keep going to Notepad 
            and copying text from here to it.

ami-gerbil: ok- that won`t matter much, its slow any way

ami-gerbil: a few second ain`t gonna make ant difference

Trogladite: Did you miss me. Internet Explorer just bloody crashed!

ami-gerbil: is Antoni gonna join?

ami-gerbil: I get that a lot too - I got an ad for netscape at top of mypage 
            now!

Trogladite: He can't. He's not here. He doesn't live here and there's only 
            one compuer on the net.

Trogladite: My banner's disappeared :) weird.

Trogladite: Hey, sam, are you on ICQ?

ami-gerbil: ICQ? whats that?

Trogladite: ICQ, you get a number and you can have decent real time chat 
            with people. Better than this crap :)

ami-gerbil: Don`t think so

ami-gerbil: No

Trogladite: Go to www.mirabilis.com and download the program (PC only)

Trogladite: It lets you keep track of people you know and if they are 
            online or not. It's cool.

ami-gerbil: my Amiga ain`t on the net I have to use a PC - PC only don`t 
            matter

Trogladite: My ICQ number is 27873010. Just type it in your contact list 
            when you get ICQ.

ami-gerbil: you mean a pager thing?

Trogladite: Then you can see when I'm online and instantly contact me!

Trogladite: Something like a pager type thing. Yes, I'd recommend it.

Trogladite: You'll be receiving an Email from me soon, by the way.

ami-gerbil: by the way, have you done a review of Simon Hitchens (?) 
            Revenge game?

Trogladite: I've heard of Revenge, never played it though.

            Feb one is

Trogladite: I'm not saying Farm Stores lemonade is bad. That was a heated 
            argument, eh? :)

Trogladite: Yes, the speed... er, speed... what speed? :)

ami-gerbil: we type something and it end up after something else

Trogladite: It's not what can be described as fast.

ami-gerbil: speed of this IRC

ami-gerbil: see what I mean about one of my prev staements

Trogladite: Yes. I think we should type something and then wait for the 
            other person to reply before continuing.

Trogladite: hehe. This is annoying!

ami-gerbil: If you want help with that Blitz thing, why don`t you tell the 
            readers about it and they can e-mail you

ami-gerbil: tell the readers here that is

Trogladite: Hmm. My Amiga's just crashed behind me. Wonder why :(

ami-gerbil: I`ve gotta go in 10 mins

Trogladite: Oh yes, readers, how do you read input from GTPalette? HELP ME 
            PLEASE!!!

Trogladite: 10 mins, ok. I can just about stand this speed for that length 
            of time.

ami-gerbil: sorry!

ami-gerbil: :)

Trogladite: Oh, thanks for putting a link to my site on yours.

            the music I like?
