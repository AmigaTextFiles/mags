Trogsofts First Game?

Trogladite Software may be producing it's first game. We would like
people who are skilled in 3D rendering and have plenty of time to
spare. We also may require 2D artists, and while you should still
apply, we cannot guarantee that you will be used for this particular
project.

The game will probably be rendered throughout with the possibility of
2D characters. It will be set on a distant planet in the year 2190.
Earlier in the same century, humans crash landed on the distant
planet, and now, the same thing has happened again. The two groups of
humans then try to escape from the planet using parts from the two
crashed ships, but meet an alien mother ship who takes them on board
and the humans are left in a cell while the aliens prepare to carry
out tests on them.

Guess what, you must escape the ship and get back to earth, and you
will meet several types of alien, some friendly, some not so friendly,
on the way! Sound good? Well, as the plot develops, we will add new
things and play around with the graphics.

If you are interested in helping with the 3D or 2D graphics or have
an idea for a name, then please email nb@trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk
with the subject 'New Game'. Terms and conditions will be emailed to
you along with pay arrangments. Yes, you will be payed because we
intend to get this game released commercially.

HOWEVER! While it is very likely that we can get it published, there
is a chance we may not get it published. In which case, the project will
either be shelved, or made freeware, either way, no-one will make any
money from it and anyone applying must be prepared for such an outcome.
While it is unlikely that we won't be able to find a publisher, there
is always that chance.

Neil.
