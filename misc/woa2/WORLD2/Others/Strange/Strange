Weird

Just a quick word to point out the similarity between the new PC type
machine, the 'Aztec' and the shelved Amiga 'Walker' project which
Amiga tech started under the control of Escom.

I bet no-one will complain about this one either. The Amiga looked
like a vacuum cleaner, but this new PC looks even more like a vacuum
than the Walker (nicknamed 'Carpet Walker') ever did! And the simple
reason for this is the lack of curves that the Aztec box posseses.

Anyway, tell me what you think and I'll stick the letters in the 
Mailbag section next issue.
