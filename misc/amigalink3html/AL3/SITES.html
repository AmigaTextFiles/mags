Where to find Amiga Link</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<PRE>     You probably have noticed that we have dropped the BBS list at Amiga
 Link.  This is because after my hard drive crashed, I found it too much of
 a hassle to run the BBS list.  Considering how popular the Internet is
 becoming, I believe that in a little while, most people will be on the
 Internet and have access to the WWW and Aminet.
 
     If you wish to receive Amiga Link in e-mail each month, mail the
 address &lt;amigalink-request@ramiga.cts.com&gt; with the message 
 
 ADD &lt;your e-mail address&gt;
 
     Then, every time the magazine comes out, it will be mailed to you
 UUENcoded.  The magazine is quite big, so if your e-mail address cannot
 accept messages of atleast 100k, don't put your name on the list.  
     If you want to be taken off the lits, do the same thing, but
 subsititute DELETE for ADD.
 
     If you have the use of AMosaic or Lynx on your BBS, you can view Amiga
 Link online on 8 different WWW pages.  Their addresses are:
 
 
 <http://ramiga.cts.com&gt;  Roy Millican's home page, one of the best around!
 
 <http://weber.u.washington.edu/~foregone/amigalink/main.html&gt;
 
 <http://www.iglou.com/members/dloeser.html&gt;
 
 <http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/~mjw/amiga/News/Alink&gt;  The Amiga home page!
 Check this page out!

 <http://mm.iit.uni-miskolc.hu/Data/AL&gt;     
 
 <http://tedgebbs.is.net/&gt;
 
     Ofcourse, you can also get Amiga Link off of the docs/mags directory
 of Aminet, or off many local BBSs.
