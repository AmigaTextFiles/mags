     Yes, the following people have climbed to the highest rung of Amiga
 life: To write for Amiga Link!

     Joshua Galun is the Editor-in-Chief of Amiga Link, and he wrote the
 page with all the information on the bankruptcy's end (the Reader's Digest
 version!), the Editorial, and Imaginary Amiga ad #3.  Send comments,
 letters to the mag, information, dirty gifs, or anything else related to
 the mag, to &lt;Zool@cyberwar.com&gt;

     Roy Millican is the Technical Editor of Amiga Link.  He handles
 everything that Joshua is afraid to touch, and he's a pretty handy writer
 too!  E-mail him at &lt;roy@cts.com&gt;

     Joe Solinsky isn't in advertising, he doesn't even have a TV to watch
 his ad when it hits the airwaves, but he wrote the Imaginary Amiga ad #1
 for all those people who won't believe that the Amiga is good unless they
 see an ad for it during Star Trek!  He can be reached at
 <jcsky@cs.UCR.edu&gt;
 
     Glenn Saunders (krishna@primenet.com) also believes that the Amiga can
 make a comeback, but only if there are ads for it on TV.  And with talent
 like this, as shown by his Imaginary Amiga Ad #3, we're sure that some
 advertising company will snap him up in a second!
 
     Brian Strayer is the C= 64 user who won our hearts with his ongoing
 story, Some Bits of Treasure.  E-mail him at &lt;bstrayer@efn.org&gt;
 
         Bil Irving of Visions Perceived Software shared his views on what
 Escom and Dr. Peter Kittel must do to make the Amiga a major computer
 system again.  You can rebutt him or send him your consent in e-mail, at 
 <b.irving@zippy.dct.ac.uk&gt;
