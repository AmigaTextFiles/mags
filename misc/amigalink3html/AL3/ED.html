<PRE>     As the immortal Opus of Bloom County once said, when it rains, it
 pours cats and dogs.  Nothing ever goes smoothly down at the Amiga Link
 Offices, and this month was no exception.
 
     To begin, I have some sad news to announce.  Because of disagreements
 between John Vlachos and myself, we have parted ways.  However, the split
 was not a friendly one, and John has refused to give up use of the Amiga
 Link name, and he is attempting to make his own Amiga Link.  If you happen
 to pick up his magazine (IF he puts it out), please understand that I am
 not affiliated with it if my name is not on it.  The quality of my Amiga
 Link will not change, as all the other writers and the mailing list
 coordinator is still with me, and because I have done all the editing in
 the past.  I'd also like to apologize to all the innocent Fidonet users
 who had to wade through the endless posts about this situation.  See?  No
 more posts! :)
 
     You might also notice that Amiga Link #3 is VERY late this month.
 The issue was almost complete, when just hours before I was going to send
 it out, my monitor broke.  My dealer could not repair it for 8 days, and I
 couldn't hook up my Amiga into the TV for lack of the correct adaptor.
 However, to make up for the late issue, Amiga Link #4 should come out
 early, most likely on May 15, so keep an eye out for it!
 
     Sigh...now I've gone and bored you.  Maybe this will wake you up,
 and although you probably know it already, here goes anyway:
 
         COMMODORE HAS BEEN BOUGHT!  THE BANKRUPTCY IS OVER!
         
     Wow...glad to get that one off of my chest!  Yes, Escom has bought the
 Amiga.  I for one, am very happy.  All the information on this is in the
 issue.  
 
     Anyway, look for Amiga Link #4 soon, which will have a real editorial,
 one which, unlike this one, will NOT be written at midnight while trying
 to get over a hangover...
