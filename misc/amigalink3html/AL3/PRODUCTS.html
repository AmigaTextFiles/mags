<PRE>    In using our Amigas and making Amiga Link, we have come across 
 some products and services that we believe exemplary.  These products have
 all received the much desired Amiga Link Chicken Seal of Quality.
 They are as follows:    
  
 <b>@Heddley</b>:  This is a program to make Amiga Guide documents (such as the one
 you are reading write now), and it is incredible!  Not only is it very 
 easy to use, but it also cuts the time needed to make an Amiga Guide doc
 by a factor of 8, and has many great features!  It's so good that
 we use Heddley here at Amiga Link!  You can find Heddley v1.1 on Aminet.
 The author is Edd Dumbill.
 
 <b>@Page Stream 3.0g</b>:  Version 3 of this product was released early because of
 pressure, and as a result is was very buggy.  However, Soft Logik has been
 very good about trying to fix the bugs and about spreading the new
 releases around.  Page Stream 3.0g is not perfect, but it's pretty damn
 close!  This product really brings the Amiga DTP up to industry standards,
 and we reccomend it to anyone interested in doing DTP on the Amiga, or any
 computer!
