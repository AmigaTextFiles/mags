Imaginary Amiga Ad #3</TITLE>

     This was written a few months ago, so please don't e-mail me telling
 me that the Microsoft and Apple as campaigns took place months in the
 past!
 
     As you may or may not know, both Microsoft and Apple Macintosh have
 recently launched new advertising campaigns.  In Microsoft's they show you
 images of lots of 6 year old Caucasians with huge eyes and old Asians
 looking into the camera.  While you are seeing these sickeningly cute
 images in the background you hear supposedly awe-inspiring music and 
 subliminal messages (like "This stuff we make, it makes you powerful," and
 "Gather up your ideas, we can't wait to see what you do"), and
 occasionally, a glimpse of the Windows logo or some software.  In the
 Macintosh advertisements you see people trying to do various procedures
 with a PC and failing because it is so complicated, and then going over to
 a friend's house to do the procedure on a Mac.  After giving some serious
 thought to these commercials I began to plan the fantasy ad for the Amiga
 in my head (it's obviously a fantasy, for when was the last time you saw
 an Amiga ad period, let alone a good one?)  Some sort of mix of the Mac
 and Microsoft ads.  
 
     Yeah...that would be good...
     
     The ad opens up with a man trying to save the world from total nuclear
 destruction on his PC (not a game, it would be a real experience).  He is
 frustrated because the PC keeps saying:

 Not ready error reading drive B Abort, Fail, Retry?  
 Abort, Retry, Fail?

     He finally gets so frustrated that he calls a friend and asks him if
 he can come over and use his Amiga to save the world.  The friend is
 hesitant, telling him that he IS in the middle of computer chess, but OK,
 he can use his Amiga.  
 
      You see the man walk up to the door of his friend's house and walk in
 with his friend.  An image of the faces of a 6 year old girl with huge
 eyes and an old man appear on the screen for now reason at all, although
 it looks cute.  
 
     Suddenly a blinding light streams out from the room in front of the
 camera.  At the same time "Thus Spake Zarathustra" begins to play (you
 know, the song from 2001!) the man walks into the light filled room and
 sees the Amiga. (A bit like those cheesy Alien encounters on TV)  The
 music reaches a chreschendo and then switches from "Thus Came Zarathustra"
 to Hendel's "Messiah."  In the background you hear subliminal messages
 telling you to buy 50 Amigas.  The man sits down at the Amiga.  He begins
 to type away in an effort to save the world.  His friend approaches him
 and begins to use the mouse.  The man says, "Excuse me, I'm trying to save
 the world!"  
 
     "No problem," says the friend, "Amigas have had true multi-tasking
 since 1986.  
 
     The friend is visibly impressed as he watches his friend render in
 Lightwave as the computer works on stopping a nuclear missle countdown.
 
     The man is so overjoyed that you see him buy an Amiga and throw his PC
 out a window.  We come back to him three years later, and his formerly
 bald head now has hair on it, his teeth sparkle, and he lives in a
 mansion.  
 
     The ad ends with the new Amiga logo and a slogan that says:
     
         The Amiga:  So Powerful it Will Grow Hair on Your Head
         
         
         
     OK, maybe there are some slight "exaggerations" in the advertisement,
 but really, the Amiga hasn't had an ad in America for so long that it
 should be excused for a few fibs.  
 
 
     Besides, Microsoft has been fibbing for years, and nobody's noticed,
 so why should it be any different for the Amiga?
