   jcompton&gt; Welcome to the First and (I hope) Last Commodore Auction
            Conference, sponsored by Amiga Report and Amiga Link
            Magazines-"It's news, and it's cheap.  What more do you want?"

   jcompton&gt; The ground rules:

   jcompton&gt; We'll be explaining, in as much detail as is possible, what
            happened over the past two days of the Commodore auction
            proceedings.

   jcompton&gt; Then our esteemed op-panel of developers will be free to offer
            any questions or comments they see fit (careful, boys).

   jcompton&gt; After that, we'll go to the floor for questions.  This is a
            very complicated affair...if you weren't aware Commodore was in
            liquidation, you'll probably not catch up tonight.

   jcompton&gt; The Auction issue of Amiga Report Magazine should be making
            its rounds now.../msg your neighbor for a DCC if you don't have
            it yet.  (note-don't /msg me...)

   jcompton&gt; With that said...if there are no objections from the ops, I'll
             delve into a mini-summary of what's happened...

   jcompton&gt; No?  Ok, here goes.

   jcompton&gt; The Short Version: Escom AG, the #2 German PC clone
            manufacturer, has successfully entered a bid for Commodore's
            assets, including (but certainly not limited to) the Amiga
            technology.

   jcompton&gt; The slightly more explained version:  Yesterday (Thursday) was
            the auction for Commodore.  What we had been lead to expect was
            a heated bidding battle between CEI's Alex Amor and C= UK's
            David Pleasance...after all, they'd been the most vocal in
            their

   jcompton&gt; pursuit for the Amiga.

   jcompton&gt; As it turns out, neither of them bid.  Instead, the only three
            bids came from Escom, Dell (a large US PC clone maker) and a
            California dealer.

   jcompton&gt; The Dell and dealer bids were thrown out.  Escom's $5 million
            contract, signed in March, was accepted by the liquidator.

   jcompton&gt; Almost immediately after the auction, the C= UK heads issued a
            press release withdrawing from the running.

   jcompton&gt; The next day (Friday), at the court hearing, the objections to
            the process were heard.

   jcompton&gt; From what I've gathered from the attendees (Josh Galun and
            Giorgio Gomelsky), the three pre-filed objections from C= US'
            creditors, IBM, and the C= Netherlands/Philippines/UK trustees
            were done with without a ton of effort.

   jcompton&gt; However, it seems that the C= Netherlands people were
            temporarily successful in removing the Philippines inventory of
            parts and Commodore UK from the buyout package.

   jcompton&gt; The other objection came from Dell, who, in conjunction with
            Alex Amor, entered a new $15 million bid.

   jcompton&gt; This did not please Escom.  A recess was called.  At the end
            of the recess, Escom had doubled their bid, that bid was
            accepted, and so ends the process.

   jcompton&gt; The Bahamas Supreme Court still has to approve the deal next
            week, but by their own agreement, it should be nothing more
            than a rubber-stamp process.

   jcompton&gt; In addition, Escom could always fail to close the deal, in
            which case the second-highest bidder, Dell, would be offered
            the package.  Dell has asked for a 30 day "trial" period on the
            Amiga, which was part of the unacceptable (to the liquidators)
            condition of their bid.

   jcompton&gt; However, as of now, Escom is the heir to the Commodore suite.
            What they choose to do with this is at present unclear.

   jcompton&gt; They have promised everything from more Amigas to Commodore
            64s for China and "Commodore" Macintosh clones.

   jcompton&gt; That about covers what I've got on my mind now.  Josh?
            Anything to add?

       Zool&gt; Yes, I do Jason.  Thanks a lot for a nice summary

       Zool&gt; OK.  Just to expand on what Jason said about the bidding...

       Zool&gt; Yesterday, Dell/CEI entered a bid, however it was rejected in
            favor of Escom's bid.  After this, Dell kept working with on
            their deal

       Zool&gt; Dell submitted the bid, which was higher, but also required a
            30 day waiting period.  Anyway, as you now know, Escom raised
            their bid by 6.5 million dollars, and that cleared up all the
            obhections

       Zool&gt; Anyway, I did an interview with the man who will be heading
            the Amiga devision at Escom, and this is what he had to say

       Zool&gt; (I can't remember his name)  He said that Escom wants to
            improve on the Amiga technology.  Tight now, they are
            interested in making a Power PC Amiga, although that is not a
            decision written in stone

       Zool&gt; He said that they have an agreement with a Chinese
            manufacturer, who will be shipping new Amigas in 2 months

       Zool&gt; They said that they also want to use the Amiga technology for
            other products, such as set top boxes for TV

       Zool&gt; When I asked them about liscencing Amiga clones, they said
            that anything was a possibility at this point, and that we may
            see Amiga clones

       Zool&gt; Escom sounded very open on their policy on the Amiga, as much
            of what I questioned them on was replied to with "yes, that may
            be possible.  We'll look into it"

       Zool&gt; Later in the day I talked to Colin Proudfoot of C= UK.

       Zool&gt; Colin Proudfoot said that in Escom is meeting with C= UK in
            two weeks, and that Escom will most likely buy C= UK at that
            point 
            
       Zool&gt; Colin said that Escom may have wanted the Amiga to use it to
            go into the US Computer market

       Zool&gt; He said that Escom doesn't want to start up an American
            operation with only PCs, since you can already get PCs very
            cheaply in the US.  On the other hand, if they came into the
            computer market with new technoilogy, that would seperate them
            from the crowd 

       Zool&gt; Escom, by the way, said that they would try to hire as many
            ex-C= techs as possible, and that they already have some on
            their staff.  They did say, however, that some ex-C= techs
            already had new jobs that they were haooy with

       Zool&gt; Anyway, in the end, my interview with Escom left me pretty
            satisfied with their plans.

       Zool&gt; Although I think that CEI/DELL would have been better for the
            Amiga, Escom could still be very good, especially with the
            business savvy and 2 billion dollars in sales they had last
            year

       Zool&gt; Alex Amor, when he lost the bid, sat stoically, and left soon
            after the announcement.  He made no comment on what had
            happened

       Zool&gt; Jason, I give the floor back to you.

  Devophile&gt; Zool: I am sure I speak for everyone when I thank you for this
            information.

       Zool&gt; Devophile:  it was my pleasure.

   jcompton&gt; For those of you who worry about transcripts, a raw version
            will be available soon after the conference.  After that, if
            you want an edited version, wait for the appearance on Aminet
            or for AR 3.09 or Amiga Link #3.

       Zool&gt; I would also like to say that the text version of my
            interviews with Escom and C= UK should be on Aminet soon.
            
   jcompton&gt; I've had time to read over Josh and Giorgio's interview with
            Escom.  Obviously, he was with the guy, so I'm one level
            removed.

   jcompton&gt; Still, I am not exactly convinced that Escom's interests lie
            with the Amiga.  From a strictly financial point of view, Escom
            is poised to launch their PCs in the UK (now that they have
            obtained the Commodore name AND the large chain of Rumbelowes
            stores)

       Zool&gt; About the Phillipine plant, although Escom does not have it
            yet, apparently they should have it very soon.

   jcompton&gt; ...they have spoken of Mac clones, and of course C-64s in
            China.  With markets like that, it seems that the Amiga could
            easily fall by the wayside...thinking that the Amiga is an
            inroad to the US is ludicrous-Escom hasn't checked the Amiga's
            public image in the US lately.

    KermitW&gt; I don't think that's the point.

  Devophile&gt; jcompton: The plans for the US market seem to be right on the
            nose, as far as the US is concerned. New technology can be
            welcomed or outcast, depending on how it is brought forward.

       Zool&gt; Escom believes that the Amiga can make money, which is why
            they're in this, and not because they have any fondness for the
            amiga.  However, they will pour money into Amiga R&D, and they
            think that the Amiga can make money for them

  Devophile&gt; jcompton: Let us hope Escom knows what they are doing.

         AK&gt; Does Escom have the capital and willing to use it to launch a
            marketing plan in the US.

       Zool&gt; AK: they have the capital

   jcompton&gt; So, of course, the logical course of action is to make sure
            they DON'T forget.  They have repeatedly avoided contact with
            the Amiga community and lied to journalists.  I'm not accusing
            them of doing it in this case, but my point is that there are
            no assurances.  I currently have no contact information for
            Escom...Josh?

   Fastlane&gt; jcompton: what ever happened to the 'rumor' that Escom had a
            side-deal with CEI with regards to the technology and the
            trademarks?

       Zool&gt; AK:  I believe that they will market it in the US, because
            according to C= UK, they want to make inroads into the US
            market

   jcompton&gt; Fastlane: Considering that Escom told Alex that their
            relationship depended on his performance at the auction, and
            that he tossed in his hat with Dell...well, CEI isn't ruling
            anything out, but I'm not holding my breath.

  Devophile&gt; Fastlane: The smart thing for Escom to do would be a joint
            deal with CEI, as CEI knows the US market and has the
            distribution channels. Plus, a strong goal to get the Amiga
            back on top.

       Zool&gt; Fastlane:  It is conceivable that Escom might liscence Amiga
            clones to CEI

   jcompton&gt; Kermit: You were going to say something?

   Fastlane&gt; Devophile: agreed.  Escom only seems to want it all for the
            name anyway.

    fallous&gt; Why don't we hear from the developers before we turn this
            loose to the rest of us?

  Devophile&gt; fallous: Agreed.

   jcompton&gt; fallous: That was what I was trying to get to. :)

         AK&gt; When will Escom make a official press release?

       Zool&gt; Fastlane:  As I said, Escom seems excited about the Amiga. The
            man from Escom said "We wouldn't have spent all this time and
            12 million dollars if we didn't want the Amiga"

    KermitW&gt; Only that the Amiga lends a uniqueness to a company looking to
            startup in the

       Zool&gt; AK:  Probably tommorow, to AP

    KermitW&gt; US market that they would lack with yet-another-pc-clone.  It
            might not be the

   jcompton&gt; AK: "When they're damn good and ready", I would expect.

    KermitW&gt; top of their market or even a large part of it, but it could
           be the thing that

    KermitW&gt; could keep them in the press and, face it, the Amiga's still
            pretty good at

       Zool&gt; And Escom wouldn't pour money into R&D for the Amiga if they
            didn't want to continute with the Amiga brand

    KermitW&gt; getting used in TV and film venues for publicity.  CBM never
            truly made use of this, but a smart company could.

   jcompton&gt; Zool: Until we see some serious commitment from Escom, and
            some serious former employees-not C= Germany exec and sales
            staff, Commodore engineering.

   jcompton&gt; Zool: Until then, there's no guarantee of anything.

       Zool&gt; KermitW:  Escom has business smarts.

  PillBottl&gt; Zool: But they need engineering smarts too.

  Devophile&gt; All: Escom needs to face the reality that the Amiga is still a
            viable platform. And with proper R&D, marketting, and
            distribution - the Amiga can make Escom a lot of money. But
            they need to support the users, the developers, and listen to
            comments

  Devophile&gt; and suggestions.

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  True, but Escom did sound excited about the Amiga.
            I genuinely think that Escom wants to market and sell Amigas.

    fallous&gt; Kevin, do you have a view from SoftLogik?

         AK&gt; Will Escom pursue 3rd party support that has sence left the
            Amiga?

    KermitW&gt; Until I see otherwise, I would assume Escom is business smart.

       Zool&gt; PillBottl:  that's why they are hiring ex-C= techs.

   jcompton&gt; Zool: Then why avoid contact with the Amiga market since
            August of 1994?

   Beowulf_&gt; I assume it's also not out of the question for Escom to
            license the Amiga technology to third parties...

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  I don't know.  Perhaps because C= was a hideous
            company, and they didn't want to deal with them?  Also, they
            said that they had sold Amigas at Escom stores before

    KermitW&gt; Remember that some of that third party support that left the
            Amiga, left

  softlogik&gt; Soft-Logik is comitted to the Amiga as long as long as the
            market can support them. No special info on Escom yet.

    KermitW&gt; because they WEREN'T successful on the Amiga, and many still
            weren't

    KermitW&gt; relatively successful after leaving anyway.

       Zool&gt; KermitW:  Yes, but Escom is going to buy C= UK, and C= UK had
            GREAT developer relationship.  They put on a World of Amiga
            show after C= died.

  PillBottl&gt; A big pat on the back to Softlogik and the other "important"
            developers who kept the faith!

      bytey&gt; The real question is will a real effort be made to get a new
            Amiga model out (new chipset) and that would require a _lot_ of
            work software wise.  Do they have previous software staff ?
            (Chris Hames PC-Task/DirWork etc)

  Devophile&gt; A comment I just received was in regards to why developers are
            "tripping over each other to leave this platform", simply
            because C= did not support developers, nor users as well as
            should have, and have been basically gone for a year. :)

       Zool&gt; bytey:  They did say that they had and were hiring ex-C=
            people.
             
       Zool&gt; bytey:  Some C= techs don't want to come back, though.

    KermitW&gt; As a developer (of ImageFX) I can say that it wasn't like
            anyone is forcing

  Devophile&gt; Softlogik: Thank you for not betraying us, we are all
            appreciative.

      bytey&gt; Zool: But ex CBM does not mean ex US software developers.  The
            ones with the knowledge that would take months to learn.

    KermitW&gt; developers to leave the Amiga.  The market, your sales, are
            what push you into

       Zool&gt; SoftLogik:  I'm with Devophile.  Nice job, you guys!

        Nyx&gt; Well, forget my log guys. :P

    KermitW&gt; new platforms.  A lot of companies who visibly and audibly
            left the Amiga to

         AK&gt; Devophile: Be tray is alittle strong, they just have to think
            of the business aspect.

      Cappy&gt; As the president of one of the most successful C= user groups
            in the country, I hope that a US branch gets implimented soon
            and get user groups involved as much as possible.

  Devophile&gt; Cappy: Yes.

    KermitW&gt; go to Macs, SGIs and PCs weren't run well or making the money
            they needed.  In

  softlogik&gt; The boss thanks you.

    lemming&gt; There is a log being kept by t00 still

    KermitW&gt; many cases it's because their Amiga products weren't "up to
            snuff" anymore.

       Zool&gt; bytey:  Well, I assume the reason they are hiring ex-C= people
            is to get people with smarts on the Amiga OS.  Also, many ex-C=
            people don't want to come back because they have already found
            nice jobs.

  Devophile&gt; AK: Yes. It was a poor choice of words. :) "abandon" would
            have been better.

    fallous&gt; Such as GVP

       Zool&gt; Cappy:  Escom said that they would be starting a US operation
            pretty soon.  I'll have the info on that within 2 weeks.

      bytey&gt; have they said anything about _real_ developer support ?

     Light2&gt; All:  Bernard van Tienen ESCOM was vice-president of Commodore
            International.  Does he have a track record we can follow?

       Zool&gt; bytey:  Nothing other than:  "Yes, we'll work with developers"

       Zool&gt; Light2:  BTW, that was who I spoke with at Escom

   jcompton&gt; bytey: Again, there have been no solid commitments, just a lot
            of broad based indications of what CAN happen.

   Fastlane&gt; Zool: that has been said by many before... but did it ever
            REALLY eventuate?

  Devophile&gt; I just received an amusing comment.. "Did Sony buy Amiga or
            what?"

      Cappy&gt; Zool: Does Escom have an email address that they can be
            reached?  I'd like to press the issue of the importance of user
            groups.

       Zool&gt; FastLane:  Who has said that before?  Other than C=?

       Zool&gt; Cappy:  I don't believe so.

       Zool&gt; Devophile:  :)

   Fastlane&gt; Zool: my point exactly.

     Light2&gt; Zool:  Yes, I read the transcripts.  I would really like to
            know what to expect.  Previous track records in mind.

   jcompton&gt; Cappy: E-mail?  Not to our knowledge.  That would make too
            much sense.  They're not even sure if they want to use the net
            to help promote their product.

    KermitW&gt; We're quite willing to give Escom the time they need to do
            this.  It can't

      Idcmp&gt; Many ex-C='s like Dave Haynie and Dale Larson have already
            said that they don't like the direction that Escom is planning
            for the Amiga and

       Zool&gt; Fastlane: Yes, that is a problem.  But since we have no real
            choice in this, we have to jhope for the best.

    KermitW&gt; possibly happen overnight or even over just two months.
            Developer support,

      Idcmp&gt; it would take more $$ rather than less or equal $$ to get them
            to go back to R&D rather than if CEI or alike had got it.

    KermitW&gt; user group programs, new machines, all this will take time for
            anyone.

       Zool&gt; You know, if Amiga users had banded together, we could have
            had a legal right to send a representative to the court hearing
            to plead for who we wanted?

       Zool&gt; Idcmp:  Yes, but Escom has a lot of money.

      Cappy&gt; jcompton or Zool: How about a snail mail address?

   jcompton&gt; Um, guys, I hate to interject, but we're losing the flow
            here...

  Devophile&gt; Another comment, Dell has a better "image" in the US than
            Escom.  People might be more apt to but Amigas with the Dell
            name versus Amigas with the Escom name.

   Beowulf_&gt; jcompton:  Is there a snail mail address?

      Idcmp&gt; Zool: And in that sense Escom is alot like Commodore. (was)

       Zool&gt; Devophile:  I dobut that will make much a difference once
            Escom has an operation here.

    fallous&gt; OK, jcompton wants to gain some control, so I'm deopping a few
            of us

   jcompton&gt; Beo: None that I have access to.  Zool may have one, if not,
            I'll try to get it from Dan Stets.

  Devophile&gt; Let us all give Jason control again. 

   jcompton&gt; Everyone, please calm down.  I'd like to actually let the
            general public be heard, so...

    fallous&gt; Sorry, der Fuhr made me do it. ;)

       Zool&gt; fallous:  For the good of the whole, write? :)

    Bandini&gt; Is NewTek still supporting the Amiga or are they concentrating
            their efforts on IBM Toasters?

   jcompton&gt; Ok, am I back in charge?

   jcompton&gt; Bandini: SHHHHHHHHH.

    fallous&gt; OK, let's have jcompton run this show.

   jcompton&gt; Ok.  I guess I do.  I'm going to start taking requests for
            comments/questions.  /msg me with a ?.  You have to be on
            #auction for this to work...

   jcompton&gt; You'll be voiced.  Make your question/comment and then hit GA
            for "Go Ahead."

   jcompton&gt; Um, ok, that's enough, thanks. :)  Hold off.

   jcompton&gt; Um anybody else messaging me with a ? will be ignored, I have
            a very long list...

   jcompton&gt; Stop, for now, thanks/.

            shadowhwk niteflite  byter  chamer...

   jcompton&gt; mitchman: Go.

   Mitchman&gt; Did they mention any plans for a US-based R&D department? This
            is obviously needed if any of the old engineers is to return.

   Mitchman&gt; ga

   jcompton&gt; Mitchman: No specific locales were given, although some
            engineers have indicated their willingness to relocate in the
            pass (Chris Ludwig, for example.)

   jcompton&gt; (past, that is.)

   jcompton&gt; Harv's up.

       Harv&gt; So what's up with Alex/CEI?......

       Harv&gt; I can't believe he's just gonig to fade away.....

       Harv&gt; is an Escom/CEI deal possible? or even desireable? GA

       Zool&gt; Harv:  He could possibly get a liscence to clone Amigas.

   jcompton&gt; Harv: Well, Giorgio told me Alex said "I'm going to grow
            flowers."  I haven't talked to him today.  He didn't give up
            over a year's time, so...

   jcompton&gt; Harv: At the same time, throwing in with Dell certainly didn't
            help him in Escom's eyes.  On the other hand, money's still
            money.

     PieMan&gt; Thankyou. Does escom have any plans to continue to manifacture
            amiga cd32 console type machines? ga

   jcompton&gt; Fallous is handling voice, he's a bit behind, so just hold
            on...

       Zool&gt; Pieman:  I think so

   jcompton&gt; Pieman: I haven't heard anything that specific discussed.  I
            don't see why not, I know of at least two companies who would
            love new units for their own products...

       Zool&gt; Pieman: It makes sense.  Escom wants to get Amiga tech in
            other things than the Amiga computers, so the CD32 would be
            step towards a set top box

   jcompton&gt; Pieman: But again, this is one of those things Escom needs to
            be made aware of.

       Zool&gt; Pieman:  Also, if the Phillipine plant does have 130,000 akiko
            chips in stock, and they buy it, I'm sure Escom will want to
            make CD32s.

       Zool&gt; Pieman:  there is still good profit to be had in CD32s and
            royalties off it.

       Zool&gt; Pieman: It fits with Escom's strategy.

       Zool&gt; GA

   jcompton&gt; Beowulf_'s up.

   Beowulf_&gt; Mention was made of Escom producing the 64 for sale in some
            parts of the world.  Do you know of any plans for 64's to be
            sold in the US (specifically the SX 64)?

   Beowulf_&gt; GA

   jcompton&gt; Beowulf: Again, that's gotta be up to them.  The Chinese
            market seems to be where they want to put the 64-it's cheap to
            make and cheap to buy.  There's always the CMD market in the
            US, but again, Escom may not be aware of that.

       Zool&gt; GA...I have nothing to say.

   jcompton&gt; Beowulf: I, personally, would be surprised.

   jcompton&gt; GA.

   jcompton&gt; So, that brings up jjohnson.

   jjohnson&gt; If C= Uk is a subsidiary (sp?) of C= Intl who was just bought
            by Escom (and the Phillipines plant also), how can those two
            entities not be included with the deal? Thanks. GA

       Zool&gt; jjohnson:  no, C= UK is not part of Escom, but Escom plans to
            buy it in 2 weeks  time.

       Zool&gt; Escom also will probably buy the Phillipines plant.

   jcompton&gt; Good question.  C= UK is DIRECTLY owned by Commodore BV, which
            is in liquidation.  Its trustees objected to the sale of its
            assets through C= International (the Philippines assets and C=
            UK).

   jcompton&gt; C= BV SHOULD have to report to C= International, but because
            of Commodore's convoluted structure...

   jcompton&gt; Zool: The inventory, not the plant.  They don't own the plant.

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  It may be illegal to sell the plant to anyone other
            than Escom, because there may be Amiga tech still in there that
            Escom owns.  That is what the court said.

       oleg&gt; stoopid  question, is the court-approved contract available
            electronically? it is a public document, so it can be
            requested. has anyone done that?

   jcompton&gt; Queue: irc  shadowhawk  bytey  chamer  bandini  frotz  reti032
            golum  number1  wt  kthulu ...

   jcompton&gt; oleg: It's a very LONG public document.  I, for one, don't
            want to type it in.  I'll ask the lawyers on Monday, though.

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  Ofcourse, there are such things as scanners... :)

   jcompton&gt; oleg: You might be able to get it sent to you from the office.

   jcompton&gt; Zool: Which any member of the audience can feel free to buy
            for me.

       oleg&gt; jcompton actually it *should* be available for the cost of
            copying/mailing from the bankruptcy court if it is not
            available from the attorneys

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  :)

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  Maybe a company that makes scanners will be good
            enough to take an ad out in AR, right? 

   jcompton&gt; irc's not here, so shadowhwk's up.

  Shadowhwk&gt; Has any evidence as to whether or not ESCOM has talked to, met
            with or is planning to meet with NewTek?  GA

   jcompton&gt; Zool: I can always hope.

    HammerD&gt; Any mention of C= Canada or other operating subsidaries? Was
            Douglas MacGregor there? (head of C= Canada)

   jcompton&gt; Ok, then, how about bytey?

      bytey&gt; What is Escom's reputation in Germany ? GA

   jcompton&gt; HD: Not clear.

         AK&gt; A Amiga Deal friend of mine has said that NewTek has
            officially stated that the future Amiga is of no concern of
            theirs.

       Zool&gt; Are there any Germans here who have dealt with Escom?  If so,
            /msg Zool so that I can answer bytey

   jcompton&gt; bytey: Like any large company, Escom has its supporters and
            detractors.  On .misc, there's a thread, one person lauds Escom
            for great potential, the other says their service sucks.

    fallous&gt; People are waiting in line for their questions, let's stay
            with the queue

   jcompton&gt; bytey: But they've demonstrated tremendous growth lately, so
            they've got attention on them, and this can't hurt.  So I guess
            the quick answer is: you'll know soon.

   jcompton&gt; Ok, Shadowhwk was lagged, let's try again...

       Zool&gt; bytey:  Willow says that Escom is very big, but doesn't have
            good service.

  Shadowhwk&gt; Has any evidence as to whether or not ESCOM has talked to, met
            with or is planning to meet with NewTek?  GA

       Cryo&gt; there's more to life than NewTek

   jcompton&gt; Shadow: Too specific.  If they have, they haven't made it
            public.

   jcompton&gt; Everyone has to understand...Escom has been incredibly
            secretive over the past months.  We found out more about their
            plans and thought processes today than we did since the rumors
            started spreading in September.

   jcompton&gt; So, any secret deals, meetings, or promises they may have made
            are still total unknowns.

   jcompton&gt; GA

        Nyx&gt; I'd like to mention along with Cryo that NewTek, while being a
            very "public" company in the eyes of the public, never sold
            enough Amigas to keep C= alive.  Commodore survived on the
            low-end machines, and always did.

   jcompton&gt; That'll bring up CHamer.

       oleg&gt; There is a thread on c.g.lightwave (initiated by lee stranahan
            an ex-NewTek employee) that NEwTek is in deep financial
            trouble... Thus they may at least be interested in selling
            Amiga Toasters for a while, if only to liquidate their
            inventory.

        Nyx&gt; The only reason C= had high-end machines at all was for a
            technology proving ground.

       Zool&gt; By the way, people, Willow has told me that service is on of
            Escom's selling points, but that in practice, like Radio Shack,
            it's not very good, because the people don't have the
            expertise.

     CHamer&gt; Thanks. Are there any 'surprise' legal actions on the part of
            the 'un-successful' bidders set to slow this down again? GA

       Zool&gt; CHamer:  No, it seems as if all is smooth saling from here on
            in.

    fallous&gt; Would another op please take over the voicing?  I seem to be
            getting lagged.

   jcompton&gt; CH: Good question.  The only chance would be at the Bahamas
            court, but the court has all but signed in blood that they'll
            say what the US judge said, and he said "yes", so...

   jcompton&gt; Ok, I'll print it when I have it.  In the meantime, reti032 is

       Zool&gt; +49 241 27734  is one of Escom's phone numbers.  Thanks to
            ChrisDi for this.

   jcompton&gt; Answer: I don't see any big changes for AR.  As for conference
            with Escom...that's up to them, but it won't be for lack of
            trying on my part.

            and soundboards like the ibm?  Also I would like to add that
            the Amiga Computer Users of RIT hope that ESCOM will be open to
            suggestions from those of us who use the computer.  I beilieve
            that we need to stay on top of

            are customer service.

       Zool&gt; Thanks Willow for that one.

     Kthulu&gt; of ESCOM so they know what we want and what can be done with
            the AMIGA

     Kthulu&gt; ga

       Zool&gt; Kthulu:  I suppose just call those numbers, at this point.

   jcompton&gt; Kthulu: Another question I'd love to answer, but Escom just
            hasn't given us specific enough information.

       Zool&gt; Kthulu:  However, as I have said, when I talk to Escom again
            in 2 weeks, I will ask about where concerned Amiga users can
            call to voice suggestions.

   jcompton&gt; GA

       Zool&gt; GA

   Cyclone2&gt; How much is Escom planning to put into Amiga R&D?  This is a
            legitimate concern, since C= invested about $30 million a year
            in Amiga R&D, and it wasn't enough.

       Zool&gt; Cyclone2:  It sounds like they are willing to spend a lot.
            They know that the Amiga need new technology upgrades, and that
            it will take a lot of work to incorporate the Power PC into the
            Amiga.

       Cryo&gt; dejag

   jcompton&gt; "As much as they say they will."  As of now, Escom is a &gt;$1
            billion company.  Their clones require far less R+D than the
            Amiga would, and the 64 certainly won't be an engineering
            challenge.

   jcompton&gt; GA.

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  Yes, but if they believe that the Amiga can be a
            viable computer, they will spend on R&D.

   jcompton&gt; Zool: Of course.

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  And Escom did say that they bought it to make
            Amigas, and that they wouldn't have put the time into it
            otherwise, nor the money.

       Zool&gt; Another Escom phone number, this one Germany:  +49 6252 71313 
            Thank ChrisDi for that one!

   jcompton&gt; Zool: I think they could turn a handy profit without the
            Amiga.  In fact, I'll submit that the Amiga is the riskiest
            part of a balanced diet of PC and Mac clones, the 64, and the
            Amiga.

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  They could make a profit without the Amiga, but
            they could make a bigger profit WITh the Amiga.  

       Cryo&gt; if you aren't paying attention, you will lose your slot

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  I believe that they want to revamp the Amiga.  I
            could be very wrong, but that is what they conveued to me.  And
            a revitalized Amiga sold in big computer chains could make
            money.  

   jcompton&gt; Cryo: Some people are lagged, though...we ARE putting a lot of
            load on...

        Nyx&gt; Not unless you can attract big name software vendors as well.

       Zool&gt; Nyx:  Those will come if Escom sells Amigas again, especially
            if they put them in all Escom stores and other big computer
            chains.

   jcompton&gt; Nyx: But, Ken, with you at EA, that shouldn't a problem. :)

        Nyx&gt; Zool: Perhaps in Europe.

       Cryo&gt; chamer: speak or die

     CHamer&gt; When are we going to see some machines appear?

       Zool&gt; I think that Escom should sell cheap A1200s to China, because
            that would really boost the Amiga user market.

       Zool&gt; CHamer:  In 2 months, according to Escom.

       Zool&gt; CHamer:  They already had a deal set up with a Chinese firm to
            make Amigas in their plants.

     CHamer&gt; Is that real, or just 'smoke'?

       mr_t&gt; Have Escom talket with the AmigaOS replacement group? and what
            are their plans for distribution to others than their own
            stores?

   jcompton&gt; Zool: Um, your interview says 3 months.

       Zool&gt; Chamer:  Well, the Chinese were at the hearing, so i assume
            so.

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  [sigh]  That must have been a typo...

       mr_t&gt; How are they going to promote the Amiga vs PC?

   jcompton&gt; mr_t: Another question locked in the brains of many German and
            Dutch execs.  We just don't know yet.

       Zool&gt; mr_t:  Willow informs me that Escom hasn't contacted the Amiga
            OS project.  However, C= Uk did contact the Amiga OS project,
            and Escom will be buying C= UK, so they may contact them
            through C= UK.  GA

      Optic&gt; Will American/Canadian stores be able to sell Amigas, or do
            Escom only sell their products through Escom retail outlets?

   jcompton&gt; GA

       Zool&gt; Optic:  I assume that Escom will sell Amigas everywhere.  It
            makes business sense to sell them in stores other than their
            own, because they can make more profit off the Amiga that way.


       Pala&gt; what did do the amiga director of escom when he was at C=, how
            good how bad ? GA

   jcompton&gt; Zool: That's a pretty simplified view.  Pleasance sent the OS
            people a letter saying "Good work, carry on, we think it's
            neat", but there was no commitment made...

       Zool&gt; Optic:  Ofcourse, that will be a measure of how much they want
            the Amiga to survive.  If they don't allow other stores to have
            it, that's a bad sign.

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  Actually, he said that they were interested in
            talking to them, and that was before they got the Amiga, and
            just that he acknowledges them is a good sign.

   jcompton&gt; Pala: Good question.  I'd never heard of the guy.  

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  I though you knew everything about C=...my
            idolization of you is shattered... :)

   jcompton&gt; Zool: Sorry, CIL management wasn't one of my fortes.

   jcompton&gt; I'd just like to interject that I DO strongly feel that
            Escom's purchase of Commodore's assets seriously imperils the
            future of floor scrubber development.

       mage&gt; From which point would it be realistic to think Escom would
            continue R&D?  Will they start over from scratch, or will they
            keep any of the "old stuff" ?

   jcompton&gt; (It's been asked that I point out that CIL had a good dozen or
            two vice presidents at any given time, so this one was probably
            nothing to wrry about.)

       Zool&gt; I just want to say that although I agree that Escom could turn
            out to be VERY bad, they could also turn out to be VERY good
            for the Amiga.

   jcompton&gt; mage: Well, Amor toyed with the idea of scrapping AAA and
            3DRISC, because the benefit-to-time ratio may not have added
            up.  But it's going to be up to Escom's evaluation.

       Zool&gt; mage:  I don't think we really know.  They could go Power PC
            and, make old software compatible, or they might feel that it
            is easier to start from scratch with the Power PC.

   jcompton&gt; msg rlsayer Reminded me, that is.

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  "saleable"?  :)

            product.

       Cryo&gt; droids: you're on

     droids&gt; Does Escom have a floor scrubber, and do they know how to use
            it?    GA

   jcompton&gt; I like "saleable".

   jcompton&gt; droids: Probably, but unfortuately they haven't admitted it.

       Zool&gt; Also, I think that with Escom, we pretty much have an all or
            nothing venture.  They either are going to kill the Amiga, or
            do great things with it and push it like crazy.

     WilloW&gt; Zool: That's correct. Is a totaly unknown thing. Maybe they
            are worse then C= or ten times better.

      HiDog&gt; Did Escom mention their intended market?  High/low end,
            desktop/console etc.?  I still have a feeling they might just
            milk the Amiga technology as is and eventually kill it i.e.
            cheap settop box...  GA

   jcompton&gt; Any more questions?  We're going to close the queue soon...

   jcompton&gt; Hidog: They mentioned all markets, like the good salesmen they
            had on hand.

       Cryo&gt; tritn, you're on

       Zool&gt; HiDog:  I believe that they want to do low end for new
            markets, like China, but on the other hand, I think they wanted
            to make Amiga business machines for the European market, which
            is very business oriented

      Sudog&gt; How long can we expect to wait (perhaps an estimate?) before
            we see some sort of action in North America? I'm looking for
            general ballpark, not exact figures. So far from what I've
            heard, it doesn't look good for us. Please, your impressions
            would be wlcm.

      Sudog&gt; GA

      Sudog&gt; Wait!

      Sudog&gt; I ask this for the users out ther who have broken Amigas! Like
            broken a4000s.

      Sudog&gt; NOW GA.

   jcompton&gt; sudog: Well, what Giorgio told me about their answer to the US
            distribution question was NOT encouraging.  Their answer was
            "Well, we'll look for the best people", which means "We haven't
            thought about it."

       Zool&gt; Sudog:  Escom said that they want to set up American offices
            soon, and Colin Proudfoot says that Escom wants to use this to
            get into the US market, so I think it looks pretty good.

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  Hmmm...conflicting answers...

       oggy&gt; Escom are breaking into the UK PC market theyve bought up all
            the rumberlow(formaly owned by Thorn Emi) and are opening
            superstores on top of these in the UK, now theyve bought C= and
            say they plan to break into the US market as well, although
            they have..

   jcompton&gt; Zool: Yes, and you were both talking to the same guy...

       Cryo&gt; transcripts will be available on www.warped.com

       oggy&gt; large captial, will it be enough or have they bitten off more
            than they can chew?

       Cryo&gt; uh oh.. guard your sheep.. joec is up

       Zool&gt; jcompton:  perhaps I misunderstood his statement.  However, he
            did say that they were going to be setting up some kind of US
            contact, somehow, and Colin Proudfoot did say that Escom wanted
            to get into the US market.

   jcompton&gt; oggy: Rhetorical question. :)

       Zool&gt; oggy: Escom definitely has the capital to the do whatever they
            want with teh Amiga...

       JoeC&gt; What was Microsoft's objection at the hearing, and who gets to
            pay that old cursor patent fee now from that other company?

   jcompton&gt; Zool: Because as salesmen, they would be committing suicide to
            rule anything out.  That's their job.

   jcompton&gt; JoeC: Microsoft didn't object, they were at the auction as a
            creditor.

       Zool&gt; oggy:  The computer market is growing in Europe, and they are
            positioned to make a nice sum off it.

   jcompton&gt; JoeC: And it will fall on Escom to re-license the CadTrack
            patent, and pay up all of the MANY MANY patents that are "not
            in good standing".

   jcompton&gt; For instance, the CrossDOS license is not in good standing,
            along with hundreds of others.

       Cryo&gt; corinna.. speak

    Corinna&gt; Comment: We need to be positive about the future with Escom,
            being negative will not help anyone, us or them.  This could be
            a whole new era for the Amiga.  KEEP THE FAITH! :)

   jcompton&gt; Interestingly enough, not even Consultron knew it was not in
            good standing...

    Corinna&gt; Thanks to Zool and Jason and all other folks for the info! GA!

       Zool&gt; Corinna:  Thank you!  I think that since we are stuck with
            Escom, we should hope for the best, and wait to see what
            happens.

   jcompton&gt; (The queue is closed)...


      Optic&gt; jc: What about the Amiga speech synth?

   jcompton&gt; I'll agree...but this is also not the time to be complacent. 
            We've been screwed around before, and this last year hasn't
            exactly been fun, so it's worth our while to make DAMN sure
            Escom knows what they have to do.

    Piranha&gt; Since IBM still has patents pending on some of the
            architecture on the Amiga platform, is it *secure* that Escom
            has the technology, or will they end up going to court again?
            This will put our Amiga's out of commission 'again'. Is this
            something we have to worry about?  Go Ahead-GA

   jcompton&gt; Optic: I didn't see it in there, I thought that was a dead
            issue.

       Zool&gt; Piranha: It is secure.

       Zool&gt; Pirahna:  IBM dropped their objection, as far as I understand.


    Drizzit&gt; Will Escom allow ship Amigas with better CPUs with stock
            machines (ie 25,33,&40MHz models) instead of just one (25MHz
            right now)?  And will they move on to the PowerPC, the 060, or
            some other RISC based chip?

   jcompton&gt; Piranha: Unfortunately, the result of IBM's claim was unclear.
            The main problem seems to be that they weren't LISTED as
            holders, making them wonder what the liquidator was trying to
            pull.

   jcompton&gt; Drizzit: We don't know the answer yet.

   jcompton&gt; Piranha: They held a license, not the patents themselves.

       Zool&gt; Drizzit:  The have said that they like the Power PC chip, but
            that no decision has been made yet.

       Cryo&gt; super samarai cybers up

       Cryo&gt; go lighty

     Lighty&gt; The following question is for Zool to include in his next
            interview with Escom:

     Lighty&gt; I realize that the matter has probably not been discussed
            internally yet, but in a future version of the Amiga's OS, do
            they plan to include plan to include internet capabilities?

     Lighty&gt; GE

     Lighty&gt; err...GA

       Zool&gt; Lighty:  OK, I'll ask them that when I next speak to them. 
            Thanks for the suggestion.

       Cryo&gt; tritn: you're on

       Cryo&gt; anyone I miss?

       Cryo&gt; tritn, you type "Hello, I have a question"

   jcompton&gt; If you were missed, let us know now...

       Cryo&gt; no bunghole.. type

       Cryo&gt; type type type type type

      TritN&gt; Hello I have a Question

      TritN&gt; I'm sure I speak on Behalf of many ppl within the large Amiga
            community of Montreal, Quebec. I Must ask, Is there any news
            about distribution in other countries like Canada? (Also please
            comment of fate of C= Canada) GA

       Cryo&gt; there is no hope for some people

       mr_t&gt; Has Escom said anything about what direction the are planning
            on developing hardware and OS (besides setop and PPC)? GA

   jcompton&gt; Tritn: C= Canada was a direct subsidiary of C= International,
            so will be part of Escom.

   jcompton&gt; Tritn:  No news about Canada otherwise, though.

   Fastlane&gt; let me add also with Australia (C=Australia was never any
            good)

       Zool&gt; mr_t:  No.

   jcompton&gt; Ok, it's really closed for real now, no more etc.

   jcompton&gt; mr_t: No, but I'm sure they haven't ruled anything out.

       Cryo&gt; dra: you're up

    Draegon&gt; What kind of support can we posibly expect for older amigas?
            GA...

   jcompton&gt; Draegon: I'd say you should stop hot-swapping joysticks now,
            just in case.

       Cryo&gt; cybers: online

     cybers&gt; can we send a copy of this to Escom?

       Cryo&gt; cybers: yes, with a xerox of my butt

   jcompton&gt; cybers: Yeah, but make it one of the edited ones.

       Cryo&gt; chamer: you're 15 seconds starts now ;-)

     CHamer&gt; Thanks, Are there going to be assurance that while machine
            production ramps up, that parts will become available as well?
            GA

   jcompton&gt; CH: No, there's no assurance of that at all.  This is another
            one of those things Escom won't think of unless they hear
            enough complaints and prodding.

       Cryo&gt; spinner marks the end of the queue

       oleg&gt; zool, who exactly are you, and what relationship, if any do
            you have with ESCOM?

    Spinner&gt; Will the Chinese manufacturer mean cheaper (cost and/or
            quality), more expensive, or similar to current AMigas?

    Spinner&gt; Will we see an A4000 cost competitive to a 486 syustem?  GA.

       Zool&gt; oleg:  I am the Editor-in-Chief of Amiga Link Online Magazine.
            I have no relationship with Escom, except that I talked to them
            today at the hearing.

   jcompton&gt; Spinner: I'm not sure what the relation of
            Chinese-to-Philippines labor costs are, but I'd imagine Chinese
            labor is a few degrees cheaper, at least.

       Cryo&gt; unedited transcripts will be available from www.warped.com..
            edited ones will be elsewhere

       Zool&gt; Spinner:  It will probably mean Slave labor, sadly.

       oleg&gt; zool so why aren't we getting at least some "I don't know
            answers from you"? you CANNOT conceivably have covered every
            question asked here in your talk with ESCOM, soo how much is
            speculation on your part, and how much is ESCOM answers?

       Cryo&gt; thank you all for attending.. we have some entertainment for
           you coming up

       Cryo&gt; We are going to tie jason down and let you all come with your
            cow prods and have at him

   jcompton&gt; Yeah, that about does it for the formal part, everyone.  Thank
            you very much for coming, the official edited transcripts will
            be appearing in the online magazine of your choice...

       Zool&gt; oleg:  I haven't said that because I don't answer what I can't
            answer.  And yes, there is a matter of speculation inveolved,
            but it's the best that I can do with a 3 minute conversation.

      caldi&gt; Cryo: Your butt would be better entertainment, put it in the
            fax machine.

   jcompton&gt; All I have left to say is that I'm not about to watch Escom
            screw this up, so I'd appreciate all the help I can get making
            sure they don't.

   jcompton&gt; Open up the floodgates...

       Cryo&gt; *ding* *ding* *ding* this conference is officially over.

       Zool&gt; oleg:  The best thing Escom said was "We wouldn't have spent 
            million and the time to buy the Amiga unless we wanted to make
            Amigas" 

       Cryo&gt; thanks for attending..
