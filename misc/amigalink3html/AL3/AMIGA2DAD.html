Imaginary Amiga ad #1</TITLE>

     Three passes of some gooey Mac chassis, with triumphant camera angles
 and high contrast shadows cast by two point source lights against a 
 backlit panorama of low hue photographs of apple crates which say
 "mackintosh" on the sides.
 
 
     Round about the middle of the second pass, you notice a blister and
 smoke rising from one side.  As the camera keeps rotating around, you see
 a strong lazer burning a huge hole in from the other side.  With some
 expensive transgressional warp, the camera chases over the beam of the
 lazer to an Amiga and the source, with a moving quote of "Since you saw
 your first lazer show at an amusement park you have seen what only the
 Amiga can do." read by some smoker-voice talent. Camera dips into the beam
 and flash cuts to a digitally generated "sea" of IBM PC-compatibles
 undulating calmly.  After a few oscillations, the sea is torn through
 perpendicularly by a rocket, blurring the scene with a "heat wave" 
 visual effect.
 
 
     In blackness, that same cancer-victim voice talent says "For 35 years
 there has been a cesspool of mediocrity in the world of personal
 computers. Fortunately for you, the universe is a very big place."  At
 this point, a well-rendered starfield has been faded in slowly.  The
 camera moves, banking to an angle perpendicular and up from the current
 view-point.  It follows this current direction and accelerates fast enough
 to turn the stars into rainbow lines (ala star Trek and laws of physics)
 with a triumphant musical arrangement lasting only a few seconds, the warp
 effect stops at a large black sphere blocking all but the outermost stars
 in view.  The sphere rotates and light is cast upon a planetary boing
 ball.
 
                              Words are overlayed:
                              
                              
                                   "Amiga"
                              "You can join us."
                                  "Be Free."
