The news this month comes direct from the European Computer Trade Show, where Commodore showed off their newest products.  The information that follows is no longer speculation.  It is now factual.  The products exist, and are ready for distribution.

@node a1200 "CD For Your A1200"

Along with the A4000/040 Tower, the prototype CD Rom drive for the A1200, took pride of place in the Commodore Suite at the ECTS.  It will allow A1200 owners to access the growing number of CD32 titles that are becomming available on the market at the present time.  

In design and size, the unit looks much like the drive of the CD32, just without the right hand side of the machine where the FMV module is housed.The unit is in the colours of the A1200, and all of the expected connectors are there, including a controller connector, which is obviously needed to accomodate the 11 button pad.

However.  There are many problems at the moment, which has caused Commodore UK to not set a date for the units release.  These are :-

            1) The cable that attaches the unit to the A1200, feeds through the small slot at the back, right hand side of the machine.  It then attaches to the internal expansion slot, which, as feared, prevents other expansions from being attached.  
            2) Due to the method of attachment, it is impossible to have RAM upgrades other than by the use of the PCMCIA slot.  Unfortunatley, most of the games tried on the unit with the credit card RAM did not run.  C= are adamant that this problem will be fixed before any units are shipped.
            3) Finally, but probably most importantly, the drive will definately not be FMV compatible.


Projected price is set at 200, but whether it will ever be released in the UK has yet to be seen.  The incompatability and non FMV capability will probably result in not many units ever being sold.  Anybody wanting such a machine would be much better off buying a CD32 with the forthcoming SX1 expansion slot.
If you are dead set on getting your hands on a CD1200, then your best bet is to try to get a grey import from Germany, where the drive is due for release.

What is really needed though is a PCMCIA drive, with FMV capabiltity.  The only other company that seemed innovative enough to produce such a device was Software Demon (UK), and it has come to light that they have gone bust.  So, we can now only wait to see what the future holds.

@node fmv "The FMV/MPEG Module!"

At long last, the CD32's FMV module is back on the market, although it still does not come with a demonstration disk.  However Adamski's Killer video is on Commodores latest demo disk, so if you can convince your local dealer to supply you with a copy, you can see some high quality FMV that complies with White Book Standard, unlike the CD-I titles presently available.  The audio quality is not as good as it could be, but it's still good to see.
@endnode
@node maga "CD32 Magazines"

There are now three magazines available in the UK specifically for the CD32.  These are :-

                   Amiga CD    3.95    (With AUI)
                   Amiga CD32  4.95    (By Future Publishing (AFormat)
                   CD32 Gamer  3.99    (By The Edge)

    all come with a supplied CD, but so far, the best one has proved to be Amiga CD, and that doesn't even come as a dedicated magazine.  It is attached to the front of Amiga User International.  Traditionally, AUI has been very slow with it's reviews of games, but hopefully that will not be the case with Amiga CD.  As a disk based magazine it has a lot of good qualities, but is unfortuanately let down by it's editor, who is a total pratt.

Amiga CD32 and CD32 Gamer, both take the same approach to the subject, with a totally games based CD and magazine.  CD32 Gamer is very sparse news wise, whereas Amiga CD32 does have quite a large news and interviews section.  They are both quite thin, which is a bit of a dissapointment considering their prices, especially in Amiga CD32's case.

None of the magazines have FMV on their disks, which is a bit of a dissapointment.  All of the reviews on Amiga CD are done with CDXL, and there is no reason why the producers could not put proper FMV on the disk in addition to the CDXL.  The space is definately there.  they just don't think that the user base is present.  For this reason, I would like to find out how many people have the MPEG module.  If you do, could you please send E-Mail to jwwright@cix.compulink.co.uk with "I Have FMV" in the subject line.  Cheers.

Final comment on CD based magazines:

                                     Amiga CD32.  It has a really annoying feature, where to run games, you have to reboot the machine, and hold down one of the controller buttons.  Arghhhhhh!

                                     CD32 Gamer.  A lot of the PD games on the disk need a keyboard and a mouse, which will be a problem to a lot of people.

                                     Amiga CD.    Always has listings in the magazine of the things which are on the disk.  When you actually run the disk, half of the stuff is not actually there.   Very naughty.

@node revi " Reviews Of The Latest Games To Hit The CD32 "


The following reviews are for games that are available at the present time.  That is, you should be able to get them in any high street shop.  At long last, the software base for the CD32 has reached a number that does the machine credit.  

The CD32 now has more games titles available for it, than any other CDROM based machine.  Many people have complained that a great amount of the titles are direct floppy ports and show no innovation.  However, surely it is better that the format has games for it's users to buy, rather than to be in a position where very few games are available, even if they are of very high quality (As in CDO's case).

The Amiga has always had a large catalogue of titles which, with minor enhancements, could justify the CD format, and these will be essential to sell machines until CD specific titles can be produced.  Just ask yourself this.  Would you rather opt for a machine with a large catalogue of good titles, or would you be content with a machine that has maybe five games for it of very high quality.  All new CD based machines will suffer an initial software problem which is inevitable when a new product is released, but in time the quality titles will appear, and you will look back and wonder what the fuss was about.  If these games were not released, you would only have the task of deciding between Microcosm, Liberation, Labyrinth Of Time and Trivial Pursuit.

So this is for all of you sceptics out there!!  Get off your high horse, and stop knocking the machine.  At the present time, it has no competition, yet people are still comparing it to products that don't even exist yet.  How on Earth can you justify the constant media attention saying things like, "But how will it stand up against the Saturn, PS-X or Jaguar CD."  Who cares.  The products are still on the drawing board.  When, or if they ever are released, we will cross that path, but until then, why don't they just let it lie!!

            Brutal Sports Football          Millenium           30

A sideways scrolling ball game, much in the style of SpeedBall 2.  The purpose of the game being to score goals against your opponent whilst beating the hell out of them.  There are no enhancements over the floppy version, apart from the music, and as with any game that requires precise control, the CD32 controller lets it down.  Still a load of fun though!!

Beavers         ?           30

This is a scroll along platformer that will leave you very frustrated within seconds of putting it in your machine.  Due to the screen constantly scrolling to the right, if you stop at all, you will die whe the screen catches up to you.  The object seems to be to collect stars as the level procedes, and this is hampered by the constant onslaught of obstacles and baddies which are impossible to get away from as you try to avoid the screen catching you.  It's only redeeming features are it's graphics and the wonderful intro music.

@node chao "Chaos Engine"

            Chaos Engine            Renegade            25

The Chaos Engine was destined to be a sure fire hit on the Amiga from the moment it was released, and that trend is set to continue with it's release for the CD32.  The game is AGA enhanced with some really good soundtracks, although the introduction is nothing special.  
If you have never seen the game before, it is viewed from above in Alien Breed style, and the object of the game is to run around with your partner (who can be human or computer controlled), shooting badies, collecting keys and powerups, and solving tasks to open gates.  The game is loads of fun, and will keep you occupied for hours.
At twenty-five quid, the game is well worth the money, or if you buy a CD32 now, it comes free, with Microcosm in the new pack.

You are Bubba, and your job is to get to the end of each mayhem filled level armed only with your stick to defend yourself with.  Along your journey there are many problems to solve, the answer to all of which, lies in your stick, which has many uses.  You can throw, climb, open and even whack things with it, and rest assured, all of the stix uses are essential to complete the levels.

This game mixes both the platform and puzzle game genres together very well.  The combination of which makes the game very entertaining.  The AGA cartoon graphics and sound are gorgeous, and loading of the levels is instantaneous.  The levels are also easily accessed by a password system, which a godsend to the very limited battery save of the CD32.

All these factors combine together to make Bubba 'N Stix one of the best CD32 games available.  If you enjoy platform games, you MUST but this!!!!

Well, it's cheap!!, but that's all you can really say about this now very out of date turkey.  The gameplay is very average for a platformer, and there are no obvious enhancements over the A500 version.  This, and the matter of not having a save game option limit's it's appeal, and for this reason is unlikely to hold your attention for any period of time.

        Defender Of The Crown 2         Commodore           27

This is basically a graphical adventure with interspersed action sequences.  Set in medieval England, your task is to defeat all of your opponents and make enough money to pay King Richards ramsome.  It features nice graphics and has sampled speech throughout.  The monotony of some of the decision making is broken by action sequences, which involving you fighting, defending your castle and joining in with sporting events such as jousting.  However, the routine of the game becomes very annoying after a while and when you have seen all of the action scenes, there is little to do.  If you like this sort of game, it is a much better choice then Castles 2 which is in a similair style, (reviewed last month) and relally does make use of the CD media.

Oh dear, another Ocean film tie-in, and we all know what that means don't we??

CRAP!!!.  Yes, they've done it again.  Another huge turkey under Ocean's belt.  This is a direct port of the floppy version given away with the A1200 Desktop Dynamite package, and thus it is just as bad.  It was hard enough to play with a proper joystick/pad, but with the CD32 controller, it is absolutely impossible.  To add to this, collision detection is awful, and the sprites are very badly drawn.   30 quid, they're having a laugh!!!  Avoid at all costs.

This is a graphically superb, horizontal shoot-em-up game, much like R-Type, and the brilliant Project-X.  The original game was slated for being far to hard, but apparantly, the difficulty level has been toned down for the CD release.  However, I still found it extremely hard, but that could just be me.  Along with the standard shooting, there are shops along the way where you can buy various power-up's and better weapons.
In summary, you could do worse than to buy this, but for the money, you might as well get Project-X, with F17 Challenge thrown in.

Whoops, there goes another wasted 30 pounds.  The CD version has more levels, and more colour than the original disk version, but it is by no means a saving grace.  The control method is very difficult to master, and the game has no strategy element at all.  You just walk around, and shoot, or stab people.  That's it, and to top it all of, it's just sooooo sloooooooow!!

Hmmmmm, here's a strange one.  I hated the floppy version of this game because of it's difficulty level, and all of the really annoying bugs that it had.  Great things were expected of this for it's release onto CD32, but unfortunately, it fails miserably.  There was the promise of texture mapped ships that were set to be the major selling point, increased interactivity with other characters and all of the bug's were supposed to be fixed.  However, this is a direct floppy port, complete with the original problems.  The conversion to the CD32 controller is absolutely terrible, and it takes ages to do anything.  If you are desperate enough to pay 30 for this, you really ought to get a mouse at the same time if you do not already have one.  A bit of a turkey really, don't believe the hype!!!

When you put this in your machine, you will first be greated with a cutesy intro, which is quite nice.  Things stay in a similair manner during the game.  You control a very small ball of fluff with eyes, and the object of the game is to romp around the puzzle ridden platforms collecting jewels.  At any time during the game you can change into one of another three furries, all of which have specific features which will allow you to get past blockages.  With the various other furries, you can chew through blocks, climb with a rope, shoot fire, and jump extra high.  Now, this all sounds very nice doesn't it?  Well, it is, until you try to play it for any length of time.  The main sprites are far too small, and the method used to control them is little short of abysmal.  You seem to always find yourself falling off things when the inertia fails.  All this aside, if you like a challenge, this should keep you occupied for a while.

Nice graphics, shame about the game.  In a style similair to that of game like Civilization, the object is to defeat your opponents while trying not to destroy the planet too much.  It is practically impossible to play this with a pad, so connect the mouse straight away.  Anyway, the actual game.  Well, it's far to complex and involved.  It's not the sort of thing that you could casually play, and for this reason, probably wont get you hooked fast enough to even want to.  The intentions seem to have been there, but the finished product has failed miserably.

Well, it's a bit steep, and unlikely to sell in any great quantities, but here we go.  This disk contains 21 Encyclopaedia volumes, complete with pictures and sound totalling just over 400Mb.  Everything that you could possibly ever want to know is here, plus lot's that you probably wouldn't.  As a CD32 product, it's pretty much pointless, but when the 1200 and 4000 CDRom drives become available, it could be a big seller.

This is unforgiveable.  This is the floppy version released way back in 1988, and as far as I can see, there are no enhancements at all.  The gameplay is as bad as ever, and no matter how hard you try, the moves you try to make always turn out as something else.  You end up in a mad frenzy of button pressing on the controller.  Only one for the old timers trying to regain their youth!!

If you didn't get this game free with your CD32, then don't bother.  Garish overcoloured graphics and useless controls let this promising title down badly.  If you are after a colourful platformer, then Trolls (reviewed last month).  It's just the same, but with slightly better gameplay.

                    Prey            Almathera           30

After a very impressive intro, you meet a graphically superb game with good sounds, but naff gameplay.  Basically, the plot is exactly the same as Aliens, but far less suspenseful (Is that a word?).  The game get's really annoying once you have died about ten times and besides, who wants to play a CDTV game on their lovlely CD32.  Forget it!!

@node prem "Premiere"

Premiere            Core Design         30

This is an exact coversion from floppy.  I was informed that it has AGA graphics, but I would question that.  If you havn't seen it, you play a stage hand, who's job it is to go through the various film sets collecting oscar's and wiping out baddies.  The control method is simple, and the game quite absorbing.  You could do far worse than to buy this.  It will keep you busy for a long while.  The only major problem I have is that the intro, which was impressive on floppy, just doesn't cut it on CD.

                7 Gates Of Jambala          Unique          30

Hooray, at last an absolutely brilliant game for the CD32.  ONLY JOKING.  I thought that the last release from Unique was bad (Chambers Of Shaolin, reviewed last issue), but this takes the prize.  It is the biggest pile of dung that I have ever seen.  I am not even going to bother to talk about it.  It's that bad.

                Summer Olympix          Flair           30

Cartoon style graphics and the old Daley Thopsons Decathlon control method combine to make this game one to play when you have had a few beers.  It's main purpose, I am sure, is to destroy the CD32 controller which can't be a bad thing, can it?  The bog standard sound is forgiveable, because the game offers amazing playability, and you will be shouting so much that you won't hear it.  The only major pitfall with this game is the one player option.  It's very boring.  Get the drink in, and play agaist a mate!!!  Pure enjoyment.

@node tota "Total Carnage"

                Total Carnage           ICE         30

An exact copy of the crappy original.  Useless control method, awful sound, abysmal graphics and all around unplayability make this game destined for the bin.  It even put's a message on screen that say's "Loading and Decrunching".  Surely not???  Is there something that I have missed??  Obviously the game uses the full 650Mb and has to be crunched to fit on the millions of levels.  I don't think so.  It's just useless programming and general laziness on ICE's part.  Don't you dare buy this.

@node micr "Microcosm!!!"

These tips and cheats for @{fg highlight}@{b}MICROCOSM@{fg text}@{ub} were submitted to CD32 bits by:-

         Stefan E. Fischer, Germany   (rwx031@btw6x1.oec.uni-bayreyth.de)


1. There are two introduction sequences available, depending whether you hit    the RED or GREEN button.
2. It seems that Psygnosis has put some music on the CD not used in MICROCOSM.
   Just try track 2 from the game CD on your audio CD player.
3. Sometimes you need to warp back to a junction because you took the wrong
   branch or because of an endless loop you are flying in.
   Just move to the map and place the outlined rectangle to the red mark you
   want to warp to (place it with the YELLOW or BLUE button). 
   To actually warp press the GREEN button while you are on the map.
4. There is a nice and simple cheat, something similar to Senso.
   Press PAUSE after the game started and try the 4 colored buttons.
   If you hear a higher tone you hit the first button in one of the following
   combinations, now press the remaining buttons.

      GREEN - BLUE - YELLOW - RED - YELLOW- DOWN - GREEN - RIGHT- RED - UP
                                     OR!
     RED - GREEN - BLUE - YELLOW - DOWN - DOWN - BLUE - DOWN - RIGHT - BLUE
                                     OR!
                  YELLOW - RED - GREEN - BLUE - UP - LEFT
                                     OR!
                 BLUE - YELLOW - RED - GREEN - BLUE - LEFT

   You will hear some sound and from now on your life never ends and you have
   access to the right brain with all weapons available, but all rendered
   sequences will appear grey shaded only.

@node robo "Robocod Cheat!"

From: fbotton@cix.compulink.co.uk

At the start of the level, up and to the right, there are some objects... You should spell CHEAT backwards (TAEHC) jumping on the objects beginning with the corresponding letter... Trip, Apple, Earth, Hammer and Cake...  Note that the invincibility does not guarantee falls etc, so you_can_die... for sure...

Also if you attach a keyboard and type "thanks wayne" of "the little mermaid" on the title screen, you can access a map screen (M) and do other things with the F-Keys

Cheers Fred!

@node deep "Deep Core Cheat!!"

From: fbotton@cix.compulink.co.uk

During the game, press the four colour buttons at once, then forward and reverse at once, then the green, yellow and blue... You should be rewarded by a sound ;-) Now press all the coloured buttons at once to skip levels... This must be a cheat mode made for mutants fitted with 12 fingers per hand ;-)

Cheers Fred!

@node digg "Diggers Cheat!"

From: fbotton@cix.compulink.co.uk

Start the game, choose a character, search for FUJALE on the map, push red button, search for CHOSKEE, press red button, search for DEENA, press red button and you should hear a noise indicating you've gained the access to all levels.

Cheers Fred!
