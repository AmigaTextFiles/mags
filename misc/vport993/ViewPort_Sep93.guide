                             Film at Eleven
               The World of Commodore-Amiga '93 - Prologue
                              by @{" Jim Meyer " link jim}

Question: What do you do after your company has suffered through a brutal
year, posted staggering losses, has laid off some of its best people, and
has seen its market value slashed?

Answer:  You throw a party!

And that's exactly what Commodore did.  The big attraction at the World of
Commodore-Amiga was the newest member of the Amiga family, the Amiga CD32,
and all the major players were on hand to show it and to talk about it.
WoCA '93 was in stark contrast to the party just a year earlier, which
introduced the Amiga 4000 and AGA to the world.  Last year's show was
marked by heightened expectations and a sense of renewal.  This year, more
than a few exhibitors talked about going to WoCA for "one last party."
And more than a few exhibitors stayed home, too.  Expectations were low,
and I suspect that many attendees went with the feeling that this would be
the last World of Commodore-Amiga show, ever.

Amiga watchers could see the difference just by chatting with the
Commodore/Amiga Alumni.  Dale Luck - one of the original employees of
Amiga, Inc. - was there, as were Andy Finkel and Hedley Davis.  But this
time, all of them were there merely as observers.  They all now work for
3D0, a company that might better be described as Amiga-in-Exile.  And
CD32?  Well, the common wisdom was that it was nothing more than a
warmed-over CDTV, another colossal flop-to-be, yet another example of
Inept Commodore in action.

Things change.  First, there was the press conference to announce CD32,
such as it was.  Commodore's press conferences tend to attract less of the
"traditional" press and more of the "Amiga rabble," who have learned that
it's not difficult to obtain the yellow Press badge.  And more than a few
of the latter arrived with chips on their shoulders, quite prepared to be
underwhelmed by Amiga CD32.  Despite this, Jim Dionne - President and
General Manager of Commodore Business Machines, Inc. - gamely proceeded
with his presentation, followed by Lew Eggebrecht - Vice President of
Engineering - and John Campbell, from CATS.

Words are one thing.  Most of us already knew about CD32, and were quite
prepared for a lackluster recital of familiar specifications and the usual
rosy expectations.  Indeed, the room sat gamely through Jim Dionne's talk.
He said nothing about the sky falling, but talked instead about the
success of the A1200, his hopes for CD32, and his anticipation that
Commodore's supply problems with the A1200 and A4000 would be solved by
September.  Everyone's ears perked up a little when Lew Eggebrecht went
through the technical details, and touched upon future issues like the AAA
chipset, Retargetable Graphics, and RISC-based Amigas.

And then came @{" The Machine. " system "$viewer cd32"}  First, John Campbell showed a "flight
simulator" - actually an airline cockpit overlaying a flight through a
lush VistaPro landscape.  Then came a bit of Jim Sachs animation,
including a submarine wending its way through an undersea canyon,
accompanied by a 16-bit CD score.  And then came the Jurassic Park demo,
complete with CDXL-animated clips from the movie, and - again - a lush
soundtrack.  Finally, for the few disbelievers left, John played a Bon
Jovi music video, at full 30 frames-per-second speed and with full stereo
sound, thanks to the MPEG card.  They had to pick up the dropped jaws with
a snow shovel.

             World of Commodore-Amiga '93 - The Play Unfolds

                              by @{" Jim Meyer " link jim }

Attendees of last year's World of Commodore-Amiga knew that the real
action wasn't on the floor, but at the Keynote speeches by Jim Dionne and
Lew Eggebrecht.  It was one year ago that Eggebrecht shocked everyone in
attendance by revealing exactly what Commodore's plans were for the Amiga
line and the technology behind it.  The Keynote was THE hot event of the
show, and the hall was packed.

Jim Dionne won the audience over when, after having trouble with his mike,
he quipped "This thing is as hard to use as a DOS machine!" After
proclaiming his bravery by noting the lack of chicken wire in front of the
stage, Dionne recounted the painful facts of a year that was bad not just
for Commodore, but for the entire computer industry.  Commodore, he wryly
noted, had "led the way" by announcing massive losses and restructuring
ahead of Apple and IBM.

The "bad medicine," as Dionne called it, is behind Commodore now.  After
closing out a dismal year, the US operation - starting out on with a clean
slate - will make "an appreciable profit" this quarter.  Dionne noted that
the decisions he had to make, although painful and disagreeable to many
end-users, resulted in a "much stronger Commodore."

This new "streamlined" Commodore has adjusted to the realities of the
marketplace and is now designed to make a profit with far fewer sales, in
dollar terms.  Among the changes have been significant reductions in
staff, an overhaul of distribution (instead of shipping to 180 direct
dealers, Commodore will use 5 distributors), and a new, more efficient
manufacturing facility in the Philippines which replaces facilities in the
US, Taiwan, and Germany.  Dionne expressed the opinion that the "new"
Commodore would be in a stronger position and would continue to bring out
"new and innovative" products.

The restructuring did not go smoothly at first, as Dionne freely admitted.
There were significant problems when Commodore outsourced its service
program, as a number of users know first-hand, and the new factory was
much more difficult to bring online than Commodore had hoped.
 However, Dionne stated that the problems were behind them, and that the
supply of the popular A1200 and A4000 machines should return to normal in
September.  Dionne further stated that by outsourcing such things as
distribution, warehousing, and servicing, Commodore would better be able
to concentrate on the task of building computers.

Dionne went on to describe CD32 and Commodore's plans for its launch, and
then introduced Lew Eggebrecht.  After describing the development of CD32,
its capabilities, and Commodore's intentions regarding its future,
Eggebrecht dropped the bombshell:  The AAA chipset had been cast in
silicon!  Although it was only the first prototype, the AAA crew was able
to blit objects and bring up "true-color" 24-bit screens.  There was, it
seemed, hope for the future after all.

One of the most pleasant things about listening to Eggebrecht speak is the
fact that you rarely have to read between the lines.  When asked about the
possibility of retrofitting the A3000 for AGA, he said that it just wasn't
possible, due to too many electrical differences.  And as for upgrading
the A4000 to AAA?  That was a definite possibility, but would require a
motherboard swap.

Eggebrecht said that Commodore had been actively researching RISC
technology for next-generation Amigas, and also because "we need it to
support a wide array of (possibly non-AmigaDOS) software."  While
Commodore has not yet selected a RISC chip, Eggebrecht flatly stated that
they would be going RISC.  But that doesn't necessarily mean the end of
the Motorola family.  Eggebrecht mentioned that Motorola had a large group
still working on the 68000 family, and that there would be "dramatic
advances" in the future.

I was able to sit down with Jim Dionne after the keynote and ask him about
a wide variety of issues.  Principal among these was how Commodore
expected to make CD32 a success, given the failure of CDTV.  Dionne freely
admitted the mistakes of CDTV - too high a price, sub-par performance, and
too little advertising - and said that they had learned from that
experience.  CD32, he believes, is priced right at $399, and offers the
best mix of features for the price.

But what about advertising?  That's where the European launch comes into
play.  According to Dionne, it costs 10 times as much to market a product
in the U.S. than it does in Europe, for the same number of sales.  Given
that fact, plus favorable name recognition, Europe was ideal for the
launch.  Commodore can "ramp up" sales much more quickly in Europe, Dionne
said.  And the profit from European sales will be plowed back into the
American CD32 campaign, due to start with a "big splash" at the CES show
in January.

Fair enough, but what happens if CD32 is a runaway hit?  Would Commodore
drop the Amiga in a heartbeat?  Not a chance.  Dionne explained that the
profit margin on a CD32 is minuscule compared to the 4000.  The real
intent of this exercise is to sell more 1200s and 4000s.  How?  Commodore
feels that consumers, once they experience the Amiga CD32, will come away
with a favorable impression.  "We're hoping that they'll try the CD32 and
say 'If that's what their games console can do, I wonder about their
computers'", said Dionne.

Commodore realizes that it's a tough row to hoe, that the Amiga "faithful"
will always be skeptical.  Irving Gould, CEO of Commodore, International,
once said of Amiga fans "If they saw me walk on water, they'd say I was
afraid to get wet."  But it looks like they're trying, anyway. And is
Dionne afraid of the competition?  Nope.  He said that he hoped 3D0 would
be released, and that he expected the price to gradually fall, $100 at a
time.  But 3D0, he said, would "educate the public" about a CD games
console.  And he's confident that CD32 will only benefit.

I asked about the layoffs, and what he was doing to improve morale.  The
layoffs, he said, were painful but were a necessary evil.  "We got rid of
the deadwood a long time ago," Dionne continued, "so all the people we had
to let go of were good people."  And morale?  Commodore has already hired
back some of the recently-departed, and the European success of CD32 can't
help but cheer the remaining troops.

@{" Jim Dionne " system "$viewer dionne"}, alas, won't be among the remaining.  Despite his 15 years at
Commodore ("I like pain," he said, with at least a trace of sarcasm), we
received late word (unconfirmed by Commodore) that he had tendered his
resignation.  Perhaps he had finally had his fill of the tight-fisted
refusal of Mehdi Ali to spend a dime to promote the Amiga. Perhaps it was
something else.  Ironically, Dionne leaves just as the U.S. operation
returned to profitability.  We wish his successor luck, but we wonder how
much longer Commodore can continue - or continue to flounder - with Ali at
the helm.

I walked away from the keynote speech and the interview - not knowing that
Dionne wouldn't be back - feeling differently about the future of
Commodore and the Amiga.  The marketing plan for CD32 is as sensible as
any I've heard.  And the machine itself is much more impressive than the
statistics indicate.  But most of all, it seems like the company has a
clear sense of direction and the determination to pursue the course of
innovation that brought us the Amiga.  This may well be the "new
Commodore" we've hoped for.  Much, however, depends on Dionne's successor,
and much depends upon the upper echelon - Henri Rubin, Mehdi Ali, and
Irving Gould.  Have these leopards truly changed their spots?

                The World of Commodore-Amiga '93, Take 1
                              by @{" Nick Cook " link nick }

Apparently nobody told the folks crowding Pasadena's World of Commodore
Amiga that the Amiga is precariously perched at the edge of the extinction
abyss. The vendor demonstration areas were standing room only and
navigating the floor required more than a few "excuse me...excuse
me..excuse me..."s by early afternoon. The Amiga's current market position
was also evident, with most of the 40 plus exhibitors displaying graphics,
video, or multimedia wares.

In Commodore's spacious booth, curious onlookers four or five deep
clustered around the three displayed CD^32s. "Jurassic Park", featuring
clips from the film, ran on one machine, a football simulation, including
digitized TV announcers, played on a second CD^32, while an arcade
platform game bounced around on the third. While the quality of the clips
won't be mistaken for "real" video, they're better than what's currently
on game machines. Commodore also displayed the complete Amiga line,
including the yet-to-be-released 4000 tower.

Soft-Logik Publishing performed hourly demonstrations on its coming DTP
powerhouse, PageStream 3.0. Comparison to programs available on the Amiga
and other platforms, spelled out in small print on a four page flyer,
can't be reviewed here, but some features jumped out at me. Full color bit
map pictures are now supported, and text can "flow" around irregularly
shaped graphics. The graphics and text import features perform double
duty: they translate and export in other formats. For example, import a
TIFF graphic, export it as an IFF; import WordPerfect, export as Final
Copy. PageStream hosts many features which may not be exactly earth
shaking, but will save a heck of a lot of time. These include a bunch of
automatic functions: paragraph bullets, drop caps, backup, hypenation and
kerning. Creating AREXX macros couldn't be simplier: turn on "Record",
perform whatever keystrokes/actions desired, then turn off "Record".
Viola! Instant AREXX script! You can even edit it. Like the famous battery
bunny, PageStream's features go on and on and on... Shipping date is
projected to be no later than mid November.

The number of graphic boards available for the Amiga are increasing,
giving owners of A2000s and A3000s a method to upgraded their systems
without having to buy new machines. The Retina board, a 24 bit display
board which includes Workbench emulation, an optional 1084 monitor
adapter, and AGA emulation, was on display at the MacroSystems US booth.
Two new boards have entered the fray. The Piccolo board from DKB offers
True 16 and 24 bit modes, fully programmable resolutions from 320X200 to
1280 X 1024, double buffering, an optional video module and a single
monitor system with automatic monitor switching, among other things.
Expert Services had Picasso II, billed as the first retargetable graphics
board for the Amiga. The Picasso does not require chip RAM, emulates AGA
chip sets and Workbench, and contains its own on-board blitter. 24 bit
graphics are available in resolutions up to 800 x 768, and the board
supports 256 color Intuition screens up to 1280 x 1024. Centaur
Development's demonstrations of OpalVision pulled in the crowds at its
large booth situated by the shows entrance. The much talked about, but
delayed, Video Modules for OpalVision were previewed in seminars.


Scala presented seemingly continuous (at least the same guy was talking
every time I walked by!) demonstrations of their MM300 multimedia creation
program. This program allows the user to resize freely imported brushes,
and includes an "optimize" function that automatically calculates the best
palette for a page after several different brushes, pictures and text
colors have been used on that page. MM300 offers new wipes, including the
intrigingly named "Nuclear". Just when you thought the Cold War was over.
Text now can "crawl" from the screen without dragging the background with
it. Sound samples load directly from the hard disk, limited sample size to
disk space, not RAM. Although not displayed at the show, Scala's
InfoChannel IC500 will "broadcast" presentations across multiple screens,
and will let these be updated without interrupting playback.

VideoStage Pro, from Oxxi, creates presentations to run on kiosks, for use
in training, or even for video catalogs. Along with the expected funtions,
VideoStage permits animation of individual characters, lines of text or
blocks of text using any Amiga fonts, including compugraphic fonts. An
interesting feature is the "Hot Test". This checks for illegal video
colors that would bleed in NTSC or PAL, then allows the user to adjust the
color levels. VideoStage Pro includes remote control, not only through
Arexx, but also via modems and networks. The program checks for time and
date changes, and then loads new file versions automatically. Great way
for easy updates.

Creative Computers and Century Computer Systems did brisk business selling
all manner of Amiga hardware and software. Public domain libraries stocked
disks and videotapes. Along with its line of disk collections, Premier
Software's booth displayed a special "collectible" Amiga: a 2000 signed by
Jay Miner! DevWare featured its line of instructional video tapes and low-
cost, high featured software. Several Amigas demonstrated titles including
the music creator "OctaMED Professional", an easy to learn morphing and
image warping application called "Cocoon", and the authoring program
"Helm". NorthWest Public Domain offered choices from its over 3000 disk
library, as well as its exclusive double CDTV set of British public domain
titles.

Jim Drew and his Emplant consistently drew a crowd around the Utilities
Unlimited booth. The Amiga/Mac emulation ran side by side to a regular Mac
to allow for direct comparisons. The show even presented hardware to allow
the Amiga to emulate an Amiga! Warm and Fuzzy Logic, Inc. (bonus points
for the best company name) introduced "LightRave", a hardware Toaster
emulator which allows NewTek's Lightwave 3.D to run on a Toaster-less
Amiga. Renderings can be output to 24 bit cards, Amiga and Amiga AGA
displays. LightRave can be networked with ParNet or Ethernet. A newcomer
to the show from the PC and Mac world was Fargo Electronics. They showed
off the Primera, an under $1000 (well, OK, $995) thermal transfer color
printer which can be upgraded into an "advanced dye-sublimation" color
printer. I'm sure somebody out there understands what the heck that is.
All I can say is the Primera sure printed out purty pictures!

Sunrize Industries demonstrated version 3 of its Studio 16 board. This
hummer includes complete 8 track stereo, 16-bit audio editing using a
graphic interface time cue list. You can make non-linear sound edits and
adjust fades and cross-fades by using your mouse. A definite step up from
cueing audio tape!

GVP's booth featured Warner Brothers animator Rusty Mills, who explained
how GVP's ImageFX is used in the creation of the new cartoon show
"Animanics". He stated that the Amiga was somewhat easier to use than the
Mac, since the Amiga's output is RGB and the output can be networked
straight to the SGI-controlled film recorder. The Mac output has to go
through the additional step of translated its output from PIC format to
RGB. An Animanics cartoon was  screened. It was hilarious; the style
managed to recapture the off-the-wall humor of those great 1930s and 1940s
Looney Tunes. Suffice to say that the plot managed to roll Kirk Douglas,
Steven Spielberg, the Sistine Chapel, and ET into one deranged bundle.

Mashing animations down to a more manageable size was tackled by Heifner
Communications, Inc. They showed off their automated JPEG program
"Pegger". The program runs in the background and can compress 30 plus high
resolution video frames on a single floppy. Heifner also displayed their
Toaster Cozy which now operates on the A4000.

Animation software from Axiom (Pixel3D), and Terra Nova Development (Magic
Lantern) was on view. Terra Nova also stopped traffic with "The Labyrinth
of Time", a CD-ROM game (running here on a CDTV) which features over 280
rooms, a 30 minute soundtrack and over 180MB of ray-traced images.

The print media was in attendance. Booths sold subscriptions to Amiga
World, Desktop Video, Amazing Amiga, and Video Toaster User. Merrill
Callaway autographed copies of his "Arexx Cookbook". International
Networking Corporation displayed its range of British imported Amiga help
books.

Phew! And there was more! I left the World of Commodore Amiga, tired, with
a lighter wallet and a bag of goodies including brand new Picasso II
board. I don't want to be Candide, and proclaim "this is the best of all
possible worlds." But when I got home, I patted my trusty A3000. There
still a lot of life in the old girl yet.

                The World of Commodore-Amiga '93 - Take 2
                            by @{" Matt Davidian " link matt }

If anyone tells you that the Amiga is dying, then they haven't been to a
World of Commodore show recently.  Even with Commodore's recent financial
problems, the level of enthusiam at the World of Commodore in Pasadena was
comparable to a year ago.

A year ago, we had the introduction of the exciting A4000 and the AGA
graphics chips. This year, after reporting losses, Commodore introduced
the Amiga CD32; possibly less exciting in the minds of Amiga users, since
it's not a "power system".  But after seeing it and the enormous potential
it holds, I can't help but wonder if this is the key to regenerating a
beleaguered Commodore--if Commodore pumps CD32 for all it's worth.

On the third party front, new products were everywhere.  Graphics boards
were well represented with companies like Digital Micronics,
MacroSystemUS, Expert Services, GVP, and Centaur Development showing the
latest and greatest graphics add ons.  Despite Commodore's lack of an RTG
standard, third party companies have forged ahead with varying solutions
to get Amiga software to work on their boards.

Soft-Logik touted the advantages of PageSetter 3 over XPress 3.2 and
PageMaker 5.0, claiming that ProPage 4.1 wasn't even in the running.
Version 2.0 of TypeSmith was also announced.  GVP promoted its second
generation A1200 accelerator, a new graphics board, and its image
processing software ImageFX.  Scala MM300 has a host of new features to
enhance multimedia presentations (and it was great to see Scala actually
being used during the Commodore seminars (as it was last year)).  Centaur
Development showed an impressive demo tape accompanied by a techno
soundtrack for the new features of the upcoming OpalVision Video Modules.

KEYNOTE ADRESS/MPEG SEMINAR

A more somber mood was reflected in the Keynote Address.  Last year, we
got an exciting peek into the Amiga's future from Lew Eggebrecht--this
year, Jim Dionne began the Keynote Address, explaining what has happened
at Commodore in the last 12 months, what restructuring steps have been
taken, and what the product plans for the rest of 1993 are.

Dionne drew some laughs when he started out by misspeaking, saying
Commodore has had a rough past 12 years (instead of months).  The
increasingly competitive computer market has led to declining profit
margins.  80% of Commodore's sales are in Europe, where there's been an
"economic slowdown".  This, combined with a strong U.S. dollar, has pushed
Commodore's total sales figure down.  In addition, inventory write downs
have taken their toll.  On the bright side, Dionne said that Commodore has
taken its "bad medicine" and has a clean slate beginning its new fiscal
year.

The MPEG video cartridge add-on was big news.  Expected in November, this
add on will play back VideoCD disks with 74 minutes of video.  One of the
five CD32 units in the Commodore booth was equipped with a prototype, and
played music videos from a CD.  (The three videos were Bon Jovi's "Blaze
of Glory", Enya's "Caribbean Blue", and Seal's "Killer")

I was very surprised by the quality of the VideoCD.  Although the MPEG
compression routine discards information and plays back at a resolution of
352x240, the videos were easily as good or better than VHS tapes. The
VideoCDs don't have tracking problems, they don't wear out, and the audio
is as good as a regular CD.

The MPEG module does virtually all the work in playing the VideoCD disks.
All the 68EC020 must do is read data from the CD and send it to the audio
and video chips on the MPEG cartridge.  This takes up about 30% of the
processor's time, leaving a lot of potential.  The AGA chips are not used
to generate the video, the cartridge takes care of this.  However, AGA
graphics can be genlocked over the MPEG video.  This was used to a limited
extent by the current prototype player software, which used Amiga graphics
to display the song title, artist, time remaining and time played.
Needless to say, there is quite a bit of potential that can be put to use.

The prototype software itself has some glitches, which is to be expected.
There were apparently a few video glitches which I didn't notice, but were
explained as problems with the driver software. Also, the prototype player
only plays the videos, and does not yet allow for fast forward/rewind,
pausing, etc.  The interface is modeled after the CDTV's for playing
regular CD's, but that is likely to change and become more textual in
nature.  This is because the VideoCD can store the artist and titles, and
it may be better to display these than simply allowing the user to pick a
track number. The controller does have all the audio/VideoCD controls
labeled on it, so you don't have to have your TV/monitor on to control it,
although the CD32 itself has no LEDs or other indicators like a regular CD
player.

In both the Keynote Address and the MPEG seminar, it was indicated that
Commodore intends to be competitive in price with other CD platforms (3DO
and CD-I) for the VideoCD add on.  Although a firm price was not given, it
is expected to be $250 or less.  Commodore should have an advantage over
CD-I and 3DO for the VideoCD attachment, in that the Amiga graphics
systems is genlock ready.

It was stressed that the VideoCD format (which is about 3 months old) is
an industry standard, and many big name companies (Sony, Paramount, Warner
Bros., etc.) are interested in providing VideoCD disks.  The fact that
other companies besides Commodore will have VideoCD players strengthens
the potential of it becoming widespread. Commodore will have to
differentiate CD32 from the others to show the advantages of CD32.

The expansion bus (which the MPEG cartridge plugs into) provides full
processor, video, and audio connections.  CPU accelerators are possible
using this bus.

PRODUCT REPORTS

Jim Drew talked up the advantages of an Amiga with Emplant over the
Macintosh--in effect a better Macintosh than Macintosh to borrow a phrase
from IBM.  (All the while, I was cringing as he flexed an Emplant board
back and forth, expecting it to snap any minute.) Emplant now supports the
use of the Retina graphics board, allowing a 24 bit Macintosh display on
the Amiga.  Support for other video boards is currently in progress.  The
A3000 will run twice as fast as a Macintosh IIx.  Drew indicated that for
IBM compatible emulation, Intel 80x86 binaries will actually be translated
into 680x0 code, explaining how Emplant will deliver promised 386/486
emulation without the addition of a processor to the Emplant board.

SunRize industries demonstrated their Studio 16 hardware/software
combination.  Although there were a few minor technical glitches the
software is quite impressive in its ease of use.  Samples can be arranged
at will along 8 tracks and play in 16-bit CD quality.  They can be grouped
together if you need to keep them together (for instance, two samples each
going to separate left and right channels).  Volume adjustment, fade in
and fade out are all point and click operations.  They also showed how
incoming SMPTE time-code can be used to trigger the playing of samples.  A
movie trailer ("Expert Weapon") that was actually done with Studio 16 was
shown, with the video supplying the SMPTE time-code and the Studio 16
providing the audio in sync with the video.

The Picasso II graphics board is boasting the first true retargetable
graphics emulator for the Amiga.  Basically it allows any application that
uses the ASL screen mode requester to select a Picasso screen mode.  The
system does not use chip RAM; the currently displayed screen is kept in
the boards memory, and other screens can be stored in fast RAM. When a new
screen is switched to the front, it is quickly copied out of fast RAM into
the Picasso II's memory.  Picasso II supports the following resolutions:

  640 x  480, 2-256 colors
  800 x  600, 2-256 colors
 1024 x  768, 2-256 colors
 1120 x  832, 2-256 colors
 1152 x  900, 2-256 colors
 1280 x 1024, 2-256 colors

In addition, 24 bit graphics are supported in 640 x 480 and 800 x 600
resolutions, and a 64K colors in resolutions 1024 x 768 and above. The
Picasso II comes in both 1Mb and 2Mb versions, the 2Mb version being
necessary for the highest resolutions.

A different approach has been taken by GVP for its EGS-28/24 Spectrum.
The Spectrum is capable of using the Enhanced Graphics System device
library, which means that software has to be rewritten for it.  On the
plus side, software rewritten to the EGS library will work on any EGS
compatible board, and the function calls for the EGS library are as close
as possible to the Amiga's own graphics calls, which make porting
relatively simple.  The Spectrum also supports multiple boards and
monitors on the same computer, which can be very useful when you need to
see several things at once.  The Spectrum can also pass through the
Amiga's own display, which means you don't need a separate monitor for
both displays.

The Spectrum comes with 2Mb of display memory.  It uses a Cirrus Logic
video controller/processor which has a blitter.  A Workbench driver allows
non-EGS software that runs on the Workbench screen to be displayed by the
Spectrum.  The board will autosense whether it is in a Zorro II or Zorro
III machine, and has a "Zorro II force" option for Amigas that have
problems with 32-bit DMA on the Zorro III bus. In a Zorro II machine the
bus bandwidth is 3.5Mb/sec; in a Zorro III machine the bandwidth is
12Mb/sec.  The native EGS software list was quite short: EGS-Paint,
Rainbow Painter, an MPEG player still in development, and a Connect Four
game.

Like the Picasso II, the Spectrum supports 24 bit graphics in resolutions
up to 800 x 600, and 8 bit graphics up to 1280 x 1024. The Spectrum can go
up to 1600 x 1280 with 4 bits (16 colors).

One pleasant surprise was the Primera color printer from Fargo
Electronics.  What's most surprising is that they have been focusing on
the IBM PC compatible and Macintosh markets, and have recently added Amiga
support--to the point of writing their own Amiga printer driver, bundling
it with the printer, and offering it free (presumably for users who may
have already have access to a Primera, and would like to use the Amiga
with it).  They are so new to the Amiga market that the sample printouts
were done on Windows and Macintosh computers, although they did have an
Amiga running AdPro to demonstrate the printer.

The printer itself uses wax thermal transfer technology, and outputs at a
resolution of 203x203 dots per inch.  The price is $995 (the show special
price was about $750) and an optional $250 dye sublimation kit allows the
printer to produce exceptional graphics that knocked many people's socks
off.  If I looked very closely, I could see a few jagged edges, betraying
the printers 203 dpi resolution, but this is about the closest you can get
to near photographic quality at this price.

To achieve the low price point, some things have been sacrificed. The
Primera is a "dumb printer"; without an internal processor, only 32Kb of
RAM, and one internal font.  The printer is also slower than more
expensive color thermal printers, printing one page in two and a half
minutes.  The 203 dpi resolution also helped to cut costs; a 300 dpi
printer would have cost $200 to $300 more.

The Primera is especially targeted at presentation graphics because it is
more economical than ink jet printers when there is a high percentage of
coverage.  Amiga owners who need to produce output where most of the page
is covered should take a serious look at the Primera.

GVP introduced the second generation of their 1200 accelerator, the Turbo+
Performance Series II.  It features a full 68030 at 50Mhz, instead of the
40Mhz 68EC030 on the A1230 Tubro+.  A 68882 math coprocessor running at
50Mhz is optional.  A battery backed up clock, an option connector, and
two SIMM sockets round out the feature list. The SIMM sockets can accept
1Mb, 4Mb or 16Mb SIMMs.  The first product for the option connector is the
A1291 SCSI module.

Axiom's WaveMaker allows the automated creation of flying 3D logos with
Lightwave.  This may be a very specialized application, but the ease with
which you can set up an animation to be rendered is incredible.  It almost
as simple as selecting the logo you want to fly onto the screen (and how
you want it fly on and off) and what "elements" you want in the
background.  The "elements" consist of streaks, stars, etc. that you may
not notice when they are there, but do notice when they are missing.  The
logo can be centered on the screen, no matter what its final orientation
is.

Wavemaker can also be used to set up several animations for Lightwave to
render all in a row for unattended rendering.  Although the beta version
demonstrated at the seminar was incomplete, this looks to be very popular
among anyone who needs to do impressive flying logos quickly.

For those who need peer-to-peer networking, Interworks ENLAN-DFS may fit
the bill.  It works over Ethernet and allows volumes, files, and printers
on other workstations to act as local devices.  Password protection on
public resources, read only access, usernames and passwords provides
levels of security for data on the network. ENLAN-DFS supports ASDG Lan
ROVER, Commodore 2065, Ameristar, and Hydra interfaces for the 2000, 3000,
and 4000, and Interworks new PCMCIA Ethernet card.

The I-Card is Interwork's new PCMCIA Ethernet interface for the A1200 and
A600.  It is compatible with Commodore's SANA-II standard, and has 10BaseT
and 10Base2 connectors.  At $299 for the I-Card, and $349 for a 5-node
license of ENLAN-DFS, this may not be solution for the casual home user
who needs to hook up two machines. In a situation where there are several
Amigas of mixed types and peripherals need to be shared among them,
ENLAN-DFS is worth looking into.

Lightwave users might also want to take a look at Interworks Toaster-Net
software, which provides the capabilities of setting up a render-farm.
Its features include the ability to render a sequence of Lightwave
scenes, render selective frames, delegate rendering across the network,
automate moving complete scenes between systems, and monitor the status of
the render-farm.  Toaster-Net requires Toaster 3.0 software, and
Interworks recommends using ENLAN-DFS with it to take full advantage of
its capabilities.  Toaster-Net is also priced at $349 per 5-nodes.

                The World of Commodore-Amiga '93 - Take 3
                              by @{" Eric Penn " link eric }

Anyone who has ever taken a transistor radio onto an airplane knows that
you can really get a "feel" for a region simply by listening to the radio
stations in that area.  Likewise, during a 7 hour drive halfway across a
state, one can get feel for the prevelant attitudes there.  And having
just made the same trip exactly a year previous, the differences are
amazingly obvious, and the similarities shocking.

This year's west-coast WoCA show did not feature the standard-dissolving,
mind-blowing transformation of the "old" ECS Amiga into the amazing new
AGA Amiga.  Instead, the initial US introduction of the Amiga CD^32
appears to be a true phoenix, about to rise from the ashes of what was
once Commodore US.

Technically this machine is the most advanced Amiga ever.  What it lacks
in sheer processor speed, it makes up for in snazzy engineering.  The
newest addition to the Amiga "family" of custom chips, Akiko, coupled with
the AGA enhancements made last year, is sure to breathe new life into the
Amiga. Even the most adamant anti-Amiga developer will no longer have any
valid excuses to not convert the best selling games to this new machine.

Did I say "games"?  Yes, I did.  While the Amiga CD^32 is in fact a real
Amiga computer, capable of any task that any other Amiga can handle and
more, it will be marketed as a "game machine" along side the Sega Genesis
and the Nintendo SNES boxes.  And along side them, it should sell.

Wait a minute.  That word... "marketed".  For years Commodore has been
almost vehement in its ANTI-marketing stance, it has almost seemed as if
they were trying to not sell machines.  Well, brace yourself.  Things have
really changed.  In his keynote speech, Jim Dionne, President of
Commodore's U.S. Operations, acknowledged the companies poor performance
over the last year. Despite the depressing subject, Mr. Dionne presented
the image of a company that is willing to change with the times, adapt to
the current market, and ready to take the initiative needed to regain
market share.  In an unplanned slip of the tongue during his opening
remarks he said "We have had a very tough twelve years... er... months."
The crowd responded with a chuckle, which set the stage for the
encouraging news he presented. Commodore -is- in the process of
rebuilding.  Regardless of what some doomsayers may lead you to believe,
Commodore US has a very good idea of where they are, and where they are
going.  And from the looks of things, they even know how to get there.

On the subject of advertising, one of the demonstrations running on the
CD^32 machines on the floor would make an incredible 15-second television
advertisement.  The screen fades in from black to a typical Sega-esque
game. A tiny player sprite runs from screen right to screen left, being
pursued by a much larger dinosaur sprite.  A male voiceover says, "Is this
your idea of playing games?"  The dinosaur sprite reaches mid- screen.  It
pauses.  The voiceover asks, "Or is THIS!?" as the dinosaur sprite doubles
in size, morphing into a 256-color, texture mapped, photo-realistic,
anamatronic beast.  It turns its head to look out the screen at the
viewer, opens its many toothed maw and ROARS!  Fade to black.  A shiver
of excitement ran down my spine as I imagined the closing voiceover, "The
new Amiga CD^32, the world's first 32-bit game machine.  Coming soon to a
store near you."  None of the Commodore employees would comment on this
supposition.

However, one of the staff on hand did describe the -actual- television
commercial which is currently in production and will be running very soon
in Europe.  What his description was lacking in detail, it more than made
up for in content.  The scene is a dank dungeon.  Two scientific looking
individuals clad in white lab coats hover over a CD^32.  One asks,
"32-bit, you say?"  The other replies, "Yes, but don't touch it!  It's
part of an experiment!"  He then opens a very LARGE door and in walks a 12
foot tall robot: THE ULTIMATE GAME PLAYER.  The robot picks up the
controller and begins to play.  Several one-second shots of a variety of
games will then be shown, followed by the robot exploding in a shower of
sparks!  The two scientists look at each other and proclaims the
superiority of the CD^32 by virtue of its 32-bit design.

If the show had included nothing else besides the Commodore keynote
speeches and the five CD^32 machines displayed on the show floor, it would
have been worth attending.  Instead, a bevy of 24-bit display cards
peppered the show floor.  Last year's WoCA show focused on Video
Production and morphing software, this year was the year of the 24-bit
display card. Firecracker, OpalVision, Picasso II, Piccolo, EGS-28/24
Spectrum, Retina, Video Toaster; old, and new, there has never before been
such an array of display options available to the Amiga user.

Utilities Unlimited was running the amazing Emplant on three different
Amiga models, along side a real Macintosh II.  Several show-goers
approached with "real" Macintosh disks to try out on Emplant.  Nearly all
worked fine, without even so much as a burp from Emplant.  The solitary
exception was a disk which upon insertion into the Macintosh was
discovered to be badly damaged, and barely usable even on its native
platform.  Emulation does have its limits and apparently this test had
exceeded them.  Overall, not bad performance from a product which was
publicly discounted in many forums at its inception.  Jim Drew, president
and founder of Utilities Unlimited, mentioned that he should have the IBM
'386/'486 emulation module ready for release soon.  This is a product to
watch!

And on the other side of the show floor, two young programmers from
Richmond, VA set up shop.  The product they were hawking was a tiny
matchbox-sized box that plugs into the serial port of any Amiga and allows
it to run NewTek's LightWave 3-D modeling software, without a Video
Toaster!  Anyone who has ever wanted the ease of use and speed of
LightWave 3-D renderings, now can have it.  In the booth, an A1200 running
LightWave 3-D version 3.0 (obviously not equipped with a Video Toaster,
which requires a video slot) pumped out a rendering of a Jolt Cola can on
request.  How long will this product last?  Only time will tell.
LightWave 3-D is not included in the package (although LightWave 3-D
version 3.0 "upgrades" are available from many mail-order vendors for
about $699), so it may be difficult for NewTek to contest the legality of
the product.  Even for a user who is not "into" video production, this is
an exciting product.

A year later, and while some things are very different, some things are
very much the same.  Commodore management seems to finally found the
direction they want to move in, and have made the adjustments needed to
accomplish those goals.  Third parties continue to crank out amazing
products, and the Amiga line continues to expand at a furious and
exhilarating pace.  I can hardly wait for next year's show!

                           The Eggebrecht Tapes

@{" Lew Eggebrecht " system "$viewer lew"} - formerly of IBM, currently Vice-President of Engineering
for Commodore Business Machines - always gives a good speech.  He has a
firm grasp on the "lore" of the Amiga, and definite ideas about its
future.  And he's a man who makes things happen.  Within the space of a
year, he oversaw the release of the Amiga 4000, 1200, CD32, and shortly
the 4000T.  And when he speaks, everyone listens.  Lew delivers his
remarks with a candor uncharacteristic of most industry representatives.

However, most Amigans never get a chance to hear him speak, and read only
bits and pieces of what he's said.  Because of that, ViewPort is proud to
present most of Lew's remarks from the 1993 World of Commodore-Amiga show
in Pasadena.  The text was transcribed from a tape recording of the
keynote speech, and has been lightly edited for readability.

"The Amiga CD32 is a project that was started shortly after we actually
started the 1200, even though it actually came out after the 1200 and
after the 4000. This was an interesting project from the standpoint that
it's probably the first time that we went to the developers and end users
and we really tried to find out what they wanted with respect to
development environment and respect to the product specifications.  And
this is unique in the fact that we ... actually talked to a number of
major game developers, and they actually assisted us in developing the
specifications of this product.

It's not just engineering standing back in a corner and doing whatever
they want.  We actually listened to the developers, and quite frankly, we
got all kinds of input and it really helped us a lot in the definition of
the product.

It is, we believe, the world's first 32-bit game console. Although it's
much more than a game console, as you will discover, we are primarily
focusing on the game environment.

We like to think of it as a follow-on to the CDTV.  In fact, it plays many
of the CDTV titles.  We learned a lot from CDTV, both from a technology
standpoint and from a marketing standpoint.

We learned that the price point of CDTV was much too high for consumer
environments, we learned that we needed more performance, and we learned
that people really wanted entertainment on these kinds of products.
Education type titles, reference material titles - they're all really
nice, but people really like to play games.  And so we first decided that
this was our major target in this product, to understand how we could play
exceptional games, and "oh, by the way, it still is an interactive
multimedia platform, and it plays most of the old CDTV titles and a lot of
new titles.

We were in a position, now that we had proven the viability of the AGA
chipset in the 1200 and the 4000, we began to understand that this
technology had to go into a CDTV-like product.  And so the AGA chipset was
proven functional and very very cost-effective and high performance, and
it was our natural choice for this kind of product.

So the same capabilities that you find in our 4000s and our 1200s, with
respect to video capabilities, exist fully in the CD games system.

We chose to upgrade the processor to the same processor that's used in the
1200, using the 68000 EC020 running at 14 MHz.  This gives us
approximately a 4 MIP capability in the machine, several times the
performance of the old machine, and some of our competitors, which are
still 68000-based - again, several times the performance.

One of the major concerns was how much memory should be in a games system.
Obviously, all the software people said "8 megabytes is just fine, it will
be easy to write code for."  And then we told them the price, and they
said "Maybe not!"  So we did - and this was a major point of discussion;
there are significant costs associated with the memory, and it ends up
representing a very significant percentage of the cost of the system, so
there are a lot of hard decisions - we chose the 2 megabyte model, because
it was compatible with the 1200, and we knew that we could do good games
in that model.


There is 1 megabyte of ROM in the system.  This contains AmigaDOS, it
contains an enhanced version of AmigaDOS - by the way, this enhanced
version will also shortly be available on the other products.  Obviously,
we needed to add the CD file system support, we made a number of
enhancements to support the game controller, and we added a number of
other features that allowed the operating system to be controlled, and
actually even shut down in some cases in a graceful manner, allowing the
developer to have full access to the bandwidth of the system.  This is a
little different approach than some of our competitors have taken, and we
believe we have the best of both worlds, we have a full-blown AmigaDOS
operating system in the game machine, and yet we allow the developer to
control what features and how he uses that operating system.

We also have 1 Kbyte of non-volatile memory that allows high scores - as a
matter of fact, you can see a little demo of how that works if you go down
to the floor.  We also designed our own custom CD-ROM drive.  One of the
key things that allows us to achieve the price point of $399, it is very
very cost effective CD-ROM drive technology.

We learned a lot from the activity that we had with the CDTV, and our
experience there, and as a result, combining a Sony mechanism with our own
custom design and our own microcode, we achieved an outstanding
performance at extremely low cost.  The drive does support a 2x speed
mode, and also supports multisession capability.  This allows us to
eventually support, for example, Kodak PhotoCD, which requires
multisession capability.

The system supports the standard Amiga audio, 4-voice stereo capability.
It also naturally supports the CD 16-bit capability.  So audio can be
selected either as generated from Amiga or directly from the CD drive.

Of course, we support a stereo line out capability - there's a connector
at the back.  We have a headset port, which also has a volume control,
although the headset itself is not shipped with the machine; any standard
unit that you purchase - at Radio Shack, for example - will operate.

From a video standpoint, we support, from an output capability, RF output
- with an RF modulator built in to the unit; there's no external device
required. That comes standard with the unit.  We support the composite
video output, and we also support an S-video output for the new TVs.  If
you've ever tried the S-Video port, it makes a very significant
improvement in the video quality, allowing the full video capability of
the machine to be demonstrated.

And of course, it has the capabilities of the AGA chipset - 256 colors out
of a palette of 16 million, or - using the HAME (HAM8) mode - in excess of
256 thousand colors simultaneously on a screen.  On a TV resolution
screen, this means that every pixel on the screen can have a different
color, so you have essentially a true-color capability in the system.

We have 2 game controller ports built in.  These game controller ports are
100% compatible with the existing controller ports on the Amiga. They have
been enhanced to extend and support the joypad capability, with the
11-button controller that we support.  One controller is shipped with the
unit and a second can be purchased separately.  In addition, you can
attach the mouse or any other device - joystick - that would normally
operate on the Amiga, that is also electrically compatible, and if the
software supports it, it will operate.  We have attempted to put software
into the system that will accept these other devices, and figure out what
they are, and then try to emulate the joypad capabilities.

We have an auxiliary port on the system.  This auxiliary port is
essentially the Amiga keyboard interface, and as such, the Amiga keyboard
can attach to it.  Our intention with this port was to support other
features, other than keyboards, although keyboards obviously will work.
For example, our intent is that virtual reality-type peripherals can
utilize this port to gain access to the system.  Headsets, handsets, that
type of thing - through this serial port, we have more than enough
performance to control and to operate those types of peripherals.

In addition, the Amiga serial port is also available in this same
connector.  Further, we positioned this connector in a position on the
machine that allows us to add an IR (Infrared) module interface at that
port, if one wished. Most of the game developers which this system was
primarily targeted to don't like to deal with IR because of the
difficulties associated with software, but the machine is capable of being
upgraded to support an IR interface.

Expansion bus - As Jim pointed out, our intention is not to make this a
dead-end machine.  And this is the most important feature, I think, of the
Amiga CD.  It is capable of supporting expansion through the full
availability of approximately a 180-pin connector at the back of the
machine.  The machine also accepts one board inside the unit, therefore
one feature can go inside.  And the architecture is designed such that you
can also extend beyond that single board to further support additional
boards and additional features in the system.

So we have available the full microprocessor bus, very similar to the
situation that we have in the 1200.  We have the full audio bus available
at that interface, and we also have the full video bus available.  A good
example of a peripheral that utilizes most of those capabilities is the
MPEG player that we have been demonstrating here, that supports the MPEG
technology with the compatibility with the new video CD standard which
allows linear play across multiple platforms.

Obviously, other peripherals can be attached to this, and we can make
available to developers information on how to attach peripherals and other
devices to this unit.  We've had a lot of interest in exploring new
opportunities with this device, or as Jim mentioned, it would make a very
interesting TV-top addition, where you could support either satellite or
cable interactivity, plus the ability to play games and play CDs, and
become the ... entertainment center of a home.

Obviously, as you can accelerate other systems, the CPU bus does support
the addition of accelerators.  For example, there's no reason that someone
couldn't design a 25 - 40 MHz 68040, and eventually perhaps, even a 68060,
to add performance to the system.  From the standpoint of being a game
machine, we also want to point out again that it is really an interactive
multimedia player that also supports audio CDs with a graphical user
interface.  Also, it is designed so that the controller - you don't have
to have the TV.  The legends on how to control it as an audio device are
right on the controller board.  So the TV can be off; you don't need the
graphical user interface.  It will play standard audio CDs; it also plays
CD+G; it also supports the Karaoke or Video CD standard - obviously with
the MPEG player module.

It supports a large portion of the CDTV titles. We did an extensive amount
of work to test for compatibility; there are a large number of titles that
are compatible. The major area of difference is the controller area,
versus the CDTV-type controller.  But we went to great effort to take the
top 30 CDTV titles and ensure that they run on the system.  And of course,
we will play all of the new titles that are specifically designed for the
CD32, this meaning, obviously, all the new game software that is under
development.

One of the most important reasons we've been able to garner such
significant software support is the fact that this platform has a very
mature development environment; all of the tools that are available for
the Amiga are available and will operate as a developing environment for
the Amiga CD32.

We have been able to obtain overwhelming developer support in the game
areas.  Initially, we worked very carefully with a small group of
developers, to help us in the definition of the system, and we did
initially limit the number of developers to the set that we could actually
support, and that was very very important to us.  Now, we're in the
position that we can support developers and have a development environment
available, and we're encouraging additional developers.  At this point, we
have in excess of 35 developers that are licensees and are actually
producing titles.  These people didn't sign up just to say they signed up;
they're actually producing titles.  and that's why we're very careful
about the people we've selected; they had to actually produce titles.

We will have over 50 titles by Christmas.  We expect now somewhere around
75 actual titles available.  The software - initially a lot of it is
software that is ported from other Amiga applications.  There are a number
of brand-new applications that are coming out.  Some of them you can see.
For example, Jurassic Park is one of the new applications.   It takes
about 18 months to do a true title, so the really great stuff is a few
months away.  But still, we find that these titles are excellent, and
compared to other competitor's titles, on this platform are outstanding.

Low cost software.  One of the big, major reasons that we've had great
developer support is the fact that the CD technology in itself has a media
that's extremely low cost.  Developers that have been working on these
cartridge type applications, obviously they have to pay a license fee,
they have to pay for the cartridge - as a matter of fact, they actually
have to pay for them in advance - and they have to wait 6 to 8 weeks
before they actually get their product, so inventory management is very
very difficult to do.

Cartridges typically cost somewhere in the order of 10 to 20 dollars,
depending on the amount of ROM involved in it.  In our case, we can have
cost of goods that's less than a dollar.  In the case of cartridges, they
have to be manufactured either by the licenser or by a designated
supplier.  In our case, in our license, you can have them manufactured
anywhere you want.  And the license fee that we charge is $3.00 a disk.
But we only charge it on product that's actually sold. In the case of
cartridges, if you pay the license fee, build 10,000 of them and sell
2,000, you still have to pay for the product.  So it's a much more
flexible environment.  This is what we believe will actively drive the CD
market.  We, for example, are now able to see pricing of CD applications
on this platform that are 50 - 75% less than prices on other platforms. We
think that this is very key to both driving developers, and, of course, a
major benefit to the customers.

I'd like now to spend some time with the other activities that we've had
going on, that we have in other meetings told you about.  Obviously, we
have next-generation capabilities that we're working on, and many of you
have heard of the capabilities of our new triple-A chipset, which when you
compare it to the AGA, we're talking about performance of 10 to 20 times
the capability.

This chipset has actually had a very dramatic in the last week or so; we
actually have running silicon!  I'm pleased to report that we have a lot
of bugs, but we were recently able to bring up software and were able to
show 24-bit true color images, and were able to blit them around the
screen."


That concluded my tape's capacity to absorb Lew's remarks.  However,
thanks to a working pen, I was able to capture these other tidbits:

 - The AAA chipset (4 chips in all) needs a second pass, but Lew expects
fully functional prototypes by next year, and expects AAA to be in
products by mid-year.

 - The A4000T, the tower version of the A4000, is done and was being shown
on the main floor.  Delivery of this product is now in the hands of
Shipping and marketing.

 - Commodore is restarting the manufacture of the A4091 SCSI-II adaptor,
and expects to have the product available in 6 to 8 weeks.

 - The DSP (Digital Signal Processor) project has been suspended.  The
first-pass hardware had been completed, and it was ready to go to gate
array.  Commodore is willing to license this technology to a third party
for free.  (Later, Lew indicated that he'd like to re-start the DSP
project after the first of the year.)  Other products available for
3rd-party license include the AGA Scan Converter (which de-interlaces the
remaining interlaced modes of AGA), the networking software, multiport
serial board, and the Ethernet adaptor.

 - The CD peripheral for the A1200 and A4000 is actively being developed.
 The prototype has been tooled, and Commodore hopes to ship it by the end
of the year.

 - RTG (ReTargetable Graphics) development has been slowed down, but
Commodore expects to complete it and ship it with the AAA chipset.

 - AmigaDOS 3.1, with improved graphics routines and support for the
CD-ROM player, was completed shortly before the show and should be
shipping soon.

 - The A1200 will be equipped with a high density floppy drive.

 - Commodore has no plans for a laptop, but is willing to support a
3rd-party effort, provided they don't create a "deviant" version of the
operating system.

And all too soon, it was over.  Although there were more questions, there
was no more time.  But the "Amiga Rabble" who attended, perhaps fearing
the worst, went away happy.

                        Brilliance - The New King
                            by @{" Sylvia Lutnes " link syl }

Amiga painting is fun again. Spontaneity has returned and we are again
able to be creative instead of drumming our fingers between operations.
Our masterpieces and animations are safe from our own wild experiments
through multiple level UNDO and REDO. We are free to play and explore and
we again have the luxury of making mistakes and learning from
them...serendipity and good software can bring amazing results.

They're Here

The long-awaited Brilliance from Digital Creations for all Amigas has
arrived, rather, they have arrived. Brilliance is actually two programs:
Brilliance itself is register-based for color-spaces from 2 to 256, and
TrueBrilliance is for HAM6, HAM8, 15 and 24-bit painting and animation.
The two programs sport identical interfaces and (except for a couple of
items) the same feature set. And Brilliance is fast...even considering the
speed limitations of AGA HAM8. If you've ever waited for a full screen
gradient fill in DPaint 4, you'll appreciate the difference. Though some
operations are not instantaneous they do not generate a trip to the
refrigerator either.

Interface

Unlike other types of software, painting often involves changing many
parameters between operations. With Brilliance you can access the controls
for drawmode, transparency, and range at the same time without hunting
down items from pull-down menus. Brilliance uses slide-up @{" panels " system "$viewer brill.panls"} and opens
with its main panel of tools and functions. Clicking on a tool with the
LMB activates it, clicking with RMB adds another panel with controls for
further defining the tool. Click on the Pentip tool with the RMB, for
example, and it adds a panel from which you can select and size your
pentip.

You can have various combinations of panels open simultaneously and set up
hotkeys to access particular sets from the keypad. (Keypad hotkeys are not
available on the A600.) Preconfigured panel-sets are already mapped to the
keypad and I've so far had no reason to change them. The visible panels
can all be toggled at once with the F10 key, MMB, or spacebar...or the
extra panels can be collapsed under the main panel by clicking on the
'squash' button. To close individual panels, click with the LMB on the
left side. The 'user-feedback' area on the main panel shows you at all
times what you are doing...what tool is under the cursor, what draw mode
is current and what frame of an animation you're on. It takes a little
time to get used to this method if you've only used pull-down menus, and
it will take time to learn what exactly is available where, but it is
definitely worth the effort. Once learned, there's no way I'd go back to
pull-down menus for a painting program.

Buffers

The Buffer tool from the main panel is your link between Brilliance and
the outside world. Here you create and select buffers (as many as memory
permits). Each can contain either an image or an animation and can have
its own palette. As far as I can tell, each buffer must have the same size
and resolution though you can change screen mode at any time. You also
save and load pictures from here as well as set preferences (which
includes adjusting the size of your UNDO buffer), print, and quit. The
clipboard is supported and you can load and work with bitmaps larger than
your screen and chip memory. Brushes, Stencils, Animbrushes, and Palettes
are all saved and loaded from their own respective panels.

Tools

Brilliance has much the same tool-set as DPaint and uses the same keyboard
shortcuts: 'm' for magnify, 'j' for spare screen, 'alt' for anim painting,
etc. Many of the tools, however, have been greatly enhanced or work
slightly differently. You now have a filled straight-line and filled-curve
tool besides the filled freehand tool. The airbrush tool has a brush mode
that allows you to splatter paint thru a brush mask. When cutting a brush
you can lasso the area you wish to snip by drawing around it which makes
cutting those odd shaped brushes a snap. For the operations that are
similar to DPaint, you usually have to go about it a different way which
will be confusing at first. A few operations are slightly slower (a
perspective fill from a brush, for example, is slower even with
anti-aliasing off) though most are noticeably faster.

Draw Modes

Besides the normal stable of drawing modes, Brilliance adds tint,
colorize, darken, lighten, stencil (for painting an area of protection),
range (for cycling the paint under the pen), random cycle (for airbrush),
two dithers, and more.

Palette

The palette is always visible on the main panel. It shows up to 64 colors
and a simple click on the arrow beside it will expand it to show the
entire spectrum. And the colors are visible...they're not fuzzed out by
ham mode since Brilliance uses copper magic to display them. The palette
panel and functions are explained very well in the manual.

Gradients

You can define up to 8 ranges that can have up to 128 color tabs each.
Add, subtract, and move color tabs with simple mouse clicks. Methods of
using ranges are found in the Draw Modes panel and must be selected in
order to use your gradients for fills, lines, and splatters. If your color
space is large enough, Brilliance will spread colors between tabs to give
you a smoother gradient. You can select how many steps you want
interpolated. You can also stack markers with two colors to give an abrupt
transition at that spot. Of course, dither level, clear, cycle and
reversing the tabs are supported. (Cycle not available in TrueBrilliance.)

Stencil

Very robust. You can even do stencil masks for all frames of an animation.
You can lasso an area containing the colors you want or pick them from the
screen with an eye-dropper. And using stencil from the Draw Modes panel
allows you to paint any area on the screen to protect it. In
TrueBrilliance the selection is a bit more complex allowing you to define
a variance range for colors to include.

Transparency

My favorite function. A simple slider belies the magic of using
transparency with, for example, gradient fills. The larger your
color-space, the more subtle the effect.

Text

Text handling makes use of scalable Compugraphic fonts so you can select
any size you wish. This works for bitmap fonts also, but scaling them is
not recommended. You cannot write text directly on the screen, however.
You must type your text string in the Font requester. This is brought to
your main screen as a brush which you stamp in place.

Anti-Aliasing

The 4 levels of anti-aliasing are quite fast for most operations and
incorporate smoothing which you need an extra step for in DPaint. I did
have some confusion with anti-aliasing, however. Though it works with
perspective fill (filling a shape with a brush) I couldn't make it work on
a stretch, pattern or shape fill using the same brush.

Mirror

Symmetry in DPaint translates loosely to Mirror in Brilliance. The manual
seems to have been written before this tool was finished. I don't
understand how to adjust it, though I can change its behavior, and it
doesn't seem to support multiple points beyond doubling x and y.

Brushes and AnimBrushes

There are 8 wells to store brushes and animbrushes for easy retrieval. All
the functions you're used to having with brushes are included...and some
are easier and more intuitive. For cutting animbrushes you have the choice
of putting actual screen coordinates into a requester in case you can't
visualize how far the brush roams during the anim. You can also set the
number of frames to cut and whether to cut backwards or forwards. One
biggie is being able to change the frame number of the current animbrush.
Many times in DPaint I've clicked with an animbrush and had to undo and
then found my frame count was off. You can also animpaint over a different
number of frames than you have in the animbrush. You can animpaint
backwards! or ping-pong and you can 'pause' your animbrush frame so that
you can paint with it like a regular brush. You can morph between your
current brush and any (regular) brush in a well.

Animations and Tweening

Every function in DPaint's Move requester is available...and then some.
You can use Adjust from the Tween Panel to visually stamp your beginning
and ending positions, and use the mouse to set rotation, and perspective.
Ease controls allow more flexibility with XOver determining the frame
where ease-in changes to ease-out. And opacity is handled like the
coordinates---you can have fade adhere to acceleration and deceleration
parameters. You can even get yourself fading trails.

Wishes and Things

You can bring pictures and brushes from Brilliance into TrueBrilliance,
but there are no conversion routines built into Brilliance to go the other
way. Motion paths have been hinted at...hope that's true. And I would like
to see ARexx support for making anim frames. I can see the type of
abstract animations that make great transitions in Scala being easily
automated thru Arexx. On my wishlist also is adding a DITTO that heeds
changes to parameters on Redo and I would like Brilliance to honor
transparency when merging from the spare screen.

And MORE tutorials. Heh. Well, maybe that's what Viewport is for. As good
as the manual is, I would have liked tutorials that covered every function
and operation.

Be aware that 256 color pics saved from Brilliance tend to crash from
DOpus...I think this is a DOpus problem since DOpus has nose-dived on 256
color pics from some other programs as well. Also Brilliance is the only
program I've found that doesn't let WindX activate another screen when I
use L-Amiga-M to switch.

As for bugs, except for the anti-aliasing problem above, I haven't really
found any. Rather amazing for a first release.

Requirements, Manual, Installation

Brilliance will run with any Amiga under 1.3 or higher. It requires a
minimum of 2 megs but 4 megs is recommended. Installation is painless,
though it will add a program to your c: directory and add a line to your
startup. Digital has given us a truly professional manual which details
every button and operation and has explanations throughout. There's a
Quickstart section, tutorials, and a complete index. I just don't
understand why the cover is not in color.

The tutorials are fun to do. One of them is the best idea for a tutorial
I've yet run into. It's almost worth the price of the program just for the
fishtank and fish. This is a project that's fun to come back to again and
again.

Copy Protection

Please note that the copy protection is in the form of a joystick port
dongle. I was very annoyed when I opened the box and found that the dongle
does not even have a passthru. I was even more annoyed when I discovered
that Brilliance won't honor its own dongle when it is plugged into Scala's
(which HAS a passthru). In the meantime, I have placed my Scala dongle in
my mouse port and can run both programs with no problems. (Editor's Note:
This is the method recommended by Digital Creations.) Digital Creations is
considering a more reasonable solution but I fear it will still involve
hardware.

Conclusions

DPaint is a great program. Unfortunately it bogged down terribly under
both HAM and AGA. The time is right for us to have a successor and I feel
very strongly that Brilliance is more than worthy of succeeding DPaint.
Considering that this is just the first release of Brilliance and it
already surpasses our old standby in so many areas, can you imagine what
the future for Brilliance might hold.

This month I have decided to talk about scanning camera-ready artwork. By
definition, camera ready art is artwork that has been prepared via the
offset litho process and is devoid of any imperfections whatsoever. It is
the most desirable medium for logo reproduction. Camera-ready art is
always black and white or color separated black and white components of a
color logo. If you have a business and you advertise, make sure to always
request a camera-ready version of your company identity from the printer
and/or artist that you have contracted. This way if you own a scanner, you
will be able to use the artwork to produce your own business related
projects.

On choosing a scanner, I recommend a flatbed scanner. Hand held scanners,
which depend on the steadiness of your hand, yield unpredictable results.
Here at the station I use a Sharp JX100 and an Epson 600C for my freelance
business. The Art Department Professional drivers are used for both
scanners. In my opinion, the ADPro drivers are definitely superior to
others. They have the most versatile settings and produce the most
favorable results.  Now for some useful scanning tips:

1) Always scan artwork and photos at the highest dot per inch setting
possible with your memory configuration. This way, you always have a large
version to reduce to various smaller sizes. The other great advantage to
this method is sharpness. Using a large scan and reducing it produces a
high degree of anti-aliasing.

2) Always scan color in 24bit and black and white work in 8bit gray. This
allows you the option to do bitplane reductions to meet the needs of many
different projects. Save it as a master in which to make all your up and
coming versions.

3) Crop your work. Crop out all unnecessary items. Make your final scan
contain the closest image you desire to be a final product.

4) Scale the screen height of your scans 14%. The reason for this is
aspect ratio. Scanners scan in a square resolution. Two hundred dots per
inch means 200 x 200. Screen displays are in rectangular resolutions, such
as 640 x 400. Reducing the height 14% will correct the image aspect ratio
for rectangular screen resolutions. @{" Example #1 " system "$viewer example1"} shows a logo without height
reduction. Notice the obvious egg shape of the circular component of the
logo. @{" Example #2 " system "$viewer example2"} shows the logo after a 14% height reduction. Now the zero
looks round and circular instead of being stretched.

5) Make sure that you have obtained the rights to reproduce what you scan.
Trademarks and logos should never be used in a project without obtaining
consent.

Here are some addresses and phone numbers to obtain consent to reproduce
major league sports logos:

 National Football League Properties, Inc.   NBA Media Relations
 410 Park Avenue                             NYC, NY
 New York, New York 10022                    (212) 826-7000

 NHL Promotions                              Major League Baseball

 (416) 798-0809                              (212) 339-7800

If you have valid reasons and needs to reproduce sports logos (for
broadcast news or promotion) the above contacts should provide helpful.
Faxing them a request for a logo kit with your company letterhead usually
yields a very nice complete portfolio of all team logos in camera-ready
format. The above phone numbers are voice phone numbers.

Next month I will be covering 2d to 3d logo conversion. As always I can be
reached via GEnie mail for questions and suggestions. My mail address is
W.CAMAROTA. See you next month...Same Time, Same Channel.

                    Mand2000 - Fractals Rediscovered
                            by @{" Sylvia Lutnes " link syl }

                                  Socks

I had become rather blase about Mandelbrot pictures. After a while they
all looked like striped socks descending to a black hole. Then, without
fanfare or hype, along comes Mand2000 to steal my weekend, put a 'no
vacancy' sign on my hard drive, and etch swirling fantasies on my
sleepless eyeballs.

In the first few days I had the program, I saved out almost 8 megs worth
of pictures and not a sock in sight. I've seen things I've never seen
before and been deeper into the set than I would ever have had the
patience for. The palette mapping is superb and gives tremendous variety
since the same rendering mapped different ways is not immediately
recognizable as the same picture. You can get socks if you want...but
you'll probably leave them in the bureau.

Click-click

What you'll notice the most is the interaction. Click-click. You can move
thru the Mandelbrot space with mouse, keyboard, or joystick. Click-click
and zoom in. The screen will be quickly redrawn at the zoomed-to level.
Like draft mode in printing, it's fast, not yet 'pretty' but gives you an
idea of what's there...a preview mode. There is no need to wait so zoom in
some more, click-click. Anytime, anywhere. Want to move to the left? do
so. Mand2000 only redraws what is necessary. Click-click. Oops, went too
far. You can back up. Click-click. Stop, this is a @{" good spot. " system "$viewer Mand"}  Now watch as
the program increases the resolution outward from the center until your
picture is finished.

Do it Amiga Style

Because the program works asynchronously with itself, while you're waiting
for your finished masterpiece you can open another window, click-click to
a new destination and let her rip. Or choose to do the corresponding Julia
in yet another window. Adjust window size, maximum iterations,
color-mapping...and watch the changes in real-time. Open as many windows
as your memory allows..each with its own color-mapping, iterations and
cycle parameters. And there's an ARexx port for each one.

Mand2000 opens in any resolution your Amiga and monitor allows and it also
works happily on Workbench. (AGA machines can brot in 256 colors). You can
set the priority from the program and use shortcut keys for almost all
operations. The Help key and a Status window are available at all times.

Animation

Two types of animations are built in. Morph and Zoom. Zoom creates an
animation from the 'outside' to whatever brot your active window is at.
All you do is select the option from the menu and click on 'Make Movie'.
If you choose not to utilize its built in 'Tween' player mode, you can
select the number of frames, 'Make Movie', then you need to build the anim
file yourself from the completed frames. Morph lets you adjust the shape
of the daddy brot and then morphs between the daddy brot and its
distortion.

Speed

Mand2000 has been optimized for all processors. It will be at least as
fast as the fastest generators around on a 68000. On an 040 it flies.
Because it is so easy to go deep into the set, and because it can
calculate up to 15,000 iterations per pixel, you might want to reduce the
maximum number of iterations when you go too far. However, if you see too
much black in the picture, increase the iterations a bit. The program does
do a very good job of estimating the number of calculations needed at any
level.

No 24-bit, but images can be converted with AdPro, ImageFX, or Brilliance.
It has been reported that some dongles may interfere with zooming so if
there are problems, remove the offending dongle before running. I have
used Mand2000 with the dongles from both Scala and Brilliance without
trouble.

Requirements

Any Amiga running 2.0 or greater.

                            by @{" David J. R. Ward " link dward}

I was recently looking around for a replacement printer and it came as a
nice surprise to be offered the chance to compare a couple of machines.

Both are bubblejet and are positioned at the lower desktop price range.
The Canon BJ200 has a recommended price of £399, while the Fujitsu B100 is
offered at £349. Both prices exclude VAT. (Editor's Note: VAT is Value
Added Tax, not yet a problem in the U.S.)   Weighing in at six and a half
pounds each, these are no portables and the size and shape of the Canon
does not make for easy transport.

The Fujitsu is just over a foot wide and six inches deep. Its thickness is
also about six inches and this gives it a boxy appearance. In contrast,
the Canon is less deep but has greater height, the front curving up and
back for roughly seven inches. This gives it an avant-garde appearance.
More of a piece of sculpture than a printer. Fujitsu's box reminds me of
those containers you get on the back of lorries.

The B100 has two flaps that unfold to provide paper support and alignment,
one that covers the printhead carriage, another one underneath that
protects the dip switches, and a small one on top that hides a memory card
slot.

The BJ200 has a canyon to its rear into to which a stack of paper is
dropped. This is the auto-sheet feeder that allows you to get on with your
work, rather than have to stand-by with the next sheet. Unfortunately,
such a device is an optional extra on the Fujitsu.

Other such extras include printer emulation cards for Epson and IBM
compatibility, font cards, and expansion memory. The B100 has 8k of RAM on
board, while the BJ200 has 48k. This can be partitioned, according to the
printer driver you are using, as buffer and downloadable font storage.

The Canon supports its own driver or that for the Epson. This is selected
by some of the 12 dip switches under a discrete cover on top of the
printer. Which driver you use also determines how many fonts are
available, graphics quality, and the sizes of the buffer partitions.

On the B100 there are 33 dip switches with a template under the flap for
quick reference on how to set them for paper size, font and so on. The
Fujitsu is driven by the Workbench Preferences HP_Deskjet driver. With the
Canon you can use the Epson LQ driver, or you can apply to Canon for an
Amiga/BJ10 driver.

Although these drivers will work satisfactorily for text, they are no
substitute for custom written software when it comes to graphics. This is
also something that WB1.3 users will have to invest in if they want the
best from either printer, as the drivers of that OS are just not good
enough.

Wolf Faust is a gentleman in Germany who appears to have devoted his life
to writing drivers that work with the Amiga. He is responsible for the
BJ10 driver that Canon supplies free on request, but if you want that
extra bit of quality then you should invest in his CanonStudio.

He has also written a marvellous piece of software to control other
printers, including Lasers and the Hewlett Packard inkjet range. Called
'Studio' it was developed from CanonStudio and has the ability to do
things you only thought possible with more expensive printers (see the May
issue of Amiga Mart for a full review).

It and the Canon specific version are for WB2.0 and 3.0 only. Earlier OS
users will have to upgrade or buy TURBOprint Professional to get anywhere
near these in terms of excellence. Details at the end.

The Canon is back to front, while the Fujitsu is front to back. I am
referring here to the paper path. The auto sheet feeder on the BJ200 makes
life extremely easy. On the B100 you have to load single sheets.

This is done by inserting the page into the slot at the front and pressing
'form feed' so that the drive rollers can grab the paper. The fold down
guide is there to help you align the edge correctly.  If you have
misaligned your sheet by a fraction, this error is exaggerated by the time
the finished page is ejected at the back. Result - lopsided text.

Print speeds are double on the Canon. This is due to its new 16-bit
technology. A page of A4 text takes under 30 seconds, compared to the
B100's minute. In the Fujitsu manual the printer is stated to be a 90
page/hour product. Well, it sounds a lot better put that way.

The difference in text quality from the B100, against the BJ200, is
imperceptible. This shows that you cannot tell 300x300 from 360x360 dpi in
this fashion. This applies to graphics too, but the Fujitsu was let down
by 'banding'.

This effect is caused by misfeeding of the paper during a graphics dump.
It manifests itself as either thin white lines where the printer has moved
the paper a fraction of an inch too much, or as thin black lines where it
the paper has not been moved enough causing 'overstrike'.  In this case I
suffered from white lines, but I think that the problem was exacerbated by
one of the ink nozzles being blocked.

The Fujitsu's Hewlett Packard type cartridge overdoes it with the ink
slightly. The last few lines of text are issued wet whereas on the Canon
no such 'effect' is noticeable. Unless, of course, you immediately run
your finger over it.

Too much ink causes text to 'bleed' on cheap paper, while heavy graphics
dumps make even good paper fell damp. The Canon does not suffer this
problem, outputting dense graphics with ease. Its cartridge managed 700k
characters compared with the Fujitsu's 500k. The Fujitsu is not
recommended for this kind of use.

Both machines accept envelopes, the BJ200 having a height adjustment
levers for both the printhead/paper gap and the sheet feeder.

Comparing the recommended prices of these two machines it would come as no
surprise if I said 'go for the Canon'. The extra £50 gives you an auto
sheet feeder, Epson emulation, and a larger buffer. These same features
added to the Fujitsu B100 would set you back at least another £200,
pushing it into the £500+ bracket - hardly 'low cost' as the Press Release
describes it (actually this is 'low cost' for all those corporate mugs who
use Windows(TM)).

After looking at numerous PC magazines the cheapest I found that the
printer can be bought for is £159 plus VAT, so it pays to shop around AND
ignore recommended prices.

The Canon portable BJ10ex bubblejet - about £210 inc. VAT from Amiga
dealers - now becomes a serious rival.

Text is fine from both machines, it's just that the Amiga is a good
graphics computer and therefore you need a printer that can do good
graphics.

CanonStudio - includes font download program -  is £15, and Studio (£49.95
- NOT £49.25 as quoted in the May issue of Amiga Mart) - both WB2.0 and
WB3.0 ONLY! - are distributed exclusively by:

JAM 75 Greatfields Drive Uxbridge UB8 3QN

An uprated Canon printer driver disk can also be obtained from JAM for an
extra £3.

WB1.3 users should consider TURBOprint Professional (£49.95) from most
good software suppliers, or contact HB Marketing on 0753 686000.

                Britain's Revenge?  The Uploads of August
                              by @{" Nick Cook " link nick}

"King George was right," Cosgrove stared morosely into his gin and tonic.
The ice cubes tinkled momentarily against their glass prison. "Bloody
yanks. They only won that war because of the frogs, er, French."

"Let bygones be bygones," responded the Colonel airily. "Well, we can
pretend. After all, the Revolution was over 200 years ago."

"But we'll get our vengeance," Cosgrove muttered into his drink. "Slowly,
in a deliciously devious, dastardly way."

The Colonel examined the end of his cigar as though it was a work of art.
"How, pray tell?"

Cosgrove, his eyes gleaming with an unholy light, leaned over to the
Colonel and whispered. "We'll send the Yanks demos."

The Colonel blanched. "Good God, sir, no! Not that! That's...that's
inhuman!"

"Yes, yes, demos!" Cosgrove sunk back in his leather arm chair. "Those
Amiga-created music videos that push the envelope, as the computer chaps
would say. Animation, music, all blended together!" Cosgrove's grotesque
smile resembled a death's head. "Those creative demos will make them glad
they picked the Amiga as their platform of choice."

He gripped the arms of the chair so tightly his knuckles turned white.
"But here's the best part! Those silly ex-colonists _won't_ be able to run
those bloody things, try as they might!" Veins popped out in Cosgrove's
forehead. A hysterical giggle bubbled forth from his lips. "No! No! Better
yet! _Some_ machines will run the demos, while others won't! Those bloody
yanks will go balmy trying to get them to run! What delicious revenge! Ha,
ha, ha, ha! Those fools, they'll probably think its a conspiracy from the
Trilateral Commission! Ha, ha! No, we'll say they came from Finland!"

Cosgrove's laughter blurred into a high pitched howl, punctuated by gasps
of breath. The other club members glared icily over the tops of their
London Times. The Colonel grabbed the gin and tonic and dashed it in
Cosgrove's face.

"Steady on, man!" The Colonel ordered.

Cosgrove gasped a couple of times and his tense body relaxed. He pulled a
monogrammed handkerchief from his breast pocket and dabbed his face dry.
"Thanks, old chap. I needed that."

"Now no more of the nonsense about demos," the Colonel sat back in his
chair and puffed on his cigar. "Bloody fine idea as it is," he said
quietly. Then he chuckled.

Virtual Dreams (20526 VIRTUALDREAMS242.DMS 597248 bytes) is a forty-five
minute download for the adventurous only. Using DMS is an endeavor in
itself (remember to ignore those "Fatal Error" messages). Postings left in
the HELP! category seems to indicate that some other people have been
successful in getting the demo to run. Alas, not I. My A3000 has a
profound dislike for this demo (or vice versa). By manipulating the
various settings on Degrader, I could control how long it took for my
machine to crash. But I inevitably greeted the guru. On a stock A500, the
demo was reminiscent of a 1960s psychedelic trip colliding with an MRI.

The Steller demo (20488 ASSI_BAN.LHA 34816 bytes) featured an excellent,
professional-looking logo, then the viewer takes an impressive flight
through a custom rotating, zooming fractal. End of Demo on my 3000,
regardless of Degrader's settings. On a plain vanilla 500, the demo
continued on to a dancing mannequin accompanied by a superb Caribbean-
flavored soundtrack. Good stuff.

Chrome's demo (20490 ASSI_CHR.LHA 40960 bytes) worked fine on my 3000,
but, alas, was pretty tame stuff. A graphic, functioning magnifying glass
floats over puzzle motif pictures of credits and greetings. There's also a
plasma cloud that appeared in jigsaw pieces. Not much gut wrenching
excitement here, although those with more of a graphics/programming mind
may find the magnifying glass schtick interesting.

One demo (20489 ASSI_BEY.LHA 27648 bytes) refused to work on my 3000, but
was fine on the 500. The Beyond Force effort focused on some nice morphs,
as well as a dazzling tunnel of light effect.

Crystal's (20617 MELONTETRIS.LHA 35200 bytes) graphics ran on the 3000,
albeit mutely. On the 500, the demo featured dancing geometric shapes, and
a nifty, floating glass ball mirroring Melon's name. The erstwhile
"Russian Theme" bordered on the obnoxious, however.

A solid, driving musical theme matched with ever-changing, soft abstract
images marked Legend's work (20616 LEGEND.LHA 31488 bytes) on the 500.
Crash-o-matic on the 3000.

Compact's intro (20620 SPACEINTRO.LHA 32256 bytes) showed a spacecraft
orbiting a red planet (don't tell NASA), while various greetings scrolled
across the bottom. Dull.

Sco-Pex (20619 SCOOPEX.LHA 22016 bytes) offered a driver's eye view of a
wild ride through a virtual landscape (white columns and triangular green
trees, that sort of thing). I wanted to deposit a quarter to start play.
But not on a 3000.

The demos by Humane (20495 ASSI_HUM.LHA 35456 bytes) and Genocide (20495
ASSI_GEN.LHA 40832 bytes) are all right, if not particularly exciting.
Humane's graphics are interesting dot patterns (this seemed to be all the
rage for this batch of demos), and Genocide's repeated, with different
palettes the same graphic--a man running in a stencil of the group's name-
-while typing out some text. Nice, but nothing to write home about.

Cyberdance (20492 ASSI_CYB.LHA 34688 bytes) featured the most interesting
music of the bunch: it sounded like a snake charmer after too much
caffeine. The graphics consisted of pixelated, spinning skulls, among
others. Unusual demo.

20493 ASSI_EPS.LHA (35072 bytes) is Epsilon's wild, pulsating entry.
Patterns, silhouettes, and images flashed on the screen, accompanied by a
upbeat score. Its almost a disco flashback. Quick, send out for a hot
fudge pizza!

My top pick was Darkness' demo (20528 FIM.LHA 284288 bytes). A spectacular
combination of sight and sound. Fractals, what appears to be retroscoped
animation, flashing text..whoa! In some ways, it resembled a frenetic
version of the James Bond movie credit sequences. This one's worth the
download time (just remember: like all demos, this one may not like
accelerated machines, or 3000s or 4000s; it ran fine on a stock 500). By
the way, rate this one PG for a full-frontal nude lady.

But beware of Cosgrove's warning! Some demos not only require just a
68000, but one with more than one meg of memory. 20621 TSL-AIR.LHA 342912
bytes, 20496 ASSI_NAG.LHA 31232 bytes, and 20527 PARADIGMA.LHA 257536
bytes fall into this realm. PARADIGMA informs you that you're out of
memory; the other two unpack (I assume that from the flashing mouse
arrow), then sit there, doing nothing on a 1 meg 500. When I loaded them
on my 4 meg 3000, these demos loaded, started---and crashed.

ON THE UTILITY FRONT:

Resize (20631 RESIZE.LHA 13952 bytes) is an utility to change the
dimensions of the shell window. The big selling point for Resize is that
its font-sensitive.

What to create screens like the *StarShip*'s opening screen? Try ProANSI
(20576 PROANI114.LHA 56320 bytes). This Shareware program "paints" with
keyboard characters. Finished screens can be in color and can even be
animated. Your artwork is exportable as ASCII, making ProANSI a method to
shoehorn graphics into programs that normally don't support them (e.g.,
text editors, WordPerfect, console devices). Pretty simple to use, as well.

SPYING ON AGNUS, DENISE, GARY...

The Amiga Real Time Monitor (20575 ARTM17.LHA 45824 bytes), by Dietmar
Jansen  &  F.J. Mertens, is for you true Nosey Parkers. The program
displays and, for the technically adventurous and/or adept, controls
various activities in your Amiga. The point and click interface lets you
check out tasks, their priorities, windows, libraries, devices, resources,
memory, and more. ARTM is fully supported by Intuition. It works under
WB1.3 and WB2.x properly, but requires Arp.library 39.+

On the other hand, if you want to make files safe from prying eyes, try
EnC (20641 ENC10.LHA 14464 bytes). Jon Lochner's CLI program encyrpts
files using what is billed as an impossible-to-break coding method.
(Whispering into his pen) "Open Channel D..."

YAKITY, YAK (DON'T TALK BACK!)

YAK (20595 YAK151.LHA 96000 bytes) is not a picture of the hairy goat-like
mammal, rather it is an acronym for "Yet Another Kommodity". Pop this into
your WBStartup drawer and you replace the "standard", separate Commodore
Commodities with a small, all-in-one Commodity which includes: AutoPoint
(activates the window under the pointer), AutoPop (brings the active
window to the front), Cycle screens using the mouse, mouse and screen
blanking, hotkeys, among others goodies. YAK can be highly configured, and
only has differences of opinion with AMOS (although the author Martin
Scott provides a work around). I found the docs, complete as they are, a
little to complicated for their AmigaGuide format; I sometimes got lost.
To be honest, my first reaction to YAK was "eh, so what." But after using
it for a while, I've changed my mind. YAK makes the Workbench a much
easier place to work.

SACREBLEAU! ZE FILE! SHE IZ GONE!

ARestaure (20522 ARESTAURE21.LHA 18304 bytes) undeletes those files you
pushed into magnetic oblivion by accident. It uses a point-and-click
interface (check out the neat way author Jehan-Yves handles English,
French, and German), searches the indicated disk, and restores files to
the RAM: t directory. Shareware: 50 French Francs.

@Node Jim " About Jim Meyer "

JIM MEYER was one of the first consumers to take an Amiga home, and
he hasn't been without one (or two or three) since.  When Jim isn't
working in multimedia or rendering or writing music or morphing on his
Amiga, he's writing about it.  Despite being the Editor of ViewPort, Jim
also finds time to write a column for LiveWire, articles for Compute's
Amiga Gazette, and user manuals, while precariously balancing a Wok in
one hand and a bass guitar in the other.

@Node Peg " About Peg Herrington "

Peg Herrington, who can be found in the *StarShip* when she's not pounding
out another issue of GEnie's LiveWire magazine, recently applied for
authorization to change her name to J.Peg Herrington. She is an original
Amigan, having experienced it when it was called the Lorraine in a hidden
booth in an exhibit at a Chicago trade show. Her claim to fame is having
eaten a hamburger cooked by Jay Miner in his very own kitchen.

@Node deb " About deb Christensen "

If you think telecommunicating is impersonal, then you've never talked with
Deb Christensen online. It's an experience you won't soon forget. Known far
and wide as *deb!*, she's been online since the early 1980s and even survived
running the telecommunications division of Commmodore Business Machines at
West Chester. An Amiga artist and musician, many of *deb!*'s popular
creations may be downloaded from the *StarShip* Library.

@Node Syl "About Sylvia Lutnes"

SYLVIA LUTNES - also known as Crickets - attended Hunter College in Manhattan,
where she majored in Art, Philosophy, and Geology.  When that didn't
pan out, she studied music at Dalcroze Music School, and was even
observed singing Christmas carols on a NY subway.  Syl finally came
to her senses and discovered computers, became a programmer, and took
up with her Amiga.  Syl hosts the Graphics conference every Sunday in
the *StarShip* conferencing area.

@Node Nick "About Nick Cook"

NICK COOK uses his Amigas to handle tasks from the mundane of word
processing and spreadsheets, to the creative tasks of creating
visuals for presentations to educational and professional groups. He
is the newsletter editor for Amiga Friends Users Group of Huntington
Beach, CA. Nick enjoys using CanDo and AMOS to create utilities and
educational programs for the Amiga. In his spare time, he vaccuums
cat hair out of the keyboard.

@Node matt "About Matt Davidian"

Matt graduated from CSU Fresno with a B.S. in Computer Science.  He has
two Amigas (a 3000 & a 1200) at home but has to slave away writing
accounting programs for DOS machines during the day.  His ultimate goal is
to write Amiga software but he says "I recently acquired one of those
'life' thingies and it's eating up quite a bit of my time..."

@Node eric "About Eric Penn"

Eric Penn, who goes by the unlikely nickname of STUPID, has been an Amiga
enthusiast since the introduction of the A2000 in late 1987.  Initially
attracted because of the entertainment possibilities, he has become
enamoured of the technical aspects of the machine, dabbling in
programming in 'C', assembler and the occasional quick-and-dirty ARexx
script. With the purchase of a Supra 2400 in 1988, telecommunications has
become his primary passion.  He operated a local BBS for three years
before it succumbed to the pressures of the real world.  He remains very
active on many local BBS's, as well as GEnie's Amiga RoundTable, and has
been known to spend considerable amonts of time in the online gaming
areas of several networks.

                               About This Issue

This issue wouldn't have been possible without DCTV - for the digitized
images - and a LOT of coffee.  Many thanks to the Intrepid Trio of Nick,
Matt, and Eric, for providing superb coverage of the World of Commodore-
Amiga.

Products used for this issue:  DCTV and Brilliance, from Digital
Creations, ImageFX from GVP, AdPro, from ASDG, TurboText, from Oxxi,
TransWrite and TransSpell, from Gold Disk, Directory Opus, from
INOVAtronics, and Emplant, from Utilities Unlimited.  And you thought
it was easy!

@Node setup

If you want to use a viewer other than WDisplay and you see it on one of the
buttons below, click on that button.  There's no real magic involved here.
All we do is change the Environment Variable we use (viewer) to call the
viewer.  If you don't see your viewer on the list below, you can simply
flip to a Shell and issue the command yourself:

 SetEnv viewer <name of your viewer>

Note that this viewer MUST be in your current path!


    @{" Multiview " system "SetEnv viewer Multiview"}
    @{"    VT     " system "SetEnv viewer VT"}
    @{"  Mostra   " system "SetEnv viewer Mostra"}
    @{"   View    " system "SetEnv viewer View"}
    @{"  C-Show   " system "SetEnv viewer C-Show"}
    @{"   Show    " system "SetEnv viewer Show"}
    @{" SuperView " system "SetEnv viewer SuperView"}
    @{"    SV     " system "SetEnv viewer SV"}
    @{" Display39 " system "SetEnv viewer Display39"}
    @{"  Display  " system "SetEnv viewer Display"}
    @{" WDisplay  " system "alias WDisplay WDisplay"}

 One more note:  Environment Variables have been part of the system since
 Workbench 1.3.  To utilize them, your startup-sequence makes a directory
 named ENV and performs an assign (Assign ENV: Ram:ENV).  If you have any
 problems, please ensure that ENV has been created and is properly assigned.
 Then, make sure that AmigaDOS can find everything.  ViewPort and the
 graphics should be in the same directory, and this should be your Current
 Directory.  Finally, AmigaDOS must be able to find the viewer you choose,
 either by searching the Current Directory or the Paths.

 If you encounter any problems (other than a balky viewer that doesn't
 like our directives), please @{" contact " link jim} me.
