Hello,<P>

Welcome to the second issue of the Amiga Nutta games magazine.<P>

We'll start off this issue with a little look at the Amiga games market in
general.  Many people are saying how dead it is and that it is all doom & gloom.
Well, let me tell you this now, it aint!  Just have a look at the games featured
in this issue and browse the release schedule (Even the CD-ROM is packed with
games) and you will see let things ain't as bad as some people make out.<P>

Ok, the big commercial companies have buggered off and left us, but there place
has been taken by new companies that actually care about the Amiga and WANT to
see it succeed.  You might have trouble finding Amiga games in the shops at the
moment, but even this, to an extent is being worked on.  Guildhall have managed
to secure a deal that will see their re-releases get into shops such as HMV,
Game and Electronic Boutique.<P>

Many of you may find mail ordering a chore and too much effort just to buy a
game, well don't!  There are many games coming out way (Foundation, OnEscapee,
Myst, Wasted Dreams, Forgotten Forever) that are almost certainly going to
be worth buying and the plain fact is that many of them won't be available in
the shops, the only way to get them will be mail order.  To help you, I will
soon be building a list of mail order companies from which you can buy Amiga
games, you'll then have no excuse not to buy the latest games.<P>

Now, back to the magazine.  There isn't a hugh amount of news this issue,
hopefully enough to keep you going for now though.  Next issue I will be doing a
special round-up of all the Command & Conquer like games we have comong our way,
and believe me, there are quite a few.  I will also be starting a few new
sections soon too, a Highscore league in which you send you best times/scores
for each game and see if others can beat it and a Developers/Publishers contact
section.<P>

I haven't received any letters or tips from you lot yet, so get writing! :)<P>

Anyway, until the next issue....<P>
