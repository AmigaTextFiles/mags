Scions of a Forgotten World is another in the long list of future Vulcan
releases.  For those of you who do not know it is a real-time strategy game that
is similar to the likes of Warcraft on the PC.<P>

A demo for this game was released quite a long time ago, since then little has
been heard about it.  Vulcan signed up the game about a month ago, but they seem
to be keeping details about the game close to there chests (Like many of there
other games I might add).<P>

In each of the levels that are contained in the game it is your job to wipe out
the enemy.  First, however, you need to build up your settlement, you do this by
gathering minerals which allow you to build new buildings, weapons, provide food
and increase your army.  When you have done this it is time to go and attack the
enemy, by noe you will be hoping that they haven't managed to exapnd as much as
you have, of course you can find this out beforehand by deploying spies.<P>

To run the game will require AGA or Graphics Card equipt Amiga with at least an
020 CPU, a hard-drive, 2Mb Chip RAM and 4Mb FAST RAM.  A 4x CD-ROM will also be
required so you still have a 2 speed one it's time to upgrade.  The game will be
completly system friendly, will allow a dynamic screensize (320x200 all the way
up to 8192x6144) and will also include AHI sound support.<P>

A release date for the game has not yet been set, it is still quite a long way
off.<P>
