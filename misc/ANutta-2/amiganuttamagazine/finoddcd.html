I have just received news that Vulcans Final Odyssey will no longer be released
as a floppy disk title.  Due to it's size it will now be released on CD-ROM
only.<P>

The is the latest move which see the Amiga market going more and more towards
being CD-ROM only.  Vulcan now have only two games scheduled for an Amiga
floppy release, Jet-Pilot Expansion Disk and 3D world creator.  It is now very unlikely
that any of there future games will be released on floppy.<P>

For those of you who do not no, Final Odyssey is an Action/Adventure in which
you have to destroy an evil creature as well as releasing people who have been
imprisioned.  On the way you have to solve many complex puzzles and mysteries as
well as destroying a wealth of creatures using the weaponery supplied.<P>

The game consists of 5 different worlds, containing 100's of screens of action. 
Each world contains it's own unique nasties all of which have there own
artificial intelligence, to combat these you have a wide range of weaponry such
as Crossbows, Chain-Guns and Plasma Rifles.<P>

The game will hopefully be released in September.  To run, the game requires any
Amiga with 2Mb RAM, a hard-drive and a CD-ROM drive.  The game utlilizes any
extra RAM or a faster processor if available.  As the game is on CD is contains
full speach as well as on-line documentation.  Vulcan will also be distribruting
there full range of demos on the CD.
