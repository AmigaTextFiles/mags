I'm sure many of you have already heard lots about this game.  It sounds a very
exciting game that is in the Elite 2 - Frontier mould.  Before now I have not
been very up to date with new information concerning this game, from now, this
will not be the case and I will be bringing you all the latest information as
soon as I get it.  As some of you may not know much about the game, below is an
outline of what it is about.<P>

The first work on Explorer 2260 started in November last year, although the
ideas for such a game had been in the authors head for a while before this. 
Basically you take the role of a space pilot who has to make a living by
trading, mining and completing a wide range of missions.  The game concept is
quite close to Frontier but Explorer takes it much further.<P>

Most of the authors time since work started has been spent on the planning of
the game and on coding programs to aid development, currently there is very
little to show in terms of screenshots etc, this however, will hopefully change
soon as work on the actual game itself begins.<P>

The amount of ideas that the author wants to incorporate into the game is
amazing, so mush in fact that I find it hard that the game will be ready anytime
in the next two years.  However, the programmer has quite a large amount of
support in the form of graphics artists, assistant programmers and musicians.<P>

As well as the basic trading and exploring part of the game there will also be a
massive military part in the game.  There will be a range of different factions
that you can join.  The missions that will be offered to you include Patrol,
Hunt, Escort and of course Destroy.  You will also be able to take part in wars
with other factions, even going as far as you being put in charge of a space
station.  With the game including over 20 different races there is always going
to be some action.<P>

The graphics engine behind Explorer 2260 will be very advanced.  It will be
fully lightsourced, shaded, texture mapped engine.  The user will be able to
adjust the detail level so the game can ran at a decent speed on there machine. 
The  majority of Explorers graphic rountines will be implemented via libraies,
making it easy to produce differbet versions of the code, currently they are
aiming to make both and AGA and a CyberGFX version.<P>

Hopefully I will be able to bring you more info about the game and even some
screenehots giving an idea of what the game will look like soon, currently a CD
only release sometime around Mid '98 is looking on the cards.<P>
