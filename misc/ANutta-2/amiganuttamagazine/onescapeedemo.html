A couple of weeks ago I brought you the news that Sadeness Software had signed
up Invictus Teams excellent looking game, OnEscapee.  Well, I can now inform you
that a demo of this game has been made available and should be on Aminet by the
time you read this.<P>

OnEscapee is another in the line of eagerly awaited CD-ROM releases for the
Amiga.  Only now are us Amiga users beginning to see the benefit of the CD-ROM
medium with games like OnEscapee using them to the full.<P>

The demo of the game itself is over 5Mb in size, this has been cut down from the
original demo which was a massive 50Mb in size!  One you download it you will
notice why there has been so much said about this game, the graphics are
excellent and the animation really has to be seen to be believed.  You thought
Flashback was good, well, you ain't seen nothing yet.<P>

The charactor moves along very smoothly, and is able to perform a wide range of
actions.  One thing that I did notice is that there is a small pause between you
moving the joystick and the charactor moving, I would expect this could make
things a little tricky if the action gets hectic.<P>

The special effects that the gamme boasts can also be seen in the demo, such
things as rain (Which looks excellent) and special light effects all help to
make this game a very good visual experience.<P>

Due to the size that the demo has been cut down too, it is quite limited.  It
does, however, gove you a nice insight into how good this game could be.  The
demo consists of two scenes, the Dumping Ground and Part of the Base Section. 
In the full demo (which will be available on magazine CD-ROM's) there is also the
Quarry Cave section and an underwater part.<P>

Sadeness are looking to release the Amiga version around October time with the PC version
to follow a couple of months later.<P>

For those of you who own Graphics cards, the game doesn't currently support
them.  However, after the full game has been released a patch will be made
available free of charge that will introduce support for them.  The game won't
really benefit from a graphics card in anyway, it's just so ECS owners with
cards will be able to play the game.<P>

To download the demo click on the link below:-<P>

<B>NOTE: Due to some last minute changes that were made to the demo, the game
will not run properly.  All that needs be done is the copying of some files from
one directory to another.  The below script will do this for you, just put it in
the OnEscapee directory after un-archiving and  run it.<P>
