Some exciting comes from Guildhall Leisure regarding there future Amiga plans.
The long-time Amiga publisher in co-operation with Epic Marketing will be
bringer a number of Amiga CD-ROMS to the highstreet.<P>

Game, HMV and Electronics Boutique will now be stocking a range of Amiga
CD-ROM's.  The games in these plans include Formula One Grand Prix, Theme Park,
Dune 2, Super Skidmarks as well as a few others.<P>

They will also be releasing Cililization CD.  This will include both the AGA and
ECS versions of the game, both playable from the CD.  This is an excellent game
that everyone should have, anyone that has played the multiplayer FreeCiv over
the Internet will love the original Civilization.<P>

On top of this they will also be releasing a re-hashed version of Gloom.  It
will be called Gloom 3 and will consist of the original Gloom Deluxe engine as

Hopefully Guildhall will continue this by releasing some new games on the CD
