============================================================================

  Welcome to issue 6 of WhatIff? and what an issue we have for you this 
  time round.  To start off with we welcome @{"Ivan Sorensen" link ivansorensen} to the WhatIFF?
  writing staff.  For his first issue  he has written two articles:  
  @{"Floppy Disks and You" link floppygotek} and @{"Authenticity, the Amiga and You" link realamiga} bringing his
  expertise and knowledge to the the magazine.  Also just for this issue we 
  also have two submissions from @{"Carl Svensson's" link carlsvensson}: @{"ARexx Stems as Mock Data" link arexxstems}
  and @{"Little Things That Made The Amiga Great" link littlethings}.  Even though his submissions 
  are just for this issue we look forward to him writing for the magazine 
  again the near future.  

  As if that is not enough we have reviews of the A500 Mini, Infinity Music 
  Player v3, AmiSSL Classic 5.2 and The LightWave Book.  The Brilliance and
  LightWave 101 tutorials continue with the latter look at the LW-Config
  file and how it can help in streamlining your work process.

  @{"John Scolieri" link johnscolieri} is back with an article for Amiga OS4.1 users with a
  tutorial on reading and creating ADFs and @{"Kevin Saunders" link kevinsaunders} 
  updates us on his latest 
  game projects regarding the Vampire series of computers. As you can see
  this issue is quite packed and this is all thanks the writers for their
  amazing contributions to the magazine.
 
  Some of the more eagle eyed of you might have noticed a new section on 
  the main page: @{"Amiga Vendors" link amigavendors} this list will be updated each time a 
  anew Amiga dealer is found.  If you are selling Amiga goods and are not on
  the list then contact us so we can add your details.

  I hope you will enjoy this issue and what it has to offer, it is incredible
  to think we have made it to issue 6 already.  While there are other more
  professional printed Amiga magazines available I hope that we can offer
  something a bit different to them.  If you have any suggestions or want
  to contribute to the magazine in anyway please contact us at:

  @{b}How I Rediscovered My Floppy Disks@{ub}

  What are, among many other nice things, the advantages of having a baby? 
  You get to know your surroundings from a completely new perspective! On 
  our living room bookshelf, which is IKEA of course ;), there are two 
  separate compartments on the bottom: one is filled with magazines, hiking 
  maps and travel books, the other with my two Amiga floppy disk boxes and 
  quite a few other boxes.
 
  Currently, my child has developed two habits, which results in both 
  shelves being completely cleared out :) He has a preference for hiking 
  maps, which are unfolded with great pleasure and don't consist of only 
  one piece. In addition, he also enjoys floppy disk boxes. There are two 
  of them: the Verbatim "Deluxe" version, which offers a small plastic 
  cover for each disk (like Boeder) and the Profex. Here is my complete 
  collection: 

  Now I don't know if it's sacrilege to keep floppy disks not in 
  professional plastic boxes/slipcases, but just in the original cardboard 
  boxes.  However, it was the trigger for me to dig back into old memories. 

  Vividly I can remember the various rummaging through boxes and walls in 
  the local electronics store, in which the disks of various suppliers were 
  presented. And every time the question came up: do I take the cheap 
  no-name parts or do I treat myself to a box of the brand suppliers? 
  As it turned out, I gladly reached for Boeder & Co and treated myself to 
  a variety of colourful disks. Even in the 90s, one was already aware of 
  sustainability, see KAO. And the no-name boxes were semi-professionally 
  glued together and thus used as a kind of big box. 

  Now some of you may not believe it, but a considerable part of my floppy 
  disk (collection) contains software from Aminet.  Of course, like many 
  others, I used a modem on my Amiga 1200!  First, a 28.8k modem, which 
  drove me crazy, because I never managed to get a noise-free dial-up, and 
  later finally a 56k modem. At that time, in the mid-90s, I was studying 
  and Aminet was the best place where I could get software quickly and for 
  free - yes, at that time dial-up at home still cost something though ;)

  Where is all the download software from Aminet?  In the computer cabinet
  of course!.  It felt like there was a new version of Voyager and Co every 
  week and I could hardly keep up... 

  Are floppy disks now just an outdated greeting from times long past? I 
  have to admit, it's been a while since I put the last floppy disk into the 
  A1200 (but that also has to do with the current "computer offspring"). On 
  the one hand, of course, they consume a lot of space. For the little bit 
  that's on there...On the other hand, it's very pleasant to have an 
  antithesis to this "WLAN/streaming/'file-shuffling' world. And even if it 
  might seem contradictory regarding the 'wild copy times' on the Amiga: 
  doesn't such a disk better symbolise the efforts and value behind the 
  development of the software? In any case, my curiosity is aroused and I 
  will be rummaging around in the boxes some more ...

============================================================================

  @{b}Product Name@{ub}                    
  The LightWave 3D Book - Tips, Techniques, and Ready-to-Use Objects
  2nd Edition

  @{b}The Lightwave 3D Book Review@{ub}
  LightWave 3D is an very user friendly programme, especially when put
  against the likes of Imagine.  However to truly get at the true
  power that LightWave affords a little guidance is needed.  There are
  a large selection of books for the modern versions of LightWave 
  centred on Windows and Mac OS computers, however there have not been
  any new books written about LightWave 3D and the Amiga.
  
  The majority of the books that have recently been written about Amiga
  concentrate on games and the history of Commodore.  Where it comes to
  guides or tutorials the options are a bit more limited.  In the mid 90s
  after Lightwave 3D was released as a standalone programme there were a 
  number of tutorial books written.  I was lucky enough to find one that
  advertised in Amiga World and had it shipped over the States.

  This book had some great tutorials and hints for beginners and veteran
  users alike.  Since starting the LightWave 101 series I have been
  wanting to dive back into the book again to help me with the series
  but unfortunately the original book has been lost to time.  Having
  had an unsuccessful search for it on the internet I decided to find
  an alternative book.
 
  After much searching I realised that there are not many books that 
  deal with the Amiga and Lightwave 3.5.  However, after much  an
  exhausting search I came across a book titled 'The Lightwave 3D Book' 
  released in 1997.  

  This book peaked my interest due to two factors, it was created by the 
  editors of LightWavePro Magazine which I had read a few times in the
  past, and they had often mentioned the Amiga and the book mentions
  LightWave 3.5 which as far as I know was only on the Amiga.  

  With my hopes high I ordered the book from Amazon for the princely sum 
  of $10.00 plus  shipping.  It should be noted that this book can also 
  be picked up for quite a bit cheaper as noted in the cover the of the 
  book when it was sold for (Ahem) $1.00. 

  @{b}The Book@{ub}
  The book itself is roughly A4 size but a slightly wider, it comes in at
  287 pages and includes a CD-Rom with textures, objects, plugins and
  applications (including ones for the Amiga!).  It is a hefty book with
  thick pages and is printed in black & white.  

  Since this is a collection of guides from a magazine the contents are 
  organised by subject instead of publishing date, as was done in the 
  first edition.  This makes it easier to jump in and out of the book and 
  find something you need based on a particular topic.  

  The tutorials themselves are quite detailed and relatively easy to 
  follow, in some instances there are grey scale photos but in general 
  they are not needed due to the precise writing.

  If you are a beginner to LightWave 3D this book however will not be for 
  you.  The articles presume a certain affinity and experience with 
  LightWave 3D which is understandable since they come from a magazine
  that was solely dedicated to LightWave.

  This brings me onto the writing style, while the topics covered are
  serious in nature, the writing tone is light with humour often sprinkled
  into the articles.  This helps make something that could be quite dry 
  reading into an enjoyable experience in itself.

  The authors themselves are quite the heavyweights in the 3D animation 
  world having worked on Babylon 5, seaQuest and RoboCop The Series to 
  name just a few shows.

  It makes for a fascinating read almost 30 years later as the animators
  detail the hurdles and tricks they used on some of the biggest shows
  in the 90s.  Reading about them using our lovely Amiga in the process
  just makes it so much more enjoyable!

  Even if you are not interested in learning about animating in LightWave
  or are a beginner the articles about the creation process are a great 
  read in themselves.  It is something that I would like to see more of 
  featured in the Amiga history books.  The Amiga realy was revolutionary
  with the Video Toaster and LightWave and deserves more recognition for
  what it contributed to TV and movies in the 90s.

  For those of you who are interested in learning more about LightWave
  techniques then this book has a very good learning curve and each
  tutorial is explained in simple enough English as to not make it too
  hard to follow.  With YouTube having become such a large part of life
  it is easy to forget how useful a guide book like The LightWave 3D
  book can be.  You can move at your own pace and not have to worry about
  pausing or rewinding the video or even worse, the dreaded pop up 
  adverts right when you are getting to the hard part of the video.

  @{b}The CD@{ub}
  Yes,this book comes with CD and even has some Amiga programmes which
  still manages to surprise me.  

  The drawers on the CD are as follows:

  DEMOS	   :	Some videos/animations done the leading animators of
		the time.	

  DOCS     :    Contains all the Readme files for certain Scenes,
		Objects. 

  LW3_5    :    Specifically for LightWave 3.5 and earlier, it contains
		all the Scenes/Objects/Images configured for the older
		versions of LightWave.

  OTHER    :    Demo of LIGHT-ROM textures, images and objects.

  PLUGINS  :	PowerView Plugins for PC and Amiga!

  PROGRAMS :    Useful programmes for the Amiga and PC.

  SETUPS   :    Setup files for one of the tutorials lised in the book.

  As you can see there is quite a bit of content for the Amiga on the 
  CD-Rom which was a pleasant surprise.  While the Amiga was very much 
  alive for me in 1997 the rest of world had forgot about the Amiga and
  so it is nice to see the Amiga represented so well in the book.

  @{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}
  If you are looking for a book to help you understand the basics of how
  to use LightWave, this is not for you.  However if you already have a
  basic understanding of LightWave and have created some simple objects
  or animations then this book will probably suit you to a T.  The topics
  covered are wide ranging and detailed enough so that you will not have
  too many questions.  The book contains lot of Amiga centric articles 
  as well which is always a plus.  The book can be found quite easily on 
  Amazon or other online bookstores, it can range from very cheap to 
  reasonable.

  There are not many Amiga tutorial books available anymore and if you
  want to learn more about LightWave then this is a book that I highly
  recommend.

  + Easy to read writing style

  @{b}Infinity Module Player (IMP) Review@{ub}
  Listen (to) songs from (the) internet - over 168,000 files! (mods, 
  SIDs, AHXs, XMs...), that is the first in the readme file that is 
  on Aminet.  The brain child of Polish programmer Pawel Nowak, IMP
  can be viewed as an Amiga version of streaming audio software like
  Spotify or Apple Music, but instead of an audio stream the music is
  downloaded straight to your Amiga and played, then when the song has
  finished another one will be downloaded and played and so on.  Not
  streaming as we know it persay but I think something that is uniquely
  Amiga and brimming with potential.  

  Currently there are a number of internet radio stations playing Amiga
  music but it has been limited to the more powerful Amigas or PCs/Mac
  due to the need to decode the audio stream fast enough to be listenable.              

  Luckily a few pioneering individuals realised that it would be possible
  to stream mods directly to the Amiga meaning that the lower spec Amigas
  that were connected to the internet could enjoy 24/7 streaming of the 
  latest and classic mods.  Of the few programmes that have been released 
  Infinity Module Player caught my eye or shall I say ear that is.

  If you are a regular of EAB then you will probably already know about
  the IMP thread, which has the latest updates and fixes posted there
  first.  If not, I recommend heading over to EAB and checking out the 
  thread as it is interesting to see how the programme has evolved from
  something that was originally used mainly by Polish Amiga users to
  something that is being used by Amiga users all over the world.

  This will be a short review and introduction to the Infinity Module 
  Player (IMP).

  @{b}Installation@{ub}
  IMP has gone through several changes since it's inception, starting as
  a programme that ran in the shell it now has a proper interface made
  up up several windows; a command menu, player control, scope, and a
  chat window.

  What raises it above the other mod streamers is its ease of
  installation.  Just download the software from Aminet, copy it to your
  location of choice and double click on the icon.  By default there is
  tool icon so you will need to run it either from the Shell or click again
  on 'Ok' when the execute window pops up.  You will need to have a TCP
  client running in the background but other than that, there is nothing
  else required.  Upon first starting you are taken to a new custom screen
  which seems to be set at PAL Hires screen and asked to create a new
  user name, from then on the user name will be saved not requiring you
  to enter it again.

  While it goes into a custom screen by default you are able to change
  it to a public screen and view it on Workbench.  Other than these few
  steps that is all that is needed to run IMP.

  @{b}In Use@{ub}
  Once you have the programme up and running you have four windows to
  contend with.  The programme by default runs in a custom screen but
  this can be changed to run in any resolution or on the Workbench in a
  Public screen.  I chose to use it on the Workbench since I run my
  Amiga in HIGHGFX: Super HiRes, which gives me plenty of desktop real
  estate to have all of IMP's windows and still have space to open other
  windows and move files around.

  After you have created your user name the programme will not do
  anything until you click on the play button.  This was the only issue
  that I had with the programme and it is probably just me.  However I
  found it a little hard to locate the play button, I was looking for
  something more akin to the traditional Play/Pause button found on
  other music players.  In IMP's case it is just a thin arrow with
  another button with two arrows next to it.  Probably 99% of IMP users
  will not have any trouble with this but it was something that stuck
  out at me.

  Getting back to the layout, I mentioned above the command menu,
  playback, scope and chat windows.  One window in particular that I
  enjoyed was the 'SCOPE' window which shows the four channels and
  tracker patterns.  Having the ability to see how the song is
  structured and plays, creates more personal connection with the music.
  When listening to MP3s or streaming music on PC/Macs you can't see how
  the structure of the music however thanks to the MOD format we can see
  how the music was made and as one who also makes music on the Amiga I
  find this most enjoyable.  However for those who do not have the space
  for the window or are not interested it can be closed and re-opened
  again by clicking on 'SCOPE'.

  Let's take a deeper look at the Menu Window, it is possible to control
  IMP via the menu bar as such all control is done via buttons.  I will
  list each button and what it does:
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  CHAT   - Opens the chat window.
  DISK   - Gives you access to other files held on the IMP server.
  FAVS   - A list of the tracks that you favourited.
  TOPS   - The most played files, click module name to play.
  STASH  - A place to store your own MODS, only available to donators.
  DISCO  - a funky screen with moving colours, simple but fun effect.
  ZGR3D  - A small game that reminds me of Digger.
  SCOPE  - Displays the module patterns.
  HELP   - Did not seem to do anything.
  SEARCH - Find a particular module.
  SAVE   - Save the current MOD to your Amiga.
  TYPE   - Set which format of songs you want to listen to: Modules, Sids,
           AHX, XM, and DBM.
  MODE   - Choose if you want to play only the songs you liked, only with
     	   likes, ones you searched, never played or all songs.
  PREFS  - Palette, Screen, Fonts, Switxh Workbench, LED Filter: On/Off
  TEST   - Tests your network connection speed.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  As you can see there is a lot functionality to IMP that goes beyond a
  simple MOD streamer.  It pays to deep dive into the menu and learn how
  it works and what is possible.

  @{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}
  The idea of a MOD streamer is very appealing, while I wish I had the
  time to search all the MODs myself the reality is that there is just
  too many and not enough time.  Infinity Module Player is the Spotify
  for Amiga MODs, it makes listening to a large library of music as
  simple as clicking a button.  The version that I reviewed v3.355 was
  quite stable and I only experienced one issue where the whole screen
  became garbled in red and yellow.  However after a quick reboot and
  everything was back to normal, the only effect I had was that I lost
  part of this review.

  This software has a mainstay on my Amiga, in fact somuch so that I 
  have ended up buying a mini hifi and have it hooked up to the Amiga 
  24/7, streaming music most of the day, much tothe annoyance of my wife.  

  The ease of use, the multiple functionality, the social aspect and the 
  massive library of MODs makes this one of the best pieces of software I 
  have reviewed of recent.  It is fantastic that the programme is available 
  for free, though I recommend  donating to the author for his hard work.  

  Bottom line, download this now, if you don't have a network connected 
  Amiga, get it connected, and hook your Amiga up to proper speakers and 
  boogy on down to the tunes.  Right time for me to bust some moves!

  @{b}What Is AmiSSL@{ub}
  If you are new to AmiSSL, in a nutshell it is a collaborative effort to
  develop OpenSSL as a shared library for all Amiga systems (Amiga OS, 
  Morph OS, AROS, and so forth).  SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer
  and is the standard technology used for keeping an internet connection
  secure and protecting any sensitive data being sent between two 
  systems.  As such it is now a requirement for any and all websites 
  so if you plan to surf the web on your classic Amiga then  AmiSSL 
  is a necessity.  Lucky for us the library is being distributed  for 
  free via Aminet or the AmiSSL website.

  @{b}In Use@{ub}
  Installation is taken care of with the standard Workbench installer
  and it is simple and quick.  One thing that is different from the last
  version of AmiSSL v4 is that users with the TF1260 060LC cards can now
  install the 060 version.  Previously this would cause Amigas with the 
  LC060 chip to freeze, the reason being the LC has no FPU and the v4 of 
  AmiSSL was most likely looking for a full 060 with FPU.  

  I am happy to report that when I installed v5 and chose 060 the 
  installtion went smoothly.  More so when I tested the latest version of 
  AmiSSL with AmiGemini which requires AmiSSL there was no crash and it 
  was visibly faster than previously.

  It is great to see AmiSSL supporting more hardware and in particular the
  Terrible Fire cards.  If you have an TF1260 with the LC 060 card and wantt
  to browse Gemini capsules or use the latest version of IBrowse then you 
  will need this.

  @{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}
  As a review this is very short and lacking on details however all you
  really need to know is that if you are planning to surf the Internet
  with the latest browsers or AmiGemini, then you need this.  You don't
  have to choose (68020/030/040/080 or MorphOS) anymore if you have
  a TF1260LC card as it seems the 060s without FPUs are also supported.

  @{b}The First New Amiga Since 1996!@{ub}
  Well calling the The A500 Mini as a true new Amiga might be stretching
  the truth a bit but since we have not had a real Amiga since 1996
  beggars can't be choosers as the old saying goes.  You may be wondering
  why we are reviewing the A500 Mini in WhatIFF? since the magazine does
  not cover games, a good question.  Well to be perfectly honest the
  opportunity to review new Amiga hardware in whatever form does not come
  up often, so it was decided to review the mini A500 in the WhatIFF?
  way.

  @{b}First Impressions@{ub}
  The box reminds you right away of the cartoon classics pack that was 
  released in the UK, the colour scheme and layout carry a heavy load
  of nostalgia.  Upon opening the box you are presented with the smallest
  Amiga to date, a lovingly recreated A500.  Under the mini computer you
  can find the mouse and control pad, as you have probably already seen in
  the photos of other reviews the mouse is a slightly smaller re-creation
  of the classic tank mouse that came with the A500s.  The pad is 
  reminiscient of the CD32 pad, this might divide opinion, personally I 
  liked the CD32 pad as it was big and chunky and fit my hands nicely. 
  The A500 Mini version however is a bit smaller and can feel a little
  cramped after long gaming sessions.

  Taking a closer look at the A500 itself, the attention to detail is a 
  delight to behold, all the original lines, font and keyboard details
  are there to take you back to your youth.  Looking at the side you have
  a limited recreation of the floppy disk and on the right the lines of
  the casing joints, unfortunately the side slot cover is missing.  A
  few others have mentioned this and I have to concur that it seems like
  a missed opportunity with the floppy disk area, it would have been nice
  to have an USB slot there when using WHDLoad games.

  On the back you have the HDMI, USB-C, and three USB ports, right away 
  you feel this is a little limited considering if you want to have an
  external keyboard, mouse, joypad and additional games.  The power
  switch is on the back and is a simple push button.  Upon plugging
  everything in and pushing it the red powerlight comes on bringing back
  again a surprising rush of memories, who ever thought seeing a 
  rectangle red LED could be so emotive.

  @{b}Starting Up@{ub}
  After pressing the power button you have a few seconds of a black 
  screen followed by a white screen with the A500 logo and a quick
  bounce of a half boing ball.  Simple but slick and effective.  The
  rest of your A500 mini experience takes place in the game carosele
  move to the left or right to highlight your game.  Press the A 
  button red start a game, you also have 4 game save slots that can 
  be accessed by pushing down, for those extra hard games.

  To access the Options press Menu on the control pad, from here you
  can change the display optons, mouse sensitivity, music volume,
  power LED settings, language, advanced options such as 50 or 60 hz
  and expert mode.  When you use WHDLoad games you will be able to
  change more settings such JIT, changing the way the Copper works
  and more.  The setting options are quite encompassing, going
  beyond the typical settings offered with other mini consoles and
  for this I commend the creators.

  For this review we will not cover the games because what may be junk
  for one is gold for another and we do not review games here.  However
  we will look at what you can do beyond the games and see if the A500
  could be a nice alternative to buying a 'real' Amiga.  As stated above
  it is possible to load WHDLoad games but what if you want to use the
  Amiga for more than games, is that possible with the A500 Mini?

  @{b}Beyond Games@{ub}
  First you will need to prepare a USB thumbdrive, update the A500 Mini
  to the latest firmware and prepare an HDF file.  At the moment the
  A500 Mini does not officially support HDF files but with the latest
  firmware update ADF support is now included.  To access your HDF file
  you will need to bring the Amiberry configure screen up and this can
  be done by editing one of the .uae files.  The easiest way to do this
  is to download any WHDLoad game and keep it in the .lha format.  Play
  the game once on the A500 Mini and then shutdown the mini.  Take the
  USB drive from your mini and look for the game you just played, for
  example if you downloaded and played Lemmings.lha, look for the file
  and below it you will see Lemmings_ol.uae, copy this file over to your
  computer and rename it to .txt.  Now you can edit it as a text file,
  next you will need to add four lines to the top of the text file:

			amiberry.open_gui=F12
                        amiberry.save_state_on_exit=true
			amiberry.ignore_gui=false
			use_gui=yes
  
  Save the file and put the extension back to .uae, most of your probably
  already know what these four lines will do, open the Amiberry configure
  screen.  Now when you run this game, instead of the game starting the
  Amiberry screen will pop up, from here you can change the settings like
  you would as if you were running in WinUAE or UAE for Mac.  Change the
  CPU, chipset, add floppy disks or ... and this is what we are looking
  for add a HDF file.  For my experiment I used ClassicWB LITE, and I am
  happy to say it worked.  From here I was able to run Workbench and use
  the A500 Mini for much more than games.  You will need to find a good
  keyboard and probably a USB hub but this proves that with a little work
  the A500 Mini could become a replacement Amiga.

  What I described above was just a simple example and if you are not
  comfortable changing settings or have not used UAE before then you
  might want to do this with someone else who has experience with Amiga
  emulation software.

  @{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}
  The A500 Mini is a well planned and excuted minature Amiga, it is
  easy to setup for beginners, comes with all the necessary utilities,
  connects to your modern TV and has the ability of add games with the
  minimum of effort and fuss.  As it stands it is a great option for 
  playing Amiga games on your TV or with family.  It is particularly
  relevant today with the prices of Amiga hardware skyrocketing and 
  existing hardware becoming more fragile and rare.  If you want to
  introduce your children to the joys of Amiga gaming without having to
  worry if you will need to take out a loan to pay for repairs if they
  become too excited then the A500 Mini is a great option.

  Beyond the game playing the fact that it can be hacked to use HDF files
  tips it from being a good buy to a fantastic purchase.  In essence you
  have a fully useable Amiga that has USB ports and can be plugged into a 
  modern display without any extra hardware.  Great for the beginner and
  veteran Amiga user alike.    

  @{b}Pros and Cons@{ub}
  + Easy to setup
  + Ability to add games and HDF
  + Relatively cheap compared to real hardware
  + Looks great!
  - Lack of USB ports
  - No working internal keyboard

  @{b}How to read/ write ADF's with AmigaOS4.1@{ub}

  Amiga Disk Files,or more commonly known as ADF's, are used by Amiga
  users to backup their original floppies as well as disk virtualization 
  i.e. access an ADF files on Workbenches if it were a physical drive.

  When I first bought my AmigaOne X1000 motherboard over a decade ago
  my trusty Amiga 1200 at the time had some hardware issues I couldn't
  figure out and a ton of disks which sadly were never backed up...I mean 
  I knew I had my 1200 hard drive backed up but never thought about
  backing up my disks until my Amiga broke down. My X1000 
  didn't have a connector to directly use my external Amiga disk drive 
  so in order to use my Amiga disks I had to purchase a Catweasel floppy
  controller from Individual Computers (icomp.de) which allowed me to 
  use a commonly used PC floppy drive in my X1000 as if it were an 
  Amiga 3.5 drive. With the 3.5" drive installed the next step was to 
  install SuperDiskImage by Ian Gledhill over at his website
  (http://www.retroreview.com/iang/Catweasel/). Using SuperDiskImage
  is quite straight forward as follows:

  To create an ADF file from a real 3.5" floppy-

  1- Insert disk into 3.5" drive 
  2- Select which drive you want to use (Unit 0 or Unit1)
  3- Click the 'Read Disk' button at top of screen
  4- The blocks at mid screen will turn from black to green after being 
     successfully read.  Note: If a block cannot be successfully read it 
     will appear red.
  5- Once all blocks have been read remove the master disk from drive
     and save the new ADF file by typing the name of the disk into the
     'Image' requester (don't forget to add the '.adf' at the end of the 
     file name) and choose the drive/ partition/ folder to save to.

  To copy an ADF file to a real 3.5" floppy-

  1- Follow items 1 & 2 as above.
  2- Use the file requester to select the file from your hard 
     drive/removable media etc.
  3- Click the 'Write Disk' button at top of screen
  4- The image file selected will be copied track by track to the selected 
     disk.

  If you have some copy protected disks you want to backup you need to do
  the following:

  1- Open a text editor to edit DEVS:NSDPatch.cfg
  2- Add the following lines:

  DEVICE trackdisk.device UNIT 0 MAPTODEVICE catweasel.device MAPTOUNIT 0 MACHINE=machinetype
  DEVICE trackdisk.device UNIT 1 MAPTODEVICE catweasel.device MAPTOUNIT 1 MACHINE=machinetype

  3- Install NSDPatch from aminet (if you haven't done so already)
  4- Copy your SYS:Storage/DOSDrivers/TD0 to SYS:Storage/DOSDrivers/DF0 
  5- Reboot

  If you are into using emulators on your AmigaOS4 system the Catweasel 
  allows you to use your original Commodore 64/128, MS-DOS, ATARI, Texas 
  Instruments, Apple Macintosh, Acorn BBC, Sinclair Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, 
  Tatung Einstein and Triumph-Adler Alphatronic disks! Of course you still 
  need working drives from each system.

  Many thanks to Individual Computers for creating the catweasel cards and to 
  Ian Gledhill for creating SuperDiskImage.

  Cheers,

 	    @{b}LightWave 101 - Part 5@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================
  
  @{b}What Are LW-config & MOD-config?@{ub}
  Welcome to the fifth installment in the LightWave 101 series, for this
  issue we will be looking at the two config files: LW-config (LightWave)
  and MOD-config (Modeler), both files can be found in the Toaster/3D
  directory.  The tutorial will be split into two parts, this part we will
  concentrate on the LW-config file and next time on the MOD-config file.
 
  If you remember back to the first installment in this series we looked 
  at getting your assigns setup so LightWave would load correctly and 
  allow you to access to the surfaces, objects, scenes etc. without 
  causing issues.  

  This is tutorial will go beyond setting up your assigns.  When you load 
  LightWave and open a file requster you may have noticed that the choice 
  of drives at the top may not be the same naming convention as your 
  drives, for example LightWwave's the default device names are:

		Parent | DF0 | HD0 | HD1 | RAM 

  In my instance the drives are not named HD0 and HD1, they are DH0 and 
  DH1.  As such if I click on the HD0 an error requestor will pop up, 
  well this can be fixed by editing the LW-config and MOD-config files.

  @{b}LightWave Config file@{ub}
  Let's have a look at the LW-Config file first, below is a listing of my
  config file and I will show you what I need to fix.

  LWCO
  0
  -The two lines above are file identifiers and should not be changed.

  FileReqPreset1 DF0 DF0:
  FileReqPreset2 HD0 HD0:
  FileReqPreset3 HD1 HD1:
  FileReqPreset4 RAM RAM:
  -The FileReqPreset refers to the four buttons that can be seen at the
   top of all LightWave requesters.  In this instance they are pointing
   to the wrong drives, so I need to change them to DH0 DH0: and DH1 DH1:

  ScenesDirectory 3D:Scenes
  ObjectsDirectory 3D:Objects
  HierarchiesDirectory 3D:Scenes
  SurfacesDirectory 3D:Surfaces
  ImagesDirectory 3D:Images
  OutputDirectory 3D:Images
  FramestoresDirectory 3D:Images
  MotionsDirectory 3D:Motions
  EnvelopesDirectory 3D:Envelopes
  PreviewsDirectory 3D:Previews
  -The 10 lines above tell LightWave where to look when you click on
   Scene, Objects, Surfaces, Images, Motions, Envelopes and Previews.
   Currently they are pointing to 'fake logical volume' called 3D:, this
   was created in the 'user-startup' file.  The basic install of LightWave
   however will be written as such:

   	ScenesDirectory DH1:Toaster/3D/Scenes
	ObjectsDirectory DH1:Toaster/3D/Objects
	HierarchiesDirectory DH1:Toaster/3D/Scenes
	SurfacesDirectory DH1:Toaster/3D/Surfaces
	ImagesDirectory DH1:Toaster/3D/Images
	OutputDirectory DH1:Toaster/3D/Images
	FramestoresDirectory DH1:Toaster/3D/Images
	MotionsDirectory DH1:Toaster/3D/Motions
	EnvelopesDirectory DH1:Toaster/3D/Envelopes
	PreviewsDirectory DH1:Toaster/3D/Previews 

  StatusFilename (none)
  -Back when we did not have powerful computers and render farms were 
   common this was an option used for render farm software.

  DefaultTension 0.000000
  -Changing this can cause any generated keyframe to have tension value
   set to this number (-1 to 1), useful if you do a lot of logo work.

  DefaultSegmentMemory 2200000
  -(Camera panel) This number is used to how much segement memory 
   LightWave will use when rendering images.  It is set quite low due to
   Amigas not having much memory back in the day but with most Amigas 
   having at least 64mb or more you can set this to a higher number.

  DefaultZoomFactor 3.200000
  -Default setting for camera lens when a new scene is started, the 
   default creates a 24mm lens.

  DefaultOverlay 0
  -This interestingly is a feature that was requested by the seaQuest
   animators, the value will determine if LightWave's Data Overlay option 
   will be on (1) or off (0) by default.  If the setting is on, you will 
   be asked if you want the scene name put into the Data Overlay label.

  FrameEndBeep 0
  -Similar to DataOverlay, 0 will be the default Frame End Beep (scene
   panel) off whenver you start LightWave and 1 will default it on.

  RenderDisplayDevice 0
  -Each time you exit LightWave the current settings will be written.
   Essentially it determines what the Render Display will be set to the
   next time you run LightWave.  The options are: None (0), Toaster (1)
   6-bit HAM (2), 8-bit HAM (3) and Picasso II (4).  

  RecordSetup1 (none)
  RecordSetup2 (none)
  RecordCommand (none)
  RecordDelay 0.000000
  FirstFrameDelay 0.000000
  -Upon exiting LightWave the five lines above are written, they refer to
   text entered for Record Setup 1, Record Setup 2, Record Command, Frame
   Record Delay and Extra First Delay.  These are useful when recording by
   single frame to video device.

  DefaultLayoutGrid 4
  -This is not written by LightWave but it sets the default settings for
   Layout Grid, the options being Off (0) to 16x16 (8).

  AutoKeyAdjust 0
  -Affecting the Auto Key Adjust button in the Options Panel, 0 is the 
   button is off and 1 means the button is turned on.  When you modify 
   anything on a keyframe it will automatically create a new keyframe.
   Great for creating a still image but can wreck havok if you are doing
   an animation.

  ExpertMode 0
  -A redundant feature, however when it was turned off (0) you would be
   warned each time you selected a raytracing button, telling you that it
   would take a long time to render.

  As you can see the LW-config file offers a lot of customisation, 
  allowing you to setup LightWave how you want it.  Next time we will
  look at the MOD-config file and see how we can customise the Modeler.

============================================================================

  @{b}Stencils Galore!@{ub}
  Hello and welcome back to another installment of the Brilliance 101
  tutorial series, this issue we will be looking at using the Stencil
  tool in Brilliance.  First let's answer the question, 'Why would you
  want to use a stencil in Brilliance?', well Stencils provide an easy
  way to mask off designated areas of your workspace or screen to prevent
  them from being painted over.  Sounds pretty neat right?  Before we
  start please make sure you are in the HAM version of Brilliance, the
  creation of a stencil mask differs slightly from the Register mode so
  we will start with the HAM version of Brilliance for this tutorial.

  Go to the Gradient menu and choose gradient 2, we choose this one as it
  has a large colour pallete and will help in highlightin Variance.  Set
  Spread to 10 or higher, select Filled Rectangle tool and then choose
  Hightlight fromthe Draw Modes menu and drag out a large rectangle on
  your work screen.  It is not important but you need to set the 
  highlight position, anywhere is fine but for this tutorial we just put
  it in the middle of the box.

  Next bring up the Stencil menu remembering to right mouse click on the
  Stencil tool.  We won't need any other tools at the moment so you 
  close the rest of the tools.  Now that you are in the Stencil tool 
  click on the Select button, you will notice the pointer will turn into
  an eyedropper.  From here find the red area of the box that you drew
  out, click on the reddest part.  Now that you have finished that part
  check the Variance settings are all set to 10.  The manual explains
  Varience best so I will use it's explanation:

  "Variance sets the acceptable range of colours, on either side of the 
  selected colour, that will be incorporated into the mask."

  The Variance settings refer to the Hue, Sauration and Value and we 
  have set them at 10% which is pretty tight range, have a play around
  with the settings later on to see the different Varience settings
  will have on yor Stencil.

  For now let's do a quick test, click on Draw Modes and double check
  that 'Color' is selected.  Select black from the pallete and choosem 
  the Filled Rectangle tool again, draw out a black box completely 
  covering the gradient box.  You will see right away that only the red
  part of the box shows up, congratulations you have done your first 
  Stencil Mask in Brilliance.

  @{b}Next Step@{ub}
  If you haven't done so yet, press U on the keyboard or click on UNDO
  to remove the black box covering your gradient box.  Go back to the 
  Stencil Tool box and set the 'Variance' to 20, click on 'Select' and
  choose the same red colour again.  Click on 'Colors' in the 'Stencil
  Mask' tool, then draw the black box over your gradient box again, 
  you will notice that there are more colours now showing.  The Variance
  settings are much more useful when using the HAM version of Brilliance
  due to more colours being available.

  So far we have used the Stencil in Replace mode, which means that we 
  have been creating a new stencil each time.  If you have a quick 
  look at the Stencil tool you will see there are three options:

	Replace
	Add
	Subtract

  It is possible to use the Add mode to include area of different hues
  or the Replace mode to remove colours from the stencil mask.  But to
  move on, press U or click on UNDO again and let's try one more trick
  with the Stencil tool for this part.  Once you are back in the Stencil
  toolbar click on 'Invert', drag another black box and you will see this
  time only the red colour is removed with the other colours remaing.

  One thing to note is that because we are working in HAM mode the 
  stencil works with a much wider range of colours instead of a single
  colour, as such the active stencil colours are not shown.  In the
  register version of Brilliance the stencil colours are shown with an
  oval.

  Undo the black box again and delete the stencil mask by clicking on
  'Delete' in the Stencil menu.  Now clukc on 'Lasso', locate the area
  that contains the colours you want to isolate, draw a line around 
  them.  To see which colours became part ofthe mask, draw a black box
  over the gradient.

  So far we have looked at how to create a stencil mask from the colours
  that are already on the screen.  However Brilliance also allows you to
  easily draw the stencil mask onto the screen.  Let's take a look at
  that next.

  @{b}Drawing a Stencil@{ub}
  First you will need to delete your stencil, like before.  After you 
  have done that right mouse click on the 'Draw Mode' tool to bring it
  up and click on 'Stencil'.  Choose a filled draw such as a 'Filled
  Rectangle' or 'Filled Shape', draw any shape, maybe your name if it
  is not too long.  Remember if you want to remove a part of your 
  stencil you can do this by holding down the right mouse button and 
  drawing your desired shape.  Once you have drawn your stencil, choose
  'Color' in the 'Draw Mode' tool and once again select the colour black
  and draw a box over your entire gradient.  This time you should see
  only your stencil appear filled with the gradient.  Very easy isn't it?

  Thank you for having joined me on this Brilliance tutorial, good luck
  with your artwork and if you have some finished pieces please send them
  into the Amiga Art Contest 2022, you can find more at:

/**************************************************************************/

                Stems as mock data structures in REXX
             ============================================
                  An experimental "Tutorial as Code"
               (c) 2021 @{"Carl Svensson" link carlsvensson} | www.datagubbe.se
           Tested in ARexx 1.15, Regina REXX 3.6, BRexx 2.1.9

 The REXX language was invented at IBM by Mike Cowlishaw and has since
 been ported from IBM's mainframes to many various platforms, including DOS
 and OS/2. In 1987 it was ported to the Amiga range of computers (as ARexx)
 by William S. Hawes. Today, REXX is available on a multitude of platforms
 thanks to the portable interpreters Regina and BRexx.

 REXX itself has no particular data structures as supplied in modern
 scripting languages such as JavaScript and Python. It provides variables
 and a single stack, but by using what could be described as "syntactic
 sugar" for manipulating the internal symbol table, it enables something
 called stems and compound variables.

 The aim of this tutorial is not to introduce the basics of the REXX
 language, but rather to explain a few concepts that are, AFAIK, unique to
 the REXX family of languages.

 Even though the tutorial has a stupendously pretentious name, the
 hope is that it will be instructive enough to explain how combining
 stems, subroutines and evaluation of strings as code can substitute the
 need for many other language constructs that are not immediately available
 in REXX.

============================================================================
       @{b}Floppy Disks and You@{ub} - by: @{"Ivan Sorensen" link ivansorensen}
============================================================================

  @{b}Floppy disks and you@{ub}
  To get anything out of a computer you of course need to software into it
  first and the default way of doing this has always been the floppy disk: 
  Every Amiga comes with one and when Commodore was around it was the way 
  software was distributed, even if you intended to run it off a hard 
  drive.

  For a while, it seemed like floppies were becoming obsolete: CD ROM 
  became the way for magazines to distribute huge collections of software 
  and the internet allowed things to be downloaded directly on to your 
  machine. With the rise of WHDLoad, you could even forego floppy disks 
  completely for daily games playing.

  However, in the modern age it seems that the floppy has made a sort of 
  return. A lot of new Amiga games are coming out and while many are 
  intended to just be installed directly, some are distributed in ADF 
  format and while there are ways to mount disk images to RAD, this isnt 
  practical for multiple disk games.

  So after many years of neglecting those old drives, we have to dust them 
  off again and that raises the question of replacing them. I stuck with my 
  old drive for years out of habit, but eventually gave in and got a Gotek 
  floppy drive emulator. There are other versions of these out there, but 
  the Gotek is the one I have experience with.
   
  What it does is plug into the Amiga using the normal floppy cable. You 
  then load disk images on to a USB stick and plug it into the drive. The 
  Amiga then reads the ADF exactly as if it was a real disk.
   
  The USB stick can hold multiple files, allowing you to swap disks by 
  clicking the physical buttons on the front of the drive. You do have to 
  memorize or write down what ADFs you have on the stick, but it is rather 
  convenient to work with. It is also quiet and you donât have to worry 
  about whether a copy protection scheme is going to strangle your disk 
  drive. 

  As far as the Amiga is concerned, it is a genuine disk running off of a 
  genuine drive so compatibility is very high. I am sure that some edge 
  case must exist, but so far it has run everything I have tried to load on 
  it. Do note that since it is accurate in terms of emulation, that also 
  means speed: The game loads in the time it would take it to actually load 
  from disk. If you are used to hard drive games and WHDLoad, it can be a 
  bit of a crude reminder.

  On the physical side of things there are some different configurations 
  you can get. The standard Gotek version seems to be built to fit in a PC 
  style case and will NOT fit smoothly in an Amiga wedge case: You will 
  need to modify your case or trail the cable out the back of the machine 
  and use the drive on its own. I have seen modified Goteks specifically 
  for Amiga usage though. I assume if you have a big box machine, you will 
  be fine.

  Other than the difficulty with the physical case (I eventually resolved 
  to just leave my case slightly open, since I use an external keyboard 
  anyway) installation was simple: Just remove the old drive and plug the 
  cables right into the new one. There is no software needed on the Amiga: 
  As far as the computer is concerned, it really is just a floppy drive. 
  The one I purchased came with Amiga specific firmware already loaded, but 
  these devices are highly configurable. 

  Are there any reasons to retain your original drives? I am hard pressed 
  to think of one other than authenticity and the desire to keep a given 
  machine in original configuration (or if your hobby has a strict only 
  Commodore era hardware philosophy). 
  For the average modern user, the Gotek not only is more reliable (and 
  quiet!) than an old drive, it also makes it much easier to actually USE 
  your machine. As anyone who have bought an Amiga 500 can attest to: Its 
  all fun and games until you realize you have no way to actually get 
  software on to your new machine. The Gotek solves that problem: ¨You can 
  simply download disk images from the internet, put them on a cheap USB 
  stick and be up and running on your real hardware. 

  If you have held off, I highly encourage you to give floppy drive 
  emulators a look. I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how 
  convenient they really are.

============================================================================
	   @{b}Internal FPU on A1200@{ub} - by: @{"Chris Edwards" link chrisedwards} & @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

  @{b}Chris Edwards Presents@{ub}
  If you have one of the Terrible Fire accelerator boards for your Amiga, 
  you already know how great they are.  However there is one thing that is
  not a deal breaker but can be a little bit of an issue for users, and 
  that is the lack of an FPU.  Now before you start shouting at me that the
  majority of Amiga software does not require an FPU and it is a waste of
  time and effort, let me explain a bit more.  For the average user, yes, 
  an FPU is generally not needed; if you play games, write music or do 
  pixel art, then the FPU is simply not an issue.  

  However, if you are a power user and by that I mean a person who does 3D 
  rendering or image processing then an FPU can range from being helpful to 
  essential.  An example are the TF12060 users who want to run LightWave 
  4.0, you have the power of the LC060 but LW4.0 requires an Amiga with an 
  FPU to run, no FPU no LW4.0.

  Sadly there is no space on the board to add an FPU so the ever creative 
  Chris Edwards post peaked my interest.  He has posted a very useful video 
  detailing how to install an FPU directly to the A1200 motherboard 
  allowing you to use your, for example, TF1260 with an onboard FPU.  I 
  contacted Chris and he kindly agreed to let WhatIFF? publish his video in
  text form.  What follows is a rough transcript of his video.

  On the A1200 motherboard there is a blank spot in U0, this is the missing
  FPU slot, you have two options 1) solder the FPU directly to the 
  motherboard or 2) attach a PLCC IC socket to the motherboard.  Chris chose
  option 2.  To start with the sockets are still readily available online, 
  but the FPUs ... not as much as they once were, so you might need to 
  search a bit online.  Once you have your socket and FPU, the first thing
  you will need to do is pop out the wafer in the middle of the socket.  

  @{b}But ... @{ub}
  At this point, Chris mentions that others might object since the A1200 
  motherboard does not have a crystal to control the speed of the FPU.  
  Here he points out that the FPU is on the motherboard as such it is 
  controlled by the onboard EC020 and runs at 14mhz, thus the FPU will 
  run at 14mhz.  Now it is not going to be as fast as your accelerator 
  board but this is not the objective of the task, what we are looking to 
  do is give the A1200 FPU functionality so that it can run software that 
  would otherwise not run without the FPU.

  Before beginning to solder he recommends visiting www.amigapcb.org to 
  help with circuit tracing, you do need to know your motherboard revision 
  though.  His motherboard is a 1D1 the most common board, watching the 
  video it seemed a relatively straightforward task however, if you have 
  not done any soldering beforehand you might want to get someone else 
  with more experience to add the socket.  It took Chris about 30 minutes 
  from start to finish.  He proceeded to do some software checks and 
  incredibly the FPU was recognised alongside the TF1230.  When he tried 
  to run software that requires an FPU there were no issues, the TF1230 
  was used as the main CPU and the onboard FPU was recognised allowing 
  FPU-specific software to run.  His video can be found here:

			https://youtu.be/pUtf2D9IAco

  Overall it is a very interesting video and something that if I had more 
  experience with soldering would try.  Chris does recommend doing some 
  practice soldering on old hardware but compared to some of the other 
  soldering I have seen, this one is not too difficult looking.  As it 
  stands I will still be asking my local Amiga hardware guy to add the 
  socket for me, I have not had much luck with soldering in the past and
  do not want to damage my A1200.  It is good to know that this is 
  possible and relatively easy and cheap, if you try this yourself let us
  know how you got along and tell us what you were using the FPU for.

     @{b}Little Things That Made The Amiga Great - by: @{"Carl Svensson" link carlsvensson}
============================================================================

  @{b}Introduction@{ub}
  To most people, the Amiga is probably synonymous with the Amiga 500 and
  that machine was, above all, a video game: something into which you 
  plonked 3.5" floppy disks that transported you to strange, wonderful 
  worlds and hours of fun. To this group, the gamers, the operating 
  system wasn't important. They probably booted Workbench 1.3 only once, 
  took a good look at the garish blue and orange interface, and decided 
  that enough was enough, before going back to blasting enemies in 
  Silkworm.

  And why not? The machine was great for games. There are tons of great 
  texts about the groundbreaking audio and video capabilities of the 
  Amiga.

  This text is not one of those.

  This text is about the later versions of AmigaOS produced by Commodore,
  from 2.0 to 3.1. While these newer versions (with majors released in 
  1990 and 1992, respectively) certainly carried the Amiga heritage with 
  pride and were - mostly - backwards compatible, the advent of AmigaOS 
  2.0 marked a paradigm shift. The shift is best symbolized by the fact 
  that AmigaBASIC - the ubiquitous and mandatory language of any 
  self-respecting eighties home computer - was ditched and replaced by 
  ARexx, a professional scripting language without any kind of graphics 
  or sound features whatsoever.

  This paradigm shift is also why so many of us who had the good fortune 
  to come across those versions clung to the Amiga so desperately. A lot 
  of us stuck with it well into the late nineties, years after 
  Commodore's demise. And we were fierce: if you think Apple fanboys are 
  annoying today, be very happy you didn't meet an Amiga zealot in 1995. 
  Things got personal quickly. It was downright ugly.

  I still think there were some grounds for our fanaticism, though.

  In a time when home PC:s were single tasking DOS boxes with 8-character 
  file names and Ataris and Macs were single tasking GUI boxes, hampering 
  any hacker with their glaring lack of a CLI, the Amiga was a champion 
  of both worlds: It combined the CLI and GUI, leveraging both their 
  strengths. But there was more to it than that, something that's hard to 
  convey in so many words.

  Many a time have I come across exasperated Amiga users who, on some 
  online forum, try to explain the greatness of the Amiga's operating 
  system in a few short sentences. It often, quite understandably, boils 
  down to something akin to "It's like UNIX", which I always think is 
  unfair to both of the systems.

  Sure, it was an early multitasking system with a capable command line. 
  At the same time, it was also a mature and coherent desktop environment 
  with levels of user-friendliness much more like today's MacOS X than 
  any traditional UNIX. But, contrary to today's MacOS, it never 
  mollycoddled the end user. It opened the machine up, rather than 
  closing certain parts off.

  Unlike UNIX, AmigaOS is a system designed for home computer use, 
  lacking a lot of what makes UNIX so popular: memory protection, 
  multi-user support, source code portability and built-in networking 
  support.

  They're very much alike in one aspect, though. Like UNIX, the Amiga's 
  operating system is a collection of a lot of little strokes of genius 
  that come together to make it bigger than the sum of its parts.

  I invite you to explore this ingenuity with me. But first, let's get 
  the terminology sorted.

  @{b}Jargon buster@{ub}
  The Amiga's operating system has been called a lot of things by a lot 
  of people because it consists of many components that different types 
  of users interacted more or less with. Let me try to clear things up 
  a bit:

  @{b}AmigaOS@{ub}
  Commodore didn't call the operating system as a whole "AmigaOS" until 
  the release of version 3.1 in 1994, the year they went defunct. And 
  even then, it was mostly printed on the box it came in - nothing in the
  OS calls itself AmigaOS. It's still a useful umbrella term for all of 
  the components below.

  @{b}Kickstart@{ub}
  This is basically the firmware of the Amiga, residing in the ROM chip.
  On version 2.0 and up, the ROM chip was 512 kB large and contained not
  only code for self-tests and bootstrapping but also quite sizable 
  portions of the other parts of AmigaOS.

  @{b}AmigaDOS@{ub}
  This is, roughly speaking, the command line interface, device drivers, 
  file system management and so on. It was originally based on TRIPOS, a 
  heritage that still shows to this day. (There are newer versions of 
  AmigaOS than 3.1, but this text will only cover the ones released by 
  Commodore.)

  @{b}Intuition@{ub}
  Best likened to a modern desktop compositor, Intuition handles screen 
  updates and manages windows. The custom sound and video chips in the 
  Amiga had mostly female names (Paula, Denise and later Alice), so I 
  suppose Intuition is a fitting name for an abstraction layer that lets 
  the OS interface with them.

  @{b}Workbench@{ub}
  This is often used interchangeably with "AmigaOS" but it's really the 
  name of just the desktop environment - which is a workbench, not a 
  desktop: Programs are called tools, folders a called drawers and 
  data files are called projects.

  @{b}Other terminology@{ub}

  @{b}Requesters@{ub}
  Not really a major part of the OS per se, a requester is the Amiga's 
  name for a dialog box. A "file requester" is a file selection dialog, 
  for example. I still often use this term to describe any dialog on 
  any platform, much to the confusion of friends and colleagues. Old 
  habits die hard.

  @{b}Devices@{ub}
  Devices, much like in UNIX, usually represent peripherals attached to 
  the computer, such as storage media, printers, etc. The Amiga has a 
  number of built-in devices that are automatically mounted, for example 
  the internal floppy drive, DF0: and the serial and parallel ports, 
  SER: and PAR: respectively. Other common devices are DF1:, the first 
  external floppy drive, DH0:, the common device name given to the 
  bootable hard drive partition, and CON:, the text console. There are 
  also devices that can't be mounted but only be accessed using 
  programming languages, such as timer.device which is used to 
  interface with hardware clocks.

  @{b}Volumes@{ub}
  Mounted devices (such as DF0, DF1, DH0) can contain a volume. In the 
  case of DH0:, a bootable hard drive partition, the volume is fixed and 
  is represented by the name of the partition, such as System: or Boot:. 
  If you insert the Deluxe Paint program disk into the internal floppy 
  drive, the current volume in device DF0: will be DPaint:.

  @{b}The RAM Disk@{ub}
  The Amiga always has a RAM disk ready for use and the device name is 
  always RAM:. No mounting, no third party software - it just sits there, 
  waiting. That's clever in its own right, but the really ingenious part 
  about it is that it's dynamically allocated. That means the size of the 
  RAM disk corresponds to the amount of free memory currently available 
  on the system, and that it never takes up more memory than is needed to 
  accommodate the files currently stored on it.

  A RAM disk might sound esoteric today, but in the days of slow 
  mechanical hard drives and floppy disks, it was a godsend for unpacking 
  archives, running test compiles and storing temporary working 
  documents.

  The downside is that every time you reboot your computer, all the 
  contents of the RAM disk are lost. Which brings us to...

  @{b}The RAD Disk@{ub}
  RAD, which (somehow) stands for Recoverable Ram Disk, is another 
  testament to the flexibility and ingenuity of AmigaOS. The RAD disk is 
  a fixed size RAM disk that can not only survive reboots but also 
  itself be booted from. It can be used as a small but extremely fast 
  mini hard drive, or for extracting disk images to, for checking out 
  their contents.

  @{b}Proportional scroll bars@{ub}
  A proportional scroll bar is a scroll bar that grows and shrinks to 
  reflect the size of the scrollable content it represents:

  Highlighting a feature like this might seem like a silly point to 
  make, because today all scroll bars are proportional. Not so in the 
  bad old days: Microsoft didn't implement them until Windows 95 and 
  Apple, as far as I know, didn't make the move until MacOS 9 in 1999. 
  In a time when computer mice had no scroll wheels, this was a nifty 
  feature indeed.

  @{b}The Text Editors@{ub}
  AmigaOS shipped with three different text editors: Ed, Edit and 
  MEmacs. The latter is a port of, you guessed it, Micro Emacs, and 
  will of course appeal to Emacs fans. The other two are sort of 
  curiously named: Edit is a line editor mostly resembling ed on 
  UNIX. The Amiga's Ed, on the other hand, is a full screen editor 
  with both mouse support and an extensive command language. Amiga Ed is 
  probably best likened with vi.

  All three of them are capable and powerful editors. Both MEmacs and Ed 
  make use of the Amiga's drop down GUI menus and feature support for 
  macros and extensive configuration.

  Ed's command mode is, as mentioned earlier, somewhat reminiscent of vi. 
  Consider the following examples:

  Change the next three occurrences of "data" to "gubbe":
  3 E/data/gubbe/

  Move to top of file, repeat (RP) replace of "data" with "gubbe" until 
  end of file:
  T; RP E/data/gubbe/

  Move to top of file, find all occurrences of "gubbe" and insert three 
  blank lines after every occurrence, repeat until end of file:
  T; RP (F /gubbe/; 3A//)

  Ed also has something called an ARexx port, which completely 
  intentionally leads us to...

  @{b}ARexx@{ub}
  ARexx is an improved and Amiga-ized version of IBM's REXX language. 
  It's a capable (albeit somewhat dated, these days) general-purpose 
  scripting language with excellent functions for easy string parsing.

  Through an interprocess communication interface, it can also act as 
  "glue" between various programs with so-called ARexx ports. For 
  example, if both your text editor and Desktop Publishing package 
  have ARexx ports, you can write a script for automatically inserting 
  the text you've just written in the editor into the desktop 
  publishing program by interfacing with them both using ARexx.

  Ed, the editor described above, exposes its command language through 
  its ARexx port, allowing users to create highly advanced text 
  processing scripts.

  @{b}No CD@{ub}
  While AmigaDOS does have a CD command, it's usually not needed. Any 
  command that evaluates to a valid path will automatically change the 
  current working directory to that path:

  1.System:> Work:Code/ARexx/WebServer
  1.Work:Code/ARexx/WebServer> _

  @{b}File Systems@{ub}
  OFS (Old File System) and FFS (Fast File System) are the Amiga's 
  native file systems. Thanks to the modular and ingenious nature of the 
  OS, the Amiga can, much like UNIX, handle an arbitrary amount of file 
  systems. Version 3.0 of the OS shipped with CrossDOS, a utility to 
  mount MS-DOS FAT volumes - but a lot of others have popped up as well, 
  from third-party native replacements for FFS to ports of for example 
  EXT2.

  @{b}Assigns@{ub}
  An assign is a kind of fake logical volume that can point to any path. 
  It's great for deep directory structures. Say you've got a current 
  programming project going in Work:Code/ARexx/WebServer. That's quite a 
  handful to type often. By creating an assign, 
  ASSIGN wserv: Work:Code/ARexx/WebServer, you can now access files and 
  CD to your project directory by referring to wserv: instead.

  An assign can also span several physical volumes. The Amiga's standard 
  assign where it looks for dynamic libraries is LIBS:, pointing at the 
  Libraries directory of the current boot volume. But what if you're 
  writing a new such library and don't want to litter your system 
  directory with your development versions of it while testing?

  Not to worry, you can ADD to any assign:

  1.System:> Assign LIBS: Work:Code/C/HTMLParseLibrary ADD

  AmigaOS will now look for dynamic library files in both paths!

  @{b}Libraries@{ub}
  Much like libraries in UNIX, this is a way of sharing common functions 
  between different programs. Amiga libraries are always dynamically 
  linked and yet, for some reason, there never seems to be any problems 
  with backwards compatibility. For an end user, things just generally 
  work.

  Commodore shipped AmigaOS with libraries for everything from 
  mathematical functions to something called ASL, used for creating file 
  and font requesters.

  @{b}ASL@{ub}
  The simplest way for a programmer to ask the user to pick a file or a 
  font is through the ASL library. Using a standardized API, a requester 
  (dialog) for saving or loading a document can be presented to the user. 
  The dialogs have functions for pattern matching and keyboard 
  navigation.

  Sadly, it doesn't stand for "Age, Sex, Location" but rather 
  "Amiga Standard Library."

  @{b}Datatypes@{ub}
  Datatypes are, in a sense, a bit like dynamic libraries for file 
  formats. Instead of relying solely on the capabilities of, say, a 
  graphics program to implement loaders for every conceivable file format
  if it supports Datatypes, it can load images of any format for which a 
  Datatype is installed in the system.

  This is a great way of future-proofing software, ensuring that even 
  older programs can load and display newer image formats. When the PNG 
  format was created in 1996, many Amiga programs made years earlier 
  could load those images through the use of a third-party PNG datatype 
  released as freeware.

  @{b}ReadArgs@{ub}
  While AmigaOS doesn't have online documentation like UNIX man pages, 
  it does have a standardized way for CLI programs to read arguments. 
  This is facilitated by the ReadArgs function, designed to help 
  programmers implement this way of reading arguments.

  The ? (question mark) argument always produces a list of a command's 
  arguments and their kind, and then awaits user input of said 
  arguments:

  1.System:> Delete ?
  FILE/M/A,ALL/S,QUIET/S,FORCE/S: _

  So what does this mean? It means that FILE can be multiple strings (/M) 
  and that it's a required argument (/A); ALL, QUIET and FORCE, 
  meanwhile, are boolean flags, or switches (/S).

  There are also patterns for keywords (/K), numbers (/N), and a handful 
  more. Once you get the hang of it, it's a very helpful reference system 
  for refreshing your memory, and the argument names tend to have 
  curiously sensible names.

  ReadArgs is refreshingly easy to implement in shell scripts, ensuring 
  conformity to standards even for the simplest of tasks.

  @{b}AmigaGuide@{ub}
  AmigaGuide is an early hypertext format, originally used by Commodore 
  for their official developer documentation, but delivered as a standard 
  component of AmigaOS 3.0 and up. It's simple compared to modern HTML: 
  it can't display inline images or play background sounds, but you can 
  create links to arbitrary files that are then displayed separately.

  It quickly became popular and before long, most freeware, shareware and 
  public domain programs came with AmigaGuide documentation.

  @{b}Installer@{ub}
  In the beginning, hard drive installation of programs was made using 
  shell scripts. Seeing the havoc wreaked by such scripts, Commodore 
  eventually created a standardized software installer. It's a brilliant 
  little tool for selecting installation paths, creating directories, 
  comparing file versions, copying files and modifying startup scripts.

  Pretty much all developers adopted this right away, including 
  PD/Freeware authors, much to the enjoyment of end-users. To this day, 
  installers for my crappy Amiga software remain the only really 
  meaningful thing I've coded in a purely functional language: 
  Installer scripts are written entirely in LISP.

  Because of the powerful nature of having a LISP dialect and easy 
  access to a subset of the Amiga's GUI widgets, the Installer has also 
  been used to create simple adventure games.

  @{b}Standardized File Structure@{ub}
  Every Amiga installation looks basically the same, especially where it 
  really matters. We've already covered shared libraries and their 
  residence in LIBS:. The same pattern is used for the rest of the system 
  files: Device drivers are always in DEVS:, file system drivers and 
  other low-level stuff in L:, AmigaDOS commands belong in C:, shell 
  scripts (including the bootup scripts, Startup-Sequence and 
  User-Startup) live in S:, typefaces are always in FONTS:, and so on.

  @{b}Resident programs@{ub}
  Some programs, most of them AmigaDOS commands, can be made resident - 
  that is, stored in memory for future use. This is useful to avoid 
  excess disk access when performing certain tasks.

  @{b}RequestChoice@{ub}
  AmigaDOS has a simple command for asking the user a Yes/No question, 
  called Ask. In version 3.0, Commodore introduced the commands 
  RequestChoice, for making a multiple-choice GUI requester and 
  RequestFile, for opening a file requester. A nice example of how 
  integrated the GUI and CLI environments are on AmigaOS.

  @{b}.info Files@{ub}
  A bit like with MacOS X, if you give a disk to an enthusiastic Amiga 
  novice and ask to have a few files copied onto it, you'll probably 
  find it littered with strange files that serve no apparent purpose. 
  They always have the same name as another file, but end with ".info".

  These are the Amiga's icon files, containing not only the actual icon 
  image, but also a bit of metadata. For a data file, that can be what 
  program to open the file with, which means that if you double click a 
  picture created with, say, Deluxe Paint, then Deluxe Paint will be 
  started and then load the picture in question. This is called the 
  file's "default tool".

  The .info files also contained positional information: the desired 
  coordinates of the icon within its parent window. For drawer 
  (directory) icons, it also stored the size and position of the 
  window opened to display their contents.

  Other noteworthy metadata is represented by the Tool Types, which can 
  be described as settings or arguments for a program. For example, such 
  a tool type can be used to control if Deluxe Paint should display the 
  coordinates for the mouse pointer's current position.

  A system with stand-alone icon files might seem odd today, but instead 
  of having centralized icon storage or embedding the icons into the 
  binaries, this method meant that tooltypes, default programs and 
  positional information could easily be transferred between systems. It 
  also gave the users freedom to modify or even draw new program icons or 
  delete them completely if they wanted to save disk space.

  Several beautiful icon sets were released as third-party shareware, 
  most notably Magic Workbench.

  @{b}Closing words@{ub}
  While certainly not a UNIX clone, the Amiga was still a great 
  preparatory platform for tackling other operating systems further on. 
  When I first stumbled across Linux (and other *nixes) in 1995, a lot of 
  stuff instinctively made sense to me. I easily drew parallels to 
  AmigaOS and was already familiar with a lot of the concepts: devices, 
  mounting, task priorities, shell scripts and scripting languages, 
  Emacs and much more. And as much as I enjoy UNIX today, it's when I sit 
  down in front of an Amiga that I truly feel at home and in control.

  I hope this text has given you some insight into what made the Amiga 
  great. There are of course many more things, but these are a few that 
  have stayed with me. Some concepts, like Datatypes, are still unique to 
  the Amiga and would be an interesting and useful addition to an 
  operating system even today.

  And remember - Only Amiga makes it possible!

		@{b}Authenticity, the Amiga and You@{ub} - by: @{"Ivan Sorensen" link ivansorensen}
============================================================================

  @{b}Authenticity, the Amiga and you@{ub}
  Whenever retro-enthusiasts are discussing ways to interact with old 
  software, you inevitably get the discussion about what is authentic: 
  Is emulation authentic? Is a Raspberry Pi in an Amiga case authentic? 
  What about Morph OS or OS4? What about an FPGA system? Surely, an 
  actual Amiga is authentic right?

  Now first and foremost I want to preface this by saying that 
  authenticity ultimately depends on what specific things you value and 
  whether it is important at all is ultimately up to the end user. The 
  Amiga fan base has people who love the hardware and people who love 
  the software and they are not always the same people.
 
  But that doesn't mean we can't stop and take stock of the situation 
  and maybe try to explore the topic a little bit. Maybe we can then all
  get a better understand of each other and even ourselves?

  On the surface it appears to be simple enough: An Amiga 1200 is 
  authentic (because it is the real deal). An FPGA system that reproduces 
  the Amiga 1200 chips is less authentic and a computer running an 
  emulator is the least authentic. Case closed and we can all go home.

  But can we really? 

  Let's take a closer look at our Amiga 1200.
 
  My Amiga today is fairly modest compared to many systems enthusiasts 
  have built: A 1200 with a fast 68030 card and a few other upgrades. 
  Pretty good but a far cry from the maxed out machines people like to 
  set up. How authentic is that system? Well, the case and board is 
  1992 vintage so that's very authentic. The ROMs are 3.1 so they are 
  authentic enough.
 
  But the accelerator card was made in 2010 and is faster than any 68030 
  available at the time. The hard drive is a compact flash card in an IDE
  adapter, the mouse is a PS2 mouse with an adapter, the joystick is 
  brand new, I've attached a PS2 keyboard using a Lyra and the disk drive
  is a Gotek.

  Do any of those change that this is an authentic system? Well, it must 
  right? All of this is equipment that was not available at the time. But
  at the same time, none of it really adds capabilities that were 
  impossible. The Gotek is much more convenient than a real floppy drive, 
  but it still acts like a floppy drive. My brand new joystick is much 
  more precise than the Quickshots I got off ebay but it's still just a 
  joystick with 9 pin connector and so forth.

  If we had to rate it on a scale from 100 (completely authentic) to 0 
  (completely inauthentic) maybe its around 70?

  It certainly feels authentic when I sit and use it but what was my 
  system like at the time? It was an Amiga 1200 with an external floppy 
  drive and that was it.
 
  For comparison I looked up a Mac from 1992 and my accelerator card has 
  6 times as much RAM and a much faster CPU. My relatively humble Amiga 
  today would have been a beast of a computer in 1992. So clearly my 
  Amiga now cannot be authentic to the experience I had as a 12 year old.

  That is leaving aside the software. Now I can click on a game and 
  through the magic of WHDLoad it loads the game into memory and runs the
  same way it would on a cartridge based system. Meanwhile in 1992 I 
  would have been swapping disks and waiting for the grinding of the disk
  drive (while hoping the rumors that copy protection could destroy your 
  drive were false. I never did find out).

  Would sitting in the dark room with a stack of floppies and an old ball
  mouse be more authentic? Yes. Undeniably so. That IS the authentic 
  Amiga experience for me.

  But would I want to again? Well, I did but I also upgraded my system 
  when I was able to in order to get more functionality or more 
  convenience or more capabilities. 

  So I guess my conclusion is that I am happy with 70% authenticity. And 
  I expect I'll be happy at 80% or at 60%. What is your level of 
  authenticity? What did you build your system to do?

  Take a moment to think about it the next time you boot it up.

@node retrocomputermeetup "Retro Computer Meetup Tokyo?"

============================================================================
		 @{b}Retro Computer Meetup Tokyo@{ub} - by @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

  In an attempt to broaden the scope of the magazine we will be starting
  section focusing on local Amiga or retro computer groups/meetups around
  the world.  To start this off we will be looking at the Tokyo Retro 
  Computer Users meet up in Kayabacho, Tokyo.  I had been introduced 
  about this meet up by Edoardo or has he is also known as `kinmami` on 
  EAB.  Last year he had replaced the CAPS and DAC chip on my A1200, 
  making it sing like new again.  A few times he had invited me to attend
  but due to the covid situation I had been hesitant, however now with my
  third vaccine well and done, it was time to venture up to Tokyo.

  I live in Chiba which is about 50 minutes by train to Tokyo station,
  getting to Kayabacho was a short trip of only 47 minutes by rapid train
  on the Keiyo line.  On the train I had my A1200 with me again, ready to
  have the TF1260 firmware updated by Edoardo.  It was quite exciting as
  I had not been out since the covid situation and more so I had not met
  any Amiga users in Japan since I had moved here so I was very much 
  looking forward to meeting similar minded Amiga junkies.

  Upon arriving at Hatchobori station, it was a short walk to the exit
  that would take me to the Co-Edo Co-working Space Kayabacho, according
  to Google maps it should only take 7 minutes.  The map looked very 
  simple but I seem to have any amazing ability to confuse map directions.
  Following the map printout (Yes, I do not have a smartphone and still
  find my way around like it's 2000 again) I ended up on the wrong side 
  of the river, brilliant!  Quickly I backtracked to Hatchobori station 
  and started again, however this time I asked some friendly Tokyoites if
  I was on the right track.  Everyone I asked gave me great directions 
  until I was very close and .... still could not find the place, I
  went to a Lawson convenience store and asked the staff where I could 
  find the Co-Edo building.  He looked at me for long moment, then 
  pointed behind me.  To my surprise there it was behind me, feeling like
  an idiot I apologised and thanked him.

  Finally arriving at the building, it was like most typical Tokyo 
  buildings, thin and tall, the entrance was cramped but effective.  
  The reception was on the 5th floor, when I got there I told them I was
  with Sean, paid my ¥1,100, filled in my details and received my one day
  visitor pass.  From there it was down to the 4th floor to meet the 
  guys for the first time.  Entering the 4th floor, it was refreshingly
  cool thanks to the air-conditioning.  Splitting the room was a
  smoked glass window with the meeting taking place on the other side.
  I cautiously opened the door and the first person I met was Edoardo, 
  I introduced myself and then proceeded to meet the rest of the 
  people there.  This was around 10:30 am and at that time there 
  were not too many people, so it was easy to meet everyone.  Sean is the
  organiser and you can find him walking around taking photos and videos
  asking questions about the various computers that people brought in.

  The room had two main tables and one of them were some very large 
  computers, one being a Casio FP-1100 brought in by Sean.  He kindly
  showed be around the machine and sat me down for game or two.  It
  was a very striking machine that would not look out of place in 
  any of the current electronic stores.  The design was very modern
  looking, aside from the fact that the keyboard cannot be disconnected.
  That it itself would be an issue but the keyboard was almost as big as
  the computer!
  Curt brought in a Basic Master Level 3 computer which was another 
  monster of a computer, unfortunately I never got round to having a play
  on that one.

  The guys there were very friendly and quick to answer any questions
  I had.  If you wanted to try a machine they would you sit down and 
  expliain the machine.

  The atmosphere was very relaxed and friendly, I immediately felt at
  at home there.  After getting introduced to the rest of the guys
  it came time for my TF1260 firmware update, it took a little while 
  longer than expected since Windows had to update, or as Edoardo said
  "It's plug and pray!", luckily the update went without hitch and then
  it was on to my TF1260.  The firmware was fast, pretty much instant.
  From there on the Amiga would just sit doing some tasks to check its 
  stability.

  A little later some more people arrived, first Michelle with a massive
  suitcase, upon opening it up she had a NEC PC-8801MA plus 14" CRT 
  monitor, it must have been quite a journey for her lugging all 35kg of
  that from Yokohama.

  However as being someone who does not have the money or space to
  buy other computers this was a fantastic opportunity to get up close 
  with rare computers and even try the out.  Michelle introduced me to 
  one of the most difficult games I have ever played, Warpman, I think I 
  demonstrated my lack of gaming skills quite well during that time.
  Michelle tried her best to guide me how to play the game but my hands
  and brain seemed to be doing the opposite of what I wanted.

  Shortly after Michelle arrived Robert another newcomer came in lugging
  another huge box, this was going to the highlight of the day for many
  people as when he unwrapped the computer it was a SGI Iris Indigo.  
  Suffice to say many of us had our interest peaked at the sight of that
  rare beast.  The next few hours flew by as we played with the various 
  hardware talked shop, computers and games.  It turned out that Robert 
  was another EAB member and was an Amiga user, bringing the total of 
  Amiga guys to three at the meet up.  Suffice to say talk quickly moved
  to the Amiga, it seems no matter in the world if you have Amiga users 
  they are happy as ducks in water to fritter the hours away talking 
  about the Amiga.

  Sven was originally working on his Z80 mini PC, a very cute looking
  computer, but when Robert unveilved his SGI all thoughts of the Z80 were 
  gone.  As the day passed on more and more people turned up, unfortunately 
  I did not have the chance to talk to all them.  Saburo I am sorry I did 
  not have a chance to chat to, hopefully we can talk properly next time.  

  Overall it was a great day, meeting people interested in old computers
  and the chance to see and touch some incredibly rare computers was 
  great fun.  The fact that the owners there are happy to tell you about
  the computer's history, how to use them and answer any questions you may 
  have, makes it a very welcoming and enjoyable event.  If you are an 
  Amiga user or retro computer collector and want to spend time with 
  similar minded people then I recommend attending an event.  I will be
  attending the next event at the end of August or early September with my
  A1200 for another firmware update to be done and maybe have an FPU socket
  installed onto the motherboard.

  If you live Tokyo or Chiba and are an Amiga user I hope we can see you at
  the next event!

@node edoardo "Edoardo Auteri"
@toc talkingamiga
 
  @{b}Edoardo, thank you for taking the time to answer our questions.@{ub}

  @{b}Can you tell us a little about yourself?@{ub}

  Hello, glad to be here. Thank you for the fantastic opportunity.
  My name is Edoardo Auteri, European, born in Italy in 1977. I moved to
  Asia in 2010 and from 2014 working and living in Tokyo. I am fascinated
  by the eighties of which I keep vivid memories and try to replicate the
  best aspects in everyday life. I am working in the semiconductor 
  industry since 1997.

  @{b}How did you get started with computers?@{ub}

  I have always been interested in electronic games and entertainment. 
  When possible, I would go to arcades to play games in the eighties. In
  1985 a school mate invited me home for Sunday lunch and afternoon 
  study. His father challenged us to play Zaxxon with the Commodore 128 
  he just bought. I was impressed with the isometric view, collisions, 
  and sound effects. Also playing with a paddle was a memorable 
  experience as I just used the arcade joysticks. My first home computer
  was the Commodore 64C given to me by my parents in Christmas 1986. And
  from that moment on I have not stopped interested in hardware.

  @{b}What was your first Amiga experience?@{ub}

  My first model was the Amiga 500 purchased in the summer of 1988. 
  Advertisements in newspapers and television channels were rife in 
  Italy. There was a murmur in classrooms about "a new home computer 
  capable of speaking voices and playing orchestral music". I was using 
  the C64 with satisfaction, yet I was curious. I first tried the A500 at
  friends' and Commodore dealers in late 1987. Japanese consoles, Atari, 
  and Spectrum did not shock me (not yet at least) while I was thrilled 
  by the idea that a new Commodore model could go beyond the potential of 
  the C64.

  @{b}What attracted you to working with Amiga hardware?@{ub}

  The genius in the design of the custom chips and the flexibility of 
  the Amiga structure represent an immense interest in improving, 
  expanding performance. Furthermore, the possibility of managing audio 
  and video with relative ease achieving results comparable (for the 80s
  and 90s) to television studios was astounding. Both on C64 and on Amiga
  I experimented with DIY boards connected to serial, parallel and 
  expansion ports. I wrote high- and low-level language programs. In 
  short, I prepared myself for the future study and work. I would not be 
  in Tokyo, and I would not deal with technology and semiconductors if 
  I had not kept practicing in depth with Commodore Amiga.

  @{b}What kind of work do you do on the Amiga?@{ub}

  Nowadays I delight in repairing all models. From a simple replacement 
  of worn capacitors and logics to the modification/fixing of old 
  original layout boards. Continuing with the design and prototyping of
  new expansion cards, adapters, and accessories that I usually share 
  with the community (EAB, Discord, Hackaday and PCBWay). Sometimes I 
  like to load and run classic games of course.

  @{b}You currently live in Japan, what brought you to Japan?@{ub}

  Japan strongly influenced my Italian childhood. I do not remember 
  anything other than fashions, hobbies, entertainment directly or 
  indirectly imported from Japan. I am not a fanatic of everything made 
  in Japan. However, I appreciate good manners, respect for one's word, 
  lifestyle. These are aspects that Italy has only partially been able 
  to perpetuate. Before Tokyo I lived and worked in Seoul, Shenzhen, 
  Singapore in the semiconductor market.

  @{b}Can you describe the current Amiga scene in Japan?@{ub}

  I know few Commodore Amiga enthusiasts and collectors in Japan. These 
  are not usually gents and ladies experimenting with their machines. 
  Friendly people interested in news. They were even former employees of 
  the Japanese branch of Commodore (they showed photos with Jay Miner). 
  There are also friends from the US, UK and Australia living in Japan 
  and using Amigas. They are running YouTube channels in English and 
  Japanese showing the pixel art, and hardware & software tutorials, for
  example.

  @{b}You are one-half of the Ramixx500 Amiga 500+ Main board replacement 
  project, can you tell us a little behind the idea?@{ub}

  The project author is Giorgio Moscardi, known as Sukkopera. He is based
  in Turin, Italy. All credits to Giorgio and his formidable ability 
  and meticulousness. I validated the project by bench evaluation, 
  finding bugs, and suggesting Giorgio improvements. The purpose of the 
  project, well explained on Hackaday, is to improve the original concept
  to preserve the design and make it usable at reasonable prices. Sordan
  (Ireland) is the online shop that helps supporting the project. Thanks
  to Giorgio for his extraordinary effort.

  @{b}What kind of improvements do you plan to incorporate into the new 
  motherboard?@{ub}

  We have redesigned the power and ground planes. Additionally, we have 
  done a more reasonable selection of the Bill Of Materials list, added
  video sync buffer, jumpers to switch among internal/external FDD, HDD 
  led activity circuit, ESD protections, etc. We have worked out a new 
  Video Hybrid, also known as VIDIOT, able to output 15KHz colorful 
  composite and S-VIDEO signals for the A500 and A2000, A3000.

  @{b}You are working on a new motherboard however the board will need 
  original chips, do you think it will be possible to re-create all the 
  custom chips allowing the Amigas to live on for longer in physical form?@{ub}

  In theory anything can be reprogrammed using a proper FPGA. In fact, 
  there are tentative of making a brand-new FATTER AGNUS, DENISE, etc. 
  For example, BUSTER for A2000 is implemented with a FPGA and available 
  to users. The 680xx microprocessor itself is entirely reinvented with 
  FPGA and will be available soon. Dave Haynie is studying an improved 
  version of SUPER BUSTER for the A3000 and A4000. Today the market does 
  suffer the shortage then projects slowed down or stopped. We will see 
  how things will go after 2025, I suppose.

  @{b}What Amigas do you own? If you have any other types of computers please
  feel free to mention them.@{ub}

  Various models of A500/+, A600, A1000 (and Phoenix), A2000, A1200, 
  A3000, A4000 (desktop), CD32, CDTV. In addition to C16, Plus4, C64,
  C128, Sony/Toshiba/Casio MSX, MSX2+, Sharp X68000XVI, Atari 800XL, 
  Atari 1040 STE and vintage consoles from Nintendo, Panasonic, and 
  Sega. I miss Amiga tower versions, but I own all motherboard/hardware
  desktop revisions, including SAM460ex.

  @{b}What is your main Amiga setup?@{ub}

  A1200 with TF1260 accelerator, kickstart 3.2, Flash Floppy drive and 
  CF HDD. Definitely 32bit AGA based.

  @{b}What would your dream Amiga be?@{ub}

  It is nice to see that over the past twelve months they have released 
  (numerically) more quality games and enhanced versions of classics of 
  Amiga than new Sony PS5 releases. There is excitement and there are 
  innate talents working from behind the scenes. I would like to play 
  the Street Fighter II Champion Edition conversion built out of 
  Scorpion Engine actually. I have no dreams of new hardware/accessories.

  Stakeholders need new software applications and tools. I hope that the
  global Commodore / Amiga community will become more supportive, 
  meritocratic, open-minded, and put aside feelings of hatred and 
  greediness.

  @{b}Thank you for your time Edoardo, do you have any final words or 
  anything you would like to mention?@{ub}

  I appreciate the kind interest and wishing everyone the best possible.
  Please feel free to contact me further on SNS and discussion forums.

@node pawel "Pawel Nowak Interview"
@toc talkingamiga

  @{b}Pawel Nowak, thank you for taking the time to answer our questions.@{ub}
 
  @{b}Can you tell us a little about yourself?@{ub}

  I'm Pawel, I live in Poland, specifically in Krakow. Professionally 
  deals with programming. I also have my own small printing company which
  I also use in the retro world - I publish games in large boxes, CDs or 
  even cassettes. I'm 39 so I'm still very young :-) I have a wonderful 
  wife and two children. I don't have as much time for my hobby as I used
  to, but I try to support the Amiga market as much as I can. I am also a
  collector of old computer junk.

  @{b}How did you get started with computers?@{ub}

  My first computer (when I was 7) was the Atari XE. It is thanks to him 
  that I learned what it means to program. After about two years, I was 
  able to exchange it for the Amige 500, which was a total novelty for 
  me. I had no idea there was such a thing as a computer mouse. What the
  Amiga offered exceeded all expectations. I stuck to my A500 for a long
  time, everyone around them had a great A1200 with 030 and 040, and I 
  was still faithful to my A500. Finally my friends convinced me and I 
  bought a used A1200. I could do anything on it. After a while I got 
  Blizzard PPC. This adventure continued for a few more years until my 
  card broke. for about 10 years I lost my interest in Amiga. After this 
  time, I started collecting retro gear, including going back to the 
  amiga and starting coding again.

  
  @{b}What was your first Amiga experience?@{ub}

  After replacing Atari with Amige in 1992, I was still a kid, but I 
  already had some knowledge of how to use a computer efficiently and 
  could deepen it further. I was interested in games on the average, 
  one day we bought VBS, and this opened access to huge collections of 
  software, disk magazines and other productions from the demoscene. 
  At that time, in Poland, no one was concerned about copyright. On 
  the one hand, it is bad because it was hard for people to give up 
  piracy later, and on the other hand, it made development possible. 
  I started to get to know new contacts, with whom I exchanged letters, 
  until I got to the right people and entered the scene as a swapper, 
  I started going to an Amiga party and got into it all totally. In 
  the last days of my swapper life I belonged to groups such as 
  Appendix, Nah-Kolor or Mawi.

  @{b}What attracted you to working with Amiga hardware?@{ub}

  The Motorola 68k is the most attractive software processor I know. You
  don't need a lot of knowledge to quickly learn its secrets and start 
  writing your own code. Amiga hardware is a great fun environment for 
  both beginners and advanced players. You can do everything your way 
  and enjoy the final result even if the requirements are greater than 
  the goal of the A500 Amiga. Amiga and assembler is the best 
  combination.

  @{b}What kind of work do you do on the Amiga?@{ub}

  It's quite simple in my case - 90% of the time I sit on IMP (a lot is 
  happening on our Polish channel), 10% watch demos. Sometimes I bend 
  these proportions and check new programs or games.

  @{b}You live in Poland, can you describe the Amiga scene there?@{ub}

  The Amiga scene in Poland has always been large, both in the times of 
  the amiga's glory, when a lot of demoscene productions were created, 
  as well as now, when the demoscene is no longer active, but various 
  types of meetings, just amiga owners, the larger and smaller ones take 
  place all the time in various corners of our country. I have friends a 
  few hundred km away, and it seems to me that I meet them every now and 
  then, and meeting someone after many years is my everyday life. A lot 
  of people come back to using amiga, despite the fact that in our 
  country, probably everyone is as busy as possible :)

  @{b}Infinity Music Player (IMP) was your creation, what other Amiga 
  software did make before IMP?@{ub}

  On aminet.net you can find some of my programs, some have been there for
  over 20 years. From newer stuff, someone may associate me with games 
  that I create in the Project R3D group, such as Tanks Furry, Bridge 
  Strike, Zgr3d or Astro Blox Revisited - all are available for free 
  download on aminet.net or in a physical version (box) on the website 
  www.cdlabel.eu

  @{b}What gave the idea to create IMP?@{ub}

  I was looking for an idea for a network program. In general, I was 
  interested in how to program the internet in amiga. First, I thought 
  about a game that would use it, for example for online play. But such
  a game would take years to develop, so I was still looking for new 
  ideas, and finally it dawned on me that having a show collection of 
  modules, it could be easily used and then the first version of the 
  IMP was created, which worked exclusively in CLI, loaded a random 
  module one by one (it additionally buffered them, to play next one 
  right away). The idea was well received in the community and I 
  immediately started adding more stuff, information about samples, 
  preview of patterns played (still in CLI :)), number of online users, 
  simple chat etc, until it turned out that the GUI version was inevitable.

  @{b}There must have been many hurdles during the project, what were some 
  of the most difficult ones?@{ub}

  The hardest part was bsdsocket.library, which was news to me, and there 
  is not much documentation for the assembler. Something that worked on 
  the winuae wasn't working on a real amiga, then something that worked 
  on miami didn't work elsewhere, something that already worked on every 
  tcp / ip stack suddenly had problems with different drivers - 
  especially atypical NICs for large amigos. Modules player clashed with 
  interrupts, etc. In the end, all the problems were solved - thanks to 
  the people who tested the program (because I do not have access to 
  every possible configuration myself at home)

  @{b}The software has many features already, do you plan to improve or add 
  to the program?@{ub}

  At this stage, there is no greater need for software development, but 
  sometimes you suddenly get an idea and implement it. I don't think too 
  much about it anymore. However, I am developing an additional thing 
  that will soon see the light of day. It is an impbox - an esp32 based 
  device plugged into a parallel port in the amiga. Thanks to it, the 
  imp does not need an Internet connection, the wifi module in the impbox
  is used to communicate with the server, so the strobe configuration on 
  the Amiga side is omitted, more memory remains in the amiga itself. 
  Impbox is equipped with a display with information about logged in 
  users, vumeter. It is still a development issue, but it works quite 
  steadily. the basic cdtv amiga achieved a transfer of around 70kb/s, 
  which beats the plipbox you know at the moment.

  @{b}What Amigas do you own?@{ub}

  Currently I have 36 amiga, and a lot of other computers and consoles. 
  There would be no space to describe it, but when someone visits me, 
  you can always count on a little tour and getting to know my 
  collection. An almost up-to-date list can be found here 
  http://szajb.us

  @{b}What is your main Amiga setup?@{ub}

  I have used many amiga interchangeably. The most common are amiga with
  warp1260, amiga 4000 with 060 and zz9k (with additional sound card), 
  amiga 2000 with tf536 and amiga 500 with aca1233n. I also turn on my 
  cdtv from 010 a lot to test the impa as well. In the second apartment 
  I have a600 with v2 which I use only for imp and testing the impbox.

  @{b}What would your dream Amiga be?@{ub}
 
  I haven't looked at it in such terms for a long time. Amiga with aga 
  and fast 060 is all that is enough for me to demoscene. Older 
  productions can be run on any other. I miss a4k mediator a bit to take
  advantage of the PPC (bigfoot) that lies and waits in the desk drawer,
  and to have access to the rest of the ppc demos. Here, the equipment 
  with morphos comes to the rescue, which fill me up a bit. I can enjoy 
  any amiga with no matter what configuration and I don't need anything 
  else.

  @{b}Thank you for your time Pawel, do you have any final words or anything
  you would like to mention?@{ub}

  Thank you that you are still with the amiga, for me it is a huge chunk 
  of my life and something that shaped me in its own way, I cannot 
  imagine my life without it now. Thank you all for your great support, 
  turning a blind eye to various inconveniences in my productions, for 
  healthy criticism and for the fact that we have something to talk 
  about. 

  Thank you for inviting me to this interview, it's great that such 
  magazines are still coming out in the Amiga media world.

============================================================================
 	    @{b}Ivent's Corner@{ub} - by: @{"Kevin Saunders" link kevinsaunders}
============================================================================

  In recent times I have had more interest in developing for the Amiga 
  Vampire platform.  Over the years I have followed it with great 
  interest.  So far we have 3 games, *Apollo Crown*, *Apollo Blocks* and
  a Tech Demo for *Apollo Menace*. Gunnar and his son Arne are the main 
  coders I work with.   

  We are currently working on *Apollo Space Invaders* and this is a great
  fun game to play and is evolving into something better.

  We have plans on a few new games *Joust* (Arcade conversion), 
  *Arkanoid* clone, *Mutant Monty* remake (Amstrad CPC conversion.  I 
  have made all the maps for both games and focusing now on the redrawing
  of various elements such as the enemies or menu design.

  The big news though is a brand new game, exclusive for V2 and V4 card 
  Vampire machines is a vertical shoot-em-up called *RED DWARF STAR*, 
  some fans may have noticed the posting recently. I decided to simplify 
  the title as some people understandably got confused with another 
  shooter I am proud to be part of with Richard Loewenstein 
  *Reshoot Proxima III* we are getting ever closer to the release of this
  game (later this year). Richard, I'm sure this will be our best version 
  yet, impressive coding, it seems almost magical.  Technically speaking
  I'll be pushing every part of the hardware.  The main difference 
  between the V2 and V4 is the 16bit sound for all V4.
 
  If you would like to see from a day-to-day perspective what I work on 
  please come visit my own Discord channel.  Post feedback on games, 
  suggest games to port, or just hang around in the background.  I would 
  say this is the best way to see up-to-date changes if you're 
  interested.

  https://discord.gg/K3f7UyYDT9

  Discord is my main communication channel between all the developers I 
  work with and it's far quicker to post a quick update.

  *_Other News:_*
  If you have not seen the latest info on the Apollo range of 
  Accelerators, the team have just announced the Manticore V4+ 
  Accelerator for the A600.  For more info please visit here:

  http://www.apollo-core.com/knowledge.php?b=1&note=38662

  *_Other games:_*

  *International Karate Masters*

  Another game that is quietly being worked on for V2, and V4 machines is 
  a game called *International Karate Masters*, I'll be helping with 
  background scenery and possible pixel cleanups of the characters, more 
  info coming soon.  I've been a big fan of IK+ on the Amiga and am 
  excited to be part of this.

  Amiga Forever.
