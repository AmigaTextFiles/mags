<P ALIGN="LEFT"><BLOCKQUOTE>"Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends..."</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hi, folks, and welcome back to SHOWTIME! The AmiWest 98 show (<A HREF="http://www.sacc.org/amiwest/">http://www.sacc.org/amiwest/</A>), held at the Ramada Inn in Sacramento, California, July 11 and 12, 1998, fell slightly short of events and guests (as outlined extensively not only here but in a highly organized carpet-bomb approach in many channels). I was assured that things went pretty darned good, at any rate, and I wish all the best to the organizers, participants, and businesses that put well-placed bets in the future of the Amiga, and of their related concerns.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You folks deserve a nice round of applause for all your hard work!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I didn't attend the show (I was in every major city on the NorthEast Coast of the United States and Canada, it seems, this past month) but I have with me here (by request, and with permission) some notes and writs from a few very gracious attendees. Regretfully, I don't have anything I could call comprehensive and all-inclusive (gee whiz, I wasn't home for weeks! PLUS....our main hardware here at The Amiga Monitor is being petulant: at the time of this writing, I am <not> looking forward to a rather long trip August 6, to....SOFTWARE HUT!!!!....to get an A4000T serviced. Didn't I say that last month's issue..."Where can I go to get my Amiga fixed?" I expect somewhere in this issue is an essay outlining our experience there.)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">SO, without further adieu, I give you the following:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">AmiWest '98 Show Report From Jeffrey D. Webster</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, there were no overwhelming announcements. However, we did enjoy some exciting guests. I'll start from the beginning. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Upon arriving, after a miserable ordeal with the airline, I was greeted by Christopher Aldi (ClassAct, NewYork). We were waiting for a ride to the hotel. Bill Borsari (UGN Event Coordinator) picked us up. The madness began. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">All of us were very high-strung, and excited about doing another show. All of us except Robert Hamilton (Lostman) who was sleeping in the hotel room. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sleeping? </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On Friday morning the setup was underway. I tested my machine from the hotel room, and then assisted Bill Borsari, Wayne Hunt (UGN), and Darreck Lisle (Amiga, Inc.) in setting up the UGN Booth. Not an easy task with 300 pound Destination monitors. There were some difficulties, like the fact that Darreck had to run 50 feet of phone cord out of the room and across a hall to get phone service to the booth. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The UGN, headed by Wayne Hunt, assisted by Darreck Lisle and Bill Borsari had a nice sized booth with one Destination Monitor showing the UGN Kiosk machine. Which was an A1200 running Scala. It was professionally done, and with a lot of help from Casey Halverson, it was even better. Connected with the UGN Booth was Lostman with his Amiga shirts, shorts, an sweaters. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Great looking clothes. We (the royal "We") shared a booth with Lostman, though we had no product thanks to a complete lack of luck during the days preceding the show (it's a sad story, perhaps another time). Instead, we were honored by having the UGN use ChatBox for the IRC conferences. Another Destination monitor showed the IRC conferences. Amiga, Inc. provided these monitors, by the way. They did not have to. And it was greatly appreciated. Good job Darreck. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Again, I have to give a hats-off to Bill Borsari. He dedicates his time to making these shows go off as smoothly as possible for the UGN. He has aided in keeping us well informed, and giving us a "WebCam's" view of the whole event. He is an asset to the Amiga community. Come to IRC channel #Amiga on servers linux.us.amiganet.org, or whiterose.us.amiganet.org and look for Bill to thank him for a great year of service. His IRC nickname is "tekmage". </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On with the show. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">To the immediate right of our booth was Nova Design. Kermit Woodall showed off the latest capabilities of ImageFX with the help and expertise of Corinna Cohn. She has amazing skills with ImageFX, and knows it like the back of her hand. I bought another copy of Aladdin 4D, as well as Catalyzer Volumes I & II. Big Spender, eh? </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Chris Aldi showed off his line of products from Finale Developments. As well as "Digital Quill" by Timothy Ashton. Luck was not with Chris for this show, as his A3000 went on the blink. However, he did a great job in spite of it. He's been dedicated to the Amiga since the beginning. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Harv Laser was right next to Finale Developments. Was he wearing the coveted crown of the mighty "User Representative"? No, he was humbly dressed, greeting people as they passed, and enjoying lots of talk and stories. Of course, he was also promoting AmigaZone. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">From the retail standpoint we had Lively Computers, and VisionSoft. They were far too busy for me to even get a look at what they had for any length of time. Both companies had great representatives that were friendly, and loved to talk shop. What a great place to be. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One of the most interesting conversations I had was with Bob Scharp. A very modest individual with an extremely kind wife. He has reason to brag, however, they've done a great job with the St. Louis show over the years. And I look forward to exhibiting there next year. At his display were the nicest coffee mugs an Amigan could ever see. They had a black checkmark on one side and a big black circle on the other side. Gee, sounds great, doesn't it? Well, pour some hot liquid in there -- I suggest coffee, myself -- and the checkmark becomes colored, and the large black circle becomes a smiling face. Bob told me, "This side shows a black check mark because the Amiga died, and this side shows a black circle because the Amiga died. Put a hot liquid in the cup, and the check mark becomes colorful, and the circle becomes a smiling face because the Amiga is alive again." Cheers, Bob! It was great meeting you. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One person that is always a joy to listen to because he is a virtual knowledge bank is Holger Kruse. He knows his stuff, and if you don't have Miami, GET IT! He has worked tirelessly to give us easy internet access, and he's done it with the greatest modesty. And his intentions are unbelievable. Did he do it for the money? Did he do it for the recognition? Why did he work so hard for so little? ($30 a copy is REAL cheap for a professional package like Miami) He did it for the Amiga, and it's users. At first we all questioned his intentions. Like, was he trying to take over what AmiTCP had given us? </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Certainly, but without malice. He did it because the Amiga community needed an easy way to get on the internet. And, for those of you that criticize Miami -- because WinSock is "free" -- don't knock it until you try it. WinSock is "FREE" for a reason. That is about all it is worth. Miami is far more complete a TCP/IP stack than WinSock. Enjoy what you have. Thank you Holger. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now, there were some things I just had to see. I wanted to see Carl Sassenraths seminar on REBOL (sounds like "rebel"). This man has an excellent sense of humor, and he's very down to earth. REBOL sounds like a very exciting language. I can't wait to implement a REBOL interface in some of our projects. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He described, in great detail, how REBOL really works, and what it's meant to do. He is so surprisingly Pro-Amiga. Dedicated to his creation, I suppose. Carl also spoke at the banquet dinner, where he showed slides from the very early days of Amiga. Included in the slides were pictures of the early MOS implementations of the Amiga Chipset. He had interesting stories about the trials of getting the Amiga to work. He shared many funny stories about events that took place at Amiga. RJ Mical blowing up fish in the microwave? </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Human society, anyone? ;) </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, the event we had all been waiting for. Hearing Jeff Schindler speak about the Amiga. Oops. Something came up, so Jeff was unable to attend (I'll elaborate later). Well, at least now we have Dr. Allan Havemose... </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Oops. You know the story. Big disappointment. But they more than made up for it. Frankly, everyone was pleasantly surprised by a man that very few know anything about -- besides his name. Bill McEwen was an outstanding speaker, great motivator, and despite his lack of techno-knowledge, an expert in this field. He should be trusted as a marketing director. He spoke very well, very clearly outlining the intentions and the road map for the Amiga. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Many questions were answered, without the usual thousand more that result from the answers. He covered his speech with good humor, and professionalism. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">His speech was long, but by no means unbearable (aside from there being no air conditioner in that room). He should be commended and thanked warmly for making this unexpected trip to Sacramento to stand in for Jeff Schindler and Dr. Havemose. I was not at all disappointed, and left with even more confidence than before. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">S.A.C.C. did a good job, this was their first show. There were some hitches here and there, but nothing insurmountable. And they worked hard to make it right, and extremely upset and disappointed when they couldn't. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the sometimes flaring egos and tempers, we thank you S.A.C.C. for bring a show to the western half of the states! Special thanks should go to Michael Salcedo, John Zacharias, and Alan Crandall. Thank you for your understanding, patience, and help. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'll be working with Bill Borsari and Casey Halverson on some exciting new projects for the MAE (Ohio) show in October. We have some great things for you internet show watchers. Keep your eyes peeled for press releases and news as the show gets closer. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Thanks for your attention. </P>

Subject: AmiWest Report (Part 2 of 3) The slide show
From: jweb@prime*NO*net*SPAM*.com (Jeffrey D. Webster)

Bill McEwen reveals the Amiga, Inc. plan from a marketing perspective.

--

Although my first AmiWest report was well received, I know it was lacking
the 
most important information.  What did Amiga, Inc. have to say?  More 
specifically, what happened to Schindler, Havemose, and McEwen?

I'll start with Bill McEwen.

I apologize for not posting this earlier, but I had to review the video tapes

so that I could hit upon the highlights so as to avoid a long and drawn out
post.

Bill McEwen is definitely a professional in marketing.  He understands the

basic principles, and has a great deal of knowledge beyond those basics from

experience.  He knows things you simply cannot learn in school.

On Saturday evening, July 11th, at the Banquet speech, Bill McEwen elaborated

on the Amiga, Inc. plans from the marketing perspective.  He had a clear

outline of the path they'd like to take.  I will not cover the entire 
presentation, only the new items.

The news that we had all been waiting for was the revelation of the now 
infamous "MMC".  I have no such news, because Mr. McEwen had no such news.
He did, however, have the minimum acceptable specification for the "MMC".

First the market statistics that motivate decisions in Amiga Marketing:

                    Desktop OS Market

                   1997-1998    2000 (projected)
                 -----------------------
    Windows 95/98    69.4       65.0
       Windows NT     9.2       26.2
DOS / Windows 3.x     7.7         .3
            MacOS     4.6        1.9
            Linux     2.4        4.2
 DOS (no Windows)     2.3         .3
             UNIX     1.0         .5
        OS/2 Warp      .8        1.2
           *Other     2.7         .5

* Other includes BeOS and Amiga

It is obvious that our target market cannot be the same target market as
Microsoft's.  And, according to Bill, the Amiga must do in 1999 what it did
in
1985 -- it must hit the market with an attention getting *BANG* that makes
folks think, "WOW!  I have got to get me one of these!"

The new Amiga must fall within these loose specification:


Video & Sound

* Real-time 3D rendering engine with 2D primitives
* HDTV
  - Up to 1920x1080
* RGB, PAL & NTSC encodings
* Multiple simultaneous MPEG-II decoding
* Hardware filtering scaling, color space conversions, de-interlacing
* Dolby AC-3


Multimedia / RISC System

* Scalable through multiple multimedia processors (like the Classic Amiga)
* 56k modem (minimum)
* PCI Controller
* Rich development environment
  - C++, Assembler, debugger, linker, etc.
* Native Java VM


** CHIP SPECIFICATIONS ***

* 400 million textured, bit-mapped pixels per second.  With 24-bit per
  pixel, this corresponds to 1.2GB/s of output from the 3D engine.
* Comparison: ECS Amiga has ~8M/sec max access to chip memory
* A4000/A1200 systems hav maximum access of ~32M/sec to chip memory
  (Chip memory is where graphics and audio data resides)
* 4 simultaneous MPEG-II decoders



The path that Amiga, Inc. would like to follow is:
[ Taken directly from the presentation slides ]

* Gaming
  -  Imagination is the only limitation for this platform
     [ This where the money is, and really what the vast majority of
       computer users want from their computers ]

* Internet
  - Connected to people, entertainment & information
    [ Easy connection to internet.  Complete integration ]

* Digital Media and Broadcast
  - Digitized Realism
  - Expression of the imagination

* Electronic Paradigm Shift
  - Digital appliances prolific
  - Consumer Electronics and Computers converging
    [ Other companies are trying this now, but all are going their own
      direction.  Amiga can close this gap. ]


Amiga Virtues:

* Exec - best micro kernel in 1985
  - STILL the best now
  - Fully Pre-emptive
  - For new systems we need:
    > Memory protection
    > Virtual memory
    > Multi-processor
    > Real-time
      [ Bill points out that these are the goals for the new system ]

* Custom API's made the Amiga small, fast and efficient
  - Need OpenGL
  - Need Java
  - Need Internet
  - Need Convergence API's

* I/O in Custom chips
  - Need 1394 and USB
  - Need ADSL or similar high-speed network connectivity

* AutoConfig
  - PC's have "plug and pray"
    [ Although it sounds like a joke, the Amiga, despite it's lack of drivers
      is more truly plug and PLAY ]

* Dynamically configurable localization
  - STILL the only game in town
    [ Bill commented that this is a very important issue to Dr. Havemose
]


Other points of interest:

McEwen stresses that the new Amiga has to stand out from the crowd.  Pointing
out that current PC options are intimidating, not easy to use, expensive,
and
are often obsolete shortly after their release.  This causes a great burden
on an already weary PC purchasing public.  The goals they have set forth
will
lead to a personal computer where "personal" again has meaning.

This has always been a strong point of the Amiga.  McEwen mentions he's not
from this camp [Amiga], but he sees a community.  He stated in his presentation
that, "Gateway didn't have this big plan for the Amiga.  What they thought
they
had were patents and trademarks, they didn't know that all of you [the Amiga
community] came with it." The room broke with laughter.  Indeed, Gateway
could 
not have expected such a resounding response from what was thought to be
a dead 
platform.

I believe they see us now, and not as a burden, but an asset.  So, for those
of you that have any doubts about their sincerity, give them a chance.  Hear
them out.  I know you will be as surprised as I was by their dedication.


All of the bulleted text above was taken from the slides during the
presentation. Mr. McEwen promised the bulk of them will be posted on the
Amiga, Inc. site.
---

Now, on to the "issues" that seemed to infuriate so many in the Amiga
community.

What happened to Schindler?  Did his wife give birth to a bouncing baby boy?
Did Dr. Havemose deliver their child?

Needless to say, these rumors were unfounded... and just plain silly.  First,
Dr. Havemose is not a medical doctor.  Second, if Jeff's wife is pregnant,
it's news to he and his wife.

What happened to Dr. Havemose then?

I'll answer that in one sentence:  More contract negotiations required their
further attention which distracted them from less pressing issues, like shows.
I'd rather have them there working, than at a show playing.

So, to clarify, Jeff Schindler and Allan Havemose were not able to attend
AmiWest because they had Amiga business to attend to.

Thank you for your attention.

Transcriptions of the speech will be posted as they are completed.

<beezo>	the only MAJOR OS is 95/Netware
<TheBarron>	That's what I was waiting for to ask, actually.. Let's just say I'm just Joe User.. what does REBOL mean for me?
<RMerlin>	beezo: Well still larger than OpenSco or such :)
<Carl>	Java and C++, etc. are systems programming languages, and that is not the intent of REBOL.
<echo_TA>	beezo: please, no AMIGA bashing
<beezo>	rmerlin, yet we don't have 10% of the support that they have
<Lorus>	beezo:it's always been a MAJOR platform, just never marketted properly.
<TheBarron>	rmerlin: Did these folks not get AmigaNet help for this channel? This is kinda sad :)
<Carl>	REBOL aims at intercommunications, whether between computers or people.
<echo_TA>	we're trying to rectify your assertions
<TheBarron>	shutup and let the man talk
<beezo>	echo, im NOT bashing it!! I'm looking at it REALISTCALLY!!!

<echo_TA>	please
<echo_TA>	Carl doesn't like moderated, but...
<beezo>	yeah im gonna bash the amiga when I have a $3,000+ amiga with PPC
<Carl>	REBOL brings a new abstraction to the scripting/programming process, that I personally believe will be more powerful that of object oriented approaches.
<snapper>	Ya, but he types slow ;)
<AAlley>	Carl: What these non-believers need is to see some smaple code. That might expain it some.

<TheBarron>	Actually, I don't want to see any code. I want to see a use.
<Womble>	What if you want to use it to control an OO program? Wouldn't it be useful to have OOP support then?
<beezo>	carl, but this is only good for admin type people
<Carl>	For instance, if you are expressing the elements and behaviors of a GUI, you want to speak in GUI terms.

<Carl>	echo: That bot is probably to complex an example.... but how about this.
<snapper>	TheBarron Yes, we'll be using Rebol for our portable GUI applications
<beezo>	carl, I don't see NOVELL listed on your website for support!!  Will you do a Novell Netware port?
<Carl>	Here are a few lines.... to give you the flavor...
<TheBarron>	snapper: so the actual code sitting on an individual machine that renders/operates the GUI is in REBOL?
<Mitchman>	beezo: get outta here! :)
<TheBarron>	Why the heck do we care about NOVELL in this channel at this moment? :)
<Carl>	The first ... and traditional, is the hello world:
<Carl>	print "Hello World"
<snapper>	TheBarron Yes, we write it once and any machine/os that has Rebol can run our app

<VideoTeck>	carl: do you think bill minds about the amiga ?
<Ratleto>	Am I being ignored...?
<Carl>	So perhaps you don't think Bill will read that.... then:
<snapper>	Womble One would write scripts in C because they don;t want to learn another language, that's why we licensed FPL
<Zeqk>	Sorry to interrupt...when  Mr. Sassenrath is done talking answering questions about Rebol, will he have time to answer some questions about the Amiga?
<Carl>	loop 10000 [send billg@microsoft.com "Amiga Will Arise"]
<TheBarron>	Carl: so the mechanism for actually sending that message are within REBOL, or where? Sound highly interpreted in that example.. optimization?
<Carl>	Now, perhaps, you get the idea.
<Womble>	Let me guess... the first successful REBOL programs will be bulk mailers, right? ;-)
<Exploderi>	the ultimate spamming language :P
<Jkay>	heh
<TheBarron>	Zeqk: yeah.. But he's answering REBOL atm.. he'll be gone later, then we can bicker :)
<Carl>	What about other times of messages.....
<XCal-tech>	Carl: so Rebol will be a simpler way to make more efficient tasks for those who are not code "gods" ?
<Mitchman>	Carl: what do you figure the chances are in a marketplace dominated with IDE's containing "Visual" in their names?
*	TheBarron shuts up since Carl is obviously on a line of thought irrelevant of questions atm :)
<snapper>	TheBarron Lets put it in real world terms, YOU could write a browser in a couple days in Rebol, or an email app in an after noon.. I meant you personally
<RMerlin>	Mitchman: VisualRebol will have to appear later I guess. :)
<Carl>	What's the difference between data and code? None. The language is highly reflective..... and that's where we get into the REBOL "Relative Expressions"

<Carl>	Mitchman: How about everything overloading.  Relative expressions interpreted in given contexts.  + - * / can mean what you want.  Normally, when working in the "standard" contexts, they have given definitions.  But you can create any context you like.

<XCal-tech>	15 pages...geezus....my C++ teacher would die of an heart attack :)

<snapper>	Carl OK, here's the biggie, how does a rebol developer protect his work from being borrowed by anyone.
<TheBarron>	nah.. that'll be different :)
<Carl>	Merko: With the REBOL header, these machine specific requirements can be called out. This allows a user to know about such things prior to downloading or running the script.
<Carl>	Mitch: There will be a linux version.
<Mitchman>	source distribution?
<Mitchman>	or binary only?
<Amirc>	Carl: Is REBOL just for AMIGAs now ?
<Carl>	So, to wrap it up.... the free version will be available for many platforms... but makes you wonder how we will stay in business, right?
<TheBarron>	no. It's about cross-platform compatibility for one. Take a look at www.rebol.com

<Echo_TA>	Zinn: I take it you missed Carl's little talk
<_ego1>	Merko: There are several other very good reasons for not releasing a program.  Like there are 4 other browsers to compete with so they might lose money on production

<Echo_TA>	Zinn: yup
<Womble>	_ego1: What, duplication of bytes has suddenly become expensive?
<Merko>	_ego1: Selling it through the web, without support, etc. costs virtually nothing.. so if they had a finished product, they would release it, no?

<Zinn>	At least not anytime soon.
<Womble>	Zinn: Everyone has to begin somewhere. But some lusers will never be able to think straight enough to program.
<Merko>	Jkay: Well, I'm deducing that you wouldn't cancel it if it indeed was 100% finished. :)
<beezo>	zinn, it really a pointless program right now
<Echo_TA>	Zinn: Want some example REBOL script?
<TheBarron>	First of all, no one said they had a finished product. Secondly, even if they did have a finished product, it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to release it if, for some unforeseen reason, they couldn't properly update/support it. And maybe, just maybe, there are considerations beyond the actual code itself, eh?
<Adonnis>	So was there anything new announced today?

<_ego1>	Womble: And MDII "works" as well. Aint finished though

<Ginko>	Ahhhhh....
<cybertrac>	We track various uses of the celebrity's name or image.  For instance, many sites will employ a celebrity's name in the metatags or in spamdexes to attract users to a site simply to create impressions.  For instance, there is a punk rock band in New Jersey who used Alyssa Milano's name in theri tags; why, I'm not real
<cybertrac>	ly certain.  This is discussed in greater detail in my recent article "Empowering Celebrity's In Cyberspace" available at my website: rmslaw.com and Cybertracker's website: cyber-trackers.com.

<CommandTA>	lambertus: SWRead seems to be the best program for synths ... the say and speak commands work pretty well, and you can plug those into any file management system (diskmasker, opus, etc) but the amiga is suprisingly flexable as far as speech goes.

<Lambertus>	LOGGING A BANQUET????  "Digitise that chicken and send over IRC"   ; )
