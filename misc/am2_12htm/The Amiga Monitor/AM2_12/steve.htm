<P ALIGN="LEFT">I recently purchased a new PC with a Pentium II 400-MHz CPU, plus Windows 95
OSR2.  It came well equipped with all the goodies -- an 11.5-GB UltraDMA drive,
64 MB of SDRAM, an Intel 740 2D/3D accelerator with 8 MB, a 32X CD-ROM and 56k
modem.  There was also the Corel WordPerfect Suite onboard and plenty of
shovelware to ignore and maybe someday even uninstall.  In the time I've had
it, I've gone ahead and added a Diamond Monster 3D2 accelerator using the
Voodoo2 chipset and 8 MB of RAM.  That's 16 MB total graphics RAM.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The machine is a monster.  It plays Quake2 and Jedi Knight at 800x600 with
silky-smooth framerates.  It raytraces rapidly as well.  Using the 3x3
Oversampling setting in Cinema4D XL 5.1, and with every other option maxed
out, it can raytrace the staircase test scene at 800x600x24 in 29 seconds! 
This, even though the algorithms used in the PC version of Cinema4D are slower
than those used in the Amiga and PowerMac versions.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So why mention all this?  Well, mainly because this is the first PC I've owned
which offers an experience similar to what I get every day on my '060 Amiga. 
By this I mean that the new PC launches apps and opens/closes windows with the
same blinding speed as my Amiga -- and I'm running my Amiga on a 16-bit
Workbench rather than some super-fast 2-color screen.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The new PC multitasks smoothly and has even played two videos at once with no
discernible loss in framerate.  There are some rough spots -- it still takes a
very long time to bring file download windows to the front, for example, while
both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer remain stupendously slow at the
'Go Back' function, but overall, these new PCs offer a very nice and rapid
computing experience and will certainly please most buyers -- until something
goes wrong!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I have enough experience to realize that the heavy gaming use I put a PC
through will sooner or later cause the grenading of Win95, and when that
happens, fixing the mess won't be easy, or pretty.  But even with this
incredible drawback, the fact remains that these new PCs are a wake-up call. 
We have heard for a long time that we need more CPU power, but when you
compare a 68060 Amiga to PowerMacs and PCs in the 200-MHz range, the Amiga
simply feels faster.  It is not, of course, categorically faster at
everything; we all know that CPU-hungry apps will show the advantage of
PowerMacs and Pentium PCs, but nonetheless, for most computing functions, an
'060 @ 50MHz Amiga at least holds its own or flat-out blows away the Mac and PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But not anymore.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I say this because, having come to the Amiga after owning PowerMacs and
Pentium PCs first, I have always been behind just about any scheme to get us a
faster miggy.  And that brings us to the Amiga, Inc. plan.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Clearly, not everyone at this magazine is happy with the AI plan.  The
newsgroups have also revealed many detractors.  Typically, the anger is over
whether or not the new machine will be a 'real' Amiga, or maybe because the
current course has gummed up the PowerPC or DEC Alpha paths.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There's probably no easy answer that can satisfy everyone.  I can say that I
think AI is bending over backwards to offer legacy support through emulation. 
I can say that AI's announcement immediately improved the PPC outlook thanks
to forcing phase 5 and Haage & Partner to become uneasy allies.  I can say a
lot of things, but in the end every Amigan will have to sit down and think
long and hard over where they want to be.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In a previous article, I expressed my opinion that going head-to-head against
Wintel in a desktop war, using a PPC-based Amiga, was a bad idea.  At one time
I thought it was a good idea, but now I have that loaded P-II 400.  Sure, a
400-MHz PPC Amiga would be better than the PC.  We know that, but Joe and Jane
Public do not.  The PPC Amiga would be priced comparably (we hope!) to a
Wintel PC.  Thus, anyone who appreciated the finer things in computing would
choose the Amiga.  Alas, most people have no idea, and educating them would
require a stunningly expensive ad campaign.  It just couldn't work.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Amiga, Inc. plan is to compete in arenas that Wintel does not yet own or
dominate.  Thus it would seem that the main focus will be on a set-top game
console for $500 or less.  I personally cannot imagine a better strategy.  The
Wintel market has an installed base of over 100 million users.  That's a lot. 
That's a big enemy.  But there are still over 5 BILLION people in the world. 
The game is not yet over.  If it was, Microsoft and Intel would not be so
famously paranoid.  They realize it can all end for them.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Remember that this century started with a much different power structure from what
we see today.  The supreme superpower was the British Empire.  This was the
largest empire in world history.  Great Britain was so incredibly rich and
powerful that they built their navy on the 'Two-Power Standard,' which meant
it had to be as large as the next two largest navies in the world combined. 
Those navies belonged to France and Russia -- the US Navy and the German
Kriegsmarine were quite far behind.  Indeed,  it hadn't been so long since the
US Navy had been in peril of destruction at the hands of Chile over an
international incident.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We obviously can't make direct analogies between global empires and giant
corporations.  Microsoft and Intel have in many ways a more insidious type of
power than that of the great nations.  But it's nonetheless true that the
British Empire has faded, the USA has risen to world dominance, and that no
empire of any kind lasts forever.  This means the USA will inevitably decline
and that Wintel will fall.  It is the nature of things that giants have
poodles nipping at their heels.  Wolves today prowl the same territory once
roamed by Tyrannosaurus rex.  When T. rex ruled the forest, the ancestors of
wolves were tiny, insignificant furballs.  So given time, things change.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So I for one cast my vote with Amiga, Inc.  There is no guarantee that their
plan will achieve success, but it may be the only plan which does not
guarantee failure.  From all I have read, it seems they will take advantage of
the AmigaOS's modularity to provide users with systems that can be scaled up
or scaled down.  We will be given wide latitude in how our GUI will look.  We
will have legacy support through emulation.  We will even have parallel
development by third parties on PPC and DEC Alpha machines.  We will have a
high degree of digital convergence and integration.  In many ways it all
sounds too good to be true, especially the very tight schedule being followed
to give us all this by the end of '99.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We will all know whether the new machine is a true Amiga after we turn one on
and have a little time to play around with it.  Success in the marketplace
will depend on the available software -- the games which must be in
development right now, along with the word processors, web browsers and all
the other applications that make up a full computing experience.  AI did not
take the 'safe' approach of simply going with a PPC port; they have instead
gone for the gusto with a new and hopefully revolutionary hardware platform. 
Chances are that they will either succeed or fail in spectacular fashion -- I
see no middle ground here.  For all of us who value choice and quality, I hope
it's the former.  In any case, as a friend of mine once told me, "If you reach
for the stars, at least you don't come up with a handful of mud.'</P>
