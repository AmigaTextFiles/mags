<P ALIGN="LEFT">Assistant Editor's Notes: In light of having received a number of email feedback expositions regarding our publications' "negativisms", I, on behalf of </I>The Amiga Monitor, <I>offer the following, to assuage the assault  :)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The following URL / link will take you to an article that appeared in the Chicago Tribune online. Scroll down to the "</I>Recent Articles" section,  07/10/98: The Return of Amiga.<I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><A HREF="http://cgi.chicago.tribune.com/tech/frontpage/0,1714,5,00.html">http://cgi.chicago.tribune.com/tech/frontpage/0,1714,5,00.html</A></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">P.S.: The cost of reprinting previously published materials is prohibitive. Link direction is a way of bringing information to the readers, rather than just wishing we had the resources to expend on actual text.  :)</P>
