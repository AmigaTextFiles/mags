<BR><BR>


<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">DOS Beer</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">requires you to use your own can opener, and requires you to read the
directions carefully before opening the can. Originally only
came in an 8-oz. can, but now comes in a 16-oz. can. However, the can is
divided into 8 compartments of 2 oz. each, which have to be accessed
separately. Soon to be discontinued, although a lot of people are going
to keep drinking it after it's no longer available.</P>


<BR><BR>


<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Mac Beer</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Comes in a 32-oz. can. Considered by many to be a "light" beer. All the
cans look identical. When you take one from the fridge, it
opens itself. The ingredients list is not on the can. If you call to ask
about the ingredients, you are told that "you don't need to know." A
notice on the side reminds you to drag your empties to the trashcan.</P>


<BR><BR>


<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Windows 3.1 Beer</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The world's most popular. Comes in a 16-oz. can that looks a lot like
Mac Beer's. Requires that you already own a DOS
Beer. Claims that it allows you to drink several DOS Beers
simultaneously, but in reality you can only drink a few of them, very
slowly, especially slowly if you are drinking the Windows Beer at the
same time. Sometimes, for apparently no reason, a can of Windows Beer
will explode when you open it.</P>


<BR><BR>


<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">OS/2 Beer</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Comes in a 32-oz can. Does allow you to drink several DOS Beers
simultaneously. Allows you to drink Windows 3.1 Beer
simultaneously too, but somewhat slower. Advertises that its cans won't
explode when you open them, even if you shake them up. You never
really see anyone drinking OS/2 Beer, but the manufacturer
(International Beer Manufacturing) claims that 9 million six-packs have
been sold.</P>


<BR><BR>


<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Windows 95 Beer</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can't buy it yet, but a lot of people have taste-tested it and claim
it's wonderful. The can looks a lot like Mac Beer's
can, but tastes more like Windows 3.1 Beer. It comes in 32-oz. cans, but
when you look inside, the cans only have 16 oz. of beer in them. Most
people will probably keep drinking Windows 3.1 Beer until their friends
try Windows 95 Beer and say they like it. The ingredients list, when
you look at the small print, has some of the same ingredients that come
in DOS beer, even though the manufacturer claims that this is an
entirely new brew.</P>


<BR><BR>


<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Windows NT Beer</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Comes in 32-oz. cans, but you can only buy it by the truckload. This
causes most people to have to go out and buy bigger
refrigerators. The can looks just like Windows 3.1 Beer's, but the
company promises to change the can to look just like Windows 95 Beer's -
after Windows 95 beer starts shipping. Touted as an "industrial
strength" beer, and suggested only for use in bars.</P>


<BR><BR>


<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Unix Beer</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Comes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz. to 64 oz.
Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even
though they claim that all the different brands taste almost identical.
Sometimes the pop-tops break off when you try to open them, so you have
to have your own can opener around for those occasions, in which case
you either need a complete set of instructions, or a friend who has been
drinking Unix Beer for several years.</P>


<BR><BR>


<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">AmigaDOS Beer</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The company has gone out of business, but their recipe has been picked
up by some weird German company, so now this
beer will be an import. This beer never really sold very well because
the original manufacturer didn't understand marketing. Like Unix Beer,
AmigaDOS Beer fans are an extremely loyal and loud group. It originally
came in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz. cans too. When this
can was originally introduced, it appeared flashy and colorful, but the
design hasn't changed much over the years, so it appears dated now.
Critics of this beer claim that it is only meant for watching TV anyway.</P>


<BR><BR>


<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">VMS Beer</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Requires minimal user interaction, except for popping the top and
sipping.However cans have been known on occasion to explode,
or contain extremely un-beer-like contents. Best drunk in high pressure
development environments. When you call the manufacturer for the list
of ingredients, you're told that is proprietary and referred to an
unknown listing in the manuals published by the FDA. Rumors are that
this was once listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference as a
tranquilizer, but no one can claim to have actually seen it.</P>


<BR><BR>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">The biggest problem is before you can drink any one of them you have to
buy a really expensive bag of chips to go with it.</P>
