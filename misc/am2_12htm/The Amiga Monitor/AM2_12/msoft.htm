<P ALIGN="LEFT">To Whom It May Concern:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The stat of the computer manufacture industry and indeed, the computer
industry as a whole, sickens me.  The obvious alliance between manufactures
such as yourself and the microsoft corporation is to the detriment of all
consumers (except perhaps Bill Gates in his consumption of other companies) and
smacks of the lowest cowardice.  In shopping for a new computer I find it
increasingly difficult to find any machine that does not bear the taint of
Microsoft software, as well as being accompanied with tis inferior peripherals.
It is obvious that you have been coerced and more likely threatened, by that
corporation customization, I have yet to find a company that will allow me to
build a PC free of Microsoft products.  There are a variety of reasons why any
rational, freedom-loving consumer should be extremely displeased with this
state of affairs.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The purchase of your computer, which are riddled with Microsoft's
applications like parasites on some large animal, deposits more money in the
coffers of the corporation.  These funds serve, in turn, to fuel it's
acquisitions of other, smaller, companies, it's extortion of manufacturers, its
Orwellian forays into media, it's systematic domination of the information
super-highway, to fund its legal army, necessary to a corporation with it's
level of quasi-legal, plagiaristic, underhanded dealing, and feed the
Megolomania of Bill Gates.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">That microsoft rules the world of computers cannot be denied.  It is
wholly unchallenged in its domination of the PC operating system market.  It
has actually offered aid and assistance to its sole serious competitor,
Macintosh.  Why, one might wonder does Microsoft not deal the fatal blow to
this slowly dying company.  Why is it allowed to sputter along while Microsoft
has swallowed all its other competitors.  The answer is a stroke of the purest
evil genius.  Thanks to the impotent half-presence of Macintosh computers,
Microsoft is not a legal monopoly.  It's browser's strangle-hold is now almost
complete thanks to illegal bundling, inceentives to internet service providers,
an effective web-pages, the preinstallation of corporations like yourself, the
illegal use of Sun Microsystem's Java, and the blatant imitation of the first
ingenious web-browser Netscape.  It also produces the vast majority of all
spread-sheet, word-processing, and online reference programs; all of which are
blatant imitations of the original, superior programs.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The majority of this software is blatant and inferior plagiarism of
earlier, superior works.  Micorsoft Word's use is amazingly far-spread.  It was
certainly not the first program of its sort, and holds no advantages against
any other.  However thanks to bundling of companies such as yourself, and
preconceived compatibility issues it has achieved a wholly underserved
dominance.  Shortly after the Multimedia revolution of the early to
mid-ninties, several CD-ROM encyclopedias appeared, including Grolier's, and
Compton's.  Microsoft Encarta hold no superiority over these, but thanks to
many of the same reasons it has come to rule the market.  Much of the same can
be said for Quicken and Money.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Even the cornerstone of Microsoft's evil empire, Windows, is totally
derivative of the earlier superior Macintosh System.  The concept of navigation
by Windows and Icons was pioneered by this apple system of which Windows is but
a pale shadow.  Both featured expandable rectangles containing small graphics,
which when clicked on twice by a mouse, begins a program or opens a file.  Both
also feature, near the top of these rectangles, words such as File and Edit,
which when similarly manipulated display "pull down menus".  Windows offers
absolutely no advantage whatsoever over any of its predecessors, such as DOS of
Macintosh System and is also inferior to later developments such as Linux, OS2
Warp, or later editions of the Macintosh System.  Its disadvantages are
numerous indeed.  While running, Windows 95' devours RAM, and is extremely
hesitant to release the user from its grasp.  Even at the DOS prompt Windows
unrelinquishing in it's hold on one's computer.  In bitter irony, this creates
a need for the one Microsoft program that Microsoft has no intention of ever
marketing further, DOS.  Using the first disk of the DOS installation set is
the only way to achieve a boot truly free of window's resource-devouring grasp.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Windows also took a puzzling technological step backwards to the days
of early Macintoshes in the necessity to perform a shutdown before turning of
your computer.  If this is not performed portions of ones hard drive become
corrupted.  This would seem no more than a nuisance except that Windows 95
freezes approximately ten times more frequently than DOS or Windows 3.x.  It is
an unadvertised feature that the spaces of hard drive corrupted often occur in
vital areas of competitor's files.  In essence Windows 95 is designed to freeze
so that one is forced to turn off the computer, allowing Microsoft to subtly
destroy a competing product.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One of the primary selling points of Window 95' was its touted "user
friendliness".  Microsoft's motive in this is not ease of use but in fact
misinstruction.  A graphical version of DOS would present no great diffulty to
the understanding of novice computer.  Instead the implemented systems of
desktops and icons is highly misleading as to the actual functions performed by
the computer.  The understanding o files and directories, a basic knowledge
crucial to the understanding of computer operation, is purposely
misrepresented.  The Windows Explorer system of management does nothing to help
this situation.  It is actually preset to hide all file extensions.  The
cunning o these apparent shortcomings is that it keeps new computer users never
actually learn anything about computers thought the may use Microsoft
applications every day.  This reduces the number of the literate  computer
users in the world, hence the number competitive startups, the number of people
who realize the superiority of non-Microsoft application, the number of people
who understand Microsoft's practices.  Another learning tool, Q-Basic, present
in DOS and the original Windows is conspicuously missing from Windows 95'
despite its huge size.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The one act of plagiarism that cannot be denied by any controtion of
reality is the clear connection between Netscape and Internet Explorer.  These
programs are almost identical in both function and appearance.  Even Netscape's
letter-N-in-globe animation in the upper right-hand corner returned in the same
position, but with an E.  It is also typical to note that some versions of
Microsoft Internet Explorer produce error messages when the home sight is
specified as other than www.microsoft.com.  Errors are also frequently produced
when running Netscape under Windows 95'.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">it is impossible to escape these products.  When purchasing a PC ther
are no options for purchase without Microsoft packaged software.  This is due
to contracts with Microsoft entered into by all major PC manufacturers
requiring the "bundling" of various Microsoft programs.  Not only does this
raise the price of computers, but it gives Microsoft the funds necessary to
create further restive pacts.  The Gateway corporation is one offender.  The
only way in which one my buy a computer from Gateway without Microsoft Software
is to order it without a hard disk, and install a separate hard disk oneself.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Microsoft also uses similar tactics to coerce software manufacturers
not directlycompeting with it to make their software compatible only with
Microsoft Windows 95.  As stated before this systems offers no real advantage,
but in many cases a hindrance to performance.  The function this does serve is
to force the hand of people wanting to use this software into purchsing Windows
95, in addition to the inevitable profit for Microsot.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Microsoft, however is not content with the mere control fo the world's
PCs.  It has created a Server operating Syste, Windows NT, which has now
proliferated over the world's netowrks.  It has released peripherals including
mice, keyboards, and joysticks.  Soon it will turn to hardware and PC
producti0on and then, you Sirs, shall be swiftly either media.  Its' presence
is already felt greatly on the internet.  It would be a simple matter for the
next version of the Internet Explorer to block out offensive
(read:competitors', or opponents') web pages.  It has also formed an alliance
with NBC, launching the successful MSNBC netowrk.  Now Microsoft has entrused
itself with giving America its (highly edited) news.  It shall be interesting
to see how objectively this conglomerate reports upon the much belated
anti-trust hearings againgst Microsoft.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The picture of the future painted by Mr. Gates in the explaining his
self-titled "simplicity jihad" is the most frightening aspect of his diabolical
agenda.  He glowingly describes a future in which all technology is
computerized with the use of Windows variants.  All of these miniature
computers are networked (most liekly though the Microsoft Netowrk) and received
software updates from Microsoft for a regular fee.  This vision does not seem
to contain any competition.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Should this agenda be accomplished, and given Microsoft's unprecedented
success in the past, the most apt description appears not "simplicity" but
"unprecedented control".  Labor is rapidly becoming computerized; in the time
it takes for this prediction to come to fruition all work may be done from a
computer console.  A good deal of recreation is already done through computers,
as is most communication.  These trends show no signs of stopping and when
coupled with the order suggested by Bill Gates would amount to not only an
incredible potential for surveilance but perhaps total contol over every aspect
of human life.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This appalling state of affairs, despite recent token government
intervention, is only worsening.  A great factor in construction of this iron
grip on America is the week willed compliance of computer manufactures like
yourselves.  This grip will only tighten unless those companies return to the
tradition of Consumer Choice.  You must allow customers to mandate their own
software packages, which will also give them the option of lowering the cost of
computers by jettisioning undesired application.  It is the only way in which
the most promising modern industry can advance into the next century with any
hope of freedom.</P>
