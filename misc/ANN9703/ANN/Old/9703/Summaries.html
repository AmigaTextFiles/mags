</B></FONT> (26-Mar-97

<UL>Stefan Mueller denies a rumour that said
that a consortium of investors, amongst them the [German] Metro-Gruppe,
will &quot;have bought&quot; the Amiga on the 28.03.97 [notice, the mail was
written before that date and despite that is using the past tense].
This is not possible, because the 28.03 is a bank holiday in Germany.

<UL>&quot;Michael&quot; forwards an Open Letter to German
Amiga Magazin, which is based upon a survey on the Internet. Some of
the criticisms expressed in the letter are that the articles sound like
advertisements, that 1/3 of the mag is &quot;wasted&quot; for the magazine &quot;Amiga-Games&quot;,
that the layout of the game magazine does not match the rest of the pages,
that many reviews have been announced but never written, that there are
no criticisms against advertisers, that the cover CD is not interesting
and up-to-date, that workshops are spread about many issues and that there
are too many articles about the Internet.

is a one man project.</CITE> <CITE>Doing a whole new system [A\Box] at the complexity

before will be a problem for them somewhere along the project.</CITE> Phase5
have scrapped all their previous research for a UNIX kernel - although
Dave points out that all their research may have been <CITE>a
port of the Exec running on the 68K</CITE>. He doesn't think Phase5 wanted
pOS at any time. But since proDAD can <CITE>support the OS on anyone's PowerPC system,

<UL>According to Bernhard Lindner, who
forwards a reply to a mail he sent proDAD; Phase5 didn't have
much developer support in the past, so that proDAD was forced to
get all their information through Haage&amp;Partner. They say that
since delivery of the card 4 months ago, nothing new has been
developed and they assume that the only explanation for this is
&quot;bye bye&quot;. proDAD are still interested in working together with
Phase5, though.

<UL>Dave Haynie seems to be fairly busy commenting
posts... ;-) This time he spoke about RTG and the advantages that would
have resulted if the Amiga had had implemented this. He says that Zorro 3
is as fast as EISA and would have been as cheap as PCI; but only if the volume
had been there. He said he <CITE>picked PCI as the winner the day [he]
read the first specs [..] in 1992</CITE>.<BR>
<CITE>Now we have a system that's in all ways superior to the PC, while at
the same time using their best advantages, like cheap I/O chips, for
ourselves</CITE>. <CITE>Life's getting good, even if I only get 2-3 hours
sleep a night.</CITE>.

<UL>In a recent article, Dave Haynie commented
on a lot of subjetcs, among others the A\Box, Unix, the AmigaOS, AGA, AAA, PCI....
The article is far too long to mention everything here, and it is
full of sentences that could be quoted here. Instead, please check
out the real article, it's definately worth reading:

<UL>Jason Compton doesn't know much about the
new Amiga that will supposedly be produced by Direct Software either.
He says he just received the spec sheet we've all seen by now, but
that his reply mail to Direct Software in the UK bounced, so that he
doesn't really know anything, too.

the motherboard. <CITE>There are
all the experiences from nearly 10 years of Amiga accelerator boards
gathered, in that you better put the main performance determining
