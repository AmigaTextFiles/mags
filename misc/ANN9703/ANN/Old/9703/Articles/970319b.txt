C'est la JAVA!  (Interview)

Interview between Amiga Online and the Vice-President of Finale 
Development, Alain Penders.

A new company working hard for porting Java on the Amiga.

A new browser will be created too with the new "Java Virtual Machine": 
MOca.

MOca comes with all its tools: JIT compiler and AWT (Java GUI).

Certainly the best commercial initiative for the Amiga since a long 
time.


AOLM: Could you present your company for all the Amigausers?
~~~~~
- Finale Development, Inc. is, as you know, a new company. The company 
is
 based on Florida, but in practice the eight of us are spread all over
 the world. A few people in the USA, some in Europe and one in 
Australia.


AOLM: What is your role inside Finale Development?
~~~~~
- My official title is Vice President, but in general I run the 
company.
  I'm the project coordinator for both the browser and java project
  aswell, and also program some parts of them.


AOLM: Did you get a licence from Sun (Solaris code) for MOca?
~~~~
- Not yet, as the actual Java engine is completely written from scratch 
-
  so no license needed. (The Sun Java engine was intended as an 
example,
  and is a real slow Java implementation.)


AOLM: What kinds of langages do you use, in this project?
~~~~
- Well, the main code is written in C... very portable and easy to 
debug.
  (We also develop large parts of our code on Unix machines, because of
  the better debugging possibilities. For MOca, there are also some 
large
  parts of assembler, since we want the program to be faaaaast. These
  parts are carefully picked.. only what is really needed... don't want
  to make porting to other CPU's a pain either though.


AOLM: Do you think that Java can give to the Amiga new impulse?
~~~~~
- Well, do you think that running Word Perfect will give the Amiga some
  new impulse ? I doubt we'll get a lot of new Amiga users by it, but 
the
  ones that are still here will at last get access to some decent
  software. For pOS though, I surely think this will make a difference.


AOLM: Do you use unix run-time libraries that exists on the amiga?
~~~~~
- No. Ixemul is nice for porting existing unix software to amiga, but 
for
  a new product it would be really bloating.


AOLM: If all Amiga developers goes Java, the Amiga will loose it's
~~~~~ adavantages

- Yes, definitely. There are two kinds of people that we want to use 
our
  Java: developpers who want to reach a larger market.. ie. sell their
  product to PC users; and Amiga users who want to get access to more
  software, like Corel Office, WP, etc. Native applications will always
  rule... whether on Amiga or not. But you first got to have decent
  native applications, which has always been a problem on Amiga.


AOLM: Are you really sure that your Java system will be 100% compatible
~~~~  with the others on PC??

- Of course.


AOLM: What is the performance of MOca regarding PC plateform?
~~~~~
- We're using the same techniques in MOca as are used in the decent 
Java
  implementations on PC. How it'll feel in the end depends a lot on 
your
  CPU power though. We can't make the 68k faster.


AOLM: And for example on a 060 Amiga?
`~~~~
- I can't give any numbers about that at this point in time, as MOca is
  too early in development. Once we can run something decent as WP, we
  can provide those numbers.


AOLM: What is the state of development?
~~~~~
- WE've been working on it for about 6 months now. Took a lot of time 
to
  study all the optimizing theories, garbage collection etc. We have
  several parts ready and implemented (like AWT), but still have quite 
a
  bit to do. Just coding work though, the design is completely done.


AOLM: Can you explain AWT?
~~~~
- AWT stands for Abstract Windowing Toolkit. It's Java's GUI 
programming
  interface. Java uses standard functions to build GUI's. Those 
functions
  have to be remapped to Amiga GUI calls, which is what the AWT
  implementation does. We use ClassAct for this.


AOLM: Did you made marketing plans before starting the project?
~~~~~
- Yes we did.


AOLM: What about java script for your browser?
~~~~~
- We haven't worked on Java Script, but from what I've seen it's very
  easy. So, after the browser is done we may put some people on it.


AOLM: Explorer and Netscape are free, and the Net progress quickly.
~~~~~ What's your feeling, could you concurence Bill Gate$ in this 
domain
      ? (Last year Browers don't work anymore!)

- Well, the browsers themselves don't really change that much anymore.
  It's more luxury extra's now, like built-in IRC. Whether we can 
follow
  those things, time will tell.


AOLM: The frames now, tomorow Java....time will tell... so you can add
~~~~~ features like real audio, activex, vrml and so on?

- ActiveX definitely not. Even if we could, I don't think we want to
  support a Micro$oft standard like that. Real Audio depends on the
  users, if they buy our software we can finance getting a real audio
  license. We won't do VRML before there are decent PPC computers to 
run
  it on. Amiga is just to slow for that Or 68k based Amiga's anyway.


AOLM: Did your products will be available regarding to your schedules?
~~~~~~
- We try to stick to the schedules. Development is often an 
unpredictable
  proces though, so don't shoot if we're a little too late.. or too
  early.


AOLM: Do you target to programm specifics routines for the graphics
~~~~~ cards?

- We will support the RTG options available: CyberGfx and Picasso... 
for
  image decoders etc, we may make optimized versions.


AOLM: What do you think about Amiga "problems"? (about the buyout)
~~~~~
- Amiga problems... good question. I'm not really taking a position in
  those matters. Noone will buy a computer that is out of development,
  680x0 is just to slow for today, AA is far from good today. Hopefully
  the new PPC computers like Pios One will bring the future.


AOLM: As a developer, can you talk about Pos?
~~~~~
- I can't say too much about pOS because of the NDA we have with 
ProDAD.
  I think pOS looks very promising. In my oppinion, pOS is what AmigaOS
  would have been today if C= was still alive... the successor of 
AmigaOS
  on PowerPC.


AOLM: What about ARexx & MOca?
~~~~~
- Well, normally there is not much use for ARexx with MOca. If you want
  to start a Java program from arexx, you call MOca with the parameters
  on the command line. I've read some things about Rexx inside of 
Java..
  if that API gets established, we will support it.


AOLM: pOS look like Amiga OS and perhaps some licence problems will
~~~~~occurs with the new buyer?

- Hmmm... I doubt it. Of course, it's always easy to sue someone.


AOLM: Perhaps you want to talk about something else ?
~~~~~
- I think most things have been said.


AOLM: Thank you and Good luck
~~~~~

- Same to you.
