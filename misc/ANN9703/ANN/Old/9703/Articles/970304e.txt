This is in many ways a case of history repeating itself.
Think back to 1985 and the Atari St vs Commmodore Amiga war:

Atari had a machine made from off-the-shelf parts, an off-the-shelf
OS (DR DOS + GEM), and MIDI ports. Commodore had a more expensive
machine, with custom hardware, and a Unix-like OS developed in-house.

Now, we are being offered the PIOS ONE, with off-the-shelf hardware,
off-the-shelf OSes (BeOS/P-OS) and MIDI ports. Meanwhile, there is
the A\Box, which is more expensive, with custom hardware, and an
in-house OS based on Unix. SPOOKY!

And we all know who won the war the last time round...

(Doesn't bother me - I am one of those sad beings who hopes
to get both machines!)
