Depends on when you want to start counting from, but here's a 1997
summary:

VIScorp's CEO, Bill Buck, resigned in January.  He has been replaced by
Larry Siegel, who was President of Atari (not sure which division) from
'88-'92.

VIScorp is moving to LA in the next month or two.

That's about it.  SEC filing maniacs will find one from, I believe, late
January of this year, which contains Buck's resignation information, among
other things.
