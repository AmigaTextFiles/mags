Subject ........: Waiting for your MUI keyfile? Read this!  :)

This was rather amusing....

I had registered for MUI way back in Dec. 95.  After waiting 2+ months
for the keyfile to arrive, I complained to Stefan Stunz who promptly
emailed me my keyfile in Feb 96.  Fine, no problem, I was registered and 
the incident was over with.  I forgot about the fact that I had never 
gotten my keyfile from the US distributer for MUI (I can't even remember 
his name anymore).  This is the good part.  Last week my keyfile finally
showed in the mail from the US distributer.  Yes, you read that right,
last week.  So basically, the US distributer takes a about 15 months to 
process your MUI order and send the keyfile.  Anyone who is waiting for 
their keyfile (in the US) might be looking forward to a nice long wait.
