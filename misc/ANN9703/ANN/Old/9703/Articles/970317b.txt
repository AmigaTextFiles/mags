Subject ........: Quasar terminates French Dist. agreement

17th March 1997

For Immediate Public Release:

Quasar Distribution, publishers of PC-Task, DirWork, Quarterback and
Quarterback Tools Deluxe, have terminated our distribution agreement
with France Festival Distribution due to piracy of PC-Task 4.

Due to Serge Hammouche (the owner of France Festival Distribution)
illegally selling pirated copies of PC-Task updates and full packages,
they are no longer authorised to sell any versions of any of our
products.

It is disappointing to us to see this sort of behaviour occurring at
this vital time for the Amiga computer.

New distribution details will be available soon on our web site at
http://www.ozemail.com.au/~pctask

French PC-Task users are able to upgrade directly from us for
US$47 including delivery.  Further details are available on our web site.

All PC-Task versions are sold with printed manuals, with a properly
printed PC-Task label.  If you suspect your version is a pirate copy,
please email us at pctask@ozemail.com.au
