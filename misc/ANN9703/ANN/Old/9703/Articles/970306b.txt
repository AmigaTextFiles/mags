That's true in the strict sense. But I asked before, can any new
machine REALLY be an Amiga? After all, you can buy the name, but you
can't likely rebuild the people or environment that created the Amiga.
In the rest of the world, the effect of the individual is fairly well
ignored, unless your name is Bill Gates or maybe Steve Jobs. But
Amigoids should know better than to assume buying the old technology
necessarily delivers a new Amiga anymore than what PIOS or Phase 5
does. Except, of course, in name.

We're claiming that only the marketplace can name the true Amiga
successor. Part of that formula, IMHO, is that there's an OS easily
recognizable as Amiga-like, and this OS is something any hardware
vendor can license. PIOS had planned to back the New Owners in their
efforts to port AmigaOS to RISC, rather than fragment the market by
doing our own OS. Since that didn't happen, we've chosen to back other
OSs. The pOS hold the best promise for making an instantly recognized
AmigaOS environment on the PowerPC, while the BeOS is the most forward
looking OS around on any CPU, and also very true to the goals of the
AmigaOS, if not pre se an API-compatible implementation of those
ideas. 

>They will have the ultimate decision as to the new direction of Amiga. 

They'll have the decision about The Amiga (TM) and where it goes.
Given that nothing they do will have much impact in 1997, I don't
think any new owner immediately steps in an owns the Amiga market any
longer. Again, the marketplace will crown the new king, or maybe even
elect a congress instead.
