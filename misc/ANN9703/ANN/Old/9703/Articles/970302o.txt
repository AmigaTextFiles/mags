Right -- the need to move fast, to something new, is critical. We saw
this problem years ago at Commodore, which is why RTG was spoken of
for so long. I honestly don't know why it didn't the priority it
deserved. But really, at various points, what work C= did on chips was
always going to be a compromise, simply because C= could only do one
chipset at a time. Should they concentrate on something for the home
market, 90% of sales? Or maybe the video market, the critcial leading
edge and technology driver? But what about the not-insignificant
hacker's market, that demands something like the SVGA they can get
1280x1024 on, only cooler. Once you have RTG, no one has to make the
choice. So sure, if a graphic makes sense, you design it. Having it
would advance the platform, but not having it doesn't drag you down.

I have three PCI systems in my office here (one Pentium and three PPCs
involved in the driving process). I picked PCI as the winner the day I
read the first specs I could get my hands on in 1992, and scrapped
development of my own, fairly similar modular bus. Because of the
volume issue. Zorro III could go faster than EISA, and it could be as
cheap as PCI, IF the volume had been there. But it wasn't, and that's
because no single vendor could command that kind of volume.

VIScorp wanted to build a set top box. Compared to real STBs of last
year, AA was killer. This year, less so, since you can leverage off
more of the 32/64-bit game machine stuff, if not video-enabled SVGA
chips.

Commodore was caught in a downward spiral. They didn't make enough
money to improve the chip FAB, and as the chip FAB aged, it affected
the profits, making less money to put into the chip FAB, etc. Ok, most
of that wound up in Gould and Ali's pockets, anyway, but you get my
drift here. A company like HP with a 0.8um process could make AA or
AAA chips, make a profit, and still deliver them for less than C=
could run them for on their own 1.5um process. If the chips even
worked in-house (Lisa did, none of the AAA chips did).

And Mot's always been a good partner, today more than ever. They're
giving us, in the PPC and support chips, what C= never did -- the
ability to kick the Intel platform in the butt, hard and square, based
on low-level hardware specs alone. Amigas did win on system throughput
as long as Mot was aggressive on the 68K, but it was always a race to
keep up the system. PCs had cache, we couldn't afford it. They had
faster memory buses, DRAM interleave, etc. We couldn't move as fast,
because they had the choice of system chip vendor, so someone was
always ahead. 

Now we have a system that's in all ways superior to the PC, while at
the same time using their best advantages, like cheap I/O chips, for
ourselves. Imagine what Amiga sensibilities on this kind of hardware
are going to do. Life's getting good, even if I only get 2-3 hours
sleep a night.
