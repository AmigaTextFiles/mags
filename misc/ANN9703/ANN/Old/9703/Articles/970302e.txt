Main issue is the different architecture of the CPU module. There are
all the experiences from nearly 10 years of Amiga accelerator boards
gathered, in that you better put the main performance determining
parts like RAM local on this board. So we think we'll have some edge
in system performance, mainly when upgrading to newer CPU modules.
