I was just sitting here pondering the fact that today is the last day of
February and I've not heard anything about the NEW owners of the Amiga. Wasn't
this supposed to be settled by today?

I'm not really sure about conspiracy theories but I'm beginning to wonder if
there are people getting their pockets padded and making a good living keeping
the Amiga tied up in limbo? Sometimes it sure seems like it! :(
