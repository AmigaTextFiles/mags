I have 13 separate audio/music components here in my office, not
counting computers. The modular approach is the right one. I don't
have to replace may amp or mixer just to change to new montiors or a
new DAT deck (as if). 

Same goes with computers. There are two reasons for thiis need. The
first one is that different technologies don't always change at the
same rate. If you can replace just the pieces you want improved, you
ultimately do save money over replacing the whole thing. 

The second thing is user preferances: not everyone wants or needs the
same things. This is a problem we always had at Commodore: what should
a new graphics chipset do? Do you want it video oriented? That's not
going to please CAD or DTP users. The ideal gamer's solution isn't the
same as the guy doing MIDI work. So a modular system is more easily
tailored to your needs. That's not so necessary on the PC, where you
can pretty much find the unit you want if you're not married to one
company. On the Amiga, one model had to be everything to everyone for
awhile. That's also not the case for PowerPC machines. And yet, at
CeBIT, the PIOS One was only one of three CHRP machines being shown.
This, at the world's largest electronics and computer show. That
implies that for some time, the market will more resemble the Amiga's
than the PC's. Also, once you've plunked down your money, you're stuck
with what you have, unless the various pieces are easy to change or
add to.

Computer systems are lots more like my MIDI gear than the audiophile
stuff. There's not all that much change in the audio market. Sure,
trends come and go, but the changes are small, subtile, and on the
high end, expensive. So you don't upgrade. MIDI stuff changes rapidly,
not quite as fast as computer stuff, but close, since it's basically
all digital these days and thus tied to the same rapid growth enabled
by computer technology advances. And for the most part, everything's
perfectly modular; computer, software, synthesizer, mixer, amp,
they're all fully interchangable. That kind of thing never quite
happens in the computer business, though PCI has helped quite a bit in
this respect, by delivering a fast, CPU independent bus that can take
all kinds of different "modules". We're providing the one piece you
can't usually get on a module, the CPU subsystem. Next to graphics,
that's the most likely piece to change in the near future.

There is that. Also, they achieve some stability. There are going to
be a number of successful CHRP companies as long as CHRP is
successful. Most of them won't give Amiga users the time of day, other
than to offer the MacOS and, maybe, the BeOS. It is to the advantage
of Amiga users that an Amiga friendly company have success in the CHRP
machine market, simply because who else is going to cater to them?
PIOS is doing what we can to deliver an Amiga friendly computing
environment, because of our individual love of the Amiga. Maybe this
won't be enough for some, the right answer for others. But it is
something, it's real, it's happening this Spring, and it's the best I
could manage. It's also more than anyone else has managed to date.

Actually, most of Phase V's income come from their Mac PPC upgrade
cards, at least based on the volume they were claiming for those
cards.  That's probably good for them, if they're planning MacOS on
the A\Box, since they'll have name recognition in the MacOS market.

Maybe more, if it's a bad-ass multiprocessor board. But hey, if it's
half the cost, you save 50% over the new motherboard solution. That's
a good deal -- you're not likely to get any value in replicating all
those ports on the new motherboard, they're just the same as those on
the old motherboard, at least for five out of every six upgrades.  And
realize most motherboards don't come with advanced graphics chips on
them. Chances are, such a board would be way more expensive to
upgrade, it simply carries along more of the system.

Yeah, I did the CPU slot idea on the Amiga 2000. Of course, I didn't
invent the idea of adding in CPUs, that was done externally on the
A1000 before I got involved. The A2000 solution was just the way to
get the CPU added within a working system, rather than at the "edge",
as it was on the A1000. 

And sure, it's a different implementation, but these are different
times. Take the $3.00 68000 out of your A2000, live entirely on
boards, and you'll have kind of the 1986 answer to the 1997 question
I'm answering in the PIOS One. The CPU card idea is done this way for
many reasons. It actually saves money in a system as shipped, because
all of the fast stuff is on the CPU card. So the motherboard can be a
cost effective four-layer board, without compromises. The CPU card, on
the other hand, can support the high speed PPC buses very nicely since
it's small, and it doesn't have a slot breaking that bus in two, like
you get on some of the PowerMacs with the old PReP CPU card idea.

"Everything you need" is pretty transient. I upgraded my Amigas all
the time, but via cards. I upgrade my PClone about once a year, more
or less, depending on how much of a part it plays in my real work.
That's been about one motherboard upgrade a year, because there's
usually no other choice. And even at that, other than going from ISA
bus to VL bus to PCI bus, there hasn't been a significant different in
the motherboards, other than the CPU architecture. 

>>So much the better.  We are Amigans, remember?

>So only loyal amigans will buy A\Boxs? :)

Loyal Amigans will not buy Wintel machines except as necessary to make
a living. Anything beyond that is currently up for grabs -- the
marketplace is the only thing that can pick the Amiga's successor or
successors, at least until something happens with the original assets.
And there's really no guarantee anything ever will, they might easily
fall into the wrong hands. I'm not saying my new system is right for
everyone, only a fool would make that assertion. But I do claim the
"good hands" part.

From the end of Commodore I have been asserting that the only healthy
post-Commodore Amiga market can result from multiple hardware vendors
all supporting a common OS. It's really notthing more than the choice
of the OS, right now, being a question, since the AmigaOS port for
real has never happened, and probably will not. If there was one
choice, PIOS wouldn't be supporting four OSs. It would be much easier
just to work on one.

Upgrades are driven by CPU speed and graphics speed. The A\Box might
prevent the graphics upgrade for a generation. It's doing nothing to
prevent the CPU upgrade requirement, and in fact, quite a bit to
enhance this need, such as running on a shared bus, which is never as
fast as running on bus designed to the CPU's needs, rather than
graphics system's needs.

That, unfortunately, isn't the Amiga's market. The idle rich used to
buy Macs. Now they buy fancy laptop PCs.
