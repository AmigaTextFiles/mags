Yup, they did. They paid for only about 50 copies of DiskSalv 4 (which
they called DiskSalvAFS I guess, but I never did). I bugged them to
pay for months, finally pulling their copyright authorization last
fall. They constantly lied to me about it, meanwhile bandmouthing DS4
on the nets and promising their own replacement tool, which as far as
I know was never delivered.

Really. If that's the case, I would STRONGLY urge anyone with DiskSalv
from Forth Level Development to demand a refund. No, you probably
won't get it, but still, I would consider it a personal favor if
anyone who got DiskSalv from FLD would demand a refund. See if you can
get them to FAX you a letter that states they are offering this
refund, or some other statement to this effect. Write the magazines
they advertise in, if they still do. These guys are criminals, and
they have been stealing from the Amiga industry way, way too long. I'm
sorrry I didn't get medeval on them last Summer.
