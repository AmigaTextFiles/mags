A more interesting fact about all this is that QuikPak
still has not paid Silent Paw for the LCD panels they
used in this and the 5050 prototype.  Now if our new
potential owner can't pay off a $3,000 invoice, then
I doubt they can pull off a $10 million dollar one for
the Amiga too.

Seriously though, what has sucked in all of this is
despite repeated calls, faxes, and emails, Mr. Zembecki
has not even returned one message to Shawn or Silent
Paws regarding this outstanding invoice since last
November.  Something to think about.
