Sure, me too, but this is not possible, as the 133 MHz CPU we now use
is already the slowest and cheapest available currently. And we can
imagine that also this will be faded out soon, so that it begins at
200 MHz, at probably the same or a lower price than the 133 MHz one
today. You can't buy this 75 MHz CPU anymore.
