Hello MUI users!

I have recently been getting a lot of inquiries about processor
optimized versions of the MUI libraries. Sorry, I wasn't able to reply
to each of them individually. This article is meant to be a kind of a
"public answer" on this topic.

There are currently *no* optimized versions of MUI for 020, 030, 040 or
060 processors. These versions are planned for a later release as a
special bonus for registered users. Please do not ask me about specific
release dates yet, I really don't know when this will happen. Anyway,
I'll do my best to let it happen quickly.

So again, processor optimized versions are not yet done but will be
available some day. However, they'll only work for registered users. The
public demo will always use plain 68000 code.

I apologize for including the string "generic 68000 version" in the
About window of MUI 3.8. This mistake was probably the cause for the
current confusion about the availability of other releases. Please be
patient.

Let me answer another big part of the questions in my email folder as
well. Due to popular demand, you can now use the secure First Virtual
internet payment system to register MUI online. Please check our web
site at http://www.sasg.com/ for details.

In any case, I hope MUI 3.8 works reasonably well and bug free. If
you've got any problems or suggestions, don't hesitate to ask. You might
also want to participate in the MUI mailing list to discuss current and
future versions. To subscribe, send a mail to
