Subject ........: IBrowse v1.1 released

I just downloaded the new IB 1.02->1.1 patch from HiSoft. It features
Frames, cookies and new internal image decoding modes. I'm posting this
from DejaNews with IB. Since this is the only Amiga browser that supports
cookies, I thought I'd give it a test.

The DN registration went well, so I think this will work.

You can get the patch from:
