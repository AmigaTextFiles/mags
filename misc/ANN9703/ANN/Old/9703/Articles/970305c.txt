Hi,

I just found a notice on the Heise-Site

http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/cm-03.03.97-000/

stating that PIOS will release two systems at the CeBit. One is the
TransAm, which looks like the PiosONE. The other one is called Maxxstreme,
and is supposed to run a ROM-independent MacOS. Is this really another
system, or is this just the PiosONE with MacOS? In this notice, there is
no distinction between the two systems, apart from the OS they run.
But why are there two systems, if it looks like they consist of the same
hardware?

I really would appreciate a clarification from PIOS.

Ciao..

   Clemens
