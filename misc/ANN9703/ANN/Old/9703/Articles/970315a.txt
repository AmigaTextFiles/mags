March 13th, 1997 - Amicrawler.Com announced today the results of a week
long study concerning web browser market share for Amiga computers. Topping
the list was IBrowse, from Omnipresence international, with 68.5% market
share. AWeb ranked a distant second with a 16.1% share, followed by 
AmigaVoyager with a 14.6% share. Older browsers such as AmigaMosaic 
scored .4%, and the non-graphical ALynx scored .3%. Other non-released 
Amiga browsers scored below .01%.

The single most popular release was IBrowse v1.02 with a total count of
7,850 visitors, followed by AmigaVoyager v2.10 (2,557 visitors), 
IBrowse v1.02demo (2,433 visitors), Amiga-AWeb v2.1 (1,967 visitors),
and three more versions of IBrowse scoring over 1,000 visitors. A total
sample of 23,566 visitors were included in this study.

A similar study performed by Browserwatch shows IBrowse with a 95.4%
market share, Amiga-AWeb with a 3% share, and AmigaVoyager with a 1%
share, among graphical Amiga web browsers. This study used a smaller
sample of only 885 visitors over many weeks.
