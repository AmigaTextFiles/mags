Subject ........: Listen up Phase5!!!!

Hi all


I am an Australian Amiga user. A few days ago I asked Sigmacom (Australian 
distributor for Phase5) about getting a CV64/3d and a PowerUp card and to my utter 
amazement and deep disappointment I was told that it was impossible to deal with 
Phase5 and they had practically given up trying to get their products in AUstralia 
(after many attempts at trying). If this is how Phase5 treat their official 
distributor how do they expect to stay in business. It seems to me that Phase5 are 
either incredible ignorant of the Australian market or that they have not yet 
realised the importance of a distribution channel for their products!

I don't know why Amiga users cop this crap but the Amiga tends to make you do this. 
For all the heavy techie talk from Phase5 why do they want to alienate the few 
remaining Amiga users in Oz. I want to develope for their new computer but at this 
rate I might do the unthinkable and leave the Amiga. I don't want to but what 
choice is there in the face of such arrogance.

I know Phase5 read Amiga newsgroups. They were quick to correct technical facts so 
Phase5 listen up...... Why are you showing such arrogance towards your Australian 
distributor. You are all huff and puff, a fake if this situation continues for much 
longer AND you are loosing some of the first adoptees of your new computer. Why? oh 
why????
