After receiving an unjustifiably rude response to this, perhaps I'll 
elaborate...

The A2000 was designed with the Zorro II bus (which we're all agreed, I
think, is slow compared to Zorro III).  It was designed around a 68000 and
a processor expansion slot, which has housed everything from SupraTurbo
68000/28s to 68060/50s.  That's a lot of use out of an 11-year old design.

Phase5 knows a lot more about the A2000 than I do, and a lot more about it
than a lot of other people.  They've decided that it is not a good choice
for PPC.  They made this decision back in 1995, when it was clear there
would not be A2000 PPC cards, so this is hardly a major surprise today.

Their decision is doubtless influenced by the possibility of putting
Caipirinha on the PPC expansion port...perhaps this would not be a
physical or technological fit for the A2000.

The A2000s of the world have had a very good run.  I'm hearing more and
more rumors of 68060/66s coming out.  So there's still life in them.  No,
they won't be getting PPC cards.  But as I say, this is hardly a shock.
