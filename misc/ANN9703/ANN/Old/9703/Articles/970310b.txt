Subject ........: Gateway/Return of the Jedi

Isn't it ironic that the release of the special edition of Return of the
Jedi has been moved to the same weekend as the Gateway Computer Show/Amiga
97 (Return of the Amiga)?

I want to see it.  Want to see it with me, a famous ex-Commodore engineer?

I arrive in St. Louis at 8AM on Friday, March 14th.  Obviously, I'll be
needing to get to the best THX-certified theater in the area for the first
Friday matinee of Return of the Jedi. (I can't see an evening show because
I'll be busy setting up for Amiga97, and also because I don't want the
headaches of those first evening shows.  Besides -- who wants to be the 2nd
to see it?!?)

I assume there may be other people who'd like to get together for the show
and either aren't working or would like to take off work to see the new
movie with a bunch of Amiga fans and celebrities. If so, sound off!

Could someone local help me out?  Ideally, someone can find out which
theater has Jedi in the best format, and would be willing to purchase
tickets in advance for those who agree to pay for them. (And these have to
be purchased as early as the theater allows -- they sell out quickly.) Of
course, someone willing to give me a ride from the airport or hotel to the
theater would be great, too!

I've copied the MO info from www.thx.com below.  Note that only particular
screens are THX certified (so that an 8-plex may have only one certified
screen).  We have to make sure that the particular showing of Jedi we see
is appearing on that screen.  If we have a choice, a 70mm print would be
much better than a 35mm print (are they even doing 70mm prints this time?).
 I'm not sure about the relative merits of the various sound options, but I
think DTS is the better (digital) standard.
