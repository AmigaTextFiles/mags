Actually, there is no NATIVE OS on the PIOS One. We have been involved
with Be the longest, and that's the first system going on the PIOS
One.

I would -- it's no more difficult than the A3000+ system I did in
1991. Easier, actually, since neither the 68K nor the PPC have the
tight latency requirements of the DSP3210. No doubt Phase V has
skilled people here, but really, this kind of thing is a one man
project. Doing a whole new system at the complexity level they're
talking about would take way more people. Never having done this
before will be a problem for them somewhere along the project.

Which they've apparently scrapped for a UNIX kernel. I think you
drastically overestimate the "research" done. All they showed AT was a
port of the Exec running on the 68K.

ProDAD is willing to sell the pOS to anyone who wants it. I don't
think Phase V at any time wanted it. Maybe they'll change their mind
once it's finished. PIOS is supporting pOS because of the fact it's
the most Amiga-like thing we're going to see anytime soon, and because
it's open. No developer is going to write for a system that runs on
10,000 computers, whether they're PIOS machine, Phase V's, or some
others. ProDAD has their own video related tools to port to pOS, and
since they can support the OS on anyone's PowerPC system, they have a
much greater potential target. Same basic reason the BeOS and the
MacOS are viable platforms, whether you like the OS itself or not.

For MacOS, it's simple -- you have to be CHRP compliant, and you have
to get a MacOS license. For the others, you have to port it yourself
today, or wait for them to support CHRP as well. If Phase V is doing
that, then they really don't have much wory about OS support, in time.
Since they're not trying to ship very soon, the software will get
there first.

We had planned to add some of this when doing the AmigaOS port at
Amiga Technologies. The basic thing is, you are inherently losing some
binary compatibility going to a new OS. So you add in what's
necessary, with the old code getting some bits of thunking, emulation,
whatever you want to call it, to fool it about these changes. So you
may never see old apps running protected, but recompiled ones will.
You may also have to fix bugs in the process of the recompile, if they
compromise protection, SMP, VM, or other new features. 

Of course, no one's putting together that 30 man team for the port
anymore. Don't hold your breath, either.

I actually have degrees in both. But I'm doing the hardware, Andy
Finkel is doing the software. He ran the AmigaOS group for many years
at Commodore, he's been working in Amiga stuff probably more than
anyone you can name over these last several years (on the Chinese
Amiga). 

No, we're not building a new OS. Part of the value of experience is
knowing when something is possible, practical, or foolish. Based on
our resources, and the time involved, we did not write a new OS. With
a team of 20-30 experienced Amiga programmers, we could have done a
port of the existing OS in about a year. Without the rights to that
code, it would have taken much, much longer. Look at the BeOS, it's
been about six years, they're prepping for an end-user release in May.
And they didn't have to be Amiga compatible.

That's fine with me. I'm building one computer. Even with modular CPU
and graphics cards, that's never going to be everyone's answer. And we
are looking at being the lowest cost CHRP platform on the market.
That's not where Phase V is going.

No, PIOS supports any graphics card you'd card to use, hardware wise.
Not all of them have software support in every OS yet, sure. Though
there's quite a bit of support for "hot" cards in the BeOS already. If
my favorite isn't supported when I'm ready to finally play with my
PIOS One system a bit, I'll probably writ the drivers myself. No big
deal...

With that said, it's clear that Phase V's system depends on their
wonder chip being in the system. But they did claim that you could run
PCI cards in there too, so it's possible to replace their native stuff
with something faster if you want to. 

>Specs are fun - anyone care to quote the original PIOS ONE specs as opposed

Sure. We found a way to save money, and add SCSI, by replacing an FPGA
with a VLSI chip. Not a profound change, but it significantly improves
the system in many eyes, and saves us money. Now, the PIOS One is
nothing like what we were building at AT, but that's intentional. We
didn't have a zillion dollars to promote something very different at a
$500 pricepoint, nor did we have AmigaOS to run on it (others, like
MacOS or BeOS, wouldn't run on such a machine).

Things change. In this business, fast. I never recommend that anyone
invest in new technology before they're ready. Sometimes even then,
you feel bad, like those guys who bought A2500/30 systems the day
before the A3000 was announced, etc. Hey, by the time the A\Box is
out, we may have other products. Certainly the PPC market will be
different in predictable and unpredictable ways than it is now, or
will be in May. It's always something of a risk, but going to
standards makes it less risky -- you depend on the health of the CHRP
platform market, not specifically the health of PIOS. That's
unfortunately a good lesson to learn from Commodore's exit, something
Apple should have learned well in healithier times for them.
