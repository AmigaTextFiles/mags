Subject ........: Hembach and me

In the same spirit of "Roger and me", I decided to track down info about the
Amiga buyout on my own. On Friday, March 21, 1997 I jumped on the Internet,
grabbed the number for Amiga Tech in Germany and gave them a call in hopes
to get a number for Mr. Hembach. (hey, why not)

The first voice tel number listed for Petro I called reached a fax/modem so
I tried the second number. After a few rings someone (Petro?) answered and
luckily he spoke english. When I asked if he had a number for Mr. Hembach
he asked me why I needed it. I told him I wanted to know the status of the
Amiga buyout. He (Petro?) said that Hembach is on vacation until April 7 and
that he could tell me the status. He went on to say that "they" are several
bidders but that "they" are talking to one bidder in particular and that
it should be finalized in about two weeks. When the deal is done there will
be a press release.I asked if Quikpak is still in the running and he said
he didn't think they were.

My intention is to call back in about two weeks if there hasn't been a deal
made. Just consider this one humble attempt by one Amiga user who just
wants to know what the heck is going on and feels the users have a right to
know.
