Subject ........: New PowerPC chip coming; looks good!

[Note crossposting to Amiga and Mac newsgroups]

I'm reading in the Feb. 17 issue of Microprocessor Report about
the new PowerPC chip code-named "Arthur".  Some online information
about this chip can be found at:

  http://www.mot.com/pub/SPS/PowerPC/library/tech_sum/ISSCC_1.pdf

Basically, the chip will start at 250 Mhz and is expected to be
in systems by midyear.  It should be 90% faster than a 603e and
40% faster than a 604e (integer speed).

  [from MPR:	Arthur:  SPECint95 10.5   SPECfp95 7.7
		603e/240:           5.5            4.0
		604e/225:           9.0            8.5   ]

It has a new L2 cache interface which increases performance by
50% alone.  It apparently allows one to easily add 1MB of 2-way
set associative L2 cache.

In addition, the chip is only 67 mm^2 (vs. 203 mm^2 for Klamath)
and only consumes 5W max (vs. ~25W estimated for Klamath).
(Klamath is the new Pentium Pro with MMX, btw.)  All this while
offering similar performance!

Various tweaks squeeze more performance from this elegant design,
such that it will also compete very well with the Exponential
533 Mhz x704 PPC chip.

The chip may eventually see speeds as high as 350 Mhz.

I see this chip as another ace for the non-Wintel market.  Let's
hope Apple, PIOS, Phase5, etc. all make the best of it!
