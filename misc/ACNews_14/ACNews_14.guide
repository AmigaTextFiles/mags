@{FG Shine}Welcome to AmiChannel News@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 14th issue of AmiChannel News.

I'm afraid that we have lost the last nine months for nothing. It seems that we
are in the same position than one year ago, just after the Cologne'98 show.

If you are connected to the Internet, probably you are aware of the news.
Otherwise, and to make a long history short, I can tell you that Jim Collas has
resigned as president of Amiga. Besides, Amiga left Bill McEwen, the PR guy.
The new president of Amiga is Thomas J. Schmidt, the former COO in Jim Collas
times.

Probably you are wondering why Jim Collas has left Amiga. Officialy, he has
resigned to pursue "personal interests". Unofficialy, something happend at
Amiga/Gateway. Or Gateway didn't like the Jim Collas plans or someone at Amiga
forced Jim to leave.

For whatever reason it was, Amiga has changed one more time its future plans.
The AmigaNG (aka Amiga Multimedia Convergence Computer) machine has been dumped
and there is not going to be a version of the Amiga Operating Environment for
computers. The new plan is to develop user interfaces which will be run under
other OSs.

What's that mean? Gateway is going to build the new set-top-box/game console
developed by Microsoft. So, the plan is to build something for the dreaded
Internet appliances under Windows CE. In short, Gateway has killed the Amiga.

The future of the Amiga community is uncertain. We are going to jump to another
ship, this is for sure, whatever computer it will be: PC, Mac, ... or AQUA.

Our last chance is under the community hands. Fleecy Moss and other Amiga
developers (Phase 5, ACT, Olaf Barthel, Carl Sansenrath, ...) has formed a new
consortium under the name of "Phoenix". The plan is to build a new platform, who
knows if it would be possible to use the Amiga name. I hope that this become
a reality because we know that the strong point of Fleecy projects is not that
they become true. Knock on wood.

I only know that I am missing Jim. He was the leadership/hero we needed and he
is not now with us. Jim, if you read this, thanks a lot for giving us a hope.
Sadly, Gateway has killed it.

@node not06 "AMOZILLAX STATUS AND NEWS REPORT - 28/7/99"

                   AMOZILLAX STATUS AND NEWS REPORT - 28/7/99
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Its been a while since we last made any sort of status report. I feel that we
should now tell you all how we are getting on.

Firstly, we would just like to say that we are still very much commited to
bringing Netscape to the Amiga, and we haven't given up. However, due to many
problems we have encountered recently, including university, exams, lack of
coders, other commitments and so on, we are behind schedule and have missed most
of our deadlines.

The hype surrounding this product was far too early, and in my opinion and would
have been much more suited just before we actually had something to release.

One our goals was to provide a much more competitive and lively atmosphere in
the Amiga Browser scene and we very much hope that we have suceeded. The state
of the Amiga Browser scene is very good, especially with the number of browsers
growing steadily with aMozilla, Voyager 3, iBrowse 2, AWeb, iProbe and Dry Ice.

Depending on the layout engine, we hope to have an early beta version out within
the next couple of weeks. We cannot yet say what features this is likely to
incorporate as it all depends on how various things go.

The first release will incorporate the initial releases of our Network, Layout
and Image decoding libraries and the full developer documentation will be
released. In acccordance with the Netscape Public Licence (NPL and MPL) all
sources that originated from the Mozilla source tree will be made available from
our website (www.freeamiga.org).

We are expecting to have a full release somewhen in the fourth quarter of this
year. This release will have most, if not all of all the features we are
planning on implementing. Details of these will be made available. This list is
getting more impressive by the day...

I would also like to ask for anyone who is willing to help us in our efforts to
contact me (ian@freeamiga.org). We are looking for coders, people to design a
brand new splash screen and transfer and people to help write help documents.

We hope to start a weekly update on the progress of aMozilla so everyone can see
how we're getting on and how close we are to fufilling our targets. This will be
available from our website soon.

Finally, we would like to clarify the exact spelling of aMozillaX... (Its got a
small 'a' :-)

Thank you,
Ian Parker

           OPERATION: COUNTERSTIKE CANCELLED - SIBERIAN SUN ANNOUNCED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

....surely not this soon! Yes, BlueBlack Solution will continue to work on
bringing you the best real-time strategy war game available for the Amiga. Enter
SIBERIAN SUN. This game has been in the works for a couple of months now but
kept under wraps until we where certain about Sadeness. Many of the routines
from Operation: Counterstrike have been replaced with new, faster, more
efficient ones. There are a host of new features which come as standard with
SIBERIAN SUN that won't/aren't available for any other RTS game on the Amiga.
Features such as:

   - AGA and CyberGraphX support in a range of screen sizes
   - Full screen, rendered cut-scenes for the beginning, success and failure of
     each mission
   - Sound Panning, Master Volume Control, Surround Sound (*)
   - Position Dependant Volume (PDV) Effects (*)
   - Optimised Routines for 040 and 060
   - Workbench Window Support
   - Various Weather Effects such as Snow, Rain and Fog
   - VERY Fast c2p routines for AGA machines, optimised for 040/060
   - Custom animation format supporting sounds for individual frames, these
     sounds incorporate surround sound and panning effects as featured in the
     game (*)

Features marked with an asterix require a full installation of AHI with the
relevent sound mode selected. It hasn't been decided yet but the game could be
made to support only AHI, either through a dedicated sound card or via good old
Paula.

Although the game will be playable on a 030 AGA machine (in low resolution only)
it's highly recommended that players have a graphics card and a 040/40 or
higher.

Look out for a presentation of the game to be featured on a future Amiga Format
CoverCD. Although the intro screens will have you believe it's Operation:
Counterstike, the graphics featured are actually from SIBERIAN SUN. There should
also be a CDDA track on the CD to go along with the presentation. Hope you enjoy
it.

More news should be available really soon, along with some more screenshots,
music and a demo.

                             DELSYD SOFTWARE UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're still alive!

Has it really been 4 months since the last update.Wow! We are pleased to
announce that Delsyd Software is moving to a page without annoying pop up
windows! Thanks to the genius of Chris Payne,we will soon be moving in to our
new web space. Chris is doing a total redesign for the site as well. Hurrah!

More games to come

In our relentless quest to push the envelope of Amiga gaming, we'd like to
announce that at least 2 more games are in their early design stages. Both of
them are fairly tasteless. The first game, "Pimpin' Ain't Easy", is a resource
management game where you get to play as a pimp. iDarik Brown is working on this
masterpiece. As soon as we get in contact with him again,we'll give you the full
details. The other game doesn't have a name yet. It's a Syndicate-like game
about gang warfare. Expect both of these games to contain enormous amounts of
senseless violence, tongue in cheek humor, and a total disregard of morality.
Release dates have not been set.

We support the Linux decision

Fair enough. We don't see any problems with Amiga's choice of Linux as their
operating system. We will still fully support the Ng. If the AmiRage and Iwin
systems materialize, we'll support them as well.

                    DIGITAL IMAGES ANNOUNCES SABRINA OFFLINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Digital Images are pleased to announce our first game for the Amiga MCC;
"Sabrina Offline"

Based on Characters from the excellent Eric W. Schwartz comic strip "Sabrina
Online" Sabrina Offline is a 3D Platform Game unlike any other.

Technology-wise, Sabrina Offline will be great, however we're not going to focus
solely on the quality of the graphics engine, the Programmers will - that's
their job. The Designers' lives, however, currently revolve around ensuring that
the game is as fresh, as fun, as exciting and as true to the comic and it's
creator as possible.

Balancing the gameplay is possibly the most important aspect of ensuring this
game earns the 'Best Game Ever' tag we're aiming for. The integrity of the
Characters is sacrosanct, Sabrina's role in this game isn't coincidental, the
essence of the comic will permeate the game as much as is possible without
sacrificing the playability.

As soon as we started to design Sabrina Offline, we began learning about the
restrictions of working with licensed characters. Eric hasn't imposed any
restrictions on us himself, but as Eric fans we are insisting that we don't
insult other fans of Sabrina Online by twisting the characters to fit our game.

Crossing media is difficult to do well, but we believe that this game will make
a suitable companion to the comic.

To do this, we are approaching the game as if it is an Episode of the Comic, in
which Sabrina and some of her friends meet Digital Images and we put them into a
game.

We felt that this was the only way to avoid the hackneyed
getting-sucked-through-the-screen-then-deciding-to-jump-on-creatures'-heads
style "plot"

Because the game acknowledges the fact that the Characters on the screen aren't
the "real" ones (the "real" ones are watching you play and making comments), we
have been able to implement ideas that wouldn't have fit comfortably otherwise.

Deciding how Sabrina is to destroy her enemies was difficult, and we
experimented with several different methods, before eventually choosing Lasers.
All violence within the game will be cartoony, there will be no gore and you
won't see Amy take her dying breath whilst lying in a pool of her own blood or
anything like that.

Six of the Characters are Playable: Sabrina, Amy, Thomas, Tabitha, Carli and
Spike, and each one brings her or her own special abilities to the game. There
is a Seventh Character, Sheila (who hasn't yet appeared in the Comic), however
she is an NPC.

We are doing away with most of the dusty old conventions of videogaming and
replacing them with the next set of ideas that will get ripped off by brainless
Developers who won't do anything unless someone else has done it first. This
includes an exciting new SECRET Level Structure that, to our knowledge, has
never been implemented (or perhaps even thought of) before.

Another convention we've chucked is the one whereby the Designers come up with a
few ideas and then repeat them throughout the entire game. In Sabrina Offline,
we will be implementing new ideas, characters and monsters with every Level Set,
you'll want to complete each Level just to see what we do next.

Trust us when we say you'll never have played a game like this before...

@node not12 "EPIC ANNOUNCES BERTIE'S ANIMAL KINGDOM"

                     EPIC ANNOUNCES BERTIE'S ANIMAL KINGDOM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is "Bertie's Animal Kingdom" ?

Bertie's Animal Kingdom is an Animal recognition game designed for nursery, and
pre-school children. The only requirement is that the child must have a basic
knowledge of how to use a mouse. Keyboard controls are not required, except to
enter the childs name for the hiscore table. All actions which the child does
highlight different areas of the screen in a bright colour so that they know
what they are doing if they click the mouse button on that spot.

For some younger children it may be advisable for a parent to stay with them and
monitor their progress or to help them with reading etc... All main text in the
game is displayed in a large vivid white font.

In the game the child is helped along by a cartoon character called "Bertie". He
gives them a task to perform, tells them what to do, and when the task is
complete he tells them how well they did. Each question answered correctly will
award them 1-3 gold stars which are shown at all times in the top left of the
screen. This is to encourage them to beat this score with each new attempt.

The difficulty settings

There are 3 difficulty settings which either the child can select or you can
instead. You can only choose one at the beginning of a new game. Easy, Normal,
and Hard. On Easy setting (recommended for first time players) the child will
have 5 lives and given a second chance if they make a mistake on one of the
questions - all the questions are multiple choice with either 3 or 4 possible
answers. On Normal settings, they are given 4 lives, and on Hard they are given
only 3 (and no second chance for the Hard setting).

As an incentive to choose a harder setting, the number of gold stars which
Bertie awards for each correctly answered question increase. 1 for Easy, 2 for
Normal, and 3 for Hard.

Don't worry - all the information in these sections, are displayed on screen in
an easily identifiable and simplified way.

The Games

Bertie's Animal Kingdom has many games. They are split into two halves. One set
of games is for Farmyard animals, and the other is for Wild Animals. It is
generally thought that the Farmyard animals are easier than the Wild ones. It is
possible for the child to choose to play a game from either category, but as the
games get more difficult they must be played in order.

Each game consists of 8 questions, based around the following themes: "Animal
Names", "Animal Sounds", "Animal Habitats", and "Animal Foods". There are 2
bonus games which are not part of these, which are simply a way to help the
child with what they have learnt so far.

The Animals

Each Question is based on a different animal, which is displayed in large
colourful pictures in the centre of the screen. Bertie will ask a question such
as "Ben likes to eat...?" and there will be 3 or 4 possible responses displayed
on the bottom of the screen. All the child needs to do is to move the mouse
pointer so that the one they think is right is lit up in blue, and click the
mouse.

A standard tick sign, or a cross will then inform the child whether they are
right or not. Most of the questions are also sentence builders as well, for
example if the child clicked on the picture of grass. The sentence would say
"Ben likes to eat grass." This helps them with basic writing skills as as well.

The sounds

As well as a nice jingle for a correct answer, and a sad jingle for a wrong one,
Bertie himself will speak. The sounds are not complex, and are appropriate for
the child to recognise when they are right or wrong.

The high score table

Each time a game is over, (when the child has run out of lives or completed the
last game) they have a chance to enter their name into the hiscore table, so
long as they have more gold stars than the bottom position. This is saved to
disk and can be viewed again when the computer is reset. The hiscore table
provides a way for different children to compare their scores, or for the same
child to see how they did on previous attempts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperion is pleased to announce that it has bought the Amiga rights for the
final installment in Team 17's cult Worms-series.

"Worms: Armageddon" will be released for Amiga classic (68060 and PPC/WarpOs)
and Amiga NG. The Amiga classic version will require a graphics-board (AGA
version under review) and will support soundcards through AHI.

Worms: Armageddon should be available on CD around the end of the year.

"We did not intend to go public with this for quite some time", says Ben
Hermans, managing partner of Hyperion. "Recent rumours surrounding an Amiga NG
version have however left us little choice. In actual fact, negotiations with UK
based Team 17 started several months ago and were finalised some weeks prior to
the WoA. We certainly hope Amiga users will appreciate the chance to play the
final installment in the Worms-series, which started out so many years ago on
the Amiga. We will continue to deliver on our promise to bring high-quality
titles to the Amiga Classic."

                                 LAMBDA UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm sure many of you feared this would happen. I'm also quite sure many of you
even expected it to happen sooner or later. Well, now it has happened - Lambda
development has been moved to PC. I can finally break the limitations of 060 AGA
and work in a more up-to-date manner. Hell, I could even break the limitations
of current Amiga PPC and 3D hardware and write Lambda solely for the equivalent
of a modern(ish) PC. But that would make no sense, since the PC market is simply
enormous with space games dozens of times better than Lambda appearing every now
and then. This is why I am still planning to target the Amiga, namely the PPC
equipped with 3D hardware. Software rendering is still going to be supported,
but it will not be the primary concern anymore.

Some of the changes we are planning to make include dumping the 256 colour
limitation. The new engine will be truecolour based. AGA should be supported
through dithering the internal 16 bit images into a static 256 colour
all-purpose palette, which will of course look worse than before, but is better
than nothing. Standard graphics boards will get real 16 bit rendered graphics,
and 3D hardware will be supported through Warp3D.

Among the utopistic features of the new engine are fully coloured directional,
point source, and ambient lighting, and better special effects. I am also
considering optional bump-mapping (for 3D chips that can do or fake it: ViRGE
and Permedia 2 most probably cannot even fake it, but Voodoo 1 can, although it
needs two rendering passes). On the audio side I'm planning to support 3D
sounds, although on the Amiga these will be reduced to normal panned sounds with
surround encoding.

With this much changes about to be made I guess the already very long
development time will extend to near-eternity. I estimate Amiga NG will have
been around for quite a while before even a new demo version can be released...

If you wanted a normal industrially manufactured game, you were barking the
wrong tree. Lambda is an experiment. One that has even gone wrong a few times...

     MUSHROOM SOFTWARE PURCHASES F1 SOFTWARE AND 5TH DIMENSION LICENSEWARE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier this month, Mushroom Software has been in negotiations with Phil
Wilkinson to purchase F1 Software, and all it's other Amiga pieces, including
5th Dimension Licenseware. Now that most of the smaller and technical details
have been taken care of, I can make this announcement to the public.

Now that I own the companies, I will be making a lot of changes to the way it is
operated. I will be adding a lot more titles to the collection, as well as some
good quality utilities. The collections have been weak in the past when it came
to utilities, and I also hope to start adding some internet software to it's
collection very very soon. I also want to sell a lot more titles online, and I
want to encourage my other distributors to do the same. So far, I have
experimented with eBay and found the response quite surprizing. Visit our
webpage for a link to our online auctions, where you will be able to pick up
some great software titles.

At this time, I will be keeping the existing F1 distributors around the world.
There will be at least 1 new distributor set up within the next few weeks in the
UK, but I will give more information on that when everything has been taken care
of on this end.

As I said above, I will be looking for new titles to add to the collection. If
you have a game or utility that you have been writing, and would like to earn
some serious cash, then feel free to contact me at the above email address for
more information. Author's do not have to live in just the USA, I hope to
recruit more programmers from around the world.

The Mushroom Software homepages will now become the official home for F1
Software, and I strongly urge all of you to bookmark www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk
and take a look at some of the games available. Every game sold gives the
programmer a large royalty, and our prices are not high compared to some of the
other titles available on the Amiga market, which the programmers will most
likely benefit from a lot less.

If anyone has any questions or comments, please feel free to email me at
mushypd@redrose.net. If you would like to get a free Amiga catalogue with some
demo software, please visit www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk/freecat.html. Thank-you for
your patience.

              EPIC TO PUBLISH ALL FUTURE PAGAN GAMES DEVELOPMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pagan Games and Epic Marketing are happy to announce a long term co-operation.
This co-operation means that Epic Marketing will publish all Pagan Games
developed in the next couple of years.

Says Vince Pike of Epic: "This will be a strong co-operation where both partners
can concentrate on what they are doing best: Pagan Games can concentrate on
delivering top quality games and Epic on the Marketing aspect. We look at this
as a very strong partnership which will deliver high quality products to the
Amiga community."

Jason Hayman of Pagan Games, one of the co-founders of the Pagan Group adds:
"Our partnership with Epic allows us a stable and supported base for future
development of all Pagan Games in the next 3 years. We see this as a long term
deal with Epic with a very promising future for us both. We are the largest
development group on the Amiga with over 20 members working on 3 projects - and
we are still hiring more!"

The first product to be released will be the Amiga title "Dafel:Bloodline" an
action based RPG game. "Dafel:Bloodline" has an isometric 3D POV, similar to the
"Chaos Engine" series and comes with a sound system called Full Sensual Gaming
(FSG) which will be responsible for the best possible atmosphere ever in a
computer RPG game. The features of "Dafel:Bloodline" are:

   - Extremely fast chunky to player (c2p) graphics engine - RTG compatible: The
     game offers two resolutions to play in, 320x240 and 640x480. Both sizes
     offer 256 colours on screen with the 640x480 version requiring a graphics
     card and fast processor to run. The AGA version runs at 25fps. Both screen
     resolutions are RTG compatible working on CyberGFX and Picasso96 systems.

   - FSG Audio System (Full Sensual Gaming) & CD Music/Effects: We use our own
     stereo sound handling system in the game. Using either Paula (or possibly
     AHI) we split the available channels in half assigning 1 pair to what we
     call Sound Objects (SO) and the other pair to Environment Sound Objects
     (ESO). SO's are used to create objects that can be tracked by sound alone.
     Using advanced algorithms, the volume level of the sound is calculated in
     real time so the closer you are, the louder the SO will be heard and the
     further away you are, the quieter the SO will be heard.

     In relation to the SO, the ESO's (Environment Sound Objects) are used to
     add atmosphere and ambience to a level. In conjunction to background sound
     effects being played off the CD, ESO's are used to add an extra dimension
     to the audio set by trigger points on the game map.

   - Game Engine: We have mixed two gaming elements together, action and
     adventure, into one engine. The action elements consist of Dafel attacking
     level enemies and end of level monsters. There are 3 ways Dafel can attack
     using his sword. The first basic way is call a "low swing" This is where
     the player simply taps the fire button and Dafel performs a small swing
     with little damage but allows a consistent flow of attacks. The second is
     a "medium swing" caused by a 2 second hold on the fire button, where Dafel
     sweeps the sword around at waist level to attack, this allows more damage
     but takes up more time to allow enemies to counter attack. The final is a
     "full swing" where Dafel slashes down from over his head, a 3.5 second
     hold. This inflicts the most damage but is very time consuming and allows
     enemies even more time to counter attack.

     The adventure and strategic elements arise from the solving of puzzles, the
     communication with other characters and the well being of Dafel himself.

     Throughout the game there are sub-plots that are relevant to the core plot.
     Dafel must find and complete these to progress through the core plot. The
     game has been designed in a non-linear fashion allowing the player to
     revisit areas and solve puzzles in any order. There are however, key plot
     stages that need to be completed before progressing to another
     sub-plot/task. These key stages are always followed by a cut-scene to
     develop the plot further.

     Dafel must also live in this world and to do so he must maintain his armour
     and sword and also feed and drink himself. Strategic elements arise in this
     management role of looking after his equipment and hunting for food. Dafel
     can also visit blacksmiths to maintain his armour and sword and also shops
     to buy provisions. In nearly every village/town that Dafel visits, there
     will be a building from where Dafel can undertake non-plot tasks to earn
     money and skill.

   - Enemy Artificial Intelligence: Enemies that roam Dafel's world can behave
     in 3 different ways. We have "roamers" who aimless wonder through the maps
     attacking at will. We have "ambushers" who can lay in wait then attack and
     we also have "group attackers" who only fight in groups. The 3 Super
     Classes are then sub-divided into various attributes such as sight,
     hearing, smell and intelligence. An enemy with low sight for example would
     reply upon smell and haring alone to locate its enemy. We also have
     attributes for courage to determine how long an enemy will attack before
     they flee.

   - Manga Style FMV and Cut Scenes: Bloodline begins with a 5 minute FMV
     sequence based upon the Prologue. It is also ended by an FMV sequence.

The finished product can be expected at around the time of the Cologne
exhibition. A playable demo will be released in a couple of weeks. Preorders can
already be placed with Epic Marketing UK (Tel:01793/432176, E-Mail:
epicmarketing@dialin.net) or Epic Marketing Germany (Tel:07071/400492, E-Mail:
info@epic-marketing.de) for a special preorder price.

"Dafel:Bloodline" will probably remain the only product that will still support
the Classic 68k based Amiga. The next project "Scavengers" an action based but
still strategic game in complete 3D which will combine the best of Wing
Commander and Command&Conquer into a new game, is scheduled for release on Amiga
MCC and might also be developed for Amiga PPC and 3D graphic boards if there is
enough demand for it.

currently working on can be found at these webpages:

Product information:

GREat Effects Development proudly presents version 3 of PFS. After PFS2 was a
big success in the Amiga community, you are now able to get the new enhanced
PFS3 with useful additional features and tools. Once you've installed PFS,
you'll never miss your old FFS.

New features of PFS3:

   - PFS Doctor, a repair program
   - User definable deldir now up to 992 entries!
   - Extra long filenames, up to 100 characters (optional)
   - Improved long term performance
   - HDInsttools for easy installation
   - Our own format command for PFS
   - Several bugfixes

All this was already offered by PFS2:

   - 68000, 68020, 68040 and 68060 versions.
   - superior performance. Up-to 500% improvement over FFS.
   - disk are always valid. No more 'validating disk'!
   - reliability
   - concurrent access without performance loss. PFS2 handles simultaneous
     accesses very well!
   - easy file-recovery with the delete directory. Getting a deleted file back
     never was so easy.
   - automatically truncated logfiles. Get rid of those ever growing logfiles.
   - Build-in interface for live optimiser. There is no optimiser yet, but this
     interface makes it possible to optimise the disk without taking it
     off-line. When the disk is accessed during optimisation, PFS2 will stop
     the optimiser, which can continue afterwards. A dormant optimiser can even
     be automatically notified when the system is idle, making optimisation
     completely transparent.
   - improved testing procedures making PFS2 more stable and reliable then ever
     before.
   - enhanced documentation including programming docs (disk structure and
     special packets).
   - new versions of all supplied tools (bug-fixes mostly), pfsls, diskvalid
     etc.
   - fully Ami-FileSafe compatible.
   - early problem detection mechanism. The early problem detection mechanism
     detects problems with your disk before it is too late, ensuring optimal
     protection of your data.
   - extended disk structure to make disk-repair easier.
   - Partitions upto 104GB and harddisks upto 2TB utilizing TD64 and DirectSCSI
     support.

                      THE WORLD FOUNDRY NEWS : AUGUST 1999
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TWF Update

   - There is a small article about Explorer 2260 and Maim & Mangle in the
     September issue of Amiga Format.
   - Two banner ads for E2260 and Maim & Mangle have been appearing in recent
     weeks on the Amiga Central website (www.amigacentral.com) on some of their
     pages. Let us know what you think of them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explorer 2260 Update

Sorry folks, there are more delays coding wise for E2260. As mentioned last
month, this really can't be helped I'm afraid. :( As for how it will affect
release schedules, it's hard to say at the minute. Programming on E2260 should
recommence later this month.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maim & Mangle Update

Development is flying along very nicely for M&M with a lot of coding being done
by Massimiliano. Here is some of the work that has been done this past month:

     Engine:
      - gouraud shading on the terrain, user can choose between none, flat and
        gouraud shading.
      - the units now follow the flow of the 3D terrain.
      - 2 new zoom factors added.
      - fixed various bugs.
      - improved zsort routine on the terrain.
      - general speedup (about 40%).
      - new shading routine for buildings.
      - cpu version on par with w3d version (almost).
      - 060 version on par with PPC version (no asm routine yet).
      - the camera follow the terrain height.
      - explosions added to the engine.

        A *lot* of work on our internal tools/editors (9 new releases)

     Graphics:
      - Several more units/buildings have been modelled.
      - A lot of work has gone into landscape textures and the 3D terrains.
      - We have selected Peder Lundberg as our new GFX artist.

     Porting:
        Research is being done into the possible porting of M&M to other systems
        (particularly Linux and AmigaNG platforms) on completion of the Amiga
        classic version.

     Screenshots:
        There are 4 new screenshots on the M&M section of our website. Don't
        expect big explosions and firefights just yet but it shows a variety of
        textures, the lovely gourand shading and some of the different zoom
        factors. All these screenshots have been grabbed from a computer with
        full PPC & Warp3D support, so if you don't have either, don't expect it
        to look as well.

     Game Background:
        For those interested in the game setting, it's now in the M&M section of
        the website.

@node not21 "OPEN LETTER ABOUT POWERPC DEVELOPMENT"

                     OPEN LETTER ABOUT POWERPC DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the last weeks there was a lot of confusion on the Amiga Market. We saw the
Phase 5 announcements concerning their G3 Board and Amirage. We saw the WOA with
the announcements from Amiga. And we are seeing the OS3.5 Development since
quite some time.

In the light of these confusing events it is time for clarifying our position
(see below who is "we"

We certainly hope Phase 5 will support WarpOS and Warp3D or will work with H&P
to allow WarpOS/Warp3D to support these upcoming G3 boards and Cybervision NG
cards. Our software relies heavily on Warp3D of which no PPC library version
exists or is even possible. We make extensive use of functionality only WarpOS
provides. Also our projects are in the meanwhile too much advanced to change
something this major like the used PowerPC Kernel, both out of commercial and
technical reasons.

Moreover, it should be remembered that WarpOS was endorsed by Amiga as the
official PPC kernel. In short: for economic and technical reasons we cannot
justify developing a ppc.library version of any of the below mentioned titles or
even future titles. Additionally it is very important for us that the WarpUP
Software will be available at the same time as the new hardware. The Amiga
cannot withstand another market split. We also hope that Phase 5 and H&P will
clear up the confusion with a joint announcement soon.

We:

   - Hyperion (Shogo, Heretic II, Worms: Armageddon, WarpFX)
   - Digital Images (Wipeout 2097 and other future projects)
   - The World Foundry (Explorer 2260, M&M, and other future projects)
   - Darkage Software (Supreme Effects Generator)
   - Colin Ward (WarpMAME)
   - Markus Poelman
   - Steffen Haeuser (WarpSNES, WarpHexen, WarpHeretic, FrodoPPC, Warped!)
   - Hellcoder

                           AHI/PPC DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Martin Blom, author of the RTA system "AHI", has updated the AHI/PPC development
page with some more info.

The PPC assembler mixing routines are much faster than the C version, although
it is possible there is still plenty of room for improvements. It's also stable
now, which means that a berta version could be released in a couple of days.

This is an "incomplet and incorrekt" list of what's left to be done (until the
final version of AHI/PPC is released, that is):

   - Add PPC assembler mixing routines for 16 bit samples.
   - Add m68k assembler mixing routines (8 and 16 bit).
   - Add WarpUp support (partly done).
   - Martin might consider adding non-hifi mixing routines when the new mixing
     code has stabilized.

The first issue will have to be resolved before the beta is released.

                     WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID ABOUT JIM COLLAS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Aram Iskenderian" <arami@ix.netcom.com>

These words were posted on team Amiga mailing list, I think the owner wouldn't
mind I post them here in public.

Carl Sassenrath:

     "Of all the people at the Amiga helm in my 17 year history with it, I had
     the highest respect and admiration for Jim Collas. Although it is known
     that I did not agree with Amiga's latest choice of OS direction, Collas
     was top in my book. I wish him and Bill all the best."

Dave Haynie:

     "I was fully prepared to bust Jim's chops when he called me on the
     Linux/Java stuff. But he was fully on top of it all, agreed where a poser
     wouldn't have, and did convince me, at least, that they had a shot at
     delivering some real innovation. I'm not easily sold on any of that, and
     while I doth protest to this day about Linux, he at least gave reason to
     still be interested in the goings on at AmigaNG."

Dan Dodge:

     "I liked and respected Jim. Although he took Amiga in a direction away from
     QNX he had vision and passion in what he did. Maybe our paths will cross
     again under better circumstances."

                    AMISSL AND HTTPRESUME 1.7 NOW AVALAIBLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Andrija Antonijevic" <TheAntony@bigfoot.com>

There's a new SSL package for Amiga available from my homepage at
www.bigfoot.com/~TheAntony/AmiSSL

Here are its features:

   - Full SSL support as shared libraries package on Amiga (something like
     MiamiSSL).
   - Based on OpenSSL 0.9.4 which many things use (Apache SSL and mod-ssl,
     Voyager, IBrowse). This means that these things can get ported/recompiled
     to use AmiSSL pretty easy.
   - It should work with any AmiTCP alike TCP/IP stack (AmiTCP, Genesis,
     Miami...)
   - Has international (which uses RSA) and USA/Canada version (which uses
     RSARef package from RSADSI).
   - It has most used ciphers/message digests as shared libraries with freely
     available developer material. This means that, for example, AmTelnet could
     use IDEA, DES, Blowfish and other ciphers from AmiSSL for SSH thus saving
     (quite) a bit of memory. Another example is Amiga version of PGP which
     could use ciphers from AmiSSL.
   - It has versions optimized for different processors. (PPC version for
     PowerUp boards is possible if someone would be kind enough to volunteer to
     be my guinea p... I mean, do some tests for me O:))
   - Ciphers can be easily left out of it. For example, you can just replace
     rc4.library with dummy version of it, and everything still works. No need
     for patching the main library to add/remove ciphers.
   - Includes port of openssl program (named amissl) which does lots of things
     including any kind of certificate manipulation, encrypting, decrypting,
     producing message digests...

On the other hand, HTTPResume v1.7 is out with a few new features including
HTTPS support using MiamiSSL or AmiSSL. Available from my homepage now or from
Aminet in a few days.

                 DIGITAL IMAGES SUSPENDS ALL AMIGAMCC PROJECTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Stuart Walker" <info@digital-images.demon.co.uk>

To Amiga users worldwide,

Due to recent announcements and problems with Amiga, Digital Images regrets that
we will be suspending all AmigaMCC projects including Sabrina Offline. Space
Station 3000 and Wipeout 2097 will be released as planned, but we will be
suspending all other Amiga developments until further notice.

Everyone behind Digital Images has enthusiastically supported the Amiga through
the good times and the bad times. But with the recent troubles with Amiga, the
entire team has unanimously decided to suspend all Amiga developments (with the
exception of Space Station 3000 and Wipeout 2097). We regret to have to take
these measures, but Digital Images cannot afford to spend time, resources and
money developing for a computer which now, as it seems may never appear.

We hope that everybody reading this understands our position as this is the last
thing that any of us would ever have wanted to do, but Amiga have made promise
after promise that something would appear, but it has not.

We deeply regret this decision, but it is a final measure that has to be taken.
We wish that we wouldn't have to go this far, but we now have no other option -
it is the last thing that any of us wanted to do. We would appreciate it if
everybody understood our position and wouldn't send e-mails of anger and abuse.
We have done everything in our power to avoid this, but it just isn't possible.

If the Amiga does indeed rise again, which we hope it does, we will return.

We hope that you will enjoy our upcoming releases of Space Station 3000 and
Wipeout 2097.

If you do have any questions or queries concerning this announcement, please
e-mail info@digital-images.demon.co.uk

We thank you all once again for your loyal and devoted support.

Kind Regards,

Stuart Walker
Digital Images

18 Aug 99: Amiga "No Piracy" Campaign

     Piracy copies harms the existence of Amiga companies more and more.
     Especially in the case of applications and games this causes that new
     projects will not be proceeded any more. It is high time to start a joint
     action... www.haage-partner.com/actions/nopiracy-e.htm

28 July 99: World of Amiga in London

     The years WOA was again well-attended not least because of the excellent
     location (Kensington Town Hall) and the good organizations. We presented
     the current beta version of AmigaOS 3.5 several times per day on the
     VidiWall. After the show we even had enough time for a walk through the
     center of London :)

     In August and September there are more Amiga shows scheduled in Australia,
     USA, Slovenia, Finland, Italy, Canada, Portugal.

28 July 99: Tornado3D v3.0

     Eyelight plans to release Version 3.0 on 14. September 1999. Those who buy

              DAVE HAYNIE'S OPINION ABOUT JIM COLLAS LEAVING AMIGA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Dave Haynie"

Sad to see more melodrama around the Amiga.

Clearly, there's a curse of some kind on the Amiga Technology, or at least the
name (it's unclear what Gateway's actually doing here).

Jim called me a short time after their Linux announcement, after I posted a list
of fatal multimedia flaws in Linux on an Amiga news list. He seemed quite
knowledgeable and willing to listen. And very set on introducing a new
Amiga-labelled machine that would, somehow, address the multimedia issues. This,
he insisted, by December.

And yet, he didn't sound wrong, at least based on the technology discussed. Much
of what he claimed was possible, and only possible, based on some very specific
system design issues (won't get into that here in detail). Without the proper
system, as in the original Amiga, it just wouldn't fly.

Why did he leave? I'm sure many theories will come up. My favorite at the moment
-- Applesque infighting within the ranks of the new Amiga company. There are
some rumors around the Amiga Community that flatly contradict much of what
Collas told me, and positing a much later ship date. Could just be rumors, could
also be that, in a sense, both were correct at the time, and since that can't be
sustained, his direction lost. Maybe we'll know soon (though Gateway is
traditionally tight lipped), maybe it'll be yet another sad mystery in this long
and angst-ridden tale...

@node not29 "LAMBDA DEVELOPMENT UPDATE"

                           LAMBDA DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only a month after I switched to PC I had to give up the Apollo 1260 turbo I
once borrowed from a friend for my Amiga 1200. That Amiga is now back to being
equipped with my trusty old Blizzard 1230-IV with 8 MB RAM. Practically this
means the complete end of my Amiga developments. I'll still be able to compile
Amiga stuff using a cross compiler though, once I bother to install one.

Development on the new virtual machine has finally started. Things are still on
the drawing board after an unsuccessful attempt at writing some test code first.
Most likely the virtual machine will be similar to Java and UnrealScript with
some things left out and others brought in. It is my intention to integrate the
virtual machine to the core library, so it can be used in projects other than
Lambda as well. "What other projects!?" I hear you ask. Well, when developing
something this big, it would be foolish not to make it as reusable as possible.
If things go very well, I might actually finish Lambda one day and be able to
start another project.

Any graphics or game engine development is still halted until the core library
and the virtual machine are up and running. I do have plans to support many
different levels of graphics output abstraction, including plain software
rendering, hardware assisted rasterization, and full T&L (transformation and
lighting) abstraction. This results in a scalable system which can support
simple Amiga graphics boards and things like NVidia geForce256 alike. Of course
it is the content, not the engine, which will ultimately decide whether a game
runs quickly on standard Amiga graphics boards or takes the most out of
geForce256...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explorer 2260 Update

Another quiet month for E2260. Only a little work has been which includes the
following:

   - More background work, specifically hyperspace and storyline related.
   - Audio / CD player code fixed and completed.
   - Texture import system redesigned.

More work should be done in September.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maim & Mangle Update

A good amount of work was done in August even with Massimiliano taking a well
deserved holiday. These include:

   - Game Coding:

      - changed our internal data organisation
      - added explosions anims
      - allowed textures repeatitions
      - few bugs fixes
      - started coding first AI routines, including collision detections
      - a lot of work on our internal editor tools

     In September work will be done on the AI and adding a few more features to
     the engine.

   - Porting:

        Work to be started on porting the game to another OS.

   - Screenshots:

        4 new screenshots were added to the TWF M&M section and received a lot
        of positive responses to them. Must have been the explosions. :)

        There will also be a special M&M preview with 4 or 5 previously not seen
        screenshots in the first issue of Amiga Active out at the end of
        September.

   - M&M Discussion Mail List

        The discussion mail list was setup in august and has provided some good
        ideas (some of which we'll add to the game). If you would like to
        contribute some ideas for the game, you can join the list by sending a

                     FINAL VIRTUAL GRAND PRIX DEMO RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last demo of Virtual Grand Prix, formerly known as "AlienF1" has been
released. When you read this the game should be released and worldwide published
by Epic Marketing under their "Islona Entertainment" logo (check the
www.epic-marketing.de site).

Virtual Grand Prix is a fast 3d tmapped formula car racing game for AGA/GfxBoard
Amigas develped by Paolo "The Alien" Cattani. The full version of the game
features:

   - all the 16 circuits of the 1998 season - only 3 tracks available in the
     demo version.
   - championship mode - only single race mode available in the demo version.
   - telemetry - unavailable in the demo.
   - 3d rendered animations with 14bit-quality soundtrack - unavailable in the
     demo.
   - digitized speech - unavailable in the demo.

Apart from the above, this demo has all the driving helps turned on by default,
so that it's by default in its "easy" mode (you can, of course, turn the helps
off to feel the realism of the simulation)

Enjoy it and, if you like, buy it ;)

               FIRST LETTER OF TOM SCHMIDT TO THE AMIGA COMMUNITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wanted to make sure everyone knew that Jim Collas has chosen to leave Amiga to
pursue other interests and opportunities. I would like to personally thank Jim
for the leadership and vision he brought to Amiga and the entire Amiga community
over the past eight months. We wish him the best of luck in his new endeavors.

I have been with Amiga since April of this year as the Chief Operating Officer
and I continue to be extremely excited about the plans and strategies we have
been working very hard on the past several months. Those plans will continue
with a great business and technology leadership team focused on the emerging
Internet Appliance market space. As we finalize our plans in this area, we will
communicate those to the community.

I would also like to thank Bill McEwen for his many contributions to the Amiga
community and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. Bill has been a
steady and calming voice to the community.

Regards,

Thomas J. Schmidt

1. Introduction

AmTelnet II is a client for the Internet "Telnet" and "SSH" protocols for
remotely logging into computers, playing text-oriented multi-user games ("MUD"s
or "MUSH"s) or manually simulating internet protocols.

2. Note for registered AmTelnet 1.x users

AmTelnet II requires new keyfiles. However, the upgrade for registered AmTelnet
1.x users is *FREE*. New keyfiles have been mailed out to all existing AmTelnet
1.x users to the e-mail addresses on which they originally received their
keyfiles.

Should you, for some reason, not have received your AmTelnet II keyfile yet,
please mail your current AmTelnet keyfile together with a short note on *WHERE*
and *WHEN* you originally registered to <keyfile-update@vapor.com>. Please note
that those requests have to be manually processed by a poor overworked software
developer (me), and thus they generally have awkward response times -- sorry for
that.

Please note that NetConnect II users are not entitled for an free AmTelnet II
upgrade. AmTelnet II may be part of the general NetConnect III upgrade, however,
please contact Active Technologies for any relevant information on the
NetConnect package issues.

3. Bug reporting

Please mail bug reports and enhancement suggestions to

     <amtelnet-bugs@vapor.com>

Any reportes submitted this way are automatically entered into the VaporWare bug
tracking system. Please see

     bugs.vapor.com

on more information on how to access the bug tracking system.

4. Documentation

As the time of writing, AmTelnet II totally lacks any documentation. Any
volunteers on that are greatly appreciated :)

       TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TELEPHONE GREETING PETRO MADE TO THE SAKU 99
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a transcription of the telephone greeting Petro made to the
Saku 99 Amiga Show in Finland in September 1999.

I have tried to make this as readable as possible, but without taking any
liberties with the context of his speech. Keep in mind that - while Petro's
english is good - this is an address made over a telephone and recorded off a
speaker in a crowded room.

I have tried to lose all of the 'ums', 'ahs' and 'ands' and connect a few
unconnected sentences. Where the quality of the recording was such that a word
or phrase was unintelligible (including audience coughing, etc), I have tried to
indicate this with a (?).

Otherwise this is an accurate account of what Petro said.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello?

Hi everybody. How are you doing today? I'm really a little bit sad that I could
not come to see all (?) Amiga this year.

But first, the latest news which was announced over C/Net and over the Gateway
Internet two days ago. My boss, Jim Collas, left the company and I'm, of course,
very sad about this. Because I am thinking that he was a guy that could drive
our Amiga in the right direction for our future.

But nevertheless the lines (?) are continuing as you know, and I'm famous for
this - that I will never give up. So don't worry. Nobody will attack me, nobody
will fire me, we should cool down. I will leave Germany in around two hours to
go to the United States. I will have Sunday night already the first dinner with
the new president, which is Tom Schmidt, and then I will know, of course, a lot
more than today when I'm getting all the facts and how it will be continued.

Because, dear Amigans, we will have a future. We will have a bright future. And
some things happen. Especially the US companies and I remember when I worked for
Commodore there was always a lot of going and coming. Nevertheless, we have to
keep what's going on.

I'm really sad, not only because Jim Collas is gone, I'm also sad because I
could not fly to Finland as last year, which was really great for me. I was
really excited to go and see you and to give all these giveaways personally,
from my bag to your hand. But I know that Janne (one of the organisers of the
Saku show - CD), who is really an excellent organiser, will assist me, will give
all the presents which I brought which I sent to him. I hope also that the
demonstration of the OS3.5 will work proper and you will enjoy and you will see
that we are really serious with everything.

The OS3.5 will be ready for sale end of September and we are now in plan. As you
know, we have had a little bit of delay. Officially we would like to announce
the OS3.5 in Canberra, what we have done, but not with a final version but with
a pre-release. But that's okay.

Now we are in planning and sales will start end of September, for sure.

I'm also quite sure that the new development on the MCC will continue. Maybe
there will be a delay, I don't know. But I will let you know as soon as I'm
back. This will be next week, on Thursday, and I'm quite sure that when I talk
with my US colleagues that we can also put an announcement - an official
announcement - on our web site, and we can start then also communication.

So I can promise you, what I can do for Amiga I will continue to do. I need your
support, also for the future and I hope to see you soon, maybe the next big
convention (which) is in Cologne, as you may know, on the 14th and 15th of
November and I will be glad to see some Finnish guests there.

So thank you very much for your attention, thank you very much for your
understanding, and I only can repeat myself - please, do not panic. We will
survive. Thank you.

(applause)

                      BLIZZARD AND CYBERSTORM BOARDS GO G4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update on the Next Generation G3 Product for the AMIGA from phase 5 digital
products

TOP NEWS 02.09.99: Join the exclusive club of GigaFLOPS users now - with the
Next Generation PowerPC G4 processor boards from phase 5 digital products!

Faster than expected just five weeks ago, Motorola's new PowerPC G4 (XPC7400)
processor powerhorse is now shipping! We have therefore immediately decided to
make this brand-new technology available to all Amiga 1200/3000/4000 users, by
shipping all of our upcoming next generation CYBERSTORM and BLIZZARD boards with
these new high-performance G4 CPUs !

Because of that, only with our new products series

   - Your Amiga will get the most up-to-date CPU which was ever available in an
     Amiga, including any upgrade processor boards
   - Your Amiga will offer a processing performance which is superior to nearly
     any available personal computer system today - supercomputer performance
     on your desktop! Plus even the option for symmetrical Multi-Processing
     with Dual-XPC7400 modules for those who need the real bang....
   - Your Amiga is technologically up-to-date - with powerful hardware,
     expansion options and the support of highly modern Operating Systems
     including backwards compatibility to the Amiga OS 3.x.

Please also take a look on the updated product specifications below, as well as
on Motorola's website www.mot.com/SPS/PowerPC/!

For all Amiga users, who now finally decide to buy a next generation CYBERSTORM
or BLIZZARD G4 board, we have extended the preoder program with significant
discounts one last time until October 15, 1999. Don't miss that final deadline!
You can find the link to the order page on the bottom of this page.

IMPORTANT: If you have already ordered a G3 board, you do not have to place a
new order or act. All customers, who have ordered a 400MHz G3 version in the
preorder program, will receive a 400MHz G4 version of the CYBERSTORM or BLIZZARD
G4 board at no extra cost. Customers of a 300MHz G3 version will receive a
separate notification from us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR NEWS ABOUT THE SOFTWARE OF THE CYBERSTORM AND BLIZZARD G4 BOARDS - August
04, 99:

After entering a cooperation agreement with QNX Software Systems Ltd., we are
able to ship the new CYBERSTORM and BLIZZARD G4 boards with the outstanding
operating system QNX Neutrino. As we - together with QSSL - will also make this
OS available to all users of existing first-generation, 603 and 604 based
PowerUP boards for free, it will be supported by a large number of current Amiga
developers very soon, and will be the operating system of choice for several
future stand-alone hardware products (from different vendors); thus, the
CYBERSTORM and BLIZZARD G4 boards with QNX Neutrino OS open up the path to the
future. The compatibility with existing applications under AmigaOS 3.x will be
maintained by the powerful AmigaOS Legacy Support. With this open and innovative
approach, which will also be choosen and supported by other vendors, the
CYBERSTORM and BLIZZARD G4 boards play a leading role in the introduction of a
next-generation series of systems and computers of different vendors, among them
our own AMIRAGE® K2 computer system.

WHAT DO THESE CHANGES MEAN FOR THE USERS?
It's simple: They bring you more performance, more functionality, and more
future - and all that for an even lower price as earlier announced! The
CYBERSTORM and BLIZZARD G4 boards provide the perfect start for all developers
and users into the next technology generation!

Additionally, the CYBERSTORM and BLIZZARD G4 boards are open systems, which can
also be used with different other software solutions. The integrated Flash-ROM
offers a boot select menu, from which different system software kernels can be
started from the Flash-ROM or from boot partitions on your hard disk (several
different boot kernels can be installed parallely). The programming of the
Flash-ROM as well as the other hardware functionality is documented, and this is
available to developers. That means it is easily possible to install and run
other software solutions (such as Warpup or Linux) without using or starting
from the QNX Neutrino OS which comes along with the boards.

UPDATES ON THE HARDWARE CONCEPT - August 04, 99:

A major change of the design of both boards is that we have decided not to
integrate SCSI and IEEE-1394 on the products as standard, and therefore reduce
the base prices of the products (we will make add-ons available, and have also
added other features, as you can read below). We have decided to do this, as we
found out that many customers have very different demands. For example, many
have been asking for implementation of the U2W SCSI interface ® even for the
BLIZZARD G4 board ® which is more expensive and would later also cause
significant additional cost to the user in respect to cabling and adaptors. On
the other hand, other customers may only want to connect some older legacy SCSI
devices and would be happy with a cheap 8-Bit SCSI port. Some other may not need
SCSI at all, but want to pay the lowest possible price for the step into the G4
generation. Consequently, we have decided to offer base boards without
specialized I/O functionality, but with the option for customized
configurations.

The good news is, that the CYBERSTORM G4 as well as the BLIZZARD G4 will both
have PCI slots already on board, which will allow to connect PCI add-ons
directly. In order to make the boards fit into the same Amiga systems as the
earlier CYBERSTORM PPC and BLIZZARD 603 boards, we will be using Mini-PCI
connectors, on which PCI modules in the new Mini-PCI standard can be installed.
This design allows the users to connect Mini-PCI add-on cards directly to the
CYBERSTORM G4 as well as the BLIZZARD G4, without the need to spend money for a
PCI bus expansion or to worry about mechanical integration of such a board.
Developers, as well, can easily use either common Mini-PCI cards and write
drivers for those, or quickly design new Mini-PCI cards with standard PCI chips.

Another change is the usage of standard SO-DIMMs (SDRAM) as they can be found on
modern notebooks, which also allow to design the boards in very compact form
factors, thus making the CYBERSTORM G4 fit into all A3000 and A4000 desktop and
tower models (with fully installed memory and Mini-PCI cards), and make the
BLIZZARD G4 fit into most A1200 tower cases on the market and in use. IMPORTANT
NOTE: These modules are available at similar prices compared to the standard
SDRAM DIMMs, as theya are used in many computers such as notebooks or Apple's
iMac.

As an integrated standard I/O port, the CYBERSTORM G4 as well as the BLIZZARD G4
will also have two USB ports to connect to a rapidly growing number of
inexpensive expansion devices.

EXPANSION OPTIONS - August 04, 99:

phase 5 digital products will also be offering some cost-effective MiniPCI
add-on modules. We have a number of options which add-on boards for I/O purposes
may be developed by us, and which will be quickly realized depending on the
actual demand. It may be noted that these options include those functions which
were originally considered to be on-board, and are now simply moved to an
optional MiniPCI card. The currently planned, optionally available modules
include:

   - An U2W SCSI controller w/ internal 68pin port and active termination, for a
     net retail price of EURO 150 or US$160

   - An Ultra SCSI controller w/ internal 50pin port and active termination, for
     a net retail price of EURO 80 or US$90

   - An Ultra-DMA IDE/ATA controller 66MHz with 2 ports (to support 4 devices)
     for a net retail price of EURO 80 or US$90

   - An IEEE-1394 Controller with 2 ports at 400Mbps, for a net retail price of
     EURO 100 or US$110

For any of these modules, a minimum order quantity of 250 units must be reached,
in order to justify the software and hardware realization. If for any of these
modules this quantity can not be reached, we will inform all customers who have
ordered this option. Customers can now - in the updated ordering form - order
these boards to be shipped with their BLIZZARD G4 or CYBERSTORM G4 board.

GFX OPTIONS - August 04, 99:

phase 5 digital products will also offer a next-generation gfx board for the new
accelerators. This new board, the CyberVisionNG, is currently planned to

   - incorporate a blazing fast 2D/3D graphics chip, with a powerful 128bit 3D
     engine

   - feature a maximum resolution of 1920x1200x32 @ 72Hz

   - offer full video acceleration to support full-screen, full-frame DVD
     playback

and will be priced at EURO 180 or US$ 190 with 32 MB of local memory (net retail
price based on the memory prices of July 1999).

With the large amount of local memory for display and textures, it will provide
highest performance and impressive 3D capabilities which have not been available
on the Amiga ever before, at a most attractive price point very close to that of
common PC products.

          PETRO TYSCHTSCHENKO SPOKE TO SAKU 99 AUDIENCE VIA TELEPHONE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

ESPOO, FINLAND - September 5, 1999 - The biggest Amiga event in Finland, Saku
99, was held yesterday and turned out to be success, even though Petro
Tyschtschenko of Amiga had cancelled his visit a couple of days earlier. The
show was visited by approximately 400-600 people during the day.

Although Mr. Tyschtschenko couldn't attend in person, he spoke briefly at the
show via telephone. He apologized for not coming and asked the audience not to
panic. Mr. Tyschtschenko also said that he is not going to be fired and that he
will meet with the new president shortly. AmigaOS 3.5 will be released by the
end of September and the MCC is still on track, although it could be delayed a
bit. He also mentioned the up-coming Cologne show and hoped too see some of the
audience there. The speech will soon be available in MP3 format.

Saku 99 was organized and sponsored by the Finnish Amiga Users Group. The show
was also generously supported by Amiga, who donated two Amiga A1200's for a
raffle and gave away literally dozens of AmiColas, Amiga Theme CDs, card games,
mouses, mouse pads, socks, pens and other promotional items. Haage & Partner, in
co-operation with Amiga, provided an AmigaOS 3.5 pre release for demonstration.

Warm thanks also to the Finnish exhibitors Amigator, Gentle Eye Ky, Elysée Arena
and Petsoff LP for making Saku 99 a truly memorable event. In addition to the
companies mentioned above, special thanks to Broadline Oy, ClickBOOM, Digital
Dreams Entertainment, Toysoft and Tsunami Trading for supporting the user group
with prize donations and product samples, some of which were given away at the
Saku 99.

Above all, the Finnish Amiga Users Group would like to thank the hard working
Amiga users who have volunteered their time, passion, talent and even financial
support for making this spectacular event happen. A list of these individuals
will be published in the next Saku e-zine. There could never have been an event
like Saku 99 without the tremendeous support of the Finnish Amiga community.

                         STFAX 4.0 TO BE RELEASED SOON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STFax 4 was written with the intention of creating a centralised communications
tool for the consumer and SOHO market. The main intention of STFax 4 is to offer
advanced features, yet retain ease of use, supporting a number of different
communication mediums, such as fax, voice, data, and, later, email and GSM/SMS.

STFax 4 offers scalability, adapting to the home user needing a simple
answer/fax machine replacement, through to a company requiring automated fax and
voice message distribution across small network of computers.

Enhanced flexibility also enables a travelling businessman to install onto his
notebook, running under UAE, connect his GSM phone and send/receive a fax,
receive/reply/send an SMS message, write/send/receive email or even remotely
access the local STFax 4, situated within the office.

General Features

STFax is a multi-purpose voice/fax/data communications package. Replacing
several dedicated devices, STFax is a phone, answer-machine, facsimile, mini-BBS
and communications server.

Automatic call detection. Distinguish between incoming voice, fax and data
calls. Any server can be 'voice, fax and data', 'fax only', 'voice only', 'data
only' and so on. If set to 'voice and fax', STFax will initially answer in voice
mode, switching to fax mode if the call is an incoming fax.

Remote access. STFax allows full remote access by any account holder. Call STFax
on any server which contains a 'Remote Access' command within a script, enter
your account ID, followed by the password and choose from three options:

   - Playback of new voice messages. STFax will inform the caller of the number
     of new voice messages contained with this account and start to playback
     messages one by one. The caller would have the option to skip, replay or
     delete the voice message.
   - Forwarding of new fax documents. STFax would inform the caller of the
     number of new fax documents, ask for the number to forward these
     documents, would hangup, prepare and then forward the documents to the
     specified remote fax machine. This option is ideal for users who are often
     work outside the office (as a consultant, or similar), are unsure of the
     remote fax number and wishes to forward all documents, from their account,
     to a remote number.
   - Re-recording of greeting message. A remote caller can call STFax and change
     their menu greeting (this is the initial greeting a caller would hear when
     the server answers the incoming call). STFax would play the greeting, ask
     if the caller wishes to re-record, and would then re-record. The user
     would again have the option to replay or re-record this new greeting.

Standard interface. STFax was designed to be suitable for both the consumer and
small or home business market. The interface, based on a tried and tested
design, was created to be powerful, user-friendly and unintrusive.

Supports an unlimited number of accounts/boxes. Each user can have their own
account/box, password protected and containing a number of different options:
auto-forwarding, auto-printing, notification and more.

Distinctive ring (modem dependent). Distinctive ring 'splits' one phone line
with multiple phone numbers. A line can have upto four different numbers, per
phone line. Each of these numbers plays back a different ring tone - STFax can
determine the number dialed, by the ring tone.

As an example, a small or home business could split one line, with two different
phone numbers, to perform two different tasks. Some examples include:

  1. Business and personal. In some areas of the country BT are unable to offer
     more than one phone line per household. In this case, the user would be
     able to use the one phone line, with two numbers - one for personal calls
     and one for business.

     STFax could be used during the day to differentiate between these two
     calls. Indeed, STFax could play a 'Sorry, we are currently unavailable,
     Please leave a message after the tone' message, for the personal number,
     but allow the caller to answer the business line.

     After business hours, the opposite would apply. STFax could play 'Sorry, we
     are open between the hours of 9am and 6pm, Monday to Friday. Please leave a
     message after the tone' but would ignore calls to the personal line. So, if
     a call came into the personal number, after 6pm, STFax would let the call
     ring (perhaps for x number of rings), allowing the user to answer the call
     manually, via their telephone handset.

  2. Sales and support. A user would be able to advertise two different numbers
     (one for sales, one for support), and answer the call, with a different
     greeting or script, depending on the number called. STFax could be used to
     warn the user of an incoming sales or support call.

     The added advantage of this system is that if the user is answering one of
     the numbers (ie. support), both numbers appear 'engaged' to another
     caller. This is ideal for the small or home business who often have one
     staff member - a consultant or similar.

     If the user had to pay a visit to a client, they could leave STFax to
     answer the support number with a greeting, but any calls made to sales
     would be transferred to his mobile phone.

  3. Phone and fax. A user would be able to advertise two numbers (one for voice
     calls and another as a fax only number), again using one phone line. A call
     comes into the voice number, STFax would ignore it (unless it is set up to
     answer after x rings, automatically). A call comes into the fax number;
     STFax would answer, in fax mode, without delay.

     Again, if the user leaves the office, calls made to the phone number could
     be transferred to his mobile phone, whilst STFax answers fax calls in fax
     mode.

  4. Phone and fax on demand. STFax could be setup, as described above, to
     ignore the call if it is an incoming voice call (to the voice number).
     However, a user could set up another number as a fax on demand system. A
     user calls this number, is greeted by the fax on demand system and can
     quickly choose the required fax documents.

  5. Phone and Mini-BBS. A user could use one of the available phone numbers to
     run a support bulletin board system. A home-based graphic artist would be
     able to answer calls made to the voice number and the mini-BBS would
     automatically answer any calls made to the BBS, enabling clients to
     download or send files to the local server.

There are a number of interesting actions that can be applied to distinctive
ring. The function is ideal for the small or home business who are limited by
the number of phone lines they can have installed (ie. you can often only have
two lines per house, as standard).

STFax supports BT's 'Call Sign' (distinctive ring, but with only two ring type
options).

Call logging. The log file stores the number, time and date of each call. Stored
Caller ID information allows you to reply to a stored call or add the number to
either the phonebook or the 'call screening' preferences, allowing you to
quickly add new contacts.

Over 60 pre-recorded professional system greetings. STFax ships with more than
sixty professionally recorded 'classic' English greeting and system messages.
These can be re-recorded by the user or the user can choose to add further
greetings. Your account greeting might be personalised, to suit your own
requirements or preferences.

Independent Operation Mode support. STFax supports the Independent Operational
Mode as found within the PACE 'Solo' , 3-Com Message Plus (and Pro), and Kortex
Adaptix modems.

Independent Operation Mode allows you to use the modem as a digital answer and
fax machine without the need for your PC to be switched on. The modem will
answer with a greeting, the caller can leave a message as per a normal answer
machine and, if they are sending a fax, the modem will switch into fax mode and
receive the fax. The voice and fax messages are then stored on the modem and,
the next time you run your PC and STFax, these messages are automatically
downloaded to your software. You are then able to play/view/print/delete the
messages.

STFax supports the advanced Independent Operation Mode features found only
within the PACE 'Solo' modem. For instance you can remotely retrieve your
messages, you can use the 'follow me' option to call you on your mobile and play
important messages.

Auto-warn. Automatically warn a user of an incoming call. Different techniques
can be applied:

  1. Default warning - plays 'incoming call', looped, to the user. The looped
     warning stops as soon as the call is answered.

  2. Default warning & Caller ID - plays 'incoming call' and the caller id,
     where available. For example, a call from 01325 460116 would result in
     'incoming call... 0-1-3-2-5-4-6-0-1-1-6'.

  3. Caller ID only - plays back the caller id, where available.

  4. Custom sample - play a custom sound sample. This could be an individual
     sample, per server, or a general sample, played across all servers. As an
     example a user could have 'ringing1.wav' for server.1 and 'ringing2.wav'
     for server.2.

Caller ID notification. Where a modem supports UK Caller Identification (Caller
ID or CID), this information will be shown within the server window. If the
number is listed within the phonebook, the name of the caller and any stored
notes about the caller, will also be displayed.

STFax supports BT's 'Caller Display' (UK Caller ID).

Facsimile Features

Fax from any Amiga application. Simply choose the 'STFax' driver from the list
of printers. STFax then intercepts the printed document allowing you to send,
schedule or store the new fax message. You are also able to attach text or image
files to the fax in order to create additional pages.

Send fax messages from any class 1, 2 or v2.0 modem, even via your mobile phone
(using additional drivers).

Scan and fax directly from ScanFax. Scan single or multiple pages into STFax and
send as a fax message.

Perform immediate, scheduled or store fax documents. Create your fax message
then choose to send immediately, store for future access or schedule at a
specified time.

Broadcast your fax to multiple recipients. Send a fax message to one or more
recipients, either immediately or scheduled.

Add quick cover pages to your outgoing fax messages. Adds an A5 cover page to
outgoing faxes. Broadcast fax messages will obtain information from the
phonebook, where possible. For instance, the cover page will obtain the name,
company, phone number and fax number, inserting this information into the cover
page for every user that is selected from the phonebook. This results in a
custom cover page for every fax broadcast to however many selected users.

Advanced fax on demand system. Run from within a script or standalone. Callers
are able to request one or more fax documents, receiving them locally or to be
sent to a remote fax machine.

Auto-printing of incoming fax messages. STFax can be set up to automatically
print all fax messages that are filtered into a specific account. Each account
can print to any available printer. For instance a fax received within the
'Mark' account could be printed on the printer nearest to Mark, over a network.

Auto-forwarding of incoming fax messages. STFax can be set up to automatically
forward all faxes received by a specific account (or all incoming faxes). For
instance, if Mark was out of the office, he could have all his faxes forwarded
to the remote location.

Automated replies. An option to automatically reply to all received fax messages
or specific fax messages/callers. For instance, if a fax message is left by
'John Smith', and a fax filter recognises the remote id, an automated reply
could be sent which says 'Hey John, I am currently away on vacation for the next
two weeks. Your fax was forwarded to Paul who should reply within the next two
days. I'll call you as soon as I return. Regards, Chris'.

Automated replies could be setup to reply to every, general fax message, where
remote id exists. For instance, a reply that states 'The office is closed during
the next few days due to a change of address, we'll get back to you as soon as
possible. If you need us urgently, call Sue on her mobile: 07879 1234567'.

Advanced fax viewer. Scale fax pages, rotate, invert, clipboard mark and save
and more.

Remote access to store fax messages. Any user can call STFax, enter their
account ID (and password), connect to their account, check the number of new fax
messages and then enter a number to fax forward these messages.

Advanced fax filtering. Filter incoming faxes based on 'remote id', 'caller id'
or 'keywords' (OCR keyword searches - STFax will look for specific references
within the fax. For instance a fax with 'FAO Mark' could be transferred to
Mark's account). STFax can perform actions based on received and filtered faxes:

  1. Print to [any selected printer]. This option would print to any available
     printer. If a user has a specific printer, STFax could be made to print to
     this printer.

  2. Forward to [remote fax number]. Forward/transfer to an external fax
     machine. Useful for receiving important fax messages.

  3. Move to [selected box]. Move the fax to a specific account. For instance,
     if STFax recognises 'Mark' within the fax, the fax will be transferred to
     the 'Mark' account.

Fax filtering supports more than one rule. A user can choose to forward a fax to
a remote user as well as moving that same fax to a specific account.

Fax filtering is especially useful for specific or important faxes. For
instance, if a user was waiting for a fax from 'Chris Wiles', and was out of the
office, he could set up a fax filter to check for the keywords of 'Chris' and/or
'Wiles' (or even remote id). This, and only this, fax would then be forwarded to
a specified fax machine.

Voice Features

Use your modem as a hands-free telephone. STFax is able to use your modem
speakerphone and microphone to hold a conversation with a caller.

Advanced tree structure voice scripting. Users can create advanced tree scripts
allowing various options, depending on key pressed.

A number of commands are included:

  1. Menu - the opening menu, the other branches link from this. For instance
     the menu could say something like 'Press 1 to be transferred to an
     operator, press 2 to leave a message or press 3 for our fax on demand
     system').

  2. Greeting only - a simple greeting is played. For instance 'Sorry, we are
     now closed for the weekend, please call again on Monday'.

  3. Greeting and record - a simply greeting is played, allowing a caller to
     leave a message after the tone. For instance 'Sorry, we are now closed for
     the weekend. Please leave a message after the tone, or call again on
     Monday'.

  4. Choose box - choose a correspondent. For instance 'Press 1 to leave a
     message for Sue, press 2 to leave a message for Mark or press 3 to leave a
     message for Chris'.

  5. Remote access - enter the remote access system. Allows a remote caller to
     check new voice messages (play, replay, delete), forward fax messages and
     change their account greeting.

  6. Transfer caller (modem dependent) - transfers a caller via internal PBX or
     to an external number (using three-way call).

  7. Call operator - tries to contact an available operator.

  8. Fax on demand - enters the fax on demand system.

There are also a number of sub-commands for each main command. STFax will, for
example, always 'listen' for the star key, which returns a caller to the
previous branch. If a caller entered the 'choose box' section and decided they
wanted to route to an operator instead, they could press star to move back to
the main menu.

Automatic dialing from the phonebook. Dial a contacts phone or mobile phone
number.

Message playback. Playback your messages via the modem speakerphone, phone
handset or internal audio (sound card).

Call screening. By using Caller ID (CID), STFax can be made to perform various
actions. A number of commands are available:

  1. Use custom greeting. Using Caller ID, a user can 'assign' personalised
     greetings to particular caller. An example:

     'Mike half-heartedly asked his girlfriend to dinner that evening but wanted
     to confirm by telephone. He phones her, she's not at home, but her sister
     informs Mike that she will call when she returns.

     Damn, he's got to go out and meet someone and can't wait for the call. Mike
     records her a personal greeting, 'Lisa, I had to rush out. Can we meet at
     Giovanni's around 7.30pm this evening? Leave me a message if there is a
     problem, if not I'll meet you at the restaurant'.

     Lisa arrives home, hears the message but realises she won't be able to make
     it for 7.30pm, so calls Mike and returns the message 'Hi Mike, can't make
     7.30pm, but I'll meet you there before 8pm'.

     Obviously Mike is not at home, but he can get to hear this message. He
     calls from a phonebox after his meeting, remotely accessing his voicebox,
     hears the message and makes his way to the restaurant for 8pm.'

     In this example, Lisa is the only person who hears the personalised
     greeting. If someone else called before or after Lisa, they would have
     heard a standard greeting such as 'Sorry, I am currently unavailable.
     Leave me a message and I'll get back to you', or something similar.

  2. Warn user. By using call priority you can also set priorities to callers,
     using their Caller ID. Busy, but don't want to miss an important number?
     Maybe you are a freelance journalist needing to meet an important
     deadline, but daren't ignore every call in case the editor phones! Well,
     assign a priority to the editor's phone number and when he calls STFax
     would warn you of this incoming call and only this call. All other calls
     would be routed to a general greeting such as 'I am not available at the
     moment, leave a message and I will get back to you soon'.

  3. Play custom script. STFax can even execute a complete advanced tree script,
     based on an incoming call. For instance, you might want to offer the
     incoming caller a number of different options. Perhaps you want to offer
     established customers more of a personalised service? Well, instead of
     being greeting with the usual menu greeting (press 1 for... press 2 for...
     press 3 for...) a customised script, routing them to shorter set of options
     could be made available.

     Perhaps the caller never does anything but contact a certain member of your
     staff? Quickly route that caller to that staff member, but offer them the
     chance to move back to the main menu greeting, as an option.

     A custom script could also be used to quickly transfer a caller to an
     external number or at least offer this service to specific customers.

  4. Ignore call. By using Caller ID you can set a blacklist of numbers which
     you want to ignore, or be auto-answered. Tired of salesmen? Sick of
     constant nagging from the mother-in-law? Put their phone number in the
     blacklist!

     Number 'WITHHELD', 'UNAVAILABLE' and 'INTERNATIONAL' calls can also be
     blacklisted or you can have STFax perform actions on these numbers. Very
     few people call friends and deliberately withhold their phone number, but
     a lot of sales people making cold calls use 'WITHHELD', so you aren't
     aware of who is making/made the call.

  5. Answer in operator mode. STFax will immediately notify the operator that a
     call is incoming and allow them to answer in operator mode - or put the
     caller on hold, transfer the caller or even ignore the caller.

  6. Execute command line. STFax will execute an external program or command
     line. Could be useful for starting your contact database or similar.

     Once the command has been executed, STFax will continue to answer as
     normal.

     Call transfers using hook-flash (modem dependent). STFax is able to
     transfer calls internally (PBX) or externally (via three-way calling, ie.
     to a cellular phone). This serves a number of purposes. Some examples
     include:
      - Callers can be greeted with a message that asks them to press '1 for
        sales, 2 for support...'. Pressing '1' would route a user to the sales
        department or a sales operator, via PBX.

      - Callers can enter a correspondent's account where they are immediately
        transferred to an external phone number (for instance if Mark was out
        of the office any callers wanting to talk to Mark could be transferred
        to his mobile phone).

      - Callers can be requested to enter the extension of the correspondent
        they require (ie. '4102') and STFax will route the caller to that
        operator, via PBX.

STFax supports BT's 'Featureline' (Centrex) and similar PBX systems.

Data Features

Mini-BBS. As STFax differentiates between voice/fax/data calls, you could
quickly route an incoming data call to STFax's internal mini-BBS.

The mini-BBS allows any user to upload files to open or secret doors, list files
available (from the download file list) and choose one or more for downloading,
change doors (ie. protected and secret doors may be available) or message a
user.

Three examples where a mini-BBS would be useful:

  1. A graphic design company could use the mini-BBS to allow clients to upload
     files inside and outside of office hours. Indeed, by using 'doors' within
     the BBS, a client would be able to upload to specific accounts. Again, a
     STFax user could be auto-notified if a file is sent to their account or
     the file could be forwarded, via email.

  2. A software company could use the mini-BBS to provide updates, patches and
     software support to customers who are not connected to the Internet.

  3. An office worker who works from home could log into the mini-BBS, enter a
     secret door and upload files to the remote machine, from his local
     machine. This might be ideal for a worker who prefers to work part time
     from home and can quickly upload work, when requested, using a high
     transfer rate.

Future Additions and Features

These features are either 'in development' or soon to go into development, to be
included within v4.x, within the next few months. These short term features will
be made, free of charge, to existing customers (OEM or standalone), when
available:

Mailshot support. The ability to create internal and, possibly, external
documents, using special fields that pull information from the STFax phonebook.
For instance, if I wrote a message 'Dear [title] [surname],' STFax would pull
the relevant information from the phonebook and insert where needed. This would
become 'Dear Mr Smith', if I was sending a fax to a 'John Smith' contained
within the phonebook. This is great for fax broadcasting. You can create one
document, containing special STFax fields, choose (from the phonebook) who you
want to send the fax to, STFax faxes these people one by one, inserting the
information to the document from the phonebook. Everyone the fax is sent to
appears to have a customised fax.

Advanced mini-BBS. The ability to remotely retrieve and manipulate information
from/to STFax. A remote user could launch any terminal client, call STFax (via a
secret/special number perhaps), enter a password and then:

   - Remote access to new fax/voice messages - download voice or fax messages
     from 'accessible' accounts to their hard drive. For instance, a user who
     is on vacation in the States would be able to dial into STFax, at any
     time, and download their messages (voice or fax).

   - Remote message replacement - upload a new greeting message to replace the
     current message. A user might forget to change their account greeting
     message, leaving something similar to 'I am away at a meeting and will
     return to the office this afternoon', when they are in a remote country
     and unable to return to the office for a week. Therefore the user would
     record a greeting, upload to STFax and assign this as their system/account
     message.

   - Account configuration - the user could turn off (or on) auto-forwarding,
     alter the fax number that faxes are forwarded to or even change the script
     that is played when a caller enters their account and so on.

Cover page template selection. Users will be able to choose from a range of
cover page templates with quick preview options.

Enhanced auto-forwarding. Future versions of STFax will allow auto-forwarding of
voice and fax messages via various methods:

   - Via email - incoming voice and fax messages would be attached to an email
     message and forwarded to a remote email address. A user could have all new
     voice messages left in their account forwarded to their email address at
     the end of every day. The user could download their email from anywhere in
     the world then play the voice messages on any computer.

   - Via local HTML - incoming voice and fax messages could be made available on
     the companies internal server, probably within a hidden/protected
     directory. A user would be able to view this directory, via any web
     browser, from any location and at any time of the day. They would then be
     able to download the messages to their computer, for local playback or
     viewing.

Auto-forwarding could also be message specific. For instance CID (remote id,
caller id or 'keywords' for fax messages) would pick out specific messages, as
requested by the user, and only forward these to the email address or local
server.

Enhanced IO mode support. IO messages to be filtered in the same way as standard
voice and fax messages, plus some other improvements.

Internet faxing. STFax will support faxing across the Internet, via TPC. This is
a free service and vastly reduces the cost of broadcasting fax messages on a
global level. However, the downside is that not every worldwide location is
supported.

Requirements:

To use STFax 4, we recommend this minimum specification:

   - 14,400 bps fax (voice optional) modem (Rockwell, USR, Zyxel etc)
   - WB v3+
   - 10MB hard drive space
   - 3MB memory
   - 68020 processor

Recommended:

   - graphics board or 2Mb of chip to display big faxes
   - 68030/50 is the minimum needed to playback voice messages to Amiga audio

Supported Modems: US Robotics, ZyXEL, Dynalink, all Rockwell based modems.

STFax does *not* support ISDN modems and cards yet.

Prices:

   - full version 4.0: 98 DM (~ 59 US$)
   - upgrade to 4.0: 59 DM (~ 35 US$)

A demo version is available on our FTP server. Download

STFax is a product of Active Technologies and Simone Tellini. It is distributed
by Active Technologies and Haage & Partner (world-wide except for UK).

                     EXECUTIVE UPDATE BY THOMAS J. SCHMIDT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

September 14, 1999

TO: THE AMIGA COMMUNITY

Thanks for your notes and comments about our plans for Amiga. In the past couple
weeks, we've received hundreds -- if not thousands -- of emails and messages
from loyal Amigans worldwide, many of you expressing a concern about Amiga's
future based on recent reports in the media and in numerous chat rooms. I am so
impressed with the spirit and passion of this great community and I wanted to
make sure I told you that.

The fact is... to borrow from Mark Twain... the reports of Amiga's death have
been greatly exaggerated. To that end, I wanted to provide a little more detail
about our plans for Amiga... both as a product and as a company, and hopefully
clear up any confusion that exists.

First, I hope you'd agree that Amiga was never about a box. It was never about
an operating system either. Sure those things were part of what made the
original Amiga great, but at its heart, Amiga was simply about a better way.
Amiga was ahead of its time. Amiga promised to change the world. It ran against
conventional wisdom and was better than anything out there at the time. In fact,
we could all argue that it's still better than anything out there.

The ideals and spirit of that original Amiga are alive and well today. But to
limit Amiga to just one box, one product, one OS, is to keep Amiga from ever
seeing its full potential. Think about it.... The original Amiga never did
really reach its full potential despite its technical advantages and its cost
and ease of use advantages. Why? Because it never became ubiquitous. The
company's early vision was probably too limited for the vast potential that
Amiga offered.

The original Amiga was all about multi-media, so why not have Amiga running on
every type of device imaginable, on top of every other OS out there? That's the
beauty of Amiga and where we are as an industry. We're in the midst of a
revolution unlike anything the world has seen, and Amiga has never been better
positioned to change that world and make a bigger impact. Limiting Amiga to just
one box and one OS at this point would be like offering the world a better horse
and carriage at the dawn of the automotive age. Amiga and its revolutionary
spirit deserve better than that. Amiga is going to produce software technology
that will enable Internet services on an emerging category of products commonly
referred to as "Information Appliances". It is an exciting new mega trend in the
industry and we are excited about being at the forefront of this next great wave
in computing history. In addition, we have decided to work with business
partners who will deliver our software technology on their systems, rather than
enter the hardware business directly.

So long live Amiga, but if you think that Amiga was just a box, you've missed
the point. Amiga is about a better way. In the coming weeks and months, we
promise to keep you posted on progress against our plans for Amiga, and we thank
you for your continued support. Let's work together to enable Amiga to
revolutionize the industry and change the world!

Long live Amiga,

Thomas J. Schmidt
President & C.E.O.

[FEATURES]

   - Import/export audio from/to any platform. Exchange audio files with
     industry standard platforms including Windows, MacOS, Unix or dedicated
     hardware (DraCo, NewTek Toaster/Flyer, AD516/Studio16).
   - Internet friendly: MPEG layer 1, 2 and 3 (the popular MP3) import, Java
     ulaw import/export. Import multiple MP3 files, overlap them on the
     timeline to create automatic crossfades, add realtime effects such as EQ
     and stereo field expansion, then master to CDDA, all with ProStationAudio.
   - Hard-disk based non linear editing. Work with audio recordings up to 2GB
     each, regardless the amount of RAM memory installed. Disk streaming.
     Instant random access to any location.
   - Non destructive editing. Trim, cut, fade, crossfade audio recordings
     without affecting the original takes. Instantaneous operations regardless
     the file size.
   - Region-based editing. Any fragment of audio is accessible from an
     alpha-sorted list, managed by the application. Any fragment generated by
     cutting, bouncing, recording, gets automatically named and sorted. Let
     ProStationAudio take care of your most complex projects.
   - Visual approach. Build your projects managing visual audio blocks. Examine
     on-screen waveforms to create perfect edits. Each block can be distorted
     manually to create fades and trim its boundaries. Blocks can be dropped
     over blocks to create crossfades (or to have them automatically align in
     various ways). Multilayer graphics: objects, waveforms, fades/xfades,
     automation.
   - Extensive set of tools for positioning and aligning objects, ranges and the
     cursor. Accurate spotting to SMPTE locations, at sub-frame resolution.
     Tools for DJs such as shifting and scaling ranges. The intelligent Magic
     Wand tool lets you create perfect loops in a fraction of a second,
     automatically.
   - Automotion (tm), the automation engine. Create the perfect mix while
     letting the software remember all of your moves. Automation tracks can be
     graphically edited in the timeline window or recorded in realtime by
     grabbing the faders during playback.
   - Realtime design. Operate on faders, pans, effects parameters, even the
     virtual tape speed, always in realtime, to tune up your mix on the fly or
     create dynamics effects. These dynamic effects can optionally be recorded
     to disk, again in realtime, while playing.
   - Advanced auditioning. Fast-forward and slow-motion during playback.
     Realtime time stretching. The auditioning signal can be digitally recorded
     to disk in realtime.
   - ALPS architecture for audio DSP plugins: unlimited expansion possibilities.
     Multiple DSP inserts allow to apply different DSP effects to each track, in
     realtime. Multiple master DSP inserts (post-fader processing).
   - ALPS plugins: freely accessible modules for realtime DSP operations.
     Downloadable from the web site. Include dynamic compression, several EQ
     modules, spatial processing, ducking, delays, ... www.audiolabs.it/plugins

                  SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT PRICES OF HIGHEND GAMES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> 109DM for Amiga game is tooo much ... people will copy this
> Better try 50DM and sell 3 times more

This is VERY bad if people think like that...

Please be invited to post that message on your site. Note that it is no
statement by Hyperion Software (i am not working for them), but a private
statement of myselves due to my knowledge of the market (i am a computer
scientist).

Now i do not know what EXACTLY the license costed, but licenses for such games
are usually in the range of around DM 100000. Let's do a short calculation:

>109 DM => 30-40 DM for the actual developers for the game AFAIK.

Let's assume 8000 sold copies (which would be pretty high for an Amiga game !!!)

8000*40 = 320000

Now we take away the 100000, and we are at 220000 win only, after around 4
months (i estimate) work.

   - The guy investing money might get a higher part of the profit, because of
     the risk he took (that is common business praxis). Still i am quite sure
     each coder will get around 3-5 marks per sold copy. This would then be
     around 6000-10000 a month.
   - We have to see clearly that 8000 copies on a Amiga Game are in most cases
     pretty unrealistic. More likely are 3000-4000. Then we would have the
     salary of the programmers at something between 2000 and 4000 marks a
     month.
   - If the price would be reduced that would even be a smaller profit. Hold
     against this that people of the qualification of the Frieden-brothers or
     Peter Annuss get a monthly salary between 8000 and 10000 marks on the PC
     and Mac Market easily.

I don't say "All is money", but you surely don't do everything for free. Money
has to be a PART of the thing. 50 DM a copy for a licensed NEW game is
absolutely unrealistic. The only option to this would be not starting the
porting business at the beginning (and maybe do games for PC/Mac instead where
people pay this money).

Hyperion is i think giving the Amiga Games market it's last real chance. People
should not waste it. If these games are not really bought, this screws up all
future chances for Ports of new PC Games.

It has also be considered that not the PRICE restrains Hyperion's market, but
the hardware (which is rather high in the minimum)... the market is pretty
small. So i think 109 marks is a reasonably price tag. Added to this Sony
Playstation games have often the same initial price tag, and there are a lot
more Playstations than PPC Boards.

Also consider that Heretic II and Shogo are not the usual "Lowend Amiga Game
which has to be sold cheaper", they are ports of (nearly) up to date PC games
!!!

And especially you should NEVER compare the current price for the PC version of
Heretic II to the price of the Amiga Version. On the PC the game is already some
months old. Initially it also was in a similar price region.

I also mention that Preorders for Hyperion's games are cheaper: Only 89 marks.

I also want to mention that the License which Hyperion required - as they
announced when they first announced this - with Monolith not only covers the
game Shogo, but ALL FUTURE GAMES running on the LithTech engine can be licensed
on the same conditions. Examples of such games are Blood 2 and Sanity, and there
are other games (RPGs, Strategy Games, 3D Shooters,...). Of course that these
games WOULD be ported requires the current titles from Hyperion to sell good.

And to people who always compare Heretic II/Shogo to Quake: Quake was

   - for 68k
   - without 3D Support

Not comparable.

I don't think it was ever an option for Hyperion/Titan to make these games
cheaper. The option would have been not making them at all. Licensing games is
EXPANSIVE.

In a recent discussion someone threw in "Why don't they license cheaper games".
As to my knowledge $50000 is quite on the low end. Of course you might get VERY
OLD GAMES cheaper. But these also will sell much less, and will most likely
contain PC ASM, which might make them virtually unportable. Selling highend
PC-ports at a DECENT price is really the only option for making such games for
the Amiga. And well, we are all HAPPY that Hyperion makes, these games, right ?
So we will pay them what they are worth. I for myselves will do. This - and
Wipeout of Digital Images - is THE chance to finally GET PowerPC games. And
other companies are watching. People, don't waste it for some bucks...

                    CURRENT STATUS OF THE HERETIC II PROJECT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16-September-1999: Progress update by Hans-Joerg Frieden

Server

The (dedicated) server has now advanced into a state where a PC-based client can
connect and play a game on it. There are a few bugs left in the code, most
notably those based on endian-ness conflicts (for example, the player does not
loose hitpoints, but rather the damage adds to his lifepoint totals).

Network code is based on the bsdsocket.library as provided by all common Amiga
TCP/IP stacks for maximum compatibility. Although the server compiles with both
StormC and GNU GCC-2.95, no ixemul code is used for this. There is a PPC and 68k
compile of the dedicated server.

Client/Video

Most of the work on the client so far has been on the software and hardware
refresh libraries. The software renderer is almost complete now. We have decided
to use Steffen Haeuser's CHUNKYPPC library, since the renderer will have to deal
with a myriad of different screen modes and this library provides conversion
routines for most of them, and also support for AGA (planar) screen modes.

For the hardware renderer, we have considered using the Mesa3D graphics library,
but found out quickly that it would not be efficient enough for this task. We
therefore decided to start working on our own GL-Subset library that will be
optimized for the features we need for the Heretic II GL refresh library. MiniGL
will sit on top of the Warp3D rasterizer interface to provide support for all
existing and future 3D graphics cards, and will later be updated to also support
the G4's Altivec unit, as well as graphics cards with built-in geometry
processors.

The movies will be done using the Smacker video codec. We considered doing our
own video stuff, since there is no original Amiga version of Smacker, but
decided that we would not achieve the same excellent results as Smacker, at
least not in the given time frame. We therefore licenced Smacker from RAD Game
Tools, and the porting is currently in the works.

Client/Sound

No work has been done on the sound support yet. We do not expect too much
difficulties here, since Hyperion's upcoming sound library will provide a very
flexible interface which will incorporate many of the features of EAXTM and
DirectSound3DTM, so the sound system will be very straightforward.

Client/System

Input and system specifics not mentioned above are currently under
investigation. No problems are expected, though.

Dynamic Linking

Hyperion has developed a dynamic linking model that is very close to Micro$oft
Windows' DLL mechanism. Since the shared library model under AmigaOS is
radically different than the model used on other OS'es, including Windows and
Linux, we decided to build our own shared library concept. The current
executable already uses this mechanism, and it showed that this works very well.

                        THE PHOENIX PLATFORM CONSORTIUM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     == THE PHOENIX PLATFORM CONSORTIUM ==

We are pleased to announce the acceptance of provisional charter for the Phoenix
Platform Consortium.

Phoenix signatories believe it is time to place our destiny back in the hands of
folks who understand what the Amiga is all about. You will notice members of the
original Jay Miner team within our ranks.

Unlike other new entities we will not field questions from newsgroups, mailing
lists, or in email, nor will we be erecting a marketing facade to false hopes.
Results and honest direction are our mandate.

The Phoenix Platform Consortium will assume responsibility for aid and
recommendation for reference platforms for the Amiga users who wish to upgrade
their present Amigas, as we establish an open migration path to a new platform.
That platform will in spirit and in feel be a new Amiga experience while
incorporating and surpassing the features found on the desktop elsewhere today.

More information will be posted when we have facts to present. Please do NOT
email the participants in curiosity. We ask for your patience in this matter.
Please respect the wishes of the participants named below. There is much to do
and we have just begun.

As information becomes available it will be posted on mailing lists, newsgroups,
and at the following website: owlnet.net/phoenix/ which will be up shortly. This
announcement is freely repostable.

Thanks, from the Phoenix Platform Consortium, currently:

                HYPERION BRINGS SMACKER VIDEO CODEC TO THE AMIGA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperion is pleased to announce that it has entered into a license agreement to
bring "Smacker", an industry standard video codec developed by RAD Game Tools
and used in over 1400 games, to the Amiga.

Smacker is currently available for Mac (68K and PPC), DOS, Windows 3.X, Windows
95 and Windows NT and provides for both file-format and API multi-platform
compatibility.

"We could have developed our own video codec", says Ben Hermans, managing
partner of Hyperion, "but since both Heretic 2 from Activision and Shogo: MAD
from Monolith use Smacker, we decided to cut down on development time for both
titles and license and port Smacker instead. On top of that, Smacker is really
very fast and very efficient if you are only using 256 colors. It is doubtful we
would have been able to achieve the same result with the limited development
time available to us."

Further information about Smacker can be found at www.smacker.com.

INTRODUCTION

     This review can be considered a follow up to Aminet's docs/rview/pfs2.txt
     done a few months back.

     I don't think it comes to you by surprise, if I say that FFS is slow and
     outdated in many ways. You're limited to measly 2 GB per partition and a
     total of 4 GB per drive. Even with the finest hardware, FFS leaves a lot
     to be desired for, due to it's not-so-great performance. On the top of
     that, there's the validation problem, which gets the worse, the bigger
     your drive is.

     Here's the problem: should your Amiga crash or something else go wrong
     during a write operation (like a power loss or something), the bitmap of
     FFS disk will get invalidated. You won't be able to write anything on the
     disk, until the bitmap is valid again. P>Re-validating the disk is the
     time-consuming bit here, and it automatically takes place after a reboot.
     Basically, it just scans through _all_ files on the invalid drive(s), so
     it can correctly reflect (un)used areas in the bitmap. Doesn't sound so
     bad, eh? Well, it's _almost_ bearable on a 100 MB drive, but try this on
     500 MB and above! First the validating takes forever, then up comes a
     requester saying something's still wrong (long experience shows about one
     time out of four it can't get it right by itself). Of course, the bitmap
     is still invalid, so you're basically screwed. If you don't have a disk
     repair program, it's reformat time. If you do have a disk repair program,
     it's time for another tedious session. Not much can be done about all this
     using conventional methods, either. Crashes do occur on any given system
     from time to time, and as you may or may not have noticed, they usually
     take place at the most inconvenient moment.

     So, what we need is a filesystem that doesn't suffer from this kind of
     problems. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Professional File System 3, the
     followup to Professional File System 2. PFS3 supports partitions up to 104
     GB and drives up to 2 TB (2000 GB!) using TD64 or direct SCSI, whilst
     delivering up to 500% speed increase over FFS. Most important of all, your
     disks are kept valid at all times. No more waiting for the validation to
     complete (and praying that it would get it right this time).

     PFS3 comes on CD-ROM, with a manual provided in AmigaGuide format. Owners
     of AGA Amigas, who are into gaming, might be delighted to know there's a
     bonus game called "Kang Fu" included.

INSTALLATION

     Installation consists of two distinctive phases:

     In the first phase, all the required files are copied on your HDD by the
     installer script. The actual filesystem isn't usable directly from CD, as
     it needs to be serialized with your name and serial number first. What
     this means, is you MUST use the installer script to get started.

     The installer lets you choose between different PFS3 flavors; the ones
     available are Normal, Direct SCSI, Multiuser, Direct SCSI Multiuser and
     Floppy versions. Besides the generic 68000 version, there are optimized
     versions of each for 68020, 68040 and 68060.

     In the second phase, you need to install PFS3 on the RDB(s) of your HDD(s)
     using HDInstTools, HDToolBox or similar solution. Reading the manual
     before proceeding with this is _highly recommended_! The AmigaGuide manual
     contains in-depth instructions for installation, with clarifying screenshot
     pictures where necessary.

     If you're upgrading from PFS2 or AFS, the next step will be easy; it's just
     a question of "dropping in" the new filesystem. PFS3 is fully compatible
     with PFS2 and Ami-FileSafe and therefore these two can simply be replaced
     by PFS3. However, should you wish to exploit the new PFS3 features to the
     full, it would appear that a reformat is obligatory.

     Unfortunately, existing FFS volumes need to be reformatted. PFS3 stores
     information on the disk in a different (more reliable and efficient)
     manner. Getting your system partition under PFS3 could be tricky, so
     here's how I did it (with PFS2 v4.2 to be exact, but same would apply to
     PFS3). First, I copied everything onto another drive and then set up the
     RDB with HDToolBox. After this, there was the reboot bit, in order for the
     new settings to take place. I booted up from the Workbench 3.1 floppy and
     issued a format command on the system partition, followed by "copy
     dh1:dh0backup/#? dh0: all clone quiet".

     Now that these two installation phases have been completed, PFS3 is at your
     service.

WHAT'S NEW IN PFS3?

     PFS3 introduces extra long filenames up to 106 characters. You can set the
     maximum filename length from anything between 31 and 106 characters, using
     the tool "setfnsize". The weird thing about this tool is that you have to
     decrease one from the value it reports, to know what's the actual filename
     lenght. In other words, if setfnsize reports the maximum filename size to
     be 32, it's in reality 31. The same works the other way around: if you
     want to have 106 characters filename length, you'll have to input 107 to
     setfnsize! Confusing, eh? Well, disregarding this illogicality, the
     setfnsize idea is good and it works. ELFN's (Extra Long FileNames) should
     be good news at least to all MP3 fans. It often feels like stuffing a size
     46 foot to a size 39 shoe, when trying to shorten the longest MP3 filenames
     down to 30 characters.

     However, one has to be careful with setfnsize, as it is possible to specify
     value larger to the current length. Should you wish to return to lower
     values, and therefore shorter filenames, a reformat is required. All the
     programs I tried, worked fine with 106 character filenames. I guess this
     remarkable milestone means pre-LFN and after-LFN eras are reality on
     Amiga, too! :)

     It's unfortunately impossible to set the maximum filename length to FFS
     standard, 30 characters. The minimum default is 31 (or 32, like setfnsize
     likes to think). This is bad news to all those, who'd wish to retain 100%
     compatibility to FFS users. One practical example of the problems that
     could arise as a result of this: the PFS2 FAQ included on PFS3 CD-ROM
     contains a couple of filenames that are 32 characters in length, but the
     CD-ROM is obviously mastered on a system, where the maximum has been 31.
     As a net result, a few filename extensions have been cut from .html to
     .htm, and you can imagine what effects does this have... Yes, some
     documents aren't readable by following the links, or rather they're highly
     compliant to the "404 not-found" standard. I guess I must also mention that
     the maximum disk label length is 31 characters, again one character more
     than FFS volumes can have. I think these extra long filenames are a Very
     Good Thing, but it should be possible to use the same length limitations
     as FFS, if one wishes to do so.

     There's finally a dedicated disk repair & recovery tool with graphical user
     interface, called "PFS Doctor"! Too bad I can't say much about it, my only
     experience being a brief test-drive under WinUAE (the Amiga emulator for
     PC) and emulated 68020 processor. The program itself is compiled to run on
     all processors, but it doesn't work on 68000. So far, it remains unclear
     what exactly causes this, but I guess it's either to GadToolsBox or the
     required progress.gadget file to blame. Great Effects Development are
     probably working on this problem right now.

     The delete directory can now hold up to 992 entries. You can set the number
     of deldirblocks from 0 to 32. With each block holding 31 entries, this
     translates to various stages between 0 (deldir disabled) and 992 entries.
     The default is 2 blocks, equaling 62 entries. Admittably, the deldir is a
     remarkable invention, and it's saved me time on several occasions, but I
     think things could get very confusing with _that_ many entries in the
     deldir! For future versions, I'd like to see some steps taken to preserve
     the directory structure somehow, as this would clear things up
     considerably. If only the filenote could indicate the original
     path/filename, this would be a good start.

     Also, a small tool to erase all deldir entries would be very good thing to
     have. Let's imagine you've just deleted 100 files, sized something like 20
     megabytes each. Well, accessing the deldir naturally causes the filesystem
     to seek through the files, obviously to check their integrity (i.e., to
     see if they're still in one piece). With that many big files, this could
     take a _long_ time. You too see the need for "flush deldir"? As an added
     bonus, this would enable one to instantly get rid of those things that
     need to vanish permanently (also called "covering your tracks", but from
     who? it depends entirely on person!). At the moment, the only way to
     permanently lose something, is to save over a dummy file as many times,
     that you have deldir entries. Multiuser or no multiuser, privacy issues
     are becoming more and more important. (Never mind my jabber, there's
     simply enough civil libertarian in me to pay attention in these kind of
     issues...)

     One of the best new things (IMHO) in PFS3 is a proper format command
     replacement, called "pfsformat". It also gives you the possibility to
     specify the filenamesize and the number of deldirblocks as well. With
     verify enabled, pfsformat is _significantly_ slower than the original C=
     format command. Hey, at least it seems to do actual verification work,
     unlike C= format! No more problems on large drives either, so you can
     forget that quick-format kludge on partitions residing above 4 GB mark.

     Then there's are miscellaneous bits & pieces, making the PFS3 CD-ROM pretty
     much stand-alone. Such as, Installer 43.3 is now included, along with
     HDInstTools and PFS2 FAQ. All this means: no more installation script
     problems, you can throw HDToolBox away for good, and should you develop
     problems of any kind, help to most issues is near without the need to
     connect to internet.

REVIEW

     At the time of writing, I've had PFS3 to play with for a bit over week. The
     filesystem itself feels every bit as good as PFS2 v4.2, even though some of
     the tools still leave to be desired for. It's good that PFSLS works on
     68000 now, but PFS Doctor (or Diskvalid) would be very nice too... Oh
     well, so far I've managed just fine without any repair-tools, but as you
     know -- it never hurts to have some aces up in the sleeve.

     It must be noted PFS3 performs slightly better when compared to PFS2 v4.2,
     at least on my setup. When backing things up to DAT tape, the average
     speed per minute is approx. 1.5 MB higher than with PFS2 ;) Big deal, eh?
     Well, this measly increase could very well translate to exponential
     performance increase on a real heavy-duty system!

     All the same, PFS3 delivers much higher performance than FFS in all given
     areas. Simply said, the speed increase is awesome. Read/write operations,
     scanning directories and deleting files was never this fast before! Not to
     mention, parallel accesses perform much better. PFS3 makes even
     directory-cached FFS look like a snail. On my setup, it takes about four
     seconds to read in a directory of 1283 files, using a practical
     application! Real-world usage is the best of all tests, don't you think?

     The manual states: "volume is always valid, no matter what happens". It
     turns out, even switching power off during a write operation won't damage
     PFS3 volumes. A technique called "atomic commit" is used, ensuring correct
     directory structure at all times. If a crash or power loss occurs at the
     time of overwriting a file, the original file is still in one piece. No
     more waiting for the drive(s) to validate. This is probably the best of
     all PFS3 features, bound to save you most time in the long run.

     Now to a real-life experience of the reliability factor... Due to the hot
     summer, my power supply died, but before I got a replacement (a PC power
     supply modified for Amiga use), the dying power supply caused plenty of
     momentary power losses and crashes. Since I was (and still am) unable to
     run Diskvalid on my 68000 based A500, I ported an "image" of my entire
     system partition over to the PC (using PC2Amiga and DEV: handler from
     Aminet). So, I created an appropriate mountlist for this "hard-disk file"
     under WinUAE and tested it with Diskvalid (which would now run, due to the
     fact it's possible to emulate 68020 on WinUAE). Out of 10,000+ files, only
     three were fragmented! Now, think about your average FFS volume. Can you
     claim all your files (except for three of them) are still in continuous,
     unscattered chunks after a few months use? And that defragmenting these
     few misguided ones would be as easy as copying them elsewhere and then
     back?

     The only other "problem" (not really a problem, but rather a sign of
     inefficiency) with the volume, was that the S: directory contained an
     empty directory block (this can sometimes happen if a directory has been
     extensively used), and I must say that directory has been in extensive
     use! That's all, despite all the (both deliberate and natural) crashes
     (and more recently, power losses) over the months. To be honest, I was
     kind of expecting something something more serious. Boo-hoo, now I'm
     disappointed! :) Disbelievers, take note: I'm telling the whole world
     right here I haven't had any problems, but if you still feel like emailing
     me every once in a while, asking if everything's still all right with my
     drives, that's fine with me! ;)

     PFS3 is fully AmigaDOS compatible with certain reservations. Fully
     compatible, yes, but only at filesystem level. Applications accessing the
     disk directly, thus bypassing the filesystem, won't work if they were
     specifically designed with a FFS disk in mind. Disk repair and optimizer
     tools are examples of such. Then again, you don't need FFS disk repair
     tools for PFS3 volumes, as PFS3 doesn't suffer from FFS problems. You may
     also forget disk optimizers when using PFS3, as the filesystem itself does
     very good job at saving data optimally. One of the new listed features of
     PFS3 is "improved long term performance". I guess this translates to a
     even more intelligent algorithm to determine data placement. Or whatever.
     Go figure.

     Have you ever undeleted something from an FFS volume? I'm sure most people
     have done this, or at least tried to. Well, with PFS3, you needn't scan
     the _entire_ volume for deleted directory entries (and wait for an
     eternity for the scan to finish), as there's an invisible directory called
     ".deldir" in the root of each PFS3 volume, containing up to 992 latest
     deleted files. Restoring files from this directory is as easy as simply
     copying them elsewhere. Preferably another drive, but experience has shown
     me there's no problem even if the same drive was used. The only drawback is
     the lengthy scanning, if you've recently deleted some really big files. I
     mean something like a whole CD-full of song-length WAV's or so. You get
     the idea.

     If you've got programs that produce logfiles, you might appreciate the
     automatic truncation feature PFS3 has got on offer. You simply specify the
     maximum size for the file and it stops growing indefinitely. Chances are,
     if you've got a TCP/IP stack installed on your Amiga, this feature will
     come most handy.

     As a caveat from an A500 user's point of view (of course, this isn't
     applicable to users of Big, Powerful Amigas), it must be said that PFS is
     more processor intensive than FFS. You notice this particularly when
     deleting Really Big files from your disk. Still, this isn't a big deal to
     worry about, as PFS3 performs remarkably well even on a 7 MHz 68000. This
     could actually be an advantage from a power user's point of view, knowing
     that PFS3 takes advantage of faster CPU's to the full and therefore
     delivers more performance.

CONCLUSIONS

     PFS3 is well worth a look, particularly if you're fed up with FFS. After
     getting my hands on PFS2 v4.2, I decided I won't be going back to FFS
     anymore. FFS is completely banned from my system for several months now.
     During the whole time I've used PFS2 v4.2 on my system (ever since the
     previous review), I haven't had any disk-related problems, while on FFS
     they were a (more or less) daily event.

     No, you won't believe it until you see it. Yes, you will be amazed. No, you
     don't want to go back anymore. Yes, you will wonder how the hell could you
     put up with FFS.

     Here are the pros and cons in a nutshell:

     + No more validate-wait
     + Speed
     + Reliability
     + Big drive support
     + Easy undeletion of files
     + Long enough filenames for all imaginable uses
     + No fragmentation problem over time
     - Installation could be hard for novice or even intermediate users
    (- Some of the add-on tools don't work on 68000)

     OVERALL: 97%

     Even better than trying to cope with FFS and be armed to the teeth with
     various disk-repair tools, is to own and use Professional File System 3.
     It's an essential purchase to anyone, who ever experienced inconvenience
     with FFS.

     If you're having any doubts, you should try and get over them; the only
     possibility I see for messing things up with PFS3, would be a result of
     NOT reading the manual prior to installation phase two.

            OPEN LETTER TO THE AMIGA COMMUNITY BY THOMAS J. SCHMIDT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

September 17, 1999

There has been a great deal of confusion and frustration expressed in the news
groups and via email over the past several weeks. I apologize that we have not
been more direct in our communications, and I want to set the record straight.

First, per my previous messages, I continue to be impressed with the passion and
commitment of this community. You have "hung in there" through a number of
upheavals over the past years, and through several false starts on
next-generation Amiga platforms. You deserve better. I have received many, many
emails over the past two weeks, expressing your opinions and frustrations. Let
me try and summarize what I have heard.

Many of you acknowledge the fact that we are focusing on software for the coming
generation of "Internet appliances." We are very excited about the new Amiga
Operating Environment, the work we are doing with Linux (and other operating
systems that support Java), and the huge growth curve in Internet appliances
that we are going to ride. You have gracefully wished us well in this endeavor,
for that, I thank you. As you know, we announced in July that we were pursuing
the development of a "multimedia convergence computer" that would serve as the
next-generation Amiga desktop computer. After the change in management at Amiga,
we reviewed all our product plans. To be honest, the ability for us to deliver
the MCC was unrealistic. Furthermore, I have fundamentally decided that it would
be better to partner with a wide variety of hardware partners, rather than
compete against them with a product of our own.

From your perspective, one big problem exists. Sounds great, but what does this
new direction have to do with the original Amiga computer? Quite honestly,
nothing! We realize that this does not satisfy the desire of the Amiga community
for a next-generation Amiga. In response, I remain committed to seek out
partners who are interested in developing a next-generation Amiga computer and
operating system. We have been following the discussions amongst the newly
formed "Phoenix Platform Consortium" and talking to companies interested in
supplying the next-generation Amiga. We are open to the possibility of licensing
the MCC product specification and design that is now on the shelf to companies
that are interested in further developing the Amiga desktop computer product
line. We believe that this could be an attractive business opportunity for
another company.

In summary, we are continuing to focus our resources on setting software
standards for the coming generation of Internet appliances. We are not planning
to offer hardware devices, but will work with hardware manufacturers who want to
license our technology. As far as offering next-generation Amiga systems, we are
open to talking to companies who want to offer such a product. For those of you
who are excited about the Amiga Operating Environment running on a wide variety
of future Internet appliances, we invite you to track our progress and
activities over the coming months. The Internet appliance software model that we
are putting together will open up an exciting new era of software development
that we think will be very interesting to the type of innovative thinkers who
were drawn to the Amiga computer in years past.

Best Regards,

Thomas J. Schmidt
President and CEO
Amiga, Inc.
