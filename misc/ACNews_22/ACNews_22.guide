                    AMIGA INC. AND EYETECH FORM PARTNERSHIP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

June 6, 2000 - Snoqualmie, WA USA - Amiga Inc. of Snoqualmie, WA is pleased to
announce a strategic relationship with Eyetech Group Ltd. of Stokesley, North
Yorkshire, UK to manufacture the first release of the Next Generation Amiga
Development Machines and to distribute these in Great Britain and the Republic
of Ireland.

This will no doubt come as welcome news to the British Amiga community who have
long enjoyed an excellent relationship with Eyetech.

Eyetech is well known as a leading supporter of Amiga - and the Amiga Community
- of great integrity. Eyetech's involvement in the Amiga market dates back to
1993.

Amiga and Eyetech both share a vision and strategy to re-establish the next
generation Amiga Operating Environment as the leading multimedia
hardware-independent delivery platform for the year 2000 and beyond. Both
companies believe that this strategy will return Amiga to its rightful position
as a leader in multimedia computing, and thereby redeliver the recognition and
pride back to the loyal Amiga community that has waved the flag over these last
15 years.

Our relationship with long time company Chairman, Alan Redhouse, proves that
Eyetech has a firm belief in our product, our company, and our community. Of
particular interest to both Amiga and the community is Eyetechs EZTower Mk5
which networks together - in a single tower system - both an A1200 (with
optional PPC/BVision) with a next generation Amiga Development Machine and the
Amiga SDK. "The reputation of Eyetech as well as their ability to offer such a
high quality and wide-ranging choice to the Amiga community in the form of both
the EZTower Mk5 and the EZDev-Plus - Eyetech's stand-alone DevBox - is
unprecedented. We wholeheartedly support Alan and his team at Eyetech and join
the community in welcoming Eyetech to the Amiga future." said Randall Hughes,
Vice President Sales and Strategic Alliances at Amiga.

Alan Redhouse commented: "I am delighted that Eyetech has been chosen as Amiga's
partner to help UK companies and individuals take advantage of porting and
developing applications under the new Amiga Operating Environment. We will of
course continue to service and support Classic Amiga users Worldwide from the
5000 square feet (500 square meters) of warehouse space dedicated to Amiga
products here at our UK base.

"The Classic Amiga also forms the basis of our Multimedia Presentation and Kiosk
systems as its tightly integrated, purpose-designed preemptive multitasking,
multimedia-centric operating system allows us to achieve levels of performance,
reliability and cost-effectiveness which cannot even be approached on a PC-based
system. We are now looking forward to developing new, high-performance
multimedia products around the new generation Amiga Operating Environment, as
well as providing continued support for our existing commercial and leisure
customers."

Eyetech's developer platforms for the new generation Amiga Operating Environment
will be officially released on 1st June 2000. The product portfolio will include
EZTower Mk 5 based integrated systems, upgrade kits for existing EZTower users
and the stand-alone EZDev-Plus system. All systems will ship with Eyetech's
5-click Amiga - Linux networking software, specially tailored for the new Amiga
Operating Environment.

About Eyetech

Eyetech was originally established in 1983 to bring the benefit of automatic
data collection systems to large commercial companies. The Company been closely
involved in many high-profile projects - from the automatic toll collection
systems at the Dartford River Crossing (London, UK) to most of the bar coded
track-and-trace systems in use by the UK national parcel services.

Eyetech was founded in 1983 as a subsidiary of an international UK quoted plc.
Since late 1985 - following a management buy out - Eyetech has traded as a
private limited company. The company has mainly been involved in producing
bespoke commercial software/systems - mainly under Unix/AIX - particularly in
the transport and distribution sector. Eyetechs specialization has been in track
& trace systems using bar codes - in fact most UK parcels carriers that use bar
codes use a system designed and/or implemented by Eyetech. The company also
manufactures bar code decoders and industrial (networked) shop floor data
capture and access control systems.

Eyetech became interested in the Amiga, and became a registered Amiga developer,
towards the end of 1993 : Eyetech's Amiga-related commercial systems currently
cover two main areas: As an integrated multimedia development/mass delivery
platform for its existing customer base with custom systems built around Classic
Amiga architecture.

Using rehoused Classic Amiga hardware as a low cost multitasking platform for
shop floor data collection/control applications in smaller industrial companies,
allowing simultaneous local enquiries and the passing back of data to
(typically) an accounts machine as a background process.

In developing Amiga expertise over the course of the last few years or so
Eyetech needed to provide hardware and software components which were not
commonly available ex-stock, competitively priced or of industrial quality from
normal Amiga suppliers. The Company therefore needed to design and/or sourced
these products elsewhere, and initially entered the retail mail order business
by making surplus stock available to the rest of the Amiga community. This side
of the business has continued to develop, resulting in Eyetech becoming one of
the largest mail order retailers of Amiga products in the English-speaking
World.

@node not02 "[THE WORLD FOUNDRY] JUNE 2000 UPDATE"
                      [THE WORLD FOUNDRY] JUNE 2000 UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Ed Collins <collins-e@dnet.co.uk>

Hi

  1. General Update.

     May could have been better. There was numerous problems with compiler bugs
     driving both chris and massi mad. The problems were traced to bugs in the
     StormC V3 compiler which wasted a lot of their time chasing code bugs that
     didn't exist. On top of that Rob had a harddrive failure which didn't lose
     much work but the replacement drive refused to format and took over a week
     to get his A4000 working again with the new drive.

  2. Explorer 2260 Update.

     News this month:

      - Continuted working on MiniGL engine and object editor. Started modifying
        MiniGL texture code to support more formats and automatic card-friendly
        format conversion.
      - Fixed some problems with parts of the interface code, began an
        abstraction layer to make interface component handling code easier to
        port to Linux.
      - Extended object editor loading system to support plugin-style load
        libraries.

  3. Maim & Mangle Update.

     News this month:

      - There has been far too many problems with bugs in StormC V3. A lot of
        development time has been lost due to these compiler problems. We are
        switching development over to the GCC compiler (we may use StormC V4
        when it is released if the bugs we've experienced have been fixed).
      - The game engine is now running under miniGL, on both 060 and PPC.
      - Work has started on conversion of our editor tools to use miniGL. These
        should be ready within 2-3 weeks.

  4. Next News Update

     1st July 2000

@node not03 "SYSMON 1.14 PUBLIC BETA RELEASE"
                        SYSMON 1.14 PUBLIC BETA RELEASE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Etienne Vogt" <vogt@alice.obspm.fr>

Hi there,

A new public beta release of Sysmon, my system enhancement and monitoring
package is available from my home page. You can download it at
http://mesopk.obspm.fr/vogt/amigasoft.html

Since it is a BETA version, I ask anyone who downloads it to not distribute it
further. In particular, don't upload it to Aminet. I will do that myself whem I
think it is stable enough.

Below is the readme file with a list of changes since the last Aminet release.
You can also access the main documentation file from my home page.

INTRODUCTION

Sysmon is a system monitoring and enhancing package based on a shared library
and Shell based support commands. It requires AmigaOS 2.04 or higher.
Installation of Richard Körber's Identify.library (util/libs/Identify.lha on
Aminet) is recommanded if you want the Sysmon monitor to be able to identify
expansion boards.

If your Amiga has a MMU (Memory Management Unit), it is also recommanded, but
not required, that you install Thomas Richter's mmu.library, available from
Aminet (util/libs/MMULib.lha).

Some of the features provided by Sysmon are:

   - Precise CPU usage timing for all tasks with very low overhead.
   - System message logging daemon like UNIX syslogd (useful for debugging).
   - Safe System shutdown script (useful for BBS's and networked machines).
   - Functions allowing to send/receive systemwide broadcast messages.
   - New Alert function (the Guru is back) allowing detailed logging.
   - New system functions related to tasks, including an enhanced and bug fixed
     task signal exception mechanism.
   - Executive compatible SysInfo.library to query tasks CPU usage (only
     cumulated CPU usage is currently implemented).

This is a public *** BETA *** release, so it's not a finished product. If you
find any bug, please report it back to me. My E-Mail address is listed in this
file.

Sysmon has been developped and tested on the following configurations:

   - A4000T 68060 AGA, 2 Mb Chip 40 Mb Fast, OS 3.5, 1 Gb SCSI HD
   - A500 68000 ECS, 1 Mb Chip 1.5 Mb Slow 2 Mb Fast, OS 3.1, 20 Mb IDE-XT + 50
     Mb SCSI + 115 Mb SCSI HDs
   - A4000 68040 AGA + CV64/3D (CGfx 3), 2 Mb Chip 16 Mb Fast, OS 3.5, 250 Mb
     IDE + 1 Gb SCSI + 1Gb SCSI HDs
   - A3000 68030 ECS, 2 Mb Chip 8 Mb Fast, OS 3.5, 100 Mb + 2 Gb + 4 Gb SCSI HDs
   - A500 68040(PP&S) ECS, 1 Mb Chip 2 Mb Fast16 8 Mb Fast32, OS 2.04, 165 Mb
     SCSI HD

What has not been tested at all is operation on PPC accelerator boards (I don't
have one). The library itself completely ignores the PPC at present but there is
always the possibility that some of the patches made to exec will be
incompatible with the PPC software. Note that the PowerUp PPC kernel is already
considered 'unsupported' as it is not compatible with Thomas Richter's
mmu.library (which will be used more extensively in future versions of Sysmon).
Don't blame me or Thomas about this, we're not responsible for the lack of
information about the PowerUp kernel internals. On the other hand, any
information about the behaviour of this software with the WarpUp PPC kernel
installed will be welcome.

This software is intended for experienced users. In particular, there are no GUI
tools available yet; so if you are a mouse-maniac user that don't like typing
Shell commands or editing ASCII configuration files, I'm afraid that this
software is not for you ;-) .

CHANGES

     V1.14
      - The library now calls ColdReboot() via a cached vector to bypass patches
        that may interfere with resets. It needs to be able to reset the system
        even from supervisor mode or with all tasks frozen. Note that the
        mmu.library patch is still called as mmu.library will be opened before
        caching the destination address of the ColdReboot() vector.
      - smSendBroadcastMsg() didn't set the BMF_DOOMSDAY flag automatically.
        Fixed. The timeout as also limited to 1/10th second when a reset is
        pending.
      - Added OLDMMURESET config option to force reinstallation of the boot MMU
        config before reboot on a keyboard trapped reset. Use only on systems
        that fail to reset properly otherwise as sending a KBD_RESETHANDLERDONE
        command from supervisor mode is a bit dirty.
      - Updated StartSM, Broadcast and AlertDump commands. AlertDump will now
        translate the Guru Meditation number.
      - Added the BcMTest broadcast messages test client.
      - Added the Show KickTag and Show Broadcast commands to the Sysmon
        monitor.

     V1.13 First public beta release of Sysmon V1
      - More functions added to the library.
      - New config options, TRAPRESET, MOVEVBR, RAMLIBPATCH.
      - New support commands Broadcast, AlertDump.
      - Rewrote exec task signal exception handling completely.
      - Added new task scheduling states TS_HIBERNATE, TS_WAITAND.
      - Rewrote exec Alert() routine, adding a reset resistant logging buffer,
        reintroducing the 'Guru Meditation' message and using mmu.library if
        available to properly write the alert data to the zero page.
      - Added a new alert.hook resident module (V41) to also provide the new
        display to deferred deadend alerts.
      - Added a countdown to the shutdown script and a QUICK option for the
        keyboard reset trap feature.
      - Added broadcast messages.
      - smHalt() now uses smFreeze() to stop other tasks instead of RemTask().
      - More commands implemented in the Sysmon monitor.
      - Added an Executive compatible SysInfo.library, with support only for
        cumulated CPU usage at present.
      - Documentation updated and converted to AmigaGuide format.

Press Release

Amiga is Back, and will change computing forever, again.

Amiga, the creators of Multi-Media computing, have announced the release of
their developer kit for Amiga, Linux, and Java developers.

June 3, 2000, Snoqualmie, WA - Amiga announces the release of the Amiga Software
Developers Kit, the first new product to introduce the next generation Amiga
platform.

The Amiga Software Developers Kit provides the initial tools and examples for
developers to create exciting multi-media content for multiple devices and
computing environments. The unique strength of the New Amiga comes from the
partnership with the Tao Group in Reading England providing a foundation where
developers are able to take advantage of a ubiquitous computing environment.

In 1984 Amiga established what is know today as multi-media. As a result of
this, Amiga systems are used around the world by leading film studios,
animators, and in mission critical applications. Using this as the foundation,
the Amiga is moving forward by creating multi-media for numerous devices and
computing environments in the home, in the office and beyond.

The Amiga OS is capable of being self-hosted, and sitting on top of other
operating systems. A single application is capable of running on X86, Power PC,
M.core, ARM, StrongArm, MIPs, SH3/4, and others. In a hosted environment the new
Amiga runs on versions of Linux, Windows 95,98/NT, Windows CE, OS/9, QNX4, and
others to be announced.

The new OS also embraces the Java language in a new, powerful and compliant way.
The intent Java Technology Edition from Tao is world renowned for its speed and
compact execution of Java applications. With the new environment, developers
will be able to take advantage of both Java, and portable assembler coding.

"Today we take the first step towards the future," said Bill McEwen,
President/CEO of Amiga, Inc. "The new Amiga SDK provides an environment where
the best developers in the world can build exciting applications, that can
transcend hardware limitations. Today Amiga developers can be joined by Linux
and Java developers in an environment that provides the foundation for the
delivery of future content."

"Tao has been talking for some time now about our developments to create Digital
Heaven(TM) and we see Amiga and its community as a fundamental part of the new
order that can make it happen and take an industry lead. With the sheer tenacity
and the many qualities of McEwen and his Amiga team, the world is going to see
Amiga as a Premier Brand for connected digital appliances," said Francis Charig
Chairman of the Tao-Group.

For the developer, the new SDK creates a single environment that is scalable
from handheld devices, such as cell phones upwards New versions of the kit later
in the year will introduce many new media features. Both the current and future
versions will enable compact, high performance and robust media solutions to be
used across a broad range of devices using identical binaries..

The New Amiga SDK is available through local retailers for $99.00, and from the
Amiga web site, Amazon.com and other sources available soon. A version via a
Japanese distributor will be announced shortly.

About Amiga:
Amiga Incorporated is dedicated to creating a multi-media operating environment,
enabling developers and users to experience a new level of enjoyment.

As it was in the early 80's, Amiga is ready to introduce the next level of
computing.

                        FREE AMIGA OCR PROGRAM AVAILABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Uffe Holst" <uhc@post6.tele.dk>

Hello everybody,

I was today directed to a site where a free OCR program is available -- well, at
least the source was available.

With minor changes I managed to compile it with SAS/C, and since many might have
use of such a program, I have made it publicly available.

The original site -- where you will find the source, documentation and other
stuff is:

     http://altmark.nat.uni-magdeburg.de/~jschulen/ocr/

And the Amiga executable is available here:

     http://home6.inet.tele.dk/uhc/gocr.lha

I have tested it with a couple of the files available at the original site, and
in my opinion it is quite good and even reasonably fast -- at least with a 060
processor. One test file, probably half a page of text, took only 65 seconds to
process.

I haven't studied its use of memory, but it is most probably quite huge. When
running it the first time it reported stack overflow (have apparently compiled
it with the StackCheck option) so I increased the stack (you know, by typing
Stack in the shell) to 1 MB (ie. 1000000 bytes in my case), and this worked
flawlessly, but a smaller stack size will probably work too. It might also very
well trash your memory as well as your harddisk, but I don't think the latter is
the case :-) Use it at your own risk.

I hope somebody can find use of it :-))) If you can find use of it, you can pay
me $300 for all my work :))) Okay, it is GPL, so use it for free.

It did. No problems at all. Not even a warning...

I don't need a OCR program at the moment, so I haven't done a complete test of

@node not06 "AMIGA MARKS ITS SIX-MONTH ANNIVERSARY WITH A MASSIVE PROGRESS REPORT"
      AMIGA MARKS ITS SIX-MONTH ANNIVERSARY WITH A MASSIVE PROGRESS REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello World:

Today is June 3, 2000, the six month anniversary of our first day of operation
as the proud new owners of Amiga.

When we got involved with Amiga, it was with the clear vision and goal that we
were going to change computing forever. That we were going to be able to create
an operating system that was scalable and would run on different platforms and
that hardware could evolve as quickly as possible, and that Amiga would be able
to take advantage of that, and not be limited by it.

I wanted to create long term partnerships with our developers and OEMs where we
could truly be partners and not competitors. That is being achieved by putting
into practice logical, common sense ideas, and working hard to succeed in
achieving our goal.

After an interesting twisting of events, we are here and everything that is
mentioned above we have the chance to obtain.

Many of you did not think that we would make it this far :) , Suffice to say we
are going to be here for a long, long time. It takes time to take over the
world, we are planning to do it one customer at a time, No, correct that, by
adding one more member to the Amiga family at a time.

As many of you already know, I sometimes get some depressing and rather
non-positive e-mails and recently I had one of those mornings where I was
inundated by hundreds of negative messages.

Someone in the community felt that they had been slighted, and they took their
grievance out into the public forum. Personally, I was feeling rather down
because no matter what I said or did it would not be reactive, instead of
pro-active. It was with this heavy attitude that I attended an impromptu meeting
with a group of visiting Japanese consumer electronics companies.

I had never met them before, but they had heard what we were doing, and they
remembered the Amiga fondly. After our presentation, one of the gentlemen sat
back, and informed me that what he had just heard, and saw was the most exciting
opportunity that he had seen in years, and that we were absolutely the correct
company for them to work with. What they had not told us until after that, was
that these three gentlemen were actually representing a group of over 50
consumer electronics companies, and they were looking for a long term partner!
Let's just say that they liked what they saw, and heard.

I left that meeting with a new attitude, Never Give Up, and Never Surrender.
wait,.... I think that someone else may have borrowed that. Ok, how about, I
will no longer accept that I must apologize for Amiga and neither should any of
you we do not need to apologize for being better.

Now we may not always do things that way, the way that "others" may think that
we should and we may not always get it right the first time, but we are moving
forward with our plans, and we will win !!

If you have friends that used to come to your user group meetings, call them. If
you have an extra Amiga not in use, please, do let a friend try one for the
first time. If you know places in your community where you can shine, then do
so.

The Amiga changed computing forever with the introduction of the A1000.

We are about to do it again.

Today we announce the release of the first product since our acquisition, the
Amiga Software Developers Kit. This is the first step in creating the content,
and applications that are going to change the way people look at computing. As
many of you are aware, what we are talking about goes well beyond turning on a
computer, and waiting, waiting, waiting, oh " @%!%! ", restart, waiting,
waiting, and then start our frustrating tasks.

No what we are talking about here, is creating a new and exciting computing
environment, where you turn on your machine and guess what?......its on.

The environment embraces the user, as opposed to the user being forced into a
certain method of doing things. And all the while we stay true to Amiga. As I
have been told many times before, Amiga just did it right. Now we will continue
that pledge to you.

Make no mistakes this product is truly for developers. This is not for people
looking for the next version of the Amiga. This is a developers kit, that
provides the tools, and starts developers on their education of writing VP code
and Java.

This is designed as a reference platform to get started, and there will be more
releases of the SDK over the coming months, as we add new features and expand
the AmiVerse.

In case you have not noticed, this is a change from the announcement in St.
Louis on April 1, 2000. We had originally planned to release a hardware and
software only solution, but we received so many comments, and emails, that we
listened to you and decided to take the time and launched a software version of
the developer release. Yes we listened.

We also have changed our plans on the hardware portion of the announcement also.
We had planned to be the sole source for the dev-box, but within hours of the
St. Louis show we have numerous companies coming forth saying that they could
build the developer boxes for less. So again, we listened and changed our plans.

We have gone with a regional approach now, and are finalizing the list of Amiga
Dev-Box companies authorized to sell an approved system.

These will be local companies in each of your areas, and this should also help
with support and warranty concerns.

Fleecy has been hard at work and has written an excellent document that offers a
glimpse into the SDK and the way that developers will be able to get the most
out of it in a short time.

You can read it in Amiga World, or in the developers support area of the site.

For those of you who think that we are sitting around, please note the
following:

Currently there are over a quarter of a million lines of code written for the
new version of Boopsi.

We call it BOOPS. It is in testing, and in the optimization stage and it shall
be ready for release very soon.

Also we are working very hard on a new scripting language, very similar to
AREXX, that we know that everyone will be able to enjoy. Portions are in test,
and there will be more about this development in the coming weeks also.

Also I am pleased to announce that Dean Brown has accepted our offer, and will
joining us full time, and is preparing to move his family to the "great white
north", another positive move.

We also have some other talented folks, but I am not at liberty to tell you
their names until after the first week of July.

We are also making a special announcement with some friends at Java One next
week, and I think that you will all be pleased to see and read more about that
then.

I am also very excited about the new AmigaTainment section of the web site being
introduced this week. This is where you will be able to see works in progress on
Amiga titles. These are all products being developed for the new Amiga OS, and
will be ready almost as fast as we will be.

For the Amiga dealers who have responded, and are planning on stocking the new
SDK, you will find their list in the dealer section of the web site. Please
support them, as they have continued to support Amiga.

We took over Amiga on January 3rd, 2000, and six months later we have delivered
on our promise to you, a new developer platform.

There will be more announcements and partnerships, changes to the web site and
developer updates over the coming months.

I know that our silence can be extremely frustrating and there are those people
who will try and take advantage of our silence, but I do not want us to
pre-announce and build false hope and expectations.

There was far too much of that activity in the past and we can no longer afford
to pay for those sins of the past. Let us all move forward together.

So my friends, today I am 38 years old. It is my birthday, and I could find no
better way to celebrate with you than this. Well, actually there are a couple,
but it does not involve Amiga.

I thank God for what we have accomplished so far, but this is truly only a small
glimpse of what it to come, we have set even greater goals.

Sincerely,

Bill McEwen, and the Amiga Team.

                AMIGA PARTNERS TO LAUNCH JAVA DEVELOPERS PORTAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Espial Joins with Technology and Media Innovators to Launch one of the First
Java(TM) Technology Developer Portals for Internet Smart Devices

Devicetop.com, supported by Sun, Intel, Motorola, Amiga, Tao Group, IAN,
Pointbase, Dr. Dobb's, Java Report, and JavaWorld.com(tm), Marks Portal Launch

June 5, 2000, JavaOne(SM) Conference, San Francisco - Espial, a market leader in
infrastructure software for the pervasive internet, today unveiled
Devicetop.com, an internet portal dedicated to Java (tm) technology developers
of Web content and application services for internet smart appliances.
Devicetop.com is poised to become a premier Internet destination for developers
interested in extending their programming skills from the PC desktop to post-PC
devices.

Devicetop.com is an initiative of Espial supported by Sun, Intel, Motorola,
Amiga, Tao Group, Internet Appliance Network (IAN), Pointbase, Java Report, Dr.
Dobb's, and JavaWorld.com (tm), to develop a vibrant community of third-party
developers focused on creating services for smart devices. The Devicetop.com
portal will be launched in conjunction with the JavaOne(SM) 2000 Developer
Conference in San Francisco, the premier global event for Java technology
developers.

According to a recent report from International Data Corporation (IDC), the
market for internet appliances is poised to explode over the next several years.
This market is expected to become an annual 55 million unit market and $15
billion market in the US by the year 2001. By 2002, shipments of consumer
internet appliances will exceed consumer PC shipments. The internet appliance
market includes handheld PDAs, wireless smartphones, internet screenphones, web
tablets, game consoles, in-car computing, and interactive TV set-top boxes. The
predicted explosion of the information appliance market and the Java platform
being viewed as the de facto standard for creating third-party developer
community and applications, means that a portal such as Devicetop.com will serve
as a catalyst for the growth of the information appliance market.

"The smart-device market is in a rapidly expanding stage, bringing with it
developments that promise to revolutionize the way we work and communicate on a
daily basis," states Mal Raddalgoda, senior director of strategic marketing at
Espial. "The opportunities for creating and developing smart-device services are
limitless and we want to help developers move quickly from the desktop to
devices. The Devicetop.com portal is the next step to achieving Espial's vision
of universal service management for smart devices where the combination of
service-enabled smart devices, the Internet, and a broad array of services for
devices will drive the deployment of a new generation of telecommunication
services."

                       RESURRECT COMP.SYS.AMIGA.ANNOUNCE?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Dan Zerkle" <zerkle@home.com>

Years ago, I was moderator of comp.sys.amiga.announce. I passed off the job to
someone else, who did the job for awhile, then disappeared without assigning a
new successor. The group has been dead ever since.

Would someone like to take over moderation duties and bring the group back to
life?

This is a serious commitment. Not just anyone can do it, and I don't want
someone else who will just let the group die again. However, this group once
made a real contribution to the Amiga community, and I believe that it can
again.

If you are interested in this job, read on.

Here are the duties of moderator:

Check for new posts daily. When they come in, either accept or reject them. If
you accept one, you must post it to the newsgroup. If you reject one, you must
return it with an explanation of why you rejected it.

Post the newsgroup documentation monthly. Keep it up-to-date. I can supply old
documentation for you to update.

(optional) Maintain the documentation on a Web site.

Monitor assorted newsgroups for moderators.

(optional) Maintain automated message processing software. This sorts out
messages from people who submit it, and can send them documentation. I will do
this at first.

Here are the qualifications for being moderator:

You must be an active member of the Amiga community. You must keep up with
current events as they happen, and therefore be able to understand the assorted
nuances of every post.

You must be an experienced user of Usenet. Despite the influx of the great
unwashed in recent times, there is a certain standard of behavior, here. You
should understand the history of Usenet and be ready to recite the important
documents on Usenet that explain how things are supposed to work.

You must be able to make a serious time commitment. That means approving posts
within a day of their arrival. That means sticking with it even if you have big
projects at work. Taking care of a newsgroup does require a certain amount of
time every day. It can get old. It can be a hassle. However, it's not fair to
the people submitting posts if you do not take care of them. This is where I
blew it originally, and why I passed on the mantle.

You must be technically savvy enough to deal with the assorted vagaries of
Usenet. The basics aren't hard, but some things will be easier to deal with if
you know a few tricks with computers.

You must have a strong command of the English language. Many people with Amigas
do not speak English as their native languages. You must be able to correct
their grammar and spelling before putting up their posts (note: This takes more
time than anything else).

Submitting Your Application:

If you would like to be the moderator of this group, please apply by e-mailing
me and explaining how you meet each of the five qualifications noted above.
Hint: For the second one, do recite.

I will try to pick someone within three weeks, and try to get him or her started
as moderator within a week after that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* FORMAT V44 IS SAFE

Martin Steigerwald (m.steigerwald@haage-partner.com) "I recently wrote about
DiskCopy V44 having problems with copying beyond partitions beyond 4GB limit. I
said Format might also have problems. Now after some tests I am quite sure:
Format V44 works as expected. I did not experience any >4GB problems. Just make
sure that the NSD patches are in place. Update to Boing Bag 1 since its
NSDPatch.cfg contains more lines for standard controllers. Generally there
should be a proper line with the name of the device of your harddisk controller
*uncommented* in this file."

* NEW MOVIESHOP FORUM

MovieShop users -- with VLab Motion or DraCo hardware -- are welcome to join
members of the ancient Videotec Listserv at its new eGroups home. To subscribe

* PHASE 5 IS SENDING CARDS BACK

According to Amiga-news.de, Gerald Carda is sending back cards send in for
repair by customers. The first cards have already reached their owners. It seems
that they are unrepaired, so you should send them to DCE for repairing. This is
the address to get your cards back:

     Wolf Dietrich und Gerald Carda
     phase5 digital products
     In der Au 27
     D-61440 Oberursel
     Germany

You should state when you did send in your card and the RMA number. Set an
apropriate deadline for recieving the hardware.

* WE DON'T NEED A COMPANY LIKE ALIVE MEDIASOFT

Alive Mediasoft have been accussed of pirating Amiga software. There are
reliable proofs of not paying Amiga developers like the author of Blade and
Darkage Software, and now it seems that the CD Goal 2000 only includes a cracked
version of the old Goal game. As a result, KDH Datentechnik have stopped the
distribution of Amiga games published and distributed by Alive Mediasoft.

* BLOODLINE NEARING COMPLETION

Dafel: Bloodline is now nearing completion. Pagan's featured packed RPG action
game is shaping up to be something special. A release date will be given soon
once confirmed with their publishers, Epic Marketing. More information at
http://www.pagan-games.com/

* AMIGA NEW HARDWARE REFERENCE FOR DEVELOPMENT

In c.s.a.misc Gary Peake said that the Dev system specs are: Super Socket 7
motherboard with an AGP 2x slot 128 megs of RAM, Soundblaster Live PCI card,
Matrox Dual Head G400 video card, 13 gig hard drive, Linksys NC100 network card
and AMD K6-2 (or 3) 400 mhz up.

In an interview for the german e-magazine "Amiga Future", Digital Dreams
Entertainment, authors of the great Wasted Dreams game, have stated that the
game before known as "Hell Pigs" and now as "Codename Hell Squad" will be
released in July. More information at http://www.dd-ent.com/.

* HERETIC 2 APPROVED FOR DISTRIBUTION

Hyperion's Heretic 2 port was approved for distribution after rigorous testing
by Activision and Ravensoft. The Amiga version running on a Cyberstorm PPC
200mhz and Cybervision PPC outperforms the Windows version running on the same
Permedia 2 with Pentium II 400 mhz.

Here's how this test was performed: According to Ravensoft's web page, they
played through level one. At the start of the level, they used the cheat to
bring up all weapons, and fired each weapon/spell. Then, they swam through the
harbour water, climbed out, and played through the first level.

Hyperion did the same test, and our result was about 18 fps, while the PC
version got 16 fps. It's a bit faster, and it shows that for the Pentium, the
Permedia 2 was the bottleneck. As a PPC Amiga (a 200 MHz 604e) outperforms the
PC version (K6/2 400 MHz) of Shogo (both using software rendering), by about 1 -
2 fps (depending on scene complexity), the Permedia 2 seems to slow down the
Amiga version as well.

         AMIGA PRESIDENT ADRESSES TRADEMARK ISSUES AND SDK AVAILABILITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Executive Update May 30,2000

Friends:

Many people have been writing to me recently, reminding me that there has been
very little activity as far as site updates go. While this is not intended as
the official Executive Update, I just want to make sure everyone knew that there
has, in fact, been a great deal of activity going on at Amiga since the Amiga 2k
show in Saint Louis a few months ago. As usual, there are things that we aren't
ready to discuss, but never mistake our silence for being "asleep".

Officially you can watch the Amiga.com site for the new Executive Update, new
developer and application information, as well as several other updates which
will be posted on June 3rd, 2000.

In the next Update, you can expect to see much more information and details
about our immediate plans than this message will have. While we could have
waited another week or so to post the next Update, I thought the community
needed to hear from us, to let you know what we can at the moment, and to ask
you to be patient, just a little bit longer.

One critical area that needs to be addressed right now today is the Amiga name,
trademarks, logos, and intellectual properties. Many of you have sent me notes
asking us to take action against those who are making illegal copies of our
software, using our name without permission, and the distributing our
intellectual property without our knowledge and consent.

While this might seem negative for many, it is imperative that Amiga properly
and legally defend our trademarks and intellectual property. To be blunt and to
the point, if you are using the Amiga name, Amiga logos, or distributing our
intellectual property without a license, you must cease and desist these actions
immediately. Amiga Incorporated owns the aforementioned items and all rights
contained therein.

We understand that many of you have worked very hard to maintain a community,
the spirit, and all we know Amiga as today. Unfortunately, there are many
people, sites, and even companies out there who are using the Amiga name in a
detrimental fashion, and in negative ways. Some have even sought to use the
Amiga name to further their own goals and products. Because of this and because
international trademark laws mandate it, we must make sure that anyone using our
name, logos, or trademarks in any fashion is properly licensed by us.

Okay, now that we've said that, here's the Amiga SDK (Software Developers' Kit)!

On April 1st, 2000, at the Amiga 2k show, Amiga Inc. announced the developer box
and our partnership with the TAO group in England. To be quite honest, the
number of developers who approached us at the show and shortly thereafter
wanting to purchase the Software Development Kit (SDK) separately from the
hardware to run on your own machines took us completely by surprise.

Well, we listened and in only a few days will be releasing to manufacture the
new Amiga SDK.

More information will be on the site the weekend of June 3rd.

Please note that the SDK will sell for $99 U.S.. The SDK will be available from
your Amiga retailer, and other sources soon-to-be announced.

Things really are happening at Amiga, there are new applications, new employees,
new partnerships, and new products.

The year 2000 truly is going to be a very exciting time. I look forward to
meeting with many of you over the coming months at the different trade shows,
different events, by phone, by fax, and by e-mail. I can promise you that with
the release of the SDK you'll begin to see Amiga get much more aggressive and
move much faster towards the future.

Thank you again for your continued support, and make sure to check the Amiga.com
site the weekend of June 3rd.

Sincerely,
Bill McEwen, and the rest of the Amiga team.

                         PAYBACK STATUS REPORT: PART XI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29 May 2000 - The Latest News

As usual, the bulk of the work done this month involved designing new missions.
However, a few additional improvements were also made to the game engine:

   - A fully functional title screen has been added.
   - The player can now load and save their game.
   - The game can now record and save replays. The file format is extremely
     efficient, consuming less than 4K of memory per minute when recording at
     30 frames per second.
   - The game also went into the initial phases of beta-testing this month.
     Here's what one of the playtesters had to say:
      - "Oh man, this game is really cool. It doesn't seem to crash, either. :)"
      - "Great car controls...Nice weapons, excellent explosions, good looking
        pedestrians, a lot more '3D' than GTA 1 or 2."
      - "The most important bit is the car handling, and it's very good."
      - "Overall, it's brilliant. With some more speed and polish, this could
        easily beat GTA." (Note: I'm now in the process of adding 'more speed
        and polish' :)
      - "PS. I really didn't expect it to play so well. Well done, man. :)"
   - An on-screen health gauge has been added.
   - Lots of bugs have been fixed, and the gameplay has been extensively tweaked
     according to the beta-testers demands.
   - The performance of the vehicles now decreases when they get damaged.

Well, that's it for this time. See you next month!

@node not15 "AROS UPDATE"
                                  AROS UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla, digulla@sowatec.com

Hello,

There was no status update for more than 6 weeks (which is too much). I'll do
better in the future :-) In the last few days, our WWW counter silently skipped
33.333 hits.

The Sowatec AG has decided to give AROS a chance. Several people who applied for
the job to work on AROS have been contacted to arrange for job interviews. That
means for me that I will finally be able to meet some of the people I worked
with for the last five years ;-) It doesn't mean that there will be an AROS
development team in Switzerland, though. So don't hope for too much, yet :-)

Unfortunately, the date for the World of Alternatives is very unlucky for me;
I'll return from my holidays on Saturday and therefore, I'll not be able to
attend :-( Since the World of Amiga in Cologne seems to be a dead event this
year (Who's left to attend ? Who is willing to attend ??) I'll try to make it
the London Amiga show or whatever is held this or early next year. Sorry if you
did expect me to show up :-)

On a more happy news, BGUI has been handed over to us and integrated into AROS
(you can download the contrib sources for your copy). Manuel Lemus promised me
that it compiles on Amiga but, unfortunately, it doesn't compile on AROS, yet
(the old lack-of-manpower problem). There should be no major problems, though
and porting has started. I just can't say when it will be finished. Anyone
wanting to work on BGUI only (and not on AROS) should still apply for a CVS
account to synchronise his work with ours.

Also, Steve Crietzman of the Open Amiga Foundation seems to be pretty far with
finding out which legal obstacles could hurt AROS/Lite. His effort is currently
blocked by the effort of the Sowatec AG to found an AROS development team (we'll
have to sort our legal obstacles first). As usual, the legal dept. drains all
the energies ;-)

On the AROS side, work is still progressing, maybe even at a faster pace than
usual ;-) The AROS Native/i386 flavour is currently broken (the HIDD system has
been greatly enhanced and Michael Schulz currently cannot take care of it) but
AROS Linux/i386 works quite fine. Nils has committed a couple of patches which
greatly enhance the speed of the graphics output (it's now *much* faster then on
the WoA in Cologne last year in November). Right now, bugs in the build system
and exec are hunted by various AROS developers and I hope to see lots of
progress in that area when I return from my holidays.

As for the survey which I started months ago, I hope I can summarize them after
the holidays :-)

Things never turn out what you expect them,

                    AMIDOG PORTS MAME AND MESS TO AMIGA PPC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since there were no recent Amiga port of MAME and MESS, Mathias "AmiDog" Roslund
decided to make his own ones. These first releases do lack a lot of options
which the DOS version has got, but the most important ones like AGA and CGFX
support and well as sound (using audio.device) is included.

The MAME port is based on MAME v0.37b2. There is no need to unpack the ziped
game files you may find, just place them in roms and MAME will unpack them while
loading. There is also a NeoGeo only compile of MAME, called NeoMAME, to be
downloaded.

The MESS port is based on MESS v0.37b2. IMPORTANT: Remember to specify CARTRIDGE
when using systems which requires a cartridge, like the Genesis, or MESS will
crash. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.

                              FUSION PPC GOES IMAC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fusion Amiga News!

Good news! H&P has come through (yet again) and fixed the MMU stack problem that
we were encountering. Now, as long as we don't run into any other OS related
issues, you should start counting the days before FUSION-PPC is released for
your Amiga!

Now, the great news!!

During the course of waiting for OS fixes, and other significant delays, we have
completely changed the emulation foundation. So, what does this mean to you? It
means that you are going to get a superior emulation, and one that will NOT
require a Macintosh ROM!

Superior?? How?? You will have an iMac emulation! Yes, that is right, the latest
technology from Apple Computer, Inc. at your finger tips!

On a personal note... it has been very disappointing to us that even though we
obtained more than 1,000 pledges for this product's development, approximately
1/4 of the people actually pre-paid. Our agreement with Blittersoft, and the
public was that if 500 (or more) pre-payments were obtained, we would complete
this project in 60 days. We would dump all of the money into additional people
to insure that this product would become are realty, making our profits from the
people that purchased FUSION-PPC at the full retail price. Since this did not
occur, Blittersoft was willing to offset the difference, but legally we could
force this issue, and did not want any type of problem with our working
relationship with Blittersoft should something happen where the project could
not be completed.

So, since we did not hire the extra people to help finish this project, and we
needed to have people working on the PC stuff, it turned this 60 day project for
15 people into a project that simply takes forever with only 1 person working on
it.

Because of this, and several other reasons, we have sold our 68K emulation
technology for the PC, and are now dedicating all of our man power into the
Amiga version of PPC so that it is completed. We apologize for the delay,
however, had we known that people would not actually pre-order, as they promised
they would, we would have never developed for the Amiga again. We want to keep
to our word, and develop a PowerPC emulation for the Amiga, so we are now
pulling out all of the stops to get it done.

From: Oliver Wagner <owagner@vapor.com>

Hi,

as you can probably guess, Alina is keeping both me and Claudi quite busy, 24

However, I've uploaded a snapshot of the improved image decoders to the mirror
sites (see http://v3.vapor.com/ for download links)

Olli

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V³ Image Decoders with F-S Dithering for GIF

Update 12.5

This image decoder updates fix a problem with PNG tRNS (transparency) and alpha
channel images.

They also provide numerous low-level optimizations in the assember subroutines
used for chunky2planar and rgb-tripplet expansion.

Update 12.1

This is a beta snapshot of the V³ Image Decoders with support for
Floyd-Steinberg Dithering for rendering GIF images on CLUT (8 bit and less)
screens.

To activate the dithering, you need to set the dithering options in the V³
"Images" pref section to "Floyd-Steinberg".

The dithering implementation uses the real on-screen RGB palette values to
calculate the error values, similiar to how V³ handles JPEG already, so it does
not rely on ObtainBestPen() and it's inherent relationship to the phase of the
moon or nearby lylines.

Individual dithering settings for the various image types and support for
dithering of PNG images will follow.

AJE is a project to port the JAVA Engine to the AmigaOS organized by Merlancia
Industries. It seemed that this was impossible afte the cancellation of the
Merapi and Daytona projects.

Merlancia Industries are currently looking for developers who are interested in
helping with the AJE project. Developers must be willing to share sources with
other developers to continue the AJE momentum, and must sign a Confidentiality /
Non-Disclosure agreement with Merlancia Industries.

After a developed JVM is available, we will begin private Beta testing with
people experienced in coding JAVA applets and applications. Private Beta testers
will be required to sign Confidentiality / Non-Disclosure agreements with
Merlancia Industries.

On the other hand, Merlancia Industries is currently looking into Public Beta
Releases. If such releases are made available, anyone who is interested can
become a Public Beta tester. PBTs will be required to register and may not
re-distribute the binary code provided to them, nor can they de-compile it into
source.

Developers and 1st Phase Beta Testers are eligible to receive final AJE product
when it is made available at no charge as a consideration to their efforts.
Public/2nd Phase Testers do not qualify for this promotion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: John Zacharias <jzachar@calweb.com>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Preliminary list of exhibitors at AmiWest 2000 announced!

A preliminary list of companies and clubs that are either participating in or
exhibiting at AmiWest 2000 has been posted on our web page at
http://www.sacc.org/amiwest/

AmiWest 2000 is the west coast all Amiga show which is being produced in
Sacramento, California, at the popular Holiday Inn, Sacramento NorthEast, 5321
Date Avenue Sacramento, CA 95841, on Saturday, July 29th and Sunday, July 30th,
2000. The Holiday Inn venue proved to be such a hit for last year's show that we
are again holding it there.

Show times are Saturday 10am-5pm and Sunday 10am-4pm.

AmiWest is in it's third year and is the only all Amiga show produced on the
West Coast. The show has proved very popular for Amiga enthusiasts in the
Western United States.

This preliminary list of exhibitors includes AEMail, which produces an email
client for the Amiga; Amiga, Inc., the producers of the Amiga; AntiGravity,
which makes the BoXer; AudioLabs, producers of stunning audio software for the
Amiga; Compuquick Media Center, an Amiga dealer coming all the way from Ohio;
FWD Computing, selling CD-ROMS for the Amiga; G & G Publications, producers of
"The New Amigans" Amiga publication; Hyperion Entertainment Software, producing
game software for the Amiga; Merlanica Industries, another Amiga dealer coming
from Arizona; Nordic Global Inc., developers of the "Miami" and "Miami Deluxe"
TCP/IP stack software for the Amiga; Nova Designs, Inc., makers of "ImageFX"
(image processing software) and "Aladdin 4D" (3-D rendering software); the
Sacramento Amiga Computer Club (SACC); and the User Group Network (UGN), the
world-wide Amiga network of user groups which will be conducting an IRC directly
from the AmiWest 2000 show floor.

We are adding new exhibitors daily. Watch our web site for the latest updates.

If you are interested in exhibiting at AmiWest 2000, please submit the form that
is provided on our web page. We need to know early who will be exhibiting. Booth
sizes and pricing are now posted. Special booth pricing will be available for
user groups.

In April at the A2K show in St. Louis, the newly reorganized Amiga, Inc
announced many advances in the three short months since the purchase of the
Amiga by Amino (renamed Amiga, Inc.) from Gateway. The Amiga appears to have a
new life that is definately on an upswing. The new Amiga Corporation is headed
by Bill McEwen who can be remembered by participants at both AmiWest'98 and
AmiWest'99 as a very enthusiastic supporter of the Amiga. Also part of the Amiga
team are long time Amigans Fleecy Moss and Petro Tyschtschenko.

Strategic alliances have been formed with such well known names in the computing
world as Tao-Group, Red Hat, and Corel. In addition partnerships have been
formed with well known Amiga companies such as Haage & Partner, Hyperion, and
Epic Marketing. All of these companies will be producing software for the new
Amigas.

After what has transpired in three months, four more months should bring many
more announcements from Amiga, Inc. at AmiWest 2000.

You can learn more about AmiWest 2000 by accessing our web page at:

     http://www.sacc.org/amiwest/

This weekend event will again showcase the progress that IS the Amiga Community.

               INFORMATION ABOUT FOUNDATION THE UNDISCOVERED LAND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need the original "Foundation" or better "Foundation Directors Cut" to
play this game. Have you played through all 40 missions of Paul Burkeys great
RTS game "Foundation"? You want to play new and more challenging missions in
"Foundation"? Well, here is your chance: "Foundation Mission CD: The
Undiscovered Land" comes to the Amiga. The Mission CD not only comes with a
bucketfull of new and challenging missions but also improves on the original
Foundation in various ways. Just take a look at the Feature list below:

games features:

   - 40 new missions, each with rendered intro screens just like the original
     levels.
   - The original missions are also included with some small changes and
     improvements.
   - New mission objectives, more variety and some levels include already setup
     villages.
   - More technology to research including faster mining, faster chopping,
     better fishing, improved shielding, Better health care in Hospital,
     improved faith in Church etc.
   - Optimized gameplay speed for smoother action. Game Loading times are much
     shorter.
   - Visual 'energy display' for selected people (small bar over the head)
     showing the health of many people quickly. This 'energy display' system is
     also used on Buildings.
   - More Keyboard shortcuts added, including buttons for most building types
     and for locating unused people. Extra buttons are added to the user
     interface for some bonus features.
   - The Vegetables resource has been removed to cut down on the number of
     resources you need to gather. It also reduces the amount of transportation

                      ENFORCE DEMO NOW AVAILABLE IN AMINET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 1998, the Czech Amiga developers Insanity released an astonishing demo of
Enforce, a fast 3D shooter. The used 68k 3D mapping code is still the fastest I
have seen in a game.

Unfortunately, as it usually happened (and still happens), the project was
canceled time ago, so the author has released two demo versions of the game
along with the last beta version of the engine, which are available on Aminet.

The first demo requires 68040+, OS 3.0+, AA, 8MB fast, being the recomended
system 68060/66Mhz in CSPPC & CVPPC, OS 3.5, CGX 4.2. The demo, unfortunately,
don't run, while using hicolor shadows mapping, under Picasso96 RTG system, only
under CyberGraphX. CGX v4.2+ recommended.

Download this demo at
ftp://se.aminet.net/pub/aminet/game/demo/Enforce_demo01.lha

The second demo supports Warp3D which add speed and possible use of high
resolutions even on 68k cpu. The demo, unfortunately, don't run under Picasso96
RTG system, only under CyberGraphX. Its unlikely that will work on CyberVision3D
card in Zorro2, because ATM CGX allows there still only 1MB of texture memory.
And into 1MB of memory don't fits even the textures for smallest room... (don't
forget four mippmap levels for each one and also doubleburrering of whole
screen...)

The second demo requires 68040+, OS 3.0+, AHI v4+, AA, 20MB fast, being the
recomended system 68060/66Mhz, CSPPC & CVPPC, OS 3.5, AHI v4+, CGX 4.2 and
Warp3D 3.0.

                         CLICKBOOM S-FILES: SPRING TIME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's been a little while since I have given you all an update, but I do have a
really good excuse - I have been play testing Nightlong ;-)

Before we send our games to beta testers for final testing, we of course do our
own internal play testing, and I always get to do my share, too. Therefore, I
can say first hand that Nightlong is another excellent game from clickBOOM. You
may think I am a little biased when it comes to our games, but I am sure you
will agree with me once you get your copy.

Nightlong is a huge game and it will keep you busy and entertained for a quite
some time. There is so much to see and do. I originally started testing it
without using the walkthrough, and that's a lot of fun because I am actually
playing the game as you guys would. But, Nightlong is really big, and it took me
a long time to get half way through the game (I won't tell you how long), so for
the second half I had to use the walkthrough, or else I'd never finish my share
of testing. :) But even with the walkthrough, it's a lot of fun, and it still
took me a long time to finish it. So you are in for a really nice treat!

Speaking of size, we hardly managed to squeeze everything onto 3CDs! This is
because we wanted to give you an option of watching either large or small size
movies. Large is appropriate for PPC and 060 systems with fast CD-ROM, while
small size is for 040 and 030. Then, in the middle of all of that it turned out
the installer would have to be on CD2 because CD1 was almost full. Oooops. But,
finally, it's all squeezed and the game fits on ``just'' 3 CDs, and the
installer is on CD1, as expected. :)

We also tested Nightlong on OS3.5, and it works great.

I know you would all like to hear an exact shipping date, but let's will wait
until we get the response from the beta testers, and then I will let you know.

We thank everyone who preordered Nightlong. They say "good things come to those
who wait", well Nightlong definitely confirms this. Speaking of preordering,
sadly we did not even get 200 PPC preorders. :(

I also have a small update on Z for you. We have been receiving so many letters
about Z with concern over whether we are still going to convert it to the Amiga.
The answer is ``Yes, of course''! We are sorry that it is late but due to
internal rescheduling Nightlong took priority. At the moment Z is about 50%
finished, with the toughest parts behind us. The original is written in assembly
for PC, so converting it to Amiga is a tough job.

Finally, I just want to say you should all read the next issue of Amiga Future
(Germany). They will have a 3 page spread on clickBOOM and an interview with
myself. :))) In this interview I am addressing Riven and other questions, but
most importantly there is some exclusive news that I am sure you will want to
find out about :-)

And that about wraps up all the important happenings lately. We also got an
email with a notorious ``I love you virus''. The email was from Bill McEwen of
Amiga, I guess they got infected there by using Microsoft software. We didn't,
of course. :)

Before I go, I wish everyone a terrific Spring! We have been having some nice
warm weather here in Toronto, and I hope it's nice where ever you might be.

                                                                   Best regards,
                                                                           Sofia

Awards
Bob Scharp - bscharp@icon-stl.net - Amiga 2k organizer

Stockholm, Sweden - Sunday, May 14, 2000.

The 1999 USA AAA Awards were presented at the Amiga 2k show in St. Louis, April
1-2 2000. The first USA AAA Awards went to Kermit Woodall (Community) and
SoftLogik Publishing (Product). Please accept our sincere apologies for this
late announcement.

We hope to provide you with photo coverage of the event soon, available at
www.aaa-awards.org/winners/1999.php.

The Community award

The AAA Award USA - Community 1999 went to Kermit Woodall of Nova Design. He was
selected the greatest 1999 US Amiga personality by the US Amiga community in the
public voting.
The motivation given was:

     "For being an inspiration to the US Amiga community, with never failing
     commitment, by attending shows, involvement in initiatives such as ICOA
     and the AAC, and always giving appreciated support to the community and
     dealers."

The Product Award

This year also marked the launching of the first Product awards. The AAA Award
USA - Product 1999 went to SoftLogik Publishing, represented by owner Deron
Kazmaier. Their DTP package PageStream 4 was selected the best US Amiga product!
The exact motivation given by the jury was:

     "Best product released for the Amiga, and certainly the best publishing
     package available in it's price performance class. SoftLogik has been a
     rock in the Amiga community, developing good products like PageStream for
     many years. It is without doubt that Amiga would not be able to hold even
     the position it does today, without products like PageStream 4."

Still to come...

...is the AAA Award International, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom! Please
check our homepage www.aaa-awards.org for up-to-date information on where &
when.

        TITAN AND HYPERION BRING ALIEN NATIONS FROM JOWOOD TO THE AMIGA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Titan and Hyperion are pleased to announce that they will be bringing "Alien
Nations" ("Die Völker") to the Amiga after Titan succesfully negotiated a
license for an Amiga port from the Austrian developer Jowood.

Alien Nations is a real-time strategy game in the vein of "The Settlers", which
was enthusiastically received by the German speaking public and press. The game
is set on an alien planet inhabited by three very distinct races: the Pimmons,
the Amazons and the Sajikis and features campaigns consisting of 10 single
player missions per race, set against a giant 3D back-drop. Resource-management,
diplomacy, research, commerce and battle are key to success. The Amiga version
will most likely require a graphics card and will support PPC accelerators
through WarpOS although the feasibility of a 68060 version will be examined.
Optional 3D acceleration will be supported through Warp3D. Release is expected
during Q3 of 2000.

"We are very pleased to be able to extend our Amiga line-up to include a
RTS-game.", says Ben Hermans, managing partner of Hyperion. "With this deal, our
relationship with Titan has entered a new stage, with Titan acquiring the
license for Mac and Amiga and Hyperion doing the actual Amiga port. It's a model
we hope to repeat in the future."

More information on Alien Nations coming soon.

@node not28 "EYETECH ANNOUNCES THE AVAILABILITY OF TAO/ELATE DEVELOPER SYSTEMS"
       EYETECH ANNOUNCES THE AVAILABILITY OF TAO/ELATE DEVELOPER SYSTEMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you may know, Amiga Inc recently announced the specification of the new
Developer System for porting existing - and developing new - applications to run
under the new Amiga OS, itself built on top of TAO's real time OS kernel, Elate.

Elate is currently available on a number of processors - including x86 and
PowerPC - and is also available as a 'hosted' OS (at about 50% efficiency) under
Linux - and this is the environment to be used for the Developer System.

The Blizzard PPC/xVision version still needs some fine tuning - currently being
undertaken by Haage & Partner - but is expected to be released in a couple of
months. On its release this (PPC/xVision) software will form the main upgrade
path for the current 'classic' Amiga user, whils st maintaining compatibility
with 680x0-based software.

The purpose of the Developer System is to give a 'quick-start' to individuals or
organisations wishing to port or develop new applications under Elate, before
testing them on/releasing them for the PPC/xVision hardware.

Eyetech's EZPC Developer System has been specially designed to make the Elate
porting/development environment as productive as possible. Its main features
are:

   - EZPC-Tower system
      - 250W universal 90-250V PSU capable of taking a PC/Linux motherboard
      - A1200 with PPC and BVision graphics card

   - Elate development environment based on the Amiga developer system
     specification - ie
      - AMD 500MHz cpu
      - 64MB 100MHz memory
      - Nvidia GeForce 256 DDR AGP graphics card
      - Soundblaster-compatible 3D sound card
      - 8.4GB hard drive (other sizes available - please ring)
      - 10/100MHz ethernet card
      - CDReWriter with CDROM functions
      - PC mouse, mains lead etc
      - Linux O/S & Elate for Linux development environment

   - A1200/Developer System integration environment, including:
      - Eyetech 5-click SAMBA installer for the Amiga and SAMBA configuration
        guide for Linux
      - KMON/SMON keyboard & monitor switcher to swick between the Amiga/PPC and
        the Linux-based development system
      - BMON video switcher to switch the monitor between the BVision and 'AGA'
        Amiga video outputs
      - PCMCIA ethernet card, CC_RESET fix voucher and crossed UTP ethernet
        cable
      - PC Keyboard
      - Amiga PC Keyboard adapter
      - Internal EZVGA scandoubler/flickerfixer Mk2

Optionally Eyetech can also supply the system with a new Amiga A1200
motherboard, with PPC/680x0 accelerator, BVision graphics card, hard drive,
CDROM & TCP/IP stack preinstalled. Alternatively they can also install/integrate
your existing A1200 hardware into the EZPC Developer System. Finally they can
offer upgrade paths for existing EZTower (not-Z4 Tower) owners for £100 less
than the prices below (no EZPC-Tower, keyboard or PC keyboard adapter included).
Ring for details on these and other options.

  2. We all know what a great game Virtual Grand Prix is well Palolo Cattani
     (the guy who wrote it) has added some updates. There is new season
     information and car detail. There is also a 1999 and 2000 season update
     from Nico Barbat. You can find the information and download them at
     http://www.epic-direct.co.uk/amiga/newpage/vgp_download.html. If you have
     not got Virtual Grand Prix

     Classic Amiga, check it out at http://www.amiga.com.

  5. Although we run a Web based Amiga company it can still be hard to know all
     the sites that are out there covering the Amiga, so I was quite surprised
     when I found Amiganet.com (http://www.amiganet.com). This site is really a
     place where you can post information about yourself and your Amiga setup,
     but you can also see what other people are using, so you could find a
     friend we a similar spec or setup and exchange info. I thought this was a
     great idea for a site and well worth a mention.

@node not30 "AROS IS NOT DEAD"
                                AROS IS NOT DEAD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla <digulla@sowatec.com>

Someone posted a message to the AROS-User list mentioning that AROS is dead and
that Amiga doesn't do anything, etc (the usual "I'm unhappy and I want everyone
else to be unhappy, too").

Facts:

   - AROS is not dead. We are currently working on forming a professional, payed
     development team which will work at least part time on AROS. This should
     allow us to finish the work much more quickly. I cannot promise that this
     will really happen but that will be decided on Thursday, the 11th of May
     (next week). I will post here ASA I know something new.

   - I'm in close contact with Amiga and we're bouncing ideas forth and back how
     Amiga and AROS could work together or how AROS could get into a stable
     legal state. Most of these ideas did turn out to be unusable and therefore
     we're not discussing them in the public. Otherwise, there would be a lot of
     havoc and disruption.

   - I'm also in close contact with OAF. AROS and OAF have separated again
     because our mutual goals were no longer compatible. Basically, OAF wants a
     version of AROS under GPL which would allow them to work with FSF and other
     open source organizations which require this. His problem ATM is to find
     out which parts of AROS infringe copyrights, trademarks and patents and to
     find out how he can work around these.

AROS itself will try to move closer to Amiga because then we can get support
from them, we can help Amiga companies to make their old apps work on AROS, we
will get legal protection from Amiga, etc.

I cannot say if either attempt has an advantage over the other. All I can say is
that both make sense and since it's not clear which is better, both should be
tried. May the better win :-)

Hello and welcome to the 22nd issue of AmiChannel News.

If you have Internet access and a lot time to spend, probably you have read the
last Amiga World issue. In ase you do not know what I am writing about, Amiga
World is the official newsletter from Amiga Inc. and it is freely available from
the Amiga Inc. website at http://www.amiga.com/.

Well, first of all, I am not of this kind of people who complains about which
programs to use for doing a website. I do not mind if an Amiga website is done
with Frontpage or HotMetal, but is is ridiculous to do it with Word. I mean,
once you write the document in Word, the HTML version of it has lots of junk.
So, altough its size is about 100K actually its ASCII size is less than 5K or
less. Where is the simplicity?

Anyway, the big news of the month is the release of the Amiga SDK (= Software
Development Kit). It was promised by the notorious Jeff Schindler and Jim
Collas, nut neither of them was able to deliver, but fortunately, Bill McEwen
could.

Returning to the Amiga World issue, Fleecy Moss wrote a very interesting article
about the "Amiga Foundation Layer". Although it is very big, it is worth the
reading.

The most interesting point of the article is when Fleecy talks about memory
protection (MP for short). If an Operating System has this feature, the machine
will not reset when an application crash. Modern and old OS have this feature,
and probably you already know that AmigaOS 3.5 does not have it and if someone
implements it there will not be backwards compatibility.

The problem is that the new Amie or whatever they are going to call to the new
AmigaOS, will not have MP. Fleecy explains that this is because he thinks the
MP has to be at the software level, so if you want MP you should write your
programs in Java and the godd code should not be penalized by the bad code.
Anyway, I feel that another is the reason.

The Tao's Elate, the layer behind the Amie, came from the mobile phones and
wireless applications where a MMU (Memory Management Unit) is not available. So
it does not have MP and it is not possible to implement this feature outside
the kernel.

Although people from Amiga stated that this feature could be implemented in the
future, I am afraid that it will not be easy and there is not guaranteed that
the old applications will still work.

That's everything I wanted to say. Remember to visit the SAUG website, which is
located in:

	http://www.saug.org/

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

	noticias@saug.org

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.
