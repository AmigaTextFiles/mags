@{FG Shine}Welcome to AmiChannel News@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 0 issue of @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}

What is @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}? It is an electronic magazine dedicated to our favourite
platform, @{B}Amiga@{UB}. @{I}"Oh no, another e-mag!" @{UI}, you'll exclaim. No, not another. This
is  the  magazine ONE. It is true that exists a few of them and some of them are
sincerely  good, but this one is mainly oriented to News, and the other you know
are lacking of this.

@{B}AmiChannel  News@{UB}  was born by an idea of @{I}Victor Garcia Valero @{UI}, co-publishing of
the best e-Mag in spanish (and the only one!) called @{B}Amiga Channel@{UB} and therefore
we can consider this one as the big sister of the one you're reading. In fact, I
hope in the next issues of this magazine we could include some selected articles
from  @{B}Amiga Channel@{UB}. To do this I can count with the invaluable collaboration of
@{I}Alvaro  Morales @{UI} ( alias  @{I}Newton @{UI})  who  makes  the translations of the texts in
spanish to english. Without him, this magazine couldn't exist (thanks man!)

This  magazine  has  born  not only to serve to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Community all over the
world, but also we wish to make notice about the existence of @{B}Amiga@{UB} in Spain and
Sud-America, after all '@{B}Amiga@{UB}' is a spanish word.

This  effort is a small part of the effort which is making @{B}S.A.U.@{UB} (@{B}Spanish Amiga
Users@{UB}),  to  help to keep and expand the @{B}Amiga@{UB} market. Our fundamental objective
is  to  support  to  the  spanish-speaking  community, but we also think that is
necessary  to  contribute  to  this hard work. For this sake, @{B}S.A.U.@{UB} keeps a Web
site  where  you'll  be  able to find last hour news about @{B}Amiga@{UB} World. The main
web of @{B}S.A.U.@{UB} can be found here:

	@{B}http://www.arrakis.es/amiga/@{UB}                (Spain)

and it keeps four mirrors:

	@{B}http://club.idecnet.com/~dragon/sau/@{UB}        (Spain)
	@{B}http://soporte.databasedm.es/amiga/sau/@{UB}     (Spain)
	@{B}http://www.isocanda.org/per/sau/@{UB}            (Academic Net)
	@{B}http://www.larevisteria.com/sau/@{UB}            (California, USA)

Don't doubt to visit us. You won't be sorry.

Finally,  to  be  the  first issue is more than enough. We let you with the news
which have happened during April.

Greetings.

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/04/01@{FG Text}

We  must  apologize to all of our dealers for the time it took to get our dealer
page  up and running. As the largest @{B}Amiga@{UB} dealer for parts and chips we feel we
are  now  in  a position to fill our customer's needs and still have significant
inventory  to  sell our dealers worldwide. We are offering significant discounts
to  dealers  on  @{B}Phase 5@{UB}, @{B}Apollo/ACT@{UB} and @{B}Micronik@{UB} Classic Towers. Take a look at
our  dealer web pages, you will not be disappointed and we are trying to add new
dealer prices every few days.

We  would  like  to  draw  your  attention  to  the  fact that @{B}Paxtron@{UB} is now an
authorized  direct  service  center  for  @{B}Amiga  International@{UB}. Recently we have
opened  up  our repair facility to dealers with a 24 to 36 hour turnaround time.
We  believe  our  prices  are  more than fair and we invite all @{B}Amiga@{UB} dealers to
compare our prices and our rapid turn around time.

To keep our dealers up to date we have initiated the following programs.

 * Our  telemarketing sales department will be contacting all dealers once every
   four  to  six  weeks.  The purpose of this call is to bring the dealers up to
   date  on  pricing  and deals for the month. Orders may also be placed at that
   time.
 * We  have  contracted  with  a fax service to send flyers to our dealers every
   four  to  six  weeks. These flyers will contain all the latest dealer pricing
   and notes of interest to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} dealers.

To  have  access to the dealer pages and dealer pricing, please fax @{B}Paxtron@{UB} your
letterhead  and your request for dealer status at the following fax number (914)
578-6550 or call us directly on our toll free number (800) 595-5534.

@{FG Shine}@{B}MYSTIQUE@{UB} ANNOUNCES CREATION OF NEW FOLDER ON @{B}AMINET@{UB} JUST FOR CHILDREN@{FG Text}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/04/07@{FG Text}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

As  hosts of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s Premier Children's Site, it brings us great pleasure to
announce  the  completion  of  Stage  Two  of  our  @{B}Made  For  KiDS@{UB} campaign for
Children's Software on the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

We  have  overseen  the  creation  of  a  new  folder  on  the @{B}Aminet@{UB} solely for
children's  software and have introduced a brand new Kids' Software Directory on
our site.

This  new  directory  is  divided into several different categories and has been
carefully designed to provide you with the information you want with the maximum
of ease and minimum of fuss.

It really is the best way to find software for your children on the internet!

Features of the directory:

 * Comprehensive  Reviews:  Read  a  quality review of a title before taking the
   time to download it!
 * Screenshots
 * System Compatibility Information

 * RAM Requirements
 * Graphics Modes Supported
 * @{B}Workbench@{UB} Versions Supported
 * CPUs Supported
 * Languages Supported (Default is English)

 * Age  Ranges:  Don't  waste  time downloading software that's too easy/hard to
   use!
 * Local  Downloads:  Covering  the  entire  planet,  courtesy of the incredible
   @{B}Aminet@{UB} archives!

We believe this new format to be a great enhancement over the @{B}Aminet@{UB}'s format as
it is specifically designed to help you get the best, most suitable software for
your children.

The creation of this directory has taken a considerable amount of time and shows
our commitment to children's software on the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

Check out our website for even more pages for kids including:

 * Web  Forum: Make your voice heard on the future of children's software on the
   @{B}Amiga@{UB}.
 * Original Stories: For children to read online or download to read later!
 * @{B}Made  For KiDS@{UB}: Full details of the @{B}Made For KiDS@{UB} campaign including its aims
   and objectives and details about how you can help!

We  would  like to thank @{I}Urban Mueller @{UI}for his support and work in creating this
new folder.

@{I}Urban, @{UI}we couldn't have done it without you - keep up the great work!

We  would  also like to express our thanks to @{B}Haage&Partner@{UB} who have shown their
support  for  our  projects  by  generously  sponsoring  us  of  a copy of their
excellent @{B}StormC@{UB} software to aid our developments.

This, in conjunction with the sponsorship of our company by @{B}Amiga International@{UB},
shows  the  overwhelming  support for Mystique and for our efforts to ensure the
future of the @{B}Amiga@{UB} as a computer of choice for children and education.

Finally, we would also like to announce the opening of the new @{B}CP@{UB} Support Site.

Here you will find information about, screenshots, reviews and downloads of @{B}CP@{UB} -
the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s Premier Children's Software. Surely a section of the site you can't
afford to miss!

We  would  be very grateful if you could please complete our short Survey on the
future  specs  of  @{B}CP@{UB}, so that we may identify the base configuration for @{B}CP@{UB} and
better serve your child's computing needs!

All the best...

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/04/14@{FG Text}

@{I}PRESS RELEASE @{UI}

@{B}Amiga Forever 2.0@{UB} is finally available!

Suggested Retail Price                               DM 119.00

US$1.00 = DM 1,81 given today's exchange rates!

@{I}Ordering information: @{UI}

The  most  convenient  method of placing an order is to use our electronic order
form  located  at  @{B}http://www.schatztruhe.de/order.html@{UB}.  You  can  also send an
E-Mail  to  @{I}stefano@schatztruhe.de @{UI} including  your address and the products you
wish to order.

@{B}Amiga  Forever  2.0@{UB} finally began shipping this week. We would like to thank all
customers for their interest and patience in waiting for this release.

@{B}Amiga  Forever 2.0@{UB} includes state of the art software to satisfy two major needs
of  many  @{B}Amiga@{UB} users: to share data between @{B}Amiga@{UB} and other systems, and to use
their  existing  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  software  and  data on non-@{B}Amiga@{UB} hardware. Additionally,
software,  tutorial  and  reference files are included which are likely to be of
interest to any @{B}Amiga@{UB} enthusiast.

@{B}Amiga Forever@{UB} includes hundreds of pages of documentation in HTML and AmigaGuide
formats,  with thousands of useful links and cross references. Both the full and
the upgrade versions of the product contain:

 * Multi-platform  CD-ROM  plus  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  floppy  disk  (to  run  the data sharing
   software on @{B}Amiga@{UB} computers without CD-ROM drive).
 * Exclusive  interview  with @{I}Jay Miner, @{UI}"Father of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}" on topics ranging
   from  the  birth of the @{B}Amiga@{UB} to computers and society, in text format and on
   three audio tracks.
 * @{B}Amiga  Explorer 2.0@{UB} networking software, which allows you to connect an @{B}Amiga@{UB}
   to  one  or  more  @{B}PCs@{UB}, and access @{B}Amiga@{UB} files (including virtual ADF and ROM
   files),  directories  and  volumes  directly  from the @{B}Windows Desktop@{UB}. @{B}Amiga
   Explorer@{UB}  is easier to install and configure than other networking tools, and
   includes  direct  support  for  serial  (null  modem)  cable  connections, in
   addition to TCP/IP.
 * @{B}MSH@{UB}  filing  system  to  allow  all  @{B}Amiga@{UB} computers to read and write @{B}MS-DOS@{UB}
   floppy disks.
 * Officially  licensed  @{B}Amiga ROM@{UB} and @{B}OS@{UB} files from version 1.0 to version 3.0,
   to be used for @{B}Amiga@{UB} emulation.
 * @{B}UAE  Amiga@{UB}  emulator  for  @{B}Windows@{UB} and @{B}DOS@{UB}, and @{B}Fellow@{UB} for @{B}DOS@{UB}. All emulation
   support  files (@{B}Amiga ROM@{UB} and @{B}OS@{UB}, @{B}Cloanto Amiga@{UB} software, @{B}Picasso 96@{UB} drivers,
   etc.)  can easily be used by other implementations (@{B}Linux@{UB}, @{B}Be@{UB}, @{B}Next@{UB}, etc.) of
   these  emulators, as well as by future new versions. Experimental versions of
   @{B}UAE@{UB} for @{B}PowerPC Amiga@{UB} and @{B}PowerMac@{UB} systems are included.
 * @{B}Picasso  96@{UB}  drivers for the @{B}UAE@{UB} emulation software, supporting palette modes
   up to 256 colors, as well as true color.
 * @{B}Cloanto  Personal Paint 7.1@{UB} (paint, animation and image processing software),
   @{B}DirDiff  5.1@{UB} (file synchronization and replication software) and @{B}AmiToRTF 4.2@{UB}
   (to convert texts from @{B}Amiga@{UB} to @{B}Windows@{UB} formats), usable on a "real" @{B}Amiga@{UB} as
   well as in the emulation environment.
 * @{B}Amiga   Interactive  Guide@{UB},  by  @{I}Gareth  Knight: @{UI} an  encyclopedia  of  @{B}Amiga@{UB}
   technology, history and opinions.
 * All  upgrades  and  extensions  for @{B}Windows@{UB} and @{B}DOS@{UB} required by the emulation
   software:  @{B}Service  Pack  3@{UB}  for @{B}Windows NT 4.0@{UB}, @{B}DirectX@{UB} for @{B}Windows 95@{UB}, @{B}VESA@{UB}
   shareware software for @{B}DOS@{UB} and @{B}Windows@{UB}.
 * Tutorials  and  FAQs  on data sharing, emulation, floppy disks, serial links,
   TCP/IP, @{B}UAE@{UB}, @{B}Fellow@{UB} and much more.

--------------------------------------------------------

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/04/14@{FG Text}

@{B}AmiCON@{UB} -  The  @{B}Amiga  Central  Ohio Network@{UB}  is proud to announce The 3rd Annual
@{B}Midwest  Amiga  Exposition@{UB}!  We  are  excited to bring this dynamic event to the
Amiga community, and we want you to be a part of it!

Where:
Hyatt Regency
350 North High Street
Columbus, OH. 43215
(614) 463-1234

When:
October 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.

With the continued success of the @{B}Midwest Amiga Exposition@{UB} we are able to expand
and grow to serve the Amiga community better than ever before! The @{B}Midwest Amiga
Exposition@{UB} was created for users by users in order to bring the community closer
together.  See  and  test  drive  the  newest,  most exciting @{B}Amiga@{UB} products and
systems  available!  Attend  informational  classes  and  seminars, and meet the
people  who  support  and develop for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. Everything @{B}Amiga@{UB} under one roof
for three days straight!

This  year  we  have  expanded the floor space to almost 7,000 square feet. More
than  double  the  size of last years show! Exhibitors can now rent space by the
square  foot  with  several  size  booths available: 6x5, 8x5, 13x11, 16x11, and
20x20.  Six  foot display tables with tablecloth and skirting are furnished with
rental  space  for no extra charge. For those exhibitors who want a professional
look, pipe and drape is also available for rental on a per foot basis.

Along  with  many  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  notables  and guest speakers, we will also have hourly
prize  raffles,  games,  contests,  and  a  GRAND PRIZE drawing to highlight the
event!

Seminars  and  classes  are becoming an integral part of any serious @{B}Amiga@{UB} show.
Vendors  and  developers  are  anxious to present new and updated products to an
eager  community. We are committed to bringing top quality seminars to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community in order for you, the end user, to get the most out of your @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

To  better  serve show attendees, single day and two-day tickets for the @{B}Midwest
Amiga  Exposition@{UB} will be available this year. And, don't worry about rushing to
buy  tickets  ahead  of  time,  all tickets will be available at the door to the
show, thus eliminating any possible problems with "tickets lost in the mail".

On  Friday,  October 2nd developers from all over the world can meet to find out
the  latest  in @{B}Amiga@{UB} affairs. Classes and seminars will also be offered on that
day as well.

Saturday,  October  3rd,  and  Sunday,  October 4th, the show floor will be open
along  with seminars and classes. Hourly prize raffles, games (with prizes!) and
just about every company that sells something for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} will be there.

yesterday,  today and tomorrow! Shows like ours help potential and current users
find  out what is available, how they can get it, and where the @{B}Amiga@{UB} is headed.
Join  us,  this  year, at the @{B}1998 Midwest Amiga Exposition@{UB}, as we celebrate the
machine and the people that make it all possible!

@{I}Press Release @{UI}

April 21, 1998

First,  we'd like to thank you for showing an interest in @{B}Amiga Energy@{UB}. Work has
been progressing quite well on the magazine, and we expect to have issue one out
in  the  next  7-10 days. We were originally planning to have released the first
issue  by  now,  but  we  are  waiting  on  clearance of one of our more special
features  -  an  exclusive  interview  with  @{I}Petro  Tyschtschenko @{UI} -  from @{B}Amiga
International@{UB}.

Another bonus thanks to our links with @{B}Amiga International@{UB} is that every copy of
issue  one will ship with a complimentary "powered by @{B}Amiga@{UB}" sticker courtesy of
@{B}Amiga  International@{UB}.  We  know  that these are highly sought after, and we must
express our thanks to @{I}Petro @{UI} for supplying these.

Our  web  site  has  been under heavy development for the last few weeks and not
only does it have plenty of information on @{B}Amiga Energy@{UB} (and we hope that all of
your  questions will be answered there), but there are also a number of original
articles  and  features  that  won't  be  appearing  in the paper edition of the
magazine. In addition, the site has plenty of material covering all the areas we
are  currently working in including SF/Fantasy and our @{B}Star Trek@{UB} fan club, @{B}Alpha
Quadrant@{UB}, which currently has almost 400 members in the UK.

Anyway, we hope to hear from some of you soon, and if you have any more queries,
please don't hesitate to get in touch.

@{FG Shine}SYZYGY'S DIGITAL UNIVERSE V1.03 AVAILABLE ON CD-ROM FOR HALF PRICE@{FG Text}
------------------------------------------------------------------

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/04/24@{FG Text}

@{I}OFFICIAL RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENT 980419 @{UI}

- @{I}What is The @{B}Digital Universe @{UB}? @{UI}

The  @{B}Digital Universe@{UB} is an award-winning astronomical simulator package for the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  computer.  Since release, it has become the standard software package for
the amateur and professional astronomer. With our new lower price, we expect the
software  to  become  more accessible to the casual astronomy enthusiast, and to
those interested in generally learning more about astronomy.

For  more  information on the capabilities of @{B}The Digital Universe@{UB}, please refer
to @{B}http://www.syz.com/DU/amigacd.html@{UB} on the web.

- @{I}The New CD-ROM Distribution @{UI}

The  original  distribution of @{B}The Digital Universe@{UB} consisted of 14 floppy disks
and  a  printed  user  manual, all enclosed within a binder. Since more and more
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  owners  now have CD-ROM drives, we have decided that a CD distribution of
@{B}The  Digital  Universe@{UB} is now more practical than it would have been a few years
ago.

In   addition,  the  entire  printed  user  manual  is  available  online  as  a
context-sensitive  help  system.  We had many comments from individuals who said
that  with  the online help and the general user-friendly nature of the package,
they have never needed to consult the printed manual.

With  these factors in mind, and to keep costs down, the new CD-ROM distribution
consists  of  single shrink wrapped CD-R, with no printed documentation, box, or
user  manual.  Online  documentation  is  provided to explain how to install the
software,  start  the program, and access the online help. For most people, this
is all that is required.

The  software  and  databases  included  on  the  CD are the complete functional
version  of  @{B}Digital  Universe V1.03@{UB} that was being shipped on floppy disk until
now. For this reason, existing owners of the original @{B}V1.03@{UB} distribution have no
reason to upgrade to the new CD distribution.

- @{I}Cost of the @{B}V1.03 @{UB}CD Version of @{B}Digital Universe @{UB}@{UI}

With  the  original  floppy-based  distribution  of  @{B}Digital  Universe@{UB}, we had a
complicated  price structure reflecting the widely varying costs of shipping the
package  around  the world. The new CD distribution is much smaller and lighter,
and  thus  shipping  charges  do not vary as much. Therefore, we are happy to be
able  to  offer  a  single price of $75 Canadian for the package, which includes
shipment via air mail to anywhere in the world.

The  lower  cost  of shipping means that international customers will be able to
obtain @{B}The Digital Universe@{UB} for even less than half of its original cost.

As a rough guideline, you can use the following table to estimate the equivalent
cost  in  your  own  currency.  The  amounts quoted below were obtained from the
interbank  rates  on  April  11,  1998 based on $75 Canadian, and will naturally
fluctuate:

United States:   52.62 USD
Germany:         95.84 DEM
UK:              31.44 GBP
France:         321.53 FRF
Switzerland:     79.62 CHF
Italy:        94860.00 ITL
Finland:        291.20 FIM
Sweden:         414.06 SEK
Australia:       79.82 AUD

Canadian  residents  must  add 7% GST. Keep in mind that your country may charge
duty or import taxes on software sent from Canada (some countries charge as high
as  25%),  which  would  be  payable  to  your country's customs office when the
package arrives.

- @{I}Bulk Orders @{UI}

If  a large group is interested in obtaining several copies of the software in a
single  order,  you  may be eligible for a "bulk order" rate of $65 Canadian per
copy (a discount of $10). The bulk rate will be given if either:

 * A group makes a single order of 5 copies or more, which are to be sent in one
   batch to a single address
 * A  group  makes  a  single order of 10 copies or more, whch are to be sent to
   individual addresses.

- @{I}What about a @{B}Version 2.0 @{UB} for the @{B}Amiga @{UB} ? @{UI}

Some  of  you  may  be  aware  of the decision-making process we have been going
through  as  to whether or not to develop a @{B}V2.0@{UB} of @{B}DU@{UB} for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. So far, we
have  had  a rather encouraging response from our online survey available on the
web at @{B}http://www.syz.com/DU/amiga2.html@{UB} - if you haven't already filled it out,
we  encourage  you to do so. At any rate, we are planning on using a combination
of  the  results  from  this survey and the sales of this CDROM @{B}V1.03@{UB} to help us
decide whether or not to develop a @{B}V2.0@{UB}.

If  @{B}V2.0@{UB}  is developed, it will sell for our "regular" @{B}Digital Universe@{UB} price of
$150 Canadian.

- @{I}What about @{B}PPC @{UB} support? @{UI}

A  beta  version  of  a patch to allow the @{B}SAS/C@{UB} compiler to create code for @{B}PPC@{UB}
machines is currently available. In the next little while, we will be looking at
porting  @{B}The  Digital  Universe@{UB} to @{B}PPC@{UB}. If you own a @{B}PPC@{UB} board, are a registered
owner  of  @{B}Digital  Universe@{UB},  and  may  be  interested  in beta testing @{B}Digital
Universe V1.03@{UB} for the @{B}PPC@{UB}, please let us know. If the @{B}PPC@{UB} version is relatively
easy  to  complete,  we hope to offer it as a free upgrade (via email) to anyone
who purchased @{B}V1.03@{UB}, either on floppy or CDROM.

- @{I}If you already own the previous floppy-based @{B}Digital Universe V1.03 @{UB}, how are 
  you affected by this release? @{UI}

Since the software and data files of the CDROM distribution are exactly the same
as  what you already own, you have no reason to obtain the @{B}V1.03@{UB} CDROM yourself.
But  since  sales  of  this  CDROM  will  have a large impact on our decision of
whether  or not to develop @{B}V2.0@{UB}, you may want to encourage other @{B}Amiga@{UB} owners to
think about purchasing the CD. See @{I}"Referral Program" @{UI} below for more details.

- @{I}If  you  were  planning  on  waiting  for  a @{B}V2.0 @{UB}release of @{B}DU @{UB}, how are you 
  affected? @{UI}

If  you  are in this situation, you are the perfect candidate to obtain @{B}V1.03@{UB} on
CDROM  now.  Since  purchasing @{B}V1.03@{UB} on CD now will entitle you, as a registered
owner, to obtain future upgrades for half of the regular price, you will be able
to  obtain  @{B}V2.0@{UB} when and if released, for $75 (half of the planned $150 price).
The  net  result is that you pay the same amount to obtain @{B}V1.03@{UB} now and upgrade
to  @{B}V2.0@{UB}  later  as  you  would  to  buy @{B}V2.0@{UB} directly. Plus, you have the added
benefits of being able to use @{B}Digital Universe@{UB} now, as well as helping us obtain
the resources required to develop @{B}V2.0@{UB}.

- @{I}What  if  the  regular  cost  of @{B}DU @{UB} ($150) has always seemed a bit expensive 
  for you? @{UI}

If we develop @{B}V2.0@{UB} for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}, we would expect to sell it for $150 - the same
as  what  the  original  floppy-based  @{B}V1.03@{UB}  sold for. If you are only casually
interested  in  astronomy, and the $150 price seems a bit expensive, we strongly
encourage you to consider the purchase of the CDROM Version 1.03 now for $75. We
may  discontinue the CD-based @{B}V1.03@{UB} if a CD-based @{B}V2.0@{UB} is developed, and if this
happens, you will no longer be able to obtain @{B}Digital Universe@{UB} for $75.

- @{I}Referral Program @{UI}

In  an  effort  to  reward those @{B}Digital Universe@{UB} owners who help to promote our
software,  we'd  like  to announce our referral program. If you are a registered
owner   of   @{B}Digital  Universe@{UB},  tell  someone  about  our  software,  and  they
consequently  purchase  @{B}V1.03@{UB}  of  @{B}DU@{UB}  on  CDROM  from  us, we'll give you a $10
discount  on your upgrade to @{B}V2.0@{UB} if and when it is released. You can accumulate
discounts  for  each  referral  made,  up  to  the point at which you get a free
upgrade.  Note  that this must be a "personal" referral (ie: just linking to our
web  page won't count), and that the person ordering the package must provide us
with your name when letting us know where they heard about @{B}The Digital Universe@{UB}.

- @{I}How can you try out @{B}Digital Universe @{UB} first, before purchasing it? @{UI}

A   demo  version  of  @{B}The  Digital  Universe@{UB}  is  available  on  @{B}Aminet@{UB},  named
@{B}Dig_Universe.lha@{UB}  and located in the @{B}biz/demo@{UB} directory. It lets you try out all
the features of @{B}Digital Universe@{UB}, with the following restrictions:

 * only a small subset of the hypertext encyclopedia is included
 * it doesn't let you simulate the night sky's appearance after June 1, 1998
 * it only shows objects for a region of the sky in the vicinity of Orion.

Nevertheless,  it  should  give  you a good indication of whether or not @{B}Digital
Universe@{UB} is for you.

- @{I}How can you get a copy of @{B}V1.03 @{UB} on CDROM? @{UI}

If  you  would like to purchase a copy of @{B}Digital Universe@{UB}, you can do so either
directly  from  us  or  from  one  of our distributors. If you want to contact a
distributor,  let  us know your location and we'll be able to tell you who might
be  able  to get a copy to you the quickest. Keep in mind that all prices quoted
in  this  messages  are  our "suggested retail prices" and that distributors may
sell for more or less.

We  are also always on the lookout for new distributors of @{B}The Digital Universe@{UB}.
If  you think you may be interested in distributing our software in your region,
give  us  a rough estimate of the volume you might expect to deal with and we'll
send  you  out  more  information about our requirements of distributors and the
benefits   you'll   receive.  Please  note  that  we  do  not  accept  exclusive
distributorship arrangements.

@{FG Shine}@{B}HAAGE & PARTNER@{UB} NEWS APRIL, 1998 - @{B}TORNADO 3D@{UB} V1.5 - THE STORM RAGES ON@{FG Text}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/04/24@{FG Text}

@{B}Version  1.5@{UB}  of  the 3D-rendering-program @{B}Tornado3D@{UB} is immediately available. A
number  of  improvements  and  extensions  have  been  made from @{B}version 1.0@{UB} and
special attention was paid to the wishes and suggestions of the program users.

The  latest version offers, among other things, the possibility to render single
objects  using  conventional  raytracing  and  freely  combine them with objects
rendered by other means.

Freeform-deformation-cages  offer  much easier and realistic object-morphing and
the  newly  added  field-rendering and broadcast encoding make @{B}Tornado3D@{UB} fit for
recording animations to video in the highest possible quality.

For   creating   objects   from   scratch   @{B}Tornado3D@{UB}  now  offers  the  popular
spline-skinning  method.  Additionally,  a number of spline-paths in pre-defined
shapes (such as squares, circles) are available in the object-menu.

Creating  animations  has now become even easier and more intuitive - almost any
kind of keyframe is created automatically. On top of that @{B}Tornado3D@{UB} now offers a
pose-manager  that  makes maintaining the object properties much easier and also
enables you to inter- and extrapolate new keyframes from existing ones.

The  @{B}Virge@{UB}-chip  on  the @{B}CyberVision64/3D@{UB} graphics-card is now fully supported -
this  results  in  a much faster computation of the preview images, the speed of
which is unsurpassed even by a @{B}68060@{UB} CPU.

Regarding  object  materials  there  are  news  as  well:  @{B}Tornado3D@{UB}  now offers
displacement maps and textures. Displacement maps, unlike bumpmaps, cause a real
modification to an object's geometry which makes possible numerous and realistic
effects  that  could  not  be  achieved  through  bumpmapping, which is a purely
optical effect.

The camera-model used by @{B}Tornado3D@{UB} now offers an almost complete simulation of a
real  reflex  camera,  the  technical parameters of which can be adjusted within
very  large  limits.  Hand  in  hand  with  that goes an improved depth-of-field
simulation and better control over the motion blur effect.

For beginners @{B}Tornado3D@{UB} now offers useful hints and tips that are displayed upon
program start and whenever the user desires.

Project  saving  has been made safer and more convenient - all objects used in a
project  are  stored  in a dedicated project-directory - thus it is not possible
anymore  to  accidentally  store  a  project  and  forget to save the objects it
contains. Furthermore, @{B}Tornado3D@{UB} now offers 'quick-access' menus for objects and
projects which contain the six most recently loaded projects/objects.

On  top  of  that  a  large number of details were improved which can not all be
listed here.

@{B}Version 1.5@{UB} is shipped to all registered users directly by @{B}Eyelight@{UB}.

@{B}ICOA@{UB}  in  co-operation with @{B}AmigaSoc UK@{UB} and @{B}Amiga, Inc.@{UB} will be holding a set of
technical and non technical seminars. These are designed to encourage the spread
of knowledge and information throughout the @{B}Amiga@{UB} developer community.

We  ask any developer or technically gifted user who wishes to provide a seminar
to  contact  us  immediately.  Whilst  we understand that public speaking can be
intimidating,  and  many  people have precious little spare time as it is, we do
ask if people can make a special effort. The very thing that makes the community
so  special is that we all give to it. We will personally buy every tutor a pint
of decent beer to show our appreciation (lager drinkers need not apply).

@{B}ICOA@{UB}  members  can  get  into  the  seminars  free  of  charge  as  a benefit of
membership.  Other  developers and users will be charged a nominal fee to try to
cover any additional costs incurred.

All seminars require prebooking, either via E-Mail or on the day. Please sign up
early to avoid disappointment.

Many thanks,

@{FG Shine}@{I}USER REPRESENTATIVE @{UI}ELECTION 98 - THE ELECTION PROCEDURES@{FG Text}
---------------------------------------------------------

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/04/30@{FG Text}

IN COOPERATION WITH THE @{B}JMS@{UB}, @{B}TEAM AMIGA WORLDWIDE@{UB}, and @{B}ICOA@{UB}

The  bylaws  of  the  @{B}Industry  Council  of Open Amiga@{UB} require that the @{B}Steering
Committee@{UB}  have  1  full  voting  seat  to  be occupied by a user representative
selected in the manner deemed by the @{B}ICOA@{UB} to be the most productive way in which
to provide a user representative.

Therefore,  the  @{B}Transitional  Steering  Committee@{UB}  (@{B}TSC@{UB})  of  the  @{B}ICOA@{UB} invited
proposals  from  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  community  at large on selection procedures for the
selection  of a @{I}User Representative. @{UI}The @{B}JMS@{UB} answered this invitation with a set
of  proposals  and procedures that were hampered by time restrictions not of its
making.

When  voting was verified, there were several votes disqualified due to being of
a   fraudulent   nature,   leaving   three  of  the  candidates  all  but  tied.
Consultations  between  the nominees, the @{B}JMS@{UB}, and @{B}Team AMIGA@{UB} made it clear that
corrective action needed to be taken.

Because of the time constraints, lack of proper publicity, and fraudulent votes,
The @{B}JMS@{UB} in conjunction with @{B}Team AMIGA@{UB} asked for and obtained permission to hold
a  new  vote  with ample time for publicity, nominations, and voting from a much
wider audience than previously attained.

Following  are  the  new procedures outlined to gain a wider voting audience. We
urge  each  of you to take advantage of this opportunity to nominate and elect a
@{I}User Representative @{UI}of your choice.

The  person  elected  will  serve  as your spokesperson in the building of a new
@{B}Amiga@{UB} future. Choose wisely, but choose ...

@{I}EMAIL NOMINATIONS @{UI}

All  nominations must be sent to @{B}JMS@{UB} member @{I}Andrew Bienhaus(accolon@ionline.net) @{UI}
by midnight before (GMT) 30th May, 1998.  Nominations MUST include the following
information:

 * The  full  name,  preferred  language,  phone number and email address of the
   nominee.
 * The  full names, preferred languages, phone numbers and email addresses of at
   least five supporters
 * A  statement  that  the  named  people accept the election procedures and the
   decisions of the arbitrators as outlined below.
 * An election statement of no more than 500 words of plain text or HTML for the
   @{B}JMS@{UB}  election  web  site  to publish on the nominee's behalf. A URL with more
   information would be most beneficial to the candidate.

The  @{B}JMS@{UB} reserves the right to reject any statement whose contents do not appear
to  be  legal for it to publish. Separate versions of the statement in different
languages may be provided and will be posted by the @{B}JMS@{UB} as stated above.

@{I}Andrew Bienhaus @{UI}will write or phone to the nominee and each of his supporters to
confirm that the persons named are in agreement with the nomination, using their
preferred  language  when  possible.  If  @{I}Andrew @{UI}does NOT receive an affirmative
response  from  each of the above named persons no later than midnight before 31
May, 1998, the nomination will be considered invalid.

@{I}POSTAL NOMINATIONS @{UI}

Postal  nominations  must  include  all  of the information as required by email
nominations, plus the following:

 * Signature  of the  candidate with either an email address or a postal address
   AND phone number

   supporter

Postal nominations should be mailed to:
@{I}Andrew Bienhaus @{UI}

The vote takers, arbiters, and the collector of nominations may not be nominated
and  are  not  allowed  to  support any nomination. @{B}ICOA@{UB} members and prospective
members  may not be nominated and no more than two supporters of any nominee may
be @{B}ICOA@{UB} members or prospective members.

The  list  of  valid  nominees  for  the  election, along with pointers to their
election statements, will be made available by the @{B}JMS@{UB} as soon as possible after
2 June, 1998.

@{I}VOTING PROCEDURE @{UI}

Votes  may  be  cast by regular mail, Fido Netmail, email, or via a web form and
must  be received between midnight before (GMT) 2 June, 1998 and midnight before
(GMT)  20  June  1998. All voters must give their name and a valid email address
and  may  not  cast more than one vote in the election process. If more than one
vote comes from the same voter, all votes from that voter, email address and any
subsequent  addresses  will  be  disqualified.  Vote  takers,  arbiters, and the
collector of nominations are not allowed to cast votes.

@{I}VOTING BY REGULAR MAIL @{UI}

Ballots  may  be  obtained  through several @{B}Amiga@{UB} magazines for voting by normal
postal  mail.  Postal ballots should be mailed to @{I}Andrew Bienhaus @{UI}at the address
listed above.

@{I}VOTING BY FIDONET @{UI}

Persons  wishing  to  vote  from  Fidonet  @{B}Amiga@{UB} will forward a Netmail to @{I}Asha 
Develder, @{UI} moderator  at 1:202/720.5 and request a prenumbered ballot. @{I}Asha @{UI}will
return  by regular Fido netmail, a prenumbered ballot to the requester. Once the
ballot  has  been  completed,  this ballot will be returned to @{I}Asha Develder @{UI}for
verification.  Voted  Netmail  Addresses  will be posted to a listing on Fidonet
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  on a weekly basis by the moderator. Ballots will be forwarded to @{I}Andrew 
Bienhaus @{UI}no later than 20 June 1998.

@{I}VOTING BY INTERNET EMAIL @{UI}

An  official  ballot form will be made available once the list of candidates has
been  finalized.  All  votes by Internet Email must be made using this form with
only  one candidate selected. They must be forwarded to the official vote takers
email  address which will be announced at the time the ballot is made available.
Once the ballot is received by the vote taker, the vote taker will write back to
the  return address to confirm the vote. If the confirmation message is rejected
due to an invalid email address, the vote will not be counted.

@{I}VOTING BY WEB FORM @{UI}

Two  voting  forms  will  be  made  available on this web site during the voting
period. Voters must submit their email address on the first form in order to get

from the second form.

@{I}ANNOUNCEMENT OF RESULTS @{UI}

of  the election as soon as possible after the close of voting. This is expected

@{B}Amiga  Society@{UB}  in London or @{I}Gary Peake (gpeake@wt.net) @{UI}of @{B}Team AMIGA@{UB}. They will
decide  if  the  complaint  is  justified  and, if so, what must be done to make
things  right. The @{B}JMS@{UB}, @{B}Team AMIGA@{UB}, and the @{B}ICOA@{UB} disclaim all responsibility for
disruption  in  the election procedures due to failures in the network or in the
equipment used by their service providers.

@{B}CAVEMAN SPECIES@{UB}

A  small  planet  in  our universe bares witness to the emergence of intelligent
life!  In this evolutionary rage of power, the weaker will not stand against the
breed who shall inherit the land of the caveman species...

@{B}Caveman  Species@{UB} is a real-time strategy war game set in a world comprising of 3
continents that enclose over 90 playable locations.

Each  location  features  its own unique storyline that creates an ever evolving
and intriguing plot.

The   players' goals will be different for each location and can include, wiping
out  the  enemy  tribes,  reaching  a certain level of tribe progress or perhaps
discovering ancient cities or finding lost tribes.

Special  features  allow  tribes  to  interact  with elements like, witches with
magical  powers  `who can weaken the enemy in battle or turn them into frogs` or
visit Stonehenge to invoke the gods `who can fill your enemy with the plague` or
kidnap dinossaur eggs for breeding or ultimately hunt the infamouse T-Rex, train
it,  then ride on it`s back into battle to tear your enemy apart with one single
bite!

Since May 15th to 17th, will take place in London the @{B}'World Of Amiga'@{UB}. Although
unfortunately we're impossible to go, we have our contacts and in the next issue
of  @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB} you will be offered with detailed information about whatever
happens there.

Anyway  the future has a meeting on May 16th, Saturday, about 10 a.m. @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB}
agents  will  show  us  their  plans for the future: a new Operative System, new
hardware,  etc.  Exciting,  isn't  it? In the next issue you'll find an official
transcription (difussed by @{B}ICOA@{UB}, so it is official) about what was told there.
