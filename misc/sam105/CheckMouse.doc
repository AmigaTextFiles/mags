CheckMouse by Mattias Axelsson (Doom) 1995
------------------------------------------
This is a VERY simple routine to check the condition of the left or right
mousebuttons, useful in scripts for example. By checking the returncodes
you can decide what to do if the user is pressing one of them as the
program is being executed. The returncodes are:

5  (WARN)  = left mousebutton
10 (ERROR) = right mousebutton

Lets say you want to start a special menu if the user is pressing the left
mousebutton when your Amiga is booting, add these lines at the beginning of
your startup-sequence:

CheckMouse
IF WARN
  MyMenuProgram
ELSE
  <the rest of your startup-sequence>
ENDIF

- - -

If you just want to type something funny (and then continue booting):

CheckMouse
IF WARN
  ECHO "PC - go to hell!"
ENDIF
<the rest of your startup-sequence>

- - -

You can also check the right mousebutton, in order to make this work you
got to set the error limit to a value higher than 10 by using FAILAT:

FAILAT 11

Should be fine, this tells the Amiga not to abort the execution if a program
returns a error value higher than 5. You may want to change it back to the
defaultvalue (usually 10) after using CheckMouse. To check the right mouse-
button, use the keyword ERROR instead of WARN. Lets say yo want to list
WORK: if the user is pressing the right mousebutton, do like this;

Failat 11
CheckMouse

IF ERROR
  List WORK:
  Failat 10
ELSE
  Failat 10
  <Do something else>
ENDIF

- - -

Thats it! Hope you like it, it's one of the most uncomplicated programs I've
ever written...
