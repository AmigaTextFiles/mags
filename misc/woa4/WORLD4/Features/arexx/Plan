[1mThe Plan
[0m
This application will display, in sequence, a series of images, narrating
each image with a caption and a date, in natural human speech.  The
application will store each "slideshow" as a configuration file, allowing
the user to create multiple sequences of different images and narrations.

Approach:
The application will make use of the Amiga's built-in speech synthesizer
to perform the narration.  It will also use the built-in Multiview
application to display the images.  The application will also use a
graphical interface to establish the image files and the narration
content.  Reference User Interface Diagram Sidebar for details.

Components:
The speech synthesizer, which is a combination of hardware and a software
library to communicate to the hardware, is an advanced existing system,
which can execute over 40 different phonemes found in the English language;
it also interprets common English words into these phonemes, and handles
complex sentence grammar and numeric symbols, which is important when
narrations include dates and descriptions.  It has been tested, and
operates as described.

The Multiview application is an interface to view files in general
purpose; it takes advantage of Amiga Datatypes and libraries to open
images.  It can recognize supported files without specification beyond
a filename and path, and does not pose any restrictions on filenames or
their location.  This component is a portion of the OS, and comes with
several built-in image file datatypes.  This component will be
considered operational and tested to work for those image file formats
only; any additional image file formats will be determined tested by
testing results relevant to the Amiga Datatypes and libraries that service
those formats.

The User Interface component will control addition of new slides, as well
as areas to add a description, title, and the date the slide was taken.
The interface will also allow control over the order of the slides, and
allow one to remove slides, along with their description.  The library must
be available in the library path for the Operating System in order for
the program to run properly.

The File component will permit storage of a single slideshow to the
predetermined filename "slideshow.prefs" located in the same directory as
the application itself.  The contents of this file will be loaded on
startup, if the file is available. The file component will work properly
so long as the file is written only by this program.  It is not a
requirement that the application work correctly if the specified file has
been edited, but the application must be able to work without the file
available at all.

Operation:
The application will contain four elements. The first element will
initialize the library and attempt to load the slideshow definition file,
then proceed to format the main interface.  The second element will
manage the user interface, and update the slideshow in memory, as the
user adds, removes, organizes, and annotates the slideshow.  Addition of
new slides will use a common file requester.  The third element of the
application will present the slideshow, using the display component and
the speech component to display the images in the slideshow, and speak the
annotations for each slide, in order.  This element will also clean up
the open image windows and return to the second element.  The fourth
element will save the slideshow definition file, close the graphical user
interface, and free library resources properly.
