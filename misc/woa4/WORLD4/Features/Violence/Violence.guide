Right, this is a series of email taken from our private Trogsoft
discussion forum about Grand Theft Auto, and violence in games
generally. A hell of a lot has been censored, partly for legal reasons
so we don't get sued.

One the subject of games, Grand Theft Auto,  sounds to me (from the review
I've read) to have a horrible theme, despite its technical merits.  The
thought that one is playing a truly horrible person, in such livid and human
detail doesn't appeal to me or the rest of the guys in our company as the
sort of game we want to work on.  Two of us have young children, and the
thought is that if we think it's a bad influence on our children, we won't
participate. If you decide to make a clone, perhaps you could remove
the criminal/evil/horrid aspect of the game, and yet preserve the gameplay
elements, we'd be all for it, make you plenty of cool cars, and whatever
else is needed in the game.

Hmm. I realise that a lots of people dont like violent and evil games as GTA.

As for removing the violence, the problem is, if all violence was
removed, it will still have great gameplay, but it would just be a racing
game - GTA without gangs, guns, drugs, robberys is a plain racing game.

As i said above, lots of people dont like violent games, but there are a
significant number of people who do. The thing is, i love violent games and
i do not belive that they can make people evil or violent (i`ve just watched
the Scream2 film where the plot is based around this idea :). I like playing
these types of games to relieve stress and just have fun - its a game with
no limits. You can do all the things you wanted to do, but it is illegal.

[Censored]...all guns except air guns and shotguns are outlawed.

Thats fine if they want to get rid of violence over there, but its big
business here.

Name just ONE modern popular game that DOES NOT involve violence of some
sort - i cant think of any.

I dont see why it should warp 7 year olds minds, i doubt they will
understand what is going on.

I have been playing violent games for a long time and my parents dont
disapprove (im only 16 - since sunday) it hasent warped my mind.
Any how, i like GTA so much - i just bought another copy! for the PC :)

[Cut out alternative plot as suggested by Joe]

OK, i must admit that that is a VERY good plot, and its almost the same,
but, people WANT violence.

Unfortuanitly i have a very poor imadgination, but everything i do think of
is usually sick and twisted or just pure evil :) I watch lots of horror
films, play lots of evil games and generally talk and think about stuff like
this - with a few people on this list :) But, i would never drive down my
local high street with a large vehical no matter how fun it seems.
