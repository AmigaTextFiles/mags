[1mReport on the World Of Amiga `99 Show
[0mBy Samuel Brookes

I decided that we would goto the WOA99 show on Sunday the 25th July. This
time, as I now know another Amiga user that lives just down the road from
me, I decided to get my dad to take me and Peter Measham (The Amigan who
lives just down the road from me) instead of my Amiga hating siblings who
came along last time. I decided long before going, that when we go, I will
wear my MicroSoft T-Shirt at the show and see what people said.

First of all, instead of it being at its usual place (the Novotel in
Hammersmith) it was at the Kensington town hall. This time, as I now know
another Amiga user that lives just down the road from me, I decided to get
my dad to take me and Peter Measham (The Amigan who lives just down the
road) instead of my Amiga hating siblings who came along last time. As
usual, it isn`t sign posted and Kensington wasn`t on our map so we had to
ask the locals if they could tell us where the town hall is - supprisingly,
the people who live in Kensington don`t know their way around! (They were
from Kensington and not tourists as we asked if they live there first). We
finally parked in a car park (which was a complete rip-off) and walked
down the High-Street and found a taxi driver who knew his way around and
gave us directions, we then found it.

When we went in, we were charged £7.50 per person! (We were all classed as
adults - over 14 years old is classed as an adult). We got there just
before 11am, so there weren`t many people there. When you walk into the
first room, one of the first things you see is a huge video-wall to your
right - when we got there there was a foriegn bloke showing people the new
OS3.5, but I couldn`t understand what he was talking about (no offense to
him, I could only just make out that he was speaking English - my hearing
is not too good either, so it`s not his fault). There was a full scale
model of one of the Next Generation Amigas along with a working drawing of
it on the wall next to it. In this room there were only 5 stands; The User
Group Network, HiSoft, the AAA stand, the Amiga Format stand and of course,
the Amiga (the company) stand - which took up half the room. At the Amiga
stand they sold loads of novolty Amiga merchendise, EG, Amiga posters,
Amiga pens (Me and Peter bought one each), Amiga tie pins, Amiga boxer
shorts, Amiga Socks (Which Peter bought a pair of - very nice socks too),
Amiga lighters, and my favourite, the Ami-Cola! Thats right - Amiga
Cola!!! It tastes ace too - me and Peter both bought a can, a bit pricy at
£1 a can, but I found it funny.

From this room you can go into the main room where most of the exhibits
and Annex were pefroming, or go down stairs to the gaming room. We went
to the main room first to see the exhibits. It had all the usual ehibiters;
Eyetech, Power Computing, Active Technologies, Snap computers (I think),
Gasteiner and loads more (these are just the first that came to my head
and not necesarily the best). The ones me and Peter were interested in
were the games ones, I was also interested in CD sellers and cheapo-
hardware stands. There were loadsa of all of these, we spent most of our
time looking at the old disk based games as they were only about £3 to £5
for most of them and some were a tenner, there were also loads of free
gifts (which me and Peter took advantage of) and 3 for the price of 2 ect.
Peter found 2 games he was looking for (ZeeWolf 1 & 2 - I was in a kind
mood and bought ZeeWolf 1 for him as a late birthday present as I still
owed him a prezzie) and I found 2 games I liked, namely Base Jumpers and
Super Methane Brothers, but I didn`t buy them. I spent the rest of my
money, £17 after buying ZeeWolf for Peter, on Amiga pens, Amiga Format
issue 127 (my damned subscription ran out last month - and I didn`t have
enough money to subscribe at the show! DOH!) and a nice new CD32 joypad
from Power Computing.

One of my fave things I saw was the playable Beta version of WipEout 2097
running on a PPC A1200! After we had wandered around the main hall a few
times (before we bought all the above stuff - I went back in time in this
story without telling you), we decided to check out the games area. This
was the most disapointing thing about the show, there were a load of Amigas
around the room running one game or another, but not multiplayers - apart
from SWOS and BlitzBombers. There were 2 Amigas playing T-Zer0 on them with
HUGE TV screens, I didn`t get a chance to play it but it looks like a great
game - and the bloke standing there noticed I had a MicroSoft T-Shirt on!
He said laughingly, "Wrong T-Shirt mate" which I thought was funny. We
spent a few mins watching a few guys playing BlitzBombers and then went
back into the main hall. This is where the bloke from Weird Science, the
2nd (and last) person to notice my MicroSoft T-Shirt noticed it, saying
"You`re brave aren`t you. It`s a joke right?" while smiling. I started
laughing, said yeah and then walked off a few seconds later. I then went
and got a free Amiga sticker with my Ami-Cola and used it to cover where
it said `MicroSoft` on the front of my T-Shirt. I did see a few people
pointing at the back of my T-shirt and laughing - 2 blokes at Weird Science
were in hysterics! The one who I spoke to before showed the other one my
T-shirt as I was walking the other way past them later on in the day - It
also says `MicroSoft` on the back of my T-shirt with its web address.

Annex then came onto the stage at about 11:40, 10 minutes late as they had
a few technical problems. We spent this time getting out the room they
were in and looking at the technical drawings of the Amiga NG. When it was
safe, when Annex had gone, we decided to re-enter the main hall and look
for stuff to buy and see if we could find anyone we know. We found a few
things, didn`t find anyone we knew, and then went around the whole place a
few more times. At about 1pm we decided to actually spend our hard earned
cash (well maybe not hard earned) on loads of Amiga goodies - the items
are listed 2 paragraphs up.

I went and bought Amiga Format 127 and decided to ask Ben Vost to sign it
(dunno why) which he did - when I asked him, he replied "Yeah sure. It`s a
shit signature though, thats why its not in the mag, it`s a signature." I
just said thats fine and gave him AF.

We walked around one more time to see if we could find anyone we knew -
which we didn`t, so we left.

So, that`s the story of what me and Peter did - now what I thought of it.

First of all, the games room was a big disapointment - I was expecting to
have something like an 8-player game of Quake or Doom with prizes for the
winner (its said in AF there will be prizes - but I`m not sure if there
were any), but they only had a 2 player on SWOS and Blitz Bombers. If you
went last year then you will know what it is like - it was almost the same,
apart from in a different location (about 1 to 2 miles away), had a few
less stands and the stands seemed to be smaller than last year. As usual,
it was a great place for cheap Amiga stuff - both software and hardware.
Places like Gastiener selling their usual array of Amiga stuff at low
prices - a bare IDE x36 CD ROM @ £25! A bare 4.3Gig 3.5" IDE HD @ £69!
Loads of old games (but not used) were available at the Alive MediaSoft
stand from as little as £3 each, which is Peter got his games from, and
you got a free book of your choice or a cool new joystick (joystick was
worth a tenner), so we bought the games separatly so pete could ahve the
joystick and I could ahve a book - I chose the old (but new copy) Graphics
Workshop by Amiga Format. Snap computers were selling there usual 2nd hand
and new hardware - 50 disks for £5 or if you buy 100 disks you get 50 free!
150 blank, new disks for a tenner! They had a few A500s (2nd hand) for a
tenner each - I almost bought one.

So, in conclusion; It was a great show and I am really glad that I went,
but not much different fro last years show and nothing much special
happened. If you didn`t go, you missed out on treating your miggy to loads
of stuff at a minimal price - very low prices in there. Be sure to go next
year, even if you went this year, I am!

Note from Neil: We all may be there next year (if there is a show).
Possibly with our own stand, and own games, etc. Hope so, anyway. If this
is the case, I hope to see you there. No guarantees, mind :)
