[1mCD32 Control Pad
[0mReviewed by Samuel Brookes

You may be thinking "Why the Hell is he doing a review on an old CD32
controller?". Well, it may be old, but I only just got mine a few days
back (at the WOA99 show) and I didn`t realise how good they were - I think
that they are so good I am going to write a short review on it.

As you can guess, these were originally designed to be used with Commodores
failed attempt at a games console - the CD32. I am not going to talk or
review the CD32 console as I don`t have one. But, over the past year or
so, companies like Power Computing and Epic Marketing have started selling
them separatly to be used on normal Amigas like the A1200 or as replacements
for the original CD32. Before, if you wanted to use a control pad on your
Amiga instead of a joystick, you could use a controller designed to be
used on Amigas and Atari`s - these didn`t look too good and they were not
the most comfortable thing to play games with, or you could use a Sega
Master System or MegaDrive (Genesis) controller like I did. The Best one
that I found, was the Sega MegaDrive controller, but I only found one
game that used the extra buttons on it - Desert Strike (you could use
button C to change weapons instead of pressing the SpaceBar) and it wasn`t
too comfortable.

I have been wanting to buy a CD32 controller for a long time as I have a
lot of CD32 games which I run through the CD32 emulator on my A1200 that
came with the CD-ROM. So when I had a spare tenner at the WOA99 show I
went straight over to the Power Computing stand and got one.

At first look, it looks /sort/ of like the Playstation controller - just
darker, the middle is at the bottom instead of the top like the PSX and
it has a few less buttons than the PSX one. But it does have the buttons
at the top like the PSX and it has a set of 4 buttons on the right hand
side of it - but so does the SNES one. I personly think that PSX controller
was styled on the CD32 controller - or maybe it was styled on the SNES
controller, who cares :). I find it more comfortable than the PSX, but
not a comfortable and doesn`t look as good as the N64 controller.

The only thing that I don`t like about it is the circular direction pad.
Also, it would be far more useful if more games supported it, but they are
well worth the £10 they cost.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Supplier/Distributor: Power Computing and others like Epic Marketing.

Verdict: Very comfortable and should be supported by more games. If you
are a serious gamer - buy one if you don`t allready have one.

Score: 90%
