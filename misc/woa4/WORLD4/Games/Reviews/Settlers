[1mThe Settlers review
[0m

As you may or may not know, the game The Settlers is quite an old game
(1993), but we (the WOA writers) were asked to write a short article on
an old game, so I thought that I would review that. I will refer to The
Settlers as TS.

When you first see TS, it just looks like an ordinary `build-em-up` set
in medievil times, but if you read the manual, you will find out that this
is a /very/ complex game. When reading through the very well set-out and
writen manual, you may think that this game will be hard to play due to
its vast complexity, but make sure you dont have anything else to do for
the next few weeks before you start playing on it.

When you start it up from disk 1 or from your hard drive (if you run the
`intro` file), you will be show a very good hand drawn cartoon. Out of
all the intros that I have seen on both PC and Amiga games (thats a Hell
of a lot of intros!), that is one of my favourites, only beaten by the
Carmageddon 2 intro. The intro basicly just shows a knight (I`m not
sure who he is meant to be though, it could be you, it could be the
enemy, it could be someone with no relevence at all) riding his horse
through the orchard, the fields, the town and then finally, into the
castle. As I have already said, the drawings in this intro are excellent
and the sound is also some of the best in-game music that I have ever
heard - I sometimes just load it up to listen to the music, yet I listen
to bands like Sepultura! As there are 3 disks to the game, you can be
forgiven for thinking that there is a lot of disk changing (if running
from floppy), but the only times you need to swap is during the intro,
which you can skip by booting from disk 3, then put in disk 2 and no
more disk changing - unless you want to save you game that is.

When you get the the main screen, you will see lots of options and 4 big
faces of people. There are several game types:

# Missions
# Tutorial
# 1 Player
# 2 Player
# Computer controlled demo

Missions: There are a huge 30 mission levels! On these levels, you start
in preset positions in the map, the enemies, their information, and you
information is also preset. Each of the levels has a password to access
it and after every mission it gives you a new password. On the last 2
missions, there is a new character to play against, you cannot select to
play against him normally.

Tutorial: There are 6 tutorial levels to choose from, they are all
explained in detail in the manual, telling you what the objective of the
tutorial is and how to complete it. These tutorials are very easy and are
good for learning a bit about the game and how it works, but if you have
played it before they are a waste of time. The 6 tutorials focus on:

# Rural property
# Construction materials
# Food
# The riches of the earth and their exploration
# Fabrication of tools and weapons
# Attack

All in that order.

1 Player: This is my favorite setting. On this mode you can choose how
much stock you and you opponents start with (set yours right up and theirs
about 2/3 ect), how much intelligence you opponents have and the rate of
population increase in you settlement. You can also choose who you want to
play against from a group of 10 people all with their own strengths and
weaknesses - you can play with upto 3 computer controlled opponents. You
can also select the map size, from size 1 (only just fit all 4 players on
screen with all sides touching another player) up to size 8, but you need
at least 2Mb Chip RAM and 4Mb Fast RAM for this option and you are limited
to a certain number of settlers on each map size - on size 1 the max number
of settlers you can have is 500 and the max number on map size 8 is 64000!
The maps are created randomly by a list of randomly chosen numbers, or you
can type in your own - the same way as the Worms levels are made.

2 Player: This is identicle to 1 player mode above, but you can only have
2 computer controlled opponents, the screen is split verticaly and you need
2 mouses (yes `mouses`. The plural of computer mouse is computer mouses -
bet you didn`t know that).

Computer controlled demo: In this, you can set uo everything as in the 1
and 2 player modes, but you are not playing. You can watch upto 4 computer
controlled opponents fighting against each other. I personly find this very
boring, but it can be useful to learn from.

There is also a Team Mode. This is a cross between 1 player and 2 player
mode. You set up all of the varibles in the same way as usual, and you can
have upto 3 computer controlled opponents. But, you both control the blue
settlement, meaning that there is a verticaly split screen and you need 2
mice.

The ingame graphics and sound are excellent! You will probably think the
same when you start playing it, if you don`t like all that texture-mapped
polygons crap. There is one thing about the graphics that I don`t like:
all the buildings, yours and all the enemies, are identicle. This can be
advantagous as you know what the enemy buildings are.

The basic idea of the game is to build a huge settlement, create a huge
army, collect loads of gold, and then go and destroy the opponents
settlements and armies. Sounds simple enough, and it is even easy to play,
but if you want, there are some advanced options for you to play around
with - if you read the manual you will find out how to work these and it
will become very simple due the the excellent way the manual is written.

When you start the game, you are faced with a bare isometric landscape
(unless you are doing the missions or a tutorial level) with just trees,
rocks, water, sand and mountains. You can search around the mountains and
click on the geographic report and it will tell you how much gold, iron
ore, coal and stone there is contained in the mountains, if there is
sufficient resources to be mined and you have enough space trees and stone
then you can place your castle there. Once this is placed you can build a
large number of buildings, but you can only build them in certain places
which are defined by the contours on the land and the land type.

All the buildings work in the usual way of relying on other buildings to
supply something to them, so they can use it to make something for another
building. EG, you need a coal mine and an iron ore mine for the iron
smelter to make iron, this iron and some coal is then passed to the
armourer who then makes the swords and shields needed to make a knight. You
can even tell it how much of each resource and materials goto what
buildings, EG, you can tell it to send more coal from the coalmine to the
gold smelter than to the iron smelter ect. You can even set how many
knights should go to the outer guard huts, watch towers or garissons and
how many ordinary people are turned to knights.

Instead of the people moving freely from one place to another, you must
connect all the buildings together via roads, which is one of my favourite
features about the game. Along these roads you can put flags, these are
like waypoints where people leave things for other people to carry.

You will obviously need more land to expand your settlement, a lot more
land. You get more land by building either a guard hut, a watch tower or a
garisson near you boundary. As with all of the other buildings, you need
someone to occupy the building, for these buildings you need knights to
occupy them. A guard hut can hold 3 soldiers and 2 bars of gold (I think)
and the watch tower can hold about twice as much as that, and the garisson
twice as much as the watch tower. You may be wondering why they can hold
gold, well, the more gold you settlement has, the better you knights fight
in battle - simple. You can also gain small amounts of the enemies teratory,
sometimes even burning down some of their buildings, when your boundaries
are touching the enemies, build a military building there and it will take
about half as much land as it usually would, very useful if the enemy has
an important building near their boundaries.

When you have enough knights and gold and you are close enough to the
enemy, you can go and attack them - you can only attack other military
buildings, like the enemies guard huts and watch towers. If you win, you
will gain the building and the property the enemy gained from that
building becomes yours, and burns down any enemy buildings which were on
the land.

There is a LOT more to this game than I have written here, but it would
be far too long and i can`t be bothered to write it. If it sounds
interesting, buy it or borrow it from a friend.

Supplier/Distributor: Blue Byte

Verdict: An excellent classic game which I still think is better than The
Settlers 2 and 3 on the PC!!!

Score: 96%
