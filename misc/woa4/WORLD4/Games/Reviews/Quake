[1mQuake
[0mBy Peter Measham

The plot line to this brilliant game is :-

   The government has made a 'Slipgate', which allows to move matter from
one place to another instantly. But it just so happens a nasty alien called
Quake, (from a different dimension) will be using these slipgates to send
his real army to earth to destroy it. You are put in charge of Operation
Counter strike to find, and stop him. But before you set off one of Quakes
death squads hits your base, leaving you the only survivor. You know that
the installation holds a slipgate. Since Quake's death squad came through,
it is still set to his dimension (lucky that :). So, you can use it to go
and meet quake and feed him a few rockets.

   Quake was the first fully 3D, first person shootem up. For any one has
not seen or heard of quake; the general idea of the game is to stay alive,
and get to the end of the level destroying anything that gets in your way.
To help you with these two objectives, there are 8 weapons at your disposal

  · The Axe, (the last choice against the monsters)
  · The Shotgun,
  · The Super shotgun, (the same as the shotgun just fires to rounds at
    once)
  · The Nail gun, (it fires well, nails. you need to aim more than the
    shotguns, but more powerful)
  · The Super nail gun, (fires two nails at the same time, eats ammo,
    but it's very good at putting large hole in monsters. My favourite)
  · The Grenades launcher, (fire grenades which can be bounced off walls
    into monsters or even yourself)
  · The Rocket launcher, (not a good hand to hand combat weapon :)
  · The Thunder bolt, (not a good weapon to fire when in water, but a good
    short range weapon)

   Also in the there 13 monsters trying to stop you reaching your two
goals; from the easy one grunt (a 'customised serial killer', but its more
of a 'customised serial dier') and his dog. To the seriously hard Shambler
(a  basely giant killing machine, oh and by the way it can throw out
electricity and explosion don't effect it that much, nice :( ). finally
with round 40 levels of play, (with 4 levels of difficulty) and some top
notch muiltplayer modes. Makes for the best shootem up on the Amiga.

What all this is not enough, for you ?

No !?!!??, well ...there are 100s of updates (mods). Want to play quake
as James Bond 007 ? Lara Coft ? an SAS solider ? there are mods for all
of them. Want 25 new weapons ? Levels ? again there are mods for all of
them.
