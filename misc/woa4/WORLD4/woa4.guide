@{b}Virus Attacks@{ub}

Ok, the Amiga seems to be getting on track again, and as such, there
are the people who think it's funny to create destructive viruses
to eat away at people's systems. And just recently there have been
several alarming virus attacks.

And indeed, new viruses! Rather than me give you a little talk about
wht a virus is, we've decided to take the lazy option. But it's
for your own good. I'm sure you all know what a virus is by now
don't you?

So, here are the new virus warnings, courtesy of the Virus Help
Team, Denmark.

 Hi All....

 A new virus trojan has been found.  It is said to be a new update of the
 wellknown program  @{b}'CygnusEd v4.17"@{ub}. But if you start CED it will change
 the  size of your 'c:mount' command and  @{b}add 800 bytes@{ub}, and make the new
 size 7388 bytes.

 Here is some info about the trojan/virus:

 We hope to have a killer ready for this very soon.

 Thanks to iknow@, for sending archives and infected files.

 Hi All....

 The installer of the new link-virus @{b}"STD-Crabs_1"@{ub}  have been found. It is
 a fake version of @{b}"Miami DELUXE 0.9c"@{ub}. If you run the file "MiamiDx.beta"
 from the archive, it will infect every executed file with the "STD-Craps"
 virus.  At this  time only the viruskiller 'VT v3.14' is abel to find and
 remove this  virus. VirusZ, VirusChecker  and xvs.library will be updated
 as soon as possible.
