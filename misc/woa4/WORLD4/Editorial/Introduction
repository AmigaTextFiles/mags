Welcome to World Of Amiga Issue 4. It's now, erm, 8 months since we
started up, and in that time, we've covered loads of things, and
aquired several new writers, and this issue, we have another one
to announce. Paul Disbrey has joined us this issue, and we hope
you'll make him feel welcome :) Ooh, and we've got another new writer
too! Drew Green has started off this issue with a HTML tutorial.
Enjoy.

Ok, we've adopted a new release system. Rather than releasing on
the 14th of every other month, we now release on the second Saturday
of every other month (nicely timed for this issue, don't you
think? :) That'll stop people suggesting we release on the 14th
February to coincide with valentines day.

The Amiga Inc Technology brief has been released, right. It shows
Amiga's plans to make the best computer ever, and partially
shows it's spec, OK? So, why are people so angry? The release of
their favourite computer is imminent, and people are choosing
now to leave the Amiga. Why!?

Does anyone know? I certainly can't make any sense of these so called
Amiga fans. Why stick with the computer, go with the crowd, hoping
for a re-release, and when one is finally announced, ditch it and
go Wintel, or whatever?

Where is the logic in that? What is the thinking of these people?
Why is it that when a massive announcement like the new Amiga is
made, all things start going wrong. People sending abusive emails
to Amiga about the technical brief.

And people sending abusive email to Amiga involuntarily. Yep,
a new virus has appeared, a very rare occurence for this platform,
so the author has to be an Amiga owner (infact, the author IS
an Amiga owner, and supposedly a fan).

Is this linked to the technology brief? Or are we as responsible
for spreading consipiracy theories as everyone else in the Amiga
world seems to be at the moment?

Yeah, OK, I think I've asked enough questions of you now. 9 to
be precise. But can you answer any of them? If you think you can,
or just want to offer your opinion on any of the things raised
in this, then send your thoughts to woa@trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk

Well, at long last, I've finished writing my articles for this
issue! So, once I've got this massive production out to the
public, I can start to concentrate on Trogladite Software's space
adventure strategy type game, Recovery:2190. Enjoy the issue,
and I'll see you again on October 9th.

Thanks for reading...
