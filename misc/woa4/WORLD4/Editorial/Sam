Hi there, I`m Samuel the Co-Editor of this groovey disk mag. If you have
been reading from issue 2 (that`s when I joined this mag) or even issue 1,
then you will have noticed that I only write about 2 articles per issue.
Well, that`s not because I`m lazy (well that`s not the /main/ reason) but
because I have been doing my GCSEs at school - but I have now finished
and have a long break, so from this issue onwards I will hopefully be
writing a lot more articles for WOA. Just check out how many i have in
this issue :)

See ya - and enjoy my articles.
