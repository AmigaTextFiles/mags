   Photogenics 4 CD-ROM Released
   -----------------------------
   Yep, the long awaited Photogenics 4 CD was released today.
   Lots of major updates to the program make it something you really
   shouldn't miss out on.

9th July
   Collas Announces Linux
   ----------------------
   In a sensational move by Amiga, they ditched QNX (for various
   reasons) and decided to go with Linux instead. Bear in mind that
   this is not the Linux OS, but the kernel. The OS will be AmigaSoft,
   but based around the Linux kernel. In-depth evaluation this issue!

   There are some pictures from the World Of Amiga show 1999 available
   on the Amiga website

   Amiga to support RC5
   --------------------
   Amiga are planning to support the efforts of the Amiga RC5 encryption
   cracking team, who are currently if 5th place, I believe.

   AmigaMCC.com
   ------------
   Looks like someone (probably Amiga) have registered AmigaMCC.com
   ready to publish webpages about their new MCC Computer when it
   finally arrives.

2nd August
   Amiga Forever 3 Released
   ------------------------
   Cloanto's award winning CD, Amiga Forever, which is the only CD
   legally allowed to include the AmigaOS's and ROM images, and the
   CD includes Amiga emulators for other platforms, so you can use
   your Amiga on any machine supported. Cool, eh? :)

   Worms Armageddon Joke Reality?
   ------------------------------
   It seems that a joke published by Team 17 on their website
   announcing that the Amiga will get Worms 2 Armageddon will actuall
   become reality thanks to Hyperion who have aquired the rights
   to port the game. The joke also mentioned a possibility for an
   Atari ST version. Wonder if this will become reality too...

3rd August
   Transmeta?
   ----------
   Rumours are madly circulating which seem to point at Transmeta
   being the choice of Amiga. Amiga still aren't allowed to say
   anything about their decision of processor, but they have been
   clever, and dropped various hints over the last month or so, even
   to the extent of displaying a Transmeta logo at the WOA99 show.

   Too Much Revealed?
   ------------------
   Jim Collas has communicated his views on exactly how much information
   Amiga are disclosing to the public. He says that executives at
   gateway are wondering what the hell he is doing revealing as much
   as he has done. He makes the point that no information on the iMac
   was released 5 months prior to release, but I think thats a very
   different situation, in that the Mac hasn't been without an owner
   for years.

   Amiga Working Wit Corel and Sun
   -------------------------------
   Amiga are working with Corec Corporation, who intend to port their
   highly successful range of graphics applications to the new Amiga
   OE (Operating Environment). They're also working with Sun Micro-
   systems, but that's to be expected since Java is going to be the
   MCC's native programming language.

5th August
   Amiga in Non-Amiga Press
   ------------------------
   Amiga is getting an incredibly large amount of coverage in non-
   Amiga press, the latest event being coverage in a Malaysian
   newspaper. Hopefully, they'll start some sort of advertising
   campaign in the publications which have covered them, about
   a month before release of the MCC.

   Amiga Acronyms
   --------------
   We've compiled a small article detailing the Amiga acronyms such
   as MCC, OE, and the rest of them, just to help eliminate any
   confusion which may be floating around.

   Processor Speculation
   ---------------------
   Just to complicate matters, it seems that various different processors
   could potentially be used for the new MCC, since AmigaObjects TM is
   very portable, and is not limited to just one processor.

9th August
   Amiga AAC Launched
   ------------------
   The Amiga Advisory Council was launched recently. It's members
   include Ben Vost of Amiga Format, Wayne Hunt of Amiga.org, and
   many other highly respected members of the Amiga community.
   Quick note, Ben Vost won the UK AAA Award at the WOA99 show.
