[1mphase 5 digital products announces the AMIRAGE K2,
[1mthe first model in a series of powerful next-generation computer systems
[0m
  phase 5 Digital Products has announced it's Amirage K2 computer
which they hope to have shipping by the year 2000. Wolf
Dietrich says "Based on our license agreement with QNX Software Systems
Ltd., we are now able to provide our customers with a powerful realtime OS
with all the necessary functionality - and much more - that can make a next-
generation multimedia computer fly.

  "The lack of a decent OS, which can support our hardware vision, has
been the major reason that earlier projects for stand-alone systems at
phase 5 had been put on hold. That problem is solved by integrating the
QNX Neutrino OS, so we now can push forward our demanding vision of a new
powerful computer generation."

Upon reading the press release for myself (which we can't fully
reproduce because of copyright) I was quite taken aback by the features
that phase 5 say they will implement, and the timescale they intend
to implement it in.

According the phase 5, not only with the QNX Neutrino OS be available
on the new computer phase 5 are producing, it will also be ported
to PowerUP so it will be usable on the "classic" Amiga.

"We are excited that we finally can create a product technology which we
could not realize in the past, due to the lack of OS support and a
competition with non-existing but announced projects, which we were faced
with" says Wolf Dietrich. "The new AMIRAGE K2 design extends the
proposed features of our older pre\box project, and contains many elements
of the earlier A\BOX concept, but without the neccessity to design
customized hardware right now. As the QNX Neutrino OS concept is also in
full accordance with our vision of a new OS - in the past and today - we
feel that we finally can make the dream of many Amiga users as well as
other computer users come true."

Aparrently, the Amirage will not be low cost, but it will be reasonably
priced, and planned features include the following:

 · One to four PowerPC G4 processors, user-upgradable with standard G4
 processor modules, each with independent CPU clock frequency, allowing to
 scale-fit the system to any particular requirement (users who e.g. start
 with one 400MHz CPU can later add e.g. a 700MHz CPU and nearly triple the
 system performance transparently; this is the case for all the four CPUs
 as well)

 · Full QNX Neutrino support for the symmetric multiprocessing
 functionality of the AMIRAGE ™ K2 allows applications to make full and
 dynamical use of the installed CPUs

 · Up to two GByte main memory by use of fast SDRAM (industry standard
 DIMMs); base configuration comes with 64 MB installed

 · High-performance local 3D graphics, by use of a latest-generation
 leading-edge 3D processor, with a minimum of 32 MB display and texture
 memory, resolutions of 1920x1080 in 32bit color depth or better, and
 hardware video acceleration to support full-screen, full-frame DVD
 playback

 · Integrated Ultra-DMA ATA Controller; base configuration comes with
 6GByte  hard drive and DVD-ROM drive

 · Optional ULTRA-2-WIDE SCSI Controller

 · High-Speed IEEE1394 Interface for external devices and networking

 · Dedicated port for optional, internal Solid State Drive (SSD, up to 128
 MB capacity)

 · ISBEE (Instant System Boot on External Event) activates the system on
 user-definable external events such as incoming signals (e.g. modem or
 ISDN) or calls, or other events; when used with a SSD, the system will be
 fully operational within seconds

 · Two independent 12MBit USB port

 · Three 64-bit PCI slots, 66MHz, for high-performance add-on boards

 · Three 32-bit PCI slots, 33 MHz, for low-cost add-on boards

 · Twisted-pair 10Base100 Ethernet port

 · IrDa interface and MIDI ports

 · Integrated powerful multimedia coprocessor with specialized DSP
 functionality, independent VLD (variable length decoder) and image
 coprocessor for CPU-independent video scaling and filtering, color
 conversion, overlay, alpha blending and bit mask blanking of digital video
 signals

 · Digital Video In Port for digital video input in CCIR601 / CCIR656 format
 (eight-bit parallel, 4:2:2 YUV time-multiplexed video data) from devices
 such as a digital video camera or digital video decoder

 · Digital Video Out Port outputs digital YUV data-stream to devices such as
 a digital video encoder chips, digital video recorder, or other CCIR601 /
 CCIR656-compatible device

 · Video output supports 129-level alpha blending, genlock mode,frame
 synchronization, chroma key and programmable YUV color clipping

 · Dedicated expansion options (video slots) allow to add analog frontends
 for the digital video ports, either in consumer, prosumer or professional
 versions

 · 16-bit stereo audio input, analog or digital

 · 16-bit analog stereo audio output

 · Eight-channel digital audio output, 16-bit or 32-bit stereo format

 · Dolby ProLogic ® and Dolby Digital (AC-3) ® multichannel audio decoder
 and output (digital)

 · SPDIF output supports two-channel linear PCM audio, one or more Dolby
 Digital six-channel datastreams, or one or more MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 audio
 streams with programmable sample rates

 · Synchronous serial interface (SSI) provides fully V.34-compliant modem
 capability, and optional ISDN services and interface

The software support seems just as impressive.

 · Software support: System Services by the QNX Neutrino OS, including an
 Amiga OS 3.x legacy support package; 3D support by OpenGL compatible
 libraries; emulation for industry-standard applications from other
 platforms planned

 Note: These specifications are subject to change with ongoing progress in
 the computer industry, and will be updated to meet the latest standards.

phase 5 say the Amirage will also be the first fully-featured Personal
Network&Media Server that will function as a heart of a new generation of
computing.

"AMIRAGE K2 is not designed to only impress with a potential
hardware overkill. We do hear a lot about new applications and even
revolutions in the computer industry these days. We at phase 5 digital
products also believe that computing will differ in the future, and new
services will be expected by the users

 "But still the necessary hardware functionality counts, to make such new
services available. If you e.g. want your multimedia and 3D data streams to
appear somewhere else than on your local monitor, than a typical 3D display
card that outputs a single high-frequency analog signal, which allows a
maximum of 1.5 meters shielded cable, is not very helpful. For such
applications, fully digital processing units - as provided with the AMIRAGE
processor and coprocessor units - and networking capabilities are needed to
process the data and distribute it to any device or appliance that can
communicate with the user. The hardware of the AMIRAGE ™ K2, as well as
the superior functionality of the QNX Neutrino OS, perfectly meet the
requirements of such demanding next-generation applications."

It sounds very promising, and more information can be found at the
