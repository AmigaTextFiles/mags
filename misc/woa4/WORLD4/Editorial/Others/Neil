Hi there, I hope to get all the members of WOA roped into doing this
part of the mag, explaining what interesting things they've been up
to in the two months between WOA issues. Now it is exactly 8 weeks
between WOA since rather than been released on the 14th of every
other month (which sometimes gives us more time, and sometimes less
time between each issue), you now get WOA every 2nd Saturday of
every other month.

So, what have I been doing this issue? Amongst other things, I
finally got connected to LocalTel. That's one of only a select few
phone companies in the UK to provide free calls to their own ISP.
That means that if you send me an email between 6PM and Midnight
british time, you're guaranteed a reply the the same day, if not
instantly (depending on whether I'm out of the house or not).

But it also means that you have more of an opportunity to chat to
me. Tell me what you want for the mag, tell me what you think,
just come for a general chat! Whatever. I can be found on #amirc
on Dalnet under the handle Troggy, and on irc.esper.net on the
channel #trogsoft under the same handle. I'm there practically
every night any time after 6PM british time. Please come and tell
me what you think of the mag.

I've also been on holiday for a week during the making of this
issue. Possibly the worst time to go away too. It was the week of
the World Of Amiga show, and I missed all the announcements made
at the show and I'm still trying to catch up with it all as this
is being written (August 7th).

And that's another thing, due to me going away, things got into a
bit of a mess, even in the more than capable hands of Joe Solinsky
who was in charge on my week away. The main reason for things not
going smoothly was me not giving anyone the job of writing latest
news stories. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond my control,
and beyond Joe's control too, many people missed the deadline for
articles.

That is why we are working up to the release date. I'm about to send
out the issue to Phil (the Production Editor) to get it converted
to HTML tomorrow, and no doubt, I'll be dumping more articles on
him over the week, and I have no doubt that what you're reading is
of the usual high quality (that is, if you're reading it on the
web :)

When I got back, I found that Joe has been talking to Phil about a
new design for the WOA Online issues, although I'm not sure if
they take effect this issue, or next. Either way, I suspect you're
in for a treat.

Also, this issue, I've been watching a lot of TV. And it would seem
that I infact watch more of the British Channel 4 (www.channel4.com)
than I do of the supposedly more popular BBC (www.bbc.co.uk) and
ITV (www.itv.co.uk). And one thing I discovered while watching the
popular American teen drama Dawsons Creek on Channel 4, is that
Katie Holmes (one of the actresses in the program) is possibly the
finest teenage actrees ever, anywhere!

Anyway, until next issue...
