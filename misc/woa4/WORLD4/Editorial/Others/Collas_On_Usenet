[snip - relevant rant from well intentioned person]

Warning! I deserve to right to rant once in a while also so here I go:

I know that we still have to improve communication but visibly
communicating with a large community is difficult. I expend a
significant amount of effort listening to and understanding the Amiga
community. I have spent 100s of hours in the last several months
listening to and corresponding with the Amiga community. Here are some
of the activities:

1) I met with over 100 Amigans in multiple groups in St. Louis to
listen to input.
2) I have met with multiple groups around the U.S. to get input. I have
held several press conferences to get input.
3) I flew to Germany and the U.K. in May specifically to meet with 60
to 70 prominent Amigans and listen to input. Multiple feedback session
of several hours.
4) I met with key Amiga developers in U.K. and Germany.
5) I read the most popular Amiga newsgroups daily.
6) We have started Amiga sponsored forums to get input.
7) I read over 100 emails a day from the Amiga community and reply to
many of them.
8) I talk to people in the Amiga community many times a week.
9) Bill McEwen and Darreck Lisle read 100s of email a day and compile
the common inputs and questions fo me and other executives.
10) We are establishing an Amiga Advisory Council consisting of
prominant Amigans that were nominated by the community.
11) etc ...

As you can see I have had 1000s of interactions with the Amiga
community. I wonder if anyone realizes how much effort this is on top
of running the company. I wonder if anyone realizes how much travel
this is away from my family. I do this because I care about what you
think. I listen to the community and think deeply about the input as I
set the plans. In order to better understand our plans, there are a few
things people should consider:

1) There are many differing opinions in the community about what to do.
Many times people are pulling in opposite directions.
2) There isn't a single consistent set of requirements from the
community.
3) I am trying to make up for several years of flawed decisions. This
has made the situation very difficult. Because of the delay we can't
just evolve a product line like most companies would. This also means I
inherited a community with little patience (understandable).
4) There are a significant number of variables to consider and its
impossible to communicate them all publicly.
5) There are many things that the community doesn't know relative to
new technology advancements.
6) We can't share all of our strategic plans publicly.
7) This is an extremely difficult industry to compete in. There are
many big players with deep pockets. Microsoft just passed the $500B
value mark. We can't just waltz in with a "me too" strategy.
8) We are basically building company from scratch, not just a product.
Do people realize how difficult this is to do quickly.
9) There are constraints on budget and resources. We are working as
effectively and diligently as we can.
10) There are people that will blast whatever we do. No matter what we
do. It's unfortunate for me but they are understandably fed up because
of the past.

I know it's frustrating but don't judge me on the last several years.
These were screwed up and I didn't have anything to do with it. Judge
me on the last 5 months. I am driving Amiga in a way that it hasn't
been driven in a long time. As an aggressive, independent, and
visionary company. I am balancing technology, business, marketing, and
industry dynamics to come up with a plan that gives us a great chance
at being a driving force in the computer industry again. We are in a
very difficult predicament and I am defining a very strong plan to get
us out. It is not easy to understand all of the variables that go into
this plan. It's even more difficult to communicate it publicly. This
plan requires complex compromises and prioritization and not everyone
will understand or agree. Also remember, the first product out is not
the end of our roadmap. The only thing I can assure you is that I do
care about the community and I listen. I will drive relentlessly and
aggressively to bring back Amiga as a driving force. There is 101
things I can do with my career but this is what I have passion for. I
need the Amiga community behind me on this or we will fail. We have one
last shot. We can't afford to be diverted or distracted. We MUST stand
united to succeed.

Thanks for listening.

Sincerely,
Jim

This is our goal and we can accomplish it with the proper integration
of emerging technologies and standards. Thanks again for helping people
expand their thinking beyond a CPU, a graphics chip, and a standard OS.

We will continue to use the boingball for sure. Hadn't thought of the
penguin. Very creative but we need to be carefull not to be percieved
as yet another Linux distribution. There is much more to the new Amiga
than Linux. Thanks for the suggestion.

Fleecy is correct. There is a new computer revolution on the horizon
and many companies are trying to address it. I believe Amiga can drive
it and emerge as an industry force. Large established corporations
aren't very effective at driving disruptive technologies. History has
shown that revolutionary change is driven by small innovative companies.

We have compiled the nominations and selected the final candidates.
They will be contacted early next week so that we can get their
acceptance. We are not planning to release the names until the people
have accepted. Many of us are traveling next week to the WoA and
AmiWest shows so this will delay the AAC announcement. We should be
able to release names the week after next. Thanks for the interest.

By the end of the year but it is a very aggressive schedule.

I expect a handful of Amiga native ports at launch and access to a
large number of Linux applications (although not optimized). Expect key
apps like word processor and spreadsheet at launch. This partner to be
announced at WoA. We should see dozens of Amiga native ports in Q1 and
Q2 going to hundreds. Porting and optimizing from standard Linux will
take minimum effort.

Given all the input I was given I believe that the Linux decision is in
the best interest of the Amiga community. The technical concerns will
be resolved and we will end up with a unique and impressive Amiga
product which also leverages the Linux momentum. We will go into more
detail at WoA. Some of the most vocal people were against Linux but my
email (over 100 per day) is currently running 70 to 80% pro-Linux.

We are modifying Linux and will achieve this.

Carl is fairly busy with Rebol and not really following Amiga
activities so I didn't consider calling him. We have met a few times in
the past. You're right that it would be wrth getting his input.

I spent about an hour on the phone with Dave Haynie today. Although
still cautious, Dave feels much more comfortable with our decision. I
think he believes it's the right choice if we implement the
improvements I discussed with him. You should read his most recent Team
Amiga post.

Joe Torre and I had a positive email exchange several days ago. I think
he is behind our decision.

I have never talked to RJ Mical. Would be interesting.

Your welcome. I don't take your criticism as negative. I want to hear
opposing inputs to help guide me. You just have to remember that I have
the complex job of balancing all of the input along with the practical
concerns to define a single plan that I feel will be successful.

Sincerely,
Jim

You can expect some leading games ported for our launch. This is one of
the advantages of the Linux OS foundation. We found that many gaming
companies can be encouraged to port games to Linux because of the
momentum. Additionally porting to our optimized Amiga platform will not
take much additional effort. Should create a snowball effect.
