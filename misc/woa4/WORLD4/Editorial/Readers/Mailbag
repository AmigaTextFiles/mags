Welcome to this issue's mailbag.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear WOA,
   Nice special issue. One problem though - it wasn't very related
to the Amiga's birthday.
                                                               Phillip

Damn. I was hoping you wouldn't notice. There were a lot of things
in there about the Amiga's birthday, but I agree, it wasn't particularly
extensive was it. Sorry about that, but you still liked it didn't you?
:)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear WOA,
I was reading the article about Shareware etc which was on the
Amiga Club International magazine in May/June 1999. Taken from
your WoA magazine.

I feel that alot of points made in the article are either wrong or
mis-guided. So I'm obviously here to put my 2 pence worth
across :)

I think on the whole Samuel Brookes has put his points accross
well and informed those who do not know what shareware is
but he may have mis-guided people.

The first thing I notice is he is saying that people don't have
time or effort to get other money for various countries but
he makes out that that is no excuse. Of course you can goto
the Post Office and change money if you want to pay £2.50
just to change the money and then however much money you
want depending on the country. Or as he says you can get
an International Money order if you want to pay £8 like
through the main-stream bank I am with.

I think before Samuel Brookes says about these 'great' ways
of sending money he should research into what he is talking
about because Post Office charge £2.50 and then you have to
send cash through the post that won't get their at the best
of times or you can pay £8 extra for an International Money
Order. I don't think either way is very good because one you
have to pay extra and chance and one your probably paying
more for the money order than you are for whatever you
are registering.

Trusting a bank is much a different matter. They are a 'real'
buisness and so if it is well known they are hardly likely
to run off with your money, I wonder where Samuel Brookes
does his banking.

If he has to pay off a big phone bill then he can't register
the software but if he goes out more next month he can
afford it next month :) simple!

He says that yes and no it is easy to become a shareware
author and *make lots of money*. Well if he implys that it is
easy to make lots of money then he has no idea of the
Amiga market situation. Amiga commercial games will sell
little more than 500 copies worldwide if they are lucky
and utilities will sell very few. I don't think shareware
authors make programs to make money they make program
as either there is no software available that does what
they want to do, or they want to improve on someone elses
program and so they make it. It is normally the people who
think they can get rich quick who make the worst software
and get the worst amount of replies.

The last bit I did not understand is he makes out that Amiga
shareware authors are the only 'normal' people creating
games/utilities for the Amiga. Who exactly does he think
makes the Commercial software. Do you see any big computer
industry names on the Amiga? I think not... these days
commercial Amiga software is made by dedicated teams of
'normal' people so basically everything these days is made
by 'normal' people on the Amiga market.

The 'moral' that Samuel Brookes makes is true on the PC
market but not at all true for the Amiga market. The Amiga
Shareware market has very little space between itself
and the Commercial market because authors who make
products for the Amiga either go from Shareware to
Commercial or it is all basically the same thing.

Overall I don't think that shareware authors are creating
software to make money because most are realistic and
know they aren't going to make a living. The only way
to support these authors is to register their software
if you like it and it requires that or just email them and
tell them. Most authors that don't ask for any registration
fee get very little feed back and this may cause them to
give up. So the real 'moral' is support your authors
with emails and letters if no registration is required
and this is how they will continue.

Neil Says...

Ah, I thought I recognised your name from somewhere :)

We probably should have done some research into the cost of
posting money abroad as neither me nor Sam knew the exact
figure. Thanks for pointing that out.

I agree completely with the last point. If no-one supports
shareware authors then a lot of them will go to the so-called
'greener pastures' of the PC where they feel they will make
more money. This, however, according to various official
sources as you could have seen in our previous issue's bumper
crop of Interviews.

Epic Marketing's games person quoted the figure of game sales
closer to 1000, and possibly more if the game had the correct
publicity before release. Games such as Napalm which were very
hyped, months before their release can expect higher sales figures
than those quoted by Epic.

However, you are just about guaranteed a certain number of sales
in the Amiga market, which is why it is one of the easiest to
actually make money in. As is demonstrated by your letter to me.
In the PC world you'd be hard pushed to find two creators of a
similar type of product contacting each other with friendly advice.

Dear WOA,
   Just a quicky to say I loved the ARexx articles last issue. Very
useful. Thanks.
                                                                 John

Don't thank me, thank Joe. He's the one who wrote it :) Anyway, I've
passed your comment on.
