Welcome to one of these chat type things. We do these every week on
Sunday at 10PM on irc.afternet.org on the #trogsoft channel. Feel
free to join in. We thought we'd include this one for your reading
pleasure, since the ones in Issue 2 got nice comments. Anyway, the
people who took part in this one...

Troggy:        Me, Neil. The Editor-type-person
Frank:         Frank Mathieson. He quit part of the way through though.
Meash:         Peter Measham. He's always here :)
Mouseomatic:   Drew Green, our newest recruit to WOA
Phil:          Phil Ellis, our production editor

Anyway, on with the show
------------------------------------------------------------------------

<Troggy> Well, only took 8 attempts to connect :)

<Frank> hi troggy

<Meash> only 8 ???

<Troggy> yep

<Troggy> Usually only takes me 3 or 4

<Troggy> I was being sarcastic then

<mouseomatic> we knew

<Troggy> :)

<Troggy> I can sometimes do it in the first attempt :)

<mouseomatic> so what's the amigaguide version like? (not wanting to change
              the subject, or anything)

<Troggy> Oh, please do change the subject :)

<Meash> :)

<mouseomatic> k

<Troggy> The AmigaGuide version consists of lots of links with a few notes
         after them. It's basically the same as before, just with a
         hypertext file linking all the external files together

<Phil> I told you to do it in HTMl

<Troggy> that's your job isn't it?

<mouseomatic> did you try Heddley?

<Troggy> If I did it, you'd be redundant Phil :)

<Phil> For general release I mean

<Troggy> Well, a few people in the survey don't want a downloadable HTML
         version. Someone's working on a custom GUI for me at the moment

<mouseomatic> me! me!

<Troggy> And mouseomatic here is doing a DMC version, which is a
         possibility

<Troggy> :)

<mouseomatic> me! me!

<Troggy> Oh., I didn't send that to you did I phil?

<mouseomatic> meeeee!

<Phil> what?

<Troggy> a huge DMS archive

<mouseomatic> well, I can't help that

<Troggy> of a possible new look for WOA

<Troggy> I know you can't help it

<Troggy> I'll send you it now if you like

<Phil> No, but with my new Hypercom3+ it would have downloaded in a
       flash :-))))

<Phil> NO!

<Troggy> :)

<Troggy> no, you don't want me to send

<mouseomatic> can't you send files over IRC?

<Phil> Do I need to see it?

<Troggy> no, but you might like to comment on it

<Phil> How big?

* mouseomatic sobs quietly in a corner

<Troggy> It's about 460K I think

<Phil> No problem

<Troggy> send?

<Phil> Yes

<Troggy> cheer up mouseomatic :)

<Troggy> Email or IRC?

<mouseomatic> <sniff>

<Phil> IRC

<Troggy> right, lets see if this awful new version of mIRC can send things
         properly then...

<mouseomatic> what? you're on a peecee?

<Phil> Hey I just downloaded that for a mates PC

<mouseomatic> I'm (unfortunately) using one of those s**t machines too

<mouseomatic> gosh. We all like amigas (i hope ;) but we're all using
              peecees. hmm

<Phil> Are Joe and I the only ones who actually use Amigas?

<Troggy> yeah. The reason I didn't reply then when you originally asked
         was because I had the DCC send window open, and as we know, a
         child window of a program must be closed before you can use the
         parent window :(

<Frank> I do

<Troggy> Yep, you Frank and Joe are the only ones

<Phil> :-(

<mouseomatic> I use it, but it hasn't got internet access.

<Troggy> Start up the bar dood, I'm hungry!

<Troggy> :)

* Phil has told Kryten to open the bar...Type #Menu to get the menu, and
  # followed by the snack you want, to  get it - |DWaRFMeNU|

<mouseomatic> but #menu won't work...

<Troggy> #menu

<mouseomatic> d'oh! ;-)

<Meash> #menu

<mouseomatic> #menu

<Phil> Be gentle! I'm still downloading the DMS

<Troggy> oh, yeah. Sorry

<mouseomatic> what is dwarfmenu when its all there?

* Phil hands Meash AN ICE COOL CAN OF COKE.

* Phil hands Troggy AN ICE COOL CAN OF COKE.

<Troggy> Ahhh.... much better :)

<mouseomatic> #BurgerKing A Whopper and fires.

<Phil> Phil hands Phil an ice cold can of Fosters :-)

<mouseomatic> (apparently)

<Meash> hehe

<Troggy> :)

<mouseomatic> #sprout_soup

* Phil hands mouseomatic A GRASSY GREEN BOWL OF HOT SPROUT SOUP.

<Troggy> :)

<mouseomatic> mmm

<Phil> The DwarfX scripts don't get very good press

<Meash> why ?

<mouseomatic> #Space_weavel

* Phil hands mouseomatic A PLATE OF SPICEY KING PRAWN [WELL SPACE WEAVEL
  ACTUALLY BUT HE WONT NOTICE].

<Troggy> Mr Murfin isn't getting very good comments on the afb at the
         moment is he?

<Phil> That's what I mean

<Troggy> yeah. Dunno why, he seems pretty cool from the conversations I've
         had with him

<Meash> oh well

<Phil> I know there are a lot of destructive scripts but it's the users not
       the programmer that cause problems

<mouseomatic> Here, troggy - you know that uninstaller program... how?

<Troggy> yes

<Troggy> how what?

<mouseomatic> well.... how?

<mouseomatic> how.... does it work, perhaps.

<Troggy> by deleting stuff :) or do you want it more specific than that?

<Phil> Oh yes, where can I find ASCI art, and is it any good?

<mouseomatic> yes pls

<Troggy> Phil: I don't have a clue

<mouseomatic> phil: there was a webpage with a program that lets you draw
              in ASCII

<Troggy> mouseomatic: It usues a script that people have to create when
         their program is installed.

<Frank> cya folks

<Phil> I thought it was a trogsoft product.

<Troggy> byeee :)

<Phil> CY Frank

<mouseomatic> buh bye

*** Frank has quit IRC

<Troggy> What, ASCII Art Studio?

<mouseomatic> possibly...

<Phil> I can't remeber the name

<Troggy> That's a Mantasoft program. http://mantasoft.aio.co.uk

<mouseomatic> its on a site along with James Bond

<Phil> I fancy setting up a BBS

<mouseomatic> yes... mantasoft.

<Phil> Hey, who did that to my browser

<Troggy> What?

<mouseomatic> ???

<Phil> It went to Mantasoft all by itself

* mouseomatic scratches his ear, making a pleasant 'skritch skritch' sound

<Troggy> :)

<Phil> Only AMIGA makes it possible :-)

<Troggy> How did it do that then? Are you using AmIRC3? Maybe it has some
         nice new features that do that when someone mentions a URL :)

<mouseomatic> here, lets try another one....

<mouseomatic> http://www.miggy.tsx.org

<mouseomatic> heh heh

<mouseomatic> ;-)

<Phil> No Ive got ". something

<Troggy> This could be a severe disadvantage to you Phil if that's what
         it does :)

<Phil> mousemattic is resposible

<Troggy> http://web.ukonline.co.uk/trogsoft/laced_frames.htm

<mouseomatic> no i'm not. btw - http://www.ann.lu

<mouseomatic> hahaha

<Phil> Thanks troggy I was looking for ASCI art!

<Phil> Shit!

* Phil slaps mouseomatic in the face with Duane Dibbley

* Phil slaps Troggy on the head with a copy of 'What Carcus?' magazine

<mouseomatic> oww!

<Troggy> :)

<Meash> :)

<mouseomatic> hmm.

* Troggy slaps Phil around a bit with a large trout

<Troggy> Hey, can you tell if I do this Phil...

<Phil> Boring

* Phil slaps Troggy in the face with a chicken

* mouseomatic picks up a conveniently placed fire hydrant and throws it
  in phil's direction

<Phil> Better

<mouseomatic> hello X2!

<Phil> I didn't realise today was "pick on Amiga user" day

* Troggy slaps Phil in the face with the decaying carcas of a dead
  tyrannosaurus rex from 10 million years ago.  Upon impact it shatters
  into a million pieces covering Phil with prehistoric dust and suffocating
  him instantly

<Troggy> :)

<Phil> Getting flash now

<Troggy> yep

<mouseomatic> sheesh.. get a vacuum cleaner in here now!

<Troggy> :)

<Troggy> Incidentally, http://web.ukonline.co.uk/woa3/ and
         http://web.ukonline.co.uk/woaspecial/ are the new URL's of the
         HTML WOA versions

<mouseomatic> oh we are cruel

<Phil> Been there

<Troggy> Free-Online is sort of bust :)

<mouseomatic> I've got unlimited space at bt!

<Phil> And I have with Ukonline

<Troggy> do you get Unlimited space at UKonline?!

<mouseomatic> ahh, but mines better unlimited space

<Troggy> :)

<Phil> Mines BIGGER

<Troggy> hahah :)

<Troggy> Mine's Free-er

<mouseomatic> mines more spangly

<Troggy> Infact, Mine's Free :)

<Troggy> No phone bill either :)

<Phil> Mine is open 24 hrs

<Phil> Troggy wins!

<mouseomatic> pourquoi no phone bill?

<Troggy> Localtel and Screaming.net  - Left behind those extortionate BT
         prices now :)

<mouseomatic> 0800 at weekends...

<Troggy> and off peak

<Troggy> for me :)

<Troggy> 6PM-8AM

<Meash> but

<Phil> And they support the Amiga

<Phil> NOT!

<Troggy> you can sign up using an Amiga I think

<Troggy> just have to change phone companies

<mouseomatic> hmmm.

<Phil> Only if you can run IE5

<Troggy> Is it?

<Phil> Think so

<Meash> the url is ...

<Troggy> I don't see why

<Meash> signup.screaming.net

<Troggy> Get someone with a PC to register an account for you, and you
         just connect :)

<Phil> I've got a couple of PC owning pals who owe me a favour

<mouseomatic> what, like me, here, now.

<Troggy> I'll do it if you want, but you need to change phone company
         first :)

<mouseomatic> on a peecee

<mouseomatic> with ie5

<Phil> Anyone tried Pegasus for their mail?

<mouseomatic> (but I don't _like_ it)

<Troggy> nope

<Troggy> :)

<Phil> It's shit hot

<Phil> much better than OE

<Phil> and free

<Troggy> Oh, and you can use the UKOnline webspace without being connected
         to UKOnline, and I can still get my Freeserve email without being
         connected to Freeserve! The ideal solution!

<Troggy> Is that a PC mail proggy, Pegasus?

<mouseomatic> that's amaaaaaazing!

<Meash> HOW ?

<Phil> I can do that with Abelgratis too

<Phil> but I have to pay for calls ;-(

<Troggy> Yeah, It's just UKOnline not preventing people from doing it :)
         Silly people :)

<mouseomatic> I think you can do it with most isps

<mouseomatic> for a fee ;-) (think about it)

<Phil> You can pick up mail but not send

<Phil> Pegasus is for PC

<Troggy> Freeserve don't usually let you get email from other ISPs and
         they definately don't let you in to the webspace without being
         connected to them. I can send mail too, btw

<mouseomatic> hokay. Q. how many mice does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

<Troggy> erm... 9? :)

<Phil> ?

<mouseomatic> A. Two, but how did the get there in the first place?

<mouseomatic> hohoh

<Troggy> hehe :)

<Phil> How did what get where?

<mouseomatic> they.

<mouseomatic> sorry

<mouseomatic> get it? screw? as in fu*k?

<mouseomatic> hahahahaha

<Troggy> HAHahah :)

<Troggy> Just got that :)

<Phil> :-\

<Meash> oh :)

<mouseomatic> oh, well fine then.

<Meash> why the *

<Phil> He's a gentleman

<Troggy> Yeah, and if possible, I'd like this to go into WOA4 :)

<mouseomatic> yea. that's right. a gentleman.

<Phil> What in WOA4

<Troggy> this chat transcript

<Troggy> people seemed to like the ones in WOA2

<Troggy> So I thought I'd do some more

<Troggy> Of course, me doing them on my own would be very boring, so that's
         why you're all here :)

<Phil> Phil goes suddenly silent and slopes out the back door.

<Troggy> :) Don't worry. Just be yourself :)

<Meash> like the ones with fish ?

<Troggy> nooooooooooooo

<Meash> why ?

<Troggy> too... erm... insane

<Troggy> and very hard to follow when you're reading it as a tewxt file

<Meash> :))))

<Troggy> I think

<Troggy> Damn

<Troggy> I think I need to put this hard drive in my A600 soon. It's just
         sitting in my room not doing anything at the moment. It needs a
         hard disk.

<mouseomatic> you could send it to me

<Phil> You could bin it

<mouseomatic> i need an extra one.

<mouseomatic> my workbench partition is only 10megs, and due to lack of that
              wonderful foresight thing, it's now almost full.

<mouseomatic> hey, do you guys get paid for this?

<Phil> Mouse. move your FONTS

<Phil> I dunnoo!

<Troggy> Stop!

<Troggy> One subject at a time. This will confuse the readers :)

<mouseomatic> eh?

<Troggy> Not that I care, but I don't want any complaints, y'see :)

<Phil> mouse. Try moving your FONTS: dir to another partition

<mouseomatic> phil: how, pray tell?

<mouseomatic> won't that just screw up my really fragile setup?

<Phil> mouse. Change the assign in your S-up to point to where you've moved
       then to.

<mouseomatic> what? that's it?

<Phil> thats it

<mouseomatic> my god!

<mouseomatic> an easy task by half!

<Troggy> yep. I've done it for Libs, Devs, C, Fonts and L

<mouseomatic> ;-)

<Phil> I did it before I got a new HD

<Phil> and I'm thick!

<Troggy> My System partition is 20MB and filled with crap, so I moved all
         my system assigns

<mouseomatic> my HD's supposed to be 500megs, but they sent me a 420 one.

<mouseomatic> they being Siren Software

<Phil> My System is 100Meg

<Phil> Mines bigger than yours :-)

<Troggy> hehe

<Troggy> My Sys: is 20MB and my Work: is the other 580 :)

<mouseomatic> I need a gig or so.

<Phil> Well gents, as nice as it is to talk to you, I really have to go and
       watch the Arse beating my team again. Such is my devotion.

<Phil> TAlk to you soon.

<Troggy> And work contains 4 main directories, TDS, WOA, Games and Utils
         each of which has an MWB Disk icon, but is really a drawer and is
         left out on my Workbench so it looks like a drive, and it's
         assigned like a drive too :)

<Troggy> yeah, seeya Phil :)

<Meash> bye
