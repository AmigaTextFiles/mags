@toc MAIN

This month's meeting promises to be nothing if not interesting. We'll be
seeing what's available in the world of cross platform computing.
Scheduled to appear are an Emplant (to show what it looks like to run a
Macintosh emulator on an Amiga) and a bridgeboard (to show the wonderful
world of MS-DOS).

Also on this month's schedule is demo of networking on the Amiga. This
will be of particular interest to those of you that have multiple Amiga's
or need to link up with machines of other origins.

@{b}Notes from the Prez@{ub}

by Ron Cleaveland

About now your asking what happened to the newsletter?

There's been a change! A change we have been discussing and putting off
for some time now. A declining Amiga User Base resulting in lower group
membership has forced us to make some financial cutbacks a few months back
we moved from a meeting place that cost $75.00 to UNO which cost $0 or
$25.00 depending on if we use video equipment or not. This alone helped
but we still have one other major expenditure the newsletter which was
costing us about $155.00 a month to print and mail. Since your reading
this, you now know how we are cutting the newsletter cost with a disk
based Newsletter. The disk contains the newsletter in AmigaGuide format
all you have to do is put it in your Amiga and double click the icon. You
should then see the newsletters title page containing the content buttons
by clicking on them you will be able to read the same informative packed
newsletter that you have come to expect from the User Group. Another way
we can cut back is how we distribute the newsletter there will be three
choices and you are free to use anyone you like.

1. If you have a modem you can download it from Larry's Hot Tub
2. If you plan to attend the meeting you can get a copy of it there.
3. If you are unable to do either of the above then we will mail you the
   disk.

  We do ask that you let us know if you need the third option.

  Now that you know how we intend to cut cost how about something that
will help increase the groups finances. Thanks to a great idea from Clete
Baker I think we have an exciting new way to do just that many of you may
have heard of Aminet. Aminet is the world's largest archive of Amiga
shareware and Public Domain software which is updated daily. The only
problem is that you need access to the Internet in order to anonymous ftp
(file transfer protocol) to the Aminet site. We will now be able to access
this archive at the meeting allowing you to request the newest Amiga files
available. There will be an up to date printed and computer text file
copies of the Aminet archive available at the meetings. There will be a
nominal cost for this service which will depend on the quantity and file
sizes of your order.

  This month's program should be of interest to those of you looking to
expand your computing options with out buying a whole new computer. With
cross platform computing you can give new life to your Amiga with products
like the Emplant for Macintosh emulation and Bridgeboards for MS-DOS
emulation. We will have demonstrations showing you how well these products
work, with the added bonus of a tune-up clinic for those of you who
already own these products.

  One final piece of business we will be performing this month is the
nomination of officers for the coming year. The offices that will need to
be filled are President, Vice President, Treasure, Membership Chairman and
Librarian. As I've said many times before we are always looking for new
blood and new ideas, these are a very necessary component of a successful
users group so please don't be shy. The elections will take place in March.

  That's about it this month I hope you enjoy the new newsletter.

@{b}Dusting the Library Shelves@{ub}

by Mark Wegener

  As we all well know by now NOTHING HAS HAPPENED!  The charred remains of
the big C= are still being fought over and as some of you already know our
wonderful buddies Irving Gould and Mehdi Ali have jumped back into the
fight.  Just when we thought things couldn't get worse... They have I
think it's kind of ironic don't you.  I've always been an eternal optimist
when it comes to the Amiga (aren't we all) but the only thing I can think
of to do now is sit back and laugh at the whole situation.

  How does this affect us well as some people might have heard the makers
of DirectoryOpus and Gigamem are calling it quits but on the lighter side
Aminet continues to grow and more shareware/PD stuff is being created now
more than ever.  The important thing about the great "Programmers-on-the-fly"
is that we must support them, if their program, game, utility, whatever is
decent pay them the 5 bucks or so that they are asking it's only fair in
my opinion (card-ware is fun too.)

  If YOU have created a program, share it with us by entering it into the
library, we would be the cheapest beta testers in the world.

  I can't stress enough that right now more than ever we need to support the
group and the best way to do this is by buying library disks.  The Amiga
users of the Heartland has the best software library around and the disks
are still only 3 DOLLARS.

@node NOTES_EDITOR "Notes from the Editor of AUoH"

Pretty obvious that we've changed formats for the newsletter. For more
detailed reasoning, please read the articles from either @{" Ron " link NOTES_PRESIDENT} or @{" Greg " link EDITOR_MUMBLES}.

Also, since this is the first issue of the newsletter in AmigaGuide
format, be ready for the inevitable growing pains associated with getting
the newsletter in true fighting form.

Please feel free to let me know what you'd like to see different with this
format of the newsletter. If nobody says anything they'd like to see
different (with good reasoning), then I'll just assume that the formatting
is fine. I'm sure I'll be making changes in the future though. I'm just
not able to leave well enough alone. :)

Something that I would like to see would be an icon designed for the
newsletter that in some way lets the reader know that this newsletter is
both AmigaGuide and AUoH. Anybody care to take a whack at it?

@{b}As the Editor Mumbles@{ub}

by Greg Gerke

Yeah, yeah, I know. The Amiga's fate is still being held hostage by
lawyers and other money grubbers that are more concerned about wringing
the last few sheckels out of the corpse of Commodore than the people that
have stood behind the Amiga for so long. One of the latest tidbits in the
press is that Mehdi and Irv have filed some sort of motion that is their
attempt to halt investigating where the money went before the final fall
of Commodore. Apparently Bahamian law only allows investigators to go back
a maximum of three months where US law allows six months. Anybody care to
make a wager on why "Dumb and Dumber" don't want people to know about the
past financial dealings of Commodore? No, I'm not bitter.

I've called the AmigaWorld hotline (603-924-2195) to get the latest news
on the sale of C=. The message (from February 10th) says that there were
two new updates concerning the sale. First was that lawyers for Ali and
Gould have challenged the settlement of the proceedings to be held in a US
court. Because of an emergency on the part of one of the judges the case
will reconvene on the 23rd of February. Second, and much more interesting,
is that two new players may be in on the bidding. One is from a German
firm and the other is a group that is representing a person from Seattle.

It just keeps getting stranger and stranger.

@{b}Slight Change in the Newsletter @{ub}

Hopefully you've noticed that there's been a slight change in the format
of the newsletter. The reasons for this are purely financial. The printing
and mailing of the newsletters was running us roughly $150 dollars a month
and the money coming in (new members, renewals, and disk sales) just plain
wasn't enough to cover that drain. Believe me, the exec board has debated
long and hard on how best to get the newsletter into your hands.

This wasn't a popular choice among the exec members and I'm sure it's not
going to be one with you, gentle reader. I'd prefer to stay with the paper
format of the newsletter (I enjoy getting something in the mail other than
bills myself, even if it is basically something I mailed to myself :). But
reality hits here. If we don't have the funds to support paper then we
can't use paper. I mean, it's not like we're the government and take out
loans that we can't afford, right?

@{b}What's New?@{ub}

Well, no new commercial software. But of course, that doesn't mean
anything when you've got sources such as Aminet and the rest of the
Internet. There's tons of great software out there and hopefully you've
got the means of getting at it.

I can hear you asking yourself, "Oh sure, he @{b}SAYS@{ub} there's tons of
great software, but I don't see him giving me any examples!" Wrong,
non-preemptive multitasking breath!

One program that I just recently found a use for is a little ditty called
ImageDex (currently at version 2.4). What this program does is take a
group of files and make an index out of them. The program does this by
taking each picture of a series of pictures and shrinking it down so that
you can get multiple pictures on a page. Why would you want to do this?
I'll list two good reasons:

- You have a collection of floppies and you'd like to save an easy
  reference picture in case you want to go back and find a particular
  picture.
- You have a CD full of pictures (a Sci-Fi picture disk in my case) and
  you'd like to have an easier way of finding the picture you need instead
  of hunting for one.

ImageDex requires that you have Art Department Pro (because ADPro can
import and export eleventy billion formats and why reinvent the wheel when
you can use the power of the Amiga and it's ability to share resources).
Oh, and have I said that the author is on the Internet and replies to his
mail in this column yet? Well, here's another example. The author, Zach
Williams (zachws@ids.net) is quite responsive to questions and
suggestions. And I've sent him the measly $15 to register and get the
extra neat features. If you have a need to do either of the above I'd
recommend getting it.

Another obvious piece of shareware is the venerable VirusChecker (current
at version 2.51 as I write this but it may have been updated by the time
you read this). I've used VirusChecker for years and have never personally
had a problem with it. And it has found a couple of virii in that time,
too. Think of it as insurance policy to protect against the nutcases of
the world.

There are always new, interesting pieces of shareware coming out all the
time. Some are small, tiny utilities that fill a specific niche. Others
are mega utilities that cover many areas. But all give you the opportunity
of trying them as soon as they can be transferred from the local BBS or
Internet FTP site. And if you don't like them there's no hassle returning
it. Just delete it and go on. But if you do use something enough, please
support the shareware authors and give those few dollars that they ask.

@{b}In conclusion@{ub}

It's pretty much a joke to say that we'll here something anytime soon. I
mean, we're getting dangerously close to the one year mark on this whole
sorry affair. I see IBM advertising OS/2 Warp heavily in magazines and TV
(and I've even heard they've relaxed their dress code. Will wonders never
cease). I read about all the cool stuff that's getting added to the next
versions of the Macintosh OS and Windows 95/96/97 (and that we've had for
years but nobody outside of our clan seems to know about it). But I'm
still hangin' in there because I've looked at the alternatives and I
@{b}still@{ub} don't see anything that really makes me want to stray from
the path of computing rightousness.

@node IMPOSSIBLE_MISSION "Impossible Mission 2025"

Impossible Mission 2025

by John Haas

My son, Sean, and I have been racking up a  lot of computer time lately
playing Impossible Mission 2025. This is the third installment of the
popular game and the first to be produced by Microprose. IM 1 and 2, which
are fond memories from my Commodore 64 days, were published by the very
fine company Epyx which has, unfortunately, gone "belly up". I lamented
the passing of Epyx because I assumed that would be the end of the IM
series. I must admit to having been seriously addicted to IM 1. It's truly
a classic. IM 2, while visually a lot more interesting, never quite held
the charm of IM 1 (it had to be those puzzles!). It was still a fine
effort, however. IM 3 contains a lot of common threads from 1 and 2 but is
a quantum leap overall.

The graphics and motion are outstanding although it does tax my A600's
68000 processor a bit. Faster machines should have no such trouble. There
is an AGA version for you 1200 and 4000 owners. The game is not copy
protected and is hard drive installable although it does have the annoying
"manual" copy protection which means that when starting up you must turn
to a certain page of the manual and enter the four digit number at the
bottom of the page. The basic premiss is the same as IM 1 and 2. You must
search for key objects which will enable you to get to and stop the evil
Elvin Atombender. In this case, your goal is to find circuit board pieces
(9 per level) which must be assembled into a larger board which enables
you to ride an elevator to the next level. As always, you must outwit a
bizarre assortment of robots which Elvin has as security. The areas to be
searched are not rooms as in the past but vast areas with many platforms,
lifts and monorails. Once again, there are  computer terminals to sign-on
to (5 different kinds!). One of the terminals is very important because
that is where you assemble the 9 circuit board pieces into one large one.
This is done via a computerized version of the old sliding tile puzzles
we've all seen. Unfortunately, I never could do one of those puzzles to
save my soul. Microprose must have had me in mind because in the plethora
of objects that there are to be found, they included an "auto-solve" for
the puzzle.  And, as in the case of IM 2, there are objects (guns,
grenades, cloaking devices, jet packs, etc.) which can be collected and
which prove to be invaluable. While you can collect any number of items,
you can only carry and use three at a time. Special terminals allow you to
manage your inventory but you have to think ahead because they're not
always nearby.

The game has a good deal of complexity built-in and throws some unusual
things at you. One of the terminals is a sort of "shoot-em-up" video game
resembling a mini Galaga. Another reminds me of the music room in IM 1.
But instead of arranging notes from lowest to highest, you have to repeat
the pattern which increases by one each time.

The scene for the first three levels is a parking garage. After that it
switches to an office building. After that I can't say because the office
building is proving to be quite a challenge (there doesn't seem to be an
auto-solve for the circuit board puzzle)!

One of the more fun aspects of the game is the jet pack. This is very
realistic and takes some practice. Once airborne there are flying robots
which come after you and try to knock you out of the air. Lucky for you
the pack is equipped with a weapon so you can defend yourself. The jet
pack is important because some of the objects to be searched are up high
and it's the only way to get there. Watch your fuel level as you have a
limited amount and must, on some levels, be very frugal.

For each level there is a time limit and as always, you lose time when you
get yourself killed by a robot or fall.  This brings up another criticism
that I have and that is what happens to you after you are unfortunately
killed. The game "rematerializes" you at times a long way away from where
you were zapped -- usually at the last terminal that you signed on to. You
may have worked very hard to reach a certain location only to have it all
be for naught.

The manual is purposely vague in such areas as descriptions of the robots
you will encounter. This forces you to discover the capabilities and
dangers of certain types through trial and error.

I definitely recommend this game. It even includes IM 1 which for me was a
very pleasant surprise as I did not know this when I ordered it.

@node C_CLASS "C Programming Class"

@{b}'C' Tutorial@{ub}

by  M.Wooge

@{b}Part 9.0 Input.@{ub}

  This article tells how to get information from outside the program, and
send some from the program.

  Programs can get information from any of several places:  other
programs, hardware devices such as the keyboard or mouse, serial and
parallel ports, the command line, files, and other sources.

  This article covers input from the keyboard and command line.  Input
from external files will be covered in another article.  Input from ports
and hardware devices will not be covered.

@{b}Command-line Input.@{ub}

  A "command-line" is a line of text we type onto a CLI screen.  Consider
the CLI command:

copy X-File Y-File

  We tell CLI to run the program "copy" by typing the program name onto the
screen, and the name of the files.

  Try the following program:

#include <stdio.h>
main(argc, argv)
int argc; char *argv[];
{
  int count;

  for(count = 0; count < argc; count++)
    printf("%s\n", argv[count]);

  return(0);
}

  Run the program like so:

ProgName asdfg qwerty

  Remember, main() is a function just like any other function, and
arguments can be passed to it.  When a program is run, CLI passes two
arguments to main(), by tradition called argc and argv. These two
arguments let the programmer use the entire command line used to run the
program.

  @{b}argc@{ub} stands for argument count.  It is the number of arguments
passed to main().  More accuratly, it is the number of arguments minus
one, as C starts counting at zero.

  @{b}argv@{ub} is short for argument variables.  It is a list pointers to
the words in the command line.  argv[0] always points to the first word of
the command line, which will be the name of the program.

@{b}Console Input.@{ub}

  The "console" is the keyboard and monitor.  Use getchar() to get a
single character from the keyboard, and putchar() to print one to the
screen.

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
  char ch; /* a single character */

  printf("Type something, then press the return key. ");
  ch = getchar();
  putchar(ch);

  return(0);
}

  This program gets a character from the console and then prints it.
However, due to the way the Amiga's OS works, getchar() won't return until
you press the return key.  The program will just sit there.

  Notice there is no linefeed after printing the single character.  Use
putchar('\n') to print a linefeed character.

@{b}Use gets() and puts() to get and print strings.@{ub}

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
  char buff[250]; /* string storage */

  gets(buff);
  puts(buff);

  return(0);
}

  @{b}gets()@{ub} does no error checking, so be sure your input buffer is large
enough to hold the string entered.  Putting a hundred characters in a
string that's only 10 characters long can be disasterous.

  @{b}puts("ABC")@{ub} is the same as printf("ABC\n").  It always adds a linefeed
after the string, and can accept special characters.  puts("Two\nlines") is
legal.


  As always, if you have problems post a message on the local Amiga echo.
Post a description of the problem and the section of code you think is
causing the problem.

@{b}Lexicon:@{ub}
@{i}Command Line.@{ui} The entire text of a command.
@{i}Console.@{ui} The keyboard and monitor.
@{i}getc().@{ui} Get a character from the keyboard.
@{i}putc().@{ui} Print a single character to the monitor.

@{b}Toolbar for Term@{ub}

by Russ LeBar (c621412@showme.missouri.edu)

Finally, our usenet feed is back up for the moment. With that in mind,
please email me replies. Now onto business...

Over spring break, someone on IRC mentioned that a toolstrip would be
nice for term, and I said I'd mention to Olaf Barthel. Well, I did, and
got suckered into making the imagery for it...

So, this brings up a couple questions..

- How would you like to see the toolstrip setup? So far, it looks like
it'll have support for being horizontal or vertical, be in a window
(maybe on the screen, like the status bar is also, but I'm not sure). A
lot of people have suggested that it also be configurable (e.g. so you
can add arexx scripts to it), and Olaf agreed.

- You aren't going to like this too much, probably, but right now, it
looks like only 4-color icons will be supported, as this is the easiest
way to remap the imagery. The icon size will probably be fixed also -
25x25 counting the border (yell at me for this, it's the size I choose).
The current idea is to have Olaf read in the imagery from an iff ilbm
(picture or brush, not sure which yet). Then, there would be some prefs
panel like in Final Writer that would list all the imagery. I suggested
this because I was getting too many little brushes to work on, plus, I
had them all in a big brush, and I started changing imagery there
instead.

- The imagery itself. Well, I have the transfer and settings menu done,
plus reset terminal, break, hang-up, Fast! macros on/off, and the
phonebook. Anything else you'd kill to see in it? I was thinking of also
adding a bunch of amibiguous type icons like in FW also. I also have a
lot of the imagery that I've used more than once (e.g. the prefs symbol,
the transfer symbol, the monitor...) which I figured should be included
with the toolstrip imagery.

There is a sample iff of the current imagery on my ftp site as well as a
previos example which also has some discussion me and Olaf had as well as
some examples of other toolstrips (termite and several other pc/mac comm
programs).

The ftp site is musie.phlab.missouri.edu in pub/amiga/term/toolstrip/

Note that this is a work in progress, and also that I'm a volunteer (so
don't expect perfect icons!!!). Classes are starting up again, and my
time is limited. Insults to my imagery will only degrade my morale, which
means you have no hope of seeing any decent icons if my morale gets too
low. Praise will inspire me to continue on. Real suggestions will also
give me something to work on too...

Lastly, our usenet feed here is really f**ked up bad, so please, reply
to me via email (and make sure it's my showme account). You can also
catch me on irc occasionally as 'Argel.'

Thanks for your time!

@{b}DirectoryOpus v5 Info@{ub}

Dopus5 is currently in development, and is probably about a month or so from
completion.  Most of the code is finished and the graphics (icons etc) are
being completed next week.  Jonathan Potter is still the author and is
developing the new version under the auspices of GPSoftware in Brisbane.  (They
are the company who produce GP fax among other things).  Dopus 5 was
demonstrated recently in London at the World of Commodore show.  A number of
distributers have indicated they wish to handle the new version, but I cannot
identify any North American ones specifically.

The new version is apparently significantly more "graphical" in that actions
can be instituted via icons from the workbench if necessary and any number of
directory windows can be open at one time.  I understand that it has more of a
'tool bar' structure but I have not seen it as yet.

I don't know the upgrade path from Dopus 4 (ie how GP are handling this) and
unfortunately do not have their email address...but somebody else may be able
to help.

If you get no further response and wish to follow this up further let me know
and I will speak to Jonathan as I deal with him on another job regularly.

Hope this helps.

@node GIF "Controversy over GIF"

@{b}The End of the GIF-Giving Season@{ub}

by Geoff Duncan (geoff@tidbits.com)

@{i}(this text was retrieved from issues #259 and #260 of TidBITS, an
electronic magazine. send email to info@tidbits.com for more info)@{ui}

On January 3rd, 1995, an announcement appeared in CompuServe's
GRAPHSUPPORT forum that sent a shock wave through the online community.
Apparently, the popular GIF graphics file format was now proprietary and
users must have secured a license from CompuServe by January 10th in order
to keep using GIF files. As it turned out, this interpretation wasn't
entirely congruent with the truth, but that didn't stop the firestorm of
debate that ensued.

GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is a graphics file format introduced by
CompuServe in 1987. Its purpose was to enable users on multiple platforms
- Macs, PCs, Amigas, or whatever - to download and view pictures. Back in
the days of 1200 baud modems, GIFs were pretty much just time-consuming
curiosities. But as bandwidth increased, more tools became available, and
as the Internet and BBS communities expanded, GIF became the de facto
standard for distributing graphics online. Not surprisingly, it's also the
graphic format of choice for the World-Wide Web, and is the only graphics
format supported internally by the three major Macintosh Web browsers.
(Netscape also supports JPEG; see below.)

So why the controversy, especially over a file format that's been around
for years? The problem lies in the GIF format's use of LZW
(Lempel-Zev-Welch) compression and decompression. Graphic files can be
very large: a full-screen (640 x 480), 256-color image requires 2,457,600
bits of memory to be represented internally by your computer. (That
translates to about 300K.) In those days of 1200 baud modems, no one in
their right mind downloaded a 300K file just to see a picture. By making
use of LZW compression, however, that same file could be considerably
smaller in GIF format, although the exact amount of savings varied
depending on the picture. Suddenly downloading graphics became more
practical.

@{b}How Did We Get Here From There?@{ub}

The LZW compression method was originally published in a journal by a
Unisys engineer and was used by a number of developers (not just
CompuServe) for a variety of purposes. Unbeknownst to these developers,
Unisys later applied for a patent on the LZW compression technology. The
patent was granted in 1993.

Now here's where the debacle begins. Unisys, apparently, didn't bother to
make any public statement as to its licensing policy or intentions: it
merely called up major GIF-related developers - like CompuServe - and
started talking about infringement suits. These developers, caught by
Unisys's "submarine patent," began licensing negotiations. When CompuServe
negotiators reached an agreement with Unisys in mid-1994, they apparently
didn't bother to tell anybody either. They merely "initiated a process" to
secure a similar license that would benefit their community of GIF-related
developers.

When CompuServe managed to make an arrangement with Unisys whereby
developers could obtain a GIF license from CompuServe rather than Unisys
directly, all manner of chaos broke loose. First, "official" announcements
appearing in CompuServe's forums were often incomplete or misleading (one
even misspelled Unisys consistently). Second, it was unclear whether the
restrictions on the GIF format applied only to developers or also to
anyone @{u}using@{uu} the GIF format. GIFs are used almost everywhere,
especially on the World-Wide Web. If the GIF file format was no longer
free to use, literally tens of thousands of WWW sites, software programs,
and images would have to be licensed, recalled, or go offline until the
images could be licensed or replaced.

Several interpretations of the badly-phrased CompuServe announcements
began to circulate on the Internet. Unisys probably got off a little
easier because many people thought it was all CompuServe's fault, but
newsgroup threads and email flew thick and furious. Some felt the
agreement was irrelevant, since Unisys could never prosecute everyone
using the GIF format. Some heralded the death of the GIF, and still others
thought the whole thing was a joke, especially in the wake of the recent
"Good Times" virus hoax. Wags even updated the popular line to "Death of
the Net Predicted - JPEG at 11."

@{b}What's the Deal?@{ub}

Eventually, Unisys and CompuServe issued press releases and clarifications:

1) Unisys is requiring all software developers using the GIF format in
   "commercial, for-profit" software to obtain licenses. This means that
   users viewing and distributing GIF files are in the clear, as are
   freeware and non-profit applications.

2) CompuServe has provided an optional licensing agreement that can be
   used by developers of software "primarily for use with the CompuServe
   Information Service" rather than dealing with Unisys directly.

One upshot of #1, above, is that graphics programs and commercial WWW
browsers which read or write the GIF format (like Photoshop and Netscape)
will have to obtain licenses in order to continue using GIF. Some people
think this will be a big problem, others see it as a side issue since some
of these developers (like Adobe) already license the TIFF format from
Unisys. The debate has also sparked interest in replacements for the GIF
format. A commonly suggested alternative has been JPEG, which typically
achieves far better compression than GIF and can use 24-bit color (GIF is
limited to 256-color images). The difficulty with JPEG is that it's a
"lossy" compression format: it throws out some data in order to achieve
better compression. Other formats receiving attention include PBF, GEF,
and FGF (variants or deliberate replacements for GIF).

@{b}Lessons Learned?@{ub}

Unisys's filing for a patent of the LZW technology after the GIF format
had been widely adopted by the computer industry is, to say the least,
questionable. Threatening to file infringement suits after seven years of
encouraged use of the GIF format is, to say the least, highly
questionable. Many companies and developers have found themselves in a
position of having been unwitting partners to Unisys. This has damaged
these companies' reputations and relationships with their developers; even
without that, I'm sure Unisys's actions wouldn't make them happy.

Further, you'd think that after watching Intel get nailed by the
commercial and Internet communities during the Pentium fiasco, Unisys and
CompuServe - companies specializing in information technology - would have
gone to some effort to make their policies and intentions clear online.
Although Unisys did eventually release a decent clarification and
CompuServe seems to have finally gotten its message across, engendering
that amount of rhetoric, rage, and misinformation can at the very least be
viewed as irresponsible, possibly inexcusable. Eventually, companies and
vendors will learn not to turn a blind side to the Internet community;
however, until that day they will have to be content to take their bruises.

@{b}GIF Gaffe@{ub}

Our article on the recent Unisys/CompuServe GIF fiasco contained a few
misstatements. First, Unisys's patent on the LZW compression method was
effective in 1985, not 1993 as stated in the article. Second, the TIFF
file format is not itself licensed from Unisys, but the LZW method used in
the TIFF format is licensed from Unisys.

Notwithstanding, the LZW compression format was first published in June of
1984, calling into question Unisys's subsequent application for a patent
on the method. Also, while CompuServe can be accused of many things,
making a secret of LZW's use in the GIF format is not one of them. It
remains astounding that Unisys overlooked the (increasingly widespread)
GIF file format for seven years.

CompuServe announced last week plans to serve as the coordinator of a new
"free and open" GIF24 standard. GIF24 will support 24- bit, lossless
compression and will presumably be free of proprietary technology. [GD]

Hello everybody.  I was preparing to give a short AmigaDOS tutorial
at the next AUoH meeting when an I had an Idea.  Why not use the club
AmigaGuide newsletter to provide some expanded information related to
my talk?  Brace yourself...

This tutorial uses an AmigaDOS script and program I wrote.  I hope it
illustrates some scripting basics and how to use a few of the utility
programs in your C: directory.

You may want to open a Shell window and run the example script a few
times before going further.  This may make more sense once you've
seen it in action; be sure to click a different gadget each time.

To run the script:

	- Open a Shell window

	- Go to the directory that contains the tutorial files.

		1> CD auoh:mdg

	- Run the example script

		1> EXECUTE RequestTest

Note that my Request program requires AmigaDOS 2 or greater!

@{" failat 11 " link man.failat}

This line changes the Fail Limit of this script from the default
value of 10 to 11.  The next command can possibly have a return code
equal to 10 which would normally cause the script to abort.  In this
case I know it's a valid result and have to tell the Shell to relax
unless a command returns a value of 11 or greater.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

@{" Request \"Click one\" title \"Hello, World!\" gadgets \"A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K\" " link man.request}

This line executes my Request program.  It puts up a window with some
text, a customized title bar message, and 11 gadgets (each containing
a single letter).  The script pauses until you, the user, clicks on
one of the gadgets.

It sets a Return Code that indicates which button you clicked on.  If
you click on the 'A' button the return code is 1, the 'B' button
returns '2', and so forth up to 'J' which returns 10.  The right-most
button is different, it's return value is 0.  For the reasoning
behind that last bit please refer to the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference
Manual, Includes and AutoDocs, intuition.library/EasyRequest().

----------------------------------------------------------------------

@{" set choice $rc " link man.set}

This line saves the @{b}Return Code@{ub} of the previous command.  Every command
has a return code, by convention a value of 0 means the command ran
successfully.  Higher values can indicate an error condition or
just some additional information that the command wants to
communicate to the caller.

I want to use this feedback from the Request command later in the
script.  It must be saved right now because the Return Code is
changed after every command (including this one).

The environment variable RC is automagically maintained by the Shell.
It holds the Return Code of each command as they execute.  Notice the
use of the dollar sign to get the value of the RC variable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

@{" if $choice eq 0 " link man.if}

This line tests the value of an environment variable.  It compares the
contents of the variable named 'choice' (which I saved previously) to
the string '0'. If they are equal, the folling command is executed.
Otherwise, we skip forward to the line following the next @{b}EndIf@{ub}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	@{" echo \"Last button\" " link man.echo}

This line prints a string to the Shell window.  Note that the string
is enclosed in quotation marks.  They are required because the string
contains an embedded space character.  The quotes just delimit the
string and are not printed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

@{" endif " link man.endif}

This line marks the end of an @{b}IF@{ub} block.  It lets the Shell know where
to continue execution if the @{b}IF@{ub} condition was not true.  It causes no
action by itself other than affecting the Return Code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

@{" if $choice eq 1 " link man.if}

This line is very much like the previous @{b}IF@{ub} statement.  The only
difference is comparing the environment variable with the string '1'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	@{" echo \"First button\" " link man.echo}

This should look familiar.  Look back three lines.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

@{" endif " link man.endif}

Ditto...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

@{" if val $choice ge 2 " link man.if}

This @{b}IF@{ub} statement is a little different.  Instead of testing for
equality, the comparison is {greater than or equal to}.  It also uses
the @{b}VAL@{ub} keyword which indicates a numeric comparison.

By default, comparisons are done as strings (character by character).
Imagine the strings '10' and '2'; in a dictionary the first string
would appear before the second because the first character '1' comes
before '2'.  We know the value '10' is numerically larger than '2'
and must use the @{b}VAL@{ub} keyword to perform this type of compare.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	@{" echo \"Button\" $choice " link man.echo}

Yet another ECHO command.  In this case we want to print the word
"Button" followed by the value contained in an environment variable.
Hence the use of the dollar sign followed by our variable name.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

@{" endif " link man.endif}

This line ends the previous @{b}IF@{ub} block.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

@{" unset choice " link man.unset}

We no longer need that environment variable.  This line will remove
it and free the memory needed took to store it.  Always remember to
clean up after yourself...

FROM/M indicates that multiple arguments are acceptable.

TO/A indicates that the argument must be given.

ALL/S, QUIET/S, CLONE/S, DATE/S, NOPRO/S, COM/S, NOREQ/S indicate
that the keywords act as switches.  If the keyword is present in the

PURPOSE

	Things change.  Software gnomes are beavering away right now,

	But how do you choose from multiple different copies of some
	important runtime library or device driver?  That can be a

	Version strings are a Commodore standard way to embed
	information inside programs, libraries, or other files.  You

	The "$VER:" part must appear exactly as shown.  Next comes a
	space, the file name (no embedded spaces), version number, a

PURPOSE

	To display a string.

SPECIFICATION

	@{b}ECHO@{ub} writes the specified string to the current output window
	or device, usually the screen.  By using the TO option, you
	can send the string to a device or file.  When the string
	contains spaces, the whole string must be enclosed in double
	quotes.  (@{b}ECHO@{ub} is commonly used in scripts.)

	When the NOLINE option is specified, @{b}ECHO@{ub} does not
	automatically move the cursor to the next line after printing
	the string.

	The FIRST and LEN options allow the echoing of a substring.
	FIRST <n> indicates the character position to begin the echo;
	LEN <n> indicates the number of characters of the substring
	to echo, beginning with the first character.  If the FIRST
	option is omitted and only the LEN keyword is given, the
	substring printed will consist of the rightmost <n>
	characters of the main string.  For instance, if your string
	is 20 characters long and you specify LEN 4, the 17th, 18th,
	19th, and 20th characters of the string will be echoed.

	alternative action in case the @{b}IF@{ub} condition is not true.  If
	the @{b}IF@{ub} condition is not true, execution of the script will
	jump from the @{b}IF@{ub} line to the line after @{b}ELSE@{ub}; all
	intervening commands will be skipped.  If the @{b}IF@{ub} condition is
	true, the commands immediately following the @{b}IF@{ub} statement are
	executed up to the @{b}ELSE@{ub}.  Then, execution skips to the @{b}ENDIF@{ub}
	statement that concludes the @{b}IF@{ub} block.

EXAMPLE

	Assume a script, called Display, contained the following
	block:

		@{b}IF@{ub} exists <name>
		  @{b}TYPE@{ub} <name> OPT n
		@{b}ELSE@{ub}
		  @{b}ECHO@{ub} "<name> is not in this directory"
		@{b}ENDIF@{ub}

	To execute this script, you could type:

		1> @{b}EXECUTE@{ub} Display work/prg2

	If the work/prg2 file can be found in the current directory,
	the @{i}TYPE <name> OPT n@{ui} command will be executed.  The
	@{i}work/prg2@{ui} fill will be displayed on the screen with line
	numbers.

	If the @{i}work/prg2@{ui} file cannot be found in the current
	directory, the script will skip ahead to the @{i}ECHO "<name> is
	not in this directory"@{ui} command.  The message:

		work/prg2 is not in this directory

	will be displayed in the Shell window.

TEMPLATE

PURPOSE

	To terminate an IF block in a script file.

SPECIFICATION

	@{b}ENDIF@{ub} is used in scripts at the end of an @{b}IF@{ub} block.  If the
	@{b}IF@{ub} condition is not true, or if the true condition commands
	were executed and an @{b}ELSE@{ub} has been encountered, the execution
	of the script will skip to the next @{b}ENDIF@{ub} command.  Every @{b}IF@{ub}
	statement must be terminated by an @{b}ENDIF@{ub}.

	The @{b}ENDIF@{ub} applies to the most recent @{b}IF@{ub} or @{b}ELSE@{ub} command.

@NODE man.failat "Failat"
COMMAND

	Failat

TEMPLATE

	RCLIM/N

PURPOSE

	To instruct a command sequence to fail if a program gives a
	return code greater than or equal to the given value.

SPECIFICATION

	Commands indicate that they have failed in some way by
	setting a return code.  A nonzero return code indicates that
	the command has encountered an error of some sort.  The
	return code, normally 5, 10, or 20, indicates how serious the
	error was. A return code greater than or equal to a certain
	limit, the 'fail limit', terminates a sequence of
	non-interactive commands (commands you specify after @{" RUN " link man.run} or
	in a script.

	You may use the @{b}FAILAT@{ub} command to alter the fail limit RCLIM
	(Return Code Limit) from its initial value of 10.  If you
	increase the limit, you indicate that certain classes of
	error should not be regarded as fatal and that execution of
	subsequent commands may proceed after an error.  The argument
	must be a positive number.  The fail limit is reset to the
	initial value of 10 on exit from the command sequence.

	If the argument is ommited, the current fail limit is
	displayed.

EXAMPLE

	Assume a script contains the following lines:

		@{b}COPY@{ub} DF0:MyFile to RAM:
		@{b}ECHO@{ub} "MyFile being copied."

	If @{i}MyFile@{ui} cannot be found, the script will be aborted and the
	following message will appear in the Shell window.

		COPY: object not found
		COPY failed returncode 20:

	However, if you change the return code limit to higher than
	20, the script would continue even if the @{" COPY " link man.copy} command fails.
	For instance, if you changed the script to read:

		@{b}FAILAT@{ub} 21
		@{b}COPY@{ub} DF0:MyFile to RAM:
		@{b}ECHO@{ub} "MyFile being copied."

	even if @{i}MyFile@{ui} cannot be found, the script will continue.
	The following message will appear in the Shell window:

		COPY: object not found
		MyFile being copied.

@NODE man.if "If"
COMMAND

	If

TEMPLATE

	NOT/S,WARN/S,ERROR/S,FAIL/S,,EQ/K,GT/K,GE/K,VAL/S,EXISTS/K

PURPOSE

	To evaluate conditional operations in script files.

SPECIFICATION

	In a script file, @{b}IF@{ub}, when its condition is true, carries out
	all the subsequent commands until an @{b}ENDIF@{ub} or @{b}ELSE@{ub} command is
	found.  When the conditional is not true, execution skips
	directly to the @{b}ENDIF@{ub} or to an @{b}ELSE@{ub}.  The conditions and
	commands in @{b}IF@{ub} and @{b}ELSE@{ub} blocks can span more than one line
	before their corresponding @{b}ENDIF@{ub}s.

	Following are some of the ways you can use the @{b}IF@{ub}, @{b}ELSE@{ub} and
	@{b}ENDIF@{ub} commands.

		@{b}IF@{ub} <condition>
			<command(s)>
		@{b}ENDIF@{ub}

		------------------------

		@{b}IF@{ub} <condition>
			<command(s)>
		@{b}ELSE@{ub}
			<command(s)>
		@{b}ENDIF@{ub}

		------------------------

		@{b}IF@{ub} <condition>
			<command(s)>
		@{b}IF@{ub} <condition>
			<command(s)>
		@{b}ENDIF@{ub}
		@{b}ENDIF@{ub}

	@{b}ELSE@{ub} is optional, and nested @{b}IF@{ub}s jump to the nearest @{b}ENDIF@{ub}.

	The additional keywords are as follows:

		@{b}NOT@{ub}		Reverses the interpretation of the
				result.

		@{b}WARN@{ub}		True if previous return code is
				greater than or equal to 5.

		@{b}ERROR@{ub}		True if previous return code is
				greater than or equal to 10; only
				available if you set @{b}FAILAT@{ub} to
				greater than 10.

		@{b}FAIL@{ub}		True if previous return code is
				greater than or equal to 20; only
				available if you set @{b}FAILAT@{ub} to
				greater than 20.

		<a> @{b}EQ@{ub} <b>	True if the text of a and b are
				identical (disregaurding case).

		@{b}EXISTS@{ub} <file>	True if the file exists.

	If more than one of the three condition-flag keywords (WARN,
	ERROR, FAIL) are given, the one with the lowest value is
	used.

	@{b}IF@{ub} supports the @{b}GT@{ub} (greater than) and @{b}GE@{ub} (greater than or
	equal to) comparisons.  Normally, the comparisons are
	performed as string comparisons. However, if the @{b}VAL@{ub} option
	is specified, the comparison is a numeric comparison.

	NOTE: You can use @{b}NOT GE@{ub} for @{b}LT@{ub} and @{b}NOT GT@{ub} for @{b}LE@{ub}.

	You can use local or global variables with @{b}IF@{ub} by prefacing
	the variable name with a @{b}$@{ub} character.

EXAMPLES

		@{b}IF@{ub} EXISTS work/prog
		@{b}TYPE@{ub} work/prog
		@{b}ELSE@{ub}
		@{b}ECHO@{ub} "It's not here"
		@{b}ENDIF@{ub}

	If the file @{i}work/prog@{ui} exists in the current directory, then
	AmigaDOS displays it.  Otherwise, AmigaDOS displays the
	message @{i}It's not here@{ui} and continues after the @{b}ENDIF@{ub}.

		@{b}IF@{ub} ERROR
		@{b}SKIP@{ub} errlab
		@{b}ENDIF@{ub}
		@{b}ECHO@{ub} "No error"
		@{b}LAB@{ub} errlab

	If the previous command produced a return code greater than
	or equal to 10 then AmigaDOS skips over the @{b}ECHO@{ub} command to
	the @{i}errlab@{ui} label.

SPECIFICATION

	LAB is used in scripts to define a label that is looked for

	but must be alphanumeric characters.  No symbols are allowed.
	If the <string> contains spaces, it must be enclosed in

@NODE man.quit "Quit"
COMMAND

	Quit

TEMPLATE

	RC/N

PURPOSE

	To exit from a script file with a specified return code.

SPECIFICATION

	@{b}QUIT@{ub} is used to stop the execution of the script and set the
	specified return code.  The default return code is zero.  It
	is recommended that you use the standard return code values
	of 5, 10, and 20.

EXAMPLE

		@{b}ASK@{ub} "Do you want to stop now?"
		@{b}IF@{ub} WARN
		@{b}QUIT@{ub}
		@{b}ENDIF@{ub}
		@{b}ECHO@{ub} "Ok, the script is continuing."

	If you press Y at the prompt, the script will be aborted, as
	WARN is equal to a return code of 5.  If you press N or press
	return:

		Ok, the script is continuing.

	willl be displayed in the Shell window.
@ENDNODE

@NODE man.request "Request"
COMMAND

	Request

TEMPLATE

	MESSAGE/A,TITLE/K,GADGETS/K

PURPOSE

	To present a requester window and wait for a user to click on
	an option gadget.

SPECIFICATION

	@{b}REQUEST@{ub} allows a script file to ask for user-input using
	familiar Amiga window/gadgets/mouse features.  A requester
	window with gadgets is displayed and a numeric value is
	returned representing the gadget the user clicked.

	The arguments are as follows:

		MESSAGE		The text to be displayed in the
				requester window.  Multi-line text
				can be specified with the characters
				*n.  Each occurance of the two
				characters *n will create a new line.

		TITLE <text>	The text to be displayed in the title
				bar of the requester window.  If not
				specified, the default title bar is
				"User Request".

		GADGETS <text>	The text of the choice gadgets.  This
				is a single string with the different
				gadgets separated by the vertical bar
				character (|).  If not specified, the
				default choice gadgets are
				"Okay|Cancel".

	If an argument string contains spaces, it must be enclosed in
	quotation marks.

	The @{b}Return Code@{ub} is set to indicate which gadget the user
	clicked on.  The possible values are 0, 1, ..., N; where N
	is (gadgets - 1).  Note that the numbering is actually
	1,2,...,N,0; the left-most gadget returns 1 while the
	right-most gadget returns 0.  This is due to the way the ROM
	EasyRequest function works, live with it.

CAVEAT

	If your @{b}REQUEST@{b} contains 11 or more gadgets, be prepared for
	a return code of 10 or more.  AmigaDOS would normally abort a
	script with a return code this high.  In this situation,
	simply set @{" FAILAT " link man.failat} greater than or equal to the number of
	gadgets you present.

@NODE man.set "Set"
@NEXT man.unset
COMMAND

	Set

TEMPLATE

	NAME,STRING/F

PURPOSE

	To set a local variable.

SPECIFICATION

	@{b}SET@{ub} with <name> and <string> arguments creates a new
	environment variable.  The first word after SET is taken as
	the <name>.  Everything else on the command line is taken as
	the <string> argument.  Quotation marks are not required.

	@{b}SET@{ub} with no arguments lists the current local variables.

	An environment variable created with @{b}SET@{ub} is local to the
	Shell in which it was created.  If you create a new Shell
	with the @{" NEWSHELL " link man.newshell} command, that Shell will also recognize any
	variables created in its parent Shell.  However, if you
	create a new shell with the 'Execute Command' menu item or by
	opening the Shell icon, variables created with @{b}SET@{ub} will not
	be recognized.

	You can call environment variables in a script or on a
	command line by placing a dollar sign ($) in front of the
	variable name.

EXAMPLE

	1> @{b}SET@{ub} origin This process launched from icon

	creates the local variable @{i}origin@{ui} which stores a reminder
	that a Shell was invoked from an icon rather than a @{" NEWSHELL " link man.newshell}.

	1> @{b}ECHO@{ub} $origin
	This process launched from an icon

PURPOSE

@NEXT MAIN
NAME

	Version

TEMPLATE

	NAME,VERSION/N,REVISION/N,UNIT/N,FILE/S,INTERNAL/S,RES/S,FULL/S

PURPOSE

	To find software version and revision numbers

SPECIFICATION

	@{b}VERSION@{ub} finds the version and revision number of a library,
	device, command, or Workbench disk.  @{b}VERSION@{ub} can also test
	for a specific version/revision and set the condition flags
	if the version/revision is greater.  This is useful in
	scripts.

	@{b}VERSION@{ub} with no <library|device|file> argument prints the
	Kickstart version number and the Workbench version number and
	sets the environment variables.  If a name is specified,
	version attempts to open the library, device, drive, or file
	and read the version information.  You can get the version of
	the filesystem by specifying a drive name, such as DF0: or
	DH0:.

	When a <version #> (and possibly a <revision #>) is
	specified, @{b}VERSION@{ub} sets the condition flag to 0 if the
	version (and revision) number of the Kickstart, library,
	device driver is greater than or equal to the specified
	values.  Otherwise, the flag is set to 5 (WARN).  (If a
	revision number is not specified, no comparison on the
	revision number is performed.)

	The <unit #> option allows you to specify a unit number other
	than 0.  This may be necessary for accessing multi-unit
	devices.

	The FILE option forces @{b}VERSION@{ub} to inspect the object as a
	file, even if it is a library or device.  The INTERNAL and
	RES options let you get the version of the Internal and
	Resident commands, respectively.  Built-in Shell commands
	will have the same version string as the Shell itself.
	INTERNAL can also be used to find the version of a RAM module
	(library or device) without opening the device or library.
	The FULL option prints out the complete version string,
	including the date.

EXAMPLES

	1> @{b}VERSION@{ub}
	Kickstart version 37.175, Workbench version 38.35

	1> @{b}VERSION@{ub} SYS:Prefs/Font FULL
	font 38.21 (29.4.92)

@node BETA "Beta information"

This is simply an area that I keep just so I can keep track of what I've
changed in the past with the newsletter. You probably won't see a button
for it because it's not really newsletter information.

History

0.3 - Shifted opening page around to fit better on a standard interlace
        screen
      Updated phone book
      Removed "beta" button
0.2 - changes from the original
      added strangely placed "beta" button (will be removed)
      Ron made a new meeting map ("AUoH Info"/"Meeting Map")
      added "Library" button to front page
      changed front page logo (it's just not as easy to get something
        that looks as nice as printed text via AmigaGuide)
      added names of exec officers next to buttons
      forced "topaz 8" to be the font to display for consistancy
0.1 - initial release
