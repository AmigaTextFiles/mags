<CENTER><H1><I>Editor's Notes...</I></H1></CENTER>
<P>Well, it's been just over a month, and here we are again. I'd like to start off by thanking all of you 
who helped to make our first issue a success; your interest is appreciated, and it is our goal to 
continue to earn it in the future.</P>
<P>The last month has been an interesting one; let's just say it's amazing to see how fast one 
person's email traffic can increase in such a short time ;).</P>
<P>Seriously, though, the interest and feedback were appreciated; in general, all contact with you, 
the readers, helps to improve this magazine. This has, of course, been a time of developing and 
implementing a working system of bureacracy by which we can efficiently and effectively manage all 
AM-related business. This system is much-improved from a month ago, but is, of course, still in its 
early stages. So I ask that you bear with us if there has been any delay or omission in processing 
your communications with us; we're working on it, and we appreciate your patience in working with 
this issue.</P>
<P>As a result of requests and inquiries from a number of readers, we have added several new 
"features" to the magazine: there are now mailing lists for distribution of the magazine, as well as a 
well-defined policy on the addition of new mirror sites, in addition to a current list thereof. In addition, I 
am happy to say that the HTML code, while still IBrowse-Enhanced, is now significantly more 
Netscape-friendly. If you detect any major formatting errors, feel free to let us know, as we endeavor 
to iron out all the bugs and make the magazine more widely-readable. Oh, yes, I can also tell you that 
you shouldn't be able to find any stray hyphens in this issue ;).</P>
<P>With that, I'm going to leave the rest up to our contributors for now, and hope you enjoy reading 
the second issue of The Amiga Monitor.</P>
