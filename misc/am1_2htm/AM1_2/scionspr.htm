<P>The popularity of what I like to call "god games" is truly a phenomenon to behold.

There is something in us that simply enjoys telling little computer generated people what

to do and them having no choice but to do it. A resurgence of this genre of game has come

about by the release of the Warcraft series of CD-ROM games for the PC. This is basically

Populous, Settlers and Powermonger rolled into a neat package with lots of graphics and

sound to round it out. Since Warmonger has rolled up the charts, some Amiga programmers

have started releasing map makers for this type of game to see if people are interested.

Well, the folks at DSP have decided to one-up them and release a preview of what they

expect their game to be like. All of the graphics aren't done, it's only two levels, and

not all of the options are done yet. These notwithstanding, it is a promising preview.</P>

<P>Gameplay is easy. You click the mouse on any subject or building and a group of buttons

appears on the right. From here you can tell workers to move to a certain location, start

cutting down trees for lumber(an important commodity), and build buildings (what the lumber

is for). You start with three buildings, three workers, and one armed guard. The object is

to build up your population and army and then wipe out the other tribes. Adding the different

types of buildings allows you to increase the speed of growth of your population. Members of this

increased population are trained to be workers who can then be used to build more buildings or

can be armed and trained to fight at the blacksmith.</P>

<P>Fighting is simply a matter of moving your militia around until it encounters a member of

another tribe. You then click on the militia member, click on the button marked A, and then

click on the target of your anger. He then does the rest. </P>

<H3 ALIGN=center><B>Installation</B></H3>

<P>Download Scions.LHA from the Aminet. Dearchive it. Then use the included Installer script which

will take you the rest of the way. That done you have to run the setup program to select your

desired screenmode.</P>

<P>This game is looking pretty good. It is, however, important to remember that it is
a preview. It is not nearly finished yet. </P>
