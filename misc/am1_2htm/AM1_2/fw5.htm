<CENTER><H3>Basically...</H3></CENTER>

<P>I'm glad to know I can count on our readers to keep me on my toes.  Shortly after publication of 
the first issue, I received email messages from Nathan Morse of Columbus, Ohio, USA, and Allan 
Odgaard of Mayland fame (we will be taking a look at this new calendar/reminder program in an 
upcoming issue) informing me that I was wrong about some things.</P>

<P>Seriously, though, I am very thankful to those two for taking the time to point out my oversights.  It 
is, after all, our job to convey correct information, and it's good to see the readers raising their voices 
when we don't exactly do that.  I thereby extend the invitation to all of you to feel free to notify us if 
you detect an error.</P>

<P>Without further ado, let's get down to business.</P>

<CENTER><H3>What Was Wrong</H3></CENTER>

<P>The following clips are from the Final Writer 5 review in Volume 1 Issue 1 (August 1996) of The 
Amiga Monitor:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI><B>Multiple alignments on one line</B><BR>
Back, years ago, when I used WordPerfect for the Amiga, I remember frequently using left-aligned 
and right-aligned text on the same line in order to construct headings for school papers.   Unless I 
have missed something obvious, I have not found any way to do this with Final Writer, or any other 
word processor, for that matter.   I realize FW is a paragraph-oriented word processor, but it would be 
very convenient if it allowed multiple justifications of text on one line.
<LI><B>Autoscroll Virtual Screen</B><BR>
Final Writer should be able to open on an autoscroll virtual screen, just as the Workbench can.   It 
would be very convenient, especially for those of us for whom resolutions higher than 640x480 are 
still a dream...  
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>What I said wasn't exactly wrong, but it did represent some glaring omissions.</P>

<CENTER><H3>How It's Done</H3></CENTER>

<UL><LI><B>Multiple Alignments on One Line:</B> This is a simple matter of choosing the 
right-align tab stop from Final Writer's choice of several.  You can then use the Tab key to move from 
one to another.  Still, however, my original point stands, that compared to WP, this method is 
somewhat indirect, and it would be easier if the user could simply select a given alignment from the 
Left, Center, and Right choices for different parts of a line.  Just my opinion, however, I suppose.

<LI><B>Autoscroll Virtual Screen:</B> There are actually two ways to do this.  The first is to adjust 
the virtual screen settings on your Workbench, and then open Final Writer on the Workbench.  I was 
aware of that, but should have made my point clearer.  The second method also involves setting your 
Workbench to the desired size, and then select the "Same as Workbench" item in the Final Writer 
screenmode requester.  Neither method addresses the situation perfectly, however, as both can 
result in the colors getting messed up, which can make a visually complex program difficult, not to 
mention unsightly, to use.  It would still be best if Final Writer allowed the user to set the screen 
dimensions right in the opening requester, however.</UL>

<P>There you have it.  The record has been set straight.  In addition, I'd like to supplement the 
review with one additional complaint: Final Writer seems to have a nasty little bug that freezes the 
machine if you click the resize button during, or just after, opening another document once one is 
already open.  In other words, if FW is already running and you open an additional document window 
(and it comes up smaller than, and offset from, the first document window), and you click the resize 
gadget, your Amiga is likely to freeze right then and there.  No "Software Failure" requester, no "Guru 
Meditation" alert, just motionlessness.  Until this problem gets fixed somehow, I would advise you to 
wait until a document is fully loaded before resizing the window, and even then, save anything 
important before opening another document window.</P>

<P>So that (seemingly!) ends the ongoing saga of The Amiga Monitor and Final Writer 5.  I hope that, 
this time, we can put this whole affair (ahem!) behind us...and, incidentally, my recommendation for 
Final Writer 5 remains the same: it's one of the best things out there for Word Processing and 
Desktop Publishing...and it ain't too bad a text editor either...after all, you're reading this document, 
aren't you? ;-)</P>
