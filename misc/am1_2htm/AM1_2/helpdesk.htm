<CENTER><H3>A500 and Questions</H3></CENTER>

<P>Recently I bought a used A500 with 1.3 ROM, WB1.3, 1MB RAM.
Now the system has some changes: processor 68010, ECS, ROM 2.04 and
WB1.3 (it works with the 2.04 ROM, but the software-clock has problems).</P>

<P>I need to know:</P>

<P>a) Is it possible to use WB2.1 without a HD?</P>

<P>b) Is there a magazine related to Amiga computers in order to subscribe
to it? I need addresses or e-mails of Amiga magazines in order to subscribe to one
(or more) depending on what they have to offer. I need a sample issue of each
of them. Some Amiga users say, that most magazines are not published anymore.</P>

<P>c) Some amiga users say that a SCSI HD can not autoboot. Is this true?</P>

<B><P>Michael Webb says:</P>

<P>a) Yes, absolutely. You could even run WB3.1 on that system. You should be warned, however, 
that many modern applications won't be too happy with 1mb RAM and no HD. The OS itself, 
however, will run quite fine under those circumstances. Just be ready to swap disks frequently.</P>

<P>b) There are/have been a number of Amiga magazines, and the only one I know of that no longer 
exists is AmigaWorld. Today, probably your best bet for general Amiga coverage would be Amiga 
Computing (UK/International) and/or Amazing Computing/Amiga (USA). Here is all the information I 
have regarding contacting them:</P>

<P>As far as obtaining a sample issue goes...well, I suppose you could check newsstands, or the 
magazine section of a local bookstore. Or you might just find somebody advertising out on the 
internet to sell a whole bunch of old Amiga magazines for cheap, if they no longer have any use for 
them.</P>

<P>c) Not at all. The vast majority of SCSI HD's can autoboot, and the only exceptions, in general, 
are those made for pre-AmigaDOS 1.3 Amigas, since the 1.3 ROM was the first to support booting 
from something other than a floppy disk. So yes, a SCSI HD will autoboot, as long as your Amiga has 
AmigaDOS 1.3 or higher.</P>

<P>Greg Noggle says:</P>

<P>a) Yes,although you will be switching disks a lot, and be careful
what you put on what disk.</P>

<P>b) Amiga computing, Amazing Amiga</P>

<P>c) Some people don't know what they're talkng about. Yes, a SCSI HD can
be used as a autoboot drive. Use HD-Tools and check the autoboot
option. the only limitation I can see here would be the controller.</P>
