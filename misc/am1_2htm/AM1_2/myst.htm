<P ALIGN="left">Early this month Amiga users were treated to what looked like a miracle on the 
Aminet.
It was in the form of 20 Megs worth of files named Mystpreview. When dearchived onto your hard 
drive, it
looked, for all intents and purposes, like a one room demo of the Broderbund puzzle game that 
became one
of the first hit CD-ROM games. Many Amiga owners who saw this "preview," me included, began 
calling the
company for confirmation. Most were greeted as I was by their Tech and Customer Support 
personnel politely
denying that there were any plans to release an Amiga port of this game. We later learned that this 
was
done by a Polish programmer using the data files directly from the Broderbund CD. He was setting 
out
to prove how easy it is to port games of this type to the AGA amiga. This kind of game simply uses 
rendered
still images, small animations and sounds. The main draw of the game is the solving of numerous 
puzzles. The
AGA Amiga can easily show these images, and accelerated Amigas can easily display the 
animations as well as a
PC.</P>
<P ALIGN="left">This certainly got the attention of Broderbund, but is it the kind of attention we want? 
The
many calls to Broderbund could serve to show them that there is interest here for ports of the hit PC 
games.
The calls also, however, according to Broderbund's public relations department, caused confusion 
since no one
there knew where they were coming from. Has it gotten Broderbund to start releasing their games for 
the Amiga?
I doubt it but only time will tell that. If they do, we can expect to see other occurrences like this. We 
can
expect to see hoaxes like this anyway probably. I guess it is the nature of the Internet where anyone 
can post
anything. This leaves it up to us, the consumers, to make sure that what we are looking at is in fact 
what it
appears to be.</P>
<P ALIGN="left">What did this hoax accomplish exactly? Well, it did show that this type of game can 
be
easily ported to the Amiga. The last direct word I was able to receive, however, from Broderbund, is 
that they
still have no plans to produce software for the Amiga. Two unconfirmed letters from sources inside 
Broderbund
state that they are looking into the possibility due to the response. These letters were uploaded to 
Aminet,
the same place the Myst Preview hoax was uploaded. Due to this they can not be simply accepted as 
real without
other proof. Of course the only proof Amiga owners want is software on the shelves.</P>
<P ALIGN="left">Remember the old saying while you ply the Internet: If it looks too good to be true, it 
probably 
is.</P>
