<P ALIGN="LEFT">The leaves are starting to turn, the days are getting shorter, and there is a chill in the air. Yes, autumn is gradually setting in here in New York, and another summer is already memory. Another summer for us, and another summer for the Amiga. It was certainly an interesting one at that, as for arguably the first summer in years, the platform appeared to have a measure of stability, and solid, concrete hopes for the future.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, it was only a year ago that the Amiga's future was in serious jeopardy, the platform having felt the collapse of two corporate giants in too short a time for anything to have been accomplished in the interim. People were not quite sure what to think about VIScorp's potential involvement, and they were rightly concerned that there might not be anybody else out there looking to buy the Amiga technology, and actually carry it forward.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">But in a story that has practically become fable, or perhaps legend, Gateway 2000 swooped in, apparently out of nowhere, and for all intents and purposes, gave the Amiga at least a new lease on life.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">So we have been left to tread water for a few months, but I greatly admire Gateway and AI for not appeasing us with vaporware (with all due respect to the organization of the same name) and other empty promises. A lack of news is better than news without substance.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">But now, in only the last few weeks, Gateway has stepped forward and spoken to a certain degree on the future of the Amiga. We can now be fairly confident that there will be new computers bearing the Amiga name, and though specifics remain largely unknown, it appears that Gateway wishes to remain true to the Amiga philosophy. Once again, time will tell.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As far as the rest of this issue is concerned, you may have noticed that it is a combined August/September issue. We had to do this because of some timing, scheduling, and resource problems, which also caused some promised items to be bumped. They will appear here eventually, however.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">But yes, as the summer here fades away, let us remember that the Amiga's summer, so to speak, may only be beginning. One cannot make promises or bold assumptions, especially after everything the Amiga community has been through, but the platform might just now have its best chances yet. For the many who have not abandoned ship, you should be congratulated. You stuck with it, and all that waiting and hoping may soon pay off. In any event, we should soon have a better idea of just what "Tomorrow's Amiga" will be.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">For as it has been said, <I>summer can't last too long...</I></P>

<A HREF="samrpt.htm">The Sam Report: Amiga Online?</A><BR>
<B><I>By Sam Ormes</I></B><BR>
The world's largest online service is, without a doubt, America Online. However, it is an exclusive organization, available only for Mac OS and Windows users, and Amiga-only users need not apply. But in this day of a potential Amiga resurgence, one might argue that it is high time for AOL to be made available for the Amiga. Sam Ormes, Amiga user and AOL member, illustrates further.

<A HREF="ppc.htm">Guest Viewpoint: To PPC or not to PPC</A><BR>
<B><I>By Tim Molinder</I></B><BR>
As the Amiga prepares to move into the future, questions about processors for the next generation, and how to implement them, continue to be raised. The PowerPC is certainly among the most likely of contenders, but even then, exactly how to make the switch is not entirely clear.
