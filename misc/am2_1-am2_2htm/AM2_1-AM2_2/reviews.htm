<HR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Product reviews are as important a part of a magazine as any other. Although most products we review are those that we have purchased or otherwise obtained for our own purposes, we often review products at the request of the company or individual producing or developing them. If you have something you would like us to review at The Amiga Monitor, you can contact us about doing so.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you would like to contact the member of the staff most appropriate to the nature of your product directly, see the <A HREF="staff.htm">Staff List</A>. Otherwise, you can <A HREF="MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM">send e-mail to the Publisher.</P>
