Welcome to the March 1996 issue of the GAC FLAK!

This issue we have reviews of MegaBall4AGA and the Wizard. Both reviews
were written by Bob Scharp. We also have the second installment of
Barry's tales of woe (President's Corner), three press releases (two from
Amiga Technologies and one from Wonder Computers' Jason Compton), and FOUR
ADS! Well, OK, one's a classified from a member. You can't really count
that because it's free.

There are several oops's in this issue. Please be generous in your
critiqueing.

In the future (as PageStream3.1 Amiga reaches completion), this archive
will be reorganized with those of lower memory in mind. The
reorganization has already occured on the Publishing partition:

GAC_NL:                         Assign where all GAC FLAK information is
                                stored.

GAC_NL:Ads                      Advertising layouts to be imported to the
                                newsletter. In practice, they will simply
                                the source for external references within
                                the newsletter.

GAC_NL:ArticleText              Text of the articles in the current
                                issue.

GAC_NL:covers                   This one may be eliminated as the FLAK
                                will be going to a single document setup
                                since I recently upgraded to 18meg RAM.
                                Give me feedback on this as it may effect
                                your ability to load the newsletter.

GAC_NL:graphics                 All graphics will be here.

GAC_NL:inserts                  Late breaking news and articles that miss
                                the deadline closely.

GAC_NL:newsletters              The actual PageStream document goes here.

I am also playing with the idea of treating single printed pages as
single document pages instead of the way it is currently done. This will
depend upon Kinko's ability to accurately trim and join pages. It should
result in my being able to print closer to the edge of the page. I need
feedback on this as well since it will in the very least mean that those
of you printing copies from pagestream would have to do some trim and
join yourselves.

In all feedback, please use the subject line: `GAC FLAK Comments'. This
will make it easier for me to get quickly to your feedback.
