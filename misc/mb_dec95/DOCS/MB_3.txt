Hi  there  the  first  part  of the doc is on the reason for the delay of
MiggyByte  4  and  why  my  BBS went off line for a week.  After this the
usual news round up of little snippets not big enough to put in their own
articles.

What  a hectic month November was and I hope I never have to go through a
month  like  that again.  I know your all desperate to know why I thought
it was so bad so here goes.

First  off  one  day during a FidoNet import the Amiga went crazy and the
Hard  Drive took revenge for all the abuse I had given it.  What happened
was  a  total  nightmare  to  most sysops.  Every single file on the hard
drive  some  how became hashed.  I booted up DiskSalve and all it did was
take a look at the mess the hard drive and the files were in and shrugged
its  shoulders (well it would have if it had any).  So what this ment was
EVERY  file  on  the  hard drive was lost all the BBS files 5000+ and the
source code to MiggyByte and all my Uni work!

Thats it I thought, I give up.  For the next few days I walked round with
my  head  held  low  and anyone who asked what was wrong soon wished they
hadn't  as  I  spurted out my sob story (I suppose this is a good time to
say if any one mentions the word backup Ill kick their teeth in).  Anyhow
after a few days I started looking at the manual to Xenolink BBS software
that  had arrived a few days before the crash.  After studying the manual
I though this looks like fun, (I didn't really it looked like bloody hard
work)  so I decided to start up my BBS again.  At this point I must say a
big  thank  you  to Aaron Thorne and Rob Dale for the help in getting the
BBS  back  on-line so quick.  So within a week the BBS was back but sadly
with  a  rather  small file base of 200+ files.  But thanks to a few very
kewl users the BBS has already started to grow and a big thank you to you
all.

Of  course  in  the crash I lost the files etc for MiggyByte so a frantic
search  through  my  floppy collection and I found V0.98 of the MiggyByte
source  code.   This  was  a relief, but the version used in the November
issue  was  V1.09.   So I had to spend a few sleepless nights hacking the
code  to  get  it back to a usable standard but sadly its still not up to
the  V1.09 standard.  So if you find any bugs at all in this issue please
let me know as it hasn't been tested at all due to the time limit.

<<< Here is the news >>>

< Phase 5 >
Phase  5 are to make the new range of Power PC boards for the A1200/A4000
and  rumour  has  it that registered users of the Blizzard range of turbo
boards will be able to get an upgrade at a reduced price.

< Amiga Technologies >
Amiga  Technologies  have announced that there is to be an official CDROM
unit  for  the  A600/A1200  with CD32 emulation.  The drive is said to be
quad speed and to connect to the PCMCIA slot.  Thus leaving the trap door
slot free.

< Sadness and NFA >
Are  to  release  their  first  CDROM  of  AGA  stuff.   Named  'The  AGA
Experience'.

< Wordworth 5 >
Wordworth 5 is due for release any day now and has been speeded up beyond
reality  or  so  its said.  Extra features are REXX support, Fast Format,
Font  Effects,  and  true multitasking.  You can even edit docs while the
program  is  printing!   But  the  best  bit  of news is the upgrade from
previous versions of Wordworth is only £29.99.  For more information call
01 395 270 273

< Silica >
Silica  go  into  receivership but don't panic it is a protective more as
Silcia's parent company is in financial difficulties.  All is expected to
be sorted out soon and all orders are said to be OK and will be honoured.

< Hi-Soft >
Two  new  Squirrels  rolls  into  town  this  one  has  the standard SCSI
interface  and  a  serial port capable of speeds of 300,000bps.  So those
with fast modems can now get the best out of them.  The other Squirrel is
an  MPEG decoder/encoder.  Yup thats right with this unit you can convert
your own anims etc into MPEG file formats etc.

< Team 17 >
After  all  the  rumours  that  Team 17 were to leave the Amiga they have
announced  they will be staying around at least a while longer.  There is
plans  for Alien Breed 3D special edition.  This version will have a full
map editor but best off all it will also have a pixel rate of 1:1 eg full
screen  and  no blockyness.  But this is at a price, you will need an 030
in your A1200 to get the best from it.

< Fields of Vision >
Are to release a Doom style game that has full screen and 1:1 pixel rate.
Its  rumoured that Power computing have made a deal to sell it with their
Turbo Boards.

< Amos Pro >
Amos  Pro  is  to be re-released at a retail price of around £29.99 there
has  been no news of an upgrade to AGA but we hope to have full info next
month.

< World of Amiga Show >
The  World  of  Amiga  Show  is back!  On the 6th and 7th of January at a
London location Ill be there so look out for me ;)

Thats all for this month. Byz.
