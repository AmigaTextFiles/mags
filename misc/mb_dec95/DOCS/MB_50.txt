          How to have virtually 'no flicker' on a 15khz monitor
          -----------------------------------------------------

                               By Defacto

MAGICWB,  is a new set of icons for your Workbench, that spruce it up and
gives it a proffesional appearance, but you have to put the screenmode to
interlace (640x512).  As you all know this causes flicker which even on a
AGA  machine is pretty bad.  The only way to get rid of the flicker is to
buy a flicker-fixer or a Multisync monitor, both expensive.

In  the  summer  I  went  and bought a pair of sunglasses with 'polarised
lenses',  but  I  had  long  forgot  about them and put them away in deep
storage  until  next  summer, then it hit me!  Polarised lenses block out
glare and reflections and the monitor, (Philips CM8833MK2) was flickering
like  mad, so I tried on the glasses and hey presto!, flicker was reduced
to a acceptable degree.

Now  you can either buy a screen glare filter, which is recommended as it
also sheilds you harmful radiation and improves contrast, or buy a decent
pair  of  'shades'  this  will  save  you  a  lot  of  money and give you
acceptable flicker.

If  you  know  of any other tips of reducing flicker WITHOUT buying a new
monitor then send us your suggestions to MiGGYBYTE!.

NOTE:   If your shades are really dark then turn up your contrast on your
monitor/TV  if that doesn't work then buy another pair of shades that are
'lighter' or a anti-glare filter - recommended.

Now is that a total useless tip or what ;)
