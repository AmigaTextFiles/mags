                    An Announcement to PD libraries

                            MiggyByte Editors

Hey  PD people, if you stock our magazine please only charge 2.00 for the
entire  MiggyByte  magazine, this includes costs of copying, distribution
and  materials,  etc, Except for special issue which may be 2-3 disks you
may then charge a extra pound per extra disk.  If any PD library is found
to  be  charging  more  than  the  quoted  price,  they  will be politely
informed,  but  if  no  action  is  taken  we  will unfortunately have to
effectively `Black list` you.  Please this is not intended as a whinge or
threat, but basically when people can download this magazine freely for a
about a pound from BBS`S, you would only be doing yourself a disservice.

If you want to become a registered distribution site for MiggyByte please
contact   us  and  we`ll  be  more  than  happy  to  send  details  about
registering.  This will cost nothing apart from you sending us a S.A.E so
you  can  receive  the  Magazine  1  week  before general release and any
updates!!!.    Unfortunately   this  service  is  only  available  to  PD
libraries!!,  sorry  peoplez!.   Please  also  contact  us if you want to
advertise  your  PD  library for a nominal charge per issue, this offered
only as a first come, first serve basis.

END
