           How the next generation Amigas should look like
           -----------------------------------------------
   
                        By Robert Harvey


When I first saw the A4000T, I started to drool, but I thought about some
interesting designs.

1. Pizza Box case
-----------------

This  would  be  similar to those macs you get, but at the front have the
AMiGA logo plastered over it, maybe a pull down flap were the Disk Drives
reside.

2. Mini Tower case
------------------

A  Mini  tower  case with the Amiga logo on it as well and have a sort of
oval shape to it.

3. Tower Case
-------------

Make  this  look the best of the lot, slightly modify the current case of
the  A4000T, and keep the flap, but as with the tower make it more 'oval'
and ergonomic.

4. Entry level case
-------------------

For  a  A1200  type  machine,  make  it small as a full size keyboard, in
length  and  width, but make as high as 1.5 inches.  Also make a 'battery
supply'  so  it  doesnt  have  to have a external PSU.  Also put a little
rubber trackball thingy like on IBMS thinkpads.


Thats about it, I couldnt thing of anymore!  :).
