Human sex life
 
It  seems  that  when God was making the world, (s)he called man over and
bestowed  upon him 20 years of normal sex life.  Man was horrified!  Only
20  years  of  normal sex life?  But the Lord was adamant -- that was all
man could have.
 
Then the Lord called the monkey and gave him 20 years.  "But I don't need
20  years,"  he  protested, "ten is plenty for me." Man spoke up eagerly,
"Can I have the other ten?" The monkey graciously agreed.

Then  the  Lord called the lion and gave him 20 years; and the lion, like
the  monkey,  wanted only ten.  Again man spoke up, "Can I have the other
ten?" The lion said of course he could.

Then  came  the donkey and he was given 20 years -- but, like the others,
ten was sufficient.  And again man pleaded, "Can I have the other ten?"
 
Which  explains  why  man  has  20 years of normal sex life, ten years of
monkeying  around, ten years of lion about it, and ten years of making an
ass of himself.
