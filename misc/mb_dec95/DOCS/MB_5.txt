                       -------------------------

If you  wish to  contribute some files to  Miggybyte  then  please follow
these simple rules.

1)  All  text files must be in ASCII format, don't bother formatting them
    as this is all done by me.

2)  Music  mods  should  be in a Tracker format or a MED format.  Try and
    keep them around the 70k size.

3)  All pics should be in IFF format and compatible with the OCS (the old
    1.3 Amigas).  We might go AGA by Xmas but for now OCS only.

Also note all work submitted is considered PD/Freeware with the copyright
retained by you, unless you state other wise.

The  best  way  to get your master pieces to us is  to upload them to our
WHQ BBS CHANNEL X 0181 943 5187

or send it via postal mail on a DSDD disk to:

Mr B.Gaunt (MB)
41 Wellington Road
Hampton Hill
Middlesex
TW12 1JY

If  you  submit by postal mail and wish to receive the next issue as soon
as its ready then include 2 first class stamps.

There  are  other  ways  to  submit  material see 'Contacting Miggybyte &
Distribution Sites' but the above two methods will be guaranteed to reach
us.
