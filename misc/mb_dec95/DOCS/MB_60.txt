                              By Sigma Alpha

This is Roxette's latest album it is, as the name suggests their greatest
hits.   It  comes  with a few bonus tracks that were recorded in July and
August  '95.   For fans amongst you the prospect of some brand new tracks
and good ones at that, may I say is enough for you to go out and buy it.

Anyway below are the track listings form the album :-

* Brand new tracks Never made in July / August

1, June afternoon *
2, You don't understand me *
3, The Look
4, Dressed For success ( Uk single mix )

Now isn't it Must have been love the Very best LURVE song of all time?

These  tracks  are  truly Roxette's greatest work, this is a must for all
Roxette  fans  and  anyone  else  that is into Rock or 'PowerPop' as they
describe their work in a documentry aired on MTV last year.

Sigma's Rating 89/100

Any ways news from the cd sleve says that their very first album, 'pearls
of  passion'  currently  never released in the UK is to be re-released in
the spring of 1996.  So Watch out for the review of that in future issues
of your beloved /\/\iGGYBYTE.
