The Top 10 ways things would be different if Microsoft built cars.
 (drumroll, please...)

1.  A particular model year of car wouldn't be available until AFTER that
year, instead of before.

2.   Every time they repainted the lines on the road, you'd have to buy a
new car.

3.   Occasionally  your  car  would just die for no reason, you'd have to
restart it.  For some strange reason, you would just accept this.

4.   You  could  only  have  one person at a time in your car, unless you
bought a car '95 or a car NT, but then you'd have to buy more seats.

5.   You  would be constantly pressured to upgrade your car.  Wait a sec,
it's that way NOW!

6.   Sun  Motorsystems  would make a car that was solar powered, twice as
reliable, 5 times as fast, but only ran on 5% of the roads.

7.   The  oil,  alternator,  gas, engine warning lights would be replaced
with a single "General Car Fault" warning light.

8.   People would get excited about the "new" features in Microsoft cars,
forgetting  completely  that  they had been available in other brands for
years.

9.  We would still be waiting on the "6000 sux 58'" model to come out.

10.  We'd all have to switch to Microsoft Gas (tm).  Bonus:

11.  New seats will force everyone to have the same size butt.

12.   Ford,  General Motors and Chrysler would all be complaining because
Microsoft was putting a radio in all its models.
