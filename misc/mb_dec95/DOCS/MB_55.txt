                        AmigaOS 4: What it should have
                       --------------------------------

                            By MiGGYBYTE READERS

After  the  press  release  on  the PowerAMiGA, a lot of readers wrote in
asking  for  more  information  and  also  sent there suggestions for the
future OS etc.  Here are a few of the common suggestions.
        O Seperate Palette for Backdrops and Icons 

No  longer  would  you have to 'share' the palette with the icons and the
backdrop.
        O Multitasking Workbench Environment

When you perform a workbench function, such as rename you cannot open any
drawers until you finish renaming.
        O Reqtools library licensed, replacing the ASL

This was the most common suggestion, having a more effiecient requestor.
        O Multiview/Datatypes speeded up possibly in ROM

Interesting.....
        O Ability to change gadgets etc like MUI

This  would  be  fun  to have in the OS without 3rd party support add ons
like MUI.
        O TCP/IP/COMMS.. more comms stuff in ROM for easier use

Agreed....
        O A comprehensive help facility for beginners

This  would  be  good,  but  we dont want 15 million help files about the
place.
        O Memory Protection/Networking

This is being done by AmiTech anyway no worries there.
        O Abilties to open screens as windows like other OS'S

That means playing your favorite game on workbench if you want
        O DUAL MULTITASKING.. abitliy to use two uses two mice
          on workbench so you can do your work, whilst your
          friend plays a game, both at the same on the same machine!

WOW!, this would be kewl!, but I dont think this is possible or is it?.
        O All requesters centered or mouse sensitive.

This was the most popular suggestion to date!, 90% of readers said that!.

Well  there  were many more, and we may include them in the next issue if
theres any time left.
