                             By Robert Scott

It  is  about time that pirating is being banged home to us, there are no
two  ways about it pirating is destroying the Amiga.  I do take the point
that  Apoganza  made  about bringing down the price of software to battle
piracy.  This is a very valid point and I am 110 percent sure that if all
the companies too this policy up that it would work.

The  reason  i  say this is beacuse I used to be a pirate, for the reason
that  I could not afford to buy 30 pound games.  Howeverr if I did like a
game  I  would  go  out  at the weekend and buy it.  This brings me to my
other  point.   If  there was a better service at computer shops to allow
yuto  try  a game in full at the shop before perchase then you would find
that  more people would end up buying due to the fact they would know the
quality of the game they are purchasing.

Another  way around this would be to send out more demos of games on disk
magazines or even a service in which your local shop would provide a demo
if  you  took  in  blank disks.  All these are ways in which a pirate i.e
what i was to give up pirating for legal buying of QUALITY games.
