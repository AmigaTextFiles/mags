                       THE RULES OF BEDROOM GOLF


                01. Each player shall furnish his own
                    equipment for play - normally one
                    club and two balls.

                02. Play on a course must be approved
                    by the owner of the hole.

                03. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is
                    to get the club in and keep the
                     balls out of the hole.

                04. For most effective play, the club
                    should have a firm shaft.  Course
                    owners are permitted to check
                    shaft stiffness before play
                    begins.

                05. Course owners reserve the right to
                    to restrict club length to avoid
                    damage to the hole.

                06. The object of the game is to take
                    as many strokes as necessary until
                    the course owner declares that the
                    play is complete.  Failure to do
                    so may result in being denied
                    permission to play the course
                    again.

                07. It is considered bad form to begin
                    playing the hole immediately upon
                    arrival at the course.  The
                    experienced player will normally
                    take time to admire the entire
                    course with special attention to
                    the well-formed bunkers.

                08. Players are cautioned not to
                    mention other courses they have
                    played or are currently playing,
                    to the owner of the course being
                    played.  Upset course owners have
                    been known to damage players
                    equipment for this reason.

                09. Players are encouraged to bring
                    proper rain gear for their own
                    protection.

                10. Players should assure themselves
                    that their match has been properly
                    scheduled, particularly when a new
                    course is being played for the
                    first time.  Previous players have
                    been known to become irate if they
                    discover someone else playing on
                    what they consider to be a private
                    course.

                11. is in shape for play at all times.
                    Some players may be embarrassed if
                    they find the course to be
                    temporarily under repair.  Players
                    are advised to be extremely
                    tactful in this situation.  More
                    advanced players will find
                    alternative means of play when
                    this is the case.

                12. The course owner is responsible
                    for the manicuring and pruning of
                    the bush around the hole to allow
                    for improved viewing of, alignment
                    with and approach to the hole.

                13. Players are advised to obtain the
                    course owners permission before
                    attempting to play the back nine.

                14. Slow play is encouraged.  However,
                    players should be prepared to
                    proceed at a quicker pace, at
                    least temporarily, at the course
                    owners request.

                15. It is considered outstanding
                    performance, time permitting, to
                    play the hole several times in one
                    match.
