                              By Robert Scott

I  read last issue about the teletext service that channel 4 are running,
I  have been monitoring this particular segment for a while now.  I can't
believe  the  amount of  propaganda  released  about  all  other computer
formats.  And  the  way in which the Amiga is put down there must be some
payments or insensitives being made to senior management.

How on earth can anyone put the Amiga down when it is used in such a wide
variety  of  uses.   Just imagine without the Amiga, quality of Films and
television  programs  like Babylon 5 and Star Trek and the many other not
as well known stuff would not be up to the standard that they are today.

Teletext  seem to mock the fact that the Amiga enhanced such programs but
they  can  do  this as much as they want because the fact is right before
them  it  is  used  and  WILL continue to be used as the leading graphics
machine it is.

Just  because  the Amiga maybe slower than some machines it still manages
to  provide  a service second to none.  I'm sure in the future this small
drawback  will be resolved by the RISC technology promised to us my Amiga
Technologies.

I  would  like  to say thank you to your magazine for bringing such up to
the minute news, the last two issue i have thoroughly enjoyed and noticed
that  you have got the important issues to us before any of the computing
press.
