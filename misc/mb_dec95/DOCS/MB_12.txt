                Press Release on Excelsior! Pro BBS software
                -------------------------------------------
      
                    IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOLLOWS!!!
  
AmiCom!   (Amiga  Communications!) has purchased Excelsior!  Professional
BBS software from Sycom.
 
This  purchase  relinquishes all connections of Excelsior!  development
and support from Tom Dietz.
 
Amicom!   is  from this day forward the Sole company connected with the
advancement, sales, and support of Excelsior!  Professional BBS software.
 
AmiCom!   has  a Dedicated team of Programmers and Supporters to assist
Sysops  with  problems  and move Excelsior!  BBS Further into the Furture
with new features and fresh Ideas.
 
At this time, We have the Following plans for Excelsior!

      Excelsior! 2.0 :
 
       - Examine and decipher the 2.0 Code.  
       - Put out Beta's to our Beta Team.
       - Fix any Remaining Bugs.
       - Print out Manuals.
          (These will be all new manuals. Completly re-writen in a
          new package design.)
       - RELEASE!!! (Current target date is December)
       - A demo version of 2.0 will be available.
 
      Excelsior! 1.x :
      
       There will be a 1.21k release. This will consist mainly of bug
       fixes. It will be a free update to all registered sysop's.
             
       After that release all NEW development will be focused on 2.0.
       We will however continue to support 1.21 in bug fixes only.    
 
We  are  hopeing  to do this as soon as physicaly possible.  We must look
through  what  Tom  has  done,  and  find  the  few remaining bugs he had
noticed.  At this time, We will put out a Beta for testing.
 
Unlike Tom Dietz, We are NOT releasing 2.0 as a PUBLIC Beta!  We see this
as  More  of  a  Problem than it is worth.  A Public Beta would only make
some  sysops  Mad  when  they  come  across  Major  bugs, and we would be
Overflowed  by  Netmails  concerning  more problems.  So as a Result, our
decision  is  to have a Select group as a "Beta-Team".  These people will
be  choosen  by  us, and will be the Key group in the Final release.  The
Faster  they  can pinpoint the problems, The faster we can get Excelsior!
2.0 out to you.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-Orders:
 
At  this time, We are accepting Pre-Orders.  Those who Pre-Order now will
receive  their  Excelsior!  2.0 package when the Beta tests are compleat,
BEFORE it is released to the general public.
 
We  are hoping for Final release by December.  if all goes right with our
efforts, We will be releasing it publicly at that time.
