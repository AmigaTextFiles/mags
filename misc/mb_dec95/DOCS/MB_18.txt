                        Review by Tim Stokes

Pinball  Dreams,  Pinball  Illusions  and Pinball Fantasies were the best
pinball  games  of  their time on any machine.  But sadly this game fails
dismally  because of one basic fact.  The ball in the game doesn't act at
all  like it should in real life.  Its a shame as the tables on this game
aren't  bad  and  the  graphics  and  sound  effects  are  very  good.  I
especially   like   the   way  the  buffers  let  out  small  flashes  of
plasma/lightening when a ball strikes them.

All said and done the tables aren't too bad and the multi ball feature is
rather  kewl  but due to the total lack of control the game is unplayable
and  a complete waste of money.  There is no skill in the game due to the
total  lack  of  ball/flipper control.  So all your games tend to rely on
luck.

A  very  sad  game  that is only up to PC standards not wort while on the
Amiga as we have better!  PC users will love it tho ;)

If  you  want  a  Pinball game get one of the many others as there all in
budget release and much more playable.
