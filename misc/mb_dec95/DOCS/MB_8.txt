                           POWER PC BOARDS
                           ---------------

Phase  5 will bring out Power PC Boards (603e and 604, maybe 620 too) for
A1200,  A3000  and  A4000 in June/July (evaluation Boards for developpers
are available in January).

They  will  use  68k  Emulation  and  will have ported Exec, Graphics and
CyberGFX till June/July to Power PC Native Code.
The rest will be ported one after the other, later...

CyberGFX  3  will support "multimedia and 3D functions, audio and video".
It  weill support AGA in addition to GFX Boards.  They work together with
Amiga Technologies and they say, future Power PC products from both firms
will be compatible (they work in cooperation with Amiga technology).

The  low  end  boards seem to be quite cheap (1000 german marks, which is
about 1.3x the price of a new A1200 without software-package).
Some  developpers already announced support (proDAD, Softwood, Almathera,
MAXON).  

Amiga  Technologies  Power Amiga?  Will it use CyberGFX 3 then, to remain
compatible?  (I hope so...) But sounds to be GOOD news...  :) These Power
PC  604  are  speed  monsters  ...  :) They had already some sort of Beta
version  of  the  Developper  Board there to look at it...  but only dumb
hardware up to now...  --
