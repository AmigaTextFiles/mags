  Welcome to another issue of WhatIFF?, as we unbelievably near the end of 
  2022 the Amiga scene has gone from strength to strength with new 
  hardware and software being released. While there is much to be worried
  about in the world it warms my heart to see how how Amiga users get
  together to help each other and work towards the common Amiga good. So
  saying I wish all our American and Canadian readers a happy Thanksgiving
  while unfortunately we do not celebrate it in Japan I hope that you all
  will have a wonderful time with your families and enjoy mountains of 
  turkey and stuffing. It is times like that this remind me of how global
  WhatIFF? is with writers from Canada, America, United Kingdom, Australia 
  and Japan few magazines can boast of such an international writing staff. 
  I want to deeply thank all of the magazine's contributors for their hard 
  work and support of the magazine. 
  
  That smoothly brings me onto this issue, while we have lost a writer 
  another has returned @{"Steve Lord" link stevelord} reviews the Classic
  Amiga Programming book, and the ever reliable @{"John Scolieri" link johnscolieri}
  has written a guide on installing Amiga OS3.2 on an Amiga OS4.1
  machine and a review of the Elbox Fast ATA card. @{"Ivan Sorensen" link ivansorensen}
  has a fantastic article on newcomers to the A1200 and can be found in
  the Articles section.
  
  And that is not all but I do not want to ruin the fun in exploring the 
  magazine. Finally thank you to all our readers who have downloaded the 
  magazine from WhatIFF? website and aminet. Your comments have been very 
  helpful in improving the magazine.
  
  Before I sign off, I just want to mention that the next issue will be
  out in December and it will be our first full year, if there is anything 
  that you would like us to cover, interview or create a guide for then get 
  in contact and we will see if we can accomodate your requests. Have a 
  wonderful October/November, remember to watch something scary for 
  Halloween (Alien never fails!) and see you in December!

  ##To Scanline Or To Not Scanline, That Is The Question!

  There are many things that get retro computer user and gamers aggitated 
  and ready to argue about but one of them that seems to really raise the
  hackles of the our particular group are ... scanlines! I generally
  try to stay out of these arguments since it can quickly turn into a
  long and winded shouting argument with neither side agreeing.

  However this is Shell Talk so I do not have to worry about anyone
  throwing stones at me and also we have a lack of writers this issue so I 
  will have to take up the mantle again.

  So, scanlines ... I love them.

  Why do I love them? Well as most people my age and probably those reading
  this, remember the warm glow of our CRT TVs and monitors. The horizontal
  lines have been burnt into our collective memories. But for me it also 
  reminds me of the arcades, I remember seeing Street Fighter, Metal Slug 
  and even the 3D games such as Daytona USA on huge CRT monitors. Those 
  scanlines represented the excitement of going to the arcade with its 
  chunky pixels and thousands of colors that my lowly Amiga or SNES could 
  not even dream of reproducing.  

  Fast forward a few years and ...

  When I started to get back into retro gaming I'd bought an LCD TV. 
  Plugging in my Megadrive with the phono cables I was excited to relive 
  my youth again, instead all I received was a hard jolt of modern 
  reality. My memories of crisp and colorful images was replaced with a 
  blurry and faded mess. 

  This was not the Megadrive of my youth!  

  Shocked by the terrible image before my eyes I quickly turned off the
  MD and TV and started to think of how I could improve the picture. As
  is common now, the Internet came to my rescue as I searched about
  hooking a MD up to a modern TV. It was at this time that I was introduced 
  to the Framemeister and the infamous scanlines. My curiousity was fully
  peaked at this time and I went shopping for one of these mythical 
  devices. 

  The first time I saw the price I was knocked off my chair but the more I 
  looked at the mess on my TV the more I started to sway and eventually
  I decided to descend into the rabbit hole that is the, Framemeister!

  Suffice to say once I received the device and had it setup and hooked to
  my Megadrive I was immediately convinced this was one of the best 
  purchases I had made. I was so impressed that I ended up buying the
  special cables for my Super Famicom and PC Engine, it also reminded me
  to have a look at the scanline settings for my IndivisionAGA.

  Since then I have not looked back and pretty much with all my computing I 
  use scanlines, when I game or doing pixel work, even as I write this in 
  ProText I use the scanlines from the Indivision.

  Aside from the warm nostalgia I get, I also genuinely believe that the
  graphics from the 240p consoles; NES, Master System, Neo Geo, SNES,
  Megadrive, PC Engine and Amigas look several shades better. There is the
  belief that the graphics look better because the artists were using the
  scanlines as an extra effect to their advantage, and there is most 
  likely truth in the statement but also our nostalgia is a 
  strong contender. 

  Finally, and I think this cannot be denied, when you place scanlines over 
  low resolution graphics it does have a tendancy to make them look as if
  there is more detail.

  ##What Next?
 
  So if you have only experienced the scanlines from the likes of the mini
  consoles such as the A500 Mini or SNES Mini, grab a real Megadrive or 
  SNES, get yourself a scandoubler such as the Framemeister or OSSC and
  give those scanlines a try, I think you might be surprised how difficult
  it is to go back to a life without scanlines.

      @{b}Elbox Fast ATA 4000 MK-VII review Part 1@{ub} - by @{"John Scolieri" link johnscolieri}
============================================================================

  ##Product Name
  Elbox Fast ATA 4000 MK-VII

  ##Available From
  shop.elbox.com

  ##Price
  Euros 166.95 (Inc. VAT)

  ##Hardware/Software Requirements
  A3000/A4000

  ##Review

  I used to love running my old Cheetah scsi hard drive in my Amiga 4000 at
  18,000 rpm screaming along happily off of my Blizzard Cyberstorm MKIII
  onboard UW-scsi bus for many years but then I got married and had kids
  and that loud screaming scsi drive which I adored had to go for my wifes
  and small kids sanity while living  in a small one bedroom apartment. 
  Since then I've  been using my Amiga 4000's onboard IDE with various IDE 
  drives until the CF cards, then DOMS and SSD drives came along. Nice and 
  silent they were but sadly no comparison speed wise compared to my old 
  UW-SCSI setup. I had tried the SCSI-SD solution few years back 
  but that was slower than my onboard IDE and it started giving me
  read-write errors after a year of so of copying tons of small files so 
  back to the onbard IDE I went. 
  (just want to qualify I believe that was v4 early version of the card
  and I assume the speed and reliability is better nowadays?)

  Fast forward to last year and I found an old Fasta ATA 1200 by ELBOX in 
  a bin of parts that I think I got from a World of Commodore show about a 
  decade ago and totally forgot about it and that got me thinking about my
  Amiga 4000 again so off I went to ELBOX's webpage (elbox.com) to happily
  see they are still making new Fast ATA cards and purchased a sharp 
  looking black Fast ATA 4000 MK-VII Zorro III card.
  
  ###Card features:

  * Fast transfer rate of up to 16.6MB/s
  * Supports PIO-0, PIO-3, PIO-4 and PIO-5 modes
  * Compatible with ATA 33/66/100/133 devices
  * Adds two buffered and terminated ports for 4 devices
  * LBA 48 support in the onboard BootROM (support of drives over 128GB)
  * Automatically configured devices
  * Compatibility with OS4.1
  * Boots from any attached HDD, ZIP or LS-120
  * support for: HDD drives, Compact Flash cards, CD-ROM drives, CD-R 
    drives, CD-RW drives, ZIP drives, LS-120 drives. 

  Once received the installation of both hardware and software was straight 
  forward and involved installing the included software via floppy and then
  inserting the  Fasta ATA 4000 MK-VII into an open Zorro slot in my
  Amiga 4000 and re-booting. Great stuff and easy and can't wait to start 
  doing SysSpeed tests and ... hmm that's strange the card wasn't found at 
  bootup. Ok no problem I've seen this before let me try another Zorro slot 
  but same issue. Oh oh that's the only two empty Zorro slots I have as I 
  already have my VA2000 RTG card by MNT Research and my X-Surf-100 by
  Individual Computers. Next step was to try the FastATA at the other
  two remaining slots and move around my VA2000 and X-Surf-100 cards
  but sadly still nothing! Time to ask Elbox support for help and they 
  confirmed that they have no reported issues with either the VA2000 and 
  X-Surf-100 giving any issues with the Fasta ATA4000 MK-VII and they 
  recommended I remove all the Zorro cards and only keep the FastATA...ok 
  thinking to myself that this is no help to me if it works anyhow without 
  my other much needed Zorro cards? My gut feeling aside I removed all 
  Zorro cards except the FastATA and sadly still nothing!

  Elbox then told me to see if the card was at least seen in the early 
  startup menu...you know the 2 button mouse hold down right before 
  pressing the power button. Again nothing at all. Next Elbox asked to 
  send them over hi definition pictures of the card to cheque for any 
  defects though I couldn't see any myself. After a week or so Elbox said 
  they couldn't see any issue and to remove the socketed chips and re-seat 
  them and also to clean the connector pads again. Did that and still 
  nothing so Elbox asked that the card be sent back to their shop for 
  further investigation.

  It took a very long time and was very expensive to ship the card back to 
  Elbox in Poland last year during the pandemic..customs, postal workers 
  shortage, slow downs due to Covid etc. etc. Very long story short Elbox 
  didn't find anything wrong with the card.

  They said it could be a voltage issue, old caps etc. BUT all of my 
  voltages are spot on and confirmed by my trusty multi-meter, all my 
  capacitors were changed two years ago on my motherboard, Zorro board 
  and PSU and my system has been running rock solid for years to boot. I 
  even ran every diagnostic tool I could and all was good...yes even timing 
  issues (there's always that amigan that brings up timing fixes eh lol) 
  Elbox told me they would refund my money but I told them I had already 
  spent a pretty penny mailing the card back to them and asked if they 
  could keep the original card and to please mail me back a new one 
  (I'm a bit superstitious like that). Luckily they agreed and I 
  recently finally got back my new FastaATA 4000 MK-VII card a month ago 
  but no surprise, it had the same issues..sigh. I reached out to the Amiga
  community as I've always done over the years (even before the internet 
  existed) and there was one other Amiga 4000 owner with similar setup like 
  mine that had no problems with the FastATA go figure while other users 
  said they had some issues when updated to the new AmigaOS3.2 roms but all 
  of them were able to at least see the FastATA in their early-bootup menu 
  so that makes me scratch my head even more!?

  Well I'm not one to quit that easily eh and that's why this is part one. 
  I figure I'll try my FastATA card out again when there's another physical 
  rom released as there's rumours of a new OS3.3 or whatever the number 
  jump the developer deem fits.

  If any of you fellow WhatIFF? readers have any advice for me to try out 
  I'd be very happy to hear from you so, don't be shy.

	    @{b}AmigaKit A1200 8MB Card Review@{ub} - by @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

  ##Product Name
  A1200 8MB FAST RAM MEMORY EXPANSION (40MHZ FPU OPTION)

  ##Available From
  AmigaKit: amigakit.amiga.store

  ##Price
  £56.99 (Inc. 20% VAT)

  ##Hardware/Software Requirements
  A1200
 
  ##We All Need Some Memory
  
  While it is nice to have a supped up Amiga with an 060 CPU or even one 
  of the Power PC cards, at times we just need a little memory.  Coming 
  in at a wallet friendly £56.99 the 8MB Fast Ram card from AmigaKit 
  provides more than simple memory expansion.

  On the card it has a slot for an optional FPU and underneath two clock 
  ports, so you can add a real-time clock battery or perhaps something 
  else.

  AmigaKit has been around for a while and generally has a good reputation 
  there have been some customers who have not received their products but 
  I have not had any trouble ordering from them. In addition being in Japan 
  means that I am exempt from the 20% which reduces the price a bit. 
 
  Processing time was fast and the card was shipped within a week, shipping 
  time took around 2 weeks and was sent via Registered Royal Mail.  Upon 
  receiving the card, everything was packed well as is per usual with 
  AmigaKit and came with a single page instruction manual.  

  The first thing that strikes you is how dinky, if I can use that word, 
  the card is.  Previous memory expansion cards took up the entire 
  expansion slot, this card is just over half the size.  This meant it was 
  considerably easier to install compared to previous cards and best we 
  not mention the installation of an TF1260 card.

  The card itself has a slot for an FPU up to 40mhz, and two clock ports,
  in way these ports a little redundant if all you want is a real-time 
  clock since the A1200 motherboard already has a free port.  However 
  there are a number of other expansions available from the clock port 
  such as additional network adapters or even adding a USB port.  If the 
  card can handle these expansions is another question though.  As with 
  all memory cards the card will disable the PCMCIA port when the full 
  8MB of memory is used, however there is a jumper to give limiting the
  card to 4MB of ram allowing the PCMCIA slot to be accessed.  Currently 
  the card is at version 1.5 and was originally released in March of 2020.

  ##In Use

  Aside from having to change the jumper (which thankfully is on the 
  bottom of the card) when I wanted to access the PCMCIA slot the card 
  worked flawlessly.  I encountered no stability issues, and as always the 
  extra fast ram gave my A1200 a nice little boost.  While you will not be 
  playing Doom anytime soon with this card, it does make the bootup and 
  Workbench use much easier and faster.  In fact if you have a basic A1200 
  with no expansion this card is ideal, it gives your Amiga the much needed
  d fast ram but also for the price of a modern video game.  Having an FPU 
  on card which does not have a faster CPU seems a bit out of place, if
  you are going to use an FPU then most likely you will be doing 3D 
  rendering or playing 3D games and if so then you will most likely be 
  using a faster CPU.  The old 020 is just not up to any serious 3D work, 
  perhaps in the future AmigaKit can remove the FPU and reduce the cost of 
  the card even more, even if they knocked £10-15 off the price for a card 
  without an FPU socket it would make it an even better deal.

  ##Final Thoughts

  While more and more people are pimping their Amiga's with increasingly 
  powerful accelerator cards, there is still a market for this simple exp
  ansion card.  Some people want to experience the Amiga as it was back 
  in 1992 and most of us could only afford a simple memory expansion card 
  back then.  If you take your Amiga out and about, having a simple 
  expansion card that is not easy to be broken or break that bank if it 
  does break, is a great option and this card fills in that need.  For 
  myself this card is great as a backup, if my TF1260 is out of action I 
  want to be able to access my Workbench and having the memory card 
  expansion as back up is a great help when things start to go pear shaped.

  A great little card at a great little price with quality service from 
  AmigaKit. 

  ##Pros and Cons

  + Cheap and small
  + Has ability to choose from 4 or 8MB
  + Additional Clock Ports
  - FPU not really necessary on this type of product

  @{b} Classic Amiga OS Programming: An Introduction Review@{ub} - by: @{"Steve Lord" link stevelord}
============================================================================

  ## Product Name
  Classic AmigaOS Programming: An Introduction - E. Th. van den Oosterkamp

  ## Available From
  Amazon. I paid £15.90.

  ## Special Hardware and Software Requirements
  Something capable of running AmigaOS, a C compiler or an Assembler.

  ## Machine Used For Testing
  Commodore CDTV, 8Mb Slow, 1mb Chip, KS/WB 1.3, Lattice C, CED v3.5
  Amiga 4000, 2Mb Chip, 640Mb Fast, KS/WB 3.2.1, SAS/C, AsmTwo, TextEdit

  ## Review

  Classic Amiga Programming An Introduction (from now on referred to as 
  CAPAI) by E. Th. van den Oosterkamp is a modern book on Amiga OS 
  development. It aims to cover all classic OS versions in one book, not 
  exactly a trivial task.

  ## First Impressions

  The book is split into distinct sections starting with a suggested build
  environment overview, a nice 68000 assembly primer, a whistle-stop tour 
  of the suggested build environment. this is followed by the book's meat: 
  a reference manual covering various aspects of AmigaOS. This is followed 
  by Appendices covering various topics. The choice of topics appears 
  somewhat incomplete and random. Covering every version of every amigaOS 
  function or device would be too much to expect for a reasonable-sized 
  book.

  ## Amiga Setup

  I used two Amigas for this review. Most of the testing was done on a 
  CDTV using CED and lattice C. I also played around with ASM-Two and 
  SAS/C on an Amiga 4000 running Workbench 3.2.1. This gave me a range of 
  Operating System versions and configurations to try.

  I only used these combinations as my compilers and assemblers were 
  already set up. I don't like running VBCC natively and haven't used 
  ASM-Pro. This choice didn't materially affect the review as I was able to 
  follow the material just as well with more familiar (to me) tools.

  ## The Book

  CAPAI covers AmigaOS features including Exec, Intuition, GadTools, ASL,
  Graphics functions, Dos.library, and for some reason trackdisk.device 
  and Diskfont.library. The choices are odd in some places, and coverage is 
  uneven. For example, It's strange to see 7 pages of ASL function coverage 
  without a single example showing how to apply these functions. The 
  existence of requesters is barely acknowledged beyond man page entries 
  for displaybeep(), displayalert(), autorequest(), and easyRequestArgs(). 
  Coverage of intuition is mostly limited to man-page style references, 
  but the gadtools chapter excellently combines summaries and pulls it all 
  together with examples.

  The book refers to itself as an introduction. An early section states:

  "Since the book is written as an introduction it will not cover every 
  single flag or option for the functions that are covered. It will, 
  however, provide a solid base from where you can start writing your own 
  software for the Commodore Amiga"

  CAPAI is no more an introduction than I am a giraffe. I suspect the 
  book's initial plan was to be an introductory guide for people learning 
  or returning to Amiga. The result is clearly more of a reference than an 
  introduction.

  And this is where things fall short. The book mostly summarizes the what 
  while pretending the how and why don't exist. I've never read a 
  programming book with so little code inside. Less experienced readers 
  will need to look elsewhere to understand what they're reading. More 
  experienced readers will find the function descriptions mostly too light 
  on detail to be useful.

  Perhaps the biggest issue with the book is that the bulk - constituting 
  an incomplete set of man-page style content - doesn't add much beyond 
  what's already in NDKs and C manuals.				

  As scathing as this all seems, once you get past the above, the book does 
  some things extremely well. So well, it's worth looking past it's faults 
  for it.

  Where this book excels is in collating already available information in 
  one place. Most people can't afford a complete set of Amiga manuals, but
  can download them. As a dead-tree accompaniment to more serious and 
  weighty virtual tomes CAPAI is genuinely a great reference. CAPAI pairs 
  exceptionally well with the Amiga C Encyclopaedia/Manual from Aminet.

  CAPAI isn't a bad book. It's just not the book it claims to be. For a 
  self-published book the effort really shines through in places.

  The compatibility references, 68000 primer, and bootblock appendix are
  outstanding. The Gadtools chapter was particularly well-written. The 
  chapter on trackdisk.device was a solid overview, although I would've 
  preferred something on using devices in general.

  At £15.90 I found it a little overpriced. Whomever bought it for £5 in
  February 2022 got a bargain. While there are better Amiga programming 
  books on almost every topic this one covers, good luck finding them at 
  those prices.

  Initial impressions of the author's second book: Bare Metal Amiga 
  Programming are much better. The author clearly refined their approach 
  and boy does it show. I wouldn't expect to see a 2nd edition of CAPAI 
  more in the style of Bare Metal Amiga Programming. But if one ever came 
  into existence I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

  ## Likes

  * It's an AmigaOS programming book available to buy in 2022!
  * It's a good dead-tree accompaniment to better digital materials.
  * Some of the more discussion-oriented sections are very very good.

  ## Dislikes

  * It says it's an introduction, but it isn't. New programmers need not 
    apply.
  * Summarizes the what but rarely explains the how or why.
  * The book is sorely lacking in examples. I've never seen a programming 
    book with so little code.
  * A modern book without mention of modern tools and techniques like
    cross-dev environments reads as though it's already dated.

  ## Bugs

  There are minor editing issues here and there but this is to be expected
  for a self-published book of this size. Nothing immediately stood out 
  from what I've followed and tried to implement.

  ## Conclusion

  If you only want one book on AmigaOS programming, download the Amiga C
  Encyclopaedia from Aminet. If you only get two books on AmigaOS 
  programming, make it the Amiga C Encyclopaedia and CAPAI.

  ## Pros and Cons
  + Handy dead tree reference still commonly available in 2022.
  + Some absolute gold makes it a great accompaniment to other material.
  - Much of the content duplicates compiler and NDK documentation.
  - Frustrating lack of examples and explanations of the why and how.

============================================================================

  ##Product Name
  AmyTree v2.2b

  ##Available From
  Aminet

  ##Price
  FREE

  ##Hardware/Software Requirments
  AmigaOS 3.0+

  ##Introducing ... AmyTree

  During my weekly search through the latest uploads to Aminet I came 
  across this intriguing little application.  The description lists it
  as a file system browser presenting the file system as a tree of 
  directories.  I found this an interesting prospect as I often have
  issues finding various audio samples that I created and cannot seem
  to find them again on my internal CF.  Back in the 90s this was not
  such an issue since my hard disk size was around 200mb, now I have an
  8GB CF and as such I have been sampling like crazy, but since I am not
  that much of an organised person a lot of the samples have gotten lost
  on the CF in some far off drawer that I have forgotten about.

  Having the chance to view the file structure from a more visual aspect
  appealed to me greatly. 

  Downloading the application from Aminet and unpacking it was a very
  simple and quick process.  There was no need to install anything
  and I was able to run the programme straight from the drawer.  After
  double clicking on the icon a window pops up with several buttons
  a large empty area on the left and the right side which is mostly
  greyed out.  From the get go you are only able to use four buttons:
  New Tree, Dim Dir, Clone and ListFile.

  ##In Use

  The easiest way to see a directory structure is to drag an drawer or
  drive over to the blank window on the left.  This will quickly display
  the first level of the directory, drawers that have a + next to them can 
  be opened to display the next level.  If you reach the end of the file
  structure the box will become greyed out, however you can see what files
  reside in the drawer by clicking on ListFile, a list on the right side 
  will display all files.  From here you can see the Info of each file, 
  view DataType, Show (display) and Play the file.  There are spaces for
  other actions that can be applied to the files, they can be added by
  using the menu to go to Prefs -> Settings -> Config Button.

  Displaying of directories is very fast and as such has become my goto 
  tool for searching directories, instead of Workbench or DOPUS.  It 
  reminds me of the way you can view files in Mac OS X,  I often use the 
  file tree format to get to a file that is packed far away on the hard 
  disk.  However the programme is not only limited to your hard disk and
  can be used to access CD-ROMs, infact within the readme file the author
  states the programme is most useful in this situation.  When using 
  other programmes such as DOPUS you can get lost if there is a maze of
  directories to get to a particular file, AmiTree allows you to see the
  layout of the directories reducing your chances of getting turned 
  around and lost.

  AmyTree 2022 is a suprisingly useful programme that does something very
  simple but does it well and quickly.  It does not offer as many options 
  such as DOPUS or DiskMaster however the way that it displays the 
  directories is its biggest and best selling point.  However there are a
  few things that I would like to see improved.  When reaching a directory
  you are unable to see the file contents unless you click on ListFile,
  this is quite counter intuitive and I found myself often double clicking
  on the drawer icon expecting to see the tree expand to show the files
  contained within.

  ##Final Thoughts

  It often the case of being a hit and miss when trying new software from
  Aminet.  Programmes often require a number of libraries and other
  software to be installed.  So it was with great pleasure to find AmyTree
  loading up without the need for additional installations.  It is 
  Workbench compliant and looks great with an easy to understand 
  interface.  If you find yourself in the situation of increasing 
  directories and not being able to find files again then I suggest having
  a look at AmyTree 2022.

  ##Pros and Cons

  + Easy to install, no other installs
  + Very fast operation
  + Offers something different to the standard DOPUS/DM interface
  - The display of individual files could be easier

@toc reviews
============================================================================
	    	 @{b}Clouds AGA Review@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

  ##Product Name
  CloudsAGA

  ##Available From
  Aminet

  ##Price
  FREE

  ##Hardware/Software Requirements
  A1200/A4000

  Released in 1996 CloudsAGA is not a new programme however it is a very 
  useful tool that has stood the march of time.  Originally I had been
  exposed to CloudsAGA from a cover disk on Amiga User International, not
  being connected to the internet at this time my only network access was
  via BBSs, as such magazines were the best place to get free software.  
  At this time I was working through my last year of high school and one 
  of the courses I was taking was IB Art, for my final year project I was
  doing a series of artwork created on the Amiga.  CloudsAGA came at just
  the right time as otherwise I might have skipped this great piece of 
  software.
  
  ##In Use

  Upon first loading the programme you are presented with a screenmode 
  requester, you can choose any resolution that you have in your Devs
  drawer and choose a maximum of 256 colours available on screen. Once you 
  have chosen your screenmode and colour depth a simple grey screen is 
  displayed with a tool bar on the right.  Right clicking brings up only 
  an About and Quit options.  The rest of the action takes place on the 
  tool bar on the right.

  The tool bar offers the following options -> 

  *Size* this can be changed in increments of: 
  
  25%  = 64x64
  50%  = 128x128
  75%  = 256x256
  100% = 512x512
  200% = 1024x1024 
  400% = 2048x2048

  *Create* quite explanatory, click to start rendering your cloud 
  image.

  *Palette* here you can choose the sky and cloud colours, changing 
  the settings and you can get some very funky looking clouds.

  *Smooth* clicking this will essentially add antialiasing to the 
  cloud scene.  I highly recommend doing this as it makes the clouds look
  more realistic.

  *Save* click to save your scene as an IFF.

  *Screen* change the current screenmode.

  *Material* has several options, Clouds, Fire, Dark, Forrest.

  Setting up your cloud scene is done quickly and simply with a few clicks 
  of the mouse.  However do be aware that even a powerful Amiga will take 
  time to render a cloud scene at 400%.  Even with my TF1260 running at 
  60mhz the render time for a 400% image took over 15 minutes to finish.  
  Add to that another 10 minutes or so for smoothing be prepared to lose a 
  lot of time rendering just clouds.  Luckily the Amiga multitasks very 
  nicely with the programme so I was able to get on with other things while 
  the Amiga chugged away.  

  During rendering I lost around 500kb of Chip Ram leaving me with 1.2mb. 
  This meant that I could at least start some work on another graphic 
  programme such as Brilliance or DPaint.

  If you want to experiment with CloudsAGA then I suggest using 25% or 40% 
  to start with, especially if you have a lower specced Amiga. When you 
  start rendering there does not seem to be a way to stop it, so once you 
  click on Create it is time to sit tight and get comfortable.

  ##Options
     
  Most of the options listed above are pretty simple, Palette and Material 
  are essentially the same thing with Material just being a preset of the
  Palette button.  Palette though gives you much more control over all the
  colours.  The requester has sliders for RGB and it is possible to save 
  and load palettes.

  The rendering of the clouds is random so each time you click on Create
  you will get a different looking cloud scene.  To do this you need to
  close your current cloud image and start a new one.  While it will take
  more time I find that the smoothing creates a much better image.  The
  first time I created a cloud scene I was impressed but after adding the
  smoothing I felt I had something that could be used in some artwork.
  
  ##Final Thoughts

  If you are looking for an easy way to add some realistic clouds to your
  art projects and do not want to use a digital photo then CloudsAGA could
  be just what you are looking for.  It is has a very easy interface and
  creates some startling realistic clouds.  I have found it great for 
  creating a unique sky or even reflection effect.  It does take time
  though to render even on Amigas with fast CPUs if you want to use it 
  at the maximum size so be ready to give your Amiga some aone time while
  it creates the cloud scene.  There is nothing negative that I can think
  of about this programme except that it would have been nice to have an
  option to cancel creating the image mid render.  Other than that it is
  a solid piece of software that is still useful almost 30 years later.
    
  ##Pros and Cons

  + Realistic looking clouds
  + Easy to use
  + Free
  - Can't cancel mid render

            @{b}Running AmigaOS3.2 under AmigaOS4.1@{ub} - by: @{"John Scolieri" link johnscolieri}
=============================================================================

  Many 68k applications that don't hit the Amiga custom chips directly can 
  be run directly under AmigaOS4.1 without the use of emulation via E-UAE; 
  however, for those that want to run a complete AmigaOS3.2 setup with their 
  PPC machines running AmigaOS4.1 kas1e over at amigans.net has set up a 
  great easy to follow tutorial which I'll be summarizing in this article 
  so let's GO!
 
  1  - Buy copy of AmigaOS3.2 from your favourite Amiga dealer

  2  - Create a folder called AmigaOS3.2CD on your OS4.1 system
       and copy contents of the OS3.2 CD into it

  3  - Download E-UAE with SDL over at OS4depot.net

  4  - Unpack E-UAE to whichever drive partition you like

  5  - If you already have a .uaerc config file from another system you
       can copy it to your E-UAE folder on your OS4.1 system else
       you'll have to use a standard setup file

  6  - Open shell. Create hardfile of 100MB min. for the OS3.2 installation
       using the 'make_HDF system 100' command within the E-UAE folder

  7  - Transfer the required rom file i.e kicka1200.rom from the OS3.2 CD
       to the E-UAE roms folder on your OS4 system

  8  - Open your favourite text editor and open the uaerc config file and 
       set to boot from the AmigaOS3.2CD folder you created in Step 2

  9  - You can now boot into OS3.2 via E-UAE to format your system 
       partition i.e our .hdf file.

  10 - Start the OS3.2 setup installation. Don't forget to install the CPU
       libs if your setting up an 030, 040, or 060 system

  11 - Once the install is complete go back into your text editor and edit 
       the .uaerc config file and comment out the line that boots from
       the copied AmigaOS3.2CD folder

  12 - Reboot E-UAE to load up OS3.2 and fine tune your workbench the way 
       you like it!

  Sounds easy, right? Thanks to kas1e's great YouTube video you can
  follow along step by step at: 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq__c-9bg70

  I might be 'slightly' biased but man it's so cool running the latest

  ##Modler Config File

  In the last issue we had a look at the LW-config file, if you remember it
  gave us the ability to change file requestor settings and render settings
  which can come in handy when your device names do not match up the
  default setttings of LightWave. For this installment we will look at the
  MOD-config file (Modler), after reading this you will have a better
  understanding of how to update the settings of LightWaves's Modeler.

  To start off let's have a look at the contents of the file, the file can
  be found in the same location as the LW-config file; Toaster/3D/. Once
  you have found the file it can be opened in any text editor and what you
  will see is the following:

		MDOP 0

		FlatnessLimit 0.500000
		QuadTriMode 1
		TwoSided 0
		CurveDivision 1
		UnitSystem 0
		FontsDirectory Toaster:ToasterFonts
		MotionsDirectory 3D:Motions
		MacrosDirectory Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm
		MacroListsDirectory 
		MacroList ModelerMacroList
		StartupMacro Toaster:ARexx_Examples/lwm/LoadFonts.lwm
		KeyMacroF1 Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm/Center.lwm
		KeyMacroF2 Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm/Center1D.lwm
		KeyMacroF3 Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm/BBox.lwm
		KeyMacroF4 Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm/Text.lwm
		KeyMacroF5 Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm/nextempty.lwm
		KeyMacroF6 
		KeyMacroF7 
		KeyMacroF8 
		KeyMacroF9 
		KeyMacroF10 
		ColorInterface 1
		ScreenModeID 0

  ##Step By Step
  Let's take this line by line and explain what each one means and does.

  * MDOP 0    

    This is the file identifier and should not be edited.

  * Flatness Limit 0.5000000

    Taken from the value you type in in the New Data Options which can
    be found in in Options under the Objects panel. It is the flatness
    percentage that the Modeler will use when determing if a polygon is
    non-planar or otherwise. The values are written by the Modeler each
    time you exit the program.

  * QuadTriMode 1

    Can be the values (0, 1 or 2) and will decide if Triangles (0), 
    Quadrangles (1) or Automatic (2) willbe set when you create a new 
    object. Can also be found in the Options panel.

  * TwoSided 0

    Value of 0 = one-sided polygons and 1 = two sided polygons, same as
    the One Side or Two Sides buttons in the Options panel.

  * CurveDivision 1

    You have the options Coarse (0), Medium (1), or Fine (2), these 
    options will decide how smooth of curve will be calculated when doing 
    functions such as lathing a curve or creating PostScript fonts.

  * UnitSystem 0

    Let's you decide which unit of measurement to use when the Modeler is
    started.  The options are: SI (0), Metric (1), or English (3).

  * FontsDirectory Toaster:ToasterFonts

    The drawer that Modeler will look in when loading PostScript fonts.

  * MotionsDirectory 3D:Motions

    Like above the default location Modeler will look for finding motion
    files for Path Extrude or Path Clone (Multiply)

  * MacrosDirectory Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm

    Default location for finding macros.  Please note the file could also
    be listed as; MacrosDirectory DH2:LWM

  * MacroListsDirectory or MacroListsDirectory DH2:Toaster/3D

    Default location for finding  macrolists used in the <<CONFIGURE LIST>>
    option the Macro pop-up menu.
 
  * MacroList ModelerMacroList or MacroList DH2:Toaster/3D/JGMacros
    The last used Macro list.

  * StartupMacro Toaster:ARexx_Examples/lwm/LoadFonts.lwm

    The the macro that was last selected tobe executed when Modeler was
    started <<CONFIG LIST>>

  * KeyMacroF1 Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm/Center.lwm
    KeyMacroF2 Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm/Center1D.lwm
    KeyMacroF3 Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm/BBox.lwm
    KeyMacroF4 Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm/Text.lwm
    KeyMacroF5 Toaster:arexx_examples/lwm/nextempty.lwm
    KeyMacroF6 
    KeyMacroF7 
    KeyMacroF8 
    KeyMacroF9 
    KeyMacroF10 
    
       or

    KeyMacroF1  DH2:LWM/Text.lwm
    KeyMacroF2  DH2:LWM/Router.lwm 
    KeyMacroF3  DH2:LWM/PointSpread.lwm 
    KeyMacroF4  DH2:LWM/LightSwarm.lwm 
    KeyMacroF5  DH2:LWM/CutFaces.lwm 
    KeyMacroF6  DH2:LWM/NextEmpty.lwm 
    KeyMacroF7  DH2:LWM/NearBG.lwm 
    KeyMacroF8  DH2:LWM/PointCenter.lwm 
    KeyMacroF9  DH2:LWM/Center1D.lwm 
    KeyMacroF10 DH2:LWM/Center.lwm 

    The options above are written into the config file if you have selected
    chosen any keyboard macro shortcuts with the <<CONFIG KEYS>> option in
    the Macro pop-up menu. 

  * ColorInterface 1

    This is option is only used when using the Modeler by itself, you can 
    choose from a four color (0) or eight color interface (1).

  * ScreenModeID 0

    Setting for the ChangeMode program that comes with the standalone 
    version of LightWave and is used to choose with resolution of Modeler
    is set when running by itself.
  
  ##And we are finished!
  
  So there you have it, a quick explanation of the the MOD-config file, I
  hope that you will find it useful for setting you the Modeler to your
  liking and also to help get rid of annoying requesters asking for
  something something volume to be inserted. Good luck with your rendering
  and we will see you in December for our first year anniversary!

============================================================================
 	          @{b}Brilliance 101 Part 6@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

  Welcome back to another Brilliance tutorial, this time we will be
  looking at the animation brush and it's morphing ability but first ... 

  Morphing, that which was once a poster child of the 1990s has now become 
  passe, hardly turning a head when it pops up. This is probably due to
  over use but it can still be a useful effect, and it is incredibly fun to
  use it programmes such as DPaint and Brilliance. For this issue we will
  look at morphing a brush to create a short animation.

  ##First Steps

  Brilliance makes this an incredibly easy process that once you know how
  it becomes a very natural and fun process. To start with we need to make
  two brushes, your start brush and end brush, the one that it will morph
  into. To make it easy let's create a green filled circle on the left
  side of the screen and a red filled square on the right side of the 
  screen.

  Next right mouse click on the scissors icon or the 'Cut Brush' icon, you 
  will see 8 greyed boxes, left click on the 'Cut Brush' icon and again
  holding the right mouse button cut out the green circle, you will notice 
  that the circle will no longer be on the screen. Go back to the 
  'Cut Brush' tool bar and left click on the far left top grey box. You 
  will see a thumbnail of the circle appear. Now do the same for the red
  box, remembering to click and hold the right mouse button. Once you have
  cut out the red box place it on the top far right box in the 'Cut Brush'
  tool box.

  You should have two thumbnails of your brushes, here comes the fun part.
  Go to the icon on the far left that is next to the camera, it is labeled
  'Anim Brush', right mouse click on it to bring up the tool box. Several
  options will be available: CUT, MORPH, ACTUAL FIT. Since we are doing a
  morph, MORPH is the area we are interested in. For the moment you can
  leave FRAMES as is, what we are interested in is the FROM box. Next to
  it are 8 buttons with the numbers 1-8. Click with the left mouse button
  on 1 and then go to your brush storage with the 8 boxes. Left click on
  the far left thumbnail. Wait a short moment and you will see your brush
  start to morph frame by frame into the other brush. Once it has been
  finished you can stamp the brush down and each time it will move to the
  next frame in the morph.

  ##A Simple Animation Morph

  To make a simple animation, go to the camera icon on the far left side,
  this time you can left click as usual to bring up the animation tool
  bar. First we need to add some frames of animation. To do this all you
  need to do is click on SET#, when the new menu comes up enter 30 into 
  the 'Total Frames' box, then click on 'Proceed'. Go back to your brush
  storage and look for the thumbnail that has a grey and white box in the
  bottom left corner. Once you have chosen your anim brush, left click
  once where you want the brush to go. Looking at your animation
  panel click on button that looks like this >|, you will see it move
  onto the next frame, as you click with the anim brush on each proceeding
  frame the brush will morph bit by bit. Once you have stamped down the
  anim brush for all 30 frames, you can play the animation. As you can
  see this is a very easy way to do a complicated animation.

  Have a play around with different shapes and colours to see which morph
  works best, have a go in True Brilliance to get better color control and
  morph between objects. Good luck and have fun!

  ##Reading AG Files Anywhere!

  Over the last few issues I have been asked by a number of readers how to
  read the magazine on a computer that is not an Amiga. While the magazine
  is produced to be read on an Amiga there are a number of options for
  you to read the magazine away from the comfort of your miggy.  In this
  guide we will list options for reading AG files on a Windows, Mac and
  Linux machine.

  The options that at present work and have been tested are:

  	* WinGuide
          www.aminet.net/package/misc/emu/winguide
	* AGWViewer 
          www.stone-oakvalley-studios.com/post.php?id=000420072020191409
        * AmigaGuideViewer
          www.github.com/andregewert/AmigaGuideViewer
        * TAWS - The Amiga Workbench Simulation
          www.taws.ch
	* WineBotter (For Mac, allows Windows software to run)
 	  www.winebottler.kronenberg.org
   
  As you can see above there are a number of options, if you are running
  windows it is as simple as downloading and installing WinGuide or
  AGWViewer. If you are running a Mac then you will need to install
  WineBottler first but once this is done you can run both WinGuide and
  AGWViwer on the Mac desktop like they are native applications. It should
  be noted that if the AG file does not have the extension .guide it will
  not show up in the requester file, just add the .guide extension if it
  is missing and the viewers should load the AG file without issue.

  Another option that is platform agnostic is to use The Amiga Workbench
  Simulator (TAWS) an amazing project allowing you to boot into any version
  of Workbench from 1.0 up to 4.1 Final Edition. From here you can access
  a copy of WhatIFF? downloaded to your drive and read it as if you are on
  and Amiga. The caveat of this though is that you need to be online to
  read the AG files, which might defeat the purpose if you are not online.

  ##Additionally

  During my research for this short guide I came across another new program
  that has been created to read AG files and this one is is running in Java
  as such it should run fine on Windows, Linux and Mac. AmigaGuideViewer
  unfortunately I was unable to get it to run on my Mac, since I need to
  install Java first and ran out of time for this article, hopefully by the
  next issue I will be able to give my opinions on the software.

  ##Which One Is For You?

  Of the three options available the easiest one is most likely TAWS, there
  is minimum of setup and it renders the AmigaGuide file most accurately.
  However it needs to be online to work and in this regards limits its
  usefulness. That brings me to WinGuide and AGWViewer, I do not have a
  Windows computer and as such had to use WineBottler to use both 
  applications. There is minimal difference between them, the interfaces
  are both very simple and easy to use, however I felt that WinGuide did
  a better job of rendering the text and fonts of WhatIFF?. Whichever
  one you choose it is nice to know that we have several options in 2022 
  to read old and new AG files.

============================================================================

  So you have created a masterpiece on your Amiga but now you want to show
  it to the world, what do you do?  While the Amiga may not be recognised
  as a serious graphics tool anymore the IFF format still lives on in 
  modern versions of Photoshop.  First let's look at what options we have
  to bring over your files, 1. Convert your file in ImageFX or 2. Copy
  the file over directly to your PC/Mac and convert it there.  Let's start
  with the latter process since it is the easiest of the two but does come
  some caveats.

  ##Bring a Raw Amiga IFF File into Photoshop

  We will be using Photoshop since it is pretty much the default art 
  package on any modern system. Amiga users are lucky since Photoshop
  by default supports the Amiga IFF file format however to get it to read
  the file takes an extra step. The Amiga as you know already does not
  require a file extension to read a file, it is not necessary to add
  .iff to your images for example. However on the Mac version of 
  Photoshop and I presume here the Windows version if your file does not
  have the .iff extension it will refuse to load the file.  So all you
  really need to do is copy the file over to your CF card, USB or e-mail
  it and once it is on your Mac/PC add the .iff to file and then open it
  from Photoshop, no need for any importing or conversion.

  Now to that caveat that I mentioned, while this will work fine with any
  register based image, i.e. not a picture created in TrueBrilliance,
  DigiPaint or Deluxe Paint HAM image. If your image is a HAM image then
  you will need to convert the image in a programme such as ImagFX prior
  to loading it into Photoshop otherwise you will get some very strange
  results.

  ##Converting Your Image in ImageFX

  Welcome to our second part of our tutorial, if you are here then I
  presume you have a HAM image that you wish to view or edit on a Mac/PC.
  First we need to load up an image convertor and in my opinion the best
  on the Amiga is ImageFX, luckily there are many versions floating 
  around but even more it is still be supported with the latest version
  being 4.5 available from apps.amistore.net. In the future we will
  review the latest vesion but for now I recommend using ImageFX 2.

  Once you have Image FX up and running go to the right side and click
  on Load, navigate to your file and load it. Do not worry if it does
  not look exactly like your image, ImageFX has several modes of preview
  ranging from grayscale to colour with dithering. Now you have your
  image in ImageFX it is a simple case of clicking on the Save button,
  you will be presented with several options, I find that TIFF works
  best for register and HAM images. Change the name of your file and
  then click on Save.  If you want to save time add the .iff extension
  to your file so it can be loaded right away into Photoshop.

  So there you have it, two ways how to bring your images into Photoshop
  be they register or HAM images. 

  Good luck with your Amiga creating!

============================================================================
     @{b}A Crash Course to Your New Amiga 1200@{ub} - by: @{"Ivan Sorensen" link ivansorensen}
============================================================================

  So you have just picked up an Amiga 1200 online. You've checked that the 
  capacitors don't look risky, it turns on, sound is fine, no distortion in 
  the image, great fighting condition!

  Now you have to actually use the thing. Unfortunately, this is where the 
  saying that retro computing is an expensive hobby often comes in. It is 
  not at all unusual for people to spend as much money on the accessories 
  as the computer itself. This can get especially bad when you are online 
  and seeing all the super-Amiga hardware out there and if you are not 
  careful you are thousands of dollars in the hole without that much 
  improvement over a more modest system.
 
  After all, how much Quake 1 are you really going to play before you boot 
  up Turrican 2 instead? 

  I am going to walk through setting up a 1200 in a way that is perhaps a 
  bit more friendly to a mid-range budget. I will try to speak in general 
  terms, since exact pieces of hardware tend to come and go and what is 
  available now may not be for sale in 2 months. 

  You can separate what you need into two groups: Things you absolutely 
  need to use the system and things you want to make it more pleasant to 
  use. 

  ##Required items:

  * Power supply
  
  Your purchase probably came with a power supply, but the old 
  Commodore power supplies did not have a great reputation when they were 
  new and that has not improved over the years. Do yourself a favor and 
  find a modern, aftermarket solution suitable for the Amiga. The one I use 
  was actually intended to be installed in a tower case but it works fine 
  and have served faithfully for a decade though.
  
  * Monitor
  
  You need a way to display your computer or it won't be all that much use. 
  This used to be a much bigger problem and a lot of older guides still 
  refer to the various hoops you had to jump through. While there are a 
  number of devices that can be used, many modern LCD monitors will display 
  the signal just fine and you can find lists of suitable monitors online. 
  I always test whenever we buy a new computer monitor in our house and the 
  last 4 models have all worked just fine. All you need is a simple amiga 
  monitor to VGA connector and a monitor with a VGA input port and you are 
  in business. The image quality can vary and is rarely perfect but in my 
  experience it is often better than external scan doubling devices and I 
  have never had issues with PAL vs NTSC signals unlike using an old 
  television set.

  * Input devices 

  Using a mouse driven interface is better with a mouse and you will need 
  a joystick for any action games. With mice I think you will save a ton of 
  headaches just getting an adapter to use a modern mouse. PS2 mouse 
  adapters have been around for years and USB ones have started appearing. 
  Then you can just use whatever cheap mouse you have lying around or get 
  online for the purpose.  I use the Cocolino which has scroll wheel 
  support and can use PS/2 mice. It can be found at Alinea Computer Shop:
  
  https://www.amiga-shop.net/
 
  Joystick there are tons online, usually labelled as Atari or Commodore 
  joystick. Buying classic joystick can be hit and miss because they are 
  often in poor shape (and were often cheaply made to begin with) so buy a 
  couple or find a seller that makes a nice, new controller for you to 
  enjoy your games. Gamepads with buttons mapped to jump are popular though 
  pads are not always ideal for Amiga gaming.

  * Speakers 

  What good is fantastic tracker music if you can't hear it? The cheapest 
  solution here is a simple adapter to plug in a 3.5mm connector. Then you 
  can simply use a pair of headphones or simple PC speakers as you see fit. 
  You will benefit from the quality of speakers you connect of course, but 
  bear in mind the fidelity of the audio is not always that high to begin 
  with. If you are using headphones make sure you use ones with volume 
  control as the Amiga does not offer it. 

  ##Additional upgrades

  * Disk drive

  If you are planning on using physical floppy disks, you will definitely 
  want an external floppy drive so you can have an additional drive. These 
  are not especially sought after objects so you should be able to pick up 
  an old drive online for fairly reasonable money. The bigger question is 
  whether to replace the internal drive with a floppy emulator like the 
  Gotek.
 
  Many new Amiga releases are put out in ADF format, making this the most 
  practical option. 

  * File transfer

  A floppy emulator will offer easy ways to get things to your amiga, but 
  it still has limitations as it depends on things being available as an 
  ADF. Luckily the Amiga 1200 is born with a PCMCIA slot which was rarely 
  used back in the day but is worth the weight in gold these days. Cheap 
  adapters are available allowing a compact flash card to be read, allowing 
  both easy file transfer from content downloaded on another computer as 
  well as acting as an external or secondary storage device. Compact Flash 
  cards are not cheap but a simple 4 GB card will offer basically infinite 
  file transfer and storage as far as the average Amiga is concerned.

  * Hard drive

  The humble Compact Flash card returns to the Amiga when it comes to hard 
  drives. This option has been around for some time and you can even find 
  packages with a prepared card ready to use. A simple 4 GB card will work 
  with any Amiga (though newer operating systems can exceed this amount 
  without having to fiddle with partitions) and of course dramatically 
  increases the usability of the system. If you don't mind opening up your 
  system, you can even have multiple cards configured in different ways and 
  swap them out on the fly. 

  * Accelerator

  The last piece of kit to consider is the accelerator card. This fits in 
  the trapdoor and usually contains a mixture of a processor and RAM. While 
  the allure of the mighty 68060 and PPC cards is strong, you can get a 
  great card for much less than the prices those cards command now. 
  Determining what your objectives are will help you make a decision here 
  but as cards tend to keep their value, you can get a cheaper card and 
  replace it down the road.  You can`t go wrong with the ACA cards from 
  Individual Computers.
  
  The minimum port of call is additional RAM: Much classic Amiga software 
  only benefits minimally from added processing speed but almost all 
  applications benefit from extra RAM (and a games machine will need it to 
  take full advantage of WHDLoad of course). A decent 68030 card can be had 
  for reasonable money and will give a noticeable oomph to many programs 
  that are of interest to modern users as well as the various 'Doom clone' 
  games such as Alien Breed 3D. Past the 030 I feel like the costs start to 
  far outstrip the actual benefits you will see from the card, unless your 
  use case is something that specifically needs it. 
  
  ##In conclusion

  I hope this gives you a good checklist to go down when evaluating your 
  'new' Amiga 1200. Many of the options listed above have a minimal cost 
  and will allow you to really get an enjoyable and fun system put 
  together. 
  
  Many are applicable to systems other than the 1200 of course, but since 
  they are very popular machines I felt I would start there.

  ##Magazine Roundup

  We live in exciting times regarding the Amiga, we have come through the 
  ashes of Commodore's demise, the dark days of the early to mid-2000s, and 
  trepidly entered the 2010s with a new envigored attitude and a multitude 
  of new hardware and software being released. Now in the 2020s, the Amiga 
  has become part of the growing retro scene, bringing old and new users 
  back into the fray. It is a very exhilirating time, in addition to new 
  users and hardware we now have several print Amiga magazines to choose 
  from.  

  Ideally, we would be able to subscribe/buy each issue of each magazine 
  however the financial reality for many of us is not that rosy. So to 
  help the reader of our lowly magazine choose which magazine is suitable 
  for you, we will do a roundup of all the current print Amiga magazines.

  The article will not cover any of the free magazines since this is more 
  of a buying guide to help you better spend your hard-earned cash. 
  Currently, there are three print magazines, in order of the oldest to 
  the newest: 

  * Komoda & Amiga Plus
  * Amiga Future
  * Amiga Addict 

  Komoda & Amiga Plus has been around since the early 1990s, 
  Amiga Future since 1998, and Amiga Addict the youngest kid on the block 
  starting in 2021. Let's take a look at each magazine and see how they 
  differ and are similar.

  ##Komoda & Amiga Plus - $30.00/year for 4 issues

  A magazine that is available in digital and physical formats is released 
  4 times a year and available in Polish and English. The print version 
  features a glossy cover and nice thick pages, it feels strong and well 
  put together. It covers not only Amiga but all Commodore machines. 
 
  The magazine predominantly writes about games with a few non-gaming 
  articles popping up. The Commodore section has much more content and 
  focuses on the gaming side, the usual interviews, opinion pieces, and 
  guides do pop up occasionally. The quality of the English writing is 
  very good, it is concise and easy to understand, the articles are 
  entertaining and you can feel the passion the writers have for what 
  they are writing about. The magazine covers are always entertaining 
  with some unique artwork.

  If you are looking for a print or digital magazine that heavily features 
  Commodore games and covers the Amiga then this is the magazine for you. 
  Featuring old and new games for the Commodore computers, articles about 
  the Amiga and new hardware each issue is packed full of information. It 
  is also the largest print Amiga magazine with the current issue at 82 
  pages.

  ##Amiga Future - 55 euros/year for 6 issues or 72 euros/year with CD

  Probably the best known current Amiga print magazine, available in German 
  and English and has been available for over 20 years, has a writing staff 
  of 50 and a subscriber circulation of 800. Each issue comes in at around 
  54 pages and is published every two months, it covers a variety of 
  Amigas: classic, OS4 and up to Morph OS. The content is always varied 
  with a mix of game, hardware and software reviews. The articles are 
  quite in-depth and technical, with some very interesting pieces on how to 
  use and build hardware for your Amiga. The covers are usually quite 
  pleasing with a very professional look and feel, the pages have become a 
  thicker over the last few issues lending to a heavier and nicer feel to
  the magazine. 

  Amiga Future has been a stable presence in the Amiga scene providing the 
  only printed source of Amiga information for a long time. As such they 
  have created a solid platform and provide a good balance of games and 
  serious computing articles. One for the more serious and dedicated Amiga 
  user looking for more than just to play games.

  ##Amiga Addict - £78/year for 12 issues in the UK or £108/year outside UK

  The newest and most expensive print Amiga magazine available, now just 
  finishing their 1st year of publication the new magazine has been going 
  from strength to strength. Publishing exclusively in English, the 
  writing staff are trying to re-create the Amiga magazines of our 
  favourite computers heyday, Amiga Format, Amiga Power and CU Amiga. Each 
  issue comes in at around 58 pages in A4 format with glossy covers 
  featuring large artwork. The magazine covers a variety of Amiga topics 
  but concentrates mostly on games, interviews and software history. 
 
  The writing is fun and upbeat, taking you back to the British magazines 
  mentioned before. The magazine is published every month so you do not 
  have to wait too long for the latest issue. Amiga Addict is a love letter 
  to Amiga gaming and the community, it is bright and colourful with some 
  interesting inteviews with influential Amigans. While the concentration
  of articles is games which is understandable as the Amiga was 
  predominatly a games machine in the UK, it does have some serious 
  articles. 

  Recently they have started a series on C programming and the latest issue
  looks at how to use VistaPro which are welcome additions. If you are 
  looking for a magazine to bring you back to the old days of Amiga gaming, 
  then this is the magazine for you. It is a well produced magazine that 
  has a lot of content and is growing with each issue.

  ##Final Comments

  If you had told me 5 years ago we would have three print Amiga magazines
  in circulation I would have thought you crazy. As such I do not want to 
  criticise any of the magazines but I do want to be honest. Think of this
  last part as a breakdown to aid for the reader on making up their mind 
  regarding which is the magazine is for them, or maybe all of them! 
 
  ##Komoda & Amiga Plus

  * Well written and produced, 
  * Heavy on the games and the text is a little hard 
  * The covers are a thing of beauty and very eye catching
  * Targets the Commodore and Amiga games with some tutorials
    occasionally turning up  

  ##Amiga Addict
 
  * Professionally written and well put together
  * Concentrates mostly on games
  * Has some tutorials but the magazine is more geared towards the Amiga
    gamer
  * For the first time Amiga user or returnee, targeting the Amiga gamer
    and is not for the long time/more experienced user
 
  ##Amiga Future

  * Articles and reviews are quite in-depth and provide a lot of 
    technical information and detail. At the end of the day after reading
    Amiga Future I feel I have learnt something new. 
  * Not as games orientated as the other magazines.
  * Targeted at the more experienced Amiga users

  Finally I just want to thank all the writers on all three magazines, it 
  is has been a pleasure reading each magazine and the Amiga scene is in 
  a better and healthier place thanks to your hard work and contributions.

  Next issue we will be looking at the magazines that catered to the
  professional users, Amiga World and Amazing Computing!

============================================================================

  ##A1200 Onboard FPU Socket - Update

  Last issue we described the installation of an FPU socket onto the A1200
  motherboard, using the steps taken by Chris Edwards as a guide. In the 
  video Chris used a TF1230 as an example with the FPU showing up.  It
  had been hinted that this might also work with the TF1260, however we
  after testing the onboard FPU with a TF1260 is is unfortunately not the
  case. Installing the FPU and socket will not cause any issues with the
  TF1260 but you will need to use a card that contains an 020/030 or an 
  040 but it has not been possible to test this technique with an 040. 
   
  We apologise if the article made it seem that you could get FPU
  functionality via this route.  Sadly the only way to get FPU ability 
  with the TF1260 is by finding a *very* expensive 060 with FPU built
  in.

	       @{b}Interview - Eric Hill of Amiga Love@{ub}
============================================================================

  ##Hello, Eric thank you for agreeing to this short interview. To start off 
  can you tell us a little about yourself, who you are?

  Growing up I was a bit of a global nomad. I was born on Los Angeles in 
  1971 and had a good life there. But by the end of the 70s my parents were 
  really wanting a big change in their lives. Being teachers, they started 
  to mail resumes - I discovered later - to various countries including 
  Canada, Brazil and Singapore. My father received an offer from Singapore 
  first and they jumped at the opportunity. We lived there for 3 years 
  returning to the US in 1980. because my parents decided to divorce. 

  My mom raised my brother and myself almost single-handedly. We went from 
  Singapore to Texas, where she was from originally. It was a bit of a 
  culture shock to say the least. My formative years were spent in various 
  locations around the Dallas Ft. Worth Metroplex.

  In the early 90s I joined the Air Force and was stationed in central 
  California. Afterwards I returned to Texas to go back to finish college 
  and eventually entered art school as well. In the late 90s I worked for 
  some software and game companies before I jumped into the Dot-Com Boom 
  as a professional Web designer. I eventually moved to the Bay Area, 
  California. I was chasing a girl and thankfully it worked! In 2003 we 
  tied the knot and by 2007 started a family. 

  In 2011, I moved my family to Seattle, Washington. We love it here and I 
  think my nomadic ways are done. I've been a professional Web (and now 
  mobile) designer ever since. I'm the lead designer for Sporcle, the 
  largest trivia website in the world. 
   
  ##How did you get started in computers?
  
  I was always fascinated with video games and pixels on screens ever since 
  I first saw Space Invaders in a mall in Singapore. I remember begging my 
  mom for a quarter so I could play the game. As soon as my 1st man died she 
  was ready to go! I quickly informed her the game wasn't over, which wasn't 
  well-received. But she waited. I don't think I got to play the 3rd man!

  When we moved back to the US in 1980 my brother and I were given some sort 
  of Pong machine that hooked up to our 13" TV. There wasn't much to it, 
  really, but we thought it was something special. It even had some sort of 
  bizarre skeet shooting game. Soon after, we got an Atari 2600. Games back 
  then cost as much as they do now, but when you calculate the value of the 
  dollar games back then were painfully expensive - practically two times 
  today's prices! Needless to say getting new games wasn't easy for that 
  cartridge-based system. 
  
  I only got $1 a week allowance at the time. But I would save up and 
  sometimes buy home video game magazines. It was either that, or blow it 
  on 4 quarters in the arcade machines at the corner 7-11, or the dollar 
  movie theater down the street. I saw Flash Gordon 13 weeks in a row. 
  I'm not complaining! 

  The magazines I'd buy and read over and over would show the latest and 
  greatest for the 2600, Colecovision, Vectrex and Intellivision. 
  Eventually the early home consoles were taken over completely by powerful 
  home microcomputers in the magazine's coverage. 

  It quickly became obvious to me that the Commodore 64 was the ultimate 
  prize, and I devoured the reviews of its games first before going back to 
  Page 1 and reading the magazines again from cover to cover. The Vectrex 
  was a close 2nd, but there were usually only 1 or two games featured in 
  the entire mag each month. I did actually wind up buying a Vectrex, 
  however, with a combination of some Christmas money and some my mom 
  pitched in. How she afforded it I have no idea as she barely made ends 
  meet. I was in total heaven. Even my older brother, who wasn't as into 
  games as I was (he was more into D&D) admitted Pole Position on the 
  Vectrex was pretty cool. 

  In 1985 my parents sold their house in California and that helped change 
  things for us a bit. We moved to Arlington (home of the Cowboys and Texas 
  Rangers), where my mom bought a house. As a result, in 9th grade I finally 
  got my own room! And, more importantly, my mom helped me get a C64. I'll 
  never forget that feeling of complete and total excitement when I brought 
  it home. I soon realized, however, that I needed a disk drive in order to 
  do anything with the machine! The computer sat on my desk for about 2 
  weeks while I mainly just went through the manual and entered in some 
  short BASIC programs - losing them the moment I turned the machine off! 

  I soon received a disk drive, thank goodness (and it cost as much as the 
  computer!). I felt terribly guilty about having to go back to the store, 
  but I soon forgot that once I felt the power surge through my fingertips :)
 
  That year in school, I met a guy who was also big into the C64 and he had
  a modem. We quickly became best friends. That's when everything shifted 
  into a totally different gear. 
 
  ##What attracted you to Amiga computers over the competitors?
 
  As I've mentioned, I didn't have a magazine subscription nor any real 
  income. My only connection to the latest developments in the scene I 
  loved so dearly was my friend, Jason. He came from a well-off family 
  and his setup was impressive. He had dual drives, for starters, and an 
  actual Commodore monitor. And a modem, which I'd only ever seen in movies 
  or TV shows. And since his step-father was rather well-to-do, Jason could 
  even call BBSes in different states! His skills and reach left me in awe. 
 
  He'd regularly hand me disks (for free) so I could enjoy the same games he 
  was pulling down on a nightly basis. I remember getting one game, Top Gun, 
  a week before it was even available on retail shelves. 
 
  In any case, this was all before I was old enough to drive. I had a really 
  cheap used Montgomery Ward 10-speed bicycle, however. And on the weekends 
  I would sometimes ride several miles to the mall so I could see what new 
  titles were on the shelves at Babbages or Software Etc. 
  
  This one particular time, however, I rode past an office park and noticed 
  a Commodore logo on a store's black tinted glass. All the other buildings 
  were offices, so perhaps someone thought it strategic to put this store 
  out in the middle of nowhere. It had a few other logos on its glass that 
  I recognized (like Apple's) and I thought, "A store? Out here?", Intrigued 
  I rode my bike to the anonymous looking place and walked in. If this place 
  sold C64 software, I'd save at least 3 miles round-trip distance!

  Now back then - this would have been '86 or '87 - the computer salesmen 
  wore suits, like at a car dealership. It was a bit intimidating. I was a 
  pimply-faced teenager on a crappy 10-speed, not a dollar to my name. When 
  I first walked into the store I saw one of the salesmen stop his 
  conversation and give me a look. Unimpressed to act he soon went back to 
  his chatter with the other employee. 

  Regardless, in the middle of the main floor there was an impressive 
  display with 3 computers, each on their own tall white pedestal in a 
  circular fashion. Each machine had a monitor facing outward, the three 
  creating the shape of a 3-leafed clover if seen from above. My jaw dropped 
  to the floor when I saw the graphics on the first screen, which faced me 
  as I entered the store. It was as if I was looking at something straight 
  from Hollywood. It made no sense to my brain. As I recall, the screen had 
  a red Italian sports car on it. And it was animated. It looked f****ng 
  amazing. It was arcade-level, or honestly better.

  Mesmerized, after a few moments I walked around to the 2nd screen. Here, 
  I saw the legendary Juggler by Eric Graham, and my brain simply stopped 
  working. Next to the screen was a small rectangular clear acrylic stand 
  - very classy - with a thick white business card sticking out of it. The 
  card informed my broken brain that this was a Commodore computer! 
  
  A Commodore computer? I have a Commodore computer! I'm a HUGE Commodore 
  guy! But what the hell was I looking at? 
  
  I was practically gasping for breath and I felt my heart accelerate. I 
  was extremely confused, to say the least. 
  
  It's hard for me to express my utter shock when I saw the price on the 
  beautiful white business card sticking out of the acrylic stand. It had 
  only been a year or two since I'd convinced my mom to get me the computer 
  of my wildest dreams - the Commodore 64 - yet I'd never even heard of 
  this thing: Amiga. The price, though, made my stomach flip with instant 
  dismay. It was at this point that one of the two salesmen sauntered over 
  to me and asked if I had any questions. I stuttered something to the 
  affect of, "No, thanks. I'm just looking and just want to watch, if 
  that's OK." He nodded with a look that said, "I knew it!", and sauntered 
  back over to chat with the other guy. 

  That was when I knew something really big had happened, and I'd been 
  completely unaware. It was an epic thunderclap that left me deaf and 
  dumb. 
 
  The things I saw that day!
  
  It was equally both awe inspiring and devastating. Feeling way out of 
  my league, I soon left and jumped back on my bike. I rode as fast as I 
  could to the mall to look at the new C64 titles. But my vision had 
  forever been changed. 
 
  ##Are you more interested in the hardware, software or both?

  I'm very much interested in both, but with big caveats. 
  
  I'm completely addicted to the hardware I wish I could have owned from 
  1985-1990. I also love the operating systems and tools, public domain 
  software, productivity software and games. My particular focus is on NTSC 
  software, which is where most of the productivity software came from and 
  the game studios and publishers I admired: Electronic Arts, Activision, 
  Infocom, Origin, Luscasfilm, SSI, Epyx, Broderbund, Microproaw, Atari, 
  Interplay, FTL, Westwood Studios, Cinemaware, and on and on. And of course 
  if I sprinkle some of the top-shelf UK/EU studios into the mix there's 
  enough to keep my happy for a lifetime. 

  But my relationship with it all is, well, probably weird to some. I 
  absolutely adore OS 1.3. It's from the era I discovered the Amiga and, in 
  my opinion, when the Amiga had the most unbridled potential. 'Old Blue' 
  represents the time when, to me, the Commodore Amiga was at its most 
  magical and inspirational - when the Amiga seemed like it had come from 
  the future. 

  I love to collect and use hardware from that era. 

  The Amiga 3000 is about as far as I go. It's not that I don't appreciate 
  the later hardware and software - I do. But it doesn't hit my buttons 
  quite the same way. By 1993, there were Macintoshes and even PCs which 
  were lightyears ahead of Commodore (if you had the cash). In a weird 
  way, the later Amiga machines actually kind of bring me down sometimes. 
  Now look - if an A3000T or A4000 fell out of the sky of course I would 
  absolutely adore them. But my heart is really linked to the 'original' 
  Amigas: the A1000, 500, 2000 and 3000, which is probably my favorite 
  Amiga next to the A1000 these days. 

  I've just spent a lot of time talking about hardware, but the truth is I 
  really don't like to only focus on hardware constantly. It can get kind 
  of grindy for me after a while. I like my hardware to simply work and I 
  don't want to continuously fiddle with it. And I don't need to make it 
  some monster machine to enjoy myself. The software from the earlier Amiga 
  days is really where I like to spend my time. And when folks create *new* 
  software - especially for the older machines - that really makes my heart 
  sing. And most of the software I'm interested in was aimed at near-stock 
  Amiga 500. (Of course I do use machines with fun upgrades, but I try to 
  force myself to put a cap on it and leave things more or less 
  period-correct. But I do have some very cool upgraded machines (natch). 

  There was also a ton of amazing software made by individuals in the Public 
  Domain scene, which is completely fascinating to explore. The sad truth, 
  though, is that much of it was hobbled with nag-screens or chopped down 
  as demos to be 'unlocked' for a few bucks. As a result, a large portion 
  of what's found on Aminet or Fred Fish disks these days is what I now call 
  'Deadware'. But the hunt for awesome tools and experiences continues, and 
  it should offer many more years of entertaining exploration. 
 
  ##You created the website AmigaLove.com, can you tell us what drove you to 
  create the site?
 
  Back in 2015 or so I really got back into the scene. I'd always been 
  connected to the C64 and Commodore stuff, but I finally went all-in on 
  Amiga. I was in a place in my life where I could actually afford the 
  systems of my dreams. 
  
  But I soon became incredibly frustrated with the lack of information 
  online of how to actually do some of what I considered the most basic of 
  tasks. I could find the occasional YouTube video or meandering threads in 
  forums, but they were generally pretty hard to follow or didn't actually 
  tell me specifically what I was looking for. 

  Originally I thought I'd create a blog so I could create informative 
  articles that could be easily found by search engines (and people). But 
  I soon changed my mind. The Commodore scene was always about community. I 
  decided instead to build a forum where like-minded enthusiasts could share 
  experiences and support. And, I made sure it was mobile-friendly from the 
  very start, which most forums were not at the time. 
  
  I made a pledge to myself that I wouldn't post little clips and tidbits.
  So many of the forums I had used up to that point where usually filled 
  with advice from folks trying to be helpful, but with no solid answers or 
  instructions - just guesses and snippets of advice where you were expected 
  to fill in the gaps. Over time forums seemed to be a place I'd consider a 
  last resort to answer a question realizing I'd most likely just go running 
  down endless rabbit holes. 
  
  So, I decided that whenever I'd learned something - even the most obvious 
  to most - I would do my best to articulate the problem and its solution. 
  I knew others might some day find it helpful, but the truth is I wrote 
  posts so that I could follow my own steps later! I knew, at some point, 
  I'd want to do the exact same thing some day and I'd forget. Hah! 
  
  Thus, Amigalove.com became my own personal journal to assist my terrible 
  memory. I've been blessed to have so many wonderful people join the site 
  along the way and contribute as well. It's never truly taken off like 
  gangbusters, but that's OK because it is a bit easier to manage that way. 
  It also feels more tightly-knit as a result. 
  
  Interestingly, I think the name I chose - AmigaLove - has made folks 
  actually behave nicer than you might see elsewhere on the internet. You've 
  got to be a real Jack-a-loon if you come to Amigalove.com with an axe to 
  grind or an ego to prop up. 

  ##Your Amiga hardware looks in amazing condition. Was it hard keeping it in 
  such good condition? What tips do you have for other Amigans?

  There are several contributing factors to keeping our old machines looking 
  good. First and foremost, I only acquire minty looking hardware and 
  software. It has to meet a certain bar for it to even draw my interest. I 
  also have received life-time donations from some folks in the area and 
  around the country who took very good care of there things. 
  
  Second, since I live in Seattle, Washington, there is almost no humidity 
  to worry about. We do have a lot of moisture here half the year, but the 
  indoor air is very dry. Also, my 'retro room' is downstairs in a cool 
  basement so it's away from heat, which can also cause yellowing to some 
  plastics. Finally, I blacked out the windows of my computer room and 
  storage room, so UV can't find its way in. 
 
  ##You are also creating YouTube videos and managing AmigaLove.com, do you 
  plan to concentrate more on your YouTube channel?
  
  In the beginning when I was learning my way, I would just press record 
  and go for it all in a couple of takes. Over time, my process changed. Now 
  I write scripts and rewrite them multiple times. I'll create sometimes 
  hundreds of video clips and photos for a single video now. It's a lot of 
  work, but I find a great deal of pleasure building them this way now. But 
  I also have a full-time job and family. So, I only produce 1 video every 
  6 weeks or so. YouTube's algorithm doesn't like me very much as a result. 
  But I don't care about that. I make them for myself first, and the 
  community second. If it wasn't fun, I wouldn't do it at all because 
  there's zero financial incentive attached to it. And that's fine by me. I 
  purposefully don't monetize my website, either. 
  
  ##Are there any future features that want to add to AmigaLove.com?
  
  Yes. Just like the Games Library, I'd like to have a section for my 
  favorite 'tools' and other PD software available for download. This could 
  include files I've found on user group disks that I've never seen 
  elsewhere. 

  I also have been working off-and-on on an upgraded Fred Fish archive. I 
  hope to have more to say about that in 2023. 

  ##And umm sorry but we have to ask how ... many Amigas do you have?
  
  Well, this is a little embarrassing. . . 
  
  Amiga Development System (Zorro edition)
  Amiga 1000 (stock) 
  Amiga 1000 'Phoenix' 
  Amiga 1000 'Rejuve' - my daily driver. This machine has a 2mb chip 
        Rejuvenator with KS 1.3 and ICD AdSpeed @ 14Mhz. This machine 
        also has a Microbotics Starboard, StarDrive R2 with 1GB 
        microSD, and 8MB modern RAM SLAM board. Finally, it also has 
        A-Max installed on a partition System 6.0.8. Sometimes I 
        remove the Starboard and replace it with the fantastic 
        Parceiro by David Dunklee. 
  Amiga 500  rev 5 'Chickenlips' 
  Amiga 2000 Filled to the brim with period correct upgrades 030 @ 40Mhz.
  Amiga 3000 With factory installed dual-ROM (1.3 and 2.0)
  Amiga 3000 With 060, ZZ9000, bigRAM, etc. 
 
  And I was gifted a re-capped original NTSC A600 HD which I've left stock 
  as an occasional testing machine. 

  ##Of all your Amigas what is your favorite model and why?
 
  Every Amiga is awesome. But these days I flip flop between the A1000 and 
  A3000 - and honestly I'm on the 1000 the most. There's hardly anything I 
  want to use that can't run on that machine. But if I need more 
  performance, the 3000 is just so ultra gorgeous and bad ass I just slide 
  over there. 

  ##Thank you for taking the time to answer our questions, I am sure 
  that I say this for all Amiga users that we greatlu appreciate your work 
  in creating AmigaLove, it plays a large role in the Amiga scene. 

  Is there anything else that you would like to say before we finish?

  Thank YOU for giving me the opportunity to talk at length about my favorite 
  past-time!

@node hernain "Hernain Interview"
@toc talkingamiga
===========================================================================
	 @{b}Interview - Hernain, Amiga Animator and Artist@{ub}
===========================================================================

  ##Hi Hache, to start with can you tell us a little about yourself?

  Hi! My name is HernÃ¡n, but you can callme "H" (yep, like the letter) I am 
  from Buenos Aires, Argentina and I'm 41 years old. Regarding my job, I am 
  a professional animator and I have worked on a feature film called 
  Condorito The Movie and some TV animated shows such as "Talking Tom and 
  Friends". I currently work as 2D/3D animator for mobile games. Also I have 
  a Youtube Channel about retrogaming, called "Retrocidad". We do tutorials, 
  and live streams and cover all kinds of retro systems using real machines, 
  among them the Amiga 500, for sure!
 
  ##How did you get started with computers?
  
  My first contact with a computer was in 1985, a Christmas present that our 
  parents gave to my brother and me. It was a Microdigital TK90X. It is a 
  Brazilian clone of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. With this machine I started in 
  the world of video games. I was only 4 years old, but my brother is older 
  than me so at that time I just watched him play, until I grew up a little.
  
  ##What got you into the Amiga?
  
  I'm an Amiga user since in 1989 with my first Amiga 500 our parents gave us 
  to me and my brother. I still have this machine with me and I still using 
  it. It was a great impact for us, for its multimedia capabilities, 
  especially because we have gone from a Spectrum to an Amiga 500. The jump 
  was really really huge.

  ##Recently you redid the Dragon`s Lair II Time Warp animated introduction
  can you tell us why you chose to do this?

  Well, It all started one day when I wondered to my self: "What would the 
  Dragon's Lair II intro look like, if it had been released on the Amiga? So, 
  what I did was draw only one frame just for fun (the first shot where the 
  kids talk) to see the look and that was it, I didn't do anything else. Then, 
  fifteen days later I said: "Wait... How would this other frame look like, 
  if the intro had existed on the Amiga?". So I drew another frame of Mordroc 
  and Daphne faces in closeup. Then a couple of days after I was like, "Hey! 
  What if I do the whole intro?" So that's how it was! Just to do a testing 
  of a couple of frames for fun I ended up doing the entire intro. I'm crazy, 
  I know!!!
 
  ##You recreated the animation in Personal Paint, why did you choose this 
  particular art programme over the likes of DPaint or Brilliance?
 
  As you said, the animation is made from scratch, frame by frame in Personal 
  Paint based on the original frames. I love and choose Personal Paint because 
  it has a very powerful bezier curve tool, similar to vectorial curves in 
  Adobe Illustrator. For sure it's not magic, but they speed up the work a 
  lot when it comes to drawing.
  
  ##What was the most difficult part of the recreating the animation?
 
  Then most difficult part was recreating the facial expressions in the shots 
  where the character was far away from camera. Remember this animation is at 
  320x256 so you couldn't see so much detail. I have suffered this more in 
  Princess Daphne, since she has very delicate facial expressions and hand 
  poses. I tried to take care of the detail as much as I could.

  ##What was the easiest part?

  The easiest part was the shot where Mordoc is flying with Daphne and says 
  "MINE!". This shot, actualy, is a copy of a previous shot, when Mordroc is 
  flying with Daphne and sticks his face next to hers. So all I had to do 
  was duplicate the shot, and just re-animate Mordroc's mouth to say the 
  word.

  ##Do you plan to re-create any other introductions?

  I would love to recreate the Space Ace intro or the animated Tintin TV 
  Show (I love Tintin). I'm between those two, but I can't decide yet.

  ##Apart from the Dragon`s Lair II introduction what other graphic work 
  have you done on the Amiga and where can we find them?

  Well, I've made an animation recreating a shot of the Pink Panther Show 
  that won in the animation category on the Amiga Art Contest 2021. You can 
  watch it here:

  Also I've worked in an Amiga Game called The Dream of Rowan. I did all the 
  graphics, the 3D animated intro and outro. This was the first time doing 
  graphics for an Amiga game.
  
  ##Which hardware do you use for creating you art/animations?
  
  I use WinUAE to create my animations. I don't make them using a real 
  machine for several reasons: First, because of the loading and saving 
  times. Second, I can set the emulator at high speed and be able to work 
  much faster. And third, I can't imagine doing this kind of work on a CRT 
  monitor. I would go really blind!
  
  ##If the prices of the newer Amiga hardware such as the Vampire drop, 
  would you consider working on those machines as well or would you rather 
  stick to the classic Amigas?
  
  Well, I have no experience in Vampire, but I might consider it if I try 
  one and it meets my expectations.
  
  ##What other computers and Amigas do you own, do you also do graphic 
  work on the other machines?
  
  Amiga 500: 512Kb Expansion
  Amiga 600: 1Mb Chip expansion + 4Mb Fast Ram Expansion
  Amiga 1200: ACA 1232, 030, 128Mb.
  Amiga 1200: Terrible Fire 1230, 030, 128Mb
  
  ##What do you like most about creating graphics on the Amiga?
 
  Doing this for me it is a kind of therapy. I love everything related to 
  animation in any of its styles. Seeing what you create, from literally 
  NOTHING, is coming to life is something very satisfying. On Amiga I love 
  to draw and curiously I also really like the work of choosing the palette. 
  How many and which colors I will use to make the animation.

  ##If you could have any Amiga setup you want, what would it be?
  
  Actually, I'm really happy with my 030 Amiga, but I'd love to experience 
  an 060 processor or why not a Vampire. I have never had experience in 
  either and it would be something great and totally new for me.
 
  ##Thank you for your time, do you have any thing you would like to say 
  before we finish?
 
  First of all, thank you for this interview. Greetings to all the comunity 
  and AMIGA FOREVER!!!

  ##Brilliance II Tips =Kev_Portrait= for the Amiga Art Contest 2022

  Creating pixel artwork on the Amiga is very rewarding especially if it's 
  only available on the Amiga such as Brilliance software.  Recently I 
  completed a self-portrait using Brilliance II for the Amiga Art Contest 
  2022 that is closing this month, so please if you can either create art, 
  animations or music enter the competition. As you may know, I have the 
  honour alongside 'Doug - 10Marc' on judging the entries.  My entry as 
  you can imagine is not valid but I wanted to enter for the fun of it 
  and hopefully encourage others.


  This time I wanted to create a digital self-portrait using the Amiga's 
  Low Res screen resolution of 320 x 256 pixels and 256 colours.

  If you want to see the actual image I created for the 'Hand Drawn 
  Category', please visit this post.

  The source IFF file and small tutorial are here for your viewing
  https://www.patreon.com/posts/72264784

  Or this YouTube video
  https://youtu.be/mTSUl6VYAZE

  In the speed painting on youtube you can see custom pixel editing 
  alongside three other main tools I used:

	* Draw Mode RubThru, Brighten/Darken, and Fix Background

	* Rub-Thru Tool:
	  One of the other effects I used was the Rub-Thru technique. This 
  	  is where you have two screens loaded into Brilliance and pressing 
  	  the 'J' key toggles between those screen buffers. In the 
  	  background buffer, I first drew a few chips on a circuit board as 
	  I wanted it to appear in the other portrait image.  With careful 
 	  positioning of the circuit board (I used the cut screen with a 
	  brush and placed it into the correct location. 

	* Brighten/Darken Tool:
	  Sometimes when adding shade to a large area of the screen that is 
	  quite complex, it is worth setting up (drawing) a brush stamp to 
	  pastedown an effect. So in my Patreon post, you'll see I have 
 	  created a white blockwork area of pixels, this white area is the 
	  area I want to create a shadow with multiple levels of shade.  I 
	  could do this manually but this technique is far quicker.

	* Fix Background Tool:
	  First, you open an image you want to edit/enhance. Then select 
 	  the 'Fix/Background' (Padlock icon), this allows you to draw over 
	  the image without destroying the pixels, think of it as a 
    	  temporary extra layer you can work on. Draw the area you want a 
	  shadow using all the tools at your disposal such as line, box, 
	  circle, and pixel tools. Once you have drawn this shadow (I used 
	  white to easily stand out). Cut the brush out using the 'B' key, 
	  then clear the screen by clicking the 'CLR' (clear screen).  You 
	  will notice your original image is still intact.  Now select the 
	  Darken too in the 'Draw Mode' menu. I would also adjust the 
	  'amount' percentage to something like 15%. Press down the white 
	  brush you have onto the area you want to add the shadow to, 
  	  remember each time you stamp down the shadow it adds extra shadow 
	  which is very handy if you want a gradual shadow effect that you 
	  see in real life.

  ##I would like to spend time in the new year creating more tutorials so 
  please contact me if you have a suggestion.

  Take care and Amiga Forever.

			@{b}Next Issue - 1.08 December 2022@{ub}
============================================================================

 Thank you for reading issue 8, I must apologise that we were unable to
 get all the content promised in last issue but life has a way of getting
 in the way. However the next issue due out in December will be a big one 
 for us as we will celebrate our first year. The time has just flown by
 and since starting the magazine it seems to have gone even faster, we
 started around the same time as Amiga Addict and have seen them go from
 strength to strength and I hope that we are doing the same.  For the
 December issue we will have reviews of the A1200.net case, Kickdrum Sample
 Maker, and a look back at FinalWriter. In additon we will look back to the
 US based Amiga magazines Amiga World and Amazing Computing, comparing them
 to the UK magazines.  Hopefully, we will also have DiskMimic and AGA
 Blaster/Converter guides plus the return of MsMadLemon. All in all it 
 should be a great Xmas/one year anniversary issue.  See you then!
