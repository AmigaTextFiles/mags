Ho hum....

I'll give it up the day that you can "out-multitask" my A4000T/060 
which beats the pants off your Pentium in useful computing, ease of 
use, time saved in not constantly re-installing or just looking for a 
program.

Why are so many PC users downloading UAE?

You are going to be dining on "Crow" when the PowerUp boards arrive.

But in soime fairness I DO like some of the hardware PCs' have 
available, shame about Win95 though.


Excuse me a minute, I'm rendering whilst in the middle of a multi IRC 
session and Shapeshifter is doing something on the other screen, I'll 
click the mouse and have a look..... ahh... it's showing a Quicktime 
movie.

Dopus5 is busy formatting two disks at the same time, don't you love 
the way you can just "Drag n Drop" an archived file and watch it self 
extract. For that matter it's also nice to be able to have a look 
inside an archived file BEFORE" you un-archive it... sorry, DPaint 
informs me that it's finished making a 600 frame animation.


Bye :)
