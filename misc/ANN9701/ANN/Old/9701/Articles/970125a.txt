We like to say "CHRP", it's a pronouncable acronym. We're very close
to CHRP, and looking at the difference right now. The first prototype
isn't quite CHRP (it's an enhanced PReP), but by production, maybe, at
least at the hardware level.

It hasn't been an issue yet, though we may at some point look into it.

We have been approached by Apple, and talked with them somewhat. No
promises yet, but clearly it's the largest PowerPC market out there,
so it's worth consideration.
