                          BACK TO PERSONAL COMPUTING
                                       
   
   
   A Message from Carl Sassenrath
   20-Jan-1997
   
   For more than 16 years Carl Sassenrath has been a leading innovator in
   the field of operating system technology for companies like Hewlett
   Packard, Apple, Amiga, and Commodore. Mr. Sassenrath is best known as
   the architect of the Amiga multitasking OS kernel, a fast, efficient
   system which pioneered the concepts of dynamically loadable libraries
   and devices. (More Info)

Are You Satisfied?

   
   
   We live in the age of tremendous personal computing power. Our desktop
   systems run hundreds of times faster than the large, expensive
   mainframe computers of years past. Yet, what has been the end result
   of this unbelievable power? Are you now satisfied with the operation
   of your system? Does it operate and respond as you expect?
   
   Over the past decade the benefits of increased hardware performance
   have been offset by an excessive growth in the size and complexity of
   the system software. Or perhaps it is the opposite -- the driving
   force behind improving hardware performance was to overcome an
   ever-growing ineptitude in software technology. After all, how useable
   would Windows95 be on a 8 MHz computer?
   
The Complexity Problem

   
   
   The developers of modern software don't understand the consequences of
   their bloated systems on their users. Operating personal computers now
   requires us to devote as much time to set-up menus, installation
   programs, configuration "wizards", and help databases as we do running
   productive applications. Companies like Microsoft mistakenly think
   that we either have plenty of time to burn or perhaps actually enjoy
   endlessly fooling around with their system.
   
   This mindless attitude seems to manifest itself in every aspect of
   modern software, from the development systems needed to create it, to
   the application libraries (APIs) required to interface it, to the
   operating systems necessary to run it. This plague has swept through
   all aspects of computer software -- as is evident when you download a
   10MB C++ shareware program, install an 80MB OS update, or receive a 10
   CD-ROM developer's kit.
   
   Many developers defend their software by arguing: "What is the harm
   with a 10MB program? Don't you know that memory is cheap?" What they
   are really saying is: "So what if it takes some time to download. Who
   cares that it consumes disk space and half the RAM. Perhaps
   configuring it is a little too complicated. Alright, it does have many
   useless features. But, after all, it has less than a dozen obvious
   bugs, and it will run at least an hour before crashing."
   
   These developers fail to recognize the core problem: software
   complexity. In recent years it has become universally acceptable for
   software technology to be absurdly complex. Systems have grown both
   out of control and out of proportion to their benefits, becoming
   wasteful, brittle, clumsy and slow. Like our federal government, these
   complex software systems are now perpetuated by thriving bureaucracies
   of non-thought, propelled by their own markets of desperate,
   inexperienced consumers who see no alternatives.
   
Back to the Future

   
   
   I have reached my limit when it comes to "modern" software practices.
   Over the past few years I've been dreaming not of the future, but the
   past. Perhaps you remember those days... when a word processor was
   distributed on a single floppy and what seemed like a huge OS took
   two. Remember being wonderfully productive on a 7MHz system with a
   10MB hard drive? If something went wrong, you felt that there was a
   good chance you could fix it yourself.
   
   To me this is all about Personal Computing, not Personal Enslaving. It
   is about being the masters of our own computers, not the reverse. A
   decade ago this was true, but we are not the masters any more. Is it
   possible to reclaim that position? Or, has it been lost to history
   like the Tucker Automobile? Everyone tells me that the world of
   personal computing is now totally dominated by a single system -- one
   which I believe lacks not only a consistent, efficient, reliable
   architecture, but an intelligent vision of the future.
   
   Perhaps we are at a pivotal point in personal computing, and this is
   where we must take our stand. It is my sincere hope that there are
   enough scattered outposts of rebels who believe as I do and refuse to
   bow to the "empire" (or have done so under duress and seek an
   opportunity to flee.) With a critical mass we can build our own future
   and return to what Personal Computing was meant to be.
   
My Part

   
   
   For years after creating the Amiga's multitasking OS architecture I
   assumed operating systems would continue to improve. I figured that
   with five million people using the Amiga and valuing its design, I had
   made my contribution. I set aside my new OS visions, naively thinking
   that others would carry the torch onward toward the best possible
   future. I know now that I made a mistake, and I have come to regret
   it.
   
   I am now prepared to develop the system that I have been contemplating
   for the last decade. I'm not talking here about making a clone of any
   existing system (including the Amiga). What I want is a personal
   computer that I would like to use: a system that is genuinely
   easy-to-operate, consistent, flexible, powerful, small, and fast.
   
   My plan involves two phases. The first phase is the completion of a
   new scripting and control language. I have worked on the design of
   this language part-time for many years. Within the last few months my
   efforts have been full-time, and the language is nearly ready for its
   prototype (alpha) release. Versions will be available for each of the
   major platforms over the next month.
   
   Why a language? Because I believe that the core of computing is not
   based on operating system or processor technologies but on language
   capability. Language is both a tool of thought and a means of
   communication. Just as our minds are shaped by human language, so are
   operating systems shaped by programming languages. We implement what
   we can express. If it cannot be expressed, it will not be implemented.
   
   
   Once the language is complete and in distribution, the second phase is
   to develop a small and flexible operating system which is integrated
   in a unique way with the language. Attribute settings, control
   scripts, configuration, installation, interprocess communications, and
   distributed processing will be facilitated through the language.
   Applications can still be written in C and various other languages,
   but some aspects of their system interface will be done through the OS
   language. This system is slated for prototype release later in the
   year and will be targeted at a few different hardware platforms.
   
Your Part

   
   
   The language and system described above are huge projects and will
   require my best efforts for some time to come. This is my sole
   mission, and I have no other jobs or contracts to help pay the way.
   Yet, I have absolutely no intention of selling out to a big
   corporation or being driven by Wall Street greed. To do so would be to
   risk losing control (again) to those who lack the insight and
   understanding to make the best decisions in the years ahead.
   
   Instead, my approach is to determine if there are enough of you out
   there who feel as I do -- who want a choice, who want a system that
   makes you the master, and who would be willing to help support it
   through financial contributions.
   
   I've been considering this for many months, but I've never done a
   user-funded project like this before, and I don't know what to expect.
   Right now I am hopeful, but also a little nervous. It's a big risk. If
   you like what I am proposing, please take to it to heart and consider
   what I have said, because I cannot do it without you.
   
   It's time to do something different. It's time to do something for
   ourselves. I hope you will join with me, rebel against software
   complexity, and return us again to being the masters of our own
   Personal Computing.
   
   Yours as always,
