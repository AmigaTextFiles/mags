Hi everyone,

So, I e-mailed to Dan Robinson, Director of Buisness Development for
Amiga Computers.  He said that he hasn't read the interview, and that
they must have misquoted him.  He said that they are "exploring both the
Alpha and the PowerPC as the CPU for future Amiga Systems".

So there you have it.
