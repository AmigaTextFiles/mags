Subject ........: Microsoft was at the last Amiga auction in NYC

Those of you who question MicroSoft's involvement with the Amiga
might remember that MS was at the NYC auction a few years back.

But they were not there to buy anything; they were there to file
a claim against a debt that CBM owed MS. It is possible MS is still
looking to claim on that debt.

Also MS would probably love to either kill the Video Toaster market,
or control it. Didn't they buy a popular 3D package last year?
Even SGI released a computer that supposedly resembles a "toaster".

IBM was there (in NYC last time) to clarify their patent agreements. 

etc
