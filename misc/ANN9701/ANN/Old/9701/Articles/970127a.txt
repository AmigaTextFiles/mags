I hate to be the one to tell you, you are wrong. I know from first hand 
experience that there are 5 bidders for AT,  Sony, Microsoft, Viscorp and CEI 
are NOT BIDDING!!!!!. QP is bidding but they are the lowest bid and have not 
proved they have any money!!.  Whoever the successfull bidder is, you should all 
know VERY shortly.
