Subject ........: ANNOUNCE: World of Amiga Show for the UK!!!

To All:

I have just had a press release from the organisers of the last World
of Amiga Show asking me for a quote on the news they organising a new
show, set down for May 17th & 18th

It is being held in London at the Novatel (where it ws held last
time).

For where I sit, this is just the boost the UK Amiga needs and with
some new projects due to be released around that time, it should be a
very interesting time of the year. Hopefully, all those in the UK in
Amiga misc would like to express how they feel about this impending
show.

I expect most of the Amiga press will have news items on this in their
next issues.
