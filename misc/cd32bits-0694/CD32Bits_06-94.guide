Well, it's certainly been a quiet month as far as the CD32 goes, with
only a handful of new games titles being released.  Hopefully this
situation will be rectified next month!!

Last month, I asked for readers of this magazine to drop me a note if
they had FMV on their CD32's....  Well, it seems that magazines like AUI
are correct to not use FMV on their disks yet, because I only got one
measily reply.  If I didn't know better, I would think that nobody was
reading this!!!!!  Seriously though, What are your opinions?  I really
would like some input!!   To all you Americans, are you able to get the
FMV module yet??

The new edition of CD32 Gamer is out now, but has already gone up in
price from £4 to £5, which is a bit strange seeing that there is much
less on the cover CD.  Originally, the magazine was going to be
published quarterly, but now it's bi-monthly.  Hopefully, if the high
cover price is going to continue they will include better stuff on the
disk.  After all, the CD is the reason that most people buy the CD.

@node comm "The Big C="

At last, conformation has arrived of Commodores situation.  It has come
to light that SAMSUNG, the monitor manufacturer has bought C= outright.
It would seem that Samsung has sufficient financial power to inject new
life into the machine, whilst not affecting it in any adverse way.
Hopefully, they will start to bundle monitors with their machines.  It
has also been stated that once up to full power, the long awaited AAA
(Triple A) chipset will be ready within a month.  Surely a tall order,
but that is what they are saying...

There was also the worrying reports that Phillips (CD-I) had bought all
rights to the CD32.  Fortunately these dispersed rapidly.  It seems that
the rumours stemmed from a meeting between C= and Phillips with concerns
to the CD32.  It's purpose was, in fact to ensure that future Video CD
releases would be white book, and not in the format that Phillips had
previously been using which caused the films to jump when used on
suitably equipped CD32's.  (EG Patriot Games).
@endnode
@node cont "Theres a new CD32 Controller About!!!"

At long last, someone has released a replacement joypad which no CD32
user should be without.  It's called the Super CD32 and is manufactured
by Competition Pro.

It features all of the controls found in the normal pad, so there will
be no incompatability problems with either games or FMV movies.  Plus,
it has additional functions which allow you to slow down a game, have
autofire, or the ability to have turbo fire, which means you will be
able to destroy the baddies much quicker.

The Super CD32 pad wins hands down over the normal pad, and at £19.99,
is a fair price too!!
@endnode
@node fmvp "New ROMS for FMV!!"

Apparantly, the jumping, and general loss of sync found when using CDI
films on the CD32 can now be solved by getting replacement ROMS from
Commodore.  The cost is said to be about £5, but you will need an
authorised engineer to fit them....  If you return the FMV module to
your dealer, they should be able to do the upgrade for you.

@node chuc "Chuck Rock II"

             Chuck Rock II           Core Design             £30


It's nice to see a sequel which is good.  Especially when the original
was an absolute turkey.  Chuck Rock 2 opens with a brilliant cartoon
style animation, which is equally as good as similar, on-screen cartoons
such as The Flintstones.  You play Chuck junior, and it is your mission
to romp through the prehistoric fun-filled levels in an attempt to
rescue your dad, who has been kidnapped by his arch enemy Brick Jagger.

The gameplay, whilst simplistic is a lot of fun, and for once, the awful
CD32 controller does not hinder you too much.  The graphics are quite
nice, as are the sound effects, all of which will probably keep you
coming back for more.  You could do a lot worse than to get this!!

@node fire "Fire and Ice"

              Fire and Ice            Renegade             £25

One of the old classics makes a welcome return to the CD32.  You play
Cool Coyote who must travel the 30 levels rescuing his pups whilst
killing a whole host of baddies to obtain the key that allows you to
leave the level.  The graphics and soundtrack are perfect, and there is
even an option to use the same music as in the original, which is great
for all of you nostalgic old timers out there.

However, Fire and Ice has too major problems.  First of course, as with
almost every other game is the crappy controller.  A lot of the game
requires precise movement, and this is just not possible.  Fortunately,
a normal joystick will allow you much more control.  Secondly, for some
reason, the screen position is offset to the right.  This is really
annoying, and as far as I can see, there is no way of fixing this.
Still though, Fire and Ice is a very enjoyable game.

@node guns "Gunship 2000"

              Gunship 2000            Microprose           £30

When I spoke to one of the representatives on the Microprose stand at
the ECTS, all he could talk about was the Silicon Graphics rendered
introduction.  I can see why, but unfortunately it is not because it is
particularly impressive.  The reason is because the game is seemingly no
different.  He told me that it was a direct port to CD of the original
game, but according to the packaging it definately is AGA.  Now, this it
may be, but not so that you could notice it.  All I could see was that
the game was slowed down a great deal, even with all of the terrain
options on low quality.
The gameplay is now extremely difficult, and using the different number
of combinations of direction+button to control the helicopter is not
instinctive and will take a lot of practise.  The sound effects are now
digital quality, so sound a lot better, but that, to me does not
constitute a major upgrade.
As for the intro, well even if it was rendered on an SGI, Microprose
have made a hash of converting it to run on the CD32.  It is one of the
worst examples of CDXL that I have so far seen.  It just looks like a
collection of line sketches that have been joined together.
In conclusion, Gunship is a great game, but this release does it no
justice.  By all means buy it if you do not already have the original
version, but if you do, you will just be wasting your money.

@node huma "Humans 1+2"

              Humans 1+2              Gametek               £30

Gametek's second release for the CD32 is much better than the first,(I
will leave it to you to find out what the first was!!).  It is a
combination of both of the Lemmings-Like puzzlers that were originally
released 2 years ago.  In the game, you control a tribe of men who have
to use their various abilities together in order to get through levels.
EG A stationary man that can be climbed over to reach previously
inaccesible areas.  In the game you can pick up various objects to aid
your task like sticks to pole vault with, and burning objects to ward
off dinosaurs.  The game has hundreds of levels, and only the most
addicted players will ever get throught them all.  As ever, the
controller does not help matters, but this is easily remedied with
either a mouse or the new Super CD32 pad.

@node naug "Naughty Ones"

            Naughty Ones            Interactivision         £26

Naughty Ones is an exact port of the A1200 version released two months
ago. It is a cutesy platform game, which will definately appeal to the
younger audience.  The graphics are very bright and colourful, and the
sound complements the game nicely.  As with most games, it is best
played with a friend, where the obstacles can be overcome by joining
together and helping each other.  As platformers go, this is quite good!

@node ryde "Ryder Cup Golf"

                Ryder Cup             Ocean             £30

Ryder Cup Golf is one of those games which I cannot help feeling
indifferent about.  It has nice graphics, bad sound effects, good fast
screen updates and difficult controls.  The bad cancels out the good,
and you are left with a pretty standard Golf sim.  It's better than Nick
Faldo (Grandslam), but far inferior to PGA Tour Golf.

@node stri "Striker"

                Striker             Gremlin             £30

How many crap football games do we have to sit through before we get a
decent one for the CD32.  Sensible Soccer had huge possibilities and
missed them.  Striker doesn't even have those possibilities in the first
place.  It features crappy small insignificant graphics, way too fast
action, and bog standard sound (appart from the CD tracks).  It cost £20
more than the floppy version which is also overpriced...  What can I
say??  It's a football game.    YAWN!!

@node ulti "Ultimate Body Blows"

         Ultimate Body Blows             Team 17            £30

UBB is by far the best beat 'em up available for the Amiga, and possibly
any other format.  You may think that is a rash statement, but when you
see it, you opinion may well change.  UBB features 22 characters for you
to pick from,  has incredibly detailed backdrops, amazing sound and
speed that MUST be faster than the highly boring Street Fighter 2 Turbo.

The disk has a built in electronic manual, 16 digital tracks and the
option to play with either the normal controller, or a standard
joystick.  In game, there are a huge number of special moves to be had,
and when playing against a friend, the action is at its best.

If you are remotely interested in Beat Em Up's, this is the game for
you, and a must for virtually anyones CD32 game collection.  Of all of
the games available at the moment this is by far the best.  It would
have got full marks if it were not for the control method when using the
CD32 pad.

@node zool "Zool 2"

                        Zool 2          Gremlin         £30

I wont go into the plot behind Zool, because I am sure that you all have
a good idea what the whole thing is about, but what I will say is that
this effort from Gremlin is much better than the original.  In similar
style to the original Zool, this opens with a Silicon Graphics Rendered
intro which is quite impressive.  That is where the similarities to the
first Zool stop.  The major problem with the first was that it was
enhanced for AGA machines.  Therefore the backgrounds tended to be far
too colourful, and you could often miss objects that needed to be picked
up, much in the style of Oscar.  This release however was designed for
the new(ish) generation of machines, and does not suffer this problem.  

The CD32 version features extra levels, digital soundtracks and two
characters to choose from, although the female one is nowhere near as
easy to use as the original Zool.  The gameplay is simple, and movement
fluid, although if you use the options to have no inertia and Zool in
turbo mode, the sprite is impossible to control.  In conclusion, Zool 2
is a worthy choice if you are looking for a platform game, but at £30 is
a tad expensive.  At the moment, GAME (UK), the computer store is selling the
original Zool for £10, and although it falls short of it's sequel in
quality, it's a much better deal.

@node prev "HOT TITLE COMING!!"

Rise of the Robots looks set to become a major title on the CD32 when it
is released this September.  It is set to provide the ultimate combat
game for current machines due to its amazing gameplay and gorgeous
graphics.

'Rise' has been created using 3D modelling software that produces high
quality ray traced graphic images that are more realistic, more animated
and more controllable than ever before.  In fact, it uses the same
techniques that were used to produce the special effects in Jurassic
Park and Terminator II.  The game also features spectacular animation
sequences throughout the game, giving it a movie-like feel.



The plot is set in Metrolpolis 4 in the vast Electrocorp bulding where
military and industrial robots are manufactured.  All humen staff have
been replaced by a super intelligent liquid metal morphing robot - the
'Supervisor', which has been programmed to manage the whole complex and
its production.  An ego virus has infected the Supervisor causing it to
take over the security defences of the complex and the other robots
within it.

In a desperate attempt to save the complex, the Company has sent in a
Cyborg which is immune to the virus.  The Cyborg has been created from
robotic and human parts and has transmitters which connect it to the
Electrocorp digital information network.  It has no firepower to
minimize damage.

The ultimate challenge is the Supervisor, who special moves include
melting to avoid a punch, forming anvils and spikes for hands, and
turning into a metal block as a defence.



The player controls the Cyborg in battles against five types of enemy

@node pinb "Pinball Fantasies"

        To ensure that you always get the extra ball, hold down the red
button as soon as the third ball drops.  If this doesnt work on your
copy, press the yellow button the number of times that it says at the
top of the screen when you lose the last ball.

        Also, if you have a keyboard, all of the typed cheat work.

             extra balls - gives you two extra balls
             gravity     - makes your ball ultra-responsive to gravity

@node movie "FMV Videos"

Due to the, shall we say, sparseness of the new games this month, I
thought that I would take the opportunity to cover the @{"FMV" system "ppshow fmv.jpeg"} titles that
have been released so far.  There will be a short description of the
film, a rating and a comment on it's quality.  If you can think of anything
else which needs to be said about the films, let me know!!

@node blac "BLACK RAIN"

Stars    : Michael Douglas, Andy Garcia and lots of Japanese actors..
Director : Ridley Scott
Cert.    : 18
Length   : 125 Mins


        Now, anyone who know's anything about Ridley Scott, director of
The Aliens Trilogy and Blade Runner, will go into this film expecting 
great things.  Unfortunately, Black Rain just does not live up to Ridley 
Scott's name, and is certainly not a film that you would want to watch 
more than a few times.

        Douglas plays a New York Cop who strongarms his way through the
Japanese underworld in pursuit of the maverick gangster who killed his 
buddy.  The film contains lot's of killing, which is reflected by the
fact that it is the only FMV title at the moment to have an 18 rating.

The tried and tested method of a cop seeking revenge combined with Scott's
very dark style of film-making should have produced a sure fire hit, but
it seems to fall at the first hurdle.  It is doubtful that you will 
watch this more than a couple of times other than to freeze-frame the
shot where Andy Garcia is decapitated by a Samurai Sword.

@node ghos "GHOST"

Stars    : Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg
Director : Jerry Zucker
Cert     : 15
Length   : 121 Mins


        This is by far the best title available on Video CD at the 
present time.  It is in White Book format, so the quality of the 
production is seamless, with perfect sound and no jumping.  Well done 
Paramount.  The only problem that I could find was that the film only 
comes in Wide Screen, which means that you have two black bands above
and below the main picture, although the film is so enjoyable that you 
soon forget that the bars are there.

        It's a wraith against time as the restless spirit of a murdered 
man (Swayze) tries desperately to warn the love of his former life 
(Moore) that the hoodlum who killed him is out ot get her too.  He finds
a charlatan psychic (Goldberg) who is amazed to find that her powers are
for real and eventually agrees to help him.  Ghost is a love story, a 
thriler and a comedy all thrown into one, and a serious tear jerker!!

        Definately one for the ladies, and probably one for the men too!
                                BUY IT NOW!!

@node hunt "The Hunt For Red October"

Stars    : Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin and Sam Neill
Director : John McTiernen
Cert     : PG
Length   : 137 Mins


        From the director of Die Hard comes The Hunt For Red October, 
the tale of a Russian Navy Commander trying to defect to the US.

        It isn't only the Americans who see red when a Soviet super-sub 
skipper skips, and heads his hi-tech craft straight for them.  The 
Russians do, too.  For neither side is really sure whether the Ruskie 
runaway is a renegade who wants to start a war, or a defector who wants 
to stop one.

        There's not much on the action front in this movie and it is
doubtful that you will want to watch it much more than a couple of
times. Whilst maintaining a tense atmosphere throughout, it fails to 
pack a punch like McTiernens other smash hit, Die Hard.  Story by the 
Author of Patriot Games.

Stars    : Leslie Nielson, Priscilla Presley
Director : Bob Weiss
Cert     : PG
Length   :


        Dire sequel to the original Naked Gun, which wasn't particularly 
funny itself.  Same old jokes and sketches, in fact it's pretty much the 
same as the first.  Leslie Nielson plays Frank Drebin the dumb cop vying
for the love of Jane Spencer (Presley), and thats about all you can 
really say about it.  Plus, it's the worst FMV coding that I have ever 
seen.

@node patr "Patriot Games"

Stars    : Harrison Ford, Sean Bean, Patrick Bergin and Anne Archer
Director : Phillip Noyce
Cert     : 15
Length   : 112 Mins


        What begins as a holiday for the Ryan family in England abruptly 
ends when Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) becomes entangled in a lethal
terrorist action.  In successfully thwarting the incident, Ryan is faced 
with an even deadlier challenge - protecting himself and his family as 
they become the next target of this radical terrorist group.  From Tom 
Clancy, author of 'The Hunt For Red October'.

        Better plot than Clancy's other film, but sadly not executed 
quite as successfully onto celluloid by Noyce.  Disk one is very prone 
to jumping and synching problems, but then again, all of the good stuff 
is on disk 2 anyway!!

        Hmmmm, it's another Star Trek film, with much the same plot as 
all of the others.  Only for die hard fams of the genre, which, as you
have probably guessed, I am not.  Very good FMV encoding though!!

@node top "Top Gun"

Stars    : Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, and Val Kilmer
Director : Tony Scott
Cert     : 15
Length   : 105 Mins


        I'm sure that Top Gun needs no introduction, because I am sure 
that everyone in the world has probably seen it, and for that matter 
will have it on CD if they have FMV.  Mainly of course, for the reason 
that it was the first title available, but possibly, because it was by 
far the best of the first bunch of titles to be released.  The encoding 
is OK, but for reasons best attributed to the age of the film, whilst 
paused, the image is not as crystal clear as newer releases.  All things 
aside though, this is the one that will attract potential buyers.  Stick 
it in your machine, connect to a good Surround Sound system, pump up the 
volume and watch their faces.  It's great to see!!!

@node othe "Other Titles"

If you look carefully, there are two documentary/educational titles
available, released by Castle.  There is one concerned with Dinosaurs, 
and the other is purely on Planes.  Both are or reasonable quality, and 
if you are interested in the subject matter, they are a worthy buy.

Also of course, are the Music VCD's.  At the present time, the ones
available are :-

                Tina Turner  - Simply The Best
                Eric Clapton - Cream Of Clapton
                Eurythmics   - Greatest Hits
                Bon Jovi     - Keep The Faith
                Brian Adams  - Waking Up The Neighbours     and
                The Best Of Andrew Lloyd Webber (Premier Collection)

@node newa "New Company to Support Video CD"

        Orion Films (I thought that they were bust) have signed an 
agreement with Phillips to bring some of their back catalogue onto Video 
CD.  The first batch of titles should reach the UK in the next few 
months.  Definate releases so far are :-

                        Silence Of The Lambs
                        Dances With Wolves
                        Robocop
                        Mermaids
                        Bill And Ted's Bogus Journey
                        Married To The Mob
                        Mississippi Burning

Presumably Dances With Wolves will be on 3 or 4 disks!!!!  Expect 
reviews as soon as they are released!
