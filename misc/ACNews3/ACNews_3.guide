@{FG Shine}Welcome to @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 3rd issue of @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}.

Summer. Special time to rest. So, it's usual that nothing happens in Summer. But
this is not the case in the @{B}Amiga@{UB} world. And specially this year.

Since  @{B}Commodore@{UB}'s  bankruptcy,  we  have  seen  the  closures  of so many @{B}Amiga@{UB}
magazines:  @{B}Amiga  World@{UB},  @{B}Amiga User International@{UB}, @{B}Amiga Shopper@{UB}, @{B}Amiga Power@{UB},
only  to name a few of them. The usual reason of these closures were the lack of
advertizers and/or readers.

This  was  not  the  case  of  @{B}CU-Amiga@{UB}.  It is the best selling @{B}Amiga@{UB} magazine.
However, the October's issue will be the last of @{B}CU@{UB}.

I  remember  the first magazine I bought. It was the May's issue of @{B}CU-Amiga@{UB}, in
1990.  It  costed me 720 ptas (around 2.85£ at that time). It was mostly a games
magazine (it covered games as @{B}Their Finest Hour@{UB}, @{B}Persian Gulf Inferno@{UB} and @{B}Tennis
Cup@{UB}).  Since then, @{B}CU-Amiga@{UB} has evolved a lot, and its quality has been improved
a lot. I think it is (or was) the perfect magazine.

I  feel that this last issue will be something not to be missed. Here, in Spain,
it  is  not easy to find it, so I will try to contact the @{B}CU@{UB} staff, just in case
it is possible to buy it as a back issue. I heard that @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} will give them
an  exclusive  news  and  the CU-CD will feature something that needs the @{B}Sony@{UB}'s
permission.

Anyway,  this  is  not the end of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. We have @{B}Amiga Format@{UB}, the other big
magazine.  It  is  a  very  good  magazine, so I recommend all the @{B}CU@{UB} readers to
subscribe  @{B}Amiga Format@{UB}. In my case, I have just suscribed to the 3rd attempt to
do  a  spanish  @{B}Amiga@{UB} magazine. Its name: @{B}mundo Amiga@{UB}. If you speak Spanish, for
more information about this new magazine, visite

        @{B}http://soporte.databasedm.es/amiga/sau/noticias/980909_mundoami.html@{UB}

and then subscribe.

Talking  about  the  features of this issue, I apologize because it has not been
possible  to bring you the promised interview. And although this issue was going
to  have Football as the main topic, the soon-to-be-released @{B}Samba World Cup@{UB} and
@{B}Eat the Whistle@{UB} have made me to wait, so I expect to bring you a review of these
games in future issues.

Remember to visit the @{B}SAUG@{UB} website, which is located in:

        @{B}http://www.saug.com/sau/@{UB}

or you can visit its mirrors located in:

        @{B}http://soporte.databasedm.es/amiga/sau/@{UB}

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

        @{I}angel@saug.org @{UI}

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.

@{B}STFAX PROFESSIONAL V3.3@{UB} SUPPORTS @{I}INDEPENDENT OPERATION MODE@{UI}
-----------------------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

@{I}@{B}STFax Professional V3.3@{UB} supports Independent Operation Mode@{UI}

The  recently  released  @{B}STFax  Professional  v3.3@{UB}  now supports the @{I}Independent
Operation  Mode@{UI}  found  within  the  @{B}PACE  'Solo'@{UB}  (www.pacecom.co.uk) and @{B}3-Com
Message Plus@{UB} modems.

@{I}Independent  Operation  Mode@{UI} allows you to use the modem as a digital answer and
fax  machine  without  the need for your @{B}Amiga@{UB} to be switched on! The modem will
answer  with  a  greeting, the caller can leave a message as per a normal answer
machine and, if they are sending a fax, the modem will automatically switch into
fax mode and receive the fax transmission.

These voice and fax messages are then stored on the modem and, the next time you
run  your @{B}Amiga@{UB} and @{B}STFax Professional@{UB} (@{B}v3.3+@{UB}), these messages are automatically
downloaded  to  your  machine.  You  are then able to play/view/print/delete the
messages.

@{B}STFax  Professional@{UB}  supports  the  more  advanced  @{I}Independent  Operation  Mode@{UI}
features  only found within the @{B}PACE 'Solo'@{UB} modem. For instance you can remotely
retrieve  you  messages,  you can use the 'follow me' option to call you on your
mobile and play important messages and so on.

Please  note: that you need the @{B}PACE 'Solo'@{UB} or @{B}3-Com Message Plus@{UB} modem in order
to  use the independent support within @{B}STFax Professional v3.3+@{UB}. We currently do
not  support the @{B}Olitec 56K@{UB} or the new @{B}3-Com Professional Message Plus@{UB} modem. We
hope to add support for these modems in the future, within a new update.

@{I}@{B}NetConnect v2@{UB} Special Pre-Order Price Available@{UI}

The long awaited @{B}NetConnect v2@{UB} is due for release on the 21st of April 1998. You
can pre-order the new CD before release and save £10.

@{B}NetConnect  v2@{UB}  is  the  easiest  and  most  comprehensive  Internet compilation
designed  to enable any @{B}Amiga@{UB} user, from novice to expert level, to get onto and
use the Internet.

The  CD  is  based  around  eleven commercial programs, debuting @{B}AmiTCP-Genesis@{UB},
@{B}X-Arc@{UB},  @{B}Microdot-II  v1@{UB}  and  @{B}Vapor@{UB}'s new @{B}Contact Manager@{UB}. You are given all you
will  need to get the most from the Internet. By using the new @{B}Genesis Wizard@{UB}, a
user  should  be  able connect to the Internet in a matter of minutes. Ideal for
both  an  Internet and/or local area network connection (due to @{B}Genesis@{UB}' ability
to  support  multiple interface connections) and for an advanced or novice @{B}Amiga@{UB}
Internet user.

@{B}AMIGAZONE@{UB} DROPS ITS PRICE
-------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Sacramento, CA. USA
July 12, 1998

@{B}AmigaZone@{UB},  the online service for @{B}Amiga@{UB} owners and users, announces that it has
dropped its price to only $12.95 per month.

This  new  low  price  gets  you  full  24/7  access  to  all @{B}AmigaZone@{UB} features
including:
 * FIVE  different  ways to access the Zone! Members can use any or all of them,
   even simultaneously:
   1) Use any terminal program or telnet client and telnet to @{B}"amigazone.com"@{UB} to
      use  our  comfortable,  hotkey  driven, text-style BBS interface to access
      everything.
   2) Use  any  web  browser  and  surf  to  @{B}http://amigazone.com/@{UB}  to  use  our
      members-only Web interface to access everything.
   3) Connect  with  an  FTP  program or client to @{B}"amigazone.com"@{UB} to snag files
      from  our  huge  library of over 40,000 files, including tons of stuff you
      won't find on @{B}Aminet@{UB} or anywhere else!
   4) Connect your POP email client to @{B}"pop.amigazone.com"@{UB} to read and send mail
      to and from your own @{B}amigazone.com@{UB} address.
   5) For our members who own a @{I}Gates@{UI} Crate (@{B}Windoze@{UB} computer ;-) - download the
      free  @{B}"Wildcat  Navigator"@{UB} program which has multiple clients specifically
      designed  to  use  @{B}AmigaZone@{UB}'s  message  bases,  file  libraries,  CD  ROM
      collections,  live  chat  area, email, door games, and more. (@{B}WCNav@{UB} is NOT
      required to use @{B}AmigaZone@{UB}. It's merely an option for those of you who must
      or want to use a @{B}PeeCee@{UB} to log in)
 * @{B}AmigaZone@{UB}  has  dozens  of message areas including our own local areas, @{B}Amiga@{UB}
   Usenet  newsgroup  feeds,  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  Fidonet  "echo"  feeds,  and  over  a dozen
   @{B}Amiga@{UB}-specific  mailing  lists fed into their own message bases, each holding
   weeks  or  months of postings. Use our insanely fast search functions to find
   what  you're  after  in  over  30,000 articles, online at all times, with new
   stuff feeding in 24 hours a day.

 * Our  file  library  is absolutely enormous - over 40,000 files online all the
   time, and thousands more on our multiple CD changer.

 * We have friendly, live, interactive chats seven nights a week, and the Sunday
   chat always features at least two prize contests, open to all members - we've
   given  away  thousands  of  buck$  worth  of  @{B}Amiga@{UB} goods - it's an @{B}AmigaZone@{UB}
   tradition.

$12.95 a month gets you ALL of this - there are NO extra cost or optional areas.
Our  web  inteface has NO annoying, ram-eating, time-wasting banner ads. You pay
for @{B}Amiga@{UB} news, information, entertainment and files and that's exactly what you
get.

And  you  can log in from anywhere in the world. All you need is an account with
any  local  Internet  Service Provider (ISP), and any terminal program or telnet
client, or any browser.

@{I}@{B}"AmigaZone Plus"@{UB} option:@{UI}

You  can  also  choose  to bundle @{B}AmigaZone@{UB} with a full @{B}CalWeb@{UB} Internet Services
@{B}UNIX@{UB}  shell  account  too  -  this  @{B}"AmigaZone  Plus"@{UB}  package gets you the full
@{B}AmigaZone@{UB} account PLUS the @{B}CalWeb UNIX@{UB} shell, including all the usual @{B}UNIX@{UB} shell
tools  (news, mail, etc.) plus 10 meg of free online storage and web hosting for
your own personal web site. @{B}AmigaZone Plus@{UB} is $19.95 per month. Again, no hidden
costs.

To  sign up for @{B}AmigaZone@{UB} or @{B}AmigaZone Plus@{UB}, just visit @{B}http://www.amigazone.com@{UB}
and  click on the very obvious "JOIN NOW!" link or image near the top. This will
transport  you  to  our  secure signup page (SSL required - works with all @{B}Amiga@{UB}
browsers).

You'll  have  your account within one or two working days and then you can enjoy
all the features and benefits of being an @{B}AmigaZone@{UB} member.

@{B}AmigaZone@{UB},  founded  in  1985,  is  run  by @{I}Harv Laser@{UI}, well-known @{B}Amiga@{UB} writer,

@{B}AMIGA ENERGY@{UB} MAGAZINE ANNOUNCES PROMOTIONS
------------------------------------------

@{I}@{B}AMIGA ENERGY@{UB} PRESS RELEASE@{UI}

After  its  successful  launch  in  May  of  this year, @{B}Amiga Energy@{UB}, the new UK
published @{B}Amiga@{UB} fanzine from @{B}Infinite Frontiers@{UB}, is pleased to announce a number
of new developments that have taken place recently with the magazine.

@{I}Free Gifts@{UI}

Thanks to the generosity of @{B}Amiga International@{UB}, we have been able to offer free
gifts  with  the first two issues of @{B}Amiga Energy@{UB}. Issue 1, released in May 1998
(back  issues  are  still  available),  shipped  with  a free @{I}"powered by @{B}Amiga@{UB}"@{UI}
sticker. Following that up, we have a limited supply of the new @{I}@{B}Amiga@{UB} Boing Ball@{UI}
stickers that were to be seen at the @{B}World Of Amiga@{UB} Show and we are making these
available to the first 200 people who place an order for Issue 2 of the magazine
which is due for release at the end of July.

@{I}User Group Discounts@{UI}

Following  the example set by @{B}Amiga International@{UB} in providing support for @{B}Amiga@{UB}
user  groups  everywhere,  @{B}Amiga  Energy@{UB} is now available to any interested user
group  at  a discount rate for bulk purchases of 10 copies or more. The generous
discounts  (with  free postage and packing) allow user groups to either pass the
discount  on  to  their  members, or to sell the magazines at the standard cover
price,  raising  valuable  funds for the user groups. For more information and a
price breakdown, see the ordering section on our web site.

@{I}Subscription Offer@{UI}

@{B}Infinite Frontiers@{UB}, publishers of @{B}Amiga Energy@{UB}, don't just produce @{B}Amiga Energy@{UB}.
We  have  been involved in producing fan magazines for almost 10 years, the most
well  known being the @{B}Star Trek Amiga@{UB} disk magazine @{B}The Final Frontier@{UB}. This has
also been available in a paper format (retitled @{B}The Final Frontier Phase II@{UB}) for
just  over  a  year in a similar style to @{B}Amiga Energy@{UB} and as a special offer to
introduce  new  subscribers  to our our work, we are offering a free copy of the
latest issue of @{B}The Final Frontier Phase II@{UB} released 15th July 1998 (worth £1.75
including  postage) to anyone taking out a 6 issue subscription with coverdisks,
between  now  and the end of August 1998. The free fanzine will be sent out with
the  first  issue  of your subscription, which you can start at ANY issue of the
magazine,  so  if  you've  never  tried  @{B}Amiga  Energy@{UB},  you  could  start  your
subscription  with  Issue  1,  get  six  issues,  and still qualify for the free
fanzine.  Don't  forget to mention this offer when you write! For information on
the  subscription rates, and the address where to send payment, see the @{B}Infinite
Frontiers@{UB} web site.

@{I}Overseas Orders@{UI}

Although  @{B}Infinite  Frontiers@{UB}  is  a  non-profit  making UK organisation, we can
accept  orders  for our magazines from outside the UK. While we would prefer not
to,  we  can  accept  UK cash for any orders and we can now accept International
Money  Orders in US Dollars for 6-issue subscriptions. Finally, for those of you
in  the  US or Canada, or who can get US currency easily, we can accept US$ cash
payments  for  single  issues (we can only accept cash hoping that enough orders
come  in  for  us to afford the exchange rates allowing us to charge just $5 per
issue).  Naturally,  cash is sent at your own risk, but at least many of you can
now  order  our  magazines  who  could  not  a while ago. For details on all the
overseas rates, see the web site.

@{I}Online Adverts@{UI}

As part of our continued commitment to offering a better service to our readers,
as  part of our web site we are now running an extensive free online advertising
service.  Any  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  owner  can  advertise  anything that they want to sell, or
advertise  for products that they are looking to buy. A selection of adverts are
currently  online,  with  more  being added on a regular basis. In addition, the
site  offers  a  selection  of  areas  featuring  non-@{B}Amiga@{UB}  related adverts for
Sci-Fi/Fantasy enthusiasts, console owners, and much more.

@{I}Issue 2 Release Date@{UI}

Issue 2 of @{B}Amiga Energy@{UB} is due for release at the end of July with a full report
on  the 1998 World of Amiga Show, reviews of @{B}Quake@{UB}, @{B}Genetic Species@{UB}, @{B}Sixth Sense
Investigations@{UB}  and  much more. The 48-page magazine will once again ship in two
versions  -  one  with  and  one without a coverdisk, packed with assorted @{B}Amiga@{UB}
software. Details of some of the contents can be found on our web site.

Yes that's right - @{B}Putty Squad@{UB} is finally going to be released courtesy of @{B}Alive

This little platform game caused quite a stir in the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community when it was
dropped by its creators upon completion of the game.

get it released....well, their waiting is over!

@{B}AMIGASOC@{UB} UK USER GROUP PLANS TRIP TO COLOGNE SHOW
-------------------------------------------------

@{B}AmigaSoc@{UB} does @{B}Cologne II@{UB}: This time it's personal

@{B}AmigaSoc@{UB} is organising a trip to Cologne for @{B}Computer 98@{UB}. We'd therefore like to
extend an invitation to all @{B}Amiga@{UB}ns in the UK to come along. We're aiming to try
and  offer  a  cut-price  trip (including accomodation, where possible, but on a
first  come,  first  served  basis). Presently we're only able to deal with user
groups (and also developers/retailers) primarily for convenience ... but also to
encourage people to join their local user group.

Our  choice for accomodation is the @{B}Hotel Berg@{UB} (@{B}http://www.hotel-berg.com/@{UB}), who
are  offering  quite  an  aggressive  discount  for  groups. If you wish to stay
somewhere  else,  you'll have to organise that yourself (but by all means, we're
happy  to  include you in the flights). For other hotels in Cologne, have a look
at  @{B}www.cologne-hotels.com@{UB}.  Our  chosen airline is @{B}British Midland@{UB} who are also
offering some good deals for groups, although @{B}Eurostar@{UB} is also a possibility.

In  total,  people can expect to pay less than 200 pounds for the flight and the
accomodation.  The  accomodation  only  includes  bed  and  (a  fairly  minimal)
breakfast.

We  will  require  people  to  pay  up front in order to book the flight and the
accomodation.  Naturally,  @{B}AmigaSoc@{UB}  will  not  make any money from this. We are
purely  interested  in encouraging as many people from the UK to come to Cologne
this year as possible.

@{B}AmigaSoc@{UB}  visited  Cologne  for  the first time last year, and we firmly believe
that  if this show is anything like that, you'll be kicking yourself if you miss
it.  Imagine  a  show  like  the  generic computer shows that used to be held in
Earl's  Court  in  the  80s. Imagine a show where 70% of those stands have @{B}Amiga@{UB}
stuff  in  there.  Plus,  we  at  @{B}AmigaSoc@{UB}  certainly don't want to miss any big
announcements.

We  require  all  payments  and  bookings  to  reach  us  no later than the 20th
September 1998.

@node not18 "GOODBYE CU AMIGA, GOODBYE"

GOODBYE @{B}CU AMIGA@{UB}, GOODBYE
-------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

It is with great regret that I have to inform you that the October 1998 issue of
@{B}CU Amiga@{UB} will be the last ever published. @{B}CU Amiga Magazine@{UB} recently dipped into
a  state  of  unprofitability,  from  which  it  looked  unlikely to emerge. The
decision  to  close  the  magazine  was taken by @{B}EMAP@{UB} in light of the magazine's
overall  financial  performance  and  the lack of prospects for any immediate or
short term recovery.

It  is  ironic  that  @{B}CU  Amiga@{UB}  should  close as the world's best selling @{B}Amiga@{UB}
magazine,  but  recently  its  financial  returns  have  started to outweigh its
overheads. While it has been customary for costs to be cut in order to stave off
the  closure  of  magazines,  it was decided that @{B}CU Amiga@{UB} would be laid to rest
without  suffering  the  indignities  of  having  half its pages removed and the
remaineder  printed  on toilet paper in black and white. Neither will it be sold
off to another company to be published on a shoe string and run into the ground.

The @{B}CU Amiga@{UB} editorial team were obviously very sorry to hear the news and would
like  to  pass  on their sincere thanks to everyone who has helped make @{B}CU Amiga@{UB}
such a success and so much fun to work on over its many years of existence.

@{I}Tony Horgan@{UI}
Editor, @{B}CU Amiga Magazine@{UB}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{I}@{B}CU Amiga@{UB} Closure FAQ@{UI}

@{I}Q: Why is @{B}CU Amiga@{UB} closing?@{UI}
A:  Because  it is no longer making a profit and therefore cannot continue to be
published.

@{I}Q:  How can the best selling @{B}Amiga@{UB} magazine not make a profit when other smaller
magazines manage to do it?@{UI}
A:  Smaller  magazines  have  different  publishing set-ups, different costs and
different  distribution channels. Many are run at a slight loss or at break-even
by  dedicated  people  as  extended  hobbies.  @{B}CU  Amiga@{UB} is published by a major
magazine publishing company (@{B}EMAP@{UB}), and as a Publicly Limited Company (PLC) @{B}EMAP@{UB}
must  show its shareholders that it is making their money work, which means they
cannot  publish  magazines  that  make  a  loss.  @{B}EMAP@{UB} are a multi billion pound
international corporation; they have stuck with the @{B}Amiga@{UB} as long as they could.
Much smaller firms left years ago claiming the market was too small for them.

@{I}Q: Why are costs not cut in order to save the magazine?@{UI}
A:  That's  not  what @{B}CU Amiga@{UB} is about. We have always tried to make @{B}CU Amiga@{UB} a
watchword  for quality. The editorial staff and our publishers feel it is better
to leave on a high note than continually reduce the size of the magazine, remove
the  disks, reduce staff and investment in the title to keep it going regardless
of quality.

@{I}Q: Surely though something can be done?@{UI}
A:  We  could  reduce  the  magazine  to  a low quality pamphlet that was poorly
researched and written but then it wouldn't be worth the £4.50/£5.99 cover price.

@{I}Q: Why don't the staff all take a pay cut?@{UI}
A: Would you? And where would it end?

@{I}Q: Why have you lead us to believe the magazine would not close?@{UI}
A:  We  have always been honest and said that there would come a time (if things
did  not  pick  up) when the magazine would no longer be profitable. No-one knew
when  that  time  would be. We have been making money until very recently - this
has turned out to be one summer lull too much for us.

@{I}Q: Is this a plot to get @{B}Amiga@{UB} users to buy @{B}PC@{UB}s?@{UI}
A: No. @{B}CU Amiga@{UB}'s publisher has no @{B}PC@{UB} magazines anyway.

@{I}Q: Will @{B}"CU Amiga"@{UB} be turned into @{B}"CU PC"@{UB}?@{UI}
A: No.

@{I}Q: I have a subscription. What happens now?@{UI}
A: You will be refunded for the outstanding issues. Follow this link for details.

@{I}Q: Why isn't the magazine sold to a publisher who can make a profit from it?@{UI}
A:  Sacrifices  would have to be made by any pubilsher that would compromise the
magazine  so  that  it  would no longer be the @{B}CU Amiga@{UB} you currently know. @{B}EMAP@{UB}
have made the decision that they want to close @{B}CU@{UB} on a high rather than sell the
name on to let another publisher exploit.

@{I}Q: Will @{B}CU Amiga@{UB} return when the new Super @{B}Amiga@{UB} is released?@{UI}
A:  We  hope so, although we cannot make any promises on that one. That decision
will be in the hands of our (ex) publisher (@{B}EMAP@{UB}).

@{I}Q:  Can  I  take  this opportunity to thank the team for their dedication to the
magazine and the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community?@{UI}
A: Of course you can. Thank you.

@{I}Q: And what about us?@{UI}
A:  Well,  there's always @{B}Amiga Format@{UB} (as far as we know at this point anyway).
@{I}Nick@{UI}  and @{I}Ben@{UI} will look after you. We really are very sorry to have to leave you
like  this.  We  would  all  love to go on working on the magazine well into the
future  but  it's just not possible. One way or another we'll be around when the
Super  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  surfaces,  even though it most likely won't be a Class of 98 style
reunion of the whole team under the old banner.

@{I}Q: So is it time to pack the @{B}Amiga@{UB} away for good?@{UI}
A:  No! Keep on keeping on and we'll see you soon in happier times. We have been
a  point  of  contact  for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community, but we are not the @{B}Amiga@{UB}, just a
magazine  about  it.  New products will go on being available, and your old ones
will work just as well without @{B}CU Amiga@{UB} in the newsagents.

@{I}Q: How do I contact you about anything?@{UI}
A:  Please  do not email any of our personal mail accounts with your comments or
queries.  We anticipate a lot of mail coming in over this, and we still have one
more  issue  to  produce - flooding our mailboxes will make this harder. You can
send us email on @{I}goodbye@cu-amiga.co.uk@{UI} - we will welcome your comments and will
be printing a selection of them in the last (October cover dated) issue.

The @{I}general@cu-amiga.co.uk@{UI} address and the @{I}goodbye@cu-amiga.co.uk@{UI} addresses will
remain  for  a  little  while  yet,  and  while we cannot promise answers in the
future,  someone  will  be  looking  in  on those accounts. Obviously our normal
section  related mail (Q&A, backchat) will not be dealt with any more. Please do
not mail us with technical queries in the future, there will be no-one to answer
them.

WILL @{B}WIPEOUT 2097@{UB} AND @{B}TOMB RAIDER@{UB} PORTED TO THE @{B}AMIGA@{UB}?
------------------------------------------------------

@{B}Statement from Digital Images.@{UB}

@{B}Digital Images@{UB} is a new games and software development company for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. We
aim  to  make  things  different  and  better  for  the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. We have our first
original  strategy  business  sim on the way, @{B}Space Station 3000@{UB}. After that, we
intend  to  convert  some  of the @{B}PC@{UB}'s finest games to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. The first 2 of
which  are @{B}Wipeout 2097@{UB} which is a brilliant 3D racing game for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} set in
the  future.  The  other  one  is  @{B}Tomb  Raider  3@{UB}. @{B}Tomb Raider 3@{UB} isn't actually
released  yet,  but  we think that @{B}Amiga@{UB} owners should enjoy this fabalous game.
The main problem is, the companies that own the rights to these games need to be
shown  that  there  is  still a market for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}, and within 18 months, that
market will start returning to a good strength.

The  reason @{B}Myst@{UB} and @{B}Quake@{UB} were ported to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} was because of hassling from
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  owners.  @{B}ID  Software@{UB}  (The  copyright  owners  of  @{B}Quake@{UB})  and @{B}Cyan@{UB} (The
copyright  owners  of  @{B}Myst@{UB})  thought  that the @{B}Amiga@{UB} died out at the end of the
@{B}Commodore@{UB}  era. That is, until illegal demo's of both of these games appeared on
the  internet.  These  demo's soon got deleted from the internet after came from
both  of  the companies. But, the @{B}Amiga@{UB} owners who had seen them wanted the real
thing.  They  hassled  @{B}Cyan@{UB}  for  @{B}Myst@{UB} and @{B}ID@{UB} for @{B}Quake@{UB}. This is where @{B}ClickBOOM@{UB}
stepped in and bought the licencing.

What  I'm  trying  to  say  is,  that  you,  as @{B}Amiga@{UB} users need to hassle these
companies for these games. Only then, can we hope to succeed.

We  would like you to hassle @{B}Psygnosis@{UB} for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} release of @{B}Wipeout 2097@{UB} and
we want you to hassle @{B}EIDOS@{UB} for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} release of @{B}Tomb Raider 3@{UB}.

The  technology  of  the  game  makes it possible to play with a nearly infinite
number   of   players   within   the  world  named  "Tamar"  controlled  by  the
@{B}ETERNITY@{UB}-Server.  You  may  fight  against the computer as well as against other
players.   The   game   is  fully  compatible  to  the  @{B}PC@{UB}-Version.  Like  other
Fantasy-Worlds  "Tamar"  knows other races like orks and elves. The player takes
controll  over  his  own  realm and has to make it big, strong and wealthy. It`s
possible  to make a progression on to emperor. Other races will be played by the
computer.

Further  information  about  our  game  you  will  find  on  our  new  homepage:
@{B}http://eternity.amiga-software.com/@{UB}

Please  do  not  hesitate to contact us for further Interviews and questions. We
are  always  looking for good Graphic-designers and Musicians as freelancers. If

@{B}SOFTSYNTH@{UB} ANNOUNCES @{B}JFORTH@{UB} RELEASED AS FREEWARE
-----------------------------------------------

@{I}Press Release@{UI} - 21:00 Hrs. Monday 10th August 1998

May the @{B}Forth@{UB} be with you...Always !!!

Upgraded to @{B}OS3.1@{UB}

With  great  thanks  to  the  primary  authors, @{I}Mike Haas@{UI} and @{I}Phil Burk@{UI} who have
magnanimously  decided  to  release  this  product  (formerly priced at $179) as
freeware, the @{B}Amiga@{UB} now has another "arrow in it's quiver".

***** NOTE  -  Print  out  the  excellent  manual.  Not  only  does  it give you
      invaluable  information  on  the many tools provided, but there is also an
      excellent 3-stage tutorial *****

***** Join   the   @{B}JForth@{UB}   mailing   list  !!!  to  subscribe  send  e-mail  to
      @{I}MDaemon@ChaosSolutions.com@{UI}  with @{I}subscribe @{B}JForth@{UB}-list@{UI} as the only line in
      the body *****

@{I}What is it ?@{UI}

@{B}JForth@{UB}  is  a  programming language that allows you to interact with your @{B}Amiga@{UB}.
When  you  are  programming  in  @{B}JForth@{UB},  you are "inside" the language. You can
access  any data structure, test any routine, or use any development tool, right
from  the keyboard. This direct communication with the computer can improve your
productivity, giving you additional time to improve the quality of your software
products.

@{B}JForth@{UB}  is  based on the 1983 standard @{B}Forth@{UB} language. @{B}Forth@{UB} was first conceived
by  @{I}Charles  Moore@{UI}  when he wanted a new language for controlling telescopes. He
developed  a  language  based  on  a dictionary of words. This dictionary can be
extended  by writing new words based on the old ones. Since Mr. @{I}Moore@{UI}'s original
version,  @{B}Forth@{UB}  has  been  translated to almost every type of computer from the
biggest mainframes to the smallest microcomputers.

Since  a  minimal  @{B}Forth@{UB}  system  can  be implemented in just a few kilobytes of
memory,  it  is  often  used in very small embedded computer systems for process
control  and  robotics.  @{B}Forth@{UB}, however, is equally appropriate for larger, more
advanced, computers like the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. @{B}Forth@{UB} is a very flexible language and can be
adapted  to larger computers without losing the flavor of the original language.
@{B}JForth@{UB}  is  an  implementation  of @{B}Forth@{UB} designed specifically for the @{B}Commodore
Amiga@{UB}.  @{B}JForth@{UB}  uses a 32-bit stack and compiles directly to @{B}68000@{UB} machine code.
This makes @{B}JForth@{UB} faster than most @{B}Forth@{UB}s.

@{B}JForth@{UB}  also  provides  an  extensive  set  of  tools  for accessing the special
features  of  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}.  You  can  call  any @{B}Amiga@{UB} Library routine by name and
reference  any  @{B}Amiga@{UB} structure using constructs similar to @{B}'C'@{UB}. @{B}JForth@{UB} also has
some special toolboxes that support simple graphics, @{B}Intuition@{UB} menus, @{B}IFF@{UB} files,
and  other @{B}Amiga@{UB} features. These toolboxes can be used directly to simplify your
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  programming.  Source  code for all these toolboxes is provided so you can
customize  them if needed or study them as examples of @{B}Amiga@{UB} programming. @{B}JForth@{UB}
also  provides  over a dozen small sample programs for those, like me, who learn
best  by  example.  @{B}JForth@{UB}  also  allows you to do things that are unique in the
@{B}Forth@{UB} experience, the most dramatic being @{I}CLONE@{UI}. This exceptional utility allows
you  to  create  a  totally  independent,  standalone version of your program of
minimal size.

@{I}@{B}Amiga@{UB}  Library  Calls@{UI}  -  @{B}JForth@{UB}  provides a system for easily calling any @{B}Amiga@{UB}
Library  routine by name. It will figure out what @{B}68000@{UB} registers the parameters
go  into  and build the appropriate code. Thus you can simply pass parameters on
the  stack  in  the  order  described  in  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB} documentation. A number of
toolboxes  have  been written for supporting specific parts of the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Library
including @{B}EZMENUS@{UB}, Graphics, the Serial Device, @{B}ANSI@{UB} codes, and much more.

@{I}@{B}Amiga@{UB}  Structure  Support@{UI}  -  @{B}JForth@{UB}  provides the equivalent to all of the ".h"
include  files from @{B}'C'@{UB}. These ".j" files define all of the necessary structures
and  constants for passing information to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Library routines. Structures
can  be  dumped  interactively  with  all  members  shown  by name and value for
debugging by using @{B}DST@{UB}. Upgraded to @{B}OS3.1@{UB} !

@{I}@{B}ARexx@{UB}  Support@{UI} - @{B}ARexx@{UB} is a language that helps various applications communicate
with  each  other. A spread sheet program, for example, could communicate with a
data base program. These tools help you write @{B}ARexx@{UB} compatible programs.

@{I}@{B}Assembler@{UB}@{UI}  -  @{B}JForth@{UB}  support  two  @{B}68000@{UB}  assemblers,  one  with @{B}Reverse Polish
Notation@{UB}  (@{B}RPN@{UB}) and one with @{B}Motorola@{UB} like syntax. The @{B}RPN@{UB} assembler can be used
to  create  macros but the @{B}Motorola@{UB} assembler is easier to read. There is also a
Disassembler.

@{I}Block Support and @{B}SCRED@{UB}@{UI} - For those who prefer the old fashioned BLOCK or SCREEN
environment, we provide LIST, LOAD and the standard line editor. We also provide
a WYSIWYG SCREEN editor called @{B}SCRED@{UB}. (We recommend the use of normal text files
with @{B}JForth@{UB}).

@{I}Clone@{UI}  -  @{I}Clone@{UI}  can be used to generate small, executable images of your @{B}JForth@{UB}
programs. @{I}Clone@{UI} will take a compiled @{B}JForth@{UB} program, extract out all of the code
and  data  needed to run it, and re-assemble a smaller version of it. All of the
@{B}JForth@{UB}  development  tools, the name fields and link fields and any other unused
words  are  left  behind.  The  final image size is comparable to images created
using a @{B}'C'@{UB} compiler and linker. Images can be saved with a symbol table for use
with  @{B}WACK@{UB}  or other debuggers (if needed). The @{B}JForth Source Level Debugger@{UB} can
also be used with @{I}Cloned@{UI} programs. Most programs will @{I}Clone@{UI} without modification
if they follow a few simple rules regarding run time initialization of variables
or arrays containing @{B}Forth@{UB} addresses.

@{I}Debugger@{UI}  -  @{B}JForth@{UB}  provides  a source level debugger that allows you to single
step  through your code. At every step you can see what is on the stack. You can
also  examine the return stack, dump memory, set breakpoints, control execution,
or even enter Forth commands.

@{I}Floating  Point@{UI}  -  @{B}JForth@{UB} support both the single precision Fast Floating Point
and  the  @{B}IEEE@{UB}  double precision. These words conform to the @{B}Forth Vendors Group
Standard@{UB}.

@{I}@{B}IFF@{UB}  Support@{UI} - @{B}JForth@{UB} provides general purpose tools for reading and writing @{B}IFF@{UB}
files.  It  also  provides  a toolbox specifically for @{B}ILBM@{UB} graphics files. This
allows you to use pictures, brushes, anims and animbrushes from a paint program,
or  other source, in your programs. @{B}JForth@{UB} also provides tools for animation and
presentation  such as, blit, wipe, fade in, fade out, etc. Powerful graphics and
animation programs can be created using these tools.

@{I}Local  Variables@{UI}  - Local variables can simplify the definition of complex words
by  eliminating  much  of  the stack manipulation. Local variables are fast self
fetching  variables  that  allow  reentrant  recursive code to be written. Using
regular VARIABLEs can make a word non reentrant.

@{I}Modules@{UI}  -  @{B}JForth@{UB}'s  precompiled modules provide a method for rapidly accessing
code  that  is  used  during  compilation.  This  includes  the  Assemblers  and
Disassembler,  and the @{B}Amiga@{UB} include files. These modules are dynamically linked
into  the  dictionary  when  needed. This way, they do not take up space in your
normal dictionary, yet are instantly available.

@{I}Multi-Standard@{UI}  - This system allows you to switch easily between @{B}JForth@{UB} and the
major  standards - FIG , '79 , and '83. This is handy for compiling code written
using other Forths. An @{B}ANSI@{UB} compatable module is being worked on.

@{I}@{B}ODE@{UB}@{UI}  -  @{B}ODE@{UB}  is an Object Oriented Development Environment similar in concept to
@{B}SmallTalk@{UB}.  It allows you to define classes of intelligent data structures, then
create  as  many  copies  of these data structures as needed. This technique can
simplify programming immensely by making it easier to write reusable code.

@{I}Profiler@{UI}  -  This  optimization tool monitors the operation of a program to find
out  where  it is spending its time. Most programs spend most of their time in a
small  portion  of  the code. By identifying this code, one can focus efforts at
optimization where they are most needed.

@{I}@{B}Textra@{UB}@{UI}  -  @{B}Textra@{UB}  is  a  powerful,  yet  easy  to use, multi-window text editor
designed  for programmers. It uses the mouse to select text and allows Cut, Copy
and Paste, operations between its windows. It also incorporates @{B}ARexx@{UB} hooks that
allows  you to use provided macros (.textra files) for text processing (or write
your own). @{B}Textra@{UB} can communicate with @{B}JForth@{UB} such that you can compile directly
from  the  editor.  If  an  error  is  encountered  while compiling, @{B}Textra@{UB} will
highlight the error so then you can fix it quickly.

@{I}Tutorials@{UI}  -  Beginner, intermediate and advanced guiding you through the basics
of the system.

@{I}Miscellaneous debugger tools@{UI} - Show hunks for analyzing @{B}Amiga@{UB} binary files

Graphics toolkits

Anims and animbrushes

invaluable  information  on  the  many  tools  provided,  but  there  is also an
excellent 3-stage tutorial

6,000  square  metres!  The access price comes to 250 Bfr. (14 Fl./5 £/13 DM) or
200 Bfr. (11 Fl./4 £/10 DM) for big groups.

You  may  expect companies, shops, organisations, user groups and many important
notables  from  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB} world; some of them will give one or more seminaries.
During  those two days live IRC conferences will be held and we're also planning
to  set  up some web cams. People who would like to experiment with the Internet
can  visit  our  cyberzone  and the ideal place for a break is of course our big
bar!  @{B}ANNEX@{UB}  will  perform their latest dance acts and @{B}AMIGA International, Inc.@{UB}
will  have  a  big booth to offer you all the latest news! The @{B}UGN@{UB} stand will be
available too for all kind of user group information.

On our web pages you can find many more information about this huge @{B}Amiga@{UB} event:
general  info,  the temporary list of exhibitors, hotel info, pictures from last
year,  a  floorplan,  travel  information  (don't  forget  to take a look at our
roadmap),  details  about the IRC conferences, the seminaries, etc. Just surf to
@{B}http://titan.glo.be/~waasland/infomedia98@{UB} and have a look! Also look out for our
advertisements in many @{B}Amiga@{UB} magazines.

We  are  planning  special  bus trips to this fair from The Netherlands, France,
Germany,...  (visit  our  website  for more info), so it may not be a problem to
come over and attend those two magical days...!

August 15th, 1998

Subject:  @{B}AmiCON@{UB}  announces  new  partnerships,  a redesigned web site, and show
floor expansion for the @{B}1998 Midwest Amiga Exposition@{UB}.

From: @{B}The Amiga Central Ohio Network@{UB}
       @{I}Dave Pearce@{UI} - @{I}dpearce@amicon.org@{UI}
       @{I}Ronn Black@{UI} - @{I}rblack@amicon.org@{UI}

@{B}AmiCON@{UB}  is  proud  to announce the formation of several key partnerships for the
@{B}1998 Midwest Amiga Expo@{UB} with @{B}Pantheon Systems@{UB}, the @{B}User Group Network@{UB} (@{B}UGN@{UB}), the
@{B}ICOA@{UB},  and  the  @{B}Champaign-Urbana Computer Users Group@{UB} (@{B}Amiga Web Directory@{UB}). In
conjunction  with  @{B}Pantheon  Systems@{UB},  the  Expo will have World Wide Web access
direct  from  the show floor via specialized @{B}Amiga@{UB} kiosk machines. Four stations
will  be  positioned around the show floor with on-line access to the WWW during
the  entire duration of the event. The @{B}UGN@{UB} will be providing live IRC and webcam
services during the event, and the @{B}ICOA@{UB} has agreed to supervise the seminars and
classes  offered  at  this years show. The @{B}Champaign-Urbana Computer Users Group@{UB}
will be holding a raffle during the Expo for an @{B}Amiga 4000 Video Toaster@{UB} system.
Tickets  will be sold during both days of the show floor with the drawing taking
place  on Sunday. @{B}CUCUG@{UB} members attending our show will receive a discount price
of  $5.00  for  single  day admission and $8.00 for a two day pass. Members must
present  their  @{B}CUCUG@{UB} membership ID at the door in order to receive the discount

Also,  in  conjunction  with  @{B}Pantheon Systems@{UB}, the @{B}Midwest Amiga Exposition@{UB} web

Potential exhibitors can register on-line to reserve space, and schedule a class
or  seminar.  The  complete seminar schedule allowing on-line signup for classes
will be posted shortly.

@{B}AmiCON@{UB}  has increased show floor for the @{B}1998 Midwest Amiga Expo@{UB} to 8,500 square
feet,  almost  triple  that  of  last  years  event!  Rental space will not last
forever, so please make your reservations soon! Expansion was necessary in order
to  better serve the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community with as many @{B}Amiga@{UB} vendors under on roof as
possible.

In following with the tradition of bringing the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community closer together,
the  @{B}Amiga  Central  Ohio  Network@{UB}  is offering a 20% discount to user groups on
space  rental  for  exhibiting  at  the @{B}98 MAE@{UB}. As in years past, the @{B}98 MAE@{UB} was
formed  specifically  with  the financial considerations of @{B}Amiga@{UB} user groups in
mind.  This is an excellent opportunity for user groups to make extra income and
enjoy  the  atmosphere  of one of the best @{B}Amiga@{UB} events around at an inexpensive
rate!  Don't  miss out on your chance to help the local @{B}Amiga@{UB} organizations grow
and expand!

Along with the most prominent @{B}Amiga@{UB} companies and seminars, the @{B}98 Midwest Amiga
Expo@{UB} also offers special events for attendees such as the @{B}Special Interest Group
Gatherings@{UB}  (@{B}SIGGs@{UB}). The @{B}SIGGs@{UB} will take place on Saturday night, after the show
floor  closes,  at  one  of  the  premier hot spots in Columbus, Jillians, right
across the street from the show. The @{B}SIGGs@{UB} will consist of groups like Graphics,
Internet  and  others  headed  by  industry leaders who will meet to discuss the
latest  topics among good food, drinks, and fantastic atmosphere. Take advantage
of  this  opportunity  to discuss the latest trends, rumors, and developments in
the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  community. Signups for the @{B}SIGGs@{UB} will be available during the day at
the Expo.

The @{B}1998 Midwest Amiga Exposition@{UB} is being held at the world-class Hyatt Regency
hotel  at  The Greater Columbus Convention Center, on October 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.
Tickets  for  the event are $8.00 for a single day pass and $12.00 for a two day

@{B}JFORTH@{UB} WEB SITE BURSTS FORTH
----------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Following  the  exciting  release of @{B}JForth@{UB} freeware on the 10th August 1998, we
are  now  proud  to  announce  the  availability  of  the  @{B}JForth@{UB}  web  site  at
@{B}http://home.tampabay.rr.com/jforth/@{UB}.

This site is under-going continuous daily updating !

In the 21-days since the @{B}JForth@{UB} release (10th August 1998), the primary download
site  at  @{B}http://www.softsynth.com/jforth/@{UB}  has had 931 downloads of @{B}JForth@{UB}. The
temporary  ftp  site  at @{B}ftp.calweb@{UB} did not have tracking information and is now
closed.  The unknowns are the @{B}calweb@{UB} site and duplicates people have made so the
actual number is probably a lot higher.

Due  to  problems  with @{B}Rich Text Formatting@{UB} (@{B}RTF@{UB}) compatibility issues, we have
re-assessed the situation. The result is the @{B}JForth Documentation Project@{UB} (@{B}JDP@{UB}).

It's  first  success  is  the release of the major sections of the @{B}JForth@{UB} manual
on-line (see web page) in HTML format (the Glossary will be completed this week).

More conversions of the @{B}JForth@{UB} manual will follow during the month of September.

In   addition  to  the  general  mailing  list  @{I}MDaemon@ChaosSolutions.com@{UI}  with
@{I}'subscribe  @{B}JForth@{UB}-list'@{UI}  as  the only line in the body, an announcement mailing
list has been created.

This  is  for people who don't have time to start @{B}JForth@{UB} at the moment, but want
to  be  kept  informed  of  Press Releases and other major @{B}JForth@{UB} announcements.
Please NOTE:- This list is for announcements only. You CANNOT post to this list!

To   join,   send   a   mail   to   @{I}MDaemon@ChaosSolutions.com@{UI}  with  @{I}'subscribe

Many  projects are presently being formed and new developments and announcements
are expected shortly.

Louis.  They  met  with  @{I}Steve  Folberg@{UI},  president  of  the @{B}Central Texas Amiga

an  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  show for the benefit of all Texas and regional @{B}Amiga@{UB} users. Since the

@{B}NATIONAL AMIGA@{UB} ANNOUNCES WORLD WIDE @{B}AMIGA@{UB} DEALERS LIST
------------------------------------------------------

Contact: @{I}Greg Scott@{UI} (@{I}gscott@nationalamiga.com@{UI})

We  are  setting  up  a  list  targeting @{B}Amiga@{UB} dealers around the world. Not for
personal  gain,  but  for  a  co-ordinated  effort  to  discuss and agree upon a
presentation  of  facts  to  give  to  those  in charge of @{B}Amiga Incorporated@{UB} at
@{B}Gateway@{UB}.

We  feel  that  since  we  base  our livelyhood on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} that it's future is
extremely important to us not just personally, but financially as well.

We  as  dealers  hear  the  trials  and  tribulations  from  the  end-users, the
distributors,  and  the manufactures. If we could compile many of these problems
together and present them, we just might have a chance.

If  you,  a  dealer, wish to be part of this list, please contact me directly at
the  below  email  address.  You  will  be then entered to the list and have the
ability to discuss with us the @{B}Amiga@{UB}s future and how it relates to all of us.

An  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  dealer  constitutes  a retail establishment that buys and sells @{B}Amiga@{UB}
hardware and software to the end-user public.

A  mailing  list  has been set up as well as an informative website to help mark
the progress of the effort.

@{B}NOVA DESIGN@{UB} RELEASES @{B}IMAGEFX 3.2@{UB} UPGRADE
----------------------------------------

@{I}For Immediate Release@{UI}

@{B}Nova Design, Inc.@{UB}, producers of the award winning @{B}ImageFX@{UB} package and the highly
received  @{B}Aladdin  4D@{UB}  package,  are  proud to announce the exciting version @{B}3.2@{UB}
upgrade  to  @{B}ImageFX@{UB}! @{B}ImageFX@{UB} has been the required graphics application for all
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  owners  and  has  been a part of @{B}Video Toaster@{UB}/@{B}Flyer@{UB} owner's toolkits for
years.  Combining  painting, image file format conversion, image processing, and
special  effects,  @{B}ImageFX@{UB}  is the undisputed leader in graphics manipulation on
the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

When @{B}ImageFX 3.0@{UB} was released, it brought the first implementation of real image
layers  compositing  technology  to  the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. This came with a vastly enhanced
user  interface,  larger  previews,  multiple image windows, faster redraws, and
child  menus.  @{B}Photoshop@{UB}  file  format  import  and  exporting was added and the
ability  to  work directly with color-mapped (CMAP) images! @{B}ImageFX@{UB}, true to its
name,  also  added new effects such as Pagecurler, plasma Clouds, particle pixel
Scatter,  image  Splash,  and  the  amazing @{B}FXForge@{UB} for creating hundreds of new
effects.

@{I}Highlights of the new @{B}ImageFX@{UB}@{UI}

The  newest  release  of  @{B}ImageFX@{UB}  is  version  @{B}3.2@{UB}.  This release has virtually
eliminated  any  reported problems experienced by users in previous releases and
has added many new features as well.

The  new  features  include support for more @{B}BMP@{UB} and @{B}JPEG@{UB} image file subformats,
support for images saved from the @{B}Brilliance@{UB} paint program, and minor updates to
the  @{B}IMP@{UB} batch processor for @{B}ImageFX@{UB}. Many new @{B}Arexx@{UB} commands have been added as
well,  a  new  control  has  been  added to the Layer Manager, and for owners of
pressure sensitive drawing tablets @{B}ImageFX@{UB} now supports pressure in the airbrush
painting  tool.  Major  work was also done to enhance the operation of @{B}ImageFX@{UB}'s
region masks as well!

Support  for older @{B}Hewlett Packard SCSI Scanjet@{UB} models was added along with many
overall  enhancements  to  this module, which include better previews. The @{B}Epson@{UB}
scanner  module  has  been  improved,  but  development of support for the @{B}Epson
Perfection 600@{UB} model was dropped when @{B}Epson@{UB} discontinued this model.

@{I}Ordering the Upgrade@{UI}

The  best  news of all is that owners of @{B}ImageFX 3.0@{UB} through @{B}3.1c@{UB} can download a
free  patch  to  upgrade  to  @{B}ImageFX 3.2@{UB} from the @{B}Nova Design, Inc.@{UB} FTP site at

@{B}RANDOMIZE, INC.@{UB} ANNOUNCES DISTRIBUTION OF @{B}INDIVIDUAL COMPUTER@{UB}'S PRODUCTS

systems.  The  @{B}MultiVision@{UB}  ScanDoubler  and  Flicker  Fixer is an external unit
connecting  to  the @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s 23 pin video connector. The ScanDoubler simple takes
the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s 15Khz signal and doubles it so that it is viewable on a standard @{B}PC
VGA/SVGA@{UB}  monitor  at  31Khz.  The  Flicker  Fixer  version  provides  this same
functionality  but also removes flicker from interlaced screens providing a rock
solid  represenation of all interlaced modes. Both units simply pass through all
screen    modes    above   15Khz.   Further   infomation   can   be   found   at

@{B}PFS 2@{UB}

@{B}Great  Effects  Development@{UB} proudly presents the new @{B}Ami-FileSafe@{UB}... it's called
@{B}PROFESSIONAL  FILESYSTEM  2@{UB}  !  After the failing support and all the complaints
about  former  @{B}AFS@{UB}  distributor  @{B}Fourth  Level Developments@{UB}, the author, @{I}Michiel
Pelt@{UI},  reclaimed  copyright  and  has  republished @{B}PFS2@{UB} under the label of @{B}Great
Effects Development@{UB}.

@{I}@{B}PFS2@{UB}: the BEST filesystem for your @{B}Amiga@{UB}@{UI}

Improvements over @{B}Ami-FileSafe@{UB}:
 * Special price for registered @{B}AFS@{UB} users.
 * @{B}68000@{UB}, @{B}68020@{UB}, @{B}68040@{UB} and @{B}68060@{UB} versions.
 * Build-in  interface  for  live optimiser. There is no optimiser yet, but this
   interface  makes it possible to optimise the disk without taking it off-line.
   When  the disk is accessed during optimisation, @{B}PFS2@{UB} will stop the optimiser,
   which  can continue afterwards. A dormant optimiser can even be automatically
   notified when the system is idle, making optimisation completely transparent.
 * Improved  testing  procedures  making @{B}PFS2@{UB} more stable and reliable than ever
   before.
 * Enhanced   documentation  including  programming  docs  (disk  structure  and
   special packets).
 * New versions of all supplied tools (bug-fixes mostly), @{B}pfsls@{UB}, @{B}diskvalid@{UB}, etc.
 * Full support plus disk repair service.
 * Fully @{B}Ami-FileSafe@{UB} compatible.
 * Early  problem  detection  mechanism.  The  early problem detection mechanism
   detects  problems  with  your  disk  before  it is too late, ensuring optimal
   protection of your data.
 * Extended disk structure to make disk-repair easier.
 * Comes on CD.
 * FREE Bonus: the awardwinning game @{B}Kang Fu@{UB}, now with extra levels!

Plus all that Ami-FileSafe already had
 * superior performance. Up-to 500% improvement over @{B}FFS@{UB}.
 * disk are always valid. No more 'validation disk'!
 * reliability
 * concurrent   access  without  performance  loss.  @{B}PFS2@{UB}  handles  simultaneous
   accesses very well!
 * easy  file-recovery  with  the  delete directory. Getting a deleted file back
   never was so easy.
 * automatically truncated logfiles. Get rid of those ever growing logfiles.

@{B}SIAMESE SYSTEMS@{UB} REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR @{B}AMIGA@{UB}
-------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Following  the  events that have been going on, and the changing fortunes of the
@{B}Amiga@{UB} market, I wish to reaffirm my companies support for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} platform for
as  long  as we are able. Things are very difficult obviously and the news about
@{B}CU  Amiga@{UB}  is very bad, as both it and @{B}Amiga Format@{UB} have been very supportive of
this company in the UK.

As  you  may  be  aware  we are working with @{B}Access Innovations@{UB} to bring the New
@{B}SiamesePCI Amiga@{UB} card, or @{B}Siamese v4@{UB} to the market. Once this product is ready I
believe  it can rejuvenate the @{B}Amiga@{UB} market into a good niche and take the @{B}Amiga
OS@{UB}  places  it has never been, i.e. Into @{B}PC@{UB}'s and @{B}Alpha@{UB}'s. I hope that the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community  will  not  fragment  and instead keep in touch via the many great web
sites  including  ours  ;-) and register their interest in continuing to support
the  companies that are left in the market place. Please understand, no dealers,
no @{B}Amiga@{UB}. Likewise, no @{B}Amiga@{UB} customers and no dealers.

We  have  also decided to drop the price of @{B}Siamese v2.5@{UB} to 69.95 pounds so that
when  the  new @{B}Ariadne@{UB} card hits the streets very shortly then our software will
be  cheaper  to save you money to go towards the Ethernet card. Also all @{B}Siamese@{UB}
software owners will get a discount from their future upgrade to the @{B}Siamese PCI@{UB}
card and processor.

New prices
Siamese v2.1    Serial        29.95£     $  49.95
Siamese v2.5    TCP/IP        69.95£     $ 120.00 approximately.
Siamese v4      PCI Amiga    399.00£     $ 499.00 excludes @{B}040@{UB}/@{B}060@{UB}.

As  some  of  you may be aware supporting the @{B}Alpha@{UB} processor and have some very
good prices on what is the fastest chip on the planet. The new @{B}21264@{UB} look set to
rock the world at last, and the multiple processor boards, well !!

Please check out our web site at @{B}www.siamese.co.uk@{UB}

THE @{B}AMIGA RC5 TEAM@{UB} EFFORT CELEBRATES ITS FIRST ANNIVERSARY
----------------------------------------------------------

@{I}PRESS RELEASE@{UI}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}
August 20th 1998

The  @{B}Amiga  RC5  Team@{UB} effort has entered its second year of existence and we can
proudly look back on the accomplishments of the first. In many ways the @{B}Amiga@{UB} is
experiencing a rebirth, and the first candle is lit again.

Over  the course of the years as mainstream computing has evolved from diversity
in  the eighties to @{B}Wintel@{UB} dominance in the nineties, the general public is more
inclined  to  see  only  the 'advances' @{B}Wintel@{UB} made, where alternative platforms
like  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  seemingly  underwent no change or completely dwindled from the
public eye. But the @{B}Amiga@{UB} did change and adapt, if not commercially, then by its
definition  of  what  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  is.  At  first  it was the technologically advanced
synergy  of hard- and software, then the OS, to what we now regard as @{B}Amiga@{UB}: the
community,  the  spirit, a lifestyle even. And into the future, the promise of a
once  again  far advanced OS and return of an open platform, being defined as we
speak.

The  @{B}Amiga  RC5  Team@{UB} effort quickly grew from a handful of participants to what
seems  a  major  force  on the frontiers of distributed computing, a convergence
between what some might regard as old and new technologies.

We  continue  to prove to the world that the @{B}Amiga@{UB} is in some ways more alive by
the day and that enthousiasm weighs up against other factors, while we soon hope
to prove it in other ways than this effort has as well.

In  this  last  year  we  competed  in four @{B}RSA Labs@{UB}/@{B}Distributed Net@{UB} challenges,
coming  out  ranking  in the top 10 out of thousands of teams in three of these,
beating  other  illustrious  participants  such as @{B}IBM@{UB}, @{B}Hewlett Packard@{UB}, @{B}Siemens
Nixdorf@{UB},  @{B}NetScape@{UB},  @{B}Oracle@{UB}  and  a  host of others, too many to mention, except
maybe for the @{B}Win32@{UB}/@{B}Windows@{UB} team :)

With  over  1200 members (and over 2200 computers) of which over half consist of
@{B}Amiga@{UB}s  in  the  current  @{B}RC5-64@{UB} challenge we have come as close to the top as a
number three daily ranking, while still growing steadily as more people join and
more @{B}PowerPC@{UB} equipped @{B}Amiga@{UB}s fill our ranks.

Once  again  we call to arms, join the effort now and propel the @{B}Amiga@{UB} back into
the  limelight to pave the way for its comeback, possibly winning part of the US
$10,000  award  for  finding the right key in the @{B}RC5-64@{UB} challenge or one of the
upcoming  DES  II  challenges.  For  full  details on what @{B}RC5/DES@{UB}, @{B}RSA Labs@{UB} and
@{B}Distributed  Net@{UB} are and how we fit into all this, see the @{B}Amiga RC5 Team@{UB} effort
homepage listed below.

We  must  thank  all participants for this past year's effort, all companies and

@{B}THE.NEWT@{UB} - A NEW BREED OF @{B}AMIGA@{UB} WEB SITE!
-----------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

You've read the news - now read @{B}the.newt@{UB}!

It  is with great pleasure that I am finally able to announce the first issue of
@{B}the.newt@{UB}  -  a  brand  new  online  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  publication  devoted  to  giving  the
inquisitive  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  owner  some  insight  into the news, rather than news alone.
After  all,  there's a good many @{B}Amiga@{UB}-oriented sights out there that offer some
excellent coverage of the news already, as I'm sure you will have noticed.

As  a  regular  contributor  to  @{B}CU  Amiga Magazine@{UB} for the past six months, and
having spent the last two weeks of @{B}CU@{UB}'s life at its offices in London, now seems
like an ideal - not to mention important - time to provide a little insight into
the demise of @{B}CU@{UB} for those who might be interested.

The  first issue of @{B}the.newt@{UB} includes exclusive pictures, taken on the last ever
day  of producing the magazine, so it should prove to be an interesting read for
anyone curious about @{B}CU@{UB}'s closure.

What's  more,  details of a rather juicy competition - guaranteed to have any @{B}CU@{UB}
reader salivating over their keyboard - should be announced shortly. I can't say
anything more about this at the moment, so stay tuned for further information.

Thanks, and I hope you enjoy reading the first ever issue of @{B}the.newt@{UB}!

@{B}http://www.newt.u-net.com/newt/@{UB}

Regards,

@{I}David Stroud@{UI} - Editor, @{B}the.newt@{UB}
The online @{B}Amiga@{UB} publication for the inquisitive @{B}Amiga@{UB} user.

@{B}TITAN COMPUTER@{UB} GIVE US SOME ANSWERS
--------------------------------------------

The biggest news for most of the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community was the @{B}Computer '98@{UB} release of
@{B}Evils  Doom SE@{UB}, an RPG originally released as shareware. Available in English or
German, the game boasts an improved 3D engine, and nice graphics and animations.
A  demo  of  @{B}Evils  Doom  SE@{UB}  (their  last  @{B}68k@{UB}  project for the moment) will be
available next month, keep an eye on @{B}Titan@{UB}'s web site (see below).

In  the  only  non-gaming news to emerge, @{B}BurnIt@{UB}, their CD writer software, will
also be recieving an update soon.

Also  due for release at @{B}Computer '98@{UB} will be the @{B}Tomb Raider@{UB} clone @{B}Claws of the
Devil@{UB}.  The game will feature horror elements and is likely to be 100% PPC code.
Sales  figures  for  this  game  will  influence  the  development  of two other
projects,  @{B}Total  Combustion  PPC@{UB}  (a  @{B}Carmageddon@{UB}  clone)  and @{B}The Last Days of
Paradise  PPC@{UB} (a space action game). They're looking for sales figures of around
2000 for @{B}Claws of the Devil@{UB} before they come to any decision on these games.

And  @{B}Titan@{UB}  also  put  an  end to speculation by announcing that there will be a
@{B}Shadow  Of  The Third Moon 2 PPC@{UB}. @{B}Black Blade@{UB}, who developed the original @{B}SOTTM@{UB},
were  tremendously  unlucky  with  piracy  figures, and it was claimed that they
logged  three  downloads from a pirate "warez" site for every genuine copy sold.
They'll clearly be hoping for better this time round.

There's  also  a  big surprise planned for @{B}Computer '98@{UB}. They wouldn't, however,
drop any hints.

for  as  long  as people keep talking. We're here to talk about almost anything,
from the @{B}Amiga@{UB} to @{B}Zool@{UB}, or anything inbetween. @{B}ArcNet@{UB} servers are as follows:
 * @{B}ch1.arcnet.vapor.com@{UB}

@{I}The official amigaUni mailing list@{UI}

Need  to  talk? Got something to say, but nowhere to say it? Do you want to talk
to  other  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  owners?  You  need  to join the @{B}aUML@{UB}. Aided by my mailing list
colleagues  @{I}Simon "SimD" Dick@{UI} and @{I}Mark "Tecno" Wilson@{UI}, the list is a public list
for  anyone  subscribed  to it to make postings and recieve answers. In the last
half-month,  I counted 100 posts, and the traffic can only increase. To become a
part of the @{B}aUML@{UB}, and join people such as myself, @{I}Gary Peake@{UI}, @{I}Alan Crandall@{UI}, and
@{B}CU  Amiga PD.Net@{UB} reviewer @{I}Dave Stroud@{UI}, just follow these oh so simple, but oh so
rewarding instructions:
 * Send  an  e-mail with a blank subject line to @{I}majordomo@amigauniverse.ml.org@{UI},
   with "subscribe auml" in the body.
 * If  you  are  subscribing  an  address  different to the one you're currently
   using, add that address on the end.
 * Send  this  mail. You will recieve a confirmation mail asking if you are sure
   you  want to join. Follow the instructions in this mail and you will be added
   to the @{B}aUML@{UB}.
 * Have  fun!  Upon  joining, you will recieve a post welcoming you, telling you
   how  to UNsubscribe, and detailing the rules. We look forward to your company
   and postings.

I hope you will be willing to participate in both ventures, and help @{B}aU@{UB} become a
success.

NEW @{B}AHI@{UB}-BASED AUDIO HARDDISK-RECORDING PROGRAM @{B}PLAYHD@{UB} ANNOUNCED!
----------------------------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Take a look at the @{B}PlayHD@{UB} homepage at: @{B}http://www.wentzler.limit.nl@{UB}

@{B}PlayHD@{UB}  is a 16-bit audio harddisk-recording package, based on the @{B}AHI@{UB}-system by
@{I}Martin  Blom@{UI}.  With  @{B}PlayHD@{UB},  you can do multitracking: play a number of samples
directly from harddisk and simultaneously record another (stereo) track.

Thanks  to  @{B}AHI@{UB},  an  increasing  number of samplers/soundcards can be used with
@{B}PlayHD@{UB}  without re-writing a single bit of code. Even the @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s own Paula chip
can be used to play samples in a special 14-bit calibrated mode.

@{I}Some features of @{B}PlayHD@{UB}@{UI}:
 * This version can now play up to a maximum of 20 samples at a time. The amount
   of samples you can actually play depends on:
    - Processor  power:  since  all  the  mixing  is done by the processor, more
      channels can be mixed at higher frequencies on faster processors.
    - Speed of your harddisk and harddisk-controller. @{B}SCSI@{UB} is preferred.
    - Samplerate:  the  higher,  the  better  quality,  but  more  data hasto be
      processed and loaded from the harddisk per second.
    - The  @{B}AHI@{UB}-mode  you  have selected. Is it a stereo mode, stereo++ mode with
      panning, fast mode etcetera?
    - The  kind of sampler used. Samplers that have their own sample buffers are
      heavily recommended.
 * A  mixing  desk  provides  you with realtime control over volume, panning and
   mute per channel. A master volume slider and a stereo master-volume indicator
   are present too.
 * Full mixer-automation based on event-list: channel faders, panning, mutes and
   master volume can be automated.
 * Full  duplex  playback  and  record:  if  your  soundcard  allows it, you can
   playback samples while recording.
 * Sample-editing  with  the  usual features like cut, paste, copy, erase range.
   Direct to disk, not limited by memory.
 * Effects  like  Delay,  Noise Gate, Chorus, Comp/Limiter, Amplifier, Frequency
   filters and FIR-filters can be applied.
 * MIDI  synchronisation:  by  sending  a MIDI start-command and a Song Position
   Pointer,  you  can synchronize audio with an external MIDI sequencer. You can
   also receive MIDI start-commands.
 * etc.

For  further information or a demo-version take a look at my homepage or contact
me at @{I}wentzler@limit.nl@{UI}.

Enjoy!

@node not55 "PRELUDE1200: A SOUND CARD FOR THE A1200"

@{B}PRELUDE1200@{UB}: A SOUND CARD FOR THE @{B}A1200@{UB}
---------------------------------------

@{I}The internal @{B}A1200@{UB} version@{UI}

This  new  soundcard will plug into the @{B}A1200@{UB}'s realtime clock port along with a
connection  terminal  in  the  rear expansion booth. It has an active microphone
input  with  pre  amplifier  and power supply for condenser microphones. All the
other  features  are  almost identical to the 'big' @{B}Prelude@{UB}, e.g. true 44100 and
48000 Hz fullduplex, a multi channel mixer, record level adjustment, etc.

@{I}About  @{B}Prelude@{UB}'s  soundchip@{UI}  The  @{B}CS4231A@{UB}  from  @{B}Crystal@{UB}  is a combined encoder,
decoder  and  mixer  (CODEC)  especially  designed  for  high  quality  computer
soundcards  and  can be found on the @{B}Terratec Maestro@{UB} boards for example. It has
all  the  filters  and  a  high  accuracy  voltage  reference  already built in.
Additional  filters  on  the @{B}Prelude1200@{UB} board keep the noise down even further.
The soundchip is controlled by a new version of my fast @{B}ISA@{UB} bridge. Two separate
FIFOs for record and playback allow reliable full duplex operation at low system
load.

@{I}Full  @{B}AHI@{UB} support@{UI} Because @{B}Prelude 1200@{UB} is 99% hardware compatible with the @{B}Zorro@{UB}
version,  only  little  changes  have to be made to the drivers to archieve full
software  compatibility.  The  new  drivers  will  be  just  a few bytes larger,
autodetecting  which @{B}Prelude@{UB} model you have installed. In other words, no matter
which @{B}Prelude@{UB} you have, you can use the same drivers and the same software!

@{I}Current state of the project:@{UI}
 * First prototype is up and running!
 * A beta version of the @{B}AHI@{UB} driver is available, too.

Release date: November 1998, at the @{B}Computer98@{UB} fair in Cologne

@{B}PERSUASIVE SOFTWORX@{UB} JOINS @{B}REGNET@{UB}
--------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

@{B}PerSuaSiVe   SoftWorX@{UB}  just  has  joined  @{B}RegNet@{UB}  -  The  Registration  Network:
@{B}http://www.reg.net@{UB}

Several  of our separate programs and bundles now can be ordered online by using
credit cards and other paying servives as offered by @{B}Regnet@{UB}.

HOWEVER YOU STILL CAN ORDER DIRECTLY FROM US

@{B}RegNet@{UB}  can  accept  nearly all kinds of payment. They take the following credit
cards:  @{B}MasterCard@{UB},  @{B}Visa@{UB},  @{B}American  Express@{UB}, @{B}Novus@{UB} (@{B}Discover@{UB}). For high ticket
items (over $150) they can issue an invoice against a purchase order for payment
by  check  or  credit  card. They also accept money orders or checks (payable to
@{B}Wintronix@{UB} or @{B}RegNet@{UB}).

If  you  don't have a credit card, @{B}RegNet@{UB} can accept cash, check or money order.
Be  sure  to  include  all  of  your contact information with your payment. Make
checks (drawn on a US bank) payable to @{B}RegNet@{UB} and send to the following address:
 @{B}RegNet@{UB} (@{B}Wintronix, Inc.@{UB})
     24303 Walnut Street, Suite 20
     Newhall, CA 91321-2900
     U.S.A.

@{B}RegNet@{UB}   can   be   reached  on  the  World  Wide  Web  at  the  following  URL:
@{B}http://www.reg.net@{UB}

or by calling 1 800 WWW2REG (1 800 999-2734) or (805) 288-1827.

The following packages/bundles currently are available:
ID        Content                             Pricing         Shipped
#2662     SViewII                             27 USD (20+7)   keyfile

#2668     PNG-Box                             27 USD (20+7)   keyfile

#2670     (2) + PNG-Box                       77 USD (64+13)  keyfiles, binaries

In  the  brackets  you  see  that I had to increase the prices by the costs that
@{B}Regnet@{UB} takes from me (10 percent of the price plus 5 USD). Note, that this isn't
a  fee  taken  for credit card payment, but a fee resulting out of the fact that
@{B}RegNet@{UB} has to be paid for its service.

However, you save the costs and the risk of shipping the money via snail mail to
me, the expensive costs to do postal money orders and so on. Also, by choosing a
bundle, you still may save some money.

We,  on  the  other  hand,  have to pay additional fees for cashing the American
cheques @{B}Regnet@{UB} will send us - so, it's fair.

Shipment always takes place via eMail, no media will be sent.

Disclaimer:  this  is  just  a  table  to simplify the discount calculation. For
actual  copyright  and  other legal and trade information please see the program
documentation and the registration forms themselves.

Prices  are  subject  to  changes  when  applicable.  If the price for a certain
program  does  change, ignore it in the table above and check it out directly at
@{B}http://www.reg.net@{UB} or @{B}http://www.swregnet.com@{UB}

LAMBDA NEWS

The following is from the @{B}Lambda@{UB} Web site at:

A  lot  has  happened  to @{B}Lambda@{UB} since the last news posting. The latest working
version  is  @{B}20.81@{UB}  and  it  has become far removed from the last public release
demo. Here listed are some of the major additions:

Preliminary  AI for friendly and enemy fighters - obstacle avoidance, navigation
and combat intellegence.

New  effects - @{B}Lambda@{UB} sports many new graphical effects for weapons, explosions,
HUDs  etc  -  to  the extent that the last public demo looks as featureless as a
marble brick :)

@{B}AHI@{UB}  support! Yes at last we have sound effects, although the effects themselves
are  temporary,  they are available in 16-bit for sound card owners, and regular
8-bit for @{B}Paula@{UB}. Full AHI surround support is included, stereo panning, distance
fading.  Multichannel  support  with provision for many fx layers and additional
stereo incidental music layers (if applicable).

A squadron of new ships - fighters thru freighters.

Finally, general coding enhancements for better speed and flexibility

@{B}PPC@{UB} Version!

@{B}Lambda@{UB}  has  been  successfully  ported  to  the  @{B}PPC@{UB}  - It has been tested on a
@{B}Cyberstorm  604e@{UB}/200  @{B}060@{UB}/50  and  a  @{B}Blizzard  603e@{UB}/160  @{B}040@{UB}/25 - Initial speed
estimates for the @{B}Cyberstorm@{UB} are in excess of 70fps.

However,  this was not sufficient to impress any member of the Command Crew into
continuing   @{B}PPC@{UB}   development.  Suffice  to  say  that  it  works,  a  port  is
theoretically  possible  and  will  only  be  implemented  if there is a clearer
picture  as  to  the  future  of the @{B}Amiga PPC@{UB}. Please no emails concerning this
matter, if you wish for a @{B}Lambda PPC@{UB} version, then mail @{B}Phase5@{UB} and @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} and
request   that   they  lift  the  noxious  green  fog  surrounding  current  @{B}PPC@{UB}
development. ;)

ENFORCE NEWS

The following is from the @{B}Insanity@{UB} Web site at:

In screenshots section was added one new screenshot.

We  decide,  that  demo  version  will  not be, until at least one level will be
finished.  I  understand,  that  you  want  to  see how @{B}Enforce@{UB} looks today, but
completing  of demo version takes a lot of time, which I really don't have. I'll
add some new screenshots in near future.

Support  for @{B}i-Glasses@{UB} (3D glasses for virtual reality) was added even with head
tracking.  Is  possible  to  add also support for very cheap glasses @{B}3D Max@{UB} with
simple hardware hack. Now you can see it all in REAL 3D :-)

@{B}Important  information:@{UB}  Certain  not  well-informed redactor of Polish magazine
@{B}Amiga  Computer  Studio@{UB} has written completely foolish information that the game
@{B}Enforce@{UB}  is based on modified @{B}Quake@{UB} engine from the @{B}ClickBOOM@{UB}. This statement is
not  based on facts because @{B}Enforce@{UB} has got its own original engine. This engine
has  got  nothing  in  common  with  the  game called @{B}Quake@{UB}. I would like to ask
redactors  of  that  magazine mentioned above to put this misleading information
right  and  next  time  when  they  need  some information they should have them
verified instead of making up similar mistakes.

The following is from the @{B}Amiga RC5 Team@{UB} effort homepage at:
                @{B}http://www.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/rc5/@{UB}

03-Jul-98

Due  to  a  newly found security hole in the @{B}MicroSoft-IIS/4.0@{UB} server (so what's
new  :)  stats have been moved, hence the links were broken for a short time, if
you  have  scripts pointing towards them please change those. A note of reminder
that  @{B}DES II-2@{UB} starts ten days from now (13th July), so upgrade to a @{B}DES@{UB} capable
client  if  you  haven't  done  so  yet and set @{I}preferredcontest=2@{UI} (the upcoming
@{B}2.7100@{UB}  client  will have a slightly different @{I}.ini@{UI} file entry for this, more on
this when it becomes available). Also, the turnaround time for @{B}DES II-2@{UB} needs to
be  minimal,  since  redistribution of the keyspace is expected after around six
days  already,  so set your clients to fetch the smallest blocksize (228) and do
not  buffer more than you can do in one single day, preferably flush immediately
blocks are done (after the sixth day ideally flush after every block :). We look
like  catching  the @{B}Win32@{UB} team within a week too now if current differences keep
up, time to break out the champagne :)

12-Jul-98

Champagne  time!  We beat the @{B}Win32@{UB} team and are now ranked 6th overall, just in
time  for  the Monday start of @{B}DES II-2@{UB} :) Everyone tell the client to switch to
@{B}DES@{UB} on Monday (get a @{B}DES@{UB} capable client if you haven't got one yet), the interim
@{B}DES  II-2@{UB} challenge will only last 10 days or so, if not less. Another chance to
be  ranked  up  high,  perhaps  find  the  key. Don't worry about the @{B}Win32@{UB} team
catching  us in the meantime, we have plenty of time to make up for the ten days
of  @{B}DES  II-2@{UB}.  The  new @{B}2.7100@{UB} client should be very near approval now as well,
stay  tuned.  Also,  after some discussion on the mailinglist we have chosen the
@{B}Jay Miner Society@{UB} (@{B}http://www.jms.org/@{UB}) as our designated non-profit, as soon as
they  appear  in the non-profit list, please select them as benefactors (this is
separate  to  team attribution). Part of the prize money will go to them in case
they  get  enough votes (decided on the number of blocks attributed). While this
is not likely, it still means an @{B}Amiga@{UB} oriented non- profit will be in the list.

13-Jul-98

New  clients  out!  Just  in  time  for  the  @{B}DES  II-2@{UB} challenge start, clients
@{B}v2.7100.413@{UB}  are  out,  please  switch  ASAP, should cure the runoffline problem
amongst  others.  The  ini  file  format  has  changed  slightly, amongst others
'preferredcontest'  has  been replaced by 'processdes', set this to processdes=1
to automatically switch to @{B}DES II-2@{UB} when it starts Monday (this will happen when
you  first  contact  the proxies after the start of the challenge, so flush your
blocks Monday evening (18:00 CET at least)).

13-Jul-98

According  to  @{I}Stefan@{UI}  the  slight  @{B}RC5@{UB}  core slowdown is due to the rest of the
client,  major  cleanup  etc. For @{B}DES II-2@{UB} the latest client is fastest, so keep
using it! :) We should have first @{B}DES@{UB} statistics results early tomorrow morning,
the @{B}Bovine@{UB} effort in it's entirety is doing over 21 GKeys/s already only after a
couple  of  hours  of  the effort, whereas this took almost a week for @{B}DES II-1@{UB},
0.25%  of  the  keyspace  now returned, with 5.75% distributed (part of which is
probably  already  done,  but buffered). This is going to be quick, se get on it
NOW :)

14-Jul-98

The first stats are in, we are ranked 17th overall after the first day, which is
only  a couple of hours in reality, tomorrow we should have a clearer picture of
the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  team  performance. Only 100 people managed to flush blocks for this,
hopefully  this  will  improve soon as well. Remember to set E-mail address, the
new @{B}v2.7100@{UB} client does not have @{I}rc5@amiga.cistron.nl@{UI} as default!

14-Jul-98 (update)

Second  day  stats  are  in,  over 6% of keyspace done (current total rate: 46.7
Gkeys/s)  and  we  are up into the top 10 :) Looks like we are doing nicely, but
one  third of @{B}DES@{UB} blocks are coming from the older 7.021 client, which is slower
on    @{B}DES@{UB}    than    the    new    @{B}2.7100@{UB}    clients!    Switch   now!   Updated
@{B}http://homepage.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/rc5/corporate.html@{UB} Corporate Supporters page
to point to @{B}DES II-2@{UB} statistics.

15-Jul-98

Third  day  @{B}DES  II-2@{UB} stats are in, are you drunk yet? You should be, because we
passed  the @{B}Win32@{UB} team again :) Currently ranked 9th overall with a whopping 626
Mkeys/s  for  yesterday, 13.7% of the keyspace is done. Looking better every day
:)  @{I}Roberto  Patriarca@{UI}  (@{I}r.patriarca@flashnet.it@{UI}) has written a nice GUI for the
@{B}2.7100@{UB} client (not for earlier versions!) using @{B}MUI@{UB}, with oodles of options like
iconify, progress bars etc. Get it at @{B}http://pratesi.it/~patriot/myzar.lha@{UB}

16-Jul-98

Day  4: 22.2% of total keyspace done, it's an excitingly close battle. While our
rate  increased  slightly,  we  lost 400 blocks to the @{B}Win32@{UB} team yesterday, but
remained  9th  overall  and  gained  4000 blocks on the closely 8th placed @{B}Linux@{UB}
team. Whip those machines, only a couple of days left! :)

18-Jul-98

@{B}DES II-2@{UB} is over! That's right, @{B}DES II-2@{UB} has already been concluded in much less
than  the  projected ten days. Shame on you if you didn't do @{B}DES@{UB} because of @{B}RC5@{UB},
and  congrats  to everyone who participated for ranking us in a very visible 9th
overall spot.

The  actual finder of the key is not @{B}Distributed Net@{UB} however, but the @{B}Electronic
Frontier  Foundation@{UB},  or  @{B}EFF@{UB}  for  short,  a  non-profit organization which is
concerned with privacy and free speech issues on the Internet, amongst others.

They  built a special '@{B}DES@{UB} cracker' for about $250,000 which cracked @{B}DES II-2@{UB} in
56  hours,  or  almost  2.5 days. In the same period of time the @{B}Distributed Net@{UB}
effort  we  participate  in  did  somewhere in the region of 10-15% of that same
keyspace  and currently equals the @{B}'Deep Crack'@{UB} machine's power, while still 40%
of  the  machines  in  the  effort were doing @{B}RC5-64@{UB}. @{B}Distributed Net@{UB}'s power is
expected  to  grow  to  2.6  times  to that of @{B}'Deep Crack'@{UB} by the time @{B}DES II-3@{UB}
starts,  the  next  installment  of  @{B}RSA Labs'@{UB} series of challenges. (The @{B}Bovine@{UB}
effort lasted 4 days total because they waited for confirmation of @{B}RSA Labs@{UB} that
the @{B}EFF@{UB} found key was indeed the correct one.)

What  does  this  mean?  A  well  done  to  @{B}EFF@{UB}  for  showing a relatively small
non-profit  can  embarrass the US government in only 2,5 days (who contended for
years  that it would take multi million Dollar investments and months to do it),
the  same  to @{B}Distributed Net@{UB} for doing almost the same with just enthusiasm and
spare  cycles,  and  to  us,  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  team for ranking this high in spite of
everyone around us dressing black and holding their noses :)

Also,  some  well  deserved  exposure  for  the team and @{B}Amiga@{UB} in general, and a
little  regret  for  not  having  found the key ourselves (or getting more time,
since  we  looked to overtake @{B}Linux@{UB} team as well, in addition of the @{B}Win32@{UB} team,
perhaps even reaching the magical one Gigakey/s limit :)

What  next?  We  continue with @{B}RC5-64@{UB} of course, where we are ranked 6th overall
out of more than 3000 teams. You don't have to do anything special for this, the
client  @{B}v2.7100@{UB}  switches back to @{B}RC5-64@{UB} automatically when it connects again to
one  of the @{B}Bovine@{UB} proxies. Please delete any @{B}DES@{UB} blocks you still have buffered
as those are landfill now, and switch clients back to @{B}RC5-64@{UB} in case they didn't
by themselves.

19-Jul-98

@{B}RC5-64@{UB}  statistics  are  back.  We  are  still  ranked  6th overall and although
@{B}Slashdot.org@{UB}  is  making  uncannily  good  speed (they'll catch us in 10 days at
current  differences), we are doing better every day and looking like a possible
candidate  to  overtake  the  @{B}LinuxNET@{UB}  team sometime in the (hopefully) not too
distant future :)

24-Jul-98

The  currently  fastest  team,  @{B}Slashdot.org@{UB} passed us today, looks like the @{B}EFF@{UB}
crack  publicity  helped to more than double their rate. Congratulations to them
of  course, we need to shine by getting ourselves faster, not hoping others will
remain/get slower. We enjoyed 6th overall ranking for 12 days, and possibly will
again  as our rate is steadily increasing, more @{B}PowerPC@{UB} equipped @{B}Amigas@{UB} and more
machines  in  general  join  the  effort.  So,  the  moral of the story is: keep
cracking and get more people to join the team! If you are not on the mailinglist
yet,  join  the  discussion  now,  and participate in current topics such as the
cunning plans for using the @{B}Permedia 2@{UB} for bitslicing, etc. :)

03-Aug-98

@{I}Roberto  Patriarca@{UI} (@{I}r.patriarca@flashnet.it@{UI}) has updated the @{B}Myzar GUI@{UB} (now also
for  @{B}2.7100.405@{UB}  as well as newer, faster refresh, supports @{B}PPC@{UB} and @{B}AmiTCP@{UB}/@{B}Miami@{UB}
and  many  more).  Get  it  at @{B}http://pratesi.it/~patriot/myzar/myzar.lha@{UB}. Small
update  on  the rankings: we have consistently been doing over 300 Mkeys/s (with
now  more  than  20%  @{B}PPC@{B}  equipped  @{B}Amiga@{UB}s),  which means in time we will catch
@{B}LinuxNet@{UB}  and  move  back  up  to 6th. At current rates that's still more than 3
months  though,  which means we are still growing but we could do that faster :)
So  again a call to arms, tell everyone and get them in on the effort! Also, the
next update of the client is being worked on as we speak, more about that later.

20-Aug-98

Today The @{B}Amiga RC5 Team@{UB} effort is celebrating its first anniversary!

We  started  off  after  a 'cool, let's do this' session on IRC with a couple of
machines  and look where that got us <G>. A Press Release will go out shortly on
this,  spread the word! This is also an excellent time to alert mainstream media
and  hopefully  get  a  mention  of  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  and  how things _can_ boom on a
supposedly dead platform if the enthusiasm is there..

Note on the mail flushing mechanism (most people use the client to flush, ignore
this  bit  unless  you  can only use E-mail to fetch/flush): the engine has been
revised/rewritten,  not  all  functionality  has  been  reimplemented yet but it
should  be  a  lot faster now. It can currently only handle MIME attached base64
encoded     buffer     files     (apart     from     this    restriction,    see
@{B}http://www.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/misc/blocksbymail.txt@{UB}    explanation   for   this
mechanism)

21-Aug-98

Three  hoorays  for  @{B}Justin  Pope@{UB}  (@{B}http://www.galstar.com/~jupo/@{UB}) and the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community  spirit!  He kindly donated a replacement drive (3.5 GB IDE) after the
main  'effort  HD' started dying last week. A nice effort birthday gift :) Today
we  also  broke the 400 Mkey/s barrier and ranked 5th daily with that, way to go
team!

23-Aug-98

The  second percent of the keyspace has been searched. Whereas the first percent
took  seven  months,  the second one took only three, illustrating the growth of
the overall effort (which is still way ahead of @{I}Moore@{UI}'s Law). Continuing at this
rate  we  will  have  done  3% in about 2 more months and getting similar growth
rates  further  on. Although it's still too early to speculate on whether growth
rates  keep  up,  or  will  possibly  increase,  methods  based on linear growth
calculation  predict  that we will have found the right key during the year 2000
or  2001.  Also  for  yesterday  we  ranked third overall with an impressive 453
Mkeys/s,  doing  nearly  twice  as much blocks as @{B}LinuxNet@{UB}, whom we should catch
before the 3% mark :)

23-Aug-98 (update)

Finally   added   PR   on   the   first   anniversary   in   the  press  section
(@{B}http://www.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/press.html@{UB}), time to bombard the media! :)

With  the development continuing of the @{B}Amiga PPC@{UB} version and the length of time
it  will take to complete the game development, it has been decided that the @{B}68k@{UB}
version  of @{B}Explorer 2260@{UB} will be cancelled. We feel the @{B}68k@{UB} range of @{B}Amiga@{UB}s are
not  able  to  provide  the necessary CPU power that @{B}E2260@{UB} would require for the

tweak it over and over. @{B}NAPALM@{UB} will be absolutely brilliant and perfection can't
be reached overnight. Please be patient, and stay tuned for more info.

@{I}Will @{B}NAPALM@{UB} rule, man?@{UI}
You bet it will.

@{I}I have this great idea you guys could implement...@{UI}
Let  us  know  - @{I}info@clickboom.com@{UI} - but please be aware it might not end up in
the game.

New        @{B}Quake@{UB}        (@{B}http://www.clickboom.com/quake/index.html@{UB}),        @{B}Myst@{UB}

(@{B}http://www.clickboom.com/capitalpunishment/index.html@{UB}) sites.

@{B}clickBOOM@{UB} will be having a much deserved vacation Aug.15 - Sep.1. There probably
won't be any updates to the web site.

@{B}AMIWEST '98@{UB} SHOW REPORT FROM @{I}ASHA DEVELDER@{UI}
------------------------------------------

13-Jul-98 02:00:01

Subject: @{B}AmiWest '98@{UB}
From: @{I}Asha DeVelder@{UI}/SYSOP 76703,4322
To: @{I}All@{UI}

I've been back from @{B}AmiWest '98@{UB} for a few hours now. It was hot. :)

The  show was held in the Ramada Inn in Sacremento. The Inn is a small hotel but
cozy.  @{B}AmiWest@{UB}  took  up (at least) three rooms for the three day show. The main
room had about two dozen (guesstimate) boths and there were two seminar rooms in
use almost constantly.

In  the  main  room,  @{I}Holger  Kruse@{UI} (@{B}Miami@{UB}) was there, as was @{I}Chris Aldi@{UI} (@{B}Finale
Developement@{UB}, @{B}New York@{UB}, @{B}Quill@{UB}, @{B}Voodoo@{UB}, etc), @{I}Kermit Woodall@{UI} (@{B}ImageFX@{UB}, @{B}Aladdin4D@{UB})
as  well  as  @{I}Paul  Nolan@{UI}  (@{B}Photogenics_NG@{UB})  and  a  few others I can't remember
(sorry),  various  magazines  (@{B}Amazing@{UB},  @{B}Informer@{UB}) and services (@{B}Amigazone@{UB}--@{I}Harv
Laser@{UI}),  and  the user groups also had booths as well as a few retail outlets (I
got  @{B}Genetic  Species@{UB}).  Business seemed to be brisk; people were walking around
with bags full of stuff and wearing new t-shirts as well.

The seminars seemed to be well attended. I sat in when @{I}Carl@{UI} gave his second talk
about  @{B}REBOL@{UB},  and  also the demos/discussions with @{I}Chris Aldi@{UI} and @{I}Paul Nolan@{UI} (I
*really* want @{B}Photogenics_NG@{UB}!!) and the rooms were packed.

The  mood  was  very  positive  and  upbeat in stark contrast to the last show I
attended in '92 (@{B}WOA@{UB}) Pasadena.

Neither  @{I}Jeff  Shindler@{UI}, @{I}Joe Torre@{UI}, @{I}Fleecy Moss@{UI}, nor @{I}Alan Havemose@{UI} could attend.
We  were told they were at very important meetings/negotiations but no more than
that.  Attending from @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} were @{I}Darrick Lisle@{UI}, Events Co-ordinator and @{I}Bill
McEwen@{UI} head of marketing and software evangalist.

The  following,  in no particular order (I've only had 8 hours sleep in the past
three days) is the information I gathered while there:
 * The rumor of an @{B}IBM@{UB} buyout of @{B}Gateway@{UB} is false
 * The rumor of @{B}BE@{UB} buying out @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} is false
 * The  information  in  the  @{B}Investment Business Weekly@{UB} was badly misquoted and
   therefore is not correct.

@{B}Gateway@{UB}  is  not  for  sale.  @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} is not for sale. (@{I}Carl@{UI} added that @{B}REBOL@{UB}
isn't for sale either)

Speaking  of  @{B}REBOL@{UB},  there  should  be a general version available early in the
fall, with @{B}Amiga@{UB} one of the first platforms supported.

Re: @{B}OS5.0@{UB}

The  kernal  to be used is the @{B}Amiga@{UB} kernal. They will be using @{B}Exec@{UB}. There will
be direct @{B}Java@{UB} support (@{B}JVM@{UB}) as well as support for @{B}OpenGL@{UB}.

A  developer  program  will  be  set up soon, projected date August (this year).
@{B}Amiga  Inc@{UB}  wants  ALL developers and developer wannabees to come and sign up on
their  site. There will be a special area (password protected) for developers to
get  and  exchange  information.  Anyone  who  is  even  slightly  interested is
encouraged to sign up (this was emphasized).

I  don't have much on the @{B}MMC@{UB}. There were some rather specific specs shown but I
couldn't  get  them written down fast enough... (sorry) they will also be posted
on  @{B}Amiga  Inc@{UB}'s  pages soon. We were told the chip was NOT being made by @{B}Intel@{UB},
@{B}Cyrix@{UB}  (sp?)  or  @{B}AMD@{UB}.  When I get more specific information I shall, of course,
post it.

We  were  also  told that @{B}Windows@{UB} would NOT be on the development machine (@{B}Amiga
Bridge OS4.0@{UB}). @{I}"No money to @{B}Microsoft@{UB}"@{UI} is a direct quote.

@{I}Bill  McEwen@{UI}  said  that if anyone had any questions, he'd be more than happy to
answer them. You can contact him at @{I}bm@amigainc.com@{UI}. He said he would answer all
polite  mail.  He  also said he'd not answer any rude or nasty mail but that *he
would keep it*.

Speaking  of development. @{I}Olaf Bartel@{UI} (sp?) has been doing extensive work in the
@{B}Development  CD@{UB}  and the @{B}RKM@{UB}s, they have been bugfixed and upgraded (now @{B}version
2.1@{UB}). This should be available soon.

@{I}Dave  Haynie@{UI}  has  also  released  a  lot  of  information.  It  can be found on
@{B}http://www.thule.no/haynie/@{UB}. There will be more.

@{I}Denny Atkins@{UI} is coming back to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

There  might  be a bit more, but I'm getting really tired... If I remember more,
or  get  more  clarification,  I shall pass it on to you. I did have a wonderful
time,  despite the heat and some physical problems, and I feel more hopeful than
ever about the future of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

@{B}AMIWEST '98@{UB} SHOW REPORT FROM @{I}JEFFREY D. WEBSTER@{UI}
-----------------------------------------------

Needless to say, there were no overwhelming announcements. However, we did enjoy
some exciting guests. I'll start from the beginning.

Upon  arriving,  after  a  miserable  ordeal  with the airline, I was greeted by
@{I}Christopher  Aldi@{UI}  (@{B}ClassAct@{UB}, @{B}NewYork@{UB}). We were waiting for a ride to the hotel.
@{I}Bill Borsari@{UI} (@{B}UGN@{UB} Event Coordinator) picked us up. The madness began.

All of us were very high-strung, and excited about doing another show. All of us
except @{I}Robert Hamilton@{UI} (@{I}Lostman@{UI}) who was sleeping in the hotel room.

Sleeping?

On  Friday  morning  the  setup was underway. I tested my machine from the hotel
room,  and  then  assisted  @{I}Bill  Borsari@{UI},  @{I}Wayne  Hunt@{UI} (@{B}UGN@{UB}), and @{I}Darreck Lisle@{UI}
(@{B}Amiga,  Inc.@{UB})  in  setting  up  the  @{B}UGN@{UB} Booth. Not an easy task with 300 pound
Destination  monitors.  There were some difficulties, like the fact that @{I}Darreck@{UI}
had  to run 50 feet of phone cord out of the room and across a hall to get phone
service to the booth.

The  @{B}UGN@{UB}, headed by @{I}Wayne Hunt@{UI}, assisted by @{I}Darreck Lisle@{UI} and @{I}Bill Borsari@{UI} had a
nice  sized  booth  with  one Destination Monitor showing the @{B}UGN@{UB} Kiosk machine.
Which  was an @{B}A1200@{UB} running @{B}Scala@{UB}. It was professionally done, and with a lot of
help  from @{I}Casey Halverson@{UI}, it was even better. Connected with the @{B}UGN@{UB} Booth was
@{I}Lostman@{UI} with his @{B}Amiga@{UB} shirts, shorts, an sweaters.

Great  looking  clothes. We (the royal "We") shared a booth with @{I}Lostman@{UI}, though
we  had  no  product thanks to a complete lack of luck during the days preceding
the  show  (it's a sad story, perhaps another time). Instead, we were honored by
having  the @{B}UGN@{UB} use ChatBox for the IRC conferences. Another Destination monitor
showed  the  IRC  conferences.  @{B}Amiga, Inc.@{UB} provided these monitors, by the way.
They did not have to. And it was greatly appreciated. Good job @{I}Darreck@{UI}.

Again,  I  have  to  give  a  hats-off to @{I}Bill Borsari@{UI}. He dedicates his time to
making  these  shows go off as smoothly as possible for the @{B}UGN@{UB}. He has aided in
keeping us well informed, and giving us a "@{B}WebCam@{UB}'s" view of the whole event. He
is  an  asset  to  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  community.  Come to IRC channel @{B}#Amiga@{UB} on servers
@{B}linux.us.amiganet.org@{UB},  or  @{B}whiterose.us.amiganet.org@{UB} and look for @{I}Bill@{UI} to thank
him for a great year of service. His IRC nickname is @{I}"tekmage"@{UI}.

On with the show.

To  the  immediate right of our booth was @{B}Nova Design@{UB}. @{I}Kermit Woodall@{UI} showed off
the  latest capabilities of @{B}ImageFX@{UB} with the help and expertise of @{I}Corinna Cohn@{UI}.
She  has  amazing skills with @{B}ImageFX@{UB}, and knows it like the back of her hand. I
bought  another  copy  of  @{B}Aladdin  4D@{UB}, as well as @{B}Catalyzer Volumes I@{UB} & @{B}II@{UB}. Big
Spender, eh?

@{UI}Chris  Aldi@{UI} showed off his line of products from @{B}Finale Developments@{UB}. As well as
@{B}"Digital Quill"@{UB} by @{I}Timothy Ashton@{UI}. Luck was not with @{I}Chris@{UI} for this show, as his
@{B}A3000@{UB}  went  on the blink. However, he did a great job in spite of it. He's been
dedicated to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} since the beginning.

@{UI}Harv  Laser@{UI}  was  right  next to @{B}Finale Developments@{UB}. Was he wearing the coveted
crown  of  the mighty "User Representative"? No, he was humbly dressed, greeting
people  as they passed, and enjoying lots of talk and stories. Of course, he was
also promoting @{B}AmigaZone@{UB}.

From  the  retail  standpoint we had @{B}Lively Computers@{UB}, and @{B}VisionSoft@{UB}. They were
far  too busy for me to even get a look at what they had for any length of time.
Both  companies  had great representatives that were friendly, and loved to talk
shop. What a great place to be.

One  of  the  most  interesting  conversations I had was with @{I}Bob Scharp@{UI}. A very
modest  individual  with an extremely kind wife. He has reason to brag, however,
they've  done  a  great  job  with the St. Louis show over the years. And I look
forward  to  exhibiting  there  next year. At his display were the nicest coffee
mugs  an @{B}Amiga@{UB}n could ever see. They had a black checkmark on one side and a big
black  circle  on the other side. Gee, sounds great, doesn't it? Well, pour some
hot  liquid  in  there  -- I suggest coffee, myself -- and the checkmark becomes
colored,  and  the large black circle becomes a smiling face. @{I}Bob@{UI} told me, @{I}"This
side  shows  a  black  check  mark because the @{B}Amiga@{UB} died, and this side shows a
black  circle because the @{B}Amiga@{UB} died. Put a hot liquid in the cup, and the check
mark  becomes  colorful, and the circle becomes a smiling face because the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
is alive again."@{UI} Cheers, @{I}Bob@{UI}! It was great meeting you.

One  person  that is always a joy to listen to because he is a virtual knowledge
bank  is  @{I}Holger Kruse@{UI}. He knows his stuff, and if you don't have @{B}Miami@{UB}, GET IT!
He  has worked tirelessly to give us easy internet access, and he's done it with
the  greatest modesty. And his intentions are unbelievable. Did he do it for the
money?  Did he do it for the recognition? Why did he work so hard for so little?
($30  a  copy is REAL cheap for a professional package like @{B}Miami@{UB}) He did it for
the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}, and it's users. At first we all questioned his intentions. Like, was
he trying to take over what @{B}AmiTCP@{UB} had given us?

Certainly,  but  without malice. He did it because the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community needed an
easy  way  to get on the internet. And, for those of you that criticize @{B}Miami@{UB} --
because  @{B}WinSock@{UB} is "free" -- don't knock it until you try it. @{B}WinSock@{UB} is "FREE"
for a reason. That is about all it is worth. @{B}Miami@{UB} is far more complete a TCP/IP
stack than @{B}WinSock@{UB}. Enjoy what you have. Thank you @{I}Holger@{UI}.

Now,  there  were some things I just had to see. I wanted to see @{I}Carl Sassenrath@{UI}
seminar  on  @{B}REBOL@{UB}  (sounds  like  "rebel").  This man has an excellent sense of
humor,  and he's very down to earth. @{B}REBOL@{UB} sounds like a very exciting language.
I can't wait to implement a @{B}REBOL@{UB} interface in some of our projects.

He  described,  in  great detail, how @{B}REBOL@{UB} really works, and what it's meant to
do.  He is so surprisingly Pro-@{B}Amiga@{UB}. Dedicated to his creation, I suppose. @{I}Carl@{UI}
also  spoke  at  the  banquet dinner, where he showed slides from the very early
days  of  @{B}Amiga@{UB}.  Included  in  the  slides  were  pictures  of  the  early  @{B}MOS@{UB}
implementations  of  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  Chipset.  He  had interesting stories about the
trials  of  getting the @{B}Amiga@{UB} to work. He shared many funny stories about events
that took place at @{B}Amiga@{UB}. @{I}RJ Mical@{UI} blowing up fish in the microwave?

Human society, anyone? ;)

Of  course,  the event we had all been waiting for. Hearing @{I}Jeff Schindler@{UI} speak
about  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}.  Oops.  Something came up, so @{I}Jeff@{UI} was unable to attend (I'll
elaborate later). Well, at least now we have Dr. @{I}Allan Havemose@{UI}.

Oops. You know the story. Big disappointment. But they more than made up for it.
Frankly,  everyone was pleasantly surprised by a man that very few know anything
about  --  besides  his  name.  @{I}Bill  McEwen@{UI}  was  an outstanding speaker, great
motivator, and despite his lack of techno-knowledge, an expert in this field. He
should  be  trusted  as  a  marketing director. He spoke very well, very clearly
outlining the intentions and the road map for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

Many  questions  were answered, without the usual thousand more that result from
the answers. He covered his speech with good humor, and professionalism.

His  speech  was long, but by no means unbearable (aside from there being no air
conditioner  in that room). He should be commended and thanked warmly for making
this  unexpected  trip  to  Sacramento  to  stand  in for @{I}Jeff Schindler@{UI} and Dr.
@{I}Havemose@{UI}. I was not at all disappointed, and left with even more confidence than
before.

@{B}S.A.C.C.@{UB} did a good job, this was their first show. There were some hitches here
and  there,  but  nothing insurmountable. And they worked hard to make it right,
and extremely upset and disappointed when they couldn't.

Despite  the sometimes flaring egos and tempers, we thank you @{B}S.A.C.C.@{UB} for bring
a  show  to  the western half of the states! Special thanks should go to @{I}Michael
Salcedo@{UI},  @{I}John  Zacharias@{UI},  and @{I}Alan Crandall@{UI}. Thank you for your understanding,
patience, and help.

I'll  be  working  with  @{I}Bill  Borsari@{UI}  and @{I}Casey Halverson@{UI} on some exciting new
projects  for  the @{B}MAE@{UB} (Ohio) show in October. We have some great things for you
internet show watchers. Keep your eyes peeled for press releases and news as the
show gets closer.

Thanks for your attention.

@{I}BILL MCEWEN@{UI} REVEALS THE @{B}AMIGA INC@{UB} PLAN FROM A MARKETING PERSPECTIVE
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Although  my  first  @{B}AmiWest@{UB} report was well received, I know it was lacking the
most important information. What did @{B}Amiga, Inc.@{UB} have to say? More specifically,
what happened to @{I}Schindler@{UI}, @{I}Havemose@{UI}, and @{I}McEwen@{UI}?

I'll start with @{I}Bill McEwen@{UI}.

I apologize for not posting this earlier, but I had to review the video tapes so
that I could hit upon the highlights so as to avoid a long and drawn out post.

@{I}Bill  McEwen@{UI} is definitely a professional in marketing. He understands the basic
principles,  and  has  a  great  deal  of  knowledge  beyond  those  basics from
experience. He knows things you simply cannot learn in school.

On Saturday evening, July 11th, at the Banquet speech, @{I}Bill McEwen@{UI} elaborated on
the  @{B}Amiga, Inc.@{UB} plans from the marketing perspective. He had a clear outline of
the path they'd like to take. I will not cover the entire presentation, only the
new items.

The news that we had all been waiting for was the revelation of the now infamous
@{B}"MMC"@{UB}.  I  have  no  such  news,  because  Mr.  @{I}McEwen@{UI} had no such news. He did,
however, have the minimum acceptable specification for the @{B}"MMC"@{UB}.

First the market statistics that motivate decisions in @{B}Amiga@{UB} Marketing:

@{I}Desktop OS Market@{UI}
                   1997-1998        2000 (projected)
@{B}Windows 95@{UB}/@{B}98@{UB}        69.4          65.0
@{B}Windows NT@{UB}            9.2          26.2
@{B}DOS@{UB}/@{B}Windows 3.x@{UB}       7.7           0.3
@{B}MacOS@{UB}                 4.6           1.9
@{B}Linux@{UB}                 2.4           4.2
@{B}DOS@{UB} (no @{B}Windows@{UB})      2.3           0.3
@{B}UNIX@{UB}                  1.0           0.5
@{B}OS/2 Warp@{UB}             0.8           1.2
**Other               2.7           0.5

Other includes @{B}BeOS@{UB} and @{B}Amiga@{UB}

It  is  obvious  that  our  target  market  cannot  be the same target market as
@{B}Microsoft@{UB}'s.  And,  according  to @{I}Bill@{UI}, the @{B}Amiga@{UB} must do in 1999 what it did in
1985 -- it must hit the market with an attention getting *BANG* that makes folks
think, @{I}"WOW! I have got to get me one of these!"@{UI}

The new @{B}Amiga@{UB} must fall within these loose specification:
 * @{I}Video & Sound@{UI}
    - Real-time 3D rendering engine with 2D primitives
    - HDTV
       ~ Up to 1920x1080
    - RGB, PAL & NTSC encodings
    - Multiple simultaneous MPEG-II decoding
    - Hardware filtering scaling, color space conversions, de-interlacing
    - Dolby AC-3

 * @{I}Multimedia / RISC System@{UI}
    - Scalable through multiple multimedia processors (like the @{B}Classic Amiga@{UB})
    - 56k modem (minimum)
    - @{B}PCI@{UB} Controller
    - Rich development environment - @{B}C++@{UB}, @{B}Assembler@{UB}, debugger, linker, etc.
    - Native @{B}Java VM@{UB}

 * @{I}CHIP SPECIFICATIONS@{UI}
    - 400 million textured, bit-mapped pixels per second. With 24-bit per pixel,
      this corresponds to 1.2GB/s of output from the 3D engine.
    - Comparison: @{B}ECS Amiga@{UB} has ~8M/sec max access to chip memory
    - @{B}A4000@{UB}/@{B}A1200@{UB}  systems  have maximum access of ~32M/sec to chip memory (Chip
      memory is where graphics and audio data resides)
    - 4 simultaneous MPEG-II decoders

The path that @{B}Amiga, Inc.@{UB} would like to follow is:
[ Taken directly from the presentation slides ]

 * @{I}Gaming@{UI}
    - Imagination is the only limitation for this platform
    [ This  where  the  money  is, and really what the vast majority of computer
    users want from their computers ]

 * @{I}Internet@{UI}
    - Connected to people, entertainment & information
    [ Easy connection to internet. Complete integration ]

 * @{I}Digital Media and Broadcast@{UI}
    - Digitized Realism
    - Expression of the imagination

 * @{I}Electronic Paradigm Shift@{UI}
    - Digital appliances prolific
    - Consumer Electronics and Computers converging
    [ Other  companies  are  trying  this  now,  but  all  are  going  their own
      direction. @{B}Amiga@{UB} can close this gap. ]

 * @{I}@{B}Amiga@{UB} Virtues@{UI}:
    - @{B}Exec@{UB} - best micro kernel in 1985
    - STILL the best now
    - Fully Pre-emptive

 * @{I}For new systems we need@{UI}:
    - Memory protection
    - Virtual memory
    - Multi-processor
    - Real-time
    [ @{I}Bill@{UI} points out that these are the goals for the new system ]

 * @{I}Custom API's made the @{B}Amiga@{UB} small, fast and efficient@{UI}
    - Need @{B}OpenGL@{UB}
    - Need @{B}Java@{UB}
    - Need Internet
    - Need Convergence API's

    [ @{I}Bill@{UI} commented that this is a very important issue to Dr. @{I}Havemose@{UI} ]

@{I}Other points of interest:@{UI}

@{I}McEwen@{UI} stresses that the new @{B}Amiga@{UB} has to stand out from the crowd. Pointing out
that  current  @{B}PC@{UB}  options are intimidating, not easy to use, expensive, and are
often  obsolete  shortly  after  their release. This causes a great burden on an
already weary @{B}PC@{UB} purchasing public. The goals they have set forth will lead to a
personal computer where "personal" again has meaning.

This  has always been a strong point of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. @{I}McEwen@{UI} mentions he's not from
this  camp [@{B}Amiga@{UB}], but he sees a community. He stated in his presentation that,
@{I}"@{B}Gateway@{UB}  didn't  have  this  big plan for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. What they thought they had
were  patents  and  trademarks,  they  didn't  know  that  all of you [the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community]  came  with  it."@{UI} The room broke with laughter. Indeed, @{B}Gateway@{UB} could
not  have expected such a resounding response from what was thought to be a dead
platform.

I  believe  they see us now, and not as a burden, but an asset. So, for those of
you  that  have  any doubts about their sincerity, give them a chance. Hear them
out. I know you will be as surprised as I was by their dedication.

All   of  the  bulleted  text  above  was  taken  from  the  slides  during  the
presentation.  Mr. @{I}McEwen@{UI} promised the bulk of them will be posted on the @{B}Amiga,
Inc.@{UB} site.

---

Now, on to the "issues" that seemed to infuriate so many in the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community.

What  happened to @{I}Schindler@{UI}? Did his wife give birth to a bouncing baby boy? Did
Dr. @{I}Havemose@{UI} deliver their child?

Needless to say, these rumors were unfounded... and just plain silly. First, Dr.
@{I}Havemose@{UI}  is not a medical doctor. Second, if @{I}Jeff@{UI}'s wife is pregnant, it's news
to he and his wife.

What happened to Dr. @{I}Havemose@{UI} then?

I'll  answer  that  in  one  sentence: More contract negotiations required their
further  attention  which distracted them from less pressing issues, like shows.
I'd rather have them there working, than at a show playing.

So,  to  clarify,  @{I}Jeff  Schindler@{UI}  and  @{I}Allan  Havemose@{UI} were not able to attend
@{B}AmiWest@{UB} because they had @{B}Amiga@{UB} business to attend to.

Thank you for your attention.

INTERVIEW WITH @{B}VULCAN@{UB}'S @{B}MARBLE-EYES DEVELOPMENT@{UB} TEAM
----------------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

@{I}Q:  I  remember  downloading  a  preview  of @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} from @{B}Aminet@{UB} made by
@{B}Ambrosia@{UB} and now you are called @{B}Marble-Eyes@{UB} what has happened?@{UI}
@{B}MeD:@{UB}  Our  full name is @{B}Marble-Eyes Development@{UB}. Our game started as a good demo
effect, but at this point our coder was more or less alone on this project and a
member  of  the  demogroup called @{B}Ambrosia@{UB}. The @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} engine was first
shown the @{B}Gathering 96@{UB} in Norway and got a lot of positive criticism. After this
event  the  other  members  in  @{B}Ambrosia@{UB}  seem  to  care  more  about other demo
productions,  and the coder was therefore forced into an alternative arrangement
of finding someone to do the job.
Finally  a  very  talented graphician reply an e-mail and process began to speed
up.  Later  on  @{I}Martin  Halberg@{UI} our audioman joined the team and our demo effect
began  to  look  a lot more like a game. We all decided to leave behind the demo
scene  and concentrate on game development, therefore it seem natural to restart
under a new name.

@{I}Q: When did Vulcan Software get into the picture?@{UI}
@{B}MeD:@{UB}  The demo from the @{B}Gathering 96@{UB} was put on @{B}Aminet@{UB} and downloaded by @{B}Vulcan@{UB}.
They  liked  it  and  saw  potential  in it's concept so they contacted us and a
contract was signed on 1st of December 1996.

@{I}Q: Try to describe @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} using 50 words.@{UI}
@{B}MeD:@{UB} Based on @{B}Paradroid@{UB} this game offers furiously invigorating and thrilling 3d
action  with  an amount of details not seen on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} for along time. Lots of
puzzles,  atmosphere  and  gameplay. 200 MB intro animation, 30 mins of CD music
and 29000 lines of optimised @{B}68k@{UB} assembler.

@{I}Q:  46  words  that's  close  ;).  The @{B}Amiga@{UB} has seen many @{B}Doom@{UB} clones, is there
anything new about your game?@{UI}
@{B}MeD:@{UB} The speed, the playability, the atmosphere and support for everything worth
a  mention.  Not at least your unique ability (and need) to take over the bodies
of  humans,  cyborgs  and  droids,  which  has  proven to work very well in a 3d
environment. We believe it is unfair to call @{B}GS@{UB} for a @{B}Doom@{UB} clone. In fact we use
the  3d  environment  as a platform to build an adventure game. Imagine the year
2034  you  startup your big virtual reality machine and enters a cyberspace with
no boundaries. Would you say: "awesome @{B}Doom@{UB} clone man!"

@{I}Q: Why do you think @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} is better than other 3d games?@{UI}
@{B}MeD:@{UB}  @{B}GS@{UB}  features  a  original  plot  that  is well combined with the story and
gameplay.  The  plot  in  the  game  is  not just for decoration. Once you start
playing  a  weak  and  twisted story line begins to unfold. Shooting every thing
that moves will get you nowhere and that gives @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} the edge.

@{I}Q: Tell us a secret no one outside @{B}Marble-Eyes@{UB} knows!@{UI}
@{B}MeD:@{UB}  We  are  aliens  from Alpha Centauri and have made plans to rule the world
before the millennium.

@{I}Q: What can we expect from @{B}Marble-Eyes@{UB} in the future?@{UI}
@{B}MeD:@{UB}  Well, we are here to stay! Our motivation and passion for computer science
continues  and  we have big plans for @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} before we start on another
game.  First  up is a multiplayer AddOn with TCP/IP support. This means that you
will  be  able  to  play  over  the internet. We hope to create the first useful
internet  game  for  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB},  if not Mr. @{I}Burkey@{UI} beats us there. However this
multiplayer  AddOns  will  be  infected  with  all  sort  of  pirate protections
something  we  didn't have time to do on the CD-ROM. With 4 years of demo coding
experience and reverse engineering of demos I should be able to give the cracker
and good headache and at the time this AddOn is cracked a new one is out.

@{I}Q: Speaking of piracy. How is Genetic Species doing?@{UI}
@{B}MeD:@{UB} We haven't done anything to prevent piracy yet, but the size of the game is
more  than  600  MB  which  makes a natural limit for BBS/Internet piracy. Still
there  are jerks out there who rather will spent two days online than to support
the  future  of  the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. However most people are supporting an @{B}Amiga@{UB} specific
game. An issue our sales at the @{B}WOA@{UB} show outlined in style!

Live Long & Prosper!

RUMOR CONTROL FROM @{I}BILL MCEWEN@{UI}, HEAD OF MARKETING
-------------------------------------------------

August 26,1998

Greetings:

I  want  to  thank  all  of you who have contacted me in the last couple of days
about  some  new  rumors  that  are  spreading  through our community. As I have
mentioned  before if you have any questions please do not hesitate in contacting
any of us listed at the end of this message.

Here are the rumors that are circulating this week:

 * @{I}The new @{B}Amiga@{UB} will be based on the @{B}Intel Merced@{UB} chip.@{UI}
   WRONG!  I  want  to  make  this perfectly clear. The next generation of @{B}Amiga@{UB}
   machines  that  run  @{B}OS 5.0@{UB} will typically be media-processor based. The last
   time I checked @{B}Intel@{UB} didn't have one of these.

 * @{I}Fleecy and I are dating.@{UI}
   I will answer this one later.

 * @{I}The @{B}BeOS@{UB} is the OS partner, and they are what everyone should develop to.@{UI}
   WRONG!  Please  do not jump at every rumor. As mentioned before, @{B}Be@{UB} is ONE of
   the OS partners that we are considering. There are at least 6 others that are
   on the list. We have narrowed the contenders, and we hope to have all of this
   wrapped up soon.

 * @{I}Amiga  has  no  plans for the high end of the platform, and will not have any
   support for NewTek.@{UI}
   WRONG!  Keys  to  our  success  are  the ability of the next generation @{B}Amiga@{UB}
   architecture  to  be  scaleable and work well as a home computer and the high
   end with the @{B}Toaster@{UB} and @{B}Flyer@{UB}.

 * @{I}@{B}Amiga@{UB}  does not care about the @{B}QuikPak@{UB} situation, and does not care about the
   @{B}4000@{UB} shortage.@{UI}
   WRONG!  We are doing all that we can in helping this process come to a close.
   The  legal  problems  are  between  @{B}QuikPak@{UB} and @{I}Hembach@{UI}. These legal problems
   started  before  @{B}Gateway@{UB} ever purchased @{B}Amiga@{UB}. We hope and pray that this can
   be resolved quickly also.

 * @{I}Jeff and I are dating.@{UI}
   WRONG! It would make @{I}Fleecy@{UI} jealous.

 * @{I}@{B}OS 3.5@{UB} is back and in development.@{UI}
   We  are currently evaluating the market needs for an OS upgrade before @{B}OS 5.0@{UB}
   ships.  No  decision has been made. As soon as we have all of our information
   gathered, we will make the final decision and let everyone know.

 * @{I}@{B}Amiga Classic@{UB} is only for those machines compatible with @{B}OS 4.0@{UB}.@{UI}
   WRONG!  The  @{B}Amiga  Classic@{UB}  line  is  for the applications and hardware that
   currently run @{B}OS 3.1@{UB}. If it runs @{B}3.1@{UB} then it is in the @{B}Classic@{UB} series.

 * @{I}The  new  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  architecture  will  not be compatible with the current @{B}Amiga@{UB}
   applications@{UI}.
   We  plan  to  have  hardware  and  software  compatibility  for the developer
   platform and software emulation for @{B}OS 5.0@{UB}.

I  hope  that  this helps in dispelling some of the rumors. I am sure that there
are  more,  and  once I receive a rumor from more than a few people, we will get
the answers up as quickly as possible.

Thank  you again, and I look forward to seeing many of you in Columbus, and then
Cologne.

Keeping the faith,

@node art06 "AMIGA & CU AMIGA - THE WHOLE STORY!"

@{B}AMIGA@{UB} & @{B}CU AMIGA@{UB} - THE WHOLE STORY!
-----------------------------------

This is an article from @{I}Mikey Carrillo@{UI} regarding the closure of @{B}CU Amiga@{UB}.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fellow @{B}Amiga@{UB}ns.

Foreword:  Before  you  read  this  I  would  like to state that the information
contained  within  this  posting  is  as  accurately  truthful as possible and I
consider my sources to be honest and true.

In  short,  unless  later  stated different the information that follows is 100%
accurate.

Whilst the news of the closure of @{B}CU-Amiga@{UB} has hit us all very badly, all is not
as it seems and the news is actually very positive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{B}CU-AMIGA@{UB}.  Whilst @{B}CU-Amiga@{UB} was actually the biggest selling @{B}Amiga@{UB} magazine, (60%
market  share)  it  wasn't the most profitable. (more on that soon) Basically in
the  recent  months  @{B}CU-Amiga@{UB} dipped slightly below profitability twice and @{B}EMAP@{UB}
publishing  decided  to pull the plug rather than to try to see if it could turn
it's fortunes around.

Bear  in mind that @{B}Emap@{UB} is mainly a women's magazine publisher it only has three
computing titles, @{B}CU-Amiga@{UB}, @{B}Playstation@{UB} and an Internet magazine. It may be also
said  that  with  only three computing titles they are looking to get out of the
computing  market  altogether  and  that  @{B}CU-Amiga@{UB}  may  be  the  first  of  the
'casualties' - although this is mere speculation on my part.

The  @{B}CU-Amiga@{UB} staff, are now sadly without employment (no where in @{B}Emap@{UB} for them
to go.) I hope someone else picks them up - They are amigans through and through.

Also bear in mind that @{B}Emap@{UB} is in business like any other publisher and may have
decided that they have to show the shareholders that they were determined to not
waste any of their money on a floundering title.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{B}AMIGA  FORMAT@{UB} the second biggest selling @{B}Amiga@{UB} title of the two with only 40% of
the  market.  Published  by  @{B}Future  Publishing@{UB}  whom  publish 16 other computer
magazines.  @{B}Amiga Format@{UB} is Trading in PROFIT!!! Of the 16 computing titles that
@{B}Future@{UB} publish @{B}Amiga Format@{UB} is well above Several of them in profitability.

The  Management of @{B}Amiga Format@{UB} have assured @{B}Amiga Format@{UB} that they have got the
go ahead for another year of publishing. They are also quite confident that they
will be able to extend this. Hopefully to see in the New @{B}Amiga@{UB} and beyond.

As  a  result  of  @{B}CU-Amiga@{UB}s  closure, there has been an increase of Advertising
revenue  at  @{B}Amiga  Format@{UB}  and  this  will lead to the INCREASE of pages in the
magazine. (From about 108 now, to 124 or 130 pages) These will be made up from a
mixture of extra advertising and extra features/articles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I  have  also  taken  the  liberty  this  afternoon of speaking to the key @{B}Amiga@{UB}
Players  in  the  UK  from developers, publishers and retailers here's what they
said. (Note it makes very positive reading):

 * @{B}Active  Technologies@{UB}:  @{I}"Yes,  we  are  continuing  on  the @{B}Amiga@{UB} and are also
   developing new software to be unveiled at @{B}Cologne'98@{UB}"@{UI}
 * @{B}Alive  Mediasoft@{UB}: @{I}"We are staying. @{B}Alive Mediasoft@{UB} is EXPANDING we are taking
   people  on and we will be the LAST People standing on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} if Necessary.
   We are committed to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} 100%"@{UI}
 * @{B}Blittersoft@{UB}: @{I}"Business as usual - we will carry on supporting the @{B}Amiga@{UB}"@{UI}
 * @{B}Chroma@{UB}: @{I}"Yes, we will continue supporting the @{B}Amiga@{UB} for the time being"@{UI}
 * @{B}Epic  Marketing@{UB}:  @{I}"We  are staying with the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Platform, We are increasing
   our Advertising in @{B}Amiga Format@{UB} and will be producing more advertising flyers"@{UI}
 * @{B}Eyetech@{UB}: @{I}"Absolutely continuing to support the @{B}Amiga@{UB} - No question."@{UI}
 * @{B}Fore-Matt  Home  computing@{UB}:  @{I}"We  will continue supporting the @{B}Amiga@{UB} and very
   much  so.  we  are increasing our advertising revenue on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} and we are
   committed to it the @{B}Amiga@{UB} 100%"@{UI}
 * @{B}Power  Computing@{UB}: @{I}"We will continue to support the @{B}Amiga@{UB}, it remains the most
   profitable platform in our product range making up 70% of our income. We have
   also recently increased our advertising budget as well"@{UI}
 * @{B}White  Knight  Technologies@{UB}:  @{I}"No  change  for  us we remain committed to the
   @{B}Amiga@{UB} Platform but we will be increasing our direct mailings to our customers
   and also increase our DTV business"@{UI}
 * @{B}Weird Science@{UB}: @{I}"Debating"@{UI} (but I think they will stay)
 * @{B}Wizard Developments@{UB}: @{I}"No change - business as usual"@{UI}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There  you  have it, take this and publish it anywhere were you think it will be
useful.

Tell  people  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  is  not  dead,  all the people I have spoken were very
positive about the @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s future.

While  a  lot  of people may point their finger and say that @{I}"But yes they would
say  that wouldn't they"@{UI} let me say that I have gotten to know some of them over
the  years,  and  I  didn't tell all of them I was doing this article - they all
appeared  very  genuine  in  their  replies  - Remember most of these people are
@{B}Amiga@{UB}ns and they are going to stick with the @{B}Amiga@{UB} through thick and thin.

An  Excellent  Magazine  has  gone  but it's not the @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s Fault, After all if
@{B}Amiga  Format@{UB} (with less circulation can be profitable) then you have to look at
the way @{B}CU-Amiga@{UB} was being distributed.

Perhaps,  if  the  magazine was as easy to find in the shops as @{B}AF@{UB}, they may not
have had to go..

    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
At  this  moment,  I can not promise anything yet, mainly because there are some
internal problems which has to be solved. If @{B}Samba World Cup@{UB} and @{B}Eat the Whistle@{UB}
are released in time, Football will be the main topic of the next issue.

Anyway, the following is only a guess:
    o The most important news of the latest months.
    o More monthly news.
    o An exclusive interview (if I recieve a positive answer)
    o Review of the next generation of football games on the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.
    o @{B}SWOS@{UB} editors.
    o and much more.

So, be patient and don't miss the next issue on the 15th October of:
