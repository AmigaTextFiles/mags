PowerWB improves the good (??) old (!!) standard Workbench of the Amiga a
little bit. I know there are more and more Workbench replacements coming
out, these days. Some of them are really good but anyway not everybody
of us will stop using the standard Workbench, whatever the reasons might
be (too much memory usage, incompatibility, too expensive, too slow etc.)

PowerWB adds the following new features to the Workbench:

- Two new gadgets will be added to the titlebar of the workbench windows.
  One to switch the "View by" mode ("Icon" / "Name") and the other to switch
  the "Show" mode ("Only Icons" / "All Files")

- PowerWB allows you to use the keyboard for some operations which normally
  can only be done by accessing the menu or the gadgets.

@{FG SHINE}PowerWB should work on any machine with at least AmigaOS 2.0 if the menu
layout (position of the items) is exactly the same as in Workbench 3.0!@{FG TEXT}

I don't know whether the menu items are at the same position in each version
of the operating system (starting from 2.0). Therefore the only Workbench
version that is guaranteed to be "compatible" with PowerWB is 3.0!! If the
menu layout of your Workbench is not exactly like @{" Menu.iff " LINK "images/Menu.iff/main"}, then PowerWB
might create big trouble or do some very strange (and dangerous) things.
Contact me if this is the case. I will try to make PowerWB compatible with
your Workbench version (don't forget to tell me the @{B}exact@{UB} menu layout of
your Workbench!)

PowerWB is @{FG SHINE}Shareware@{FG TEXT}. You can do some days or weeks of testings but if
you keep using it you have to send me some money. Everything from 2000 Lire
(2 DM, 1 US$) upto 5000 Lire (5 DM, 3 US$) is ok. If possible please do not
send me the money in any other currency. I might eventually accept also a
gift instead of the money, but ask me first (EMail)!!! Send everything to:

@{B}Warning:@{UB}

I cannot be held responsible for any damage that might occure when using
PowerWB!!!
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Installation" "Installation"
@TOC "Main"
To test PowerWB you don't have to install it, just start it from a Shell
(see @{" Usage " LINK "Usage"})

To install PowerWB permanently on your computer either use the supplied
Installer script (double-click the Install icon) or do the following:

1) Copy PowerWB anywhere you like. I suggest you to copy it either to
   "SYS:c" or "SYS:utilities".

2) Add the following line to your "s:user-startup"

	run <>NIL: <path>PowerWB

   <path> must be replaced with the directory where you have copied PowerWB!
   So the real line will look like one of this:

	run <>NIL: SYS:c/PowerWB

	run <>NIL: SYS:utilities/PowerWB

   If you want to change/disable some of PowerWB's options have a look
   at @{" Usage " LINK "Usage"} and change the start line accordingly!

PowerWB can (actually) only be used from a CLI/Shell (or started as a CLI/
Shell program). It has the following argument template:

	      @{FG SHINE}CX_PRIORITY/N/K,NOGADGETS/S,NOKEYS/S@{FG TEXT}

CX_PRIORITY: Commodity priority. Normally you should not have to change
             this value, which by default is 0, but if PowerWB does not
             work correctly (shortcuts don't work, etc.) or causes trouble
             with other commodities you can try changing this value which
             must be in a range between -128 and 127.

NOGADGETS  : If you specify this keyword, then the two additional gadgets in
	     the titlebar of Workbench windows will not appear.

NOKEYS     : By specifying this keyword, no advanced keyboard control will
	     be available in Workbench windows.

@{B}The new gadgets in the titlebar do the following:@{UB}

- The first (leftmost) one allows you to switch between "View by Icon" and
  "View by Name" mode. 
  
- The second one allows you to switch between "Show Only Icons" and "Show
  all Files" mode.


@{B}And these are the keys that can now be used in Workbench drawer windows:@{UB}

@{FG SHINE}CURSOR KEYS@{FG TEXT}   Scroll content of window (behaves like clicking on the small
              arrow gadgets in the lower right corner of the window). By
              holding down SHIFT scrolling will be done by pixel.

To quit PowerWB send it a break (CTRL C) or use the "Remove" button in Ex-
change. Quitting might eventually fail (screen flashes) if it was not
possible to remove the patches, PowerWB installs. This happens if one or
more programs have patched one or more system functions that were already
patched by PowerWB.

PowerWB can be temporary disabled by using the "Active/Inactive" button in
Exchange. When you set PowerWB to inactive the extra gadgets in the title-
bar of the workbench windows will be removed. By setting PowerWB to active
again, the extra gadgets will be added to the already open Workbench windows
automatically.

- When you scroll the content of Workbench windows with the cursor keys
  scrolling sometimes does not stop. If this happens activate another
  window or press one of the cursor keys again.
  
- When you scroll the content of Workbench windows with the cursor keys
  the arrow gadgets sometimes do not get unselected, after having released
  the cursor key (I have to select/unselect the arrow gadget, otherwise
  scrolling with the keyboard does not work)

- The extra gadgets in the titlebar of Workbench windows look ugly,
  especially if the font's height on the Workbench screen is smaller than
  13 :( You can send me some images about how you would like them to be. I
  might eventually add external routine support to allow changing the look
  of the extra gadgets (just like in PowerWindows)

- Maybe some more shortcuts 

- Maybe make the shortcuts configurable

- Maybe a prefs program

- Maybe wait for some money from you, first ;-)

- Send me your ideas

- I don't want the program to become too big. If you want something really
  cool get Scalos, Directory Opus, MBench or something like that. PowerWB
  is mainly intended for those who don't have enough memory or money - like
  me :(

This little commodity removes the border around the Icons when you drag

the Icons but not when you dragged them.

@{FG SHINE}@{B}WBAttack (Freeware):@{UB}@{FG TEXT}

WBAttack is a little program which allows you to change the backdrop mode
of the main Workbench window. It is (mainly) intended to be used with pro-
grams like Toolmanager which allow starting programs with a configurable
hotkey. As such hotkeys can be used in any occasion (it does not matter
which window or screen is the active one) accessing the icons of the main
Workbench window (by switching the Workbench backdrop mode off, which brings
the Workbench window automatically to front) will be very very easy.
