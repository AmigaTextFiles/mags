I know what you are thinking ... &quot;Wait a minute?  How many times are we
going to read about this program this year?  Just in the Dispatch alone?&quot;
Well, I understand the frustration.  Fact of the matter, we have never
gotten to see how this game PLAYS;  just the rolling non-playable demo.  I
decided to go ahead and review it again now that there is more info AND I
have gotten to play a level of this kick ass game.<P>

For those of you who just got rescued off of Gilligan's Island or something,
<B>AB3D</B> is<I> Team 17</I>'s entry into the Amiga 'Doom Clone' market.  Right now, the
market seems to be expanding at a gruesome rate (considering I didn't really
care for the gendre - and still don't) with no less than four companies
announcing actual commercial releases of these first person perspective (oh,
did I forget 'virtual reality' - knock it off) games.<P>

The rolling preview really got people talking about AB3D.  Die hard DOOM
fans bitched about the chunkyness of the pixels claiming that PD demo
engines were much better (yeah, but where are the monsters?  The doors and
elevators in those engines, eh?).  IMHO, the fact that they made that decent
of a translation using copper and blitter tricks on a 14 mhz Amiga was
amazing to this gamer.  But, everyone just complained about the demo and
looked toward TextDemo and such for solace.  Now, everything is different.<P>

We now have some real release data on AB3D and I have gotten to actually
PLAY this cool engine.  Now let me fill you in.<P>

First, over 20 levels of super-smooth, 360 degree 3D movement - no jerks, no
45-degree only turns.  Full rotational character movement without sporadic
jumping.  The graphics are fully texture mapped and Gouraud shaded (yes!).
The enemies consist of aliens and a host of grisly bad guys.  The
intelligence is being worked on hard so that enemies won't just aimlessly
walk around;  they will hear you and seek you out through sound.  Two
players cooperative (and death match type play) will be achievable through a
null modem cable/serial link (modem play please!).  Best of all, T17 says
that you will NOT have to buy two copies of the game to play two players;
backing up of the disks will be available immediately on purchase (um, does
this mean we get a HD installable version?).  Nice to see someone breaking
the norm for a change.<P>

A full screen environment will envelope the character.  The cool backround
throbbing and atmospheric type effects used in other Breed games are present
in AB3D and it is reputedly ber 'John Crapenter-like' (I love it already).<P>

&quot;Real-time inverse kinematic objects&quot; ('buzz phrase' I wonder?) will also be
present which means the creatures in the game act totally independant and
realistically, as if in real-life. Music and sound effects are being
provided by that good old chap Allister Brimble and we all know what a great
job he does of making up feel 'right at home' during our gaming.<P>

Enough specs. Now let me convey what it feels like to actually PLAY this new
hot game.  <P>

Feels like DOOM.  Plays like DOOM.  Even kinda looks like DOOM.  Those who
know me know that I am not a big fan of the gendre, *BUT* I am a huge fan of
the Alien Breed series.  Folks, what these geniuses have done on a 14 mhz
machine will astound you.  You would have to play DOOM on a 486DX2/66 to get
this kind of smooth clean gameplay.  DOOM didn't have the atmosphere; that
brooding music - you know, like Jack Nicholson was going to pop out from
behind the next corner with an axe like in THE SHINING screaming
&quot;HEEEEEEEERE'S JOHNNY!&quot; and burying it in your chest.  (Nice mental image,
eh?)<P>

The fact of the matter is that this is a highly playable game.  Sure, it is
a bit more chunky than others of its class, but I will tell you what.  It
more than makes up for it in other aspects.<P>

First, the monsters are better than most I have seen.  They don't pixelize
really bad when you get close.  The screams they make are cool.  Like
DUNGEON MASTER, you can HEAR them coming.  Their footsteps echo behind you
as you run off.  Very nice.  There are only two types I have seen;  the
green aliens that scream when they die and the totally killer 'walker' type
creatures (that are not killable in the demo version).  Man, they did a
sweet job with this enemy.  His movements are super smooth, and detailed.  I
mean, you can read the thing's serial number.  They are pretty smart and
follow you around like they should.<P>

The demo also shows the multi-level capabilities.  There are lots of stairs,
platforms, sunk in ground, etc.  There are some REALLY nice elevator effects
too.<P>

Your traditional doors are there, along with switches and such on the walls
for your interaction, too.  The standard boxes of ammo, medkits, etc. are
abound.<P>

The coolest part of this game that even DOOM doesn't have is the water.  My
god, was I ever impressed.  The water is not only reflective, but refractive
too.  You see reflections on the surface, as well as the distortions of the
items under the water.  Even better, the water is variable leveled;  that's
right.  You can be wading in water up to your chest!  And finally, the water
actually rushes by you at times like a river.  Totally killer.  Nice job.<P>

At the time of writing, I still had not finished the preview level but will
keep chugging on it.  This is a remarkable piece of work and everyone, even
if you are NOT a DOOM-type game fan, should check this out.  You might be
pleasantly surprised.<P>

'Tis the season for DOOM clones I guess.  Here is yet another entry in the
growing list of DOOM style clones.  This one is a bit different for a
change, and definately has some strong points.  To give you my first
impression, I thought it totally kicked butt!<P>

First off, the game is more like Wolfenstein 3D versus DOOM since it is a
bit more pixely and doesn't have the stairs, elevators, etc. that the DOOM
clones tend to have.  The doors all seem to open automatically (most people
are saying how much they dislike this) so that is one less thing to distract
you from the main goal of the game:  killing.<P>

The demo version floating around allows you to set the detail and screen
size of the game based on your processor and on the 040/25 you got about 1/4
screen (only slightly smaller for my 020/14). The detail change is actually
pretty dramatic.  You may also elect to have floors and ceiling graphics on
or off for more speed.  The coolest thing about the demo is that the two
player mode is already in place and you can play cooperative or the infamous
&quot;death match&quot; mode.  Unlike Death Mask or AB3D, the two player mode is split
screen with the playing screens on the top and bottom versus DM's side by
side or AB3D's null modem play.  There should be null/modem play in GLOOM's
final release.  Even if there isn't, the two player mode is great.<P>

Sound like I am a bit more enthusiastic about GLOOM versus AB3D?  Well, I
am;  and I will tell you why.  GLOOM has some traits about it that I think
are just kick butt.  While AB3D will appeal more to the die hard DOOM fans
with its Gourard Shading, smooth reflective water, etc. GLOOM will appeal to
those who are into the basics of the game:  death.  What's more, it does it
with STYLE.  On the other DOOM style games, when you kill an enemy, they may
scream and fall to the ground (some even keep bleeding), BUT in GLOOM in
either of the modes (MESSY is my favorite) has your enemies not only
screaming (heh heh heh) but also have their bodies exploding into dozens of
pieces, usually littering the ground with carnage.  There is very little
more satisfying that charging down a corridor filled with enemy and shooting
them and finding yourself in a rain shower of body parts.<P>

Weaponry is handled a bit different.  You pick up little fists and your
'weapon meter' grows.  As you shoot, your meter decreases.  Your meter is
graduated in increments; each increment represents an increase in weapon
power.  Drop below the increment, you go to the next lesser weapon.  Tell
you what;  when you peg that puppy out, get ready for some serious death.
'One shot kills all' type thing.  Its great.<P>

There are some great extras in the game that I haven't seen in any
(including the actual) incarnation of DOOM.  Extra hardware such as a
thermal imager which allows you to see through walls!  Heh heh heh.  Now you
can look through the doors and see what really awaits you on the other side.
A very nice touch.  Hopefully the final release will have even more goodies
like that.<P>

I have to admit, I liked this one better than AB3D, but each has theirown
strong and weak points.  Myself, I am going to have to buy both.  The creepy
atmospheric play of AB3D is really cool (as are the Walkers) but GLOOM
satisfies my undying need to see the enemy turned into Gaines burger dog
food.  Those of you who follow the newsletters know what a bloodthirsty
kinda guy I am (I mean Roadkill is still my favorite game) so if you find
that our tastes are the same, you will certainly not be disappointed.<P>

Both of these demo versions are available on Aminet at FTP site:
ftp.netnet.net and many people have them in their own home FTPs.  You could
also get these from just about anyone hanging out in the IRC's if you have
DCC capabilities.  Try IRC server irc.virginia.edu 6667 on the #AMIGA
channel and just ask.  heh heh.  Here's to happy blasting.
