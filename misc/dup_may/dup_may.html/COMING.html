                          COMING ATTRACTIONS <PRE>

</PRE>
With the buyout war finally finished, I have a feeling this section is going
to grow quite quickly in the future.  Until the mad race of developers
starts, I will go ahead and give you all the latest gossip, new releases,
and basic talk floating around.  Most of this is factual, but some of it is
heresay so don't quote me on any of it.  If something seems exceptionally
hard to swallow, or I know is just a passing rumor, I will indicate it so.<P>

... Microprose announced it will be porting over its popular games
COLONIZATION and PIZZA TYCOON for the Amiga.  No word yet on the platform
but I suspect that at least the initial release will be AGA only.  I am not
holding my breath for a CD32 version.<P>

... UFO: TERRORS OF THE DEEP is -not- schedualed for release on the Amiga,
but now that the buyout is completed, maybe that will change.  I would
certainly expect it to be AGA only - and certainly no CD32 version.<P>

... Speaking of UFO, those awaiting an ECS version will have to wait no
longer.  It is shipping in Europe and we should see it on these shores soon.
For those of you with bare A1200's or CD32/SX1's, this might be a good way
to get a little bit more speed out of the game.  If you haven't already
bought the game, you might want to hold off and see how much difference
there is.  The speed trade off might be worth it.<P>

... September marks the month that PRIMAL RAGE will be released on the CD32
and assumably the Amiga AGA platform.  God, death games rule.  With this hit
arcade game in my collection, I may never get anything done.<P>

... Did I fail to mention last issue that Super Street Fighter II is being
ported?  Yee haw.  Hope it is dramatically better than SF II.<P>

... Arcane looks like there are going to give us yet another arcade advent-
ure game in the vein of Darkmere.  A new Finnish company is doing the code;
I only pray they are HALF as good as the Finnish Bloodhouse of Stardust
fame.<P>

... Gametek hasn't abandoned the Amiga.  Their hot game BRUTAL looks like it
is coming for the Amiga.  Looking forward to a CD32 version.<P>

... TFX is STILL coming.  For those still waiting, they are doing extensive
beta testing to make sure it is done 100% right for the Amiga.  CD32 version
as mentioned before, no no more, and future support of the Amiga will be
heavily weighted on sales of TFX, so go out and buy it damn it.  The release
of INFERNO is the next product to make it if we support TFX.<P>

... Bored of SETTLERS and LORDS OF THE REALMS yet?  A new strategy game is
coming from Gametek called BALDIES.  Looks just yummy.  Kinda looks like a
cross between Settlers and CIVILIZATION.<P>

... VIRTUAL RACING did well on the Sega Genesis and now we might get a crack
at something similar.  LEADING LAP will bring a VR meets HARD DRIVIN'. It is
being made in conjunction with a Virtual Reality company to enhance the
realism of the driving experience.<P>

... Shadow Fighters CD32 is out.  Just can't WAIT to get my grimey pause on
a copy.  Action galore.<P>

... Another trader game is coming for the Amiga.  A combination of DUNE II
and THE PATRICIAN, VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY is coming from Black Legend soon.<P>

... CRICKET?  AGAIN?  You have got to be kidding me...<P>

... Could a new image processor be sneaking up on the big guys?  Almathera
has been working on PHOTOGENICS.  This open ended image processer is one to
watch.  Keep an eye out for it.<P>

... U.S. Gold is looking good with a new golf game.  WORLD CUP GOLF is what
we have all been waiting for.  This CD32 game only will come on 2 CDs and
have all Silicon Graphics rendered backrounds and digitized shots of the
golf course.  LOOKIN' GREAT!
