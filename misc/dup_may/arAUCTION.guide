It hasn't been easy keeping a cheery disposition since April 29, 1994.

Now, the liquidation chapter of Commodore's existance is all but closed.

Barring an amazing development in the Bahamas Supreme Court, which has all
but promised to echo the decision of the US court, Escom AG will become
the owner of the assets of Commodore International.

What does this mean for us?  I don't know yet.  Early indications aren't
what I would call promising.  Out of the "big three" bidders, two were
never very far away...Alex Amor was always good to hold an online
conference, and David Pleasance could be counted on for a nice UK magazine
article whenever public lethargy warranted.

But Escom has done everything in its power to avoid Amiga users, has lied
to the press, and in general made itself unavailable.

With their manufacturing partners' locale and the clear, stated intent to
restart production of the Commodore 64 for the Chinese market, as well as
plans on the board for a Mac and PC clone under the Commodore name, where
can we possibly fit into Escom's plans?

That, of course, is largely up to Escom.  But there's no rule against
telling them how displeased you'd be if things don't go your way.

Unfortunately, contact with Escom isn't available to me at the moment.  As
soon as I know how to reliably get a hold of them-don't worry, you'll know
too.  And I STRONGLY suggest that we start to put the screws to them now,
before it's too late.

The Amiga's future was never guaranteed, not in 1985, not on April 29,
1994, and certainly not on April 21, 1995.  But I'll be damned if I'm
going to give up now.

Jason

PS- Any week now, print magazines will start hitting the shelves, bringing

===========================================================================

A quick breakdown, based on the best information available, of how
Thursday and Friday transpired-


Thursday: Auction Day

The liquidators declare that no bids with conditions will be attached will
be accepted.  Alex Amor of CEI does not submit his bid based on this
restriction.

Computer Connection of California submits a bid for the assets that is
rejected for lack of a $1 M deposit.

Dell Computers, a US-based clone manufacturer, submits a bid for the
assets that is rejected because a condition is attached.

Escom, holding the only valid bid, finds their original signed contract
for $5 million accepted.


Somewhere Thursday Night:

The C= UK MBO issues a statement formally withdrawing for the running,
citing the overwhelming resources of Escom and Dell.

Alex Amor and Dell form a coalition bid.  (It seems that Dell's primary
interest is in Commodore's patents, presumably to wage profitable lawsuits
with.  Alex Amor convinces them to combine bids, allowing him to rein over
the Amiga.)


Friday Morning: Court Date

The objections against the sale are heards.

The IBM and Netherlands Trustees (of Commodore BV/Philippines/UK)
objections are heard, but very little comes of them.

The C= US Creditor's objection is heard.  The result of this was unclear.

Dell offers $15 million for the assets.  The creditors, the liquidator,
Dell Computers, and Judge Garrity all seem to agree that, given the
unusual circumstances, a new auction should be held, perhaps on Tuesday.
Escom is not in agreement.


Friday, During Lunch:

Escom ups its bid to $10 million.


Friday Afternoon: Court

The creditors announce that Escom has increased its bid to $10 million,
which is acceptable to them.

The deal is approved.

[My sources indicate that Alex Amor and Dell disappeared fairly quickly
after lunch.]

==========================================================================

#auction of the day's proceedings. -Jason]


The News, as best as I can present it, as of 4-20-1995, about 10:00 PM
Eastern US time...


OK.  Today, the only valid bid presented to the liquidators was from
Escom.  Two other bids were presented.  One, from a California-based
dealer was rejected because they could not put up the necessary deposit.

The second, from Dell (PC-clone manufacturer) was rejected because it
dictated a 7-day investigation period on patents.   The liquidators ruled
that any and all conditions were unacceptable, which is why Alex Amor and
presumably David Pleasance did not bid. 

So, Escom's standing bid of $5 million was accepted.  NOW-Tommorow Judge
Garrity will be ruling on the objections to the sale.  In addition to the
objections from the C= US creditors, the liquidators of Commodore
BV/Philippines/Netherlands/UK, and IBM... 

He will ALSO have objections from Alex Amor, very probably from Dell, and
possibly from David Pleasance.  Essentially, Dell and Amor are both
willing to offer more than the Escom $5 million and can't fathom why their
bids have been rejected or invalidated.  Amor told me he hopes to get the
judge to open the courtroom floor for bidding right there and then.  How
likely this is, I have no idea.  <deep exhalation> That's all I know.

             GERMANS BID, AND LAND A BARGAIN: ARTICLE SUMMARY
==========================================================================

[Dan Stets, the Philadelphia Inquirer journalist on hand for the auction,
put out an article on the outcome this morning.  This is the
point-by-point summary by Bill Zimmer. -Jason]


"Germans bid, and land a bargain"

Escom AG submitted a winning bid of $6.6 million for Commodore's
assets.  A judge, however, still must approve it.

By Dan Stets
Philadelphia Inquirer Staff Writer

a.  Escom purchased Commodore's assets for $6.6 million yesterday
    during the auction.

b.  A half-dozen or so companies were at the auction but only Escom
    and Dell Computer Company submitted bids backed by the required
    $1 million security deposit.

c.  Dell attached some unspecified conditions to there bid and consequently
    it was disqualified.

d.  Escom will resume manufacturing the Amiga and other Commodore
    products and begin to make Apple-compatible and IBM-compatible
    clones with the Commodore name on them.  The manufacturing will
    be in a plant near Beijing, China.

e.  Escom will attempt to produce a Commodore PowerPC.  This will be
    manufactured in Europe.

f.  Escom has no plans to resume any of Commodore's American manufacturing
    operations.

g.  Both the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York City and the Supreme
    Court of the Bahamas must still approve the sale.

h.  Both IBM and the trustee for Commodore's assets in the Netherlands,
    UK, and the Philippines are objecting to the sale.

i.  A hearing will be held today, Friday, April 21, in U.S. Bankruptcy
    Court to consider the proposed sale to Escom and the objections of
    the above (h) creditors.

j.  Since Commodore's creditors are owed more than $100 million and
    previous estimates of Commodore's auction value were put as high
    as $20 million, the creditors may have reservations about the
    low sale price generated by the auction.

k.  A standing-room-only crowd of 65 attended the auction.  Two creditors,
    Prudential Insurance and Microsoft were in attendance.  Representatives
    from two Chinese electronics companies, New Star and Tietsin Trust &
    Investment Company also were in attendance.

l.  Escom plans a joint venture with Tietsin to manufacture Commodore's
    products.

m.  Also at the auction were representatives of Computer Connection of
    Stockton, California.  They submitted a bid but did not include the
    required $1 million deposit.  There bid was, therefore, disqualified.

n.  CEI apparently teamed up with Dell in its unsuccessful bid.

o.  The Commodore UK management buyout team withdrew before the bidding
    began.

p.  Dell's representative at the auction, Mr. Dalton Kaye, stated that
    his company had not yet given up its attempt to purchase Commodore.
    He further stated that he was not aware until two (2) weeks ago
    about the auction and had insufficient time to evaluate either the
    bid documents or Commodore's assets.
    
    In its latest fiscal year (which ended in January), Dell's sales
    rose 21 percent to $3.5 billion and profits rose to $149 million.

q.  The amount of Dell's bid and the amount of the bid made by Computer
    connection were not made public.  The conditions which Dell attached to
    their bid were also not made public.

Title: Press Release
April 21st 1995

PRESS STATEMENT
---------------

Commodore/Amiga UK Management Buyout


During the last few days leading up to the bidding process it
became clear that ESCOM and their associates or DELL COMPUTERS
would have the financial muscle to overbid our independently
financed offer.

In the circumstances the UK Management Team took the decision to
withdraw early and work with the winning bidder.

In this way our ability to achieve our original objective of
re-establishing the Amiga in a prominent position in the marketplace
would be maximised.



ENDS

[I'd just like to take this time to point out...by the corporate structure
of Commodore, Commodore UK will become a WHOLLY OWNED subsidiary of Escom.
Their room to maneuver in that capacity could be rather limited. -Jason]

  jcompton  OK.  Today, the only valid bid presented to the liquidators was
            from Escom.

  jcompton  Two other bids were presented.  One, from Creative Computers
            (NOT CEI, a California-based dealer) was rejected because they
            could not put up the necessary deposit.

[NOTE: I was wrong, it wasn't Creative Computers.]

  jcompton  The second, from Dell (PC-clone manufacturer) was rejected
            because it dictated a 7-day investigation period on patents.

  jcompton  The liquidators ruled that any and all conditions were
            unacceptable, which is why Alex Amor and presumably David
            Pleasance did not bid.

  jcompton  So, Escom's standing bid of $5 million was accepted.

  jcompton  NOW-Tommorow Judge Garrity will be ruling on the objections to
            the sale.

  jcompton  In addition to the objections from the C= US creditors, the
            liquidators of Commodore BV/Philippines/Netherlands/UK, and
            IBM...

  jcompton  He will ALSO have objections from Alex Amor, very probably from
            Dell, and possibly from David Pleasance.

  jcompton  Essentially, Dell and Amor are both willing to offer more than
            the Escom $5 million and can't fathom why their bids have been
            rejected or invalidated.

  jcompton  Amor told me he hopes to get the judge to open the courtroom
            floor for bidding right there and then.  How likely this is, I
            have no idea.

  jcompton  <deep exhalation>  That's all I know.

  jcompton  Sorry I don't have better news.

   HammerD  jcompt: will this be all said and done tomorrow or do you think
            it will take longer?

  jcompton  Well...I mean, Garrity could throw out all of the objections
            and then we're stuck.  Or, he could accept them...

  JosherII  Why is this bad news?

  jcompton  Josher: Because nobody has the first clue what Escom wants.

     Intrd  jcompton but is that you that said that ESCOM is willing to
            give out tehcnology to poeple like CEI?

  jcompton  Intrd: Wasn't me.  CEI and Escom have had talks, but apparently
            Escom was acting very coldly towards Alex today.

      Zool  jcompton: shit...what else would Escom want to do with the
            tech?

  jcompton  Zool: We don't know.

   HammerD  jcompt: was alex pissed?

  jcompton  HD: "Exasperated" would be the word.  At the end of our talk,
            he put me on hold for a few minutes, told me he got some new
            good information and that there was still hope, and left.

  jcompton  HD: I don't know if he's just being dramatic or what.

     Pappy  Escom is incabable of continuing the Amiga(esp. development)

  jcompton  Pappy: They seem to have enough money to do it, but they don't
            seem to have the inclination.

   Menacer  Jcompton: Are Dell just after patents or are they intrested in
            selling Amiga's ?  I live in Austin TX (where dell is based)
            and know quite a lot about the company ....

  jcompton  Menacer: We don't know word #1 about Dell.  This is the first
            I've heard of them interested, even in the wildest fantasy of
            false information.

     Intrd  Jcompton but is it aT DELL or Compaq tjhat some ex-Engineer of
            C= working on the AAA were engaged?

  jcompton  Intrd: That's Tim McDonald at Compaq.

     Pappy  jcompton: Honestly, do you see Escom winning the entire
            auction?

  jcompton  Pappy: As of now, they HAVE.  I'm hoping the good grace of the
            judge overturns it because it's silly.

 NiteFlite  JCompton, so what's on Comp.sys.Amiga.misc is true?

  jcompton  Nite: More or less, yes.

  JosherII  JC: If they aren't planning to do any R&D do you think they
            would be willing to sell the rights to do so?

  jcompton  Josher: I know nothing about them.

  jcompton  Nite: Alex objects and hopes that the judge overturns the Escom
            deal and opens the floor for more bids.

 NiteFlite  JC, so CUK and CEI did not bid because they are banking on the
            objections to be upheld.

  jcompton  Nite: No, Alex did not want to submit a bid without any
            conditions.

   HammerD  did not objections have to be in by last week?

  jcompton  HD: Objections to the sale PROCESS, but if you were a bidder,
            you can object to the bidding process as it happened.

 NiteFlite  Alex, will then just wait to see who wins and negotiate with
            them?

  jcompton  Nite: No, I JUST SAID, Alex will hope that he can put in a bid
            on his own terms tomorrow.

  jcompton  Nite: I don't know what Pleasance is doing.  I'd ask him if I
            knew what hotel he was staying in.  :)

     Intrd  jcompton so you know where is alex?

  jcompton  Intrd: Yes...

   HammerD  jcompt: you going to talk to Amor again tonight?

  jcompton  HD: No, I think he'll be in meetings until he goes to sleep.
            (He had a meeting at 2 am this morning, if that gives you any
            indication...)

  fallous_  The ONLY fucking way that the Amiga production would be slowed
            is if Escom won, and of course they did.  Goddamn, this is
            complete bullshit.

  jcompton  fallous: You could have Dell if you prefer. :)

  fallous_  jcompton: I'm still trying to figure out why Dell wanted it.

  jcompton  fallous: Patents for lawsuits.

  jcompton  fallous: Set-top technology, maybe.

  jcompton  Mitchman: On the contrary, Commodore UK is up for sale, they're
            part of Commodore International.

 NiteFlite  JC, did Alex say how much he was willing to go?

  jcompton  Nite: No.

  toymaker  are all the companies at the auction listed in that news file?

  toymaker  (in other words, is there another outside party besides Dell
            and IBM)

  jcompton  toymaker: Everyone who bid or should have bid, not counting the
            people who showed up to try to bid piecemeal but never really
            did.

    skyman  JCompton: so did anyone not show that was expected to?

  jcompton  skyman: No.

  jcompton  toymaker: IBM's not bidding, they're objecting.

     Gazer  jcompton: Cool, nect think you know we will get the soapie
            "AMIGA: the true story"

  jcompton  Gazer: Well, the prospects for a book keep getting better...

    skyman  JCompton: were you there? how long was the session today?

  jcompton  skyman: I wasn't there.  Once it started, it only took a few
            hours because they just rejected everything but the Escom bid
            and everyone had to go home.

  jcompton  Mitchman: The patent license [IBM's license on Commodore
            patents] is VERY broad.  I tried calling IBM's lawyers to get
            some clarity, but they never returned my calls.

  fallous_  who set the terms on whether a bid is accepted or not?

  jcompton  fallous: The liquidator and his lawyers, subject to the
            approval of US Bankruptcy Court Justice William Garrity, Jr.

      oleg  Amiga might have had a hope if Dell won ;)

  toymaker  oleg:  why is that?

      oleg  toymaker, because Dell is a gigantic, solvent computer maker
            with credibility.

   HammerD  oleg *PC* company.

      oleg  hammerd, what's your point?  they are big, they are solvent,
            and they want Amiga

  jcompton  oleg: They want Commodore's assets...that's not necessarily the
            Amiga, especially at these prices...

      oleg  i don't think CEI has the $$ to compete.  pure and simple.  the
            best they will dois startup 1200/cd32 lines, saturate the
            marketplace, tehn sell off the technology

  jcompton  oleg: You could well be right.  Of course, nobody knows who's
            backing Amor or Pleasance, either.

        AH  jcompton: Again, Thank You!  YOU should get a Medal or
            something.  :) Well, off to spread the news in My Home
            Boards...  :)

  jcompton  AH: I'd prefer a job...

   Number1  oleg: One of the press releases I received from CEI (several
            months ago) said they were prepared to spend $20 Million on
            advertising during the first year if they won.

  jcompton  #1: That's invalid now.  They don't have that sort of money to
            blow.

    Ahzwon  jcompton: So, out of all this, your *personal* opinion of
            tomorrow's outcome?

  jcompton  Ahz: As usual, it's not up to me.  I HOPE the judge does what
            seems to be the right thing, and re-open the bids.

     Intrd  jcompton didtn you said that Alex got support from IBMM
            supposly to get amifa manifacture?

  jcompton  Intrd: They signed on IBM as a contract manufacturer.  But no
            mention of capital investment.

  jcompton  Intrd: Same thing they do for the Atari Jaguar.  They take the
            plans, build the machines, and take their money.

       dib  wots the countdown to the auction, I wouldnt know wot time it
            is in the US ( it midday Friday 21st here :)

  jcompton  dib: The auction is over.  The court hearing commences in 11
            hours, 30 minutes.

    skyman  jcompton: who does have the most money ...or offered to spend
            the most?

  jcompton  skyman: Unknown.  Amor seems to be able to spend at least $7.5
            million, around what he thinks Dell offered.

  toymaker  jcompton: well doesn't that make it sound like the only way it
            could be resolved tomorrow is if Escom wins

  jcompton  toymaker: Not necessarily.  If things go Amor's way, the
            courtroom floor will become the bidding ground.  I presume
            there's some precedent his lawyers have informed him of, I
            doubt he made that up himself.

  jcompton  toymaker: I'll wait another week if it's not Escom.  A company
            as relucant to talk to ANYONE about ANYTHING as they are just
            doesn't make me feel better.

  toymaker  jcompton:  Such a scenario could be set up in a day?

  jcompton  toymaker: <shrug> Again, I'm not a bankruptcy lawyer.  But he
            seemed convinced that it was at least possible.

   NewOrde  who is dell and what are there plans

  toymaker  NewOrde:  Dell is a PC clone manufacturer

  jcompton  New: And nobody knows what they want.

  JosherII  jcompton: What, in your opinion would be the next viable system
            to invest in..  A PMac or a Pent.  on OS/2?

  jcompton  Josher: Whatever makes you feel good.  Seriously.  I haven't
            switched because at the moment I'm having a great time doing
            this on my 3000.  Play with both and see what you like.

   HammerD  jcompt: what time is the hearing tomorrow?

  jcompton  HD: It's supposed to start at 10:00 EDT, so in 11 hours 30
            minutes.

     Intrd  jcompton hey if i come during lunch time do you think i might
            have some scoop?

  jcompton  Intrd: Maybe.  Zool is going to the hearing and hopes to have a
            laptop, but...well, for the authoritative, condensed,
            summarized, AR'ed version, you have to wait.  :)

  toymaker  I wonder if anyone's videotaping the auction.  :)

  toymaker  that would be interesting to watch...

  jcompton  toymaker: No cameras allowed.  No recording equipment of any
            kind allowed.

        JP  jcompton: who exactly made the decision to accept Escoms bid,
            the Judge?

  jcompton  JP: No, the liquidator and his lawyers.

  jcompton  JP: The judge hears everything tomorrow.

       mUb  Ahzwon: Thats what im trying to say to these people, it may not
            be so bad after all.....

  jcompton  Mub: Escom has rejected all contact with Amiga users.

  jcompton  Mub: Does THAT makes you feel good?

   HammerD  jcompt: he may take time to "rule" on these objections.. :(((

  jcompton  HD: He's had a week to read half of them...

       mUb  JC: Indeed no, CBM were just like that....

  jcompton  Mub: I have had AR reps call, other perople have tried...they
            have lied about their interest and now just won't talk about
            it.

   steiner  jcompton: so I was correct? E! won't make/sell Amigas?

  jcompton  steiner: Well, we don't know at all.

  toymaker  Is Gould at the auction?

  jcompton  toy: I don't think so.

  toymaker  jcompton: yah..  his life would probably be at risk or
            something..  :)

   NewOrde  Does anyone know anything about the AOS project that C=Uk have
            had underway for a while know is it gonna be released with the
            A4000 and A1200

  jcompton  NewOrde: Commodore UK's head of developer support forwarded a
            letter from David Pleasance saying "We think what you're doing
            is great, hey, we're going to get the Amiga so we'd like you
            to help develop for us."

(Josh Galun, editor of Amiga Link Online magazine, and Giorgio Gomelsky of
the AMUSE Amiga user group were lucky [or unlucky enough, depends on your
viewpoint] to be at the hearing today...they got two candidates for
interviews, too...-Jason)


Interview with Bernard van Tienen ESCOM.  Friday April 21, 1995
[van Tienen is a former vice-president of Commodore International.]

by Josh Galun (JG) assisted by Giorgio Gomelsky (GG)

JG: How much can you say about your plans for the Amiga?

BvT: We are setting up a group of advisors to advice us which products we
should produce and we are digging into every product solutions not only
Amigas but other products like Commodore products, TV set-top boxes, we
are considering PowerPCs with Amiga, we are considering everything at the
moment.

JG: How soon do you think you'll be able to have Amigas in production?

BvT: We haven't decided yet, but we have all the links with the factories.
Escom is a big European group at the moment, we assemble our own machines,
we have all the contacts with the manufacturers, we spoke already with
them, the only thing is which product should we produce, which quality an
then we get started.  We presume we'll have the first products, the first
Amiga products on the market within 3 months...

JG: As I understand it, ESCOM is one of the biggest computer-sellers in
Europe, I assume AMIGAS will be in all their stores, is that true?

BvT: Not only Amigas but we will also produce Commodore PCs, ja, and of
course we will use our own stores in Europe but besides that we will
distribute products into other countries and also to other dealers in
Europe...

JG: The Amiga has a very vibrant community as well as many public domain
programmers, do you plan to use them in any way or contact them and ask
them what they think...

BvT: Of course, of course, ja...

JG: With the developers as well?

BvT: Ja, ja, everybody will be involved...as many as possible to advice us
on the Commodore and Amiga products...

JG: Do you plan to attempt to hire any of the technicians who used to be
with Commodore?

BvT: Of course, we are already busy with it and already have some
contracts.  But a lot of Commodoore people are already working for ESCOM,
for instance I was vice-president of Commodore International, Peter
Tachenko...  I think there are already roughly 100 ex-Commodore people
working for ESCOM at the moment.

JG: Do you have a position on whether you would license the Amiga
technology and software to clone-makers?

BvT: Not only to clone makers but also to people who want to produce
products and need some of our licences.  We are already busy with that,
we've made some principal contacts, ja, on that.

JG: How long have you been working to try and buy what was left of
Commodore?

BvT: We started with it, let's see, eh, last year in August 1994.

JG: Had ESCOM been interested in the Amiga before the buy-out, in having
Amigas in their stores?

BvT: The point is that ESCOM.  ...must have lasted 3/4 years.  We sold
Amigas in the past in our stores...

JOSH TAKES A BREAK

GG: You are aware that the Amiga has a tremendously loyal following?

BvT: We know Commodore very well because I was vice-president of Commodore
International and I know everybody and everything about C= of course...

GG: Do you intend to use this energy that comes from the passion of the
Amiga users?

BvT: Of course, of course, the biggest asset is not only the name and the
products but also the user-groups.  There are millions of Amiga users and
even more 64 users still, ja.  We are also planning to roll out products
in China and other countries...

GG: How would you achieve this contact with the users?  Would you put up a
site on the Internet?

BvT: We haven't decided yet but everything is possible.  Also we would use
the magazines of course, there are hundreds of magazines, so ok, we
haven't got the deal yet, but as you heard in the court now it looks like
we'll get the deal in a couple of weeks, we have planned a lot but now
we'll be able to roll it out, ja?  So give us some time, ja, we'll
consider everything...

GG: Could the users be in touch with you, say over the next month or so
and communicate their concern?

BvT: Ja, we will install people everywhere, in Europe, in the States. 
Call me and I will tell you who and where they are.  We are aware of the
frustrations users had under the old management...

JOSH GETS BACK

JG: Do you have any plans already in place or being discussed with CEI
about working with them on the Amiga?

BvT:  We can't disclose that at the moment.

JG: Was C= UK part of the buy-out?

BvT (pointing at Colin Proudfoot passing by): That's C= UK...  "Ok, Colin,
see you next week, ok?" It's not part of the deal at the moment, but next
week we have an apoointment with C= to see what we can do with them.  We
are talking with them...

JG: Do you have plans to work with them or to possibly buy them out?

BvT: Both are possible...

GG: My main concern is for the users, this has been a long slog...

BvT: Yes, I think it is a good thing that finally there is this sale.  We
already wanted to buy last year, but we couldn't proceed, we couldn't
hurry it up, ja, it took so long...

JG: Can I ask you a bit of a personal question?  Do you own an Amiga
yourself?  Which one"

BvT: I don't own an Amiga at the moment...

JG (smiling): But you're planning on getting one, yeah?

BvT: I,I,I..I've used Amiga in the past, ja, in my office.  I'll get a new
one that's coming out, we don't know what spec it will be, we are working
on it hard at the moment...

JG: Do you have any plans to have some online chats on the Internet?  Do
make more use of the Internet?

BvT: Of course the Internet is going around right now, it's very popular
in the States, also booming right now in Europe, so ja, something will
happen...  We will set up support groups to get to know what is going on
all over the place...

JG: Do you plan to make separate Amiga packages with software bundles,
let's say a Modem Package, a Game Package, as C= UK has done in the past?

BvT: It worked very well out in the UK, I know the figures because I was
involved and everything is possible...but we can also bring out other
products under the Amiga name, ja, we can also bring other technology into
the Amiga, if you want, ja, we haven't defined it yet but we are
considering everything and we expect a lot from Commodore and Amiga,
otherwise we wouldn't have bought it, ja?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friday April 21, 1995, outside US Bankruptcy Court building 4:15pm

Interview with Colin Proudfoot of C= UK

by Josh Galun

Missed first question

CP: C= UK is waiting for this thing to be over.  We then look forward to
working with ESCOM and reviewing their plans for the future of Commodore
cause they're gonna drive the technology and in effect they are quit
likely to end up the owners of the C= UK business.

JG: Do you believe ESCOM will buy C=UK as they exist right now or do you
believe they will license you as clone-makers?

CP: I don't think ESCOM will leave C=UK outside its organization, so it's
a technical question in acoounting terms whether it's expedient for them
to keep the corporate identity as it is today or create a new corporate
identity or use their existing structure and merge the C=UK within that. 
I think that was is key is that they will retain a lot of the staff from
the UK organization because we have the expertise on the market place.

JG: If you were allowed to make your own plans for the UK market of the
Amiga, what would they be?  If ESCOM gave you that, how would market the
Amiga and make it viable again?

CP: I don't think that is a realistic question because if you look at the
market place as a whole you can't exclude the UK from the rest of Europe
or the rest of the world.  Computing nowadays is very much a global market
and we would have to fall in line with ESCOM.  A regards to what marketing
plans we would see, David Pleasance has outlined the plans he would have
for the market place and the products and how it would develop.  In fact
he will be talking to ESCOM about these things next week and we will see
how many of those ideas they will wish to adopt.

JG: So you're saying that there is nothing that separates the UK market
from the rest of the European market or the global market?

CP: Europe is now a common market and there are no technical bounderies
for free movement of goods and services so a product that's launched in
the UK one day we'll find in Germany the next day, or in Holland or in
Danmark.

JG: I heard that C=UK has good developers' relationships.  Have you been
talking to them about the buyout and what information have you gotten from
them that might be helpful to ESCOM?

CP: Well the UK has a very strong software community and a lot of
developers are based in there and we've been talking to them throughout
the buyout, we've been discussing ideas for eventual new products and I
think ESCOM will be very interested in the discussion that we had and the
results of those discussions.

JG: Is there any technology that C=UK has that has not been released or
that it still owns the rights to?

CP: C=UK has never owned any of the rights to the technology, it's merely
been a licensee.  All rights have always been held by CEL in the Bahamas
or Commodore-Amiga in California.  To come back to the developers, we
recognise and I think the ESCOM people recognise how important the
relationships with the development community are and on behalf of David
and myself I wish to thank the development community for their support
over the last 12 months.  It' been absolutely tremendous, we couldn't have
asked for any more support or any better encouragement from the guys all
around the world.  Hopefully we're looking forward to working with ESCOM
working with the developers' community and putting the Amiga back on top
of the market place, which is what we wanted all along.

JG: The US is a very competitive, intense and big market.  Do you think
ESCOM will want tto and are able to attack it properly?

CP: You should ask them.  I can only speculate and have a personal opinion
and I would say the following: ESCOM have been phenomenally successful as
a PC vendor in Europe and they have grown the business tremendously.
Where do they go from there?  They look to North America.  How they
penetrate the American market?  Can they do it with a "me-too" computer? 
No they can't!  So therefore they need a product to differentiate
themselves from the rest of the competition and just maybe, just maybe,
the Amiga is that product.

JG: What are your personal feelings about the end of the buyout?

CP: I'm very glad it's over!

JG: Are you an Amiga user yourself?

CP: I have a CD32 at home and in the office a Commodore 486 PC.

JG: Do you have any plans of switching to the Amiga?

CP: I am not a technologist I am a businessman.  What I do is I talk to
David Pleasance and the rest of the guys in the UK to get an understanding
from them about the technology and its applications.  My job is business.

This is the end of an era, certainly.  But it's not the end of the
Amiga-not yet.

We'll still be here for quite some time...after all, the overhead on Amiga
Report is pretty low. :)

For those of you lucky enough to get this in time, everyone is welcome to
come to the IRC conference on channel #auction being held at 11:00 PM EDT
(Eastern US time), where we will present the information as we know it,
and members of the New York Amiga user group AMUSE and Amiga Link editor
Josh Galun (who were all present at the hearing) will give their
interpretation of the day's events.)

Amiga Report 3.09 will be out in about a week...working up to this auction
has distracted us from normal operations.  Sorry.

===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

AR can also be read with Mosaic (in either AmigaGuide or html form). 
Reading AmigaReport with Mosaic removes the necessity to download it.  It
can also be read using programs found in UNIX sites such as LYNX.

Simply tell Mosaic to open the following URL:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/News/AR/index.html

Or, for those in Europe, the Polish site is:
http://sun1000.ci.pwr.wroc.pl/AMIGA/AR/

Amiga information can also be accessed at this URL:
http://www.prairienet.org/community/clubs/cucug/amiga.html

Mosaic for the Amiga can be found on Aminet in directory comm/net, or
(using anonymous ftp) on max.physics.sunysb.edu

Mosaic for X, Macintosh(tm) and Microsoft Windows(tm) can be found on
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu

==                    Amiga Report Writing Guidelines                    ==
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.
