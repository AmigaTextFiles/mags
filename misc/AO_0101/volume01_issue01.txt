Amiga.org update newsletter - volume 1, issue 1 - 3 September, 1999
-----

Welcome to the first edition of the Amiga.org weekly update newsletter.  We've waited a couple of weeks to let things stabilize with the site, but it's been a really interesting week.  

Collas is out, McEwen is gone, news flow to the world has been severed temporarily severed.  What does all this mean?  No one knows yet, though the Internet is simply rabid with speculation and rumors.  

Over the next few weeks, our newsletter will change, will evolve, so if there are errors here, please forgive us.  Otherwise, please feel free to drop us tips and pointers to webmaster@amiga.org and we'll look at fixing or incorporating them.

On the subject of resources, we're currently in the process of verifying and validating some three thousand (3000+) links that have been submitted to the site in the last ten days.  We get about 100 done on a good day, so please understand if adding your link takes a few more days than expected..
