    I am very pleased at the response I have been receiving about the
ESCOM/U.S. Distributor text that I generated based on the meeting I attended
with them in Philidelphia, PA USA on July 14th.  (See enclosed text file
LATEST_ESCOM.TXT or if the file is missing from the archive, check AMINET; the
next Amiga Report will ALSO have a reprinting of it).  The Amiga community
still cares.  Sigh.  I am very happy about that.  I get almost 30 messages a
day at present regarding the text file.  All are happy that I provided and
incredibly displeased with the handling of the Amiga in the U.S.

   I can't blame them.  I forward the best of the messages I get to Ed Goff's
EMail box (which I bet is brimming full since someone released the EMail
address).  Suffice to say (read the text file and you will understand) that
the American market is going to remain a quiet niche market while the European
market will boom like crazy.  At least that will keep the U.K. developers
going and therefore we will always have some software to play with.  But
enough of all this.  It is time for the REAL entertorial commentary.

        The Eighties are over, folks.  Dark Unicorn Productions(tm) games are
starting to require something greater than a vanilla A500;  and we are not the
only ones.  It is time to ask yourself how much you love your Amiga. I know a
lot of you are afraid to upgrade in these weird uncertain days, but please
stop and take a look at a few things.

        First, the vanilla A500 (512K RAM, no hard drive, AmigaDOS 1.3, Old
Chip Set) is over a decade old.  That is 8088 technology for those loser PC
owners. How many of today's PC games will run on a 640K 4Mhz 8088 computer? If
you get over one hand counting them I will be surprised.  Yet some Amiga
companies are STILL making games for these ten year old machines.  Who pays
the price for the general population's failure to upgrade?  The people who are
keeping the Amiga alive BY upgrading.  Is it fair that the Amiga version of
DUNE II had to be trimmed down to fit in an A500 with one meg of RAM when I
spent hundreds of dollars improving my A500 and A2000 with hard drives and
memory?  Of course not.  But WESTWOOD had no choice but to release a crippled
scaled down version because my A500/14mhz/40MBHD/2MB RAM was in the minority.
The Amiga market isn't cut throat and heavy handed by forcing people to
upgrade to play the latest games like their PC counterparts. Maybe they need
to be.  It is only recently that Maxis and Ocean are taking steps to get the
Amiga market going.  SIM CITY 2000 (alright, this one was even a bit slow on
my A4000/040 but at least it got ported - it wouldn't have if there was no AGA
040 based machines out there) and the forthcoming TFX flight sim (oh boy I
can't wait) are prime examples of what happens when the companies ignore the
cries of A500 owners who spent $200 on a computer and haven't lifted a finger
or a dollar to expand it in a decade.  TEAM 17 is joining into the foray with
their newest games like ALIEN BREED 3D and SPERIS LEGACY requiring AGA or a 1
Megabyte Chip RAM equipped Amiga.  What do you expect, people?  If you are so
unhappy with your unexpanded A500 why don't you go and buy a PC and see what
pain and suffering REALLY is when you have to upgrade BI-MONTHLY to play the
latest games.  Going through the computer magazines, I noted that it would
cost you about $250 to add a small hard drive and some RAM to your A500.  That
is the cost of a good sound board for a PC.  Think about it. Second, take a
moment and think about the big developers.  Think about the programmers and
programming houses that make PC, 3D0, and Jaguar games (you mean there are
actually houses MAKING Jag games?  No way!).  Put yourself in THEIR shoes.
TIME WARNER takes a game like PRIMAL RAGE with all the cool graphics, speed,
options, etc. and considers porting it over to the Amiga.  Well, if they want
to hit the broadest (non-upgrading) audience, it has to be vanilla A500
compatible. This means 32 colors at 7mhz with 1 meg of memory running off of
floppy. Those of you who have seen PRIMAL RAGE at the arcade should know that
this would totally suck.  So, there goes about 4 million potential sales. Now,
they decide to go with the vanilla A1200 platform.  This is a little better:
256 colors, 14mhz running off of floppy.  With some pain and suffering, A1200
owners could live with this so they release it with hard drive install
capabilities but geared to be run at 14mhz with 2 MB of RAM. In order to do
this, they cut out a bunch of stuff that the Sega GENESIS 4 megabyte cartridge
might have as well as the goodies that the 8 meg of RAM, half gigabyte hard
drive that the average PC user has.  Who gets the raw end of the deal?  Amiga
users.  Sure, the CD32 version will have most of the cool intro/outro/cutro
scenes, but that is only a 5 digit market there so far. You want to know who
will be whining first about this game?  Not the A1200 owner you just got
robbed out of all those goodies.  Not the CD32 owner who has to listen to his
PC CD-ROM buddy tell him how cool HIS version of PRIMAL RAGE is. Nope, the
vanilla A500 user will be the first one to bitch about not being able to play
PRIMAL RAGE off an 836K floppy-based ten year old system.

        Finally, consider the company that DOES cater to the vanilla A500 user
and ports their games over from other platforms.  It takes them so much longer
to convert the 256 color graphics to 64 or 32 colors.  They have to decide
what to remove first to make it fit in RAM.  They have to arrange the data so
that it loads off of a SINGLE floppy disk (think about this when you get
pissed off that a game only utilizes DF0:) cleanly.  So a great game like UFO:
ENEMY UNKNOWN which is a cool game (even for a PC) on every other platform
turns into crap when it is ported to a vanilla A500.  Who is the first person
to complain that the game sucks?  That the game is a let down compared to
other platforms?  The non-upgrading vanilla A500 owner.

        People are maturing, though, as well as the Amiga systems.  Now
vanilla A1200's are becoming standard and we just can't fight the AGA machine
takeover any more.  I loved my A2000 and as expanded as it was, I still hadn't
upgraded to AGA.  I fought AGA tooth and nail and finally broke down and got a
CD32 (coolest console ever) and expanded it to that vanilla A1200 standard.  I
am not at ALL unhappy that I did.  Now I can look forward to the cool new
titles and hardware that is yet to come.  So far, Dark Unicorn Productions(tm)
games do not require AGA, just a decent ECS machine. In the future, this is
VERY likely to change.  Remember, if we were like the PC realm, every game
that came out would require an AGA machine running at 40mhz+.  Thank your
lucky stars that we aren't.  Consider showing your Amiga how much you love her
and put that hard drive and memory expander on her. Better yet, put an AGA
Amiga next to her and give her some company.  Then you, too, can help fasion
the future of Amiga entertainment.

                           @{i} By Shane R. Monroe@{ui} 

        As usual I have been BROWSING through the latest magazines, listening
to the latest chatter amongst developers, and keeping my ear to the door to
get the latest bit of FUTURE ENTERTAINMENT news.  I think you will love some
of this stuff.

... All this talk about PRIMAL RAGE (Time Warner Interactive) keeps getting me
more excited with anticipation of the August/September release date. This
issue, I finally got a chance to get some MORE information about the game.
First, ECS owners rejoice since it seems PR for the Amiga will be playable on
your machines.  AGA people might be groaning, but wait!  I saw the screen
snapshots guys.  RELAX!  It looks GREAT!  250 frames of animation per
character, awesome backrounds, and they left the humans in the game! Now you
can eat, stomp, and throw your way to a more shapely figure.  Heh heh heh. A
playable demo is due out next month.  WHEE!

... Remember POLE POSITION?  The old crappy graphics Atari driving game with
that hot sounding girl's voice saying 'Prepare to Qualify'?  Well, the name is
back, but the game is a WHOLE lot different.  This game takes on the
managarial system similar to ON THE BALL (made by the same people) and lets
you watch the outcome.  The graphics in the snapshot are looking unbelievable;
I only hope the game is a bit more interesting that ON THE BALL though.
TOURING CAR CHALLENGE is another managersim racing game announced.  Sheeze,
doesn't anyone want to actually DRIVE anymore?

... The first ads for ALIEN BREED 3D are in the mags.  They look great. Sigh.
I can't wait.  Fortunately, I have GLOOM to tide me over.

... Millennium seems to be ramping down Amiga development these days. Only a
couple of weak titles as of late, although they do have a new game to be
bundled with a game pad.  Name?  MASTER AXE.  Like the name.

... Grandslam's BASE JUMPERS will be released for the CD32 this month. Er, uh,
why?

... THE ONE magazine in the U.K. is now dead.  This is due to the current
'failing' games market.  Many of its writers will be putting their pages into
CU AMIGA magazine.  This is the sign of VERy bad times.

... Good news to gamers.  Datel's famous ACTION REPLAY cartridge is now
available for PCMCIA slot Amiga owners.  KUDOS!  Now the new A1200's will have
all that cheating, ripping ability too!

... Rumor mill says that PIZZA TYCOON will not be available after all. More
news when I get it from MicroProse.  (If you want it reviewed for the media,
you know where to send it ;)

... Dark Unicorn Production's(tm) new games DESERT APACHE and OCEAN WARRIORS
should be out this month.  DESERT APACHE is the latest from TOMCAT's author
John Graham, Jr. and believe me when I tell you that the beta version is
incredibly playable.  MUCH better than TOMCAT - and it is in COLOR (Well, more
or less.  You be the judge).  Considerably smaller than Tomcat, DESERT APACHE
will come on four floppies vice Tomcat's whopping seven.  OCEAN WARRIORS takes
classic BATTLESHIP and SCORCHED TANKS and melds them together with full motion
video clips showing you the action.  Several types of weapons to choose from
including cloaking devices, spy planes, and more. Look for a playable soon.

        For those of you who are forced into a dual life of Amiga and PC, and
are trapped into running that LESSER OS on your PC, you are very familiar with
the included Windoze game called MINESWEEPER.  If so, you can skip the next
part to the next paragraph.

        This is a very simple, yet maddeningly addictive concepts.  You start
off with a huge uncovered grid.  You can either select to  uncover the box, or
LOCK it.  If you lock it and there is a mine hidden, it is removed from the
'left to find' total.  When you do uncover a box, you will be rewarded with a
mine (boom, game over), or a number that tells you how many boxes adjacent to
that box have mines in them.  Odd sounding, I know.  It gets to be a great
challenge and  downright frustrating after awhile.  The process of elimination
comes in handy ALOT!

        Now, what is the deal with THIS version of 'minesweeper'?  Well, heh
heh, it is minesweeper to be sure.  How much different can one version be from
one to the other, right?

        Well, this version is very clean.  The best one to date.  If you want
a game of minesweeper, this is the ONLY one you should get.  As for the
details, they follow below.

        First, clean smooth HD installer via the AmigaDOS INSTALLER util. No
problems at all.  You can select various languages for the documentation and
game language.  Very nice. It opens on a public screen if desired and just
sits there and multitasks like a dream.

            Like I said, it is hard to talk much more about a minesweeper
game, but this is the best I've seen.  Pick it up and give it a try.

     At the last minute, the beta release of this game dropped on  my head,
delaying the issue another day! ;)  But, I felt it was  worth it 100%. 
 
     Welcome to the introduction of a new era.  Earlier this year,  Dark
Unicorn Productions(tm) startled the gaming world with the  first live action
full motion video game that didn't require  hardware.  TOMCAT - THE HUNT
BEGINS broke a couple of other  undocumented records as well.  The shareware
freely distributable  version clocked in at almost three megs compressed and
the  registered version ate up almost twelve megs of hard drive space  after
installation.  I am pretty sure that holds the largest  Shareware game in
Amiga history record.  If I am wrong, someone  please let me know via EMail. 
 
     Although it was impressive as a first release, TOMCAT did have  a couple
of flaws that the gaming community were quick to point  out.  Author John
Graham took these to heart in bringing you the  latest in FMV action games:
DESERT APACHE.  Through the magical  programming of DUP(tm) member Seumas
McNally, Desert Apache now  offers a FULL SCREEN MODE so you can enjoy this
exciting action  game even more. 
 
     For those of you who missed TOMCAT (shame on you - it was a breakthrough,
even if it does have a few flaws) it was a game where  you took control over
an F14 Tomcat, shooting down bogies while  flying through real digitized
landscapes.  Granted, it was 1/4  screen and in black and white, but never
before had a company  attempted something so large AND in a shareware game. It
did lack  a little in gameplay;  it was a bit repetetive in the enemy
shootdown sequence (which was the real meat of the gameplay).  Most people
liked the concept, but didn't care for the limited gameplay,  b&w graphics,
and the 1/4 screen viewport. 
 
     DESERT APACHE (DA) is the next generation of full motion video  software
video games for the Amiga.  Using DUP's new D)igital  V)ideo E)ngine (DVE),
you now have the option to play the game in  a 'chunky pixel' mode which gives
you full screen action.  This is  quite cool if you stand the proverbial 3-5
feet away from the  monitor while you play, or play it on a standard big
picture TV.   Of course, this requires a decent speed Amiga to get the good
frame  rate of the 1/4 screen mode, but even a modest AGA machine will  find
it perfectly acceptable.  It is quite exciting to play it in  full screen
mode, and on my A4000/040 it is just as fast as the 1/4  screen mode.  The
best part is that the full screen mode takes up  no more hard drive space than
the other mode.   Clever. 
 
     The other major complaint was the blatant black and white  mode.  This is
simply a limitation of the hardware and is used to  insure that ALL Amiga's
can use the game.  In DA, John Graham  utilizes a very nice sepia tone on the
video clips, giving them a  much more colorful look to them.  While it is not
TRUE color, it is  a huge step above TOMCAT. 
 
     Now for the game play.  On TOMCAT, you simply picked similar  missions,
shot down all the bogies in each area, and then landed on  your carrier while
meeting some specific time constraints.  The  bogie targeting system was a bit
sluggish and slow and pissed a lot  of people off.  You will all be happy to
know that DA is  considerably different, although at first look you may think
that  it is just TOMCAT all over again. 
 
     The game is a 'Choplifter meets TOMCAT' scenario.  You must  rescue the
POWs behind enemy lines with your weapon equipped  chopper.  The layout is
initially like TOMCAT.  There are zones to  enter, then specific areas to hit.
Each area can have a variety of  different action sequences.  If you encounter
a helicopter on the  way in, you will fight the helocopter.  If not, you may
have to  destroy an enemy ground installation before landing to get your men.

 
     The ground attack is much akin to TOMCAT, although the  controls for the
targeting system are MUCH faster and smoother for  DA.  You simply move the
crosshair to the target and hit the button  before you get too close.  If you
fire and MISS the target, you are  greeted with seeing your own men blown
away.  I did find myself  killing my own men one or two games, just to, you
know, see if the  game would, uh, crash or something.  Should you be
succesful, you  will land and get your men.  Cool video sequences, although
not as  many as TOMCAT to save some space. 
 
     The helicopter action sequences are SERIOUSLY cool.  You go  through a
series of 'dragon's lair' style moves to shake the  chopper.  Although this
sounds lame, the sequences are put together  fast and stylish, making this the
best part of the game for me.   Your blood will churn at least a LITTLE bit.
If you shake the  chopper, you will fly in behind and get YOUR chance to do
the  killing.  Similar to TOMCAT's shoot down sequence, this again is  much
smoother and realistic as the helicopter goes darting around  the heads up
display.  Shooting him down will take you to the  ground attack sequence.
Missing him will put you back on the  offensive and if you move in the same
pattern too often, he will  clip your ass no matter HOW fast you are.  A nice
touch. 
 
     Being the leader of Dark Unicorn Productions(tm) I get a lot  of the mail
intended for John and the other programmers.  From a  lot of the response I
get from TOMCAT, it seems that it was a  love/hate game;  you either loved it,
or hated it (or didn't want  to even try it with how big it was).  DA will
appeal to a broader  range of audiences.  There is enough action to keep
arcade players  entertained for a bit, and the TOMCAT disciples who have been
begging for an expansion disk will go ballistics over this game.   Those of
you who have been tempted to get TOMCAT in the past but  were unsure should
give this game a try. 
 
     The gendre is DEFINATELY progressing.  DA is a huge  improvement over
TOMCAT, and the new DVE will open some serious  doors for the company who is
dying to make a '7th Guest' or  'Mansion of Lost Souls' clone.  We are going
to await response from  the public on this new DVE full screen chunky mode and
see what  people think.  If people like it, the DVE may go into other games
including a TOMCAT ENHANCED patch and/or inclusion of the engine  into future
games. 
 
     DA will likely be available in playable demo format on the  AMINET by the
time you read this review.

What in the hell are you doing wasting your time reading this article? Get
your ass down to your local Amiga store (or call your favorite mail order
house if you are in the States) and get this program right now.  Don't worry,
I will wait.  Go ahead.....

Back?  Good!  Alright now.  I shouldn't need to review this, since you already
have a copy in your hand (right?), but I better do it anyway since I already
said that I would.  I just want you to know that this article is cutting into
my GLOOM time.  (Pack your bags, time to go on a guilt trip.)

Seriously, this game couldn't have come at a better time for either Black

Note:  A special word for our 'good buddies' at ID and APOGEE software "EAT
OUR AMIGA USER SHORTS!  IT *CAN* BE DONE ON THE AMIGA!"

Now that THAT is out of the way, I can get down to business.  In a word, this
is the Amiga's version of DOOM.

First, most of you know how much I hate texture mapped games;  namely the DOOM
series.  Then again, I tend to hate anything that gets rampant publicity and
hype and isn't worth a crap (take the Pentium and WINDOZE for example).  DOOM
was really nothing to get all that excited about and took a well priced
machine to play properly.  Something about it just left me kinda cold.

GLOOM is different.

Before you start calling me a hypocrite, allow me to explain the differences
between DOOM and GLOOM.  Here is the Unicorn's Top Ten Reasons Gloom Is Better
Than Doom:
    10. Gloom runs on an Amiga.
     9. Gloom can run full screen on a 14mhz 68020 processor.
     8. Gloom is less than two megs in size.
     7. Gloom allows two players to play on the same machine.
     8. Gloom features full sized split screen mode for two players
        and is just as fast as one player mode.
     7. Gloom lets you hear BOTH players sound effects on BOTH
        remote and local machines.
     6. Gloom has cool powerups like invisibilty, thermogoggles,
        bouncing bullets, mega weapon charges, and more.
     5. The wall graphics in two player combat mode are intense!
     4. Extra support for the CD32 controller (side stepping, etc).
     3. Gloom only costs $32 ($35 for CD version)
     2. The enemies in Gloom not only scream when you shoot them, but
        their bodies explode in torrid rainfall of body parts.
     1. It has a cool game of Defender you can play on an animated
        wall that the other player can watch over your shoulder.

The satisfaction of Gloom can only be truly experienced when you are sitting
in a dark quiet room, headphones on, the sound jacked up, the game on a 27" TV
modem connected to someone across town running through the HELL SERIES two
player combat arena while you are invisible creeping up behind your opponent
with a seriously charged weapon in hand.  A ghost floats in front of you and
scares the hell out of you.  You open fire in panic and reveal your location
as you pump plasma shells into his back.  He tries to run around the corner
but you simply turn and fire into the wall, your bouncing shots peppering him
in the legs as he flees.  He falls and you are proclaimed the winner.

Sound good?  That is what it is, folks;  "you are in the game" experience. I
approve of the fact that Black Magic Software decided to show they were
intelligent and not follow the DOOM crap about 'virtual reality' game play.
Oh, it is GREAT, to be sure, but it is NOT VR.  For now, though, it is the
next best thing!

The game itself is a mission type deal.  You know, traverse the levels looking
for this and that.  Pretty single minded in goal, but there are a LOT of
surprises on the way.  Although the game initially appears to be the same
vicious bloodbath level after level, each level offers up something different
and new;  from robots that pop and and kick your ass, to spinning rooms, to
video games you can play on the wall.  Transporters pop up after awhile, and
it seems to get more and more complicated to get the doors open you need to.
The level of intensity is perfect and it starts you off slow and brings you
around at a nice pace.  The challenge level is enough to keep you coming back
but not enough to infuriate you into not playing any more. PERFECTLY DONE.

Modem play is a little bit of a bitch.  You have to make your modem ready
before you load GLOOM (i.e. load Terminus, NComm, or something to get the
modem 'terminal ready') and then set the baud rate in GLOOM to match your
modem.  If you only have two megs of RAM or a CD32, you may not get the modem
play to work.  You may also hook up a null modem cable between two machine
sand select null modem and the link will be complete. Once linked, one player
controls all the functions of the game such as mission or combat, quitting the
game, etc.  Both players may still individualy select screen resolution, size,
floors, ceiling, etc. for their machine.  You can plainly see your
partner/opponent and in cooperative mode, you can't hurt each other.  During
the link, you may both type on the chat line at the top of the screen.  This
is limited to alpha/numeric characters, but it is adequete to get the 'you go
left and I go right' message type thing.  Chat is something you will take for
granted.

In combat, you try to drill the hell out of your opponent.  There are all
sorts of powerups, weapon powerups, etc. to be found and you can set how many
lives the players start with.

Two players can play locally on one machine with the cool horizontal split
screen mode that allows both players MASSIVE play field to kill in.  It is
fine for playing a two player mission, but really not much fun for Combat
Mode, although you can play like that.  Two player modem play is definately
the highlight to this title.

The game really runs in three modes.  Lores quarter screen, hires quarter
screen, and lores full screen.  There are a couple of intermediate modes, but
you will be playing in one of the above.  Hires quarter in you have a less
than a good 030, lores full screen otherwise.  You can select the violence
model too, either 'messy' or 'meaty'.  Although the manual doesn't tell you
the difference, it seems that messy leaves the body parts on the ground after
death (trudging through carcasses is cool), while meaty looks like it produces
a bit more parts during the kill, but they don't stay. Probably for those with
020's and no fast ram.

In all honesty, with a CD32 and no fast ram, I found no mode that was too slow
to bear including the decked out full screen, floors and ceiling in messy
mode.  It is truly a masterpiece.

Well, I will get this over with now.  Suffice to say that if you didn't stop
reading this article yet to get your copy of GLOOM, go now and do it. If you
are in the States, Better Concepts, Inc. carries it for $32 floppy version or
$35 CD32 version.  Call 800 25 AMIGA to get the goods.  Overseas, you should
be able to get it from a local distributor.

Finally a personal plea.  Please don't pirate this game.  Buy it; just this
ONCE!  I want these guys to stick around for a bit.  I bought it as soon as it
hit the shelves here, you guys should too.  It is worth every penny. There is
no copy protection so the two pirate groups to release it already should feel
pretty stupid putting a 'cracktro' on it.

  ---------------------------------------------- ---------------------  

Once again Digial Illusions thrills us with the latest installment in the
pinball series.  This time they have really outdone themselves.

Those of you familiar with the other pinball games of their design PINBALL
FANTASIES and PINBALL DREAMS will understand the basic concept.  Its pinball,
folks.  The PINBALL series had one major difference from regular pinball the
table was always displayed about 1/3 at a time or so, constantly scrolling the
screen to follow the ball.  Naturally this is an aquired taste and a lot of
people didn't like it very much.  (Gives my wife a headache.) The certain lack
of features, namely multiball play was also a hang up of most die hard game
players.

You will all be tickled to know that PINBALL ILLUSIONS fixes almost every
conceivable complaint users had about the prior two games.  Not only is there
multiball play, but now you get a near full screen hires display to play on
(if you want it) or you can opt for the other scrolling mode if you are used
to it.  The screen always scrolls with the ball nearest to your flippers (good
deal, eh?).

First things first.  This game is AGA.  It is not a crappy conversion from an
ECS floppy version (in fact, I don't believe that an ECS version is even
planned.  Good.  Get AGA people.)

The music is identical (as is everything) to the floppy version but that
doesn't mean that it is a bad thing!  In fact the music is absolutely
fantastic on every single table (uh, make that ALL THREE tables).  It changes
to match the mood of the game.  Absolutely stunning.  You can even manually
change the music on the BABE WATCH table by entering the jukebox on the
screen.  NEAT!

Compliments of AGA, we now get a hot high resolution mode to play in. This
will allow you to see 95% or so of the screen while you are playing. The
display is crisp and clean and smoothly scrolls the 5% that you don't see when
the ball rolls by.  This mode was developed for use in the multiball mode, but
frankly I like to play the game in the mode all the time.  You can manually
change it during the game and it automatically goes to hires when you hit the
multiball play.  You can go back to lowres anytime you want to, even during
multiball play.Every little detail is paid to mind.  The in game games are
well thoughtout and entertaining (almost as good as the Terminator 2 pinball
game at the arcade).  The ball looks more real.  Just a first class job all
around.  This is worth the hard earned cash, folks.  If you ain't got it, go
get it.

  If you get no other game for your CD32 this decade, get this game.

Okay, so it is a sports game.  Most of you who have followed my mags know that
I don't like sports and that blood and guts rule.  This sporting event just
happens to have enough violence to keep me interested, and better yet, plays
like a DREAM!

Picture this:  an arena about four screens high that smoothly scrolls to
follow the ball in play.  Players running EVERYWHERE.  'Power up' items
appearing at random on the field.  A realistic crowd that actually responds
cleanly to the game play.  Multiple ways to score or even multiply your score.
Men getting knocked next to death on the fields and carried away. Easy passing
interface.  Frantic game play.  Perfect sound and smooth AGA graphics.  Sound
like fun?

This is a futuristic football meets hockey type of game.  The goal is to score
more points that your opponent in a selected amount of time.  There are very
few rules.  If the opponent has the ball, you kick his ass and take it if you
can.  You have a goal to protect but there are other ways of scoring in the
game.  You can light up stars along the arena's walls by throwing the ball at
them, multiply your score by throwing the ball into a contraption on the side
of the arena, even teleport the ball by tossing it into a teleporter hole.
There are instant replays of particularly clever goals.  Passing the ball is
as easy as pushing the button and holding it down for greater distance.  There
are no plays, just anarchy.  It totally rules.

Knock the other guy down enough and he is out of there.  Likewise, you can buy
your men equipment to help give them an edge in both offense and defense.  You
can even trade men.  The game interface was very well thought out on this one,
allowing you to outfit your men individually or as a group. Well done. Minimal
down time between games like this is a must.  You always wanna get back in the
action. This game HAS the action.  Buy a couple of replacement controllers in
advance (since this game doesn't utilize the extra buttons, you can use a
regular Amiga stick for this one many prefer it for this game) as you will use
them hard and long in this fast paced game. Buy a wrap for your thumb too.  It
will be SORE the next day.

For those of you who bought the original floppy version for your Amiga and are
a bit afraid that it would be a waste of cash to buy a CD32 version DON'T BE!
This is better in many ways.  There are more, better colors and the men are a
bit bigger.  The backround crowd is AMAZING.  You can hear individuals in the
crowd shouting at you while you play.  The atmosphere is great.  We killed
MANY afternoons playing it here.

There isn't much else to say about this great game.  If you are looking for a
good sports or violence game, this should suit you fine.  If you liked the
original, you will LOVE this!  An essential CD32 title.

  Forget any demo version of this game you might have seen.  They can't begin
to hold a candle to the sales version of this kick ass bowling game.

Strikes and Spares was the only real bowling game on the Amiga until just
recently, and in all honesty, SnS reminded me of a crappy old Speccy game.
KINGPIN is the best bowling on the Amiga.  (I still like the best bowling game
ever-  TENTH FRAME BOWLING on the C64).

So where does Kinpin succeed where the others failed?  Aesthetics.  Pure and
simple.  Just like baseball, or football, there is very little to improve on
in the basic arena of gameplay if you follow the rules.  Kingpin follows the
rules also, but the little things that it offers really give it the edge.

First thing is TONS of options.  Everything you could want to set up in the
game is here.  Sound, computer aptitude, etc.  Anything you want.

Next, the interface.  Cheers, Team 17!  Finally, an interface that never
pisses you off while you use it.  In fact, I only had one minor gripe about it
and it is minimal.  You select your player's position on the lane pressing
right and left and the ball throw strength up and down.  Moving allthe way to
the bottom of the 'swing bar' causes your ball's weight to change (in case you
decided that 16 pound ball isn't what you wanted).  It toggles through all the
selected weights each time you tap down at the bottom.  I liked it, but maybe
having you do down for lower weights and UP for higher weights would've been
better.  I dunno.  Finally you press the button and an arrow bounces back and
forth on the lane about a third the way down.  This is where you are
attempting to throw it.  This is the skill part.  Now what *I* liked about it,
was that the harder you throw the ball, the faster (and harder to stop at the
right spot) the arrow bounces.  The hook and lane surfaces also come into
play.  Granted it isn't TENTH FRAME, but it is damn good.

The pin action is very good better than Strikes and Spares.  Very realistic. I
would have hated to write the algorithm for that one.  (Physics was never my
strong suit.)  Everything is in place there.

The part that really made this game stand out was the cool soundtrack (so to
speak  huh huh no pun intended dude huh huh).  It is VERY atmospheric.  The
backround sounds of other people playing and the occasional cool announcment
over the loudspeaker letting people know they left their car lights on or to
come to the service desk, or even that a lane is down. Fantasic touch. Again,
kudos to Team 17.

Team 17 rarely puts out trash and this game is just one more example of that
dedication and commitment to quality Amiga entertainment.  Be sure to call
Team 17 and tell them that you want them to do TEAM 17 PINBALL for the Amiga
(right now it is a no go deal) and help support the Amiga side of development.
This is a fine game and certainly belongs in any respectable CD32 collection.

them to the DUP's already superior reviews to fashion the best gaming magazine

instead.  NOTE: The original AMIGA LINK magazine may be dissolving soon and
there is rumor of another version of AMIGA LINK.  ALG has no affiliation with
that magazine whatsoever.

        As of now, the primary author/editor of this magazine is Shane R.

        The magazine is dedicated completely to the entertainment aspect of

        Good luck everyone and remember to send those entries in NOW! Winners
will be announced here next month!  Have fun!



ANSWERS TO LAST MONTH'S TRIVIA QUESTIONS:

1. Foursfield's game of BRAT.  This game is an excellent challenging and funny
'arcade strategy' kinda game.  Highly recommended if you can still find it.

2. The sound clips was a bunch of bad guys getting drilled in the VISION/ACID
game ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE II.  If you listen close, some of the sound effects
there can be heard in Black Magic's new game GLOOM.

3. Only one person got the music right to this game from Ocean.  The game of
course was THE LOST PATROL.  I was amazed!

4. The company's name that made the cool games SUPER HUEY, SLINKY, CAVERNS OF
KHAFKA and more was COSMI, of which Paul Norman was the genius behind their
games.

5. God did this one ever stir up the mess!  No, it is NOT Battle Chess. NO NO
NO NO!  Most people were sticking to this like glue.  The game, for those of
you elderly enough to remember, was ARCHON released by Electronic Arts (when
they were cool) and developed by the FREEFALL ASSOCIATION.  The female queried
in last month's trivia was ANNE WESTFALL.
