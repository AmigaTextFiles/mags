Welcome to the May 1996 issue of the GAC
FLAK. This time the Archive has changed
substantially. Since external bitmaps
are now supported in PageStream3, I have
kept all the bitmapped graphics external
and included the appropriate files in
the format mentioned in the March and
April readme files.

In order to avoid problems while loading
simply extract the archive whereever you
want, then assign GAC_NL: to whereever
the GAC_NL directory winds up. When
loading the various pages, PageStream3
will look in GAC_NL:graphics for the
bitmaps.
