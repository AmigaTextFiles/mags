- Due to the popular demand, Elastic Reality (formerly known as ASDG) has
  been aquired as part of a merger with AVID Technology, based in Tewksbury,
  USA. From a press release by AVID Technology: 

  We still greatly value our Amiga customers and want to provide you with
  the best support that we are able but due to the afore mentioned changes,
  things will be somewhat different than they were in the past for our 
  Amiga customers. The most major chage is that we will no longer be able
  to offer telephone (voice) support to our Amiga customers. This is 
  regrettable but as we no longer maintain support of any our products at
  our Madison, WI site, this is the only way we can still offer support to
  our Amiga customers.
  The other major change is that we are no longer offering unlimited
  technical support of our Amiga products. This is being done to keep in
  line with our (and AVID's) technical support policy which provides 90 
  days of free support after purchase. This policy started (retroactively)
  on June 1, 1995 for all currently registered owners of ERI Amiga 
  products. AVID policy for support after the initial 90 days have expired
  is to purchase a one (1) year technical support extension package (this
  is subject to change for ERI Amiga products).
  ERI's Amiga products are still available for sale. Call (608)273-6585 and
  hold for the operator and let then now you are interested in purchasing
  an Amiga product.
  ERI's Amiga technical support is available via fax, mail or online 
  services.

- Soft-Logik is about to release a PageStream patch version 3.0h.
  This is the eighth free update patch to PageStream3. This update
  implements most of the remaining text features such as automatic
  hyphenation, paragraph spacing and page numbering. As you can tell
  from the Changes list below, this is the most important update yet
  and the program is getting much closer to complete!
  Typing speed has been improved in this version by 25% in frames with
  small amounts of text, and by 300% in frames with large amounts of
  text! Many other text speed improvements have been made, including
  improved memory handling. Text is still slower than we would like,
  but it is definitely better!
  Non-PostScript printing speed has been improved in some cases. (See
  Technical Notes for details.) Soft-Logik plans to significantly
  increase the speed of all non-PostScript black and white (Ordered
  and Halftone) printing for v3.1.
  Soft-Logik plans one more interim update (3.0i). It will finish most
  of the remaining object features including the Pen and Reshape tools.
  After 3.0i Soft-Logik will complete 3.0 and renumber it to 3.1. This
  is the long-awaited free update. v3.1 will be available online for
  approximately one month before Soft-Logik send out any free updates.
  This will give Soft-Logik a chance to ensure it's solid before sending
  out updates. If you've downloaded the patches, Soft-Logik recommends
  getting the 3.1 patch so you can get PageStream 3.1 as soon as
  possible.

  The new version 3.0h has following changes compare to version 3.0g:

  - OPENING/SAVING AND IMPORTING/EXPORTING:
    - Implemented Revert to Saved.
    - Implemented external articles and graphics. FPOs (see page 221) are
      not created yet, so bitmap pictures must still be imported in their
      entirety. File notification is not yet implemented.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented a few users from importing or opening
      some files. Symptoms included not being able to open a PageStream2
      document and not being able to import a graphic from a floppy disk.
    - Fixed canceling of graphic export which gave a recoverable alert.
    - Fixed a bug with enforcer hits with AutoSave.
    - Fixed a bug that distorted some scaled drawings in documents when
      the documents were reloaded.
    - Removed the "Line has LF" option from the ProWrite import requester
      which was not applicable to this format.
    - Fixed a problem with colors being added to the palette incorrectly
      when importing drawings.
    - Export DR2D line weight problem fixed.

  - DOCUMENT STRUCTURE:
    - Implemented page numbering. Inserting a page number variable now
      works as expected.
    - Fixed the problem with deleting a master page currently in use.
    - Fixed the enforcer hit problem with inserting pages.
    - Implemented the keyboard shortcuts for changing pages: Go to Page
      (Ctrl G), Go to Last Viewed Page (Shift Ctrl G), Previous Page
      (Ctrl J), First Page (Shift Ctrl J), Next Page (Ctrl K), and Last
      Page (Shift Ctrl K).
    - Added a verification requester for deleting pages.
    - Entering out of range values into the New Document requester will
      no longer crash PageStream.

  - TEXT AND FONTS:
    - Implemented Paragraph Spacing.
    - Implemented Auto Hyphenation.
    - Changed Auto Hyphenation to default to Off instead of On. Changed
      the default Auto Hyphenation values from 4,2,2,2,0.5" to 5,3,2,3,
      0.25" (order of options in the requester), which we think are more
      suitable defaults.
    - Implemented Insert Soft Hyphen.
    - Fixed most known insertion point (text cursor) related problems.
      The blinking cursor you see on screen will now accurately reflect
      where it really is. (If you place the cursor in a linked series of
      frames containing no text, it will appear in the last one at this
      time. Ignore this error for now.)
    - Fixed the crash problem with double/triple clicking to select.
    - Fixed auto kerning of PostScript fonts.
    - Fixed inserting of date and time variables.
    - Fixed disappearing fi, fl, oe, ae... characters in some of the
      standard fonts. Non-existant ligatures were being substituted for
      these. Updated 'fm' files that solve the problem are included with
      this version.
    - Fixed several problems with rotated text.
    - Fixed a problem with reordering and applying tabs.
    - Implemented the Manual Kern requester sample display.
    - Added a "Remove" gadget to the Manual Kern requester. This removes
      the applied manual kerning.
    - To remove manual kerning from a block of text, you no longer have
      to hold down a Shift key while choosing Manual Kern.
    - Moved the overset indicator to directly below the bottom right
      corner of overset text frames, and fixed the "hotspot" for picking
      up text frame linking.
    - Previous versions of PageStream3 required that lines of text be at
      least 0.5" long. Creating text columns narrower than this resulted
      in not being able to enter text. The reason for this 'feature' is
      to prevent bad typesetting with wordwrap. It has been changed so
      that if the minimum line length is greater than half the width of
      the column, it is ignored. This means it will still work as
      intended for text wrap, but you can now create columns as narrow as
      you want.

  - PRINTING, ALL TYPES:
    - Implemented the Print Blank Page option in Print.
    - Fixed printing of a range of pages in a chapter.
    - Fixed printing of a single chapter.
    - Fixed the display of units in the Printing Preferences requester,
      which ignored your measurement system default.
    - Fixed the distorted aspect ratio problem with bitmap pictures.
    - Fixed the distorted aspect ratio problem with landscape printing.
    - Fixed an enforcer hit problem with printing gradient fills to non-
      PostScript printers.

  - POSTSCRIPT PRINTER DRIVER:
    - If a PPD can't be loaded, it will now display an alert explaining
      why. The information provided by the alert requester should be
      reported to the printer manufacturer, because it is their error.
      Some Lexmark, Autologic and Varityper PPD files have been found to
      have basic errors.
    - Fixed the reversed vertical offset for radial fills.

  - HP PRINTER DRIVER:
    - Now remembers your default paper size.

  - FARGO PRINTER DRIVER:
    - Fixed Dye Sub Mono printing, which printed negative.

  - OBJECTS:
    - Clicking anywhere within an object's bounding box will no longer
      select it. Object selection now works as explained in the manual.
    - Fixed drawing with the Polygon tool.
    - Fixed the vertical offset and default rotation values in Transform.
    - Moving and resizing a frame now redraws the overset indicator if
      applicable.
    - Fixed an enforcer hit problem with displaying gradient fills.
    - Fixed problems with turning off text wrap.
    - Fixed the problem with pulling object size handles over the
      opposite size handles (negative resizing).

  - COLOR:
    - Fixed editing a library-based color which could default to the
      wrong color library.
    - Editing an imported color now changes it to a non-imported color.
     (The "imported" icon will no longer be shown next to it in the
     color lists.)

  - INTERFACE:
    - You can now press the Esc key to exit any requester in PageStream3
      or BME2 that has a Cancel gadget. Like pressing Return for the
      default gadget, the text cursor cannot be in a text gadget when you
      press Esc. If it is in a text gadget, press Return to exit the
      gadget and then Esc to cancel the requester.
    - Added a "Technical Support" command to the Settings menu above
      Help. This opens the online help system to the Technical Support
      Options section.
    - Fixed multiplication and division in text gadgets when using units
      other than the current measurement system.
    - Changed multiline text gadgets and non-editable text strings to
      break lines on slashes and dashes, in addition to spaces. This
      prevents unnecessary wordwrap in the Navigator's Tips gadget.
    - Corrected the text gadget tab order in the New Document and Edit
      Master Page requesters.
    - Modified the Tab and Paragraph Format requesters so that 6
      characters can be seen in the text gadgets in which you may enter
      unicode characters.
    - PageStream and BME now accept unaccented characters for keyboard
      shortcuts in requesters even if the character has an accent. For
      example, you can type "o" instead of "v". This is not of concern to
      users of the English version of PageStream3.

  - MISCELLANEOUS:
    - Fixed the fatal error that occurred when you opened a document or
      created a new one and the default view magnification was set to a
      percentage size. (Anything other than Full Page or Full Width.)
   - Fixed Cut, Copy, Paste, Erase and Undo toolbar buttons.
   - Fixed copying of objects between documents which also copied text
     style tags.
   - The Edit palette is now updated when you undo an action.
   - Margin guides for double-sided master pages now work correctly.
   - Toggling Show Rulers off no longer redraws the screen.
   - The About requester picture (splash screen) was reduced in size by
     10%, so it should display more quickly.

  - SEND TO EDITOR:
    - Fixed all send to editor scripts to work properly when quitting an
      editor and not just when closing an editor's window.
    - Fixed the spell check in PageLiner problem that returned the
      article to PageStream with no changes.
    - If PageStream3 is run from a Shell, Send to Editor will no longer
      output to the Shell that the hotlinked files have been deleted.

  - OTHER MACRO SCRIPTS:
    - "Duplicate To Page" is now an internal macro rather than an
      external script. There was no need for it to use ARexx, and it's
      faster as an internal macro.
    - New "Clear Ruler Guides" internal macro. This deletes all guides
      set with the Set Guides requester for the current master page.
    - Corrected the Open Template macro data for Avery labels size 5162.

  - MACRO RECORDING:
    - Fixed recording the insertion of unicode characters in requesters.
      An extra backslash is inserted when recording setting the bullet
      character in Paragraph Format or the fill character in Tabs so that
      these macros can be played back successfully. If the macro is
      exported, the second backslash will be removed automatically.
    - Fixed recording the playback of another macro. Instead of ignoring
      the played back macro as explained on page 341, it will now record
      the actions of the macro.

  - MACRO COMMANDS:
    - New commands: setlanguage, revertdocument.
    - Added new parameters for: setpagenumbering, getpagenumbering,
      setchapternumbering, getchapternumbering, insertnumber, insertdate,
      inserttime, insertrevision, insertsoft, sethyphenlanguage,
      deletepage.
    - GetChoice: button 1 is now the default gadget, and button 2 is the
      gadget which will be activated by the Esc key.
    - AddARexxGadget: the second exit button added will now be the gadget
      activated by the Esc key.
    - Fixed a problem with changing pages from a macro when no document
      windows were open.

  - HELP SYSTEM:
    - Made the tips accessible from the help system's main contents
      screen. Note that the tips cannot be wordwrapped in AmigaDOS 2
      AmigaGuide, so you will have to scroll the help screen horizontally
      to read each paragraph. The tips will be properly formatted if you
      have AmigaDOS 3.
    - Added a list of clip art companies to the help system. (Accessible
      from the main Contents screen.)
    - Now lists new manual errata corrections with an asterisk.
    - Corrected a few nodes that did not link to the correct sections.

  - PAGELINER:
    - Fixed a problem with using the getarticle macro command during spell
      checking.

  - BME:
    - Fixed a bug with the Clone feature. Cloned pictures would crash BME
      when closed.
    - Fixed the problem with the right half (or more) of a picture being
      displayed incorrectly when viewed at less than 100%. This happened
      only with less than 24 bit RGB and less than 32 bit CMYK pictures.
    - Fixed the potential crash problem with zooming in on pictures that
      were less than 24 bit RGB or less than 32 bit CMYK pictures.
    - Fixed the incorrect color problem when editing a 24 bit picture, or
      converting a picture to 24 bits.
    - Move the default path options from the Settings/General command to
      the new Settings/Paths command to make BME more like PageStream.
    - Editing a palette picture's colors now sets the picture status
      indicator.
    - Now sets the foreground and background colors correctly when you
      convert a picture to another type.
    - Can now click in the gray area outside of a picture to deselect an
      area.
    - You can now use the Backspace key to delete a selected area.
    - Improved the Sharpen and Emboss effects. They now work better than
      before at the edges of the picture.
    - Improved the speed of the Contrast and Brightness effects.

  This free upgrade patch will be available in AmiNet.

-  Soft-Logik's BitMapEditor (BME) is now available in a new version (BME2)
   . BME2 has a number of useful effects, including Pixelize, Brightness,
   Contrast, Emboss and the new Gary's Effects. This set of exciting 
   effects is plug and play simple. Just install them and twelve new menu
   commands will appear the next time you run BME! Apply these effects to
   an entire image or to a selected area. The new effects are:

   - Solarize, allows you to set the threshold above which pixels are 
     negated. The resulting effect is a combination of positive and 
     negative images
   - Median, streamlines pixel values to make colors more consistent
   - Average, similar to Median, but more suitable for some pictures
   - Minimum, spreads out dark areas and shrinks bright areas
   - Maximum, spreads out bright areas and shrinks dark areas
   - Equalize, evens out pixel values to make shadow details more apparent
   - Threshold, sets the cutoff point for conversion to black and white
   - Hue/Saturation, changes the hue and saturation of all colors at once
   - Gamma, brightens the middle range of gray levels without losing
     significant detail
   - Blur, takes off sharp edges by eliminating noise
   - Histogram, graphs the distribution of color values. Use before and
     after applying other effects to see their results
   - Convolve, this offers total control and has 20 presets, including:
     - Gaussian Blur: to add haze;
     - Gaussian Sharpen: to remove haze;
     - Laplacian Edge Enhancement: to highlight edges and darken other 
       areas;
     - Low-Pass: to enhance dark areas;
     - High-Pass: to emphasize bright areas;
     - Vertical Smooth: to smooth NTSC video images
   
  These are only a few of the presets. You can also load and save your own,
  and control all of the effects with ARexx.
  These effects are easy to use and fun to experiment with. Try an effect
  with its default settings, and if you don't like the results, simply
  choose Undo, change the effect's slider gadget, and try it again. If you
  use pictures in PageStream3, you need Gary's Effects to give your
  pictures the right look. 

  Gary's Effects is available now from Soft-Logik for $25 US.

  ScreamerNet systems.) T-Net will administer rendering multiple LightWave
  3D scenes among several machines. You can even identify specific frames
  to render. There are also provisions to adjust resolution, anti-aliasing
  level, raytracing options, etc.  right from the interface.
  There is extensive real-time information about rendering activity and
  statistics. T-Net will even send messages to alpha-numeric pagers on
  rendering status and problems. It is highly configurable as to who it
  should page in different situations as well as back up pagers to notify.
  T-Net also features the ability to remotely control any of the nodes
  from a single Amiga. It is very quick, though not as fast as really
  being on the remote machine.

- Blevins Enterprises offers VertiSketch, a 3D digitizing system for
  LightWave. The Model I10 has a robotic-like arm with a pointer on the 
  end. The device can triangulate the location of the tip of the pointer
  in 3D space. The points appear right in the LightWave Modeler display
  and the polygons are automatically built.
  All of the VertiSketch models being used had thread adhered to their
  surfaces forming a grid net. The pointer was then placed at intersecting
  lines on the grid.

- Tahoe Software is selling QuickText version 2.0, yet another presentation
  system for the Amiga. The working environment of QuickText revolves 
  around layers of screens, on which you can place IFF pictures in up to
  HAM8 as backgrounds, add text, change colors, etc. A background animation
  can be substituted for the picture. Text handling exploits all of the 
  features of the standard Amiga font system (bold, italic, shadow, etc).
  Each text block is catalogued for easy editing after the fact. Variables
  can be used in text blocks and updated in real-time, most useful for 
  scoreboard displays.
  Screens can be added at will, with six standard wipe patterns for
  transitions. Each screen can have its own set of characteristics (high/
  low res, interlaced/non, and palette information). On-screen doodling is
  supported, and may be recorded for playback at a later time. A clock may
  be brought up on the screen and started/stopped at will.
  ARexx support is extensive, offering 61 commands for QuickText's more
  useful or repetitive features. QuickText can generate stereograms out
  of the present screen.
  QuickText is what it is-a program designed to work best in either a 
  kiosk-video board environment, or as an effect and title generator
  combined with a genlock (hence scoreboard and clock, and text scroll
  options).
  Priced at $60 US, Tahoe offers a demo disk and short demo tape. A demo
  version of QuickText is uploaded to AmiNet.

  Imaging Protocol (HIIP) from Elastic Reality, Inc. for inclusion in
  NewTek's Emmy award winning Video Toaster and LightWave 3D products. As a
  result of this license, Video Toaster and LightWave 3D users will have
  seamless connectivity to the most important image file formats in the 
  film, television and multimedia industries. HIIP is a single unified

  frees users from having to remember an image's format or having to adhere
  to a rigid file naming convention. HIIP's flexible sizing and color space
  conversion capabilities give NewTek customers the creative freedom to be
  able to always use the right image for any desired purpose.  "Being
  available for the Silicon Graphics, Amiga, Windows, and Macintosh 
  platforms, HIIP provides a universal link between the growing number of
  platforms supported by LightWave 3D". HIIP's inclusion in the Toaster

- MacroSystem Development is shipping accelerator boards in various 
  configurations for both the Amiga 4000 and 3000, with built-in SCSI-2 
  Fast DMA controllers. The high-end versions sport 40MHz `040 CPUs, while
  the low-end model for the A4000 allows you to transplant your existing
  25MHz `040 chip and RAM to the WarpEngine for up to a 100- percent speed
  increase. A4000 WarpEngines can hold up to 128MB of RAM (using 32MB 
  SIMMs) while the A3000 versions top out at 64MB.
  Any of the WarpEngines can be upgraded to a 40MHz `040 and 50MHZ 68060.
  TransWarpEngine, the 68060 baby, will be available for Amiga 2000/3000/
  4000. A multiprocesser Warp Engine that can carry upto 4, 68060 CPU is
  planned. Soon to be released is a 50MHz card for the Amiga 3000,  called
  the ImpulsEngine, that will double the speed of a 3000 and add up to 64MB
  of additional RAM. The board is expected to sell, sans RAM, for under 
  $500 US.

- Oliver Kastl of Elaborate Bytes has now released a4000_atapi.device 
  version 8.2. This device allows you to use an ATAPI CD-ROM drive with
  the A4000 or A4000T embedded IDE controller. A4000 users can use the very
  popular and cheap CD-Roms for PCs without any major disadvantages against
  SCSI CD-Rom drives. The major advantage for A4000 users without a SCSI 
  controller is, that they don't have to buy one. The major advantage for
  A4000 users with a SCSI controller is, that they have an unused IDE port
  in their machine anyway and SCSI CD-Roms are usually more expensive.
  The device maps SCSI-II commands to ATAPI packets using the standard 
  Commodore HD_SCSICMD interface, so any "CD-Rom specific" programs 
  (Multisession Filsystems, Audio Players and Photo-CD readers) designed 
  for SCSI-II CD-Roms should work.
  This has been tested with CacheCDFS, PlayCD, CD32-Emulator and PhotoWorX.
  The device is fully interrupt driven and will use only a small amount of
  CPU time for the transfer. A demo version is uploaded to AmiNet.
  The new version 8.2 features:

  - Intermediate fixes - mainly to the Chinon OEM version
  - Revised to fully comply with ATAPI 1.2 specs. All ATAPI devices which
    comply with Atapi 1.2 should work, including non CD-Roms (e.g. Tape
    devices). Removed Elitegroup Vertos from compatibility list - this 
    one doesn't comply with ATAPI specs 1.2.
  - Merged a4000_atapi and a1200_atapi to a single atapi.device Checking,
    which devices are connected to the IDE port changed again -this should
    fix the reported problems of "FindCD" hangs.
  - Mitsumi FX-300 and old FX-400 apparently hangs. This is a bug in the
    Mitsumi firmware. Added a workaround for this. CD-Rom can be reset on
    Open, if the device is opened with device flags 1.
  - Emulates SCSI 6 byte Mode Sense / Mode Select. This is important for
    some SCSI Audio players and Shapeshifter to work properly.

- Joseph Thomas has just released the long awaited Fitter version 2.0. 
  Fitter is a program that automates the copying of files from your hard
  drive to floppy disks, although any device(s) can be used as a source
  and destination. Fitter automatically keep track of where your files
  are for easy retreival.  Fitter is ideal if you collect GIFs, MODs,
  demos, programs, etc. while on the 'net or your on-line service.
  The new version 2.0 features: 

	- Online Amigaguide help by using the Help key
	- The Add Files routine has been completely rewritten. Fitting now
    happens on the fly, instead of creating a fitting list before the
    session starts. Files are "fitted" dynamically.	Many aspects of Add
    Files have been automated for better ease of use, and practicality
	- An exlusive copy program was written for Fitter, internally. A choice
    between using this one and AmigaDOS COPY is always available. Fitter's
    copy has a % completed indicator, and can	be interrupted or aborted at
    any time. You can even summon on line help *during* the copy!
  - An Add Files progress log is maintained for Add Files sessions
  - Disk formatting now spawns a CON: window showing the progress of the
    AmigaDOS FORMAT command
  - Fitter now performs block-based fits, to give superior efficiency. In
    other words, Fitter determines a file "fit" on the disks by checking
    blocks available
  - Fitter has been enhanced with an entirely new	window/feature: the 
    Search & Deletion window. In this window, you can now interactively
    scan the contents of your disk catalog, search for files, perform 
    deletions to your disks and catalog, and more.  Fitter keeps an 
    ongoing log of your deletions
  - Fitter now has automatic (and interactive) 'discrepancy	checking'. This
    feature automatically informs you if your disk's contents are not 
    consistent with your catalog and performs updates accordingly. This
    feature activates just about whenever you insert a disk from your
    catalog.
  - Fitter still contains the convenient and quick file comment adding/
    editing feature.  Make use of the filenote the way AmigaDOS designers
    intended you to
  - And much more

  Fitter version 2.0 is available in AmiNet.

- ImageLab Technology has just released the first release of Image Vision
  the long awaited and all new multimedia program for the Amiga.
  Image Vision is a new and very exciting multimedia development platform.
  It will give you the ability to create a powerful interactive 
  presentation with ease. A lot of work has been put into the user
  interface to make it simple and intuitive. Being built from modules,
  Image Vision is also very flexible. Any new feature that comes along can
  be installed without any changes to the main program.
  After using several different MultiMedia tools for a while, programmers
  at ImageLab Technology felt that none of these tools were flexible enough
  to provide with an environment that would stay "fresh". Therefore they
  decided to create an environment that was able to meet the demands the
  fast developing Information Technology have on software today. It ended
  up to be Image Vision. Many different aspects have been taken into 
  account to give the Image Vision environment the flexibility that the
  user want. A lot of work has been put into the design and performance of
  Image Vision. The interface is very easy to use and many different input
  possibilites are supported. Every function the environment provides can
  be accessed through icons, which makes working with Image Vision very
  intuitive. There is an online help system available at all times to make
  the amount of time spent with the manual minimal. Image Vision has been
  coded around an API that will allow porting to other platforms. This 
  makes Image Vision very versatile as you are not limited to one single
  platform, and the projects you create can be exported to the supported
  platforms without any conversions whatsoever. The modularity of Image 
  Vision makes it possible to configure the environment in a large number
  of ways, giving it that personal touch. New features can be added and old
  can be removed at will. Third part developers are able to make modules so
  that Image Vision supports certain specific products. Image Vision is
  totally multitasking. You may run other programs in the background, or 
  you may run Image Vision in the background. Image Vision is designed to
  provide a carefree, multithread, and multitasking environment, which is
  guaranteed to be flawless. To make the runtime part of Image Vision as
  effective as possible even the runtime processes are multitasking.
  Currently four processes are giving you the maximum performance. As you
  can see, Image Vision is truly a multitasking environemnt in more ways
  than one. It can be made general to support many different setups, or it
  can be made to support only a specific setup. The options are only 
  limited by the user, and not by the development of the Information 
  Technology. The first version of Image Vision features:

  - Easy to use drag'n'drop interface
  - Draw and manipulate your own graphical objects with the drawing tools
  - A comprehensive and intelligent online documentation that is accessible
    at all times
  - A fully working multithread multitasking environment
  - Total modularity that will make upgrades very easy and inexpensive

  A prerelease demo version is available at no charge.

- MRsoftware has just released a new version 2.2.0 of MRBackUp professional
  . MRBackup is a hard disk backup program for the Amiga family of 
  computers.  It provides a wide range of services to support Amiga file
  management and backup/restore of files to/from hard disk.  Files can be
  backed up to:

  - Floppy disk, in AmigaDOS format
  - Floppy disk, in a special "fast" format
  - Any sequential file or device (local or networked) in "fast" format
  - SCSI streaming tape

  A saveset catalog file is created for each saveset, allowing quick
  retrieval of individual files when necessary.  Should the catalog file
  become damaged or lost, MRBackup can recreate it by scanning the
  saveset.
  MRBackup is designed to behave well in your Amiga's multi-tasking
  environment.  It does not "take over the machine" and will allow you to
  use your Amiga for other activities while backups are being performed. 
  MRBackup is controlled by a flexible set of user-configurable parameters
  and offers a wide range of backup and restore options. Its Intuition-
  based user interface is designed for a pleasing appearance and ease of
  operation.
  MRBackup uses the Amiga's speech capabilities to provide an effective
  means for presenting prompts, error conditions and requests for floppy
  disk insertions, etc.
  MRBackup provides optional data compression which will reduce the number
  of diskettes (or other media) required for a backup.

- After one year in the development the state of the art Sequencer/Tracker/
  Sampling software for the Amiga, OctaMed, is now finally released in an
  all new version 6.0. Summary of main features in the new version:

  - Dynamic Screen mode selection, RTFSWB:
    RTFSWB stands for "Real Time Font Sensitive Window Builder". It is a
    simple GUI design "language" which contains commands like GBOOL
    (creates a boolean gadget) or TXT (creates a text item). When a window
    is opened, RTFSWB does the layout of the window according to the 
    currently selected font. As the name says, it is fully font sensitive,
    supporting both non-proportional and proportional fonts. RTFSWB greatly
    improves the outlook of OctaMED, especially on high resolution screens
    with bigger fonts. There are some more GUI changes besides RTFSWB; 
    there is no longer a default backdrop window, but all parts of the user
    interface are now in windows for better configurability. OctaMED screen
    has also become public; other applications may open windows on it.
  - ARexx:
    Yes, as most self-respecting applications, OctaMED now has an ARexx
    port! Most features of OctaMED are available for use by external
    programs or scripts. This means that users can add new features by
    simply writing an ARexx script. In version 6.0, OctaMED's keyboard
    shortcuts are also totally implemented via the ARexx interface; each
    shortcut is mapped to an ARexx command. The shortcuts are user-
    modifiable. You can use the AREXX port to make your own tools. As a
    simple example of using AREXX port of OctaMed you could subtract five
    from all instances of the 0Cxx command on instrument 5 - and 
    automatically set up the program when you start it up.
  - Improved soundcard support:
    The last V5 revisions added Aura support. V6 supports MacroSystem's
    Toccata as well. Currently only one sample can be played through it at
    a time, but this will change in the future (see below).
    Both soundcards support stereo output, and OctaMED now supports stereo
    samples (They can be used even without a soundcard).
    Because 16-bit samples are now becoming more and more common on the
    Amiga, OctaMED supports many new sample formats: MAUD (Toccata's file
    format), Audio IFF (perhaps the most common multi-platform sample 
    format) and RIFF WAVE (these are the PC .WAV files).
  - Improved sample editor:
    The sample editor has a lot of new features. The sample display is now
    significantly faster and it has a new zooming slider. The speed 
    improvement is optional, however, as it consumes some memory.
    New editing operations include an overwriting Paste, vertical 
    adjustment of the sample, tuning tone, Add Workspace window, plus more.
    Also, the ultra-slow sampling Monitor window has been replaced with a
    faster monitor screen.
  - File handling:
    Packer support is now "finished", I suppose (nothing more to add). XPK
    is supported for both compression and decompression, with a parameter
    window for selecting the compression type. A similar window exists for
    PowerPacker parameters.
    Standard MIDI File (SMF) saving was added during Spring -94. Due to 
    lack of time, I didn't intend to add SMF loading to V6. However, 
    eventually Ray decided that this feature should be added, so it exists
    now, and it seems to work pretty well, although SMF->OctaMED conversion
    is not quite straight-forward.
    A popular request to Ray was the ability to save modules directly as
    executable files, and this is now possible.
    Executables are about 12 kilobytes longer than the corresponding module
    itself and they cannot be loaded and re-mixed by other composers and
    then re-released then anothers work. 
    Many users have the need of writing information about a song or its
    author, or perhaps about the MIDI setup the song uses. You can now
    embed text files in modules.
    Finally, OctaMED now uses four different icons for different types of
    files. The icons now have eight colours, and they can be modified/
    replaced by the user.
  - Player
    There are no new player commands, however, One feature is worth
    mentioning, you can now have several commands besides a note. This is
    carried out by having "command pages". Each block can have 1 - 32767
    pages, each one containing a different set of commands (usually no 
    more than three are used), Shift-Tab cycles between the command pages.
    For example, to combine slide, vibrato and volume change, you could
    have the following command pages:
    Page 1 (slide):     Page 2 (vibr.):     Page 3 (vol chg):
    C-2 10000       04A6            0D01
    --- 00102       0400            0D01

  - Miscellaneous:
    - You can free and reallocate audio channels at any time. This is handy
      , as you don't need to quit OctaMED in order to use another program
      that requires the audio channels.
    - Slow HQ allows pre-V5 HQ mode tempo compatibility. Speaking of tempos
      , there's a new window for rough tempo conversions between SPD<->BPM
      and four channel <-> eight channel modes.
    - Instruments can be disabled. This is much like setting the 
      instrument's volume to 0, but not quite, as the default volume 
      setting can be overridden with player commands. By the way, 
      Instrument Parameters window updating has been optimized, and it's
      now faster.
    - A new Miscellaneous Options window with a lot of miscellaneous
      options such as: Close Workbench, Overwrite Requesters, Use ReqTools,
      Warn if Disk Full etc.
    - Block/track/range editing operations now have three separate buffers.
    - The Block List window can mark unused blocks, if desired.
    - From now on, OctaMED requires operating system 2.04 or later, but
      OctaMEDPlayer, although upgraded, still only requires Kickstart/WB
      1.2 or higher to run.
    - OctaMED and OctaMEDPlayer now support the AmigaGuide® system to
      provide on-line help, allowing you to press HELP at any time to get a
      complete manual in hypertext format.

- There are a lot of falsk rumoures around about how fast a Pentium can
  render a pictures using LightWave. A Motorola 68060/50 MHZ is 20% to 30%
  faster than an Intel Pentium 90 MHZ. At the latest CeBIT they
  demonstrated it. An Amiga equipped with a Cyberstorm 68060/50 MHZ run
  LightWave faster (55 sec for the test frame) than the Pentium 90MHZ 
  (70 secs for the same frame).
  Imagine Amiga version 3.2 was also 30% faster on the 68060/50 MHZ
  Amiga compare to imagine running on an IBM PC clone equipped with an
  Intel Pentium 90 MHZ.

- A new version 40.46 of the Cybergraphics intuition WB Emulation system is
  now  released. The cybergraphics system was designed to define an
  independant graphics standard for graphics boards. The developers 
  included all their knowledge of about 3 years of gfx board software
  development (wb-emulation of visiona, domino, picasso and CyberVision64).
  CyberGraphics is based on hardware dependant monitor drivers and hardware
  independant libraries. This has some advantages: Bug fixes in the 
  workbench emulation or speed optimizations is of benefit for ALL gfx
  boards that are supported by the CyberGraphics system. There is no third
  like XpERT or Village-Tronic inbetween developers and users. That 
  guarantees bug fixes and continued development of the software in the
  future. CyberGraphics allows using of 15/16/24 screens independant of the
  used color model. You are able to use the cybergraphics.library functions
  to modify this screens. At the time of this writing there are drivers for
  Maxon Cinema,Real 3D, ADPro, AmaxIV, PhotoWorx, Emplant, ImageFX and 
  Photogenics available. There is also a picture viewer called CyberView
  which can be found on AmiNet. Cybergraphics is the nicest, most promising
  RTG systems the Amiga has ever had. Because CyberGfx runs on nearly ALL 
  gfx cards floating around, you'll get much more support for drivers. 
  Applications using CyberGfx are raising, begining with ShapeShifter.
  Cybergraphics is not only a card-independent system (allowing one product
  to work on a variety of different graphics cards) but it is actually 
  significantly faster than the hardware specific drivers provided with
  most graphic cards. Cybergraphics is what EGS should have been - a FAST
  and simple extension to the standard Amiga libraries to allow programs to
  be converted simply to take advantage of 24-bit graphics, and still 
  maintain standard system compatibility with the same executable code.
  Support for Retina Z2, A2410, and Merlin graphic board are planed for a
  future version. Cybergraphics currently features:

  - Stable Workbench emulation
  - Dragable screens
  - No chipmem required for screen display
  - Modular design, it is possible to use multiple (and different) gfx 
    boards at one time
  - CyberGraphics based vilintuisup.library. As long as there exist not
    much cybergraphics 15/16/24 bit applications the old picassoII drivers
    may be used.
  - Uses cirrus blitter for plane to chunky conversion
  - The current version supports the following graphic board:
    - CyberVision 64
    - Picasso II (unsegmented mode)
    - GVP Spectrum
    - Piccolo Z2/Z3
    - Domino
    - Retina Z3
      Much better software that Macrosystems RetinaEmu version 2.3.
      Supports screen dragging enabled, screenmodes support etc. Support
      for Retina Blitter is comming with the next version of Cybergraphics.
    - Piccolo SD-64

- Martin Gierich (uj3w@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de) has just released a new version
  2.4 of ZShell, the powerfull Shell for the Amiga. ZShell is a small (30K)
  , fast and powerful Shell with 65 built-in commands. So it replaces most
  of the commands in the C: directory. It has powerful editing & history,
  file name completion, review buffer, some Kickstart 2.0/3.0 specific
  features and a lovely LIST command. For programmers ZShell has things
  like showing EXEC-lists and the task list, memory dumping and execution

  ZShell with console handlers like KingCON. ZShell features:

  - Usage is similar (or better) to the standard AmigaDOS shell
  - Supports the standard housekeeping commands which are builtin,
    so no disk access is necessary eg. list, dir, cd, assign, delete, copy,
    move, path, info, type
  - A total of 65 built-in commands
  - About 30K small (pure assembler code, source included)
  - Starting from Workbench (!) or CLI. No installation needed
  - File name completion by simply pressing TAB; shows all matches
  - Review-buffer to see again what scrolled out of the window
  - Some commands and debugging features for programmers
  - Command line editing better than OS2.0 Shell
  - Support of OS2.0+ and OS3.0+ specific features
  - DIR and LIST both sort (by default) and show file sizes
  - Wild cards and recursive processing
  - Makes itself resident for quicker starting and memory saving
  - Real (!) RUN and NEWCLI command that reenters ZShell quickly
  - Application-Window/-Icon
  - Simple 'MORE' type text viewer
  - Online Help function and AmigaGuide documentation with examples
  - Can create and show Hard- and Softlinks

  The new version 2.4 features:
  - Support for OS2.0+ specific stuff (MALELINK, MAKEICON, ASSIGN ADD,
    Application-Window etc.)
  - Totally rewrote PATH, COPY, DELETE, PROTECT, MOVE and JOIN
  - Bugfixes

  ZShell is available through Aminet:
  ftp://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/pub/aminet/util/shell/ZShell24.lha (197510)

- Black Belt Systems has finally released the long awaited Imagemaster R/t
  version 1.60 for the Amiga. IM R/t 1.60 expands the software's already
  impressive array of special effects to include enormously powerful 
  powerful plasma tools, other operational enhancements, expanded interface
  controls and additional documentation.
  Black Belt Systems continues to enhance Imagemaster R/t product, still
  the most flexible and powerful image manipulation system available for
  the Amiga, as well as offer full time technical support to the customers.
  More important reasons why Imagemaster R/t is the right choice for your
  Amiga image manipulation software! The new version of IM R/t features:

  The plasma suite can generate flame events in still frames or over
  time. A number of useful types of flames are available, including gas
  flames, candles, log and forest fires, and even the oil wick of a
  hurricane lamp.  This is only the tip of the iceberg, however, as all
  flame parameters are settable by the user. For instance, independent
  control over the flame's base, middle, end and tip colors allow you to
  tailor the burn even to rare metals such as sodium or magnesium with
  no trouble. You have control over how much the flame distorts the
  background behind it, turbulence within the flame and much, much more.
  Also in the plasma suite is an extensive electrical generator which
  excels at lightning and other electrical effects. Preset or "canned"
  effects include Summer Storm, Windstorm, Fibrous and Gamma Bursts. As
  with the flame capability, these are only a hint of the range of
  effects available. You have direct control over color, glow, zagging,
  saturation, taper, width and more.  As with the flame tools all
  controls may be animated over time using ARexx, resulting in
  travelling bolts and strikes with an astounding level of realism.
  IM R/t 1.60 contains many other changes and improvements, including
  the ability to force all screens to 4-bit, 8-bit, or AGA, something
  that should help the performance of many of the weaker AGA emulations
  for the various graphics boards available for the Amiga.

    HTML-Heaven environment. (tooltypes etc.)
  - HTML-Wizard, This new addition to the suite is functionally the same as
    HTML-Genie, but it uses cycle gadgets instead of listview ones.

  - Workbench 2.04 or above
  - ARexx (bundled with Workbench 2.04 and above.)

- C-Born Software Systems has just released a new version 1.42 of AmigaFax.
  The new version has support for Class 2 Fax like USR fax modems.
  AmigaFax is a software package that, in combination with a FaxModem,
  allows you to send and receive facsimile information from your Amiga.
  Received faxes can be viewed, printed, forwarded to other fax machines,
  and saved as ILBM files. You can transmit text, ILBM graphics, and
  combinations of these as faxes. Using the AmigaFax command language
  you can add text from any Amiga font, along with logos and ILBM graphics,
  to create high quality multi-page fax documents. AmigaFax can be set up
  to automatically send documents to multiple recipients, to send faxes at
  or after set times, to answer incoming fax calls automatically, and even
  to forward received faxes (useful as a vacation mechanism). AmigaFax is
  highly configurable, allowing you to set up a custom environment that
  best suits your hardware and way of working. The current version of the
  AmigaFax features:

  - Automatic Reception:
    AmigaFax may be configured to receive faxes in the background, or to
    answer an already ringing line in Fax mode. Autoanswer may also be
    integrated with a UUCP or BBS environment, where incoming calls may be
    Fax or data, by using a specially modified version of the getty program
    that recognises Fax calls.
  - Automatic Transmission:
    Faxes may be queued for transmission after a particular time, to
    take advantage of lower off-peak telecom rates, for example. You
    may specify the number of times to try before giving up on
    transmission, and the period at which retry attempts should be
    made. All call progress is logged, and progress may be monitored
    from the main program. Call logging displays when attempts were
    made, the success or failure of the call, and the Called Number ID
    of the remote Fax machine reached.
  - Multiple Recipients:
    Fax numbers may be entered either directly, or using defineable
    aliases. Therefore instead of sending to `99123456', you could
    send it to `Fred'. In the same way, an alias can refer to a list
    of other aliases, or numbers, so that one fax could be sent to
    `Customers', representing a list of customers.
  - Flexible Fax Viewer:
    The Fax viewer allows you to view a fax document at scales of from
    1:1 to 1:8. A 1:3 scale igenerally gives a quite readable image
    while still fitting the entire Fax width across a standard Amiga
    screen. You can easily zoom in on areas of particular interest if
    required. The viewer may be configured to take advantage of new
    display modes (eg Productivity) and add-in high resolution display
    cards (eg Retina).
  - Powerful Document Builder:
    This allows you to mix any Amiga font or ILBM graphic on a page,
    to include text, ILBM, Fax, or AmigaFax command files anywhere on
    a page or in a document, perform alignment at character or pixel
    level, justify text regardless of font size, automatically add
    standard information such as address, signature, logo, and current
    time/date. Text conversion includes selectable fonts size and
    styles, including underline, bold and italic.
  - TeX to fax conversion:
    The `dvifax' program (registered version only) allows TeX `dvi'
    files to be converted directly to fax files.
  - Fax Printer-Driver:
    The fax printer driver allows the output of wordprocessing, DTP,
    painting and drawing programs to be converted directly to fax
    files.
  - Highly User Configurable:
    The configuration file allows you to set the system up to suit your
    requirements. You can define your prefered editor for text and for
    graphics, set a standard file to use as a template when creating
    new Fax documents, customize your dial type (pulse/tone, special
    prefix to get outside line, etc), set the Caller ID string to
    identify yourself to remote Fax machines, define the modem type
    you are using, and set many system default values.
  - Multiple Serial Port Support:
    Using the A2232 multi-serial port card, AmigaFax can support
    multiple FaxModems simultaneously, each modem being able to
    transmit and receive facsimiles and data.
  - Uses Preferences Printer:
    Because the Amiga Preferences printer is used to print out the
    documents, you can tradeoff speed for resolution as you require.
  - Workbench or CLI interface:
    AmigaFax can be run either from the workbench, or from a shell or
    CLI interface. In either case, an easy to use graphical
    presentation makes operation straightforward.

  Priced at $50 US, this nice piece of software may be ordered directly
  from C-Born Software Systems. Payment may be via MasterCard, Visa, 
  BankCard, or Bank Cheque, in Australian dollars.

- Jeff Shepherd announces the immediate relase of the Amiga port of Pine
  (tm) version 3.91. Pine is an integrated mail/news client for UNIX and
  now the Amiga. With Pine you can read your mail either locally or
  remotely with little work. Pine comes with a built-in editor for 
  composing email or news replies or you can use your personal editor.
  Pine has the ability of placing attachments to your email using MIME
  and spawning external viewers to view attachments you have received.
  Pine can use SMTP to post your message or use another mailer if you
  desire.  Pine has a wide variety of options and has built-in help for
  all the supplied functions and options. Pine is the best software 
  packages to use with smtp/nntp (like Elm and Grn). 
  Pine will be freeware and will need AmiTCP in order to work. Since this
  is a UNIX port, 2M is probably the minimum you will need for Pine to 
  work. Once released, Pine is downloadable from Aminet.

- An all new version 2.0 of Q-Blue, the popular offline mail reader for
  Amiga, by Paul Kienitz is now released to the Aminet.
  Q-Blue has long been the leading offline mail reader for Amiga computers,
  and version 2.0 represents a very substantial improvement over Q-Blue 1.0
  , the last official release. It handles both Blue Wave mail and QWK mail
  packets. It requires AmigaDOS 2.04 or newer. Q-Blue 1.0 is still
  available for those using older AmigaDOS versions.  But Q-Blue's strength
  has always been in how it handles the basics. Its user interface sets a
  standard for clarity and efficiency, it has gained a reputation for
  dependability and robustness even in early versions, and the thorough 136
  page user manual, noted as one of the best written of its kind, is now 
  clearer and better organized than ever. Some of the features that put
  Q-Blue 2.0 ahead of the competition include:

  - Full support for Fido netmail even with QWK packets
  - Configuration options that can be set differently for different BBSes
  - Remembers your place in a packet when you close and reopen it

  - Run multiple processes safely and with no inconvenience
  - Messages can be sorted according to thread links
  - Support for PCBoard 15.x long subject lines with QWK mail
  - Conversion of ANSI-cluttered messages into clear readable text
  - A powerful word search function that can be used in any scrolling
      list window as well as on the text or header info of messages
  - A "twit filter" with options for finely selective filtering
  - Quoting for replies that knows how to reformat paragraphs to a
    user-settable margin before adding ">" markers along the left edge (try
    it, and soon any offline reader without this feature will drive you
    crazy!)
  - More sophisticated text editor support than other offline readers, with
    sections in the manual on taking maximum advantage of the special 
    features of popular editors like CygnusEd and TurboText
  - Automatically keeps backups of old reply packets
  - You can write messages to upload without any downloaded mail packet
  - Full ability to move, re-edit, delete, and undelete your replies, reload
    unfinished reply packets, and flip instantly between a reply and the
    message it's responding to
  - QWK netmail support now handles the MKQWK door
  - The window that lists available mail packets tells you how much of each
    packet has already been read, and has a file delete option
  - A "Reply to addressee" command
  - A "stealth" mode that suppresses identifying brag lines at the ends of
    messages (for registered users only)
  - Several improvements to the tagline feature, including a sequential use
    option
  - Support for high resolution video modes
  - Word search can filter previous search results with new criteria
  - Search "hits" in message text are visually highlighted
  - Tagline and signature-block support built in
  - Customizable headers on quoted messages ("John said to Mary...")
  - "Carbon copy" function with its own customizable header
  - It can now display messages 8000 lines long
  - Workbench AppIcon and commodities-style popkey
  - Single-key command to append messages to a preselected text file
  - The twit list can now restrict exclusions to specified message areas
  - Load configuration files even while a mail packet is open

    the BBS it came from

- Ralph Schmidt annouces the release of CyberGuard mainly for the 
  Cyberstorm 060. Cyberguard has the same functionality as Enforcer
  V37 (by M.Sinz) with the enhancements of a build in a disassembler
  and a GuardianAngel mode. GuardianAngel mode means that it can 
  writeprotect free memory pages to detect random write bugs that are
  rather difficult to find.
  So programmers won't miss their most used debug tool, Enforcer, when they
  develop 68060 applications. CyberGuard is uploaded to AmiNet.

  ProVector version 3.0 features among others:
  - OS 2.04+ only but will take advantage of WB2.1 and WB3 features
  - AGA support
  - Good looking, easy to use, and much improved 3D user-interface with
    2.04+ look and feel

  - Improved tool control
  - Gradient fills
  - Object shearing & warping
  - Object blending (morphing from one object to another)
  - Improved text support
  - LightWave file exporting
  - Export Adobe Illustrator (all versions)
  - StylusTrace, a dedicated high quality auto-tracing program (converts
    bitmapped images into structured drawings) much better (faster, more
    accurate, more features) than the autotracing used by other programs
    on Mac/Amiga/IBM/Unix.
  - Extensive online help system using standard AmigaGuide
  - Support for all knwon Amiga graphic boards/accelerators
  - Stylus has worked close with SOFT-LOGIK to make the all new ProVector
    a good completation for PageStream 3.0, the king of DTP programs.

  for newcommers to vector based drawing softwares and ProVector, version
  2.1 of this excellent program features:

  - ProVector has a very complete and exellent Arexx interface and is fully
    programmable and extendable through Arexx As complete as you could want.
    You can do anything via ARexx that you can via the interface, and more.
    You can manipulate ProVector's internal data structures fairly directly
    , create your own custom object types (a physicist customer has created
    Feynman diagram objects, for example), create your own custom object 
    operations, etc. This in one of the most configurable Amiga software,
    since it has a very full featured ARexx implementation for user 
    customization and communication with other programs. The package 
    includes many useful ready-made ARexx macros.
  - ProVector comes with 2 HP-GL driver which can be and has been used to
    drive various sign cutting engines (vinyl cutting) like most Roland
    plotter. The IFF-DR2D format is directly supported by many curring 
    devices like Sign Engine. In addition to the tiling HP-GL driver, 
    another feature of ProVector that sign-cutters have found very useful
    is the floating point math version of ProVector. Tiling of large pages
    to multiple output pages allows you to make VERY large signs, page
    sizes, like 15 miles x 15 miles :-)
  - The input/output formats are Encapsulated PostScript (true PostScript
    editing), EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) created on all the personal and
    workstation computer platforms, IFF-ILBM (including 24-bit, ANTI-
    ALIASED ILBM), HP-GL, Illustrator/EPSF, Multiple Layers support for
    IFF-DR2D (Amiga standard format for structured drawing developed openly
    and in cooperation with the Amiga community by Stylus). It can also 
    print to any Preferences-supported printer.
    The postscript handling in ProVector is remarkable. It can save PS or
    EPS to PAR: SER: or a file.
    ProVector can be used for drawings to include in LaTeX documents and it
    works great. Specially because it provides the drawing with a correct
    BoundingBox (one that adjusts to the drawing) so dvips can position the
    figure correctly.
    That kind of data import capability is really useful when integrating
    the Amiga into today's work environment, an environment filled with a
    variety of computers running a wide spectrum of software.
  - Very fast freehand drawing tool
  - Very flexible spline tool
  - Other tools for boxes, ovals, polygonal shapes, fill control, line 
    control, text, etc.
  - Multiple projects open on-screen at one time. Multiple drawings are 
    open in separate windows and cut and paste between them is supported
  - Cut-and-paste to the Amiga clipboard
  - 255-level Undo
  - One of the fastest Amiga program, optimized for speed even on slower 
    Amigas. It uses less memory than any other vectorbased graphic package.
  - Text effects
  - Three version of the program for integer, floating point and 68020
    and up processors)
  - ProVector uses amiga multitasking enviroment very effectively. For
    example, when redrawing a screen you can go ahead and select your next
    operation and the redrawing will be aborted.
  - It supports 8 bit (256 color) per drawing out of 16 million colors via
    dithering. You can create custom fill patterns from any object.
  - It can rotate objets, text and also will "flow" text around any 
    outline. You can rotate about any point you desire, as well as rotate
    with clone, rotate by fixed increment, etc.
  - It has Splines curves Bezier cubic splines. It also can interpolate
    curves from a polygon.  It also supports elliptical arcs.
  - ProVector comes with a utility to convert PostScript Type 1 fonts to
    ProVector format, so you have quite a variety of fonts to choose from.

  AmyNews sidenote:
  We work with ProVector as well as many other structured drawing programs
  for many different platforms and we wish to mention that ProVector,
  assumimg that you can use it's exellent Arexx interface, is the fastest
  and most powerful structured drawing programs on any platfrom. We would
  like to rate the softwares that we use as follows:

  - ProVector, Amiga
  - Aldus Freehand, Mac
  - Adobe Illustrator, PC
  - Corel Draw, PC
  - MicroGraphx Designer, PC
  - Art Expression, Amiga

  If you need something for your technical drawings, something that can
  deal with EPS clipart created on any platform, something that will let
  you create your own using sophisticated structured drawing tools,
  something that will work with your other programs like Pagestream and
  FinalWriter, and that is actively supported and developed for the Amiga,
  you ought to look at ProVector. 
  Stylus has been selling and supporting ProVector for years and is 
  actively supporting and improving this software, and provids an excellent
  solution to people who need to work with structured drawing for things
  like video graphics, desktop publishing, technical drawings, and sign
  making.

- The very long awaited SAS C Amiga Developement package version 6.55 is
  now finally released. This patch may be found in AmiNet. The new version
  features (summary):

  - SE will now optionally display a C file in multiple colors for the
    different token types. You can select the foreground, background,
    and style (bold, italic, underline or normal) for each of the
    following nine catagories: Plain Text, C Comments, C++ Comments,
    Double quoted strings, Single quoted strings, Numerical constants,
    Keywords, Identifiers, and Preprocessor Statements. There are two
    new menu items to control this in the Configuration Window.
    Colorize C Files -  when set will cause all new files opened that
    end in .c* or .h to be colorized. Changing this will not effect
    any windows currently open in SE.
    Colorize C Prefs - will bring up another window and allow you to
    change the display attributes for any of the nine catagories.
  - A new profiler has been added that works like the SPROF profiler, but
    provides a graphical user interface to the profiling process.
  - Example code is provided in SC:EXAMPLES/AMIPROC that forks a
    subprocess with its own near data section.  This will allow you to
    share code between processes but still use external data in each
    subprocess.
  - Example code is provided in SC:EXAMPLES/MOUNT that mounts and
    dismounts a file system node on the system list WITHOUT using the
    AmigaDOS Mount command.  This will allow you to code a file system
    as a regular C program, invokable from command line or workbench.
    Since it's a regular process, it will be able to use printf() or
    other library I/O and be easily debuggable with CPR in any usual
    fashion.
  - Three new messages have been added to the C compiler: 188, 189,
    and 113.
  - Built-in preprocessor symbols (like _SHORTINT, _UNSCHAR, etc.)
    were not added to the GST in previous versions.  In 6.55, they
    are added.
  - The built-in memcpy function can copy certain structures more
    efficiently now since the compiler retains more information on
    the alignment requirements of the structures.  This also
    benefits structure assignment and call-by-value.
  - The layout of bitfields was inadvertently changed between 6.0 and
    6.50, which meant that structures containing bitfields were
    incompatible between the two versions.  Bitfields now use
    the 6.0 method, with the exception of bitfields of size :0.
    :0 bitfields exhibited a bug in 6.0-6.3 and added extra unusable
    bytes to the structure.  6.55 bitfields do not add these extra
    bytes.  Note that the bitfields in 6.51 and 6.55 are identical;
    this change only affects users upgrading from 6.50.
  - The compiler now defines a preprocessor symbol __AMIGADATE__.
    This preprocessor symbol resolves to a datestamp string in the
    format required for the AmigaDOS VERSION command.  The format is
    "(dd.mm.yy)", where dd is the day (1-31), mm is the month (1-12),
    and yy is the year. __AMIGADATE__ is available from both C
    and C++.  Version 6.51 had some bugs in the __AMIGADATE__
    processing which have been fixed for this patch release.
  - The macros for some functions defined in the C header files are
    now not defined if compiling C++.  They conflicted with the names
    of some member items of C++ classes in <iostream.h> or
    <complex.h>. Problem functions are <string.h>/index(),
    <math.h>/min(), max(), <fcntl.h>/open(), read(), write(),
    close(), <stdlib.h>/abs().  Many of these have alternate names
    using preceding underscores that can be used instead.
  - The priority of the autoinit functions for utility.library and
    the various Commodore math libraries were changed from 250
    to 100 in versions 6.51 and 6.55.  This allows the autoinitializer
    for the SPROF and GUIPROF profilers to use utility.library if it
    is compiled with UTILLIB.
  - And more new features + all known buggs are now fixed.

- A new version 1.5 of the awesome all new swedish text editor FrexxEd is
  released. Version 1.5 features:
  - Danish users are now able to register in Denmark using danish currency
  - Rexx/ShowFPL.rx by Edd Dumbill is an *EXCELLENT* tool for all of you
    out there, who are not quite certain of which FPL programs to execute
    and which you shouldn't execute at startup. Try it!
  - Visible is appended to the top of the default file to make executions
    of it look much better after FrexxEd is started.
  - MenuSelect is a new exception that occurs when a menu item is 
    selected.
  - New functions: "GetFileList()" , "MenuRead()" and "MenuDelete()"
  - The execute file requester now remembers the directory.
  - Functions.guide now has the node-names without the 'node_' prefix
  - GetByte(column, line) returns the byte position of the given parameters
    or the current position. Like GetCursor() but the other way around!
  - MenuAdd() now accepts optional coordinates where to add the menu item!
  - New 3D style sliders while on screen.
  - WindowToFront() with parameter -1 makes a WindowToBack
  - ExecuteFile() now accepts a file pattern to be executed
  - The 'copywb' setting is removed, the function CloneWB() is to be used
    to copy the public screen information to the FrexxEd settings.
  - An 'R' in the status-line shows if the buffer is read-only
  - The screen will beep if you try to edit a read-only buffer
  - FlipComment.FPL is made to "Flip comments around C-lines"
  - Addition of the so far pretty simple FPL debugger 'FPLdb' to the 
    FrexxEd:bin/directory as well as an FPLdb.doc file. That file improves
    FPL debugging capabilities.
  - FrexxEd now allows buffer executions to export/cache FPL programs. That
    means you can write your FPL program in a buffer when debugging it. Re-
    executing the same buffer will make FrexxEd first flush the old program
    and then run the buffer again.
  - WordWrap.FPL is updated. It doesn't leave any trailing spaces at the
    end of lines any more. Requested by Svante Hedin.
  - Update the docs. New chapters about macros appeared and updated the
    regular expression chapter
  - New version 1.1 of the fpl.library
  - New set of FPL programs:
    - DeleteSpaceEOL.FPL:
      An entirely new beast. This scans and removes white spaces at the
      end of lines before saving them if the toggle buttons says so.
    - RememberView.FPL:
      Make FrexxEd remember the view positions when "amiga 1" is pressed.
      "amiga 2" restores the views back as they were!
    - ISpell.FPL:
      ISpell interface
    - CheckLinks.FPL:
      Amigaguide document link control
    - GotoLabel.FPL:
      Collects all assembler labels in a list and lets the user select one
      to jump to. A poor man's 'ETags'!!
  - LoadSaveProject.FPL is now updated.
  - Save As... now uses a "save-style requster".
  - SASC.FPL.README has more information.
  - ResizeView() now accepts a buffer ID parameter.
  - top_offset is a new setting (info variable). If contains the line of
    the window the current view starts at. The variable is writeable.
  - Activate() accepts a new parameter: buffer ID of the buffer that the
    new view should originate from.
  - ReplaceMatch() now accepts two new additional parameters: range and
    flags.
  - ETags.FPL and the etags archive was added. A major help tool to any
    programmer using FrexxEd.
  - Escape is now equivalent to 'q' in replace prompts. Request.
  - And all known bugs are fixed.
  The crippled SHAREWARE version may be doenloaded from AmiNet.

- Utilities Unlimited International, inventer of the Amiga Emplant
  technology is now shipping e586DX (IBM PC) Emulation Module. The e586DX

- Gary Huber, President of Questar Productions announces the availability
  of version 1.1 of the World Construction Set. The new version does, 
  among other improvment, feature "Contour", a new map drawing style in 
  the Map View Module. When selected it will give you a real contour map
  presentation. It works best at map scales larger than 2. The contour 
  inteval is set by the Exag field in the Map View Control window. It is
  the same interval as is used for the "Multi" gradient drawing style.
  The units are in meters. It is sometimes difficult to see the 
  Interactive elements (Camera, Focus, Haze, Sun) in Map View against one
  of the gray-scale topographic backgrounds. Contour style lets you see 
  some of the elevation information while clearly letting you see the 
  Interactive elements. This can be a big help when laying out key frames
  for an animation. For uppgrade information and ordering please contact:

  programs Pro-Net and Pro-Board. The new versions are reported to be much
  faster. More information about these new releases in a later issue of
  AmyNews.

- The very long awaited telser.device is now released. telser is a modem
  simulator over a TCP telnet/rlogin connection. It simulates basic modem
  commands, so you can use telecommunication programs over a network
  connection. To your comm  program, it thinks it's talking to a modem. 
  Terminal emulation, file  transfers, scripting, etc.  are all handled by
  your comm  program. Connecting to a host is as simple as typing "ATDT
  abc.edu,23" or even simpler if you add the host to your comm's phonebook.
  telser supports most of the telnet/rlogin negotiation commands and
  options.  For example, you may elect to notify the remote host on
  changes to your terminal emulation type, and window size.  An intuitive
  "gadtools" graphical user interface is supplied to control your
  connections. You also have the option to automatically connect to a host
  after starting up your comm program. Instant logins at the click of a
  button!
  telser can also run in host mode, which means it would accept incoming
  telnet/rlogin calls. Calls may be tracked by telser's caller ID feature.
  You can easily set up a "multi-line" BBS over the internet!
  telser is capable of unlimited device units, which means you can have
  unlimited incoming and outgoing connections. It supports both TCP/IP
  packages on the Amiga, namely AmiTCP (tested with 3.0b2 and 4.0/4.1)
  and AS225r2. A demo version of the package may be downloaded from AmiNet.

- Tensor Productions announces the availability of CyberScape version 2.5.
  CyberScape software is currently being used on commercial and research VR
  projects around the world. It is a cost-effective and non-intrusive 
  alternative to the more expensive and cumbersome goggle/glove VR systems.
  CyberScape uses the "projected reality" metaphor by which the person or
  subject is immersed in the virtual world through real-time video input -
  the same metaphor used in VIDEOPLACE and VIDEODESK systems by Myron 
  Krueger and Mandala (R) systems by the Vivid Group.
  CyberScape is a script-based, event-driven, multi-threaded authoring
  software that takes advantage of a physically based 2D animation system.
  For example, a complete two-team volley ball experience can be 
  constructed with only about 100 lines of code. CyberScape can be used for
  many types of applications like Interactive Music and Video Performances,
  Kinetic Scuptures and Cybernetic Arts, Interactive Learning and Training,
  Virtual Reality Constructions, Hypermedia Presentations, Interactive
  Video Games etc. CyberScape version 2.5 features:
  - Inputs:
    2 video inputs (NTSC or PAL), PowerGlove in hi-res mode, 2 mouse 
    inputs, 2 MIDI inputs, and 2 ARexx inputs.
  - Outputs:
    Serial device, Parallel device, MIDI output, ARexx output, and laser-
    disk player controls.
  - Collision Detections:
    Inter-object collisions, boundary collisions, multiple collision 
    classes.
  - Object Dynamics:
    Velocity, acceleration, damping force, gravitational force, spring
    force, constrained string force, etc.
  - Event Triggering:
    Object grab and release, scene transition, timed sequence, arithmetic
    and logic operations.
  - Graphics:
    640x400 (up to 20% overscan), 8-bit (256 colors) or HAM8 (256K colors),
    standard picture, brush, and animation files.
  - Audio:
    Standard sampled sound file, MIDI output, synthesized speech.
  - User Extensions:
    Linkable object library and interface source code included.
  New features since version 2.5:
  - Amiga AGA support
  - Real-time clock support
  - Laserdisk players support
 
  Priced at $495.00 US for AGA version and $245.00 US for non-AGA version,
  CyberScape is available directly from:

- LHA v3.0 (the release version is probably named v3.1) is under beta 
  testing. It features amoung other things, a very user configurable GUI
  and up to 30% better compression ratio. A little version 3.0, basically
  with the new engine but without the long waited GUI is to be released
  during Mar-95. The complete version will be avalable in 2 or 3Q95.
 
- AmiGadget Publishing Company announces the release of Panorma version 4.
  Panorama is a fractal landscape generating program that allow the user
  sculpt a landscape by applying a variety of fractal parameters to initial
  data that can be graphically edited by moving peaks and valleys around on
  the screen with the mouse.  The program also imports data, including DEM
  (Digital Elevation Map) data for real places around the planet (or others).
  Panorma supports unattended operation for the creation of animations of
  any length, generated and recorded automatically, including automatic 
  support for single-frame video recording.  So, you can conduct a fly-by,
  or a fly-through, or follow a river as it meanders through lush, green
  valleys. Panorama can be entirely controlled and operated with software
  through its ARexx port. An extensive ARexx command structure provides 
  control over everything Panorama does. The Arexx functionality also 
  permits support of the VideoToaster and image processing software.
  Animation of finished landscapes can be achieved through an internal
  scripting language which includes the magic command "Tween" for easy
  scripting. Any feature can be animated, especially the program's awesome
  skies, and its waves and waterfalls (AmyNews: Amazing feature). Panorama
  can simply record a script as you work the program.  You can then edit 
  the script if you wish, to add Tween and other powerful functions.
  New new version 4.0 contains many enhancements and additional features 
  over the previous versions.  Panorama supports 24-bit pictures of any
  resolution, up to more than 8,000 by 8,000 pixels.  The program will work
  directly to several of the available frame buffers - OpalVision, Retina,
  and Picasso - and Version 4.0 has much better support of AGA machines.
  In addition, you can create and save AGA-only picture formats from
  Panorama running on non-AGA Amigas. It has added fractal dithering and
  textures. These can be applied to anything in the program for which 
  texture or dithering is appropriate - including tree leaves, water, 
  clouds, etc. The program includes some features normally associated with
  raytracing, such as shimmering reflections of the sky in the waves.
  The program lists for $99.95 US.  It is available direct from AmiGadget
  Publishing Company for an introductory price of $69.95.
  Updates from any previous version of the program are $35 US (+ $4 
  shipping), which includes the entire package: 5 floppy disks and the 
  completely revised manual.  Updates from any version of Genesis, add an
  extra $5.

- Data Compression Technologies has just release an all new Amiga packer
  called LZX. LZX is a brand new data compression program developed on and
  for the Amiga, sporting mind-blowing compression rates, and brain-
  staggering speed. LZX uses compression technology that is absolutely 
  state of the art, and offers a compression/performance ratio superior to
  that of all other programs for the Amiga, as well as to all programs for
  ms-dos. Aming tons of features LZX sports File merging, a feature which
  enables compression to be increased, often very significantly, by 
  allowing data from one file to be compressed using the knowledge of
  previous files in the archive.  This feature, unique to LZX on the Amiga
  , often improves compression by 300% or more!

- The UK company Almathera Systems Limited has just released an update
  version 1.1 to it's wonderful paint and image manipulation package
  Photogenics. The new version features:
  - Toolbar Changes
    - Smear
      Smear is a new powerful effect. When selected, the standard drawing
      options will smear the picture rather than applying a paint effect.
      Unlike other paint effects (eg. Negative) Smear does not use the
      standard system of operation where you can rub-out your work with the
      right mouse button. Both buttons do the same during smear. If you 
      have undo enabled you can use the Undo option from the menu to undo
      the LAST APPLIED smear operation. As smear affects the 24-bit data
      directly make sure you have a back-up of your image (either by 
      cloning the buffer or by saving to disk) before you start using
      Smear! Smear uses the current brush, so different effects can be
      used with other brush types like Chalk Pastel.
    - Colour Picker.
      Previosly this had no image.
  - Blur Paint Layer
    A new option has been added to the Alpha/Paint Layer menu called 'Blur
    Paint Layer'. This option will 'blur' the edges of the selected paint
    (without needing to fix it). If you draw a solid shape like a filled
    circle it normally has sharp, unnatural edges. By choosing this option
    the edges of this (and any other unfixed paint) are blurred so they 
    will blend into the background.
  - PCD.gio
    You can now load Photo .PCD files directly into Photogenics. Only the
    lowest three resolutions in .PCD (192x128, 384x256, and 768x512)
    are currently supported. This .GIO file loads and can automatically
    detect .PCD files
  - Close Workbench
    A new option to the settings menu, allows you to close workbench. 
    Select 'Close Workbench' if you are running short of memory.
  - Tolerance Fill
    This has been renamed 'Fill Similar'.
  - Colours Window
    If you press the 'Colours' button in the palette requester, you can
    now access the Colours window.  This lets you create spreads of
    colour, and also lets you see what palettes were saved with any images
    you may have loaded.
  - Greyscale
    The greyscale paintmode now has more options. Previously it had two
    different methods of calculating a greyscale picture. Now it has no
    less than eleven: Video Weighted, Simple Average, Brightest, Darkest,
    Median, Red Filter, Green Filter, Blue Filter, Cyan Filter, Magenta
    Filter, Yellow Filter
  - Brushes
    Four new brush types have been added to the program:
    - BallPen: Simulates a ballpoint ink pen. Like real pens the colours
               mix differently to normal paint.
    - Calligraphy: A simple angled nib calligraphy marker.
    - MarkerPen: Simulates a thick marker pen. Colour mixing works in a
               similar way to BallPen.
    - SprayCan: Spray can works like the airbrush but has a higher 
                pressure and defaults to continuous mode. Useful for
                highlighting areas for image processing.
  - Clock and Memory Display
  - Opalvision
    There are now two Opalvision displayers included Opal_Low and Opal_
    High. These replace the single displayer previously found in the
    program.

- We just recieved a fax from Advanced Systems & Software, AS&S, Germany,
  the maker of CyberVision and CyberStorm 68060 for the Amiga. The Amiga 
  4000 version of the CyberStorm is shipping now! The release date for 
  Amiga 3000 (YES, IT'S TRUE) is mid Feb 95! Also SOON! This baby sports a
  massive 85 Mips even in it's 50 MHZ (currently shipping). The CPU is 
  simply upgradable to the 80 Mhz version. The 80 Mhz 68060 will does apr.
  130 Mips! To get an idea how FASSTTTTT this babies are consider that an
  Amiga 3000/ 25 MHZ 68030 does apr. 7-8 MIPS. A4000/25 MHZ 68040 does apr
  18-19 MIPS. CyberVision 64, the fastest Amiga graphic board sporting S3
  technology is also shipping now for all ZORRO-III Amiga. 
  Phase 5 digital products development team (developer of Cyber products)
  , Official Motorola Beta Site Developer, is a leading technological 
  developer in the AMIGA sector. This has already been demonstrated with
  products such as the Fastlane Z3 or the Blizzard Series.
  Here is complete release information for these 2 Cyber products:
  - CyberStorm Amiga accelerator system sporting 68060 CPUs from Motorala
    This util consists of several modules but each CyberStorm system 
    contains a Carrier Board, a CPU Module and a Memory Board. The CPU 
    module can be exchanged for another version at any time without having
    to change any of the other components.  This concept guarantees optimal
    access speed and the greatest possible performance at each CPU speed.
    The CyberStorm System is not linked to any particular type of CPU.
    Processor modules with other than 680x0 processors can be installed at
    any time, as long as they are supported by the Amiga operating system.
    Wherever the future of the Amiga may lead, you can be assured that the
    CyberStorm will keep apace of technological advances.
    - CyberStorm Carrier Interface Board
      Inserts into the 200 pin Amiga Fast-Slot and contains ports for the
      CPU Module, Memory Board and the I/O Module. Fully asynchronous 
      interface between the modules. Extremely fast programmable logic,
      selected A-Grade FCT circuit logic, high-class high density connector
      Slot for 68060 software Boot ROM (or Flash ROM) or Ethernet Boot ROM
      (used with the CyberStorm I/O Module) to boot up the computer from a
      network hard drive.
    - CyberStorm CPU Module:
      Optimally tuned to the processor used and its speed Prepared for CPU
      clock speeds up to 80 MHz. Active CPU cooling, uncoupled CPU voltage
      supply with 5 or 3.3 Volt Voltage control at 3.3 V for 68060 version.
      Bi-directional high speed buffering with expensive A-Grade FCT 
      switching logic 120 pin high density port for Second Level Cache 
      Module or other expansions.
    - CyberStorm Memory module
      Slots for 4 SIMM modules in 32 bit technology standard 72 pin modules,
      Sizes: 4, 8, 16 and 32 MByte per module, freely mixable, maximum
      configuration 128 MByte. Fully DMA capable memory, also supports 
      Zorro3 DMA access. Fast 2-1-1-1 Burst Mode access when reading and
      3-1-1-1 when writing at 25 MHz RAM speed with 60 or 70 ns RAM) 
      achieving data transmission greater than 50 MByte/sec measured or
      effective value) Independent of CPU clock speed.
      The asynchronous interface concept also applies to the memory: the
      bi-directional buffer logic allows the CyberStorm CPU asynchronous 
      access to the memory which operates at the AMIGA system speed of 
      25MHz. This principle makes the memory transparent to other system
      components which access it by DMA, and avoids possible problems that
      can arise with so-called local memory designs which, for example, are
      directly linked with a CPU clock.  There is no principle speed 
      disadvantage over designs which operate the memory at higher clock
      speeds, as 25MHz is the upper limit for memory access without wait
      cycles (even for 60ns fast D-RAMs), which is performed on the 
      CyberStorm in Burst Mode Access. With a data throughput that is 
      nearly independent of the processor frequency of up to 66.66 MB/s in
      Burst Mode Access even a CyberStorm System clocked at 25 MHz 
      demonstrates clear acceleration, especially when working with large
      amounts of data.
    - CyberStorm I/O Module (Optional)
      Fast SCSI-II interface with internal and external 50 pin SCSI 
      connector. Data transmission in the full address area using its own
      32 bit DMA channel, FIFO buffered, bandwidth >30 MB/s. Asynchronous
      to 7 MB/s, synchronous to 10 MB/s data transmission on the SCSI bus
      with minimal CPU loading. The know-how gained from developing the 
      Fastlane Z3 (the world's first 32 bit SCSI Controller for the Amiga)
      was used extensively in the design of the SCSI interface, which has
      mature driver and utility software amongst other features. Extensive
      software including CD-ROM Filesystem, dynamic caching software and 
      various SCSI Tools.
      10 MBit/s Ethernet controller. SANA driver for transparent linking to
      various network systems. High speed due to its FIFO buffered, 32 Bit
      DMA channel Coaxial (BNC) and Dsub15 ethernet connector (Thin Ethernet
      /Standard Ethernet). 
      Serial high-speed interface RS232 with 115kbaud, with its own FIFO 
      buffer has also been integrated in the I/O Module to guarantee 
      problem-free operation of fast serial devices without data loss.
    - CyberStorm Cache Module (Optional)
      No further information currently available.
    The CyberStorm CPU Module also offers another High Speed Connector with
    direct processor connection through which, for example, cache memory 
    and boards with second processors (e.g.  DSPs) or other high speed 
    expansions can be connected. All CyberStorm components are manufactured
    in Germany to the highest industrial quality in modern Fine Pitch SMD
    technology and are subjected to complete functionality test prior to
    delivery. A3000 and A4000T versions have limited modularity and 
    expansion capabilities.
  - CyberVision 64, ultrafast 64-bit graphic acceleration system for Amiga:
    The CyberVision 64 satisfies the most demanding requirements on 
    performance and system conformity because of its combination of an
    extremely fast 32 bit Zorro-3 interface, a 64 bit wide graphics 
    controller and exceptional software. Based on the highly integrated
    graphic chip Trio64 from the renowned manufacturers S3, which 
    integrates an expensive graphics processor, a complex 64 bit wide
    Blitter as well as a highly efficient 24 bit converter for D/A 
    conversion, the CyberVision 64 can offer a video band width of 135 MHz.
    It will, therefore, support a variety of resolutions in True Color, 
    High Color and 256 colours. The CyberVision 64 32 Bit Zorro3 interface
    is highly optimised and allows transmission rates from the AMIGA main
    memory to the graphic memory of up to 16 MByte/sec - an exemplary rate
    that sets new standards. Data transfers within the CyberVision 64 
    video memory are executed by the 64 Bit Blitter at speeds above 100
    MByte/sec, practically in an imperceptible amount of time, resulting
    in extremely fast shifting operations, for example. Another special
    feature of the CyberVision 64 is its hardware support of Planar-to-
    Chunky Conversion which, with Amiga graphics cards, often takes up most
    of the time required for emulation/representation of the Amigamodes.
    This hardware solution is some 6-8 times faster than typical software
    solutions which considerably accelerates the emulation and 
    representation of Amiga modes and especially the representation of 8
    Bit graphics. Complementing this efficient hardware is excellent driver
    software which fully utilises the performance of the card for unusual
    system conformities. The CyberVision 64 screen modes are installed via
    the CyberVision 64 monitor files, are available via normal ASL-
    Requester (e.g.  in screen mode in PREFS) as "normal" system 
    resolutions, and for common applications operating under OS3.0 or 3.1
    require no additional driver.
    The CyberVision 64 has an expansion bus through which additional cards
    such as JPEG or MPEG cards can directly access the fast video memory
    making the CyberVision 64 suitable for future developments. The
    combination of the attention that has been paid to necessary details,
    such as slipped through AMIGA video signal and integrated, loss-free 
    electronic switching, default-monitor-timing on system start-up or 
    simple expansion of the 2MB version to 4MB with common memory modules,
    with the usual high quality of phase 5 products will be able to satisfy
    even the most demanding user.
    Resolution Noninterlaced: up to 1280x1024 pixels in 8 bit, up to 
    800x600 pixels in 24 bit; Interlaced: up to 1600x1200 pixels in 8 bit,
    up to 1024x768 pixels in 24 bit. 135 MHz Video DAC Planar-to-chunky pixel
    conversion using special hardware (RoXXIer chip). Slip through Amiga
    signal with loss-free, electronic switching Digital video bus for optimal
    expansion (shared memory bus) with access to the video memory. System 
    local software with Workbench emulation, Support Library, linking via
    monitor files CyberVision 64 screen modes including standard Amiga
    resolutions).

- Todd Vierling announces that a gamma version 0.9.1 of AmiNIX, a new 
  implementation of BSD UNIX is now released. It runs on any 680x0 series
  processor, and does not require either an MMU or FPU. It does not have
  the superstrict protection that NetBSD or Linux have, and is not
  designed for that; AmiNIX is designed for UNIX compatibility on few-to-
  one-user systems and for restricted remote use (via rksh and the like).
  AmiNIX is an ``extension'' that gives UNIX ability to AmigaOS. The
  release version 1.0 is under development.

- Daniel S. Milling Jr. announces the release of RenderCalc version 1.46,
  the ultimate multimedia tool for 3D artist that want to know the number
  of frames it would take for an object moving X miles per hour to move Y
  feet. RenderCalc features:
  - Ability to enter values for Speed and Distance and receive output
    telling the user how many total frames, seconds, minutes and the 
    length of time, in the specified time code format, that the motion
    will take.
  - The Speed, Distance and Length Input Gadgets have Cycle gadgets 
    attached to them which allows you to change the units of the entered
    number 'on the fly.' This gives you instantaneous updates without 
    having to re-type the number.
  - Table of conversions between units of length.  Supported units are
    inches, feet, yards, miles, millimeters, meters and kilometers.
  - Ability to change the units of ANY inputted number and have all of the
    values update, relative to the new units, on the fly.  This saves 
    having to re-type the values.
  - If you want to convert a number to different units, you may enter
    that number into the Length gadget and see the printed results in the
    conversion table below.
  - The table of conversions is linked to the Distance and Length gadgets,
    which means that any number entered in either gadget will be converted
    and printed into the table.  The reason for this is that if you enter
    a number into the Distance gadget and would like to know what it 
    converts to in units of a different system, you don't have to re-type
    it into the Length gadget.  It is automatically calculated and printed
    for you.
  - SMPTE non-drop frame, EBU and Film time code supported.  SMPTE drop
    frame is NOT implemented at this time.
  - Ability to enter Time Code In and Out points as well as a Duration.
    The time code values are printed out under the Time Code Output 
    section. The time code input has two modes of operation.  You may
    enter Time Code In and Time Code Out points which results in Duration
    being the final output value. You may also enter a Time Code In and a
    Duration which will give you the Time Code Out as your final value.
  - Ability to add/subtract either timecode values or a number of frames
    from any of the Timecode Input values.  This saves a lot of time and 
    comes in quite handy when you need to alter an already inputed value.
  - Ability to enter a decimal frame value and have it converted to the
    appropriate time code, relative to the current Time Code Type.
  - Ability to change the Time Code Type 'on the fly.'  This means that 
    you may switch between the supported time code formats and see the 
    updated results immediately without having to re-enter the values.
  - And more.
  A full demo version of the program is available on AMINET.

- Bruce Dawson from Cygnus Software (he wrote the wonderful CygnusEditor,
  CEd) announces the release of a new version 2.01 of the best fractal 
  exploration program for the Amiga, Mand2000. Mand2000 draws pictures of
  the Mandelbrot set and other fractals on your Amiga and allows you to
  explore them by doing animated zooms towards interesting areas. Mand2000
  combines speed, power and simplicity with a few unique features, all 
  designed to make it easy for you to discover uncharted regions of the
  Mandelbrot set, Julia set and other fractals. Feature list:
  - Point and click animated zooming, the most intuitive way of exploring
    the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. Just point and double click.
  - Mand2000 allows you to pan across fractal images using your keyboard,
    mouse, or joystick.  Plug in your joystick to scroll and zoom your way
    around the most complex object ever seen.
  - Mand2000's multi-pass drawing lets you see an approximation of the 
    final picture in a fraction of the total calc time.  Even for pictures
    that will take several minutes to complete, you can get a good idea of
    what your picture will look like almost immediately.  This allows you
    to quickly decide whether to keep zooming, or wait for the completed
    picture.
  - Mand2000 has a multi-window, multi-requester design.  You can adjust
    parameters and see the changes in real time as Mand2000 continues
    calculating while you use the requesters.  Leave as many requesters 
    and fractal windows open as you want.
  - Mand2000 lets you calculate fractal zoom movies quickly, by 
    calculating key frames and letting Mand2000's TweenPlayer create the
    intermediate frames at playback.
  - Mand2000 has full AGA support, compatibility with the all third party
    graphics boards in up to 256 colour mode, literally dozens of 
    different assembly language math routines for accuracies ranging from
    16 bit to 1000+ bit, on-line help, printing, multi-level undo, built
    in locations to start you searching, full featured ARexx support, 
    several ARexx scripts supplied, graphical displaying of your location,
    etc.
  - Mand2000 supports rendering fractals in HAM, HAM8, and dithered 256 
    colour.  This allows you to display your fractals in thousands of
    different colours - on ANY Amiga.  The entire user interface will now,
    optionally, run in these modes, allowing a separate palette for each
    fractal window, each palette consisting of thousands of colours.
  - Mand2000 creates anim files directly.  Iteration movies, Julia seed
    movies, morph movies, and whatever animation types you feel like
    adding. All of these are written out in the standard anim format, for
    immediate playback with any animation player.

- Utilities Unlimited International, inventer of the Amiga Emplant
  technology is announcing the new version 5.0 of the software for the
  Macintosh emulation module. Jim Drew of UU, showed "e586DX", the IBM-PC
  module for the Emplant at the Dec 94 Word of Amiga Show in London.
  The software emulates a Pentium chip (without the bug :-). The  CPUID
  instruction  returns  "Amiga  Inside"  as vendor information :-)
  The emulation requires a GFX board with a VGA controller, like the
  Picasso  or Piccolo. The emulation works  very stable. All x86 
  instructions are translated 1-to-1 on the fly, so the speed of the 
  emulation depends on the type of  operation. On the test machine at
  the show, memory moves were 2.5 times faster than on a 486DX2-66, but
  computational intensive instructions are slower.
  The PC emulator will be available in mid  January 95.  It will require

  software.
 
- Helmut Hoffmann announces the release of EGSPhotoAlbum version 1.7, the
  comfortable picture management and presentation software for EGS 
  equipped Amigas. Here is a list of improvements in version 1.7:
  - User interface
    There is now a page menu in the preview page window, which allows to
    flip the pages without use of the control window. The menu entries
    also have keyboard shortcuts.
  - Remove function
    The delete function of V1.5 has been extended by a remove function,
    which does not actually delete files on disk but just removes pictures
    from the preview page
  - Separate directory for preview files selectable
    You can now select a separate preview file directory. This allows 
    usage of the fast preview files also with readonly media as CD-ROMs
  - Different preview file formats which can save disk space
    You can now select different preview file formats to optimize speed
    or disk usage (former versions only used the fast but uncompressed
    P6 format; now IFF or JPeg can also be used for preview files).
  Helmut Hoffmann's wonderful EGS-TV is now available in a new verison 
  3.6b. EGS-TV now officially support the ImpactVision IV24 framegrabber.
  The ImpactVision IV24 users can use EGS-TV for:
  - A fascinating Blue Screen Keying effect
  - Record sequences of video directly to harddisk
  - Comfortably grab an unlimited number of single pictures, view them in
    separate windows in 24Bit quality in high speed, save them in many 
    formats (e.g. JPeg, IFF24, ...) or transfer them to other programs

  The driver implements horizontal and verical whitespace stripping, as
  well as Epson compression mode 2 ("TIFF v4.0 packbits mode") to minimize
  the amount of data that must be sent to the printer and improve printing
  speed. A beta tester reported speed on an Amiga 3000 comperable to that 
  of a 66MHz 486 with Epson's MS-Windows driver.
  The driver implements a very simple color correction for 720dpi modes to
  prevent them from printing excessively dark.  This gives results similar
  to other drivers on the same printer (for example, the PageStream 2.x 
  LQ2550C driver). "Endicor Technologies, Inc." is investigating a future
  update with improved color correction, which will provide more accurate
  colors and better gradation.

- The US company Softwood is working on a new spreadsheet program for the
  Amiga. It will blow away anything out for the Amiga to date. Supposedly
  it will be on the scale of Excel. FinalCalc (FC) is a high-end spread-
  sheet that aims at providing the Amiga with something to compete with
  the top spreadsheets in the 'outside world'.
  Its main formula recalc engine has been written to be significantly more
  powerful than the current generation of spreadsheets.  The engine always
  does a 'natural' recalc.  i.e. formulas are evaluated in the order of 
  their inter-dependancies, no matter how complex, making sure that the
  result of a formula is correct.
  The recalc engine always runs in the _background_.  The user never waits
  for FC to recalculate.  You keep on editing cells while FC chugs along 
  in the background, catching up and updating the display as you work. 
  This is very smooth and has to be used to be believed.  Even with this,
  the recalc code itself is very fast anyway, recalculating only what has
  changed or needs to be recalculated, not the entire project.
  FinalCalc's user interface is designed to be both easy to use, and
  power-user friendly.  Everything is keyboard/hotkey driven as well as
  mouse driven. Almost every function, requester, feature can be 
  controlled from the keyboard without using the mouse.  The user 
  interface can come up on any screen mode and use any Amiga font, even
  changing the screen mode and/or the user font on the fly.
  FinalCalc supports multiple sheets per 'Project'.  (a project can 
  consist of 1 to 254 sheets, each containing a maximum of ZZZ (18277)
  columns and 65000 rows.)
  FinalCalc has very powerful printing features, great 2D and 3D graphs,
  more than 630 arexx/script commands, and tons of features.
 
- The WARP System, a Transputer System for the Amiga, from the US company
  Cybernetic, is now released. The specs for the WARP are very impressive.
  WARP basically allows you to load off cpu intensive tasks to Transputer
  boards using the Warp OS. You can add as many boards as you want to 
  your system, increasing performance proportionally.  The base board does
  around 50 Mips and installs in a Zorro slot.  The other boards (Warp 
  Twin 70 Mips, Warp Tripple 105 Mips) are then connected to the base 
  board. System comparisons to an Amiga 4000/40 are quite impressive, a
  render that take around 1 hour on an A4000/40, take around 50 seconds
  on a 1000 Mips Warp system. A Warp System adapted (rendering engine) 
  for Adspec's Aladdin 4D is available, others including Real3D and 
  Lightwave are to follow. Cybernetic also announces Cybernetica's 
  "Reality Prime Engine Series" of software, a system of modules designed
  to work initially with Warp System, and later with other software on a
  standard Amiga. These releases, each with the engine tag, will add a 
  host of options for 3D animators. The lineup is slated LighEngine (for
  ray-tracing and radiosity), Physics (for animation control), Paint (for
  image-processing, compositing and painting), Modeling, Animation, 
  Morphing, Particle, Sound, Video and more. The releases will be
  staggered.  The Light Engine and Cybernetica's Newton's Law (animation
  module for LightWave) have already been released.

- The new multimedia authoring software for the Amiga, InterPlay for the
  Amiga 2000/3000/4000, allows creation of MultiMedia CDs. InterPlay 
  features an intuitive point-and-click WYSIWYG interface and requires 4
  MB of memory to operate.
 
- The wait is over ;-) The UK based company Almathera is finaly due to
  the immediate release of it's long-awaited program, Photogenics. Being
  called "The Next Generation Image Processor", Photogenics is a hybrid
  of an image processor and paint package. Photogenics combines the
  features of a powerful image manipulation package with the ease-of-use
  and creative freedom of a traditional paint program.
  You can load a variety of different images (JPEG, GIF, IFF, etc.) 
  and save them in different formats, but Photogenics is much more than
  just a simple conversion system.  Artists will love the multiple built
  in natural brushes (chalk, pencil, pastel, etc...), or you may perfer
  to retouch pictures with the airbrush.  Through the variety of 
  operations and the powerful visual alpha channels, image manipulation
  has never been so enjoyable.
  You can edit multiple images - each in its own resizable window.  The
  realtime HAM-8 display gives you full-colour painting without needing a
  24-bit graphics board.
  Photogenics's interface allows you to work on several images at one time
  by opening a re-sizeable window for each one. Thanks to the program's
  open architecture, you will be able to add your own effects, loaders
  and savers.
  Designed for graphics artists and serious painters, Photogenics gives a
  professional working environment offering many features not even found
  on PC or Mac packages.  The open-architecture design gives programmers
  the freedom of writing their own loaders, savers or effects.
  Photogenics will be introduced at the World of Amiga show on Dec 94.
 
- SunRize Industries announces the release of it's SoundSwitch eight
  channel audio mixer. It puts the Video Toaster in complete control of

  into your floopy drive port, click on a Crouton, and voila... you've
  switched your audio with your video. It automaticaölly switches to the
  correct audio sources when you do a transition and performs cross-fades
  flawlessly. SoundSwitch sounds even better than your CD player with it's
  dynamic range of 95! decibels. SoundSwitch includes the Mixer, Meter
  and SMPTE modules from SunRize's studio 16. It's compatible with any
  edit controller for the Video Toaster, including NewTek's Video Toaster
  Flyer and RGB's AmiLink.
 
- An all new version of the wonderful DiskSalv 3.0 version 11.32 (4Q/94),
  the original Amiga disk recovery tool is now released. Developed by Dave
  Haynie and published by Intangible Assets Manufacturing, it is the 
  fourth major revision of DiskSalv, and it offers features never before
  found in DiskSalv or other Amiga disk utilities. DiskSalv 3.0 v11.32 
  features:
  - A Hot New Look
    The old user interface has been completely reworked. While the best
    features have been retained, much has been improved. The font 
    sensitivity is better than everThe overall look is cleaner, with
    graphical queues throughout that enhance operations without making
    undue demands on your system's memory or pretending to be a video 
    game. Gadgets and help texts are context sensitive.  Device selection
    throughout is drag-and-drop, though of course enhanced list selection
    is still available for the asking. Interactive AmigaGuide links are
    provided for every gadget and menu function.
  - An Ounce of Prevention
    A disk can now be checked for troubles without actually making any
    repairs, for extra confidence. Deleted directories, files, and data
    can be permanently erased for added security, program releases, etc.
    Traditional full or incremental backups are supported, in the same 
    style as DiskSalv's recovery functions.
  - And a Pound of Cure
    You still get traditional DiskSalv functions, only better.  Undeletes
    can often be performed in-place.  A fully redesigned filter mechanism
    supports pattern matching on full pathnames, file notes, dates, file
    sizes, and/or protection bits.  Pattern matches can be used to include
    a file in a scan, exclude it, or stop a scan on a match.  Any number
    of filter groups may be active at the same time, and such groups may
    be loaded from disk.
  - When Time Counts
    A new intelligent prefetching disk cache, buffered file I/O, and 
    improved internal design makes DiskSalv faster than ever. The scroll
    bar calculations have been refined for greater accuracy.
  - There's Nothing to Lose
    Device description editing and volume searching functions have been
    greatly enhanced.  DiskSalv can freely convert between its internal
    device format, standard Amiga ASCII format (DOSDrivers files), and
    Rigid Disk Blocks (the standard autoboot format).
  - Going by the Book
    A complete, on-line AmigaGuide manual is included to aid both beginner
    and advanced user. Details range from the basics through a complete
    theory of operation. Decriptions of all DiskSalv file formats and
    associated C Language "include" files are also supplied.

- SoftWood new Database program for the Amgia, "Final Data" version 1.0
  is now released. Final Data is an easy-to-use, flat file data manager.
  Final Data's purpose is to provide a simple, yet powerful way for people
  to orgainize and print lists of information on their Amiga. It is ideal
  for tasks such as:
  - name and adress lists (friends, customers, business contacts, etc.)
  - collections of any type (video, CD, stamp, coin, etc.)
  - reference material such as titles of books and periodicals
  - home inventory, bills, birthday reminders, and appointments
  A Final Data database appears on the screen as a table with rows and
  columns similar to the way a spreadsheet looks.  Viewing a database in
  this manner lets you look at a lot of information at the same time. 
  Columns may be narrowed or widened by dragging a column's border with
  the mouse.
  Data is entered into cells in a similar manner as entering data into a
  word processor or text editor. As you go from cell to cell entering data
  the program verifies that the information you enter is consistent with
  the type of information expected.
  Final Data can arrange data in any desired sequence. A unique feature
  gives you the option of sorting either an entire database or only 
  selected rows.  The search and replace feature lets you make changes in
  the same manner as in a word processor.
  You can print a database in either label or columnar report format.
  Final Data prints reports complete with page headings that included 
  title and page number. Reports may also be printed with totals and row
  counts.
  Labels can be defined in a variety of user-defined formats. Labels can
  be printed from one to many across a page.  Final Data uses a printer's
  built-in fonts for maximum speed and readability.
  Final Data was programmed fromthe beginning with ARexx in mind. There
  are over 75 Final Data ARexx commands that you can use to develop 
  scripts. There is also a user-defined ARexx menu you can use to access 
  your scripts.

- The Netherland based company Lyppens Software Productions announces the
  release of Video Backup System, VBS, version 3.0. Major features of the
  new version include:
  - User interface
    The  VBS  3.0  software  is compatible  with  all  Amigas  and
    requires AmigaOS 2.x/3.x or higher. VBS is now even easier  to
    use  and has a completely redone 2.0-look user interface.  You
    can  customize it by means of font and screen mode-requesters.
    VBS can also run on the Workbench-screen.
  - Speed
    There  are new backup modes for Amigas with an 68020 or higher
    CPU  (A1200, A2500, A3000, A4000). The first one gives a speed
    improvement  of  a  factor 2 compared to  V1.5,  without  data
    compression. The typical thoughput in this case  is  85MB  per
    hour,  for a total of 340MB per 4-hour  video tape! The  other
    new  mode adds data compression to this, and is up to 3  times
    as fast as V1.5 (depending on the compression ratio achieved).
    With 130MB per hour, 520MB will fit on a 4-hour tape.
    VBS 3.0 can read and write V1.5 backups without problems.
  - Partial Restore
    In  3.0, it is no longer necessary to replay the entire backup
    when  only a few files are to be restored. After VBS has  read
    the  directory tree structure from the VCR, the  tape  can  be
    fast  forwarded  if  the desired file is  far  away  from  the
    beginning.   During Restore and Verify, VBS  displays  on  the
    screen which file and directory it is currently working on.
  - Counter type
    VBS  now supports VCRs having a numeric instead of a real-time
    counter.
  - Settings
    VBS now has a requester for the following settings:
    - Counter type (Numeric/Time).                 
    - Video Connection Check (on/off).             
    - Use Public screen (on/off).                  
    - Beep after backup (on/off).                  
    - Log file/Report directory.                   
    - Fonts for user interface and Visual Header.  
    - Screen mode.                                 
  - Batch Backup
    The  Video Backup System now lets you define a list of backups
    to  be  made. Previously, it was necessary to manually make  a
    separate  backup for each hard disk partition. With  VBS  3.0,
    you simply enter the desired partitions in the batch list. VBS
    will  then successively make separate backups for each one  of
    these  partitions. The batch backup can be programmed to start
    either at a specific time-of-day or directly.
    If  desired,  the software can give an audio signal  when  the
    backup(s) are ready.
  - Installer
    Installation of VBS 3.0 on your hard drive is done  using  the
    Commodore Installer: user friendly and trouble-free.

     because you cannot RunCommand() "execute".
  - Not only "*" and "?" but also "[" and "]" recognized as AmigaDOS
     pattern. (that means, to use "[" and "]" you must quote (") or
     escape (\) them!)
  - ... and much more workarounds for serious bugs in DateToStr() and
     Locale.
  - Fixed bug: making an assign to an executable and calling the
     executable by its assign crashed machine.
  - Fixed bug: builtin command "cp" sometimes used already freed memory
     for generating error messages (resulted in some strange error
     messages).
  - New flag for for command abbreviation ($_abbrev):
     8, search DOS path-list if command wasn't found in Cshell's
     internal program hash list (see "rehash" command)
  - CTRL-D now shows matching files if current word is not a directory.
     (if directory then shows contents of directory -- as usual)
     In its current implementation this may have unexpected side effects
     if current word is already a pattern.
  - Class definition for AmigaE in class.sh
  - Now internal timer (eg, %e in the titlebar) not set to zero when a
     null command is encountered. (same for return code, %x in titlebar)
  - The idea of always using the variable "_dirformat" for "dir" wasn't
     a good idea.  So, "_dirformat" is only used if option -z is given
     (when "_dirformat" is unset then use first argument as format
     string).
  - New control-code for line-editing: "^V" (ctrl-v) quotes next char.
  - New builtin variable "_kick" holds version number of Operating
     System.
  - Builtin command "assign" now prints volume name if assign points to
     an unmounted volume (eg, a removed floppy disk) and doesn't pop up
     a requester "Please replace volume ..."
  - It was a stupid idea to force redirecting of all Cshell-related
     system requesters to CSH's screen, because requester windows
     inherit the window title of their "initiator". They appear now
     again on your default public screen.
  - Fixed serious bug (crashed machine) with redirection and launching
     programs into background. (files closed twice)
     Known bug: it's still not possible to run pipes into background...
  - When running programs into background (run, rback, &), internal
     commands and aliases are recognized and executed with "csh -c".
     Aliases WON'T be resolved on this level so they must be declared
     in .cshrc to run them into background.
  - Execution of Rexx-Scripts (without trailing ".rexx") and any other
     program with "#! my_prog" or ";! my_prog" in first line of script
     now possible also from DOS search path and not only $_path.
  - New builtin variable "_mappath" (see manual), enables pathname-
     mapping for commands if script starts with "#!" or ";!" in first
     line.  Converts Unix pathes like "/usr/..." to "usr:...".
  - New option "-w" for Cshell, don't use window pointer (useful for
     KingCON).
  - New option "-V" for Cshell, send only VT100 compatible control
     sequences.
  - Internal variable "o_vt100" now used (if option -t or -V is set),
     don't send control sequences that are not VT100 compatible (eg,
     special Amiga control sequences).
  - Various changes/enhancements to existing commands.
  - Miscellaneous bug fixes.

- Terra Nova Development of Ventura, California has released Volume One of
  its Designer Objects series of 3D models.  This first volume, "DINER", 
  is a three disk set of objects for Impulse, Inc.'s Imagine software for
  Amiga computers.
  The Diner set includes a variety of objects that together build a
  complete diner of the early 1950's, including a jukebox, counter, 
  booths, a pay telephone, dishes, cups, silverware, and other items for
  place settings.  In many cases there are both `hi-res' and `lo-res' 
  versions versions of objects so that artists can optimize their scenes
  for either image quality or speedy rendering.
  In addition to the objects and image maps there are two Imagine projects
  on the disks.  One, with scenes that can be rendered on five megabyte
  systems, offers fairly simple scenes; the other features more complex
  scenes that require up to fourteen megabytes to render.  A manual is
  included.
  The Designer Objects series is intended to showcase the talents of
  gifted 3D artists by making available affordable collections of their 3D
  objects.  The Diner objects were created by award-winning computer artist
  Bradley W. Schenck, whose work should be familiar to the Amiga community
  through articles and artworks including wins in the BADGE Killer Demo
  Contests of 1988 and 1989.

  softwares like our "Bars & Pipes professional" are constructed for the
  Amiga first. Then we port our softwares to other platforms. The 
  multitasking nature of the Amiga, makes this computer number 1 source
  for the music and midi. We did a lot of improvments to the Track 
  Window Menu, Edit Window, Song Construction Window, Metronome, 
  printing, Tool and Accessories sections in the version 2.5 of the 
  "Bars & Pipes professional" but the development continues and we are
  designing the next majour update to the "Bars&Pipes". The new version
  will amoung other things support the MacroSystems Toccato"

  including locations for as many as six blocks, in the sample and the
  samples windowing data. There is also a sample sequencer with a capacity
  of up to 300 events. The sequencer provides fine control of the automated
  playback of samples. Sequencer files can be created, edited, saved and
  loaded. Clarity's MIDI mode lets you play samples via the Amiga's 
  keyboard or via a MIDI instrument. The Amiga's keyboard supports up to 10
  samples which can be adjusted over a nine-note range. The MIDI instrument
  supports a seven-octave range. Different samples can be assigned to 
  different ranges of the MIDI instrument. The sample assignments are 
  stored in MIDI Keyboard Map files which can be created, edited, loaded
  and saved. Clarity can also download and uploadith it but "The Edge" 
  will of course have it's own (fast) WB emulation/mode promotion 
  software. It uses 72 pin SIMMs (up to 8 megs via two SIMMs), and will

  More about this wonderful new release in a later issue of AmyNews

- Terra Nova Development announces the availability of Magic Lantern
  v2.0, the critically acclaimed 24 bit animation package for the Amiga.
  Magic Lantern version 2.0 allows users to create, edit and display
  delta compressed animations in up to 24 bit color on all the popular
  true color display cards for the Amiga, as well as all the native
  Amiga modes (including AGA). It will also play sound effects in either
  mono or stereo though the Amiga sound chip during animation play back.
  New features include virtual memory support; now animations can be as
  large as your hard disk, and Magic Lantern will still be able to edit
  and display them.  Double Time compression technology can double
  animation speed and reduce animation sizes by half.
  Another new compression technology has been added that can speed up
  some animations (especially those in 16 and 24 bit) by up to 25%, and
  reduce animation sizes by up to 20%.  Rebuilding animations has been
  optimized, and for large animations can be 75% faster.
  Direct support for the Retina Z3 has been added, resulting in
  animations that are up to 50% faster and 40% smaller for that card.
  Magic Lantern 2.0 still contains all the features of previous
  versions, including sound synchronization, enforcement of frame
  rates, full ARexx support, animation disassembly, palette changes and
  more. The new version 2.0 features:

  -  Added specific support for the Retina Z3. Animations now run from
     5% to 40% smaller than the Z2 model, and play 50% faster on the Z3
     card. The Retina Z3 appears to be at least twice as fast than the Z2
     on a stock 3000. Faster machines will gain more benefit
  -  Sped up all animation playback routines by a few percentage points
  - Created a new compression play back that can speed up some animations
    by up to 25% and reduce some animation file sizes by up to 20%
  - Sped up animation building for the Retina by up to 25% when building
    animations from memory
  - Sped up animation building for turbo animations by up to 25%
  - Eliminated necessity for Picasso animations to be of certain 
    resolutions to be fully optimized
  - Added DoubleTime technology.  Will decrease animation size by 40%-60%,
    increase potential play-back rate by 40%-60% at the cost of some 
    fuzziness in the animation
  - Sped up re-building animations that are in memory. Can be anywhere from
    10%-75% faster; larger animations get a bigger speed increase
  - Added a Retina Z2 to Z3 converter

- Sound/Noise tracker compatible module player for the Amiga, the D.A.S.
  ModulePlayer version 3.4 will be out soon. The new version has, among

- Powerful spreadsheet for the Amiga, TurboCalc, will jump directly from
  version 2.1 to 3.0. Lots of improvments are promissed. The goal is to
  make it equal or better than microsoft excel. TurboCalc supports SYLK
  format and in it's current version it's much like Excel. If you are
  familiar with Excel then you are familiar with TurboCalc too.
