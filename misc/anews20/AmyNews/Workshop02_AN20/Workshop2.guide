    Imagine 3.x Beginners Introduction.

    Many people find it very hard to render their very first pictures using
    Imagine. Imagine's manual is not of much help to beginers although the
    new manual is higly improved. This guide is dedicated to the new Imagine
    users. It's a simple step by step guided tour in rendering an image using
    Imagine.

    In Workshop 2 we will introduce beginners to Imagine.

    To make best use of this Workshop it's best to have
    both Imagine and this Guide open at the same time so
    you won't have to remember all instructions.

    Please note that the workshop is intended for beginners
    and might not be of much use to expirienced users.
    
    A configuration file for Imagine 3.x is included with
    the workshop. If you have assigned IMAGINE: to your
    Imagine directory you can press the button on the
    bottom of this page, otherwise you will have to
    copy if by yourself. The filename is "Imagine.config".
    
    This button will rename your old config to "Imagine.config1"
    and copy the included configuration file to IMAGINE:

    As mentioned before, this time I have chosen to make an 
    introduction to Imagine.

    First I'd like to tell you why I chose Imagine for this 
    workshop, becouse as you know there is many alternatives 
    availible for the Amiga Platform.
    Imagine has two advantages over most other raytracing
    programs. 
    It's fairly easy to learn and you don't need an 
    Amiga 4000 with 16 megs of RAM.

    For this workshop you will need an Amiga with at least 
    4Mb of RAM. 6Mb is recommended.

    To make this workshop easier to understand, I've decided to
    include my configuration file for Imagine. This way, there
    won't be any trouble finding buttons etc.

    This workshop consists of 4 chapters, each with it's
    own subject.

    I assume that you have figured out how to make Projects
    in Imagine. Please make a new Project with a Rendering
    Subproject.

    Chapter 1 - The Detail Editor.

    Detail Editor is where you design your own objects.
    (Forms Editor is for the same purpose, but is used
    in another way.)

    Many of the buttons on the bottom of the screen are
    also availble in the menus. You can make new buttons 
    in Preferences.

    Objects in Detail Editor are built of one or more
    'primitives'. These are the basic forms.
    Press the 'Prim' button to pop up a requester with a
    choise of 6 different primatives.

    Feel free to try out all 6 forms, but for now, choose
    'Sphere'.
    
    The requester changes and you can now choose the 
    dimensions of the sphere. You can also change the 
    amount of 'Sections' in it. The more sections you 
    have, the more detailed the object will be.
    Set the values to 50, 25, 20.
    
    You can now see a sphere in all of the four views.
    The three views, Top, Right and Front have no need
    to be explained. The four views can be (un)zoomed
    by pressing the the blue bar beside them.
    In the view 'Persp' you can see the sphere in black.
    With the buttons A, Z and P you can change (A)ngle,
    (Z)oom and (P)erspective.
    In the Display menu there is four choises witch make
    the display of the 'Persp' view different.
    These are Wireframe, Solid, Shaded and Newmode.
    Try them all out.
    
    Press the button 'ZI' (Zoom In) two times to
    get the sphere to fill the whole view.
    Now, press the 'Front' bar. You should now see the
    sphere from it's side.
    Press the button 'Mag' and 'MS' besides it. In this 
    requester, set the vaules to 100, 0, 0.
    Use the type 'Bell'.
    Now make the object active and choose 'Drag Points'
    from the Mode menu.
    Press and hold on the dot in the top of the sphere.
    Now pull the mouse down as you hold the mousebutton
    down. Release it in the mittle.
    
    Choose 'Pick Groups' from the Mode menu and look
    at the object in the 'Persp' view. If you use
    the Solid option, you will see the object a little
    bit better.
    
    Now press the 'Prim' Button again and make another
    sphere.
    
    This time set the values to 15, 20, 10.
    
    To select this sphere use 'Pick Select' from the
    Pick/Select menu. Move it so that your screen will
    look like the 'Chapter1.iff' picture.
    
    Now select both objects(hold 'Shift' down) and
    use 'Group' from the States menu. This is required
    to save the objects in one file.
    
    Now select the group and save it in your Project.
    
    The object you have just made is an example to be
    used in the next Chapters.
    Remember that if you want to make complex objects
    you will need a lot of patience and imagination.

    Chapter 2 - Attributes.


    The attributes of an Object is also set in Detail
    editor (Stage also if 3.x).

    Load the example object that we made in Chapter 1.
    Select it(the whole group) and choose 'Attributes'
    from the Functions menu.

    In this requester you can change how the objects
    surface will look like.

    Some of the options can be set with the RGB bars, 
    some with the 'Value' bar.

    Brushes are iff-pictures mapped around the object.
    Textures doesn't take as much memory as brushes
    and they are faster.
    
    Set Color to 200,200,255.
    Set Specular to 255,255,255.
    Set Hardness to 255.
    
    Use the texture BumpNoiz with the default values.
    
    Now we have set the attributes for the big object
    in your group. Now select the little ball and
    choose Attributes.
    
    This object will be of metal and the easiest way
    to do this is to use the texture Metals.
    
    In the first box(metals texture) set the value to
    5 (Silver). And in the first box on the right side
    set the value to 1 (Smooth).
    
    Set Specular to 255,255,255.
    
    Now our objects are ready for rendering.
    
    If you like, you could do a 'Quickrender'. This
    is a fast rendering without having to set the
    lights etc. To do this use the 'Prev' view to
    position the objects and choose 'Quickrender'
    from the project menu.
    
    Remember that quick render is in 'Scanline' mode
    and no reflections or shadows will be rendered.
    This can be changed in preferences though.
    
    The included preferences use a very small display
    for quick render. This can also be changed.

    Chapter 3 - The Stage and Action Editor.


    To be able to use the stage editor, you must have
    a project open.

    The Stage editor looks just like the Detail editor.
    the difference is the functions.

    Activate the CView button. This makes the Prev view
    show the camera perspective.

    Load the objects we made in Chapter 1 with 'Load'
    from Object menu.

    Now choose 'Light Source' from Add in Object menu.
    This 'Lamp' is handled just like any other object
    and it's very important to position it right.

    In some cases you will need two or more lightsources to
    make the scene look good. Not in this case though.

    Everything we need for this scene is now ready.
    Now we only have to position the lightsource and
    the camera. Refer to the screenshot picture in this
    chapter.

    The camera has to be tracked to our object. To do this,
    activate the camera and choose 'Camera (Re)track' from
    Object menu. The name of our object is 'SPHERE'.

    Now choose 'Save Changes' from Project menu.


    Change to the Action editor.

    In the Action editor you edit the same things as in
    Stage editor, but in another way.
    The objects is not shown in 3D as in Stage editor.
    You edit the positions, size, etc. by changing numbers.
    This is ideal for animations.

    Some things is only availble from the Action editor
    like 'Globals' and 'F/X'.
    Globals is an entry in Action editor that is used to
    change the backround and global fog and much more.

    If you want you can use a 'Global Brush'. This is an
    IFF picture that is reflected on every object in
    the scene. Be careful not to use a picture that doesn't
    fit with the scene.
    You choose the global brush in 'Globals'.

    Now bring up the settings for the lightsource by pressing
    the red Actor dot on frame 1.

    Press the button 'Cast Shadows'.

    The scene should now be ready for rendering, described in
    Chapter 4.

    Chapter 4 - Rendering


    All renderings except 'Quick Render' is made from
    the Project editor.

    You must have a Rendering sub-project open to render.

    Press the 'Modify' button.

    Here you can change the render mode, screen size and
    save format.

    If you have enough memory use 'Trace' rendermode.
    If not use 'Scanline' mode, this will disable shadows
    and reflections though.

    Press the preset button and use the predefined Lowres
    resuloution. Use the saveformat ILBM-24 is you have
    AGA and ILBM-12 if you have ECS,OCS.

    The number(s) in the mittle of the screen are frames
    in your project. To render a picture you must select
    the number. In this project there should be only '1'.

    Press 'Generate' button to render the picture.

    You can show the picture by pressing the 'Show' button.
