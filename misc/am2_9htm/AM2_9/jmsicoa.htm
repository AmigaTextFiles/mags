FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

User Rep Election 98
The Election Procedures


IN COOPERATION WITH THE JMS, TEAM AMIGA WORLDWIDE, and ICOA


The bylaws of the Industry Council of Open Amiga require that the
Steering Committee have 1 full voting seat to be occupied by a user
representative selected in the manner deemed by the ICOA to be the
most productive way in which to provide a user representative.

Therefore, the Transitional Steering Committee (TSC) of the ICOA
invited proposals from the Amiga community at large on selection
procedures for the selection of a User Representative. The JMS
answered this invitation with a set of proposals and procedures
that were hampered by time restrictions not of its making.

When voting was verified, there were several votes disqualified due to
being of a fraudulent nature, leaving three of the candidates all but
tied. Consultations between the nominees, the JMS, and Team
AMIGA made it clear that corrective action needed to be taken.

Because of the time constraints, lack of proper publicity, and
fraudulent votes, The JMS in conjunction with Team AMIGA asked for
and obtained permission to hold a new vote with ample time for
publicity, nominations, and voting from a much wider audience
than previously attained.

-----

Following are the new procedures outlined to gain a wider voting
audience. We urge each of you to take advantage of this opportunity to
nominate and elect a User Representative of your choice.

The person elected will serve as your spokesperson in the building of
a new Amiga future. Choose wisely, but choose ...

make an official complaint by writing to either Andrew Elia
<andrew@amigasoc.org> of the Amiga Society in London or Gary
Peake <gpeake@wt.net> of Team AMIGA. They will decide if the
complaint is justified and, if so, what must be done to make
things right. The JMS, Team AMIGA, and the ICOA disclaim all
responsibility for disruption in the election procedures due to
failures in the network or in the equipment used by their service
providers.
