<HR>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">There's no hidden meaning to the name "Feedback." This is simply the department in which we publish reader feedback to The Amiga Monitor. It can be about The Amiga Monitor as a whole, an article published in AM, the Amiga community in general, or anything you consider appropriate. Comments and suggestions are welcome.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Please note that any messages sent in any way to AM are subject to being published in Feedback, unless you request otherwise. However, to "officially" submit something to Feedback, send a message to <A HREF="mailto:mrw11@cornell.edu (Feedback)">mrw11@cornell.edu</A> (please check <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html">The AM Link Redirection Page</A> for an up-to-date e-mail address first if possible, but otherwise use this address).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We will not guarantee publication of anything sent to Feedback. We reserve the right to revise any messages before publishing them.</P>
