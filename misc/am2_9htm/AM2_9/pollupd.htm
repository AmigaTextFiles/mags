<P ALIGN="LEFT">47 responses is still a bit lower than I expected, but numbers are really starting to stabilize a bit. If this trend continues, then it looks like AOL better start development on the product. :)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One of the comments received indicated that if there was an 'all-in-one' Internet product similar to what is included on the other computer systems, then we wouldn't need AOL. (Of course, if that was true, then we wouldn't be having this poll. :) The rumors have it that OS 3.5 is going to include something to that effect. The only problem is that a good portion of the Amiga users out there that have no modems have no access to the information that there is a new OS that they should buy. Unless the powers that be advertise.</P>
