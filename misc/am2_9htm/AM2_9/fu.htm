<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hello everyone...</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As you all know I've been trying to negotiate with Mirabilis for an Amiga port of ICQ.. Recently I sent a rather lengthy proposal to Yair Goldfinger of Mirabilis on assurance he'd reply to it within 2 days after more than 2 weeks he still hasn't replied.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I also have also sent a copy to Sefi (the president of Mirabilis)and have received no reply from him either..</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So now I am asking all of you to help me by emailing the following addresses and asking the following questions:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Why have you not replied to Brian Gilbert's Proposal as promised.
<LI>Why aren't you supporting the Amiga platform.
<LI>You have a group of people offering to make AmigaICQ for you free of charge while also signing NDA's to assure the security of your protocol and yet you still won't even grant them decent communication to try and negotiate properly with you..
</OL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The e-mails that I'd ask you to send mails with these questions to are..</P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="sefi@icq.com">sefi@icq.com</A>
<LI><A HREF="yair@icq.com">yair@icq.com</A>
<LI><A HREF="info@icq.com">info@icq.com</A>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Thank you in advance and keep in mind that by doing this you can make AmigaICQ a reality..</P>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">
Yours sincerely
<BR>
Brian Gilbert.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hello,</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We appreciate the suggestions and offers. All our users are important to us regardless of the platform they use, which is why our Amiga users have two options: they can either use the ICQ Java version or download a Mac emulator and use the 68k Mac versions. Both ICQ versions can be downloaded from our main download site at <A HREF="http://www.mirabilis.com/download">http://www.mirabilis.com/download</A></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Thank you.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If this answer has not satisfied you, or if you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to write us back. Your satisfaction is very important to us.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Mirabilis Support Team</P>
