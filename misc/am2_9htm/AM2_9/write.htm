<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Guidelines for Writing for The Amiga Monitor</H1>
<HR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Amiga Monitor is always looking for new writers.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you would like to write for AM, you can simply send a completed article to us at <A HREF="mailto:mrw11@cornell.edu">mrw11@cornell.edu</A> (please check <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html">The AM Link Redirection Page</A> for an up-to-date e-mail address first if possible, but otherwise use this address). Please note that it is at the discretion of the AM Editorial Staff as to whether articles will be published, and we reserve the right to make or request revisions. If we do publish your article, we will list you by name and e-mail address (and web site if provided) as a Contributing Writer in the issue in which your article is published, unless you request to remain anonymous.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If, however, you would like to contact us ahead of time to discuss one or more articles you would like to write (if, for instance, you wish to clear a topic with us before doing the writing, or if you are interested in earning a more permanent position on the staff list), please contact us at <A HREF="mailto:KyleWebb@aol.com (Write for AM)">KyleWebb@aol.com</A> (please check <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html">The AM Link Redirection Page</A> for an up-to-date e-mail address first if possible, but otherwise use this address).</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Become an AM Staff Member</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As noted above, non-staff members who write for AM are listed as Contributing Writers in the issues in which their work appears. However, people who work in the capacity of Contributing Writers on a regular basis can earn more permanent listings as Staff Writers, who are listed in every issue. If you are interested in this, feel free to contact us as listed above.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But you may also feel free to suggest an entirely new type of staff position you would be willing to fill. If we don't have a particular position on the staff, more likely it is due to resource limitations than to a conscious decision to exclude that position. Again, contact us as listed above if you are interested.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Either way, however, please note that being an AM Staff Member, while not a huge commitment, is also not a commitment to be taken lightly. Staff Writers are expected to produce on a regular basis, at least three times per year. Contributing Editors are expected to contribute something almost every month. Please be sure you can live up to this if you want to become a member of the staff.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><I>A few notes on article submission...</I></H3>

<UL>
<LI>Articles should be written in English.
<LI>Articles should be sent in ASCII format; HTML codes are permissible.
<LI>Images are permissible, and in fact welcomed, as judicious use of graphics can greatly increase the quality of an article. If you do choose to include images, please use IFF, JPEG, or GIF format, and archive your entire article with LhA, LZH, or LZX.
<LI>Personal e-mail signatures, URL's, etc. are permitted to be included in an article.
<LI>Once sent to us, your writing becomes public domain under the <A HREF="reprint.htm">AM Reprint Policy</A> unless you explicitly request otherwise.
<LI>We often count on you to come up with specific ideas for articles. Although you are welcome to get in contact with us simply to announce your interest in writing for us, please do not be surprised if we don't have any specific "assignments" for you right away. It is generally best if those who wish to write know exactly what they want to write about.
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">And lastly, again,</P>

<UL>
<LI>It is ultimately at the discretion of the staff of The Amiga Monitor as to whether articles will be published.
</UL>
