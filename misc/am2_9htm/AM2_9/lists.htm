There are currently four lists; send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:mrw11@cornell.edu">mrw11@cornell.edu</A> (please check <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html">The AM Link Redirection Page</A> for an up-to-date e-mail address first if possible, but otherwise use this address) in which specify the list(s) you would like to join:</P>

<UL>
<LI>HTML format archived with LhA
<LI>HTML format archived with ZIP
<LI>AmigaGuide format archived with LhA
<LI>HTML format notification of availability
<LI>AmigaGuide format notification of availability
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If we successfully receive and process your request, you will receive notification that you have been added to a list. If you do not receive a response within two weeks, please check to see that your correct e-mail address is included with the message, and resend your request.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">A Few Notes on the Distribution Lists...</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our Publisher sends the AM archives out through his mailbox enough times each month without it coming in several times as well. Please make his life a little easier, and do your best to prevent bouncebacks:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Please notify us if your e-mail address changes.
<LI>Also, please make sure your provider can handle fairly large attached files. The AM archives generally range in size from 50 kB to 500 kB. We can tolerate it if you have problems with some of the larger ones, but if there are consistent problems with smaller archives, we may have to consider finding a different way to deliver the magazine to you.
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Depending on the error message specified in the bounced-back message, we may automatically remove an address from a list upon receiving a bounceback.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">About the AmigaGuide Edition</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We are currently many months behind in the conversion of HTML to AmigaGuide. We intend to correct this problem, but for now, consider this if you are trying to decide which list(s) to join.</P>
