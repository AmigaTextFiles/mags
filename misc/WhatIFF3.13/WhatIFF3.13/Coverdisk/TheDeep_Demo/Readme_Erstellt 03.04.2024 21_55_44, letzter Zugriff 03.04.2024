You are here for fishing... cough cough no...

Nobody knows how long the sunken ship has been sitting
at the bottom of the ocean. It was the proudest ship of
a great fleet. Some fish say that it was sailed by 
Captain Redbeard himself, and that he still haunts the
ship today. You want this treasure !!! 50 loads of gold!
