<HTML><H2><B>Setting Up a Web Browser to Read AmigaGuides and Animations</B></H2>

<P>There are some amigaguides we have provided with this diskmag. If you are reading the amigaguide version, then you have no worries here, but with the HTML version, you can set your browser up so the guide is loaded onto the workbench screen. When you've finished, just close the amigaguide and return to the web browser.

<P>Check out the settings option, and there should be options for various types of files (under 'MIME' in Voyager). Add a New one, with Type as Text/amigaguide (or whatever), extensions as 'guide', and then the action to view with external program. So in 
Voyager, action is 'Use External Application' and the application is 'amigaguide' (or 'c:amigaguide'; wherever it is located). Remember to save the settings if necessary!

<P>If you prefer (or if this doesn't work?) you can of course load the amigaguides separately. They will all be in the Mag<B>x</B>/ drawer (or in a sub drawer), where <B>x</B> is the issue number of this mag.

<P>The same is true of IFF animations, just choose Type as Video/anim (or whatever) and Use External Application. Select your favourite anim player (ViewTek/vt for example), and it should work fine!
