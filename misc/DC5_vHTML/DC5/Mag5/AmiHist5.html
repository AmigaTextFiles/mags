<P>Part Five: </B>The End of Commodore

<P>Where were you the day Commodore went bust... Okay, I don't remember, but I do remember that it came pretty much out of the blue, or so it seemed.

<P>There had been warning signs; previous issues of AF said things like Commodore Australia in trouble, and lots of graphs showing a downward trouble. But these were small news items, so no one took any notice - until Commodore US had gone bust, and all that remained was Commodore UK with David Pleasance and co.

<P>There were the Amiga mags telling us how UK users would be unlikely to be affected, which of course couldn't have been further from the truth.

<P>Looking through magazines of the time, it certainly seemed like the dark ages. Stocks of A1200s gradually dried up, by Christmas, there were virtually none available. Strangely, the CD32 never seemed to become unavailable...

<P>Every month's editorial of Amiga Format seemed to follow the same format of 'We were going to bring you news of the buyout, but it hasn't *quite* yet happened, so we'll tell you next month'.

<P>We had Commodore UK telling us how Mr Pleasance was going to save the day, backed by an unknown investor (did they ever reveal 
who it was?) and the Creative Equipment wanting to do god knows what with the Amiga.

<BR>Next issue... 1995 - Escom; The Amiga's Saviour... or not (ho 
ho)

It should be noted that this issue's Amiga History is *significantly* smaller than usual. This is not because the author has grown bored of writing this particular series of articles, rather, being at university, he is currently parted from his vast collection of Amiga Formats, and has to rely on his 
somewhat lacking memory regarding what actually happened during this particular era of Amiga history.
