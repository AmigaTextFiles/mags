<HTML><H2><B>Spectrum Emulation</B></H2>

<P>I'm currently under the belief that the Internet was <I>made</I> for Spectrum emulation. You see, I've had speccy emulators for a while now (Speculator and ZXAM do fine), but I only had a few games, and many of the old classics I used to love 
(yes, I once had a Speccy 128k +3 - the one with floppy drive!), I just couldn't find.

<P>On the internet, that's a different story... I'm now enjoying 'The Great Escape' (anyone know how to complete it???), as well as Rampage and various Dizzy incarnations.

<P>But what I <B>really</B> want is a 128k emulator, and at appears that the Amiga does not yet have one of those ;(

<P>One of my favourite games, 'Where Time Stood Still', is sadly 128k only (all those extra memory hungary graphics, you see...) I  load it, and get the title screen with the wonderful music, but as soon as the game starts, it crashes with an out of memory error (amusing in a way, considering I have enough memory to house 80 Speccy 128k's...)

<P>I found on the internet a page saying that the emulator ZX Spectrum v5 supports 128k - but I can only find v7! (Anyone know if this is true, or where to get it?). ZXAM author is reportedly working on a new version for 128k, but I've seen nothing yet...

<P>Oh well. Some people have said that all this emulation is a bit pointless considering that you can get real 8 bits for hardly 
anything. True, but consider this:<UL>
<LI>Speccy tapes took about 5 minutes to load, games from hard disk take about 0.5 seconds. I could probably dash down to my college computer room, get onto the net, find a speccy games site, down load the game and rush back to my room and load it faster than a speccy tape would load...
<LI>Nowadays, snapshot files for emulator use are much more common than tapes.
<LI>And another favourite of mine... Not all speccy games let you 
save your position, but the Snapshot format is just that - a snapshot of the Specturm's RAM and Z80 registers. So to save a position, just save the game as a snapshot, and then load it straight in when you're done! Just remember not to overwrite the original snapshot of the game, though...</UL

<P>Anyway, must be off. Rampage and Gift From The Gods await...

<B>Addendum</B> I'm still craving for a 128k emulator, and have realised maybe I could do it via Shapeshifter, given that there is a Mac speccy 128k emulator (Mac Spectacle). Unforntunately, getting downloaded Mac programs to work is like electronic pass-the-parcel. First I de-binhex the file (I can do this on the 
'Mac' or my Amiga), then I must decompress the resultant file with StuffIt - I have yet to get the Mac version of StuffIt (as you need StuffIt to decompress StuffIt...) but I found a PC program which did the job. I get the files, and pass it back to the Mac, but the prize still isn't there; the program's stored in 
FatBinary format (I think that means 680x0 and PPC versions in one) which has to be split up (a program called Splitter, it says to use). I haven't found any such programs which do the job...

<P>And to think people complain about dearchiving Aminet lha's...
