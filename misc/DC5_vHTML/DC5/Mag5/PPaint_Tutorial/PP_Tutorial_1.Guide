@node main "Welcome To The Personal Paint Tutorial"

Hello  there and welcome to the Doubleclick!  Personal Paint Tutorial,
written by me, @{"Stephen Graham" link author}.

Over  the  next few issues we will try and show you how  to  get  some
great  effects from Personal Paint,  to let you produce some fantastic
artwork.  Most of the Artwork that you see in this magazine  has  been
produced using Personal Paint V6.3.  There are newer versions  on  the
market now (Currently there was V6.4,  then V7), but they do not offer
a great deal more than the version we shall be using.

First,  we shall take a tour of the basic functions that you will find
on the Toolbar, on the PPaint screen.

@{"Toolbar Menu" link toolbarmenu}

Then after that, we shall look at what each Menu item does

@{"Pull Down Menus" link pulldown}

After you have mastered that,  it is time to draw.  We shall show  you
some of the more fancy effects that PPaint can achieve, using Gradient
Fills, Stencils, and Image Processing.

@{"Special Effects" link effects}

One final topic we could cover will be Personal Paint's ability to
construct animations.

Or you could try to phone me:  (0468) 508 871, but be warned as it's a
mobile phone.

Here is a list of my total computer Setup:
@{b}
A1200 with internal 2½" 260 MB Hard Drive 
Appollo 1220 4 MB Memory Board with 68882 Maths Co-Processor plus Clock
2 External Floppy Disk Drives  
Citizen ABC 24 Pin Dot Matrix Colour Printer 
Panasonic KX-P1180 9 Pin Dot Matrix Black & White Printer 
Goliath Upgrated Power Supply 
Wizard Developments Black 3 Button Mouse 
RoboShift Joystick / Mouse Splitter
Camlink Stereo Sound Mixer 
Konix Sppedking Joystick (Which  I have  had  for 5 years!)  
Konix Navigator Joystick (Which I have had for a lot longer!)

A600 with 1 MB Trapdoor Memory Upgrade plus Battery Backed Clock

A500+ (But I have no RF Modulator)

Cambridge Z88 Laptop (Soon to have a Connection to the Amiga A1200)

2 ZX-81's (one with a 16K (Wow - 16K!) Memory Upgrade)
ZX Thermal Paper Printer (Like a Mini FAX Machine)

2 ZX Spectrum +2's (One is the Black +2A with the lightgun)

@{ub}

I  have  been  collecting Public Domain for  a  few  years  now,   and
although  my collection is not very large,  (350 ish disks),   I  have
quite a lot of other disks from mags etc,  and friends. I also run the
latest  version  of Virus Checker and Virus Z 2 on startup  to  combat
virus infection.

I  have  been interested in computing from a very early age.  My  very
first  computer was a ZX81 (remember them!)  with a full 16K  upgrade!
Wow!  I had two of them before I upgraded to a ZX Spectrum (the  first
one  with the dead man finger keys!).  From there I bought  a  48K  ZX
Spectrum (The black one with the fold down feet),  and from that a  ZX
Spectrum +2,  which at the time was the cutting edge of technology.  A
whole 128 KB of power.  I also had a Radio Shack TRS-80,  which I only
used for playing chess and Card Games - it was that primitive.  

I  then decided it was time for a change,  and bought an A600 with  my
brother.  Wow!  Programs that loaded in less than three days, and they
had  decent  sound and graphics.  I was converted.  I had  a  shot  of
friend's  Atari ST,  but it was not the same - The Amiga was  the  one
for me!

Soom  after  this  my brother and I,  who owned  half  of  the  Amiga,
decided  to  upgrade  up  to an A1200.  We did  and  since  them  have
expanded  the  system.  We bought the printer first  because  we  were
currently  using  an Epson 9 pin Black & White  and  the  quality  was
quite literally,  crap! We have since bought the Hard Drive (Notice to
all  non-Hard  Drive owners:- GET ONE NOW.  YOU WILL NOT  BELIEVE  THE
DIFFERENCE!),  and we are currently saving up for a CD-ROM,   a  Sound
Sampler and an Colour Inkjet Printer.

I also own a Cambridge Z88 Laptop computer, which is handy to type out
your letters when you are out and about,  or away from home. I am just
about  to  buy  a  cable that connects the Z88 to  your  Amiga.   It`s
something I`ve wanted for a long time.  Eventually, I got it. All good
things  come to those who wait.  

I  also have a Phillips CDi with the Digital Video Cartridge,  lots of
films  and  games etc.  It is a brilliant machine to play with.   Does
anybody  else have one,  and would like to swap tips etc about  games,
and maybe even some discs?

I was elected a member of Pentrisoft, a user group for the Amiga which
is  aimed at the Shareware side of Computing,  last year,  and we have
many members all over the world, from the UK to the USA!

I  am  now also a Co-Editor for Doubleclick!,  the Amiga disk magazine
produced  regularly  by Pentrisoft.  It is freely  available  from  PD
Libraries,   as  well  as Pentrisoft,  Amicom PD,   Mark  Harman  (The
Pentrisoft President,  and the other Doubleclick!  Editor), as well as
myself.  A worthy read which has loads of articles to suit just  about
any taste.

I work in the mornings delivering newspapers.  After that I work as  a
mechanic in my father`s garage,  fixing cars. From time to time I am a
DJ,   who  runs his own mobile disco (which was paid for  out  of  the
paper round - think of the price of CD`s and equipment etc).

My  main  interests  are  Cars,  for obvious reasons,   Computing  and
Motorcycling.   I  want  anything  you  like  on  the  disks,   Demos,
slideshows,   games,  utils,  you name it,  I want  it.   All  letters
answered 1200%.

Thanks for watching, and send me your jiffys.

@node toolbarmenu "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Toolbar"

The  toolbar is effectively what controls most of the basic  functions
in  Personal  Paint.  It is situated on the  left  hand  side  of  the
worktop,  or screen,  in much the same way as the Workbench screen  is
set out,  with all the important icons on the left.  You can switch on
or  switch  off (toggle)  the Toolbar by pressing F9 on the  keyboard.
You  can also press F10 to toggle the Titlebar,  which sits along  the
top  edge of the screen.  The Titlebar contains information about  the
name  of the image you are currently working on,  and the position  of
the  cursor.  By removing these options,  you are able to see more  of
the image you are working on, and this makes it easier to edit it.

@{"Click  for a picture of the ToolBar" system "C:vt Pics/Toolbar.PNG"

Now  you know what the Toolbar looks like,  and what each tool  in  it
does. To find out about a certain tool, please click below.

@node tool1 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Brushes Bank"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/1.Brush" 0}

This  box  contains  the  different drawing  tools  that  you  use  to
construct  your  image.  Along the top of the  box  are  the  circular
drawing  brushes,   and along the bottom of the  box  are  the  square
brushes.   The  number  in  the bottom left  hand  of  the  box  (1-9)
corresponds  to  the  user defined brush that  you  can  use.   It  is
possible to cut out part of an image and use it as a drawing brush  as
well.

To  select  a  brush from this box,  left click on the brush  of  your
choice.

If  you want to use a brush of a different size than the ones offered,
then  all you do is right click on the brush nearest the one you want,
and use the mouse to resize it until the desired size is reached.  You
can also make elliptical or rectangular brushes in this way.

If you right click on the user defined brush (the number), a small pop
up  menu  will appear with the numbers 1-9 on it.  It is  possible  to
have  up  to  9  user defined brushes and by selecting the appropriate
number,  you can select your desired brush.  When the desired brush is
chosen,   its  number will appear in the box instead  of  the  default
number, 1.

@node tool2 "Personal Paint Tutorial - Dotted Freehand"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/2.Brush" 0}

This  is probably the tool that you will use the most,  and it is  the
simplest to use.  To use it, place the cursor where you want to paint,
and  press the left mouse button.  You can hold the button down,   and
move  the mouse around,  and wherever you have been,  a trail will  be
left.   To paint with the current foreground colour,  press  the  left
mouse  button,  and use the right mouse button to paint in the current
background colour.

If  you move the mouse quickly while pressing either button,  you will
get  a  series  of  dots  instead of a continous line.   The  distance
between  the  dots will depend on how fast you move the mouse.   Also,
the  speed  of  the  processor  in   the  Amiga  will  be  taken  into
consideration,  although this is marginal. A faster computer will find
it  easier  to  catch  up  with the pointer  and  print  to  a  higher
resolution.

@node tool3 "Personal Paint Tutorial - Continous Freehand"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/3.Brush" 0}

This  is  essentially the same as Dotted Freehand,   but  draws  in  a
continous line,  instead of a series of dots.  If you click  with  the
left hand button on the top half of the box,  then you can draw a line
totally freehand with no shading.  If you click on the bottom half  of
the box however,  and draw a line, and areas that are enclosed by that
line are filled.

If  you  right  click on the box while you are in line mode,   a  line
settings  box appears where you are able to choose the  kind  of  line
that you wish to draw with.  You can choose from a continous line,  or
an  on/off (dotted)  line,  or a patterned line,  using a user defined
brush.

If you right click while in area mode,  you are shown an area settings
box,  where you can choose from a solid,  gradient, or pattern fill. A
normal solid fill, will use either the background or foreground colur,
depending on whatever colour you are using.  A gradient fill is a  bit
different.  You can fill using a range of colours, in a range of ways.
More  about  that later.  A Pattern fill,  will use  either  a  normal
dithered  pattern,  or a tiled pattern made up  from  a  user  defined
brush.   There is a list below in the window of the different  brushes
that you can use, as well as a window to show what each brush is.

@node tool4 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Curve Tool"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/4.Brush" 0}

Clicking on this tool will produce a straight line tool.  Click on the
start  and  finish of the curve,  and then you have 4 corner reference
points  to shape the curve.  By clicking on either side of  the  line,
you  will shape the curve to your liking.  When you have got the shape
that  you  want then click on the right mouse button.  The curve  will
then change colour to your selected colour, so by starting the process
by  clicking  the  right mouse button,  the curve  will  finish  as  a
background colour,  and by starting with the left button, it will be a
foreground colour.

To  quote  the  Personal Paint handbook,  which I think  explains  the
situation perfectly:-

"The exact definition of this type of curve is 'Bezier cubic section'.
The  four  points geometrically define the shape of  the  curve.   The
curve  starts at the first point,  at a tangent to the line  from  the
first to the second point,  and ends at the fourth point, at a tangent
to  the  line  which joins the last two points.  The curve  is  always
enclosed by the convex quadrilateral defined by the points."

@node tool5 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Straight Line Tool"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/5.Brush" 0}

This tool is very simple.  All you do is draw straight lines with  it.
Click on either button to pick your colour,  and at the start  of  the
line.   Drag  the pointer until you reach the end of your  line,   and
release the button. Simple as that.

If  you  are  a  bit  shaky  when it comes to freehand  line  drawing,
Personal Paint has a bit of a trick which you can use, which will lock
the  pointer in one plane,  either horizontally or vertically.   Start
your line,  and move at least one pixel in the desired direction. Then
press Shift,  while still holding the mouse button,  and carry on. You
can now move the mouse in the different plane, and it will not matter,
as  the direction has been locked.  This function will cease when  you
let go of Shift, so you could use it for a number of tasks at once.

@node tool6 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Circle Tool"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/6.Brush" 0}

Drawing  circles has always been a bit of a footer,  until  the  paint
package people thought of this tool.  It is a very powerful tool,  and
is one of the most used.

Simple  in  its use,  either press left or right for colour,  ensuring
that  you are starting in the centre of the circle.  Move the  pointer
to the edge of the circle, and release the button.

If  you  click  on the bottom half of the tool,  you can  construct  a
filled  circle,  but remeber that these are covered by the  area  fill
settings, so make sure that you have the correct setting enabled.

@node tool7 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Rectangle Tool"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/7.Brush" 0}

This  tool  effectively draws squares and rectangles.  By clicking  on
your  choice  of colour (left or right button),  and dragging  to  the
opposite corner (ie start in bottom left,  finish in top right),   and
letting go of the button,  a rectangle will be formed. Clicking on the
bottom half of the tool, as usual, will select a filled shape, so area
fillings apply as well.

@node tool8 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Ellipse Tool"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/8.Brush" 0}

This is similar to the circle tool,  in that you draw a circle, except
you now have depth, to construct the different angles of the sides, so
by  placing  the  cursor at different angles and  distances  from  the
centre  point  of  the circle,  you can construct different  ellipses.
Fill settings etc apply if you click on the bottom half of the tool as
usual.

@node tool9 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Polygon Tool"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/9.Brush" 0}

This  tool allows you to draw objects of an irregular shape and  size.
Click  on  the tool with the left or right button,  depending  on  the
colour required.  Click where the shape is to start, and you will have
a line tool appear, which you should use to draw a side of your shape,
and  you  can repeat this process until the desired shape is achieved.
To finish,  and to complete the shape, draw your last line back to the
start of the shape.

If you clicked the top half of the tool to start,  then the shape will
be an outline, but by clicking on the bottom half, any completed areas
will  be  filled.   Area fill settings will of course  be  taken  into
account.

@node tool10 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Airbrush Tool"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/10.Brush" 0}

This is effectively the same as a normal aerosol spray can.  Click  on
either button for your desired colour,  and hold the button, and spray
freehand.  As with a real spray can,  the longer you stay in the  same
position, the more paint you will deposit.

By clicking on the tool with the right button,  an options screen will
appear.   You  can  select either an elliptical or  rectangular  spray
nozzle,   and change the amounts of jets that spray at any  one  time.
You  can also adjust the size of the spray head,  by clicking  on  the
Adjust button.  The spray head will appear, and all you do is hold the
left button, and move the mouse until the desired size is reached.

@node tool11 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Area Fill Tool"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/11.Brush" 0}

This  is one of the tools that you will probably use the most.  It  is
basically  a  tool to change the colour of areas of the picture  which
are the same colour as the pixel that the pointer is on.  It will  not
change all pixels on the screen of the same colour - you are  best  to
use the palette to do that.

Click  on  the tool with the left button,  and the desired  area  with
either button, depending on which colour you wish.

If you click on the tool with the right button,  you will be given the
area  fill  settings screen,  where you can chsnge the  type  of  fill
required.

You  basically have three types of fill,  Solid,  Gradient &  Pattern.
Solid  is easy - one colour,  and is a normal colour change.  Gradient
is much more complex.  You can specify a start and end colour from the
palette (it uses a range from the background to the foreground),   and
have  either a few steps or many steps in between.  You can  have  the
gradient  either displayed horizontally or vertically,  or both  ways.
Pattern fill uses a brush from the user defined brushes,  and tiles it
to make a backdrop, which can then be applied to the image.

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/12.Brush" 0}

You are best to start using this tool by clicking on it with the right
button.   You are then shown a standard Font Requester window,   which
you  use  to  select the font that you require,  it's size,   and  any
effects that you wish to apply to it (Bold, Italics, Underline).

You  then  click  on  the left button,  select your  colour  from  the
palette  with  the  left button,  and move  the  text  cursor  to  the
position you wish on the screen,  clickthe left button,  and start  to
type.   Any  future changes to colour can be made by clicking  on  the
palette  with the left button,  and the right button on the  tool  for
changing the font or font style.

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/13.Brush" 0}

In using this tool,  you can change the whole appearance of your image
by  using preset routines,  which can do a number of things like  blur
the  image,   sharpen the image,  change the image into a  watercolour
painting etc.

This is covered in greater detail in the Special Effects section.

@node tool14 "Personal Paint Tutorial - Snap To Grid"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/14.Brush" 0}

This  is  a  tool that will only let you draw in a set grid size.   In
simple terms,  all that happens is that an invisible grid of  dots  is
overlaid on your image.  You can only draw on these dots,  so  if  you
were drawing lots of squares of a certain size, this would be of great
help.

You  right click on the tool,  and you can set the size of  the  grid,
which  is  the  distance between the dots,  or pixels.  You  can  also
change the offset which allows you to fine tune your grid and position
it anywhere on the X and Y Axis.

@node tool15 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Define Brush Tool."

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/15.Brush" 0}

This is another well used tool,  which enables you to create your  own
user definable brushes.

To  use you click on the box with the left button.  It should  have  a
"square  with no sides on it" highlighted.  It looks like a  box  with
just  corners on it.  If you click on it again you will  be  shown  "a
round shape, but not a circle". I will deal with each one separately.

The  box  icon allows you to grab parts of your image,   but  makes  a
rectangular brush.

The  circular one allows you to grab parts of your image which are  of
an irregular shape.

First  I  will deal with the box.  When you click on it and return  to
the image screen,  a set of crosshairs appear. You click on one corner
of the desired area,  and drag until you reach the opposite corner, ie
start  at top left,  and finish at bottom right.  Everything you  want
will now be in a box. Release the button, and you have your brush.

With  the circular brush,  all you do is click on it,  return  to  the
image,  and draw a line around the part you want,  and finish the line
back at the start. Your irregular shape is now a brush.

IMPORTANT - If you go to the image screen and draw around  your  shape
with  the  left  button,  a copy of the area will be made,   and  your
original image will be unharmed.  If you use the right button to  grab
your image, the place where your brush was taken from will be replaced
by the background colour, and any detail that was there before will be
erased, or painted over with the background colour.

@node tool16 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Magnify Tool"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/16.Brush" 0}

This  is a magnifying glass style tool,  which enables you to  view  a
selected area of your image,  in a more detailed state, which can even
go down to pixel by pixel.

To use, click on the tool with the left button, and use the crosshairs
to  select your area,  starting at one corner,  and finishing  at  the
opposite corner (top left - bottom right for example).  When  you  let
the button go,  the screen splits into two halves,  with the magnifyed
area on the left, and the rest of the normal image on the right.

There  are  two  normal scroll gadgets on the magnify  window,   which
allow you to scroll up and down, left and right.

To  allow  you  to  edit the magnified image even  further,   you  can
separate it to a pixel by pixel image.  To do this,  click on the  box
on  the bottom right hand side of the magnified image.  A grid is then
overlaid onto the magnified image, allowing you to select one pixel at
a  time.   If  the screen flashes when you select this  tool,   it  is
possible  that you do not have enough memory to enable  this  tool  to
function,  as a high resolution magnified image like this takes  up  a
lot of memory and processor time.

This  is used in conjunction with the Magnify tool.  Once you  are  in
Magnify mode, click on the left button to zoom in on your chosen area,
and the right to move out.

If  you have two environments selected,  you can have a different zoom
level on each one,  so one can be fully zoomed in,  while the other is

@node tool18 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Clear (Wastebasket) Tool"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/18.Brush" 0}

This tool is used to clear the screen,  and start afresh.  By clicking
on the undo button,  it is possible to reclaim the image,  although if
you click on the clear tool twice,  then the Undo buffer will also  be
cleared,  so be careful when using this tool.  Basically all the  tool
does is paint over the image with the current background colour,  thus
clearing the screen.

@node tool19 "Personal Paint Tutorial - The Undo / Redo Tool"

@{"Click for a picture of the Icon" system "C:vt Pics/19.Brush" 0}

This tool is used to undo any mistakes,  or functions that you did not
wish  to perform.  It can be very handy when you have drawn an  image,
and  wish to change a few of the colours.  If,  after the fifth colour
change  for  example,  you are not happy and wish to  return  to  your
original image, you can keep clicking on the tool with the left button
until  the  original  is back.  If,  when you  have  returned  to  the
original  image,  and thought that the third colour change really  was
quite  good,  you can click on the tool with the right button to  redo
changes, until the desired effect is reached.

By  clicking on the clear tool twice,  you will clear the undo /  redo
buffer which means that any changes will not be remembered.

If the buffer is empty, then the tool will be shaded.

@node pulldown "Sorry - This part of the guide will be available soon"

I am sorry, but we (Mark & I) decided it would be better if this guide
was split up into sections, so this section of the guide will be
released at a later date, although it has been written already.

See the next issue of Doubleclick, which will have this section.
