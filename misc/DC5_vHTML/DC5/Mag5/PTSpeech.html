Here  is what Petro Tyschtschencko, Managing Director of Amiga International had
to  say  during  his  recent presentation to the Amiga Atlanta, Inc.  User Group
(AAi).

Ladies  and  gentlemen,  thank  you  very  much for this kind invitation here to
Atlanta.  Thank you very much for the invitation.

This  is  my  first event here in the United States, and I'm really impressed to
see all these activities around our Amiga.  When I arrived yesterday midnight, I
could already feel the warm hospitality.
It  is nice to see that our Amiga platform is gifted by a community of competent
people.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is no longer a secret that we have got a friend in
business --  Gateway 2000, the new home for our Amiga.

Before  I  continue,  first  of  all  I  would  like  to  say thank you for your
understanding, for your patience, that you, my friends, have kept Amiga alive.

It is your success that our wonderful technology, our Amiga, has survived.  With
Gateway 2000, we all, and Amiga, I believe, will have a great and bright future.
Gateway 2000 is a well-known, solid and established company in a computer world.
Gateway  2000 is a leading global marketer of personal computers.  Ted Wait, the
chairman  and  CEO,  founded  Gateway  2000  in September, 1985.  The company is
located  in  North  Sioux  City,  South  Dakota and Gateway 2000 became a public
company  in 1993.  Today, Gateway 2000 sells more PCs, compatible systems in the
U.S.,  through  direct  marketing,  than  any other company.  Gateway 2000 has a
vision:   to  be  the  leading  marketer  of personal computers, products in the
world, and Amiga is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gateway 2000.

Gateway's  mission is to grow the business faster than the competition by better
understanding  and  serving  the  desires  of  the  customer.   And,  ladies and
gentlemen, Amiga is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gateway 2000.

Gateway  2000's  values  are  respect,  teamwork,  common  sense, effectiveness,
aggressiveness,  honesty  and,  of  course,  fun.   And  Amiga is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Gateway 2000.


Should I say more?

You  would  like  to hear some facts about revenue?  No problem.  Revenue up 37%
from 1995.  1.9 million Gateway PCs shipped in 1996.  Shipments up 43% from `95.
Earnings  up  47%  from `95.  International revenue up 69.5%.  I believe, ladies
and  gentlemen,  there's  a  bright  future for Amiga, for our community and for
Amiga International.

As I mentioned already in London, the basis of my strategy is 3 elements:

Supporting  the  existing  Amiga community.  How?  That's why I'm here.  Through
conventions,  through  press conferences, and the Internet (watch www.Amiga.de),
meetings, of course, and useful initiatives coming from the Amiga community.

Second,  leveraging  the existing Amiga technology through broad licensing.  The
basic  of  success in this project is to work together with partners to define a
common path of development.

The  Amiga market cannot afford to split; we must go together.  Together, in one
direction.   For  us  to  keep  the  market alive it is necessary to assist many
companies  in  developing  products.   Products  through  broad  licensing.  Our
licensing  policy  will  be  very open, broad, and of course, simple.  Licensing
will  be  focused  on  standards,  Amiga OS, chip sets, trademarks, boards, etc.
Whatever you would like.

The third basic element of the strategy is assisting in developing new products,
based on open standards, through the home computer and video market.
 It is very important that we explore an open Amiga platform and use industry
standard components.  That would make our products cheaper to produce, faster
to develop, and easier to upgrade.

At  this  time,  we are identifying candidates to manage the R&D department.  Be
sure,  we  will  explore  the most efficient method of determining R&D.  Amiga's
intention  is  to support the development community through concepts such as the
open  Amiga  initiative.   We will explore other concepts to bring developers on
the  platform.   We  will  explore the development of an Amiga OS upgrade and we
will  address  the  features  and  functions  that  are  necessary.   You can be
absolutely  sure  that  Gateway  2000 will provide resources to reinvigorate the
Amiga marketplace and keep Amiga a profitable subsidiary.

Long live our Amiga and our strong community.

Thank you very much.
