<P>The Amiga team attempting to crack the RC5 encryption scheme has now entered the top ten, out of over 4000 teams.

<P>They were at position 149 when announced in the Amiga magazines a month earlier, but the response from this coverage has pushed them right up.

<P>Anyone can join the Amiga team if they have a computer with an 
internet connection. A program which uses idle CPU time checks combinations and sends them over the internet.

<P>So the Amiga is dead? Can dead things decode public key encrypted messages?
