Cyclists  could  soon  be forced to fit bells to  their  pedal  bikes,
under  a  proposed new Government legislation.  Labour's  Road  Safety
Minister,  Lady Hayman,  claimed she wants to make the bells on cycles
a  compulsory item to help protect pedestrians.  This has been classed
as  "A  matter of priority",  although a Conservative Party  spokesman
has dismissed the idea as ludicrous.

More  people miss their cars more than their partners,   it  has  been
claimed.   The  survey,   commisioned by Green  Flag,   the  breakdown
recovery company,  state that over half of the drivers questioned said
they could not be without their car for more than a day.  Only 10  per
cent said the couldn't do without their husband or wife.

Theives  have  stolen  two  high powered rally  cars  from  the  World
champiuonship team Subaru.  The two Imprezas were stolen after a  Land
Rover Discovery was used to smash through the gates at the Oxfordshire
plant, which was then dumped, and the two cars taken away.

Over  100,000  drivers who were breath tested last year,   failed  the
test.  Poilce carried out the highest ever number of tests in  1996  -
781,000 of them.

A car has been built for the man who has everything, including a price
on  his  head,   by  a British Security firm and Toyota.   The  Toyota
Landcruiser  Amazon looks externaly just like the normal  £36,000  off
roader, but in reality it is a vehicle designed for transporting VIP's
who  are  the  target of terrorists.  The £160,000  armoured  car  has
controls on the dashboard, marked 'Arm' and 'Fire', which controls the
smoke grenades, while Security specialists Scott Broder, has installed
transparent armour plating instead of glass.  The chassis of  the  car
is made from blast resistant metal, and the super reinforced fuel tank
can withstand a 10KG Semtek explosion at 3.5 metres.  In case of a gas
attack, the vehicle also has it's own air supply.

Millionaire Hugh Edeleanu is driving from John 'O Groats to Land's End
and  trying  to  break his own speed record,  in his Turbocharged  JCB
Digger.   The  current record is 34 Hours and 15 minutes.   Hugh  will
drive  the Landshuttle digger the 963 miles non stop,  except he  will
stop only for refuelling.

An AA report has revealed that if you want to avoid a car crash,  stay
off  of  the  roads  on a Friday.  That's when the average  number  of
crashes  soars  to 1,195 and when over 18 per cent  of  accidents  and
breakdowns happen. The safest day to travel is Sunday.

Italian car maker Alfa Romeo has been forced to recall more than 1,000
cars  because  there are fears that the drivers air bag  could  deploy
accidentally.  All of the new 1.6 and 1.8 and many 2 litre  models  of
its  145 and 146 series are to be recalled,  which is 1,302 in the  UK
alone.   The airbag could explode if the underside of the car  is  hit
hard, as there has been one case already.

Do  you  fancy owning a Ferrari for a week,  or a Porsche for a month,
or  even a Vauxhall Tigra for life? Avis,  the car rental company,  is
running  a competition that allows just that.  Everybody who  hires  a
car from them., and is over 30, will automatically be entered into the
competition.

In  a  desparate bid to cut down on 40,000 deaths every year,  US road
safety  groups want a legislation that forces parents to put  children
under 13 in the back seat.

In  the  US,  high speed police car chases could soon case to  happen.
There  is  uproar over them as an average of 300 people are killed  in
the US as a result of these chases.

The Maricopa Indians,  a tribe in Arizona,  USA,  have objected  to  a
highway  which crosses their land,  being named after movie star  John
Wayne.   The  indians are upset because they disagree  about  the  way
their ancestors were portrayed in his films.

A  road  in  Shipton,   Shropshire was closed  recently  after  a  car
accident.  A van was buried when a lorry overturned in  front  of  it,
and  shed  its  load  of  potatoes.  The lorry collided  with  a  car,
overturned and shed its load over the Escort van was engulfed  in  the
landslide.  It`s female driver was injured and taken to hospital.  The
other drivers in the incident were also slightly hurt.

Jaguar  has  ceased production of its legendary V12 5.3  litre  engine
after  26  years.   The  original unit was  launched  with  272  Brake
horsepower (BHP)  in the E-Type in 1971.  Today, their next generation
4 litre V8 engimne, as used in the new XK8 coupe, has more power - 290
BHP and it also has better economy.

To try and sell more models, Ford has now introduced leather interiors
in  all  Scorpios as standard,  in an attempt to make the slow selling
model more appealing.

The  Jaguar  XK8 has broken all records with the company by outselling
any  other  sports  car in the campany`s history.   5,500  coupes  and
convertibles have been sold in the first four months of 1997.  Half of
these vehicles were sold in America,  and about a quarter of them were
sold in the UK.

Volvo, who have at last got rid of their staunchy, box car like image,
will  be  releasing high performance versions of  their  S40  and  V40
saloon  and  estate models in the autumn.  The 150  mph  T4  versions,
which  have a 1.9 litre turbocharged engine,  which produces 200  BHP,
will  do 0-60 mph in just about seven seconds.  Prices for thre  range
will start from just under #20,000.

Jeep,  the US manufacturer,  is recalling every right hand drive model
sold  in  the  UK  since their launch in January  1993.   There  is  a
possible weakness in the steering box mountings which must be  checked
by  supplying dealers.  This affects 19,000 vehicles,   but  the  1997
Cherokee,  which is on sale now, is not affected by the recall, as the
possible fault has been rectified.

An American driver,  Archie A Arnold,  recently died.  Before he died,
however,   hewanted to have a little fun,  so he told his friends  and
relatives of his wishes.  When he died,  he wanted two parking  meters
erected on his grave,  as he hated them and the meter maids  so  much.
They duly granted his request, and set them permanently to expired!

In  the USA,  Peter Nunn`s petrol station has bebbed 171 times in four
years.  Peter, from New York, says that he has given up trying to call
the  police  each  time he is robbed,  as he is too embarrassed.   His
phone has also been stolen!

The little known supercar from Nissan, the Skyline GT-R, is finally to
be  released in the UK.  The £50,000 supercar,  which has a 2.6 litre,
24 valve engine and is blisteringly quick, capable of warp speed, will
be  released after the London Motor Show in October.  Potential owners
will  have to be quick,  as only 100 will be available in the UK.   It
features include four wheel drive, electronic rear wheel steering, and
it  has  been called "one of the great driving experiences" by Nissan.
It  also  holds the record for being the only production car  to  have
lapped the notorious German F1 track,  the 14 mile Nurburgring in less
than eight minutes.

Sybil Mollard received a letter from the LA motor licensing agency  in
the USA recently.  It read "We have received a report that you may  be
deceased.   Please  come into our office with proof  of  identity  and
evidence that you are not dead.".

Saab,  the Swedish car maker, is recalling every car in its 900 series
as  there  are  fears that the throttle may stick.   The  recall  will
probably  affect 20,000 cars in the UK,  leading to 170,000 worldwide.
Saab  stress that no accidents have occured,  although 10  cases  were
received  in  America.   The official word  is  that  a  build  up  of
corrosion  on  the  throttle   housing   could   lead  to  "unintended
acceleration."   Defective   parts   will   be   replaced  with  brass
components,   which  are non corrosive.  This ironically  comes  after
their  recent newspaper advertising campaign in which the 900 set  the
world  endurance  record by driving 25,000 at  140  mph.   The  advert
stated "You'll never need to do it - but it's nice to know you can.".

A  car  which hit the back of Fritz Hoffmann's car in Berlin,  Germany
turned  out  to be the one he had sold a year earlier  -  he  sold  it
because he thought it was jinxed!

Polite  billboards in Maryland,  USA that said "Welcome to Maryland  -
please  drive  gently.",   and "Leaving Maryland  -  we  enjoyed  your
company."  have  been  joined by "Just what you  dread  -  Road  Works
ahead."

Meanwhile, holiday traffic jams in Maryland are being eased by a group
of  state employees which helps motorists who have broken down or been
involved in minor accidents.  Patrol members do not compete  with  the
American AA mechanics, but they do carry supplies of water and petrol.
In  Poland,   car  theives  who stole Warsaw  bishop  Herbert  Luthe's
Mercedes,   returned  it  a day later.  It  had  since  been  cleaned,
polished, and had a full tank of petrol.

Aston  Martin  is  joining  forces with the  great  motorsport  engine
builder  Cosworth Engineering,  who were behind a series  of  motorway
storming Ford models.  Aston, who is now owned by Ford, called them in
to  tweak  the engines in the Volante,  Vantage and the V8 Coupe.   As
well as this,  the DB7,  their most advanced model, will get a rethink
over the next two years,  which also includes the mind blowing 400 bhp
plus GT model.

The number of deaths on US roads has fallen - even though speed limits
were  raised two years ago.  Most states now have a limit of  65  mph,
which was previously 55 mph, and Montana does not have a speed limit.

Squeegee  bandits may be very annoying on the streets  but  they  have
gained  recognition  in  print.  The roadside windscreen  washers  are
included in the latest edition of the Oxford Dictionary.  Car-jackers,
hotters and rollerbladers have also made it in for the first time.

A  Tory  MP  who backed a "Kill Your Speed" campaign has  been  caught
driving at nearly twice the speed limit.  David Ruffley,  MP for  Bury
St Edmonds, was fined £550 for doing 55 mph in a 30 mph zone.

The  Vauxhall  Vectra  is the cheapest car in  its  class  to  repair,
according  to  statistics on the cost of repairing real  life  prangs.
The  figures  were  compiled by fleet car accident management  company
Velo  using data from 30,000 company car accidents over  the  last  12
months.

Vauxhall dealers are giving away a book that shows how to adjust  your
driving  seat  to avoid back problems.  Nearly two thirds  of  drivers
covering  more than 10,000 miles a year are said to have back  trouble
aggravated by the wrong seating position.

Renault has sold one million Twingos in the four years since  the  car
was  launched.  The 1,000,000th car rolled off the production line  at
Filns  in  France and was presented to French Lottery  winnner  Gilles
Rouzauld,   who works at the plant.  The car is also built  in  Spain,
Taiwan and Columbia.

The car industry is attacking a government proposal to allow people to
disconnect their airbags.  It is claimed the move,  prompted by a rash
of child fatalities caused by air bags, will cause 400 deaths a year.

The  US  Army is trying to reappropriate a Sherman Tank from a citizen

Manufactured  by  Hagenuk,  the phone was officialy  launched  at  the
Frankfurt Motor Show.

Land  Rover  has  extended  the  chassis  repair  programme  from  the
Defender  to cover the Discovery and Range Rover Classic models.   The
scheme  allows  owners to replace sections of a  damaged  chassis  and
avoid  risking a write off,  as where before,  you were only  able  to
purchase a full chassis section.

required to pass a driving test, according to Specsavers opticians.

Canadian accessory manufacturer On Track (001 604 538 7362)  claims to
have  solved  the problems associated with Gatso proof number  plates.
Instead  of  replacing  the  plate,  On  Track  supplies  a  strip  of
reflective plastic which covers the original,  making it  opaque  from
the roadside but still readable from directly behind the car.

The  US  Govcernment is investigationg complaints that the  straps  of
built  in  child  seats on Chrysler's popular  Voyager  MPV  can  trap
children.  Chrysler has issued a video with guidance on the proper use
of the seats, which are not yet available in the UK.

British  cars have topped the first ever government approved  security
league  table.  The Jaguar XK8 and Range Rover 4.0 litre SE share  the
top  spot  in  the  72 car ranking conducted by What Car?  using  test
procedures  approved by the Home Office.  At  the  other  end  of  the
scale,  the Renault Clio and 1997 model VW Polo took joint last place,
although VW has since improved the locks on it's 1998 model.   VW  and
Renault are not alone in performing below par.  Of the 72 cars tested,
What  Car?  found  that 64 would fail to meet Home  Office  guidelines
stating  that locks must withstand attack by a thief for at least  two
minutes.  Full results of the test can be found in the September issue
of What Car?

Although  the BMW Z3 2.8 is now offially on sale for £28,115,   buyers
who place their order now will have to wait until March for delivery.

Ferrari  made  its  last  F50 on 30 July.   Destined  for  an  Italian
customer,  the barchetta red car was signed off and its numbered badge
attached  by  Ferrari  President Luca  di  Montezemolo  at  a  special
ceremony  attended by the F50 assembly workers.  Despite  making  only
349  cars,   Ferrari  estimates  it  could  have  sold  450  F50's  to
legitimate buyers.

The  Metropolitan police is reconsidering its decision to scrap  black
box recorders in police cars after the success of a similar scheme  in
Berlin.  Senior officers are said to be stunned by the results of  the
Berlin  pilot  scheme,    where   accident   levels   have  fallen  so
significally that the project has been widened to include most of  the
vehicle  fleet.  Accident recorders were removed from  Londons  police
cars 18 months agao,  despite strong evidence that their presence  was
also  responsible for a dramatic reduction in accidents.  Reasons  for
the decison were never made public,  but lack of funds and interest at
the highest levels were thought to have played a part.

Home  Office statistics have revealed that British motorists are  more
likely  to  be  victims of car crime than those of any other  European
country.

With one in ten motorway deaths occuring on the hard shoulder,  the AA
is  advising  motorists to ensure that they get out of their  car  and
sit on the verge while waiting for assistance.

A European directive banning the sale of leaded petrol from 2000 could
spell  disaster for up to 250,000 motorists.  The directive was signed
by  the EC environmental council in June and will be ratified  by  the
European  Parliament iun the autumn in a process which inside  sources
have  descibed as a "formality".  Although Greece,  Spain and Portugal
have  been  exempted  from  the ban until 2005,   the  Government  has
accepted  the plans in an attempt to reduce pollution  levels.   As  a
result,   leaded fuel will be banned in the UK from  January  1  2000,
although  classic and sports car enthusiasts will supposedly  be  able
to  purchase  four  star  through   a  handful  of  specialist  petrol
stations.   The  remaining  250,000 motorists  whose  cars  cannot  be
converted  to  run on unleaded fuel will be forced  to  fill  up  with
unleaded and add cartridges containing lead replacment additives.

Racing  Driver Emerson Fittipaldi is launching his own line of cigars.
The smokes will be marketed from a store in his home town of Miamai.

0181 313 3030.

Boffins  are  testing  a  wobbly   speed  hump  which  jolts  speeding
vehicles,  but is soft on slower vehicles. The hump is a liquid filled
cushion  protected by a rubber mat.  Drive over it at  low  speed  and
you'll  be fine,  but between 20 and 30 mph,  the soft centre  becomes
rigid.   It's  currently undergoing testing at the Transport  Research
Laboratory in Berkshire.

In  Malaysia,   drivers  convicted of holding  a  mobile  phone  while
driving  will  be banned for six months under new laws.   Lsast  year,
180,000 motorists were caught making calls on the move.

Meanwhile  in  the UK,  thousands of motorists could soon  face  being
stopped  and  fined for using a mobile phone while driving.   Although
the  Government has rejected calls to ban the use of  mobiles  on  the
move,   the  Home  Office wants police to follow the  example  of  the
Gloucestershire force and pull drivers over.  In a two hour trial last
June,   it  stopped  15  people  for  driving  without  due  care  and
attention,  and nine were using mobile phones. Six were fined £20. "We
were  looking for people not in proper control of a vehicle," said  PC
Gary  Shellard.  "It was a rainy day and the potential  for  accidents
was  huge." Although safety groups have been calling for a  ban,   the
Government says existing legislation gives the police enough power. "A
£20  fine  is  a  lot to pay every time you use your phone,"  said  PC
Shellard,   "but it would be easier if it was an offence  in  its  own
right.".

Three  teenagers  have  each been given 15  year  jail  sentences  for
stealing  road  signs in the USA.  The youths  were  found  guilty  of

A  mechanic has been banned from driving - for the 63rd time!   Edmund
Flahive,   38,   of  Leicestershire,  who lives yards  from  a  police
station, was also jailed for the 19th time for breaking bans.

Eastern European countries are seeing red as worn out Royal Mail  vans
take to their roads.  The bright red LDV 400's are being snapped up in
countries such as Poland and Latvia,  thanks to a £200 left hand drive
conversion kit.  A Royal Mail spokeswoman said "The LDV 400 is easy to
convert,  and has a trusty Peugeot engine.  Most of the vans are  four
years old with 80,000 miles on the clock,  but some have covered  more
than 140,000 miles.  They are great workhorses.".  (Not to mention the
fastest things on the roads!).

Cows  on  the  island of Pulau Langkawi,  Malaysia,  have  been  given
plastic  reflector earrings to make them more visible to motorists  at
night.  The earrings are similar to the red reflectors fitted  to  the
rear mudguards of bicycles.

Volkswagen  has  improved the security on its Polo hatch  (see  above)
with  new  door  and steering column locks.  The Polo now  shares  the
Passat's  "free  wheeling" ignition lock,  and the  steering  lock  is
almost impossible to overcome.

Social  worker  Mary  Murray,  visiting a Mexico City  prison,   asked
inmates  to help after she locked her keys inside the  car  -  so  one

Want  to know more about about wacky personalised number plates? Who's
Who On The Road, which is published in October, lists details of 6,000

in if they had an unusual plate - but the book doesn't reveal prices.

Lazy sales reps and car theives should all be worried by a new spy  in
the  sky  device  being secretly installed in cars  and  vans.   Fleet
managers using on-screen computer maps can locate a tagged vehicle  to
within  25  yards,  and precisely record its movements.  The  Trantrak
system  was  developed by Coventry based Technical  Telecommunications
International  to  improve efficiency of delivery  fleets.   Links  to
security systems permit tracking a stolen car.  The system also  means
no  rep can argue he's stuck in traffic if the computer shows his  car
is in the pub car park!

A  thief is in hospital after breaking into a shooting enthusiasts car
in  Texas,  USA.  He thought a metal box was full of money so  used  a
blow-torch to open it - but it contained 6lb of gunpowder.

Speeding motorists could soon find themselves being slowed down by  in
car computers that overide the driver and apply the brakes.  Trials of
roadside  beacons that send radio signals to the computers of  passing
cars,  telling them the speed limit,  are scheduled to start next year
on  the  M4.   If a car is going too fast,  the computer  applies  the
brakes  and the driver will find the throttle won't work if  he  tries
to speed up.

Police  patrol  cars in Scotland are being fitted  with  roof  mounted
electronic  emergency signals in five languages for  foreign  drivers.
The  18 messages,  displayed at the touch of a button,  include Follow
Me, Road Flooded, Accident and Do Not Overtake.

A  storm  has blown up over a new speed trap beating gadget  that  its
makers  say  is so good they'll refund speeding fines  if  it  doesn't
work.   The  pledge has brought a protest from police who  accuse  the
firm  of  inciting  drivers to break the law.  Northampton  based  TBS
Industries says its £299 Phazar is legal to use as it doesn't scan  or
jam  police signals but "soaks up" radar waves so signals can't bounce
off a car.  The Phazar,  originally designed to enable jet fighters to
outwit missiles,  is classed as a reflector,  not a transmitter,   and
thus  escapes the rules of The Wireless Telegraphy Act.  TBS  put  the
Phazar  on  sale  after  police traps on the A14  caught  40  speeding
motorists.  Inspector Hugh Jones of Northamptonshire Police commented:
"On the A14,  we have recorded cars travelling at speeds of up to  130
mph.  We want more legislation to help us, but in the meantime it's up
to  drivers and the companies who sell this type of device to  realise
what the consequences of excess speed can be - the death of someone.".

One of the worlds biggest computer chip manufacturers,  Intel, has set
up  an  in car computing division to put the power of a home PC  in  a
cars  dashboard.   The chips will be the brains  behind  the  vehicles
entertainment  centre,   and  allow  drivers  to  make  calls  or  fax
documents by voice recognition technology.

A  new non corrosive antifreeze has been developed by NASA.  The green

The  Army  is  set  to  sell off a fifth of its Land  Rover  fleet  by
Christmas.  The 4,000 Series III Land Rovers - some less than 15 years
old - are being sold through Midlands firm Military Vehicle Spares  at
an  old  air  base  near Lichfield,  even though the  new  Land  Rover
Defenders replacing them will not arrive for another two years.

A  drunk  driver in Bari,  Italy called police on his mobile phone  to

registration is among 20 R plates to be banned by the authority.

An  advert  showing  a Porsche driver crashing  his  car  after  being
distracted by a model has been slammed as tasteless.  With the  slogan
"Dress to kill",  the black and white ads for clothes tretailer Wallis
appeared  in  women's  glossy mags in September.   Other  ads  show  a
captivated train guard about to be decapitated by a tunnel wall,   and
a  man  about to drive a lawnmower over a sunbather.  But the campaign
has  caused  outrage.   "Death  is  not  a  funny  subject",   said  a
spokeswoman for the National Council of Women.

Police  are combining forces in an effort to combat a new outbreak  of
"bridge  bombing".   A joint operation between the  British  Transport
Police  and motorway cops is aimed at putting a stop to the so  called
bombers  who  hurl  potentially lethal missles from  bridges  spanning
major  roads  and  railway lines.  The move  comes  after  actor  Sean
Connery escaped injury when the Range Rover he was driving was hit  by
a  brick  thrown  from a road bridge near Chertsey,   Surrey.   Police
officers are convinced a hardcore of tearaways,  some as young as  12,
are behind the attacks.  The anti bombing campaign,  involving the BTP
and the Central Motorway Police Group responsible for the M5,  M42 and
M6  in  the  West Midlands,  begins this month.  Officers will  target
housing estates close to major road and rail links in a bid to  gather
information  and  make  youngsters aware  of  the  dangers  of  bridge
bombing.   Police  will  also be using more than  60  high  definition
