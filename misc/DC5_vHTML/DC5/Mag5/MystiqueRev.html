<P>This demo starts off with some 3D effects, but contains a lot of 2D effects too, which makes a change from those demos with nothing but 3D. You've seen one rotating 3D texture mapped blob, you've seen them all...

<P>There are two rotating tunnel sections, the first one is okay, 
but the later one has much better lighting on the walls; the colour makes all the difference, it seems.

<P>Plenty of 2D effects which are rather difficult to describe; wierd shapes spinning around and distorting.

<P>There's a nice section which show some water, with ripples and 
lighting/reflection, complete with seagull noises! Then you see a 3D dolphin swimming about.

<P>All in all, a good demo. Nothing individually makes it stand out, but all the bits together make a demo worth watching.
