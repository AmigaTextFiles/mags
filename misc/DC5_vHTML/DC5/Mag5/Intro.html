<P><B>Hello, and welcome to the fifth issue of DoubleClick!</B>

<P><A HREF="MovFace256Xmas.Anim"><B>A Christmas Pressy</B> from Stephen, in the form of an animation</A> - (<A HREF="conguides.html">Set up your browser to load IFF animations</A>, or load separately the file 'MovFace256Xmas.Anim' in the Mag5 drawer.

<P><B>Big</B> changes this issue in that we are now distributing only in pure HTML or AmigaGuide, that is, the HTML version requires you to have a Web Browser. Please read the relevant section...

<P><B>HTML Version</B> - Also known as the FULL version

<P>If this is the disk distributable (ie, you didn't download it from Aminet, or something), then there is a special Local-only version of AWeb 3; the system requirements are 2MB RAM, hard disk, OS3.0+, and Class Act (provided). Many thanks to Yvon Rozijn for giving us permission to distribute this version with the mag. Please note that this version of AWeb should only be used with DoubleClick, and not distributed separately!

<P>Of course, if you prefer Voyager or IBrowse, then fine, use them. I have provided AWeb because it doesn't use MUI and is low on system requirements, so should keep everyone happy (if you have less than AWeb's sys. requirements, then get the AmigaGuide version!) AWeb also loads IFFs (unlike Voyager), as well as being 
an excellent browser, anyway.

<P>If you download from aminet, then you will only get the HTML files - I presume you can download a Web Browser yourself.

<P>The biggest problem with HTML is playing mods - see the <A HREF="music.html">music page</A> for information on how to play mods via a Web Browser, because it is possible. Also, there are some Amigaguides which can be viewed from the browser <A HREF="conguides.html">if you configure it correctly</A>.

<P>Note that DoubleClick is completely Frames free.

<P><B>Amigaguide Version</B> - Also known as the LITE version

<P>This only requires OS2.0 or above (and possibly 1MB RAM?) and runs from floppy. There are limitations, partly due to the fact that the guide version is done by a program converting the files. For example, Tables come out rather wonky... Also, playing modules etc cannot be done (AFAIK - tell me if you know different),  but they are provided anyway.

<P>Note that although you can run from floppy, some files might not be accessable from the main guide (because they wouldn't fit on disk 1!), but they are if you install from hard disk.

<P><B>IMPORTANT!</B> The version which is on Aminet will require a hard disk to decompress to and run from. Get the 'disk distributable' version from us (Mark or Stephen), or maybe a PD library if you have no hard drive.

<H2>Support for Future Issues!</H2>

<P>What's in future issues of this Diskmag, and when they get released depends on <B>you</B>, the reader. The more letters, articles and so on that I receive, the sooner I can release the next issue, and the better it can be. Needless to say, this will be helped if more people see this mag, so please don't hesitate it to give it to your friends, send it to PD libraries, upload it to BBSs, etc. Remember: More support = More and Better Articles = Better Mag!
<HR>
<H2>How Can I Get Earlier Issues?</H2>

<P>These may be available from some PD libraries, but instead, you can get them from <A HREF="EditorMark.html">Mark</A> or <A HREF="EditorStephen.html">Stephen</A>. Cost is &#163;1 for issues  1 and 2, and &#163;1.20 for issue 3. Please specify what issue you want, and whether you want the Full or Lite version..

<P><H2><A HREF="Submiss.html">How to Submit Your Articles, etc!</A></H2>

<P>Read it, enjoy it, <B>and write some of your own articles! </B>Any help I receive will be greatly appreciated.
