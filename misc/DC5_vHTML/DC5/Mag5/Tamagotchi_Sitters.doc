The Story of Tamagotchi & The Babysitter

Long ago, there was a little creature called Tamagotchi, who came in a
box, with lots of his friends, from Japan.

Soon  after  they arrived in the UK,  the creatures all  split  up  to
explore  different parts of the country,  living in department  stores
and computer shops.

People,  who were attracted to them by their colourful coats  and  the
tendancy  to  always  wanting attention,   were  soon  adopting  these
colourful creatures into their own lives.

Humans then found their real mission in life - to take over the world.
No  matter how hard they tried,  they found it hard to put down  these
cute colourful creatures from the land of Sake and Karaoke.

These  creatures  had  a  great   trick  to  captivating  the  human's
attention.   If you did not devote your life to them,   and  be  their
slave,  they would die,  only to be reincarnated as themselves shortly
afterwards.  The humans,  who were by this time devoted  followers  of
this strange race of beings, were powerless against them.

Record  attempts were soon staged to see who could  look  after  their
creature  the  longest.  The record started,   of  course,   in  their
homeland,  when a boy managed to tend for one for an amazing  58  days
before  it  died of old age,  presumably (or until the  batteries  ran
out!).

All this will now change,  as two British companies have joined forces
to defeat this evil foe.

Priestman Goode & the Cambridge Design Partnership have come up with a
cunning plan.  They plan to make a "Robot babysitter" which will  tend
for the creature while you are away from it.

What you do is simple - place the creature in the babysitters arms and
play  with  it as normal,  pressing the buttons as you usually  would.
The  babysitter  will then learn how you tend the  creature  and  take
over,  usinng small motors to push the buttons on the creature,   when
you  are away.  There is also a microphone which will listen  for  the
creature  crying when it has not been tended for enough,  ensuring  24
hour nursing.

The  two companies are looking for somebody to manufacture the device,
which  they  plan  to  sell  to the Japanese  before  Christmas.   The
babysitter is multi talented as well,  as it can also look after other
virtual pets, and not just the ones from the Bandai family.

These virtual pets, or "Electronic Vermin" as they have been called in
some  circles,   were  banned  in   Singapore  schools  after  pupils'
schoolwork was suffering.  In Japan,  businessmen have been  known  to
employ "Tamagotchi sitters" to look after their pets while they work.
