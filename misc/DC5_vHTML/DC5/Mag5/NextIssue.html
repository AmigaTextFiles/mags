<P>Hmmm, no one took us up on the Issue 5 special offer ;(

<HR>
<P>Issue 6 will be springing up on an Aminet site near you (and elsewhere) sometime in 1998. We have no idea when it'll be finished, what it will contain, or even if it really will be finished before 1999. Do you think we plan these things?

<P>Anyway, there's plenty to read in this issue, so what are you doing staring at this page?
