<P>This  is  a questionnaire which we would <B>greatly</B>  appreciate
you  taking  the time to fill in.  You can either copy  it  onto  some
paper,   or  alternatively,  load this file into a text editor.   From
there,  enter the details,  and either save it to disk or print it out
(Note  that  the  questionnaire is free of HTML tags!)   The  file  in
question is 'Questionnaire.html'.

<P>I  know it is quite a long questionnaire,  so if you want to  leave
some bits blank for any reason,  then feel free. We will only be using
these  results  for our own purposes to produce  a  better  mag,   and
although  we will publish some results in future issues (providing  we
have  enough  replies!),  we won't mention anyody specifically,   just
give generalisations of the results. Now on with the questions...
