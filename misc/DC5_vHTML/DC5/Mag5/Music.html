<BR><B><A HREF="Plastic.mod">Plastic Engineering</B></A>

<P>Both are by Jonathan Bryant (XLR8), in 4 channel mode.

<P>If you are using the Amigaguide version, then you cannot play them, so don't click on this link!

<P>If this is the HTML version, you can play them, but only by configuring your Web Browser! Go to the settings for the different file types (eg, 'MIME' in Voyager), and add a new one for modules with extension '.mod'. Then set it up to 'Use External Application', and select your favourite module player!

<P>You may need to add some arguments, for example with OctaMEDPlayer, you need '%f WINDOW' (or '"%s" WINDOW' in AWeb) so it opens up a window on the workbench screen (in Voyager, the arguments are entered after the filename, in the same text gadget).

<P>Hope that works! If you can't get it working, then the modules 
are of course there to be listened to separately - and once you have done it, you won't need to do it again, assuming you save the settings.

<P>If there are any readers wishing to <A HREF="OtherSub.html">send in</A> a mod, then we'll be pleased to accept it. We'd like at least two mods for each issue.
