                     WITTICISMS OF 7 CONDEMNED CRIMINALS.

1.  GEORGE APPEL.  (Electrocuted in 1952.)

As  he  was being strapped into the electric chair Appel quipped -  "Well,
folks, you`ll soon see a baked Appel."


2.  GUY CLARK.  (Hanged in 1832.)

On  the  way to the gallows the sheriff asked Clark to speed up the  pace.
Clark replied, "Nothing will happen until I get there."


3.  JAMES DONALD FRENCH.  (Electrocuted in 1966.)

Turning to a newsman on his way to the chair,  French helpfully suggested.
"I have a terrific headline for you in the morning - French Fries!"


4.  WILLIAM PALMER.  (Hanged in 1856.)

As  he  stepped  onto  the  gallows Palmer  looked  at  the  trapdoor  and
exclaimed, "Are you sure it`s safe?"


5.  SIR WALTER RALEIGH.  (Beheaded in 1618.)

Feeling  the edge of the axe soon to be used on him,  Raleigh said,   "Tis
asharp remedy but a sure one for all ills."


6.  JAMES W RODGERS.  (Shot in 1960.)

Asked if he had a last request,  Rodgers stated,  "Why yes - a bulletproof
vest."


7.  FREDERICK CHARLES WOOD  (Electrocuted in 1963.)
 
Sitting down in the electric chair Woods said,  "Gentlemen,  you are about
to see the effect of electricity upon Wood."
