<P>Following on from the Amigo tower kits, Intrinsic Computer Systems are to 
release a range of Amiga A1200T clones based on the Amigo.

<P>The Amigo PC (as it will be called) will appear in various configurations:<UL>
<LI><B>Storm A1200</B> - basic A1200T
<LI><B>Cyclone A1200</B> - A1200T with 50MHz 68030
<LI><B>Tornado A1200</B> - A1200T with 50MHz 68060
<LI><B>Hurricane A1200</B> - A1200T with 200MHz PPC603e
</UL>
<P>All will come with a choice of 16 or 32MBs RAM, and options such as hard drive, CD ROM, etc.

<P>An example specification of the Hurricane is given as:<UL>
<LI>Hurricane HC A1200 Tower,
<LI>200MHz 603e,
<LI>34MB System RAM,
<LI>2GB Hard drive,
<LI>16x CD ROM,
<LI>Graphics card,
<LI>Monitor.
<LI>All for &#163;1699.95
</UL>

<P>This could be the first Amiga to actually be sold with PPC processor as standard, and it would certainly be the most high-powered. Admittedly the value is not as good as PCs, but it easily competes with PowerMacs, and is far better that what the Amiga's had previously.

<P>For anyone complaining that these Amigas aren't really 'new', being just A1200 Tower clones will be pleased to know the new Amigas have been released by DCE / Power Computing under an official licence. Details are few at the moment, but there will be to models, one with 50MHz 68030, and one with a 50MHz 68060. They will be upgradable to PowerPC, and come in nice normal size tower cases (unlike the A1200 board which requires a really tall one...) Prices have not been announced, hopefully they will be good.

<P>Also, the Access machine from Index is now available.

<P>(This New Amiga Clones section could become a regular feature in DC... I hope so!)
