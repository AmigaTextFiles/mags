Golden Wonder Wonders!

Being an avid consumer of Golden Wonder crisps, I thought it may be
fun and interesting to print out the Trivia questions that they print
on the back of the packets.  Then again, maybe it would not be
interesting.  Either read it or don't.

   not clear.

Q: What do the letter S.O.S. stand for?

Q: Why is the term 'try' used to descibe a touchdown in rugby?
A: Under early rules, points were scored only at kicks at goal, and to
   qualify for a kick the player had to cross the goal line with the
   ball and touch it down.  Supporters would then shout 'a try' - 
   meaning that their team should now attempt to kick at goal.

Q: What was it that Health Minister, Enoch Powell, did in 1962 which
   caused uproar in the House of Commons?
A: An opposition spokesman claimed that he had been involved in
   'activities unbecoming a Greek scholar and gentleman' - he had been
   spotted bouncing around on a pogo stick in Eaton Square, London.
