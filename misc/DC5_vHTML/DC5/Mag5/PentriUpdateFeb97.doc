PentriNews Four, February '97...

Well, it seems a while since the last PentriNews... I must have forgotten 
about it.

As I write, DoubleClick Issue 3 has been completed; I'm just making minor 
changes, etc, before I put it onto disks. I am pleased that I am receiving a
steadily growing number of contributions, as you can see from this issue, 
but I need MORE! So members / non-members alike, get typing!

There have been a few more members, but it has been ages since a reader ad 
in Amiga Shopper. Amiga Format have announced an 'Amiga Angels' / 'We Can 
Help You' project, where by individuals or clubs can write in about 
themselves, who are willing to help others. I have of course written in on 
behalf of PentriSoft (with a little persuasion from Stephen), so maybe 
something will come of that.

In the meantime, as always, just write and tell me if you want to 
hear from other members, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have told some of you about an idea of a 'members only sort of PD 
library'. Some of us have reasonable/large PD collections, whether on CD ROM
or disks; basically, there would be a list of members willing to take part
with the PD they own, so if a member wanted some PD, they could get it more 
cheaply than from a commercial PD library (though they would still supply 
disks/postage, of course). Such a service would be members only, for various reasons.

Another, slightly related idea (suggested by Garfield) is to set up a 
collection of programs which members have written. I don't know about 
keeping the programs in one place, but certainly, I want to produce a list 
(ie, ASCII/AmigaGuide, etc) of members' programs, so please write in with a 
list of your programs - remember to give brief details, system requirements,
whether it is freeware, shareware, whatever, and where to get hold of it
(eg, you, PD libraries, Aminet, etc). And if from you, how much you are 
charging for it.

Such a list could be advertised in DoubleClick!, and of course all of 
members' own programs (ie, for free), so you have nothing to lose! Oh yes, 
this again is for members only, so if any non-members are reading this, join 
before you try ;)

That's about all for now. Send any suggestions, ideas, etc about PentriSoft 
to the usual address..
