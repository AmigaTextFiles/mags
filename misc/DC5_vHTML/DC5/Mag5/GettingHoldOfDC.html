<HTML><H2><B>Getting Hold of DoubleClick!</B></H2>

<P>DoubleClick is available from various sources now...

<UL>
<LI><B>Aminet</B> - both html and amigaguide versions will be uploaded to docs/mags as soon as possible, <B>under the name 'DCx_Guide.lha' and 'DCx_HTML.lha', where x is the issue number</B>, so check those recent lists! The html versions will from now on need a web browser (but 
just download a freeware one). Also, the amigaguide version on aminet requires you to decompress onto hard disk; if you only have a floppy drive, then get the disk version.
<LI><A HREF="Subs.html"><B>Subscription</B></A> - the best way for readers without internet access. Again, from now on the full/html version really requires a web browser, but there's also 
the guide version needing just WB2.
<LI><B><A HREF="TI_BBS.html">Transmission Impossible BBS</A></B> - DMS files of both versions will be available here!
<LI><B>CD ROM</B> - It ought to find its way onto the Aminet CDs of course, and we may send them in for AF/CU CoverCDs, but this takes time, and the issues will be out of date by a few months at 
least.
<LI><B>PD Libraries</B> - of course may get hold of it. In particular, Stephen will probably send copies to <B>Amicom PD</B>.
<LI><B>Other People</B> - Remember that DC is completely freeware, so feel free to copy it to all your contacts, and spread it everywhere!
