<HTML><H2><B>Phong Shading</B></H2>

<P>This tutorial shows how to do some very basic (and slow) Phong 
Shading. Source code is provided in AMOS, under the PhongShading.AMOS file in the Mag5/ drawer. I won't, however, be covering the source code closely, rather, I will be covering the theory of it here. A knowledge of vectors is useful, but if you don't understand it, you can still fiddle with the source code.

<P>Phong Shading is a simple method of applying lighting effects to 3D objects. The algorithm takes into account a single point light source, but no reflections of light from other objects. The light at a given point on the object is calculated as a combination of three parts:<UL>
<LI>Diffuse,
<LI>Ambient,
<LI>Specular</UL>

<P><B>Diffuse</B> is given by: Diffuse = I * KD * cos a
<BR>where I is the light intensity, KD is a coefficient (constant), and a is the angle between the surface normal and the light direction - normal means a line perpendicular to the surface. In vector notation, this becomes: Diffuse = I * KD * (<B>L . N</B>)
<BR>where <B>L</B> is a unit vector in the direction of the light beam, and <B>N</B> is a unit surface normal.

<P><B>Ambient</B> is easy, it's always a constant value: Ambient = IAKA

<P><B>Specular</B> is given by: Specular = I * KS * (cos b)^n
<BR>where KS is another constant coefficient. b is the angle between the viewing direction and the surface normal. In vector notation, with <B>R</B> equal to a unit vector in the viewing direction, we have: Diffuse = I * KS * (<B>R . V</B>)^n
<BR>n is how rough the surface is; a perfect mirror would have n=infinity. For the specular is a measure of how much light is reflected towards the viewpoint.

<P>Adding these three gives a brightness value, which can be used to determine the colour (not so easy when we aren't working in 24 bit!)

<P>The two programs are more or less the same; they both draw a 3D sphere, with a fixed viewpoint.
