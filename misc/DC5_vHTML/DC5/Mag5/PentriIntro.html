<H2><B>About PentriSoft</B></H2>
<P><B>History</B>

<P>PentriSoft was originally set up as an association of programmers on the Macintosh, by a friend of mine (Steph Gray). This was done in 1995. During early 1996, I proceeded to do a similar thing for the Amiga. Please note that although the two sections of PentriSoft share the same name, logos, ideas and aims, etc, their operation is kept fairly separate!

<P>PentriSoft consists mainly of programmers, of many languages and levels of experience - we cater for all. I would however be pleased to hear from Amiga users who are not programmers, but may wish to get in contact with some. In particular, I would like to extend membership to:<UL>
<LI>Graphics artists,
<LI>Musicians,
<LI>Game designers, or anyone with an idea for a program,
<LI>Beta testers,
<LI>People who want to write articles for DoubleClick on a regular basis,
<LI>BBS Sysops, <A HREF="Distrib.html">especially those willing to put DoubleClick on their BBS</A>,
<LI>People with a lot of contacts wishing to distribute programs <A HREF="Distrib.html">(like DoubleClick, for example)</A>,
<LI>Anyone with PD software wishing to swap,
<LI>Editors of other e-zines?
<LI>and maybe others...?</UL>
<P>Please note that at the time of writing, we are mainly programmers, you can <A HREF="PentriMembers.html">see the current membership list</A> for yourself. This means that the advantages to others getting in contact are not as great, at the moment, but please don't let that put you off writing!

<P>Oh yes, membership is <B>free</B> of course. We believe that just by joining, you have as much to offer us as we have to offer you.

<P><B>What can PentriSoft offer?</B>
<BR><UL>
<LI>Contacts with other programmers to write to, exchange ideas, source code, maybe to write joint programs, and of course, to make new friends ;)
<LI>Contacts to write to for swapping PD; we may soon have a sort of members-only PD library, where we have a large list of PD where you can write to certain members if you need a particular program. There will be no cost (as long as you provide disks and postage!)
<LI>Beta testing of your programs by other members, to offer advice, suggestions, and point out bugs.
<LI>Soon, advertising of your programs in this e-zine, and other members' programs.
<LI>This e-zine, DoubleClick! Although if you <A HREF="Subs.html">subscribe</A>, you will get it as soon as it is complete, remember that it is freeware, so if I or another member is writing to you, we may send you the latest copy anyway.
<LI>This e-zine (again), in that you will have the opportunity to <A HREF="Submiss.html">submit</A> articles to it easily - of course, you <B>don't </B>have to be a member just to supply articles, etc!
<LI>The use of the PentriSoft name and logo in your programs to help us build a reputation (ie, a good one)!
</UL>
