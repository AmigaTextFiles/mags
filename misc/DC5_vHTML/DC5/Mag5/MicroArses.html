<HTML><H2><B>Microsoft Charity?</B></H2>

<P>Did anyone see on the news (BBC) on Monday 18th August about Microsoft employees?

<P>Basically, it was these people who had worked at Microsoft and made millions in a few years, and were now being really generous and setting up schemes to allow children to have access to technology, etc.

<P>Oh yes, aren't Microsoft just so wonderful?

<P>So, since it's the employees doing this off their own back, and not Microsoft as a company, presumably there must be other people who have worked for other companies (Motorola, Digital, and large PC companies). But if there were, we didn't here about them, not even a quick mention. It's like they don't exist.

<P>Well, I think it's a sad state of affairs that Microsoft has twisted things so that everyone believes it's them and only them who does everything; I don't mean so much domination of PCs, as there are plenty of other companies associated with it, more so the domination of Windows and everything MS associated.

<P>Oh well,
