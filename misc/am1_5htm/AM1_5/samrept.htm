<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's been a strange month since my last report.  The Emperor was
revealed to be naked.   The Minister of Propaganda was revealed to
be...a disappointment.  The Usenet became a bloody battlefield.
Carl resigned in disgust.  Bloomberg bloomed.  Alex angrily broke
his long silence.  And finally... the besieged Jason struck out
and quit the game.</P>
