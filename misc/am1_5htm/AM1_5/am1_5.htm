<BLOCKQUOTE>
"And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true..."

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>(a quote from the famous film, The Wizard of Oz...not the only reference you'll 
see to that movie in this issue)</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Greetings, and welcome to the December 1996 issue of The Amiga Monitor. We 
had some scheduling difficulties this month, and as a result, this issue is out a little later than we had 
hoped, and we were not able to include the "Amiga Benchmark Comparison" feature this month. My 
apologies for any inconvenience that causes.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On the other hand, we have been busily at work improving the magazine itself. 
Check out the "Mirror Sites" page (referenced above) to see several new additions. Music and MIDI 
Editor Fred Ericksen's monthly article is now an actual column (department), and there's a contest to 
come up with a name for it (see his column...and no, we <I>don't</I> have a new A4000 for the 
winner, Fred :)). Executive Editor Anthony Becker now has an established monthly column known as 
"The Tone Byte" full of short descriptions of various Amiga happenings and software here and there. 
And we'd like to welcome a new member to the staff: Bill Graham, a noted Amiga graphics artist, has 
joined us as Graphics Editor. His first article is very informative, and I look forward to him working with 
us in the future.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>And on the Amiga front...</B>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A number of things have happened in the Amiga community in the last month. 
Rather than explain them all here, I would refer you to the News and Editorial section below. 
However, I can say that no, nobody has bought the Amiga yet...and thus the delay continues. One 
can only hope that the situation will be brought to a successful resolution, and soon. Too bad the 
Amiga is going to miss yet another holiday season...</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On that note, I wish you all Happy Holidays and a prosperous New Year; and with 
that, we begin Volume 1 Issue 5 of The Amiga Monitor. And maybe...just maybe...something may 
finally have happened when we "meet" again, same time and same place, a month or so from 
now.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Only time will tell.</P>

<A HREF="events.htm">What on Earth is Going on Here?</A><BR>
<B><I>By Michael Webb</I></B><BR>
Depending on how you see it, it's been a whirlwind of a month; it's difficult to keep track of everything 
that has been happening lately, and easy to become disillusioned (rightly or wrongly) or misled, and if 
you blink, you might miss a lot. We attempt to clear some of that up here.

<BR><BR>

<A HREF="samrept.htm">The Sam Report: No Joy in Mudville</A><BR>
<B><I>By Sam Ormes</I></B><BR>
To those who have been cruising Amiga sections of the internet in the last month, a number of 
potentially significant events have occurred. Here, in summary.


<HR>


<CENTER><H3>FEATURES</H3></CENTER>

<A HREF="archie.htm">Archie</A><BR>
<B><I>By Danny Green</I></B><BR>
So far, we've covered a lot of information about where to go and what to do on the 'net, but it's easy 
to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of data out there. This month we take a look at a way to find 
the files you're looking for.

<BR><BR>

<A HREF="cdt.htm">Government Involvement in Internet/Data Encryption</A><BR>
<B><I>By Greg Noggle</I></B><BR>
There are many issues to consider when dealing with the internet these days, including international 
relations, laws regarding encryption, and your privacy.

<BR><BR>

<A HREF="gifanim.htm">Cross Platform Connectivity, or Don't Toss Your Amiga Just Yet</A><BR>
<B><I>By Bill Graham</I></B><BR>
PC's have become much more powerful in recent years while the Amiga more or less stagnated, but 
there are still some things that it can do very well. Our new Graphics Editor takes a look at different 
animation formats, specifically the world wide web standard Animated GIF, and how your Amiga and 
PC can work together to produce the best and most efficient results possible.

<CENTER><H3>REVIEWS</H3></CENTER>


<A HREF="disksalv.htm">DiskSalv Version 4</A><BR>
<B><I>By Michael Webb</I></B><BR>
We look into the latest version of this timeless disk repair and management program for the Amiga.

<BR><BR>

<A HREF="mindeye.htm">The mindEYE</A><BR>
<B><I>By Anthony Becker</I></B><BR>
A fascinating device that converts music and sounds into onscreen images, shapes, forms, and 
animations.


<HR>


<CENTER><H3>SPOTLIGHT ON GAMES AND ENTERTAINMENT</H3></CENTER>


<A HREF="mindwalk.htm">Amiga Gaming Retrospective: Part 5 - Mind Walker</A><BR>
<B><I>By Michael Webb</I></B><BR>
The Amiga Gaming Retrospective continues this month with a look back to 1986 when the Amiga 
was young, enthusiasm was high, and Amiga programmers went on flights of fancy that resulted in 
such timeless software as this, Commodore's only game for the Amiga.


<HR>

<A HREF="helpdesk.htm">Editors@HelpDesk</A><BR>

community, and life in general...also known as The Amiga Monitor's comic page.

<BR><BR>

<A HREF="midi.htm">The Amiga Monitor MIDI Room</A><BR>
<B><I>By Fred Ericksen</I></B><BR>
Fred the Amiga Music Man inaugurates his new department with more essential information for
