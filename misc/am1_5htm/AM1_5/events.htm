<H1>What on Earth is Going on Here?</H1>
<H4><I>A series of convoluted but telling events virtually akin to "AmiGate"...</I></H4>

<CENTER><H3>Is ignorance bliss?</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Generally, I would be inclined to say that "Knowledge is Power," but over the past 
month, the Amiga community has been witness to a number of events that could leave the most 
determined news-follower running for cover.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you're wondering if the Amiga has finally been acquired by some company, I 
regret to inform you that no, that is not the case, and if it were, it would be emblazoned in headlines 
across this entire issue.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Just when you thought that VIScorp was going to end up with the Amiga (and due 
to the way things were handled, I'm sure some of us thought it was already a done deal), some 
wrenches may have been thrown into the works. But if you listen to some of these wrenches, that 
may actually be a good thing...</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">See, I told you this was one big confused mess.</P>

<CENTER><H3>So what's the point?</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">To cut through the rhetoric and get to the point, first of all, Carl Sassenrath is no 
longer with VIScorp. For those who don't know, Sassenrath designed the Amiga's multitasking OS 
kernel, and joined VIScorp recently in order to add his wisdom and experience. He announced his 
resignation earlier this month with a rather violent posting on Usenet in which, shall we say, he did 
little to enhance the image of VIScorp in the Amiga community, calling it "an idiotic, screwed-up, 
incompetent company." Apparently, if what he says is true, VIScorp was hardly even in 
communication with him, and they may not have the best in mind for the future of the Amiga.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On the heels of recent events such as the Sassenrath resignation, growing unrest 
and grumbling, and the assertions of our very own Samuel Ormes in the November issue of The 
Amiga Monitor, a certain wave of anti-VIScorp sentiment has been growing in the Amiga community, 
or at least certain parts of it. You can even see evidence of it in The Amiga Monitor, but let me remind 
you that this magazine, and I personally, have no official viewpoint and offer no editorial endorsement 
regarding any companies involved with the Amiga at this time.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Recent reports reveal more shocking revelations: as it turns out, VIScorp is no 
longer the frontrunner in the race to acquire the Amiga, and its contract of acquisition has been 
cancelled. A press release from VIScorp maintains that that was part of the strategy agreed upon 
when executives decided the suggested price for Amiga Technologies was too high. At this point, 
anything can happen. It is important to note that precisely which companies are in the running to 
acquire the Amiga is not known. One can only guess, or follow rumors.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Probably one of the most surprising things to happen recently, however, was a 
second resignation in a matter of a month. My esteemed colleague Jason Compton, in charge of 
public relations for VIScorp, will be leaving VIScorp this month. In contrast to Carl Sassenrath, 
Compton's posting on Usenet was far less scathing. It gives little in the way of reason, and 
emphasizes that he will be leaving VIScorp on good terms. Exactly what will result from all this is yet 
to be seen.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If nothing else, one may draw the conclusion that with Sassenrath and Compton 
gone, VIScorp has little remaining in the way of a connection to the Amiga community; in fact, we 
know little of exactly what they care to do with it, aside from build set-top boxes. Perhaps it would be 
in their best interest, if they do acquire the Amiga, to release a VERY detailed account of exactly what 
they hope to do. They must listen to the Amiga community as well.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If anybody is still wondering what I meant with my reference to "AmiGate" (credit 
to Kyle Webb for that pithy little expression), it has to do with past and present events within the 
American government that, as a whole, have led us to seriously question the ethical motives, or the 
ethical principals themselves, of our government officials, and how we should expect them to treat us 
in other areas as well. Virtually the same exists in the Amiga community. Our experiences have 
begotten deep distrusts that, deserved or not, greatly affects everyone's views of events in the world 
of Amiga. If ever there was a good way to become cynical, this is surely it.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's hard to tell what anybody's motives are now, especially with the restrictions 
legalities place upon corporate openness. Let me just say, however, to any company that is vying for 
the Amiga technology that may be reading this (VIScorp or otherwise), that we hope you really do 
have good intentions for the future of this platform, and if you do, then we're all for you; but if you 
don't, then please withdraw your negotiators immediately and leave it to someone who really does 
care.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We really have had just too many of the empty promises, and I have to wonder if 
any of us, or the Amiga itself, can take much more of this.</P>
