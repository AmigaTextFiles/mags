<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">DiskSalv 4</H1>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I>Dave Haynie's time-honored solution for when your Amiga's disks are a 
bit under the weather</I></H4>
<HR>


<CENTER><H3>Oh no! Not that "disk error!"</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Augh!! You put HOURS into that report, and now your Amiga can't seem to read 
the disk! Or that animation that took <I>weeks</I> to render has kicked the big bit bucket! What are 
you to do?!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, first you soundly reprimand yourself for not backing up your data (tsk tsk 
tsk!); but since all that won't bring back your work, and you <I>really</I> do want it back, there is an 
answer. And that answer bears the name DiskSalv.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Dave Haynie's legacy in the Amiga community stretches far and wide, but 
certainly one for which many of us users have thanked him over the years is his wonderful disk 
utilities program, DiskSalv. It has seen a number of versions, and the latest comes to us with a fully 
graphical interface (nicely style guide-compliant). It is now offered as a true commercial program from 
<A HREF="http://www.iam.com">IAM (Intangible Assets Manufacturing)</A> for about $35 U.S.</P>

<HR>

<CENTER><H3>So what can it do?</H3></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ds2.gif"></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Although generally considered a "disk recovery program," DiskSalv has a number 
of capabilities. In all, it includes 7 modes:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Salvage:</B> The default option; this will do everything it can to recover anything that might 
have a dream of being recovered, far gone as it may seem.
<LI><B>Undelete:</B> Many people don't realize it, but when a disk operating system deletes a file, 
rather than actually expunge the bits from the disk like an exterminator after cockroaches, it simply 
marks the space previously occupied by the file as usable. Therefore, if you hurry and try before DOS 
uses it again for some other file, you can usually get it back. This probably should be part of the OS, 
but DiskSalv provides that ability.
<LI><B>Repair:</B> This tries to fix things that are readable to DiskSalv, but not to the very picky 
(with good reason) AmigaDOS.
<LI><B>Unformat:</B> <I>"Oh darn, lookey what I did. Formatted the dag blamed disk!"</I> This 
goes right along with the "Undelete" prodedure outlined above. A full format of a disk will wipe out 
anything that's there. Sorry. But a quick format (which you may see if you use the AmigaDOS disk 
formatting program) really does nothing but <I>tell</I> DOS that the disk is empty. Not so. DiskSalv 
will save the day.
<LI><B>Check:</B> The "try before you buy" of disk salvaging. The program tells you that 
sometimes you might want to do this before trying to Repair a disk, as Repairing might actually have 
detrimental effects, depending on what you're doing. This will give you a good idea what to do next.
<LI><B>Backup:</B> No need to curse yourself ever again for not backing up data! Here's an easy 
way to do it.
<LI><B>Cleanup:</B> Remember how AmigaDOS doesn't actually grind up, toss out, and sweep up 
after old files? Using this option, DiskSalv will find files in various states of deletion (who cares if it's in 
the dictionary or not) and get rid of the trash. It will speed up disk performance, especially under 
DiskSalv itself. One other thing: Cleanup is <B>NOT</B> to be run before Undelete ;-).</P>
</UL>

<CENTER><H2>Scanning...</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ds3.gif"></CENTER>

<BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>...and then the results.</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ds4.gif"></CENTER>

<CENTER><H3>What Else?</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Aside from repairing disks, DiskSalv can also provide a wealth of information 
about your devices.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Wondering about your filesystem? DiskSalv probably supports it: OFS, FFS, DC, 
International, You Name It. Also featured is AFS for all fans of alternative (filesystems). It is also 
capable of making a "Best Guess" if you aren't sure, if the disk is in really bad shape, or if you enjoy 
making software do really interesting things.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I mentioned that this version of DiskSalv includes a GUI. Well, it's more than just 
a couple of 3D gadgets. The program has various small pictures to illustrate your current mode, and 
there is a whole array of 3D image button gadgets. On running, the program displays a nice opening 
graphic, and the About... menu item does as well. I might also point out that what few bugs I've found 
seem to be associated simply with rendering the graphic imagery in various screenmodes...nothing 
major. I would also point out that the apparently homemade 3D image gadgets invert using some of 
the lower colors of the palette, resulting in a somewhat odd effect in screens with more than 4 colors. 
Nothing major, though.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Oh, and I might also point out that DiskSalv features a very comprehensive 
context-sensitive online AmigaGuide help system. That's always a <B>BIG</B> plus in my book. The 
help file doubles as the program's documentation, so you can browse through a whole assortment of 
descriptions, ideas, texts, and other various information on a wide variety of subjects, including why 
DiskDoctor never really made it, if you remember those days. I must have spent about half an hour 
reading through the help file when I first got the program. If you're into Amiga history or information, 
it's good reading.</P>

<CENTER><H3>In Conclusion...</H3></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I will recommend outright that anybody with an Amiga should have this program. 
It has many great capabilities, and I know from experience that there are many times when I wish I 
had had it. It would have saved a greate deal of trouble. In the future, though, it will be here in times 
of disk-trouble. If the magnetic bits of data once again scatter themselves a-sprawl and asunder 
through my Amiga's file system, I'll be sure to entrust the grand DOS-Covenant to DiskSalv Version 4. 
Unless a new version comes out before then.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In all seriousness, though...it's a big pain when data gets garbled, and it's good to 
have something that will endeavor tirelessly to save it for you. And then it will allow you to back it up 
in the future so such things no longer occur...</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I might also propose that future versions of Amiga OS include DiskSalv or a 
version thereof (?). A good OS is one that helps the user.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One final note: the program comes in a small package, wrapped in a paper 
covering, since the documentation is disk-based. And there is a short, but very telling message on the 
packaging. I'm sure all Amiga users of today can identify with it. Let's just say it exemplifies the 
immense frustration and consternation one can experience in trying to figure out just who owns the 
Amiga, did own it, and shall own it, and what they intend to do with it. It's easy to get confused. 'Tis a 
bittersweet world.</P>
