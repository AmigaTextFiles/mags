<H4 ALIGN=center><I>Geodesic lets your Amiga make sights from sound with this
hardware/software package. </I></H4>

<HR>

<BR>

<P>If Geodesic has endeavoured to released a unique product for the Amiga, they have succeeded. 
The Amiga has always been strong in both video and audio. From the beginning many companies, 
Commodore included, have mated audio with video on the Amiga platform in the form of animation 
formats, games and multimedia authoring software. MindEYE seeks to instead mate video with audio. 
Through a combination of software and hardware, mindEYE creates moving images from sound.</P>

<P>MindEYE consists of a small piece of hardware which connects by a supplied cable to your 
Amiga's joystick port. This small box has, on its rear, the 9-pin port to connect to your Amiga and a 
3.5mm stereo jack audio input to connect to your audio equipment's line out. This cable you have to 
supply yourself, or you can use the built-in microphone on the unit's front panel. Also in the front of 
the hardware are two knobs for adjusting the gain and threshold levels and two small LED's to show
the bass and treble level of the audio input. The package comes with a comprehensive manual and 
will come with a tutorial video when it is completed.</P>

<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=center><B>Installation</B></H3>

<P>Not much to say about installation. Plug the hardware into your joystick port, hook up your audio 
source to the audio input (if applicable), and copy the eyedir directory from the program disk to your 
hard drive (if running from the hard drive) or just start the program from the floppy. Then just start the 
Eye program and it is off and running. Setting up the hardware then just involves turning up the gain 
knob until the two LED's start flashing on the front of the unit. The software includes a scope to allow 
finer adjustments of the sensitivity of the hardware and software. This is important since the bass and
treble levels are used to trigger program options called "visuals" to generate animated screens.</P>

<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=center><B>Use</B></H3>

<P>Once started, mindEYE greets you with a program that looks distinctly 1.3 but this is because it 
can run on a 1.3 to 3.x Amiga with OCS, ECS and AGA supported in the latest version of the 
software. This can put people off, but since this software is geared toward use live in clubs, concerts, 
and videos it is not a problem since in those settings the use of the extensive keyboard controls 
rather than a GUI is required. In fact, many options are only available via keyboard.</P>

<P>The program starts in "evolve" mode. That is, the program changes the options on its own, 
continually changing faders, visuals (the "sound responsive pattern generation scheme"), blankers, 
scrolling, background pictures (IFF), color cycling, and brushes (IFF). This allows the uninitiated to be 
treated to a continually changing display. To really use this software though, you have to learn how
all of these elements go together and how to access them through the keyboard. To assist this, the 
manual has 5 tutorials to get you started. Built-in help facilities help show you how your keyboard 
input is changing the modifiers which affect the different screen elements, from blanking speed to 
scroll type. Since the user has control over the sensitivity of the hardware, the sensitivity of the 
software, the visual elements used, and the audio source, the animated screens that mindEYE can 
generate are infinite. MindEYE is even thoughtful to include the ability to freeze the screen with the 
space bar to allow any Amiga screen grabber program to save any you find interesting to disk. Below
are some I got from my AGA A1200, two using pictures I took as backgrounds. One is my Amiga 
setup and the other is the inside of my Amiga 2000. Can you tell which is which? The third image is 
created entirely from mindEYE's visuals.</P>

<CENTER><H3><B>Results/Analysis</B></H3></CENTER>
<P>Though the learning curve is quite steep, this product does what it does well. It is nothing new to 
see an Amiga doing full screen, real-time animation, but to realize that the Amiga is creating the 
animation itself is nothing short of amazing. This system is capable of creating some stunning and 
active screens which move and change to the beat of the music or whatever other sound source
you choose.</P>

<CENTER><H3><B>Suggestions for improvement</B></H3></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI><B>Better Graphical Interface</B><BR>
This one is on its way. According to the mindEYE manual, an ARexx interface is in the works that 
allows one Amiga to be the controller using a GUI to control a second Amiga equipped with the 
mindEYE.
<LI><B>Control Over Evolve</B><BR>
Evolve, which is much like the "random" setting on a screen blanker, has no user control. It will 
randomly select any visual it wants. This is partially rectified with something called Ensembles, which 
require you to enter which visuals you want included through the keyboard. A GUI in which you can 
just click on the names of the visuals and other options you don't want Evolve to use would greatly 
enhance the usability of this feature.
<LI><B>Better Palette Requester</B><BR>
The palette requester is unusable at high resolution. Use of the standard 2.x/3.x-type palette 
requester would keep the user from having to change screenmode to lo-res just to use this feature.

<TR><TD>Installation:</TD><TD>85%</TD><TD>While installation is easy enough by hand, I think 
the use of Installer would appear more professional.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Ease of use:</TD><TD>75%</TD><TD>Not easy to use due to the extensive keyboard 
support, and lack of a usable GUI for many options.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Compatibility:</TD><TD>100%</TD><TD>Since all Amigas have joystick ports, this is no 
problem. It only would not run on my 512k Amiga 1000.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Performance:</TD><TD>98%</TD><TD>The only time the animation slows is when my 
A1200 goes to get something from its internal Hard Drive.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Features:</TD><TD>95%</TD><TD>Great configurability (through the keyboard) and 
many features.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Interaction with author:</TD><TD>100%</TD><TD>Very happy to answer questions 
about their product and give advice on how to use it. They even have been placing pictures to use as 
backdrops on their web site to supplement the included lo-res backdrops included.<TD></TR>

<TR><TD><H5><B>Overall Score:</B></H5></TD><TD><H5>92.2</H5></TD><TD>This package 
is definitely a very interesting product for the Amiga. The GUI, however, begs improvement and the 
price tag ($275 American) could put off the casual user.</TD></TR>
