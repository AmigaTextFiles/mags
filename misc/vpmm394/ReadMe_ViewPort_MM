Welcome to the second Multimedia edition of ViewPort!

As far as we can determine, you'll need 2 megabytes of RAM, with at least
one megabyte of chip RAM to run ViewPort.  This version has not been
tested on a 512k chip RAM machine, so this is our best estimate.

You will need version 1.52 (or later) of Helm or the Helm Browser.
You'll find the Helm Browser in the GEnie *StarShip* library as file
#22575, or you can use the Helm Updater, file 22561, to patch versions
1.46 through 1.51.

The controls for ViewPort should be intuitive.  However, most objects in
the book have built-in help; just press the Help button on your keyboard
and your cursor will turn into a Help arrow.  Click on the object for
which you need help, and a "blackboard" will pop up.

The magazine works best with faster processors.  If you're using a
68000-based machine, there will be a pause whenever you turn the page or
encounter an effect.  If you have enough RAM, you will be able to speed
operations by running the book from RAM.
