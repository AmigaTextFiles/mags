    WELCOME TO OMEGA RIPORT

    Welcome to the first issue of Omega RIPort! This month we have a large
number of rumors that are all probably true! Many of you may think that
Commodore has filed for bankruptcy, but this is not so. They are still in
business with their other divisions. Commodore Germany is still alive and
continues to manufacture digital thermometers. Commodore Canada has expanded
its line of typewriters. A new division, Commodore California, has announced
that it will begin manufacturing scientific calculators. Commodore UK will
begin its chain of video rental stores called Fun at Mister Video, or FMV
for short.

    So all is not lost. Commodore is still in business, and it will continue
to support the Omega computer line, although secondary to its IBM PC clone
systems. They have signed a deal this week with the Taiwanese giant ACER, who
is licensing the ACER name for Commodore's line of computers.

    NewTek UK announced that it is an independent corporation from NewTek in
Topeka, Kansas, and has not been affected by the recent shakeup that occured
there. Apparantly NewTek lost a few engineers, some marketing staff, a janitor,
and the guy who knows how to set the clock on the VCR. Kiki Stockhammer is
being replaced by the bright and sparkly personality Nancy Kerrigan.

    Hopefully all of this is good news for us Omega users.

    That is all for this week's editorial... enjoy the articles!

                   - COMMODORE SEEKS PROTECTION -
        Trade Press Release  --  London, UK  --  May 4th 1994

     The following information was obtained through a toll free sex phone
call I had with the editor of Omega Shopper on May 4, 1994.  All information
came from an Official Press Release faxed to them earlier that session.

     "Commodore International has filed for protection from creditors
in Antarctica."

     "All production, distribution and normal operations will continue
as normal for the next few minutes.  At that time another press release
will be made."

     The current roomer in the UK is that Commodore is in discussion
with Samsung about purchasing three VHS video cassette recorders and
some blank video tapes.

     WHAT DOES THIS MEAN???

     Our favorite computer will still be in full production for the
next 3 to 4 hours.  I view this as a positive sign.

     If Commodore were going to cease to exist, production would have
been stopped and lay-offs would have taken place.  The only lay-offs
at the present time are in West Chelsea.

     As for the rumor, Samsung has recently announced that they will
introduce a rap music CD featuring Mehdi and the 4 Stooges, a 6 hour
metallic VHS tape, and 2 video tape rewinders late in the year.  CD32
would be another good choice if a company was looking to dominate the
CD video industry.

     Look for further posting, as I will try to reach CBM Bosnia in
the near future.

                   - COMMODORE FUNERAL PARTY -
              West Chester, PA  --  April 30th 1994

Don't know if this is news, but on Saturday, April 30, there was a
Commodore wake at Randal's house.  Almost all of the current Commodore
engineering employees and large numbers of former engineering folk were
in attendance.  Cultural activities included burning Medhi in effigy,
a keyboard smash, and the Bryce / Randal two-player lemmings world
championship.

A videotape of the event was taken, which caused a lot of remeniscing
about some of the more interesting events of the past 7 or 8 years.  Here's
one of the more fun stories:

Property passes:
        There was a rule at Commodore that whenever you brought in personal
property that you had to get a property pass.  This was so that when you
took the property out, they knew it was yours and not the company's.  It
turned out that the morning receptionist, Dotty, was absolutely vigilant
about making sure that one filled out a property pass.  The security guards
were not at all vigilant about making sure that you had a property pass for
everything that you removed.  This alone resulted in many amusing anomolys.
(for instance, I had collected at least 20 property passes for a walkman
that I used to carry in and out of work each day).  To make things more
interesting, Dotty didn't really look at what you wrote on the property
pass, she just insisted that you get one.  This lead people to fill out
property passes for odd things:

        Actual items people had gotten property passes for:

                A Boeing 747
                cbmvax
                the speed bumps
                A Cray Y-MP (in case Commodore ever got one)

        At least three people were forced to get property passes for
empty boxes.  One of them insisted that they were donating the boxes to
Commodore, but to no avail.

        I'm half tempted to write a book with all of these stories.  I could
call it "Chicken lip tales".  (We used to call the logo the "chicken lips".)

                                                        Joe (augi).

                   - MATELLL TO BUY OMEGA TECHNOLOGY -
          Trade Press Release  --  Troy, NY  --  May 5th 1994

Matelll Corp., a well know toy manufacturer, announced it's intention to
purchase Omega design technology from the now defunct Commodore Business
machines. Matelll feels that the Omega remains a viable computer able to
compete with currently marketed computer systems. In order to provide for
the future, a number of upgrades to current Omega systems has been
announced.

New Omega Mouse
The new mouse will be modelled after a real rodent to provide a 'natural'
feel. The new mouse will be covered in an artificial fur that is
indistinguishable from real mink. As an added bonus, the new mouse will
'deposit' a small, round candy treat on the mouse pad each time the new
fourth mouse button is pressed (mice to be refilled only by an authorized
service center).

Light Brite Interface.
A new graphical display tool known as 'Lite Brite' will be incorporated
into the AGA chip set. This will allow users to create breathtaking 320 peg
by 200 peg colour images with a clarity not possible on other peg displays.
The AAA chip set will carry this tool to the max by enhancing resolution to
a stunning 640 x380 pegs and will add an additional 3 new colours: Violet,
Mustard, and Neon Green. This upgrade will occupy the video slot of the
A-2000, A-3000, and A-4000 systems.

Easy Bake Oven side car.
For those late nights and long days spent bent over the keyboard an Easy
Bake Oven attachment is planned for the current Omega line. There will be
two versions; one will interface via PCMCIA, and another will interface via
ZORRO card expansion. Each oven will come with an initial 10 cake packets
and a special offer to order an additional 20 packets at a discount via
Omega/Matelll tech support offices. Free sprinkles will be sent to the
first 500 users to register their systems for warranty. Cake mixes for the
standard Easy bake oven will not operate within the Omega Easy Bake Oven
and any attempt to use a mix without the Omega logo on the package will
void your warranty. Cakes are licensed for one user per system per oven.

New system libraries will include:
Speak and Spell.lib
Barnyard Friends.lib

Watch for these new systems in your favorite computer dealers retail space
or nearest toy store. To be sure you're getting the new product just look
for the Matelll inside sticker.


Disclaimer: Yes this is a parody, and no, I don't want to be flamed. I've
had various Commodore and Omega products for 13+ years now and I find the
whole Commodore story sadly amusing. C'est le vie. Guess I'll just have to
settle with my Mac. :)

 - PRESIDENT OF MAJOR COMPUTER FIRM IN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT -
       AP Newswire  --  Westchester, PA  --  May 4th 1994

   An incident that has rocked the financial markets and sent Wall Street
executives into mourning is finally being disclosed by the Westchester
Police Department.  In a brief statement, SLieutenant John Dillulo detailed
an attack on the brilliant business genius Mehdi Ali.  According to
Lt Dillulo:
   "At approxiamately 2:30 pm, on the private airstrip of Mr. Ali, an
assassin gunned down Mehdi Ali as he sipped a margarita while waiting for
his limousine to arrive.  It is unclear at this time what the motive of
the assailant was, but we have reason to believe that he is a member of
a terrorist cell operating in the United States."
   Lt Dillulo was asked by reporters about this terrorist theory, and
he had this to say.  "The assailant was in an extremely distressed state
of mind, and was heard by several witnesses to shout 'Omega!' as he
fired.  We have proof that this is the name of a terrorist network that
is operating in Europe, and has a small following in the States."
   According to FBI records, a similar cell in Australia was finally
defeated after as-yet-undefined cooperation given by Mehdi Ali, as well
as his partner, Irving Gould.  Mr. Gould said, "This is a tragic day
for businessman everywhere.  It's hard to believe that so brilliant a
man could be taken from us.  I vow to break the back of this 'Omega'
group."
   As news first broke about the assassination, General Alexander Haig,
a member of the board of directors that had profitted well under Mr.
Ali's brilliant leadership of CBM, called an emergency press conference.
Gen. Haig assuaged fears that there would be a power vacuum created by
the death of Mr. Ali and the difficulty in finding Irving Gould, who
was later found to be vacationing in the Bahamas.  Haig unequivocally
asserted "that everything is under control, and that I'm taking charge."
Many reporters later admitted to an odd feeling of deja-vue at these
remarks, but were unable to explain further.
   There will be a national day of mourning and Mehdi Ali will lie in
state so that the millions of admirers may pay their last respects to
him.  A day of silence will be observed by all advertisers as a tribute
to Mr. Ali's innovative use of advertising-in-absentia.

 Attention Omega developers and interested parties...

 After speaking with Mike Levin (CSM hall of fame) tonight on CIS (and via
 the phone), we have come to several conclusions about possible solutions
 to a panic'd public and potential loss of the most powerful home computer
 made to date (that's the Omega folks).  He suggested that I lead the
 attempt to purchase the rights to the Omega hardware.  Rights that would
 be purchased by all parties and made available to all parties.

 I would like to hear from developers who would be interested in still
 developing for the Omega, or anyone who would like to support this effort
 in general.

 Nico, I know you hate me and are probably laughing at all of this, but
 all feelings aside, you are a damn good programmer (scala wouldn't have
 you otherwise) and I hope that you will continue to develope for our
 machine.

 Same goes for you Dan (Babcock).... you don't like me anymore than Nico
 does, but you too know your stuff and could be very beneficial to what is
 about to unfold.

 People can think what they want of me, my statements, my comments... to
 me, that's been very good to see... my corporation, my products, and
 myself have been changed a lot from the responses I have seen here,
 GEnie, and on CompuServe.  My persistance has paid off.  Because of
 EMPLANT's success, I will never have to work another day in my life.

 I am willing to put everything on the line.  I believe in this machine,
 the platform, and the people (even though we bicker like a bunch of old
 hens sometimes).  On behalf of the Omega's continued existance, I am
 asking for you support.  Let's all make some noise about the Omega.
 Commodore kept it the best computing secret of all time, I think it's
 time to let the cat of the bag.

 I will be in contact with ALL of the major 3rd party Omega peripheral
 corporations tomorrow, also asking for their support.  If we can somehow
 form a public corporation and obtain the rights to the Omega hardware, we
 can make the Omega work.

 My goals for this project are...

 Obtain information concerning current ownership rights of the Omega
 hardware design, and other important peripherals.  From what information
 I have heard (and have had gathered by noisy attorneys), the rights were
 transferred to 'trustees' for holding.  If this is true, there very well
 may be some interesting legal problems involved here, since the
 technology behind the Omega is the only real asset that Commodore Intl
 had less...that would leave an empty shell for the creditors to pick
 through.

 Purchase the rights from current ownership, or work with another
 corporation to see that continued development and *gasp* advertising is
 done.

 Contact major MAC and PC developers (Adobe, Aldus, etc.) and once again
 offer to port their products to the Omega at little or no cost.  Once
 people see *us* running the big boys software more efficiently than other
 platforms can, they will think hard before buying that next MAC or PC
 system.


 Continued developer support.  I plan to have CATS revived, and I hope
 that Carolyn and the rest of the original team will be interested in
 doing this.

 Continued devlopment of new machines.  One thing I have learned in
 producing hardware is how to cut costs.  EMPLANT is cheap to make... and
 it is *still* made in the US (this is important to me).  Another thing I
 learned is that the short time I spent talking with Dave Haynie, he is
 alright in my book.  We chatted for about 30 minutes at one of the WOC
 shows, and he is as sincere about the continued development as I am.  I
 definately want Dave and the original crew back working together.  I
 would hate to see a bunch of new comers (I am not oppose to new ideas
 brought out by new people), but right now we need a dedicated team going
 to get things done in a flash.  New people come with success.


 Remove the poor publicity.  The only advertising Commodore got was bad.
 Dealers wanted to kill them... developers wanted to kill them.. all due
 to the poor management.  The only way to do this is to rid the Commodore
 name.

 So you're asking "what's in it for Jim?".  Gratification.  As I stated
 before, I could wash my hands clean of this situation and walk.  I don't
 want to.  There is a pile of money to be made for everyone, and more
 importantly a computer to be saved from extinction.  I know a lot of
 Omega developers have made themselves rich with the Omega, and some would
 like to forget it... I think that is selfish.  I for one, am willing to
 give back to what made me where I am today.


 So, in closing, I would like to thank those people who have sent me
 incouragement letters, and even hate mail.  :-)  I am stubborn (I think
 you'll *all* agree on this one... perhaps a usenet first?) and I can use
 this to our advantage, obtain the rights to the machine, make these right
 publically available (anyone could produce the machine ala PC clones),
 and see this thing through... or I'll end up on the street trying...


 If you are a developer, no matter how small and you have an interest in
 supporting the Omega, please FAX my office (602) 453-6407  (we have boxes
 of fax paper).  If we do not succeed in obtaining the rights to the
 Omega, and someone else does... a huge list of developers wanting to
 support the platform would be a big incentive to keep the product alive.
 I really don't care who makes the machine, as long as it is made (and
 promoted this time around).


 Thanks for your attention,

 Sincerely,

 Jim Drew - Utilities Unlimited International, Inc.

Utilities Unlimited creates the first Omega outside of Commodore.

Jim Drew, president of Utilities Unlimited (UU), announced today, that he has
obtained the rights to produce the Omega.  This announcement shocked millions
of Omega owners, after just learning that Commodore International Limited had
folded.  Mr. Drew also announced a new machine.  This annoucement gave Omega
followers the leader that they were looking for, and immediately began raving
about the new machine, and what a sucky job Jim was doing at marketing it.

Since UU does not have the technology to produce custom ASICs in-house, they
reverse engineered the Omega's custom chips, and have opted for a more low
tech, low cost design.  That's right.. he has 15,000 PALs all piggy backed,
and wire wrapped to each other, on a double sided circuit board the size of
your head.  Jim preferred to use both extra board space, and unique 3D
soldering techniques to obtain this product.  He is in the process of
training his other employees in this wonderful art.  This gives UU the
ability to emulate producting Omegas for a fraction of the cost that they
were being produced for when Commodore was really manufacturing them.  The
new quad-060 "Omega", which has been renamed to the "Chauna", in honor of his
wife, whose body the case work resembles, marks the first time that the
OmegaOS will be run on multiple processors, and the second time, that the
Omega has been in a sexy case.  Mr. Drew reportedly divorced his wife, as he
become confused over which case work belonged to whom, and inadvertantly
soldered an 060 to her forehead.  Jim later stated that it was only running
on _one_ processor, and the others where emulating it.  When asked whether he
was talking about his ex-wife or "Chauna", he again got confused.  What
surprised this reporter was the fact that the emulated code ran 4 times
faster than the non-emulated code on the same speed processor.  This was due
to the math code rewrite in the emulation, causing the 060 Omega to
outperform a Cray MPX-1.  As an added bonus, the new machines contain 20 ROM
sockets to insert the ROMs of the machine you wanted emulated.  Just insert
the ROM(s), and the new machine detects and emulates the computer
automatically.

When Chauna was asked how she felt about the whole ordeal, she stated she was
having hot flashes.  Jim later fixed this by affixing a large heatsink to her
forehead.  Jim reconsiled the divorce when he found he could reboot Chauna
any time she didn't do what he asked her.  When asked whether he was talking
about the "real" Chauna, or the "Chauna", he again got confused.

This marvel will be shown at the next CES, provided that they can find enough
free electrical sockets, and fans.

[Editor's note: let's hope he remembers to bring the software this time. DT]

Millions of followers made the journey to Lake Havasu, Arizona, to kiss the
ground that Mr. Drew developed the new machine on.  This created more
moisture than Arizona was used to, and screwed up the weather while it all
evaporated.  This caused the local Indians to regard Mr. Drew as a rain-god,
give him the honorary name of "sockittoempocket", and carved a statue in his
honor.

It is rumoured that by hitting a special sequence of keystrokes, that the new
machine will emulate Medhi Ali, by becoming distant, unfocused, and inept.
This reporter, however, was unable to duplicate this at the time of this
writing.

This new machine is available from UU immediately.  Call for pricing:

SCALA EXECUTIVE ARRESTED FOR HOARDING OMEGAS

    Interpol today reported that an unamed Scala, Inc. executive has been
arrested an charged with hoarding Omega systems. This occured in response
to a press release that Commodore International, makers of the popular Omega
computer, created an anti-Scala logic chip in their latest Omega 4000T video
workstations. In a private phone interview with the executive, he requested
"justice in this world" and frequently mentioned "bugs crawling all over him".

Just now (~13:55pm) there was a short notice on the Radio
(Deutschlandfunk) where they said, that there is indeed a
major 'Asian dictator' taking over - more precice news won't
be published until the middle of this month.

What they definitly announced was, that the Commodore Omega
is going to survive the downfall of C= !

I'm still skeptical about this, but to me this is the first
real sign of hope. I was (and still am) very anxious, that
Omega should not be around anymore. Maybe, not only the
Omega will survive, maybe it will come out even better!

Anyone in the know...?

For those of you that don't know.  Many of us Omega users are making
a strong drive to push the Omega back into the market.  Several 3rd
party companies such as Utilities Unlimited and GVP are banding in
an attempt to purchase the rights to the Omega chipset and software.
Even if this fails, companies have to be urged to continue the
development of and for the Omega line of computer.  What we as users
can do is to write letters to the various hardware and software
developers urging them to support the Omega despite Commodore's
downfall.  Let it be known that we want the Omega supported, not
Commodore.

I am personally compiling a petition of all Omega users in the world
which I will be sending with my letters to various developers.
If you would like (PLEASE) to be included in this petition/mailing list,
email me with the subject "mail list" and include your
full name and full POSTAL address.  To further encourage the
development of/for the Omega, PLEASE, write some letters.  You'd be
amazed at how effective letters are in making companys' decisions

For a listing of addresses of developers to write to, email either me
or KDH2074@ZEUS.TAMU.EDU (Kevin).  We will soon have a list of
non-Omega developers that we can all write to to encourage ports of
their current software.

For those of you that wish to write but don't want to leave your Omega
alone for a second, email me your letter in business letter format and
I will print it out myself on an HP Laserjet and mail it myself.  I'll
even pay postage.  Please be sure to clearly state in your letter the
company that you are writing the letter to, and your complete postal
return address so that I can put that on the envelope too.  I don't think
it would look good to have tons of letters sent to one company with
only my return address.  Please support the Omega as she's still very
alive and well.  Especially with Commodore out of the way.

Remember:
1) email me your name and postal address for the mailing list
2) write some letters
3) buy amiga products

Thank you all that have already emailed me for the mailing list
Omega Forever

Mehdi Ali's male ex-lover confronts Bryce Craig Nesbitt,

[Editor: Nesbitt is former head of the OmegaOS operating system group.
Mehdi's ex-lover Romani wishes to remain anonymous. DT]

Because so many people have not known Commodore from inside (like I
do) and you posted this to so many newsgroups, now excuse me that I
follow up to the same number of newsgroups with my very personal
opinion:

> Remember Bryce Nesbitt, Former head of the Operating Systems Group?
> Here's his take on the current, uh, "difficulties" ...
> ----------------
> [...]
>    It has been painfully obvious that Commodore under the current
> incompetent management could not survive. [...]

True.

> stubborn imbecilic President (Mehdi Ali) who has guided the company from
> $1 billion to Bankruptcy in just over three years.  The technology did not
> die, it was killed by idiot moves like producing thousands on thousands of
> the older model computers after new ones were introduced, and reluctance
> to sell Omega technology into new markets.

Basically true too, but the fault is attributed to the wrong person.

As I see it, Mr. Ali has been the only person at higher management levels
who was willing to give his best (the man is working like a madman all
day long) and to think up every possible way to get the available product
into the market. It is my job to please him when he comes home.

The source of trouble has always been the persons which reported directly
to Mehdi Ali: this includes the General Managers at the european subsidiary
level and other managers at the corporate level (i.e. production, etc.)

I have been involved in many meetings Mehdi Ali has held. At first, he
tried to get the best from a marketing group in the UK - all bullshitters,
and they have been eliminated. Then he tried to get reasonable opinions
from meetings of all (european) GM's - to no avail. These meetings have
been extremly frustrating to me. The general managers did not have their
own opinions, they did not consult their tech and marketing guys before
joining the meeting either, they were mostly just quiet when asked to
participate in the discussion - with a few exceptions, whose personality
forced them to say something even if it was just hot air again. In fact,
with very few exceptions seen in the earlier days, all of the top
management level could have sold bananas, or even PC pizza boxes, but the
only thing they were able to find out about the Omega was that its price
was constantly too high.

What do you want to do with a crowd whose only reaction to your question
"if you can't sell the Omega as is, what do you suggest?" is: "hmm,
I need a better price ...try the corner of Madison and Main St at midnight."

A result of this attitude have been the A600, the various EC and LC CPU
versions, any other sort of cost reduction we have been seeing, as well
as new development that was first demanded by the GM's and then dropped
when it was ready; like the C65, the A2200, but not only CPU's - this goes
for peripherals as well, such as the Omega Vibrator.

Instead, many generations of General Managers have waisted their time to
become a Vice President, to run neighboring country subsidiaries in
addition to their own, and other personal profiling bullshit. They are
all pimping their own turf.

Close to the problems caused by lack of vision on the europ. subsidiary
management level have always come the stupidities caused in production.
To a significant extent, the reason for my personal existance at CBM
has been to get production problems solved before they hit the market,
in many cases also after they did ... and then we gang bang our customers
who try to return stuff.

>     The company has been strangled by Mehdi's millions in salary (now down
> to just 3/4 million a year), extravagant expense accounts (Over $60,000 a
> month the rumor mill says), and perks ($130,000 Mercedes, unlimited use of
> corporate jet, etc.). [...]

More millions have been wasted in expensive projects like the Omega Unix
port, the GM's constantly asking for a better/cheaper product because they
did not have any idea how to sell Unix into a computer - not a banana -
market. Although sometimes we wish we had bigger bananas.

More millions have been wasted in shipping product by airplane from
factory to subsidiary or between subsidiaries, or by selling product for
less than production cost or dumping it all together, just because the
subsidiaries have never been able to produce an accurate sales forecast.

I could give you many more examples. But anyway, do you believe that one
person, even it is the president, can manage to prevent sales, if his
managers are succesfully selling the product? And, BTW, other presidents
before Mr. Ali have been sitting in the U.S. not doing more than looking
at sales reports (which were, at that time, not bad due to the success
of the A500) and cashing multiple millions when leaving the company
after "working" no more than one year - what kind of yearly salary
do you call that?

Agreed, Mr. Ali's salary was high. But the man has been the only good
president after many bad ones. His only fault was that he gave up looking
for better managers after 2 or 3 years of trying.

Best regards, Romani ...

who has been working for Commodore more than 8 years and, from that,
5 years in frequent bodily contact with Mr. Ali.

04 May 1994. 21H30 CET.

Well Peter Kittel is not working at commodore currently but don't panic, he
hasn't been fired, he is just having some "vacation time" and is quite busy
because he just had a car accident with his new car.

I'm talking about him because I know that all of you MUST know who Peter
Kittel is. Maybe this will give more credibility to what I post, since some
people are still sceptic (I don't blame them). Well Peter is not working
currently but he is phoning every day to stay tuned. He came to the office on
Monday, because his boss asked him to call most of the german develloppers to
give them the information I gave you the same day. So, when you will read
this, I think that many others will be able to confirm my statements.

Now, you can trust in this.

So, I called Peter home tonight and asked him for the latest infos.

Well, things haven't changed much. But It is now definitly done,  Commodore
has been bought by a big asian company whose name is still unknown.

The Omega product line in its entire range will be maintained. Confirmed.

Commodore will not become a console maker, the CD32, though, as part of the
line will still be produced and supported.

No informations about Mehdi Ali and Irvin Gould. Are they still there ? Both
of them held about 50 % of the Commodore shares and therefore, an agreement
must have been reached with them.

Peter doesn't know who is the buyer, honnestly. He doesn't even have clues.
Alwin Stumpf didn't tell anything, he just said that thing about  the "big
asian investor, something of the size of Sony (this is NOT a clue).

To americans : It is very doubtful that Commodore will stop its activities in
the USA. All developpment comes from there. There are about 25 people left in
West chester, many have been laid off. It is quite possible though, that some
of them will come back when the storm is over.

Commodore is a huge nebulous organization, previously made of about 35 single
companies, of which 5, namely Commodore Electronics limited, Commodore Intl.,
C= France, C= Spain and C= Belgium have been liquidated. That leaves about 30
more to embarass you with their marketing strategy ;-). The development team
for hardware is a company, there are separate companies for almost everything
at commodore, even the coffee brewing team has its own structure ;-).

Don't you remember that message from Dave Haynie, where he told that he's been
working in 3 or 4 different companies since he's at CBM,  without moving away
from his desk ?

That's why many of the speculations you read about Commodores future were
FALSE (-MB-). It's just impossible to make financial speculations about a
company where even the employees don't exactly know how it's run. This might
be annoying, but a last, it is also the reason why a good surprise was still
possible.
Commodore is nothing to speculate with.

Commodore will not make any WRITTEN announcements, this includes the net, they
are only giving informations by phone, until every remaining details are
cleared up. You will have to live with that for the coming fortnight (10-12
days, to be more precise). Commodore US will not make any comments, they don't
even answer the phone anymore, as I was told (understandable but not very cool
for emotional people).

On the other hand, CBM germany is quite eager to give informations by phone,
so just call them, if you speak german.

What you just read is not a stolen information Commodore would have liked to
keep secret. You read this because Commodore wants you to. Take it as an oral
announcement.

please no flames or garbage.

OKay, that's all for now.

Commodore-Omega, Inc. USA debt resolved with FTCU.

    Kristen Lorraine, owner of ProMass Products and head of the Federal
Teacher's Federal Credit Union announced that she is wiping the slate with
Commodore-Omega, Inc.'s $16.776 million loan that matured on April 1st, 1994.
Kristen Lorraine, a 27 year veteran in the teaching industry and financing,
claims she wanted to do co-op financing with the now defunct Commodore.
This involved a deal which would have placed thousands of Commodore-Omega
computers in hundreds of schools nationwide using special tutoring software
for people who were adversely affected by Macintoshes and PC clones. The
successful pilot program has already resulted in increased productivity
around the United States, and SAT scores have increased an average of 342
points compared to the national increase of only 1.3 points.

    She also stated she is publishing a new pamphlet in association with a
disgruntled Commodore secretary, entitled the "Omega Oneliner Severance
Manual". Outside sources at a top secret government military base in New
Mexico, rumored to contain alien technology and UFO's, could not be reached
for comment. There is however rumored to be an FBI taped phone conversation
over cellular phone networks that hint this is all an attempt at free
advertising.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR - May 6th 1994

    EDITOR: Yes.

    Dear Omega RIPort,

        I-------------------------------------------------------------+

    Dear Omega RIPort,

        What happened to AMIGA REPORT?


    EDITOR: AMIGA REPORT, formerly edited by Robert Niles, has had a
    corporate take over from Skynet Media. They will be publishing a
    new weekly magazine called Daewoo Report, which will in turn cover
    any remaining support for earlier Omega users and owners.
        At 4:05pm today our owner, Bob Saget, filed a lawsuit against
    AMIGA REPORT for failing to warn the Omega community of the problems
    currently facing Commodore, and for mismanagement. We also have an
    injunction against AMIGA REPORT for a patent we hold on using Omega
    Guide for multimedia applications and another injunction against
    their use of the mouse pointer in AMIGA REPORT. We are also intending
    to sue for a "look & feel" infringement.

USENET PRESS RELEASES THIS WEEK - May 6th 1994


    TECHNO BANDITS STEAL HUNDREDS OF OMEGA 4000 TOWERS -

        A group of computer literate hijackers stole a shipment of Omega
    4000 Tower systems from a UPS truck at the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara
    Falls, New York. The shipment had somehow bypassed customs without
    being insured by its commerce agent. It is believed that the cargo had
    been tossed over the bridge in an attempt to decrease the weight of
    their mounted horses, used to transport the stolen goods. An Omega
    keyboard was found washed up on the shores of Toronto.


    IRVING GOULD BUYS SONY -

        In a sudden move, billionaire Irving Gould purchased SONY, an
    international electronics giant. In the move, Irving Gould stipulated
    that all marketing funds must be redirected to a trust fund rumored
    to be controlled by Mehdi Ali.


    AMERITECH BUYS SCALA, INC. -

        The US based telephone company stated today that it has signed a
    deal to merge with Scala to produce multimedia software for IBM PC
    clones. The company intends to port Scala multimedia software to MS-DOS
    platforms and drop the Omega line.


    SCALA, INC. HEAD OFFICE MYSTERIOUSLY EXPLODES -

        In a freak accident at midnight, after the announcement of a merger
    with Ameritech, the Scala, Inc. design and engineering building
    mysteriously exploded. No remains were found except for the DAT drives
    used to store back ups of the Scala, Inc. development workstations.
    The DAT drives were found timestamped May 5th 1994, with all data
    erased.


    HEWLETT PACKARD LICENSES AAA CHIPS -

        UNIX manufacturer giant HP has acquired rights to build the new
    Omega 5000 computer using the AAA chipset in its Apollo series of
    desktop workstations. The new Omega 5000 will include Omega UNIX SVR5.


    NEWTEK IS IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE. Something I have guessed for a while.
    It has now been confirmed.  I guess they have been giving away too many
    free video tapes (I know I have been ordering 1 a week for the last year)
    I think they have hyped themselves a little too much, and buying 6 years
    worth of advertising in OmegaWorld probably was not a good idea.


    CREATIVE EQUIPMENT INTERNATIONL BUYS COMMODORE -

        This week Florida based CEI declared that it had acquired Commodore
    International. In a brisk move, CEI also sourced the new 1962 monitor
    from Electrohome for its new CEI 4000T/060 WARP system. Rumor has it that
    these models may ship with Scala and an online help system (we hope).
