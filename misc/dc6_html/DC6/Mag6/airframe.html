<center><h1>Airframe - a book by Micheal Crichton<BR></h1>

<h2>review by Alan Graham</h2> </center><P>

As I travel for 2 hours on a train every day, I get through a fair 
amount of books per week.  I had just finished "Pandora's 
Clock" by John Nance, and wanted more in the "airplane 
disaster" theme.  This looked like a model example of the 
genre, with a "lethal mid air disaster", giving connotations of 
pilots nursing a ruined airliner throughout the book, until a 
heart-stopping heavy landing at the end.<P>

Instead, the disaster was over in a few pages (there must be 
another one, I thought) with the real subject of the book being 
the back stabbing bureaucracy of a commercial airline.  It was 
not what I expected, but very good all the same.<P>

Micheal Crichton keeps the suspense up as a safety team try to 
solve the puzzle against the clock.  A vital foreign sale is 
threatened by the series of accidents, and an answer is wanted.  
With the press baying at the companies heels, the main 
character is put under severe stress on all sides, with the 
workers angry at a decision to move construction out of the 
country, resulting in chaos throughout the factory.<P>

This adds up to an absolute thriller of a book, which actually 
made me <i>want</i> to catch the train.  As I am of a fairly technical 
nature, I enjoyed his in-depth descriptions of intricate aeroplane 
systems, but I can understand that this is not for everyone.<P>

I cannot make your mind up for you, but if you find 
aeroplanes one of the more fascinating inventions of the 20th 
century, or just like a good techno-thriller, then I cannot 
recommend this book enough.<P>

I will end with an extract from the back cover of the book, to 
let you see if you like it or not.<P>

Three passengers are dead.  Fifty-six are injured.  The interior 
cabin virtually destroyed.  But the pilot manages to land the 
plane...<P>

At a moment when the issue of safety and death in the skies is 
paramount in the public mind, a lethal midair disaster aboard a 
commercial twin-jet airliner bound from Hong Kong to Denver 
triggers a pressured and frantic investigation.
