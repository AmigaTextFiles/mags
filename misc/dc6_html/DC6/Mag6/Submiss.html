<P>If you're short of ideas, here's a list of some of the things we are looking for:<UL>
<LI><B>Tutorials</B> - Can be any level, on anything computer related, be it programming, graphics, music, Workbench or whatever - it doesn't have to be brilliant. Just share some of that knowledge and experience with the rest of the Amiga community!
<LI><B>Reviews</B> - Whether you've just bought Quake or a PowerPC board - or you know a PD game that is just excellent to play, then write in and tell us about it. Hardware, software, serious, games or demos, we'll have it all. Reviews of commercial 
products are particularly welcome, as it's useful to get an alternative opinion of what 'paper' magazines have given them.
<LI><B>Game Help</B> - If you know any cheats for a game, or want to send in things like hints and playing guides, then let us have them.
<LI><B>Views</B> - Views on the Amiga or Amiga related events. If 
you'd like to comment on anything, that tell us about it!</UL>
