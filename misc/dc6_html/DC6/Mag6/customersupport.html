<P>From the files of Customer Support :

<P>        A  customer  called  Compaq  tech  support to say her brand-new computer
wouldn't work.  She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it in, and sat there for
20  minutes  waiting for something to happen.  When asked what happened when she
pressed the power switch, she asked, "What power switch?"

<P>        Compaq  is  considering  changing  the command "Press Any Key" to "Press
Return Key" because of the flood of calls asking where the "Any" key is.

<P>        AST  technical  support had a caller complaining that her mouse was hard
to  control  with the dust cover on.  The cover turned out to be the plastic bag
the mouse was packaged in.

<P>        Another  Compaq  technician  received a call from a man complaining that
the  system  wouldn't  read word processing files from his old 5 1/4" diskettes.
After  trouble-shooting  for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the problem, it
was  found  that  the customer labelled the diskettes, then rolled them into the
typewriter to type the labels.

<P>        Another  AST  customer  was  asked  to  send  a  copy  of  her defective
diskettes.   A  few  days  later  a  letter arrived from the customer along with
Xeroxed copies of the floppies.

<P>        A  Dell  technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy back
in  the  drive  and close the door.  The customer asked the tech to hold on, and
was  heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room to close the
door to his room.

<P>        Another  Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax
anything.   After 40 minutes of trouble- shooting, the technician discovered the
man  was  trying  to  fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitor
screen and hitting the "send" key.

<P>        Another  Dell  customer  needed help setting up a new program, so a Dell
tech  referred  him to the local Egghead.  "Yeah, I got me a couple of friends,"
the  customer  replied.   When  told Egghead was a software store, the man said,
"Oh, I thought you meant for me to find a couple of geeks."

<P>        Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer
worked.  He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and water and soaking
the   keyboard  for  a  day,  then  removing  all  the  keys  and  washing  them
individually.

<P>        A  Dell  technician  received  a  call  from  a customer who was enraged
because  his  computer  had  told  him  he  was  "bad  and an invalid." The tech
explained that the computer's "bad command" and "invalid" responses shouldn't be
taken personally.
