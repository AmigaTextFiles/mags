<H1><B><CENTER>Project Alpha - HiQ Announce Plans to Port the Amiga to Alpha</CENTER></B></H1>

<P>We all know about Phase 5's plans to port the Amiga to the PowerPC processor, despite the fact that Amiga International have 
not decided on a future processor. In a similar fashion, HiQ have  now announced plans to port the Amiga to the Alpha processor, using their Siamese RTG.

<P>The Siamese RTG is now available for Alpha. It will mean you can have an Amiga with an Alpha workstation, working together in unison. The Amiga can use the Alpha's graphics card as if it were 
its own - but is still restricted to the 680x0 processor.

<P>So big deal, I hear you say. As good as the Siamese is, it is a far cry from porting the Amiga to the Alpha platform. Well, the 
Siamese is only Stage One.

<P>After this, they will make use of Index's forthcoming InsideOut system. This will be an Amiga on a card to be used with 
an Alpha workstation. This will feature a real 68040/060 processor and AGA chipset for backward compatibility, but the Amiga will be able to access the Alpha processor, and PCI cards.

<P>After that, they will port the AmigaOS to the Alpha processor completely. In time, with emulation, a 680x0 processor and AGA chipset will not be necessary.

<P>You can read all about it <A HREF="alpha.html">here</A>.

<P>They have not stated what Amiga International have had to say about their plans, if anything at all, but hopefully they will grant the necessary licences. It is good to see the HiQ want to port the OS to the Alpha processor, where as Phase 5 have no such 
plans, intending to produce their own OS for the A\BOX machine.
