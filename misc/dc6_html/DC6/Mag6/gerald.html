The only Stephen King book I had read before this was "The Shawshank
Redemption", part of his "Different Seasons" collection of short
stories (I think).  It was brilliant, and could easily have been made
into a full novel.  I quite looked forward to starting this book, as I
enjoy reading other "horror" novels by Dean Koontz.<P>

It begins with a "husband-and-wife game", namely, the wife gets
handcuffed to the bed, etc.  (This is a family disk-magazine, so I
will not go on!).  Needless to say, she is no longer happy at being treated this way, and
lashes out at her husband, causing him to suffer a severe heart attack
and die on the floor beside her.<P>

This presents her with a bit of a problem: she is in a holiday house
in the middle of nowhere, handcuffed securely in police-issue
handcuffs, with no chance of being found.  As you can imagine, she
goes rather nuts, hearing voices in her head and....<P>

Obviously, telling you any more would just be stupid, and ruin the
novel for anyone that did want to read it.  Stephen King concentrates
in experiences of her past to accentuate her madness, giving in depth
descriptions of harrowing sexual experiences of her childhood.<P>

It is not that his descriptions are bad, or that the story is boring,
but there is a lack of the indescribable "something" that really makes
a novel for me.  Other people may like the book and find the in-depth
description of a desperate womans psyche captivating, but not me.<P>

In my opinion, almost any Dean Koontz books are more enthralling, and
if you wish a gripping story over similar lines, try Koontz's
"Intensity" or "The Door to December".<P>
