<P>I don't know how you got hold of this, but it's quite possible you obtained this mag from a PD library, or found it on a CD-ROM. If you want to get future issues, then you may be interested in this subscription service. Think about it, with the time for me to send an issue to PD libraries, for them to advertise it, and then for you to see it and get it could be a delay of two to three months, at least. It would be even longer for it to appear on CD-ROM, and you wouldn't know which one(s) it was on.

<P><B>Subscribe </B>to DoubleClick! to take advantage of the following:<UL>
<LI>Each Issue is sent to you as soon as possible after completion, which should hopefully be a few days at the most. I will probably send out subscription copies before I even send to PD libraries.
<LI>You don't have to look out for a new issue, or do anything, it's sent to you automatically.
<LI>A 'free' advert, if you wish; you don't have to supply an article in this case.
<LI>This is available at a cost cheaper than any PD library that I know of.
</UL>
<P>Also, by subscribing, it lets me know how many people are reading it, as I cannot expect any sort of feedback from PD libraries. So you're helping to support this magazine and its future!

<P><B>Note</B> that if you have internet access, this is not for you! You can apply for <A HREF="inetsub.html">Internet subscription</A>, which is free, quicker and easier, or download from Aminet. This is a service for those without access to the net...

<P><B>Cost...</B>
<BR><TR>For Three Issues of the Full/HTML version, cost is just <B>&#163;4.00</B>, p&amp;p included. Just to emphasise the seriously good value of this, a typical PD library charges at least &#163;1 per disk, plus about 70p p&amp;p. That means three issues would cost &#163;8.10. Not forgetting that you'll have to wait a few months for each issue, effectively being an issue behind.

<P><B>Note</B> that you need a web browser to view the html version (although we do supply AWeb).

<P><B>Additionally</B>, you must also fill in <A HREF="Questionnaire.html">this questionnaire</A> if you want to subscribe. It won't take long, and you'll be helping us. (Although remember, questionnaire replies are greatly appreciated even if you aren't subscribing!)

<P><B>NB</B>: You must specify which issue you want your subscription started with, as a few issues down the road, we won't know which was the last issue you read! (Although you can say 'Starting with the latest version'.)

<P><B>AmigaGuide 'Lite'</B> Version!: As explained elsewhere, this replaces the older 'lite' version, and hopefully you'll prefer it. If you can view AmigaGuides, you can run this. Requires just Workbench 2 and maybe 1MB RAM (Runs okay from floppy). This also costs &#163;4.00 for three issues, p&amp;p included.

<BR><HR>
<BR><B>So </B>how do I subscribe? I hope you ask. Just write to one of the following addresses, enclosing &#163;4.00 either as a cheque (made payable to <B>Mark Harman</B> or <B>Stephen Graham</B> as appropriate), or if you want to send cash (which would be easier), make sure you sellotape it to a bit of card or something, so it isn't obvious that there's money in the envelope! And remember to say which issue you want the subscription started with. <A HREF="contacts.html">The Addresses</A>.
<HR>
<BR><B>Why </B>3 issues? you may be wondering. Well, I don't want to set it too high to begin with, and er don't want to commit ourselves to any great number of issues! If you'd be interested in seeing a longer subscription service, then write and tell us!
