<h2>HiQ "Alpha Project" White Paper</h2>

<!--HTML Markup By CUCUG, Please give credit!-->

For Immediate release   8th January 1998<br>


<P><A HREF="http://www.hiq.co.uk/">HiQ</a> is pleased to announce "Project Alpha" which is an ongoing project
to integrate the Amiga system with the Alpha processor. Already we are
at stage one, the Siamese RTG Software v2.5 which is Alpha and PC
compatible. Following on from this we are determined to see the AmigaOS
ported fully to this powerful chip over the coming 18 months whilst
retaining backward compatibility. For those who have not heard about the
Siamese System please check out our web site at www.siamese.co.uk

<P>The "Project Alpha" plan of action is as follows.

<P><b>Stage one</b>.<br>
Shipping Now!

<P>Siamese RTG System v2.5 links existing Amigas via Ethernet to
any
Alpha machine including the new range supplied by HiQ
<A HREF="http://195.153.251.60/pr-alpha.htm">http://www.siamese.co.uk/pr-alpha.htm</A>.  For those who have not heard about the
Siamese system please check out our web site at
<A HREF="http://195.153.251.60/psiamese.htm">http://www.siamese.co.uk/psiamese.htm</A>.

<P><b>Stage two</b>.<br>
Shipping Q1 1998.

<P>Supplying Alphas to Amiga and Ex Amiga owning customers with one of the
following optional additions, or supplying existing Alpha users with
these products:-

<P>(a)  Adding the Siamese RTG System v2.5 and an Ethernet connection kit
to join the already owned Amiga and Alpha in a seamless link.

<P>(b)  Adding the "Access" Amiga units from Index Information ltd, which
are complete Amigas in a 5.25" drive bay, linked via internal Ethernet
to the Alpha/PC and giving the Digital Video based Alpha access to the
Amigas Analogue Video system to create a combined Analogue / Digital
Video hybrid system.

<P>(c)  Supply an additional Amiga Computer system for the US Video Toaster
market if not already owned, to create the ultimate NTSC Video and 3D
studio system with the accent on integration.

<P>(d)  Supply Amiga Forever as a free add on to encourage the ex Amiga
owning Alpha customer back to the Amiga once more. This will give the
performance of around a 50mhz 68030 based Amiga. Once they grow
accustomed to the Amiga way of doing things they can upgrade to Stage
three.

<P><b>Stage Three</b><br>
In final development, but taking advanced orders now.<br>
Shipping in Q2-Q3.

<P>Designed around the "Inside Out" PCI based Amiga on a card from
Index
Information ltd and the Siamese RTG v3.0 Software from HiQ Limited and
Paul Nolan, this System would create the ultimate Amiga and Alpha
combined Multi-OS machine on the planet and all "Powered By Amiga".

<P>Amiga Features include:-

<ul>
<li> Full Amiga 680x0 backward compatibility with AmigaOS v2.1+.
<li> On board Amiga AGA chip set running up to 30% faster than existing
chip set.
<li> Motorola 68040 or 68060 onboard  with speeds up to 75mhz, depending on
Chip used.
<li> Amiga PCI card design gives access to PCI bus on PC/Alpha motherboard.
<li> Supports all PCI, ISA and USB ports as well as standard ports.
<li> Communication between Amiga processor and Alpha/PC chip and PCI boards
is at PCI bus speeds.
<li> Amiga gets access to the latest high speed graphics cards and can use
the latest drivers.
<li> Amiga gets full blown OpenGL 3D graphics.
<li> Amiga gets Mpeg, AVI, Quicktime etc. Video.
<li> Amiga has access to low cost, less than 200 in price, Digital video
Recording cards.
<li> Amiga gets 16bit Sound and access to Wave Audio system at last via
AHI.
<li> The Amiga can run Macintosh software on high speed graphics cards.
<li> The new Amiga Integrates seamlessly with the WindowsNT operating
system to create a robust and easy to use Amiga / Macintosh / Windows
system.
<li> Alpha speed available at up to 767mhz by Quarter two.
<li> Alpha/PC gets an Amiga Video slot to run the Video Toaster direct from
the Alpha/PC.
<li> Truly a Multi-OS and Multi Processor system for the first time.
<li> 680x0 based Macintosh users can get a huge performance increase and
migrate to NT.
<li> This system is running NOW over Ethernet in stage 1, and this will be
a True "One Box Solution".
</ul>

<P><b>Stage 4</b><br>
AmigaOS to Alpha Porting Plan.<br>
Starts Q2

<P>We aim to Launch the "Project Alpha" porting plans as soon as we ship
stage three, this is because it starts the entire ball rolling with the
first goal of creating an Alpha that is fully backward compatible with
the Amiga. Once the Amiga is ported it will leap frog any other
Processor in one jump.

<P>Obviously the main advantage of this route is that the user has a
machine that can run Amiga, Windows, MSDos, and Macintosh software from
one incredibly powerful and economical system. This system is aimed at
the serious Amiga user and not the budget user today, however the Alpha
is coming down in price and once the porting is complete we expect to
have a base machine for around 1500 which is what an average PC costs
today. This is a realistic target unlike a lot of other so called new
Amigas which will not appear.

<P>Porting Time scale, (very approximate).<br>
Starts from where Stage 3 finishes.<br>

<P><b>Stage 5</b><br>
At Q3-4

<P>Once this system is shipping, all Users who purchased the Alpha
upgrade
path license package will receive their first upgrade. This will include
sections that can be removed from the Amiga OS control fairly easily and
handed over to the Alpha to speed them up. Graphics, Sound file handling
etc.

<P>Improvements to some functions like the maths functions and
additions
to OS, to allow software to call Alpha Maths libraries etc. to speed up
floating point operations.

<P><b>Stage 6</b><br>
At Q1-2 of 1999

<P>Once finished the entire OS will be Alpha based and only using
the
Amiga Card for software that relies on the Amiga Custom Chip set,
although hopefully an ECS and AGA emulator may solve this problem.
However we see the Amiga chip set still being important for Amiga
developers and that it will be needed for some time to come with the
Analogue Video world.


<P>All the best for the Future
