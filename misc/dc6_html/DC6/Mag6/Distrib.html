<HTML><H2><B>Distribution!</B></H2>

<P>DoubleClick! is freely distributable, and we encourage it being given to as many people as possible. The conditions are, however, that none of the magazine is altered in any way (articles, files, the program itself, etc). Also, if any money is 
charged, it must NOT EXCEED &#163;1.20 for a 1 disk issue, &#163;1.50 for a 2 disk issue, and &#163;2.00 for a 3 disk issue (should they appear!) This includes individuals and PD libraries alike!

<P>Also, certain files, such as graphics, samples and source code <I>may </I>used separately from this DiskMag (in your own programs, for example), but others may <B>not</B>! Please read the relevant articles to find out which is the case!

<P>DoubleClick can appear on CD-ROMs without permission. If you want to put it on a BBS, or upload it to the Internet (ie, Aminet), then please do. You are allowed to compress DoubleClick! (eg, DMS, LHA, etc), as long as all the files are included in the archive.

<P><B>Calling all BBS Sysops!</B> We would greatly appreciate it if you were to put DoubleClick! onto your bulletin board. Please write and tell us if you have done this, so I can tell readers where to get hold of future issues (and you'll get a free plug for your BBS). Even better, I would be extremely grateful if someone were to make it so that people could upload articles and contributions for DoubleClick! onto their BBS, which could then be passed onto us. Please write in if you are interested (you will of course get loads of free advertising in the mag, and free  first class 'hot-off-the-press' subscription if you do!)

<P><B>Calling all People-With-a-Lot-of-Contacts!</B> If you have a lot of contacts and want to distribute DoubleClick, or even just to upload to various BBSs then please go ahead, but remember the price restrictions given above (&#163;1.20 for a disk issues, &#163;1.50 for 2 disk issues, &#163;2.00 for 3 disk issues).

<P>If anyone wants to do something more with DoubleClick! (such as maybe putting it on the Web?, or anything else with requires significant alteration of files), you must get my permission first, but I'll be unlikely to object!

<P>Articles remain the copyright of the authors, so they may not be distributed separately to this mag, or used elsewhere unless you have the permission of the author whose article it is.
