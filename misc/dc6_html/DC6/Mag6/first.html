<P>It's your first time.  As you lie back your muscles tighten.  You  put
him  off for  a while searching for an excuse,  but he refuses  to  be
swayed  as he approaches you.  He asks if you're afraid and you  shake
your  head bravely.  He has had more experience,  but it's  the  first
time  his finger has found the right place.  He probes deeply and  you
shiver; your body tenses; but he's gentle like he promised he'd be.
 
<P>He looks deeply within your eyes and tells you to trust him--he's done
this many times before.  His cool smile relaxes you and you open wider
to give him more room for an easy entrance.
 
<P>You begin to plead and beg him to hurry, but he slowly takes his time,
wanting to cause you as little pain as possible. As he presses closer,
going  deeper,  you feel the tissue give way;  pain surges  throughout
your  body  and you feel the slight trickle of blood as he  continues.
He looks at you concerned and asks you if it's too painful.
  
<P>Your  eyes are filled with tears but you shake your head and  nod  for
him to go on.  He begins moving in and out with skill but you are  now
too  numb to feel him within you.  After a few frenzied moments,   you
feel  something bursting within you and he pulls it out of  you,   you
lay panting, glad to have it over.
 
<P>He looks at you and smiling warmly,  tells you,  with a chuckle;  that
you have been his most stubborn yet most rewarding experience.
 
<P>You smile and thank your dentist. After all, it was your first time to
have ......... a tooth pulled.
