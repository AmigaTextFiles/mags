<P>Getting Amiga Format through the door, I ripped open the indesctructible 
plastic cover to see what was in-store today.  Newicons?  Thats the pretty 
icon system that fills up your hard drive and slows down your computer?  
No thanks - I'll stay with my dependable pink & gray MagicWB.  And so life 
went on for several days, until, when I was sitting around one night, rather 
bored (actually, looking for something to do instead of my maths 
assignment!) and decided to install the "revolution for your workbench" as 
David Taylor so nicely put it.....

<P>Using a standard installer, after asking a few probing questions, it set to 
work.  Cliiiick, Whirrr, Clickety Click, (very furious disk activity).   Oh my god, 
OH MY GOD - WHAT HAVE I DONE??  I sit, rather worried, wondering what 
my brother will do to me for wrecking the computer (It's my computer - but 
I get hell when I wreck it? Where's the logic in that?).  As nothing much is 
happening on screen, but a HELL of a lot is happening in the computer, you 
get the impression that it is formatting SYS: or something similar.  What it is 
actually doing is copying NewIcons all throughout the system.  This may be 
seen as a good or bad thing: it is good as, once completed you will have an 
almost ready icon system but, if you are not serious about using NewIcons, it 
only makes the program a pain in the backside to un-install.  Eventually, you 
are asked a few more questions and after a bit more disk thrashing the 
install is complete.

<P>First Impressions?  A load of crap!!  At first the system looks awful with Icons 
unsnapshotted all over the place, and a mixture of New and old icons 
everywhere (the installer is not that thorough, despite all the working).  But 
hold on, reset, change a few variables, copy a few icons and you have a very 
pretty icon system that doesn't chew up the resources it is rumoured to do.

<P>The first thing that must be enabled is all the "transparency" options in the 
prefs.  Unfortunately this makes the remaining MagicWB icons look awful but 
hey, that's life - you can't have everything.  With these options set, and after 
downloading about 4mb more Newicons from the Aminet (which is reason 
alone for you to get some sort of Internet access) it looks damn good.  
Another program supplied with it, Deficon, also streamlines the Newicons 
system by allowing default commands to be given to files with no icons.  For 
example, I am working on a script to automatically unpack .lha's to a 
directory of your choice, chosen by an ASL requestor!  Saves a lot of time.  
Once I get the script wokring perfectly, it may be released with the next 
DoubleClick, space permitting. Deficon also creates default icons for these 
different filetypes - it's all very friendly and intuitive once set up.

<P>The standard of the Newicons is really superb (including those from the 
Aminet).  Unlike MWB, there are very few shovelled together Icon sets, with 
the dedication of the artists shown by their intricate designs (thats not to say 
that MWB is full of shovelware - there are also some highly detailed sets for 
that system).  The colours are all bright and vibrant, unlike the mellow tones 
of MagicWB, which has a colour palette of washy-blue, washy-pink and dark-
washy-pink - but still better than C= original efforts!!  

<P>I've always believed that you can tell when an icon is correct for the job if 
you can almost certainly tell from the icon what the file is - this is especially 
true for Newicons as some images are so detailed you'd swear you're 
running a very high res. Workbench.  There's even a different icon for a PC0: 
disk than a standard AmigaDOS floppy - put in a MS-DOS formatted disk 
(and mount PC0:) and you will get a disk with a windows logo on it.  Its the 
nice touches that count.

<P>Of course, I wouldn't recommend Newicons for users without at least some 
extra memory, and more likely an accelerator and Hard Drive.  I have 
noticed a slight decrease in Workbench performance, mostly in the opening 
of new windows while Newicons decodes the icons.  I only have a mildly 
expanded A1200 (Apollo 1220@28mhz with 4Mb fast RAM & 260mb Hard 
Drive) but there is only mild slow-down.  I would assume that this may 
become excessive on lower spec. machines (although I am using the 
NewIcons "high-end" libraries instead of "crap machine" libraries - I have no 
idea if this makes a difference) especially if memory was in short supply as 
you do need at least a 32 colour Workbench to make full use of the system.  

<P>A hard drive is almost essential - using it from floppy disk would be a 
nightmare for two reasons:

<P>1.  Floppies are slow enough without having to decode images into the 
bargain.
<BR>2.   By the time you have created a bootable disk that runs Newicons, you 
might have space for..er.. emh...The Shell!!

<P>As a typical example of extra disk space used, a normal MWB icon is just 
over 1k in length, while Newicons are usually over 2k, so icons tend to take 
up twice as much room as before.  This may be a worry if you have a drive 
breaching 85% capacity as the Newicons may fill it right up!

<P>Another point I noticed was that a lot of "def_icons" were added to ENVARC: 
and, thus, usually have to be copied over into RAM: on bootup.  Not only 
does this waste precious memory, but would add a few seconds to the 
bootup.  To get round this, I used a program called HappyENV (given away 
on AF a few months back).  It only copies files into ENV: after they have 
been asked for for the first time, thus saving memory in the long run.

<P>Briefly then, DO install Newicons if you think your computer can hack it 
(KS1.3 512k A500s need not apply!!) but DON'T install if you are: low on 
disk space, low in memory, have a poor-spec. processor etc.  To those that 
do install it, I hope you enjoy what is a wonderful and picturesque icon 
replacement package.  All I need know is someone to buy me a copy of 
Dopus Magellan instead of my rather aged 5.11 to get Newicon support!!
