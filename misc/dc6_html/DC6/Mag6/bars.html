<HR>
This is a little survey of some of the bars of different colleges here at Cambridge. This was originally written by 'Virtual 37', a little e-zine done 
me and some friends...
<HR>

<P>The bar at Tit Hall is small. Well, so is everything here, but basically,
they allowed enough room for the bar itself - literally, but forgot to allow
for room for people to get pissed. As such, everyone ends up spilling into
the corridors, upstairs, into the JCR and outside. Service is swift here,
except when the entire population of Tit Hall decides to buy a drink at the
same time. On such occasions, people usually buy several pints for
themselves at once, to make the trip worthwhile. Being small has the
advantage that there is no room for a pool table, although there is a darts
board, which would be very dangerous to play when there were a few people in
there. Oh yes, they are also clinging onto the last known stocks of Rapido
in the universe (superdrink that tastes like refreshers, and has the added
bonus of getting you pissed *very* quickly - or should that be the other way
round?)

<P>Anyway, we got bored of our little haven very quickly, and have taken the
time to check out a great many of the other college bars, and these are some
of our findings...

<P>(btw, if anyone reading here is applying to Cambridge, and isn't sure of
which college to apply for, this guide will prove invaluable. But then
again, I recommend you come to Tit Hall, anyway. As long us you don't go to
the 'other place'.)

<P>Kings bar is cool. I don't know why, but we have spent more time in here
than in our own by far. It's big (Tit Hall bar would fit in here about fifty
times, at least), and the red walls really confuse you when you're pissed.
Lots of interesting people here to meet, and really cool seating
arrangements (like lots of little alcoves). When you're entering Kings, make
sure you go straight to the bar, and don't hang about, or else the porters
will kick you out when they realise you are from another college.

<P>Robinson, another favourite of ours. Robinson looks like a sports centre,
and indeed, the bar looks like that from a sports centre. We were convinced
that there was a swimming pool next door, but it turned out to be the formal
hall. But even so, I swear one of these days I will turn up carrying towel
and swimming trunks, and ask the barman where the changing rooms are.

<P>Newnham is one of the all-girl colleges, but you wouldn't have guessed it
from the bar. Actually getting into the college is near impossible; not
because of really strict porters not letting males in (that isn't the case),
rather, finding the entrance itself is quite a task.

<P>New Hall, the other girly college, and this one is not like Newnham. Keypad
locks on all the doors, and the porters will turf out any males on sight
after about 10pm. The one time we actually made it to the bar, it was
completely shut, and empty. And this was Saturday evening...

<P>Fitz. Don't remember much of this place, due to the altered state of
conscious I was experiencing at the time, but it seemed pretty lively in the
main bar. There's also a nice 'chill out' room, you can even attempt to look
sober by pretending to read the newspapers scattered there. One thing to
watch out for, though, is the 'killer door'. It lets you in nicely, but when
you try to leave, it swings back viciously. That, and the step you also have
to negotiate is too much to cope with, and you'll be knocked to the ground,
believe me.

<P>Clare bar is tucked away underground, the bops here must be excellent. It's
also pretty good to be watching outside when a bop is on; being below ground
level, you only see the tops of these windows poking about the ground, and
you just see these lights flashing from below the surface. Also the only
place to have a free pool table, although I consider this a downer, in that
it encourages pool playing as opposed to drinking. Why can't they charge two
quid for the pool table, and give out free drinks...

<P>Emma is a nice bar, very big, two levels, and nicely semi-circular in shape.
The barmen try to scare you by saying you can only drink here if you are
signed in by a member of the college, but then they say 'Sod It', and you
can buy a pint anyway.

<P>Trinity. Oh dear. The number of official looking 'Only Trinity students will
be served here' splattered everywhere is scary. Having such a huge number of
students here is a problem too, as there isn't enough beer to go round.
Indeed, when we were there, they had run out completely - but never fear,
they had plenty of cans in stock...

<P>Christ's. We entered the bar, and said 'Christ's! This bar is even smaller
than Tit Hall's', and then left.

<P>Caius. We haven't 'properly' checked out the bar, we just gatecrashed their
70's night during Freshers' Week. Unfortunately, we gatecrashed right at the
end, and only caught the song 'Dancing Queen' - a song that I never liked
before, but I am now addicted to, I might add.

<P>John's bar we haven't yet been to, due to the maximum security in force to
prevent outsiders like me getting inside. Your only hope is to know someone
who is at the college, who can then try to smuggle you in via a secret
entrance. According to sources, there is a particular type of very-nice beer
there, which is only for sale at one other place in the world.

Hey! It's the return of The Great Pub Survey, specially adapted for College
Bars (most V37 readers will know what I'm on about, but readers of
DoubleClick won't have a clue).

<P><B>Notes</B>
<UL>
<LI>*1 - For having Rapido (would be 4/4 without it)
<LI>*2 - Would be 10, save for E H Boptastic
<LI>*3 - Think of a sports centre bar...
<LI>*4 - Well, it was very dark...
<LI>*5 - So they don't get any points
<LI>*6 - It's true! Trinity has a college cat!
<LI>*7 - Estimated for a non-bop night. Extra bonus for playing 'Dancing Queen'
<LI>*8 - We have heard rumours of a parrot, but only rumours, mind.
