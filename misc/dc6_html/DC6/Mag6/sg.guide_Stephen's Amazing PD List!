                      +------------------------------+
@{fg text}
With  this guide, as I am very generous,  I wanted to include  a  Free
Game,  for all to play.  It is Poing 4,  which must be one of the best
Breakout,  or Bat & Ball games this side of the Northern Hemisphere! I
play  it  to  death,  and I am writing to the programmer of  the  game
concerning  registration,  and if he can  supply  me  with  a  way  or
merging  highscore tables.  Don't try and change them,  as the  tables
are  in binary and are protected anyway.  Highscores are saved as soon
as  they  are entered,  although I doubt you will need to worry  about
that  for a while,  on most levels anyway, so please do  keep the disk
write enabled!  

If  you do get a highscore,  send me a copy of the table,  and I  will
make  a  file in this guide of all the highscores I receive.  Pressing
escape to finish the game will return you to this guide.  You will  of
course  have to stop the music playing in the background first.   This
can  be  done by pressing both mouse buttons.  The actual  game  files
have been Powepacked by me so that they would fit on the disk,  as  it
is now 100% full,  so I have had to cut some corners. This will result
in  a  slight delay in loading,  although once loaded there is no more
files that need to be accessed, so there will be no more delays.

Sorry,   but  you will already have the game by now.  When  I  send  a
replacement  guide,  I usually send just the document in  Lha  format,
along with other archives for you to use.  This way,  I can send  more
to  you  on the disk.  If you want,  you can take this guide and  just
copy it onto the disk I sent you originally,  although due to the size
of  this  document,  you will have to use Powerpacker  to  crunch  the
guide, as there is no way that it will fit onto the disk unpacked.

I  am sorry,  but as this guide has been included in Doubleclick!,  we
have been unable to supply it with the free game as promised,  due  to
space  restrictions on the disk.  There is a simple remedy.  Write  to
me,  and swap some disks,  and tell me that you want the game Poing 4,
from the Cat Disk.  I will then supply you an Lha file of the game, as
well as the latest version of this guide.

                 | News For February 1998 |
                 +------------------------+
@{fg text}
Hello there and welcome to the February 1998 Issue of the disk.

Hello's this month go to (in no particular order):

		@{"    Ragnar Fyri     " link mesragnar}
			@{"    Mark Harman     " link mesmarkh}
				@{"    Geoff Aitken    " link mesga}
					@{"    Chazz Trager    " link meschazz}
				@{"   Stephen J Ryan   " link messjr}
			@{"  Ian Charles Fyvi  " link mesicf}
		@{"Amicom Public Domain" link mesami}

I  have added a few questions on my questionnaire,  that most,  if not
all  of you will have filled out.  If you could fill the new one  out,
and send it back to me,  then I would be very grateful. Think of it as
a  yearly registration!  Also,  thanks to the people who have  already
returned  their's - all of the new details have been  added.   I  must
add, however, that not many people are taking advantage of the section
I  have  on  the questionnaire where you have the chance to  write  an
advert that I can put in the guide,  along with your details.  It is a
service  for you after all,  of which I am not charging -  I  am  also
quite lenient, so go ahead and use it - that is what it is there for!

I  have been having problems with the Diskspare device that I recently
installed.   I can use my own disks OK,  but many of my  penpals  have
been sending me different versions of the device,  all of which cannot
read each other's disks.  Major problem.  The solution that I came  up
with  is  to suspend using it until I get a version that  I  am  happy
with,   and that will use most of the different versions I  have  come
across so far.

You will notice that the Compilations section is a bit different,   as
it now only lists names.  This is to save space on the guide, as there
is  no point in typing in the same description twice,  is there?  This
also means that there will be a lot of new entries into the guide,  as
I  am now getting stuff from the Aminet regularly.  Stick with me,  as
all will be fixed soon.

There has been a decrease in the amount of mail I am getting,  and  to
be honest - I am glad, as it is letting me catch up on a lot of things
- just ask Mark Harman!  I have LOADS to do for the magazine, and I am
glad  for  the  small  holiday,  as November / December  was  absolute
bedlam, although I hope things pick up next month. Keep writing.

Also,   another plea to readers,  I have just got hold  of  an  A500+,
which  is  running OK through my video,  but I can only use  the  Mono
socket, as I did not get an RF Modulator with it. Can anybody help?

I am also still looking for a Z88 connecting cable.  I have had a few,
which have been close, but the Amiga end had 23 pins instead of 25, or
the  Z88 end was a socket instead of a plug.  Never fear - I will  get
it  done  eventually,  so that I can write letters when I am  out  and
about,  be it in the car,  on the train - whatever. Obviously, I would
not  write  letters in the car while I am moving - that is just  plain
daft.

I  was thinking of sending the Contacts section of this guide to Amiga
Format,  for inclusion in their CD,  in the Reader Ads section.   They
did  ask  if you wanted to,  that you could send in an Amigaguide.   I
have  made  a  stand  alone Amiga guide of this  senction,   which  is
available  from me anytime.  If you think this is a good  idea,   then
please let me know.  It would be nice to hear your views either way. I
would  suppose that this would be OK,  as your details appear on  this
guide anyway,  and I know that quite a few people get it now, as it is
distributed with Issues of Doubleclick!

Hear from you soon,

Still waiting for the finished version of your anims - I await them
eagerly - they really are worth the wait!

Also,  thanks for your recent E-Mails.  Alan, my brother, who you also
talked to,  managed to get a picture of you,  which we took from  your
Web Page.  If you want to see what Alan looks like (prepare yourself),
then go to URL: http://members.tripod.com/~Alan_Graham/ and you should
be  able to download a picture of him.  I might even get a picture  of
myself on there sometime - we shall wait and see.

Well,   we did it.  Doubleclick!  issue 5 was released in 1997 (just),
and not the year after,  as I had thought.  Still working hard on  the
DC6 anims, and will E-Mail them to you as soon as they are done.

Expect a VERY VERY long letter soon (well,  now in fact,  as you  will
have got it with this disk).

Yes,  I know - Sorry,  Sorry,  Sorry about the delay.  Your letter has
been lying in my out tray (well,  ice cream box) for quite a while. My
excuse  is  that I was going to wait until I had DC5 to give  to  you.
Blame  somebody else,  the weather,  the price of butter,  the  postal
system,  just don't blame me too much.  You will notice that there  is
an  extra disk in the package.  You should find some new stuff on  it.
hear from you soon.

                    | Information About Stephen Graham |
                    +----------------------------------+
@{fg text}
Hello.  My name is Stephen Graham. My birthdate is 14 January 1976 and
I  am  currently  22 years old and I want to get started  in  swapping
disks etc through the mail with other Amiga fanatics, like yourselves.

Here is a list of my computer Setup:
@{b}
A1200 with internal 2½" 260 MB Hard Drive 
Appollo 1220 4 MB Memory Board with 68882 Maths Co-Processor plus Clock
2 External Floppy Disk Drives  
CitizenABC 24 Pin Dot Matrix Colour Printer 
Panasonic KX-P1180 9 Pin Dot Matrix Black & White Printer 
Goliath Upgrated Power Supply 
Wizard Developments Black 3 Button Mouse 
RoboShift Joystick / Mouse Splitter
Camlink Stereo Sound Mixer 
Konix Sppedking Joystick (Which  I have  had  for 5 years!)  
Konix Navigator Joystick 
A600 with 1 MB Trapdoor Memory Upgrade plus Battery Backed Clock
A500+ (But I have no RF Modulator)
Cambridge Z88 Laptop (Soon to have a Connection to the Amiga A1200)
@{ub}
I  have  been  collecting Public Domain for  a  few  years  now,   and
although  my collection is not very large,  (350 ish disks),   I  have
quite a lot of other disks from mags etc,  and friends. I also run the
latest  version  of Virus Checker and Virus Z 2 on startup  to  combat
virus infection.

I  have  been interested in computing from a very early age.  My  very
first  computer was a ZX81 (remember them!)  with a full 16K  upgrade!
Wow!  I had two of them before I upgraded to a ZX Spectrum (the  first
one  with the dead man finger keys!).  From there I bought  a  48K  ZX
Spectrum (The black one with the fold down feet),  and from that a  ZX
Spectrum +2,  which at the time was the cutting edge of technology.  A
whole 128 KB of power.  I also had a Radio Shack TRS-80,  which I only
used for playing chess and Card Games - it was that primitive.  I then
decided it was time for a change,  and bought an A600 with my brother.
Wow!   Programs  that loaded in less than three days,   and  they  had
decent sound and graphics.  I was converted.  I had a shot of friend's
Atari ST, but it was not the same - The Amiga was the one for me!

Soon  after  this  my brother and I,  who owned  half  of  the  Amiga,
decided  to  upgrade  up  to an A1200.  We did  and  since  them  have
expanded  the  system.  We bought the printer first  because  we  were
currently  using  an Epson 9 pin Black & White  and  the  quality  was
quite literally,  crap! We have since bought the Hard Drive (Notice to
all  non-Hard  Drive owners:- GET ONE NOW.  YOU WILL NOT  BELIEVE  THE
DIFFERENCE!),  and we are currently saving up for a CD-ROM,   a  Sound
Sampler and an Colour Inkjet Printer.

I also own a Cambridge Z88 Laptop computer, which is handy to type out
your letters when you are out and about,  or away from home. I am just
about  to  buy  a  cable that connects the Z88 to  your  Amiga.   It`s
something I`ve wanted for a long time.  Eventually, I got it. All good
things  come to those who wait.  I also have a Phillips CDi  with  the
Digital  Video  Cartridge,  lots of films and  games  etc.   It  is  a
brilliant machine to play with.  Does anybody else have one, and would
like to swap tips etc about games, and maybe even some discs?

I  am  now also a Co-Editor for Doubleclick!,  the Amiga disk magazine
produced  regularly  by Pentrisoft.  It is freely  available  from  PD
Libraries,   as  well  as Pentrisoft,  Amicom PD,   Mark  Harman  (The
Pentrisoft  President),  as well as myself.  A worthy read  which  has
loads of articles to suit just about any taste.

I  work  in the mornings delivering newspapers with my brother.  After
that  I work as a mechanic in my father`s garage,  fixing cars.   From
time to time I am a DJ,  who runs his own mobile disco (which was paid
for  out of the paper round - think of the price of CD`s and equipment
etc).

My  main  interests  are  Cars,  for obvious reasons,   Computing  and
Motorcycling.   I  want  anything  you  like  on  the  disks,   Demos,
slideshows,   games,  utils,  you name it,  I want  it.   All  letters
answered 1200%.

Thanks for watching, and send me your jiffys.

As  you  can see,  you can now E-Mail me.  Put my name in the  Subject
Heading,  and send all your stuff (Text,  Mods,  you name it) to my E-
Mail address and I should get it in due time.

Please put my name in the Subject Heading,  so that I will receive the
message.  Any Pirate software posted to this address will result in  a
letter being sent to The Federation Against Software Theft.  This is a
joint  decision between myself and my brother,  as it  is  his  E-Mail
address.  Please also inform me if you want to send PD software  using
this  method,  so that we know to expect E-Mails.  Just  in  case  you
think  I  am  bluffing,  here is the phone number for  FAST:   (01753)
527999.  This is the UK phone number.  You could also take a  note  of
ELSPA's Crime Unit,  who concentrate on Piracy amongst games software.
their  number  is (0990)  133405.  I do NOT deal in pirated  software.
Anyone  that  does send ANYTHING that has a dubious  copyright  on  it
shall not be replied to.  As well as this,  your details may be  shown
in  this guide,  and remember,  that this guide does find it's way  to
Amiga  Format  and CU Amiga - I send it to them sometimes.   They  may
take it into their heads to make an example of you!  Needless to  say,
you will NOT get a reply via E-Mail.

If  you are sending me anything via E-Mail,  I would appreciate if you
could  first send a message requesting a reply,  telling us  what  you
wish  to  send.  Obviously,  as time goes on,  and we swap via  E-Mail
regularly, this will not be required.

I would like all files to be sent as an Lha archive,  although this is
not essential,  if it is a single file,  but always (if possible),  if
you  are sending a batch of files.  If you cannot use Lha,  then  tell
me,  and I shall send you easy instructions on how to use it. Also, if
you  are sending me files via E-Mail,  all files must NOT exceed  700K
in  size,  due to the restrictions using CrossDOS on the Amiga,   plus
the fact that HD disks do not work on Amiga computers.

@{fg text}
I found that after writing off to a few PD Libraries, they all stocked
roughly the same thing. I thought that if I wrote to the magazines and
advertised my disk in the PenPals and small Ads section,  people would
write to me, having had the same dealings with PD Libraries. I want to
make  it clear that I am NOT a PD Library,  just someone who does  not
want  to  lose  the Amiga.  I am not charging money for  this,   I  am
treating this the same way as you would writing to a penpal.   If  you
had  a  penpal and he sent you a tape or CD etc,  you would not expect
to  pay  for it.  This is not to say that money received will  not  be
appreciated.  If you feel I should get money for what I am doing  then
don`t let me stop you.  I also did this guide for the challenge,   the
sheer  hell of it,  and really because nobody has even tried something
like this before!

This guide undergoes constant updating to make it easier to read, with
better links,  more information about the software, an updated Penpals
Section,  and better Text Effects to make it a more enjoyable read.  I
thank you for taking the time to put all my hard work to some use.

Amicom PD - Thanks for the last order, you  really are  hyper fast.  I 
	    received the order before  I sent it! You really must  eat 
	    your Weetabix  in the morning!  Anyway,  thanks must go to 
	    all  at  Amicom, Kevin,  Ian,  Sue and  all the Amigas for 
	    taking the time to look at my disk.  It has not been a big
	    waste of time after all. You said that if you had the time
	    that you would phone me. I keep missing you, so  you  gave 
	    me your home phone number, which I will just write here to
	    see if it is OK - (01234)  567890.  I will not give it out 
	    as I know what it  is like when you having people  phoning 
	    you up when you do not want to listen to them.  I will try 
	    and phone you sometime.  Bye!! Sorry about the size of the 
	    last order.  I really did get a bit  carried away. Anyway,   
	    that  will be me for about 10 minutes, before I  send  you
	    another order. Write to you soon.

Alan,   my  brother  - As I am writing this,  he  is  in  my  bedroom,
		       watching a film on my video,  as I am using the 
		       computer, in  his room, and he  cannot use  his 
	               video as I am here.  Thanks for the time on the
	               computer (we usually share the time).

All  the  people who work for the National Grid - Keeping me  supplied
						  with electricity.

All  the Octamed composers - For writing all the Modules that  I  have
			     in my collection.  There are far too many 
			     people to thank by name.

Commodore - For inventing the Amiga in the first place!

Mark  Harman  -  Mark is the author of Doubleclick,  A brilliant  disk
		 magazine  to  which I regularly  contribute,  as I am 
		 a  Co-Editor.  He works hard at it and deserves  lots 
	         of credit for the work he has done so far.

Andrew  Whiteley  -  Not  only did he write  Remdate,   the  excellent
		     Organiser program, he  also saved  my Hard  Drive 
		     from extinction  a while  back. VERY helpful, and 
		     must be mentioned. Thanks a lot, Andy.

Many more people who I know & love, but have forgotten to mention!

Here  is a list of the Public Domain Disks I have.  It is sorted  into
alphabetical  order,  so any new titles will be  in  there  somewhere.
Sorry,   it  would have been easier to just list  new  titles  at  the
bottom,   but it would have been harder to search for any titles  that
you  think I may have.  I cannot say what these programs will run  on,
as  I  only own an A1200 and an A600,  so if the program is 1.3  only,
then  there is a chance that I will not have it,  or if I do,  I  will
say that you must use Kick 1.3 to run it.  It is wise to get a copy of
this  disk as it will no doubt pay for itself in no time at  all.   To
browse through the list,  just click on the letter you require, and it
will be displayed.  This feature was suggested by Paul Lathwell,   the
author  of Address Print,  and Onform.  This is to aid the  reader  in
finding a specific program.

101 Uses For A Dead Cat - Sick! 101 pictures (funnnily enough) of dead
                          cats drawn  in  High  Res,  Black  &  White.  
			  Some of  them are  quite  funny, but most of

2  Meg  Walker Demo (2 disks)  - Demo of Spacewalker from  Star  Wars.
				 Good!

256 Colour - Sort out any clashing colour problems.  Resets to the

3  Games  -  Worms,   Go Karts and PANG clone.  Also  prog  to  toggle

             are much better.

4 Wins - Connect Four on you WB Screen.

600 Busines Letters - Lots of text files for lots of business purposes

                         graph makers and a program to print out a CV.

6th  Form Lovers (2 Disks)  - Pictures of two girls,  who,  let's say,

A Taste Of U4iA - A not bad demo with the usual effects.

AB3D2ED - Editor for levels etc on Alien Breed 3D 2.

Abnormalia 5 - Issue 5 of the pretty good Disk Mag.  The graphics  are
               on a par with  Grapevine, as is the music,  but most of 
	       the articles are all  about scene  stuff on  the Amiga.  
 	       Some of it is interesting, though.

Action Replay IV - Find all the cheats in those games!

Address Book - Remember where your mates stay,  Comes complete with  a
               telephone dialler too.

                 too. Written by Paul Lathwell of Onform fame!

Addresser - Print out nice address labels etc.

Adventure Game Writer - Speaks for itself I suppose!

Age Of Rock - I got this game from an Amiga Format coverdisk,  and  it
	      is totally awesome!  This is one great Tetris clone with 
	      a difference, where you have to shoot at the blocks. The 
	      first two levels are easy, but wait until you get to the 
	      fourth level, where you  have to try  to use the keys to 
	      control two different game screens at the same time, not 
 	      so easy.  This game is of commercial quality,  and it is 
	      just a shame that the market has got to the stage  where 
	      the only games that seem to sell are  the ones where you 
	      shoot people and / or the nasty aliens with as big a gun 
	      as you can carry.  Games like this are sadly missed, but  
	      thanks to PD, this is not the case!

AlbinMUI - A great database for all your music albums.  Requires MUI
           installed.

Alphaspell - This will spellcheck any ASCII text.  User Dictionary  as
             well.  

Ambassador Fruit Machine v2.0 - I played this for about 3  hours  last
                                night!  Very good graphics  and sound.  
			        This is very  much fun to use,  thanks 
				for asking!

AmBasicHelp - Some helpful information for Amiga Basic Users.

AmiCDFS2 - Well known and used CD filing system for the Amiga.

		       that you will know, and very well presented.

	    Ragnar Fyri.  This  is definitely  worth a  look.  Totally 
	    amazing.  200  frames of sheer  joy! (Did I  sell it  hard 
	    enough, Ragnar?)

Amiga  Test - Make sure that your trusty box of chips is not going  to
	      die on you, just as you reach the final  level  in  your 
	      favourite game!

Amigatration - Same as Think A Mania but the graphics are not half  as
	       good.

Amiga  Workbench `85 - Slideshow written by my brother poking  fun  at
		       Microsoft Windows (as if you would need to!).

AmiTCP V3.0b (2 Disks)  - Want a fileserver for the Internet.  You got
			  it!

		Another brilliant Eric Schwartz anim.

Anti Lemmin Demo - Takes ages to load, then you get a disk error!

			 also a speciality!

 		    Well drawn. Made by Amicom PD.

		    moment etc.

Awesome Sounds - Lots of great Modules on this disk. Menu driven.

Axis  /  Picturebook (4 Disks)  - I bought this years  ago,   but  was
				  supplied on HD disks, so I could not 
				  see all of this excellent Graphics & 
				  Music Demo.  This has now been fixed
				  and can be viwed in all it's glory.

	    HDToolbox etc.

Basketball Anim - Good quality Anim of a basketball player  getting  a
		  basket, drawn using Imagine.

Batman - Slideshow from the animated Batman cartoon. Excellent.

BBC  Emulator - Why people would want to turn their Amigas into a  BBC
		Micro really does confues me. Still, some people are a

Balders Grove - A Boulderdash style game.

Barbi Twins Volume 1 - Some great pictures of those great sisters.

		      find information on what you are looking for.

			probably get a much better card at the  end of

CDROM-WB - Boot up your CD ROM From WB.

Caboom - Makes your windows "explode".  Yes, it does, and it is great,
	 but it takes up far too much  processor time, and makes  your 
	computer ssllooww right down.  Better to use Zoomwindows.

Cachefont  -  Are you annoyed with the time that Font  lists  take  to
	      load? Worry no more, as this program  will solve all  of 
	      your probems. There are  two programs  in this  archive,  
	      one that  makes  a  list of all  your  fonts, which  you  
	      must run every time you add or  delete  a  font from the
	      directory (which is not very often), and one for listing 
	      the fonts, so  that  every  time  a  call for  a list of 
	      fonts  is  used  (Personal  Paint  etc),  this  list  is 
	      displayed in triple quick time.  If, like  me, you  have
	      MCP installed, you could also  use that, as it  has this 
	      option as well.

Clock - Wow,  a clock for the WB,  how original.  This one however has
	the  best  graphics  you are ever likely to see for  an  Amiga  
	clock.  Written  by a TV Station programmer  in Greece,  it is 
	run 24 hours a day, and  changes the picture  to coincide with 
	the time of day.  The  only problem  is that you  have to type 
	CTRL C to  quit the program. Other  than that, this  is a  top
	notch  program,  which I  use quite  often, and  the  graphics
	alone are something to talk about.

Club Mix 2 - More Octamed songs to listen to.

Code Mungus - A Highway Code test for all you learner drivers.

Colour Cars Clipart - Speaks for itself.

Diskmatter - 

Disksalv2  -  Anybody who does NOT have this deserves  all  they  get.
	      This program is an invaluable one to have in your box of
	      disks.  It will sort out most  problems  regarding  duff 
	      disks, and  it was the last PD version  made  before the 
	      programmers decided to make it a commercial product.

Diskspare - This is a set of DOS drivers,  that allows you  to  format
	    Double Density floppy disks to 960K (FFS), and 913K (OFS). 
	    I use this system for my archive disks,  and yes,  folks - 
	    it works,  and it works well! This  is the system that was 
	    used on the AUI coverdisks, before they stoppped making it
	    due to people not buying the mag, which was a shame, as it
	    was a great mag.

Dissect  V1.7 - Take all your games to bits to find cheats.  Difficult
		to use, but may be rewarding for some.

Document  File Protector - This util can come in VERY handy.   Uses  a
			   password or a series of numbers to  encrypt 
			   a document file. To decrypt it, you load it  
		      	   into  DFP,  after  first  typing  in   your 
			   password,  BACKWARDS.  If you get it wrong,  
			   the file is encrypted again, and  so on. By 
			   encrypting a  file twice,  you can be  sure 
			   that NO-ONE can read it. Even the FBI could 
			   not break this one!

DoIcon17 - 

Domimium  Demos  1 - First in a set of many of good demos  and  intros
		     etc.

Domimium Demos 9 - More of the same.

		  twice.

		       with many improvements.

Doubleclick! Issue 3 (2 Disks)  - Third in the series of the  excellent
				  disk mags,  which  I have  a hand  in 
				  writing. They are worth every  penny.
				  Now on 2 disks, due to the  number of 
				  articles we have crammed on the disk.

Doubleclick!  Issue 4 (2 Disks)  - After much hard work, it is finally
				   here  -  the best read all  summer.  
				   A must get,  totally  great,  cool,
				   groovy  etc (Have I sold it  enough 
			           yet, Mark?).

Doubleclick!  Issue 4 (The AmigaGuide Version) (2 Disks) - The same as
							   DC4, but in 
a  very  large  Amigaguide document,  but  without  all  the  bells  &
whistles,  just so that our non AGA readers do not feel left out. Yes,
there is a few of them left!

Dragon Tiles - A VERY good "Click on the pairs" game,  Which I have of
	       course registered for. Worth every penny.

Dreamgirls Cardset - Another REKO Cardset of nice females.

Drink  &  Drown - An adults only game,  where you enter a bar,  answer
		  some questions, get to swear a lot, fall down drunk,   
		  throw up, generally  act like a prat. Will  probably 
		  keep you amused for a while, until  it is time to go
		  to the pub!

Drums & Pipes - Songs full of drums and pipes funnily enough.

Dysk  Stik  V1.1  - Brill disk label printer from Paul Lathwell,   the

Heddley - Make your own Amigaguide documents. Fantastic!

	       enemy!

Humour - Funny pictures on a disk.

Hydro Zone - Remember Star Wars at the end (Death Star)? Get the idea?

Kefrens Dane - Excellent Music Demo.

Kefrens  Desert  Dream  (2 Disks)  - Another excellent  offering  from
				     the brilliant Kefrens.

Kefrens Interchange - Advert for a forthcoming Kefrens Demo.

Keyquick  -  Pretty crappy Typing tutor.  I have ordered  another  one
	     that I have heard is much better.

Kick It (A Day For The Laiban)  - This game is seriously strange.  You
				  are a naked man, and you have to try
				  and wander  through  the  woods, and 
			          zombies walk up to you,  wanting  to 
				  grab your private parts! You have to 
				  kick them in  the face  before  they 
				  get you.  Strange and humourous game
				  and the graphics and music are  very
				  good,  and  would not  shame a title
				  that was commercial.
 
Klondike V1.1C - The original patience card game. Does not need AGA.

Klondike 3 AGA (4 disks)  - Excellent patience card game. Needs 2 MB &
			    Hard Drive!

Machine Anim - Another good Animation.

Mad Elks / Technologic Death - Brilliant, and I mean this, Techno demo
			       with some really truly magical effects,  
			       and no swearing,  except for some right 
			       at the end, which is  unusual for demos
			       these days.

Madhouse - Brilliant Screen Blanker. I use it myself.

Magic  Card  Tricks  - Tells you how to perform 3 magic  card  tricks,
		       strangely enough!

Magic  Eye - Another great WB gadget where two eyes follow the mouse's
	     (mice?) every move.

MagicTV  -  Brilliant utill I use a lot for Wordworth etc.  Will  stop
	    the flicker of High Res Interlace screens of 16 colours or  
	    less.   I tried  it and it works, although not on my WB as 
	    this is a 32 colour one.  Worked a treat on Wordworth  and 
	    PPaint though. A 32 colour version will be available soon,  
	    as I E-Mailed the programmer, and he has said he will send 
	    it to me when it is done.  I have seen a  Beta copy of it,
	    and it looks promising.

MagicWebMaker - Make that great Web Page that you always wanted.

Magnetic Pages V1.3 - Disk Mag Maker.  Will play with it and tell  you
		      later what I think of it.  If it is good  enough 
		      to use, I may create a regular diskmag, to which 
		      you lot can even contribute to.  Grapevine  look
		      Out!  you  could of course, just  write to me at
		      my address for stuff that you want to send in to 
		      Doubleclick!

Magnum V1.7 - Disk mag creator which looks like Grapevine. NOT!

Makepath - 

Manic Raves (2 Disks) - lots of rave music to listen to.

Maped - Make maps for all you adventure game writers.

Master Blaster - Brilliant Super Bomber Man clone.

MasterMind - Guess the colour of the 4 balls the computer has picked.

Maximum Overdrive - Demo which needs HD.

Mayhem On Wheels 3 - Small anims of car crashes. Can also be viewed in
		     Deluxe Paint. Mega Tron - Snakes style game.

MCP - The ultimate add on for WB.  Can do just about anything,  and  a
      little bit more! Well worth it.  This is a program that you must
      get, and I even use it myself, so it must be good!

Megaball - Arkanoid clone.

Memspeed - Same as Memspeed2 but an earlier version.

Memspeed2 - Check how fast your Amiga is really going.
 
Menu Master - Create your own menu systems.

MenuStay - Brilliant programs to make menus stick to the screen.

Messy Sid V3 - Like MessyDos for the PC.

Metrolink  - Modules inspired by the Manchester Metrolink train.   Not
	     bad anyway.

Micro  Phone Number Locator - Type in the STD code and find out  where
			      it is!  Wow, except that you can type in 
			      the full telephone number and this magic
			      program will even tell you what town  it 
			      is in!

Mind Games - Games to get the greay cells going. About 30 in all.

Mindguard  -  Dont ask me what this does.  I cannot even  explain  it.
	      Something about having a hapy day.  Best thing is to get 
	      a copy of it and try to explain it to me!

Mis - 

MLP Modules - More Octamed Modules of top quality.

MMBCommodity  - Found any uses for the middle mouse button,   all  you

		for you.

Monopoly - Same as one before but different!!????

Monsters - Platform Game.

Monty Python Anim (2 Disks)  - Brilliant Anim by a 13 year old of  the
			       sketch "How not to be seen". Very funny 
			       indeed. The samples are also excellent.

			     disk is LHA`d.

Mr  Men Olympics - Very good choice now that the olympics are  on  the
		   TV.  Lots of different events where you are  one of  
	   	   the  Mr  Men competing. You must get this, just for
		   the graphics alone - it is excellent.

MRBackup Pro V2.2.0 - Backup those floppys & more.

MS Claendar - Nice WB Calendar and Memory Monitor.

Multiplex  V1.1 - Slide the square around the mixed up  picture  until
		  the picture is fixed style game.  Also included is a  
		  file called GRID.IFF, which can load into any  paint

		  as a puzzle.

Music Compilation - Disk like one that is listed above this one!

Music Compilation Disks (S.  Graham) - These are disks that I compiled
				       that are  crammed full  of  the

Nester Card Game - Brilliant "Find the pairs" Card Game.

Newicons - Some people do not like this system of icons for  WB.   The
	   main Amiga magazine CD's seem to, and so do I, which is why 
	   I have it.  It will NOT overwrite your old icons -  it just
	   adds to them.  Quite  a nice  way to  tidy up  your screen, 
	   although it can be a bit hungry on memory.

New Mods - Batman and 2 other Octamed Mods.

New Stealthy Animations - Funny little plane anim. Short but good!

NewTed - Newest version of TED, the Blitz Basic 2 Text Editor.

NFA  Pd Pak #5 - Music Rippers,  card games,  loads and loads on  this
		 disk.

No Limits - Mod of the 2 Unlimited song! No lyrics!

Noisome - Want some funny noises every time you do something.  You got
	  it!

Not  The  Nine O'Clock News (2 Disks)  - Audio sample of the  Gorrilla
					 sketch.

Notebook - Notes for your Amiga. Very advanced. Have up to 5 different
	   notebooks open.

Now Music 15 - Lots of good Modules on this disk.

NT Modules 2 - A selection of about 15 NT modules.

NTSC Mode - Change your screen to NTSC mode. Warning: Some TV's cannot
	    display NTSC modes,  and your computer display will crash.  
	    Luckily my TV can display it!

Numtris  -  Tetris  with numbers.  This game is  so  addictive!   Time
	    limited. Do  what I did and send your money away  for  the 
	    full version.   It  is worth it.

Octamed Samples 2 - Here we go again.

Octamed Samples 3 - More of the same.

Octamed Samples 4 - Even more of the above.

Octamed  Tutor - Mods by ABBA on this disk.  Worth  it  for  the  Mods
		 alone.

OJ  Simpson  (The  Trial)  - A very well put together  disk  about  OJ
			     Simpson.

Onform V1.1 - This is a very good AMOS written Invoice and Order Util,
	      which I have just registered for. Very easy to use,  and 
	      a good quality printout.  Very professional. I hope that 
	      Paul Lathwell, the author of the  program is reading all
 	      this.  Nice one Paul, keep up the good work, and  please 
	      do try  and answer my  letter.  All of my other  Penpals 
	      would maybe like to try your programs.

Oracle  -  Nothing to do with the ITV teletext service  (is  it  still
	   called Oracle?). This is all about horse racing statistics.  
	   Does not really pull my chain,  but someone out there  must 
	   have a use for it. If any  money is won through use of this 
	   util, then I want a cut!

Ooze - Another othello style game.

Ozone "Swamp Thing" - Music Demo of the popular chart hit.

Pal / NTSC Swapper - Change from PAL to NTSC and back again.

Parnet (2 Disks) - Gonna get myself connected!

Parnet Instructions - Disk to tell you how to get yourself connected!

Password  -  Make sure that the younger brothers and sisters  in  your
	     house cannot load in all  those naked  pictures of Pamela 
	     Anderson  that you have stashed away  in your Hard Drive.

PC Task V3.10 - Convert your Amiga into a PC. A very slow PC at that.

PC Tools - As it says. Converts into a PC Dos tool.

PD Games Compilation (Stephen Graham)  - At present there are 11 disks
					 that I have compiled that are 
					 stuffed to the limit with all 
					 of the PD Games that I had on 
my Hard Drive before I had to clear it out due to a lack of space.   A
full  list of all of the contents of the disks can be loaded from  the
Contents.

Pendle Europa Music Modules - Well presented disk of tunes.

Pengo - Get this! It cannot be explained. It is very very good.

Personal  Paint Icons - This is an Arexx script which  allows  you  to
			edit icon files using Personal Paint V6.3  and 
		  	above. Excellent!

Petrol Engine - First in a long line of excellent engine animations.

Pezzas Games - 3 Excellent Games. 2 card ones and something else.

Phantom - Brill Space Invaders Game.

Phone  Locator - This is a brilliant program.  Not only does  it  tell
		 you  the  area that the STD code covers,  but type in 
		 the full phone number,  and it will also tell you the 
		 area of the STD code that the number comes from.   It 
		 is useful  if one  STD code covers  many towns,  like
		 most of them!

Phone & Post Codes - Finds all UK STD code AND Town Post Codes!

Pick - Very good program. Reads a random line from an ASCII Text File.
       Wow,  say you,  what good is that? Quite good,  if you can then 
       program the computer to act on that line.  Let's  say that  the 
       text file has a list of pictures.  Pick will select  one of the
       pictures.   With a  little AmigaDOS  knowledge,  you could then 
       assign that picture to a string  variable,  which you  can then 
       instruct a picture viewer like PPShow, to display.  If all this 
       was put in the startup sequence you could have a random Startup 
       Screen every time you booted up!

Pick  Out  - Meant to be a good card game but it does not load  on  my
	     computer easily!

Picture Menu - Yet another WB program launcher.

Picture Puzzle - Select a picture. Select a tune. Select the number of
		 boxes.  The picture is split up into boxes, and it is 
		 jumbled up. You swap the boxes about until you end up 
		 back where you started.   Good fun to play.

Piles  'O' Tiles - EXCELLENT match the pairs game.  It's level pegging
		   with  Dragon Tiles, except it may nudge ahead as it 
		   has  more  levels (Full version has 42 levels).

Plait - Patience card game.

Platman - Pacman clone, with a twist.  You can jump, and you move
	  between screens, picking up fruit.

Please Release Me - Brilliant anim of country song. Very Funny!

Plot - Not unlike Polyfit.

Point  Of  Sale  -  Fantastic Demo,  but all the text  is  written  in
		    Francais, but this does not affect  the outcome of
		    the demo - it is still excellent.

Polyfit - Draws funny graphs with lines etc.

Pop Quiz - Hey, pop pickers, what do you know about music?

Poster Print - Wow! Speaks for itself.

Powercalc - Very powerful calculator (hence the name?).  Handy for all
	    you maths people out there.

Powerlogo  V1.3 - Amiga Version of the LOGO Language.  If you  studied
		  Computing at school,  like me,  then  you would have 
		  been taught LOGO which is the language that controls 
		  all the funny looking turtles and  pen plotters  you 
		  see on TV, on Blue Peter etc.

Print A Card - Make your own Birthday cards etc.

Printmaster - Do fancy things with your printer.

Pro Bingo - AMOS written Bingo Game, Quite good.

Pro Zodiac 2000 - Astrology for your Amiga.

Pub Cat - 

Pub Darts - Brilliant On the oche style game.

Pyrogenic Short Modules - About 20 Mods of good quality on this disk.

Rainboot - Startup util which plays anims, loads screens, whatever.  I

	   through the Aminet (or from me.  If you ask nicely  enough, 
	   I might be able to get the latest ones off the 'Net).

Rainboot PCom - One of the Rainboot programs.

Real Drag - 

Real Time - Monitor what your Amiga is doing.

Red  Dwarf Demo (2 disks)  - Digitised version of short sketch  (White

Red Dwarf Slideshow (2 disks) - piccys of your favourite characters!

Red  Dwarf  Trivia Quiz - Test your knowledge on RD.   Couch  Potatoes
			  Only!

Red  Dwarf  Trivia Quiz Update 2 - Must not be used  with  above  Quiz
				   disk.

Relokick 1.3 - Turn your A600 & A1200 into a A500!  A must  for  older
	       stuff!

Remdate v2.2 - BRILLIANT Diary.  I am just about to register for  this
	       program. It is very, very, very good. I suggest you use 
	       it with a battery backed clock as it saves a you lot of 
	       time. I used it before I got mine with  my memory board
	       and it just is not as  good. This program is very slick   
	       and has loads, and I mean  loads, of  features. A  Must 
	       Get! (Footnote - Do what I have just done, and register  
	       for this most excellent program. It really is worth  it 
	       in the long run.  You will then receive an update  each
	       year which has all holidays, important days etc.).

Remind 1.5 - Some of those yellow Post it notes for your WB screen.

Rename95  - A good one for all you PC users who are at Uni  etc,   and
	    want to download stuff from the  Aminet onto disks,  which 
	    you can use on your Amiga - something I do a lot of.  This 
	    will rename the  files into something better than the PC's 
	    8 letter crap filesystem.

Reorg  -  This is another one for the Must Have list.  When  you  save
	  files on a fresh disk,  everything is saved OK, but lets say 
	  that you delete  a  file from a disk,  and replace it with a 
	  bigger or  smaller file.   The  files saved from now on will 
	  be fragmented all over  the disk, which means the disk takes 
	  longer to  load and use.  Reorg  takes all  the  files,  and 
	  recopies them onto  the disk,  in the  right order,  without 
	  deleting any of them, and  puts all the empty  blocks at the 
	  end of the disk. Brilliant or what?

Reqtools - Newish version of the Req files.

Reset - A command to make the Amiga reset, funnily enough!

Revenge  Of  The  Blob (2 Disks)  - This is a very well  put  together
				    animation of the  Calvin &  Hobbes 
				    characters  where   their  tapioca 
				    pudding fights back!

Reversi 2 - Othello with a different name.

Ripple - Makes lovely rippled screens,  which you can then save as IFF
	 files to use in Personal Paint etc.

Road To Hell - Pretty boring driving game.

Robs Rockers 2 - More NT and Octamed modules.

Rocketz - Gravity Force style game with rendered graphics.

Roobarb & Custard Remix - Yep! You guessed it! Another excellent mod.

Roswell  - Everything you wanted to know about the little green  men's
	   favourite holiday camp. Also has a spooky music module.

Roulette - Lose your money now, and place your bets!

Rush Hour - Control all those traffic jams on your city,  by switching
	    the traffic lights at the junctions. Mad fun!

Santa  And  Rudolph - Brilliant Xmas game.  You are  either  Santa  or
	 	      Rudolph, and you have to shoot ducks with a gun,  
		      while collecting presents, and floating about on 
		      a  balloon.  Sounds  crap  but  it  isn't.   The
		      graphics are out of this world.

Savings  Certificate  Advert  Anim - Remember  the  advert  about  the
				     butterfly  and the frog? Well now 
				     you can watch it on  your  Amiga.   
				     I found it  was best to boot this 
				     disk, and not to try and  load it 
				     via  Workbench, as  it  sometimes
				     tended to crash.

Scorched  Tanks  - Very Very Very GOOD Tank Hunter  game.   Nuke  your
		   enemy.

SCP - 

Scrabble - Different version of one shown above.

Scrabble - Popular board game converted to the Amiga.

ScreenTab - Launch all those programs.  Use this myself,   and  it  is
	    great. This is one if the best Workbench program lanuchers 
	    I have used yet!

Serious  Backgammon - Time limited version of a  fantastic  game  from
		      Tower Software.

Sermouse - Program to convert IBM Serial Mice to work on Amiga`s.

Sexy Women #1 - I wonder what these are pictures of?

Shortmodules 2 - About 20 Mods on this disk.  Some good,  some not  so
		 good.

Showicon - Wow, let me think, what foes this one do?

Show STD - No,  not something you would use at your local clinic,  but
	   something to display the phone codes for a given town.

Sickness Simulator - Very daft samples of people throwing up! Sick!

Simpsons  Icons  -  Loads  of  full colour  icons  of  your  favourite
		    Springfield family.

Skizzo 2 (4 Disks) - More of the spinny vector demos.

Sky Decoder - Diagram telling you how to make a decoder card.  For use
	      with boffins only!

Sleepness Night 3 Utils - Disk full to brim with some brill utils.

Slicer - Make big files not so big.  How? By slicing them up into lots
	 of little files.

Slide Show AGA - AGA piccys of swimsuited girlies!

Slots  -  A  very  well presented Fruit Machine  game,   which  has  a
	  selection  of boards to choose from,  from Babylon 5, to the  
	  normal bars and fruit ones, this is a great game to play.

SmallCalc - Calculator which only adds small numbers.  No, it is quite
	    small on the screen.  No, wait a minute, it does  not take 
	    up much memory.  Yes, that's it!

Smart Trash - Do you want to chuck it out,  or will you keep it at the
	      last minute? This is the program for you.  Controls  the 
	      WasteBasket.

Smovie - Video Titling Program.

Sonic  Drum  Kit - Brilliant util for making drum  loops  for  use  in
	 	   Octamed etc, or for just having a bash around.

Sonix Jukebox #3 - Tunes done on Sonix for your listening pleasure.  I
	           was wondering why  they picked the  title for  this 
		   disk like they  did!  At first I thought  it  might
		   have something to do with a little 	blue hedgehog.
		   By the  way, it is  presented in a jukebox  fashion 
		   and it is the third in the series  of these  disks! 
		   Wow. Amazing or what?

SoundBox - 

Sound Collection 20 - Smus songs to listen to.

Sound Collection 21 - More smus songs to listen to.

Soundtracker - The Tracker making program to beat all others.

Speak Easy - Make your requesters talk!  Requires narrartor.device etc
	     from WB2.04.

Spectrum Emulator (2 disks) - Turn your Amiga into a Speccy. Sad!

Speed! Demo - Demo of 3D Maze game, limited but fun for a short time!

Spelltris - Mad Tetris game.  Instead of making lines with the blocks,
	    you make words.

Spherical  Worlds - A great looking Alien Breed  /  Space  Invaders  /
		    Shoot Em Up Game, with a hint of The Chaos Engine.  
		    This is one great PD title and it is of commercial 
	   	    quality, with great everything.

Splat 2 - This is a bat & ball game, but uses fishes and other strange
	  creatures.  It is very fast  paced and hard, although I  did 
	  manage to finish  the 2nd level  after about 5 minutes,  but 
	  then, I am addicted to these style of games.   This game has 
	  very good graphics etc, and has loads of samples,  from just 
	  about anything, including a good drum loop at the start, and 
	  some speech from the film Robocop.

Splitter - Split large files into not so large files.

Springtime - Brilliant.  I deleted this of my Hard Drive  my  mistake,
	     so I ordered  myself another copy  from Amicom (Brilliant 
	     PD Company - see advert  in  main guide!).  Move around a 
	     3D floor and put  the  spring onto the X. Simple, you may 
	     think. NOT!!!

Starfleet - A space invaders game, not unlike all the rest!

Star Trek Rave Demo - Only for Trekkies! Pretty sad really!

Star Trek Themes (2 Disks)  - A must for Trekkies. Demo with the title
			      music theme from the original Star  Trek  
		              and the title for  The Next  Generation. 
			      Brilliant sound quality.

Star  Wars Artwork - Brilliant Ray Traced Images from Starwars plus  a
		     few more, ie JCB, cars etc. Very good quality.

Starwoids  -  Brilliant  Gravity Power / Space  Invaders  game,   with
excellent Star Wars samples.  This should be a commercial game,  as it
is of that kind of quality.

StartupKey - Enables the user to have a choice of Startup Sequences.

States  Of  Europe  V1.0  - Info about European countries.   Hyperbook
			    format. Very well done.

STD  -  Type  in Phone Code,  find out where it is.  Type  in  a  town
	instead of the code, and you will get the code.

Stealthy 2 - Animation of your favourite plane!

Steam Engine - Even more anims!

Stereopticon - Make Magic Eye Pictures.

Sterling Engine - More great animations!

Stick It 2 - Leave Post It notes all over your WB screen.

Stock Controller Pro V1.2 - Stock control program which is ideal for a
			    small business.  Unfortunately,  I  cannot 
			    get it to  run properly.  It  looks really 
			    brilliant as well,  and possibly does  not  
		            run  on  an  A1200  without  crashing.  It 
			    will load OK and then crash.  I  will have
 			    to investigate further.

Stonecracker - Make files much smaller.  Quite good,  and better  than
	       Powerpacker, but not Lha in  my estimation, which  must 
	       be worth a bit.

Suicide Machine - Absolutely BRILLIANT shoot `em up using the mouse!

Suicide Machine - Funny Op Wolf game. NOT for members of RSPCA etc.

Superballz - A brilliant Marble Madness style game,  where  you  guide
	     your ball to the exit, clicking switches, avoiding spikes 
	     etc, along the  way.  Written in  Blitz Basic, and  it is 
	     brilliant. Also comes with  full  source  code,   and IFF 
	     Graphic  files,  which  you  can  change, although,  this 
	     really is not needed, as there is also a Level Editor.

Super Cars, Bikes & Planes - More excellent piccys of transport.

SuperDisk - Make disks up to 960K,  just like the ones that  AUI  used
	    to  use, before they decided not to publish a magazine any 
	    more.  Oh, how I shall miss them so!

Super Duper - Brilliant disk copier program.  Takes up no room at all.

Super Formatter - Format those disks in the blink of an eye.

Super Obliteration - PANG style game.

Super  Skoda  Challenge - What can I say? Skoda`s racing!   HA  HA  HA
			  HA!!!!

Super Speel, sorry Spell - Nerev hiv ann xcuse fir spealing mistooks!

SuperDuper31 - Disk copier.

Swapmode+ - Change your screens from PAL to NTSC.  Very handy  if  you
	    are running a high res interlace screen on a TV,  like me. 
	    There are a few  problems with some programs crashing with 
	    it, Personal Paint being one of them but none the less, it 
	    is a great program.

Swazinfo - make nice requesters, with not the usual boring text.

Swimsuit Cardset - Lots of girls in swimsuits for Klondike 3 AGA.

Sysinfo  - The original and best System Checker.  Make sure  that  you
	   have all your memory boards installed correctly etc.

		     areas.

T2 Dance Remix - T2 song is meant to be good.  Still trying to get the
	   	 disk to work!

Tango  Advert - Brilliant tune and sample of the advert where the  big

Tetren  -  Written  by Andy Whiteley,  the man  who  brought  you  the
	   excellent  Remdate V2.2,  which  I registered  for,  and  I 
	   suggest that you do the same.  Because I registered for the 
	   program, he gave me a  complimentary copy of his  excellent 
	   game,  Tetren,  which  is  a  most excellent  Tetris clone.  
	   This,  I think is the full  version  of  the game.   I have  
	   written to him,  asking if there  is also a  demo  version,
	   because  you  horrible lot do  not deserve a full  game for 
	   something  you have  not  paid  for,  do  you? Only joking,   
	   I  wrote  to  him  to congratulate him on  writting  such a 
	   brilliant game!

Tetris Pro - Brillinat graphics in this Tetris clone.

Text Unlimited - Lots and lots of jokes on this disk. Worth a read.

			animations, where Mr Potato Head jumps into  a

The ZX File # 1 - A disk magazine for ZX Spectrum Users,  like me, and
		  people who use a ZX Spectrum emulator on their Amiga
		  also like me.  Also has the program MC Master on the 
		  disk,  which prints out  covers  for audio  cassette 
		  boxes. Why it is on there, I do not know.

@{fg text}
Below is a list of songs that I have stored on my Hard Drive.   It  is
not  all of them,  as some of them are not very good and do not  merit
the  disk space.  Here is the list of the modules,  but remember,   to
save  space,  I have Powerpacked the songs,  so if you are using  them
unpacked, they will take up a lot more space:

I  must take the time to thank Alan Hennebery,  a penpal I swap  disks
with,  who lives in Eire.  He has just supplied me with about  50  odd
Octamed Modules,  that I can add to my collection.  I will now have to
add  a  few volumes to my Music Collection Disks.  Thanks a lot  Alan,
all the LHA archives extracted OK.

These are songs that are not necessarily Octamed Modules. If they are,
then that`s Ok,  but some of them,  ie Don`t Miss The Partyline,   are
actually  4 or 5 Octamed Modules strung together.  Even  if  they  are

@{fg text}
For ease of use,  and to save space on my Hard Drive,  I have compiled
some disks that contain most of my Octamed Modules,  with only  a  few
exceptions.   Most of the files are converted to MED & OctaMED  files,
and use SFCD Compression,  as combining these two can cut the size  of
the  files  quite drastically.  Most of them are sorted into different
catagories,   as  they are on my Hard Drive,   although  most  of  the
catagories have to be split up into different disks,  as they  are  so
big.   Because of this,  I think that only Octamed 5  can  load  these
files.  I don't think they load into Soundtracker or Noiseplayer.   If
you  want a particular song in these formats,  tell me and I  will  do
it, but remember to supply the disk as usual.

There are at present 27 Disks in the series.  I will list the contents

I  also  have a 16 disk set,  which contains loads and loads  of  drum
beats,  instruments,  samples,  sampled speech etc.  Also included  is
some Speech samples from Games,  ie Worms,  Mean Arenas, Valhalla etc.
Also  included is 2 disks of Workbench Backdrops as a bonus,   because
they were archived onto the same disks.  What lucky people you are. If
you are interested,  then send me the disks,  and I will copy them.  I
am not really wanting to copy only a few of the disks,  as it is a bit
of  a  pain,  and due to the sheer volume of files on them,  I am  not
going  to list them all here.  If you really want only some  of  them,
then I may be twisted in the right direction, if the bribe is great.

                   +-------------------------------------+
@{fg text}
Here  is  a  selection  of  the disks in my collection  which  are  my
favourites. In it are demos, games, utilities, you name it!


Age Of Rock -this Tetris Clone with a difference has to be seen to  be
beleived! A must get!

Army  Miner  -  A brilliant MineSweeper clone.  You  have  a  grid  of
squares and you click on the grid, working out where the mines are.

Big Time Sensuality - AGA demo with a Bjork soundtrack.  The graphics,
as  is the sound,  are brilliant.  Please note that it is AGA only and
has 2 disks.

Card  Games  Deluxe - Do you not have enough memory  to  run  Klondike
(Like me!)? Do you want to be able to play Videopoker as well? Do  you
want to use the Klondike cards as cardbacks? YES!  Well,  get this.  I
advise  that  you install it to your Hard Drive,  as it speeds  things
up.  You can also play MED modules in the background.  Octamed  5  can
save modules in MED format, so any song will do. (3 disks).

Deluxe  Galaga  -  This  has got to be the best  Space  Invaders  game
around.   Written  by  Edgar Vidal (the  same  man  who  wrote  Deluxe
Pacman),  the graphics are excellent and the game is so addictive.   I
have played it to death,  but I still have not send away the shareware
fee (ooeerr!!). I have both the ECS and AGA versions of the game.

Deluxe  Pacman - Same Guy,  same great game.  Brilliant conversion  of
Pacman, with loads of levels, and ghosts, and power ups etc.

Dialling Codes - Stuck for an STD Code.  Do you know the town but  not
the code.  This will help you.  Type in any town (or code) in Britain,
and  this program will give you the answer.  Sorry Alan,  but I  don't
think that this program covers Eire.  Belfast is in it,  but Dublin is
not.

Doubleclick  Disk Magazines - As a contributor to these magazines,   I
feel that this is a bit biased,  but they really are brill.  Loads  of
stuff  in  them,   and they are on a par with the legendary  Grapevine
series.  I will of course have the latest version of the magazine. Now
that  they  are  viewed using AWeb3,  they are just getting  better  &
better.

Fast  Intro Maker - Make jazzy intros and bootblock intros  with  this
great  program.  I have sent away for the full version to  Deutchland,
but I have not had a reply back yet.

GuiArc  -  Expand  and dearchive all those programs on  your  magazine
disks.  Brilliant program.  I have used it for ages. Worth it's weight
in gold, about 57p as a disk does not weigh all that much!

Grapevine Mags - These are BRILLIANT!!!!!!  I have every issue from 15
onwards and I have a few early ones as well.  Very funny and very well
put together. I wish they would come back.

Jesus  On E's - Excellent Rave Demo.  All the others try to copy  this
one!   Takes seconds to load,  but about 30 minutes to play.  The  bad
thing  is that it is not HD installable and you must have and external
drive  to  use it.  Get one if you don't have one as you do  not  know
what you are missing. (2 Disks).

Kefrens  Desert  Dream - Dazzling Demo from Kefrens.   Set  in  Cairo,
Egypt in 1993,  is has a story at the start and lots and lots of great
effects by the end.  2 disks to this one,  but you can put the  second
disk  in df0:  when asked,  but it spoils the demo if you have  to  be
asked.

Kick  1.3  -  A  MUST GET!!  You need to get this to be able  to  turn
WB2.04 and upwards machines into a WB1,3 machine. Excellent program.

Motorola  Invaders  - AGA Space Invaders with a Metallica  soundtrack!
Very good graphics and sound. (2 Disks).

Numtris - Tetris with numbers. I registered for this game, as it is so
good.  Unfortunately,  I would be breaking the law if I gave  you  the
full version,  so I won't!  You have blocks with numbers on them which
fall into the pit.  Add up the colums in the pit to the number printed
on  the  bottom,   without  going over that  number,   and  the  colum
disappears.  On the left of the screen is the tiles left counter. When
it reaches zero,  you have completed the level.  It starts at 200.  On
the demo version,  the game ends when the counter reaches 100,  but it
still is a hard game, especially on the later levels.

OJ Simpson (The Trial) -  Lots of info about OJ. Text, pictures, sound
samples - you name it. Very well put together.

Please Release Me - My favourite animation at the moment.  For all you
country music lovers, the song sung by a ballon. Very funny.

Quick  LHA  - I use this program every day,  for packing and unpacking
LHA archives,  easily, and most importantly, quickly. Also handles LZX
etc.

Remdate - This is a serious bit of kit.  It is a Diary and Planner for
your Amiga.  I would recommend that you have a battery backed clock, a
hard  drive,  and maybe some extra memory.  A lot to ask,  but  it  is
worth it.  You can input Birthdays, Special Days, Holidays, use like a
simple  diary to say what you did.  It also has a things to  do  list,
can  print  calendars,  pick lottery your lottery numbers,  absolutely
anything!  This is why I had to register for this program.  It is well
worth  the  slightly more than usual registration fee of  ten  pounds,
but in my view, it is money well spent.

Serious  Backgammon - Another game I will be registering.  Time  Limit
version  (5 Minutes)  of the popular board game.  Graphics  etc.   are
brilliant.   Tetris  Pro  -  I am a Tetris  Pro  Pro!   This  game  is
excellent!!  As you finish the lines,  a picture is revealed. Show all
the picture and the level is complete.  Some of the pictures are worth
playing for!

The Flintstones - Over 18's Demo about your favourite stoneage family.
Wheel Of Fortune - Great conversion of the TV Game. Edit the Questions
file on your favourite text editor to include your own entries.

Wormtris - This is a totally excellent Tetris game,  of which  I  have
many,   but I like this one as one of the best.  Cross between  Tetris
and Worms, which doesn't bear thinking about. Very daft and great fun.
X  Files  Guide  -  Lots  and Lots of info about  my  favourite  SciFi
programme. Also includes colour slides of Scully & Mulder.


There  you  have it.  Drop me a line if you want some of these  disks,
and I will send them out - remember of course to send me the disks!

If  you think your PD is better than those above,  and you want to try
and  get  your program on the list,  then please send me a copy,   and
remember,  people who send me bribes might better their chances  of  a
mention, so any presents are welcome.

Also,  keep checking the PD file for new editions. I am sorry, but the
file  has  been sorted into alphabetical order.  Before,  new editions
were at the bottom of the file,  but I found it to hard to read, so it
is now sorted.

This  is a list of new PD disks I have just got.  I have not given  an
explanation  of each disk - just it`s title.  An explanation  of  each
disk will be in the main PD list document.

I already have had most of these titles for a long time now,  but they
were  on  loads of archive disks that I have had,  and I had  not  got
around to putting them onto the guide.  I have now,  and I am not even
half  way  through it - What you see below will fill  about  6  disks,
only about another 30 to go!

The  Mods that are listed are actually the ones you hear when you load
the  game they come from.  I got them from the Aminet,  and there  are
plenty more where they came from!

Below  is listed some of the Public Domain Games that I have put  onto
disks,  to remove them from my Hard Drive. All the disks do not have a
startup-sequence and do not boot,  so you will have to load  Workbench
first to use them.

I  have  deleted these entries temporarily,  as I am in the middle  of
converting  these disks to 960K,  so all the contents of  these  disks
have  been  changed.   Normal service shall  be  resumed  as  soon  as

@{fg text}
This  is a list of most of the Utilities that I have.  What I did  was
Lha  the  files,  and cram as many as I could onto disks.  This  meant
that  where  before  I  had two disk boxes of  utils,   by  using  Lha
compression,  I now only have one,  which means I have saved about  40
disks,  which I can use to get more PD.  These disks do not  have  any
startup sequence,  just Lha files. If you cannot decompress Lha files,
I  can supply the Lha command and how to use it easily (Lha x <name of
archive> RAM:), or I could give you some utilities to do it for you.

This is only a list of what is on the disks.  To see what they all do,
refer to the guide.
@{i}
The contents of these disks are stored on Diskspare Disks,  which have
been  formatted  to  960K.  If you have this filing system  installed,
then  you can use a direct copy of these disks.  However,  if  you  do
not,  then these disks will not be read properly,  and I will have  to
give you just the single archive that you require.

@{fg text}
Below  is  listed some of the clipart disks I have in  my  collection.
What I have done is bought loads of Clipart over the years,  saved  it
onto my Hard Drive, and sorted it into directories for ease of use.

There  is  dozens of disks listed and I will just give you the  number
of the disk and what is on them roughly, in Subject Headings.

Disk 01 - Aminals
Disk 02 - Animals 2 
Disk 03 - Animals 3,  Banners 
Disk 04 - Banners 2 
Disk 05 - Banners 3,  Business 
Disk 06 - Busines 2,  Computers
Disk 07 - Comic Setter,  Food,  DPaint 
Disk 08 - DPaint 2,  Misc 
Disk 09 - Dpaint 3,  Travel 
Disk 10 - Sport 
Disk 11 - Places, Events 
Disk 12 - Events 2  
Disk 13 - Buildings,  People 
Disk 14 - Female 
Disk 15 - Male 
Disk 16 - Screengrabs (Some are a bit risky.  Over 15`s only)  
Disk 17 - SG Clipart (Drawings I have made. Some are personal, so this
	  disk will be censored before it is released.)
Disk 18 - Ham 1 (Some are over 15`s only) 
Disk 19 - Ham 2 (Some are over 15`s only)  
Disk 20 - Ham 3 (Some are over 15`s only)
Disk 21 - Ham 4 (Some are over 15`s only)  
Disk 22 - Ham 5 (Some are over 15`s only)

Just ask me for Clipart Disk number xx,  and I wil copy it for you.  I
also  have some other Clipart disks,  which are listed in the Main  PD
Guide,  ie,  Flintstones and Cartoons etc.  Just ask for them  in  the
normal way.

@{fg text}
Do  you  have anything that you want to sell? Do you want to advertise
it  cheaply,  and advertise it to a range of Amiga Owners? Well,  this
is  the place for you.  Just write to me with details of what you want
to sell,  and I really don`t mind what you sell,  and I will put it in
the next issue.  Your advert will stay in for as long as you want,  or
until you sell the item,  so remember and tell me it is sold.  I  will
only  hold adverts on file for a maximum of 6 isssues.  If it  is  not
sold  within  6 months,  then it cannot be much of a bargain  can  it?
There  is only one stipulation.  Either pay me a few pound for  typing
in the advert,  or you can give me the advert on disk, either in Ascii
text or an IFF file,  but I would prefer the ascii text file.  I  will
keep the disk as payment.  Please can you only send your adverts on  a
Double Density Disk. I do not really have a need for High
Density Disks.

Wanted  - Does anybody have the following games that they are  willing
          to swap.  Only original disks wanted - no pirates.  For use 
          on an A600. Will swap for other commercial games, PD, or may 
	  even buy:

Here is the list:	Arcade Pool
			Stardust
			Football Glory
			Sim City
			Gianna Sisters
			Spatial Hyperdrive (Public Domain)
			Continental Tech Dance (Music Demo)
			Easy AMOS + Compiler
			Deluxe Paint 2 or 3

Wanted - Blank Disks are in great need.  I prefer Double Density  ones
         as High Density can be a bit dodgy on the Amiga.  Do you want 
         to get rid of all those old magazine  coverdisks that are  at
         the bottom of your drawers? You do? Well give them  to me!  I
         can use them to buy more Public Domain Disks, which will keep
         my costs down and allow me to  buy much more of  high quality 
	 programs, which you can then swap with me.Either  post me the 
	 disks if you are feeling generous, or tell  how many you have 
	 and how much you want for them and I will consider your offer
         so please make the price cheap, as I want to keep the  Public
	 Domain scene alive.  Thanks for  your help.  I  am willing to 
         swap blank disks for blank disk labels, as I buy my labels in 
	 bulk, so I have loads.

@{fg text}
Every  issue  is  packed with news,  views,  information,   tutorials,
humour and more!

Amiga  Format  reviewed  issue 1,  and said  'Doubleclick  looks  very
promising', and 'this could be the ultimate diskmag'.

Recent issues have featured tutorials in AMOS,  Assembler,  ARexx  and
C/C++;  covering shoot 'em ups,  3D graphics, Doom clones, encryption,
chaos  theory,   as well as tutorials on HTML,  Amigaguide,   Personal
Paint, Workbench, Shapeshifter, and loads more.

DoubleClick is currently available in either HTML or Amigaguide format.

Issue 5 out now, Issue 6 due out early 1998.

DoubleClick is available from Aminet in docs/mags (under the name  DC,
eg,   DC5_vHTML.lha),   and  also   available  from  my  homepage  at:

@{b}members.tripod.com/~Mark_Harman@{ub}

Alternatively,  get it on disk from me via post by  sending  £1.25  to
this  address,  and requesting DoubleClick.  Please state the  version
you  want (HTML or Guide),  and which issue you want (or you  can  ask
for the latest one):

A quick Questionaire for you to fill in:

Please  could you take the time to fill in this questionaire.   Select
Print  from the Project Menu.  If you do not have a printer,   do  not
worry,   load the questionaire into your favourite text  editor,   and
fill  in  the blanks.  Resave the document and mark on the disk  label
that  you have completed the questionaire,  and return the disk.   The
purpose of this is so that I can see how many people are reading  this
disk,  and what you want from it. Please feel free to tell me anything
that is wrong,  ie loading times or choice of music etc. ! I will only
pass  on your name and address to Pentrisoft and Amicom Public  Domain
if you answer the corresponding questions.  By filling in this survey,
you  are helping me find out what kind of computer you own,  what  age
group you fall into,  and most importantly,  if you want to write  for
Doubleclick!   Please pass a copy of this disk onto your  friends  and
let  them  reply to me as well.  Thanks for your help.   If  you  have
already filled in one,  and you have since upgraded your setup,   then
please let me know.

Please  list ALL computer equipment,  ie Model,  Hard Drive,  External
Drives, CD-Roms, Memory Boards etc: __________________________________

______________________________________________________________________

______________________________________________________________________

Do  you  object to your details being shown in this guide,  for  other
Amiga users to write to you?: ______________

Do  you  wish  your  name & address to be passed  onto  Amicom  Public
Domain,   for  details  on  how  to  buy  Public  Domain  Software  at
competitive prices?: _______________________

Are you interested in joining Pentrisoft?: _____________

Are  you  interested  in  writing   articles  for  Doubleclick!,   the
Pentrisoft Amiga disk magazine?: _______________________

Are you conversant in using Lha archive files,  and would it be OK  to
supply  disks in this format? If you can it would be better  for  you,
as  I  can  get  a  lot more onto a disk in Lha format,   rather  than
supplying it unpacked.  This means that you get more software  on  the
same number of disks.: _____________

Would you be interested in installing the Diskspare disk format, which
allows you to format DD disks to 960K (FFS)?: ______________________

Please list any comments about this disk below.  Please write  on  the
back of the page if necessary.

Please list also below,  programs that you use regularly on your Amiga
(Serious utilities only - PPaint, Wordworth etc.).

Also,  one last thing.  In this guide,  I can allow you to print out a
paragraph to introduce yourself,  just like an advert that  you  would
find in a magazine,  looking for penpals.  This will appear below your
details in the Computer Contacts section, so, if you want to write out
a paragraph about yourself,  then go ahead.  I will not put a limit on
the amount that you write, but I will stipulate that if it goes on and
on  (like me!)  for about 6 pages,  then I shall edit it to my liking,
although  I will be quite lenient.  If you want to put it  on  another
bit of paper,  then please do so,  but obviously,  send it! If you are
typing this out on a text editor,  and are sending me the file back on
disk,  then you can write as much as you want, as I won't have to type
it out - just format it!

Thanks again,

I do not see why I should jeopardize my life because someone cannot be
bothered to spend money and buy pirate versions of games.   A  lot  of
time,  money and effort goes into writing these titles, as is so often
found in Shareware too.  Why should you be guilty of taking the  bread
from their mouths, as it were.

The  reason of this list is simple.  If you are either stuck on a game
listed,  or are looking for tips for cheats,  or want to know  how  to
perform  a certain task in a utility,  then you can look up the  list,
see if I have the title,  and write to me with your query. If I cannot
help, I know a lot of people who can!

A quick note from me:

I  have  bought the majority of my Disks from these guys for ages  now
and they are brill.  I sent them a package on a Wednesday of about  30
disks,  and I got it back on the Saturday.  Not bad considering  there
was  a 24 hour postal strike on the Thursday/Friday.  They always have
a  new  stream  of  disks arriving and are very  friendly  and  always
willing to help (Do I get my money now?). Long Live Amicom.

By the way - Thanks for the Little ASCII Man (See Above) ...

Please note that Amicom PD have now moved.  Note their new address
below:

Send you another package very soon.

          Hi and welcome to our Monthly updated CATALOGUE DISK packed
          with loads and loads of quality Amiga PD & Shareware titles
          for you and your Amiga to enjoy.

          If you don't see the Title that you want, give us a call on
          (01924-864798) we may be able to get it for you.

          Well hope you do find something of interest and remember we
          also add loads more new titles every week. So keep in touch.

          When you purchase any of our  Titles you may be a bit eager
          to check them out. Well that's fine most of the Titles will
          bootup when inserted in your disk drive, but many will need
          either your  WorkBench disk or a particular  program to use
          the Title you purchased. 

          So please take time and read any document's you come across
          and don't get angry if you find that it don't seem to work.
          You may just be  doing  something  wrong and by reading the
          documents and following the instructions you will so get to
          use the Title you just purchased.

@{ub}          
	  Minimum accepted Cheques and Postal Orders is £3.00. Sorry.
          Orders of any less please send in  Postage Stamp value ok.

          Write down the DISK NUMBERS, TITLES and the AMOUNT of Disks.
 
          At the side of the  TITLES you will see if the disk is more
          than 1 disk  e.g. (A,B) at the end of a TITLE means it is a
          2 disk set, (A,B,C) means 3 disk set and so on. Also at the
          very end of the  TITLE line you will notice in brackets e.g.
          (Wb1,2,3) this tells you which type of SYSTEM the TITLE may
          work on. 
          
          (WE CANNOT GUARANTEE IF TITLES WILL WORK ON YOUR SYSTEM)

          There are too many systems to check them all correctly.

CIS  are  a  group of Amiga fanatics who put together the Batman slideshow
which I just bought.  It is pictures taken from the animated Batman series
that  you  see on the early morning cartoons on Saturday on ITV etc.   The
drawings are very high quality, and with their permission, I will be using
some of them in future issues of this guide.  I wrote to them a while ago,
but still have not heard from them again.

I have owned an Amiga for 2 years now - I first owned an A600 and then
in  June  / July 1997 I bought an A1200.  Most of my time is spent  on
swapping  PD in my library called Gunsmoke PD.  In my library  I  have
just over 1000 disks which include Utilities,  Games,  Slides,  Anims,
Coverdisks,  Music, Fred Fish, Diskmags etc. I also own Aminet Set Box
3, 5, Aminet CD 16 & AGA Experience CD Volume 2.

Andy  is  the programmer of the excellent diary and planner,  Remdate,
which  I  of course,  have registered for,  and I suggest you  do  the
same.  He also wrote the game Tetren, which in my opinion, is the best
Tetris style game I have ever seen.  It only has 30 levels,  which you
may  think  is hard,  but you will find it VERY VERY hard to  complete
this game.  I have sent a letter to him,  asking for the passwords  to
the  levels.  I can only get to level 10,  and belive me,  it was hard
going.  You will have to bribe me very much,  as I will be not  giving
these passwords out to anyone,  you know.  This man spent ages writing
this  game.  The least you can do is play it properly.  Note to Andy:-
Is my advertising fee in the post yet!

This  man is also GOD!  At the start of October,  my Hard Drive  broke
down  and  was  completely wiped!  This man came to  my  rescue,   and
supplied  me  with a disk which has saved my computer from extinction!
I can only thank this man from the bottom of my heart.

@{fg text}
Below  is  a  text file from the Pentrisoft Members Pack,   which  you
receive  when  you  enquire about joining.  On it is  textfiles  about
Pentrisoft,  the latest Doubleclick, and some Pentrisoft logos for you
to use.

@{b}- What is PentriSoft?@{ub}

PentriSoft  is a non-profitmaking association for computer programmers
whose  aim is to help genuine shareware and freeware authors  of  high
quality programs to succeed in the world market for software.


@{b}- What platforms does PentriSoft cover?@{ub}

In theory,  PentriSoft is for programmers on all computers, but at the
moment,   we can only support those on the Amiga and Apple  Macintosh.
Although  the two 'sections' of PentriSoft share the same name,   logo
and aims, things are kept fairly separate.


@{b}- How did PentriSoft begin?@{ub}

PentriSoft was the brainwave of my friend Stephane Gray.  He is a  Mac
programmer,   and  has  since   enlisted   many  other  shareware  Mac
programmers.  I am now trying to do the same thing for the Amiga.  See
PentriNews_June, or DoubleClick! for more information.

@{b}- How can PentriSoft help programmers?@{ub}

PentriSoft can offer individual programmers a means by which they  can
contribute  to the shareware system as well as providing  the  use  of
advertising,   beta testing and programming tips from  other  members.
Soon,   we  hope to offer some sort of evaluation system,   and  maybe
later  on,  a distribution system,  where programs are advertised  and
distributed  `in  bulk'.    PentriSoft   has  members  with  years  of
experience in programming on the Amiga and Apple Macintosh,  eager  to
offer friendly tips and advice to enthusiastic newcomers.


@{b}- How do I join?@{ub}

Simply  return the questionnaire/Registration file  to  me  at:   

Mark Harman  
3 Highlea Close 
St. Leonards On Sea 
East Sussex 
TN37 7SS 
 
I  will then send you more details,  and maybe put you in contact with
other programmers.  You will not be charged for anything at any  time,
but it will speed up replies if you send an SAE.


@{b}- What does joining PentriSoft involve?@{ub}

By  joining,   you  do not sacrifice any of your ownership  rights  or
programmer fees,  but you do benefit from a network of friendly fellow
programmers,  vastly increased distribution,  and the right to  use  a
symbol  of  software quality that can be displayed on  program.   From
time to time,  PentriSoft may put other programmers, working in fields
in  which  you  have experience,  in touch with you so  that  you  can
exchange  tips and advice about your programs.  Please  note  that  we
reserve  the right to end a programmer's membership at any  time  (but
there'll be no need for that, of course...;)


@{b}- Tell me more about the disk-mag `Double-Click'.@{ub}

Well,   the best thing is to see it for yourself.  Articles  are  very
welcome!

@{b}- I know some other Amiga programmers; how do they join?@{ub}

Get them to write to me (Mark)  at the above address, or better still,
give  them  a copy of this disk and ask them to return a duplicate  of
the  questionnaire (or the registration program if that's what  you've
got).


@{b}- I know some Mac programmers; how do they join?@{ub}

This is important;  do NOT get them to write to me;  instead, ask them
to write to this address:

   Stephane Gray
   Oaklands
   Rock Lane
   Hastings
   East Sussex
   TN35 4NY

He will send them some more details.


@{b}- I know programmers of other platforms; can they join?@{ub}

Well,   no  is the simple answer.  However,  if there was  someone  of
another  platform who wanted to actually set up PentriSoft on  another
platform, then write to me, and I'll see what I can do.

@{b}- More about us?@{ub}

Stephane  Gray,  who originally came up with the idea,   controls  all
things  Mac  related.  Actually,  I think he passed  control  over  to
someone else recently,  but I'm not too sure.  I (Mark Harman)  am  in
control  of  the  Amiga  related section.  I shall  also  mention  Rob
Forster,  who isn't a programmer,  but kindly beta-tests our programs.
We are all 17/18 years old,  studying hard for our A Levels. Who knows
how  we find time to do things like this...  Both me and Stephane have
released  some  PD programs,  but haven't made vast amounts  of  money
from programming (yet?).

@{b}- What Amiga do I own?@{ub}

I  ought to say,  since I'm asking about yours.  I own an A1200,  with
340MB Hard Drive,  which I've recently upgraded to an '030,  with 10MB
of  RAM.  If you're thinking of upgrading,  please do,  it makes  your
life so much better!  I also have a 24-pin printer to slowly churn out
the various bits and pieces.


@{b}-What programming language do I use?@{ub}

I  use  AMOSPro,  so I would especially like to hear from  other  AMOS
users.  Don't worry if you aren't, however; PentriSoft is for users of
ALL  programming  languages.  I  also  know  a  little  C  and  ARexx.
Stephane, by the way, uses something called `Hypercard'.

@{b}- What programs have I written?@{ub}

A  lottery  program  (Lottery Numbers),   a  file  encryption  program
(Protector),  and even a biorhythm program (BioCalc), which are in the
public domain.  I've written various others, but just haven't released
them yet (I just can't be bothered).  And, of course, both versions of
the viewer for DoubleClick!


@{b}- What if I drastically upgrade my Amiga, or Get a New One?@{ub}

The  hardware  questionnaire is only really for beta testing  purposes
(if someone wants to see if a program runs on a particular setup,   or
it  has  higher than average system requirements),  so  it  isn't  too
important.   Having  said that,  I'll always be  interested  to  hear,
anyway...
