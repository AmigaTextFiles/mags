<BR>All other times write to my home address. It doesn't really matter if you send to the wrong one, it'll just take longer for a reply. As you can see, I also have an e-mail, but I can only access it from uni!

<P><B>Doubleclick Issue 6 Editorial</B>

<P>Hello there!

<P>Welcome to a brand new issue of your favourite e-zine, and hopefully you'll like the new look that we've been working on for 
the HTML version. A new look, and lots of new things to announce. For the first time, this magazine is available to read online, at http://members.tripod.com/~DoubleClick_Mag/, or you can download from my homepage http://members.tripod.com/~Mark_Harman/, or Aminet as usual. Because issues are online now, you may occasionally see links refering to Internet addresses, but don't worry if you are viewing offline, just ignore them.

<P>The Amigaguide version may have to be replaced due to problems. We still want to cater for low end users, and may opt for just a collection of text files, maybe with a menu system. Simple, yes, but it will work on any Amiga, from a 1.3 512k machine (details are not decided at the time of writing). For those who want more, the HTML version will always be 
around, of course.

<P>We have also announced two new services for those with Internet access, so you can get the latest version of DC as soon a it's released for free! Find out all about it <A HREF="Inetsub.html">here</A>.

<P>There are also some various regular pages that we hope to be starting, in particular Recommended Web Sites, List of Currently Available Amiga Models. Also a change in structure; the News Pages Menu and PD Reviews page are listed in the <A HREF="Articles.html">main Computing Articles page</A>.

<HR>I picked up a copy of <I>T3</I> magazine the other day, and had a glance through the editorial. It was saying about new palmtops that run Windows CE, and new computer systems in cars that also run Windows CE. But far from saying how good this might 
be, the editor was saying how dangerous having Microsoft with such a huge monopoly is.

<P>Up until now, the fact that every computer runs Windows has been considered by most people a great thing! So what, they argue, after a while, standards always appear in technology, for example, VHS over Betamax. Never mind that the Windows 'standard', far from being an open standard, is one owned and produced by a single company. Generally, market share of 25% is considered a monopoly - Microsoft has a market share of around <I>96%</I> in operating systems. If you look at a PC magazine, you will see that people's definitions of 'multiplatform', or different operating systems means running on DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows '95 and Windows NT... And there's no reason to expect Microsoft to stop until they have a complete monopoly in all software. With a huge single company, no one can compete. Operating systems, especially, is an incredibly difficult market to enter. If any other company gets too much of a problem, just buy into them, or buy them outright (Apple?)

<P>But it seems to me that maybe now people are realising that this isn't such a good thing, just like the editor of T3. From people chucking pies at Bill Gates, to them losing court battles, 
maybe people will come to consider alternative operating systems.

<P>Of course, for the Amiga, that needs new technology for the OS 
to run on, and thankfully, this is coming fast. It is now (or at least, very shortly) possible to have an Amiga with a 200MHz 604e, and top of the range graphics card (1600x1200, 24bit, 8MB VRAM and 3D). New motherboards are appearing, and hopefully we will soon have boards with PPC and PCI slots as standard - Micronik already have their Infinitiv 1500 accepting PCI cards.

<P>To the future, we have multiprocessor PPC cards, which boards like the BoXeR will be quite capable of accepting, and with PPC, there really is no problems with speed.

<P>You will surely have heard of the new G3 Macs. The G3, also known as the 750, is the next PPC processor on from the 604e, and 
it's <I>fast</I>! Some benchmarks show it twice as fast as an equivalent clocked Pentium!

<P>It's these processors which mean that Apple can claim their machines as the fastest desktop computers in the world, and to that end, I can't wait for the Amiga to get a slice of that speed 
- they won't be able to claim that if you can get an Amiga with a processor just as fast.

<P>Of course, software is also needed, but it is appearing, and hopefully Amiga International's commitment to PPC will persuade companies to port their software across.

<P>PPC aside, interesting details of Index Information's InsideOut machine have become available. It seems that this is an Amiga on a PCI card. Plug it into a PC or Alpha of your choice, and your Amiga suddenly has access to a fast processor, as well as all the resident PCI cards.

<HR>Aside from all this, we have some decent games appearing on the Amiga at last. This issue, we have a <A HREF="mystrev.html">review of Myst</A>! The CD was there to meet me when I returned to uni, and it's a great game - although recently, I have been putting it aside to play <A HREF="doom.html">Doom</A>, which has finally come to the Amiga through a different route.

<HR>
Lastly, please take time to fill out the <A HREF="Questionnaire.html">questionnaire</A>, as it will be of immense use to us. Either post it to me or Stephen, or email it, whatever. Hope you like this issue, and watch out for issue 7 in a few months' time!
