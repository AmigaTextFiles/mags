<P>The Amiga has always had niches in areas such as multimedia and video, and with licensing and new technology, hopefully the Amiga will return more strongly than ever to these areas.

<P>NewTek future development is, sadly, uncertain, but there is a 
new product that aims to do for the Amiga now, what the Video Toaster did for the Amiga in the late eighties.

<P>Named the Playable TV, it is actually based around the Video Toaster. There were some initial problems about them getting a license from NewTek - they were considering basing it around the PC, something they did not want to do.

<P>Thankfully, sense has shone through, and hopefully this revolutionary product will make it to the Amiga, and do wonders for the platform...

<P>But what <I>is</I> Playable TV? You can read all about it at <A HREF="http://www.playabletv.com">www.playabletv.com</A>, but I 
shall explain for readers without internet access.

<P>Details are sketchy, but it appears to be a hardware / software package that is based around the Amiga and Video Toaster 
/ Flyer. Products are tailored individually to suit particular needs.

<P>The Access looks great, but it is extremely low end ('020/030?  
AGA?) Playable TV, on the other hand, is the other end of the spectrum, <I>extremely</I> high end.

<P>Here's a brief run down of some of the specifications:<UL><DD>
<LI>Touch Screen Television Interface
<LI> Remote interface up to 70 feet from the system 
<LI>2 - 24 bit Simultaneous Video Streams 
<LI>Instantaneous Video to Video Access and Dissolves 
<LI>Up to 520 Hours of Playback Video 
<LI>4 - Channels 16 bit Stereo Audio (Up to 8 Possible) 
<LI>2 - Live Video Feeds In (Up to 8 Possible) 
<LI>Program Input 
<LI>SVHS Loop BNC in / out 
<LI>Video Loop in / out 
<LI>Aux Video output 
<LI>Audio Loop in / out 
<LI> Audio in / var out 
<LI>56k Modem 
<LI>TCP/IP and FTP compatible 
<LI>Remote updating, reprogramming, and maintenance 
<LI>Internet access 
<LI>110 VOLTS in/out 
</UL><DL>

<P>There are also details of various other features, including Interactive Interface, Systems Activation (eg, motion detectors),  
Statistical Memory, Card Readers, Security (locks, limited access, surveillance cameras, etc), Remote Programming and Intelligent Operations (self diagnostics and monitoring).

<P>They will provide a presentation system specifically suited to 
a company's needs.

<HR>This is not vapourware - this is available now!

<P>Such a system is of course no interest directly to the average 
Amiga user. But hopefully this system will encourage NewTek to continue developing the Video Toaster for the Amiga, and also produce Lightwave 5.5 for Amiga and PPC Amiga.
