The  last  time I ran this advert in Amiga Format,  the  response  was
great.  Now that my postman has recovered from his hernia operation, I
want  to do it all again!  Amiga Public Domain contacts wanted.   Will
reply A1200%.  Looking for contacts all over the world,  and not  just
in the UK.  I can swap PD over the 'Net,  although I am restricted  to
handling  Lha  files  with a Maximum of 700K.  I  can  swap  unlimited
amounts  vis Snail Mail though.  I have a full list of all the  Public
Domain  software that I own on disk.  Other penpals I  write  to  have
agreed  to  let  me send you their details as well,   so  as  well  as
writing to me,  you could also be writing to them two.  I have penpals
all over the UK,  as well as Norway,  Yugoslavia,  and some other  far
flung  places.  I am a member of Pentrisoft,  who promote Shareware  &
its  authors  and I am a Co Editor of Doubleclick!,   the  diskmag  we
produce,  currently into our fith issue.  Please send a double density
disk  or  £1.50  to  cover the cost of a disk and return  postage  to:
Stephen Graham,  PO Box 8353,  Largs,  North Ayrshire,  Scotland, KA30
8HG.  Remember that I will not swap copies of commercial software,  so
no  pirates please.  Also looking for people to contribute in any  way
to  Doubleclick!   Please send all contibutions  to  me  at  the  same
address.  Issues 1 - 4 available now!  Please contact me for  details.
Help make the Amiga great again - Back for the Future!
