<P><B>Hello, and welcome to the sixth issue of DoubleClick!</B>

<P>We are now been distributing only in pure HTML, and plain text  format if you prefer to live without HTML. That is, the HTML version requires you to have a Web Browser. Please read the relevant section...

<P><B>HTML Version</B> - Also known as the FULL version

<P>If this is the disk distributable (ie, you didn't download it from Aminet, or something), then there is a special Local-only version of AWeb 3; the system requirements are 2MB RAM, hard disk, OS3.0+, and Class Act (provided). Many thanks to Yvon Rozijn for giving us permission to distribute this version with the mag. Please note that this version of AWeb should only be used with DoubleClick, and not distributed separately!

<P>Of course, if you prefer Voyager or IBrowse, then fine, use them. I have provided AWeb because it doesn't use MUI and is low on system requirements, so should keep everyone happy (if you have less than AWeb's sys. requirements, then get the AmigaGuide version!) AWeb also loads IFFs (unlike Voyager), as well as being 
an excellent browser, anyway.

<P>If you download from aminet, then you will only get the HTML files - I presume you can download a Web Browser yourself.

<P>Of course, you may well be reading this online! (The address is members.tripod.com/~DoubleClick_Mag if you aren't, but want to 
check it out). Bear in mind that having created this mag with Amiga browsers (Voyager, in particular) and cannot guaruntee it working with the likes of Netscape and Internet Explorer. My experience has shown me that IE is fine, but there may be a few problems with Netscape when displaying tables that are imbedded in each other (help on this would be appreciated!) Also bear in mind that DC uses PNGs extensively, so you need the latest versions of these browsers to see the graphics.

<P>The biggest problem with HTML is playing mods - see the <A HREF="music.html">music page</A> for information on how to play mods via a Web Browser, because it is possible. Also, there are some Amigaguides which can be viewed from the browser <A HREF="conguides.html">if you configure it correctly</A>. Of course, if you're not viewing this on an Amiga, then you'll miss out, but you can always download the files (hold down shift whilst clicking on the link) and save to disk to view/hear on your Amiga.

<P><B>Plain Text Version</B> - Also known as the LITE version

<P>This replaces the old Amigaguide version, and is basically the 
text files placed on a disk for you to view through. Simple, yes, but it means it will work on all Amigas (well, at least 1.3 and above). You can autoboot, or view from Workbench. All the files are sorted into separate folders on the disk, along with modules, 
etc.

<P><B>IMPORTANT!</B> The version which is on Aminet will require either a hard disk to decompress to, or sufficient free RAM (probably 1-1.5MBs Free RAM), although you could split it up onto 
floppies after, if you wish. If you don't have a hard disk, it is probably best to get the 'disk distributable' version from us (Mark or Stephen), or maybe a PD library.

<H2>Support for Future Issues!</H2>

<P>What's in future issues of this Diskmag, and when they get released depends on <B>you</B>, the reader. The more letters, articles and so on that I receive, the sooner I can release the next issue, and the better it can be. Needless to say, this will be helped if more people see this mag, so please don't hesitate it to give it to your friends, send it to PD libraries, upload it to BBSs, etc. Remember: More support = More and Better Articles = Better Mag!
<HR>
<H2>How Can I Get Earlier Issues?</H2>

<P>These may be available from some PD libraries, but instead, you can get them from <A HREF="EditorMark.html">Mark</A> or <A HREF="EditorStephen.html">Stephen</A>. Cost is &#163;1 for issues  1 and 2, and &#163;1.20 for issues 3-5. Please specify what issue you want, and whether you want the Full or Lite version..

<P><H2><A HREF="Submiss.html">How to Submit Your Articles, etc!</A></H2>

<P>Read it, enjoy it, <B>and write some of your own articles! </B>Any help I receive will be greatly appreciated.
