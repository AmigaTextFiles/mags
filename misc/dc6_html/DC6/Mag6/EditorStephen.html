<P><B>Doubleclick Issue 6 Editorial</B>

<P>Hello Readers,

<P>Well,   Christmas is now gone and forgotten for another  year  -  only
about  300 days until the next one!  All the turkey and ham  has  been
well and truly finished off, with the last of the sandwiches, and soup
being consumed only last week.  (This section was written at New Year,
just in case you think I keep soup for months on end)

<P>Needless to say,  I shall have to get a larger wardrobe, as all I seem
to get these days is clothes.  Still didn't get my CD Rom, although my
birthday is soon (See above,  although it shall have passed  when  you
read this,  but any late presents shall be greatly received,  or  even
very  early ones for next year - I promise to give a mention to anyone
that sends me anything!).

<P>Well, it should be easier for Mark (the other editor) to send stuff to
me now,  as the E-Mail will be back on line, now that the Universities
are  both back for the Spring Term.  Needless to say,  I have got  the
diskspare.device working on my Amiga now,  so that I can format  disks
to a dizzy 960K, which must be an all time record for a DD disk!

<P>I  also have an updated version of this system,  but they two  do  not
seem to be compatible,  so I will have to redo all my disks. This will
have to wait for now.

Spent  all of the holidays playing ADoom.  The creators of  Doom,   ID
Software decided that for a great Xmas present, they would release the
source code to their excellent PC (I hated saying that)  game.  Within
minutes,   Amiga  programmers sat and pondered  between  eating  their
Christmas dinner, or trying to recompile an Amiga version of the game.
Needless to say the turkey was given a reprieve until Boxing Day,   as
this is when Amiga versions of the game started to appear on the  Web.
My brother managed to get ADoom, and the WAD files for the game, which
was  pretty good going considering that he can only handle 700K  at  a
time.  Now we both play this game non stop, and my brother has already
completed  it.   Amiga Format released their February  Issue,   and  I
expected the pages to be chock a block with news about this - nothing,
not  even a small mention.  Even the Subscribers letter had no mention
of this great addition to the all time Amiga games.  Expect to read a
review of this game from my brother somewhere in these hallowed pages [Er, no review as such this issue, although we have coveered it as a news item - Mark].

<HR>

Thanks to all the people who bothered to send me a Birthday card and /
or Birthday Greetings,  and make me feel as old as I am. I could count
all  the replies I got in both my hands!  Not as many as I had  hoped,
but enough all the same.

<HR>

I  now have a NEW E-Mail address.  Thanks to those wonderful people at
Bigfoot and Strathclyde University (namely my brother!),  I have  been
able to get my own E-Mail Address, even though I am not personally Net
connected.  All mail sent to this address (which is shown above)  will
be  redirected to my brother's E-Mail address in the University at  no
cost.   Pretty  neat.  One good thing to come out of America  at  last
(except for Snickers, M&amp;M's and not forgetting our wonderful Amiga's).

Read  in  the  papers last week that Bill Gates was attacked  by  some
Belgian Tiswas fans.  The Phantom Flan Thrower strikes again.  I  must
say,  that it could not happen to a nicer man.  I have just heard that
some  bright  person  uploaded an MPEG Movie of  said  attack  to  the
Aminet.  The only problem is that it is about 4.3MB in size,  so  that
rules  out my idea of loading it as a Startup Anim.  Apparently,   the
attack  was  carried out by a group of Belgian students,   who  target
figures in the Media spotlight who "get too important for themselves".
Obviously,  Big Bad Bold Bill will be pretty near the top of the list,
and  when I read about this blatant "breach of human rights",  I could
only but laugh.

<P>By  the way - how many of our readers remember Tiswas? Not that  many,
I  fear.   Just  to see how many people do remember,  answer  me  this
question:  Can you name some of the comedians who started  in  Tiswas,
and  reached better and bigger things? Answers on a postcard to my  PO
Box,  or my NEW E-Mail address:  stephen_graham@bigfoot.com and I will
mention the answers in the next issue,  assuming I remember,  and  get
some replies.

<HR>

I  must thank Richard Fletcher for sending me a disk with loads of new
ideas for the mag,  as well as some articles.  Hopefully, we should be
able to use your articles in this issue,  but things are getting a bit
full  just now,  so we may have to hold them over to DC7 [nope, they're all in this issue! - Mark].  Also,  your
example magazine that you sent to me was absolutely storming - I shall
be  playing  your case very heavily - I showed it to my brother,   who
also  is an Amiga nut,  as he was equally impressed.  Please  send  me
more  of  the same - your talents are not wasted!  Have you  made  any
original OctaMED Music Modules that we would be interested  in?  I  am
sorry,   by  the way,  but I will not be sending your  details  to  my
brother  for  any Amiga Contacts for one good reason - he  could  talk
about Star Trek for the country - if it was an Olympic Sport, he would
be  there.  I am more like you,  although I do like to watch Star Trek
TNG  (The  Next  Generation if you did not know,   although  there  is
nothing that can surpass the original!)

<HR>

Things to look out for in this issue are of course anything written by
myself  - Pit Stop (Pretty good this month - especially the letter  at
the  end of it),  my new,  improved PD Guide,  and my PPaint Tutorial,
although  I apologise now for the Tutorial being a bit patchy,   as  I
have been VERY busy lately,  and I have had to let things slide.  As I
have  not  yet  seen  the pre release version of  the  magazine  (late
February),  I cannot comment on much else.  The magazine  is  sort  of
made in two halves,  which are seamlessly fitted together in the  end,
until all the technical hitches are found, where we have to start from
scratch again!

<HR>

One  last thing before I finish this Editorial.  Can anyone supply  me
with a cable to connect my Z88 Laptop computer (yes,  the one made  by
Sir Clive Sinclair)  to my Amiga A1200. I have a software package that
can  handle data transfer,  but any more programs would not go a miss.
Please contact me anytime at the above address, phone number (although
remember it is a Mobile phone,  although I can probably call you back,
as my calls are free),  or E-Mail address. I am willing to pay postage
for  the  cable  and / or disks as well.  I am quite urgently  needing
this,  as I now have found a good use for my Z88, and connecting it to
my Miggy would be a BIG help. 

<P>While  I am in my "please help a poor Amiga User" state,  and  that  I
have  got  you  reading  anyway,  I  want  to  pick  someone's  brains
concerning Amigaguide documentation.  My problem is that I want to  be
able to display an Amigaguide in colour, with some text one colour and
some  another.  I know how to get white (using @fg shine and @fg  text
to  return to black),  but I cannot get any other colours.   I  saw  a
guide once that used blue,  but did not find out how it was done.   It
is  possible,  but I cannot see how.  As for the other mags,  they are
not  really interested in how to do it.  AF ran a one off  tutorial  a
few months back,  but it was VERY basic,  and did not cover much. Pity
they  did  not keep it up,  as I was looking forward to learning  more
about it,  as I am used to writing Amigaguides (Just look at the two I
write  for the mag for examples - you are welcome to load  it  into  a
text  editor to see how it is done).  Is there any learned people  out
there who will take pity on my soul?

<HR>

Thanks for watching. See you next issue.
