<H1><B><CENTER>Another Car Bites The Dust - The End Of The Metro</CENTER></B></H1>

<P>I shed a few tears last week when I read that the last Rover Metro had
rolled off of the production line.  When it ceased production,  it had
a  change of name to a Rover 100,  as well as a few minor body changes
from  the  later Rover Metro, as it came to be known.  

<P>When they were launched in the early  1980's,
nobody  thought that Rover (or Austin Rover as they were  known  then)
could  build  a small car that could compete with their brand  leader,
the  Mini,   which had been selling steadily for decades before.   How
wrong they were,  as the Metro sold by the bucketload,  and made Rover
pots  of  money,   which they duly squandered on  buckets  called  the
Maestro and the Montego.  

<P>Part  of  the appeal to the Metro was the amount that you  could  cram
into the back of them when you folded the seats down.  As an ex owner,
I can vouch for this - there is loads of room in the back,  and I have
carried some strange loads in mine, and in fact I sold it to someone I
know,  and she is still using it to this day, making 500 mile trips in
it  quite often.  My version was the sporty MG Metro,  which  had  the
bigger  engine,   and the nicer interior with bucket  seats,   and  of
course, the all important go faster stripes and Alloy Wheels.

<P>Having  celebrity owners also did wonders for the little car.   Famous
drivers  included Princess Diana,  when she first met Prince  Charles.
Margaret  Thatcher and Tony Blair have also been  known  to  be  Metro
owners at some time.  For Inner London driving they were ideal,  being
able  to nip in and out of traffic with ease.  In fact,  Rover made  a
point  of  advertsing  this when they released  the  new  Rover  Metro
Kensington.

<P>Only  in  the  last  few  years have they had a  corporate  shake  up,
probably  due  to  their  buyout from BMW.  After  this,   names  were
dropped,   in  favour of numbers,  which has been a BMW tradition  for
years.  Out went the Metro,  and in came the Rover 100, although still
essentially a Metro with a few bells and whistles on it.  This was not
before  took  hold  of  the Metro in 1990,  and  gave  it  a  thorough
shakeup,   which meant that they could update the body  styling,   the
interior,  and most importantly,  the engine and gearbox.   This  also
meant that for the first time,  the Metro had a 5 speed gearbox, which
was  previously  not viable,  unless you went to a specialist  Road  &
Rally tuning company who specialised in building Race prepared Minis &
Metros - Jack Knight was one of the first.

<P>Towards the end of its life, it shared the same stable as the Rover
200 and 400 series, and its bigger sisters, the 600 series.  Also in
the range is the 800 series, with the top of the range 827 Sterling,
which has electric everything, as well as a V6 engine, built by Honda,
who up until recently has had a strong link with Rover, although this
was almost severed when BMW took over Rover.

<P>Some people will wish the Metro good riddance, but they are fun little
cars,  which,  along with the Mini,  had a cult following.  I will  be
probably be among the people who will miss it the most.
