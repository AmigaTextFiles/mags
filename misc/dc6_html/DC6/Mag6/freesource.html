<H1><B><CENTER>Descent Source Code Released - Netscape to Follow?</CENTER></B></H1>

<P>If you thought getting Doom on the Amiga was good, then this could just be the start!

<P>The Descent source code has now been released, and I would expect there to be numerous Amiga ports by the time you read this.

<P>But this is nothing compared to the announcement that Netscape 
have made. They have made their browser freeware, but far more significantly, they have stated they will release the source. After years of crying out for an industry standard (and ironically, about the same time that the Amiga browsers are supposed to be getting Javascript and Java support), we could be flooded with numerous ports of the browser.

<P>But there is more to it than the Amiga getting Netscape... As the Microsoft steamroller pressed on, it seemed inevitable that they would win the browser war. Even though they had been ruled against forcing PC manufacturers to ship Internet Explorer with machines, there was little hope for Netscape.

<P>Apparantely, Netscape makes plenty of money these days from other areas, rather than its famous browser. So do they quietly accept that they have lost the browser war and give in quietly? No, they take a move that will make things look far worse for IE.
