 <P><I>Why was the Great Exhibition of 1851 held and what did it achieve?</I>
 <BR><BR>
 The doors to the Crystal Palace were opened to the greatest exhibition  of
 the  nineteenth  century  in  1851. When they closed five months later six
 million visits had been made to see the displays of the fourteen  thousand
 exhibitors.  The  exhibition which was spearheaded by Prince Albert mainly
 aimed to increase exportation of  British  goods  and  to  encourage  free
 trade.  The exhibtion itself captured the public's imagination as was seen
 by the number of designs entered for the building to contain the exhibits.
 The design eventually chosen was that of Joseph Paxton, a gardener for the
 duke of Devonshire. It was  what  could  only  be  described  as  a  huge,
 majestic, and flamboyant greenhouse, which immediately earned the title of
 the Crystal Palace.
 <BR><BR>
 The exhibition was held during  a  period  of  economic  boom  and  social
 change.  Britain was expanding, the population had grown from twenty seven
 million in 1851 to thirty  two  million  in  1871.  Britain  supplied  the
 railways  to the world. In 1869 three hundred thousand tonnes of iron went
 to the USA alone. The Great  Exhibition  was  partly  held  to  show  this
 prosperity.  It  was  an  extension of the trade show idea manufactures in
 France had used to gain custom. The Great Exhibition  also  held  exhibits
 from  other countries with the intention of showing a dominance, it stated
 in no uncertain terms that Great Britain was the centre of  the  world  in
 terms  of  industry.  The  Queen,  Victoria,  recognised  how well the Great
 Exhibition did this "God bless my dear country which has shown  itself  so
 great today." The exhibtion showed the exact state of British industry and
 was the meant to display the influence the British industries had  on  the
 world. How Britain was described was as the "Workshop of the World."
 <BR><BR>
 As  well  as  the idea of promoting Britain as the "Workshop of the world"
 the Great Exhibition displayed the sense of  pride  the  British  held  in
 their  country.  This  is  shown  by  the fact that the working class were
 prepared to travel from the north and the middlelands to see it.  So  many
 people wanted to see the Great Exhibition that the company Thomas Cook was
 founded and went into buisness to transport people around the country,  an
 activity which was becoming cheaper and cheaper which highlights again the
 comparative wealth of the nation.
 <BR><BR>
 Most of all the Great Exhibition was designed to increase the  exports  of
 Britain  to  other  countries,  it  was  the  major aim and by showing its
 dominance and industrial advancement to the world  it  was  reasonable  to
 believe  that the desired effect would be gained. The Great exhibition was
 also held due to more mundane reasons such as, to make money  and  because
 Prince  Albert,  a man who the public did not immediatly like, spearheaded
 the project. Prince Albert backed the idea fully  because,  amongst  other
 things,  of  what  it  would  achieve,  or  at  least what it was hoped to
 achieve.
 <BR><BR>
 The higher exports that the Great Exhibition was designed to  achieve  was
 only  had  a short term effect, although exports continually increased the
 boom that the Great Exibition was responsible for was soon inaparent.  The
 exhibition  did  show just how strong the British were in foreign affairs,
 especially industry. It had been able to do what it had wanted in  so  far
 as it showed the world that London was the centre of the world where money
 and industry was concerned.
 <BR><BR>
 Also, as far as Industry was concerned, the event educated  the  countries
 which  were  not as advanced as Britain, in other words it set up a vision
 of the future for those countries which had not  undergone  an  Industrial
 Revolution and it showed them how to bring one about. The Great Exhibition
 was a chance for fairly wealthy countries to learn and become  competition
 for  Britain.  This  they did and the fact that Britain had advanced first
 acted against it as better machines were made and used in countries  which
 developed later. The new machines offered better production techniques and
 a better efficiency  which  meant  that  Britain  which  was  using  older
 machines  was  behind because to buy the more advanced machines would have
 been an economic mistake. To buy more machinery would mean an increase  in
 prices  which  would  have  meant  far less of the product would have been
 sold. So the Great Exhibition educated of the other nations of  the  world
 on  how  to compete with Britain which at the time was a head in the field
 of most industries. America at this time was a  country  which  wanted  to
 embrace  Industrial  Revolution and they certainly had the right sought of
 people. At the Great Exhibition there was  an  American  gun  manufacturer
 Smith and Wesson which was unrivalled in the field of Gun making.
 <BR><BR>
 The  Great  Exhibition  through  encouraging  the  masses to come and see,
 educated the masses and also educated the aristocracy as  to  how  exactly
 the  working  classes do behave. That the working classes were not all the
 louts and ignorant people they had by  many  people  assumed  to  be.  The
 working  class  did  themselves  a  great  service  by  visiting the great
 Exhibition as this showed a willingness to learn and their behaviour  once
 the  were  there  was such that it was seen that maybe the working classes
 could be trusted with things like he vote. It is important to clarify that
 peoples  prejudice  towards  the  working classes didn't change overnight.
 After the five months the Great Exhibition had been open £186,000 had been
 raised  and  the money went into developing the museums and Royal colleges
 which can be found in South Kensington.
 <BR><BR>
 The Great Exhibition of 1851 was of immense importance to the historian as
 such  a lot can be learned from its study. The Exhibition was a display of
 the worlds industry it was the work of a royal person and its effects were
 important  and  far  reaching. The exhibition itself was a succesful money
 making venture and on the outside with the increased exports and the force
 with  which Britain had prooved beyond any shadow of a doubt that it ruled
 the Industrial world seem to be exactly  what  it  was  aimed  to  be.  In
 reality  though  the  Great Exhibition gave the world a chance to catch up
 and exceed the abilities of Britain.
