<H3>Richard Fletcher  </H3>

<H4>I would like to hear from other Amigans, and perhaps start a reqular
correspondance. I'm 17 and studying for my A-Levels.<br><br>

My main intrests are reading, and talking about the validity of Communism.
My personal view is that Communism is good in an ideal world but Communism
breaks down after a short time due to the ability people have to bend the
beliefs of others. I dislike tabloids a lot. I mainly read Science Fiction, but
I'm not a fan of the various Space-Operas, such as B5 and Start Trek.
Musically I like Radiohead, Pavement, Blur, Billy Bragg, Catatonia, Ben
Folds Five and REM. My taste is quite wide, but liking music is not a
prerequisite for writing to me.
<br><br>
The only thing I ask is to make any letter you might send slightly
interesting and a little longer than "Spot the Dog" books. Do you remeber
Spot?
<br><br>
My Address is 49 Clifton Cresent, Frodsham, Cheshire, WA6 7PW.
