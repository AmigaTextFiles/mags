<P>If You have not read the introduction to our group, then do so 
<A HREF="ps_intro.html">now</A>.

<P><TABLE BORDER ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=100%>

<TR><TD BGCOLOR=#E0B080><B>Programmers...</B>

<TD BGCOLOR=#F0C080><BR>Membership is completely free; as a member, you will be put in contact with like minded people. If you are working on a project that requires additional help, whether you need more programmers, or graphics artists, musicians, beta testers etc, then be sure to check us out. Or maybe you just want to swap source code, or are interested in beta testing projects under development.

<P>Here are some of the things that we can provide:<UL><DD>
<LI>We will put you in contact (via email) of other members who use the same language as you and (if possible) the same programming interests as you. Share ideas, source code, tips, etc.
<LI>We will do our best to put people in contact if they are needing each other's services, for example, a programmer looking for a graphics artist. We can also put requests onto our webpage if you are having trouble finding people.
<LI>Need advice or want to give some? We will try to help you 
on particular problems.
<LI>Receive the Amiga e-zine DoubleClick. Released every three months or so, this has news, views, reviews, tutorials, information and more. Also the oppurtunity to submit articles to DoubleClick, of course.
<LI>Have your programs beta-tested by other members, and if you wish, do some beta-testing yourself.
<LI>Submit details of your programs to us; we will advertise the list on these homepages, in DoubleClick, Aminet, and also produce a file (AmigaGuide and plain text format) which should be included in members' programs (ie, advertising for each other).
<LI>Have you homepage linked from our site.
</UL><DL>

<P>As you can see, a lot of this is members helping each other - the idea is that we aren't doing anything in particular, we are just providing an easy means whereby people can easily get in contact with each other.<BR>

<TR><TD BGCOLOR=#E0B080><B>Beta Testers...</B>

<TD BGCOLOR=#F0C080><BR>You can also join as a beta tester - even if you know nothing about programming. Don't worry about commitment; you can choose to beta test as many or as few programs as you like, and you can select a particular type of program to test. In return for this, you can get:<UL><DD>
<LI>A unique opportunity to look at a variety of quality shareware and freeware software before it is released.
<LI>Grateful authors usually give free registration and discounts on shareware and upgrades, along with possibly other goodies.
<LI>The chance to contribute your time to help enthusiastic programmers who are aiming to produce low cost software and support the Amiga.</UL><DL><BR>

<TR><TD BGCOLOR=#E0B080><B>Other Members...</B>

<TD BGCOLOR=#F0C080><BR>We would also like to hear from other people, who are not programmers, but are interested in getting involved in program design. For example, graphics artists, musicians, game designers.

<P>Also, we would be pleased to hear from anyone interested in contributing to the E-Zine DoubleClick on a regular basis (be it tutorials, reviews, views or whatever). Additionally, we would be pleased to have BBS sysops join. In return for holding the latest issue of DoubleClick and information about PentriSoft on your board, we will advertise your BBS in DoubleClick, and on this site.

<P>Of course, you can join for more than one purpose!<BR>

<TR><TD BGCOLOR=#E0B080><B>General</B>

<TD BGCOLOR=#F0C080><BR>Membership is completely free, and by joining you don't commit yourself to anything - you have nothing to lose.

<P>When you are a member, here are some things we ask you to do. You don't have to do this, of course, but it would be nice; it helps everyone, and there's no point joining if you're going to be like that...<UL><DD>
<LI>Indicate that you are a member of PentriSoft in your programs (for programmers, that is). If possible, include our logo, along with a small text file (which we will send you about PentriSoft.
<LI>We produce a list of members' programs, with brief descriptions, in both Amigaguide and plain text formats. We would 
appreciate it if you could include this file in your program (if appropriate - it is wasteful to include this file on uploads to Aminet), on your homepage (if you have one), send it to friends, put on your BBS (if you are joining as a BBS sysop), etc.
<LI>Put a link to us on your homepage, if you have one. We're 
put a link to yours, so it's only fair!
</UL><DL>

<P>Upon joining, you will receive various bits, including some logos for you to use, a small text file explaining briefly about PentriSoft (for you to include in your programs, send to other people, etc), and anymore up to date information about the group. We will also give you the email addresses of some like minded users. We'll then ask you if you want to submit details of your programs which can then be advertised far and wide...

<P>So...

<P><B>What are you waiting for?</B>
