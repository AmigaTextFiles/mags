<P>We've all heard about Amiga games not appearing in computer shops, and all that, but what about books?

<P>I remember years ago, a bookshop would have loads of Amiga related books in its computer section, a good shelf or two. Now, sadly, to find a single book would be a challenge.

<P>Of course, the demand has gone down in recent years, but surely there is still <I>some</I> demand? Well, we know there is of course.

<P>Put it another way, you always get at least a shelf or two devoted to Windows NT. Sure, NT may be pretty much the standard when it comes to workstations these days, but you have to wonder just how many people coming through those shop doors have their own personal workstation in their back room...

<P>As for books being available, well there are still Amiga books 
being produced. And any publishers that stopped producing Amiga books presumably were persuaded by the fact that Amiga books weren't getting onto the shelves, a chicken and egg situation.

<P>The last Amiga related book I saw on a shelf was a Lightwave book, which brings me to another point. For years, the only 3D books I saw were devoted to 3D Studio, no Lightwave in sight despite the fact that it is the industry standard. I presume that 
now you can get Lightwave on the PC, it is considered 'acceptable' to have a Lightwave book on display. I guess there's 
no hope of a Video Toaster book, then.

<P>The situation could be helped in all sorts of ways. Amiga users nagging book stores to get some Amiga books for starters. More importantly, Gateway 2000 could do a lot to help the situation. Maybe having some books about the AmigaOS written to coincide with the release of OS 3.5 (if or when it finally comes out...) and making sure these are available in book stores.

<P>In many ways, books in bookstores is more important than games 
in shops, as it shows the serious side of the computer, rather than just games.
