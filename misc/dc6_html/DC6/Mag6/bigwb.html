<P>I'm currently running my Workbench screen in 1024x768... <I>without</I> a graphics card! So how is this possible?

<P>It's thanks to two excellent pieces of Amiga freeware: HighGFX 
and Magic TV. Note that you need a 30kHz capable Monitor for this.

<P>HighGFX gives you new screen modes; 512x192, 512x384, 512x768 (interlaced), 1024x384, 1024x384, 1024x768 (interlaced).

<P>A nice set of new modes. Normally with AGA, the most you can get is 640x512 (DblPAL), with a little flicker, and 640x480 (Multiscan) with no flicker. But 1024x768 is all very well, but what about the horrendous interlace flicker?

<P>Enter MagicTV, the software flicker fixer. I couldn't believe it when I first saw it, but it works! Even without HighGFX, MagicTV lets you use 800x600 (Super72) without flicker, but now you can have 1024x768!

<P>There are limitations, though. Firstly, there is still a little bit of flicker, certainly noticeable compared to a 640x480 
screen. But considering the huge increase in resolution, it is worth it.

<P>More significantly, MagicTV only works with 16 colour screens, 
so although this is okay for screens like Workbench, word processors, and so on, you'll have to forget any ideas of running 
Photogenics in 1024x768. Also, MagicTV slight modifies the colours, making them look rather 'duller' than normal.

<P>Nonetheless, running 1024x768 is a huge advantage, despite the 
limitations. An added bonus for users of the Microvitec M1438 monitor, like myself, is that most screens (including 640x480, and expecially 640x512) don't fill the monitor screen space; there are blank gaps to the left and right of the Amiga screen. Not so with 1024x768, it completely fills the screen space.
