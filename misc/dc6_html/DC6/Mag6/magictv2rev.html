<P>I reviewed version 1.3 of this in issue 5 under the Patches section, but now it has been updated, and I decided to have another look at it.

<P>What is it? A software flicker fixer describes it all, really - and it works! If you're using a TV, you can now view 640x512 without any flicker. If you have a monitor, you can use modes like 800x600 with out burning your eyes out.

<P>Okay, it doesn't work with everything. Firstly, only 8 or 16 colour screens are supported. Also, it has the effect of 'dulling' the colours, so it doesn't look quite right. Nonetheless, this is a small price to pay, in my opinion.

<P>As you can see from the name, it is still a beta version. It claims to be bug free, but don't believe it. Admittedly, this is a beta version, but it is still something to be aware of. There seems to be problems whenever there is a change in the screen palette; the screen blanks completely; sometimes, you are lucky, and the screen returns to normal, but other times, it just crashes your system completely. It has particular problems with the error flash/beep on the Workbench screen. So much so, I no longer use it for Workbench, but it seems okay for the likes of WordWorth and SoundStudio.

<P>Other limitations are that the mouse is turned to black (not really a problem, and it may be fixed in future), and you cannot choose which screens are affected (this may change in future, also).

<P>Another problem is that with Shapeshifter, the Mac screen is, well, invisible. It reacts to the mouse, but I cannot see it! Again, not a problem, as I am now running SS in 256 colours, thanks to the <A HREF="savagereview.html">Savage driver</A>.

<P>Other improvements have been made since the previous 1.3 version. Apparantely, no CPU time is used, except when changing palettes. Also, before there was a pause when dragging or switching screens before the interlace was fixed - you do not see 
this now.

<P>All in all, a very promising piece of software, and I look forward to future versions.
