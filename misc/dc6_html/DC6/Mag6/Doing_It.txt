The Canonical List of DO IT lines (AKA Everybody Does It)

As we know EVERYBODY DOES IT; it is just a matter of how and with what.

This  list contains lines about people of different professions,   and  in
fact  a  few  individuals,  who "Do It".  Now this list can  be  taken  as
pointers  on how people have sex,  but that is not necessarily  the  case.
Please remember this if you want to submit items to be added to the  list.
None are to be blatent sexual methods.

Thanks to those who started this list (several times over) and continue
to contribute to it.  Sorry, but I don't know who was first, nor does it
really matter.
