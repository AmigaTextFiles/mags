Wanted - Blank Disks are in great need.  I prefer Double Density  ones  as
         High Density can be a bit dodgy on the Amiga.  Do you want to get 
         rid  of all those  old magazine coverdisks that are  lying at the 
    bottom  of  your drawers (Not trousers!)?  You do? Well give them 
         to me!  I can use  them to buy  more  Public Domain Disks,  which 
    will keep my  spending costs lower and allow me to buy  much more 
    high quality programs,  which  you can swap with me.  Either post  
    me  the disks if you are feeling generous,  or tell  how many you 
    have to spare and how much you  want for them and I will consider
    your offer.  Please make the  price cheap,  as I want to keep the 
    PD scene alive.  Thanks  for your help. I may be  willing to swap 
    blank disks for blank disk  labels,  as I buy my labels  in bulk, 
    so I have loads.

Do  you want a great looking letterheading for typing letters to all  your
friends.  I am able to design practically anything you want, incorporating
clipart  pictures,  and any logos you want to supply.  I can unfortunately
only  supply letterheadings in Wordworth V4 or V5 format.  I can  also  do
final printing,  although I would prefer just to send you the files, ready
for  use.  I will of course,  supply fonts etc,  so that the letterheading
will look the same on your computer as on mine.  I do not have V6 yet,  so
cannot design watermarks.  Send £1.50 for samples, or two DD floppy disks.
Price according to requirements.
