<P>DoubleClick is available from various sources now...

<UL>
<LI><B>Aminet</B> - both html and amigaguide versions will be uploaded to docs/mags as soon as the mag is completed, <B>under the name 'DCx_Guide.lha' and 'DCx_HTML.lha', where x is the issue number</B>, so check those recent lists! The html versions will from now on need a web browser (but just download a freeware one). Also, the amigaguide version on aminet requires you to decompress onto hard disk; if you only have a floppy drive, then get the disk version. You can also download issues from other places including: <A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/~Mark_Harman">http://members.tripod.com/~Mark_Harman</A> (Mark's homepage).
<LI><B>Online</B> - The latest issue is now available online.
<LI><A HREF="inetsub.html"><B>Internet Subscription</B></A> - the 
best way for those with an email address, we can either email you each issue, or simply tell you when a new issue is ready (all totally free, of course).
<LI><A HREF="Subs.html"><B>Postal Subscription</B></A> - the best way for readers without internet access. Again, from now on the full/html version really requires a web browser, but there's also 
the guide version needing just WB2.
<LI><B><A HREF="TI_BBS.html">Transmission Impossible BBS</A></B> - DMS files of both versions will be available here!
<LI><B><A HREF="TI_BBS.html">BrainScan BBS</A></B> - Each issue is also available here!
<LI><B>CD ROM</B> - It ought to find its way onto the Aminet CDs of course, and we will be sending each issue to CU Amiga for there coverCD (and maybe Amiga Format too), but this takes time, and the may issues will be out of date by a few months.
<LI><B>PD Libraries</B> - of course may get hold of it. In particular, Stephen will probably send copies to <B>Amicom PD</B>.
<LI><B>Other People</B> - Remember that DC is completely freeware, so feel free to copy it to all your contacts, and spread it everywhere!
