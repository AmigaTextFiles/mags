<P>We now present two new services for those with email addresses (and if you can get regular Internet access, but don't have an email, then just apply to Hotmail!)

<P>For the first service, we send you each issue as it is completed by email. Just <A HREF="mailto:mdwh2@cam.ac.uk">email Mark on mdwh2@cam.ac.uk</A>, requesting to be sent each issue, and please state whether you want the HTML or Amigaguide version.

<P>But we realise that not everyone wants 700k emails cluttering up their inbox! Maybe you would rather download at a later date, or perhaps you would like to view the issue online. In this case, 
it is still convenient to know when a new issue is ready. With this second service, we will send you a quick email telling you when each new issue is produced. Just <A HREF="mailto:mdwh2@cam.ac.uk">email Mark on mdwh2@cam.ac.uk</A> asking us to do this.
