<HTML><H2><B>DoubleClick's Review Policy</B></H2>

<P>As always, we have a selection of products reviewed for this issue, but this is the first issue that we've set up a standard ratings system, and actually given scores. Hopefully this we provide a better way of comparing products (although we hope you'd still read the review too!) Here are some things to note...

<P>Obviously, we can't afford to review every new product, nor will the average DC reviewer have as much experience with products as 'commercial' magazine reviewers. Nonetheless, we hope 
you'll find a reviews useful as a alternative viewpoint, which we think is always useful.

<P>You may notice (especially in the PD section) that we usually give out good reviews. That's not because we like everything, but 
more that out of all the PD to review, we only select the good programs... if there's a PD program that isn't any good, we won't slag it of for the sake of it, just not review it.
