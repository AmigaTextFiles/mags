<H1><B><CENTER>Amiga's 22nd Century Bug!</CENTER></B></H1>

<P>Forget the millenium bug - we all know that the Amiga has nothing to fear from such trivial problems. But a hundred years later, things could be different.

<P>As the clock ticks from 31st December 2099 to 1st January 2100, at first things seem okay: No smoke fanning out of the floppy drive, no spontaneously exploding CPUs, and the clock ticks happily onwards.

<P>But what's this? The Time Preferences program won't have it! When you run it, it will display the year 2100 or whatever, but as soon as you enter a new date in, it won't let you enter 2100 or beyond. If you do, it just changes it to 2099!

<P>So while Amigas may tick onto the 22nd Century, don't even think about running that Time prefs program.

<P>I hope Amiga International give us an OS update before 2100...
