<HTML>If you wish to send us an article, then please bear in mind the following points:
<BR><UL>
<LI>Now we have the 'Articles, Other' section, you can really send in anything. You might like to consider: Tutorials, Reviews, Reference/Information, Views, Downloaded Web Pages, among others.
<LI>If you are doing a programming article, any listings of program code should be commented as much as possible.
<LI>It's even better if you supply source code as a separate file.
<LI>We will try to accept all submissions, though we reserve the right to refuse any submissions.
<LI>We reserve the right to edit any of the material that we receive (although we probably won't, except for formatting/HTML tags, etc).
<LI>Please send the text in standard ASCII format, on either an Amiga (or PC) disk, to <A HREF="contacts.html">Mark or Stephen (click for addresses)</A>. Alternatively, you can send text articles via email to Mark at <B>mdwh2@cam.ac.uk</B>. Also, you can upload submissions to the <A HREF="TI_BBS.html">Transmission Impossible BBS</A>.
<LI>If you want any graphics or special effects happening in your article, include the relevant files, and explain clearly what you want; I may be able to handle it, as long as it's not too wierd!
<LI>I will also accept articles on paper <B>within reason</B>. I have better things to do than type in a several thousand word article...
