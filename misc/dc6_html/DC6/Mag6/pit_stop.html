Neston, Cheshire.

<P>A scheme asking motorists to "shop" trucks producing black exhaust
smoke and make ownders face fines of up to &#163;5,000 has been attacked by
lorry operators. The RAC is urging Britain's drivers to report
polluting vehicles by giving registrations and company names to the
Vehicle Inspectorate. But former Transport Minister Steven Norris,
now Director General of the Road Haulage Association blasted: "It's
amazing to see such a selective policy from the RAC.".

<P>In Kitzingen, Germany, Peter Hanser came out of a divorce court and
smashed the headlamps and windows of what he thought was his ex-wife's

caused damage worth &#163;3,000.

<P>A hard core of drivers are still risking other road users' lives,
festive drink drive figures revealed. Now police cheifs, backed by
the AA and RAC, are urging the Government to rethink future campaigns.
The breath test failure rate in England and Wales was nine per cent -
far higher than the five per cent reported last year. But there was
welcome relief in Scotland, where failures fell from 0.8 per cent to
0.5 per cent.

<P>Fast food loving motorists are causing traffic chaos on the Isle of
Man. McDonald's opened its first drive in restaurant there recently,
and police are now warning drivers to expect hour long queues as half
mile jams build up in the main town of Douglas.

<P>A pensioner terrified drivers on the M25 by doing 20 mph in the fast
lane - in the WRONG direction! Motorists swerved to miss the 84 year
old, who thought he was in the slow lane on the other side.

<P>Unlucky pilot Otto Breckmann had to make an emergency landing on a
busy highway near Dusseldorf, Germany, and was immediately fined &#163;65

23 accidents in Florida, USA, because he needs cushions to see over
the dash.

<P>A law allowing Washington DC police to confiscate kerb crawlers cars
proved so successful that it was expanded to include suspected drug
dealers. But both schemes have been suspended, as the city car pounds
are now full.

<P>And finally, I had to include this letter that I read in the March
issue of Max Power, which has to be the funniest car magazine this
side of a Skoda Quality Control Report! This magazine represents the
best &#163;2.95 that you could spend each month, and goes from strength to
strength, even though there is not as much "totty" as there used to
be, probably due to the female editor (Sorry, Emma!). Well, anyway,
here goes:

<P><B>Crazy Horses</B>

<P>I don't really know what the term "Brake Horsepower" stands for. What
does it mean? Meanwhile, can I take this opportunity to congratulate
you on your excellent vid. Watching it gave me great pleasure
(Wa##er! - RS). S Williams, W Yorkshire.

<P><B>The reply:</B>

<P>Right, sit down and pay attention. The term "Brake Horsepower", more
commonly known as BHP comes from the highly technical performance
testing the manufacturers carry out. Once the car's been built, a
skilled test driver takes the vehicle to a top secret proving ground
where a horse is tied to the back of the car. The back of the horse
is then tied to a solid object - normally a lamp post. The driver
then selects forst gear and dials in about 4000 rpm before side
stepping the clutch and letting rip, so "braking" the horse in two in
the process. The test is repeated, increasing the number of horses
each time. When the number of horses becomes too much for the car to
"brake" then you have reached your "brake horsepower" figure. For
example an Aston Martin Vantage can "brake" 550 horses at one time.
Hope this has cleared things up for you and glad you enjoyed the vid -
SG.

<P>By the way, SG is not me, but is either Stupid Gallagher or Sir Gavin,
two of the staff writers on the mag.
