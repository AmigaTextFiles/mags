<H1><B><CENTER>Amiga Diary for 1997</CENTER></B></H1>

<P>1997 is over, and what a year it was! It began with the Amiga situation getting worse and worse. Escom had gone bust, Viscorp had no money to buy the Amiga after all, and even if they or Quikpak did buy the Amiga, these were companies nobody had heard of, and only had interests in using the Amiga for niche markets.

<P>Along come Gateway 2000, and surprise everyone. Almost a year later, I am still hesitant to say whether they will do good things for the Amiga, but I feel far more confident about them than I did Escom, this time two years ago.

<P>So let's have a look at the highlights for the Amiga of 1997...
