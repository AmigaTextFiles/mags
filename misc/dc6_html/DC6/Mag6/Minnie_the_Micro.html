<P>Micro  was a real-time operator and dedicated multi-user.  His  broad-
band  protocol  made  it  easy  for him  to  interface  with  numerous
input/output devices, even if it meant time-sharing.

<P>One  evening he arrived home just as the Sun was crashing,  and parked
his  Motorola 68000 in the main drive (he had missed the S100 bus that
morning),   when he noticed an elegant piece of liveware admiring  the
daisy wheels in his garden.  He thought to himself,  "She looks  user-
friendly, I'll see if she wants an update tonight".

<P>Mini was her name,  and she was delightfully engineered with eyes like
COBOL  and a Prime mainframe architecture that set Micro's peripherals
networking all over the place.

<P>He browsed over to her casually,  admiring the power of her twin,  32-
bit  floating  point  processors  (whilst  dreaming  of  nibbling  her
floppies),  and enquired "How are you Honeywell?".  "Yes,  I am well",
she  responded,  batting her optical fibres engagingly  and  smoothing
her console over her curvilinear functions.

<P>Micro  settled for a straight line approximation.  "I'm a  stand-alone
tonight",  he said.  "How about computing a vector to my base address,
I'll  output a byte to eat,  and maybe we could get offset later  on."
Mini  ran  a  priority process for 2.6 milli-seconds then  transmitted
"8k,   I've been dumped myself just recently,  and a new page is  just
what  I need to refresh my discs.  I'll park my machine-cycle in  your
background  and  meet  you  inside." She walked  off,   leaving  Micro
admiring her solenoids and thinking,  "Wow,  what a global variable, I
wonder if she'll like my firmware."

<P>They  sat down at the look-up table to a line-feed of fiche and  chips
and a bucket of bits.  Mini was in conversational mode and expanded on
ambiguous  arguments  while  Micro  gave  occasional  acknowledgements
although,   in  reality,   he was analysing  the  shortest  and  least
critical  path  to  her entry point.  He finally settled  on  the  old
"would  you like to see my benchmark subroutine?" but Mini  was  again
one step ahead.

<P>Suddenly  she was up and stripping off her parity bits to  reveal  the
full functionality of her operating system software.  "Let's go Basic,
you Ram." she said.  Micro was loaded at this stage,  but his hardware
polling  module  had a processor of it's own  and  was  in  danger  of
overflowing it's output buffer, a hang-up that Micro had consulted his
analyst about. "Core!" was all he could say.

<P>Micro  soon recovered,  however,  when she went down on  the  Dec  and
opened  her  devices files to reveal her data set ready.  He  accessed
his  root  device  and was just about to start pushing  into  her  CPU
stack, when she attempted an escape sequence.

<P>"No, no!" she piped.  "You're not shielded."

<P>"Reset, baby", he replied.  "I've been debugged."

<P>"But I haven't got my current loop enabled, and I can't 
support a child process", she protested.

<P>"Don't run away", he said.  "I'll generate an interrupt".

<P>"No,   that's  too error prone,  and can abort because  of  my  design
philosophy."

<P>Micro  was  locked in by this stage though,  and could not  be  turned
off.   But  she  soon stopped his thrashing by introducing  a  voltage
spike into his mains supply,  whereupon he fell over with a head crash
and went to sleep.

<P>"Computers",  she said as she compiled herself.  "All they every think
of is Hex."
