<TR><TD BGCOLOR=#E0B080><B>Overview</B>

<TD BGCOLOR=#F0C080><BR>PentriSoft is an internet user group aimed at supporting programmers. It doesn't matter if you're just starting to learn to program, or are raking in thousands from your latest shareware, or even commercial, release, we cater for all.

<P>We also have members who are not necessarily programmers, but are interested in other aspects of program production; graphics artists, musicians, designers, and beta testers.

<P>Other people, such as article writers for the E-Zine DoubleClick, BBS sysops, etc, are welcome to 
join, also - see later for more details.

<P>Note that at the time of writing (Feb '98), PentriSoft is a rather new development, at least in this current form (see History for more details), so initially, please bear with me while everything gets sorted out!<BR>

<TR><TD BGCOLOR=#E0B080><B>History</B>

<TD BGCOLOR=#F0C080><BR>Paradoxically, PentriSoft is being presented here as something new... while at the same time being almost 4 years old. Let me explain.

<P><B>Late 1994</B> - My friend, Steph Gray, comes up with this idea of a user group for shareware/freeware Mac programmers, and names it PentriSoft.

<P><B>1995</B> - PentriSoft is set up on the Mac by Steph, mainly 
utilising the Internet. I do not have Internet access at the time, and although I belong to PentriSoft as an Amiga programmer, I don't set about recruiting any more members on the Amiga.

<P><B>Early 1996</B> - I decide to set up PentriSoft on the Amiga, and place some adverts in <I>Amiga Shopper</I>. Unfortunately, relying on postal mail rather than email proves to 
be harder than I had anticipated. I make some contacts, but I am unable to do a great deal. Meanwhile, I am also thinking of the idea of a diskmag; initially, this is to be a joint Mac and Amiga 
magazine, called DoubleClick, but the joint never happened. Instead, I carried on with an Amiga only diskmag.

<P><B>Mid 1996</B> - DoubleClick issue one is released onto an unsuspecting world, and the various PentriSoft members. It makes use of a self coded viewing engine. A few more members. As for the Mac side of PentriSoft, Steph tells me he has handed control over to someone else.

<P><B>Late 1996</B> - DoubleClick issue two is released. Meanwhile, issue one is reviewed in <I>Amiga Format</I>; they say 
it has one of the best interfaces they have seen, and could become 'the ultimate diskmag'. I decide to concentrate on DoubleClick, and PentriSoft is pushed to a dark corner. Meanwhile, some guy from Scotland who goes by the name of Stephen 
Graham writes to me asking for a copy of issue one.

<P><B>Early 1997</B> - DoubleClick issue three is released. Stephen is providing me with lots of material, and I decide to make him a co-editor.

<P><B>Mid 1997</B> - Issue four arrives, after a long wait this time (I had exams). Meanwhile, nothing happens in PentriSoft (and 
apparantely, not too much has been happening in the Mac side, either).

<P><B>Late 1997</B> - I start uni! And although I don't have Internet access from my Amiga, I can still get access and email from the college computers. Issue five of DoubleClick is released, this time in both HTML and Amigaguide formats, and for the first time available on Aminet. I start thinking about PentriSoft again, and the prospects offered by using the Internet.

<P><B>Early 1998</B> - Issue six of DoubleClick is soon to released, and will also be available on its own web site. I also set about ressurrecting the idea of PentriSoft on the Amiga... that's now!

<P>So, despite this long history, PentriSoft's life has only just begun... come and join now!<BR>
