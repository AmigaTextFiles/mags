<P><B>Issue One</B> - August 1996. The very first issue. Main features are Escom/Commodore Takeover analysis, and start of two series of articles: Sprite Movement and Amiga History.

<P><B>Issue Two</B> - November 1996. Completely new viewer for OS3/HD users, loads more articles.

<P><B>Issue Three</B> - March 1997. Hopefully you'll agree that it improves with even more articles. Unfortunately, there were problems with the full version, but they should now all be fixed.

<P><B>Issue Four</B> - August 1997. Blimey, quite a wait from issue 3! But worth the wait, I'm sure... Stephen Graham joins as editor. The first issue to be fully HTML compatible, and also the first to be distributed in AmigaGuide format as the Lite version.

<P><B>Issue Five</B> - November 1997. A smaller issue this time, but don't let that put you off. A web browser is now the prefered option when using the HTML version.

<P><B>Issue Six</B> - March 1998. Up to a slightly larger size. As well as the HTML version, the Amigaguide version has been replaced by a plain text version. This is the first issue to appear online at http://members.tripod.com/~DoubleClick_Mag

<P><B><A HREF="NextIssue.html">Issue Seven</A></B> - Sometime Early Summer, 1998
