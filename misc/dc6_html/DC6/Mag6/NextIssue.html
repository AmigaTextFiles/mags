<P>Issue 7 will be springing up on an Aminet site near you, on its own web site, and elsewhere sometime later in this year of 1998. Contributions most welcome, as always ;)

<P>Hopefully, you can expect a redesigned interface, making it much easier to navigate your way around the mag. We are currently 
in conference with Richard Fletcher who has sent us designs of a greatly improved HTML engine - watch out for it!

<P>Anyway, there's plenty to read in this issue, so what are you doing staring at this page?
