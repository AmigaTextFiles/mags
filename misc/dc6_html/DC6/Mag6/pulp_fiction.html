The Soundtrack and Other Stuff</H1><BR>
 
<H3>by Alan Graham</H3><BR></CENTER>

The intriguing and explosive script of Pulp Fiction is one 
possible reason for its phenomenal success in the last few years, 
but it could also be said that Tarantino's choice of music is 
reason enough to love the film.<P>

Due to this MCA released the soundtrack some time ago, with 
all the songs of the film, and some script extracts as well.  
These include the complete "Ezekiel 25:17" exerpt (with 
gunshots and Brett's scream), and the "Royale with cheese" 
scene.  There is also short introductions to many of the songs, 
such as the compere at the "Jack Rabbit Slims Twist Contest" 
leading on to Chuck Berry's "You never can tell".<P>

Even the little ditty that is on Bruce Willis's radio is present, 
although it is really a love-it-or-hate-it tune.<P>

This can be said about most of the CD:  If you have a wide 
taste in music and like most 60's and 70's stuff, then I cannot 
recommend this more.  However, if you believe that the Spice 
Girls are the best group in the world, or refuse to listen to 
anything but Oasis, then stay away.  I will let you decide which 
group I fall into.<P>

Anyway, here is a quick run-down of the tunes:<P>

I could not give a true favourite, although I dislike many of the 
first few tracks.  The CD lasts over 40 minutes, and should not 
cost more than a tenner.<P>

This is a bit odd, but never mind!!

To round off, here is a list of some clever parts of the script, 
that I can remember (I am recalling all this, so do not blame 
me for errors).<P>
<HR><BR>

Although both occurences of the restaurant robbery were 
meant to be the same, Honey Bunny shouts different warnings 
in each one.<P>

Apparently, you can see Vincent going to the toilet in the first 
robbery.<P>

The code to Brett's briefcase (technically Marcellus Wallace's 
briefcase) was 666, and many people have said that the case 
contained Marcellus's soul and that this is the reason for the 
Elastoplast on the back of his neck....<P>

.....the "real" reason being that the actor that played Marcellus 
had a scar there, and Tarantino had to disguise it somehow.<P>

Another rumour over the case contents was that it was an Oscar 
for Mia, that had been arranged to cheer her up, due to her 
show not being aired - this is due to the gold glow from the 
case.<P>

When Mia gets her adrenaline shot, there are games such as 
"Operation" and "Game of Life" in the background.<P>

When Vincent reaches Mia's house, he is told by Mia to go to 
the intercom in the wall to talk, but she had already heard 
what he said in the middle of the living room, so why did he 
need to go to the intercom?<P>

In Reservoir Dogs, the diamonds were to be fenced by a guy 
called "Marsellus", "Mr. Wallace" or something similar.  Also, a 
Vic (Vincent) Vega was mentioned, but I cannot remember 
where.<P>

There is supposedly a similar reference in From Dusk Till Dawn, 
but I cannot remember any more, or where I heard it from.  If 
any readers do know the reference, please write in.<P>
