*** Welcome to the AO update, volume 1, issue 3 - 17 Sept. 1999 ***
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*** AO Update is a free weekly newsletter provided by Amiga.org ***
*** to tell you what is happening in the Amiga community.	***
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, ok,

I know I just sent out the AO Update on Monday, but I really want 
to get beck into the habit of doing the updates on Fridays if I can
help it.  It gives us all something to read and think about over 
the weekend.  As a result, there are only 5 days news listed in 
this update to include some we missed posting to the last edition.

If this is a problem, please feel free to let us know. (Send mail 
to webmaster@amiga.org)

-----
"Final Fury" (or AI's news since Monday)
-----
Since Monday's AO Update, two new Executive Updates were posted 
on Amiga's site by CEO Tom Schmidt.  The first, admittedly vague
and elusive was countered by a second Update posted this morning.
In this morning's update, Mr. Schmidt takes a more direct approach 
to answering several questions that had been plaguing the 
community since last Friday's mysterious Business Week article.

Please, read it.  While it doesn't tell all, or even clear up
every question you might have, it does clearly state their 
intentions.  For example, it clearly stipulates that Amiga will 
NOT build their own MCC / ATX computer, *but* they welcome any
third party company that wants to license the MCC / ATX and build
them. (can someone say "Gateway"?)

Already, the online community appears strongly divided.  Whether 
or not you like Amiga's new direction depends on whether you are 
willing to accept a complete paradigm shift.  Said shift in 
thinking has come from the fact that future Amiga technology will
exist in every information appliance, not merely as a desktop 
computer.

To quote Bill McEwen's 1998 Sacramento speech,
----
"we aren't building anything"

"we're going to design the technology, then license it to others to 
use"

"this will let us get our technology into millions of devices, 
instead of thousands of desktops."

"we can't win by building a non-standard desktop computer then 
taking on Microsoft and Gateway."

"Even a large company like Gateway 2000, the world's largest PC 
seller would be eaten alive if Microsoft and Intel saw us coming."
----

I will openly admit that it wasn't in their best interest to "tease" 
the community with dreams of ATX motherboards and MCC's in every 
room.  The promise of hardware, then the abrupt death of that 
promise has seriously degraded the morale, if not population, of 
our already fragile community.  The funny thing is, factually,
hardly anything has changed at Amiga.  Most of the fury was driven 
by speculation and rumor.

If you will allow, I personally liked and respected Jim Collas, for
both his qualifications on paper, and his great great ability for 
public speech the few times I was lucky enough to witness it.  In
retrospect however, I wonder how much of the problems we're seeing
today are because of the fact that his dream (ATX/MCC) was such a
variation on the Amiga plans circa 1998 (pre-Collas).

Collas came on board, and like a PR whirlwind he lauded the 
community for it's tenacity, "promised" us the replacement for our 
current Amigas that we wanted, and told us (perhaps too much) how 
he wanted to get us there.  I quoted "promise" because after 
reviewing the speeches and updates, I can't find a single place 
where he said anything about AMIGA building the hardware themselves
(except as a limited run for developers).

Just as suddenly, Collas was gone, and the "plan" remains the same 
as it's 1998 roots.  Amiga won't build hardware, they'll build 
technology and license it out to hardware companies.

Why?  Well for this week's history lesson, let's take Apple's not-
so-forgotten licensing scheme.  Amiga is a technology company.  
They don't build machines, they design and license  software and 
hardware to third-party companies.  

Apple failed because when they started licensing clones, they 
ended up competing against the very people who were paying them 
for licenses.  In most cases, Mac licensees were able to undercut 
Apple's pricing on the real Macintosh machines.  As a result, no 
one bought clones because they wanted real Macs but couldn't 
afford them.  Likewise, those that did buy Mac clones, cut 
severely into Apple's profit margin..

In the end, it's best not to repeat your enemy's failures I think.

Sincerely, and see you next Friday,

Wayne Hunt
Site Manager,
Amiga.org
