Editor's Corner             by @{"Lori Vinciguerra" link P6}

The "Schools with Amigas" list has reached 100 with the addition of two new
schools this quarter.  Unfortunately we have lost the Orange Coast College
in Costa Mesa, California from our list.  John Hanna informed me that the
decision to get rid of the Amigas was based on many factors, including the
lack of hardware and software vendor support.  They have decided to buy
Macs and may even add some UNIX workstations to their graphics program.  I
am particularly aware of the hesitant attitudes of US vendors and dealers
to jump back into the Amiga market.  It seems to me that the vendors who
stayed involved are definately devoted and provide excellent support.
However, even some of the new Amiga retail stores are not carrying much
inventory. Their reply to requests from potential customers is that Amigans
buy primarily from mail order.  Everyone who is interested in having good
local support from the dealers should be visiting their stores even if it
is just to browse.  The dealers need to know that when we want to buy
something or have something repaired we will support the local retail shop.

Other evidence of vendor uneasiness is the delay of AC's Guide which was
due to come out first in the fall and then in winter.  The delay, as I
understand it, is due to the lack of content for the publication.  I agree
that it would look bad to put out a very thin issue of the Guide.  However,
this delay is making current and future Amiga customers feel like things
are still up in the air.  Hopefully, the delay will be resolved soon.

Since the last issue of the AEL newsletter, the World Wide Web has really
taken off.  In this issue, look for Ralph Vinciguerra's article on
preparing material for the Web. Also, check out OWL's Web site (address
listed in article).  We have links to some of the cool places that an
Amigan would want to travel. Access to this newsletter will be added to the
Web site soon.

We will be cutting down on the number of paper copies of the newsletter
that are sent by US mail.  If you are still interested in receiving it by
US mail, please send me a quick note.  I am hoping that most people will be
able to receive it electronically.  The duplication and mailing costs (and
the time it took to format it) were just getting to be too much.

The deadline for article submissions for the summer issue is June 1,
1996.  Articles about anything that you are doing with your Amiga that
is related to education would be great. As always, email your article to
owl@davinci.reading.ma.us or use U.S. mail to send to OWL Software, 460
Summer Ave., Reading, MA 01867-3819.

The October 1995 issue of "Internet World" was dedicated to using the
Internet in education.  A list of some good resource areas for teachers and
kids in K-12 was published.  Although these sites are not specifically
Amiga related, I thought that you might be interested in them.  If anyone
has knowledge of an educational site which is specific to the Amiga, please
let me know.  I would like to start compiling a list of these and even add
them to the OWL web site.

Putting Pages on the World-Wide-Web  by @{"Ralph Vinciguerra" link P5}


What significance does the Web have?

The World-Wide-Web, or Web for short, has been gaining in popularity over
the past few years. It offers the chance for a complete paradigm shift in
the way our society exchanges information. This can include many forms of
information including texts, music, video material, and even software. The
Web is generally considered to include the "Internet," since most Web
browsers make many internet protocols directly accessible.

The challenge with any shift in paradigm is to first learn what the change
means, and then to try to respond to the change in a manner that benefits
us all. For most people now connected to the Web in some form, this means
we can now access information nearly instantly from any other person or
organization that takes the initiative to publish. This is a radical change
from the conventional publishing model, which requires the publisher to
expend significant resources in their efforts to make materials available.
We now can use a demand driven solution when consumers can locate and
obtain information with simply a web connection and the content is
distributed on demand electronically.



What special significance does the Web have for Amigans?

The Amiga has come from a brave past, though an uncertain present, headed
for a bright future. One of the key elements which has helped keep the
Amiga spirit alive was its presence on the Web. The combination of Web
sites, file archives, discussion groups, and chat channels, has helped to
bind the worldwide community of Amiga users into a large virtual user
group. Without the Web, we would have been destined to exist as small
pockets of activity in separated geographic regions.

For Amigans, it is crucial that it becomes easy to locate and procure Amiga
materials using the Web, rather than depending on specific physical
establishments or publications. Each Web-connected Amigan can connect to
any of these key Amiga Web sites and locate recent news, freeware,
shareware, or commercial products with ease. No single conventional
publication can achieve this broad set of goals single handedly. The Web
makes this possible.

For companies like Opportunity With Learning (O.W.L.), the continuing
delays in the publishing of AC's Guide, for example, have had a detrimental
effect on sales and visibility to users. Users need lists of products
desperately to locate software to solve their needs. They also need the
confidence that comes from perceiving a strong and reliable community of
users and developers. Fortunately, the Web can provide this function
effectively. This is why O.W.L. has joined the ranks and created Web pages.

Thanks to the spectacular efforts of people behind the key Amiga Web pages,
we Amigans can now navigate to on-line resources like never before. Some of
my favorites:

        Amiga Technologies - http://www.amiga.de/

        The Amiga Home Page - http://www.omnipresence.com/Amiga/

        The Amiga Web Directory - http://www.cucug.org/amiga.html

        amiCrawler - http://www.melizo.com/area52/amicrawler/search.cgi



How does one compose Web pages?

Web pages are written as text files with special embedded tags. These tags
are based on a format called SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). A
special set of them, called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) are
interpreted and rendered by Web browsers. Complete documentation of the
tags are available on the Web at these places:

A Beginner's Guide to HTML -

        http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html

Bare Bones Guide to HTML -

        http://werbach.com/barebones/

The basic format is simple. Each tag is surrounded by angle brackets, and
contains some unique identifier. Ending tags have a "/" character prepended
to the tag name. For example, each paragraph is defined begun by a <P> tag
and ended by a </P> tag. Another important concept is hierarchical
organization of the tags. For example, the <BODY> and </BODY> tags contain
the entire body of the page. Below is a very short HTML file which has the
official surrounding HTML tags, a header with a title, and a body with a
level 1 heading and a paragraph:

        <HTML>

        <HEAD>

        <TITLE>My First Home Page</TITLE>

        </HEAD>

        <BODY>

        <H1>My First Home Page</H1>

        <P>Here is my first paragraph.</P>

        </BODY>

        </HTML>

If you are like me, you love to learn by example and experimentation. The
best way to do this is to fire up a Web browser and surf to pages you like,
and use the browser to show you the "source". The tags which produced the
Web page you are viewing will be immediately available for your analysis
and use. You can add kinks to other pages, embedded graphics files, sounds,
and more.

Once you understand the basics of creating HTML files, you'll need to
create an entry (or "home") page which is first seen by people navigating
to your site. This page is generally a launch point, or table of contents,
to the other pages you are offering. Keep it short, since people will
navigate through it regularly. If it has images embedded, keep them small
so that people won't have to wait to download a large image file each time.
Use the <ADDRESS> and </ADDRESS> tags at the bottom to provide your name
and e-mail address.

Use a Web browser to load and view your locally created pages to test them
and check the formatting. Many tools exist to help you compose these HTML
pages easily. I use an editor called EMACS which was ported to the Amiga
along with it's "HTML-mode" extensions. Another option is an Amiga specific
tool called "HTML-Heaven" which offers a Amiga-style interface to create
HTML documents. Also of note is a program called ag2html which can accept
Amiga Guide format documents and create HTML files from them. This is only
recommended if you already have Amiga Guide content to publish.



How does one publish Web pages?

Once you have your HTML pages created you need to have them placed onto a
computer which is directly connected to the internet (24 hours/day) . Many
people get their internet access through an Internet Service Provider, or
ISP. In many cases, the ISP will provide some disk space on one of their
computers where you can place HTML pages. If you are selecting an ISP,
insure that they offer this service along with your account.

O.W.L. is currently using Prodigy as an ISP. We aren't very happy with them
however for several reasons: they cannot be accessed with Amigas, their
HTML uploading tools do not support the organization of files into
directories, the files must be named according to MS-DOS 8.3 conventions,
their Web gateway is sometimes slow, forcing your readers to often wait for
pages. O.W.L. will be switching to a more conventional ISP in the near
future. O.W.L.s Web pages are accessible at this address:

        http://pages.prodigy.com/ralph/owl.htm



How will people find your Web pages?

With the phenomenal growth of the Web, one might that locating Web pages
would become a daunting task, instead it has become easy. Better ways to
locate sites were born of necessity. For example, to locate sites with no
knowledge other than a name or a couple related words one can consult a
popular Web search engine. These accept simple queries execute them against
huge indices collected from the Web at large. A couple of good engines are
at these locations:

        Yahoo - http://www.yahoo.com/

        AltaVista - http://www.altavista.digital.com/

In the case of the Amiga, a dedicated search engine called amiCrawler
(mentioned above) can locate sites related to the Amiga. As a publisher of
Amiga related pages, you need to inform the maintainers of the key Amiga
sites of your presence and they will happily add links to your pages making
it possible to locate your resources quickly and easily. O.W.L. sent e-mail
notification to the key Amiga sites listed above and we were accessible
within days on all sites except for the Amiga Technologies Web page. It is
a disappointment that their list of commercial sites is not kept up to
date, but we'll presume they are still mobilizing the needed resources to
make their Web site the best place to refer for key Amiga information.



The Future

The Web offers potential we are just beginning to realize. If you have any
Amiga information and feel the urge to share it, get on-line, and publish
your pages. The what's new list at the Amiga Web Directory is a testament
to the amount of new Amiga material going on-line every day.

The future poses even more exciting possibilities. In the next issue of the
AEL newletter, we'll have an article on the the JAVA language and how it
can transform the Web and we feel have an impact on computer-based
education. Although the port to the Amiga is still not complete, it
promises a lightweight, robust programming environment where compiled
programs can be run on any computer which supports the special JAVA virtual
machine, a secure and specially designed interpreter for compiled JAVA
bytecodes. To read up, head for these locations:

@node P7 "Getting on the Amiga Educator's List"
@toc "menu"

To get on the Amiga Educator's List send e-mail to
owl@davinci.reading.ma.us. Please specify whether you will be reading the
newsletter on Aminet or whether you would prefer to have it emailed to you.
The version on Aminet (found in the directory /docs/mags) runs with
AmigaGuide or Multiview which provides a spiffy hypertext presentation.
When requesting additions to the email list, please specify the uuencoded
or text version.  When no specification is made, we will assume that you
want the uuencoded lha file, which will allow you to view the hypertext
version.  This will be the last issue of the AEL which will be mailed via
US mail due to duplication and mailing costs. If you are still interested
in receiving the newsletter via US mail, please let me know.  If there are
not too many of you, I may consider shipping a small number of floppy disk
copies.
