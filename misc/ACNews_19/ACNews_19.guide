                            AMICOMSYS 1.31 RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Hakan Parting <hakan@parting.nu>

Hello,

AmiComSys 1.31 is released today.

Recent changes: 1.31 (01.02.2000)

   * NEW:
      - Fixed the PChat picture so whole the picture is visible if it has a size
        of 400x400 or less. Pictures bigger than 200x210 get scrollers. High
        quality dither is used (AmigaOS 3.5). Status text show "loading picture
        ..." while loading and decoding the picture.
      - The message requesters take the real font size in account when
        calculating the window size.
      - Changed the layout of the new message window.
      - Added "don't show any" to the "Put picture" cycle button in the
        Windows->Chat-settings. Select it to disable pictures in the PChat.
      - The PChat picture is now put on the top right if it's set to to be put
        to the right in the settings.

   * BUGFIX:
      - In low memory situations when AmiComSys failed to open the main window
        it tried to change the toolbar layout. Removed it because it is of no
        use anymore when the toolbars is inside scrollers.
      - The Show/Toolbars did not hide/show the toolbars under AmigaOS 3.5.
      - Very rare the error message "Connection broken by sender" could show up
        at the end of a SendFile session.
      - Sometimes it was not possible to click the "Download"-picture button in
        the PChat. At least on AmigaOS3.5 systems.
      - Packed with a Y2K fixed LHA/LZX.
      - The download of pictures in the PChat did not work on fast Amigas, like
        68060 or so.
      - There was a problem with the CPS-counter in the SendFile on 68060
        machines. Had to change presentation to bytes/s instead of kbytes/s.

   * Availability:
      - It may be downloaded at http://www.parting.nu/ACS/ and
        http://surf.to/AmiComSys/.
      - It will also be available on Aminet in comm/net/AmiComSys.lha in a few
        days.

                        PAYBACK STATUS REPORT: PART VIII
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23 February 2000 - The Latest News

Now that the game engine in 90% complete, I've started to turn my attention to
designing the levels, which means I haven't got as many new features to report
as usual. Anyway, here's what's been added to the game this month:

   * Vehicles now leave behind skidmarks when you slide them - check out the
     latest screenshots at http://www.apex-designs.net/payback_screens.html to
     see what I mean.
   * A system has been implemented which allows certain events to trigger
     others. For example, it's now possible for the game to impose a time limit
     on how long a certain mission should take.
   * The textures used before were really just placeholders - I've started to
     introduce more professional versions, as can be seen in the new
     screenshots at http://www.apex-designs.net/payback_screens.html.
   * If you start to kill people then the police will respond by shooting you on
     sight. They'll also put up roadblocks and try to run you over.
   * Lots of new sound effects have been added to the game - buses beep as they
     reverse, people scream when you run them over, crowds cheer when you
     complete a mission and grenades make a 'clink' noise when they bounce -
     which can be very helpful if you're not the one who threw the grenade!

Well, that's it for this update - look forward to seeing you next time!

                             ALIVE: QUAKE PPC NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALIVE MEDIASOFT LTD. 1st February 2000.

Since Xmas, we have been announcing details of the imminent release of Quake
PPC. To keep you updated, I'm please to say that the work is progressing very
well. We will soon be able to start bundling Amiga Quake with this new version.

So what can you expect to be included with Quake PPC?...

   * Quake 68k
   * Quake PPC
   * GL Quake (support for 3d gfx card owners)
   * Quake World (internet play)
   * PSX joypad support
   * and much much more.....

Actually Quake is no in-house development, but we'll be shipping Quake together
with the Quake-Port of Frank Wille, Steffen Haeuser and Massimiliano Tretene who
agreed with us that we can bundle Quake with their port.

They tell us that everything is going very well, and we can hope to be playing
Quake PPC very very soon!

Full updates will follow as the guys progress.....

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In other news, Alive are still on the lookout for Amiga programmers to join the
expanding team.

Anyone interested should contact jenniealive@innotts.co.uk

Also we will be putting a press release out soon about the new changes at The
Pulse. Below are some new features:

   * New Staff Writers
   * 2,500 copies delivered to Amiga users around the globe
   * Guaranteed more pages
   * At least 5 game reviews every issue - guaranteed
   * NOW released on a monthly basis
   * Adverts
   * And soon some colour....

The Fastest growing Amiga Source around

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are still in search of Amiga programers to join our team. Some of the people
who wrote to Jennie have been lost in a computer problem so if you sent her an
email about the positions, please re-send.

We especialy need another programmer to join the Alive team on the Elite III
conversion, as well as some minor work on Phantasmagoria.

Oh, Descent 2 to is not too far away now - just beta testing being done now. We
are also going to convert Marathon 2 to the Amiga. More news on that soon. If
anyone knows of any source codes floating around for good games - legal ones
only please! - then contact Alive and we'll see about bringing it to the Amiga.

                          CLICKBOOM S-FILES: PART III
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had to report this to you guys - I saw the first alpha version of Nightlong
Amiga!

Wow, this is going to be one cool game. It plays really great, and the graphics
is awesome. Joshua is such a cool character. I was amazed at the amount of
things he can do and the overall atmosphere of the game. The full screen movie
scenes are just brilliant.

At the moment the whole game works, but it's not finished yet. There are still
some things to be fixed and optimized. For example, Nightlong is so big that
it's proving very hard to squeeze it all even on 3 CDs !

Once all of the final things are fixed it will be time for beta testing. That's
where we'll need you. If you want to be a beta tester, let us know. However,
please note that only users who preordered Nightlong are eligible for beta
testing.

All in all, Nightlong is coming along nicely, and although we will be a bit late
with its release, I am sure you won't mind waiting just a bit for the biggest
Amiga game.

Best regards,
Sofia

@node eriol "ERIOL USB STATUS: 5TH FEBRUARY 2000"
                      ERIOL USB STATUS: 5TH FEBRUARY 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The design of the Eriol control logic has progressed steadily during january.
Entering february the first fullscale test simulation of the control logic is
about to begin. Following this a shorter period for correcting any logic errors
must be expected. After having verified the logical correctness of the control
logic it will be time for a fullscale timing simulation of the logic. Hopefully
this will prove what I already believe - that the timing of the control logic
will hold.

However, the Eriol project has also run into some trouble, which may delay the
project. The entire Eriol control logic is to be put into an FPGA logic chip.
The size of the logic asks for an FPGA of some logical capacity. Unfortunately
the development system that I have access to cannot cope with such big FPGA
designs, as it is not a full development system, but rather a smaller (and
cheaper) version. Three solutions exist and are under evaluation. The first is
to get hold of a full development system. This will most likely be very
expensive and I don't think I can convince the University that it has to pay up
(unfortunately). The second solution is to break the design into two separate
and smaller FPGA chips. This will give access to enough logic space to allow an
implementation. However, it will give more delay in the hardware as signals has
to pass in and out of the FPGAs, and be a lot more expensive due to the extra
FPGA. The third solution is to find another logic device for which the
University has a development system which can handle the big design.

Currently the solution being worked on is the second. I'm now working on
logically splitting the logic into two FPGAs. Together with this a redesign of
parts of the logic will take place as to minimize the number of signals having
to go from one chip to the other. Unfortunately this use of two FPGAs will put
just about an extra £20 on the production price :( The final product price is s
ill undefined...

The first prototype board, first expected at the end of february, will without
doubt be delayed from the afore mentioned problems. When the first prototype
board will exist is now an open question, but the delay should be no more than a
month.

Yours sincerely

Thomas Graff Thøger,

                IREC FOR AMIGAOS, LIVE STREAMING AUDIO RECEIVER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AudioLabs (http://www.audiolabs.it) announces iRec (internet Recording), live
streaming MPEG capabilities for AmigaOS! This cool feature comes embedded in any
new ProStationAudio version, starting with the forthcoming Millennium edition.

iRec is fully functional (monitoring and direct-to-disk recording) in the new
ProStationAudio demo to be available for downloading the first week of March
2000. Every AmigaOS user is encouraged to take advantage of this new free tool.

Thanks to iRec, the ProStationAudio mixing console input (RecBus) can be
switched between a local audio board or a remote audio server, accessible via
Internet or a LAN.

Once connected (Miami or compatible TCP stack required), iRec lets you record
live MPEG streams. During the streaming process, ProStationAudio allows you to
monitor the incoming signal and record direct-to-disk, with on-the-fly
conversion from MPEG to PCM.

iRec is compatible with a large number of web-stations broadcasting in MPEG,
including ShoutCast (TM) audio servers.

Millennium saves your preferred iRec URL's into an external text file so that
you can easily edit/process your database or share it with other ProStationAudio
users.

The ProStationAudio editing application requires a 68040/16MB system to start
with, and is optimized for hi-end configurations including up to two video
cards, two monitors and two CPUs.

For more information about ProStationAudio please refer to the official sites:

   * http://www.audiolabs.it (European server)
   * http://usa.audiolabs.it (US mirror)
   * http://www.emrl.com/prostationaudio/ (US distributor)

                                  MET@BOX NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The german magazine "amigaOS" has published in its latest issue an interview
with Thomas Rudloff (met@box). Martin Heine (of amiga-news.de fame) has posted
some of the answers in c.s.a.misc and here you have them.

   * In addition to the flyer I quoted January 31st, a further difference of the
     amijoe for A2k and A3/4k from the amijoe1200 is that those for 2/3/4k will
     have a 100MHz-frontsidebus.
   * the 3/4k-boards will be available about one month after the aj1200, the
     2k-version will take about three weeks longer.
   * the price for the "k"-boards will be about 100 DM more than the same
     version of the aj1200 because of the bigger board and the more expensive
     technology.
   * asked why they use a G3 instead of G4, Rudloff answered: "We can offer
     today 500MHz-G3-boards, while the situation of supply of the G4 is still
     not clear. All I can say about this for reasons of NDA is, that the first
     quarter of this year will bring completely new perspectives."
   * Regarding 68k-emulation: met@box has two emulations in development,
     optimized for the pipes of the G3/G4. The first one is in a Flash-ROM and
     will reach about the niveau of a 030 - 040. An update for this emulation
     will only be necessary in case of any bugs. The second emulation will be
     loaded from harddisk at booting and brings the full speed. For this one
     there'll be regular updates for improvement. Current calculations show,
     that a PPC needs about 3.5 cycles (? - german: "Takt") for the emulation
     of one 8/16-bit-68k-command; 32-bit-commands are emulated in ca. 1.5
     cycles, so that, regarding Thomas Rudloff, already their entrance-model
     will be better than an overclocked 68060. Important would be the
     possibility to switch between 68k- and PPC-code, so that a partial port of
     AmigaOS and applications would be possible. The second generation of
     emulation is already planned and will be much faster.

                             MORPHOS PROJECT STATUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry to say it but the MorphOS devpackage won't make it this month.

The main reason for the delay is that Frank Mariak's CyberstormPPC died end of
1999 and only after the 2nd send/resend procedure Phase5 found out that it's
unrepairable broken.(Pads for the ppc ballgrid array seem to be burned/glued) He
got a new PPC board today from me so he can continue working on native cybergfx
since today....but that was a loss of 1 month on his side.

And as Frank and I agreed on not releasing anything until cybergfx is completely
native we have this delay.

Another issue is that the ppc.library and full elf integration isn't completed
yet which we need to able to create amiga library replacements in elf format.
But all that is only a matter of this week.

Writing docs and example code for the new execppc additions is also not
complete... code for a device and library frame work is needed for the dev
package.

Now to the positive things....

The emulation itself got a lot more usable the last month after fixing a nasty
problem in the execppc scheduler which caused some deadlock glitches.

We found out the reason for some mysterious vector imageclass problem related to
the blitter.

The symbios 770 cybppc.device is now 100% native which showed that porting
existing lowlevel amiga devices is possible and doesn't even require that much
effort if you know how to do it. All that will help for finishing the native
cybergfx.

A lot internal structure changes which took real time....

I managed to compile an amiga gcc 2.95.2 for the dev package...so at least the
compiler thing is no issue anymore.

         OPEN AMIGA FOUNDATION AND AROS ANNOUNCE STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRESS RELEASE
16 FEBRUARY 2000

Media Contact:  Steve Crietzman
President and CEO
Open Amiga Foundation
Tel: +44 (0)1778 393323

16 February 2000 -- The Open Amiga Foundation and AROS are to enter into a
strategic relationship which they believe will be of great benefit to their
organisations, their members and the wider Amiga community. In the words of Open
Amiga president Steve Crietzman, "our objectives are compatible, it makes sense
for us to work together."

Under the terms of the deal, the Open Amiga Foundation (formerly known as Open
Amiga/COSA), will become the organisation responsible for public relations,
marketing, business and legal affairs of the open-source AmigaOS project.

The Open Amiga Foundation, led by Steve Crietzman, will also oversee the
creation and development of Standards Bodies, Working Groups and Development
Teams to focus on the development of modern standards, and the production of
high-quality Amiga software and applications for an open-source Amiga OS.

The Open Amiga Foundation will also handle general promotion of open standards,
open platforms and open-source software within the Amiga world.

It is our intention to fill the vacuum left by the disappearance of Commodore's
CATS and Developer Support programme, and the lack of decent high-quality
application software.

The Amiga Research OS project, led by Aaron Digulla, will handle the actual
development of the Amiga Operating System core. As part of this, OAF have agreed
to encourage all our developers to register with the AROS project, and to
delegate Amiga OS core development to AROS. AROS will continue to operate
independently from Open Amiga, but our relationship nonetheless acts, as Aaron
Digulla put it, "like a symbiosis."

The Amiga Research OS (AKA "AROS") project will, in a sense, become the Amiga
Operating System development wing of the Open Amiga Foundation, and will focus
it's efforts on development of AmigaOS/ AROS, should the Amiga operating system
be released as open source, as we hope it will be (and are working extremely
hard to achieve).

Open Amiga will complement this by handling the legal and business affairs of
the project, which Aaron Digulla said was "a big relief for us here at AROS."

We believe an alliance between the leading open-source OS development team on
the Amiga platform (AROS), and the far-reaching resources of the Open Amiga
Foundation are a match made in heaven, and with our combined resources, we have
the resources and the skills to achieve great things together.

It is our mutual goal to chart a future for the Amiga operating system that is
ambitious, radical and far-reaching, and gives the AmigaOS a chance of real
survival and growth, as an independent OS preserving its own unique identity.

And by listening to the Amiga community on the Internet and at trade shows, we
have seen that this what many in the community WANT. They WANT AmigaOS, not some
hybrid, alternative or "inspired by the Amiga concept" OS. They want AmigaOS,
and they want it to survive, and perhaps more importantly, to grow. Pure and
simple.

Our strategy is to give the community what they want, to address all of these
concerns, and deliver improved, portable and free versions of the AmigaOS for a
variety of next-generation CPUs and platforms.

People will be able to choose to run AmigaOS on top of another kernel if that is
their wish (in order to benefit from Linux driver support and such like), but
they will not be forced to do so. AmigaOS will be able to function
independently. We believe this is what a great many people in the community
wants.

Questions and queries regarding the future of AmigaOS as "open source software"
should be directed to Open Amiga, which is acting in the capacity of an overall
parent/public relations organisation.

Developers wishing to participate, either in the development of the OS core
itself, or in working as part of a development team to create software or
applications for the Amiga, should apply through Open Amiga Foundation, and you
will be put in touch with the appropriate people managing the projects you are
interested in.

Current Working Groups include AROS, led by Aaron Digulla, and our Streaming
Media Working Group, led by Ian Parker. Other Working Groups, Standards Bodies
and Development Teams will be created in due course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions and Answers

QUESTION: Is this a merger between AROS and Open Amiga?

ANSWER: No. Both groups will continue to operate independently, neither will
have operational control over the other. We are merely pooling our resources,
and dividing up roles between us.

QUESTION: How will this co-operation function in practice?

ANSWER: Both groups will work very closely together, and we will have very
clearly defined roles. We are working on the same strategy, but we share the
various roles, and we are better at different things. (With regards to AmigaOS:
AROS is the development project, OAF is the business/organisation.)

QUESTION: What is the likelihood that the AmigaOS will be released as open
source?

ANSWER: At this time, it is not possible to give a straight answer to this
question. We are pursueing all avenues open to us to make it happen.

QUESTION: I thought Gateway still owned the Amiga patents?

ANSWER: They do, and we are in negotiation with Gateway already on this matter.
We are hopeful that a positive arrangement can be reached within the next few
weeks.

QUESTION: Does Amiga Corporation support what you are doing?

ANSWER: We have their unofficial backing. It is not possible for legal reasons
for them to commit to open-source, since many legal hurdles prevent them from
doing this, most notably the issue of Gateway's patents.

However, Fleecy Moss and Petro Tyschtschenko of Amiga have both publicly stated
their support for an open-source AmigaOS in public interviews and forums.

QUESTION: If the AmigaOS is not released as open source, what happens to AROS
and Open Amiga?

ANSWER: We will continue. The source code is not a necessity for us, but it
would be a help.

The main issue for us is access to software patents and various Amiga
trademarks. Providing an adequate deal is reached with Gateway for access to
patents, and a deal reached with Amiga for access to Amiga trademarks, we can
safely and legally develop a portable clone of Amiga OS.

The source code is unnecessary, but will help us develop a portable clone of
AmigaOS for other CPUs and platforms in a shorter space of time.

QUESTION: Are you for or against what Amiga are doing re: Tao?

ANSWER: OAF/AROS does not take a position on other Amiga-related projects
including Amiga/Tao or Phoenix/QNX. We support the right of Amiga users to make
their own reasoned judgements and to choose the solution that is bested suited
for them.

We believe it is in the interests of the Amiga community to be given maximum
choice on the path they take, and in that sense, we support Amiga's creation of
a new alternative option.

QUESTION: I am a developer. I would like to help. What can I do?

ANSWER: Write to president@amigakernel.org and we will let you know what groups
are looking for more developers, and you will be invited to join one of our
active development teams.

Also bookmark http://www.openamiga.org. Our new, improved website will be going
online within the next few weeks.

                          AMIGAOS 3.5 HIDDEN MESSAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two days ago Harry Sintonen (piru@innocent.com) happened to browse to Workbench
Nostalgia web page (http://www.gregdonner.org/) just to find out that seemingly
no one has yet found the AmigaOS 3.5 hidden message.

Olaf Barthel has confirmed there is one so he did some studies and found it. :)

All the following is in at least BoingBag1 updated AmigaOS 3.5.

   * "Do You Know The Way To San José" - message inside the
     libs:workbench.library. There is a relocation entry pointing to this
     string inside the library, but it doesn't seem to be used by anything. Not
     100% sure about this though. (Note: This is a song which has been sung by
     several people. The version I like the most was done by the 80's band
     "Frankie Goes To Hollywood". Another interpretation is a reference to the
     Amiga facilities, in Jim Collas times, which were in San José,
     California).

   * Little german rot13 crypted message at the end of the
     libs:workbench.library (CygnusEd has rot13 feature, AmigaOS 3.5 and
     CygnusEd have been greatly influenced by Olaf Barthel :-)

     The message encrypted is:

     Denn die einen sind im Dunkeln
     Und die andern sind im Licht.
     Und man siehet die im Lichte
     Die im Dunkeln sieht man nicht.

     In english:

     Some are in the dark
     some are in the light.
     The ones in the light are seen
     the ones in the dark you can not see.
     (rough translation by ZZA)

     <ignatios> says it's from the "Dreigroschenoper", text: B. Brecht, music:
     K. Weill. There's a translation to English sung by Louis Armstrong, in
     case you have access to a disk library...

   * Cool eastern egg in Workbench About:
     1. Choose Workbench/About... menu item.
     2. Position the about window so that both left and top are odd. (for
        example to position x:1 y:1, you can turn off the mouse acceleration to
        make positioning easier)
     3. Type "Who?" when the window is active (excluding "")
     4. Click Ok.
     5. Check RAM: for something cool :-)

   * Dafel: Bloodline

     A few set backs before Christmas threw Pagan Games off their scheudle so
     they are a little late in brining this classy retro style RPG to you. To
     help their progress they have hired another in-game level designer. Their
     engine has been ported to C for extra speed and portabilty while they wait
     on level design to be completed.

     More info about Dafel: Bloodline at
     http://www.pagan-games.com/amiga/Bloodline/Default.htm

   * Magick

     Their real-time strategic game is progressing nicely. With the additon of
     their new coder, Henrik Munther, a.k.a., Psycho from scene demo coders
     Loonies, their realisation for a high class real-time 3D engine is fast
     becoming a reality! Magick will bring to the Amiga a type of game yet
     unheard off with full 3D rendering bringing a deep view aspect to the game
     play. Their initial alpha engine already allows a player to walk across a
     3D landscape, interact with the encrionment and switch camera views from
     one player unit to another. Expect a high quality game on a high spec
     machine, 060 and gfx is a minimum spec with PPC and 3D Chip support
     planned.

     More info about Magick at
     http://www.pagan-games.com/amiga/Magick/Default.htm

   * Scavengers

     A PPC coder for this project has been found and a demo is currnetly under
     development. Their fast paced real-time 3D shooter and RPG is going to
     blow you away with is PPC accelerated graphics and engrossing story line!
     As with Magick, the target specifications is for PPC users with any gfx
     card to fully appreciate the speed and playabiloty of this game.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Snoqualmie Ridge Business Park

Activity at the business park gains momentum with the addition of another
high-tech tenant

BELLEVUE, Wash. - February 29, 2000 - Growth continues at Snoqualmie Ridge
Business Park with the arrival of the newest high-tech tenant, Amiga, Inc. The
Quadrant Corporation, developer of the business park, announced that Amiga will
move its world headquarters to Snoqualmie Ridge on March 1.

Amiga created and developed the world's first multi-media computer system in the
early 1980s. It continues the development, design and implementation of
components, services, and models that support the digital experience of the
future. Amiga's products are used by companies such as Walt Disney Co., Warner
Bros. and NASA.

The company will occupy 10,100 square feet in a building owned by The Inception
Group. Eventually, Amiga will house 70 employees at its headquarters.

"Snoqualmie Ridge Business Park offers value and unique benefits for Amiga,"
said Bill McEwen, president of Amiga. "Not only does it provide great
flexibility for growth, but it also offers open and serene surroundings for our
employees."

"Not many locations provide an environment where you can write code while
looking out the window at wildlife and a great view of Mt. Si," added McEwen.

Located less than 20 minutes from downtown Bellevue on I-90, Snoqualmie Ridge
Business Park is the largest available business park in East King County. Amiga
joins other high tech companies such as Optiva, manufacturer of the Sonicare
Toothbrush, and The Inception Group. The business park's Cascade View office
building currently has 28,650 square feet of available space.

Brokers for the deal were Dave Miller of Raskin & Associates for The Inception
Group and Steve Oswald and Ann Bishop of Wallace Properties representing Amiga.

Quadrant's Commercial Division has developed more than five million square feet
of commercial space in more than 80 building projects in the Puget Sound
metropolitan area. Visit Quadrant's Web site at http://www.quadrantcorp.com/.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   * Phase5 G4 Situation

As many of you will have heard by now, all indications are that Phase5 has gone
into receivership. This puts their delivery of the their G4 products into very
serious doubt. Many of you will know of another company called Metabox that has
been developing their AmiJoe G3 accelerators. It is rumoured that most of
Phase5's engineers have been hired by Metabox for the AmiJoe project. It is also
rumoured that Phase5 sold any remaining product rights to DCE. So, all hope is
not lost and we expecting a G3 or G4 accelerator line to be coming from Metabox.

   * Inventory Clearance

We have been gone through our inventory stock and identified excess and older
items that we would like to move. There is everything in this list from complete
systems (A3000T Graphics station, A4000T Toaster Flyer) to A1200 parts to misc.
hardware and software. Check out the list at
http://www.randomize.com/amigaproducts/inventory.html.

   * Our Take on the General Amiga Situation

We have been in touch with Amiga Corporation and believe that the new Amiga
owners headed by Bill McQuen and Fleecy Moss will be successful in bring a new
Amiga platform as well as helping the classic line. Please note that our
Inventory Clearance does not mean that we are leaving the Amiga market. On the
contrary, we will continue to supply Amiga expansion products and Amiga based
systems and will continue to work towards making these system more readily
available and cheaper. You may notice that we are diversifying our company
taking advantage of new development, especially relating to DVD. You can check

@node twf "THE WORLD FOUNDRY: MARCH 2000 UPDATE"
                      THE WORLD FOUNDRY: MARCH 2000 UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Ed Collins <collins-e@dnet.co.uk>

  1. TWF Opinion Polls

     The poll we have been running for over a month now has now finished. We
     asked the question:

     With the recent buyout of the Amiga by Amino just before the new year, do
     you think this will reverse the amigas fortunes ?

     The final votes are:
      - Yes - 142
      - No - 19
      - Don't Know - 26

     A new poll has been added with the following question:

     With quite a number of ports of popular PC games currently being ported to
     the Amiga platform, what would be your prefered option for TWF to do ?

     Just two choices this time, Game Ports or Originals.

  2. Explorer 2260 Update

     News this month:
      - A lovely picture of the shipyard that appears in the game was added to
        the E2260 section of the TWF website early this month.
      - Finialised jump engine configurations and space/weight requirements.
        Reworked some of the theoretical hyperspatial physics to allow for
        multidimensional effects.
      - Redesigned several ship system areas to use realtime 3D generated
        visuals instead of pre rendered scenes.
      - Added 2D animation facilities to the graphics abstraction layer
      - Investigation of PowerPlay communications protocol started.

  3. Maim & Mangle Update.

     News this month:
      - Work is progressing on porting the game engine to using miniGL developed
        by Hyperion.
      - Work is also being on adding the path finding to the game. Both these
        parts are due for mid March.
      - All the Terran units have been modeled.

     And nathan has this to say.
      - Getting myself up to speed on the M&M documentation.
      - Learning the layout of the engine source and where my code is going to
        go.
      - Putting the engine source through various compilers. This is a benefit
        to me as I use several compilers, and for the future linux port.
      - Digging though my stacks of magazines (game developer etc.) and books
        for anything useful. I've done a fair amount of reading this month.
      - Playing games (not that much!) for ideas and inspiration.

  4. Next News Update

   REGARDING QUESTIONS TO VILLAGE TRONIC PRODUCTS FOR AMIGA - A SHORT REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are questions and rumors - first: Village Tronic is alive!

But we did not found the excellent hard- and software developers we were looking
for in 1999. That means we had to concentrate the workforce we have on the top
priority projects. Unfortunately, the ParaGlide is not a top priority.

The good news is that despite of these concentrations the ParaGlide project
still has not been canceled, because the developers coming from the Amiga did
reject to cancel it.

We are looking for a ParaGlide fan who is an experienced PCB layouter and uses
the Protel layout system. The schematic is ready in Protel, and the positions of
the connectors are fixed on the PCB. But the PCB has to be layouted, that means
8 EDO-DRAM 40pin, 1 PQFP240, 1 PQFP208, 1 QFP100 and some small stuff. If you
are interested in helping the ParaGlide project, send email to.our Amiga support
at .

The software side is organized already.

                              WORLD OF AMIGA 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again, the UK will be the centre of Amiga attention this summer. While we
are awaiting confirmation of the exact dates, we can confirm that the show will
be happening in late June/early July.

This should give overseas visitors ample time to pop across the pond to visit
the fabulous AmiWest show on 29th & 30th July as well!

Why are we going for a summer slot ? Quite simply because Amiga have asked us to
book those dates. You can be sure that they have something exceptional to show
this time round... but you'll just have to trust us because we're keeping extra
quiet until then! As always, the show is taking place with Amiga's full support,
and is being organised with the assistance of UK user groups, magazines, and
Infinite Frontiers.

In order to make the show a far more central occasion, it is likely that we will
move the event to Birmingham. This will make the travelling distance fairer for
everyone, and make it considerably easier for dealers to get to. As a
side-effect, we're confident that we'll be able to offer an even lower stand
hire price. Expect to see some huge stands, as well as...

   * Games competitions
   * Shareware registration
   * Seminars
   * How-to sessions
   * Helpdesk
   * Stands for user groups
   * AAA Awards

The official World Of Amiga website will shortly be updated with details, so
make sure you visit it frequently! We will be providing on-line ticket ordering
again, and will shortly activate the system so that you can reserve your tickets
early.

Tickets will be priced at £7.50 for adults, and £5.00 for under 14s. Families of
two adults and two children (under 14) enter for only £15.00! Additionally, for
people wishing to attend on both days of the show, there will be a special booth
on Saturday that will sell tickets to existing ticket holders for Sunday's show
for a mere £2.00 (£1.00 for under 14s).

Keep an eye on the website! Further details will be posted there shortly.

                       INTERVIEW WITH THOMAS DELLERT, DCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This interview was done in german by Petra Struck and translated to english by
Martina Jacobs.

   * amiga news: Many users worry about how and if Phase5 products will still be
     available. As to our knowledge DCE allready obtained a number of licences
     from Phase5 some time ago. How about this in detail?

   * Thomas Dellert: DCE owns exclusive rights on the following Phase5 products:
     1. Blizzard 1240
     2. Blizzard 1260
     3. Blizzard 2040
     4. Blizzard 2060
     5. Blizzard SCSI IV Kit
     6. CV 64 3D
     7. CV PPC
     8. B-Vision
     9. Cyberstorm MK III
    10. Cyberstorm PPC
    11. Blizzard PPC

     Pos. 1-6 are allready available again.

     Cyberstorm MK III and PPC will be shipping within the 8th week of this
     year.

     Blizzard PPC after about 7 weeks.
     BVision and CV PPC about today fortnight.
     Distribution will be done by Vesalia Computer.

   * amiga news:These are excellent news! Will DCE take over repair services for
     those products, too?

   * Thomas Dellert: DCE will take over repair services for those products. So,
     owners of elder boards don't have to worry about that.

   * amiga news: Will the licences and the availability of Phase5 products be
     impaired or even endangered by Phase5's application for insolvency?

   * Thomas Dellert: We've obtained exclusive rights for these products in April
     1999 already. We are not paying any licence fee to P5. Rather than this we
     obtained the licences by a single payment. There are unobjectionable
     contracts. The availability of the products is secure.

   * amiga news: Will there be further software updates relating phase5
     products? Are you allready in contact about this with Ralph Schmitdt?

   * Thomas Dellert: A good an very important question, Petra. Yes, I had a
     meeting with Ralph Schmidt and Frank Mariak two days ago. We have come to
     terms that in the future we will cooperate very close. There will be a FTP
     server on oure homepage, where device updates will be found for download.

   * amiga-news.de: Are there any plans for new developments based upon Phase5's
     products?

   * Thomas Dellert: For sure existing hardware will be produced at first. There
     are a lot of preorders. Since Permedia II chips have been announced by TI,
     we probable will be able to produce only a number of 1200 BVision or
     CV-PPC boards. Hence we are thinking about a Permedia III board for Amiga.
     This might be mounted upon the existing BVision or CV-PPC platform. Frank
     Mariak will develope the software for us. With the entire amount of
     technical know-how of Phase5 we now have a powerful package at our
     disposal. In any case there will be activities relating PPC. For the time
     being as a dual CPU resolution only.

   * amiga-news.de: In particular: Will there be a Phase5 G4 board from DCE, and
     will there be pay regard to prepayments Phase5 allready recieved relating
     those boards? Or will there be hardware at cheaper prices, similar to
     Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe offering to all those Euromail harmed people
     AminetCDs at a price of DM 5 or bricks?

   * Thomas Dellert: Relating that I allready met with Wolf Dietrich. Indeed at
     this time I cannot tell, if we will decide for a G4 project.

   * amiga-news.de: Do DCE have access to hardware of Phase5' customers, which
     lies at Phase5's for repair at this time?

   * Thomas Dellert: No, we haven't.

   * amiga-news.de: Thomas, thank you very much for your informativ answers. We
     are pacifyed and pleased that production will continue, and that customers
     who have Phase5 products will be able to take up a competent service for
     repair at DCE.

            INTENT(TM) FONT SYSTEM FOR TAO'S DIGITAL CONTENT HEAVEN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More best of breed technology for networked digital appliances exclusive to the
intent(TM) brand

Reading, England, February 17th 2000.

The Tao Group has today provided further proof of its continuing drive and
success in making its intent(TM) digital content engine and toolkit the very
best the industry can offer in terms of quality, footprint, performance,
flexibility, and portability. This has come in the form of the announcement of
Tao's intent Font System. intent is Tao's binary portable applications layer for
networked digital appliances, combining the most advanced technologies for an
integrated Java(TM) language, C and portable assembler environment. intent also
consolidates audio with both 2D and 3D graphics in one complete package. It is
available across most market leading operating systems and almost the complete
range of major processor families for consumer products.

Tao had already revealed details of its own 2D drawing, windowing, compositing
and gadget libraries, the integration of Criterion's RenderWare® 3D solution and
the SSEYO(TM) Koan(TM) audio engine as part of the intent digital content
platform. As reported last month, Francis Charig, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Tao told analysts, "intent is so named because we are putting
together the leading multimedia technologies for the creation of compelling
interactive content. In spite of strong demand there has been an industry vacuum
in this area, that intent is now filling."

Tao has now released the details of the intent font system, which Tao executives
believe will further position its software as the standard content foundation
for networked digital appliances.

The Font System consists of three layers: glyph caching technology, vector
rendering engine and format decoder plug-ins. It has achieved an impressive
roll-call of objectives: including having a low memory footprint, high
performance, and high readability. It is customer extendable, the system has
flexible configuration options and it is fully platform independent.

Plug-ins include TrueType®, PostScript® Type 1, Windows® Resource Fonts and ROM
Fonts with additional plug-in options to follow.

Features include 1 bit, 4 bit or 8 bit anti-aliasing, on-the-fly gamma
correction, configurable cache memory, configurable font name mapping,
Panose(TM) matching, Micro-spaced printing, co-existing plug-ins, and it has a
typical footprint of 50KB.

The font engine enables high quality rendering, with on-screen easy readability,
even on low-end consumer devices and yet can scale up to the highest quality DTP
typographical requirements.

The font system is an essential component of the development kit to be announced
shortly by Tao and its partners. Further announcements of world class tools for
the intent engine will be made shortly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every last Wednesday Fleecy Moss, Vice President of Product Development for the
new Amiga Inc., attend to a live conference in the only-for-members AmigaZone's
chat area.

The last conference, held on the evening of February 23, 2000, was a little bit
boring because there was not a lot of people asking questions to Fleecy. Anyway,
he disclosed some interesting things about the future.

First, Fleecy said that Amiga Inc. have a new office, a new VP of operations
whose name is Vince Pfeiffer, and they just did their latest round of training
in the Tao system which took place in Seattle.

Amiga have a development team (a dozen or so), a developer support manager and
team (14), the AAC has been restarted, they are trying to get the ADN (= Amiga
Dealer Network) moving again, they have a VP of operations whose name is Vince
Pfeiffer, the new website is close to being ready, and they are working on
something nice for the community.

Quite a few of the people they are hiring will be very familiar to the community
but apart from Dean K. Brown, no one from the old days. When the new website
comes up we will know more names. Fleecy had hoped the new Director of Developer
support would be up by now but it seems Bill was busy moving. By the way, the
director of developer support is someone you all know and love, but we are not
going to know his name until the press release.

There are no real news about the liquidation of the remaining A1200s. Petro is
slowly selling them into India, where there is a big demand for them. Bill is
getting a pallet NTSC'd to bring over. They are looking at another possibility
which could return some real rewards for everyone.

Bill is very concerned about the dealers. People have stopped buying as they
wait and Amiga want them to understand that they should buy the SW because they
are working with H&P to ensure it works on the new Amiga. It isn't wasted.

Fleecy, Bill and the director of developer support are trying to sort out
something for the developers - they have some legal stuff to take care of soon.
All the announcements they had thought would be nicely spread out will probably
all arrive at the same time.

If people is worried about the performance of the Tao's Virtual Processor, They
should know that Tao gives transparent multi-processor parallelism. Amiga are
also looking at some technology that could turn the internet from treacle to
better than TV whilst being fully interactive.

With respect the software, the problem with that is Amiga could end up doing a
Be and spend more time writing drivers than developing their core product. What
Amiga need is a unified driver model - HAVi will hopefully allow them to get
there.

Amiga will start at one developer conference a year, a full serious and
commercial developer thing with most of the developer leads there, for some
serious work and play. As they expand, so they will.

The Amiga Advisory Council will be developed to its full potential. It was
Bill's idea after all. Collas just got the credit for it. They are also doing
something on the new site that will try to be a focus for the community, give
them an opportunity to participate, belong etc.

H&P are going to create product for the new Amiga, work with Amiga on creating a
classic emulator, and perhaps, if they can swing it, do a set of transitional
releases that help move developer and user from the old to the new.

The eagerly awaited developer box will come out in the next few months, probably
in April. With it Amiga are taking a risk because there won't be much Amie in
it, since they are still developing it, but they can get their hands on
something.

Hello and welcome to the 19th issue of AmiChannel News.

If you are connected to the Internet, probably you already know the bad news.
Phase 5, manufacturers of the PowerUp boards and 3D Gfx cards for Amiga is now
out of business.

This is a sad news, but a clear indication of the total death of hardware
development for Amiga. Yes, some games and applications are still being
developed for Amiga, but not a real hardware product, perhaps with the exception
of the AmiJoe boards.

Phase 5 tried to revitalize the Amiga with the release of PPC boards and 3D Gfx
cards for the Amiga. They did a great job but they made two big errors.

As you probably remember, the kernel war between Phase 5 and Haage&Partner in
1997 hurted a lot to Phase 5. The big problem was that Phase 5 tried to do
everything (hardware and software) when they were only a hardware company. If
they had collaborated with H&P using the WarpUp kernel is the PowerUp boards,
they would have succeed.

The second mistake was to stop the production of PowerUp boards so they have not
a damn product in market while they were developing the G4 boards. So, they had
not an income and the final result was their bankruptcy. A shame, but life goes
on.
