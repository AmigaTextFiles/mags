Hello and welcome to the 17th issue of AmiChannel News.

If you are a regular reader of AmiChannel News (the only one! ;-D) probably you
are wondering what happened to the December issue. Well, it has been "lost" due
to a Y2K bug ;-D. Not really, I have had problems with my ISP, so I could not
upload this issue in time and, as the title of this editorial suggests,
"something happened in the way to heaven".

In case you don't know by now, Amiga has been sold... again! Gateway was only
interested in the patents and nothing else, so they were looking to sold the
other parts they did not wanted. And the new owner of the Amiga is... AMINO.

Again, in case you don't know, Amino is the company that Fleecy Moss and Bill
McEwen founded back in September when the second was fired by Amiga, some days
before the Amiga fiasco. For more information about Amino, you can read
@{"this article" Link not43}.

But, what about the future?. Well probably you want to read
@{"this letter" Link not42} from Bill who explained it all. Well, almost all,
because a more detailed press released is expect very soon. Although it is not
oficial, the Amino's plan is more or less the same of the designed in times of
Amiga Inc. in Collas times. The only difference is that we are going to see
another player in Amiga. QNX is not the kernel selected by Amino, neither do
Linux.

Write this name and remember where you have first read: TAO Group. The name of
the kernel: Elate. I do not have a lot of information about this kernel, but I
expect to look into this and post into the SAUG-news site. So watch regularly
for updated information about the future, who promise very interesting.

Remember to visit the SAUG website, which is located in:

	http://teleline.terra.es/personal/angelsau/index.html

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

	noticias@saug.org

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.

From James Daniels <james.daniels@apex-designs.net>

                                1 December 1999

The News

Things have been a bit busy these last few weeks, so I've not made as much
progress as I would have liked. Anyway, here's what I have been up to:

   - I've given the site a fairly radical facelift - hope you like the new look.
     Let me know what you think!
   - I've been negotiating the soundtrack; so far, 11 bands have agreed to
     appear in the game, contributing a total of 16 songs. However, only a few
     have managed to send me the signed contracts yet, so it could a couple
     more weeks until things are finalised.
   - I've been squishing bugs in the code. As usual. :-)
   - I've been looking into Locale support.
   - I've started to add some more advanced scripting features to allow the
     script to put messages up on the player's screen. Now that the
     communications backbone between the script and the game engine is working
     properly things should progress a lot quicker.

Well, that's all for the time being. See you next update!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30-November-1999: Current status on Shogo Amiga/Mac port by Thomas Frieden

Client

The client took much less time than expected. After just two weeks, the client
completed its startup up to the point where it wanted to start up the client
shell, which is the part that actually contains the game itself. It seems the
client is fully operational, with just some minor quirks (for example, parts of
exploding MCA's seem to be made of rubber, they bounce a little too high).

My current occupation is to find the last remaining bugs, and to try to reduce
the memory consumption, which is now around 40 MB, depending on the level
played.

Client Shell

The client shell is the part of the program where the "real" game resides, it
contains the things like menus, user interface, and the code to initiate a game.
It was relatively easy to port to a state that allowed it to start and host a
local game. The network startup is handled by a Windows dialog, which is the
only code that is not yet ported.

Renderer

We ported the software renderer first - it was easier because of the relatively
Windows-free code. The first version was a prototype that did not do any 3d
rendering, just display handling, input and surface management. When that worked
(it was the work of one day), I ported the rest of the renderer. Despite some
very hard work to find bugs (one took me nearly a week), it worked nearly "out
of the box". The speed is acceptable, even the current version with all the
debugging code in it is as fast as an equivalent Pentium system.

The hardware renderer is currently worked on by Joe Serra, who is porting the
DirectX stuff over to our own OpenGL implementation, which is currently done by
Hans-Joerg Frieden.

                      [THE WORLD FOUNDRY] DECEMBER UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Ed Collins <collins-e@dnet.co.uk>

#1. TWF Opinion Polls#

There has only been only poll held this month which asked the question: "What is
your favourite type of game ?".

This was split into 10 different game types with the top 2 choices being RPGs
and Space Sims with the votes of 37 and 33 respectively. Well no surprise you're
all wanting a good space sim. :)

A new poll will appear soon.

#2. Explorer 2260 Update.#

Here are a few of the things that have been done for Explorer 2260 in November:

   - RedHat 6 (LinuxPPC 3Q99) has been installed and, while lots of setup work
     still needs to be finished, work on the Linux server core routines is
     continuing.
   - More background documents for the CEG are being created.

#3. Maim&Mangle Update.#

Work is continuing on M&M and here is what has happened in November on
development.

   - (temporary) removed the obj's shadow due a few bugs.
   - Optimized the 3D math routines.
   - The collision routine now working perfectly (in the sense that it recognize
     a collision situation).
   - Removed a lot of bugs.
   - The loading routines are now a little bit faster.
   - New Warp3D supporting Object Editor for 68k (PPC version coming soon).
   - Further M&M game design thrashed out.

#4. Next News Update#

31st December 1999 / 1st January 2000 (Wahey!!) Or maybe /slightly/ later in the
new year. :)

~~~~~

All the best,
Ed.

                    NORDIC GLOBAL: CHANGES FOR THE YEAR 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am happy to announce that starting January, 2000 I will work for REBOL
Technologies in the capacity of Director of Network Technologies.

For those of you who have not heard about that company before: REBOL
Technologies (www.rebol.com) is a privately held company that was founded by
Carl Sassenrath, one of the premier developers of AmigaOS. REBOL Technologies
develops and distributes the scripting language REBOL, a very intuitive
programming language and run-time environment with built-in Internet support and
messaging capabilities. REBOL is available for over 50 computer platforms,
AmigaOS being one of them. The basic version of REBOL is available for free,
extensions are available for license fees.

Declining revenues from Amiga software sales and increased software piracy in
1999 finally forced me to look for a full-time job outside of my own company.
Between several job offers I decided to accept the offer by REBOL for several
reasons. The most important one is that in my opinion REBOL is currently one of
the few truly innovative products in the software market, and with Carl
Sassenrath's history with AmigaOS his company and its product in many ways
reflect and represent the Amiga spirit.

With my background in AmigaOS and TCP/IP I am excited about the opportunity to
participate in the development of REBOL, in particular in the improvement of its
networking capabilities, the AmigaOS port and ports for possible Amiga
successors.

I am afraid this new job means that I will no longer be able to work full-time
on my own Amiga software (Miami, Daytona etc.). This does not mean that the
software becomes unsupported or that I am leaving the Amiga platform though. I
intend to still provide updates and support for existing software, as my time
permits. Here are some details about current plans for my Amiga software:

   - AmiWin: still supported. An update with 24-bit support and a newer X11R6
     kernel is still planned, but unlikely to be ready soon.
   - Daytona and related products: I am afraid Daytona and its planned
     extensions have to be cancelled. There are two reasons for this: one is
     lack of time: with my new full-time job I have to cut back somewhere, and
     doing it on a project that is still in development seems to be the most
     reasonable solution. The other reason is a possible conflict of interests,
     because Java and REBOL are competitors in the market of languages for
     distributed computing, which may make it unethical for me to remain
     involved in Java-related software. I have not yet determined what will
     happen to the Daytona sources. There are several options, somewhat
     restricted by Sun's licensing conditions, and I will try to find a
     solution that will somehow still allow the existing Java VM of Daytona to
     be released to the Amiga community, without future involvement or support
     from me though.
   - Miami: still fully supported. Version 3.3 is planned for release in the
     year 2000.
   - Miami Deluxe: fully supported. After several delays and many improvements
     the first full release including documentation will probably be ready
     before Christmas, and after that development will continue. Subject to
     demand the planned improvements for future versions may include IPv6,
     IPsec, named, extensions to IP-NAT and possibly dial-in support.
   - MiamiSSL: fully supported. A new version that incorporates the latest
     OpenSSL changes and protocols is planned.
   - MiamiTelnet: fully supported, as part of the Miami Deluxe package. Telnet
     encryption and support for running in a shell window are planned for
     future versions.
   - ppp.device: still supported, but no new versions are planned. Miami and
     Miami Deluxe should be considered successors of ppp.device.
   - ReOrg: not supported at this time. A version with support for NSD and disks
     > 4 GB is something I am considering though, time permitting.

I will also have to move my residence from Winter Park, Florida to Ukiah,
California, where REBOL headquarters are located. This means my LAN will have to
move as well, including the server that handles Miami registrations and orders.
Because of that there will be some service outages affecting my Internet
presence during the months of December '99 and possibly January 2000. Please see
my separate announcements about that. On the up side, chances are my LAN will
get a DSL connection in Ukiah, which should provide better reliability and much
faster responses, in particular for mailing lists, than the current 56k
connection.

Wishing everyone a happy holiday season and a successful year 2000.

           NOVA DESIGN AND NEWTEK ANNOUNCE AVAILABILITY OF MILLENNIUM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Millennium is Here!

Millennium for the Amiga Video Toaster/Flyer is here now. It's extremely cool,
it's wildly powerful, and it will give your Toaster and Toaster/Flyer amazing
new powers to help you make your work look better than ever before!

The Millennium package is presented by Newtek and has been produced by Nova
Design, Inc. in cooperation with all prominent Toaster/Flyer developers. It is
not to be missed.

What's Inside

Millennium is not merely a single package. It is a collection of software,
scripts, effects, fonts, backgrounds, and other content designed to update your
Video Toaster and Flyer dramatically. Millennium was designed to be the largest,
most comprehensive, upgrade you could put on your system. Millennium is for the
Toaster owner as well as the Flyer owner.

You'll find some old favorites are now part of the Millennium package. Some
packages you will be familiar with and some will be brand new to you. Some
existing packages have been upgraded significantly for the Millennium release
and some have been made Toaster-friendly and Flyer-friendly as well. Here is a
list of what you will find in Millennium.

   - Wipe Studio - You may be familiar with the 'lite' version-but this is the
     complete package! Use it to create your own wipes and effects for the
     Toaster and Flyer.
   - RenderFX - Upgraded for Millennium, this package allows you to render your
     FlyerClip sequences down to a new FlyerClip. You can then layer more
     video, CG, and effects for a far more impressive production.
   - Flyer Utilities - Includes utilities for converting Toaster wipes between
     3.x and 4.x formats, Undeleting FlyerClips, Timecoding and much more.
   - ProMix - Also upgraded for Millennium, this package provides audio tools to
     let you add audio to video, import/export audio formats, add audio to
     FlyerClips and animations, and more.
   - Fast Frames - Allows you to 'Toasterize' your Video Flyer by pre-recording
     CG sequences, Framestore montages, and create flying CG effects and more.
   - Fast Fuel - Adds video deck control to the Toaster/Flyer interface for
     automatic clip recording.
   - Electric Scene Knife - This can save you literally hours of work. The Knife
     can take a FlyerClip and automatically find the different scenes within it,
     mark them, and even offer to cut them into separate FlyerClips for you.
   - Flyer Backup - A script based system that can backup your actual FlyerClips
     to a hard drive or to removable media.
   - CGPilot - The famous CG ARexx scripts that automate many time consuming CG
     tasks.
   - Toaster Wipes and Effects - There are hundreds of these and most are
     available for both Toaster 3.x and 4.x so both Toaster and Flyer owners
     can use them. These include wedding wipes, fire wipes, basic animated
     wipes, cool soft gradient wipes, and fully rotoscoped motion matte wipes.
   - MegFX - 41 Flyer-project croutons, which produce real-time dual-stream
     split-screen effects and real-time layer-mixed dual-stream effects
     directly in Flyer projects.
   - Backgrounds - Hundreds of full color, professionally drawn, backgrounds for
     you to use in your CG pages or in ToasterPaint.
   - Control Tower - Adds tons of new effects and macros to your Flyer system.
   - Full motion backgrounds - FlyerClips of animated scenes, fire, and more.
     You can use these with your Flyer for CG backgrounds or as royalty-free
     stock footage.

There are many other features of Millennium. We've really just touched the
surface of all the tools and content that are included in Millennium to make
your Toaster and Flyer more productive for you. Millennium also includes
hundreds of new ARexx commands for scripting, programmer's manuals for the

                  AMIGA SURVIVOR MAGAZINE ANNOUNCES NEW ISSUE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For months, many people have wondered whether or not they would see another
issue of Amiga Survivor, well, I'm pleased to announce that the latest issue (8)
is now available, and is now available for order from
www.crystal-software.com/AmigaSurvivor/survindex.html But that's not all the
news I have brought for you today, the editor of Amiga Survivor, Robert Iveson
has decided to pass the reigns entirely to Crystal Interactive Software, who are
currently in need of assistance on future issues of this well respected
magazine.

We are currently looking for people willing to fill the following positions:

EDITOR

Mr. Iveson's gone, so we'll be needing an editor. Your duties will include
chopping and changing documents accordingly, contacting developers for review
material and special features for inclusion of each issue. And keeping writers
in check.

WRITERS

We need reviewers with a good head for games or serious software. News writers
and previewers who can collate relevant information from the internet, and
re-write accordingly. Excellent written English is essential, as is a good sense
of humour. A good knowledge of the Amiga is essential, and a top spec Amiga
set-up is beneficial.

PAGE DESIGNER

For page layouts. Must have good knowledge of DTP and a keen eye for design. DTP
on an Amiga is preferred (such as Pagestream 3.3+), or any program that is
capable of disk output of EPS or various image formats.

Further information can be obtained from the official Amiga Survivor website
(www.crystal-software.com/AmigaSurvivor/survindex.html)

Or contact Andrew Reed of Crystal Interactive Software directly on:
andy@crystal-software.com

We look forward to hearing from you soon!

             HYPERION LICENCES FREESPACE: THE GREAT WAR FOR AMIGA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14-December-1999

Hyperion is pleased to announce it has acquired a license from Interplay to port
Volition's best-selling space-combat simulator "(Descent) Freespace: The Great
War" to the Amiga.

System-requirements include PPC processor (WarpOS), graphics-card (AGA under
review) and 32 MB RAM with full support of 3D accelerators through Warp3D. A
68060 version is not ruled out but would most likely require 3D acceleration.
Confirmed members of the programming team include Hans-Joerg Frieden and
Christian Sauer. The game is tentatively slated for release early Q2 2000 and
will be published by Titan Computers.

"Descent Freespace pushed the genre of the space-combat simulators into new
realms of realism and graphical excellence", says Ben Hermans, managing partner
of Hyperion. "We are therefore very excited to bring this unrivaled experience
to the Amiga especially because the genre has been notably absent on the Amiga
in recent years. With Descent Freespace we continue to deliver on our promise of
bringing high-end bestsellers to the Amiga platform. If users ever needed a
reason to upgrade to PPC, this is it."

More info soon...

                        H&P POP-BASED AMIGA MOTHERBOARD?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although I ussually do not like rumors, there is a very interesting rumor
running through the net, according to which, H&P is planning to release a
POP-based Amiga motherboard.

This rumor appeared first when H&P showed such a board in HEW'99, held last
month in Köln. It seems that they are now waiting for a YES from Gateway.

In case you don't know, POP is the PowerPC Open Platform designed by IBM
Basically, it is an ATX form board with PCI, AGP, and a PowerPC processor. It
was designed by IBM, but they released the design for anyone to build and adopt.

Read more at: http://www.chips.ibm.com/products/powerpc/linux/

There is a schematic of the board and a faq.

                                 LAMBDA STATUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lambda is a freelance project striving to create a high quality 3D space action
game with a compelling storyline. It is being developed totally
non-professionally by four men in their free time with no salary - just an urge
to make a dream come true.

Some of the most basic services of the new 3D engine have been defined and also
implemented in OpenGL. The engine is still nothing more than a fancy mouse
driven object viewer, but the code beneath the surface is slowly maturing. The
only really new features are colored lighting and reflection mapping, both of
which are readily provided by OpenGL. For the software rendering engine they
will of course have to be written from scratch. For the software renderer it is
probably wise to also offer an option for switching to monochromatic lighting,
which should be faster.

Work on the virtual machine has also finally been started, though many problems
still need to be solved and many questions answered. Some basic definitions have
been made, but due to technical vs. idealistic problems it may take a while
before I get started properly.

The news of Descent: Freespace coming to the Amiga was initially a punch in the
face. After all, one of the reasons we started developing Lambda was the lack of
modern 3D space action games for the Amiga. After the initial shock I decided
that we would still do our best and perhaps even beat Freespace. We do need to
try to move a little further away from the Freespace gameplay, though, to
prevent unwanted redundancy in the genre. Since the beginning of the project the
competition is now tougher than ever; something we should have anticipated. Now
we'll just have to work even harder.

http://www.worldfoundry.com/.

All applications must be in by the 23rd December 1999.

About the Company
The World Foundry has been around as a group of Amiga developers since September
'97 with the aim of developing high quality, high specification Amiga games. It
became an LLC in February '99.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi,

It's nice to see that as soon as there's no V update for a month, people start
worrying of whether we ran away to the bahamas, or shut down, or both. In any
case, the reports of our deaths have been greatly exaggerated :)

As I said when pre5 was released, we were heading to a "proper" release, and
this mostly involves wading through the masses of bug reports (thanks!), and
sorting them out.

However, debugging is a slow process, and we wanted to squash as many bugs as
possible, to release something which warrants a "Proper release" label.

I've attached a current list of changes since pre5 below, so you'll believe us
that we didn't slack around.

The current plan is to release 3.0 proper before X-Mas.

We'll both then have more free time to work on V 3.1 between the years, to add
some features (there's a working Real Audio decoder source lingering around, and
the concept of an CSS parser, and stuff :)

3.0.38

   - CVS: bumped compile to .38

     zero-terminated. This is presumbly the reason for the source editing ->
     update crashes (Olli)
   - GUI: modified docinfowin to not cause a layout failure with long URLs
     (www.boxman.dk) (Olli)
   - Cache: resuming a file which was in the disk cache wasn't performed
     properly and ended up appending the whole file instead of the relevant
     part (Zapek)

     the cache (Zapek)

   - Cache: of course some servers have to not support timezones properly for

     servers to send you documents in your prefered language if it has

                                19 December 1999


The News

The game has progressed quite a bit since last time. The latest improvements
include:

   - Adding lens flares to the game engine, as well as making the shockwaves
     look a lot better.
   - I've put some new screenshots up
     http://www.apex-designs.net/payback_screens.html.
   - It's possible to have scripted conversations with characters in the game.
   - Car doors work properly now. (i.e. they're the right colour and in the
     right place. :)
   - The game now tells you the name of the vehicle as you get into it.
   - Squashed some more bugs.

Well, that's all for the time being. Have a merry Christmas and a happy New
Year!

                         BUBBLE HEROES DEMO II RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second public demo of Bubble Heroes has been released! This demo is, again,
for AGA only machines, although it works with my Picasso IV graphic card. Its
authors, Arcadia developments, are unable to upload the RTG version of the game
yet. The system requirements are the same of the previous demo.

To play this demo, and all the future ones to come, you must have all the
previous demos (in this case only the BHDemo1) properly installed on your hard
drive. Then, you have to enter the directory where you keep Bubble Heroes and
decompress the new lzx archive in it. They made this decision to make us
download smaller archives every time a new demo become available. Also very
important: always answer 'YES' to requests for files overwriting during the
decompression process (as some of them have to be replaced)!

Download it from http://www.made.net/~arcadia/BHDemo2.lzx (1320Kb)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: <info@clickboom.com>

TORONTO, December 20, 1999:

clickBOOM's Millennium Madness continues -- the biggest Amiga game ever will be
ready very soon, so it's time to show you more of it.

We have prepared the Nightlong movie trailer to whet your appettite while
waiting for the game.

It's a cool teaser to show what the game looks like in motion. Mind you, it's in
low res, and not too long so it wouldn't take forever to download. You'll have
to try to imagine it at 640x480 16-bit gfx and 16-bit sound. :)

Full specs for Nightlong will be available in a few days.

Best regards,
clickBOOM

                     CLICKBOOM'S S-FILES - FILE 1: WELCOME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"What are the S-Files ??" you might be wondering.

Well, it's a little corner where we'll address you from time to time, in a very
relaxed and friendly fashion.

One question we are very frequently asked is "what's new at clickBOOM?" And so,
we want you to feel a little closer to clickBOOM and to be more in touch with
what we've been doing and what our short term plans are.

I'm sure you'd all agree that it would be wonderful if we could all get together
somewhere once a month and talk, but unfortunately I checked and the airlines
are not willing to give us any free tickets :(( ...... so, for the time being, I
will bring you a little closer to clickBOOM here at The S-Files :))

I will try my best to update S-files at least once a month, but it will all
depend on the amount of time I have for it.

Now that you know what S-Files is all about, let's get started.....

Firts off I would like to say that everyone at clickBOOM wishes you all the Very
Best for the Holiday Season and the New Millennium !!!

What's new this month? Well, as you can see, we have the Millennium Madness
going on, with a lot of different things happening. I certainly hope you saw the
Nightlong movie trailer!

And what's coming up? I'm glad you asked, because I have convinced the guys here
that we must change our direction and start developing more games for girls...
so this means no more action, no more violence !!!! The first game will be
called "Sarrah goes shopping"...

OK, ok, I am just kidding, I had to tease you guys just a little. ;-) I've
always wanted to do that.

What you will really see in the next 10 days is:

   - Nightlong full specs and details (technical, release date, ordering...)
   - A new direction in our development, called Project TNT.
   - What our stand on PPC support and future Amiga development is.
   - A crazy offer - we will give you all of our games if you do something...
     come back and see what it is! :)
   - and more...

Let me know what you think about S-files...

Ciao,
Sofia

@node not23 "IMMORTAL CD HAS BEEN RELEASED"

                         IMMORTAL CD HAS BEEN RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Immortal is a videogame soundtrack album with a special CD-Rom data section for
computer owners.

Videogame music began with a few clumsy beeps from the games in the early 80's,
but with the rapid evolution in computer technology, game tunes became major
studio productions and the videogame music style affirmed itself as a
respectable genre in the world of music. The Amiga computer was one of the first
machines featuring fantastic music in it's games. Some of this music has now
been revamped into studio quality in Immortal.

Immortal started to take shape in the mind of Amiga game music composer Ruben
Monteiro back in March 1997, with the idea of creating an Audio cd with studio
enhancements of classic Amiga game tunes. Since it would contain only music from
the Amiga computer's golden era of 1989-1993, it was to be called 'Roots',
refering that music as precisely the root of videogame music of nowadays.

As he progressed development, he started to notice the work of the recent Amiga
musicians. They sounded equally as exciting, and still not available in CDaudio
format, so he got in touch with musicians Jochen Heizmann, Darryl Sloan who were
to create studio mixes of their game music, and later Bjorn Lynne, who licensed
some of his game and album music for Immortal.

Later in 1998, Amiga game music legends Allister Brimble, probably the best
Amiga game composer ever, and Barry Leitch, one of the best musicians from the
Commodore64 computer scene and also Amiga, joined the Immortal productive team.

Immortal is one of the most featured and complete music albums ever. In there
you'll find the full soundtrack from the gameShadow of the Beast, additional
music fromDafel: Bloodline, Project X (new 99 version), Superfrog, BlockheadII,
The Strangers, The Final Odyssey, Harlequin, Utopia, Alien Breed 3D, Space
Station 3000, Gunbee F-99,  andTurrican (new special version of the level 5
music from the first chapter of the series).

On the computer data part, there's the Immortal videoclip.

@node not25 "QUAKE 1 SOURCE CODE RELEASED"

                          QUAKE 1 SOURCE CODE RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rumours were floating around about the release of the Quake 1 source code at the
end of the year. This has become a reality because Id Software have put the
complete source code for winquake, glquake, quakeworld, and glquakeworld into
the public domain.

The code is all licensed under the terms of the GPL (gnu public license). You
should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do anything
you want with the code, including sell your new version. The catch is that if
you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the entire source
code available for free to everyone.

All of the Quake data files remain copyrighted and licensed under the original
terms, so you cannot redistribute data from the original game, but if you do a
true total conversion, you can create a standalone game based on this code.

If you never actually bought a complete version of Quake, you might want to
rummage around in a local software bargain bin for one of the originals, or
perhaps buy the 68k version made by clickBOOM time ago.

Probably the first WarpOS version we will see will be the one by Steffen
Hausser, which is expected to be released on Sunday, December 27th.
Unfortunately, this version will not support Warp3D, as this will require a lot
of effort. Probably, we will see a Warp3D version in Spring 2000.

                              All Rights Reserved.

This is an upgrade to Thor 2.6 and requires 2.6 previously installed. The
upgrade fixes the following issues:

   - Will add 1900 to any 70<year<1900 when parsing messages, and 2000 to any
     year <70. Uses 4 digits for the year on outgoing messages.
   - Selecting using keyboard should work a whole lot better in the conf window
     now.
   - The save window will now be closed along with the other windows when
     selecting quit while it's open.
   - The Conferences window will not "lose" the EMail conference when it's
     moving into a folder.
   - The userlist in the user window will now come up as sorted when the window
     is first opened.
   - Locale files from 2.6 should now work correctly
   - other minor issues

To install this upgrade, unarchive the lha archive into the directory where you
installed Thor.

QUESTIONS?

There is a newsgroup for Thor with the name of alt.sys.amiga.thor. If the group
is not available at your newsserver, ask for it by sending a mail to your system

Just 2 days ago I told you guys that S-files would be a monthly thing, but
already we've got some hot news to share with you, so here is my second file
already.

I am happy to announce that the creator of Quake, id software's legendary John
Carmack, has released Quake sources on the Internet.

As you probably know, we had a lot of trouble with the PPC version of Quake --
first Amiga Inc. went the non-PPC way, then there was a big problem with piracy,
then an illegal PPC version of the code appeared on Aminet, etc. On top of that,
QuakeWorld was a non-commercial product on PC, so we couldn't create that
either.

Therefore, no matter how much we wanted to see Quake on PPC Amigas, we were
really stuck from the commercial point of view. Then, at the beginning of the
year we were told that John would release Quake sources, and we were releived,
because we knew that would open doors for legal PPC Quake code created by
talented Amiga programmers.

So, the wait is over, and we can finally put all the Quake PPC troubles behind
-- anyone on Amiga can compile and modify those sources to create a PPC Amiga
executable. Of course, there is more to it than just PPC -- Warp3D, QuakeWorld
and other interesting developments can and should happen, as well.

However, if you are going to be involved in any form of distribution of the
newly created executables please, please, please, READ AND OBEY THE GNU LICENCE.
Also, please note what John says:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"All of the Quake data files remain copyrighted and licensed under the original
terms, so you cannot redistribute data from the original game..."

Briefly, what this means is that you can create new Quake PPC, QuakeWorld and
other executables and spread THE CODE freely around, but you MAY NOT COPY QUAKE
LEVELS, TEXTURES, or other files found on the Quake CD.

Also, if you wish to use new Quake PPC executables YOU MUST OWN A COPY OF QUAKE.
To buy Quake, just go http://pxlcomputers.com/shopping.html.

So, the next step is to finally have a legal PPC version of Quake. If you are a
programmer and would like to work with Quake sources, download John's original
archive here. Then, let us know at info@clickboom.com that you want to work on
it, and we will help you and other Amiga programmers to cooperate, so that PPC
versions (as well as QuakeWorld) are top-notch. Also, that will help unnecessary
overlapping of work (ie. two guys working on the same part of the code).

And last, but certainly not least, we will post all of the Quake executables on
our web site for users to download. So, let's create "The New Tomorrow" Quake.

                     COSA PROGRESS UPDATE FOR DECEMBER 1999

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              COSA PROGRESS UPDATE
                               DECEMBER 24, 1999

                       An Open Letter - December 24, 1999
                       By COSA President, Steve Crietzman

Introduction

Since our first open letter to the Amiga community, there has been a great deal
of progress and many behind-the-scenes changes to the internal structure and
focus of COSA. We want to keep the community up-to-date on these changes, and so
after the new year we will provide much more detailed information on our plans
for the new millennium.

We would like to use this update to touch on an area that has not received much
discussion to date, and that is our talks with Tom Schmidt. Since so few people
get to talk with him, we thought it would be helpful for the community to hear
our perspective on the man who is now at the helm of Amiga.

This update focuses on our talks with Tom Schmidt. The next update, after the
new year, will discuss our plans for the new millenium, and hopefully, by the
third update two weeks later, we will have something solid to report from Amiga
Inc. We will keep you informed.

Your feedback and comments are welcome.

Negotiations with Amiga Inc's Tom Schmidt: The Man at the Helm of Amiga.

COSA have maintained our open line to Tom Schmidt at Amiga. We thought we should
share some broad background information with our members, and provide our
assessment and perspective of the man who is now at the helm of Amiga, based on
our own experiences and dialogues with him.

We are aware that our president is probably one of only a handful of Amigans who
have had the opportunity to speak to Amiga President Tom Schmidt since he took
over the helm of Amiga in September. We thought Amigans might appreciate hearing
our perspective on both Mr Schmidt as a person, and on Amiga as a company.

First of all, one thing is clear: behind the scenes, Mr Schmidt is a very busy
man. There is clearly a lot of activity going on behind the scenes, and Amiga
are hard at work on their projects. For Amiga at least, it seems to be a case of
"business as usual." We have spoken briefly to a number of people inside Amiga
Inc, including a programmer - so yes, they're definately working on something.
But in the words of that same programmer "it doesn't have to do with the classic
Amiga, [and] I don't know about that, you will have to speak to someone else."

Mr Schmidt himself is not the unreasonable tyrant that some have painted him to
be. We have found him to be a polite and very reasonable negotiator, who is much
misunderstood. His decisions relating to the future of Amiga as a company are
based on solid, practical business reasons, and we suspect on Gateway's need for
Amiga to be their subsidary focusing on Information Appliances.

It is our feeling and belief that Gateway never intended for Amiga to deliver a
next-generation Amiga computer system, or operating system, or sucessor to the
traditional line of Amiga computers, but to create operating system software
(Operating Environments) for the emerging Information Appliances market, a
potentially multi-billion dollar industry in which Amiga looks set to become a
key player.

In this context, Tom Schmidt as President and CEO of Amiga is merely following
the plan that Gateway had originally intended for Amiga as a company, as a
strategic software group targeting the next generation of computing devices.

That said, Mr Schmidt is aware of the concerns of the Amiga community and is
sympathetic to our concerns. As indicated in his most recent executive update,
Mr Schmidt wishes to find a solution that will address the needs of the Amiga
community. We believe, from his words and from our own dealings with him, that
he is most sincere when he says this. He admires the fact we have "hung in
there" through thick and thin, and in his own words, "[we] deserve better". It
is simply the case that Amiga Inc's mandate from Gateway does not and cannot
include directly tackling the needs of the Amiga community. Amiga Inc has most
likely been told to focus completely on information appliances.

But it remains the case that Amiga and Gateway own a number of patents and
trademarks from the "classic" Amiga portfolio that are no longer of any use to
them, unused and "gathering dust". They certainly seem willing to discuss
options on how this technology can be used.

It is on this basis that COSA have been negotiating with Amiga.

Our proposal is that open-sourcing the Amiga operating system frees the
operating system in ways essential to the long-term survival, expansion and
growth of our platform, and that both the Amiga community and Amiga Inc can
share in the rewards (and revenue stream) and new flexibility and freedom that
Open Source can bring.

Our negotiations with Amiga have focused on strategies that could be of benefit
to Amiga Inc if they open-source the classic Amiga OS. We have put them forward
as common-sense business proposals that are of little risk, and much potential
benefit, to Amiga, and of great benefit to the Amiga OS's long-term survival and
growth, and thus good for the Amiga community. We proposed that this would lead
to much positive publicity for the Amiga OS, and for Amiga the company, and that
opening the OS and releasing it to the common ownership of the Amiga community
would be a show of good faith on the part of Amiga Inc, to the classic Amiga
community.

The response from Amiga has been to allow COSA an open line to Tom Schmidt's
office, to negotiate and discuss proposals with them. I would describe our
negotiations as polite, cordial and productive.

The Amiga community needs to realise that Tom Schmidt is not the villain some
paint him to be. At worst, he is a businessman who has been forced to make
difficult, unpopular decisions. I certainly do not believe the intent was a
malicious one. If this was the intent, he would not even be considering COSA's
proposals or discuss ways Amiga could make amends for their recent decisions.
But they have. COSA has an open line to Tom Schmidt, and discussions on both
sides I have found to be fair, professional and productive. He has not
completely cut off contact with the Amiga community - he maintains an open line
to those who show an interest in productive, reasoned negotiation. He is a fine
businessman who has been too harshly judged in my opinion. While his decisions
have not been favourable for the community, I suspect many of these were forced
by circumstance, or due to orders and mandates from above in the Gateway
hierarchy. It is thus not fair to blame Mr Schmidt for these decisions, and I
feel he should be judged not by decisions forced by circumstance, but how he
responds to fair, reasonable and common-sense proposals brought to him by the
Amiga community. I have a feeling that Amigans may be pleasantly surprised to
find that Mr Schmidt is very reasonable and will listen to good proposals, and I
suspect he will support causes that advance the classic Amiga provided we
respect Amiga's right to pursue it's own business strategies.

I realise the above may not be what many people want to hear, but I highly
suspect it is the truth, based on my own experiences in talks with Tom Schmidt
and Amiga Inc, and from other information that has been shared with me. It is
all too easy to blame the President and CEO of a company when we don't like what
they are doing. This is fair where the President and CEO enjoys completely
autonomy and the ability to shape the company to his own desire, but I suspect
in the case of Tom Schmidt he must operate Amiga Inc within certain forced
paramaters and boundaries set by Gateway.

I suspect these boundaries would allow Tom Schmidt to negotiate with Amiga
organisations and consider proposals for using the classic Amiga technology, but
bind him from taking on any classic projects of his own at Amiga Inc.
Negotiations with Amiga and Tom Schmidt may yet prove fruitful, and if they do,
we'll know COSA was right about him. Let's just hope he says "yes" to our
proposal. I remain optimisticly hopeful that something can be negotiated with
Amiga, and we will continue to hold talks with them for as long as there is a
sign of light at the end of the tunnel. We'll keep you updated on our progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Oliver Wagner" <owagner@vapor.com>

Hi,

below is the official announcement of the MorphOS project, probably the first
major Amiga market news relevant for the Amiga's future development for years.

The VaporWare team is currently working together with the MorphOS developers to
make sure that the current VaporWare applications are working nicely in the m68k
emulation session of MorphOS. So far, it works just great :)

Please note that MorphOS itself is not a VaporWare project. We're just providing
hosting for the product support pages and mailing lists, because we strongly
believe in the project's potential.

                          MorphOS Project Announcement

Thursday, 23rd December 1999

Today we announce the availability of a new Amiga next generation PowerPC OS
project, called MorphOS, to the public.

In its current state it provides a modern memory protection microkernel which
runs a virtual amiga emulation. This microkernel will be the base for a new OS
layer.

Research for this project started in early 1998, while at the end of 1998 an
early implementation was ready. In 1999, we started on the virtual amiga
emulation to make the current AmigaOS available without requiring 68K hardware.
The basic design goals behind MorphOS are

   - memory protection
   - resource tracking
   - asynchronous message system
   - low interrupt latency
   - virtual memory (optional)
   - distributed computing
   - symmetrical multi processing (SMP)
   - recursive memory management
   - task/thread and clan/chief model
   - clean design with an elegant API
   - micro/pico kernel mixture

The developer release is planned for end of January. Minimum system requirements
are

   - A4000 with CyberStorm PPC/604e and Symbios 770 SCSI
   - CyberVisionPPC
   - at least 32MB memory installed
   - Kickstart 3.1 (Version 40.68) and Workbench 3.1 or up

Hardware requirements might change as soon as more hardware setups are tested
and implemented.

As the success of this project will also depend on your feedback/support, we
suggest that interested developers visit our project webpage for a general
MorphOS overview and information on how to join us to help.

Feel free to enter the project webpage at

   - http://www.morphos.de or

                             V³ 3.0 FINAL RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Oliver Wagner" <owagner@vapor.com>

Here it is: the final version of V³

   - ftp://ftp.vapor.com/pub/ voyager/v3_30.lzx (1.035.068 bytes)

Core changes since pre5:

   - Now remembers FORM contents on back and, erm, window resize
   - HTTP/1.1 Accept-Language: support
   - Support for URL-embedded password support in HTTP URLs
   - Image information summary added
   - New Search Central plugin
   - The usual load of bugfixes and minor enhancements.

This release does not include a new VFlash plugin. It is currently undergoing
final testing, and will be released individually within the next few days.

Note that "final" doesn't mean the sudden cease of any development -- it simply
means the next version will be 3.1. We considered V³ to be stable enough to be
called a real release by now, though, however much work is still to be done to
keep up with the ongoing development of Web technology.

  2. POLL: PowerPC support

     Do you think PowerPC support for games and programs is good or not? This
     means more time for development and probably also higher prices. Do you
     think 68k is dead? Let us know! :)

     Please select one of the following:

      - Yes, PowerPC is the future and 68k is dead!
      - PowerPC support is okay, but 68k is nice too.
      - 68k first, do PowerPC support only if it's worth doing.
      - 68k rules, PowerPC sucks!
      - Which's the difference? (ehm ) :-)

                    GATEWAY SELLS AMIGA TO EX-AMIGA EMPLOYEE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gateway has finally rid itself of the legacy of its acquisition of Amiga with a
close-of-year sale of the Amiga hardware spec., system software and brandname to
Amino on undisclosed terms.

And who do we find runs Amino? Step forward, Bill McEwen, the former Amiga, Inc.
marketing chief who quit the company earlier this year just before ex-president
Jim Collas was given the boot.

McEwen is well respected by the Amiga community, so his acquisition of the Amiga
is likely to be received postively -- doubly so since Gateway has long been
viewed as the Amiga world's chief bete noire, responsible not only for giving
Collas the push but for masterminding the software-only strategy pursued by his
successor, Tom Schmidt, a move that for many Amiga users was a tacit admission
that Gateway was never really interested in reviving the Amiga brand.

In fact, it may well have been interested in doing just that but to use it as
the basis for its own Internet appliance line. The snag here is the brand's poor
level of recognition outside the community, and the company may have felt that a
new brand, one not sullied by years in the IT wilderness, is probably more
appropriate.

The work on the next-generation software technologies begun under Collas and
continued under Schmidt will be folded into Gateway's own Net device product
development operation, the company said.

Not surprisingly, the deal doesn't include Amiga-related patents awarded since
1997 -- Gateway is hanging on to those.

Given Gateway's lack of interest in the 'classic' Amiga, the sale should at
least see its continued existence as a computer platform. As yet, Amino hasn't
said what its plans for the classic Amiga, but a move into the open source world
seems a likely move.

The Campaign to Open Source the Amiga (COSA), has been negotiating to open up
the classic Amiga OS for some time, so far without success (though Schmidt did
seem broadly receptive to the idea). COSA's argument is that the Amiga platform
only has a future if it expands its user base, and the best way of doing that is
to open it up in the hope of winning the same kind of broad support that Linux
has achieved.

Certainly, the influx of new talent that such a move would encourage if the
Amiga platform isn't to dwindle further and become nothing more than a refuge
for die-hards and 80s retro fans.

@node not38 "QUAKE NEWS"

                                   QUAKE NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On December 21st, ID Software released the source code of winquake, glquake,
quakeworld and glquakeworld under GNU Public License (GPL) and made them
available by ftp. Some week after that, we have already two legal Quake ports
for Amiga.

The first one is called AWinQuake, and it has been developed by Peter McGavin,
who did the best Doom port for Amiga: ADoom. AWinQuake is based on winquake, due
to the fact that winquake is well written and extremely portable, so it didn't
take long to get it working on an Amiga by cutting and pasting code from other
projects.

FEATURES:

   - Both 68k and PPC versions are provided.
   - Both versions are OS-friendly and multitask.
   - Both versions put up an ASL requester for the ScreenMode.
   - awinquakeppc uses Joseph Fenton's PPC c2p routine from ADoomPPC and triple
     buffering in AGA modes.
   - Sound effects are included. Also CD audio for music works if you use
     ClickBoom's AmigaQuake CDROM. You need cdplayer.library (from Aminet) for
     this.
   - Networking for TCP/IP is included.
   - awinquakeppc works with either PowerUp or WarpOS. With WarpOS, use Frank
     Wille's ppc emulation library.
   - awinquakeppc is mostly compiled with SAS/C scppc. However, the innermost
     rendering routines are compiled with ppc-amigaos-gcc. This results in a
     small speedup (about 3%) over compiling everything with scppc.
   - His modified source code should still compile for Linux (APUS), Solaris,
     Win95, etc, with no changes --- untested.
   - Speeds over 37 fps have been observed for "timedemo demo2" in 320x200 on a
     233 MHz PPC Amiga 3000 with CyberVisionPPC.
   - Added a -fps option, but see the note below about bus speed before you
     believe the numbers you see.

LIMITATIONS:

   - The 68k version is much slower than ClickBoom's commercial version.
   - Only the PPC version has optimised c2p for AGA. In fact the 68k version is
     not recommended. Buy Clickboom's version instead.
   - Only keyboard control. No mouse, joystick or joypad yet.
   - No AHI.
   - No very much optimisation.

REQUIREMENTS:

   - A 68020+ Amiga running at least OS 3.1, with at least about 16 Mb of
     fastmem.
   - An FPU is required.
   - You need either a gfx-card or AGA. ECS alone is not sufficient.
   - A TCP/IP stack is required for networking, e.g, AmiTCP or Miami. An
     ethernet card is strongly recommended.
   - A stack size of 500000 bytes. I'm not sure what the minimum stack size is.
     150000 bytes is definitely too small.
   - An MMU is neither required nor used.
   - You need cdplayer.library from Aminet, or start with -nocdaudio. The game
     searches for Clickboom's CDROM for cdaudio (volume name "QUAKE".)
   - You need the Quake 1 PAK files and other support files from either a
     commercial or shareware version of Quake. Assuming you've already
     installed AmigaQuake or a PC version, put awinquake or awinquakeppc in the
     same directory as the original quake executable.

You can download the Peter's port from Aminet:

   - http://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/aminet/aminet/game/shoot/awinquake.lha (572374
     bytes)

On the other hand, Steffen Haeuser and Frank Ville have released a first Beta
version of the Quake 1.09 and QuakeWorld Port. The Beta Version includes
binaries for WarpUP (vbcc-WarpUP compiled) and PowerUP (vbcc-PowerUP compiled)
of QuakePPC. The list of features includes:

   - GFX Board and AGA Support
   - Support for PIP (Picasso 96) and WB Window
   - Double- and Triplebuffering
   - Sound
   - CD Audio Support
   - Mouse, Joypad and Joystick Support
   - In-Game Video-Options
   - Network Support
   - QuakeWorld Support (Client and Server)

This is only a Beta version, later it is planned to enhance this version, to
release a 68k version and much later to add Warp3D support (with the help of
MiniGL) and a comfortable GUI.

Anyway, they are looking for help, so anybody who wants to overtake some part of
the stuff, feel free to contact Steffen at MagicSN@Birdland.es.bawue.de. If
several coders work together, things might speed up to the "perfect Quake Port".

You can download this version from:

   - http://devnull.owl.de/~frank/quake_e.html (Very Slow)
   - http://members.es.tripod.de/debugger/RTGMaster/download.html (Recommended)

1. Introduction

MetalWeb is the first WYSIWYG HTML editor for AmigaOS. The philsophy behind the
software is that you should not need to understand HTML in order to create pages
within MetalWEB. You can create web pages via a DTP style editor or the 'old
way' via a tabbed, coloured text based source window. Indeed, like the
award-winning Dreamweaver you can open both the edit and source window, work
within one of the windows, whilst the other window updates, automagically!

2. Note for registered MetalWeb users

MetalWeb 4 requires a keyfile to work. The upgrade for registered MetalWeb (1, 2
and 3) users is 20$.

@node not40 "GATEWAY SELLS AMIGA NAME AND TRADEMARKS TO AMINO"

                    GATEWAY SELLS AMIGA TRADEMARKS TO AMINO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was only a rumour some time ago, but now it has become a reality.

Gateway Inc. signed a deal to sell its Amiga trademarks and computer systems to
Amino Development Corp., a privately held company based in Maple Valley, WA, and
founded by Fleecy Moss and Bill McEwen some time after the second was fired by
Gateway in September. So far, the terms of the transaction have been not
disclosed but a press release from Amino is expected to be released next week.

The transaction is effective immediately and includes the transfer of all
Internet domain names related to Amiga held by Gateway. Amiga patents will
continue to be held by Gateway, which it gained when it acquired Amiga in April
1997.

Peter Ashkin, Gateway senior vice president, said that the company elected to
sell the name after deciding to wrap Amiga's software engineering function into
Gateway's product development activity as part of Gateway's overall strategy to
develop and market the coming generation of Internet appliances.

"Amiga, as a personal computer brand, has a loyal following of fans around the
world," Ashkin said. "Under Gateway's wing, Amiga morphed into a software
development company working on a new Internet appliance operating environment
software. Now that we're bringing that development work into Gateway product
development, it made sense to find a buyer for Amiga."

"Yee-haw", said Bill McEwen, president and CEO of Amino. "This is a very
exciting day, and now an even more exciting tomorrow. Now we can finish the job
that was started 15 years ago."

San Diego-based Gateway, which acquired the rights to Amiga's technology in
1997, had been planning to revive the brand, prominent in the mid-1980s, for
so-called information appliances and PCs.

Author: fleecy moss <fleecy@earthlink.org>

Hi there 8-)

Just to keep you informed. Amino, the company founded by Bill and myself has
bought Amiga from Gateway. There were supposed to release a PR so that ppl (well
ppl who like celebrating) would have an additional reason to look forwards to
the new year. It was supposed to come out yesterday, but in typical Gateway
fashion, they even screwed that up ;-)

We will prepare a press release shortly, but the investment round, buyout, and
dealing with Gateway has left both Bill and myself knackered, and our families
seriously neglected over the holiday.

Please excuse us if we take some time out to recover and be in arse kicking form
for the next year. We know we'll have only a short time to prove ourselves, even
shorter if certain people start posting, but this is not something we have just
knocked together.

Bill and I have been working on this for over 2 years, and the Amiga buyout is
just one (but the most pleasant one) of the pieces on which we have been
toiling. There are big changes coming over the next 5 years in the digital,
computer, and entertainment world, and we have been working to ensure that Amiga
will be right there at the heart of the revolution.

Pump some air into those balls. We've got some boinging to do.

We'd like to thank everyone who has stood by the Amiga and whose individual
efforts have contributed to ensuring that the candle flame has never gone out,
from developers, to users, to just everyday ppl building their websites.

As the native Americans believe, humans cannot own anything, they are just
caretakers. We plan on taking really good care of the Amiga, and taking our
place in the community.

Welcome to Tomorrow.

@node not42 "FIRST OPEN LETTER FROM NEW AMIGA PRESIDENT: BILL MCEWEN"

            FIRST OPEN LETTER FROM NEW AMIGA PRESIDENT: BILL MCEWEN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

January 3, 2000

YeeHaw and welcome to the year 2000;

I want to make something very clear from the beginning we have been told, that
Amiga was purchased by Gateway because of the Patents, and that there were not
even aware of the Amiga installed base, or the people.

Gateway purchased Amiga because of Patents, we purchased Amiga because of the
People.

Without the people standing behind, developing, creating, purchasing and
continuing to believe in the Amiga there never would have been anything for
Gateway to purchase. We recognize this, and it is because of you, and what you
have continued to accomplish with Amiga that we have purchased the company.

I want to make sure that everyone knows and understands what this all means to
you the true Amigans.

Here is what was acquired from Gateway:

   - All trademarks logo's etc.
   - All existing inventory of Amiga International
   - All existing licenses.
   - License to All Amiga patents (Gateway still owns the patents, but we are
     able to use them).
   - All web sites, and registered domain names.
   - The Amiga OS and all that is associated with the OS.
   - The Amiga operation as it exists today.

Specific details of the developer system, the OS partners and how one can begin
developing will be released in the next couple of weeks.

We will be making an announcement on January 8th, 2000 with one of our partners
at CES in Las Vegas, and more details will follow that release.

Fleecy, Myself, Petro, and the rest of the team are not going to make promises
and create presentations and demos. We are going to deliver products, services,
and the rest of the world will know what you have already known.

We will be officially changing the name of Amino Development Corporation to the
Amiga Corporation this week, and we will let everyone know of this change
shortly once it is officially completed.

I want to thank all of you for your continued support we will make Amiga what it
should have been, and more importantly what it will be.

Keeping the faith,

Bill McEwen
President/CEO
Amino Development Corporation

@node not43 "AMINO: WHO HAS BOUGHT AMIGA?"

                          AMINO: WHO HAS BOUGHT AMIGA?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Volker Mohr has done this summary for us

Everybody has heard it: Amino Development (http://www.amino1.net/) has purchased
the rights on the name Amiga, the Internet domain, and most important, on the
Amiga technology developed in the time before Gateway. Not purchased were the
rights on the new multimedia environment, so far been called "AmigaObjects", and
the so-called Amiga MCC. These products, developed during the Gateway era, will
be integrated into the Gateway product line without the name Amiga in the
future.

With other words: What we user would call Amiga does now belong to Amino.

But who is Amino? Basically, Amino consists of two persons: Fleecy Moss and Bill
McEwen. If you had an eye on Amiga Inc. and Gateway in the last few years, these
names will sound familiar to you.

Bill McEwen was employed at Amiga, Inc. as "Head of Marketing and Software
Evangelism". He left the company only days before Jim Collas, not all that
voluntary himself. Before Bill worked at Amiga, Inc., he already was employed by
several other well-known computer companies, but had nothing to do with Amiga.
Despite this, he was immediately impressed by the capabilities of the (original)
Amiga, and very quickly became a convinced member of the Amiga community and a
supporter of the (by Jeff Schindler) so-called "Amiga Classics". Of course he
did not lose the feeling for the need of new hard- and software developments.
So, he was also a supporter of Collas' plans for the so-called AmigaMCC.

Bill McEwen had to leave Amiga, Inc. a few days before Jim Collas. While Collas
was said to have left the company "for personal reasons", Bill never hid that
his contract was not extended. While Bill is no long-standing Amiga fan, he did
not only learn to understand and value the Amiga and his users, but also was
able to win the trust of old Amiga gurus like Dave Haynie and Carl Sassenrath.

Fleecy Moss is also known to most from his time at Amiga, Inc. Little is known
about his time before that. In an interview with the magazine CU Amiga (which
has been closed down in the meantime), October issue 1998, page 30f., he tells a
little bit about himself: "I am British, and currently work in the USA. I am
Project Manager and System Architect, responsible for introducing new special
computer systems. I am Amiga user for 8 years (translator's note: with the
interview being dated 1998), and started with a Commodore Pet and VC 20 at the
age of 11. What I hope to give the Amiga is respect for his philosophy and
community ideals, as well as a good feeling for the future and the digital
information revolution." (translator's note: The above has been re-translated
and might differ slightly from the original, to which I don't have access.)

After Joe Torre, Fleecy Moss was the second important person at Amiga, Inc.
whose contract was not extended. After his departure, Fleecy initiated the KOSH
project (A HREF="http://kosh.convergence.org/">http://kosh.convergence.org/).
KOSH is intended to be "the hardware equivalent to Linux", a computer platform
honoring user wishes and needs, developed as open source. Fleecy knows of course
that such a goal cannot be achieved in short terms. When Gateway canceled the
AmigaMCC plans, Fleecy Moss initiated Amino together with Bill McEwen. There
have been little information about this company. The first impression on the
public was made by the close connection with Phoenix, a connection of several
Amiga distributors and developers with the goal of creating a new platform as an
alternative to the Amiga. This common platform was originally intended to be
based on PPC systems with QNX as operating system. Both was not a final
decission when Phoenix / Amino was founded, but a basis of discussion for common
plans.

So what does the purchase of Amiga by Amino mean? It is clear that the freshly
founded two-man company does not have the funds to continue AmigaOS development
and have new hardware build in short terms. But that is not required
necessarily. To get an impression what can be expected, I recommend having a
close look at the Phoenix pages. The basic difference will probably be that now
there will be no development of an Amiga alternative, but a further development
of the Amiga platform. This means, roughly, that Amiga/Amino will lead the path,
but several other companies will build new Amigas, too. This would bring the
Amiga area a similar situation as in the PC area, where many companies can honor
many special wishes of users. This path of action has several advantages: The
necessary investments are distributed among several companies. Additionally,
this gives added security to the user, since a possible bancruptcy of a single
company would not endanger the whole market. This way, the Amiga as a platform
will be of interest again for new users.

If the future systems will run on a modern AmigaOS, QNX or whatever, or if the
new systems will be based on PPC, that's speculation. It's a fact, however, that
there has been work on the future before the purchase, too, so things don't
start from zero. Especially how new users are to be drawn has to be speculated
about. For sure there has been thought put in this area, too.

I am convinced that many surprises are to be expected soon.
