@{b}------------------------------
"Back in Time 2" now available
------------------------------@{ub}

This  CD has nothing to do  with me, other than the  fact that it's available to
buy from my web site.  Just like it's predecessor, "Back  in Time 2" is a  CD of
famous and much loved tunes from the Commodore 64, all re-worked and re-recorded
with synthesizers and professional studio gear.

Some  of  the  highlights  on  this  CD  includes:  Orchestral versions of Aztec
Challenge and Forbidden Forest  (by Peter Connelly, the  guy who made the  music
for  Tomb  Raider  4).  "Comic  Bakery"  (new  arrangement  by Tomas Danko!) and
"Wizball 2000".  An authentic  reconstruction of  the famous  Zzap Sanxion tape.
The  ultimate version of "Galway is God" ("Rambo"/"Green Beret" loader) arranged
by Jogeir  Liljedahl. Fred  Gray playing  funk guitar.  Mark Cooksey's  very own
studio  version  of  "Ghosts  'n  Goblins".  "Driller"  fans  also  get  a  full
soundtrack-powerful  version  of  this  great  track.  And  there's  lots  more,
including the usual great booklet of facts and entertainment.


@{b}-----------------------------
"Back in Time 2" Extra CDROM
-----------------------------@{ub}

In addition to the music-CD, there is also an extra "Back in Time 2" CDROM. This
is  a new  and improved  CDROM, and  not the  same as  the "old"  CDROM that was
available together with the  original "Back in Time".  The new CDROM contains  a
*lot*  of C64 music in MP3 format, plus interviews, biographies, photos and lots
more.

You can buy just the  music-CD ($19) or both the  music CD and the CDROM  ($29).
But  you cannot buy only the  CDROM. (It's meant as an  extra bonus to the audio
CD).

Lots of ways  to order, both  online and offline,  with or without  credit card.
Fast delivery world wide.

See   http://www.us.lynnemusic.com/lynne/back-in-time-2.html   for   full  track
listing and other details.
