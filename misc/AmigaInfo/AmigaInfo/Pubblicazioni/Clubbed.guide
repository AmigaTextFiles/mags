expensive to cash.

@{b}NEW Credit Cards@{ub}

With the  help of  a friendly  Amiga dealer  Forematt Home  Computing we can now
accept payment for subscriptions on VISA and Mastercard credit cards.

This  is an especially good way  to subscribe if you are  outside the UK as your
credit card company will sort out the currency exchange and usually offer a good
rate.

If  you  wish  to  subscribe  using  your  credit card please give the following
information to Formatt Home Computing:

°Name (as it appears on your credit card)
°Your full postal address
°EMail address (if you have one)
°Telephone number

@{b}Cash@{ub}

If you want to send money in the post please ensure it is well hidden, we cannot
accept liability for cash lost in the post.

Airmail  takes about 3 days, surface mail can take up to 12 weeks (eek!), but in
our experience only takes up to 6 weeks to Australia so it should be shorter for
the rest  of the  world. We  think Royal  Mail must  be covering their asses for
small islands in the Pacific which only have one mail boat a year :).



@{b}PROTECTION@{ub}

If  you  subscribe  and  want  to  cancel  your subscription at any time we will
happily refund you the full cost of any unsent issues. Similarly if  publication
of Clubbed is canceled we will refund the remainder of your subscription.
