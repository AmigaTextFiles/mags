Issue 4 went to print just after the New Year meaning we were able to include
the first news of Amino's buy-out of the Amiga rights from Gateway. However
with events moving very fast we weren't able to cover the Tao partnership and
the recent meetings with the community and developers in Germany and the UK.
To keep readers informed (especially those not on the Internet) we are
including a special "News Update" with issue 4 summarising the latest news.

The partnership with Tao has invalidated some of the comment about QNX in
Gary's interview with Fleecy Moss fortunately however most of the Interview
concentrates on Amino's aims and plans for the future which they are now
fulfilling with the purchase of the Amiga rights.

Website

We've added sample articles from issue three to the website complete with
page thumbnails and decomposing fish:). If you know anyone who might be
interested in Clubbed send them along to http://ww.seal-amiga.co.uk/ where
they can get a good feel for the magazine. Sample articles from issue two
will be added soon.

Issue 5

We've already started work on issue 5, here is the preliminary contents list:

Features
 Reaction to Amino's buyout of Amiga along with all the latest news.
 Interviews with the key players (we hope :) ).
 CD Writing on the Amiga.

Reviews
 fxPaint
 Wildfire 7 PPC
 MakeCD
 BurnIT
 PFS 3
 EIDE '99 Interface and Software
 Grand TV Amazing
 NetConnect 3

Support
 Back to Basics - Topic to be decided.
 Cinema 4D Tutorial
 Hard drives - How to choose fit and prep a hard drive. Plus getting the
               best performance from your existing drives.

NOTE: We had planned a Back to Basics tutorial on monitors and screenmodes
but the latest AmigActive seems to have beaten us to it so we'll cover a
different topic this time... any suggestions?

Help!

For our major feature on CD writing we are looking for a MasterISO user to
write a review. We have reviews underway of MakeCD and BurnIT but no one in
SEAL has MasterISO and Asimware told us that they are not supplying review
copies at this time. So if you have MasterISO and feel like writing a review
please EMail me.

Enjoy issue 4!
