Three-Oh, as loyal Tornado3D users will see, is more than just a new release.

Making  use  of  the  extensive  rewrite  of Tornado3D's code needed for 'Mage.,
Three-Oh has become an entirely new piece of software, and one that is bound  to
make any other Amiga 3D package pale in comparison.

Just  have  a  look  at  the  screenshots  and  at  the  feature  list,  do your
comparisons. We  are confident  you'll agree:  nothing else  comes even close to
Three-Oh.

And  Three-Oh can be yours for free,  buying V2.0 before Three-Oh gets released.

@{b}We are proud to announce Tornado3D V3.0 feature list@{ub}

° Total rewrite! - A new gui, totally revamped.
° Faster, improved Raytracing - diffuse, colored shadows also volumetric
° Particles react to perspective - like 3D objects
° Realtime asyncronous object finder - with kind and name filters
° Realtime Anim controller - with double buffering
° Streamed previews - with disk or ram playback
° Track Panel - Realtime and asynchronous
° Position Automorpher - no need for "make keyframe" anymore
° Bezier - curves and surfaces primitives with tangent editing
° Color keyed primitives - (no more black / white objects)
° New double buffering - replaces the old "videodrivers" system
° Realtime, interactive object adding
° Realtime, interactive extrusion, lathing, replication
° Catmull-Clark's subdivision surfaces - ultra smooth surfaces
° Layers - 8 layers are available for modeling
° Winged-edge like  - polygonal geometry. Faster and uses less memory.
° Color shaded - z-buffered, object display in non-perspective editor windows
° Adaptive degradation - keep framerate, auto restore, n-th face display
° Realtime interactive perspective update
° Free form implicit CSG modeling  - just look at the organic shapes above!
° Clothes and strings - Soft objects animation made easy.
° Mannequins - Male, Female and Alien characters.
° Advanced particle systems - Even more controllable particle systems.
° Advanced force fields - Completly redesigned force field system.
° Footed Animation - No more sliding footsteps or jumping walk-cycles.
° Full Time Inverse Kinematics - Always active, no need to create keyframes.
° MeshMapping - Deforms and fits any kind of imagery to existing meshes.
° Flocks and Herds - Mass-animation of semi-intelligent groups of objects.
° Coons Sculptor - Clay-like shape  builder and deformer. Model polygons,  render
  splines.
° 3D Sound tracing - Virtual mikes to record sounds in 3D.
° 3D Soundtrack builder - A "surround" compatible encoder.
° Sound  and  lip  sync  -  Define  morph  targets  to lip-sync and tie sounds to
  actions.
° RadMapping - Cubic mapping technology simulates Radiosity at blazing speed.
° Assistants - Intelligent scripts that will automate most operations.
° Gobos - Shapeable light sources, also volumetric.
° Envelopes - For function-curve based animation.
° Attachable  engines  -  Control  animation  with  noise  or math other object's
  behaviour.
° Chroma and Luma keying - Key out unwanted backgrounds for SFX work.
° Intensity mapping - Match real and rendered sequences.
° Subtractive alpha channels - Remove non-uniformly colored backgrounds.
° Project scheduler - Manage projects even over a network.
° Render engines - Render engines for a variety of platforms.
° 2D shaper - Full "traditional" 2D modeler, with adaptive Bezier curves.
° N-sided polygonizator - Concave and convex nsided polygons made easy.
° N-sided beveler - Bevel any combination of polygons.
° Broadcast markers - Broadcast Safe and Title area markers on preview.
° Internal virtual memory - Cuts in half rendering memory requirements.
° P-code  Golem scripts - Faster  and safe, allow plugin  writers to resell their
  work.
° Even  faster  PowerPC  -  Full  custom  math  library  and  no  need  for 680x0
  assistance.
° Even faster Permedia2 - Full control over 3D chip parameters and more.
° And much more!
