Professional Word Processor@{ub}


@{" Complete Features List " link "AmigaWriterFeatures" 0}


Writing,  processing and designing  of text will  always be a  standard task for
computers. The same goes with the Amiga. Although there are more and more  voice
recognition  systems being used only  typing the text with  the keyboard will be
skipped. Layouting, correcting and printing  will continue to need the  features
of a excellent word processor.


@{b}Platform independent standards@{ub}
AmigaWriter  will  be  the  first  word  processor  developed on Amiga that uses
concepts and  technologies of  standard text  systems from  other platforms. The
flexible  expandability  of  a  typical  Amiga  application will also be used in
AmigaWriter  and  allows   to  extend  the   functionality  of  it   externally.
Commercial-,  shareware- and freeware-developers will add new loaders and savers
for different text and image formats and expand AmigaWriter with features  being
superior to the standard applications on other platforms.


@{b}Ease of use@{ub}
It  will be incredibly easy  with AmigaWriter to do  easy tasks like selecting a
new font or defining  the actual screen resolution.  You wont have to  search in
badly  designed requesters, no big mouse movements necessary to select paragraph
formats. Working together with experienced users we worked out a superb  graphic
user interface concept that our developers implemented consequently. Things like
WYSIWYG  when editing notes - be they at  the end of the actual page, chapter or
document - will be standard, of course.


@{b}Amiga like@{ub}
The interface makes proper and consequent use of the Amiga multitasking ability.
So nearly every requester is non-modal,  that means you can leave it  open while
working  on the document  or with other  requesters and preferences windows. You
can see this especially in the  paragraph format dialog. You can set  tabulators
by typing their values into a requester or by clicking into the horizontal ruler
of the document while leaving the requester opened. Not everywhere you will have
both  ways at  the same  time. Fast  loading and  saving of  documents also is a
feature that is mostly only seen on Amiga.


@{b}Full paragraph control@{ub}
The paragraph requester will satisfy (nearly) all your wishes. Special  features
are:  Connected  chapter  and  page  format  and  huge  amount of options to set
tabulators. You can create a paragraph  format and set a chapter format  for it.
That eases formatting of floating text greatly. By applying the paragraph format
you  can not only change  font settings and text  alignment but also the look of
the actual chapter. There is no easier automation than this one.

@{b}Page formats and chapter management@{ub}
With AmigaWriter you can create more than  one page format - a feature not  seen
on  many word processors. A  page format can even  be linked to a paragraph. You
can  use  this  for  the  chapters  of  a  book to set different layout and text
formatting  options for them. You can set  a page format in the paragraph format
for beginning a chapter that can be different from the page format used for  the
list of contents.


@{b}Open for different image formats@{ub}
Embedding  and  printing  graphics  is  no  longer  a  unique feature of desktop
publishing programs, too. AmigaWriter uses  a flexible import interface. It  can
load  graphics in the IFF and  JPEG formats. But it is  also able to use AmigaOS
datatypes. So you can place pictures of the most exotic format in the text.
You will  get used  to AmigaWriter  immediately! You  can learn  to use  it very
easily.  When you are used  to work with other  word processors you will have no
problems at all.
