@{b}SuperView Productivity Suite II@{ub}
The extended Graphics Toolkit for Amiga 68k and PPC
http://www.schatztruhe.de
@{JLEFT}

SuperView  IV (SViewIV) reads, writes and/or  converts more than 50 graphic file
formats and seamlessy integrates external program packages like Xpk, Ghostscript
or MetaView. Thus  besides displaying of  graphics on over  20 supported graphic
cards  (via CyberGraphX,  Picasso96 or  special driver  systems) the  program is
designed for working with almost any kind of image file format, including  basic
image processing capabilities (more than 30 operators).

An  unbeatable  price/performance  ratio  for  the  SView  Productivity Suite II
results out of the already included PPC-Modules for SViewIV delivering  enormous
speed  increases, as well  as through the  also included 680x0 and PPC-optimized
AmigaOS 3 Datatypes for JPEG (JFIF), PNG and TIFF, that additionally allow other
applications to profit  from the unexpected  new speed dimensions.  Additionally
there's a MPEG-Player (PPC support, akMPEG) plus the NAIL datatype.
