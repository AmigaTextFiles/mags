@{BG fill}@{FG shine}  About fxPAINT@{FG text}@{BG back}
  fxPAINT is the first and only image-processing-software
  for the AMIGA, that makes consequent use of the AMIGA-
  hardware and available extensions (especially PPC-boards).
  That`s why fxPAINT offers you a great functionality and
  flexibility.

  It combines several types of programs and is much more
  than just a traditional painting-package (though it does
  that job, too). You can organise, convert, view your
  pictures, create HTML-overviews or print them. Scan them,
  digitize them, create them .. need a fractal graphic, fire
  or screenshots ? No problem! fxPAINT can even be used as a
  workbench-enhancement!

  No matter whether you are a graphics specialist or a now-and-
  then user, you will be fascinated by the speed, workflow and
  extended abilities of fxPAINT.
