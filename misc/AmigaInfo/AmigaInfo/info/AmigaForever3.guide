Amiga Forever is the all-in-one Amiga emulation and connectivity environment for
PCs, officially licensed by Amiga International.

We  are pleased to announce  the release of Amiga  Forever 3.0. This new version
includes version 3.1 of the Amiga ROM and OS files and AGA support under WinUAE.
Additional preinstalled programs and features, like for example Personal  Paint,
TurboText,  drag-and-drop LhA  de-archiving and  the ToolManager  dock have been
updated. This version additionally includes an archive with a new,  ready-to-run
PowerMac version.

@{b}Amiga Forever 3.0 - Overview@{ub}

Amiga  Forever contains state of the art  software to satisfy two major needs of
many Amiga  users: to  share data  between Amiga  and other  systems, and to use
their  existing  Amiga  software  and  data on non-Amiga hardware. Additionally,
software, tutorial and reference files which are likely to be of interest to any
Amiga enthusiast are included with the CD-ROM.

@{b}Amiga Forever 3.0 includes:@{ub}

Officially licensed Amiga  ROM and OS  files, versions 1.3  and 3.1. The  CD-ROM
includes  additional  versions  of  historical  interest  (all  generic versions
between 1.0 and 3.1 that have been officially released ).
Amiga Explorer 3.02 networking software, which allows you to connect an Amiga to
one or more PCs, and access  Amiga files (including virtual ADF and  ROM files),
directories  and volumes  directly from  the Windows  Desktop. Amiga Explorer is
easy  to  install  and  configure  and  includes direct support for serial (null
modem) cable connections, as well as TCP/IP.
Exclusive  interview with  Jay Miner,  "Father of  the Amiga", on topics ranging
from the birth of the Amiga to computers and society in form of an audio  track.
UAE  Amiga emulator for  Windows ("WinUAE"). All  emulation support files (Amiga
ROM and OS, Cloanto Amiga software, Picasso 96 drivers, etc.) can easily be used
by other  implementations (DOS,  Linux, Be,  Next, etc.)  of these emulators, as
well  as by future new  versions. On the CD-ROM  version the Fellow emulator for
DOS and experimental versions of UAE for PowerPC Amiga and PowerMac systems  are
also  included.  Source  code  for  the  emulation software (including the Linux
version of UAE) is included in the "Archives" directory of the CD-ROM.
Picasso 96 drivers  for the emulation  software, supporting palette  modes up to
256 colors, as well as true color.
Cloanto  Personal Paint  7.1b (paint,  animation and  image processing software,
with  short  tutorials),  DirDiff  5.1  (file  synchronization  and  replication
software),  AmiToRTF 4.2  (to convert  texts from  Amiga to Windows formats) and
MailBX to  convert Amiga  mail archives  to Microsoft  Mail, Outlook Express and
Exchange  Server. A copy of these programs  is installed in a directory which is
easily accessible from "real" Amiga systems.
Bonus software  by third  parties, such  as the  TurboText editor  (an exclusive
version  with the latest patches), KingCON,  archiving and extraction tools, all
preinstalled   for   easy   drag-and-drop   functionality   with    ToolManager.
Documentation for this software is available from the Amiga (emulation) side.
Tutorials  and  FAQs  on  data  sharing,  emulation, floppy disks, serial links,
TCP/IP, UAE, Fellow and much more.
The CD-ROM is a multi-platform CD (ISO, Rock-Ridge Amiga, Joliet and Audio). The
Macintosh   files,   which   contain   a   ready-to-run  (experimental) PowerMac
configuration, are contained in a StuffIt archive.

@{b}Supported Platforms@{ub}

The  Amiga emulation software  comes preinstalled and  preconfigured for Windows
and DOS  on Intel  platforms. The  Amiga ROM  and OS  files can  be used  by any
implementation  of the  Amiga emulators,  including for  example Unix/Linux (UAE
comes  with  source  code),  Be,  PowerMac,  etc. These emulators are constantly
updated, and can be downloaded from the Internet.

The  emulation software  included with  Amiga Forever  does not require a "real"
Amiga. On Windows systems, the emulation can be either installed or run directly
from CD (without installation). The ready-to-run (experimental) PowerMac version
is  included  in  a  StuffIt  archive,  from  where  it  can be extracted to the
Macintosh hard disk.

@{b}Amiga Explorer and Documentation@{ub}

The  Amiga Explorer software,  the automatic program  launcher and the automatic
installation software are specifically designed for Windows. The Amiga  Explorer
networking software is independent from the emulation part, and can be installed
separately.

The  Amiga software and  documentation included in  Amiga Forever are completely
independent from both  the networking and  the emulation components,  and can be
accessed  on an  Amiga computer,  or from  the emulation  environment. The Amiga
software and documentation are also preinstalled in the Amiga Forever  emulation
environment.

The main Amiga Forever documentation is in HTML format, and can be read with any
web  browser. The Amiga-specific  documentation is in  AmigaGuide format, and in
part also in HTML.

The main documentation is in English. The documentation of Personal Paint is  in
English, German and Italian. Some Amiga emulation tutorials by third parties are
in  German, French,  Polish and  Italian. The  Amiga ROM  and OS  files on Amiga
Forever include localizations in all languages supported by the Amiga OS.
