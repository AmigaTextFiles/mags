you choose from a selection of missions to practice with.
9) Full Campaign launches you into the saga of "D'Yammen's Reign". The
storyline changes as you win or lose each battle, so each campaign can

11) Choose your allegiance. Play the good guys (Confeds) and defeat
Gyan. Play the bad guys (DYammens) and wipe out the wretched Confeds.
Play the Rogue Trader and sneak around during battles, only emerging
from cloak long enough to vapourise a ship and collect it`s debris for
cash.
12) Save your Full Campaign progress and come back later to play
previously unflown missions from the current campaign.
13) Play Star Fighter Arcade; wave after wave of enemy ships attempt to
destroy your cruisers.
