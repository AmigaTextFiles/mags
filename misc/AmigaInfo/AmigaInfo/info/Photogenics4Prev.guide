Features@{ub}

Paul  Nolan is  proud to  announce Photogenics  4.0, a  complete rewrite  of the
original Photogenics, and the culmination of over four years of development.

Photogenics is a graphics/art package. It allows you to create stunning  images,
either  from  scratch  or  by  modifying  existing  images. It can be used for a
multitude  of  purposes,  from   simple  file  conversion,  to   advanced  photo
manipulation and re-touching. It also offers extremely realistic and easy to use
media such as pencils, chalk and watercolours to create stunning masterpieces in
minutes.

Photogenics  is based on innovation. At its  core, it works on images unlike any
other product. Nothing you draw is permanent, it can be rubbed out as easily  as
it  was drawn, and tweaked to perfection.  This freedom allows you to experiment
to a level never before seen.

@{b}Photogenics 4.0 features:@{ub}

*  Unparalleled  levels  of  creativity  from  being  able to modify the colour,
transparency,  image processing  mode, and  even the  position of  what you have
drawn, all in real time!
* Realistic Media  tools such as  Airbrush, Chalk, Pencil,  Sponge, Watercolour,
Smudge and Smear.
* Designed to look and feel good using just a standard mouse.
*  Paint-on Image Processing allows the user  to apply effects simply by drawing
with any  of the  media tools.  Being able  to just  airbrush everything on (and
off!) allows instant touch ups without the need for tedious masking. Paint modes
available  include  AddColour,  Adjust (Brightness/Contrast/Red/Green/Blue), Bas
Relief, BiColour, Blur, Burn,  BurnThru, Clone, ColourToGrey, Convolve,  Darken,
DifferenceRGB,  DisplaceMap, Dodge, EdgeDetect, Emboss, FlipX, FlipY, Hardlight,
Lighten,  Min,  Max,  MotionBlur,  Multiply,  Negative, Overlay, Paint, PanBlur,
Pixelize,   Posterize,  RadialBlur,  Roll,   RubPaint,  RubThru,  Screen,  Fire,
Solarize, Softlight, SubtractColour, and Tint.
* Exclusive  Paint Layer  technology allows  mistakes to  be rubbed  out without
having to redo the good parts, simply by fading out with the right mouse button.
* Undo/Redo system allows you to go back as far as you specify, so that you have
the power of both undo styles.
*  Unlimited number  of easy  to use  layers allows  fast image  composition and
amazing possibilities.
*   Stunning   Paint-On   Pyrotechnics   such   as   lens-flares,   fire,    and
explosions.Combine  with smear  to produce  supernovas, waves  of fire, and even
sunsets and waterfalls.
* Innovative clutter free user interface (font sensitive and user scaleable).GUI
components can be docked/undocked, and positioned wherever you please.
* Fully multi-threaded  - you'll never  be kept waiting  as Photogenics responds
instantly to your requests even while operations are in progress.
*  Advanced yet still easy to use Alpha channel support. Use any open image as a
mask, or simply paint one straight on to the image. Updates to the Alpha channel
such as brush strokes are reflected on the main image in real time.
* 24bit  Alpha channels.  Only Photogenics  lets you  use colour Alpha channels,
which enable you to independently mask each of the red green and blue
channels.Paint  on the  Alpha with  red, and  this lets  the red  component show
through, paint on with yellow, and both the red and green channels are  updated.
Painting  with shades of grey produce  masking as normal. Create awesome effects
by  loading  in  a  24bit  Alpha  channel  and using it to mask image-processing
effects.
*  Text Tool - finally you can just drag a box where you want the text, and type
it straight onto  any paint layer.  Supports bitmapped and  scalable fonts, with
antialiasing.
* Multiple Views  allows you to have as many views of an image as you like, each
with its own magnification.
* Impressive colour selection facilities, with five colour choosers, RGB and HSV
sliders,  and support for  256 colour swatches.  You can also  pick colours from
Images, with changes updating in real time.
*  Extensive  file  format  support.  Current  list  includes loading and saving
IFF-ILBM, IFF-DEEP, JPEG, Targa, TIFF, BMP, PNG, with more to follow.Photogenics
also supports loading with 24bit DataTypes.
* 24bit Printing support via StudioPrint.
*  Open Architecture  - Photogenics  is effectively  just one  big collection of
plug-ins that blends seamlessly to form one program. Third party developers  can
have  access to the same API as  Photogenics does, allowing developers to extend
the core software to an amazing degree.
