E'  passato circa un anno dalla  pubblicazione dell'ultima avventura grafica per
Amiga:  @{" The Big Red Adventure " link "Recensioni/TheBigRedAdventure.guide/TheBigRedAdventure" },  ora  grazie  ai  programmatori italiani della
CineTECH  e alla EPIC è finalmente disponibile una nuova avventura grafica. Dopo
le pubblicazioni delle  versioni tedesche e  inglesi su floppy  e CD finalmente,
quando  ormai  le  mie  speranze  erano  diventate  esili, è stata rilasciata la
versione italiana  su floppy  disk (grazie  alla A.T.O.)  di questa interessante
avventura.

La  confezione di cartone contiene 10 floppy disk conteneti il gioco in italiano
e un piccolo taccuino dove sono  riportate le istruzioni del gioco in  inglese e
in  tedesco (hargh!), sono presenti  per ogni lingua circa  24 pagine, 13 per le
istruzioni  e   le  restanti   per  prendere   gli  appunti   (come  ogni  bravo
investigatore),  il taccuino  è abbastanza  piccolo e  anche le  istruzioni sono
scritte utilizzando  un font  molto piccolo,  tutto sommato  avrei preferito  un
manuale tradizionale o un taccuino decisamente più grande.

Il  gioco richiede  per funzionare  il chipset  AGA, non supporta nessuna scheda
grafica, per  le versioni  su CD  (solo in  inglese o  tedesco) sono richiesti 4
megabytes di ram.

Una  volta installato il  gioco sul nostro  hard disk, verranno  occupati ben 17
megabytes. Nel cassetto del gioco sono presenti 2 icone: QuickStart per iniziare
subito il gioco e SixthSense mostra l'introduzione al gioco.

Nel gioco impersonate un investigatore che insieme al suo amico Benjamin, dotato
di  capacità  psichiche  dovranno  risolvere  i  vari  bizzarri  problemi che si
presenteranno.

La  struttura del gioco ricorda quelli della Lucas Art, pertanto la struttura di
controllo dei personaggi non presenta nessun problema.

Tutto il  gioco è  basato su  battute e  situazioni umoristiche  e bizzarre,  la
grafica  a 256  colori è  ben realizzata  (anche se  non raggiunge  alti livelli
qualitativi) e molto particolare, ricorda lo stile grafico dell'avventura  della
Lucas SAM & MAX (mai pubblicata su Amiga).

Le  musichette e gli effetti  speciali sono buoni, così  come la giocabilità, la
difficoltà è abbastanza elevata, gli autori  dichiarano che se si è in  possesso
della soluzione completa, ci vogliono circa 10 ore per risolvere il gioco !!!!!

Particolari  problemi durante  il gioco  non ne  ho riscontrati,  tranne qualche
sporadica parola non tradotta in italiano.
E' leggermente  fastidioso il  caricamento quando  si passa  da una locazione ad
un'altra  (appare sullo schermo la scritta  loading), con un buon utilizzo della
memoria aggiuntiva, le varie scene si potevano caricare una sola volta.
Peccato per il mancato utilizzo delle schede grafiche, limitando l'utilizzo  del
gioco ai soli possessori di macchine AGA.

In  conclusione c'è poco da dire, il  gioco è bello, ben realizzato, in italiano
(tranne il  manuale), le  alternative non  ci sono  (almeno che  non giochiate a
qualche vecchia avventura).

Consigliato senza dubbi a tutti gli avventurieri Amighisti.

 "Sixth Sense Investigations"
 ============================

 Product informations


1. Short game presentation
   -----------------------

"Sixth  sense investigations" is  a new large  adventure for the  Amiga range of
computers , in the classic LucasArts style.
The base storyboard tells of a  quite crazy, but very calm, sensitive  young guy
who has the paranormal feature of being able to communicate with the spirit of a
sarcastic dead man.
A friend, who defines himself as a detective, profits of him by using his skills
to  solve the most  bizarre problems of  the rich people   ... naturally only if
well paid.
The poor control that  the detective has over  the sensitive guy, and  that this
one has over the spirit, generates many crazy, funny situations which don't help
them making many money from their particoular activity ...


2. Game specs and features
   -----------------------

Game title : "Sixth sense investigations"

Game type  : Graphic adventure (LucasArts style).

Game style : Comedy; humor, gags, crazy situations and very funny
             dialogues are the base of the game.

Time collocation : Modern-age ambientation (divised in 3 dimensions)

Requirements : Amiga AGA, 2MB, 68020

Game graphic style : Hand drawn and cartoon-like.

Game  structure and size :  The whole game counts  29 locations, 22 music tracks
and various  sound effects,  28 characters  to interact  with, 340  objects, 279
animations  (non including the main characters  ones !), 24 dialogues, Over 3200
Samples and really many many enigmas.

The lenght and  difficulty level have  been set to  high values, especially  the
difficulty  as we would like the people to play a lot this game, not just buy it
and complete it  in 4 days.  About the lenght,  we're proud to  say that we need
about  8 hours to  complete it :  off course with  full solution :).  We guess a
player with solution in his hands should need about 10 hours.

Particoular features :

We've put lots  of effort in  implementing a confortable  GUI, to allow  players
playing intuitively, and MOST important, FAST : we didn't like that the majority
of  adventures forced  the player  to long  waiting while  the hero  was walking
around, or because he didn't find his way through the room, or because he didn't
understood where the player wanted him to go, or because of the very slow  mouse
reply,  that force playwer to wait eafter  each click almost a second before the
words appeard  on the  status bar.  In Sixth  Sense everything  goes quickly and
smoothly, especially mosue handling, for players to have maximum comfort.
Clicking  right mouse button on objects  performs automatically the most obvious
action, so the player often can spare to move the pointer to the parser and back
to the object just to examine  it. Saving goes fast and unlimited  savegames are
allowed,  for most "defensive" style of playing ("let's go sure, let's save now"
is a motto of lots of players).

Details of  non-important objects  have also  covered considerable  importance :
there  are douzens of  objects in the  game that have  no real use  (ie : aren't
needed to complete the game), but have been implemented with lots of detail, and
the player can do often more actions on every single of them. An example is  the
DNA-test-tube  in the laboratory  : try giving  it to doc,  and he'll tell you a
strange theory about playboy girls ;-)

But the point where most effort has been put is the logic structure : we've lots
and lots of enigmas, but they mustn't  be solved seqeuntialy : most of time  the
player has 3-4 engimas to be solved at the same time, before going definitely in
another part of the game. Often he can walk 7-8 locations without being blocked.
Other  than these "parallel enigmas", many "crossed  enigmas" have been put : to
solve one of them U must solve two subenigmas, in the sequence you prefer,  then
you  come to a  middle point, then  you can sovle  another two subenigmas in the
sequence  you  prefer.  Combining  crossed  and  parallel enigma structures, and
merging  the players ideas spreading them on the three worlds (each one with its
own way-of-thinking), gives as result a considerable freedom, reduces the moment
where the player feels  "blocked" ("I really can  find no way outta  here, let's
look  in solutions ...", that's a sentence  noone should ever say playing a good
balanced adventure) and helps discovering new details at each playing-session.


3. Introduction to the game's storyboard and structure
   ---------------------------------------------------

After the introduction (that shows one  of the numerous failed attempts to  make
money  through investigations), our  heroes will suddenly  fall in deep troubles
while trying to solve a case based on strange explosions and robots appearing in
a cheese store.
From this  event on,  the situation  gets worse  and worse;  Ben is kidnapped by
unknown entities, awakes in a jail and will discover that he's now in a parallel
robotic  dimension. Frank will try to understand what happens, and, with help of
a friend scientist, will manage  to accomplish an interdimensional jump,  trying
to appear in the robotic dimension to save Ben.
As we all may expect, something goes wrong, and Frank appears in a forest, which
really doesn't look as belonging to a robotic dimension !
As  a matter of fact Frank is now  lost in the Toon dimension, populated by lots
of unemployed animals.
From now on the whole game develops on  the three worlds at the same time :  the
player  will control both Frank and Ben  alternatively, and the scene will often
swap between the three dimensions, as also many enigmas need interaction between
the three to be successfully solved.
A depressed lover robot, a thief pig,  an hysterical rich woman will be some  of
our heroes important meetings in the three dimensions.
This pretty complex situation makes the game interesting, filled with unexpected
events and pretty hard to be solved.
Naturally  all this dramatic sequence of events  is presented to the player in a
comedy form, with a global atmosphear of humor and crazy logic.


 The three dimansions are :

 - Earth dimension : normal city environment, featuring DOTT like gfx, very bent
lines, smooth colors and nonproportional perspective. Merry music.

 - Robotic dimension : high tech environment, filled with robots, no wood and no
humans here; high pollution and disorder.
   Hand-drawn  gfx,  but  with  dark,  metallic  colors,  much less smooth&sweet
approach than in the other two worlds.
   The robotic dimension has been conquered by the mysterious Emperor Paltrytine
who is bored because in mastering robots he finds no
   excitement.  He has  decided to  construct a  large access to parallel worlds
with the aim of having
   fun for some years with new types  of wars (this is his only hobby).  The big
obstacle to this funny
   project  is the  low level  of resources  in his  dimension, so  he's able to
create only little
   interdimensional tunnels. Paltrytine  is now sending  small groups of  robots
through these tunnels
   with the aim of stealing the raw material necessary to conquer the universe!
   Of course, lucky as we are, Earth is one of the first dimensions that were
   chosen to be conquered by the great Emperor ...

 Other than trying to come back to Earth, our heroes should also do something
 against Paltrytine!

 -  Toon dimension      :  very simple  cartoon gfx  (simplier as  Earth world),
similar to Warner-Bros cartoons. Perspective is more normal than earth one,
   but lines are very rounded, and surfaces are more uniform (like cartoons).
   Peaceful small town environment; strong unemployement; only animals live here
(ie : the characters are animals).
   Frank will  arrive on  the Toons  dimension and,  to be  more precise, in the
Toons galaxy, on the Toons planet of the Toons sun system.
   The  planet is very little  (50 km diameter) but  the gravity of the place is
equal to the terrestrial one.
   This is the craziest dimension, logic is a premium, and the player will have
   to fight to make his way through the though enigmas we've prepared. As
   a mater of fact this is the last (chronologicaly) accessed dimension, and
   features situations where 4-5 engimas have been encapsulated and crossed
   toghter, allowing the player to solve them in a free sequence.


4. Vega introduction
   -----------------

"Sixth sense investigations" has been developed using Vega, our attempt to reply
to the lack of adventure-games for Amiga.
Vega  is  an  adventures  conversion/development  system  that could allow us to
convert many PC adventures out in the market today (Day of the Tentacle, Hand of
Fate, and so on) in a short time and with good technical results (see below).
Naturally  also the creation  of many quality  new games is  made much easier by
Vega.

The Vega graphic  adventures developing system  is composed by  many indipendent
editors  and  compilers  (which  generate  various  kinds of datafiles) and by a
unique  player  that  generates  the  adventures  from  the  informations in the
datafiles.
It's  very important to notice that Vega has  not just being used to develop the
game, but it has been completely programmed by us.

By its structure and  nature, Vega is, at  least ATM, an internal-usage  package
(here  I mean that we'll use it to create graphic adventures, but, ATM, we won't
release it as "authoring system").
As indication of some of Vega's capabilities :

 - Scrolling, main character and mouse pointer at 50 fps.

 - Every background animation can have a frequence between 1 and 50 fps.

 - Zoom of main character and of any external one.

 - Automatic search of the route between two points, this ensures a good
   playability, as the hero always goes where the player wants him to go, even
   in complex locations.

 - Complex objects control (objects changing many times in many different
   locations), super fast mouse answer, LucasArts alike dialogues.

 - Runs on any unexpanded A1200.

 - 256 colors playing area, with various sizes.

 - Demo scenes.

 - Multiple main characters control (switching system).

 - Very fast loading/saving.

 - Sound effects and voice support

 - Comfortable game's user interface, including dialogues, multi-shape mouse
   pointer, mouse shortcuts, for an easy, intuitive, fast and efficent game
   control.

With  Vega  we  would  like  to  create&convert  many adventures for our beloved
machine.
Naturally  all  will  depend  from  the  success  our  first title ("Sixth sense
investigations") meets, we
really hope you like it !
