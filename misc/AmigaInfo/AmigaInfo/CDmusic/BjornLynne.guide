            @{b}Ordering LYNNE/Dr.Awesome CD's@{ub}

 
Ordering CDs by mail order 

If you are unable to order CDs by the online order form using a credit card,
here are some alternative ways to order CDs by Bjorn Lynne. All orders are
handled within 2 days of receiving the payment, and all CDs are shipped with
first class air mail. 

Ordering from USA:  

You can send me 20 US$ in cash, for each CD you want, to the address below. I
can also accept an International Money Order, but this must be written out in UK
pounds (14 UK pounds per CD, incl. shipping) and made payable to Bjorn Lynne.
Please note, I cannot use U.S. checks or U.S. Postal Money Orders. 

Ordering from UK:  

You can send me a normal british cheque for 13 pounds for each CD (includes
p&p). Make the cheque out to BJORN LYNNE and send it to the address below. 

@{b}Ordering from Europe outside UK:@{ub}  

You can send me a EuroChequefor 14 UK pounds for each CD (includes p&p). Do not
write the EuroCheque out in any other currency than UK pounds. Make the
EuroCheque payable to BJORN LYNNE, and also write your account number on the
back of the cheque.  

Ordering from Norway:  

You can place 150 Norwegian Kroner(includes postage & packing) for each CD into
my Norwegian post giro account no. 0533.0681472. Keep the receipt (!) and send
it (or a copy of it) to me at the address below. The receipt is your proof of
payment. I will send the CD(s) within 48 hours after I receive the post giro
receipt.For faster processing, you may also fax me the copy of the post giro
receipt, rather than sending it. The fax number is +44 1924 267 658, and write
"TO BJORN" on the fax. I also have a Norwegian bank account; the account number
is 6222.10.78352. The same instructions apply, as with the post giro. Send me a
copy of the receipt, and I'll send you the CD right away.  

Ordering from Sweden:  

You can place 160 Swedish Kronor(includes postage & packing) for each CD into my
Norwegian post giro account no. 0533.0681472. All the post offices in
Scandinavia have a co-operation thing going, which lets you go into any post
office in Sweden and pay money into my Norwegian post giro account. You have to
specify to the person at the post office, though, that you are placing money
into a Norwegian account; otherwise he/she will just tap in the account number
as a normal Swedish account, and it will just come out as "error". Also, you
must add 35 Swedish Kronor to the total order amount, because this amount will
be subtracted from my account when the money comes in, to pay for the foreign
processing. Keep the receipt (!) and send it (or a copy of it) to me at the
address below. The receipt is your proof of payment. I will send the CD(s)
within 48 hours after I receive the post giro receipt. For faster processing,
you may also fax me the copy of the post giro receipt, rather than sending it.
The fax number is +44 1924 267 658, and write "TO BJORN" on the fax.
