</B></FONT> (31-Aug-97

<UL>In reply to accusations by Amiga Review who said they closed due
to AF and CU not printing their addvertisements, Andrew Korn of CU
Amiga Magazine replies that this was not the real reason. Besides
that, <CITE>a full professional magazine does not get advertising
in their rivals, although a fanzine does</CITE>. Apparently the
decision to not carry advertisements was not very easy, but in the
end the <CITE>word came from above</CITE>. On a different subject,
he mentions that over the last couple of years, readership of Amiga
magazines gas dropped 22-28% every 6 months.

any money on their own in the port, and when they noticed that the
product was too bad (buggy) and not sold enough (too expensive) they
didn't have any regrets leaving the Amiga platform; not without

<UL>Philipp Boerker points out that all Motorola chips are manufactured
using one single process and are only assigned a MHz rating after

may be an explanation why some 060s get extremely hot while others don't.
If there where no flaws during manufacturing, the chip may be overclocked
by up to 100%, but there is no way to find out the quality of the
manufacturing of a 060 and therefore it is not suggested to overclock
the chips.

<UL>Dave Haynie says in 1991 he was developing a new overall system architecture
for the Amiga, code-named &quot;Acutiator&quot;. It was a highly modular architecture,
with each piece indepently replacable, a CPU-independent motherboard and a new
inter-module bus called AMI bus (Amiga Modular Interconnect). The AMI bus
was supposed to be small (few pins), fast (100 MB/s) and auto-configuring.
In 1992 PCI was announced, which was basically better in every area than the
AMI bus, but in addition it was also backed by half the industry. By the fall
of '93, Commodore was too broke to spend much money on AAA or Hombre.
<CITE>The PIOS One is basically what happens when you try to build an
Acutiator type system entirely from off-the-shelf parts.</CITE>

</B></FONT> (19-Aug-97
)</P>
<UL>Timothy Rue forwards what seems like a Czech posting that includes
an English message from the ICOA Transitional Steering Committee.
The message says it is not an official release, but confirms a lot
of the recent rumours about Gateway. The TSC has been in contact
with Jeff Schindler; the TSC was invited to Gateway2000 for a meeting;
Gateway has been in contact with OEMs wishing to <CITE>leverage
current and future Amiga technology</CITE> - apparently some very
big names in consumer electronics industry; Jeff will do R&amp;D while
Petro will do marketing; GW have already hired support and admin stuff
but no techs yet; they have rented a separate building to house the Amiga
employees; they want to make money on the Amiga and invest in any area
that can bring a profit; Jason Compton is going up for a separate meeting.
Timothy Rue then forwards a mail apparently written by Carl Sassenrath
to Petr Krenzelok that says it is an email message <CITE>directly from REBOL</CITE>.
[although this could be a fake, invented by Timothy]

A magic command, &quot;DOIT&quot; will do whatever you can imagine.
Myron's concept is already finished, except that the hardware
needs to be developed (because he is no hardware guy) and the

A: Gateway has never had plans to sell Amigas in the US despite its

Instead Gateway was interested in securing the rights to much of the

<UL>In a discussion between Timothy Rue and George Noel can be found
what seems the origin of the many discussions and controversies about
Tim's posts. Tim seems to think that his own postings and web site
inspired the ICOA movement, but feels that now he doesn't get enough
credit. George Noel says it is false that Tim was an inspiration and
besides that Tim's ideas were meant to be &quot;Freeware&quot; too, so that he
wouldn't have got more than recognition for coming up with the idea anyway.
George suggests that Tim should, instead of constantly complaining, get
something done and come back when his own initiative is ready.
