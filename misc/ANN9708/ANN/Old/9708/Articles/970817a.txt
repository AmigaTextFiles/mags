I shall tell you, my A2000's memory/accelerator card died late last
year. At the time I had a lot of work lined up and the breakdown was a
major disaster. To effect a repair I needed to find a board that would
speed things up (no point in spending the dosh otherwise) and allow me
to install 72 pin simms.

White Knight were advertising such a card, I ordered and paid for it by
credit card. (£465) 11 weeks later the card still had not arrived and I
was told by White Knight that they still could not give me a firm
delivery date.

I was not a happy chappie and had always reviled PC's - but I had work
to do so...

I cancelled my order and proceeded to build myself a Pentium system with
the cash. In all I spent £613 bulding it myself. I was expecting all
kinds of problems with the new system which never surfaced. I was
expecting it to be slower than my old A2000 + 33mhz 030 but I was in for
a shock.

Within 3 days I knew that I should never have listened to those who said
PC's are crap. I was suddenly able to complete far more work in a day
than ever before. I was very pleased.

After a while I came into this group and said so, simply because I
wished to allay the fears of anyone who, due to work pressures might be
considering the change of platform and was worried about it. I wanted to
let them that it was really easy to switch over and not an arduous task.

Everything I said was from my own point of view - I changed platforms,
it was easy, and my work throughput increased due to the ease of use of
the new system.

For commiting such heresy I was given very short shrift and a lot of
abuse - yet the facts remained the same, my new system improved my
working life and I am very glad I made the change, even though I dreaded
it at the time due to some of the things I had heard about PC's in this
group.


Some people cannot handle the fact that I am pleased with my new system.
Their problem not mine.

Anyone who does have to change platforms should not be put off. The
Amiga gives you a god grounding for modern PC's.

Got to go - I'm packing for my holidays. (a week in the sun)


All the best
Harry
