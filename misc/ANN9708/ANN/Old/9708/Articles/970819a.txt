Tak pro vsechny amigisty, kteri si mysli, ze se prestalo cokoliv dit,
mam tady jeden mail z ICOA od Fleecyho Mosse, vedouciho projektu. Rad
bych upozornil na to, abyste nedelali rozruch a rozhodne pockali, co z
toho vyleze a neptali se treba osobne dane osoby na dalsi podrobnosti,
please, abych treba nebyl vykicknut z mailing listu.

TSC = Transitional steering committee, rada 5 osob reprezentujicich
momentalne ICOA:

Alain Penders (Finale-Dev)
Andy Finkel (Pios)
Dean Brown (DKB)
fleecy moss (JMS)
Jesse McClusky (Boeing)

Dix,

Petr Krenzelok, Amiga Review (CZ), REBOL contribution developer :-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The TSC has been authorised to say the following BUT if
the TSC is asked directly it will deny everything 8-)

GW/AI have yet to formalise their PR relationships and find
themselves in an awkward situation. They want the community
to know what is going on BUT do not want it appearing publicly
on the web - this can be discussed in the community but DOES NOT
constitute an official release - the TSC has already voiced its
concerns in adopting this policy but GW/AI are calling the shots
so bear with it for now 8-)



1 - The TSC has been in contact with the new head of R&D, Jeff
Schindler (check the GW2K site for details). Straight out of
college he sold Vics and C64s (bow down and pray) for 4 years
before he became a HW engineer. He was the head of the Destination
project, GW's most innovative product to date. The TSC has found
him very open to ideas and suggestions.

2 - He has invited, at GW expense, the whole TSC up for this coming
sunday, monday and tuesday to discuss the role the ICOA can play, what
it will take to get the ICOA started, OASYS, the Amiga and whatever
else we can talk about. They will reveal their plans to us but we
will have to sign NDAs 8-(((((((((

3 - Gateway has had many contacts with OEMs wishing to leverage current
and future Amiga technology, including some very, VERY big names in
the consumer electronics industry

4 - Jeff will deal with the R&D side and Petro will deal with the
marketing (to start with)

5 - GW have already hired support and admin staff but no techs yet

6 - They have rented a completely separate building to house the Amiga
employees

7 - They want to make money on the Amiga - they will put money into
any area that they feel can see them turn a profit

8 - Jason Compton is going up for a separate meeting about the
GW PR strategies - he has NOTHING to do with the ICOA and will not
be present at our meetings (unless we request it)



Jeff wants the community to know that they are working hard, and
judging by the replies the TSC gets when we phone, he is rushing
all over the building arranging stuff.

Please feel free to discuss this or pass it on to the community but
none of it will be officially announced, at least until after this
weekend.

Thanks for believing in the ICOA - we have a real chance!

tak tady mate neco od Sassenratha. Krome toho, ze uz rebol umi stahovat
z webu nebo ftp, atp., se zda, ze brzy na muj desktop dorazi verze,
ktera umi posila i maily. V kombinaci se silnymi strankami jazyka REBOLu
se je na co tesit ...

Zdarec,

This is just too much fun!

You are one of the first people on the planet to
receive this email message directly from REBOL.  Save
it!  This is history in the making.  Next year there
will be millions of messages sent using REBOL.

What can I say?  REBOL's new send function is awesome.
"Insanely great", an old friend would say. As is the
REBOL way, simple things are kept simple:

    send bill@msn.com "Better sell your shares soon."

And, of course you've got all the power of REBOL's
datatypes to help you generate the message content.
Just stop and imagine what that means!  The net will
never be the same.

Plus, REBOL knows about more than just email... it
will handle URL's, such as FTP, WEB, FILE, etc. Then,
where the real POWER lurks, it will be able to handle
full REBOL inter and intra system message ports.

Yes... something wonderful is about to happen... and
the world will never be the same.  Over the last few
months, great progress has been made, and there will
be even better times ahead.

Stay on the edge,

    Carl Sassenrath

    WWW.REBOL.COM


PS:

Just as easily as the example above, I could have sent
you a C source code file with a line like:

    send user@domain.com load %main.c

Or a REBOL executable program with a similar line:

    send user@domain.com load %game.r

If I had wanted a more complete mail header, the
message could have been a REBOL block or object:

    send user@domain.com [
