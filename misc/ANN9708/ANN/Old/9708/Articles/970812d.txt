Here's an interesting little snippet which I just picked up on ...
I just received an anonymous e-mail offering a little news for my
e-zine, The Lair!  I've decided to post it here, rather than in the
e-zine as, at this time, I can't confirm it - so, here goes ...

ICOA's "Temporary Steering Commitee" has been talking to Gateway
2000's new head of R&D, Jeff Schindler (see G2K's web-site) about the
Amiga and ICOA's vision for a new machine.  My source (who gives the
impression of being an insider within the ICOA) informs me that they
(the TSC) found Mr. Schindler to be "VERY open to ideas and
suggestions".

Jeff Schindler has a prior association with the Commodore of old -
straight out of school, he sold VIC and C64's (ah, fond memories flood
through my mind) for around 4 years, before becoming a hardware
engineer.  He is notable in that he headed the "Destination" project,
Gateway's most innovative project to date.

I'll post more on this, as and when I get more details, and if I can
confirm any of this.
