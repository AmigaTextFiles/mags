  MUI makes the system a CO-OPERATIVE multitasking one in that it does much
processing in the context of the input device.  When this has the CPU,
there cannot be a switch to another process, so the system locks up until
it is released.  I've noticed that this also happens with CyberGraphX when
you are outputting text/graphics to a hidden screen - the mouse locks up
for the duration of the print call.

  Yes yes, I know everyone will jump on me and say that MUI offloads it's
button processing until later, but the fact is that there is a log of stuff
done by MUI in such a way that the CPU is not able to switch contexts, for
whatever reason.  The mouse pointer will start and stop, start and stop, as
the system starts and stops as the CPU gets locked up by MUI.  Now *THIS*
friends, regardless of any elegent ways that you may explain it away, is
CO-OPERATIVE multitasking.

  The sad fact is that MUI has a fundamental design problem that needs to
be addressed in the next version.  Steffan should have written his own
dispatch routines and OOP system rather than relying on BOOPSI and it's
fundamental shortcomings.

  I don't expect my mouse pointer to lock up when IBrowse is updating a
Jpeg.  If I wanted that kind of behaviour I would buy a PC and run WinDOS
3.1!
