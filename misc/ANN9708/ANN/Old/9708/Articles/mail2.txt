What the hell are you talking about?  What is a New World Order Amiga
community?

And what exactly is your point?  Would you let me know what I have
"chosen" that upsets you?

I do know who Jay Miner is.  I do know who Carl Sassenrath is.  I do
know who Dave Haynie is...  Once again, what is your point?

I doubt that you are capable of realising what I know (and feel)
about the Amiga.

Stupid flaming does not help.  This is a service I offer to the Amiga
community, free of charge.  I invest a lot of time (and money) and
all you do is write stupid mails.  Do you know what a "constructive
criticism" is?  This mail surely isn't one.

Besides that, you don't seem to have noticed that I just summarize
and paraphrase what has been said in the newsgroup.  If possible,
I always keep my opinion out of the summaries.

All this just proves that you have completely misunderstood the
concept of my pages.

Just *think* before sending mails.  OK?
