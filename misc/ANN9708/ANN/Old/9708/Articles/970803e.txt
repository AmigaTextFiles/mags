[snip the Gateway objection letter]

Well, it's not necessarily a "scratch."  There's obviously a difference of
opinions here between Gateway and Lotus Pacific.  I called LP as soon as I
got the news from Gateway (I also called Gateway but they did not return
my call) and they felt rather differently about the situation.

It's unfortunate that the terms and details of the Gateway deal were not
disclosed since we outsiders can't look through the materials and make our
own conclusions.
