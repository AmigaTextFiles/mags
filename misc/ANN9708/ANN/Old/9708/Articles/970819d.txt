Here's the latest.....

Microsoft says it will definitely sell Blue Ribbon
software. That of course includes my fav, B&P.
I have talked with Petro T., and by his direction
sent my MS contact info to Jeff S. at Gateway.
Petro told me that he was also going to ask Jeff
about this issue personally when he was in Souix
City on Aug 11 with Jeff. I am going to ask Petro
to supply an address that all interested users or
developers can contact for info or to show support
for the return of these programs to their rightful
place with ami. I understand that a half-baked windows
version MIGHT have been part of the deal also, but i can't
confirm that yet. For now I guess you can e-mail me with
questions or comments. (Yes even those few who told me
I'd get nowhere talking to MS and hit me with a slam or two)

thanks
troy silvey
