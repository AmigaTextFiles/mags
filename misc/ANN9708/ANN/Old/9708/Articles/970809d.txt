The only thing being ported so far from the PC world to the Amiga is games
with Myst being the first one.  BUT there are other programs being ported
to PPC from the Amiga world which make the Amiga PPC transition seem
better and more professional.

The Amiga had always been known for its games so it is wise to get that
category back as it will hopefully lead to the Amiga being popular in
homes again.  Today it is considered legit for computers to be doing all
kinds of fancy stuff for games whereas back when the Amiga was the king, a
majority of the industry didn't see the need or see how the things used
for games could be put towards multimedia or business applications also.

It is true the Amiga needs some native big name software but until the
Amiga starts selling in numbers again, it just isn't going to happen
unless AI or Gateway 2000 subsidize a company to port their software.
Hopefully Java will help in this situation.
