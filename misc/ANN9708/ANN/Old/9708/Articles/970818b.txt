I saw this posted on Next Generation's web site. (They are a forward 
looking video game magazine).

Q:
Is Gateway still going to sell Amigas? 
A:
Gateway has never had plans to sell Amigas in the US despite its
purchase of the former computer superpower some months ago.
Instead Gateway was interested in securing the rights to much of the
technology behind the Amiga as well as continuing to service the
sizable European userbase with new software. Announcements
regarding new hardware even in Europe have never been made by
Gateway.

I hope we get some official news from GW soon!
