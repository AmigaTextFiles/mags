There can be several reasons for putting advertising where they.  One is to
reassure the existing community that something is still happening.  Perhaps
you, personally are immune (or unaware of) to the effect, but its common
advertising knowledge that advertisements increase the amount of customer
satisfaction among current product owners.  (Look at the car advertisement
business).

In this case, I suspect that there is another, more important reason for the
advertising...it keeps the magazines afloat.  Magazines live off advertising.
It's in Gateway's best interest that there be magazines on the newstand
promoting the Amiga.  They understand it.  Most computer mfgrs understand it;
that's why its not unknown for a magazine for new computer to be seeded by the
computer mfgr.  (or it wasn't unknown, before PC clones took over)
