You've been angry, you've been frustrated, and now your thinking about
giving up. Tired of no upgrades, lack of software, to many pirates of your
software, not enough freebees, hardware that cost to much because it's not
free or your not paid to take it, trouble getting hardware fixed, etc..

Well don't delay, join Today and let out all of your anger and
frustration.

It's the Flame Tim Fan Club. Tell him he's an idiot, tell him he's a fool,
and if he misspells a word you get to flame him for free.

To join all you need do is to simply post your most intelligent flame, or
for most of you the best you can do (but only if you use this coupon). And
don't forget to pass the word, for it's the only other requirement for you
to joining the Flame Tim Fan Club.

And here's the best part, it's what you get in return, a way to release
all the anger and frustration that your beloved Amiga has caused you. You
know Amiga does mean girl friend, and you know how women can be, so
instead of hitting your Amiga and being charged with computercide, just
flame Tim.

What could be better than flaming someone who has been screwed in all he
has tried to do with the Amiga. All the money he has spent to further the
Amiga but failed because Commodore did too. The 300 bucks he got cheated
out of for helping a down under shop obtain some 68040 CPUs. And there is
much more. Just think it's the best way to boost your own ego and make
yourself feel important, so jump on the band wagon where so many already
are. It's really the only real team work happening today on the Amiga so
don't be a wimp, flame Tim today. Don't be honest, don't be fair, just
flame Tim Today and feel the releif of your anger and frustration NOW
and without delay.

And remember to pass the word about the "FLAME TIM FAN CLUB" today!!
