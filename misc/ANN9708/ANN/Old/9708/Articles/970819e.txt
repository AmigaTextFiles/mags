This is rather inaccurate.

Gateway (or more accurately, Amiga, Inc. and related companies) 
"officially endorsing"  ICOA or any other single organization of Amiga
users or developers (take your pick, there are plenty) is not a necessary
step to properly carrying out an Amiga strategy.

Jeff Schindler is General Manager of Amiga, Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Gateway 2000 which is charged with, among other things,
Amiga R&D.  So wherever you got the idea that he is in some way
"temporary", put that out of your mind.
