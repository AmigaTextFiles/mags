Brian King (whom I met on Saturday) says that it will be finished this week.
It won't be perfect (probably full-screen only and limited to 16 bit), but
usable. Unfortunately, Tobias Abt (whom I met on Saturday, too) rejected my
plea of implementing support for graphics cards that change their specs
on the fly. :-)

Not yet. Only two out of five functions are implemented at the moment, and
there is still more custom chip stuff running than necessary when the virtual
monitor switch is pointing to the virtual gfx card.

Minor correction: It will be a Picasso96 driver, not a CyberGraphX one (the
latter being under the control of phase "let's be more proprietary than
Microsoft" 5).

Minor addition: Juergen Schober (whom I met on Saturday, too) wrote a very
interesting Intuition replacement that could become part of a native
intuition.library emulation, allowing Amiga apps to open their windows
directly on the host's desktop. And Stefan Stuntz (whom I met on Sunday)
says that he is willing to provide an Intel-native version of
muimaster.library, which could then be trivially accessed through a stub
library on the UAE side.

Although all of this is still in vapor state and I won't be able to
substantially contribute to this new branch of UAE's development, we
_may_ soon be living in a world where the PC happens to be the fastest
MUI platform of all. :-)
