Urm, graphic card support is planned for a future update - available as
an update free on Aminet and cover disks/CDs after release.

The reason I (who am usually extremely PRO gfx cards) don't really feel its a
big issue - is because this game would not benefit from a gfx card in the
slightest.

Its in 320x200/320x256 (so no dma/speed problems there), its totally 2D 
(so no C2P or any problems like that).

Its not a game that would *benefit* from a gfx card, but we will make
sure that gfx card support is added at a later date, so that
A2000 and A3000 owners who have bought a gfx card can play it.

Personally, even when the gfx card update is released - I'll still
play it on AGA - because I don't like the 'blocky' look of 
double-scanned 320x200 graphics card and dblPAL/NTSC screens.
Thats just a personal preference - some people prefer that
look.

So, to sum up - onEscapee would be no faster at all, or more
colourful or anything on graphics cards - but we will still
support them for big box non-AGA amiga owners with gfx
cards.

There you go - I think that summarises nicely :-)
