This is to correct an error that Petro pointed out to me
concerning my article.  Jeff Schindler is the Manager of
R&D, and Petro the Manager of Amiga International as I 
previously mentioned in the article.  However, Amiga 
Inc. under Jeff does not "control" Amiga International.
Petro and Jeff are "teamworkers" in running Gateway's 
Amiga efforts and both answer to Joseph Burke, VP of 
Market Development for Gateway 2000.

I have corrected my article.  Those user groups that
wish to use this article for their newsletter can,
all that I request is an email stating this.  Those
that have viewed this article are asked to consider the
correction above.
