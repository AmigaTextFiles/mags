Sorry if you already know, but apparently Guildhall Leisure have convinced
Electronics Boutique and HMV to try stocking some Amiga CD titles. They're
supposed to appear in late August, and the titles include Civilization,
F1, Theme Park, Blitz Basic and more. I suggest we should display some
interest, by phoning the local EB or HMV for details, and buying a title
when they appear, assuming you have a CD, :) The whole story is in CU Amiga
magazine. Keep the faith.
