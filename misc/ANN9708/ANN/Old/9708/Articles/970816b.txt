This is no big news.. I am sure there are plenty of other people out there
very open to ideas and suggestions also.. its not saying they are going to
be put into place.  As far as we know so far, Gateway 2000 still hasn't
officially endorsed ICOA and the Gateway representative looking after R&D
so far is only temporary until Petro hires a new one. I find it very
ignorant they are going directly to Gateway anyways, it is like trying to
solve a problem with a friend when you were younger by running to their 
mom.

And that's not really innovative when you think about it.. combining a
huge monitor with PC hardware and a TV tuner on the motherboard.
