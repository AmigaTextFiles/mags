Review folded, blaming AF and CU for refusing to carry advertising for
them. This was not the reason they closed. A full professional magazine
does not get advertising in their rivals, although a fanzine does. When
we got their offer, we had to decide which they counted as. Some of us
were for, some were against taking their advertising. In the end the
word came from above. 

:The 22nd August edition of UK Press Gazette reported that the Audit
Bureau of 
:Circulation figures from Jan to June 97 for Amiga Format 28,325 
:(a drop of 33.6 per cent year on year) and CU 27,391 (down 25.7 per
cent).

The ABC figures are accounted on a six monthly basis. The normal drop
for Amiga magazines over the last couple of years has been 22-28% every
6 months. In the last ABC results announced a week ago, AF dropped 12%,
and CU Amiga dropped a mere 2.7%, much of which can be attributed to a
major distribution problem with one issue.
