Agreed, $150 Mil is nothing. There is however an undisclosed sum
involved in this deal (rumoured to be a *very* big sum), which adds
to the suspicions that there is more to this than MS simply
investing in Apple to ward off Anti-Trust.

This deal doesnt seem to be all good for MS as far as I can see.
The stock they paid the $150 Mil for is non-voting, they get
disadvatages of buying stock (you have to pay for it) but not the
advantages (you get some control over the company).

Well, if we knew what MS was actually being forced to pay then
we might be able to judge whether the above is true or not.
