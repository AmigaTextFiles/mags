Gateway never made claim as to wanting to sell Amigas, their subsidary,
Amiga International does that.  AI has been liscensing new machines,
developing new stuff, and advertising (I saw two ads in mags so far).

I think some of the most interesting stuff for Amiga is coming
from Phase 5 and Index right now as faw as hard ware goes.  Lets
hope AI focus on software improvement.
