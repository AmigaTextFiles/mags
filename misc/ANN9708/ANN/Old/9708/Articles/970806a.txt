Hi all,

Sorry if this doesnt come out formatted quite right. I had originally emailed it
to Jason Compton for inclusion in READER MAIL in his electronic magazine but
he refused to print it in there. I have no problem with that. It's HIS
magazine which goes together mostly or wholely through HIS own effort so he
can put together things to show whatever he likes in whatever way he likes and
rule out opposing views as he likes, too. Here it is:

============================================================================


Jason,

Something for READER MAIL.


I got up early and went to that show. Fortunately for me, what I did was get
up SO early that I arrived there about 30 minutes early. So, to console
myself, I looked through the windows from the street outside which showed
every part of the show except for what one school setup inside a tent inside
the building.

What I saw was basically the same as I see, monthly, at Parramatta Town Hall
but at least at Parramatta they were honest about it. Please note I am NOT
taking into account that school's stand or anything in it as I didnt see it
so wont comment on it any further. As for the rest, it was basically a JUNK
SALE or a way to get rid of stuff still on the shelves for some people who
wanted to sell it and get SOMETHING for it. At Parramatta Town Hall where
they have the same thing for ANY platform, you KNOW it to be so and it costs
$2 to get in. At the AAG, it cost $10 to get in and see the same thing. So,
having seen it from the street then finding out it would be $10 to get in, I
asked the lady at the door why it was so MUCH. Her answers was that she didnt
know either and thought it was WAY too much to ask for entrance.

In the end, the whole thing turned out to be nothing much unless you were
actually going to buy something. A gentleman from within the show heard me
ask why so much and her reply and came out to intercede. His comment was:

"If you BUY something in here, you'll get your money back!"

Does anyone smell "Used Car Salesman" in that?

There was really nothing there that couldnt be bought at the Parramatta Town
Hall sale - an honestly marked "Computer Sale" which the AAG really was.
