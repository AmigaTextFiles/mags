    Hello everyone, I'm Michael A. Piva, creator of the great Amiga web page
"The Amiga Resistance" (http://www.ualberta.ca/~mpiva/amiga).  A while back I
came up with an idea to try and help increase the Amiga shareware market and
wrote an article for Amiga Report about it.  Initially this idea got a lot of
positive response and several people volunteered to help me with the project.
Many ideas were tossed around and several people said they would do some
things but never got around to it.  I finally managed to get a mailing list
set up for the project but most of my volunteers bailed on me because of jobs
or school.  I still believe this idea has great potential and am now looking
for new volunteers so I've decided to repost my idea to several Amiga news
groups.  Please reply to let me know if you are interested in helping with
this project.  The following is the article I wrote for Amiga Report:


========================================================================
                               ChequeMarcs

========================================================================

What in the world are ChequeMarcs?

     Well, simply put, it is an idea I came up with after reading Amiga
Report 4.13. A while back I remember thinking to myself... "Very few people
actually register shareware programs. In fact, I'm one of them. That's not
very good but I just don't have the spare money, nor do I want to put up with
the hassle of figuring out how many DM's are in a Canadian dollar or mailing
away a cheque. The fact that's I have have bad experiences in the past does
not help either. wouldn't it be nice to just TRADE programs over the
internet?"

     To clarify this... say I develop a shareware game and decide that people
can register it for $20. Later I download a game from the Aminet (written
by Bob) and I love the game, however, it's only the first level and Bob
wants $20 for me to register it. But, say Bob has played my game and really
likes it and wants to register it as well. Wouldn't it make more sense
for me to TRADE a registered version of my game for a resistered version
of his? This way, no money would be involved and it all can be done over
the internet. It would be EASY and SAFE.

     This is where ChequeMarcs come into play. Jonathan Gapen wrote an
interesting article in Amiga Report talking about shareware developers using
E-Cash. Well, let's forget regular money altogether and create ChequeMarcs.
In the above situation, what if Bob loves my game but I don't care for his?
The trading system won't work then. If Bob wants to get a registered copy of
my game, he just pays me 20CM. This 20CM now does me no good in the REAL world
but I could spend my 20CM on another shareware program. Or, I could save my
20CM and wait until someone else registers my game so now I have 40CM and
can now afford to register Fred's great new utility (which costs 35CM).

     The great thing about this system is that involves no real money and
still stimulates shareware development. After all, I'd be much more willing
to develop shareware programs for the Amiga if I knew that it would give
me credit to register some of my favorite shareware programs.


The Needs: (What do we need to start using ChequeMarcs?)

     First, we need a group of people to organize the project (I've come
     up with the general concept but I am FAR from qualified to work out all
     the tiny details myself). This is my main focus for now. If you want to
     volunteer please e-mail me at mpiva@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca

     We need to set up some sort of online bank to handle the "money"
     (and, of course, people experienced with security on the Internet
     to protect the "money" from hackers).

     Then we need to advertise ChequeMarcs to the Amiga shareware developers,
     convincing them of the benefits of using such a system. Note to
     developers: I'm not asking you to ask for ChequeMarcs instead of
     regular money but use them as an alternative.


The Problems:

     ChequeMarcs, like all innovative ideas, are not perfect right from the
start. There are some obvious problems with my idea. Some of these problems
include: if there aren't any ChequeMarcs in existence right now, where will
they come from. If you earn ChequeMarcs by people registering your programs,
how do you earn ChequeMarcs if you're not a developer. I am aware of such
problems but I believe the idea is still a good one and these problems can be
solved. I already have a few ideas to solve some of the problems but I would
rather discuss such things with the Organizing Team first.


Why "ChequeMarcs"

     There's a few answers to that question. Obviously "Cheques" and "Marcs"
are forms of money. The term "Checkmark" has definite Amiga connotations. So,
I put them together and got "ChequeMarcs". Also, I personally think that 
"ChequeMarcs" is more of a creative name than something like "AmiCash" or
"AmiCredits" or something similar.


*NEW* The Status:

     I have set up a web page containing information on the ChequeMarcs
Project.  The URL is: http:www.ualberta.ca/amiga/ChequeMarcs.html

     The is now also a mailing list for discussion of the project by the
Organizing Team.  Volunteers will be given the information they need to join
this mailing list.
