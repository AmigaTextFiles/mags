Here's a handy cut out and keep guide to helping you choose what to register:

1. Shareware with no restrictions or just one instant requester.
2. Stable Shareware you've been using for years without complaint.
3. Fun to play Shareware games with good Longevity.
4. Shareware that you love.
5. Freeware that you love.
6. Giftware that you love.
7. Shareware that isn't exactly what you want but looks like it has potential.

And where's what _not_ to register :)

1. Shareware with a [Register] button or [Register|Cancel] requester.
2. Shareware that locks your machine or crashes it on a regular basis.
3. Shareware written by anyone with 'Jr.' or 'III' after their name.
4. Shareware whose author has a *.edu email address.
5. Shareware that costs $20 and the author only gives you a keyfile.
6. Shareware that has a requester for 10s or more before you can start.
6. Shareware refered to as 'product'.
7. Shareware for Windows or Windows 95.
8. Shareware that was written in 1988 by some greedy American fucker.
9. Shareware that has since been made Freeware.
A. Shareware written in Blitz2/AMOS and is not a game.
B. Shareware GUI extensions that manifest themselves in Freeware (such as,
   just for example, 'About...' automatically having 'About MUI...' added
   under it, leading to a graphically pleasing window with a large 'Register'
   button)
C. Shareware start-bars
D. EaglePlayer

Hope that helps!
