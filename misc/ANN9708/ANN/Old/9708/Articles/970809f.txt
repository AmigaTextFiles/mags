Their hardware engineering department was in the amount of 100 people,
software engineering was smaller most of the time (at one time after
1.3 even down to two people IIRC).

Sure, also the first AmigaOS was the work of very few people, which
is partly the reason why it is so consequent, coherent, consistent.
