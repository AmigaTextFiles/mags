This is Tim's perception of it but it really shouldn't be the case. Tim's
conflict was just the product of bad timing.

I did disagree with what happened when he left them.. he said some stuff
which was true but really, he shouldn't have said it. Carl seemed to me
from the start to be the type of person who couldn't hang around a place
for too long anyways.  In this situation though, it was good he left when
he did. VIScorp blew things bigger then Commodore did. I still have a lot
of respect for him though.

This absoluetly false.

Didn't you want the VIC to be freeware with source code available anyways?
so what else would you get from it besides the recognition for coming up
with the idea?

I do not blindly follow those people who have some status in the community
and over the past few years have disagreed with a lot of them and what
they have presented.  However, though I do see some of your points, I do
not agree with your overall tone and false accusations being brought
forward here either. This has gone way beyond you wanting to create
something that will be the betterment of the computing world and until
such a time you can sit down with some programmers to actually explain to
them your ideas and they help you get the VIC wrote, you are wasting your
time. Forget Carl, forget Dave Haynie, Jason Compton, VIScorp, arise,
second-wind, JMS and ICOA. Get the VIC wrote and then come back and talk
to us.

I see you being the computing world's equivalent to Karl Marx.. you have a
great idea but one that will probably never come into play.

Tim, your idea is not limited to the Amiga community and it is YOU that
can't get it right. You have great typing and wording skills and for all I
know, you are probably a good orator but you are not a good teacher in
order to get people to understand what you are saying.
