Very probable. Even if not all things are there in graphics there should
be some extra code to chew.

Just what i think too, but my incentive is the speed.

But there are viable solutions. I'm using CycleGadget myself.

I want a quicker CPU, faster gfxcard and more storage :D

No :D

I haven't used SS, i just hate Mac, but i hear it's a good emu.

Not me either but when internetting i have Miami, AmFTP and occasionally
Voy (just to test my homepages now that i got my copy of AWeb II 3.0) and
that is the only time i have a MUI-app running at all. I'm looking forward
to the Miami 3.0 with a separate GUI.

Well, if you are worried about fragmentation then flushing could be
necessary but used mem will be reclaimed if someone needs it so you don't
have to worry about that.

 DL> Btw, any idea how much memory GadTools uses?

Haven't got the faintest but not so much i gather since most data comes
from your own system and GadTools code is a more advanced interface to
Intuition gadgetfunctions.

 DL> And Miami 3.0 will be available with a GadTools GUI, hurrah!

Hurrah for that!
