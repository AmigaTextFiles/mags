[Novice poster on the loose!]

I find IRC too slow, so I'll try this for a while ;^)

I just discovered that Gateway 2000 are talking Amiga with Jeff
Schindler, the guy
who made their Destination box, a huge, expensive thing with peecee
hardware and a
TV in it. All Jeff has had to do with CBM-type products, is selling Vics
and C64s before
becoming an engineer. This sounds sort of scary - we could actually get
a set top box based
on the amiga, but what if they stop at that? Judging from his past
projects (do a search on
the Gateway site!), he's a real ideas-man, but needs proper guidance :)

Maybe we should compile a list of what to avoid in future Amiga designs,
and send
this to GW? Are there already any groups out there who do this sort of
thing?
