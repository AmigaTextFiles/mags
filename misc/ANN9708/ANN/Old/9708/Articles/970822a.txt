Caution, it seems you are not very correct in your points:

"All assembler" is an exaggeration. The last report by Olaf Barthel
said 80 % of Kickstart were assembler, yet there is much more than
Kickstart to the full AmigaOS.

>2) GW2K may not want to sink the amount of cash in that Apple did

No, but a few (one-digit) million dollars can already do, and GW2K
should have that sum.

>3) The people who wrote the Amiga OS are all off elsewhere now

No, not all. There are several who would like to help, as a full-timer
or as a consultant, there are so many ways possible.

Sure, difficult, but solvable, and GW2K definitely has the means (money).
