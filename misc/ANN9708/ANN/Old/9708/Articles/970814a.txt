In my humble opinion, the days of the GUI are numbered, or at least its dominance is.
Before long (I hope!) we'll all be using CLI again  -- *voice* CLI, that is. The need to
stare at a display while physically manipulating some device that moves some small sprite
across that display in order to get a computer to do something useful is a drag (cough,
cough... :-)

This scenario does not require fully functional AI or any SciFi break-throughs as far as I
can see. IBM and several other smaller companies are making good progress in voice
recognition. (Help me here folks -- what's the name of that small company here in the
Boston area doing voice??). Get the cost down a bit more, employ the 3x to 5x faster CPUs
coming down the pike, and hook it all up with an adaptive, next-generation CLI, and all
sorts of neat (dare I say, wonderful?) things become possible at mass-consumer price
points.

My admittedly non-expert SWAG on timing?  2 to 5 years.
