@{FG Shine}Welcome to @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 7th issue of @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}.

Sorry, but I have been very busy with other duties I have, so I haven't the time
to  write  a proper editorial. So the little amount of free time I have have has
been spent in the edition of this issue.

This  magazine  does  not  have a new super-mega-cool GUI, but I can only assure
that it will be released each month. So, enjoy.

Remember to visit the @{B}SAUG-news@{UB} website, which is located in:

         @{B}www.saug.com/news.html@{UB}

or you can visit its mirrors located in:

         @{B}soporte.databasedm.es/amiga/sau/news.html@{UB}

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

         @{I}angel@saug.org @{UI}

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.

3DFX @{B}VOODOO@{UB} ADDON MODULE FOR @{B}PICASSOIV@{UB} WILL COME!
-------------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

Dear customer.

After  the  survey  about the 3Dfx add-on module for the @{B}PicassoIV@{UB} ended on 20th
December 98 we want to tell the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community the results of the survey before
christmas as a little present. As our @{B}Amiga@{UB} department expected we received over
520 preorders and 687 interests until today.

This gives us the needed feedback and support we need to develop such a product.

So you can expect that the 3dfx Add-on modul will be released next year.

More  information  and  technicals  guides will follow in January on our Website
(@{B}www.villagetronic.com/amiga/@{UB})

The whole @{B}Village Tronic@{UB} team thank you for your contribution on this survey and
wishes you merry christmas and a happy new year.

We will still give you the ability to directly order a 3dfx add-on module on the
survey  page  @{B}www.villagetronic.com/amiga/survey.html@{UB},  because  we will produce
only a limited amount of modules!

Please send any questions directly to @{I}amigasupport@village.de @{UI}

-----------------------------

A  2  level  playable  demo of @{B}Moonbases@{UB}, a real-time strategy game developed by
@{B}Homegrown Software@{UB} and published by @{B}Verkosoft@{UB}, has been released.

It  requires  an @{B}AGA Amiga@{UB} with 1 MB Fast Ram and 2 MB hard disk space. with PAL
and NTSC support, English and German language support.

This  demo is representative of the quality of the finished product. The release
of  @{B}Moonbases@{UB}  is  imminent,  master  disks  have  already  been  sent  off  for
duplication.   Keep   an  eye  on  @{B}Verkosoft@{UB}'s  web-site  for  a  release  date:

@node not03 "STATUS OF THE ESCENA'S G3-PROJECT"

STATUS OF THE @{B}ESCENA@{UB}'S @{B}G3@{UB}-PROJECT
------------------------------------------

Out  of  time  considerations  we  had  planned to implement a simplified memory
interface  that  would  enable us to test the board as well as present it at the
@{B}Computer  '98@{UB}  show.  This  simplified  interface  did  not feature @{B}ZorroIII@{UB} bus
mastering.  Since no prototype could be built in time for the show we went ahead
and implemented the full memory controller right away.

Our  initial plans had been to do the full implementation once we have a working
prototype  and  the  actual production begins. Implementing the memory interface
now  presented  us  with a few problems that had to be addressed first, but this
also means that we will not have to face these problems later.

Another  reason  for  doing the memory interface earlier is the fact that we now
have  access  to a @{B}SUN UltraSPARC@{UB} that offers much greater resources for @{B}Verilog@{UB}
simulations  than  the @{B}PC@{UB} did that was used for that purpose up to now. However,
the  Christmas season and new year's celebrations mean that the first prototypes
will not go into production until some time in January.

To  sum  things  up: we are a little behind schedule (although not as far as one
might  think based on the fact that there are still no prototypes available). We
ask  for  your  understanding,  especially  since  the  memory  interface  is  a
technologically  very  sophisticated  solution.  However, our goal remains to be
shipping the first production boards by the end of the first quarter.

@{B}IDD@{UB} ANNOUNCES THE RELEASE OF @{B}PORT MONITOR@{UB} SOFTWARE
--------------------------------------------------

@{I}** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ** @{UI}

@{B}IDD@{UB}  announces  the release of the @{B}IDD Port Monitor@{UB} software. With this software
and  an  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  computer,  you can wire sensors from doors, windows, or anything
else to your computer. The software runs in the background, scanning the sensors
and  reporting  its  readings. The software runs on ANY @{B}Amiga@{UB} computer (@{B}AmigaDOS
1.3@{UB}, @{B}2.x@{UB}, @{B}3.x@{UB}).

You  can use any of the sensors sold in electronics and home security shops that
are  designed  for  wired security systems. These include reed switches for door
and  windows  starting  at  around a dollar each. You can also use vibration and
glass  breakage  detectors,  or  even  infrared and ultrasound sensors to detect
motion  in an area. In fact, you can use digital keypads and lock & key switches
to  activate  or  disable  the  the  system  remotely. You can find all of these
devices at electronics and security shops, including @{B}Radio Shack@{UB}.

You  connect  the sensors to the computer through the joystick controller ports.
This leaves your serial and parallel ports free for your modem and printer. Note
that  no  hardware  is  included  with the @{B}Port Monitor@{UB}, it is up to you wire an
interface  to  your  sensors. This isn't hard to do, and the documentation tells
you everything you need to know.

Using  the  included configuration program, you can tell the software to respond
to  a sensor by playing a sound file, speaking with the @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s voice, recording
the  event  to disk, sending output to your printer, dialing a phone number with
your modem, sending an ARexx command, and more.

You  can  use the @{B}IDD Port Monitor@{UB} as a home security system, or use it just for
the  fun of having your computer respond when someone opens a door or walks into
a  room.  The  software  allows  you to choose to have it respond differently at
different  times of day. It also reports the time of sensor events with accuracy
of one hundreth of a second, making it suitable for scientific measurement.

The  @{B}IDD  Port Monitor@{UB} sells for $34.95 and is currently only available directly
from @{B}IDD@{UB}. For more information see our web page at @{B}www.pobox.com/~idd/@{UB}.

@node not08 "OLOFIGHT IS NOW AVAILABLE"

@{B}OLOFIGHT@{UB} IS NOW AVAILABLE
-------------------------

@{I}PRESS RELEASE @{UI}

@{B}OloFight@{UB} is finished! Official release of this outstanding title was at @{B}Computer
'98@{UB}  show  (Cologne)  and  then available from all good @{B}Amiga@{UB} dealers around the
world!

@{B}OloFight@{UB}  is  a  beat'em  up game which introduces many innovations over similar
existing  @{B}Amiga@{UB} titles. It's produced in Italy by a new software house, @{B}The Real
Ologram@{UB}.

@{I}FEATURES @{UI}:
   * 10 different fighters with more than 400 animation frames each
   * 25fps animations
   * 10 special moves for each of the fighters
   * power-ups to strenghten fighters and 'buy' 4 special moves of varying power
     (out of the ten available for each player), whose control is easier than in
     other similar titles
   * realistic  collision  detection:  the more precise your moves are, the more
     harm they will cause!
   * more  than 3000 (three thousand!) colours on screen at the same time on any
     @{B}AGA Amiga@{UB}
   * objects moving on different parallax layers, behind/in front of fighters
   * floor with 3D perspective motion!
   * background music adapting itself to the game events
   * 100% rendered graphics
   * animated backgrounds
   * shadow effect reflecting fighters' movements
   * multilingual support
   * many playing modes (story, survival, time attack, one-on-one, etc.)

It  will  also  handle high-scores for each of the modes through our web server,
thus allowing you to rival with other players all over the world!

In @{B}OloFight@{UB}'s world, every match increases the players' experience, according to
the  difficulty  of  the match itself. As a character gets more experience, both
his skills and his special moves get stronger. On top of that, new special moves
are  discovered.  A  more powerful fighter means a higher score and consequently
higher  position  in  the  various  ranks,  including the general ones which are

@{B}AMAZING@{UB} AND @{B}INFORMER@{UB} COMBINE
----------------------------

Joint  Press  Release from @{B}Eldritch Enterprises@{UB} and @{B}PiM Publications@{UB}, January 5,
1999.

@{B}PiM   Publications@{UB},   publishers   of   @{B}Amazing  Computing/Amiga@{UB},  and  @{B}Eldritch
Enterprises@{UB},  publishers  of @{B}The Amiga Informer@{UB}, are proud to announce that they
have  combined  their  efforts into one publication. This magazine will maintain
the  @{B}Amazing  Computing/Amiga@{UB}  title  and continue to be distributed through @{B}PiM
Publications@{UB}.  @{I}Fletcher  Haug, @{UI} the  Editor-in-chief of @{B}The Amiga Informer@{UB}, will
join  the  staff  of  @{B}Amazing@{UB}  and bring with him many of the resources from @{UB}The
Informer@{UB}.  @{I}"It  is  vital that the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community retain a print publication in
North  America," @{UI} said  @{I}Haug. @{UI} @{I}"By  combining  the  efforts  of @{B}The Informer@{UB} and
@{B}Amazing@{UB}, I feel we will be able to give our readers and the community a stronger
publication  that  combines  the  best qualities of both magazines. I am looking
forward to working with @{B}PiM Publications@{UB} on this project." @{UI}

Since  North  America  was  served  by  @{B}Amazing  Computing/Amiga@{UB}  and  @{B}The Amiga
Informer@{UB},  both  magazines  were in competition for the same advertising dollars
and  subscribers. In recent months, it has become clear the North American @{B}Amiga@{UB}
would  benefit  from  a  single  newsstand  distributed  publication. @{I}"These are
critical  times  for  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  marketplace  as  @{B}Amiga  Inc.@{UB} prepares the Next
Generation  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  and @{B}OS 3.5@{UB} remains in development," @{UI}stated @{B}Amazing@{UB}'s Managing
Editor, @{I}Don Hicks. @{UI}@{I}"We believe the best way to serve this industry is to combine
our   efforts   and   build  a  stronger  communication  network  from  the  two
publications.  With  this  alliance,  we can offer @{B}Amiga@{UB} vendors an unparalleled
opportunity  to  the @{B}Amiga@{UB} marketplace in North America while giving our readers
the best possible service." @{UI}

@{B}The  Amiga  Informer@{UB}  magazine  was  launched  in  April,  1996 and grew to be a
respected  publication  providing  Amigans  with insightful information and news
compiled  by  freelance  authors  worldwide.  Issue 17 of @{B}The Amiga Informer@{UB} was
recently  released  and  it  will  be  the  last  issue printed. As  part of the
arrangement  between @{B}Amazing@{UB} and @{B}The Informer@{UB}, @{B}PiM Publications@{UB} will fulfill any
outstanding   subscriptions   from   @{B}The   Informer@{UB}   with   issues  of  @{B}Amazing
Computing/Amiga@{UB}.  @{B}Eldritch  Enterprises@{UB} closed as a business, effective December
31,  1998.  Further information will soon become available at @{B}The Amiga Informer@{UB}
website    (@{B}www.amigainformer.com@{UB})    and    the   @{B}Amazing   Computing@{UB}   website
(@{B}www.pimpub.com@{UB}).

@{B}Amazing Computing/Amiga@{UB} was the world's first monthly @{B}Amiga@{UB} magazine and remains
the  longest  running  @{B}Amiga@{UB} publication. For over 13 years, @{B}AC@{UB} has provided the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  community with balanced, thoughtful reporting on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} market. The @{B}AC@{UB}
staff has also been instrumental in providing video tapes and transcripts of the
major  events  in  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  community. With the combined efforts of @{B}Amazing@{UB}'s
Amazing  Authors and @{B}The Amiga Informer@{UB}'s quality staff, the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community has
an opportunity to build an even better future publication.

We  hope  that  the  combining of @{B}Amazing Computing/Amiga@{UB} and @{B}The Amiga Informer@{UB}
will  prove  to make a stronger publication that can continue to serve the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community  and  carry it to the next level of @{B}Amiga@{UB} computing. With the combined
efforts  of both magazines' staff focused in the same direction, we believe that
the  community will be better served and will continue to get the information it
needs to move forward to the future.

Sincerely,

@{I}Fletcher Haug, @{UI}@{B}The Amiga Informer Magazine@{UB}

@{I}Don Hicks, @{UI}@{B}Amazing Computing/Amiga@{UB}

@{B}SHAPESHIFTER@{UB} GOES FREEWARE!!!
-----------------------------

@{B}ShapeShifter@{UB}  is a multitasking freeware @{B}Macintosh-II@{UB} emulator for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} and
@{B}DraCo@{UB}  computers.  It  allows  to  run  @{B}Macintosh@{UB} software concurrently to @{B}Amiga@{UB}
applications without hardware add-ons or modifications.

Some of the emulation's features:
   * Supports @{B}MacOS 7.1@{UB} thru @{B}8.1@{UB}.
   * Color  display  up to 256 colors on @{B}AGA Amiga@{UB}s (16 colors on @{B}ECS@{UB}) and up to
     16.7 million colors on graphics cards.
   * Accelerated graphics with @{B}CyberGraphX@{UB}/@{B}Picasso96@{UB}.
   * Support for one or two monitors.
   * No MMU required, even runs on @{B}A1200@{UB}.
   * @{B}Macintosh@{UB}  hard  disks  can  be simulated in @{B}Amiga@{UB} files or @{B}Amiga@{UB} hard disk
     partitions.
   * Can  use  @{B}Amiga@{UB} floppy drives, serial, parallel and SCSI ports from the @{B}Mac@{UB}
     @{B}Mac@{UB}  HD  disks can be read directly with an HD floppy drive, @{B}Mac@{UB} 720K disks
     can be used with any @{B}Amiga@{UB} floppy drive. To use @{B}Mac@{UB} 800K disks, you have to
     own  @{B}CrossMAC@{UB}  and  an  original  @{B}Mac@{UB} drive. @{B}ShapeShifter@{UB} also supports the
     @{B}Catweasel@{UB} controller.
   * 8 bit stereo sound output (sound cards supported via @{B}AHI@{UB}).
   * Sound input with parallel-port sound digitizers.
   * Access to Ethernet networks.
   * Simple networking between two @{B}Amiga@{UB}s with PLIP.
   * Text clipboard sharing between @{B}Mac@{UB} and @{B}Amiga@{UB}.
   * File handler to access @{B}Macintosh@{UB} volumes from the @{B}Workbench@{UB}.
   * Speed comparable to a real @{B}Mac@{UB} with equivalent hardware.

@{I}Requirements @{UI}:
   * @{B}OS2.1@{UB}
   * @{B}68020@{UB} processor
   * 4MB of RAM
   * HD floppy drive recommended.

A  copy of a @{B}Macintosh@{UB} 512K or 1MB ROM and the @{B}Macintosh@{UB} system software are not
included,  but  required.  The  ROM  can  be  read  off of a real @{B}Mac@{UB} by using a
supplied  program,  the system software can be bought from @{B}Apple@{UB}. Note, however,
that  reading  the  ROM  is only legal if you have bought the ROMs or own a real
@{B}Macintosh@{UB}.

The most important changes in V3.10:
   * @{B}ShapeShifter@{UB}  is  now  freeware  (keyfile  no  longer  needed to enable all
     features).
   * @{B}MacOS 8@{UB} support (requires 1MB ROM).
   * @{B}Picasso96@{UB}  PIP  (15  bit  color  depth) is used in "@{B}Amiga@{UB} Window" mode when
     available.

TWO NEW GAMES TO BE RELEASED BY @{B}ALIVE MEDIASOFT@{UB}
-----------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR INMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

@{B}Goal! Season 98-99@{UB}

@{B}Goal!  Season 98-99@{UB} is the latest installment in this excellent football series.
@{B}Alive  Mediasoft@{UB}  will  soon  be  releasing  the  latest  update for @{B}Goal!@{UB} which
features  all  the  new  teams  from  "The Premier League" through to the "Third
Division", as well as the best of the European and international teams. You also
now have the option to play league and cup competitions.

New screenshots and information will be available very soon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{B}Phoenix Fighters@{UB}

@{B}Alive  mediasoft@{UB}'s  latest  signing  is an exciting little number called @{B}Phoenix
Fighters@{UB}.  You  will see from the screenshots that @{B}PF@{UB} is an overhead shoot-em up
game.

Until  you  get to see the demo running, you can't fully appreciate this. @{B}PF@{UB} has
incredibly  high  speed,  super  smooth  scrolling. This really is a pleasure to
play.  There  are many different missions to play - and I do mean many! The main
objective  is  clearly  to reach the exit, but along the way you are set smaller
missions  and  tasks  which you must acheive before you can progress to the next
stage.

There's  also a "Race" mode. This is a high-paced, high adrenalin mode where you
race a computer controlled opponent to the exit.

There's  also  an obstacle course mode where you must fly around collecting gems
and bringing them back to base.

One  of the best features is the "Dog Fight Mode". I don't think the title needs
an  explanation, but for those who haven't played many flight games before, this
is one of the best ways to test your skill - against a friend (or enemy!)

All  the  modes are excellent, but then there's the added bonus of being able to
play  any  mode  in  a  split-screen fashion so two of you can play against each
other on the same @{B}Amiga@{UB} and same monitor.

A full feature list and demo will be available soon.

@{B}DIGITAL IMAGES@{UB} UPDATE
---------------------

@{I}FOR INMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

Although  we  haven't  been  saying  much recently, you can be assured that some
exciting developments are on the way!

@{B}Space  Station  3000@{UB}  has  been delayed for 2 months becuase we are carrying out
some  extra  work  on  the  3D  graphics engine which is starting to look really
impressive!  The  expected  system  requirements  for @{B}Space Station 3000@{UB} are any
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  with @{B}AGA@{UB} or gfx card, CD-ROM, 4Mb fast RAM and we expect that around 30Mb
HD space will be required. These specs. may change at any time, but I doubt they
will  change much. We are also hoping to add full crew personalities whereby the
crew  will  really  behave  like real people! Crew members may fall in love with
each  other  and  get married. One of the female members of your crew may become
pregnant and will require maternity leave. Some crew who have bad discipline may
attempt  to  steal equipment or starships! We are also hoping to add an internet
trading option. This will be quite good becuase you will be able to link up with
other  people  on  the  internet  and  trade  with them! That way, you could get
equipment or starships at better prices than you would with the federal dealers.
You  could  sell  your  equipment for more than you would sell it to the federal
dealers.  You  could sell software upgrades for starships etc. All this would be
payed  with the 'cyber-money' that is used in @{B}Space Station@{UB}. If you know someone
isn't  on  the  internet,  but  you would still like to trade with them, you can
trade  the  equipment via floppy disk or any other recordable media! We may also
'sell'  equipment etc. from our website which you can buy will your cyber-money!
A  small  demo  should  be  available very soon! You can pre-order this from the
@{B}Blittersoft@{UB} website at @{B}www.blittersoft.com@{UB} or by telephone on +44 (0)1908 261466
or by e-mail on @{I}sales@blittersoft.com @{UI}

@{B}Wipeout 2097@{UB} is progressing very well and we are hoping to bring you a demo very
soon.  The  finished version of @{B}Wipeout 2097@{UB} will have many other features which
aren't  included  in  the  @{B}PC@{UB}/@{B}PSX@{UB}/@{B}N64@{UB}  versions!  System  requirements should be
something  like  @{B}PPC@{UB},  16Mb  Fast  RAM,  gfx card (maybe @{B}AGA@{UB}), unknown HD space.
Currently,  the  only  ways  to  pre-order  this  is  by  sending  an  e-mail to
@{I}sales@blittersoft.com @{UI}or by telephone on +44 (0)1908 261466

@{B}Kijitsu  Warriors@{UB} and @{B}Digital Soccer@{UB} are coming along very nicely and we hope to
bring  you  some  screenshots  very soon. System requirements are expected to be
similar  for both games. They are expected to require @{B}PPC@{UB}, gfx card or @{B}AGA@{UB}, 16Mb
Fast RAM, CD-ROM, unknown HD space.

We  are  also  starting  work on our own @{B}Amiga@{UB} magazine called @{B}Amiga Style@{UB}. This
magazine  will  be  entirely dedicated to games and will start off in A5 format,
black  and white and will appear every 2 months. However, if @{B}Amiga Style@{UB} becomes
popular  and  sells  well, then it will have A4 pages and will be in full colour
and will have a cover CD. The first issue will cost £1.99

If  you  are a games developer or if you know anybody who develops games, please
get in contact with us so that we can run previews on your games. You can e-mail
@{B}Amiga  Style@{UB}  at @{I}Style@digital-images.demon.co.uk @{UI}Also, if you have any letters,
news  or  if you have any ideas for the magazine, you can contact us at the same
e-mail address.

If  you  have any questions regarding any of the above, please send an e-mail to
@{I}info@digital-images.demon.co.uk @{UI} All  e-mails  are normally replied to within 24
hours.

THE @{B}AMIGA RC5 TEAM@{UB} EFFORT TAKES ON @{B}DES III@{UB} CHALLENGE
----------------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}
January 17th 1999

@{I}The @{B}Amiga RC5 Team @{UB}effort takes on @{B}DES III @{UB}challenge @{UI}

Starting Monday the 18th at 17:00 GMT, The @{B}Amiga RC5 Team@{UB} effort enters the fray
to find the key to a secret message encrypted with a 56 bit strong @{B}DES@{UB} key in an
ongoing series of distributed computing contests and challenges.

The  goal  of  these  challenges  is manifold: to bring exposure to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} by
coming  out  in  a top 10 place in a ranked contest, to expose the weaknesses of
current  encryption  technology, to explore avenues of distributed computing and
to  offer  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  users  a worthwhile cause to band together for, perhaps to win
part of the prize money as well.

The  team  has  been working on other challenges in the past year and a half and
will return to working on @{B}RC5-64@{UB} after @{B}DES III@{UB} is completed. The @{B}DES III@{UB} contest
carries a time limited award, US $10,000 if the key is found within 24 hours, US
$5000  if  it is found within 48 hours, US $1000 if found within 56 hours and no
award after that.

In  order  to  find  the  correct  key  to  the secret message a large number of
computers  works  together over the Internet by running a special client program
which uses only idle CPU time so as not to impede normal use, each connecting to
a  central  network to fetch a part of the problem, work on it and flush it back
once done with that part.

The  @{B}Amiga  RC5  Team@{UB} effort is one of the largest teams with over 3000 machines
and  1700  people  participating,  we  are  currently  ranked 6th overall out of
thousands of teams in the ongoing @{B}RC5-64@{UB} challenge.

Everyone  is  cordially  invited to join and support us for the upcoming @{B}DES III@{UB}
challenge  and @{B}RC5-64@{UB} (and others) after that. For more information on how to do
this  and everything from statistics to member listings, see the effort homepage
at  @{B}distributed.amiga.org@{UB}.  You  can enter with any kind of machine or machines,
though one @{B}Amiga@{UB} at least is appreciated.

The  @{B}Amiga  RC5  Team@{UB}  effort is also providing a mailinglist as a forum for the
discussion on above topics and the effort in general.

For  additional info on how to participate and more in depth explanation, please

ANNOUNCEMENT: @{B}SUMMERTIMEGUARD 1.03@{UB}
----------------------------------

I am glad to announce an updated version of @{B}SummertimeGuard: v1.03@{UB}.

This  little  utility  automates  the  task  of updating your system's time when
summertime  starts  or  ends.  Each  time the computer is started, it checks the
system  time  and  updates  it  if necesarry. You are of course notified of this
change.  @{B}SummertimeGuard@{UB}  is fully localized, both for the language used and the
selection  of  a  summertime  scheme;  if  you  configured  your locale settings
correctly,  all  that  seperates  you  from automatic updating of your time is a
double click on the install icon (standard installerscript included).

The languages that are fully supported:
Dutch, English, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese and Serbian.
Languages supported but with no documentation:
Czech, German and Brazilian Portuguese.

Changes since the last version: more languages, more supported areas.

Download from the Summertime Guard Support website:
@{B}home.student.utwente.nl/e.blok/sguard@{UB}

You  can  also  visit  this  site for further information, like supported areas.
Download from @{B}Aminet@{UB} available shortly.

@{B}SPACE STATION 3000@{UB} - GIVE YOUR OPINION NOW!!!
---------------------------------------------

Hello,

As  the  release  date for @{B}Space Station 3000@{UB} stands, it won't be released for a
few months yet because more work is being carried out on the 3D engine (which is
the  same  one  used  in  @{B}Tales  Of The Heaven@{UB} I might add). The reason why I am
asking  is if we have to continue work on the 3D engine for a while, we wouldn't
be  able to make it to @{B}E3@{UB} (although I can't guarantee it if we use option 2, but
if we went with option 2 we would almost definetly be able to make an appearance
at  @{B}WOA@{UB}.  We  may  not be able to make an appearance at @{B}WOA@{UB} either if we go with
option  1).  Anyway,  I  could  bring  the release date forward, but I need your
opinion  here!  There  are  2  options.  The  more people who reply to this, the
better!

   * Option 1) Work on @{B}Space Station 3000@{UB} for another month or so and release it
     at the end of March.

   * Option  2) The 3D engine will only be used for boarding the enemy ships. No
     screenshots  have been shown yet, but I'm sure you've all seen the @{B}Tales Of
     The  Heaven@{UB}  demo so you have an idea about what it looks like. Anyway, the
     option  is  to  leave out the 3D engine and release it on the @{B}Space Station
     3000@{UB}  data CD which will be released a few months after @{B}Space Station 3000@{UB}.
     This  also  includes  other  things  such  as new music, new missions, more
     equipment etc. Anyway, if there was no 3D engine, it would be replaced with
     an  @{B}Abe's  Odyssey@{UB}  style  bit  where  you would walk around the enemy ship
     solving some puzzles and shooting up the enemy robots etc.

Anyway,  if  people  could  reply  to  this message by sending a blank e-mail to
@{I}ssvote@digital-images.demon.co.uk @{UI} before  Feb  1st  with either OPTION 1 (which
will  specify option 1 from above) or OPTION 2 (which will specify option 2 from
above) in the subject line.

Please  note  that  the high standards of gameplay will be maintained, the style
will just be different!

Please send your votes now!

Best Regards

standalone  CGI  based  executable  and  another as language module built-in the
@{B}Amiga Apache@{UB} executable.

These versions were built with support to:
   * @{B}mSQL@{UB}  Relational  Database  Management System client library version 2.0.5.
     There is a version of @{B}mSQL@{UB} for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} at: (@{B}altern.org/cfc/msql@{UB}.
   * @{B}MySQL@{UB} Relational Database Management System access
   * @{B}XML@{UB} parsing with expat @{B}XML@{UB} parser library
   * @{B}PDF@{UB} (@{B}Adobe Acrobat@{UB}) documents on-fly generation with @{B}PDFlib@{UB} version 0.6
   * @{B}GIF@{UB} images on-fly generation with @{B}GD@{UB} library version 1.3

This version (1.3.3) of @{B}Amiga Apache@{UB} (@{B}www.dsdelft.nl/~apache@{UB}) was built with @{B}PHP
3.0.6@{UB}  as  internal module by @{I}Manuel Lemos. @{UI}If you need further assistance, send

INTERVIEW WITH @{B}THE REAL OLOGRAM@{UB}
-------------------------------

@{B}The  Real Ologram@{UB} (@{B}TRA@{UB}) is a new game company which is supporting the @{B}Amiga@{UB} game
market. Its first title is a fighting arcade: @{B}Olofight@{UB}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}* Tell us, when did you got the idea to make a company to develop @{B}Amiga @{UB}games? @{UI}

@{B}The  Real  Ologram@{UB}  is a team of two people: me (@{I}Fabrizio Stoduto, @{UI}20), who does
the  programming and the management; @{I}Gaetano Russo @{UI}(24), in charge for graphics,
music  and  some programming. We met each other nine years ago, that is since we
moved  to the place where we live now. We have been into computers since we were
kids  and  we had @{B}Atari@{UB}s, 8bit @{B}Commodore@{UB}s and eventually the @{B}Amiga@{UB} (@{B}500@{UB}, @{B}1200@{UB} up
to  our  @{B}1200@{UB}s  on  steroids). I started programming in @{B}BASIC@{UB} on the @{B}C64@{UB}, then I
switched  to  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB},  using  @{B}Amos@{UB}  and,  a  bit  later,  @{B}Assembly@{UB}. @{I}Gaetano @{UI}
experienced  programming the @{B}C=16@{UB}, the @{B}C=128@{UB} (@{B}basic@{UB}/@{B}assembly@{UB}) and then the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
(@{B}Amos@{UB}/@{B}assembly@{UB}).  He  also got into graphics and music (he studied music for ten
years). As you can see, our stories are similar.

Our  main  project, as you can imagine, is @{B}Olofight@{UB}, which is getting all of our
time  and  resources.  We  also  have a friend of us helping on minor system and
network programming, @{I}Rudi Chiarito. @{UI}The web site is his duty, too.

Here  we  are  with  our  first  project,  @{B}Olofight@{UB}.  We  hope  you are going to
appreciate it.

We've  been  working for two years on it, full time. It's a BIG project! We were
always  interested  in  programming  games and two years ago we decided to begin
this  adventure.  We chose yet another beat'em up because, in our opinion, those
already  on  the  market  didn't fully exploit the @{B}Amiga@{UB} hardware and we weren't
satisfied  with  them in general, so we thought it would have been great to show
others what @{B}Amiga@{UB} is able to do despite years of stagnation. We drew inspiration
from  what  we considered good in similar games (@{B}Street Fighter@{UB}, @{B}Shadow Fighter@{UB},
@{B}Body  Blows@{UB},  @{B}Mortal  Kombat@{UB},  etc.)  and  added  other features (like the 3000+
colours on screen and more....).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}*  Though @{B}Olofight @{UB}is aim to @{B}AGA Amigas, @{UB}you are doing a patch for graphic cards
and a CD version, it's true? Will it support @{B}CyberGraphx, @{UB}@{B}Picasso96 @{UB}or both? @{UI}

A  patch  for  Gfx  board  (@{B}CyberGraphx@{UB}  and @{B}Picasso96@{UB}) will be out soon, CD-ROM
version is already out!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}*  @{B}Olofight @{UB} use more than 3000 colors in screen, how did you manage to do that?
Do you used Ham8 mode or Copper? @{UI}

We take the Copper to the limit, but we exploit the other @{B}AGA@{UB} chips as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}* Which programming language have you used to code @{B}Olofight @{UB}? @{UI}

@{B}Assembler@{UB} of course! ;-)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}*  We  know you were in @{B}Computer98 @{UB}at Cologne (Germany). What do you think about
this event? @{UI}

It  was  our  first  time  there  and we enjoyed the time we spent promoting our
title.  We  wish  there  were  more shows like Cologne, with many @{B}Amiga@{UB} users to
meet.  It  feels like being with friends. It was a nice experience for us and we
hope things will be even better next year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}* Are you planning to support @{B}PowerPC @{UB}boards in your games? @{UI}

We're  quite  optimistic about the future of @{B}Amiga@{UB}, our/your beloved machine. We
know it has potential to grow. And we really like the enthusiasm of @{B}Amiga@{UB} users!
@{B}PowerPC@{UB}  is  definitely  an  important  step towards the future. We only hope it
won't  be  adversely  affected  by  marketing,  as happened in the past with the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}s we know so well...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}*  @{B}Olofight @{UB} is  back with the tradition of old games packed with a quality box,
good  manual and register card. Do you think your products have to achieve total
quality? @{UI}

We  aim  to  bring back the quality of past games, we think this first effort of
ours is on the right path. Of course we can do better than that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}* What do you plan for future games? @{UI}

If  things turn out well, we have many ideas for new games that we would like to
do  (@{B}Amiga@{UB} only, of course). Were @{B}Olofight@{UB} to sell well, we could also port some
@{B}PC@{UB}  games  to  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}.  We think the @{B}Amiga@{UB} would benefit from that. Original
products get a higher priority, though.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}* Do you think to start programming 3D arcades like everybody do now? @{UI}

We  have  many  projects  that  we will reveal in the near future. 3D beat'em up
games  are definitely interesting stuff and there's nothing like that yet on the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}... ;)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}* How and where can people buy your products now? @{UI}

The  products  can be buy from us and all @{B}Amiga@{UB} dealers. Now. Check our web page
at @{B}www.ologram.com@{UB}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}*  Do you think new @{B}Warp3D @{UB}software from @{B}H&P @{UB}will make easier coder's to make 3d
games? @{UI}

Yes, it looks like a promising tool for game programmers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}*  Now  to finish, what do you think about @{B}Amiga Inc's @{UB}election of @{B}QNX @{UB}as OS for
the future @{B}Amiga? @{UB}Is @{B}Amiga @{UB}in the good way?.@{UI}

@{B}QNX@{UB}  is just the kernel partner. It's a good choice, but it's still a small part
of  the  whole @{B}AmigaOS5@{UB}. Until @{B}AI@{UB} starts talking to developers about the future,
with  concrete information, things will keep on being far from great. The market
is  getting  smaller  and  smaller and @{B}AI@{UB}'s clumsy moves regarding @{B}OS3.5@{UB} and the
ultra-hyper-mega-cool  chip  haven't  helped  at all. Indeed, they confirmed the
doubts of many people. Right now things don't look that great, but we still hope
they will get better. Much better, that is :-)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{I}*  Well, that's all. Thank you very much for your time Fabrizio and feel free to
tell whatever you want to our readers. @{UI}

Thank you very much!

FREE CHOICE @{B}PPC@{UB} KERNEL PETITION WEB PAGE
----------------------------------------

This   is   a   text  from  "Free  choice  @{B}PPC@{UB}  kernel  petition  Web  page"  on
@{B}jagor.srce.hr/~doozanic@{UB}

---
Free choice @{B}PPC@{UB} kernel petition Web page

It's up to @{B}Amiga@{UB} users to choose!

Since  it  is  obvious that @{B}Phase5@{UB} and @{B}Haage & Partner@{UB} can not make an agreement
between  themselfs  which can resolve the current @{B}PPC@{UB} kernel for @{B}Amiga@{UB} situation
it  is  time  for  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  users  to decide that for them. This page is not about
preferring  one  or another kernel (@{I}ppc.library@{UI} or @{B}WarpOS@{UB}), it is about giving a
@{B}PPC  Amiga@{UB}  user  the free choice to choose which one they want to use. With the
time  the  better @{B}PPC@{UB} kernel will win what will depend about number of available
@{B}PPC@{UB} programs and better particular kernel support and of course perfomance.

However,  to  archieve the equal conditions for both kernel to race against each
other  it  is important to remove @{I}ppc.library@{UI} from @{B}Blizzard PPC@{UB} flashrom. @{B}Phase5@{UB}
@{I}ppc.library@{UI}  is  loaded  all the time on @{B}BlizzardsPPC@{UB} and make a lot of problems
for @{B}Haage & Partner WarpOS@{UB} functioning correctly on these boards (it needs to be
terminated).

This  is  what this petition is all about... the free choice for @{B}Amiga PPC@{UB} users
to choose which one they want to use without forcing to one solution or another.
Right  now  @{I}ppc.library@{UI}  from  @{B}phase5@{UB}  is forcing user to use @{B}phase5@{UB} @{I}ppc.library@{UI}
kernel.  @{I}PPC.library@{UI}  can  be  placed  in  @{I}libs:@{UI}  and function correctly like it
already does on @{B}CyberStormPPC@{UB} cards.

If  you  want  that  @{I}ppc.library@{UI}  be  removed  from flashrom and placed in @{I}libs:@{UI}
instead,  sign  petition  (open  for  all  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  users,  not  just ones who own
@{B}BlizzardPPC@{UB}  card)  which  will  be sent to @{B}phase5@{UB} (Mr. @{I}Wolf Dietrich@{UI}) with this
content:


@{I}Mr. Wolf Dietrich,


With  this  petition, the @{B}Amiga@{UB} users ask to @{B}Phase5 GMBH@{UB} to move the ppc.library
of  the  @{B}BlizzardPPC@{UB} boards from the flashrom to the libs directory (like in the
@{B}CyberstormPPC@{UB}  boards). This will not disable ppc.library kernel in any way, but
it  will give to the users the freedom to choose which @{B}PPC@{UB} kernel to use. We all
hope in a Your positive reply to this issue.

Your Sincerely:

(List of users) ***@{UI}

You can sign this petition if you send an empty mail to: @{I}doozanic@public.srce.hr@{UI}

October 1998:
  * The  October  1998  issue  of @{B}CU Amiga@{UB} was the last ever published. @{B}CU Amiga
