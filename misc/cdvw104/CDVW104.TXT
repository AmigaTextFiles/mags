Editorial Page
Well, this is the last issue of CD32View.  Before you throw your hands up
and say, "Gee, another fly-by-night newsletter!", let me say that we're
changing, not disappearing.

Next month, the July issue, the focus of the magazine will turn towards
the Amiga.  We won't be ignoring the CD32, but we will start to include
reviews of Amiga games both AGA and non-AGA.  We will remain a gaming
oriented magazine.  Amiga Report has a firm grasp on the general,
all-around Amiga news/commentary area, and I don't wish to compete head-on
with it.  (Plus, I just cannot crank these issues out every week!)
However, there will be general Amiga news regarding products and software,
not just gaming news.

Why the change?  Well, for one thing, the CD32's future is not too clear.
It's hard to come up with material on a machine that is not currently
being produced and may not be produced anymore.  (You may have noticed the
size of this issue is considerably smaller than previous issues.)

Also, I feel that CD32View had a narrow scope and it was hard to find an
audience.  How many CD32 owners even had access to the newsletter?  An
Amiga newsletter will be read on an Amiga by Amiga users.  The perfect
captive audience!

Other changes?  The GIF files are gone for good.  If I include pictures in
future issues, they will be IFF format only.  This will keep the size to a
more accessable level for those with slower modems as well as keeping with
the new Amiga direction of the newsletter.  If PC owners really want to
view the pictures, there _ARE_ IFF viewers out there for the PC.

The name will be changing as well.  To make things interesting, I'm asking
you, the readers, to name it.  CD32View was my idea and it never seemed to
catch on.  It was mangled into CD32Review, CDReview, CDVIEW, and some
other interesting variations.  Can YOU come up with a cool, memorable name?
If so, send it to me at one of my several E-Mail addresses.  I'll pick the
best one..and give you complete credit.

With Commodore gone, the Amiga needs all the support it can get.  I remain
strongly committed to the Amiga and plan to keep this newsletter going as
long as I can.  I work very hard at producing this newsletter and I try to
keep the quality as high as I can.  If you would like to submit something
to the magazine, please E-Mail it to me.  Don't worry about the form or
the structure.  If it's just an article or something you thought up, send
it to me.  You'll get all the credit, and I'll find a space for it.

Sean Caszatt, editor & founder of CD32View


The Serial Port - Mail from our readers!

FROM: Marc Buhmann <WL-UNREAL-WOW@SOCIETY.COM>

Hia man! Must say that the magazine you are putting out each month is
superb! It gives out lots of information and is very enjoyable to read
at the same time. But I have a few questions that I think you may be
able to answer for me. Since the fall of Commodore, what will happen
about the free games you were supposed to get with the CD32? When I
bought it, it didn't come with any games... only the manuals. Luckily
when I bought it I had just gotten back from a trip from England where I
had purchased two games. I also bought CD! and Amiga CD32 User (two CD32
magazines... but I'm sure you knew this =-) right away when I got the
CD32 so I had a few things to play around with. But back to the point,
do you know if Commodore is going to send CD32 users the games via mail
or how are they (or were) planning this?

Lastly... do you know of anyplace I could get a cheat  sheet for
Labyrinth of Time? I'm stuck in this fantastic game. Thanks for any
response. bye and keep up the good work!!!

Stay UNREAL

Thanks, Jurgen!


Whoops!  We goofed.

Well...
-------
Last month, I apologized for the umpteenth time about not having the MPEG
module to review.  Now, with Commodore permanently out of the picture, it
doesn't look like we'll be reviewing it at all.  (Unless someone else puts it
out.)

We managed to get DEFENDER OF THE CROWN II this month.  Hopefully, next
month, we'll get ahold of GROLIER'S ENCYCLOPEDIA and finally get that out
of the way.

CD32View Credits

This newsletter is created on Amiga computers.

It is worked on in various stages using an Amiga 2500 or an Amiga 3000T.
It all depends on where I am sitting at the time I'm typing...and I'm
always carrying a disk in my jacket with the most current version.

Software used:

MEmacs, the editor supplied with every Amiga.  It's SIMPLY the best.  I've
tried others, but only MEmacs works for me.  Hey, at least I don't use ED!

Guide2Doc, by Bernd Koesling, is used to produce the ASCII/ANSI version
of the newsletter.  Thanks Koessi!

BadLinks, by Roger Nedel, is used to test the links in the Amigaguide
version of the newsletter.  Thanks, Roger!

The ASCII version is then re-formatted using AURORA v1.20 on a Compaq
Presario CDS 833.

Gunship 2000 Review
I don't want to sound like a broken record, but these straight ports from
the Amiga versions of games to the CD32 really have got to stop.  Here,
with GUNSHIP 2000, we have an excellent Amiga game ported to the CD32 with
some nice packaging and a fancy 3D rendered intro.  This has been pretty
much the extent of software development for the CD32.

Yes, GUNSHIP 2000 is a good, solid playable game.  The CD32 is up to its
ears in platform games and a flight simulator with a lot of shooting and
destruction is more than overdue.  Is this all that the CD32 is capable
of?  No.  Until TFX arrives, this looks like all we're gonna get though.

For those unfamiliar with the game, GUNSHIP 2000 allows you to strap into
one of several helicopters to carry out missions against an unnamed enemy.
You can choose missions in the Persian Gulf or in Europe.  As you move up
in ranks by completing missions, you are able to fly stronger and more
agile helicopters.

GUNSHIP 2000 was fairly speedy on an unaccelerated Amiga 500.  On the
CD32, it moves a long at a good, comfortable pace.  It never seems too
slow.  The graphics, the intro animation not included, are nothing
fantastic and don't seem to use the AGA chipset at all.  They serve their
purpose and everything's laid out well on the cockpit screen.

I was really expecting more from the CD32 version of the game, but I guess
that's going to have to stop.  The companies making CD32 games just don't
seem to want to put anything else into the games after they make the intro
animations.  It's a real let down to see these brilliant animations and
then be offered the same game I played on my Amiga 500 last summer.  I
want more than that.

I can't count anything against the actual game.  It's good.  The controls
are slightly confusing, but never awkward.  The graphics aren't pretty but
they're acceptable.  GUNSHIP 2000 is a game that fills a niche in the CD32
line-up, but will be overshadowed if something more glamorous and fun arrives.

Defender of the Crown II Review
Jim Sachs.  The name brings back memories of the Commodore 64.  When the
graphics on that machine seemed like the ultimate...until I saw the
Amiga's graphic power.  The man responsible for my appreciation of the
graphics on both machines was Jim Sachs.  His SAUCER ATTACK game for the
64 really had some impressive graphics, with a keen attention to detail.
His artwork on the Amiga was stunning to someone used seeing the 16 color
graphics of the Commodore 64 on a daily basis.

In these times of digitized cinematic intro animations and full motion
video, hand drawn graphics have grown to be less appreciated.  That's a
shame because some of them are really indicative of the time and work
that's gone into them.  The graphics of DEFENDER OF THE CROWN II may not
be state of the art, but they've got quality written all over them.

Unfortunately, they don't save the game.  As a whole, DEFENDER OF THE
CROWN II is a dressed-up version of some of the EMPIRE-type games that
have been around almost as long as computer gaming.  It's a good version
of those games, but it breaks no new ground.

The basic scenario requires you to capture as much land as possible in the
British Isles.  You can raid nearby castles or attack the forces of your
enemies to do so.  Other minor subplots are thrown in occasionally to keep
things from becoming too monotonous.  You can also enlist the help of
Robin Hood if you're a little low in experience or manpower.

After a few plays, DEFENDER OF THE CROWN II becomes quite dull.  It's
never boring to look at, but it just gets too repetitive.  There are
various ways to try and make it more interesting through different option
screens but, inevitably, it still gets boring to play.

This title is another of those caught in the pipeline when the CDTV was
discontinued.  Although unlike CD FOOTBALL, which was altered so as not to
run on the CDTV now, this one does run on that machine.  It's exactly the
same on that machine, which goes to show you how little of the CD32's
power it uses.

A nostalgic game, but one with with little longevity.  Might be fun for
younger kids.  Die-hard gamers may want to pass this one over.

Alfred Chicken Review
Can someone please tell somebody who can do something about it that we
don't need any more platform games on the CD32?  Even if some of them are
good, we don't need so many.  Half of the first wave of games released for
the machine were platform games.  I think we've had our fill now...thank you.

That said, ALFRED CHICKEN is not a bad game.  It's not particularly
noteworthy or charming, but it's a pleasant enough game.  It's graphics
would look stunning on a Nintendo Entertainment System, the 8-bit one.
That should give you a clue as to what's going on here.  Another mindless
SUPER MARIO type game with the cuteness-intensity level turned to 11.

The mechanics are the same as with any other platform game released after
SUPER MARIO BROS.  You jump around collecting things while avoiding
enemies and finding "secret" levels and entering bonus rounds.  Definitely
not ground-breaking stuff here.

The CD32's control pad is serviceable with A.C.  It provides adequate
control with the occasional non-responding tendency that is unfortunately
becoming familiar to CD32 owners.  You won't find yourself wanting to
throw it through the wall with ALFRED CHICKEN though.

If you don't own OSCAR, ARABIAN NIGHTS, TROLLS, ZOOL, SUPER METHANE
BROTHERS, FURY OF THE FURRIES or any of the other CD32 platform games,
then you might want to take a look at this.  Otherwise, let it sit on the
shelf.  You wouldn't be getting anything you don't already have.

Diggers Review
DIGGERS is a game I just didn't quite get.  It's a LEMMINGS clone, minus
the easy control method, the personality, and that "sit down and play
without a manual" charm.

The object is to dig into the ground and mine various objects while
avoiding other miners (seen as competitors) and various underground
dwellers.

I was never able to quite understand what was going on.  The control
method used to move the diggers around was clumsy and felt very awkward.
The diggers would sometimes do what I wanted and other times acted as if
they had minds of their own.  Others would accept one command and then act
as if they were deaf, never listening to another thing I asked them to do.
After several attempts to get things to work, I decided that I really
didn't care and didn't want to play the game.  To me that's not the sign
of a game worth playing.

Reading the instructions was little help.  The packaging is nice and well
put together, but didn't provide me with many clues on how to play the
game to get any fun out of it.

The graphics were OK.  The sounds were OK.  I just couldn't get much out
of the game.  I know some people really enjoy the game.  I asked one of
them if he could give me a clue so I could at least feel that I knew what
I was doing.  His clue was "Visualize the whole play area as a grid."
That didn't help me much, but I pass it along to you.  Maybe you can get
some enjoyment out of this game.  I just couldn't seem to.

¹ - Games were not originally reviewed in CD32View and the rating given is
translated from a different rating method.

The Ratings - Explained

We judge the games we review in four different categories:

Graphics
--------
This is pretty self explanatory.  The higher the percentile, the better
the graphics are.

Sound
-----
Another no-brainer.  The higher the percentile, the better the sound.
Although, this also relates to it's coordination with the gameplay.  If
the sound seems inappropriate for the type of game it is, the game will
score lower in the Sound category even if the sounds are technically well
done.

Gameplay
--------
The gameplay refers to the addictive quality of the game as well as the
way the game plays.  If you find your self sitting and watching rather
than interacting with the game, the game will score lower than one that
actually involves you.

Control
-------
This refers to how easy the game is to control given the standard CD32
controller.  A game requiring a special controller that is not specified
or not included will be penalized.  A game that comes with a special
controller or one that recommends that, say, an Amiga mouse might work
better than the standard CD32 controller will not be penalized.

The SX-1 Module
The SX-1 still has not been released.  At press time, the unit was still
expected to be 2-3 WEEKS from shipping.  Many potential buyers are now
beginning to doubt the thing will ever ship.

Paravision, the company that will be releasing the SX-1 through their
Microbotics division, have plans to release a low cost, black AT-style
keyboard for use with the SX-1.  Look for it to sell for about $50.00.

Of course, the CD32 can also use an Amiga 4000 keyboard or an A2000/A3000
keyboard with the use of a small adapter.

European News
Here are the latest in European rumors from
Jurgen Arnold [FIDO:2:286/407.23]

- Lemmings 3 will come out on the CD32

- Dutch hardware company Eureka is making the final touches to the CD32
Photo CD sytem called "Photolite", price will be fixed at around $ 80.
Unfortunately there will be no zoom mode avialable. Also the
Communicator will be ready "within 2 weeks".

- Due to C= fortunes lately Dutch electronics store network Dixons (bit
like Tandy) has recalled all CD32 machines and software. No explanation
was given. Now only specialized Amiga retailers and mailorder companies
sell the CD32 in Holland.

This following is an article from "Cd32 Gamer", a new title dedicated to
our machine:
"Japanese coin-op maker Namco is leading a tide of arcade companies
interested in CD32 technology. MD UK David Pleasance hinted numerous
coin-op makers were eager to put games onto cd32 "because it allows them
to do a good representation of their arcade titles." He refused to name
names since negotiations were still underway, but Namco has revealed it
is definitely involved. Namco owns the world largest chain of arcades and
has long been an front runner in developing coin-ops. Its most recent
release is the stunning Ridge Racer, a race game with near photographic
quality polygon graphics. Although there are no plans, as yet, to convert
Ridge Racer, past-hits such as the spectacular Starblade are under active
discussion. Starblade is a brilliant sc-fi shoot-'em-'up which was a major
source of inspiration for Starwing (StarFox in the U.S.), although
obviously even a SNES with a Super FX Chip could hardly match the coin-op's
fantastic graphics. The CD32 conversion would make heavy use of its CD-ROM
technology, in similair fashion to a nearly finished Mega-CD (Sega-CD)
verison, but would obviously be far superior given its technological
edge."

Hints & Tips
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This month's tip:  SUMMER OLYMPIX

When playing the javelin event, try to start your throw when the distance
counter at the right hand side of the screen is around 35.00.  Through
some experimentation, you should be able to get the timing right and
start hitting about 90 meter throws everytime.
