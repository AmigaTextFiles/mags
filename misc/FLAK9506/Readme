Welcome to the September 1995 issue of the GAC FLAK!

This issue uses only fonts from the PageStream3 release with the
exception of HelvNrw-BoldItalic (which came with later versions of
PageStream3 but which some of you might not have. It is available from
Soft-Logik Publishing for a nominal fee.) and Futurist-BoldItalic and
OldEnglish-Gothic which are from the Keyfonts for Macintosh collection
(I got the collection at Office Depot).

I decided to subdivide the archive into PageStream2 and 3 directories so
that it would be easier to tell which documents were from which version.

There is a news release from Quantum concerning new 2½" harddrives; an
article about the Internet; and the first President's Corner from Barry
Holloway---our new President here at G.A.C.
