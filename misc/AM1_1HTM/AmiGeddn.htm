<P>This correspondent pleads guilty....  of having communicated a lot
of "doom and gloom" over the past couple of Amiga years.    It
wasn't my intention to be a "nattering nabob of negativism" ...
just trying to communicate a realistic view of the situation as I
saw it from my vantage point.</P>

<P>On reflection, the nadir was reached with the following comment
from the Sam Report of September 9, 1995:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"CEI's neighbor to the East on busy Flagler Street is a large cemetery.  I suspect 
that the Amiga (as a consumer computer in North America) was buried there by Escom on April 21, 
1995."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As much as I hated to write that (and you hated to read it), 
subsequent events confirmed the worst as Amiga Technologies 
fumbled in its valiant attempt to revive the platform and Escom
eventually went belly-up after selling out to the highly dubious
Viscorp.    The interim illusions of promises by such names as
SMG, QuikPak, phase5, PIOS, etc.  fell well short of credibility.
To some, even the old days of Commodore started to look good!</P>

<P>It is time now, my fellow Amigans, for a reality check.   The
glory days of Babylon5, etc.  are long gone and anyone who reads
the video trade mags knows that other, more sophisticated 
platforms have replaced the Amiga as an industrial tool.   If we
were ever in the Major Leagues (debatable), we are certainly now
....buried deep in the Minors.</P>

<P>Gone are the good old days of the Tenax catalogs 4 times a year, the thick Amiga Worlds with 7 
page Creative Computer ads, gone are those fascinating purple Grapevine offerings.  Gone is my 
beloved CEI next to the cemetery.    NewTek and Scala are PC people now.  Most ex-Amigans are 
PC 
people now!</P>

<P>So where are we in this so-called "reality check" ?  Certainly
not where we used to be, or would like to be, but still alive!
We've got our fine machines that seem to last forever, we have 
all that great new industry-standard hardware that easily
configures onto our aging boxes (Zip Drives, CDROMs, etc.), we
have some software folks who (bless them) keep cranking out
new things, we have firms like Software Hut and Safe Harbor who
keep hanging on, we have the Europeans who seem to never say die,
and lastly...  we have the example of those tenacious C64 folks
whose example should be increasingly relevant to us.</P>

<P>Bottom line....hang in there Amiga-guys.   We still have a lot
going for us and...  who knows? ....a miracle could happen!</P>
