<CENTER><H1><I>Editor's Notes...</I></H1></CENTER>
<P>First, I would like to thank you all for your interest in our new online Amiga magazine, "The Amiga 
Monitor." With this being our first issue, there is a great deal to be said about what our mission is, 
what we hope to accomplish and how, and what it all means for you, the Amiga community.  My intro
ductory article (listed below in the Table of Contents) will attempt to explain the format and general 
philosophy of "The Amiga Monitor."</P>
<P>The Amiga's future is quite uncertain now.  It could cease to exist in a technological sense now, 
or it could go on achieve a certain measure of success in the computer industry.  There will probably 
be very little middle ground in this case.  Although much of what will happen to the Amiga depends 
upon the companies involved with it, much more still is based on the actions, and views, of the Amiga 
community.  Yes, my friends, you and I and the rest of us; we have achieved a greater level of 
"community spirit" than the proponents of nearly any other product in industrial history.  And we 
should be proud of that, and take advantage of it.  These are trying times, and they are crucial times; 
and we want to make the best of them.
So without further ado, we will enter Volume 1, Issue 1 of "The Amiga Monitor."</P>

In our current state of affairs, one cannot help but look back fondly upon the earlier years; but as
