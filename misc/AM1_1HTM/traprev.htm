<BR>

<P>Remember when people said that you simply couldn't do a texture mapped dungeon

game like Doom? Now we can't seem to get away from them.  To the list which includes

Gloom, Breathless, Nemac IV, and Alien Breed 3D must be added Trapped.  

What this one offers that is different is that it gives up the guns and grenades for swords 

and magic.</P>

<P>This demo can be obtained from Aminet in the games/demos directory as 

TrappedJune.LHA or with the new Grafitti chunky graphics card.  You start out by selecting

one of the four supplied characters to fit your playing style.  Each has differing statistics.

You then start in Level 3 with sword in hand.  By pressing the F8 key you have control

over the game parameters in the options screen.  You can lower the graphics complexity

of the game to increase performance for slower Amigas or, if you have a 50MHz 

68030 or above, you can have all the bells and whistles.  The player is helped through 

this by being able to select presets based on processor type.  You have control over the 

audio filter, the size of the play screen, the relative brightness and the displaying of 

floor/ceiling textures and lens flares.</P>

<P>One of the impressive and troubling features of this game are that as your character

walks aroung the dungeon, you are treated with realistic animated lens flares, assuming

you did not turn them off in the options.  These brighten as you approach any 

light source and move as your character turns.  The problem is that they also often appear

even for light sources that are not quite visible.  These ghost lens flares are 

easy to confuse for an approaching enemy until you get used to them.  Still, they are 

unique on the Amiga to this game.</P>

<P>The next problem I have with this game is the combat.  After striking at your enemy,

a hand icon becomes ghosted for short period of time where you cannot strike 

again.  I personally prefer quick action and often find myself frustratedly pressing my left 

mouse button, my character getting pummelled, while waiting to be able to hit again.</P>

<P>There, with those out of the way I can tell you more about the game.  It runs at 

largest in about 3/4 of the screen with the rest showing you status information about 

your character and weapons.  There are potions to increase your health and spells to 

damage oponents, all available from the keyboard, assuming you have any in your inventory.

On my 50 MHz 68030 this game runs as smooth as silk at full complexity and 

screen size.  The game also supports OCS/EGS/AGA and the new Graffiti graphics card.</P>

<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=center><B>Installation</B></H3>

<P>Decompress the game to a directory.  Boot up your machine in PAL mode if it isn't in

that mode already.  Read the readme file.  Play the game.</P>

<CENTER><H3><B>Results/Analysis</B></H3></CENTER>
<P>This game is a real diamond in the rough.  It looks good, plays fast and smooth and allows 
you to configure it to slower machines for the enjoyment of nearly all Amiga owners.  The
inclusion of support for OCS/ECS Amigas is a real suprise treat.</P>
<P>YAY! Trapped August demo was just released today (07/31/96).  It has more ambiance.  Your
footsteps echo, you can use the cursor keys to move, including backward! There are new, better
textures for the walls and some rooms now have objects in them.  Add 10% to controls, 
10% to playability, 5% to graphics and 5% to the sound percentages below, giving 
Trapped August Demo a total of 88.3%.  The only thing left is the phantom lens flares, 
but I can live with that.</P>  

<CENTER><H3><B>Suggestions for improvement</B></H3></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI><B>Make the combat less annoying</B><BR>
Make the pause shorter between strikes.
<LI><B>Fix the phantom lens flares</B><BR>
It can be very disconcerting to see a lens flare in the distance for a light you cannot see.
<LI><B>NTSC version</B><BR>
Since my Amiga 2500 with Opalvision and Workbench 2.1 would not boot into PAL mode, I could not 
test it on this OCS machine with its 68020.
<LI><B>Add the ability to move backward - Has been fixed in the August release</B><BR>
Movement is effected by moving the mouse left/right and pressing the right button for forward.  Since 
the left button is for attack there is no reverse which would be a real help in combat situations.

Couldn't be easier just decompress, drag and drop
<BR>
Smooth movement, but combat could be better
<BR>
Hard to believe its not AGA in 64 color OCS mode
<BR>
A little more ambiance would help
<BR>
A readme with all you need to play the demo
<BR>
A little too non-standard for this type of game.

This game and its engine have a definite future.  Even with the few faults it is one of the better games 
of this type for the Amiga.  I can't harp enough on the fact that it supports older OCS/ECS Amigas 
along with us AGA owners.  A definate plus in my book.
