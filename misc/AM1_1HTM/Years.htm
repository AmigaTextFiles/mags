<H1>Where Have the Years Gone?</H1>
<H4><I>The Amiga's second decade is well under way, and more than ever, questions of the future 
occupy our thoughts...and feelings</I></H4>

<P>People have been known to say "if only I could go back...," and the typical response is that you 
can't go back.  This is true of time and space alike; you can return to your childhood home 30 years 
down the line, but will it ever be the same?</P>

<P>But a pervading question becomes: if I could go back, and so with the foreknowledge and 
experience of my life so far, would I be able to, or for that matter, try to change anything? And should 
I return <I>without</I> that knowledge, would there be any gain in simply re-experiencing life so far? 
Surely that would leave me in the same situation in which I now find myself, and from which I clearly 
wish to escape, at least temporarily.</P>

<P>Let's take a look back to 1985.  President Ronald Reagan's second US administration was in full 
swing, Japan was embarrassing the US in the automobile markets, progressive rock was falling out of 
favor with pop culture-oriented youth, and the Amiga had just been introduced.  This, of course, only 
a 
few years after the IBM PC and Macintosh, respectively, had been developed.  The microcomputer 
industry, although not new, was in its fledgling stages at least as far as mass markets -- and 
comsumer-oriented products, for that matter -- were concerned.  Commodore took the Amiga under 
its 
wing, and took the computer world by surprise.  Here was a computer with a multitasking operating 
system, graphical user interface, amazing animation, 4096 colors, and versatile video capabilities, all 
for a good deal less money than most other systems that couldn't even begin to compare in 
capability; but there's no need to retell this story, for you've all heard it enough times.</P>

<P>For a time, the entire computer industry was at least aware of the Amiga, if not impressed by it.  It 
had experienced a strong start, only to be followed by relatively weak growth.  It began to become ob-
vious that Commodore was extremely hesitant to aggressively push their star product, but riding on 
the momentum of its introduction, the Amiga continued to move forward somewhat.  In 1987, the 
Amiga industry began to show more promise with the introduction of the A500 and A2000, but still 
Commodore did not market effectively.</P>

<P>The saga, of course, continues up through present day.  The A3000 was a brilliant product, but its 
potential success was severely stunted.  The same occurred in 1992 with the onset of AGA.  Yet 
riding 
on the shoulders of its past and on the committment and support of the Amiga community, and 
bolstered by Newtek's explosion into the desktop and professional video industry, the Amiga some-
how continued to survive.</P>

<P>So where does that leave us today? More or less with a 4-year technological deficit in the wake 
of Commodore's illness (more the final onslaught of a chronic disease than a sudden infection) and 
quick death, which not only took its toll as any such disruption of the business cycle would, but also in 
the extended fashion caused by the legal wrangling over Commodore's assets, and continued by 
what many people judge to be a gross misinterpretation of the Amiga industry by ESCOM; further, 
today, we find ourselves plunging into yet another abyss, at the end of which may exist...what? A final 
chance at true success for the Amiga, or that which all "efforts" so far have not been able to attain: 
the ultimate destruction of the Amiga, and the dream on which it stands.</P>

<P>But if you take a look back to 1987, you see a good era for the Amiga...or at least comparatively 
so.  It wasn't difficult to find Amiga dealers, or user groups, for that matter.  Resources were at hand, 
and you could actually use them, even if you had problems or questions.  Programmers and 
hardware 
designers alike were frequently breaking new ground.  Few people questioned the Amiga's potential 
or capability.  People were enthralled with the power and convenience of the Deluxe Paint series; 
F/A-18 Interceptor dispelled any doubts of the Amiga's graphics, sound, and processing power; Word 
Perfect for the Amiga showed that the Amiga stirred legitimate interest in other segments of the 
computer industry.  And today...? Well, Deluxe Paint V (not to mention its competition) blows away its 
predecessors; games like Gloom and Nemac are all the rave; Final Writer 5 and Wordworth 5 
thoroughly show up WP and anything else from the era.  And at the same time, we our in our time of 
greatest stress.  It's interesting how much better, and how much worse, some things can be.  There 
was hope in 1987.  Was it false hope? In light of our current predicament(s), one might be compelled 
to say "Uh...yeah, somehow I think so." But without any certain knowledge of what is coming next, we 
can't say for sure.  It sure is hard to judge a book by its cover, but even harder to judge a book by one 
of its chapters.  In other words, we can't see the whole story because we are acting it out.  And the 
drama continues...</P>

<P>I believe it was Cher who said something about what she'd do if she could turn back time...well, 
we're mere mortals, last I checked, and we seem to be fairly well confined to where we are now.  
Although the past may have seemed more positive, it would most certainly lead right back to where 
we are now.  We have been given a situation on which to act, and we have to make the best of it.  
The 
future is shrouded in mystery and fraught with peril.  We aren't within the minds of the corporate 
executives, or the engineers; we are, however, the users, the backbone of the entire community and 
industry.  For the Amiga to survive, we must have strength, determination, and resources.  It's going 
to take sincerity, and it's going to take leadership.  And it's going to take a united effort.</P>

<P>It is truly amazing that this platform has survived as long as it has, and it is testimony to the 
incredible support of the community that has grown around it.  But this can only go so far.  There's no 
question that we could continue to survive as a group for some time, as evidenced by Commdore's 
earlier ventures (C64 ,C128, and others), and Apple's stepping stone to the Macintosh, the Apple II.  
It 
is no coincidence that the Roundtables on Genie dedicated to those two platforms, in conjunction with 
the Starship Amiga Roundtable, comprise some of the busiest areas on all of Genie.  But I, and I think 
many others as well, do NOT want THAT kind of a destiny.  As far as cutting edge computing is 
concerned, those other platforms, I am sorry to say, are permanently out of the question.  But right 
now (and I emphasize that this will NOT remain true forever, and we absolutely MUST end this 
stagnant period if there is to be ANY hope), the Amiga fortunately remains somewhat on a par with 
the IBM PC and Macintosh platforms, albeit in some ways marginally.</P>

<P>It's STILL not too late.  We have survived so much opposition and so many obstacles that it is all 
we know, and yet we continue to hold out hope.  Whatever you do, remember what this is, and what it 
stands for; always have faith in your inspirations and aspirations.</P>

<P>We are so tenacious that we just won't give up the dream.  And I hope we never have to.</P>
