<H1 ALIGN=center>Final Writer 5</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=center><I>Softwood enters Round 5 of the Word Processor Battle,

and they've come out swinging</I></H4>

<HR>

<BR>

<P>When Softwood introduced Final Writer a few years back, many people were

quite pleased.  No, this wasn't a case of &quot;this product has promise;&quot;

it was a case of &quot;this is one great product right now!&quot; Well, not

to leave well enough alone, they introduced updates at fairly regular intervals,

sometimes tuning up little details, and other times, implementing major new

features and design revisions.</P>

<P>All of this has culminated in Final Writer Release 5, introduced this spring.

This, of course, shortly after the release of version 5 of Final Writer's

greatest (perhaps only?) competitor, Digita's Wordworth, which also seemed

to gain a favorable reaction from the Amiga press.  So Softwood had a lot

to live up to.</P>

<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=center><B>Upgrade time!</B></H3>

<P>[Registered] owners of Softwood products have probably grown accustomed

to receiving notices in Final Writer-printed envelopes and documents in the

mail from time to time, either in the form of an announcement for the latest

Final Widget program, or an upgrade notice for a current one.  Not to knock

this; it is good to see a company that actually communicates with its customers

(it seems that, in the past, product registration cards were sometimes bundled

with products just as a matter of course).  Well, the day came in May when

I found one such thing in my mailbox.  Apparently Softwood had once again

defied the idea implied by the word &quot;Final&quot; and developed a new

version of its program.  In addition, they were offering several upgrade options,

with the program by itself, or bundled with the Windows 95 version of the

program (which they take great pains to point out was developed by an independent

group), or with a web site on Softwood's new web server.</P>

<P>So I wasted no time in calling the order number and requesting a copy of

Final Writer 5.  No, I had to say, I don't have Windows 95 on my PC, and I

already have a web site; but they were pleased to send me Final Writer 5

nonetheless.</P>

<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=center><B>Installation</B></H3>

<P>There's almost nothing to say here.  Any competently-written Amiga program

these days is likely to be easy to install, largely because of the ease-of-use

and standardization brought with Commodore's Installer program.  Final Writer

held true to this standard, and its past precedents, in that regard.  The

update came in the form of a 3-disk set to replace the previous disks 1,

8, and 9.  Also included are explicit instructions for installing it.  You

really can't go wrong.  In terms of manuals, a &quot;Final Writer Release

5 User Manual Addendum&quot; is included which, incidentally, is significantly

thicker than the old Release 3 Addendum.</P>

<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=center><B>First Impressions</B></H3>

<P>When Final Writer opens, the only difference you're likely to notice at

first is the screen title: &quot;Final Writer - Release 5.&quot; The first-rate

and incredibly thorough graphical user interface remains fairly consistent

with Release 5.  The improvements are more &quot;internal.&quot;</P

<P>What you are likely to notice quickly if you should happen to press the right

mouse button is that the menu layout has changed somewhat.  There is a new

menu area labeled &quot;Tables.&quot; &quot;Font&quot; has been added to

&quot;Layout.&quot; And the &quot;New,&quot; &quot;Save,&quot; and &quot;Open&quot;

items in the &quot;File&quot; menu have been changed somewhat to provide

greater versatility.  We'll get into this in terms of the new features.</P>

<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=center><B>What's new?</B></H3>

<P>After all, people generally don't buy a program for a number that's pinned

on it; they are interested in its capabilities.  Final Writer 5 introduces

a number of new features and updates, so we will cover these briefly (without

echoing the manual addendum verbatim).</P>

<UL><LI><B>"Select Font" requester</B><BR>

FW5 makes this feature more convenient by giving it its own item in the "Layout" menu.

<LI><B>Predefined zoom levels</B><BR>

You can now select from several different zoom percentages from the "Zoom" menu.

<LI><B>Styles enhancements</B><BR>

There are several improvements to this aspect of Final Writer.  For example, styles can now be 
created "Based on" other styles, i.e.  they start with the same settings as the styles on which they are 
based.  This makes it easier to have relative, rather than absolute, differences in the structure of a 
document.  You can also set up an automatic style sequence, meaning that when you end one 
paragraph and begin another, the program automatically switches to the next specified style.  There 
are several other enhancements in this category.

<LI><B>Saving and opening preferences</B><BR>

Thank you, Softwood! That's what I can hear many Amiga users saying right now.  You can now save 
multiple configurations with Final Writer, so if you have several different preferred "operating modes," 
you can easily switch between them.

<LI><B>Saving and opening style sheets</B><BR>

Yes, yet another style enhancement! It's fairly well self-explanatory, and goes along with the 
philosophy expressed by the above item.

<LI><B>Document templates</B><BR>

This is another "modular" idea in FW5: it allows you to have certain settings, and even text layouts, 
preset for different types of documents.  Examples include 2 each of Fax Cover, Letter, and Memo 
templates, and an HTML template (to be explained further shortly...)

<LI><B>Auto Correct</B><BR>

This is a new feature that goes further to help you write gooder...er, better, methinks.  It actually adds 
several capabilities in one: (each of these features can be disabled independently if you find them 
annoying, or inappropriate for a particular document) Capitalize First Letter of Sentences, Correct 
TWo INitial CApitals (yes, that's how it is displayed by the program), and Replace Words as you type.  
This last one opens several possibilities: first of all, if you are into the habit of typing "adn" and "teh," it 
will remedy the situation.  In addition, it makes it easier to insert often-used phrases.  For example, 
you can set it to replace "FW5" with "Final Writer 5" or, as I do, "cm" with 
"103165.3700@compuserve.com."

<LI><B>GUI configurability</B><BR>

The user interface is a bit more configurable, such as optional use of various click tabs.

<LI><B>"Type Specs" accessibility</B><BR>

You can now add "Type Specs" items to the User menu.

<LI><B>File requesters</B><BR>

I don't fully understand this addition, and Softwood doesn't fully explain it, but you can now set the 
program to use ASL requesters (for those who don't know, these are the requesters displayed by 
almost every program written in the last 6 years or so) instead of the custom ones which are, in fact, 
quite similar.  In fact, when I first got Final Writer Release 3, I wasn't being particularly observant and 
mistook the file requesters for the standard ASL variety.  Basically, the difference is that ASL 
requesters have keyboard shortcuts for navigating the directory structure, they have menus that let 
you perform a variety of functions, and they can be resized.  Final Writer's requesters in no way 
violate the Amiga style guide, unless you insist that all programs use the ASL requester, and in fact, 
many people think they are a better match for Final Writer's GUI than the ASL ones...but apparently, 
some people wanted ASL, so Softwood gave it to them.

<LI><B>Changing the order of sections</B><BR>

You can now rearrange your sections.  Very nice.

<LI><B>Public Screen</B><BR>

Final Writer 5's custom screen is now a public screen.  Plain and simple.

<LI><B>Preloading Fonts</B><BR>

You can now set the program to automatically load particular fonts when it first runs.  Very nice.

<LI><B>Tables</B><BR>

This is fairly self-explanatory.  It is a feature that allows you to organize data automatically into 
row/column cells.  The tables also allow different attributes to be set in different regions of the table.  
I'd call it a home run for Softwood.  The dimensions of the tables are automatically handled by the 
program to accommodate what you type.  There is a lot to say about Final Writer's tables, far more 
than we can cover here.  It is a powerful feature with myriad powerful supporting capabilities.

<LI><B>RTF import and export</B><BR>

This goes along with the modularization/standardization idea.  You can now save and load 
documents in the Rich Text Format supported by many word processors on the other platforms.  You 
configure this feature by specifying Final Writer fonts to map to the RTF fonts, basically in the form of 
a translation table.

<LI><B>Datatype support</B><BR>

Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Datatypes are among the most useful and ingenious of the OS's 
capabilities, and unfortunately, have been both grossly unused by applications, and grossly 
undeveloped by datatype programmers.  This addition to Final Writer allows you to import any image 
format for which you have datatype support.

<LI><B>Grammar Correction System</B><BR>

This major feature introduced in Release 4 has apparently been improved in a number of ways, 
including performance.  Softwood doesn't go into great detail here, so neither will I.

<LI><B>HTML</B><BR>

Very, very good, Softwood! They have followed clearly the growing importance of the internet in 
recent years, particularly in reference to the WWW, and as a result, have incorporated support for the 
creation of HTML documents with Final Writer.  This takes advantage of the Template feature 
mentioned earlier so that is specifies various styles of HTML code.  Any unsupported features can be 
entered by the user in HTML itself.  Exporting an HTML document is done the same way as 
exportation of any other format, e.g.  ASCII or RTF.  To sum up the feature support, it allows for just 
about every type style (normal, headline, blockquote, preformatted, etc....bold, italic, underline, 
strikethrough, etc.).  It allows images to be included just as with normal Final Writer documents.  
There is a lot to be added.  Basically, it's a truly excellent idea, but it needs development.  If you 
happen to be reading the HTML version of this magazine, I wrote most of this document using Final 
Writer 5 and the HTML export driver.  There are also some "quirks." I have created several HTML 
documents using Final Writer 5's HTML export driver, and once (and once only), some inexplicable 
style attributes and various other markups were inserted into the document, so that I had to make 
little edits myself after exporting it.  It was a case of  apparently pressing one or more of FW's 
Bold/Italic/Underline buttons one too many times.  It was a minor problem, but it was a throwback to 
the old WordPerfect "Hidden Codes" days.  Despite such first version-deficiencies, though, it does 
allow for easy layout of rudimentary HTML documents, and could probably be carried to greater 
extents in future versions.  Ironically, the new "Table" feature introduced into the Final Writer side of 
the program is not yet supported by the HTML side.  Maybe this will change.  Of course, you can 
always embed native HTML code, if you're into those types of things.

<LI><B>Modified ARexx Comands</B><BR>

Final Writer 5 has some modified ARexx commands, and some new ones, generally in reference to 
the new features outlined above.  The manual addendum provides a thorough description.

</UL>

<CENTER><H3><B>Results/Analysis</B></H3></CENTER>
<P>In conclusion, as a Final Writer user of several years, and as a writer for this magazine, I give 
Final Writer 5 a high rating.  Softwood has made a number of significant improvements in their 
heavy-duty word processor, and it's more user-friendly than ever.  The new Table feature, and HTML 
export driver, broaden the capabilities of an already wide-ranging program, and the RTF capability 
can only aid Softwood's rapport with the word processing community.  We also mustn't forget how 
fortunate we are to still have Softwood around.  The last few years have been trying times, and many 
companies have not survived them.  But Softwood has stuck with us, and continued to update their 
products.  Despite how good this program is, there are, however, several things that could be 
improved or added.</P>

<CENTER><H3><B>Suggestions for improvement</B></H3></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI><B>Online Help!</B><BR>
I can't emphasize this enough.  The AmigaGuide hypertext online help system has been grossly 
underused by Amiga applications.  Even the workbench itself is lacking this essential feature.  It is 
unfortunate, because it is another one of the truly useful parts of the OS.  In MicroSoft Windows, just 
about everything has an online help facility.  Now, I'm not saying everything including ShowConfig 
should be given an online help system; but surely something as big as Final Writer should have one.  
The Amiga even has a help key, for goodness sakes! It's ironic that Windows, having to use F1, has 
gone so much farther in this direction.  Programmers seem to have forgotten about AmigaGuide.  I'm 
not sure why Final Writer doesn't include an online help system, but I can say it would be a very good 
addition to the program in the next version.
<LI><B>Font previews</B><BR>
Selection and usage of fonts could be made significantly easier if there was a way to show a sample 
of a font within the requester.
<LI><B>Multiple alignments on one line</B><BR>
Back, years ago, when I used WordPerfect for the Amiga, I remember frequently using left-aligned 
and right-aligned text on the same line in order to construct headings for school papers.  Unless I 
have missed something obvious, I have not found any way to do this with Final Writer, or any other 
word processor, for that matter.  I realize FW is a paragraph-oriented word processor, but it would be 
very convenient if it allowed multiple justifications of text on one line.
<LI><B>Multitasking/multithreading/print spooling</B><BR>
Now, there is no doubt that Final Writer is, in fact, multithreaded, and that it multitasks with the 
system.  So why am I mentioning this? It all really comes down to printing.  Once you begin to print a 
document, that document window locks up, and control isn't returned until printing finishes.  
Softwood, of course, had no choice but to write their own printing routines, since the system's built-in 
print spooling capability was not designed with outline fonts and Final Writer-style postscript-type 
printing in mind.  But it seems to me, then, that Final Writer should be designed with its own 
centralized, modular printing system as long as the OS does not support that capability.  That way, a 
particular instance of Final Writer could call that printing system, send it a document, and then get 
back to word processing.  As it is now, once you start printing, if you want to open a new document, 
you must return to Workbench and run Final Writer again.  Not a big deal, but it could be made easier 
and more efficient.  And have you ever opened a print prefs requester from another FW doc whilst 
one is printing? Interesting things happen.<BR>
If Softwood felt truly motivated, they could take their Final Writer printing technology, and adapt it 
slightly so as to become a full-featured, centralized print spooling system and postscript/graphic 
printing engine.  Then they could market that as an independent product that you could actually 
purchase and install as an extension to the Amiga OS, where it would be available to all programs 
seeking to use it.
<LI><B>Autoscroll Virtual Screen</B><BR>
Final Writer should be able to open on an autoscroll virtual screen, just as the Workbench can.  It 
would be very convenient, especially for those of us for whom resolutions higher than 640x480 are 
still a dream...
<LI><B>Iconification</B><BR>
The ability to iconify to an AppIcon on the Workbench is a powerful feature of the OS that is very 
much underused.  It seems as though MUI Apps are the only ones that use it fairly consistently.  Final 
Writer should incorporate this feature, so that its screen and other facilities could be shut down so as 
to conserve memory, if the user wished to set it aside without actually quitting the program.
<LI><B>AutoSave</B><BR>
It is good that Final Writer does have facilities to automatically save your work at certain preset 
intervals, but there's one flaw with them: again, I refer back to the old Amiga WordPerfect.  WP's 
autosave didn't save the file to the name you had given it; it saved to a file in the T directory (the one 
on disk, not in RAM:), and deleted it upon proper exit of the program; but if WP ran and found that file 
in T, it would know something had gone wrong, and recover it for you.  Final Writer, and most other 
current word processors, simply autosave right to the file from which they were loaded, or to which 
they were saved.  This is not as good as the other method for several reasons: if the file doesn't yet 
exist, you'll be asked for a name, and if you are viewing files (and not typing) and you happen to 
inadvertently make a change in the file, it will be saved periodically.  I would prefer to have it saving to 
some otherwise meaningless file in a scrap directory.
<LI><B>Datatype</B><BR>
Currently, the only program that can view a file created with Final Writer is Final Writer.  Softwood 
should include a datatype with Final Writer so that programs such as MultiView could read FW 
Documents; or if not that, at least a file viewer for FW Docs, the way DPaint came with an animation 
viewer.  There should be no need to run a 1-megabyte program just to read a file you wrote with it.
<LI><B>Key Shortcuts</B><BR>
Final Writer has done a decent job with key shortcuts, especially with default items (like "Print" and 
"Save" buttons) and user-configurable aspects of the program, but this could be carried further, with 
shorcuts for just about all functions and items in requesters.  MUI and Windows have done nicely in 
this respect, and although the Amiga is, and always shall be (until the "next big input device 
revolution" if such an event occurs) a primarily mouse-driven machine, key shortcuts can be 
extremely convenient, and should be implemented more thoroughly into all programs, Final Writer 
included.
<LI><B>Cancel Closing of Document</B><BR>
When you click the close gadget on a document window, if it isn't saved, it will ask you if you wish to 
Save, and  allows you to say "Yes," "No," or "Cancel." If you say "No," then there is no going back.  If 
it's the last document, the program asks you if you want to exit..."Yes" and "No," but no "Cancel." It is 
possible to make a mistake at the first requester.  If the user were allowed to "Cancel" the whole 
operation, then he or she would be given one more chance to preserve unsaved work.
<LI><B>Set File Type</B><BR>
For people who are frequently using Final Writer to edit documents other than those of the Final 
Writer variety (i.e.  RTF, ASCII, or HTML), it would be convenient if one could set the default file 
export type to something other than the standard format in preferences.  This is especially so for 
people who wish to repeatedly make minor edits to files and save them without having to go through 
all the requester options each time.  In this respect, the "ASL Requester" option is actually 
convenient, since it asks you to set the file format before it opens the requester when saving.  But if 
the default option could be set, it would make things that much easier.
<LI><B><I>Importing</I> Files</B><BR>
Final Writer, at this time, cannot import HTML documents.  They come up as ASCII text.  This would 
be a good capability to add in the future, since at this time, creating an HTML document with Final 
Writer is a one-shot deal.  It is understandable, however, why Softwood would add the export without 
import capabilty; there can be significant variation in HTML document structure.  It's meant that 
way...plus there is the issue of incomplete or badly-coded HTML documents.  So the HTML import 
driver would have to be extremely versatile.  But without going quite that far, they could at least give 
the ability to import HTML documents created with the Final Writer HTML export driver.  At least in 
that case they could be certain of a continuity in HTML coding.  But then by adding a thorough HTML 
import driver, we could be looking at full-featured web-browsing capability.  Hmm...imagine it..."Final 
Internet..." This whole idea certainly opens vast new gateways for Final Writer.  Integrated 
web-browsing abilty? Built-in email? Perhaps an entirely new Softwood product package could 
emerge based upon this first step into internet affairs.  Potentials abound!
<LI><B>HTML</B><BR>
The HTML driver built into Final Writer 5 is an excellent idea.  The growing popularity of the internet 
(and the growing number of people with web pages), in conjunction with Final Writer's long-standing 
history of being an excellent page-layout program, practically mandated that, and Softwood made a 
good decision.  But as I mentioned, the current HTML driver is highly limited, and a bit flaky.  Don't 
think I'm denouncing it; it's a great idea, and for that reason, is something that should be developed.  
Were Softwood to iron out the bugs and quirks, and expand the capabilities to include all the little 
HTML tricks and entities (tables, forms, links, protocols, etc.), Final Writer could be transformed into a 
fully-graphical, full-featured, and extremely easy-to-use HTML editor.  Some current features of the 
DTP side of the program could be "ported" to the HTML side, such as tables and horizontal rules.  At 
that, Final Writer could serve a multifaceted purpose and attract a larger crowd.
</UL>

<P>One final interesting detail of note is that the date stamped on the program in the "About..." menu 
item was AFTER the date I ordered it...;-)</P>
