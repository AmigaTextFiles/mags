ELSPA TACKLE PIRATES
- Changes in ELSPA anti-piracy policy has led senior FAST investigator John Loader to move in-house with the publishers' association. FAST is to continue its weight against corporate copying, but will retain links with ELSPA for consumer theft. An ELSPA crime unit number can be called direct to
pass on piracy information: 0386 830642.

SHOPPER SALES DOWN
- Latest ABC figures show a sharp drop in copies of some Future magazines. Amiga Shopper has fallen over 13% on last year, with sales now an average of 37,583 compared to 43,290 a year earlier. Amiga Format stays steady around the 142,000 mark, while Commodore Format and Amstrad Action show the biggest percentage fall both down 44% to 25,063 and 15,168 respectively.

SALES DOWN, PRICES UP
- Gallup has released its Q3&4 report on that state of the British games
market last year. It shows that unit sales fell by a fifth at shops taking part in its survey, but value increased by a tenth. The Mega Drive continues to lead sales with 33%, followed by the SNES on 19%, the Amiga falling from 18% to 13% and then the Game Boy on 9%. PCs have reached fifth spot with 7%.

PC ACTION TO CLOSE
- Europress Enterprise have taken aboard the Europress Interactive titles under its wing. PC Action is to close following a smaller-than-expected
market for games magazines.

GAME ON
- Middlesex University has confirmed that its MA degree in games development will go ahead this autumn, and are now also planning a three-year BA course.
Each student will be sponsored by a games company, take work experience and look at team development. Meanwhile Nintendo of America are offering SNES developer kits to the DigiPen Computer Graphics School for two-year courses.

BBS RAIDED
- ELSPA's anti-piracy unit and police have raided The Krypt BBS in Birmingham, taking 2,000 disks and computer equipment. John Loader told Computer Trade Weekly that the number of pirate boards operating in the UK has dropped from 40 to 25 since a similar raid in December.

MERCURY TAKES GAMES STAKE
- Mercury Communications has invested £3.75 million in multimedia publishers Andromeda and has established a division to investigate link-ups in technology and media.

GONNA BE A..
- Revolution Software of Hull have sold a quarter stake to Virgin Interactive Entertainment for over £1 million. Revolution specialises in adventures and produced Lure of the Temptress.

PRODUCT NAME

    Digital Breadboard 1.1.8


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

    This product is a computer engineering simulator.  It allows you
to build up combinational logic circuits on screen and test them.

    This product may be found in the file util/misc/dbb118.lha on
the Aminet ftp sites.

    Address:    2049 Tamarack Dr.
            Okemos, MI 48864
            USA

    E-mail:     griffin@egr.msu.edu


LIST PRICE

    Freeware.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

    HARDWARE

        Works on the 68030.

    SOFTWARE

        Requires AmigaDOS 2.04 and reqtools.library.

        "Degrader" is recommended because for some reason the
        program is in PAL.


COPY PROTECTION

    None.
    Installs on a hard drive.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    Amiga 3000 / 25
    10 meg ram (8 Fast, 2 Chip)
    Quantum 50 meg HD
    Quantum 425 meg HD
    Commodore 1950 monitor
    AmigaDOS 2.1


INSTALLATION

    Dearchive the files (using "lha" or similar program) into
a directory and you're set.  It makes its own subdirectory.


REVIEW

    I saw this announced in comp.sys.amiga.announce and I said to myself,
"I could really use a program like this."  I then downloaded it and tried to
use it.  It dearchived nicely into its own directory and was immediately
available to run.  After starting it the first time, I realized that I would
need to boot in PAL mode to see the bottom of the screen.

    Now after using the program for about 2 hours, I find that it is a
very good program for designing digital logic circuits.  I am currently
taking an Introduction to Computer Engineering course and I was easily able
to put examples from the book into the DBB and see them work.  There are
also some example circuits that are neat to see.

    Some of the features of this program include, in no particular order:

    - multiple user definable clocks
    - printing of circuit designs
    - various logic functions include 2 and 3 input
        - and
        - or
        - nand
        - nor
        - xor
        - inverters
    - input and output indicators
    - logic probes
    - various flip flops including
        - j/k
        - s/r
        - d
    - ARexx port (hmmmmm)
    - Many others that I cannot think of right now


DOCUMENTATION

    Documentation is online in AmigaGuide format.  You can also get
printed documentation from the Author for $5 (US).  Documents are also in
text and TeX formats.

    The documentation is of good quality.  However, it does not teach
digital logic design. You should take a class for this or buy a good book
from Radio Shack entitled "Getting into Electronics" for a start.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

    I think that I like the ability to test digital logic circuits
without having to wire them up on a real breadboard.  Also you don't have to
buy the chips to test them out:  you can just use the electronic ones.

    I dislike the distance that the elements must be separated by.  It
kind of limits the number of items you can put in.  Also there are only so
many different types of logic that you can make.  (and, nand, nor, etc.)  The
program could use some user definable logic functions (which the author
promises for the next version).

    I would like to see a variable sized grid on which the elements can
be placed, user definable logic functions, and a NTSC version.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    Compared to doing this kind of design by hand, this is great.  I
have not seen any other products with which to compare it.


BUGS

    I have not found any bugs.  This program runs smoothly.  I did
however crash the program once, but that is because I did not read all the
documentation.


VENDOR SUPPORT

    Not applicable.


WARRANTY

    No warranty is given (it's freeware, dammit).


CONCLUSIONS

    I think that this is a very good product.  I cannot wait for the
next version to be released.

    [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  This is a followup to the review of Digital
    Breadboard which was written by jhines@csugrad.cs.vt.edu and posted
    on 27 Mar 1994.  Dan Griffin is the author of Digital Breadboard.
    - Dan B]

    I'd like to point out a few errors in the recent review of Digital
Breadboard posted to c.s.a.reviews:

>"Degrader" is recommended because for some reason the program is in PAL.

Digital Breadboard does not force PAL mode:  it runs in NTSC or PAL.
However, it does create a screen with a height of 440 pixels, so a modest
overscan is recommended.  Version 1.2 has a resizable window.

>Some of the features of this program include, in no particular order:
>- ARexx port (hmmmmm)

This is only in version 1.2, which is still in development.  No ARexx port is
currently available.

>I have not found any bugs.

    One wire routing bug has been reported in v1.1.8.  v1.1.9 (file
"dbb119.lha") should be available on Aminet shortly.

        Optional: 3 1/2 mounting kit.

    SOFTWARE

        Insite drive unlock utility.(Available on aminet)
        Hard drive formating software.
        Workbench 1.3 minimum. (1.3 and 2.1 tested)


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    Amiga 2000, 1MB Chip RAM, 2MB Fast RAM.
    ECS Agnus chip.  OCS Denise chip.
    Commodore 2091 SCSI controller.
    Xetec FastTrack SCSI controller.
    AmigaDOS 1.3 / 2.1


INSTALLATION

    The Floptical drive will install in any 3 1/2 inch bay, but its
faceplate is standard PC size.

    Installation is the same as a hard drive with the following
exceptions:

    1. The drive is protected by a thin tin cover, so some care is
       necessary.

    2. The power plug is smaller than standard, and an adaptor is
       required.

    3. As it uses floppy disks, there has to be external access to the
       front panel.

    4. Insert the "insite" command early in the startup-sequence, but
       after "Binddrivers" and any other hard drive initialising
       software.

    As I received a bare drive, the SCSI address jumpering was a
hit-and-miss affair. I settled on address 4 after some experimentation.


REVIEW

    The first noticeable thing when booting with a Floptical is the time
it takes for the drive to check a disk.  It goes "clunk-clonk" and whirs a
bit, reminiscent of a sick floppy drive.  Both controllers take a bit of time
to notice the drive when booting as it doesn't respond for about 10-15
seconds.  This may cause problems with other controllers.

    Before you can do ANY writing to the drive, a utility is needed to
send a "write sense enable" to the drive.  Even low-level formatting cannot
be done without this utility.  There are two available on Aminet, the best
being "insite" (filename: insite.lha).  There is another called "scsi", and
they both do the job.  The command should be inserted in your
startup-sequence AFTER Binddrivers and any other controller enabling
commands.  (For example, "Touchall" for Xetec controllers.)

    HDTools has no problem with the floptical AFTER the "insite" utility
is run.  Low-level formatting takes about 20 minutes, and AmigaDOS format is
about the same, accompanied by a bit of clunking.  In the end, the disk has
19 Meg of usable space.

    The disk acts just like a hard drive, with the exception of the
write protect tab. This is the same as a floppy (on the opposite corner of
the disk) and can be used to protect the disk from ALL writing.  Write
protected flopticals can be booted from on a virus-infected system or if
something is trashing partitions (e.g., possibly some of the bugs in certain
UNIX versions).

    Under AmigaDOS 1.3, the DiskChange command must be run several times
when changing a disk.  This isn't necessary for AmigaDOS 2.0 and higher
because the computer polls the drive every 5 seconds:  similar to the floppy
interface, but without the annoying click.  The disk icon disappears and
reappears in an orderly fashion.  If there is no disk in the drive when
booting AmigaDOS 1.3, there will be a long delay until the controller
times-out waiting for a response from the floptical drive.  This is very
obvious with the 2091 SCSI controller.

    Disk changes sometimes require a reboot to take effect.  If the new
disk has exactly the same partitioning as the old one, then disks can be
changed without rebooting.  Of course, this is not a problem if all your
disks have only one partition.

    MessyDOS and CrossDOS can be used to read 1.44 MB PC disks.  This
requires a Mountlist entry and the appropriate software.  It can be done.  I
have not been able to format PC disks using a floptical though.


DOCUMENTATION

    I received a bare drive with NO documentation.  There are kits
available with all of this, which takes the guess-work out of the address
jumpering.  It's a SCSI device, so it shouldn't NEED much documentation.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

    LIKES

    1. The ability to store a reasonable amount of data with random
       access is what makes this product for me.  I have 40 Meg of
       archive files stored away and duplicated on 4 disks.

    2. Workbench fits on ONE disk. In fact several versions fit on one
       disk.

    3. Another aspect is disaster recovery.  All my important partitions
       are stored on a disk which I can boot from if the hard drive is
       killed.  The hard drive can be reformatted/partitioned (or
       replaced) and all the data transferred back.

    4. This could also be handy for UNIX users who could have a cut down
       system on 1 disk.  Rogue software can't blow away a write
       protected floptical disk!

    DISLIKES

    1. Initially the noise made by the drive was not to my liking.  I'm
       used to it now.

    2. The price of the disks!  Initially I was charged $80 (NZ) each.
       Since then I have found a source for 3M Floptical disks at the
       price mentioned in the LIST PRICE section, above.

    DESIRED IMPROVEMENTS

    1. Better Amiga support.

    2. BIGGER disks.

    3. A standard for the jumpers included in SCSI specifications, as
       this would make ANY drive simple to install.


BUGS

    The drive requires a utility to enable writing.  See above.


VENDOR SUPPORT

    For me this was MELCO Sales (Mitsubishi ELectric COmpany).  They were
very helpful and replaced the whole drive when I told them that it wouldn't
write.  Later on they replaced a disk after I had messed it up so bad that NO
controller could make sense of it. (The disk later formatted OK on one of
MELCO's PC's.)

    Their technicians know a lot about the drives and are able to repair
them. They will clean the drives too, as this can not be done buy the user.


WARNING!!!

    DO NOT CLEAN THE DRIVE WITH A CLEANING DISK.

    The drive will require less cleaning (and expense) if ONLY floptical
disks are used.


WARRANTY

    12 months.  This will probably vary.


CONCLUSIONS

    Apart from the fact that nobody from Commodore/MELCO/Insite was able
to give specific help for an Amiga setup, I really like this product.

    The drive has performed flawlessly since I have been using it.  To
date I have had NO faulty blocks on any disks, including those with games on
them.  Games disks have received a reasonable thrashing for over a year!

    The physical write protection can be used in the case of viruses and
experimental software to keep a reference disk free from interference. This
reference disk can even booted from while still write-protected.

    The Floptical beats a tape for access and convenience, but storage is
now small in comparison to other media (CD-ROM, DAT tape, and large hard
drives).

PRODUCT NAME

    ISDN Master rev.2, WilhelmTel V1.187


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

    This is the first board for Amiga that allows you to connect your
computer to an ISDN network.  It turns your Amiga into a powerful phone
answering machine and high-speed ISDN modem.

    WARNING:    Before using this product, be sure it complies with
            the FCC regulations in your country.  Also contact
            your phone company.

LIST PRICE

    About DM 900.00


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

    HARDWARE

        ISDN phone line (contact your phone company).
        Amiga 2000/3000/4000.
        Hard disk strongly recommended.
        Phone handset (not included) would be very useful.


    SOFTWARE

        AmigaDOS 2.0 or higher


COPY PROTECTION

    None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    Amiga 3000/25, 2MB Chip RAM, 8MB Fast RAM
    1 internal 880K floppy.
    1 Quantum 500 MB internal hard drive.
    2 Quantum 100 MB internal hard drives.
    1 Sony CD-ROM.
    AmigaDOS 3.1.


INSTALLATION

    Software installation is done with Commodore's Installer program.
It is very easy to install, and the installation script is very well
documented.  The version of the software in the box is 1.0, but there are
many patches available almost everywhere, or directly from BSC.

    The card is a bit hard to plug it in, as the dial does not fit in
the opening. You have to remove the guide for the card. The "jumpers" are
set for USA regulations - you may find in the manual the correct positions
for European standards.

    Once the software in installed, you have to set it to the network
type you're using. The board has been successfully tested in the USA, France,
Switzerland, Germany and Great Britain.  It might work in many other
different countries, although nobody has tested it.


WHAT IS ISDN ANYWAY??

    ISDN is to an analog phone line like what a CD is to an LP.  An ISDN
line has almost no line noise, and it allows you to transfer data at a much
higher rate than on regular analog lines.

    ISDN allows you to use, on a single line, a telephone, faxes (class
4 or lower), visual-conferences, high-speed data transfers, etc.


HOW DOES THIS WORK?

    (Note: This may slightly vary from country to country)

    ISDN allows you to transmit informations "digitally" instead of the
regular "analog" way.

    With each phone line, you get 10 different phone numbers. You may
set one different phone number per device connected to the network.  For
example, you may have a telephone, a fax, a BBS and an answering machine,
all on one line, without any conflict.

    ISDN lines may carry two communications at the same time.
Information is transmitted via two B-channels (binary) at 64 Kbits per
second each. There is also a D-channel (data) at 16 Kbits per second which
carries information such as Caller-ID, tax information, busy signal, etc...


THE HARDWARE

    In the box, there is one ZORRO II ISDN board, one printed manual,
one 3.5" disk, and a special wire to connect the card to ISDN.

    On the card, there are about ten chips (surface mounted), 7 jumpers,
two connectors for ISDN-IN and ISDN-OUT, one connector for a phone handset
(not included), a CINCH connector for Audio-in, and a dial to set the gain.


DIGITAL MODEM

    ISDN-MASTER does not allow you to connect on "regular" analog
modems, but you may connect to any other ISDN compatible device.  The
software supports X.75 and V.110 protocols.  X.75 goes up to 64000 baud
(!!), and V.110 goes up to 38400 baud!

    The "bscisdn.device" emulates a Hayes-compatible modem and may be
used as replacement for the "serial.device".  As there may be two
connections at the same time, one card has two "units".

    The transfer rates are around 7800 cps (tested with TERM 3.4) I also
tried to connect from unit 0 to unit 1 and make a transfer, and I got the
same results! There is NO CPU wait time!!


WILHELMTEL SOFTWARE

    I had to "borrow" my neighbour's handset to do this test.  The
software (WilhelmTel) is a commodity which loads when booting.  It contains
four "elements":

    - Digital Phone
    - Phonebook
    - Answering machine
    - Phone taxes


DIGITAL PHONE

    This software allows you to use your Amiga as a regular phone, with
many useful options, such as:

    - Seeing actual phone taxes.
    - Having two conversations at the same time.
    - Conference mode (you hear both callers, but they can't hear
      each other).
    - Mute with AUDIO-IN, allows you to play music to the callers
      directly from your HIFI.
    - Redial, Caller-ID, etc...


PHONEBOOK

    You may store the most frequent callers, so when they call you,
their name pops up instead of the phone number.  You may choose for each
entry if you want to hear the ring or not, or even to send a "busy" signal
for "unwanted" callers!!!


ANSWERING MACHINE

    This is the strong part of the software! You may record any
conversation, you may record the "welcome" message, you may even record one
personalized message per caller, etc...
The quality of the samplings are simply PER-FECT!!!

    The size of a sample is 8 Kbytes per second recorded!  You may
listen to the samples either with the handset or through the Amiga speakers.


PHONE TAXES

    Prints out a list of all incoming and outgoing calls, and prints the
total money spent.


CONFIGURATION FILES

    You may create your own "ringers."  You also may define a ringer and
a message per phone number, and even one special message if the disk is full.


DOCUMENTATION

    It comes with printed German manual and German AmigaGuide file.  The
guide is well done, although I couldn't understand much, but the printed
manual is not clear at all.

    The board is fairly easy to install and you won't need the manual
too much.


LIKES

    - FAST transfers without going down on CPU rates.
    - Phone/answering machine option.
    - Quality of samples.
    - Software really easy to use.
    - Mute with injecting an audio source.
    - Samples may be converted into IFF with a special software (not
      included).

DISLIKES

    - German manual, not complete.
    - The board is not approved by any phone company.
    - The answering machine software is not "programmable"
      (it will be soon...).
    - The software does not accept faxes or regular modem calls.


BUGS

    None - the software is still in BETA test and the programmers are
VERY friendly and help a lot.  Further BETA versions are available directly
from the authors as soon as they are released.


VENDOR SUPPORT

    VERY GOOD!  Everyone is friendly, they are helpful and they speak
English....


WARRANTY

    1 year


CONCLUSIONS

    A very good product. You've got to have it!

    When I ordered this card, I was expecting to get only an ISDN modem.
It came with this phone/answering machine software and I was really glad to
have it!

    ISDN is getting more and more popular, and not only for big
companies. With this card, just about anyone can connect to this wonderful
network. Make a step into the 21th century!

REVIEW

    The game is based on the movie Inner Space, where a miniature
spacecraft is travelling through the body of a human.


INTRO

    The Intro is most fascinating and extremely cleverly done.  As we go
to the Cyber*Tech corporation, we get a 3D look at the city and see some
common vehicles run by.  The next step is on top of the building where
security agents are waiting for the transport to arrive.  Incredible
graphics and stunning action give you the impression that you are looking at
a movie instead of a video game.


GAME

    The game starts in a vein.  The craft you're steering is simply
drawn.  The vein itself is very nicely done, like plasma.  On our way to the
control center we meet some body-habitants, which we must shoot down.

    With the help of a map (warning, the map is shown, but the action
will continue as you read it), we can determine our way out.  Different
weapons can be selected, but there's no noticeable clue on the screen!

    Shooting at those weird-looking objects at a rapid speed seems to be
the task here.  There's some interaction; for example, when a vein splits in
two we can actually choose to go right or left.  When completing the first
(still intro) level, you'll get the chance to enter at different locations,
e.g., left brain or right brain.  This will only show other aircrafts and
other vein-graphics.  The graphics in between all the action are superb.

    Although the gameplay is very difficult (you could be dead in
seconds), continuing the game to see some other levels is done some five
times.  Maybe there's more to come...


DOCUMENTATION

    Good.  Normal explanation of the world and vehicles. The parts of
the body you can enter are described.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

    I like the Intro very much, and the animations shown throughout the
game.  They show what a machine the CD32 really is.

    The game however is not so exciting as I thought it would be.  If the
Intro shows so many nice/neat animations, then the game itself could be
better.

    It would be best if this product had improved gameplay and maybe
some improvement on the interactivity, controlling the ship better.

    The most annoying part is the loading disk at the screen, so the
animation simply stopped or started.


BUGS

    None.


CONCLUSIONS

    Good.

    It's definitely a must-be-in-my-collection game.  Although the
gameplay isn't that exciting at all, the intro and animation make it all
better.

PRODUCT NAME

    Music-X 2.0 upgrade


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

    Music-X 2.0 is the long-awaited upgrade to the venerable Amiga MIDI
sequencer, Music-X.  It includes Notator-X, a new music notation program.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

    Name:       Hollyware Entertainment
    Address:    PO Box 9148
            Marina Del Ray, CA 90295

    Telephone:  (310) 822-9200
    FAX:        (310) 390-0457

    E-mail:     72662.1041@compuserve.com


LIST PRICE

    $199.95 for Music-X 2.0.  I have seen it advertised in Amiga
magazines for $129.95.  The upgrade is $100 and requires sending in your
original program and utilities disks.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

    HARDWARE

        MIDI interface and MIDI instruments strongly recommended for
        serious work.

        Memory requirements are minimal unless you want to work with
        lots of samples.  2 megs of Fast RAM should handle just about
        anything.

        A hard drive isn't necessary if you're patient.  No special
        CPU requirements.

    SOFTWARE

        The manual does not mention any special requirements.


COPY PROTECTION

    None.  Installs on a hard drive.


INSTALLATION

    Installs OK if you rewrite the Installer script.  It incorrectly
asks for the volume "Music-X 2.0" as the program disk when it should be
"Music-X2.0".


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    A3000/25, 2 megs Chip RAM, 8 megs Fast RAM
    50 meg Quantum internal hard drive
    40 meg Connor external hard drive
    Internal and external floppy drives
    Golden Hawk MIDI interface unit
    AmigaDOS 2.1 and 3.1 tested without difficulty


REVIEWER'S RELEVANT BACKGROUND

    I have been a professional musician for 12 years, and a Music-X 1.0
user for 3 years.  I use the sequencer primarily for theater soundtrack work.


REVIEW

    Acquiring this upgrade proved to be extremely frustrating. I haven't
yet tallied up the phone bill for all my calls to Hollyware trying to find
out why it was taking so long to ship; I don't think I want to know.
Suffice it to say that these people are masters of saying, "The check is in
the mail."  However, it *did* eventually arrive.

    The first thing I noticed once I opened the plain white box was the
194-page spiral-bound manual.  60 pages are devoted to Music-X, and 134 pages
describe the accompanying notation program NOTATOR-X.  The printing is poorly
done; screen shots are blocky, and the text is not particularly sharp.
Having never received the 1.1 upgrade, I cannot tell how much of the Music-X
information is new and specific to the 2.0 version; I have been told that
much of it is simply a reprint of 1.1 data.  The manual is terse at best;
it's more like a specification list than an instruction manual.  It does seem
to describe everything in the box, though.  (It even describes items that are
*not* in the box!  More on that later.)  I thought the original Music-X
documentation was some of the best I have seen for any Amiga software, so
this poorly printed booklet with its frequent misspellings and cloudy
grammar is a disappointment.

    It was immediately obvious that the upgrade as shipped is
incomplete.  No ARexx macros at all were supplied, although they are
described on pages 22 and 23 of the manual.  This renders the RexxEdit module
completely useless.  (RexxEdit is something of a misnomer, as the module has
nothing to do with editing.  It should be called the RexxExecute module.)
Additionally, no PrintEvents module was supplied either.  Since the ARexx
macros and the PrintEvents module were significant reasons for my decision
to purchase the upgrade (and both were specifically mentioned in Hollyware's
press releases and in the manual), this is clearly a problem.  In my many
phone calls to the company, I was also told by its president that there was a
protocol for the Yamaha SY55 included with the upgrade, but that too was
missing.  I noted with some surprise that a librarian for the Roland GR-1
guitar synth was included (I have one of these), but it seems to be capable
of storing only one patch at a time.  Since the GR1 is quite easy to send
bulk dumps to, while it has no provision for single voice dumps, I found this
perplexing.

    What is Music-X 2.0 like?  First, this is plainly a minor upgrade and
not a major change from version 1.1.  Let me quote from E-mail I received
from David Joiner, the programmer of Music-X:

  >     Music-X 2.0 is basically a bunch of features that I put in
  >for my own use. Anyway, I traded this new version to Hollyware
  >(who bought the defunct MicroIllusions) in return to some of the
  >rights to my other products. I don't know what their plans are.
  >Unfortunately, I'm in the middle of a killer project at the
  >moment and I don't have time to work on Music-X. (If I were
  >seriously going to work on Music-X, I'd throw all the code away
  >and start over from scratch).

    This should speak volumes.

    The interface hasn't changed at all; there's no support for overscan
screens, still no more than 9 sequences displayed at once on the main page,
no ASL file requester (although it is nicer than the old 1.0 requester...
damning with faint praise indeed), and no possibility of placing comments on
the sequences.  On the other hand, the program is stable as a rock; I have
yet to see it crash on my 3000, and the SUSPEND option works as it should,
allowing me to use my communications program without rebooting.  (Music-X 1.0
failed to release the serial device when exiting.)  There is a reworked
Quantizer module which adds a bit more fine tuning to the old one, a swing
module that allows the imposition of a dotted-note feel, and a new Selector
module that is extremely useful for doing things like remapping a drum
track.  A Scatter module allows you to introduce random elements in the
timing in an attempt to "de-quantize" rigid tracks; like most devices of its
kind, it is of marginal use if you want it to sound like a human played the
music.  The PrintEvents module ballyhooed in the advance PR is missing.

    Music-X now offers better control over Amiga samples, but as I don't
normally use them, I can't really comment on the changes.  I did notice that
the new panning option does not seem entirely reliable.  Overlapping notes
often go to the other channel.

    The most significant addition to Music-X (potentially, at least) is
the ability to have multiple MIDI ports.  Unfortunately, this requires
multiple serial cards with custom drivers; Hollyware supplies only a driver
for the Blue Ribbon One Stop Music Shop and the Checkpoint serial card (no
longer manufactured).  I asked the president of the company about getting a
driver for the MultiFaceIII, but he didn't know what it was and I have very
little hope that Hollyware will ever release *any* other drivers, so this
feature is useless at the moment unless you have a One Stop Music Shop. (In
that case, you will only get multiple MIDI outputs, since the One Stop Music
Shop doesn't *have* multiple inputs.)


COMPARISON TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    Those who have already used Bars & Pipes (B&P) already have their own
opinion.  I don't like B&P at all; I think it was written by non-musicians
for people who don't play real-time music, but who enjoy playing with tools.
Music-X functions for me like a multi-track tape deck whose tracks I can
edit later, its file size (both the executable and the performance files) is
quite economical, and its user interface uses color better than any other
sequencer I've encountered.  It has logical keyboard equivalents that are
easy to remember.  It is also very stable.

    The Mac has better sequencer software available, but it comes at a
hefty cost and there are some things you still can't do with some Mac
software.  (Try selecting discontiguous information in Master Trax Pro, for
example.)  On the other hand, Macs have built-in multiple MIDI port
capability without this nonsense of custom serial card drivers.

VENDOR SUPPORT

    I think the word I want is "nonexistent," but I'd like to see them
prove me wrong.  I have made so many phone calls to this company that my wife
is asking me about our phone bill; about fifty per cent of the time I get an
answering machine, about forty per cent I get the secretary (Lisa is very
nice, but she's not capable of answering technical questions or of making
management decisions such as "Yes, we will send you all the missing stuff
right away."), and maybe ten per cent of the time I get somebody else.
Exactly once, someone returned one of my machine messages; it took nearly two
weeks and it was Lisa who made the call. She wanted to know if someone had
ever gotten back to me.

A WORD ABOUT NOTATOR-X

    This program should not have been released.  It has so many problems
that a complete review would be a waste of time, and I have wasted enough on
it simply by trying to use it already.  Do not use this program unless you
enjoy looking at letters that don't fit where they are supposed to go on the
screen, rebooting the computer each time you try to abort a printout, or if
you think a music notation program should support any fonts (or point sizes)
other than the one supplied with the program.  Stick to Deluxe Music, or
better yet, switch platforms if you want real music notation software; it
simply is not available yet on the Amiga.


BUGS
    This version of Music-X seems quite bug-free.  It's the *company*
that's buggy.


WARRANTY

    If you receive a faulty disk Hollyware will replace it free for
ninety days.  After that they will replace the disk for $5.00.


WANT LIST

    I would really like to see some sort of level mixdown feature added.
Even B&P has automated mixing these days, but to Music-X the term "fade"
means "scale velocity" which is silly.  ARexx macros that deal with volume
levels would be nice too, but then at this point *any* ARexx macros would be
nice.  Music-X should support different screen modes and resize itself
accordingly so you can see more sequences than the nine allowed by the HiRes
Amiga display.


CONCLUSIONS

    This is basically a very good product, but as it is shipped it is an
incomplete one.  Music-X is reliable; but without the advertised ARexx
macros, the PrintEvents module, and the librarian/protocol additions, the
shipped product simply is not the one Hollyware is advertising.  Music-X 2.0
be considered a bug-fix only and not a new release, and the addition of the
highly buggy Notator-X should require monetary payment by Hollyware to the
user.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

    Oktagon 2008 is a SCSI-2 controller card with up to 8MB of RAM for
the Amiga 2000/3000(T)/4000 models of personal computers.  The card also
functions as a hard card, with supplied mounting hardware.

    Name:           BSC Broautomation AG
    Address:        Lerchenstraae 5
            80995 Mnchen 50

    FAX:            ++49/89/357130-99

    E-mail:         None given, although I suspect that there is one.


LIST PRICE

    I do not know the list price of the product, but I paid $129.95 (US)
from my local Amiga dealer in Portland, OR, USA.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

    HARDWARE

        A SCSI-1/SCSI-2 3.5-inch or 2.5-inch form factor hard drive
        is required for operation. I have installed a Quantum 1080
        Empire SCSI-2 hard drive on my controller card.

        No RAM is required on the card for operation, but ZIP style
        sockets provide for up to 8MB of Fast RAM. 1X4 ZIP chips in
        groups of four, either Static Column or Page Mode, are
        supported.

        All sizes of hard drives are supported, as long as they
        are as I described previously.

        The card is processor independent for compatibility, but
        a faster CPU probably means faster speed.

        Supports all current Motorola CPU's including the 68040.

    SOFTWARE

        The Oktagon comes with its own HD toolbox, on a single,
        autobooting, double-sided, double-density 720K floppy disk.

        Surprisingly, it works with all revisions of the AmigaDOS.
        All features are implemented with the latest revision of the
        OS, while some selections are ghosted out for older
        revisions (like AmigaDOS 1.3 and below).

        Full functionality is obtained with AmigaDOS 2.1 and above,
        yet even though compatible with AmigaDOS 3.0, it doesn't
        seem to take advantage of any of the newer features present
        in 3.0 as far as I know.  As the Oktagon is a Zorro II card,
        this may be the reason for this decision.


COPY PROTECTION

    None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    Amiga 2500 (rev 4.5)
    2 MB Chip RAM, 4 MB Fast RAM
    Kickstart version 37.300, Workbench version 38.35 (AmigaDOS 2.1).

INSTALLATION

    Installation is simple, as the Commodore Installer software is
used.  I selected the "Expert" mode, and found most of the defaults to be
standard, so even the "Novice" mode wouldn't be much different. You can even
choose the language in which the installation will occur (English is the
default, while French and German are supported), and if you have AmigaDOS
2.1 or above, locales are also supported. The Amiga Style Guide is completely
supported throughout the entire installation process.


REVIEW

    The Oktagon 2008 is a SCSI 1 and SCSI 2 host adapter for the Amiga
2000 family of computers, and supports the A3000T, and the A4000 as well.
The card is packaged quite securely, and comes with the mounting hardware
for the drive, a short, but easily installable 50 pin ribbon cable, and a
power cable.

    The documentation is written in a "German first, English second"
booklet labeled "Harddisk Controllers & HD Installation Tools". It was well
written, and includes both a step-by-step and expert installation
description. Throughout the book were suggestions, warnings, and helpful
tips about hard drive installation, use, and maintenance.

    After I assembled the hard card, and powered up my A2500, the
installation software had an automatic mode by default (which I don't
recommend, unless you want one single partition), or can be changed to
manual mode (for creating multiple partitions). After selecting the
appropriate mode, you can set the number and size of partitions by using the
intuitive editor. One caveat here, though, is that you must specify the size
of the partitions in blocks, so a calculator is handy.

    Once the size and number of each of the partition(s) are set, then
you have to format each using the AmigaDOS "Format" command from a gadget
tool on the requester.  Depending on the size of your drive, this can take
quite a while for large drives, and seems more like formatting a large
floppy than a hard drive.

    After formatting your partition(s), you can either install AmigaDOS
(for which there appears to be no utility included), or restore from your
favorite backup program.  One nice feature is the ability to update the
AmigaDOS type through the corresponding utility. You can also save the RDB
contents to a file on a floppy should disaster strike, like a corrupted RDB
sector.

    All in all, this is a fine product from a supportive and growing
company, and I would highly recommend getting the card if you are in the
market for a fast and inexpensive host adapter.


DOCUMENTATION

    The printed documentation comes in a 136-page, perfect bound
booklet, with the first half in German, the second in English. My
congratulations to the writers for the excellent translation and low
spelling error count. The docs are very straightforward, and cover every
aspect of installation, use, and maintenance. All levels of expertise are
covered, and beginners to experts alike won't be disappointed or confused by
the nomenclature.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

    I like the ease of use, the intuitive system that is completely
style guide compliant, and the use of many of the advanced features found on
the more recent AmigaDOS upgrades.

    About the only dislike I had was that in order to properly partition
off the hard drive, I had to enter the number of blocks manually. This
requires a calculator, or figuring out manually the size of the partition(s)
in blocks, rather than using the sliding type of gadgets found on other,
more intuitive installation tools, like Commodore's HD Tools.  My suggestion
to BSC: dump the manual entry of partition block size, and use sliding
gadgets with a readout of partition(s) size in megabytes.

    One surprise was the inclusion of the program GigaMem. This virtual
memory manager is included in the startup disk supplied, and includes the
documentation, but not the registration. I will give a review of GigaMem
v3.0 in a later installment, after fully testing and evaluating it. As it
sells for $79.95 (US funds) at my local Amiga dealer, it makes for the
frosting on the cake, so to speak.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    I have owned three hard drive controllers and three hard drives in
the past several years, and the Oktagon compares quite favorably. As it
stands, it's easily the fastest and most compatible of the three controllers
I have owned. Unlike previous products, this one was up and running in less
than half an hour, which by my previous experience is a record. The external
25 pin SCSI connector is also a plus, and has provision for both snap-in and
screw-in connectors, while past controllers used only one or the other.

BUGS

    None noted.


VENDOR SUPPORT

    Full addresses and phone/fax numbers are supplied, but the hotline
for technical support is sent back only after registration card is received
by BSC. I am not associated with the vendor in any way other than being a
satisfied customer of BSC/Alfa Data.


WARRANTY

    Full one year warranty on parts, and the installation software.
Warranty appears to be transferrable, as no mention is made about the
transfer of title to warranted merchandise.


CONCLUSIONS

    This is an excellent product at a fair price.  Considering the
performance capabilities exhibited, I would hazard a guess that the faster
your machine, the faster the throughput. According to SysInfo 3.14, I get
2.5 MB/sec reads, and 2.48 MB/sec writes.  Diskspeed 4.2 also gave very high
marks, and I will UUencode the tabulated results to anyone with a valid
E-mail address, if requested. Seek speed showed my drive had seeks of about
6 ms from beginning to end of each partition, and 2 ms average seek from
adjacent tracks, and 4 ms for 8 random seeks on 90 percent of the drive. It
would appear that faster processors coupled with faster drives will produce
the best results, naturally enough, but faster than your average comparable
equipped host adapter. I'd give BSC and Alpha Data (the manufacturers) a
rating of 4+ stars out of 5, and a full five stars if they make the
appropriate changes to the partitioning software.

PRODUCT NAME

    Real 3D Version 2.0 (version 2.35)


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

    Real 3D V2.0 is the newest Real 3D ray tracing and animation
program.  Among its fanciest features are: inverse kinematics, collision
detection, built-in Forth-like language, depth of field, motion blur, macro
recording, user-configurable interface, and multitasking with some of its own
functions.

    In this review, I would like to remind all those who read it that a
new version -- Real 3D Version 2.4 -- is already out and there have been
quite a few addition and changes.  I am waiting for that one to show up real
soon now ;-) in my mailbox.

SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

    HARDWARE

        3 MB RAM required.
        5 MB hard disk space required.
        68020 or faster processor required, with FPU.

        My experience shows that you probably will need at least 10
        megs of RAM and a 68030 @ 25Mhz with a 25MHz FPU.  My system
        has 16 megs Fast RAM plus a 68030 @ 50Mhz with a 50Mhz 68882.

    SOFTWARE

        AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher required.


COPY PROTECTION

    Dongle (hardware device attached to an Amiga port).  It is not
pass-through.

    I rate their copy protection as acceptable.  People that use the GVP
G-lock, Brilliance, Scala or any other 'dongle' program might have to
manually switch dongles and connections. :-(


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    Amiga 1200
    CSA '12 Gauge accelerator 68030 @ 50Mhz with 50Mhz 68882 FPU
    16 Megs Fast RAM
    2 Meg Chip RAM
    200 Meg IDE hard disk


INSTALLATION


    Installation is easy.  RealSoft uses the Commodore's Installer
utility.  The only change is that users with '040 equipped Amigas will have
to rename two files.


REVIEW

    Real 3D V2 (called "Real 3D" from now on) is the latest incarnation
of the 'Real 3D' family of programs that boasts new features and
capabilities.  Real 3D relies heavily on CSG (constructive solid geometry)
objects.  These are 'primitives' like a sphere, cube, cone, ellipsoid,
polygon, pyramid, cylinder, etc.

    There are several advantages in using these primitives.  First, all
primitives use their 'highest resolution' whether you are close to them or
not in the virtual world.  Usually in other 3D programs, you have to
subdivide your object into a lot of polygons to achieve a smooth effect.  Not
so with Real 3D.

    Second, I have found that the Real 3D primitives are to '3D
construction' what Bezier curves are to 2D drawing.  If one had to model an
object with polygons like the primitives found in Real 3D, it would be a lot
of work.

    Third, the modeling screens get less cluttered.  I remember in
Imagine, if you load the 'ship' object, the computer is redrawing all the
polygon information for that object in wire frame.  Although this problem in
Imagine can be partially avoided, it is still more cumbersome than in Real
3D.

    Finally, since Real 3D supports boolean operations among primitives,
this almost ensures that with those primitives you can model 'almost
everything.'  Consider, for example, a crystal ball on top of a cone-shaped
crystal ball holder.  You could model the crystal ball holder by 'cutting
off' from the holder a sphere which is the same size as the crystal ball.
You will effectively have cut a spherical shape out of a cone-shaped
primitive.

    Real 3D also makes use of splines and spline meshes, which are lines
and three dimensional surfaces composed of 'Bezier type' curves like those
used in Professional Draw or Art Expression.  The advantage of using splines
is that all objects always look very detailed and curved, unlike in polygon
based programs like Imagine, Aladdin, etc.  The disadvantage is that splines
are really sloooooooooooooooooooow to render, although there are several
optimizations you can do for speeding those up.


PROGRAM MENUS

    The program has eight main menus with options that usually have
submenus:

    1. Project:  deals with saving, loading (inserting or replacing)
objects, materials, named colors, and 'environments.' Also deals with opening
different types of windows like the Tools, View and Select windows.

    2. Create:  allows you to create any primitive that Real 3D
supports, splines, spline meshes, compound objects (objects that are
created from primitives), freeform (objects built from spline curves),
tree and terrain type fractals, and boolean operations.

    3. Modify:  provides for object modification.  Real 3D classifies
the different modifications you can do in categories such as linear
modifications, structure, properties (color, names, size, velocity, etc.),
non-linear (used for altering freeforms), freeforms (also used for altering
freeforms) and others.

    4. View:  selects type of view (perspective or parallel), switches
left, front and above views, has an option for creating a camera, grid
options, bounding boxes for rendering, zoom options.

    5. Animate:  has shortcuts for creating some animations.  Usually
animations have to be created by creating a level, and setting the target
objects and the parameters.  This menu allows for setting automatically all
these structures for some common animation types.  Also has some animation
VCR-like controls like go forward, go backwards, jump to a specific frame,
etc.

    6. Extras:  accesses the vector calculator, undo, statistics (more
like an 'about' option), etc.

    7. Settings:  general preferences like the different paths where to
find the objects, materials, etc., levels of undo, default primitive object
attributes and other things.

    8. Tools:  displaying specific types of tools in the tools window,
and creation of user defined buttons with text that also appear on the tools
window.


PROGRAM WINDOWS

    When you start Real 3D, unless you started from one of the
predefined environments, it will boot up in a hi-res non-interlaced
(640x200) screen.  By default it opens three windows:  a view window, a
select window and a tools window.

    Each type of window serves a different purpose.  For example, the
view window is where you manipulate and view the objects and your scene.
The select window is where you select objects to be manipulated and where
you can 'walk' through the object hierarchy.  Finally the tools window has
icons that you can click on for object operations (like move, stretch,
etc.), color, name, create primitives, lights, etc.

    The 'world' in Real 3D is organized hierarchically.  This is very
similar to a computer science 'tree structure.' For example, when you start
the program you are at a 'level.' All objects that you create are at this
same level.  You can also create other levels and objects 'beneath them.'

    For example, let's say that we are creating a scene where we have a
single three-leg table in our 'universe.' We have the following hierarchy:

    level--Table--Table_Top
              --Table_Legs----Leg_1
                        ----Leg_2
                        ----Leg_3

    We see that we got three different levels: level (the root level),
Table and Table_Legs.  Table_Top and Leg_1, Leg_2, Leg_3 are actual
geometric objects.  In Real 3D, the levels are objects too.  This means that
if for example, we wanted to move, stretch or rotate the table, we select
the table level and do the proper operation.  The operation is applied to
all the objects and levels underneath the Table level.  This means that we
can duplicate or delete the Table level effectively creating another table
or deleting the whole table altogether.

    You can enter, exit, and 'walk through' the whole hierarchy by double
clicking on the levels on the select window.  You can also render the
hierarchy from a current level and downwards in the current view window
using a 'render hierarchy' option.

    The hierarchy concept is also important when applying material
properties.  Material properties affect all objects at the current level, and
if these objects are levels, the effect carries further down those levels.
For example, if we wanted to put a metal textures on the legs and a wood
texture on the table top, we need to create another level and put the table
top underneath it.  At the same level of the table top, we create a wood
texture.  If we just created the wood texture at the same level of the
Table_Legs level and Table_Top object, the Table_Top would look wooden but
the legs will also look wooden.  If we created a metal type texture at the
legs level, then both textures (wood and metal) will be mixed!


MATERIALS

    Materials in Real 3D are also considered objects.  This means that
they can be manipulated in most cases like any other three dimensional
object.  Materials can be morphed, moved, animated, etc.

    The Materials have the normal 'classic' attributes like color, bump
mapping, brilliance (also known as reflection) mapping, transparency
mapping, specularity control, refraction, roughness, dither, bump height and
others.  The more unusual attributes include effect (like the effect of this
material on the object), clip mapping (makes parts it touches visible and
other parts invisible), scope mapping (makes the materials affect the region
covered by the material only), spline mapping (maps along the surface of a
spline mesh), and others.

    There is provision for procedural textures, although a bit limited
in this version (version 2.35).  It's actually not limited in the sense that
they are programmable in RPL (Real 3D Procedural Language), and there are
some presets, but it's harder and slower than say, Imagine.  The 'procedural
settings' are mapping, scope, bump, color and the index (when applying a
sequence of bitmaps, as in mapping a TV screen sequence animation).


ANIMATION

    Real 3D has twenty-two different animation methods.  This methods
can be combined with others hierarchically to make very complex animations.
The most notable (or say, those that impressed me the most) are:  direction,
inverse kinematics, radial forces, directed forces, tangent forces,
collision (there are two types), friction and creation.

    Direction is just the typical 'path' type method of animation with
the notable exception that it rotates the objects it affects along that
path.  There is a very good example of this in one of the tutorials of the
book where they make a swimming fish.  Its body bends along the path.

    With inverse kinematics you can make some skeleton type object
animations look a bit more realistic without a lot of work.  Consider for
example, the arm of a human person that is bent and has to reach out for the
light switch on the wall to turn the lights off.  With Real 3D, all you do is
use the inverse kinematics method and say that the index finger of the hand
has to travel to reach the switch.  When you animate, Real 3D calculates
automatically the way the arm stretches to read out and turn the lights
off.  Even if the finger has to stretch out, it will do it.

    The radial, directed and tangent forces mean what they sound like:
very useful for simulating molecule attraction/repulsions, satellites in
orbit around a planet (radial); gravity, wind (directed); and centrifugal
forces (tangent).  There are different variations of these animation
methods; so for example, you can write a formula in RPL that attracts
objects, but if they get too close, repels them.  You can simulate 'stormy'
wind by either writing an RPL formula or drawing a 'crazy' curve as a
parameter for the directed force method.

    Collisions can be used for simulating real-world Newtonian physics
collision phenomena.  Momentum is conserved, and there are some parameters
like the friction and elasticity of the collision, so colliding objects can
totally rebound or stick to one another or spin when colliding.

    Finally, collisions can also be used whenever you need objects to
bounce, or 'take into account' other objects when moving: for example,
dropping a ball down a curved tube.  There is an example in the manual where
this is done, and it works quite well.  Sometimes though, if objects are
small and are travelling too fast, they can 'pass through' the other
objects.  To avoid this, you can either make the objects a bit thicker if
they are too thin, or you can alter the 'sampling' accuracy of Real 3D for
collision calculation.  This however makes Real 3D slower.  I have found
that the collision works quite reasonable by just increasing the accuracy
one 'scale' up.

    The friction animation method helps simulate real-world friction
phenomena, such as a falling object in the wind.  By default, the program
takes into consideration the mass, size and speed of the object in order to
calculate the magnitude of the opposing force for the moving object(s).  If
an object is bigger, friction affects it more, and same with the speed.  If
the object is heavier, it is affected less.  Speed, by default, has the
biggest influence on the objects final speed (sounds recursive ;-) ).

    Creation is, in my opinion, one of the 'weirdest' animation methods
but very powerful.  It can create new objects during an animation,
controlling the process of 'birth and death' of the objects.  The copies it
makes are inserted on the same hierarchy level with the method itself, so
that they will be subject to the method.  For example, you can create a
sphere that follows a path, leaving copies of itself behind.  Since Real 3D
has a strong hierarchical concept of the property of objects, you can even
leave copies of the sphere on the previous example that have all the
properties of the original sphere including possible animation motions.

    The generated objects have a configurable 'life', so when objects
are created, then can be made to 'live' for a certain amount of time and
then 'die' or disappear.  The is a very good example of this in the book
where boiling water is simulated: bubbles start appearing at the bottom,
then more and more, and when they reach the top of the water they disappear.

    There are other methods of animation like the typical path,
rotation, stretch, size and a few others.  Since in Real 3D animation
methods are also objects themselves, they can be affected by other animation
methods too.


DOCUMENTATION

    The documentation comes in the form of a big manual and a README
file on disk.  Also, there's extensive AmigaGuide online help for particular
areas like materials and animation.

    The manual is quite helpful with its tutorials, and is relevant to
both the beginner and the power user.  There are some things, however, that
could be better explained, like scoping in the materials (making the
materials affect a particular part of a 3D object).  I would like to see a
new manual section full of hints and tips.

    Overall, the documentation gets an 8 out of 10, which is not bad.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

    Among the things that I like the most are the rich set of 3D
primitives and boolean operations.  You can make quite complex objects made
of just primitives, and these primitives are both fast (relatively speaking)
and very good for modeling.

    The animation system with its inverse kinematics and collision
detection is also a part of Real 3D that I like, since you can make quite
interesting animations that way.

    Finally, I like the extensive Real 3D procedural language support,
since it is very good for scripted animations, and offers a lot of control
over the real 3D environment.

    I disliked some parts of the animation system, particularly where
key framing and keeping track of 'time' is concerned.  Time is always from 0
to 1, so if you want to make (say) a car bump with another in 5 seconds,
you'll have to calculate from the total length of the animation when will
that happen, by dividing 5/(total time) in seconds.

    Among the other things I didn't like much was the very sloooow
rendering of spline meshes (although understandable), and lack of spotlights
(added in the new 2.4 version).  There are also a couple of bugs associated
with fractal trees and landscapes, where the machine can crash easily
generating a complex fractal.

    I would like Real 3D to be faster, more memory efficient, have more
built-in procedural materials, key framing and spotlights (added in the
newest release).


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    I have some experience with Imagine 2.0, so a comparison is
inevitable ;-).  Basically, Imagine's strongest points are that it provides
key framing, spotlights, lots of procedural textures and mathematical
animation transformations.

    Key frames are part of Imagine, where it has a 'cycle' editor just
to edit animations of individual objects that will have a certain animated
structure.  In this category you can add things like a walking human, robot,
animal, etc.

    Spotlights are native to Imagine, so if you want a 'cylindrical
light' or 'cone light', you can just make one specifying how long it will be
and the radius of the circle if it hits a surface at a certain default
distance.  In Real 3D, you will have to put a light source inside a cone or
cylinder, and render with the maximum quality (the slowest one) to achieve
the same effect.  It's simply unnecessarily harder, but fortunately this
feature be in the upcoming version 2.4 which should be out by the time you
read this.

    Procedural textures, like I said before, are more limited in variety
in Real 3D, and to make them requires a lot of knowledge.  Imagine comes with
a decent variety of high quality procedural textures, but to make one
requires even a greater knowledge -- C programming and Imagine interfacing, I
suppose.

    Finally Imagine has a couple of animation mathematical
transformations that manipulate the polygons of objects.  The most useful
are fireworks and explosions.  This means that you can have an object just
suddenly explode in a bunch of polygons quite easily, whereas in Real 3D you
will probably need to construct a complex object and then make a collision
type animation to make an exploding object.  In Real 3D, while being slower
to create and render, it will be more flexible and accurate, however.


BUGS

    Like I said before, Real 3D version 2.35 has some bugs, particularly
in the fractal generator for trees and mesh spline landscapes.  Also when
zooming in, sometimes changing views makes the objects appear like a thin
line -- and in three situations caused my machine to crash.  This last bug,
however, is not very common.

    Real 3D's creators are very committed to making Real 3D a successful
product.  Since its introduction, there have been at least 3 free upgrades,
and there's a major upgrade that should be around by the time you read this:
version 2.4.


VENDOR SUPPORT

    I contacted Godfrey and Associates for the purchase of Real 3D by
phone, and later I sent to them a money order.  I have had no problems with
them, and they seem very helpful.

    I am not associated with them in any respect except as a customer.


WARRANTY


    Typical 30 day disk warranty (disks replaced by new ones if they are
bad).  I don't know if the warranty applies only to the original purchaser.


CONCLUSIONS

    I love Real 3D.  It is quite a departure from typical 3D type
programs, but it is quite powerful once you grasp its basic concepts.  I
love its constructive solid geometry primitives, as it allows you to create
complex models easily and quickly and not take years to draw in wire
frame. ;-)

    On a scale of 1 to 10, I give Real 3D a 9.  Its RPL language support
provides for a lot of flexibility as its collision animation system.  There
are things that I would like to see, but most of those things will be in the
upcoming V 2.4 (2.47?) version, so I won't complain that much. ;-)


REAL 3D REVIEW PICTURES DESCRIPTION:

    Thanks to Dan Barrett and his awesome BLAZEMONGER company, there
will be a couple of Real 3D JPEG format images that I have made that will be
ftp downloadable as a supplement to this review.  Some of those JPEG images
have been made just for this review, while others have been made just for fun
while I have been learning this program.

    [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  These images are located on our ftp site,
    math.uh.edu, in the directory

        /pub/Amiga/comp.sys.amiga.reviews/software/graphics/raist

    When downloading these pictures, make sure to set your ftp connection
    to BINARY mode by typing "bin" at the "ftp>" prompt.

    - Dan]


The images are:

1. cowboy.jpg - a spline object generated with Real 3D.  This object is not
one that I made - comes with the program.  Check out how smooth it is,
although I know it is all gray.  The banding in the shading could be due to
the fact that I didn't use any dithering and the intensity of the brightness
I set.

2. glass.jpg - shows glasses and mirrors in Real 3D.  The 'glass pyramid
primitive' is actually a pyramid primitive composed with a glass-like
material applied to it.

3. lamp.jpg - a room and a lamp I made.  The texture is a 24-bit Epson
scanned Philippines postcard.  Please note the smooth shadow of the texture
and the mirror-like surface of the lamp.  The lamp cone was made with a
bumpmap.

4. mandm.jpg - M&M's (TM) candy in a 3D world. ;-)  Please note the depth of
field Real 3D feature - the M&M (TM) in the center are focused, and those in
the background are a bit out of focus.

5. poolcoll.jpg - a collision detection type animation showing balls
colliding in a pool table.  Actually just four frames from that animation
labeled in the upper left corner.  The white ball was thrown with a bit of
motion blur at the others, and Real 3D calculated the other motions.  I would
like to point out that those frames where originally generated in Real 3D
windows in HAM8, and that the quality can be far better when you render
first to iff 24-bit files and then convert that to HAM8.  This is because
the version 2.35 of Real 3D doesn't calculate the HAM8 base colors very
well, but this will be enhanced in the next upgrade.

6. r3di1.jpg - interface of Real 3D in a HAM8 screen showing the M&M's
(TM) project to make the mandm.jpg picture.

7. r3di2.jpg - interface of Real 3D in a HAM8 screen showing the M&M's
(TM) project object hierarchy in a window that Real 3D can render for
you.

8. r3di3.jpg - interface of Real 3D in a HAM8 screen showing the
material creation/modification window.

9. r3di4.jpg - interface of Real 3D in a HAM8 screen showing the
rendering settings window.

10. r3di5.jpg - animation interface screen of Real 3D.

11. redglass.jpg - a red glass in a checkered floor with a light source in
the left part of the screen.  Note how the light color changes when it goes
through the glass.

12. seatest.jpg - one of my failed ;-) attempts at doing a sunset in the
sea.  I have to improve it because it looks too mathematical but having
seagulls silhouettes over the sun and a sailboat in the horizon must surely
help - and I didn't make them. :-(

13. thecity.jpg - a city I was building in Real 3D.  To the left part you
can see a 'billboard' that needs a bit of detail to get more similar to an
actual billboard.  I hope you like the buildings.... ;-)

    Please remember that all the above pictures were JPEG compressed;
thus, they could lose a bit of quality even with JPEG at 100% quality (I
noticed that it happened with the redglass.jpg).  Some images my need more
brightness.


LAST NOTE FROM ME ;-)

    As I would like to improve, I welcome any comments about my review

    FAX:        02-819-7737


LIST PRICE

    I am unaware of the list price.  I bought Warlords from Software
Support for $34.99 (US).


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

    HARDWARE

        One megabyte of RAM required.
    
        Warlords installs on a hard drive, and requires 1.5 megabytes
        of free drive space.

        Warlords works fine with a 68030.

    SOFTWARE
    
        No special requirements.  Warlords worked fine on an Amiga
        3000 running Workbench 2.1 and Kickstart 2.04.  It is
        reported to run properly under 1.3, as well.


COPY PROTECTION

    None.  The two floppy disks are not copy-protected.
    Warlords installed on my hard drive without any difficulty.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

    Amiga 3000/25, 4 MB Fast RAM, 1 MB Chip RAM.
    1 internal 880K floppy, 1 external 880K floppy.
    Maxtor 120MB internal hard drive.
    Quantum 1.2GB external hard drive (Warlords was installed here).
    NEC 3FGx multisync monitor.
    Workbench 2.1, Kickstart 2.04.


INSTALLATION

    Warlords installed easily on my hard drive.  A program to perform
this installation is included, although no mention of it is made in the
technical supplement.  Warlords installs in any location you wish, and I had
no trouble saving and loading games from the hard drive.


REVIEW

    In the kingdom of Illuria, a long and shaky peace has come to an end
with the death of the archmage that enforced it.  You play the part of the
leader of one of eight empires within the kingdom.  Your goal is to
destroy your opponents utterly and unite the land under your rule.

    The leaders of the eight empires can be played by either the computer
or by humans.  There are four levels of computer control: knight, baron,
lord, and warlord.  Knight-level players are indecisive, often forgetting who
they were planning on attacking, etc.  Warlord-level players are at the
opposite end of the spectrum.  According to the manual, the most difficult
game would be one involving seven computer warlords against the human player.

    The game begins with each player's controlling a single city; the
other 72 cities are all neutral at this point.  After the mad rush is over to
capture as many neutral cities as possible, and the players begin eyeing each
others' cities, the real fun begins.  The sort of fun only found in
absolutely demolishing one's enemies.

    For this purpose, you have various types of armed forces.  Each city
produces at least one, usually several, types of units, varying from Navies
to Pegasi.  Additionally, along the course of the game you may acquire
heroes (all players start with one) and supernatural allies such as demons
and dragons.  Up to eight units can be "stacked" together for attacks (I liked
this, games like Empire (Interstel) that don't allow stacking absolutely
drive me crazy), and as many as 32 units can defend a city.  Units are
rated by strength and movement points.  Certain units are granted bonuses
that apply not only to themselves, but to any other units in the same stack.
These include a leadership bonus for heroes, and a flying army bonus for
winged armies.

    There are other facets to the game as well.  Simple economics play a 
significant role in the conquest of Illuria.  Each city produces a certain
amount of tax revenue, while each unit costs a certain amount to produce, and
half that amount to maintain.  A successful warlord with vast armies has to
keep an eye on his/her treasury.  Additionally, there are ruins that can be
explored by heroes; they often contain treasures or supernatural allies.
Libraries and temples also await exploration.

    Then there is the matter of what the other (computer) players want to
do to *you*.  The game rates, based on historical animosities and your
current actions, what each computer player thinks of you.  This can range
from apathy to outright loathing.  The computer player's actions are based
on this rating -- if someone loathes you, you can bet that player will be
coming after you with everything they've got!  And that brings up the matter
of the game's artificial intelligence (AI).  SSG is known for the quality of
its AI, and this game is no exception.  The computer players make
intelligent moves, sending concentrated forces to take target cities.  The
game will even intelligently move a unit to the destination you chose by the
quickest (least expensive in movement points) route.

    The game screen is divided into four sections.  The largest is a
tactical map covering the left side of the screen where the player issues
most of his/her orders.  Taking up the right side of the screen is the world
map, showing all of Illuria.  At various times, markers are displayed
indicating who owns which city, which ruins have been explored, which city
is producing what units, etc.  Between the two maps is a vertical strip of
icons that perform the most commonly used operations, such as switching
between production and movement. The bottom of the screen is used to display
text messages.

    The user interface is a delight to use.  It's simple to use, and
well thought out.  Moving the tactical view is accomplished with the cursor
keys, or by clicking on the world map.  Clicking on a unit selects it, and
double-clicking selects the entire stack.  Production is as simple as
entering production mode (via one of the icons in the central icon strip),
clicking on the unit to be built, and clicking on "produce".  The menu
options all have keyboard shortcuts.
    

DOCUMENTATION

    The documentation consists of a technical supplement and a relatively
short manual.  The supplement describes saving, loading, installing, and the
differences between the original Warlords and Warlords Enhanced.  The manual
amazed me.  I'm used to seeing fairly complex, detailed documentation for
strategy games (such as SSI's war games).  Instead, the manual for Warlords
is incredibly simple.  It took me maybe five minutes to read it from cover
to cover.  And it described everything I needed to know in those pages!
(Although I did have to come back to occasionally check the reference
section.)


LIKES AND DISLIKES

    LIKES

    I liked the playability.  I liked the variety of unit types, and the
strategy involved in manipulating them.  I liked the implementation of the
user interface.  I liked that the game was easy to install and play.
Basically, I liked everything about the game.

    DISLIKES

    I didn't really dislike anything about the game, but there are a few
things I wouldn't mind having added.  I'd like different world maps, rather
than having to play on the same one all the time.  I'd like these different
worlds to be unexplored (i.e., the player would be able to see only the part
of the world map that had already been explored).  I'd like a greater
variety of units, especially naval units (which currently act really only as
troop transports).  Different methods of attacking would be nice, as well,
since there are better strategies than frontal assault when dealing with
superior enemy forces.  The only other thing that I thought the game lacked
was a more spectacular ending when a human player was killed.  "So-and-So is
no longer a threat" just didn't seem like a very powerful death message.

    Most of these improvements were added in Warlords 2, which is
unfortunately not available for the Amiga.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    There really isn't another product quite like Warlords available for
the Amiga, but I will compare it to Sword of Aragon (SSI), and Civilization 
(Microprose).

    Sword of Aragon is similar to Warlords in that it's a strategy game
set in a fantasy world, with the player beginning with a single city and
having to conquer the rest of the "world".  The similarities stop there,
with Sword of Aragon following a story line, and Warlords (like most war
games) simply letting the player conquer and pillage as they see fit.  I
think players who enjoyed Sword of Aragon should like Warlords.

    Civilization fans may find Warlords to be a nice "quick and easy"
diversion, since Warlords is the same genre of game as Civilization, but not
as heavy in detail.

    
BUGS

    I did not observe any bugs.


CONCLUSIONS

    This is the way I like my games!  Warlords is fun, easy to learn,
easy to play, and requires a fair amount of thought.  It also has decent AI,
is multiplayer, runs on any model of Amiga, and is hard drive installable.

    If you like strategy games of any sort, you really *have* to get this
game.  Now if only I could get Warlords 2...

Hi..

Welcome to the new-look Amiga Newsbits. Hope you like the changes which have been made and can find your way around easily enough.

If this is your first fix of the magazine, then the same applies, and welcome to the club! We've been around weekly since March 93 since setting out to provide another special service for the Mostly Harmless BBS in the UK and providing a look at computing news, especially Amiga, from a European view.

Despite word that the Amiga is fading, users seem more active and interested than ever - look at the software, the results and the sales. Commodore is producing AGA machines to capacity, and despite financial troubles, they are selling computers people want to live with in their homes.

Thanks to everyone who has helped with getting this re-styled issue out. In no particular order.. Lee Sanders, Matthew Legg, Andy Gardener and Paul Wickham.

I couldn't have done it without them plus The Orb, The Fall, odd games of Super Mario 3 (traitor!), biscuits and, well, my Amiga 4000.

Have fun - and stay well.

@node FeatCD32 "A M i G A   N E W S B i T S  -  1.01  -  April 01, 1994"

    @{b}CD32 BITS@{ub}

Amiga CD32 went on the market in August last year and since then has sold more than 75,000 units as the first 32-bit console ever backed by high hopes.

As the machine perceived either to destroy Commodore or return them to former glory, it was the company's first entry into the console market since the days of the C16.

Although greeted with great enthusiasm by the press, existing Amiga users were more sceptical. After spending years trying to convey the Amiga as something more than a games machine, it was felt that Commodore had gone and produced something of exactly that nature. But as an A1200 in disguise, the CD32 can continue to offer the Amiga's leadership as a games and more serious home machine.

With the use of the Microbotics SX1 expansion card, the CD32 can be used to the same capabilities of an A1200 with the added bonus of a CD32 drive and full CD32 game compatibility.

In February 94, Gallup could report that CD32 software was the highest selling CD software format in Britain, above the Mega CD and PC CD-ROM. This is a trend set to continue with the imminent arrival of some eagerly awaited games like TFX and Rise Of The Robots.

CD expansions are soon expected for the A4000 and A1200, with recent previews in Germany at the @{"CeBit " link NewsAmiga} at last, soon opening up the world of disc for many more users.

Future editions will deal with the matter of the vapourware? "CD64", the FMV module, game and MPEG movie reviews.

There's plenty more which you Amiga owners are doing out there, so tell everyone about it. Anything on any Amiga-related topic is welcome - a scope as big as the Amiga's possibilities and your imagination.

We're also in other countries to provide details of Amiga happenings and
show reports.

Letters are also welcome and a mini classified sales is under consideration. Watch for details.

Let us know what you want - we can, quite probably, supply!
