@node Cnet.About "Cnet 3.05 Review"
Cnet Professional 3.05 BBS software

I saw the so called review of Cnet 3.05 in this months Amiga World and it made me 
laugh.  I am not sure if this guy has ever seen Cnet.  I used to run an older version of 
Cnet and I have not updated to the newest version although I have run the 3.05 demo to 
get an idea of what new features are incorporated.

First let me say that Cnet is an extremely powerful bbs package that is more versatile 
than either DLG Professional or AmiExpress.  However, what has failed to be 
mentioned about Cnet is the unique style of it.  It is by no stretch of the imagination an 
remote access clone.  The commands are all very different from standard bbs software.  
It does not come pre-configured with a menu other than that standard one line menu 
you have probably seen.  U for uploads, B for bases, G for gfiles, P for Pfiles, etc.  The 
problem with the software is first time users almost have to be an expert at computers in 
order to use it.  However, once the user has learned all the commands, Cnet is much 
faster than any other bbs package.  I have heard many sysops state that they go with 
Cnet because it is "different."  I have found that the "good" users will stick with it until 
they figure it out.  The users who cannot figure it out are the brain-dead IBMers who 
only understand the remote access commands: M for messages, R for read, etc.  If they 
ever bothered to take a look at the commands, they would not have any problem.  

Cnet has just about every feature imaginable in a bbs package.  It has qwk mail which is 
multi-tasking (you go about with your business and the bbs informs you when your qwk 
package is ready).  It has a built in mail-tosser, storage buffer for each user (for 
remembering selected files), multiple access levels, MCI codes to control text.  Cnet is 
so versatile that you can actually start a door from a message in the message bases.  
You can configure every aspect in any way that you want.  The configuration is easy to 
use.  The new manual is much better than the old 2.0 manual.  It supports Arexx and 
DOS doors as well as RAW window doors.  The only doors you really can't get to run 
with Cnet are those doors which look for an specific library in the bbs program such as 
most Xenolink doors do.

Overall, Cnet will take some time to setup due to its complexity even though the 
commands are fairly simple and you always have On-line help.  You will need to have 
snoopdos in your c directory at all times in order to track down any bugs that might 
occur on your system.  As for the speed of Cnet, it depends on your processor.  
Although it can be run on a 7mhz system, at least 16mhz is recommended.  Cnet works 
fine on a 4000/040 although the PD program HSCHK which is commonly used with 
Cnet to check the .dms files will not work with the '040 unless you disable it.  That really 
defeats the purpose of having the fast chip.  As for memory, Cnet does take up its fair 
share of memory.  It takes up about one meg and possibly more depending on how you 
have it configured.  You can configure things such as having the On-line spell checker 
in ram, etc.  It also depends on how many lines you are running.  It generally takes up 
about 256k for each port.  Most systems only have one line but will usually have a local 
node open so the sysop can be on-line while still allowing remote users to be On-line at 
the same time.  Some other programs that take up memory is AREXX since it must be 
run with Cnet.  Most systems also run doors with RexxPlus which is a compiled arexx 
program which will take up more memory.  Realistically, you need at least three Megs of 
ram to run the bbs on a single-line system to be safe.  Some of the arexx doors will take 
up more than 2 megs while running.

The problem with Cnet is its price.  It is just too much to pay for bbs software.  DLG, 
Excelsior, Skynet 2 are all around the same price and they are all overpriced.  If Cnet 
was priced between 100 - 125 dollars, I would recommend it as the bbs software to buy.  
However, once you buy it and it is updated, you will be required to pay an update fee in 
order to get the update.  The updates are free to a point.  For example, if you bought 
version 2.00, you would get free updates until it reached the 3.0 series and then you 
would have to pay another 75.00 for the update.  

Works on All Amigas with WB 2.0+.  HD Installable.

Rating: 7 out of 10

CONCLUSION:  Cnet is powerful, flexible bbs software which is very unique.  However, 
the price and the oddities makes Cnet not suited for every would-be sysop.

Answers to the most commonly asked questions on the Amigas.

1. CPU, Custom chips, RAM and other stuff
*****************************************

   This chapter contains questions concerning the Amiga-Hardware.

1.1. What are the 68EC020 and the 68EC030?
==========================================

   Motorola, the company producing the 680x0 family offers crippled
versions of their processors. They are a little bit cheaper than the
originals, that's why Commodore decided to build the 68EC020 into the
A1200 and the 68EC030 into the A4000/030.

   The difference between the 68020 and the 68EC020 is that the latter
can address just 16Mb of memory. That's why the A1200 cannot have more
that 10 Mb RAM. In most cases you will not notice the difference.

   This is not the case for the 68EC030: Many owners will notice that
the 68030 has a MMU and the 68EC030 doesn't have. There are some
important programs depending on a MMU, for example Enforcer (a
debugging utility), GigaMem (a program to emulate virtual memory) or
all current Unix versions (see Unix). Other Amigas than the A4000 and
the A3000 need an additional processor card to run these.

1.2. What's a FPU?
==================

   The first 680x0 processors (upto 68030) could process integers only.
Floating point operations had to be emulated by the software. A FPU is a
chip (or part of a chip) that can process floating point operations, a
mathematical coprocessor.

   One separates three FPU types on the Amiga: The 68881, 68882 and the
68040's internal FPU. The 68882 is up to 1.5 times faster than the
68881, because it is splitted in two parts: A conversion unit (the
FPU's are using an 80 bit format internally) and the arithmetic unit.
The 68040's internal FPU adds a pipeline, but misses the trigonometric
instructions of the others. These are still emulated by the software,
68040.library for example.

   Special programs (Raytracing, DTP, Mathematics, TeX) are offered in a
special coprocessor version which are up to 50 times faster than the
original versions.

   Michael Kaiser (kaiser@ira.uka.de)

2. The Operating System
***********************

   This chapter handles questions concerning the operating system,
Kickstart as well as the Workbench.

2.1. Can I use another Kickstart than the builtin?
==================================================

   First let's drop some words on the Kickstart's Copyright: This
belongs to Commodore, you *must* not use Kickstarts, without the right
to do it!  Especially it isn't allowed to make an image of anyone
else's Kickstart and run this on your own Amiga. (I even doubt that it
is allowed to do this on your own Amigas, if you have more than one.)

   But of course it is possible and allowed for some people, developers
for example.  There are two different ways, a hardware solution and a
software solution.  The former is to buy a card which can hold two or
more Kickstart ROMS and allows to select between when the System is
booting.

   The software solution needs a program (softkicker) and an image of
the ROM. The softkicker allocates RAM, loads the ROM image into the
allocated memory and reboots. Of course you have less RAM after the
Reboot: 256Kb when running Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3 and 512Kb for Kickstart
2.0 or higher.

   There are different Softkickers, some of them needing a MMU (see
68EC0xx). A nearly perfect solution seems to be `kick13' (Aminet,
directory `util/misc') because it has the ROM image included. (With
Commodores agreement!) For newer Kickstarts I recommend SKick 3.43
(Aminet, directory `os20/util') because it doesn't need a MMU and
supports many different Kickstarts. It is rather easy to create the ROM
image using the following program:

         #include <stdio.h>
     
         #define kickorig 0xf80000	/*  0xfc0000 for Kick 1.2 und 1.3   */
         #define kicklen  0x080000	/*  0x040000 for Kick 1.2 und 1.3   */
     
         void main(int argc, char*argv[])
           { FILE *fh;
     
     	if ((fh = fopen("kickstart.file", "w"))  !=  NULL)
     	  { result = fwrite(kickorig, kicklen, 1, fh);
     	  }
     	fclose(fh);
           }

3. Programming
**************

   This chapter handles problems arising for programmers only.

3.1. What documentation do I need as an Amiga programmer?
=========================================================

   The best information available are the RKMs (ROM Kernel Manuals), 3rd
edition, by Commodore, published by Addison-Wesley:
     *The Amiga ROM Kernel Manual:  Libraries
     The Amiga ROM Kernel Manual:  Devices
     The Amiga ROM Kernel Manual:  Includes and Autodocs
     The Amiga Hardware Reference Manual
     The Amiga User Interface Style Guide*

Especially the RKM: Libraries is a must. The RKM: Includes and Autodocs
isn't that much worth: Better get the same stuff on disk instead to
have it online.  See Includes.

   AmigaDOS isn't included in these books. The Autodocs give much
information, but to go deeper you probably need
     *The AmigaDOS Manual, 3rd Edition, by Commodore*
   published by Bantam Books.

   Another good choice is `The Amiga Guru Book' by Ralph Babel. The book
starts with a survey on different aspects of programming the Amiga.
(About 250 pages) Useful for beginners are the sections on the Amiga's
data types (not the 3.0-DataTypes), the Includes and the amiga.lib. But
even experienced programmers will find useful things here that are
missing in the RKMs.  But the largest part are about 500 pages on
AmigaDOS and, as I think, the most important, because AmigaDOS is the
worst officially documented part of the OS. The book is rather concise
and hence not as easy to read as the RKMs, but I recommend it as an
addition and instead of the AmigaDOS manual.  (Not, however, a
replacement for the Libraries and Devices, which aren't covered here.)
Unfortunately the book has no ISBN and is currently available in
Germany only. But there are some mail order companies which offer it for
about 50$ and which accept credit cards:

3.2. What is CATS?
==================

   This is a department at Commodore West Chester which was formerly
named `Commodore Amiga Technical Support' and was later renamed
`Commodore Application and Technical Support'. These are people that
work independently of Engineering, but close together with them, and try
to help developers outside of Commodore to create nice Amiga
applications, software or hardware. To achieve this, CATS has gathered
a lot of informations and tools, on floppy, CD, or paper. Much of this
material is also available to the general public. (1) But don't mix
this up with some sort of Hotline for everyone!

   For Americans the address to get this material is

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  Which means: For Non-Developers.

3.3. Where do I get the Amiga includes?
=======================================

   The only legal way to get the includes and autodocs (and you *should*
get them, they are *very* useful!) is to become a developer (see
Developer) or to buy the NDUK (Native developers update kit), which is
offered by CATS. They cost about 25$ and this seems to me to be a fair
price. See CATS. The current version is 3.1.

   If you need only the includes, you could get them as well with a
compiler (commercial compilers or the registered version of Dice) or by
getting the Fresh Fish CD. See Fish CD.

3.4. How do I become a developer?
=================================

   You need the ADSP (Amiga Developer Support Program) documents. To
get this write a letter to your local Commodore branch asking for these
documents.  Everything else should be explained there. The german
address is
         Commodore
         Lyoner Strasse 38
         60528 Frankfurt
   There are three different developer versions:
*Registered*
     developers seem to me to have no special advantages except getting
     a magazine called AmigaMail. Especially they don't receive the new
     Includes & AutoDocs and beta releases of Kickstart and Workbench.
     Being a registered developer costs about 70$ per year.

*Certified*
     developers don't have these disadvantages. They have to sign the
     so called NDA (Non Disclosure Agreement) and so aren't allowed to
     tell other people what they know. Certified developers pay about
     280$ per year.

*Commercial*
     developers pay about 550$ per year.

A tip is to build a group of users and become a developer group, so the
costs are reduced.

3.5. What compilers (assemblers) are there?
===========================================

   There is a lot of programming languages on the Amiga, commercial as
well as freely distributable. I will enumerate only those that I know
or which seem it worth to me otherwise.

*Assembler*
     All C-compilers have an Assembler included. Freely distributable
     are A68K and PhxAss (directory `dev/asm' on Aminet or Fish disks
     521 and 906)

*C*
*C++*
     Freely distributable C-compilers are `gcc' (which has its own
     directory `dev/gcc' on Aminet) and the evaluation version of
     `Dice' (for example per FTP from `ftp.uni-paderborn.de', directory
     `/news/comp.binaries.amiga/volume91/languages' or on Fish disk
     491).  `Dice' is Shareware, however, but registering will cost
     only 50$.  The advantage of `gcc' is that you find `gcc' versions
     all over the world and on all computer systems. Another advantage
     is that C++ is included into `gcc'! But it is slow and needs 4Mb
     of RAM or more. `Dice' is very fast. Both compilers seem to be
     reliable.

     Commercial C compilers are `Aztec-C' and `SAS-C'. I cannot
     recommend `Aztec-C', because the compiler doesn't seem to get
     further development. It should be remarked that the commercial
     compilers have especially wonderful debugging utilities (Source
     level debuggers!) that the others are missing. `Dice' will become
     commercial soon too and probably will have debugging utilities
     then. SAS has announced a new release which will have C++ included.

     Comeau C++ is a cross compiler creating C source. That wouldn't be
     a problem, SAS will do the same. But Comeau C++ doesn't have a C
     compiler included.  You need SAS-C, Aztec-C or Dice additionally.
     But it supports the newest standards. And like gcc it runs on many
     platforms. Maxxon C++ is offered in Germany. I cannot say anything
     on it. Both compilers are commercial.  Comeaus address is:
              Comeau computing
              91-34, 120th Street

              USA
          
              EMail: Greg Comeau, comeau@bix.com

*Forth*
     JForth is said to be an excellent Amiga port of Forth. Among its
     advantages are object oriented extensions, full Amiga interface
     and an application generator. It is available from:
              Delta Research
              P.O. Box 151051

              EMail: Phil Burk, phil@ntg.com
          	   Mike Haas, haas@starnine.com

*Fortran*
     (Sigh! Still people who need it :-<) Freely distributable are BCF
     (Fish disk 470) and f2c, a Fortran to C converter (Aminet,
     directory `/dev/misc'). A commercial compiler is offered from
     ABSoft. All these are Fortran 77 compilers, I don't know any
     Fortran 90 compiler on the Amiga.

*Lisp*
     Freely distributable Lisp interpreters are XLisp (Fish disk 181)
     and OakLisp (Fish disk 530).

*Prolog*
     `/dev/lang/UNSWProlog.lha' and `dev/lang/sbp3_1e.lha' on Aminet as
     well as `SBProlog' on Fish disk 141 and `SBProlog' on Fish disk
     145 are freely distributable Prolog interpreters.

*Modula-2*
     M2Amiga is offered in Europe, Benchmark Modula-2 in the U.S. Both
     are said to be very good, have a powerful souurce-level-debugger,
     a large library.  Especially M2Amiga has great support by a german
     user-group (AMOK) which for example offers own PD disks.

     M2Amiga is offered by:

*Oberon*
*Oberon-2*
     AmigaOberon is offered by A+L too. It is integrated into a full
     developers environment and has a large library of modules. Library
     linker and source level debugger are available. The AMOK user goup
     supports AmiOberon as well as M2Amiga.

*Pascal*
     There is a PD-compiler called PCQ (Directory `dev/lang' on Aminet
     or Fish disk 511). It doesn't support all of Pascal and major
     features are missing. P2C, a pascal to C converter is on disk 341.
     (Aminet: `/dev/misc/p2c120.lha') Additionally there are two
     commercial compilers called HiSoft Pascal and KickPascal. HiSoft
     Pascal and P2C claim to be compatible to Turbo Pascal up to 5.0.
     HiSoft has a source level debugger included.

3.6. Those never working Esc sequences!
=======================================

   Many printers come with a manual that explains which Esc sequence
causes which action on the printer. But there happen weird things when
you try to send these sequences to your printer, either it does
nothing, or it does something completely different. There is a reason,
the Amiga printer drivers. These drivers are made in a way that they
only understand a certain set of `ANSI Esc sequences', not the special
ones defined (differently) by the various printer manufacturers. The
purpose is that every application on the Amiga just uses this one
standard set of control sequences and this way doesn't need to know
which printer is actually connected. The printer driver then translates
these standard sequences into the special sequences a certain printer
understands.  A list of the available ANSI Esc sequences is found in
the current Workbench manuals (or older AmigaDOS manuals). Now if you
want to issue a control sequence to the printer that's not available as
an ANSI command, you have two possibilities to achieve this:
  1. Bypass the printer driver (that would unsuccessfully try to
     interpret the sequence) and send your output *only* during this
     sequence to `PAR:' (or `SER:', respectively). For this you have to
     close and open printer output channels very often which is rather
     tedious, and you have to know where (`PAR:' or `SER:') your
     printer is connected.

  2. Use a special ANSI sequence, made exactly for this case:
              `Esc[<n>"<x>'
     where `<n>' is the decimally typed number of bytes in the string
     `<x>', which actually contains your special printer sequence. This
     ANSI sequence tells the printer driver to not interpret or
     translate the next `<n>' bytes.
        But both methods have one big disadvantage when used in an
application program: You lose the printer independency! If you stick to
ANSI sequen- ces, you can output to any printer on earth, as long as
there is an Amiga printer driver for it. If you start to use special
control sequences, your program will be tied to this single printer
model and will not be usefull for any other (or you would have to
provide some dozen new printer drivers for your application).

3.7. Is it possible to use AmigaBasic on the A1200?
===================================================

   We heard conflicting reports about AmigaBasic on the A1200: While I
said that you can work sufficiently with it, others said that this
isn't possible, as AmigaBasic crashes on the slightest little error.  I
couldn't reproduce this.

   Now I can. It depends on the setting in the Sound Prefs editor. When
you activate a sound there, this conflicts with sound that AmigaBasic
tries to produce by hand and obviously not quite the correct way itself.

   Easy solution: To work with AmigaBasic on the A1200, just
  1. Switch off sound output in the Sound prefs editor.

  2. On the A4000 (as well as on an A1200 with Fast Mem expansion (1))
     you  additionally need to run NoFastMem.

  3. Better avoid SUBs and use conventional GOSUBs instead, then the
     compatibility with newer processors will be higher.

3.8. How do I localize my program?
==================================

   Suggest, you want to write a `HelloLocalWorld.c'. Your final program
will look like this:

         #include "HelloLocalWorld_Cat.h"
         #include <exec/clib_protos.h>
     
         struct Library *LocaleBase;
     
         void main(int argc, char *argv[])
     
         {
             /* Open the locale.library. No kill, if not successfull. (Just
     	   use the builtin catalog strings instead.) Note, that we open
                locale.library here, even if our compiler supports AutoOpening.
     	*/
     	LocaleBase = OpenLibrary("locale.library", 38);
     	OpenHelloLocalWorldCatalogs(NULL, NULL);
     
     	printf(GetString(MSG_Hello));
     
     	CloseHelloLocalWorldCatalog();
     	if (LocaleBase) CloseLibrary(LocaleBase);
         }

   The routine GetString checks, if the wished catalogs are available
and returns a pointer to either the builtin string or the catalog
string. (In my case the german string.)

   You see, the main difference besides the minor opening and closing
stuff (OpenLibrary, OpenHelloLocalWorldCatalogs, ...) is to replace
strings with a function call. Hence we need a file
`HelloLocalWorld_Cat.c', which holds OpenHelloLocalWorld, GetString,
CloseHelloLocalWorld and the builtin strings (this could be an array,
where
     	array[MSG_Hello] = "Hello, local world.\n";

is defined) and an include file `HelloLocalWorld_Cat.h', which defines
the message ID's like MSG_Hello. You don't need to know, how these files
work internally, especially you don't need to know `locale.library'!

   There are some catalog generators (in what follows: CGs) available
(`CatComp', for devlopers only, `KitCat', german docs only, `MakeCat',
which I don't know and `FlexCat', which I  recommend, because it is
most flexible in the generated source and supports catalogs on 2.0 and
any language, even Amiga-E, Cluster, Pascal, ... and besides that: I'm
the author ;-) are tools, that create  HelloLocalWorld_Cat.h,
HelloLocalWorld_Cat.c and the real catalogs for you. (The above code
might differ slightly between the different CGs.) (See Aminet, directory
`dev/misc'.)

   Of course they need to know how to use them. First create a so-called
`catalog-description' file. This could look like this:
         ; Lines beginning with a semicolon are comment lines.
         # language english
         ; the language of the builtin strings
         # version 0
         ; the catalog version (0 = any)
         MSG_Hello (1/15/30)
         Hello, local world

Any string is defined by a line like the last two lines above: MSG_Hello
is the message-ID, (1/15/30) says, that the value of MSG_Hello should be
1 (you may omit this, in which case just the next free number is used)
and the string must not be shorter than 15 characters or longer than 30
characters. (These may be omitted too.)

   Now write your program. Once you are ready, use the CGs to create a
so-called catalog translation file. (One for any language different than
the builtin.) In my case (german) this could look like this:
         ; Lines beginning with a semicolon are comment lines.
         ## language deutsch
         ; the catalog language (german)
         ## version $VER: Deutsch.catalog 1.0 (22.12.93)
         ; the catalog files version string
         MSG_Hello
     
         ; Hello, local world

Note the empty line after the message ID. (The arguments of ## language
and ## version would be missing as well.) You have to fill in the
german strings here. Again using the CGs you create a catalog file from
this. Additionally note, that no informations on the strings ID or
length are behind MSG_Hello.  They are taken from the catalog
description file.

   Once you change the program (adding strings, changing the string
length) you change the catalog description as well, use the CGs in the
same way to update the catalog translation and hence the catalogs.

3.9. How do I get the window pointer of my console?
===================================================

   Here is an example from the csh-Source. (No garanty, as I didn't
write it! ;-)
         struct Process *Myprocess = (struct Process *)FindTask(NULL);
         struct Window *win = NULL;
         if (Myprocess->pr_ConsoleTask)
           { struct InfoData *infodata;
            if (infodata=AllocMem(sizeof(struct InfoData),
                                  MEMF_CLEAR|MEMF_PUBLIC))
             { if (DoPkt((void *)Myprocess->pr_ConsoleTask,
                         ACTION_DISK_INFO,((LONG)infodata)>>2,
                         NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL))
               { win=(struct Window *)infodata->id_VolumeNode;
               }
               FreeMem(infodata,sizeof(struct InfoData));
             }
           }

If all goes right, `win' will be the pointer to the window, NULL
otherwise

   Note the following problem: You cannot close the window, if it is an
`Auto'-window!

4. Applications
***************

   This chapter offers informations about major Applications.

4.1. Text Editors
=================

   Text Editors are programs allowing to enter and edit unformatted
text.  Generally, this means text that is meant to be manipulated by
machine, rather than human. Programmers use these to enter the text for
compilers.  Since UNIX machines don't typically have word processors,
most text processing starts with a text editor, then is filtered
through a page layout system (TeX, for example) to produce attractive
paper results.

*Commercial Products*
     CygnusEd Professional and TurboText seem to be the main contenders
     in the professional realm. The Fred Fish disks contain dozens of
     other shareware text editors. A demo version of TurboText is on
     Fish disk 445.  A very old demo of CygnusEd is on Fish disk 95
     (testament to its lasting-power). In the following some freely
     distributable editors will be discussed.

*Emacs*
     Gnu Emacs (the "G" is not silent) comes from Unix and is probably
     the king of editors - it's huge (about 1 Megabyte), feature-packed
     (it does windows and even contains a game!) and extensible (if you
     know lisp you can write new emacs functions and bind them to any
     key combination).	On the other hand, it may be too huge, its
     feature-ladenness is imposing, and its extensibility often means
     you can't use someone else's emacs configuration. Source: Aminet
     (directory `util/gnu').

*Vi*
     The leaner, less configurable, non-extensible cousin to gnu emacs
     is vi (pronounced "vee eye"). Unix people like vi especially
     because you find it on *any* Unix machine. What you choose is
     personal preference, and will mark you for life. Vim is a good vi
     for the amiga, and is on Fish disk 591 or in the `util/gnu'
     directory of Aminet.

*DME*
     Many Amiga programmers like DME. It's fast, fully configurable;
     menus may be created and any key may be mapped. It's much easier
     to learn DME than than Emacs or Vi. There are three different
     versions: AmokEd, DME and XDME. It's a matter of opinion which you
     prefer. (Oberon and Modula programmers like AmokEd because it's
     written in Oberon and supports AmiOberon error messages, C
     programmers like DME or XDME.) Sources: Aminet (directory
     `util/edit'), Fish disk 776 (XDME) and 749 (AmokEd), AMOK 90.

4.2. What word processors are there?
====================================

   A word processor is the typical application for writing notes,
letters or reports on a computer. Unless you prepare newsletters on a
weekly basis, your word procesor is probably your workhorse program.
Thus choosing one you are comfortable with determines how comfortable
you are with your computer. Word processors can offer a variety of
features, and many can approach the sophistication required for Desktop
Publishing (see DTP) but no one uses them for programming, for which
text editors are more suited.

   One distinguishes between Wysiwyg programs (What you see is what you
get) and page layout languages. Wysiwyg programs should be fast,
comfortable and easy to use. Most people prefer them. The alternative
is an approach that works similar to compilers. You feed text files to
a a program that produces the layout which may be previewed on screen
or printed. LaTeX takes this approach. See TeX. Lout is another such
system which seems smaller, easier to learn and has full documentation
included, but it is nonstandard.  Lout produces Postscript output. (I
don't know if this is an advantage or disadvantage. ;-) See Postscript.
Both programs are freely distributable.

   There are a lot of wysiwyg programs, but only commercial products:
Final Copy II, Wordworth, Word Perfect, AmiWrite, Beckertext II, Maxon
Word and many others. I don't dare to recommend any. ALl I can say is:
Give yourself time to make a selection.

4.3. Desktop Publishing
=======================

   These programs offer features lacking in word processors, usually
tailored to flexible arrangement of text, but often don't provide all of
the text manipulation that a good word processor provides. The best
desktop publishing programs strive to provide the features of both,
just as the best word processors strive to provide the features of
desktop publishing programs. Microsoft Word (Mac, PC) is a good example
of a word processing program that offers many page layout feature.
Framemaker (UNIX, Macintosh, DOS, etc.) is an example of a desktop
publishing system that offers most needed word processing functions. As
yet, no Amiga program has bridged the gap, though the main word
processors are coming close. (On the other hand, even many
sophisticated programs don't support typesetting mathematics, tables,
producing bibliographies, indexes, or cross-references. The page layout
languages do, and programs like Frame are improving their support of
such features.) Unless you need to prepare fancy newsletters or
promotional literature, a word processing program is probably enough.
See Word Processors.

   There are not yet any freely distributable wysiwyg desktop publishing
systems. Commercial products are ProPage and PageStream. They have been
playing leapfrog for the past few years. It appears that PageStream 3.0
is about to leap ahead. A more detailed description of these products
and their differences is welcome. Both programs' list prices are $299.
Student discounts are available (approx 40% discount.)

4.4. What is TeX and where can I get it?
========================================

   TeX is a very powerful wordprocessing system. It can display
mathematical formulas or complex tables as well as function graphs,
creates indices, contents and many other things. Its greatest advantage
is that it is freely distributable (TeX, not the previewers and the
printer drivers!) and that you find TeX all over the world on every
computer family. Its greatest disadvantage is that it isn't very handy
(works similar to a compiler) and it isn't wysiwyg. But many people
like it. (BTW: This document is written using TeX. 8-) See Word
Processors.

   There are two major implementations on the Amiga. The first one,
Amiga-TeX, from Thomas Rockicki and Radical Eye software is commercial.
It is said to be excellent and his owners seem to be very satisfied.
But it costs at least 200$.

   I recommend PasTeX, a freely distributable version. People seem to
have problems installing PasTeX, especially the font loading and
generation (It's a quite complex program.) but I did not here anyone
upset once it was installed. (A friend with knowledge of TeX helps
immensely.) A few words should be said what you need:
   * 5 disks containing the TeX-compiler itself

   * 2 disks containing MetaFont

   * Nothing more Many people ask for fonts. They are included in the
MetaFont-package and can get compiled by you. All you need to do is
setting up your TeX-system in the right way which is described in the
documentation. Please note that the PasTeX disks are compressed using
the program Zoom. (see Endings) Sources: FTP at `ftp.uni-passau.de',
directory `/pub/amiga/tex/PasTeX1.3'.

4.5. Are there any Postscript interpreters?
===========================================

   PostScript is a programming language designed to be used to describe
printing on pages. Apple helped make PostScript popular by selling
printers with built in PostScript interpreters. Many programs have
evolved to produce PostScript programs as their output, making
PostScript the lingua franca of printing. Until recently, in order to
print a PostScript file, you had to have a relatively expensive laser
printer. The development that changed this was the software PostScript
interpreter. These programs allow your computer to interpret PostScript
programs, and produce the matrix of dots to send to your normal
graphics printer.

   One of the benefits of PostScript is that it is resolution
independent.  What this means is that it can support the highest
resolution of your device - and that you can reasonably preview
PostScript on a low resolution screen.

   There are two free PostScript interpreters for the Amiga. Post and
Ghostscript. Post comes as an Amiga shared library along with front
ends for previewing to the screen and printing. This structure allows
others to write programs that can show PostScript images on screen. In
fact, AmigaTeX uses Post's library to support incorporation of
PostScript into documents.  Ghostscript similarly comes in two
programs, but not as a shared library.  Ghostscript is the rendering
engine, and Ghostview is the front end.  Sources: Aminet (directorys
`text/print' and `text/dtp'), Fish disk 669

5. How about Graphics?
**********************

   Graphics is one of the major strengths of the Amiga. Why don't we
have more answers here? :-(

5.1. What are chunky and planar displays?
=========================================

   Simply put, the terms `chunky' and `planar' (short for `bitplanar')
refer to different ways of storing graphics information in a computer's
memory. They are rather easy to understand, as far as things go, but
incredibly difficult to explain:

   Computer images are arranged as a grid of pixels, each of which can
be thought of as a number representing the color number of the pixel,
sort of like a paint-by-numbers scheme.  For example, here's a
simplified example image, in four colors:

        00302132

   The Amiga stores this image in a `bitplane' mode. That is, it is
represented by several planes of bits (binary digits, 1s or 0s). This
is a four-color image, so each color number could be represented by two
bits.  Therefore there are two bitplanes:

        00100110    Here's bitplane 0
        00101011    And here's bitplane 1
        --------    Now, let's add them up, binary style:
        00302132

   Which is the final image. If the image was in two dimensions, it
would truly be composed of bit planes. However, I'd need three
dimensions to show multiple bitplanes overlayed, and therefore for
simplicity we're working in one dimension (which is all we need).

   Now, there's another way of storing this image.  How about if we
localize the bit data in little chunks?

        00 00 11 00 01 10 11 01 = 00302132

   This is the principle of the `chunky' pixel mode.

   Both methods of image storage are perfectly logical, and no one can
say that one is better than the other. However, there are certain
technical aspects which cause certain advantages and disadvantages.

   First, if you've seen colored text scroll on your Amiga, you know
there is a bit of "flicker" that arises. Specifically, what happens is
that while the text is scrolling, its color temporarily changes to
something completely different. What's happening is that the computer's
moving several bitplanes of data while the raster (monitor electron
gun) is sweeping across the screen. What that means is that, if the
raster catches the data while it's being moved, you can end up with some
bitplanes being moved and some not. What if we filled bitplane 1 in the
example above with 0s? Instantly all the 3s become 1s, and the 2s
become 0s! This is what causes "flicker" when certain colors are
scrolled. By contrast, if a chunky pixel display is caught while
scrolling, all we see is a partially-scrolled image; the colors are
preserved (since their units are the small ones).

   That's a disadvantage to planar pixels, but what about chunky pixels?
Well, recall that a computer organizes information in terms of 8 bit
bytes. These groups are static; you cannot decide to all of a sudden
organize data in terms of three bytes or something! Therefore, when
using chunky pixels, things get complicated if we decide to use a
nonconvenient number of bits per pixel. In practice, the 8-bit
(256-color) mode, and 24-bit (16 million color) modes are the most
common candidates for chunky pixel displays.

   Finally, certain effects can be accomplished with the different
systems.  Bitplanar mode is particularly useful for things like shadows
(where an extra bitplane is set with 1s instead of 0s), and chunky mode
is great for perspective and "mapping" (since the data for each pixel is
localized in a single "chunk"). The latter advantage makes chunky pixel
mode really great for games, and is what made Wolfenstein 3-D possible.

   We all know that Amigas use the bitplane system for storing images.
However, the Macintosh and PC(VGA) both use chunky pixel modes. While
we can optimize our RAM usage with "bizarre" modes like 8- and
128-color, they gain the advantages of non-flicker scrolling, and the
programming simplicity of just writing a byte where you want the pixel
to go.

   The difference between the two modes becomes problematic in things
like emulation. EMPLANT has a "chunky to planar" routine which it uses
to convert a Macintosh display into an Amiga one. "Chunky to planar"
routines are also useful for getting chunky-inclined things to run on
Amigas (see TMAPDemo, rotdemo). On a side note, there was some
confusion as to what EMPLANT used the MMU for with regard to chunky to
planar. The MMU itself is incapable of performing the algorithm for the
conversion; rather, it is used to detect what portions of the display
memory are updated from the Mac side, and therefore the processor is
saved from having to perform the chunky to planar conversion for the
entire display.

   I sincerely hope that helped clear up most of the mystery concerning
the terms "Chunky" and "Planar"!

5.2. What is doublebuffering?
=============================

   Don't be ashamed if you haven't a clue as to what this is. It's
rather simple, really. Imagine you wanted to animate something by
drawing out each frame. Now imagine you had only one piece of paper.
Even if you drew pretty fast, it would be difficult to see what the
animation looks like because you'd have to erase the frame you just
drew, in order to draw the next one!

   What if you had two pieces of paper? Why, then, you could see the
difference between two adjacent frames. First you'd draw your first
frame on the first piece of paper, then you'd draw the second frame on
the other piece.  Then you'd erase the picture on the first piece of
paper, and draw in the third frame. Then you'd erase the picture on the
second piece of paper, and draw in the fourth frame, and so forth.

   This is the principle of doublebuffering. The computer shows you the
picture it just drew, then turns around and draws the next one. It then
swaps the picture in front of you with the one it just drew, and
repeats the process. The result is a smooth animation, because you
never need to see the computer draw; all you see is each finished
product.

   (Joseph Luk, jluc@eis.calstate.edu)

5.3. What monitors will work on my Amiga 1200/4000?
===================================================

   Monitors can be classified after the horizontal scan frequency they
require.  TVs, as well as C='s 1084 monitor, need frequencies around 15
kHz. VGA/SVGA need approx. 30 kHz. Multisync monitors can take many
frequencies.

   In short: You can use any monitor you want with an A1200. BUT:

   - If you use a regular VGA/SVGA monitor, you can only use a few
     display modes (like DblPAL, DblNTSC and/or Productivity). I.e.
     (320|640) x (256|512|1024) for DblPAL. This is great for Workbench
     and all "serious" utilities (DTP etc), but don't expect any games
     to work... they don't use your preferences, just take over the
     machine and assume a 15 kHz monitor. Also, you cannot utilize the
     "Early Startup Control" screen (you know, disable cache, and that
     stuff), which also requires a 15 kHz monitor. Furthermore, VGA
     monitors don't have speakers. And the VGA-type modes don't support
     Genlocks. But for a lot of "serious" work, a VGA monitor is quite
     adequate.

   - You already know what happens with a 15 kHz monitor; the
     flickering in Interlace mode. A small tip: Try to use NTSC instead
     of PAL. This increases the refresh rate from 25 Hz to 30 Hz, at
     the expense of lower vertical resolution (482 lines maximum). The
     NTSC and PAL modes aren't as bad as many people think. If your
     monitor has a lot of phosphorous (long afterglow), PAL Laced can
     be quite OK, and it gives you a resolution of 1448x566 in
     SuperHiRes. That's the highest resolution currently supported on
     AGA Amigas, in _any_ display mode.

   - A Multisync gives you the best of both worlds. The new 1940 and
     1942 monitors from C= are quite OK, although rather cumbersome to
     use... The h/v size and offset must be set manually each time you
     switch display mode.  (1)

   For a VGA/SVGA or Multisync monitor, you'd need a little shiny box
which gives you the standard 15-pin "D" connector. It costs around $15.

   There are other alternatives... like the "AmiVGA" box ($50 or so),
which I think is a cheapo version of the Flicker Fixer. (But it's
really a shame to use this on an AGA Amiga.)

   Also, you can get a VGA monitor, and hook up your TV to the
composite or RF port on the Amiga - one monitor for games, one for
serious stuff.

   (1)  A patch is available on Aminet for Kickstart 3.0 to do this
without manual actions in the file `os30/util/Monitor30Patch.lha'.

5.4. How do I switch between PAL and NTSC?
==========================================

   PAL and NTSC are two different video standards, the former being
European, and the latter being American. PAL has a slightly taller
screen (256 lines non-interlaced, non-overscanned) as opposed to NTSC
(200 lines), so if you see the bottom portion of a program's screen
getting cut off on your American machine, chances are the program was
written for PAL, and is running on your shorter NTSC screen. PAL and
NTSC differences are somewhat less important to European users; since
their machines default to PAL, running an NTSC program is no more than
a minor annoyance having the screen only appear in the top portion of
the display.

   Therefore, for us NTSC folks, switching into PAL mode becomes
important to avoid loss of some picture on Euro Demos, etc.

   First, the most common misconception about switching between PAL and
NTSC is that you need a Multiscan or special monitor for such a purpose.
Not so! Just about any monitor can handle the minor signal difference
between PAL and NTSC (50Hz vertical refresh versus 60Hz). The 108x,
19xx, and 20xx series, and even most TVs, can display both PAL and NTSC.
Sometimes it is necessary to perform minor tweaking of vertical hold
and/or v. size on your monitor to achieve full display, though this is
trivial.

   What IS needed to switch between PAL and NTSC in software, is a
"Fatter" (1MB) Agnus or better. If your system has more than 512K of
CHIP RAM (use the avail command to find out) you have this chip. If you
do not, ou can still construct a hardware switch (see below).

   The following directions assume you're an NTSC user who wants to
switch into PAL mode, but the procedure for going from PAL to NTSC is
much the same.

   The most common use of switching into PAL is for self-booting games,
demos, etc.  The best way to accomplish this on pre-3.0 systems is to
use Chris Hames' Degrader program (most recent version: 1.30). Once you
have procured this program, the switch is as simple as selecting
"50Hz", and "50Hz System", then installing the program's ROMTag (little
program that runs at boot-time) by pressing the "Survive Reset(s)"
button.

   AmigaDOS 3.0 added a PAL/NTSC switch feature to its Boot Menu, and
all you need to do in order to access this is hold down both mouse
buttons as the computer boots. Select Display Options, Display
Mode/PAL, and then Boot. If the program still fails to go into PAL mode
(Zool is one I've found), you may wish to get Degrader anyway and try
that.

   Software PAL/NTSC switching is easy and painless. Some people have
gone even further by installing hardware PAL/NTSC switches. This
results in a system which even the most nasty hardware-banging programs
can't bring to its original configuration (if it has been switched).
The procedure is simple - most Amigas have jumpers already - but beyond
the scope of this document.

   Therefore, if your screen is too short or cut off, seek the different
screen mode. You'll "see new horizons", literally!

6. Emulators
************

   What? The Amiga isn't good enough? You really want it to be another
machine?  Well, look here...

6.1. Can I run Unix on my Amiga?
================================

   Actually there are three Unix versions on the Amiga. All of them
need at least 68030 (see 68EC0xx), probably a 68040 in the near future
and seem to have problems with many hard-drive-controllers. You should
have a good look into the documentation before installing it. Unix
needs much resources, say at least 10Mb RAM and a 150Mb Unix-partition
on the hard-drive.

  1. Commodore offered a System V Unix in the past. It contained TCP/IP,
     X11 and other software and seemed to make a good job, but it was
     expensive and after all Commodore has dropped developing it.
     Commodore-Unix needs a streamer because it is distributed on tapes.

  2. A Linux port is prepared. But actually there is not very much than
     the kernel. Specialists might like to use it, but it cannot be
     recommended for now. Linux is freely distributable. Sources:
     `ftp.uni-paderborn.de', directory `/pub/amiga/linux' or
     `ftp.uni-erlangen.de', directory `/pub/LINUX/MIRROR.tsx-11/680x0'.

  3. NetBSD is freely distributable too. Like Linux it isn't ready for
     now, but it seems to make big steps. Most GNU software is said to
     run, especially emacs and gcc. I think it's worth to have a look
     on it. Sources: `ftp.uni-paderborn.de', directory
     `/pub/amiga/NetBSD' or `ftp.uni-erlangen.de', Directory
     `/pub/amiga/unix/NetBSD'.

6.2. Is it possible to use the Amiga as X11 terminal?
=====================================================

   Yes, it is. There are two different packages available:

   GfxBase offers a commercial version which is said to be excellent,
but expensive. The distribution includes different window managers
andclients.  A demo version is on Aminet.
(`gfx/x11/GfxBase-X11-Demo.lha')

   DaggeX is freely distributable and probably not finished yet. (It
calls itself version 0.22.) Source: Aminet,
`gfx/misc/localDaggeX0_22.lha' and `gfx/x11/twm_930531.lha'.

7. Miscellaneous
****************

   This last chapter contains some questions that don't fit in the
chapters above.

7.1. Is there any unix version of LhA?
======================================

   See Endings.

7.2. What are files ending with ...?
====================================

   Most endings on FTP sites or Fish disks tell you that the file is
compressed and/or is an archive containing more than one file. Some
programs even archive whole disks. Frequently found endings and
programs to handle the related files are:
*.sfx*
     Compressed archives which are included in an executable program:
     Just call the program and it will extract itself (sfx = self
     extract)

*.lha*
*.lzh*
     Compressed archives; recommended: LhA (`util/arc/LhA_e138.run' on
     Aminet  or Fish disk 715) or Lx (`util/arc/lx100.lha' on Aminet),
     Unix version available (`misc/unix/lha-1.00.tar.Z')

*.dms*
     Disks compressed using DMS (`util/arc/dms111.sfx' on Aminet or
     Fish disk 406)

*.zom*
     Disks compressed using Zoom (`util/arc/Zoom_5.4.lha' on Aminet,
     Fish disk 682); an older version which you probably need for
     uncompressing PasTeX is found on Fish disk 459.

*.zoo*
     Compressed archive; recommended: Zoo (`util/arc/zpp2-10.lzh' on
     Aminet or Fish disk 527)

*.Z*
*.z*
*.gz*
     Compressed files; recommended gzip (`util/arc/gzip-1.2.3bin.lha' on
     Aminet), note that this are Unix files in most cases

*.tar*
     Acrhive; recommended: tar (`util/arc/tar.lha' or
     `util/arc/gtar10.lha' on Aminet or Fish disk 445), note that tar is
     a Unix archiver and you often find soething like `.tar.Z'.

*.arj*
     Compressed archive; recommended unarj (`util/arc/unarj-0.5.lha' on
     Aminet)

*.zip*
     Compressed archive; recommended UnZip (`util/arc/unzip-5.1.lha' on
     Aminet), note that this are MS-Dos archives in most cases

7.3. Is there a Stacker-like utility to pack my hard drive?
===========================================================

   XFH does a good job. It operates as a handler and uses the
XPK-libraries, so you have different compression modes (NUKE is a good
choice) and possibly even more in the future. The only disadvantage is,
that the size of a file is limited by RAM: Don't use it with less than
2MB of RAM. Sources: Aminet (`util/pack/XFH134.lha' and
`util/pack/xpk25usr.lha'), Fish disk 754.

   Another possibility is EPU. It's shareware and should offer the same
as XFH, but without limiting the file size. Sources: Aminet
(`util/pack/epu14.lha'), Fish disk 858.

7.4. Where do I get Fish disk xxx?
==================================

   Those FTP servers have that much space (or a CD-Rom) to have all
fish disks available online:
     ftp.isca.uiowa.edu      (USA, directory `/amiga/fx/fxxx')
     ftp.hawaii.edu          (USA, directory `/pub/amiga/fish')
     ftp.dfv.rwth-aachen.de  (Germany, directory `/pub/amiga/fish')
     ftp.uni-erlangen.de     (Germany, directory `/pub/amiga/pd')
     ftp.funet.fi            (Finland, directory `/pub/amiga/fish')

Note that the CD-Rom's are not always mounted. See FTP.

   Another possibility would be to ask your local dealer. :-)

8. Where and how do I get Software?
***********************************

   Three questions arise in this context: Which programs can be found,
where are they and how to get them and transfer them home?

8.1. Files and databases on freely distributable software
=========================================================

   Of course you need to know where you find things. Many good choices
are listed in this paper, as I hope. Other sources are:

*AmigaSciSchool*
     is a list of software and where you find it in Ascii format. It is
     posted monthly to the newsgroups `comp.sys.amiga.applications',
     `comp.unix.amiga', and `news.answers'. Additionally you will find
     it on Aminet sites (`text/doc/AmigaSciSchool-4.01'). It handles
     everything listed here and many more, for example GNU software,
     libraries (linked and shared), shells, Unix commands, educational
     and scientific software and much more.

*FishCon*
     are lists of the Fish disk contents. (`fish/doc/fishcon-???.lzh' on
     Aminet)

*FishXref*
     is a cross reference list of the Fish contents.
     (`fish/doc/fishxref-???.lzh' on Aminet) FishXref and Fishcon are in
     Ascii format.

*KingFisher*
     A Fish disk database, (`fish/doc/Kingfisher1_30.lha', which is the
     program and `fish/doc/KFData850.lha' ,which contains the data, on
     Aminet or Fish disk 863) allows search by name and context. See
     Fish.

8.2. A collection of tests
==========================

   `Comp.sys.amiga.reviews' is a moderated newsgroup where tests of
soft- and hardware, books and anything else relevant to the Amiga are
posted. Its always a good idea to check this newsgroup for a review, if
you are interested in something special. Of course you always find only
the latest reviews, but the older postings are available per FTP from
`math.uh.edu', Directory `/pub/Amiga/comp.sys.amiga.reviews' or on the
Fish CDs.

8.3. Getting files from a FTP server
====================================

   Things are easy for those who have access to the Internet and a
program called FTP (File Transfer Program). Nearly all Unix computers
have it, but not all of them allow the use of FTP.

   FTP allows you to gain access to some other machines and store and/or
retrieve files. Normally one needs an acoount on the remote machine to
use it, bat a number of machines have a setup that allows everybody to
log in as the user `ftp' or `anonymous', so anybody may get files from
them. The most important of this servers are the Aminet servers, which
mirror each other and hence should have the same files. They are the
best choice if you are looking for Amiga software. Aminet hosts are
     ftp.luth.se		    (Sweden)
     ftp.eunet.ch                (Switzerland)
     litamiga.epfl.ch	    (Switzerland)
     ftp.uni-kl.de		    (Germany)
     ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de	    (Germany)
     ftp.uni-erlangen.de	    (Germany)
     ftp.uni-paderborn.de	    (Germany)
     ftp.th-darmstadt.de	    (Germany)
     ftp.uni-oldenburg.de        (Germany)
     ftp.cdrom.com   	    (USA)
     ftp.etsu.edu		    (USA)
     ftp.wustl.edu		    (USA)
     oes.orst.edu		    (USA)
     src.doc.ic.ac.uk	    (Great Britain)
   All these mirrors have a directory `/pub/aminet', where you will find
much stuff. Please use a mirror close to you! Some other important hosts
are
     ftp.funet.fi		 (Finland)
     ftp.isca.uiowa.edu       (USA)
     ftp.hawaii.edu           (USA)
     ftp.cso.uiuc.edu	 (USA)
     ftp.dfv.rwth-aachen.de	 (Germany)
   Note that grind, aachen and erlangen have the full collection of Fish
disks available! See Fish disk xxx.

   To connect to a special host (ftp.uni-erlangen.de for example), you
should type
     ftp ftp.uni-erlangen.de

The host answers by requesting your login. You should type
     ftp

No you are asked for a password. Please type your Email address here, if
you have one. If not, use the password ftp.

   Now you're inside the host. There is a number of commands you may
execute here. The most important are:
*?*
     Prints the help text of the FTP command. Additionally you may type
     *? command* to get information on a special command.

*bin*
     Tells the FTP program that you whish to transfer binary files. It
     is always a good choice to type bin as the very first command!
     Files you load without the bin command can be corrupt.

*get <file>*
     Loads the given file from the host. On most Unix machines you can
     type something like `get file.txt -' or `get file.txt |more' to
     show a text on the screen. Note that there *must* be no blank
     between the | and the word more!

*mget <pat>*
     Loads the given files. pat may contain Unix style like wildcards.

*put <file>*
*mput <pat>*
     Like get and mget, but transfer files from you to the remote host.
     This is in most cases not allowed, except for a special directory
     called `incoming'. You can place files here which you want to make
     public.

*cd <dir>*
     Like the usual cd command. The commands get, mget, put, mput, dir
     and ls refer to the current working directory.

*dir [<dir>]*
*ls [<dir>]*
     Like `list' and `dir' on the Amiga. Note that the FTP-dir
     corresponds to the Amiga-list!

*bye*
     Leaves the FTP program.

   When you have used FTP for the first times you will notice, that you
always begin with executing the same steps:
  1. Type the login (ftp in most cases)

  2. Type the password (your mail address in most cases)

  3. Enter the bin command

  4. Change the current working directory (`/pub/aminet' for example)
        This may get executed automatically. What you need is a file
called `.netrc' in your home directory. Note that it needs to be
protected against others! The FTP program doesn't use it, if it can be
read by anything else than you. (Protection is set using the command
`chmod go-rwx .netrc'.) The .netrc file contains some entries for your
most favourite FTP sites, each separated by empy lines. A typicel entry
may look like this:
     machine ftp.uni-erlangen.de
     login ftp
     password <your mail address> or <ftp>
     macdef init
         bin
         cd pub/aminet
   Note that on some machines it is possible to use the machine name
`default' which meets all machines not listed in .netrc.

8.4. Getting files from a Mail server
=====================================

   Another way to get files is to use a mail server. This assumes that
you can send mail to Internet addresses and get mail from Internet
hosts. It works by sending a mail to the server specifying some
commands, for example send commands for the files you want. Important
mail servers are
     ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
     mailserver@nic.funet.fi
     ftp-mailer@ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de
     mrcserv@janus.mtroyal.ab.ca
     mail-server@ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de
     mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu

The most important commands are:
*Help*
     Tells the server that you wish to get an Ascii file containing
     detailed explanation how to use the server.

*Limit <number>*
     Specifys that you wish to get not more than <number> Kbytes per
     mail.  Larger files get splitted into small pieces of at most
     <number> Kbytes which are sent as separate mails each. Note that
     the mails may get larger because of overhead.

*Cwd <dir>*
     Sets the current working directory to <dir>. This directory is
     used by the commands send and dir.

*Index*
     will return a list of files and/or directories that the server
     offers. Note that this may be *very* large!

*Index <item>*
     returns a list of files containing <item> in their names.

*Dir [<dir>]*
     returns a list of the files and directories in the given directory.

*Send <file1> <file2> ... <fileN>*
     Tells the server to send the given files to you.

*Begin*
     Tells the server to ignore all lines above this command.

*End*
     Like Begin, but specifies to ignore the lines below. (A signature
     for example!) A typical session would be to send the following
mail to the mail server:
     BEGIN
     CD /pub/aminet/util/arc
     SEND LhA_e138.run
     END

8.5. The Fish disks
===================

   A very good source are the Fish disks. One distinguishes between the
floppy disks and the CD-Roms.

8.5.1. The Amiga Library disks
------------------------------

   Fred Fish has started in the middle eighties to collect freely
distributable software on floppy disks. There are more than 900 disks
for now and very much good stuff on it. Most Amiga dealers sell them
and most magazines contain addresses of people mailing them to you for
about 3$ per disk or less.

   Fred Fish has announced to terminate offering software on floppy
disks with number 1000. Instead he offers CD-Roms. See Fish CD.

   There are some things which can be found on the Fish disks, but not
on Aminet.  However, you can get them with FTP. See Fish disk xxx.

8.5.2. The Fresh Fish CD-Roms
-----------------------------

   Fred Fish is going on to offer freely distributable software. But
now he collects it on CD-Rom's. He will release two different kinds of
CD's:
  1. Monthly released disks are divided into roughly three sections:
       1. New material, which includes the material from the new
          unreleased floppy disks as well as material which does not
          appear in the floppy distribution, about 84Mb on the first
          disk.

       2. Useful utilities that can be used directly off the CD-ROM if
          desired, thus freeing up the corresponding amount of hard
          disk space (GNU Emacs, Gnu C, GNU C++, Amiga E, PasTeX,
          AmigaGuide, Installer, 2.0 and 3.0-Includes, different
          archivers, tape drivers, the AmiCDROM filesystem and many
          other GNU and BSD tools, ...), about 150Mb on the first disk.

       3. Older material from previous released floppy disks or
          CD-ROM's, about 404 Mb on the first disk. (Fish disk 600-910)

  2. Disks containing the latest software as well as recent software in
     packed format only. (These are intended to be used for example in
     BBS's.)
        I recommend especially the first kind of Fish CD's. They cost
about 30$ plus 3$ for shipping (5$ outside USA/Canada/Mexico) and are
available from

     Amiga Library Services
     610 N. Alma School Road, Suite 18
     Chandler, AZ 85224-3687
     U.S.A.
     
     Phone/FAZ: (602) 917-0917

8.6. How do I Read and write MS-Dos disks?
==========================================

   No problem for owners of Workbench 2.1 or higher: The program
CrossDos is part of the Workbench. All you have to do is mounting the
device `pc0:' by putting it into the drawer `Devs:DOSDrivers' or by
double-clicking the icon in `Sys:Storage/DOSDrivers'. Ms-Dos disks in
drive `df0:' can now be handled in the usual manner replacing the word
`df0:' by `pc0:'. For example the directory can be shown with the
command dir pc0:.

   People still running Workbench 2.0 or lower need a program called
`MSH'.  You will find this on the Aminet (directory misc/emu) and on
Fish disk 382.  See Sources. After editing the file `devs:MountList' as
described in the documentation you have to say Mount msh: in the CLI
and can now do the same as above replacing the word `pc0:' with `msh:'.

8.7. How do I split large files?
================================

   There are some archives which are too large to fit on one disk. To
transfer them on disks you need to split them into smaller pieces and
transfer each part on a separate disk. I recommend Martin Schlodder's
`Splitter'.  (Aminet, `util/misc/splitter_121.lha'. The archive
contains binaries for MS-DOS and should be compilable without problems
on any Unix system.

The Amiga-FAQ archive
*********************

   The Amiga-FAQ is available in different formats: Ascii format (which
is posted to the nets) AmigaGuide format (which is the adequate format
on the Amiga) and in dvi format (to be printed). Additionally there is
some stuff, that might be useful or interesting, but could not be
included into the Amiga-FAQ:
     txt/amiga.history	On the Amiga's history
     txt/story.txt		The Commodore story (or: the Tramiel story ;-)
     txt/amiga.newsgroups	Overview on comp.sys.amiga.*
     txt/amiga.sites 	List of FTP sites
     txt/AmigaOverview.tex	A short overview on the Amiga-Soft- and Hardware
     txt/Hardware.tips	For those people who can't live without solder
     src/JWSplit.c		The source of a file splitter
     src/JWJoin.c		The opponent to JWSplit
     src/addtoc.c		Utility to add a toc to texinfo-created docs
     			(this document uses it)

   I decided to collect these in the Amiga-FAQ archive. It is called
AmigaFAQxxxxxx.lha (where xxxxxx is the date of the last release) and
can be found on Aminet, directory `text/docs'.

Contributions
*************

   This FAQ can neither get useful nor hit further development without
your help. Suggestions, contributions, new answers, critics, anything
is rather welcome.

   Please note, that very major subjects are absolutely missing yet:
Nothing about sound, nothing on graphic cards, no Animation. These are
some of the Amiga's best points! But I don't know them ... :-(

@node Best.About "Best and Worst Sports Games of All-Time"
THE BEST AND WORST SPORTS GAMES OF ALL TIME
===========================================

I have owned an Amiga since the very first shipments of 1000s came into my state and I 
had the first one reserved.  Since that time, I have been through several amigas, added 
many perhiperals, and played most every sports game.  The games are not listed in any 
particular order.  Please note that Flight Simulators/Combat games are categorized as 
sports games although they may not technically fit the definition.

The Best Sports Games of All Time

TV SPORTS FOOTBALL -- This was the most addictive football game ever when I first 
purchased it.  I played this game for about 20 hours straight.  It was way ahead of its 
time.  It has great graphics, great control, and full league schedules.  Unfortunately, at 
the time it was released, there were not many hard drives for the Amiga so this program 
is not hard drive installable.  It still is more fun than even Madden Football '94 for the 
Genesis and SNES.

TV SPORTS BASKETBALL -- This is by far the best basketball game available for any 
computer system.  Graphics, playability, and editing make it great fun.  This one is also 
hard drive installable and works on the 4000/040.

WINGS -- Yes, Cinemaware did it again with this great WWI airplane game.  You fly 
mission after mission during WWI of dogfights, bombing missions, and straffing runs.  
One of the best programmed videogames in history.

TEST DRIVE II -- The graphics now seem inferior on this game but when it first came 
out, it was superior in every way.  There are even European Scenery disks so you could 
race through Europe.  Keep your eye on the radar detector or you are busted.

SuperStar Ice Hockey -- Although I never liked Ice hockey, this game was 
completely addictive.  You own, manage, coach, and play for the team of your choice.  
You have to draft the best players, train them during the off-season, and learn when to 
trade your star players before you get old.  The real challenge is trying to keep a 
winning team once you have won a championship and your players start to age.

PGA TOUR GOLF -- This is the best golf game ever in my opinion for the Amiga.  Sure 
Links has better graphics but is not as fun.  You get to compete against all the top pros 
with a choice of 4 courses.  The graphics are good and it has great reverse reviews.  As 
soon as you hit the ball, it shows a reverse angle view of your ball.  It also features 
helicopter fly-by previews of the holes and keeps tracks of your stats.  A must have for 
any golf fan.


The Worst Sports Games of All Time

MAGIC JOHNSON BASKETBALL -- This is by far the worst sports game for the Amiga 
and perhaps the worst game ever.  The amazing thing is that Amiga World said it was a 
good game.  The graphics are lousy and the play is even worse.  It only plays off of 
floppies and every time someone takes a shot, you have to wait for the disk to be read 
before you find out if your shot went in or not.  This game is so bad that every Amiga 
user should try it once just so they realize how good the rest of the games are.

GREG NORMAN'S SHARK ATTACK -- A incredibly bad golf simulation.  The graphics 
were just terrible and the putting was even worse.  The courses are all flat and split up 
into grids which looked stupid.  The putting was instant.  You didn't even have to aim.  
You could easily make a 60 foot put without even aiming.

MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL -- The absolutely worst football game I have ever played.  
I would play the old Atari 4-bit two man football before I would try this again.  Words 
can't describe how bad it is.  To give you an idea, I had a friend send me some disks 
with some WB 3.0 utilities on it and he copied them right over his original disks of 
Monday Night Football.  Yep, the disks are worth more than the program.

FINAL WORDS

I would like to thank everyone for checking out this new on-line magazine and once 
again ask that people send in letters with questions, comments, or suggestions.  In 
order to make this on-line magazine successful, we must have the readers participation.  
I know I have stated this throughout the magazine, but I cannot overemphasize this.  I 
will not post the address again in this section since I have posted it most everywhere.  I 
would like to remind everyone once more that we need more writers for this magazine 
so that hopefully it will be much larger by the next issue.  We would also like to have 
advertisers.  If you work a company that sells Amiga magazines, let us know and we will 
be glad to include your catalog as part of this magazine.  We are also looking for small 
programs to distribute with each release.

I did hurry and create this first issue in a couple of days in order to hopefully gain 
interest in this magazine.  I plan to create each issue in a period of a couple of weeks 
after that.  I would prefer to just be the editor and write a couple of reviews or articles 
but it remains to be seen what type of response we will get.

As for Commodore's financial problems at the current time, I only have heard rumors 
about it and cannot confirm anything so I will avoid commenting on it until I hear some 
facts concerning the issue.  As long as the Amiga users continue to support the product 
and let people know they will not support second rate computers such as the IBM 486, 
then the Amiga market will always be alive.  Now is a good time to purchase a quick 
1000 shares of Commodore stock if you have the money and realize the risks involved.  
As of the writing of this article, the stock was no longer halted.

Thanks All,
Mike Schaper

Currently there are only two people working on this newsletter.  They
are Mike Schaper and John Cauthen.  We are just two Amiga Users who
love sports games.  John is more into racing and golf games while I
prefer football, baseball, and basketball games myself.  

I have an A4000/040 and John has a A1200 so we both are very much
interested in AGA programs.

How would YOU like to contribute to Amiga Addicts?  We certainly could use
more sports game addicts to help write articles.  If you are even

How do I get the Double-NTSC screen to work correctly?

I am sure many users who have bought an A1200 or A4000 have had difficulty getting 
the Double-NTSC screen mode to take up all of the screen.  There are many factors 
such as your monitor, drivers, and overscan settings. Here is a step by step check list 
that may help you out.

Step 1)  Make sure monitor is a multiscan and that it supports overscan.  Regular             
	   VGA/SVGA monitors will most likely not support the correct frequencies to work                  
	   in this mode.

Step 2) If your monitor has an double-width switch, then make sure that this is on.

Step 3) Put your Amiga in Double-NTSC and manually adjust the vertical and horizontal                                  
	   controls on the monitor itself.

Step 4) Select overscan from your prefs drawer and stretch it out as much as you can 	   
	  and then once again play with the monitors horizontal and vertical controls.

Step 5)  If you are still not satisfied, then download the file V39Disk.lha from an Amiga
	   support BBS.  I know the C= support bbs in Canada has this and so does the
	   AmigaMan BBS.  This disk has replacement drivers for the monitors and a
	   modified overscan control panel which allows you to stretch the screen more
	   and center it better.

Step 6) Download the file Moned214.lha from your favorite bbs.  I know this file is on
	   Genie.  This file will allow you to directly edit your monitor drivers.  I have heard
 	   of people successfuly getting their VGA monitors to work in DBL-NTSC with 
this
	   program.  Be careful with this program though since it is possible to destroy 	  
	   your monitor by misusing it.  

Step 7) If you still have a little of a border on the left or right side, then I would suggest 	   
	   grabbing the file BBlank.lha from Genie.  This file automatically blanks out the
	   left and right side of the screen for you that is not in use.

Step 8) If you are having even more difficulties now, then send email to me and list
	   your specific setup and I will see what I can come up with for you and post
	   it in the next issue.  

Step 9) Go out and buy as much Commodore stock as you can and hope the company
	   is bought out by a company with a marketing department.

@node Bo.About "Bo Jackson Baseball -- Review"
BO JACKSON BASEBALL (AKA TV SPORTS BASEBALL)

Bo Jackson Baseball is a solid baseball game that has good graphics, a friendly user 
interface, and good sounds.  However, it has one major problem.

You have your choice of any baseball team from any real major league city.  They are 
not the actual teams although you will notice many of the names resemble those of real 
players.  It would not be too difficult to modify a team so that you have the real players 
stats.  You have your choice of three difference ball parks.  One is a dome, one is a 
large indoor stadium, and one is a small indoor stadium where there are plenty of 
homers.  The batting is fun.  You can control the swing easily but yet it isn't too easy to 
hit a home run.  The fielding is easy to control although it can be difficult to catch those 
line drive balls that are sent to the outfield.  If you make a clean stop in the infield, you 
will have no problem throwing the runner out.  The problem with the game is with the 
pitching controls.   There is a aimer that moves back and fourth over the batters box 
fairly fast and you must throw the pitch while its right over the middle.  This is very 
difficult to do and is a very awkward way of of pitching.  The game really suffers 
because of this.  

The game plays fine on a stock 7mhz system and will install on your hard drive.  
However, users with only 512k of chip ram may have problems running it from the hard 
drive depending on how much chip ram is taken up.  

The game plays fine on an A2500 or stock system with Adspeed accelerator.
The game also plays fine on an A1200

A4000/040 users will have problems with this game.  The game will work fine from 
floppies if you disable the caches first and switch to the enhanced graphics mode.  If 
you leave the cache on, the game will be so fast that you will not be able to play it.  At 
least it was way to fast for me.  This game does NOT work from the hard drive on the 
4000/040 for some reason.  I have tried many different routines such as runlame, 
degrader, and disabling caches and it crashes every time.

Off Disk Protection.  Hard drive installable (except on 4000/040).

Rating: 6 out of 10

CONCLUSION:  This would be a much better game if the pitching routine was changed 
and it would work from the hard drive on an A4000/040.  These changes would lift its 
ratings from 6 to 8.

WINTER SUPERSPORTS '92 - Short Review

WS '92 is a surprisingly good game.  It is simply a update on the old Epyx Winter 
Games series.  It has pretty much the same events but the graphics are generally better 
than most of these games.  The Downhill skiing is one of the most fun in my opinion.  
You have three different courses to select from.  You have to avoid trees, rocks, and 
even occasional jumps.  It is a pretty tough event to master but fun.  The most 
interesting of the events is the barrel jumping.  You have to jump skate around using the 
joystick by moving right and left and keep up a good rhythm in order to build up speed.  
You then must jump over barrels once every lap.  It is extremely hard to keep your 
timing.  However, the event that sets is apart from many of the other winter games is the  
snowmobile racing.  You race around a tricky track in a snowmobile.  You have to watch 
out for the ice are you will be sliding everywhere.  This is a neat little game that never 
got much attention but is definitely worth a second look if you like the Winter Games 
type events.

Disk Protection.  Not Hard Drive Installable.

Rating: 7 out of 10

CONCLUSION:  A neat little game.  Not anything special but nevertheless fun.

4000/040 COMPATABILITY LIST

This was a list I was working on with conjunction with Mark Raymond of
Genie.  I plan on having an updated 4000/040 compatability List in every issue
of this magazine.  If anyone would like to do a 1200 compatability list,
then please do so and I will be glad to include it in future issues. Notice
that I marked the area that came from Mark Raymonds list and put his mailing
addressed below so any questions concerning his part of the list can be
addressed to him.

GUIDE
=====
AGA = Runs without modifying the 4000 in any way and takes advantage of
      the AGA chip set.
AGX = Runs without modifying the 4000 in any way (but the program does
      not take advantage of the AGA chip set).
ECS = Runs only when "Enhanced" mode is selected from the BOOTUP menu.
ORG = Runs only when "Original" mode is selected from the BOOTUP menu.
NCA = Runs when "No Cache" is selected from the BOOTUP menu or the CPU
      command is used to turn them off.
DEG = Runs when the Shareware program "Degrader 1.03" is executed.
NSU = Runs when "No Startup-Sequence" is selected from BOOTUP menu
      (usually means it runs when the 040 Library isn't running).
RLK = Runs when the program "ReloKick" is executed.
RLA = Runs when the program "RunLame" is used in a startup script.
XXX = Will not run no matter what I tried.

@node Lamb.About "Lamborghini Challenge -- Review"
LAMBORGHINI CHALLENGE

Warning:  Do not purchase this game if you already have Crazy Cars 3.  This is the 
EXACT SAME GAME.  Titus was bought out so this game was renamed to Lamborghini 
Challenge although it is the exact same game as Crazy Cars 3.  This review is officially 
of Crazy Cars III although it applies to LC also.

This version DOES NOT WORK on an A4000/040.  However, Crazy Cars 3 does.  I 
have no idea why CCIII does and LC does not.  I assume they changed some of
the calls.  

When Crazy Cars I came out, many Amiga magazines gave it great reviews so I went 
out and bought the game.  However, there is one problem with that game -- It sucked.  I 
never have purchased Crazy Cars II so I do not know if it any good.  Crazy Cars III got 
good reviews so against my better judgement, I purchased Crazy Cars III.  I was 
surprised when it turned out to be an excellent game.   It does resemble Crazy Cars I in 
any manner.

The object of CCIII is to race in many different parts of the country and collect enough 
prize money to enter races with bigger pots.  You also are racing against up to 4 
computer drivers who you can make side bets with before the race to increase the 
purse.  The graphics are very good.   It is a very smooth game and it runs fine on any 
stock Amiga.  There is no difference between running it on an A4000/040 and a stock 
1000.  You can also purchase different items such as radar detectors, better gripping 
tires, bigger engines, and even a new Lamborghini.  There are also turbo boosts that 
you can buy which can really help you out if you are way behind without much time left.  
Of course, they don't come cheaply.  There are four classes of racing.  In order to make 
it through each level, you must win enough races to earn the money to buy a ticket for 
the class challenge.  The ticket gives you three chances to make it through the 
challenge.  The challenge consists of trying to make it to the finish line in under a 
specified period of time.  The catch is that there are large trucks on the road and you 
have to swerve in and out of traffic to make it.  It is extremely challenging to conquer the 
challenge.  Once you have completed the challenge, you will have a bunch of new 
races to choose from in different parts of the country and you must once again win 
enough money to buy a ticket to the challenge. Each challenge stage becomes 
progressively more difficult.

The actual races have some unexpected obstacles such as police trying to knock you 
off the road or damage your car so much that you are forced to pull over.  There are 
also weather elements to deal with such as snow, rain, and ice.  Some courses have 
more police than others.  Some have no police at all.  Its always good to buy a radar 
detector as soon as you can.

This is an excellent arcade racing game with plenty to keep the avid racing gamer 
interested.  I recommend this game highly.  The only real drawback is that it is not hard 
drive installable.

Rating: 8 out of 10.

CONCLUSION:  Fast, Furious, and Fun!

Rumors, Rumors, Rumors

Sorry but this was just a cheap ploy to try to get some users interested in sending in any 
rumors of game related news so I can post it in the rumors section.  If you know if any 
sports games that may be translated to the Amiga, then please leave me some email so 
I can post it in this section.  Do you have a favorite game on the Genesis that you want 
to be translated to the Amiga?  If so, send the company a letter and then send me some 
email so I can post it in this section.  Remember, without the readers input, this on-line 
magazine will be mediocre at best.  We need all the users to contribute as much as 
possible.

@node 4D.About "4-D Driving -- Review"
4-D DRIVING

4-D driving is brought to you by the same team that made test drive and test drive II and 
is very similar to the Test Drive Series in control.  However, the game play is very much 
like Hard Drivin' or Stunts (on the IBM).  

You get to choose from several cars including a Lamborghini, Ferrari, Porsche.  There 
is even an Lamborghini four wheel drive jeep as well as a Porsche Indy Car.  After you 
have selected your car, you get to choose your opponent.  You can either choose an 
computer opponent with different levels of skill as well as the car he is driving. If you 
don't want to race anyone, you can select to race against the clock and try to beat your 
personal best.  The program does keep track of fastest times on each track as well as 
the car which was used.  Your next step is to select the track you want to drive on.  The 
game comes with several tracks and also has a track editor so you can create as many 
as your heart desires.  The default track is my personal favorite.  You have your choice 
of two paths to go through much like Hard Drivin'.  One of the tracks is mainly a speed 
track while the other has more stunts.  The stunts include bridges, jumps, split roads, 
loops, elevated roads with turns, sharp turns, as well as many more.  Controlling your 
car can seem difficult at first but the controls are more realistic than most games.  The 
graphics are good.  They are nothing special.  If you have an A2500 or better, the game 
looks great in full detail.  You will see buildings, boats, windmills, and many other items.  
There is also a great instant replay feature where you can review your run with VCR like 
controls and view it from a helicopter angle.  I have more fun watching some of my 
crashes than actually playing the game.  

4D Driving runs excellent on an 4000/040 with no speed problems at all.  It does not run 
too fast either.  On a stock 500/600/1000/2000 the game is a little too slow and it will not 
allow you to turn the detail up unless it finds a 68020 or better processor.  The game is 
fair on an stock Amiga with Adspeed accelerator but you still will not be allowed to 
select maximum detail.  It is a little bit too slow on an A1200 also although it is very 
playable.  This is a excellent game on any machine with a 68030 or better but may have 
a very limited market due to the speed requirements.

Hard Drive Installable.  Off-Disk Manual Protection.

4000/040 Users.  You must boot with no start-up-sequence and select enhanced 
graphics in order to get this to play from your hard drive.  It is worth this little bit of 
hassle.

Rating: 8 out of 10.

CONCLUSION:  If you have an '030 or better, this is a great driving game that will give 
you many hours of pleasure.

@node Introduction.About "Welcome to AA Volume 1 Issue 1"

WELCOME TO AA Volume 1 Issue 1

Welcome to the first issue of AA (Amiga Addicts Online Magazine).  The reason I have 
started to write this bi-monthly newsletter is because there is a lack of quality reviews of 
sports games on the Amiga.  Major publications such as Amiga world don't give quality 
reviews of programs which can be annoying.  They seem to rate programs from A to 
C+.  The worst case scenario was when Amiga World described Magic Johnson's 
basketball as being a good game.  MJB was perhaps the worst basketball game ever 
created for any computer system.  I have always been active in sports myself and I love 
watching most sports on television.  A good sports game is the greatest 
accomplishment in computer games in my opinion.  This newsletter is intended for 
those users who share my enthusiasm for sports.  

The first issues of this magazine will review mainly older games.  I will not go out and 
buy every single new sports game just for this magazine.  However, if anyone who en-
joys this newsletter would like to send me any new sports game, I would gladly review it 
and return the program to you as soon as I am finished reviewing it.  The only condition 
is that I must have the ORIGINAL program with manuals and the hopefully the box.  I 
will only review programs from original copies and will not resort to testing pirated cop-
ies of software.  Besides, it is not fair to review something that is not complete.

Lastly, I will tell you a little about the system I am using.  I have an Amiga 4000/040 with 
10 megs of ram.  Hopefully, this is more than enough ram to run any sports games.  I 
have plenty of hard drive storage (currently 840 megs).  I have one hi-density floppy 
drive (internal) and one low-density floppy drive (external).  I am using a CTX multi-scan 
monitor which is set in Double-NTSC for any games that mode promote.  I use 
Softwoods' Final Writer as my word processor, CygnusEd as my text editor, and a 
couple of programmers tool to convert the Final Writers documents into the AmigaGuide 
format.

Please feel free to send me internet email or Genie Mail if you have any comments, 
suggestions, questions, or would like to help review sports game.

Enjoy,

@node tlsfde.About "Tom Landry Special Edition Football"

TOM LANDRY STRATEGY FOOTBALL DELUXE EDITION

I am going to review Tom Landry Strategy Football Deluxe Edition because in the May 
'94 issue of Amiga World, it was given an A-.  I will tell you right off hand that I give this 
game a D rating.  On a scale of 1 to 10, this game gets a 3.

TLSFB is not an arcade football simulation but rather an strategy game.  You get to be 
the coach of the team of your choice and you select all the plays are just setup your 
team and have the computer play the games for you.  It is to football what Earl Weaver 
is to baseball.  However, Earl Weaver was fun.  TLSF has a good bit of strategy but the 
game is just not fun and football is by far my favorite sport.  The graphics on the game 
are just awful.  The graphics remind me a lot of some of the atari 4-bit video game 
graphics.  The players look very crowded and the field view is a joke.  If you call every 
play of the game, you will be very disappointed and probably bored.  It is better to  
choose the option of choosing what percentage of run and pass you want to use and 
have the computer play the game for you.  The game will show you all of the scored as 
they happen with the amount of time left in the game.  It will probably take a couple of 
minutes to complete the game and then look at all the stats.  

On the plus side, TLSFB does come with a league editor.  You can setup real NFL 
divisions, college divisions, high school, semi-pro, or whatever type of league you want.  
I am glad that this is included in the game, but it doesn't make up for the lack of good 
football strategy.  Unfortunately, it comes with Generic city teams which cover all the 
major NFL cities but they didn't bother to buy the rights to the NFL teams so you will 
have to create the teams yourself or hope someone actually takes the time to create 
them and uploads them to your favorite bbs.  They would have been much better off if 
they would have just named it Strategy Football and bought the NFL rights for the real 
teams and left out the Tom Landry name which does not benefit the program in any 
way.

The game is hard drive installable and has off-disk copy protection.  

Conclusion:  Don't waste your money on this game.  There are numerous football 
games much better than this.
