The File AA1-1.guide is in AmigaGuide Format.  You must have AmigaGuide
installed on your workbench in order to use the Amigaguide.  It can be
viewed as a text file although I would not recommend this.  You also need
to have the PD program ViewTech named VT and in your C: directory in
order to view the graphics.

This Online Magazine may be freely distributed so long as the contents
of the archive are not changed.  The Original file should include:

aa1-1.guide  		114559
aa1-1.guide.info        5165
title.pic    		32992
readmefirst  		566

Enjoy,
