<UL>Alexander Dorn posts a 6k article speaking about software development
not being dead, but merely waiting; VRML not being useful on Amigas;
NewTek just waiting for memory management, weird rumours of AI hiring
Irving Gould and Medhi Ali for OS developments; Gateway 2000 barely
knowing the word Amiga at its purchase; the need for hope; a future
for the Amiga as a fact; about licensing of low-end machines; a new
OS in November... [I really can't go into details, check out the original
posting.]

<UL>In reply to the recent disclosure of a &quot;standardized&quot; cover plate and
serial number on AmigaOS 3.1, Olaf Barthel says there are only a natty
hologram and a seal proclaiming <CITE>&quot;Guaranteed to be at least four years old&quot;</CITE>

that their products are old and badly need to see updating, rather than
licensing. He also remarks that AI seem to have resurrected the Boing! ball.

<UL>The Amiga has become a bit of a kludge, with patch over patch.
These are potential problems when running Amiga software, but
brought to life as third-party add-ons while the Amiga was trapped

a means of <CITE>taking a machine that was not being advanced [..]

then adds a <CITE>Shakespeare Rant</CITE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>To PPC, or not to PPC, that was the question (was it not?)<BR>
Weather 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer the slow processing speeds<BR>

<UL>Colin Ward is posting a rather long article where he says that
Amiga programming has become worse since MUI. <CITE>Can anyone

Colin thinks MUI is killing the Amiga, because it enforces bad
programming. He recalls the <CITE>old days</CITE> where everything
needed to be programmed without any flaw or the program would crash
and that nowadays programming MUI is so easy that people don't
even think about testing their programs before releasing them.
<CITE>We either have to get rid of MUI or develop
some tools that will allow us, as users and programmers, to detect
incorrect usage of it, in a global attempt to raise the standard of
software reliability.</CITE>

<UL>Thorsten Stocksmeier is once again the victim of a pirate.
He received feedback from an English guy who sent a keymaker
for Thorsten's Shareware program FFNews. He also included a
cracked version of the program that neither shows its registration
state nor a key number. <CITE>Piracy where I look in the Amiga &quot;community&quot;.</CITE>
Thorsten's original subject was <CITE>Anyone who buys shareware key files is a dumb idiot</CITE>...
[Is that ironical or do people really think that way?]

<UL>Hal Greenle, former NASA employee posts details about the Amiga
system used at NASA's Hangar AE in Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
<CITE>These systems process launch vehicle and spacecraft data from the Centaur and
Delta launch vehicles, and sometimes assist with Shuttle data.</CITE>
Currently, they are using A4000 motherboards in MicroniK towers kits
with Warp engines, but they also used A2000's and A1000's before.
Hal says more information is available in an article he did
for Amiga Computing issue August 96.

<UL>Olaf Barthel says enhancing CygnusED is pretty hard, because it was
built upon <CITE>hard design principles</CITE> that are nearly impossible
to change. Basically, CygnusED is <CITE>just one blazingly fast text
display engine with editing features glued to it.</CITE> It will probably
never offer features like syntax colouring or plug-in API, as that would
be too hard to implement into the existing code. Apparently, most of the
50k of suggestions he received already <CITE>circle around turning CygnusEd into
GoldEd</CITE>, which is obviously not possible.

software development at second place (better software development tools too,

at third place, <CITE>a surprise</CITE> [whatever that means]. In
his own words, Timothy summarises this as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The first of the priorities is already showing productive results in
new hardware product value for the consumer. The second will address
software development needs, bringing new software value to and by the
users. The third, well it's a supprise. One which will be keep quite

happen? Then the third can't.</BLOCKQUOTE>
