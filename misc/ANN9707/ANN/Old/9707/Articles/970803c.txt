It's the only remotely plausible reason I've heard for Gateway wanting
AI to fail. However, they need to be pretty desperate to do this, because
it makes no sense unless they buy the company at a bargain price, so that they
can claim that the company's assets are worth more at the time it ceases
trading. I admit I don't quite understand the concept either.

Just one thing though: If Gateway were that greedy for the money, why
didn't they just cash in on the merger with Compaq instead of worrying
about the company's status ?
