dear Colin,

your post was asimed as if being against MUI......buit it wasnt.

there is nothing wrong with MUI - we should embrace the system. whats
wrong is - as you pointed out - some of the people using it.

There need to be tighter control on MUI programs......maybe the source
code sent to MUI examiners to check/optimize/bug report.

they shouldnt do the work, they should say "hey, you cant release this
yet"

Beta testing - hell, even gamma testing , has recently gone to pot. 
utils are no longer thougholy tested before release. they should be
