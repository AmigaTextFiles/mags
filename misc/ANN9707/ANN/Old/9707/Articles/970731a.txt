For me it answers nothing. Either gw2k invest the millions of dollars
required in a new AmigaOS, or they dont. I know what their actions say
so far. (And yeah, its early, sure sure, but it doesn't look good from
my perspective).

Um, you're a bit late in pointing this out, seeing as there was a small
thread on all of this in comp.sys.amiga.misc nearly a month ago!..

But it's appreciated that you/someone(?) actually took time to type it out
for others..

Did ANYONE notice one word strangely MISSING from this text? The word is
PATENTS.. Strange how they could actually leave out their, now admitted,
'initial' reason for purchasing Amiga, huh? I guess that was just an
'oversight' or something.. NOT!..

They can blow as much hot air as they like. Until I see their cash &
effort I will believe AI is simply there to flog a dead horse (68k
technology) for its last few days, leasing to any willing third parties,
and doing nothing for the future of the Amiga.. Perhaps doing some
kind of link up with pOS or Phase5 or something at VERY best..

Rather than a pessimistic attitude, I see this as a 'common sense' one,
unless I'm told otherwise - By Gateways money and actions..

3 months and still nothing.. Even one little statement saying 'YES, we
will make a new Amiga OS, but the direction has yet to be decided'.
This would give people optimism, without entering into concrete
commitments. However, seeing as they cant even do this, it leads one to
conclude that the reason is because they have no such plans of their
own, and aren't willing to fund such plans. Let's hope they prove me
wrong.. Remember the longer they leave it, the smaller the Amiga user
base becomes..
