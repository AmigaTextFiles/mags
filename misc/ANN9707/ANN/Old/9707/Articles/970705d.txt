Okay, thanks Hans.  I think that was my cue.  ;-)

On May 13, 1997 (not a friday), DEC sued Intel for wilful infringement in the
designs of all Pentium, Pentium Pro, and Pentium II processors of 10 of DEC's
microprocessor patents that have been instrumental in boosting the Alpha and VAX
processor families' performance over the past decade or so.  Among other things,
DEC CEO Robert Palmer explained that morning that DEC and Intel had talks during
1990 and into 1991 about Intel's adopting the Alpha as their future 64-bit
architecture.  Intel declined, as we all know.  During this time, Intel
apparently had access to design documents detailing these patents.

DEC demands triple damages and an injunction to stop Intel from selling any of
these processors in the future, or instructing people on how to use them.  You
read that right:  The court can forbid Intel from selling any of their processor
models released from 1991 to 1999!  Just how large the triple damages sum is is
not known.  When asked, however, Robert Palmer explained that the sum is
``huge''.  This is a rare thing:  If the lawsuit were only a tactical move
(not exactly DEC's style anyway), it would have been expedient to emphasize how
reasonable the sum was.  Usually a quiet and dependable beast, DEC is angry and
showing its teeth this time.  As their slogan goes, "whatever it takes".

Industry analysts estimate the requested damages payment at around
12,000,0000,000 to 15,000,000,000 US dollars (go buy yourself an ice cream from
THAT), compared to Intel's total Pentium profits of around 20,000,000,000
dollars.

When asked if this matter had been discussed with Intel CEO Andy Grove, Robert
Palmer replied that they had talked already, hadn't they, back in '90/'91 and
since Andy was in a different timezone, there was no sense in waking him up to
tell him now.  He was sure to see the fax and email when he woke up.

It would have been interesting to see Andy's face that morning...  And in the
afternoon as well:  That was when he heard that Cyrix, too, is suing Intel for
patent infringement.  For more details, see my previous posts on the subject
(eg. by browsing to http://www.dejanews.com and searching for the combination of
my name and the words Intel, DEC, and patent.
