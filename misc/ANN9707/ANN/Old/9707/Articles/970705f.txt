Having been in the AI offices I can at minimum confirm that they have an 
Amiga demo room with quite a lot of Amiga kit in it.  They also have some 
Gateway 2000 PC's for administration as you might expect.

We are dependent on Amiga's for our income, but I am not so blind that I 
think the Amiga is the best product for everything.  The Amiga is the best 
product for a range of things, however as an office machine it doesn't 
have the breadth of software and certainly not the compatibility with 
everyone else.
