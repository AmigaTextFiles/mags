In reference to Paul Kolenbrander's message regarding 2000's at Hangar AE,
Cape Canaveral:

I worked there and participated in the selection of Amigas for replacement
of an old 8-bit minicomputer.  I evaluated and purchased much of the equipment
over the 1987-1994 period.  We started with 1000's, Hurricane accelerators,
and Byte-by-Byte PAL 1000 accessory boxes.  The first disk drives were ST-506,
but we later upgraded our Zorro I 2090 disk controller cards to SCSI.

The second version of the systems were 2000's with 2630's, 2632's and Rocket
Launchers (1990).  The present version is 4000 motherboards in Micronik tower
kits with Warp Engines.  Interface boards were designed for each version to
get high-speed data into and out of the Amiga.

These systems process launch vehicle and spacecraft data from the Centaur and
Delta launch vehicles, and sometimes assist with Shuttle data.  This data is
displayed in the Hangar AE telemetry station during the typical month or so of
pad tests and during launch, and is also transmitted to a number of remote
sites.  This off-line station has more room for engineers than the blockhouse,
and is crowded during tests.  It is not located on Kennedy Space Center
proper, but rather on the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

An article I did on the history of AE and Amigas was published in Amiga
Computing, August 96.  Email me if more info desired.
