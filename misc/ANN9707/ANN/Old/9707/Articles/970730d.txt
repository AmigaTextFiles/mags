I'm not arguing the Amiga's superiority in the '80s and the early
'90s.

They don't _seem_ as good because you refuse to build a balanced system
consisting of quality components, something that you have to do with
an Amiga in order to make it usable, too. My PC is ancient in terms of
pure CPU power (100 MHz Pentium with a motherboard that was released
in mid-94!), but beats many cheap 200 MHz systems in terms of ergonomy,
usability and stability. Why? Because of the display (1280x1024x24,
80 Hz), memory (96 MB), disks (7200 RPM SCSI, _no_ IDE), CDROM (3 MB/s
peak), 4mm DAT streamer, high-quality sound card, high-quality keyboard,
high-quality mouse (3 buttons :-), quality OS (NT/Linux, _no_ Win95/DOS).
It's the peripherals that account for the perceived power of a given
system, not so much the actual CPU speed. Of course, you have to approach
any alien system open-mindedly, or you'll always find a reason to hate it.

Assuming that you are right, why don't they answer dumb anti-Amiga
propaganda with educated, rational and substantiated followups?

On a P200 (a $99 chip), UAE feels like a slow A3000 (even the artifacts
when scrolling in interlaced mode are emulated authentically). I hope
that by the end of the year, a virtual graphics card will increase
application performance and allow for arbitrary resolutions and color
depths beyond 4 bit.

This depends on too many parameters to be answered with a single number.
However, here is a very rough, conservative sample calculation that is
in accordance with reality:

a = average number of x86 instructions per 68K instruction: 40
b = average number of x86 instructions per clock cycle: 1.2
c = average clock cycles per 68000 instruction: 3

Assuming a 100 MHz host CPU, the virtual 68000 runs at a speed of

100 MHz/a*b*c = 9 MHz

UAE will spend a lot of time in the custom chip emulation if the frame
rate is below 50 Hz. Note that the frame rate cannot get any higher
than that, beyond which the M68K emulation benefits from all surplus
host CPU power in a non-linear manner. Therefore, you cannot linearly
scale speed estimates.

Assuming little screen activity, somewhere between a 10 and 20 MHz
68030, i.e. usable, but not really snappy (file system access will
be comparatively fast, by the way).

UAE won't benefit much from the second CPU, but a PPro-200 is exactly the
type of CPU UAE starts making sense on. I wish I had a version of gcc that
produces code which takes maximum advantage of the PPro/PentiumII.

Assuming that all Amiga software performs legal operations, UAE is perfectly
stable.

Try UAE on your PPro-200 and see if it fits your needs.
