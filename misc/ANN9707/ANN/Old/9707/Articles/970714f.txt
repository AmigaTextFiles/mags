Amiga International License Intrinsic Computer Systems to Manufacture A1200
based Computers

 OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT

9th July 1997

Since 1995 ICS have been at the forefront in developing expansion systems that
enable A1200 and A4000 users to make the best use of Hard Drive and CD Rom
technology. Their MMS tm Technology has made it possible for the Amiga to
utilise up to four EIDE devices.

In a not surprising announcement ICS have been awarded a license to produce
A1200 based tower systems. Micronik and Index Information Ltd have already been
granted licenses and it was only a matter of time that the leaders in multimedia
technology for the Amiga would follow suit. The new A1200 tower system will be
called the Amigo PC range.

"We know that the Amiga is the best machine available for the home and
professional user. Its operating system is far superior to that of Wintel and
Mac based machines and that's the reason why we don't develop for any other
platform. Amiga OS is far more efficient in the areas of memory, resources and
hard disk storage than any other operating system. The future of the Amiga has
now become very exciting and we were very pleased when we heard the announcement
that Micronik, Index Information Ltd and then ourselves had been awarded
licenses to produce Amiga based systems" - Barry Turner of Intrinsic Computer
Systems.

In Amigo PC will be supplied in various configurations:

 *  StormA1200 based tower system
 *  CycloneA1200 based tower system, 68030 50Mhz CPU with 16 or 32Mb
 *  TornadoA1200 based tower system, 68060 50Mhz CPU with 16 or 32Mb
 *  HurricaneA1200 based tower system, PPC603e 200Mhz with 16 or 32Mb
 *  They will all have the option of Hard Drive and CD Rom Drive.

 An example of a "Fully Loaded" system would be:

Hurricane HC A1200, tower with 2Gb Hard Drive,£1699.95 16x CD Rom Drive, PPC603e
200Mhz, 34Mb ram, expansion bus, graphics card and monitor.

Every Amigo PC will be bundled with either three new professional software
packages or three new games never seen before on the Amiga, these have been
supplied by Alive Media Soft who have now transfered several games from the
Macintosh and PC to the Amiga platform.

"Although the license is only an interim one that does not allow ICS to use the
Amiga name on its products for the next 12 months, the best personal computer
there is has just got better" - Barry Turner, Intrinsic Computer Systems.
