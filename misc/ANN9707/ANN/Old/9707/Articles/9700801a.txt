Well, we have started to ship out pre-production Access units and we have 
the first firm production order from the first company to receive one...  
It is not a retail product, however it is a new full blown licensed 
"Powered by Amiga" motherboard.  I guess this is the first new Amiga 
design to ship for a few years.  From current enquiries we expect to have 
more than sold our 1st years target for the Access.

Gateway have changed the manager within GW for AI, they have also been 
beavering away on the strategy.
