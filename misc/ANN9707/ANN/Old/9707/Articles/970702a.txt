In the end, you have to make your own decision.

However, if I was Gateway I would think really long and hard about any
sort of trade-in policy.  Initial Amiga sales in the consumer market are
dollars to donuts going to be to existing Amiga users, so a trade-in
almost amounts to an outright price reduction for everyone.  There's also
the question of: what would they DO with your old Amiga?  Certainly, there
are outlets for used Amigas and parts in the marketplace, but not very
lucrative ones.
