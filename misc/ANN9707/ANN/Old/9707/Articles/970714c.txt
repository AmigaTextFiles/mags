   Provided everybody is happy with the changes I can make to the program,
which is pretty darn tough to start with. Don't expect miracles, CygnusEd is
what it is today due to design principles that are hard, if not impossible
to change. I already have about 50K worth of enhancement requests, bug reports,
etc. in my mail folder which more or less circle around turning CygnusEd into
GoldEd. That's no way to go with CygnusEd, I'm afraid. Useful bits like syntax
colouring or a plug-in API are not that easily implemented because CygnusEd
is basically just one blazingly fast text display engine with editing features
glued to it.
