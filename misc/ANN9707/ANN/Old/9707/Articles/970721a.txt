Subject ........: Survey results: A/BOX or PIOS. p/OS new AmigaOS?

Hi,
the new AMIGA SURVEY RESULTS ARE OUT. The question was "Which
system will succeed the legendary Amiga? - The A/BOX, the PiosONE,
the Wintel-Empire...?"

Come on, and have a look at the interesting results.

btw- THERE IS A NEW SURVEY! So, even if you've already voted,
you can now vote a second time "for the Amiga's future"!

The question: "Should pOS be the new Amiga operating system?"

You haven't voted at all? Come to
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/3680/amiga.html
It's very easy and fast. 

I hope this is interesting for all of you.
Bye,
 Tobias

P.S. If you've got an Amiga Homepage, too, why don't you include a link
to the Amiga Survey Page? Thanks.
