Subject ........: Burger King sighting

After a terrific boozeup last night, I got myself a cup of coffee at Burger King
before taking the train home.  My train wasn't due for another ten minutes, and
it was late on a sunday night, so there was little else to do but stare at the
big video screens that constantly showed promotional videos, movie shots, and
Burger King logos.

Then I noticed a familiar-looking mouse pointer in the upper left-hand corner of
the screen.

No doubt about it:  It was the standard Amiga mouse pointer over a genlocked
video background!  Occasional Amiga graphics were mixed in as well, and I could
see the pointer change colours on some occasions.  Probably as a result of
NTSC-to-PAL conversion, it was placed just outside the actual picture in a
narrow black horizontal strip on the top like you get with "letterbox format"
movies.  Maybe that was also the reason why the pointer accidentally remained
visible.

Of course I asked the girl behind the counter what she knew about the computer
used for the displays (working the night shift at the train station as she did,
she must have been used to drunk people asking weird questions) and she told me
that it was a video tape, and that these tapes were created centrally and
distributed to the franchises.

So, here's what I'd like to know:  Has anybody else seen this, or was it just my
bad habits taking toll?  Anybody who happens to know that BK uses Toasters or
something like that?

If all franchises all over Europe are showing that mouse pointer right now, this
may be the time for Amiga fans to walk into the nearest Burger King, point at
the screen, and say "see that?  That's my baby!"  :-)
