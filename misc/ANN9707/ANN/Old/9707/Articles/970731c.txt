   On the subject of "not quite legal": Amiga International has just started
to stamp out illegal sale of AmigaOS 3.1 by means of a "standardized" cover
plate and a serial number. There are only two bits missing: a) a natty
hologram, b) a seal proclaiming "Guaranteed to be at least four years old".
a) is probably missing because the hologram would be more expensive than the
disks and b) is probably missing because nobody at Amiga International has
noticed yet how old their products and how badly they need to see updating
rather than "licensing".
   Oh, by the way: has anybody noticed that Amiga International has
resurrected the Boing! ball? I wonder whether *this* is legal.
