Ok, concretely running on my amazing little A1200 uptime monster
(A1200HD AT, AmigaOS 3.1, 4 MB PCMCIA RAM card): Dillon AmigaUUCP 1.16,
AmigaBasic 2.0 Alpha (still has a long bug list, but controllable
and avoidable ones, or not fatal), a lot of AmigaDOS utilities
from the C: directory in scripts, sometimes PPaint 6.4,
CrossDos heavily, NCOMM (ancient), sometimes Voodoo (e-mail) for
MIME mail, plus some others I currently forgot.

But the above just don't, in *this* setup. Perhaps in some other
environment (060 processor?) all hell might break loose. Anyway,
I can do all my news and e-mail with this setup. (But some of my
e-mail I do from my Win95 PC via a different account.)

And it seems time again to mention (I have done this earlier, too)
that I have nothing *against* MP. But it appeared to me that its
introduction into 68k AmigaOS were plain impossible, from all the
discussions we had about that. And so I concluded not to die in
desperation but to remain aware that it's also possible to live
without it, *if you cannot get it*. Now that the PPC is coming, this
has to be reconsidered. Perhaps MP can be introduced on this occasion.
Sure I would not like to have the performance suffer from it (keyword
being message copying instead of passing), but this can hopefully be
resolved.

Sure. There are sometimes three copies of AmigaBasic running
(it can't multithread several Basic sources from one interpreter,
forgive it, it's from MS)...

Nothing secret, just plain, boring, working stuff to get work done.
