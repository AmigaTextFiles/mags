John Dvorak puts forth a theory in his latest column in PC magazine.
According to Dvorak, Gateway was offered $7 billion by Compaq.  Dvorak
thinks Gateway turned it down because of Intel.  You see, Intel is not 
comfortable with Compaq's size, and Compaq has refused to use Intel
MB's and chip sets in the manufacture of their machines.  Then there's
the matter of Compaq funding NexGen to develop what is now AMD's K6,
a Pentium challenger.

The theory continues that Intel offered Gateway price incentatives to keep
Compaq out or that Intel itself may be in purchase negotiations with Gateway,
Intel is known to be considering coming out with Intel branded PC's.

If any of this is true, it certainly raises new possibilities about Gateway's 
reasons for purchasing Amiga.
