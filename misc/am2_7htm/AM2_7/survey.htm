<P ALIGN="LEFT">I was contacted about this, AmiSurvey 97, a couple of months ago, and so decided to participate. Recently, I received the results via e-mail.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The survey was developed by James Ossi and Roger Hagensen (<A HREF="mailto:emsai@online.no">emsai@online.no</A>), posted at <A HREF="http://home.sol.no/~msi/amiga/index.htm">http://home.sol.no/~msi/amiga/index.htm</A>, and publicized via Usenet and Aminet (docs/announce:Emsai Survey). With permission of the survey's creators, we are publishing in full the results here (below the horizontal rule, and left unedited) for the period from August 1st through December 31st, 1997.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It would be editor-ish of me to do an analysis, but I think I'll let the results speak mostly for themselves. I will note, however, as James Ossi pointed out to me, that the trend seems to be towards higher-end Amiga configurations. That makes sense, since the people who filled out the survey are all online, and it takes a fairly up-to-date Amiga to run modern Internet software.</P>
