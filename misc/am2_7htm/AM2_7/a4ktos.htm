<P ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, probably the majority of you reading this now are using AmigaOS 3.1. So it's by no means news. On the other hand, probably no operating system can claim to equal AmigaOS for a balance of terrific power and capability with resource-efficiency. I therefore think the OS is always worthy of mention, especially in the context of a powerful new machine like the A4000T.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One of the first things that struck me when I had first powered up the A4000T was that it didn't really seem faster than my A500/A530 system. There was a very good reason for this, however; AmigaOS 3.1 is so fast on a 68030 that the difference achieved by using a 68060 isn't terribly dramatic. At least, that is, until you start demanding more of the machine, in which case the 68060 shines; otherwise, however, the OS simply blazes.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I have been using this platform for a great many years, and I gain new respect for the ingenuity that went into the operating system all the time, especially lately. This system was, and is, so far ahead of its time, it's not even funny; there's no other way to it. And oddly enough, I have had the vast majority of my experience with other operating systems in only the last few years.</P>


<BR><BR>


<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">The "Competition"</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When I say I've used a variety of operating systems, I mean it; I saw MS-DOS 6 and Windows 3.1 grow up on the 486, followed by the Pentium explosion and Windows 95. I used OS/2 Warp for some time, and I currently use Windows NT occasionally. More recently, I have gained experience with various versions of Mac OS as well. I've used most of these on "fast" and "slow" systems alike, such qualifiers generally carrying meaning only in the eye of the beholder, especially these days.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But yes, I've used all these operating systems, and in my opinion, <I>not a one of them</I> can <I>begin</I> to compare to AmigaOS. Nobody else seems to be able to figure out how to do it. The only one of the lot listed above that I would chance to call "fast" is MS-DOS, and it's so limited in capability it <I>is</I> funny. The rest are dog-slow. OS/2 is probably the best of the multitaskers in many ways, but it seems to poke along at a good crawl no matter how fast the CPU.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As I see it, there is one way in which any of these operating systems is superior to AmigaOS, and that is "feature count." Yes indeed, with Windows 95 you've got every gadget and gizmo you could possibly need or want...but why is it that both cinematic and technological history suggest that the most innocent-looking "Gizmos" often have the propensity to turn into very nasty "Gremlins...?" Features do not an operating system make. A powerful operating system is fast, lightweight, modular, extensible, multitasking, intuitive, and user-friendly. It's kind of cumbersome to manage that list of attributes, though, so why don't we just change the definition of "Good Operating System" to "AmigaOS?" :)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Seriously, in my opinion, nothing can touch AmigaOS. Nothing even comes close. Yes, I could probably do what I need to do with a Windows machine, but it would be far less satisfying, and generally much more frustrating, than doing the same things under AmigaOS. Believe me, I've been there. Windows 3.1 was reasonbly quick (though not especially spritely), but trying to multitask under it generally made me want to scream. Windows 95 multitasks better, but it is <I>so</I> ponderous. Even if you run it on a fast machine, it hogs resources, and under heavy multitasking, <I>will</I> become a nuisance, and occasionally approach "unusable" status. Windows NT is a more solid system, but just booting it cuts my PC's Norton SysInfo number (a performance indicator) in half. The computer industry seems to be hung up on the idea that lots of nice little features can result in a great operating system. Don't get me wrong; there are some added features I think AmigaOS could definitely use. But it already has the speed, and the power. The other operating systems do not. This is essentially why I use AmigaOS; it may be bare-bones, but at least it has a solid foundation.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I just can't help wondering how all the consumers out there who have seen nothing but Windows and Mac OS over the years would react to something with the power of AmigaOS. Well, actually, I don't have to wonder; I've seen it for myself, whenever a Mac- or PC-only friend takes a look at what my A4000T (or even A500/A530) can do. It's always good for a show, anyway.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Anyway, that's enough OS ranting for now. It's an old story by now anyway, and AmigaOS is probably the Amiga platform's greatest single asset as it proceeds boldly into the future.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">AmigaOS Next Generation?</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Speaking of the future, I'd like to give a general outline of where I hope to see the OS go from here.</P>

<UL>
<LI>The item at the top of my list is simple enough: don't change it! Not much, anyway. You see, AmigaOS is already an outstanding operating system. It does not have to be overhauled, or rewritten, or anything of the sort. What it could use is some tuning-up.
<LI>If we must have resource tracking/memory protection/crash protection, it should be an option that can be enabled or disabled. Personally, I'd rather do without it completely. But, I would be willing to compromise in this manner. The problem with resource tracking etc. is not only that it slows things down so much, but also that it gives programmers a crutch. Under Windows, a trouble application might not bring down your whole machine, but it will still bring itself down, no matter how much the OS can protect the rest of the system. In my experience, however, AmigaOS and its applications actually seem more stable than various OS's I've used that include resource tracking.
<LI>Virtual memory is useful, and AmigaOS should include support for it. However, it should <I>not</I> be turned on by default, and the user should be able to disable it completely if do desired. There musn't be full-time VM; under certain conditions, this feature can bring the speed of the whole system down to that of the hard disk. We don't need that; leave it up to the users' choice.
<LI>Workbench probably needs the most attention. Logical additions are fairly common-sense; Workbench could use graphical status indicators, multithreading, an ARexx port, etc. Features such as icon align-to-grid, and something along the lines of ToolManager and ToolsDaemon built-in would greatly enhance power and usability.
<LI>I wouldn't want to see MUI or anything like it "just thrown in," but some of the ideas it embodies need to be incorporated. Above all else, we need greater consistency among applications, and more extensive and intuitive task-control facilities. There should be a graphical task manager that allows any program to be iconified, "menu-ified," paused, removed (albeit imperfectly without resource tracking), priority-adjusted, etc. And better task-switching facilities (something that would differentiate somehow between full-blown applications and "irrelevant" background tasks) would certainly be a help. Any application should be able to be hidden completely from view, should the user desire. MUI has already accomplished a great deal in this regard; now can we see the same from everything else?
<LI>The AmigaGuide online help system should be expanded and actually used more. There needs to be a focus on improving things for completely new users, especially since we would, after all, like to see some of them join the platform.
<LI>The OS should include a variety of simple applications (along the lines of Windows's "Accessories") to make an Amiga more usable right off the starting line. This is different from bundled software like that found in the erstwhile Magic Pack, which includes full-blown applications, something that can be useful, but a bit daunting for a new user. On the other hand, special package deals could include "AmigaWorks"-style software (and yes, such a suite should exist), while higher-end packages could include equally high-end productivity and creativity software.
<LI>AmigaOS should come with many, many, many datatypes (including, as possibilities, MOD, HTML, etc.). In the Internet age, versatile handling of downloadable data is a must.
<LI>Developers should be encouraged to include datatypes for any custom file formats their programs can create.
<LI>Finally, and in some ways most importantly, we can't let this future AmigaOS blow out of proportion. The core of the OS should still be able to run on a floppy-only system with only a few megabytes of memory. It is possible to make all other features optionally installable in a modular manner; on the simplest level, we already see this in the form of various printer and monitor drivers, and the like. Anything one adds as a system enhancement goes along the same lines. There's no reason to make a future AmigaOS slower; at least, not without the right slow options enabled. Essentially, let's retain all the good qualities of the OS. After all, if I want bloatware, all I have to do is go to the local PC store and pick up a clone. It'll do the job, but oh, what a pain it can be. And besides, what would be unique, and stand out, about the Amiga, if it were "just another PC?"
</UL>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">In Summary</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In conclusion, I'd just like to make a few remarks about the AmigaOS on this A4000T in particular.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Even though some advantages of the current Amiga hardware persist even today, AmigaOS is the bright beacon on this shoreline. This system is a joy to use, in part for its processing power, and in very large part for the operating system.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I could go on and on about specific experiences, but suffice to say I can have numerous applications running in the background, and not notice it in the least. There's just something nice about a machine this incredibly responsive. When I move the mouse, the pointer moves; when I try to move a window, the window moves; if I bring a window to the front, it comes to the front. Or resizes when resized. Or the screens flip on command. This machine is quick in all the right places, and that makes it intuitive. Sure, heavy-duty applications will sap CPU power just like on any other machine, but rarely is my productivity, or creativity, ever hindered when it comes time to change states somehow, such as by switching applications or moving Intuition entities around.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, suffice to say that there's something truly special about this operating system. I don't know how they did it, but it started out a winner, and has grown better ever since. Here's to an even better AmigaOS of the future.</P>
