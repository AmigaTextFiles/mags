@node goss "The latest information........"

        The CD32 went on the market in August '93 and since that day has
sold more than 75,000 units.  It was the first 32bit console ever, and
hopes were extremely high.  It was perceived as the machine that would
either destroy Commodore, or return it to some of it's former glory.  It
was Commodore's first entry into the console market since the days of the
C-16 console.  Although greeted with great enthusiasm by the press,
existing Amiga users were much more sceptical.  After spending many
years trying to convey the Amiga as something more than a games machine,
it was felt that Commodore had gone and produced something of exactly
that nature.  It soon became apparant though that it was more than a
games machine, although Commodore did their best to cover this up, the
CD32 was an A1200 in disguise.
With the use of the @{"Microbotics SX1 Expansion Card" link sx1}, you can turn your
CD32 into an A1200, with the added bonus of a CD drive, and full CD32
game compatability.

By February 94, Gallup were reporting that CD32 software was the highest
selling product on the CD format, easily outselling both Sega Mega CD,
and PC CD ROM.  This is a trend which is set to continue with the
imminent arrival of some eagerly awaited games like TFX and Rise Of The
Robots.

As for existing Amiga owners who want to play CD32 games, well, there is
good and bad news.  A4000 owners will soon be able to buy a CD32 module
for their machine.  It will come with FMV on board, and will allow you
all the benefits of both worlds.  That it, quality applications, and
also very high quality games.  It will undoubtably open up the world of
CD based media to many users, as all ISO960 standard CD's can be used.
It will allow Amiga users to access the already huge catalogue of
utilities etc that exist on CD, something which CD32 users will not be
able to do unless they purchase the SX1 add-on module.  The unit is
expected before the end of spring, and should not cost too much
considering that most of the needed chips are already on the 4000's
motherboard.
As for A1200's, there will not be CD32 compatability unless a third
party developer produces a unit.  Commodore have abandoned all work
concerning the unit due to too high production costs (the unit would
cost more than the CD32 itself), and the inability to have Full Motion
Video on-board.  A matter which Commodore feel is vitally important.

Anyway, that about covers everything on the rumour mill at the moment.
Future editions will deal with the matter of the Vapour-ware CD-64.
Will it ever exist?????  To find out, see the next issue of CD32Bits.

@node game "GAMES!!"

At the press release of the CD32, Commodore announced that there would
be approximately 50 titles available by Christmas 93.  However, the
presently available catalogue has still not reached this figure.  The
failure of the titles to appear seems to be the fault of the development
companies, who were unwilling to commit themselves in light of
Commodores shaky financial situation.  Those companies who did commit
continually missed release dates, and the title that Commodore was using
as the flagship game to promote the machine, @{b}Microcosm@{ub}, only appeared in
the first week of March, nearly five months behind schedule.
The existing titles were mostly re-releases of floppy based games, with
no real enhancements apart from the occassional digital soundtrack.

                        @{"Available Titles" link avail}

Reviewed games will be marked with a number of stars according to how
good they are.

@{fg highlight}*****@{fg text} - Unmissable  **** - Very Good  *** - Good  ** - Fair  * - Tragic

The rating system takes into account graphics, sound, playability and
cost.

One last thing.  The joypad supplied with the CD32 is diabolical.  It is
awful to use, and wherever possible, a normal stick/pad should be used.

@node alie "Alien Breed Special Edition and Qwak"

                @{fg highlight}@{b}Alien Breed / Qwak   Team 17    £25@{fg text}@{ub}

Team 17 will not be releasing any CD32 specific titles until they have a
suitable project to work on.  For the time being, they are concentrating
on re-releasing compilations of their existing catalogue onto CD.  This
means that you get two games for the price of one.  Not bad!!
The prices were originally set at £15 a disk, but for some reason, Team
17 have opted to add another £10 to the price.  This doesn't make the
games particularly expensive, but when you consider that the floppy
version are available as budget releases for about £10 each, things get
put into perspective.

@{b}Alien Breed Special Edition@{ub} is exactly the same as the original Alien
Breed, but with more levels.  The aim of the game is to wander around
a deserted space station, and wipe out everything that moves, with the
eventual task of destroying the station, and all of it's alien
inhabitants.  Along the way, you collect money to buy bigger, and better
weapons, which believe me, you will need.  The game features fantastic
sampled speech, and is by far the better game of the compilation.

@{b}Qwak@{ub}, although quite entertaining initially, is unlikely to hold your
attention for a long period of time.  The game is best on the two player
option, so get another joypad.  The object of the game is to run around
the screen and collect items and keys to allow you access to later
levels.

As with all Team 17 games, the graphics are gorgeous, as are the sounds.
Alien Breed is brilliant, and Qwak is OK, so the disk is still worth
getting despite the price.

Alfred Chicken is one of those cutsy games which everyone likes at first,
but soon gets bored with.  The game is just too slow, and monotonous.
The object of the game is to guide Alfred through various scenarios,
collecting items to reach the level exit.  The graphics are pretty
average, with a control method to match.

This is your standard arcade adventure, where you run around, collecting
diamonds, and solving problems.  The game is quite entertaining, and
will keep you busy for a long while.  The graphics are good, but not
spectacular, which is also the case for the music and sound effects.
For the money, this game is a bit of a bargain.  It is not fantastic by
any means, but is well worth a look.

Well, its another one of those games where you play god, although not a
particularly good one (game that is, not god!!).  Graphics and sound are
pretty standard and the control method is very fiddly.  It could most be

a crap CD sleeve.  What a waste of a CD.  This is definatley not what

sort of stuff that used to be produced for the original Nintendo.

Buy it on pain of death.  If you have the money to waste, send it to me.

D-Generation is a 3D perspective walk around arcade adventure game.  You
are a messenger boy, and supposed to be delivering a parcel to the Boss
of a large company.  On your journey, you come up against many obstacles,
and mental problems to solve.
The game control method leaves little to be desired.  I have always had
problems getting to grips with movement in 3D games, but this took the
prize.  The controls are switchable, but neither of the available
options made any difference, and the save game option always takes you
back to the start of the particular level.
This aside however, if you can get to grips with the controls, the game
has a lot to offer.  Although the graphics and sound are particularly
uninspiring, the gameplay is fantastic, and will keep you coming back
for more.

            @{fg highlight}@{b}Dangerous Streets    Flair/MicroValue    £30@{fg text}@{ub}

This game comes free with the new CD32 packs, but it is available to buy
if you are sad enough.  It is a particularly bad beat-em-up, trying to
run on the back of Streetfighter.  The extrememly large sprite is badly
animated, and the backgrounds are too bright, and clash, often diverting
your eyes from what you are actually doing.  The sound effects are
resonable, but nothing to get excited about.
My suggestion here would be, if you are desperate for a beat-em-up game,
wait for the imminent release of Team 17's Body Blows Galactic.  Both
games cost the same, but only one is remotely worth the money.   Guess!!

I must confess that I really like this game, although it does not have
any save option, or passwords.  This is a major problem, because the
game is huge, and having to restart the game from the begining every
time is a pain.  The game is exactly the same as the floppy version, so
if you have played it, you will know what you are in for.  For those who
don't, it is a scroll along platform game which is similair to The
Bitmap Brother's GODS in many ways.

If you like platform games and lots of shooting, then this is the game
for you.  You will play it to death just to try and get a bit further
than last time.

Pond, the underwater agent, codename ROBOCOD.  Your mission is to travel
around a castle, collecting the evil Dr. Maybes exploding penguins, with
the ultimate goal of preventing him stopping Santa delivering the Xmas
presents.!?!?!?
The game is in the scrolling platform format, and along the way, you can
collect many items which allow you to do more things.  For example, if
you collect angels wings you can fly.  The game is extremely large, but
no different from the original.  The only difference in fact, is the
animation at the start, which is not particularly impressive anyway.
Apparantly there is some FMV in the intro, but I have not managed to
find it.  Perhaps it is a rumour to try and sell the game, which is
ovepriced for such an old title.
All this aside, it is still quite good, and if you havn't played it
before, you can do worse than to get it.

Probably the worst football game in history for the Amiga.  The only
thing that it has going for it are the amazing samples.  Ball control is
all wrong, and it is virtually impossible to score a goal against the
computer.  Not because of the players, but more to the fact that the
goal-keeper is far too good.  You can play any length of game up to 90
mins (YAWN!!), plus you can pick from a wide range of surfaces.
That's about it.  If I was John Barnes, I would be embarassed to have
my name on this.  It's a real dud, and far too expensive!!

Wow, this game looks absolutely amazing.  A graphical adventure where
every image is ray-traced and every sound is perfectly sampled.......
So, where's the problem then.....  Well, what a surprise, it's the
gameplay.  It plays like a turkey.  It is sooooo slow, and totally
impossible to play with the CD32 controller.  Connect a mouse straight
away!!
There does not seem to be any point to this game.  Basically, you start
off in a train carriage, and from there on, you are lost.  For example,
walk into the first maze you come to, and you will regret it.  All the
scenery is exactly the same, and if you don't turn around immediately,
you will end up having to reset the machine, because it will only be
pure luck if you ever get out.  It is also very difficult to pick things
up, and even moreso to find anything in the first place.
The introduction is absolutely awful, and you have to watch it every
time, so it will be doubtful if you play this game often.  Show it to
your friends to impress them, but don't let them play it..

@node libe "Liberation - Captive 2"

                @{fg highlight}@{b}Liberation    Mindscape    £30@{fg text}@{ub}

This game opens with a ten minute long animation, which sets the scene
nicely, although unlike the Microcosm intro, you will not want to watch
it everytime you play the game.  The game itself is very similair in
style to Hired Guns, with exactly the same screen controls as in the
original Captive.  One nice feature which it has above Hired Guns is
that you can look up and down.  The control method is simple, and
easily grasped.
As for the graphics, well they are adequate, but nothing special.
Certainly not to Hired Guns standard.  The sound is perfect, nicely
moody and creates an air of apprehension.

Now, the price.  Mindscape announced that they felt the price was fair
for a title which would only exist on the CD32, and in that they may
have been right.  The only problem with this is of course that it is now
available for the A1200.  The game was evidently too small to be just CD
based, because there were hard disk installable pirate versions
available (without the digital soundtrack of course) within a week of
its release.  The price should really be dropped now that it is not
solely for the CD32, and I am sure that quite a few copies would sell.

There is no difference between the CD and floppy versions of this game,
so the extra money charged for the CD version is unforgivable.  It is
basically a re-make of the classic game PACMAN with different characters
and guns.  The graphics and sound are very basic, but this does not stop
the game from being a lot of fun, albeit a little hard.

                @{fg highlight}@{b}Microcosm       Psygnosis        £45@{fg text}@{ub}

This game is supposedly Commodores flagship game, but has only just
arrived on the scene.........

This is it, the one you have all been waiting for, but is it worth the
attention that it will undoubtably get???
Well, the answer is yes and no.  Yes for the gorgeous graphics,
animation and sound but no for gameplay.  The old problem of good looks,
but nothing under the surface is painfully apparant.

The object of the game is to fly around the bodies internals killing all
the nasties that you encounter....  That is it.... Great Plot!!

The game opens with a very impressive animation, which will be
unrivalled on any other platform.  It sets the scene perfectly, showing
you how it is exactly that you managed to get injected into your poor
victims body.  It lasts a good five minutes, and you will want to watch
it everytime that you run the game, guaranteed.  In fact, if you have
ever got into arguments with PC and console owners over which platform
is the best, show them this.  It will stop them in their tracks.
That is of course, if you don't let them see too much of the game!
because all the graphics in the world cannot make up for a game with no
variation.

When you start the game, you are given the option of going to various
parts of the body such as the skeleton, lungs and brain, and if you
manage to blast your way through a complete section, you meet an extra
large end of level nasty, which is always very difficult to beat.  If
you do manage this, and only the luckiest players will, you are presented
with a different part of the body which has now become accessible.  This
format is continued throughout the game with the ultimate goal of
destroying the enemy

There are various problems with this game, and they all revolve around
the gameplay.  Firstly, the game is just too hard.  You have three
lives, and when you die, you do not start at the point were you left
off, you are taken all the way back to the options screen, which is
extremely annoying, especially as the levels are all extremely long.
Also, there is no real skill involved.  Basically, you just hold down
fire, and move about madly until everything is destoyed.  If you stay in
one place, and try to aim, you will die very quickly.  This erratic
movement is none to comfortable on the silly CD32 joypad, so you are
very much inclined to just give up, and watch the intro again, whilst
nursing your sore thumb!!!

Next, the matter of price....  Although I am sure that a lot of money as
been spent on this game, it is just too expensive.  We are constantly
being told that CD software should be cheaper because of the reduced
problem of playground piracy, and for certain, this game will not be
pirated.  It is just too large.  It's nearest overpriced rival is
Liberation, and that is a full £10 cheaper....

In summarising, if you have the money, definatley get it.  If only for
the sumptuous graphics.  I am sure that when a proper joystick becomes
available for the machine, this game will be given a whole new lease of
life.  If the gameplay had been slightly better, it would have got full
marks, however 4 stars is the most that I feel I can give this game,
which is a pity, because the potential is huge.

Let's just hope that Microcosm 2 fixes these niggles....

You play a spherical lump, very similar to the character in Putty.  Here
though, you have the ability to morph into four different forms: gas,
liquid, rubber or solid.  You must make your way through the level,
morphing into whatever state is neccessary to pass an obstacle.  For
example, you can pass through grids by morphing into a liquid, and then
float up a pipe by turning into gas.  The levels are quite easy to
complete, and the graphics and sound are a complement to an overall
entertaining game.

This is an outrageously easy game, that should keep anybody who is totally
innept at race games happy for at least a short while.  For those of you
who do not fall into this category, I would suggest giving this game a
wide berth.  I am sure that Formula One Grand Prix will come out
eventually for the CD32, and that will be much more worthy of your
money.  The game is too frustrating to be an arcade driving game because
of the maniac other drivers steering into you as you go to pass them,
yet far too little skill is involved to win a race for the game to be
classed as a simulator.  I suppose it is somewhere in between the two.
It looks nice, and the sound is OK, but all in all I do not feel that
the game has any real staying power.

This disk contains two games, both of which are quite good.  The first,
Overkill is a take-off of the old classic Defender, whereas the second,
Lunar C is a horizontal shot-em-up in the style of R-Type and more
recently Project X.  Both have good sound and graphics, especially
Overkill.  The same could be said for gameplay.  The price is quite
reasonable, but if you after this type of game you could do no better
than to get CD32 Project-X.

If you liked the floppy version of Pinball Fantasies, you should like
this, because it is exactly the same.  The tables are enhanced to 256
colours, and there is a digital soundtrack.  The in game music is still
the same as the original, which is a bit of a dissapointment, because it
is bloody annoying, but you can always turn it off.  The control method
is great, much better than the original keyboard controls in my opinion,
but if you have a keyboard connected to your CD32, you can use it in the
same way as the original, plus, the original's typed in cheats also work.

The game is very good and highly enjoyable, but far too expensive.  It
should have been no more then £20, because it is getting quite old now.
Had 21st Century included Pinall Dreams on the disk, it would have been
a sure-fire hit.  The only other niggle is that the high-score save uses
up a lot of space on the flash-rom, which could be a problem if you have
a lot of games which save in that way.

@{b}Project-X@{ub} is a horizontal shoot-em-up in the style of R-Type.  The only
difference between the two games, is that Project-X is much, much
better.  It's graphics and sound are top notch, and the gameplay is
excellent.

@{b}F17 Challenge@{ub} is by far the worse of the two games on this disk.  For
gameplay, it is on a par with Nigell Mansell.  The graphics are OK, but
the sounds are abysmal.  Not a good racing game at all.

This compilation is worth buying just for Project-X, which is the best
shoot-em-up available.

In this game, you are the pilot of a helicopter, in a style very

viewed from above, whereas Desert Strike is viewed on an angle.  The
game is no different from the floppy version, but the graphics are still
OK.  The sound effects are especially good, with the radio messages
particularly coming to mind.  There is only one problem with this game,
and that is the difficulty graduation.  Levels 1-3 are easy, but after
that, it gets very difficult, very quickly.

Everyone in the world has seen Sensible Soccer.  It is the best Football
game available at the moment.  Unfortunately, the conversion to CD32 has
done it no favours.  It is a direct conversion, and will work on the
CDTV as well, so obviously there are no great graphics to talk about.
The gorgeous samples from the floppy version have, for some reason, been
either removed, or changed for the worse, and the control method which
has been converted to the CD32 pad is very bad.
All in all, this release is a bit dissapointing.  It is still vastly
superior to the awful John Barnes Football, but is now just sitting
exposed, waiting to be knocked off its pedestal.

Just because the game was produced for charity, it doesn't mean that it
will be any good.  In fact, it is awful.  The game is far too difficult,
due to the crappy control method, and this problem has just be
heightened when the CD32 pad is in use.  Besides all this, the game
gives you no desire to actually try and work at it.  A lot of the tasks
require split second timing, and that is just not possible with the pad.

Super Putty seems the same as the floppy based Silly Putty, but with
more levels.  You play a lump of blue putty, and the object of the game
is to make your way through the levels, absorbing items, morphing into
other shapes, and punching the baddies.  Although it sounds strange, the
game is very absorbing (no pun intended), and will keep you busy for a
long while.  It looks nice, and has really good sound effects.  The only
thing wrong with it is getting to grips with the control method.  For
£15, this is a bargain.

I have not seen the CD32 version of Trivial Pursuit yet, but have been
assured that one does exist.  I would presume that it is the same as the
CDTV version, but with AGA graphics.  If it does not exist, the CDTV
version will work, and it is worth a look anyway.  Unfortunatley, the
game relies on honesty.  It asks the question, then gives the answer,
and asks you if you were right or wrong.  It then adds any wedges that
you may have won.  The questions are posed to you by a really annoying
parrot, which fortunately can be turned off.

This is a graphical adventure that is very much in the style of Elite
with the addition of nice graphics.  It has the occassional ray-traced
scenes, that make you want to get further into the game so that you can
see some more.  The sound is nothing to talk about.
You fly around in space, you sell things, you buy things, you shoot
people, and people (try) to shoot you.  That is basically it.  It's
quite fun though, and definately better than the highly overated

plot.  The game is AGA enhanced with some really bright backgrounds,
which often interfere with your line of view, and it has a really nice

but with no real features that put it above the floppy version.

@node sx1 "Turn your CD32 into an A1200"

Yep, you add it to your CD32 and its an A1200! with a CD ROM drive.  Wow!
But it's not available yet, because Microbotics have sold out.  When it
does arrive though, expect to pay around £140.  Not bad considering you
are left with a totally new machine.
However there is a snag it costs a further £45 for the keyboard and £60
for the disk drive although any existing one will do, providing that it
works with the A1200 (some have been known not to work!). It allows you
to have a printer, increase the ram address space to 8MB and parnet the
unit to another Amiga, with the plus point that the FMV module can still
be used in conjuction with this unit.  This is of course dependant on
whether you have managed to get your hands on the @{"FMV" link fmv} module. I would 
suspect that the unit will considerably increase the size of the CD32 but 
for conformation we will have to wait until release. Originally the SX1 
will only be available from:

@node fmv "Watch Films On Your CD32"

FMV is undoubtably the most exciting thing to hit the home computer
market in years.  MPEG encoding techniques enable 74 minutes of digital
footage and soundtrack to be pressed onto a single CD.

The FMV add-on module for the CD32 was released in the first week of
January 94, but before anyone was aware of the fact, Commodore had
recalled all of the units due to inherent problems.  As far as I know,
they have not been re-released yet, at least, they still are not
available in the shops.  However, I was one of the lucky few who managed
to purchase one before they were withdrawn, and as far as I can see,
there are no major problems with it.
The rumour was that, once installed, the CD32 was unable to read disks,
but this seems unfounded, because mine works perfectly.

The initial release date was delayed, because Phillips had signed a deal
with Paramount, which meant that the first 50 movies released would only
work on the CD-I.  Obviously a market ploy on their part for shifting a
few machines.  Commodore apparantly re-worked the module with CD-I code
included, and CD32Bits can confirm that all of the presently available
CD-I movie titles work perfectly with the FMV module.

Right, the facts.  Installation of the unit could not be simpler.  You
just unscrew the back plate of the CD32, and push the module into the
slot provided, and screw it in.  You can now discard the original back
plate, because you will never need it again.  The unit, when fitted
correctly, sticks out of the back of the  CD32  by about 1cm, but this
is not a problem.  If you connect a mouse, and hold down both buttons,
you will be presented with the boot options screen.  Upon clicking on
Expansion Board Diagnostics, you will be told that the board is present
and working.
Now comes the exciting bit.  Watching your first Video CD.
Unfortunately, there was no CD supplied with the original units, but
hopefully, Commodore will include one when they re-release the unit.  It
is expected to be a compilation music video.  However, if when you
bought your CD32, you received the Dangerous Streets / Wing Commander
disk, there is a small FMV demonstration of the CD32 television advert.
This I suspect will not hold your attention for long though.  Your next
move is to go out and buy your first Video CD.  This has to be Top Gun,
because it is the best title available at the moment.
All you need do then is load the CD in the normal way, and wait.  After
about ten seconds, you are presented with a menu screen.  On all of the
movie's, there are only two choices.  The first being to view the
copyright warning, and the second being the actual film.  On the CD-I,
you can jump to specified parts of the film, which are indexed in the CD
sleeve.  However, this has not been implemented in the Commodore
version.  Selecting PLAY on the contoller starts the film, and then all
you need to do is connect the CD32 to a stereo system, pump up the
volume and sit back.

The film can be fast forwarded by holding down the relevant button, and
a single tap of the button will advance the film 5 minutes.  It can also
be rewound in the same way.  Pressing PAUSE results in a rock steady
frame, which could be easily grabbed with no loss at all.  Once paused,
you can advance the frames one by one, or play the film in slow-motion.
It is not possible however to play the film in slow-motion reverse.
Another button gives a display of where you are in the CD, plus the
sound can be muted, and switched between the first, and second channels.

The picture quality if far better than that of VHS, with the added
advantage of the CD's never suffering loss of quality.  The films are
best watched when the CD32 is connected to a TV, because slight
pixelation is apparant when run through a monitor.

As far as I can see, the FMV Module for the CD32 is the best computer
product that you can get.  It is not overly expensive (£199), and nor
are the CD's (£15).  If you stare hard enough, you can sometimes see the
frames jump, but I would suspect that this is purely down to the CD
encoding.  Rest assured, it will not spoil your viewing.

I would recommend to anyone, that if you have a CD32, you must get the
FMV Module.  It is absolutely amazing!!
