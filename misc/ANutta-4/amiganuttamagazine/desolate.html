Desolute is the latest addition to the ever expanding list of forthcoming games
from Vulcan Software.  Like all future Vulcan games it will be released on CD
only, a release date has not yet been announced.<P>

The game is a platformer similar to the all-time great, Gods.  However, As well
as being all about killing nasties, the game will also have a heavy puzzle
emement. It is also planned for it to contain certain missions that you have to
complete.<P>

Having played an early demo of the game I am quite impressed.  Although the main
character seemed to move a little showly (this may have been changed), the GFX
were very nice and main basis of a good game seemed to be there.<P>

The game will require any Amiga with an 68020, 2Mb Chip RAM and 4Mb Fast RAM. 
A 4x speed CD-ROM will also be required.<P>

Hopefully this will turn out to be a quality game...<P>

More news when I get it.<P>
