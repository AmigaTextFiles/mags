<FONT SIZE="6">I </FONT> brought you news of this good looking beat-em-up back
in July. Well, work on the game has been going along nicely and there should be
a playable demo available in a month or so.<P>

The game is set for an AGA only release, horever, unlike many of the games being
released now it will run on a unexpanded A1200.  The impressive part of this is
that it will keep up a frame rate of 25fps on this.<P>

The graphics play a big part in this game, the author claims to have the game
running with nearly 5000 colours on screen at once.  This is made possible by
some special copper routines that the author has written.  Other graphical
effects include all the fighters being 100% rendered, animated backgrounds,
parallax and even shadow effects the actually shadow the fighters moves.<P>

The game will support four languages (English, Italian, German and French) both
in the manual and in the game.  The game will also contain some excellent music
that changes depending on how the player is doing.<P>

Like I said earlier there will hopefully be a demo available in the beginning of
October.  The full gave will be released around Christmas time on disk only
(Around 8 or so, will of course be HD installable), there may be a CD version to
follow this.  At the moment the authors are distributing the game themselves,
however if there ar any publishers out there who are interesting why not give
them a call.<P>

The author of the game can be contacted at:- <A
