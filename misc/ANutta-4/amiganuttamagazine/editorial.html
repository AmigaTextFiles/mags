Hello,<P>

Welcome to the forth issue of the Amiga Nutta games magazine.<P>

Well I know I said this last issue, but time has got the better of me again and
the the developers/publishers list and the Highscores table are still not
ready.<P>

The big news this issue is the release of TFX to the Amiga public.  Although it
hasn't actaully been released commercial but instead, is bundled free with CU
Amiga Magazine it is still a landmark for many Amiga owners.  Yes thats right
you don't even have to pay for, as long as you buy the CD-ROM version of CU
Amiga the game is yours.  Excellent you make think, well in the eyes of some,
this is not so.<P>

Already there has been a barrage of complaints about the game ranging from the
fact that the 040 version doesn't work at all to picking out small bugs that are
still in the game.  This, IMO is completly pathetic, what right to people have
to moan about something when they got it free?  I mean if you got a free TV
would you moan because the remote didn't work (Assuming, for arguments sake that
it can be controlled via the TV itself) ?  No. So why moan when a FREE game has
a few problems?  Does this further prove the accusations that Amiga owners are a
bucnh of whiners?  Opinions please...<P>

As it goes I quite enjoy the game myself and haven't really had any problems
regarding bugs, maybe I'm just a lucky one.  One thing that does detract from
it however is the lack of documentation, this makes the game quite hard to play
as quite a few keys are missing as well as other information that is required to
play the game to it's full, however, CU Amiga will be publishing further details
in their next issue.  Some very important keys that are missing are: C - Change
Target, Z - Ground missile guiding view, X - Lock target in this view, 0/. -
Flares/Chaffs.  Hope this helps.<P>

On to games news featured this issue.  Some updated screenshots of Olofight and
Pulsator are available, as is an exclusive look at a new game called Blade. 
Also please check out the Most Eagerly Awaited Game survey.  Here you can tell
moe what game you are most looking forward too.  All results will be published
on the webpage/magazine for you to see.<P>

At last!  I have actually received some letters from you lot, see that letters
page for some interesting views.<P>

Anyway, until the next issue....<P>
