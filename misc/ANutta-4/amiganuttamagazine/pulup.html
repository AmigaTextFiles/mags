As I have told you before, Pulsator is an excellent looking shoot-em-up coming
from FullSpeed Developments.  I now have some new screenshots of the game, and
very good they look to.<P>

The game boasts many feature such as over 512 colours on screen at once and 50
frames a second scrolling.  It also boasts a massive weapons system that will
put all the other games to shame.  It isn't decided how many levels there will
be in the game yet, but one thing I can tell you is that each level will
contain lots of technical effects such as parralax scrolling, rain effects, fog
and some excellent light effects.<P>

There will be two versions of Pulsator, one on disk (Which will require a
Hard-Drive) and also a CD-ROM version.  The CD version will contain extras such
as animated movie sequences, extra levels and music played directly from the
CD.<P>

Both versions will be released in January next year with a demo coming soon.<P>
