HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"> <FONT SIZE="6">A</FONT>urora Works may not be a name
that is well known in the Amiga market, however as those of you you have read
previous articles on them will know, they have some big plans for the Amiga.<P>

Despite being around for quite a while they are still yet to release there first
Amiga game, however, this will change soon when their first title Hover Bomber
hits the shops.  This is nice looking game that is similar to the Bomberman
series of games in that your objective is to beat the other player(s) by laying
bombs and blowing them up, however, the game builds upon this with features that
bring it upto date.<P>

Since my last report on the game things have changed quite a bit.  The game will
now, more then likely be GFX Card only.  This is mainly due to the fact that AGA
can't handle running the game in any screenmode higher then 320x240, this
infact has been one of the reasons why the game has missed its intended
Setpember release, too much work on trying to get the AGA version up to scratch.
The authors will probably consider releasing the AGA version as Freeware after
commercial release of the GFX Card version.<P>

Currently they are planning to have the game running in 3 selectable
screenmodes, 8-bit, 16-bit and 24-bit.  You will be able to choose which one
from a preferences screen at the start of the game.  I am told that the 8-bit
version runs fine on an 030 & Zorro III GFX Card.  The preferences screen at the
start will also allow you to alter other game settings such as audio settings
(The game will utilize AHI), network play settings (TCP, Modem etc.) and also
the option to load news maps, sfx etc.<P>

As regards to internet play, it will be possible but only when all players are
on fast connections that are relatively close to each other.  This is because
the game is very fast paced and requires a lot of data to be exchanged.<P>

The game is currently heading for a pre-christmas release on CD-ROM only.<P>

As for Aurora Works other games, well they have a fair few planned but are
reluctant to give any specific details on them.  Zone 99 which was sceduled to
be their first release has now been put back and will be released after the two
strategy games that they have planned.  Details are scarse on these but I'm told
one of them will be some sort of multiplayer space conquest title.  One thing i
can tell you about them is that they will both have internet support which will
not be limited by speed problems like Hover-Bomber is.  Both of these game
will be AGA compatiable.<P>

They also have a game called Betrayed set for a Christmas '98 release.  This
game will be PPC only.<P>

So as I'm sure you can see the line-up from Aurora Works looks very exciting.  I
will try my hardest to get details on the other games they have planned but
until then keep you eyes open for Hover-Bomber.<P>
