Blade is a stunning new game from Alive Mediasoft.  The game itself is a role
playing - Dungeons & Dragons like game.  However, it differs from many other RPG
in that instead of having a set target like collecting pieces of an amulet or
killing and evil monster, in Blade it is all about exploration.<P>

The idea is, you enter some dungeons, find some treasure, find some gold, kill a
few monsters and get experience points.  On the way you can gain spells and just
genreally have a look around.  You can then go back to the surface, buy some better
weapons and armour and go back and explore even further.<P>

You take control of four charactors, of which you choose from a selection
including Dwarfs, Elfs, Wizards and Warriors. The game uses a similar system to 
that of UFO in that each character has a certain number of movements points,
once all these are used up for each charactor it is the end of that turn.  The
computer will then take it's turn, once done, it is back to you.  This is a very
good system that works really well in this game.<P>

The levels in Blade are randomly generated so you will never play the same level
twice, as well as this there is also the option to modify level specifications
such as maze density and difficulty, giving you the chance to virtually create
your own levels.<P>

Going back to the spells that I mentioned earlier.  There is a total of 28
alltogether.  These are only available to the characters that poccess magical
powers (Wizard, Elf and Cleric).  The spells are not given to you though, you
have to go out and find them, the actual powers of them vary from simple healing
to turning monsters into stone and mental waves of energy.  There are also
around 40 potions/scrolls in the game, these are available to all and have many
different effects such as turning the user invisable and creating energy
bolts.<P>

A word must be said about the graphics, although they are quite small they are
very detailed and on an AGA machine are in 256 colours.<P>

The ECS version of the game will run on any Amiga with at least 1Mb of RAM.  As
for the AGA version, this requires an 030 and 4Mb FAST RAM.  Both versions will
install to Hard-drive.<P>

The game is being released on floppy disk and should be available very soon.  I
will be bring you a preview/review and details on how to obtain the game as soon
as I have had more time to look at it.<P>
