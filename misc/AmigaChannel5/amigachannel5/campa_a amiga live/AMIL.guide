 @{b}@{i}@{u}Purpose @{ub}@{ui}@{uu}


  General purpose of this list is to provide the Amiga Community with
  information about every possible @{i}"PROJECT"@{ui} (2) associated with this
  wonderful computer. That way, you (Amiga users) can @{i}contact@{ui} the
  @{i}"PROJECT"@{ui} immediately and :

   - request misc information
   - send thanks/(b|f)lames (i hope not the second)
   - send corrections/additions/suggestions/improvements/comments
   - get informed about various products
   - exchange opinions

  and many more i can't even think of.


  @{b}(2)@{ub} : The word @{i}"PROJECT"@{ui} used here, refers to numbers 1 - 10
        mentioned in introduction, and @{b}DOESN'T@{ub} try to "underestimate"
        anyone of you.  Therefore it has nothing to do with the field
        "Projects :" used in the actual list.

@node "AMIL_Search" "AMIL_Search"

 @{b}@{i}@{u}AMIL_Search @{ub}@{ui}@{uu}


  This is just an experimental search function. It's written in ARexx and
  it's quite slow (try reading the whole file line by line, while searching
  each line and writing to a new file at the same time).

  @{b}Please pay attention to these :@{ub}

  o You don't need anymore to make an AMIL: assign, so AMIL_Search.rexx
    can load AMIL:AMIL.guide and search it.  AMIL_Search.rexx searches
    first into the current directory and if AMIL.guide is not found there,
    then it searches into AMIL:.

    Anyway if you insist on making the assign, here it is how :

     Assign AMIL: @{i}<insert directory of AMIL.guide here>@{ui}

     ex. : @{i}Assign AMIL: DH2:Docs/AMIL@{ui}

  o Either place AMIL_Search.rexx into the Rexx: directory or better
    leave it into the current (or AMIL:) directory.

  o AMIL_Search.rexx creates a file (called AMIL_Search.guide) into
    volume T:, so having T: assigned as RAM:T is a good idea.

  o The following files must exist and be in your path :

    - rx (found in SYS:rexxc)
    - RexxMast (found in SYS:System)
    - Run (found in C:, resident in AmigaOS >= 2.0)

  o The file RexxMast (@{i}SYS:System/RexxMast@{ui}) is executed before
    AMIL_Search.rexx (rx calls it), so you don't have to run it manually.

  o AMIL_Search.rexx can be run from:

    - CLI

       The word to search for can be supplied either as an argument :
        ex.: @{i}AMIL_Search.rexx thomas@{ui}
       will find and display all lines containing "thomas"

       or leave the program itself ask for one :
        ex.: @{i}AMIL_Search.rexx@{ui}
       will display "Please input word to search for :"
       and you can type in the word you want to search for.

    - WorkBench

       A CON: window will be opened and the message
       "Please input word to search for :" will appear.
       Now just type in the word you want to search for.

  o You can press "Return" before entering anything else if you want to
    abandon the search.

  o The search can be aborted anytime by pressing Control+C. Note that the
    file T:AMIL_Search.guide created till then will be deleted.

  o The search being done is @{b}case insensitive@{ub}, so "thomas" is the same
    as "Thomas" which is the same as "ThOmAs".

  o In order to view AMIL_Search.guide you can use :

    - SYS:Utilities/MultiView (default)
    - SYS:Utilities/AmigaGuide
    - an AmigaGuide database viewer of your choice. All you have to
      do is change the line :
         @{i}Viewer = 'SYS:Utilities/MultiView'@{ui}
      to the right one for your viewer. Please use the @{b}full path@{ub}
      otherwise AMIL_Search.rexx won't be able to find it.

  o The file which is created (T:AMIL_Search.guide) is a normal AmigaGuide
    database containing links to the lines of the nodes where the word was
    found and the actual lines themselves.  So clicking on a button/link
    will transfer you to the appropriate node and line of AMIL.guide.
    Then you can press the "@{i}Retrace@{ui}" button and move back to
    AMIL_Search.guide, press another button/link and so on.

  o The Run command is used with Multiview (or AmigaGuide) so you can
    continue your work while the AMIL_Search.guide is being displayed.
    The drawback is that when you finish, you'll have to delete
    T:AMIL_Search.guide manually.


 @{b}NOTE :@{ub} I'm still waiting for an AmigaGuide (+.library) version with a
        search function included (Anyone/Escom/AT hearing me?).

 @{b}NOTE1 :@{ub} When you come into a name containing 3 words, most of the times
         that means that the first word is the firstname and the third
         (last) word is the lastname.

 @{b}NOTE2 :@{ub} The format used is the first example (USA and other) is the
         general one and can be used everywhere. Try it if nothing else
         works.
