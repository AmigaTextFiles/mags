<H1>Licenceware Buyout</H1>
</CENTER> <HR> <p><FONT SIZE="4"> 
Below is a press release I received recently from Phil Wilkinson.<P>

<UL><B>
Five weeks of discussions and negotiations between the two leading UK
Amiga licenceware companies 5th Dimension and F1 has culminted in the
buyout of F1 by Phil Wilkinson of 5th Dimension.<P>

 From the 1st August 1997 F1Licenceware will be officially taken over
by 5DSoftware. The new company will be named F1 Software and based in
Goldthorpe South Yorkshire, the home of 5th Dimension. The exclusive
Amiga ranges produced by each company will for the moment be kept
separate, but means that the F1 Software range will total over 200
programs including classics like the BlackDawn series, Relics of
Deldroneye, Hilt II, and Disk Mag Creator. The Amos Compiler will
also still be available, as well as many new projects still in
development.<P>

At F1 Software we support the Amiga 100% and will continue to do so
for many years. Our American distributor is receiving a lot of customer
interest, proving that the Amiga still as a good user base in the
States. As software distributors ourselves for over three years, we
know the F1 range well and are determined to build on the companies
pass success. <P>

I feel that a whole new chapter in the Amiga`s story is just beginning,
the future as not looked this bright in over two years and I plan to
put F1 Software firmly on the map and keep it there.<P>
