Here we are again with some more exclusive Foundation information.  The game is
looking better by the day with new features being added all the time.  Just look
at the new screenshots on this page for an idea of how good the game is
looking...<P>

The biggest inprovement recently has to be the High-Res graphics.  This is a set of
graphics that are double the size of the normal ones, these will be used in
higher screenmodes (640x400+) to improve the quality and details of the
graphics.  They are only really going to be of use to graphics card owners as
the game is quite slow in High-Res on AGA Amigas, although 040/060 users may be
able to use them at a decent speed.<P>

The programmer is doing his best to make sure this game utilizes graphics cards
to the upmost, although in no way will he be sacrificing the AGA support in it. 
It does look like, however, that ECS support will be dropped.  This is mainly to
do with the fact that it would create a hell of a lot of work to make the game
look good and run well in ECS.  Anyway, it is a ten year old chipset now and the
only way we will move forward is by dropping an obsolete chipset.  And excellent
choice by the programmer in my opinion.<P>

Now the graphics are out of the way, work is rapidly moving forward on the gameplay
front.  The character commands are currently being built on, things like torch
building and follow person are currently being implemented with a lot more due
in the coming month or so.  There are also a lot of special effects being added
such as fire, smoke and even jumping fish!<P>
