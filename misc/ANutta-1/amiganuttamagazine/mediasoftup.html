<H1>MediaSoft's Amiga Magazines Close.</H1>
</CENTER> <HR> <p><FONT SIZE="4"> 
Following on from last weeks good news regarding Mediasoft, I have now received
the below release.  It would seem that Amiga Review and and newly launched Amiga
Gamer are no more, read on...:-
<UL><B>
From the <A HREF="http://www.mediasft.demon.co.uk/">MediaSoft Magazines Web Site</a>.

<P>Sadly, after just one year supporting the Amiga, <A HREF="http://www.mediasft.demon.co.uk/ARMagazine/arindex.html">Amiga Review</a> has had
to close, and all our future developments for the Amiga have been
suspended. Sales were growing for us until we were refused advertising
from the mainstream glossy magazines, closing out a large percentage
of the market, and since then, despite efforts to promote the magazine
elsewhere, due to declining sales, we have decided to close the
magazine.

<P>It was hoped that by splitting Amiga Review into two different
magazines as mentioned recently, we would overcome the `competition
threat' towards the glossies. Our aim was to advertise Gamer and Amiga
Review separately, and as they were aimed at different markets, we
hoped that advertising space would again be accessible to us. Sadly
this did not happen. We investigated newsstand distribution, but after
long consideration, decided this would not be viable. After all,
newsstand magazines are closing rapidly.

<P>All good things come to an end. I find it a great shame that in this
continually declining market, those that do wish to support the Amiga
are `controlled' by the larger companies/magazines within the market.
It is a democratic world, free speech and all that, but when it comes
down to the business world, money is the be all and end all. However,
by closing off those who attempt to support the Amiga, the entire
market will lose out in the long run. But then the large companies
don't care, as they have milked us of our money and walked away to the
next victim.

<P>As a publishing house we are not dead, we are now simply moving to
another market after six months reorganisation time. And I find it
ludicrous that we will still be using Amigas in our production rooms
to publish other material, yet unable to publish for the computer we
are actually using. All the best to Amiga International, and thanks to
all of you, our readers,and the companies who supported us, especially
Vulcan Software's Paul and Lisa, and the rest of you, you know who you
are. David Pettifer, Editor
