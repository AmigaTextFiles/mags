Hello,<P>

Welcome to the first issue of the Amiga Nutta Games Magazine.<P>

Hopefully you will find this issue interesting.  The aim of this magazine is to
bring you the latest Amiga games news.  The print magazines try, but they are
always a month or so behind the latest news.<P>

News this issue includes some info on Championship Manager 2, news on Sadeness
signing OnEscapee, Fubar, Sixth Sense news and much more.<P>

As this is the first issue I don't have any letters and am also a bit short on
cheats.  If you have anything to say about the magazine or have any questions
that gove me a shout and I will put it on the letter page.  Also if you have any
cheats for recent then please do send them to me.<P>
