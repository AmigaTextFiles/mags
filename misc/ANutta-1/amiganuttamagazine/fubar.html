I'm sure many of you will have heard about this game before.  Well the game is
now past the design stage and the coding has finally began.  The game is now
vastly different to the original specifications though, the project has grown
and the game is now beginning to sound like it could be one to look forward
too.  I am now able to bring you exclusive information about the game...<P>

For those of you who do not know FUBAR is an Action/Strategy game similar to
games like North & South, Risk, Civilization.  They are hoping to include the
best bits of all these games.  Basically the player is shown a map of the world
divided into countries, each player owns certain countries at the start.  It is
there job of the player to wipe the other player(s) out and conquer the
world.<P>

When two players meet they go into battle.  Here you will be able to fire a
range of artilery at each other.  Whoever wins, gets that country.  There will
of course be much more to the game, this is just a brief outline.<P>

The game will also come with a Command Centre from which the player will be able
to fully customise the game.  The user will be able to change virtually
anything, be it from creating a new world to actually drawing the graphics
used.<P>

Like I said at the start the game has gone through a big design shake-up.  The
whole game will now be in Hi-Res instead of the Low-Res like initially planned.  It
will also if all goes to plan include AHI, internet support allowing 4 player
games and maybe Power PPC support.  The game currently requires an A1200 with
CD-ROM to run, although this could change.<P>

The authors are currently in negotiation with various publishers and graphics
artists who are interested in helping with the game.  Currently they are
planning for a Christmas '97/Spring '98 release with a demo version hopefully being released
in August.<P>
