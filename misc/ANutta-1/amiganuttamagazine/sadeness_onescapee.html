Sadeness Software have signed up there second Amiga game title, OnEscapee.  Hot
after the news that they will be releasing Foundation, Sadeness revealed this
excellent news.  An interesting note, however, is that they will also be looking
after the release of the PC version that is being written as well.<P>

OnEscapee is an Action/Adventure in the style of Flashback and Another world but
with many additions.  The game is being written buy Hungarian developers
Invictus Team, a group made up of, in total seven people.<P>

The game is at quite a late stage of development now and the game is beginning
to look quite excellent.  The graphics have to be seen to be believed, you
should be able to see some of the quality in the screenshots that can be found
on this page.  The game will include quite a lot of rendered graphics, there are
also many special effects such as light effects, reflections, water effects and
much more.  A word has to be said about the main character which has more then
600 frames of animation!<P>


Of course the music hasn't been forgotten, the game contains
<IMG SRC="images/onescapee3.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" ALT="OnEscapee Screenshot">
digitised music that is played throughout even when playing animations. Talking of animations
there will be loads in the game, just the opening animation itself is nine megs
in size and lasts over 5 minutes, these animations will of course be full
screen (320x256, although the game is played in 320x200).<P>

Another good point about the game is that uses intuition screens which means
that is will, to a degree, support multi-tasking.  They also plan to include
some sort of graphics card support in the final version.<P>

Currently the game requires an AGA Amiga with a 68020, 2MB Chip, 2Mb Fast and a
CD-ROM Drive.  Like I said graphics card users should find support for there
machines in the final version.<P>

Sadeness are looking to release the game in September, there will hopefully be
a playable demo available soon although it will only be available on magazines
with CD-ROM's, this is due to the fact that it is 50Mb in size!<P>
