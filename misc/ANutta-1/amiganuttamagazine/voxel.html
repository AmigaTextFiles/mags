A new voxel engine which looks set to blow previous efforts away has just been
released.  Although it is still in an early form it is already looking quite
excellent.<P>

The engine currently requires an 020 and at the moment an AGA chipset (Although
this is may change as soon a the Cp2 routine for lesser Amigas has been
written).  A word on the Cp2 routines included, there are quite a few included
with the engine, allowing for different speed Amiga, on the lowest detailed
routine the game can reach upto 50fps on an 030 Amiga.<P>

Currently parts of the engine are written in Amos Pro, although the author will
be changing it so it is completly machine code, hopefully this will make the
engine even faster.  The engine runs in TRUECOLOUR even on AGA machines (HAM 8).
Support for graphics cards is planned but can't be done until the Amos Pro parts
are re-coded.<P>

As I said the engine is still quite early in development and the author is
hoping to use it to write a racing game.  Just take a look at the screenshots

around this page to get an idea of how good it is, I do, however, recommend
that you try the demo for yourself as it looks much better when moving.
