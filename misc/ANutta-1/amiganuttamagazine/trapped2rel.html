Trapped 2 is now finished and is due for release in September.<P>

This excellent looking RPG is the follow-up to Trapped, it has however been
improved in many ways.<P>

This game contains some excellent light effects and boasts many other features
such as speels, polygon monsters and much more.<P>

There will hopefully be a new demo version available on Aminet soon<P>
