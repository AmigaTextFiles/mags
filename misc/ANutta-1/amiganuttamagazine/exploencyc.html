<H1>Collins Encyclopedia Galactica.</H1>
</CENTER> <HR> <p><FONT SIZE="4"> 
I meant to bring you this information last week but it unfortunatly it slipped
my mind, anyway it's here now. =)  (Shall I claim an exclusive on it like other
electronic magazines do even though it was in another magazine much earlier,
naaa..(No names mentioned of course) :)<P>

The Collins Encyclopedia Galactica, quite an interesting name, huh?  Well, it is
the official encyclopedia for the Explorer 2260 game for the Amiga written by
Chris Page / Digital Anarchy Software.  It details the Explorer universe giving
info races, planets, ships and weapons as well as other information on the
mining and the military.<P>

When finished the Encyclopedia will be bundled on the CD along with the game
when it's released.  At the moment it is at quite an early stage with new
information being added to it all of the time.  It also contains a diary of the
game, which is also at quite an early stage.  This will show the development of
the game including screenshots of the game and the development tools that are
being used for the game.<P>

Well, I'd guess by now you'll want the URL for this page, well here it is:-<P>
