Yes, thats right, the Sixth Sense Investigations demo has finally been released.
It is on the September issue of CUAmiga CD.<P>

The game which is being published by Epic Martketing is due out very soon on
CD-ROM only.<P>

Since it is currently only available on the CU-CD you'll have to buy this
magazine to try it out.  I can, however, if you want send the demo to you via
EMail or over IRC if you see me.  (Please note: The demo is about 1.8Mb
archived.)<P>
