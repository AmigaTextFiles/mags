<H1>MediaSoft Release New Amiga Magazines.</H1>
</CENTER> <HR> <p><FONT SIZE="4"> 
<P>
Below is a press release that was sent to me, it would seem that MediaSoft is
continuing its support for the Amiga with a new magazine devoted completly to
games.  This can only be good news as the Amiga needs all the publicity it can
get at the moment....

<UL><B>
--MediaSoft Magazines release two new Amiga magazines--<P>

MediaSoft Magazines, publishers of UK based, mail order only Amiga paper
magazine, Amiga Review, have split the magazine into two individual
magazines.<P>

The original Amiga Review has now been halved in price to 1.60 and is being
geared towards only serious aspects of the Amiga market.<P>

Meanwhile, the second magazine, which has been born out of Amiga Review, is
dedicated entirely to the games section of the Amiga market. It is
called Amiga Gamer and is priced at 1.50.<P>

Existing subscribers to the original Amiga Review will receive both
magazines.<P>

This `divorce' has been brought about due to the great demand that exists
for individual games and serious aspect magazines, and shows our
continued commitment to the Amiga market.<P>

More information can be found at the new-look site:<P>
