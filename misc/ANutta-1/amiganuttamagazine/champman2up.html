Following on from my <A HREF="champman2.html">previous news article</a>
regarding Championship Manager 2, I now have some updated information.<P>

The release date of the game has now been put back to Septemeber, this is for
two reasons.  Firstly, it is the start of the football season and is viewed as
being a better time to release the game and secondly so they can update all of
the data in the game to contain all of the summer transfers etc.<P>

Contrary to what I said previously the game will <B>NOT REQUIRE</B> two drives it will
just run quicker if a second one is present.  Currently the game still doesn't
support hard-drives, although the development team are trying to find a way in
which they can support them, they have come round to the thinking that the
support should be there.  Even if they do support hard-drives it is more then
likely that you will need around 2.5Mb RAM to run the game from one.<P>

Also the team are looking into a way of getting the game to run on systems that
do not have 2Mb of contiguous memory.  I'm not sure if by this it may be able to
run on 1Mb systems or it will be able to run on systems with 1Mb FAST and 1Mb
CHIP.  I'd guess the latter.<P>

Regarding the game itself, well, even though it has been cut down to 1
boot-disk, 1 game creation disk and two play disks nothing is missing from the
Amiga version, it will retain all original stats and foriegn data.  They have
been able to do this due to the fact that the PC coding was very messy and the
Amiga version has been coded exclusivly for the Amiga.  Sounds good...<P>

Anything that they are not able to get into this version in time may be released
in an update two/three months after the initial release.<P>

Keep reading for the latest information as I get it....<P>
