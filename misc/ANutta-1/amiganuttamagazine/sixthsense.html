I have just received news that Sixth Sense Investigations will be released by
Epic Marketing in Late August.<P>

The excellent looking graphic adventure which is based on the Monkey Island
series will be available on a CD only format and will cost £29.99.<P>

The game contains AGA 256 colour graphics and full character voice overs.  The
game itself takes place over 3 worlds with 32 locations.<P>

The game will run on any AGA Amiga with 2Mb Chip RAM and a CD-ROM drive.<P>
