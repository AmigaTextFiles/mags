@NODE edit "Editorial Page"
Well, it's nearly the middle of October and the Commodore situation STILL
hasn't been resolved.  Creative Equipment and Commodore UK, the only
remaining warriors on the now lonely battlefield, both seem confident that 
they have won the bidding war for the control of the single best home 
computer ever produced.

As they wait for the almighty Supreme Court of the Bahamas to declare a
victor, the frustration grows amongst the loyal followers of the Amiga.
One by one, Amiga software and hardware producers are scaling back
production and distribution of Amiga products.  Amiga vendors are becoming
more and more scarce.  Tales of making a trek to the local Amiga dealer,
only to find them closed for good, are becoming more common everyday.
Rumors abound that some of those that promised unwavering support for the
Amiga at the beginning of this long battle are now reconsidering their
position or that their position is killing them financially.  

The loyal following are so starved for news and hard facts that they 
swamped AmigaWorld's 1-800 information line and forced them to take
the line down due to the cost.

And still...the wait continues.

The Amiga, who's reputation amongst videographers and producers is highly
regarded, remains in extremely high demand although no new Amigas have
been produced for over six months and the supply is exhausted.  Those that
have Amigas to sell demand top dollar for their stash.  The Video Flyer,
the highly anticipated non-linear editing system for the hugely successful
Video Toaster, is still scheduled to be released this fall despite a lack
of growth potential due to the lack of new machines.

As a game machine, the Amiga has begun to show cracks in the armor.  The
CD남, the machine with so much potential when it was announced in 1993,
has been written off as "dust" by video game magazines in the United
States and the UK.  The AGA chipset, which breathed new life into the
Amiga's graphics and made the CD남 possible, has not been utilized 
anywhere near it's potential.  The games that are being released are tired 
rehashes of the same games from earlier in the year.  

Sound depressing?  It is.  Is there hope?  I'd like to smile and say,
"Sure, there's hope.  There's a rainbow just over the horizon."  I can't
say that with any certainty.  However, there are some signs that things 
may be looking up.  I'm not sure if it's a long term thing, but it is a 
little relief.  

First, both Commodore UK and CEI seem willing to work together no matter
who actually ends up holding the reins of the company.  This should help
avoid any of the situations that were present with the old regime at the
helm, like the CEO not knowing what machines were in demand. 

Second, some really good games are on the slate for the Christmas season. 
Big titles from Electronic Arts and Microprose to name a few.  Titles like
MUTANT LEAGUE HOCKEY, JUNGLE STRIKE, MEGARACE, PGA EUROPEAN TOUR GOLF,
UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN and, finally, TFX.

I've thought long and hard about the future of this newsletter. 
Sometimes, I'd like to just quit and give myself back some free time. 
Then, something clicks in my brain (usually after using a DOS or Windows
based machine) and I get excited about it and hope someone appreciates it 
as much as I enjoy doing it.

So, don't worry, Amiga Entertainment Monthly is NOT going to disappear. 
It might get lean if new titles don't appear as scheduled or continue to
appear as slowly as they have recently, but it WILL continue to appear
every month.

You may have noticed that this issue is a bit late.  I apologize for that.
It's not because of a lack of material.  (This issue is the biggest yet.) 
I had been delaying the release as long as I could to include some new
news about the Commodore situation.  That, and getting some new software 
to be reviewed became difficult because the distributor I get games
from went belly-up, caused the issue to go way past its usual deadline. 
My apologies to the distribution sites and the readers.  More reviews
will appear next issue.  (I got a bunch of new titles in on the day this
issue was released.  The reviews are already being worked on.  Next issue
will not only be full of new reviews, it will also be on time!)

Please remember that all Internet mail for the magazine should be directed 
to the following Internet address: sean.caszatt@f512.n2601.z1.fidonet.org 

I cannot call Delphi to get mail on a regular basis anymore, so addressing
the mail to the FIDONET.ORG address will get the message directly to me.
(Plus, it will receive a faster reply.)

Until next month, have fun with your Amiga!

From:  Dave Matthews - "david.matthews@oaminet.omahug.org"

Sean- Just got Amiga Entertainment Monthly. Good Job. I especially enjoyed 
the honest reviews, though I wish you had more really good games to 
review. One minor improvement would be to have the reviewers name right up 
at the top of the article. I always like to know whose work I am reading. 
Not that guessing isn't fun, with AEM's giant staff of writers! :-)

Well, here's hoping the Amiga lives on. Keep up the good work.

[Sean replies:

Thanks!  I review whatever games I can get ahold of and find the time to
review completely.  There's no real point in me reviewing a game that I
haven't played enough to really know what I'm talking about.  If there's a
game you'd like to see a review of, let me know and I'll do the best I can
to get a review done for it.

Actually, the reviewer's name IS at the top of every _contributed_ review.  
If there's no name, that's because I wrote the review.  We don't exactly
have a "giant" staff, so there's not a lot of contributed stuff anyway.]

@NODE THANKS "Thanks and Kudos!"
Thanks to all the readers that keep reading this newsletter every month.
We seem to be getting quite a following.  Keep supporting the Amiga and
we'll do the same!

We had planned a contest in this issue that'll be a sort of "thank you" to 
all the readers.  However, that is going to have to be delayed at least
another issue until we can come up with a good idea for a contest that's
not too easy but enjoyable and fair.  Have any ideas?  Send them to us!

@NODE GAME1 "UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN Review"
UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN
System: CD남

My first contact with this title was (gasp!) on the PC.  I received a
playable demo of a game called X-COM: UFO DEFENSE and, after playing it
once, tossed it aside.  

At the time, there was little known about an Amiga version of the game.  I
believe a contributing factor to the confusion is the fact that the US
version is called X-COM: UFO DEFENSE and the European version is called
UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN.  Why the change?  I don't know.  (Remember how the US
version of ANOTHER WORLD was called OUT OF THIS WORLD?)  The Amiga version
is from Microprose's European division, so the Amiga version will always
be called UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN.

Either way, I wasn't too excited about this game based on my experience
with the demo.  I began hearing a lot about how addictive this game was
from PC owners.  Amiga owners were beginning to get restless; they wanted
the Amiga version.  I still didn't understand why.

An Amiga version still is M.I.A., but a CD남 version appeared and I
figured I'd better take a fresh look at this game to see what all the
buzzing was about.  Boy, have I been missing out!  The demo of the PC
version was just a small part of the game and didn't really give me any
idea on the scope of the game.

The whole premise of the game is that you are in control of X-Com, an
anti-alien defense squad that is funded by the world's governments.  It is
your duty to protect the Earth from an alarming number of alien craft that
have been buzzing the planet.  

Beginning with the barest essentials, you must defeat alien ships by
knocking them out of the sky, racing to their crash sites and stealing
technology and weapons from the surviving aliens to use against them later.
All the while, you must keep in close contact with the governments of the 
world to keep your funding in order.

The whole game is really a series of sub-games.  The scenario of building 
the X-Com bases has elements of DUNE II and the alien crash site sequences
are similar to SABRE TEAM.  (These similarites are not at all a problem,
they actually help lend some familiarity to the game.)

It's hard to explain why, but the game is extremely addicting.  Maybe it's
the fact that you're given so much to do.  The game blends a giant heap of
strategy with just enough action to keep it from ever getting boring.

The game includes a tutorial on how the basic functions work, so you'll
get the hang of things right away.  (Although, I didn't use the
tutorial...I just jumped right in, started playing and never got lost.) 

My only gripes about the game are minor.  First, the disc access times are
relatively slow.  It takes a little while to move from one scenario to the
other.   Second, the packaging is kind of cheap.  Even though the game
comes in a big box, the CD is in a paper envelope rather than a jewel box
(Microprose's long box packaging, like those for IMPOSSIBLE MISSION 2025
and GUNSHIP 2000 would have been much nicer.)

It's games like this (especially now, with game releases of any
significance for the Amiga and CD남 becoming fewer and farther between) 
that make me happy I own a CD남.  It's fun, intelligent and challenging: 
everything a good game should be.  Highly recommended.

@NODE GAME4 "Deluxe Galaga Review by Marc Buhmann"
DELUXE GALAGA
SYSTEM: Amiga 500 or higher
HARD DRIVE INSTALLABLE: Yes
MEMORY REQUIRED: 1 MB or higher
CONTROLLER: Joystick
Workbench 1.3/2.x/3.x compatible

"Deluxe Galaga" a vertical space shoot 'em up arcade game. This is the
newest version, updated from version 2.2 on September 21, 1994. Actually,
I think this is the newest verison since I haven't seen anything newer
out.

I'm not one who gets into shoot 'em up arcade games. Mainly for the fact
that I suck at them. But when I saw this game getting great comments from
fellow Amiga users on Fidonet, I decided I'd try and find to see what all
the hype was about. Well, after over a month of searching, I found this
version (as stated above, newest version me thinks =-). I quickly
downloaded (about 5 minutes with 14,400 bps) it and decompressed it.

After scanning through the documentation that came with it, I was ready
to load up the game and play it. The first thing that pops up (or should
unless someone has set the prefs already in which case you may want to
delete them if you're not using their standard computer setup) is a
preference screen. You get to choose the screen mode (NTSC or PAL), the
processor (68000, 68020, 68030/40), and when the game should save the
high score (during the game or on exit of the game). After you set it up
to your liking, it saves that way in a prefs file. When you have it set
up the way you want, just click on the 'OK' button and the game loads up.

The game is the standard shoot the bad guys and advance in levels. As
stated before, I usually don't get into this type of game. But I was
impressed with this game. Unlike a lot of other shoot 'em up games,
"Deluxe Galaga" does not put all its efforts into the graphics and leave
the play ability alone to suck. The graphics are good but could be
better, but all this is explained in the docs. Basically he wanted a game
which put all efforts to the play ability and not so much on graphics (am
I repeating myself???). Anyways the evil ships come at you and you shoot
them and advance levels. One thing I've never seen in a PD/SHAREWARE game
like this is the ability to buy add-ons to your ship. After every forth
level you can buy new things for your ship which is kind of nice. That's
about it for the review of the game, now lets get on with the LIKES and
DISLIKES.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

One thing that I like is you can play the game either from floppy or from
the hard drive... your choice. If you want to make the disk bootable so
the game starts when you put the disk in the drive, there are
instructions on how to do this in the docs. I know of one version out
there that has this ability already put in. I guess the uploader wanted
to go that extra step to help his fellow Amiga users =-). Unfortunately,
that version is in a .DMS compression and it is located on Delphi.

Another thing I like is how easy it is to configure. All of it is from
the main screen when you first start the game. There are a few things
(like adding random Protracker modules to the game) where you have to
actually do some work, but nothing the most computer illiterate user
couldn't figure out.

The documentation is well written and makes everything in the game clear.
I wish most docs were like this.

One of the final LIKES about this game is that you can use the CD남
controller (if you have one). Though it doesn't use any of the buttons
except the red fire button, it does make the play ability a little
better.

Lastly, the thing I like most is... THE GAME MAY GO AGA!!! The author
hasn't decided yet, but is considering it.

Really, the only dislike I have about the game is the fact that the sound 
reminds me of the sound capability in the "ancient" IBM's. Now this may be 
a cruel thing to say, but that was the first impression I recieved. 
Other players of this game my feel totally different.


PLEAS

Edgar W. Vigdal has released this game (Deluxe Galaga v2.3) as SHAREWARE.
When you download the game, you get the full blown working version (at
least, that's what it appears). The only request is you send him $10US
dollars, 5 England pounds, or 150 NOK (what the...?).

ABOUT REVIEWER

   I hope I didn't offend anyone by saying something. I don't think I did,
   but it's always a possibility. I have written a few reviews for Amiga
   Report ("Beneath A Steel Sky" and the PD game "Colonial Conquest") and
   more recently Amiga Entertainment Monthly (the complete walkthru for "The
   Labyrinth of Time" (with the help of Bruce Buhmann)).

   This review is Copyright  1994 by Marc Buhmann (me!). You are free to
   pass this around all you want as long as no change is made to the file,
   especially the copyrights to Edgar M. Vigdal for "Deluxe Galaga" and me
   for this review.

@NODE GAME5 "Quick Capsule Reviews"
This is a quick glance at some games I had a chance to play for a bit, but
didn't get a chance to do a complete review of:

OVERKILL/LUNAR C - (CD남)
Oh, wow!  Two games on one disk.  That might sound good, but once you
realize that instead of getting one good CD-ROM based game with excellent
sound and graphics you're getting two semi-mediocre Amiga ports with iffy
graphics and somewhat sloppy game play.  OVERKILL is a DEFENDER clone with
some nice graphic touches, but it lacks the "feel" of the original game. 
LUNAR C is a way-too-easy shooter game that might be good for kids, but
real gamers will want to avoid.

OVERALL RATING: 65%      Video Mode: PAL


WILD CUP SOCCER - (Amiga)
Continuing the Brutal Sports series of games that began with BRUTAL
FOOTBALL, WILD CUP SOCCER attempts to make soccer brutal.  It works to a
point but is nowhere near as fun or exciting to play as the original game.
Soccer with over-the-top creatures with violent tendencies just didn't 
work for me.  The rather odd control response didn't help the playability 
factor much.  It's fun, but, if you don't have BRUTAL FOOTBALL, you'd be 
better off hunting that title down.  (Plus, BRUTAL FOOTBALL is available
in ECS, AGA and CD32 versions while WILD CUP is available only in an ECS
version.) 

OVERALL RATING: 70%      Video Mode: PAL

SIMON THE SORCERER - (CD남)
The CD남 version of the extremely popular graphic adventure uses the
CD남's CD audio capability to bring the game to life.  Using actors' 
voices, the characters in SIMON become much more engaging.  Unfortunately, 
the game hasn't changed much at all and a few new animations and a new 
soundtrack will probably not attract those that have already enjoyed the 
game on the Amiga.  As a game itself, SIMON CD남 is great fun.  It's just
too bad that it can't be enjoyed as a totally new experience for everyone.

@NODE RATINGS "The Ratings - Explained"

We judge the games we review in four different categories:

Graphics
--------
This is pretty self explanatory.  The higher the percentile, the better
the graphics are.

Sound
-----
Another no-brainer.  The higher the percentile, the better the sound. 
Although, this also relates to it's coordination with the gameplay.  If 
the sound seems inappropriate for the type of game it is, the game will
score lower in the Sound category even if the sounds are technically well
done.

Gameplay
--------
The gameplay refers to the addictive quality of the game as well as the
way the game plays.  If you find your self sitting and watching rather
than interacting with the game, the game will score lower than one that
actually involves you.

Control
-------
This refers to how easy the game is to control given the control method
specified by the manufacturer. A game requiring a special controller 
that is not specified or not included will be penalized.  A game that 
comes with a special controller or one that recommends that, say, an 
Amiga mouse might work better than the standard CD남 controller will 
not be penalized.  A game that is programmed to use a mouse when a
joystick would be much more appropriate would also be penalized.  Of
course, a game that's just plain hard to control with any control method
will also feel the sting of the rating.

@NODE LGTM "Lame Game of the Month"
This is an award presented to one game per month for being the worst of
that month's issue.  It's mainly to warn you, the consumer, about a game
that's REALLY bad.

If we have an issue with no really bad games...there'll be no award given.
A game that wins this award DESERVES to win!

CREATIVE EQUIPMENT INTERNATIONAL VERY CONFIDENT IT'S THE ONE!

Here's the latest Knight-Ridder report on the Commodore situation:

Commodore bidder so confident it's advertising for new 
engineers, managers
   By Dan Stets
   Knight-Ridder Newspapers
   After weeks of delay, the fight for Commodore International
Ltd. finally may be entering the last round.
   One of two contenders is feeling so confident that it is
advertising Thursday morning for engineers, managers and
accountants to restart the computer company's operations in the
West Chester, Pa., area.
   The two main adversaries -- one American, the other British --
are to meet separately in New York over the next few days with
one of the liquidators appointed by the Bahamian Supreme Court
to dispose of the assets of the once-mighty, small-computer
maker.
   The liquidator, Franklyn Wilson, will be reviewing the final
buyout proposals from Creative Equipment International of Miami
and a management team from Commodore's subsidiary in the United
Kingdom.
   The contest pits Commodore's largest distributor in North
America, CEI, against the managers of one of Commodore's most
successful subsidiaries.
   Commodore filed for bankruptcy in the Bahamas in early May
and the court there appointed two accountants as liquidators,
the Bahamian equivalent of a bankruptcy trustee under U.S. law.
   The company was incorporated in Bahamas but had its North
American headquarters in West Chester.
   Wilson, the lead liquidator, had hoped to sell Commodore's
assets and technology by the end of August, but it now looks
like a final decision will not come until next month.
   ``We think that it could happen within the next three
weeks,'' said CEI president Alex Amor, who today (Thursday)
starts advertising for employees in the West Chester area.
   ``We'd like to have resumes on hand and we'd like a good
pool of talent,'' said Amor. CEI would like to hire back as
many of Commodore's former computer engineers as possible, he
noted.
   If CEI's proposal is successful, Amor said he will be hiring
about 90 people, including about 70 engineers, over the next
nine months. He also has begun looking for a new engineering
and research center in West Chester or Norristown, Pa.
   An employment ad appears in Thursday's editions of The
Inquirer. ``Commodore Experience Helpful,'' the ad emphasizes.
   ``That should give you some idea where we think we are with
the trustees,'' said Amor. The CEI proposal is ``the best offer
on the table,'' he added.
   CEI would like to have an engineering and research staff of
90 people, Amor said. At its peak, Commodore had 78 engineers,
he said.
   While the employment ads indicate CEI is bristling with
confidence, the United Kingdom team is not fazed.
   ``I would hope they would pass the resumes on to us when we
win the bid,'' said Colin Proudfoot, a managing director of
Commodore U.K. and a leader of the buyout effort.
   Both buyout teams say they are committed to developing and
expanding the technology of Commodore's Amiga computer, which
among other things can be used as a low-cost videotape editor.
   Both teams said they have scheduled meetings at the
Manhattan offices of Fulbright and Jaworski, the liquidators'
counsel, the British on Friday and the Americans on Monday.
   Wilson has been in the Philippines this week trying to
resolve what has become one of the stickiest issues in the
liquidation.
   Commodore had its manufacturing operations there and still
has an inventory of components there. Both bidders had hoped to
acquire the inventory, which includes computer processors.
   For reasons which he has not yet explained publicly, Wilson
has been having trouble including those assets in the final
package for purchase. Neither the U.K. team nor CEI intend to
resume manufacturing in the Philippines.
   The U.K. team handed its final proposal to the liquidator
last week. It was supposed to be valid for only 10 days, but
Proudfoot Wednesday dismissed the notion of any expiration
date.
   ``The fact of the matter is that we are in correspondence
with the liquidator and it is a fluid situation,'' he said.
   ``Does it mean we are going to withdraw if the 10 days
expires? No, it doesn't because we want the business,'' he
said.

INTERVIEW WITH DAVID PLEASANCE OF C= UK

 Area: Amiga International (ECHO)

        Here's the latest off of Compuserve (note tagline....I didn't edit
this one!!):

Here is an article that will appear in the next issue of the ICPUG Journal
in England, to be published in about two weeks.  The JOURNAL is one of the
best technical journals for Commodore products still being published.


COMMODORE - THE FUTURE

INTERVIEW WITH DAVID PLEASANCE

John and Janet Bickerstaff

Tuesday 6th September 1994. We arranged to meet David Pleasance, Joint
Managing-Director of Commodore, at the European Computer Trade Show in
London. This is what he had to tell us.

Management Buy-Out
We are, in fact, about two weeks behind what our schedule was. We had
planned to announce the successful management buy-out of the assets of
Commodore International and Commodore Electronics at the ECTS. The reason
why we are two weeks late is that two weeks ago Colin Proudfoot and I were
in New York with Coopers & Lybrand (who are acting for us), one of our
investment people, the Liquidator and the Liquidator's lawyers, for a
meeting which took approximately five hours, which you can take as a
positive sign that the Liquidator is taking us very seriously. The purpose
of that meeting was two fold. One was to
establish finally what can and cannot be delivered in terms of what is
available for sale. The second reason for the meeting was to determine
exactly how our bid was to be structured to make it easier for the lawyers.
To say that the situation with Commodore and all the subsidiary companies is
complex is a major understatement. All the companies have
cross-shareholdings and trading arrangements.

The net result is that we were told (and it came as a major surprise to us)
that the Liquidator could not, as previously promised, deliver to us all of
the component parts inventory which is currently in the Phillipines, and
that formed a very major part of our business plan to enable us to bring
products to market for Christmas.

That meant that we had to come back to the UK, get in touch with all the
component suppliers from around the world, find out whether they would
supply us, find out how much it would cost to get our product put to the
front of the queue, how much for air freight, work out how many machines we
can built and the profit on them. In other words we had to draw up a
completely new business plan in order to satisfy our investors, and that we
have done in just two weeks, but we are two weeks behind on what we had
originally planned.

Coopers & Lybrand have now drafted an unconditional draft agreement, which
is what the lawyers asked for, and that effectively says, this is our offer,
this is what we want and, subject to you delivering this to us, we will pay
you. That will be delivered to the Liquidator today. We have put on the bid
a validity period of ten working days to come back with an answer.

However, life was never meant to be simple, the US courts have yet to decide
whether they wish to intervene. They have the option of letting the Bahamas
do it, doing it in conjunction with the Bahamas, or taking it themselves,
which is very unlikely. We should know within ten working days from today
whether we have got this or not. We are very confident about it because we
know that the other players are doing, but nothing is certain in life.

Research and Development
The seventeen Commodore engineers currently residing in Norristown, US, are
extremely happy to work with us, and we have budgeted to immediately take
them back up to sixty/sixty-five people. The way that we will run the R & D
Centre is that there will be a team of about fifteen people, who will be
looking after current technology. Their role will be to support existing
products and to manufacture derivatives, and new products from our present
architecture. The remainder will be working on new technology, and that is
exclusively RISC. We have canned that AAA project completely, and the reason
is that although the chips are virtually finished, there is no operating
system, and this would take eighteen months to bring to the market. In
addition, we will be bringing Chris Ludwig over to the UK permanently, and
he will head up a team of about twenty people whose sole job in life will be
to support developers. This will be a major step forward to strengthen our
relationship with the developers. Within six months we will have development
systems for the RISC product and those systems will go selectively to the
development community. I intend to loan them the machines until they have
developed products and, when they start to sell these products, I expect
them to pay me for the machines. For the first time we will have developers
able to work on new software before the hardware hits the market.

Current Technology
We intend to establish sub-license agreements with companies who make third
party products and who have ancillary products who are not in competition
with us. We have established a good relationship with NewTek and Scala, and
we intend to allow them to use our hardware in whatever manner they see fit
to sell more systems. We will be prepared to work very closely with anybody
who wants to develop third party peripherals that will help us to sell
Amigas, and that again is a complete change of attitude from Commodore in
the past.

Marketing
We expect to have products coming to market around the middle to end of
November and, because of the component part situation, we will have less
CD32s and A1200s that we wanted to meet demand, but we will major more on
A4000s. This gives us the opportunity in the UK to support the independent
dealers and we will feed them the bulk of the products and likewise in
European countries.

New Products - Amiga card for the PC
There will be no new products this side of Christmas for obvious reasons. As
soon after Christmas as we can, we will have the CD drive for the A1200 and
the expansion box for the CD32, and then within a few months we will have
new products using existing technology. One of those products is almost
certainly going to be an Amiga on a PC card. This will probably be a
sub-license deal with another manufacturer. This could be a very substantial
business because everybody who has a PC wants to turn it into a multimedia
machine and an Amiga on a card could be a very cost-effective solution.

The Way Forward
We will be having a forum in the UK, and one in the US, very quickly after
we have got the company and that forum will basically be to talk with
everybody saying, look we have got a blank piece of paper, we can go in any
direction you like, tell us what you want so that we can all swim in the
same direction. This forum will be for anyone interested in the future of
the Amiga.

Change of Name
The company name will almost certainly be Amiga International and we will
not be using the name Commodore anywhere. The new company will be based at
Maidenhead. The products will be manufactured in the UK, possibly by ICL,
who can provide warranty and support.

Shows
We are doing the Motor Show. There is part of the Motor Show called Future
World and that is at the NEC at Birmingham from the 18th to the 30th
October. What they have got is the Motor Show, the Ideal Home Exhibition,
and Future World on at the same time. One ticket gets you into all three
shows. Future World contains a ride which was manufactured for BMW for last
year's Motor Show in Frankfurt. This ride
takes you through a series of shop windows with live people working in them
(a bit like the Epcot Centre). It carries two thousand people an hour and 
we have a stand right where everybody gets off this ride. 800,000 to a 
million visitors are expected at this show.

@NODE RUM1 "AmigaWorld's 1-800 #"

This is not a rumor...this is true.  AmigaWorld and TechMedia had to
disconnect the 1-800 information line that they had provided to keep
everyone informed of the situation regarding Commodore.  It was swamped
with calls and it cost them a LOT of money.  Here is one of many messages
that delivered the news to those on the FIDONET Amiga International echo:

 From: NYLE F. LANDAS                        Date: 09-10-94 07:17
   To: ALL                                   Msg#: 9907
Subj.: Commodore Update.......
 Area: Amiga International (ECHO)

Hi all,
    I just called the 1-800 number, which will be shut down soon since
too many people have been calling.  Many people called everyday, and
the bill has reached the tens of thousands of dollars.  So, the number
will now be direct dial only 1-603-924-2195.

There is still no official announcement - blame the lawyers. 
Commodore U.K. still appears to have the lead bid, and David Pleasance
made an unconditional bid this week in an attempt to speed things up. 
David, also believes as mentioned before that no  official
announcement will be made until the 15TH of September.

I'm sick of waiting too folks, but let's just pray that they get the
technology in enough time for the Christmas Season.  I'm also
starting to hate the 15TH of each month with a passion.

I hope this helps quell more rumors... As it is from a pretty good
source the AmigaWorld Hotline - And editor in chief Dan Sullivan.

Kudos to all hard core Amiga fans and to the rest ... well you know...

@NODE RUM2 "New Games For the Amiga"


@ENDNODE

@NODE RUM3 "More C= Scuttlebutt"
From a very good source, we received word that Commodore UK and CEI have
each resubmitted bigger and better bids for the remains of Commodore. 
Rumor has it that Commodore's former chief of operations in Germany has
pledged his help to Alex Amor and the CEI group.  He would assist CEI in
their European affairs if CEI wins the bid.

Both CEI and Commodore UK have met with the Bahamian Supreme Court and the
trustees as recently as the last week of September.

Another rumor indicates that a third bidder will soon enter the fray. 
Officials from Commodore Germany and Australia have teamed up and will
offer a bid of their own.  How this is related to the CEI/C= Germany
team-up, if at all, is unknown.  

These are rumors after all...
