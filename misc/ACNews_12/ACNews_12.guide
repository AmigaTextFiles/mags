@{FG Shine}Welcome to AmiChannel News@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 12th issue of AmiChannel News.

First of all, I would like to apologize for releaseing the "June" issue in July.
You can blame my nephew because he was born on Friday June, 25th, so I could not
access my beloved Amiga to edit the issue you are reading now.

Before  speaking  about  anything  else,  please let me tell you that this issue
means the first anniversary of the magazine you are reading now. It has not been
easy  to  reach the 12th issue. Although I recieved the help of some friends for
the first two issues, the rest ones have been produced by myself.

But  this magazine is really the result of your support. So far, I have recieved
letters  from  four  readers.  Every  word  of  these  letters  has given me the
necessary  strenght  to  continue to release it. So, thanks Donald, Uno, johnnie
and from Berk Iybar from Turkey. And I apologize because I have not yet answered
your emails. I am currently working hard at my job so I have not time to reply.

And,  it  has  not been easy because things have been hard in the past. Remember
that  this magazine was born after the infamous World of Amiga 98, the date when
the  Amiga  classic  was  stated  as  "dead" by Amiga Inc. We have seen how some
magazines  have  closed  (CU-Amiga),  some  developers have left the Amiga scene
(Vulcan, A.C.T.), ... but the future is really bright.

A  new  magazine (Amigactive) is about to be born from the CU-Amiga's ashes, the
AmigaOS  3.5 is about to be released (by the way, it is going to be premiered in
Australia, congratulations aussies)... And there is a responsible for this: last
name Collas, first name Jim.

I  do  not  know this "guy" personally, but every open letter he writes makes me
feel  as  he  is  just  like another Amigan, he never used an Amiuga though. And
sometimes I think is more "Amigan" than Petro himself ;-)

In these letters, Jim uses repeatedly a word: REVOLUTION. We do not know yet the
exact  features  of the AmigaNG, netiher the first Amiga products to be released
(except  the  OS 3.5 and the dev boxes), but he is planning to manage Amiga (the
company)  in  a  revolutionary way. This "Amiga Advisory Council", whose members
are  going to be some of the Amiga leaders, is a really good idea. For the first
time, the community is going to be a part active of the company.

The  next  issue  of AmiChannel News is going to be released some days after the
World  of  Amiga  99,  to be held in London 24-25 July. I hope to bring you with
all the details of the show.

Let  me  to  finish  this editorial revealing a big secret. A friend of mine who
read  once  one  of  the  AmiChannel  News  editorials,  asked  me  once why the
editorials  had such a weird title (I do not remember what title was). Well, the
explanation  is  very  simple. Forrest Gump used to say that the life was like a
chocolate  box.  I  do not agree with him. Martin Tapper (from the TV show Dream
On)  used  to relate his own experiences with old TV series. In a similar way, I
use songs. As easy as that. Every life could be explained using titles of songs.
In  this  issue, I have used the last hit of Backstreet Boys (BTW, I do not like
their music :-p).

Remember to visit the @{B}SAUG@{UB} website, which is located in:

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.

FIRST WIPEOUT 2097 AMIGA SCREENSHOTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Digital Images proudly presents the current state of the Wipeout2097 project for
AMIGA  together  with  the  very  first screenshots out of the current prototype
version  for  AMIGA.  But  finally  the biggest hurdles have been taken, and the
project  makes  really  good progress. Two developers are intensively working on
WO2097 for AMIGA.

Right  now  we  have compiled the game for PPC/WarpUp, and we have an executable
which  actually  works.  The  tracks can be played and most effects seem to work
fine. The game actually runs in fullscreen mode and also in window mode. We will
also  add  the possibility to resize the window on the fly, which will certainly
be an exciting feature, which again will show: 'Only AMIGA makes it possible!'.

Nevertheless  there  is  still  a long way ahead of us. We will need time to add
optimizations  to the engine. Right now the whole AMIGA version is based on 100%
C,  which  of  course makes the game running slower as if it was optimized using
assembler parts. We will make sure to get out as much as possible from the AMIGA
hardware.

Right now there is no sound (neither CD sound nor FX), and the animation playing
stuff  (MPEG)  is  in development. Additionally a lot of finetuning and analysis
have to be done to ensure that the graphics quality gets as good as possible.

These  screenshots  were  taken off the current prototype version of Wipeout2097
for  AMIGA.  These  are  the  very first screenshots of WO2097 AMIGA ever shown.
Enjoy :)

You   can   find  full  size  screenshots  able  to  find  more  screenshots  in
www.digital-images.demon.co.uk

IBROWSE2: CLOSE TO BE RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some  days  before  Easter  someone  announced that the release of iBrowse 2 was
imminent.  However,  this  wasn't entirely true, iBrowse 2 is currently still in
beta test.

This  process  will take some time because IBrowse 2 adds a lot of new features:
full  JavaScript  1.2  implementation,  HTML  4  support, improved GUI, improved
preferences,  the cache system has been rewritten (it's now even faster and even
easier  to  use),  the  table  parser has been rewritten (it's now lots faster),
spoofing has been implemented, there's external news client support, an improved
URL  completer,  multiple  browsers can be opened in one window (controlled by a
nifty tab system) plus, of course, plug-in support, and more, much more.

Testing  is  going  well and iBrowse 2 is very, very close to being released. In
the meantime, here's a screenshot of one of the new preferences panels. This new
panel implements something that thousands of users asked for, the ability to set
how  iBrowse  displays  individual  websites.  For  example,  you can enable GIF
animations for some sites and disable them for others.

MICROCODE TO DEVELOP FUSIONPPC AND PCXPPC IF...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microcode  Solutions have announced that they will develop FusionPPC and PCxPPC,
if  they  get 500 pre-paid orders for each product. The retail price for the PPC
upgrade  modules  is $199.95 for each module. If you pre-pay for either product,
you  will  be  charge  only $149.95. If there are not enough pre-paid orders for
either product, they will not finish that product!

Both  emulations  will  offer  no  more  restriction over the 68K versions, only
enhancements.

PCx PPC

The  PPC  module for PCx will feature full Pentium II processor level emulation,
using dual CPU support. The 68K CPU will handle the video, audio, and other I/O,
while the PPC CPU will be used strictly for x86 emulation/translation.

Initial list of features for PCx PPC:

   * Support for Windows 3.1/95/98
   * Faster all round emulation
   * Improved and enhanced video support, all VESA modes supported
   * Improved Audio

FUSION PPC

Fusion  PPC will bring PowerMac emulation to the Amiga, so you can run Macintosh
native  PowerPC  applications  on your Amiga. There will be an option to use the
68K  CPU to execute 68K instructions instead of allowing the PowerMac to emulate
the 68K CPU (like normal), resulting in dual processor usage.

Initial list of features for Fusion PPC:

   * Support for all current PPC supporting Mac OS versions.
   *  Will  require/support compatible PPC Mac ROM image on release, with future
   support for iMac system CD (ROM-less) targeted.
   *  Use of the 68K CPU to handle 68K CPU instructions, instead of allowing the
   MAC to emulate the 68K CPU.
   * Compatible with current PPC Mac software.

ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM RANDOMIZE, INC.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Randomize, Inc. - Genesis DVD Survey, AVI/QT ready and Monitor Solutions -
Toronto, Canada - June 2, 1999

DVD Survey

Any one that has been watching what we have been doing in terms of Amiga Systems
will  have noted that we are attempting to allow as many popular "PC" devices to
be used on the Amiga as possible.

DVD  compatibility  has  been  discussed  a  number  of  times with in the Amiga
communicty  but  at  this  time  we  are  unaware  of  any one that has made DVD
compatibility  areality.  With  the  prices  of  DVD  readers  comming down very
quickly, we feel that this issue needs to readdressed.

As we understand it, DVD compatibility has been not happened for a few reasons:

   * Insufficient CPU speed to decode DVD
   * Insufficient Graphics card speed to display DVD content
   * Insufficient bandwidth in the CD and HD interfaces

Looking  over  these concerns we have recognised that our Genesis Odyssey PPC II
with  a BVision graphics card is the first Amiga to likely meed the requirements
for DVD by providing:

   * PPC processor for decoding
   * The BVisions direct CPU access
   * builtin fast SCSI for CDs and HDs

There  is  no doubt that the Odyssey PPC II is not the only system to have these
requirements but that Amiga systems with a Cyberstorm PPC (and possiblity MKIII)
with a CyberVision (or possibly a PicassoIV on a true ZorroIII bus) would likely
meet the requirements.

With this in mind, we intend to work with the various and related Amiga Software
and Hardware manufactures to bring DVD to the Amiga.

But,  the  question arises, do Amiga users really want DVD compatibility and are
they  willing  to  pay for it? If you'd like to be involved in this process then
please       fill       out       our       DVD      Survey      located      at
www.randomize.com/genesis/gennews.html.

Genesis Systems Now Come AVI & QuickTime Ready using MooVID

As  we  continue  to  develope  the  Genesis  Series  into  the Amiga multimedia
computer,  we  are  pleased  to announce that all Genesis systems will ship with
MooVID  AVI  and QuickTime player pre-installed. After having tested a number of
players,  we  determined  that  MooVID provides the best compatibility, quality,
flexibilty and interface.

ViewSonic Monitors Now Offered to Complete Your System

We are also pleased to announce that we now offer Viewsonic monitors to complete
your  system purchase from us. Due to an agreement with a US distributor, we are
now able to be quite competive in monitor sales to our US customers.

Improved Shipping Service to US Customers Via UPS

In order to serve our US customers better, we have reached an agreement with UPS
to provide discounted pricing on 2nd Day shipping services.

3DFX ADD ON FOR PICASSOIV - NAME THE BABY!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scheduled  for  the  3rd  to 4th quarter 1999 is the Village Tronic's new add on
board for the PicassoIV modular graphics-board.

The  board  will  bring  3Dfx technology to ZorroIII Amigas like A3k, A4k, A1200
with  z3  board  in conjunction with an additional PicassoIV. It will give never
seen 3d functionality to the Amiga-classic range of computer systems.

With  the optional PabloIV module you will be able to bring your 3D-applications
to your 25" Television and/or tape your 3D-Scenes to your videorecorder.

From  the  technical  side of view the board will be able to bring up to 960x720
pixels  in  resolution  with  8  MB of texture/pixel ram. Programmers will get a
native GLIDE® API and later an additional Warp3D driver for the Haage&Partner 3d
API-system.

Chipset:

JIM COLLAS CLARIFIES SOME FACTS ABOUT TED WAITT'S INTERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

June 8, 1999
Dear Amigans,

Ted  Waitt  was recently interviewed by Guardian Online about Gateway's plans in
general.  There was also a question specifically about Gateway's plans for Amiga
that Ted answered as follows: "we've had a group of people working on leveraging
the  Amiga  assets into an appliance strategy for us. How well that works out, I
don't  know:  it  will be interesting to see. There are some great assets there.
It's  definitely  not  a  computer business." This comment has obviously spurred
many  responses  from  the  Amiga  community.  I want to assure people that this
doesn't  reflect  a  shift  in our Amiga plans. We have not changed our plans to
release  a  next  generation Amiga multimedia computer. I have described the new
multimedia  computer  and  how it integrates into a full "information appliance"
environment  in  my  May  letter to the community posted on our web site. Please
read the May letter, as it will help you understand Amiga's product strategy.

Ted's  comments refer to Gateway's product plans for using the Amiga technology.
Gateway's  main  interest  in  the  next  generation Amiga technology is for the
emerging  information  appliance  market.  Gateway's focus on Internet connected
information appliances is justifiable given the extremely high potential of this
market  and  it's  threat  to  the PC industry. Prominent Industry analysts have
called  information  appliances  "the  next  Internet wave" and "one of the most
exciting  opportunities  of  the  new  millennium."  By  the  year  2002,  it is
forecasted  that  information  appliance shipments will surpass PC shipments and
there will be more information appliances connected to the Internet than PCs. If
I  were CEO of Gateway, this would also be one of my primary areas of focus. But
I am not CEO of Gateway. I am CEO of Amiga and I don't want to confuse Gateway's
plans  with  Amiga's. There is a significant overlap in our plans but there is a
difference  in  focus.  I  have  been  empowered  by  Ted  to  drive Amiga as an
independent  company  with  it's  own  strategy and plans. This will eliminate a
major  challenge  that  has  held  Amiga  back  for many years. The challenge of
getting  the proper attention and priority from large corporate parent companies
which are focusing on their core business.

Regarding  Amiga's strategy, I have mentioned many times that Amiga will use the
immense  emerging  information  appliance  market to build momentum for our next
generation  architecture.  This is why we have come up with an architecture that
integrates  the  power  of  multimedia  computing  into  a  full  home computing
environment  that  includes  information  appliances.  This  is  a revolutionary
architecture  and  computing  environment for the future that combines power and
simplicity.  It  is  a  powerful  plan that gives Amiga a great chance of rising
again as a significant force in the industry. On my trip to Germany and the U.K.
last  month,  I presented details of the architecture and plans to a small group
of  prominent  people  in  the Amiga community. I did this confidentially to get
some  feedback  and validation on our plans. Once people understood exactly what
we  were doing, the feedback was very positive and people were excited about the
revolutionary new architecture. Personally, I am extremely excited about sharing
details  of  the new Amiga architecture with the community as a whole but we are
still in a very sensitive stage relative to competition and technology partners.
I  know this is frustrating to the community since you have waited so long for a
next  generation  product.  We  will  continue  to  share as much information as
possible when it is appropriate.

I  hope  this  letter  clarifies  Ted's  statements  on  Gateway's  use of Amiga
technology. I will continue communicating as much as possible. You can expect to
see  my  June letter to the community in a few weeks. I promise you that 1999 is
going  to  be  a great year for Amiga and the Amiga community. Keep the momentum
going as we come back for the future.

Sincerely,
Jim Collas
President and CEO, Amiga

SHAREWARE AUTHORS WANTED FOR WOA'99
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

AmigaSoc  the  UK  usergroup UGN representative body will be hosting a Shareware
stall at World of Amiga 1999.

Basically  there are a number of reason why we are running the shareware scheme,
and none of them is to make money!

We  have been involved with the Amiga for a long time now, and we recognise that
a  large  part  of  the software available for the Amiga is, or has been at some
time, shareware.

Software  is  what  keeps  a  computer  alive and with the decreasing commercial
market  we  realise  that  shareware  is becoming more and more important on the
Amiga.

Here  is  a  list of Shareware authors who have confirmed their participation so
far and have agreed for us to sell their products for them.

Vapourware Products
Virus Checker II Alex van Niel
F1GP-ED Oliver Roberts

PhotoAlbum
CyberShow

Helmut Hoffmann

Webplug
Mapplug

Esteve Boix
MagiC64 Michael Kramer

ManiacBall
Diamond Caves I
Diamond Caves II

Peter Elzner
Star Trek: A Call To Arms Frank Mathieson
MysticView Timm S Mueller


We  are  also in negotiation with Jean-Francois Fabre and his famous Amiga games
patches/hard drive installers.

A large number of Amigans use shareware programs but have never registered them.
Many want to, but to be honest, find it is too much hassle with conversion rates
to change money into foreign currencies, etc.

We  want  to  support  the Amiga and you in any way we can. We would like to see
shareware  authors  being rewarded for the hard work they have done, and we hope
our scheme will encourage you to keep supporting the Amiga.

We  don't hope to gain anything out of this free service A small fee of maybe 50
pence  extra  will  be  charged  to customers, to cover our costs of duplicating
disks, stand hire, etc),

As an organisation we hope to keep the Amiga going, with your help we can.

The World of Amiga attracts thousands of Amigans annually. Don't miss out.

If you would like to help us to help you, then please contact Chris Livermore of
AmigaSoc at chrisl@uk.amigasoc.org for further details.

MILLENIUM SURPRISE FROM DIGITAL IMAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Sometimes,  when  you're  not  drunk,  or caught in the mundane banality of your
everyday  life  you  start  to think about the world around you, don't you mate?
During  these  times, a dark shadow tends to hang over a lot of things you think
about, doesn't it old friend?

A  person of your intelligence often realizes how sick and perverted society can
be in these twilight days. You see that everytime you switch on the telly, let's
face it!

   *  What  if  there  was  a  revolution  waiting  to  appear on the surface of
   post-modern society?
   * What if you could be a part of that revolution?
   * Would you have the guts to pay the price?
   * When the going gets rough, are you tough enough to get going?

Summer 2000 you shall have the opportunity to prove yourself.
Think  once,  think  real  hard,  and  then  decide  to  become  a  part of this
revolution.

An  action  packed  game  awaits  those brave enough to match their tactical and
logistical abilities against those of the evil Big Brother watching.

Based  on  a  film  script  (hopefully  soon  to  be  produced  by a smart media
professional)

Technical Features:
   * 3D isometric game engine (with a few juicy extras)
   * Detailed Manga/Anime graphics
   * Broadcast quality fmv cut scenes
   * highly competitive single player mode due to extremely sophisticated AI
   * Multiplayer over LAN and Internet
   * Target Platforms:
      - multiple - PC & NGAmiga (definitely),
      - others (yet to be decided)

A website dedicated to the project will be up and running by mid July.

Hiya,

The  Free  Amiga Organisation, which originally began with just aMozillaX on its
books, is trying to recruit existing freeware projects, and programmers to begin
new projects onto our books.

If  you are working on a freeware project, consider joining us, we will design a
web   presence   for   you,   we   will   give  you  space  on  our  web  server
(www.freeamiga.org), we will give you publicity, we will write documentation and
catalogs  for  your program in upto 14 languages, we will set up other resources
if you require them, such as mailing lists, anonymous ftp, CVS repositories etc.
We  have  skilled  graphics  artists  whose work has appeared in the major Amiga
magazines,  who can work on gfx for your program, and programmers who will offer
assistance  and  help  in  C,  C++,  and  Blitz.  We are working on a searchable
database   of  Beta  Testers  to  help  you  find  beta-testers  who  meet  your
requirements exactly.

If  this  appeals to you, please contact me, and I will send you the information
and will welcome you gladly into the project.

Two  such projects which have joined the Free Amiga Organisation are Dry Ice and
CD2Mpexer.

Contact: sales@blittersoft.com

June  10th,  1999  - Blittersoft have announced today that as a special offer we
will  be giving Fusion and PCx 68K emulation packages away free to all customers

Fusion  and  PCx  PPC  modules  will be released *IF* it can be assured that 500
pre-orders for each module are received.

offer.

This  offer  is  strictly  limited  to those pledging to pre-order until the 500
minimum  quantity  is  reached  and  *only*  to those who do not already own the
programs.

OLAF BARTHEL GIVES SOME DETAILS ABOUT THE OS3.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The  development  of  the  eargely  awaited AMigaOS 3.5 is coming to an end. The
first  beta  versions  are  being shipping now and it is going to be released os
August,  21st  (at  the  same  date  that  "The  Phantom  Menace" is going to be
premiered in Spain).

Olaf  Barthel  has been recently very communicative in the german newsgroups. He
has given some details about the 3.5 icon.library: icons will always contain 1-2
icon  bitmaps for compatibility reasons, the more colorful icon images are saved
in an extended format which packs much better than NewIcons.

Olaf  Barthel  has  pointed  out  that the new 3.5 icon system will be backwards
compatibly  all  the  way down to kickstart 1.0. He has said this wasn't done to
satisfy A1000 users, but rather because he didn't want to modify the icon format
in  a  way  to  make  it  unreadable by all Amigas who don't have 3.5 installed,
especially as that way the OS 3.5 (install) CD would look pretty empty.

The  "browser"  is  only  supposed for reading the online documentation, and the
version of Miami will probably only support one network connection at a time.

Olaf  Barthel  has said the quality "rules" imposed by Amiga for AmigaOS 3.5 are
not meant to restrict the success of the product, but that they rather originate
from  the  fact  that  Amiga  Inc. are unsure and they feel "fear" as far as the
results  of  the  OS  3.5 project are concerned. The cause for these feelings is
that  they  don't know the market and the Amiga community. Only Jim Collas seems
to have understood what problems they caused themselves with this behaviour.

Olaf Barthel has said one idea when chosing the features for OS 3.5 was the need
for  reducing patches, by integrating functionality that is expected nowadays on
the operating system.

Olaf  has said Amiga's goals with the update are to keep a low profile and don't
do anything which might cost too much. The decision that RTG/RTA was not allowed
to  be  part of the update also came from Amiga. However, Olaf has said that one
should  not  under-estimate  the package. He has said that it contains more than
the website or the few previews made believe.

T-ZER0: A SHOOT-EM-UP TO END ALL THE SHOOT-EM-UPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After  the  big success of their past games Capital Punishment, Myst, Quake, and
more  recently  Napalm,  clickBOOM  is  about  to release their next big seller:
T-zer0.

T-zer0,  previously  known  as Trauma Zero, is a shoot'em up much in the line of
classics  as  R-Type or SWIV. It has been in development for two years now by an
italian group and hopefully it is nearly finished.

T-zer0  is  played  in  either  Story  mode, Arcade mode or Battle mode with you
taking  control  of one of the three crafts (there is also some hidden ones). It
will have a simultaneous two player mode and contains a massive array of weapons
(over   50   available   such   as  Guns,  Laser,  Side-Shot,  Plasma,  Missile,
Homing-Missile, etc) and it is full of enemies such as big end of level bosses.

It  will  feature  a real time animated background with 256 colours at 25 Hz and
have real time translucency effects like the fire of a missile or the background
around  an  explosion.  It  will  include  a  lot  of  speech, awesome animation
sequences  (including intro and between levels), incredible graphics and tons of
sprites on screen along with 1/4 pixel scrolling.

The current list of specifications are:

   * 50fps 1/4 pixel scroll;
   * insane number of sprites;
   * adjustable transparencies;
   * power-up galore;
   * few 100Mb of intro+between level movies;
   * free, full level editor, used to create the game, included on the CD;
   * two choices of powerups (high-tech, classic arcade);
   * a lot of speech;
   * two choices of cd music high-tech (techno/trance), arcade (pop);
   * 1/2 players;
   * several endings;
   * hidden aircraft/levels;

T-zer0  will  require  an  Amiga AGA, 8 Mb RAM, 030, 45 Mb HD and CD. Sadly, the
game  is going to be AGA only, so it will not support GFX cards. This is because
that  only  the  direct  use  of  the AGA chips allows a huge number of sprites,
backgrounds, explosions and everything else.

It is planned that the game will be released at the end of July, just in time to
be  premiered  at  the  World  of  Amiga  show  in London. It is expected that a
playable demo is going to be released soon.

@node not25 "OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY BY JIM COLLAS : JUNE/JULY 1999"

OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY BY JIM COLLAS : JUNE/JULY 1999
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Amigans,

I  apologize  for posting my June (now June/July) letter so late. I was ready to
post it last week, but decided to scrap it and re-write it this past weekend for
several  reasons. One reason is feedback I received from the Amiga community. To
better understand the desires of the Amiga community, I have been following many
of  the Amiga public forums (in addition to reading the thousands of emails sent
to  me).  I  have  posted in a few of the forums when I felt it was important to
clarify  information  relative  to  Amiga's  plans. In the "comp.sys.amiga.misc"
forum I posted a message requesting feedback on our strategy and plans. The post
is  in  the thread titled "Collas and LeFaivre - thanks for talking". I received
many  good  insights  and  suggestions in response to my post, but while reading
these  responses one thing was clear: I haven't given the Amiga community enough
information  to clearly understand our plans. The community still doesn't have a
clear  understanding  of  our  product  plans,  and  what  we  mean  by the term
"operating  environment".  This  is obviously not the fault of the community but
mine  in not communicating enough information. This is why I decided to scrap my
original letter and address this issue.

In  the past several months, I have attempted to disclose as much as possible to
the  Amiga community without disclosing too much to our competition or violating
confidentiality  agreements  with  our technology partners. I don't think I have
been effective at striking the right balance in this regard, so I just initiated
an  activity  to  disclose  more of our plans. We are putting together a five to
seven  page  product  strategy and technology brief that will be released to the
Amiga community within the next week. This brief will help you better understand
our  overall  plans  by  giving  you  more  details  on  our new Amiga Operating
Environment (OE) and Multimedia Convergence Computer (MCC). The technology brief
will  also  talk about new and exciting Amiga technology. I will talk a bit more
about some of this technology later in this letter.

This  brief will also disclose some of our 3rd party technology choices. We have
spent  the  last  four  months  evaluating  technology  and  defining  the  next
generation  hardware  architecture and software structure. We have now finalized
the  architecture  and  structure.  We  have  also  finalized  all  of our major
technology  and  partner  choices.  A significant amount of effort and resources
went into the evaluation of 3rd party technology - you may be surprised at a few
of  the  decisions  but  I am confident you will agree that they are the correct
choices.

Before you read the brief you should understand that we are still not at liberty
to  disclose  all of the details of our plans. I don't want to disclose too much
to  potential  competitors  and we are under confidentiality agreements with our
key  technology partners. Within those boundaries we will disclose as much as we
can. The difficult part about not being able to disclose everything is that some
decisions  don't  seem  to make sense unless you have all of the information. We
have no choice but to work around this for now.

As  background information for the technology brief I would also like to discuss
the concept of revolutionary products and our strategy for implementing the next
generation Amiga.

REVOLUTIONARY PRODUCTS:

rev·o·lu·tion·ary  ("re-v&-'lü-sh&-"ner-E):  adjective;  1  c:  constituting  or
bringing  about  a  major  or fundamental change in the way of thinking about or
visualizing something: a change of paradigm <a revolutionary new product>

The  original  Amiga  was revolutionary because it drove a fundamental change in
computer  graphics  performance,  capabilities,  and  overall  value. It allowed
people  to  do  things  that couldn't be done with other systems at the time. It
moved  computers  a  big  step into the future by fundamentally changing the way
people viewed and used computers. The next generation Amiga must do the same but
in the context of the present computer industry. Faster CPUs and faster graphics
alone  will  not drive a revolutionary new computer platform. They are important
but  not  revolutionary.  Revolutionary  thinking  requires us to let go of past
preferences  and  envision a future that doesn't currently exist. It requires us
to  develop technology and functions that enable this future vision. This is the
spirit  of  revolutionary  innovation.  The  same spirit that drove the original
Amiga development team.

The  problem  is  that  revolutionary  paradigm shifts are difficult to envision
before  they  occur.  Let me give you an example. When I was in college, I had a
job  as  a  software  developer  programming  video  games  for  the Atari 2600,
Commodore64,  and  Apple  II  (This was before the first Amiga came out). At the
current  time,  all  video  games were programmed in assembly language. This was
great  at  the  time  because  it  gave  you complete control of the hardware. I
couldn't imagine programming a game in a high-level language such as C++ because
it  would  be  so  incredible  inefficient.  It  just seemed like an unrealistic
proposition.  Well,  the  world  changed.  You  can't  manage  the complexity or
extravagance  of  today's  games in assembly. You need sophisticated tools and a
high-level  language  like C++. This was a revolutionary paradigm shift that was
hard to envision years before it happened.

Keep  this  section  in  mind  as  you  read  the  technology brief that will be
released.  It  is  not  enough  to  bring out an incremental product. It must be
revolutionary  in  order for all of us to succeed. You must think in a different
dimension  to  understand  the revolutionary nature of the next generation Amiga
environment.  The technology brief will help you understand this future vision -
I look forward to getting your continuing feedback on our directions.

PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:

Our  strategy for implementing the new Amiga is to integrate the best technology
in  the  industry  into  a  new, efficient, exciting, and revolutionary computer
platform  focused  on the future. It is important to understand this strategy so
that  you  can  better  understand  some of our decisions. The computer industry
today  is  much  different  than  it  was when the first Amiga was designed. The
initial  Amiga  was  designed when the computer industry was at its infancy. The
computer  industry  has now matured and the dynamics have changed significantly.
The industry is replete with companies developing and supplying great technology
and  components.  As  an  example,  there  are many excellent companies offering
sophisticated  high-performance  3D  graphics chips. All of these companies have
one  goal  in  mind:  to  develop  and ship the best 3D graphics solution. These
graphics  companies  have  many  world-class  engineers.  Trust me, I know these
companies  well. To think that we could design our own 3D graphics chip that was
better  is  not  reasonable.  This  is  why all leading computer companies (IBM,
Compaq,  Gateway,  Apple, et al.) now depend on 3rd party graphics companies. It
was  clear  to  them  that  internal  resources  couldn't compete with companies
specialized in this area. This is the normal cycle of a maturing industry and is
the  reason why we can't think in the past when creating a revolutionary product
for the future.

Does this mean that the Amiga won't be unique or lead in performance? Absolutely
not!  Firstly,  you  shouldn't  define  performance  by exclusively using narrow
benchmarks of today's industry. We need to focus on addressing the next computer
revolution  rather  than  competing  with  the  last one. Secondly, an extremely
efficient  architecture  will make the most out of commonly used components like
3D  graphics  chips. We can get remarkably impressive performance by coupling an
industry  leading  PCI/AGP graphics chip to the extremely efficient architecture
of  the  new  Amiga.  On  the  CPU  side  we have selected a CPU that will bring
exciting new capabilities to the Amiga. I can't disclose what instruction set it
uses  at  this  time  because of confidentiality agreements. I can tell you that
it's  very  exciting  and  NOT  an  x86  architecture  processor. Our plan is to
disclose  the  CPU  in several weeks at the World of Amiga and AmiWest shows. At
this time I hope to disclose all of our technology choices and partners.

In  order to pull this great technology together and develop our next-generation
platform, we are also developing our own technology in key strategic areas. This
technology  will  allow  us  to  make  the  product  unique, integrate 3rd party
technology and create the final revolutionary product. For example:

A TEASER:

The  technology  brief will also include the description of new Amiga technology
that  I  think  is  particularly  exciting.  It is an object-oriented technology
developed  by  Amiga  called  the AmigaObjectTM. The AmigaObjectTM is a powerful
software  structure  that  enables  easy  integration of technology, distributed
computing,   high-speed   network   transactions,   and   communication  between
applications.  They  are  also powerful software building blocks that will allow
people to build impressive applications quickly. AmigaObjectsTM are portable and
transferable  across platforms allowing AmigaObjectsTM to proliferate throughout
the  network,  the Internet and the world. Do I have your attention yet? This is
just  one  piece  of  the  new  Amiga  operating environment. It is this type of
technology that will allow us to build a revolutionary computer platform. We can
discuss  this  technology because we have now filed patent disclosures giving us
some protection against competitors. More on this in the technology brief.

IN SUMMARY:

The upcoming technology brief will be released early next week. While it will of
necessity  be  at  a  fairly high level, it will still be the most comprehensive
description  to date of the new Amiga product and operating environment. I think
it  will  go  a  long  way  in helping you understand Amiga's future and the new
products.  I  am  very excited about releasing this information and getting your
response.  After  you  read  it, I think you will agree that Amiga and the Amiga
community has a chance of driving the next computer revolution.

Sincerely,

Jim Collas
President, Amiga

  will  be  moving out of the Gateway building into a separate building in order
  to accommodate the expansion in Amiga's staff.

New Management Staff:

  1.  We  hired  Dave  Curtis  as  director of object technology and transaction
  services.  Dave  will  be  responsible for developing our transactional object
  technology.  Dave  was  one of the original architects of CORBA and has worked
  for   Inprise   (Borland),  the  Object  Management  Group  (OMG),  and  other
  organizations  focused  on  object  oriented technology. Dave's expertise will
  help  us  implement  transactional  object  technology  in the Amiga Operating
  Environment.
  2.  We  hired  Dr.  Jim  Miller  as  director  of user experience. Jim will be
  responsible  for  all  user interface design and software development. Jim has
  worked  in  the  human  interaction  groups  of both Hewlett Packard and Apple
  Computers.  Jim  is  highly  respected  and  well  known  in  the national and
  international user interaction (UI) community.

Major Development Programs:

  1.  O/S  3.5  - The target final release is August 21st at the Amiga Downunder
  show  in  Australia. We are talking to Amiga hardware development companies to
  qualify hardware products targeted at the O/S 3.5 release. We plan to come out
  with a recommended hardware configuration and list of qualified Amiga hardware
  products for the O/S 3.5 release.
  2.  AmigaSoftTM  Operating  Environment  (OE)  -  We  are  developing our next
  generation  operating  environment including operating system, user interface,
  and  some  revolutionary  software structures to be disclosed at a later date.
  Target  beta version is late 3Q99 with final in late 4Q99. We are also looking
  at  the  possibility  of  porting  this  new  AmigaSoftTM  OE  to  the O/S 3.5
  recommended  hardware  configurations. If we can accomplish this it will allow
  people to run the new OE on specific Amiga configurations with PowerPC boards.
  3.  AmigaSoftTM  development  system - This is planned in late 3Q99 along with
  the beta release of the new AmigaSoftTM Operating Environment.
  4. Amiga Multimedia Convergence Computer (MCC):
      - We have finalized our industrial design and created foam models.
      -  The next mechanical design step is hard models. These will be available
      for WoA and AmiWest.
      - We have initiated final schematics of the system board design.

Shows and Community Activities:

  1.  We  held  a  telephone conference with the Amiga press to bring them up to
  speed on our plans.
  2.  We  received  all  of  the  nominations  for  Amiga Advisory Council (AAC)
  members.  We  will  be notifying the top nominated members for approval in the
  next week. First AAC conference call should occur within two weeks.
  3.  We  initiated  multiple  Amiga  hosted  forums accessible though our Amiga
  website.
  4.  We  will sponsor and participate in the 1999 London World of Amiga show in
  late July.
  5. We are also planning to support the AmiWest show in late July.
  6. We are planning for the Cologne and Las Vegas shows in November.

Photogenics 4

Finally, after four years of hard work the new version of the well-known graphic
manipulation software Photogenics is available.

Photogenics  is a graphics/art package. It allows you to create stunning images,
either  from  scratch  or  by  modifying  existing  images. It can be used for a
multitude   of   purposes,  from  simple  file  conversion,  to  advanced  photo
manipulation and re-touching. It also offers extremely realistic and easy to use
media such as pencils, chalk and watercolours to create stunning masterpieces in
minutes.

Photogenics  is  based on innovation. At its core, it works on images unlike any
other  product. Nothing you draw is permanent, it can be rubbed out as easily as
it  was  drawn, and tweaked to perfection. This freedom allows you to experiment
to a level never before seen.

Photogenics Feature List:

   * Unparalleled levels of creativity from being able to modify (in real time!)
   the  colour,  transparency,  image  processing mode, and even the position of
   what you have drawn.

   * Realistic Media tools such as Airbrush, Chalk, Pencil, Sponge, Watercolour,
   Smudge and Smear.

   * Designed to look and feel good using just a standard mouse.

   *  Paint-on  Image  Processing  allows  the  user  to apply effects simply by
   drawing  with  any of the media tools. Being able to just airbrush everything
   on  (and off!) allows instant touch ups without the need for tedious masking.
   Paint       modes       available       include       AddColour,       Adjust
   (Brightness/Contrast/Red/Green/Blue),   Bas  Relief,  BiColour,  Blur,  Burn,
   BurnThru,  Clone, ColourToGrey, Convolve, Darken, DifferenceRGB, DisplaceMap,
   Dodge,  EdgeDetect,  Emboss,  FlipX,  FlipY,  Hardlight,  Lighten,  Min, Max,
   MotionBlur, Multiply, Negative, Overlay, Paint, PanBlur, Pixelize, Posterize,
   RadialBlur,  Roll,  RubPaint,  RubThru,  Screen,  Fire,  Solarize, Softlight,
   SubtractColour, and Tint.

   *  Exclusive  Paint Layer technology allows mistakes to be rubbed out without
   having  to  redo  the  good  parts, simply by fading out with the right mouse
   button.

   * Unlimited number of easy to use layers allow fast image composition.

   *  Stunning  Paint-On  Pyrotechnics such as lensflares, fire, and explosions.
   Combine  with  the  smear tool to produce supernovas, waves of fire, and even
   sunsets and waterfalls.

   * Innovative clutter free user interface (font sensitive and user scaleable).
   GUI components can be docked/undocked, and positioned whereever you please.

   *  Fully  Multi-threaded  -  you'll  never  be  kept waiting as Photogenics 4
   responds instantly to your requests even while operations are in progress.

   * Advanced yet still easy to use Alpha channel support. Use any open image as
   a  mask,  or  simply paint one straight on to the image. Updates to the Alpha
   channel such as brush strokes are reflected on the main image in real time.

   *  24bit Alpha channels. Only Photogenics lets you use colour Alpha channels,
   which  enable  you  to  independently  mask  each  of  the red green and blue
   channels.  Paint  on the Alpha with red, and this lets the red component show
   through,  paint  on  with  yellow,  and  both  the red and green channels are
   updated.  Painting  with  shades  of  grey  produce masking as normal. Create
   awesome  effects  by  loading  in  a 24bit Alpha channel and using it to mask
   image-processing effects.

   *  Symmetry  Tool  -  combine  with  any of the Media tools to create amazing
   images in seconds.

   * Text Tool - finally you can just click where you want the text, and type it
   straight  onto  any  paint  layer. Text remains fully editable until image is
   Fixed into the underlying image.

   *  Multiple Views - allows you to have as many views of an image as you like,
   each with its own magnification.

   *  Impressive colour selection facilities, with five colour choosers, RGB and
   HSV  sliders,  and support for 256 colour swatches. You can also pick colours
   from Images, with changes updating in real time.

   *  Extensive  file  format  support. Current list includes loading and saving
   IFF-ILBM,  IFF-DEEP,  JPEG, Targa, BMP, PNG, with more to follow. Photogenics
   also supports loading with 24bit DataTypes.

   * 24bit Printing support via StudioPrint.

   *  Open  Architecture - Photogenics is effectively just one big collection of
   plug-ins  that  blends seamlessly to form one program. Third party developers
   can  have  access to the same API as Photogenics does, allowing developers to
   extend the core software to an amazing degree.

Minimum Requirements:

   * 68020, 8Mb RAM, Amiga OS 3.0, CD ROM drive.

Recommended Requirements:

   * 68060, 16 or 24bit display, 16Mb RAM, Amiga OS 3.0, CD ROM drive.

HI FROM TURKEY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Angel Alvarez Diaz,

I  have just found your magazine on my Aminet 30 cd and read everything in it. I
ought  to  say  that it's a very easy way to archive the month's news in a quick
way. Actually I found it very informative.

And let me indroduce my self a bit. My name is Berk Iybar and my nick on the net
is  Gaddar.  I  am  an  Amiga user from Istanbul/Turkey. Moreover,we also have a
magazine  on  the  net.  In  addition  to this I am the editor of this web based
webzine.

Our     mag   is   located   at   members.xoom.com/Amimaniacs   or   quick   way
amigamaniacs.cjb.net.  Not all the articles are in English (they are in Turkish)
but some like 3d, editorial and desktop are both English&Turkish.

That's all at the moment. Glorious Future is near. I think it's time to keep our
faiths.

Cu

 Berk Iybar(Gaddar)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for the letter Berk. I'm pleased to see that people from around the world
read  this  e-zine and still use their Amigas (this is the most important thing,
of course). By the way, I recommend everyone to visit their website.
