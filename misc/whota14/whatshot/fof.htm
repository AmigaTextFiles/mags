<FONT SIZE="6">S</FONT>ome of you may remember Fortress of
Fear from when the game was orginally announced quite a long time ago.  Some 
may have even thought they may have been abandoned it, well it hasn't 
been.<P>

For those of you that do not know, Fortress of Fear is an RPG game that is
similar in some respects to the excellent Diablo on the PC.  As well as
containing al the RPG elements you would expect there it will also contain a
number of action elements.  Like Diablo the game will be viewed from an
isometric perspective.<P>

The game is reported to be massive, the game will take part in one hugh world
instead of a number of small levels, of course, in this would you will be able
to explore villages, caverns, dungeons etc. there will be a number of quests to
be solved.<P>

The reason for the fact that there has been no news about the game recently is
that the team have taken a small break recently, this was for a number of
reasons.  This and the fact that they are trying to make the game as perfect as
possible before they release it has contributed to the demo & and game being
late.<P>

Dotted around this page you will see some images.  These are not actual
screenshots, however, they are the graphics that will be used in the game.  What
they will do is cut them down into blocks and use them to make up levels.  There
is also a screenshot from the intro and one of the main character.  I'm sure you
will be able to see why they are being touted as best graphics ever seen on the
amiga in a game of this type.<P>

Regarding the spec that will be needed to run the game, well, they are quite
high.  The minimum is an 030/50mhz with 4Mb RAM, a CD-ROM and a Hard-
drive. 
Obviously more power would be recommended.  At the moment they will be 
making
two Amiga versions, one for AGA and another for CyberGFX.  This is alongside the
PC version of the game they are producing.  In the future there is a chance of a
PowerPC version being developed.<P>

Currently the only release date that has been given is 1998, however, they are
aiming to get a demo finished by the end of 1997, but this is far from
certain.<P>
More on this game as I get it.
