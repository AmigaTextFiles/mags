<P>> Hi folks!  As I understand it, the Midwest Amiga Expo is on this weekend.  
I<br>
> was hoping someone might have some news from the show.  Of particular<br>
> interest to me is the keynote speech from Amiga International.  Does 
anyone<br>
> have access to news from this show??  Thanks!!<br>


<P>Well, I only managed to be there for a few hours, but man, I had one hell of
a good time! Petro gave a pretty standard Petro speech in which he revealed
that Quikpak had a licence, and that a large chunk had been invested in DCE,
I assume not because of the spec of their machines, but the overall design.
He said much and little at the same time, but I got the impression that he'd
have said more if allowed, obviously. He promised that the big news would be
at Cologne, and we should feel free to be there. What's to do but laugh? Now
that I've heard him speak in person, and even briefly talked one on one, I
don't believe him to be incompetent at all. He is just the head of one small
part of a larger Amiga whole, and I think he does his job well. Despite the
outdated spec of the clone machines, there will be a new Amiga, and current
liscencees will be the ones to produce it. If only a third of these groups
have any luck, the Amiga will survive for quite some time.

<P>One could rarely be farther than 3' (approx 1m) from another Amigan which,
if you ask me is refreshing. Honestly though, it was a very busy place for
the entire time I was there, and seemed to be in roughly the same amount of
space as last year. It was so hard to tell, as it really was that much more
packed. I felt as though there was a new optimism, and people really tried
hard to be there. If Computer '97 were to see a similar increase percentage
wise, it would flow into neighbouring towns.

<P>Aurora Works were there showing off their very impressive H-Bomb, with 
some
art by Eric Schwartz, who was also there. That boy never ceases to amaze...

<P>I touched a PowerUp card like the one I've got on order, and felt sorry for
the chap selling them as his credit arrangement didn't come through and he
could only take cash. Kermit signed my Aladdin4D manual, but neither of us
had the time for me to harass him any more than I did. I asked Vulcan US if
they would be doing any US development, but the best answer I could get was
that one of the World Foundry people was in the states. It seems to me that
they're just for distribution purposes at the moment.

<P>Compuquick had a large stack of goods, I picked up the new Format, but had
not the cash to look further. Still, I did snag a real nice Powered by Amiga
T shirt with the top 10 reason not to PC on the back. (#1? Win '95 Sucks!)
All in all, I had a great time. There may not have been much news, but there
was plenty going on.
