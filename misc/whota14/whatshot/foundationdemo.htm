<P>

<B>Note: AGA Users</B><P>

AGA users will need both the <B>FoundDemoAGA.lha</B> and 
<B>FoundMission.lha</B>
archives. It is also advised that you download the FoundSamples.lha otherwise
things will be kinda quiet, however, the game will work without it. The
FoundMugsAGA.lha is completly optional and is not required by the game.<P>

<B>Note: Graphics Card Users</B><P>

You will need both the <B>FoundDemoRTG.lha</B> and the 
<B>FoundMission.lha</B>
archives. As with the AGA version the <B>FoundSamples.lha</B> is 
recommeneded
but not required. Also the mugshots archive <B>FoundMugsRTG.lha</B> is 
completly
optional.<P>

It is important that you download the right versions as the AGA version will not
work on Graphic Card machines and vise-versa.<P>

The author will be uploading documentation (Which was missing from the upload)
and other bug-fixes, patches in the future.
