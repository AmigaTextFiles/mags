up Genetic Species news on the game has has been virtually none existent, but now 
however, here is the latest news and some stunning new screenshots on what looks 
to be the best 'Doom clone' on the Amiga.<P>

In the game you take control of a Bioshifter solving hundreds of puzzles and
encountering over 15 different enemies in over 40 levels.  Since the last demo
was released to the public the game has received many new features.  Things that
the game now boasts include AHI Support giving upto 16 channels, stunning
effects such as distance shading, shot lightsourcing and distoration mapping,
a massive selection on both friendly and enemy characters which have some
excellent AI which includes the characters group attacking and fighting
even fighting each other.<P>

The game also now boasts 30 minutes of high quality CD music and a massive 
200Mb
3D rendered intro animation.  There is also a very interesting feature that will
be included, it is called The Probe.  This allows both psyche travel
throughout the envirnoment and the ability to assume control of another entity. 
Once launched you control the direction of the probe while intertia carries it
forward, if the probe hits a stunned body (there are many ways of stunning an
enemy) it will take control of it.  You (The bioshifter) will then disconnect
from the old body and takeover the new one.<P>

The engine has also been worked on a lot, it was fast before but it is even
faster now.  Just an example of the speed - On a Cyberstorm 060, Picassio IV
with 10MB Fast RAM the game manages a stunning 50fps (The most a PAL monitor 
can
display) on all but the three highest screen sizes. On the highest screen size
(320x240) it still gets a very respectable 31fps.<P>

The game requirements have also changed slightly.  The minimun requirement of 
the
game is an AGA or CyberGFX/Picassio equiped machine with at least an 020,
harddrive, 4x CD-ROM drive and 10Mb RAM (8Mb Fast and 2Mb Chip), of course
anything more powerful then this will be used to the full.<P>

I'm sure all of you are wondering when you be able to try out Genetic Species in
it's current form, well, there will be a demo on the Christmas Edition of Amiga
Format CD. <P>

Currently a December '97 release is looking to be on the cards.<P>
