<img src=images/drv00.jpg alt="Drive U'Crazy" align=left WIDTH=247 
HEIGHT=115>Drive U'Crazy is being developed by Daztechnique Promotions and 
is a new high spec game being developed for multiple platforms including the 
Amiga, specificially on a 060 processor with a good quality graphics card.

HEIGHT=285>This game consists of 7 tracks and 3 Bonus tracks, in a new Ridge 
Racer style, a first for the Amiga.
They are currently trying their best to work this game on the minimum Amiga 
possible, but its unlikely
that the 3D mechanism will work 100% on anything less than a 060 processor with 
a good quality graphics card as reported earlier along with it being CD-Rom only.  
It will also include some really excellent Techno
music written by their in-house DJ's for this game.

<br>
Daztechnique Promotions hope to have a demo ready for early in the new year so 
we will see more then, but for now enjoy the screenshots shown here.

Hopefully, they will do a PowerPC version as people are going to be more likely to 
have a PowerPC accelerator card and maybe a CyberVisionPPC or BVisionPPC 
graphics card, than an 060.  More on this game as soon as I get it.
