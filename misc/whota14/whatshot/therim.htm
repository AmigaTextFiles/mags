Below is a press release from the author of 'The Rim' - a new Amiga game in 
development.<P>

The Rim (working title)<P>

I have currently started development on a game using a Diablo style engine set
in a futuristic setting. As I'm still a student though and I have a lot to do I
haven't got much time so I'm looking for people to assist me. I need people in
the area's of Graphics, c/asm coding, and music. I already got one Renderer, but
as the game will be quite large I sure could use more people there, especially
in the modeling department.<P>

I have permission to use the The World Foundry games background also used in
Explorer, M&M and licensed out to 2260 Designs for New Horizons. The World
Foundry team will also assist me with some things but they-re quite busy with
their own projects.<P>

If you want to assist me in this game, be it as a programmer, gfx man or even a
head-programmer, then contact me on this address: <A
HREF="mailto:martijns@sci.kun.nl">martijns@sci.kun.nl</a> With "Game" in the
subject line. At the moment we're still in the design stages but if all goes
according to plan this could be a great release.<P>

The royalties will be split, we will make out the details at a later stage.
