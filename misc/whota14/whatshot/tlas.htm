Contact:From: Terry L. Fike, <A

<P>In an effort to bring a little attention to the
new <A HREF="http://www.ole.net/~chaos/tlas/">Turtle Lightning Amiga Software 
(TLAS)</a> web site we have started a 'Specials'
page. This contains even lower than normal
prices for our web site visitors. Some are
even below our cost. We will change some of
these each month .


<P>TLAS also has started a 'Download' area where
folks can dowload a few freebies. These are
mostly things that were once in the TLAS
Licenseware but are now released to us to
freely distribute. We will be adding to this
area from time to time.

<P>We would also like to offer a 1O% discount on
all purchases of software from TLAS to all
<A HREF="../../supportawd98.html">CUCUG members</a> who have joined 
your group. We do
this in an effort to help increase your group
membership as well as making our site a bit
more attractive to members. They could indicate
that they are a member as the first item on
the sites order form. This offer cannot be used
in conjunction with other offers of % discount.


<P>This is an example of our Current Specials:
