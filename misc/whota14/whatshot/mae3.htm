<P>First off, I wish to thank all of the attendees of the <A 
HREF="http://www.cucug.org/tower-bin/cucug-ad-mae.pl">1997 Midwest Amiga 
Exposition</a>. We
had about 800 people visit us over two days (we're still working on a final count). 
And
secondly, I want to clarify a few things:

<P>Since my name appeared prominently on the documentation, website, and 
emails that were
sent out for the show, many people might have assumed that I was primarily 
responsible
for organizing and running this event. This simply is not true. Many people were
involved in the planning and execution of this event and deserve to be recognized 
for
their efforts.

<P><b>Ronn Black</b>: Ronn is the President of <A 
HREF="http://www.amicon.org/">AmiCON</a> for the last two years and was 
instrumental
in finding a place for this and last years show. He also coordinated the initial show
floor layouts, the various financial considerations, and was involved in every detail 
of
the planning and decision-making process. He contacted many of the more 
prominent
vendors and opened up channels of communication for Amiga Inc., NewTek (who
unfortunately, could not attend), and Amiga International. He was the primary 
person
responsible for seminar schedule coordination, banquet details, audio/visual support,
and the room in which all of these things took place. He was a valuable asset at the
show, by handling many of the issues that arose during the event. Incidently, 
without
Ronn, we would not have even had vendors for our first show. Ronn knew Kermit 
Woodall
and several other Amiga developers and through that network, we were able to 
garner
support.  Without those key people we would not have been able to convince other
developers and companies to support our show.

<P><b>Greg Finzer</b>: Greg is the Librarian officer for AmiCON for the last 
two years and spent
many extra hours helping coordinate AmiCON's presence at the show.  Greg 
coordinated the
T-Shirts and the other saleable items for AmiCON both for this year and last and 
even
set up the .html files on our website for preshow shirt orders. He was heavily 
involved
in the design of the mouse pads and T-Shirts and in obtaining permission to use the
"Powered by Amiga" logo from Amiga International. Greg was instrumental in 
selecting a
printer for our shirts and reveiwing, almost daily, the many logo changes necessary 
to
get a sharp image. Last year he spent countless hours on real-time video demos for 
the
AmiCON table and he also donated the use of his machine, this year and last year, 
for
display. He helped man the table for sales and was involved in the selection of this
years' location. At the same time, in addition to all this, Greg has spent many, 
many
hours on updating our sadly neglected BBS, converting it to CNet, setting up all of 
the
user screens, file areas, and CD Tower hardware.

<P><b>Kenneth Dean</b>: Ken is our Vice President and our primary show 
announcer. Ken was heavily
involved in the decision-making processes that helped coordinate this show and 
helped us
greatly with his valuable input. Ken spent almost all of his time at the Expo 
manning
our sales table, selling items, and answering hundreds of questions about the 
planned
events of the show. Ken spent many hours assembling the giveaway prizes for this 
years
show frequenting many local computer stores and mail order companies to find 
enough
worthy items for our hourly drawings. Incidently, Ken lives nowhere near any of 
these
stores, so not only did he have buy all of the items, but he had to travel many 
miles to
obtain them. Ken also attended and represented AmiCON at the User Group 
Network meeting,
held by reps from Amiga.org on Sunday.

<P><b>Bill Bennett</b>: Bill has been our Membership officer for the last two 
years. Bill had one
of the most difficult jobs for the show. Bill was responsible for coordinating people 
to
support the Expo. He handled schedules for the ticket tables and for many other
miscellaneous duties, too long to list here, where people were needed. Bill spent 
many,
many nights calling members, figuring out schedules, and making sure we had 
enough
people to help. Also, just in case, Bill had people coordinated for several vendors 
who
did not have enough support at the show, so that they could have a break and not 
leave
their tables unmanned. Bill was also responsible for planning many of the upfront
details of the show and helping to select the location for this years' event. Very
meticulous and able to see the "other side of the coin", Bill's common sense and 
input
helped guide us through decisions that could have been potential problems later.

<P><b>Dave Bartz</b>: Dave is the current Treasurer for AmiCON. Dave was 
also involved in the many
early details about the event and helped to decide between several choices in 
location.
Dave made sure the contractual details for the hotel were taken care of and kept in
close contact with the other planners to make sure the details and dollar amounts in 
the
contracts were correct. Dave helped us budget and plan for this event, and made 
sure the
money was in the bank to handle the bills after the show was over. He has also 
provided
us with all of the financial details following the Expo and kept all of our 
bookeeping
up-to-date and pertinent, which in itself, is no small task. Dave helped man the 
AmiCON
table, selling shirts and answering questions, for the two day event as well.

<P><b>Ray Hashman</b>: Ray has been a member of AmiCON for almost 5 
years. Ray was present at
almost all of our preliminary planning meetings, helped set up the ticket input form 
for
our website, and even joined us on his free time to look at the potential sites for 
the
show. Last year, he pledged his support to man the AmiCON table and demonstrate
real-time video animations, he and Greg Finzer created. Both Ray and Greg spent 
over a
week single-framing various scenes to create one of the coolest video displays I 
have
ever seen running real-time on a Non-Video Toaster Amiga. Ray donated his time 
and his
Amiga to displaying these and many other things at our show. This year, Ray also 
manned
our table, helped sell items, fed starving coordinators (blueberry bagels really hit 
the
spot!), once again brought his hardware, let people play on his machine, and 
helped
entertain everyone who walked by.

<P><b>Saul Hoffman</b>: Saul is one of our Officers-At-Large and helped out 
Paul Nolan of Siamese
Systems by letting Paul borrow his Amiga 2000.  The very 2000 that was part of 
the "Sick
2000 Workshop" a year earlier at our show.  Saul also helped take tickets as did 
many
others and has been a long-time invaluable member.  At one time Saul was our 
newsletter
editor and even had regular subscribers outside of AmiCON.

<P>There are also a whole list of members who donated their time and efforts to 
providing
the often unacknowledged leg work for the event.  These people helped take 
tickets,
helped exhibitors with issues, answered questions, ran various errands, carried 
around
equipment,  and countless other details, often working longer than asked. Our 
heartfelt
thanks goes to the following members for these and many other things (In 
alphabetical
order): <b>Chris Barbus,  Steve Cornett, Lou Gintner, Ralph Lupidi, Lonnie McKee, 
Joe Merz,
John Rule, John and Robin Six, Diane Teramana, Frank Tornichio,</b> and 
<b>Joe Vanyo</b>.

<P>And one very special thank you to <b>McIver Woody</b>, for providing 
the kernel for this idea,
way back in the Spring/Summer of 1996 and for being there to help out each year. 
We
couldn't have done it without you!

<P>Everyone listed above donated time and resources to make this event a 
reality. No one
gets any money for helping coordinate this event. All profit is put into the bank 
and
used to fund next years' show. If anyone thinks this is a profitable venture and that
AmiCON or individuals from AmiCON are getting paid by doing this, they need to 
think
again. For any profit we've put into the bank, we've spent 3-4 times that amount 
just to
rent facilities and pay expenses for the next event. Many, if not all of the people 
who
helped, also have families and full-time jobs to contend with. And some of these 
people
contributed money to pay for miscellaneous expenses from the event and will most 
likely
never be reimbursed fully.

<P>And one last thing: All AmiCON members and officers, no matter if they 
worked at the
event or not, paid the preshow price of $12.00 to get in.

<P>Thanks and we'll see you next year!

<P>Sincerely,

<P><b>David M. Pearce</b>
