<i>The following speech was delivered by Petro Tyschtschenko on
Saturday, November 1, 1997, on the show floor of the Midwest Amiga
Exposition in Columbus, Ohio.</i>


<b><P>Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Amigans, </b>

<P>
I'm very pleased to attend the <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/tower-bin/cucug-
ad-mae.pl">Amicon</a> which is indeed my first big
convention after <A HREF="http://www.gateway.com/">Gateway 2000 Inc.</a> 
acquired Amiga.

<P>This year on May 31, I was invited by the Amiga Atlanta User Group.
Out of this potential User Group, I met people who are attending the
Amicon today. Thank you very much for this invitation and for your
time to listen to me.

<P>As you know yesterday was Halloween and I was very pleased that
nobody beat me up, because I will not bring any "Sweets" - like news
from our Research & Development department.

<P>As you noticed already, Mr. Jeff Schindler, the general Manager of
our new founded Research & Development department, is not available
today. At the moment he is preparing a strategy road map which will be
announced at the Cologne fair.

<P>Today I do not intend to talk a lot about our history, because
everybody knows what had happened, how exciting and how glamorous and
sometimes how sad and negative our history was designed.

<P>You may remember my speech at the World of Amiga in London with Dr.
Jim Taylor, world-wide President Global Marketing of Gateway 2000,
Inc. on 18th May 97. In his speech, Dr. Jim Taylor pointed out
that Gateway 2000, has not bought Amiga to make is smaller. Gateway
2000 want the Amiga to grow.

<P>And indeed, at AMIGA International, Inc. we registered already
growth. We founded AMIGA International Inc. in Langen which is under
my direction and we are responsible for the Sales and Marketing
world-wide.

<P>In Germany we are in total 7 people. We are very successful in
selling our existing products world-wide. Besides Europe, we have
tremendous improvements regarding the sale in India and in Australia,
but our North American business is also increasing.

<P>Good news are that we will have for our <i>A1200 Amiga Magic Pack</i>,
which was until now only available in PAL, an NTSC version for the
North American market available beginning December 97.

<P>We also cut down our prices dramatically to build up the market for
our future products and to find new clients -- it's to convince by our
fantastic Amiga technology.

<P>We have negotiated with Quikpak about a license agreement, and it
is already signed a few days ago.

<P>As I already mentioned, it was founded a new company - Amiga Inc.
in South Dakota, close to Gateway 2000. Amiga Inc. is responsible for
the Research and the Development of new Amiga products, as well as
hard and software.

<P>The company is managed by Jeff Schindler. Currently in South Dakota
at Amiga Inc. there are working 5 people:

<P>
<DIR><b>Jeff Schindler</b>, General Manager<br>
<b>Darreck Lisle</b>, Event coordinator <br>
<b>Marylin Flint</b>, Operations manager<br>
<b>Joe Torre</b>, Senior engineer <br>
<b>Kelly Newby</b>, Bookkeeper<br>
</DIR>

<P>Coming back to AMIGA International world-wide sales and Marketing
activities out of Europe, they are as follows:

<ul>
<li> Supporting the existing Amiga community
<li> Leveraging the existing Amiga technology through brought licensing
<li> Assisting in developing new products based on open standards to the home 
computer and
video/graphics market.
</ul>

<P>Since March 97, I have visited and supported world-wide Amiga
activities to keep up our community. In Europe I was attending the
following conventions:

<ul>
<li> Heilbronn/Germany, Amiga User Meeting with Keith Bradach from Gateway 
2000
<li> Trier/Germany, Convention called "Magic Days"

</ul>

<P><b>New hardware based on Amiga OS 3.1</b> <br>
REC (USA) China/Europe, with their Wonder TV <br>
</DIR>

<P>The next big convention is coming soon which will be the Cologne
fair called "Computer 97" starting 14th to 16th November 97.

<P>For years, the fair was called, "The World of Commodore" and than
after Commodore's bankruptcy it was changed into "Computer with the
current year". It was the largest Amiga fair world-wide. In 1995 there
were more than 60,000 people attending the show.

<P>Last year when Amiga Technologies was under bankruptcy protection,
there was no fair booth and I was sitting around like an refugee and I
tried hard to represent Amiga outgoing from foreign booths. This
situation affected also the figures of visitors. The figure dropped
to only 35,000 in 3 days,

<P>During the opening ceremony last year, I promised to be back in
1997 -- and indeed I achieved this goal. AMIGA International will have
a big fair booth with about 2,000 square feet. AMIGA International
will not sell any products during the fair. We will represent the
Amiga technology and the licensed technology.

<P>In our booth, following companies are exhibiting and demonstrating
their products - powered by Amiga:

<ul>
<li> HI Q Limited, UK
<li> Haage & Partner, Germany
<li> Index Information, UK
<li> Micronik, Germany
<li> Herrn Holger Kruse, USA (<i>Miami</i> Internet Software)
<li> Angela Schmidt, Germany (CD burning)
</ul>

<P>The biggest enrichment is that we can show the new designed boards
by DCE Computer Service GmbH. This board is based on the A4000 with
following features: There will be 2 versions available

<DIR><P><b>A 5000 </b><br>
CPU 68030/50 Mhz <br>
Up to 64 MB Ram <br>
Standard PC Keyboard <br>
1.44 MB Floppy Disk <br>
1.7 Gbyte IDE HDD <br>
10 - 24 Speed IDE CD ROM <br>
AGA Chipset <br>
Scan Doubler <br>
HF Modulator optional <br>

<P><b>A6000 </b><br>
CPU 68060/50 Mhz <br>
Up to 128 MB RAM <br>
Standard PC Keyboard <br>
1.44 MB Floppy Disk <br>
1.7 Gbyte IDE HD <br>
10 - 24 Speed IDE CD ROM <br>
AGA Chipset <br>
Scan Doubler <br>
HF Modulator optional <br>
</DIR>

<P>I think this product will be very successful in our near future. It
will help us to keep the market alive and growing. For further
information, please watch <A 
HREF="http://www.dcecom.de/">http://www.dcecom.de/</A>.

<P>This year in Cologne we expect more than 60,000 visitors, 80% of
them will be Amiga fanatics. In well organized workshops, the
following companies will be represented through News and Information.

<ul>
<li> Phase 5 - workshop Power PC and strategy
<li> Cloanto-Amiga Forever, a hot discussion item
<li> Haage & Partner- Internet & Java, Compiling C code using Storm C, linking 
and creating executable
<li> Nova Design-Alladin 4D-an old friend is back,
<li> Cinemorph - faster and faster
<li> Image FX
<li> And Vulcan Software from England will present their new Genetic Demo.
</ul>

<P>Due to the world-wide shortage of Amiga video monitors, AMIGA
International will also demonstrate how to use a standard PC monitor
with our beloved Amiga.

<P>I think it is very important, that we explore an open Amiga
platform, use industry standard components to reduce the production
costs, to make it faster to develop and easier to upgrade. I will try to
reach this goal in a very managed fashion.

<P>Highlights of the Cologne fair will be the long expected
announcement about the <b>Future of Amiga</b>. Which will be stated at the
developer conference on Friday evening at 7 p.m.

<P>Jeff Schindler will explain the strategy and roadmap for our future.

<P>Now, my friends, I'm already at the end of my speech and Today I
had the great pleasure again to stand here and to give you a short up
to date. I'm convinced that we will meet each other several times
within the next years.

<P>My personal opinion is: Amiga has a bright future ahead!

<P>Thank you for being here And many thanks to the people who
organized this big and successful event.
