THE FINAL ODYSSEY - This masterpiece of a game will be released at the
end of November  best described as an Action/Adventure/Puzzler, the
Final  Odyssey combines detailed and entertaining graphics and gameplay
to  perfection. You play the part of Theseus on his quest to free six
rather  lovely maidens from the evil clutches of the Minotaur. The Final
Odyssey is so vast that we have been unable to reach the end (somewhat
disturbing as we're supposed to be testing it) but then rather
unsurprising as some of the levels reconstruct themselves everytime you
play......

<P>Peter Spinaze is Vulcan's multi talented developer of this fine game.
The beautifully crafted graphics in The Final Odyssey have won Peter a
scholarship at Silicon Studio which is a state of the art international
facility dedicated to training digital artists.

<P>Silicon Studio is one of only 3 flagship training centres world-wide and
is the most advanced digital media training centre in the industry in
the Asia Pacific region to date.

<P>Peter's particular scholarship is a 3D Animation scholarship. He is
using Alias/Wavefront PowerAnimator as his 3D Rendering software and
using the latest Silicon Graphics hardware.  The same gear they used to
make
Jurassic Park etc. The hardware consists of O2's, Octane's, and an Onyx2
Infinite Reality supercomputer.

<P>We are all very proud of him here at Vulcan but not at all surprised.

<P>Kind Regards<br>
