<P>
Alive MediaSoft are currently working on a number of games for release in 1998. 
This is in addition to trying to get The Haunted finished and released (Looking
like being Early 1998 at the moment).<P>

One of these future games is called Arcangel.  This is a very high specification
game requiring at least an AGA machine with 16Mb and a CD-ROM drive, the 
game
will also support PowerPC.  At the moment, however, the game is only on paper. 
Alive have one programmer who will be dedicated to bringing the game to the
Amiga, however, more are required.<P>

This is where you come in.  Alive require a competent Assembly Language
programmer to help with the project.  This person must also have the capability
to code for modem links.<P>

Anyone who is interested please contact Alive along with either a CV or a
portfolio of previous work to Andrew Reed via either Email or post.<P>
