<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b>

<P>The totally free Spanish electronic magazine called '<A 
HREF="http://www.arrakis.es/amiga/">AmigaChannel</a>' has
reached its 10th issue. And we do it in style.

<P>Along with numerous news bytes and briefs (this month bigger than ever),
product announcements, we bring you our usual columns ('Padre Newton',
Scene, Games,...).

<P>But the most strong point of this issue is an exclusive interview with
Petro Tyschtschenko presidente de 'Amiga International'.

<P>Our reporters have been really bold. It is the first interview in which
all the questions that worry to the Amiga community have been asked: the
relationships with 'Phase 5' and David Pleasance, the next developments,
<P>...

<P>Taking into account the importance of this interview, you can read it
(both in English and in Spanish) in the SAU ('Spanish Amiga Users') WEB
(<A HREF="http://www.arrakis.es/amiga/">http://www.arrakis.es/amiga/</A>). 
Visit our WEB today and I assure you that
you won't be disappointed.

<P>Thanks for reading,

<P>Victor Garcia Valero<br>
