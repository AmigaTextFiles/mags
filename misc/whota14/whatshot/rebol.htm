<P>
The Alpha-test version of <A
HREF="http://www.rebol.com/">REBOL/Core</a> is in its final stage of
development and internal testing. Over the last month the software has
become stable enough to use for important jobs, such as running our
email list server (Rebot) and converting our reference documentation
to HTML. Over the week ahead we will be finishing a few important
documents and will begin to distribute the main program,
documentation, and examples to the people on our <A
HREF="http://www.rebol.com/#maillist">Email Announcement List</a> who
have asked to test it.


<P><b>Why just an Alpha Release?</b>

<P>This release of REBOL/Core is packed with many useful datatypes and
functions; however, we consider this to be an Alpha because some of
the main concepts are still evolving. We need the freedom to continue
to improve REBOL's core technology without concern for compatibility
of an application base.

<P>In other words... function names and operations are subject to
change as testing proceeds. (Prototypes testers should expect that the
Alpha will be different from the earlier versions.) In addition there
are a number of crucial features that are not currently implemented
that we would like to include in the Beta release.

<P><b>REBOL on Multiple Platforms!</b>

<P>During October Carl ported the REBOL/Core to a few other platforms,
primarily as a test of kernel code computability. The Alpha version
now runs on the Amiga, Linux (X86), PC, and Macintosh. All of these
will be available for Alpha release, and we expect to add other
platforms in the months ahead.

<P><b>How to obtain REBOL</b>

<P>REBOL is not yet available for general distribution. However, if
you would like a private copy of the Alpha release for testing, join
our Email List for information and instructions.

<P><b>What Does it Cost?</b>

<P>We are planning to release REBOL as shareware ($50 US) for private
non-commercial and educational uses. This will be a fully enabled
version, with no sly shareware limitations, tricks, or gimmicks.
Commercial, packaged, and licensed versions will also be available for
businesses, institutions, and government use. However, we remain open
to your comments on this topic.
