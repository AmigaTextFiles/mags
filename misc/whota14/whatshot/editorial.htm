Hi,
<p>
This is the fourth editorial for the What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine, and yet 
again, a lot has happened since the release of the last issue, with two on-line 
versions of What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine now fully operational at <A 
HREF="http://www.koyote.com/users/jbb/whota/main.htm">http://www.koyote.com/
users/jbb/whota/main.htm</A> and at <A 
HREF="http://www.sonic.net/~alanwall/whota/index.html">http://
www.sonic.net/~alanwall/whota/index.html</A>.  
<p>
But also you will have noticed that the colour scheme has changed and this is 
because on trying to get the one of the on-line editions of What's Hot On The 
Amiga Magazine on the Amiga Web Directory, it was noticed that the some of 
coloured backgrounds beared a strong resemblance to those at the Amiga Web 
Directory, so I changed them.  Hope, that you like them.
<p>
Hopefully, you did eventually get to read the last issue which even had been 
uploaded to the Aminet, didn't make it into the recent uploads on time due to a 
disk crash.
<p>
This issue contains a number of articles on the MidWest Amiga Expostion, an article 
on REBOL and also Foundation making it's presence known in this issue's <A 
HREF="nib.htm"> News In Brief</A> and in the <A 
HREF="foundationdemo.htm">Foundation Demo Out</A> article.  But, there is a 
still of other news out there, with the collection 
of articles split more or less evenly by game news and the more serious stuff.  But, 
in this issue, there are also couple of exclusives such as the <A 
HREF="myst.htm">Latest On Myst</A>, <A 
HREF="metalweb.htm">MetalWeb</A>, <A HREF="yam.htm">YAM 
2.0</A> and <A HREF="maepics.htm">MAE Pics</A> articles., with many 
thanks going out to <B>Alan Crandall</B> who sent me them and also for his 
offer of web space for What's Hot On The Magazine at <A 
HREF="http://www.sonic.net/~alanwall/whota/index.html">http://
www.sonic.net/~alanwall/whota/index.html</A>.  
<P>
The <A HREF="yam.htm">YAM 2.0</A> article appeared in 
whota13.lha, but the article included in whota13.lha gave people problems 
regarding image decoding, well the <A HREF="yam.htm">YAM 2.0</A> article 
included in this issue, all the images do indeed decode and are viewable.  Sorry, if 
caused anybody any problems.
<P>
A number of new sites have made their way into <A 
HREF="links.htm">Links</A>, since the last issue and are all worth a look.
<P>
Now this month's, Site Of The Month is <A 
HREF="http://www.rebol.com">Rebol</A>, which is Carl Sassenrath's vision of 
what computing should be like and not the way that it is now.  An alpha version is 
only currently available to those on the E-mail list.  Keep an eye on this site.
<p>
In the next issue, there will be a number of articles on more games, along with 
other stuff, and expect a lot of articles on the Computer97 along with an article 
hopefully on the new Amiga that AI have planned.
<P>
Before, I end this issue's editorial, I'm still accepting anymore offers of free web 
space as I'd like to have a mirror site as well, if you have any, then e-mail me at:
<p>
<A 
HREF="mailto:imortimer@jupmqljb.demon.co.uk">imortimer@jupmqljb.demon.co.
uk</A>
<P>
And also I'm looking contributions of news articles or links, they will be greatly 
appreciated, so just e-mail them to me at:
