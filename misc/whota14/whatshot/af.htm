Amiga Format's December Issue has just been released with the CD Issue carrying 
Exclusive Demo's of Vulcan Software's, Uropa 2 and The Final Odyssey.  So don't 
miss this issue of Amiga Format.
<br>
The Final Odyssey a puzzling action adventure leaves you in control of Theseus the 
Hero to solve the complex puzzles and mysteries of the Labyrinth and eventually 
destroy the Minotaur as well as locating all the girls that have been imprisoned and 
getting them out safely.
<br>

<img src=images/tfoshot4.gif alt="The Final Odyssey Character" align=right>In 
the full game you will have to deal with Flamers, Arrows, Electric Bolts, Pits, Spikes, 
Rolling Rocks, Bouncing Balls, Homing Missiles, One-Way Paths, Invisible Walls, 
Trap Doors, Transporters, Lava Timed Bombs, Fall-Away Tiles and more importantly 
with loads of Monsters each with their own advanced artificial intelligence.  To kill 
the enemy that you encounter you have an assortment of weapons - Crossbow, 
Plasma Rifle, Chain Gun, Fireblade and a Nuke.  Of course this is not all available in 
the demo but it will give you a peak at what you should expect from The Final 
Odyssey.

Austex Software and about to be Published by Vulcan Software is my own personal 
favourite game with it being so original, having so many clever ideas, hidden 
surprises, it is game that offers so much to the player.

It will contain 10 gigantic strategy based missions with a linear plot progression 
including full digital speech throughout.  Your weapons will also progress 
throughout and it will have the option for Serial Link up for 2 player action with an 
extra Hovar Wars game.

Overall, it would be a good idea to buy this month's Amiga Format to get a look at 
these soon to be released games.
