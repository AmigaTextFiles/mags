To:  All Amiga fans across the Internet.<br>
From: "Mathew R. Ignash" <<A 
HREF="mailto:mignash@rust.net">mignash@rust.net</A>>

<P>Just to let you know that the <A 
HREF="http://www.rust.net/~mignash/hm.html">Honorable Mention</a> web 
page has exceeded
500 total articles.  As you probably know Honorable Mention
indexes positive mentions of the Amiga computer in the non-Amiga specific
press so you can find out what is being said about our favorite computer.

<P>Many of my articles includes links to full text, mail to links to the
authors, and links to the news sources home page.

<P>Some new features I have added in HM include a Recent Articles page
so you can quickly link to stories dated within the last two months
as well as links to model specs, technical terms and company home pages
whenever mentioned in an article.

<P>Please stop by at <A 
HREF="http://www.rust.net/~mignash/hm.html">http://www.rust.net/~mignash/hm.
html</A> to view news
coverage of the Amiga from the latest word, all the way back
to reviews of the Amiga Inc. Joyboard and Powerstick 13 years ago,
and everything in between.

<P>Thank you,

<P>Mathew R. Ignash
