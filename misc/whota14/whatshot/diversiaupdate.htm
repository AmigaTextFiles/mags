<FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>t's been a while since I looked at this game and it 
has
progressed quite nicely in that time. The game is now 65% complete and is
beginning to look like it could be something really special. One thing that does
need clearing up regarding the game is what has happened to the demo. Well, it
has actually been released, however, only to interested publishers. They thought
it better to hold the demo back until we are closer to the games release.<P>

Since the last news article there has been a lot of new features added to the
game.  The total number of buildings that the game now has is up to 16, these
range from simple Power Stations & Oil Mines to factories and laser turrents. 
There have also been a variety of air units added, you can see the a picture
showing one of these, the helicopters, on this page.<P>

Two of the screenshots on this page are from the Low-Res version, to some the
buildings/units may look rather large, well, if so then the Hi-Res version is
for you.  The other screenshot here is from this version and I'm sure you'll
agree, it looks excellent.  However, to play it at any kind of speed you'll need
an 040/40.  On a 030/50 or anything less it just isn't playable.  Seems
like another reason to get that upgrade if you ask me.  In fact it is
actually possible to play the game in resolutions of 800x600 and 1024x768,
how fast they are though, I don't know.  For most though, I'm sure the Low-Res
version will be quite Ok.<P>

Other features that have been added include animation to buildings, a bubble
help option, an increase in terrain size - now 1024x1024, 2048x2048 & 
4096x4096
are supported, an improvment in the pathfinder and much more.  Something that
will please Graphics Card owners is that the game has now been successfully been
tested on CyberGFX systems.<P>

Things still to add include many new units and building, research facilitys,
improved CPU intelligence, a network mode, video-phone messaging and much
more.<P>

Like I said, the game still has quite a distance to go before it is finished,
however, the authors are looking to release the game either Late '97 or Early
'98.
