<b><P>DESCRIPTION</b>

<P> As you may know the A3000 and the Tower make use of ZIP-type
Memory which was inexpensive in the past but now is highly
overpriced.

<P>Simmfonie simply implements the SIMM sockets in the A3000.
Of course you could still pay somewhere between $10 to $15 USD per
meg for SC ZIP Ram. The ZIP Ram only provides a slight speed
advantage, about 15%.  That is hardly worth paying the extra
money.

<P>Simmfonie can use EDO ram but there are no speed benefits.  This
is a limitation of the chipset used in the A3000(T) not Simmfonie.

<P>Faster SIMMs are recommended because there is hardly any price
difference at all.  As well, faster SIMMs would be more useful
when upgrading to a CPU board that has on board SIMM sockets.  You
could use 4MB or 8MB modules.  The 8MB module is recommended
because there are only two SIMM slots available on the SIMMfonie
for a maximum of 16MB fast ram.

<P>Simmfonie uses an industrial HQ board and golden steel connectors
which are placed in the ZIP sockets on the mainboard of the
A3000(T).

<b><P>INSTALLATION</b>

<P>The installation is more difficult than it is for a Zorro board.
If you follow the step by step instructions outlined in the manual
it is no problem.  None of the Simmfonie adapters have been
returned due to a defect in the product.  No machine or memory
problems have been reported after installation.


<b><P>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</b>

<P> Make sure to request the proper model of Simmfonie.  There is a
 different version for the A3000T.

<P>* following are the original non edited comments by the development group

<P><DIR>        You'll need A3000 _not_ the Tower for this expansion...
        (there is a different one for the tower).
        Different to the board used for the Tower it's not possible to use
        the adapter together with a CPU board. Even it wouldn't be a
        useful solution.
