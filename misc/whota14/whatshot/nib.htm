Welcome to the News In Brief Section.  This page contains all articles from 1st - 
15th November.  Enjoy.

<CENTER><H2>Main Aminet Site Goes Down</H2></CENTER>
<P>
On Sunday 2nd November, the main Aminet site at Wuarchive went down, and this 
has meant that whota13.lha which has been uploaded to the Aminet isn't available 
from the recent uploads as yet, but it should be soon.

<CENTER><H2>The Shadow Of The Third Moon Out Soon</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The Shadow Of The Third Moon has been in a number of articles in October, well 
here is the latest.
<P>
I have recently been imformed that 'The Shadow of the Third Moon' is now very
close to release.  You may have read elsewhere that the game had already been
released, this is not true, however, the game IS finished.  CD production for
the game started on Friday the 31st of October.  The official presentation of
the game is set for the Computer '97 show in Koln, Germany on the 14th of
November.  It is from this date that the game will be available.<P>

For those of you who do not know, The Shadow Of The Third Moon is an 
excellent looking flight simulation that uses a voxel engine, a first on the Amiga.  
The demo received a warm welcome when it was released a couple of months ago,
however there were a few problems and that these problems have all been fixed in 
the final version.<P>

<CENTER><H2>The New ICOA Website Is Unveiled & Other ICOA 
News</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The following is from the <A HREF="http://www.netreach.net/~fleecy/icoa/">ICOA 
web site</A>.
<p>
The DevCon at the Midwest Amiga Exposition saw two big news items for the ICOA.

<UL>

  <LI>Kermit Woodall of the Amiga Developers Network announces that the ADN 
and the

 ICOA will merge, resulting in the concentration of developer support and 
representation

 into one single organisation.

  <LI>Joe Torre of Amiga Inc. hands over the all official developer registrations 
forms

 received to date in an official acknowledgement that the ICOA will be the 
single,

 formal channel between Amiga Inc. and the developer community.

</UL>
<p>
The new ICOA website is unveiled. We hope that this format will more closely

demonstrate the eventual facilities and services that the ICOA will provide, both at a 

public level, for the benefit of the whole community and at a private level, for the 

benefit of the members.<BR><BR>The site itself has many areas that have not 
been 

implemented. As resources become available and we move forwards, then the site 
will

expand. Please bear with us for now.

<CENTER><H2>Follow-up to Trapped 2 in development</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/trafol.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Trapped 3 screenshot"
HSPACE="10"> <FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT> have recently been informed that 
Oxyron,
the authors of Trapped & Trapped 2 have a follow-up to these two games in
development. As yet, the game has not been named, however, instead of selling it
as a sequel the game will probably be sold as a completly new game.<P>

Details are very low at the moment, however, you will be able to see the engine
in action at the Computer '97 show.  I am told that they have worked on the 3D
engine quite a lot and the game is now looking much better then Trapped 2,
hopefully the gameplay will have been improved too.<P>

On this page you can find the first ever screenshot of the game, don't take this
as being what the final game will look like though as it is a very early 'work
in progress' screenshot.<P>

The authors plan to have a demo ready for the early part of 1998.<P>
<CENTER><H2>Uropa Released</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/uroparel1.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Uropa Screenshot">
Uropa has finally been released to the Amiga community.  The game that was
originally released as Shareware earlier this year has received a commercial
release from Vulcan Software.<P>

The game should be available from your local Amiga games supplier very 
soon.<P>

<CENTER><H2>Latest On Foundation</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Foundation will now be released at the end of January 98, and there is no way that 
will be out before Christmas as it is still being coded.
<P>
But here is a list of additions that will be made to the game between now and the 
end of December.<P>
<UL>
<LI>At least 4 different types of Peasants
<LI>Blood and Guts in Fights - Better fight sequences
<LI>Ships and Shipyards
<LI>Hot Air Balloons - For transportation and aerial attacks
<LI>All 3 types of Knights - Ranks
<LI>Archers
<LI>Warrior Wizard - A new wizard who can indulge in fights, and
                   being able to cast spells such as fire balls etc.
                   This wizard is only available after being able to
                   train a peasant (in a wizard Hut) for several years.
<LI>TCP/IP
<LI>Diseases and Plagues - It would be good to have flies flying around
                         a character's head, if he touches another 
                         character, then the disease is passed on.  
                         Hospitals need to be invented and research
                         into medicine.
<LI>Walls - You will be able to  build walls and you can also raise and lower 
        land, but only land owned by your team, not enemy ground.  This 
        could be done by selecting Raise/Lower then this will highlight 
        a square on the main playing area, left and right mouse buttons
        can then raise or lower the land.
<LI>Catapults - It would be good to be able to catapult diseased cows, 
                    flaming rocks etc.  (This would only be implemented if
                    Paul can add it)
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
There will be a demo displayed at the Cologne Show 97, so look out for 
that.  There should also be a demo uploaded to Aminet this week, so again,
look out for that.

<b>Amiga Forever 1.0 Preview Edition Shipping</b>

<P>Given the strong interest expressed by users after the original
announcement of Amiga Forever, a special "Preview Edition" of Amiga
Forever, with a version number of 1.0, has been released, slightly ahead
of the planned schedule. This version allows the more
technically-experienced users to immediately explore many of the
features of the final release, without paying an additional price (the
list price of the upgrade from the preview version to the final version
will not be higher than the difference between the two).


<P>For additional information please refer to the Amiga Forever Home page
at <A 
HREF="http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/forever/">http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/for
ever/</A>. The page has been recently
extended with a Frequently Asked Questions section.

<CENTER><H2>Latest On Championship Manager 2</H2></CENTER>
<P>
I've just heard that Championship Manager 2 an football management sim for the 
Amiga has just passed the final stage of testing, with Edios Interactive expecting it 
to be released before Christmas.
<br>
<br>
The masters are said to being examined for duplication.  Championship Manager 2 
is one of the most awaited games for the Amiga has nearly took 2 years to be 
released.
