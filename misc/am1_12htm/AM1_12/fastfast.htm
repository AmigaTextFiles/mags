<P ALIGN="LEFT">As my 14400 Sportster was beginning to look a little less "sporty" than when I first plugged it into the net, and a happy circumstance provided an opportunity for an upgrade to a newer, flashier model with go faster stripes, I recently decided to take the step up to 33.6K. I originally intended to go for Active Software's Netconnect package, but after scanning the pages of various magazines, I went for a package which included a faster serial port and some software, as well as the modem, for roughly the same price as Active's Dynalink modem and software suite.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The package arrived, and I investigated the various boxes. The review which follows is divided into three parts, as there is a great deal of variance between the quality of some parts of the package and others.</P>
	
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">The Whippet</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This fast serial port from HiSoft computing is basically a version of their Surf Squirrel without a SCSI port.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The manual is clear and informative, and installation is extremely simple.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Whippet comes as a slim black box which slides into the PCMCIA port on the side of the 1200, and you plug your 9-pin modem cable into the rear of it.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There is an installer supplied, but all it does is copy whippet.device into your DEVS: directory. After the recommended reboot, and configuring Miami (not supplied) for the modem, I dialled up my ISP. With the serial speed in Miami set to 115200, downloading was a whole new experience. Running IBrowse, simultaneous FTP of three files from the Omnipresence support site was smooth and fast.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The World Wide Wait is now a lot shorter, and as a bonus, the Whippet can apparently manage port speeds up to 230400, meaning it should be able to cope with the new 56K modems, when they become available, and probably ISDN too.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">The Enterprise Modem</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well what can I say about a modem? It comes in a nice cream, aerodynamically-shaped case, with the required lights on the front, that flash on and off engagingly. It beeps and whistles, and it does the job.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There is a useful Phone Jack on the rear, and there is also a combined socket for a speaker and microphone, which enables you to use it as a speakerphone.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The fax function works well, although I had to use my PC to test this, as no Amiga Fax software is provided. The Manual comes on a PC disk with the supplied PC software (which is surprisingly good), as an ASCII file, so you'll need a PC to read it, but you will probably not need any more info than that on the quick setup slip.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One minor point - there is no on/off switch, and when I switched it off at the wall socket, it crashed my machine. As my whole system is powered on an extension with one power switch, this is not really a problem for me, and you can switch it off (with no adverse effect) by removing the power plug from the back.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Power Net & Web Software</H3>
	
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is the downside of the package. Although there is a registered version of the excellent IBrowse, the other included software is of remarkably poor quality compared to the rest of the bundle.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Built around an old (V3 beta) version of AmiTCP, limited to SLIP connection to Demon Internet, together with a poor e-mail client and an unstable FTP client, Net & Web is frankly disappointing, even though there is an offer of a free month's access from Demon.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Still, the rest of the package is excellent value for money without the software, and works well, so this is only a minor complaint.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Whippet is also available direct from HiSoft for UKP49.95 and I advise anyone considering moving to 33.6 to speed up their serial port. The 1200 can only reliably manage 38400 through its built-in port. I experimented using the modem with and without the whippet, and there was a vast improvement.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I still intend to buy the Netconnect software from Active as soon as Version 2 comes out. There is a demo version available of Version 1, which I have tried and found very good.</P>
