<P ALIGN="LEFT">Another month has gone by, and the fun continues in the Amiga community. This time, new stories have come out about licensing and the sale of technology, and there have been some interesting disputes. Rather than repeat what our editors have prepared for you, however, I'll refer you to The Sam Report and The Tone Byte below for more information.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Not too long ago, I was wondering what I was going to write here this month. Writer's block? Well, no. Actually, we started planning some of the changes to be made and special stories and features to be written for next month, which will be, believe it or not, the first issue of Volume 2 of The Amiga Monitor. We intended to make this a fairly short issue, in preparation for the special one-year anniversary issue, simply because of the time involved.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">So we prepared to do that, and I prepared to think of something equally condensed to write here, but the writers went and surprised us. Yep, while we thought this issue would be relatively small, I received a number of articles which filled it out fairly well anyway. So, I'm pleased to say, here is the July issue, just about normal-size; but we also promise something extra special for next month, including a retrospective, and a view to what the future may hold for the Amiga, and for The Amiga Monitor. And plenty more, of course.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This month, we have some articles from Steve Duff and Leo Maxwell, both of whom have written for AM before. There is also some interesting material from Greg Noggle and Bill Graham, and the editorial staff came through with the ever-timely Sam Report and Tone Byte, thanks to Sam Ormes and Anthony Becker. I won't give away all the secrets, though; there are a few more items "hidden" below in the Table of Contents.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, as they say, "I'm outta here!". After all, there is plenty of work and preparation to be done. So I'll see you next month!</P>
