@{FG Shine}Welcome to @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 4rd issue of @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}.

Now,  it's  official. Although it was officially canceled at the @{B}World of Amiga@{UB},
it  seems that the @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} has reconsidered his decision and the @{B}Amiga OS 3.5@{UB}
will  be  finally  released  in  the  first half of next year. I guess that this
change  is  mainly  due  to  the  proposal  signed by @{I}Jurgen Haage@{UI} (from @{B}Haage &
Partner@{UB}),   @{I}Wolf   Dietrich@{UI}   (from  @{B}Phase  5@{UB})  and  @{I}Mick  Tinker@{UI}  (from  @{B}Access
Information@{UB}), just after the notorious @{B}WoA@{UB} announcement.

I  think  this is good news. Finally, they are doing something everybody wanted.
And  the  most  important  thing  is  that they are more accessible to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community. In the last month, I've read more than 5 interviews with @{I}Fleecy Moss@{UI},
including the published by @{B}CU Amiga@{UB} in its last issue. What, who is this guy?

He  is in charge of the developer relations and strategic projects at @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}.
Unlike  @{I}Jeff  Schindler@{UI}  and @{I}Bill McEwen@{UI}, @{I}Fleecy@{UI} is an @{UB}Amiga@{UB} user, just like you
and  I.  He  knows  all  the pain we suffered in the past. Even, he is trying to
finnish  the  excellent @{UB}Cannon Fodder@{UB} ;) He participates in a monthly conference
by  IRC. He is the only one at Amiga Inc. who could bring a new "product" to the
Amiga  community whose name is @{I}Evie@{UI}... well actually she was "manufactured" by a
third party company (his wife ;)).

As  you may guess, the @{B}OS 3.5@{UB} will not be any revolution in the computing world.
In  fact,  it  will  bring  what we have now, mainly due to the limited time and
budget  of  the  project.  The planned big "changes" will be the new look of the
Workbench  and  the  integration  of  the  hundred of patches our @{B}Amigas@{UB} are now
running to be more usable. Anyway, you will find out all the information we have
at the moment in the articles section.

Sadly,  I'm  afraid  it  is too late. This last revision of the Operating System
must have been released at the @{B}Computer' 98@{UB}, as it was initially planned (before
@{B}WoA@{UB}  I  mean).  So  many developers left the @{B}Amiga@{UB} when @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} announced the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  Classic  was  not  going  to  be  supported by them. For instance, @{B}Vulcan
Software@{UB}  are about to leave the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. The development of @{B}Hard Target@{UB}, a @{B}Virtua
Cop@{UB} clon for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} has been ceased, and it seems @{B}Desolate@{UB} is about to follow
the same path.

And  what  about  @{B}Phase  5@{UB}?  I'm afraid that they are about to leave as well. It
seems they will not be attending @{B}Computer 98@{UB}. Sad news, isn't it?

As,  @{I}Paul  Carrington@{UI},  from @{B}Vulcan Software@{UB}, recently said "Live as Long as You
Can and Proper"

Remember to visit the @{B}SAUG@{UB} website, which is located in:

        @{B}http://www.saug.com/@{UB}

or you can visit its mirrors located in:

        @{B}http://soporte.databasedm.es/amiga/sau/@{UB}

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

        @{I}angel@saug.org @{UI}

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.

@node not03 "INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF YAM"

INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF @{B}YAM@{UB}
----------------------------------------

From: @{I}Marcel Beck@{UI} @{I}mbeck@access.ch@{UI}
Date: Fri, 18 Sep 1998 18:44:06 +0200

@{I}@{B}YAM 2@{UB} Development@{UI}

Developing  of  @{B}YAM  2.0@{UB}  is  progressing rather slowly, because my job and some
other  projects  are  keeping  me  busy. Nevertheless, here's a list of the most
important enhancements you can expect in the next release:
 * If  you're using @{B}Miami@{UB}, @{B}YAM@{UB} can now detect if you're online and doesn't check
   for new mail if @{B}Miami@{UB} is running but offline.
 * When  replying  to  a message, the text is now reformatted to a smaller width
   before actually quoting it.
 * You  can  now  enter  a  group alias in the "To" field; you no longer have to
   create a distribution list containing all entries of that group.
 * @{B}YAM@{UB}  now supports openurl.library, a shared library that passes links from an
   application to your preferred browser.
 * Charset translation now works in the message headers too.
 * Importing and exporting of mail is now much faster (by a factor of 2-3).
 * Line/column  display  in  the  internal  editor,  the  toolbars  and  the new
   status/progress bar in the main window can be optionally switched off.

This  is  only  a  small excerpt from what I've done so far. There are dozens of
other  changes  and  bug  fixes.  The  internal  @{B}beta15@{UB} will be sent to the beta
testers soon, the public @{B}preview 6@{UB} will follow.

@{I}Major bugs in @{B}YAM 2P5@{UB}@{UI}

These are the major (and most reported) bugs in @{B}YAM 2 Preview 5@{UB}:
 * Multi-user   support  doesn't  work:  The  'Add  user'  button  in  the  user
   configuration is not displayed.
 * While  downloading  mail,  @{B}YAM@{UB}  displays  wrong  address etc. in the transfer
   window.
 * Delete action in filters doesn't work.
 * The   address  book  doesn't  display  the  columns  you've  defined  in  the
   configuration.
 * Copying messages mixes up the index.
 * @{B}YAM@{UB}  crashes when selecting the 'Misc' page in the configuration window. This
   is not a @{B}YAM@{UB} bug, please read the section about the @{B}XPK@{UB} libraries below.

@{I}The most frequently asked question@{UI}

This was already explained in the last newsletter, but I'm still getting about 4
complaints per week concerning the width of the toolbars...

The problem is that the toolbar doesn't fit in the window, the rightmost buttons
can't be accessed. Some users think that the graphics are too large, but in fact
the button labels are eating so much space. If you're using topaz/8 as the label
font,  then  some  of  the  buttons become invisible on a 640 pixel wide screen.
Solution:  select  'Settings/MUI'  and  go to the 'Toolbar' section. Now you can
either  choose  a thinner font (helvetica/9 works well) or switch off the labels
completely ('image only' mode).

@{I}Again: @{B}XPK@{UB} libraries@{UI}

As  mentioned in the first newsletter, the @{B}XPK@{UB} system (a collection of libraries
used  to  compress  and encrypt files), releases 4.31 and 4.33 contain bugs that
lead to a crash in the 'Misc' section of the configuration window.

Since  several  weeks,  the  bug-fixed release 4.34 of @{B}XPK@{UB} is available. The @{B}XPK@{UB}
system can be found on @{B}Aminet@{UB}: util/pack/xpk_User.lha

@{I}Creating your own toolbars@{UI}

The  toolbar  graphics  in @{B}YAM 2@{UB} can be customized. The images are stored in the
following files:
    icons/Main.toolbar           Main window toolbar
    icons/Read.toolbar           Read window toolbar
    icons/Write.toolbar          Write window toolbar
    icons/Address.toolbar        Address book toolbar

These files are optional:
    icons/Main_G.toolbar         Ghosted main window toolbar
    icons/Main_S.toolbar         Selected main window toolbar
    icons/Read_G.toolbar         Ghosted read window toolbar
    icons/Read_S.toolbar         Selected read window toolbar
    icons/Write_G.toolbar        Ghosted write window toolbar
    icons/Write_S.toolbar        Selected write window toolbar
    icons/Address_G.toolbar      Ghosted address book toolbar
    icons/Address_S.toolbar      Selected address book toolbar

The  image  can  be anything that is supported by datatypes. It must be saved in
the  correct  size which depends on the size of the icons. If you have six icons
of  width  x  then the image should be 6*x+5. The extra five pixels are used for
vertical  lines  between  the  icons  that should help you organizing the icons.
Another example: The main window toolbar has 14 buttons, each of them is a 24*18
pixel  image.  The width of the resulting toolbar image is 14*24+13 = 349 pixels
and the height is 18 pixels.

@node not04 "ALIVE MEDIASOFT NEWS"

@{B}ALIVE MEDIASOFT@{UB} NEWS
--------------------

We  have  had  a  very  busy  couple  of  months recently and thought you may be
interested  in  hearing  what we have been doing and what our plans for the next
few months are...

Our  main  objective  at the moment is releasing more good quality games. We are
happy  to  say  that  the  release  of the @{B}Quake@{UB} add-ons for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} have been
received  very well. @{B}Xmen@{UB} and @{B}Aftershock@{UB} which we have made readily available to
the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  market  are  currently  amongst  out  top sellers as is the immensly
popular   @{B}Descent@{UB}.  We  are  continuing  to  source  more  quality  add-ons  and
conversions.

The  re-release  of  @{B}Blade@{UB}  in  the  new  improved  CD  version  is  making very
satisfactory  progress.  Since  the  announcements  of @{B}Samba World Cup@{UB} and @{B}Putty
Squad@{UB}  we have struggled to keep up with the demand. Although hard-work, we find
this  very  encouraging. We also have a nice little over-head shoot'em up in the
makings which will probably see release this side of xmas.

As  well  as  publishing brand new games, there are so many games that were made
for  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  but  never saw the light of day. We aim to pick out the best of
these  and  release  them through @{B}Alive mediasoft@{UB}. We are in talks about several
titles as we speak. 2 of these we can confirm as @{B}Cedric@{UB} and @{B}Whales Voyage 2@{UB}.

* @{B}CEDRIC@{UB}

   This is a wonderfully addictive platform game with a little dash of something
   more.  As  well as the favourite "run about and jump on their heads" style of
   play  there is an underlying, larger plot involving problem solving and clues
   which all add up to make up a truly playable game.

* @{B}WHALES VOYAGE 2@{UB}

   The  sequal  to the immensly popular @{B}Whales Voyage@{UB}. This time you are a space
   explorer  travelling  across  the  galaxies, trading with other life forms as
   well as fighting to defend yourself when the need arrises.

   As  well as an intriguing plot and a stategic method of play, @{B}Whales Voyage 2@{UB}
   turns  into  a @{B}Doom@{UB} type game when you reach the surface of a planet. You can
   walk  around  the  planet  in  full  motion  and use of your limbs, so if you
   experience a bad trade for example you can pulverise your enemy!

Neither @{B}Cedric@{UB} or @{B}Whales Voyage 2@{UB} have ever been released in the UK. A full news
bulletin  will  be  sent  out  shortly  for  each game. In the mean-time we have
attatched some screen shots to wet your appetite!

Below you will find a list of our games that we either publish or distribute:
 * @{B}Blade@{UB} CD edition
 * @{B}Xmen@{UB} for @{B}Quake@{UB}
 * @{B}Aftershock@{UB} for @{B}Quake@{UB}
 * @{B}Mission Pack 1 & 2@{UB} for @{B}Quake@{UB}

@{B}AMIGA@{UB} ADQUIRED LICENSE TO UPGRADE @{B}CDTV@{UB} TO @{B}OS 2.0+@{UB}
----------------------------------------------------------

@{B}Amiga  of  Minnesota Interest Group Alliance@{UB} is pleased to announce that we have
aquired  a  license  to  produce  and  distribute  in  a NON-Commercial way, the
technology to upgrade the @{B}CDTV@{UB} to @{B}OS 2.0+@{UB}.

We  are  currrently testing with @{B}OS 3.1@{UB}, and are seeking responce from potential
purchaser's  of  the  product. It will consist of 2 - proms which install in the
@{B}CDTV@{UB},  and  allow  the  unit  to operate with the CD Drive active, and a @{B}3.1@{UB} rom
installed.  This  license  is to us alone and cannot be transferred to any other
party.  Because it is NON-Comercial, responce of potential buyers will determine
the price, as how many proms we purchase determine the price.

We  have  determined  that  the  Price  will be between $15 and $30 US. The more
intersted parties the lower the price can be.

This  has  been  a  long  16 month negotiation, and could not have been possible
without  the  help  of  many  people,  @{B}CUCUG@{UB} included for the posting of the FAQ
directories some time ago.

Please direct all responce to @{I}thedoctor@wavetech.net@{UI} and a file will be built on
that.

Thank you.

@{B}MARBLE-EYES DEVELOPMENT@{UB} RELEASE A NEW ADDON FOR @{B}GENETIC SPECIES@{UB}
---------------------------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR INMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

23-Sep-1998

@{B}Marble-Eyes  Development@{UB}  is  proud  to  announce  the  release of a new @{B}Genetic
Species@{UB}  AddOn.  And  what an addon: 24 bit finally hits an @{B}Amiga@{UB} game! So we're
writing  history. In other words the @{B}Amiga@{UB} and @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} goes true colour,
that means 16777216 colours per pixel. The human eye recognizes about 14 million
colours but you'll get 2 million extra! :)

In  order to support the 24bit screenmodes in @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} we had to re-write
all the functions which access the display screen. It has been a lot of work but
looking at the result, the time has certainly paid off.

The  improvement  is  simply  amazing. Not a single pixel is rendered in @{B}Genetic
Species@{UB}  without putting it through an alpha channel - and the result will blast
you away!

@{B}SOFTWARE HUT@{UB} TO DISTRIBUTE THE @{B}IOBLIX@{UB}
-------------------------------------

@{I}FOR INMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Hello,

As  many  of  you  know  there  has been no high speed @{B}Zorro II@{UB} serial board for
@{B}Amiga@{UB}.  The  @{B}I/O  Extender@{UB}  is  still  not  available but we have imported a new
product from @{B}RBM@{UB} in Germany. It is the @{B}IOBlix@{UB}.

It  supplies  four  serial-  and two EPP/ECP-parallel-ports. In addition to that
there  are  two  module  ports  to  install an @{B}AHI@{UB}-compatible sound-module and a
SANAII-compatible  Ethernet-module which are being developed. Another module for
1.44MB-disc-drives is planned.

The   serial   highspeed   ports   provide   64   Byte   of   FIFO-memory,   the
EPP/ECP-parallel-ports  have  a 16 Byte FIFO which qualifies the @{B}IOBlix@{UB} for high
demands  (e.g.  mailboxes). Besides the internal FIFO the @{B}IOBlix@{UB} can be upgraded
to up to 8KByte of external FIFO-memory which can be related to each module.

The  parallel-ports  support  the  uni- and bidirectional modes to be compatible
with  all  printers. Scanner-drivers (in combination with @{B}ScanQuix4@{UB}) and drivers
for   backup-devices   (such   as  @{B}ZIP@{UB}-drives/streamers)  are  planned  for  the
EPP/ECP-mode.

The  @{B}IOBlix@{UB}  is  designed  as  a  @{B}ZorroII@{UB}-Slot-card so it is compatible with all
@{B}Amiga2@{UB}/@{B}3@{UB}/@{B}4000@{UB} and @{B}Amiga1200@{UB} systems with @{B}Zorro@{UB}-Expansion.

Transfer rate: 460 KBaud, theor. 1.5 MBaud

We  are  taking  preorders.  The first 75 are due in stock on Tuesday next week.
Preorders are advised as the first batch will be sold out by the time it is in.

Our special introductory price is $139.95 (After Sept 30 the price is $149.95)

To order call 1-800-932-6442 or email us at @{I}softhut@erols.com@{UI}. Thank you.

@{B}BLITTERSOFT@{UB} AND @{B}WEIRD SCIENCE@{UB} TO RELEASE @{B}CERBERUS@{UB}
-------------------------------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact: @{I}sales@blittersoft.com@{UI} and @{I}sales@weird-science.co.uk@{UI}

September  24th,  1998 - @{B}Blittersoft@{UB} and @{B}Weird Science@{UB} have announced today that
they are to release a new machine, @{B}Cerberus@{UB}.

@{B}Cerberus@{UB}  is  a  totally  integrated  Multimedia Home Entertainment System. Both
companies  see  @{B}Cerberus@{UB}  primarily  as a means to provide access to the new DVD
Technology, whilst maintaining a high degree of backwards compatibility with the
existing @{B}Amiga@{UB} software collection.

@{B}Cerberus@{UB} is capable of running all of the latest software with provision for the
new  digital  convergence  technology.  It  provides  a high degree of backwards
compatibility with existing @{B}Amiga@{UB} and @{B}Mac@{UB} software.

The  system  is industry standard PC based, providing access to a wealth of both
serious  and  leisure  software  already  available  and  the  steady  stream of
fantastic new software constantly flowing.

This  Integrated  Multimedia system uses the @{B}Mpact 2@{UB} Multimedia Processor as the
core  element  of the motherboard, providing it's wealth of features without any
add-on  cards.  @{B}Cerberus@{UB}  is  capable  of providing a high standard of 2D and 3D
Graphics, Sound, General Midi, and DVD.

The  Integrated  DVD  drive and hardware accelerated Mpeg 2 decoding provides an
industry  leading  quality  of  DVD  ouput to both the monitor and TV output. In
addition, @{B}Cerberus@{UB} provides Dolby Digital AC3 output for surround sound systems.
These  features  enable  @{B}Cerberus@{UB}  to  become an integral part of a Home Theatre
set-up.

@{B}Cerberus@{UB} has the ability to run most @{B}Amiga@{UB} and @{B}Macintosh@{UB} software with the built
in  'software'  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  and optional 'software' @{B}Macintosh@{UB}. @{B}Picasso 96@{UB} Software is
provided  as  standard  on  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB} side for an RTG Graphics @{B}Amiga@{UB} capable of
making  the most of the @{B}Cerberus@{UB} 2D Graphics engine. An optional @{B}040@{UB} / @{B}060@{UB} based
@{B}Amiga@{UB}-on-a-card will be available in the future.

@{B}Cerberus@{UB}  has  full  Internet support with a fast 56k modem and all the software
required to connect, browse and exchange emails.

Experience the devastingly high quality of digital video, play the latest games,
revel  in  the  power  of some of the best serious applications in the world and
marvel  at  the  compatibility  of  @{B}Cerberus@{UB}  with  your existing @{B}Amiga@{UB} software
collection.

The Future Has Arrived.

@node not09 "CLAWS OF THE DEVIL: THE FIRST COMMERCIAL GAME FOR PPC?"

@{B}CLAWS OF THE DEVIL@{UB}: THE FIRST COMMERCIAL GAME FOR @{B}PPC@{UB}?
------------------------------------------------------

Who  has  never  heard  anything about @{I}Lara Croft@{UI}? She's the heroine of the @{B}Tomb
Raider@{UB}  saga,  very  well  known  by  @{B}PC@{UB}  and @{B}PSX@{UB} owners. Despite the efforts of
several  people,  @{B}Eidos  Interactive@{UB} does not seem to be interested in licensing
the game to port the game to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

Obviously,  the  only solution to this problem is to release our own version. It
they  have  @{B}Tomb  Raider@{UB}, we will have @{B}Claws Of the Devil@{UB}. And if they have @{I}Lara
Croft@{UI}, we will have @{I}Teri Fletcher@{UI}.

@{B}Claws  of  the  Devil@{UB} was first announced in March, but until now we haven't any
information  about  the  game  and  the  features. Finally, @{B}Titan Computers@{UB} have
released some info about the game and some screenshots as well.

@{B}Claws of the Devil@{UB} will feature the following:
 * Objects (Monsters, Tables, Cars,...) are complex polygonal Objects
 * Objects have up to 800 polygons
 * Realistic lighting with shadows
 * Colored  light  (Colored  light illuminates walls in this area in the defined
   color)
 * Dynamic lights (Firballs and flares in your hand will illuminate the walls)
 * Transparency textures (water is in @{B}Claws of the Devil@{UB} transparent)
 * Fogging (damp fog makes creepy atmosphere)
 * Camera movement is totally free.
 * Heroine is followed by camera (Third person perspective)
 * Smooth animation of monsters and heroine
 * Heroine can walk, run, jump, swim, dive, climb,...
 * 13 very big Levels
 * @{B}Claws of the Devil@{UB} has more than 24 different enemies
 * Many different new weapons
 * More than 20 min. Video
 * ...

@{B}Claws  of  the  Devil@{UB}  will  work  fine  on a @{B}Amiga@{UB} with @{B}060@{UB}/50, 32MB of Ram and
Gfxcard.  Perhaps,  it  will  support  @{B}AGA@{UB},  but  the  authors  want  to make an
impressive game and not like a @{B}Wolfenstein@{UB} clone.

However,  it  will look great on a @{B}Amiga@{UB} with @{B}060@{UB}/50 and @{B}PPC 604@{UB}/200Mhz, 32MB of
Ram  and  @{B}CyberVisionPPC@{UB}.  It  could be the first commercial game to support the
stunning features of the @{B}Permedia@{UB}'s 3D chip, as the coding is in progress...

Although,  there is not any release date yet, it could be ready for the upcoming
@{B}Computer '98@{UB} in Koeln (Germany), in November.

@{B}ACTIVE TECHNOLOGIES@{UB} CREATE VARIOUS ISDN PACKAGES
------------------------------------------------

UK  Internet  users  are  most  likely  aware  of  the  recent  launch  of  @{B}BT@{UB}'s
'@{B}HomeHighway@{UB}', which is a lower cost ISDN service for the home user. For further
information point your browser to @{B}www.homehighway.bt.com/@{UB}.

@{B}Amiga@{UB} users can take advantage of ISDN, despite the fact that @{B}BT@{UB} claim you 'need
a @{B}PC@{UB} to use @{B}HomeHighway@{UB}'. @{B}Active Technologies@{UB} have created various ISDN packages
that will connect your @{B}Amiga@{UB} quickly and cheaply:
    ID01 External ISDN Terminal Adapter           £129.95
    ID02 ISDN TA & @{B}NetConnect v2@{UB}                  £159.95
    ID03 ISDN TA & @{B}NetConnect v2@{UB} & @{B}Hypercom 1@{UB}     £189.95
    ID04 ISDN TA & @{B}NetConnect v2@{UB} & @{B}IOBlix@{UB}         £229.95

The  external  ISDN TA is the @{B}Dynalink@{UB} '@{B}MagicXpress@{UB}'. Further information can be
obtained  from  @{B}www.askey.com.tw/@{UB}.  @{B}NetConnect  v2@{UB}  is available on CD or floppy
disk. Information about the @{B}Hypercom@{UB} or @{B}IOBlix@{UB} serial cards can be obtained from
@{B}www.active-net.co.uk/@{UB}.

What advantages does ISDN offer over normal PSTN analogue lines?

 * @{I}Higher  bandwidth@{UI}  - download at true 64K or 128K (by using both ISDN lines),
   without  connection  variations  (ie. 56K modems often connect at 44K or even
   resync down to slower speeds after the initial connection). ISDN is constant.
   No fluctuations in the connection quality.
 * @{I}Upload  at  64K or 128K@{UI} - the difference between a 33.6/56K modem is that you
   can only upload at 33.6K. With ISDN you can upload at 64K or 128K (using both
   channels).
 * @{I}Instant  connection@{UI}  -  with  ISDN,  connection  to the Internet is under one
   second,  whereas  with  normal  analogue  modems, this can be anything around
   20-30 seconds.

If  you  would  like further information about @{B}BT HomeHighway@{UB}, our ISDN packs or

@{B}AMIRC 2.1@{UB} IS NOW AVAILABLE
--------------------------

The eight public release of @{B}AmIRC@{UB}, version 2.1, is now available!

@{B}AmIRC@{UB}  is  a  client  for the IRC Internet Relay Chat protocol written by @{I}Oliver
Wagner@{UI}, also the author of @{B}VoyagerNG@{UB} and @{B}Microdot II@{UB}. It is *SHAREWARE*. You can
register  it  easily  with the included @{B}VaporWare@{UB} registration utility at any of
our registration sites around the world.

Although  @{B}AmIRC  2.1@{UB}  contains  numerous more hours of work and thus is slightly
more expensive than @{B}AmIRC 1.x@{UB}, there is *NO UPGRADE FEE* -- your legal @{B}AmIRC 1.x@{UB}
and  @{B}AmIRC  2.0@{UB}  keyfile  will  continue to work. The free upgrade is our "Thank
you!"  to  all  the  people  who  already registered @{B}AmIRC 1.x@{UB}, instead of using
cracked versions, pirated key files or "evaluation periods" of several months or
even  years. Registrations at the @{B}AmIRC 1.x@{UB} price are *no longer accepted* as of
the 2.0 release.

Where to download it:

FTP:
 * @{B}ftp.vapor.com@{UB},    pub/amirc/
 * @{B}ftp.us.vapor.com@{UB}, pub/amirc/
 * @{B}ftp.de.vapor.com@{UB}, pub/amirc/
 * @{B}ftp.au.vapor.com@{UB}, pub/amirc/
 * @{B}ftp.pl.vapor.com@{UB}, pub/vapor/amirc/
 * @{B}AmiNet@{UB}, comm/irc (soon)

 * amirc_21.lzx, 852086 Bytes
 * amirc_21.lha, 969738 Bytes

(Note  that  @{B}ftp.us.vapor.com@{UB}  has generally the best connectivity of the listed
mirror sites)

WWW:
 * @{B}www.vapor.com/@{UB}
 * @{B}vapor.ukonline.co.uk/@{UB} (File mirror only)
 * @{B}www.meanmachine.ch/vapor/@{UB} (File mirror only)

EMail-Fileserver:
 * Mail to @{I}fileserv@vapor.com@{UI}, put "SEND AMIRC" in the body.
 * The file will be returned uuencoded.

New features since @{B}AmIRC@{UB}'s last public release (2.0) include:

 * Single  window mode. You can join several channels with opening just a single
   window.
 * Total  queueing.  Now  everything  which  isn't  urgent  (like  KICKS or MODE
   changes) is sent through the output queue to reduce risk of being kicked by a
   server due to flooding.
 * Settable  scrollback  buffer  size.  The  amount of text stored in a window's
   scrollback  buffer  is  now  limited;  the  number  of  lines  to keep can be
   configured.
 * Vapor  Update  Library.  Will  now  automagically check for available updates
   during  startup, and inform you if there is one - which you can automatically
   download, too.
 * New plugin API calls. On request by plugin authors, several new callbacks and
   functions have been implemented in the @{B}AmIRC@{UB} plugin API.
 * Multiselect ban list window
 * openurl.library support
 * new translations done by @{B}ATO@{UB} (@{B}ato.vapor.com/ato@{UB})
 * several  bug  fixes and minor improvements (for a complete list, refer to the
   history attached below)

New features since the 1.69 release include:
 * Query  and  channel  windows  can  now  be iconified individually to a "tray"
   window.  Tray  window button labels turn bold when new messages are received,
   white  when  a  highlight  occurs,  and carry information about the number of
   messages in each window.
 * New  low-level  Plugin  API.  Documentation  of  the  API  is  available from
   @{B}www.vapor.com@{UB}   or   @{B}Aminet@{UB},  in  a  separate  archive.  An  example  plugin,
   @{B}WallChop.AmiPlug@{UB}, is included.
 * Server list is now a ListTree object with subgroups for different networks.
 * Can  now  use  MIMEPrefs to automatically view & save files received via DCC.
   Activate  the  "Use  MIMEPrefs  to  view?"  or  "Use MIMEPrefs to save?" menu
   options.
 * "Lag-O-Meter"  (tm  ;))  probes the IRC server every 30 seconds and shows the
   current  lag  from  0-10+ in a gauge below the userlist. The Info window also
   contains the three most recent measurements and the average.
 * Heavily  improved  logging.  All  channel  and  query windows now have an "L"
   button  to  the  right  of  the  input  gadget,  which  is a toggle button to
   activate the logging to a user-specified directory.
 * "Favorites"  window  added  to store the names of channels you use regularly.
   Click on the channel name in a window to open.
 * @{B}AmIRC@{UB}  now  uses @{B}NList.mcc@{UB} (if available) for its listviews. @{B}NList@{UB} is written
   by @{I}Gilles Masson@{UI} (@{I}masson@iut-soph.unice.fr@{UI}).
 * Stronger CTCP flood protection.
 * DCC connections now work with @{B}Miami@{UB}'s SOCKS support.
 * Files  received via DCC are opened in shared mode during transfer, so you can
   play  or  view  them  partially  while  the  transfer  is  still  in progress
   (especially for all you mp3 freaks out there :-)
 * DCC  receives  now  have  the  options  to  Replace a file. Both the send and
   receive  windows  have  Cleanup  buttons,  to  remove  old  closed and failed
   connections.
 * DCCs  now  show  the  estimated remaining time of a transfer based on current
   throughput.
 * Query  windows  now  have  an  N  button to change the nickname the window is
   currently bound to.
 * Background color of @{B}AmIRC@{UB}'s main listviews can now be configured.
 * /AWAY  messages  are  now  filtered,  and  only  shown  once  to avoid screen
   cluttering when talking to someone who is set /AWAY.
 * special "Invite" and "Oper" requesters
 * Can now automatically accept DCC Send requests.
 * Now  sends  pertinent  information  to query windows, such as /nick and /QUIT
   messages from that user, as well as CTCP and DCC messages.

@node not20 "OS3.5 GETS APPROVAL"

@{B}OS3.5@{UB} GETS APPROVAL
-------------------

Reported to me by @{B}Team AMIGA@{UB} members at @{B}MAE@{UB} (Columbus, Ohio)

It  is  official!!! @{B}Amiga Inc,@{UB} announces @{B}OS3.5@{UB} with @{B}P5 PPC@{UB} board support will be
done  by  the first half of '99! It was not announced however, whether the @{B}OS3.5@{UB}
upgrade will use the @{B}P5@{UB} or @{B}H&P PPC@{UB} software.

Developed  in combination with a lot of @{B}Amiga@{UB} developers, @{B}OS3.5@{UB} Upgrade will use
the  current  @{B}3.1@{UB}  roms  and  will  be  a  CD ONLY release! There will be no @{B}PPC@{UB}
version,  however  @{B}PPC@{UB}  support  will  be  included  using  either @{B}P5@{UB} or @{B}H&P PPC@{UB}
software, as stated above.

Highlights concerning the @{B}OS3.5@{UB} upgrade:
 * RTG Support
 * RTA Support
 * CDFS Support
 * New Interface
Plus bug fixes and updates to several areas of the OS

Purposes  of  the @{B}OS3.5@{UB} upgrade is to support all the advanced hardware/software
that is on the Classic @{B}Amiga@{UB} market and to allow developers to code for a higher
spec  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  Classic.  This  will open the door for more and better software and
hardware for the Classic @{B}Amiga@{UB} while giving developers more transition time into
the NG @{B}Amiga@{UB}!

There  will  also be a full Classic @{B}OS3.5@{UB} emulator shipping with the NG OS so we
can  all  start  buying  software  again secure in the knowledge that it will be
supported and runnable with the NG @{B}Amiga@{UB}!

This @{B}3.5OS@{UB} upgrade and the promise of full emulation in the NG @{B}Amiga@{UB} will smooth
the transition for all @{B}Amiga@{UB} users to the NG @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

In  the next week or so, a website will go up especially for @{B}OS3.5@{UB} and @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}
will begin releasing information on the upgrade to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} press. More details
about @{B}OS3.5@{UB} will also be released in Cologne.

We  are  told  that  the  highlight  of the show thus far for @{I}Bill McEwen@{UI} is the
modeling  convention going on in the same hotel! 400 female wannabe's apparently
provided  fodder  for some of the oldest chat up lines in the book as @{B}Amiga@{UB} guys
attempted  to entice the young ladies into discussions about Intuition and Peeks
and Pokes.

@{I}Joe  Torre@{UI},  in his own enduring style, showed up in a giant sumo outfit and ran
around  the lot persued by security. Not to be outdone, @{I}Rick "The Canadian's Are
Coming"  Giannini@{UI}  of @{B}Asimware@{UB} flattened @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}'s @{I}Darreck Lisle@{UI} several times
without even putting on his sumo suit!

Another  grand demonstration of why the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community MUST keep one step ahead
of society (and the law!).

@{B}REBOL/CORE V1.0@{UB} HAS BEEN FINALLY RELEASED
-----------------------------------------

@{I}Cuts  Application  Solution Lengths from Thousands of Lines of Code to Hundreds;
The "Language of the Free" Now Available for Download@{UI}

UKIAH,    Calif.--(BUSINESS    WIRE)--Oct.    1,   1998--   @{B}REBOL   Technologies@{UB}
(@{B}www.rebol.com@{UB})  today  announced  the  release  of  @{B}REBOL/Core  V1.0@{UB}, a network
messaging  language designed to revolutionize the exchange and interpretation of
information on the Internet.

@{B}REBOL@{UB}  (pronounced  "REB-ul")  represents  a  powerful  new  domain  of computer
languages  *  described  as  context-sensitive  by computer scientists. By their
nature,  languages  in this domain are more robust, simple, and elegant than @{B}C++@{UB}
and  @{B}Java@{UB},  and  also  more customizable and easier-to-understand than scripting
languages like @{B}PERL@{UB} and @{B}Tcl@{UB}.

@{B}REBOL/Core@{UB}  is  100% platform- and operating system-independent, free of charge,
and  immediately  available  for  download  at @{B}www.rebol.com@{UB}. This first release
provides  support  for  the  @{B}AmigaOS@{UB},  @{B}BSD@{UB},  @{B}Linux  x86@{UB}  (@{B}Red  Hat@{UB},  @{B}Debian@{UB}, and
@{B}Slackware@{UB}), @{B}Macintosh@{UB}, @{B}Solaris 2.6 SPARC@{UB}, and @{B}Windows 95@{UB}/@{B}98@{UB}/@{B}NT@{UB} platforms.

@{B}REBOL@{UB}  challenges the common belief that software and development languages must
be  complex  in  order  to be productive. It is the product of founder, CEO, and
@{B}AmigaOS@{UB}  creator  @{I}Carl  Sassenrath@{UI}'s twenty years of research and development on
the requirements for an ideal computer language.

@{B}REBOL@{UB}  improves  productivity  because  it  is easy-to-learn, easy-to-customize,
elegant,  and  robust. By harnessing the powerful capabilities of human-language
expression  inherent  in  context-sensitive  languages, @{B}REBOL@{UB} breaks through the
barriers of computing complexity.

The  result:  @{B}REBOL@{UB} cuts application solution lengths from thousands of lines of
code  to  hundreds.  In  fact,  @{B}REBOL/Core@{UB}  is only 250 kilobytes in size, so it
downloads in seconds, even on a 56Kbps modem.

@{I}Sassenrath@{UI}  asserts, @{I}"Developers and the technologists have been shortchanged by
existing  languages  and  trapped  in  a  quagmire of unproductive, bureaucratic
complexity."@{UI}

@{I}"All  other  programming and scripting languages are computer-centric languages.
@{B}REBOL@{UB},  on the other hand, is human-centric. The introduction of @{B}REBOL@{UB} heralds a
new era in which people control their computers, not the other way around."@{UI}

@{I}@{B}REBOL@{UB} Increases the Productivity of Individuals and Corporations Alike@{UI}

@{B}REBOL@{UB}  has the power to increase productivity not only for individuals, but also
for  enterprise  application developers and Internet technologists. @{I}Rick Snyder@{UI},
president  of @{B}Avalon Investments@{UB}, explains, @{I}"When I was the president of @{B}Gateway
2000@{UB},  I saw firsthand how the complexity of building network-based applications
seriously challenged both developers and corporations."@{UI}

@{I}"That's  why  we  made  @{B}REBOL  Technologies@{UB}  one of @{B}Avalon@{UB}'s first major venture
capital  investments. The @{B}REBOL@{UB} language provides a revolutionary, simple way to
model  the exchange and flow of information in today's multifaceted, distributed
environments.  @{B}REBOL@{UB}  truly  speaks the language of the Internet, of developers,
and of enterprise-wide communications."@{UI}

@{B}REBOL@{UB}  is  an  Internet-native  language,  directly  handling  primary  Internet
protocols  such  as  e-mail,  Web  and FTP. No other bundled network or computer
applications  are  needed, although @{B}REBOL@{UB}'s open, customizable design means they
can all be accommodated.

Typical  @{B}REBOL@{UB}  applications  might  include  Web site building and maintenance,
electronic  commerce,  file  transfer,  list  management,  newsgroup processing,
E-mail filtering and processing, and Web searches.

With  the releases of alpha and beta versions of @{B}REBOL@{UB} over the past ten months,
the  language  has  attracted  a  grassroots alliance of network administrators,
educators,  Webmasters  and  computer  enthusiasts.  @{B}REBOL  Technologies@{UB} will be
encouraging  the  development  of  third-party  applications  built  on the @{B}Core@{UB}
product.

Many of these will be available directly through @{B}REBOL Technologies@{UB}' web site at
no  charge.  The company will also produce commercial and professional upgrades,
as  well  as  distribution  licenses,  over  the  next few months. These will be
accompanied  by  releases  of  @{B}REBOL/Core@{UB}  on @{B}Linux@{UB} for @{B}SPARC@{UB} and @{B}DEC Alpha@{UB}, @{B}DEC
Alpha NT@{UB}, @{B}IRIX 6.2@{UB}, @{B}BeOS x86@{UB}, and @{B}BSDi@{UB}.

@{I}A Language Grounded in Theory and Practice@{UI}

@{B}REBOL@{UB}  is  an  acronym  for @{B}Relative Expression-Based Object Language@{UB}. While the
ideas  behind  it have evolved over a period of twenty years, the @{B}REBOL@{UB} language
is itself the product of two years of specification, development, and testing.

Led  by @{I}Carl Sassenrath@{UI}, his team of language and network architects built @{B}REBOL@{UB}
by drawing on their decades of experience in both academic theory and real-world
practicality.  The  result  is  a language that @{B}REBOL Technologies@{UB} believes will
appeal equally to theoreticians and to Internet technologists.

Prior  to founding @{B}REBOL Technologies@{UB}, @{I}Carl Sassenrath@{UI}'s professional experience
spanned  eighteen  years  in  operating  systems, computer languages, multimedia
systems,  and  management.  While a manager at @{B}Commodore Amiga@{UB} in the mid-1980s,
Mr.  @{I}Sassenrath@{UI}  led the design and implementation of the highly acclaimed @{B}Amiga@{UB}
multitasking operating system.

As  the  president of @{B}Pantaray, Inc.@{UB} in the early 90s, he headed the development
of  several  multimedia  software  products, including television set-top boxes,
CD-ROM  based  computers,  programming languages, content authoring systems, and
digital  video  tools.  His  background also includes management and engineering
positions at @{B}Apple Computer@{UB} and @{B}Hewlett-Packard@{UB}.

@{I}About @{B}REBOL Technologies@{UB}@{UI}

@{B}REBOL  Technologies@{UB}  was incorporated by @{I}Carl Sassenrath@{UI} in March 1998. Based in
Ukiah,  Calif.,  the  company  develops, markets, licenses and supports @{B}REBOL@{UB}, a
network  messaging  language that represents an entirely new class of languages,
with  capabilities  well beyond those of anachronistic programming and scripting
languages.

@{B}REBOL@{UB}'s mission is to usher in a new era of productivity through the development
and  distribution  of  a  paradigm-shattering  language  that reintroduces human
factors  and  customizability  into  application  development and computing. The
latest   version  of  @{B}REBOL/Core@{UB}  is  always  available  for  free  download  at

@{B}ICOA@{UB} ANNOUNCES CHANGES AND GOALS
--------------------------------

@{B}INDUSTRY COUNCIL OPEN AMIGA@{UB} ANNOUNCEMENT

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI} - @{B}Midwest Amiga Exposition@{UB}, October 1998

By the @{B}ICOA@{UB} steering committee
   @{I}Kermit Woodall@{UI} - Commercial seat
   @{I}Wolf Dietrich@{UI} - Commercial seat
   @{I}Olaf Barthel@{UI} - Individual seat
   @{I}Petter Nilsen@{UI} - Open seat
   @{I}Harv Laser@{UI} - User representative
   @{I}Fleecy Moss@{UI} - @{B}Amiga, Inc.@{UB} representative

The  @{B}ICOA@{UB} (@{B}Industry Council Open Amiga@{UB}) steering committee has chosen to refocus
the  @{B}ICOA@{UB}. While the @{B}ICOA@{UB} has always been about developers serving developers, a
clear  and  understandable  focus  was  needed.  The @{B}ICOA@{UB} steering committee has
decided  on  a  course  that will reorganize itself into a professional society.
Much  like  a  user  group  serves  its  members,  the  @{B}ICOA@{UB}  will  now focus on
communications, resources, and issues relevant to developers.

Towards  this the first step of many will be to establish the permanent @{B}ICOA@{UB} web
site.  The current site was designed as an intermediate step during a process of
creating  the @{B}ICOA@{UB} and hosting elections. The new site will be a resource to all
developers,  whether  they choose to join @{B}ICOA@{UB} or not. The web site will feature
information  specific  to  the  @{B}ICOA@{UB}  such  as  its  mailing lists, software and
hardware development information and FAQs, production and marketing information,
and  other  news  and  information that touches on all aspects of developing and
publishing  a  product for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} platform. A special feature in the works is
an piracy reporting mechanism that maintains anonymity.

The  web  site  is located at  @{B}www.amiga.net@{UB} and will be initially active in the
first  weeks  of  October  1998. The site is designed to grow and is being built
under  the  direction  of  the  steering  committee  with the active work of @{I}Ted
Wallingford@{UI} and @{I}Gary Peake@{UI}.

Future  plans  for  the  @{B}ICOA@{UB}  will  depend highly on developer support. Regular
developer  classes  and  seminars  are  already being hosted at nearly all @{B}Amiga@{UB}
shows  under the coordination of @{I}Steve Shireman@{UI} and @{I}Kermit Woodall@{UI} for the @{B}ICOA@{UB}.
Coordination  of  these  seminars  will become a regular offering of the @{B}ICOA@{UB} to
@{B}Amiga@{UB} trade shows that have the space and desire to host them.

Pending  @{B}Amiga,  Inc.@{UB}  participation,  the  @{B}ICOA@{UB}  plans  to  release a quarterly
newsletter  and  CDROM.  The focus of the newsletter will be more than technical
issues, it will include issues relating to running a business, producing artwork
and advertising for a product and more. The CDROM will include a wide variety of
contents  that  should  include  everything from code collections to catalogs of
advertising and promotional products to help companies grow.

Like a user group, members of the @{B}ICOA@{UB} will get out of it what they put into it.
Phrased  in computer terms this will mean, 'garbage in = garbage out'. Right now
with what's going into the web site and what we've seen of the @{B}ICOA@{UB} seminars, we
can say we're getting caviar - let's keep that direction as we move forward!

The  @{B}ICOA@{UB}  is a professional society by and for developers. For more information
see @{B}www.amiga.net@{UB}

@node not23 "FUTURE SHOCK 2 IS NOW AVAILABLE WITH A NEW PRICE"

@{B}FUTURE SHOCK 2@{UB} IS NOW AVAILABLE WITH A NEW PRICE
------------------------------------------------

This musical CD was created entirely on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} computer. It is currently on a
second edition and available only from @{B}Sidewinder Productions@{UB}.

The  artist,  Texas  based  @{I}Sidewinder@{UI}  had  been  creating  mods  for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community for years. You've probably heard his mods and downloaded them from his
own directory on @{B}Aminet@{UB}.

@{B}FUTURE  SHOCK  2@{UB}  has  been  featured in rave reviews by magazines like @{B}CUAmiga@{UB},
@{B}Amiga Computing@{UB}, and @{B}Amiga Report@{UB} as well as many more over the last 4 years.

This CD features 74 minutes of electronic dance and synthesizer music, mixed and
recorded entirely on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} computer and recorded in a professional studio in
San  Antonio,  Texas.  It  was  the  first %100 @{B}Amiga@{UB} recorded and produced in a
proffesional  Studio  during  the  summer  winter of 1993. Also Features a bonus
track  from  the  popular  game  "@{B}Scorched  Tanks@{UB}"  remixed  in CD quality. With
striking  cover art created by well known 3d gfx artist @{I}Zak Jarvis@{UI}, this CD will
hopefully please @{B}Amiga@{UB} and @{I}Sidewinder@{UI} music fans for years to come.

Dealers interested in selling this CD to the public we offer special pricing in:
         5-10 CDs     $8 each CD
         25+ CDs      $7 each CD

The new reedition retail price is $10 US

@{B}DIGITAL IMAGES@{UB} UPDATE
---------------------

This is a note of @{B}Digital Images@{UB} requiring for help for their upcoming games.
         ----------------------------------------

Hello,

We have a bit of a weird request here:

For @{B}Space Station 3000@{UB}, it will include many different characters, each one with
their own personality. When you employ a crew member, some stats will be brought
up about that person as well as a photo of themselves.

So,  we  need  some  photo's  of you!!! You can send the pictures of yourself by
e-mail to: @{I}stuart@digital-images.demon.co.uk@{UI}

I  would  appreciate  it  if  all pictures were compressed using Lha or Lzx. Any
major  picture  format  at  any  resoloution  will  be fine. (We will scale them
ourselves).

If  you don't have a scanner or a Digital camera, then you can send your photo's
by post to: @{I}Stuart Walker@{UI}
     @{B}Digital Images@{UB}
     The School House
     Motcombe
     Shaftesbury
     Dorset
     SP7 9NT
     UK

All the people who send picture will be included in the credits.

Thank you for your help.
         ----------------------------------------

@{I}News Update@{UI}

Talks  are  still  going  with  @{B}Psygnosis@{UB}  with  regards to @{B}Wipeout 2097@{UB}. We are
confident  that  we will get the necessary licencing to port @{B}Wipeout 2097@{UB} to the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}. Watch this space for the latest info.

We  are  about to start writing a @{B}Syndicate@{UB} style game. However, we still need a
few  coders  and  graphics artists to achieve this. The coders should be able to
write an isometric graphics engine similar to that on @{B}Syndicate@{UB} using a language
such  as  @{B}C@{UB}  or  @{B}C++@{UB}. The graphics artists should be able to draw and model high
quality objects to be included in this game. All examples of work should be sent
to: @{I}Stuart@digital-images.demon.co.uk@{UI}

We  would  like  an example of an isometric graphics engine from the coders, and
some examples of the required graphics from the graphic artists.

Best Regards

@{I}Stuart Walker@{UI}

@node not28 "VAPORWARE LAUNCHES THREE NEW SOFTWARE TITLES"

@{B}VAPORWARE@{UB} LAUNCHES THREE NEW SOFTWARE TITLES
--------------------------------------------

@{B}Vapor@{UB}  have  been busy during the last few months expanding the range to include
two  new,  high  quality  @{B}Amiga@{UB} software products: @{B}X-Arc@{UB} and the @{B}Contact Manager@{UB}
(@{B}Contact  Manager@{UB}  and  @{B}X-Arc@{UB} can also be found within @{B}NetConnect v2@{UB}). Since the
recent  release  of  @{B}AmIRC v2.1@{UB} these products can be purchased via latest @{B}Vapor@{UB}
registration tool, and soon via the online order form.

Recently  included  within  the @{B}Vapor@{UB} range is the release of @{B}Scalos v1.1@{UB}. @{B}Amiga@{UB}
users   can  now  purchase  @{B}Scalos@{UB}  keyfiles  via  the  existing  @{B}Vapor@{UB}  channel
(registration tool or via the online registration form).

@{B}X-Arc@{UB}

@{B}X-Arc@{UB}  is  a new tool created for managing archives on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} computer. @{B}X-Arc@{UB}
is  very  similar  to  the  famous @{B}WinZip&reg;@{UB} and @{B}Stuff-it&reg;@{UB} for @{B}Windows@{UB} and
@{B}Macintosh@{UB} systems.

 * Thanks  to an intuitive and highly configurable interface, it offers the user
   an  easy  way  to  manage  the contents of an archive, by adding, extracting,
   renaming, showing and deleting files and directories.
 * @{B}X-Arc@{UB}  is targetted to both beginners and to expert users: it can immediately
   be utilised by everyone, but it offers numerous advanced features and options
   for  those  who  like to have every single element of the program under their
   control.
 * @{B}X-Arc@{UB} is modular: to read different types of archives it uses "plugins". This
   provides  the  user  with a common interface for every format, and offers the
   possibilty  to  add  further modules at a later date, making the program more
   and  more  powerful.  At present, the modules included with @{B}X-Arc v1.2@{UB} handle
   LHA,  LZX  and  ZIP  files,  but  other  modules  are under development (TGZ,
   UUEncode, ...) and will be included in future versions of @{B}X-Arc@{UB}.
 * @{B}X-Arc@{UB}  is able to link itself automatically to @{B}Scalos@{UB}, allowing advanced drag
   &  drop options from/to workbench, making the extraction of files a matter of
   seconds.
 * @{B}X-Arc@{UB}  has  been  translated  into  various  languages. It also includes HTML
   documentation  which  can  be  read  internally within the program, or via an
   Internet browser, that includes pictures to explain every single function.
 * @{B}X-Arc@{UB}  is  being distributed by @{B}VaporWare@{UB}, and it is able to interface itself
   with  all  the  programs  of  the  @{B}VaporWare@{UB}  suite  (@{B}Voyager@{UB},  @{B}AmFTP@{UB}, @{B}AmIRC@{UB},
   @{B}MimePrefs@{UB},  @{B}Scalos@{UB},  @{B}Vapor  Update System@{UB}, ...) becoming a tool very powerful
   and highly integrated into the OS.

@{B}Contact Manager@{UB}

The  @{B}Contact Manager@{UB} is a diary or system address book which allows you to store
all   your   favourite   user   information,   web  sites,  ftp  sites  and  IRC
server/channels. It is designed as a replacement to all the different bookmarks,
addressbooks  and  similar  GUI's  that  are built into the many different @{B}Amiga@{UB}
Internet and comms programs.

It   offers   a   number   of  features  not  found  in  many  of  the  internal
bookmark/addressbooks:

 * You  can  store  a  range  of different information for one user. In the user
   section,  for  instance,  you can include their address, email address, phone
   number,  fax  number,  web site, ftp site and so on. All these options can be
   utilised  by other software. @{B}Voyager@{UB} can use the web information, @{B}Microdot-II@{UB}
   can use the email address, @{B}STFax Pro@{UB} can use the fax number etc.
 * One  GUI,  many  programs.  You  can  store  all  the information you require
   within  one  interface.  No  need  to  worry about @{B}Microdot-II@{UB}'s addressbook,
   @{B}Voyager@{UB}'s bookmarks, @{B}STFax Pro@{UB}'s phonebook, @{B}AmFTP@{UB}'s server list etc.
 * Interacts  with  other software.  @{B}Microdot-II@{UB},  @{B}AmIRC@{UB},  @{B}Voyager@{UB}, @{B}AmFTP@{UB}, @{B}STFax
   Pro@{UB},  @{B}DOpus  Magellan@{UB}  and  @{B}IBrowse@{UB}  (all  available separately) will all add
   information  to  the @{B}Contact Manager@{UB} from within these programs. For example.
   find  an  email  address  when  reading a mail within @{B}Microdot-II@{UB}? Just click
   'add  to  addressbook'  and  the  email  address will be added to the @{B}Contact
   Manager@{UB}.  Some  of  these programs will use the @{B}Contact Manager@{UB} in additional
   ways.  For instance @{B}Microdot@{UB} will call the @{B}Contact Manager@{UB} when you press to:
   or cc: when writing a new message.
 * Textinput  (the  built  in  @{B}Vapor@{UB}  text  editor  that ships with @{B}Microdot-II@{UB},
   @{B}Voyager@{UB},  @{B}AmIRC@{UB}, @{B}STFax Pro@{UB} amongst others) now supports the ability to insert
   @{B}Contact  Manager@{UB}  information  into  any document. For instance, say you were
   writing  a message  with @{B}Microdot-II@{UB}, you could insert a name, email address,
   phone  number  or  any  other  @{B}Contact  Manager@{UB}  field,  directly  into  that
   document.  You  will  never  have  to  remember  a friends email address ever
   again!
 * Groups  and  sub-groups.  The @{B}Contact Manager@{UB} allows you to create groups for
   different  kinds  of users/addresses. @{B}AmFTP@{UB}, for instance, does not allow you
   to  create  groups  or sub-groups within its server list, however this can be
   achieved  via the @{B}Contact Manager@{UB}.
 * Multi-user  support.  If  you  are  using  @{B}Genesis@{UB}  as your TCP/IP stack, the
   @{B}Contact  Manager@{UB}  will support and allow multiple users within one interface.
   If  there  are  more  than one user in your house (family members), each user
   can  have  their own configurations (with password) so that their information
   remains private.
 * Plugin  links.  @{B}AmIRC@{UB}  (from @{B}v2.1@{UB}) now ships with an internal @{B}Contact Manager@{UB}
   plugin.  This  allows  you  to  add  users to the @{B}Contact Manager@{UB} from within
   @{B}AmIRC@{UB}  (based  on  the  current  userlist),  add interesting channels to your
   @{B}Contact  Manager@{UB}  channel  list  and  even  search for entries within @{B}Contact
   Manager@{UB} from within @{B}AmIRC@{UB}.

@{B}Scalos v1.1@{UB}

@{B}Scalos@{UB}  is  a  100% Workbench replacement with all functions working like the WB
ones. Some of the features include:
 * 64bit arithmetics for harddisk sizes
 * Full  multitasking,  every  window  has its own task, while loading icons any
   window function (e.g. Drag&Drop) is available
 * All   icon   imagetypes   are  supported  such  as  backfill  or  complement,
   configurable surrounding iconborder
 * Icon  datatype  system.  @{B}NewIcon@{UB} datatype included. If you have the knowledge
   and  will  to  write  a datatype for @{B}Mac@{UB} or even @{B}Windows@{UB} icons please contact
   the author.
 * Icon  dragging  is  far less flickery on graphics cards, whilst dragged icons
   are  displayed  with  their  text  and  they become transparent over anything
   where  they can be dropped. @{B}MUI@{UB}-alike transparency on low color screens. Real
   transparency if running at 15+ Bit.
 * @{B}Cybergraphics@{UB} and 24bit datatypes support.
 * Unlimited number of window patterns, configurable via tooltypes.
 * Optimised  background  patterns.  Routine  patterns  can be tiled, centred or
   even  scaled  to fit into the windows. With the use of render.library you can
   achieve full control over the dithering and pen usage of your patterns.
 * Live updating of window scrolling, even via the middle-mouse-button.
 * Drawer/folder windows can be iconified.
 * Menu preferences are fully configurable. Includes @{B}ToolsDaemon@{UB} and @{B}Parm@{UB} import
   and support for context sensitive Pop-Up-Menus.
 * Major Application interface (internal API), anything is possible from outside
 * Custom palette and pattern preferences program, no penlocker needed anymore.
 * Nearly all @{B}WB@{UB}-preferences will be used, install and uninstall is very easy.
 * Plugin system to exchange or add features
 * @{B}Scalos@{UB} enhances the @{B}Workbench@{UB} to make it more configurable: Iconborders (nice
   looking), Icontext variations (normal, shadowed, outlined), Screen title text

For  further  information about these products, please check the @{B}Vapor@{UB} web site:

@{B}HAAGE & PARTNER@{UB} RELEASE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE @{B}WARP3D@{UB} PROJECT
-----------------------------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR INMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Because  to  the enormous amount of rumors which have recently been spread about
@{B}Warp3D@{UB} and because most of them did not contain a grain of truth, the authors of
@{B}Warp3D@{UB}  have decided to provide a quick introduction to the project. The work is
still  in  progress, there will be no further information and we will not answer
any questions until a later point in time.

@{I}Project "@{B}Warp3D@{UB}"@{UI}

The  '@{B}Warp3D@{UB}'  (@{B}W3D@{UB})  project  is  a  piece of software that allows applications
access  to 3D hardware. The software comes with a driver package (similar to the
@{B}Picasso96@{UB}  graphics  driver software) that allows access to any 3D hardware that
is  available.  @{B}Warp3D@{UB} provides a well-defined interface between the application
and  the driver, implemented as a shared library. This enables every application
that  uses  the  @{B}Warp3D@{UB}-API  to  operate  on any kind of 3D hardware for which a
driver  is  available,  including 3D hardware that will only become available in
the future.

 * We intend to support every 3D hardware for the @{B}AMIGA@{UB} which means that drivers
   will  be  developed as soon as information on the respective hardware becomes
   available.
 * @{B}Warp3D@{UB} will work on both @{B}CyberGFX@{UB} and @{B}Picasso96@{UB} systems and will be available
   for  @{B}68K@{UB}-  as well as @{B}PPC@{UB}-applications. The @{B}PPC@{UB} version will also be a shared
   library and can be used by @{B}WarpUp@{UB} applications.
 * We  wish to stress that @{B}W3D@{UB} is not an @{B}OpenGL@{UB} implementation (like some rumors
   suggested). However, @{B}Warp3D@{UB} will allow @{B}OpenGL@{UB} implementations to benefit from
   the 3D hardware acceleration
 * Currently  the  @{B}OpenGL@{UB}-compatible  3D  graphics  library '@{B}StormMESA@{UB}' is being
   adapted  to  @{B}Warp3D@{UB} and will finally bring hardware-accelerated OpenGL to the
   @{B}AMIGA@{UB}.  The  @{B}StormMESA@{UB} implementations (@{B}GL@{UB}, @{B}GLU@{UB} and @{B}GLUT@{UB}) will be provided in
   the form of shared libraries.
 * The  combination  of  @{B}PPC@{UB},  3D  hardware, @{B}OpenGL@{UB} and a 3D driver package will
   enable  the  @{B}AMIGA@{UB}  to  reach  a  performance  in  three-dimensional graphics
   applications that is currently reserved for @{B}PC@{UB}s and game consoles.
 * Planned release: November 1998.

@{B}Warp3D@{UB}  will be freely available under the single condition that @{B}Warp3D@{UB} must not
be  utilized  by  software  that  was created illegally by unauthorized persons.

Over the last several months, the @{B}User Group Network@{UB} (@{B}UGN@{UB}) has been hard at work

@{B}AMIGA SURVIVOR@{UB} ANNOUNCES NEW WEBSITE AND CHANGES TO OPERATION
-------------------------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Survive!

Hello @{B}Amiga@{UB} fanatics!

Well,  @{B}Amiga Survivor@{UB} is proving more of a success than any of us could imagine.
Our  print-run  increases  every  month  and  new  subscribers  are added to our
database  daily.  Even  after  a  mere three issues! And now everyone around the
world  can  have  a  taste  of  it.  @{B}Amiga  Survivor@{UB} has recently had a complete
overhaul,     both     the     magazine,     and    it's    official    homepage
(@{B}http://www.crystal-software.com/AmigaSurvivor/survindex.html@{UB}).   Go   see   for
yourself  the new-look covers, new logos, and get information about distributors
and contents of the magazine. Since the new look and new promotions, many stores
around  the  planet  are  now stocking issues, in the US, Canada, The UK and the
rest  of  Europe. Have a look at the website to see if there's a store near you!
Or you can order online and have each issue delivered to your door!

At  one point in it's life, @{B}Amiga Survivor@{UB} was just a games magazine, but due to
it's popularity, it has grown to covering more 'serious' items, with the help of
some ex-@{B}CU Amiga@{UB} staff members. And in the coming months, @{B}AS@{UB} is set to gain more
pages, and the possibility of swelling to an A4 format!

@{B}Amiga  Survivor@{UB} has also recently gained the rights to distribute the incredibly
popular  U.S  publicaton, @{B}Amiga Informer@{UB} in the UK! Be one of the first European
residents  to  own  this  fine  magazine  by ordering it from the @{B}Amiga Survivor@{UB}
website. (@{B}http://www.crystal-software.com/AmigaSurvivor/survindex.html@{UB})

Of  course, @{B}Amiga Survivor@{UB} could always benefit from being even more popular, so
if  you're an @{B}Amiga@{UB} stockist anywhere in the world, then you could be one of the
many distributors to stock this new, popular publication. Please note that @{B}Amiga
Survivor@{UB} is available via mail-order only, and not on news-stands!

@{B}Amiga  Survivor@{UB}  is  the  ONLY  place  to  read  the Work-In-Progress of @{B}Gilbert
Goodmate  and  the Mushroom of Phungoria@{UB} (the excellent @{B}Monkey Island 3@{UB} / @{B}Disney@{UB}
inspired  adventure  game)  courtesy of @{B}Prelusion@{UB} and @{B}Crystal Software@{UB}. Read the
latest  games  reviews,  previews,  special  features, regular articles, and the
latest @{B}Amiga@{UB} news, all sandwiched between a glorious full colour cover!

If  you  require  any further information, then visit the website, or e-mail the
editor, @{I}Robert Iveson@{UI} at: @{I}robert@survivor.enterprise-plc.com@{UI}

You  can subscribe online for a bulk amount of issues, or merely just the one to
give  it  a  try.  You never know, it might be just what you're looking for in a
magazine.....

OCTOBER NEWS FROM UK @{B}AMIGA@{UB} DEALER @{B}CHROMA@{UB}
----------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Firstly, @{B}Chroma@{UB}`s website has moved - go to @{B}http://www.wensum.net/chroma@{UB} for all
the regular @{B}Amiga@{UB} systems & accessories, plus this month`s special deals. If you
forget  the  new URL, don`t worry - you`ll be transported automatically from the
old  site after a few seconds. The alternative URL of @{B}http://come.to/chroma@{UB} will
still do just as well.

Next,  the new e-mail address to go with the site relocation - @{I}chroma@wensum.net@{UI}
is the one to remember, for hardware enquiries and general stuff.

With the change of URL, the "@{B}AMR Voxel@{UB}" game-in-progress site has also moved. Go
to  @{B}http://www.wensum.net/blackfive@{UB}  to  check  out  the  latest  demos  of  the
@{B}PPC@{UB}-@{B}Amiga@{UB}-enhanced racing game which won a prize in the @{B}CU Amiga PowerUp@{UB} compo.

Chroma  can  now  undertake  site hosting, e-mail services and registered domain
hosting  as  well as website design. Check out @{B}http://www.wensum.net@{UB} for all the
details.

As  the  @{B}Lola L2000@{UB} S-video genlock has just ceased production (as has the @{B}L1500@{UB}
model),  @{B}Chroma@{UB}  is  now  offering  a  good deal on the @{B}Electronic Design Neptun@{UB}
S-video  model.  Visit  the  @{B}Chroma@{UB}  "specials" page for this month`s unbeatable
price.

Finally,  just a quick plug for the "Build a Power Tower Online" and "Build a @{B}PC@{UB}
Online"  pages on the @{B}Chroma@{UB} site. And - just as soon as the motherboards become
available - look out for a "Build a @{B}Boxer@{UB} System Online" page. Several customers
have already expressed an interest in this promising development.

Regards from Chroma.

@{B}FLEXCAT 2.1@{UB} RELEASED
--------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

@{I}INFO@{UI}

@{B}FlexCat@{UB}  creates  catalogs and the source to handle them. The difference between
@{B}FlexCat@{UB}  and  @{B}KitCat@{UB},  @{B}CatComp@{UB}  and  some others is, that @{B}FlexCat@{UB} is designed to
produce  any  source  you  want:  any programming language, any individual needs
should be satisfied. However, @{B}FlexCat@{UB} is not more difficult to use.

Translators  will  also  find  it  useful,  as,  among  standard  functions like
#?.catalog creation, @{B}FlexCat@{UB} is able to update your #?.ct files to the new #?.cd
files automatically. Give it a try!

This  sounds  like a contradiction. @{B}FlexCat@{UB}'s solution is to use template files,
the  so  called  "source  descriptions". Ready to use examples for @{B}Assembler@{UB}, @{B}C@{UB},
@{B}C++@{UB},  @{B}E@{UB},  @{B}Oberon@{UB}  and  @{B}Modula-2@{UB}  are  distributed,  additionally  an example for
supporting catalogs on @{B}Workbench 2.0@{UB}. Any other examples are welcome.

@{I}Archives@{UI}

Since  release  @{B}2.0@{UB},  the  @{B}FlexCat@{UB}  distribiution  is  splitted into the smaller
archives. They are (in order of importance):
FlexCat.lha        - Latest  @{B}FlexCat@{UB},  user  contribitions,  english  manual and
                     foreign catalog files
FlexCat_0x0.lha    - patches for @{B}020@{UB}, @{B}040@{UB} and @{B}060@{UB} versions of @{B}FlexCat@{UB} (@{B}PPC@{UB} makes
                     no sense here. I checked that).
FlexCat_ExDocs.lha - @{B}FlexCat@{UB}'s   guide   in  non  english  languages.  Currently
                     Svenska, Espanol and Deutsch are provided
FlexCat_CatSrc.lha - #?.cd   and  #?.ct  files  for  existing  translations  and
                     #?.texinfo documents

If you just want to use @{B}FlexCat@{UB}, the 1st archive is all you need.
If  you want to have CPU optimised binaries, take both 1st and 2nd and patch the
original release.
If  you want to read translated manual, get the 3rd one. If you want to make the
translation  take  the  4th  one  (but  I suggest to join the @{B}Amiga Translators'
Organisation@{UB} @{B}http://ato.vapor.com/ato@{UB} first!)

@{B}DIGITAL UNIVERSE@{UB} NEWS
---------------------

Originally written by @{B}Syzygy Research & Technology@{UB} on 13-Oct-98

Hi  there. This message is being sent to you since you recently purchased the CD
version @{B}1.03@{UB} of @{B}Digital Universe@{UB} for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. We intend to keep you abreast of
new  developments  related to @{B}Digital Universe@{UB} by sending email periodically. If
you'd  rather  that  we  not contact you in this fashion in the future, or would
prefer  that  we send messages to an alternate email address than the one we are
using, please let us know.

There are a few exciting things that we would like to tell you about:

@{I}SALES OF THE @{B}AMIGA@{UB} CD VERSION HAVE SURPASSED EXPECTATIONS@{UI}

We  released  @{B}V1.03@{UB}  of  our  software on CD (at a reduced cost) to see how many
people  out  there  are still purchasing @{B}Amiga@{UB} software. We're happy to say that
the response has been very encouraging - more people have purchased the software
than  we  anticipated. This is very good news for those of you waiting for us to
develop  @{B}V2.0@{UB}  of @{B}Digital Universe@{UB} for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} - it appears as though there is
still quite an active life in the @{B}Amiga@{UB} community.

At  the moment, we are trying to finish up @{B}Macintosh@{UB} and @{B}Windows@{UB} versions of the
software  (we  have  been working on them ever since our first release of @{B}DU@{UB} for
the @{B}Amiga@{UB} a few years ago, and hope to get them completed soon!) As a result, we
intend  to  first complete and release the @{B}Macintosh@{UB} version of the software. If
at  the time, the @{B}Windows@{UB} version is almost completed, we'd like to get that out
the  door  as soon as possible too. But then, we intend on working on a "new and
improved"  @{B}DU  V2.0@{UB}  for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. If you have any features that you just can't
live without, please let us know!

If  you'd  like  to  see  how  the  @{B}Mac@{UB} and @{B}Windows@{UB} versions of the software are
progressing  (since  work on @{B}DU V2.0@{UB} for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} hinges on how fast we can get
them     completed)    visit    @{B}http://www.syz.com/DU/mac/completion.html@{UB}    and
@{B}http://www.syz.com/DU/ibm/completion.html@{UB} respectively.

Of  course,  we'd still like to sell as many @{B}DU V1.03@{UB} CDs as we can. If you have
any  friends that you think may be interested in the program, please remind them
that  purchasing  @{B}V1.03@{UB}  now  for $75 Canadian (about $50 US) and upgrading when
V2.0 is released will cost exactly the same as just waiting for V2.0, so there's
no point in delaying!

@{I}FULLY-FEATURED @{B}DIGITAL UNIVERSE@{UB} MAILING LIST STARTS UP@{UI}

To  say  that  some of our @{B}Digital Universe@{UB} customers are enthusiastic about the
software  is sometimes a bit of an understatement. One such person is @{I}Bill Eaves@{UI}
of Scotland.

In  an effort to help promote the software as much as possible (and encourage us
that  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  software  marketplace  is  still  very  alive  and well), @{I}Bill@{UI}
currently  purchases  copies of the software in bulk for resale to people in the
UK. This makes it much easier (and less expensive) for those in the UK to obtain
copies of our software than ordering the package from us directly.

@{I}Bill@{UI}'s  latest  undertaking  is  setting  up  a  fully-featured @{B}Digital Universe@{UB}
mailing  list.  If  you want to stay in touch with other @{B}Digital Universe@{UB} users,
exchange  ideas on how to use the software, discuss astronomical-related issues,
etc.  I'm sure that you'll find the list useful and interesting. I'm a member of
the  list  myself,  and  though  it isn't an official support medium for @{B}Digital
Universe@{UB}  related  questions,  I'm  looking  forward to participating as much as
possible there.

You can join this list by going to the following web page:
@{B}http://www.onelist.com/subscribe.cgi/DUniverse@{UB}

Being  that  the list is so new, it's still pretty quiet at the moment. But @{I}Bill@{UI}
and @{I}I@{UI} are both hoping that the situation changes soon!

@{I}INFORMAL TALKS WITH @{B}AMIGA INC.@{UB}@{UI}

Lately  we've  been  talking informally with @{I}Fleecy Moss@{UI} of @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB}, to get a
bit of an idea where the @{B}Amiga@{UB} is headed, make sure that they know about @{B}Digital
Universe@{UB},  etc. We'll be doing everything we can to ensure that the next version
of  @{B}Digital  Universe@{UB}  is  fully compatible with, and takes advantage of the new
hardware and software features of the new @{B}Amiga@{UB}s. A new and updated @{B}Amiga@{UB} with a
new  and  updated  @{B}Digital  Universe@{UB}  is something we just can't wait to see and
experience!

As I'm sure you get judge from the tone of this letter, the future of @{B}DU@{UB} and the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  looks  very  bright.  If you have any comments or questions, please don't
hesitate  to  contact  me (and don't forget to join the @{B}Digital Universe@{UB} mailing
list!)

@{B}AMIGA RC5 TEAM@{UB} EFFORT MONTHLY NEWS
----------------------------------

12-Oct-98

Added  T-shirt survey page (@{B}homepage.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/rc5/T-shirt_form.html@{UB}),
please  submit  your  preferences ASAP so we can gauge interest for an @{B}Amiga RC5
Team@{UB}  Effort  T-shirt!  The design deadline has passed as well and three designs
have         come        in,        download        the        archive        at
@{B}homepage.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/rc5/misc/T-designs.lha@{UB}  to  see. New designs, ideas
and slogans are of course still most welcome!

09-Oct-98

@{I}John  Girvin@{UI}  (@{B}www.girvnet.freeserve.co.uk@{UB}) has collected a couple of 8SVX 'Moo'
samples    for    use    in    @{B}Myzar@{UB},    download    the    LZX    archive    at
@{B}www.girvnet.freeserve.co.uk/amiga/dl/bin/CowSamples.lzx@{UB}.  While  you're  at  it,
check      out      his      core      optimization     pages     for     @{B}RC5-64@{UB}
(@{B}www.girvnet.freeserve.co.uk/amiga/proj_rc564.html@{UB})            and           @{B}DES@{UB}
(@{B}www.girvnet.freeserve.co.uk/amiga/proj_des.html@{UB}).   @{I}John@{UI}   will  be  officially
joining  @{I}Stefan@{UI}  in  the  current '@{B}Amiga@{UB} client programmer team' shortly. If you
have trouble with the @{B}D.Net@{UB} 'mail me a password' link, you're right, it's broken
and      will      be      fixed      ASAP.      Check     out     the     @{B}D.Net@{UB}
(@{B}distributed.net/cgi/dnet-finger.cgi@{UB}) finger gateway for the latest info on this
kind of thing.

06-Oct-98

If  you  have downloaded @{B}Myzar v1.1@{UB}, please download it again (see miscellaneous
section at @{B}homepage.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/rc5/misc.html@{UB}), some debug code was left
in the first upload. Also Finnish catalog is now included in the archive.

04-Oct-98

@{B}Myzar@{UB} has been updated to @{B}v1.1@{UB}, now localized and with a stats window, check out
the  miscellaneous  section at @{B}homepage.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/rc5/misc.html@{UB}. Also,
@{B}D.Net@{UB}      now     sport     a     handy     finger     to     web     interface
(@{B}distributed.net/cgi/dnet-finger.cgi@{UB}),  various  programmers  and  @{B}Bovine@{UB} people
have  small updates there which do not warrant a full blown PR. Only two designs
have  reached  us  for  the T-shirt as yet, be creative and earn some fame, send
your ideas/designs to @{I}rc5@amiga.cistron.nl@{UI}

28-Sep-98

Another   handy  util  for  analyzing  logfiles,  this  time  by  @{I}Jacek  Rzeuski@{UI}
(@{I}jrzeuski@neptun.gdansk.tpsa.pl@{UI})  has  been  added  to the miscellaneous section
(@{B}homepage.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/rc5/misc.html@{UB}). Also a note on the small number of
blocks for Sep-22 (concerned all teams), the old stats server ran out of storage
on  that day (now replaced), but no worry, nothing is lost, those blocks will be
re-injected soon.

25-Sep-98

Time  to  celebrate  once again: today (nearly yesterday by a hair's breadth) we
moved  up  into  the  sixth  position, leaving the @{B}LinuxNet@{UB} team behind us. That
means there are only five teams who have contributed more to the @{B}Distributed Net@{UB}
effort  than  the @{B}Amiga@{UB}, and that out of thousands of teams! While this position
may  not change for quite a while, we are still growing and November tidings are
drawing  ever  nearer. Of course our main objective of exposure is being served,
and how!

Other  news:  @{B}Myzar@{UB}  is being localized as we speak, @{B}v1.1@{UB} should be out soon. We
need  your  ideas/design/whatever  for  the  T-shirt,  to this end a deadline of
October 7th has been decided on, so send everything you come up with before that
to @{I}rc5@amiga.cistron.nl@{UI}.

19-Sep-98

It has been a while since the last update, so news has been pooling up nicely:

While still only in the planning stages, a couple of things deserve mention: two
invitations  to  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  shows  have  reached  us,  one  for  the  @{B}Infomedia  '98@{UB}
(@{B}user.online.be/waasland/infomedia98/@{UB})  show in Antwerp, Belgium (October 3-4th)
and  one  for  the  @{B}Computer  '98@{UB}  (@{B}www.computer98.de@{UB})  show in Cologne, Germany
(November 13-15th). Both would be tremendous opportunities to promote the effort
and  meet people involved, interested or just members of the unsuspecting public
:).  Unfortunately  financial  commitments  may keep me from attending the first
one,  so volunteers are needed to man the space offered (even if I can there has
to  be  at  least  one  other  person  so a demo machine doesn't have to be left
alone),  promote  the  effort etc., otherwise the opportunity goes to waste. For
the  November  Cologne  show  the organizing @{B}Amiga-Club@{UB} (@{B}www.amiga-club.de@{UB}) also
kindly requests donations as they have to raise enough money to let us take some
of  their  space  in  the  first  place :) For more info or offers on both, mail
@{I}rc5@amiga.cistron.nl@{UI}.

Also  planned  are must-have-cool T-shirts which should be on sale by Cologne at
least, please send any ideas or designs again to @{I}rc5@amiga.cistron.nl@{UI}.

@{B}Distributed  Net@{UB} have decided on adding @{B}Optimal Golomb Rulers@{UB} (or @{B}OGR@{UB} for short,
look  at @{B}www.distributed.net/ogr/@{UB} for explanation) to the two ongoing challenges
as they are working towards the third generation of distributed clients. It will
be some more time before actual clients arrive, more on this later.

Other  news:  new  @{B}Myzar@{UB}  frontend  is  being  worked on, as well as (still) new
clients.  Over  300 @{B}PPC@{UB} equipped @{B}Amiga@{UB}s and more than 2500 machines in total are
participating  now  with regular rates over 400 Mkeys/s and we are very close to
overtaking the @{B}LinuxNet@{UB} team :)

14 October 1998: The Demo...

Right  then.  The  demo. Its here and ready to be downloaded to your machine! As
promised, I've managed to grab the alpha demo from the tech guys and place it on
this  site. Bear in mind this is an early version of the working program, and if
you  have  any  problems, please mail @{I}Oondy@q-group.demon.co.uk@{UI} and let him know
the  problem.  This  is  an  @{B}Amiga@{UB} program, so anyone using @{B}Mac@{UB} or @{B}PC@{UB} - leave it
alone please, we'll release the demo for your platform at a later date.

The  demo  is our copyright, and although it is freely available, anyone palming
it off as theirs will be dealt with legally.

Expect  to  see  more graphics and screenshots released exclusively on this site
very shortly.

07 October 1998: All sorts

It's been a busy few weeks here at @{B}Q Soft@{UB}.

Firstly, it's time for a name change again.

Although  the  paperwork  and  money has exchanged hands it appears that another
company  owns  the  rights  to the name @{B}Q Software Ltd@{UB}, even though that company
doesn't appear active. Therefore we need a new name which has yet to be decided.
The website will remain where it is, so don't worry about finding us - we're not
going anywhere!

Secondly, the demo is now rolling. It's a fairly basic demo which basically runs
the  game screens with all the interface graphics loaded and working for each of
the three screens. The world map can be scrolled around, the battle screen has a
couple of frisky tanks to play around with and the city screen can build cities.
Simple, no?

A  screenshot  of  the world map screen will be in the screenshots and downloads
section  tomorrow.  I  have placed a download of the firetank image on that page
for public consumption, so go have a butchers.

It's  also worth mentioning that the site was due to be uploaded a few days ago,
but  three things have impeded the company this week: The scanner has gone down,
which  in  turn  knocked out the @{B}PC@{UB} for three days. This is thanks to a fault in
@{B}Hewlett  Packard@{UB}'s  PCI  card  for said scanner. Lastly, @{B}Demon@{UB} have been messing
about resulting in little or no internet access since the 2nd October.

So, busy week. I will endeavour to get a downloadable demo as soon as possible.

@node art01 "MIDWEST AMIGA EXPO '98: A SHOW REPORT FROM THE FLOOR"

@{B}MIDWEST AMIGA EXPO '98@{UB}: A SHOW REPORT FROM THE FLOOR
----------------------------------------------------

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

@{B}Midwest  Amiga  Expo  '98@{UB}  (@{B}MAE@{UB} for short) has traditionally been one of the two
largest  yearly  shows  in  North America. This year with over 40 exhibitors and
vendors,  @{B}MAE@{UB}  may  have  just moved up a notch. All I can say is that my utmost
compliments  go out to show organizers @{I}Ronn Black@{UI} and @{I}Dave Pearce@{UI} (not to forget
the rest of the @{B}AmiCON@{UB} crew) who did an excellent job responding to the requests
and  needs  of  attendees  and  vendors as well as dealing with a few unexpected
complications.

The  show  officially  didn't start until Saturday morning, but that didn't stop
people  from  showing  up  beginning  early  Friday morning for the seminars and
classes  available  during  the  day.  Setup for show vendors/exhibitors started
roughly  at 5:00pm Friday and wrapped up while the vendor party was just getting
underway.  Vendor  lists  are available but I can't verify some of the people or
names  so to be fair and not exclude anyone, I'm going to deal with the personal
side  of  the show, rather than the technical "vendor x showed up and showed his
product x". I figure there will be plenty of those type reports.

The  only  thing  I  want  to press on product wise was an incredibly cool shirt
(which I am currently wearing to work at NASA) for sale by @{B}AmiCon@{UB} which featured
@{I}"Stop  The  Madness:  Buy  an  @{B}Amiga@{UB}"@{UI}  featured  with  a  picture of a CD titled
@{I}"@{B}Microsoft@{UB}  World  Domination  99 - Total Control Edition 1.0"@{UI}.. Contact them at
@{B}www.amicon.org@{UB}  to see if you can get your own, I promise you, it's really neat,
not to mention making people curious as you walk down the hall...

As of showtime Saturday, since @{I}RJ Mical@{UI} never made it to the show for one reason
or  another, @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}'s own @{I}Bill McEwen@{UI} gave the keynote at 5:00pm EST (GMT-5).
In  the  keynote address, @{I}Bill McEwen@{UI} gave us news of the upcoming release of @{B}OS
3.5@{UB}... He stated that he couldn't give pinpoint details because @{B}OS3.5@{UB} is under a
heavy  Non-Disclosure  Agreement (NDA) and is a joint/cooperative effort between
approximately 20 authors with @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}'s @{I}Fleecy Moss@{UI} leading the project.

For  the  first  time  ever  on  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}, you can hear the keynote speech for
yourself  in  .gsm format at @{B}ugn.amiga.org/events/audio.shtml@{UB}. This comes to you
courtesy  of  a  lot of hard work on the part of the @{B}User Group Network@{UB}'s Events
Coordinator  @{I}Bill  Borsari@{UI}  (@{I}tekmage@amiga.org@{UI})  and  a  whole dedicated crew of
people who made it happen, overcoming the technical odds.

A few highlights of his speech and the OS 3.5 info include;
 * Re-targetable Audio (RTA) Support
 * Re-targetable Graphics (RTG) Support
 * CD-Filing System (CDFS) Support
 * @{B}PPC@{UB} Co-Processor support built-in
 * Internet Ready
 * a newly updated and refined interface.
 * plus bug fixes and updates to several areas of the OS
 * due 1st Half, 1999

One  of the more interesting aspects of the new @{B}3.5@{UB} was stated that @{I}"@{B}OS 5.0@{UB} will
be  backwards  compatible with @{B}3.5@{UB}."@{UI} and that @{I}"All of the programs you have that
currently  run  under  @{B}3.1@{UB}  'should'  work  under  @{B}3.5@{UB}..."@{UI}  From  a  development
standpoint, this is incredible, but curious.

Of  the release dates, @{I}Bill@{UI} stated that complications with their initial partner
caused  delays  but  they've  found  a  new  partner  which is quote @{I}"much, much
better"@{UI}.  Unfortunately,  this will cause the release of the development machine
to  be  pushed  back  another 90 to 120 days from the original November release.
However!  (and  this  is VERY IMPORTANT) he went on to state that the release of
the  final  machine is still perfectly on track @{I}"for 4th Quarter, 1999 release"@{UI}.
(Everyone  was  trying  to ask questions at the same time, so not everyone heard
him say that part.)

Coming  soon  is  a  new @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} web page (site?) regarding the @{B}OS 3.5@{UB} and @{B}5.0@{UB}
progress  and upgrades. Mr. @{I}McEwen@{UI} made specific statements to say that they are
reorganizing  the  way  they  handle  press releases and in the future will give
exclusives  and  advanced  knowledge  to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Print magazines such as @{B}Amiga
Format@{UB}, @{B}Amazing Amiga@{UB}, and @{B}Amiga Informer@{UB}. This is presumably being done to help
stop  the  decline  of  @{B}Amiga@{UB} print magazines that has been so unfortunate as of

There  will  be  more information on @{B}OS 3.5@{UB} as well as a look at the development
machine revealed at @{B}Computer 98@{UB}, in Kouln Germany next month.

It  was  a  great show, in a great location (convention center) and for once, we
weren't  condemned to live off of hotel food as there was a food court and about
5 restaraunts in the convention center itself. The only downside reported by the
attendees  that  I've heard was parking availability and locating the show floor
itself in the extremely large center.

Several  vendors  had new press releases and product out to include a display of
@{B}NewTek@{UB}'s   (@{B}www.newtek.com@{UB})   new  "10X"  product,  a  new  release  of  @{B}Weblord@{UB}
(@{B}www.ringlord.com@{UB})  a  HTML  processing  utility,  and  the  @{B}User  Group Network@{UB}
(@{B}ugn.amiga.org@{UB})  itself  who  announced not only a new website, but a new focus,
and partnerships as well.

You could hear developers and attendees alike discussing @{I}Carl Sassenrath@{UI}'s newly
released  @{B}REBOL@{UB}  programming language and the possibilities it opens up to @{B}Amiga@{UB}
online designers.

During the developer meeting with @{B}ICOA@{UB} Representative, @{I}Kermit Woodall@{UI} alerted us
a  few  surprises  as  they announced a new refocusing of effort, a new upcoming
website  (at  @{B}www.amiga.net@{UB}),  and  a very much streamlined management/committee
organization.

@{I}"We're  no longer going to operate where things might sit in a committee with no
progress."@{UI} reported Mr. @{I}Woodall@{UI}. @{I}"We will absolutely have to institute a way for
things  to  get  done  efficiently  and  if  there's no progress being made on a
project  [or  team],  we'll  have to find a way to make it happen."@{UI} He also went
into  depth on a new exciting project (the brainchild of @{B}AI@{UB}'s own @{I}Darreck Lisle@{UI})
to help developers protect against software piracy.

@{I}After Dark....@{UI}

After  the  show  floor closes at an @{B}Amiga@{UB} show is not the time to simply get in
the car and go home. On the contrary, it's usually the best time to meet, greet,
and  mingle  with the developers, owners, and representatives from the top @{B}Amiga@{UB}
efforts at the show.

Thursday Night (before the show) there were several people who gathered into the
"Big  Bar  on  2" at the Hyatt Regency for cocktails and conversations. Of major
interest  to  most  of  the  people  present were the prototype boards that @{I}Jens
Schoenfeld@{UI}  of  @{B}Individual  Computers@{UB}  (@{B}www.jshoenfeld.com@{UB})  brought to display.
Really neat stuff!

Friday  night,  there  was  a setup/developer party to include "sumo wrestling",
free  munchies  and  beer, and a GREAT live band. I suppose the highlight of the
evening  is when @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}'s User Group Relations Coordinator, @{I}Darreck Lisle@{UI} and
Former  @{B}Amiga  Inc@{UB} Engineer, @{I}Joe Torre@{UI} were set to square off in the giant latex
sumo outfits. Without warning, @{I}Joe@{UI} turned to face his opponent, then spun around
and ran off through the hotel attracting a truly miraculous amount of attention.
To keep @{I}Darreck@{UI} from being disappointed, @{I}Rick Giannini@{UI} (@{B}AsimWare@{UB}) volunteered to
step  forward  and  pummel  him  without  the aid of a sumo suit. To quote @{I}Rick@{UI},
@{I}"Suit? I don't need no stinking suit..."@{UI}

Saturday night, the party resumed at a local hotspot called @{I}Jillian@{UI}'s. For those
of  you who have never seen a Jillian's, it's the consumate sports bar with pool
tables,  lots of large Televisions, lots of loud music, and crowds galore. About
100  or so attended the party and tinkered with the Televisions putting an @{B}Amiga@{UB}
up  on  them to run music mods and video effects through some sort of new box (I
didn't get a look at it) that @{I}Darreck@{UI} had bought earlier in the day. We convened
to  the  video  arcade where 8 of us went head to head in a game or 5 of @{B}Rush@{UB} (a
road  racing game). Show organizer, @{I}Ronn Black@{UI} repeatedly humiliated the other 7
of  us  with  his  victories  although  some  suspect that he had the home-field
advantage.

The  evening at @{I}Jillian@{UI}'s couldn't have ended better, as we all gathered round a
giant 60" TV to watch @{B}South Park@{UB}. Most then reconvened back at the hotel for the
traditional  selection  of Canadian beverages as supplied by @{B}AsimWare@{UB}'s own @{I}Rick
Giannini@{UI}.

Alas,  Sunday for yours truly was cut short as we had to catch a flight at about
noon  (2  hours  into  the  show) but the fun and excitement will easily last me
until the next known show (@{B}Gateway Amiga Show@{UB} in St. Louis) in March 1999.

Enjoy, and sorry if you couldn't make it... You missed a lot!

@node art03 "TEAM AMIGA'S UNOFFICIAL OS3.5 FAQ"

@{B}TEAM AMIGA@{UB}'S UNOFFICIAL @{B}OS3.5@{UB} FAQ
---------------------------------------------------

Question:

Why  these  high  system  requirements  for the @{B}OS3.5@{UB} Upgrade? Up to now @{B}AOS@{UB} was
running on ALL @{B}Amiga@{UB}s!!

The  "honest"  answer: To encourage customers to upgrade their hardware and thus
provide input and sales activity for the market.

The  "tricky"  answer: The new OS will deliver more power and functionality, but
it cannot do this unless the hardware platform supports it to do this.

The  "some  people  might find the following statement offensive" answer: listen
Sunshine, we've seen the likes of you before. Always whining about how slow your
7  MHz  @{B}A500@{UB}  is,  how  difficult  it is to upgrade that crummy machine and then
expecting  @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} to work miracles, possibly even by releasing any OS update
for  free.  If  you  want a miracle, go join a church. And not the Church of the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}!

The  "historical"  answer: When the last @{B}AmigaOS@{UB} update was released, @{B}Windows 95@{UB}
and the @{B}Pentium@{UB} processor were still two years from delivery. Today the standard
@{B}PC@{UB}  configuration  is a 64 MByte, 233 @{B}Pentium II@{UB} machine with @{B}Windows 98@{UB}. Do you
really  believe  that  requiring  an  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  system  that  was  considered "high
performance" in 1988 is asking too much of you?

The "embarrassing" answer: @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} wants to make sure that all @{B}Amiga@{UB}s running
@{B}OS 3.5@{UB} are at least as fast as @{B}UAE@{UB}, running on a 233 @{B}Pentium II@{UB}.

The  "that's  what @{I}Heinlein@{UI} would have said" answer: Think of it as evolution in
action.

The  "you  gotta be kidding" answer: Actually, @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} had *you* in mind when
they pictured the kind of customer they don't want to buying @{B}OS 3.5@{UB}.

The "obvious" answer: Are you stupid or what?

The  "that's what Darwin would have said" answer: Only the fittest Amiga Classic
computers will survive.

The "buzz off" answer: Why don't you go upgrade your @{B}PC@{UB}?

Find the shoe that fits and wear it please ... :)

@{I}FLEECY MOSS@{UI}, @{B}AMIGA INC.@{UB} MONTHLY IRC
-----------------------------------

@{I}TA@{UI}: Did everyone seen @{I}Marcus Nerding@{UI}'s statement about @{B}PPC 3.5@{UB}? He said they are
NOT doing an actual port, they are adding @{B}PPC@{UB} support to @{B}3.5@{UB} as it happens.

@{I}TA@{UI}:  @{I}elho@{UI}: No, @{B}H&P@{UB} is going to make sure that @{B}PPC@{UB} calls are made from within the
new @{B}3.5@{UB} for those who have @{B}PPC@{UB} Cards.

@{I}CyberWolf@{UI}:  @{I}TA@{UI}:  @{B}H&P@{UB}  will  show  @{B}PPC 68k@{UB} emulation at the @{B}AMIGA@{UB} show in Cologne
though it's just a ß version

@{I}CyberWolf@{UI}: @{I}MagiX@{UI}: @{B}H&P@{UB} emulation is in ß now, but they are not the only one to do
@{B}3.5@{UB}!

@{I}TA@{UI}: @{B}H&P@{UB} is working with @{B}AI@{UB}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: Hey everybody 8-)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  Just  to  rush  this  up, I only have an hour - @{I}Elspeth@{UI} is escaping the
crying and the wailing and going out at 6pm - then I have baby duties.....

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  Also,  apologies for turning up on a @{B}PC@{UB} - I have given up trying to get
my  @{B}A4000@{UB}  to  do  anything  and am taking it in to @{B}Software Hut@{UB} on thursday for
major surgery

@{I}TA@{UI}:  Everyone  knows  @{I}Fleecy  Moss@{UI} of @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} fame, welcome @{I}Fleecy@{UI}. How's that
baby?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: @{I}TA@{UI}: noisy, and with a bigger breast appetite than @{I}Bill Clinton@{UI} ;-)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: ok, so what do you want to talk about? The weather, halibut prices???

@{I}TA@{UI}: @{I}Fleecy@{UI}, who did the art for the new web page?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: Why?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: ...and no, it wasn't me - I swore off art after the @{B}JMS@{UB} webpages - never
again.....

@{I}TA@{UI}:  The  @{B}3.5@{UB}  page?  Well, the @{B}3@{UB} is a little messed up and one of our peeps was
thinking of sending in a bug fix ... :)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  Actually,  there  will be a weekly article on the pages, and we may ask
for some user input for various parts of the @{B}OS3.5@{UB} project

@{I}Jumpy@{UI}:  @{I}fleecy@{UI}:  Will the newer OS's come with any developer tools?  (Compilers,
etc..)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  The developer boxes will ship with developer tools, if that is what you
mean.  For  the  user versions, then that is upto the OEMs and third parties who
ship - I would like to see tools that get the ordinary user into programming.

@{I}T-tam@{UI}:  @{I}Fleecy@{UI},  have @{B}AI@{UB} hired people to code @{B}OS5@{UB} (assuming @{I}Allan@{UI} won't do it on
his own ;-) and when can we find out who they hire? ga

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: boy, you are a shy lot tonight ;-)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}T-tam@{UI}:  @{I}Allan@{UI}  knows  who is going to be in his team - we haven't hired
them  yet  for  a number of reasons that are related to job perks, descriptions,
location  etc  -  they are all on for the technology though. I would imagine you
should know them all by Christmas

@{I}TA@{UI}: We're going easy on ya because of @{I}Evie@{UI} ... :)

@{I}MagiX@{UI}: Will memory protection be included in @{B}OS 3.5@{UB} ?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: ;-)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}MagiX@{UI} - we do not plan on it. I am getting a lot of FAQs which have ppl
wanting  us  to  support  everything  from  MP,  JAZ, DVD, Stardrives and a beer
dispenser  in  @{B}OS3.5@{UB}. @{B}OS3.5@{UB} is a transitional OS to get the community to @{B}OS5@{UB}. It
has a limited lifespan, and given that @{B}OS5@{UB} machines should be out this time next
year,  we  do  not  see  it  as  being  a  priority  to  add  these considerable
enhancements when they will be available on the new machines.

@{I}Agima@{UI}: It's been said there will be a new interface to @{B}3.5@{UB}. What elements of the
current @{B}Workbench@{UB} GUI will change?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}Agima@{UI}:  We  are  planning  on  changing  a  lot  for the interface. New
icon.library,  improved  layout  engine,  new artwork, hopefully a new WB if our
resident genius can do it in time. As we get closer, we will release screenshots
and other teasers for you.

@{I}Dracvl@{UI}:  I  was  just  wondering  if I can implement the @{B}OS5dev@{UB} platform into my
existing @{B}PC@{UB} system, or do I have to buy a new box altogether?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}Drac@{UI}: We will get around to producing a @{B}PC@{UB} upgrade kit, that allows ppl
to  use  existing @{B}PC@{UB}s. However, this will consist of the gfx card and sound card
etc  that  we are writing for. We hope to be able to announce these by christmas
so ppl who want to can buy them then, or get Santa to drop them off ;-)

@{I}SweDane@{UI}:  When  can  we expect to see som specs on the @{B}Amiga NG@{UB}? Or atleast some
info on the so called @{B}Magic Mystery Chip@{UB}. ga

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}SweDane@{UI}:  The  chip remains the piece that you will find out about last
(due to the company refusing to release specs for it to anyone but NDA). We will
have  announcements about the kernal at Cologne including, hopefully, the kernal
company.   I  just  want  to  say  here  that  although  we  did  suffer  a  big
disappointment  at  @{B}WoA@{UB}, it has allowed us to get a new partner, and one that is
miles better ;-)

@{I}DrJekyl@{UI}: has anyone "interfaced" with @{B}H&P@{UB} about a possible @{B}PPC@{UB} eliment to @{B}WB 3.5@{UB}
?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}DrJ@{UI}: @{B}OS3.5@{UB} will see the @{B}H&P PPC@{UB} engine integrated into the @{B}OS3.5@{UB} build.
However,  this is ONLY for third party apps to run on -NO part of @{B}OS3.5@{UB} will run
on the @{B}PPC@{UB} co-processor cards.

@{I}hesido@{UI}:  will  we have big hardware developers to include @{B}amiga@{UB} software related
to  that  hardware  on  their cd's? or even, the necessary drivers would do, and
"@{B}amiga@{UB}  compatible"  sign,  so  that  there's a stronger public image for @{B}amiga@{UB}.
(e.g. currently canon printers have @{B}amiga@{UB} drivers, etc.) ga

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}hesido@{UI}:  I presume you are talking about the Next Generation products -
in  that  case,  then  yes, we are talking with all of the HW manufacturers. @{B}USB@{UB}
will go a long way to making HW interfaces transparent anyway.

@{I}T-tam@{UI}:  To  what extent do you anticipate @{B}CORBA@{UB} being implemented in @{B}OS5@{UB} - basic
v2  support,  or  full IIOP support? Also major OS's are now shipping out of the
box with internet services (www, mailserver, ftp), do you plan that for @{B}OS5@{UB}?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: @{I}T-tam@{UI}: I hope to god that some elements of @{B}CORBA@{UB} are in the OS - if not,
then  the  kernal partner already has a nano-ORB which could form the basis of a
proper  implementation.  @{B}OS5@{UB} will provide transparent connectivity to any remote
or distributed datasource. With @{B}DC@{UB} we are rewriting the vocabulary. This will be
seamless integration, putting a person and not the technology first.

@{I}Jamesc@{UI}: Is there anything 'new' on the development environment since we last had
you here to talk with us? ie: Any closer idea on dates or anything like that for
the  developers  package being ready? I'm keen to get one of those boards up and
running  personally.  Also,  any idea on what it will cost us? Will Compilers be
immediately available? What Compilers? Can I do anything in preparation? Or just
wait?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}Jamesc@{UI}:  the  developer  boxes  are our priority right now. The various
elements  of  them are coming together and, once the kernal partner is confirmed
then we should see it all come together quickly. Once we announce the k-partner,
you  can  descend  on their website and devour their masses of information, thus
getting  upto  speed  on the kernal. You can also learn @{B}OpenGL@{UB}, since it will be
big, as well as @{B}USB@{UB} and @{B}Firewire@{UB} protocols. That should hold

@{I}elho@{UI}:  Can  you  tell us anything new about @{B}OS 3.5@{UB}? What will the net support be
(known  products)?  Can  I  install  it  without the @{B}PPC@{UB} support (and use the @{B}p5
powerUP@{UB} which I prefer)? GA

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  sometime  late 1Q99/early 2Q99 - and yes, they will ship with developer
tools

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  I can't tell you much more about @{B}OS3.5@{UB}, since our policy now is to give
new information out through the mags first (helping them hopefully) but yes, you
can  just  not install, or reinstall a favourite piece if you don't like what we
have  to  offer. However the @{B}PPC@{UB} piece will be quite different from the existing
one  -we  are encouraging them to open it out, tweak it, and we even have one of
their fiercest critics as a beta tester, so we hope to

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: ...we are not going to play politics......

@{I}DrFraggle@{UI}:  Couldn`t you simply put an @{B}3.1@{UB}-kickfile on the @{B}3.5@{UB}-CD? I don`t wan`t
to buy the rom as there is little difference to 3.0...

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}DrF@{UI}:  not  all machine configurations allow a soft boot. Besides which,
the  build  is  being  done  on the @{B}OS3.1@{UB} build - that decision has already been
made.   Whilst  no  one  wants  to  hear  it,  @{B}OS3.1@{UB}  has  been  out  for  quite
sometime...........enough time to buy it.

@{I}CyberWolf@{UI}:  Hi  @{I}Fleecy@{UI}:  Will  you  be there in Cologne? Are you in contact with
current  @{B}AMIGA@{UB}  developers  to  port  there progs (@{B}PageStream@{UB}, @{B}Digital Universe@{UB},
@{B}World  Construction  Set@{UB}...)  to  the  new  @{B}AMIGA@{UB}  and  are  there  @{B}PC@{UB} companies
interested in the new @{B}AMIGA@{UB} like @{B}Corel@{UB}, @{B}Adobe@{UB} etc. /GA

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: @{I}cyberWolf@{UI}: yes, yes and yes - I expect to drink lots of good german beer
in  Cologne (I mean work hard ;-)), I have spoken to many developers, and I need
to  speak  to  many  more  -  I  encourage  all of them to email me directly. @{B}PC@{UB}
companies  are beating our doors down wanting to write for a nice OS - we invite
them in, show them around ;-)

@{I}Agima@{UI}: Some people are saying @{B}3.5@{UB} is just @{B}3.1@{UB} with all the hacks integrated (e.g
@{B}KingCON@{UB}, @{B}CGFX@{UB}, @{B}AHI@{UB})... what is your response to them?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}Agima@{UI}:  @{B}OS3.5@{UB} is a transitional OS. We will not reinvent the wheel when
something  already exists that does the job. We will take what exists, integrate
it properly, instead of it being backed and patched in and let it ride. However,
there  is  a substantial amount of new work going on as well, more than most ppl
will  guess  at.  We  will  release  details  as  time progresses since 3 months
development time is not a lot and I want to be sure we can hi

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  Please  understand,  we  have  6 months - 3 months to alpha, 6 weeks to
beta,  2  weeks  stability  and then 4 weeks to manufacturer and distribute - if
anyone  knows  anything about development, they will understand just how much we
can do safely in 3 months.

@{I}Merko@{UI}:  @{I}fleecy@{UI}:  First,  thanks  a lot for having the balls to change your minds
about  @{B}3.5@{UB}!  Adds  a lot of credibility for the future! :) Now back to less rosy
things: What about @{B}Phase5@{UB} reactions to @{B}H&P@{UB} providing the @{B}PPC@{UB} support for @{B}3.5@{UB}? Do
you  think you will be able to make @{B}H&P@{UB} and @{B}Phase5@{UB} cooperate somehow, I wouldn't
like  a PPC@{UB} kernel running on my machine in spite of the manufacturer of the @{B}PPC@{UB}
card, and made without first hand HW information.. :/ GA

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}Merko@{UI}:  @{B}P5@{UB}  are in a tough position. They feel betrayed by us, and to a
certain  extent, that is fair - they had the balls to lead the @{B}Amiga@{UB} when no one
else would - unfortunately, @{B}GW2K@{UB}'s vision is just different.

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  However,  they understand why we have chosen the @{B}H&P@{UB} version - and they
have  said  they  won't  do  anything to screw it up - and why would they - this
should  mean  more  sales for them; and besides which, there are other companies
out  there  about  to  introduce  co-processor products of their own they have a
market to lose so I can't see them doing anything to jepoardise that.

@{I}MagiX@{UI}:  What about popular proprietary standards closed to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} communauty,
like certainly the most important, @{B}Realaudio@{UB}? I think it's too late for @{B}3.5@{UB}, but
may  we  hope  for  some solution before @{B}OS5@{UB} ? Or is Java the only solution ? (I
mean for al

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}MagiX@{UI}:  @{B}Os5@{UB}  will  postively  hum  with  support for all these open and
industry standards - have no fear on that account.

@{I}Asha@{UI}:  @{I}Fleecy@{UI},  this  isn't  an  @{B}OS3.5@{UB}  question  but  I feel it's important. :)
@{B}Compuserve@{UB}  is  about  to  turn  off  the  machines that run the ASCII interface
leaving  @{B}Amiga@{UB}s without the ability to access that service in native modes (must
emulate).  @{B}CSi@{UB}  is  willing  to  make  the specs for their RPA (security) module
available to anyone wishing to write a pluggin for their browser access. We have
contacted  the  browser  people but they don't seem interested. Can @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB} do
anything to insure or encourage the writing of this RPA?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}Asha@{UI}  -  that is a shame - send me the details off line and I will look
into it.

@{I}T-tam@{UI}: Are you showing, or have you shown, the kernal partner the results of the
ICOA prog model working group? (sorry @{I}fleecy@{UI}, had to get that one in ;-)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: @{I}T-tam@{UI}: that should be happening this week 8-)

@{I}gregr@{UI}: When are we going to see website updates? I see @{B}amiga.com@{UB} has @{B}3.5@{UB} info on
it now, that's good. What about the @{B}ICOA@{UB}? We're approaching late Oct. now.. What
about  @{B}TAS@{UB}? (sorry, I spared you at @{B}MAE@{UB}, so I couldn't resist. You don't have to
answer that one here! Mail me tho! :-)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}gregr@{UI}:  the @{B}OS3.5@{UB} website will be updated weekly - I will post a weekly
update and update the FAQ, so you don't have to visit every day -= you will know
when  it  is  updated. @{B}ICOA@{UB} - talk to @{I}Kermit@{UI} since he is in charge of that now -
@{B}TAS@{UB}  -  working on it today, and I may have some interesting information for the
group soon ;-)

@{I}Jumpy@{UI}:  @{I}fleecy@{UI}:  Is @{I}William Hawes@{UI} working with @{B}Ainc.@{UB} to update @{B}AREXX@{UB} with either
new @{B}Amiga OS@{UB}? Will @{B}REBOL@{UB} be integrated? =)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}Jumpy@{UI}:  no,  he  hates  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  since  @{B}Commodore@{UB} "allegedly" screwed him
moneywise  (like  everyone  else!!!)  -  we are working with someone else to see
@{B}Arexx@{UB} updated. I am talking to @{I}Carl@{UI} about @{B}Rebol@{UB} but no promises yet.

@{I}_3Demon@{UI}:  Are  you still in contact with @{B}NewTek@{UB}? How do they look at the current
situation?  And  will  they  start  developing @{B}Lightwave 3D@{UB} - which is in my and
manys  opinion  the  only  real  Highend  3D program out... I know they recently
started marketing the @{B}VideoToaster@{UB}/@{B}Flyer@{UB} aggressivly..

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}_3Demon@{UI}:  we talk to @{B}Newtek@{UB} every other day - they are pissed about the
@{B}A4000@{UB},  as  are  we - stupid legal crap that we can do nothing about since it is
all @{I}Hembach@{UI}'s problem. They are very keen on the new products we are working on.
Don't  forget though, that with the new machine, you will start to see the other
3D  apps  such  as  @{B}Imagine@{UB},  @{B}Aladdin@{UB}  and  that  Italian  one who's name I have
embarrasingly forgotten really take stage.

@{I}DC1@{UI}:  @{I}Fleecy@{UI}:  I was just wondering if there will be any improvements to the @{B}3.1@{UB}
code or just plain old @{B}3.1@{UB} with some neat

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}DC1@{UI}:  We are adding and integrating a lot of stuff but, since this is a
transitional  product,  we  are  not  going  to add stuff that will see it being
competitive in say five years time.

@{I}Agima@{UI}:  @{B}OS3.1@{UB} comes on six disks. How on earth are you going to justify sticking
@{B}3.5@{UB} on a CD? Lots of shareware included maybe? Or will @{B}3.5@{UB} be REALLY big? :)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  We thought we'd have backdrop MPEGs of us wandering around South Dakota
lost ;-)

@{I}Manowar2@{UI}: @{I}fleecy@{UI}: thank for replying my interview request today. Thx!. Do u plan
to  bundle  a  new  version  @{B}ISIS PPC@{UB} VideoCD/MPEG2 Player or AVI/QT player as a
default multimedia player software for @{B}OS3.5@{UB}? GA

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  No,  we  will  use  the  extra space for promoting commercial products,
demos,  user  groups  etc  - the actual space will probably be between 20 and 50
meg,  if  that.  The  driving  force  for  CD  ROM  is  that we are only 5 years
late.......

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}Manowar@{UI}:  you're  welcome  ;-) Hope it isn't more of the same old stuff
(interview) - we are looking at a QT player - we are also

@{I}Keith@{UI}:  Hi  @{I}Fleecy@{UI}.  You  say that "there are other companies out there about to
introduce  co-processor  products  of  their own" re @{B}PPC@{UB} - can you say any more?
Will  we  be getting @{B}PPC@{UB} with L2 cache, for example? Multiple @{B}PPC@{UB} solution (e.g.
quad  @{B}G3@{UB}  on  a card)? i.e. are there any solutions comming out which are better
than my existing @{B}604e PowerUp@{UB} card? If so, when? GA

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: looking at the datatypes as well.

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}Keith@{UI}  :  I  wish  I could tell you but I can't - NDAs but this time at
least with @{B}Amiga@{UB} companies - there are some nice solutions coming out soon.

@{I}Asha@{UI}:  @{I}Fleecy@{UI}:  Another non @{B}OS.3.5@{UB} question....:) I find it distressing that the
@{B}Amiga@{UB},  a  computer  known  for  its graphic capabilities does not have a decent
driver  for  graphic tablets. Would it be possible for @{B}AI@{UB} to get @{B}Wacom@{UB} to supply
us  drivers (full featured) as they do for other systems? Or, if not, is there a
way for @{B}AI@{UB} to insure that there is a good driver created and supported for us?

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}Asha@{UI}:  I  thought there were some tablets - I know I saw a review in @{B}AF@{UB}
for  some.  However, as much as I hate to say it, companies will not do the work
for a few thousand sales - the new machine is a different story....sorry 8-(

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: ...3 more questions

@{I}CyberWolf@{UI}: @{I}Fleecy@{UI}. (The Italian Raytracer is called @{B}Tornado3D@{UB}. Just installed it
today! Marvellous!) Will we see TRUE GFX @{B}AMIGA@{UB} powerstations &aacute; la @{B}Silicon@{UB}
GFX? Are there hardware partners interested in it? GA

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: and then the baby has my attention ;-)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  @{I}CyberWolf@{UI}:  A  lot  of  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  HW companies are very keen on these
"niche"  markets,  using the power of the new products to produce complete audio
studios,  graphics  stations and more - you will not be disappointed - just make
the  HW  companies know you will want this stuff - sometimes it is hard for them
to see the good times for the bad .....

@{I}Amigaman@{UI}: hi @{I}fleecy@{UI} ..I know its early days yet but has @{B}AI@{UB} a price point in mind
for @{UB}3.5@{UB} :-)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  They  do,  but  I'm  not allowed to tell you 8-( However, given it is a
romless update, it shouldn't be too hard for half a monkey to work it out ;-)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}: Hey @{I}darren@{UI}, long time no chat 8-)

@{I}darren@{UI}: hi @{I}fleecy@{UI} - i heard the november box has been delayed. Any updates? (and
we're gonna kick your ass in the derby on saturday ;) GA

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  DREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAM ON boy!!! We have our new super African
and you just have old old men 8-)

@{B}TA@{UB}: Soccer, what a life?  :)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  Developer  box news is that we expect late 1Q99/early 2Q99 the november
timeframe  was  based  upon  the old partner who screwed us at @{B}WOA@{UB} - the wait is
well worth it though - believe me.

@{B}TA@{UB}:  @{I}fleecy@{UI}: Thanks for stopping in. Please tell the wife how much we appreciate
this! :)

@{I}fleecy@{UI}:  Thanks  everyone  -  same time next month - and keep tuned to the @{B}OS3.5@{UB}
site
