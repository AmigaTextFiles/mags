@NODE edit "Editorial Page"
Well, hello there!  If this is a shock to you, just think about how I feel!

It's been a long time, old friends.  A long time.  But AEM is back in
business and has no plans on disappearing this time.

In our last episode (the last issue of AEM, which was in December, 1994), I
left you with the promise of continuing the tradition of reviews aplenty in
the pages of Amiga Game Zone magazine and Jason Compton's Amiga Report.  I
did manage to write a few reviews for Amiga Report.  However, considering
the year I had in 1995, getting even that done was a miracle.  (I don't
think Amiga Game Zone even published an issue in 1995, did they?  Anyone
have any information on the status of the magazine?)

What happened last year?  Well, let's just say A LOT!  I went through a lot
of personal stuff and it was not a lot of fun.  But, it's a new year and
things are really looking good now!

So, after a bumpy 1995...AEM's back!  I have to admit that it's not going to
be the same old AEM though.  The focus of the magazine will be a little bit
different.  Although only a year has passed, times have changed.  While
we're still going to do game reviews, I will be doing all kinds of different 
things with a focus on the Amiga and the Internet. 

"Entertainment" is a broad term and, thankfully, it allows me to continue this
magazine under it's original banner.  The Internet is full of a lot of 
entertaining things.  So, as we find them, we will share them with you.  The 
World Wide Web, IRC and USENET have the ability to bring people together in 
a way that has never been possible before.  However, for it to be of any use, 
someone has to point the way.  We're, obviously, not the first to think of
that, but wouldn't it be nice to have someone looking for things that may be
of interest to an Amiga owner like yourself?

Having an Amiga doesn't mean you have to settle for less.  While all the
other (cough) "real computer" (hack) owners are tinkering with their
AUTOEXEC.BAT files, trying to squeeze out another 5K of RAM so the latest
whiz-bang game will finally work, we'll be cruising the 'net for topics that
Amiga users can relate to, use and benefit from. 

I hope you enjoy reading this issue as much as I have enjoyed putting it
together for you.  It's good to be back!

We're also looking for contributions that you might feel are of interest to
our readers.  To contact us, simply send off an e-mail to one of our
electronic addresses.

The serial port is NOW OPEN FOR BUSINESS!!!! 

Please, please, please send your comments, ancedotes and whatever else you
can think of via e-mail!!!

I want to know what you did over the last year.  Did you miss AEM?  Is an 
online Amiga games magazine relevant anymore? 

Thanks to our advance announcement on THE AMIGA WEB DIRECTORY, we received
some e-mail even before this issue's release:

-----From Jason Compton, Amiga Report:

Hey, congratulations.  I hope you don't term writing for AR as being 
"tumultuous", though.  Good luck with the magazine!  While I realize 
you'll have your own gig again, I would still be interested in working 
together...

-----From Terence Davis:

I have noticed that all mags (on and off line) do not cover or even understand
ppc technology. One sugested the 1st Power Amiga should be 601 based mid level
insted of 604 high end. The 601 will probably not be still in production in 97.
T sugested that the DEC Alpha would have been a better choice. Byte magazine
ran tests using the same softwere (including Operating System ie NT) and set up
ie ram hard disk etc. A 604 at 100 Mhz was eqel to pentium pro at 150 Mhz
Though the P6 costs 60% more than a same clock 604. Another computer with 2
604's at 133 Mhz each was a match for one with a modern dec Alpha at 300 Mhz
BUT the Alpha system cost 50% more. These tests were on machines available at
the time. With the new 166 Mhz 604e almost here , the eqivelent low power 603
and uprated 620 there will some real power available to the Power Amiga by fist
quater of 97 even if there next generation replacments the 613 and 614 at 266
Mhz have not arived yet.By the way all speeds are base. ie a 166 and 266 Mhz
will evetully run at 200 and 300 Mhz respectivly.
	I know this seem a long way of but 1 year is not long in computers so 
it is time we started to tell A.T. what we want so plese inform people of what 
there is. By the way we should also be asking about the new propriotary chip set
which will NOT be AAA. It will have 1024 x 768 and 640 x 480 8bit 16 bit stereo
sound at 44.1 and 22.05 but these are only the minimum specifications alawed by
the Power PC Platform.
	 Sorry about my spelling but I am dislexic.
	 I realize most of this you probably know but no one is telling the 
Amiga public any thing so please do so.
		Yours ,
			Terry.

[Ed. note -- I confess my ignorance of not understanding PPC technology at 
all.  However, I include this letter in the magazine to get the word out, 
which is what Terry wanted me to do.  If someone wishes to contribute an 
article to explain this to someone like me, please contact me via e-mail!]

Hi,

@NODE GAME1 "Cyber Games v1.2 Review by Sean Caszatt"
TITLE: CYBER GAMES v1.2
METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION: SHAREWARE
OBTAINED FROM: AMINET'S GAMES/MISC DIRECTORY

If you can remember the heyday of the Commodore 64, you might remember a
game called BARBARIAN.  If not, let me briefly explain the object of the
game.  In a nutshell:  seperate your opponent's head from its body.

BARBARIAN preceded the infamous MORTAL KOMBAT by about seven years and, if
you can remember how popular MK was with kids, you can probably imagine how
kids reacted to it in the '80's.  They loved it.  I believe an Amiga version
was released at around the same time but, since I couldn't afford an Amiga
back then, I never played it.  Looking back, it seems kind of simplistic, 
but most of the games we know remember as "classics" were simple as well as 
very addicting.

Well, some European programmers have taken the BARBARIAN concept and given
it an update to a cyberpunkish theme and added a few bits of their own.

The game itself is basically a 2D swordfighting game that pits two players,
either a human vs computer or human vs human, against each other.  Using the
joystick, a number of different "moves" are available, like thrusting the
sword at your opponent's chest, spin moves, ducking and jumping.  An added
feature not available in BARBARIAN is a scaffolding that can be climbed, and
dangled from, which gives you the ability to get on the other side of your 
opponent.  Another new feature is the ability to buy powerups, like bionic
arms and bigger weapons.

The graphics are mostly well done.  The movement of the fighters is a
bit on the jerky side, but, as a whole, the visuals are pleasing to the eye.
Some of the intro sections of the game feature digitized pictures of the
programmer's relatives that have been altered into some rather fearsome
looking fighters.

The sound and music during the intro is top-notch, but it falters slightly 
during the actual game.  Still, it's not bad.

The main problem, and the reason I can't recommend the game, is the control
of the fighters.  There are a lot of moves to make and the computer doesn't
have to fumble with the joystick to make them.  Too many times I found
myself struggling to make a move of any kind, only to look up and find my
warrior on his knees, his neck severed and his head lying beside him. Playing
against a friend improves the game considerably, but you'll both be
struggling with your controllers instead of making planned moves and feeling
like you know what's really going on.

There's a lot of potential here, but the lack of effectively selecting and
performing the moves hampers the fun too much.

All in all, it's a noble effort that falls short of the mark.  There's a lot
of charming (and delightfully disgusting) ideas, but the execution leaves a 
bit to be desired.  With some work, this can be great game.

@NODE GAME5 "Quick Capsule Reviews"
Here are some reviews of things that don't really need an in-depth review 
done, like demos, disk-mags, etc.

ROCKO - (Amiga) - FREEWARE
This is a hilarious boxing "game" that features some digitized pictures from
a well-known boxing movie.  It's not much to play, but it does illustrate
that the Amiga is quite capable of lowering itself to play FMV type games. 
To me, I think this game sums up what most FMV type games really end up
being:  move the joystick and see what happens.  As a serious game, and I
don't think it was intended to be, it's pretty lame.  As a bit of fun, it's
pretty humorous.  The author says this is his first project in AMOS.  For a
first effort, it's not bad.

OVERALL RATING: 70%      Video Mode: PAL

@ENDNODE
  
@NODE RATINGS "The Ratings - Explained"

We judge the games we review in four different categories:

Graphics
--------
This is pretty self explanatory.  The higher the percentile, the better
the graphics are.

Sound
-----
Another no-brainer.  The higher the percentile, the better the sound. 
Although, this also relates to it's coordination with the gameplay.  If 
the sound seems inappropriate for the type of game it is, the game will
score lower in the Sound category even if the sounds are technically well
done.

Gameplay
--------
The gameplay refers to the addictive quality of the game as well as the
way the game plays.  If you find your self sitting and watching rather
than interacting with the game, the game will score lower than one that
actually involves you.

Control
-------
This refers to how easy the game is to control given the control method
specified by the manufacturer. A game requiring a special controller 
that is not specified or not included will be penalized.  A game that 
comes with a special controller or one that recommends that, say, an 
Amiga mouse might work better than the standard CD남 controller will 
not be penalized.  A game that is programmed to use a mouse when a
joystick would be much more appropriate would also be penalized.  Of
course, a game that's just plain hard to control with any control method
will also feel the sting of the rating.

@ENDNODE

@NODE LGTM "Lame Game of the Month"
This is an award presented to one game per month for being the worst of
that month's issue.  It's mainly to warn you, the consumer, about a game
that's REALLY bad.

If we have an issue with no really bad games...there'll be no award given.
A game that wins this award DESERVES to win!

@NODE NEWS1 "TEAM AMIGA Explained"
PRESS RELEASE *** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE *** PRESS RELEASE

Team AMIGA - JOIN TODAY!

What is Team AMIGA? Team AMIGA started life as a tongue-in-cheek joke in the
FidoNet AMIGA (international) echo conference, by my signing my messages as:

Ricardo.Amiga
Charter Member, Team AMIGA

It was just a fun poke in the ribs at the "other" team we all know and love
for our rival platform, the PC. I was wondering how long it would take for
someone to get a boot out of it.

Instead, all I got was inquiries like "Hey, this sounds like a great idea!
What _is_ Team AMIGA and how can I join?"

After getting tired of explaining that it was just a joke, I stepped back
and took a look at the concept. I talked it over with a few of the more
well known denizens of the AMIGA echo, and decided maybe it was a good
idea after all and not just a joke.

With almost three hundred members as of today, from Russia to Australia,
Spain to the United States and Canada, Team AMIGA is growing daily, so fast
that I have a hard time keeping up with entries to the database in my free
time.

There are no dues, there are no real "rules" (of course, it goes without
saying that software pirates and known crackers/phreakers, etc. are not
members...). There are no officers (well maybe except myself, but all I am
doing is trying to co-ordinate efforts and communicate with Amiga
Technologies, GmbH. ATG is reportedly looking very seriously at the
activities of Team AMIGA and we hope to attain a good working relationship
with them. Until these negotiations are final, we are holding off on doing
some things we really want to get busy on, like having a contest to design
a team logo, T-shirts, bumperstickers and other paraphernalia with the logo,
membership cards that we would be working with vendors to give discounts to
Team AMIGA members, etc.

Basically, Team AMIGA exists to show _our_ committment to the Amiga, as
ATGmbH has shown us. We want both to continue and thrive.

Team AMIGA is also very much _un_like another "union" that (I'm not sure
even still exists), is very demanding and makes threats to ATG saying
essentially, "You do what we want or else." Team AMIGA exists solely to
_support_ the efforts of Amiga Technologies in whatever way we can, not
bite the hand that feeds by making demands.

Below is the template that is posted in the AMIGA FidoNet echo conference,
as well as cross posted in many other networks, as well as many Internet
NewsGroups.

We hope _you_ will take the time to fill out the application and get it to
Team AMIGA!



[BEGINNING OF TEXT INSERT]

Modified: January 21, 1996

This is a regular posting in the international AMIGA echo for prospective
Team AMIGA members. Please use the template below to send in your request to
join.

Feel free to cross-post the below to other networks and services liberally!

8<---cross post beginning--cut here---8<---

In the FidoNet AMIGA echo, we've started our own "kick in the pants"
response to the PC's TEAM OS/2. It's taking off like wildfire! We'd like to
extend the invite to every Amiga devotee, everywhere! We have hundreds of
members from several countries and from Fido, Internet and on-line services.

It's free. There are no dues. There are no rules. There are no officers.
There are no idiots with a sense of pretentiousness (like CCISU or whatever
the name of that "club" for Amiga Sysops was... ;).

To join, all you have to do is:

1) Swear that you are an Amiga enthusiast who extols the virtues of the Amiga
to anyone and everyone you meet who is interested in computers (ESPECIALLY
the PC crowd! ;) and now that the Amiga's future is looking up, you'll
continue to do so even more fervently than before.

2) If you decide to join, fill out the application below and send it to me
to be added to the list, so if there are any billion dollar sweepstakes
prizes  or warehouses of Amigas to be awarded (WINK WINK, GRIN GRIN ;) ,
we'll know how to contact you. Seriously, a database is being kept and will
be forwarded to AT/Escom, should they decide to pick up the ball and run.

(Footnote: Since this all started, we do know that Amiga Technologies is
observing Team AMIGA activities closely and has expressed interest in the
near future of "officially recognizing" us.

One objective of Team AMIGA of course, was to get as many Amiga enthusiasts
worldwide to make a statement of support, but another objective, is to show
AT/Escom how much of a mistake it would be to not adequately support other
continents, like North America and Australia)

3) Always acknowledge that I am the one who started all this (hey, I want
SOME credit! (It's a JOKE, people, a JOKE! ;)

4) Know and understand that your stats will be in a database kept by me
(Rick Lembree) and _not_ released to _anyone_. If it comes to the point that
AT/Escom wants to take the ball on this, they are the _only_ ones I will
release the database to, and I will at that time ask that if they release
the database to other companies, that they be released only to AMIGA
oriented ones.

The only other thing we ask of you, is if you use the name in your on-line
signature, that you type it exactly as shown below:

                               Team AMIGA

The reason is for consistency, and for recognition. If everyone types it a
different way, it appears that we don't "have our act together".

If you agree to all the above, just send in the following information:

(Important! Please use this template as is and with ALL necessary info
requested to facilitate database entry, ok? If replying from a Fido node,
don't assume that I will have your Fido address when doing the database!
INCLUDE IT in the template! Thanks. :)

@NODE NEWS2 "Amiga 1200 Internet Bundle Details"
Here's a press release from Amiga Technologies about the Amiga 1200 Internet 
bundle:

                               Bensheim 22.01.96 

The "AMIGA Surfer" pack will hit the shelves at the end of January 1996. 

The "AMIGA Surfer" consists of an Amiga A1200HD multimedia system fitted with 
260MB hard drive and two megabytes of RAM, together with a complete suite of 
Internet software and a 14,400bps modem. The package will be priced at 
approximately USD 720 (exclusive of VAT).  This complete solution from Amiga 
Technologies is the cheapest available plug & play Internet bundle. 

The Amiga A1200 is video-compatible and can be easily connected to a 
Television set, saving the additional cost of a monitor. 

Other Internet options soon to be available from Amiga Technologies include: 
the "Surfkit", a package consisting of the Internet software suite and modem, 
at an approximate price of USD 190 (excluding VAT). A package call "Surfware" 
is also being planned which will provide the Internet software alone. 

All packs will include an option to connect to the IBM Internet Link and get 
100 hours free connection. 

About the Internet Software: 

     MUI3.2: Magic User Interface is an Amiga-OS extension that makes dedicated
     applications more ergonomic with a friendlier user interface. With MUI, 
     the user can also customise and configure their applications individually.

@NODE COL1 "Roadside Rests: An Internet Guidebook"
Roadside Rests - A "Places to Visit" Listing

The World Wide Web is one of the most interesting and exciting things to
come along in computer history.  All of a sudden, telecommunications is
not something that is divided into sysops and users.  Anyone with access to
the Internet can have a web page, as long as their Internet provider makes that 
option available to them.  

You don't need to be a computer technician to have a web page.  All you need
to be is yourself.  A web page can be as fancy or plain as you'd like to
make it.  This makes each web page as interesting and different as the people
who've created them.  The sheer variety of the types of pages available is what 
makes the World Wide Web so exciting and addicting.

Personal web pages are a lot of fun to look at.  They can make you laugh,
reflect, and realize that there are a lot of people out there sharing similar
experiences with you even though they may actually be located somewhere
that's supposedly "different."

Someone said that personal homepages are similar to the pet rocks that were
popular in the 1970's.  Everyone's got one and they're all interesting, but
we're all going to be embarassed about them in the future or something
like that.  If so, then I think we'd only being embarrassed about showing 
ourselves.  

This month, to inaugurate this column, we visit the home of the SLOB-CAM.

Rob Hudson's Home Page - http://www.whytel.com/users/rhudson/index.htm
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I stumbled upon this page while looking for web sites connected to "spy
cameras," which are, basically, cameras that are pointed at something
interesting and are connected to the Internet for all to see.  Being
something of a slob myself, a SLOB-CAM sounded interesting.  The SLOB-CAM
was supposed to be a camera that was updated every 10 minutes.  What it was
aimed at wasn't clear, but I figured it would be interesting on the name
alone. 

Upon connecting to the site, I was greeted with a large picture of a
tombstone and the message "Yes, I killed it (...and I don't even know how!)"  
The last picture that the SLOB-CAM transmitted was of the obviously 
disgruntled operator of the site, Rob Hudson.  The self-deprecating humor 
found in the account of the death of the SLOB-CAM struck me as quite similar 
to my own.

A link to Rob's personal page at the Why? Network took my to one of the most
entertaining pages I've seen in my short time on the Web.

You can read all about Rob, visit a tribute to his hometown of Odessa,
Texas, take a look at his Shostakovich Resource Directory, read one of his
English papers and a lot more.

I won't spoil it for you, but point your browser at Rob's page for a
sarcastic look at life as he knows it.  It's one of the best homepages on
the web, in my opinion.

Any of these dealers can process your Amiga order.  If your local dealer
does not appear on the list, encourage them to sign up.

Dealer Sign-up:  Dealers can request an application by faxing their request
to the SMG at (410) 992-9979 or (410) 715-6859.  Make your request on company
letterhead.  Be sure to include your name, address, telephone and fax numbers.

Dealers can contact us via phone at (410) 715-6850,  via Fax at (410) 992-9979
or (410) 715-6850,  via Internet email at pbielski@interramp.com, or  via
CompuServe mail at 72060,3271.

[Ed note:  The next issue of AEM will hopefully have detailed information on
selected dealers.  Or, we could continue to run the SMG list.  Your thoughts
are welcome.  Let us know what you'd rather see.]

@NODE HOWTO "How to get listed in the AEM Dealer Listing"

If you're an Amiga dealer or CD남 dealer, big or small, please send
us your business' name, address, telephone number and fax number to be
listed here.  We'd like to provide our readership with a list of places
where accessories and software can be found.

Readers are also encouraged to submit dealer information.  With the Amiga
community in danger of losing dealers, we need to know where to find one
when we need one.  Support your local Amiga dealer!  (The prices may not
always be as low as mail order, but the service is face-to-face and
they'll really appreciate it!)

We can be reached via the Internet, FIDONet Netmail or US Mail.

@NODE NEXT "What's coming in the next issue?"

This issue is a bit on the thin side, admittedly.  

We need your help, Amiga fans!  If you've got some game reviews, news or an
article you feel would be of interest to Amiga owners, send it to us for
publication! 

I'm not quite sure what will specifically be in the next issue, yet.  It all 
depends on the reaction to this issue.

For sure, there will a continuation of the Roadside Rests column.  And, of
course, more game reviews.  (Which shouldn't be too hard, since there was
only one full review in this issue!)

Look for the next issue on, or about, March 1, 1996!
