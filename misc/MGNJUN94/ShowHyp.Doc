As you might have seen, April has a manual in hypertext (.guide format).
This format can be read from a normal reader, but because of the codes
used in HyperText it will be confusing.
ShowHyp reads the guide and shows the Hypertext without codes in it's
window.

ShowHyp will not read the entire document in memory, but only small
pieces of text (nodes). ShowHyp creates an index file, so the next
time you use it, almost no loading is required.

ShowHyp will remember the size and place of its window.


HyperText gives you the possibility to get some words in a text more
explained. Also a handy index makes it easier to find a piece of
text in a big manual.


ShowHyp has 4 gadgets in it's window:

 Contents  -  ShowHyp will jump to the previous contents.
 Retrace   -  Jump to your previous selection.
 Browse <  -  ShowHyp jumps one node (text-part) back.
 Browse >  -  ShowHyp jumps one node (text-part) further.

RMB->LMB has the same function as the Retrace gadget.
(RightMouseButton->...)

Scrolling with cursor or keypad or RMB above/below middle of window.

Use the Close gadget or right mousebutton outside window to quit.



That's all... Enjoy HyperText-reading with ShowHyp!
