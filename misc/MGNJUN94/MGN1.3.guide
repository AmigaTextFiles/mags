@{b}Words from MGN's Gadfly Artiste and Editroid
by Dave Matthews@{ub}

This issue of MGN is an abbreviated special rumour issue. Check out the
Infobahn section for all the latest rumours from the nets. Aas I write
this, there has been no concrete news on the fate of the Amiga. For
awhile, everyone was hollering about Sony, then Samsung was reported to
have bought the Amiga while Phillips was said to have bought the CD32
technology. Now the nets report that some kind of "consortium" with 3
ASIAN companies (SONY, SAMSUNG and Matsushita?) have bought Commodore.

I hope that this is resolved soon, as even if someone does buy out
Commodore, long legal wrangles and delays will kill any chance the Amiga
has of bouncing back. Apple and the PC Clone makers continue to cut
prices, and the PowerPC Mac and Pentium systems are raising the ante for
personal computers. If the Amiga is to survive, even as a niche machine,
SOMEONE has to move quickly.

                                    ***


Ever notice how testy people can be? One of the big attractions of the
InfoBahn is reading and sending messages to people all over the world.
You can find message areas (also known as conferences, echoes etc) that
cover virtually any topic imaginable, from computers to gardening to sex
and every other human activity.

If you participate for very long, however, you're sure to run into the
seamy side of being online- the flame. A flame occurs when someone
decides that some message poster is wrong, and feels obligated to let
the online community know so. Of course, the person who has been flamed
must then defend their position, and in the course of doing so, usually
raise the ante a notch or too. You can guess the results of this, as the
messages escalate from mildly insulting to outright vicious personal
assaults.

The sad/funny thing about this is how trivial the original subject matter
for a lot of these flames is. It doesn't take wildly controversial
subjects for a heated flame war. I've seen them start over spelling and
punctuation!

It's as if being online strips the thin veneer of civility we've acquired
in order to function as a society, rather than a mob. I suppose both the
immediacy of being online and the insular quality of faceless
communication contributes to this.

Another interesting phenom on the nets are Rants and Raves. These range
from facetious fun-poking to serious bent paranoid conspiracy rambles.
I'll bet that the Infobahn leads to a whole new volume in the socio-
psychological studies area.

                                    ***

One final note, I have been toying with the idea of an MGN cover disk.
This would include more illustrations and screen shots, possibly a PD,
shareware or otherwise freely distributable program, or demo, and any
other odd thing I might dream up. Any interest in this? I'm not sure
how it would be distributed, but I'd probably charge a couple bucks for
each issue. Just something to think about.

NEW YORK, April 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Commodore International Limited (NYSE:
CBU) announced today that its Board Of Directors has authorized the
transfer of its assets to trustees for the benefit of its creditors and
has placed its major subsidiary, Commodore Electronics Limited, into

Commodore Folds
By DINAH WISENBERG BRIN
Associated Press Writer
@{ub}
WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) -- Commodore International Ltd., a pioneer in the
personal computer industry, said late Friday it is going out of business.

The company plans to transfer its assets to unidentified trustees
"for the benefit of its creditors" and has placed its major subsidiary,
Commodore Electronics Ltd., into voluntary liquidation.

"This is the initial phase of an orderly voluntary liquidation of both
companies," Commodore said in a brief statement.

Company executives could not immediately be reached Friday evening.

The company last month reported an $8.2 million loss for the quarter
ending Dec. 31 on sales of $70.1 million. A year earlier, Commodore lost
$77.2 million on sales of $237.7 million in the same period.

In the latest report, Commodore said financial limits had thwarted its
ability to supply products, leading to weakened sales. One of its new
products, the Amiga CD32 video game, had sold poorly in Europe, where the
company did most of its business.

@{b} EDITORS NOTE: Somebody is lying about this. Whether earlier reports
of CD32's success were grossly exaggerated by CBM, or they are lying now,
for whatever weasely financial reasons in this statement I don't know.
@{ub}
The company's net worth turned negative in the fiscal year ended last June
30.

Its stock, which had traded at around $3 per share before the quarterly
results were announced last month, closed unchanged at 87 1/2 cents per
share on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.

"This is a company that briefly captured the attention of the American
market and didn't go where the market was going," said David Coursey,
editor of the newsletter P.C. Letter in San Mateo, Calif. "They just never
managed to change with the marketplace."

While grabbing some market share and attention in the late 1970s,
Commodore's products were something between PCs and game machines "and
never quite became either," Coursey said.

@{b} EDITORS NOTE: There they go again. Late 70's? Just another attempt to
ignore the Amiga. Say what you want about Commodore, but I'm glad they
didn't "go with the marketplace" and turn the Amiga into just another
clone. The Amiga's lack of mass success is undeniable, but compare the
money Apple spent promoting and developing the Mac to the money CBM spent
promoting and developing the Amiga, and I think you'll see that:

A: The Amiga was not the "miserable failure" John Dvorak and others
   have called it. Think about it- the Mac has sold only about 12 million
   units, with far better marketing, bigger research and development
   budgets, and much more support from the industry.

B: Commodore did not fail to "go with the marketplace". If anything,
   They failed to understand just how unique and superior the Amiga was.
   Commodore treated the Amiga like just another clone, and never once
   really grasped themselves what the Amiga was, so it isn't too
   surprising that they were unable to market the Amiga effectively.
@{ub}
Commodore started 40 years ago as a typewriter repair company in the Bronx.
Its extension to the adding machine business paved the way for it to make
calculators and then personal computers by the mid-1970s.

Commodore competed with Radio Shack for the first computers sold to homes
and co-founder Jack Tramiel became a highly-regarded figure in the
fledgling PC industry.

By the early 1980s, it was overshadowed in the PC business by Apple
Computer Inc. and IBM. Software manufacturers didn't create as much
software for Commodore's Amiga line as it did for Apple and IBM-
compatible machines.

In recent years, most of Commodore's business was in Europe.

NewTek Inc. of Topeka, Kan., created a product called Video Toaster that
converted Commodore's Amiga to a video-editing system. The $2,500 product
was popular with small advertising agencies and home hobbyists. The
company's phones were busy Friday night.

@{b} EDITORS NOTE: I'm sure NBC and the SeaQuest People will be thrilled
to be considered as home hobbyists. Not to mention Babylon 5, Star Trek 6,
Robocop, etc.

@{b}Flying Toasters..er...Toaster Flyers@{ub}

Amidst wild speculation at the NAB (Nation Broadcasters) convention,
NewTek announced the Toaster Flyer. The Flyer is a non-linear editor
system based on NewTek's proprietary video compression scheme, VTASC,
(Video Toaster Adaptive Statistical Coding), and is supposed to provide
excellent video compression without the nasty artifacts of system using
JPEG compression. Quality of the image can be sacrificed for greater
video storage, depending on the needs of the user.

The basic process is to record video straight to your hard drive, then
using the Flyer's graphical software, you arrange your video clips in
any order you want, adding Toaster effects, titles etc.

The Flyer also features support for multiple tracks of CD quality sound,
so it is a complete solution for the high end video producer.

Price for the Video Flyer is $3995, Toaster 4000 system not included. Of
course, you also need BIG FAST hard drives; don't even consider less than
a gigabyte.

The Toaster Flyer is expected to ship by fall.



@{b}Play it Again...No Wait, Play a New One, Sam!@{ub}

Paul Montgomery, and about a dozen other NewTekians, including <GASP>
the one and only Pipi Longstocking...er...I mean...Kiki Stockhammer, have
left NewTek to form a company called Play. Rumour has it they intend to
create some kind of "Toaster Killer" for IBM PC compatibles. Hmmmm.



@{b}Screamer Wrapped or Raptor Screams@{ub}

Replacing the short lived Screamer will be the Raptor, designed by Desk
Station Technology. The Raptor is a Lightwave renderer based on MIPS 
R4400 Risc Processors. Rather than the Screamers four CPUs, the Raptor
contains two, which still purports to be ten times as fast as an Amiga
4000 at rendering Lightwave frames. The unit at NAB was housed in a
nasty black case, resembling nothing so much as a furnace. I hate it.

Retail Price is set at about $15,000, which includes 128 MB of RAM. I
hope they put the production models back in the screamer case, I really
liked that one; not that I have much chance of being a Raptor owner...



@{b}NewTek finds themselves a little TOO generous?@{ub}

Word has it NewTek was a little over generous in the free demo videotape
department. Apparently they are in a lil bit of doodoo over this.
On the other hand, look for a slew of new products to hit the market, as
NewTek repositions themselves to keep the revolution alive.

Commodore is NOT DEAD and neither is the Amiga. Call it a miracle, or 
whatever you like, but it's TRUE.

Look, I just called Commodore Germany and was told that the european 
operations were not affected by the American liquidation. "Things are just 
fine over here in Frankfurt, thank you". I called four different people to 
make sure that the information is accurate (yes, I speak german).  I know 
some of these people personnaly, I worked at Commodore Germany a few years 
ago, and am concerned in spreading reliable information from reliable 
sources, so please, do not flame this information as rumours,  it is REAL.

Commodore currently only gives information by phone, untill everything is 
cleared up.

Commodore US HAD to be liquidated because they found an investor who is 
willing to inject enough cash to startup Commodores business again. They 
won't tell at this time who actually bought them up, this will be done 
later in an official press announcement. It is also not sure what sort of 
agreement was reached between them, if it's a joint venture, a 
participation in Commodores capital or a complete takeover.

What I can tell you, is that the buyer is a big asian investor who has  
enough financial power to restart Commodore and who is willing to keep  
the Amiga product line alive.

The american structure WILL be maintained, all devellopment comes from 
there. The recent layoffs are the results of the liquidation. There are 
good chances that many of these employees will be hired back when the 
storm is over. No clear statement, though. 

Production is still halted and restarting it is not a problem at all. 

The names "Commodore" and "Amiga", as well as the product line will be 
maintanined and supported in the future.

There will be *no layoffs* at Commodore Germany.

Alwin Stumpf (GEO of C= Germany) was in England on Saturday at a general 
meeting where these issues were discussed. I phoned with him last week 
(can't be reached today, unfortunately, you will understand why, actually 
it was a real pain to get through the busy phone lines today) and he 
mainly gave me informations about what was going to happen with  Commodore 
in France.

The main point in the negociations in GB were that the name Commodore and 
the product Amiga had to be maintained. They succeeded in avoiding an 
"Amiga slaughtering takeover".

They found a way to acomplish this needed liquidation of C= US and all 
non-rentable subsidiaries (C= France, C= Spain, C= Belgium) without 
suspending the operations of C= Germany, C= Italy, C= GB and C= 
Scandinavia.

Commodore France will be replaced by a new company called "Amiga Computer-

export SARL", which will have an office in Paris. Developper and dealer 
support as well as marketing and distribution will be their main activity. 
This subsidiary  of Commodore Germany will have a lighter structure than 
former Commodore France and will be 100% Amiga oriented, unlike C= France 
who was too much PC oriented and who didn't survive the loss of the clone 
market.

 NJM> Yes this is the end.

No, it's a new beginning.

 NJM> For the first time CBM made a headline on Compuserve!

There will be more opportunities for them to make headlines soon, believe 
me.

Feel free to phone or mail me for further informations, the lines are 
buzzing and I'll be back with more info as soon as available.

Okay guys, I've got what you can call an email flood here.

Sorry if I cannot respond to you personnaly, I will however post the last 
news from TODAY,

04 May 1994. 21H30 CET.

Well Peter Kittel is not working at commodore currently but don't panic, 
he hasn't been fired, he is just having some vacation and is quite busy 
because he just bought a new car.

I'm talking about him because I know that all of you MUST know who Peter 
Kittel is. Maybe this will give more credibility to what I post, since 
some people are still sceptic (I don't blame them). Well Peter is not 
working currently but he is phoning every day to stay tuned. He came to 
the office on Monday, because his boss asked him to call most of the 
german develloppers to give them the information I gave you the same day. 
So, when you will read this, I think that many others will be able to 
confirm my statements.

Now, you can trust in this.

So, I called Peter home tonight and asked him for the latest infos.

Well, things haven't changed much. But It is now definitly done,  
Commodore has been bought by a big asian company whose name is still 
unknown.

The Amiga product line in its entire range will be maintained. Confirmed.

Commodore will not become a console maker, the CD32, though, as part of 
the line will still be produced and supported.

No informations about Mehdi Ali and Irvin Gould. Are they still there ? 
Both of them held about 50 % of the Commodore shares and therefore, an 
agreement must have been reached with them.

Peter doesn't know who is the buyer, honnestly. He doesn't even have 
clues. Alwin Stumpf didn't tell anything, he just said that thing about  
the "big asian investor, something of the size of Sony (this is NOT a 
clue).

To americans : It is very doubtful that Commodore will stop its activities 
in the USA. All developpment comes from there. There are about 25 people 
left in West chester, many have been laid off. It is quite possible 
though, that some of them will come back when the storm is over.

Commodore is a huge nebulous organization, previously made of about 35 
single companies, of which 5, namely Commodore Electronics limited, 
Commodore Intl., C= France, C= Spain and C= Belgium have been liquidated. 
That leaves about 30 more to embarass you with their marketing strategy ;-
). The development team for hardware is a company, there are separate 
companies for almost everything at commodore, even the coffee brewing team 
has its own structure ;-).

Don't you remember that message from Dave Haynie, where he told that he's 
been working in 3 or 4 different companies since he's at CBM,  without 
moving away from his desk ?

That's why many of the speculations you read about Commodores future were 
FALSE (-MB-). It's just impossible to make financial speculations about a 
company where even the employees don't exactly know how it's run. This 
might be annoying, but a last, it is also the reason why a good surprise 
was still possible. Commodore is nothing to speculate with.

Commodore will not make any WRITTEN announcements, this includes the net, 
they are only giving informations by phone, until every remaining details 
are cleared up. You will have to live with that for the coming fortnight 
(10-12 days, to be more precise). Commodore US will not make any comments, 
they don't even answer the phone anymore, as I was told (understandable 
but not very cool for emotional people).

On the other hand, CBM germany is quite eager to give informations by 
phone, so just call them, if you speak german.

What you just read is not a stolen information Commodore would have liked 
to keep secret. You read this because Commodore wants you to. Take it as 
an oral announcement.

please no flames or garbage.

OKay, that's all for now.

 * Original message dated 29 Apr 94, from Traveler Ltd.

A few things need to be sorted out re: several misconceptions regarding
Commodore, it's structure, it's demise, the layoffs and the like. I realize
that trying to inject reality into the .misc and .advocacy groups is a
short, true path to insanity but here it goes...

First, the layoffs ...

 1. Last Friday (April 22) approx 15 people were let go from West Chester.
    These included the person doing the payroll.

 2. Last Friday Commodore Semiconductor Group was (finally) closed and
    the approx 15 people there were let go.

 3. Last Friday, the "rumor" (it turned out to be fact) was that this week
    ("tuesday or wednesday" was the common wisdom) engineering would follow
    in their footsteps.

 4. On Tuesday (April 26, the engineers who would not be there the next
    day (for whatever reasons) were told that they were history and not to
    worry about coming back.

 5. On Tuesday, plans were laid for a big "lunch party" at Margarita's (the
    semi-official CBM watering hold where many "after layoffs" and "going
    away" parties have been held over the years.)

 5. On Wednesday the expected layoffs occurred. Over 50 people were at the
    party (including yours truly) and much was said about what is and
    isn't real about the current situation. More on that later.

 6. Remaining at CBM are :

  Software :

   Allan Havemose (department head)
   David Junod
   Eric Cotton

  Hardware :

      Jeff Frank (department head)
      Dave Haynie
      Greg Berlin
      Fred Bowen

 CATS

  Carolyn Scheppner
  Wayne Lutz

  (John Campbell, head of CATS, was let go)

 LSI

  Ted Lenthe (department head)
  Jeff Dean
  Rich Llewellyn
  (and two more I can't remember - sorry guys)

 Other engineering folks remaining:

  Ian Kirschemann (assistant to Jeff Frank)
  Dan Faust (lab tech)

  Lew Eggebrecht

  ('m sure I'm missing a couple.)

There are also a couple of non-engineering folks remaining like one person
in personnel, etc. The total is about 22 according to those at the lunch.

Now Commodore...

There is no difference between the US operations and the UK or German
operations. None. They all get machines designed and engineeried by the
folks at West Chester. The phrase "U.S. Operations" refers to the US sales
and mareting departments, just as "U.K. operations" refers to the sales
and marketing departments in the UK. It does _not_ refer to engineering
nor Commodore Internation Ltd. (CIL) which was "the business". CIL was
nuked completely last Friday.

The notion that "the U.S. company is going down the tubes but the U.K. will
save things" is a total, complete fantasy. Won't happen. In fact, the U.S.
sales company has been history for some time now. I guess no one bothered
to consult with the net about it (G) .

At the Wednesday lunch the information came out that

  1. There are only 3 people remaining in the U.K. operation.

  2. There are only 2 people remaining in the German operation.

  3. There are only 3 people at the Phillipines manufacturing plant
     (which is closed, by the way)

  4. All the other companies, world wide, have been, or are being,
     "liquidated".

  4. The subject of the Canadian company never came up but I would have
     to assume that it's no better off than the UK company.

The remaining staff (almost all engineering) believes that they are being
kept till the last possible minute in order to keep the sale of the
technology as attractive as possible to prospective buyers. There would
still be people available to hand off the technology. However, one of the
(remaining) managers, when asked point blank "how much longer does it
really have?" replied "oh, two to three weeks." The problem with this
proposed sale of the technologies is that it's hard to them to separate out
parts of the company to sell because so many creditors want their share.
Mariott is still owed approx $350,000 for last year's Devcon, for example.

These notions that "the UK will become the base of the new operations" and
that "CBM is moving there" is complete BS. As Mr. Barrett correctly pointed
out, few, if any, of the remaining staff would move there - especially not
to work for Mehdi (would you???). Also, the company can't afford to make
ONE machine, much less move people to England and make enough to support
the staff. They are not paying severance pay to those they lay off.

In reference to several things said over the past couple of days :

 >I just ping'd Dave Haynie's workstation, and it was alive as of 10 minutes
 >ago.

Pinging machines inside CBM doesn't mean a thing. The hardware could be
left on for weeks with no one there to use them. Also, whenever there are
layoffs like this, the systems are shut down for a period of time to
prevent reprisals from unhappy employees. Once the ex-employees' accounts
are fixed to kill their access, the machines come back on-line.

 >The company intends to continue operations overseas with the UK becoming
 >the primary office.

If this is so, was the office always just three people? Does this represent

The Windows NT Amiga thing was _never_ more than a pipe dream of Misters

You've been into the weed again, haven't you? Or just spending too much
time with Jim Drew. Man, oh man. Who the hell do you think MAKES Amigas?
Geez.

Harv's posting about his phone conversation with the CBM employees paints
an accurate picture (which I must admit surprised me a bit :))

I will be attending the "death vigil party" (as Randell calls it - he
called to invite me yesterday) this weekend. It should be interesting.
Quite a few ex engineering folks are going to be there (Bryce, Lauren
Brown, Andy ...)

Anyway, all you folks out there who desire to cling to your hopes, dreams
and fantasies, well ...

Dear CEI Dealer:
As we have been expecting, Commodore International filed for liquidation in
order to be protected from its creditors Friday April 29, 1994, at 4:10
P.M. Commodore's official statment follows:
        "Commodore International Limited announced today that its Board of
Directors has authorized the transfers of its asstes to trustees for the
benefit of its creditor and has placed its major subsidiary, Commodore
Electronics Limited, into voluntary liquidation. This is the initial phase
of an orderly liquidation of both companies, which are incorporated in the
Bahamas, by the Bahamas Supreme Court."

        This action does not affect the wholly-owned subsidiaries which
include Commodore Buisiness machines (USA), Commodore Buisiness Machines
LTD (CANADA), Commodore/Amiga (UK), Commodore Germany, etc. Operations will
continue normally. 

        CEI has been working closely with Commodore's management and major
investors to find a resolution to the current financial crisis. Commodore's
actions now clear the way for PROGRESS to be made.

        In the next few weeks CEI will be making a number of important
announcements.

        CEI currently has suffcient Amiga inventory to meet expected demand
until manufacturing can be resumed. All our policies remina intact, full
service and support will continue. If you have any questions or concerns
please contact your CEI representative.

        Please assure your cutomers that this event should be seen in a
positive light. What if...better support, better products, better
marketing, better prices, better margins all arose from the ashes. Stay
tuned


        Sincerely,

And finally :

C= UK and GERMANY can't do anything about this, they will be sold as
'assets' of CBM...

Philips will probably (not confirmed) buy the CD32 technology.

There is still hope for the AMiga, NewTek and Scala are told to be
interested.

Brief :  C= is gone, dead, over and out.. We can only hope that soemone
         will take over the Amiga and continue development...

Well, for all of you who were mad because I was one of the gajillions of 
people who posted the same CBM press releases for the 36th time, here's a 
bit of news that at least will have different wording.

This particular tidbit comes from the Microtech BBS in suburban Chicago.  
Microtech is an Amiga shop that primarily specializes retailing Toaster 
systems.  They have about as up-to-date info as anyone.

The following is transcribed:


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

News Bulletin: Amiga Continues!
(Fri  6-May-1994  5:33p)

Here is the latest news from our COMMODORE REPRESENTATIVE (not BBS or the
usual rumour mill):

As of 4:00PM Friday, May 6, Commodore was purchased by Samsung, who has every
intention of continuing the Amiga line of hardware as we have all hoped.
The Amiga will survive! Press releases with more details will probably appear
in the next few days.

The separate division of Commodore which manufactures CD-32 has been purchased
by Philips. It is not known at this time if Philips will continue CD-32
production at all, or if the CD-32 technology will simply be absorbed into
their own CDI product line. Again, time will tell.

Personally, I expect CD-32 to simply vanish, and the Philips CDI machine will
suddenly get more powerful.....

Stay tuned... As we hear OFFICIAL announcements, we'll post them.



Halelujah!  Looks like I'll be buying that Amiga in September after all!

I work at a LARGE computer chain (CompUSA), within the last week (since
Commodore's DEATH) we can now order the Commodore Amiga 3000UX Unix system. 
Since Commodore's existance, this WASN'T possible.  BUT, since we can now
special order this Amiga, be looking for Amiga's in a store near you --->
hopefully soon!  
 
Just thought I'd present something of good news! The Amiga itself is very much
alive!!!!

            AmigaWorld--The Leading Amiga Publication--
          Reinforces Position of Strong Support in Market

Peterborough, NH (May 3, 1994)  AmigaWorld, the independent, monthly
consumer publication for users of Amiga personal computers, has announced
today that recent events at Commodore Business Machines in no way affect
AmigaWorld's commitment to the market.

Responding to news on Friday, April 29, that Commodore was going out of
business, AmigaWorld Editor-in-Chief Daniel Sullivan stated, "Regardless
of any change in the status of Commodore's operations, AmigaWorld will
continue to provide coverage of the Amiga market for its readership.  We
believe there are sound reasons to remain in the Amiga market -- namely,
an installed base of five million Amiga computers worldwide; a dedicated
AmigaWorld readership of loyal, enthusiastic users; and an innovative,
proactive group of third-party developers."

Sullivan added, "We also feel certain that the technology will survive
the liquidation of Commodore through licensing agreements with interested
third parties -- of which there appear to be many. This is an excellent
opportunity for the Amiga community to take charge of its own destiny and
set a direction for further development that Commodore has not been able
to provide."

The AmigaWorld staff views this situation as an opportunity to provide an
even greater level of service to its readers and advertisers. With
Commodore's departure from the market, customer service will become an
even greater priority at AmigaWorld.  The staff will continue to support
everyone involved in the market through such means as phone support and
on-line feedback. By providing strong customer service and up-to-date
market coverage for readers, AmigaWorld hopes to be the catalyst for
future growth and development in the Amiga community.

AmigaWorld Magazine is published by TechMedia Publishing, Inc., an
International Data Group company. IDG is the world's foremost publisher
of computer-related information and the leading global provider of
information services on information technology, with over 194 computer
publications in 62 countries.

Attention Amiga developers and interested parties...

After speaking with Mike Levin (CSM hall of fame) tonight on CIS (and via
the phone), we have come to several conclusions about possible solutions
to a panic'd public and potential loss of the most powerful home computer
made to date (that's the Amiga folks).  He suggested that I lead the
attempt to purchase the rights to the Amiga hardware.  Rights that would
be purchased by all parties and made available to all parties.

I would like to hear from developers who would be interested in still
developing for the Amiga, or anyone who would like to support this effort
in general.

People can think what they want of me, my statements, my comments... to
me, that's been very good to see... my corporation, my products, and my-
self have been changed a lot from the responses I have seen here, GEnie,
and on CompuServe.  My persistance has paid off.  Because of EMPLANT's
success, I will never have to work another day in my life.

I am willing to put everything on the line.  I believe in this machine,
the platform, and the people (even though we bicker like a bunch of old
hens sometimes).  On behalf of the Amiga's continued existance, I am ask-
ing for your support.  Let's all make some noise about the Amiga.
Commodore kept it the best computing secret of all time, I think it's time
to let the cat of the bag.

I will be in contact with ALL of the major 3rd party Amiga peripheral
corporations tomorrow, also asking for their support.  If we can somehow
form a public corporation and obtain the rights to the Amiga hardware, we
can make the Amiga work.

My goals for this project are...

Obtain information concerning current ownership rights of the Amiga
hardware design, and other important peripherals.  From what information I
have heard (and have had gathered by nosey attorneys), the rights were
transferred to 'trustees' for holding.  If this is true, there very well
may be some interesting legal problems involved here, since the technology
behind the Amiga is the only real asset that Commodore Intl had left...
that would leave an empty shell for the creditors to pick through.

Purchase the rights from current ownership, or work with another
corporation to see that continued development and *gasp* advertising is
done.

Contact major MAC and PC developers (Adobe, Aldus, etc.) and once again
offer to port their products to the Amiga at little or no cost.  Once
people see *us* running the big boys software more efficiently than other
platforms can, they will think hard before buying that next MAC or PC
system.

Continued developer support.  I plan to have CATS revived, and I hope that
Carolyn and the rest of the original team will be interested in doing
this.

Continued devlopment of new machines.  One thing I have learned in
producing hardware is how to cut costs.  EMPLANT is cheap to make... and
it is *still* made in the US (this is important to me).  Another thing I
learned is that the short time I spent talking with Dave Haynie, he is
alright in my book.  We chatted for about 30 minutes at one of the WOC
shows, and he is as sincere about the continued development as I am.  I
definately want Dave and the original crew back working together.  I
would hate to see a bunch of new comers (I am not oppose to new ideas
brought out by new people), but right now we need a dedicated team going
to get things done in a flash.  New people come with success.

Remove the poor publicity.  The only advertising Commodore got was bad.
Dealers wanted to kill them... developers wanted to kill them.. all due to
the poor management. The only way to do this is to rid the Commodore name.

So you're asking "what's in it for Jim?".  Gratification.  As I stated
before, I could wash my hands clean of this situation and walk.  I don't
want to.  There is a pile of money to be made for everyone, and more
importantly a computer to be saved from extinction.  I know a lot of Amiga
developers have made themselves rich with the Amiga, and some would like
to forget it... I think that is selfish.  I for one, am willing to give
back to what made me where I am today.

So, in closing, I would like to thank those people who have sent me
incouragement letters, and even hate mail.  :-)  I am stubborn (I think
you'll *all* agree on this one... perhaps a usenet first?) and I can use
this to our advantage, obtain the rights to the machine, make these
rights publically available (anyone could produce the machine ala PC
clones), and see this thing through... or I'll end up on the street
trying...

If you are a developer, no matter how small and you have an interest in
supporting the Amiga, please FAX my office (602) 453-6407  (we have boxes
of fax paper).  If we do not succeed in obtaining the rights to the Amiga,
and someone else does... a huge list of developers wanting to support the
platform would be a big incentive to keep the product alive. I really
don't care who makes the machine, as long as it is made (and promoted
this time around).

Thanks for your attention,

Sincerely,

Review by Dave Matthews@{ub}
@{ub}
While the diehard Amiga owners sit on the edge of their seats, (and the
rats abandon the sinking ship), C64 and C128 owners can sail on, nearly
oblivious to the troubles at Commodore. After all, what has Commodore done
for the 8-bit owners lately?

We have always had to look elsewhere for support, and let's face it, even
if Samsung, or whomever, decides to buy out Commodore, there won't be any
real benefit for the C64 and C128 anyway.

So, relax, pat your trusty 8-bit, and carry on with one of the most
enjoyable computers ever released.

One good way to do just that is Loadstar. Approaching it's ten year
anniversary (think about that- ten years in the computer industry is just
about forever), Loadstar continues to publish four disk sides (about
700,000 bytes) every issue. That may not sound like much to an Amiga, IBM
or Mac, but that's a lot of material in C64 terms.

One thing I really like about Loadstar, and about the people who publish
it, is their integrity. Time and time again I've been burned by Magazine
publishers who feel that just because you pay for a product, does not
actually entitle you to receive that product.

Loadstar has a rock solid guarantee- they give you every issue you pay for!
The fact that this is such a radical and uncommon practice tells us quite
a bit about the publishing and computer industries.

Issue #119, as usual, has a mix of programs, artwork and text. Starting in
the Loadstar files, Fender expounds on practical matters and Jeff waxes
philosophical. Zero page has articles on how to convert Text between
Loadstar's 37 column PetAscii and The Write Stuff's 40/80 column screen
code format.

The continuing GeoPhytes column by Ryan Hidalgo covers using geoWrite,
as well as using a REU (RAM Expansion Unit) with GEOS. Fender also notes
that the entire line of Commodore GEOS products have been "bought" from
GeoWorks by CMD. CMD will continue to sell and support all GEOS products,
which is a boon indeed to all 8-bitters.

In the bits column, Roger Gouin, the programmer behind the Max Viewer,
(more on Max Viewer later), tells all about the C64 and its display
modes.

Fender Tucker also reviews Pogo, the new Commercial "Lode Runner" type
game by Maurice Yanney.

Moving right along to Brainware, we find Marc Walter's Word Mix, a slide-
the tiles word game, Roger Norton's History Challenge III, and of course
Barbara Schulak long running Puzzle Page, (the annual Crossword puzzle
issue) as well as another puzzle by her, Coded Crossword.

The Funware section is replete with Mystical Diamonds, a game that
entails moving marbles around diamonds till everything just "clicks
into place."

Utility Ware features Big Screen, by Jeff Jones, a programming utility to
help you make giant scrolling backgrounds for your games, and List One,
which "steps" through program listings one line at a time.

Steller Astronomer, by Frederick J. Barnett, Jr. starts off the Help Ware
section. This educational program will tell you all about those "points
of light" up there.

Steve Emsley returns with 20 more "patches" to make those pesky commercial
games easier to win:

 Break It             Hunter/Killer
 Crazy Balloon        Jail Break
 Crazy Cars           Perplexian Chal
 Dragon Hawk          Puffy's Saga
 Dragon Fire          Saracen
 Eagle Empire         Skate Crazy
 Evolution            Skull
 Flight 64            Slurpy
 Fortress/Witch King  Threshold
 Ghost Chaser         Zix

In the Grafix Ware column, we find Max-Viewer. This mighty program can
display scrollable super large page sized black and white graphics as fast
as lightning. The really amazing thing about this is it's all done in text
mode! Roger Gouin, the programmer, also shares his programming knowledge
of the the C64 and graphics. One of the pictures included is the beatiful
MacPaint Nude Woman on Zebra picture. I suppose there are those out there
who may find this picture offensive, which is yet another reason I like
Loadstar- they're not afraid to take a chance now and again.

Also included on this issue are the winners of the Loadstar Prose Quest
'93 writing contest, as well as Jeff Jones' BookMeister, a program to
make digital "books" for the 64. First Kill, by Frederick J. Barnett Jr.
is about a young man's reaction to killing his first deer. Omaha, by Wayne
Faust, is a sort of time travel story with a really nasty twist,and Babie,
by David Moorman is a story about robots. Pretty good reading. I hope
Fender and Heff continue to include fiction with Loadstar.

So what if Commodore dies? We've got Loadstar.
