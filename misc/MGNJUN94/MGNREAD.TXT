Micro Guerrilla News is an AmigaGuide (hypertext) format newsletter,
covering the Commodore Amiga, Commodore 64, and (off and on) other
computers.

To read this file you must have either AmigaGuide, Multiview or some other
guide viewer program, such as Nick de.Jong's ShowHyp (included).


                   IF YOU DO HAVE AMIGAGUIDE OR MULTIVIEW
                   --------------------------------------

If you have AmigaGuide or MultiView installed, just click on the MGN icon.
MGN as shipped is setup for AmigaGuide. In order to use MultiView you
need to change the tool type setting of the icon. Click on the ICON, then
select INFORMATION under the ICONS MENU. In the information window, click
in the text box labeled TOOL TYPES. Type in the MULTIVIEW. If you have
moved MULTIVIEW somewhere other than SYS:Utilities, you may need to
specify the complete path, i.e. WORK:Pictures/MultiView for example.

Now and again, MGN will have illustrations, screen shots, photos etc,
included. These are standard iff files, and so you will need some kind of
IFF viewer, such as Viewtek, Mostra or Commodore's Display or Multiview
installed on your system. I have included a script (display.mgn) for this
purpose which will tell the AmigaGuide viewer program what program it 
should look for to view the pictures. It will find most of the popular
viewers and look in most of the obvious places, but if you click on a
button to view an image and nothing happens, it probably couldn't find a
viewer. In which case you may need to either edit the script (which is
beyond the scope of this read me file) or just use whatever picture viewer
or paint program you do have.

This script, by the way, is based on David Tiberio's script that was
included with Issue 2.15 of Amiga Report. Amiga Report is another (the
original?) AmigaGuide format newsletter, now edited by Robert Niles and has
inspired many other people (including me) to create these "online
magazines." Amiga Report is probably available where you got MGN
from. Issue 2.15 has an article on writing AmigaDOS scripts by David
Tiberio if your interested in learning more.


                 IF YOU DON'T HAVE AMIGAGUIDE OR MULTIVIEW
                 -----------------------------------------

I've included ShowHyp v1.2, by Nick de.Jong, which seems to work on all
Amigas with at least version 1.3 of the OS. To use this, you must use the
CLI. Open a shell window, cd to the drawer or disk where you have
Micro Guerrilla News, and type:

showhyp MGN1.2.guide

This will display Micro Guerrilla News in the ShowHyp window. At the top of
the screen are four boxes: Contents, Retrace, <Browse, and Browse<. These
allow you to navigate through the newletter. Contents shows the table of
contents for a particular section, Retrace brings you back to the previous
section, and the browse buttons are for skimming forward and backward
through the text. The words enclosed in boxes can be clicked on, and will
take you to the appropriate section of text.

Unfortunately, ShowHyp does not like some of the AmigaGuide formatting
commands, so you will see occasional odd boxes, such as b} or ub}. They
look bad, but aren't dangerous, so just ignore them.

Also unfortunately, ShowHyp does not appear to be able to call up the
picture viewer from within the newsletter. You'll have to view the pictures
in a paint or picture viewer program.

While not perfect, ShowHyp at least allows all Amiga owners to view
AmigaGuide files, whether newsletters or program documentation.


                             IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN AMIGA
                             --------------------------

Micro Guerrilla News, like all AmigaGuide files, is an ASCII text file with
certain commands embedded in the text. These commands always start with an
@ sign. Anyway, you can use whatever text viewer or editor you have to read
the newsletter. Just ignore all the @{} stuff. Various program also exist
on PCs and Macs to view/convert Amiga's IFF pictures. Graphics Workshop is
one such program.
