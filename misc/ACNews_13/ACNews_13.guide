Welcome to AmiChannel News

Hello and welcome to the 13th issue of AmiChannel News.

I  do  not  know why, but summer use to be a time for convulsion. Days after the
release  of  the  June  issue of the magazine you are reading, Amiga dropped the
bomb  again.  Not  QNX,  but  Linux  is  going to be the OS kernel for the Amiga
Operative Environment (also known as Amiga OE).

Actually,  the  bomb was dropped by QNX themself when they announced the release
of  his  own  operating  system  (QNX  Neutrino)  for  the current Amiga line of
computers.  So,  Amiga (I mean Jim Collas) had to release a note very quickly to
notify that Linux was going to be the OS kernel.

People like Fleecy Moss, Dave Haynie and Holger Kruse have pointed out that this
decision  is  not the correct one. Other people have disagreed with the election
but  they  have  not  raised any valid technical reason (I will not say any name
because they suck).

Sometimes,  I can not understand this Amiga "community" (if it does exists). Jim
Collas has saved the classic Amiga and he wants to release a new platform with a
modern  operating  environment. And because they take a decision some people are
against  for,  they  complain.  Perhaps  this  is  the key word for some people.
Complain. Complain about everything. And if they can not, they explode. So, I am
asking  you  to  be patient and not overreact like others. Give Amiga a break to
explain everything. Then decide for yourself.

Linux has his disadvantages. Of course, it is not the perfect OS, becuase it has
some technical issues which have to be solved. But QNX has its own disadvantages
For instance, support of BIG names.

Amiga  has  not  chosen  Linux  because  they want people to complain. They have
selected  Linux  because  with  it we have some chance to succeed. For instance,
Corel  has  announced  their  support  for  the  Amiga  NG,  that  is, the Amiga
Multimedia  Convergence  Computer  (Amiga MCC, MCC = 1200 in roman numbers). So,
you can expect a wordprocessor like WordPerfect for the new Amiga.

Another  reason  is  the  chip.  It is not official but Transmeta is the Monster
Mistery Chip. Intentional or by mistake, Amiga showed a video in this year World
of Amiga and Amiwest, with the Transmeta name clearly displayed on the screen.

But  the  controversy  does  not  end here. Phase 5 have announced that their G3
boards,  along  with  their  new multimedia computer AmiRage K2, are going to be
powered  by  the  QNX Newtrino OS, so do not expect that your legacy software is
going  to  be  run in the Phase 5 boards. Anyway, they are doing their business.
So, good luck to them

Let  me  to  finnish this editorial to announce that there is not going to be an
August  issue  of this e-magazine, because I am leaving for my holidays. So, see
you in September.

           HYPERION ACQUIRES LICENSE TO PORT HERETIC II TO THE AMIGA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Hyperion  is  very pleased to announce that it has (in collaboration with Stuart
Walker  from  Digital  Images)  acquired a license from Activision to port Raven
Software's highly acclaimed Heretic II to the Amiga.

Heretic  II  is the stunning conceptual sequel to Heretic and Hexen and is based
on  Id  Software's  advanced Quake IITM engine. The Amiga version will require a
PPC  processor  (WarpOS)  and a graphics card and will take full advantage of 3D
accelerators  through  Warp3D.  The  possibility  of  a  68060  version is under
investigation  but  would  in  any  case require 3D acceleration. Other features
include  virtual  3D  sound  (supported through AHI) and network-play (internet,
modem, LAN).

The  Amiga port will be carried out by Peter Annuss (ADescent PPC, EGCS WarpUp),
Joe  Sera  (AQCVid,  Skyline  II,  ObjectWorkshop),  Hans-Joerg Frieden (Warp3D,
ADescent W3D, Shogo) and others. Release is expected to be early to mid Q4 1999.

"Hyperion's  goal  is to provide Amiga users with some of the best games to date
and  this  is just the beginning", says Hyperion's managing partner Ben Hermans.
"High-end  games  require high-end machines. There is some really exciting Amiga
technology  out there today with more on the horizon and we intend to push it to
the limit. If users support us by getting us the sales we need, they will have a
lot to look forward to".

Technical Requirements (subject to change)

   * OS 3.0 or higher
   * PPC processor (supported through WarpOS)
   * Graphics card
   * 3D acceleration supported through Warp3D (OpenGL)

Explorer 2260 Update

This  is  what  has  been added (on the design and programming end of things) to
Explorer 2260 in June:

   * Core system, file operation and synchronisation code complete.
   * High-level command interpreter V1 (non-optimised) complete.
   * external game preferences and startup module complete.

Unfortunately  outside  development  commitments  have  got in the way and could
reduce  the  amount  of  work  that can be done on the game (programming side of
things)  over the next couple of months. Hopefully this won't affect the current
release schedule too much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maim & Mangle Update

Well  this  month has had quite a lot of developments over the past month. These
include:
   * First  screenshots  of  the present game engine have been put on to the TWF
     website  www.worldfoundry.com/M&M.  These  are early pictures of the engine
     and  will  have  quite  a  few improvements in appearance over the next few
     months.
   * 3D  landscape has now been added to the engine (screenshots of it in a week
     or thereabouts).
   * Units can be moved.
   * A  secondary window on the GUI allows up to 3 units selected to display the
     viewpoint  from  their  perspective  (this  will go from wireframe to fully
     texturemapped depending on the specification of the Amiga).
   * 16 bit mode (only CVPPC/BVPPC)
   * Scroll the camera with the mouse.
   * Transparencies on the remote unit marker
   * Shadows  (yeah,  units/buildings  leave  their shadow on the terrain). Work
     still to be done on that to improve the look.
   * Min obj, to speedup the engine when using zoom factor 3
   * New Terrain Editor
   * I'm  sure  there are loads of other stuff added that I've forgot about it's
     been updated so much recently. :)

There are still loads to do in July of-course and these include:
   * a new gui (maybe based on semi-transparent floating windows)
   * more fx effects
   * first AI implementation

There  was  also  several  work on our internal development tool, M3D editor and
Terrain  editor.  A  decision on the new GFX artist(s) for Maim & Mangle will be
made this Monday/Tuesday (as long as it's not the end of the world on Sunday :).

             AMIGA SELECTS LINUX AS THEIR NEXT GENERATION OS KERNEL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

July  9, 1999 - San Diego, California. Amiga has selected Linux as the OS kernel
for the new Amiga Operating Environment that is scheduled for release later this
year.  Amiga is selecting Linux after several months of evaluating the technical
progress of the OS and the tremendous industry support that Linux has gained.

The  development  community has given Linux a major endorsement and the momentum
that  Linux  now enjoys is having a significant impact on the computer industry.
There  are  a  large number of hardware device drivers and software applications
written for Linux already and this number is growing daily.

"Our strategy for implementing the new Amiga is to integrate the best technology
in  the  industry  into  a  new,  efficient, exciting and revolutionary computer
platform  focused  on  the  future" said Jim Collas, President and CEO of Amiga.
"Using  Linux  as  our  OS  kernel  is  only  one component of the overall Amiga
Operating Environment."

Look  for  more  information on the choice of Linux as part of the overall Amiga
Operating Environment here.

        OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY BY JIM COLLAS - LINUX ANNOUNCEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Amigans,

After  months  of  research  and in-depth discussions with all of our technology
partners we have decided to use Linux as the primary OS kernel for the new Amiga
Operating Environment (OE). I know this decision is a shock to many of you given
the  previous  announcements  and  activities  relative  to QNX. This was a very
complicated  and  difficult decision to make and I assure you that I didn't make
this decision without a significant amount of research and deliberation. We have
been  researching  Linux  since February but didn't finalized our decision until
several  weeks ago. We were planning to communicate it to the Amiga community in
the technology brief that will be released in the next few days.

I  am  pressed  to  communicate  the  Linux decision before the technology brief
because  of  information  released by QNX in the last few days. This information
had  not  been  reviewed or approved for release by Amiga. In light of our Linux
decision,  this  information is confusing and misleading so I would like to take
the time to clarify the situation. I can't disclose any details of the Amiga/QNX
discussions because of legally binding confidentiality agreements but I can talk
to  you  about our decision to use the Linux kernel. I think that you will agree
that  this  is  the  right  decision  once  you  understand the reasons for this
decision.

Before  I  continue,  I  should  mention  that  our technology decision does not
reflect  negatively  on  QNX.  I  believe  that QNX is a good company with great
technology.  I just believe that Linux gives us a better chance of executing our
plans successfully.

The  decision  to  use  QNX  as our OS partner on our next generation multimedia
convergence  computer  (MCC)  was  made  late  last  year.  When  I took over as
president  of  Amiga in February of this year, I initiated an in-depth review of
existing  Amiga  plans  and  decisions. As president of Amiga I had to make sure
that  we  were  defining a strategy and an execution plan that would allow Amiga
and the Amiga community to be successful. We reviewed our strategy, architecture
decisions,  technology  partners, and execution plans. During this review period
we  also  added  a  number  of  very  talented and experienced people to help us
finalize our technology and product decisions. I am confident that we now have a
solid and exciting plan that people can have confidence in.

Linux  has  been picking up substantial momentum over the past year as a viable,
open OS alternative in the marketplace. This momentum, the growing commitment to
Linux  applications  from  a  wide  variety of software vendors, and the growing
availability  of  Linux  device  drivers  from  hardware  vendors,  makes  it  a
compelling  candidate.  Additionally,  with  all  of  the  significant component
suppliers putting resources on writing drivers for Linux it was difficult to get
them to port to yet another operating system. Using the Linux OS as a foundation
for  our  Amiga  OE  allows  us  to  leverage  a significant amount of available
software  drivers  and  utilities.  This  allows  us to quickly support multiple
graphics cards and other peripherals.

Given  the  above-mentioned  advantages,  we decided to do an in-depth technical
analysis  of Linux to determine if it was a suitable OS kernel for our new Amiga
operating  environment  (OE).  As  we ported parts of our higher level operating
environment   and  AmigaObjectTM  architecture  to  Linux,  we  discovered  some
significant  performance  advantages  in  the  Linux  kernel  in  areas  such as
distributed  object  messaging  across  a  network (up to 10X the performance of
Windows  NT).  Although Linux configurations can be very large in size, the core
pieces of the Linux kernel are actually very small and efficient. In considering
hardware  requirements  we  also  found companies working on hardware components
that  were  optimized  for the Linux kernel. Additionally, Linux is probably the
most  stable  operating system available in the market. After months of in-depth
research  we  were  confident  that  we  could  build an extremely exciting next
generation Amiga based on the Linux OS kernel.

Does  this  mean  that  the next generation Amiga will not be unique? Absolutely
not!  Remember  that the OS kernel is only one component of the new Amiga OE and
the  hardware  is unique. The revolutionary nature of the Amiga OE is in the way
it  extends the traditional operating system to provide a host environment for a
new  class  of  portable  applications  - applications that exist in a pervasive
networked  computing  environment.  We will be integrating multiple technologies
including an efficient windowing environment and a unique user interface.

In  summary,  we decided to use Linux because of the incredible momentum and the
fact  that  it  is  solid technology and a good foundation for our new Amiga OE.
Additionally,  the  Linux  community  is  an  impressive force that we should be
aligned  with.  We  share  many  common  values  and  objectives  with the Linux
community.  Using  Linux  as  our  OS  kernel  allows  us  to build a unique and
revolutionary  operating  environment  while leveraging the enormous momentum of
Linux.

The  soon  to be released technology brief will further explain our architecture
and plans for integrating all of the selected technology. Once you read it, I am
confident  that  you  will  understand  the  revolutionary  nature  of  the next
generation  Amiga.  I  assure  you  that Amiga and the Amiga community will be a
driving force behind the next computer revolution.

Sincerely,
Jim Collas
President, Amiga

                    BGUI MANIFEST - PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After  being  handed  over several times, BGUI development is alive and kicking.
BGUI  is free to anybody. Development only depends on volunteer work. If you can
program for AmigaOS, learn here how you can help.

What is BGUI?

     BGUI  stands  for  BOOPSI  Graphical  User Interface. BGUI is a toolkit for
     developing  user interfaces for Amiga OS based on BOOPSI. BOOPSI stands for
     Basic Object Oriented Programming Support for Intuition. BOOPSI is a system
     that makes part of the Amiga OS user interface library -- Intuition.

     BOOPSI  is  meant  to  provide  a layer to support user interface component
     programming.  It  is  based  on the Object Oriented Programming principles.
     BOOPSI  was  introduced back in 1990 with Amiga OS 2 but it only provided a
     small set of user interface components.

BGUI history

   * Jan van den Baard created BGUI

        BGUI was started by Jan van den Baard after having developed GadToolsBox
        in  1993,  a  gadtools.library  based  user  interface builder. BGUI was
        released  when  there  were  many promises of GUI toolkits that would be
        flexible  and  not  as  complex as MUI, another GUI toolkit although not
        based on Amiga OS gadget BOOPSI class.

   * Ian Einman carried on

        Later  in  1996, when Jan could not carry on BGUI development due to the
        lack of time, Ian Einman took over adding many important features. Later
        in  1997  Ian  also  realized  that  he  could  no  longer continue BGUI
        development.  That  was  the  time when I decided to take over to ensure
        that Amiga would still have a free BOOPSI based GUI toolkit.

   * Manuel Lemos takes over where Ian left it

        Carrying  on  the development of a reasonably size GUI toolkit like BGUI
        was  no «day at the beach». You have to discover what was in the mind of
        the  previous  developers  to fix known bugs, add new features and still
        not break whatever was already working OK. So, I decided to use the best
        of my software development knowledge to work on it.

   * A discrete group of developers was invited to join

        BGUI  is  well  structured but there was little support to do the job of
        keeping  track  and  fixing  the  large  amount  of  bugs and incomplete
        features  that  I  «inherited».  I had to take no less care than I would
        take for other projects that I started from scratch.

        Discretely, I called all the Amiga developers that I thought would still
        be interested in BGUI. I built a site for BGUI using my experience in my
        main activity as software developer that is Web programmer.

        I  wanted  the  site  to be private until I had something usable. Before
        then  nothing would be announced to avoid making promises that I was not
        sure  I  could keep. I wanted to spare Amiga users that were already fed
        up  of  all  the  false  promises  that have been made since Commodore's
        demise.

   * Keeping track of reported bugs

        I  installed  a  problem report tracking application on the site that is
        able  to take bug reports and feature requests into an on-line database.
        Anybody  can  check  up the report database right there to keep track of
        the progress that is made.

        That  application also forwards all the reports to a private developers'
        mailing  list.  Whenever  there  is some progress, either a bug that was
        fixed  or  some  developer requesting for more information, whoever made
        the report is notified by e-mail.

        So,  with  the  reports  of  the  other  developers  it became easier to
        concentrate  on  everything that needed to be fixed and improved. No bug
        report  goes  unnoticed or forgotten until it is fixed. Keeping a report
        database  is  a basic thing serious developers have to do, but not every
        developer is aware of its importance.

   * Program torture debugging

        Many  bugs  were  fixed  but many more remained as they were too hard to
        track or to reproduce. The BGUI library is mostly written in C language.
        The  usual  implication of using the C language are the programming bugs
        that  lead  to  memory  misuse,  that  is, misuse of address pointers to
        access an invalid memory range.

        I  decided  to  add  memory  debugging  support to BGUI to «torture» the
        library  code.  That  would  force  the  bugs to show up sooner when the
        library  is  being  tested, rather than later when the users crash their
        machines when they try it.

        An  impressive  amount  of  bugs  were squeezed this way. It seemed that
        there  were  bugs  that remained since BGUI's early days. Progressively,
        all  the  bugs that caused memory leaks, memory over-runs, already freed
        memory  blocks  and  attempts  to  free  memory that was never allocated
        (corrupted pointers) were fixed.

   * Cooperation of other developers

        Things were going very well and I was so confident that I thought that I
        could handle all the fixing by myself. I could not be more wrong! Soon I
        realized  that  there  was  a  hard  to fix amount of reported bugs that
        seemed hard to trace and could not be replicated all the time.

        By  then,  I  decide  to call for the cooperation of other developers so
        they  could  also  look  at the code and try to figure what was wrong. I
        have  set  a CVS server in the site so all developer could reach out for
        the most up-to-date version of the source tree.

   * CVS blessing

        CVS  allows  the  source  code  or  any  other  files  to be stored in a
        repository  hosted  in  a  computer that is reachable from the Internet.
        After getting the source for first time, the developers only need to log
        on  again  to  get only the files that were updated, saving much on-line
        time. The CVS client does this automatically for you.

        CVS  also  allows  anybody  to  request  any version of the files in the
        repository  as  they  were  in  a  given date. It keeps track of all the
        changes done in every little revision committed in the project since day
        0 when I took over and made it all be stored in a CVS repository.

        Using  CVS  is  yet  another  good  practice  that all developers should
        follow, even in single programmer projects. The good part is that CVS is
        freely available for many platforms including for the Amiga as ported by
        the Geek Gadgets project.

   * Other developers can find and fix bugs too if you let them

        Sharing  the  source  code with the other developers turned to be a good
        move  because Janne Jalkanen finally found the cause of many of the bugs
        hinted  by  Simon  Edwards.  Those bugs were crashing the machine in odd
        ways  because  they  were  making  the Intuition/input.device task crash
        randomly.

        One  pattern  that  was  noticed  is  that the bugs did not exist in the
        previous public release of BGUI. So it must have been something that was
        added  after  that, but I could not guess what it was. It must have been
        something that Ian Einman added.

        Simon  suggested  that  these  random  crashes could have been caused by
        exhaustion  of  the  current task stack space. Janne decided to add some
        debugging code to check the hypothesis of the stack space being overrun.
        Bingo!

        Ian  Einman added an extra base class in BGUI hierarchy. That base class
        was  important  because  it added great power to BGUI to do many things.
        Some  things were claimed to be impossible to do with gadget class based
        BOOPSI  objects,  like  having  gadgets scrolling in clipped views, also
        known as virtual groups.

        The  problem  is  that made the Intuition task finally exceed its meager
        4KB  of  stack  space.  The  fix  was  obvious:  adding  automatic stack
        extension.  Despite  that,  soon  we  realized  that  it would seriously
        degrade  performance  of  user  input  handling  when  BGUI gadgets were
        active.

   * The trick of extending stack space on demand

        Ian Einman simplified BGUI classes' method dispatching by adding support
        for  using a method jump table to be defined at the class creation time.
        So, when the class was added, all that was needed to be done was to pass
        an  array of pointers to functions that implemented each of the classes'
        methods.  A  built-in class dispatcher provided by BGUI as default would
        handle all the method requests from there.

        The  BGUI  default  class  dispatcher  should  be  the  place to add the
        automatic  stack  extension.  That  would  help  prevent  the bgui class
        hierarchy  overrunning  the  Intuition  task's stack space when handling
        user input.

        However,  we  noticed that allocating and freeing the stack space in the
        dispatcher  function  turned  out to be a performance hit. That was only
        affecting  the Intuition task because it is the one that handles all the
        input events that are fed to gadget input handler methods.

        We  had  to solve that by using a pre-allocated memory block to do stack
        swapping  just  when  the  current  task  running  out  of  stack is the
        Intuition  task.  It worked wonders because it is hardly noticeable that
        the stack space is being extended for the Intuition task on demand.

   * BGUI made BOOPSI efficient

        This would not have come to the surface if BGUI did not increase the
        depth of its BOOPSI class hierarchy. Anyway, it would probably happen
        sooner rather than later when somebody used a custom subclass that
        would increase the hierarchy depth.

        This  reminded  me  of  a  similar  situation that I realized when I was
        working  for  Softwood.  Terry  Wright was adding a class to FinalWriter
        hierarchy  that  implemented  a  much requested feature: tables for that
        Amiga  word  processor.  That class also made the input handler task run
        out of stack space.

        Janne's  solution  is much more efficient because it will prevent future
        stack space problems of future classes making BGUI more trustworthy as a
        stable  GUI class library. If programs crash the system because of stack
        space overrun problems, that will no longer be when calling BGUI code.

   * A BOOPSI method call shortcut

        Another interesting move was made when I decided to eliminate one of the
        problems that have been raised by BOOPSI detractors: the method
        execution overhead of traversing a deep class hierarchy. BOOPSI
        detractors claim that a reasonable amount of time is wasted by class
        dispatchers when the classes have to invoke the super class method to
        inherit its behavior.

        Since  now  most  BGUI  classes  implicitly use the BGUI's default class
        dispatcher,  it is possible to determine if a method is implemented by a
        class  or is inherited from its super class. So, I realized that I could
        make  the  default  to  shortcut the calling path and go straight to the
        first super class that implements a requested method.

        This not only eliminates the overhead of calling methods on a class that
        inherits  them  instead  implement them somehow, but also eliminates the
        extra  stack  space  that is required by each class dispatcher function.
        Furthermore the dispatcher method lookup was made by using binary search
        on the method jump table that is previously sorted at the class creation
        time.

        Later, the method dispatching was further improved by using a hash table
        with  all  the  class methods, including the methods that were inherited
        from  the super class. In this case, a hash table is even more efficient
        because  it  requires  less  method lookup overhead. More efficient than
        this, I do not know.

   * Status quo

        All  this  took  place  on our spare time that we decided to dedicate to
        Amiga  and BGUI in particular. Too bad that the Amiga community is today
        much smaller than in the past to enjoy the results of our efforts.

        Still  there is a lot to do but we have not quit. We could use some more
        help  from those that believe in Amiga OS as we still know and enjoy it.
        Read ahead to learn how you can help.

What does BGUI offer to Amiga developers?

   * We already have MUI, so what do we need BGUI for?

        The  debate  of MUI versus the world has always been intense since MUI's
        early  days. In fact that debate is still revived here and there in many
        mailing  lists  and  news groups. It is pointless to revive it if people
        are too biased to present reasonable arguments.

        BGUI  also  came up as a MUI alternative, not to be yet another one, but
        to be one that honors the Amiga way of doing it: simple and fast.

        It is undeniable the importance of MUI in the Amiga history. It made
        possible for many developers to become motivated enough to write Amiga
        applications. It is also true that MUI also has some features that are
        worthy to be widely adopted.

        In  spite  of  that, MUI always suffered from public complaints of users
        that  do  not  enjoy it, despite the fact that they are not aware of the
        technical  details.  Many  developers  are  not pleased with some of the
        circumstances  that  MUI  presents.  One  of those circumstances is that
        developers often are blamed for their being slow because they use MUI.

        For  starters,  MUI defeats one of the remaining advantages of Amiga OS:
        having  a  dedicated  task  to  process  the  user input and immediately
        present visual changes in the user interface that reflect user actions.

        All  this  because  most MUI input handling classes are not derived from
        Amiga  OS  BOOPSI  gadget  class.  In  practice  this means that what is
        handling  user  input  are the MUI applications instead of the Intuition
        task.

        There  is  always  a  processing  delay  due to Intuition to application
        messaging  while  passing  input  event  information.  This  is  why MUI
        applications  look  slow. MUI defenders will claim that MUI is not slow.
        MUI  is not slow, to be technically accurate. It is just that it handles
        user input with delay.

        Still  MUI defenders claim that people have to upgrade their hardware to
        make  proper  use  of  their Amiga. The fact is that BOOPSI gadget class
        based  applications  do  not  look slow on slower Amigas. Also in faster
        Amigas MUI applications still look slow.

   * After all, BGUI is free and open to anybody...

        One  of  the reasons why I decided to adopt BGUI as the base of my Amiga
        software  is  because  it  was  freely available to everybody, whether I
        developed  freely  or  paid  software. The programmers that use BGUI and
        their application users do not have to pay fees to anybody.

        Now,  that I am in charge of BGUI development, it is great to be able to
        fix  all  the  bugs  that  I  may find. Unlike some other user interface
        toolkits,  BGUI  is open to any other developer that would like to help.
        You can help to fix any bugs or adding new features if you would like to
        do so.

        The  source  code  is  not  yet  publicly  available.  Anyway,  all  the
        developers that came to me and asked to join the team to fix the bugs or
        add  features  were  granted  access to the source code. It is available
        either from the BGUI Web site or through CVS.

   * Developers added what they needed most

        BGUI  needed many things and still needs many more. What matters is that
        most  of  the developers that are part of the team were able to add what
        they felt they needed most.

        For  instance,  the documentation needs to be improved. Jeff Grimmet and
        Anton  Rolls  have  been spending some time in updating it. Furthermore,
        Anton  added  the  ability  to  have  our GUI based documentation editor
        program  to  save not only in Autodoc format, but also in AmigaGuide and
        HTML  formats.  This  program  can be freely used by other developers to
        produce their documentation.

        Jilles Tjoelker created a ARexx shared library that lets you create BGUI
        user interfaces from the ARexx scripts. BGUI ARexx library can be freely
        used by anybody.

        Peter  Bornhall  contributed with a program to edit preferences that let
        the users customize the look and feel of BGUI programs.

        Several  developers  contributed  with  the code for useful classes like
        Nick  Christie's  Tree  List  View.  Several developers helped on adding
        support  in BGUI for different C compilers (SAS/C, GNU C, Storm C, VBCC,
        DICE, etc.), C++, E, Assembly, etc..

        Nobody  had  to wait for the BGUI developers to support what they needed
        most.  Anybody  may  come  up  and  do it by yourself and shares for the
        benefit of everybody.

   * What about the future?

        There  are plans to completely open BGUI source code once some important
        features  are finished in BGUI 41.x. One is the BGUI preferences' editor
        that  is  functional but it is not complete. Another is the clipped view
        gadget,  which,  although  it  works  fine,  that despite it works fine,
        nesting still presents a few display offset computation bugs.

        Once  these  features  are finished I plan to close BGUI library version
        41.x  and  move  on  to version 42. Future plans have been discussed but
        everything is up to the Amiga developers.

        We have already plans to implement some nice things, as time permits. We
        have  been  looking  into a XML based format as replacement of the Amiga
        documentation format (AKA Autodoc).

        We  are  also  considering XML as a base for a user interface definition
        format that you may edit by hand if you like and use without recompiling
        your applications.

        A XML based format is also being considered to define a language neutral
        format  for  include  files.  A  processing tool would convert XML based
        includes  to include files for different languages: C, E, Assembly, C++,
        etc..

        Other  than  that  we  are  planning  on having more and better gadgets,
        application  creation  classes,  screen  management classes, easier menu
        creation,  etc..  That depends on the time and the will of developers to
        work  on it. If you feel capable and interested just join the team. Take
        a look at the BGUI page at: www.bgui.e-na.net.

   * And what about BGUI in the future Amiga OS?

        Amiga  OS  3.5  is expected to come an improved GUI support all based on
        BOOPSI  gadget  class  with  even  a GUI builder. After all that will be
        Haage & Partner Storm Wizard in disguise.

        Some  will  ask  if  is  there  a  future  for BGUI once Amiga OS 3.5 is
        released.  Of  course!  BGUI  applications will also work under OS 2 and
        since  not  everybody  will  upgrade  BGUI will remain a free attractive
        BOOPSI gadget class based option.

        As  for  Amiga OS 5, it will be QNX Unix disguised of Amiga OS. If there
        will  be indeed an Amiga API emulation in the QNX based Amiga, BGUI will
        possibly run on it. If not, that will not be an Amiga anyway despite the
        name.

        Anyway,  like the Amiga, BGUI changed hands many times, but now it has a
        larger  team of technically qualified working on it. There are more than
        a  dozen  developers  on  the  team  today.  You are welcome to join the
        development  team  and  work together with us on this fine project. Long
        live the Amiga and BGUI!

                           THE FXPAINT PRESS RELEASE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WHAT IS FXPAINT ?

fxPAINT  is  a  new, revolutional image processiong software for the AMIGA, that
will  make  use  of  the  latest hard- and software existing for the AMIGA. It`s
planned to release a first, full release on CD within this year (1999).

MAIN FEATURES

fxPAINT  is  a  strongly  extended  image  processing software for the AMIGA. It
contains  the  usual  painting  tools,  but  also  offers  a lot more. E.g. it`s
possible to mark whole areas by a simple mouseclick. Gradients can be added by a
simple dragging, too. fxPAINT allows you the usage of several, natural pens like
chalk,  pencil,  the  so  called "Artist Pen" or simply with pens, that were cut
from  another  picture  before.  As you might already have thought, when reading
fxPAINT`s name, fxPAINT is not limit to painting with colors or cutted pens, but
offers  you  a  great  palette of high-quality effects. This includes, but isn`t
limited  to:  Standards-effects  like changing of brightness, contrast or gamma.
Special-effects   like   light-sources   or   bumpmapped   surfaces,  glow-  and
shadow-effects,  waves, explosive supernovas, distortions, etc. You`ll also find
professional  tools  like  Gradtion-curves or matrix operations. This opens up a
great  number  of  posibilities  to  create and design pictures. Another special
feature  is  fxPAINT`s  realtime-mode, that shows changes to the effect-settings
immediately  after  they  were  made. E.g. Light-sources can be dragged over the
pictures  -  in  realtime  and  full quality!! fxPAINT basically is similar to a
layer-based image processing package, but it isn`t directly equal to it. You can
paint  with effects while the Alpha-Channel (that can have full 24bit- depth) is
fully  used,  if  active.  Painting-mistakes can be fixed easily by the undo and
redo-function.  Of  course  fxPAINT  is  not  only  very usable for changing and
manipulating   images   but   also  for  creating  them.  E.g.  fire,  fractals,
screenshots,  videodigitizes,  etc.  can be made directly from within fxPAINT by
some simple clicks.

EXTERNAL DEVICES AND MODULES

The  support  of scanners and videodigitizers and an open, documented Plugin-API
will  make  you  feel,  that other programs aren`t needed any more. To guarantee
brilliant  printings,  optimized  routines for the printer.device and TurboPrint
are  available  within fxPAINT. fxPAINT keeps the internal multitasking. You can
work even while scanning!

INTERNAL MODULES

Maybe you are one of those (like me, too), that don`t make great efforts to sort
the  graphics on HD in order to keep an overview over them. That`s why you might
like the inbuilt picture database called fxALBUM. Editing a picture is very easy
then,  as  you only have to click on the image and on another button in order to
have the picture loaded in fxPAINT. If you want to, you can print overviews over
your pictures as well. For fast conversions between the file formats, the module
fxCONV  is  available. It allows you automated conversion of several directories
and/or  files full of pictures into another format easily. If you want to create
graphics  for  the  WWW  and  want  to  make  use  of  so called HTML-Imagemaps,
fxIMAGEMAP  might  be  your tool, allowing you easy creation of ImageMaps within
minutes!

THE GUI-SYTEM

fxPAINT  has  internal BOOPSI-classes of its own, that ideally adapt to the used
hardware.  No  matter  what hardware is used, the fxPAINT-GUI is full of images,
what makes fxPAINT more usable and effective. Of course, a bubble-help-system is
available describing the most important buttons, so you needn`t guess, what this
or  that  button  might  be  for.  On  truecolor-screens,  fxPAINT`s GUI is most
impressing,  because  it  then  uses  24bit-gradients, that give it an even more
modern  and unique look. fxPAINT offers you the ability to adapt to your already
existing  knowledge  by  offering  three  modes  for  novices, average users and
experts.

             QNX - DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISE TO THE AMIGA COMMUNITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dan Dodge
CTO, QNX Software Systems

Last  November  at  Computer  98  in  Cologne  I promised to deliver an advanced
operating  system  that  would  once  again  put  Amigans  at  the  forefront of
technology.  Over  the  past  7  months  we have had a team of over 40 engineers
working  towards  making  that  promise  and vision a reality. We are now in the
final  stages  of  development and are poised to put these new technologies into
the hands of thousands of serious, enthusiastic developers like yourself.

QNX  is  often compared to UNIX, LINUX and BSD. We do share the same POSIX APIs,
and most code written for these systems ports easily to QNX, but the resemblance
ends  there.  Based  on  20  years  of  OS  experience, QNX has a radically more
advanced    architecture.    It's    a   massively   scalable,   multi-threaded,
fault-tolerant,  realtime  OS  designed for devices and computers of any type or
size.  QNX  provides  a  unique  network  architecture  where large full-service
protocol  stacks  aren't  required on each computer and devices plugged into the
network  are  simply  "discovered" automatically by other devices - all services
and  peripherals  of  the new device can then be used by any other device in the
network. QNX is also the only self-hosted RTOS where the development environment
and  the  runtime  target  environment  are  the same. And though we're not open
source,  we  adopt  an  "open source" policy for hardware-specific drivers. This
allows  us  to  continually  support  the  latest hardware advances, while still
maintaining  control  of core technology. More importantly, it ensures QNX has a
focused vision for the future.

If  you  haven't  visited  our  web site before, I invite you to look at the QNX
Realtime  OS  and  Photon microGUI®. If you'd like to dig a little deeper, we've
included  some  screen  shots of the exciting new look-and-feel for Photon below
(click  on  the  image  to  expand).  We've also put the new QNX Neutrino System
Architecture manual online.

In  a nutshell, QNX is the core and Photon the graphical environment for our new
OS foundation:

   * QNX  -  Supports  POSIX  thread  services,  MMU  protected  memory  for all
     applications  and  drivers,  variety  of  file  systems  (QNX,  flash, DOS,
     CD/DVD-ROM,  etc.),  TCP/IP  stack, transparent distributed networking, and
     development libraries.

   * Photon  microGUI  - Complete windowing system with full Unicode support for
     integrated  internationalization.  Also includes visual application builder
     (PhABTM),  powerful  development  environment  (layered  libraries, over 50
     widgets,  built-in image support, online documentation, etc.), web browser,
     multimedia player, 3D graphics, and gaming support.

Although  Photon  represents  a  unique  new  graphical  environment,  it  works
seamlessly  with  existing windowing systems. You can, for example, connect to a
Photon  desktop  from  a  Windows desktop or connect to a Windows desktop from a
Photon  desktop.  And  because a large number of existing source bases use the X
Window  System, we allow developers to compile an application for X and then run
the application under Photon.

                       QNX Developers Network for Amigans

To  deliver  this  technology  to  Amiga  developers,  we're  creating  the "QNX
Developers  Network for Amigans". Qualified Amiga developers will receive, at no
charge, a complete beta development package that includes the QNX Realtime OS, a
suite     of    state-of-the-art    multimedia    technologies,    the    unique
network-distributed  Photon microGUI, and a self-hosted development environment.
We  will  also  create  a  dedicated  online newsgroup, as well as a web site to
provide technology updates and previews.

Initially,   we're  looking  for  beta  sites  interested  in  porting  existing
applications  or  writing  new applications. Companies and individual developers
are  both  invited to join - the only thing we ask is commitment. We want active
beta testers, not tire kickers, who will promise to provide valuable feedback.

Of  course,  commitment goes both ways. So in addition to starting this program,
we  will,  as  of now, become active and vocal in all the appropriate newsgroups
and magazines. We're looking forward to being a fully active member of the Amiga
community,  and to working closely with Amigans to create the next revolution in
multimedia computing.

                                Initial Release

Our  initial beta release will be for x86 PCs. While this hardware platform may,
at  first,  seem undesirable to some of you, remember that most QNX applications
and device drivers are source-identical across CPUs and boards. As a result, any
work  done  on x86 will migrate easily to any other supported platform. We chose
x86  because it's the hardware solution most widely available at low cost in the
time frame that we wish to release the first beta - this Fall.

@node not11 "INTERNATIONAL AMIGA 2000 - THE AMIGA SHOWCASE TO THE WORLD"

           INTERNATIONAL AMIGA 2000 - THE AMIGA SHOWCASE TO THE WORLD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We would like to announce that the previously announced International Amiga show
in  Toronto,  Canada  will  not  happen this year. Rather, we have decided to to
postpone International Amiga to early 2000.

As  many that attended International Amiga 98 will know, we were successful in a
number of our objectives including:

   * Bring developers and manufactures together to show new products.
   * Bring  European  based manufactures to North America providing exposure and
     sales of their products.
   * Provide  an  great sales opportunity for all exhibitors and great deals for
     users.
   * Hosting the most professional Amiga show in North America since Commodore.

So why are we postponging? Quite simply so that:

   * We  can  co-ordinate  IAY2K  with  the  release  of AmigaSoftTM Systems and
     AmigaSoftTM Operating Environment
   * We  will  show  new  systems,  not  announce  them  the Amiga market has an
     opportunity to recover based on the release of AmigaSoftTM Systems
   * We have the time to make IAY2K even better than IA98

International Amiga 2000 (IAY2K) will expand on the success of IA98 by:

   * Working very closely with Amiga, Inc.
   * Attracting  North American and European developers and manufactures of both
     Classic Amiga and AmigaSoftTM environment products
   * Providing a venue to the world for all things Amiga

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR INMEDIATE RELEASE

Hello,

Unfortunately,  Space Station 3000 will be delayed until September/October 1999.
This  is due to a few problems, but this delay will make sure that Space Station
3000  really  is  the  best strategy game for the Amiga and PC. We apologise for
this, but this delay really is unavoidable.

Thankyou for your continued patience.

@node not14 "PHASE 5 UPDATE ON THE NEXT GENERATION G3 PRODUCT FOR THE AMIGA"

         PHASE 5 UPDATE ON THE NEXT GENERATION G3 PRODUCT FOR THE AMIGA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

July  6,  1999:  The  recently  announced  G3/G4  project is now already in it's
finalization stage. During the past six weeks, we have reviewed the overwhelming
response  of  the  Amiga  community,  and the large number of requests from many
users in regards to design features. At the same time, we have been checking the
latest   developments   in   the   industry,  which  have  opened  up  some  new
opportunities.  Based  on these new possibilitites, we have made some conceptual
changes  to  the  design  of  the CYBERSTORM G3/G4 and the BLIZZARD G3/G4 boards
which we will outline hereafter.

A  major  change  of  the  design  of both boards is that we have decided not to
integrate  SCSI  and IEEE-1394 on the products as standard, and therefore reduce
the  base  prices of the products (we will make add-ons available, and have also
added  other features, as you can read below). We have decided to do this, as we
found  out  that  many  customers have very different demands. For example, many
have  been  asking  for  implementation  of the U2W SCSI interface "even for the
BLIZZARD  G3/G4  board"  which  is  more  expensive  and  would later also cause
significant  additional  cost to the user in respect to cabling and adaptors. On
the  other hand, other customers may only want to connect some older legacy SCSI
devices and would be happy with a cheap 8-Bit SCSI port. Some other may not need
SCSI  at  all,  but  want to pay the lowest possible price for the step into the
G3/G4  generation.  Consequently,  we  have decided to offer base boards without
specialized   I/O   functionality,   but   with   the   option   for  customized
configurations.

The  good  news is, that the CYBERSTORM G3/G4 as well as the BLIZZARD G3/G4 will
both  have  PCI  slots already on board, which will allow to connect PCI add-ons
directly.  In  order  to  make the boards fit into the same Amiga systems as the
earlier  CYBERSTORM  PPC  and  BLIZZARD  603  boards,  we will be using Mini-PCI
connectors,  on which PCI modules in the new Mini-PCI standard can be installed.
This  design  allows  the users to connect Mini-PCI add-on cards directly to the
CYBERSTORM  G3/G4 as well as the BLIZZARD G3/G4, without the need to spend money
for  a  PCI  bus  expansion  or  to worry about mechanical integration of such a
board.  Developers,  as  well,  can  easily use either common Mini-PCI cards and
write  drivers for those, or quickly design new Mini-PCI cards with standard PCI
chips.

Another change is the usage of standard SO-DIMMs (SDRAM) as they can be found on
modern  notebooks,  which  also  allow to design the boards in very compact form
factors,  thus  making the CYBERSTORM G3/G4 fit into all A3000 and A4000 desktop
and  tower models (with fully installed memory and Mini-PCI cards), and make the
BLIZZARD  G3/G4  fit into most A1200 tower cases on the market and in use. As an
integrated standard I/O port, the CYBERSTORM G3/G4 as well as the BLIZZARD G3/G4
will  also  have  two  USB ports to connect a fast growing number of inexpensive
devices.

phase  5  digital  products  will  also  be offering some cost-effective MiniPCI
add-on modules. We have a number of options which add-on boards for I/O purposes
may  be  developed  by  us,  and which will be quickly realized depending on the
actual  demand. It may be noted that these options include those functions which
were  originally  considered  to  be  on-board,  and  are now simply moved to an
optional  MiniPCI  card.  The  currently  planned,  optionally available modules
include:

   * An U2W SCSI controller w/ internal 68pin port and active termination, for a
     net retail price of EURO 150 or US$160
   * An Ultra SCSI controller w/ internal 50pin port and active termination, for
     a net retail price of EURO 80 or US$90
   * An  Ultra-DMA  IDE/ATA controller 66MHz with 2 ports (to support 4 devices)
     for a net retail price of EURO 80 or US$90
   * An  IEEE-1394 Controller with 2 ports at 400Mbps, for a net retail price of
     EURO 100 or US$110

For any of these modules, a minimum order quantity of 250 units must be reached,
in  order  to justify the software and hardware realization. If for any of these
modules  this quantity can not be reached, we will inform all customers who have
ordered  this  option.  Customers can now - in the updated ordering form - order
these boards to be shipped with their BLIZZARD G3/G4 or CYBERSTORM G3/G4 board.

phase 5 digital products will also offer a next-generation gfx board for the new
accelerators. This new board, the CyberVisionNG, is currently planned to
   * incorporate  a  blazing fast 2D/3D graphics chip, with a powerful 128bit 3D
     engine
   * feature a maximum resolution of 1920x1200x32 @ 72Hz
   * offer  full  video  acceleration  to  support  full-screen,  full-frame DVD
     playback

and will be priced at EURO 180 or US$ 190 with 32 MB of local memory (net retail
price based on the memory prices of July 1999).

With  the large amount of local memory for display and textures, it will provide
highest performance and impressive 3D capabilities which have not been available
on the Amiga ever before, at a most attractive price point very close to that of
common PC products.

A word on G4 versions:

It  seems  today  that  with  the initial release of the BLIZZARD and CYBERSTORM
G3/G4  boards,  the  G4  processors may not be shipping in quantities. But it is
even more important that support of the improved features of the G4 processor by
Amiga software applications, developers and tools will take time, and it is very
unlikely  that  wider  support  of  these  features "which the Amiga users would
benefit  from"  will  be realized before early next year. Because of this reason
(and  yet  undetermined  pricing  and available frequencies), we have decided to
remove  the  G4  offer from the product list right now. We believe that the time
for  the  G4 will come in the year 2000, after Amiga developers have implemented
G4  support  into  software applications, and availability and pricing of the G4
processors  makes  them  an  even  more  attractive choice than in the very near
future.  Remember,  both  the  BLIZZARD and the CYBERSTORM G3/G4 have a socketed
processor  module,  which  will  allow  for easy upgrading - and phase 5 digital
products  will offer attractively priced G4 modules as soon as the G4 processors
are shipping in quantities.

To  summarize  the  features  of the BLIZZARD and CYBERSTORM G3/G4, here are the
updated technical specifications and prices:

Introduction

The  vision and mission of Amiga is to make computers and the Internet a natural
part  of  everyday  life, by creating an industry-standard operating environment
for  current  and future consumer computing devices that enables a wide range of
innovative Internet services. We use the term "operating environment" purposely,
as  this  software  infrastructure  extends  the traditional operating system to
provide  a  host  environment  for  a  new  class  of  portable  applications  -
applications  that  exist  in  a  pervasive networked computing environment, and
provide  transparent access to Internet content and services. In essence, we are
defining  a  new  distributed  home  computing  environment  that enables a user
experience   that  is  much  more  accessible  than  today's  personal  computer
experience.  This  environment will tie together personal computers, information
appliances,  set-top boxes, next-generation multimedia convergence computers and
game machines, and a host of other computing devices to define the next phase in
the evolution (revolution!) of computing.

The products under development at Amiga include:

   * Amiga   Operating   Environment   (Amiga   OE)  -  a  distributed  software
     architecture  that  extends traditional operating systems to provide a rich
     user  experience,  support  for  pervasive  networking, and a framework for
     portable  applications  that  transparently  access  Internet  content  and
     services.  A  subset  of  the  Amiga  OE  - the Amiga Information Appliance
     Environment  -  is  portable  to  a  wide  range  of  computing devices and
     information appliances.

   * Amiga  Multimedia  Convergence  Computer  (Amiga MCC) - a hardware/software
     platform  specifically designed to meld outstanding multimedia performance,
     a new level of ease of use, transparent access to the Internet and, through
     home  networking,  access  to  a growing family of Amiga-compatible devices
     around  the  home.  The  Amiga  MCC  will be distributed in two formats: an
     integrated multimedia convergence computer, and a standard ATX motherboard.
     Both  include  the  Amiga  OE,  an  underlying  OS, and support for digital
     video/DVD,  3D  graphics,  surround  sound, and emerging broadband and home
     networking  standards.  The  Amiga MCC is intended to serve as both a great
     platform  for  multimedia  applications such as 3D gaming and digital video
     integration,  and  as  the  hub  for  a  next-generation  distributed  home
     computing environment.

Technology Philosophy and Overview

Amiga's  long-term  business  success  calls  for  a  combination  of technology
innovation, and technology integration. We are integrating underlying technology
components  such  as  next-generation  CPU's,  micro-kernel  operating  systems,
graphics   and   GUI  libraries  and  frameworks,  graphics/video/communications
chipsets,  wired  and  wireless  home  networking  subsystems,  and object-based
development  environments,  in order to focus our resources on technologies that
add   unique  value  to  the  Amiga  Operating  Environment.  These  value-added
technologies  include: user interaction paradigms that are far simpler, and much
more   intelligent,   than  today's  personal  computer  paradigms;  a  "virtual
appliance" model that allows software applications to easily migrate to multiple
hardware  configurations;  support  for pervasive and transparent networking and
Internet   connectivity;   and  the  underlying  AmigaObject  architecture  that
implements and exposes all of the above.

This short technology brief is intended to provide a very high-level overview of
the  development  direction and technology choices being made by Amiga, and will
be  supported  by more in-depth whitepapers and product documentation as the new
Amiga products are introduced in the marketplace. In this document, we overview:

   * AmigaObjects and the Amiga Operating Environment
   * Amiga MCC Operating System
   * Graphics, Multimedia and GUI Frameworks
   * Pervasive Networking
   * Software Block Diagram
   * Amiga MCC Hardware Architecture
   * Development Tools and Applications

AmigaObjectsTM and the Amiga Operating Environment

AmigaObjects®  are  the  foundation  on  which  all  Amiga Operating Environment
services are built. AmigaObjects provide powerful component building blocks that
allow  developers  to rapidly create impressive and powerful Amiga applications.
AmigaObjects  furthermore  enable  integration  of  a  wide variety of different
technologies  under one umbrella. Networking is intrinsic to AmigaObjects, which
means  that  AmigaObjects  are free to move around on the network or use network
resources.  The AmigaObject architecture by virtue of this flexibility enables a
new class of "net-aware" applications where there is no clear boundary between a
device and the network.

We have chosen Java (© Sun Microsystems) as our primary programming language for
portable  applications  based on AmigaObjects (of course, C and C++ will also be
supported  for  native  MCC applications). With Java technologies such as kJava,
pJava, Java2 and Java Enterprise Edition, AmigaObject technology can be embedded
in  devices  as  small  as  hand-held  computers  and scale all the way to large
servers.  This  is  a  truly revolutionary approach to computing; an approach we
believe will change the face of computing.

The AmigaObject technology serves as the foundation for all objects in the Amiga
Operating  Environment.  The  power and flexibility of the AmigaObject naturally
extends  to  all other objects in the environment, thereby giving all objects in
the  system  network  transparency  and  the  ability  to proliferate across the
network.

As  mentioned  above,  AmigaObjects  also  integrate other technologies into our
framework.  In  particular,  we  make extensive use of as 3rd party technologies
where  appropriate.  Examples  include  Java, Jini, OpenGL and several audio and
video  codec's.  This  enables  Amiga  to  focus  its engineering efforts on the
AmigaObjects  and  the  Operating  Environment and less on creating technologies
that already exist.

Amiga MCC Operating System

One  of  our convictions is that modern operating systems are just one component
of  the  new  age  in  computing.  The  value  proposition is no longer just the
traditional  OS,  but  an  overall  environment  providing intelligent power and
transparent  services  for the end user. While the information appliance portion
of  the  Amiga Operating Environment is portable, and will be ported to a number
of  operating  systems by Amiga and Amiga's OEM partners over time, we needed to
make an OS foundation decision for the Amiga MCC.

There  are a number of very interesting OS choices in the marketplace, and it is
fair to say that we have evaluated them all over the past year. From traditional
RTOS  vendors  such  as  Wind  River  and QNX, to BeOS from Be Systems, to Sun's
JavaOS  built on Chorus, to Linux. As has been previously announced, we had been
working  for  some months with QNX Software Systems to try to adapt the QNX RTOS
to  the  needs of a next-generation multimedia convergence computer. At the same
time,  we  had  also  been  working  with  key members of the Linux community to
evaluate  the  pros  and  cons  of Linux. As we focused on building a successful
business  proposition,  it  became  apparent  to  us  that  more and more of our
technology  partners  and software vendors were encouraging us to focus on Linux
as our underlying OS kernel. While we were impressed with some of the technology
elements  in QNX (and BeOS and Chorus, for that matter), we felt that it will be
difficult  for  a  proprietary  operating  system  to attract the broad industry
support required to be successful over the coming years.

Linux  has  been picking up substantial momentum over the past year as a viable,
open  alternative to Windows in the marketplace. Over the past year, Linux usage
has  more  than tripled, with both large vendors and start-ups adopting Linux as
their  OS  foundation.  The growing commitment to Linux applications from a wide
variety  of  software  vendors,  and the growing development and availability of
Linux  device  drivers  from  hardware  and  peripheral  suppliers,  make  it  a
compelling choice. Also, as we ported our higher level operating environment and
AmigaObject   architecture  to  Linux,  we  discovered  significant  performance
advantages  in  the Linux kernel in areas such as distributed object invocation.
And,  no  small  advantage,  Linux  is probably the most stable operating system
available in the market.

For all of these reasons, we have decided to build the next-generation Amiga MCC
platform  on  top  of  a  Linux  OS  foundation.  We  would  be  remiss  in  not
acknowledging  that  there are issues to overcome with Linux, as there were with
all  of the other OS choices we evaluated. For example, there were concerns with
TCP/IP  performance,  which  are being resolved, and concerns about the required
disk  and memory footprint. As anyone knows who has looked at Linux, the overall
system is quite large. However, as we build our OS foundation, we are subsetting
Linux to meet our needs, and are now confident that disk and memory requirements
are  quite  reasonable  (Linux  is  starting  to  appear  in  a  wide variety of
information appliance devices, and there is even a version of Linux that runs on
the  Palm  Pilot!).  There  are also various other performance issues with Linux
that  we  are attacking - as with the original Amiga, we are tightly binding the
OS kernel to a specialized, high-performance hardware architecture that resolves
many  of  the  concerns that we, and the Amiga community, have had with existing
Linux  implementations.  The  momentum  building behind Linux, and the resources
around  the  world  being  applied  towards  fixing  various  issues,  gives  us
confidence that this will turn out in the end to be the right choice.

Graphics, Multimedia and GUI Frameworks

The  technology  strategy for graphics involves developing key partnerships with
companies   currently   producing  state-of-the-art  component  products.  Amiga
leverages  the development efforts of these organizations to deliver the product
capabilities  to  Amiga  customers.  For  example  Amiga  is working with ATI to
incorporate  next-generation  3D  rendering  technology  into  the  MCC (see the
Hardware Architecture section).

The widespread acceptance and momentum of OpenGL makes it the solid choice as a
3D API to exploit hardware rendering capability. In addition, the latest Java 2
releases have extended capabilities for 3D scene manipulation, advanced imaging,
and overall media coordination. AmigaObjects are being developed to give users
device-independent control of these various media through Java objects which in
turn access graphics hardware acceleration through OpenGL whenever possible or
appropriate. It is important to understand that, when discussing AmigaObject or
Java access to hardware-accelerated API's such as OpenGL, care is being taken to
ensure that the higher level software does not "get in the way" when accessing
the underlying hardware. As with the original Amiga, it is the tight integration
of software and hardware that provides overall system performance.

The  technology  strategy  for  multimedia  is essentially analogous to that for
graphics.  The  hardware  delivery  system  for  digital  multimedia may be a 3D
graphics engine, a DVD decoder including MPEG 2 and AC-3 digital surround sound,
or  broadband Internet. For a complete solution, the underlying hardware must be
powerful enough to both capture and play back audio/video streams. To accomplish
this,  Amiga  is developing partnerships with the leading hardware manufacturers
of  these  technologies.  AmigaObjects  are  being  developed to give developers
device-independent  control  through  Java.  The  Java-based AmigaObjects invoke
methods  to  access  appropriate  levels  of  special  hardware  assistance  and
acceleration.  In cases where there is not a widely accepted API such as OpenGL,
Amiga  and  partners  are  writing  a  number of these methods in native code as
necessary. As with 3D, a tight integration of software and hardware will provide
outstanding support for streaming media.

The  Information  Appliance  portion  of the Amiga Operating Environment will be
hosted  on  a  wide  range  of  devices,  and the interactional natures of these
devices can be expected to differ widely. It would be foolish to try to design a
single  interface  for  a  palm-sized  device  with  a  small,  touch-sensitive,
grayscale  display  and a relatively slow wireless network connection; a set-top
box  with  remote  control and TV display; and a traditional, multimedia desktop
computer  with  full  keyboard,  mouse,  high-resolution  monitor, and broadband
networking  -  it is doubtful that any single design could meet the needs of the
users  of  all  these devices. Instead, we are implementing a design environment
that  will  insure  a  clear sense of consistency of interaction across devices,
while  respecting  the  physical constraints of the device on which a particular
interface  appears. We will also minimize the effort to which developers must go
to create virtual appliances able to run on a wide range of products.

With  regard  to  windowing  environments  on the Amiga MCC, we are leveraging a
combination  of  technologies from Linux and Java. At the lowest level (managing
the  bits on the screen), we are using the latest Linux X Windows window system.
Most  users  and developers will never see X Windows directly (unlike older UNIX
systems,  when X Windows was somewhat cumbersome). However, the use of X Windows
will  allow  both  new  applications  and  standard  Linux  applications  to run
seamlessly  on  the  MCC. Sitting above X Windows are a growing number of window
managers that will be available on the MCC, and Java developers will have access
to  the  portable  Java  Swing  GUI  classes  that hide the underlying windowing
complexity  under  a modern programming model. Finally, there will be a suite of
end-user  workspaces,  including  a new Amiga Workbench being designed at Amiga.
There  are  already  a  number of interesting desktop environments available for
Linux, and it is our intent to contribute the Amiga workbench to the open source
movement,  and  encourage  the  creative  Amiga and Linux communities to modify,
enhance,  replace,  and  generally get creative when it comes to next-generation
desktop  environments  (we  believe  that  one  of  the disadvantages of today's
Windows and Macintosh personal computers is the "closed" nature of their desktop
environments).

Pervasive Networking

The  near  future will bring more high-speed broadband Internet service to homes
via cable modems, xDLS and other new technologies. The industry is standardizing
on  technologies  for  home  networking, giving consumers the ability to connect
products  throughout  the  home  using standard home wiring and wireless digital
high-speed options.

Amiga-enabled  products  will  support these standards and seamlessly connect to
each  other  while  leveraging  the  entire  home through our distributed object
technology.   We   are   integrating  emerging  standards  such  as  HomePNA  by
Broadcom/Epigram  into  the  Amiga  Operating  Environment, using standard phone
lines  in  North  America  homes.  Several initiatives are also being pursued in
Europe  and  Asia,  which  we continue to monitor. We are also investigating the
front-running   technologies   for   digital  wireless  networks  for  the  home
environment.  Most  regions  of  the  world will standardize on a form of 2.4Ghz
digital  wireless networking like that of Proxim's which we will support as they
become  adopted  by  the  industry.  With  the  new  Amiga object technology and
integration  of  these standards, the home will become "the computer", including
seamless high-speed connection to the Internet.

With  AmigaObjects  being  the foundation for all object services and supporting
distributive processing in the Amiga Operating Environment, networking naturally
becomes  pervasive.  There  is  no distinction between devices (e.g. hard disks)
found  local  to  a computing element or an equivalent device found somewhere on
the network. The JiniTM technology from Sun Microsystems addresses many of these
problems  with  an  architecture that enables instant connectivity of devices to
the  network  such  as  disk  drives,  printers,  scanners, cameras, etc. We are
encapsulating  Jini technology for the types of devices where it works well, and
are   providing  complete  AmigaObject  solutions  for  services  not  supported
effectively  by Jini. We'll provide more details on the pervasiveness of network
services at a later time.

The  actual  choice  of transport is unimportant to the software and application
architecture.  We  expect  to  support most of the popular networking standards,
such as Ethernet, modem, HomePNA, HomeRF, IEEE 1394 and other digital high speed
networking  over  time. The only real issue is one of bandwidth: lower bandwidth
connectivity  tends to limit the quality of services that can be offered. As you
can  see  from  the  hardware  section,  we're  actively  working  on  providing
high-bandwidth  networking in our base system, thereby enabling a new generation
of net-aware applications and products.

Amiga MCC Hardware Architecture

The  Amiga  MCC  is  being designed to support state-of-the-art multimedia while
leaving  the  PC  legacy baggage behind. The MCC will have DVD, high-performance
3D,  Ethernet-based  home  networking,  digital and traditional analog video and
audio,  and  USB ports for digital peripherals. It will have room for at least 2
hard  drives,  2  PCI  slots,  7  USB ports and an open drive bay for enthusiast
options such as Zip and Jazz drives.

There  is  significant  momentum for USB (Universal Serial Bus) in the industry.
USB  is  a  digital 2-way interface that supports up to 10Mb/s. This allows game
controllers  to  support  high-speed  interactivity,  including features such as
force  feedback so when you are driving the car the wheel will push back on you.
It  allows  hot  detection  of  devices  such  as keyboards, printers, scanners,
cameras,  game  controllers,  storage  devices,  etc.  In fact, the USB standard
supports  up  to  127  peripherals  on  a single port. For this reason we do not
intend  to  support  the legacy serial, parallel, PS/2 or analog game ports. You
can  always  add  USB hubs for more devices, and there are converters to the old
buses (e.g. USB to parallel) for your legacy peripherals that you might not want
to  get  rid  of  for a while. There are even efforts under way to make the next
version of USB work up to 100Mb/s.

The  industrial  design  for  the  MCC  has  been  done  by Pentagram, a leading
worldwide industrial design firm. Several concept sketches (out of approximately
12 that were considered) have been previously released, and the final industrial
design will be shown at the upcoming World of Amiga and AmiWest shows.

As the foundation and hub for the Amiga computing revolution, the Amiga MCC will
be  delivered  in two formats: an integrated computing system with an attractive
industrial  design  and  separate monitor option; and a standard size ATX format
motherboard  for  systems  vendors, software developers and enthusiasts who want
access to MCC functionality in other configurations with greater expandability.

We  have  selected  a  very exciting CPU for the MCC, which is at the heart of a
next-generation  processing  subsystem. The CPU subsystem will provide more than
just  traditional  central processing services - having chosen Linux and Java as
two  of our fundamental software building blocks, we wanted a CPU subsystem that
could be highly tuned for a Linux/Java software base, while also running classic
Amiga  applications.  We are still under strict confidentiality constraints, and
cannot  disclose information about the CPU at this time. However, we believe the
selection of this technology will give us a unique advantage for the Amiga.

As  mentioned  earlier, the MCC will include a very high-performance 3D graphics
subsystem, support for streaming media integration, and support for the emerging
home  networking  standards  that will become pervasive over the next two years.
Following  is  a  partial list of features under development in the MCC hardware
architecture:

Processing Subsystem:
   * High-performance next generation CPU
      o Hardware assist for Linux kernel, Java VM, and classic Amiga emulation
   * 168-pin SDRAM DIMMs -- future support for DDR SDRAM
   * 32MB System RAM expandable to 288MB (ATX goal to be expandable to 1GB)

Graphics Subsystem:
   * Advanced  SuperScalar  rendering  2D & 3D hardware accelerator (unannounced
     next-generation ATI chipset - specs still under non-disclosure):
      o  24-bit  true  color  depth  /  pixel  supporting  640x480  to 1920x1200
      resolutions
      o  Texture  lighting  & compositing, alpha blending, vertex- & table-based

Development Tools and Applications

We  are  working with several leading development tool and applications software
suppliers to ensure that there are great tools and applications for the Amiga OE
and the Amiga MCC. One of the key reasons that we chose Linux for the underlying
operating  system  of  the MCC is the tremendous growth in Linux-based tools and
applications,  many of which will be available for the Amiga MCC. Similarly, our
choice  of  Java  for  the Amiga OE was partly driven by the fact that there are
some  very  powerful  Linux-based  Java development environments that are either
already shipping, or will be shipping over the coming months. The Amiga MCC will
instantly be one of the best-selling Linux-based systems in the marketplace, and
it  is  the  intent  of  Amiga  and  its partners to ensure that these tools are
available on the MCC.

Obviously,  we  are  not  at  liberty  to  disclose  the  release plans of other
companies. As we move closer to the Amiga OE and Amiga MCC ship dates, companies
developing  applications  and  tools  for the new Amigas will announce their own
plans to release software for the Amiga.

Summary

We  believe  that  the  Amiga  Operating  Environment will power a wide range of
next-generation computing devices. The Amiga MCC as the foundation, will set the
standard  for  multimedia  convergence  computers in the emerging home computing
environment.

This  brief  in no way documents all that is happening at Amiga. We have several
exciting  things  in development that we would like to disclose to the community
and  will  as  our  partners  will  allow. The decisions that are being made are
focused  on  the future while keeping our eyes on today and yesterday. Hopefully
this brief has given you an insight to our direction.

@node not16 "OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY BY JIM COLLAS"

                   OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY BY JIM COLLAS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

July 16, 1999

Dear Amigans,

The  next  computer  revolution  is on the horizon. It is a revolution that will
unleash  the  full  power  of  computers  to  the masses and finally fulfill the
promises of the information age. It will create a new class of computing devices
that  combine  power and simplicity to make computers and the Internet a natural
part  of  everyday life. They will be exciting enough for the enthusiast and yet
simple  enough  for  the  common person. They will work seamlessly together in a
highly integrated operating environment encompassing the home, business, and the
world  through  the Internet. This is the future of computing and the reason why
we  can't  only develop an alternative computer platform. Faster CPUs and faster
graphics  alone  will  not drive a revolutionary new computer platform. They are
important but not revolutionary. Revolutionary thinking requires us to let go of
past preferences and envision a future that doesn't currently exist. It requires
us  to  develop technology and functions that enable this future vision. This is
the  spirit of revolutionary innovation. The same spirit that drove the original
Amiga development team.

We  need  the support of the Amiga community to drive this revolution. The Amiga
community is one of the most heroic, passionate, and innovative communities left
in  the  computer  industry. We need these attributes to succeed because we have
charted  a  bold  course. Like heroic explorers in the past, we can't discover a
new  continent  without  losing  sight of the old one for a long period of time.
This  makes  some people very uncomfortable and anxious but it is a prerequisite
of  discovery  and  innovation. Some of you will feel compelled to jump ship and
swim  for  familiar shores before we sail out of site. Most of you will stay for
the  excitement of the journey and the reward of discovery. For those of you who
are staying with the ship, tie down the hatches and get ready for the future.

Before you read the technology brief there are a few concepts that will help you
put  it  in  perspective.  One  is  a  high-level  view  of  the Amiga Operating
Environment  (OE). Instead of thinking of a single computer with hardware and an
operating  system,  I  would like you to start thinking about multiple computing
devices  integrated  together  into  a  single  large  "virtual" computer and an
"operating  environment" or OE to run this "virtual" computer. The OE seamlessly
integrates  multiple  computing  devices into a single, integrated, and seamless
operating  environment.  Like  the  OS  for  a  large "virtual" computer. The OE
includes  the  OS  for  single  computing  devices  but it also runs the overall
"virtual"  computer consisting of multiple computing devices networked together.
Every connected computing device is both a building block and a window into this
computing environment.

The  other  concept to understand is AmigaObject®. The AmigaObject is a powerful
software   structure  used  to  access  computing  functions  and  capabilities.
AmigaObjects are the main structures used to implement the Amiga OE. They enable
easy  integration  of  technology,  distributed  computing,  high-speed  network
transactions,  and  communication  between  applications  in  the  OE.  They are
powerful  software  building  blocks  that will allow people to build impressive
applications   quickly.   AmigaObjects  are  portable  and  transferable  across
platforms  allowing  AmigaObjects  to proliferate throughout the network and the
Internet.  Since AmigaObjects are transferable and accessible over the Internet,
you  can  easily  extend  the  Amiga  OE  through the Internet. This will become
critical  as  broadband  Internet  access becomes more and more prevalent in the
future.  AmigaObjects  are  implemented  using  Java and Jini technology but are
specifically  optimized to implement the Amiga OE. AmigaObjects will allow us to
build our revolutionary computer platform.

The  attached technology brief gives you some more detail on the next generation
Amiga.  Before  you  read  it,  I  have  to  strongly emphasize that we have not
released  some  of  the  most  strategic parts of our vision and technology. The
vision  of  how our technology unleashes the power of computing in the future is
compelling.  Unfortunately, communicating the complete vision at this time would
jeopardize  our  competitive  advantage  and  business success, especially if we
released  this  information  on  our  web  site.  I  hope you can understand how
important  it  is  for  us  to  keep  certain  strategic  information  from  our
competitors.  I  can  only say that all of the few people who have seen our full
vision have been extremely impressed. It is compelling and will drive the future
of  computing. I look forward to sharing more strategic details on the vision in
the months to come starting at WoA and AmiWest.

Sincerely,
Jim Collas
President, Amiga

      EXODUS ANNOUNCES THE FIRST AMIGANG-POWERED DIGITAL VIDEO WORKSTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exodus Multimedia is pleased to announce the first AmigaNG-powered digital video
workstation,  Maverick! While still in the design and engineering stage, we have
committed  to  delivering  this  exciting new concept to the video industry. Our
decision  to  proceed with this project was reached after a private meeting with
Jeff Schindler and Darreck Lisle at the St.Louis Amiga show.

After talks with Amiga Inc. which lasted into the early hours of the morning, it
was  decided  that the new OS offers significant advantages over other operating
systems,  in  terms  of  size,  speed,  reliability  and  flexibility.  From its
inception,  the  AmigaOS  was designed to handle full motion video, graphics and
animation.  The  AmigaNG version promises to improve on this base technology and
add  features  not seen on any other platform. Our current line of digital video
workstations  is based on Windows 98 and NT plus the Newtek Video Toaster Flyer.
While  we  are  very  early  into  this  project,  we will provide more concrete
specifications  by  summer's  end.  The  tower case will be based on the current
design  used  on  our standard workstation, pictures of which can be seen on our
web page at www.exodusmm.com.

"The  Amiga  has proven to be the leading OS for video production on a large and
small  scale.  To  this day, there are 15 year old Amigas still being used to do
mainsteam  video,  while  most other computing platforms are obsolete within two
years.  It  is  our  goal  to take Maverick into the 21st century with an OS and
hardware  capable  of supporting new standards like HDTV, DV and MPEG-2 all with
realtime  video effects and transitions. The AmigaOS gives us that power!", said
Stan Carver, President of Exodus Multimedia.

From  the  last  poll, there were over 7 million Classic Amigas sold to date. To
show  our  support for the Classic Amigas, we have been working with Mick Tinker
of Access Innovation, a European company, to provide a state of the art solution
that  would  allow  current  Amiga  owners to take advantage of new technologies
without sacrificing backwards compatibility. Based on specifications provided by
Exodus  Multimedia, the new motherboard will have a PowerPC processor, PCI slots
and  fast  SDRAM,  in addition to Amiga specific devices like Zorro slots and an
high speed emulation of the custom chipset. Full Video Toaster and Flyer support
will  be provided as well. The use of new technologies will make way for devices
currently  on  the Windows platform such as FireWire, USB, pro audio sound cards
and high end graphics cards to be easily ported to the AmigaOS without having to
redesign  hardware.  The  new  Amiga-powered  Maverick  should  be available 3rd
quarter 1999.

In the meantime, we have salesmen and service technicians that are fully capable
of  supporting  the  Amiga  community,  as  we  always  have.  We are now taking
pre-orders  for  OS  3.5  and  look  forward to the new AmigaNG with all of it's
possibilities.  We  will  post  details on our web page as we progress with this
project- STAY TUNED!

@node not21 "NOTE FROM THE AMIGA R&D TEAM"

                          NOTE FROM THE AMIGA R&D TEAM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Rick LeFaivre (rickl@amiga.com)

Very  interesting  and  active  debate  over  the  past two weeks. We *love* the
passion  of  (most  of  ;-))  the on-line community. Linux? X-Windows? PCI? USB?
MIDI? Floppy Drive? ATI graphics, etc., etc. While an overwhelming percentage of
our  email  is quite positive about Amiga's directions, there are those who have
raised  quite legitimate technical concerns, and a small percentage who are just
bashing everything we do (more on them later).

One  positive  aspect  of the Linux announcement is the huge influx of technical
talent into the Amiga camp from the Linux community. There are legitimate issues
with Linux, as anyone with a technical background will acknowledge. One positive
aspect  of  the  Linux  phenomenon  is  that  there are hundreds of thousands of
programmers  out there working to fix those problems. There are also hundreds of
companies  working on applications and drivers (and hardware) for Linux, that we
can  immediately tap into. Yes, there are integration and testing issues to work
on,  but  there  are many, many more positives than negatives. Please understand
that  the  Linux  decision  was  not  purely  (actually  not mostly) a technical
decision.  It was a decision driven by a reasoned analysis of what underlying OS
would  give  Amiga  the  greatest chance to succeed in the marketplace, and as a
company.

Also understand that we have not yet seen a single technical issue raised in the
news  groups  that  we are not already aware of, and working on either inside of
Amiga  or  through partners. Will the Amiga MCC under development be perfect? Of
course  not  -- product development is all about tradeoffs. When it is shipping,
will it be at the heart of the best distributed multimedia computing environment
in  the  marketplace  in  terms  of  price/performance/usability? Yes! Even more
important,  the  MCC  is  only one piece of a much broader strategy that we have
chosen  to not really discuss yet. When Jim Collas talks about revolutions, it's
not  a  revolution  in  terms of what happens to be inside the MCC box (although
some  of the unannounced components are, indeed, revolutionary); it's the entire
distributed  home  computing/Internet  environment  and  experience that will be
revolutionary  as  it  rolls out over the coming year. DON'T JUST FOCUS ON BOXES
AND OPERATING SYSTEMS! (sorry for shouting.)

So,  to  those of you raising legitimate technical concerns, we will do our best
to  communicate solutions as they are worked out. Better yet, help us track down
those  solutions.  Linux  is  getting  better  every  week,  with issues getting
resolved   at  an  amazing  pace.  ATI  may  not  be  able  to  ship  their  new
graphics/video  accelerator  (which  looks great) on time, and rest assured that
we're  also  looking  at  3dfx  and  NVidea.  Yes,  there will be a floppy drive
(probably a 1.44MB / 120MB combo). We're working on the sound/MIDI requirements.
We're  listening  to  proactive  suggestions, and will do our best to manage the
inevitable tradeoffs to create the best next-generation system we can.

To  the  small  number  of individuals who have been sending vulgar, threatening
hatemail because you don't like what we're doing, and have announced that you're
fed  up  and  are leaving the Amiga community, goodbye. Millions and millions of
people  will purchase Amiga-branded and Amiga-compliant products over the coming
years, and we're sorry you won't be among them.

Rick LeFaivre, Allan Havemose, and the Amiga R&D Team

              AMIGA ANNOUNCES RELATIONSHIP WITH COREL CORPORATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

July  22,  1999  -  San  Diego California - Today, Amiga announced that they are
working  closely  with Corel Corporation to insure that several of Corel's award
winning  software applications will be supported on Amiga's new line of products
that are scheduled for release later this year.

This  announcement  follows  Amiga's recent announcement that they have selected
Linux  as  the  OS  kernel  for  the  new  Amiga  Operating Environment. "We are
extremely  excited  about  our  relationship with Corel and their entire product
line",  said  Jim  Collas,  President  and  CEO of Amiga, "This insures that our
customers  who  purchase  the  new  Amiga systems will have world class personal
productivity applications such as the upcoming WordPerfect Office for Linux."

Customers  have  made over 1 million download attempts for Corel® WordPerfect® 8
for  Linux®  since  Corel  made  the  product  available  on their web site last
December. "We expected the Linux version to do well," said Dr. Michael Cowpland,
Chief  Executive  Officer  and  President  of  Corel,  "but one million download
attempts  is  extraordinary.  Not  only does it speak volumes for WordPerfect, I
think  it  is  somewhat indicative of the growing popularity of Linux. We expect
the release of WordPerfect Office for Linux will be an even greater success when
we release it early next year."

As Amiga approaches the release dates of the new Amiga Operating Environment and
the  Amiga  MCC  (Multimedia  Convergence  Computer), we will be announcing more
details on these and other products and their availability dates.

@node not23 "FOUNDATION SUPPORT PAGE CLOSED"

                         FOUNDATION SUPPORT PAGE CLOSED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is the full announcement regarding the ending of support for Foundation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20th July 1999

The  End:  Now that Foundation is no longer commercially available and the games
publishers - Sadeness - are no longer available, I - regrettably - have to bring
further  development  of  the  game  to a close. There will be at least one more
update  as  I clean up a few last rough edges but Foundation has come to the end
of  the road. I will do all I can to release the game in FULL in the near future
so  if  you  didn't  get  the chance to buy the game, watch this space! (Sorry I
can't  comment  or give any information regarding Sadeness. I wish I knew, trust
me!)

Problems:  Over  the past six months I have been working on various projects for
Amiga,  PC  and for a popular 'game console'. I've not had much time for further
Foundation development despite the fact that I did have some more major features
to  implement.  The  lack of spare time for Foundation and the total stoppage of
royalty  payments  (which  ended  in  1998)  has  given me no alternative but to
prioritize my efforts in an attempt to survive for a brighter future.

Foundation 2: There will not be a sequel to Foundation but I am making plans for
a  technical  successor  to  the  game. I'm currently looking into the Specs and
limited  developer information for the upcoming Amiga MMC. I'm working on a plan
to  design  the  perfect  networked strategy game for the new Millennium. I will
certainly  salvage  a  great  deal of concepts from Foundation but there will be
many  ruthless  design  changes  in  order  to  bring  things upto the necessary
standard.

Time  Scale:  As mentioned earlier, I have some existing project commitments and
some  deadlines  to  keep to. This new strategy game will remain in the planning
stages  until  the  end of 1999. The Amiga MMC will make development MUCH easier
that  it  was  when  Foundation was first created. There wont me a wide range of
specification  problems and I wont be developing it on a 16Meg, 40Mhz system! So
the rough time scale I have in mind is approx. 1 years open development.

Design  Philosophy:  I  have  no  strong  desire  to create a high-tech super-3D
real-time strategy-fest affair. I prefer to setup some basic strategy ideas in a
clean good looking environment with an easy to use control system. I can imagine
very  large  maps with complex terrain including hills, cliffs, rivers, bridges,
walls  etc.  Each  map  would require a great deal of design which is not easily
achieved  with  random map generation. The pace of gameplay would be faster than
most  strategy  games;  players would enter and leave the map as readily as they
would  in  an FPS game such as Quake or Unreal. Typical games could last from 10
minutes  up  to  half  an  hour  although  length  of  play  wouldn't be heavily
restricted.  (I  don't  have  the space to list a full design spec here. This is
just a rough philosophy for the game; more details will appear at a later date)

Ideal Situation: The ideal way to develop this game concept is to bring the game
up  to  a  playable  beta  version after approx. 8 months work. There would then
follow  a period of open testing and development until a restricted demo version
is  released.  From that point on, there would follow at least 12 more months of
FULL  TIME  development as the game would advance based on user feedback. I will
make  no  effort to hide the fact that this game will be aimed at the popular PC
systems  as  well  as the Amiga MMC. The potential userbase is many times bigger
than that which Foundation could have reached and so the commercial viability of
the project should provide better support and longer development time.

And  Finally:  I  understand  that I have given very little info away so far and
this  new game wont see the light for quite some time. I just wanted to clear up
the  situation  regarding  Foundation  development  and  my plans for a brighter
future!

Thank you,
Paul Burkey

                                   FUBAR NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Andrew  King  (bartman@rosande.nu)  of  Rosande  Limited,  developers of the war
strategy  game  FUBAR,  has informed us that the 2nd alpha of the game is just a
few days away, so I'd better tell you what you can expect from it.

The main news of the development of FUBAR is that FUDGE is complete. In case you
don't  know  what  FUDGE  is,  it  (FUbar  Development  enGinE) is a programming
language which allows anyone to program a 2D game using the FUBAR engine.

The  good  news  is that it is complete. Documentation for it though is a little
thin on the ground at the moment, but this is due to be resolved very soon.

As  FUBAR now can read and execute FUDGE object code, you can compile sources in
FUDGE and then pass them over to FUBAR for execution. And it's pretty quick too,
since it's compiled and not interepreted (like AMOS for example).

An alpha version is currently available. More info at www.rosande.nu

              PHASE 5 DIGITAL PRODUCTS ANNOUNCES THE AMIRAGE © K2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oberursel,  July  22,  1999:  phase 5 digital products today proudly announces a
first  product  of  a  new  series of multimedia computers, the new AMIRAGE © K2
multimedia  computer which will provide breathtaking features and functionality.
This  new  system  will  finally  realize  a  vision  of  computing for the next
millenium,  which  phase 5 digital products has shared with many Amiga users and
supporters of innovative concepts.

"Based  on our license agreement with QNX Software Systems Ltd., we are now able
to  provide  our  customers  with  a powerful realtime OS with all the necessary
functionality  -  and  much  more  -  that can make a next-generation multimedia
computer  fly"  says Wolf Dietrich, General Manager of phase 5 digital products.
"The  lack  of  a decent OS, which can support our hardware vision, has been the
major  reason  that earlier projects for stand-alone systems at phase 5 had been
put  on  hold.  That problem is solved by integrating the QNX Neutrino OS, so we
now   can  push  forward  our  demanding  vision  of  a  new  powerful  computer
generation."

The  new  AMIRAGE  ©  K2  computer  system supports full multi-processing and is
already  in  it's  base configuration expandable with additional CPUs. More than
that,  distributed  processing  through  different  networks is fully supported,
allowing  the  realization  of a new vision of computing, including distributed,
internet-aware  applications  and services. The AMIRAGE © K2 computer will be an
expandable  power-horse  for all kind of creative computing and multimedia, with
many  upgrading  options  and interfaces for third-party add-ons, and offer full
compliance with the major industry and digital multimedia standards.

As  the new QNX Neutrino OS will also become available for all PowerUP© upgrades
for  Amiga  computers  developed  by  phase  5 digital products (please read the
respective  announcement  here), a smooth upgrade path and full Amiga 3.x legacy
support  is  provided  both for end users and developers of the existing PowerUP
product  line  from phase 5 digital products. With this stunning feature set, it
is  expected  to  see  a  large  number of next-generation applications, running
natively  under the QNX Neutrino OS on the AMIRAGE © K2 computer to be available
with  the release of the new system, which is scheduled for the beginning of the
year 2000.

"We  are  excited that we finally can create a product technology which we could
not  realize  in  the past, due to the lack of OS support and a competition with
non-existing  but  announced  projects,  which we were faced with" outlines Wolf
Dietrich.  "The  new  AMIRAGE  ©  K2 design extends the proposed features of our
older  pre\box project, and contains many elements of the earlier A\BOX concept,
but  without  the neccessity to design customized hardware right now. As the QNX
Neutrino  OS concept is also in full accordance with our vision of a new OS - in
the  past  and  today - we feel that we finally can make the dream of many Amiga
users as well as other computer users come true."

The  AMIRAGE  ©  K2  computer  system  will be built around the latest available
technologies, and support the major standards in digital multimedia. Although it
will  not  be  designed as a low-cost system, it will be very reasonably priced,
and  will  be surprisingly attractive in respect of the price/performance ratio.
The currently planned key features of the AMIRAGE © K2 include:

   * One  to  four  PowerPC  G4  processors,  user-upgradable  with  standard G4
     processor  modules,  each with independent CPU clock frequency, allowing to
     scale-fit  the  system  to any particular requirement (users who e.g. start
     with  one  400MHz CPU can later add e.g. a 700MHz CPU and nearly triple the
     system performance transparently; this is the case for all the four CPUs as
     well)
   * Full  QNX  Neutrino support for the symmetric multiprocessing functionality
     of  the  AMIRAGE © K2 allows applications to make full and dynamical use of
     the installed CPUs
   * The multiprocessing functionality of the AMIRAGE © K2 allows to immediately
     scale the system to performance levels of approximately 80 SPECInt95 and 80
     SPECfp95,  plus a most impressive multimedia performance provided by the up
     to four Altivec units of the G4 processors.
   * Up to two GByte main memory by use of fast SDRAM (industry standard DIMMs);
     base configuration comes with 64 MB installed
   * High-performance   local   3D  graphics,  by  use  of  a  latest-generation
     leading-edge  3D  processor,  with  a  minimum of 32 MB display and texture
     memory,  resolutions  of  1920x1080  in  32bit  color  depth or better, and
     hardware video acceleration to support full-screen, full-frame DVD playback
   * Integrated  Ultra-DMA  ATA Controller; base configuration comes with 6GByte
     hard drive and DVD-ROM drive
   * Optional ULTRA-2-WIDE SCSI Controller
   * High-Speed IEEE1394 Interface for external devices and networking
   * Dedicated  port for optional, internal Solid State Drive (SSD, up to 128 MB
     capacity)
   * ISBEE  ©  (Instant  System  Boot on External Event) activates the system on
     user-definable  external  events  such  as  incoming signals (e.g. modem or
     ISDN)  or  calls, or other events; when used with a SSD, the system will be
     fully operational within seconds
   * Two independent 12MBit USB port
   * Three 64-bit PCI slots, 66MHz, for high-performance add-on boards
   * Three 32-bit PCI slots, 33 MHz, for low-cost add-on boards
   * Twisted-pair 10Base100 Ethernet port
   * IrDa interface and MIDI ports
   * Integrated   powerful   multimedia   coprocessor   with   specialized   DSP
     functionality,   independent   VLD  (variable  length  decoder)  and  image
     coprocessor   for   CPU-independent  video  scaling  and  filtering,  color
     conversion,  overlay, alpha blending and bit mask blanking of digital video
     signals
   * Digital  Video  In Port for digital video input in CCIR601 / CCIR656 format
     (eight-bit  parallel,  4:2:2  YUV time-multiplexed video data) from devices
     such as a digital video camera or digital video decoder.
   * Digital Video Out Port outputs digital YUV data-stream to devices such as a
     digital  video  encoder  chips,  digital video recorder, or other CCIR601 /
     CCIR656-compatible device
   * Video  output  supports  129-level  alpha  blending,  genlock  mode,  frame
     synchronization, chroma key and programmable YUV color clipping
   * Dedicated expansion options (video slots) allow to add analog frontends for
     the  digital  video  ports,  either  in  consumer, prosumer or professional
     versions
   * 16-bit stereo audio input, analog or digital
   * 16-bit analog stereo audio output
   * Eight-channel digital audio output, 16-bit or 32-bit stereo format
   * Dolby  ProLogic ® and Dolby Digital (AC-3) ® multichannel audio decoder and
     output (digital)
   * SPDIF  output  supports  two-channel  linear  PCM  audio, one or more Dolby
     Digital  six-channel  datastreams,  or  one  or more MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 audio
     streams with programmable sample rates
   * Synchronous  serial  interface  (SSI)  provides  fully V.34-compliant modem
     capability, and optional ISDN services and interface
   * Software  support:  System  Services  by  the QNX Neutrino OS, including an
     Amiga  OS  3.x  legacy  support  package;  3D  support by OpenGL compatible
     libraries;   emulation   for   industry-standard  applications  from  other
     platforms planned

     Note:  These  specifications are subject to change with ongoing progress in
     the computer industry, and will be updated to meet the latest standards.

With  it's  extensive  features  and  impressive multimedia functionalities, the
AMIRAGE  ©  K2  is  a powerful personal workstation for all purposes. But beyond
that,  it  will  also  be the first fully-featured Personal Network&Media Server
that will function as a heart of a new generation of computing. "AMIRAGE © K2 is
not  designed  to  only impress with a potential hardware overkill. We do hear a
lot  about  new applications and even revolutions in the computer industry these
days.  We at phase 5 digital products also believe that computing will differ in
the  future,  and  new  services  will  be  expected by the users" comments Wolf
Dietrich.  "But  still the necessary hardware functionality counts, to make such
new  services available. If you e.g. want your multimedia and 3D data streams to
appear somewhere else than on your local monitor, than a typical 3D display card
that  outputs  a  single high-frequency analog signal, which allows a maximum of
1.5  meters  shielded  cable,  is not very helpful. For such applications, fully
digital  processing  units  -  as provided with the AMIRAGE © K2's processor and
coprocessor  units  - and networking capabilities are needed to process the data
and distribute it to any device or appliance that can communicate with the user.
The  hardware  of the AMIRAGE © K2, as well as the superior functionality of the
QNX   Neutrino   OS,   perfectly   meet   the  requirements  of  such  demanding
next-generation applications."

Consequently,  in the 2nd quarter of 2000, phase 5 digital products will release
a  first  external  extension, the AMIRAGE © LCU, which is a Local Communication
Unit. This small and very inexpensive device will be used to provide local video
and  audio  output  on separate monitors, TV sets, or other video/audio devices.
The  audio  and video streams are provided as digital data streams (in different
digital  formats,  depending  on the actual content, e.g. as MPEG Audio/Video or
lossless compressed for the display of digital screens) by the AMIRAGE © K2. The
AMIRAGE  ©  LCU  also  accepts  inputs  via  an IrDa interface, e.g. from remote
controls  or  keyboards,  to  allow full interaction. It is currently planned to
connect the LCU via the IEEE-1394 port. As multiple LCUs can be connected to the
AMIRAGE  ©  K2,  it  is  possible  to  display video and output audio on various
devices,  including  the  simultaneous  output of different audio/video streams;
thus,  it  is  e.g.  possible  that  different persons in a house watch a video,
browse  the  internet,  hold a videoconference, and play a 3D game independently
and  simultaneously (or play an interactive game together, for example). This is
just  a  first example of what will be possible from the synergy of the superior
QNX  Neutrino  OS  and  the powerful AMIRAGE © K2 hardware platform from phase 5
digital  products. Also under consideration are inexpensive and wireless webpads
and hand-held communication devices for videoconfering/videophoning, with lowest
power  consumption,  which  use the AMIRAGE © K2's communication functionalities
and data processing and distribution capabilities.

The  new  AMIRAGE  ©  K2  computer  system  is  scheduled  for shipment with the
beginning  of  the  year 2000. The pricing of the base system is TBD and will be
determined later this year. More information will be published regularly; please
visit www.phase5.de/aniga often and check for updates, mailings lists, and other
news.

                      PHASE5 AND THE AMIGA® LEGACY SUPPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

phase  5  digital  products will provide full Amiga® OS 3.x legacy support under
the  QNX  Neutrino  OS  for  PowerUP©.  The  existing  Amiga®  OS  3.x (and it's
applications)  will  be  running  under a powerful 68k emulator, which runs as a
fully  memory-protected  application under the Neutrino kernel. A new version of
the   PPC   library  will  provide  full  compatibility  with  existing  PowerPC
applications  which  make use of the message system of the PPC library, and call
threads  under  the  QNX  Neutrino  OS  to  execute the PowerPC code. Similarly,
updated  drivers  for  CyberGraphX  and  the CyberSCSI device will directly call
native GFX and SCSI drivers under the QNX Neutrino OS, thus providing native PPC
execution and increased stability with full memory protection again. By this new
software  implementation,  the  current PowerUP© Accelerator boards will provide
increased  performance  and usability for many applications, and will also serve
as  development  systems  for  software  developers writing applications for the
AMIRAGE©  K2  next-generation  multimedia  computer  systems  by phase 5 digital
products, which will be running the QNX Neutrino OS.

The  new  QNX  Neutrino  OS for PowerUP© and next-generation multimedia computer
systems,  including  the  Amiga® OS 3.x / 68k emulation system, will be shipping
with  the  new  Blizzard and Cyberstorm G3 Accelerators, which are scheduled for
delivery  by  end  of September 99. For all users of the installed 603/604 based
PowerUP©  boards,  the  complete software package will be available for free via
internet download, or on CD against a fee covering handling and postage.

With  an installed base of appx. 10,000 systems, the PowerUP© accelerators today
represent  a  small,  but  very  respectable starting base for all active Amiga®
developers  to port and update their applications to the new QNX Neutrino OS for
PowerUP©,  and improve them with new functionality. With the new next-generation
multimedia  computer  systems,  a rapidly growing market for innovative software
developers  will  emerge  early  in  the  year 2000. phase 5 digital products is
strongly  encouraging developers to port applications to the new QNX Neutrino OS
for  PowerUP©  and  next-generation multimedia computer systems. A new developer
contact at phase 5 digital products will be installed by end of August 99.

       QNX AND PHASE 5 TEAM UP TO PROVIDE MIGRATION PATH FOR AMIGA USERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kanata, Canada and Oberursel, Germany - July 22, 1999 - QNX Software Systems and
phase  5 digital products have announced a licensing agreement that allows phase
5  to port the QNX Neutrino OS to its current line of PowerUPTM accelerators for
Amiga computers.

Once  the  port is completed, the two companies will donate a runtime version of
the  OS  free  of  charge  to  the Amiga community. This version will run on all
current 603/604-based PowerUP boards.

"By  teaming  up  with  the  leading manufacturer of hardware upgrades for Amiga
computers,  we're  taking  the  next step in our growing commitment to the Amiga
community,"  said  Dan  Dodge,  CTO  at QNX Software Systems. "More importantly,
Amiga  developers  will  benefit in at least two ways. First, they can use their
existing  Amiga  computers  to  develop  next-generation multimedia applications
based  on  the  QNX  Neutrino OS. QNX application development will be completely
self-hosted;   no  PCs  required.  Second,  they  can  run  their  legacy  Amiga
applications  and  new QNX applications simultaneously, thanks to a powerful 68k
emulator from phase 5, which will provide Amiga OS 3.x support."

"QNX  provides  all  the  software  functionality  -  and  more - to fulfill the
expectations of the many users who still believe in the original Amiga vision: a
vision  of  technical  superiority,  innovation,  and just plain fun," said Wolf
Dietrich,  general  manager  of  phase 5 digital products. "By putting all these
features, OS services, and tools straight into the hands of Amiga developers, we
expect  that a large number of applications running under QNX for PowerUP boards
will be released quickly."

Phase  5  also has the option to license QNX for future standalone systems based
on next-generation PowerPC processors.

Availability  The  QNX  Neutrino  OS for PowerUP boards, including applications,
windowing  system,  drivers,  and Amiga 68k emulation system, will ship with the
new  phase  5  Blizzard  and Cyberstorm G3 accelerators, which are scheduled for
delivery in Fall 99.

For  users  of  current 603/604-based PowerUP boards, the ported runtime package
will be available for free download via the Internet, or on CD for a nominal fee
(to cover handling and postage).

                               WOA IS (WAS) HERE!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a preview of the World of Amiga written on Friday by Andrew Korn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Friday 23rd July 1999. World of Amiga is here!

Friday  23rd  (set  up  day)  went with surprisingly few hitches and the show is
looking  very,  very nice indeed. The exhibitiors (and a few hangers - on) spent
the day getting everything ready, and it's going to be pretty special.

Amiga's  stand is, to quote Petro Tyschtschenko, "the best one yet" with a video
wall  showing a continuous programme of demonstrations and videos throughout the
day,  a  (very  lovely  looking!)  mock  up of the next generation Amiga, and of
course  copious quantities of AmiCola, Boing socks and Boing boxers. Jim Collas,
Petro,  Dr  Allan  Havemose,  Dr  Rick LeFaivre and Tom Schmidt of Amiga will be
drinking  AmiCola and chatting to showgoers throughout the weekend, but they are
far from the only attraction.

A  lot  of  new  products  are  on sale, and many more developments are on show,
including.  There  will  be  announcements  of the launch date of (amongst other
things)  Amigactive  magazine and a new NG Amiga title from Digital Illusions to
whet your appetite for the big presentation from Jim Collas and Rick LeFaivre on
Saturday  evening. We have taken delivery of two 41" screens for some incredible
big  screen  multi-player  gaming  action  in  the  arcade, where many copies of
ClickBOOM's quake guide will be given away to contestants.

Other  prizes  will  be  raffled off to show goers over the weekend, including 5
copies  of  the  4  CD  Aminet Set 8 from Weird Science and 3 fully tooled A1200
towers  from  Eyetech.  There  is a programme of how-to practical demonstrations
running throughout the weekend, and a various Amiga luminaries will be running a
fascinating seminar programme.

The  big  event  on  Friday  evening  was  a mass trip to the local Odeon to see
Phantom  Menace,  mostly visitors from European countries where the film has yet
been released. World weary and cynical locals mostly just did the sensible thing
and enjoyed a few pints around the corner. Expect to see lots of excited Germans
holding  mock  light-sabre  battles  in  the  Amiga  Exhibition Hall and lots of
bleary-eyed Brits heading upstairs or down to one of the WoA '99 bars for a hair
of the dog.

There  is  so much going on at WoA'99 that we are regretting having so much in -
there's  far  too  much  to see in just one weekend! Don't miss out on the best,
most  historic  Amiga show in years, make sure you come along if you can. If you
are  too  far  away  to  travel, you can get share some of the WoA'99 experience
through  the  weekend  long  internet  coverage  provided  through  the  UGN  at
ugn.amiga.org/events/woa99.shtml. Be there - in real life or on the 'net, but be
there, you won't want to miss this!

@node not31 "FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF FOUNDATION RESTORED"

                   FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF FOUNDATION RESTORED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things  got  changed!  Paul Burkey visited WOA and had a discussion with another
Amiga  publishing  house  regarding  the  future  of  Foundation.  Read the full
announcement here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Latest News, Foundation Rescued! July 25th 1999

Last  week  saw the end of Foundation development and the closure of the Support
site  due  to the ceasing of funds and the disappearance of the games publisher,
Sadeness.  At  this  years  World  of Amiga show I had a discussion with another
Amiga  publishing house regarding the future of Foundation as well as the future
of the Amiga itself. We decided that it was a shame to see Foundation fizzle out
after  such  a  short commercial shelf-life, especially when we are about to see
the Amiga make a BIG return.

Foundation will also make BIG return towards the end of 1999. This will not be a
simple  re-release of the game, it will be heavily targeted towards those people
who  bought  and enjoyed the original Foundation and it will be designed to meet
the  needs of the modern (and future) Amiga. No exact plans have been set out as
yet  (as I write this announcement the WoA is still running) but a rough list of
targets are:

   * Total rewrite in portable C++
   * 68K and PPC support (other OS/CPU options to be considered)
   * All new Levels
   * Complete in-game GUI redesign
   * Complete Graphics overhaul
   * Gameplay restructure
   * New in-game features
   * New sound and music
   * Much more!

I  don't want to make any promises I can not keep and I must stress that a short
development  time schedule dictates that I will certainly have to take care with
which new features I implement. This includes the TCP/IP mode. However, this new
publishing  deal  means  that financial support for future game development will
return  and  TCP/IP  mode would be on the top of the list for the first Updates.
The  important matter is the game-play will be restructured to make the addition
of TCP/IP more important.

Towards  the end of the year there will be a Demo released. It will be from this
Demo  that I would like you to judge the validity of the new product. It is easy
to  fill  a  web page with a list of features. Now the real hard work must begin
and I hope you enjoy the results.

More details will be announced soon including the new Publisher.

@node not32 "FIRST SHOGO PROGRESS REPORT"

                          FIRST SHOGO PROGRESS REPORT

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperion have just put there first progress report for Shogo online, a full copy
of this can be found below:

INTRODUCTION

When we started, our first efforts were to concentrate on analysing the code. We
tried  to  work  through the concepts, and come up with solutions to problems we
found.  The  first  port we'll do is the Amiga port, as it's the system where we
have  the  most  expertise.  The  Mac  version will be done when we have a fully
working  Amiga  version,  the endian problems will be sorted out until then, and
the  renderer  will  probably  be  OpenGL,  so  all  that's  left  to  do is the
system-speciffic code.

As  it  was  clear  that  we  will  have -with exception of the renderer- a 100%
compile soon, we started working parallel on the functionality. In this field we
started  mainly on the server. We are currently putting finishing touches to it.
We  intend  to  compile  a stand-alone server first to connect a PC client to an
Amiga server for easier debugging of the system-dependent parts. This also saves
us  the  hassle of first compiling a renderer, which will most likely be written
from scratch. Also, the server does not include too much system dependent stuff.

.REZ  file  management  is now endian-aware as far as file headers are concerned
(no data is interpreted during REZ file loading).

The  ClientShell part is more or less complete, as is the ObjectsDLL minus a few
glitches  during linking which will be fixed soon, see below under "Problems and
Solutions".  A  certain  amount  of  work  was  invested  to even out a few VC++
specialities and dependencies, as well as a few points that our compiler was too
picky to overlook.

PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

ClientShell and ObjectsDLL

Most  of  these compile -actually ObjectsDLL already compiles fully. The message
handling  is  still  a bit doubtful due to the necessity for byteswapping. Since
some  data  is  only passed through the message system without interpretation of
the  actual  data, a bit of additional work has to be invested to assure correct
data alignment.

Some files that have dependencies on MFC or DirectX still need to be handled. We
intend to go for Clawbert first, since it will be less of a hassle and still run
the entire LithTech engine.

Input

Neither  the  Amiga nor the Mac has DirectInput, so a replacement for this needs
to  be  coded.  In this case no direct replacement of DirectInput was coded, but
the  InputMgr  was re-coded instead. It's 98% system independent, so it can also
be  used  on  the  Mac version (and not only on the Amiga version, where the new
InputMgr Code is currently implemented). Update: It's finished and working!

Sound

This is the second big problem. It consists of two parts. One is the sound-files
inside the LithTech WIN Directory (which is basically ported), the other one are
the  underlying  sound-libraries. Certain functions -like 3D Sound- do not exist
for  the  Amiga,  and the recoding of the required sound library is currently in
progress.

Video

There  is  no  .SMK  for  the  Amiga.  We  have  a  few  possible  solutions for
replacements,  but  have not decided yet which is the better one. We will decide
this at the end.

Renderer

Work  on the Renderer did not yet start. We now have a set of functions, though,
which are sort of a "bridge" between Direct3D and Warp3D, the 3D Hardware System
of  the  Amiga.  Warp3D  and Rave3D are rather similar, so this code could -with
changes-  also be of profit for the Mac Version. But before detailed work on the
Renderer  is done we want to finish a working Server. We are also considering an
OpenGL-Renderer,  which  we  will  develop  on the PC. That way, we can test and
debug it in an environment guaranteed to work.

Server

As  the server is the most urgent current work, it gets an extra chapter in this
report.  The  main problems in the Amiga port for the server were - and we think
other  systems  will  get  similar problems here. After all we tried to keep the
code as OS-independent as possible:
 * The  CPP_EngineObjects_DE.cpp  had  quite some problems which conflicted with
   our  compiler, We could solve this only by splitting the file into two files,
   basically  the  CPP_EngineObject_DE.cpp  and the engineobjects.c in API/. The
   main  problem  were  conflicting storage classes which prevented a strict C++
   Compiler  from  compiling  the source. With our compiler we have to choose to
   compile the whole project as C++ or as C, we cannot mix.
 * There  were  also  some function pointer references to member functions which
   our  compiler  did  not  accept  despite them being static. We could fix this
   problem though.
 * A  major  problem  was  the  file  serverobj_de.h with all it's macros. These
   problems are now solved.
 * The  concept  of  dynamic  libraries  is  different  in Windows and Amiga/Mac
   systems. Currently we are using static linking for testing. We have developed
   a  concept  for  dynamic  linking  based  on shared libraries and an implicit
   function  table  (like in the Windows DLLs), which we will use once the basic
   porting is done.
 * The  case  of  endian  problems concerning the message functions. It is often
   unclear what the datatype of the sent data is.

@node not33 "WOA (BRIEF COMMENTS)"

                          WOA (BRIEF COMMENTS)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Keith Blakemore-Noble " <Amiga@computer.org>

Just  got  back  from  WoA,  and here's some brief comments based on some of the
presentations, and speaking to some of the exhibitors and H&P and Amiga folks...

The  show  was  not  very  busy  on  Sunday, but apparantly was rather packed on
Saturday (I'm glad I went on Sunday :) ).

CPU  -  it  will be Transmeta. Amiga are not allowed to make any annoucements to
that  effect,  and  are not allowed to make any attributable comments, but it is
Transmeta (I think we'd all guessed that already :) ).

MMC  -  to  be released by the end of this year, albeit in limited quantities to
start with.

The MMC will be in the case we've seen on the web (the case they demo'd at WoA),
although  Amiga will also be selling uncased motherboards, both to end users and
to OEMs so they can build up customised Amigas (e.g. in towers or whatever).

There  will  be a developer version released, probably a bit earlier, more about
this in a moment.

As  has been speculated and discussed here, AmigaObjects is a system designed to
run  on  a wide range of systems, ranging from computers through to DVD players,
HiFis,  TVs,  palmtops,  et  al,  all of which can communicate and appear as one
device  from teh user's point of view. (A couple of examples were given, such as
using  your PalmPilot-style computer to view TV programs, where the palmtop asks
the main system to give it the TV display, the main system identifies there is a
TV tuner in the TV and asks it for the TV video/audio which it then displays on
the palmtop. Also, imagine coming back from holiday, and being able to tell your
central  heating  system  to fire up and be ready for your return in a couple of
hours,  via  your  palmtop or some other computer, talking via the internet, for
example.  Oh  yes, and the ultimate in laziness - being able to "remote control"
your TV from half way round the world <g>).

Several  big  companies  are working with Amiga, including Corel, Adobe, Sun and
Transmeta.

Linus is working on parts of the Amiga port.

The OS wil NOT be a Linux distribution. The user suystem will have a small Linux
kernel with all the other features of OE built on top.

The  developer  system, however, will ship with as a complete Linux distribution
with the OE on top of that (to give developer tools etc).

OS3.5 is delayed by a few weeks. IF it sells well, they will carry on developing
newer  and improved versions; if it does NOT sell well, then OS3.5 is the end of
the line for the Classi OS - it's up to us :)

H&P  *WILL*  be  porting WarpUp to run on the new P5 g3 cards!!!! (This was from
H&P themselves).

IBrowse  2  is  out? Erm, no. They were selling a pre-release beta, which Hisoft
pointed out contains several bugs, which will be fixed in a free upgrade at some
point.  (A friend bought IB2, and after 5 minutes of trying it out, gave up. The
Javascript   support   is,  well,  totally  crap!  IT  seems  to  complain  that
"onmouseover"  is  not a valid JS function, for example... We haven't found a JS
page  which  it  correctly  displays  yet, but maybe there is one out there?) So
basically, they have released a beta version to coincide with WoA.

Voyager  3  pre-release  demo was also out, although they were MUCH more upfront
about it only being a pre-release demo.

No sign of AWeb 3.3 release yet.

AWeb and Miami are part of the OS3.5 distribution (although in what form was not
clarified).

Annex have a new song out.

And  that's about it. Hope this makes sense (I only posted this 'cos there's not
been much else posted here as yet...)

Oh  yes. I nearly forgot. Claim to fame time - Ben and I have the distinction of
being thrown out of the press conference by Petro himself <g>

(We  walked into the press conference, thining it was the room for Dr Havemose's
technical  presentation.  By  the  time  we  realised, it was too late to make a
graceful exit, so we lurked in a corner unobtrusivly. After a couple of moments,
Petro  came  over  and  suggested  that  we  might  be looking for the Technical
presentation in the other room. So there we have it. Not many can claim to have
been  thrown  out by Petro <g> [he was very nice and polite about it, as always,
of course] ).

Have fun, off to see Star Wars again.

TTFN,
Keith
