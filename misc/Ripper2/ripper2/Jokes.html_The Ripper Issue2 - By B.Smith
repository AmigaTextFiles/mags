<p>
<p>
           Your eyelash! OK! It only sticks out around a quarter of

           Two tramps meet up in a country lane! the youngest says
<p>
           "!'m starving!" The elder tramp said " I'll show you how
<p>
           to get a free meal!"
<p>
           They walk a little way down the road until they come to
<p>
           a large mansion!
<p>
           The eldest tramp said "Watch this" and as he was walking
<p>
           to the door of the mansion, He picked up a lump of dried Horse DUNG
<p>
           He proceeded to knock on the mansion door, And when the
<p>
           Lady of the house answered, He held out the piece of
<p>
           Horse shit and said "PLEASE LADY COULD YOU SPARE A LITTLE
<p>
           SALT FOR MY LUNCH" The lady of the house looked horrified
<p>
           and said "MY DEAR MAN YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY EAT THAT,GO
<p>
           ROUND TO THE KITCHEN AND TELL THEM I SAID TO GIVE YOU a meal
<p>
           30 minutes later out came the tramp, and said to his
<p>
           new friend "THAT's HOW TO DO IT!"
<p>
           Further down the road they spotted another mansion! The
<p>
           Younger tramp said "MY TURN" and grabbed a piece of dried
<p>
           horse shit and ran to the door!
<p>
           When the Lady of the house answered he eagerly held out
<p>
           the shit and said"EXCUSE ME LADY BUT COULD I HAVE SOME
<p>
           SALT FOR MY LUNCH?" The lady looked horrified and said
<p>
<p>
           "MY DEAR MAN YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY EAT THAT! POP ROUND TO
<p>
           THE STABLES AND GET YOURSELF A FRESH BIT!"
