<H2>The Review Of Blizzard 603e/166:</H2>
<P>
<Font color=#4c4c4c>
 Blizzard 603e comes in a big box (2 times bigger than a Blizzard 1240/60
box).When you open the box, you can see Blizzard PPC in a anti-static cover, a
English/German User Manual, a 880KB PowerUP System Floppy and PPC CD-ROM V2
which includes PPC Utilities, PPC Tools and PPC Demos.
<P>
 Unlike Blizzard 1240s or 1260s, Blizzard PPC has components and chips on its
both faces.On one face Motorola PowerPC with a black cooler (which looks like a
Pentium II)  and Motorola 68K is mounted,on the other face there are two 72-pin
Simm slots also the BVision 3D graphics card slot.The concept and the hardware
design is really amazing.
<P>
 Blizzard PPC is upgradeable up to 128 MB Fast-RAM, fully autoconfigurating.And
2 Simms slots make memory upgrade easier.I`m using two 16 MB Edo-Simms which
gives me 32MB fast ram.If I need it,I`ll replace one of the 16 MBs with a 32MB
simm and I`ll have 48MB fast memory.There are no jumpers on Blizzard
PPC,everything is Plug And Play !.Also there`s a FlashRom on the board which
stores the PPC startup software (ppc.library V45.16 ,e.t.c) which can be updated
on demand by software.
<P>
 I`m using Blizzard PPC in my Micronik Infinity A1200T,but you can use Blizzard
PPC with a desktop Amiga 1200.If you will use Blizzard PPC in a desktop
A1200,you should leave the trap door open or cut a hole in plastic trap door and
put a heat sink/cooling fan there.There are no heating problems in tower A1200
like mine.
<P>
 Blizzard PPC boards doesn`t work with standart A1200/A600 PSUs. 4,5 Amps for 5
Volts is needed for A1200 with a Blizzard PPC,but standart A1200 PSU outputs
only 3 Amps for 5 Volts.Old A500+ PSUs outputs 4.5 Amps,so you can use one of
these.Of course best solution is buying a reinforced PSU (like Goliath,e.t.c) or
buying a Power Tower/Micronik Infinity with a strong PSU.
<P>
 Blizzard has 66 Mhz PowerPC bus.PPC cpu always uses this 66 Mhz bus.Also the
Bvision slot which the reaches the PPC cpu directly is perfectly suitable for
2D/3D acceleration in graphic operation.
<P>
 As I said before there`s a flash-rom installed on the board.So the Blizzard
603e/+ is ready for use after power up.A special version of the RTG system
Cybergraphics is supplied on PPC CD-ROM.Insert your PPC CD into your CD drive
and open PHASE5/CGX3 drawer.Here you`ll find a file called CGX41_70.lha .Unpack
the archive and install Cybergfx-PPC for AGA chipset.(P.S.:Visit
[http://www.vgr.com/cybergfx] Official Cybergraphics Web Site for updates.)
Cybergfx doesn`t speed up AGA chipset but it only emulates Cybergfx on AGA
hardware.With this emulation you can play mpegs with ISIS 2.9 PPC player in a
small window with dithered colors.
<P>
 By the way, I think that Blizzard Vision PPC is a must for any Blizzard PPC
owner.AGA is good for some purposes,but it`s too old and too slow.Blizzard
Vision has a modern 2D/3D chip called Permedia2 which is manufactured by
[http://www.3dlabs.com] 3D Labs.Permedia2 has all the features that you expect
from a 3D card.Blizzard PPC will show its real power when BVision is released by
Phase5.Phase5 will release BvisionPPC gfx card in June/July 1998.

<P>
 A Blizzard PPC plus a Bvision PPC combo is a perfect upgrade solution for
current A1200 owners who are stuck with AGA.With a PPC 603e/250 plus 68060/50
you can buy a very fast card or you can buy a powerful entry level PPC 603e/166
plus 68040/25 if you don`t have enough money.I`m sure that Blizzard PPC boards
will push the market forward until new Amigas like Pre/Box or Boxer 2 PPC are
released in 1999.
<P>
<P>
 I won`t give any ratings,because Blizzard PPC isn`t comparable to any other
accelerator board available in Amiga market.But I can say that it`s the best
hardware development since the release of Amiga 1200.
<P>
Final Words: Join The Amiga PPC Army !
