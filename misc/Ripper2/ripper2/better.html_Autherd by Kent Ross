   I look at you, then you me<BR>
   Hungry and thirsty are we<BR>
   Holding the lion's share<BR>
   Holding the key<BR>

   Better than you<BR>
   Better than you<BR>
   <BR>
   Lock horns, I push and I strive<BR>
   Somehow I feel more alive<BR>
   Bury the need for it<BR>
   Bury the seed<BR>
   Bury me deep when there's no will to be<BR>
   <BR>
   Better than you<BR>
   Better than you<BR>
