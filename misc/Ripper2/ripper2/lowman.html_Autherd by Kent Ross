                              <B>LOW MAN'S LYRIC</B><BR>
                             (Hetfield, Ulrich)<BR>
   <BR>
   One, two, three, one<BR>
<BR>
   Mm, mm, mm<BR>
   Mm, mm, mm<BR>
   Mm, mm, mm<BR>
<BR>
   My eyes seek reality<BR>
   My fingers seek my veins<BR>
   There's a dog at your back step<BR>
   He must come in from the rain<BR>
   I fall 'cause I've let go<BR>
   The net below has rot away<BR>
   So my eyes, seek reality<BR>
   And my fingers seek my veins<BR>
   <BR>
   The trash fire is warm<BR>
   But nowhere safe from the storm<BR>
   And I can't bear to see<BR>
   What I've let me be,<BR>
   So wicked and worn<BR>
   <BR>
   So as I write to you<BR>
   Of what is done and to do,<BR>
   Maybe you'll understand<BR>
   And won't cry for this man,<BR>
   'Cuse low man is due<BR>
   <BR>
   Please forgive me<BR>
   <BR>
   My eyes seek reality<BR>
   My fingers feel for faith<BR>
   Touch clean with a dirty hand<BR>
   I touch the clean to the waste<BR>
   <BR>
   The trash fire is warm<BR>
   But nowhere safe from the storm<BR>
   And I can't bear to see<BR>
   What I've let me be<BR>
   So wicked and worn<BR>
   <BR>
   So as I write to you, yeah<BR>
   Of what is done and to do, oh yeah,<BR>
   Maybe you'll understand<BR>
   And won't cry for this man<BR>
   'Cause low man is due<BR>
   <BR>
   Please forgive me, yeah<BR>
   Please forgive me<BR>
   Please forgive me<BR>
   <BR>
   So low, the sky is all I see<BR>
   All I want from you is forgive me<BR>
   So you bring this poor dog in from the rain,<BR>
   Though he just wants right back out again<BR>
   <BR>
   I cry to the alley way<BR>
   Confess all to the rain<BR>
   But I lie, lie straight to the mirror,<BR>
   The one I've broken to match my face<BR>
   <BR>
   The trash fire is warm<BR>
   But nowhere safe from the storm<BR>
   And I can't bear to see<BR>
   What I've let me be<BR>
   So wicked and worn<BR>
   <BR>
   So as I write to you<BR>
   Of what is done and to do, yeah<BR>
   Maybe you'll understand<BR>
   And won't cry for this man<BR>
   'Cause low man is due<BR>
<BR>
   Please forgive me<BR>
   Please forgive me<BR>
   <BR>
   So low, the sky is all I see<BR>
   All I want from you is forgive me<BR>
   So you bring this poor dog in from the rain<BR>
   Though he just wants right back out again<BR>
   <BR>
   My eyes seek reality<BR>
   My fingers seek my veins<BR>
   <BR>
   Mm, mm, mm, mm<BR>
   Mm, mm, mm, mm<BR>
   Mm, mm, mm, mm<BR>
