All in all not a bad CD. Very Badreligion-ish<BR>
(you'll see what I mean when you hear it, Or get off your butt and buy it!<BR>
<P>
(Did you know that there was a real world out there!??)<BR>
<P>
The band are very conscious of what goes on in the world,<BR>
Or at least what is wrong with it.<BR>
And the main message that you can walk away with is -<BR>
<P>
Think for yourself,<BR>
and make you own decisions.<BR>
Rather than sit blindly and let other people do it for you!<BR>.
<P>
This is an album to make you think, Or if you own a PC.<BR>
Then you are obviously incapable of doing that,<BR>
just stick it on and blast yourself into a def <BR>
and permanent thought incapable state (like your local politician.)...EH??<BR>
