<P>
The kids will love this funny adventure film. Perfect to keep them out of your hair <BR>
during the summer holidays. Laughs start from the beginning when George is<BR>
found and then (Rather predictably) brought to the big City. Where (predictably) he <BR>
ends up getting lost. (predictably) Romance blossoms in the form of "Thrsula"<BR>
(predictably) She has a boyfriend who (predictably) is a rather nasty guy.<BR>
So we dont like him.

So in short - We have all seen this kind of film before. its not the bad acting that
might spoil your enjoyment of this film. But just rather predictable plot lines!
<P>
But on a good note - It is all done very well, And Brendon is great at playing
George. Plus the laughs are constant
