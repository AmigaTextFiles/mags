<CENTER>The big news on the month! Andy Gorham Quits
International Football! Of course this is a
serious set-back to Scotlands World cup hopes
My personal view, Is that Andy should have
been played, Not as a Goalkeeper but as our
main striker! Well lets face it, According to
the press he has SCORED more often than all
the rest of them put together! </CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER>Of course if Gorham was in goals, When we did play Brazil,
His attention would have been on the scantily clad Samba girls that follow them!
So we were much better off with Leighton in goal, Well If he hasn't got his contacts
he can't see past the 6 yard box Anyway!</CENTER>
<P>
<P>

 <CENTER>So McCoist's out of the Scotland squad, And Gazza's out of the England squad!
 Congratulations to both Hoddle and Brown, At least now we both have the
 excuses we needed when we don't perform well in the World Cup!
 We can safely say Scotland WOULD have Beaten Brazil, But we missed
 McCoist's Goals, Or that England WOULD have WON the World Cup if they
 Had Gazza's Elbows. & Posh Spice insted of Beckam!(-ED)
      OH! Well there is always next time!</CENTER>
<P>
<P>


      <CENTER>OK! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON??????? <BR>
      As I sit and wrote this,We were 5 days from the opening games of<BR>
      THE WORLD CUP! And what are the Headlines in the NewsPapers?  <BR>
      GAZZA:- Crying on the shoulder of anyone who would listen, That<BR>
      It is so unfair that he is not in the England Squad, this despite<BR>
      The fact that he was spotted walking about a golf course,        <BR>
      Fag in hand, Swigging from a can of Lager, And rolling about the Green<BR>
      Like some demented Puppy that wanted its Belly scratched!</CENTER>

<P>
<P>

      <CENTER>If that is not bad enough! Now we have Pictures of Sheringham,<BR>
      Fag in hand, Having an all night BENDER and disappearing into the     <BR>
      BOGS with a Blonde Bimbo! OK! they say nothing happened, Tell         <BR>
      that to George Michael, Poor chap, He got arrested and fined for      <BR>
      Displaying what he thought of American cops, In the Toilets!          <BR>
      And to cap it all, We have Beckham Walking about in a BLOODY FROCK!<BR></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<H2><CENTER>**Lets Face it - It would of been alot safer with Posh Spice!</CENTER></H2>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER> Now it would be very easy for me to turn around and laugh about This,<BR>
      Or even GLOAT! I am Scottish! But the rest of the World don't           <BR>
      See England,Scotland,Ireland and Wales as separate Countries, To        <BR>
      Them we are all British! And the Antic's Of these Overpaid DOPES        <BR>
      Reflect upon us all! </CENTER>
<P>
<P>
      <CENTER>We used to have a reputation for a STIFF UPPER LIP !<BR>
      Now its a Stiff drink or worse A STIFF IN THE TOILETS!<BR>
       Its fast becoming EMBARRASSING to be BRITISH ! <BR>
<P>
      Still.....at least the tartin army saves Scotland.
<P>
      And England has......... </CENTER>
