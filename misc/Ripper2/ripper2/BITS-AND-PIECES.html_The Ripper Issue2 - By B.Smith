  This award must go to a Glasgow Chimney Sweep
<P>
  Called out by one of his regular customers,
  A Pensioner, To cleanHer Chimney.
<P>
 Having completed his task, He informed the Pensioner that
<P>
  He would have to charge her an extra 50p, This was due to the rising
<P>
  Cost of electricity!
<P>
           After he had left, One of the pensioner's friends pointed out
<P>
  that he actually used her Electricity when doing her chimney!

 CHEEK OF THE MONTH
<P>
<Font Color=#00FF75>
 This award must go to the 4 Men from Stirling
<P>
 Who climbed up a Flagpole, At Bannockburn Battlefield, And pinched
<P>
 the Scottish Saltire, Replacing it with an old Curtain on Which
<P>
 was Proudly painted "GONE TO FRANCE"
<P>
  The National Trust for Scotland, The true owners of the Flag, Have
<P>
 Promised no further action will take place, Provided the Flag is
<P>
 Returned to them, In good condition, AFTER the World Cup!
<P>
               <CENTER>WELL DONE THE NATIONAL TRUST!

  <CENTER>OH WELL! I see the MER Spacestation has made the news again! This is
<P>
  the last time that the Space Shuttle, Will dock with it. It seemS that
<P>
  both the British and Americans feel that the Station is outdated and
<P>
  obsolete, However the Russians are trying to maintain it as long as
<P>
  Possible.
<P>
  The main problem with MER, Appears to be the Computer system breaking
<P>
  down! Well by my reckoning, The station has been in service for just
<P>
  over 10 years, It took 2 years to construct, And possibly another
<P>
  2 years development on the ground, That makes the Technology of MER
<P>
  14 years old! So I can only presume that the computer's we are
<P>
  talking about are, Either Commodore 64 or the Spectrum ZX. I suppose
<P>
  We are all aware of the shortcomings of these machines, And I would
<P>
  Assume that the TAPEDECK HEADS are now out of line! So if anyone out
<P>
  there still has a working Tape deck for a C64, Why not get in touch
<P>
  With Moscow, And offer your services! </CENTER>

  Its so unfair! Still maybe next Year!
