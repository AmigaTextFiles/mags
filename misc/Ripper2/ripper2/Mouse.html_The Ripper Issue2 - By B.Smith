I was Given this black mouse by my mate. He had raved about it for WEEKS!!<Br>
On first apperences the black mouse looked just like EVERY other mouse.<Br>
except for the rather long cabel it comes with, And rather handy it is too.
<P>
The speed in which it reached me with was not that slow.- (unlike some places)
And the bloke on the phone sounded like he WANTED TO TAKE YOUR ORDER!!

When I pluged it in I could not controle the speed of the thing!
I THEN descoverd that the mouse had <font color =#FF0000><H2>560 D.P.I!</H2>
So the first thing that I did was to slow it down so that I could see the bloody thing.
I THEN found out that I could use the third button on my Directory Opus(5.66)
Not bad For £12.99 - you even get some AMIGA Pd to use the third button with!
