FILM NAME :The Jackal<BR>
Release date : 17/7<BR>
Staring : Bruce Willis & Richard Gere<BR>

<P>
PLOT:- Bruce Willis is "The Jakal" a terrorist who has never been seen,<BR>
Except by one man - Richard Gere - who is Enlisted to help hunt "The Jackal"<BR>
although Gere's rubbish Irish accent will dampen things at times,<BR>
This film has good performences and lots of action for all!!!!
