                           (Hetfield, Ulrich)<BR>
   <BR>
   There's a black cloud overhead, that's me<BR>
   And the poison ivy chokes the tree, again it's me<BR>
   I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street, you walk on by<BR>
   I'm the little boy that pushes hard and makes them cry<BR>
   <BR>
   There's a dirty needle in you child, haha, stick me<BR>
   Empty bottle still in hand, still dead, still me<BR>
   I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street and still wants more<BR>
   I'm the forty-five that's in your mouth<BR>
   I'm a dirty, dirty whore<BR>
   <BR>
   Yeah, look it's me<BR>
   The one who can't be free<BR>
   Much too young to focus, but too old to see<BR>
   Hey, look it's me<BR>
   What no one wants to see<BR>
   See what you've brought this world<BR>
   Just what you wanna see<BR>
   Hey ma, hey ma, look it's me<BR>
   <BR>
   Yeah, he wants to be called father now, me again, me<BR>
   The marks inside your arm spell me, spell only me<BR>
   I'm the nothing face that plants the bomb and strolls away<BR>
   I'm the one who doesn't look quite right as children play<BR>
   <BR>
   Yeah, look it's me<BR>
   The one who can't be free<BR>
   Much too young to focus, but too old to see<BR>
   Hey, look it's me<BR>
   What no one wants to see<BR>
   See what you brought this world<BR>
   Just what you wanna see<BR>
   Hey ma, hey ma, look it's me<BR>
   <BR>
   Look up to me<BR>
   What to be and what to fear<BR>
   Look up to me<BR>
   Look it's me, I'm what you hear<BR>
   See right through me<BR>
   See the one who can't be free<BR>
   See right through me<BR>
   Look it's me, what no one wants to see<BR>
   <BR>
   Hey, hey ,hey<BR>
   See the black cloud over head, that's me<BR>
   This poison ivy chokes the tree, again it's me<BR>
   And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street, you walk on by<BR>
   And I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes, makes them cry<BR>
