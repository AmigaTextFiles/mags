<b><center><h4>Please Note:  This product is temporarily out of production</h4></center>
Interworks is researching alternative PCMCIA technology to replace the
I-Card, however we do not expect to have anything available for production
for at least a couple of months.  Stay in touch with our web site for up to
date information.</b><br><br><hr>

The I-Card is the first professional Ethernet card for the Amiga 600 and
Amiga 1200.  This high-speed, 16-bit, SANA-II compliant Ethernet adapter
allows any Amiga with a PCMCIA port, to seamlessly integrate into larger
networks.  Network these systems together using professional networking
software such as ENLAN-DFS, together with powerful multimedia products like
InfoChannel and you have the perfect solution for kiosks, education, cable
tv and more.
