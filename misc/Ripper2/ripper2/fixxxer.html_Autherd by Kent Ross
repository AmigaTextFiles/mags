                                 <B>FIXXXER</B><BR>
                        (Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett)<BR>
   <BR>
   Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins<BR>
   One for each of us and our sins<BR>
   So you lay us in a line<BR>
   Push your pins, they make us stumble<BR>
   Only you can tell, in time<BR>
   If we fall or merely stumble<BR>
   <BR>
   But tell me, can you heal what father's done,<BR>
   Or fix this hole in a mother's son?<BR>
   Can you heal the broken worlds within,<BR>
   Can you strip away so we may start again?<BR>
   Tell me, can you heal what father's done<BR>
   Or cut this rope and let us run?<BR>
   Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free<BR>
   You jab another pin, jab another pin in me<BR>
   <BR>
   Mirror, mirror, upon the wall<BR>
   Break the spell or become the doll<BR>
   See you sharpening the pins<BR>
   So the holes will remind us<BR>
   We're just a toys in the hands of another<BR>
   And in time the needles turn from shine to rust<BR>
   <BR>
   But tell me, can you heal what father's done<BR>
   Or fix the hole in mother's son?<BR>
   Can you heal the broken worlds within<BR>
   Can you strip away so we may start again?<BR>
   Tell me, can you heal what father's done<BR>
   Or cut this rope and let us run?<BR>
   Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free<BR>
   You jab another pin<BR>
   Jab another pin in me<BR>
   Jab it<BR>
   <BR>
   Blood for face<BR>
   Sweat for dirt<BR>
   Three X's for the stone<BR>
   To break this curse<BR>
   A ritual's due<BR>
   I believe I'm not alone<BR>
   Shell of shotgun<BR>
   Pint of gin<BR>
   Ah, numb us up to shield the pins<BR>
   Renew our faith which-a way we can<BR>
   To fall in love with life again<BR>
   To fall in love with life again<BR>
   To fall in love with life again<BR>
   To fall in love<BR>
   To fall in love<BR>
   To fall in love with life again<BR>
   <BR>
   So tell me, can you heal what father's done<BR>
   Or fix the hole in mother's son?<BR>
   Can you heal the broken worlds within<BR>
   Can you strip away so we may start again?<BR>
   Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done<BR>
   Or cut this rope and let us run?<BR>
   Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free<BR>
   You jab another pin<BR>
   Jab another pin in me<BR>
   Oh yeah<BR>
   <BR>
   No more pins in me, yeah<BR>
   No more, no more pins in me<BR>
   No more, no more pins in me<BR>
   No more, no more, no more<BR>
   No, no, no<BR>
   <BR>
