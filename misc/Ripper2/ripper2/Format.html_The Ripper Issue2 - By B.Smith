<B>W</B>hen my friend (who we won't say my name) Dougie,<BR>
phoned up to subscribe to Amiga Format,<BR>
He was VERY suprised to be told that becouse, his card (Switch)<BR>
was from the Royal Bank of <U>SCOTLAND</U> <U>It would NOT BE ALLOWED!</U><BR>
The girl on the phone said that the reason for the problem,<BR>
was because of the lack of an <U>ISSUE NUMBER.</U><BR>
And the software would not take it.<CENTER>(Must not be an Amiga!)</CENTER>
<BR>
He just said that thay had just lost a customer! and she said "Its Not The First!!!!"<br>
Has any one else had this problem?<BR></Center>
