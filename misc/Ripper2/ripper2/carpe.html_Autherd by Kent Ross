                          <B>CARPE DIEM BABY</B><BR>
                     (Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett)<BR>
   <BR>
   Hit dirt, shake tree,<BR>
   Split sky, part sea<BR>
   <BR>
   Strip smile, lose cool<BR>
   Bleed the day and break the rule<BR>
   <BR>
   Live win, dare fail,<BR>
   Eat the dirt and bite the nail <BR>
   <BR>
   Then make me miss you,<BR>
   Then make me miss you<BR>
   <BR>
   So wash your face away with dirt<BR>
   It don't feel good until it hurts<BR>
   So take this world and shake it<BR>
   Come squeeze and suck the day<BR>
   Come carpe diem, baby<BR>
   <BR>
   Draw lead, piss wine,<BR>
   Sink teeth, all mine<BR>
   <BR>
   Stoke fire, break neck<BR>
   Suffer through this, cheat on death<BR>
   <BR>
   Hug the curve, lose the time,<BR>
   Tear the map and shoot the sign<BR>
   <BR>
   Then make me miss you,<BR>
   Oh yeah<BR>
   Then make me miss you<BR>
   <BR>
   So wash your face away with dirt<BR>
   It don't feel good until it hurts<BR>
   So take this world and shake it<BR>
   Come squeeze and suck the day<BR>
   Come carpe diem, baby<BR>
   <BR>
   Live win, dare fail<BR>
   Eat dirt bite the nail<BR>
   <BR>
   Strip smile, lose cool<BR>
   Bleed the day and break the rule<BR>
   <BR>
   Hug the curve, lose the time<BR>
   Tear the map and shoot the sign<BR>
   <BR>
   Then make me miss you<BR>
   Come on, come on<BR>
   Then make me miss you<BR>
   <BR>
   So wash your face away with dirt<BR>
   It don't feel good until it hurts<BR>
   So take this world and shake it<BR>
   Come squeeze and suck the day<BR>
   Come make me miss you<BR>
   Come carpe diem, baby<BR>
   Come carpe diem, baby<BR>
