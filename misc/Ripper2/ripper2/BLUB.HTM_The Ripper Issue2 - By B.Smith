The Best thing that I like about this game is, how smooth the game play is!
You can game can be controled by Keys, Joystick, Joypad, Mouse (no not all at once!)
As usual If some one out there has the game then <B><U>please send us a review!</U></B>

Basicaly I could tell that the game is going to be a well worth buy. And a most exellent effort by VULCAN.
And I hope that this is just a good sign of the things to come and that it is not long b4 the Amiga is back on the
shelf where it belongs!<br>
