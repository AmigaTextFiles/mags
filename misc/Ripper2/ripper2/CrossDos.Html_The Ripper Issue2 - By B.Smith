REVIEW
<P>
<Font Color=#4c4c4c>
Crossdos has been provided in a limited form since Workbench 2.1, that version
allowed Amiga users to read/write MS-DOS disks via the PC0, PC1 etc. DosDrivers. It also
provided the CrossDos commodity program which allows you to filter out extra characters from
text files copied from MS-DOS disks and some Text Translation.
<P>
Since then Microsoft has released Windows 95 which extended the MS-DOS
filenames from the 8.3 (11 character) format to 256 character filenames.
The Amiga can read upto 30 character filenames. CrossDos 7 now allows you
to read/write 30 character filenames onto MS-DOS disks (longer filenames
are not recommended as some programs may not work correctly). Volume
names are still limited to 11 characters long.
<P>
       I had the Workbench version of CrossDos since I bought my Amiga 1200 and
     used it often when copying files to/from work especially from Aminet or
     converting Word files into RTF or Wordperfect format for use on WordWorth
     at home. The short fileformat wasn't much of a problem but now that long
     filenames are pretty common, it was getting to be a pain having to use
     them.
<P>
       Consultron had only recently updated their web page and CrossDos 7 was
     advertised with Windows 95 filename support and at only $40 was a bargain!
     I immediately, posted a letter with my Mastercard details for it.
<P>
     A coupe of weeks later it arrived in the post. Crossdos was supplied on a
     floppy disk with a nice blue/gold manual (46 pages). I made a copy of the
     disk for backup purposes and installed the software via the Install program
     onto the Workbench partition of my hard disk.
<P>
     The software includes four DosDrivers (PC0-PC4), a CrossDos commodity
     program a QuickPrep program, a DiskChg program and new versions of Format,
     Diskcopy and Mount programs (v40) and the CrossDosFileSystem.
<P>
       The new drivers have been working faultlessly since day one although
     MCP caused read errors with the Trackdisk option enabled (it is now
     disabled). I saved some files with Windows 95 onto a floppy disk and took
     it home and lo and behold the disk displayed the filenames at full length.
     It also works with the normal 8.3 files as well.
<P>
       According to the manual, you should keep Windows 95 filenames under 30
     characters long as that is the limit for Amiga OS. I have never used
     really long filenames so that really isn't an issue but will be if saving
     from a Win 95 machine.
<P>
       I am now using it as normal and I don't have to remember to reduce it
     down to the awful 8.3 format anymore. Windows 3.x machines will probably
     just see the truncated file format. Well worth the money.

DOCUMENTATION
<P>
<Font Color=#4c4c4c>
     The manual comes with CrossDos is 46 pages long and comes in a nice blue
     /gold cover. There are still references to long gone products such as
     Wordperfect, Final Copy, ADPro etc but includes new products such
     as Syjet, Zip, Jaz etc.
        There is an example mountlist on p26 but didn't come out quite right
     with some characters overlapping others. I hope Consultron can fix this.
        There is a useful 8 page trouble shooting guide for problems with
     CrossDos.

BUGS
<P>
<Font Color=#4c4c4c>
     No bugs have been found as yet. The latest update is available to
     upgrade to 7.02 on their web page.

GOOD POINTS
<P>
<Font Color=#4c4c4c>
     Easy to install and completely transparent to the user. Plenty of
     useful utilities to go with it. The ConfigDisk will be useful for
     other removable drives as Mountlists can be automatically created.
     QuickPrep is useful to format MS-DOS partitions.
<P>

<Font Color=#FF0000>DISLIKES
<P>
<Font Color=#4c4c4c>
     I would have like to seen a DiskSalv type utility to fix Read/Write
     errors. MS DOS 6 has Scandisk, although Norton Utilities on the PC
     is excellent on finding a fixing common disk problems and mapping out
     bad blocks.
       The disk uses horrible standard four colour icons which are awful.
     A combination of MWB or NewIcons would have been nice for a 90s
     product.
<P>

CONCLUSIONS
<Font Color=#4c4c4c>
<P>
     Worthwhile having if you use PCs and Amigas to transfer files on a
     regular basis esp. if you have access to Win 5 machines otherwise
     the normal CrossDos on WB would suffice for the rest of us.
<P>
