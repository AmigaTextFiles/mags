<P>
Fantastic Film well worth watching, Becouse of a great performance from Al Pacino.<BR>
Keanu plays a young, up and coming lawer in a small contry town, with a perfict<BR>
record. He attracts the attention of a top law firm in the big city. While he ih there<BR>
he knotices that things are not good as thay seem. Nither is his boss Al Pacino.<BR>
<P>
<Font Color=#FFFFFF>
 IN SHORT - Good Story, Well directed with lots of twists in  the story.<BR>
but its Al Pacino that steels the show.<BR>
<P>

VERDICT :- 8/10
