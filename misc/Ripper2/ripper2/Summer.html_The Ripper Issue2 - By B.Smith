From the makers of Scream (1+2) comes "I know what you did last summer"<BR>
A "rather not as good" teen thriller. this film lacks all the humour,<BR>
and suspense that made Scream (1+2) a joy to watch.<BR>
However, it is still worth seeing. with good performances from the main cast.<BR>
In their first major film.<BR>
<P>
THE PLOT- 4 Friends are our driving, when they hit someone!<BR>
rather than admit to this, they leave him for dead.<BR>

IN SHORT - Entertaining to watch but not in the same league as  Scream (1+2)<BR>

VERDICT :- 6/10
