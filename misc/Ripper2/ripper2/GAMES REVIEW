  ONESCAPEE.
  ++++++++++ Well if you enjoyed Flashback, You will love this game!
  
  Unfortunately for some of you, It comes on CD only! But to be fair

  If you do not have a CD, Then this is the perfect excuse to upgrade!

  The game comes with a stunning Intro, Which is really worth watching

  However too often games have a great Intro, but after that the game

  stinks! Not so with OnEscapee! the Graphics are stunning and the

  game play, Excellent. Some of the puzzles you have to solve to get

  past parts of the game are quite difficult, But not so hard that you lose

  interest. On the whole an Excellent game that should be in everyone's

  collection.

  If I have one complaint to make! It is that, although the graphics are

  excellent! there is one part, Where a PURPLE dragon thing pops out and

  eats you? Why the HELL they decided to make it purple beats me! And as

  all the Graphic's prior to this, Were almost believable! The purple

  dragon was a bit of a disappointment! However don't let this put you off

  and get this game as quick as you can.

**********************  Yes the long awaited game has arrived at last!

I am a fan of CM 93 and looked forward to this being released !And I can

truely say! If you don't have this in your collection YOUR LUCKY !

I have never in my life been so disappointed with a game! It appears that

they didn't really want to release this to the Amiga, But eventually bowed

to pressure! However to ensure that they would never have to produce

another Amiga game, They decided to COCK THIS ONE UP ! And they succeeded

It is RUBBISH and so slow that it is virtually unplayable, And of course

people with Amiga's don't have Harddrives!! So they don't make it HD

Installable.

To be avoided at all costs!
