<U><CENTER><H1><U>IS THE AMIGA REALY DEAD???</U></H1></CENTER>
                        
<P>

<CENTER>WELL HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU READ OR HEARD THIS DEBATE?</CENTER>
<CENTER>PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS!</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>SO! LET ME MAKE THIS VERY PLAIN, THE AMIGA IS A FANTASTIC LITTLE COMPUTER!</CENTER><Br>
<CENTER>BUT IT IS JUST THAT! A COMPUTER,</CENTER><Br>
<P>
<CENTER>IT DOES NOT DIE, </CENTER>
<CENTER>IT MAY BREAK DOWN,BLOW UP</CENTER>
<CENTER>OR MELT,</CENTER>
<CENTER>BUT IT CAN'T DIE.</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>I could take my trusty 1200, right now and wrap it in a clean linen sheet,
seal it in a wooden box and stick it in the loft! and then in a 100 years
someone could stumble across it, open it up, plug in the power supply and
it would probably work! see it didn't die! now if you gave me the same
treatment and in a hundred years stuck 240 volts up my backside! i'm bloody
sure that you wouldn't get a lot of response!</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>So! its the people that use machines that die or move on, not the machines
themselves, the problem with the amiga is not death! but progress!<br>
and sadly since the demise of commodore (Thank God!?)<BR>
the amiga has progressed as far as one cyclist on a tandam,
towing a caravan up a steep hill.<BR>
now a lot of good stuff was said when gateway took over the amiga,</CENTER><BR>

<P>

<CENTER><H1>But</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>The user (you and I) have yet to see anything really constructive come out of it!<Br>
Sure we are getting the power pc chip(?!) and new machines can be bought<BR></CENTER>
<P>
<Font color =#FF0000>
<CENTER>but only on mail order!   </CENTER>
<CENTER>now that is great for me and you, </CENTER>
<CENTER>If my 1200 suddenly farts and flies out the window!</center>
<Center>I know where to get another, </CENTER>
<P>
<Font color=#008c8c>
<CENTER>But other people! people who want to buy their first computer,<BR>
how can they find out about our machine? only by buying an amiga magazine,<BR>
have you ever seen the amiga advertised anywhere else?<BR>
even the latest magazine "computer active" don't cover the amiga,<BR>
mobile phones,playstations and mac's yes! but not the amiga.why not?<BR></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>Is the amiga not a computer?</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>Why do we not all club together and write nasty letters
to these magazines and let our voice be heard!</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>It is only by our actions that we can prevent the amiga from fading away,<BR>
So get scribbling now! perhaps the most worrying trend at the moment,<BR>
And one often ignored by us, Is the 2 magazines that we have left </CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><H1><B>CU Amiga magazine and the Amiga Format</B></H1></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>Have you looked at their abcs lately? sales are falling!<BR>
now what happens if the publishers decide to call a halt to these magazines? <BR>
all the firms that support the amiga will have nowhere to advertise.<BR>
Its all very well getting quake,doom,and even myst on to the amiga,<BR></CENTER>
<P>
<Center>But if the magazines fold so does the amiga!<BR>
I have read one letter in the mags, where the reader complained that<BR>
the cover cds contain the same old stuff and that both mags have similar software,<BR>
and he couldn't see the point of buying both mags the point is simple! </CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><U><H2>If we don't buy the magazines, mailorder firms can't advertise,</H2></U></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>l then leave the amiga and we will all have to transfer to pcs,<BR>
well that is if you can afford one. If you want to help the amiga you can!<BR>
and it is very simple:-<BR></CENTER>
<P>
<Font Color=#FF0000>
<CENTER>Buy the magazines, </CENTER>
<CENTER>let the companies know that there is still an active market </CENTER>
<CENTER>and they will continue to produce products for the machine,</CENTER>

 <CENTER><U><H1><U>THE FATE IS IN YOUR HANDS...... </U></H2></U></CENTER>
