Yes it seems like a tradition that who ever is trying to make a go of the Amiga,<br>
Must shout and rant and rave, THEN dump us like a load of rubbish. Not that I am
suggesting that our new found "saviours" are just using us! <U>(not yet!)</U><BR>
But lets not stick our heads in the sand. How many times have we heard that failure cries of:-<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><H2>"We will put the Amiga back on top"</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><H1>OR</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><H2>"this time the Amiga will be on the shelves where it belongs"</H2></CENTER>
<P>
We have lost too much ground. We were the ones who cornered the market, Now we don't even have a 0.1% share.<BR>
our technology is too far behind the times.<BR>
<P>
It is my opinion that we MIGHT me able to get in at the Apple macs part of the market.<BR>
The PC (spit) is the one we have got to beat. And I can t see us being able to do that.<BR>
We would need to have graphic Card quality on the mother board as standard but at lowcost!<BR>
<P>
The other thing that I have heard people moaning about is the next operating system.<BR>
In my opinion, it should be Something like Directory Opus Magellan.<BR>
Or a better version (if that's at all possible) With strong emphasis on internet support.<BR>
Some guys from my local club, have voiced their fears that the next O.S will new be an Amiga,<BR>

<li>-Do anything that you ask it to do and more.
<LI>-Run with the minimum of fuss, with Maximum efficiency.
<LI>-Be easy to operate by any one,  Of any age and ability.
<LI>-But most importantly, BE CHEAP to buy, And expand. (like PCs are)

<U><B>Why are people turning their back on the Amiga???</B></U>

<H1>HARDWARE!!</H1>
<P>

Have you ever tried to buy some hardware recently?? The prices are sky high when you start to compare them<BR>
to that of the Pc places. We all just have to write to the places that are charging too much,<BR>
And tell them that the prices are unfair! - face the facts, not that that will make much if any difference.<BR>
But face the facts.....<H2>we can't do much else!!</H2><BR>
<P>
<font Color=#FF0000>
<B><U>DON'T PIRATE SOFTWARE!</U></B>
<P>
<font Color=#FFFFFF>
<OL>
<LI>You don't know what it might do! e.g. There is a copy of Directory Opus that FORMATS YOUR HARD DRIVE!!!
<P>
<LI>If you/we copy software then the author will just stop writing. And the Amiga will die for good!
<P>
<LI>Excuses like "Oh Just one copy wont hurt!" are full of crap! (see 2)
<P>
<LI>And Lastly Keep buying the mags (Both) becouse they are the only thing that keep us going!<BR>
