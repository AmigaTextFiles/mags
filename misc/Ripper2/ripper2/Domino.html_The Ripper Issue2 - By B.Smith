HI! THERE, I SUPPOSE YOU THINK IT IS FUNNY A DALMATION DOG WRITING AN
<P>
ARTICLE FOR A DISK MAGAZINE? HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL WHEN I SEE YOU
<P>
SUCKING A CHICKEN BONE? ITS THE SAME THING YOU KNOW!
<P>
RIGHT THIS MONTH I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY FAVORITE TV PORGRAM.
<P>
ITS CALLED TREKKIE! AND I WATCH IT EVERY NIGHT AT 5 O,CLOCK ON SKY!
<P>
NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVER WATCH THIS, BUT YOU SHOULD! ITS GOOD, BUT
<P>
LET ME TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THE MAIN PEOPLE IN IT.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<Font color=#0000FF>
HE IS THE LEADER OF THE PACK! ITS FUNNY THAT AS
<P>
HE HAS THE SAME NAME AS THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR WHO THROWS BISCUITS OVER
<P>
THE FENCE FOR ME, BUT HE LOOKS NOTHING LIKE HER! HE HAS A BIG BALD
<P>
HEAD AN A MAGIC FINGER! NOW I KNOW THAT IT IS A MAGIC FINGER AS ALL HE HAS
<P>
DO IS HOLD IT UP IN THE AIR, SHOUT " ENGAGE " AND HIS BIG SHIP DISAPPEARS
<P>
I REMEMBER ANOTHER MAGIC CHAP WHO USED TO BE ON THE TELLY AND HE COULD
<P>
MAKE THINGS DISAPPEAR, I THINK HIS NAME WAS PAUL DANGLEBALLS OR SOMETHING
<P>
LIKE THAT, ITS FUNNY HE WAS BALD AS WELL, I THINK MY MASTER WILL BE A
<P>
MAGIC MAN PRETTY SOON AS HIS HAIR IS FALLING OUT! OH! WELL ON WITH MY TALE
<P>
<P>
<P>

<H2>WILLIE RIKER</H2>

<Font color=#0000FF>
HE'S PICKHARDS NUMBER ONE??? I HAVE TO GO ON TO A BIT OF
<P>
WASTE GROUND FOR MY NUMBER ONES AND TWOS? SO HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANY
<P>
NUMBER ONE TO ME! HE IS A BIG BEARDY BLOKE AND FANCIES HIMSELF AS A BIT
<P>
OF A LADY'S MAN, HE'S QUITE TALL AS WELL,
SO I SUPPOSE HE IS A BIG WILLIE AND THAT MUST HELP.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<Font color=#0000FF>

<P>
HE IS ALWAYS GROWLING AT THE REST OF THE CREW, I THINK HE MUST BE ONE
<P>

<P>
THAT UPSET MY MASTER BY GIVING THEM WHEELIE BINS! THEY ARE BIG HUGE
<P>
THINGS THAT MEAN YOU CAN'T GET TO BURST THE BLACK BAGS AND GET TASTEY
<P>
LITTLE SNACKS. ANYWAY ALL SHE DOES IN THE PROGRAM IS CRY SO SHE IS A
<P>
WASTE OF SPACE

NOW DATA IS A PUTER, A BIT LIKE MY MASTERS AMIGA BUT NOT QUITE
<P>
AS GOOD, WELL I DON'T SEE HIM PLAYING MANY GAMES AND HE DOESN'T EVEN
<P>
HAVE A CD-ROM, BUT HE DOES WALK ABOUT QUITE A BIT AND TRIES TO BE
<P>
CLEVER, HE'S PROBABLY GOT ONE OF THEM PENTIUM THINGS, ALL POWER AND
<P>
NO PUFF! I'LL STICK WITH THE AMIGA.

NOW THIS IS A BLOODY SHAME! SOMEONE HAS TAKEN HIM FOR A WALK
<P>
AND PULLED SO HARD ON HIS LEAD, THAT HIS COLLAR HAS GONE RIGHT OVER
<P>
HIS EYES!  AND THEY LEAVE HIM LIKE THAT! IT HAPPENED TO ME ONCE, AND
<P>
I CAN TELL YOU ITS NOT VERY COMFIE! BUT AT LEAST MY MASTER SORTED IT
<P>
OUT, NOT HIS PALS, THEY JUST IGNORE IT AND LEAVE HIM WALKING ABOUT
<P>
HALF BLIND!
<P>
<P>
<Font color =#00FFFF>
WELL THAT IS A BIT OF INFORMATION ON THE CREW OF THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE
<P>
ITS REALLY A GREAT PROGRAM, YOU SHOULD WATCH IT SOME TIME, AND PLEASE
<P>
ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT DOG IS GOD SPELT BACKWARDS, PEOPLE IS ELPOEP! SO
<P>
I MUST BE A SUPERIOR BREED.
