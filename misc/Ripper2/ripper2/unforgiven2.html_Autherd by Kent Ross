                           <B>THE UNFORGIVEN II</B><BR>
                       (Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett)<BR>
   <BR>
   Lay beside me, tell me what they've done<BR>
   And speak the words I want to hear, to make my demons run<BR>
   The door is locked now, but it's opened if you're true<BR>
   If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you<BR>
   <BR>
   Lay beside me, under wicked sky<BR>
   Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze<BR>
   The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through<BR>
   Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through<BR>
   No, there's no sun shining through<BR>
   No, there's no sun shining<BR>
   <BR>
   What I've felt, what I've known<BR>
   Turn the pages, turn the stone<BR>
   Behind the door, should I open it for you<BR>
   <BR>
   Yeah<BR>
   What I've felt, what I've known<BR>
   Sick and tired, I stand alone<BR>
   Could you be there? 'cause I'm the one who waits for you<BR>
   Or are you unforgiven too?<BR>
   <BR>
   Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear<BR>
   She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again<BR>
   She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone<BR>
   Black heart scarring darker still, yes, she'll be there when I'm gone<BR>
   Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone<BR>
   Dead sure she'll be there<BR>
   <BR>
   What I've felt, what I've known<BR>
   Turn the pages, turn the stone<BR>
   Behind the door, should I open it for you<BR>
   <BR>
   What I've felt, what I've known<BR>
   Sick and tired, I stand alone<BR>
   Could you be there? 'cause I'm the one who waits for you<BR>
   Or are you unforgiven too?<BR>
   <BR>
   Lay beside me, tell me what I've done<BR>
   The door is closed, so are your eyes<BR>
   But now I see the sun, now I see the sun<BR>
   Yes, now I see it<BR>
   <BR>
   What I've felt, what I've known<BR>
   Turn the pages, turn the stone<BR>
   Behind the door, should I open it for you?<BR>
   <BR>
   Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known<BR>
   So sick and tired, I stand alone<BR>
   Could you be there? 'cause I'm the one who waits<BR>
   The one who waits for you<BR>
   <BR>
   Oh, what I've felt, what I've known<BR>
   Turn the pages, turn the stone<BR>
   Behind the door, should I open it for you<BR>
   So I dub thee unforgiven<BR>
   <BR>
   Oh, what I've felt<BR>
   Oh, what I've known<BR>
   <BR>
   I take this key<BR>
   And I bury it in you<BR>
   (You labeled me, I'll label you)   <BR>
   Because you're unforgiven too<BR>
   <BR>
   (Never be, never me)<BR>
   'Cause you're unforgiven too<BR>
