<H1>Space Station Managment Sim</H!>
</CENTER> <HR> <p><FONT SIZE="4">

News has reached me of a new game that is being developed.  It is still in a
very early stage, so early that at the moment only ideas for the game are being
bashed around.  Below is the initial game outline from the author:-<P>
<CENTER>
<B>New game - Press Release by Chris Korhonen</B><P>
</CENTER>
I am planning to start producing a Space Station Management
Simulation, here is a brief list of what I hope to include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>
First of alll you would select your race, and status:<P>
</LI>
<UL>
<LI>
-Military Status : Works for military, little freedom but you get lots
of supplies/crew/fighters supplied to you. You also get defensive
support.<P>
</LI>
<LI>
-Corperate Status : Employee of large corperation, bit more freedom
than military, attracts pirates, start with lots of £££. Well supplied
but weak ships/defenses.<P>
</LI>
<LI>
-Freelance : Start with large ship and limited capital, total freedom,
no defense, nothing supplied to you.<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
You would start by selecting a star system. Earth, etc. has a
lot of competion so it would be harder. An isolated system/unxplored
has little competition.  You can either use a large ship as a basis
for your station, or have one specially built. A purpose built one is
expensive, but flexably, whereas a ship is limited.. You decide its
location and which planet... You have a limited amount of funds and
you have to make the space station a sucess...</LI><P>

<LI>
You can help design the station or you can choose between several
basic structures depending on your race. After 6 months the space
staion/ground base is completed and you begin.....
Decide a name for your station. You would have options to rent out
areas to shops, businesses etc.
</LI><P>

<LI>
You have control over docking fees and room prices. Once you declare
the station operational the fun begins.......
</LI><P>
<LI>
You will be able to :
</LI><P>
<UL>
<LI>- Check on the competiton, ie. fees, facilities etc.</LI><P>
<LI>- Declare independance from governent/ Defect to opposing side</LI><P>
<LI>- Sell advertising space on the interior, exterior and on your
fighters!</LI><P>
<LI>- Get involved with illegal trading, ie. purchase small
station on the rim and use it as a front for illeagal doings......</LI><P>
<LI>- Own many stations</LI><P>
<LI>- Expand space and ground based staions</LI><P>
<LI>- Arm station and build a fleet to defend the station</LI><P>
<LI>- Meet with alien ambassadors (and blow them up)</LI><P>
<LI>- Sabotage other stations, by blockadeing, bombing or   sabotageing
facilities/docking bays</LI><P>
<LI>- manage air traffic</LI><P>
<LI>- be affected by wars, pirates, blockades, attacks...</LI><P>
</UL>
</UL>
Any suggestions are welcome.
