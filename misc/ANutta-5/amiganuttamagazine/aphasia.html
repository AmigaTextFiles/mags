Aphasia is a new shoot-em-up coming our way.  The game is still very early in
development and is set set to be released until the beginning of 1998 at the
earliest.<P>

Details on the game are quite low at them moment, however, I do have some of the
features that the game boasts.  It will probably contain six levels which will

be a mix of both vertical and horizontal scrolling.  A nice feature that the
game will contain is the ship being able to transform into a mech, it will also
change aspect depending on what weapons are being used.<P>

The game will also have some special light and water effects, which should help
to at least make it look good.  3 different languages and in-game speech will
also be in there.<P>

Like I said the game is not due for quite a while and the screenshots on this
page are very WIP.  Hopefully there will be a demo available sometime around
Christmas time.<P>
