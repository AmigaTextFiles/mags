<FONT SIZE="6">N</FONT>ew screenshots of the excellent looking Command & Conquer
clone Diversia have been released and are available on this page for viewing.
Diversia is Ablaze's second Amiga game, Strangers there first game was released
a couple of weeks ago by Vulcan Software. The screenshots on this page are taken
from two different modes, Low-Res and Hi-Res, I'm sure you can tell between the
two, the Hi-Res ones look brilliant.<P>

As I have told you before, the game features 256 colour graphics and is
viewable in a number of different screenmodes.  It will also be supporting
Network play allowing players the fight eachother over the Internet.<P>

As I sure you can see the graphics in this game are quite excellent, they are
extremally detailed colourful.  One part of them I particually like is the
explosions, they look brilliant.<P>

As for requirments, the game need at least an 030 with 4Mb Fast RAM.  It will
also require at least a 4x speed CD-ROM drive.  The game will hopefully support
PowerPC processors and already supports GFX boards.<P>

The game is currently over 50% complete and there will be a demo for people to
try out very soon.  For now take a look at these excellent screenshots.<P>
