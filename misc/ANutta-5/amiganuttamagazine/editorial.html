Hello,<P>

Welcome to the fifth issue of the Amiga Nutta games magazine.<P>

The webpage has been suffering a little of late due to lack of time to work on
it, as a consequence of this, there is a lack of news this issue.  Other parts
of the magazine have also suffered.  Hopefully, I will have much more time in
the future to work on both the webpage & the magazine.<P>

I feel that a word on the amiga games scene is in order this week.  Is it really
in such a good state that some people would like to believe?  Okay, we have some
excellent looking games lined up, some of which look like they could be the best
the Amiga has had.  However, if I said that it was in what is considered a good
state, I would be lying, because it is far from this.  Game sales are at the
lowest ever, with companies only expecting 3-5k sales from the top games set for
release.  Also the amount of (quality) games being released is very low, there
is a lot planned but very few have seen the light of day yet.<P>

This makes it more important then ever for us, the users to buy the games.  We
need to try and keep the people developing games at the moment with the
Amiga, the only way this can be done is buy actually buying the games, don't
just get a copy of your mate and think it's Ok other people will buy it.  This
may have been true a few years ago, but now, those other people are not there to
buy it. Hopefully the fact that the upcoming releases will be on CD will prevent
this and maybe, just maybe the morons who pirate the games (You know who you
are) may actually buy them.  So many companies have left the Amiga and luckily
there have been others to take there place, however, I'm not too certain if
there will be others to take the place of the current groups if they leave.<P>

Teams/People like Ablaze, World Foundry, Paul Burkey, Clickboom and many
others have all either released or have plans to release some very exciting
games, after these games are released we don't wan't them moving on to the PC
world. We need to keep them developing for the Amiga and producing better and
better games as they go.<P>

With PPC now here, hopefully the Amiga can build itself into something like what
is used to be (If it can ever reach them heights again, I dunno).  However, if
this is to be the case we all have to put our bit in.<P>

I'm sorry if this sounds a little depressive but there is no point in trying to
imply that that the Amiga is in a great position, 'cause it ain't!!  I'm sure
that the people reading realise this.<P>

Anyway, until the next issue....<P>
