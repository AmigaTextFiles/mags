Welcome to the inaugural issue of CD남View!  

You're probably asking yourself, "Why an electronic magazine for the CD남?"
Videogamers don't have computers, do they?  

Well, I'll tell you why.  I decided to start CD남View for two reasons.

One being the fact that the CD남 add-ons will open the world of the
CD남쟴o Amiga owners.  To keep them informed of what's going on,
CD남View was born.

The other reason is the amount of misinformation on the CD남쟴hat was, and
still is, being circulated on the electronic networks that criss cross
the world.  In particular, I am referring to FIDONet, since that's the
most accessable network to me.

A lot of proponents of the new videogame systems are bashing each other
over the head with a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo that truly means little
to the type of consumer that the CD남쟧s going to be aimed at.

This newsletter will look at the CD남 in a totally objective manner.
We will not hesitate to call a bad game a bad game or a bad product a
bad product.  Supposedly, CD남 proponents are notorious for saying that
the CD남쟧s superior to everything, no matter what the truth may be.
That won't happen here.

The CD남 game system truly is a spectacular piece of equipment.  A 32-bit
gaming system with a CD-ROM drive and an optional full-motion video module
for what some other systems with half the capability cost.  That's a 
given.  What's not is the software.  The software is what I want to 
concentrate on most.
 
To truly succeed, the CD남 needs quality software.  To get support for
quality software, it has to sell in large numbers.  If anything and
everything sells, then anything and everything (read: SHOVELWARE) 
will be released.  Our aim is to give you an idea of what to buy and
what to steer clear of.

There are some real stinkers out there and there are some true classics
(already!) available for the CD남.  The problem is finding out what is
what.  That's where we come in.

We're looking for those who share this same feeling and who want to 
write for us.  You can contact me via FIDONet netmail at 1:2601/512.
I'm also available via the Internet (see below for address) and I 
occasionally frequent Compuserve, and can be reached there.  In return,
I'll pass along the details on how you can contribute to the magazine as
a writer.  You can also pass any interesting news tidbits to us at those
same addresses.

We also welcome your comments, either positive or negative.  If we make
a mistake, point that out too.  We're not perfect and we'll gladly accept
corrections.

I look forward to seeing this magazine spread as far as possible, so I'm
also looking for contacts on the various commercial services as well as
the FTP sites.  

Thanks and see you next issue!

@NODE GAME1 "Labyrinth of Time Review"

Electronic Arts has thrown it's hat into the CD남 arena with it's first
Amiga CD-ROM game.  Although the game will work with the CD남, it is not
a CD남쟳pecific release.  It will also work on the Commodore CDTV as well
as any Amiga with a CD-ROM drive and at least 1 megabyte of chip memory.

As a result of this cross platform compatibility, the game does not use
the CD남's AGA chipset.  However, this does not stop it from being the 
best looking CD남 game on the market right now.

How is that possible?  LABYRINTH OF TIME uses interlaced HAM mode to 
display fully rendered 3D objects.  HAM is capable of displaying pictures
in 4,096 colors at the same time.  HAM is available on ALL Amiga models.
(It's also known as HAM6 now that the AGA machines such as the Amiga 1200
and Amiga 4000 have what is known as HAM8, which can display 262,000 
simultaneous colors.)

The object of the game is to manuever your way through the Labyrinth to
break the evil grip of a wizard over the Earth and the world of the 
mortals...or something like that.  Along the way, you will have to 
piece together puzzles and navigate through a dreamlike world full of
all sorts of interesting things: like an old movie theatre, a mirror maze,
and an old hotel.  Everything looks fantastic.

Your movements are controlled via a panel at the bottom of the screen.
It features arrows to control your direction, a hand icon to pick things
up and use them, a look icon to examine objects more closely and an
inventory list (with an automatic mapper so you can't get lost too
easily.)

All that aside, the gameplay is slow.  Moving from one scene to the next 
is time consuming as each screen needs to be read from the CD and then
displayed.  There is also no way to turn completely around in one move,
one must turn twice to the right or left to reverse direction.  Also, 
the CD남's controller moves the pointer very slowly.  Plugging an Amiga
mouse into the second port provides much speedier control.

Some of the objects are out of perspective from one scene to the next,
which can possibly cause confusion.  It's possible to think something was
hidden behind another object and is suddenly visible because you moved.
When in fact, it's the same object drawn out of perspective.  This leads
to unnecessary confusion for the player who is given enough to explore 
without looking at the same item and wondering if it's new or not.

The music that accompanies the game is wonderfully atmospheric, but 
don't expect it to give you clues or encouragement that you're going
in the right direction.  It's the best sounding music on any Amiga game
ever.  It just doesn't seem appropriate sometimes.  

Overall, the game is wonderful to look at and listen to, but not as fun
to play.  I desperately wanted to say that this is THE CD남 game to get
right now, but it's not.  It's too slow and clunky on the user interface
side of things to be fun.  It's interesting to explore, but not something
that will keep you coming back again and again.  It does allow you to save
games in the CD남's memory and the auto-mapping feature is a definite plus.
But, it just doesn't have the UMPH in the gameplay department.

@NODE GAME2 "Pirates! Gold Review"

PIRATES! GOLD is a game about a historical era.  It also has a history
of it's own.

Going as far back as the Commodore 64 computer, gamers have been putting
themselves in the place of a swashbuckler on the Caribbean.  Fighting, 
sailing and dueling in the name of gold and riches.  Back then, the
game was known as PIRATES!

Now, PIRATES! has returned in a new version, PIRATES! GOLD.  This new
version seems to be the same game with some slight graphics enhancements
and some other superficial tweaking.  Essentially, however, it's the same
game as the one played on the Commodore 64.

That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.  A good game is a good game
no matter what platform its played on...unless something is ruined in the
translation, that is.  Fortunately, PIRATES! GOLD has survived intact.

Unfortunately, this is not a game that tests the CD남's limits.
Now, you're probably going to hear that about a lot of games until one
comes down the pike that DOES push the envelope.  In this case, we're 
not going to count it against PIRATES! GOLD.  It's a good solid, fun game.
It's worth the price of admission, so to speak.

The game casts you as either a young swashbuckler just acquiring his
first ship or as a famous explorer set on completing one of several
expeditions.

The main point of the game is to sail around. (Sounds like fun, huh?)
You can encounter ships on the open ocean and fight or get information
from them.  The information is useful in planning treasure hunts as 
well as attacks on port cities.  You can also dock at some port cities
as long as the flag you're flying agrees with the particular administration
running the city.  While you're there, you can get a stronger crew, buy
a bigger ship or bank your stash.

The game is involving because you never quite know how things are going
to turn out.  Not that the game's unpredictable, but there is a sense of
adventure in the game.  You aren't quite sure who's going to come 
bounding onto your ship with sword-in-hand asking for a fight, for example.

The graphics aren't great.  They're standard Amiga game-type graphics
which are, of course, just as good as something like the Genesis or
SNES machines.  They don't push the envelope of performance and if
not for a rather nice 3D animation introduction, you'd never know it was
a game for a 32-bit game machine.  But, like we said, we're not going to
hold that against it.  The sound, however, is marvelous.  The music is 
wonderful.  Listen for the "remix" version of the PIRATES! GOLD theme!  
It's doubtful this kind of sound could be accomplished on anything less
than the CD남. 

Not every game can be responsible for pushing the CD남 to its limits and
this game more than makes up for what it lacks in graphics with gameplay.

@NODE GAME3 "Mean Arenas Review"

"Yuck!" 

That was my first reaction to the graphics of MEAN ARENAS.  I thought to
myself, "When was this released?"  Scanning the box for a copyright date, I
found that, indeed, this was a new game.  So, I popped the disc into the
CD남 and prepared myself to be disappointed. 

I wasn't totally disappointed.  In fact, I found myself rather entertained. 
That's the sign of a good game.  Unfortunately, it's not all good.  

The major problem with the game is that it's in PAL video mode.  I played
the game on an NTSC CD남 connected to a Commodore 1084s monitor through its
composite jacks.  The CD남 defaulted to an NTSC screen when it booted up.
That caused the bottom of the screen to be cut off.  I had to get the
machine to boot in PAL to see the whole screen.  That wasn't a problem
for me because I had a mouse that I could plug into the second game port.
Using the "hold the two mouse buttons down when the CD남 boots up" trick,
the machine boots in PAL mode.  However, someone who's bought the game and
doesn't have a monitor that can display PAL or the knowledge on how to get
the machine into PAL mode in the first place is, basically, screwed.
Important information concerning gameplay appears in the area that isn't
visible to NTSC users.  That's a BIG minus.

Once that was straightened out, I discovered that the game has a certain
charm.  Combining the "TV show of the future" approach of SMASH-TV and the
maze chase aspect of PAC MAN, MEAN ARENAS is not going to win any
originality awards.  However, it does introduce a pair of comedic
announcers who cover the action and make comments that give the game a
real atmosphere.  That's a BIG plus.

So, what's the game like?  Well, basically, one moves around mazes picking
stuff up while avoiding the "bad guys".  MEAN ARENAS' "bad guys" come in
all shapes and sizes.  Part of the fun is finding out what things in
the maze do.  There are booby traps, power-ups and teleporters.  There are
even switches that move the walls, revealing even more stuff.

Controlling your on-screen character is relatively easy.  It's nice to be
able to get from Point A to Point B without worrying about an awkward
control system.  With the high number of enemies that are after you in
MEAN ARENAS, that's a real comfort.

I don't want to ruin the game by giving away too much of it.  Just be
aware that the game is not groundbreaking in concept or appearance.  It IS
fun to play.  

I hesitate to recommend MEAN ARENAS to everyone due to the PAL display
problem.  To get the full enjoyment out of the game, one has to see the
whole screen.  A regular TV set cannot display a PAL signal.  Doing so
would render the game completely unplayable as well as unwatchable.

If you can display a PAL signal on your monitor then go ahead and grab
MEAN ARENAS.  If you can't view PAL on your monitor or if you are using a
TV set as your display device, wait for an NTSC version of the game.  If
you do get the PAL version, make sure you have an Amiga-compatible mouse
handy to put the machine in PAL mode by holding the two mouse buttons down
when the CD남 boots up and then selecting "PAL" from the Display Options
menu.

MEAN ARENAS is a game that you'll come back to again and again...as long
as you can see what you're doing.

@NODE prev "Previous CD남 Reviews"

A little while ago, on FIDONet, I posted some "spot" reviews of some of the
original batch of CD남 titles available.  Rather than expand those reviews
into something completely different, I just decided to reprint them here.
These same reviews were re-printed in Amiga Report.  (Since I never gave 
permission to have them re-printed in Amiga Report, there really should be
no problem printing them in my own magazine.)

In the next issue of CD남View, I will recap all the ratings from this issue
as well as attempt to translate the star rating system I used for these
reviews into the rating system we currently use.

Here it is...the original review.  The spawning of CD남View!

Here's my personal opinion on the CD남 titles I've seen so far:
(by "seen", I mean "sat down and played for a while")  

Ratings: (*****) = best   (*) = worst

OSCAR - nice platform game, with really good parallel scrolling.  Some of
the screens are too "busy", and it's hard to see what you're doing with all
the stuff in the background.  Well done, though, and just as good as Sonic
and the Mario games.  (****)

PINBALL FANTASIES - not exactly the most eye-catching game, but it is
undeniably the most addictive game I've ever played.  You know it's
addictive when you're hitting the start button for that "just one more
time" for about an hour.  Great CD sound on this one.  (*****)

SLEEPWALKER - I didn't like it on the Amiga, and I still don't like it on
the CD남.  It's not my type of game at all.  It's really "different", but
contrary to what some think...different isn't always good.  The graphics
are not much, and the gameplay is lousy.  Good thing it's free with the
console, because it's not worth buying.  (*)

CASTLES II - A strategy game for those that like medieval stuff.  The 
graphics are good and the CD sound in the intro is spectacular.  
It seems like a game one could get wrapped up in, but it's hampered by the
CD남's controller.  This was a game meant for a computer with a mouse, not
a game console with a keypad controller.  I didn't try plugging in a mouse
on the 2nd port.  It may help...but still... (** 1/2)

LIBERATION - A definite cool game!  3D texture mapped graphics and a large
world to roam about in make this a game worthy of the CD남 and vice versa.
It has a lot of options and is very open-ended.  A lot of fun to explore
and get lost in.  Not a game that one can start playing in two seconds, 
but one that you grow into and don't grow out of.  Really good!  (*****)

WHALE'S VOYAGE - Another crap Amiga game trying to milk the CD남 market
for some sales.  The game is not worth buying for any system.   Avoid at
all costs and at any price.  (no stars)

DEEP CORE - Adequate shoot-em-up with a lot of stuff to blow up.  Nothing
original, just mindless destruction.  Good for what it is.  Nothing
special in the graphics department.  (The intro sequence doesn't not
appear to be converted from PAL to NTSC, so it jumps and flickers...kind
of annoying, but still quite readable and does not affect the game.)
(***)

ROBOCOD: JAMES POND 2 - More platform action.  A lot cleaner display wise
than OSCAR, but not quite as frantic and fun.  Very nice graphics and
sound. (***).

TROLLS - Another platform game.  A little more frantic than OSCAR and a
little more annoying.  So, it balances out.  The graphics are colorful and
the sound is good.  Nothing better than a 16 bit console though, so not
really worth it, if you have OSCAR already.  (They're practically the same
game.)  (***)

ZOOL - The Amiga's Sonic beater comes to the CD남.  A really cool 3D
rendered Zool character is featured in the intro...and that's where the
differences stop.  If you've seen ZOOL AGA on the A1200 or A4000, then
you've seen this game.  Nothing fascinating...just solid play.  I prefer
OSCAR as platforms go. (***)

NIGEL MANSELL'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP RACING - A solid race game.  Much
improved over the A1200 version of the game in an intangible way.  I
didn't enjoy the Amiga version of this game at all for some reason.  The
CD남 version is good, solid fun.  The game is fast, easy to control and a
lot of fun.  The graphics are quite good, and the sound is fair (what do
you what from a racing game?)  Solid entertainment. (*** 1/2)

D/GENERATION - A novel puzzle/maze/shoot-em-up.  Unfortunately, the
graphics are on a par with the old 8-bit NES console and not a 32-bit
CD-ROM based system.  The gameplay is good, but the graphics are a real
letdown.  (**)

ARABIAN NIGHTS - Yet another damn platform game.  Annoying and not really
any good.  There's nothing to stand it apart from the other platform games
on this system other than maybe the price.  It's cheaper than the others,
but remember, you get what you pay for.  (**)

So far, these are the ones I've played.  Far and away the most addicting
game is PINBALL FANTASIES.  It's one of the most fun games I've played on
any system ever.  But, it comes with the machine in the US/Canada release
of the console, and what's going to have to sell the machine are the OTHER
titles.  Right now, LIBERATION and OSCAR are the only other two titles
I'd buy.  (Maybe NIGEL MANSELL too.)

-------

Remember, this was written before I'd even thought of putting together
CD남View.  I'll translate this "star" rating system into the current
system and will print the results in next month's issue. 

@ENDNODE   

@NODE RATINGS "The Ratings - Explained"

We judge the games we review in four different categories:

Graphics
--------
This is pretty self explanatory.  The higher the percentile, the better
the graphics are.

Sound
-----
Another no-brainer.  The higher the percentile, the better the sound. 
Although, this also relates to it's coordination with the gameplay.  If 
the sound seems inappropriate for the type of game it is, the game will
score lower in the Sound category even if the sounds are technically well
done.

Gameplay
--------
The gameplay refers to the addictive quality of the game as well as the
way the game plays.  If you find your self sitting and watching rather
than interacting with the game, the game will score lower than one that
actually involves you.

Control
-------
This refers to how easy the game is to control given the standard CD남 
controller.  A game requiring a special controller that is not specified
or not included will be penalized.  A game that comes with a special 
controller or one that recommends that, say, an Amiga mouse might work
better than the standard CD남 controller will not be penalized.

@NODE SPECS "CD남 vs. the Competition"

Note: This is the absolute LAST time we'll print this list!

(Yeah, it's also the FIRST time, but this is not what we want to get
involved in.)

The CD남 has been reviewed in a number of different videogame magazines.
For some reason, the machine never seems to have the same specs from
one magazine to the next.  It's not because the machine keeps changing, 
believe me.

For what it's worth, we're going to list the CD남's specs and compare them
with the competition as we see it.  We see the Philips CD-I, the Atari
Jaguar, the Sega CD and the Panasonic/3DO R.E.A.L. system as the major
competitors.  

Please remember that specs have a way of only telling half of the story.
Just because one system sounds fantastic in a technical light doesn't 
mean the software's any good.  The software is what will make or break
a videogame system.  Along with the specs, we'll add a few little notes
on each system.

We welcome any comments from any one with better information about the
other systems.  We don't profess to be experts on the other systems, and
it's possible our information is wrong.  We do not want to skew the 
information towards any particular system on the basis of a mistake.

Panasonic/3DO's R.E.A.L. System  (aka 3DO)

PROCESSOR:  32-bit
SPEED:      12.5 Mhz
RESOLUTION: 640x480 pixels
GRAPHICS:   64 million pixels per second animation
COLORS:     24-bit, 32,000 on screen from a 16.7 million color palette
SOUND:      8 channel, stereo 16-bit CD
PRICE:      $699.99  

Notes:  Still a small software selection, although games in development
look impressive.  The high price has caused doubters to rumble about it's
impending failure.  It's still too early to tell and it's possible the
price may drop.  It has been promoted with a limited campaign, but has
a tremendously high profile due to the Panasonic name brand and the
involvement of former EA honcho Trip Hawkins.  Recently, price cutting
has been reported and this may lead to the system's sales picking up a
notch or two.
@ENDNODE

@NODE JAG "Atari Jaguar Spec Sheet"

Atari's Jaguar

PROCESSOR:  64-bit

GRAPHICS:   850 million pixels per second animation
COLORS:     16.7 million colors
SOUND:      DSP with 13.3 Mhz 68000
COST:       $250.00

Notes:  Atari, who let Nintendo sneak up and steal the videogame market 
from them in the late '80's, is apparently back with a vengeance.  They
have awakened their slumbering marketing department and have given this
system the highest profile they can.  It's an impressive system, but
with a software selection that is still too small to make it a "must
own" system.  The cost of the system is for the cartridge based console.
A CD-ROM unit will be available for an additional cost, but price and 
expected availablility date were not clear.

@ENDNODE

@NODE cdi "Philips CD-I Spec Sheet"

Phillips CD-I

PROCESSOR:  Motorola 608040 (not the 68040)
SPEED:      15 Mhz
RESOLUTION: 384x280, 768x560 or a combination of the two
COLORS:     Up to 32,768 from a 16.7 million palette
GRAPHICS:   Capable of full screen full-motion video with DV cartridge
SOUND:      CD Audio up to 1.2 hours, ADPCM Level A up to 2.4 hours,
	    Level B up to 4.8 hours, Level C up to 9.6 hours
PRICE:      $499.00 for basic system

(Note:  I have no way of verifying the above specs so, please if you
can confirm or offer corrections, please do so.)

Notes:  The Phillips CD-I has been around a long time.  It originally
competed with the CDTV in 1991.  (The CDTV actually outsold it then.)  
Phillips have been pushing CD-I hard lately and have effectively 
advertised it's capabilities via infomercials.  The software being 
released now is light years ahead of original releases, but still 
the quality is only evident in recent titles.

COLORS:     Up to 262,000 from a palette of 16.7 million
GRAPHICS:   AGA Chipset
SOUND:      4 Channel, stereo 8-bit CD
PRICE:	    $399.00

Notes:  Like the Jaguar and the 3DO, the CD남 is brand new.  And
just like those systems, it's too early to tell if it will succeed in
the marketplace.  It is selling like gangbusters in Europe, but has
not, as of yet, been officially released to mass-merchandisers in the
United States.  While it is true that the CD남쟦as more software 
available now than the 3DO and the Jaguar combined, that fact is  
misleading.  The CD남 can run some of the old CDTV titles and those
were obviously not developed as CD남 titles.  However, that does point a
finger to one asset the CD남 has, and that's a large developer base
with an established platform.   However, whether that software will be
any good remains unknown.

COLORS:     64 from 512 color palette, 16 when running full motion
	    video.
SOUND:      8 channel PCM
PRICE:      $299.00 (excluding price of Sega Genesis console which is
	    required to use the system)

Notes:  The Sega CD is probably the most successful of the CD-ROM based
game consoles.  Although, most of the time it's been out, there's been
nothing in it's price/performance class.  It has a large number of titles
available, but Sega owners themselves complain that the games are usually
the same as the cartridge versions with only minor enhancements.  (That
is, of course, if there is a cartridge version of the same game available.)
Although it's starting to show it's age, it's still selling quite well
due to Sega's heavy advertising and constant promotion via TV ads.

Amigaman Speaks Out

Fueled by rumors of the impending death of the Amiga in the North American
market spread by doom and gloomers, the president of the large Amiga mail
order firm Amigaman (Computer Basics, Inc.) has released the following 
statement of Commodore's position.

2/9/94
The long road back:

There seems to be a lot to moan about these days in the Amiga community.
Everywhere you turn, you read or hear rumors and critics complaining of
Commodore's troubles. Commodore indeed has been immersed in turmoil and
pessimistic predictions.  In the last eight months, there have been shortages
of equipment and spare parts and a lack of visibility.  Calling Commodore's
US office only gets you an answering machine.  The seeming lack of any
effort here in the US is attributed entirely to one frustrating fact
... the lack of operating capital at Commodore.  After a loss of $350
million last year, Commodore has had a real struggle meeting its financial
responsibilities to vendors and lenders. This has caused Commodore to 
concentrate on other priorities and to focus their money and efforts
where they create the best return.   

Consider these facts:
1. Commodore sells more computers in a month in the UK than they sell in the
   US in a year.  
2. Commodore makes more profit on the units sold in Europe than they do on
   units here.
3. The North American market requires Commodore to build a special NTSC
   version of their computers. 
4. One of the keys to Commodore's success is the CD남.
5. This past fall, Commodore concentrated their production resources on the
   CD남.  There have been no NTSC Amiga 1200s made since September, which has
   drained stock levels down to zero.
6. From September through Christmas, Commodore sold over 100,000 CD남's and
   almost 200,000 A1200 computers in Europe. This compared to less than
   10,000 computers here in North America. 
7. The success in Europe this fall has defined Commodore's road to success
   and currently takes most of Commodore's resources to support and maintain.
 
As you can see, Commodore has had very little incentive to support the meager
North American market at this time. In January, there seemed to be a lot of
concern by those in the Amiga business community that Commodore may desert
the North American market altogether.

But, all is not lost.  Commodore knows that the North American market is the
largest in the world and overall success for Commodore will be defined by
the success of the CD남 in the US. Commodore's efforts this fall in Europe
have been an exercise in preparing for an all out push of the CD남 in
the US in 1994.
  
Several positive signs have surfaced here in the first weeks of February:
1. February 1 was a magic date for CBM with some of their lenders and they
   have made it past that date.

2. Commodore has scheduled their long awaited stockholders meeting for
   March 2.  

3. Commodore has agreed to build up to 5000 A1200s for the North American
   distributors. A1200s should be back in good supply in March, but
   customers should be prepared to pay a little more. In the mid $400, I
   suspect.

4. Commodore has several middle tier chain stores interested in the CD남
   and it looks like they are prepared to release it to the US market in
   March.  Release through normal dealer channels will follow.  The dealer
   channel will also get the soon to be released CD남 compatable drive
   for the A1200.

5. The A4000 tower is reportedly in production as we speak and should show
   up here in the US by early March.  (Remember it's a long boat
   ride over here.)  Best of all, it will be priced just a few hundred
   dollars above the current desk top unit.  Also, soon to be released
   is a less expensive desktop A4000 with an 030 processor.

6. Monitors remain a problem for Commodore, but several distributors are
   moving to bring alternatives into the market.

Despite all the difficulties this winter, demand for Amiga equipment
remains high.  The CD남 is a marvelous machine, far superior in
price-performance to anything else available now.  Because of its success
in Europe, software for it is already flowing very fast.  Limited supplies
of units here as well as the Full Motion Video Module  (which has been
shipping for about 3 weeks)  have been quickly bought up.  There is
nothing like watching a CD VIDEO with its movie theater-like stereo sound.

As Commodore moves to position the CD남 in the North American market, things
will continue to be tight for the traditional Amiga computer channel.  But
if Commodore can carve out a substantial market share for the CD남 in
1994, especially in the Christmas quarter, I think you will find the US
market embracing the Amiga computer like it never has before.  

Remember that in front of the name of every CD남 sold is the word
AMIGA.

@NODE RUMORS "Rumors/Rumors/Rumors"

Rumors...oh, those nasty rumors:

	@{"  Commodore's A1200/Cd남 Add On  " link 12cd} - Is it or isn't it coming?
	@{" Microbotics CD남 A1200 Expander " link micr} - A1200 for your Cd남?

Please remember that all information found in this section is based
on information from sources that may or may not know what's really going
on.

Rumors make for interesting conversation.  Rumors make for active
imaginations.  Don't base purchasing decisions on anything other
than something you've seen or know is true.  

@ENDNODE

@NODE 12CD "Commodore's A1200/CD남 Add On" 

Is the Amiga 1200/CD남 add on coming?

A lot of people have been asking that question since the CD남쟷as
announced.  There is no firm answer yet, apparently.  

It was reported in at least one British Amiga magazine that Commodore has
announced that it's not going to be released.  However, Commodore is 
still talking about it actively as if it were something that is about 
to start shipping...although they're strangely quiet as far as a date is
concerned.

So, is it coming?  We think so.
When?  Who knows?

@ENDNODE

@NODE MICR "Microbotics A1200 adapter for the CD남"

On the flip side of things, Microbotics is rumored to be making an 
expander that will allow CD남 owners to expand their units into a full
Amiga 1200 computer.  This unit is said to fit into the same expansion
slot used by the MPEG module while still allowing the use of the MPEG
module.

It's also possible that there will be a version that will sit under the
CD남, allowing for internal disk drives and card slots.

We probably won't see either version for a considerable period of time, 
possibly up to six months.
