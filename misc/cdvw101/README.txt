Welcome to CD32View!
   
This magazine is dedicated to news and information concerning 
Commodore's Amiga CD32 game machine.  

The magazine itself is in AmigaGuide format.  AmigaGuide is a 
program for Amiga computers that allows text to be browsed through
by pointing and clicking.

The file that contains the magazine is merely an ASCII text file.
It can be read by using a simple text reader on ANY computer platform.  
When used with AmigaGuide or Multiview on an Amiga computer, the text
takes on the form of a magazine.

IF YOU HAVE AN AMIGA, KEEP READING THIS FILE.  IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER
COMPUTER, SIMPLY READ THE MAGAZINE AS AN ASCII FILE WOULD BE READ.

If you're using an Amiga, you'll need AmigaGuide, Multiview or a 
compatible text reader to take advantage of this capability.  

If you click on the icon and the it tells you you cannot read the
document because it can't open Multiview, do the following:  Click the
icon once, then hold down your right Amiga mouse button.  Go to the
Icons menu on the top of the Workbench and select "INFORMATION".  A
window will open and in the area marked DEFAULT TOOL, you'll see the
name of the program it's looking for.  Simply type in the name of the
program you want to use to read this magazine (which in most cases will
be Amigaguide) and then select the save option.  You should now be able
to read CD32View using Amigaguide or whatever program you selected.
