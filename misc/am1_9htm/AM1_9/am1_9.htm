<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, my friends, the Amiga seems to have successfully reached another critical juncture in its history and legacy. It now appears that Gateway 2000, a major PC manufacturer, will be the next owner of the Amiga.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">And what a journey it has been. None could have foreseen everything that has happened so far even four years ago, much less twelve years into history, when the Amiga was first launched. Even the day before the March 27th announcement, many would probably have considered Gateway 2000's entrance far from the realm of possibility.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But surely enough, at a moment of mounting despair and concern when many were beginning to doubt the Amiga had any hope for a future, the South Dakota-based U.S. PC manufacturer stepped in and initiated what now appears to be a virtual certainty, their ownership of the Amiga.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I believe this has the <I>potential</I> to be very good for the Amiga. Bear in mind that just because Gateway 2000 made a bid, it wasn't a done deal without approval from the German bankruptcy courts. Beyond that, we do not know what they intend to do. However, nearly all indications so far seem almost surprisingly positive.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But now on to matters of The Amiga Monitor. If you have been following us regularly, you may have noticed that this issue of AM is rather late, and short of a few regular segments. For that, I apologize; I was quite ill for a time at the beginning of this month, and since then, have been dealing with numerous outside commitments and computer problems. The result is that I had very little time to put this issue together. I'm not making excuses, mind you; rather, I believe that you, the readers, deserve an explanation for this temporary irregularity. We will endeavor, however, to get things back on track immediately. For those who have sent e-mail to me, I promise that if I received your message, I will get back to you, even though there will probably be a delay until I catch up after my extended absence.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But for now, let's keep on eye on where the Amiga/Gateway situation goes from here. For although there is no guarantee of success, neither is there a guarantee of failure - something that before March 27th had been becoming more likely with each passing day - especially now that the Amiga <I>might</I> have its best chance for success ever. But as we so often must say, only time will tell...</P>
