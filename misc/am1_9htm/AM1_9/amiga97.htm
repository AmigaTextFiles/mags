  Well, I finally made it to an Amiga show. This was my first, and I was
  impressed. 915 people attended the two-day event hosted by the
  <A HREF="http://www.icon-stl.net/~barlog/GAC/">Gateway Amiga Club</A>.
  Everyone was friendly and optimistic about the future of the Amiga, which
  was a pleasant surprise for two people going in wondering if this would
  be the last Amiga show.

  The most anticipated exhibitor in the show was a no-show. QuikPak, a major
  contender in the bid for the Amiga, cancelled at the last minute. The rumors
  flying around the show were: 1) They had made the winning bid and were too busy
  in court signing papers to come. 2) They had lost the bid. Neither of these
  rumors could be confirmed or denied at that time.

  The first thing we did at the show after a brief glance around was attend the
  Amiga Internauts Luncheon hosted by Wayne Hunt of
  <A HREF="http://www.amiga.org/">World-Wide Amiga Online</A>. The general topic of
  discussion was ways to improve communication and cooperation among the groups of
  Amiga users on the Internet (ie. IRC, on-line magazines, newsgroups, web sites, etc.).
  If this were to be achieved efficiently, it would be a ground-breaking event
  (something that is rare on the Internet these days). From what I've seen,
  there's more competition than cooperation between companies and groups of users
  of other platforms.

  After leaving the luncheon, we explored the exhibitors' booths. Due to the
  number of people attending the show, there wasn't much chance to talk to the
  exhibitors, as every booth was mobbed by up to 20 people at a time, but there
  was lots to see all the same.

  <H3>Scharp Designs</H3>

  My very first stop was at a booth that caught my eye immediately: Scharp
  Designs. I'm always on the lookout for nifty souvenirs wherever I go, and on
  display at this booth were bumper stickers, bright yellow smiley pins, and Amiga
  mugs that change color when you fill them with something hot. The first
  version of this mug has musical notes instead of the smiley. The day after the
  mugs were finished, the factory burned down and no more mugs with that design
  could be ordered that year. Mr. Scharp had promised a few people he wouldn't
  reproduce the original design, and now the 144 mugs produced before the fire are
  limited edition collector's items. The factory was rebuilt the next year, and
  500 mugs with the new logo were made. Once these mugs are sold out, they too
  will become collector's items.

  To order these mugs, send  a check or money order (no cash) for $13 US plus $5 US
  (overseas, $8 US) shipping and handling to:<PRE>
  Bob Scharp

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
  For orders of 2 or more mugs, e-mail your country, city and zip code to
  <A HREF="mailto:bscharp@icon-stl.net">bscharp@icon-stl.net</A> and Mr. Scharp will
  attempt to get a better shipping and handling rate.

  The Scharps also had a booth with boxes and boxes of disk-based magazines.
  There was a large selection and I could have spent hours leafing through them.

  <H3><A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~amigaatl/">Amiga Atlanta</A></H3>

  Next we went to a booth that had lots of Amiga t-shirts made by Amiga Atlanta. The
  artwork for these T-shirts was done with Amigas. Naturally, we had to order a few
  of these.
</P>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT>
For the last two years, Amiga Atlanta members Aaron Ruscetta and Bob Castro
  (Producers), and Mike Ellenberg and Eric Webb (Videographers) have been
  interviewing Amiga users and historic figures in the Amiga scene. The project was
  started when Escom bought Amiga Technologies to be part of a 2-hour
  teleconference with Escom. Escom folded and the teleconference never happened,
  but AAi had already recorded over 50 hours of interviews, so they decided to
  expand it to a full, hour-long documentary. The aim of this production is not
  just to document the technical history of the Amiga, but also the heart of the
  Amiga community and the cooperation that has kept it alive during the 3 years AT
  has been without an owner.

  The next booth we went to was National Amiga. They had a large selection of
  software available and we bought a copy of The Lion King for our three-year-old
  son. (Now, if we could just get Mommy away from the game long enough for the boy
  to play it... ;))

  <H3>Amazing Computing</H3>

  This is the one and only remaining print magazine in the US that has been with
  the Amiga since the beginning. It was cool talking to these guys because Amazing
  Computing has always been one of our favorite Amiga magazines. We bought a
  subscription from them on the spot. These people have been hanging in there by
  sheer force of will since the demise of Commodore, so <B>get your subscription
  today and show your support for their efforts!</B>

  The portable Amiga! One step closer to that laptop we've all been dreaming
  about. An 18&quot;W × 12¾&quot;D × 4½&quot;H case with an auto-switching external power supply
  (also uses Duracell DR31 Laptop batteries), and a 640 × 480 Color LCD screen, to put
  your 1200 in. I'm told the installation is very easy.

  On display at the SoftLogik booth was the latest version of PageStream. They
  were very helpful about upgrades. It's nice to know that profesional desktop
  publishing is still alive and growing on the Amiga.

  Nova Design, the people responsible for ImageFX, had a very impressive demo
  video on display at their booth. This is a must-have if you're into graphics.

  The Toaster and Lightwave people. What can you say? NewTek has been impressing
  people from the beginning. Their booth shows that they are still one of the
  Amiga's leading supporters.

  I.A.M. is the company founded by Dale Larson, former Commodore engineer. At this
  booth, we got several things: <I>Connect Your Amiga!</I>, a very good book
  containing information on all aspects of networking and the Amiga; S.Y.A. (Save
  Your Behind), a software package containing Dave Haynie's DiskSalv4 and Robert
  Hardy's MRBackup v2.5 (These we had occasion to use as soon as we got home, due
  to a little mishap that occured while we were gone involving our toddler and our
  DEVS: directory. :/); and a bunch of the Amiga/Boing logos originally produced
  by Commodore for use on the A1000's, which we will mischievously stick on any PC
  we come in contact with. :)

  From this booth, we got a demo of TermiteTCP, a TCP stack that promises easy
  installation without the burden of MUI.

  This booth provided us with the hardware deal of the year. Here we bought a
  68030@28MHz board for the 2000 for $20. What luck! Mind you, we can't use RAM
  on the card itself for some reason, so it's not running quite as fast as it
  could be, but who's complaining? :)

  <H3>A Meeting of Friends</H3>

  In addition to seeing all the exhibitors' booths, I got to meet some of the people
  I've been talking to on IRC all this time. Among those I met were Arvid, ScottW,
  Misfit and JigSawMan. In the picture to the right are - left to right - Arvid, Sage,
  and Axem of <A HREF="http://www.es.co.nz/~kinetik/amiga/">#Amiga Undernet</A>.

  That pretty much sums up our experience at the show. Sadly, we didn't get to
  talk to everyone, because every booth was mobbed for the duration of the show,
  but all in all it was a great experience.
