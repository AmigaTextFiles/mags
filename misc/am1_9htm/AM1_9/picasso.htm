<LI>If you own the Fusion Forty and are thinking about getting the Picasso IV, DON'T get it, unless you want to buy a new accelerator also.
<LI>If you own an Amiga 2000 and are thinking about getting the Picasso IV, talk with your dealer FIRST. You have to physically damage the card in order to install it in an Amiga 2000. This is according to the documentation and it's built with this in mind. The bad news of this is that if it doesn't work or is bad in any other respect you are in a world of hurt. Village Tronic will not take the card back if it's been modified for use in a 2000. This, due to the type of modification, limits its resale to 2000 owners, and neither the dealer, distributor, nor Village Tronic wants it back. So you're stuck.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So now you know why this reviewer who paid good money after saving up for what seems like forever and a day for a really special treat is one very unhappy person. You guessed who that is: ME. Sorry this was a very short review, but if I went on from here I would start flaming people that don't deserve it. My dealer tech support was as helpful as they could be without taking a loss. The situation as it stands for a product that is advertised for the Amiga 2000 SUCKS big time. Yes, you can use this product in your A2000 if you want to give up all hope of warranty service on the card from the beginning. Who says Commodore is dead?</P>
