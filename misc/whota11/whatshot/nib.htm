Welcome to the News In Brief Section.  This page contains all articles from 
September.  Enjoy.
<P>
<CENTER><H2>Gloom 3</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/gloom.gif" ALT="Gloom Logo"></CENTER>
<P>
In a previous article, I mentioned that Gloom 3 would be coming out on CD 
and was going to be distributed by Guildhall, well Alpha Software, Gloom 3's 
developers have left the game engine much the way it was for Gloom Deluxe, but 
have included 50 new levels spanning over 7 stages and around 10 new nasties 
with all new GFX and sound.  The game will also improve the fun for multiplayer 
game, as there will be 30 new 2-player combat levels included, which will also 
contain zombies to make things that bit harder and also modem support will be 
much improved.
<P>
To run the game, you'll be able to get away with using a base A1200, but it'll be 
slow in all but the smallest of screenmodes.  To get a decent game out of it, it's 
recommended that you have at least an 030 with 4Mb Fast RAM.  But to play the 
game in 1x1 screenmode an 040 or 060 is recommended.
<P>
But graphics card owners will not left out as the game supports GFX cards, which 
will allow them to play the game in a Workbench window.
<P>
By the way, a demo of Gloom 3 is available <A 
HREF="http://www.xgw.fi/'slice/gloom/files/Gloom3demo.lha">here</A> and the 
latest information on Gloom 3 can be found at <A

<CENTER><H2>The Amiga RC5 Team Effort</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The Amiga RC5 Team has been setup in order to break the RC5 keys in order give 
some exposure to the Amiga.  For more information about their efforts, try <A

site</A>.

<CENTER><H2>Pinball Brain Damage News</H2></CENTER>
<P>  
Pinball Brain Damage was orignally going to be published by Vulcan Software, but 
has now been picked up by APC&TCP, and have just released some new details on 
the game.
<P>
The game will include Hi-Res table graphics (640x256) with 256 colours in normal 
mode and Super-Hi-Res (1280x512) in multiball mode, which is probably the 
highest resolution yet to be used in any Amiga game.

<CENTER><H2>Total Destruction 3D</H2></CENTER>
<P>
A group called Deepcore Entertainment Software are writing the first true 3D, 
polyon based, texture mapped beat-em-up for the Amiga.  If you've seen Virtual 
Fighter and Tekken, you'll know what I mean.
<P>
This game will no doubt require a pretty powerful machine to play it and from 
what I've heard it will require at least an AGA/CyberGFX machine with an 030 
for 320x200, 2x2 resolution and an 040 for the 320x200, 1x1 resolution and also 
2Mb Chip RAM and 8Mb Fast RAM.
<P>
The game is being scheduled for release in Summer 98 and will be on CD-ROM 
only.
<P>
<CENTER><H2>Trauma Zero</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Trauma Zero is a new Shoot-em-up that is being developed by a new Italian team, 
with a demo currently available on the Aminet comprising of 4 separate archives.  
But, the demo isn't playable and is a rolling one, and I've seen it and it looks a lot 
like R-Type.</H4>
The game will contain 256+ colour graphics, will scroll at a super smooth 
50Hz and will feature a simultaneous 2-player option.  The game is AGA and will 
be hard disk installable.
<P>
<CENTER><H2>Explorer Development Page</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Now at the Amiga Nutta Site, a new page has appeared which might be of interest 
of those of you, who are following the progress of Explorer 2260.  The page 
contains all sorts of information on the development of Explorer 2260 and to

<CENTER><H2>Voyager NG 3.0 Announced</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Oliver Wagner recently announced that Voyager NG 3.0 will be expected to be 
shown at the Colonge Amiga show in November.
<P>
The main features of Voyager NG 3.0 include HTTP/1.1 transactions, Javascript 1.1, 
Integration of the Mail and News applications (similar to Netscape Communicator), 
FastMem Blitting of images on AGA systems, and a versatile plugin interface 
capable of handling streamed network data.
<P>
As Voyager NG 3.0 is likely to be more expensive than V2, upgrades from V2 to V3 
will priced at only the difference from V2 to V3.
<P>
But there will be a final release of V2 before V3.0 is released.
<P>

Battle is a new game, which is in the same style as Battle Isle.  At the moment, the 
developer is still looking for ideas, a Graphician, a Musician and prehaps some Co-
Programmers (Language is C).  But this hasn't stopped from going on with the 
development of Battle and now a web site has been set up.

<CENTER><H2>Latest On Merapi and Netconnect</H2></CENTER>
<P>
According to Haage & Partner's web site, a version of Merapi will possibly appear 
at Computer97, in Cologne in November and also Netconnect v2 should be 
available by October.  With Voyager NG v3 more than likely not coming out until 
November, so I think we won't see Netconnect v2 until November at the earliest.
