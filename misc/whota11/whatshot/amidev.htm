The following is from the CU Amiga web site about Amiga Inc. upcoming plans for 
the Amiga.  So read on.
<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT>miga Inc., the new, Dakota based subsidiary of
Gateway 2000, are on the move at last. Darreck Lisle has been appointed to
handle the organisation of conferences and exhibitions, and has told us of
his plans to institute a series of developers conferences. Amiga Inc intend
on listening to what the Amiga community has to say, something that should
be very reassuring to those who have been wondering about the level of
Gateway's commitment to communication.

The first developers conference will take place at the <A HREF="http://www.computer97.de">Computer97</A> show held in Cologne on 
the 14 - 16 of November. This follows The mid
August meeting in Dakota between Amiga Inc boss Jeff Schindler, Petro
Tyschtschenko and a group of guests including representatives of the
Industry Council of Open Amiga, the ICOA. Further conferences are planned
for London, UK and in North America in the future.

<font size=+2> Amiga Inc Needs You</font><br>
<BR>
Amiga Inc are hoping to build a database of developers. If you are a
developer or part of a development team working on projects you feel Amiga
Inc. should know about, they would like you to <A 
HREF=http://www.cu-amiga.co.uk/news/devreg.html>register</A> with them.
Please note that while Amiga Inc are not going to be able to discuss every
single project under development immediately. What they want is to know
what developments are out there, what useful pieces of code they might want
to pick up or help people with, and who are the people they really want to
talk to. If you think that you figure in this category, then all you have
to do is fill in the simple developers <A HREF="http://www.cu-
amiga.co.uk/news/devreg.html"> registration form</a> and your details will be 
sent to AI. If they want to contact you after, they will.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>n related news, Amiga Inc are scheduled to move 
into their new office building at the start of October. They are currently pursuing a
number of hire targets, and hope to have the first 30 people hired by
Christmas. Apparently a few of familiar names will be coming back to the
Amiga and AI are putting together an inducement package which they hope
will allow them to "poach back" some people who have moved on to other
companies.

Petro Tyschtschenko has told us that an OS 3.5, an upgrade of some form, is
likely to be available within six months. Details of what is planned for this upgrade 
aren't currently forthcoming, but we can expect to see a greater degree of 
hardware support, with improved CD-ROM drivers a likelihood, and DVD drivers a 
significant possibility.
<P>
I have to say that I am glad to hear that an upgrade in the form OS 3.5 will be 
turning up in the foreseeable future and also their plans to build a database of 
Amiga devlopers will be gratefully appreciated.
