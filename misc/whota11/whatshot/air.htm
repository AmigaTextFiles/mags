The following is from CU Amiga web site about another new DIY feature which will 
be turning up soon.  So read on.
<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>IR Link is the latest project to feature in the DIY 
Scene section of CU Amiga Magazine. Project XG was the debut project and it's 
been met with resounding enthusiasm. It's not been without its problems, however, 
(see Project XG addendum) but from the feedback gained we have a far greater 
knowledge of the problems that can occur and the capability of most Amiga DIYers.

AIR Link is an adaptation of the InfraRexx hardware/software combination and CU 
Amiga's next revolutionary step is to simplify construction and include the Printed 
Circuit Board on the cover of every issue.
<BR><BR>
AIR Link is an InfraRed transceiver that plugs into the joystick port on an
Amiga. It has the ability to control virtually any InfraRed controlled
device and even allows controlling of the Amiga with any InfraRed controller from 
a domestic appliance. The possibilities are endless as AIR Link's <A 
HREF="http://www.aminet.org/~aminet/dirs/aminet/util/rexx/InfraRexx.lha">
InfraRexx</A> software support suite allows controlling of any Amiga applications 
with an ARexx interface.
<BR><BR>
Even if you don't know ARexx, using it and AIR Link is extremely
simple.<IMG align=left width=300 height=82 src=images/infra1.gif>
For example, to quit Miami 'Address MIAMI;quit' can be inserted in the receive 
instruction for one of the remote codes. 'rx "address INFRAREXX ; CDTV_PLAY" 
entered in the shell will start a CDTV playing a CD. Adding transmit commands to 
Opus buttons, Tool Manager docks, Tools Daemon menus, DefIcon defaults and of 
course your own ARexx scripts is both easy and powerful.

Here's a quick list of features particular to AIR Link;<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Custom designed PCB to fit in tiny 59 x 41 x 18mm box
(pictured)</LI>
<LI>Visible transmit and receive LEDs</LI>
<LI>Suite of fully operational, easy to use and powerful software</LI>
<LI>Easy contruction with no wires, drilling or complex techniques</LI>
<LI>ARexx support, provided examples and common IR code sets</LI>
<LI>Extremely low cost</LI>
</UL>
<IMG width=135 height=117 align=right src=images/repairs.gif>
The kit of components will be provided by <A HREF="http://www.acl.co.uk">ACL
Ltd</A> at a cost of under £15 including box and cable to joystick port.
Construction instructions and software with examples will appear in the
November issue of CU Amiga with the covermounted Printed Circuit Board.
The construction feature will assume no knowledge of soldering and will
include a short tutorial on basic soldering.
