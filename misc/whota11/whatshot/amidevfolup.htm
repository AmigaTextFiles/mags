<CENTER><H2>Amiga Inc. To Host Offical Developers Conference At 
MAE</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The following is the Amiga News Section at the Amiga Web Directory and is a sort 
of follow-up to the <A HREF="amidev.htm">Amiga Inc. Seek Developers article.  
So read on. 
<P> 
We are very pleased to announce that South Dakota-based Amiga Inc.,
will be hosting its first-ever official Developers Conference at the
<A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/tower-bin/cucug-ad-mae.pl">The 1997
Midwest Amiga Exposition (MAE)</a> which will be held in Columbus,
Ohio on November 1 and 2. The show is produced by the Amiga Central
Ohio Network (AMICON) user group and will be attended by many Amiga
software and hardware companies, Amiga industry luminaries and
promises to be a very positive shot in the arm for the entire Amiga
community.

<P>Darreck Lisle, Amiga Inc.'s Public Relations and Events Coordinator
told CUCUG, "The Developers Conference at the MAE show is actually
just the first of a series of international conferences Amiga Inc. will be
sponsoring. We recognize the importance of effective communication and
cooperation between software and hardware makers and the new Amiga
development team here at Amiga Inc. and we are putting together an
ambitious program to facilitate an effective exchange of ideas and
information."

<P>Additional conferences are now planned for <A
HREF="http://www.computer97.de">Cologne Germany</a>, Milan Italy, St.
Louis Missouri, and London, according to Lisle.

<P><b>Amiga Developers Network Planned</b>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cu-amiga.co.uk/">CU Amiga Magazine</a>
announced today that it was contacted by Amiga Inc. and asked to
assist in building a database of Amiga developers. Serious Amiga
developers are being encouraged to <A
HREF="http://www.cu-amiga.co.uk/news/devreg.html">register at the CU
Amiga web site</a> for possible, later contact by Amiga Inc. A
Registered Developers Network will at some point be put together by
Amiga Inc., according to Lisle who also went on to say, "The <A
HREF="http://www.znet.com/~colin/icoa/">Industry Council Open Amiga
(ICOA)</a> will play a big part in the future of the Developers
Conferences, and the Developers Network."

<P><b>Epson Supports the Amiga</b>

<P>In another bit of promising Amiga news, Lisle told CUCUG, "The
people at <A HREF="http://www.epson.com/">Epson</a> have agreed to
work with us and to supply us with everything needed to develop
software and drivers to support their full line of printers and
scanners." This unexpected announcement will come as a relief to the
many Amiga users who have been frustrated by the lack of Amiga driver
support for popular peripherals in the past.

<P>Be sure to check the <A 
HREF="http://www.cucug.org/amiga.html"></a>Amiga Web
Directory at http://www.cucug.org/amiga.html frequently for news about
all of the latest Amiga developments.
