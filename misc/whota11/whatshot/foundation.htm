The November release of Foundation is getting closer and is advancing faster than 
ever now, and is also generating a huge level of excitement amongst Amiga 
owners.<P>
The latest addition to the game is the fighting element, which can be seen in the 
screenshots on this page.  Also the TCP section of this game is being currently 
worked on, and hopefully this should allow users from all over the world to play 
each other.  No doubt that this will be great news for Amiga owners,as there aren't
that many games that have support for TCP out there and there
is also talk of setting up a permanent Foundation internet server which people 
will be able to connect to and play Foundation.

This game is shaping up to be something really special, and has the potential to 
put the Amiga back on the map, as a computer for playing up to date games.  This 
game is destined to be the best game of 1997.
