HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"><FONT SIZE="6">A</FONT>urora Works may 
not be a name that is well known in the Amiga market, but they do have some big 
plans for the Amiga.<P>
Even though they have been around for quite some time, they have yet to release 
their first Amiga game, Hover Bomber which will hit the shops soon.  The game is 
very similar to Bomberman, and builds upon it with features that'll bring it upto 
date.<P>
Unfortunately, the game will be likely to be GFX Card only, since AGA can't handle 
running the game in any screenmode higher than 320x240, so this caused the 
game to miss it's intended September release and also it being too much work to 
get the AGA version up to scratch.  It is possible that the authors will release the 
AGA version as Freeware after the commerical release of the GFX Card version.<P>

At the moment, the game is being planned to run in 3 selectable screenmodes, 8-
bit, 16-bit and 24-bit with the 8-bit version running fine on an 030 with a Zorro III 
GFX Card.  The preferences screen at the start will allow to choose the screenmode, 
audio settings (via AHI), network play settings (TCP, Modem etc) and also the 
option to load new maps, sfx, etc.<P>
But internet play will only be possible if all players are on fast connections which 
are relatively close together as the game is very fast paced and requires a lot of 
data to be exchanged.<P>
The game should be out for before Christmas and will be CD-ROM 
only.<P><BR>

<P>Aurora Works have a number of games on the cards, but they are keeping 
details of them close to their chest.  Zone 99 was going to be their first release, has 
now been put back and will be released after the two strategy games that they 
planned which will both have internet support and will not have the same 
limitations as Hover-Bomber.  One of these games is being described as a sort of 
multiplayer space conquest title, with both of these games being AGA 
compatible.<P>
Another game called Betrayed is set for a Christmas '98 release, but will be PPC 
only.  More on these games and others from Aurora Works as soon as I get them, 
but for more information on Aurora Works and their games, why not goto their
