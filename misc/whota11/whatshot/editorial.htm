Hi,
<p>
This is the very first editorial for the What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine, an offline 
Amiga magazine which will bring all the major Amiga news articles along with 
sometimes more screenshots of games than another Amiga online magazine.
<p>
This first issue should have been out by the end of September, but various 
problems with putting everything together have slowed me down, resulting in this 
late edition.
<p>
This first issue contains a vast majority of the big news which happened in 
September, and so this issue is a big larger than normally would be.  But the next 
issue will be out next week, and will become a bi-weekly for the next issue 
onwards.
<p>
This issue still looks a bit ruff round the edges, but the next issue will look a lot 
better.  Now, September saw a lot of major announcements such as the 
announcement of Voyager NG 3.0, some of Amiga International's plans for the 
future of the Amiga and Nova Sector Enginnering getting a license to build Amiga 
compatible computers, along with loads of announcements of new Amiga games 
coming or just around the corner and the News Section is dominated by such 
articles.
<P>
Now this month's, Site Of The Month is <A 
HREF="http://www.patheonsys.com/nova">Nova Sector Engineering</A>, who 
have on their web site some impressive specifications of their new Amiga 
compatible computers that will be coming out soon and have a mention in this 
month's News In Brief and their web site is definitely one to keep watching.
<p>
In the next issue, there will be a number of articles on Phase 5's PowerPC 
accelerator cards and more games, along with other stuff, with the possibility of 
more information on Nova Sector Engineering's CorDel Alpha and CorDel Nitro 
Systems.
<P>
Before, I end this issue's editorial, I'm trying to get What's Hot On The Amiga 
Magazine on the web, so if you any free web space out there, then e-mail at:
<p>
<A

uk</A>
<P>
Hope that you enjoy this issue, and will read the upcoming issues.
<P>
See you,
<P>
