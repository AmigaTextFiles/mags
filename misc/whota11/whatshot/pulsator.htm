Pulsator is a shoot-em up coming from FullSpeed Developments and it can be seen 
from the screenshots here, that the game looks very good.
<P>
The game boasts many features such as over 512 colours on the screen at once, 50 
frames a second scrolling and a massive weapons systems, that will put all other 
games to shame.  It has been decided yet, how many levels there will be, but each 
level will contain lotsof technical effects such as parallax scrolling, rain effects, fog 
and some excellent light effects.

There will be two versions of Pulsator, one on disk (which will require a hard drive) 
and also a CD-ROM version.  The CD-ROM version will contain extras such as 
animated movie sequences, extras levels and music played directly from the CD.
<P>
Both versions will be released in January next year with a demo coming soon.
