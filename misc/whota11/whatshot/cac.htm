<P>
A long time ago, a game called out for the Amiga called Dune 2,which was hugely 
popular, and is to be released again on CD-ROM for the Amiga, later gave PC 
owners, Command & Conquer, a game which was an improved verrsion of Dune 2.
<P>
But Command & Conquer hasn't made it's way to the Amiga yet, but being such a 
success on the PC, Amiga coders have starting doing their best to try and beat it.
<P>
The following are the games coming our way, that aren't just C&C clones, but 
games that have built on this formula and the Dune 2 formula in a massive way.

Forgotten Forever has been in development since December last year and looks like 
turning into an excellent game.  Strictly speaking, Forgotten Forever is more like a 
Dune 2 clone than a Command & Conquer clone, but from the looks of things, 
Forgotten Forever will be the first one of all of these games to be released.
<P>
The game will be released on CD-ROM only, will contain around 50-60 missions 
spread over 6 different terrains, and also the possiblity of extra mission disks in the 
future.
<P>
There will also be a wide variety of different vehicles and buildings.  The game will 
run in 256 colours and therefore will require AGA, but CyberGFX support will also 
be included along with null-modem support and maybe even TCP support for 
multiplayer games.  Other features on the cards, include digital speech, locale 
support and full multi-tasking.

A relatively newly announced game which is from the same team taht created 
Strangers which has just been recently released by Vulcan Software.
<P>
The game will run in Hi-Res with 256 colours.  It can be seen from the screenshot 
that the game looks very good.  The game itself will feature some excellent enemy 
intelligence, a CD soundtrack and will hopefully be network playable and should 
include TCP play.
<P>
PowerPC and CyberGFX support is also planned, as a lot of games coming out now, 
require a very powerful Amiga.  Currently it will require an AGA/CyberGFX Amiga 
with at least an 030 and 4Mb Fast RAM, will also be released on CD-ROM only and 
a playable demo is promised towards the end of September.

If you are a regular reader of Amiga Nutta and Amiga Flame, you wil notice that 
this game has been mentioned by them a while ago, and promises a great deal.  It 
will not copy the formula of C&C, but will greatly expand on it.
<P>
Graphics wise, this game will contain full light-sourcing, explosions will light up the 
surrounding area, vehicles will have headlights and bases will have searchlights, all 
of these come into play when you undertake the night-time missions which will 
feature in ths game.
<P>
Also the landscape will be true 3D, meaning that hills will obscure a unit's line of 
sight, therefore units will be able to hide in valleys, trees and canyons.  But also 
units will move faster when going downhill and artillery will have a further range 
when at the top of a hill and also the game will include extensive weather effects.
<P>
And if that wasn't enough, the game will also include a massive research & 
development section, also TCP support, level editors and a whole more will be 
available in this game.  Looking out for more on this game as soon as I can find 
out more.
<P>
The game will again be CD-ROM only and will be out sometime next year.

These are only a few of the C&C like games that are currently in development for 
the Amiga, as due out soon from Vulcan is Scions of the Forgotten World, which is 
more of a Warcraft game, and also Hard Corps from Geosync Productions, The 
Game, SpaceLander and quite a few others.  More news on these will be brought to 
you as soon as I have it.
