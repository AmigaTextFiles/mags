<CENTER><H2>QuikPak Update Regarding Product And New Web 
Site</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>The following article was obtained from the Amiga News Section at the 
Amiga Web Directory and is from Quikpak, a company which put a bid in for 
Amiga Technologies after Viscorp dropped out of the running and also were 
unsucessful.  So read the following.</H4>
<P>
<i>From the <A HREF="http://www.quikpak.com/">new QuikPak WWW 
Site</a>, file dated: August 21, 1997</i>
<P><BR><P><b>To:</b> The Amiga Community<br>
<br>
<b>From:</b> David A. Ziembicki<br>
CEO, QuikPak Corporation<br>
<P><H4>It has been a while since I wrote to the Amiga Community. As those
reading this already know, we published a letter welcoming Gateway
2000 and reinforcing our desire to continue to support the Amiga as we
have in the past. To this end we have met  with Gateway 2000, proposed
various new products including our advertised A4040L, A4060L, and
A1630. Gateway warned us early on that they are very meticulous in
planning and that they would need time to review our product proposals
and to see how they fit with their plans. By the time you read this,
we will have met with Gateway 2000 to discuss these and other
products.</H4>
<P><H4>Many have asked why we are not shipping the new products and have
pointed out that we have been advertising them for months. The answer
is that in order to utilize the Amiga chip set and OS, we need to be
licensed by the owner of this technology, Gateway 2000. We are
currently in negotiations for such a license and we are hopeful that
these negotiations will be completed shortly and we can move forward
quickly with an exciting line of new Amiga products.</H4>
<P><H4>This transition hasn't been without problems. We are aware of the
difficulty some of you have had in reaching us lately, and of some
delay in obtaining support. We have addressed the majority of these
problems and anticipate that all of you will be satisfied with the
results. We have changed our Web site and domain name. Our new site is
<A HREF="http://www.quikpak.com/">QuikPak.com</a> and we have added 
some new features to enhance customer service and make communicating with us 
easier. Please visit our site often as this along with our advertising here will be the  
primary means of keeping up to date.</H4>
<P><H4>Finally, my thanks to all of the loyal QuikPak / Amiga customers. We
truly appreciate your support.</H4>
<P><H4>P.S. Please excuse the WIN 95 screen shot on the <A 
HREF="http://www.quikpak.com/page4.html">A4040L</a>, we're just 
kidding.</H4>
