This company has been formed from Digital Anarchy Software, Deimos Design and 
Intuition Software with the intention of pooling knowledge and resources to 
develop Explorer2260, Maim & Mangle and a number of future titles.
<P>
Their primary aim is to develop high quality, high specification games for the 
Amiga market, which will take full advantage of expanded Amigas and PPC 
equipped machines.  All of their games will be developed for playability, visual 
impact, size and scope rather than being constrainded by backwards support for old 
OS and hardware revisions.  Specifically all the planned games require at least AGA 
and OS3.0 in addition to Hard Drives, CD Drives, expanded memory and 
accelerator boards.  Currently under consideration is PPC only and priority 
development.
