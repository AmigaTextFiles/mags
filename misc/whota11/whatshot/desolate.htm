Vulcan Software have just announced another new title that they are adding to their 
ever growing list of games. 
<P>
This game is called Desolate, which Vulcan Software have classified as a mission 
objective scrolling platform puzzler shoot'em up adventure.  At the moment, very 
little is known about this game, except that it will require any Amiga, a Hard Drive, 
an 020, 2Mb Chip RAM, 4Mb Fast RAM, 4x CD-ROM Drive, but it will also utilize if 
available, extra Fast RAM, faster Processors and faster CD-ROM Drives.   The game 
itself will come on 1 CD which will be Workbench exectuable and will also include 
the entire Vulcan Demo Collection.  Support will also be included for the following 
languages : English, German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Dutch, 
Danish and Slovak.  No release date has been announced yet, but I will keep you 
informed about this game, as soon as I can find something more, but in the 
meantime, enjoy the following screenshots from the game.
