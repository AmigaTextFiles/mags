The following screenshots are from Hard Target, which could be called Virtua Cop 
for the Amiga is being brought to us by Vulcan Software.  Currently there hasn't 
been a release date set for it as yet, but from the screenshots, it looks very 
impressive.

Currently I was unable to gain any details on the game, but to run the game you'll 
need an AGA Amiga with at least an 020, 2Mb Chip RAM and 8Mb Fast RAM.  It 
will also require a 4x speed CD-ROM drive.  But if you remember a previous article 
regarding hispec games that ClickBoom! had planned, Hard Target's requirements 
are still a way off.  In the meantime, enjoy the rest of the screenshots, hopefully 
there will be some more news soon.
