<CENTER><H2>Phase 5's PowerUp Accelerator Cards 
Update</H2></CENTER>
<P>There will be several changes to the PowerUp accelerator board product
series for Amiga 1200 compared to the announced products. phase 5 digital
products decided, based on the strong demands from the customers, to expand
the product palette and to offer different processor clock rates. The following
products will be offered</P>

<P><B>BLIZZARD 603e+ Power Board</B></P>

<P>This board will be the first one of the series available for the Amiga
1200 user and delivery will start at the Cologne Amiga Show. It requires
a 68040 at 25, 33 or 40 MHz or a 68060 at 50 MHz as companion CPU. It is
the best choice for an upgrade from a Blzzard 1240T/ERC or a BLIZZARD 
1260.<BR>
The BLIZZARD 603e+ will be - contrary to the announcement - equipped with
two SIMM sockets. A Fast SCSI-II controller is implemented on the board.
As a special additional feature a graphics board direct slot is also implemented,
enabling the customer to use the high end graphics adaptor BVisionPPC without
the need of an additional bus backplane. By using the direct slot, bypassing
the limitations of the Zorro bus system, the BVisionPPC graphics board speed
will beat any known graphics board. The BLIZZARD 603e+ will be available
with PowerPC 603e CPUs running at 160, 200 and 250 MHz.</P>

<P><B>BLIZZARD 603e Power Board</B></P>

<P>This board will be the second member of the A1200 accelerator board family
and will be delivered before Christmas. It requires a 68030 at 50 MHz as
companion CPU and is therefor the choice for upgrading from the BLIZZARD
1230 board series (model II, III, IV).<BR>
The additional features are nearly identical to the BLIZZARD 603e+ Power
Board series, as there are two SIMM sockets, the intgrated Fast SCSI-II
controller and the graphics board direct slot. Also the different versions
concerning clock rates of the PowerPC 603e CPU are the same as with the
BLIZZARD 603e+ Power Boards and will be available at 160, 200 and 250 MHz
