<FONT SIZE="6">O</FONT>lofight is a good looking beat-em-up, which should 
have a playable demo available in a month or so from the Real Ologram.<P>
The game will be AGA only, but suprisingly will run on an unexpanded A1200.  
The most impressive part of this is that it will keep up a frame rate of 25fps on 
this.<P>

The graphics play a big part in this game, with the author claiming to have the 
game running with nearly 5000 colours on screen at once.  This is made possible 
by some special copper routines that the author has written.  Other graphical
effects include all the fighters being 100% rendered, animated backgrounds,
parallax and even shadow effects the actually shadow the fighters moves.<P>
<IMG SRC="images/olo01.gif" ALIGN=LEFT" ALT="Olofight Screenshot">
Also the game will include 10 different fighters with more than 150 animation 
frames for each of them with 10 special moves (attack, defense, other) with varying 
strength for each of the fighters and power-ups to strengthened fighters.  There will 
be objects moving on different parallax layers, behind or in front of the fighters 
and a floor with 3D perspective motion.<P>

The game will support four languages (English, Italian, German and French) both
in the manual and in the game.  The game will also contain some excellent music
that changes depending on how the player is doing.<P>
Like I said earlier there will hopefully be a demo available in the beginning of
October.  The full game will be released around Christmas time on disk only
(Around 8 or so, which will of course be HD installable), there may be a CD version 
to follow this.  At the moment, the authors are distributing the game themselves,
however if there are any publishers out there who are interested, why not give
them a call.<P>
