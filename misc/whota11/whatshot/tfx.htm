This week, sees the release finally of TFX by CU Amiga Magazine, giving the full 
version of TFX on the cover CD, will be available from newsagents on Monday 15th 
September.
<P>
TFX is one of the most eagely awaited games ever, a follow-up to F-29 Retaliator.  
TFX was due out in late 1993, but suffered delay after delay and was then finally 
shelved by Ocean a year or so ago.  The game was all but forgotten, until rumours
started to appear saying that it's release was on the cards again and a petition was 
even started to try and get Ocean to release it.  Then CU Amiga became interested 
and managed to get the game to be given away with CU Amiga.

The game will run along a little slowly at full detail on an 030/50MHz, so no doubt 
a 040 will be needed to play it at a decent speed in full detail mode.  The game 
will also run on a base A1200, but detail levels will have to be reduced 
considerably.
<P>
The game comes in 3 forms, a basic 68000 version, one optimised for FPU 
equipped Amigas and another for 68040+ users.  The FPU and 040 versions are 
highly optimised to take advantage of the extra power provided.

For those of you, who don't have a CD-ROM drive, you haven't been forgotten, as 
CU Amiga will sell the floppy disk version of TFX for £3.50 (plus 50p Postage) 
coming on 7 disks.  Note that stocks of the game are limited and will be given out 
on a first come first, served basis, so don't wait around.
