Hello and welcome to the 18th issue of AmiChannel News.

January is usually a very quiet month. There are not a lot of news, and this
month has not been an exception to this rule. Probably the bigger change is the
new layout of the e-magazine. I hope you think it is for better.

Anyway, Amiga has announced its first partner in crime. As I wrote in the
January issue before the announcement was done, this is Tao Group. Everything
seems correct and going well, but it seems that we will see clouds in the sky.

Some days ago, Amiga have released the executive update. It begins like most of
executive update that we have already seen before. Our president remembers the
goals achieved, he confirms the several meetings that he has attended in his
recent trip to Europe and he promise new achievemts, and very soon indeed.
Actually, we have an appointment in two weeks to know a new partner which seems
to be one of the keys for the path Amiga want to follow. As usual, we do not
know clearly what the future is going to be, but Bill has asked Fleecy to write
a document describing some of the ideas which are behind the partnership with
Tao Group.

The title of this editorial is because this is the feeling I have after reading
it. He says that "somebody is going to say something", and he wants us not to
believe him/them, or at least we should wait Amiga to say something. Who knows,
is he warning about a plan to divide the community, perhaps from one of the
companies which attended the meetings not sharing their ideas? Bill want us not
to believe rumours, but he can not avoid us to think about he has just said.
Clearly there are people who have no solution... Anyway there are positive
things in his message, apart from the usual entusiasm.

Remember to visit the SAUG website, which is located in:

  AMIGA ENTERS INTO A STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP WITH TAO GROUP FOR THE NEW AMIGA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact:
Francis Charig, Tao-Group
Bill McEwen, Amiga Incorporated
425.413.2620

Las Vegas, January 8, 2000 - Amiga Incorporated, a privately held company based
in Maple Valley, WA, has entered into a strategic relationship with the Tao
Group as the new content platform foundation partner for the new Amiga. Terms of
the transaction were not disclosed.

Bill McEwen, Amiga President/CEO, said that the company selected Tao as the
foundation partner for the new Amiga after reviewing numerous other potential
partners.

"After extensive research trawling the markets we found that Tao had the
greatest similarities and strengths with our vision, and the capabilities to get
the job done". McEwen said. "Amiga with Tao together will bring a new level of
capabilities, portability and scalability never available before."

"Tao has its roots in the Amiga so this is particularly satisfying for us" said
Francis Charig, Chairman and CEO of Tao Group. "What makes this relationship so
exciting to Tao is the relationship we can enjoy with Amiga and the Amiga
Community. The world has changed radically in the last few years and there is a
vacuum in terms of content and software environments that meets the needs of the
mass market. The skill sets of the Amiga community combined with the power and
flexibility of Tao's software infrastructure means that the New Amiga can create
the most compelling content for the emerging digital services and content
markets."

@node not02 "AMIGA EXECUTIVE UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2000"
                     AMIGA EXECUTIVE UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

February 3, 2000

Greetings to one and all:

A great deal has occurred over the last couple of weeks, and it is only going to
get more interesting as we move forward. It has been some time since I spoke
with you, and I wanted to share some of the fun.

In the last two weeks we have announced our new foundation partner, started
technical training with our new development team, and had many meetings with
future technology partners

The responses have been overwhelmingly positive and, to quote an old song "they
ain't seen nothing yet".

On January 8, 2000 at CES in Las Vegas we announced our partnership with the
Tao-Group as our foundation OS partner. This is not just a technical but a
strategic relationship and brings with it great rewards. I have asked Fleecy to
write a short document highlighting the Amiga/Tao relationship from a more
technical perspective, to save you from having to put up with my telling
everyone how incredibly great and fantastic it is. We want you to make your own
minds up.

In the next two weeks we will make another strategic partnership announcement
with regards to the new path for Amiga. As with all our announcements, look at
it against the whole picture and not in isolation.

After a week long trip to Germany and the UK I have come back with a much better
understanding of what we can and cannot do. As mentioned before we are not going
to make promises or product announcements. We will announce to you, the
community, only after the deal is signed or the product is sitting before us.
This won't put a stop to rumours, but it will make them all the more obvious.
Change brings uncertainty, and in an information vacuum, mischief makers like to
take the spotlight. If it isn't officially sanctioned by Amiga, don't believe
it.

Our job as a company is to create exciting market opportunities for Amiga
developers to take advantage of, and to give Amiga users a platform they can
enjoy. This requires more than just an upgrade to the existing OS. This
requires, indeed demands a complete strategy reaching into all areas of the
present and the future. The time has come for all of us to move forwards, owner,
developer, and user.

Many of you have sent us business proposals, and product marketing ideas, and
for this we thank you, and ask for your patience as we look over them. Some are
providing us with valuable insight into the desires of the Amiga community as a
whole, others are providing us with a good chuckle. This is the Amiga advantage
that other platforms just do not share.

Over the next few months there may be some companies that come out with their
own plans, or state that we do not have the community at heart as we move
forwards. The reality is, they do not know what we have planned. In order to
stay focused and to keep up our incredible pace, we are not sharing our plans
outside of our signed partnerships.

We have to prioritise and act singlemindedly if we are to reach our first
plateau in our given timescales. Once there we will be able to pause for breath.
Some are not happy about this, but they do not know the full plan. Our mission
is not just about restoring the Amiga, but about pushing it forwards as THE
technology for tomorrow.

This means that if you hear something annoying, or frustrating, or downright
nasty, and the source is not Amiga Inc, then disregard it.

Plain and simple.

If you did not hear it from us, or read it here on this web site it is not true.

We are not asking for your trust or your undying belief. We only ask that you
take us on OUR words and deeds, not on the misinterpretations of others.

We will soon be starting official meetings in Europe, the UK, and the US for
developers and dealers. This will include introductory training seminars for the
new OS, and introductions to the retail pricing and schedules. We will also
begin the process of introducing the new web site, and putting the Amiga
Advisory Council to work.

I want to thank each and every one of you for your hospitality during our
meetings and for your continued support as we move forwards. We have had the
chance to meet with many end users, developers, dealers, and new partners, and
look forwards to meeting even more of you as time goes on.

There is a great deal of activity, with a lot of first footsteps on some truly
amazing paths. New partners excited, old faces returning, familiar faces
reminding us of our heritage. Indeed we are already having to move into bigger
facilities, such is our rate of growth.

I know it can be frustrating but after years wandering lost in a dark place, the
sun is finally starting to crack a smile on the horizon. Together, we will march
into tomorrow.

Keeping the faith,

Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga Team.

Hi,

TWF News.

  1. TWF Opinion Polls
  2. Explorer 2260 Update.
  3. Maim & Mangle Update.
  4. Next News Update

  1. TWF Opinion Polls

     The current poll is still running. With the recent buyout of the Amiga by
     Amino just before the new year, do you think this will reverse the amigas
     fortunes ? So take your pick between; Yes, No or Don't Know.

     Currently the votes are:
      - Yes - 98
      - No - 16
      - Don't Know - 21

  2. Explorer 2260 Update.

     News this month:
      - Altered galaxy structures [down to planet level] to provide more details
        in navigation.
      - Additional work compiled for the CEG including work on the Ovaska,
        Dah'Screwe, Elarien, Mogensen and hyperspace documents done. Will
        appear in CEG in due course.
      - Encountered compiler problems. Investigating alternatives...

     Plans for next month:
      - Remove a colony of bugs from the texture file editor.
      - Complete the entity and object texture editor.
      - The plans for Chris to take over the world have been put on hold till he
        gets those game editors finished. Development must be getting to him. :)

  3. Maim & Mangle Update.

     News this month:
      - Nathan our new programmer has been settling in with testing out the
        current game engine and editors, familiarizing with game design
        documents and setting up a development environment for developing both
        amiga and linux versions.
      - A new Terrain Editor version has been released, which implement new
        routines used on the new engine.
      - Work on the engine itself was delayed a little bit due the intensive
        work done on the StormC implementation of the upcomming minigl link
        library and porting GLQuake ;-)

     Plans for next month:
      - A new and improved engine (40% faster then the current one)
      - Porting of the engine to MiniGL may start.
      - A few updates for the editors
      - A new prototype GUI up and running for the game.
      - Work on the pathfinding and AI routines to be restarted.

Hi

TWF News.

  1. TWF Opinion Polls
  2. Explorer 2260 Update.
  3. Maim & Mangle Update.
  4. Next News Update

  1. TWF Opinion Polls

     The poll hasn't be changed for a good while now but we finally have a new
     one. The previous poll has been asking the question: "What is your
     favourite type of game ?".

     The final results are as follows:
      - Space Sims    - 53
      - RTS           - 23
      - Breakout      -  0
      - FPP3D         - 49
      - RPG           - 57
      - Driving       - 30

      - Beatemup      -  1
      - Original      - 23
      - Adventure     - 20

     The new poll is not games related. With the recent buyout of the Amiga by
     Amino just before the new year, do you think this will reverse the amigas
     fortunes ? So take your pick between; Yes, No or Don't Know.

  2. Explorer 2260 Update.

     Much the same as last month for E2260.
      - Work on the Linux server core routines is continuing.
      - More background documents for the CEG are being created.

  3. Maim & Mangle Update.

     As a result of the recent job advertisement for a GUI programmer for M&M we
     have appointed Nathan Young to the position.

     Most of the programming work in December has been on the internal editors
     used by us for the development of the main game. Primarily this is the
     object editor which we use to texture and manipulate the units and other
     objects for the main game. This has the following added to it:
      - Warp3D support added.
      - Warp3D filtering added.
      - W3D zbuffer added.
      - W3D perspective correction added.
      - clip mapping and double face added.
      - Major speed increase.

     Work is being done on implementing some of the changes made to the editor
     to the main game engine.

  4. Next News Update

@node not04 "TNT PROJECT + EVERYTHING NIGHTLONG + PPC"
                    TNT PROJECT + EVERYTHING NIGHTLONG + PPC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few years ago, before Myst, Quake, Napalm, T-zer0, Nightlong and Z, we
believed that big games could exist on Amiga... We were right. Now, we claim
that Amiga can compete with other platforms. And we intend to do that with TNT
(The New Tomorrow) Amiga project.

In the ywar 2000, clickBOOM will begin a two-fold TNT project:

  1. To bring you more games, both original and conversions
  2. To support the latest hardware

We believe that at this point in time there is no reason why Amiga should not
have all the great games other platforms have.

If Apple was able to regenerate Mac as a gaming platform, we can do the same
with Amiga !

We feel great about what we have achieved thus far on Amiga. But we also feel we
can do more -- more great games. In the beginning we converted two of the
biggest games in the world, Myst and Quake. Then, we released two great Amiga
original games (Napalm and T-zer0). In 2000 and beyond we want to increase the
number of hits significantly, both conversions and originals. We intend to
revolutionize Amiga game development one more time.

Due to our experience, we could fairly easily obtain licenses for more
conversions. However, our current capacity is not able to handle more
development. To make more games, we'll need more top programmers:

   - To develop original, or convert games from other platforms.
   - 3D programmers with extensive knowledge of Amiga and PC.

If you live and breathe to code in C or ASM, contact us at
http://clickboom.com/contact.shtml

The second part of TNT is our plan to support new hardware. Firstly, we would
like to create games that do not rely on AGA anymore. GFX cards offer a lot of
advantages over AGA, and supporting both is tedious, sometimes even impossible.
Therefore, we are making an appeal to all Amiga owners to switch to gfx cards.

Secondly, we have been favorable towards PPC since its inception, however for
reasons already stated in the past, we have not been able to support it through
our games.

But now, we are ready to take our first steps in developing PPC games.

At this time there are two clickBOOM games which will support PPC: firstly,
there will be a legal Quake PPC, and secondly, there will ve Nightlong PPC.

   - NIGHTLONG HARDWARE SPECS

The greatly anticipated Nightlong is almost ready, and the expected release date
is February 15,2000.

Nightlong is planned to be for GFX cards only. And AGA version is under
consideration, but we can't promise yet whether or not this can be done.

Moreover, Nightlong is the first clickBOOM game to support PPC. The kernel of
choice for it is WarpUp by Haage & partner.

For full hardware details please visit Spects section of the Nightlong site.

Futhermore, since Nightlong is almost finished, preordering is now open.

   - NIGHTLONG PPC

Our first steps in PPC support will be experimental, and Nightlong will be our
first commercial test. We believe in PPC and therefore a PPC module will appear
at the same time as 68K version does, regardless of how many PPC preorders we
get.

However, to justify future PPC development we hope to get 400 preorders for PPC
modules.

If we don't get 400 preorders it will probably mean that it will not be viable
to develop PPC versions of Z and other ganes in the near future.

You will be able to find Nightlong PPC preorder counter at The Portal (Note: at
this moment, there are only 92 preorder for PPC module :().

To prevent piracy, the PPC module in Nightlong will be electronically imprinted
with the personal data of each individual customer.

   - NIGHTLONG PREORDERING

Preordering price for Nightlong is $75 CDN (regular will ve $80 CDN).

PPC module is separate and costs $15 CDN (regular will ve $20 CDN).

If you preorder PPC there is one other added bonus: You can chose to pay only
$25 CDN now, and the remaining $65 plus shipping when the games is ready.

To preorder Nightlong now, use The Portal at http://clickboom.com/portal/ or if
you don't have access to the Portal, order at
http://pxlcomputers.com/shopping.html.

TNT and Nightlong PPC are both very exciting and crucial in determining
clickBOOM's future direction. We hope that with your help and support both will
be very successful initiatives.

Best regards,
clickBOOM.

   TAO'S TUMBLER CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOOLKIT OPERATES 100 TIMES FASTER THAN RIVALS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Boston, MA, January 20th, 2000

NTRU Cryptosystems, Inc. has announced the availability of the Tumbler(TM)
software toolkit implementing NTRU, the world's fastest secure public key
cryptography system. The Tumbler(TM) toolkit was developed by Tao Group.
Tumbler(TM) delivers encryption, decryption, authentication and digital
signature features at speeds over 100 times faster than alternative systems,
including those from RSA (Nasdaq:RSAS) and Certicom (Toronto:CIC), at equivalent
security levels.

"The need for public key security is moving from traditional Information
Technology (IT) applications to mass market consumer electronics devices, such
as wireless telephones, portable music players and digital televisions." said
Scott Crenshaw, NTRU Vice President of Business Development. "These applications
have vastly different requirements than IT applications. Solutions for consumer
devices must be fast, inexpensive to implement in hardware, and consume minimal
power. All of the existing technologies, including Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems
(ECC), are just too large and slow. NTRU delivers the ideal solution for the
emerging consumer electronics market."

Key benefits of Tumbler(TM) over the competition include:

   - Fast performance, even on low speed processors
   - Small memory footprint
   - Low cost to implement in hardware (fewer gates required)
   - Increased server performance (supports more users with fewer servers)
   - Reduced battery consumption

Francis Charig, Chairman & Chief Executive of Tao Group said "Tumbler
incorporates unique technologies from both NTRU and Tao. Our development team
has worked with NTRU to develop successfully a toolkit which can resolve many of
the security issues faced by digital appliances on mobile, home and professional
networks."

The technology in the Tumbler(TM) toolkit is ideally suited for applications
where high performance, high security and low power consumption are required,
such as wireless data communications, Internet music and video distribution,
micro payments, e-commerce and embedded devices.

Developed by a team of world renowned mathematicians and cryptographers, NTRU
provides the fastest and most efficient public key cryptography solution - at
all security levels. Unlike other technologies, NTRU resists parallel processing
attacks. Likewise, its disposable key technology allows frequent public key
changes. Those properties dramatically reduce the risk of power analysis, timing
attacks, and the danger of security breaches due to misplaced, lost, or
intercepted keys. Perhaps most important of all, NTRU offers high levels of
security without the performance sacrifices inherent in systems such as RSA and
ECC. The NTRU technology has been extensively studied by both the academic and
commercial cryptographic community. Complete technical details, including a
tutorial, are available on NTRU's web site at
http://www.ntru.com/tech.learning.htm.

NTRU's unprecedented performance advantages open up new options for security.
Its super fast key generation allows the encryption of every transaction with a
different public key. Disposable key use enables completely new paradigms in
encryption - for example, encrypting every second of a music clip with a
different key. That means, on a three-minute clip, the time and cost of breaking
the encryption increase by a factor of 180. Disposable keys also allow every
wireless data transaction to be encrypted with a different independent key.
Unlike other systems that claim to generate multiple encryption keys to protect
media, NTRU disposable keys are completely independent of one another,
dramatically enhancing security. Disposable keys will become increasingly
necessary as insecure channels carry valuable data.

At the heart of NTRU is a collection of mathematical algorithms based on
manipulating lists of very small integers. This allows NTRU to achieve high
speeds with the use of minimal computing power. NTRU is the first practical and
secure public key cryptosystem not based on factorization or discrete logarithm
problems, which require the use of extremely large integers or complex
structures. The computations performed in NTRU involve simpler processes that
can be performed very quickly even on inexpensive 8-bit processors at security
levels equivalent to other public key cryptosystems.

                          PHOTOFOLIO V2.0 ANNOUNCEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Oliver Esberger <oliver@websale.de>

Hi All,

Steeple Software is proud to announce the first commercial release of PhotoFolio
v2.0 in conjunction with Schatztruhe.

PhotoFolio v2.0 is a major step forward from it's predecessor version 1.2 with
may new features including:

   - ARexx

     A fully documented ARex port for those of you who like to automate tasks
     using ARexx scripts. These scripts are made available through pull down
     menus and toolbay buttons and can be pre-configured in the settings
     window.

   - Drag 'n' Drop proofs

     Dragging and dropping of proofs is now supported (by popular demand!). You
     can drag and drop:
      - Between browse windows.
      - Onto a path in the main window's listtree.
      - Onto a Show window.
      - Onto the information window.

   - Workbench Icon Support

     Workbench icons can be dropped:
      - Onto a browse window
      - Onto the listtree in the main window.

   - Toolbays

     Both the main and browse windows now have toolbays (optionally, of course!)
     making navigating around PhotoFolio v2.0 faster and easier. Those of you
     who don't like using context menus.... this is for you!

   - CLI support

     You can launch PhotoFolio v2.0 from a shell, passing in paths. Each path
     passed in will automatically be added to the main window's listtree and
     then opened into a browse window.

   - Listtree Tree mode

     The listtree in the main window can now be operated in the current "flat
     mode" or as a proper directory tree structure in "tree mode".

   - Native IFF-ILBM loading

     Imageio.library has been re-written to support IFF-ILBM. This means there
     is a dramatic increase in speed when loading IFF-ILBM files.

   - Amiga DOS pattern matching

     Selecting proofs has never been easier. Using the in-built Amiga DOS
     pattern matching system, proofs can now be selected using wildcards etc.

   - Saving of images as JPegs

     Images can now be converted to jpegs directly within PhotoFolio v2.0.

   - Settings

     The setting window has been totally re-designed and re-written making sure
     your prefs file is completely compatabile with future versions of
     PhotoFolio.

   - Unsaved proof indication

     For those of you who run without any text description below the proofs,
     knowing which proofs are saved and which aren't is a problem. Now, a red
     box is (optionally) drawn in the bottom right hand corner of un-saved
     proofs.

   - Constant size proofs

     Proofs can now be displayed at a constant size, making the distribution of
     proofs in the browse window even.

There has also been several minor improvements and additions, and many bug fixes
from version 1.2 making it more stable and flexible.

These new options coupled with the the existing features of PhotoFolio make it a
formidable image cataloguing system for both the amateur and professional user
alike. With continuing support, PhotoFolio promises to be one of the most
powerful image cataloguing systems available on the Amiga platform.

PhotoFolio v2.0 is planned to be released in early to mid February. Price has
yet to be decided, however users who have paid the shareware fee will receive a
discount on the retail price.

@node not05 "PHANTASMAGORIA IS COMING"
                            PHANTASMAGORIA IS COMING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indulge Your Taste For Horror!

Alive's BIGGEST ever game is coming....
Be prepared to be scared out of your mind because the master of interactive
horror - Roberta Williams - is coming to the Amiga in style.
So be prepared for a terrifying tale of a womans fight against the forces of
evil... An unparalleled mixture of Hollywood techniques, combining digital sound
effects, computer rendered worlds and interactivity. The whole game unfolds in
chapters, like a novel, to reveal a frighteningly realistic nightmare, from
which you may never awaken.

As the Alive team are hard at work on the new Phantasmagoria web site, I thought
it best if we gave you some questions and answers.

   - What are the Requirements for Phantasm?

No definate answer as yet, but I can confirm it will be no less than '040. If
you have a look at pic6 you'll see that you can reduce the screen size when the
game goes into full motion video, then when you go back into the actual game it
will automatically default back to full-screen. We will support PPC and all
graphics cards.

   - Is this an Interactive Video game?

No. The entire game is a mixture of 3d and hand-drawn graphics, with a healthy
dose of video footage incorporated into the graphics. For example, you may be in
a 3d rendered room, with computer animations, and a video footage sequence of
the actors laid over the graphics. At the beginning and end of each of the seven
chapters, you watch a breathtaking sequence giving you the next stage in the
story. Again, these are not just film sequences, they are high quality graphics
incorporated with realtime full motion video.

The actual game plays in a point and click fashion similar to the likes of Simon
the Sorceror. You have an inventory box on view, and you move your pointer over
certain objects in the room, some of which you can examine, collect or use.

   - Are the sreen shots from the actual game?

Yes, all of the screen shots previewed in this email are taken from the game,
except Pic6, which is from a cut sequence.

   - How many CDs is Phant on and when will it be out?

This is a tricky one. We are considering releasing Phantasmagoria in chapters
over 7 months. The game itself is on 7 cd's. We may well just release the whole
thing at once, but if the demand is anywhere near the response we've had so far,
then we may well not be able to cope with the duplication - we'll just have to
wait and see. The good news is, we are not too far from completion now - 95%
complete.

   - Is this game as big as Alive are making out?

NO. In fact it's even bigger - we're just being modest! To give you an idea of
the scale of the game, consider this... Several months in a hollywood studio
were spent in filming the actors. The soundtracks was composed and procuded with
a full orchaestra, and a complete operatic choir were enlisted for the ghostly
singing. The script for the actors was over 500 pages long, and the writers
spent 6 months doing historical research to ensure that everything about the
game was from the correct period and fitted in with the ancient Carnovasch
mansion. Many artifacts seen in the game were actually on lone from various
museums in America, to ensure that Phantasmagoria is perfect in every way
possible - even historically.

More details of the making of this game will be out soon, but you will already
be building a picture for yourselves of the enourmosity of this game. This
truely is the biggest budget game the Amiga has ever seen.

   - Does this game really deserve the 18 rating or is this just hype?

Right lets get one thing staight. We're not messing around when we stress that
this is an adult game - and neither were Australia when they banned it outright,
or America when they cut many scenes from it to bring it down to their 18
certificate. This is the computer game version of The Exorcist. If your stomachs
strong enough then you'll be glad to hear that the Amiga version is the complete
directors cut of the game with all scenes left in tact. The box features a huge
warning, which we strongly suggest you take seriously.

What to look out for....

February will see the next issue of The Pulse hitting your doorsteps (issue 11).
This exciting issue features an exclusive interview with the best selling author
and creator or Phantasmagoria - Roberta Williams.

There will also be a colour glossy flyers out soon giving Pulse subscribers the
opportunity to pre-order.

On the CDcatalogue 1.6 there is a world exclusive trailer of the game. Alive are
currently working on a demo.

Price is yet to be confirmed, but you will be kept posted.

                  NEWSROG AMIGA NNTP CLIENT CEASES DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Steve_K" <srk@frii.com>

04-Jan-2000

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

ShadowWorks Software regrets to announce the end of the NewsRog project for the
Amiga. NewsRog is an NNTP News client running on Amiga personal computers.

Unfortunately, due to a combination of factors which include the lack of a
market for Amiga software, obsolescent hardware, and a recent increase in piracy
and fraudulent credit card orders, it is no longer financially possible to
continue developing NewsRog. The last version stands at 1.8b, and the update is
available to all registered users via the web page below:

   - http://www.frii.com/~srk/ShadowWorks/Preview/NR.html

ShadowWorks Software is proud to have pioneered a large number of news client
features that have yet to be duplicated in any other software that we are aware
of. We regret that it was not possible to continue development of the software,
since there was a great deal more planned for the future.

ShadowWorks Software wishes to thank all of our loyal customers who have
supported our attempt to bring the Amiga a world class NNTP news client.

                     FLEECY MOSS OUTLINES AMIGA'S PLAN ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "fleecy moss" <fleecy@earthlink.net>

In my trawling around the community hangouts, I have come across several
misconceptions, rumours, and a lot of confusion. Whilst I can't hope to answer
everything, here are some things I want to set straight.

  1. Amiga will build a digital content universe. Digital content means anything
     composed of 0 and1 - applications, video, audio, games, emails, whatever.
     We will focus on 2 markets, the pathfinder market, for digital
     adventurers, power users, gamers, content creators, DTPers, artists, video
     ppl and those who refuse to define a computer as a digital appliance. Our
     second market will cocentrate on the Domestic Digital Habitat (DDH).

  2. If you are a personal computer person, there will be a personal computer
     second wave Amiga.

  3. We will support classic development in so much as we want to help users and
     developers transition to a new machine. That will be the total extent of
     our support for the classic machine. If this involves further AmigaOS
     releases, then so be it.

  4. We are targetting x86 and PPC for the first consumer release of Pathfinder
     products (if you are a personal computer person, this means you).

  5. We will do everything in our power (that doesnt bankrupt us or interfere
     with our primary goals) to ensure classic Amiga software runs on the new
     machine in some form or another.. The new Amiga product family (formerly
     called AQUA) will run natively and hosted. This is to create a large
     market fast for Amiga developers to profit from. For the first pathfinder
     release it will run hosted to see this market grow fast. We see one of our
     core duties as serving the developers.

  6. We are talking to the Phoenix Consortium about common interests.

  7. We have been contacted by QNX but currently have no plans to work with
     them.

  8. We will develop Amiga products for another market, the Domestic Digital
     Habitat (DDH) market. This markets will be kept separate but products will
     work together if the installer so desires it.

  9. There will be a new website and it will be public shortly. It has been
     tested on all browsers, Amiga and non Amiga, and given the compatibility
     problems between the implementations of open standards, our best effort
     has been made. The site will grow quickly and more information will be
     added. We want it to become a village where all Amigans can come to voice
     their opinions, chat, and travel off to different parts of the Amiga
     universe.

 10. A developer support manager has been selected and they are working on
     implementing the developer support program. This will be in place before
     the developer boxes are released.

 11. The developer boxes are specced out, we have contacted several whitebox
     manufacturers and we are building the distribution.

 12. Amiga will not provide dates until we have a product. We will share
     timelines, but will not attach dates to them. Enough damage has already
     been done.

 13. We have had acceptances from 75% of our development team and their names
     and roles will be announced once we get back from training (before the end
     of the month).

This mail can be redistributed without modification within the community. As
further questions and issues come up, we will attempt to answer them.

@node not07 "AMIGA MEETING IN READING, ENGLAND"
                       AMIGA MEETING IN READING, ENGLAND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Held on January 20, 2000

A Report by Open Amiga - January 23, 2000
By Open Amiga President, Steve Crietzman

   - Background

In a phonecall with Bill McEwen, President & CEO of Amiga, COSA was informed
that a gathering of prominent members of the Amiga community was taking place in
Reading, England. We were invited to attend, and told that we should contact
Andrew Korn, Editor of AmigaActive, for more information.

We happily obliged, and on the 20th January 2000, I was present in a room with
room - a Tandori restaurant to be exact - with approximately 25 other Amigans -
everyone from Bill McEwen and Fleecy of Amino, Tao Chairman Francis Charig, Mick
Tinker of BoXeR fame, Andrew Korn and David Stroud from AmigaActive, Ben Vost
(Amiga Format), Olaf Barthel (OS 3.5), and many others whose names escape me
right now.

The story, of course, doesn't begin there.

It begins at a pub called the Hope Tap. I arrived early, 5:15pm to be precise,
while the meeting was schedule to begin at 6pm. I was in town at the time, and
decided I'd get a few early drinks while I await the rest of the gang to appear.

Six o' clock comes and I'm starting to get worried. Until I realise they had
quietly been gathering in a place where I couldn't easily see them from my
position up front at the bar. So I go over, and sit down next to Ben Vost.

Well, Bill and Fleecy still hadn't turned up by this point, so I was beginning
to get a little concerned. We all assumed they were going to be a little late,
so we were patient. We waited. And waited. And waited. 6pm came and went. So did
7pm. So did 8pm.

By now, I was getting very worried. I had come down mainly to discuss a few open
source issues with Fleecy and Bill relating to patents, trademarks and various
source code issues that had been raised and which AROS members had passed onto
COSA to ask at the meeting. I had even booked a night at a reasonably expensive
hotel, and was beginning to feel it had been a waste of money.

So, at 8:30pm, myself, Ben Vost, and about half a dozen of us decided we weren't
going to wait any longer. So the AF group headed off to the Tandori we had
arranged to meet at. The AmigaActive Crew stayed behind.

So, around 9pm we arrived at the Tandori restaurant. No tables had been reserved
by Mr. McEwen. Or Mr. Moss. We started to worry. Then the guy we were talking to
suddenly said, "We have a booking for Amiga?" A huge sigh of relief all around.
"They are over there at the back. They've been waiting for you since 6:30pm."

   - The Evening Begins - At Last

So, after the mess had been cleared up, and the confusion cleared, we all began
to sat down. Of course, I did point out that really someone ought to go back and
tell the AmigaActive gang. Of course, people just grinned and we decided to be
seated. They'd figure it out eventually ;)

And we were right. At 9:30pm, they all arrived. Now the meeting could begin. It
may be over 3hrs late, but who's counting. Shit happens.

And so we all began to sit down. Not long after we were all together, Bill
McEwen introduced everyone and started to pass around Non Disclosure Agreements.
This meant that anything we would hear from Bill or Fleecy on "The Presentation"
would have to remain a secret. The subject, of course, was the future of Amiga.
That much I'm sure you could have all guessed. What you couldn't have guessed
followed in Bill and Fleecy's almost two-to-three-hour presentation speech that
followed.

As well as being treated to a wonderfully energetic and information-packed
session, we were treated to lots of Indian food, curries and beers etc, all paid
for on Amiga's tab. Whoever said there's no such thing as a free lunch? I had
lunch, and it was free. At least, it was free for me. That's all that mattered -
I had lunch, and it was free to me. ;)

The AmigaActive crew was giving away free issues of their magazine, including
sneak previews of their next issue. Most everyone else, including Bill McEwen,
Francis Charig etc. were giving away business cards. I felt left out. If I would
have known that this was the "in thing" to do, I would have created a few COSA
business cards for everyone. Oh well. I'll know next time.

Everything was wonderfully informal, fun and rousing. Enthusiasm was definately
present in that room, although of course a few people privately expressed
concern in private after the presentation, about the lack of any connection with
the Classic Amiga. Everyone was pleased to hear, however, that H&P would be
developing AmigaOS 3.x and 4.x for PPC, having been given permission to do so by
Bill and Fleecy's Amiga.

   - COSA and Open Source

I was obviously there as a representative for COSA, and so I would be remiss if
I didn't cover the open-source issues that were mentioned at the party.

Fleecy Moss publicly confirmed Amino's support for an open source future for
AmigaOS and gave backing to COSA and AROS to "do what [we] could with it."

He did add, however, that there were legal and patent issues involved that were
far more complicated than anyone could have anticipated. COSA was already braced
for the news that patents would have to be addressed, but we suspected it would
be a relatively straightforward matter, of getting the OK from Gateway to use
them, write up an Open Source License granting permission for them to be used in
AmigaOS, end of story.

But it is not quite that simple. The patents have been registered under a
variety of names, of companies and individuals, and many obstacles still exist
that need to be worked through. So it could take time. Amiga are committed to it
happening however, they genuinely support and back the idea, and want to "give
the AmigaOS back to the community that made it what it is." And so they have set
their lawyers on the task, as of three weeks ago. Their task is to make
open-source legally "okay", then make it happen.

We also discussed with Mick Tinker our plans to produce and sell Kickstart ROMs
burned with Kickstart ROMs created by COSA/AROS, and the shortage of
AMD27C200/MX27C2100 and AMD27C400/MX27C4100 EPROMs, the type used on the Amiga
motherboard for the Kickstart ROMs. He responded by informing us that the BoXeR
uses Flash ROMs, bypassing this problem, to which we are relieved to hear.
Upgrading older Classic Amigas, however, may pose more of a problem - but not a
problem that cannot be deconstructed.

We briefly discussed with Olaf Barthel the subject of OS 3.5 and open source. He
confirmed he is not opposed to open source, but does feel that such an endeavour
needs to be carefully and diligently handled, a fact on which both COSA/AROS and
Olaf Barthel are in total agreement. A fact which refutes claims in the press
that we are "at odds", or that we have opposing views on the subject. We do have
differences of opinion, to be sure, but we are not trying to destroy each other
as in a matter/antimatter reaction - just discuss some concerns. It was a
pleasure to meet Mr. Barthel, and I repeat here what I told him there: OS 3.5 is
a wonderful piece of work, and we owe him. Thanks, Olaf, for helping to create a
great product!

   - Summary and Conclusion

I found the meeting fun, enjoyable, exciting and uplifting. It was nice to be
able to meet up with fellow Amigans and to get to put faces to names. Ben Vost
tried to lure me into a debate on Open Source, but I passed on the opportunity
and worked to end the debate as quickly as possible. I wasn't there to debate or
argue, and wasn't about to be lured into that old trap. If Ben wants to hear
COSA's arguments in favour of open source, and to write a piece for AF, he's
going to have to try a different way :)

AmigaActive, to their credit, did not take such a confrontational attitude,
instead offering us the chance to write an article for the next issue of
AmigaActive, an offer I have greatfully accepted :) Look for a 350-700 word
article in a future issue of AA.

To conclude, all I can say is that I am excited by Amino's plans for the future,
and excited by their continuing support for Open Source. If they keep their
promise to Open Source the OS if possible, and it is possible, that will allow
COSA/AROS's collective dreams to become a reality. (To that end, COSA is
preparing a formal Strategy Brief which we hope to have ready soon.)

The hard work now begins, and COSA must make some structural and organisational
changes in order to be ready for the day that AmigaOS goes Open Source. We need
to become a nonprofit corporation and appoint our first board of directors. We
need to become a registered nonprofit foundation and create our articles of
incorporation, a formal mission statement, open a corporate bank account, and
such like. I am personally looking forward to the challenge, which I will
embrace. The future with Amino looks bright for both the Classic OS and systems
(through COSA/AROS), and the next generation OS and systems (through
Amiga/Amino).

Let's get going. Whether your heart lies with the Classic and COSA/AROS, or with
the next-generation systems of Amiga/Amino, we finally are "Back for the Future"
!

President, Open Amiga Group

@node not11 "LIVECHAT WITH TAO-GROUP AND FLEECY MOSS"
                    LIVECHAT WITH TAO-GROUP AND FLEECY MOSS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[breed-away] I Would like to welcome Francis Charig and Fleecy Moss to the room

Senex        1) One thing "Amiga Aurora" (my suggestion for the new OS's name)
             MUST have: Screens - so how about Screens, Datatypes, FFS-support?
             2) Why not calling the product family just "Amiga", i.e. "Amiga
             Aurora", "Amiga XYZ", etc.?
Charig       We will be working with Amiga, taking a close look at the existing
             features and making sure that the new system will have the same or
             greater functionality.

Netsplit^    When can we expect to be reaching for our checkbooks, to buy
             something new from u guys? & when might it be?.
Charig       Bill's in the room and Fleecy can't talk! :) Announcements on this
             will come when the product is ready to ship. No more hype!

Urizen       Will you support hardware-accelerated OpenGL?
Charig       intent(TM) supports hardware accelerated 2D and 3D graphics. As for
             the 3D APIs that sit on top, we encourage all 3D APIs to be ported
             across. Have you heard of Renderware? :)

tOmAsH-BB    What is the real cooperation level of TAO and Motorola? I mean,
             does Motorola want to use your (Amiga?) software, and vice versa?
Charig       It is publicly known that Motorola is releasing connected
             appliances utilising Tao's software (e.g. Timeport P1088 smart
             phone, see announcement 8.1.00)

dreamstar    Will Elate be used as the next generation OS of future Amigas?
Charig       Specifics on this will announced shortly. :)

Firebird^    Hello Mr. Charig, my feeling about Gateway 2000's (Old Amiga Inc.)
             plans for using Linux as the OS of the new machines is that it
             would be a mistake. It wouldn't be an Amiga, just a Linux box with
             the Amiga name slapped on it. I hope this isn't going to be
             planned. ;)
Charig       That was a statement!

Elektro      Fleecy: please describe the new amiga Computer(!) thnx :)
Charig       "It's lovely and cuddly" says Fleecy

sNAK3^RP     Will there be a Os4.0 chipset?
Charig       If you mean, "a new chipset for a new Amiga" then the answer is
             that the new Amiga has been designed to be hardware independent,
             hence Tao.
Charig       This is why we are partnering together.
Charig       Also I want to add a couple of other points.

sNAK3^RP     Will we still have Os? as such...
Charig       The main objective today is to correspond about intent(TM) rather
             than have extrapolations about the precise configurations of the
             new Amiga.

TheB         What is the Amiga "history" that TAO has? It doesn't seem very
             comforting that you have to take a look at the Amiga to figure out
             what it's about. (As for Firebird's statement.. that's true of any
             new "Amiga".) And as for this 'hardware independent' Amiga.. is
             that like java? :)
Charig       Have you looked at our website to see what technology we offer?

amiga-news_d 1st question: TAO: It was reported you helped funding the Amiga
             buyout. How much of it was "your idea", means, are you tech
             supplier, partner, or even more? 2nd question: Will VP Code and/or
             Amiga documentation be freely available for the "just curious"?
fleecy       We talked to Tao when looking for partners and got so horny about
             each other that Tao dropped us some VC names and made introductions
             and recommendations about Amiga.
Guest45753   Tao is our foundation supplier. Amiga will be providing all the
             support. Anyone who signs up to develop will have access to full
             APIs.

Swarfega     Apple's new OS X has a lot of it's GUI done with vectors, which
             allows easy scaling, rotating, etc. of pretty much anything on the
             screen. Will that sort of thing be possible with new Amigas (or is
             the OS extensible enough to allow people to write their own
             interfaces)?
charig       We are not intending to have matrix style transformations embedded
             in the lowest layers of the graphics subsystem as this inherently
             slows down all other graphics functions.
charig       Such vector type operations are available higher up.
charig       ...where they should be.
charig       Remember... elegance through simplicity and performance.

dark4ces     Would there be any performance benefit to writing code in VP
             assembler rather than higher-level languages?
charig       There will be the same benefit that writing an assembler over high
             level languages offers in any other environment.
charig       You trade off slightly higher development effort in order to gain
             tighter, faster code.
charig       Remember that writing in VP gives you the advantages of assembler
             but no portability drawback.

AmigaDragon  (1) Will the new system (HDW or SW) have equivalent (or higher)
             filesystem support such as CrossDOS/CrossMAC including Windows
             longfilenames? (2) Fleecy, will we see, sometime in the not too
             distant future, AmigaOS (classic) Open source?
fleecy       Me and 4 of the dev team have been VP for 2 days now and it's
             nothing like traditional assembler, more like C with the crap bits
             taken out. You'll find out soon.
Guest78547   Answer to AmigaDragon - Q1 - You can mimic multiple file systems +
             they also have their own high performance native file system.
Guest78547   Amigadragon (2) - our lawyers are looking into it but it is a much
             more complicated web than anybody could guess.

TheRiley     if someone wanted to build an "Amiga"-desktop based on, say, the
             POP-standard, and use your new OS , would you support it (and if,
             how)? could the new OS run on phase5 Amirage for example? (ok,
             that's 2 questions, but they overlap so much that they are
             basically one :))
charig       1. Yes. 2. Bill was talking to Gerald Carda yesterday. :)

HaXoR^       Mr Charig / Fleecy, is it just a coincidence this conference
             happening immediately before the transmeta cpu lauch(5pmGMT)?
charig       Yes. We are hardware independent.

Cpt_Hbl^     How long has Amino/Amiga and Tao been co-operating ? We know all
             about Fleecy/Bill/Petro but how does Toa feel about Amiga
             community?
charig       We have a large amount of respect for the Amiga community which is
             why we have been working cooperatively with Bill and Fleecy for
             some months, determined to make this really happen.

BJS          The times of home computers of the 80's are over, i mean, what does
             a CHRP board with an strange OS with Amiga in common, other than
             the name, it's just marketing. and the things done from 1994 till
             now are only done for the existing userbase and they shrunk, how
             will you encourage others to buy amiga?
charig       By providing the best platform.

Thy          Do you plan to do advertising ? Considering that it should be
             worldwide, can you afford that ? To have the best machine is not
             enough if nobody knows that.
charig       Yes. We will be doing advertising (Tao and Amiga) with our
             partners.

Senex        How many developers are working currently on "Amiga Aurora" (i.e.
             the new OS <g>), and how many of them are from Amiga, how many from
             Tao?
charig       Amiga has a dozen engineers growing, Tao has 60 + plenty of blue
             chip partners.

RUiNa        Please take this all as one general question about marketing. With
             consoles and settop boxes allowing more ability and connectivity,
             and with super low pc prices, do you feel we'll compete with these
             pricewise or are you moving towards some other newer market? We all
             know marketing was the original amiga downfall. Is the marketing
             planned and being taken care of by pro's?
charig       Yes. We like to call them "hookers".

FryG_away    Will there be any new updates for WB3.5 ?
fleecy       We have a transitional plan for the Classic that we will announce
             with our partners.

Nico_Barbat_ Francis, Bill told on the press-conf. that you are an long-time
             Amiga-fan - in which effect could this be useful for the developer
             group? WHO is actually working on the new OS?
charig       I'll take those in reverse order.
charig       We already have the foundation layer. I'm not going to discuss o/s
             specifics today. The entire Tao engineering staff is working on
             software which will be utilised by the Amiga community.
charig       Remember that it is not just that we are fans, we also have major
             Amiga engineering history at Tao.

sNAK3^RP     What year will we see the Adverts or price lists?
charig       This year.

|MB|         Hello. I am a convinced amigaist, but in what this new repurchase
             is it different from the precedents? How long will last your new
             development?
charig       What?

Szczepan-Bla Does new Amiga (or what is named) will have full support for
             "Classic" Amiga apps running just like normal one ? I mean that I
             can use any current program to edit/view/etc. any file from disk
             (not like it is in UAE).
charig       Announcement soon.

ioni         Will there be PCI, AGP, USB, etc. ports in the 'new Amiga' ? And
             support for them ?
charig       We will support all significant hardware standards.

Reticuli     Guest45753 stated earlier (whoever that was and is now :-) ):
             "anyone who signs up to develop will have access to full APIs"...
             The API's WON'T be public domain? Is this wise? The Amiga excelled
             because of the back bedroom developers who just decided to have a
             quick dabble one night and has survived years in the wilderness
             because anyone could program it without having to become a formal
             developer. Or did I misinterpret that answer?
charig       You are assuming that the development kit is going to be expensive
             ... it won't be.

CraiK        Q: I have got several commodore amiga computers including amiga
             500, 1200, and CD-32, along with commodore 64. All i want to know
             is, what do you expect the future of the AMIGA world will be like
             (in general)? bright or dark? I just want you to make me feel
             comfortable about the AMIGA's future. I come from the middle east,
             btw just to let you know that we also DO care about the MIGGY ;)
             and thank you very much for your time, sirs.
charig       Of course it is going to be bright. Tao's heavily in demand with so
             many global consumer electronics companies.
charig       We regard the Amiga as a fundamental part, not just of our strategy
             but the whole future of digital content.
charig       One more question.

situation    Okay, I've not asked a question yet, so here goes... How confident
             are you at taking on the industry giants, Microsoft, Intel, et al
             ... and winning?
charig       Tao is already becoming very successful and we know that the
             co-operation will accelerate our success, Amiga's and the
             community.
charig       Thank you and Goodnight from Reading England :)

            AMIGA AND TAO-GROUP ENTER INTO A STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Las Vegas, NV January 8, 2000 - Amiga begins expressing plans for the new Amiga
with a strategic alliance with Tao-Group.

"Things started going wrong the moment the PC rode into town and the home
computer revolution of the 1980s ground to a halt. We are here to right that
wrong." said Bill McEwen, Amiga's El Presidente. 'We kind of feel guilty about
not having been around to show the world the evils of the PC, but inept
management sent the Amiga off to a bad place. Luckily, its users and developers
have kept it alive, and now we are back."

"Existing products are very rude.' He continued. "Shoving PCI slots, interrupts,
file systems, registries, megahertz, and megabytes right into your face. My
grandmother just wants to play a game, or send an email, or draw a picture. She
doesn't want to have to mortgage the house and get a masters degree."

"Digital Technology has become stalled because of the predominance of Windows."
quiped in Fleecy Moss. "Putting a thousand monkeys on typewriters may eventually
produce the works of Shakespeare but it's not something you're going to want to
wait around for, and you don't want to be responsible for cleaning up the mess
in the meantime."

"Our approach is outrageous. WE look at what actual people want, and then give
them the most simple, elegant solution. Even calling it computing is falling
into the PC trap. It is participation in the digital content universe, whether
it be developing an application, playing a game, making your own video, watching
TV or buying S&M gear online. Computing companies are trying to paint digital
convergence as computers and TVs coming together, so they can stick "TV" in
front of PC and continue to sell the same old garbage. Digital Convergence is
something much bigger though. It is about content, information, services, and
activity transforming into a digital format and coming together in a single
place that has no boundaries. If someone tells you you need a PC to get into
this new content universe, smile nicely and hit them with a big stick."

"Elegance, simplicity, invisible and universal technology." sings Bill McEwen,
trying to get a word in edgeways. "That is why we are just giddy to be working
with the Tao Group. Others rant on about how their products are next generation,
warp capable, but the truth is that most of them are based upon old concepts and
architectures - that's why you need the latest monster machine just to type
letters. Chris Hinsley (CTO/Tao Group) was one of those smartass child prodigies
you wanted to beat up at school. By age 20, he had already been a commercial
games developer for 5 years, and wrote some great Amiga games. Being a smartass
though, he saw the future, realised nothing out there was ready for it, and
dedicated the last ten years of his life to making sure the human race was ready
when the future arrived."

"The Amiga was special because it refused to settle for second best. If
something is worth doing, it is worth doing right, and the proof of that is in
the global following that it still has today. With the nightmare of the past
five years behind us, the Amiga is ready to push out ahead again, and save the
future from a muddled, poorly fitting, frustrating PC enema. With the foundation
that the Tao Group gives us, we are ready to re-introduce the world to a novel
computer concept - fun."

"We aren't stupid enough to think it's going to be easy," interrupts Fleecy
Moss, shoving McEwen to the ground and gagging him. "A lot of people have been
brainwashed by the advertisements and the slick salespeople. However, the
digital information revolution is all around us, waiting to happen. Everyone can
feel it, everyone wants to be a part of it. Amiga is going to stick a pretty big
bomb under that PC logjam and blow it clean back to Redmond. Elegance,
simplicity, invisible and universal technology. Time to start smiling again."

"We are happier than a crocodile at a waterpark to be working with Amiga." said
Francis Charig, CEO and international stud. "We are very proud of what we have
created in our garden shed. We could have sold out long ago, but the market was
crowded with companies doing that so we decided to actual create a product and
make it a good one. Now we are finding that OEMs are seeing our product and
getting even more excited about it than we are ourselves; it almost makes the
whipping and torture we have had to inflict on our employees worthwhile. An
Amiga solution powered by Tao technology is a match made in heaven for
everyone."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi!

KOSH troubles

We're having server problems again.

http://www.iconimaging.net/kosh/ is currently down, as are mailing lists. We're
working to try and rectify this situation, but there's nothing we can do about
it right now.

http://kosh.convergence.org/ is still live. Mailing lists will be up again
somewhere ASAP - it would be helpful if subscribers could get in touch in case
we can't get hold of a list. If anyone wants to know anything can they mail me
(greg@kosh.convergence.org) and I'll try and answer any questions.

Thanks,

Greg

We all know there's no such thing as an input device that lends itself equally
well to every application. Which is why you need Graphire. Its winning mouse and
pen combination means you always have the right tool at hand. Graphire is the
all-round solution, from Web-browsing to retouching, from illustration to
Office. Switch on to the benefits of the unique Graphire set - for precise
pointing and clicking, for intuitive drawing, for sketching and writing.

Finally Amiga fans can use the new graphics tablet. The driver supports the
pressure sensitive pen as well as the enclosed wireless mouse and the
finger-wheel.

The "Graphire" can be used with any Amiga computer with external keyboard (PS/2
connectors). Unfortunately all Amiga models besides A4000 Desktop were delivered
with normal DIN connectors you might need an additional adapter set.

           DIRECTORY OPUS 4.12 SOURCE CODE RELEASED UNDER GPL LICENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory Opus 4 is hereby released as free software under the GNU GENERAL
PUBLIC LICENSE. Please READ this license and make sure you understand the terms
and conditions of this license.

The release of Directory Opus 4 under the GPL in NO WAY affects the existing
commercial status of Directory Opus 5 or subsequent products. Nor does it affect
the GPSoftware trademarks of DirectoryOpus, DOpus, Opus and related terms. These

price. Please see http://www.gpsoft.com.au/ for more information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory Opus 4 (the last commercial release was 4.12) was compiled under SAS/C
5. I have modified the source code before release to enable it to be compiled
under SAS/C 6. Compilation with other compilers is certainly possible, but it is
left to the individual to make any changes necessary.

The source code is large uncommented, messy, spaghettified, and generally in bad
shape. I sincerely recommend you consider upgrading to Directory Opus 5, the
source code of which is _much_ better :)

However, for those of you who still seem stuck on version 4, I hope this GPL
release will prove useful.

Please read the GPL and you can find the link to the archive at the bottom of
this page. Have fun.

@node not14 "DARKAGE SOFTWARE ANNOUNCES TWO NEW TITLES"
                   DARKAGE SOFTWARE ANNOUNCES TWO NEW TITLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Darkage Software have announced two new titles which will be released very soon.

The first one is Powerball, a simple puzzle game where the player must clean
each screen from all the coloured bricks. Doing this is possible by using a ball
that bounces up and down in the screen and that can be controlled by the player
who can move it left or right.

The ball cleans all the same-coloured bricks; to change its colour it has to
touch a brick with two crossed arrows indicating a ball. Other bricks that the
ball can meet are those which are painted with a skull (to avoid, because they
cause the loss of a life), those which can be moved (but not cleaned)
represented by a four-head arrow and those which allow the ball to be teleported
between two points.

Obviously, difficult grows up going on through the levels which compose the game
and examining each screen before starting action could be useful. But you have
to take care of the time limit in each level; running out of time will cause the
loss of a life.

During game, you can collect several bonuses which can increase points or lives,
make you jump to the next level etc. They appear for a few seconds as a brick on
the screen.

The game features:

   - 80 levels in 8 worlds
   - Runs also on an A500!
   - Level editor to add your own levels
   - Only one floppy disk, but it's also hard disk installable!
   - A password system to save your position
   - Loads of fun included in the package! :)

The game will run on any Amiga with 1Mb Ram, and it will available on floppy
disk. The game is scheduled to be released in March 2000. You can download a
demo from http://www.idealia.net/darkage/PowerballDemo.lha

The second title is Amiga Classix 2, the official sequel to one of the most
succesfull Amiga compilation ever! Produced exclusively for Epic Marketing ltd.

It will feature full commercial games by:

   - Darren Ithell (Dithell In Space)
   - Dark Unicorn Productions (Scorched Tanks)
   - Diamond Production (Diamond Caves, Diamond Caves 2, Maniac Ball, Master
     Blaster)
   - Digital Concepts (Island of lost hope, Lords of War, Torch2081)
   - Eclipse Software (Lethal Xcess, Monster Business)
   - Frank Otto (Lost on Parrot Island)
   - Hitek Softworks (Barravento)
   - MegArts (Bomb Mania)
   - Mental Image (Bandit Mania, Technology 2, Winning Post)
   - Scorpius Software (Antz, Blade, Hilt, Hilt 2, Hideous)
   - StarByte (Tiebreak, Hannibal, Space Max, Aunt Artic Adventure, Charon V)
   - Team Hoi (Hoi Aga Remix)
   - and the very famous game Ports of Call!

It will be suitable for both Amiga and PC (you can play all games directly from
the cd, no installation required!). It will run on an Amiga AGA, it will be
CD-Rom only and it will be released in February 2000.

On the other hand, Tales from Heaven have now reached the shops, and Darkage
Software has a big surprise! They have modified the price, reducing it of more
than 10%! Now it costs 79.000 italian lire (40,80Eur). Of course all the people
who preordered from Darkage, they will pay the new price!

The game has 12 levels in 3 worlds, and the production is made with a silver cd
(no gold copies).

@node not13 "PAYBACK STATUS REPORT: PART VII"
                        PAYBACK STATUS REPORT: PART VII
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16 January 2000 - The News

It's been a while since the last status report, but that's given me more time to
work on the game, which is starting to get dangerously addictive! This has
frequently slowed down development; several times I've ended up playing the game
for an hour or more rather than actually adding new features! Even so, the
following improvements have been added to the game since last month:

   - Cars now beep at you if you get in their way. Not only that, but some
     drivers are more aggressive than others, which effects all aspects of
     their driving.
   - Police cars now have sirens, complete with flashing lights! (With lens
     flares, of course!)
   - I've started to design more of the map - there's a lot more to explore than
     there was before.
   - More scripting features have been added - garages work properly and you get
     messages sent to you when you do certain things.
   - I fixed a rather major bug that allowed cars to drive up walls. D'oh!
   - Collisions with 'scenery objects' (trees, lampposts, crates, things like
     that) now work brilliantly.
   - The player no longer restarts in the same place every time, which adds a
     bit more variety to the gameplay.
   - Full multi-language support has been added.
   - I added a progress bar to the loading screen.
   - The audio system can now cope with up to 500 sounds at once, which is
     rather more than the previous limit of 100. You might think that this
     would slow the game down, but improvements in efficiency mean that it's
     actually slightly faster than the old system!

Anyway, that's it for this time. Look forward to seeing you next update!
