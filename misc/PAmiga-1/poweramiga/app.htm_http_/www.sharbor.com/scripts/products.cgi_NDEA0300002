<H2>ALADDIN 4D V5.0 - NOVA DESIGN LTD.</H2>
Eski bir raytrace programýnýn yýllar sonra yeni bir sürümünün çýkmasý gerçekten Amiga`nýn
Avrupa ve Amerika`daki durumunun ne kadar iyiye doðru gittiðini gösteriyor.(Türkiye`de durum
pek karanlýk gözüküyor ne yazýk ki).<P>
Aladdin4D`nin eski sürümleri oldukça kullanýþsýz idi ancak Cinema4D V3.0`ýn standart Amiga
pencerelerini kullanmasýndan sonra diðer raytace programlarý da bu yolu izlemeye baþladý.
<P>
Aladdin 4D V5.0`ýn Özellikleri þöyle:

Paths also control rotation, scaling, mechanical waves, deforms and instancing, and can be linked for easy complex motion. Timeline and keyframe animation techniques are supported. Control splines can be used to control all aspects of transition.<b><p>Shading</b> can be facet, Gouraud or Phong. Other attributes are timelined so objects can change reflectivity, color, reflective color, transparency, hardness, etc. during the ani
ation, all under spline control.<b><p>Textures</b>. The most complete and easy to use texturing system available allows you to composite any number of bitmaps and/or procedural textures and specify when each should occur along with the strength and effect, including normal, bump, opacity, illumination, genlock and more. Procedural and bitmap sequences are supported.<b><p>Transitions</b> between effects are unlimited and easy to perform.<b><p>Lights</b> are unlimited in number and use attribute lists so they can change color and strength during the animation as well as being assigned to paths. They can also cast shadows and create highlights independently.<b><p>Wave Sources</b> are unlimited in number and have dual radii making it easy to imitate rings in water, etc.<b><p>Shadows</b> are created using user optimizable ray tracing algorithms. Other rendering is achieved through solid- model algorithms for greater speed and efficiency.<b><p>Gaseous Objects</b> are easy to use. A containe
 is presented in which the actual density of space can be modified. Gases use attribute and texture lists as well as turbulence settings for dramatic effects.<b><p>Fountain Particle System</b> allows the creation of endless varieties of particle effects, from fireworks to smoke trails to falling snow.<b><p>Lens Flares</b> are 3D objects tied to or independent of lights! They are so flexible that a lens flare is only one of the uses you will find for this unique implementation.<b><p>Camera</b> <b>can use one or more targets</b> which control zoom, tilt and direction and even pan from one target to the next, all under spline control.<b><p>And Much More</b>, like loading encapsulated Postscript files from work drawn in a traditional drawing program. Backgrounds, foregrounds and overlays are supported. Direct support of DCTV, Retina, Firecracker, OpalVision and standard Amiga modes including HAM8, 24-bit IFF and more.<u><p>Requirements:</u><br>68020 CPU or higher<br>68881 floating-point m
th co-processor<br>4MB of memory<br>10MB of available hard drive space<br>AmigaDOS 2.1 or higher<u><p>Recommended for best results</u><br>68040 or 68060 accelerator<br>16MB of memory<br>Large hard drive<p><hr size=1 noshade><font size=+1><b>What customers say:</b></font><br><blockquote><p><b>A customer from Baltimore, MD on 09/26/1997, rating=9:<br>Aladdin is a very comprehensive choice for 3D/animation.</b><br>I've used Aladdin in the past and my anticipation of the new version has paid off.  The list of  options and user controls is very long but it  doesn't take long to find your way around.  As 3D  applications go, it is fast and manages to deliver an array of tools that I haven't seen in other  packages.<p>Power and economy make Aladdin a very good choice for the beginner or advanced artist/animator.</blockquote>
