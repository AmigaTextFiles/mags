TACTICAL FIGHTER EXPERIMENT  
  
So you want to fly?  You want to REALLY fly?  Well you made the  
right choice with TFX... Take total control of one of three of  
the finest aircraft money can't buy: the Eurofighter 2000, the  
Lockheed F-22 Superstar and the Lockheed F-117A Stealth Fighter.  
  
Puncture the clouds and marvel at the view of the world below.   
Feel the intense thrill of flying low, hard and fast over cities  
and rolling hills, through a hail of triple-A illuminating the  
night sky and swarms of hostile fighters.  
  
So you want to fight?  In TFX there are entir countries ready to  
take you on.  Fly to South America for crack combat with powerful  
drug barons.  Succeed where so many other have failed in putting  
a halt to the horror of the Bosnian conflict.  Free the world  
from oppression and earn medals and honors into the bargain.    
  
Even when you manage to make the TFX world a safe place in which  
to live, you can always construct  your own devilish missions to  
amuse yourself.  
  
But above all: keep the peace.  
  
INTRODUCTION  
TFX is a computer game, but it is also a flight simulator. While  
it can be played on a simple level as an action game, it also has  
a complex flight modeling system which attempts to reproduce many  
aspects of flight and of the airplanes you will be piloting. If  
you have played flight simulators before, you will be familiar  
with much of what this manual describes. While some flight games  
have little realism, but impressive graphics and plenty of  
action, some contain much military and aerodynamic detail to  
reproduce many of the challenges that face a real pilot in a  
combat situation. In TFX, we have tried to do both. You will know  
already how advanced the graphics system is, but the flight model  
has many details never before seen on a home computer simulator.  
  
Some simulations are based on current or past aircraft, and the  
writers are able to research aspects of cockpit detail, military  
procedure and flight behavior by reading books and obtaining  
information from the manufacturers. However, with the three  
airplanes you will fly in TFX, this was not possible. Of the  
three, only the F-117A is in service at the time of writing, and  
even it still has many closely guarded secrets. The Eurofighter  
2000 and the F-22 Superstar will enter service with the air  
forces of western Europe and the USA respectively in the late  
1990s, although prototypes and technology demonstrator airplanes  
have been tested for them.  
  
For this reason, aerodynamic data could not be plucked from books  
or from technical reports. Test data from the Experimental  
Aircraft Programme (EAP) and YF-22 prototype were available, but  
much of the data required was calculated from basic aerodynamic  
methods. Wing shape, body wetted area and other characteristics  
were used to make estimates of the airplanes' lift, drag and  
other aerodynamic performance parameters. Luckily, these  
calculations corroborated quite well with the published data.  
Some published data turned out to be inaccurate, when judgements  
had to be made between conflicting sources of information. On  
some factors, no information was available. Then, I had to make  
educated guesses based on similar airplanes and common sense  
requirements.  
  
Essentially, TFX is a speculative simulation of the cutting edge  
of aerial warfare. It is, in the end, entertainment, but I hope,  
for the research and effort put into the model, it is  
entertainment of a positive and rewarding nature.

SECTION ONE  
  
GETTING STARTED  
  
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  
  
TFX is highly compressed on the program disks and remains highly  
compressed once installed on the hard disk, taking up 12 MB of  
space instead of 40 MB. All data is decompressed in real time.  
Normal compression programs will not be able to compress it  
further.  
  
TFX requires a 386 or 486 IBM PC compatible with either 4 MB of  
extended memory or 4 MB of extra disk space if the RAM is not  
present. RAM is used wherever possible, but it is not necessary.  
Virtual Memory. TFX will run from a Superstore drive or any form  
of compression software, e.i., Stacker and DoubleSpace. However,  
it must be noted that compression software may cause installation  
to fail because the program assumes there is sufficient free hard  
disk space.  
  
The more disk space and machine RAM available, the faster TFX  
will run.  
  
SECTION TWO  
  
TFX CONFIGURATION  
  
Until you become comfortable with TFX's level of realism, we  
recommend you select 'EASY' settings (or equivalents), to get  
into the swing of things. As your confidence grows you can make  
life more difficult for yourself and learn how to really fly by  
bumping up the settings.  To return to TFX Configuration menu,  
press the "accent" key.   
  
FLIGHT CONTROLS    
Choose from 'JOYSTICK', 'MOUSE' or 'KEYBOARD' to control the  
basic flight of the aircraft. Note that the mouse is always used  
for the selection of options.  
  
WORLD DETAIL    
There are three levels: 'LOW', 'MEDIUM' or 'HIGH'. The lower the  
level of detail, the faster TFX runs.  
  
FLIGHT MODEL    
You decide the level of realism of the flight model and  
consequently the effect of forces on the aircraft and its  
handling. Choose from 'ARCADE', 'SIMPLE', 'REALISTIC' and  
'MILITARY SPEC'. The choice depends on your confidence and  
ability.  
  
ARCADE    
Flight models don't come much simpler than this ... You can defy  
the laws of physics and have a ball. You can fly at ridiculous  
speeds but cannot stall or crash      and you won't be affected  
by extreme turns.  
  
SIMPLE   
A little more complicated than the Arcade flight model.  
  
REALISTIC    
Very, but the aircraft are still simple enough to fly as the  
onboard computers take care of most of the hard work, leaving you  
to enjoy the flight - and combat, of course.  
  
MILITARY SPEC    
The creme de la creme of flight models. There has never - repeat,  
never - been a flight model as authentic as this for the home  
computer. Note that when using the Military Specification flight  
model, additions are made to the HUD, the MFDs, and more besides  
(further details are found in the relevant sections).  
  
SOUND FX    
The noises made during play may be turned 'ON' or 'OFF'. If  
possible, leave the sound effects on - they can help enormously  
(especially the speech).  
  
MUSIC    
Turn 'ON' or 'OFF' all the atmospheric music.  
  
QUIT TO DOS    
The same effect may be achieved during play as follows:          
          
  Press and hold the left-hand shift key then press the Q key to  
pull up an options screen where you can quit to DOS or quit to  
the enroll screen.  If you quit to the enroll screen, it will not  
affect your log (as if you have never played the mission)  
  Press and hold the left-hand shift key then press the Q key  
again to return to DOS.  
  
REALISM MENU    
More advanced options. See below for further details.  
  
REALISM MENU  
  
G EFFECTS    
The force of gravity can have unpleasant side-effects on pilots  
in flight (see G-FORCE on page 36). Choose from 'NONE', 'REDUCED'  
or 'REALISTIC' to determine the extent of redout or blackout when  
pulling high g's.  
  
LOSS OF CONTROL    
Choose from 'NONE', 'PARTIAL' or 'ALL' to determine the extent of  
control loss in extreme circumstances in flight.  
  
CRASHING    
Select 'ON' to ensure that ground crashes destroy your aircraft.  
  
GEAR DAMAGE    
Select 'ON' to ensure that rough landings and high airspeeds  
damage your landing gear.  
  
WIND    
Select 'ON' to activate the effects of wind when using the  
Military Specification flight model. See WEATHER CONDITIONS  
overleaf for further details.  
  
TEMPERATURE    
Affects the aerodynamic characteristics of the air. When this  
option is 'ON', the temperature will vary with geographic area,  
weather conditions and time of day. See WEATHER CONDITIONS  
overleaf for further details.  
  
PRECIPITATION    
Mainly affects runway quality, in that a wet runway can lengthen  
takeoff distance. Select 'ON' to ensure that rain or snow will  
fall and cause problems.  
  
WEATHER CONDITIONS  
  
Note that these only affect the aircraft when using the Military  
Specification flight model.  
  
Wind conditions vary with geographic area, weather and altitude.  
Obviously, wind will be very high in a storm, but higher winds  
will be experienced in the South Atlantic than in Italy.  
Additionally, TFX models the high altitude gulf stream patterns  
which are created by the Earth's rotation. In each world area,  
these are treated as 100-140 knot winds which occur in the  
stratosphere (above about 30,000 ft) and are roughly constant in  
direction and magnitude.  
  
Bear in mind that temperatures are higher in hotter countries.  
That said, African nights are very cold, whereas in Colombia,  
clouds trap the heat, and there is less variation in temperature.  
  
SECTION THREE  
  
TO BEGIN...  
An introductory sequence sets the scene.  
  
  Press the Esc key to skip the introductory sequence. Once the  
introductory sequence and credits have been shown you will be  
presented with two options: 'CREATE NEW PILOT' (highlighted in  
red) and 'LOAD PREVIOUS GAME'. Use the arrow (cursor) keys to  
move the red highlight between the options.  
  
  Press the Enter key to select the highlighted option.  
  
  Press the Accent key to return to configuration menu.  
  
CREATE NEW PILOT  
When you are prompted to enter your first name, your surname and  
your callsign, use the keyboard to type any combination of  
letters and numbers up to a maximum of 20 characters. The default  
name and callsign are DIRK INFERNO and LOOSE CANNON.  
  
  Press the Enter key to register your name and callsign.Your  
name and callsign are used to personalize your pilot's log which  
is saved to one of 10 'slots' on the hard disk. The pilot's log  
records your performance in play (note: Arcade and Simulator  
excepted), retaining such statistics as the number of enemy kills  
you make, the number of missions you complete, your score, rank  
and flight time. Use the arrow (cursor) keys to highlight one of  
the slots and view further details at the bottom of the screen.  
  
  Press the Enter key to select the highlighted slot. Note that  
if you select a dead pilot's log or a blank slot, you will have  
to enter fresh details.  
  
MAIN OPTIONS SCREEN  
Having picked a pilot's log you are presented with the Main  
Options Screen. Further options - to tailor the TFX environment  
to your taste - are available during play (see section 2: TFX  
CONFIGURATION on page 2). All options are now selected with  
mouse-controlled pointers. Simply move the mouse-pointer's tip to  
touch the desired option and press the left-hand mouse button to  
select it.  
  
There are six key ways to play TFX - from simple arcade-style  
action to hard-core real-world combat simulations. You can even  
build your own missions with the UN Commander option. Note that  
when you become involved with the Training, Flashpoints or Tour  
Of Duty options, you are susceptible to all rules and regulations  
and run the risk of Court Martial, capture and more ...  
  
Almost every man-made object in the TFX environment is worth  
points. You score points for every authorized enemy target you  
destroy. However, as a UN peace envoy, you are not expected to  
fly around blowing up all and sundry. Unless you wish to incur  
the wrath of the media and the UN Command, do not fire unless  
fired upon - or you have been given specific permission to take  
out hostile targets. Your score is reduced significantly should  
you decide to attack anything other than a 'legitimate' target.  
Hospitals and churches, for example, are best left alone as the  
penalties for their destruction are severe, particularly in  
Training, Flashpoints and Tour Of Duty situations.  
  
Points are also awarded for classy flying - especially in  
dangerous weather conditions. Basically, the greater your display  
of skill, the more points you score.  
  
As missions are completed, your rank increases and special awards  
may be given. In TFX you start as a Second Lieutenant. With skill  
(and a little luck) you should (ahem) fly through the ranks of  
First Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel  
to become a General.  
  
ENROLL TO UNAF  
Select this to create a new pilot's log or load a previously  
created one.  
  
ARCADE  
To get a feel for TFX, there's no better place to start than  
here.  
  
There are no takeoffs and landings to worry about, and it doesn't  
matter if you somehow manage to live or die or lose your aircraft  
(it's impossible to crash it, but you may be blown away) - you  
can always start again and attempt to improve your score.  
  
The Arcade option comprises five levels of increasing difficulty.  
Each level represents a unique environment with different  
terrain, times of day, weather conditions, and levels of enemy  
competence (from a handful of amateur MiG-21 pilots to squadrons  
of veteran MiG-29 pilots). You also get to knock out ground  
targets including factories, SAM radar sites and air bases.  
  
Note that your aircraft is automatically armed. The weapon  
selection depends on your choice of aircraft (the F-117A cannot  
be flown here). Chaff and decoy flares are in restricted supply,  
but you do get unlimited ammunition and fuel to play with.  
  
TRAINING  
There's only one way to become involved with the deep and  
meaningful Flashpoints and Tour Of Duty campaigns, and that's to  
undertake and complete a carefully considered selection of  
training missions. No, that's not entirely true: there is another  
way to prove yourself worthy, but that's for you to discover ...  
  
The 10 Training missions are designed to help familiarize you  
with all aspects of TFX. You will fly all three aircraft through  
a broad spectrum of combat situations. The choice of weaponry is  
yours. Where you fly from - in the air or on a land- or aircraft  
carrier-based runway - depends on the mission in question.  
  
SIMULATOR  
Fly the way you want to with no rules or regulations to hold you  
back.  
With the Simulator there are no points to win or lose, no awards  
to earn, and no threats of court martial ... This is  
unadulterated flight and fight simulation at its best.  
  
You choose the location, the weather conditions and the time of  
day to determine the aircraft you will control and from where you  
will fly it: in the air or a land- or carrier-based runway. You  
also get to arm the aircraft with whatever weaponry it can take  
(see ARMING YOUR AIRCRAFT on page 35), but choose wisely:  
consider what would be appropriate for your previously selected  
specifications.  
  
TOUR OF DUTY  
Enroll to one of three squadrons - the F-22 Superstars, the F-117  
Darkstars or the EF-2000 Blue Angels - and become involved in  
their actions around the world. But this is more than a glorified  
world tour ...  
  
The theater of operations will become apparent when the time is  
right. A full brief of the situation at hand will be given along  
with a map of the area in which the mission takes place.  
  
  Press the Space Bar to step through a numbered breakdown of the  
mission.  
  
  Press the right-hand mouse button to skip the mission briefing.  
  
Now arm your aircraft. Where you fly from - in the air or on a  
land- or aircraft carrier-based runway - depends on the mission  
in question.  
  
FLASH POINTS  
Five true-to-life storylines with a mission structure - an  
interactive soap opera, if you will. The way you play will change  
the course of history, for better or worse. Pick a scenario, any  
scenario. Now pay close attention to the news reports, press  
conferences, UN Assembly crisis meetings and orders from the top  
brass as the story's background unfolds and the scene is set  
before your very eyes ...  
  
  Press the left-hand mouse button to skip any stage of the  
background information.  
  
  Press the spacebar or the Esc key to move on to the next  
mission.  
  
An aircraft and weaponry suitable to the mission at hand will be  
chosen for you. All you have to do is complete the missions ...  
  
UN COMMANDER  
Build your own missions with ease from the comfort of UN Central  
Command. It wouldn't be wise to fly an F-117A Stealth Bomber over  
a hostile terrain, in the middle of the day, for all to see, and  
here's where you can find out why ...  
  
Choose anywhere in the TFX world and use satellite imagery to  
scan the area. Select your targets, determine the time of day,  
the weather conditions, the quantity and quality of threats and  
more besides.  
  
Pick an aircraft, arm it and then attempt to score as many points  
as possible and see if you can beat yourself at your own game.  
You can even save the missions to hard disk and then copy them to  
floppy disk to swap with your pals.  
  
For further details, see BUILDING A MISSION on page 42.  
  
SECTION FOUR  
  
THE COCKPIT  
  
Although some functions and instruments vary slightly between the  
three aircraft flown in TFX, the same generic cockpit is used  
throughout. In general, the cockpit utilizes the latest in Multi- 
Function Display technology for clear and concise information  
flow.  
  
When designing a multi-billion dollar super jet, a great deal of  
time and effort is spent to house the pilot in a comfortable,  
electronic environment not congested with hundreds of individual  
unimportant instruments such as cigar lighters. The instruments  
show exactly what the pilot needs to know at any one given time.    
For example, designers made it possible for the Eurofighter 2000  
pilot to concentrate on hostile threats and potential danger and  
not have to worry about flying the aircraft.  
  
Within the cockpit the displays are arranged in appropriate  
functional groups including engines and other related systems (on  
the far left-hand side), electronic counter measures and  
avoidance systems (on the far right-hand side), and vital  
warnings for incoming missiles, onboard faults and so on (the top  
section).  
  
The cockpit has a simple color coding system for the information  
displayed:  
  
GREEN    
The system is active and functional  
  
YELLOW    
Caution! The system has sustained slight damage  
  
RED    
The system is damaged beyond repair  
  
ENGINE MANAGEMENT AND FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEMS  
  
AUTO PILOT FUNCTION LIGHT    
Shows that the auto pilot is active. The number displayed next to  
the light shows the mode. For further details, see THE AUTO  
PILOT.  
  
24-HOUR CLOCK   
Shows the time expired or the local time of day.  
the cockpit (cont.)  
  
ENGINE IGNITION LIGHTS    
One for each engine. An engine is shut down when its light is  
red. Ignition has been achieved when the light is green. Note  
that if either light flashes or turns red, the engine is damaged  
and may shut down.  
  
FUEL GAUGE    
Shows the amount of remaining fuel in pounds. A yellow caution  
light means that less than 500 lbs of fuel remains. A red warning  
light and a message on the HUD means that the fuel level has  
fallen to a dangerous level - below 200 lbs.  
  
RPM GAUGE    
Shows the amount of engine thrust being applied. The RPM should  
not drop below 60 per cent while in flight. When afterburners  
have been activated, the RPM will be at 100 per cent.  
  
AFTERBURNER STAGE LIGHTS    
One for each increase in power (beware that afterburners consume  
vast amounts of fuel). Note that the F-117 does not have any  
afterburners.  
  
INDICATOR PANEL  
  
STALL INDICATOR    
The light flashes when the aircraft is approaching a stall and  
stays on when the aircraft has stalled (it may be accompanied by  
an audio warning). To recover from a stall, increase your  
throttle and push the aircraft's nose down - or hit the Panic

BASIC HUD INFORMATION  
  
AoA INDEXER    
A fixed display showing the aircraft's angle of attack on  
approach to the runway for landing. The following lights provide  
specific information regarding your AoA:  
  
TOP    
Your AoA is too high because your airspeed is too low.  
  
MIDDLE    
Your AoA is good for landing.  
  
BOTTOM    
Your AoA is too low because your airspeed is too high.  
  
UNDERCARRIAGE DISPLAY    
The bottom light comes on when your aircraft's undercarriage is  
on the ground. The top light (NW) informs you that steering is  
now performed by the nose wheel of the aircraft so that the  
aircraft can taxi and manoeuvre on the runway.  
  
THE MAP  
The overview of your theater of operations is not shown on the  
cockpit but is always accessible. Information on any hostile  
aircraft your radar is currently tracking is shown on the right- 
hand side of the map. Your systems can track up to 10 hostile  
aircraft at once.  
  
  Press the M key to call up the Map.

SYSTEMS DISPLAY    
Provides current flight details including  RPM, speed, altitude,  
fuel and possible range with the present fuel load.  
  
WEAPONS DISPLAY    
A diagrammatic overview of the aircraft's pylons and any weapons  
on them. Also shown is the type of each weapon, and which weapons  
are armed.  
  
FORWARD LOOKING INFRARED VIEW    
The FLIR shows a forward view through your laser target  
designator when it is not yet locked on to any ground-based  
object. When you lock on an object the display will automatically  
change to the DLIR.  
  
DOWNWARD LOOKING INFRARED VIEW    
The DLIR shows the target locked on to by the laser designator.  
For further details see USING THE LASER TARGET DESIGNATOR on page  
38.  
  
GROUND TARGET DATA BANK    
Shows your target and its distance from your present point in an  
air-to-ground mission.  
  
  Press the N key to switch between target views.  
  
MULTI-FUNCTION DISPLAY RADARS  
  
Press 2 key to cycle through MFD2  
  
The TFX aircraft are fitted with the latest Westinghouse multi- 
role radar with variable scan and track modes including air-to- 
air and air-to-ground, and a map display. The symbology remains  
the same in all modes.  
  
Activating the radars will break Stealth mode if it is  
operational, so don't activate your radars if you wish to remain  
invisible to enemy radar. The only 'safe' radar is the moving map  
display which uses a passive radar system which does not scan and  
emit any signal - it only receives information.  
  
AIR-TO-AIR RADAR SYMBOLOGY  
  
RED DOT    
Hostile aircraft  
  
RED SQUARE   
Hostile aircraft you are currently tracking  
  
GREEN DOT    
Friendly aircraft  
  
RED FLASHING DIAMOND    
An airborne missile  
  
YELLOW FLASHING DIAMOND    
Friendly missile  
  
AIR-TO-GROUND RADAR SYMBOLOGY  
  
RED DOT    
Hostile mobile surface target, e.g., a ship or tank  
  
RED FLASHING DIAMOND    
Airborne missile  
  
RED FLASHING DOT    
SAM radar  
  
BLUE DOT    
Friendly surface craft, e.g., a ship or tank  
  
HORIZONTAL SITUATION RADAR    
Provides a 360 degree horizontal scan up to a radius of 50 miles  
around your aircraft. It is     common for close formations of  
aircraft to appear as a single 'trace' or dot, which is where the  
variable range search comes into effect ... Switch between a  
radius of 50 miles, 30 miles 10 miles and 2 miles (the range is  
shown in the bottom right-hand corner of the display). Note that  
the radar only shows relevant data when the aircraft is in either  
air-to-air or air-to-ground mode.  
  
BEYOND VISUAL RANGE RADAR    
BVR radar is used for long range scans and to target long range  
air-to-air missiles. A narrow   beam can scan up to 120 miles  
(180 miles if the area is clutter-free - for example, the ocean).  
The BVR radar can determine whether an aircraft is hostile but  
the immense distance means that precise tracking data will not be  
given.  
  
MOVING MAP DISPLAY (MMD)  A digitally-generated map which moves  
relative to your aircraft in the center of the display. A white  
line indicates your aircraft's direction, and its heading is  
given. The MMD also shows authorized ground targets (flashing red  
and white) and airborne radar traces of any aircraft relevant to  
your location. A full map of your theater of operation is always  
available.  
  
CONTROL MFD  
Displays information regarding the in-flight control of your  
aircraft. In an F-22 or Eurofighter, the mission adaptive wing  
indicator in the top right-hand corner shows a schematic  
representation of the wing cross-section. A short line on the  
left-hand side of the Control MFD shows the angle of deflection  
of the leading edge flaps or slats (although in fact slats move  
in a more complex way). A longer line on the right-hand side  
shows deflection of the trailing edge flaps. The greater the  
downward deflection of the flaps, the more lift they produce.  
Normally the flaps are automatically adjusted in flight according  
to the aircraft's needs, but if the flaps become damaged, they  
may lock in position.  
  
In an F-22, thrust vectoring angles are indicated in the top  
left-hand corner of the Control MFD. The maximum deflection is 20  
degrees up or down.  
  
Control mode information is shown below these displays. The  
sensitivity of the aerodynamic controls is automatically adjusted  
to suit your situation. The modes are as follows:  
  
CRUISE    
Medium sensitivity - the normal mode  
  
COMBAT    
Highly sensitive - for air-to-air combat  
  
LANDING    
Insensitive - for a steady landing  
  
AUTO    
Auto pilot  
  
Note that when the auto pilot is activated, further information  
is displayed. See THE AUTO PILOT on page 25 for more details.  
  
THE HEAD-UP DISPLAY UNIT (INCLUDING HELMET MOUNTED HUD)  
  
The Head-Up Display provides important data for the pilot during  
all aspects of flight. It is the most important instrument you  
will use in TFX. The helmet-mounted HUD comes into effect when  
the cockpit is not shown, for example, when using the full  
forward view.  
  
The HUD has three main modes as follows:  
  
* NAVIGATION MODE  
  
* AIR-TO-AIR MODE  
  
* AIR-TO-GROUND MODE  
  
It also has two sub-modes: INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM and REFUEL.  
  
To adjust the intensity of the HUD color to a comfortable  
setting, use the "y" key to decrease and the "u" key to increase.  
  
Note that when using the Military Specification flight model, the  
HUD displays extra information: an Angle of Attack indexer, a  
Vertical Speed Indicator and Mach number (see page 24).  
  
NAVIGATION HUD MODE  
  
A non-combat flight mode which provides both air-to-air or air- 
to-ground radar capability and a cruise control flight model.  
Note that the cannon becomes the only available weapon.  
  
 Press the right hand Control key to select the navigation mode  
HUD.  
  
 Press Enter to return to Radar.  
  
Certain details are common to all HUD modes as follows:  
  
AIRSPEED    
In knots. Mach speed is also shown with the Military  
Specification flight model.  
  
ALTITUDE   
 In feet, from sea level.  
  
ENGINE THRUST    
Shows the percentage of thrust applied by your engines.  
  
G-FORCE    
The current gravity force upon you and your aircraft. The g-force  
indicator will read '1G' when your aircraft is flying level or is  
stationary. For further details see             G-FORCE on page  
28.  
  
HEADING    
In units of 10 degrees. North is at 0 degrees, East is at 90  
degrees, South is at 180 degrees and West is at 270 degrees.  
  
MAP CO-ORDINATES    
Your current location in the world on a grid reference of 0 to  
200 along X and Y axes. The center of the theater of operations  
is 100, 100. The farthest Southwest point is 0, 0, and the  
farthest Northeast point is 200, 200.  
  
WEAPON TYPE    
The available weapon depends on the HUD mode.  
  
PITCH LADDER    
A series of lines which move, relative to your aircraft's motion,  
through the center of the HUD. The Pitch Ladder bars show your  
aircraft's angle of climb and dive, and its roll angle. The  
center Ladder Bar at 0 degrees is horizontal - to reflect the  
aircraft's status. The steeper the aircraft's angle of climb or  
dive, the more acutely triangular the shape of the Ladder Bars.  
  
HUD MODE    
Shows the HUD mode in use. The HUD symbology changes and relevant  
weapons become available. For further details, see the sections  
that follow.  
  
NAV    
Navigation mode  
  
AA    
Air-to-Air mode  
  
AG    
Air-to-Ground mode  
  
ILS    
Instrument Landing System mode  
  
AIR-TO-AIR HUD MODE  
When this mode is chosen, the air-to-air radar is activated, the  
flight model is adjusted to a more appropriate air-to-air combat  
profile, and air-to-air missiles can be launched.       
  
The HUD symbology becomes combat-specific.  
  
  Press the Enter key to select the air-to-air HUD mode.  
  
  Press the Enter key again to cycle through any air-to-air  
missiles on board and activate the relevant air-to-air systems.  
  
MASTER ARM INDICATOR    
Informs you that the currently selected weapon is armed and ready  
to fire.  
  
AIMING RETICULE    
This 'kill circle' appears on the HUD when an air-to-air missile  
is selected. The size of the Aiming Reticule depends on the  
chosen missile: a small circle is used for long-range stand-off  
weapons such as the AAAM, and a large circle is for short-range  
missiles. Your target must be inside this circle if the missile  
is to hit it.  
  
ASPECT ANGLE CARET    
Shows the target aircraft's heading relative to you. If the caret  
is at the bottom of the Aiming Reticule, the target is flying  
away from you. If the caret is at the top, the target is flying  
toward you.  
  
TRACKING INFORMATION    
On any aircraft being tracked by your radar as follows:  
  
AIRCRAFT TYPE  
CURRENT HEADING  
RANGE (MILES)  
  
  Press the C key to toggle tracking between any aircraft within  
range.  
   
DIAMOND X    
When you see this diamond with an 'X' at its center, you will  
know that a target is outside the HUD view. Fly in the direction  
of the Diamond X until the target enters the HUD view. The  
Diamond X will change to a Target Designator Box.  
  
TARGET DESIGNATOR BOX    
Appears around the target when it's inside the Aiming Reticule -  
even if the target is beyond visual range.  
  
MISSILE SEEKER HEAD   
When a target has been picked up by the designator box and is in  
range, the Missile Seeker Head diamond appears inside the HUD's  
Aiming Reticule. The diamond will come to rest and flash when the  
Missile Seeker Head locks on to the enemy target. The currently  
selected missile is now locked on to the target and ready to  
launch.  
  
THE BIG X    
Flashes across the entire HUD when the target is too close to be  
hit with your currently selected weapon - in which case switch to  
a short-range weapon such as the cannon.  
  
AIR-TO-GROUND HUD MODE  
When this mode is chosen, air-to-ground targeting radars are  
activated, the flight model will change to air-to-ground attack  
profile and air-to-ground weapons can be selected. If your  
aircraft is carrying GBU bombs, the Laser Target Designator will  
become available.  When a weapon is in range, then "IN RNG"  
appears on the bottom left of the HUD.  For some air-to-ground  
missiles, the actual distance to the target being shown may be  
presented until the "IN RNG" appears.  
  
  Press the backspace key to select the air-to-ground HUD mode.  
  
MASTER ARM INDICATOR    
Informs you that the currently selected weapon is armed and ready  
to fire.  
  
THE AIMING CROSS    
The most prominent feature of air-to-ground mode is this  
crosshair which is used to target air-to-ground weapons.  
  
LAUNCHING MAVERICK MISSILES    
To target a non-GBU or non-guided weapon, line up your aircraft  
with the target until it is shown in the HUD crosshair.  
  
  Press the spacebar to lock on to the target.  
  
When you have locked on to the target (also known as 'pickling  
the target'), a target designator box will be shown. (The target  
designator box will appear over any ground target with a lock on  
it, whether it was made by 'pickling' or by the Laser Target  
Designator.)  
  
  Press the spacebar again to launch the missile.  
  
DROPPING A MK82 FREEFALL BOMB    
When you select this weapon, a Continuous Computerized Impact  
Point (CCIP) line emanates from the center of the crosshair on  
the HUD. The CCIP line shows the path the weapon will take if it  
is launched at that moment. A small circle at the end of the line  
shows the projected impact point, which means that the aircraft  
is at a suitable angle to launch the weapon. Approach the target  
at a steep angle (30-40 degree dive) and as soon as that small  
aiming circle on the end on the line crosses the target, release  
the bomb. Note: this is best done at an altitude of 2,000 ft or  
more.  
  
CANNON    
When the air-to-ground cannon is selected, a trajectory line  
appears on the HUD to project the impact point of the cannon  
fire.  
  
INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM HUD MODE  
A variation of the navigation mode HUD comes into effect when the  
Instrument      Landing System is activated.  
  
Take note of the information displayed at the bottom of the HUD  
and use it in conjunction with the HUD guidelines and the AoA  
Indexer to make a perfect landing.  
  
REFUEL HUD MODE  
A variation of the air-to-air HUD comes into effect when you are  
set to refuel (see REFUELLING on page 33).  
  
Instead of an enemy target, the HUD tracks the refuel aircraft.  
Note that all weapons systems are shut down for refuelling.  
  
MILITARY SPECIFICATION FLIGHT MODEL  
  
The HUD has a few extra features when using the Military  
Specification flight model.  
  
ANGLE OF ATTACK INDICATOR    
Your aircraft's - in 10 degrees increments.  
  
VERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR    
Shows the vertical speed of the aircraft in units of feet per  
second. The VSI is mainly used to perform good landings (a  
healthy VSI landing speed is up to 10 feet per second).  
  
THE AUTO PILOT  
  
TFX has a 'proper' auto pilot system which controls the aircraft  
by adjusting joystick and throttle inputs. There are four main  
modes, as well as a special 'panic button' mode. When auto pilot  
is activated, the Control MFD shows the auto pilot mode and any  
appropriate data.  
The following details (shown on the Control MFD) are inputs to  
the auto pilot which adjusts the aircraft controls in an attempt  
to match your requirements.  
  
MODE 1: WAYPOINT    
Directs your aircraft at the chosen speed to the next waypoint.  
Use the up and down arrow (cursor keys) to adjust the waypoint  
altitude.  
  
MODE 2: HEADING    
Maintains the required heading, altitude and speed - adjusted  
with the arrow (cursor) keys.  
  
MODE 3: TRACKING    
Directs your aircraft toward the aircraft you are tracking on  
radar. The default speed is the aircraft's own, but adjustments  
can be made.  
  
MODE 4: AUTO THROTTLE    
Leaves the joystick (or mouse or key) control in the hands of the  
pilot, but uses throttle to maintain the speed shown in the  
Control MFD. Your aircraft's speed will not remain constant in  
all situations, for example, no great speed can be sustained in  
an 80 degree climb.  
  
RECOVERY MODE   
A special feature of the Eurofighter 2000 and many Russian-built  
fighters. In TFX it is available for all three aircraft. The  
aircraft is returned to straight and level flight. It is not a  
guaranteed crash evasion technique, so it should be used early,        
if you become disoriented, or are in a steep dive.  
  
SECTION FIVE  
  
HOW TO FLY  
  
Here's Rod Kennedy to hold the hands of anyone using the Military  
Specification flight model for the first time.  
  
TAKEOFF  
At the start of the flight you will find yourself at one end of a  
very long runway, with your engines off. Before switching them  
on, check the weather conditions (if you have weather activated).  
  
  Press and hold an Alt key then press the W key to check the  
weather conditions. The information is displayed in the Internal  
Communications area.  
  
The following points must be considered:  
  
 If the runway is wet or icy, you require a longer takeoff  
distance.  
  
 If you have a full tank of fuel and a lot of stores, you require  
a longer takeoff distance and a higher takeoff speed.  
  
 If the wind is coming from your tail, you require a higher  
takeoff ground speed.  
  
 If the wind is coming from in front, your takeoff ground speed  
will be lower. (It is always better to take off into headwind.)  
  
 If the wind is coming from either side, be careful. If you are  
in an F-117A, you require a long takeoff distance, but the  
Eurofighter and F-22 are short-takeoff aircraft.  
  
Now check your controls. Make sure your wheel brakes and air  
brakes (if you have them) are off. Now, activate your engines and  
put throttle to 100 per cent. If you have afterburners and need  
to shorten your takeoff run, turn them on and increase the stages  
as necessary. You should find you are beginning to move down the  
runway at increasing speed. When you reach the stated takeoff  
speed for the aircraft you are flying, start to pull back on the  
joystick (or the mouse, or press the 'down arrow' key). Your  
angle of attack indicator should start to rise. Keep clear of the  
stall angle (about 25-30 degrees on an F-22 or Eurofighter, 40  
degrees on an F-117A), and check that you are not losing speed.  
You should soon see your Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI) start to  
rise as you become airborne.  
  
Watch your VSI, and make sure you are gaining speed. If you  
aren't, increase thrust. If this doesn't work, pitch down a  
little, but make sure you don't start to lose altitude. Your  
speed should now be well clear of 200 knots, and your altitude  
should be over 1,000 feet. Retract your undercarriage, and look  
ahead to avoid any hills or mountains. Now check the direction  
for your first waypoint. You are ready to begin the mission  
proper ...  
  
STEADY FLIGHT  
To fly at constant altitude in a constant direction, your wings  
must be level. Check this by looking from the front of the  
cockpit to the horizon. If your wings are level, then the horizon  
will be flat. Next, check your VSI. This is the scale in the top  
right corner of the Head-Up Display (HUD). The line extending up  
or down from the zero mark shows the change in altitude in feet  
per second. The box to the left shows the exact value as a  
number.  
  
To fly at a constant height, you want this reading to be about  
zero. If it is negative, pull gently back on the stick (or  
mouse), or tap the 'down arrow' key. You will see the horizon  
appear to fall as the aircraft's nose rises. How fast this change  
occurs will depend on how far you moved the joystick (or mouse)  
or how long you held the key down, and on whether you were in  
cruise, combat or landing mode. If your VSI has a positive  
reading, then the same applies, but push the joystick (or mouse)  
forward, or press the 'up arrow' key.  
  
TURNING  
Although turning is only a horizontal change of direction,  
airplanes can only perform flat (unbanked) turns at low speeds.  
Normally, the rudders cannot be used simply to turn the  
airplane's nose toward a different heading. Airplanes have much  
more control in pitching (up-down rotation), and so turns are  
made by changing a yawing (sideways turning) motion into one  
involving pitch. This is done by banking the aircraft, that is,  
by raising one wing and lowering the other.  
  
To make a turn, you must bank the aircraft so that your desired  
direction is above your nose. So, push the joystick (or mouse)  
sideways for a second (or press either the 'left arrow' or 'right  
arrow' key), then release it. The aircraft will bank and your  
nose should slowly begin to edge below the horizon as you yaw  
into the turn. Now, pull back on the joystick (or mouse), or tap  
the 'down arrow' key, so as to keep your nose level. You are now  
executing a level turn. The more you bank, the faster you will be  
able to turn with a level nose.  
  
While turning, you are now using only part of your lift to keep  
the aircraft up. The rest of your lift is changing the direction  
of your aircraft's movement. Aerodynamic stability makes sure  
that your aircraft's nose does not stray too far from this  
direction at any time. Obviously, as only part of your lift is  
balancing out your weight, you need more lift in total to stay  
up. When lift is different to weight, you begin to feel the  
effect of the resulting acceleration. This is called g-force.  
  
G-FORCE  
  
Nobody feels the effect of gravity. Gravity acts evenly on every  
particle of your body, so it does not stretch your muscles or  
compress your bones the way other forces can. However, when you  
are in the Earth's gravitational field, you will fall unless  
something stops you. It could be the pavement or the floor of  
your house, or the chair you are sitting on. Something supports  
your weight and provides an equal and opposite force to that  
created by gravity. This you feel. If you are standing on the  
ground, the force that counteracts your weight does not act  
evenly: it acts on your feet, and every part of your weight, from  
your head or your hands or wherever, must be supported by your  
legs and your feet. So you feel your weight in the sense that you  
feel the force transmitted from the ground to your feet to your  
head.  
  
Similarly, if you are in a jet fighter in a tight turn, you feel  
the force that accelerates your body in the same direction as the  
airplane. For comparison, we discuss not the actual force of the  
aircraft on the pilot, which depends on his weight, but the ratio  
of the force to his weight. So, in level flight, your seat exerts  
a force equal to your weight, and you are said to experience 1g  
(pronounced 'one gee'). The same value equals the ratio of the  
lift force of the aircraft to its own weight.  
  
Accelerating upwards adds to the initial 1g - you feel heavier,  
so upward acceleration is said to produce 'positive gees', and  
downward acceleration to produce 'negative gees'. If you were  
flying upside down, your up is down, so you would now experience  
-1g ('negative one gee').  
  
Space shuttle astronauts experience up to 3g acceleration. A  
change of 2g is substantial (one feels twice as heavy under 2g  
acceleration). Normal human tolerance is about 9g and -3g, with  
the use of air force g-suits' which help to alleviate the  
effects. When you are pulling high positive g's, your blood is  
'pulled' towards your lower body and away from your head. This  
can lead to a loss of vision and consciousness, known as  
'blackout'. Under negative g's, blood pools in your upper body  
and head, leading to what is known as 'redout'. Additionally, a  
fast change in acceleration can cause a very fast g-induced loss  
of consciousness, called G-LOC.  
  
In TFX, blackout and redout are simulated on screen as graphical  
effects. In the Realism Menu (see TFX CONFIGURATION on page 50),  
you can define whether you want these effects disabled, and  
whether you want a realistic loss of control in blackout.  
  
LANDING  
  
Landing is a challenge for any new pilot. There is nothing so  
embarrassing as downing eight MiGs, reducing an enemy runway to  
rubble and then spreading the debris of your fighter across the  
length of your own airfield. In TFX, you can always select the  
auto land feature, but there is no better way to end a mission  
than a proper manual landing.  
  
First find an airfield. Activate the Instrument Landing System  
(ILS) HUD mode. If there is a friendly runway nearby you will be  
given the runway direction and heading. Approach from the correct  
direction and check your speed. As you near the runway, it should  
be near the aircraft's stated landing speed (150 knots for the F- 
117A, about 30 knots slower for the other aircraft). If your  
speed is too high, try to slow down by reducing engine rpm, and  
activating air brakes. Your glide path should be around seven  
degrees descending. You can tell if your glide angle is right by  
looking at the horizontal bar on the HUD, the Glide Slope  
Deviation (GSD) bar. When it is in the center, your glide angle  
is correct. The vertical bar is called the Localizer Deviation  
(LD) bar, and measures your offset from the middle of the runway.  
  
To the right hand side of the HUD is the Angle of Attack indexer:  
two arrows around a circle.  
  
 If your Angle of Attack (AoA) is too high, the top arrow  
('caret') will be lit. Increase your speed.  
  
 If your AoA is too low, the bottom caret will be lit. Decrease  
your speed.  
  
 If your AoA is correct, the middle circle will be lit.  
  
 If your glide slope is correct, but your AoA is not, then your  
speed is wrong.  
  
When you make any necessary adjustments, your glide slope  
indicator may go off-center. You must now readjust your pitch  
angle with the joystick (or mouse, or keys) to re-center it. This  
is a continuous process of adjusting glide slope angle and AoA  
until you get it right.  
  
As your speed falls below 180 knots, lower your landing gear. The  
drag from your gear will reduce your speed a little. As you slow  
down and increase your angle of attack, you will notice that  
speed decreases still further, as a result of AoA. It may  
actually be necessary to increase thrust again just to maintain  
your new, lower speed. Do not worry about increasing even to 80  
or 90 per cent military power to stay airborne. Be careful  
though: if you lower your nose, you will speed up again.  
If any of your indicators read badly, if airspeed or altitude is  
too high as you near the runway, do not attempt to land. Throttle  
up and fly over the runway, turn around and head back a few miles  
in the opposite direction, then turn back and try again.  
  
If all goes well, you should arrive at around 50 ft altitude near  
the start of the runway.  Pull back to decrease your glide slope,  
and watch your VSI. As you touch down, it should read less than 5  
ft/s downwards. Increase thrust if necessary to keep speed up as  
you touch down. When you touch the ground, the ground light to  
the left-hand side of the HUD should come on. Reduce thrust, and  
apply your wheel brakes. If you are in a Stealth Fighter, deploy  
your brake parachute now. Reduce rpm to minimum. Soon, as speed  
falls, the NW nose wheel steering light left of the HUD will come  
on. Now use the joystick (or mouse, or the 'left arrow' and  
'right arrow' keys) to steer left or right and keep on the  
runway.  
  
When your speed reaches zero, turn off both engines. You can now  
end the mission.  
  
CARRIER LANDINGS  
  
Only the F-22 is supposed to land on carriers in TFX. In carrier  
missions, you fly               a different version of the F-22  
with an air brake, larger wings and tougher landing gear. Carrier  
landing with any other aircraft is highly inadvisable, but  
possible in theory. Follow the instructions as above, and  
approach the carrier deck from behind at about 20 degrees anti- 
clockwise from the carrier's forward direction, in order to  
approach the angled deck straight.  
  
Deploy your arrester hook and aim to touch down in the short  
stretch of runway between the start of the deck and the arrester  
wires.  
  
If you hit the deck too quickly, you could bounce right over the  
wires. If you approach too low, your undercarriage will hit the  
back of the deck, which will probably spell D-E-A-T-H. If you  
approach too high, you will miss the hook, which is somewhat less  
disastrous. If you miss, you will need to turn around to make  
another pass. For this reason, when you are almost at the wire,  
turn on your afterburners. If you miss, you don't want to stall.  
Even with full afterburners, the wire will be strong enough to  
stop your aircraft.  
  
EMERGENCIES  
  
In landing, many things can go wrong. If your aircraft is already  
damaged, landing may be made much harder, but attempting a crash  
landing if possible is always preferable to ejecting and losing  
your aircraft. If you have engine damage, follow the above  
procedure as best you can. You may have a much higher VSI  
reading, and you could damage your gear, but gliding down with  
both engines out is possible.  
  
Gear damage could prevent you from either retracting or lowering  
your undercarriage. If you cannot lower the undercarriage, land  
without. Try to keep the VSI very low, and deploy the brake chute  
if you have one on touchdown. If things look bad when you hit the  
ground, eject.  
  
If your wheel brakes are damaged, it will be harder to stop.  
Deploy the brake chute and air brakes. If you look like careering  
off the end of the runway, deploy your arrester hook. Every  
runway has arrester cables for emergency landings.  
If you can't actually land on the runway, land near to it. You  
will be in for a rough ride, but should have a good chance.  
  
DAMAGE  
  
All of the systems in your aircraft are susceptible to damage  
which affects the appearance of the displays and the behavior of  
your aircraft. Unless the damage is minor, your priority should  
be to return home alive and, if possible, with your aircraft  
intact.  
  
Damage can be inflicted upon your aircraft by AAA, SAMs - even  
farmers with shotguns! The master warning panel and caution panel  
will alert you of the damage. If serious damage occurs and you  
have lost control and power you still may be able to perform an  
emergency landing and land safely.  
  
The player should only eject as a last resort if the aircraft is  
on fire and spinning to the ground or a direct missile hit.  
  
The warning display panel on your multi-function display when lit  
red then that particular system is damaged beyond repair or has  
failed totally. When the system is yellow this is not permanent  
damage and can be rectified.  
  
REFUELING  
  
There will come a time when the tiger in your tank is exhausted  
and you run out of fuel. Fortunately for the forgetful, you are  
warned that your fuel is running low, in which case the time is  
nigh to refuel. You have a choice:  
  
* Find a friendly runway and land (where you will also be  
rearmed).  
  
* Find a KC Tanker - a refueling aircraft.  
  
Both methods are not easy and require practice, but it should be  
noted that mucho bonus points are given for refueling in the air.  
  
A KC Tanker is always full of fuel and on standby above the  
clouds, so fly high. The tanker usually operates at a service  
level of 30,000 ft and at a speed of around 300 knots. When you  
are close enough to the KC Tanker and match its speed, it will  
release a fuel line - otherwise known as a 'boom'.  
  
  Press the ' key to open your aircraft's refuel access.  
  
REFUELING THE EUROFIGHTER 2000  
  
A fuel feeding tube is located at the front right-hand side of  
the aircraft (you can see it if you use a Virtual or External  
View). The trick is to fly so that the tube pokes into the end of  
the boom released from the left-hand feeding station of the KC-10  
Twin Boom Tanker. When you manage this, the boom will lock into  
place and refueling will automatically occur. The normal fuel  
feed rate is approximately 300 gallons per minute. The fuel gauge  
shows the quantity of available fuel.  
  
REFUELING THE F-22 AND F-117A  
  
The pilot of an F-22 or F-117A has a far easier time refueling.  
The refuel access is located at the rear of the aircraft,  
directly behind the cockpit. The KC-135E Single Boom Tanker will  
push a feeding probe into the back of your aircraft. All you have  
to do is sit tight and keep your speed, heading and altitude  
constant.  
  
SECTION SIX   
  
COMBAT  
  
Combat has changed dramatically in aerial warfare over the last  
60 years but some basic rules still apply. What follows is some  
straightforward advice which should help you last longer in the  
skies. But first ...  
  
ARMING YOUR AIRCRAFT  
  
Your aircraft is usually armed automatically, but there are times  
when you get to choose the equipment, which is where the Aircraft  
Arming Screen comes into use.  
  
Your choice of weaponry will depend on the mission profile -  
there's no point in wasting space carrying air-to-ground weapons  
when bombing runs are not the order of the day. That said, it's  
advisable to always carry a couple of defensive air-to-air  
missiles when flying the F-22 or Eurofighter.  
  
A miniature representation of your aircraft acts as a pointer  
(note the way that any equipment added is also shown on the  
pointer). Use the mouse to move the pointer around the screen.  
Touch the tip of the pointer on the desired option or equipment.      
(Use the slider to the right of the stock list to view the  
available equipment.)  
  
  Press the left-hand mouse button to select an option or 'pick  
up' a piece of equipment.  
  
  Press the left-hand mouse button when the pointer is not  
touching an option or piece of equipment - the pointer will  
disappear. You can now use the mouse to rotate the aircraft and  
view it from all angles.  
  
  Press the right-hand mouse button to bring back the pointer.  
  
Having 'picked up' a piece of equipment, the possible mounting  
positions are highlighted on the aircraft (if none are shown then  
the equipment cannot be carried by the aircraft in question or a  
box will appear to inform you that no pylons are available for  
that weapon). Move the equipment to the desired mounting. Note  
the internal and external weight limitations.  
  
  Press the left-hand mouse button to place the equipment on the  
mounting.  
  
  Press the right-hand mouse button to place the equipment back  
in stock.  
  
CLEAR ALL    
Select this to remove all equipment from the aircraft.  
  
CLEAR PYLON    
Select this to change the pointer into a red 'eraser'. Now select  
the equipment (on the aircraft) you wish to remove. Ensure that  
you have a clear view of the aircraft's underside, to make the  
removal of equipment easier.  
  
  Press the right-hand mouse button to bring back the pointer.  
  
  Press Escape to reset previous pylon selection.  
  
If you don't want to call the shots you can always let the TFX  
program make the choice of weapons for you ...  
  
DEFAULT    
Select this to load your aircraft with a selection of appropriate  
equipment.  
  
CURRENT SELECTION    
Select this to view the underside of the aircraft - and all  
equipment in position.  
  
OK    
Select this to proceed when you are happy with your choice of  
equipment.  
  
AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT  
  
There are four key ways to keep tabs on the position of enemy  
units: the map, radars, the HUD and visual contact.  
  
The aircraft which is first detected by another is usually the  
victim. Your superior radar capabilities should give you the  
edge, so ensure that your weapons are armed and ready, and that  
your speed, heading and altitude are good. Don't rely solely on  
the radar though - use your eyes to scan the skies thoroughly at  
all times.  
  
Always approach the target from his blind spot - his rear quarter  
- unless you have long range stand-off weapons such as AMRAAM or  
AAM, in which case you should fire them at high speed (Mach 2  
upwards) for maximum kinetic energy at launch.  
  
If the element of surprise is lost, or was never possible, then  
manoeuvrability will be the next deciding factor. The pilot who  
can out-turn and gain the best advantage will be victorious,  
especially in close range combat.  
  
Fighter jets move so fast that it is hard to aim any weapon at an  
enemy unless you are directly behind your target. The aim of any  
close dogfighting is to get behind your enemy's tail ('on his  
six') and keep him in front of you. If he can turn faster than  
you, it will be much harder to do this.   
  
AIR-TO-AIR TACTICS  
  
Using available data from AWACS or your BVR radar, close in on  
any potential bandit from a safe position. Long range tracking  
will inform you of his speed, altitude, heading and range from  
you.  
  
20-60 MILES    
Use long range semi-active 'fire and forget' radar-guided  
missiles.  
  
10-20 MILES    
Use medium range radar-guided missiles.  
  
1-10 MILES    
Use short range radar-guided or infrared heat seeking missiles.  
  
1 MILE OR LESS    
Use the cannon. Missiles can find it difficult to launch, track  
and arm in time.  
  
AIR-TO-GROUND COMBAT  
  
You can attempt to manually use your cannons and missiles to  
destroy ground-based targets, but your best bet is to take  
advantage of the Laser Target Designator wherever possible.  
  
USING THE LASER TARGET DESIGNATOR  
  
This nifty piece of kit allows you to accurately determine a GBU  
bomb's destination to within inches of a target. It has a 100  
mile radius range (but that doesn't mean that the bomb will  
travel that far) and is best used from an altitude of around  
6,000 ft.  
  
The target appears on your radar. Soon you will make visual  
contact. Prepare yourself ... Ensure that the aircraft is on a  
level course before engaging the LTD - you don't want to end up  
crashing.  
  
  Press the backspace key to select air-to-ground mode.  
  
  Press the Z key to activate the Laser Target Designator.  
  
The view will change to show that of the Laser Target Designator  
(Fig 4). The flashing 'T' above the crosshair shows that you have  
yet to select a target.  
A target is selected by directing a laser beam to illuminate it.  
  
  Press the arrow (Cursor) keys to move the crosshair.  
  
  Press the < key to zoom in and the > key to zoom out - up to 10  
times magnification and down to zero.  
  
  Press the Z key to reset the zoom to default.  
  
  Press the Z key when the target is shown inside the lock.  
  
The 'L' above the crosshair will flash instead of the 'T', to  
show that you have locked on to a target. Are you sure that's  
close enough?  
  
  Press the X key to break the lock.  
  
  Press any function (view) key to see the aircraft.  
  
With the lock determined, a 'funnel' (invisible to the eye) is  
created between your aircraft and the target. The computer- 
controlled bomb will attempt to stay within the boundaries of the  
funnel in order to hit its target. You may now launch a bomb.  
  
DEFENSIVE MEASURES  
  
MISSILE EVASION TECHNIQUES  
All the major air forces of the world have infrared heat seeking  
missiles, which lock on to your exhaust pipe, or radar-guided  
missiles which aim for your radar-emitting cockpit and nose cone.  
All are the most dangerous threats you will meet in the skies.  
  
AVOIDING INFRARED MISSILES    
You will know when an infrared missile is heading straight for  
you because the missile warning panel will be flashing 'IR LCK'  
and 'LCH' like crazy. This is not a good time to panic. Drop a  
few decoy flares in the hope that they will appear more appealing  
to the missile than your engines.  
  
Ensure that your afterburners are off then perform a hard brake  
and turn sharply into a defensive position. An infrared missile  
has a narrow field of vision and can easily lose its lock once  
your aircraft - its rear quarter in particular - is out of sight.  
A last minute evasion may avoid the missile because it's heading  
toward you at such a high speed and has no time to turn. However,  
be warned that the latest infrared missiles are persistent and  
will chase you until their fuel runs out.  
  
AVOIDING RADAR-GUIDED MISSILES    
These are tricky blighters, regardless of whether they are  
launched in the air or from the ground. Dropping chaff will cloud  
a radar-guided missile's vision giving you precious split-seconds  
to perform a defensive break and get the hell out of there.  
Unfortunately, it's far harder to break a radar-guided missile's  
lock than it is an infrared's.  
  
The other option open to you is to use Electronic Counter  
Measures. The incoming radar-guided missile will weave  
erratically as its guidance system is screwed up by the powerful  
electronic pulses from your ECM pod.  
  
ADVANCED COMBAT  
  
The previous section of this manual deals with selection and use  
of weapons, but there are some special aspects of manoeuvrability  
which apply mainly to air-to-air combat.  
  
Fighter jets move so fast that it is hard to aim any weapon at an  
enemy unless you are directly behind your target. The objective  
of any close dogfighting is to get behind your enemy's tail ('on  
his six') and keep him in front of you. If he can turn faster  
than you, it will be much harder to do this. There is an equation  
for turn rate which will help you to win:  
  
TURN RATE = a / V  
  
where a is acceleration, which increases with the number of g's  
you are pulling and V is speed.  
  
So a higher g value and a lower speed will give you the best rate  
of turn.  
There is a limit to the number of g's a given fighter can pull  
for any length of time in a level turn. In fact, there are three  
limits:  
  
THE LIFT LIMIT    
The lower your speed, the less lift you can have. If you are  
using all of your lift just to stay up, you cannot turn. So the  
lift limit increases from 1g at the stall speed to ever higher  
values.  
  
THE POWER LIMIT    
Lift causes more drag, and drag slows you down unless you  
increase thrust to compensate. You only have so much thrust  
available, and at high speeds, all your thrust is used just to  
maintain those speeds in level flight. Therefore, the power limit  
is more significant at higher speeds.  
  
THE TOLERANCE LIMIT    
The aircraft and the pilot can only sustain so much stress before  
respectively falling apart or blacking out. Usually the aircraft  
has a higher tolerance than the pilot, who can only stand about  
9g. Some aircraft, like the F-117 A, have a lower structural  
limit.  
  
SECTION SEVEN  
  
MAKING MISSIONS WITH UN CENTRAL COMMAND  
  
It couldn't be simpler. Having selected this option you need to  
pick one of the four possible hot spots from the world map - just  
as you would for most other missions. Note that due to diplomatic  
pressure, the South Atlantic environment is not available. UN  
Central Command is now at your disposal ...  
  
THE MAIN MENU  
  
All UN Central Command options are chosen from here. As you will  
see, keyboard short-cuts are available for some options. Select  
the arrows on the right-hand side of the Main Menu to reveal  
options above and below those shown.  
  
CLEAR MISSION DATA    
Select this followed by 'yes' to wipe the slate clean.  
  
LOAD PREVIOUS MISSION    
From the hard disk. Pick the mission's filename from the list  
shown or select 'cancel'.  
  
SAVE CURRENT MISSION    
To the hard disk. Pick a slot, amend or type a new description if  
necessary, then press the Enter key to save the mission.  
  
PLAY MISSION    
You must save it first (you will be reminded if the mission has  
not been saved).  
  
EXIT TO WORLD MAP    
Select this if you wish to pick another hot spot. You will be  
prompted if your mission has not been saved.  
  
BUILDING A MISSION  
  
You must use all of the following 'SELECT' options to construct a  
mission. A tick next to the 'SELECT' options shows that it has  
been dealt with.  
  
SELECT PLANE    
Choose any one of the three from the menu presented.  
  
SELECT TAKE-OFF    
Well, you have to start somewhere ... When this option is  
selected, all possible takeoff points on the map will flash. Use  
the mouse to move the crosshair around the map.  
  
  Press the right-hand mouse button at any time to return to the  
Main Menu.  
  
  Press the left-hand mouse button to call up information on the  
dot beneath                   
  the crosshair.  
  
The identity and map co-ordinates of the dot below the crosshair  
are given. You can now select the dot as a takeoff point.  
  
SELECT PRIMARY    
There are eight possible Primary Target types: Maritime, Docks,  
Factories, Power Stations, Bridges, Airfields, Military HQs and  
Oil Targets. From the list, pick the targets you wish to  
highlight on the map (they will flash). Note: it's wise not to  
choose too many targets types at once as it can get confusing.  
The process of selecting Primary Targets is the same as that for  
choosing a takeoff point.  
  
SELECT SECONDARY    
Up to five targets are selected in the same way as the Primary  
Targets.  
  
SELECT LANDING    
You have to land somewhere once your mission is complete. Select  
a landing spot in the same way as you chose a takeoff point.  
  
SELECT WEATHER    
Choose from the menu presented any one of the following: 'DAY  
CLEAR', 'DAY CLOUDY', 'NIGHT CLEAR', 'NIGHT CLOUDY', 'STORMY' and  
'TWILIGHT' to determine the general weather conditions.  
  
SELECT ENEMY    
Not specific craft, you understand, but the intensity of enemy  
presence. Choose 'LIGHT', 'MEDIUM' or 'HEAVY' from the menu  
presented.  
  
REVIEW WAYPOINTS    
With all aspects of the mission in place, it's wise to double  
check the waypoint situation. Select this option to review the  
numbered waypoints (you know, the electronic markers used by the  
auto pilot) step-by-step, from takeoff through primary and  
secondary targets to landing. You will be prompted if any one of  
the mission requirements is missing.  
  
Maybe you'd like to add, remove or modify a waypoint? No problem  
...  
  
Use the right hand mouse button to go to Waypoint menu  
  
  Insert mode.  
  
  Delete mode.  
  
  Modify mode.  
  
  KC Tanker mid-air refueler.  
  
  EXIT the waypoint review and return to the Main Menu.  
  
Use the mouse to move the crosshair over a waypoint.  
  
  Press the left-hand mouse button to select the waypoint.  
  
  Press the left-hand mouse button again to either 'pick up' the  
waypoint or delete it, depending on the chosen mode.  
  
Use the mouse to move the new or existing waypoint.  
  
  Press the left-hand mouse button to place the waypoint.  
  
  Press the right-hand mouse button to de-select the waypoint.  
  
  Play Mission: Press enter to play mission.  
  
TEXT AT CURSOR    
Basically, information on the dot beneath the crosshair is shown  
in the top right-hand corner of the screen.  
  
VIEW 3D    
Or 2D for that matter. Toggle between a static Earth Net  
Satellite plan view or a rotating three-dimensional view of the  
area.  
  
  Press the V key to call up a satellite view of the area.  
  
  Press the left-hand mouse button or the 5 key on the numeric  
keypad to toggle between the plan view and the rotating three- 
dimensional view.  
  
  Press the right-hand mouse button or the Esc key to quit the  
satellite view and return to the standard maps.  
  
To move the satellite around the map ...  
  
  Press the 8 key on the numeric keypad to move the view up by  
half a screen.  
  
  Press the 2 key on the numeric keypad to move the view down by  
half a screen.  
  
  Press the 4 key on the numeric keypad to move the view left by  
half a screen.  
  
  Press the 6 key on the numeric keypad to move the view right by  
half a screen.  
  
Note that the mouse can also be used to move the view.  
  
The satellite's altitude is adjusted in large steps as follows  
...  
  
  Press the 1 key to view the area from 800 feet (minimum  
altitude).  
  
  Press the 2 key to view the area from 1,600 feet.  
  
  Press the 3 key to view the area from 3,200 feet.  
  
  Press the 4 key to view the area from 6,400 feet.  
  
  Press the 5 key to view the area from 8,000 feet.  
  
  Press the 6 key to view the area from 16,000 feet.  
  
  Press the 7 key to view the area from 32,000 feet.  
  
  Press the 8 key to view the area from 64,000 feet.  
  
  Press the 9 key to view the area from 96,000 feet.  
  
  Press the 0 key to view the area from 128,000 feet (maximum  
altitude).  
  
ZOOM MAP IN/OUT    
The map as it stands provides a useful overview of the area, but  
it's easier to select targets with a closer look. Note that this  
zoom function does not work with the satellite map.  
  
  Press the Z key to toggle the zoom IN or OUT.  
  
MAP - PHYSICAL    
A relief map of the area - with all targets in place.  
  
  Press the F1 key to select the Physical Map.

Shows clearly the country boundaries - with all targets in place.  
  
  Press the F3 key to select the Political Map.  
  
SECTION EIGHT  
  
CONTROL SUMMARY  
  
Sure, there are dozens of key controls to learn - more than any  
keyboard overlay could conveniently accommodate (hence its  
omission from this package) - but the basic controls are simple  
enough. The rest you will learn through bitter experience ...  
  
BASIC CONTROLS  
  
The aircraft climbs, dives and banks left and right via the  
mouse, a joystick, or the arrow (cursor) keys on your computer's  
keyboard.  
  
The left-hand mouse button is used to increase thrust, and the  
right-hand mouse button is used to decrease thrust.  
  
ENGINES    
All three aircraft flown in TFX are powered by two engines.  
  
  Press the + key to increase the engines' thrust.  
  
  Press the - key to decrease the engines' thrust.  
  
  Press the [ key to ignite or shut down Engine 1.  
  
  Press the ] key to ignite or shut down Engine 2.  
  
AFTERBURNERS    
Just the thing for an instant burst of extra power. The  
Eurofighter 2000 and the F-22 Superstar have four stages of  
afterburner strength while the F-117A has - oh dear - none.  
Afterburners are heavy on the fuel, so use them frugally.  
  
  Press the j key on the numeric keypad to increase the  
afterburner by one stage.  
  
  Press the - key on the numeric keypad to decrease the  
afterburner by one stage.  
  
  Press the / key on the numeric keypad to turn off the  
afterburner.  
  
AUTO PILOT    
Once the auto pilot is engaged, there are four modes of operation  
available. For further details see THE AUTO PILOT on page 25.  
  
  Press the A key to toggle the auto pilot ON or OFF.  
  
  Press the 7 key for auto pilot mode 1.  
  
  Press the 8 key for auto pilot mode 2.  
  
  Press the 9 key for auto pilot mode 3.  
  
  Press the 0 key for auto pilot mode 4.  
  
AUTO LAND    
Sit back, take it easy and let your on-board computer fly you to  
the nearest friendly runway or your final waypoint and perform  
the landing for you.  
  
  Press and hold an Alt key then press the L key to activate the  
computer-controlled landing.  
  
PANIC RECOVERY BUTTON    
Look, it happens to the best of us in combat situations. When the  
going gets a little too heavy and you lose it - and control of  
your aircraft - and find yourself plummeting to the ground, this  
computer-controlled function will do its best to put you  
straight.  
  
  Press the tab key to activate the computer-controlled recovery.  
  
LANDING SYSTEMS  
  
INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM (ILS)    
A useful aid for landing your aircraft. For further details, see  
THE INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM on page 23.  
  
  Press the I key to turn on the ILS.  Once the ILS mode has been  
selected by pressing "I" again, it is possible to find runways  
easier by pressing "m" for map view and any available runways or  
airfields will flash white on the map.  
  
LANDING GEAR    
It's best to land with it down! Note that the Landing Gear may be  
damaged if it's down when your aircraft is flying at high speed.  
  
  Press the G key to toggle the landing gear UP or DOWN.  
  
BRAKES    
Each aircraft flown in TFX has three brake systems. The brake  
parachute works either on the ground or in the air but is ideally  
used to land on a short runway. Remember to turn off your Wheel  
Brakes when powering up to takeoff speed - they may be damaged if  
the rpm exceeds 70 per cent.  
  
  Press the W key to toggle the wheel brakes ON or OFF.  
  
  Press the B key to toggle the air brake ON or OFF.  
  
  Press and hold an Alt key then press the B key to deploy the  
brake chute.  
  
  Press and hold the left-hand shift key then press the B key to  
release the chute.  
  
ARRESTER HOOK    
Located at the rear of the aircraft and used to catch and  
Arrester Wire - either on aircraft carriers or normal runways (in  
emergencies) - in order to slow     the aircraft to a halt (for  
further details see LANDING on page 30).  
  
  Press the H key to toggle the arrester hook UP or DOWN.  
  
NAVIGATION AND DETECTION SYSTEMS  
  
THE HEAD-UP DISPLAY    
The HUD is basically a reflection of the aircraft's main  
instrumentation reflected onto the windshield, so saving pilots  
the inconvenience of taking their eyes off whatever's ahead. TFX  
also features a fundamental helmet-based HUD.  For further  
details, see THE HEAD-UP DISPLAY on page 18.  
  
  Press and hold an Alt key then press the H key to toggle the  
HUD ON or OFF.  
TARGET LOCK  Your aircraft can track up to 10 targets at once.  
  
  Press the C key to toggle the lock between targets.  
  
THE MAP    
A complete overview of your surroundings. Different colored dots  
represent enemy and friendly installations and airborne craft.  
For further details, see THE MAP on page 14.  
  
  Press the M key to toggle the map ON or OFF.  
  
THE MULTI-FUNCTION DISPLAYS    
Each aircraft has three MFDs from which a wealth of information  
is easily accessed. For further details, see MULTI-FUNCTION  
DISPLAYS on page 14.  
  
  Press the 1 key to cycle through MFD1.  
  
  Press the 2 key to cycle through MFD2.  
  
  Press the 3 key to cycle through MFD3.  
  
TOGGLE TARGET VIEWS    
Accessed through MFD1.  
  
  Press the N key to switch between target views.  
  
THE MFD RADAR    
A simplified overview of the friendly and enemy units in the  
vicinity. For further details, see THE MULTI-FUNCTION DISPLAY  
RADAR on page 16.  
  
  Press the R key to switch the radar range between 50 miles, 30  
miles, 10 miles         and 2 miles.  
  
MESSAGES    
Communications from AWACS, control towers, your on-board computer  
and other pilots appear frequently. Take note of what's said.  
  
  Press the L key to display the last displayed message.  
  
INFRARED NIGHT SIGHT    
Yes, you too can see in the dark without the aid of carrots.  
  
  Press and hold the left-hand shift key then press the N key to  
toggle the infrared night sight ON or OFF.  
  
WEAPON SELECTION  
  
Select the weapon type: air-to-air, air-to-ground or cannons.  
Note that the HUD will change to reflect the selection.  
  
  Press the Enter key to select air-to-air weapons.  
  
  Press the Enter key again to switch between the different types  
of air-to-air missiles.  
  
  Press the backspace key to select air-to-ground weapons.  
  
  Press the right-hand Control key to select cannons (and change  
the HUD to    navigation mode).  
  
  Press the spacebar to fire the selected weapon.  
  
THE LASER TARGET DESIGNATOR    
Used to guide GBU air-to-ground missiles to their targets. For  
further details, see USING THE LASER TARGET DESIGNATOR on page  
38.  
  
  Press the Z key to activate the Laser Target Designator.  
  
  Press the arrow (cursor) keys to move the crosshair.  
  
  Press the < key to zoom in and the > key to zoom out.  
  
  Press the Z key when the target is shown inside the lock.  
  
  Press the X key to break the lock.  
  
  Press any function (view) key to see the aircraft.  
  
DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS  
  
CHAFF    
Literally little pieces of tin foil which confuse the hell out of  
radar-guided missiles. Note that chaff is always in limited  
supply, regardless of the play option.  
  
  Press the Insert key to release chaff.  
  
FLARES    
Used to confuse heat-seeking missiles. Note that flares are  
always in limited supply, regardless of the play option.  
  
  Press the Delete key to release flares.  
  
ECM    
Electronic Counter Measure. The aircraft lights up like a  
Christmas tree to every radar and tracking device within 200  
miles so use it only when you have been detected. It confuses any  
radar tracking devices. ECM works in two ways: it gives inbound  
radar-guided missiles a nervous fit - as they attempt to home in  
they shake violently and cannot manoeuvre fast enough. It also  
prevents or makes it more difficult for the enemy fighter to lock  
a missile on to you.  
  
  Press the E key to emit ECM.  
  
STEALTH    
Effectively the opposite of ECM. Your aircraft becomes 'passive',  
receiving but not emitting signals, which makes it almost  
invisible on radar.  
  
  Press the S key to activate stealth mode.  
  
OTHER SYSTEMS  
  
EJECT    
When it all goes horribly wrong and death is on line, why settle  
for anything less than survival? (Well, there is a great danger  
of being captured if you eject over enemy territory.)  
  
  Press the Esc key TWICE to eject from your aircraft. Note that  
your descent can be controlled to a limited degree.  
  
Please note: eject wisely. Should you decide to ditch the  
aircraft in a situation which is not life threatening, you risk  
Court Martial proceedings for destroying $100 million worth of  
hardware.  
  
JETTISON    
Your aircraft's fuel tank and air-to-ground stores can become a  
liability in certain situations. For example, when using the  
Military Specification flight model, the added weight makes your  
aircraft more cumbersome in air-to-air combat. With the loss of  
weight you gain maneuverability. Just try not to drop your load  
on innocent civilians.  
  
  Press and hold an Alt key then press the J key to jettison your  
aircraft's fuel tank and air-to-ground stores.  
  
REFUEL  ACCESS   
It needs to be open if you are to refuel in mid-air. For further  
details, see REFUELING on page 33.  
  
  Press the ' key to open your aircraft's refuel access.  
  
WEATHER CONDITIONS    
Sometimes you need to know whether the weather is good or bad.  
  
  Press an Alt key then press the W key to call up the weather  
conditions in the Internal Communications area.  
  
SPECIAL FUNCTIONS  
  
PAUSE   
Maybe you want to answer the door or the call of nature ...  
  
  Press the P key to freeze the action.  
  
  Press any key to resume play.  
  
TFX CONFIGURATION    
Adjust pertinent play details (for further details see TFX  
CONFIGURATION on page 2).  
  
  Press the `  (above tab key) key to call up the preferences  
screen.  
  
VIDEO RECORDER    
A state-of-the-art system used to record the action as you see  
it. Any footage of 3D action will be broadcast immediately after  
the mission at a special television press conference - so make it  
look good!  
  
  Press and hold the left-hand Alt key then press the V key to  
toggle the video recorder ON or OFF.  
  
Note: there may be a slight pause as the video footage is written  
to the hard disk. If hard disk space is limited, keep the footage  
short and sweet.  
  
ACCELERATED TIME    
Lengthy flights across barren terrain can prove a real drag. To  
compensate for this, time itself can be increased by a factor of  
10. Note that everything in the TFX world will speed up -  
including your aircraft's handling and the enemy's movements!  
  
  Press the T key to toggle accelerated time ON or OFF.  
  
QUIT    
Without dying - but only if your mission is complete.  
  
  Press and hold the left-hand shift key then press the Q key to  
quit play.  
  
VIEW CONTROLS  
  
An unprecedented number of possible viewpoints are on offer ...  
  
INTERNAL VIEWS    
From the cockpit.  
  Press the F1 key for a fixed forward view - with full  
instrumentation.  
  
  Press the Page Up key to move the cockpit UP.  
  
  Press the Page Down key to move the cockpit DOWN.  
  
  Press the F2 key to swing the view to the left (in 60 degree  
steps).  
  
  Press the F3 key to swing the view to the right (in 60 degree  
steps).  
  
  Press the F4 key to look behind you.  
  
  Press and hold the right-hand shift key and then press the F1  
key for a full forward view  
  
  - without instrumentation.  
  
VIRTUAL COCKPIT VIEWS    
A step further than the standard internal views ... You can view  
the cockpit as though you were sitting in it for real. Sure, the  
control panel cannot be read, and it can all prove a little  
disorientating at first, but the benefits will become clear ...  
  
  Press the F10 key for a Virtual Cockpit View.  
  
  Press and hold the right-hand shift key then press the arrow  
(cursor) keys to look around the cockpit.  
  
EXTERNAL VIEWS    
There's nothing more exhilarating than viewing your aircraft's  
performance through an external 'camera'. Your aircraft's  
altitude, speed and heading are shown in a panel at the bottom of  
the screen.  
  
  Press the D key to toggle the flight details ON or OFF.  
  
  Press the F6 key for a 'fly-past' view of your aircraft.  
  
  Press the F5 key to view the aircraft from behind.  
  
  Press the F5 key a second time to pull the view back. You can  
now pan the 'camera' around the aircraft.  
  
  Press and hold the right-hand shift key then press any of the  
following keys...  
  
  Press the arrow (cursor) keys to pan the 'camera' around the  
aircraft.  
  
  Press the End key to zoom out.  
  
  Press the Home key to zoom in.  
  
  Press the Page Up key to rotate the view to the left.  
  
  Press the Page Down key to rotate the view to the right.  
  
WEAPON VIEWPOINTS    
Some of the most impressive views are those from behind or inside  
weapons.  
  
  Press the F8 key to follow cannon-fire or a missile.  
  
  Press the F8 key TWICE for an infrared missile's-eye view.  
  
ENEMY VIEWPOINTS    
It's kinda handy (and fun) to keep tabs on your position relative  
to the enemy's.  
  
  Press the F7 key to view your aircraft and the enemy airborne  
or ground-based craft you are tracking - on the same screen, no  
less.  
  
TARGET VIEW    
An external view of the area near your selected target, be it  
airborne or ground-based. This view also shows your aircraft's  
refuel access when refueling or the runway or the carrier when  
using the ILS.  
  
  Press the F9 key for a target view.  
  
APPENDIX ONE   
  
MISSION PROFILES  
  
It is often thought that fighter aircraft tackle seven distinct  
types of mission.                   They are as follows:  
  
INTERCEPTION    
You have been scrambled to meet incoming hostiles. Stop them at  
all costs.  
  
AIR SUPERIORITY    
Win control of the sky by taking out all airborne enemy craft in  
the area.  
  
ANTI-ARMOUR    
Use multiple 'bomblettes' against heavily-armoured tanks and  
vehicles.  
  
CLOSE AIR SUPPORT    
Provide air cover for ground-based troops.  
  
INTERDICTION    
Destroy a fixed ground target, be it a bridge or a factory. This  
is the most common mission you will encounter. Most missions for  
the F-117A are of                the Interdiction variety.  
  
DEFENSE SUPPRESSION    
Destroy ground-based targets such as SAM radars and SAM sites.  
  
MARITIME    
A battle over the water against ships or carrier-based  
operations.  
  
TFX caters for all seven mission profiles. Be warned that often  
you will need to complete more than one mission profile at the  
same time.  
  
The TFX environment is a vast, fully realized portion of the  
world's potential and actual trouble spots. All terrain is  
accurately mapped and the world as a whole remains consistent  
between missions (so anything destroyed stays destroyed). The TFX  
environment is split into five distinct 'climes' which  
incorporate specific missions to test your mettle.  
  
SOMALIA    
Operation Restore Hope II.   
Famine is rife once again and General Mohammed Aideed's warlords  
are on the war-path. It's time for the UN to sort out this  
horrific situation once and for all. Can you crush the oppressors  
to allow relief convoys to move in?  
  
COLOMBIA    
The Drugs War.   
The government has been ousted and civil war is raging between  
the new force (the drug cartels) and those loyal to the former  
regime. Normally the UN doesn't get involved in such internal  
messes, but this time the possibility of a drugs explosion has  
far-reaching, world-wide consequences.  
  
LIBYA    
Saddam Hussein has denied access to inspectors in search of proof  
of nuclear weapons production. It's down to the UN to make him  
see sense.  
  
YUGOSLAVIA    
The Balklands is still the tinderbox of Europe, and war has  
exploded again as the armies of Serbia and Croatia attempt to  
carve up Bosnia and besiege the UN-declared safe havens.  
  
THE SOUTH ATLANTIC    
Somewhere around South Georgia ... In 1999 the biggest oil  
discovery the world has ever seen has resulted in neighboring  
countries clambering to make claims. England and Argentina have  
sovereign rights but the South Americans want the oil so badly  
they will even go to war for it. To make matters worse, a ship  
carrying enough plutonium to produce 200 heavyweight nuclear  
bombs has gone missing in the area. The UN have been called in to  
find out what's going on ... and maybe wage battle against  
whatever lies in wait.  
  
APPENDIX TWO  
  
ELEMENTS OF AN AIRPLANE  
  
WINGS    
The wings are there to create lift. In a fighter, they are  
usually swept back to reduce drag at high Mach numbers.  
  
TAILPLANE    
Or horizontal tail. Stabilizes the aircraft, by creating a nose  
down moment at high angles of attack. It is also used to control  
pitching (see ELEVATORS).  
  
TAILFIN    
Or vertical tail, stabilizes the aircraft, by creating a yawing  
moment when the aircraft is side-slipping. It is also used for  
steering (see RUDDER).  
  
CONTROL SURFACES  
  
AILERONS    
These are parts of the wing on the trailing edge, hinged so as to  
be mobile, which are deflected in opposite directions to roll the  
aircraft, by increasing lift on one wing and decreasing it on the  
other.  
  
ELEVATORS    
These are usually located on the tailplane. Often, they are the  
tailplane. The elevators create a pitching moment to change angle  
of attack or maneuver the aircraft.  
  
RUDDER    
This is usually a hinged surface on the trailing edge of the  
tailfin, which is used to steer the aircraft at low speed and to  
co-ordinate turns and to control rolling at high angles of  
attack.  
  
HIGH LIFT DEVICES  
  
FLAPS    
Like ailerons, these can be on the trailing edge of the wing, but  
are used to increase lift overall and increase the maximum lift.  
They are used to reduce take-off and landing speed and distance.  
Deployed flaps increase drag, and so are retracted at higher  
speeds. Many airplanes have leading edge flaps which increase  
maximum lift, although they slightly decrease the lift at any  
given angle of attack.  
  
SLATS    
These extendible devices take the place of leading edge flaps,  
delaying stall at high angles of attack.  
  
ENGINES  
  
The jet engine is a device which takes in air, propels it to high  
speed, and ejects it at the back, producing thrust. There are two  
main kinds:  
  
TURBO-JET    
Takes in air at the front, compresses it, and burns fuel inside a  
combustion chamber. The hot, high speed jet of gas drives a  
turbine (hence 'turbo'), a windmill-like rotor at the back, which  
powers the compressor, which is like a many-bladed propeller, and  
leaves from the nozzle, accelerating to supersonic velocities.  
  
TURBO-FAN    
Puts only a proportion of the compressed air into the combustion  
chamber - the rest flows around the outside of the combustion  
chamber and meets with the jet flow after the turbine. A turbo- 
fan is more efficient than an equivalent turbo-jet, but produces  
less thrust.  
  
Almost all modern jet engines are turbo-fans, but the new high  
thrust engines which will power the F-22 and Eurofighter 2000 are  
turbo-fans with low bypass ratios, meaning that most of the air  
flows through the combustion chamber.  
  
AFTERBURNER    
For extra thrust in certain situations, more fuel is put into the  
mixture than can be burned in the combustion chamber. When it  
meets the outside air in the nozzle, the fuel is lit, producing  
very high thrust, at the expense of high fuel consumption. The  
system which does this is called an afterburner, and the effects  
can often be seen as a visible flame coming from the nozzles.  
  
UNDERCARRIAGE  
  
Or landing gear. A set of wheels put down for landing to support  
the aircraft on the runway. It must be retracted at higher speeds  
in the air as it causes drag and is not designed for high speed  
flight.  
  
THE ELEMENTS OF AN AIRPLANE IN TFX  
  
All of the above elements are modeled in TFX in terms of their  
effects on the force and turning characteristics of the  
airplanes. For example, moving the joystick (or mouse) up and  
down (or pressing the up and down arrow keys) adjusts the  
elevator position. This affects the angle of attack, which in  
turn affects wing lift and thus maneuver the aircraft.  
  
APPENDIX THREE  
  
THE TFX AIRCRAFT  
  
All three aircraft in TFX are high performance vehicles with a  
great deal of money and research invested in them. At the time of  
writing, the Eurofighter 2000 and the F-22 have yet to fly. Much  
information about the F-117/A is still classified. However, from  
the published data, it has been possible to estimate key aspects  
of each vehicle's performance.

TFX PILOTS' NOTES  
  
Handling is 'carefree', with many automatic safety features:  
landing gear auto-retracts at high speed, angle of attack is  
limited automatically, and a 'panic button' initiates recovery to  
level flight in emergencies. Leading edge slats and trailing edge  
flaps are adjusted automatically for optimum benefit. External  
stores increase drag, roll inertia and mass.  
  
DEVELOPMENT HISTORY  
  
Since the war, the price of developing a combat aircraft has  
steadily risen, with the effect that fewer and fewer companies  
have been involved in their production, and almost none have been  
built recently without government funding. In Europe, only France  
and Sweden have continued to build fighters, with often state- 
owned companies surviving on exports.  
  
Some European countries have bought US airplanes, like the  
Phantom and the F-16. Others have joined forces. Companies from  
the UK, Germany and Italy formed Panavia in the 1970s to develop  
the Tornado strike aircraft for the three nations. The lack of a  
dedicated fighter has led to the Tornado's adaptation to serve in  
the air-to-air role, but the Panavia partners - Aeritalia,  
British Aerospace and MBB - seeing in 1982 that the requirement  
for dogfighting capability in a modern air force would continue,  
proposed  a new one-man fighter, the Agile Combat Aircraft (ACA),  
a canard-configured, twin-finned aircraft.  
  
The ACA was never given the go-ahead, but in 1983, France,  
Germany, the UK, Italy and Spain outlined a joint requirement for  
a new combat aircraft, to enter service in the 1990s. It was to  
be called the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA). Towards its  
development, the British government funded a technology  
demonstration aircraft, the Experimental Aircraft Programme  
(EAP), built by BAe and Aeritalia. Not strictly a prototype, the  
EAP was a research vehicle for the technologies involved in the  
EFA programme.  
  
France withdrew from the EFA programme in 1985, and in 1992,  
Germany threatened to do the same but was convinced by the  
remaining nations to remain, although the German aircraft will  
lack some of the systems present in the other airplanes, and more  
of the funding will come from industry. Following the four-nation  
meeting on December 10th, 1992, the name EFA was dropped ... The  
aircraft was to be called the Eurofighter 2000.  
  
CONFIGURATION  
  
The Eurofighter 2000 has a canard configuration, meaning that the  
'tail' is mounted forward of the main wings. This is inherently  
unstable, for the following reason:  
  
In a normal fighter, the all-moving tail is used to pitch the  
aircraft up and down. Deflecting the tail down gives it a  
negative angle of attack, and thus a downward force, which turns  
the whole aircraft nose-up. As this happens, the initial  
deflection of the tail is offset by the overall motion of the  
aircraft, and so the pitching force is reduced, as the aircraft  
moves to a higher, stable angle of attack.  
If the tail is at the front, it is turned upwards to create a  
nose-up pitch, and the resulting motion increases the force on  
the canard, so then in order to stabilize the higher AoA,  the  
canards must be deflected entirely the other way, or the whole  
aircraft will pitch up into a stall.  
  
The advantages of the canard are that it is never in the wake of  
the wing, and so retains its effectiveness at high angles of  
attack. A canard configured airplane can have less afterbody  
(tail-end) drag than an equivalent aft-tailed version. The canard  
can be smaller than a tail would need to be, as demonstrated in  
the 2000's tiny 25.9 sq. ft. canard area.  
  
Only now, with the advent of digital flight control systems  
(DFCS) can the canard be used as a means of control. Even so, a  
spokesman for the company which pioneered unstable, computer  
controlled fighters is reported to have said: "In the view of  
General Dynamics, the optimum location of a canard is on somebody  
else's airplane."  
  
In spite of this obvious difference, detractors have described  
the Eurofighter 2000 as      'F-16 Plus'. In the same weight  
class as General Dynamics' (now Lockheed Fort Worth) successful  
fighter, the Eurofighter has a much larger wing, at 165 ft., and  
with two 90 kN (kilo Newton) engines, compared to F-16's single  
122 kN, the Eurofighter has more power for maneuvering.  
  
The Eurofighter will have a variable shape mission adaptive wing  
(MAW), using           slats and flaps.  
  
The fighter will have a 'glass cockpit' of modern design, with  
three MFDs. Most       versions will have a helmet mounted  
targeting system, and direct voice input (DVI) for non-critical  
functions.

TFX PILOTS' NOTES  
  
The F-117A has no high-lift devices and low CLa (increase of lift  
with AoA) so at all speeds, angle of attack will be positive for  
level flight. Stalling characteristics are highly unpredictable.  
Never stall the F-117A. Maneuverability is low and flight is  
subsonic.  
  
Landing is complicated by a high AoA which means that the pilot  
can lose sight of the runway. Furthermore, as landing speed is  
high, always deploy brake chute on landing,  but never before  
touchdown.  
  
DEVELOPMENT HISTORY  
  
Another development since World War II is that radar has created  
an open battle field for aircraft. Any attack in enemy territory  
involved the risk of being detected early - in fact, in the late  
60s, the risk was a certainty, without an extensive array of  
radar jamming equipment, radar warning devices and chaff-bombs.  
Often, these were carried by other aircraft, with strike aircraft  
headed for the primary target, and the majority of the aircraft   
in a mission acting as defense-suppression aircraft.  
  
Jamming techniques struggled, and often failed, to keep up with  
new radar technology. Radar absorbent materials (RAM) were being  
developed, but did not in themselves provide the necessary  
reduction in radar cross-section (RCS) to be of real benefit.  
Some engineers envisaged a more comprehensive solution. In 1975,  
the US Air Force held a Radar Camouflage Symposium, the  
proceedings of which have not yet been declassified. The same  
year, Engineers at Lockheed's 'Skunk Works' designed an aircraft  
with hardly any curved surfaces at all. The simple concept was  
that a sharp edge reflects much less radiation than a rounded  
surface. The trick was in predicting every possible path of  
reflected radiation from its source to the aircraft to its final  
direction, and this was only possible with the new computer  
technology becoming available in the late 70s.  
  
After some tests on the basic shape, Lockheed obtained funding  
from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) for two  
sub-scale flying prototypes of a stealth attack aircraft. Code  
named, Have Blue, the project went ahead, after control was  
transferred for security reasons from the civilian DARPA to the  
USAF. Little was heard publicly of stealth until the mid 80s.  
  
The first Have Blue prototype flew in early 1978, testing flying  
characteristics. The second was given the complete stealth  
treatment, with RAMs and tightly-fitted panels, for tests against  
captured Soviet radar-guided missiles and other threats. The  
first prototype was lost in a crash due to a high vertical speed  
on final approach, but the second went on to prove the capability  
of a nearly radar invisible design, before itself crashing.  
  
The full-scale development program was code-named Senior Trend,  
and a full-size F-117A was flown on June 18th 1982. The aircraft  
is not known to have an official name, but is variously known as  
Stealth Fighter, Nighthawk, and Black Jet. The Groom Lake  
development testing team named it the Scorpion.  
  
CONFIGURATION  
  
The F-117A was designed to resolve two conflicting requirements -  
stealth and the ability to fly - but does so very well.  
Inevitably unstable in all three axes, it is made 'flyable' by a  
GEC Astronics flight control system, as used by the F-16.  
  
The faceted shape is not ideal for smooth airflow, but there are  
advantages. Use is made of 'vortex lift', whereby low pressure  
vortices are formed over the wing and body at high angles of  
attack, augmenting lift. The high sweepback is necessary, because  
due to aerodynamic and structural demands, the leading edges of  
the wings must have appreciable curvature. This means that they  
will reflect radar, but the sweepback ensures that they reflect a  
frontal radar signal sharply away from the source.  
  
The sharply swept wing behaves in some ways like a delta,  
especially at low speeds, when, due to the low aspect ratio and  
lack of any high-lift devices, high angles of attack are  
necessary. This is one reason for the unusually high take-off and  
landing speeds.

TFX PILOTS' NOTES  
  
Landing gear is likely to be 'hard-wired' (manually controlled)  
as on the prototype. Handling will be 'carefree'. Effects of  
internal stores should be minimal, apart from increase in weight.  
  
DEVELOPMENT HISTORY  
  
In the 1950s, supersonic fighters first appeared in large  
numbers. They had engines which stretched from nose to tail, to  
produce enough thrust to exceed the sound barrier, with stubby  
swept or delta wings to minimize drag. It was found that although  
crossing Mach 1 took tremendous energy, little more was required  
to push the fighter to Mach 2 and beyond.  
  
In the US, speed was increasingly seen as the fighter's best  
asset, to the cost of maneuverability and visibility. Lockheed's  
Starfighter was an example, its high tail proving inadequate at  
high angles of attack. In Vietnam, only McDonnell's F-4 Phantom  
II was consistently successful. It was learned (or re-learned)  
that even in the missile age, combat often came down to out- 
turning the enemy and bringing cannon to bear. The US Air Force  
outlined its new requirements in the FX program. The new fighter  
was to have no greater a maximum speed than the Phantom, but  
greater range, and vitally, it was to be agile. The winner,  
McDonnell Douglas' F-15, was the first modern fighter, with a  
massive wing and the engine power to overcome the drag entailed,  
not by higher Mach numbers, but the lift-dependent drag of fast  
turning.  
  
In the early 1980s, when the Reagan administration required work  
to begin on what was called an Advanced Tactical Fighter, the  
industry and the USAF outlined the requirements in the light of  
current technological developments. The ATF was to be a counter- 
air fighter with supersonic cruise (supercruise), Short Take-Off  
and Landing (STOL) capability, and a high combat radius. The F- 
117A was still a close secret, but the prospect of low  
observability for a fighter was proposed by Northrop among  
others. The ATF was to have 'low observables' if possible.  
  
Alongside the Air Force program, the US Navy agreed in 1986 to  
consider a naval version of the ATF (NATF) as a replacement for  
the mainly air-to-air Grumman F-14.  
  
Years previously, Northrop had a competing design to Lockheed's  
F-117A, similarly faceted, but with a single intake and delta  
wing. When the F-117A was being tested at Groom, another Northrop  
stealth airplane, this time without major visible faceting, was  
also under test. Possibly, new supercomputer systems made it  
possible to predict the radar response behavior of much more  
complex shapes, such as Northrop's later B-2 Stealth Bomber.  
Lockheed too believed in the concept of a true stealth fighter.  
Of the seven proposals submitted, Lockheed's and Northrop's were  
considered by the USAF to be the best.  
  
Lockheed, General Dynamics and Boeing agreed to work together if  
any of them won the contract. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas also  
agreed to co-operate. The two leading designs were designated YF- 
22 and YF-23, the Y prefix denoting a combination of new and  
established technology. Two prototypes of each were to be built  
and evaluated, in conjunction with flight testing of the two  
competing ATF engines, the Pratt and Whitney YF-119 and the  
General Electric YF-120.  
  
Engine technology was crucial to ATF. For the new challenge of  
supersonic cruise without afterburner, the low-bypass turbofans  
were to be in the unprecedented 156 kN thrust range, with a very  
high proportion available on military power. In the original ATF  
specification, vertical thrust vectoring was required for  
manoeuvrability and STOL capability. The result was that the  
engines had two-dimensional (rectangular) exhaust nozzles, which  
vectored 20 degrees in either direction. The thrust reversal  
requirement was deleted, and STOL and thrust vectoring soon  
followed. However Lockheed decided to include vectoring in their  
prototype, the YF-22.  
  
The Demonstration-Validation (Dem-Val) program required each team  
to state predicted performance of their aircraft, and validate  
the data in flight. The YF-23 flew first, the design revealed for  
the first time. A long, sleek structure, reminiscent of  
Lockheed's SR-71, the YF-23 made use of Northrop's 'seamless'  
stealth design philosophy.  
  
By contrast, the YF-22 was shorter and more conventional, looking  
much like a stealthy  F-15, which may have been what the Air  
Force was looking for. Tested to a 60 degrees angle of attack,  
and, contrary to some reports, to beyond Mach 2, the YF-22 was  
sold as a super-maneuverable dogfighter. It is thought unlikely  
that the YF-23 was as agile in pitch as its rival, although  
according to YF-22 test pilot Tom Morgenfeld, it may have been a  
little faster in supercruise.  
  
The USAF never made clear their criteria for selection, but the  
YF-22 was chosen for development as the production ATF, now to be  
called the F-22. Pratt and Whitney's     YF-119 won the engine  
contract. The Naval ATF, if it goes ahead, may not be based on  
the same prototype as the Air Force version. Lockheed's own  
design has major differences, including a larger wing, presumably  
for lower landing speeds. The landing gear and overall structure  
will have to be stronger, and stealth will be less of a priority  
for strike escort and carrier protection.  
  
CONFIGURATION  
  
The F-22 will be the US Air Force's largest fighter yet, with a  
842.4 sq. ft. wing area. All weapons are carried internally for  
stealth. Also due to the requirements of stealth, there are no  
vertical surfaces, which show up well on radar, so the fins are  
canted outward at 28 degrees. For stability, the fins will be  
very large, but not as large as those on the prototype. The sharp  
breaks or 'chines' on the sides of the nose are also due to this  
requirement.  
  
The final version will have a modified tailplane, a lower  
profile, and wings cut off at the outer trailing edge, to reduce  
the formation of vortices. It will have a leading edge sweep of  
42 degrees, as opposed to 48 degrees in the prototype. It will  
also have a lower profile and a blunter nose. There will be no  
air brake on production F-22s.  
  
The unique canopy, with no spars, will be retained, giving the F- 
22 unprecedented visibility for a fighter.  
  
The large trailing edge flaps are to be modified in shape, with  
the inboard and       outboard flaperons having constant chord  
(forward length). Together with the           leading edge flaps,  
these will form a Mission Adaptive Wing (MAW) as seen on the F-16  
and Eurofighter 2000.

TFX WEAPON SPECIFICATIONS  
  
M61B CANNON    
A modified version of General Electric's M61A1 is fitted to the  
F-22 Superstar and the Eurofighter 2000 (which is usually fitted  
with the heavier but otherwise identical 27 mm Mauser Cannon).  
Note that the F-117A has no cannon. The M61B has 1760 rounds and  
can fire high velocity 20 mm shells at 6,000 rounds per minute.  
It is suitable for both air-to-air (dogfighting) and air-to- 
ground (strafing) situations (the mode is automatically  
selected).  In dogfight mode (DGFT) the moving aiming reticle  
predicts the enemy plane position by using the aircrafts radar to  
determine speed and distance so to obtain the best probability  
for a kill.    
  
The dogfight reticle is split into 4 quarters each quarter shows  
the range of the fighter you are tracking in units of 1000 ft.  
from your aircraft.  Each quarter will broaden dependent  on the  
distance between you and the fighter.  The more broad the circle  
becomes the closer the target.  
  
In STRF mode the aiming reticle is fixed in the center of the hud  
and the area inside the ring shows the impact point of the  
cannon.

AIML AND AIM 9S SIDEWINDER    
is an infared guided missile with a short range that locks onto  
the hot gas trail left by the target aircraft.  The AIM 9L is the  
latest generation of the Sidewinder family and the seeker is  
capable of hitting the target at all aspects.  The AIM9S is  
smaller and faster and more manouverable than the SL but with a  
smaller seeker suitable for rear aspect hits.  
  
ASRAAM    
The infrared-guided Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile can  
obtain a lock on the target aircraft from any angle. It is  
intended for use in close air combat.  
  
AMRAAM    
The radar-guided Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air missile can  
lock on to an aircraft up to 29.76 miles away. The missile's so- 
called Beyond Visual Range targeting makes it a formidable  
weapon.  
  
AAAM    
A long range missile which can lock on to an aircraft up to 70

CSW    
The Conventional Stand-off Weapon is basically a CMB 18 with a  
launcher. It can be launched at long range from which it cruises  
to its target before releasing its payload.  The target or target  
area is made using the lazer target designator and the weapon  
will fly its way to the target and release its payload across an  
area.  The individual bomblettes, 250 of them per CSW, home in on  
armor and other vehicles causing large scale damage.

THE SIMULATION  
  
A simulation is a program which approximates a real situation. In  
a flight simulation, this is done by setting up the rules of  
physics and aerodynamics and treating an airplane as a set of key  
data, such as wing area, mass and so on.  
  
TFX includes a flight model which does this. The main forces  
acting on the aircraft are calculated, and added together as  
vectors, producing a resultant force vector. Like normal numbers  
(called scalars) vectors can be added to each other. They cannot  
be multiplied by each other in the normal sense, but you can  
multiply a vector by a scalar, which multiplies its magnitude,  
keeping its direction the same. Vectors are a way of using maths  
to apply to the real world, which has three dimensions.  
  
The world works according to certain laws, which were written  
down first by Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727). Newton's First Law  
states that any object will continue travelling with the same  
speed and in the same direction unless something else changes it.  
Both speed and direction can be defined by a single vector: a  
velocity vector.  
  
In TFX, your plane has a velocity vector, which only changes from  
frame to frame         due to the action of the acceleration  
vector, which changes the velocity vector in the following way:  
  
v = v + a x Dt  
  
Dt ('delta t') is a scalar, the length of time in one frame.  
Obviously, real life does not work in frames, but the smaller the  
frame time, the more accurate the calculation will be. The length  
of the time interval is determined by the speed of your machine.  
If the acceleration vector is in the same direction as the  
velocity vector, it will change the size of the velocity. If part  
or all of the acceleration vector is perpendicular (at right  
angles) to the velocity, the direction of the velocity vector  
will also be affected.  
  
To find the acceleration, Newton's Second Law is used:  
ACCELERATION = FORCE/MASS  
  
In vector terms:  
a = F / m  
  
F is the force vector, found by adding all the force vectors  
affecting the airplane end to end. There is a force vector for  
gravitational force (weight), one for aerodynamic force, one for  
thrust, and so on. A similar, but more complex set of rules are  
used in determining the angular (rotational) behavior of the  
aircraft.  
  
AERODYNAMICS  
  
FORCES  
  
The aerodynamic forces are determined by the aircraft speed V,  
air density r (rho), wing area S, and appropriate coefficients  
such as, CL or CD.  
  
Lift is the force which keeps an airplane in the air, by acting  
against gravity. Drag is the force opposite to the direction of  
travel, which Thrust, the engine force, must overcome. Because  
drag is inevitable and lift is desirable, these are the main  
aerodynamic forces.   
  
There is another aerodynamic force, sideforce, but this is  
usually small, as the aircraft is symmetrical, and sideslip angle  
b (beta) is mostly small (a few degrees), whereas angle of attack  
a (alpha) can be as high as 60 degrees in some maneuver.  
  
LIFT L = 1/2rV2 S CL  
DRAG D = 1/2rV2 S CD  
  
This is a way of looking at aerodynamic forces which shows the  
principal factors involved. For example, if everything else is  
the same, then doubling air density r will double lift and drag.  
  
For steady level flight:  
L = W  
D = T  
CL depends on wing shape, angle of attack, a, wing cross-section  
shape, and other factors (see below).  
  
MOMENTS  
  
Moment is the angular equivalent of force. The pitching moment CM  
determines rotation up or down relative to the aircraft. It is  
important, because it helps to determine angle of attack.  
  
PITCHING MOMENT M = 1/2rV2 S CM  
  
CM is determined by a, by rate of pitch, q, and by elevator  
deflection, h (eta). For stability, a positive angle of attack  
should produce a negative CM to counteract it, so if the pilot  
does not move the elevators using the joystick, the aircraft will  
pitch down again.  
  
COEFFICIENTS  
  
Although the equations above show variations of lift, drag and  
moment with the main factors, the coefficients vary in several  
ways. In addition to the variation of lift with the square of  
speed, lift coefficient CL also varies with speed and other  
factors. You might then ask what the difference is between the V2  
factor in the lift equation and the way velocity affects CL. The  
answer is simply that the coefficient is a useful way of  
comparing different wings and airplanes. The term (1/2rV2) is  
called dynamic pressure, and describes the pressure decrease when  
air travels at a certain speed. Of course, the air at different  
parts of an aircraft travels at different speeds, but V is the  
overall airspeed, and describes the general speed for purposes of  
discussion.  
  
LIFT  
As seen below, airflow over a wing generates lift because after  
the flow splits in two at the front of the wing, the shape of the  
wing causes the air over the top to travel faster in order to  
meet up with the air under the wing, as the curvature gives it a  
greater distance to travel. Even if the wing is symmetrical,  
angling it to the airflow means that the air does not split at  
the front of the wing, but on the underside, producing the same  
effect as an asymmetric ('cambered') wing.  
  
In general, the major variation of CL occurs when angle of attack  
a is changed. As seen below, at a certain angle for a given  
plane, CL is zero. As a increases, so does CL, up to a point when  
CL is highest. After this, the wing is at too high an angle for  
the air to flow smoothly from the leading edge to the trailing  
edge of the wing. It begins to 'separate' or stall, producing a  
wake of low-pressure air behind the wing. As pressure behind the  
wing is low, this pulls back on the wing, acting as drag, without  
producing any extra lift.  
  
Separation can occur unevenly on the wing, leading to unwanted  
rolling or yawing moments. So, increasing angle of attack beyond  
the stall angle is not only pointless, but dangerous.  
  
Now return to the lift equation:  
  
LIFT L = 1/2rV2 S CL  
  
Hold r and S constant for a minute, and assume that, for level  
flight, L must equal weight W. We are left with V and CL.  
Bunching the rest together:  
  
V2 CL = CONSTANT  
or:            
CL = CONSTANT/V2  
  
So, if we change one of these two variables, the other must also  
have a new value in order for the equation still to work.  
Decreasing V, we must increase CL. However, we have already  
learned that CL can only go so high before the wing stalls. So, V  
can only go so low, before you are flying along at the stall  
angle, and when you try to decrease speed further and increase a  
to get more lift, you will find that you don't get any more lift,  
and you will stall. This speed is called the stalling speed and  
is the slowest speed at which the plane can fly level.  
  
The maximum lift depends very much on the shape of the wing. Many  
airplanes use special methods to change the shape of the wings  
during flight. Two examples are shown below:  
  
The Tornado has a variable sweep (swing wing) design. At low  
speeds, the wings have a low sweep angle (they are almost at  
right angles to the airflow). This gives high lift, but produces  
more drag than the opposite setting, used at high speeds, whereby  
the wings are swept back sharply, producing lower lift and drag  
coefficients (as speed is high enough to use lower lift  
coefficients). The YF-22 uses flaps to increase lift. These  
hinged devices at the leading and trailing edges increase the  
effective camber (curvature) of the wings, producing greater  
maximum lift coefficients, again at the expense of drag.  
  
Both of these are examples of the Mission Adaptive Wing (MAW),  
the concept of in-flight adjustments to wing shape making  
airplanes more versatile. In TFX, both the F-22 and the  
Eurofighter have a leading and trailing edge flap MAW  
configuration. Both types of flap increase the stalling angle and  
maximum CL, but trailing edge flaps also increase the lift at all  
angles of attack (see below).  
  
The flight control system automatically takes care of flap  
adjustments, selecting the best settings at all speeds and  
altitudes. You can see the positions of the MAW by selecting the  
control display on one of the cockpit MFDs.  
  
The F-117A has no high lift devices of any kind, and is thus  
forced to take off and land at high speeds, and often fly at very  
high angles of attack. Luckily, the sharp sweep of the  F-117A's  
wings, and the shape of the plane's body give higher lift than  
other planes would have without flaps.  
  
DRAG  
  
Drag, on the whole, is undesirable, and most aircraft design with  
respect to drag is intended to minimize it. Sometimes, however,  
it is necessary to reduce speed, and then an increase in drag,  
sometimes using air brakes or spoilers is useful.  
There are several kinds of drag. Four important ones are Friction  
Drag, Pressure Drag, Induced Drag and Wave Drag.  
  
Friction Drag is due to the viscosity of the air passing around  
the aircraft. The friction drag coefficient remains roughly  
constant as speed increases.   
  
Pressure Drag is due to a decrease in pressure of the air as it  
passes the aircraft. Stalling causes a large pressure drop-off in  
the wake of the wings, and so pressure drag is large.  
  
Induced Drag is caused by lift. In fact, it is that part of the  
force due to circulation (the effect which causes lift) which  
acts in the direction of airflow. The higher the lift  
coefficient, the higher the induced drag. The section on control  
shows how induced drag in maneuvering limits the sustained  
maneuverability of a fighter. Using induced drag is another way  
to lose speed - by flying in a 'zig-zag' path, at high angles of  
attack, you can 'bleed off' energy.  
  
Wave Drag is due to the formation of shock waves at transonic and  
supersonic velocities. This forms the effective 'sound barrier',  
whereby the energy required to pass the speed of sound is much  
greater than that required to make a similar gain in subsonic  
speed. In a fighter, wave drag can account for perhaps 3/5 of the  
total zero-lift (non-induced) drag. Swept wings, and specially  
designed wing sections mean that today's fighters have less wave  
drag than their predecessors.   
  
Other sources of drag are external stores and landing gear. All  
of these forms of drag are simulated in TFX.  
  
SOME NOTES ON TAKEOFF  
  
In takeoff, the aim is to attain sufficient lift to leave the  
ground. For most airplanes, this is achieved by increasing the  
angle of attack (by raising the nosewheel from the ground) in  
order to increase lift. For safety's sake, takeoff speed is  
always significantly higher than stall speed, but there is  
another reason for this. When on the ground, the rolling force on  
the wheels acts not only to slow down the aircraft, but also to  
pitch the nose down. You can get the same effect, only  
exaggerated, by turning on the brakes at 60 kts. A major problem  
in shortening the takeoff distance is obtaining enough  
aerodynamic pitching moment to turn the nose skyward.  
  
Although many fighters have more thrust available than weight,  
using engines instead of wings for lift is still very  
inefficient. The Harrier is capable of vertical takeoff due to  
its thrust vectoring nozzles, but in doing so uses fuel that  
could otherwise extend range significantly. For this reason, most  
Harrier missions start with a short, but not vertical takeoff.  
The F-22 uses thrust vectoring in a different way. Instead of  
assisting the wings with engine thrust, the F-22 diverts its  
vector nozzles upward.  
  
THRUST VECTORING IN TAKEOFF  
  
The down-thrust from the F-22 engines, as well as the downward  
force from the elevators, has the effect of turning the whole  
aircraft nose-up, increasing the angle of attack and gaining  
enough lift from the large wings, with flaps deployed, to more  
than counteract the downward thrust and lift the aircraft from  
the runway. This system makes the F-22 with thrust vectoring a  
short takeoff aircraft.  
  
The Eurofighter 2000 solves the problem in a different way. In  
contrast to traditional tailplaned designs, the Eurofighter's  
foreplanes raise the nose from the ground at the same time as  
providing extra lift. As the rolling force is proportional on the  
total downward force through the wheels (i.e., weight - lift),  
this further decreases rolling force and helps the aircraft to  
get airborne.  
  
TFX simulates ground forces by treating each wheel as a separate  
system, with suspension, shock-absorption, rolling forces and  
brake forces.
