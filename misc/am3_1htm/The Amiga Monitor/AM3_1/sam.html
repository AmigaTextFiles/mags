<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>As Assistant Editor for </I>The Amiga Monitor<I>, I am compelled to apologize on behalf of our staff member who instigated this charade (and subsequently apologizes in turn, below), probably as an experiment to determine the extent to which newsgroupies will expand upon any "news" thread found in that forum.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Anyone who is concerned, or maybe even worried, about the future of our Amiga platform and who bothers to search for information must be dismayed.For many months now, the amount of misinformation, disinformation, exaggerations, lies, denials, unclear clarifications and reversals has been staggering. It seems that now that we have so many sources to read on the Internet, the worse the confusion has become. In the old days of Commodore, we only had to read two print magazines and we knew what was happening.We may not have liked all the developments but we were seldom baffled by the news we were fed.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The following is a confession.One afternoon recently I awoke from a nap to find that the word "Pindial" was in my head. I had never seen such a word before, and apparently it is not even a word, but it refused to go away.I concluded that Morpheus, or whoever is responsible for planting things in our brains while we sleep, must have had some purpose in mind for the gift of this mysterious word.So naturally I decided to share it.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In late August I posted an item in comp.sys.amiga.misc which, for the uninitiated, is the primary newsgroup for commentary, opinions and even news regarding the Amiga saga.It said simply:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Will AI remain committed to the Pindial design concept now that Joe Torre has departed?The revolutionary Pindial would surely have taken the NG Amiga far beyond other platforms and we should all be concerned about its status.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Please understand that there is not a word of truth in this posting...... totally tongue-in-cheek!However, given the current state of affairs of Amiga information it seemed sort of credible.:-)Postings in reaction to this tidbit flooded into the newsgroup including some from Amiga Inc. executives.Many postings were also tongue-in-cheek but quite a few genuinely wanted to know about this rather mysterious Pindial technology.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I subsequently embellished the intrigue by alluding to:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Pindial having been developed in the Gateway labs, not an Escom patent.
<LI>Widespread NDA's (non-disclosure agreements) signed by insiders.
<LI>An announcement that a Pindial Conference was to be held at the Amicom Show in Columbus.
<LI>Coverage of the Pindial Conference on IRC.
</OL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Postings in the Pindial thread are approaching (84) as this magazine goes to press.Only a handful were mine.I apologize for this inexcusable and nonsensical endeavor.Seems I have been reading too much garbage lately!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Pindial Rulez ;-]</P>

I heard that the Pindial design was not among the patents acquired from Escom. 
Apparently it originated in the Gateway labs where it was a tightly held secret
until recent leaks.

Errrrmmmm....

I think I've missed something here.

Please forgive my ignorance - I thought I was quite up to date with the Amiga
saga - but what on earth is Pindial?

Thank Spirit!  I was starting to feel all alone on being out of the loop on
this "pindial" stuff. =)

   I just did a quick search with four different search engines (including Agnes) and
came up with nothing.

Project Pindial is really quite simple.

You've heard of a sundial right. A device that tells time based on the
shadow the sun cast on it. Well the pindial is also a clock.

But it tell where you are in a time frame based on what is written and the
shadow it casts.

Because with a pre-emptive measurement of cronometrics it can actually warp
the time-line and solve the calculations before they are actually requested.
Sorry, can't go into more details. *BIG*(tm) NDA ((c), 1998 AInc.)  ;-)

Most likely, he was dissing the operating system that runs on the
Destination, not the Destination itself.  We all know what that "OS" is.

Obviously you missed the smiley there.

You could have at least formatted the message properly and quoted it
in the correct way.

Since you seem to know about this mysterious Pindial, why don't you
inform the rest of us, the less informed?

I'm not holding my breath though.

  They plan to rename it "Pinhead" and integrate it into Windows 2001.

hmmm, that's a difference of 57 between request and doing. A balance of
(83 - 57) 26 to the very heavy positive in doing (assuming that out of the
140 requesting information, 83 acted).

That's extreamly good. Certainly over 50% active response. In direct
marketing getting a 10% active response is considered doing very well, a
sure thing.

If this where market testing results..... I hope your sitting down and
strapped in when you realize what it means. Especially when you add the
twist of consumer direct marketing and support. For you are in for the
ride of your life. Are you ready for the G-forces and do you have your
oxygen tanks ready to go?

    Can you re-read this and then re-write it so it means something?

Are you trying to say...."If this were market testing results.....
and....what... what does it mean... I've taught English before and some 8th
graders write like this and trying to decipher the main SUBJECT of the
sentence is sometimes hard,... What does it mean TIM?  You end up your
statement with a question, but what is it we're waiting for?  What ride of

  I am quoting Tim Rue's post above, and asking him to clarify his broken
English to make some sense of his post....... Guess the question was too hard

Timmy boy is on crack.  If you read the Disclaimer on his WWW page, it

The Pindial is a 5 ton rapidly spinning steel disc with long sharp
spikes, commissioned by the customer support division of BLAZEMONGER INC,
for as of yet undisclosed purposes.

It's not really a secret; anyone may read in on Pindial at
BLAZE://BLAZEMONGER.BLAZE on the term that they commit suicide
immediately after seeing it.

You must be either:

1.  Spam professional.
2.  Newbie.
3.  Someone with some secret who can't sleep on it.

Please, either explain to us what this Pindial is, or stop this
propaganda.

Which early testing?
Once you said it was dropped, then you said it will be explained in
Amicom, now you talk about early testing and claim that there is some
sort of emulation?

What's next?
I sure hope that you're not posting during these "early testing" of
yours, because if you did, then this "technology" doesn't handle 
CAP LOCKS. :-)

Pindial was originally an attempt by someone to make a joke based on the AInc
announcements.

At the time it was amusing, but now it is, like all jokes which are over-used,
nothing short of annoyingly boring.

So there you have it.

Pindial was originaly a joke posting, only some bozzo (mentioning no names but
he is the sort of person who finds it teribly funny to post in caps only) who
can't let a joke lie, insists on trying to use the same old Pindial joke over
and over again.

Oh well, I suppose it keeps him amused, which is something...

Fleecy Moss got a new baby. "Fortunately" it is not compatible
with classic amigas, but it surely has sound, great graphics and
even taste and smell included !

The name of this project is not MMC nor amigaNG nor pindial, but
Evie for short !

Nice to see that the employees of Amiga Inc. are producing something
worthwhile!

LEARN NOT TO LEAVE UNQUOTED MESSAGES IN YOUR POSTS.

And hey that's what spammers need when they post like your post,
attention is what they seek.

I can't believe nobody has noticed that "PINDIAL" spelled backwards ('lai
d'nip') is  "fire spreader" in Swahili.  An obvious ruse.  Not many Bantu
Amiga users on the internet, I guess.

SURE JUST INCLUDE A CAPS LOCK EMULATION ROUTINE, AND YOU'RE ALL
SET.:-)

ENOUGH !

P.S. Please post in normal way like the rest 99.99% of USENET users,
if you're trying to drag attention in this way, I'm afraid you have
chosen the wrong style.

Also fix the line length in Internet news as you quoting is simply a
pain to read.

*yawn*

Give it a rest, bozo.

It may have been mildly amusing once, but your repeated postings to csam with
the same old "pindial" bollocks is now just tediously boring.

Or, if you really cannot manage to survive without posting regularly to
perpetuate the already overused joke, then please at least learn how to type
using lowercase letters.

*sigh*

(What is it about csam that seems to attract nutters these days?  First we had
LUser/Qwerty/EAL, then RueBot, and now Mr Pindial.  Whatever next??!!)
