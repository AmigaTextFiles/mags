<UL>
<LI>Being an AM staff member, while not a huge commitment, is also not a commitment to be taken lightly. Staff members are expected to produce on a regular basis, at least three times per year.
<LI>The privilege of publishing purely editorial (opinion-based) writing is extended to staff members only. Others looking to express their opinions are welcome to write to <A HREF="feedback.html">Feedback</A>.
<LI>It is ultimately at the discretion of the staff of The Amiga Monitor as to whether articles will be published.
</UL>
