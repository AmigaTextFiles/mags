<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Introduction by Michael Webb:</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The question has been floating around for years. Will there ever be an Amiga version of the America Online software? Most have said no, and pointed out our extreme minority status. Things are changing, however, and the Amiga may once again become a major name, and such issues as AOL may become worthy of reconsideration.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In AM, you first saw the issue raised by Sam Ormes several months ago, by way of an editorial which was subsequently given its own link on the Amiga Web Directory. There has been some response, and various discussions among AM staff members have taken place.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Nobody can pretend to know the wishes of the community, however. As a result, Contributing Editor Paul Somerfeldt put together a survey, as given below.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">How to fill out the Survey</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We would like as many people with opinions on the subject as possible to participate in this poll. If you choose to do so, send an e-mail message to Paul Somerfeldt at <A HREF="mailto:p.somerfeldt@genie.com">p.somerfeldt@genie.com</A> including the information requested below (one entry per person, please). Paul will then reply to acknowledge having received your message.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At this time, we intend to post an update on the status of the poll with each issue of AM, and the poll will run throughout 1998, with all entries due by December 31 (12-31-1998). However, the sooner everybody responds, the sooner we can influence things, if it is possible to do so at all.</P>
