Two Large Magazines fold and still there is more Bad News for August! Surely Not?

Vulcans, D.S.P. Development Team responsible for the Amiga CDRom title
'Almagica Scions of a Forgotten World' have decided to cease all development of
the title due to the economic realities of the Amigas constantly eroding user base. 

Vulcans, Black Flag Development Team responsible for the Amiga CDRom title
'Caveman Species' have decided to cease development of the Amiga version due
to the economic realities of the Amigas constantly eroding user base.

Live as Long as you can & Prosper!
