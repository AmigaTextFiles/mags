CU Amiga Magazine Closes
From: Tony Horgan (tony.horgan@ecm.emap.com)
Editor, CU Amiga Magazine

(13 Aug 1998 17:48:55)  It is with great regret that I have to inform you
that the October 1998 issue of CU Amiga will be the last ever published. CU
Amiga Magazine recently dipped into a state of unprofitability, from which
it looked unlikely to emerge. The decision to close the magazine was taken
by EMAP in light of the magazine's overall financial performance and the
lack of prospects for any immediate or short term recovery.
   It is ironic that CU Amiga should close as the world's best selling Amiga
magazine, but recently its financial returns have started to outweigh its
overheads. While it has been customary for costs to be cut in order to stave
off the closure of magazines, it was decided that CU Amiga would be laid to
rest without suffering the indignities of having half its pages removed and
the remaineder printed on toilet paper in black and white. Neither will it
be sold off to another company to be published on a shoe string and run into
the ground.
   The CU Amiga editorial team were obviously very sorry to hear the news
and would like to pass on their sincere thanks to everyone who has helped
make CU Amiga such a success and so much fun to work on over its many years
of existence.
   Further details can be found on the CU Amiga website:

[Information on Amiga Format: (14 Aug 1998 09:03:50 GMT) Okay, I'm sorry to
reply to you all in this way, but I'm getting so many emails on this topic I
just have to. AF is in a much better financial situation than CU is, was or
has been for a long time. I'm sorry to see them go too, but the simple fact
of the matter is that we are here and we intend to be here for a long time
yet. However, now, more than ever, the Amiga market is in the hands of its
users. Without people buying software (whether it be commercial or
shareware) and hardware we will soon join CU in magazine heaven...

All the best,
