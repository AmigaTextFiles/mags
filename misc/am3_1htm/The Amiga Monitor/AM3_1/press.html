<B>Interview with Vulcans Marble-Eyes Development Team</B>
Subj:	 Interview
Date:	98-08-15 15:20:08 EDT
From:	Paul@vul-soft.demon.co.uk (Paul Carrington)

Hello Amiga Press of the World!

If this kind of thing interest you then please find below a Generic Interview with
Vulcans Marble-Eyes Development Team for any kind of publication.



Interview with Vulcans Marble-Eyes Development Team
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I remember downloading a preview of Genetic Species from Aminet made by
Ambrosia and now you are called Marble-Eyes what has happened?

MeD: Our full name is Marble-eyes Development. Our game started as a good
demo effect, but at this point our coder was more or less alone on this project and a
member of the demogroup called Ambrosia. The Genetic Species engine was first
shown the Gathering96 in Norway and got a lot of positive criticism. After this event
the other members in Ambrosia seem to care more about other demo productions,
and the coder was therefore forced into an alternative arrangement of finding
someone to do the job. 

Finally a very talented graphician reply an e-mail and process began to speed up.
Later on Martin Halberg our audioman joined the team and our demo effect began to
look a lot more like a game. We all decided to leave behind the demo scene and
concentrate on game development, therefore it seem natural to restart under a new
name.

Q: When did Vulcan Software get into the picture?

MeD: The demo from the Gathering96 was put on Aminet and downloaded by
Vulcan. They liked it and saw potential in it's concept so they contacted us and a
contract was signed on 1st of December 1996.

Q: Try to describe Genetic Species using 50 words.

MeD: Based on Paradroid this game offers furiously invigorating and thrilling 3d
action with an amount of details not seen on the Amiga for along time. Lots of
puzzles, atmosphere and gameplay. 200 MB intro animation, 30 mins of CD music
and 29000 lines of optimised
68k assembler.

Q: 46 words that's close ;). The Amiga has seen many doom clones, is there
anything new about your game?

MeD: The speed, the playability, the atmosphere and support for everything worth a
mention. Not at least your unique ability (and need) to take over the bodies of
humans, cyborgs and droids, which has proven to work very well in a 3d
environment. We believe it is unfair to call GS for a doom clone. In fact we use the
3d environment as a platform to build an adventure game. Imagine the year 2034
you startup your big virtual reality machine and enters a cyberspace with no
boundaries. Would you say: "awesome doom clone man!"

Q: Why do you think Genetic Species is better than other 3d games.?

MeD: GS features a original plot that is well combined with the story and gameplay.
The plot in the game is not just for decoration. Once you start playing a weak and
twisted story line begins to unfold. Shooting every thing that moves will get you
nowhere and that gives Genetic Species the edge.

Q: Tell us a secret no one outside Marble-eyes knows!

MeD: We are aliens from Alpha Centauri and have made plans to rule the world
before the millennium.

Q: What can we expect from Marble-eyes in the future?

MeD: Well, we are here to stay! Our motivation and passion for computer science 
continues and we have big plans for Genetic Species before we start on another
game. First up is a multiplayer AddOn with TCP/IP support. This means that you will
be able to play over the internet. We hope to create the first useful internet game for
the Amiga, if not Mr. Burkey beats us there. However this multiplayer AddOns will be
infected with all sort of pirate protections something we didn't have time to do on the
CD-ROM. With 4 years of demo coding experience and reverse engineering of
demos I should be able to give the cracker and good headache and at the time this
AddOn is cracked a new one is out.

Q: Speaking of piracy. How is Genetic Species doing?

MeD: We haven't done anything to prevent piracy yet, but the size of the game is
more than 600 MB which makes a natural limit for BBS/Internet piracy. Still there are
jerks out there who rather will spent two days online than to support the future of the
Amiga. However most people are supporting an Amiga specific game. An issue our
sales at the WOA show outlined in style!

Live Long & Prosper!

            Also read the News Archive.
A Letter to the Amiga Community from Amiga Head of Marketing, Bill McEwen

 I would like to take a moment and thank those of you who brought
to my attention the Sacramento Bee article that was recently printed.
I have answered you directly, and for those of you who were able to
attend the AmiWest show in Sacramento you know that the quotes are
not our plan.

 We are not only targeting greatness, but we are moving towards greatness.

 I mentioned at the Sacramento show that I would make the
presentation of slides available to ALL of the Amiga community from
our web site, and we are in process of achieving this task.

 I am concerned, however, that the information in these slides
could be misused and abused. I am asking that the Amiga community use
this information for internal purposes only. We consider each and
every one of you a member of the Amiga team, and are hopeful that you
will honor the request to keep this communication within the Amiga
Community.

 We will have an area where those of you interested will need to
"sign" for a copy of the presentation before you can access the
presentation. This is a way for us to know who has a copy, and know
that they are not going to misuse the information.

 The sign-up page will be posted no later than August 19, 1998.
Come back to this page then to sign up to receive your copy of the
presentation.

 I thank each of you for your continued support, and look forward
to delivering the promise.

 If you should have any questions then please do not hesitate in
contacting me directly at billm@amiga.com.

Thank you,

Bill McEwen



Please do not abuse this. Bill asked us at AmiWest to stay below the
radar and promised us info if we would.

<B>Nova Design Releases ImageFX 3.2 Upgrade
</B>
For Immediate Release

Nova Design, Inc., producers of the award winning ImageFX package and the highly received Aladdin 4D package, are proud to announce the exciting version 3.2 upgrade to ImageFX! ImageFX has been the required graphics application for all Amiga owners and has been a part of Video Toaster/Flyer owner's toolkits for years. Combining painting, image file format conversion, image processing, and special effects, ImageFX is the undisputed leader in graphics manipulation on the Amiga. 

When ImageFX 3.0 was released, it brought the first implementation of real image layers compositing technology to the Amiga. This came with a vastly enhanced user interface, larger previews, multiple image windows, faster redraws, and child menus. Photoshop file format import and exporting was added and the ability to work directly with color-mapped (CMAP) images! ImageFX, true to its name, also added new effects such as Pagecurler, plasma Clouds, particle pixel Scatter, image Splash, and the amazing FXForge for creating hundreds of new effects. 

Highlights of the new ImageFX 

The newest release of ImageFX is version 3.2. This release has virtually eliminated any reported problems experienced by users in previous releases and has added many new features as well. 

The new features include support for more BMP and JPEG image file subformats, support for images saved from the Brilliance paint program, and minor updates to the IMP batch processor for ImageFX. Many new Arexx commands have been added as well, a new control has been added to the Layer Manager, and for owners of pressure sensitive drawing tablets ImageFX now supports pressure in the airbrush painting tool. Major work was also done to enhance the operation of ImageFX's region masks as well! 

Support for older Hewlett Packard SCSI Scanjet models was added along with many overall enhancements to this module, which include better previews. The Epson scanner module has been improved, but development of support for the Epson Perfection 600 model was dropped when Epson discontinued this model. 

Ordering the Upgrade 

The best news of all is that owners of ImageFX 3.0 through 3.1c can download a free patch to upgrade to ImageFX 3.2 from the Nova Design, Inc. FTP site at ftp://ftp.novadesign.com/pub/imagefx/Official_Upgrades at any time. The patch is also available on diskettes for $10 plus shipping. ($5 in the continental US, $10 elsewhere) 

Upgrades from the older ImageFX 2.0 through 2.6 releases is only $79.95 plus shipping. Versions of ImageFX prior to 2.0 can be upgraded for only $124.95 plus shipping. 

You can order via 1-800-IMAGE-69 in the US and Canada or call (804) 282-1157 elsewhere. Orders can also be faxed to (804) 282-3768 or mailed to the Nova Design, Inc., 1910 Byrd Avenue, Suite 204, Richmond, VA 23230 USA, Attention: Upgrades 

ImageFX is also available new, worldwide, through your local Amiga dealer or via mail order at a suggested retail price of $349.95 US.

<B>CU-Amiga, its closure and the Amiga's future</B>
Subj:	 CU-Amiga, it's closure and the Amiga's future
Date:	98-08-18 03:19:08 EDT

Sender:	owner-tamiga@ninemoons.com

Fellow Amigans.

Foreword
Before you read this I would like to state that the information
contained within this posting is as accurately truthful as possible
and I consider my sources to be honest and true.

In short, unless later stated different, the information that follows is
as near accurate as it's humanly possible.

Whilst the news of the closure of CU-Amiga has hit some of us badly,
all is not doom and gloom - the news is actually very positive.
                                                                               

*****************************

CU-AMIGA.  Whilst CU-Amiga was actually the biggest selling Amiga
magazine, 
(60% market share) it wasn't the most profitable. (more on that soon) 
Basically in the recent months CU-Amiga dipped slightly below profitability
twice and EMAP publishing decided to pull the plug rather than to try to
see if it could turn it's fortunes around.

Also the fact that CU-Amiga's Advertising rates were 1/3 cheaper than
Amiga Format, probably didn't help.

Bear in mind that Emap is mainly a women's magazine publisher it only
has approx five computing titles, CU-Amiga, playstation Internet
magazine  amongst others. 
With computing titles making up a small amount of the companies 
output, it could be argued that perhaps they are looking to get out of
the computing market altogether and that CU-Amiga may be the first of
the 'casualties' - although this is mere speculation on my part. 

The CU-Amiga staff, are now sadly without employment (nowhere in Emap for them to go.)
I hope someone else picks them up -  They are amigans through and through.   

Please bear in mind that Emap is in business like any other publisher
and may have decided that they have to show the shareholders that
they were determined to not waste any of their money on a floundering
title.

*****************************

AMIGA FORMAT the second biggest selling Amiga title of the two with 
only 40% of the market. Published by Future Publishing whom publish
16  other computer magazines. 

Amiga Format is Trading in PROFIT!!! 
Of the 16 computing titles that Future publish Amiga Format is well
above several of them in profitability.

The Management of Amiga Format have assured Amiga Format that they
have  got the go ahead for another year of publishing. They are also
quite confident that they will be able to extend this.

Hopefully to see in the New Amiga and beyond.

As a result of CU-Amigas closure, there has been an increase of
Advertising revenue at Amiga Format and this will lead to the
INCREASE of pages in the magazine. (From about 108 now, to 124 or 130
pages) 

These will be made up from a mixture of extra advertising and extra
features/articles.

*******************************

I have also taken the liberty this afternoon of speaking to the 
key Amiga Players in the UK from developers, publishers and 
retailers here's what they said. 

(Note it makes very positive reading)

Active Technologies
"Yes, we are continuing on the Amiga and are also developing new
software to be unveiled at Colgne'98"

Alive Mediasoft: 
"We are staying. Alive mediasoft is EXPANDING we are taking people
on and we will be the LAST People standing on the Amiga if
Necessary. We are committed to the Amiga 100%"

Blittersoft
"Business as usual - we will carry on supporting the Amiga"

Chroma
"Yes, we will continue supporting the Amiga for the time being"

Epic Marketing
"We are staying with the Amiga Platform, We are increasing our
Advertising in Amiga Format and will be producing more advertising
 flyers." 

Eyetech 
"Absolutely continuing to support the Amiga - No question."

Fore-Matt Home computing: 
"We will continue supporting the Amiga and very much so. we are 
increasing our advertising revenue on the Amiga and we are committed to
the Amiga 100%"

Power Computing
"We will continue to support the Amiga, it remains the most profitable
platform in our product range making up 70% of our income. We have also
recently increased our advertising budget as well"

White Knight Technologies
"No change for us we remain committed to the Amiga Platform but we
will be increasing our direct mailings to our customers and also
increase our DTV business"

Weird Science 
"Debating" (but I think they will stay)


Wizard Developments.
"No change - business as usual"

*****************************************

There you have it, take this and publish it anywhere were you think 
it will be useful. 

Tell people the Amiga is not dead, all the people I have spoken were 
very positive about the Amiga's future. 

Many Skeptics will say that retailers and developers would convey a
positive message so as to not deter potential customers.

However they forget that most of these retailers and developers
are Amigans and they are going to stick with the Amiga through thick
and thin
 
An Excellent Magazine has gone but it's not the Amiga's Fault, After
all if Amiga Format (with less circulation can be profitable) then you
have to look at the way the advertising rates were being charged at
CU-Amiga.

Also many Amigans have complained about the difficulty in obtaining
the Magazine in certain parts of the uk/rest of the World. (something
which can at best be discribed as patchy)

We are now left with one Truly international Amiga Magazine,
Amiga Format, Please get behind them and Support them all the way!

<B>JForth Web Site Bursts Forth</B>

From:	marrandy@tampabay.rr.com (Martin)

Press Release - For Immediate Release
News Date - 23:00 Hr. EST - Monday 31st August 1998 
News Source - Martin Randall  - JForth Project maintainer -
(JForth-Admin@ChaosSolutions.com)

JForth Web site bursts Forth  - 931 JForth downloads - JForth
Documentation programme
- Announcement mailing list !!!

Following the exciting release of JForth freeware on the 10th August
1998, we are now
proud to announce the availability of the JForth web site at
Http://home.tampabay.rr.com/jforth/

This site is under-going continuous daily updating !

In the 21-days since the JForth release (10th August 1998), the primary
download site at
Http://www.softsynth.com/jforth has had 931 downloads of JForth. The
temporary ftp site
at ftp.calweb did not have tracking information and is now closed. The
unknowns are the
calweb site and duplicates people have made so the actual number is
probably a lot higher.


Due to problems with  Rich Text Formatting  (RTF)  compatibility issues,
we have
re-assessed the situation. The result is the JForth Documentation
Project  (JDP).

It’s first success is the release of the major sections of the JForth
manual on-line (see web
page)  in HTML format (the Glossary will be completed this week).

More conversions of the JForth manual will follow during the month of
September.


In addition to the general mailing list 
mailto:MDaemon@ChaosSolutions.com  with 
‘subscribe JForth-list’ as the only line in the body, an announcement
mailing list has been
created.

This is for people who don’t have time to start JForth at the moment,
but want to be kept
informed of Press Releases and other major JForth announcements. Please
NOTE:- This
list is for announcements only. You CANNOT post to this list !

To join, send a mail to mailto:MDaemon@ChaosSolutions.com   with  
‘subscribe
JForth-Announce’  in the body.


Many projects are presently being formed and new developments and
announcements are
expected shortly.

<B>PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX joins RegNet</B>

05.09.1998 

PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX just has joined RegNet - The Registration Network:

                        http://www.reg.net

  Several of our separate programs and bundles now can be ordered
  online by using credit cards and other paying servives as
  offered by Regnet.

  HOWEVER YOU STILL CAN ORDER DIRECTLY FROM US.

  RegNet can accept nearly all kinds of payment. They take the following credit
  cards: MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Novus (Discover). For high ticket
  items (over $150) they can issue an invoice against a purchase order for
  payment by check or credit card. They also accept money orders or checks
  (payable to Wintronix or RegNet).

  If you don't have a credit card, RegNet can accept cash, check or money order.
  Be sure to include all of your contact information with your payment. Make
  checks (drawn on a US bank) payable to RegNet and send to the following
  address:

             RegNet (Wintronix, Inc.)
             24303 Walnut Street, Suite 200
             Newhall, CA 91321-2900
             U.S.A.

        RegNet can be reached on the World Wide Web at the following URL:
                           http://www.reg.net
        or by calling 1 800 WWW2REG (1 800 999-2734) or (805) 288-1827.


  The following packages/bundles currently are available:

       SViewII                              27 USD  (20+7)    keyfile
       SViewII PPC modules                  27 USD  (20+7)    binaries
       akJFIF/akPNG bundle                  27 USD  (20+7)    keyfile
       PNG-Box                              27 USD  (20+7)    keyfile
   (1) SViewII, akPNG/akJFIF bundle         42 USD  (33+9)    keyfiles
   (2) SViewII + PPC, akPNG/akJFIF bundle   58 USD  (47+11)   keyfiles, binaries
       (1) + PNG-Box                        61 USD  (50+11)   keyfiles
       (2) + PNG-Box                        77 USD  (64+13)   keyfiles, binaries


  In the brackets you see that I had to increase the prices by the
  costs that Regnet takes from me (10 percent of the price plus 5 USD).
  Note, that this isn't a fee taken for credit card payment, but a
  fee resulting out of the fact that RegNet has to be paid for its service.

  However, you save the costs and the risk of shipping the money via
  snail mail to me, the expensive costs to do postal money orders
  and so on. Also, by chosing a bundle, you still may save some money.
  We, on the other hand, have to pay additional fees for cashing
  the american cheques Regnet will send us - so, it's fair.

  Shipment always takes place via eMail, no media will be sent.

Hi,

 it seems some of the entries for www.reg.net got screwed up
 while entering the database. I've asked RegNet to fix
 this. Attached you find a corrected list plus the
