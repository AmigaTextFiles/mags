<HR>




<P ALIGN="LEFT">After we had been publishing The Amiga Monitor for some time, a fundamental problem with magazines became apparent.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It may not be obvious in the "here and now," but old issues of magazines remain exactly the way they are after publication. They are not updated, errors are not fixed, etc. This is especially true of an online magazine, which anybody can stumble upon long after it was created. Results can include invalid e-mail addresses and broken hypertext links.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In order to minimize this problem, beginning with the February 1998 (Volume 2 Issue 7) issue of The Amiga Monitor, we have assembled a central "switching station," if you will, to which this, and all future issues of AM, should refer. In theory, this station will remain in place indefinitely, and continue to provide up-to-date e-mail addresses equally indefinitely.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As publisher, I have chosen my web site, <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/">The Webb Site, http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/</A>, as host.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">AM Link Redirection Page</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The AM Link Redirection Page will exist at the URL <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/HomePages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html</A>. There, you should be able to find contact information for people associated with The Amiga Monitor, e-mail addresses for various AM departments or services, and links to AM-affiliated sites.</P>


<BR><BR>


<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Limitations</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The AM Link Redirection Page will exist at http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html for as long as I retain my CompuServe account. I intend to do so more or less indefinitely, but there is no guarantee, and CompuServe itself may one day cease to exist. However, this is the best solution available given the circumstances at hand, and should greatly facilitate any needed future admiministrative changes at AM.</P>
