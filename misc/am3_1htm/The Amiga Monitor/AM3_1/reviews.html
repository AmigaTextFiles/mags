<HR>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you have a product you would like us to review at The Amiga Monitor, please contact us at e-mail address <A HREF="mailto:kylewebb@aol.com (AM Product Reviews)">kylewebb@aol.com</A> (please check the <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html">AM Link Redirection Page</A> for an up-to-date e-mail address first if possible, but otherwise use this address). We will then put a member of our staff in contact with you if we have somebody whose knowledge and interests are appropriate for the product to be reviewed.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At that point, central AM administration is no longer directly involved until the review is published. Reviews are therefore done at the company's risk, and AM will not be held accountable in any way for any dissatisfaction on the part of the company whose product is being reviewed.</P>
