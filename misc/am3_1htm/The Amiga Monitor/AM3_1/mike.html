<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Partly cloudy" has many possible meanings. First, let me say that I have been insanely busy lately. There has been almost no time to work on this magazine, which is why it's somewhat late. I must admit that my mood about having to throw this issue together quickly is cloudy at best.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Partly cloudy" might also refer to the state of Amiga users' attitudes about the platform. Or about the future of developers. The list goes on.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But I'm going to keep things short for this month. I'll just leave you with a greeting from my new location, where I've put this column for the sake of streamlining the magazine.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We'll see you next month. Maybe we'll catch some pleasant weather for a change.</P>
