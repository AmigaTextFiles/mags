<B><I>"Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends..."</I></B>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hi, folks, and welcome back to SHOWTIME!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some of you may recognize the opening line as shamelessly lifted from Emerson, Lake and Palmer's <I>Brain Salad Surgery</I> (oh, now I <I>am</I> dating myself). Take a minute, if you would, <I>right now</I>, and check this link: <A HREF="http://dynrec.com/elp/">http://dynrec.com/elp/</A>...YES! IT'S WORTH THE TRIP! Just to "get you in the mood"...! But, do come back, because ..."...the show's about to start!"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It seemed a good idea at the inception of this highly time-consuming, research-intensive series to express my feelings in regards to the longevity and staying power of the Classic Amiga (that's what AI is calling your "Miggy", folks...makes me wonder, not unlike the New Coke / Classic Coke hype / fiasco of years past, will the public accept the New Formula? UH OH...those sentiments belong in another article! Sorry....) But I digress...and what I meant to say (so long as I don't get distracted by other issues) is this: it matters not what the publication staff, or the Amiga-loyal public feels about recent developments in the Amiga theoretical-soon-to-be-line...there are <I>five</I> Amigas in this house, six total for the household: three A500's, an A1000, an A1200, plus the Traveling Tower (we sent it to Engineering school; smart computer); I should think that would indicate a willingness and faith. Or, an obsession  :) BUT: <I>Shows such as Midwest, or last month's AmiWest 98, have supported users such as ourselves here at </I>The Amiga Monitor. <I>If ANYone is keeping the Amiga fires lit, and providing a continuity for the Faithful, it is those people who work hard to assemble these events, and those who dedicate themselves to producing in multiple and myriad venues for the established line of Classic Amigas. From developers to the hard-working press people...</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"></I>That, folks, is why I decided to parcel an enormous amount of my time to SHOWTIME!. The developers who *are* the show, and the producers who *make* the show, deserve all the support we can give them. Without them, our machine of choice would have been landfilled long ago. Credit where credit is due.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">That was the Editorial portion of this article. We move on, now, to something of a compilation of News. <---(that was a disclaimer  :)</P>


<HR>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">This month, I am concentrating my efforts into the Midwest Amiga Exposition, being held Friday, Saturday and Sunday, October 2nd, 3rd, and 4th (1998) at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, 350 North High Sreet, Columbus, Ohio. I first did a brief on the event in the May issue of The Amiga Monitor (http://www.cucug.org/amiga/amiinfo/monitor/am2_10htm/showtime.htm) when the show was beginning to surface in the news communities this year. The gentleman with whom I have had the most contact from AmiCON (The Amiga Central Ohio Network) in regards to the growing details of MAE-98, Dave Pearce, tells me this is the third year for the event,<I> with attendance and exhibition figures in the second year *double* that of the first.</I> There are indications that this year will eclipse last: a mini-quote seems appropriate at this time....</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"....in fact, the longer this goes on, the better it seems to get!" - Dave Pearce</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The official website, a link to which can be found in the banner at the top of this page, is an evolving organism, delightfully redesigned by Pantheon Systems. Who, you say, is Pantheon Systems? Well, I asked the same question...and the answer to that, and nearly any question you could think of regarding Midwest, can be easily found within the following press release or the highly navigable, highly informative website. (I only pestered Dave Pearce for a "few" tidbits, and to his credit, he did most graciously respond to every one of my inquiries. Thanks, Dave...) Check the floor space (TRIPLE that of last year!!......making MAE-98 the <U>LARGEST</U> US show (in terms of floor space; but it's going quickly, reserve your spot NOW), check the prices (it's GOOD to be a CUCUG member....) and while you're at their website, check in with MapQuest (a neat place to bookmark) and see just  exactly how to get to the show, and how long it'll take you to do so. (Eleven and a half hours, five hundred miles, for me...) So, without further delay:</P>

AmiCON has increased show floor for the 1998 Midwest Amiga Expo to 8,500 square feet, almost triple that of last years event!

Don't miss out on your chance to help the local Amiga organizations grow and expand! 

Along with the most prominent Amiga companies and seminars, the 98 Midwest Amiga Expo also offers special events for attendees such as the Special Interest Group Gatherings (SIGGs). The SIGGs will take place on Saturday night, after the show floor closes, at one of the premier hot spots in Columbus, Jillians, right across the street from the show. The SIGGs will consist of groups like Graphics, Internet and others headed by industry leaders who will meet to discuss the latest topics among good food, drinks, and fantastic atmosphere. Take advantage of this opportunity to discuss the latest trends, rumors, and developments in the Amiga community. Signups for the SIGGs will be available during the day at the Expo.

<B><I>Shedding light on the User Group Network:
</B></I>
About the Amiga User Group Network (http://www.amiga.org/usergroups/)

<I>Purpose</I>

The UGN serves several functions to the Amiga community. The primary function is the Amiga User Group Database which will provide information about User Groups to the public. With the information in the database we are able to direct information straight to the User Groups, the heart of the Amiga community. We also wish to help User Groups and assist them in what ever way we can. 

(As details are available we shall post a notice in the news section). The second service we will offer is a simple network which will be the backbone of the communication system to the User Groups

(Details below). 
 
<I>Basic Structure</I>

The communication part of the UGN is totaly transparent to the User Groups (except for the communication point ;-)).

The UGN is based around a pyramid type shape with multiple levels from top to bottom. Each level can be altered to meet the needs of the situation. The Top level is the International Management level, this is where information is either received by Amiga Inc or dispatched to the users. The Middle level is National Management level. This is where counties are administered by way of an administration group per country whose size would be determined by situation. The final level is the User Group Level where the information is gathered from users or announced. This is only a basic example of the structure, there are multiple factors to consider in this plan before each level or communication can be understood fully. We reserve the right to change this at anytime.

<I>Example Communication Models</I>

There is more than one way for the information to be transmitted through the network, however depending on what the need is, methods can be changed.

A Highend method would be that information is transmitted from all levels both downward and upward information. This would require high amounts of bandwidth for all levels, to allow the large amounts of information to flow. This method provides high control but far more time involved in the processing of information and transmission.

An alternative to this is to retain the Highend structure, but make the information from Amiga to User Group and Amiga to National level available on a public site which would eliminate half the traffic. Of course the levels would be required for upward flow.

The highend downward flow could be used when a special purpose is required such as press releases to national newspapers and media. 
 

<I>Advantages</I>

•Provides Amiga a quick and efficient link to its users to make a truly user orientated company.
•Surveys can be run and results available fast, representing a large proportion of the Amiga population.
•By making the user more included, they will keep their faith in the company during the wait for updates.
•General feedback can be directed to Amiga Inc, including bug reports on beta software.
•Updates such as new SetPatch's and FileSystem's can be distributed to most of the Amiga community providing a better general base to develope for. 



If you have some questions, please mail us and we will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Please note that changes, additions and other important information will be mentioned on the UGN news page.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">What's the dinner menu for Saturday night at the Hyatt? If you believe some of the reader response, one might get the impression that I chew up and spit out Amigas for breakfast   :) Au conraire, an' all that. Nobody who dedicates the amount of time that I do, particularly in a volunteer fashion, could possibly be anything BUT faithful. I have a lot of company in that respect; personally, I have no real contact with any individuals who are making Big Money off The Machine. But I have a great deal of communications with remarkable people with incredible staying power, without the motivation of monetary gain. In today's society especially, I have an enormous amount of respect for these folks.</P>
