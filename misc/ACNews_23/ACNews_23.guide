                                 VOYAGER 3 NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Oliver 'owagner' Wagner

The mysterious message from the 14th and the general silence regarding V3
although I kind-of announced a V3.3 warrants a explanation.

Nope, it's not Alina keeping me from work, or me and Claudi trying to setup
another baby.

What has happened -- and still is happening -- is that V3 got a complete new
layout engine, written from scratch.

This originated in a discussion I had with Jon 'Sircus' Bright of Silicon
Circus, in which I was constantly moaning about how horrible the current layout
implementation in V3 would be, how hard it is to locate and fix even minor
quirks, and how good it would be to rewrite it from scratch, doing it all much
better, based on the know-how gained with the current implementation.

He generally just kept saying "Why don't you do it, then?", and, after I spent
several hours finding and eliminating a quirk related to table cell borders, it
finally sank in, and I bagan to ditch the old implementation.

There are several reasons why the old engine was "bad" from a programmer's point
of view even if it does not look that bad at the user level.

First, it's basic design concept still originated in the flat HTML 2.0 layouting
code which I wrote in early 1995, without any concepts of frames, tables,
Javascript, DHTML or style sheets.

The layouter was completely stateless, and could not do any incremental
processing. That V3 *seems* to be able to layout incrementally is in fact just
careful selection of which areas are rerendered when new data arrives -- the
actual internal representation of the HTML page was always rebuild from scratch.

This is not only slow, but brought in many additional problems with Javascript.
Javascript is a OO language, and does not expect objects to suddenly vanish and
reappear with different memory addresses just because new data from a largish
page arrived. There were many kludges to work around this in the current
release, some of them tend to not work properly.

There was no clear distinction between *parsing* HTML (i.e. reading tags and
creating objects out of them) and *layouting* (placing those objects on screen)
-- it was all done in one place. So, when new data arrived, instead of simply
parsing the new data only, adding it to the existing object tree, and then doing
a layout run, it all had to be done from scratch. The same was true when the
container width of the layout space changed -- in laymen terms, when one resized
V's window.

There was also no proper recursive implementation of table layouting. When
hitting a table, V used to parse and layout the underlying HTML code three times
(to get the minimum and maximum sizes, to get the heights, and a final run to
actually create objects of this). This generally does work, but requires 3
complete runs over the contents of a table -- which is bad when the table
contained another table, because then the inner table parsed it's contents 3*3=9
times, and a even more nested tables 3*3*3=27 times... you can probably guess
why V tends to slow down so heavily on deeply nested tables. In the real world,
this was not that bad, because V would have cached min/max sizes of tables and
reuse them properly. However, when carefully "designing" a web page with many
nested tables with unspecified widths, it was possible to effectivly render the
cache useless -- www.freshmeat.net is a good example of this.

All this was known for a long time, and I often had considered to drop this
implementation in favour of a new one. Up to now, however, I always hesitated to
replace this core functionality, out of fear that it would take more time than
what could be justified. Instead, I kept optimizing the underlying primitives of
the parsing/layouting process (HTML tag scanning, text width calculation etc.).

Well, that's all history now.

I've been working on the new code for about a month now, and it's near usability
now.

And what usability -- layout is now blazingly fast (even freshmeat's HTML from
hell goes through in tenth of a second, instead of tens of seconds), resizing
V's window is instantious, a proper OO design of the underlying objects makes
long-missing stuff like <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT|RIGHT> magically work as-is.

I'm going to release a beta as soon as enough of the browsing functionality is
back to warrant a look.

(btw, myvclass.c was the 180kbyte source monster which implemented the old
layouting core. Seeing it being "cvs removed" from the development tree was a
moment of great joy to all of the V developers :-)

                        PAYBACK STATUS REPORT: PART XII
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4 July 2000 - The Latest News

A lot of people have emailed me lately asking when I expect the game to come
out. Unfortunately, because I rather underestimated the sheer size of the game,
I don't expect it to be released until late October or early November. I
apologise for keeping you all waiting, but suffice to say that the extra time
will be put to good use.

Anyway, here's what's been added to the game since last time:

   - I've spent a lot of time this month optimising the physics and AI routines
     (since they were consuming more CPU time than the graphics routines),
     which increased the framerate by about 30%.
   - A large amount of time was also spent fixing lots of annoying little bugs.
   - An on-screen map has been added.
   - Several new missions and vehicles have been added.
   - The collision detection has been extensively revamped, finally getting rid
     of all the known bugs.
   - Vehicles now roll down slopes, and slower vehicles struggle to get up steep
     hills.

That's it for this time; see you in a month's time!

    INNOVATIVE AMIGA NEWSLETTER 6/2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From: "Felix Schwarz" <info@innovative-web.de>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Innovative brings Digita(TM)-power to your AMIGA!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Innovative has developed a driver for DigiCams running the Digita(TM) Operating
Environment. Digita(TM)-enabled DigiCams offer much more flexibility and
abilities than everything else currently on the market. Digita(TM) is used in
high-end-cameras of different companies, runs on PowerPC- and Coldfire-CPUs and
allows you to run scripts, applications and games (incl. MAME!!) on your camera.
The developers of Digita(TM), Flashpoint(TM) (http://www.flashpoint.com/) wants
to make Digita(TM) the standard for DigiCams and specified a standardized
communication-protocol between computer and camera. With the now available
VHI-driver, AMIGA-users finally get access to these amazing cameras and can
download and rework pictures from these cameras. Currently available
Digita(TM)-enabled DigiCams are

   - Kodak DC 220, DC 260, DC 265, DC 290
   - Minolta Dimage 1500 EX, Dimage 1500 3D
   - HP PhotoSmart C500, C619, C912,
   - Pentax EI-200, EI-2000

P.S.: In this case, Digita(TM) has nothing to do with the developers of
Wordworth but is the name of a product by Flashpoint(TM).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           New marketplace (buy & sell) for VHI-boards and -DigiCams
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to popular demand, we have decided to create a forum for selling and buying
VHI-boards and -DigiCams. This forum can be reached via "Support" from the VHI

                             SHOGO: PROGRESS REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25-June-2000: Progress report for Amiga/Linux versions of Shogo by Hans-Joerg
Frieden

It has been some time since our last progress report but in the meanwhile a lot
of progress was made.

   - Renderer

     The software renderer is already fully working and we expect the hardware
     renderer to be finished within a few days. We are working on removing the
     internal transformation code and move the geometry processing into OpenGL
     thus allowing the renderer to take advantage of special CPU instruction
     sets as well as supporting hardware T&L of the GeForceTM and forthcoming
     graphics chip generation.

     The Linux software renderer supports both windowed operation as well as the
     VidMode extension of XFree86. An SVGA version is under consideration,
     although unlikely since there would be the need to completely rework the
     input subsystem.

     The Amiga renderer currently runs on graphics cards only. We are still
     considering if an AGA version will make sense. All rendering is done in 15
     or 16 bit quality, so it would be required to either use a 332 scheme for 8
     bit displays or use HAM8; neither solution seems appealing, both because of
     speed and visual quality.

   - Sound

     We are currently working on the sound code for Linux. This is almost
     completed now and is/will be using OpenAL for 3D sound. Amiga sound will
     follow. We are currently considering porting OpenAL to the Amiga to
     provide a unified sound solution for all supported platforms. Amiga sound
     will work with both AHI and native sound in any case.

     Music will be using CD Audio. There is no such thing as DirectMusicTM on
     our target systems, so music will not adapt dynamically to the situation
     but CD Audio will provide for a very good quality.

   - Input

     The input system allows for keyboard and mouse control on all systems as
     well as supporting special devices. Wheel Mice are supported under
     Linux/X11. Support for that might also come to the Amiga version. All
     systems support analog joysticks.

     The Amiga client supports PlaystationTM controllers through the PSXPort
     device. Normal pads as well as the dual shock are supported and both
     analog joysticks and all buttons, including the often-overlooked L3 and R3
     buttons, can be individually programmed. Like the Windows version, every
     function can be individually mapped. With the range binding facility it is
     possible to use slight deflections of a joystick for slower movement and
     full deflection for running.

                           EYETECH LAUNCHES EYE-PLAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eyetech launches Eye-Play - a division dedicated to the publishing and
distribution of high end games for the Classic and NG Amiga platforms

Eyetech - recently chosen by Amiga as their partner for the manufacture and
distribution of the new DevBox in the UK and Ireland - have launched Eye-Play, a
division dedicated to the publication, promotion and distribution of top-end
games for the Classic Amiga architecture and, more significantly, for those
currently in development which are designed to run under the new Amiga OE.

In launching Eye-Play Group Managing Director, Alan Redhouse, said: "We are very
excited about the opportunities that the new Amiga OE offers both to the
existing Amiga Community and to the converts it will quickly make from the wider
leisure computing world. As with every significant leisure computing platform to
date - the Sinclair spectrum of the early 80's, the Classic Amiga of the late
80's/mid 90's and the multimedia PC of the late 90's - great gaming software is
what will drive the growth and general acceptance of the Amiga OE as the defacto
standard in this market. We therefore strongly believe that good gaming software
is going to be essential to the success of the Amiga OE in the end-user market
We therefore decided to launch Eye-Play now, well in advance of the end user
version of the Amiga OE becoming available."

"As well as teaming up with the best of todays Amiga games developers, we are
also keen to help any new games writers make their fortune by using the new
Amiga SDK to write for the platform-independant Amiga OE. .

"However no matter how keen we all are to see new Amiga titles, we will apply
the same rigourous standards of selection and quality assurance to the Eye-Play
titles that has been our hallmark in hardware and serious software distribution.
We only intend to distribute software which is both upmarket and, in our
opinion, worth the money in terms of delivered quality and gameplay. As this is
an area of quality assurance that can really only be evaluated by a dedicated
gamer we have taken on a seasoned PC (NVidea2-DDR etc) games player who also has
very good Amiga knowledge to run the Eye-Play division"

As well as publishing their works Eyetech have also commited to help out
individual developers who are new to the platform by making their Amiga-endorsed
EZDev-Plus and EZDev-Tower developer systems available on concessionary terms.

Eyetech are also catering for the lower-spec'd Classic Amiga by making a number
of 68x00 classic Amiga games titles and compilations available - mostly for
purchase via download only. There will also be also be some freely downloadable
Classic games, and download demos of new and 'work-in-progress' titles for both
Classic and Amiga OE titles. The Eye-Play websites (eye-play.com, .co.uk,
.eu.com) will be open for business from the Eye-Play launch date - 1st July
2000.

Gary Peake who heads up Amigas own Amigatainment support team said "We are
delighted that Eyetech - one of Amiga Inc's first partners from the Classic
Amiga Community - has decided to endorse the Amiga OE with such enthusiasm. The
new Amiga OE will bring tremendous benefits to games developers - both new and
established - by delivering truly amazing levels of multimedia performance and
binary compatiblity across a wide range of hardware and operating systems. We
know Eyetech will bring a great deal of integrity and professionalism to the
serious gaming market and their dedicated Eye-Play division will, I know, help
spread the word about the Amiga OE and its talented developers to dedicated
gamers everywhere and take us a significantly nearer our ultimate goal of the
implementation of the total Amiverse vision."

                        DARKAGE SOFTWARE: JUNE 2000 NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Paolo D'Urso <darkage@idealia.net>

   - We've been quite silent this month, because we worked hard on the
     long-awaited update of Extreme v2.0! The new version features
     full-overscan. The contract with distribution of Extreme in the Uk by
     Alive Mediasoft is over, we ask you to stop buying it from them. More
     infos about this deal on our homepage, in the "news" section.

   - Much people asked for the release date of our game "Powerball". We're happy
     to welcome our new graphician, Richard Phager, and we're working on it in
     order to make it look even better! The game will be released during the
     summer and published by Epic Marketing Germany at a budget price.

   - Darkage Studio closed! On 20th June, our parallel activity will close.
     Darkage will now concentrate only on the production on Amiga software.
     This doesn't mean we're going to close or to going to bankrupcy, but
     simply that we won't sell anymore software that isn't produced by us. On
     our homepage you can still find some products we had in stock.

     In the future we could make some exceptions, and sell directly some special
     software by taking preorders.

   - Darkage Software announces a collaboration with Softwave! We've signed a
     deal between the company behind the italian magazine "Amiga.it" for the
     production of a monthly section dedicated to the Amiga scene in their
     great cdrom. Exceptionally, you'll be able to buy the magazine from us.
     The first issue with our "scene corner" will be the fifth, out in late
     June 2000.

                               AROS STATUS UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla <digulla@aros.org>

Some new software is ported to AROS: The freetype library
(http://www.freetype.org), BGUI and SnoopDOS. Also DOpus becomes more and more
usable. Many bugs in the Gfx.HIDD were fixed and there is now a quite usable
cybergrafx.library. Also the first version of an IDE driver for x86/Native was
committed. Also a trackdisk.device is there, so we can start porting a
filesystem to AROS.

As for BGUI, we would like someone who will keep it alive on Amiga (that is,
make sure that our changes don't make BGUI unusable on the Amiga). If you want
to help, please contact digulla@aros.org.

Also please note that my PGP-key has changed (2048bit instead of only 1024bit
for better security :-). You find my new version at
http://www.aros.org/pubkey.asc (Shift-Click on the link to download). The
fingerprint is

pub 1024D/285A9691 2000-06-15 Aaron Digulla (Optimizer) 
Key fingerprint = AC6F 0BA0 D4DA 79A5 0547  6DB6 FCE8 F38E 285A 9691
sub 2048g/3B869E7F 2000-06-15

Lastly, my Amiga SDK has arrived. You can expect an AROS Amie/Native but
probably not soon.

                                YAM 2.1 RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YAM, the most popular Amiga mail client has now been updated to version 2.1. To
minimize download time, YAM 2.1 is distributed in four different LhA archives
which must be unpacked into the same directory before installation.

http://www.yam.ch/files/YAM21.lha     YAM 2.1 basic installation for 68020
                                      processors or better, includes English
                                      manual

YAM 1.3.x users

Before you start the installation script, it's strongly recommended that you
create a backup of the old YAM directory including all folders and configuration
files. Now you should install YAM 2.1 into your old YAM directory. YAM 2.1 will

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Oliver Wagner" <owagner@vapor.com>

AmTelnet 2.4 released

How to obtain

     amtelnet_24.lha (352460 Bytes)
     amtelnet_24.lzx (305724 Bytes)

FTP:

     ftp.vapor.com, /pub/amtelnet/
     ftp.us.vapor.com, /pub/amtelnet/
     ftp.ch.vapor.com, /pub/amtelnet/

WWW:

     http://www.vapor.com/
     http://vapor.meanmachine.ch/

     (for other WWW/FTP mirrors, please see http://www.vapor.com/download/)

E-MAIL:

     Mail to <fileserv@vapor.com>, put "SEND AMTELNET" in the body.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

AmTelnet II is a client for the Internet "Telnet" and "SSH" protocols for
remotely logging into computers, playing text-oriented multi-user games ("MUD"s
or "MUSH"s) or manually simulating internet protocols.

2. Changes since previous release

   - "Client break" functionality

   - heavily improved output speed when receiving a lot of input due to
     automatic scroll-jump heuristics

For a full list of changes, see below.

3. Note for registered AmTelnet 1.x users

AmTelnet II requires new keyfiles. However, the upgrade for registered AmTelnet
1.x users is *FREE*. New keyfiles have been mailed out to all existing AmTelnet
1.x users to the e-mail addresses on which they originally received their
keyfiles.

Should you, for some reason, not have received your AmTelnet II keyfile yet,
please mail your current AmTelnet keyfile together with a short note on *WHERE*
and *WHEN* you originally registered to <keyfile-update@vapor.com>. Please note
that those requests have to be manually processed by a poor overworked software
developer (me), and thus they generally have awkward response times -- sorry for
that.

Please note that NetConnect II users are not entitled for an free AmTelnet II
upgrade. AmTelnet II is part of the general NetConnect III upgrade, however,
please contact Active Technologies for any relevant information on the
NetConnect package issues.

4. Registration

AmTelnet II will work in 15 minute demonstration mode without a keyfile.

AmTelnet II can be registered with the included registration utility or directly
online with any major credit card at

     http://www.vapor.com/order/

Delivery of keyfile is instantious with the online registration system.

5. Bug reporting Please mail bug reports and enhancement suggestions to

     <amtelnet-bugs@vapor.com>

Any reportes submitted this way are automatically entered into the VaporWare bug
tracking system. Please see

     http://bugs.vapor.com/

on more information on how to access the bug tracking system.

6. Documentation

As the time of writing, AmTelnet II totally lacks any documentation. Any
volunteers on that are greatly appreciated :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since last public release (2.3):

2.3.1

   - GUI: fixed fonts in about window buttons (Olli)

2.3.2

   - Net: Added "Client break" functionality. If executed, AmTelnet will sent a
     CTRL^C to the remote end and then eat up all following output until there
     is 1/2 second of network silence, then it will output the last line (or
     parts of that). This is extremly useful if you started a massive
     output-generating command (like, ls -lR /) and due to network latency
     and/or output slowness, are not likely to see a simple CTRL^C being
     executed in this century (Olli)

2.4 [release]

   - added optimized outputting heuristics: when more than 256 bytes of data
     come in a time, AmTelnet sets Term.mcc into quiet mode and does a full
     screen refresh after the output. Heavily speeds up outputting of large
     amounts of text due to removed scrolling requirements (Olli)
   - added new Term.mcc, Textinput* and Popplace holder revisions
   - added Catalogs by ATO
   - recompiled with full optimization

              HYPERION SIGNS SOLDIER OF FORTUNE FOR AMIGA AND MAC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neuss, Germany, 11 June 2000

Hyperion is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement with
Activision Inc. (NASDAQ: AVTI) to port Raven Software's smash-hit "Soldier of
Fortune" to the Amiga and Mac platforms.

Soldier of Fortune is based on a heavily modified version of ID Software's Quake
2 engine. It delivers the most realistic, covert-operative themed shooter ever
created by plunging players into the secret and deadly world of the modern-day
gun-for-hire via dozens of real-to-life missions, spanning five continents and
innovative multiplayer modes.

"After the successful conversion of Raven Software's other Quake 2 engine based
masterpiece Heretic 2, we are looking forward to tackling Soldier of Fortune ",
says Ben Hermans, managing partner of Hyperion entertainment software. "By
licensing such a high-profile quality title for the Amiga and Mac platforms, we
are demonstrating our commitment to bring AAA titles to alternative operating
systems."

"I was very impressed with the port that Hyperion did of Heretic 2. The game
play experience of Heretic 2 was captured in full in the Amiga port which was
indistinguishable from the PC version", said Michael Crowns, Raven Software's
Director of Product Development, who added that he was "looking forward to
seeing Soldier of Fortune running on Mac and Amiga."

"Soldier of Fortune" will be published by Titan Computer and is slated for
release in Q4 of 2000. Requirements to be announced.

Raven Software is an award winning computer game software developer based in
Madison, Wisconsin.

Activision Inc., headquartered in Santa Monica, California, Activision Inc.
(NASDAQ: AVTI) is a leading worldwide developer, publisher and distributor of
interactive entertainment and leisure products. Founded in 1979, Activision
posted revenues of $436 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999.

     often doesn't merit a feature to itself. We hope this format will
     encourage readers to write in with their own suggestions, knowing they
     aren't expected to write a long feature. If you have a hint or tip you'd
     like to see published in the first "Top Tips" please send it to the usual
     address.

     As usual contributions, letters and images for the gallery are most
     welcome, but we must receive them by the end of June.

     We aim to have Issue six out by mid August.

   - Kickstart Show

     We attended the Kickstart show in Surrey on the 27th of May as planned. The
     show was very successful for Clubbed, we sold more magazines than expected
     and many people decided to subscribe. We also met some existing
     subscribers and got some excellent feedback and suggestions. A longer
     report with photos is on the SEAL website.

   - SEAL Show

     We (South Essex Amiga Link) will be holding our own Amiga show in Basildon
     on Sunday the 10th of September. We already have several dealers,
     developers and usergroups confirmed and plan to have plenty of
     competitions, demonstrations and other activities throughout the event.
     Full details are on the SEAL website at http://www.seal-amiga.co.uk.

The next update will be at the beginning of July when, with a following wind,
most of the writing for issue 6 will be completed.

           AMIGA'S JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE OFFICIALLY AUTHORIZED BY SUN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High performance, memory efficient solution for running JavaTM technology based
media content across consumer digital appliances

JavaOneSM Conference, San Francisco, Ca. June 6th 2000 -- Tao Group today
announced that its multimedia system for enhancing JavaTM technology based
applications, the intent, Java Technology Edition, has been awarded Sun
Authorized Virtual Machine status by passing Sun's comprehensive PersonalJavaTM
test suites.

Over several years intent has been developed by Tao's engineering team for use
in connected devices in home and mobile networks. The emphasis has been on
creating an open, comprehensive, customizable, compact, fast and binary portable
multimedia solution incorporating advanced capability in streaming audio and
video. At its heart is Tao's Sun Authorized Virtual Machine and libraries.
Today, the software is being deployed in a broad range of markets including
digital games, home networking, digital television, automotive and phones.

"Tao's commitment to compatibility is key to furthering the adoption of the Java
platform in growing markets such as consumer digital appliances," said Curtis
Sasaki, director of product marketing, Consumer Technologies, Sun Microsystems.
"Tao's compatible virtual machine and libraries offer an impressive array of
graphics capabilities to manufacturers developing devices requiring rich content
for consumers."

Bill McEwen, President of Amiga stated that "Amiga continues to support the
world's most sophisticated, multimedia engineering and artistic community. The
New Amiga platform is built around the intent foundation because only intent
provides the infrastructure needed to meet our market's expectations. Amiga will
be a repository for a vast amount of high value, intent-based multimedia content
and we see compliant Java-language applications running on Tao-based engines as
a fundamental component in making Amiga the de facto standard."

"intent's advanced multimedia technologies in association with Java technology
gives Tao a unique and strong position in the consumer market," stated Hiro
Uchida, General Manager of Strategic Venture Management Group, Sony Corporation.

"There is a growing market demand for Java applications running on ARM®
core-based devices," said Andrew Cummins, Java Program Manager, ARM. "Tao's
solution for the ARM architecture provides our silicon and systems partners with
a highly effective multimedia component for the next-generation of Java enabled
devices targeting a wide range of applications including automotive, digital
television and mobile communications solutions."

Ray Burgess, Corporate Vice President of Motorola noted "Java technology is fast
becoming a requirement in the imaging and entertainment world. However, size and
power limitations have often limited the experience of using Java software in
consumer products. Tao's fully compliant, accelerated Java engine will help us
break through this limitation and opens up a whole range of new opportunities
for networked Java devices."

Mike Foss, Executive Manager for Hitachi Semiconductor, commented, "Our support
for Tao goes back some years. We are pleased that Tao's multimedia Java
technology support on the SH family of microprocessors is both compliant and so
exciting."

Takeshi Shibamoto, Associate Director of Victor Co. of Japan [JVC], remarked "I
am delighted to see that Tao's wonderful technology is now fully branded. We
have been working with the team at Tao for some years and are pleased that our
belief in this world-class software has been fully justified. I expect that
Tao's software will have a major presence in the consumer and professional space
for many years."

Hiroshi Saito, Director and General Manager at Fujitsu Aichi Engineering stated
that "Fujitsu AEL strongly endorses Tao's technology because its Java and
multimedia simply make it the best in its class."

"Cadence Design Services and Tao are working closely together to bring
integrated technology and design service solutions, leveraging Tao's intent JTE
(Java Technology Edition) product, to the global embedded market" said Brent
Hudson, vice president and general manager of Cadence's Wireless and Multimedia
Design Group. "intent combines superb performance with small memory footprint,
and is ideally suited to the rapidly growing digital TV market, an area in which
we have built significant expertise, and where Java compliance is a vital
component."

"It's so good to be able to talk about a breakthrough technology that really
does provide what the market needs and also actually exists," said Tetsuya
Hikino, Managing Director, NEC Electronics (UK) Limited, "the capabilities of
Tao's software are stunning and I'm sure it will proliferate globally in
Multimedia and Internet-based devices."

According to Huw Price-Stephens, Technical Director at Yes Television, a leading
provider of interactive television products and services, "Java compliance is a
critical requirement to enable broadcasters and content providers to guarantee
interoperability across multiple platforms. Yes Television is a strong supporter
of Java technology and is pleased to be able to take advantage of Tao's unique
and compliant JVM implementation."

Martyn Gilbert, Chief Executive of Amino Communications said, "While Amino's
hardware developments have revolutionized the way that custom Internet
appliances are now being created, Tao has achieved much the same with its
software media capabilities. We've looked at the market very closely to make
sure that we offer our customers the very best from top to bottom, and Tao is so
far advanced beyond any competition that it requires a double take just to
believe it!"

"This announcement further establishes Java technology as the development
platform of choice for smart devices," stated Jaison Dolvane, President and CEO
of Espial. "Tao and Espial have been working together to provide a superior and
comprehensive smart-device solution, complete with multimedia capabilities, the
Java language, a universal service-management platform, core Internet
applications and development tools. Combined with Tao's superior multimedia and
Java virtual machine technologies, Espial will soon provide its customers with
complete and robust solutions for the TV, wireless, auto, gaming and
Internet-appliance markets."

"By combining high performance with a small memory footprint, intent addresses
the demanding requirements of next-generation appliances based on the QNX® 4
Realtime OS," said Linda Campbell, vice president of strategic alliances at QNX
Software Systems. "Together, QNX and intent offer developers a solution that is
at once reliable, open, and media-rich."

Mr. Norizaku Suzuki, President of ASCII Corporation in Japan said, "ASCII helped
sponsor this program and we've watched it develop with great admiration. Tao's
technology has so much value-add that's critical to the consumer electronics
manufacturers, broadcasters, operators and consumers, and we believe the mass
proliferation of intent is inevitable."

Yasuhiro Kawashima, President of WebLogic, said, "We and Tao are looking to
further differentiate the wonderful intent Java multimedia products with the
introduction of WebLogic's value-added, hardware acceleration. An inexpensive,
super-fast and Java-compliant multimedia solution is something everyone should
be happy about."

"We have had nothing but complete support from Sun. Its openness is refreshing,"
said Francis Charig, Chairman of Tao Group. "I think the model that they have
developed, which encourages companies like Tao to add value to their standard
offerings, is very successful. Tao has been able to add technologies to help
with the binary portability, to advance memory usage, to bring in new, high
value, garbage collection techniques and customization and many unique features
while maintaining the critical compatibility to the Java specification. Most
significant though is that we are driving forward the digital appliance market
utilizing high performance, multimedia Java based applications."

                       TWF JULY 2000 UPDATE (OR LACK OF)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ed Collins (ed@worldfoundry.com): "Sorry folks. At the moment with some internal
changes taking place in TWF, there isn't time for a monthly news update".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   AMIGAVIDEOGAMES OPEN GROUP (AVOG) IS BORN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AVOG is a new group formed by Amiga developers, musicians and graphists. AVOG
has born to end the annoying situation of not having proper documentation and
easy to use routines when creating videogames for Amiga computers. Please, take
your time to explore the AVOS's web site at http://pc.ag0ny.com/ and think about
helping them if you can!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           FIRST PROGRAM WITH THE SDK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a recent post to comp.sys.amiga.misc, Gary Peake <gary@amiga.com> said that
"Aaron Digulla of AROS fame seems to be the author of the very first open source
program ported under the new Amiga SDK. Aaron has ported gzip. Congratulations
to Aaron from all of us for quick work!!".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         PORTING CLASSIC CODE TO ELATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to Gary Peake, the classic code is easier to port to Elate than
Windows although it is not a straight recompile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 AMIGAOS SOURCE CODE NOT TO BE FREELY RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gary Peake: "Making the (AmigaOS classic) source publicly available is not going
to happen as far as I can see. Why give away such a valuable commodity. And if
it has no value, why do so many people want to get their hands on it?"

Hello and welcome to the 23rd issue of AmiChannel News.

"Have you ever heard of the last product from Amiga Inc.? Mmmm, the socks or the
cake. The new brand multimillion dollar SDK. And the Amiga developer comunity is
starring... as the dissapointed people who bought it."

Well, apart from this bad joke, the SDK is out and the first impressions are
more negative than positive. I am afraid that we have been deceived by someone.
Why? Probably you have heard of the several demostrations Amiga did in Amiga
shows like Amiga 2k in San Louis or in the World of Alternatives in Neuss
(Germany). Bill showed there some GRAPHICS demos of the new AMIE. The key here
is GRAPHICS.

Well, I have spoken with a friend of mine who has just bought it and hes very
dissapointed as the SDK does not include any MULTIMEDIA capability (d'oh) and
the only way to kill a process is... to kill Elate. Not nice, for sure.

The first problem is more a question of development. But, we thought that
everyting was progressing fast enough so the user version of AMIE would be ready
for Christmas. I am afraid that this would not be possible.

The second problem is more a question related of Virtual Processor design. It
comes from cellular phones and the killing of processes do not make sense in
these devices. But this feature is essential in a desktop environment.

Conclusions? Amiga Inc. have a long distance to walk and the future is not so
bright as we thought.

Before I forgot, if you can read french take a look at the Obligment magazine.
The last issue is now available at
http://www.netlinker.com/amigapower/indexAP.html. It's worth the reading, mate.

That's everything I wanted to say. Remember to visit the SAUG website, which is
located in:

	http://www.saug.org/

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

	noticias@saug.org

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.
