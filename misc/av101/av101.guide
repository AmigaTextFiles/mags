 Final Writer 5
 --------------

 The war of the word processors continues with a Version 5 released of
 Final Writer.

 Softwood Products, who rival digital in the Amiga business software 
 scene, are connfiden that their least product has everything a modern
 word processors needs: including HTML support for creating online doc-
 uments.

 Final Writer is now also available for PC, and its development for
 this much larger market, and competition with products like Microsoft
 Word, has had an influence on the feature available, which seems to
 have been mostly positive.

 Because of this it seems as though it will only optionally run on acc-
 elarated AGA machines, but it is compatible with others.

 It should provide the professional user with what they need though,
 and we should have a review next month.

 Eagle Systems
 -------------

 Eagle Systems, the german based manufacture, have signed and official
 deal with Amiga Technologies to badge their products 4000T.

 Even better news received from Eagle Systems is that they intend to sell
 a version of the A1200 too.

 Bittersoft are quoting a machine powered by a 68040 (the same chip as 
 the standard 4000 uses).

 Prices ranged from £800 for the A1200T to £2200 for the mother of all
 towers, the 50MHz 68060 £4000T.

 Bittersoft will also customise the machine with whatever kit you want
 including massive hard drives, CD-ROMs, graphics board and more.

 We hope to get the Eagle family of machines in for review very soon.

 In the meantime, for more information call Bittersoft on:

 Tyschtchenko Speaks
 -------------------

 When Commodore International went bankrupt May 1994, my goal was to
 keep the Amiga technology alive.

 After eight months of negatiations and with the financial help of Escom 
 AG, I had managed to obtain all patents, trademarks and all of the Amiga
 technology for Escom.

 At that time it was also clear to me that just buying Commodore/Amiga 
 was not all there was to it.

 This was only the beginning.

 It would take at least a hundred million DM to get the Amiga products
 of that time back into production.

 Escom financed and I became the president of the new company Amiga
 Technoloies, which was formed in june 1995.

 "Days and nights of hard work changed my life and in September 95, as
 promised, the first A1200 computers appeared in the shops, followed
 by the A4000T in November.

 "Up to the present, Amiga Technologies sold almost 50,000 A1200's,
 about 4000 A4000T's and almost 15,000 monitors.

 The strategy was to bring the then current products back to shops
 in 1995, to advertise the Amiga by January 1996 while starting the
 development of a new generationwhich should be ready for the market 
 by the end of 1996.

 "But things went quite a differrent way; Escom got into a financial
 chaos, even with Siemens-Nixdorf and Quelle as shareholders.

 Amiga Technologies' budget was cut completely, plans could not be
 relised any longer, the staff had to be reduced in size, and in the
 end Escom had to file for bankruptcy in july 1996.

 "Up till now, Viscorp Chicago has invessted at least half a million DM
 in buying out Amiga Technologies, Salaries of personnel had to be paid,
 lawyers, travellin-gexpenses, etc.

 "During my more than 12 years at Commodore, and now two years at Escom
 as well, I leared how one can reach goals by hard work.

 I'm still optimistic that it will all come to a successful end between
 Amiga and Vicorp before end od October 1996.

 Trustee and banks want to keep the AMIGA alive and that's great.

 As soon as there's news, we'll make it public through the press and on
 the Internet.

 "I sincerely thank you for your loyalty and patience; after all it's
 thankss to the user we're still here."

 New Owners?
 -----------

 The uncertainty surrounding just who owns the Amiga may finaly draw to
 a satisfactory conclusion  in a matter of days.

 Surprisingly though, the company most likely to gain the rights, patents
 and assest of Amiga Technologies isn't Viscorp, but the relatively unkn-
 own Canadian computer manufactures, Quikpak.

 After a series of shock revelations in early December, it emerged that
 Viscorp is almost certainly no longer in the running to buy Amiga Tech-
 nologies.

 An article printed by Bloomberg Business news revealls that the contact
 for Viscorp to buy AT was cancelled in early, October.

 Hugh Jencks, Viscorp's chief operating officer, blamed the problems in-
 volved in the deal on Escom's bankdruptcy and Viscorp's ignorance of Ge-
 rman law in general, but "front runners" for acquiring Amiga Technologies.

 Dave Robinson, lawyer involved in the case, said that Viscorp is no longer 
 the leading candidate but could still be in contention if they came up
 with the cash in time.

 The whole process has damaged Viscorp's ability to meet other business
 obligations, but Jerome Greenberg, Viscorp's chairman, staed that they
 have new plans for increased finding.

 In short, Greenberg maintains that the contract for Amiga Technologies 
 was allowed to expired because Viscorp did not believe that the assets
 justified the $40m price asked for the company.

 Meanwhile, Toronto-based Quikpak, who are already the North American
 distributor for Amiga Teechnologies and the manufactureres of the A4000T
 are hoping to close a deal to buy Amiga Technologies by Friday 13th Dec-
 ember.

 In a startling display of the enthusiam the Amiga industry been missing
 for some time, Quikpak have already designed two new machines based on
 the A4000T, ready for production as soon as the deal has been worked out.

 The first is aimed at the North American video market and is called the
 4060L, a portable Amiga designed principally for use with the Video To-
 aster Flyer, Newtel's respected Studio-on-a-card and non-linear video
 editor.

 The 4060L, first report suggest, has a built-in LCD panel monitor to 
 make it the ideal solution for outside broadcast.

 The other machine on the cards, so to speak, is t he 5050T.

 A machine based on the A4000T it comes with not only Zorro III slots as
 standard, but also PCI slots.

 This means that 3D fans can add one or more pentium or DEC Alpha PCI
 cards to their machine so that it can act as a render farm, while co-
 mmunicating with them via the excellent Siamese System that Quikpak
 vow to make and integral part of all new Amigas.

 As well as stisfying the needs of high-end users, Quikpak also plan
 on producting an entry-level home use machine, though they weren't 
 prepared to release any details at this stage.

 Amiga View will obviously be bringing you more on this exciting deve-
 lopment next month.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 DECEMBER 9, 1996

 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hugh Jencks (312) 655-0903


 A federal district court in San Jose, California issued a preliminary
 injunction on December 4, 1996, against the source of Dallas-based Curtis
 Mathes Holding Corp.'s (Curtis Mathes) Uniview interactive television
 device prohibiting further use of proprietary technology developed by
 Visual Information Service Corp.  (VIScorp) of Chicago, Illinois.
 Interactive Video Publishing, Inc.  (IVP), David Serlin, Steve Owens, and
 Kaori Kuwata and "all those in active concert or participation with them"
 were enjoined from using any of VIScorp's trade secrets or technology and
 "from manufacturing, shipping, distributing, promoting, licensing or
 selling any of that technology or any product incorporating that
 technology."

 VIScorp filed a complaint in the Northern District Court of California
 against the defendants alleging that they misappropriated its trade secrets
 and technology and licensed the misappropriated technology to Curtis Mathes
 for its Uniview product.  The court recognized that "IVP's deal with Curtis
 (Mathes) will likely be affected" by its order.  The court found that
 VIScorp "will probably succeed on the merits of its claim that defendants
 used improper means to acquire VIScorp software trade secrets, and,
 therefore have misappropriated VIScorp trade secrets." No trial date has
 been set.

 Zip success
 -----------

 Iomega recently celebrated the success of their Zip and Jaz drives
 at a series of press confrences in London by announcing their stor-
 age increase/price reduction plan for the future.

 At the moment Zip, the 100Mb system costs £170 and the disks £10 each
 while Jaz costs £500 and its 1Gb disk weight in at £90.

 Both systems have received CU Amiga Magazine Super Star awards (Zip
 in August 1995 received 96% and jaz in May 1996 received  93%), and
 indeed Iomega were keen to point out the role the Amiga has played 
 in their success here in the UK.

 The long term plan is to reduce he cost of the media for both machines 
 as well as increasing the capacity.

 Iomega envisage Zip becoming the new floppy standard and thus hope to
 have the price of the 100Mb disks it uses down to £2-3 within a few
 years.

 They hope to have a dramatic decrease in the price of Jaz cartridges
 too.

 Iomega were originaly principally known for their tape back-up systems,
 but the move into media such as Zip and Jaz has transformed the comp-
 any, resulting in sales increasing by over 400% year on year.

 They intend to achieve lower pricing by forming aliances with other 
 companies to mass produce disks.

 We reported three month  ago that they had signed a deal with Escom
 to put Zip into new computers from hat company and they have now
 signed up with many other PC manufactures, including Acer, who intend
 to produce a floppy only based machine (how original) but using Zip.

 With the release of the marginally faster Surf squirrel by Hisoft both
 Zip and Jaz come even more highly recommended by us.

 The bigger they get the cheaper the disks will get too, so if you need 
 lots of storage and want to move it about conveniently, get in contact
 with Hisoft no on: ENG-0500-223660.

 EURO LEAGUE MANAGER (Preview)
 -------------------

 Work on  : All Amigas
 Publisher: Manyx

 While we still wait for Eidos's (formerly Domark) Championship Manager 2
 (ooh! Taht sounds like fun, when's it coming out? etc etc) Manyx look set
 to pip them at the  post with Euro League Manager.

 The game boasts English, Italian, French and a special Euro Fantasy Lea-
 gue and Manyx are confident that tactics budding managers employ to ach-
 ieve success in one country is unlikely to reap rewards somewhere else -
 that sounds like the game's going to have some, not insubstantial, long-
 evity, which is a very good thing.

 Although the game doesn't currently feature real player's names or the
 correct league and cup competitions (legal reasons mate, copyright and
 all that,) Manyx are swift to point out that the game's going to come
 complete with an editor so you'll be able to change things to suite.

 There's no also there difficulty levels included, so even Bristol City
 fans should be able to play the game - which is nice.

 Manyx are confident their game, with its inclusion of several leagues,
 option for transfers (you can paert-ex players for example) and so on,
 will knock all the other football management games back into the game
 out on the field just as soon as well can.

 MAX RALLY (Preview)
 ---------

 Work on  : All Amigas
 Publisher: Fortress

 Fortress are a new bunch of teenage programmers planning on taking the
 Amiga market by storm with their first game Max Rally.

 It's a multi-player overhead racing game in the same mould as Supercars 
 or Micro Machines or ATR, but fortress are swift to point out that Max
 Rally is not based upon the look or feel of any other game.

 There's racing on several different terrains and a one-player champion-
 ship mode plus time trials and the curious Max Challenge.

 What exactly that is we don't know just yet, but when we get the game
 in (it's due for a mail-order only releae in early '97) we'll let you
 know all about it.
