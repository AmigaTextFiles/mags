@{FG Shine}Welcome to @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 8th issue of @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}.

While  I  am writing this editorial for AmiChannel News, my brother is playing a
Tomb  Raider  III demo in his Playstation. An amazing game, is it n't?. And what
does  we have  in  the  Amiga? Yes, Napalm has been just released, and I am sure
that  it will succeed, but some games which have been lately announced, they are
not proper of the modern times.

For  instance  Alive  Mediasoft  have  announced  its upcoming releases, Phoenix
Fighters,  a  2D  overhead  shoot-em-up,  and  The  Prophet, a RPG game. Even an
unexpanded  A1200  can  run  these games. My God, even the current GameBoy games
are more complex than that.

For  this  reason I pray for the release of games like WipeOut 2097, the port to
the  Amiga  of  the Psygnosis best seller, and Claws of the Devil, a Tomb Raider
clone.  It  seems  that it is sure that the first one will be released. But I am
afraid  that  COTD  could  be  cancelled  at  any  time,  as well as other Titan
Computers projects.

This  kind  of  games  is  what the Amiga needs, not early 90's games like Alive
are  going  to  publish. Fortunately some big companies have released the source
code  of  some 3D games, like Hexen and Heretic. Both of them have a PPC version
(thanks  to  people like Steffen Hausser) which are amazing. And Alive are doing
their best to provide the gfx data in order to run these games in the Amiga.

More  and more people are upgrading their Amigas with PowerPC and GFX cards like
the Bvision PPC or the Picasso IV. And Sam Jordan along the Frieden brothers are
working  hard  to provide a 3D API for making games (BTW, a beta version of Warp
3D have been released with Permedia 2 support). And people want to run games and
application which can fully exploit their new hardware.

And  what  about  the  "cows" in South Dakota?. No news means bad news? It seems
that  there  will  be  a  big  announcement next month in St. Louis (Where did I
heard  this  before?)  It's time for the release of the developer boxes and some
facts  about the Amiga OS 3.5, in case they are in target. And it seems that the
Gateway  people  are  quite pissed nowadays with Amiga Inc. delays. If they were
the only ones...

Finally  I  would  like  to  say  "thanks" to @{I}Donald Feldbruegge @{UI}so far the only
reader who has been kindly enough to send me a letter.

ANYONE INTERESTED IN A PORT OF @{B}AXIA@{UB} TO @{B}AMIGAOS@{UB}?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{B}Wildcard  Design,  Inc.@{UB}  are  considering  porting  one of their games (@{B}Axia@{UB}) to
@{B}AmigaOS@{UB}   if   there   is   enough  interest  in  it  at  the  DOS  price.  (See
@{B}www.buydirect.com@{UB}  and  click  on  'Games'.  @{B}Axia@{UB}  is currently #5). If there is
enough  demand  for  it, they will look into porting. If ported, it would need a
minimum of the @{B}OCS@{UB} chipset.

@{B}Axia@{UB}  is  a  smooth top view, 360-degree scrolling space shoot-em-up game that's
unique  in  its egocentric control and display. (The world revolves around you!)
It boasts intense graphics & special effects, realistic gameplay, awesome music,
and spectacular sound effects.

Send  an  e-mail to @{I}John Delamore @{UI}at @{I}jdelamore@wcdesign.com @{UI}if you'd like to see
it  on  the @{B}AmigaOS@{UB}. Take a look at @{B}www.wcdesign.com/products/axia.html@{UB} for some
screenshots, or download the @{B}BeOS@{UB} or @{B}DOS@{UB} demo to take a look at how it plays.

blank e-mail to @{I}goad-suscribe@egroups.com @{UI}

@{B}2 BIT PRODUCTIONS@{UB} ANNOUNCES COMMERCIAL RELEASE OF @{B}STORM OF THE EYE@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}Press Release @{UI}

@{B}2 Bit Productions@{UB} Announces Commercial Release of @{B}Storm of the Eye@{UB}, A GUI Driven
Play-By-Email Game for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

Perth, Western Australia - 25th January 1999.

@{B}2 Bit Productions@{UB} today announced the release of @{B}Storm of the Eye@{UB}, a large scale
strategy wargame played via email.

@{B}Storm  of  the  Eye@{UB}  is  a  commercial  Play  by  Email  game, which has been in
development  for two and a half years, and in playtesting for the past 6 months.
The  game  caters  for  up  to  100  players at a time, with each player using a
sophisticated   front   end   program  to  view  their  turns  and  input  their
instructions.   Turns   are  processed  weekly,  with  one  turn  costing  $2.50
Australian.

Each  player has control of one of the worlds' 100 tribes. Gods perform miracles
regularly  for the devout, and the sacrifice of conquered enemies is encouraged.
All  is  not what it seems in this happy (yet bloodthirsty) world. A complicated
sequence  of  events  which  began  thousands  of years ago is rapidly nearing a
conclusion, and the future is very uncertain.

@{B}2  Bit  Productions@{UB}  are  currently  accepting  reservations for places in first
commercial  game,  which will begin once it is full. Players will not be charged
anything  until the commencement of the game. The front end program is free, and
can  be downloaded from the website below. A demonstration turn is available for
download also so people can have a closer look at the mechanics of the game.

@{B}2  Bit  Productions@{UB} is a small company, dedicated to providing the best and most
innovative play by email games on the market.

For more information, visit the @{B}2 Bit Productions@{UB} website at @{B}www.2bp.com@{UB} or send
email to @{I}info@2bp.com @{UI}

To  celebrate  the  Millenium,  @{B}Alive  MediaSoft@{UB} are holding the world's biggest
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  software  survey in years. We have always prided ourselves in our ability
to  track down old games for people through our "Classic Search Service" as well
as stocking a large range of classic titles in our catalogue.

Over the last 10 years, the @{B}Amiga@{UB} has given us thousands of brilliant games (not
to  mention  just  as  many crap ones!). It can sometimes be difficult for us to
choose which games people will want.

To  celebrate  all  the great games, we launching the "MILLENIUM SURVEY" to find
out the greatest @{B}Amiga@{UB} games of all time.

By  voting,  you can help your favourite games to see the light of day again. On
June  1st,  @{B}Alive  MediaSoft@{UB} will announce the survey winners giving you the top
ten  from  each catagory like Best Adventure, Best Beat 'em Up and so on. During
the  months running up to the announcements, @{B}Alive MediaSoft@{UB} will put in 110% to
obtain  the  winning  games.  All  winning titles will go on sale from June 1st.
Obviously, many of the games will be limited availability. So if say, 100 people
vote  for  @{B}Sim  City 2000@{UB}, and we can only get 50 copies, we will give those who
voted  the  first  opportunity to buy a copy before onening sales to the general
public.

Vote now, and receive your chance to reserve your favourite all time game!

As  if  all  that isn't enough, @{B}Alive@{UB} are celebrating this "Millenium Survey" by
giving  away hundreds of pounds worth of prizes. All voters will be entered into
the prize draw for a chance to win one of the prizes below:

  * 1st prize: £100 Alive gift certificate
  * 3 x 2nd place prizes of £20 Alive gift certificates
  * 10 x 3rd place prizes of free software titles.

On  @{B}Alive@{UB}'s  web  page,  you will soon be able to download a list of @{B}Amiga@{UB} games
from  brand  new  titles,  dating  right back to the good old days of @{B}Elvira@{UB} and
@{B}Project X@{UB}! This little slice of nostalgia may help jog your memory and give some
ideas for your vote.

Full details of how to enter along with a voting form are going out to all @{B}Pulse@{UB}
subscribers.  If  you  don't  already  subscribe  to @{B}The Pulse@{UB}, you can do so by
emailing  us your postal address. Subscription is totally free. It is simply our

@{I}@{B}THE PROPHET @{UB}@{UI}

A  quick  note  about a game @{B}Alive@{UB} will be releasing around late April/early May
this  year:  @{B}The  Prophet@{UB}.  This  is  a dungeon master style adventure game made
exclusively  for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} by an up and coming team based in Leicester, England,
headed by a talented chap called @{I}Mark Ford. @{UI}

Full  details  and  demo  will  follow  in  time,  but to give you an idea, it's
hard-drive only for floppy users, or CDrom installable on hard-drive.

This  is  going  to  be  a  huge  adventure  game,  with astounding features and
incredible playability. Full details to come soon....

@node not05 "DELSYD SOFTWARE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU"

@{B}DELSYD SOFTWARE@{UB} WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{B}Delsyd Software@{UB}, the first development team to announce a game for the @{B}Amiga NG@{UB},
are  taking a survey to see how fast the average @{B}PPC@{UB}-based @{B}Amiga@{UB} is, so they can
keep this in mind during the programming phase of @{B}The Last Patriot@{UB}.

This  survey is due to the fact that the @{B}Amiga NG@{UB} dev. boxes are nonexistant, so
they don't see a reason why they should postpone the release of @{B}TLP@{UB} for the @{B}PPC@{UB}.
Their  new target release date for @{B}TLP@{UB} is November-December 1999. This will be a
limited  release,  that  is,  they will publish the game themselves in a limited
quantity,  and  sales  from  this  limited  release will help them upgrade their
manufacturing  facilities,  so  they can release more copies of @{B}TLP@{UB}. An @{B}Amiga NG@{UB}
release  is  still  planned,  but recent delays with the dev boxes could push it
back a bit.

And,  if  this  wasn't  good  enough  news,  @{B}Delsys  Software@{UB} have more games in
development. Below is a list of future releases with planned release dates.

        @{B}The Last Patriot@{UB}                 Nov/Dec 1999

READ THIS IF YOU WANT @{B}QUAKE2@{UB} FOR THE @{B}AMIGA@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hello Everyone,

A  licence for @{B}Quake 2@{UB} or @{B}Half Life@{UB} seems as it will cost a lot of money, so how
about getting the game ported to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} by @{B}ID Software@{UB}? It seems a long shot,
but  it  is  well  worth a try. If @{B}ID@{UB} see a possible @{B}Amiga@{UB} market, then they may
take  the  chance  to  release  some  stunning  games  to the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. What I want
everyone  to do is to get everyone they know to write a small message of support
to  get  an  @{B}AmigaPPC@{UB}  version of @{B}Quake2@{UB}. Get all your friends who don't have an
internet connection to give you a text file on disk, then you can attach them to
your  e-mail.  Come  on,  if you want @{B}Quake 2@{UB}, make it happen now!! If you could
write  your  messages  of  support  to @{I}quake2@digital-images.demon.co.uk @{UI}we will
forward  them  to  @{B}ID  Software@{UB}.  I doubt that we will be able to reply to every
e-mail  as we are expecting a large amount of response, but if you could send an
e-mail of support, then you could have one of the best games ported to the @{B}Amiga
PPC@{UB}!

Best Regards

@{B}AMIGA FORMAT@{UB} NEWS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      From:         " @{I}Ben Vost @{UI}" @{I}ben.vost@futurenet.co.uk @{UI}
      Date sent:    Fri, 29 Jan 1999 11:08:38 +0000
      Organization: @{B}Future Publishing@{UB}
      Subject:      @{B}Amiga Format@{UB} News - for immediate dissemination!

Hi all,

Just wanted to tell you the latest news about @{B}Amiga Format@{UB}

  * After  five years of working on @{B}Amiga Format@{UB}, @{I}Nick Veitch @{UI}is finally leaving
    to  pursue  an  editing  career  on  a  different  magazine, called @{B}Computer
    Publishing@{UB} which will be on sale in the UK in May. He'll still contribute as
    a  freelancer  to  @{B}Amiga  Format@{UB},  and  @{I}Ben Vost @{UI}will take over the reins as
    editor.

  * This  means  that we really could use a staff writer on @{B}Amiga Format@{UB} to help
    with  the  production  of  the  magazine.  We'd prefer it if you were a @{B}1200@{UB}
    owner,  with an interest in music, the internet, coding and hardware and you
    knew  how  to write witty, informed and on time copy, in order to complement
    the skills of the efficient @{B}Amiga Format@{UB} team. If not, but you're interested
    in  the  post  which would involve you moving to Bath, send email explaining
    who you are, where your @{B}Amiga@{UB} expertise lies and why you'd like the job, and
    we'll   get   you   down  for  an  interview.  You  can  send  an  email  to
    @{I}ben.vost@futurenet.co.uk @{UI} with the subject "New Staffer" or send a letter to
    the usual address of 30 Monmouth Street, Bath BA1 2BW.

  * The  third  bit  of  news  concerns two new mailing lists for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. The
    first  - "afb-announce" is a list that gives out the details of what will be
    in  the  next  issue of @{B}Amiga Format@{UB} before it becomes on sale in the UK, or
    sent  out  to  subscribers.  If  you  want to know what we'll be covering in
    advance,  you  should  subscribe  to  this  list.  You can do so by visiting
    @{B}www.egroups.com/list/afb-announce/@{UB}  and  signing up. You can expect an email
    every four weeks or so.

We  also  have  an  open  discussion  list,  called @{B}afb@{UB}, which is available from
@{B}www.egroups.com/list/afb/@{UB}.  It's  a  bit  hectic,  but  it's a good place to get
general  (and specific) @{B}Amiga@{UB} information. At the moment, the list gets about 65
messages  a  day,  so  it's  quite  busy,  but offers the facility to read these
messages  on  the  web,  so you don't have to have your mailbox filled with them
constantly. Both mailing lists also have additional facilities in their calendar
functions,  which  allow  you to see important upcoming events; and polls, which
allow for online voting on important topics. Join up, and see what you think.

All the best,
--

Subject: [yamnews] @{B}YAM@{UB} News Vol. 4
Date: Tue, 2 Feb 99 20:14:00

@{I}*Contents*@{UI}
  * @{B}YAM 2 beta@{UB} status
  * Problems downloading more than 60 messages
  * Using mailing list support
  * Using fixed fonts
  * Current versions

================================================================================

@{I}@{B}YAM 2 @{UB}beta status @{UI}

Currently  there are a few internal betas of @{B}YAM 2@{UB}. A new public prerelease will
become available in about one month.

Since @{B}YAM 2p6@{UB}, some bugs have been fixed:
  * saving decrypted PGP message didn't work
  * encrypted PGP/MIME messages didn't contain content-type headers
  * texts encoded with PGP/MIME were not decoded before displaying
  * @{B}YAM@{UB} crashed when dropping files on the appicon
  * "OpenURL.library" support didn't always work
  * @{B}YAM@{UB}  hung  when  the  alias  of an existing address book entry was set to an
    empty string
  * when  editing  a  sent  message,  'add info' and signature settings were not
    remembered
  * when  starting  @{B}YAM@{UB}  from a directory other than the program directory, some
    configuration files couldn't be found
  * random tagline generator ignored first and last tagline
  * remote filters didn't work
  * when  getting  mail  from  multiple  servers, the pre-selection list was not
    cleared
  * a couple of other small bugs

There are some new features as well, for example:
  * mailing  list support (To pattern/address) is now working in incoming folder
    too
  * result list in search window is now sortable
  * @{B}YAM@{UB} now displays current host/spoolfile name in transfer window
  * tagline  hashfile  is now automatically updated if the tagline file has been
    modified
  * reworked   folder   settings:   separate   configuration  window,  menus  to
    create/edit/delete folders
  * you can now create an unlimited number of folders
  * sort  by  subject  now  ignores  any  mailing  list  suffix if the suffix is
    embedded in [ ]
  * re-introduced  keyboard  shortcuts  for  the  toolbar buttons (problems with
    menus fixed)
  * "WEBmail.rexx" launches @{B}YAM@{UB} from a web browser
  * error message history can be cleared
  * killfile support now works for all header fields
  * shift-click a column title to set the second sort key
  * folder  list  is  now  sortable  by  clicking  on  the column title or using
    drag&drop
  * hidden  option  AutoSave  automatically saves contents of texteditor every x
    seconds
  * bubble help of folder/message lists now show information about current entry
  * drag&drop of addresses from message list into recipient fields
  * append an existing message as attachment using drag&drop
  * message time can be displayed in Swatch Beats instead of hh:mm
  * new @{B}ARexx@{UB} commands REQUESTSTRING and REQUESTFOLDER

@{I}Problems downloading more than 60 messages @{UI}

@{B}YAM  2p6@{UB}  crashes  on  some  POP3  servers  when there are more than 60 messages
waiting.  If  this  is  a problem for you, use preview 5 until the bug is fixed:
@{B}www.yam.ch/preview/YAM20P5.lha@{UB}

================================================================================

@{I}*Using mailing list support* @{UI}

Some  users complained that the mailing list support is not working. Here's what
you should pay attention to:
  * Mailing  list  support is only required if the mailing list software doesn't
    set  the  "Reply-To"  field  to  the  return address of the list. If "From:"
    contains  the sender address and "Reply-To:" is the list address, there's no
    need to use ML support.
  * ML  support  only  works  in  one  single  folder. Usually you move incoming
    messages  from  a  mailing  list to a special folder using filters. Then you
    read  the messages and reply to some of them. The ML support should be setup
    for that particular folder only.
  * The "To:" pattern is compared against the whole "To:" header. So if you only
    specify the E-mail address, then you must put #? around it.

@{I}*Example* @{UI}

From: List Member@{I}member@private.com @{UI}
Reply-To: List Member @{I}member@private.com @{UI}
To: The List @{I}list@listserver.com @{UI}

Note that the reply-to field should be set to @{I}list@listserver.com @{UI}
It isn't, so we could now use the mailing list support feature:
  * To: pattern: @{I}?list@listserver.com? @{UI}
  * To: address: The List @{I}list@listserver.com @{UI}

================================================================================

@{I}*Using fixed fonts* @{UI}

To  use  fixed  width fonts in the read window and the editor of @{B}YAM@{UB}, it doesn't
suffice  to  enable  'Fixed width font' in the Read section of the configuration
window.
  * Select 'Settings/@{B}MUI@{UB}' to open @{B}MUI@{UB} Preferences
  * Then go the the TextEditor section
  * Now you can select the desired font in 'Fonts/Fixed'

@{B}NETAX1200@{UB}: A SOLUTION TO NETWORK @{B}A1200@{UB}/@{B}A600@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{B}Netax1200@{UB}  is  the  best  solution  for  @{B}Amiga  1200@{UB}/@{B}600@{UB} owners to network their
computers  in a smart and cheap way. The card plugs in the @{B}PCMCIA@{UB} slot and gives
a fast, powerful and reliable @{B}Ethernet@{UB} connection, in a 100% compatible way with
other  platforms.  The @{B}Netax1200@{UB} is a fast @{B}PCMCIA@{UB} "credit card" who comes with a
detailed  printed  manual, a pass-trough "T" connector for @{B}BNC@{UB} cables and a disk
including the @{B}Netax@{UB} software for @{B}Amiga@{UB} Systems. The software features a standard
system device ( @{I}netax.device @{UI}), that makes the card compatible with almost every
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  networking  software,  including  @{B}Genesis@{UB},  @{B}NetConnect@{UB}, @{B}AmiTCP@{UB}, @{B}Miami@{UB} and
@{B}MiamiDeLuxe@{UB}.  The  device  fully  complies  to  @{B}SANA-II@{UB} specifics, so also other
software like @{B}Envoy@{UB} run flawlessly and with no bottlenecks.

The @{B}Netax1200@{UB} also features a full combo connector for both standard @{B}UTP@{UB} and @{B}BNC@{UB}
cabled  networks, and can also be plugged while your computer is on with no risk
for  the  computer  or the peripherals. By providing a full @{B}Ethernet@{UB} connection,
the  @{B}Netax1200@{UB} can be used to network the @{B}Amiga@{UB} with almost every other computer
as @{B}PC@{UB}s, @{B}MAC@{UB}s, @{B}UNIX@{UB} like systems and so on.

The   card  consumes  no  CPU  time,  leaving  your  processor  free  for  other
applications,  unlike  other  networking devices do, and assures you unthinkable
speeds  also on the plain @{B}68000@{UB} mounted on the @{B}Amiga 600@{UB}. We recommend anyway at
least  a  @{B}68030@{UB} processor to get the best out of your @{B}Netax1200@{UB} and reach higher
speed  rates. Our tests indicate that in FTP mode, the @{B}Netax1200@{UB} provides speeds
not  lower  than  500kb/sec. with peaks of 600kb/sec on a simple @{B}030@{UB}. With a @{B}060@{UB}
processor the speed goes over 800kb/sec, making the @{UB}Netax1200@{UB} one of the fastest
card available for any @{UB}Amiga@{UB} model.

Technical Details:
  * Credit card @{B}PCMCIA@{UB} type II
  * 10 MBit @{B}Ethernet@{UB}
  * Combo transceiver with @{B}UTP@{UB}/@{B}BNC@{UB} connectors
  * Network and Transfer leds

Price: 198 DM (120 US$)

FURTHER DEVELOPMENT ON @{B}JVP@{UB} DEPENDS ON YOU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{B}JVP@{UB}  (@{B}Jey  Visual  Pascal@{UB})  is  a  developer  tool  for  @{B}Pascal@{UB} programmers from
beginners  to professionals. It helps you to create, program and handle gui very
easily  and neat. The idea is very close to that of visual programming tools and
compilers on "PeeSee's". It is being developed by @{I}Hossein Shirdashtzade @{UI}.

Recently,  a  demo version has been uploaded to @{B}Aminet@{UB}. This demo version is not
as sophisticated as the visuals which let you program within the @{B}JVP GUI Manager@{UB}
(@{B}JVPM@{UB}),  but  if you and your friends send the author mails or snails supporting
and encouraging him to continue he will complete it and make it as a ShareWare.

So send a mail that indicates your interest in @{B}JVP@{UB} until 01-Apr-99:
    Email: @{I}shirdash@www.dci.co.ir @{UI}
or send him by snail to the following address:
    No. 132, Kerdabad,
    Jey st., Isfahan,
    Iran
    Zip code: 81599

or call (English or persian only!) to:
 +98-031-510155

Note that if he doesn't recieve enough requests to continue until 01-Apr-99 then
he will assume that @{B}JVP@{UB} is useless and quit it.

The  author  is  also looking for @{B}Pascal@{UB} programmers on the @{B}Amiga@{UB}, if you are or
know one please contact him or give him his/her email address.

@{B}KUANG ELEVEN@{UB} VIRUS WARNING!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

 * @{I}Warning @{UI}

All  @{B}Kuang Eleven@{UB} users who have received an update in the past few weeks are at
risk!

Two  viruses  have  been  released  via  the update server attached to different
versions  of  the  file  "rexxkuang11.library" (normally placed in "LIBS:"), and
also affecting the file "C:Mount".

 * @{I}Details @{UI}

The  two versions of the library which were infected are shown below, along with
some details:

"rexxkuang11.library 0.36 ( 4/02/99)"
  * File size: 31,172
  * Attaches  itself  to  your  "C:Mount"  file (any version) unless @{B}SnoopDOS@{UB} is
    running
  * Performs "run NIL: newshell TCP:2551" (both the library and "C:Mount")
  * Allows remote @{B}CLI@{UB} ("shell") access to your computer
  * Calls itself "Vaginitis #2" by "STD"
  * Does NOT spread to any other files (other than "C:Mount")

"rexxkuang11.library 0.27 (27/12/98)"
  * File size: 26,532 bytes
  * Performs "RUN NIL: newshell tcp:2333" when the library is opened
  * Allows remote @{B}CLI@{UB} ("shell") access to your computer
  * Calls itself "Vaginitis #3&quot by "STD"
  * Does NOT spread to any other files

 * @{I}Solution @{UI}

You  should  have received version 0.37 (or later) of "rexxkuang11.library" with
this update. You should verify this by typing:
 @{I}Version LIBS:rexxkuang11.library FILE FULL @{UI}

You should get the response:
 @{I}rexxkuang11.library 0.37 ( 5/02/99) @{UI}

or a later version.
  * Reboot your system (if possible, do NOT go online).
  * Replace  the file "C:Mount" from your original disks, or some other reliable
    source.
  * Reboot AGAIN.

If  you  have  any  copies of "rexxkuang11.library" versions 0.27 and 0.36, they
should  be  deleted,  as  these  were  never legitimately uploaded to the update
server.

 * @{I}Explanation @{UI}

The  server  at which the @{B}Amiga Coding Syndicate@{UB}'s updates are stored was hacked
by  an  unknown,  malicious person or persons. We have changed our passwords and
have made every effort to secure our site.

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this has caused anyone.

If  you  wish  to  eliminate  auto-updates  from your @{B}Kuang Eleven@{UB} installation,
simply rename or delete the file "Rexx/Kuang11UPD.amirx" (relative to your @{B}AmIRC@{UB}
directory).

@{B}CLICKBOOM@{UB} INTRODUCES THE @{B}CLICKBOOM AMIGA@{UB} 'PORTAL'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

Toronto,  February  11,  1999:  @{B}clickBOOM@{UB} proudly introduces The @{B}clickBOOM Amiga@{UB}
"Portal"

The  "Portal"  is a new way for @{B}clickBOOM@{UB} users to access online information, be
it  their record at @{B}clickBOOM@{UB}, or @{B}Amiga@{UB}-related content -- it's a dynamic online
database allowing for much closer interaction with the Web.

@{I}"@{B}clickBOOM @{UB} and  @{B}clickboom.com @{UB} are  undisputedly  at the top of the @{B}Amiga @{UB}games
market.", @{UI} says  @{I}Sofia  Tsiotsikas, @{UI}PR at @{B}clickBOOM@{UB}. @{I}"It is our intention to use
this  leverage  and extensive web-creation knowledge to provide @{B}Amiga @{UB}users with
the next-generation web experience -- The "Portal". Our target is now beyond the
games scope, and we are confident The "Portal" will provide all @{B}Amiga @{UB}users, not
just  players,  a great service. We strive to push technology forward, hence The
"Portal" -- the first and only on @{B}Amiga." @{UB}@{UI}

Although  this is @{B}clickBOOM@{UB}'s first step into a non-gaming area, The "Portal" is
created  with  the  same  high-quality  standard  you'd  expect  to receive from
@{B}clickBOOM@{UB}.

The "Portal" consists of the following sections:
  * AUCTIONS
  * NEWS CENTER
  * COMMUNICATION CENTER
  * STATUS INFORMATION
  * PREFERENCES

@{I}AUCTIONS @{UI}

The "Portal"'s main attraction is the fully automatic real-time online "Auction"
section. This is where all the action is -- you can bid on or sell @{B}Amiga@{UB}-related
items  at  the one and only place of its kind on @{B}Amiga@{UB}. Finally there is a place
for  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  users  to be able to trade their hardware in a simple and absolutely
private manner.

The "Portal" is the place where you will find the best @{B}Amiga@{UB} deals, guaranteed.

If  you  have  an @{B}Amiga@{UB}-related item to sell, The "Portal" is the place, hold an
auction and have other @{B}Amiga@{UB} users bid on it. It's fully automatic, create a new
auction  in  less than 5 minutes, and don't worry about it until you make a sale
at the highest offered price.

Full details on how "Auctions" function, are available at The "Portal".

@{I}NEWS CENTER @{UI}

"News  Center"  takes  a  whole  new  step  at addressing @{B}Amiga@{UB} news flow on the
Internet.  We  guarantee  you  that  "The  News  Center"  is  the simplest, most
comprehensive, one of a kind, customizable @{B}Amiga@{UB} news section on the Internet!

Instead  of  creating  another news-reporting site @{B}clickBOOM@{UB} worked with leading
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  news  sites  behind  the  scenes to create a single place on the Net from
which you will start your news search.

The  idea  behind  the  "News  Center" is very simple - every time one of the 50
@{B}Amiga@{UB} news sites currently supported gets updated, their news will appear at the
News Center!

The  news  section  is  unbiased,  because  the  actual site owners update their
section  at  The "Portal"! Moreover, you can customize which news sites you want
to have top priority.

Never  again  will  you  have  to  spend time searching sites, only to find they
haven't been updated. Just come to The "Portal" and you will immediately see the
latest  headlines  of  ALL  the sites, then with just one click go to the actual
site  and  read  the  news. Moreover, the "Portal" will remember which sites you
prefer and have them waiting at the top of the section at your next visit!

We  would  also like to take this opportunity to invite all @{B}Amiga@{UB} news sites not
currently featured at The "Portal", to contact us.

@{I}COMMUNICATION CENTER @{UI}

The "Communication Center" allows registered @{B}clickBOOM@{UB} users to communicate with
@{B}clickBOOM@{UB}  in  a  more  direct  approach and receive more efficient responses to
their  questions.  Through  a  simple  web interface you can leave a message for
@{B}clickBOOM@{UB} and your message will get the highest priority, because it will not go
to  the same pool of email letters that non-registered users got to. Then simply
check back at any time for a response.

@{I}STATUS INFORMATION @{UI}

@{B}clickBOOM@{UB}  registered users can also access their status information online. The
"Portal" recognizes when you are visiting, so it prepares dynamic content that's
tailored  for  you  only.  This  makes the "Portal" better and friendlier than a
regular  web  site. Get information such as how many BOOM$ you have; which games
you have registered; what is the status of your last order, etc.

@{I}PREFERENCES @{UI}

The  "Preferences"  section allows one to easily update his personal information
such  as change of email or mailing address. It also allows for customization of
the "Portal", such as which News sites you prefer to always see at the front.

The "Portal" is located at @{B}clickboom.com/portal@{UB}

The  "Portal"  is  not finished, nor will it ever be, it's a constantly evolving
flux, just like the Web itself. So, be prepared for even more content very soon,
as we get the engine running.

Best Regards,
@{B}clickBOOM@{UB}

@{B}DIGITAL IMAGES@{UB} UPDATE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

I  am  afraid  that @{B}Sierra@{UB} have ruled out the possibility of an @{B}Amiga@{UB} version of
@{B}Half  Life@{UB}.  They  say that at present, they are not developing or licencing any
software for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} market.

However, as we don't like to disappoint people, we are persuing another licence.
At  the  moment,  I  can't  say who it is, but we have been recieving pleanty of
votes for this game.

We  no  longer require your @{B}Quake 2@{UB} support as we have had a lot of it! Over the
last week, I have recived 236 e-mails for @{B}Quake 2@{UB} support!

Anyway, I hope to bring you news of which game we will be porting very soon.

We  have  also set up a new mailing list called @{B}GoAD@{UB}. This list is a new mailing
list  for  @{B}Amiga@{UB} games developers who wish to discuss programming ideas, recruit
new  members  to  their teams and also to help each other with problems. We will
also post a developers news file to this list every week.

@{B}THE WORLD FOUNDRY@{UB} NEWS UPDATE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From: @{I}E Collins @{UI}@{I}collins-e@dnet.co.uk @{UI}

@{I}@{B}The World Foundry @{UB}website moves to a new home @{UI}

Very soon the @{B}TWF@{UB} website will move to it's new home (@{B}www.worldfoundry.com@{UB}) with
a  new look to it. This should make it much easier to remember where our site is
as  the Monolith redirection has stopped working and the old site's true address
is quite a mouthful.

@{I}@{B}Explorer 2260 @{UB}Development update @{UI}

Development  of  @{B}E2260@{UB} has been developing well with much of the station systems
which  is  the  heart of the game making good progress. Work is also progressing
well  on  several  of the game editors that will be used to create data used for
the game (and will most likely be included with the final release).

Screenshots  won't  be  appearing for at least a few months I'm afraid. We would
like  a  release  of  a demo in the 2nd quarter and the finished game in the 3rd
quarter  but  none  of  this can be guaranteed so both demo and finished product
releases could well fall back into the 3rd and 4th quarters respectively.

@{I}@{B}Maim & Mangle @{UB}is revived @{UI}

After the game being originally cancelled after @{I}George Hornmoen's @{UI}departure from
the  team  to  pursue a @{B}PC@{UB} games development career, the rights and code for the
game  were  passed  onto us. With work needed heavily on @{B}E2260@{UB}, trying to find a
new  team to revive @{B}M&M@{UB} was put on the back burner. We now have found a new team
to work on the game and development has restarted on the game.

Some  of  the  features  have  been updated because as there are more @{B}PPC Amiga@{UB}s
available  and  better  3D  support we feel it would help make a better game and
stand   out   against  similar  realtime  wargames  such  as  @{B}Napalm@{UB},  @{B}Operation
Counterstrike@{UB},  @{B}Forgotten  Forever@{UB}, etc. Test have been performed on a 3D engine
and  we  have decided it is viable and so has been given the go ahead. Only test
graphics  of  the  3D  engine have been used so when we have progressed a little
with the engine

So  here is the info for those who have not heard of the game before and updated
feature list planned for the game.

================================================================================

Game Information

@{B}Maim  &  Mangle@{UB}  is a @{B}Dune 2@{UB} or @{B}Command & Conquer@{UB} style realtime wargame for the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  computer  but will have plenty of unique features never seen before on an
@{B}Amiga@{UB}.  It will be one of the most technically demanding @{B}Amiga@{UB} games released to
date.  However,  despite  all of the wizardry involved, game-play will always be
the top priority.

Feature List

Some of the features you can expect to see in @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB} are:

  * Total 3D:
        Thats  right!  When @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB} was originally started to be developed
        it  was  to  have a 3D landscape but things have changed since then with
        improved  @{B}Amiga@{UB} systems supporting 3D hardware acceleration so this time
        the  game  will  be in total 3D. The landscape, buildings, vehicles will
        all  be in 3D. The player will be able to move around the map and rotate
        and zoom in on units to check for damage and info on them.

        Since  the  landscape  is  in  3D,  gameplay can be different from other
        similar  games of this type as units can hide behind hills, infantry can
        scale  cliff faces and canyons, vehicles can fall off cliffs, etc. Units
        will  progress  slower  up  a  slope and faster down a slope. Units on a
        hilltop  will  have  a  longer  range of fire, however, they will have a
        'blind' spot immediately below them.

  * Multiplayer games via TCP/IP:
        @{B}Maim  &  Mangle@{UB}  will  have full TCP/IP support, so whether you have two
        @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s  linked  together over a serial cable, or they are on a network,
        you will be able to fight your friends to the death!

  * Save option for multiplayer games:
        Hey,  waging a full out assault takes time, and you might not be able to
        fit  it  into  one  session.  So  we've included the provision to save a
        multiplayer game.

  * Night-time combat: (1)
        Present  day  wars don't always take place during the day-light, and the
        wars  of  the  future will be no different. Therefore, night-time combat
        will also be present in @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB}. To complement this, infantry will
        have  flashlights,  vehicles  will  have  headlights  &  bases will have
        searchlights.  Additionally, night-time vision equipment and flares will
        also play an integral part on the @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB} battlefield.

  * Weather effects:
        As  all  battles  do not take place during the day, likewise they do not
        always  take  place  during  fair weather. Thus, weather effects such as
        rain  storms, dust storms, fog, etc. will also be encountered within the
        game.

  * Way-point navigation:
        To  complement the movement currently found in games of this style, @{B}Maim
        &  Mangle@{UB}  will  have  a 'way-point' style of directing your units. This
        will  allow  the  player  to tell the units to avoid known landmarks and
        enemy encampments.

  * Light Sourcing: (1)
        Explosions  and  lights  in  @{B}Maim  &  Mangle@{UB}  will  also  light  up  the
        surrounding  terrain. This will be especially stunning in the night-time
        battles. Plus many more!

In  addition  to  the  above  features, @{B}Maim & Mangle@{UB} will include several other
features such as a R & D element [akin to Genesia], an on-line library system of
known units, and an extensive plot to support the action!

(1)  Visual  effects of this nature may require a 3D Hardware accelerated or @{B}PPC
Amiga@{UB} to make the most of it.

Predicted System Requirements
  * @{B}Amiga@{UB} computer. Minimum @{B}040@{UB} processor.
  * @{B}PPC@{UB} boards supported from @{B}Phase 5@{UB} or @{B}G3@{UB} card from @{B}Escena@{UB}.
  * @{B}WarpOS  PPC@{UB}  kernal  will  be used. We will provide installation scripts for
    installing  @{B}WarpOS@{UB}  and  a  detailed  FAQ  for  those  people who experience
    problems using @{B}WarpOS@{UB} programs.
  * Minimum 8MB Ram.
  * CD drive (recommended 4x).
  * Hard Drive (uncertain at this time how much space will be needed).
  * GFX  Card Recommended (essential for those with only an @{B}ECS Amiga@{UB}). @{B}AGA@{UB} will
    also be supported.
  * @{B}Warp3D  V2@{UB}  driver system will be used to provide an independent of hardware
    standard for 3D on the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.
  * Modem (33.6+ recommended) and internet account for network games.
  * @{B}AHI@{UB} installed.

Support for @{B}68k Amiga@{UB}s has been decided for now but may have to be reassessed as
the  3D  engine  becomes more advanced. Possibilty of a restriction to a @{B}060@{UB} and
GFX card if speed is not good enough in lower systems.

@node not24 "VAPORWARE ANNOUNCES X-ARC 1.3 NOW AVAILABLE"

@{B}VAPORWARE@{UB} ANNOUNCES @{B}X-ARC 1.3@{UB} NOW AVAILABLE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{B}X-Arc@{UB}  is  an  archive  management  program for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}, designed in a similar
fashion to @{B}WinZip@{UB}(®) on @{B}Windows@{UB}(®) systems and @{B}Stuff-It@{UB}(®) for @{B}MacOS@{UB}(®).

@{B}X-Arc@{UB}  is  somewhat different from previously released archive management tools:
those  programs  provided  no more than a graphical interface on top of existing
archiver commands, often in a incomplete and inflexible way.

@{B}X-Arc@{UB}  offers  the  user  an  extremely  intuitive  interface for the more often
performed operations, whilst complimenting this with a range of advanced options
suitable for the expert user.

@{B}X-Arc@{UB}  provides  the user with a brand new and sophisticated way to add files to
an  archive,  mixing  speed  and  power never seen in any similar program on any
operating system.

@{B}X-Arc@{UB} is based on a modular concept, allowing any third party to develop modules
to handle new archive formats without having to alter the main program.

@{B}X-Arc@{UB}  offers  the  ability  to  perform  many operations, using drag&drop, from
within  the  main  program or with standard @{B}Workbench@{UB} icons (ie. drag files from
your  @{B}Workbench@{UB}  screen to @{B}X-Arc@{UB}'s lister window). @{B}X-Arc@{UB} also supports drag&drop
with @{B}Scalos@{UB} based lister windows.

@{B}X-Arc@{UB}  is  supplied  with  an  advanced  file  recognition engine, based on both
filename  and  content  matching,  allowing the user to display any file using a
suitable external viewer.

@{B}X-Arc@{UB}'s interface is highly configurable and customisable.

@{B}X-Arc@{UB}  allows the user to install software from within the archives, in a matter
of seconds, with its installer support.

Where to download it:

FTP:
  * @{B}ftp.vapor.com@{UB}, pub/xarc/
  * @{B}ftp.us.vapor.com@{UB}, pub/xarc/
  * @{B}ftp.au.vapor.com@{UB}, pub/xarc/
  * @{B}ftp.pl.vapor.com@{UB}, pub/vapor/xarc/
  * @{B}AmiNet@{UB}, util/arc
  * X-Arc.lha, 598500 Bytes

(Note  that  @{B}ftp.us.vapor.com@{UB}  has generally the best connectivity of the listed
mirror sites)

  * @{B}www.meanmachine.ch/vapor@{UB} (File mirror only)
  * @{B}www.AmyResource.it/X-Arc@{UB}

New features since @{B}X-Arc@{UB} last release (@{B}1.2@{UB}) include:
  * Installer  support:  you can now install software from within @{B}X-Arc@{UB}, without
    the needs to extract the archive, by just press the install button.
  * Several major and minor bugfixes.
  * Speed improvement.
  * Some GUI redesign.
  * Some new small functions and optimized old ones.
  * Some new settings in the preferences.
  * Other minor ones improvements.

New features since @{B}X-Arc@{UB} release @{B}1.1@{UB} include:
  * 4 months spent to rewrite almost all program's basic routines.
  * Several bugs fixed, some of which where severe ones.
  * Fixed some illegal memory accesses.
  * Loading and parsing routines totally rewritten.
  * All secondary routine has been adapted to the new internal program design.
  * You  can  now  update  the contents of a directory of loaded archive without
    having to reload the whole archive.
  * If  you perform an operation within one branch of the archive (e.g. adding a
    file), only this branch is updated. The whole archive is not reloaded again.
  * New  routines can handle flawlessly even archives version @{B}1.1@{UB} had problem to
    manage.
  * @{B}Version  1.2@{UB}  is 1.5 times faster than the previous version, which is a good
    result since new routines are more sophisticated and reliable.
  * @{B}Scalos@{UB} support for drag&drop.
  * A file-attributes column added.
  * Other minor ones.

@node not25 "ACTIVE TECHNOLOGIES ANNOUNCE GENESIS, A NEW TCP/IP STACK FOR THE AMIGA"

@{B}ACTIVE TECHNOLOGIES@{UB} ANNOUNCE @{B}GENESIS@{UB}, A NEW TCP/IP STACK FOR THE @{B}AMIGA@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{B}Genesis@{UB}  is  a  state-of-the-art  TCP/IP stack for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} computer. Combining
ease  of  use  with  advanced  features, @{B}Genesis@{UB} offers built in dialup Internet
connectivity and/or local area networking.

@{B}Genesis@{UB} requires @{B}Magic User Interface@{UB} (@{B}v3.8+@{UB}) in order to operate.

Further  information can be obtained from @{B}www.vapor.com@{UB} or @{B}www.active-net.co.uk@{UB}.
A  demo  is  also  available and you can register online via the @{B}Vapor@{UB} automatic
registration form.

Feature list includes:
  * Easy to setup. The software is fully configurable via a custom interface, no
    need  to  edit text files. Offers simplicity, enabling a beginner to be able
    to  setup  their  stack  within  minutes,  yet keeping the advanced features
    needed for the professional user.
  * Compatibility.  @{B}Genesis@{UB}  is  fully  compatible  with existing @{B}Amiga@{UB} Internet
    software. Based on the recognised and established @{B}AmiTCP Professional@{UB} kernel
    (@{B}v4.6@{UB}),  @{B}Genesis@{UB}  offers  the  highest possible compatibility with other net
    products, no need for @{B}AmiTCP@{UB} emulation.
  * Built-in  support.  @{B}Genesis@{UB}  ships with modules for @{B}PPP@{UB}, @{B}(C)SLIP@{UB} and support
    for other variations such as @{B}SANA-II@{UB} etc. Supports Internet access by modem,
    external @{B}ISDN TA@{UB}, internal @{B}ISDN@{UB} boards, ethernet (such as @{B}Ariadne@{UB} or @{B}Hydra@{UB}),
    serial  cards  (@{B}Hypercom@{UB},  @{B}IOBlix@{UB},  @{B}GVP-IO@{UB}  etc)  and  other  local networks
    (parnet, null modem etc).
  * Advanced  @{B}PPP@{UB} implementation: @{B}(MS)CHAP@{UB}, @{B}PAP@{UB}, @{B}Callback@{UB} (@{B}WinNT@{UB} compatible), @{B}VJ@{UB}
    compression,  protocol  field  compression,  @{B}MTU@{UB}  negotiation,  magic number
    negotiation, async map negotiation, @{B}MSDNS1/2@{UB} IP address negotiation, @{B}WINS1/2@{UB}
    IP  address negotiation, Compression Control Protocol (modules include - @{B}BSD@{UB}
    compress,  deflate  and @{B}MPPC@{UB}). Also, @{B}PPP@{UB} events control allows you to create
    scripts to perform actions when @{B}PPP@{UB} has been put on or offline.
  * Dial  control.  Teach-me  dialer,  multiple phone numbers, configurable dial
    script.
  * Comprehensive  security.  Secure  kernel to prevent illegal attacks over the
    Internet:  @{B}SYN@{UB}  flooding, IP fragment attacks, IP address spoofing, land and
    fist attacks.
  * Enhanced  @{B}SANA-II@{UB}.  Powerful and improved @{B}SANA-II@{UB} support allows the fastest
    transfer rates across an ethernet network.
  * Connection  Wizard.  Step  by step Wizard interface to connect a user to the
    Internet. Enter basic information, Wizard obtains the IP and DNS information
    automatically and records your loginscript.
  * Arexx  interface and improved API - allows external software to check status
    of interfaces, logged in user, active user and much more.
  * @{B}Socks@{UB}.  @{B}Socks v4@{UB}/@{B}5@{UB} client supplied as standard. @{B}Socks@{UB} server avaialble, free
    of charge, as a downloadable option.
  * Multiple  interface  support. This allows you to connect and disconnect more
    than  one  interface  at  one  time. For instance, create two ethernet links
    between an @{B}Amiga@{UB} and @{B}Linux@{UB} machine and another between your @{B}Amiga@{UB} and @{B}PC@{UB} and
    then  still  connect  and disconnect from your Internet (dialup) connection,
    without  the other interfaces being affected. You can even launch @{B}Genesis@{UB} on
    bootup  so  that  a  local area network is put online automatically when you
    start  your  @{B}Amiga@{UB}. This is essential for a @{B}Siamese@{UB} system, for example. You
    can  then  use  @{B}Genesis@{UB} for modem dialup or route your dialup connection via
    the  remote  computer.  Multiple  interface support is easy to setup and the
    interfaces  are  listed  within  the main status window (shown here). Allows
    routing between interfaces.
  * Multiple-user  support. Full support and API for multiple-users. Create more
    than  one  user  and  then  log-on  via the main status window (users can be
    password  protected  to  prevent unauthorised access). The multi-user API is
    currently  supported  by  a  range  of  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  Internet  software  including
    @{B}Microdot-II@{UB},  @{B}Contact  Manager@{UB}  and  soon  @{B}YAM@{UB}  (from  r7), with more in the
    future.
  * Multiple  providers.  Add multiple providers or provider configurations with
    ease,  then  select these providers by point and click, from the main status
    window.  You  might be testing two providers with a 30-day trial? Setup both
    providers and flick between them.
  * Access  control.  Parents  have full time/access control over each user. The
    system  manager  can  setup  time  limitations  (for example a user could be
    prevented  from  connecting  during  the working hours 09:00-18:00). @{B}Genesis@{UB}
    will  double-check  the  current time on connection, so that the user cannot
    temporarily  alter  the  system clock to fool software into thinking it is a
    weekend, for instance.
  * Advanced  time/cost logger. Shows each user access (or overall access), time
    and  date and the cost of this access. @{B}Genesis@{UB} shows statistical information
    to help you monitor Internet costs and time usage.

@{B}NAPALM@{UB} HAS BEEN FINALLY RELEASED!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's  been a long wait but it is finally over with the release of @{B}Napalm@{UB} for the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}.

@{B}NAPALM:  The  Crimson  Crisis@{UB}  is  an  all  new  real-time strategy wargame from
@{B}clickBOOM@{UB}.  Both  @{B}Command & Conquer@{UB} and @{B}Red Alert@{UB} featured high in the @{B}clickBOOM@{UB}
wishlist  that  they  ran, because of this it was obvious that this type of game
was something @{B}Amiga@{UB} users wanted.

The  game  is  set  in  the  near  future  in  which human made robots with high
intelligence  yet  very rebelious behavior attempt to take over the Earth, it is
your job to stop them.

The  game itself follows in the footsteps of the most popular real-time wargames
such  as  @{B}Dune II@{UB} & @{B}Command & Conquer@{UB}. It plays in a very similar fashion, where
two  armys  clash on on the battlefield. This can be either against the computer
or  against  another  player  with  two  linked  computers (via serial, modem or
internet connection).

To  win, the aim is simple. To destroy the other sides army, obviously, you have
a  massive  range  of  soldiers,  vehicles (from tanks to helicopters) and other
attacking  devices  at  your disposal. The fact that @{B}Napalm@{UB} is set in the future
allowed  @{B}clickBOOM@{UB} to implement very high-tech vehicles that are only limited by
there  imagination - some of these units will be of the like that has never been
seen  before,  however,  you'll  have to wait till the games release to find out
what  they  are.  To  enable you to build these buildings/units you will require
credits, these are gained by mining your surroundings for fuel.

Obviously,  the  1  player missions will be great fun with them not all being of
the  destroy  everything  mold but also with specific aims. However, as with any
other  multi-player  games  @{B}Napalm@{UB}  comes  into its own when played with a human
opponent.  @{B}clickBOOM@{UB} have put a lot of effort into this part of the game to make
sure that it doesn't become to repetitive. Many features have been added so that
even  when  it  looks  like  you are down and out there will be a way for you to
survive  and  come  back.  Many  options have been implmented that ensure a long
lasting appeal, there are many ways to attack, defend against, trick and destroy
your enemy.

The game is completly multi-tasking and OS friendly, it comes on CD-ROM only and
it @{B}Napalm@{UB} requires 16Mb of Ram.

@{B}DIGITAL IMAGES@{UB} UPDATE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}FOR INMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

Hello,

I  am  pleased  to  tell  you  that @{B}Space Station 3000@{UB} is finally on the road to
completion  and  we  are  hoping to have it complete next month. It will feature
some  amazing  @{B}Doom@{UB}  style  gameplay  as  well  as  many new and original ideas.
Benchmarks of the @{B}Doom@{UB} engine will be uploaded to our website very soon, but you
should  get  good  speeds  even with an @{B}030@{UB} and @{B}AGA@{UB}! All graphics cards shall be
supported  as well. A demo of @{B}Space Station 3000@{UB} will be released in less than 4
weeks.

Some people have been asking about the @{B}Syndicate@{UB} style game. Well, unfortunately
this  has  been  cancelled  due to certain things breaking up, but you can still
look forward to many of our other titles which will be on the way very soon.

@{B}Wipeout  2097@{UB}  is  progressing  nicely  and  we  hope to release a demo and some
screenshots very soon!

Best Regards

@{I}Stuart Walker @{UI}

YES, we know we should have called this @{B}v2.5@{UB} at the very least. It includes more
features than some other softwares do with major revisions. However, compared to
the amazing array of ground-breaking features @{B}Tornado3D V3.0@{UB} will have, this can
be  considered  a  minor upgrade. And it's FREE to all the loyal @{B}Tornado3D@{UB} users
out there!

The  new shadow-casting, clip-mapped surfaces allow for high quality integration
of real and rendered sequences.

@{B}Permedia2@{UB}  support  requires  @{B}CyberGFX V4@{UB}, which is a commercial product. Please
visit  @{B}Schatztruhe  Gmbh@{UB}  for  more  details  on  upgrading  from  @{B}CyberGFX 3@{UB} or
purchasing @{B}V4@{UB}.

Due  to  site  maintenace  we are unable to serve updates at the moment. Updates
will  be  available  again  beginning Febraury 23rd, 1999. We apologize for this
problem.

A LETTER FROM DONALD FELDBRUEGGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hello Angel Alvarez Diaz,

I  am  writing this short note to tell you that I enjoy reading your publication
"AmiChannel  News".  I  suppose you seldom receive any information regarding the
number  of  readers and how satisfied they are with the publication -- I thought
it  might  be  good  for me to write and tell you that I find it very useful and
read every issue.

Thank you for AmiChannel News.

Best wishes,
Donald Feldbruegge
