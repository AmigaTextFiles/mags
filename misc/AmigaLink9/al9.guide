Thats the talk around all the nets. And its true. This month we see true
Amiga Technologies news. By the time some of you read this Amiga 4000's
will be on the shelves already! 

After over twelve months wait we finally see light, Bright light. So
far I think the Amiga is back, Back from the dead. The game publishers
will see so many Amiga's being bought they will restart production of
their games(Thats if the Amiga pirates dont ruin it for everyone again)
We also have an article with Escom on TV! Escom/Amiga Technologies
had already announced North American distribution. 

Check out the Online-AmigaLink http site at : http://gnomes.org/amigalink/
Here you can read AmigaLink online send mail to me, And download past
issue's.

AmigaLink is also present on these FTP sites: 
gnomes.org   - Amiga/AM-LINK or AMI-LINK  (This is in East USA)
aminet.com   - We will try to get it back up here
We will also try uploading to aminet.com if we are sucessful you can
find AmigaLink in PUB/AMINET/DOCS/MAGS.

Why am I telling you all this? So you know if other places to receive
AmigaLink.

participation in the Video Toaster User Expo is a strong sign of 
their commitment to this market.  We are excited about the potential 
to make these creative tools available again."

"We anticipate an even greater turn-out for the second annual Video 
Toaster User Expo due to this recent addition of Amiga Technologies 
as an exhibitor.  This is what our readers have been waiting for," 
said Video Toaster User's Events Manager, Ann Pulley.

@NODE 2.3. "AT/Escom on TV!"
From: ttavoly@amiga.ow.nl (Thomas Tavoly)
Subject: AT/ESCOM ON GERMAN TV! Manfred Schmitt/Gilles Bourdin sighting
Date: Sun, 22 Oct 95 12:07:47 GMT+2


This morning, Sunday 22nd of Octobre, Gilles Bourdin and Manfred Schmitt
appeared on the third German television station WDR (West Deutsche
Rundfunk) announcing the rebirth of Amiga.

The presenters seemed pleased to announce this item of about a quarter of
an hour (or at least one, since at the end they use to hold up their
thumbs, saying "one bit for ..", one of them said _Atari_ (a little
spitefully it seemed), the other said Amiga).

First Gilles Bourdin appeared telling about the Amiga, it's multitasking
capabilities since 1985 and it's video/sound capabilities. The A1200 was
shown with a demo of Scala MM300 (smooth scrolling stuff with sound, but
not that awesome for the seasoned Amiga veteran :). This was shown on an
Amiga 1438S monitor (=Microvitec 1438 + builtin speakers).

Then they moved to the Amiga 4000 (desktop model, no tower in sight). It
was sitting in front of a bigger monitor (17" I think) also with the label
Amiga on the front, in the middle on the bottom. It seemed to have a lot of
icons and Magic Workbench installed, although not too much colour. They
didn't demonstrate anything on it, just told that it has the same
capabilities as it's smaller brother, the A1200, and you can expand it with
graphic cards, MPEG and whatnot, just like a PC.

Nothing was mentioned in the way of what processors were used and what
configuration was installed, except that the A1200 had a 170 MB HD.

Gilles made a relaxed and cheerful impression and they talked some about MS
Windows 95 = Mac 89 = Amiga 85 :^) Lastly Bourdin made the announcement of
AT/Escom being present at the Cologne show, taking place on 10-12 november
(World of Amiga 95)

After that a Commodore multimedia PC (midi tower) was shown, with a small
(but good looking) keyboard (MIDI, I guess) attached. The Qwerty keyboard
had two small speakers built in on either side at the top. They didn't show
anything of it's capabilities, just mentioned it. I'd guess it does
everything a normal PC does, bundled with some 'multimedia' software.

Then the camera moved to Manfred Schmitt, sitting with the other presenter.
He first asked Schmitt to tell what happened to Commodore and why Escom
purchased them. Manfred told him that Escom purchased Commodore and the
Amiga (he seemed to stress that), because of two reasons: Firstly the names
Commodore and Amiga have the second largest brand recognition after IBM in
Europe and have a good name, and also due to the size of this recognition
it is more difficult to change that recognition or image. (Sounded like a
tongue in cheek reference to the Amiga's bad reputation overseas)

Secondly: although Escom is one of the biggest customers of
Intel/Miscrosoft products on the European continent and they have quite
good relationships with aforementioned vendors, Escom regards them as being
monopolistic and therefore harmful to the market as a whole in the long
term. This is quite a big thing for a computer industry representant, he
might burn some bridges there :)

The presenter then asked if they were planning to break that monopoly with
the Amiga, and Manfred replied to the effect of: "certainly" :^) But he
also stated that he regards the PC as a workplace tool, for wordprocessing,
spreadsheet and the like, while the Amiga is more suited for multimedia
purposes. He again stressed it's capabilities regarding multitasking, video
and such.

Also the efficiency of the Amiga was spoken of, the way it's OS can run in
|512 KB, if need be from a floppy drive. Schmitt stated that today you need
|8 MB for Windows and 2 MB for an Amiga, and again stressed how much
advantage the price difference between a multimedia PC (2000+ DM) and an
Amiga (implying 1200, below 1000 DM) makes. Also the way the custom chips
make the design cost effective. That was good marketing ;)

The whole interview emanated a modern, 'lean, mean, fighting machine'
image.

Then they talked some about the recent purchase of [can't remember the
name, sounded like Hageka or Hakema] the telecommunications company. The
presenter asked a lot of quick questions whether the Amiga would also be
utilized in the communication business, to which I couldn't get a firm
impression, Manfred Schmitt gave some answers, but they were kind of vague
promising. (That and that I just got up and nearly fell asleep again by
this time..).

At the end Manfred Schmitt again stressed the Amiga's capabilities (they
seemed to talk little about Commodore :) and the position of
Intel/MicroSoft and the Amiga's future. The presenter vaguely implied (he
was guessing it seemed) forthcoming news next year regarding new models to
which Manfred answered with a subtle smile..

The presenter then closed the show with stating that in the future there
will be more Amiga items.

Manfred Schmitt made a relaxed impression too, it was a good interview.

I might be forgetting something here and there, since I'm still sleepy, but
thought you would like to know that finally they have come out of the bush
a bit and started marketing the damn product, even though nothing was said
we already didn't know. At least the general public now gets the message
(the show is quite popular in Germany, at least among the computing
public). BTW, I love those guys, they slagged off Windows 95 pretty badly
about a month ago, due to it's installation-horrors, unstableness and
bloatedness :^)

The show will be aired again tomorrow, Monday 23rd Octobre at 06:00 and
|23:45 CET. You might also catch it on the Astra satellite, though I don't
know which channel that would be (WDR).

This is new brief section that might make its way in bi-monthly or so...

Some good and bad news for you gaming freaks! :)

Colonization is out for the Amiga.
Sensible software has left the Amiga scene, And left us with an ugly
counting train game.

Mindscape planned to release Tiny Toons in october and Space Academy and
MegaRace in next summer.

Ascon(A UK developer) plans to release a enhanced version of Pole-
Position. (If I might add, The game looks very nice... Textured mapped
graphics, Probably A1200)

And for the worst news, MicroPose says Colonization will be the last amiga
game for some while, And plans for an only A1200 version of Pizza Tycoon
are undecided. (That should change, Once they see amiga's on the shelves
they will start making games left and right!) :)

@NODE 2.8. "Escom Suggestions"
                         |By: @{"John Vlachos" Link 8.1.}|
 
After seeing the prices last month of the new A1200's, I was thinking
why doesn't Escom have a Trade-in-Offer. Send them your old computer
and subtract that from the price of the new machines. 

OS suggestions

Well Amiga Technologies should offer Internet software with the new
OS. And a paint program, And of course a better writing program.


Some form of entertainment might be valued also. Even a simple pac-man
game would be smart to include.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 2.9. "Tech.Editor introduction"
                         |By: @{"Dale Poole" Link 8.3.}|



"Expert Required - Apply Within"

It's taken me about three months to get to this point in time.  When John
Vlachos originally made contact looking for a technical editor, I was
hesitant about taking the job.  I still am.

I was a journalist for 12 years so my hesitancy has nothing to do with the
actual writing - more with the term 'expert'.  Of course, John didn't say he
wanted an 'expert' - just an editor.  But somehow, the word has crept into
my mind and I want you to understand how I feel about the it, because sooner
or later, someone is going to say to me, "...you're supposed to be the
expert!" .

I am the first person to admit I'm an expert in nothing!  In fact, lately my
catch phrase has been "I know less nothing about anything".  I came to
computers later than most people.  My first unit was a venerable and used
C-64, complete with B&W TV.  I was a tender 25 years old.  My formal
training in the computer field started only three years ago.

Rather than being an expert, I have become instead, fairly successful in
ferreting out the details of what I needed to know.

"Okay then - Ferret"

Living as I do in Prince Edward Island, where Amiga is just another foreign
language word, trying to dig up information about my beloved computer has
been more 'exciting' than usual.  I don't have a dealer handy, and the big
population centers are at least 4 hours drive away.  The only Amiga magazine
to ever drift onto the newsstand was AmigaWorld.  As for subscription
service, National Geographic can't seem to find my address from month to
month, so how would a magazine for the world's best computer ever find it's
way to my doorstep?

However, the Internet has managed to infest my neighbor as it has many
others, and as it turns out, it's a pretty handy infestation.


"We're All Rodentia"

So the approach I'll be taking for this column is not that of the expert.
While I have a little bit if knowledge on a vast array of topics, I don't
pretend to know everything there is to know.  I'll try to lay down the
basics of a problem as I understand it, supply what information I can about
it, and then hit the circuits to find out more.

Of course, I expected you to help out.  Each of you is an expert in your own
right.  From the person who figures out the work around to a software bug,
to the person who discovers an obscure source of hardware that solves
another dilemna, your solutions will become the staple of this column.

"Where Do I Go From Here?"

So here it is, my first article.  Not much in it was there?  My editor tells
me my next snippet should be something about my computers and what they are
used for.  I'll tell you now, that doesn't sound too interesting to me,
possibly because I already know what I do with them.  
So in the spirit ofsharing, why not drop me a quick piece of e-mail, 
telling me what you use system for.

Feel free to offer a suggestion for a future article too.

@NODE 4. "We Need You!"

To write an article for us you do not need to be a Brain Surgeon, Or a
Journalist. You only need to be normal, Most people think writing
is hard, It never is. All you need is enough knowledge of how to
spell and where to put the words :). We accept all kinds of articles
that are amiga-related only. Exceptions can and will be made. 

Software Publishers: 
 You may send us products or press releases to review, E-mail the
 Editor-In-Chief for details. 
Editor's Last note : We love to get new products... If you include pictures
we will tag them along with the magazine if you like, Free of charge... A
free sample of the software would be great for us to review through.


Programmers:
 Do you wish to announce a new program? E-mail the Editor-In-Chief
 For details.
Editor's Last note: If you wish to send us something, First tell John
Vlachos what you will be uploading...

@NODE 5. "Editors picks"

 |AmigaReport|

  AmigaReport has proved that it is one of the best online amiga 
magazines(Besides AmigaLink of course :). Jason Compton, Editor-In-
Chief is well known for up-to-date news. Check it out sometime!


 |Text2Guide|

 Text2Guide is an excellent guide constructer, It only requires you
to learn a couple of commands. Created by Stephan Surken. 
 
 |The Amiga|

 From the A1000 to the A1200... Amiga's were always ahead of their time,
Even now when Ibm, and Mac's are catching up the Amiga still leaves them
to trail behind. Even through the Amiga has not been so popular, I believe
it will be. People will discover the magic of the Amiga, And leave their
other computer to collect dust.
