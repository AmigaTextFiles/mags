============================================================================

Hello again and welcome to another issue of WhatIFF?, the magazine that
is free but gives you so much! As I sit here writing at my A1200 I have
finally finished adding all the articles, reviews, guides and interviews.
It has been an exhausting summer here in Japan with the average temperature 
being 35 degrees, and as much as I enjoy working on my Amiga it has made it 
a bit of chore this issue, however enough of my moaning and onto this 
issue. 

We say hello to two new writers, Tristan Shiflett and Roald Strauss of who 
have contributed their expertise on anything Amiga audio related. Kevin 
Saunders is back with updates and John Scolieri has two guides regarding 
the fantastic PiStorm, Ivan Sorensen has a great piece on Amiga magazines
from the past today. Sadly Steve Lord was unable to make it for this issue 
however fingers are crossed he will be back for the December issue.

The magazine readership has been steadily growing and it has been a real
pleasure to have your comments. I have to give massive thanks out to
AmigaBill for doing a section of his programme on the magazine. It is a
real boost to all involved in the magazine when we see feedback like that.

Well  I will not keep you any longer, I hope you will enjoy this issue and
again if you you feel that you would like to contribute to the magazine
please contact us at: submissions@whatiff.info

@{b}Physical media FTW!@{ub}

Hello. My name is MisthaLu and I'm addicted to physical media.

At our house we have no subscription to any streaming service whatsoever. 
We cancelled Netflix looong ago after years of disappointment over the 
poor selection of movies. All we have now are DVD's and Blu-ray's. And 
that's what we prefer. 

Here's why:

@{b}Availability@{ub}
First of all, a lot of the movies we like to watch - classic 80's movies 
for example - simply aren't available on any streaming service. So in these 
cases there really isn't any other option for us. Granted, some older 
movies that we like to watch, can be found freely and legal on YouTube 
and/or archives, but it's always in some crappy quality version, and never 
with the subtitles we want. And sure, there's the option of illegal 
downloads - and then spend hours trying to find a subtitle file that 
matches that particular version of the movie. No thanks. We feel more 
comfortable sticking with legal options.

@{b}We Want The Directors Cut@{ub}
Movies are a big interest of ours, and we usually prefer watching the 
Directors Cut version of the movie, rather than the standard theatrical 
version. Usually the streaming services only have the theatrical cut, and 
that's just not good enough for us.

@{b}Ours To Keep@{ub}
We get to keep movies - in their original version. Streaming services are 
way too "unstable". Movies are removed from the selection without warning. 
Some are even edited decades after release, because someone somewhere got 
offended by something silly. You need the original physical media to 
prevent this silliness.

@{b}Quality@{ub}
Streaming just can't match the quality of Blu-ray FullHD movies. Not to 
mention 4k movies. 'nuff said.

@{b}Price@{ub}
Contrary to popular belief, physical media is actually cheaper than 
streaming services.

If you want a "full" selection of new movies, no single streaming service 
is enough. Expect to pay at least 3 service fees (and still not be 
completely happy with the selection of available movies).

Meanwhile, the newly released blu-ray version of the movie you're waiting 
to see on your streaming service, is available in stores for roughly one 
third the expense, or less (depending on how many streaming services you're 
subscribed to of course).

Older movies can be found on physical media - often still wrapped in foil 
- here and there for almost nothing. Often less than 1 EUR.

@{b}Display@{ub}
Many people will emphasise the advantage of streaming: All your movies 
doesn't take up any space! But if you're someone who actually prefer your 
movies to take up space, and be displayed on the shelves in the living-room 
for a cosy atmosphere, then streaming is not an advantage at all, is it?

@{b}No Interruptions@{ub}
With the DVD or Blu-ray we're not risking any annoying interruptions due to 
problems with the Internet connection or the service provider. While I admit 
this is rare, we did experience it quite often at one point, and it was 
extremely annoying.

@{b}Bonus Content@{ub}
Always nice to watch. Especially gag reels.
Yes I know you can always find these on YouTube, but as with everything 
online: You never know how long it'll be available, and you also have to 
watch 2-3 commercials before getting to it. Not worth it.

People who advocate streaming often argue with stuff like "Oh, but what if 
you take a break watching a certain show, and get back to it a month later 
- you can't remember how far you got! Streaming services remembers that for 
you!" Yes they absolutely do - and blu-ray does too! Even years after the 
disc was last played, the player can remember how far you got.

It is true though, that some blu-ray discs doesn't offer this feature - 
because the manufacturer can choose not to add it, for whatever reason. But 
the technology does support it. Even for shows spanning multiple discs - 
the blu-ray player will tell you which disc to insert, and start playing 
the next episode.

Even in cases where the manufacturer chose not to include this feature, 
there are still players - even DVD players - that remembers how far you 
got. So shut up already.

OmniPort - Multi port adapter for Amiga 1200

@{b}Available From@{ub}

@{b}Price@{ub}
25.95 EUR
  
@{b}Hardware/Software Requirements@{ub}
Amiga 1200 with free expansion port

@{b}Test Machine@{ub}
Amiga 1200/OS3.2/TF1260/Indivison AGA Mk3/A314-CP

@{b}Review@{ub}

Omni - of all things, is an adept for the adapter from Alinea Computer.

For most of the A1200's life the rear expansion port has been mostly
limited to SCSI ports or more recently video port adapters. However the
OmniPort is the first board to really make use of the free space at the 
back of the Amiga.

In the famous words of the Cat "What is it?" - for those who do not know
check out Red Dwarf series 2 episode 'Stasis Leak'. Well enough of my
Red Dwarf geekery onto the review ...

The OmniPort is a small board that can be screwed into your A1200 
motherboard, it provides two USB ports, one HDMI and one micro sd slot.
The HDMI connector is compatible with the Indivision AGA Mk3 and if you
have a Mk2 there is an additional cable available. The USB ports can be
used with RapidRoad USB or Subway USB card. The Micro SD port can be
connected to the internal SD card on a Vampire or interal IDE port with
an additional adapter. Those with A1200.net cases will be happy to hear 
that the board also fits without issue. The Indivision AGA Mk3 video port
unfortunately does not fit into the screw space on A1200.net cases so the 
OmniPort is ideal for those with a Mk3 and A1200.net case.

@{b}Installation@{ub}

To install the board you will need take off the top cover, keyboard and 
remove the floppy drive or Gotek. From here it is a simple case of aligning
the screw hole and tightening the screw. Another nice feature of the 
OmniPort is the included backplate which is available in a variety of 
colours to suit your case. I chose the transparent one as my case is an 
A1200.net transparent one. Fitting the cover can be a little tricky and
requires some considerable pushing. Once the board is securely tightened
and the rear plate in place, you can connect your cables. For my situation
I only have the Indivision AGA Mk3 to connect, which was the main reason 
for purchasing the OmniPort. Again the necessary cables were already
included and it was just a simple case of plug and arrange the cables.

Once the case was back on I could view my work, the transparent panel did
not match my case exactly it still looked a lot better than before. Having
the HDMI cable secured tightly is a bit relief and having the option of 
adding USB capability or changing my internal HD to an SD card is very 
useful.

The OmniPort fills a need that 10 years ago that would not have been
necessary but the numerous upgrades and addititions to the A1200 this 
little board has become quite the essential purchase.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

I have found that the Amiga has become a black hole of sorts, with each
passing year there are more and more ways to upgrade and keep your Amiga
current. And amid all this the poor A1200 becomes quite a mess of dangling
cables and wires. The OmniPort is something that addresses a need for 
cleaning up that mess. I find it to be very reasonably priced at 26 EUR and
adds a bit of future proofing. You do not have to add USB capablity to use
the card but if you do in the future then you do not need to suffer hanging
cables out of the case or worse cutting holes into it.

On a final note, I did not mention in the review the use of the OmniPort 
with the PiStorm. For those of you who have a PiStorm and use the internal
SD card, it can be a hassle changing the card. The OmniPort can be used with
the internal PiStorm SD card with a small adapter, negating the need to open
your case each time you want to change the SD card. If you have either an 
Indivision Mk3, A1200.net case, Subway, RapidRoad or/and PiStorm then this
board is a great addition to your Amiga. Thank to Alinea Computer for their
fast shipping and reasonable prices.

@{b}Review@{ub}

LED Adapters for the A1200 are two a penny, every Amiga shop is selling
their version of the board and with each company comes variations with the
board. For some reason I believed that we had reviewed an LED board in a
previous issue but after checking I do not see one. So this has altered my
review a bit.

To begin with, my LED light had stopped working due to being caught 
numerous times on the keyboard hole, the cable having been pulled out. At
this time I went in search for an LED replacement and found one by Sordan
for a great price, it also had the added advantage of having a plug at both
ends of the cable. However the cable itself was very thin and as I had 
suspected it eventually broke. So it was time to find another LED adapter
and one that was more sturdy this time.

Back in the day magazines would get sent stuff to review but with the market
being much smaller now we do not have the luxury of having things sent to us
for review. This means that we have to bargain hunt which in hindsight works
probably better for the reader.

So to make a long story short, I eventually found an LED adapter that looked
like what I was hoping for from AmigaKit. My main criterias were 1) a thick
cable, 2) plugs at both ends, 3) fits into an A1200.net case. The AmigaKit
adapter fit all three. The other added benefit of the AmigaKit adapter was
the option to change the colours of the LEDs. So for example if you miss 
the red LED for power from the earlier Amigas you can have that for your 
A1200. You are limited to red, yellow and green though. I chose green for
power, yellow for the floppy disk and red for the hard disk. It would have
been nice if they had more colours available however it is very useful being
able choose even out of the three.

@{b}From England to Japan@{ub}

Ordering from AmigaKit was a fast and easy process as usual, however I did 
run into their 'extended' processing time for orders which was quickly 
sorted after e-mailing and posting on EAB. AmigaKit is a great company that
has been around for a long time servicing us Amiga users when there was no
one else. Saying that, it is sad to see how their customer service has gone
down hill over the years.

Once the adapter was sent it quickly arrived, as usual their packing cannot
be beat. The adapter is very solidly built, there are two LEDs together but
it is difficult to see the line when in use. Installation was easy and there
were no issues with the lights fitting into my A1200.net case, there is 
about 2mm of space either side which was a bit of a dissapointment. The 
cable is thick and sturdy with the connector on the top of the board. This
made it a bit difficult to plug in the cable, especially if you have stubby
fingers like myself. Placing the plug on the side or below would have made
it a bit easier to access.

Once installed the LEDs were bright and nicely lit up my transparent case.
I was happy with the order of LEDs I had chosen but at the same time missed
the original green, yellow, orange configuration.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

Being able to unplug the LED adpater from the keyboard is a small but not
insignificant detail if you are often opening your case. The AmigaKit 
adapter is very good in this regard, the cable is strong, the lights are
bright and you can choose the order they are installed. Even the slightly
difficult access of the port on the board is not that much of a big deal.

If you are looking for a replacement LED adapter for your A1200 the AmigaKit
board is a good choice at a reasonable price, it is compatible with the 
newer cases and has a limited range of options and most importantly has a
thick cable and can be uplugged at both ends.

When you think of graphics in the 80s and 90s the Amiga arguably was the
leading platform with its 4096 colours available from the get go and
programmes such as DigiPaint allowing the user to edit photographs it was 
the machine to have. Almost forty years later and the rest of the world 
has caught up and surpassed the Amiga, making it irrelevant when it comes 
to digital graphics, or is it?
 
If we look at the later Amiga models, mainly the AGA machines the HAM-8 
mode is a great substitute for 24-BIT displays, tool that up with an 
accelerator and your old Amiga can become quite the image manipulator. 
What we need is modern software and while technically ImageFX 4.5 was 
released in 2020 it is still the newest commercial image processing
software the Amiga has. So, lets take a look and see how it has fared
after three years.

Originally I had planned to purchase the CD version in the hopes of
receiving a physical manual with it but it turned out that the CD
version was just that. As such I went for the digital download instead.
Purchasing was smooth through the AMIStore App Store. A-EON Technology Ltd.
had purchased the source code and future development rights from Woodall
Design LLC in 2015. The latest version runs on Amiga OS and Morph OS.
 
While the purchase went smoothly I did not receive my key due to the 
some issue with the screen update. However a quick e-mail got me sorted
with a download key.

@{b}Installation@{ub}

You have a number of options when starting the installer:

	* Install ImageFX 4.5
	* Install ImageFX 4.5 Extras
	* Install/Remove Hooks and Modules
	* Install AnimBrushes
	* Remove ImageFX 4.5
	* Remove ImageFX Extras Only
	* Install PowerStation

When you choose 'Install ImageFX4.5' another list of options will come up
and they are:

	* Install All Versions
	* Don't Install Optimized Versions
	* Install for 68020/68030 with Floating Point Unit
	* Install for 68040
	* Install for 68040 with Floating Point Unit
	* Install for 68060

Choosing the version suitable for your system is quite easy, the only issue
is if you have a machine with an LC060, in this case you will need to choose
'Don't Install Optimized Versions'. It takes a little while to install 
everything so during this time it might be a good idea to grab a drink or
sandwich.

Under ClassicWB I had no issues with installation and loading the programme
however when I tried to load up a picture be it a JPEG or IFF an error 
requestor popped up. After much head scratching it seemed that there is 
something causing an issue with my instaal of ClassicWB. To get ImageFX to 
work and load images I had to use Workbench 3.2 or BetterWB 3.2. Under 3.2 
images loaded without any issues. So please note that if you are running 
ClassicWB and want to use ImageFX 4.5 it might be worthwhile upgrading to 
OS3.2 first.

@{b}What's New?@{ub}

If you have used ImageFX before then the layout of 4.5 will be familiar, 
albeit now everything is contained with in floating windows. As far as I 
can see there is not too much difference regarding the filters and 
effects from previous versions. Clicking on `Filter` will present you 
with the following options: 

	- Dynamic Range
	- Histogram Equalisation
	- Colour Limit
	- Anti Alias
	- R.I.P
	- Video Filter
	- Median Filter
	- Remove Grain
	- Colour Balancing
	- Count Colours 

Comparing that to ImageFX 2, the filter options are exactly the same.

Distort provides more options however with the newer Image FX:

	ImageFX 2            ImageFX 4.5
	- Distort            - Displace
	- Wave Distort       - Wave Distort
	- Swirl              - Swirl
	- Warp               - Warp
	- Polar Blur         - Polar Blur
	- Mosaic             - Mosaic
	- Polar Mosaic       - Polar Mosaic
	- Spherize           - Spherize
	- Dream              - Dream
                    	     - Liquid
                     	     - Bubble 

Effect has also been boosted with three more options:

	ImageFX 2           ImageFX 4.5                   
	- Remove Feature    - Remove Feature
	- Oil Paint         - Oil Paint
	- Disperse          - Disperse
	- Roughen           - Roughen
	- Apply Texture     - Apply Texture
	- Straw             - Straw
	- Crystallize       - Crystallize
	- Radial Star       - Radial Star
	- Lens Flare        - Lens Flare
	- Paint FX          - Paint FX
	- Hockney Tiling    - Hockney Tiling
	- Lightning         - Lightning
                    	    - Film Grain
                    	    - Fire
                    	    - Sparkle

Aside for the additions to Distort and Effect, the major difference 
between Image FX 2 and 4.5 is the interface, layers and a more built in 
hooks. The updated interface is a welcome update and makes using it with 
a graphics board a much better experience. The ability to have numerous 
windows open makes for a faster workflow. Thankfully the visual overhaul 
has not made the programme harder to use, if you have used ImageFX before 
then you will be right at home with the familiar buttons and layout.
  
ImageFX is different from other programmes in how it handle file creation
an example of this would be when you want to create a new image/document.

With ImageFX you do not create a new file or document, instead you create 
a new `Buffer`, which can be done by clicking the `Buffer` button and then 
setting the dimensions, DPI, and RGB/Greyscale. Click on 'OK' and a window 
will pop up with desired settings. It is possible to load in a palette and 
apply it to your image or using the sliders set your own custom colours. 
I'll admit to it being a little confusing at first and requires more 
exploration. If you are used to the colour palettes in DPaint or 
Brillinace it could be a little intimidating at first. But we should bear 
in mind ImageFX is not an art package persay but an image processor. And 
this is where it really excels, the variety of filters, effects and 
additional hooks makes this the best image processor on the Amiga. While 
some of the actions can seem a bit clumsy by modern standards it still a 
powerful programme.

As a test in modern usage I loaded up some photos from a holiday. The 
photos were taken with a Nikon D3500, at the maximum resolution of the 
camera. Loading the image took a long time, around 2 minutes even with my 
TF1260 and PiStorm 32-lite connected. If possible using the onboard IDE on 
the TF1260 or the internal SD card of the PiStorm will make a difference 
in load times.

Once loaded I reduced the size to something more Amiga friendly. Dragging 
out the window will not enlarge the image, only the window. To do that you 
need to click on the (+/-) buttons. It took some experimentation and 
searching of buttons but I managed to distort some photos, cut them out 
and paste them into another image. Render times were fast, especially with 
the PiStorm, the TF1260 was slower but the screen update was faster. 
Hopefully a future update of will improve the chipram access and slower 
screen update.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

ImageFX 4.5 is a welcome upgrade, the new interface looks great, the use of 
layers and extra filters have all kept ImageFX at the forefront of Amiga
image processors. The ability to load and save a large variety of file
formats makes this the image processor to go to. With all that power comes
complexity and it will take time to learn how to use ImageFX to its full
potential.

At the beginning of the review I mentioned that there was no printed manual
with the CD, but there is an AmigaGuide manual included. It is a very well
written and layed out guide and I suggest you keep it on hand when first
using ImageFX. While it would have been nice to have some examples of how
to do certain tasks it is still very helpful. During my research I did
find a manual for sale on the Barnes and Noble website for 17.99 USD, but 
it is only an eBook title. 

If you are looking to do some serious image editing with your Amiga then
ImageFX 4.5 should be your first stop. It can be used with the standard
Amiga native modes or RTG and is very smooth on accelerated Amigas.

I came across the CD32 book during my times trawling through Twitter or as
it is now known as X(?!). Twitter is a great place to find out about new
Amiga projects and the CD32 Disc Reference Guide is one of them. Written
by AmigaJay it covers all 252 CD32 retail releases each with screenshots 
and a short review. The book is comes in at 260 pages all in full colour
and is a very portable A5 size.

There are two versions available, the PDF and physical book, the physical
book can be bought from eBay however due to the high shipping rate put on
by eBay I contacted AmigaJay direct to buy straight from him. He sent the 
book promptly with tracking.

First Impressions

The book arrived after about a week and from the outset looks very 
professional with a cover of Zool standing on a flying CD and part of a
CD32 in the bottom right corner. The cover is thick and glossy with the
internal pages matte but also nice and thick. You get a breakdown of the
contents on page 4.

	Games - 161 titles
	Entertainment - 19 titles
	Education - 4 titles
	Productivity - 21 titles
	Reference - 23 titles
	After-Market Games - 24 titles
	Cancelled Titles - 185 titles
	CD32 Disc Stats

As you can see the book does not only cover games but the whole spectrum
of software that is available for the venurable CD32. On each page you get
images of the game disk cover, rear, CD image, title screen and screenshot.
At the bottom right is a rating from A-F and a short paragraph of text
explaining a bit about the game and rating.

While I do not own a CD32 anymore, back when it first came out I was quick
to buy the Dangerous Streets pack, the book is a very entertaining read. 
Sometimes it is nice to have something that you can just dig into quickly 
have a look around and maybe learn of a new title that you can play on a
real CD32 or via emulation. I was surprised at the amount of titles that
were released in the CD32s short lifespan and more so the newer titles 
that have come out. It seems the same old story though with the newer
titles again not taking advantage of the CD32 hardware.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

If you have any interest in the CD32 then this is a great addition to your
bookshelf. You do not have to own an CD32 to enjoy the content and it is 
presented in a very pleasant manner. AmigaJay has released another book
the CDTV Disc Reference Guide which is a bit cheaper than the CD32 book
coming in at 3 GBP if you want to read more about the Amiga CD machines.
Releasing the book in A5 format was very smart, I think if it had been
in A4 the book would not have been as useful. As it stands the small size
makes it a very nice way to read about the games and other software 
releases for the last officially released Commodore Amiga computer.

Welcome to Aminet Goodies section, each issue one of our writes will list
their top 10 downloads from Aminet. For this issue there were no writers 
with the time to write up a list. So this time round I will list some of the 
fun utilities you can download for Workbench. 

1.  @{b}CaBoom@{ub}
    CaBoom is a utility that you place in your WBStartup and it recreates
    the exploding windows from the orginal Mac OS. You change the settings
    from the Tool Types when choosing Info on the icon. Pesonally I love 
    this as it adds a bit more class to my WB.
 
    => http://aminet.net/util/boot/CaBoom.lha

2.  @{b}PointerX@{ub}
    When the busy pointer was changed from a sleeping cloud in 1.3 to the 
    rather staid clock in 3.0 I was a bit disappointed. More so I wanted a
    busy pointer that was doing something while the Amiga was busy. There
    are several animated busy pointers available however I have found 
    PointerX to be the best. Simple and effective.

    => http://aminet.net/util/boot/pointerx

3.  @{b}BusyPointers@{ub}
    If you want a bit more customisation with your animated pointers then
    BusyPointers is the utility for you. The default busy pointer has a
    slightly different design to PointerX but you can also choose a 
    completely different style via the Tool Types setting.

    => http://aminet.net/util/wb/busypointers

4.  @{b}PointerEyes 4.4@{ub}
    For those of us computing in the 80s and 90s probably will remember
    installing a small eye utility that would follow the mouse. While 
    having no real use it was a fun utility to have running on your 
    Amiga. There have been a few released for the Amiga but PointerEyes 4.4
    is the easiest to install and shows up in the titlebar unlike some of
    the other pointer eye utilities.

    => http://aminet.net/util/wb/PointerEyes.4.4

5.  @{b}rewincy@{ub}
    It can get a bit hectic when you have several windows open on Workbench
    and the only way you can find a window is by cycling through the bring
    to front button. Rewincy is a great utility that can be copied to the
    WBStartup drawer and when loaded you can cycle through all the open
    windows by pressing 'Tab and Left Amiga' together. A very useful tool
    for when working in the Workbench.

    => http://aminet.net/util/cdity/rewincy

A rather short list for this issue but I hope you will find some utilties
that you have never used before or feel like revisiting. See you next issue
when we should have another writer giving their suggestions.

@{b}Review@{ub}

The original CyberPunks was released in 1993, available for ECS Amigas it
featured bold and colourful graphics, with cartoony characters. With the 
sequence released 30 years later we have updated and more "mature" looking
graphics. Having played the original in 1993 I had found it a fun but quite
a hard game, including the time limit.

So what has changed aside from there being a 30 year hiatus?

The main differences are that the game is now supports only AGA machines, 
you can have two players at once and there is no time limit. The game can
be purchased as a boxed game or digital download. I decided to go for the
digital download as I do not have the space for keeping boxed games though
the boxed version is tempting being only 6 pounds more. The gameplay has
stayed the same with a top down view, the player needs to shoot the baddies
and find keys to open doors, force field bypass circuits to deactivate the
security force fields and MediPacks if you are losing energy. This time
around if you pick up a MediPack it will affect your whole team. Collect
Gold and Siler Crypto to earn enough money to buy upgrades, use the map
to find your location and even gamble your crypto to give you the chance
to buy more expensive items.

There is a variety of weapons that can be found throughout the game, they
are:
	* Basic Assault Weapon
	* Orb Launcher
	* Twin Laser
	* Flame Thrower
	* Special Weapons, these can only be bought from the terminal
	* SmartBombUnit (use the spacebar to activate) Great for bosses!

@{b}How Does It Play?@{ub}

I found CyberPunks 2 to be a very enjoyable game, more so than the orginal
one from 1993. The gameplay has been made simpler, the graphics are good,
more about them later, the music and sound effects are very effective and
the gameplay is very nicely set. Quickly I found myself getting into the 
game and time quickly flew by. Before I knew it already an hour had passed
by, which is a great mark of a game. The control was tight and I had no
issues controlling the characters with my wireless Commotron pad. An 
interesting mechanic of the game is that if you want everyone to fire in
the same direction you need to tap in the same direction three times. It
took me a while to realise this but once I had it figured out it became
second nature. The first stage is not very hard at all but it is big, your
mission objective is to save AmigaBill from his alien captors and the level
ends in a hilarious scene with AmigaBill.

Each time you finish a level you are provided with a level code which can 
be entered from the title screen options menu. I was very happy to have this
since the levels are quite large.

The graphics have changed quite a bit from the original game and I am not 
sure if it is for the better. They look less cartoony and more 'kick ass' 
but considering this is an AGA only game it seems to lack colour and is 
very dithered. In this regard the original ECS game colourwise looks better
but the actual sprite design is better in CyberPunks 2. Things get better
in later levels but it still looks like an ECS game.

The music and sound effects are great, very catchy music suiting each of 
the stages. Sound effects are spot on and remind me of shooters from the
Megadrive and SNES, they have the same kind of muffled but bassy explosions
and shooting sounds. When shooting with the laser it is just pure auditory
bliss, reminding me of scenes from Aliens.

Will It Install?

CyberPunks 2 comes on two disks and is only available as an ADF, if you 
wish to run it from your hard disk you need to abide by the limited 
directory settings of:

	dh0:CyberPunks2
	dh0:Games/CyberPunks2
	dh1:CyberPunks2
	dh1:Games/CyberPunks2 

I found installing the game with the WHDLoad installer made more sense than
the suggested installation. Originally I had some trouble running the game
on my machine which is an A1200 with a TF1260. I found out that by disabling
the CPUSPEED SPEED=65 from my user startup allowed the game to run. Since
then I have had no issues. 

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

I had enjoyed the original and was looking forward to the sequel, the 
updated graphics while looking more like an ECS game work well. Moving
away from the cartoony style was a smart move. The gameplay has been
cleaned up and has made it more accessible and enjoyable. Overall I have
really enjoyed this game and having AmigaBill in it is just the topping
on a great game. Don't let the graphics put you off from videos online
or screenshots, this is a very well constructed game that oozes gameplay
and lots of fun. 
  
@{b}Pros and Cons@{ub}
+ Improved gameplay and mechanics
+ Very enjoyable shooter
+ Music and sound effects are spot on 
+ Large enough to keep you occupied for a while
- Graphics are good but there is too much dithering going on that makes
  it look like an OCS/ECS game

Gameplay: 8.5/10
Graphics: 7/10
Sound:    9/10
Overall:  8.2/10 - Incredibly enjoyable arcade shooting fun than sounds and

@{b}Review@{ub}

Last issue we had a look at NeonNoir a cyberpunk point and click adventure
game and this time around again we have another cyberpunk adventure set in 
2039 Boston. Exclusive to the Amiga it is available for free from Aminet or
the official website: www.nightshift.cx.

It will take a little while to download on a real Amiga as the game comes 
in at 23mb, however once you have it downloaded it is a simple case of
extracting the file and copying it to your desired location, no need for
an installer or WHDLoad. What makes the game stand out from the get go are
the HAM8 graphics and music. The developer has taken an interesting route
by not using mod music but streaming music from the hard disk. This makes
for a great soundtrack but also means a lot of hard disk access, so expect
to see your HD light blinking most of the time. It should be mentioned that
the game multitasks which is a welcome feature, as I write this review in
ProText I have the game running in the background, very nice!

After you have loaded up the game, you get a nice title screen with some
synthpop music streaming from the hard disk, you are unable to do anything
until the music has stopped streaming. Once it has finished you can choose
from the menu on the left, Start, Resume, Exit. Selecting Start will take
you to the first screen which introduces your main protagnist, Sean, along 
with a profile picture. The following three screens set the scene to which
you will be playing in. In  nutshell the United States has been divided 
into two nations, the FSA Federal States of America and the RNA Republic of
America. The game deals with the themes of surveillance and control by 
large corporations and governments. Finally another loading screen pops up 
with the text 'Chapter One: Night out', it is here you are introduced to 
the game proper with five action icons above, a picture of your bedroom on 
the right and text on the left side. The icons from the left provide the 
following actions: Game Options, Check Date/Time, Check News, View Map, and 
Use Phone.

From here is a simple case of moving the mouse around and click on hotspots,
when you hover above a hotspot text will appear on the left. Unfortunately
the mouse cursor does not change, it stays the same standard Amiga cursor
which makes it a little difficult to play. Used to the standard system
used in point and click games I was automatically expecting the pointer to
change. From here on you need to explore the game, clicking around the
areas, travelling via the subway to other parts of the city and meet people.
At the beginning of the game most locations are not available, you will have
to meet certain people and travel to other places before you can even go 
into the mall for example.

Once you get the hang of the game mechanics and how to progress it becomes
more enjoyable and the story is quite interesting keeping you in the edge
of your seat at times. Crypto currency features a lot in the game so if 
you have a even a passing interest in it you will find this a very 
enjoyable. The game can only be progressed by figuring out the puzzles and
riddles which means that it might be bit hard for non-native English
speakers to enjoy the game.
  
@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

I will not ruin the game by going over the story but there are few things
that I would like to address. The game looks very nice, the HAM8 graphics
are beautiful and really pop out of the screen. Saying that the music is a
bit of an issue, while it sounds great you are the mercy of it. For example
when you get to a new location the game will load background effects, this
effectively stops the game as the hard disk is maxed out streaming the
sound effects, you are unable to do anything during this time. This makes
for a frustrating and jolting gameplay experience.

However I would not let this dissaude you from trying out the game, a bit 
of perserverance and patience will reward you with a very enjoyable game 
play experience and a story with a lot depth. 
  
@{b}Pros and Cons@{ub}
+ Beautiful graphics
+ Great music and sound effects
+ Story interesting once it gets going
- Music streaming can be jarring to gameplay

@{b}Scores@{ub}
Gameplay: 7/10
Graphics: 9/10
Sound:    7/10
Overall:  7.6/10 - A beautiful looking game that is hamstrung by loading and
                   audio issues.

          @{b}How to install RTG on a PiStorm32-lite@{ub} - by: @{"John Scolieri" link johnscolieri}
=============================================================================

Following up on my Issue 10 review of my PiStorm32-lite accelerator in my 
Amiga 1200 I've decided to check out how RTG works on it. As there is 
currently no other PiStorm32 model (at least from the time of me typing 
this) and the 'lite' label was added to mitigate component shortage
problems at the time of it's release so to save a few keystrokes I'll be 
calling it Storm32 from now on :-)

Before we start you need to have either a second monitor handy or a monitor 
that supports VGA and HDMI or DVI or Display Port. Also it's important to 
note that RTG with Emu68 does not provide a flicker fixer or scan doubler 
so your system needs to already have one installed or you need to have a 
monitor that can sync to Amiga frequencies/ screen modes. I personally use 
one monitor with a HDMI splitter box as seen in @{"Pic 1" link  ExtraContent/Images/HDMI_Splitter.iff/MAIN} which makes it easier 
to switch from AGA to RTG modes though sometimes I still have to go into 
the monitors settings to switch from VGA to DVI modes which only takes a 
few button clicks.

So now that you have your monitor situation installed the first thing we 
need to do is to get a copy  of Picasso96 which can be found on Aminet:

=> (https://aminet.net/package/driver/video/Picasso96) 

or you can purchase the latest updated version which is still being 
developed today at Individual Computers website:

=> (https://icomp.de/)

Second thing is to download the latest VideoCore.card file at the 
Emu68-tools nightly builds website: 

=> (https://github.com/michalsc/Emu68-tools/releases)

With both files downloaded you can install Picasso96 from it's built in 
installer and make sure to click on one of the graphics cards on the first 
install screen (it doesn't matter which one as you'll have to rename it 
later on).

Continue with the installation clicking 'proceed' button at each step until 
completion BUT DO NOT RESTART your Amiga instead copy the VideoCore.card 
file you downloaded in step 2 to LIBS:Picasso96.

Next go to DEVS/MONITORS and you will find the graphics board you already 
chose on the first Picasso96 install screen. You can change the name to 
something else if you wish or keep it as it is as the name of the file 
itself doesn't matter. Next open the 'Information' about the graphics board 
icon and go to 'Tool Types'. Locate the entry "BOARDTYPE" and change it to 
"BOARDTYPE=VIDEOCORE". Now make sure to click save before closing the 
screen!

Now you can safely reboot your Amiga 1200 and go to your Prefs folder on 
your Workbench and open Picasso96Mode. Next create a new setting by dragging 
the "New Setting" icon to the Setting screen area. You can now give this new 
setting a name and attach it to the VideoCore board by clicking on the 
"Attach setting to" pull down screen at the top of the window (it should 
show Board0:VideoCore or whatever name you gave it). At this point you can 
choose and test the built in screen modes shown on the right hand of 
the window by clicking the "Test" button. Once you've tested screen modes 
that work with your setup save changes to Picasso96 and your Amiga 1200 will 
reboot. 

Now you can go back to your ScreenMode Preferences and you should see all 
the new RTG VideoCore screen modes listed which you can select and save the 
setting you wish and enjoy your PiStorm32 with Emu68 and RTG!

After using RTG for over a month now I can truthfully say that it works 
flawlessly with no noticeable lag or screen defects on all the programs I 
normally use. The only downside (which is rather minor) is that the AGA to 
RTG does not switch automatically as noted above.

         @{b}How to run Elude demos on a PiStorm@{ub} - by: @{"John Scolieri" link johnscolieri}
=============================================================================

How I got my favourite ELUDE demos working again after installing my 
PiStorm32-lite Amiga 1200 accelerator. 

With my 060  accelerator in my Amiga 1200 (running Amiga OS3.2) I just 
double clicked on the executable file form Workbench and the video started 
up great but this wasn't the case after I installed my PiStorm32 accelerator 
but with the power of IconX and TextEdit (or your favourite Amiga text 
editor) the problem can be solved as follows:

Note: For this example I'm running Elude's Kakao (AGA/RTG) demo released in 
2012 at Revision

 1- Open up your text editor

 2- Type the following line without quotes "eld-kakao -double -rtg" (if using 
    AGA type 'aga' in place of rtg).
   
    Note: eld-kakao is the executable demo file.

 3- Save the text file as "kakao-runme" (or click me 1st etc.) in your kakao 
    demo folder

 4- In Workbench go to your kakao demo folder and right click on the 
    kakao-runme text file created in step 3 and click on the 'Icons' tab at 
    the top of screen and scroll down to 'Information'

 5- Click on the 'Icon 'tab and click the 'default_tool' button and choose 
    "SYS:C/IconX"

 6- Click 'Save'

 7- Now you can go into your kakao demo folder and double click on the 
    "kakao-runme" file and enjoy the demo in all its AGA or RTG glory !

 8- Now you can do the same thing for all your other favourite Elude demos.

I've attached a few screen shots so you don't miss any spaces like the 
first time I tried and wondered why it wasn't starting ;-)

=============================================================================

If you are familiar with VistaPro then you probably have already heard of
DEMs, for those not initiated by VistaPro let me explain a little about the
DEM format. DEMs are 2D maps used by the U.S. Geographical Survey as a way
to describe terrain shape and elevation. The entire globe has been surveyed
this way including some planets in our solar system. Downloading and 
rendering pre-made DEMs is great but what if you want to create your own
DEM for use in VistaPro or even better in LightWave?

@{b}We meet again old friend ...@{ub}

Creating a DEM file is very easy, however you need to make sure you use the
right software for this. In most cases I work with Brilliance but for some
reason and the author was never able to find out why, ScapeMaker did not
like IFF files made in Brilliance. So you will need to load up good old
DPaint. ScapeMaker can import two sizes (258x258 or 514x514) of IFF files 
for conversion to the DEM format however since we want to save out the
DEM file as a LightWave object we are limited to former size (258x258).

ScapeMaker works by reading the luminance values i.e. dark and light as
elevation data, white being the highest point and black the lowest point.
It also has certain requirements regarding file size and bitplane depth.
24-BIT, IFF64, HAM or anything with more than 6 bitplanes will not be 
accepted. 256 colour or grayscale low-res to high-res however will
be loaded by ScapeMaker.

Armed with this information let's load up our old friend DPaint, remember
to set the image size to 258x258 and a maximum of 256 colours. However in
this case I suggest using 16 as we will be working exclusively in 
greyscale. Once you have DPaint loaded, we will need to create our pallete.

This is accomplised by using the menu, finding the 'Color' item, and 
selecting 'Pallete' and then 'Mixer' from the sub-menu. A new panel will
appear, set the last colour to white and the click on the black colour and
select 'Spread', click on the white colour next and a greyscale spread will
appear in the panel. You can now click 'OK' to go back to the main screen.

Now the fun part starts, remembering that white is the highest elevation
and black is the lowest draw an image, text, or logo. It might help to draw
on paper first what you plan the image to look in 3D to help with applying
the elevation values correctly. Save out the file as an IFF and then be 
ready to move onto the next part.

@{b}ScapeMaker@{ub}

ScapeMaker v4 is the version that supports LightWave obj creation, however
first we need to load the greyscale image we have created in DPaint. Once
you have loaded ScapeMaker you will see two black windows with buttons
above. Make suree 258x258 is selected and then click on 'LoadIFF'. When
you have first loaded the IFF nothing will appear on the screen, you
need to press 'MakeDEM'. A greyscale image of your IFF will appear, if it
is not showing the whole image you can select 'Region', your image will 
appear with a floating window, drag out the window to cover your whole
image and then click the close gadget. Click on 'MakeDEM' again to see
your whole image.

If you save your DEM as it is, it will be only saved as a VistaPro DEM to
save it for LightWave we need to copy some files into RAM before saving
the file. ScapeMaker v4 comes with 5 pre-formatted LightWave objects 
which need to be placed in the RAM disk when saving a DEM for LightWave.
They are a '258x258' sheet divided into 4 quadrants of 130x130 points of
which there are 4 of them as objects. The 5th and final file is a 
pre-formatted LightWave obj 'sheet' that covers the entire '258x258'
object but at half the resolution, which gives you an objct of 17,500
polygons. With these files in the RAM Disk when you save the DEM 
ScapeMaker will look for the files and automatically create a LightWave
object from your greyscale IFF image. From there it is a simple job of
loading the object into LightWave, coloring or texturing it and then
rendering. With this approach you can also import VistaPro DEMs and
convert them to LightWave objects to create spectacular scenes.

I hope you have enjoyed this short guide on ScapeMaker and LightWave
and as we reach our 12th issue after this one it might be time to
say goodbye to the LightWave series of tutorials for a while and 
concentrate on some other 3D software. If you have a particular piece
of 3D software you want to learn more about contact us and let us know.

@{b}The Quest For Less Noise@{ub}

I began my exploration of the Amiga Protracker MOD format way back in the 
early 90s, and have created many MOD files in the 30 years that has passed 
since then. It became a passionate hobby that I've kept exploring till this 
day.

Despite many new modern trackers being available nowadays, I still find the 
4-channel 8-bit MOD format more intriguing. The challenge in the limitations 
are simply more fun than having no limitations at all. So despite actually 
buying one of these newer and much more modern DAWs in recent times, I use 
Milkytracker to create my tracks 99% of the time nowadays.

It's been fun to be able to still discover new things about the MOD format 
even here in recent years. New techniques for making various effects. 
Alternative ways of putting things together. And most recently I began 
experimenting with ways to reduce the noise in the 8-bit samples.

Prior to these experiments I often asked around on various Amiga oriented 
chatrooms about ways to reduce the noise in 8-bit samples, but the only 
feedback I ever got was that it just wasn't possible.

Unfortunately I'm the kind of person who doesn't believe what people say. 
Probably because past experiences have taught me that most people don't 
actually know what they're talking about. The more they sound like they 
know, the less they actually know.

Therefore I often end up going on the quest myself at some point. And that's 
what happened in this case too. I wrote this article afterwards in order to 
share my discoveries with you.

Before getting started, I assume you know about the obvious:
- Make sure the 16-bit sample has a high an amplitude as possible. Even 
  consider using compression in order to boost the overall amplitude
- Likewise, don't fade the amplitude in the sample - use commands for that 
  instead.

Right. Let's get started then. Here's how to minimize the noise in 8-bit 
samples when converting from 16-bit.


The first (wrong) info
======================
If you search for something like "how to remove noise in 8-bit audio", you 
will typically get a lot of results explaining that you need to apply 
"dithering" in order to get rid of something called "quantization noise".

Aha... and what exactly is dithering and quantization noise then?

Well, quantization noise (sometimes also called quantization distortion) 
is the noise that is created when reducing the bitrate from 16-bit (65536 
distinctive sample values) to 8-bit (256 distinctive sample values). One 
technique for converting 16-bit to 8-bit is simply to truncate the 16-bit 
sample, which basically means to just take the 8-bit byte part of the 
16-bit sample. This means that a 16-bit value between 0 and 255 will be 
converted to the 8-bit value of 0. And the 16-bit value between 256 and 
511 will be converted to the 8-bit value of 1, and so forth.

In other words, each 8-bit value will lose precision with up to 255 values 
compared to the 16-bit signal - and that's what's called quantization - 
because every 255 values gets reduced to a single value. And it is this 
lost data that causes the noise. The noise is actually the sound of the 
missing data.

Ok, so what is dithering then, and how is that supposed to solve this? 
Well, dithering is simply the process of "adding random noise" to the 
signal in order to hide or disguise the quantization distortion, and 
give back the audio a more natural sound. It supposedly replaces the 
quantization noise with a "white hissing" noise - which apparently many 
people prefer instead.

And there are many different kinds of dithering. The most common one is 
called Triangular Probability Density Function (TPDF), and you can apply 
such dithering to your sound with the following SoX command:

sox 16bitinput.wav -b 8 8bitoutput.s8 dither -S

Ok then, so far so good. Sounds interesting. But when we search for these 
things online, we tend to forget a simple but important reality: It's not 
1995 anymore, and all of these articles about dithering are written by 
losers who doesn't even know what an Amiga is. They use socalled "modern 
professional" equipment, and often don't even talk about 16-bit to 8-bit, 
but rather 24-bit to 16-bit or even 32-bit to 24-bit. And the samplerates 
they use are usually 96 kHz or more.

Therefore, the dithering techniques they describe does not give the same 
results when targeting 8-bit 16 kHz, like we do on (stock) Amiga. Mainly 
because of the low samplerate we use.

The human ear can hear frequencies between 20 hz and 20 kHz, and is most 
sensitive to frequencies from 2 kHz to 5 kHz. Some people can even hear 
as low as 12 Hz and as high as 28 kHz. (And it is of course typically in 
this group you will find the audiophile people).

When you apply dithering to a 96 kHz signal - i.e. random small values on 
each sample value - it effectively becomes a frequency of its own that 
varies between 24 kHz and 48 kHz - meaning well outside the human hearing 
range. That's why it works. That's how you effectively move the noise away 
from the human hearing range.

Not so on Amiga though, because here we typically use samplerates between 
8 kHz and 27 kHz. If we apply dithering to a 16 kHz sample, we're 
effectively adding a noise frequency that varies between 4 kHz and 8 kHz - 
which is no where near outside the human hearing range. It actually happens 
to be in the frequency range we are most sensitive to. In other words: 
It's the exact opposite result of what we're looking for. We're not getting 
rid of the quantization noise, but rather just adding an extra layer of 
"white hissing" noise on top of the quantization noise. So now we have 
noise with extra noise, which is easy to hear on the TPDF dithered sound 
given by the SoX command above. Useless.

But wait. There is also something called "noise-shaped dithering". Let's 
take a look at that then.

Noise-shaped dithering to the rescue?
=====================================
Basically, noise-shaped dithering is where you try to shape the dither, so 
that it becomes not so random anymore, again with the purpose of moving the 
noise to a different frequency. A simple noise-shape dithering technique is 
done by subtracting each sample value (of the applied noise) with the 
previous sample value. Because this will give a bigger chance of a higher 
frequency. So for a 44100 Hz signal, instead of the noise ranging between 
11050 Hz and 22050 Hz, it will now be closer to 22050 Hz - which helps, 
because that's outside most people's hearing range. But for a 16 kHz sample 
on Amiga, it's still not a whole lot helpful. It'll merely bring the noise 
frequency closer to 8 kHz, which is still very audible to all of us.

For this reason, most of these noise-shaping dithering methods won't even 
let you process files with such low samplerates that we use on Amiga. The 
only one that will is called Shibata. And the SoX command looks like this:

sox 16bitinput.wav -b 8 8bitoutput.s8 dither -s -f shibata

It will be less noisy than the TPDF dithered output, but compared to the 
original truncated 8-bit version, it will sadly not reduce the noise at all.

At the low samplerates we use on Amiga, we don't have the option of moving 
the noise to a higher frequency outside the human hearing range. Our only 
option is to move it to a lower frequency. And SoX doesn't seem to do that.

Noise-shaping without dithering to the rescue then?
===================================================
There is another tool out there called "Shibatch Sample Rate Converter". 
Like most of the SoX dithering methods, SSRC also refuse to work with lower 
samplerates. Lucky for us though, I'm a super hacker, so I took a look at 
the source code, and did some messy hacking experiments with the options. 
(Basically I just changed a couple of numbers so that the tool wouldn't 
dismiss my attempt using a lower samplerate than those supported, but if 
anyone asks, I was a super elite WhiteHat haX0r Uber geek who changed the 
world for the better - or better yet: Say that it can't be done any better! 
That way, we know someone will invest loads of time and effort to prove us 
wrong and provide an even better method in the near future).

I simply changed one of the profiles to "54264 Hz -> 27132 Hz". So that I 
have to feed it a 16-bit 54264 Hz file, to get an 8-bit 27132 Hz file back. 
To do this I obviously have to convert my 44100 Hz file to 54264 Hz first:

sox my16bit44100hz.wav -D -r 54264 my16bit54264hz.wav

And then I run my SSRC command:

ssrc_hp --twopass --bits 8 --dither 0 --pdf 1 0.1 --rate 27132 my16bit54264hz.wav my8bit27132hz.wav

Notice I apply "--dither 0" which means I'm not actually doing any dithering 
anymore. This is all "just" noise-shaping. And that's probably the key.

I have no clue about inner workings of SSRC, but I can clearly hear a 
difference between this SSRC result and the previous SoX results - also 
when using 27132 Hz for the SoX command too. SSRC gives a much better 
result with far less audible noise.

The problem with these techniques though - both noise-shaping and dithering, 
is that it never actually removes the noise. It merely moves it to a 
different spectrum in the audio. And because it varies which frequencies 
different people hears best, there will always be some people who hear 
*more* noise in the samples where *you* hear the *least* amount of noise. 

So what do we do?

Well, the only thing we can do really, is to consider the majority and/or 
trust our own hearing as musicians and pick whatever method *we* find the 
least noisy. Googling around seems to indicate that most people are very 
happy with the results that SSRC produce. And I definitely agree, despite 
my messy "hack" to allow 27132 Hz output.

So SSRC is definitely on the list of useful methods to reduce noise in our 
MODs. But the downside is that it forces us to use a samplerate of 
27132 Hz... And that's another thing to keep in mind when using the SSRC 
method: As soon as you play the sample at other samplerates, the 
noise-reduction effect may disappear. It may even result in more noise than 
the truncated sample will give.

Manual noise-shaping
====================
Ok, so dithering is off the table. Dithering is no friend of Amiga. We do 
not like dithering. Noise-shaping seems to be the way forward though. So 
let's experiment some more with that.

SSRC is definitely on the list of useful methods, but surely we must be 
able to find more useful techniques? Preferably some that doesn't require 
us to use - and stick to - a samplerate of 27132 Hz. It would be nice with 
a method that can be used with lower samplerates, and which allows us to 
actually play the sample at different samplerates without losing the 
noise-reduction effect.

Let's take a look at manual noise-shaping on one of the most noisy samples 
in 8-bit: The sine bass.

I've created a few tools of my own that I use for this. First I use a 
little command-line tool to create a 16-bit C-1 sine tone in 16726 Hz. I 
then load this file with another small tool I made, which gives me a 
little simple graphical display of the 8-bit conversion along with the 
quantization noise that's created from the conversion (amplified to better 
see it).

Looks like this: @{"Image 1" link  ExtraContent/Images/image1.iff/MAIN}

I can then manually adjust each sample value in order to shape the 
quantization noise into something a bit more smooth or soft.

Looks like this: @{"Image 2" link  ExtraContent/Images/image2.iff/MAIN}

The result of this process is that the white hissing noise gets replaced 
with a harmonic distortion. The hissing noise is gone, and instead I have 
a socalled overtone mixed with my sine - which I very much prefer instead 
of the noise.

So to me, this is also a good solution for getting rid of the noise, and 
rather effective in the case of a sine sample. But it's not that easy to 
apply to all kinds of samples. The more complex the sound, the more 
difficult it is to find "pretty" shapes for the quantization noise.

The least amount of quantization
================================
For the next experiment, we will pick the sample values that results in the 
least amount of quantization. If for example we start at a 16-bit value of 
10, and the next sample value is 240. Then the least amount of quantization 
for the 8-bit samples would be 0 and 1, instead of 0 and 0 which will 
normally be the case for a truncated 8-bit sound. That way the quantization 
will be 10 and 15 instead of 10 and 240, which will logically reduce the 
noise a bit - move it to a lower frequency - but it will also change the 
actual sound. It will kind of constantly move the DC offset, and can 
therefore easily result in the sound moving outside the available amplitude.
Comparing a normal sound with the sound produced by this method, we can see 
how the sound wanders off and leaves the window.

Normal Sample:
@{"Normal Image" link  ExtraContent/Images/image3.iff/MAIN}

Sample with least amount of quantization per sample:
@{"Least Amount of Quantization Image" link  ExtraContent/Images/image4.iff/MAIN}

While it's clear for me to hear that the noise has indeed been moved to a 
lower frequency, it's also clear to see that this approach will only work 
for short sounds.

14-bit remains the ultimate solution
====================================
The final method on the list is the 14-bit trick, in which you need two 
channels and two samples. One 8-bit sample played at full volume + one 6-bit 
sample played at volume 1. This will give you a 14-bit'ish quality output, 
which gives the absolute best result of all the options - despite using 
lower samplerates.

So which method is the best?
============================
Well, the best method is the one that works best for the specific case. Most 
of the time, the best result is produced by using a mix of different 
methods. Because each method has advantages and disadvantages.

Method        | Advantage             | Disadvantage
--------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------
Dithering     | No advantages at all! | More noise
--------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------
SSRC          | Moves noise down      | Must be 27132 Hz
--------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------
Manual shape  | Noiseless!            | Harmonic distortion
--------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------
Least amount  | Moves noise down      | Wanders off
--------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------
14-bit trick  | Best result!          | Requires 2 channels & sounds
--------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------

The SSRC method is useful when needing to play snippets of recordings, e.g. 
when you have downmixed many channels into a single sound.

If you can't accept needing to use a samplerate of 27132 Hz for this - and 
if your sound is a short one - you can opt for the least amount of 
quantization method.

The manual noise shaping works best for short chip sounds.

The 14-bit trick has the disadvantage of needing 2 channels and 2 
instruments, but it doesn't necessarily require more bytes than the SSRC 
method. I've found this method to be rather good for creating basslines 
with far less noise than plain 8-bit bass sounds has.

And that concludes my noise-reduction experiments. I hope some of you found 
it useful. :-)

 	          @{b}Brilliance 101 Part 10@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

Hello and welcome back to the 10th part of the Brilliance 101 series, this
time round we are going to look at a very simple but effective tool if you
have only a limited palette available. Often you will see dithering used in
games on the Amiga and also on the Megadrive and SNES, it was a standard
tool/effect to be used before we have thousands of colours available in
game.

To get access to the dither settings you will need to find the 'Draw Mode'
button on the right side of the panel. A right mouse click will bring up
the panel. We will be working with the buttons 'Dither 1' and 'Dither 2'
and using the sider at the bottom. But first a quick explanation of the
differences between 'Dither 1' and 'Dither 2'. When you select 'Dither 1'
with the dithered pattern being the current selected colour and the areas
with no paint being always black. You can change the intensity of the 
dither by using the slider at the bottom on the panel. If you want a uniform 
dither then sticking to the values of 10 is a good idea, i.e. 10%, 20%, 30%
and so on.

With 'Dither 2' paint is applied to the image in a dithered pattern using 
the currently selected colour and the background colour. Like 'Dither 1' the
intensity of the dither is controlled by the slider. Of the two I find
'Dither 2' to the most useful since I can change the space colour between
the pixels to another colour. Please remember that if you are painting with
a background colour no dither pattern will appear as the dithered colours
will both be the same. 

You can use 'Dither 1' and 'Dither 2' with any of the paint modes, even 
with text, which can prove to be quite useful. Free hand painting with the
dither tool can give you some neat effects and it pays to play around with
it.

That is it for this issue, a rather short tutorial, however next issue we
will delve more into the 'Draw Mode' options and see what other tricks are
possible from there.

============================================================================

ImageFX is probably the best image processor there is for the Amiga, 
however with this power comes complexity and it can be a bit tricky figuring
out how to do things beyong scaling or adding simple filters. In this guide
we will look at creating a digital summer holiday postcard. While this guide
was done with ImageFX 4.5, most of what is done can be done in ImageFX 2.

If you anything like me then you probably have drawer full of photos from
your holidays. Being it 2023 they are most probably digital photos and
making our task much easier than 28 years ago. To begin with find a photo
that you want to be your main image, for my example I chose a shot of a
beach from Amami island. The photo is quite large, over 4,000 x 4,000 
pixels. Now while this is fine for modern day systems the old 2MB of chip
ram in your Amiga can barely hold an image that size, so either resize it
on your Mac/PC or do it the correct way, resize it in ImageFX. This is 
easily accomplished by loading the .jpg file, this will probably take a
while so go grab a cold drink and some snacks while you wait. Once the
image has been loaded all you need to do is click on 'Size' and set the
height and width. For our postcard lets use a high res but friendly 
1024 px by 768 px, once it has finished scaling save the file as an IFF.

Now we have to choose our other images that we will paste into the main
image. The same process as above should be followed but to help save
Chipram reduce the size of the images to 500 px by 500 px.

In my example I found a photo of the lovely breafast that we had eaten
at the hotel. What I want to do with the photo is shrink and create a
pespective effect. This can be accomplished with the 'Transform' button.
A window/panel will pop up with several types of transformations, select
'Perspective 3D Rotate'. A grid will appear over the image buffer, by
clicking and holding the left mouse button you can rotate the image. I
wanted to create an angled image, my settings were:

	Rotate X = 35
	Rotate Y = -34
	Scale X = -25
	Scale Y = -25
	AntiAlias = On
	Locked Ratio = On

Take note of Scale X and Y, this is very important as if you leave them
as is your image will be cut off at the edges. Using the slider you can
shrink the image so the edges will not be lost. Once you have your settings
as you like them, click on 'Preview' to see if anything needs to be 
changed.
	
Now we will need to cut out the modified image, I have tried in the past to
find an easier way using mattes but without a manual I had to try it another
way. If someone knows of another way to do this please contact me at the
magazine so I can update this tutorial accordingly.

So on to cutting the image, you will need to click on the 'Full' button and
select 'Poly', then draw an outline around the perspective altered image.
We need to cut out the image next and this is done by clicking on the 
'Brush' button, a selector will pop up and you will need to choose 
'Pick Up Region'. Next go back to your main image and you will see the cut
image has replaced the mouse cursor, find a spot that you like and press 
the left mouse button to paste it down.

To recap what we have done so far is to bring in our main image, the post
card background if you will, reduced it to a more manageable size. Then
brought in another image, reduced it, transformed it using the Perspective
3D Rotate, cut it out and pasted it on the main image. What we need to do
next is bring in some more pictures and do the same but changing this time
the Perspective 3D Rotate settings, experiment and use the preview as much
as you can to save time.

Once you have set your images its time to give the main image a bit more
pizzaz! Find the 'Effects' button and choose 'Lens Flare', if you left click
on the top preview image you can position the flare where ever you want, to 
increase the size of the flare left click, hold and drag the mouse sideways
to change the size. Use the Preview box at the bottom to see if you are
happy with the results and then click on 'Okay'. Finally to give our post
card a more postcard'ish look, find the 'Arexx' button, when you click on
it a requestor will pop up, choose 'Border.ifx', you can leave the border
width to 10 or more. This will put a nice white border around the card
making it ready to be sent to all your other Amiga buddies or uploaded to
Aminet. Here is an @{"example" link  ExtraContent/Images/TestImageFX.iff/MAIN} of the results you should expect.

That ends our first ImageFX guide, I hope you found it useful. Right I am
going to go and grab a cold drink before I melt before my Amiga in this
summer heat. Until next time, Amiga Forever!

   @{b}How To Create Modern Effects In Oldskool Trackers @{ub} - by: @{"Roald Strauss" link roaldstrauss}
============================================================================

Many of the modern DAWs available nowadays comes with a lot of built-in 
effects, we can use: Echo, reverb, phaser, lowpass filter, highpass filter 
etc. All with "automatisation" options too, which allows you to change the 
levels of the effect dynamically. Fancy stuff!

But for some of us, the oldskool way of tracking just remains the most 
appealing and intriguing option. Producing oldskool formats like MOD, XM, 
S3M and IT that can be used on older classic platforms, instead of creating 
the bigger sized streamed formats that can only be used on the more modern 
platforms.

But these old formats generally doesn't offer such fancy effects options, 
so what do we do there? Simple: You simulate the effects.

In this article I will describe how you can achieve the following cool 
effects in these old formats - even in the 8-bit 4-channel MOD format:
@{i}
- Echo
- Reverb
- Phaser
- Surround sound
- Lowpass filter
- Highpass filter
- Bitcrunch
- 14-bit quality in an 8-bit MOD
@{ui}
There are of course many other kinds of effects you can create with the old 
formats, such as Timestretch (using 9xx). But this article is not about the 
available built-in effects-commands. This article is about how to achieve 
other effects that isn't officially supported by the format(s) with effect-
commands, but rather effects you can achieve mostly by playing two samples 
at the same time.

Now, obviously you can always achieve most of these effects simply by 
merging the effect into the sample itself: Load the sample into Audacity 
and apply the effect. Then replace the boring-effectless-sample with this 
new sample-with-awesome-effect in your track.

And I'm not saying that's a wrong way to do it in some cases. I use this 
approach myself sometimes, depending on the effect and the track. But 
merging the effect(s) into the sample will give a rather static result - 
always the same amount of the effect. And that's not an optimal solution 
in my humble opinion.

In this little guide, we'll focus is on how to achieve a more flexible 
version of these effects, where you can adjust the levels dynamically in 
your track, thus ending up with much more variation of the effect.

@{b}1. Echo@{ub}

The most simple of them all. All tracker musicians (should) already know 
about this one. It is no doubt the most used effect in the list, and no 
one would ever think about merging this effect into the sample. I'm just 
including it here to make it a complete list.

To add an echo to a channel, simply copy the channel of the pattern to 
another channel - insert a few empty rows at the top for the delay, and 
reduce the volume of all notes. That's all there is too it. And you can 
do this multiple times, thus using multiple channels to produce a bigger 
echo effect.

You can also add some panning on the echo-channel(s) (if supported by the 
format), to enhance the echo-effect further.

The dynamics of this effect can thus be controlled with the volume and 
panning of the echo channels, and of course how many channels you want to 
use.

You can hear an example of such an echo effect in my track:

	Happy_Sunrise_HQ_8bit.mod 
	=> https://www.indiegamemusic.com/5098

@{b}2. Reverb@{ub}

To create a dynamic reverb, we first need to produce a sample of a reverb.

Load your sample into Audacity, and apply some heavy reverb effect. If the 
effect is strong enough, the actual instrument will be almost gone, and 
only reverb will be left - which is what we're going for here.

Normalise and apply Compressor a few times to boost the reverb. Then create
or find some good loop points, so the reverb continues forever.

This way you'll have a reverb sample to go with your actual instrument. 
We're not merging the reverb effect with the sample in this approach. We're 
merely producing a separate reverb sample to use. One that is really loud, 
and thus needs to be played in a different channel at a low volume.

What's the difference in the actual result, you ask? Well there are two 
advantages with this approach: First, you can now adjust the level of 
reverb you want, in the actual track using volume commands, rather than in 
the sample. This can thus be dynamic through-out the whole track.
Second, because the reverb sample is normalised and compressed, and thus 
played at a very low volume, it'll practically be noiseless in an 8-bit MOD. 
Had we instead merged a low reverb effect into the sample, it would have 
been rather noisy in an 8-bit MOD, due to the mix of low amplitude and 
quantization noise.

The dynamics of this effect is thus controlled by the volume of the reverb 
sample, and how many channels you use. An instrument that only uses 1 
channel, could easily use 3 additional channels for the reverb sample.

But we only have 4 channels available in Protracker of course. So in an 
alternative approach that only use a single channel, we can merge the two 
samples together: Merge the instrument sample with the compressed and 
normalized reverb sample. This approach is mostly useful for short 
instruments though, and the idea is that you fade the volume of the sample 
to reduce reverb. The more reverb you want, the less you fade the sample.
The advantage with this approach is that you only have to use a single 
channel. You can hear an example of such a dynamic reverb effect in my 
track: 

	Connections-MOD
	=> https://www.indiegamemusic.com/5430

@{b}3. Phaser@{ub}

A phaser effect is achieved by playing the same sound in 2 channels 
slightly out of phase.

In case of a looped synth/chip sample, a phaser effect can be achieved by 
copying the instrument to another instrument, and adding a finetune on one 
of them. Playing both samples at the same time will then create a looping 
phaser effect. And because we used finetuning on the instrument, we have 
the effect column completely free for other effects.

Alternatively, you can use the same sample in both channels, using 
finetuning effect command on one of them. For a MOD you can use commands 
E1x and E2x. For an XM there's Xxy available for even finer tuning. You can 
also get some funky effects with 4xy. Any command that controls vibrato and 
portamento makes the dynamics of this effect.

@{b}4. Surround Sound@{ub}

You can turn the phaser effect into a surround sound'ish effect simply by 
panning each channel to each speaker.

@{b}5. Lowpass Filter@{ub}

Low- and highpass filters are essentially the removal of high or low 
frequencies. To create a dynamic lowpass filter on a certain sample, first 
load the sample in Audacity and apply a highpass filter. (Yes, you read 
that right - apply the opposite filter of what you want in your track).

Then invert the sample (also known as boosting the volume minus 100%).

Now load this highpassed inverted version of your sample into your tracker, 
and play it with the original sample at the same time. Make sure they're 
both panned the same.

You will now only hear the low frequencies of the sound, because you're 
playing the inverted high frequencies of the same sound at the same time 
with the same panning, effectively removing the high frequencies, thus 
resulting in a lowpass filter. Setting volume on the inverted high 
frequency sample will determine how much of the high frequencies to filter 
away. Full volume = All high frequencies removed. Low volume = Very little 
high frequencies removed.

Creating a lowpass filter this way will give you

- One normal sample
- One highpassed sample
- Dynamic lowpass result

You can hear an example of such a low pass filter done this way in my 
track: 

	Unshackled.xm
	=> https://www.indiegamemusic.com/4797

That's 64 levels of lowpass + 1 level of highpass.

This approach requires 100% precise timing of the player though. 
(Read more about that later). For an alternative way of achieving a 
simulated lowpass filter, you can simply create the lowpass sample in 
Audacity, and play that together with the normal sample, slowly decreasing 
volume of one while increasing volume of the other. That approach won't 
require precise timing, but you'll miss the highpassed sample as the other 
approach will give you.

@{b}6. Highpass Filter@{ub}

To create a highpass filter is done the exact same way as the lowpass 
filter, except of course you select the lowpass filter in Audacity instead 
of the highpass filter.

Any equaliser effect you want to dynamically filter out can be achieved 
this way.

You can hear an example of a high pass filter done this way in my 
track: 

	Back_to_Basics.xm
	=> https://www.indiegamemusic.com/3352

@{b}7. Bitcrunch@{ub}

A bitcrunch effect can be achieved much the same way as the low- and 
highpass filters are done. Simply run your sample through a filter that 
cuts off the upper or lower bits, depending on what effect you want. Then 
invert the sample, and play both at the same time. Again you have the 
dynamics available by adjusting volume of the effect-sample.

For example, you could split an 8-bit sample into two 4-bit samples, 
producing a rather rough noisy sound, that you can slowly fade away and 
back using the volume.

outbytelow = (inbyte & 0x0f);
outbytehigh = (inbyte >> 4);

@{b}8. 14-bit quality in an 8-bit MOD@{ub}

The same way you can play two 4-bit samples in an 8-bit environment to 
produce 8-bit sound with the bitcrunch effect, you can also play two 8-bit 
samples in a 16-bit environment to produce 16-bit sound. This may not sound 
a whole lot interesting at first. Why split up a 16-bit sound into two 
8-bit samples like that? Because: This technique also works on certain 
older platforms, such as the Amiga, where you officially only have 8 bits 
available, but technically the Paula soundchip is capable of more: It can 
achieve 14-bit'ish quality. I will skip the technical explanation, and just 
say that you can - by splitting a 16-bit sample into an 8-bit part and a 
6-bit part - actually get 14-bit'ish quality on Amiga. (The "ish" part 
means "Definitely much better than 8-bit, but probably not quite true 
14-bit"). And who wouldn't love that bass to be less noisy?

A 16-bit sample consists of sets of 2 bytes. Shift the first byte of each 
set 2 bits to the right, and save all these bytes as "6bit.raw". Save the 
other byte as "8bit.raw".

Play the 8-bit sample at full volume, and the 6-bit sample at volume 1.

outbyte6bit = (inbyte1 >> 2)
outbyte8bit = inbyte2

You can hear an example of and 8-bit MOD with 14-bit quality in my track:

	Happy_Sunrise_HQ_14bit.mod 
	=> https://www.indiegamemusic.com/5098
and also in: 

	Sneaky_Chick_14bit.mod
        => https://www.indiegamemusic.com/5052

(Try turning on/off channel 3 in Sneaky Chick to the difference.) 

A note about low/highpass filter, bitcrunch and 14-bit

Low- and highpass filters, as well as bitcrunch and the 14-bit trick all 
require precise timing in order to work, because the two samples has to 
play 100% synchronised.

This is not a problem for the XM, S3M and IT format, since all trackers 
and playerlibs for those formats has such a precise timing.

But trackers and playerlibs for MOD files sadly aren't consistent when it 
comes to precise timing. In other words, these tricks won't work with all 
trackers and playerlibs for the MOD format. So if you insist that your MODs 
must play correctly everywhere, you should avoid using these tricks.

But if you only need your MODs to play correctly in the productions where 
they're actually used, go ahead and use these tricks all you want. Just make 
sure the playerlib thati s used, handles the MOD(s) correctly. This can be 
done simply by listening to the track(s) when played in the game.

I've had game-developers help me test playback of MODs using these tricks 
on various platforms, and so far it seems that the only platform that has 
issues is the Amiga, and only with Protracker 3.x
 
Protracker 2.3d handles them fine. Same with Hippoplayer and Delitracker. 
EaglePlayer only handles the tricks for the right speaker though. The built
-in playerlib in AMOS also supports them fine, tested on A500 and A1200.

So I'm seeing a lot more players that support these tricks, than players 
that don't.

Now go have fun playing with these effect-simulations. :-)

============================================================================
         @{b}Custom Music vs Stock Music@{ub} - by: @{"Roald Strauss" link roaldstrauss}
============================================================================

There comes a time in any ongoing game development project, where the game
-developer has to make up his mind about whether he wants to find a 
musician to do custom music for his game, or if he can settle for the stock 
music alternative; finding existing ready-to-use tracks in the style and 
mood that matches the game.

Meanwhile, all the world's musicians have the exact same choice to make: 
They must also decide whether they prefer to do project work or stock music.
The target platform doesn't matter. Whether it's a homebrew game for a 
classic platform like the Amiga, or a commercial game for a modern platform, 
it's still the same decision both parties has to make.

From the game-developer's perspective, having custom music tailored to the 
game obviously sounds tremendously appealing. "What could possibly fit my 
game more than music that has been specifically written for it?"

But it's not always the holy grail the majority seems to think: The 
musician doesn't always live up to the vision and expectations of the game
-developer, and sometimes it sadly doesn't take more than that for the whole 
project to slowly crumble and collapse. In the case of a commercial project, 
custom music is usually also much more expensive than the stock music 
alternative.

From the musician's perspective, project work typically pays a lot more than 
stock music does. But it also requires much more time and effort to create - 
and being instructed on how to do the music can often kill the passion, 
which can easily affect the quality of the end result.

These pitfalls doesn't automatically render project work useless of course. 
There are lots of game-developers and musicians who manage to avoid these 
problems, and have a thriving teamwork for many years. I'm merely saying it 
shouldn't be considered a bullet proof golden path to succes.

For me personally, as a much bigger artist than businessman, I basically 
want an approach that lets me stay passionate about my music - which means 
I absolutely have to have the freedom to create exactly the style and mood 
I feel like, when and how I feel like it, in my own pace, for whatever 
platform(s) I feel like, in whatever filetype(s) I find interesting at the 
time, and without having a stressing deadline to worry about. It's all 
about artistic freedom for me: I just want to make the music that I want to 
make, when I want to make it. And then game-developers can take it or leave 
it. It would of course be nice to be able to earn a little pocket money on 
my music, but all the other factors weigh a *lot* more. I am *much* more of 
an artist than a businessman.

While wanting all of those things for myself, I of course also realise that 
the game-developer has a similar list of things *he* wants: Be able to 
acquire high quality music that fits his game perfectly, with a matching 
genre and mood, in the filetype that his platform and development 
environment requires, that has a certain max filesize, max channel use to 
leave room for sfx, all at a low cost - and of course delivered before the 
deadline.

So the question is: Does such a model even exist? A single recipe that 
delivers all the wishes from both parties at the same time, despite having 
such opposite interest?

In my experience: *Yes!* That is *exactly* what stock music can do for both 
parties.

I've been composing music for over 30 years now, and have been offering my 
tracks to game-developers via IndieGameMusic.com for half of that time.

Here's what I've learned during those 15 years.

In reply to the most frequent statement I keep hearing in the "custom music 
vs stock music" debate: "Stock music will never fit the game as well as 
custom tailored music".

Well, apart from the already mentioned pitfalls with that approach, I've 
simply lost count on how many times I've put a stock track of mine online 
at IndieGameMusic.com thinking "This doesn't sound like game music at all. 
No one will ever request this track", only to be contacted 6-12 months 
later by a game-developer with the words: "Wow! This track is literally 
*perfect* for my game!"

The first couple of times I experienced this, I was rather surprised, 
because I hadn't expected anyone to find that track usable at all - and 
definitely not decidedly "perfect". But over time it made more and more 
sense to me. Of *course* that track is perfect for his game. It makes all 
the sense in the world. The keyword being "world" here.

*Any* track anyone makes will of course be perfect for *some* game out 
there in the big world. It's merely a matter of how long it takes for that 
particular game-developer to decide to create this game of his, and 
subsequently how long it takes for him to find the track online. And 
IndieGameMusic.com has a ton of search options to help the game-developers, 
so that part shouldn't take long.

And that's it really. That's the short and simple explanation of how stock 
music becomes an equally good option as custom music, for both the game-
developers and musicians.

"But what if the game-developer wants exclusive music then", I hear someone 
yell out in the back. "Yeah! And how can the musician even earn a decent 
penny with this approach?", someone else joins in.

The answer to both of those questions is: "Licenses".
Just because we're talking stock music doesn't mean the game-developer 
can't get exclusive tracks. IndieGameMusic.com gives both parties plenty of 
options here:

If money is of no object to the game-developer, and if he insists on being 
the only one in the world using the track(s) for his game, then he can 
search for tracks available with an Exclusive Resale license. Tracks that 
hasn't been used for anything yet can be offered exclusively, and they will 
usually still only cost about half the fee that the equivalent custom music 
would cost.

Should the game-developer wish to pay even less, he can go for a mix of a 
Non-exclusive Resale license + a Platform Exclusive license for the 
specific target platform of his game. Buying the Platform Exclusive license 
prevents other game-developers from using the same track on the same platform.
For newer platforms, this will typically cost the game-developer about 25% 
of the fee he would have payed for the custom music equivalent. And for the 
older classic platforms, such as the Amiga, it's typically less than 10% of 
the price for custom music.

Going even cheaper than that, the game-developer can also choose to settle 
for a Non-exclusive Resale license (without a Platform Exclusive license). 
Tracks sold with this license can be sold many times to many different game-
developers on many different platforms, which is why the price is typically 
only between 5 EUR and 20 EUR per track. And that's why this license is the 
most attractive one for both parties. Many sales for the musician, and very 
inexpensive for the individual game-developer. But obviously not a solution 
for those game-developers who want the music to be solely associated with 
their game.

Finally, there are also quite a lot of musicians who offers their tracks 
with a Freeware license. This means game-developers may request to use the 
track free of charge *if* their game is also free of charge. Notice that 
this license requires that the game-developer doesn't make money on the 
game in any way.

So as you can see, there's a *lot* of flexibility with usage and prices.

"Ok ok, but how does the musician earn a decent penny on this then?"

Simple: By offering a Non-exclusive Resale license + several Platform 
Exclusive licenses for his tracks. That way, the musician only needs to 
sell this combination of licenses 3-4 times in order to have earned the 
same he would have made on doing the same track as a custom one.
Or alternatively, sell the Non-exclusive Resale license alone 10-20 
times.

To increase the chances of selling a track multiple times, it's a good 
idea for the musician to make the track available in a filetype that can 
actually be used on multiple platforms - and/or make it available in 
multiple different filetype formats - and/or make it available in multiple 
different qualities and filesizes. In other words: The musician must engage 
himself in the impossible mission of "pleasing everyone". Did you make a 
4-channel 8-bit Protracker MOD below 80 kb? Then you can convert it with 
SNESMOD to a format compatible with the Super Nintendo. You can also use 
Timidity to convert to MIDI, or use 2MIDI from Un4Seen to convert to a 
MIDI+SF2 soundfont.

Offering the track in many different filetype versions logically increases 
chances of selling the track multiple times to different game-developers on 
different platforms. But it also increases chances of selling the track 
exclusively - to game-developers who is targeting multiple platforms with 
their game-project, and thus needs the same track(s) to be compatible with 
many different audio systems. Additionally, some game-developers who are 
targeting a classic platform, such as the Amiga, sometimes has to settle 
for a lower quality version of the music in the game itself, because of 
memory / channel / bitrate / samplerate limitations, and therefore 
sometimes want to include a CD with the soundtrack in a better quality with 
the physical release.

So to summarise: I recommend that the musician tries to offer his tracks in 
both WAV, MP3, OGG, XM, MOD and more if possible - all in multiple 
different bitrates and samplerates and qualities.

"Fine, but how often does the musician sell 3-4 Platform Exclusive licenses 
then? Or 10-20 Non-exlusive Resale licenses?", the sceptic continues.

I admit, this is something that requires a lot of waiting. But it does also 
depend on the track of course - and luck. I've sometimes sold a license 
just a few days after putting the track online, but at other times it took 
2 years before I sold one.

This time span between sales is the only "cost" of choosing to do stock 
music instead of project work. But then again, I don't see how that differs 
a whole lot from the time the musician would sit around waiting to get 
hired for project work.

Of course, the target platform(s) matter too. As a musician, I'm obviously 
not expecting to get rich of making MOD files for Amiga games. I create 
those filetypes purely out of the nostalgic passion for my childhood 
computer, and also because I want to support game-developers on the classic 
platforms in general.

But it's not completely impossible to earn some pocket money on the old 
formats either. I'm actually seeing quite a lot of interest in the MOD 
format. Admittedly not so much from Amiga game-developers though. My 
biggest MOD customers are actually Atari Jaguar developers. Gotta love 
that MOD can be used on so many platforms. But I hope to hear from more 
Amiga game-developers in the future. ;-)

Here at the end, I would like to encourage all Amiga composers out there 
to put your MODs on display at IndieGameMusic.com. Help out the game-
developers on the Amiga (and other classic platforms) find music for their 
future projects, by building a nice stock music library with the filetypes 
they need. Thank you.

    	@{b}Amiga Magazines - Yesterday Today@{ub} - by: @{"Ivan Sorensen" link ivansorensen}
============================================================================

Greetings Checkmarks. Today I am going to talk about Amiga magazines and 
specifically as an Amiga fan in 2023.

Growing up in Denmark, we did have a couple of computer magazines with an 
interest in the Amiga, the most notable being the magazine known as Det Nye 
COMputer (among a few name changes) before the castle walls finally fell 
and it transitioned to being a PC-only magazine.

This was a decent magazine with the usual mixture of productivity articles, 
game reviews, hardware reviews, industry interviews and so forth. Not a bad 
magazine at all really, though the level of professionalism certainly 
varied over the lifespan. The letters page was often quite lively with the 
Amiga vs PC debates of the day.

However, I did not have a chance to look at the UK and US Amiga 
publications until many years later when I was able to find scanned archives 
of them online (many are available on archive.org these days). I have come 
to quite appreciate these magazines and so I wanted to talk about what they 
can offer you, from the perspective of someone living in 2023 and reading 
many of them for the first time.

Of course, the most immediate use is nostalgia: Reading about various 
pieces of kit that were being released, marvelling at the prices of a 
20-megabyte hard drive and revelling in the excitement of the Amiga 3000 
announcement. Nostalgia often gets a bad reputation in retro computer 
circles, but I think we are all prone to indulging in it at times, 
especially for something that was often a formative experience in our 
relationship with technology. And I suspect you are mentally better off 
spending an hour reading about Kickstart 1.3 than spending an hour 
scrolling on Facebook.

For those trying to understand the history of home computing, magazines are 
also an important view into what the general outlook was at the time. Amiga 
fans are quite prone to pet peeves (Piracy killed the Amiga! Doom killed 
the Amiga! Ranger! ST ports!) And it can be quite helpful to get an insight 
into what the actual thoughts were at the time. With online access being 
far more limited, magazines often acted as the common social ground for 
users and are often the best way to gauge what reactions were to a 
particular product or development.

Many of the bigger magazines were aimed at a more professional audience 
(Amiga World) or a general user audience (Amiga Format, CU Amiga) and would 
include tutorials and guides on topics from computer graphics to 
programming to using specific applications. These tutorials remain as 
valuable as ever for people looking to use their Amiga in the present day. 
In many cases, tutorials on specific topics can actually be difficult to 
find online and video formats suffer from being slow and inefficient 
compared to a concise written guide.

Game players of course benefit greatly from magazines. Game reviews could 
occasionally baffle and frustrate, but it can be valuable to see what the 
reaction to a game was before the internet forums settled on the one true 
answer. You may be surprised to see that many games considered mediocre 
today were rated quite well, while some fan favourites had frosty 
receptions. Perhaps a useful reminder that when it comes to whether a game 
is fun to actually play, it matters less if it has 4 levels of parallax or 
3.

Gaming-oriented magazines often featured walkthroughs, cheat codes and 
hints as one of their main draws. These can be a lot of fun to try out on 
their own (some have errors or only worked on specific versions of the 
games, and others were straight-up hoaxes) but they are also often not 
documented well online. Sometimes the only answer to solving a particularly 
devious puzzle may lie in an old copy of Amiga Format!
 
A final word of course needs to be said about cover disks. These were disks 
with demos, artwork and sometimes full games or programs that came with the 
magazine. Later they would be replaced with CD options in some cases. Cover 
disks seem to have been more of a feature in the UK magazines and some 
users were able to satisfy all their productivity needs with cover disk 
programs.

Many of these have also been archived online and from a historical 
perspective, it can be a lot of fun to check out a cover disk after reading 
through that particular issue of the magazine. The concrete value is perhaps 
a bit lower these days, as the full version of a particular game is 
generally only a download away.

Of course, you could run an experiment where you rely entirely on cover 
disk games and programs for your Amiga entertainment and productivity needs. 

Hmm, Ill be right back, downloading some cover disks.

    	@{b}Tokyo Retro Computer Users - One Year Later@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

Living in Japan is an amazing experience, and over the 17 years that I have
been here, it has grown to become my home. While there are many great things
about Japan, being an Amiga user is a bit more tricky. The Amiga was a 
presence here and there is hardware available and thanks to the Internet it
is very easy to order all sorts of hardware delivered to Japan. However one
aspect that I miss are the Amiga meetups and shows, in Europe and the States
the Amiga is well catered to. But in Japan not so much, so when the
opportunity presents itself to meet other Amiga users I generally jump at
the chance. One year ago I wrote about my experience at the Tokyo Retro
Computer Users meet up, there I met three other Amiga users and got down
to some serious Amiga discussions. I had always wanted to go back but due
to work or other commitments it was always difficult to make it. But 
finally my schedule lined up with a meet date.

On the 26th of August I woke up to another blistering hot day, my A1200
was packed up in a gym bag ready to travel with me. I took the train
from Inagekaigan station on the Keiyo line to Hatchobori station and
proceeded to the exit on the map I had printed out from Google Maps.
Confident this time that I would not get lost I exited the station and
strolled in the scorching sunshine with my A1200 slung over my back.

After about 20 minutes of walking I was quite lost, not having a smartphone
meant I had to rely on my other GPS. So a quick call to the wife and she
got quickly onto Google Maps finding my position from the surrounding 
buildings and guided me back to the station and then onwards to my
destination. I must say thank you to her for putting up my with Amiga
obsession and lack of direction.

Arriving about one hour late I got the building and quickly changed into a 
clean shirt, paid my entry fee on the 5th floor and then took the lift
down to the 4th floor to meet the rest of the gang. When I entered the
refreshingly cool room there was a small group of people already there
working on their computers. Edoardo came over quickly to say hi and he
also had my A600 board that he had repaired, upon taking removing the
IDE cable four pins came off with it. He had kindly offered to replace the 
IDE connector. Shortly after that I met Sven who recently bought an A1200
and has been slowly building it up. This time he came with his Z80 mini
computer that has evolved from a small motherboard into a fully encased
mini computer with SD card slot and all the necessary IO ports.

This time around I also brought my A1200 in it's translucent case and
new keycaps, I had wanted to see if someone could help me with an issue
with the A314.device driver guruing on me when I did a cold boot. Sven was
able to figure out a solution for this and I am testing the solution at
this moment, if it continues to work I will publish the it in the next 
issue.

Soon other regulars arrived, Michelle brought a very small portable TV and
was working on how to fix an issue of wavy lines appearing on the screen.
Eventually it was traced down to a dodgy power supply, it seems this quite
often the case with older hardware. She also brought along a stack of SNES
games and hearing the sounds from Zelda brought memories rushing back of
my youth. Another memeber Tom had brought an MSX to play games on and had
a remake of Adventure from the Atari 2600.

It was at the point I remembered that I had installed some new games on my
A1200 for *ahem* review purposes and decided it would be nice to get some
game time in, so I managed to rope in Sven and Edoardo for some gaming on
CyberPunks 2 and our exclusive last issue Hamulet. The latter caused the 
most interest when I explained how the game was using HAM mode.

It was a quiet group this time around and while no other Amiga hardware
was on display there was a new person I met who lives only 2 stops away and 
is a big Amiga fan. It was a pleasure meeting you Greg!

The rest of the was spent working on Michelle's SNES, Greg was having some
troubleshooting done on his halfway built IMSAI replica.  Saburo was back
doing an RGB upgrade on his Intellivision replacing the RF out signal. It
was amazing to see him work on such delicate and small board using his
smartphone to figure out what needed to be done.

However all too soon the time came for everyone to pack up, Greg kindly 
offered to drive me back since he is so close to my area. It was fun ride
back packed full of Amiga talk. The next event is slated for the end of 
September and I hope that I can make it. If you wish to join or just find
out more then please visit the meet's website:

@toc talkingamiga
============================================================================
	          @{b}Interview - RNO Developer@{ub}
============================================================================

@{b}1. Thank you for taking part in this interview, you are the author of 
the RNO series of software, can you explain a bit about why you started the 
RNO series of programs?@{ub}

Hi, and thank you for showing interest in my creations :)

I've always been a passionate music consumer, and for the last couple of 
decades I've mainly listened to music on my MorphOS machines when at home. 
I have created many support scripts for audio players with ARexx and with 
Lua too, that's after Lua was integrated as a modern ARexx replacement for 
MorphOS. As a side note, the Lua implementation in MorphOS supports 
existing ARexx ports, etc., which is very useful.

One thing I was missing when listening to music when I was not sat in front 
of my computer, was to have some kind of a front-end screen with larger 
text, so that I could see which song was playing even when I was at the 
other side of a room. I got some inspiration from the music player for the 
PS3 console, and started to wonder if could I produce a similar solution 
with cover image support, etc.. It would also be nice if it would work with 
multiple audio players.

Plain scripting languages weren't quite enough for the plan, or would have 
become too hacky with external requirements, and with C it would have taken 
way too long for me to produce a reliably working program with the features 
I wanted. I started to look at other alternatives and the Hollywood 
programming language seemed to be a promising option for this kind of 
"multimedia" oriented program. It had functions to show images in layers 
with effects, networking support, ARexx support, and so on. It was also 
based on Lua, which I had already learned, so I decided to give it a try.

Hollywood's documentation is incredibly good and it has an active support 
forum, so I got into it quickly. After a while RNOInfoScreen, the first 
application in the "RNO series", was born. Programming with Hollywood was 
really fun and time efficient, so I was able to be productive with it and 
started to fulfill other ideas I had.

@{b}2. What does RNO stand for?@{ub}

RNO is a demogroup that I've been involved with since the late 90s. The 
name comes from 'Rave Network Overscan' originally, but we just use the 
abbreviation nowadays.

It's difficult to come up with program names that wouldn't have been used 
by other programs, and that's why I started adding RNO in front of my 
application names. I guess it's some kind of branding now, but it was just 
for the easi(lazi)ness at first :)

3. The programs are available across a variety of Amiga platforms 
(Classic, MorphOS, OS4.1) what programming language do you use for 
developing the software?

I've been using Hollywood for all my recent multiplatform applications. 
It's a cross-platform multimedia-oriented programming language, that 
originates from the Amiga, and has some Amiga specific features too. It's 
based on the popular Lua scripting language, even though it's pretty much 
hidden within Hollywood's own functions.

You might ask why Hollywood? Well, I'll try to keep it short. Even though I 
know C to some degree, and have even created some Amiga demoscene 
productions with it over the years, I don't feel comfortable enough to make 
well behaved/stable utility programs with it for our platforms. C is a 
low-level language where a single mistake can lead to catastrophes on Amiga 
related platforms where we don't have proper memory protection for legacy 
reasons. You would also need to learn low-level operating system specific 
coding, and generally spend too much time preparing all manner of things 
before getting into actual content production. That said, I still squeezed 
out an RNOInfoScreen screensaver for MorphOS in C, with an embedded LZMA 
packed Hollywood executable in it.

Hollywood, on the other hand, is a high-level language where you can just 
concentrate on producing the actual features for programs and forget the OS 
initialising stuff, etc.. It also doesn't mess or crash the underlying 
operating system or other programs if you create bugs in your code, so it's 
also safer for users in that regard. Finally, as a bonus, a program made in 
Hollywood can work on a dozen of other platforms, that's without any 
adjustments in the code.

The downside of using Hollywood is that it's a bit resource hungry for less 
expanded classic Amigas, but it's really great for Next Generation Amiga 
compatibles and faster classic solutions, or if you want to release any 
programs on mainstream or mobile platforms.

@{b}4. What hurdles have you encountered developing the software?@{ub}

I have written all my recent applications under MorphOS, and development 
itself has been quite painless generally. I've found some Hollywood bugs 
and made some feature requests, but nothing that would have stopped me 
completing the programs before getting fixes or features in Hollywood 
itself. Hollywood's author is very active at fixing bugs and you can be 
sure they're fixed in the next version - if you just report them!

The biggest hurdles I've encountered are with external dependencies on 
other platforms. In theory Hollywood programs should work equally well on 
all platforms if there are enough resources, but in practise that is only 
the case when you're using Hollywood's core functions with its own windows. 
RNOInfoScreen and RNOPDF are good examples of programs that just work on 
every platform without issues, because they're built around Hollywood's 
internal features.

If you use external GUI toolkits (like MUI with a separate plugin for 
Hollywood) or other external programs, there are differences and 
difficulties between platforms. For example, there's 'classic' MUI v3.8, 
but then there are also newer MUI branches, and a clone (Zune) with 
incomplete compatiblity. I've also used external Shell commands from my 
programs, but even some core Shell features differ (like output- 
redirections) and LhA ports are from entirely different branches on some 
platforms, etc.. All this takes time and effort to test and solve, and in a 
worst case scenario you don't find a solution at all, but I'll say more on 
that topic in the next question.

@{b}5. Which platform has been the most difficult, and easiest, to develop 
for?@{ub}

MorphOS has been the easiest to develop for, as it has the latest official 
MUI, based on the work by the original author, and the OS is also very 
compatible with Commodore's AmigaOS. Pretty much everything I've tried to 
do has worked on it virtually straight away, with only a few issues.

There have been some issues with the unofficial MUI branch on OS4, but the 
issues I've faced have now been fixed. OS4 itself dropped some legacy 
support at one point, which was a problem until a work-around was developed 
in Hollywood. Also, a long-standing very annoying crash issue was finally 
traced back to OS4's codesets.library, and now there's a fixed version 
available.

So, in the current situation I can say that both MorphOS and OS4 are the 
easiest and most trouble-free platforms to develop for, from my point of 
view, with the tools I use. Both operating systems also have the required 
libraries built-in, which is way easier than hunting down all those 
dependencies - as on OS3.

So, then as to the harder platforms to develop for ... 68k as a platform is 
so diverse nowadays that it becomes difficult to develop and maintain 
programs on it.

As there are new AmigaOS versions that aren't fully compatible with the 
original OS. For example, the newer versions from Hyperion have created 
several incompatibilities and fundamental changes to Commodore's original 
AmigaOS versions, which has given me some grey hair. At one point I just 
had to make separate executables of my programs to pre- and post AmigaOS 
v3.1.4, prior to me finding work-arounds or otherwise getting fixed.

On the hardware side there are these quasi-software based solutions around 
FPGAs and SBCs, etc., and it seems that their internal software development 
lags behind in most cases, which can be seen as compatiblity issues. For 
example, I've been banging my head against a wall with the unpredictable 
behaviour of FPU versions of my software with Vampire setups. We've been 
tracking it back, all the way, to the C compiler used by Hollywood and 
finally to the FPU implementation in Vampires. At the moment I should just 
say, please don't use the FPU versions of my programs on Vampires - until 
their emulation gets better!

Finally, most 'real' "Classic" Amiga setups have the "legacy" MUI v3.8 
installed, but many emulation setups are using later "Next Generation" MUI 
implementations. If I use newer MUI features in my programs, I have to 
implement checks as to which MUI version is discovered and then have 
specific code with disabled features for older MUI versions.

All in all, it's impossible for me to test my programs on all "68k" 
varieties out there, and I just can't guarantee quality, and user 
experience, with my 68k compiled programs in every situation, which 
annoys me a bit.

AROS (x86) is a whole different beast, and the most difficult to develop 
for from my point of view. None of my programs have worked straight away 
under it, and I always have to make some modifications and work-arounds 
to get them to work as intended, or at least in an acceptable way.

Zune (MUI clone on AROS) doesn't support newer MUI features and even 
legacy MUI v3.8 compatibility isn't complete. I've come across tens of 
features that don't work, or work with glitches, or just crash. I've had to 
change my design, drop some features when running on AROS, just accept some 
glitches, or even forget an AROS version entirely due to Zune.

Certain Hollywood plugins aren't available for AROS, making it impossible 
to complete some of my programs. HTTPS support (internal or external) has 
been non-existent until more recent efforts, but it's still very buggy - 
too much for my uses. Some basic OS features don't work as they exist in 
other Amiga compatibles, for instance, I couldn't find a way to redirect 
'stderr' in Shell. I also had to write a custom solution to run ARexx 
scripts, and so on! You never know what will crop up when trying to run a 
new program under AROS for the first time. All these surprises make AROS 
development more laborious than others.

On top of that, AROS is available in many different varieties. First of all 
I tried to test my programs under Linux hosted versions but they were 
really crashy. Apparently native versions should be more stable, and my 
current setups under VMware feel better. It's still hard to tell if an 
issue is due to AROS itself or the platform/distribution you're running it 
on.

As a final note, I've also released some WarpOS programs, but I have no 
access to 'real' hardware. All I can do is to test them under MorphOS, 
which runs WarpOS binaries, but there seems to be some nuances between the 
real hardware CSPPC and BPPC. So, it's kind of difficult to develop 
"blindly" for WarpOS, but I still think that classic PPC users will 
appreciate that a program can run on a PPC rather than on a 68k. :)

@{b}6. You have created a large variety of software, which one are you most 
proud of?@{ub}

It's difficult to choose, because I'm pretty proud of them all. I'm proud 
of the philosophy behind my programs, which is to make them simple looking 
and simple to use, but still have powerful modern features 'under the hood' 
that you haven't seen with other programs. To concentrate on what you 
really want to achieve with a program and find a fresh approach to its 
implementation. Sometimes people are too stuck with 'traditional' thinking 
and don't see all the coolness in my programs. :D

If I'd have to mention some programs anyway, I'm pretty proud how modular, 
and "effective", RNOEffects is for an image processing program. Each effect 
is in its own include file, and it's just a matter of removing or adding 
only one line in the main source code to enable or disable an effect. When 
enabled, the effect will be listed in a pull-down menu and is available for 
batch conversion, image combining, ARexx controlling, icon exporting, and 
so on. Every effect can be used in all those features, so it's nice that 
you can use all effects in a freely selectable order within it, for 
example, a batch conversion process. Most other programs just offer a 
limited custom selection of processing effects for these special features. 
RNOEffects also offers some nice tricks for alpha transparent graphics, 
which are harder to do on more traditional image processing programs.

RNOWidgets just looks so cool and uses 3D hardware accelerated layers on 
MorphOS and OS4, which is a true Next Generation feature to get realtime 
alpha transparent window backgrounds to make irregular shaped windows, etc..
Widgets are highly configurable in their appearance and you can use semi-
transparent foreground images to create, for example, glossy effects over 
actual widgets, which offers a modern touch with them.

Finally, I can't forget a glowing mention for RNOTags, which is an ultimate 
solution for ID3 tag editing. It can load just about any possible variation 
of tag and it's quite a sophisticated program in its own right, but more 
about that shortly.

@{b}7. Which RNO program was the most difficult to create and why?@{ub}

Even though it's taken time to develop some other programs too, the most 
difficult was, and still is ... RNOTags.

I was longing for a good ID3 tag editor to edit metadata on MP3 files, 
first on the Amiga and then on MorphOS, but years passed and I still wasn't 
pleased with anything I found. Programs either supported ID3v1 tags only or 
had only limited support for ID3v2 frames. They also didn't support 
embedded images, actually broke tags, or were just prone to crashing. I run 
MorphOS with its internal memory tracker enabled, as it's a good way to 
catch buggy programs, and it revealed that the 68k program I used most was 
behaving badly. After finding that I didn't dare to use it often, as it was 
usually: "write a tag with my fingers crossed, and reboot as soon as 
possible if it broke something". How carelessly I had used such programs in 
the old days, and it's no wonder my OS3 setup didn't stay stable for that 
many days without rebooting and the filesystem blew up occasionally. :)

When I had made RNOInfoScreen, which supports loading of embedded cover 
images from MP3 files, I really wanted an editor that could insert a cover 
image into MP3 files that they were missing from. So, I started to take a 
closer look if I could make a better program myself.

OK, what's an ID3 tag then? There are old ID3v1 tags, that are placed at 
the end of a file and have static fields for information, which sounds 
easy. Then there are newer ID3v2 tags, that are at the start of a file and 
are quite ambitiously designed. There's just so much content in the 
specifications, that programmers are likely to take shortcuts without full 
support. Then there are several different revisions of both main versions, 
which aren't even backwards compatible always or have some obscure 
definitions that nobody has ever used. What should I support in my program? 

Well, everything of course!

ID3v2 specifications define over a hundred different kind of "frames", where 
each frame contains a certain piece of information about an audio file. Also 
there can be unofficial frames 'in the wild' to add to that amount, and some 
frames can be used several times in a tag. Many ID3 tag editors support only 
a narrow selection of frames, and then just ditch unsupported frames in the 
worst case. It's not OK to delete a bunch of frames when just editing, for 
example, a song title ... as even the internal tag editing options in 
Windows 10 did this when I last tried, sigh.

I wanted to make sure that all possible frames get preserved, even if my 
program wouldn't know what to do with them, but I also wanted users to be 
able to re-arrange or remove them if desired. It meant I'll have to use a 
dynamic list for frames rather than a fixed set of fields like most other 
programs do. I also wanted to allow users to add and edit any possible text 
based frames, and also some binary frames like attached pictures. It should 
also be possible to convert data between tag versions so that users could 
convert ancient tags to more commonly used ones.

OK, now I know what I want, but is there anything to help me in this 
process? Libraries/plugins I could use? No. Example source codes? Well, one 
for reading specific tag versions, but it seemed to have bugs like 
miscalculating tag sizes, and it doesn't help with writing at all, but it 
gave me some inspiration in how to get started. I decided to write 
everything from scratch myself, and handle files byte-by-byte and tags 
bit-by-bit.

I spent several months reading through and then interpreting the 
specifications over and over again, implementing reading and writing of 
tags, and trying to fill gaps on the information. If googling didn't help, 
then I just scanned through a massive collection of MP3 files to find a 
common pattern to make my own conclusion. For example, there is 
contradicting information if text strings should be null terminated or not 
in v2 tags, so I made an educated guess based on scanning of close to 
thirty thousand files from the 90s to current day, but I still left it user 
selectable in case someone else thought otherwise and wasn't happy with my 
default settings. There have also been other programs that create some 
non-standard mess with tags, or didn't overwrite a previous tag, but added 
new ones - resulting in multiple tags on a file, and all that kind of 
unexpected trash within files that my program would be able to handle and 
ideally be able to dispose of somehow. Even though I don't agree with 
everything in it, this old rant may give you an impression about the 
situation when you want ID3 tag support: 

=> https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-spec-tacular-failure/

After all that ground-work, it was time to write the visible part of the 
program, and that became quite complex too. The GUI is very flexible and 
powerful with all frame adding and arranging options, sniffing 
corresponding frames from filenames, caching, copying, and conversion of 
contents, online help for everything, etc.. With all of this taken into 
account, this has been the *most demanding* program for me to write so far.

@{b}8. What plans do you have beyond the currently available RNO programs?@{ub}

Updating current programs seems to be an eternal project, and some of the 
programs should be released on more platforms, but that would need more 
testing. For example, RNOTags isn't widely available, as I planned to 
release it on a certain app store to get some compensation for all the 
effort I put into it, but the plan dried up and the program was left in 
limbo. It's only available for MorphOS as donationware now, but I'm going 
to release it for other platforms myself, in due time. It will take some 
time though, as I started to add a FLAC support for it, which is still far 
from being ready.

Though there are always ideas for totally new software, and the AROS camp 
is eager to fulfill some software gaps, so I get many requests and support 
from there (hi Salvatore!). RNOPublisher, RNOArchive, and RNOTunes were 
born in this way, and there's at least one new program I've promised to 
make.

I have some wild ideas for new apps and it would be interesting to try if 
they'd be do-able, but they might be just too ambitious to start with. I'd 
also want to make a couple of games one day, I already have ideas if I'd 
ever have time from application coding. Also, demoscene compos always 
inspire me to do something myself too, but I don't know if that will 
happen. I don't have any roadmaps or exact plans, it just happens if I get 
a do-able idea or some program needs an update quicker than others, but 
generally I have several programs under development simultaneously and 
they finish when they finish.

@{b}9. Thank you for your contributions to the Amiga scene, do you have any 
final words before we finish the interview?@{ub}

Please give feedback to developers, be it on public forums or email, but 
it's always nice to hear if someone has tried or even uses your programs. 
Even a short comment gives developers a good feeling, and if you've ever 
wanted to code yourself, give it a try as you've no excuses! It's still 
fun despite some challenges :)

Also, thank you for all the people who have supported my software 
development! Thanks to Neil Pearson for being a tireless proof-reader for 
my ReadMes, MorphOS Library articles, and now for this interview too.

@node erikhogan "Erik Hogan Interview"
@toc talkingamiga
============================================================================
	       @{b}Interview - Erik Hogan (Scorpion)@{ub} by @{"Rob O'Malley" link robomalley}
============================================================================

@{i}Scorpion Engine is a game development system for the Amiga and Mega 
Drive Genesis conceived of and developed by Erik Hogan. It is designed to 
be easy to use and flexible, while still providing the performance and 
features needed to create high-quality games. Scorpion Engine is free to 
use, and it is supported by a growing community of developers.@{ui}

@{b}1. Can you share your history with Amiga computers and Megadrive 
consoles? How old were you when you first encountered them, and what are 
some standout memories or experiences you had with these platforms? How did 
your usage of Amiga computers and Megadrive consoles contribute to your 
passion for game development and coding?@{ub}

The Amiga was something I never had as a kid - I grew up on the C64 and it 
seemed like the Amiga was the obvious eventual upgrade path. To that end I 
collected issues of Amiga Power, hoping to have a substantial coverdisk 
games library by the time I finally got my hands on one.

The Amiga upgrade never came - Doom was on the horizon and the general 
consensus at the time was that PC was taking over the computer market. But 
I never forgot how badly I wanted one, and around a decade ago I got my 
CD32. The desire to do something creative with it led me into the homebrew 
projects that eventually became Scorpion Engine.

I don't have that many memories of the Mega Drive specifically, nearly 
everyone I knew was a Master System owner. But there was one standout - I 
remember seeing a demo of Road Avenger in an electronics store, and I was 
blown away by the gorgeous anime visuals (in spite of the lack of gameplay). 
That experience inspired me to do an unofficial Amiga port decades later.

@{b}2. Can you elaborate on the key features and functionalities of your 
game development system that differentiate it from other existing solutions 
for the Amiga and Megadrive and how do you envision your game development 
system addressing the needs and challenges specific to these retro 
platforms?@{ub}

There are three key pillars for Scorpion Engine:

  1. Performance - Scorpion is aimed at making highly performant games on 
     unexpanded Amigas and Mega Drives. While this is a tricky challenge 
     for a generic engine running on vintage hardware, every update brings 
     improved speed through gradual conversion of the underlying codebase 
     to optimised ASM.

  2. Flexibility - Scorpion is designed to be flexible enough to tackle a 
     wide variety of genres. There are projects in Scorpion that represent 
     the platformer, shooter, action-rpg and beat-em-up genres.

  3. Simplicity - Scorpion is meant to be usable for anyone who wants to 
     use it. It uses modern file formats like PNG for graphics and Tiled 
     for map editing, and the codeblocks scripting system is designed to be 
     easy to use without needing to learn programming.

With these three key pillars, it very much is intended to be a 68K 
counterpart to engines like Unity, Unreal, GameMaker and Construct.

There are other game creation engines for Amiga such as Backbone and 
Redpill, both of which are viable options for making a quality Amiga game. 
And there are also game creation engines for other platforms such as 
GBStudio and NesMaker. But for the Mega Drive, the only alternatives to 
Scorpion that I'm aware of require the learning of programming languages.

@{b}3. What advice would you give to someone who is interested in using 
Scorpion Engine to create their own games? What are the best resources for 
learning how to use Scorpion Engine?@{ub}

Unfortunately there's not a lot in the way of good documentation or "from 
scratch" tutorials out there for Scorpion. There's so much to be done on 
the engine and so little time that I have to prioritise rapid progress over 
everything else.

For new users, I'd always recommend just downloading it and tinkering with 
the large number of demos that are included.

There's also a long running thread at EAB that is a common place to ask for 
advice at: 

=> https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=97450 

as well as a growing Discord community on the PixelGlass server at: 

=> https://discord.gg/VpWBCd8TGg. 

The Scorpion community is always friendly and happy to help out newcomers.

@{b}4. What are the plans for future development of Scorpion Engine?@{ub}

The future plan is to continue growing in terms of features, performance 
and platform support. The Amiga will continue to receive specific features 
just for that platform as well as general features that improve all 
platforms. Porting code from Blitz to pure 68k asm to improve speed and 
reduce the size of the engine is an ongoing process.

I've also recently been dwelling on writing a Rust runtime to allow 
Scorpion games to be ported to Windows, Mac, Linux, Web, Android and iOS. 
In addition, support for Neo Geo is tentatively planned in 2024, and Jaguar 
in 2025.

@{b}5. What are some notable projects that have been developed using 
Scorpion Engine, and which projects do you believe best showcase the 
features of the engine? Additionally, what projects would you like to see 
developed using Scorpion Engine in the future?@{ub}

There's so many out there, I feel like I'm going to miss out on some really 
important ones! I do need to apologise for major projects I haven't listed 
below.

I think Mixel's "Creeping Me Out: Hex Night" is by far the largest and most 
ambitious Scorpion project that's ever worked on, there's so much depth and 
variety in it that it's an excellent showcase for what can be done with the 
engine.

Wonderboy by AcidBottle and Green Beret by Dante Mendes also show that the 
engine is capable of handling full length arcade ports. Also, Dante's 
upcoming Castlevania AGA is a good example for how visually stunning Amiga 
games can be.

There's also a handful of games like Boxx 4 (Lemming880) Duckstroma 
(UltraNarwhal) where they're very conscientious about performance, those 
games are excellent examples that show that the engine can run well on 
stock hardware when designed specifically for it.

Aeon's Legend (formerly known as 'Scorpion Boy') is a game that I've helped 
BitBeamCannon on that aims to be the best of both worlds, combining world 
class visuals with decent performance on stock hardware.

So far as games I want to see developed in the future, the number #1 is 
definitely AlarCity - my own, well overdue, running-and-gunning action RPG. 
Finding the time to work on it alongside all other Scorpion projects and the 
engine itself is a challenge, but it's always in the back of my mind and 
every now and again I dust it off and do a little more on it.

Finally, I've always craved a Shantae game or port in Scorpion Engine - if 
Wayforward ever offered me chance to work on a Shantae project, I'd say 
yes in a heartbeat.

@{i}Thanks Erik for taking the time to answer these questions, the engine 
itself is open source and found on GitHub:@{ui}

	  @{b}Interview - Gunnar von Boehn (Apollo Team)@{ub}
============================================================================
@{b}1. Hello, can you introduce yourself and explain how you came to Amiga and 
   what you do in the Apollo team?@{ub}

My name is Gunnar von Boehn aka 'BigGun'. I was born in 1972 in Braunschweig
Germany. Maybe the city name sounds familiar to you, as Commodore had its 
big European factory in my home city Braunschweig. So, it's no wonder that 
I had C-64 computer myself at a young age. I was lucky that my best friend's 
older brother was very active in the C64-unprotection crew "LCS", which gave 
me plenty of games and my friend and me also learned a bit of coding.

Inspired by the great C64 games we also tried to code games. With my very 
limited skills at that time, I spend a lot time working on a small C64 Indi 
vertical shooter game of a flying dragon named "King of the Air".

Commodore released the Amiga 1000 in 1986 in Germany. The Amiga was totally 
innovative. It was showcased in several local computer stores. The powers of 
Amiga were absolutely impressive. Games like Defender of the Crown blew me 
away. The combination of graphical and musical powers clearly showed how 
advanced the Amiga is. As I did not have the money to buy an A1000 right 
away - I spent most days after school in the computer store trying to get 
my hands on it to play with one of the showcases A1000. Staying each day in 
the computer store I met one day a guy from a very early Amiga cracker group 
"PowerStation" and we became friends.

With a stroke of luck, my parents won a little sum of money, which they 
invested to buy me an A1000 in 1987. I was totally happy - and immediately 
joined the Amiga cracker team "PowerStation" later "Traxxion" later 
"Sinners". Being in this group gave me access to an unlimited number of 
games but most importantly, it gave me access to all the assembly codes of 
their intros and cracktros. I got some good books. the excellent Amiga 
hardware reference manuals, and a 68K CPU instruction book. From then on, 
I was totally focused on learning how the great machine Amiga works. The 
working example codes of the intros helped me a lot to quickly understand 
both the 68k and the powers of the Amiga chipset.

It was clear to me that the Amiga is an engineering masterpiece.

The 68000 CPU is not only very powerful but also very coder-friendly and 
very nice to code on. The Amiga combines the CPU with the very powerful and 
smart Amiga chipset. The idea behind the chipset to have DMA-based 
independent working helpers Sprites/Copper/Blitter etc is genius. 

Some people say school took a back seat, from then on for me.

I would say I spend a lot of time coding intros, demos, and trainers. While 
technically still at school, I had a part-time job at a local video company 
where I programmed video effects for them on the Amiga in assembly. I had 
at that time still my A1000 and later an A2000 with a 68020 CPU accelerator 
card and hard drive. I started dreaming of making a living as an Amiga game 
developer and started coding some games in assembly. "Ravage" was a typical 
Arcade shooter, "Wega Wars" was a Space Explore/Conquer simulation.

After I finished school, I did my military service and then spent my money 
on getting the brand new Amiga 4000 and coded a lot on it. The last major 
project I did on the A4000 was coding a relational database for the Amiga. 

Then catching me by surprise, Commodore went broke.

This broke my heart. :( My plans on making a living as an Amiga game 
developer were blown away. I knew how advanced the Amiga was and how much 
better its internal design was compared to the PC. So wanted to work with 
computers - it was not so easy for me to have to work with the technically 
inferior and to me "disgusting" PC designs.

I worked for a number of computer industry companies. After showing the 
database that I wrote on Amiga I got a job at MySQL. I also worked at SONY 
and later in hardware development at IBM and much later in CPU development 
at HUAWEI.

All the jobs that I got... I got because of the great amount of programming 
and hardware knowledge I had acquired working with the Amiga. It was at IBM 
where I met many other Amigans. We were at this time working together in 
the "CELL" team (heart of PlayStation 3). "CELL" was a joint development of 
SONY and IBM. We quickly became good friends who shared a love for the 
Amiga and talked a lot at lunchtime about how superior many concepts of 
Amiga were and still are. We assumed how wonderful the Amiga is to learn 
programming and learn how hardware works and how elegant the Amiga design 
is. We quickly agreed it was a shame that Amiga did not continue.

We then formed the idea - that Amiga was so great - that it's worth 
reviving and continuing it. Based on this we started the NatAmi (Native 
Amiga) project and our goal was to revive Amiga again. For the Natami we 
needed a CPU, which of course needed to be a 68K CPU. As only the 68K has 
the coder-friendly features which made Amiga such a great computer. As 
Motorola did not produce any 68K anymore. We decided to make our own much 
more advanced 68K CPU.

Which we named "APOLLO" - so this is where the Apollo Project started.

Today I am the team lead of the Apollo-Team and I am the manufacturer of 
the great V4 cards here in Germany.  I spend my day working on computer 
development, core updates, answering user questions or making great 
Amiga-world-domination plans with our team. I enjoy very much working 
together, with a great team of "crazy" computer nerds, who have the same 
dream of giving the 68K the well-deserved status back, so somehow when 
Commodore went bankrupt my quest to revive the Amiga began :)

@{b}2. Can you tell us what the Amiga means to you?@{ub}

The current Amiga landscape is very diverse. A cursory glance at the Amiga 
computing scene through internet searches will reveal a diverse number of 
solutions that aim to revitalise Amiga-experience. Options range from 
preservation-only based 'replica' printed circuit boards to PC's running 
software to emulate of the Amiga. In addition, there are also a lot of 
people to whom the look, shape or feel of the huge, cream housing with 
the rainbow checkmark, seems to be very important.

For the Apollo Team, and of course, especially for me, it is clear that it 
is about the inner values that make an Amiga an Amiga.

	1. The efficient Amiga chipset
	2. The powerful 68K CPU
	3. The freedom of the Amiga OS

The Amiga combined excellent GFX and audio capabilities, with an OS which 
was swift, logical, understandable, straightforward 'and simple' and most 
importantly it left the programmer's freedom and didn't restrict them. 

Combined with a CPU which was designed to make programming understandable 
and made the 'homemade' software development possible for everyone. And all 
this for an affordable price.

Such beauty isn't typically seen in other places today. You will not find 
it on Linux or Windows machines. Even today's 4 GHz PCs do often not have 
the swiftness, they are hard to understand and are absolutely not 
straightforward, they give the users less freedom, and are bloated and 
inefficient, totally the opposite of the beloved Amiga design. It is clear 
that today's Computers are complex to understand and do not make the best 
out of the performance they could have.

That is why the Apollo Team decided to revive this timeless beauty of the 
Amiga architecture. So, the idea of the Apollo-Team is to combine the 
elegance of the Amiga design with modern possibilities and to develop and 
improve an Amiga, in the spirit of the good old times.
 
The vision of the team is not about the marketing, branding, logos or case 
design and of course, it is not about emulation or other ugly workarounds 
to make machines pretend to be an Amiga. 

The Apollo Team's vision is to keep the fundamental inner values above 
alive and regard these as technical beauty and design marvels, which were 
created by brilliant engineers. Dave Haynie, former chief engineer for 
Commodore, once said "The Apollo Team, CPU and chipset innovations are 
truly in the same innovation spirit of the original Amiga inventors. Making 
the Vampire an Amiga, which the original team would have designed too." 

@{b}3. Can you talk about how the history of the NatAmi project started in 
2002?@{ub}

It was in the year 2002 when a group of IBM developers, comprising Thomas 
Hirsch, Jens Kuenzer, Christoph Hoehne, Peter Kaltstein and myself started 
the 'Native Amiga' or NATAMI project. All these enthusiastic computer 
professionals were working for IBM at Cell-CPU-solutions like for example 
'ROADRUNNER' which was at that time the world's fastest super-computer.

We 'Amigans' found each other very quickly during the coffee breaks. We 
spoke about how much better, more elegant and easier the work at IBM would 
have been with the Amiga and how much easier coding for 68K was than for 
IBM's PowerPC and how regrettable it was that Commodore didn't exist 
anymore. 

In the beginning more for fun, but at some point, with a certain crazy 
seriousness, we raved about how nice it would be to revive the Amiga. At 
one of these conversations, it was Thomas Hirsch who said, that he had 
already started redesigning the Amiga-AGA - Chipset and that it was more 
or less working, 'THAT' was the starting signal to rewrite history.

The goal of the NATAMI Team was to reimplement the Amiga architecture 
according to the original clever Amiga spirit. The team had the problem of 
not having access to chip fabrication to build any Amiga chips. So we used 
a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology for building the Chipset. 
FPGAs are 'writeable' chips just like a writeable CD-ROM. And just like a 
writeable CD-ROM, it can be used to put your own music onto it. A designer 
can put inside a writeable FPGA his own logic, thereby creating his own 
chips. Using writeable chips is not a new concept. Commodore did this 
already many times and in many Amigas or cards for Amiga often writeable 
chips were used. The 68040 CPU card of the A4000 for example, has ten 
writeable chips on it.

So the team of Amiga-loving colleagues at IBM decided to revive the Amiga. 
After we recreated the AGA chipset and finished Thomas's work, the next two 
steps needed, were to source many 68060 CPUs from Motorola and to build the 
NATAMI main board.

The goal was to create thousands of boards to help to grow the Amiga user 
base and create again a market for new Amiga development.

The reinvented AGA chipset did impress every Amiga fan seeing it. When Bill 
Buck the CEO of Genesi saw it, he proposed to add this AGA chipset to the 
3rd generation of his Pegasos systems. He wishes to create a compatible 
system that could run real Amiga software directly in hardware. But as it 
turned out, this future Pegasos version never came to fruition, so the deal 
never came about.

The Pegasos Systems used a PowerPC CPU from Motorola chip branch Freescale.

The PowerPC chip was originally invented by IBM. As the NATAMI Team members 
were all working at IBM's PowerPC laboratory they were PowerPC experts and 
were programming PowerPC every day. They knew that this chip did not meet 
the requirements they wanted to revive the Amiga. The PowerPC is a fast CPU 
and it is very strong in floating point performance, but it is not 
programmer-friendly at all. And because, in the opinion of the NATAMI- Team 
the programmer friendliness was one of the main aspects of Amiga, the lack 
of good programmability was the show stopper for using PowerPC chips.

We knew that we needed new 68K CPUs to revive the Amiga. The programmer 
friendliness of the 68K CPU was what made coding for Amiga so great. Also, 
we wanted at least the 68060 CPU. If we want to revive Amiga, it should not 
be slower than the Amiga used to be. But getting thousands of 68060s was an 
impossible problem to solve.

Motorola stopped long ago to produce these chips, and you cannot buy them 
anymore. So, we hoped to convince Motorola to produce them again. Thomas 
and I arranged a meeting with Freescale, who is the chip production part of 
Motorola, in Austin Texas in 2008 using the help of Bill Buck, CEO of 
Genesi. Bill Buck had excellent connections to Motorola and arranged the 
meeting for us. The Freescale guys were very friendly and receptive to the 
NATAMI. At the same time, the Freescale vice president made it crystal 
clear that they could not produce the 68060 anymore. 'Sorry Guys, the tools 
are gone, the plans are gone, even the fab does not exist anymore. This 
means we would need to redevelop the 68060 from scratch - but the original 
team of developers is not with Motorola anymore, many are in retirement 
homes now!', he said.

So it was impossible to restart production with their current budget. But it 
was not about money, "Even if you put a million dollars on the table. There 
is no chance for new 68060 processors" Freescale's vice president told 
Thomas and me. 

Despite this impasse, Freescale offered something else. The Coldfire CPU 
family. The Coldfire was interesting to evaluate because the Coldfire is 
some kind of relative to the 68K CPU. The goal of the Coldfire family was 
to use the same good and very human readable 68K instruction set, but at 
the same time to simplify the CPU by leaving a number of instructions out. 
This made the chip both simpler and cheaper to produce than the 68K.
 
But it would have the disadvantage that the missing instruction would trap 
out and need to be emulated by a software library. This concept was not 
new, the original Motorola 68060 CPU, which was used for the Phase5 
Cyberstorm accelerators, already missed some instructions of the 68K 
family. And the missing instructions needed to be emulated in software. 
Emulating in software is of course much slower than execution in hardware. 
And while software libraries for missing instructions could be used from 
Workbench this was not possible when an Amiga game was directly booted. 
This was part of the reason why some games crashed on 68060. The 
performance hit for the missing instructions on the 68060 was manageable as 
only a few needed to be emulated and the majority was executed in hardware.
For the Coldfire the situation was different as it missed a lot more 
instructions, so it was not clear how useful it could be in an Amiga.
 
Back home I was benchmarking the Coldfire and profiled the Amiga OS to see 
how many instructions of the instructions that the Coldfire lacks were used 
by the Amiga OS. The tests clearly showed, that the Coldfire chip was 
relatively weak in-memory performance and the Amiga OS used far too many 
instructions the Coldfire missed. The combination of poor memory performance 
and slowdown by missing too many instructions would result in Amiga OS and 
old Amiga applications only running slowly on it. So, in the end, it was 
obvious that for the NATAMI project, the Coldfire was not suitable.

The Team had to find another solution to bring NATAMI to life. After the 
first shock, Jens and me brainstormed about developing our very own CPU, 
again with an FPGA. 

If you know that IBM or Intel needs about 500-1000 people working 2 years 
on a chip design, this idea was more than crazy. IBM calculates for this 
high amount of man-working- hours typically a development budget of about 
40 million USD for a new chip design.

@{b}4. What was the main idea behind the Vampire/Firebird/Icedrake Acclerators?@{ub}

Many Amiga owners are faithful to their beloved Amiga and continue to use 
them all the years. We have developed the best 68K CPU of the world! Our 
Apollo 68080 not only continues the excellent programmability of all 68K 
it also adds new features to it and reaches a performance no other 68K was 
able to reach before.

Dave Haynie - former Chief Engineer at Commodore International acknowledged 
this and said on Facebook about the V4 technology: "If Commodore had the 
68080 CPU then, Amiga would have ruled the world." 

We believe that our Amiga fans should be supported to use their Amigas as 
long and as well as possible. Therefore we have created accelerator cards 
for them giving them the best 68K CPU and also allowing them to upgrade 
their Amiga chipset to Super-AGA. 

Our accelerators allow owners of Amiga 500/1000/2000/600 and 1200 to upgrade 
their system to the fastest CPU and to Super-AGA, allowing them to play AGA 
games.

Yes, you can finally play AGA games also on your Amiga 500!

All the Amiga owners can use Truecolor, 3D acceleration and 16bit Audio 
features of the newest and best Amiga chipset.

These accelerators create a basis with the same performance and operties 
as our new Standalone V4 Amiga has. Having the same features makes it easy 
for software programmers to develop new powerful games again, which will 
ensure the survival of the Amiga over time.

@{b}5. Can you provide an overview of the Super AGA chipset?@{ub}

I assume everyone knows the great original three custom chips of the Amiga?

The chief engineers in former times named the important audio chip Paula, 
the graphic chip Denise and the management chip Agnus.. The design of DMA 
channels, the power of audio voices, the possibilities that sprites and 
bitplanes offer, the concept of the Blitter is clever and enable the 
programmer to do very cool stuff. Probably the most important and most 
clever is the Copper that has the power to orchestrate it all. This design 
is clever and very elegant, it's creative, and it's even revolutionary 
today! It's a design for the future.
 
Furthermore, the Amiga chipset is very well explained with good 
documentation, and once you understand how it works you can do amazing 
things with it. In my opinion, the Amiga chipset is an amazing masterpiece 
of its own. Understanding the chipset itself means realising that this is 
the work of geniuses!

The chipset is fully DMA based. This means it can play audio, show GFX, 
show sprites (These are small moving GFX elements) or can copy parts of 
the screen just by using the Blitter, without any demand on the CPU. The 
copper, which is a special unit, does help to coordinate all this. This 
DMA-based concept was well ahead of its time. 

Of course, when the Amiga chipset was developed some compromises had to be 
made to save cost. And the original Amiga chip designers planned to add 
many features in future chipsets. It was planned to add modes with more 
colours. In addition there were plans to add Chunky Modes, these modes 
provide some advantage for certain types of games. It was also planned to 
add support for higher quality audio samples like 16-bit audio, more audio 
channels to make sound richer in games. The Blitter 'A the chip which 
copies a lot of Gfx in games. It operates in the original Amiga on 16bit 
and it was planned to upgrade this to 64bit. There were also plams to 
upgrade the Copper and it even to build 3D acceleration into the Amiga 
chipset.

And SUPER-AGA does all this which was ever planned and dreamed of for the 
Amiga. It adds all the features that the Amiga developer has ever dreamed 
of having.

Super-AGA is the Amiga chipset that Commodore might have built if Amiga 
ruled the world today.

@{b}6. What were some of the key features and specifications of the Super AGA 
chipset that set them apart from the first-generation Amigas?@{ub}

The AGA chipset is a great design. The idea to have DMA channels which do 
all the work and offload the CPU is very smart and opens up great 
opportunities, without needing to waste CPU time. The Amiga chipset 
combines many features which increase the efficiency of the system a lot. 
While the Apollo Team admires this ingenious invention, it has to be 
honestly said that there are also limitations in the good old AGA. For 
example, the concept of the Amiga audio channels was great, but the OCS 
audio channels were limited to a 28 kHz maximum sample rate, which was 
excellent at their time but a little below the CD quality of 44khz today. 
The upgrade from OCS to ECS improved this and increased the supported 
sample rate of 56Khz, exceeding even CD quality. The Amiga had 4 DMA-based 
audio channels. Four-channel allows the creation of excellent Amiga MODULE 
music or excellent sound effects for games, but when you want to have both 
at the same time, 4 channels become a limitation.

Having 8 or 16 HW channels would make coding games with both awesome music 
and perfect sound effects a lot easier.

The original Amiga designers were aware of these limitations, and they 
planned to upgrade the AMIGA chipset with 'AAA' to improve audio by having 
more Amiga DMA audio channels and to improve graphics to 24-bit. So, it was 
planned not to replace but to improve the Amiga chipset. With this 
knowledge, it is clear that a Team with so many clever minds such as the 
Apollo-Team, has completely in the spirit of the developers at that time, 
further developed the AGA chipset. In this sense, the Super AGA chipset is 
the next step of the Amiga design.

In short, the Super-AGA chipset is the next generation Amiga chipset which 
the Commodore always planned to develop but never brought to market. But 
the most important thing is, that the SAGA chipset follows all the good 
and efficient Amiga ideas, and even with all the new great features it is 
100% coded as a true Amiga chipset. You would never get such a swift 
elegant and beloved Amiga feeling with using a PC graphic card plugged 
into an Amiga or doing other ugly NON AMIGA workarounds.

As I say, "Since Super-AGA, coding games for Amiga never has never been
so easy and fun!"

============================================================================
I'm sure you're all enjoying the wonderful WhatIFF magazine as much as I 
am, my sincere apologies for not contributing to the last issue, a family 
health matter - my dear Wife had been extremely sick with a very rare 
disease, and a long recovery journey ahead, anyway back on to these fun 
Amiga projects.

Here are a few updates.

@{b}Amiga Art Contest 2023@{ub}

The Amiga Art Contest for 2023 is officially open, Doug/10Marc recently 
posted his official video announcing the start of this very exciting 
competition.  We have the same categories which are Hand Drawn, 
Photographs, 3D/Ray Traced, Animations, Music/MODS, Deadline is 11th 
November 2023. Please remember you can use Real or Emulated Amigas and 
Doug/myself are the two judges, Anyone who is a patreon of either of us can 
also vote for best in each category. We plan to have a few prizes, for the 
moment keeping some of them secret. As long as you have created the 
Art/Music using Amiga software your entry is valid. What we do also love is 
the description, process and inspiration story behind your creative efforts. 

Best of luck :)

@{b}Boss Machine@{ub}

Boss Machine I have been focusing on a lot more Big Bosses with detailed 
animation frames and ideas for how each of them move. I have posted lots of 
free content on my Patreon and various social sites, e.g. EAB forum :) 
Recently we did a test for some of those fast parallax scrollers to add more 
detail in the background, we can swap out some of the parallax splits with 
other unique graphic tiles. Another focus for me is the end level design. 
Technically the pixel height we have for some levels is 480 pixels and we 
have a few tricks up our sleeve to enhance end level areas such as adding 
caves to fly into, modifying colour palettes for the foreground/enemies that 
help blend into the background, I plan to post some of these ideas on my 
Patreon very soon.  Dan and I need to test this out first so expect a quick 
video or two :) 

In general Boss Machine is getting a lot more attention.

@{b}Apollo Invaders@{ub}

Space Invaders for all Apollo Vampires is constantly improving and right now 
we are focusing on adding more mid bosses (ten) as well as a reward system 
for every zone you complete. The game has 100 levels and everytime you 
complete a zone you get a medal for your achievements. Alongside these Mid 
level Bosses will have tiny children enemies that are simplified versions 
of the mothership. 

We plan to showcase this new update at Gamescon :) 

We do also plan to release a boxed version of the game, so this is also 
exciting news for anyone who loves to collect physical media. Sneak peek of 
these enemy designs on my Patreon blog :) 

Till next time,

Amiga Forever

@toc contents
============================================================================
          	 @{b}September 2023 Cover Disk Contents@{ub} 
============================================================================

Welcome to our 3rd cover disk or rather 3rd contents folder, for this issue
we have playable demo of the in development BitBeam Cannon game 
Aeons Legend, here are few words from the developer about the demo:

@{i}Aeon Legends is currently being developed by the BitBeamCannon team using 
scorpion engine. Please be aware the game is still in early development WIP
and that the game is designed for at least 2 button controllers. 1 button 
is jump, one attack, hold up and attack to throw the projectile weapon, and 
top left shoulder button on CD32 (or space-bar) to switch the weapon you 
will throw between a boomerang or a bomb also, the little statues with e 
up-arrows are like guidesigns.. if you walk onto them and tap up text will 
appear with clues for the things you can do in the game.

This is not a real level designed to be fun, it's a demo level to show the 
progress and game features.@{ui}

In addition we have multi-module for your listening pleasure, and here are
words from one of the artists involved:

@{i}Acidic breakcore OctaMED multi-module by Mr. Roboto, df0:BAD & cTrix in 
2023. Over twenty minutes of music in about 1.2 uncompressed megabytes of 
data. For best results please use the latest version of Hippo Player if not 
OctaMED itself. Look out for the upcoming physical floppy music disk 
release in late november!@{ui}

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}

  My journey with the Amiga started in either '87/'88 when the family got an
  A500 (Back then it was a computer for the whole family), I remember the 
  monitor and A500 boxes almost being as high as myself. Before this time I
  had only been exposed to the ZX Spectrum and C64, using the blue Workbench
  for the first time was an amazing experience. When I saw DigiPaint in
  action I could not believe my eyes. From that moment I was a devoted Amiga
  user going through various Amigas, A500+A570, A600, A3000 and A1200. Over
  the years my Amiga has been used to creating digital artwork and for 
  making or shall I say trying to make music. Then in the year 2021 I decided
  for some crazy reason that the Amiga scene needed a digital magazine 
  similar to Amiga Report. It was my intention to have something that picked
  up where the great Amiga magazines such as Amiga World and Amazing 
  Computing left off, providing a more serious look at Amiga usage through
  tutorials and reviews.

  ISS from either. If people say the Amiga couldn't do it, he's probably 
  looking for a way to do it. Steve writes his WhatIFF articles mostly

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}

  Like many Amiga users my first computer addiction was the mighty 
  Commodore 64! One day close to Christmas of 1986 I drove to my local 
  Commodore store called Comspec...I was in high school and played rep 
  hockey at the time and didn't have the time I used to when I was in grade 
  school to visit Comspec each weekend to check out the latest magazine and 
  games. Imagine my surprise when I stepped into the store and immediately in 
  front of me was THE AMIGA! It was looping the Defender of The Crown intro 
  and I fell in love instantly! From that day on it was my mission to buy 
  that Amiga but I had just worked a few part time jobs to help pay for my 
  first ever used car and didn't have a hundred bucks to my name lol. The 
  Amiga was close to $2,000 Canadian dollars (after taxes) and unlike my
  C64 my parents didn't fall for the 'I need it for school' rant again.

  To (try) to make a very long story short I didn't save up to buy my Amiga 
  until I started University in 1989. In the mean time I saw another Amiga 
  called the Amiga 500 at Comspec and it was a lot cheaper than THE AMIGA 
  but my eyes and heart and soul were only set on THE AMIGA! When I finally 
  bought it that was the proudest/happiest moment I've ever felt and I 
  jumped straight into University with Excellence! word processor and 
  Logistix spreadsheet/ database. In my 2nd year I bought my first ever 
  hard drive, a whopping 33MB which had its own case which sat atop my 
  Amiga 1000 case. Later fast ram side cars showed up and I mingled with 
  Manx Aztec C compiler in computer science class. Of course all the great 
  games with awesome music/sound effects made my Apple/PC friends envious!

  By my 3rd year we had a small Amiga computer club and a few of us got our 
  first accelerator boards for our Amiga which was called LUCAS and was 
  based on a design in a Transactor magazine. It had a 68020 at 16 MHz with 
  FPU on it and it really helped out with the more complicated spreadsheets 
  and compiling programs. Life was good, the internet was just starting up, 
  I graduated University and got my first full time job and then the bad 
  news of Commodore going bankrupt hit the newspapers, magazines, and BBS 
  boards! There was so much activity going on still in user groups and 
  computer stores so us Amiga users just figured that it would sort itself 
  out. At work  there were only PC's running AutoCAD and I despised using 
  the early Windows systems and couldn't wait to get back home to my Amiga. 
  Over the years busy with work and 'adult life' many of my Amiga friends 
  moved on to PCs and I ended up getting my first Amiga 1200 and later 
  Amiga 4000 for great prices. I was still amazed how the Amiga community 
  was still active and so helpful up to the early 2000's. By then I was 
  married and working harder than ever to save up to buy a home instead of 
  renting an apartment and my Amiga's were left at my parents house until 
  around 2010 or so I read about a brand new Amiga which was coming out 
  based on PPC CPU called the AmigaONE X1000 running a new AmigaOS4. I was 
  skeptical at first after hearing about the technical issues with the 
  earlier SE, XE boards with the initisal AmigaOS4 release but after 
  consulting with some friends I joined the beta test team to get one of 
  the first X1000 boards and I immediately felt at home with AmigaOS4.1 
  and have used it as my home Amiga ever since. Once I got some space set 
  up in my house I got my Amiga's out of my parents house finally and 
  eventually my original Amiga 1000 sits next to my AmigaONE X1000 and 
  original C64 and of course my Amiga 1200 and 4000 came along too and with 
  new accelerator cards and ram boards and spare motherboards and parts 
  etc etc etc. Here I am today grateful to the Amiga computer and 
  especially to the amazing Amiga community who back then and today has 
  always been resilient, creative and helpful !

  My journey with the Amiga started around 1988, The first time seeing the 
  Amiga 1000 in the shop window playing animations such as the @{b}Amiga Juggler@{ub}
  I fondly remember. My Brother and I saved up for an A500, and eventually 
  bought an A4000 (cybervision 64 card) and then an A1200 with an 030 
  accelerator. I loved collecting every Amiga Magazine with demo disks. My 
  interest in game designing for the Amiga started with deluxe paint and 
  I did dabble with @{b}The Miracle Keyboard@{ub} but that skill in music 
  didn't last. It is because of the Amiga that I now work in video 
  animation and game design.

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}

  Danish Amiga fan since the 90s. Started with a 1200 and a 1200 is my 
  machine today. I am interested in the casual and the philosophical 
  aspects of the Amiga computer. 

  My cats enjoy Turrican.

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}

  Rob has been making music on Amiga ever since in the mid to late 90's 
  his guitar teacher suggested that he get a drum machine to practice along 
  to, and he instead opted to use OctaMED on his Amiga 500+ with A590 to 
  craft beats and basslines

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}
  Manical started making music for the Amiga in early 2021 (April) and has 
  released at some demoparties, and is planning to go to more along the 
  way. He's in the demogroups MoonShine and Hokuto Force as a musician, and 
  soon to be a coder or graphician. He started out with Protracker for his 
  first 3 mods, then moved to FastTracker primarily, and then he started 
  exploring Impulse Tracker and started making tracks with Furnace. His 
  songs have gotten good reviews by many famous people in the demoscene, 
  such as Jammer, Purple Motion, Skaven, and cTrix (Most known for his 
  gAtari). Since his music journey, he's entered Syntax 2021, Mysdata 2022, 
  Boozedrome VI (Which his track that he entered ended up on the official 
  Boozedrome tape which was limited to 50 copies). 

  Favorite quote: 'You see, we are here, as far as I can tell, to help each 
  other; our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our enemies. That is to 
  help each other and not hurt each other.'
