(_____/ ne of the advantages of using a Mac LC II connected via AppleTalk
to a laser imager for heavy-duty production is that you have a lot of
spare time on your hands.  There are those endless minutes spent waiting
for the screen to update or tasks to switch, and hours spent waiting for
output.  Fortunately, I have an SII Coyote editing terminal on my desk
which has access to the AP Newswire. This provides me with more
entertainment than one person should have. One of the items I came across
recently was a story on 2 new Macintoshes: the Centris 660AV and the
Quadra 840AV.  The fun starts in the first paragraph, where these systems
are described as "mid-priced."  Of course, this is probably from the pen
of a writer who can use the terms "PC" and "easy to use" in the same
sentence.  I now present that story, embellished with the information
that seemed to be missing:

"Apple Computer Inc. plans to introduce a new line of mid-priced
Macintosh computers that talk, recognize voice commands, and read text
back to the user.  Although talking and reading text back to the user
might appear to be the same thing, Apple feels that this one feature can
be made to appear as two by wording it this way.

Apple said that these models would sell for between $2,139 and $6,249,
depending upon how gullible the consumer seemed to be.

Apple's PlainTalk speech recognition software, which may well have been
ripped off from similar Shareware efforts for the Amiga, allows the
machine to misunderstand spoken commands such as "Open File" or "Move
Text" or "Spit out the darn disk NOW!"  Furthermore, it will be able to
read text back in a synthesized voice.

'No other personal computer on the market today can provide all of these
capabilities,' said Ian Diery, completely oblivious to the 4 million
Amigas which have had these capabilities since 1985.

Apple plans to introduce a new color display terminal with built-in
stereo speakers at the phenomenally low price of $800.  When confronted
with the fact that this new monitor, at 640 X 400 resolution, was nothing
more than a VGA monitor with built-in Labtec speakers (Retail: $29.95),
Apple had no comment.  Nor did they have anything to say when it was
pointed out that the consumer could spend $300 or less for a comparable
monitor, and then still have $500 to spend on a stereo system that was
far superior than that provided by the Apple monitor."

I had just barely begun to stop laughing when I came across the results
of the lawsuit brought by Lotus against Borland.  Lotus won their
copyright infringement suit.  Among other things, the judge ruled that
Quattro, marketed by Borland, had copied such things as menu commands,
menu structure, and - perhaps worst of all - the macro key.  I wonder if
it's too late to patent the Save command?

And then I read a story about a 17-year-old computer enthusiast who got
10 years probation for paying an undercover investigator to kill the
boyfriend of a girl he had a crush on.  The payment?  $5.30 and 7 Atari
cartridges.  Perhaps it's just the sick-o in me, but I could have sworn
the going rate was 9 Atari cartridges...

  / /                       by @{" Dennis Schaefer " link Dennis }
 / /  
(_/ his year the SIGGRAPH convention landed in my backyard - Anaheim,
California. SIGGRAPH is, in case you don't know, the world's oldest,
largest and most prestigious of gatherings of people and things relating to
computer graphics. The moniker refers to "Special Interest Group GRAPHICS."
Yes folks, all the big boys were there.

Although the Anaheim Convention Center is across the street from
Disneyland, I did not expect to stand in the Disneyland-type line that
snaked across the lobby. In the forty-five minutes of waiting I did have
plenty of time to peruse the program. In the single afternoon that I spent
there, I knew I would not have time to attend any of the many classes and
seminars with such intriguing titles as "Recent Techniques in Human
Modeling, Animation and Rendering", "How to Lie and Confuse with
Visualization" and "Nan-o-Sex and Virtual Seduction." (!) Not to mention
installation artworks using machine intelligence and virtual reality
(hereinafter referred to as "VR") as "Nuero Baby" and "B*rbie's Virtual
Playhouse." The descriptions of these things are too long to go into here,
but were intriguing to say the least. But I had three large halls of
exhibits to get through, and that was enough! While waiting in line I was
able to pick out a few company names that were familiar to this
increasingly-humble Amiga user, and I resolved to visit them all. All six
of them that is.

The largest exhibits were those belonging to the companies that make
software that runs on high-end workstations such as Silicon Graphics, Sun,
etc. The big three in this arena were Alias, Wavefront and SoftImage.
SoftImage hasn't done much that is very impressive lately, unless you liked
all the dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park"! The Wavefront exhibit boasted a
realtime interactive show in which a 3-d animated disembodied head talked,
moved and made lewd remarks to unfortunate female bystanders, all in
realtime and in response to changing events. The head would make comments
about the young women's hair, clothing and appearance, making it clear that
this was happening in realtime.  I walked into the middle of the exhibit
and found the libidinous author of these remarks decked out in sensors. He
had a VR-type headset on to detect his head movement with the addition of
motion sensors attached to his lips and chin so that the program could
sense his mouth movements. It did not look comfortable...

Evans and Sutherland makes both hardware and software for the killer
high-end military flight simulators. They had two virtual hang-gliders set
up, complete with harness and control bar. In these you could fly through a
"Blade-Runner" type city, amazingly detailed, complete with futuristic
vehicles zipping by, all rendering in real-time! I was able to participate
in another VR exhibit involving a whole town and surrounding countryside
that the user could "drive" through. Picture VistaPro pictures with the
addition of detailed buildings rolling by at 30 frames per second in
stereo! The price of gasoline at the local Mobil station was quite
reasonable at $1.32 for unleaded super....

I finally set off in search of my Amiga brethren. Unfortunately, two of
the Amiga vendors I hoped to see did not have the booths that were listed
in the program: Virtual Reality Laboratories Inc (makers of VistaPro) and
(amazingly!) NewTek. However I did find booths set up by ASDG (makers of
Art Department Professional), Centaur (Opalvision), Realsoft (Real 3d) and
Desktop Video World (publishers of AmigaWorld).

Of the above exhibitors only Centaur was showing products devoted to the
Amiga exclusively. All the others are branching out into other platforms.
At a booth run by a Toaster User's Group I ran into a couple of folks from
NewTek. They told me that they had not set up a booth so that they could
afford to throw a big party the night before to introduce their "Video
Toaster Screamer." Gosh, doesn't NewTek have a gift for product names?

The "Screamer" is the really big news for Amiga Users coming out of
this show. This is an external rendering engine for the Toaster that uses
four parallel MIPS R4400 - 64-bit superpipelined RISC processors. That
description (from the NewTek flyer) is beyond the technical specs of this
writer, but suffice to say that the thing is moving FAST! NewTek claims
that it delivers "twice the computing power of a Cray I supercomputer." It
will retail at $9,995.

As an average Amiga user, you might wonder why this is news for you...
After all, YOU can't afford ten grand for this thing! Well, the thing is
that this price is dirt cheap for the kind of 3-d rendering power it
provides. With shows like Spielberg's "Seaquest DSV" using Lightwave, it
means that more and more television shows will turn to Lightwave and the
Toaster to produce their special effects sequences. And they will need
experienced Lightwave users... It means job opportunities in big show-biz
markets for people who can run this stuff. Not to mention a little respect
in the computer community. And THAT we can all use.

Several companies were conspicuous by their absence. Impulse, (makers
of Imagine, probably the most popular Amiga 3-d program), and DMI, (makers
of several products that purport to compete directly with Silicon Graphics
workstations) were both no-shows. And the biggest disappointment was the
lack of presence by Commodore. Both IBM and Apple had large displays.
Multimedia was a major sub-theme at SIGGRAPH this year, but was the clear-
and-present leader in multimedia clear present? No. If Commodore wants to
be taken seriously by the graphics community it must show its face at
forums like SIGGRAPH.

SIGGRAPH was an amazing experience for this writer, and next year I
plan to take about five times as much time exploring the nooks and
crannies! If you have an interest in computer graphics and/or the future of
virtual entertainment and simulation, check it out in Florida next year.
SIGGRAPH returns to Southern California the year after.

@node tv "Same Time, Same Channel"

 _  __  _                 Same Time, Same Channel
( \/  \/ )                 by @{" Bill Camarota " link billc }
 \      / 
  \_/\_/ hen asked to write an article for Viewport, I wondered what
would be interesting to Amiga users. After some careful consideration, I
have decided to discuss the role of the Amiga in a small market TV
station.

I work as the Art Director for NBC affiliate WMGM TV in Atlantic City,
New Jersey. My background consists of extensive work in graphic design
and photography. I have exhibited my work at the Eastman Kodak Gallery in
NYC as well as having two album covers to my credit. I was approached by
the General Manager of the station four years ago and asked if I wanted a
challenge. I was presently involved with computer artwork and jumped at
the chance to have my work aired on TV.

Since I was working with the Amiga in my own personal endeavors, I
decided to advise the station to purchase two Amiga workstations. I
quickly pumped the two machines up with 16 megs of memory and hard drives.

My first task was to implement graphics for our newscasts. At the time,
the news only had the ability to display text over video or a colored
background. Logo generation was impossible. This was accomplished with a
Chyron VP1 character generator. So, I decided to start to revamp the
process using Shereff Systems Pro Video character generator software.
This allowed me to use 16 color DPaint screens as backgrounds. Working
closely with the News Director, we decided on a "graphic look" for the
station's newscasts. Part of that look included full screen scoreboards
with official MLB, NHL, NFL and NBA logos, weathermaps, locators and
interview tags. Some of you may be thinking, "weathermaps &
scoreboards?". You must realize the station had NO graphic abilities
before I introduced the Amiga.

Now onto the reasons why I picked ProVideo for our titles and screens.
The first reason is the fact that the program is able to store and use up
to 26 banks of 100 pages each. I currently retain a library of 200 pages
that the operator uses to sequence for a newscast. No other program to
date has this enormous capacity. This, coupled with the ability to
preload all my backgrounds and call up pages instantaneously, makes
ProVideo a winner. The program is very quick to respond and has NEVER
crashed during a newscast. Plugging in and editing almost a hundred pages
for the news is a breeze. The final reason is that it is extremely easy
to learn.

Four years later, 50% of the newscast contains Amiga generated graphics.
We now incorporate "over the shoulder" corner inserts and animation
sequences for special series stories.

Well, this concludes my first article. Next month, I will be talking
about scanning and rendering logos, the backbone of my daily tasks. Also
discussed will be reproduction legalities. If anyone has any questions or
suggestions, I can be reached on GEnie. My mailbox address is W.CAMAROTA.
See you next month, SAME TIME, SAME CHANNEL.

   / \                     by @{" deb Christensen " link deb }
  / - \ 
 / ___ \ fter lots of positive feedback from the Art column last month, I'm
(_/   \_) back for a return engagement, highlighting the best of Amiga art.
All of it NEW.

Once again, someone has gathered together an excellent collection of Amiga
graphics in one large file.  13 Winning Pictures from the Southern Party in
Europe are featured in the file: SOUTHERNPARTYGFX.LHA, #20499 on GEnie. In
the set, there are several anime-style pictures, two pictures with women in
various states of nakedness, an incredible batman poster reproduction, and
other nice original art.

But if you think all the Amiga art talents come from Europe, think again!
I'd like to show you some of the beautiful contributions of our own artists
this month.  These are the kinds of pictures that people love to convert
into .GIF files and view on other systems, because they just don't have the
people providing examples of their extraordinary talents!  I've listed some
of my favorites here by picture name, not the archived filename, and cross
referenced it with the GEnie filenumbers.  Filesizes are listed as the
download size of the archived file, if it is compressed.

   AmigaLagoon.JPG   Jim Sachs' gorgeous advertising art for Digital
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Creations' new BRILLIANCE paint program, this is a
 GEnie File #20476   picture of an Amiga in paradise. Sachs has recreated
                     the atmosphere of an island in paradise with stunning
colors and imaginative placement of a computer monitor in the scene. You
can almost hear the waves lapping as you look at it.      Filesize: 259456

        357MAG.IFF   Mike Haas treats us to another detailed, painstaking
        ~~~~~~~~~~   reproduction of a sidearm, this time the famous Smith
 GEnie File #20418   & Wesson .357 Magnum.  Complete with barrel markings
                     and statistics, you'll think you are looking at a
photograph, not a drawing.  You may have already seen Mike's similarly
drawn picture of a government issue semi-automatic pistol in file 20132.

        COAST1.IFF   Matthew Jones, "East coasT," presents his first solo
        ~~~~~~~~~~   Amiga artwork in this philosophical and sharp imaged
 GEnie File #20163   piece.  A study in the right and wrongs, the piece
                     uses black and white in a striking contrast of 3-D
realism and symbolic imagery, with some startling color and effective
shading.  I look forward to seeing more art from him.     Filesize:  23168

      VERONICA.IFF   Eric Gieseke, "SideWinder," has shared another one of
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~   his impressionistic portraits, this time of Veronica.
 GEnie File #20391   You'll enjoy his easy style and fun coloring in this
                     contemporary picture.  A number of his other previous
works also bear his unmistakably carefree and fun pixel work. Look for
other pictures from him in library 19 if Veronica intrigues you.
                                                          Filesize:  21248

       GATE.PCHG7    Charles Lee's incredible rendering of a closed gate
       ~~~~~~~~~~    in a dungeon hallway is flanked by 2 burning torches
 GEnie File #20379   on either side of the gate.  The stone walls look
                     cool and the picture looks as if someone is ready to
walk down the hallway any moment, maybe you.  The atmosphere created in
this scene is tantalizing and picture perfect.            Filesize:  80768

  SPACELAB.HAMLACE   This space station is by an unknown Amiga artist.  If
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   you know who the artist is, I'd appreciate the news.
GEnie File #20403    Pictures like this deserve to have the artist's name
                     on it in lights.  A smooth and beautiful realistic
space station hangs above the planet with the photographic quality of a
post card. The composition and lighting make this almost look like you can
see how it should be moving as it hangs in space.         Filesize:  71936

         DEATHSTAR   Dennis Schaefer's     SILKFLERS.JPEG   Bill Franks
         ~~~~~~~~~   nice rendering        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   pulls together
GEnie File # 20281   in this partial    GEnie File #20124   a  simply
                     view leaves me                         g o r g e o u s
breathless. It's well conceived and     close-up of a silk flower in an
will bring back many memories of the    arrangement. He has used all the
real DeathStar that we all watched      techniques of good floral
on the big screen several times. A      composition for this silky and
must for you Science Fiction fans       velvety rendering.  Pretty!  I'd
everywhere!                             love to see THIS one in AGA.
                                        This is one of my favorites.

                     was obviously carefully planned and rendered.  The
balance is appealing to your eye without looking contrived or symmetrical,
and the details in the scenery lend depth and color without detracting
from the main focus, that singing dragon.   Now all I really want to know
is, "Can I have one for a Pet?"                           Filesize: 101248
                                   -*-
The things that make any picture good, wherever it is, are not easy to
define, and tastes vary.  But class and talent are evident when you can
look at a picture and enjoy it.  Not *BECAUSE* it is on a computer, or
comes from one, but because it is a good picture.  I am absolutely
thrilled to have been able to compile two pages about the gorgeous
pictures which Amiga artists have been busy producing.  I'm even more
thrilled because these are all recent pictures.  I'm hoping to see as
much or more new Amiga art in the next month.  This has been an honor, my
hat goes off to all you hard working and talented Amiga artists!  -*deb!*

(__  __)  TypeSmith: The Professional Amiga Outline Font Editor
  / /                     by @{" Peter Jacobsen " link peterj }
 / /  
(_/ ypeSmith is a very capable outline font editor from Soft-Logik. With
it, one can create and edit PostScript, Compugraphic and Soft-Logik outline
fonts. You can also convert fonts amongst PostScript Type 1, Compugraphic
Intellifont and Soft-Logik DMF Outline formats. You can export to Post-
Script Type 3 format, but you cannot edit or load it.

With its powerful drawing tools you can create new fonts. You can also
import characters and symbols from structured drawing programs. This allows
you to create custom fonts or logos. Using Workbench 2.x or above, you can
load bitmapped pictures and Amiga bitmap fonts as templates so that you can
trace over them. Since TypeSmith does not directly support editing of Amiga
bitmap fonts, this feature gives you a way to create outline fonts from
your bitmap font collection.

I found TypeSmith very easy to use. I particularly liked TypeSmith's
ability to automatically create character widths, and to import kerning
pairs. This makes the editing job so much easier.  With other font editors
I've used, you had to do these things manually.

Not being an artistic person, I was at first reluctant to use the drawing
tools in TypeSmith. After a few aborted attempts, I was able to create my
first outline 'font'. With some practice, I found the tools quite easy to
use and better suited to creating fonts than turning pixels on/off in a
grid like bitmap font editors do.  Another nice feature I found useful, is
the ability to dump a font you're working on to the printer so you can
really see what it will look like. The print quality was excellent on my 24
pin dot matrix.

While I find that TypeSmith does an excellent job creating and editing
outline fonts, I was disappointed that it could not directly be able to
create or edit native Amiga bitmapped fonts. However, I am encouraged by
the fact that that may be added in a future update. Billing itself as 'the
Professional Amiga Font Editor' and not directly supporting bitmapped fonts
seemed odd to me. Even so, I have no problem recommending TypeSmith to
someone who is interested in creating/editing outline fonts.

TypeSmith uses a Workbench 2/3 style interface (still compatible with
Workbench 1.3), is HotLinks compatible, and supports ARexx. The program is
easily installed using Commodore's Installer (included). The manual is
about 175 pages and contains a wealth of background information concerning
what the various font types are, and how to manipulate them within
TypeSmith.

TypeSmith requires a minimum of Workbench 1.3, 2 floppy drives, 2 MB of
memory (512K of CHIP). Workbench 2.x, a hard drive and a multisynch monitor
are highly recommended.

  (_  _)                        Helm Review
   / /                        By @{" John Evers " link johne }
 _/ /  
(____) f you have visited the STARSHIP in the last month, you probably
couldn't escape me talking about an incredible new program called Helm from
Eagle Tree Software. What is Helm? If you took DeluxePaint, CanDo, ImageFX,
and Hyperbook, and rolled them into one program, you would probably get an
idea of what Helm is. Basically, Helm is a software authoring program that
lets you build your own working programs and presentations with a minimum
of effort. I'm talking REAL programs here. In fact, I am typing this review
into a word processor that I made myself! My homemade word processor has
cut, copy, and paste using the clipboard, search and replace, text styles,
and full printing capabilities. It could have even more features if I would
have spent more than 10 minutes making it. Would you like to build your own
paint program? How about an AGA paint program with HAM8 support, image
processing, and animation capabilities? This might take you a bit longer.
Better set aside at least 20 minutes for this one! All this from a guy
who never even wrote an AREXX script! Let me tell you more...

Helm will run on any Amiga with at least 1 meg of memory and at least
Workbench 1.3, although 2.04 or higher is recommended. It will also take
full advantage of an FPU and the AGA chipset. The Helm package comes on 7
disks, but the actual Helm program only takes up half a floppy. The other 6
disks are full of example "Books" and artwork for you to use in your own
creations. The Helm manual is a 336 page work of art. If only all
manuals could be so helpful, comprehensive, and full of examples as this
one. Multiple screen shots and diagrams make this manual the best I have
ever seen for any of my programs! )

The program is very easy to use. Everything you need to make your program
is in Helm, including text editors, and full painting and drawing tools.
You can use Helm's structured drawing tools to make a background, and maybe
add some shapes. Then you add your fields. Fields are rectangles that you
draw onto the screen that can have different functions. You can draw a
Textfield, and enter text into it, or have it import an ASCII file. You can
make an Imagefield, and draw a picture or an animation into it. You can
also draw fields for selectors, timers, buttons, even charts. To every
object, you can add either an action or a script. An action event is a
function you can set up by pointing and clicking. If you really want to get
into it, Helm has it's own scripting language called "Breeze". It really is
a breeze to write a script in Helm. Lets say that I have a button in my
program called "Fishbone", and when I click on it with the left (selection)
button of my mouse, I want the button to turn dark red, and say the name of
the button. Here is the script for that button.

On SelectUp ;when the button is clicked on, and my finger is released
  begin
    set the color of me to dark red
    say the name of me
  end

That's about as hard as it gets, and most of the time, you won't even have
to write a script. Of course, you can get Helm to do more complicated
functions. It has full math functions, serial port control, and can even
control a genlock, a CDTV, or the Picture-in-Picture function of a GVP
IV24 board!

All this good stuff must come at a price, right? Well, the retail price of
Helm is $129, but if you let Eagle Tree Software know that you are a member
of GEnie, you can get the whole package for $79 !

By now I guess you get the impression that I like this product. Your right,
I do. What an incredible feeling it is to think of a program you would like
to use, and then being able to say, "Hey! I can make that myself!" I bought
a number of products over the years that promised me I could program the
Amiga. I couldn't catch the vision of AmigaVision, and with CanDo, I just
couldn't do it. With Helm, I'm really at the helm, and I'm loving every
minute of it.

Editor's Addendum -

Jerrell Nickerson, author of Helm, describes the manual as a "Technical
Reference," which is somewhat short on tutorials. Although he is working
to correct this, some people will find it a bit tricky to get the hang of
the Helm environment.  However, Jerrell is always available online to
answer questions, and there are a variety of Helm applications appearing
in the *StarShip* library.  Listed below are several files that will
introduce you to Helm and demonstrate some of its capabilities:

   / /                       by @{" Nick Cook " link nick }
 _/ /  
(____)  must confess there's not much software in the MS-DOS world that I
appeals to me. I mean, how many spreadsheets does a person need? but the
one thing I have longed for is the "quick and dirty" software, the kind
that usually has a pronoun in the title like "My Mailing List," "My
Inventory," "My Thermonuclear Bomb" (just kidding on that last one,
folks). I know it is possible to perform the same tasks with a word
processor or general database program, but frankly, that's a hassle. Some
of those small, dedicated programs have finally reached us in Amigadom.

Legendary Design Technologies in Ontario, Canada, produces Address-It!,
an address (and other useful bits of information) database and printer
utility. After entering data, you can sort, and display the information.
The program prints envelopes, labels, address books and telephone rotary
cards. Address-It! also exports to ProWrite, WordPerfect, or ASCII, and
imports from programs which create ASCII delimited files (such as some
databases). Pull down menus, mouse and keyboard shortcuts access
functions.

A @{"record template" system "WDisplay address1"} contains the expected fields: name, address, phones (up
to three numbers, all which Address-It! can dial), and so forth. In
addition, there's a user definable field and room for four lines of
general comments. You type in your data, using the "return" key or mouse
to move between fields. For repetitive items (e.g., states), Address-It!
offers lists of commonly used entries designed to reduce typing. The
program comes built in with lists of salutations, major cities, states,
Canadian provinces and several major countries. A good idea, but I didn't
care much for its implementation. For example, I created a base with
numerous New York, NY addresses. To use the lists, I had to take my right
hand off the keys, click the field name, scroll through the list of
states, and double click on "NY." That's a great deal of work to save
typing two letters. The ratio of moves saved to typing increases with
longer entries, as "New York," I still prefer not having to take my hands
off the keyboard in the midst of typing an entry and grab the mouse. A
way to access the lists by way of the keyboard (e.g., allowing the user
to assign frequently used states to function keys) would be welcome.

A powerful Address-It! feature is a bank of 15 button-like "flags" that
you can define and set. These flag "yes/no" or "on/off" kinds of
variables. Once defined, you click on whichever flags you want to set for
that record. This is more convenient than typing "Y" or "N." If you are
about to enter several addresses which require the same flag(s), you can
set the software to flag automatically each entered record.

Records can be searched by direction (e.g., ascending or descending),
type (i.e., upper or lower case), fields (including ZIP code, helpful for
bulk mailing) and/or specific text. Address-It! will simply find the
records, or find the records and tag them for printing or exporting).
Search parameters are easily entered through mouse clicks.

Address data displays can be as records or in a @{"browse format" system "WDisplay address2"}  In the
latter mode, each record is typed in a single line, allowing an overall
view of the what you've entered. You're able to change the appearance of
the browse format quite a bit; select different fields for display, alter
field size, and even designate the name format.

This list can be printed as a master list. Unfortunately, Address-It!
insists on a Hires screen. I couldn't get it to open in any other size.
This limits the amount of data available on screen without scrolling.

Setting up a printer to work correctly on continuous feed labels can send
you screaming to the funny farm fast. I could have paid for this program
if I had a nickel for each set of labels I've ruined as I've attempted to
print them!  Fortunately, Address-It! handles printing with aplomb. The
program's defaults include three sizes of address book pages, rotary
telephone cards, labels, and envelopes, plus custom settings if none of
the above fits your needs. Those defaults can be altered and saved.
Address-It! automatically provides you with an on-screen preview of your
label or envelope or whatever, so you can proof it before printing.
Additionally for output, the US Postal Service address guidelines (i.e.,
all caps, no punctuation, and city, state and ZIP code on one line) can
be toggled on or off through a configuration menu.

I entered my home address, and tagged it for printing. I loaded a batch
of continuous feed labels into my dot matrix, selected "Print" and let
'er rip. It worked, except the labels were double spaced. The manual
suggested that the page width needed adjustment. I did so, then printed
again. Eureka! The addresses ended up where they were supposed to be!
Single spaced! This sure bets the heck out of mucking around with printer
definitions in a word processing or database program. One small glitch:
the printer remained steadfastly in draft mode, and refused to print in
NLQ. This may be the fault of my preferences driver, though, and not of
Address-It! The program supports HP Lasers, including a landscape option,
but alas, I don't have access to one for testing.

I had some minor trouble with the WordPerfect export. For those of you
not familiar with WordPerfect, its mail merge function requires two
files: a "secondary file" of data fields (e.g., names and addresses) and
a "primary file" (e.g., a form letter). Address-It! exported the tagged
files as a formatted secondary file. However, WordPerfect shrieked that
the file was improper when I attempted to use it. If I pulled the
Address-It! created file into WordPerfect, then saved it back out, the
merge worked like clockwork.

The 39 page, indexed manual guides the user through the program's features
in a concise and quite complete manner. For example, instead of referring
the user to the Amiga manuals, Chapter One discusses the standard AmigaDOS
gadgets used in the program without sounding condescending. Unfortunately,
the manual is as poorly printed as it is well written. The haphazard
printing cheapens the overall package and presents an amateurish
impression, despite the quality of the manual's writing.

Address-It! plugs a very real gap in Amiga software, and Legendary Design
Technologies deserves kudos for this program. It crams a great deal of
functionality and flexibility into a small, well-thought-out package. I
can summarize Address-It! in two words: Buy-It!

   / \/ \                   IMAGE MASTER v.9.23
  /      \               by @{" Les And Clive Watts " link watts }
 / /\  /\ \ 
(_/  \/  \_) any graphics enthusiasts will have encountered the numerous
problems of having spent hours producing a masterpiece - only to lose it
before they had time to save it or whilst trying to transfer it into and/or
combine it with, the useful parts of another program for further
treatment.

Image Master is a great leap forward in the relief of this situation - it
accepts almost every type of output format available from the Amiga; it
also CONVERTS them into 24-bit pictures for internal manipulation. Not
only is all the work carried out within this one "Jack of all Trades"
program it is also able to be performed within the more exacting criteria
of this much higher definition mode. You then have the option of
returning it to its original form : 16-colour, HAM, Low-res, Hi-res, with
or without interlace - but now edited in an improved and upgraded
quality, or for onward processing in another 24-Bit program. Be warned
that you can"t change what isn't there - and though importing HAM
pictures into Image Master and manipulating them within this program will
give a much better eventual result, THAT result will not be as good as if
it had been constructed/grabbed into a 24-bit system in the first
instance, before loading into Image Master for manipulation.

I believe the version I tested included the most recent upgrade. However,
parts of the program appeared not to be covered in the manual whereas,
conversely, the manual appeared to describe functions which I could not
find in the program. Such an infinitely variable and complex production
as this program, does need a more simplified guide, if its appeal is to
attract the widest possible selection of the Amiga population, with their
varying levels of competence. Indeed, I suspect that even the most ardent
and experienced graphics enthusiast might encounter difficulties for the
first few hours in trying to avoid the pitfalls of this maze. As it
was, many of my tests had to be done by trial and error and/or with a
little intelligent guesswork.

The programmers seem to hold Digi-View in high esteem. So much so that
special provisions have been provided within this program to accept a
direct input from Digi-View with its hardware installed and that program
running. It is only a matter of opinion but one of my most frustrating
learning curves was with early versions of Digi-View. My results with
it were never satisfactory to me. My best recent frame grabs, from the
lower priced end of the market, were with VideoMaster which,
unfortunately, is aimed at the A500+. As the Image Master recommendation
was for a minimum of 4Mb of RAM [accelerator board only "advised" - so I
left it out], I was obliged to use an A2000. I finally decide to use
Vidi-Amiga 12 for grabbing.

One can see from its requirements that it is a very memory hungry
program. I found 4Mb barely enough. This is because 24-bit programs
absorb roughly four times the amount of memory that a HAM program
might. Logically this, by simple calculation, reduces the "effective"
memory of a 4Mb system, relative to the requirement for a HAM picture, to
that of a 1Mb machine.

Image Master runs on "Buffers" [memories] into which one loads the
various pictures.  The Primary Buffer is where the first picture is
loaded. This is the one immediately displayed on the screen. With only
one picture loaded, the Primary Image, some of the other operations are
"ghosted" and only limited processing of THAT picture is possible. These
operations are controlled by the Process Panel. One should not be
daunted by this, for the Process Panel controls over 70 individual  and
multiple activities - some of which can be combined to produce an infinite
permutation of effects. These include the "standard" adjustments for
colour, gamma, brightness and contrast as well as high/low pass filters and
such special effects as "line art", "smear", "posterise", "water
colour","asterize", "colour key" and "shine" - to name but a few!

The Secondary Buffer is not necessarily the second picture loaded.
It could be a Brush or Clip obtained by cutting out part of the Primary
Image.

An unusual aspect of this program is that there are no preset
"tools" with convenient icons to select them. Everything and anything
seems to be available, with size,colour, shape, etc, at the total
discretion of the user. Even the thickness of the Line Tool is
infinitely adjustable. If you have created a Brush from another
picture, you can use that shape to paint with. There is no magnify
tool as such but as soon as one selects an area of the Primary Image as a
clip or brush it goes into a Secondary Buffer. When swapped with the
existing Primary Image and put on to the screen; no matter how small the
area chosen it is displayed at full screen size. You then have the
ability to manipulate each enlarged pixel. Should you require even more
enlargement you simply make another "brush" from the previous enlarged
brush ad-infinitum. Dependent upon the process being used, each clip
memorises its parent. When you have finished your alterations it can be
returned home to its original size and take its place in the original
picture.

The Process and Paint Panels operate on the Primary Image only but
the Compose Panel operates on the Primary Image using information taken
from the Secondary Image [but held in memory]. All these controlling
panels - the Process Panel the Compose Panel and the Paint Panel in
turn lead into other specific panels which then present about forty more
alternative selection buttons to choose from, many of which then lead
into further panels with many more alternative choices. The permutations
seem endless.

Confused? Perseverance and patience is required. After a few hours
with the program pleasing results begin to appear, during which time you
discover that an accelerator board is ESSENTIAL. Without an accelerator
board it is not unusual for a process to take several minutes. Some of
the more complicated one's take over 25 minutes! Only seconds WITH an
accelerator board.

The Paint Panel is really provided to colour the picture [on
screen] delegated as the Primary Image, with solid colours or tints by
the "normal" methods of area fill/paint. Image Master is not defined as a
paint program but to show its versatility, you could add, subtract,
modify coloured shapes to form respectable pictures. These pictures can
eventually have the special effects treatment from the other parts of
the program applied to them.

It is possible to load Amiga fonts into Image Master and, if text is
made into a brush, it can be "stamped" down in place using "Combine" from
the Compose Panel. You need to load the Colour Text program on the
Amiga to be able to use colour fonts.

I ought to mention to those video-philes interested in the wonders
of Chroma Keying, who have a genlock, this program will enable the
still effect of Chroma Keying under four different headings, each of
which technically allows you to select the Colour 0 to be any one of
the 16 million plus on offer. The four headings are:

Min Merge - this takes the whole of the existing secondary image, reduces
it to the size of the space you have chosen, on the primary, and inserts
it. The Colour 0 is selected by a slider adjustment where you decide to
make the transparent colour brighter than the Primary Image.

Max Merge - This does the same process but the transparent colour is chosen
to be darker than the Primary Image colour of the area in question.

Colour Key Min Merge which offers the same process but this one affects
colours Close to the chosen merge colour.

Colour Key Max Merge does the same again but affects colours far from the
chosen colour.


During the five consecutive [18 hour] days I have worked with this program,
I doubt if I have touched even half of its potential. There are parts of it
which have disappointed me such as "warping", "explosion", "cylindrical
wrapping", and the "oil paint" finish was as disappointing to me as the
"water colour" finish was delightful, but perhaps my subjects were
unsuitable. I had little success with the "Morphing" function. It is simple
enough in its operation, but one can only view it in colour within the
program as a "film strip". However an associate of mine using Image Master
and a 24-bit scanner has produced a very impressive demonstration "looped
morph" in high definition colour - of four different heads.

All in all, ImageMaster is a fantastic program for use on its own or to
"clean up" past favourite "works of art" to extend and improve them for
future use. If you decide you can only afford one program and "value for
money" is of prime importance; because of its overall versatility, Image
Master must be very near to the top of the list.

To those interested in using the Amiga's graphics capabilities
to the full, Image Master really does offer the best of all worlds!

 ______             The Microbotics 1230XA Accelerator
(__  __)                      by @{" Joe Luk " link joel }
  / /   
 / /  echnology sure has come a long way from the days of the room-sized
(_/  monsters. Measuring less than a handspan in length, the MicroBotics
M1230XA accelerator packs up to 128 megabytes of memory, a 50MHz 68030
processor, a 50MHz 68882 math coprocessor, and a battery-backed clock
into your A1200.

The first thing that will strike you about the M1230XA, besides its tiny size,
is the fact that the board is covered with sockets of all kinds.  A pair of DIP
sockets allow the CPU and FPU to be run at different speeds, though a jumper
allows you to run both off the same clock if desired.  On the reverse side is
a pleasant surprise: a SIMM socket with easy-release metal tabs, not the
extremely frustrating plastic deals used by many boards.  Also socketed are the
clock chip (removable if you already have a clock), and a controller chip.

Because of its elegantly modular design, the M1230XA is available in many
configurations.  Officially, it is available with your choice of a 33 or 50MHz
68030, or 40MHz 680EC030 (MMU-less) CPU, though the configuration software
also supports a 25MHz processor.  The software supports a 68881 or 68882 FPU
at these speeds: 20, 25, 33, 40, 50, or 60MHz (the final case is unlikely
to be available at the current time).  RAM sizes of any binary power (1, 2,
4MB, etc) is supported at speeds from 40ns to 100ns.

Many vendors take advantage of the board's flexibility by "custom-tailoring"
configurations.  For example, my board was shipped from the factory with a
40MHz CPU, no RAM, and no FPU.  I ordered a 50MHz CPU+FPU combination with
4MB of RAM, and the board arrived with those options installed.  Configuration
is stored on an EEPROM (for convenient software configuration), but the
board also has hard-coded factory defaults -- this is how I determined that
my dealer did some custom work on my board.  Though it wasn't factory-pristine,
the board was less expensive because more "shopping" was done for the parts.

Installation of the M1230XA is simple: pop out the trapdoor on the bottom of
the A1200, align the connectors, and push the board in.  Hardware tweaking
is normally unnecessary; there are two jumpers on the board: one which
determines whether or not an FPU is present, and one which enters a special
test mode used to bypass a "confused" EEPROM.  About the only users who will
need to touch the hardware are people with internal clocks already
installed -- disabling the M1230XA clock involves pulling out a small DIP chip.

Once the hardware is installed, you will run into one of the board's
limitations: it does not auto-configure its memory under Kickstart 3.0.
MicroBotics promises that KickStart 3.1 fixes this problem, but in the
meantime you are instructed to run the SetXA configuration utility at bootup
to add the memory.  Because this step takes place fairly late in the
startup, certain libraries will have been loaded into slower CHIP RAM.  Much
of this can be avoided using a PD utility called "ROMTagMem", which adds the
memory much sooner in the boot process.  This utility is available in th
*StarShip* library as file #20534, ROMTAGMEM.LHA, 6016 bytes.

If just putting some FAST RAM into an A1200 makes the machine much faster,
adding a 68030 makes it cruise with the responsiveness of a jet aircraft.
AIBB test results and other notes from my 50MHz version using ROMTagMem
can be found in the *StarShip* library as file #20535.

The M1230XA is also Jim Drew's "official" accelerator for his Emplant
emulator package, due to be released for the A1200 soon.  An MMU is "strongly
recommended" for proper Macintosh emulation, and therefore boards which use
the 68EC030, such as GVP's A1230, are not suitable.

Caveats: in addition to not auto-configuring its memory, the M1230XA has
some small shortcomings.  First, if you have a hard disk and a 25-watt (A600)
power supply, MicroBotics recommends that you get a heftier one.  The board
draws 600 milliamps.  The A500 power supply, which is 10 watts stronger,
has worked for me, but there are other options such as the 200-watt monster
Bigfoot 500 power supply ($129, Micro R&D).

My only other complaint is that at 50MHz, the board runs somewhat hotter
than I'm comfortable with.  I have installed a small fan which sits in the
empty popout space underneath the disk drive, and it has kept the board
at a comfortable temperature.  The heat is not an M1230XA problem per se,
since other people with boards such as CSA's Twelve Gauge have reported
similar discomfort.

The board includes MicroBotics' SetXA configuration software and its RAM
diagnostic software on my rev. 1.0 disk.  It comes with a one-year warranty
and concise but thorough and easy to follow documentation.
Above all, the greatest thing about the M1230XA is that its creators did not
skimp in places which others consider commonplace.  This means high quality
chip and SIMM sockets, a one-year warranty, and room for future expansion
if you buy a less loaded board now.  It also means that seemingly little things
like plastic ears on SIMM sockets won't haunt you.

MicroBotics' suggested USA retail prices as specified in its press release
are:
$399 (40MHz EC030)
$429 (33MHz 68030)
$499 (50MHz 68030)

All prices are without FPU or RAM.

I did some shopping and purchased my board from Memory World, which advertises
a 50MHz board with no RAM or FPU for $349.

 ______
(__  __)                Fast IDE on the Amiga 4000?
  / /                   by @{" Chris Papademetrious " link chrisp }
 / /  
(_/  here is no doubt about it, the Amiga 4000 is currently king of the
hill when it comes to workstation-level Amigas. Its fast processor, AGA
chipset, and incredible expandability give it the most potential of any of
the Amiga line. One aspect of the Amiga 4000's design has been constantly
criticized since its introduction, and that is the IDE (Intelligent Drive
Controller) hard drive interface built into the machine. Traditionally, the
Amiga has always used the inherently faster SCSI interface for its hard
drives, but the Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000 were the first machines to break
this long tradition with their integrated IDE controllers. The Amiga 4000
comes with a 3.5" Seagate 3144AX IDE hard drive, and that is where the fun
began.

When I upgraded my trusty Amiga 3000 to a shiny new Amiga 4000, I was
very excited about all the extra horsepower and glitzy graphics. The hard
drive, on the other hand, left me wanting much more. As any proud owner
will attest to, the Amiga 3000's hard drive performance is just about
unparalleled, with startup times on the order of seconds. The Amiga 4000,
on the other hand, had rather unremarkable performance and truly dismal
startup times. The worst problem was that during a startup or a reset, it
seemed to take at least ten seconds to even find the drive! While this
may not seem like much, it was very annoying compared with the
half-second or so it seemed to take the old Amiga 3000. As a programmer
(who crashes a lot) I know that every second during the startup sequence
counts!

As many of you know, I also work at a computer dealer with sells both
Amigas and MS-DOS compatible systems. While building a workstation for a
customer, we attempted to use a Conner CP30544 IDE hard drive as the main
drive. We put together his '486 system with the drive and all the many
various cards required to build a clone. However, when the system was
powered up, the hard drive didn't work! During the entire week, we went
through many different theories and a few different IDE controllers, but
to no avail. Eventually, convinced that the drive was defective, we
ordered a new drive. When the new drive arrived and was installed,
however, the exact same problems resulted. After a call to Conner tech
support, however, we were quite suprised: it turns out that we needed a
special high-speed IDE controller for use with this drive! Hey, I said to
myself, this sounds like an interesting test for the store's Amiga 4000!
I took a screwdriver and the extra drive we now had, and went to check it
out.

Wow! This drive was fast! Formatting a test 20MB partition took a bit
over ten seconds, and when I formatted the entire drive, I began to get
annoyed that it was taking a few minutes until I realized that it was
formatting well over a megabyte per second. Best of all, startups no
longer took forever! As I discovered, the lengthy pause of a stock Amiga
4000 is not due to the IDE controller, but rather the standard Seagate
drive itself. When the drive is replaced with the Conner, startup times
are easily as fast as the fastest I've seen on an Amiga 3000, if not
faster. DiskSpeed 4.1 by Michael Sinz reported very quick performance,
but did make one flaw of the 4000's IDE controller obvious. The IDE
interface uses the CPU to move data around, so during intensive drive
access, the CPU is heavily loaded. In contrast, the DMA SCSI system used
in the Amiga 3000 and A4091 cards leaves the processor free during heavy
drive access.

I am quite happy that I found a hard drive to make my Amiga 4000 reach its
potential. Icons now literally fly onto the screen, and loading all but the
largest programs is almost instantaneous. The stock Seagate 3144AX was
depressing, but by using the Conner CP50540 in its place, I was able to
skip spending the extra money for an A4091 and a SCSI-II drive. Admittedly,
using IDE is still not as fast as using an A4091 SCSI-II controller with a
SCSI-II drive, but for the power-hungry-on-a-budget, this drive and the
Amiga 4000 are a match made in heaven. I couldn't be happier! Well...

(______/ ear Dr. Download: My boss is an idiot. My job is boring. The
commute is hell. I am so tense when I get home, it's all I can do not to
punt Fluffy, the poodle, into the next state. What should I do?
     (signed) Tense

Dear Tense:
With the stress of everyday living, I suggest you honestly explore your
feelings, share your frustrations with a loved one, take a deep breath,
then blow away anything you can with a withering blast from your laser.

Passively and non-violently, of course.

Zerberk (#19935 ZERBERK12.LHA, 112128 bytes) is Matthias Bock's variation
on the arcade game "Berzerk." You joystick jockey through various levels
(don't touch those pulsating electric walls!) blasting the Centurion Robots
and Elexerion Robots as you go. But beware of the pursuing Otto, the most
loathsome, hideous monster of them all. He looks like a giant, circa 1970s'
happy face! AAAIIEEEE! Now, _that's_ the stuff of nightmares.

Or pick up one of the most disgusting files I've ever seen: ARoach (#20025
AROACH.LHA, 10368 bytes). This, ah, game plants huge, repulsive cockroaches
on your screen. These insects scurry for cover under the nearest open
window. Close or move the window, and the bugs run for cover again. Now,
take your mouse pointer and squish the gross things. Splat! I didn't
promise the results would be neat. You can configure the number of roaches;
if they're squishable or not; speed and the public screen they live on,
among other things. You'll be telling yourself how revolting Stefan
Winterstein's program is...between giggles. Bet your friends don't have
_this_ on Windows! Requires AmigaDOS 2.0 +

If you're jealous because the Windows crowd can play "Minesweeper," Alain
Laferriere's ArmyMiner comes to the rescue (#20022 AMYMINERV1.3.LZH, 68352
bytes)! Armyminer works under 1.3 and 2.0, either on PAL or NTSC. It
requires no external libraries whatsoever. Just point-and-click your way to
oblivion. To be honest, I find Minesweeper games somewhat pointless, but
ArmyMiner is a solid Amiga version.

Tired of the carnage yet? If so, try some mind games. Teachers and parents,
pay particular note to this next group!

Wheel (#20100 AV_WHEEL2.LHA, 22656 bytes) is Jeff Carver's AmigaVision
version of the famous (and copyrighted) game show, W****l o* F*****e. Even
though there's no V**** W****, up to four players can spin the wheel, and
take a crack at solving the problem. Wheel is short on bells and whistles,
but it does include a utility to let you create your own puzzles. And you
thought you'd never say "I'd like to buy a vowel" to your Amiga, did you?
Requires AmigaVision or the AmigaVision Player module, at least one meg of
RAM, hard drive or 2 floppy drives.

Carver's back with Yahtze (#20123 AV_YAHTC.LHA, 21504 bytes) a simple
simulation of the classic board game. Like Wheel, Yahtze is not a game but
rather a complex interactive presentation created with AmigaVision. Just
like the board game, the objective is to get a score in 13 different
categories by rolling five dice.  The highest score at the end of 13 turns
wins. I never understood this game as a kid, and I don't understand it as
an adult. But Carver includes the rules, and the game plays well. Like
Wheel, Yahtze requires AmigaVision or the AmigaVision Player module, at
least one meg of RAM, hard drive or 2 floppy drives.

Concentrate (#20237 CONCENTRATE101.LHA, 121856 bytes) is Jody Gustafsona's
charming computer version of the classic memory game. Two humans can play,
or one human can challenge the custom chip intelligence of her Amiga (set
for one of three levels of competency). You simply click on two cards and
attempt to pick up a pair. If you do, a burst of electronic applause
rewards you (however, the applause at the end of the game sounds
unpleasantly like a rifle barrage). The game sports stereo sound effects,
and includes a MED song you can multitask with the game. I didn't miss the
music; the sound effects were fine. In a creative twist, Gustafsona uses
some familiar WorkBench icons as cards. Also included as a second program
that allows you to create your own card decks. This Shareware program is
worth the $10 fee.

                               * * *

Dere Dr. Downlod:
I kneed help with my arithmatick. I kan't seem to get it. Do youse hav any
sugggestions? By the way, I hod a bachaloers degree frm a phamus
uneversity.
     (signed) Give Me the Ball, Coach

Dear Give:
Try LCD Calculator (#19996 LCDCAL2A.LHA, 47872 bytes). As the name implies,
the program opens a full-screen, multi function, color LCD calculator.
Input your data by way of keyboard or mouse. Be sure to download file
19996--the previous upload crashed on launch (much to author Mike Haas'
embarrassment). This version can save a record of all calculator
transactions in a cumulatively-opened text file, date/time-stamped, and/or
print a hard copy in a format similar to printing calculators, with each
logging destination function independently of each other. LCD Calculator
prefers to live in your Sys:Utilities drawer; any place else may require a
"change directory" command. Shareware, $15.

                                * * *

Dear Dr. Download:
I love Barry Manilow music. My favorite foods are white bread, Tuna Helper
and mashed potatoes. I drive a white, four-dour Chevrolet Impala with an
automatic transmission. My friends say I'm boring. What can I do?
     (signed) Needs Excitement

Zzzzzzz. What? Ah, oh,

Dear Needs:
Well, a couple of files will spice up the ol' computer screen. MagicWB
(#20138 MAGICWB.LHA, 490240 bytes) is a _huge_ download with over 160 files
containing new 8 color WorkBench system icons, over 40 new patterns (bonus:
save those unused patterns! You can import them into DPaint as brushes),
and two new fonts to redesign completely your WorkBench screen. The sample
WorkBench screen grab furnished is absolutely stunning. But before you get
excited, keep a couple of things in mind: (i) to look its best, MagicWB
needs to run in a screen resolution of HiRes Interlace or better, so you'll
need a flicker fixer, a multiscan or non-interlace monitor, or just live
with the flicker; (ii) the icons' files are significantly larger (around
2657 bytes each) than the standard icons (1753 for the largest old icon).
Unfortunately, that stopped my installation right there--I don't have the
hard drive space to spare. You know you've gotten a large download when you
unpack the GEnie file----and find _another_ archive! The MagicWB archive
does provide an icon-driven script to unpack it, but its set to copy the
multitude of files to your System: directory. Given the size of the
archive, I suggest you manually unpack it, and direct the output to a
floppy disk instead. Included are three Install routines, for the new RAM:
icon, the System: icons, and to update the drawer icons. The first two
didn't work for me (I didn't try the last one, though). The text whized
through the console window so fast I couldn't exactly see what went wrong.
I couldn't find anything reading the script through a text editor, either.
The outcome is they didn't work for me. Martin Huttenloher's docs are
concise and understandable, and he includes NickPrefs, an ancillary program
MagicWB requires. Despite not having a rousing success  with MagicWB, I'm
saving this one for the happy day I replace my stock 1084S monitor and move
my BridgeBoard stuff onto its own hard drive. I keep thinking about that
gorgeous WorkBench example--I want mine like it! Shareware - $20.

Another way to punch up the WorkBench is with a new pointer. Pointers 2.0
(#19933 POINTERS2.0.LHA 88064 bytes) contains 120 pointer images. All the
separate pointers, as well as a master IFF graphic showing all of them, are
provided. While the artistic merit of some of these pointers is dubious
(the woman's torso pointer struck me as more gruesome than sexy), you
should find an image to your liking here.

                                 * * *

Dear Dr. Download:
Wimps! The Amiga is for wimps! Music, graphics, games...sissy stuff! A REAL
MAN'S computer has acres of spreadsheets, tax programs spreading as far as
the eye can see, more word processors than a secretarial pool! A REAL MAN
likes to go mano-a-mano with the operating system, asserting his
superiority over electronic nature! REAL MEN want it big and hard! Big hard
drives! Big DOS files! Big .EXE files! Big memory!
     (signed) E. Hemingway

Dear E.:
Loved your story about the big fish. Here's some utilities to add to your
drive.

Billed as the fastest GIF viewer on Amiga, FastGIF II (#20140
FASTGIF2.08.LHA, 48000 bytes) uses a GUI interface, a file-requester,
gadgets, and multiple select to display GIF images. FastGIF II takes
advantage of the AGA chipset and shows the images up to 256 colors. Alas.
other Amiga owners have to settle for 256 color images converted into 32
color greyscale; FastGIFF II doesn't convert into HAM as do some GIF
viewers. That's a bit of a disappointment, but the greyscale conversion is
good, and the program _is_ fast. For $35 shareware fee to French author NN,
you'll receive a registered version of FastGIFF II that allows you to save
a GIF as an IFF.

One thing that "broke" under 2.0 is RAD, the recoverable RAM device.
StatRam (#20051 STATRAM21.LHA, 6400 bytes) is Richard Waspea and Nicola
Salmoria's fast, very recoverable ram drive. It works on any Amiga using
V2.04 or greater. StatRam maintains the remarkable recoverability of the
original VD0, but has now been totally re-written to handle any DOS
filesystem, be named what you like, and give back memory from deleted files
instantly. You have to modify your startup-sequence and perhaps add an
entry to your mountlist, but the directions included for StatRam's
installation are concise and easy to understand.

One of Commodore's more gracious moves recently was releasing the hypertext
AmigaGuide to public domain. A number of text files, docs, and cybermags
(like Viewport!) are turning up in the format. However, AmigaGuide text
files can be huge! Well, necessity is the mother of kludging. Bill
Sorensen's PPguide (#20233 PPGUIDE.LHA, 9472 bytes) shows both PowerPacked
and normal .guide files. It requires the PowerPacker and AmigaGuide
libraries. Install ppguide, e.g., in your "c" directory, then you can
PowerPack your .guides, and view them normally by changing the icon's
default tool to "ppguide." I tried it on July's issue of Viewport, and it
worked just fine.

If you create AmigaGuide files, you'll find Roger Nedel's BadLinks (#20110
BADLINK117.LHA, 22656 bytes) a real timesaver. It automates the tedious
task of debugging. This CLI utility checks a .guide file to see if all the
nodes and links match up. BadLink creates two RAM: text files, one for
nodes, one for invalid links. I used the hapless July Viewport again as a
guinea pig. BadLink quickly checked the .guide, and reported two invalid
links. Opps.

The Guru may be gone from Workbench 2.0+, but his infamous numbers remain!
Alert 1.0 (#20223 ALERT111.LHA, 16000 bytes), by Stefan Zeiger, gives you a
detailed description of the alert number. Just drop the program in your C
directory. CLI and 2.0+ only.

Follow Up
In a review of STARSHIP2.0 last month, I commented that I was having
trouble getting the manual (a Notebook file) to work. STARSHIP's author,
Russ Grasso, dropped me some email to tell me the fix: I needed to execute
an "Assign fonts:" to the fonts included with STARSHIP. That worked! The
manual is gorgeous--47 color pages, some illustrated with astronomy photos
(the manual also a good demo for Notebook!). Russ also wrote that, while
the positions of the stars are accurate, the ship speeds are fiction.

#%@*$#@#*&%#%!!!!!

For me, KastleKumquat (#19976 KASTLEKUMQUAT.LHA, 142464 bytes) is the pits.
Following the instructions in the long library description, I created the
disk. It boots, it loads, it plays music, it hangs. Same problem with
Blaster (#19936 BLASTER.LHA, 290304 bytes), and "Degrader" didn't help.

@Node Jim " About Jim Meyer "

JIM MEYER was one of the first consumers to take an Amiga home, and
he hasn't been without one (or two or three) since.  When Jim isn't

@Node Peg " About Peg Herrington "

Peg Herrington, who can be found in the *StarShip* when she's not pounding
out another issue of GEnie's LiveWire magazine, recently applied for
authorization to change her name to J.Peg Herrington. She is an original
Amigan, having experienced it when it was called the Lorraine in a hidden
booth in an exhibit at a Chicago trade show. Her claim to fame is having
eaten a hamburger cooked by Jay Miner in his very own kitchen.

@Node deb " About deb Christensen "

If you think telecommunicating is impersonal, then you've never talked with
Deb Christensen online. It's an experience you won't soon forget. Known far
and wide as *deb!*, she's been online since the early 1980s and even survived
running the telecommunications division of Commmodore Business Machines at
West Chester. An Amiga artist and musician, many of *deb!*'s popular
creations may be downloaded from the *StarShip* Library.

@Node Syl "About Sylvia Lutnes"

SYLVIA LUTNES - also known as Crickets - attended Hunter College in Manhattan,
where she majored in Art, Philosophy, and Geology.  When that didn't
pan out, she studied music at Dalcroze Music School, and was even
observed singing Christmas carols on a NY subway.  Syl finally came
to her senses and discovered computers, became a programmer, and took
up with her Amiga.  Syl hosts the Graphics conference every Sunday in
the *StarShip* conferencing area.

@Node Nick "About Nick Cook"

NICK COOK uses his Amigas to handle tasks from the mundane of word
processing and spreadsheets, to the creative tasks of creating
visuals for presentations to educational and professional groups. He
is the newsletter editor for Amiga Friends Users Group of Huntington
Beach, CA. Nick enjoys using CanDo and AMOS to create utilities and
educational programs for the Amiga. In his spare time, he vaccuums
cat hair out of the keyboard.

@node Dennis "About Dennis Schaefer"

Dennis is 39 years old and live in Los Angeles with a beautiful,
talented and sarcastic clothing designer to whom he has been married
for thirteen years. He works as a videotape editor and occasional
writer-producer at NBC Network Promotion. When not messing around
with rendering 3-d objects he can be found indulging his guilty
pleasure: Air Warrior on GEnie. His first animation was selected for
AmigaWorld's "Amigamations" tape this year (the hummingbird!)

His one regret?  That he missed the ILM and Newtek parties at SIGGRAPH.
Dennis was overheard saying "Michelle Pfeiffer never calls anymore now
that she's famous."

@node joel "About Joe Luk"

Joseph Luk is a full-time student, currently enjoying summer vacation.  He
started programming Commodore 64s early, and remembers making short work of 4th
grade multiplication tables by having a program spit them out for him.  In 1987
he finally managed to convince his parents to get him an Amiga 2000.  Nowadays
he programs in C on an accelerated A1200, in the spare time between the more
mundane activities of student life.  Also an active "telecommunicator", he
says writing for ViewPort is "like posting on a BBS, only it pays a lot better".

@Node nprince "About Nancy Prince"

Nancy Prince spends her time in Vallejo, California, doing the things

those kinds of things!  Nancy operates Prince Graphics when she's not
busy placing Irving Gould in ticklish situations.

@node peterj "About Peter Jacobsen"

Peter majored in Biochemistry, Physics, German and Math at Southwest ST.
Univesity (MN).  While there back in the late 60's, he was introduced to
his first 'computer'.  It was a Wang 'calculator' which operated with
punchcards. He had the 'pleasure' of programming it by punching all those
darn cards! After college, while looking for meaningful work, he heard
about the KIM I. And bought one!  He put it together and it still works to
this day!

Since that time, he has had just about every computer that Commodore put
out (except for the C-16, Plus 4, Amiga 1200, 3000, and 4000.)

Presently employed at NCR/AT&T as a Senior Electronic Computer Tech, Peter
is likes to spend his time at home in front of one of his computers doing
programming, or telecommunicating. He's been a sysop for about 11 years.
Currently he is an assistant SysOp in the CP/M RT on GEnie and hosts the
*StarShip* HelpDesk on Tuesday and Sunday nights.

@node chrisp "About Chris Papademetrious"

Very little is known about the infamous ChrisP, except for the fact that
he's currently a student at some prestigious University, the name of
which escapes us, and that he graduated High School with 14,908,554
honors - a record!

Chris - known as "Wunderkind" to some, but just "Hey, You!" to the rest
of the *StarShip* Staff, is proficient in C, Assembly Language, and the
finer art of Selling Computers.  When he's not cruising the *StarShip*,
he's... he's... Well, really, there are SOME things you just don't want
to know.  Some day we'll tell you why he's listed as "Ensign" on the
*StarShip* Staff Roster....

@node docs "Read Me First!"

First off, you'll need Commodore's AmigaGuide program, but there's not
much chance that you're reading this if you don't have it!  If you want
to take advantages of the "special" features in this issue, however,
you'll need to have the program WDisplay, and you'll need the VPXTRA
file for August.

Due to popular demand, ViewPort.guide expects to find graphics in the SAME
directory from which it was run.  For example, if you keep ViewPort in
your Stuff: directory, make sure the files in the VPXTRA archive go there
as well!

@EndNode

@node info "About This Issue"

We're still tweaking the AmigaGuide format and looking for satisfactory
solutions to some of the stickier problems.  You'll find that we still
use WDisplay, despite the fact that it is limited to the Workbench
palette.  For this issue, it's less of a problem, since the graphics
aren't as involved as they were last time.

We plan to stick to our schedule of releasing on or around the 15th for
the time being.  Next month brings with it WoCA in Pasadena, an event we
plan to attend.  Naturally, you'll want news of that gala bash as soon
as it happens, and we plan to give you just that.

We look forward to the feedback we get from you each month.  Please feel
free to give us your views in the ViewPort topic in the *StarShip* RT, or
via GEnie mail or Internet mail.  And, as always, we thank you for your
support!
