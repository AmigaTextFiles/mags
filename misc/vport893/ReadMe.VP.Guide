@node Main "About *StarShip* Viewport"

 Welcome to the AmigaGuide version of ViewPort!  You'll need a viewer
 capable of understanding AmigaGuide files if you want to view this file
 correctly.  We recommend AmigaGuide, of course.  You'll find the complete
 AmigaGuide kit, including versions for 1.3, 2.x, and 3.x, in the GEnie
 *StarShip* library:

 File #19287 AMIGAGUIDE_V344.LHA  269,056 bytes

 It's a big file, but you only need to get it once.  (Commodore requires
 that the entire archive be kept intact.  This file includes the program,
 documentation, source code, examples, and utilities.)

 You MUST have Workbench 1.3 or greater to use AmigaGuide.

 The text in this archive will be readable through normal means, but it
 will be cluttered with AmigaGuide commands.  If you don't have an
 AmigaGuide-compatible viewer and don't plan to get one, you'll find the
 "normal" version of ViewPort much better suited to your purposes.

 NOTE:  The icon supplied with this archive is set to call AmigaGuide in
 SYS:UTILITIES.  If you have installed AmigaGuide elsewhere, you will need
 to change the path in the default tool.

 This issue of ViewPort has a companion file: VPXTRA_AUG93.  That file
contains the graphics called by certain buttons within ViewPort, and must
be downloaded separately.  If you don't have the graphics, WDisplay will
open an empty window which you can then close.  (If you don't have
WDisplay, you'll simply see an error message.)

  Feel free to reprint and/or repost ViewPort as long as you do so in its
  entirety.

 If you do reprint ViewPort, please drop me a line.  We'd like to know who
 you are, and - if possible - we'd like to see your newsletter, too.
 We're also interested in submissions and feedback.  Again, drop me a line
 on GEnie.  My mail address is JIM.MEYER, or I can be reached at this
 Internet address: jimm@sii.com.
