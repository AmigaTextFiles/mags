Editor's Corner             by @{"Lori Vinciguerra" link P6}

Well, it's summer now!  All of you educators are probably going to start
planning courses and projects for the fall semester soon.  While you are
relaxing and planning, try to check out at least one of the Amiga shows
which are happening in Canada this summer. You can get full descriptions
and information in the "New Products and Exciting News" section of this
issue. Things on the development front seemed to be a little slow during
the Commodore liquidation.  Now that the new Amiga Technologies section
of ESCOM is beginning to get into gear, I'm anticipating product
development to pick up.  If any of you are writing educational products
and want them announced in this newsletter, just send me a note.  I
always check the newsgroup comp.sys.amiga.announce to see if there's
anything of interest.

As for ESCOM, there have been some very positive statements made about
the Amiga's future.  I am confident that our platform will be around for
a long time and that the user base will grow.  I am very anxious to see
what will happen in the educational market.  At least the Amiga is a
viable contender again.  As you plan your fall projects be sure to slip
an Amiga demo in somewhere.  There is a lot of free software on Aminet
to do cool things in all areas of education.  Be sure to check out
Ralph's article on using the Internet and the World Wide Web to find
what you are looking for.

Thanks to Jason Compton for printing my article on "Advice for ESCOM
in the Educational Market" in an issue of Amiga Report.  I received
a lot of email from all of the world telling me about schools which
are using our favorite machine.  I also received some interesting
stories about what they are being used for.  I hope to be able to
include these stories and more in a future issue.

The deadline for article submissions for the October issue is September
15, 1995.  If any of your students are interested in writing an
article, please pass on this information.  As always, email your
article to owl@davinci.reading.ma.us or use U.S. mail to send to OWL
Software, 460 Summer Ave., Reading, MA 01867-3819.  Have a great summer!

      actually will support it well, we want to help them out in any way we
      can.  We also want to get a lot of people together to have a really
      cool time!

GfxBase Eletronic:  A local computer store chain.

Amiga Link:  The online Amiga magazine!


COST FOR RENTING TABLES : $100 - 1 day,  $150 - 2 days, for one table of
                          6' by 3' and chairs.
                          You may do whatever you want to at the rented
                          tables.  These tables are aimed towards dealers
                          and developers.

FREE TABLES:  We will also have free tables at AC'95, for anyone who wishes
              to bring their Amiga, whether to show off something cool, or
              just to help someone else who might need one at the time.
              However, at the free tables you get less space than the pay
              tables, it is first-come first-serve, and you cannot sell
              products at the tables!  That is strictly for the rented
              tables.


ACCESABILITY:  The show is easily accesable by bus and train, as well as
               having lots of parking space in the vicinity for cars.

WHY DEALERS SHOULD COME:  At AC'95, we offer tables at an incredibly cheap
                          price, a price which includes electrical outlets.
                          You also get the chance to show and sell your
                          wares to a crowd of Amiga owners, all of whom
                          have money to spend and are influenced by how big
                          a prescence you have at the show.

WHY PEOPLE SHOULD COME:   AC'95 will have stands from many major dealers
                          and developers.  It will also have a lot of
                          friendly Amiga owners there, plus a booming sound
                          system and TV setup that will show crazy demos
                          and products.  It will be a wild good time for
                          all!

  well as for the BUS terminals of VOYAGEUR, GREYHOUND, etc.

News on the Internet and WWW for Amigans         by @{"Ralph Vinciguerra" link P8}


The World Wide Web (WWW) continues to demonstrate its excellent potential
for use in education. A growing number of sites with educational information
are making the use of a connection to the web more enlightening every day. A
good example is the new central web entry point for NASA (the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space and Administration), "http://www.nasa.gov/". From this
entry point one can obtain information on current and upcoming missions as
well as general NASA information.

There continue to be two main Amiga entry points on the World Wide Web which
index Amiga resources: The Amiga Home Page and The Amiga Web Directory. The
Amiga Home Page has recently moved to a new URL:
"http://www.omnipresence.com/Amiga/". The Amiga Web page remains at the URL
"http://www.prairienet.org/community/clubs/cucug/amiga.html".

A new AmiNet mirror is online at this URL: "http://www.netnet.net/aminet/"
It is also accessible by ftp to "ftp.netnet.com". This helps make up for the
recent disappearance of the Amiga section of the www.cdrom.com AmiNet
mirror. Since it's new, its response time is quite good for people in North
America.

A new Amiga online magazine: Amiga Link is available at this URL:
"http://www.omnipresence.com/Amiga/News/ALink/", joining numerous other
Amiga online journals including Amiga Report, and Amiga Report Tech
Magazine.

The software for connecting our Amigas to the WWW continues to improve.
Currently at OWL we are using a combination of AmiTCP4.0, PPPV1.30
registered, and ALynx1.11. This combination allows text-mode WWW traversal
with the ability to display sound and image links by launching additional
programs, once we dialup to an internet service provider. Most pieces you'll
need can be downloaded from AmiNet. AmiTCP and PPP are somewhat challenging
to install, and require detailed information from your internet provider
along with careful attention to their installation instructions. Perhaps at
some point we'll have an Amiga WWW Kit which has all the needed pieces
together with a good installer script.

Alynx is currently up to version 1.24 and can be found at this URL:
"http://www.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/amiga/alynx.html".

We currently do not use the other popular Amiga Web browser, AMosaic, since
it does not run well on our networked A2000 with AmigaDOS 2.04 and does not
support Web forms. Web forms allow providers to create interactive fill-in
forms through the Web browsers. ALynx does support forms in acceptable
manner, however, things are looking up for AMosaic, as the new beta version
is undergoing testing now, and supports forms along with a more robust
implementation. Very nice work by a dedicated group of volunteer Amiga
developers! We expect to purchase AmigaDOS 3.1 (3.2?) from Amiga
Technologies as soon as possible in order to support this new version. The
URL for AMosaic is "http://www.omnipresence.com/amosaic/2.0/".

Good luck in your net surfing!
