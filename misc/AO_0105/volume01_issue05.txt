AmigaOS 3.5 ships !!
-----

I know this comes as no surprise to most, but Amiga OS 3.5 shipped
on Monday, October 18th, 1999.  As far as we can remember, 3.5 is 
the first new Official Amiga product (socks not included) since the
demise of Commodore in 1994.  Amiga claims that OS 3.5 shipped "as 
promised" and we at Amiga.org would like to applaud, and thank them
for keeping that promise (albeit several months behind the initial 
release date :) ).  

Changes include (as I'm told), an integrated IP stack, an 
integrated browser, much better preferences, and a much needed 
refinement to the look and feel of the GUI.  Most people might
argue that they've accomplished the same changes on their own, but
in our minds here at AO, there's a LOT to be said for running
official versions of the OS with officially supported utilities
versus the time-honored Amiga tradition of "patching" it all 
together and making it work..

I've got my 3.5 CD coming in the mail, and I'd heartily reccommend
that you contact your favorite Amiga vendor to obtain a copy.  If 
you don't have a favorite vendor, just ask, and I'll let you use 
mine...

Screenshots of the new OS are available at

AOL...  Gateway...  800 Million Dollars... - What does all it mean?
-----

On Thursday, we learned that AOL is joining forces with Gateway to
develop what they're calling "Internet Appliances".  The figure 
being bandied about is $800 million dollars, which means that both
AOL and Gateway are taking this very, very seriously.

Does the Amiga enter into this equation?  Who knows?  Amiga isn't
saying, but the smart money is betting that Gateway is the first
"licensee" of the Amiga technology.  While they may not be 
building a full-blown MCC computer (we don't know that for sure),
every indication tells us Gateway will have a really cool surprise 
for us in the near future.

Amiga.org server problems
-----

Over the last week, particularly between the hours of 10:15am and 
1:00pm Eastern time US, many of you have noticed problems with our
news feed and site both bogging down and giving server errors.

This is a problem, because our ISP's (Hiway.com) server is 
completely overloaded with lunchtime surfers.  I have been working 
with several other ISP engineers from major providers and we have 
taken the time and effort to spell out to Hiway EXACTLY how to 
correct the problem and they refuse to implement the simple fix.

Instead, they insist that if we want to fix the problem, we have to
move to a dedicated or co-located server (+ $$$$) to get the problem 
fixed.  Needless to say right now that this simply is not an option 
for us due to budgetary constraints.  In other words, Amiga.org is 
falling victim to not only a mediocre nickel and dime ISP, but our 
own growing success.

For those of you inconvenienced by this, we sincerely apologize.
We're looking for an alternative right now considering that our
contract for services is ending in April 2000.


-----
Amiga.org now speaks 6 different languages
-----

Yes, I know there's a news link to this same story below, and this
is a bit redundant, but in my humble opinion, the fact that we can
now offer on-the-fly translations of Amiga.org into six different
languages is absolutely cool.  No, we didn't invent it.  No, we're
not the first to use it, and No, it's not perfect translation.  In 
truth, it's the same engine which drives Altavista's 'Babelfish' 
site without the 40k limit we've had to live with from the 
Babelfish service (on the main news page)

We hope you enjoy it.

[soapbox] Getting the word out. [/soapbox]
-----

Let's face it, the Amiga commercial (and even shareware) market
isn't what it used to be.  As Amiga users, if we're brutally 
honest with ourselves, we have to openly understand and accept 
that developers and dealers can no longer stay Amiga-only in order
to survive.  

Over the last several months of running Amiga.org, we've noticed
a trend though that, if corrected, will help dealers and developers
alike with little and/or no money involved.  

Quite tactlessly stated, most Amiga developers and dealers have 
become their worst marketing nightmare.  While there are exceptions
(Nova Design, National Amiga, and AmigaOnline.net come to mind),
most Amiga developers have yet to figure out how absolutely
powerful the Internet can be.

Most developers that I talk to make one fatally incorrect 
assumption.  Time and time again, they tell me "I'll just write 
my app, then post a note on my site.  People will find it."  While 
my responses to this tactic may vary, let me summarize them with a 
resounding "WRONG!!!!!!!!!"  

Neither dealers, nor developers can afford the assumption that 
users care enough to search hundreds of websites per week looking
for news, updates, and the likes.  Though rather self-serving, 
that's why Amiga.org exists.  Not only Amiga.org, but roughly
30 other sites (including amiga-news.de, Czech Amiga News, and the
AWD) which specialize in posting Amiga news and happenings to help 
get the word out.  There are also print magazines who are 
absolutely scrambling for news.  Send any news to those sites.  
Use our pre-built form at http://amiga.org/feedback/submitnews.shtml.
Allegiance to a site doesn't matter. In this market, getting the 
word out is the only thing that matters.  With the way the Amiga 
web community is performing, if you get your news item on one 
site, it'll filter to 50 within three days.  Two sites, 1 day.  
Three sites, within hours.

Users:  If you have a favorite programmer or dealer who isn't
bothering to broadcast their news and items, ask them "why not?"
Badger them, harrass them, make them help themselves. :)
If they still fail to understand, help them out and send news 
for them.  That would help the community immensely.

That being said, let me admit that the online portion of Amiga 
users is still a pitifully small percentage of the total estimated
user base (online Amigas have been previously estimated at 5 - 10%
of the total user base).  What I'm babbling about here will not 
provide a miracle cure to our ailing marketplace.  It will help 
get your product/service noticed.  When people notice your product,
people buy your product.  As a developer / dealer, it is YOUR 
responsibility to get the word out about your product, it is NOT
the world's responsibility to find it.

See you next Friday,

Wayne Hunt
Site Manager

whatever technology Amiga is developing, surmised Richard Doherty, 
president of consulting firm Envisioneering Group.
