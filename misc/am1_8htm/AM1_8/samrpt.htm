<P ALIGN="LEFT">As Senior Editor of The Amiga Monitor, I have this space reserved for my monthly musings about the status of our old friend, the Ami machine. I usually try to be thoughtful and reserved in my meanderings, even optimistic on occasion. However.....here on the Ides of March......a month and a half after the deadline for bids, I must confess to having serious reservations regarding the outcome of whatever it is that was going on in Germany. Therefore I will reserve further comment on the subject until next month.</P>
