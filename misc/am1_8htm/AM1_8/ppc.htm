<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Phase 5 Press Release</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Oberursel, February 25, 1997:</B> phase 5 digital products is proud to announce
the upcoming CYBERSTORM PPC PowerPC-based accelerators for Amiga 3000(T)
and 4000(T) as well as systems with compatible CPU-slot. With these innovative
and powerful new accelerators a new dimension of performance is brought
to the Amiga, with performance increases of 10 times and more compared to
the fastest 68k based accelerators available today, resulting in a breath-taking
performance. <BR>
<BR>
Primarily being designed as an upgrade board for existing Amiga systems,
the CYBERSTORM PPC incorporates phase 5's innovative dual-processor technologie,
where a fast PowerPC RISC processor is combined with a 68k processor, in
case of the CYBERSTORM PPC either a 68040 or a 68060 CPU. Both CPUs dynamically
share the memory and system busses, what is necessary for a true multiprocessor
behaviour. While the original AmigaOS 3.x continues to run on the 68k CPU
- as well as all existing applications do, what provides 100% compatibility
- the PowerPC CPU is supported by a comprehensive PPC Library developed
by phase 5, which provides all functionality to integrate the PowerPC into
the Amiga multitasking environment. Software developers can easily optimze
their programs step by step by porting single tasks to PowerPC code, which
then can run parallel with 68k tasks. Many important Amiga software vendors
are preparing ported versions of their software packages already, so it
is expected that a large quantity of software products supporting the PowerPC
will be available soon.<BR>
<BR>
The CYBERSTORM PPC will initially be availabe with the fast PowerPC 604e
processor in clock speeds of 150, 180 and 200 MHz; the socket for the 68k
companion processor accepts either a 68040 or a 68060 CPU. It provides a
64-bit wide, extremely fast memory expansion option (which can be upgraded
by using pairs of standard PS/2 type SIMMs) which is dynamically shared
by the two CPUs. Additionally, the CYBERSTORM PPC comes along with a DMA-driven
Wide ULTRA SCSI controller on-board, which allows transfer rates of up to
40MB/s and is ready for the most demanding and professional applications.
A 32-bit high-speed expansion connector with DMA access to the main memory
is also provided for later upgradability. The 200MHz version of the CYBERSTORM
PPC provides - only on the PPC side - a raw performance of more than 350
MIPS or approximately 8.1 SPECint95 and 7.1 SPECfp95 (estimations based
on Motorola/IBM manufacturer specifications) - a blistering performance
that goes far beyond most PC systems available today.<BR>
<BR>
The CYBERSTORM PPC will be delivered with a comprehensive software package,
which includes the PPC library as well as tools for creative users, among
them a Public Domain GNU C compiler for PowerPC (including sourcecode) and
many demo programs and utilities with sourcecode; in addition to this software
free developer support is available via the phase 5 FTP site. Last not least
a PowerPC-optimized version of CyberGraphX V3 with RISC-optimized CyberGL/3D
and MPEG functions and libraries is included - of course with comprehensive
documentation. <BR>
<BR>
The CYBERSTORM PPC will be selling for a very attractive price, offering
a superior price/performance relation. The suggested retail prices are as
follows:<BR>
<UL><B>
CYBERSTORM PPC w/ 150 MHz 604e processor<BR>   
DM 1295,- / GBP  529.00 / USD  698.00<P>
CYBERSTORM PPC w/ 180 MHz 604e processor<BR>
DM 1595,- / GBP  649.00 / USD  879.00<P>
CYBERSTORM PPC w/ 200 MHz 604e processor<BR>
DM 1895,- / GBP  769.00 / USD 1069.00</UL></B>

<BR>
<BR>
Note: All prices are recommended retail prices. English and german price
include local VAT, the recommended US price does not include local taxes.
The prices are without the 68k CPU which is necessary to operate the CYBERSTORM
PPC. 68k processors from existing processor boards can be used on the CYBERSTORM
PPC by pluging these into the provided socket. If you don't own a 68k CPU
already, ask you local dealer for an attractive bundle offer.<BR>
<BR>
Registered owners of a phase 5 68040- or 68060 board will - within the PowerUp
upgrade program - receive special, attractive upgrade offers by mail during
March 97. The handling of these upgrades will be done via local appointed
representatives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the second half of the year, an innovative graphic board will become
available for the CYBERSTORM PPC expansion slot which will provide a functionality
subset of the innovative CAIPIRINHA custom chip. By providing a stand-alone version
of the DLRP (Display List Risc Processor) this board will offer superior display 
funtionality, highest WRAM-based resolution, pixel depth and speed as well as
the possibility to start developing software that will support the functionality
of our upcoming A&#092;BOX computer system (please refer also to the project information about the
A&#092;BOX project in our news section).<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So what does this mean for the Amiga? Is it the beginning of a new road, a renewed vigor for the platform? Time will tell. I, for one, find the possibilities to be fascinating. We can be fairly certain that these new accelerators will offer uncompromising performance; we can only imagine where it may go from here.</P>
