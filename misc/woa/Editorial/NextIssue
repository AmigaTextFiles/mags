Next Issue

Next issue we hope to have more articles since this issue was a rush
release. That means we want articles, tutorials, features and letters
(amongst other things) from you. It's Trogladite Software's 4th
Birthday Special next issue, so you can send something relating to that
if you want to.

It's also Alpha Software's 4th birthday sometime next year and as such
we have a rather large couple of articles from Gareth Murfin, the founder
of Alpha Software.

Along with that, we hope to give you a quite large demo of Cosmo's Fun
Class (EXCLUSIVE!) and some details of how our own projects are getting
on!
