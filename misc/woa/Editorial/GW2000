What Can Be Done???

All these arguments, all the tension, all the frustration and all
for nothing! What is the point in arguing with the Peecee owners
about Amiga's being the better of the two? There isn't one. We
believe that our machine is better (and it is) and they believe
that theirs is better. 

I'm not saying that there's no hope for the amiga bunch and that
Gateway 2000 will not be able to persuade people back to the amiga
market. They probably will be able to, but when the argument's
just between a small group of people, we have no chance what-so-ever
since both parties believe that their own computer is best!

So what can gateway do to get the Amiga back? for a start it needs
to sell some Amigas. Or make some money somehow! Then it can do
a massive British TV campaign. Perhaps it can get on some sort of
show and get a free plug (or maybe some celebrity can get on a
chat show and do it for them!). 

I think that the Printers deal with canon was a good idea. Canon
now are obliged to mention the Amiga in their adverts and produce
drivers for it. I think that films and series' (such as Babylon 5)
should state CLEARLY that they are made with Amigas!

And I also think that EVERYONE who owns an Amiga should write to
Gateway 2000 telling them your Ideas, and EVERYONE who owns an Amiga
should bombard big computer stores who stock computer games (like
Virgin, etc.) and tell them that there are people out there willing
to buy Amiga products if they stock them!

Anyway, they're my ideas. Anyone got any better ones? Send them to:
