Whats On Disk 2?

Theres some nice new stuff I found on Aminet, including a picture of an
A500 Tower, and there's a new Ppaint Rexx script which shows hex colours
instead of decimal when creating web pages in PPaint. There's also
the latest datatypes.

Please email woa@trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk and put 'Disk 2' in the
subject line, if you have any ideas for what we can put on disk 2 or
anything you would like to see there.
