It's Christmas

Since this is our christmas special, we had to include something which
relates to christmas didn't we? Well, in all the haste of trying to
put together a diskmag from what ruins are left of my hard disk, I haven't
had chance to make our Xmas issue very christmassy have I?

Last year I remember writing an article on christmas eve. Once I'd done
that, I went upstairs to my room to watch Naked Gun (can't remember which
one). I was promptly greeted by a power cut and a very annoying attempt
to go to sleep which failed miserably up until about midnight. Then I
got to sleep, only to find, as happens every year, I was awake at 3:45
AM!

I enjoy getting up this early, because I am much more of a night time
person, you see. Anyway, I got up and opened my prezzies and continued
the article telling everyone what I got. This year, I intend to do the
same thing, so here's what I got:

    Zombie Massacre
    Power Typhoon 030
    Queen Calendar
    Queen 'Jazz'
    Queen II
    Roger Taylor, Fun In Space
    CD/Tape/Radio type thingy
    Amiga Mouse
    Amiga Mousemat
    Amiga ClassiX CD

The Amiga stuff is all reviewed this next issue.
