Internet

Welcome to Issue 1's instalment of 'Internet Choice'. This issue
we've been to one of the best Amiga Games Companies sites. 

Vulcan software have had their own site for a while now and I've
never been to visit it until a few weeks ago. It took a while to 
load in because of the masses of pictures it uses as buttons, but
I thought it was worth it.

It's got all sorts of things on there, from solutions to games and
demos of games to news and things that have been going on at Vulcan
lately.

It's a brilliant read so get your web browser out and visit Vulcan
at www.vulcan.co.uk. There's also another site (Don't know if it's
the same) at: www.vul-soft.co.uk
