VULCAN
~~~~~~

A few days ago I recieved an envelope which I opened and found a
nice piece of paper which had a nice blotchy white and light
blue pattern on it. On it was printed the vulcan software
logo. 

	WOA> Where do you get your ideas from?

	VULCAN> imagination! The source for creativity.


	WOA> How do you do the graphics work in games such as hellpigs?

	VULCAN> The graphics in hellpigs are primarily split
	into two areas. The first is the backdrops which are all
	hand drawn to create extrememly detailed locations. The
	characters have all been acted by people and captured on
	video. This video footage is then digitised and cut out
	to create 1,000's of sprite images that, when strung
	together in a game create extrememly realistic character
	movements.

	moment and the best source of info is our website at:
