Loom is by the same people that brought you Monkey Island 
and it is of the same quality gameplay and graphics. It is a brilliant
game. You play the role of Bobbin Threadbare, a person who was born 
into the guild of weavers and as you were born, a shadow came (that's 
a natural disaster to them) and you were put to blame.

They want rid of you but the mighty god type people save you and 
banish them. Then they realise that you werent' the cause and you must
work your way all the way to where-ever they went to. Sounds easy, eh?
Well it's not!

Amongst the puzzles there are things that make you turn sheep GREEN! 
and other such nonesense. However, the puzzles are logical and the 
game is easy to play. You just need one thing, the distaff. This is a 
magical wand type thing that you use to cast things using certain 
notes of the musical scale. 

These should be recorded into the manual on a special page and you can
then use them again. It is very good!
