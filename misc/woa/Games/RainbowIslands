I didn't think this game was much good at all really but you may 
think different. I love games that have you on the edge of your seat, 
but I was falling to bloody sleep over this game.

The graphics are awful , the detail is absolutely crap because 
evrything is too small. The sound isn't too brilliant really either, 
but the music is pretty good.

I wouldn't recommend buying this game because in my opinion, the game 
goes down in score because it is a platform game. All you do is jump 
upwards avoiding water which chases you.

Also, you don't like being allowed three hits before losing a life. 
You get 1 lousy piss effore and then you've lost a bloody life. There 
are 7 islands wit 4 rounds and a boss on each island.

The levels start off easy and get harder every time, but once you've 
played them a few times, the hard ones are piss easy. I have only 
played this for the A500 and do not know if you can get it for the 
rest of the Amiga Computers.

(Yes you can- There is an A1200 Version out now! - Ed)
