ADoom

Doom Port - PD

This port of DOOM from the freely distributable Linux source code
of the game with the Same name for the PC is one of the best if you
have a fast beefy Amiga. If you only have a standard A1200 with
however much memory, you're still gonna struggle! If you have some
form of accellerator, no doubt it will go faster. The reason that
you will have problems is because ADoom has no support for the
Low detail option (well, the version I'm reviewing doesn't anyway)
This may have been added since then but I don't know if it has or
it hasn't. If it has then I assume that people with less beefy
Amigas can play the game at managable speeds.

Don't expect to be able to play ADoom (or any other Doom port) on
an unexpanded A500. While many of the ports currently available
have options to go as low colour as ECS, not many will run at a
reasonable speed, so, either don't play ADoom, or Upgrade...

I would say that the best feature in ADoom and a lot of people
agree with this, is the TCP networking option whereby you can
play against other Amiga users, or even PC users if you have some 
sort of TCP connection (or Ethernet connection). 

Sorry about the score, ADoom has just missed out on a 90%+ score
but that simply because the version I have does not have a
low detail mode. If you have a version of ADoom with Low Detail
mode then you can add another 3 percent onto the score!
