Aladdin

Virgin - Not Hard Disk Installable - 3 Disks

Aladdin is one of the games which I don't like all that much. I
got it for Christmas one year and I played it a few times but then
got bored with it. The reason I got bored with it was simply
because it is boring!

The Lion King also published by Virgin and Disney Software was
a helluva lot better than Aladdin but I only played TLK at someones
house ages ago. The graphics weren't dissimilar and it was a 
normal platform game but Aladdin is just the same all the way
through and far too hard!

The Golden rule of computer games programming is don't make games
take more than a few minutes to master! There are so many things
which you might need to do in the game, you need to know how to use
everything from ropes, to Camels (!)

It is playable, but I don't like it simply because I have to take
ages to get used to it and it's just far too hard.
I'm sure it will appeal to die hard platform fans but I don't
like it very much. I think you figured that out though didn't you? :)

Might seem a but generous to say i hate the game, but I suppose
it's good for some people, just not me!
