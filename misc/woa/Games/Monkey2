Monkey Island 2

Available from Islona Entertainment - 11 Disks - HD Installable

11 Disks for one game seems a tad excessive doesn't it, but you do have
to excuse this since the game is so brilliantly detailed. Lucasarts,
the programmers, no longer support the Amiga which is a great shame
since the PC has now got Monkey Island 3, The Curse of LeChuck, but
let's hope they see the light and come back to the Amiga if only to make
Monkey Island 3 for PPC Amiga's!

Anyway, Monkey Island 2 (Lechucks Revenge) is what I'm supposed to be
talking about, right? So I will. This incarnation of the classic
Lucasarts adventure Monkey Island is by far the best. It features
the original character but now on a new Island named 'Scabb'. 

I don't think that the name is supposed to inspire confidence into
prospective tourists do you? Obviously not. Anyway, you start and
you're sat near a fire talking to these two prats who just sit
there getting drunk all day.

Anyway, the idea is to get rid of this irritating little git who
lives on the Island claiming to be better than everyone else. Anyway,
you get a voodoo doll and drive him off the island before being
befriended by a local mapmaker who gets kidnapped and you follow
him to the newly resurrected Lechuck's manky old fortress from
which you have to rescue your map maker friend.

Then you get blasted to an Island and fall through the ground and
end up with Lechuck who you discover is your brother after all.
As mentioned in the Info panel, you can get Monkey Island 1 and
2 for £24.99 from Islona Entertainment. Call them on (01793) 432176
