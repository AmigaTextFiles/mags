BRIAN THE LION

Pygnosis - No Longer Available? - 3 Disks - HD Instalable

Brian the Lion has been rated badly by Amiga Format (the CD³² version
was anyway). I don't know whether this has anything to do with the
CD³²'s inferior control system or what, because AF gave Theme Park
CC³² a lower mark than the Mouse controlled equivalent.

Anyway, Brian The Lion is a good game, whatever  Amiga Format thinks.
I think it's pretty good. Basically, the whole plot revolves around        
you being a lion (surprisingly, called Brian) and you must wander 
around a lot of levels and free a speaking crystal called Chris.

How amusing you may think to yourself sarcastically. However bad
the plot may be the gameplay makes up for this. It is all very
easy to control. You use the directions on the joystick and Brian
will go that way (duh).  Press fire and he will thrust his claw out
hoping to scratch someones stomach open if there's anyone there :)

Not that you get to see any blood and guts or anything, it's just
really a run of the mill platformer which is playable and enjoyable
for a time.

Those of you who like to be on the edge of your seat with action
and tension may not like the game although some of the time, precise
timing is necessary and tension is inevtiable!
