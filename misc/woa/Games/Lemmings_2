Lemmings 2

There has always been some amount of misconception between the names
of Lemmings 2 and 'The Tribes'. They are not, as a lot of people
think, different, but are the same game it's just that Lemmings 2
is the name, The Tribes is the title. Lemmings 2 - The Tribes.

As the name suggests, the game is Lemmings, but it includes tribes
of the little green haired creatures. Theres the Sports tribe, and
the Beach tribe and another 10. Each of these tribes gets 60 lemmings
and you basically go into their territory and try to get the the
end of it where you will be put on a ship ready to leave the island.
Once all the tribes have done that (at least one lemming from each
tribe) then the ship goes off and you end up somewhere else.

But alas, some of the tribes seem to think it's amusing to die on
the way leaving you with only 3 tribes in Lemmings 3 which is
somewhat annoying. But still, who cares? :)
