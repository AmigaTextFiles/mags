This is a bloody tremendous game. It is just Theme Park but you put 
things on the beach and on the Prom. And instead of getting rides, 
you get things like Water Skiing hires and Scuba Diving and 
Paragliding etc etc. 

You also get to put theatre shows on and concerts and bingo. You 
advertise tham so people will come to the shows. The Graphics are of 
a very high standard and well deatiled. And as for the sound, it's 
excellent and really clear to hear and understand.

I think that this is the best Amiga game  going and you can get it for
all Amigas. After about 5 minutes, you are totally addicted and 
can't get off it.

I think you should definately get this game and it is the highest 
rated game this issue. I honestly think this should be awarded game 
of the year award. It's getting a gold award!
