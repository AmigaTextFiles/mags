Flight of the amazon
Queen. What a tongue
twister. We prefer
to call it...

FOTAQ

This is a graphic adventure on the mould of monkey island. Sort of the
same, but has little undistinguishable Icons instead of verbs that you
use to tell your character what to do.

I have noticed a slight niggle in our games editor about Graphic
adventure games...

	"They are all CRAP!"

he said. This is because he doesn't yet understand the fundamentals
of computer data storage...

	"Why can't they put it all on one disk?"

He asks about monkey island 2! This is now why he won't play a graphic
adventure game again. To top it all, he was playing on an A500+ with
2MB of memory.

And this has 11 disks too. Oh no, not compressed on to one disk, but
it does have 11 disks.

It's about a dood called Joe King (Ha HA! Joe-king, Jo-king, Joking!)
who goes around trying to take this famous (I've never heard of her)
actress called faye russel to somewhere.

He goes about it crap, and ends up in the drink. He has to get to
shore, escape and find's a secret base of operations for a leather
company who plan to take over the world!

Simple enough Eh?

This disks going to be full soon.
