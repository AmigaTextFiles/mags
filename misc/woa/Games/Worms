WORMS
~~~~~

Worms is a completely excellent game. It is a shootemup with a 
difference. You are a team of worms fighting another team of
Worms. 

Anyway, you get a choice of a lot of weapons such as bazooka's
and miniguns and Sheep and things and your aim is to blow up
the opposing team.

May seem easy, and it is, fairly, although computer teams tend
to be able to use the wind speed and direction exactly so they
hit you pixel perfectly, I've never had their 'luck'.
But, of course, there would have to be more features than this.
Well, yes there is. For instance, there are over 4 !!BILLION!!
different levels for you to play on.

And there is a very strange part to that, because everyone says
that they are randomly generated. But I find that if you actually
enter the number of a level by pressing Right mousebutton when
the level is being made, you will get the same level if you
enter the same number at a later date. I find this immensly 
useful because when you find a really cool level, just write it's
number down and use it over and over again. I find if you enter
'Zipstick' and 'Advance' you get quite good levels.

Which brings me onto another point. How the hell do these people
store over 4000000000 levels on 3 disks? They must have done
somehow because you can use the same one's over and over, and
they aren't different on each persons machine so they aren't
random because if you got the issue of Amiga Format with the
Worms review in it, they at the top of the page you would see
a screenshot of an entire Desert landscape saying this is someones
fave level. It says it's called 'Ayrshire', and If I type
that in, the same level appears on my screen!!!

Enough about levels eh? Actually, no. more level talk. You can
add to the 4 billion levels currently available by making your
own custom levels using Dpaint or something. So really, you're
not going to get through all of the levels in a hurry are you?
