UFO Enemy Unclothed

This is a good game in some ways but in others its a load of KAK.
Its just a queer game where you go round trying to cover up flashers
You own a base called X pants which you can build up to be really good.You
get things like radar systems,staff toilets,sewing machines to make clothes
for the strippers,design studios to design things (obviously),gynasiums to,
to train your soldiers and a load of other things that i cant be bothered 
telling you about.You go around in this little attempt for a van and try to 
catch strippers.You have to hit your van into theirs so it will break down.
When it has broken down you have to go on a mission to try to put clothing on
the strippers,if you complete your mission then you get to take strippers    
and do research on them.

Anyway thats enough about the game play,onto the marks.I thought the graphics
were o.k but they were nothing perticulary special.I would give them a 
genorous 6 out of 10.As for the sound, there isnt really much to hear, but 
what you do hear is quite good.I would sound a 6 out of 10 also.The gameplay
is good but if you go on a mission they seem to drag on foreverI would give
gameplay a genorous 7 out of 10.My over all mark for U.F.O ENEMY UNCLOTHED
is an 8 out of 10.I would advise you to try this game but if you dont have
the patience, then this isn't the game for you.
