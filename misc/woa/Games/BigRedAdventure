The Big Red adventure is about 3 rather weird people with rather
strange senses of humour. The first one you meet is appropriately
called 'Doug'. He is the main character in part 1. In part two
we meet someone called Dino. Hmm. Lastly in part 3 we meet Donna
who seems to wear a lot of revealing clothing, and indeed at
times, nothing at all!

Ok, I've stopped trying to think of witty things to say about her
now because my brain has stopped working. 

Anyway, The control method is very fiddly and annoying at times,
because even though it is running from CD, there are long pauses
while it loads stuff in. This is even more annoying because, when
the bad control system kicks in, you end up going places you didn't want
to go and then having to go back again which takes up ages!

Why can't they make adventure games with logical puzzles anymore?
It really does get frustrating, so much so that I often skip parts 
one and two to start in part 3 so I can just get to the end, pretend
I've played it all the way through and never bother with it again and
give it away to a charity vets fund or something.

However, the game is very good and although I've been moaning and
groaning up above about it being complete crap, it isn't really, but
I'm just in a bad mood. There are extremely good parts to the game
but none I can think of just at the moment. But the control system
does let it down a lot. sorry Power computing!
