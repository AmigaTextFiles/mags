Globdule

Pygnosis - No Longer Available - 2 Disks - Not HD Installable

Globdule is the type of game with the graphics that make you go
'Awwwww'. This funny little purple blob who's main aim in life
is to get in amongst the other toys in the toy shop (i think).
To do this, you have to battle your way past various nasties
(like you do in all platform games :) and eventually complete
all the levels which I don't think is possible.

It's not that there are quadlioquillions (yes, I made that up :)
of levels, it's just that they are very hard. This is not really
a bad point in the game since it gives more chance to explore
the levels thoroughly and get to know them because you always
keep coming back to them after dying!

I'm trying not to sound annoyed here, but It's quite hard since
the game doesn't really give you much of a chance. A few lives and
you're out of there! No continues or anything and not many extra
lives available.

Now, If I knew some cheats, then I would give the game a more
favourable review (which isn't a bad idea. I'm just off to look for
some cheats). But it's still fun enjoying the first set of levels
so I'll be generous with the scoring.
