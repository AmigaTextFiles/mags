I Did find some cheats for the game! Here they are:

When playing, press down CTRL, Left SHIFT, Left ALT and Right ALT.
Now you can press one of the following keys:

	F3 ............................ Open Exits
	F4 ........................ Complete Level
	F9 ......................... Restart Level
	CTRL ....................... Invincibility
	
Also, if you press DEL in the map screen, you can go anywhere on the
map. This works for the level map screen too!
