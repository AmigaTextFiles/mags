Magnetic Fiction

Magnetic Fiction is a sort of Diskmag but with one big difference. It
contains a load of stories instead of articles. These stories range
from Thriller To Horror and most of them are brilliant!

The stories are mostly written by the author of the package while
a few are written by other people. The whole package has been 
voluntarily labelled a 15 because of strong language in some of
the stories, but as the author quite rightly points out, the
language is "an essential part of the writers ability to create
realism". All the stories have the feeling of reading actual proper 
books since the standard and style which the stories are written in 
match that of proper 'novels'

If you're looking for something to read, either becuase you've been
through your local library 14 times already, or just because you're
after a good read which Magnetic Fiction can supply, then you really
ought to check this out.
