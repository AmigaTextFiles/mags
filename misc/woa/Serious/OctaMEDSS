OctaMED Soundstudio

OctaMED has got to be the most popular Amiga Music program ever made.
It started out life as a small proggy called MED which started off
the trend and created OctaMED from version 1 to 6 and now we're
starting a whole new version, OctaMED Soundstudio.

Noone knows what MED stands for, If indeed, it stands for anything,
but I don't really suppose anyone cares either. The fact still
remians, despite what MED is an acronym for, that it is capable of
creating some stunning results.

Don't believe me? Just go and look on Aminet (mods/med) and you'll
see what I mean. All the other music making programs I know of
which can create things like Taketracker and Screamtracker are usually
PD, and as good as they might be, why not just use onee or two
different muic file formats because as far as I can see Take and
Scream tracker have no advantages over MED or even good ol' Protracker!

94% (You see, it's an improvment on OctaMED 6).
