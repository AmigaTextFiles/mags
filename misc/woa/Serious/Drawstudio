Drawstudio

Drawstudio is an absolutely excellent piece of software. If you're
even vaguely interested in DTP or structured graphics work then
this is the first thing you should get. It has loads of features
whereby you can add Gradients, textures, use various fonts which
come with the program etc.

There are lots of attributes for every object which you get to
alter to suit your needs such as line thickness, Line style, 
end of line style (arrowheads etc.) Line colour, Font size, 
and loads of things. You can have things like Bitmap fills inside
objects and save your work as either structured or bitmmap
graphics which makes it one hell of a paint program as well
as being the top structured program!

Like I said, if you're remotely into graphics then get this
product.
