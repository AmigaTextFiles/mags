IDEFix-97

Idefix is a disk full of excellent things which will allow you to use
an IDE/ATAPI type device to the max. Here's a review of everything
that comes on the disk (which I can use).

PlayCD
~~~~~~
This has to be my second most used program. It basically lets you
play music CD's with your IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM. It does its job very
well and has loads of options for programming how the tracks will 
play back and stuff like that.

9/10


CD³² Support (Don't know the real name)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now you too can play CD³² Games with your normal IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM.
I haven't had chance to test it but I suppose it works properly or
they wouldn't include it would they?

FindDevice
~~~~~~~~~~
This one will use the device drivers which are installed when you
install IDEFix and tell you any devices it finds using the devdrivers.
Then you can see what unit number your add on devices are and it
will let you do stuff to them (when installing, it will select the
appropriate device).

9/10

KillDev
~~~~~~~
This will get rid of the device which you set up at the beginning
when you installed Idefix.

9/10

I don't use the other pieces of software (and can't get them working
anyway) so I can't really review them, but based on the programs
I have reviewed, Idefix gets a nice:
