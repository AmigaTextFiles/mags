IntOS

AMOS is a brilliant programming language which I have given the best
score ever in WOA! This is an add on for it which consists of several
procedures which you load into your program and use them. It adds 
intuition support to AMOS and allows you to do things which you would
normally not be able to do in AMOS such as open Intuition screens and
windows etc.

It's actually a very good piece of software to say that it doesn't
make use of the AMOS facility to add assembler coded extensions and
opts to use the procedures which you could alter if you have a better
way of doing something.

This makes intOS something which you can't really afford to miss if
you enjoy programming in AMOS and want to create your own intuition
programs. The manual leaves a lot to be desired and there are loads
of spelling mistakes in it but you generally know what's being talked
about in it.

Overall Score: 86%
