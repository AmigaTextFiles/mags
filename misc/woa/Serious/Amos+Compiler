AMOS Professional V2.0

I've just got AMOS professinal V2 after buying the AMOS pro compiler
which actually updates AMOS pro for you (to v2). AMOS is and always
has been one of the best BASIC languages for the Amiga and while I
understand people might want to use Blitz more than they do AMOS now,
I am not one of those people simply because Blitz does not have the
same user friendliness as AMOS. Now if the people who make blitz could
add a half decent text editor (one that lets you delete whole lines
using either ALT and DEL or CTRL and DEL) then I might actually
use it.

AMOS has about 750 commands (I think) and can have more added by
people who can program in assembler ans stuff like that. This means that
even if AMOS doesn't have a built in feature to do something, someone
somewhere might have the knowhow to make that feature in AMOS a
reality!

The programmer of AMOS has written some nifty little utilities in
AMOS aswell which will help you create your program in AMOS such as
a bob creator, a resource bank creator, sound bank creators etc.

There are commands for doing all sorts of things such as priting to
the screen and printer, to calling DOS functions and things to do
with library vector offsets! I do have Blitz Basic and after using
it a few times and finding that the Mousewait command decided it
wouldn't work, I gave up and came straight back to AMOS.

Either way AMOS is better (In my opinion): 98% (That goes for the
compiler too!)
