Eyetech CD-Plus!

Last year, I got the Eyetech CDPlus drive. It came with a disk which
contained a CD Filesystem which you had to then install (if you didn't
already have the Commodore CDFS which I don't). After installing the
disk I found that it was a demo version which I thought was a bit
naughty.

Not that it really mattered because I only had a few CD titles then
and didn't use it excessively. However, when I got some more CD's
I wanted to use it more ofter. The CDFS was not disabled in any way
but a message did pop up every so often which. This happened 3 times
and then the CD ROM didn't work until your rebooted.

This was pretty annoying until I upgraded to IDEFix-97. Anyway you
will need a cable coming out of the side of your machine. This will
be connected to a small card with 4 plugs on it meaning you can connect
this to your IDE prot and then you can add 4 more IDE devices!!!

Overall, It's a brilliant piece of equipment and it's fairly cheap
too.
