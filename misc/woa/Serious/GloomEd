GloomEd

GloomEd is the program you need if you have Gloom 1 (or Gloom 3 for
that matter). It lets you make your own levels for Gloom which you
can then spread around. Weird thing is, since Gloom is supposed to
be so popular, where are all the Gloom PD Levels? Write to me if you
have created any and we'll set up a library of peoples Gloom Levels
and release them to Aminet (maybe) aswell!

Anyway, Gloomed lets you add all those things you see in Gloom 1
such as Rotating walls and to quote the readme file 'Pulsating
Freekazoids' :)

It's the only program which can make Gloom levels and let you
incorporate your own textures for walls and ceilings and even comes
with a small utility to create your own monsters which you can then
use in your levels.
