TECHNICAL THINGS

This issues technical things will be taking a look at the strange
world of the Amiga ports.

We will be looking at the A1200 (which could also apply to the
A600 and later machines such as A4000). Not new machines such
as the Infinitv A1500 etc.

JOYSTICK/MOUSE PORT

These are generally used to connect Joysticks and mice to. A while
ago a card reader (for bank cards etc.) was sold by Datel Electronics.
These also used the Joystick port.

DISKDRIVE PORT

Used to attack another disk drive to your machine. Then on the back
of this other drive, you could attach another drive and another
to the back of that and another to the back of that giving the
posibility of DF0, DF1, DF2 and DF3! I don't think the Amiga, by
default can address more than 4 disk drives (including internal one).

SERIAL PORT

Used to connect things like Serial Printers (Old) and Null Modem
cables. Modems are also attached to the Serial Port.

PARALLEL PORT

Used to connect Sound Samplers and modern printers.

AUDIO PORTS

These alow you to use Phono leads and connect your Amiga to various
sound outpur devices such as speakers or the AUX input on your
stereo which sounds very good.

VIDEO

You can attach a monitor to this. I'm not sure about what else you
can add here.

COMP(OSITE)

You can connect this to a TV. I don't know what use it is.

MODULATOR

You can connect this to a TV too. This is the most used thing for
connecting a TV to your Amiga instead of a monitor. You can actually
have a monitor and a TV connected at the same time.

POWER

Connect the Power supply to here. Duh :)
