Amorphous

At Amorphous, we wanted our first game to Space Wars:Pioneers, a space 
exploration, combat, stratgey, settlement game. As the game went into 
further development, the whole concept became too expanded and we decided 
to put this project on hold.

We now have two alternative projects. These are Wizards Guild and Cosmo's 
Fun Class. Here is a description of both of them:-

Wizards Guild
The is an RPG which puts in the role a novice wizard. Wizards in the world 
that the game is based in feel the presence of something evil. They want 
you to join them to defeat this evil presence. All I can say about this 
game at the moment is that will be a Zelda style game, but with a slightly 
different angle.

Cosmo's Fun Class
You've probably heard about Adiboo from Alive MediaSoft. Now, we have 
decided to step into the Amiga education market with our character, Cosmo.
In our game, Cosmo's Fun Clas, children will be able to play fun educational 
games with Cosmo and his family and friends. A minimum of 31 activities will 
ensure that the child will be entertained for quite some time. Activities 
will include simple games such as Hangman Numbers and Battle Tanks (For 
hand eye co-ordination). There will also be more complicated activities
such as a Dizzy style cartoon adventure and a cartoon scene creator. There 
will also be tutorials on how do things such as
finding the area of a shape and typing.

We plan on getting Amigas with Cosmo's Fun Class into primary schools and 
if we're lucky, we should succeed in getting Cosmo as the educational 
mascot for the Amiga.

We currently have a demo version of this game. The demo has four basic 
activities. They are Hangman Numbers, Battle Tanks, a music player and 
Magazine Publisher.
