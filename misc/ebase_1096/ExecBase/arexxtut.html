Hello and welcome to the first part of an ongoing series that I will be
writing, based upon the ARexx language.  If you are a complete beginner
then I suggest you read the introduction and installation sections first
before continuing on with the rest of the tutorial. 
</p>
<h3>1 - INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>
ARexx is a high level programming language for the Amiga that is designed
specifically for controlling other programs externally.  It was first
introduced to the Amiga range when Amiga DOS 2 came out and has been with
us ever since, so if you dont have Amiga DOS 2 or higher then I suggest
buying a copy before you continue. If you have a copy of ARexx handy then
proceed to the next section.
</p>
<h3>2 - INSTALLATION</h3>
<p>
ARexx comes mainly in three parts, the program <i>RexxMast</i>, the cli
executable <i>rx</i> and all the other bits and pieces required for ARexx.
If you intend to use ARexx on a permanent basis (ie, if you are going to
follow this tutorial) then I suggest you put the <i>RexxMast</i> program in your
<i>WBStartup</i> drawer.  Now, you must place the program <i>rx</i> and its
counterparts into a drawer, preferably on your system disk, and assign
<i>REXX:</i> to that directory. For example, if I put all the exec's in a
drawer called <i>sys:rexxc/</i> then I would add the following line to my
<i>user-startup</i>:
<pre>
assign REXX: sys:rexxc

</pre>
and thats all there is to it! ARexx will now be up and running on your
system everytime you boot.
</p>
<h3>3 - YOUR FIRST AREXX PROGRAM</h3>
<p>
By now ARexx should be up and running on your system so it's time to
learn how to program.  All of the programs that are documented in this
series can be entered straight into a text editor and then run with the
following command:
<pre>
rx &lt;program&gt;

</pre>
So if I had just written a program with a text editor and I saved it with
the name <i>hd1:example1.rexx</i> then I would open a cli/shell and simply
type
<pre>
rx hd1:example1.rexx

</pre>
at the prompt.
</p><p>
We shall begin with the most basic program that I think every language
tutorial ever begins with and that is the famous "hello world" program.
<pre>
	/* My first program */
	say "Hello World"

</pre>
Looks pretty simple doesn't it? Now to cover it in full. The first line is a
comment. <b>All</b> ARexx programs <b>must</b> start with a comment.  A
comment is started with "/*" and ended with "*/", and everything in between
them is ignored by the interpreter.  The second line consists of a command
and a string, the command being <b>say</b> and the string being
"Hello World".  What the <b>say</b> command does is to simply type the words
inside the quotations onto the console (ie the cli/shell).  Lets take a look
at another example, this one prompts the user for their age and then tells
them approximately how many days old they are.
<pre>
	/* Age in days */
	say "Please enter your age"
	pull age /* &lt;--- New command! */
	say "You are approx" age*365 "days old!"

</pre>
The only thing different about this program that you may have noticed is
the command <b>pull</b>.  This command waits for the user to enter something,
followed by a carriage return and then puts it into a <b>variable</b>. In this
example, <i>age</i> is the variable (a variable can be any word as
long as it isn't an ARexx command). So if I entered "23" as my age then the
variable <i>age</i> would contain, you guessed it: 23.  Notice that there is
a second comment in this program, that was put there to demonstrate that not
only can you have a comment at the start of a line, but anywere you like.
The next line simply takes your age in years and multiplys it by 365
(Days in a year) and prints it out.  I will explain how this works.  
</p><p>
First, the <b>say</b> command prints the string inside the first set of
quotes ("You are approx"). Next, is a mathematical calculation:
<i><tt>age*365</tt></i>. '*' is the symbol for multiplication, and this expression
takes the variable <i>age</i> (which is equal to 23, or whatever you
entered - 23 for examples sake) and multiplies it by 365. The <b>say</b>
command then would print out the answer - which would be in this example,
23*365=8395. Lastly, the string inside the second set of quotes would be
printed. So in the end, the final <b>say</b> command would print 
<pre>
You are approx 8395 days old!
</pre>
</p><hr><p>
Some questions to think about, with answers in the next tutorial:
<ol>
<li>What would happen in the second example program if I put quotes around
the whole line? What would the <b>say</b> command print?
<li>If I told you my friend was 11680 days old, could you write a program to
tell me how many years old she is? If so, what is it?
</ol>
</p><hr><p>
Well I think that may be a good place to finish the first of my beginner
tutorials in ARexx. If you enjoyed this tutorial or you want to get into
some more exciting programs then stick around for my next tutorial, out
soon.  I'll leave you with some operators that can be used with a
variable, like we did with the age variable (<i><tt>age*365</tt></i>)..
<ul>
<lt>List of example operators</lt>
<li>*  =  Times by a certain number or another variable (Multiplication)
<li>-  =  Take away a value from a variable or vice versa (Subtraction)
<li>/  =  Divide a variable by a number or another variable (Division)
<li>+  =  Add two numbers or variables together etc. (Addition)
</ul>
