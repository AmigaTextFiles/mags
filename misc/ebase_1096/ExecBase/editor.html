<p>Welcome to <b>ExecBase</b>! The new online magazine for Amiga programmers.
This is a <b>volunteer</b> organization! We rely totally on the help of
Amiga programmers to write our articles. Currently the staff is a bit small
but it's growing!! </p>

<p>I hope that this will be the first of many issues. It's been a slow
start but I think things should go a little more smoothly from now on.
My schedule (work full time and go to school) has been pretty hectic lately,
so this issue is late. Sorry 'bout that. </p>

<p>Even though all but three articles were written by me, please don't
get the impression that this is a magazine dedicated to the genius that
is me ;) The only reason so many articles are by me is because the other
people on the staff haven't had enough time. Next month I hope there will
be more articles by other people. </p>

<p>Tell us what you think. Feel free to send us your questions and opinions.
Maybe we'll put your letter in the next issue. </p>

<p>Thanks!! </p>

<p>John Corigliano </p>
