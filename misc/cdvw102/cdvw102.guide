@NODE edit "Editorial Page"

There's been a lot of talk about the poor showing of the CD남 at the Winter
Consumer Electronics Show.  However, a recent publication called
the SHOW REPORTER gave the Amiga CD남 high praise.  

For a product criticized as not having a high enough profile at the show,
it was apparently high enough to be noticed by some people in a position
to let others know about it.  That's a GOOD thing.

In a section of the publication called TEN BIGGEST DEALS AT WINTER CES, the
slew of new videogame systems displayed at the show (3DO, Jaguar and CD남)
came in at number six.  The Amiga CD남쟷as the first system mentioned in a
recap of what was presented at the show.  

In a section called HOT PRODUCT PICKS, the CD남쟷as not only mentioned but
given a quarter page description with a color photo.  (The Jaguar was also
mentioned, in all fairness).  The title of the CD남 description was "Coming
to America".  The description noted the strong sales of the machine in the
UK.  

On the last page of the magazine, some top journalists from consumer
electronic magazines were asked to pick their "Best in Show" awards.  Jim
Willcox, editor of TWICE magazine, picked the CD남 as one of his personal
favorites.

SHOW REPORTER was sent to all attendees of the show and that is obviously
going to include some high-ranking officials in a position to give more
exposure to the machine.

Commodore has said that the reason that their booth was not on the show
floor competing with the "high traffic" booths of the 3DO and Jaguar was
so that they could work out deals and introduce the machine to people in a
position to carry the machine in retail outlets.  Some people, myself
included, thought that excuse was merely to mask the fact that they did
not have the money to allow for a flashy booth.  Commodore may just have
played it smart and saved money and still gotten the type of profile that
the machine needed to get into the retail stores.  Rumors indicate that
Electronics Boutique, Blockbuster Video, Software, Etc. and possibly
Wal-Mart have expressed more than a little interest in carrying the CD남.

If these reports are correct, the machine will be given a better start than
many have forecasted.  We can only now sit and watch...and wait.

Sean,

Your first issue of CD남View looks great!  Just a couple of comments...

The price on 3DO was reduced a couple of weeks ago to a suggested 
retail of $499.

My friends in the Atari world tell me the expected price of Jaguar CD-ROM
is $199, availability will be in June.  However, until it materializes,
that's still strictly rumor.

Hi Sean!

I just grabbed the first issue of CD남View Magazine (Can't do the nifty &
small '32' like you can from my BBS.) and I thought it was great!

Keep up all the good work, and keep the CD남 Community going (as well as us
Amiga junkies who've had mass contact with the CD남!).

Hi there,

I just read CD^32 view, and, like you asked, I am offering my opinions.

I like most of it. Why did you include the pic as a GIF file? So PC-dudes
can see it? Then I think it would be best if you also included a plain
ASCII file, so more people can read and learn about the CD^32 and maybe
buy a unit.

I don't have Labyrinth of Time yet, but I think the review on it was good
- I believe I know what to expect - basically a good looking game, slightly
flawed by loading time and user-interface. I think it got a fair rating.

Keep up the good work,

W. Lamee

@NODE ERRORS "Whoops!  We goofed."

Jaguar Specs Not Quite Right
----------------------------
While it's not really an error, we listed the actual processor types for
all of the new videogame systems with the exception of the Atari Jaguar. 
We merely listed the system as 64-bit.  The Jaguar uses two 32-bit
proprietary RISC-based chips known as "Tom" and "Jerry" on a 64-bit data
bus.  We also listed the speed of the unit at 55 MIPS, a figure that's
being disputed widely.  If anyone has any updated specs on the Jag,
please let us know!


Articles Pushed Back an Issue
-----------------------------
We had to push back a few articles until the next issue.  I got a bit
ambitious on what I thought I could actually get accomplished for this issue.

The review of DIGGERS was pushed back because I wanted to make sure the
review of AMIGA CD FOOTBALL was given the amount of time it deserved.

The FMV module article was pushed back because I could not obtain a FMV
unit to review.  I've seen the unit, but I couldn't write a full review
based on the limited exposure I've had with it.

The article on using CDTV titles with the CD남 has also been pushed back
until the May issue.  I didn't allow myself enough time for a project
of that magnitude.

@NODE GAME1 "Microcosm Review"

MICROCOSM is one of the most anticipated games for the CD남 system.  Now,
it's finally available.  We've finally managed to get our hands on it.

(Editor's note:  We reviewed the PAL version of the game.  At press time,
Psygnosis was indicating that an NTSC version for general release was not
planned.  Commodore has indicated that MICROCOSM will be available with
the US release of the machine.)

This is a game that has been in development for a long time.  It's roots
go back to the CDTV.  Don't let that mislead you.  Unlike LABYRINTH OF
TIME, this game will NOT run on the CDTV.  It's a CD남쟥ame.

Psygnosis have always had wonderful introduction animations in their
games.  As if to flex the muscles that the new CD남 console provides,
the intro animation on MICROCOSM is the finest computer generated
animation I've seen short of the dinosaurs in the movie JURASSIC PARK. 
It's stunning.  The accompanying sound effects add a lot to the
atmosphere provided by the visuals.

One doesn't buy a game to watch the introduction.  Does the game live up
to the expectations and claims we've heard people make about it?

Let me say that this game has "slick" written all over it.  The
packaging is nice and of high quality.  Although the screen shots on the
box are from the PC version of the game, they do not mislead you on what
you will see when the game boots up on your CD남.

The game, if you don't know already, revolves around a plot similar to
the that of the movie FANTASTIC VOYAGE.  The player is in charge of
manning various miniature vehicles through the inner workings of the
human body to cure an ailing man.  You have to kill the viruses inside
the body and remove a computer controller device that is implanted in the
patient.

After choosing the part of the body you'd like to travel through first,
the game displays an animation of your vehicle (different vehicles for
different parts of the body) entering the bloodstream.

The game boils down to a simple shoot-'em-up.  You basically try to blast
everything that comes toward you, while simultaneously avoiding collisions
with objects and the walls of the veins or arteries you're passing
through.  

The graphics are stunning as you pass down the "pipes" of your patient. 
The walls glisten as if reflecting the spotlights from your craft.  The
action is fast, sometimes too fast, and really exhilarating.  After a
while, the graphics do fade into the background and you begin to
concentrate on the game.

FANTASTIC VOYAGE was also turned into a game.  It looked nice, but was
hard to control.  The same problem haunts MICROCOSM, but not nearly to
the degree that it did FANTASTIC VOYAGE.  The CD남's keypad type
controller is at fault here.  It simply doesn't provide enough control
over the direction of your vehicle.  It does get easier after repeated
plays, but it is frustrating at first.

For all it's slick packaging though, there seems to be one slight
oversight.  The snazzy looking instruction book is wonderful to look at
but it is not full of details on how to play the game.  More than one
person has contacted me via E-Mail to tell me that the information needed
to get from one level to another is not included in the manual.  And
frankly, without their help, I wouldn't have gotten to the second level. 
That's a real shame.  (See our new hints column for a tip.)

Nonetheless, I couldn't stop playing MICROCOSM for very long.  I'd stop
for awhile and grumble that the game was too hard, but I kept coming back
to it.  The hooks were in.  It's kept my attention longer than any
shoot-'em-up for the CD남 so far.

Waiting for this game has been hard for the CD남쟯wners who really wanted
to see what their machine can do.  Well, the wait is over.  MICROCOSM shows
that the CD남 CAN handle more than platform games and 16-bit type 
shoot-'em-ups.  It's just a shame that it didn't come with decent
instructions.

@NODE GAME2 "John Barnes European Football Review"

Sports games are important to a videogame system.  If you look at the Sega
Genesis or Super Nintendo, you'll see a load of sports games.  Some are
good and some are not so good.  There are a lot of them, though.

Right now, sports games are few-and-far-between on the CD남.  That's what
makes this game so glaringly bad.  It's got no competition, but yet it does.
If that makes no sense to you, let me explain:  The CD남's first sports
game is the one that people will initially point fingers at.  Since there
are few sports games on the CD남 right now, the consumer will compare
it to what is available on other systems.  "The CD남 stinks at sports games"
is the comment one will expect to hear after playing this game.

I don't profess to know anything about soccer.  I know the basic rules and
that's about it.  One thing I do know is that soccer games have always
been a lot of fun to play.  I've played soccer on videogame systems since
I owned an Atari 2600 in the early 1980's.  From that, I graduated to
INTERNATIONAL SOCCER on the Commodore 64 and then moved on to SENSIBLE
SOCCER for the Amiga.   However, I don't watch soccer on television and I'm
not particularly excited about the World Cup coming to the United States
this year.

This game is an exercise in frustration from the time you boot up to the
time you turn it off.  (And for me, there was not a lot of time in between.)
Passing to your teammates is nearly impossible.  Scoring is even harder. 
The computer didn't seem to have any trouble doing both.

The graphics and sound are adequate.  They're not bad, but I was shocked
when I saw the Amiga version of the game.  There is no difference between
the two versions.  The CD남 version should have something extra.  The
game doesn't cost as much as other CD남쟴itles, so it's not like they're
trying to sell this as a top-of-the-line release.  That's honest enough.

I hate to trash the game, but it asked for it.  I'm not familiar enough
with the soccer scene to know who John Barnes is, but I don't think he'd
want to play this game.

@NODE GAME3 "Amiga CD Football Review"

I'm a huge football fan.  As a result, I love playing football on
videogame systems.  Not being much of an athlete, I can't say that I know
what actually playing the game is like.  I have played a lot of football
on videogame machines and computers, so I do know what I like about those.

AMIGA CD FOOTBALL is a game I've been waiting to play ever since I knew
that it was in the works.  I saw a report of the original CDTV version in
a magazine and I waited for it to be released.  That was a long time ago.
Now that it's here, it doesn't look like much was changed since it was
announced for the CDTV.

Upon starting the game, the player is present with a CDXL animated
"assistant coach."  He points out the three different types of play
available: Arcade, Coach and Commissioner and provides some humorous
comments about the game.

The arcade option is similar to most videogame football offerings on
other consoles.  The user calls the plays and then controls the players.
The coach option allows the user to call the play, but the computer
controls the players.  This gives the game a more strategy oriented feel.
The commissioner option isn't really a game.  It's more like a glorified
demo mode.  Simply pick the teams and then watch the game.  The user
doesn't call plays and cannot control the players.

After selecting the type of game and selecting your team and opponent, a
pseudo-sportscast begins.  Various commentators give their opinion about
the teams, the weather conditions and possible strategies the players
might try to use.

Then, finally, the game begins.  After the kickoff, the player is
presented with the appropriate play selections.  There are a wide variety
of plays available to both the offense and the defense.  The plays are
color coded as to what type of play they are.  Orange indicates a running
play/defense and green indicates a passing play/defense.  Grey plays are
special-teams plays like punting and field goal attempts.  To make the
play-calling during a two-player game, playbooks for both the offense and
defense are included.  In the playbooks, each play has a number that can
be entered via the controller to keep the other player from knowing
exactly what play is being selected.

So, how does AMIGA CD FOOTBALL stack up to the competition?  It's a solid
football game that does show it's age a bit.  Graphically, it's on a par
with the 16-bit football games.  After playing my fair share of football
on the Super Nintendo and the Genesis, there's nothing that AMIGA CD
FOOTBALL offers that beats those systems.  It cannot hope to compete with
something like JOHN MADDEN on the 3DO.  It's roots are firmly planted in
the 16-bit CDTV and that's not something that will sit well with those
CD남 owners looking for a game to brag about.  I loved the passing game
and the large selection of plays.  Unlike JOE MONTANA '94 on the Sega
Genesis, the whole play selection and execution process is something that
can be mastered in just a few downs.  You can concentrate on the game
rather than fumbling with the controls.

The CDXL animation is used well and looks fairly good.  It's rather
grainy in some instances though and there's some fringing on some of the
graphics.  (The crowd scenes following a touchdown and the "assistant
coach" are the worst cases of this.)  The voices during the game can get
annoying after a few games, but they can be switched off.

If this game had been released on the CDTV, it might have actually sold
some CDTV's.  Three years ago, I'd have purchased a CDTV to play this game.
I wouldn't say this is a game I'd buy a CD남 to play, but I'd surely buy
the game if I owned a CD남.

(Editor's Note:  Putting this disc into a CDTV unit revealed some
interesting things.  The game will not run on a CDTV, but it can be
browsed if you use a program like DirWork or Directory Opus.  It reveals
how little the game has changed since the game was developed for the
CDTV.  The icon for the game still reads CDTV SPORTS FOOTBALL.)

@ENDNODE

@NODE GAME4 "International Karate + Review"

This is the type of CD남 game I'm ashamed to admit exists.  INTERNATIONAL
KARATE + (aka IK+) was available on the Commodore 64.  It hasn't changed at
all since then.

Now, I'll stand by a game that remains unchanged from platform to platform. 
That's usually the sign of a classic game.  Only a few games actually
deserve that status.  This game is not one of them.  

It's bad enough that the game, a simple karate beat-'em-up, has been ported
from the ECS Amiga unchanged, but the game's attract mode still tells
you to press keys like F1 and F2 to select players.  The last time I looked,
a keyboard is not standard equipment for the CD남.  They could have at
least cleaned up the code to show the proper buttons to push on the CD남's
controller.  If you need an example of shovelware, this game is it.

All gripes aside, the actual game may have stood it's ground in 1988 (the
copyright date of the game, still proudly displayed in the attract mode),
but IK+ just doesn't cut it anymore.  This is the age of STREET FIGHTER II
and MORTAL KOMBAT type beat-'em-ups.  IK+ looks very much like the port of
an 8-bit Commodore 64 game that it is.

It wouldn't be that bad if you could use the CD남's control pad to at least
salvage some nostalgia from the game.  As it stands, the CD남 control pad is
almost impossible to use for this game.  We plugged a normal Amiga/Atari-type
joystick in and it worked much better.  Unfortunately, that's not saying
much.

Save your money, avoid this game.

@NODE RATINGS "The Ratings - Explained"

We judge the games we review in four different categories:

Graphics
--------
This is pretty self explanatory.  The higher the percentile, the better
the graphics are.

Sound
-----
Another no-brainer.  The higher the percentile, the better the sound. 
Although, this also relates to it's coordination with the gameplay.  If 
the sound seems inappropriate for the type of game it is, the game will
score lower in the Sound category even if the sounds are technically well
done.

Gameplay
--------
The gameplay refers to the addictive quality of the game as well as the
way the game plays.  If you find your self sitting and watching rather
than interacting with the game, the game will score lower than one that
actually involves you.

Control
-------
This refers to how easy the game is to control given the standard CD남 
controller.  A game requiring a special controller that is not specified
or not included will be penalized.  A game that comes with a special 
controller or one that recommends that, say, an Amiga mouse might work
better than the standard CD남 controller will not be penalized.

MGM/UA, the studio with the rights to such Hollywood classics as ROCKY

CD-Video format currently is supported by the Philips CD-I player and the
Commodore/Amiga CD남 through the use of a full-motion video module.

MGM/UA has agreed to produce 30 films in the CD-Video format for use with
these systems.  Apparently, Philips will have their pick from MGM/UA's
film library which includes hit movies like THELMA AND LOUISE, 16 James
Bond titles, RAGING BULL and A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS.

MGM/UA joins Paramount Studios as a charter supporter of the CD-Video
format.  Through a similar agreement with Philips, Paramount has released
such titles as TOP GUN, STAR TREK VI and SLIVER on CD-Video.

@ENDNODE

@NODE SHOV "Shovelware: Dead?"

According to recent reports, some game companies are taking a hard, fast
look at the sales numbers that the CD남 is racking up in Europe and
throwing themselves into developing real games for it.

Apparently, PC game companies are beginning to develop CD남 titles in
tandem with their PC CD-ROM titles.

This is encouraging news, but no names have been given, so we really
don't know what to expect.

One report we received said something about Commodore UK negotiating with
LucasArts to get REBEL ASSAULT and DAY OF THE TENTACLE ported to the
CD남.  Since we cannot confirm that, it remains a rumor and nothing more.

@ENDNODE

@NODE SX1 "The SX-1 Module"

As reported last issue, Microbotics are readying a module that will
expand the CD남 into a full computer.  This module, called the SX-1, is
much closer to release than we originally believed.  It will add a serial
port, a floppy drive port, an RGB port and 2 Parallel ports (one for a
printer, the other for ParNet) to the CD남.  Expect this bundle of joy to
arrive possibly in late April at a price of around $150-$200 (US).

Some news for add-ons: The firm Eureka (Holland) are releasing a

on any Amiga and use it as a CD-ROM. It comes with a CD for the CD남
and software to mount it on the workbench, it fits in the serialport
and it also got a midi-interface (where are the CD+MIDI Cd's, any
titles available?).

The hardware is called The Communicator and I've ordered it already,
when I actually get it, I could write you about this fine piece of
hardware. Here's a kind of featurelist:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Communicator enables CD남 to communicate with other Amiga's. With
the Communicator, you can use CD남 as  intelligent CDrom drive.
Control your CD남 from  Scala and start Audio or  even Mpeg tracks.*
Or View iff aga/pcx/gif and other CD's even on non-aga machines. *
needs Mpeg cartridge.

Uploading and starting programs on the CD남 is possible making CD남 a
powerful stand alone Computer with communication and graphics
capacities far better than CD-I!  The Communicator plugs in the
keyboard plug and doesn't occupy the expansion slot.

Intelligent CDrom drive
The CD남 is a state of the art dual speed, multi-session drive.  With
the Communicator up- and download files from amiga to CD남 is
achieved with a speed of upto 115200 baud!  Because of intelligent
multi-tasking, both the CD남 and amiga can perform other tasks while
exchanging data, the internal logic of the communicator takes care of
error correction and insures error free data transfer.

SCALA, CD남, the Communicator and how they work together.
Scala specially wrote a new EX module for Eureka's Communicator.
With this EX module and the communicator it is now possible to
control both audio CD's and Full motion video CD's  (when an MPEG
cartridge is installed), starting audio and Mpeg tracks on CD남 from
SCALA on the remote machine. This makes CD남 a full blown Mpeg player
station for scala. At last full motion video can be played in SCALA
by using the Communicator, the CD남 and the Mpeg cartridge.

The MIDI interface
This popular music interface MIDI is supported.  The Communicator
comes with high speed MIDI IN/OUT and TRU plug.  MIDI can be used
from the CD남- or the amiga-side.  The Communicator can also be used
as stand alone MIDI interface on the amiga or CD남.  Popular programs
such as Bars&Pipes, Helm,Scala and many more can use Midi to control
anything from keyboards upto drum-computers.

Connectivity and safety
The Communicator connects to the CD남 keyboard plug, leaving the
expansion port free for Mpeg cartridges or memory expansion boards
and allowing still the keyboard plug being used (ported tru), all
circuits are protected against wrong connection and static
electricity so you can safely connect and disconnect two machines.
 
Viewing  CD disks
Now you can view IFF (including AGA), PCX, GIF and other pictures on
your CD남 by simply loading the picture CD in your CD남.  You can
also copy pictures to your Amiga.  Viewing aga pictures can be very
handy when the connected machine is non-aga such as the A500 and
A2000.  The Communicator supports also a unique Photo-mode which
enables it to display PhotoCD disks.

Control
CD남's control pad emulates the mouse.  The workbench , a terminal
program and Scala backgrounds are available on the CD.  Spare room of
the CD is filled with spectacular PD software.

The Communicator package contains:

- Communicator hardware with MIDI/Serial/keyboard plug.
- Communicator CD crowded with the Communicator program, utilities
  and PD software.
- Amiga disk for installing the amiga side and manual in
  English/German and Dutch.

Eureka's Communicator has 1 year warranty.  Retail price will be
around 250 DM including taxes.  Available mid March 1994.


Eureka company backgrounds Eureka, based in Beek(L) near Maastricht,
the Netherlands.  Was founded in 1989.  In 1992 Eureka started
developing hardware products for the amiga.  It's first product was
the Eurocomp, a broadcast quality composiet and Y/C video encoder.
After some custom hardware projects for the Dutch government, Eureka
decided to concentrate fully on designing products for the Amiga
market.  Further products are the Afterburner 50mhz 68030 turbo for
the A4000/A3000 and a Photoviewer for CD남.

@NODE CDAMI "CD남 Titles on the Amiga"

Some of our readers own Amigas with CD-ROM drives.  They may be
wondering what CD남 titles will work with their Amiga.  That's what this
column will help them find out.  We'll be testing two titles every month
to see if they'll work on any of these set-ups:  An Amiga 4000/040 with a
Texel DM-3028, an Amiga 3000T/030 with an NEC Multispin 38 or a CDTV
(which is basically an Amiga 500 with a built in CD-ROM drive).

It's quite possible none of them will work with the latter two systems. 
Both lack the AGA chipset that the CD남 contains.  But, knowing that a
lot of people own the older Amigas, we didn't want to ignore them.

This month's games:  LIBERATION and ZOOL

LIBERATION
----------
Forget about this game in CD form if you own a non-AGA machine.  LIBERATION
is available on disk for both the non-AGA machines and the AGA machines. 
Playing it from CD on anything but the CD남 prevents you from seeing the
wonderful introduction sequence.  The game will work on an AGA machine
with a CD-ROM drive without any problems at all.  Just pop the disc in
your CD-ROM drive and click on the provided icons.  That's it.  No fumbling
with trying to launch it from the shell or anything like that.


ZOOL
----
ZOOL for the CD남 bombed out on the Amiga 4000/040.  It GURU'd the machine.
The CDTV refused to boot with it in the drive.
The A3000T/030 recognized the disc (as did the A4000/040), but refused to
run the program.

I found this, may be helpful:

MICROCOSM

A Tip for playing....

After hours of going round in circles in the cephalic vein, I have
finally found out that you can control your destination when you hit
the sheild points.

Go to the map (Left Action), and press the yellow button to select
where you want to go(The Red bits).

If you take a wrong turn, you can press the Green button + Left Action
button to "Hyperspace" to the highlighted part.

I can't seem to find this info in the manual or the ingame info.

Some Omission, huh?
