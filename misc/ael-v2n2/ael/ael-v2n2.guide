Editor's Corner             by @{"Lori Vinciguerra" link P6}

Well, we finally have seen the resolution of the Commodore buyout.
For those of you who haven't heard, Escom AG, a large computer retailer
in Germany has purchased Commodore's assets for $10 million.  For those
of you who are interested in more details of the liquidation proceedings,
see Amiga Report Online Magazine Special Auction Issue, April 21, 1995
(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/Amiga/News/AR/).  A special thanks to all
of the work that Jason Compton has done in covering the liquidation and
in providing the Amiga community with Amiga Report.

It is not known how the takeover will affect the Amiga market, however,
now is the time to give suggestions to the new owners about the future
of the Amiga in education.  I would welcome suggestions from educators
on additions to my article "Advice for Escom".  I intend to include Escom
on my distribution list for this newsletter.  However, as of this date,
there is no known e-mail address contact point.

I haven't received any offers from people willing to write an article
for the AEL newsletter.  I know that you are all very busy, but I think
others that are reading this newsletter would find your stories very
interesting.  I would encourage people to send in their articles for the
August edition by July 15, 1995.  You may email them to
owl@davinci.reading.ma.us.

@toc "menu"

Product: Analay, version 1.11 (English Version)
Author:  Marc Necker
Email:   Marc@buster.tynet.sub.org
Price:   Available on Aminet in directory /pub/aminet/misc/math.

         Shareware fee of 20US-$/30DM. See the documentation for
         further information. Some functions are disabled in the
         unregistered version, e.g. the print-function. The Analay
         Archive without key file can be distributed freely as long
         as all files are kept together. You also may place it on
         PD-collections or CDs.


Analay is a new numerical analysis Program which provides all the standard
functions such a program needs. The special feature of this program is the
integrated DTP mode which allows you to lay out a page with full WYSIWYG!
The program is divided into two independent parts running at the same time
as separate tasks.

The Math-Mode contains all functions for plotting and analyzing function
graphs. It's no problem to derive functions or to calculate the zeros or
the area between functions to name only three of the many facilities.
Moreover, the design of the graphs can be changed in many ways. You also
can place text, points, etc. in the windows or hatch an area. Tables, lists
and legends can be created as well.

The layout Mode contains a small but complete DTP Program with full WYSIWYG
and Intellifont support! It allows you to lay out a page with
function-graphs, tables, lists, legends, text blocks, etc. Moreover, it
knows formulas which no program apart form TeX was able to display or print
up to now! The page can be printed in highest printer resolution!

Requirements: AmigaOS 2.0 or higher and at least 1.5MByte RAM. More RAM and
a harddisk recommended.

To use all of the program's features AmigaOS 3.0 or higher is required
(e.g. color printout).

@node P3 "Advice for Escom in the Educational Market  "
@toc "menu"

                 by Lori and Ralph Vinciguerra


As the new owners of the Amiga technology, Escom AG, attempt to formulate
a marketing plan they must consider one of the biggest market areas:
education.  Schools, universities, and home educators are just beginning
to use computers to teach everything from literature and languages to math
and science.  Many educational institutions are trying to decide on which
platform to purchase and what types of software are available.  Many
educators that we have spoken to believe that the Amiga is a very viable
choice for schools.  However, certain actions on the part of Escom will
help inform the decision-makers that there is another choice besides PC
or Mac.  The suggestions which follow will help Escom foster the necessary
confidence in the Amiga and its new owners.

The first and most important action is to introduce the Amiga technology
into schools by providing educational discounts.  Loaner or free machines
should be placed in schools to expose teachers and children to the Amiga.
Apple has made huge inroads into the educational market because they have
seen the importance of supporting the school systems.  Also, children
who use Amigas in school are more likely to purchase them for home use.

Many schools and classrooms are starting to connect to the information
highway.  Leverage AmiTCP and AMosaic and produce an Amiga-based
Internet-in-a-Box.  Give it away FREE to schools who buy Amigas on an
educational discount (check out IBM's OS/2 Warp which has internet tools
bundled for an example). This will provide easy access to the Internet,
connecting the user with endless Amiga resources and countless Amiga
users.

Along the same vein, start an Escom Amiga World Wide Web site (also
gopher, mailserver, and FTP) which is both an AmiNet mirror and a source
for new information, system specifications, support, Q&A, suggestions, and
pointers to other Amiga resources. Get on the information superhighway!
All of the other major players (Sun, Apple,SGI, HP, IBM) are out there.
This will give educators an immediate contact point on the Internet and
confidence in the Amiga.

Direct market to home educators. A low cost, highly capable machine like
the Amiga 1200 would be very effective if co-marketed with a handful of
educational software packages and perhaps a magazine devoted to the topic.
The Amiga Educator's List Newsletter is published quarterly and is a free
resource for people with e-mail or Internet access.

Vision impaired people who could benefit from the built in speech capability
should be a very good market. Inform special education departments at
schools and universities of the Amiga's strength in this area.

Provide seminars for schools to learn how to integrate computers into their
classroom.  Not only would Escom benefit from the seminar fees, but the
Amiga name would be remembered when the school goes to purchase machines.

Advertise in magazines which target educators.  There are large sections
of family magazines, such as Family Life, Parents, Parenting, etc,
dedicated to software.  There are also trade magazines and catalogs
designed specifically to sell computers and software to educators.  Find
out what these are and make sure that the Amiga is visible.

An announcement for AC's Guide to the Amiga should be included with each
new machine.  Perhaps ESCOM and PiM Publications can negotiate shipping
one issue of the Guide with each machine.  This would provide the user
with a list of a majority of the available software.  It would also
provide the publisher with a chance to advertise Amazing Computing. Since
there is a whole section devoted to education, it would help inform
teachers of the amount of available software.

Make the Amiga easy to network.  Many schools are networking machines
from different classrooms together to avoid to management of large
numbers of floppies.  Apple has done an excellent job of providing
networking support with the MacIntosh.  The Amiga should at least come
with simple networking software and the means to hook machines together.

We hope that the representatives from Escom consider carefully each of
these suggestions.  The Amiga is now represented in at least 100 schools
or school systems in the United States and Canada alone (see school list).
Because it has been successful in these schools, we believe that the
educational market is open to the acceptance of Amigas.  Escom has
the opportunity to enter this market at a critical time.  We wish Escom
good luck in their newly acquired business.

Schools are using Amigas

The following is a list of schools with Amiga Labs.  If there are more of
you out there or if any of these no longer exists please let us know. We
will attempt to maintain an updated list and publish it in the AEL
newsletter on a regular basis. As you can see from the current list, we
are interested in all levels of schooling, from K-12 to college.  I have
received many inputs for the list this month.  I have also included the
list from "Famous Amiga Uses" compiled by David Tiberio and available on
Aminet.
