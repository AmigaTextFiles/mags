     THEY always scoffed at the mention of the Amiga.  THEY always laughed
 and asked you why you hadn't bought a PC.  THEY said that all it had was
 some games. Who?  PC owners ofcourse.  Whenever you show a PC owner an
 Amiga there instinct reaction has always been, "So what?  Who cares that 
 it has great games?  I have Word Perfect!"  So you went and showed him 
 some demos.  Once again, he replied "So what?  I have Word Perfect!"  
 when he grilled you on whether you had Word Perfect, you had to admit that
 all you had was an old version.  But now, the time has come to throw off 
 the shackles.  We finally have the software we need to make the Amiga a 
 business machine (plus have a little fun playing games on the side).  Not
 only are most of the software titles mentioned in this article good, but
 ALL of the them are NEW!  
     The first field we will look at is that of word processing, a type of
 software that almost no computer doesn't have on it's hard drive.  Just 
 a year ago we had the American Amiga users using Softwood's Final  
 Copy 2 and New Horizons' ProWrite 3.3, the European users using Digita's 
 Wordworth 2, and a few using a smattering of different word processors, 
 such as Excellence!, Turbo Text, or Pro Text.  Then both Softwood and 
 Digita came out with new version of their products, and both made claims 
 of being the best word processor on the market.  With such bold claims, 
 and Softwood's new attention on the European market, a rivalry was bound 
 to start, and that has made both companies continuously upgrade their 
 products in the hope of coming out with a new feature before their 
 counterpart, and thus winning more of the market.  Because of this 
 constant upgrading, we now have Final Writer release 3, Wordworth 3.1, and
 Wordworth 3.1SE, a cut down version of Wordworth 3.1 for machines not as 
 blessed in the CPU and RAM  departments.  These word processors are light 
 years ahead of their earlier incarnations, sporting such features as 
 spell checking as you type and table generation, and with this rivalry 
 they can only keep improving with time.  Ofcourse, you can still get other
 word processors, some notable ones are Pro Text 6.5, a great program for 
 documents without pictures, Rashumon v3.0, which has multi-lingual 
 support, Turbo Text II, and Maxon Word. 
     Another product that no Amiga should be without is a directory
 utility.  These programs allow you to point and click to delete, rename, 
 copy, move, decompress, view, edit, and do a multitude of other tasks on 
 files and directories.  In 1993 and 1994 we could use Directory Opus 4.12,
 which was one of the most popular, and most highly rated, programs of all 
 time.  You could also use Disk Master 2, but the company that made it had 
 gone out of business, so the outlook for upgrades was not good.  In early 
 '95, however, we got both an upgrade to Directory Opus, v5.00, and a new 
 challenger to the crown, MaxonTools.  Hopefully these products will start 
 a rivalry as Final Writer and Wordworth have, although Directory Opus is 
 supposed to be so good that it will destroy MaxonTools under its foot like
 Godzilla crushed Tokyo.  
     The most depressed portion of the Amiga software market had long been
 the money management field.  Sure we had Phasar, Home Accounts, and PFM,
 but when we saw Quicken and MYM our jaws hit the floor.  Well, you can 
 stop drooling now, because two new programs came out in 1994, and eight 
 more are coming out in early 1995!  These programs are Money Matters 3 
 by Digita, which is essentially Home Accounts 3, Invoice-it by Legendary 
 Design Technologies, Pretium by Intelligent Design Inc., Best Business 
 Management by Software Technology, General Ledgers by GP Software (makers 
 of GP Fax) and Jonathan Potter (Directory Opus), CheckitOut by Bug Free
 Developments, Easy Ledgers by Small Biz Software, a new version of Phasar,
 MicroTrader by MicroActive, and Checks and Balances by Amisoft.  With all
 these programs to choose from you should have no problem finding a good
 program.  And there should be no problems with new updates, because with
 so much competition, these companies have to keep on upgrading their
 products of have their software get looked past in the stores. 
     Moving onto telecommunications, we can't really say that the Amiga has
 been left out of the field.  All you really need for it is a modem, which
 are compatible with all computers, and some telecommunications software.
 However, this year we are getting some upgrades and new products that
 should make the Amiga comm market better.  GP Fax and TrapFax, two fax
 programs, are both being upgraded, as were Phone Pak and Advanced Voice
 Mail, two programs which allow your Amiga to receive phone calls and
 handle them like a voice mail system.  A new commercial comm program came 
 out, named Termite, although the PD/Shareware programs Term, Terminus, 
 NComm, RIPComm, and many others are very good Comm programs, and well 
 worth checking out if you need some Comm software.  Buying a modem itself 
 has never been a problem, because modems are normally connected to the 
 Serial of Parallel ports, and all Amigas have these two ports, but if you 
 own an A600 or A1200, then you can now buy a PCMCIA modem thanks to 
 Scala, who released software that allows you to connect a modem that 
 supports speeds of up to 28,800 baud.    
     In no other software field on the Amiga had there been such domination
 by one piece of software as in database programs.  For a long time
 SuperBase had been the acknowledged winner.  It was upgraded all the way
 to SuperBase 4, with both Personal and Pro editions for home and office 
 use.  But in 1995 we will receive 5 new database programs, ranging from 
 low end to high end.  Softwood was the first to announce its database 
 program, Final Data, and, Digita, not wanting to fall behind, announced 
 their own database program, Data Store.  Data Management and Research are 
 also programming a database program, MultiFinder, Maxon continues their 
 entry into new fields of the market by introducing Twist, and Merian 
 Software & Design are upgrading Database Professional to v2.00 to compete 
 directly with SuperBase Pro.  These programs will face a tough challenge 
 to form a niche out of the Amiga database market, as SuperBase not only 
 is one of the best database programs on any computer, but there is also a 
 PC version and many software packages that work directly with it.  
     Now I can hear you thinking that this is all great, but there can't
 possibly new spreadsheet, because the Amiga never gets spreadsheets.
 Personally, I could care less if the Amiga didn't get a new spreadsheet,
 they seem to be the most useless programs in the universe to me, but for
 any Amiga users who have been holding their breath waiting for nine years
 waiting for a spreadsheet, 1995 just may be your year.  First, TurboCalc
 is being upgraded to v3.0, and the goal is to make the program good 
 enough not only to challenge Microsoft Excel, but to beat it!  And back 
 once again, Softwood is releasing yet another great product, Final Calc,
 and are also claiming that it will be on the level of Excel.  If their
 past word processors are any indicator, this program should be great.
     Ofcourse, there is more software being released, but if I kept on
 writing I'd never finish.  I haven't even touched graphics programs, still
 the biggest field of software titles for the Amiga, and I haven't looked
 at the hardware or games being released!  As you can see, a few companies
 have really ratcheted up their Amiga productions, like Softwood, Digita, 
 and Maxon, and hopefully, if any other companies go under, as has been
 rumored with Innovatronics, those bigger companies, who have a lot riding
 on the Amiga market, should pick up their products and programmers.  
 Doesn't that make you feel better about your Amiga?  And hey, if that PC 
 owning friend scoffs at your Amiga again, give him a punch in the nose  
 for me, OK?

REVIEW


    "Lords of the Realm" pits six different lords in a contest to become  
 king of England. The winner will have managed the various counties of  
 England through farming, ranching, castle-building, diplomacy and warfare.
 
    I was instantly attracted to "Lords of the Realm" by its multi-player 
 fan of capability, since multi-player games are rare on the Amiga. I am
 also a 'god' games and strategy games, and "Lords" has elements of both. 
 It is unfortunate that "Lords" does not fulfill either of my expectations.

    Up to six persons can play "Lords of the Realm." The game is turn- 
 based, so each player has to pass the mouse around to the next person. 
 Null-modem or modem support would have been very helpful so the computer 
 desk would not be overcrowded. According to the manual, the IBM-compatible
 version does have that capability; why is the Amiga version lacking?

    "Lords" claims to have a "detailed economic simulation." Perhaps it is 
 detailed, but any idiot can skip the details. Each county has peasants who
 can herd cows, herd sheep, tend the fields, grow crops, mine iron, cut 
 timber, make weapons or build castles. Players must adjust the numbers of 
 peasants at each task in order to make the county prosper. All this work
 is totally unnecessary.  Apparently, your peasants earn so much money that
 taxes can help you buy all the materials you need from traveling 
 merchants...
 
    The strategy element of "Lords" is poor as well. For about 10,000 gold 
 pieces (a very low price), you can raise an army of 200 merc crossbowmen
 and 200 knights. The army can annihilate almost any force thrown at it by 
 surrounding the enemy with knights and pouring crossbow bolts into the
 crowd.  The enemy is almost certain to run away eventually. What kind of 
 strategy is that? 

    Castle building is the most exciting part of the game because it is
 like a paint program. You can make funny faces, mazes and the like with   
 it.  Honestly, the most effective castle in the game consists of one keep,

 surrounded by a low wall and dozens of wooden mess halls. Yes, in "Lords
 of the Realm" wooden mess halls are impervious to catapults, trebuchets, 
 infantry, siege engines and probably fire. Any army sieging your castle
 will just sit there and try to starve you out, but you'll have so much
 food in the mess halls you would certainly outlast them.  The computer's 
 castles can be captured easily with a band of peasants because the game's 
 castle combat system makes all troops--from peasants to  knights--
 EQUAL STRENGTH. There is no sense in that.
 
    The last heralded feature of the game, diplomacy, fails to be much more
 than a way to send personalized insults to other human players. Games
 versus computer players are over so quickly that the slowing tactics of 
 alliances and flattery are next to useless.

    To summarize: Don't buy. There is little depth in "Lords of the Realm."
 Your money would be better spent on "Abba's Greatest Hits," volumes I and 
 II.

    In using our Amigas and making Amiga Link, we have come across 
 some products and services that we believe exemplary.  They are:    
 
 Amiga Report:  This is a wonderful disk magazine, which partly inspired 
 the making of Amiga Link.  It has many good articles on the Amiga, 
 inluding hardware reviews, and if there is any news on the Amiga, it's 
 editor, Jason Compton, will know it!
 
 Heddley:  This is a program to make Amiga Guide documents (such as the one
 you are reading write now), and it is incredible!  Not only is it very 
 easy to use, but it also quarters the time it takes to make an Amiga 
 Guide doc and has many great features!  It's so good that we use Heddley 
 here at Amiga Link!  You can find Heddley on Aminet.  The author is Edd 
 Dumbill.

   Wrapping maps of the earth on spheres is probably something everyone has
 had a chance to do by now, mostly because all it takes is to wrap a      
 square brush into a round hole.  This is also what I am doing today, but  
 as a last step to a more involved procedure.  To get started, go into a  
 paint program like Brilliance or DPaint.  We will first make a brush of a
 square grid, so we can see how the warping effects will look on a sphere.
 Turn on the grid option, it's default settings are good enough for this 
 example.  Using the filled rectangle tool, draw a rectangular area with a 
 vertical dimension about 30 pixels larger than the horizontal dimension.  
 Make a grid pattern on this surface, using the grid option and a color
 that shows up on the rectangle.  When the grid is finished, save it in 
 one or two of the spare brush wells, clear the screen and turn off the  
 grid tool.
   This technique will involve viewing the sphere from an orbit in the 
 northern hemisphere using the grid brush we just made.  Grab the grid   
 brush from the spare brush well.  Select "bend-vertical" from the brush 
 distortion control panel, and Bend the center of the brush about 30 pixels
 down.  This gives the grid sort of a "sagging" effect.  Put the brush on 
 the screen, and grab the largest square area from the center of this new 
 grid.
   Now we will wrap this new brush in the usual way.  Select the filled 
 circle tool, then select "stretch" in the draw modes control panel.  Now 
 draw a circle in the center of the screen.  The sagging horizontal lines 
 of the grid have now become lines of lattitude on a convincing sphere, and
 we can see over the top of the north pole.
   The vertical lines of the grid don't converge on the north pole where  
 they should, but this is ok since if we use a planet map, as there are no
 lines to give this away.  There are many places to get a planet map.  
 There is a two color map that comes with DPaint, I have a hi-res 16 color 
 map of the earth on Aminet, included in my Splatterpaint paint program, 
 or you can make a map yourself rather quickly.  My planet map contains the
 extreme polar areas just  to use this technique.
   This technique works best in animations, and you really get the feel of 
 being in a polar orbit of the planet.  I have put my animation of the  
 earth onto Aminet, PlanetaryFlyBy.lha in gfx/anim so you can see how to 
 effectively use this technique in a planetary fly-by animation.

 Review
   
     This game has been out for some time now;  I think in some respects it
 is a ground breaking game for its artwork alone. The game play is another 
 story.  I myself had been eagerly awaiting this game.  I have had it over 
 a month now.  I have managed to get to the second level.  The premise of 
 the game is you control a little red guy called Mutt.  Mutt is on a quest 
 to find a Pizza.  The pizza is somewhere in a maze with 5 levels.  The 
 levels consist of hallways and rooms.  Each room is unique; some are 
 variations on a theme.  You control Mutt with the CD32 control pad thing.
 Mutt is little red guy with short wings and horns; hence the title 'Litil 
 Divil'.  You start out each level at the edge of a bridge spanning a
 chasm.   To get past the bridge you have to defeat a big troll who is 
 armed with a club.  Mutt is armed with a staff of wood.  It is basically 
 a bit of arcade a style mini-game.  The animation is really quite good   
 here.  There are so many frames of animation that the action is quite   
 fluid.  Obviosuly, the artists behind his game know how to animate things.
 after you defeat the Troll, you can enter the maze.  I should mention the 
 mini game is presented from a side view.  
     When in the actual maze, the view is like something like the classic 
 Dungeon Master.  You have the perspective of being in a maze with Mutt 
 centered in the view.  There is a bar indicating Mutt's health.  As soon 
 as you are in the maze, Mutt's health will start to go down.  When
 Mutt runs out of health - game over.  You are presented with Mutt getting
 tossed in a magically conjured hole in the maze by the game's villain;
 some guy called the Entity.  But there is food in the form of apples,
 cheese and other things in the maze scattered about. There is also gold;
 gold is very important because to complete some of the obstacles in the 
 mazes Mutt will often need some sort of weapon or item and to get said 
 item you go to a shop to buy it - how convenient.  You have got to wonder 
 about how come so many games have shops in them where everyone is out to 
 kill you.  How do these shopkeepers make a living?   Well, you never 
 actually see the shopkeepers in Litil Divil; if you enter one of the shop 
 rooms, you are presented with whatever items are available.  This is 
 part of the puzzle aspect of the game; you have to figure out through 
 trial and error what item is needed in which room.  Once you the have the 
 approraite item in some rooms they are automaticlly used or you have to 
 use them by pressing the blue button on the controller.  As well, in the 
 corner of the screen when exploring the tunnels, there is a autmap showing
 where you currently are.  Gremlin was also kind of enough to provide 
 some graph paper with the game to make maps.  And thoughout the tunnels
 are pits, flame thrower, and other things that get in your way.  You have
 to make Mutt jump around a great deal in some parts of the tunnels.  There
 a waste of time and mostly just cause Mutt to lose a lot of health
 are some tunnels that are because of the perils.
     The other way to regain energy is if sucessfully complete a room;
 also if you leave a room without completing it your engery will drop down.
 When a room is completed the room is gone from the maze. Sometimes when
 you complete a room, a new part of the maze is opened up.
     There are many types of rooms, some are puzzle games where you have 
 to repeat sequences; others you have to fight something and defeat it
 to get past. And some involve pulling ropes and levers to get to the  
 right combination to advance.  There are something like 50 rooms to 
 explore.  Some rooms are downright stupid because skill does not have
 does not have much to do with it seems like if you stumble around long
 enough you will finish them or you won't.  But the graphics are great; 
 that is one of things that appeal to me in this game is the variety of
 different rooms and creatures you encounter in them.  It keeps in 
 interested in playing the game.  Gremlin have gone the distance with the 
 artwork in this game.  You encounter things like mermaids, witches, sumo 
 wrestlers fire breathing trees (yes, fire breathing trees).  The rooms
 are presented from various angles.  Some rooms are bigger than the screen 
 size and scroll around if neccessary.  The background art for the rooms 
 are often superb.  You have to be bit patient to play this game because 
 you end up having to do things over and over and over again to sucessfully
 get past some obstacle.  
     There is a save feature in 'Litil Divil' but you can only save what
 level you are on.  Say you are halfway through level 2, you can only 
 save the game at the beginning of level 2.  Which is frustrating because
 you have to do everything all over on that level again if you continue
 a saved game.  This is not Gremlin's fault; it comes down to the lack of
 of non volatile RAM in the CD32.  A lot of games have suffered because 
 of this.  The manual for 'Litil Divil' claims that it will take advantage 
 of an expanded CD32 for saving game but it does not say how.  I was 
 playing the game with a SX-1 attached to the CD32 and nothing special 
 occured when I tried to save the game.  The SX-1 has an internal hard 
 drive.
     I have not finished the game; I do wonder if I will ever find the  
 pizza.  I hope there is some sort of end sequence in the game; one would
 think so; I myself like to see some kind of animation or fanfare if I
 sucessfuly complete a game.  (note:I am back on level 1 trying to get  
 past this room; I had erased my saved game a while ago inadvertantly)
 This game may not be to everyone's tempermant but if you don't
 get too easily ticked off by wandering through tunnels and stupid rooms 
 and you appreciate good animation this must be a game for you.  I think 
 this game is something of an achievement for its artwork.  It shows that 
 Gremlin took some time to design the artwork and rooms in this game but 
 as I have said many of the puzzles in the room are hard to get past and 
 not very fun to repeat over and over to get through them.  I would look 
 forward to sequel to this game.  This game shows the potential for the 
 CD ROM format.   'Litil Divil' is basically an interactive cartoon. 
 
 Control 
 
      For the most part the game control is fine using the game pad.
 But on some rooms it is a little awkward to precisely control
 Mutt.  The problem is worse with rooms that are isometric views
 at some faked perspective.
 
 Sound
 
      The sound and music are fabulous.  'Litil Divil' has some of the
 best music I have ever heard in a computer game.  The music
 is played from CD tracks.  Mutt does not really talk but he make
 all kinds of noises when he gets hurt or does something.  In one
 room if you complete it he looks at you and makes a snickering
 laugh.  The sound and music really add to game making it that
 much richer.

                          @{b}@{u}PA-RISC CPU and the HPUX OS@{ub}@{uu}

Hello, Amigaphiles. Here is some information on the PA-RISC CPU. This is one
of the potential RISC CPU's for the next generation Amiga computer,  code
named 3D-RISC.

My company develops CAD/CAM software for the textile industry on Hewlett
Packard RISC workstations. The models we develop for are the 9000/712 /715
/720 and /735. In this artical I will try and shed some light on  the
PA-RISC CPU and the HPUX operating system. The PA-RISC is one of the CPU's
being investigated as the future Amiga's processor.

HPUX

We use the HP UNIX (HPUX) Open View operating system that comes as the
standard operating system of the 700 series workstations. This is a UNIX
operating system with a X-Windows based GUI. You can launch programs using
icons or UNIX commands. Along the bottom of the screen is a  control panel
that contains the following items.

-Clock ; Self expanitory. -CPU activity meter ; Shows CPU and HD activity
-Shell button ; Opens UNIX command line interface -Screen Buttons ; Six
buttons, each one brings you to another screen. -Desktop ; Allows you to
personalise your environment.

By pressing the screen buttons you can move between screens 1-6. Each screen
can have multiple windows (or programs) running. This is similar to how the
Amiga screens work with the following differences.

1) In HPUX each screen is a copy of the desktop screen (ie. Workbench). 

- The Amiga can only have one Workbench screen with programs allocating
  the other screens.

2) In HPUX all of the screens (limited to 6) must be at the same 
   resolution.

- The Amiga can have as many screens as there is available Chip Ram
  and each can be at a different resolution. The Amiga also allows you to
  "pull down" screens.

How well does HPUX and the PA-RISC multitask? Flawlessly. Our current office
system consits of a 720 with 128 MB ram, off of this system we have 6
Xterminals. An Xterminal allows you to have a GUI of the system, basically
our configuration is like a system having 7 independent graphics cards. We
have tried having one program running on each screen of each terminal at the
same time. Let's see thats 7 terminals X 6 screens each = 42 programs
multitasking! Of course this does slow the system down. Now you can see how
the Amiga's pre-emptive multitasking is based on UNIX. Now remember while
HPUX is is a powerful mutitasking OS, since it is a UNIX OS the system code
is 2MB in size but needs a minimum of 16MB RAM to get  the GUI up. Imagine
the Amiga's small and efficient operating system   running on a PA-RISC CPU,
do the words "Speed, Speed, SPEED" make your  pulse rise?

Below are some of the HP systems using the PA-RISC and what type of power
they have.

               712/80       715/64      715/80      715/100      735/125

 Clock          80MHz        64MHz       80MHz        100MHz      125Mhz
 SPECint92      84.3         66.6        83.5         100.1       136
 SPECfp92       122.3        96.5        120.9        137         201 
 MIPS           92           78          97           122         154 
 MFLOPS         30.6         24.3        30.5         37.8        57.4 
 Cache          256kb        256kb       256kb        256kb       256kb 
 RAM Potential  128MB        256MB       256MB        256MB       400MB

All in all I have to say the the above numbers are pretty impresive. The
most powerful system we have in hose is a 715/100. We can manipulate a 16MB
24bit graphic image with amazing speed (mere seconds for image proccessing).
Trying to mearly rotate a 4MB 24 bit image on a Mac Quadra 650 (25Mhz 68040,
32MB RAM) takes about 3-4 minutes. A 100MHz PA-RISC CPU  as the engine of
the Amiga that uses about 1MB for its OS (after  Workbench is loaded) starts
to make me salivate.

                     @{fg shine}CODE CLINIC #1:    UP THE HILL...@{fg text}


 

-------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION




       
        It seems like only yesterday, I was slaving away at C64  Basic
 (1983) and knew that someday I would learn to write killer code; Then I
 bought an A500 (1989) and began rewriting my 64Basic to AmigaBasic, again
 I knew that someday I would write killer code. 
 
        I now own an A1200 and SAS/C 6.0 (waiting for my upgrade to 6.5). 
 I own several books with titles such as C by example and Teach yourself 
 C, and while these books are very helpful in learning the C language, you 
 will not be writing killer code by the end of the exercises. 

        In this column I will try to guide you "up the hill" to writing
 killer C code.  This column is not for beginners, it's assumed you have 
 an understanding of ANSI/C coding.  If you don't, any bookstore will have 
 books such as the ones I listed above. I myself will be learning new 
 skills as we go "up the hill."  Oh yeah, our goal is to reach the top.



 -------------------------------------------------------------PREP



     #include <stdio.h> 
        main() 
        { 
                printf("HelloWorld\n"); 
        }
        

     This is the first code every C programmer will learn. In this first 
 column we will `Amigatize' this code.  Basically, when I say `amigatize' I
 mean use Intuition.  Intuition is defined in the ROM Kernel Manual-
 Libraries as: the collective name for the function libraries, data 
 structures and other elements needed to create a graphical interface for 
 Amiga applications, AMIGATIZE!!!@{bg fill}



@{bg back}        How would you `amigatize' this simple program? 



        Here is a list of things we will do to make this an Amiga program.

        o OPEN A WINDOW IN WORKBENCH WITH A           
          CLOSEGADGET TO END THE PROGRAM.
 -----------------------------------------------------------LETS GO-

        This article is intended for NEW Amiga C language coders.
        Those of you who have genius IQ's, forgive us mere mortals.

        OK, with all that out of the way lets' dive into some code!

        Overview of the code:
        
        Included all the include files we needed.
        Prototyped our functions.
        Made IntuitionBase a pointer to struct Library.  Called Main().
        Made window a pointer to struct Window.@{bg fill}
@{bg back}        Opened intuition.library.         
        if intuition.library opened we tried to open a window.
        if not we ended.         
        if the window opened we called  handle_window_events() passing
         it the window pointer.
        if not we closed the intuition.library and ended.
        
        handle_window_events calls WaitPort
        and it waits till it gets the CLOSEWINDOW message
        after CLOSEWINDOW message is received return to next line of
         code after the call which is CloseWindow() which ends the 
         program.
        
        Well, that should be enough for the first dive into the world 
        of writing code for the Amiga.
                 I do urge anyone who wants to know more to do the

    You've saved your money, read the advertisements, scoured the magazines
hoping to find the discounts and at last you've done it.  You've bought your
EMPLANT board!  The wonderful day arrives and the EMPLANT is here! You
eagerly tear open the package and there it is, glimmering in the sun,
somewhere music strikes up and your vision is softly blurred.  No?  Well,
that's not what happened to me either.  When I first purchased my EMPLANT,
little did I realize the path that I was on.  A path fraught with Mac DOS,
ROM images and when exactly do I use 32 bit memory anyway?  By the end of
this article series, you will have some insight into the installation and
setup for the EMPLANT.
    I must say that even with all the work to set up and get it running, the
EMPLANT is one of my most prized Amiga addons.  The very bragging rights
alone are worth the aggravation that you encounter trying to get the board
set up!  There's nothing I like better than to tell my friends who are
bragging about their Pentiums and Quadras, that I run all the major brands
of software on one computer.  Yes, Amiga, Macintosh and IBM.  Ha!
    Just in case you are not aware of what the EMPLANT is, EMPLANT is a
hardware (board) and software combination that installs in your Amiga that
will allow you to run Macintosh software.  EMPLANT is made by a company
called Utilities Unlimited from Lake Havasu City, Arizona, USA. The
emulation is so exact that Macintosh viruses have been known to infect it!
    EMPLANT comes in four flavors.  They range from the basic board, a bare
bones version, no serial or SCSI to versions with serial only, SCSI only,
and the EMPLANT Deluxe with both SCSI and with serial ports.  The version
you choose depends on the use that you will make of the system.  EMPLANT can
share the SCSI and serial ports of your Amiga, but if you use the Amiga side
while the EMPLANT is running, it is better to get one of the higher end
versions.  If you only occasionally want to use the EMPLANT to run a
favorite word processor or game, the basic board may be more to your liking.
Utilities Unlimited will upgrade your board for the difference in cost
between models.  EMPLANT costs less for the Deluxe version than many god
SVGA and all current multisync monitors.
    EMPLANT is different than most software/hardware combinations because to
use the EMPLANT board successfully in your Amiga you need several things
beyond the basic board and software supplied with it.  You will need:

  *        An Amiga with ZII or ZIII bus, ADOS 2.04 or greater, at least 2
           Megabytes of fast ram (depends on the Mac DOS), and at least a 
           68020 CPU. 
           
  *        A dedicated hardrive or partition on your existing hard drive. 
  
  *        A high density floppy or, A low density Mac floppy and some 
           other special hardware for interfacing it to your Amiga.        
           
  *        A copy of Mac DOS or at least a system disk. 
  
  *        Mac software to format your hard drive. 
  
  *        A set of MAC ROMs.
  
  Whew, and we still haven't bought any applications programs to run on the
Mac!

    The Required Computer EMPLANT is designed to run on an accelerated Amiga
2000 and above. This is because it must have the Zorro bys to  operate.
There are also special addons that operate a Zorro bus for the  Amiga 500
and 1000 that are no longer in production to my knowledge.  If you have one
of them, the board should work with it as well.  Also, the  vanilla A1200 is
left out (no Zorro bus) although Utilities Unlimited has at least discussed
the possibility of an A1200 board.
    As far as memory goes, the minimum configuration varies with the version
of Mac DOS that is to be used (called System X.X in Macese).  A minimal
system can theoretically be run with System 6.X as a 24 bit machine in only
2 Megabytes of FAST RAM.  System 7.1 is much better and can be configured
(depending on your Amiga situation) as a 32 bit machine, but requires at
least 4 Megabytes of FAST RAM.  To achieve either of these two memory
configurations will require that you strip the startup configuration to as
minimal an installation as possible.  No cute Commodities, no User-Startup
assigns beyond the minimum required for EMPLANT, no WBStartup, and if you
can handle it, no Workbench.
    Mac DOS is such a memory hog that if you have this configuration, you
will have a small memory available for running programs.  Given this, the
"REAL" minimum system is at least 8 Megabytes of FAST RAM; 12 is better and
should give the ability to run most reasonable Mac software and usually two
or more application programs at once.  To give you an idea, on my 8 Megabyte
A4000, with a full startup on the Amiga side (a few Commodities and
Workbench), I have around 3.3 Megabytes left for System 7.1 and my
applications.
    Your Amiga must also have at least a 68020 CPU as well.  This rules out
the older unaccelerated machines such as the 2000 or the 2500.  Are we
beginning to sound like an accelerator board which allows added 32 bit
memory yet?  Speaking of accelerators, Utilities Unlimited recommends the
WARP board.  GVP Boards work as well, but incompatibilities have been known
to exist.
    Finally, the EMPLANT is required to run under at least System 2.04. If
you don't already have it, don't worry, just tell your spouse that you need
it, he or she will understand I'm sure.

                            The Hard Drive 
                            
    My personal choice was to use a partition on my main hard drive.
Depending on the type of EMPLANT you have purchased however, you can use:
  1.      A dedicated real Apple hard drive connected to the EMPLANT SCSI
controller,  
  2.      An Amiga Hard Drive connected to an Amiga SCSI controller,
  3.      A partition on an Amiga Hard Drive connected to either a SCSI
 controller or to an IDE controller.  This partition can be either present
as a Mac formatted partition or as a hard file.

    In any event, you will need a megabyte or two for the emulation software
itself and at least 10 megabytes for the Mac System software  (v. 7.1),
assuming of course that you do not want to have any programs  stored there
other than the system configuration.
 
        A tip here, don't use the name "EMPLANT" for your partition.
        EMPLANT (the program that is) uses an assign with that name
        and you will receive an error on startup.
        
                          The Floppy Drive 
                          
    If you own an A4000 like me, you more than likely have a high density
floppy drive.  If you're not sure, test it by formatting a high density
diskette and then look at the capacity.  1.76 megabytes, you're in luck;
880K, sorry.  To happen to have a high density floppy, you are in luck. Your
drive will read Macintosh high density diskettes once you install and run
EMPLANT.
    If you have a low density drive, you are left with one of two choices.
Either upgrade to a high density floppy or get some additional
hardware/software including a Mac low density drive.  The additional
hardware/software can be of several types.  EMPLANT supports the following
floppy devices/formats:
  1.      Its own propriatary EMPLANT format. 
  2.      Amax (a competing Mac emulator) 
  3.      Mac high density format 
  4.      Mac low density (800 K) format 
  5.      Sybil 
  6.      AMIA
  
    Of these, I most highly recommend the high density format.  Next the
AMIA with a real Mac low density drive is probably best.  I have no
experience with the Sybil however, I understand that production was
discontinued anyway.  Users I have noted on Internet seem pleased with it.
The AMIA (sold by Utilities Unlimited) device is a hardware connector that
allows you to connect the Macintosh floppy directly to the Amiga drive port
(or an external drive pass-through if you have an external drive).

                                Mac DOS     
                                
    The type of DOS that you should get depends on the Amiga hardware that
you have to run the Emulation.  If you have either an A4000 or a memory
expansion in a lesser machine that gives you 32 bit wide memory, go for at
least System 7.0.1 (7.1 is better; 7.5 is the latest available, but is quite
buggy so I hear).  I run System 7.1 on my A4000 and it works without any
flaws so far.  If you don't have 32 bit memory, System 6.8.4 is the latest.
It will only run in 24 bit mode.
    Make sure that you have a system diskette formatted in the style that
you have floppy drives, AMIA, HD drive, etc.  Normally, Mac DOS comes with
several other diskettes as you would expect.  My version 7.1 came with six
diskettes.  Now for the bad part.  Usually, Mac DOS does not contain
software to partition a SCSI hard drive.  In line with the usual Mac
mentality of "you don't need anything we don't give you", hard drives come
preformatted, often with the system already installed.
    If you are using an Amiga drive space, you will need software to format
and partition your drive.  I recommend "Quicksilver", but any Mac software
that supports drive manipulation will do.

                             Mac ROMs     
                             
    You must use Apple 256K Mac series II ROMs for EMPLANT.  The 512K and
higher versions supplied with the newer, consumer-version Macs such as the
LQ, etc. and the older 128K version such as is found in the Mac SE and Mac
Plus will not work.  The Mac models that support these 256K ROMs include II,
IIx, and IIcx models.  Next time, I will describe how to install the the
SE-30, Mac ROMs on the EMPLANT and/or grab the ROM images.  The ROM  image
can be grabbed while the ROMs are still in the Mac or with them  installed
on the EMPLANT board, we'll discuss both.
    The SE-30 ROMs come as a ROM-SIMM board.  The others come as a set of
four, 28 pin DIP packaged ROMs.  Sources for these chips are another matter
altogether.  I was lucky enough to have a Mac that I could dump the ROMs
from.  If you are not so lucky, some vendors will sell the ROMs to you.
Check Amiga magazines and the Comp.Sys.Amiga.Emulations newsgroup on Usenet
for other sources.
    Purchasing the ROMs from individuals is also possible over the Internet.
You can probably forget obtaining them directly from Apple or from an Apple
dealer.  Sometimes they will sell them to you, sometimes not. Many people
will confuse the 128K ROMs that can be used with the Amax emulator as being
the ones that work with EMPLANT. Remember only 256K ROMs will work.
    There are three versions or revisions of the 256k ROM that were created.
Any version will work.  Version 1.3 is the latest and most expensive.
Versions 1.1 and 1.2 were missing certain desirable characteristics such as
high density drive support.  EMPLANT has the appropriate drivers, etc. built
into the software so it really doesn't matter which version you use.
    Obtaining a copy of the ROMs (Dumping as it is called) carries certain
responsibilities with it as well.  To dump ROM files and then sell them is
software piracy.  The dumping process writes the "programs" built into the
ROMs to a computer file.  If multiple copies of this file is distributed, it
is all the same as copying commercial software and distributing it.
Purchasing the ROMs, dumping them and then selling them to the next EMPLANT
owner while you keep the file is also piracy.  Having a set of ROMs that you
have dumped or owning a Mac and dumping the ROMs is not piracy.
    That's all the space I have in this issue.  In future issues, we will
examine the process of installing the EMPLANT, dumping the ROMs,
partitioning the hard drive, setting up the EMPLANT, installing MAC DOS, and
eventually running applications.

 BRIEF DESCRIPTION

  Doom-like game

 AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

  Author:  BOMB company: Manyk (a new english company)

 COPY PROTECTION

  Yes 
  Not Hard drive installable
 
 MACHINE REQUIRED

  Amiga 1200/4000 (AGA only)

 RELEASE

  approximatively in one month

 WARNING

     This version of Fears is not the one released in shareware (the window
was small and the walls were green) but a TOTALLY NEW version.



     "Fears" will be the first Doom-like game for the AMIGA.  It is 
 developed by the BOMB team who made demos like Motion, Real and 
 ORIGIN (under the label Complex for the two latest).  The game is based on
 the algorithm used for Motion and is now 85 percent complete. Let's have 
 a closer look at Fears.

     First of all, you have to notice that Fears isn't like Wolfenstein but
 like Doom (the main difference between the two is that you have stairs in 
 Doom).  The technical specifications are incredible considering the 
 limitations due to the Amiga (no chunky mode).  Everything is mapped (not 
 only the walls) in 256 colors with up to 80 differents patterns.  The 
 differents monsters are animated (15 frames for each type of monster) and 
 you'll be able to blast them with 4 differents weapons (perhaps more 
 because the game isn't finish yet).  There was no music when I saw the 
 game but only the sounds of the weapons.
 
     The speed of the game is very good considering its specifications.  I 
 saw the game running on the Amiga of the programmer of the game (an 
 accelerated A1200 with Fast memory and a 50Mhz 68030).  Fears was nearly 
 one frame on this machine.  This will be different for owners of an 
 unaccelerated A1200: actually, the game is about 5/6 fps but the
 programmer told me that he was planning to double this speed (I don't 
 know if he'll succeed).  If you want to see yourself the speed of this 
 game you can have a look at the demo Motion (which won 3rd place at the 
 Party94) but be careful because the speed has been increased after the 
 release of Motion.  Moreover, the size of the display is resizeable to 
 accelerate the game.
 
     I played with Fears in a level created to test the speed and the look 
 of the game so I can't say if the global gameplay will be good.  I can 
 only say that the game looks great and that it was more than funny to play
 with it.  Imagine: you are walking in a strange corridor when suddenly two
 monster appear just in front of you.  Oops, that was the bad way, you 
 should turn back to the first floor and try an another stair.  OK, but  
 what do I do with two "happy" guys that are trying to kill me?  Blast 
 them with your gun and search for an hidden room filled with health 
 pack....(to be continued)
 
 You'll have 30 levels to complete before reaching the end of "Fears".

 Before leaving you, I just want to present to you the makers of "Fears".

                             SOME  BITS  of  TREASURE
                                by  Brian Strayer


    Wiping his sleeve across his face, Tom Armstrong hurried into the shade
 of the stone opening and leaned against it, taking quick, deep breaths. 
 Peering down the dusty, stone steps into the shadows, he thought over the 
 past few days and how fast the events had happened.
    He had just been helping out in the Archaeology Department for a month,
 when John had come in needing assistance on this trip. With evertone else
 out, he had had no choice.
    The plane to Cairo, the hot overland ride to Minya, and the offroad 
 trek to the dig had come in such quick succession that he hardly had time
 to think about what was next.
    Tom moved slowly down the steps and along the almost dark tunnel until 
 he reached his goal.
    The chamber was lit by a sole lantern which cast contorted, moving 
 shadows on the rock face from Jonathan Delacroix who was hunched over a 
 keyboard and a small stone tablet.
    The tablet had been found only yesterday, just before the laborers were
 released back to their village.  A smaller version of the tablet, which  
 John had acquired in the states, led them to this site and then to the  
 location inside of the larger one.
    Closer examination showed the tablet to be just like the smaller one, 
 and not a stone tablet at all.  It had the feel of stone, but was harder  
 than steel.  And this could not be filed, scratched, or dented.
    The encryptions on both tablets were multi-lingual, and enabled John 
 to translate these new, unknowm symbols.
    "I thought your laptop was out?" Tom said puffily as he came in and
 perched on a ledge.
    "Oh, " John replied, "I got this today at the marketplace. Gzeem the
 tanner got some off a camel caravan.  It's just a clone."
    "Ummm," mused Tom. "What have you got from the large tablet?"
 John sat up and ran his hand across his face and through his rumpled hair.
 "Well, these guys, whoever they were, had made many devices that were to 
 be distributed around the earth.  This was for some event in the far 
 future that was to happen or that they were to make happen.  All I know 
 of the devices is that they were a little larger than the tablets.
    I do have the location of a third tablet that has more.  Just give me a
 minute to run spatial coordinates for the chamber."
   "If you're running 3D visuals on that we'll be here all day," Tom 
 replied frowning.
   "No, I'm just doing the math.  We'll step it off," John said.
   They paced the numbers and came to a rock two feet high.
   "Hand me the doublejack, would you Tom?" John asked.
   A few quick blows showed a hollow inside half filled with sand and
 pebbles.  John stuck in his hand and removed another tablet.  It looked  
 just like the last, except for a large 'C' with two pointed bars near the

 bottom of the tablet.
  John brushed the sand from the letter with a puzzled frown.
  Tom straightened up with a growing recognition and his eyes wide.
  "I know where I've seen that before," he exclaimed all at once.
  "That's the Commodore Logo!"

 ...to be continued!

                         POLYESTER--A New Religion!
 
    Since the early days of humankind, man has looked to the stars, to the
 sea, and to the earth in wonder and amazement.  Such awesome beauty, all
 around.  The serenity of a perfectly calm lake, the power of a 
 thunderstorm in flatlands, the indredible ability of ants to organize 
 without even grunting at each other, and the crying of a tiny infant in a 
 wife's arm.
 
    And, since these early days and the ability to wonder at such things 
 came to be, so also did the ability to be curious about them.
 
    Why does a great light flash and a big boom sound sometimes when it
 rained?  Why is there a great ribbon of colour splashing across the sky 
 when it rains,and then immediately suns?  Why does a baby pop out of a 
 wife nine moons later after you boink her?
 
    Their puny intellects simply couldn't comprehend the facts. They 
 couldn't use the scientific method of empirical data gathering to prove 
 or disprove hypotheses.  They didn't have telescopes, they didn't have 
 Newton, or Einstein, or tunneling electron microscopes.
 
    This worried them.  For, being curious, they wouldn't stop wondering 
 about these things until they could understand them.  And this devotion 
 of mental power wasn't exactly helpful to their early crops. Great famines
 ensued.  Many, many friend died, and often, when they'd be staring up at 
 the sky wondering, they'd bump into each other annoyingly and feuds that 
 have lasted throguhout the centuries and beyond were started. (See 
 Atreides, House of, and Harkonnen, House of.)
 
    There was a great leader of the time, and his name was John.  Now, John
 was a very curious man. But, he was also stunningly wise.  Intelligent 
 beyond his years, and he knew that people bumping into each other and not 
 tending to their crops could never be helpful. He understood the need to 
 be curious, but he knew he had to do something about the dilemma his 
 people faced.
 
    So, one day when the Great John was playing with his fingertoys, he
 thought of a grand idea.
 
    The next afternoon, he called a following together and spread the word 
 the there was a Great Man in the sky, playing with them, controlling them 
 all as he would playtoys!  Everyone went away smiling, joking, and 
 laughing.  Of course! Why didn't they think of that!
 
    So everyone's curiosity was satisfied, except for a very few who 
 wondered how this Great Man came to be. Were there other even Greater Men
 controlling the Great Man? John quickly put a stop to these "anarchists" 
 by throwing them in the first dungeons, much to the surprise of the 
 imprisoned people, and the first censors were born. (See Government 
 Censorship of Free Thought)
 
    Many centuries later, after the now Not-So-Great John (his idea of the
 Great Man was good, and occupied his people, but his idea of imprisonment
 wasn't received too well, and he was quickly beheaded by angry mobs of
 fishermen who claimed John was Not-So-Wise after all.  Unfortunately, the
 Great Man theory stuck) was long gone and dead, another Great Curiosity
 struck the people.  Science, then a strangely quack-like profession, took
 over because of its odd ability to convince people that it could explain
 everything.  But, now that everyone thought it could explain everything,
 some asked how the Great Man came to be. (The anarchists were released
 after the death of John, and managed to spread their ideas before John's
 son took over. And this time they weren't so vocal about the whole 
 affair.)  Science delved deep into its misshaped imagination and decided 
 that the Great Man didn't exist after all.  Instead, Universal laws and 
 theories replaced the Great Man idea.  After all the confusion ended, the 
 curiosity of the people remained, and now the questions was not "How did 
 the Great Man come to be," but instead, "How the laws and theories came 
 to be."
 
    Science, by this point, had become so fed up with the people they 
 threw up their hands and, learning from the Great John's ideas and 
 thoughts, came up with a new cheap material called polyester to occupy 
 the people with something other than Great Curiosity (See "Oooh Lookit 
 the Pretty Colours.")  It turns out John was a Great Man after all.  Or at
 least his method of dealing with his subjects was.  His dungeons were just
 replaced with insane asylums this time around, and his Great Man theory 
 was replaced with polyester.  A main difference between the Great Man and 
 polyester, is that polyester can be worn.  Which makes it a much better 
 choice.
 
  And the people were happy..
 
  For the time being.

          @{i}@{bg fill}I Regret That I Have But One Life To Give For My Amiga @{ui}@{bg back}

    It's getting tougher and tougher to keep a bright and cheery 
 disposition.    

    After all, as I write this, we're just days away from the 10th month of
 Commodore's liquidation, and all we have to show for it are a load of
 promises, magazine articles promising a quick solution, and what seems 
 like a gigabyte of Usenet articles proclaiming that Company X has REALLY
 bought out Commodore!

    What has that meant for the Amiga community?  It was hardly growing at 
 a breakneck pace while Commodore was hanging by a thread, aside from 
 making inroads into Europe's game console market.  Now, of course, both 
 the user and the developer bases are eroding.

    At the same time, we're looking at new, seemingly bizarre products.  A
 "laptop" about the size of a 3000, Bring Your Own Motherboard.  A
 pseudo-clone in production with an astronomical price but capable of
 powering the VLab Motion non-linear videotape editing system.  And at 
 least 3 independent projects to replace the Amiga OS with something 
 similar.
 
    Certainly, these aren't signs of rejuvination, but of innovation-
 workarounds for problems that can't be solved in the conventional manner
 anymore.

    So, what is there to do?  Bail out of the Amiga market?  I've given it 
 a bit of thought myself.  Then it occurred to me-there is absolutely no 
 good reason to.  I don't rely on my computer for income, I rely on it for
 entertainment, and I'm getting that much.  Besides, the "other" computers
 will likely always be there for you later, so why not ride the storm out
 now and see where it leads?

    Clearly, those who DO rely on their machine for money are faced with
 serious quandries, and I feel for them, and understand when they switch 
 machines.  But that can't be helped.

    What does the future hold?  A huge challenge.  It can be argued that a
 new computer platform has not been successfully introduced to the mass 
 market in  over 10 years-if you define success by "The parent company 
 still exists", that would be the Macintosh.  Any new company is faced 
 with having to beat those odds.

    What's the key?  Software, of course.  The purchasing perception of the
 mass market is based on the availablility of software-usually a few catchy
 and popular titles.  I would submit that grabbing one major developer in 
 the business field would be sufficient.  MicroSoft would be a logical, but
 unsavory, choice.  Aldus/Adobe would be nice.  Novell wouldn't hurt.  A 
 few others would fit the bill-with their software suite ported to the 
 Amiga, it would appear to be a "serious" contender.

    On the other side of the coin, winning the consideration of a major 
 software publisher is critical.  Electronic Arts would be the most logical
 choice-their sales figures are absolutely staggering, and they would bring
 some of the "hottest multimedia titles", especially through Origin.

    CEI, Commodore UK, and whoever else thinks they want a shot need to 
 court these players now, or the Amiga may be dead-on-rearrival.

                          From BullFrog Software
 
    Sim City lovers, this is a MUST-HAVE game!  The game is very fun, and 
 takes a lot of time to play.  The object of the game is to build a theme
 park.  The game has many options such as adding guards, chickens 
 (Chickens? -Josh) to entertain the visitors, and much more!  You can build
 many rides such as a roller coaster, ghost house, merry go round and more,
 you can even build shops that sell ice cream, french fries, and other 
 items.  This game will keep you busy for a very long time, in fact, this 
 is pure addiction: once you play you can't stop!

    Very nice plane game, the flight panels are identical to a plane.  Five
 on the PC's.  I recommend you have at least 2 meg RAM to play it well.
 All through you can adjust the screen to reduce its size, which will make
 the game go faster.  You are basically in a plane with another person, who
 controls something else.  The game is fun, with detailed bridges, tanks 
 and planes.  This makes a very good game.  The sound is pretty good, but 
 while flying the shooting noise is annoying.

    Another plane game, (if you forget that this one is a more like a plane
 in space -Josh) but this one is really good, I love the music and
 graphics, this game gets the Editors Choice!  The game is very fun, the 
 missions are good enough to keep you coming back for more.
