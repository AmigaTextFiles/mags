	@{"b"}Name@{"ub"}	PowerCache v37.115 
	Description	Disk caching system 
	Author	Michael Berg 
	Price	Shareware ($20) 
	System Requirements	OS2.0 (OS3.0+ recommended)   

As you may have guessed, this is a program to speed up disk operations, something which is very useful to most users. PowerCache will cache any available device, so floppies can be cached as well as hard disks.  

Installation is easy - it is possible to execute an Installer script as well as an AmigaDOS script from the supplied guide, which also explains how to install manually. The Amigaguide is very helpful, explaining all about caches, etc. It seems especially targetted towards beginners, for example, it gives a list of the CPUs in different Amiga models so you know which version of the program to use (000, 020, 030 and 040 are all provided).   

When running, disk operations are of course faster. It is especially nice when opening drawers (whether in Workbench, a file requester or whatever) to have them display very quickly, without the disk having to be read.  

PowerCache is shareware - the unregistered version quits after  30 minutes, and pops up an 'About' requester when it starts.  

All in all, a very useful program. If you haven't already got a disk caching program - get this.
