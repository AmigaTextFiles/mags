@{"b"}Getting Hold of DoubleClick!@{"ub"}  

DoubleClick is available from various sources now...   
    	
    @{"b"}Aminet@{"ub"} - both html and amigaguide versions will be uploaded to docs/mags as soon as possible, @{"b"}under the name 'DCx_Guide.lha' and 'DCx_HTML.lha', where x is the issue number@{"ub"}, so check those recent lists! The html versions will from now on need a web browser (but  just download a freeware one). Also, the amigaguide version on aminet requires you to decompress onto hard disk; if you only have a floppy drive, then get the disk version. 
    	
    @{" " link "DC5_Guide1:Mag5_Guide/SUBS.GUIDE/MAIN"} @{"b"}Subscription@{"ub"} - the best way for readers without internet access. Again, from now on the full/html version really requires a web browser, but there's also  the guide version needing just WB2. 
    	
    @{"b"}@{" " link "DC5_Guide1:Mag5_Guide/TI_BBS.GUIDE/MAIN"} Transmission Impossible BBS@{"ub"} - DMS files of both versions will be available here! 
    	
    @{"b"}CD ROM@{"ub"} - It ought to find its way onto the Aminet CDs of course, and we may send them in for AF/CU CoverCDs, but this takes time, and the issues will be out of date by a few months at  least. 
    	
    @{"b"}PD Libraries@{"ub"} - of course may get hold of it. In particular, Stephen will probably send copies to @{"b"}Amicom PD@{"ub"}. 
    	
    @{"b"}Other People@{"ub"} - Remember that DC is completely freeware, so feel free to copy it to all your contacts, and spread it everywhere!
