This demo starts off with some 3D effects, but contains a lot of 2D effects too, which makes a change from those demos with nothing but 3D. You've seen one rotating 3D texture mapped blob, you've seen them all...  

There are two rotating tunnel sections, the first one is okay,  but the later one has much better lighting on the walls; the colour makes all the difference, it seems.  

Plenty of 2D effects which are rather difficult to describe; wierd shapes spinning around and distorting.  

There's a nice section which show some water, with ripples and  lighting/reflection, complete with seagull noises! Then you see a 3D dolphin swimming about.  

All in all, a good demo. Nothing individually makes it stand out, but all the bits together make a demo worth watching.
