@{"b"}Doubleclick Issue 5 Editorial@{"ub"}  

Hello Readers,  

Well,   I  hope that you found Doubleclick!  Issue 4 to  be  well  put together,  informative,  interesting, and most importantly, FUN! If it wasn't,  and you didn't, then why are you bothering reading this then? It must have been good enough for you to buy it a second time.  

Anyway (Sorry Mark),  on with the show.  Loads in the mag this time  - maybe even a free game and / or Christmas Module - we will have to see how  much  disk  space we have left.  Look out for our regular  slots, with  the HTML Tutorial,  and the excellent "How to write a Doom Clone (Sort  of),   as well as Pit Stop from me,  and of course  my  monthly Public  Domain Software List.  All this and the usual Reviews,   News, Jokes,  Stories, Song Lyrics, you name it, we've got it (wasn't that a catchphrase  from  an  advert? Answers on  a  postcard  to  the  usual address.)  

Still have not cracked this Lottery,  so the MicroniK Infinitiv  Tower will just have to wait for a while.  Just have to do with what I  have just now.  Maybe buying a CD ROM soon, but I have been saying that for the last 6 months,  so we shall wait and see. PowerPC card may also be on  the cards,  if it ever gets released!  (See later in Editorial for answer).  

Flicking  through  the  latest   issue  of  Amiga  Format  this  month (September),  I notice that in Net Corner (Page 10), a site devoted to the film The Full Monty.  The film is all about some guys who try  and raise money by stripping in Clubs etc up and down the country.  I have not seen it,  but I have seen clips on The Movie Show on Sky.  Looks a bit  of a laugh.  Maybe some of the more talented of you readers could write  in  with Reviews of films,  and we could have our own  resident Barry  Norman.  And Why Not? Back to the website.  It has full  motion video clips,  audio bites,  as well as stills from the movie, although I  do not know how clean (in a smutty sense)  they are.  Find out  for yourself  at http://www.fullmonty.co.uk where are will be revealed  as it were!  There is also a competition where you send in nude photos of yourself,  uploaded to the site I would imagine. Don't ask me what the prize is though!  

Big  Bad  Bold Bill strikes again.  Not content with being the richest man in the world,  he has now bought a 7% share in Apple,  although it is  non  voting,  and has dropped all his lawsuits against them,   and conversely against him.  How long will it be before he buys over Apple lock,  stock & barrel.  Then all he has to do is buy over IBM,   which means he will effectively be richer than God!  I actually watched  the Mac Expo in question on a Computing show on Sky News,  and yes,  there jeers and boos a plenty,  let me tell you.  Steve Jobs,  Co-founder of Apple,  and thought by many to be a guiding light in their sucess, was heckled by most of the crowd when he annoced the Microsoft deal to the masses.  I was waiting for tins of fruit to be thrown when Bill  Gates appeared on the video screen behind, looking like the cat that had got the cream, as is his usual pose.  

You  may notice that I know have an E-Mail address.  This is not  mine personally,  but you can still use it to send me stuff for the mag, or just to have a chat,  but if it just for a chat,  then please give  me your  snail mail address.  You can send me Lha archives  etc  to  this address,  as long as they are not over 700K in size,  as that  is  the biggest  amount that the crappy CrossDOS can handle  on  an  Amiga  PC Formatted disk.  

Not long before my brother goes to University, so maybe I will have an E-Mail address which you rich modem owning readers can use to send  me articles  for  the  mag (didn't I just say that!).   Of  course,   all entries can still be sent to me via the post,  and I will ensure  that they  receive the proper attention.  (Afternote - I now have  Internet access and an E-Mail,  as you may notice from the heading at  the  top of the page, and the last paragraph!)  

This  month  should see that start of my Personal Paint Tutorial.   It should  run  for  a  few  issues,  with an ever  expanding  Amigaguide document,  which will highlight lots of different qualities of PPaint. To  start off,  it will be very basic,  but will get more involved  as time  goes on.  If there are any points that people want me to explore fully, then please write to me, and I shall see what I can do.  

Got  the  Xmas issue of AF today (Thursday,  20 November).  Will  have writers  cramp entering all the competitions in this issue,  and  will probably  run out postcards before I run out of money  to  post  them! When AF100 ran all their compos,  I spent about £3-£4 on postage,   on second  class stanps.  This was offset by the amount I  won  on  these competitions  (absolutely  sod  all  except  loads  of  leaflets  from companies  which were along the line of "Sorry you  did  not  win  the recent giveaway, by never fear, you have been selected, as one of only a  few to buy this product at the bargaini giveaway price of only £20 dearer than we are currently advertising it in the magazines!".   Most of  these  letters are now festering in my bin,  along with old  apple cores, and sweetie wrappers.  Highlights  in  the Xmas AF are the arrival of the PowerPC  board  (at last),   the  Power UP!  from Phase 5 / Cyberstorm.   I  was  actually talking  to an IBM employee today,  and he had not even heard  of  the Amiga,  and did not have much idea what all this PowerPC stuff was all about.  If he didn't know,  what chance have we got!  he probably just made tea or something - who knows?  

Read  with  interest  the review for the great!?  game  Nemeses  which scored  highly  in the fact that there was some graphics,   a  bit  of sound,  not much addiction, but this was offset by the great (well not so  great)   playability.  Overall it was "nothing to  get  worked  up about", scoring a massive 35%!   Must ask Santa for that one!   Street Racer  came a close second at 45%,  which puzzled me,  as the  overall verdict said it had no gameplay,  but one of the highest marks was for playability.  Who writes these reviews? No we should not mock,  as  it is still the magazine everybody tries to beat (and fails).  

Workbench  4 looks to be released next year,  hopefully.   Maybe  they will  think  of some good thins to add like being able to  read  PNGS, JPEGS,   GIFS etc as standard,  without having to use datatypes,   and special viewers,  and the likes. I have had loads of trouble trying to get  my  copy of Dopus4 to read PNG's,  which is what I use PPaint  to save  in.   Cannot  be done easily but I have found  a  temporary  way around it,  but all my PNG files must end in .PNG which is a pain if I download any from the 'Net,  as I will have to rename them to look  at them via Dopus4.  I could use Dopus5,  but I don't like it as much  as Dopus4.  I have spent ages getting my Config file just right,   and  I like it the way it is!  

Well,  must go and look at the Reader Ads section and see if there  is any  penpals  that I will write to.  Oops,  only one  listed,   and  I already write to him (Shane Hassam).  If anyone wants to swap PD  etc, then just drop me a letter, and a disk, and I shall send them my disk. I  already have about 15 penpals all over the world - would  you  like to be added to the list?  

I must remeber and send Xmas Greetings to all the following people, some of which will read this, some who won't, and some who may read this, but then how will I know!?  

Here goes, in no particular order:  

Mark  Harman  (of  course - maybe we can meet up  in  1998!),   Andrew Whiteley,  Ragnar Fyri,  Jamie Percival,  Ahmed H S,  Suzi  Henderson, Nikola Tomic,  Paul Lathwell, Simon Brown, Roy Musson, Andrew Jackson, Ian  Charles  Fyvie,   Geoff Aitken,  Jock  Ross,   Andrew  and  Leeze MacGlauchlin,  Monica Thirwell, Nick Abott, Jody Wilkes, Amicom Public Domain,  Graham Sheilds, Barry Briceland, All At Pentrisoft, Genocide, Team  17 Software,  S & S Computer Supplies,  Paul Gribben (Mark  will tell  all about him!  (IRC?)),  Graeme Sandiford,  All others at Amiga Format,   Suzanne MacKirdy (about 22 now)  who used live  in  Glenacre Drive,  Largs, who moved to Milton Keynes when she was about 13 or 14, and  is  now  of unknown whereabouts - (If you are reading  this,   or someone  who knows her is reading this ,  then please get in  touch!), All  at  CU  Amiga,   Santa,  the tooth fairy,  and  Sasquatch,   Paul Stevenson,   Mervyn  Weir,  Julie Crawford,   Graeme  McKee,   All  at Lindsay's  Newsagent,  All my paper round customers (I  hope  the  new paperboy  next year is as good as I was over the last  8!),   All  the Doubleclick!  Readers,  old and new, for supporting us over the last 4 issues,  and hope that the next 10 are as good,  if not better,  Minky the  cat!,   All  the  rest at Largs PO Sorting Office  that  know  me (practically all of them!),  Tara the dog!, David Csmoa, all my Garage customers,  anyone that I have written to over the last year, and just about  anyone else that know's me,  and all the people  that  I  would like  to  know,  but don't (The man that writes the cheques at Camelot would  be top of the list!)  - A very Merry Xmas and a Happy New  Year to you,  one and all!  Hope that I hear from you all in 1998!  I think that's about everybody covered!  

One  last thing before I go - can anyone help me with a copy of a JAVA compiler for the Amiga,  so that I can use Java scripts written  on  a UNIX  or  IBM on my Amiga.  I know that you can get them,  as  I  have heard they are on the Aminet, but I have not used them for myself.  
	----------------------------------------
 Not a lot more to say, except have a great Christmas, and a very drunk New Year.  Hope 1998 goes as well for you as I hope it does for me.  

Thanks for watching.  See you in Issue 6, sometime in 1998!    

Just  a  small reminder - it is my 22nd Birthday on the 14th  January, so any presents,  disks,  cards, date proposals (female only please!), chocolates,   although none with rat poison,  and just about  anything else you want to send,  will greatly be appreciated.  I may be getting old  now,   but  I  still know what end of a CD Rom  to  plug  into  a computer (Hint for a present!).
