Subject:  Gateway 2000 speech transcript 
From: jtv@xs4all.nl (Jeroen T. Vermeulen) 
Date: 7-23-97 
Newsgroup: comp.sys.amiga.misc 
 
For some reason, a lot of what was said by Gateway's Jim Taylor at the WOA still 
hasn't  made it to all those who are interested.  A real pity, since it explains 
and answers a lot that is being discussed here by the usual pessimists. 
 
One  of  the  most  notable items is the fact that Gateway themselves had little 
notion of what was going on with the Amiga before they bought it, but it was the 
enthusiastic  user  community (and other assorted miracles) that made them think 
again. 
 
All  this  can be heard on the MPEG audio samples published on Amiga Computing's 
Web   site   (http://www.idg.co.uk/amigacomp/,   look  under  Stuff).   However, 
downloading  them  takes ages and playing them eats a lot of CPU cycles.  So for 
those  of you who didn't get to hear the samples, here's a transcript of what is 
said in them. 
 
DISCLAIMER  - I don't speak for anyone.  This transcript is not official, it has 
not  been  acknowledged or endorsed (or even read AFAIK) by any of the speakers, 
and  punctuation  is  my  own.   Transcribing speeches necessarily involves some 
guesswork,  so  it's  likely that the text will deviate in some points from what 
was really said.  Typos are also unavoidable since I mostly wrote this at night. 
Since  the  samples  don't always overlap, I also have no way of knowing whether 
anything else was said inbetween samples. 
 
Don't use for medical purposes or on live animals.  Do not inhale.  Ingest after 
reading.  Good luck, 007. 
 
Whatever  the weaknesses in my own transcription may be, I think that posting it 
would  do  more  good at this point than keeping it to myself.  I've tried to be 
conservative  in my guesses, so some text is marked as doubtful [word ?], either 
inserted  or deleted [word], annotated <like this, ed.;, or added to describe 
other sounds <mumbles:  yeah right;.  Where speakers correct themselves, I've 
not  transcribed  the  mistake  and  correction  literally  but incorporated the 
correction in the original sentence directly. 
 
 
START OF TRANSCRIPT 
 
 
Dr. James Taylor, Senior VP Global Marketing Gateway 2000 Incorporated: 
 
 
Hello Amiga people! 
 
crowd: hello etc. 
 
In my country when you say hello they say "Hi Jim!" 
 
crowd: Hi Jim! 
 
(chuckles) 
 
I  really  am  pleased  to  be  here today, er, as you all know Gateway 2000 has 
agreed  and has completed the transaction to acquire Amiga and it is a wonderful 
opportunity  for  Gateway  2000 and we hope that for the world of Amiga it turns 
out  to  be  just  as rewarding.  I would like to say on rumours of this meeting 
today, the US share price of Gateway 2000 rose 7.50 dollars yesterday so... 
 
I  felt what I'd do though is spend a few minutes talking about Gateway, because 
I  think that we can all become friends going forward and I think it's important 
for  you  to  understand  who  we  are  as  a  company,  and hopefully gain some 
confidence  in  the  kind  of  organization that Petro and the Amiga people have 
chosen  to  associate  themselves  with,  because  in some ways we are as deeply 
embedded  in the culture of computing as Amiga and its predecessors in Commodore 
all  the  way  back  into  the seventies when these ideas were being founded and 
being built with little cassette tapes on desktops all over the world. 
 
Gateway  was founded by a man named Ted Waitt, his partner Mike Hammond, and his 
brother  in 1985 in the American city of Sioux City, Iowa.  Sioux City is a city 
of  about  100,000  people,  and  at the time was the last vestment of the great 
American  cattle  industry.  It was a deteriorating place of stockyards, you may 
remember those of you at least my age, the characterization of American industry 
in  the  late  seventies  and the early eighties as being in the tank, unable to 
compete,  and  filled  with what they called "rust balls".  Well, Sioux City was 
certainly   one  of  the  capitals  of  the  rust  ball.   Ted  borrowed  10,000 
dollars--actually  the  truth is he borrowed 15,000 dollars from his grandmother 
in order to borrow 10,000 dollars from a bank; his grandmother put up a [time ?] 
15,000  [cd  ?]  to  guarantee  a  10,000  dollar  loan--and  went into business 
supporting Texas Instruments' efforts to distribute PCs in the midwest. 
 
Very  shortly  thereafter  Texas Instruments decided to exit the PC business and 
Ted  was offered an opportunity to convert a lot of Texas Instruments warranties 
to  cash,  and  he  used  that  money  to  buy  some  chips  from a weak US chip 
manufacturer  called  Intel that was launching a new product called the 386, and 
assembled   those   computers   in   the  early  days--Ted,  Mike,  his  sister, 
everybody--by hand, and offered them for sale through magazines. 
 
I will tell you something; that according to the historical research we've done, 
in  that year there were 700 direct-mail PC companies in the United States.  All 
the value (with the exception of this one out of Austin, like, I can never think 
of  the one out of Austin, it is er...  Dulk, Dul, Del -- Dell company), all the 
value of all the other companies put together does not equal our revenues in the 
1996 fiscal year. 
 
Because  Ted  did something from the very beginning that was a revolution in the 
PC  business:   He  built a product from the customer in, rather [than] from the 
technology out.  And from the very beginning we were founded on the idea that we 
wanted to be the leading marketer of personal computer products in the world.  I 
mean, you can't imagine what it'd be like to be [in] a little John in the middle 
of nowhere and say, and Ted'd have a ponytail, he was 23, and he says "I'm going 
to be the leading manufacturer of personal computer products in the world".  And 
this would be the sort of a laughable statement I would get if I was to say "I'm 
going to Hollywood and become a star". 
 
It wasn't likely--and yet we believe it's actually taking place. 
 
It's  happening because of what we think about ourselves as an organization, how 
we  run  the  business.   We  are  perhaps the flattest large corporation in the 
world.   There's  about  10,000 people in the world of Gateway today and there's 
one chairman, Ted, there's a president, Rick Snyder, there's about 7 senior vice 
presidents,  there's  a  dozen  or so vice presidents and then there's everybody 
else.   We run the business in such a way that everybody sharing a common set of 
values about the relationship we want to have with the customers and each other, 
prohibits  the  need, or limits the need, for a lot of supervisors, for a lot of 
people  running  around  telling  other  people  what to do.  And as a result we 
remain  very  flat  relative  to our market size, and as a result we remain very 
profitable,  and  we remain able to move, in an organization as large as we are, 
against  the speed of technology.  When P2 <Intel's Pentium II processor, ed; 
was  launched  on  tuesday  of  last  week,  by  the  time  Intel  finished  the 
announcement we'd sold 1300 systems. 
 
When  MMX  went  on  sale  in  January  with  a  9  o'clock  press conference in 
[telannounce  ?],  we announced at 10 o'clock that we were shipping MMX.  We are 
able  to  respond  very  very  quickly to emerging market expectations, emerging 
technology,  emerging  human  resources  expectation, and emerging opportunities 
like   the   opportunity  represented  by  the  <searches  for  words;  Amiga 
opportunity.   We  believe  in  respect,  caring, teamwork; we believe in common 
sense,  we  believe  in  aggressiveness, we believe in honesty and we believe in 
efficiency, and we believe in having fun. 
 
I've  noticed that at least on the last count, we share something with the Amiga 
world right out of the box.  This is a technology that is about not just working 
with computers but having fun with computers, making computers make a difference 
in  people's  lives.   Our  marketing  position--we used to pray silicon prayers 
describing   ourselves,  because  what  we're  interested  in  doing  is  making 
technologies   more  accessible  to  the  ordinary  needs  of  ordinary  people. 
Sometimes   I  like  to  say  that  what  our  business  really  is,  is  taking 
extraordinary  technologies  and  making  them  do very ordinary things, so that 
people can do more and more, and more better things with their lives. 
 
Our  mission  as  a  company  is to profitably grow our business faster than our 
competition by better understanding and serving the desires of our customers and 
marketing  high-value  products  directly  to  our  customers.   And there is no 
company  in  the  world  that  fits  this  mission better than Amiga.  And quite 
frankly there is no company in the world that we are more happy to partner with, 
and  to  become  next  to,  than  Amiga.   We are, as you may be aware, a global 
company  now.   We  have  manufacturing  in  the  US in Sioux City; Sioux Falls; 
Hampton,  Virginia,  we  have a large marketing center in Kansas City, we have a 
manufacturing  facility  (a  very  large manufacturing facility) in Ireland.  We 
have manufacturing now in Malacca, Malaysia.  We have a very large operation now 
in  Tokyo,  in  fact  [Asai  Shibbo?] recently wrote that Gateway is the fastest 
corporate  startup  in  the  history of Japan.  We grew 389% our first year, and 
from  zero grossed 250 million dollars.  In fact, last week on the launch of P2, 
I  think  our  Japanese  people  were  ecstatic:   Sales in Japan on May the 8th 
exceeded the sales of Gateway throughout all of Europe. 
 
We  are  a desktop and portable manufacturer.  We [are] probably now lead the US 
in  terms  of  desktop  sales to various kinds of categories in the home market. 
Nielsen  and IEC just announced that we are now the #1 brand in the US for brand 
loyalty  (we just passed Apple), and we [have ?] now go back in the top [tier in 
?] service and delivery. 
 
We  are also an innovator.  We invented and launched the PCTV last year with our 
Destination  line.  This is a product that puts the tuner on the motherboard and 
converts  very  large  VTAs  into functional televisions while retaining all the 
capacities  of  computing.   We  are  the  time-to-market  value  leader  in new 
technologies as well as product innovations that serve the customer's needs.  We 
currently  have  just under 8% of the US desktop market, five billion dollars in 
revenue  last year, 1.9 million units last year, a 43% increase on year-on-year, 
and I just saw the numbers for the first quarter 19--[] 
 
going on to next sample 
 
[]--We  grew  in  the home market 55% and in the corporate and enterprise market 
26%.  Our profits last year were 251 million dollars (that's rounded), we have a 
little  over  500  million dollars in the bank, and we have a total last year of 
about 800 million dollars in non-US sales and we expect to exceed that number by 
a very large percentage this year. 
 
It  wasn't hard for us to decide to talk to Amiga, and talk about Amiga, because 
one  of  the bedrocks of the Gateway customer relationship has always been being 
next  to the people who are the most enthusiastic users in the world.  Gateway's 
marketing  strategy--and  I  can  speak to this with some knowledge, I will have 
difficulty answering technology questions but I do understand what our consumers 
are  looking for--is the first [] of a country we enter into, to be what we call 
the  enthusiasts:   People  who  are given to using computers as a part of their 
life  on a daily basis.  People for whom being involved in the computer world is 
a  part  of  their self-esteem.  People for whom computers have become a natural 
part of what it means to be alive today. 
 
Once  we  have  established ourselves in responding to a country's needs in that 
category  we  then  begin  to  look at opportunities in the generalized consumer 
market  or  the  enterprise  market,  the  corporate  market,  the institutional 
markets.   But  the cornerstone of the company has always been, and will remain, 
relationships  with  enthusiasts.  And another point of similarity is--and I can 
tell you we've gotten thousands of letters now, thousands of letters, from Amiga 
enthusiasts that run the gamma from "Oh boy, are we glad you guys got it" to "Oh 
boy, you screwed us up, I will kill you". 
 
laughter 
 
[]! I wanna know who wrote that []! 
 
more laughter 
 
Now  we've completed the transaction through the German bankruptcy court; it has 
now  been  approved by the German regulatory council.  We are not disclosing the 
terms  of  the  transaction but I would like you to know that the transaction is 
completed.   The  parent  corporate  name  of Amiga will be Amiga International, 
which  we enlisted as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gateway.  It will continue to 
run  as  an  autonomous company providing services, products, and development to 
the Amiga community.  We acquired all the aspects of Amiga and that included the 
inventory,  the  trademarks,  the  operating  system,  the hardware designs, the 
intellectual  property.  But what we really acquired, what we found we acquired, 
I think what we were surprised we acquired, was the World of Amiga. 
 
And  I  spent of a lot of time studying this, so I want to take a minute just to 
say  something.   It is clear that without you people, we would have had nothing 
to acquire.  So the first obligation of Gateway 2000 is to say thank you.  It is 
the  Amiga  community that has kept this brand and this OS and this product line 
and  this  concept  alive  without  the  support  of  strong corporate financial 
backing,  without  the support of a wild and competitive advertising scheme, and 
without a lot of things.  It is the belief in the OS and the belief in the value 
of  these  products  in the world of computing that has kept this product alive. 
So  Gateway  2000  would  like to say:  Thank you guys very much because without 
you, there'd be no Amiga. 
 
Before  I  turn  it over to Petro I'ld like to introduce my two colleagues here. 
They'll  be  here all the next couple of days.  They'll be happy to talk to you. 
Steve  Johns is our head of corporate development.  Stand up Steve, so I can see 
you! 
 
 
STEVE:   I'm  going to receive all the thousands and thousands of letters, so if 
there's any [] you know I'm working on it; 
 
Jim laughs, then resumes: 
 
And  Steve  Braddocks,  who is also part of the corporate development department 
and  has  been  the  lead  guy in handling the details of the acquisition, so on 
behalf  of  Gateway  2000 again thank you very much, it's a pleasure to be here, 
and it's a special pleasure to introduce my new friend Petro. 
 
Petro: Thank you, Jim 
 
 
Petro Tyschtschenko, CEO of Amiga International: 
 
joking  to Jim, barely audible:; [...  I?] know already our new goals for Amiga, 
all the figures that you presented, and our next goal. 
 
Jim laughs, says something like "kept [?]"; 
 
Ladies  and Gentlemen, distinguished guests:  I'm looking around here, and I see 
a  lot  of people which I know.  People who have long experience with the Amiga, 
and  people which supported Amiga and supported today as well.  It is nice to me 
to  see  that  the  Amiga platform is gifted by a community of competent people. 
These  strengths  are  going to be of critical importance for the success of the 
plans of Amiga International, which I am going to explain [to] you later. 
 
Anyway,  I'm very happy to see you and I would like to welcome you to this press 
event.   I  believe  there  is a bright future for Amiga International, a bright 
future  for  all  of us.  Let me explain a few details of importance so that you 
can  have  a  better  understanding  of what has happened to Amiga since the old 
Commodore  days.   Escom  acquired  Amiga  in  april 1995.  During this time, an 
effort  was  made  to  revitalize  the  Amiga  market.  However, Escom went into 
financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy on [the] 15th of July, 1996. 
 
During  this time, an effort was made to develop products.  But due to financial 
difficulties,  there  has  not  been  any  signific[ant]  amount  of new product 
development  by  Amiga over the past couple of years.  [Those] are facts.  Since 
filing  for bankruptcy we have been trying to keep the marketplace alive through 
inventory  sales  by  the Trust.  However, it has truly been the Amiga community 
that  has  kept  Amiga  alive through the development of products based on newer 
technology and software applications development. 
 
Now that Amiga is owned by a successful company, Gateway 2000, there is a bright 
future.   Gateway  2000,  we  just  learned  (and  we  know),  is  a  solid  and 
well-established  in  the computer industry.  Gateway 2000 has consistently been 
honoured with awards for products and service.  Gateway 2000 is a bright partner 
to  give  Amiga  new  life  and  energy for the future.  Amiga International was 
formed  as  a  US-based  company  in  March  1997 to acquire the assets of Amiga 
Technology GmbH.  Amiga International will operate, as Jim already mentioned, as 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gateway 2000. 
 
Over  the  past  months  we  have  been  very  busy  finalizing  the  exhibition 
[/acquisition?]  together  with  Steve,  and  Keith,  performing  due diligence, 
setting  up  operations  in  Germany  and  communicating  with  you,  ladies and 
gentlemen,  the  Amiga  community.   We have a new office in Langen, next to the 
Frankfurt airport, and I'm happy to report to you that we are operational again. 
In   Langen  we  have  three  people  handling  sales,  marketing,  and  general 
administration.  We will be running in the beginning of June.  Since early April 
we  have  four  employees  in Braunschweig that are taking care of logistics and 
warehousing, order processing, and customer support, and, you maybe noticed this 
already,  Internet  support  as well; and technical service.  Finally, we are in 
the  process  [of]  identifying an individual to manage new product development, 
which is so important, and R&D. 
 
What are we going to concentrate on?  We have to implement our strategy.  First, 
supporting  the existing Amiga community.  Second, leveraging the existing Amiga 
technology through broad licensing.  Third, assisting in developing new products 
based on open standards to the home computer and video graphic market. 
 
Ladies  and  gentlemen,  how  will we support the community, that has kept Amiga 
alive?   Through  conventions, press conferences, via the Internet, meetings and 
all  useful  initiatives  coming  from the Amiga community (I've already been to 
conventions  in  Germany  and  in  Sweden,  and will entertain any suggestions); 
continuing,  of  course,  to  sell  [through  the distributor?] network which is 
existing  and  which  has  supported the Amiga; working together with developers 
through  concepts  such  as the Open Amiga Initiative, that is being formed with 
the support of many [of] prominent names in the Amiga community. 
 
The  basic  of  success in this project is to work together with partners and to 
define  a  common  path of development.  The Amiga market cannot afford a split, 
ladies and gentlemen.  We must go together in one direction.  For us to keep the 
market  alive  is  necessary  to  assist  many  companies in developing products 
through  broad  licensing.   Our  licensing policy will be very open, broad, and 
focused on licensing the standard OS, chipset, and trademarks. 
 
Also,  licensing  will  alllow the Amiga to be spread to many different embedded 
applications  and  fields  such  as  medical  solutions,  military applications, 
fitness  equipment,  irrigation  systems, and kiosk terminals.  Of course we are 
looking  for  new  partners  through  licensing and focused R&D managed by Amiga 
International.  We plan to assist the marketplace in developing new products for 
the  Amiga.   We  are currently exploring many of the possible new products that 
have  been  suggested  including such things as operating system upgrade and new 
hardware platform.  We would like to keep the procedure, not complicated, but as 
simple as possible.  Simple as myself. 
 
We  need  to talk with technology companies from the Amiga business and exchange 
knowhow.   Very  important.   It is also important that we explore an open Amiga 
platform, use industry standard components to make it cheaper to produce, faster 
to develop, and easier to operate. 
 
These  things,  ladies and gentlemen, need to happen very quickly--but in a very 
managed  fashion.  With this strategy and the support of the Amiga community and 
Gateway 2000, we are convinced there is a bright future for the Amiga. 
 
That,  ladies  and  gentlemen, concludes our presentation for today.  Jim Taylor 
and  myself  are  now ready for questions and answers, and we hope that tomorrow 
you will all enjoy the fair and visit our booth.  Thank you very much. 
 
 
Q1:   []  We  appreciate Gateway buying us, very much so, but we kind of wonder, 
what  does  Gateway  get  out  of  this?   What  did  you achieve by buying this 
[elaborate?] kind of [electric?] gizmo? 
 
Jim:   We believe that Amiga can be one of the most important computer companies 
in the world, to the extent that if it succeeds, we succeed.  I mean, this is an 
important investment for us from the point of view of the future of Gateway.  We 
believe  that this is a very, very important market.  We believe in a multimedia 
computing  future.   We  believe  that  we  are very close to the day when every 
household  will  be its own broadcast center, its own Internet site, its own Web 
site,  its  own  communicating  entity;  and  certainly  Amiga represents a very 
important technology in that venue. 
 
Q2:   So,  were  you  trying  to  diversify  Gateway's  holdings,  er, Gateway's 
credentials? 
 
Jim:   Gateway  would  avoid  the  use  of  words  that  would  cause  us  to be 
characterized  the  ways  that  other  corporations are characterized.  We don't 
speak of ourselves as being "diverse".  We speak of ourselves as being a company 
that  is  so  close  to the customer that we know what they want, and we know an 
awful lot of customers want Amiga. 
 
Q3:   Do  you  guys  intend  to  benefit from the acquisition of this technology 
beyond simply the [acquisition?] of Amiga Technologies? 
 
Jim:   I  would be a fool to say no.  I can't believe that we won't benefit from 
this  technology.   How we will benefit still remains to be seen, it's not clear 
to  us  how  that  will  work out--but, I mean, you guys know, this is some good 
stuff!  So we... 
 
Q4:   So  you  think  there's  any possibility of Gateway products in the future 
benefiting from the technology you bought [through?] using parts of it? 
 
Jim:  Like I said, I can't imagine that we won't benefit from the technology. 
 
[We  guess?] it's very important for the Amiga community to recognize something, 
and  I'll  say  it  one  more  time because, those of you in the press:  I would 
really  like  the word to get out.  We...  Petro has the opportunity to sit down 
and take a hard look at what it takes to make Amiga "go" in the real world.  And 
we  need to give him the room to do that.  Gateway is prepared to be patient and 
let  the  company  develop.   As  I  said,  we've  owned it for (what?  a little 
over...)  a  month  or, a couple of days...  <interjected suggestions; Ninety 
seconds...   Twenty  minutes,  whatever.  And we are here communicating with the 
Amiga community at the very first possible venue to do so, but we want you to be 
patient  with  Petro  because  the  answer to these questions lies more with the 
Amiga  people  than  it lies with the Gateway people, and I think that's a thing 
you've  got  to  understand.   We believe in Amiga.  We believe in Gateway.  But 
Amiga is Petro's destiny, [and] we're here to help. 
 
Now  I  know  everybody in the room has heard about [] corporate [] help, but we 
hope that we are benign in our processes. 
 
Q5:   [] Amiga [] in Brussel <Flemish name of Brussels, ed;.  Petro, you said 
that  Amiga  could  not  afford  to  go  in more than one direction, I mean on a 
hardware  point  of view.  [] But [] Phase 5 has already announced that they are 
launching  next  month  their  PowerPC  product.   PIOS  has a working prototype 
(without  software  for  the  moment).   There  are already quite some products. 
MacroSystem  has  a  DraCo  running for quite a time now.  What are you going to 
choose?  Is it Phase 5 is going to be the standard or... 
 
Petro:   Both  we'll  choose!  Because the one direction we would like to go, is 
our  operating  system.   This  is  the  line,  this is the streamline.  We will 
license  them whatever they need, because there is a brilliant technology there, 
what  they  develop.   Phase  5 is great.  I visited them 3 weeks ago, Wolfgang, 
Gehr[],  so  we  had a perfect meeting and we know exactly in which direction we 
go.   This is one direction.  What I don't like to have is that we have a war in 
our  community.   Everybody's  going  in another direction, and doing his own... 
cooks  his own cup of tea or whatever.  But there is only one Amiga.  And we are 
the  roof,  and you can develop, and we will support it, and we will license it. 
Whatever you need--but under one roof, in one direction. 
 
Q5:   ...And  always  keep  a  very  consistent  compatibility,  [] applications 
compatibility? 
 
Petro:   Yes, we will maintenance our operating system.  We have a lot of things 
to  do  of  course.   We know this, right.  We have to put out the dust a little 
bit, right, so we know this.  We will do this, and we will license this. 
 
Q5:  ...There are things--I'm sorry, one more question, 
 
Petro:  One more, er... 
 
Q5:   There is something that has always amazed me, is to know why do we have so 
much..  Why are we so arrayed on the PowerPC platform, because there are already 
quite a few... 
 
;petro laughs; 
 
Q5:   ...No,  no no, let me...  There are already quite a few 68000 emulator box 
running, the ones from Apple, from other competitors, and it is not so difficult 
to  cross-compile,  as  we  have  seen in the PowerPC MacIntosh during the first 
years. 
 
Petro:  joking, Yeah, but please don't forget--two bankruptcies! 
 
Q5:  Yeah, I know, I know, I know. 
 
Petro:   plaintive  I'm  getting  crazy!   They said I'm already [doing up?] the 
third one! 
 
Q5:  laughs I just cross my fingers you never go to the third one! 
 
[...] 
 
Jim:   He  sent  me  an  Amiga...  I got a guy in my office who's from Corporate 
Design.  He stole my Amiga. 
 
laughter, interjection (Petro?):  I'll send you another one; 
 
So, I guess it's No. 
 
Q5:   How do you know that this platform is so fantastic if you never had one of 
them? 
 
Jim:   I'll  tell you what happened.  It was kind of interesting.  I went out to 
Wired  Magazine to see Lou [Zeno?], who is both an important publisher in our... 
Well  he's  a  friend of mine.  And in the last year, Wired had become a Gateway 
shop.  And Zeno took me to the back room where they're doing the development for 
HotWired,  and  it  was  all Amiga.  And he said he wanted me to know that since 
he'd  heard  a  rumour  we  were  in the process of acquiring Amiga, that we had 
bought  the finest multimedia platform for the development of the Web long-term, 
and  that his black box, er, I've forgotten the word for it, but his people were 
great Amiga lovers, and I asked the people and they said so, and then I wandered 
around  the  [Southland?]  market  Web  site  manufacturing  area  with a lot of 
consultancies in the US and Amiga is one of the dominant companies. 
 
Then  I  talked to a friend of mine, his name's Chase Carey, who is on the board 
with  Fox  TV  and  I  found  out  that Amiga is widely used now in the American 
television  industry  in  deference  to  [Cairon?]  and other kinds of on-screen 
graphic application packages, and then I found out that 50% of the cartooning in 
America is done on Amiga platforms.  And then we cut a deal with George Lucas to 
put  Destinations in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Museum in 
Washington,  for Lucas' Star Wars exhibit and in doing so, I found out that they 
are important to their 3D special effects people. 
 
So  I took the word of people whose judgment I trust.  I would never take my own 
word  about  what's  good  technology  because  I  am  a  marketer.   I'm  not a 
technologist--I couldn't spell Computer if you [spotted me the Comp?].  But I am 
compelled to believe that this is a great platform. 
 
 
Q6:   Some  questions  first for Petro:  Are we likely to see any updates on the 
present Workbench or do we wait for 4 to come along? 
 
Petro:  We are working on this.  I will not make any promises because this would 
be  out  of  style.  If we say something, we will stick to this.  I hope that we 
can launch an OS upgrade in November.
