@{"b"}Fusion 2 Announced@{"ub"}  

Fusion now looks set to take over from Shapeshifter as the best Mac emulator for the Amiga. Version 2 promises support for MacOS 8, supporting all SCSI controllers, better MMU support and of course, bug fixes.  

A PowerPC version is still set to be released soon. Just imagine - buy a PowerUP card, and get a free PowerMac...
