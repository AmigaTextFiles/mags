@{"b"}Darreck Lisle at the Amiga Users of the Heartland Meeting@{"ub"} 

 
Darreck Lisle, Amiga Inc.'s utility infielder (event coordinator, PR man, 
and pretty much anything else necessary until a full staff gets hired), 
spoke last week at an Amiga user group meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.  Set on 
the grill, this is the summation of the Q&A session that ensued. 
 
Q:  Should we buy AmigaOS 3.1? 
A:  Yes--you will need the ROMs for the updated AmigaOS anyway. 
 
Q:  Is graphics card compatibility going to be built into the next OS release? 
A: Yes--some type of RTG standard should be included as well as an AHI-type 
of standard. 
 
Q:  How long should we expect to wait before we see new systems? 
A:  Probably around a year. 
 
Q:  Are there any other enhancements to the Amiga you foresee? 
A:  Possibly support for the Universal Serial Bus (USB). 
 
Q:  What is Amiga, Inc.'s position on UAE, the Amiga emulator available 
    for Microsoft and UNIX?   
A:  The current practice of pirating Amiga ROMs will be cracked down 
    on shortly. 
 
Q:  What does Amiga, Inc. think about Java? 
A:  We would like to see Java in the next OS, but there is still a lot to be 
    done in this area. 
 
Q:  Are we going to see any of the current operating system hacks, such as 
    MUI, built into a future AmigaOS? 
A:  Possibly--however, MUI is too large and bulky to consider making it an 
    integral part of the OS.  A TCP stack is a definite possibility. 
 
Q:  Will the prices of existing systems be dropped, like say $1000 off the 
    existing A4000T prices? 
A:  Yes--Amiga motherboards are quite simple in design so cost should 
    reduce, especially after improvements are made to the current design, 
    such as optimization of the existing custom chip set. 
 
Q:  Will Amiga, Inc. be coordinating with third parties? 
A:  Yes--that is one of the main goals of Amiga, Inc.
