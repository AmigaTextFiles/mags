@{"b"}Formats to Send In As@{"ub"}  

@{"b"}Text Articles@{"ub"}  

You should send the text in as plain ASCII. Please note, you DON'T have to terminate each line with a linefeed (ASCII 10) as in pure ASCII, as a web browser / amigaguide will automatically format the text, wrapping the word around. If you do send it as pure ASCII, then make sure the line length doesn't exceed 76 characters.  

Please don't stick any wierd codes from your word pro, just tell us what you want done. If you know any HTML, feel free to stick some codes in (although I will do so if you don't).  

We will alter articles if necessary so that all articles have a similar presentation style.  

@{"b"}Pictures@{"ub"}  

If you are sending into the Graphics section, the preferably IFF, GIF, PNG, JPEG, either AGA or non-AGA. We can read almost any file format if necessary, although we may change the file format to suit our needs (probably into PNG).  

If they are pictures as part of an article, then there are some things you should note if you want them to appear in amongst the text. 
    	
    Preferably make them share the palette, 
    	
    Don't use JPEG format, as it'll take ages to load  

Don't worry, that only applies to piccys appearing in with the  text. You could have it so that pictures are loaded with a separate link (just tell us what you want), in which case there are no restricions (though don't expect us to include 500k of screenshots with your game review!)  

@{"b"}Music@{"ub"}  

Please use standard tracker or any of the MED formats (up to and including SoundStudio). If you want to send in with another format, then send a compatible player too please. Again, we reserve the right to alter the format for consistancy (although we won't if the quality of the music is affected!)
