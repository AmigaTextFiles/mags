@{"b"}Phase 5 and Haage&Partner Clash!@{"ub"}  

What follows is Haage&Partner's WarpUP/WarpOS announcement, and Phase 5's  response to it:  
WarpUP: A high-speed kernal for PowerUP 
 
Finally the Amiga has its PowerPC.  Everyone of us owes Phase 5 a lot of 
gratitude for that.  Because it was them who steered the CPU-discussion 
into the right direction.  Through their PowerUP&uml;-boards they ensure 
that the Amiga will regain its rightful position at the top of technology. 
 
The PowerPC-technology offers a maximum of technological security for the 
future.  Under the banner of their motto "NO RISC NO FUN", Motorola have 
already taken the first step that Intel processors have yet to make.   Due 
to this decision, CPUs with a clock speed of up to 350 MHz are now 
available.  And a limit to this is not in sight. 
 
Hardware-development is only one side of the coin in this respect.  Without 
the appropriate software even the very best hardware is not really worth 
much.  Therefore the biggest burden is currently carried by software 
developers all over this world.  They are pondering the question whether 
porting their software to the PPC will pay off.  Switching to a new CPU 
involves porting and maintaining the software for two different kinds of 
CPU.  It is due to this fact that many software developers (despite 
promising announcements) still sit back and watch the market before 
starting the effort of doing a port. 
 
What makes the right decision easier is a software-interface to the 
hardware which guarantees that future hardware-developments can be utilised 
by the software without changing it (it does not matter whether this 
hardware will be a new PowerPC-board from a third-party manufacturer or a 
PowerPC-Amiga from Amiga International Inc.).  Exactly this functionality 
is offered by WarpOS which was developed on the Phase 5 dual-processor 
boards by our authors Sam Jordan, Michael Rock and Jochen Becher. 
 
WarpUP forms a so-called hardware-abstraction-layer (HAL) between the 
hardware and software-applications.  This HAL guarantees the proper 
function of these applications on different PowerPC-concepts.  To every 
software-developer this offers a risk-free start into a new era of 
software-development for the Amiga. 
 
WarpUP forms the interface between the 68K-, PowerPC-hardware, the 
68K-operating system software and the software-applications.  The premier 
issue is of course to optimally exploit the speed provided by the 
PowerPC-CPU while at the same time making applications as easy to port as 
possible.  For the first time on the Amiga, WarpUP allows using native 
PowerPC-applications as well as applications and shared libraries in mixed- 
and fat-binary form. 
 
The StormC C/C++ developer system offers the possibility to compile an 
AmigaOS-application as a native PowerPC application by simply setting a 
compiler option.  The necessary switching between the 68K-AmigaOS and the 
PowerPC- functions is handled by the WarpOS-kernel within WarpUP.  This is 
a valuable advantage for the software developer.  The reason for this is 
that even a direct port of the software achieves a sufficient performance 
increase.  Conceptual changes to the software only become necessary if even 
the last bit is too be squeezed out of the system. 
 
WarpUP offers the following advantages: 
Highspeed communication-interface between the 68K- and PowerPC-CPU. 
 
Entirely native multitasking, native memory management, semaphores, 
list-/tag-management, signalling, message handling.  
 
Facultative memory protection: tasks are given the option of allocating 
protected memory areas.  
 
Virtual signals, i.e.  signals are CPU-shared and are always redirected to 
the correct CPU.  
 
Inter-CPU message-system: messages can be passed between the CPUs 
 
Optimal use of the PPC-MMU and the PPC-Cache 
 
MMU/Exception-handling support for applications 
 
PowerSave-function that shuts down the PPC if no applications use it 
 
PowerPC-Enforcer (protects the first page)  
 
Detailed crash-requester that optimally aids the developer in finding 
errors 
 
Integrated debugging system to make bug-tracking easier.  
 
Special support for highly optimized software such as games and demos.  
 
Support for Amiga-compliant applications.  
 
PowerPC native, mixed- and fat-binary applications and shared-libraries. 
 
Also usable for alternative developer systems such as Modula- or 
E-compilers with PowerPC-support because objects are not mandatorily 
created in ELF; instead the tried and tested Amiga-compliant hunk-format 
can be used as well.  
 
Easy installation  
 
Hardware-independent  
 
Optimal future prospects 
 
We save the best for last, of course: WarpUP 
can be obtained free of charge from Haage & Partner!  You only have to pay 
your phone costs. 
 
This is our contribution towards a brighter Amiga-future.

Statement from Wolf Dietrich, Phase5: 
 
This is a short preliminary statement, which will be extended during the 
next week and can then be found on our web site http://www.phase5.de. 
 
phase 5 digital products is shipping the PowerUp boards as a complete 
solution, consisting of the powerful dual-processor hardware and the 
comprehensive PPC library and other stuff.  The PPC library is a complete 
PPC native multitasking and multiprocessing kernel.  It features everything 
that is necessary for all kind of software developments, even for adoption 
of different or future OS versions.  The information about disadvantages 
and slow communication between the two CPUs is nonsense, as our system 
software provides a comprehensive message and signalling system, which even 
provides protectable memory areas for each task, making PowerUp-compliant 
software ready for future memory-protected OS updates or versions. 
 
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE FUNCTIONALITY WHICH HAAGE&PARTNER OUTLINES AND 
PROMOTES IS NOTHING SPECIAL, BUT A STANDARD FUNCTIONALITY PROVIDED BY THE 
PHASE 5 POWERUP SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  We simply did not make so much noise 
about it.  It is also nonsense that the WarpUp software by Haage&Partner is 
faster then the PowerUp system software from phase 5 digital products; this 
may only be true when StormC is used for the compilation a PowerUp 
application. 
 
The WarpUp from Haage&Partner is a solution which is not compatible to the 
phase 5 solution.  As it does not use the HAL that is provided by phase 5 
digital products, but hacks the hardware by using an incomplete knowledge 
of the hardware functionality - which has been aquired by reengineering the 
phase 5 digital products software - it is most likely that it will not work 
with future revision changes or different product releases of the PowerUp 
series. 
 
Furthermore, phase 5 digital products will not tolerate that an 
incompatible software takes over the control of the PowerUp hardware and 
prevents the user from running software that has been developed for the 
PowerUp boards by phase 5 digital products as well as many other vendors.  
All software which is supplied by phase 5, and in which we have invested 
lots of work and financial efforts to make the PowerUp a useful product, 
would be disabled once the Haage&Partner software is installed in the 
system.  That includes for example the fast CyberGL native library as well 
as the MPEG video and audio decoding integrated into CGX V3.  Consequently, 
third party products using such advanced functionality would not run. 
USAGE OF THE THE HAAGE&PARTNER SOLUTION WOULD RESULT IN A COMPLETE 
INCOMPATIBILITY MESS.  In the interest of our customers, who buy our 
products with high expectations, and all our developers who expect a 
completely compatible product line, we will take care that the phase 5 
system software can not be disabled. 
 
Haage&Partner has - from the beginning - rejected to use the ELF format 
which phase 5 has introduced on the PowerUp boards.  The reason to choose 
this widely accepted format was to open the Amiga/PowerUp development to 
industry software standards.  As an example, the ELF format allows 
professional development for PowerUp even on other platforms (such as 
Motorola PPC systems, IBM AIX systems, even on Sun or under WindowsNT), 
where high performance PPC Cross compilers are available, which integrate 
far superior experience and performance; phase 5 is currently testing such 
compilers which may offer the chance to accelerate software such as the 
CyberGL native library and the PPC MPEG library even further.  Additonally, 
soon an update for SAS/C on the Amiga can be expected, which supports 
PowerUp and the ELF format. 
 
Haage&Partner, instead, wants to establish their own "extended 
Hunk-format", which may is derived from the Amiga Hunk format, but still a 
new and proprietary solution.  It is a concept that forces developers to 
use the only solution supporting this format - the Storm C compiler by 
Haage&Partner.  Haage&Partner declares it's product being open and 
Amiga-compliant - in fact, it is only open to the Haage&Partner standard 
and compliant to their own software solutions. 
 
At this point, it is important to mention that the software concepts of 
phase 5 digital products have all the time been focused on developments 
that open doors and smooth upgrade paths to future and completely revised 
OS versions, which incorporate functionalities such as memory protection 
and multi-processing (which is not supported by the Haage&Partner concept, 
BTW).  This has e.g.  also been proposed to Amiga International/Gateway2000 
in May this year, together with our offer for extensive technological 
cooperation.  To reach such a goal, we feel it is mandatory to set today 
guidelines for programming that make current Amiga/PowerUp developments 
more independent from the current OS revision by clear structured and 
object-oriented programming, instead of using the StormC concept of simply 
recompiling older sources (this issue will be adressed in detail later).  
 
As the solution from Haage&Partner is not compatible and can - because of 
it's proprietary software concept - not fullfill demands of professional 
developers, it is very unlikely that developers will choose it.  phase 5 
digital products highly recommends not to use this incompatible system, as 
well as the Storm C compiler which - because of the concept - is wasting 
most of the performance that the PowerUp boards can deliver (this issue 
will also be adressed in detail later). 
 
phase 5 digital products has supported Haage&partner with free developer 
systems, as well as all necessary information to develop compatible 
software and tools, thus enabling Haage&Partner to become a leading 
software vendor.  We also held many meetings explaining our strategy and 
goals to make the PowerUp a useful platform not only for a new generation 
of high-performance applications, but also for the development towards a 
new OS or OS version that fullfills the demands of the next century.  To 
our surprise and disappointment Haage&Partner has mainly used their status 
to create a replacement for the PowerUp system software which is intended 
to set a standard controlled by Haage&Partner, and they even attempt to 
trash the complete and comprehensive software development in which we have 
spend many efforts.  At the same time, they have yet not been able to 
present a stable running PowerPC application which the Amiga/PowerUp user 
would have an advantage from.  We highly disregard this contraproductive 
and confrontational behaviour, and will completely drop any support for 
Haage&Partner as a PowerUp developer as well as for any of their products.
