@{"b"}Patch Roundup@{"ub"}  

This is where I review those little but very useful programs. Please feel free to contribute!  

@{"b"}SetPatch 97@{"ub"} (Gareth Murfin) As you might expect, this is a rplacement for the SetPatch command. As it ever annoyed you the way it says '1985-1992' on your Amiga? Or the Commodore-Amiga  Inc messages? Attempts to convice people that the Amiga is not dead are rather in vain when they see these messages... but worry  no more!  

SetPatch 97 simply changes the initial title bar message to say something like '(c) 1985-1997 Gateway 2000...', and when you select 'About', it again has the date upto 1997, with Gateway 2000. My only complaint is that it says 'AmigaOS v3.1' whatever version you are actually using, but never mind, it might fool people into thinking I have OS3.1 when I actually have 3.0!  

Other than that, this SetPatch is the same as the latest 'official' version previously released. A simple but very nice little patch - I just hope 'Gateway 2000 doesn't suddenly become out of date...

 @{"b"}MagicTV 1.3@{"ub"} (Neil Crawforth) Requires AGA. This is one of those programs that seems to good to be true... how about a software flicker fixer?  

This is what it says, and those without monitors can run 640x512 without interlace, those with monitors can run 800x600 without interlace!  

It's not perfect however, after all, getting rid of the flicker without extra hardware is going to be difficult. The colours have to be altered subtely, which makes the screen look duller - this is something which cannot be avoided. Also, the program only works with up to 16 colours, but hopefully future versions will see up to 256 colours. Even as it is, it is useful for things like Workbench, Octamed, word processors, etc.  

Apparantly, there are some problems with '060 processor (which  sadly isn't relevant to me). Even so, I still found it a bit buggy; I've had quite a few mysterious crashes, especially when opening new screens, or changing screen modes. Hopefully these will be fixed soon.  

This is certainly worth checking out; with 256 colour support,  and bug fixes, it will be an unbelievable piece of software...
