	@{"b"}Name@{"ub"}	Klondike v5.1 (Mac version) 
	Description	Solitaire Game 
	Author	Michael Casteel and Dave Elward 
	Price	Shareware (Donation type) 
	System Requirements	A 'Mac compatible' computer...   

A Mac game reviewed in an Amiga diskmag? Whatever next... Well naturally, I'm running this via Shapeshifter, and when you've set  up SS, getting some programs for it is another matter. So I'd thought I'd recommend this to anyone as an addictive game which is easy to get running (a single file which fits in a 720k PC disk).  

The game itself? Just like any other Klondike, there aren't any special features, and the card sets are just normal ones (which is fair enough, I never saw the point of loads of silly pictures in the way...) And very addictive it is too, in fact, almost all the time I'm using SS, it's to play this game. Who said I wanted a Mac to run Photoshop or Netscape?  

I'm using the FastECS video driver to view in 16 colours at a very reasonable speed, more than fast enough for this sort of game, anyway.  

Anyway, Klondike is great, perfect for once you have got SS up  and running.
