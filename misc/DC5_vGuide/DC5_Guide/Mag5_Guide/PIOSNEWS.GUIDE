PIOS are soon to release their 'next generation Amiga'. Whether you consider it an Amiga is up to you, but it will be a decent machine equipped with PPC and gfx card - and what might as  well be AmigaOS 4. The real question is whether there will be anything in the way of emulation to run 680x0 Amiga binaries (UAE  doesn't count!) If there isn't, then it will certainly put many potential purchasers off. On the other hand, when/if an Amiga 680x0 emulation is produced for AmigaOS on PPC cards / PowerAmigas / A\BOX, etc, a port for pOS will surely be a consideration.  

The PIOS one machine will be available in two forms - one running pOS, but also one running MacOS (both also have BeOS and Linux). Essentially the same machine with a different OS.  

It seems strange that PIOS originally announced the machine as  a Mac/Amiga dual OS computer, but now they are saying it will be a machine with one or the other, but not both.  

So what of the Mac side? After the problems PIOS have had with  licencing the Amiga, and having to go for pOS, @{" " link "DC5_Guide1:Mag5_Guide/APPLENEWS.GUIDE/MAIN"} Apple are now not so keen on licenses, so it seems.  

Having a Mac clone as well as an Amiga clone will certainly aid the machine's success against the PC - I just hope that the Mac side of it doesn't steal all the attention.  
	----------------------------------------
 What of ProDAD's pOS itself? The prerelease is at number 2 in the  CD charts, so their must be plenty of curious Amiga users willing to at least consider it as the next AmigaOS.
