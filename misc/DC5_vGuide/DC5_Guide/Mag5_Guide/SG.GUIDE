Helooooo  (soory but my OOO bulloon keeps slicking and my  l  bullooon
dooes  nool woooork al all.  Crooss the l's soo lhal lhey looook  like

Do  you  have felt tip marks on your screen now? Sorry about taht  (Oh
no, my speelchicker is noo up the duiff), and back to normality now.


                Happy Xmas all you great Doubleclick! readers


Welcome to my Public Domain List.  Please click on a section below  to
find  out  more.  To finish reading an article,  please click  on  the
contents box at the top left of the screen,  or any of the browse keys
if you are just browsing!

I have included with the disk a @{b}@{i}FREE GAME!@{ui}@{ub}

It is Poing 4,  which must be one of the best Breakout,  or Bat & Ball
games this side of the Northern Hemisphere!  I play it to death, and I
am writing to the programmer of the game concerning registration,  and
if he can supply me with a way or merging highscore tables.  Don't try
and change them, as the tables are in binary and are protected anyway.
Highscores  are saved as soon as they are entered,  although  I  doubt
you will need to worry about that for a while,  on most levels anyway!
If  you do get a highscore,  send me a copy of the table,  and I  will
make  a  file in this guide of all the highscores I receive.  Pressing
escape to finish the game will return you to this guide.  You will  of
course  have to stop the music playing in the background first.   This
can  be  done by pressing both mouse buttons.  The actual  game  files
have been powepacked by me so that they would fit on the disk,  as  it
is now 100% full,  so I have had to cut some corners. This will result
in  a  slight delay in loading,  although once loaded there is no more
files that need to be accessed, so there will be no more delays.

I  need  to pay for all my postage somehow,  so send me the disk  back
with a first class stamp to cover the cost of the postage etc,  and  a
covering letter,  and I will send you my most recent version  of  this
disk.  Please feel free to copy this disk and pass it onto any of your
friends to look at.  I want to try and get this disk spread  about  as
much  as  possible to largen my database of penpals.  If you want  to,
write  to me and tell me your name and address and I will add  you  to
the list.  If you write to me, I will include a file on this disk that
has all of my penpals names and addresses on it,  so you can write  to
them  also.  This disk has just undergone a major rewrite to  make  it
easier to navigate,  and to read. The last version had a few problems,
which have since been ironed out.

I  am sorry,  but as this guide has been included in Doubleclick!,  we
have been unable to supply it with the free game as promised,  due  to
space  restrictions on the disk.  There is a simple remedy.  Write  to
me,  and swap some disks,  and tell me that you want the game Poing 4,
from the Cat Disk.  I will then supply you an Lha file of the game, as
well as the latest version of this guide.

Hello there and welcome to the Xmas Issue of the disk.

Click on your name below, if you are listed, or if you are nosey, then
just click any name.

Hellos this month go to:

@{"Mark Harman" link mesmarkh}

@{"Alan Hennebery" link mesalanh}

@{"Andrew Whiteley" link mesandyw}

@{"Morgoth - Genocide" link mesmorgoth}

Before I start - Merry Xmas once and for all.  There - that's  it  out
of the way!

I am in the process of making up new Utils,  Games,  Art,  and Magdisk
Archives,  to try and save some disks.  So far I have saved  about  25
disks,   so  that can't be bad!  You will notice that the Compilations
section is a bit different,  as it now only lists names.  This  is  to
save  space on the guide,  as there is no point in typing in the  same
description twice,  is there? This also means that there will be a lot
of  new  entries into the guide,  as I am now getting stuff  from  the
Aminet regularly. Stick with me, as all will be fixed soon.

Check  out the New PD section this month.  I have not bought an  order
for  a  while  now,   but  this should soon change.   Loads  of  great
animations  this  month  including a  Calvin  &  Hobbes  comic  strip,
Revenge Of The Blob,  and 3 animations from Eric Schwartz.  Also  find
the latest version of Doubleclick, Issue 4, as well as a new disk from
those  metal madmen,  Genocide,  who even mention me in their list  of
people to thank.On sorting out my disks,  I have eventually got around
to  listing stuff I have on archives for ages.  Now there is about  50
new titles so far this month (count 'em).

Also a few new adverts in the Adverts section (funnily enough!  What a
strange place to put them!).

I am in the process of making up an order for more PD software.  Watch
this space!

The regular penpals that I write to (Ragnar,  Mark, and Alan) will all
be happy to know that the hard drive saga may be coming to an end.   I
have MCP installed on my computer (Brilliant program!), and one of the
tooltypes stopped any of the root of the disk being written, which was
designed to stop viruses spreading.  This of course,  would not let me
reformat my drive.  Now I have 4 partitions,  the way I wanted them in
the  first  place.  Still have a few bad blocks to remap though,   but
have  shoved them in a drawer all by themselves.  Hopefully everything
should be OK.

Also,   another plea to readers,  I have just got hold  of  an  A500+,
which  is  running OK through my video,  but I can only use  the  Mono
socket, as I did not get an RF Modulator with it. Can anybody help?

New  this month is a change in the way Amicom run things.  A  lot  has
happened  to  Kevin,  who runs it.  He has since moved house  and  got
married.  Please note his new address in the advert. I will be sending
him an order very soon,  but he is compiling another catalogue disk at
the  moment,  so I shall wait until that is completed.  Also,  he does
have a honeymoon to go on, so he will be a bit busy.

Hear from you soon,


Stephen Graham

PS  Guess who is celebrating a Birthday on the 14th January 1998.  Yes
folks - it's me,  so dig deep and try to make it as good for me  as  I
would  do for you.  Think of the hard work we put into each and  every
issue of Doubleclick!  we produce,  and then think how much easier  it
would be if I had a CD Rom for the artwork I do,  a ZIP drive to  back
it  all  up,  and a Modem,  so that I could E-Mail it faster  to  Mark
which would mean we could get more issues released faster.  I have to
use somebody else's E-Mail server, which does take time.  Obviously it
goes without saying that more RAM and maybe a better accelerator
(PowerPC maybe) would be on the cards.

I will of course send you back a card stating that I got my gift. 
Send them to the usual address:

                                Stephen Graham
                   (Help-a-poor-man's-birthday-go-well-fund)

Only kidding, although a card would be nice!

Hi  there,  long time no speak to.  I was going to write to you  soon,
anyway.  I hope that you do not mind me using one of your mods for  my
disk,  but it really is good,  so I must do it.  I will of course,  as
you can see, give you full advertising.

Thanks for giving me a mention in your new disk, Crossing Over, which
I will be happy to add to my collection.

As to supplying you with some samples,  I shall see what I can dig up.
I have about 30 disks of stuff,  so I should be able to find something
that you like.

Write back and tell me if you have access to the Internet & E-Mail, as
I now have access myself,  and it would save me a lot in postage,  and
time,  if I could uploaded the data to you.  All in all, I should have
a few disks worth.

Hope that you like Doubleclick!  4.  Please read the letter with  this
disk as to some ideas I have.

write  to  you  in  the next week.  Thanks for the anims.   They  were
brilliant.  I have sent you another letter,  but I am sorry about  the
wait,  as I had some stuff to write for Doubleclick!  which I  had  to
send  back as soon as possible.  Sorry again,  and hope that you  like
the disks.

Loved the Mod.Fountain Of Sighs, by the way.

Also  glad  you got the E-Mail.  I will change the Website listing  by

Will write to you soon! Sorry about the Web Page!!!!

Thanks  for  the E-mails.  They have kept me from going  very  mad  at

write an E-mail to you soon, if Alan does not mind sending it.

Please  contact me as I have a few ideas I want to thrash  about  with
you  about  Vison,   basically what we talked about  before  re.   Web
Browsers.

Well,  we did it. DC5 is released before Xmas. Not bad considering the
hassles we have had (well you mostly,  as you are the one at  Uni  and
not me - I only work for a living! Ha Ha, only kidding!).

(Sorry, all you nosey people who are not Mark. I cannot release the E-
Mail address just yet,  because it is not mine personally,  and I will
need  to  ask  the user himself if it is OK to receive  E-Mail's  from

Andrew  Whiteley,  the programmer of Remdate - Got  your  letter  last
week.  Hope the exams go OK,  and glad you liked the disks. Will write
to  you later on to see how you got on.  Can't wait for 2.3!  After  I
reinstalled the hard drive,  I could not reinstall Remdate,  as I  had
the  wrong  keyfile  (as  before).    Don't  worry,   as  I  found  it
(eventually!).  Everything back to normal!

You  are a fast reader.  I only E-Mailed you and got a reply in  about
15 minutes,  so I have been informed,  as I don't actually send the E-
Mails personally.  Glad to see you will write soon, and I look

@{b}About Stephen Graham@{ub}
----- ------- ------

Hello.  My name is Stephen Graham. My birthdate is 14 January 1976 and
I  am  currently  21 years old and I want to get started  in  swapping
disks etc through the mail with other Amiga fanatics, like yourselves.

Here is a list of my computer Setup:
@{b}
A1200 with internal 2½" 260 MB Hard Drive 
Appollo 1220 4 MB Memory Board with 68882 Maths Co-Processor plus Clock
2 External Floppy Disk Drives  
CitizenABC 24 Pin Dot Matrix Colour Printer 
Panasonic KX-P1180 9 Pin Dot Matrix Black & White Printer 
Goliath Upgrated Power Supply 
Wizard Developments Black 3 Button Mouse 
RoboShift Joystick / Mouse Splitter
Camlink Stereo Sound Mixer 
Konix Sppedking Joystick (Which  I have  had  for 5 years!)  
Konix Navigator Joystick 
A600 with 1 MB Trapdoor Memory Upgrade plus Battery Backed Clock
A500+ (But I have no RF Modulator)
Cambridge Z88 Laptop (Soon to have a Connection to the Amiga A1200)
@{ub}

I  have  been  collecting Public Domain for  a  few  years  now,   and
although  my collection is not very large,  (350 ish disks),   I  have
quite a lot of other disks from mags etc,  and friends. I also run the
latest  version  of Virus Checker and Virus Z 2 on startup  to  combat
virus infection.

I  have  been interested in computing from a very early age.  My  very
first  computer was a ZX81 (remember them!)  with a full 16K  upgrade!
Wow!  I had two of them before I upgraded to a ZX Spectrum (the  first
one  with the dead man finger keys!).  From there I bought  a  48K  ZX
Spectrum (The black one with the fold down feet),  and from that a  ZX
Spectrum +2,  which at the time was the cutting edge of technology.  A
whole 128 KB of power.  I also had a Radio Shack TRS-80,  which I only
used for playing chess and Card Games - it was that primitive.  I then
decided it was time for a change,  and bought an A600 with my brother.
Wow!   Programs  that loaded in less than three days,   and  they  had
decent sound and graphics.  I was converted.  I had a shot of friend's
Atari ST, but it was not the same - The Amiga was the one for me!

Soom  after  this  my brother and I,  who owned  half  of  the  Amiga,
decided  to  upgrade  up  to an A1200.  We did  and  since  them  have
expanded  the  system.  We bought the printer first  because  we  were
currently  using  an Epson 9 pin Black & White  and  the  quality  was
quite literally,  crap! We have since bought the Hard Drive (Notice to
all  non-Hard  Drive owners:- GET ONE NOW.  YOU WILL NOT  BELIEVE  THE
DIFFERENCE!),  and we are currently saving up for a CD-ROM,   a  Sound
Sampler and an Colour Inkjet Printer.

I also own a Cambridge Z88 Laptop computer, which is handy to type out
your letters when you are out and about,  or away from home. I am just
about  to  buy  a  cable that connects the Z88 to  your  Amiga.   It`s
something I`ve wanted for a long time.  Eventually, I got it. All good
things  come to those who wait.  I also have a Phillips CDi  with  the
Digital  Video  Cartridge,  lots of films and  games  etc.   It  is  a
brilliant machine to play with.  Does anybody else have one, and would
like to swap tips etc about games, and maybe even some discs?

I  am  now also a Co-Editor for Doubleclick!,  the Amiga disk magazine
produced  regularly  by Pentrisoft.  It is freely  available  from  PD
Libraries,   as  well  as Pentrisoft,  Amicom PD,   Mark  Harman  (The
Pentrisoft  President),  as well as myself.  A worthy read  which  has
loads of articles to suit just about any taste.

I  work  in the mornings delivering newspapers with my brother.  After
that  I work as a mechanic in my father`s garage,  fixing cars.   From
time to time I am a DJ,  who runs his own mobile disco (which was paid
for  out of the paper round - think of the price of CD`s and equipment
etc).

My  main  interests  are  Cars,  for obvious reasons,   Computing  and
Motorcycling  and I own an L Reg Kawasaki AR125 in Team  Green  Racing
colours.  My young brother has got an N Reg black Kawasaki  AR50  (yet
another  paper round extravagance - we use them in the  mornings).   I
want anything you like on the disks,  Demos, slideshows, games, utils,
you name it, I want it. All letters answered 1200%.

Thanks for watching, and send me your jiffys.

Please write to me at the following address:-

PO BOX 8353
Largs
North Ayrshire
Scotland
KA30 8HG
@{ub}
Or phone me:  (0468)  508871, but this number's my mobile phone. Do so
at your own risk.

Please feel free to send anything you like to me, letters, disks, Mars
Bars  (None  with Rat Poision although),  magazines etc.  All  letters
will be answered with a few disks maybe,  full of my latest PD etc.  I
am  looking to write to anyone,  over 16,  male or female,  who has  a
sense of humour.

Due  the  price of disks,  I will only send you one disk  if  you  are
writing to me for the first time,  but if you send me disks,   I  will
send  you  some back in return.  This is to stop people who  are  only
looking for free disks!  I am not a charity!  Please write to me about
anything  although  I  am   most   interested   in  Cars,   Computers,
Motorcycling,  Music, and Humour! I would appreciate if you could bung
in a few first class stamps,  as I need to pay for the packages I send
to  my PD Library,  currently averaging about 2.50 a package.  If  you
send  me  free stamps,  I can spend more on PD,  and you  can  have  a
greater selection.

Please  feel  free  to copy this disk and pass it  onto  any  of  your
friends to look at.  I want to try and get this disk spread  about  as
much as possible to enlargen my database of penpals.  If you want  to,
write  to me and tell me your name and address and I will add  you  to
the list.  If you write to me, I will include a file on this disk that
has all of my penpals names and addresses on it,  so you can write  to
them also.

Anyway, send me your jiffys!

Thanks for watching,

Write to you soon,

@node why "Why I Did This Guide"

@{b}Why I Did This Guide@{ub}
--- - --- ---- -----

I found that after writing off to a few PD Libraries, they all stocked
roughly the same thing. I thought that if I wrote to the magazines and
advertised my disk in the PenPals and small Ads section,  people would
write to me, having had the same dealings with PD Libraries. I want to
make  it clear that I am NOT a PD Library,  just someone who does  not
want  to  lose  the Amiga.  I am not charging money for  this,   I  am
treating this the same way as you would writing to a penpal.   If  you
had  a  penpal and he sent you a tape or CD etc,  you would not expect
to  pay  for it.  This is not to say that money received will  not  be
appreciated.  If you feel I should get money for what I am doing  then
don`t let me stop you.  I also did this guide for the challenge,   the
sheer  hell of it,  and really because nobody has even tried something
like this before!

This  version  is better in some ways than previous ones  as  all  the
text is in one Amigaguide document,  whereas in previous versions, the
textfiles were stored in a separate directory called Text.

This  had  some  advantages and disadvantages.  Editing  the  previous
version  was  harder,  as there was lots of different  text  files  to
change,  but now the whole file is loaded into Ram,  whereas the  text
viewer I was using only loaded in the file when needed.  You win some,
you lose some!

All  at  Amicom PD - Thanks for the last order.  You really are  hyper
fast.  I received the order before I sent it! You really must eat your
Weetabix  in the morning!  Anyway,  thanks must go to all  at  Amicom,
Kevin,  Ian,  Sharon, Leanne, andall the Amigas for taking the time to
look at my disk.  It has not been a waste of time after all.  You said
that if you had time,  that you would phone me. I keep missing you, so
you  gave me your home phone number,  which I will just write here  to
see  if it is Ok.  (01234)  567890.  I will not give it out as I  know
what  it is like having people phoning you up when you do not want  to
listen to them.  I will try and phone you sometime.  Bye!! Sorry about
the  size  of  the last order.  I really did get a bit  carried  away.
Anyway,   that  will be me for about 10 minutes,  before  I  send  you
another order. Write to you soon.

Alan,   my  brother  - As I am writing this,  he  is  in  my  bedroom,
watching a film on my video,  as I am using the computer, in his room,
and he cannot use his video as I am here.  Thanks for the time on  the
computer (we usually share the time).

All  the  people who work for the National Grid - Keeping me  supplied
with electricity.

All  the Octamed composers - For writing all the Modules that  I  have
in my collection. There are too many people to thank by name.

Commodore - For inventing the Amiga in the first place!

Mark  Harman  -  Mark is the author of Doubleclick,  A brilliant  disk
magazine  to  which I regularly contribute,  as I am a Co-Editor.   He
works  hard at it and deserves the credit for the work he has done  so
far.

Andrew  Whiteley  -  Not  only did he write  Remdate,   the  excellent
Organiser program, he also saved my Hard Drive from extinction a while
back. VERY helpful, and must be mentioned. Thanks a lot, Andy.

Many more people who I know & love, but have forgotten to mention!

alphabetical  order,  so any new titles will be  in  there  somewhere.
Sorry,   it  would have been easier to just list  new  titles  at  the
bottom,   but it would have been harder to search for any titles  that
you  think I may have.  I cannot say what these programs will run  on,
as  I  only own an A1200 and an A600,  so if the program is 1.3  only,
then  there is a chance that I will not have it,  or if I do,  I  will
say that you must use Kick 1.3 to run it.  It is wise to get a copy of
this disk as it will no doubt pay for itself in no time at all.

To browse through the list,  just click on the letter you require, and
it will be displayed. This feature was suggested by Paul Lathwell, the
author  of Address Print,  and Onform.  This is to aid the  reader  in
finding a specific program.

Due to the number of disks that I am storing,  some of the titles will
be on other disks,  along with other titles,  which happens mostly  in
the Utility section of my collection.  This works better for you, as I
will just copy the whole disk,  so that you get more programs than you
asked for.

Occasionally,  I will go through my collection and weed  out  all  the
useless titles,  which,  at the time of writing I am doing. This is so
that I can use the blank disks.  I may LHA the files to the Hard Drive
for  use later on,  but then again I may delete.  I will try  to  have
titles  that  you ask for but I cannot promise anything.  Also,   just
because  it is on the list does not mean that I have it.  You  may  be
reading an old version of the list.

To  make it a bit easier for myself,  I have separated all the  titles
into different headings and put them in their own disk boxes.  I  have
listed the headings below.  Click on them and you will be given a list
of  titles,  although explanations of the titles will be in  the  main
guide.  This is so that you can see what numbers of varying headings I
have.

Mindguard  -  Dont  ask  what this does.  I cannot  even  explain  it.

Octamed  Tutor - Mods by ABBA on this disk.  Worth  it  for  the  Mods

OJ  Simpson  (The  Trial)  - A very well put together  disk  about  OJ

Onform V1.1 - This is a very good AMOS written Invoice and Order Util,

Oracle  -  Nothing to do with the ITV teletext service  (is  it  still

PC Task V3.10 - Convert your Amiga into a PC. A very slow PC at that.

PC Tools - As it says. Converts into a PC Dos tool.

PD Games Compilation (Stephen Graham)  - At present there are 11 disks
that I have compiled that are stuffed to the limit with all of the  PD
Games that I had on my Hard Drive before I had to clear it out due  to
a  lack of space.  A full list of all of the contents of the disks can
be loaded from the Contents.

Pendle Europa Music Modules - Well presented disk of tunes.

Pengo - Get this! It cannot be explained. It is very very good.

Personal  Paint Icons - This is an Arexx script which  allows  you  to
edit icon files using Personal Paint V6.3 and above. Excellent!

Petrol Engine - First in a long line of excellent engine animations.

Pezzas Games - 3 Excellent Games. 2 card ones and something else.

Phantom - Brill Space Invaders Game.

Phone  Locator - This is a brilliant program.  Not only does  it  tell
you  the  area that the STD code covers,  but type in the  full  phone
number,  and it will also tell you the area of the STD code  that  the
number  comes from.  Useful if one STD code covers many  towns,   like
most of them!

Phone & Post Codes - Finds all UK STD code AND Town Post Codes!

Pick - Very good program. Reads a random line from an ASCII Text File.
Wow,  say you,  what good is that? Quite good, if you can then program
the computer to act on that line.  Let's say that the text file has  a
list  of  pictures.  Pick will select one of these pictures.   With  a
little  AmigaDOS knowledge,  you can then assign  that  picture  to  a
string  variable,  which you can then instruct a picture  viewer  like
PPShow,  to display.  If all this was put in the startup sequence, you
could have a random Startup Screen every time you booted up!

Pick  Out  - Meant to be a good card game but it does not load  on  my
computer easily!

Picture Menu - Yet another WB program launcher.

Picture Puzzle - Select a picture. Select a tune. Select the number of
boxes.  The picture is split up into boxes,  and it is jumbled up. You
swap  the  boxes about until you end up back where you started.   Good
Fun.

Piles  'O' Tiles - EXCELLENT match the pairs game.  It's level pegging
with  Dragon Tiles,  except it may nudge ahead as it has  more  levels
(Full version has 42 levels).

Please Release Me - Brilliant anim of country song. Very Funny!

Plot - Not unlike Polyfit.

Point  Of  Sale  -  Fantastic Demo,  but all the text  is  written  in
Francais.

Polyfit - Draws funny graphs with lines etc.

Pop Quiz - Hey, pop pickers, what do you know about music?

Poster Print - Wow! Speaks for itself.

Powercalc - Very powerful calculator (hence the name?).  Handy for all
you maths people out there.

Powerlogo  V1.3 - Amiga Version of the LOGO Language.  If you  studied
Computing at school,  like me,  then you would have been taught  LOGO,
which  is  the  language that controls all the funny turtles  and  pen
plotters you see on TV, on Blue Peter etc.

Print A Card - Make your own Birthday cards etc.

Printmaster - Do fancy things with your printer.

Pro Bingo - AMOS written Bingo Game, Quite good.

Rainboot - Startup util which plays anims, loads screens, whatever.  I
use it, and there are plenty of Rainboot configs available through the
Aminet (or from me.  If you ask nicely enough, I might be able to get
the latest ones off the 'Net).

Rainboot PCom - One of the Rainboot programs.

Real Drag - 

Real Time - Monitor what your Amiga is doing.

Red  Dwarf Demo (2 disks)  - Digitised version of short sketch  (White

disk.

Relokick 1.3 - Turn your A600 & A1200 into a A500!  A must  for  older
stuff!

Remdate v2.2 - BRILLIANT Diary.  I am just about to register for  this
program.  It is very,  very,  very good.  I suggest you use it with  a
battery backed clock,  as it saves a lot of time.  I used it before  I
got  mine  with  my memory board,  and it just is not as  good.   This
program is very slick,  and has loads,  and I mean loads, of features.
A  Must Get!  (Footnote - Do what I have just done,  and register  for
this most excellent program. It really is worth it in the long run!).

Remind 1.5 - Some of those yellow Post it notes for your WB screen.

Reorg  -  This is another one for the Must Have list.  When  you  save
files on a fresh disk,  everything is saved OK,  but lets say that you
delete  a  file from a disk,  and replace it with a bigger or  smaller
file.   The  files saved from now on will be fragmented all  over  the
disk,  which means the disk takes longer to load and use.  Reorg takes
all  the files,  and recopies them onto the disk,  in the right order,
without deleting any of them, and puts all the empty blocks at the end
of the disk. Brilliant or what?

Reqtools - Newish version of the Req files.

Revenge  Of  The  Blob (2 Disks)  - This is a very well  put  together
animation of the Calvin & Hobbes characters where the tapioca  pudding
fights back!

Reversi 2 - Othello with a different name.

Road To Hell - Pretty boring driving game.

Robs Rockers 2 - More NT and Octamed modules.

Rocketz - Gravity Force style game with rendered graphics.

Roobarb & Custard Remix - Yep! You guessed it! Another excellent mod.

Roswell - Everything you wanted to know about the little green men's
favourite holiday camp.  Also has a spooky music module.

Roulette - Lose your money now, and place your bets!

Rush Hour - Control all those traffic jams on your city,  by switching
the traffic lights at the junctions. Mad fun!

Santa  And  Rudolph - Brilliant Xmas game.  You are  either  Santa  or
Rudolph,   and  you have to shoot ducks with a gun,  while  collecting
presents, and floating on a balloon. Sounds crap but it isn't.

Savings  Certificate  Advert  Anim - Remember  the  advert  about  the
butterfly  and the frog? Well now you can watch it on your  Amiga.   I
found  it  was best to boot this disk,  and not load it via Workbench,
as it sometimes crashed.

Scorched  Tanks  - Very Very Very GOOD Tank Hunter  game.   Nuke  your

something to display the phone codes for a given town.

Sickness Simulator - Very daft samples of people throwing up! Sick!

Simpsons Icons - Loads of full colour icons of your favourite
Springfield family.

lots of littel files.

SmallCalc - Calculator which only adds small numbers.  No, it is quite
small on the screen.  No, wait a minute, it does not take up much
memory.  Yes, that's it!

Smart Trash - Do you want to chuck it out, or will you keep it at the
last minute?  This is the program for you.  Controls the WasteBasket.

Smovie - Video Titling Program.

Sonic Drum Kit- Brilliant util for making drum loops for use in
Octamed etc, or for just having a bash around.

Sonix Jukebox #3 - Tunes done on Sonix for your listening pleasure.  I
was  wondering why they picked the title for the disk that  they  did!
By  the way,  it is presented in a jukebox style fashion and it is the
third in the series of these disks! Wow. Amazing or what?

SoundBox - 

Sound Collection 20 - Smus songs to listen to.

Splitter - Split large files into not so large files.

Springtime - Brilliant.  I deleted this of my Hard Drive  my  mistake,
so  I  ordered  another copy from Amicom (Brilliant Pd Company  -  see
advert  in  main guide!).  Move around a 3D floor and put  the  spring
onto the X. Simple, you may think. NOT!!!

Star Trek Rave Demo - Only for Trekkies! Pretty sad really!

Star Trek Themes (2 Disks)  - A must for trekkies. Demo with the title
music  for  the  original  Star  Trek  and  the  title  for  The  Next
Generation. Brilliant Sound Quality.

Star  Wars Artwork - Brilliant Ray Traced Images from Starwars plus  a
few more, ie JCB, cars etc. Very good quality.

StartupKey - Enables the user to have a choice of Startup Sequences.

States  Of  Europe  V1.0  - Info about European countries.   Hyperbook
format. Very well done.

STD  -  Type  in Phone Code,  find out where it is.  Type  in  a  town
instead of the code, and you will get the code.

Stealthy 2 - Animation of your favourite plane!

Steam Engine - Even more anims!

Stereopticon - Make Magic Eye Pictures.

Sterling Engine - More great animations!

Stick It 2 - Leave Post It notes all over your WB screen.

Stock Controller Pro V1.2 - Stock control program which is ideal for a
small business.  Unfortunately,  I cannot get it to run properly.   It
looks  brilliant  as well,  and possibly does  not  run  on  an  A1200
without crashing.  It will load OK and then crash.  I will investigate
further.

Stonecracker - Make files much smaller.  Quite good, and better than
Powerpacker, but not Lha in my estimation, which must be worth a bit.

Suicide Machine - Absolutely BRILLIANT shoot `em up using the mouse!

Suicide Machine - Funny Op Wolf game. NOT for members of RSPCA etc.

Superballz - A brilliant Marble Madness style game,  where  you  guide
your ball to the exit,  clicking switches,  avoiding spikes etc, along
the way.  Written in Blitz Basic, and it is brilliant. Also comes with
full  source  code,   and IFF Graphic files,  which  you  can  change,
although, this really is not needed, as there is also a Level Editor.

Super Cars, Bikes & Planes - More excellent piccys of transport.

SuperDisk - Make disks up to 960K,  just like the ones that  AUI  used
to  use,  before they decided not to publish a magazine any more.  Oh,
how I shall miss them so!

Super Duper - Brilliant disk copier program.  Takes up no room at all.

Super Formatter - Format those disks in the blink of an eye.

SuperDuper31 - Disk copier.

Swapmode+ - Change your screens from PAL to NTSC.  Very handy  if  you
are running a high res interlace screen on a TV,  like me. There are a
few  problems  with  some programs crashing with it,   Personal  Paint
being one of them, but none the less, it is a great program.

Swazinfo - make nice requesters, with not the usual boring text.

Swimsuit Cardset - Lots of girls in swimsuits for Klondike 3 AGA.

IFF files.

Tetren  -  Written  by Andy Whiteley,  the man  who  brought  you  the
excellent  Remdate V2.2,  which I registered for,  and I suggest  that
you do the same.  Because I registered for the programme, he gave me a
complimentary copy of his excellent game,  Tetren,  which  is  a  most
excellent  Tetris clone.  This,  I think is the full  version  of  the
game.   I  have  written to him,  asking if there is a  demo  version,
because you horrible lot do not deserve a full game for something  you
have  not  paid  for,   do  you? Only  joking,   I  wrote  to  him  to
congratulate him on writting such a brilliant game!

Tetris Pro - Brillinat graphics in this Tetris clone.

The Secret Key - Primarily most useful for modem users,  this produces
a  unique keyfile for an ASCII text,  and encrypts it,  so that it can
be sent securely.

The Wave - Makes lovely rippled screens, and saves them as IFF.

The ZX File # 1 - A disk magazine for ZX Spectrum Users,  like me, and
people  who use a ZX Spectrum emulator on their Amiga,  also like  me.
Also  has the program MC Master on the disk,  which prints out  covers
for audio cassette boxes. Why it is on there, I do not know.

Below is a list of songs that I have stored on my Hard Drive.   It  is
not  all of them,  as some of them are not very good and do not  merit
the  disk space.  Here is the list of the modules,  but remember,   to
save  space,  I have Powerpacked the songs,  so if you are using  them
unpacked, they will take up a lot more space:

I  must take the time to thank Alan Hennebery,  a penpal I swap  disks

Octamed Modules,  that I can add to my collection.  I will now have to

These modules all load OK into Octamed 5.  Below are some files  which
are  only loadable in Soundtracker.  These are not all of my ST  Mods,
as  I  have disks full of them,  but I still have not had the time  to

These are songs that are not necessarily Octamed Modules. If they are,

actually  4 or 5 Octamed Modules strung together.  Even  if  they  are

@node mcomp "Music Compilation Disks"


@{b}Music Compilation Disks@{ub}
----- ----------- -----

For ease of use,  and to save space on my Hard Drive,  I have compiled
some disks that contain most of my Octamed Modules,  with only  a  few
exceptions.   Most of the files are converted to MED & OctaMED  files,
and use SFCD Compression,  as combining these two can cut the size  of
the  files  quite drastically.  Most of them are sorted into different
catagories,   as  they are on my Hard Drive,   although  most  of  the
catagories have to be split up into different disks,  as they  are  so
big.   Because of this,  I think that only Octamed 5  can  load  these
files.  I don't think they load into Soundtracker or Noiseplayer.   If
you  want a particular song in these formats,  tell me and I  will  do
it, but remember to supply the disk as usual.

There are at present 27 Disks in the series.  I will list the contents
of each disk below:

@{b}Musical Instuments & Samples Disks@{ub}
------- ---------- - ------- -----

I  also  have a 16 disk set,  which contains loads and loads  of  drum
beats,  instruments,  samples,  sampled speech etc.  Also included  is
some Speech samples from Games,  ie Worms,  Mean Arenas, Valhalla etc.
Also  included is 2 disks of Workbemch Backdrops as a bonus,   because
they were archived onto the same disks.  What lucky people you are. If
you are interested,  then send me the disks,  and I will copy them.  I
am not really wanting to copy only a few of the disks,  as it is a bit
of  a  pain,  and due to the sheer volume of files on them,  I am  not
going  to list them all here.  If you really want only some  of  them,
then I may be twisted in the right direction, if the bribe is great.

@node favourite "My Favorite Public Domain Disks"

@{b}My Favourite Disks In My Collection@{ub}
-- --------- ----- -- -- ----------

Here  is  a  selection  of  the disks in my collection  which  are  my
favourites. In it are demos, games, utilities, you name it!

Army  Miner  -  A brilliant MineSweeper clone.  You  have  a  grid  of
squares and you click on the grid, working out where the mines are.

Big Time Sensuality - AGA demo with a Bjork soundtrack.  The graphics,
as  is the sound,  are brilliant.  Please note that it is AGA only and
has 2 disks.

Card  Games  Deluxe - Do you not have enough memory  to  run  Klondike
(Like me!)? Do you want to be able to play Videopoker as well? Do  you
want to use the Klondike cards as cardbacks? YES!  Well,  get this.  I
advise  that  you install it to your Hard Drive,  as it speeds  things
up.  You can also play MED modules in the background.  Octamed  5  can
save modules in MED format, so any song will do. (3 disks).

Deluxe  Galaga  -  This  has got to be the best  Space  Invaders  game
around.   Written  by  Edgar Vidal (the  same  man  who  wrote  Deluxe
Pacman),  the graphics are excellent and the game is so addictive.   I
have played it to death,  but I still have not send away the shareware
fee (ooeerr!!). I have both the ECS and AGA versions of the game.

Deluxe  Pacman - Same Guy,  same great game.  Brilliant conversion  of
Pacman, with loads of levels, and ghosts, and power ups etc.

Dialling Codes - Stuck for an STD Code.  Do you know the town but  not
the code.  This will help you.  Type in any town (or code) in Britain,
and  this program will give you the answer.  Sorry Alan,  but I  don't
think that this program covers Eire.  Belfast is in it,  but Dublin is
not.

Doubleclick  Disk Magazines - As a contributor to these magazines,   I
feel that this is a bit biased,  but they really are brill.  Loads  of
stuff  in  them,   and they are on a par with the legendary  Grapevine
series. I will of course have the latest version of the magazine.

Fast  Intro Maker - Make jazzy intros and bootblock intros  with  this
great  program.  I have sent away for the full version to  Deutchland,
but I have not had a reply back yet.

GuiArc  -  Expand  and dearchive all those programs on  your  magazine
disks.  Brilliant program.  I have used it for ages. Worth it's weight
in gold, about 57p as a disk does not weigh all that much!

Grapevine Mags - These are BRILLIANT!!!!!!  I have every issue from 15
onwards and I have a few early ones as well.  Very funny and very well
put together. I wish they would come back.

Jesus  On E's - Excellent Rave Demo.  All the others try to copy  this
one!   Takes seconds to load,  but about 30 minutes to play.  The  bad
thing  is that it is not HD installable and you must have and external
drive  to  use it.  Get one if you don't have one as you do  not  know
what you are missing. (2 Disks).

Kefrens  Desert  Dream - Dazzling Demo from Kefrens.   Set  in  Cairo,
Egypt in 1993,  is has a story at the start and lots and lots of great
effects by the end.  2 disks to this one,  but you can put the  second
disk  in df0:  when asked,  but it spoils the demo if you have  to  be
asked.

Kick  1.3  -  A  MUST GET!!  You need to get this to be able  to  turn
WB2.04 and upwards machines into a WB1,3 machine. Excellent program.

Motorola  Invaders  - AGA Space Invaders with a Metallica  soundtrack!
Very good graphics and sound. (2 Disks).

Numtris - Tetris with numbers. I registered for this game, as it is so
good.  Unfortunately,  I would be breaking the law if I gave  you  the
full version,  so I won't!  You have blocks with numbers on them which
fall into the pit.  Add up the colums in the pit to the number printed
on  the  bottom,   without  going over that  number,   and  the  colum
disappears.  On the left of the screen is the tiles left counter. When
it reaches zero,  you have completed the level.  It starts at 200.  On
the demo version,  the game ends when the counter reaches 100,  but it
still is a hard game, especially on the later levels.

OJ Simpson (The Traial) - Lots of info about OJ. Text, pictures, sound
samples - you name it. Very well put together.

Please Release Me - My favourite animation at the moment.  For all you
country music lovers, the song sung by a ballon. Very funny.

Quick  LHA  - I use this program every day,  for packing and unpacking
LHA archives,  easily, and most importantly, quickly. Also handles LZX
etc.

Remdate - This is a serious bit of kit.  It is a Diary and Planner for
your Amiga.  I would recommend that you have a battery backed clock, a
hard  drive,  and maybe some extra memory.  A lot to ask,  but  it  is
worth it.  You can input Birthdays, Special Days, Holidays, use like a
simple  diary to say what you did.  It also has a things to  do  list,
can  print  calendars,  pick lottery your lottery numbers,  absolutely
anything!  This is why I had to register for this program.  It is well
worth  the  slightly more than usual registration fee of  ten  pounds,
but in my view, it is money well spent.

Serious  Backgammon - Another game I will be registering.  Time  Limit
version  (5 Minutes)  of the popular board game.  Graphics  etc.   are
brilliant.   Tetris  Pro  -  I am a Tetris  Pro  Pro!   This  game  is
excellent!!  As you finish the lines,  a picture is revealed. Show all
the picture and the level is complete.  Some of the pictures are worth
playing for!

The Flintstones - Over 18's Demo about your favourite stoneage family.
Wheel Of Fortune - Great conversion of the TV Game. Edit the Questions
file on your favourite text editor to include your own entries.

Wormtris - This is a totally excellent Tetris game,  of which  I  have
many,   but I like this one as one of the best.  Cross between  Tetris
and Worms, which doesn't bear thinking about. Very daft and great fun.
X  Files  Guide  -  Lots  and Lots of info about  my  favourite  SciFi
programme. Also includes colour slides of Scully & Mulder.

There  you  have it.  Drop me a line if you want some of these  disks,
and I will send them out - remember of course to send me the disks!

Also,  keep checking the PD file for new editions. I am sorry, but the
file  has  been sorted into alphabetical order.  Before,  new editions
were at the bottom of the file,  but I found it to hard to read, so it
is now sorted.

@node waiting "Public Domain Titles I Am Waiting On"

This  is  a  list of PD disks I am waiting on.  I have  not  given  an
explanation of each disk - just it`s title. I probably will have these
disks  by the time you read this,  though!  It is in no real order  as
this list is only temporary and will only last about 1 issue.  If this
page is blank,  then all my new PD will be in the list,  and I have no
outstanding orders that I am waiting on.

@node new "New Public Domain Titles In This Month"

This  is a list of new PD disks I have just got.  I have not given  an
explanation  of each disk - just it`s title.  An explanation  of  each
disk will be in the main PD list document.

I already have had most of these titles for a long time now,  but they
were  on  loads of archive disks that I have had,  and I had  not  got
around to putting them onto the guide.  I have now,  and I am not even
half  way  through it - What you see below will fill  about  6  disks,
only about another 30 to go!

@node amicomad "Advert For The Best PD Library In The Whole Wide World"

A quick note from me:

I  have  bought the majority of my Disks from these guys for ages  now
and they are brill.  I sent them a package on a Wednesday of about  30
disks,  and I got it back on the Saturday.  Not bad considering  there
was  a 24 hour postal strike on the Thursday/Friday.  They always have
a  new  stream  of  disks arriving and are very  friendly  and  always
willing to help (Do I get my money now?). Long Live Amicom.

Please note that Amicom PD have now moved.  Note their new address
below:

Send you another package very soon.

          -------------

          Hi and welcome to our Monthly updated CATALOGUE DISK packed
          with loads and loads of quality Amiga PD & Shareware titles
          for you and your Amiga to enjoy.

          If you don't see the Title that you want, give us a call on
          (01924-864798) we may be able to get it for you.

          Well hope you do find something of interest and remember we
          also add loads more new titles every week. So keep in touch.


          H I N T S  ' N '  T I P S  O N  P D
          -----------------------------------

          When you purchase any of our  Titles you may be a bit eager
          to check them out. Well that's fine most of the Titles will
          bootup when inserted in your disk drive, but many will need
          either your  WorkBench disk or a particular  program to use
          the Title you purchased. 

          So please take time and read any document's you come across
          and don't get angry if you find that it don't seem to work.
          You may just be  doing  something  wrong and by reading the
          documents and following the instructions you will so get to
          use the Title you just purchased.


          H O W  T O  O R D E R
          ---------------------
          
          PLEASE TAKE NOTE
          ----------------
          Minimum accepted Cheques and Postal Orders is £3.00. Sorry.
          Orders of any less please send in  Postage Stamp value ok.

          Write down the DISK NUMBERS, TITLES and the AMOUNT of Disks.
 
          At the side of the  TITLES you will see if the disk is more
          than 1 disk  e.g. (A,B) at the end of a TITLE means it is a
          2 disk set, (A,B,C) means 3 disk set and so on. Also at the
          very end of the  TITLE line you will notice in brackets e.g.
          (Wb1,2,3) this tells you which type of SYSTEM the TITLE may
          work on. 
          
          (WE CANNOT GUARANTEE IF TITLES WILL WORK ON YOUR SYSTEM)

          There are too many systems to check them all correctly.


          H O W  T O  P A Y
          -----------------

          Please do NOT send any cash as it MAY go MISSING.
          Payment is accepted by Cheque or Postal Orders ONLY.
          (Minimum accepted Cheque / Postal Order value £3.00)

@node gamescompilation "A list Of Games Compilation Disks I Have Made"

Below  is listed some of the Public Domain Games that I have put  onto
disks,  to remove them from my Hard Drive. All the disks do not have a
startup-sequence and do not boot,  so you will have to load  Workbench
first to use them.

@{b}Disk 1@{ub}
---- -

Hydrozone  -  Fly  down a tunnel avoiding the walls  with  your  ship,
shooting all the aliens at the end of the levels.

Infection - An othello style game,  where you have to occupy  most  of
the squares at the end of the game to win.

4 Wins - Connect 4 for your Workbench.  Written in German, but easy to
undersatnd what the programmer wants you to do.

Army  Miner - Minesweeper on the Apple Mac has finally been  converted
to the Amiga. Pretty good conversion too!

Insectoids 2 - Horizontal Space Invaders written in Blitz Basic 2. The
graphics are pretty good.


@{b}Disk 2@{ub}
---- -

Think  A  Mania  - Find the pairs in this very well put together  game
with  brilliant graphics and sound.  There is even a high score  table
too.

Toobz - Cannot remeber what this game is,  but it must be pretty  good
or I would not have bought it, or even put it on my Hard Drive.

Tetris Pro - This is one brilliant Tetris Game. Graphics and Sound are
unbelivable. Take it from a self confessed Tetris Addict.

Amigatration - Another find the pairs game.  Not nearly  in  the  same
league as Think A Mania, but good all the same.


@{b}Disk 3@{ub}
---- -

Deluxe Pacman AGA - Brilliant Pacman Clone from Edgar Vidal,  the  man
who also wrote the legendary Deluxe Galaga, which I also have.

Tank Attack - Two tanks,  some hills,  some wind, lots of missles, and
lots of fun.


@{b}Disk 4@{ub}
---- -

Mastermind  -  Try  to  guess the sequence of  the  computer`s  balls!
(OOEERR!)

Caffine Free - Another space invaders game, but not bad at that.

Super Obliteration - Pang style shoot em up game with swish graphics.

Mortal  Kumbquat  -  Mortal  Kombat ripoff  of  two  pieces  of  fruit
fighting!

@{b}Disk 5@{ub} 
---- -

Quingo - A pretty good Quiz game with loads and loads of questions  on
loads and loads of subjects.


@{b}Disk 6@{ub}
---- -

Pub  Darts - Brilliant graphics and sampled speech on this great Darts
game.

Monopoly - First of two versions of the popular board game I have.


@{b}Disk 7@{ub}
---- -

Monopoly - Second version of the popular board game.

Megatron - Snakes style game with good graphics.


@{b}Disk 8@{ub}
---- -

Pengo - This is a brilliant platform game, with cute graphics and even
cuter (is that a word?) gameplay.


@{b}Disk 9@{ub}
---- -

Ooze - Othello style game.  Not bad.


@{b}Disk 10@{ub}
---- --

Masterblaster - Blitz Bombers,  but not as good,  but still brilliant.
The graphics are A1,  as is everything else, but A1200 users will have
to disable CPU caches and use the Original Chip Set to play the game.


@{b}Disk 11@{ub}
---- --

Hexamines - Mine Sweeper but played on a hexagonal board.   This  game
needs  a screen that is at least 400 lines deep,  so you will have  to
convert  to a High Res to play it.  I still have not done  so,   so  I
cannot tell you how good the game is to play.

Dieser  Zug  - This game is brilliant!  I was so nice and  though  the
game  was so good,  I even included it on the very disk you are  using
at this very moment.  To play it now, return to the Contents page, and
click on the box at the bottom.  It is very addictive.  If you  get  a
score  on the highscore,  send me the disk back,  and I will merge  it
with the other scores from other people.  I will then return the  disk
with  the newest version of the guide on it.  Please enclose  2  first
class stamps to cover postage, though.

Speed!   Demo  - Demo of the running-through-a-maze-as-fast-as-you-can
game. With the Excellent Module "Stardust Memories".

@node utilscompilation "A list Of Utilities Compilation Disks I Have Made"

This  is a list of most of the Utilities that I have.  What I did  was
Lha  the  files,  and cram as many as I could onto disks.  This  meant
that  where  before  I  had two disk boxes of  utils,   by  using  Lha
compression,  I now only have one,  which means I have saved about  40
disks,  which I can use to get more PD.  These disks do not  have  any
startup sequence,  just Lha files. If you cannot decompress Lha files,
I  can supply the Lha command and how to use it easily (Lha x <name of
archive> RAM:), or I could give you some utilities to do it for you.

This is only a list of what is on the disks.  To see what they all do,
refer to the guide.

@node clipart "A collection of the Clipart I have"

Below  is  listed some of the clipart disks I have in  my  collection.
What I have done is bought loads of Clipart over the years,  saved  it
onto my Hard Drive, and sorted it into directories for ease of use.

There  is  dozens of disks listed and I will just give you the  number
of the disk and what is on them roughly, in Subject Headings.

Disk 01 - Aminals
Disk 02 - Animals 2 
Disk 03 - Animals 3,  Banners 
Disk 04 - Banners 2 
Disk 05 - Banners 3,  Business 
Disk 06 - Busines 2,  Computers
Disk 07 - Comic Setter,  Food,  DPaint 
Disk 08 - DPaint 2,  Misc 
Disk 09 - Dpaint 3,  Travel 
Disk 10 - Sport 
Disk 11 - Places, Events 
Disk 12 - Events 2  
Disk 13 - Buildings,  People 
Disk 14 - Female 
Disk 15 - Male 
Disk 16 - Screengrabs (Some are a bit risky.  Over 15`s only)  
Disk 17 - SG Clipart (Drawings I have made. Some are personal, so this
disk will be censored before it is released.)
Disk 18 - Ham 1 (Some are over 15`s only) 
Disk 19 - Ham 2 (Some are over 15`s only)  
Disk 20 - Ham 3 (Some are over 15`s only)
Disk 21 - Ham 4 (Some are over 15`s only)  
Disk 22 - Ham 5 (Some are over 15`s only)

Just ask me for Clipart Disk number xx,  and I wil copy it for you.  I
also  have some other Clipart disks,  which are listed in the Main  PD
Guide,  ie,  Flintstones and Cartoons etc.  Just ask for them  in  the
normal way.

@node sale "The Small Ads Section."

Do  you  have anything that you want to sell? Do you want to advertise
it  cheaply,  and advertise it to a range of Amiga Owners? Well,  this
is  the place for you.  Just write to me with details of what you want
to sell,  and I really don`t mind what you sell,  and I will put it in
the next issue.  Your advert will stay in for as long as you want,  or
until you sell the item,  so remember and tell me it is sold.  I  will
only  hold adverts on file for a maximum of 6 isssues.  If it  is  not
sold  within  6 months,  then it cannot be much of a bargain  can  it?
There  is only one stipulation.  Either pay me a few pound for  typing
in the advert,  or you can give me the advert on disk, either in Ascii
text or an IFF file,  but I would prefer the ascii text file.  I  will
keep the disk as payment.  Please can you only send your adverts on  a
Double Density Disk. I do not really have a need for High
Density Disks.

Wanted - Blank Disks are in great need.  I prefer Double Density ones as
         High Density can be a bit dodgy on the Amiga.  Do you want to get
         rid of all those old magazine coverdisks that are lying at the
         bottom of your drawers?  You do?  Well give them to me!  I can
         use them to buy more Public Domain Disks, which will keep my
         costs down and allow me to buy much more high quality programs,
         which you can swap with me.  Either post me the disks if you are
         feeling generous, or tell how many you have and how much you want
         for them and I will consider your offer.  Please make the price
         cheap, as I want to keep the PD scene alive.  Thanks for your
         help.  I am willing to swap blank disks for blank disk labels, as
         I buy my labels in bulk, so I have loads.

@node pentrisoft "Pentrisoft - Promoting Shareware & Its Authors!"

Below  is  a  text file from the Pentrisoft Members Pack,   which  you
receive  when  you  enquire about joining.  On it is  textfiles  about
Pentrisoft,  the latest Doubleclick, and some Pentrisoft logos for you
to use.

@{b}- What is PentriSoft?@{ub}

PentriSoft  is a non-profitmaking association for computer programmers
whose  aim is to help genuine shareware and freeware authors  of  high
quality programs to succeed in the world market for software.


@{b}- What platforms does PentriSoft cover?@{ub}

In theory,  PentriSoft is for programmers on all computers, but at the
moment,   we can only support those on the Amiga and Apple  Macintosh.
Although  the two 'sections' of PentriSoft share the same name,   logo
and aims, things are kept fairly separate.


@{b}- How did PentriSoft begin?@{ub}

PentriSoft was the brainwave of my friend Stephane Gray.  He is a  Mac
programmer,   and  has  since   enlisted   many  other  shareware  Mac
programmers.  I am now trying to do the same thing for the Amiga.  See
PentriNews_June, or DoubleClick! for more information.

@{b}- How can PentriSoft help programmers?@{ub}

PentriSoft can offer individual programmers a means by which they  can
contribute  to the shareware system as well as providing  the  use  of
advertising,   beta testing and programming tips from  other  members.
Soon,   we  hope to offer some sort of evaluation system,   and  maybe
later  on,  a distribution system,  where programs are advertised  and
distributed  `in  bulk'.    PentriSoft   has  members  with  years  of
experience in programming on the Amiga and Apple Macintosh,  eager  to
offer friendly tips and advice to enthusiastic newcomers.


@{b}- How do I join?@{ub}

Simply  return the questionnaire/Registration file  to  me  at:   

Mark Harman  
3 Highlea Close 
St. Leonards On Sea 
East Sussex 
TN37 7SS 
 
I  will then send you more details,  and maybe put you in contact with
other programmers.  You will not be charged for anything at any  time,
but it will speed up replies if you send an SAE.


@{b}- What does joining PentriSoft involve?@{ub}

By  joining,   you  do not sacrifice any of your ownership  rights  or
programmer fees,  but you do benefit from a network of friendly fellow
programmers,  vastly increased distribution,  and the right to  use  a
symbol  of  software quality that can be displayed on  program.   From
time to time,  PentriSoft may put other programmers, working in fields
in  which  you  have experience,  in touch with you so  that  you  can
exchange  tips and advice about your programs.  Please  note  that  we
reserve  the right to end a programmer's membership at any  time  (but
there'll be no need for that, of course...;)


@{b}- Tell me more about the disk-mag `Double-Click'.@{ub}

Well,   the best thing is to see it for yourself.  Articles  are  very
welcome!

@{b}- I know some other Amiga programmers; how do they join?@{ub}

Get them to write to me (Mark)  at the above address, or better still,
give  them  a copy of this disk and ask them to return a duplicate  of
the  questionnaire (or the registration program if that's what  you've
got).


@{b}- I know some Mac programmers; how do they join?@{ub}

This is important;  do NOT get them to write to me;  instead, ask them
to write to this address:

   Stephane Gray
   Oaklands
   Rock Lane
   Hastings
   East Sussex
   TN35 4NY

He will send them some more details.


@{b}- I know programmers of other platforms; can they join?@{ub}

Well,   no  is the simple answer.  However,  if there was  someone  of
another  platform who wanted to actually set up PentriSoft on  another
platform, then write to me, and I'll see what I can do.

@{b}- More about us?@{ub}

Stephane  Gray,  who originally came up with the idea,   controls  all
things  Mac  related.  Actually,  I think he passed  control  over  to
someone else recently,  but I'm not too sure.  I (Mark Harman)  am  in
control  of  the  Amiga  related section.  I shall  also  mention  Rob
Forster,  who isn't a programmer,  but kindly beta-tests our programs.
We are all 17/18 years old,  studying hard for our A Levels. Who knows
how  we find time to do things like this...  Both me and Stephane have
released  some  PD programs,  but haven't made vast amounts  of  money
from programming (yet?).

@{b}- What Amiga do I own?@{ub}

I  ought to say,  since I'm asking about yours.  I own an A1200,  with
340MB Hard Drive,  which I've recently upgraded to an '030,  with 10MB
of  RAM.  If you're thinking of upgrading,  please do,  it makes  your
life so much better!  I also have a 24-pin printer to slowly churn out
the various bits and pieces.


@{b}-What programming language do I use?@{ub}

I  use  AMOSPro,  so I would especially like to hear from  other  AMOS
users.  Don't worry if you aren't, however; PentriSoft is for users of
ALL  programming  languages.  I  also  know  a  little  C  and  ARexx.
Stephane, by the way, uses something called `Hypercard'.

@{b}- What programs have I written?@{ub}

A  lottery  program  (Lottery Numbers),   a  file  encryption  program
(Protector),  and even a biorhythm program (BioCalc), which are in the
public domain.  I've written various others, but just haven't released
them yet (I just can't be bothered).  And, of course, both versions of
the viewer for DoubleClick!


@{b}- What if I drastically upgrade my Amiga, or Get a New One?@{ub}

The  hardware  questionnaire is only really for beta testing  purposes
(if someone wants to see if a program runs on a particular setup,   or
it  has  higher than average system requirements),  so  it  isn't  too
important.   Having  said that,  I'll always be  interested  to  hear,

You really should not need any help at all with this document.  It  is

many trained chimps, so here goes.

This is just a copy of the normal Amiga Guide Help File.

If  you  wish  to return to this help screen at any time,   then  just

Andy  is  the programmer of the excellent diary and planner,  Remdate,
which  I  of course,  have registered for,  and I suggest you  do  the
same.  He also wrote the game Tetren, which in my opinion, is the best
Tetris style game I have ever seen.  It only has 30 levels,  which you
may  think  is hard,  but you will find it VERY VERY hard to  complete
this game.  I have sent a letter to him,  asking for the passwords  to
the  levels.  I can only get to level 10,  and belive me,  it was hard
going.  You will have to bribe me very much,  as I will be not  giving
these passwords out to anyone,  you know.  This man spent ages writing
this  game.  The least you can do is play it properly.  Note to Andy:-
Is my advertising fee in the post yet!

This  man is also GOD!  At the start of October,  my Hard Drive  broke
down  and  was  completely wiped!  This man came to  my  rescue,   and
supplied  me  with a disk which has saved my computer from extinction!
I can only thank this man from the bottom of my heart.

@node commercial "A list of Commercial Titles I Own"

This  is  a list of Commercial Software Titles I own,  ie  not  PD  or
Shareware titles.

            ******************************************************
            *                                                    *
            * I WILL NOT COPY THESE DISKS FOR ANYBODY - EVER!!!! *
            *                                                    *
            ******************************************************

I do not see why I should jeopardize my life because someone cannot be
bothered to spend money and buy pirate versions of games.   A  lot  of
time,  money and effort goes into writing these titles, as is so often
found in Shareware too.  Why should you be guilty of taking the  bread
from their mouths, as it were.

The  reason of this list is simple.  If you are either stuck on a game
listed,  or are looking for tips for cheats,  or want to know  how  to
perform  a certain task in a utility,  then you can look up the  list,
see if I have the title,  and write to me with your query. If I cannot
help, I know a lot of people who can!

Here goes then:-
