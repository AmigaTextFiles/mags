@{"b"}Internet Explorer vs Netscape...@{"ub"}  

We've just had a new version of Netscape put on the college PCs. As far as I can tell, the only differences are that it takes  three times longer to load, five times longer to quit, and has prettier icons for the buttons... Okay, I guess I shouldn't be slagging Netscape off, given that Microsoft are busy making Netscape go out of business, in their quest for world domination.  I was using a friend's PC, and happily doubleclicked on the MyComputer icon. Whilst moving around the drawers, I noticed how that the window that the files appeared in looked rather like a web browser - it was in fact the latest version of Internet Explorer!  

Apparantely, the idea is to integrate navigating through your hard disk (for those who dislike using the Start button, that is...) with navigating through the web. You might think this is a  neat idea, or you might think that it's bloody pointless, but either way, there is a darker side...  

Now that Internet Explorer is part of the OS (kind of), people  will buy PCs with IE, and use it for both file-managing, and web browsing - bye, bye Netscape. Actually, I heard that some companies are refusing to ship IE with PCs, and Microsoft are saying that they have to, arguing that it is now part of the OS. If they get their way, things will look very grim for Netscape.  

And the deal between MicroSoft and Apple means that all new Macs come with IE, and not Netscape...  

I heard somebody suggest that, given Netscape's situation, they might condider a port to the Amiga - that would be most welcome. Presumably, given the Mac version, a port to Amiga/PowerAmiga wouldn't be too costly to produce, and will easily beat the existing browsers (albeit with higher system requirements).  

If Gateway 2000/AI are keen to produce a low-end Amiga as a sort of network computer or set-top box, then something like Netscape would be pretty much essential. If such a machine were produced, maybe Gateway could do some sort of deal with Netscape to do a port, a bundle it with the machine?

 @{"b"}Note@{"ub"} I have now taken to a particular hating to Netscape, after seeing the shambles it makes of my homepages (members.tripod.com/~Mark_Harman). Can't load png files, completely messes up the tables. IE does it fine, and of course, so do the Amiga browsers...
