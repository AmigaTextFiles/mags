@{"b"}Microvetic Monitor Discontinued???@{"ub"}  

I don't know if this is a hoax, or what, but I found up a mail  order company (I won't mention names) to order the Microvetic M1438S monitor, and they told me it had recently been discontinued, and they had just sold out of stock. The same was true of the 17" model.  

As it happens, I finally got the monitor from Wizard, who were  unaware that it had been discontinued, and were still receiving them from suppliers. Other places had them in stock too, so hopefully this company had been telling porkies...  

Nonetheless, it did get me thinking - supposing the Microvetic  monitors @{"i"}were@{"ui"} discontinued? (I know they are official Amiga monitors, but that's only a licence.) The problem is that these are the only Multisync monitors which are still available for the Amiga, so not having them available would represent just a slight problem.  

Using PC VGA monitors is dodgy, and you lose all the 15kHz modes anyway. Buying a TV monitor (assuming you can, anyway) would not let you have the 30kHz modes.  

It seems a rather dangerous situation when all two of the Amiga monitors are being made by one company. I just hope Gateway  2000 manage to prevent such a scenario ever happening.
