@{"b"}C Tutorial - Part 2@{"ub"}  

There should be some C source code in the Mag5/ drawer under  the name 'Euclid.c'. It's all text based, and you don't need any off the Amiga Includes. You can view the code clicking @{" " link "DC5_Guide1:Mag5_Guide/EUCLID.C/MAIN"} here, if you like.  

This program just uses Euclid's algorithm to calculate the highest common factor of two numbers.  

What is Euclid's Algorithm? I hear you say. Well, first of all, you start off with your two numbers (a and b in the program). We get these from the user with the scanf function. Npw for the algorithm:  

1 - We then stick these into a[1] and a[2] respectively, so that a[1] is greater or equal to a[2] (I know that isn't in the program - more   on that later!)  
2 - Let n=2 
3 - If a[n+1] divides a[n] exactly, then STOP, a[n+1] is the highest common factor. 
4 - Let a[n+2] be the remainder of a[n] divided by a[n+1] 
5 - Increase n by 1 
6 - Goto Step 3 

And that's it. As I said the program doesn't check whether a[1] or a[2] is bigger. Try running the program, and enter a bigger number second - it still works! I'm not entirely sure way this is, probably related to the way the modulus function (%) works, but as it does work, there is no need to check which number is bigger.  

Talking of the modulus, this is how we do remainder division. Look at the line: 
A[n+2]=A[n] % A[n+1]; 
This divides A[n] by A[n+1] and stores the remainder in A[n]. For example, 11 divided by 3 equals 3, remainder 2. Therefore, 11 % 3 = 2. If the remainder is 0, then it divides exactly, so we can stop. 

Anyway, that's enough for now. See you next issue with some more C code (maybe).
