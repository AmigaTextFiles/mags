@{" - Picture - " link "DC5_Guide1:Mag5_Guide/PSoftIMG.PNG/MAIN"}  @{"b"}About PentriSoft@{"ub"} 

@{"b"}History@{"ub"}  

PentriSoft was originally set up as an association of programmers on the Macintosh, by a friend of mine (Steph Gray). This was done in 1995. During early 1996, I proceeded to do a similar thing for the Amiga. Please note that although the two sections of PentriSoft share the same name, logos, ideas and aims, etc, their operation is kept fairly separate!  

PentriSoft consists mainly of programmers, of many languages and levels of experience - we cater for all. I would however be pleased to hear from Amiga users who are not programmers, but may wish to get in contact with some. In particular, I would like to extend membership to: 
    	
    Graphics artists, 
    	
    Musicians, 
    	
    Game designers, or anyone with an idea for a program, 
    	
    Beta testers, 
    	
    People who want to write articles for DoubleClick on a regular basis, 
    	
    BBS Sysops, @{" " link "DC5_Guide1:Mag5_Guide/DISTRIB.GUIDE/MAIN"} especially those willing to put DoubleClick on their BBS, 
    	
    People with a lot of contacts wishing to distribute programs @{" " link "DC5_Guide1:Mag5_Guide/DISTRIB.GUIDE/MAIN"} (like DoubleClick, for example), 
    	
    Anyone with PD software wishing to swap, 
    	
    Editors of other e-zines? 
    	
    and maybe others...? 

Please note that at the time of writing, we are mainly programmers, you can @{" " link "DC5_Guide1:Mag5_Guide/PENTRIMEMBERS.GUIDE/MAIN"} see the current membership list for yourself. This means that the advantages to others getting in contact are not as great, at the moment, but please don't let that put you off writing!  

Oh yes, membership is @{"b"}free@{"ub"} of course. We believe that just by joining, you have as much to offer us as we have to offer you.  

@{"b"}What can PentriSoft offer?@{"ub"} 
 
    	
    Contacts with other programmers to write to, exchange ideas, source code, maybe to write joint programs, and of course, to make new friends ;) 
    	
    Contacts to write to for swapping PD; we may soon have a sort of members-only PD library, where we have a large list of PD where you can write to certain members if you need a particular program. There will be no cost (as long as you provide disks and postage!) 
    	
    Beta testing of your programs by other members, to offer advice, suggestions, and point out bugs. 
    	
    Soon, advertising of your programs in this e-zine, and other members' programs. 
    	
    This e-zine, DoubleClick! Although if you @{" " link "DC5_Guide1:Mag5_Guide/SUBS.GUIDE/MAIN"} subscribe, you will get it as soon as it is complete, remember that it is freeware, so if I or another member is writing to you, we may send you the latest copy anyway. 
    	
    This e-zine (again), in that you will have the opportunity to @{" " link "DC5_Guide1:Mag5_Guide/SUBMISS.GUIDE/MAIN"} submit articles to it easily - of course, you @{"b"}don't @{"ub"}have to be a member just to supply articles, etc! 
    	
    The use of the PentriSoft name and logo in your programs to help us build a reputation (ie, a good one)!
