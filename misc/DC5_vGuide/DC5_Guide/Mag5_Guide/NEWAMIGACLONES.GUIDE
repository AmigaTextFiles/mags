@{"b"}New Amiga Clones!@{"ub"}  

Following on from the Amigo tower kits, Intrinsic Computer Systems are to  release a range of Amiga A1200T clones based on the Amigo.  

The Amigo PC (as it will be called) will appear in various configurations: 
    	
    @{"b"}Storm A1200@{"ub"} - basic A1200T 
    	
    @{"b"}Cyclone A1200@{"ub"} - A1200T with 50MHz 68030 
    	
    @{"b"}Tornado A1200@{"ub"} - A1200T with 50MHz 68060 
    	
    @{"b"}Hurricane A1200@{"ub"} - A1200T with 200MHz PPC603e  

All will come with a choice of 16 or 32MBs RAM, and options such as hard drive, CD ROM, etc.  

An example specification of the Hurricane is given as: 
    	
    Hurricane HC A1200 Tower, 
    	
    200MHz 603e, 
    	
    34MB System RAM, 
    	
    2GB Hard drive, 
    	
    16x CD ROM, 
    	
    Graphics card, 
    	
    Monitor. 
    	
    All for £1699.95   

This could be the first Amiga to actually be sold with PPC processor as standard, and it would certainly be the most high-powered. Admittedly the value is not as good as PCs, but it easily competes with PowerMacs, and is far better that what the Amiga's had previously.

 @{"b"}Latest News!@{"ub"}  

For anyone complaining that these Amigas aren't really 'new', being just A1200 Tower clones will be pleased to know the new Amigas have been released by DCE / Power Computing under an official licence. Details are few at the moment, but there will be to models, one with 50MHz 68030, and one with a 50MHz 68060. They will be upgradable to PowerPC, and come in nice normal size tower cases (unlike the A1200 board which requires a really tall one...) Prices have not been announced, hopefully they will be good.  

Also, the Access machine from Index is now available.  

(This New Amiga Clones section could become a regular feature in DC... I hope so!)
