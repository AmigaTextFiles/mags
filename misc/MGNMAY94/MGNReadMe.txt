Micro Guerrilla News is an AmigaGuide (hypertext) format newsletter,
covering the Commodore Amiga and Commodore 64.

To read this file you must have either AmigaGuide, Multiview or some other
guide viewer program, such as Nick de.Jong's ShowHyp (included).

If you have AmigaGuide or MultiView installed, just click on the MGN icon.
To view the pictures within the newsletter, you will need a picture
viewer Viewtek, Mostra or Commodore's Display or Multiview installed
on your system. 

I have included a script which is based on David Tiberio's script that was
included with Issue 2.15 of Amiga Report. Amiga Report is another (the
original?) AmigaGuide format newsletter, now edited by Robert Niles and has
inspired many other people (including me) to create these
"online magazines." Amiga Report is probably available where you got MGN
from. Issue 2.15 has an article on writing AmigaDOS scripts by David Tiberio
if your interested in learning more.

Anyway, I modified the script just a bit, (there were some errors in the
copy I got for some reason) and it should find whatever picture viewer
you've got. 

If you don't have AmigaGuide or MultiView:

I've included ShowHyp v1.2, by Nick de.Jong, which seems to work on all
Amigas with at least version 1.3 of the OS. To use this, you must use the
CLI. Open a shell window, cd to the drawer or disk where you have
Micro Guerrilla News, and type:

showhyp MGN1.2.guide

This will display Micro Guerrilla News in the ShowHyp window. At the top of
the screen are four boxes: Contents, Retrace, <Browse, and Browse<. These
allow you to navigate through the newletter. Contents shows the table of
contents for a particular section, Retrace brings you back to the previous
section, and the browse buttons are for skimming forward and backward
through the text. The words enclosed in boxes can be clicked on, and will
take you to the appropriate section of text.

Unfortunately, ShowHyp does not like some of the AmigaGuide formatting
commands, so you will see occasional odd boxes, such as b} or ub}. They
look bad, but aren't dangerous, so just ignore them.

Also unfortunately, ShowHyp does not appear to be able to call up the
picture viewer from within the newsletter. You'll have to view the pictures
in a paint or picture viewer program.

While not perfect, ShowHyp at least allows all Amiga owners to view
AmigaGuide files, whether newsletters or program documentation.

If you don't have an Amiga:

Micro Guerrilla News, like all AmigaGuide files, is an ASCII text file with
certain commands embedded in the text. These commands always start with an
@ sign. Anyway, you can use whatever text viewer or editor you have to read
the newsletter. Just ignore all the @{} stuff.
