@{b}Words from MGN's Gadfly Artiste and Editroid
by Dave Matthews@{ub}

Do you remember the avant-guard film/music video "Koyaanisqatsi"? In one
scene, a man stands on a street corner, while everything around him is
speeding around on fast forward. That's what I feel like, these days. It's
been a mere few months since 60 and 66 MHz Pentiums have been available, and
they're already being phased out by Intels new 90 and 100 MHz Pentiums.
These new chips not only run faster, they run cooler and use less energy,
and should be less expensive overall to manufacture, for Intel and for Clone
makers. They also probably are the last nail in the coffin of the 680x0
chips by Motorola, whose chip market has pretty much been crushed by the
Intel Juggernaut.

Apple, Motorola and IBM are banking on the new PowerPC chip to provide an
alternative to Intel based computing. These PowerPC chips are "RISC",
(Reduced Instruction Set Computing) and have many advantages over the more
traditional processors like Intel's Pentium. In general, they offer more
horsepower at a better price. The PowerPC chip also offers addtional
goodies like built-in DSP (Digital Signal Processing), which the new Macs
can use for voice processing or even emulating a modem.

The only problem is a large one indeed. These new RISC chips are compatible
with NEITHER Intel's x86/Pentium line NOR Motorola's 680x0 line. Since you
can't sell even superior hardware without software, this poses a big hurdle
for Apple, Motorola and IBM to overcome. Their answer is "emulation", both
to run traditional Macintosh programs and to run PC compatible programs.

The problem with that is, basically, performance sucks. The new PowerPC Macs
can run most if not all Mac software, but not at anywhere near the level one
might expect from a 66-80 Mhz machine (The PowerPC's emulate a 68020). And
while they can also run most PC programs, it's even worse, with performance
matching low end '386 or even AT systems.

Not many PC people will be lured by "the world's fastest AT", when they can
have a 100 MHz 486 or 90 MHz Pentium for about the same price. Especially
now that most Macintosh software is also available on Windows.

While Intel and Motorola push the boundries of personal computer processors,
the industry, and computer users are faced with a far more serious problem.
The standard AT type architecture is laughably unable to cope with the
demands of todays modern software, much less tomorrows. To meet the needs
of a multimedia oriented society computers have to have great sound, great
graphics and animation, lots of bandwidth, and, MOST importantly, they have
to be easy to set up and use. Things like IRQ and DMA conflicts, 640k ram
limits, unending video and sound driver hassles just don't cut it.

Microsoft's "real-soon-now" Windows 4.0 is supposed to offer plug and play,
but even if it works, will offer very little to those who are not willing
to invest in hundreds of dollars worth of new type of cards, not to mention
the massive RAM and hard drive requirements.

Of course, the Amiga has solved many of these problems already, but sadly,
has pretty much been locked out of the mainstream. It remains to be seen if
these new PowerPC Macs (or the upcoming IBM PowerPCs) can unlock this puzzle.

@{b}The Rumors Among us...@{ub}

Note: These are just rumours, intended as entertainment, and should be 
taken as such.

By now most of you will have heard all the rumours flying around.
Apparently, CBM is virtually out of business. Their stock value has
dropped to pocket change, and they have almost no working capital. They
even stopped trade on their stock recently. They are in negotiations with
their creditors now.

Sony Amiga Makes it Possible? This is the most persistant rumour I've
seen. Sony is supposed to have bought out Commodore. Actually, this could
be quite good news. SONY has many interests which mesh quite nicely with
the Amiga. However, as I write this, no one has bought out CBM (at least
not yet).

Another rumor has it that CBM itself asked that its stock be withdrawn for
one day to scare its creditors into easing up.

Of course, Hewlett Packard is always good for some gossip. Apparently HP
DID buy a substantial amount of stock recently. They also recently inked a
technology sharing deal with Commodore concering the AGA chipset and HP's
plans for a TV Top Information Highway/Multimedia box. Commodore, of course,
has plans to use HP's PA (Precision Architecture) RISC chips future
machines.

The latest "takover of the week" has it that Phillips has bought CBM. While
this is doubtful, Phillips might actually be able to compete in the CDROM
Multimedia market if they did acquire the CD³² technology. On the other
hand, they might also kill the Amiga, so as to have one less competitor
making their CD-i look so lame.

One thing I do know is that the Engineers at Commodore are still hard at
work on AAA, and the next generation of Amigas. As you read this, the
A4000 tower systems are in the hands of developers, and Version 3.1 of
the Amiga OS is finished, and waiting for the documentation to be printed
in order to ship.

It's way too early to panic/rejoice over the latest wave of rumours. I
suppose, one way or another, we will all find out the truth over the next
few months. Until then, might as well be optimistic, eh?



@{b}Are We Having Paranoia Yet?@{ub}

AGE Entertainment Software is pleased to publicly announce today, the
impending release of their first game for the Commodore Amiga computer
platform, Paranoia.

Paranoia is a first-person, scrolling action adventure game which takes
elements from popular role playing games like Dungeon Master and Ultima
Underworld while maintaining action elements usually present in games
more like Alien Breed or Uridium and mixes it all together with elements
from popular science fiction films like Alien and Star Wars.

The player takes the place of a member of the crew from an interstellar
starship which is transporting cargo through the cosmos.  The ship is
attacked by an unknown alien race for no apparent reason, and the ship
is boarded by "Hoarders", creatures which roam the dark hallways of the
ship in search of human prey.  The player must find an escape off this
death trap in an adventure that will keep players on the edge of their
seat all the way through.  Obstacles must be overcome, and puzzles
solved in this epic story of a routine trip gone bad.

Combine all this action and adventure with a mixture of graphics rendered
with NewTek's amazing LightWave 3.0 and digitized clay animation and you
have an experience like nothing anyone has ever seen before on a personal
computer.

Should players succeed in this harrowing mission of mercy, they can
continue on in the story of this lonely crusader in Paranoia 2: Colony.
This story picks up where the first left off, with our hero landing his
escape vehicle on a nearby planet which harbours a colony filled with
mystery. Then, finally, comes the third and last game in the Paranoia
trilogy. Paranoia 3: Revenge goes to the home planet of the "Hoarders"
and takes our hero along for the ride.  Follow amazing plot twists and
unparalleled action sequences in an unprecedented game series.

Paranoia will be available first quarter, 1994 from:

@NODE ADVENTURE "Marc upgrades(?) his A3000"
@TOC "HARDWARE"
@{b}Marc and Dave's Excellent Adventure, Part One
Two Wild and SCSI Guys Install the Odd Hard Drive.
By Marc Hoffman and Dave Matthews
@{ub}
Recently, Marc Hoffman bought a "bare bones" Maxtor SCSI hard drive as
a second drive for his Amiga 3000. We both figured installing it would
be a breeze, after all, the Amiga 3000 has a built in SCSI support.

Our first challenge came when we had to decide which "device ID number"
to set the Maxtor to. The SCSI standard allows for up to seven devices to
be daisy-chained. Each one must have its own unique ID number, which you
set by changing a jumper. A jumper is usually a little block which inserts
over two pins. In the Maxtor's case, the jumper was labeled J602,
and pins 5 through 10 controlled the SCSI ID. The drive came configured
with an ID of 6. To change to an ID of 5, you would move the block
connecting pins 7 and 8 to pins 9 and 10.

The problem was, who knew what the Amiga's controller and internal hard
drive were set to. Well, we figured, we might luck out. So we opened the
case, and mounted the drive in the second floppy drive bay.
It fit beautifully,  as the floppy mounting brackets also fit
a standard 3.5" SCSI hard drive. Cool.

Of course it didn't work. After assembly, the Amiga failed to boot.
Well, luckily, Marc was able to locate his Amiga manual, and lo and
behold, the controller was set to 7, and the original drive was set to 6.
So we changed the Maxtor to device five and proceeded.
The easy part was over.

I knew that you had to "terminate" the last device in a SCSI chain with
a terminator resistor pack. But, where are these terminators, and what
do they look like? Who knows. Neither the Maxtor installation sheet nor
the Commodore manual bothered to label or describe the terminator.
Were we supposed to look for a little metal guy with a bad attitude? 
We tried booting up, and it seemed to work. But mysterious crashes,
failure to boot and other stange behaviour confirmed our suspicion that
the SCSI chain was not correctly terminated.

Well, a call to Computability (where Marc purchased the drive) finally
cleared this up. Terminator are flat rectangular black or sometimes
yellow components with a row of pins. Jeez, what's the big secret?

Click here to see SCSI Terminators-->@{"SCSI Terminators" system "display.s SCSIPIC.IFF"}

Anyway, after removing both hard drives, we found and removed the
original Quantum drive's terminator packs, leaving the Maxtor's in
place. Success at last. A quick trip to Commodore's HDToolbox to
partition and format the drive, and we were set.

Whew! It's amazing what a little knowledge can do. I don't know why
nobody has seen fit to actually label or describe a SCSI terminator,
but it sure would have saved us some aggravation and time.
Well, you heard it here first.

Marc and Dave's Excellent Adventure, Part Two
Hangin' with the ROMboys (2.04, that is)
By Marc Hoffman and Dave Matthews
@{ub}
When last we left our intrepid heroes, Dave and Marc, they had
successfully installed a second SCSI hard drive in Marc's A3000. Or...
so they thought...(Cue the creepy music.)

It turns out that things were not to be that simple. Some of the time,
Marc's Amiga would boot fine, other times it would boot but refuse to
recognize the new hard drive. And worse, occasionally it would not boot
from the hard drive at all, requiring a floppy. There are few things
less appealing than seeing a prompt asking you to insert volume System,
when volume System is a hard drive!

Moreover, HDToolbox kept changing the SCSI ID numbers of the Maxtor!
Sometimes it would report as 5, sometimes as 3. Of course, no one
we talked to could explain what was going on, and in fact, I don't
think the tech guys really even believed us.

Well, following the recommendation of several tech dudes, Marc decided
to upgrade to 2.04, at which time we would install the ROMs, change the
SCSI jumpers, and generally get things working. So Marc ordered his
upgrade from Grapevine, and waited...and waited...and waited.

Finally, after an agravating month, the package arrived. Gathering our
fortitude, we sat down to install the ROMs. I'd like to gloat over how
easy it was to do the upgrade, but I'd be lying like a cheap rug. It was
actually sort of a pain.

The A3000, as you may know, comes in one of those dainty little compact
type of cases. Hey, it looks nice, but talk about cramped quarters! My
friend, Don, the PC guy, used to have a Gateway '386sx in the same
slimline type of case, and working with it was the same rare pleasure.

And of course, where are these ROM sockets? Since ROMs will probably be
replaced more often than say, a surface mounted CPU, Commodore surely
would make the sockets accessible, right? Har. To get at the ROM sockets
requires dissasembling almost the entire computer, including removing
the floppy drive, hard drive and power supply subassembly. Jeeez, CBM,
were you afraid the ROM snatcher's would steal your ROMs while you
slept? Sigh.

Inserting the actual ROM chips was pretty easy. But putting the beast
back together, especially the really fun part where you get to thread
a bunch of cables through a 1/2" crawl space while at the same
time lowering a 20lb drive assembly into place, well, let's just say
"this, I don't need."

As hardware goes, I'm not very impressed. Now, onto the software. Hey!
This is easy...maybe too easy! Actually, Commodore did an excellent job
with their installer program, something a lot of PC people could learn
from.

Ok, now Marc has a beautiful 2.04 machine. The bad news is, the drive is
still acting funky. Now, although the 3000 boots up fine every time, she
won't recognize the second hard drive, until you do a warm boot. Then it
comes up just fine. Hmmmm. Oh well, tune in again, same bat time, same
bat station...



@{b}
Marc and Dave's Excellent Adventure, Part Three
68040 and Goal to Go
By Marc Hoffman and Dave Matthews
@{ub}
Once more unto the Breach! After installing both a second SCSI hard
drive, and 2.04 ROM's in Marc's long suffering A3000, you would think
we would leave well enough alone. But, you would be wrong!

Because Marc is primarily interested in 3D Graphics, he found his stock
16 MHz 68030 to be increasingly untenable. Then when he saw the Creative
Computer ad for Progressive Peripheral Inc's 25 MHz 68040 board for about
$500, his destiny was clear.

After receiving the board from Creative, we set out to install the board,
and also hopefully correct the odd boot problem with his SCSI drive setup.
We even planned to document the whole process with a Polaroid.

How did it go? (Drum roll please)...Not well, folks. Right off the bat,
the disk with the 68040 libraries and utilities was bad. Not just a
read/write error here or there either. This disk was blown seven ways
from Sunday.

GRRRRRRONNNNNNKKK!!! Man, how I hate that sound! Dead in the water
before we even got the hardware out of the box.

I whipped out Dave Haynie's Disk Salv program, but unfortunately, all
the main files were totally corrupted, beyond all mortal help. Perhaps
an excorsism is in order? Actually, speaking of excorsism, in the
June 15, 1993 issue of PC Magazine there is a cartoon by Richard Tennant
that sums up our experience on this A3000 perfectly. Go see it, it's
hilarious.

Worse, this is all happening on Saturday, and McCook is way out in the
boon docks, and Marc lives about 150 miles away, which is a long drive
for nothing. Well, maybe we can get the file from PPI's BBS. Since
I don't have a modem for my Amiga (and that's another sad story), I fired
up the trusty C128, which never lets me down. Alas, Progressive has
progressed beyond their old BBS phone number; they have either changed
the number, or simply abandoned it. We tried a few other BBS's but not
surprisingly, none had any Vendor areas, and most weren't too keen on
unregistered dweebs like us downloading files anyway. We also called
a number of actual human types. While there are a surprising amount of
dealers open on Saturday, most of the technical support people are
long gone. So, after a few hours of futile calls, and head scratching,
our shoulders slump in defeat. One friendly soul suggested we contact
the McCook Commodore User Group for help. Sigh.

Marc finally got through to a tech support person from Creative, who
promised to send a replacement disk right out, so I guess we will try
again in a week or so.

This whole boondoggle took so long, we didn't get to try changing the
SCSI ID jumpers to correct the weird boot up snag Marc's A3000 still has.
So Marc packed up his A3000, his virgin 68040 board, and his unused
Polaroid camera and headed back to Julesburg. Oh well, stay tuned for
another exciting episode of Dave and Marc's Adventures in Upgrade City



@{b}
Marc and Dave's Excellent Adventure, Part Four
The Road Goes on Forever
Installing Progressive's 68040
By Marc Hoffman and Dave Matthews
@{ub}
It's a good thing Kirk, Spock and Scotty didn't have to deal with late
twentieth century technology--the Klingons would have won every time!

As reported last time, Marc Hoffman bought a Progressive Peripherals
25 MHz 68040 accelerator board for his 16 MHz Amiga 3000. Unfortunately,
when it arrived, the setup disk was corrupted, and thus we could not
install the board. Marc called Creative Computers (where he bought
the board), and they promised to send a replacement right out.

They told Marc they had shipped it Federal Express, Tuesday, June 1,
yet it took about two weeks to arrive from California to Colorado. 

Before we installed the '040, we changed the drive SCSI ID numbers as
follows: Quantum boot drive,ID 0, Maxtor second drive, ID 1. This is
recommended procedure for IBM SCSI installations, but it didn't help.
To access the Maxtor, we still need to warm boot right after powering up.
A bad omen of things to come.

Well, Marc installed the software onto his hard drive. And then we
proceeded to the hardware (at last). We unplugged everything, removed
the case, the daughterboard and the drivebay subassembly, revealing
the motherboard. Following the manual, we pried (carefully) a certain
RAM chip out and inserted Progressive's Static RAM chip in it's place.
We then changed three jumpers, J100, J104 and J851.

Oddly, Progressive's manual had the position of the Jumper J102
differently from Marc's motherboard, but since it didn't say anything
about changing it, we left it alone.

Inserting the actual 68040 board was easy. It fits quite nicely in the
allotted space. We then connected the floppy power connector to the
'040 board to power the fan, which involved switching the floppy drive
and Maxtor HD, because the floppy power cable was too short. We then
reassembled everything.

Upon trying to reboot, however, the Amiga choked on the startup
sequence line containing the 68040Init command. Apparently, the
installation program put extraneous quotes around the command, sigh.
After fixing that, the Amiga booted up fine (except for the weird hard
drive thing). Well, we played around for awhile, and then Marc tried
Imagine. CRASH. We Rebooted and tried Wing Commander CRASH. CRASH CRASH
CRASH. No matter what we tried, or how we set the '040 options
(copyback mode on/off etc), it would no longer run for more than a few
minutes.

The Progressive manual warned of this condition, apparently a problem
with a certain DMAC chip (whatever that is). Apparently it overheats on
some 3000s. Progressive states that this is a random problem with early
A3000s. A call to a nearby Amiga dealer tech guy gave us a different
story--according to him, this is a random problem with some A3000s, and
it only bothers Progressive boards. Creative Computers tech guy, however,
stated that all A3000s have DMAC chips that overheat with an '040, and
you need a special DMAC­040 to run ANY '040 board. At least they all
agree that there is a DMAC in the A3000. SIGH.

Worse than that, now we can't even get a divorce! Once we removed the
68040, and reset all jumpers, the 3000 refused to boot, even from a
floppy. Talk about your shotgun weddings!

Finally, Marc reinstalled the board, and it seemed to work. Apparently,
Imagine cannot run with the COPYBACK cache on, and worse, once Imagine
crashed, it took a COLD BOOT (completely turning off the machine) before
the problem was cleared up. At first it appeared most of Marc's problems
were solved. BUT then the hard drives started acting up again, the HD
program kept changing the SCSI ID numbers, requiring resetting the
drives. And before long the 68040 starting crashing again.

My recommendation? Don't buy Progressive's Board unless:

 1> you are a trained technician or
 2> you have a trained technician whom you trust put it in and test it
    (preferably with a few hours of burn in), and one who guarantees
    their work.

Had Progressive included some diagnostic software, we would have stood
a better chance of determining if it was running correctly.
 
At this time, Marc has given in and taken his Amiga to a not so local
dealer (who of course, has his own different opinion as to why Marc's
A3000 is acting up. Nor did he believe Marc's hard drive problem).

As of July 15, more than a month after Marc bought the board, the dealer
has determined Marc's A3000 has a bad motherboard, and is still waiting
for Commodore to ship out a replacement. Apparently the SCSI problem was
a symptom of a flakey board, and the 68040 finally pushed the motherboard
over the edge. Marc also ordered the special 040 version of the DMAC
chip. Hopefully, he will have his computer sometime this century.

I admit I'm no computer engineer, hardware hacker or seasoned service
tech, but I've put (successfully) a lot of hardware in a lot of
computers, Amiga, PC etc, and this just is not right.

If the A3000 had a flaky motherboard, that is one thing. But why was it
so hard to get a straight answer about Progressive's '040 board?
Progressive (if they are still out there somewhere--are they still out
there somewhere?) needs to rethink their product, particularly the
support documentation and programs. A diagnostic program would have
helped quite a bit. Perhaps this explains the cheap price?

And what about that DMAC chip thing? We heard from four or five
presumably competent tech people, and they all told us completely
different stories. What's the deal? Well, kids, tune in again next month,
for the thrilling conclusion (we hope) to Marc and Dave's Bogus Journey!

Marc and Dave's Excellent Adventure, Part Five
A Case Study in Futility, or Marc's Tempestuous
Summer Romance with the 68040
By Marc Hoffman and Dave Matthews
@{ub}
"Nothing Works, and Nobody Cares" - Woody Allen

WARNING! DON'T BUY A 68040 board from Progressive Peripherals Inc (PPI),
before you read this! As some of you may know, Progressive recently has
had a string of bad luck, including a fire which destroyed their
headquarters, all of which has resulted in Progressive's (at least the 
Amiga related stuff) demise.

From personal experience, and talking to dealers and repair personnel,
Progressive had a major quality assurance problem with their 68040 boards.

These boards are often advertised at Blow-Out prices, but before you buy,
better check the fine print: can you get a refund if it doesn't work?

Over the past four Months, MGN has reported on Marc Hoffman's struggles
with PPI's 040 board. I'll recap those struggles, then bring you
"the rest of the story".

Just the Facts: Late spring, 1993, Marc buys a Progressive Peripheral
Inc (PPI) 040 25 MHz accelerator board from Creative Computers.
It arrives, but the accompanying disk with the required 68040 libraries
and files was trashed, so he called Creative Computers and asked for a
replacement disk. TWO weeks and several phone calls later, he finally
received the disk.

We installed the board, carefully following the manual, but after
numerous unexplained crashes, and erratic behaviour, it appeared the
board simply was not going to work. A dozen or so phone calls resulted
in a variety of theories and advice, none of which helped.
And Progressive's tech support was nowhere to be found.

Finally, we decided to give up and took the board out. Now Marc's
A3000 wouldn't boot at all, no startup screen, no hard drive activity
light, no nothing. After further panicky efforts, it appeared
professional help was needed.

Marc took his computer to the Computer Room, in Aurora, CO, with the
upshot being $600 out of Marc's pocket for a new motherboard, and of
course, the 30 day return period for the 040 board had passed
(and Progressive was not answering their phones). Creative Computers
agreed to trade Marc's '040 board for a Mercury 040. Marc didn't really
want another PPI product, but GVP has apparently stopped production on
their A3000 GForce 040 products. So Marc shelled out ANOTHER $400 for
the 28 MHz Mercury 040. 

Guess what? Surprise! It doesn't work! Surprise! Creative won't refund
Marc's Money. Reason? Quote- "There are just some things we won't
refund your money on." Unquote. After numerous increasingly irate phone
calls, Marc received a refund on the original 040, and credit for the
difference he paid for the Mercury, which he spent on a GVP EGS Spectrum
24 Bit graphics board.

Those are facts to date. In my humble opinion, this whole thing was
nothing short of a criminal joke. Progressive handled their business
very poorly, leaving customers in the lurch, Creative Computers fawned
off merchandise they knew bloody well was troublesome, from a company
that was out of business,  without so much as a casual warning, and then
had the gall to refuse a refund. And 1 1/2 thumbs down to GVP for
dumping the A3000 owners in favor of the more "politically correct"
Video Toaster crowd. 

As for Marc, he is thinking about a A4000. You can bet he won't buy it
from Creative!



@{b}Film at Eleven Department:@{ub}
Marc just informed me that his A3000, with the newly refurbished mother-
board, has trashed his Maxtor Drive,or at least the data thereon. After
crashing severely, Marc found his 3000 wouldn't boot at all. Eventually,
it did, but wouldn't recognize the Maxtor drive at all. After going into
HDToolbox, Marc found his Maxtor listed, but it reported a Block size
mistmatch when he attempted to add the drive back to the device list.
Marc called the service tech at Computer Room in Aurora, but it didin't
look good for recovering the data. Marc even called a couple of Hard
Drive recovery places, (if you want to rake in the big moola, get into
this line of work!)

Anyway, as a last ditch effort to determine if the drive itself was
screwed up, Marc removed his orgiginal 50 MB SCSI drive and hooked up
the Maxtor in its place. Amazingly, it actually worked. Apparently the
motherboard is at fault. This is good news for the data stored on the
Maxtor, but it appears the 3000 is in critical condition. It looks like
time for either a new computer, or at least a new motherboard. Stay tuned
for MARC'S MOMENTOUS UPGRADE.

                        The Amiga A1200: Inside & Out
                        Part 2          Feb 10th 1993
             (C)1993 Silicon Synapse Electronics  & John Kamchen
             SSE BBS (204)589-1078  MEGS of AmiTronics hacks.
 
The information contained in this document should not be considered
to be 100% accurate, as I am having a hard time finding anything
official on this system.
 
                                  ---------
 
    After doing alot of phone calling, I was able to obtain the
pinouts for both IDE drive formats (the 2.5" & 3.5").  These come from
Maxtor, and are valid for both the A600 and A1200 (tho there is some
debate as to whether the Maxtor 2.5" drives work reliably on the
A1200).  The pinouts are standard for any IDE drive, so the source
doesn't matter much.
 
    The pinouts are as follows:  (_NAME means signal active low)
 
    Name      2.5"   3.5"    Desc

    As you can see, apart from the power pins, all the signals are
exactly the same.  The ones that say 'not supported yet' should still
be connected. The 44pin connector isn't a normal .1" IDC header, it's
more like .075". I'm still trying to track down the source of these
connectors/cables.  The local computer store should have some of these
around, and I'll have to do 40 solder joints to join it to a normal
IDE plug.  If I come up with a better way, I'll let you guys know.
 
    If you are like me, you will want to use a 3.5" hard drive on
this system, because of the cost of those stupid 2.5" units (they run
about $150 more than the equivalant sized 3.5" drive).  Aside from the
cost factor, there is a storage consideration.  The largest 2.5" I've
heard of is 120mb, but there might be a 240mb lurking around
somewhere.  Myself, I wouldn't put anything less that 240mb in this
computer.
 
* NOTE * The 3.5" drive you use must be an 'LPS' type (LOW PROFILE!)..
  1 inch high
*
   -| There may be a conflict with your warranty sticker & a
  screwdriver |- When I bought my sysytem, the computer has something
  rattling around inside and the power LED didn't work.. plus
  something was wrong with the workbench screen.  These were all valid
  warranty complaints, and I didn't do anything dishonest.  The tech
  checked over the system (the mystery object fell out, the power LED
  worked, but the WB screen was still odd).  I felt stupid, but went
  in with good intentions (the car always starts as the tow-truck
  arrives).  Lucky me, they didn't put another sticker over a screw.
  You too may be just as lucky.  But,taf you take in your system with
  a 'phantom problem', you have to live with the results (such as
  paying the shop fee for wasting their time).  As well, if you damage
  the computer (like cutting wires, bending metal, blowing the IDE
  chip) the warranty is for sure gone no matter what you offer as an
  excuse.
 
    Ever wonder why the drive is put in at an angle?  It's not meant
to look pretty (tho it does).   The reason is simple: SPACE! The
inside on the A1200 is really cramped, what with all the metal
shielding and all.  In a 500, many people bolted the drive to the
underside of the top case (under the vent holes) and it proved to work
very well.  The A1200 doesn't have that option.  Space is at a
premium.
 
  * DO NOT DAMAGE OR DISASSEMBLE ANY ORIGINAL CABLES OR CUT ANY METAL  *
  * You should be able to restore the A1200 to as-new condition should *
  * it require warranty work in that vital first year                  *
 
1)  Remove the floppy drive, make it external.  This is as easy as it
    sounds.  The floppy cable (34 conductor) can be extended by any
    means you see fit.  Simplest way would be to buy a drive cable
    from the local computer store.  The power connector for the floppy
    will be shared with the HD, so look at your needs, and come up
    with something.  The HD is bound to have the normal 4 pin power
    plug.  There will be some soldering done here, keep it neat.  To
    shield the floppy cable, wrap it in aluminium foil & duct tape
    (run the power plug inside the shielding!).  A case from Active
    or Radio shack can house DF0: (make it look nice, eh?).  This is
    better than using a 'shuffle board' system, because it allows to
    keep the external drive port free for DF1-3:.
 
    Install the 3.5" HD in the floppy bay.  Don't lose that angle
    bracket.  The drive should sit really nice, and not be wedged
    against anything.  One thing you have to look out for is that the
    drive connectors (40 pin & power) don't get wedged against the
    sheilding.  You might need to bend the metal a wee bit, but I hope
    not.
 
    Doing it this way has two benefits:  Simple to do (as easy as it
    gets) and should you need to take the machine into the shop for
    repairs, you can dismantle everything, put the floppy drive back
    in place, and close it up!
 
    You still need to get ahold of the Commodre Install disk to use
    the HD.

                 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  WARNING:

Although this is hack is done on several A1200's, and works just great on
these machines, I won't be responsible for ANY damage caused by this hack.


  WHAT YOU NEED:

An external (or internal) keyboard like from an Amiga 2000/3000/4000,
some wire, a plug for the keyboard, a screwdriver, a scalpel , some solder,
a 'fine' soldering iron and a switch.
If you don't have any experience modifying your computer or other
electronics, then this is NOT for you, ask someone who does have experience.


  WHAT WE WILL DO:

We will deactivate the internal Amiga 1200 keyboard MPU and feed the CIA
with the required keyboard signal's coming form the 6570 of the external
keyboard. Since Ctrl-LAmiga-RAmiga won't work with the Amiga 2000/3000/4000
keyboards, we will also build a reset-switch.


  HOW WE DO IT:

First we disassemble the Amiga 1200, if you can't do this: STOP now, this
hack is NOT for you. We need to remove the case, the keyboard, the
floppydrive and (if you have one) the harddisk.
After you did this, you need to remove the tin-cover from the motherboard
so we can access it.

Now take a look at the @{"A1200_Inside-IFF" system "display.s A1200INS.IFF"}.

We first will deactivate the keyboard-MPU of the Amiga 1200.
We need to cut two lines of the U13, pin 13 and 14. The little dot on the
chip indicates pin 1, or use the IFF to locate these pins.
After cutting these lines the CIA (U7) won't receive any keyboard data
(KbdData and KbdClk).

We can cut these pins 2 using the scalpel. If you use a new sharp scalpel,
this won't be a problem. Remember: be patient and do it gently !!
After cutting, we bend the pins a bit further apart, so they won't make any
contacts. Check this with a magnifying-glass !
The Keyboard-MPU of the Amiga 1200 is now deactivated.

We now will deroute the keyboard-data to/from the external keyboard.
This is done by soldering 2 wires from pins 43 and 44 of the CIA (U7).
In order to locate these pins we can look at the IFF again. The dot on the
chip indicates pin 1. These 2 wires go to KbdDat and KbdClk of the external
keyboard like shown in the IFF.

The Amiga 2000/3000/4000 keyboard will need a powersupply, this can be taken
from the floppydrive's powersupply. From here we take +5Volt and GND.
Remember to use a tester to check if this is really +5Volt and GND !
The other 2 lines of the powersupply are GND and +12Volt, +12Volt will be
fatal for you keyboard and computer !! So be carefull !!
We now have 4 wires which must be connected to the 5 pin DIN plug for the
external keyboard. Look at the @{"A1200 Keyboard IFF" system "display.s KEYBOARD.IFF"} for the pin-layout.


At this point the external keyboard will work, but we still can't reset the
Amiga 1200. For this purpose we use a simple switch, which makes contact
when you push it. This will be our reset switch. The switch we find in an
PC-case, for RESET, can be used fo this purpose (if you are building your
Amiga 1200 in a PC-case or PC-Tower!).

Pin 38 of the keyboard-MPU (U13) is connected to /KbdReset (pin 128 of the
150-pins CPU-Slot). This line and GND must be connect to the switch.
Gently solder a wire to pin 38 of U13 and a wire from GND, connect both
wires to the switch, as drawn in the IFF.

After doing this, you can put your Amiga 1200 together again for the first
testing. We won't need the old Amiga 1200 keyboard anymore, it won't
function anyway.
When you test this hack do the following:

1. take a copy of the Workbench and insert it in DF0:
2. switch the Amiga 1200 on
3. from the workbench: open a shell
4. Try typing, if you get a lot of "'"-signs, then you got KbdClk and KbdDat
   switched. Turn the computer off and switch the lines on the keyboard-plug.
5. Test your reset-switch by simply pushing it.

If you have any trouble; begin at the top of this doc and check everything.

Note: Amiga 1000, Amiga CDTV and Amiga 500 keyboard will work aswell, you'll
      need to lookup the pinlayout of the plugs.

      This entire text is typed with an Amiga 2000 keyboard on my Amiga
      1200, which is build in a PC-Tower!

Note: For creating this hack, I took some the pin-info from the
      hack of Gravan A. McCormack (Tetragon@lisa.apana.org.au).

SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

HARDWARE

   ISDN phone line (contact your phone company).
   Amiga 2000/3000/4000.
   Hard disk strongly recommended.
   Phone handset (not included) would be very useful.

SOFTWARE

   AmigaDOS 2.0 or higher

COPY PROTECTION

        None.

MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        Amiga 3000/25, 2MB Chip RAM, 8MB Fast RAM
        1 internal 880K floppy.
        1 Quantum 500 MB internal hard drive.
        2 Quantum 100 MB internal hard drives.
        1 Sony CD-ROM.
        AmigaDOS 3.1.


INSTALLATION

Software installation is done with Commodore's Installer program.
It is very easy to install, and the installation script is very well
documented.  The version of the software in the box is 1.0, but there are
many patches available almost everywhere, or directly from BSC.

The card is a bit hard to plug it in, as the dial does not fit in
the opening. You have to remove the guide for the card. The "jumpers" are
set for USA regulations - you may find in the manual the correct positions
for European standards.

Once the software in installed, you have to set it to the network
type you're using. The board has been successfully tested in the USA, France,
Switzerland, Germany and Great Britain.  It might work in many other
different countries, although nobody has tested it.


WHAT IS ISDN ANYWAY??

ISDN is to an analog phone line like what a CD is to an LP.  An ISDN
line has almost no line noise, and it allows you to transfer data at a much
higher rate than on regular analog lines.

ISDN allows you to use, on a single line, a telephone, faxes (class
4 or lower), visual-conferences, high-speed data transfers, etc.


HOW DOES THIS WORK?

(Note: This may slightly vary from country to country)

ISDN allows you to transmit informations "digitally" instead of the
regular "analog" way.

With each phone line, you get 10 different phone numbers. You may
set one different phone number per device connected to the network.  For
example, you may have a telephone, a fax, a BBS and an answering machine,
all on one line, without any conflict.

ISDN lines may carry two communications at the same time.
Information is transmitted via two B-channels (binary) at 64 Kbits per
second each. There is also a D-channel (data) at 16 Kbits per second which
carries information such as Caller-ID, tax information, busy signal, etc...


THE HARDWARE

In the box, there is one ZORRO II ISDN board, one printed manual,
one 3.5" disk, and a special wire to connect the card to ISDN.

On the card, there are about ten chips (surface mounted), 7 jumpers,
two connectors for ISDN-IN and ISDN-OUT, one connector for a phone handset
(not included), a CINCH connector for Audio-in, and a dial to set the gain.


DIGITAL MODEM

ISDN-MASTER does not allow you to connect on "regular" analog
modems, but you may connect to any other ISDN compatible device.  The
software supports X.75 and V.110 protocols.  X.75 goes up to 64000 baud
(!!), and V.110 goes up to 38400 baud!

The "bscisdn.device" emulates a Hayes-compatible modem and may be
used as replacement for the "serial.device".  As there may be two
connections at the same time, one card has two "units".

The transfer rates are around 7800 cps (tested with TERM 3.4) I also
tried to connect from unit 0 to unit 1 and make a transfer, and I got the
same results! There is NO CPU wait time!!


WILHELMTEL SOFTWARE

I had to "borrow" my neighbour's handset to do this test.  The
software (WilhelmTel) is a commodity which loads when booting.  It contains
four "elements":

- Digital Phone
- Phonebook
- Answering machine
- Phone taxes


DIGITAL PHONE

This software allows you to use your Amiga as a regular phone, with
many useful options, such as:

- Seeing actual phone taxes.
- Having two conversations at the same time.
- Conference mode (you hear both callers, but they can't hear
  each other).
- Mute with AUDIO-IN, allows you to play music to the callers
  directly from your HIFI.
- Redial, Caller-ID, etc...


PHONEBOOK

You may store the most frequent callers, so when they call you,
their name pops up instead of the phone number.  You may choose for each
entry if you want to hear the ring or not, or even to send a "busy" signal
for "unwanted" callers!!!


ANSWERING MACHINE

This is the strong part of the software! You may record any
conversation, you may record the "welcome" message, you may even record one
personalized message per caller, etc...
The quality of the samplings are simply PER-FECT!!!

The size of a sample is 8 Kbytes per second recorded!  You may
listen to the samples either with the handset or through the Amiga speakers.


PHONE TAXES

Prints out a list of all incoming and outgoing calls, and prints the
total money spent.


CONFIGURATION FILES

You may create your own "ringers."  You also may define a ringer and
a message per phone number, and even one special message if the disk is full.


DOCUMENTATION

It comes with printed German manual and German AmigaGuide file.  The
guide is well done, although I couldn't understand much, but the printed
manual is not clear at all.

The board is fairly easy to install and you won't need the manual
too much.


LIKES

- FAST transfers without going down on CPU rates.
- Phone/answering machine option.
- Quality of samples.
- Software really easy to use.
- Mute with injecting an audio source.
- Samples may be converted into IFF with a special software (not
  included).

DISLIKES

- German manual, not complete.
- The board is not approved by any phone company.
- The answering machine software is not "programmable"
  (it will be soon...).
- The software does not accept faxes or regular modem calls.


BUGS

None - the software is still in BETA test and the programmers are
VERY friendly and help a lot.  Further BETA versions are available directly
from the authors as soon as they are released.


VENDOR SUPPORT

VERY GOOD!  Everyone is friendly, they are helpful and they speak
English....


WARRANTY

1 year


CONCLUSIONS

A very good product. You've got to have it!

When I ordered this card, I was expecting to get only an ISDN modem.
It came with this phone/answering machine software and I was really glad to
have it!

ISDN is getting more and more popular, and not only for big
companies. With this card, just about anyone can connect to this wonderful
network. Make a step into the 21th century!

program is in PAL.


COPY PROTECTION

None.
Installs on a hard drive.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

Amiga 3000 / 25
10 meg ram (8 Fast, 2 Chip)
Quantum 50 meg HD
Quantum 425 meg HD
Commodore 1950 monitor
AmigaDOS 2.1


INSTALLATION

Dearchive the files (using "lha" or similar program) into
a directory and you're set.  It makes its own subdirectory.


REVIEW

I saw this announced in comp.sys.amiga.announce and I said to myself,
"I could really use a program like this."  I then downloaded it and tried to
use it.  It dearchived nicely into its own directory and was immediately
available to run.  After starting it the first time, I realized that I would
need to boot in PAL mode to see the bottom of the screen.

Now after using the program for about 2 hours, I find that it is a
very good program for designing digital logic circuits.  I am currently
taking an Introduction to Computer Engineering course and I was easily able
to put examples from the book into the DBB and see them work.  There are
also some example circuits that are neat to see.

Some of the features of this program include, in no particular order:

- multiple user definable clocks
- printing of circuit designs
- various logic functions include 2 and 3 input
- and
- or
- nand
- nor
- xor
- inverters
- input and output indicators
- logic probes
- various flip flops including
- j/k
- s/r
- d
- ARexx port (hmmmmm)
- Many others that I cannot think of right now


DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is online in AmigaGuide format.  You can also get
printed documentation from the Author for $5 (US).  Documents are also in
text and TeX formats.

The documentation is of good quality.  However, it does not teach
digital logic design. You should take a class for this or buy a good book
from Radio Shack entitled "Getting into Electronics" for a start.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

I think that I like the ability to test digital logic circuits
without having to wire them up on a real breadboard.  Also you don't have to
buy the chips to test them out:  you can just use the electronic ones.

I dislike the distance that the elements must be separated by.  It
kind of limits the number of items you can put in.  Also there are only so
many different types of logic that you can make.  (and, nand, nor, etc.)  The
program could use some user definable logic functions (which the author
promises for the next version).

I would like to see a variable sized grid on which the elements can
be placed, user definable logic functions, and a NTSC version.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

Compared to doing this kind of design by hand, this is great.  I
have not seen any other products with which to compare it.


BUGS

I have not found any bugs.  This program runs smoothly.  I did
however crash the program once, but that is because I did not read all the
documentation.


VENDOR SUPPORT

Not applicable.


WARRANTY

No warranty is given (it's freeware, dammit).


CONCLUSIONS

I think that this is a very good product.  I cannot wait for the
next version to be released.

@NODE OKTAGON "SCSI-II Adaptor"
@{b}PRODUCT NAME: Oktagon 2008 SCSI-2 host adapter
REVIEW BY Michel J. Brown
The_doctor@nesbbx.rain.com
@{ub}

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

Oktagon 2008 is a SCSI-2 controller card with up to 8MB of RAM for
the Amiga 2000/3000(T)/4000 models of personal computers.  The card also
functions as a hard card, with supplied mounting hardware.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

NAME:      BSC Broautomation AG
ADDRESS:   Lerchenstraae 5
           80995 Mnchen 50
           Germany

Telephone:  ++49/89/357130-0
FAX:        ++49/89/357130-99

E-mail: None given, although I suspect that there is one.


LIST PRICE

I do not know the list price of the product, but I paid $129.95 (US)
from my local Amiga dealer in Portland, OR, USA.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

HARDWARE

A SCSI-1/SCSI-2 3.5-inch or 2.5-inch form factor hard drive
is required for operation. I have installed a Quantum 1080
Empire SCSI-2 hard drive on my controller card.

No RAM is required on the card for operation, but ZIP style
sockets provide for up to 8MB of Fast RAM. 1X4 ZIP chips in
groups of four, either Static Column or Page Mode, are
supported.

All sizes of hard drives are supported, as long as they
are as I described previously.

The card is processor independent for compatibility, but
a faster CPU probably means faster speed.

Supports all current Motorola CPU's including the 68040.

SOFTWARE

The Oktagon comes with its own HD toolbox, on a single,
autobooting, double-sided, double-density 720K floppy disk.

Surprisingly, it works with all revisions of the AmigaDOS.
All features are implemented with the latest revision of the
OS, while some selections are ghosted out for older
revisions (like AmigaDOS 1.3 and below).

Full functionality is obtained with AmigaDOS 2.1 and above,
yet even though compatible with AmigaDOS 3.0, it doesn't
seem to take advantage of any of the newer features present
in 3.0 as far as I know.  As the Oktagon is a Zorro II card,
this may be the reason for this decision.


COPY PROTECTION

None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

Amiga 2500 (rev 4.5)
2 MB Chip RAM, 4 MB Fast RAM
Kickstart version 37.300, Workbench version 38.35 (AmigaDOS 2.1).

INSTALLATION

Installation is simple, as the Commodore Installer software is
used.  I selected the "Expert" mode, and found most of the defaults to be
standard, so even the "Novice" mode wouldn't be much different. You can even
choose the language in which the installation will occur (English is the
default, while French and German are supported), and if you have AmigaDOS
2.1 or above, locales are also supported. The Amiga Style Guide is completely
supported throughout the entire installation process.


REVIEW

The Oktagon 2008 is a SCSI 1 and SCSI 2 host adapter for the Amiga
2000 family of computers, and supports the A3000T, and the A4000 as well.
The card is packaged quite securely, and comes with the mounting hardware
for the drive, a short, but easily installable 50 pin ribbon cable, and a
power cable.

The documentation is written in a "German first, English second"
booklet labeled "Harddisk Controllers & HD Installation Tools". It was well
written, and includes both a step-by-step and expert installation
description. Throughout the book were suggestions, warnings, and helpful
tips about hard drive installation, use, and maintenance.

After I assembled the hard card, and powered up my A2500, the
installation software had an automatic mode by default (which I don't
recommend, unless you want one single partition), or can be changed to
manual mode (for creating multiple partitions). After selecting the
appropriate mode, you can set the number and size of partitions by using the
intuitive editor. One caveat here, though, is that you must specify the size
of the partitions in blocks, so a calculator is handy.

Once the size and number of each of the partition(s) are set, then
you have to format each using the AmigaDOS "Format" command from a gadget
tool on the requester.  Depending on the size of your drive, this can take
quite a while for large drives, and seems more like formatting a large
floppy than a hard drive.

After formatting your partition(s), you can either install AmigaDOS
(for which there appears to be no utility included), or restore from your
favorite backup program.  One nice feature is the ability to update the
AmigaDOS type through the corresponding utility. You can also save the RDB
contents to a file on a floppy should disaster strike, like a corrupted RDB
sector.

All in all, this is a fine product from a supportive and growing
company, and I would highly recommend getting the card if you are in the
market for a fast and inexpensive host adapter.


DOCUMENTATION

The printed documentation comes in a 136-page, perfect bound
booklet, with the first half in German, the second in English. My
congratulations to the writers for the excellent translation and low
spelling error count. The docs are very straightforward, and cover every
aspect of installation, use, and maintenance. All levels of expertise are
covered, and beginners to experts alike won't be disappointed or confused by
the nomenclature.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

I like the ease of use, the intuitive system that is completely
style guide compliant, and the use of many of the advanced features found on
the more recent AmigaDOS upgrades.

About the only dislike I had was that in order to properly partition
off the hard drive, I had to enter the number of blocks manually. This
requires a calculator, or figuring out manually the size of the partition(s)
in blocks, rather than using the sliding type of gadgets found on other,
more intuitive installation tools, like Commodore's HD Tools.  My suggestion
to BSC: dump the manual entry of partition block size, and use sliding
gadgets with a readout of partition(s) size in megabytes.

One surprise was the inclusion of the program GigaMem. This virtual
memory manager is included in the startup disk supplied, and includes the
documentation, but not the registration. I will give a review of GigaMem
v3.0 in a later installment, after fully testing and evaluating it. As it
sells for $79.95 (US funds) at my local Amiga dealer, it makes for the
frosting on the cake, so to speak.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

I have owned three hard drive controllers and three hard drives in
the past several years, and the Oktagon compares quite favorably. As it
stands, it's easily the fastest and most compatible of the three controllers
I have owned. Unlike previous products, this one was up and running in less
than half an hour, which by my previous experience is a record. The external
25 pin SCSI connector is also a plus, and has provision for both snap-in and
screw-in connectors, while past controllers used only one or the other.

BUGS

None noted.


VENDOR SUPPORT

Full addresses and phone/fax numbers are supplied, but the hotline
for technical support is sent back only after registration card is received
by BSC. I am not associated with the vendor in any way other than being a
satisfied customer of BSC/Alfa Data.


WARRANTY

Full one year warranty on parts, and the installation software.
Warranty appears to be transferrable, as no mention is made about the
transfer of title to warranted merchandise.


CONCLUSIONS

This is an excellent product at a fair price.  Considering the
performance capabilities exhibited, I would hazard a guess that the faster
your machine, the faster the throughput. According to SysInfo 3.14, I get
2.5 MB/sec reads, and 2.48 MB/sec writes.  Diskspeed 4.2 also gave very high
marks, and I will UUencode the tabulated results to anyone with a valid
E-mail address, if requested. Seek speed showed my drive had seeks of about
6 ms from beginning to end of each partition, and 2 ms average seek from
adjacent tracks, and 4 ms for 8 random seeks on 90 percent of the drive. It
would appear that faster processors coupled with faster drives will produce
the best results, naturally enough, but faster than your average comparable
equipped host adapter. I'd give BSC and Alpha Data (the manufacturers) a
rating of 4+ stars out of 5, and a full five stars if they make the
appropriate changes to the partitioning software.

@NODE OPINION "Ed Becerra's Page"
@TOC "MAIN"
@{b}Computers, Privacy & Civil Disobedience.
Opinion by Ed Becerra@{ub}

First, a statement of the problem, folks.  Then, what computers 
have to do with it & what it has to do with us, O.K.?

There's been a lot of talk about privacy in the information age, 
especially from human leftovers & relics from the '60's.  
Granted, they can be annoying, particularly when they holler 
about freedom & all you're interested in is keeping yourself & 
your family safe in an increasingly UN-safe world.  In streets 
full of Russian surplus AK-47's, crack, Uzi's, ice, Saturday 
Night specials, cat, 9mm pistols, crystal meth, and other such 
things, the common man is far too terrified to worry about issues 
that seem far away & unimportant.  What HE'S (or SHE'S) worried 
about is how to avoid being cut down in a drive-by shooting, or 
getting whacked by a disgruntled employee who returns to work 
with an M-16 & a bag full of ammo.  He/She wants to keep their 
kids off drugs, & in a school that is reasonably safe, a school 
where they don't have to worry about their little darling getting 
caught in the crossfire between the Crips & the Bloods shooting 
it out over who has the rights to sell drugs in that particular 
playground.

There's nothing wrong with their fear.  It's a very real 
occurrence in the world today & something that we have to deal 
with.  But there's another danger that most people don't seem to 
be noticing.  And that's the danger of trading your freedom for 
safety.  Allowing the government to rule every aspect of your 
life in return for a guarantee that you don't have to worry about 
anything anymore, because Big Brother will take care of all your 
problems FOR you.

Well, if that's what they want, that's up to them.  But kindly 
leave the rest of us ALONE, Thank you very much!  If you're so 
terrified of freedom & life in general that you want to a safe 
slave rather that a free man whose life is always in danger, 
please, go ahead!  (And let's make no mistake here, folks.  If 
you're a free man, taking care of yourself, danger large & small 
will always be out there, waiting.)

Just don't drag the rest of us with you, O.K.?

So, enough with the soapbox....

What do our computers have to do with the problem?  Well, aside 
from the I.R.S. and the covert intelligence community, (Can you 
say C.I.A., children?  Good, I knew you could.), the largest user 
of computers in the U.S.A. is the DMV.  Yeah, that's right, the 
Department of Motor Vehicles. All 50+ of them.

Just recently, an article in WIRED magazine pointed out that if 
you have an over-due library book in Wisconsin, you can LOSE your 
driver's license here in Colorado or Nebraska.  How?  Here's how 
it works....

A great many communities, and for that matter, whole states, are 
trying to solve their legal problems with people's driving 
permits.  We seem to have forgotten that the right to drive a car 
ISN'T a right after all.  And unlike passing a new law, which 
requires the approval of the voting public, the loss of your 
driving permit for any of a number of reasons is merely a matter 
of writing up a new regulation.  An example of this is 
Wisconsin's little stunt.  In this state, failure to pay any 
state or city fine will result in the loss of your license.  Any 
fine!  Get ticketed for failure to shovel your sidewalk, for 
over-due library books, junk in the front yard, anything like 
that & you lose your license.  If, that is, you should fail (or 
refuse) to pay your fine.  Wow.  And since other states cross co-
operate, Nebraska, say, will pull your Nebraskan license at 
Wisconsin's request.

Works with Kentucky, too.  The great state of Kentucky is using 
this little trick to keep kids in school & off drugs.  How?  
Let's see.  Follow me, children.  Under Kentucky's "high school 
drop-out law" of 1990, students who drop out, have nine or more 
unexcused absences, or who become "academically deficient" 
(failing to pass at least four of their classes, say) lose the 
right to drive unless they can prove that family hardship on 
their part REQUIRES them to drive.

In Oregon, any child convicted of drinking, drug possession, or 
caught with a firearm in any public building loses his/her 
license until the age of 17.  After 17, if caught again, they 
lose it again, until their 18th birthday.  Interestingly enough, 
of the 109 different offenses that can lose you your license, 
only 27 of them are traffic related.

The driver's license has become something it was never intended 
to be: A badge of good citizenship.  Pay your bills to city and 
state, pay your child support, don't get caught using drugs, stay 
away from those nasty old firearms, and the state will let you 
keep on trucking.

And all of this was made possible by the rapid transfer, sorting, 
and cross-referencing of information that can only be done by 
computers.  If the various DMV's suddenly lost their computers, 
(or the IRS, the FBI, the CIA, NSA, or the Financial Crimes 
Enforcement Network a.k.a. FinCEN, or any of a number of the 
alphabet soup gang living in Washington, D.C.), they'd be as 
helpless as a blind, deaf, quadriplegic, coma patient in a 
hospital straight-jacket.  Something that a lot of us would wish 
on the IRS, at least.

And there is one solution to this problem that will occur to 
every teen-age hacker & cyberpunk out there.  An ugly solution.  
Viruses.  Like I said.  Ugly.  After all, we're supposed to be
* RESPONSIBLE ADULTS * here.  Yeah, right.  Yet, if the legal, 
political methods fail us and Big Brother wins the right to spy 
on us & control our lives all by using a combination of computer 
power & loopholes in the law, what then?  No matter HOW much we 
despise the socially irresponsible vandals who write these 
destructive little programs, we may end up needing their help!  
Thoreu recommended civil disobedience towards an unjust 
government.  Well, viruses, logic bombs, trojan horses, and worms 
look like they'll become the new weapons for those who oppose a 
government, for whatever reasons.

And effective weapons they'll be.  Robert T. Morris, with a worm 
less than 48 kilobytes in size, managed to disable some 2000 
computers on the Internet.  The scary part is, he intended it as 
a joke.  He meant to do no serious damage.  Think of what he, or 
anyone else, could have done if they had malicious intentions.  
Nasty.

I really HATE the thought that someday I might find myself on the 
same side as these vandalistic idiots, but politics can make for 
strange bedfellows.  And should we need this sort of weapon 
against the government, we'll need it desperately.

Better buy all the anti-virus protection you can, folks.  And 
back up your data as often as you can.  Daily, if possible.  Life 
on the nets is about to get a lot more complicated.  And for some 
of us, dangerous.

Bye for now, folks. See you next month.  Sleep easy.  It's 
probably your last chance to.  Hee, hee, hee.

Review by Dave Matthews@{ub}

Sometimes the little things can make the biggest difference. One of the
reasons I like Loadstar is their constant attention to details, and the
fact they're always trying to improve.

One of those improvements is offering their product on both the 1541 and
the newer 3.5" 1581 disk format. Loadstar is the only company I know of
that took the effort and expense to support the 1581 format directly. I
don't know how many 64 and 128 users own a 3.5" drive (either the 1581 or
CMD's new FD-2000 or FD-4000 series), but it's a major step, and once again
shows Loadstars committment to the 64 and 128. Of course, Loadstar still
supports the 1541, and those owners don't get cheated, even though the 1581
has much more storage space than the four sides of a 1541 disk. All the
`meat and potatoes', programs and documentation etc, that are on the 1581
are on the 1541 disks. On the other hand, the 1581 issues usually contain
some filler material, extra source code, stories, subscriber's Forum.

Loadstar 118, my first 1581 format issue, starts off with Fender Tucker's
essay on inspiration. Fender's articles and essays and soliloquies are
always worthwhile reading, and elevate Loadstar from just another disk of
the month to a real magazine.

Jeff Jones' Soapbox provides the streetwise attitude to Fender's off the
wall wisdom. In issue 118, he takes a hard look at PC's, and what they're
coming too.

Zero Page is a column devoted to learning the 64, inside and out. Usually,
it's divided into three articles, BASICS, which cover neophyte level stuff,
BYTES, topics for the advanced dudes and dudettes, and BITs, which, not
surprising is for the hackers out there. This issue, BASICS has a list of
Commodore specific books put together by Don Craig, BYTES covers converting
those pesky Print Shop graphics from IBM to Commodore, and BITS, as is
appropriate for MGN's hard ware issue, is Fender's hardware hack for getting
rif of those annoying printer interface wires which connect to your
cassette port, and (when not busy getting all tangled up) provide power to
interface.

In the ever popular Brainware section, first up is a quiz on Hieroglyphics,
those intriguing Egyption inscriptions, done by Rick Hephart. Letter Drop
is Robert Markland's computer version of these popular pen and paper
puzzles, and Letter Drop Maker, also by Robert Markland, is a little program
to create said puzzles for your long suffering friends to solve. Barbara
Schulak serves up the usual Puzzle Page, with a cinematic theme. Now, I'm
not much of a puzzle fiend, really, but even if you don't like puzzles, be
sure and read the intro text, written by that Scourge of Banality, Fender
Tucker. Final, Barbara Schulak winds up the BrainWare section with Movie
Gram 118.

Moving right along, in the FunWare section, Tony Patenaude creates some
new and devious mazes for Jon Mattson's scrolling maze game. Jon Mattson
also presents Maze Chase Maker, which, not surprisingly, lets you create
your own mazes for this game.

If you're tired of the average flight simulator, how about taking the
place of an air traffic controller? Airport '94, by Dave Moorman,
puts you in the control tower.

HelpWare has Loadstar Catalog, by Jeff Jones. This database of Loadstar
issues let's you quickly search through back issues.

Steve Emsley's series of game (helpers | cheaters) continues in this
issue with patches for Chomp!, Cyberworld and Double Dragon II amongst
others.

Also in helpware is another of those amazing Euro Demos, Chaos 101
provides a brief education on fractals and Demo making philosophy of
Elwix, the creator of this demo.

Stereo is the theme of this months MusicWare. Mark Dickenson's
StereoPlayer 10.3 has numerous features for maximizing your 64's
SID music Prowes, including support for StereoSID songs. These are
six voice songs, created for the SID Symphony cartridge, which adds
another SID chip (and thus six voices) to your 64. I believe CMD still
sells these.

To go along with the player, of course, are a pile of stereo songs, by
Dave Marquis and Diane Bryan. Even if you don't have the Stereo
Cartridge, these still sound amazingly good.

In the GrafixWare section are another horde of those pesky Print Shop
images, this time in a naval theme. Greg Scheidler presents a program
for printing up to 100 of the little images, on Epson or SG printers.

Finally, Jan Logsdon and Charles Hogarth present some GEOPaint clip art
of playing children.

How I removed Stacker from my PC and Lived to Tell the Tale
by T.J. Maddock
@{ub}
Stacker is a popular "on-the-fly" file compression package. While it does
what is says, it also creats enough problems that I decided to remove it.
For any brave Stacker owner who wishes to remove Stacker from his or her
system, my first recommendation is to find someone to buy your Stacked
PC (hopefully not someone you intend to keep as a friend!), and then just
buy a new computer. Seriously, after you add stacker to your system, it's
pretty much "till death do us part."

I read four or five reviews of Stacker before the purchase, and not one ever
mentioned all the hassles Stacker will cause you. It doesn't like QEMM and
other disk and memory optimizers, it made my hard drive rather unreliable,
it uses up precious memory, and it makes upgrading really difficult.

The Stacker manual has lots of info on setting up Stacker, but very little
on removing it. I don't have the emotional fortitude to detail every
tedious step but here is an overview of removing stacker. I had Stacked
the Original C: boot drive, resulting in a compressed C: partition, and an
uncompressed D: partition.

First, I backed up all my files, programs and data. Second I made a floppy
system disk in case anything went wrong (it did). I somehow lost a whole
directory of TrueType Fonts. They just disappeared. Picture a grown man
having a temper tamtrum in front of his computer.

Next I Used SREMOVE to kill the stacked drive. My Stacked C: drive was now
history. My D: drive (under Stacker) is now C: (sigh). It had enough files
to boot, but all my other programs and data were gone, except for the
backups I made to floppy disk. I edited the autoexec.bat files to remove
all references to Stacker, and rebooted, and crashed, and edited some more
and rebooted, and again until I got it right. There's several references
to Stacker in the autoexec.bat and config.sys files which must be deleted
(carefully).

Finally I got my PC back, and I copied all the files back to drive C:.
Then, I had to re-optimize everything with QEMM, which is actually MUCH
easier without Stacker.

Stacker is almost worthwhile (missed it by that much!), but it just made
my PC too jerry-rigged and fragile for my tastes, and now, just when I
get everything back to normal, Chairman Bill wants me to use upgrade to
DOS 6.0 with DoubleSpace? Yeah, right.

P.S. I hear Stac Electronics won their little ($120 million) lawsuit against
Microsoft. I guess this means no more double space. I never thought I'd be
saying this, but thank you Stac! On second thought, even though Stac won,
I'm sure no good can come of mixing computer weasels and lawyer weasels.
So...never mind!
