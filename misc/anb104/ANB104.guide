COMMODORE BIDDERS KEEP QUIET

- Following Commodore International's decision of voluntary, protective
liquidation under the laws of the Bahamas, rumours - and possible fact -
has continued to surface over who is interested in taking control of Amiga.

Earlier suggestions that Sony or Philips were up at the front have died
down completely, with electronics giant Samsung now emerging as the clear
favourite.

Other names which have been since mentioned include Acer (who market PCs
under the Commodore name), Amstrad, plus much more speculative ideas of
Nintendo and even a Far Eastern duo merging and then taking over C=
remains.

Utilties Unlimited's Jim Drew, the man behind Emplant emulator board, urged
dealers, developers and third parties to get together to bid for the Amiga.
"Commodore kept it the best computing secret of all time, I think it's time
to let the cat of the bag", he wrote.

His goals were to obtain hardware rights, re-start manufacture,
advertising and offer to port PC and Mac killer applications for minimal
cost. Development of new machines would also continue.

Within hours, he claimed, hundreds of e-mail letters and four paper rolls
of faxes had arrived: "This is the type of support we need!"

Meanwhile Commodore UK and Germany have been trading as usual, shifting
remaining stocks and waiting for the time of an official announcement of
who will collect the names.


CLEARER IDEAS EMERGE

Here is a selection of collected reports which help to build a credible
picture of events since of last issue, and the current runners.

@{b}Jeff Walker@{ub} [jwalker@cix.compulink.co.uk], publisher of Just
Amiga Monthly, May 4, wrote:

 Here's some useful facts that Andrew Farrell (Editor of Australian
 Amiga Review) has winkled out:

 Andrew spoke with Electronic Design yesterday and confirmed the
 information they gave him with other Amiga product distributors in
 Europe. The information is first hand from Commodore Germany's
 Marketing Director, and Managing Director - He got the same message
 from several reliable sources.

 They all said that according to Commodore Germany, an Asian or
 Japanese company is in the throws of finalising arrangements to buy
 seven companies, including Commodore-Amiga UK, Commodore Germany,
 Italy, and Canada. Commodore Germany are saying the transaction should
 be finalised within 10 days.

 They were not able to name the company.

 Some sources are saying Commodore Asia-Pacific management has
 suggested staff look for other work. They are almost completely out of
 stock, and appear to be unlikely to ride out the time between now and
 when any official announcements are made. Additionally, Compu-Aid, the
 company responsible for supplying spare parts and warranty support in
 Australia have been hurt by the collapse of a major retail chain in
 Australia (Brashes) and it is possible they may face closure. The
 Amiga situation downunder is poor. Confidence amongst dealers is fair.

 Andrew also rang Commodore Business Machines West Chester number and
 tried to speak with Hock Tan. Instead of being transferred to his
 number, the call was taken by a security person who said something
 about another office closing, and that this office would also be
 closed within a couple of days. To make matters worse he said
 "Commodore is history".

 Commodore UK's MD was too busy to accept calls, but a local software
 publisher said consumer confidence was excellent (most are not aware
 what is now happening) and dealer confidence was still very strong
 despite their knowledge of Commodore's problems.

 A GVP marketing person Andrew spoke to also sounded optimistic when he
 spoke to him directly yesterday.

@{b}Frederic Botton@{ub} [fbotton@cix.compulink.co.uk], May 10, wrote:

 I've just talked to C= Germany by the phone to get some news. The
 girl told me first she wasn't allowed to say who were the Asian
 Investors... I used my French charm to talk of other various things,
 and managed to make her say "Yes, this is Samsung who is heavily
 discussing with C=.

 "The reason why Samsung is willing to take over C= is because they have
 troubles selling their PC clones like many other Asian companies, and
 thus want to try a new type of computer on the market.

 "The Samsung representatives, including some HP personalities said they
 will keep producing the actual Amiga line, keep development  by modifiying
 the actual high-level range to meet the customers demand. They are also
 discussing the possibility of licensing the Amiga technology to GoldStar
 for example... Samsung's weight was nearly $50 billion worldwide in
 '93..."

 She was obviously reading it, so I guess this could be true!  Well, I
 just hope so...

@{b}Gilles Bourdin@{ub} [gilles.bourdin@ramses.fdn.org], May 15, wrote in
the comp.sys.amiga.applications newsgroup:

 New investigations but few news...

 Things apparently are going their steady way between Commodore and
 Samsung. After visiting the german subsidiary, the Commodore-Samsung
 staff went to West Chester and to England last week. The Philippines plant
 was also visited, it's actually quite conceivable that it will be kept at
 least for the beginning, when production will have to startup again
 quickly and at full  speed to meet the unfulfilled demand of the previous
 weeks.

 Sorry for those who are waiting for official announcements, but it might
 last another 3 weeks (according to Alwin Stumpf) until everything is
 completed.

 Alwin Stumpf, who seems to be a key person in this procedure sees things
 very positively.

 The German press, to which Commodore Germany gave oral informations, is
 now  reporting the "old" news that "Commodore is in negociation with an
 Asian investor for the complete buyout of the company". "The investor
 imposed drasctical conditions among which were the liquidation of some of
 the 35   subsidiaries that weren't profitable." There has been no official
 mention of the name Samsung yet.

 Production hasn't been restarted yet and Amiga computers as well as spare
 components are becoming quite hard to find in some countries. Let's hope
 the takeover procedure won't take too long, the actual situation is
 hurting  an already small market. Not to mention what's left of
 Commodore's reputation...


OTHER RUMOURS CAUGHT IN THE USENET

@{b}Robert C. Merritt@{ub} [rcmerrit@apgea.army.mil] said that last month's
Nintendo annoucement that they will release a 32-bit system before the end
of the year, could add up to them buying the CD32. Project Reality, he
says, has been delayed, and they are buying in a system "already developed
and ready."

@{b}Joe Hobson@{ub} [jdh@dagobah.hczoo.com] said:

 The "Asian co" that is interested is Samsung. That is FACT. It is unknown
 if they WILL buy C= out but they are interested. and have already had a
 big meeting. Even NewTek was in this meeting.

 If Samsung buys them, and advertises then Amiga has a huge chance at a
 rebirth! I've also heard and READ that the names "Amiga" and "Commodore"
 will be transfered. Watch for the official news if this deal goes through.

He mentioned that the Scala InfoChannel 4000 was to report Samsung's
interest on May 5.

@{b}Gareth Bull@{ub} [bull@vaxc.cc.monash.edu.au] continued along this
line:

 "Someone, *possibly* C= Asia/Pacific, who are the C= distributors
 for Australia and New Zealand, has been telling Australian Amiga dealers
 that Samsung has bought C= (as of May 7th). Samsung was the company that
 made C='s monitors, and was one for C='s biggest creditors as a result.

 My source for this is an Australian Amiga dealer who has repeatedly given
 me reliable information in the past. At this stage, I have no significant
 reason to doubt what I have been told by this person.

 Apparently, C= owed/owes Samsung megabucks (Samsung has been making
 C='s monitors for a while now). That's all that I've heard so far.

@{b}jcupp@BIX.com@{ub} spoke of the InfoChannel 4000 video dealers' news
show:

 Monday's program is quoting Karola Bode spokesperson for Commodore Germany
 that an Asian investor is interested in purchasing Commodore and the names
 "Commodore" and "Amiga" and that more details will be released in mid May.

 The story goes on to say that Channel 4000 has discovered in conversations
 with foreign distributors and C= insiders has confirmed that the Asian
 buyer is indeed Samsung.

 Channel 4000 also quotes an un-named Commodore insider that the chances
 that the deal will happen before the liquidation is about 50-50. Talks
 have progressed to the point that reps from several of C= foreign
 subsidiaries have been meeting in West Chester for several days.

 Tim Jenison of NewTek has also been involved in the meetings, making a
 pitch on NewTeks future. Looks like somethings going to happen, something
 wonderful? I don't know.

@{b}Steve J. Lombardi@{ub} [stlombo@acm.rpi.edu] came up with a more
unlikely fate, saying that a friend with" high level contacts abroad" had
details that Mitsumi and Sansui are in the process of one of the largest
corporate mergers in history. "In the process they will acquire
Commodore as has been rumored here the past few days. This new mega
corporation will be known as Bahbabui."

Place your bets!

NEWTEK RELEASES AWARD WINNING LIGHTWAVE 3D GRAPHICS AND ANIMATION SYSTEM
AS STAND-ALONE PRODUCT

Topeka, KS, May 20th, 1994 - NewTek, the makers of the Emmy Award winning
Video Toaster, today announced the release of a stand-alone version of
their powerful and popular LightWave 3D modelling, rendering, and animation
system.  The package will be available for Amiga computers in NTSC or PAL,
with 8megs of RAM, a hard drive, and Workbench v2.04 or greater.
LightWave 3D, which has previously only been available as a part of the
Video Toaster system, will list for $695.00US.

"LightWave 3D has established itself as the professional standard for 3D
programs," said NewTek President Tim Jenison.  "After being used on
television shows like Babylon5, seaQuest,Robocop: The Series, Unsolved
Mysteries, The X Files, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and by tens of
thousands of other Toaster users, it's become the 3D software professionals
look to when they need to get work done."

The LightWave 3D package is a full featured 3D graphics and animation
system.  It is renowned for its easy to use interface, which gives users
quick access to a wide range of powerful features.  LightWave 3D's spline
based key framing system allows fast creation of motion paths, while other
features such as envelopes, skeletal deformation, and displacement mapping
allow virtually every element in the scene to be animated.

LightWave 3D features a powerful rendering engine, capable of 16.8 
million color, ultra high resolution output and extremely fast render
times.  It also features such high end rendering options as lens flares,
anti-aliasing, full ray tracing, motion blur, and depth-of-field effects.
It has extensive texture control, including five types of image mapping,
a variety of procedural textures such as water ripples, and the ability
to animate textures.

For the creation and modification of 3D objects, the package also includes
LightWave Modeler, which provides power features such as eight independent
work layers, spline curve modeling, and Boolean operations.  The Modeler
supports PostScript text, the ability to trace over a background image,
and freehand drawing capabilities.  There is also a macro function that
allows users to automate functions such as the creation of particle
systems, or the automatic beveling and centering of text for a 3D logo.

NewTek is also creating a new, updated manual for LightWave, which will
be mailed to all registered LightWave 3D owners upon its' completion.
For a limited time, NewTek will also include a copy of Desktop Image's
acclaimed instructional videotape, "LightWave Essentials," featuring
LightWave 3D expert Lee Stranahan.

By releasing LightWave 3D separately from the Video Toaster, NewTek is
making it possible for anyone to enter the world of professional 3D
graphics, as well as allowing current Toaster owners a cost effective
way to add additional LightWave 3D rendering power.  "One of the reasons
for LightWave's stellar success has been the fact that LightWave 3D
author Allen Hastings and Modeler author Stuart Ferguson are both 3D
artists," said Jenison.  "They know what they want in a program, so
they're constantly evolving the ultimate 3D graphics package.  This
is another step in that evolution."

LightWave 3D for the Amiga is scheduled for release June 15th.

Subject: DICE C development system for sale

May 1, 1994 - Cary, NC -  Obvious Implementations Coporation announces
DICE 3.0, by famous Amiga Gurus Matt Dillon (freeware author), Andy
Finkel (Amiga OS), John Toebes (Software Distillery) and Bryce Nesbitt
(Amiga OS & Enforcer).  This programming system is intended for use by
programmers at all levels of expertise.

        The DICE compiler is part of an integrated "system" of programming
tools designed to ease and speed creating programs for the Amiga.  For
beginners, DICE offers an intuitive visual approach to creating programs --
and numerous examples.  For programmers at all levels, DICE integrates
seamlessly with text editors, offering tools and information at the touch
of a button.

        The new DICE focuses on _productivity_.   The DICE system focuses
on getting code from keyboard to execution as quickly as possible.  It
gives programmers a quick development cycle and fast compile time
so they can try new things quickly.  It brings all help online to
save programmers from flipping through the manual.

DICE 3.0 includes:

    o Complete 450 page manual, including a section on avoiding the most
      common programming pitfalls.

    o Full, fast, online help available in under a second.

    o A complete visual compile environment (fully configurable  to provide
      a visual environment for any program).

    o All the updates, fixes and enhancements you'd expect to the
      original.

    o ANSI compatibility.

    o Romable code generation tools.

    o Source code management tools.

    o An easy to use full source level debugger -- with the most asked-for
      features
 
    o A compression system for use on floppy disk systems.

    o Two powerful Arexx-aware programmer's editors

    o Full source code for the libraries and dozens of examples.

    o AmigaOS 1.3, 2.0, and 3.0 libraries and include files.

    o ANSI, Unix(TM) compatibility, and Amiga link libraries.

    o A package of "bonus" tools to help find bugs in your code.

    o Error messages in German, French, or English.

The new DICE is fast, inexpensive, easy, fun and works on any Amiga,
including floppy disk systems.

DICE is only $150.  SAS/C owners pay $95.  Students pay $85.  Owners
of the registered version pay $75, and students who own the registered
version pay just $65.  Add $5 for international shipping.

Subject: Mac v4.3 emulation


Changes to V4.3 (05/04/94)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New sybil.library.  Corrected trackdisk lockup problem when floppys are
  released.

* New multi-os.device.  Corrected a problem with a vertical blank interrupt
  causing problems with normal floppy operations, including CrossDOS.
  Also fixed a problem with the emulation not recognizing a disk inserted
  BEFORE the 'Start Emulator' gadget was clicked.

* Corrected problem System 6.7/7.0 when using 040 processors with the caches
  left on.

* Added support for AMIA, Utilities Unlimited's latest product (allows real
  800K MAC drives to be used with your Amiga).  You can now read/write those
  real low density MAC disks during the emulation if you have AMIA and a real
  MAC compatible drive.  AMIA sells for only $59.95.  We also carry Fujitsu
  MAC compatible drives at $129.95.

* Created new PicassoQDVideo and PicassoVideo drivers.  These new drivers
  do not conflict with Picasso promoted screens or each other.  Please
  understand that due to accessing the Picasso hardware at a level lower
  than the Picasso libraries, the 'direct' (those with a predefined size)
  video drivers will never be compatible with other Picasso screens.

* Corrected a problem when attempting to start in 24 bit mode with too much
  memory.. the program would crash.

COMMODORE LIQUIDATION
---------------------

Along with all the other Amigan's that got the word that Commodore had filed
for voluntary liquidation on April 29th, I was deeply saddened by this news.
What this means for the future of Amiga technology still remains to be seen.
It is everyone's hope that another company will buy the rights to manufacture
and distribute Amiga hardware and software, and that the Amiga as we know it
will continue to survive and evolve.

With Commodore gone, the continued existence of strong and vital channels for
organization and distribution of freely redistributable software is more
important than ever.  Please be assured that I will continue to support the
Amiga via my CD-ROM distributions for as long as there continues to be a
strong demand for such service.

-------------------
FROZENFISH CD-ROM's
-------------------

The first FrozenFish CD-ROM went into production on April 23rd and started
shipping on April 27th.  This CD contains 6128 archives, including the
complete archived contents of floppy disks 1-1000, all of the GNU and other
useful utilities off the latest FreshFish CD, and all of the new material on
the first three FreshFish CD's that was not included in the floppy library.

In summary, this CD currently contains everything of interest that I have ever
released on floppy or CD.

The FrozenFish CD is the CD that I'll be recommending for BBS/FTP use, because
it has a full 640+ Mb of archives, including much more than just what is in
the floppy library.  Although the GoldFish CD is a two CD set containing
approximately 1295 Mb of material, it is the same material (disks 1-1000)
presented in two different forms, archived (425 Mb) and unarchived (870 Mb).
So for BBS/FTP users, the FrozenFish CD is a superset of the GoldFish CD.

Anyone that has already preordered the GoldFish CD, that thinks the FrozenFish
CD would better suit their needs, can switch to the FrozenFish CD by simply
sending me a FAX or leaving me a message at (602) 917-0917.  You can also send
me electronic mail at my internet address "fnf@fishpond.cygnus.com".  If you
do request a switch, please advise me whether you would only want to switch if
you can get one of the CD's from the initial production run, rather than
having to wait for a possible second run.  There are only a limited number of
this CD currently available.

-----------------
GOLDFISH CD-ROM's
-----------------

The GoldFish CD-ROM is going into production on May 3rd and should start
shipping on about May 7th.  This is a two CD set, in a single slimline jewel
case, and contains the entire contents of the 1000 disk floppy library in both
archived (BBS ready) and unarchived form.

The first CD contains disks 1-1000 in archived form, and disks 1-249 in
unarchived form.  The second CD contains disks 250-1000 in unarchived form.
This 2 CD set is the same price as the single CD FrozenFish and FreshFish
CD's.

The GoldFish CD contains a program called "PufferFish", that makes it simple
to create master floppy disks directly off the CD-ROM, for further duplication
and distribution.  It also has the same BBS support files and tools as the
first FrozenFish CD, and contains a beta release of the new 2.0 version of
KingFisher to make finding material much easier.

------------------
FRESHFISH CD-ROM's
------------------

At this point I am completely sold out on the first (Oct 93) and second (Dec
93) FreshFish CD's.  The third FreshFish CD (Mar/Apr 94) started shipping on
Mar 14th and I still have sufficient stock of these CD's to meet the
anticipated demand for the next month or so.

The next FreshFish CD will be the May/June issue, and is expected to start
shipping about the middle of May.  My staging area for the new material that
will be included on this CD is already over 120Mb, and will likely grow to
close to 150Mb by the time the CD is finalized.

---------------------------
FUTURE FLOPPY DISK RELEASES
---------------------------

Now that I have reached disk 1000, I will no longer continue to produce a
floppy disk based distribution.  When I first announced this several months
ago, a number of organizations and individuals inquired about taking over this
job and continuing the library past disk 1000, with my "official blessing".  I
have selected Amazing Computing (PIM Publications) for this job, based on
their longtime commitment to the Amiga.

The conditions of continuing to keep my endorsement as the official
continuation of the floppy based library include adherence to my standards for
quality, production values (look and feel), and free redistribution of the
resulting work.  The plan is that they will select the best bits and pieces
off each FreshFish CD-ROM, and organize new floppy releases using this
material.  They may of course, decide to incorporate material from other
sources as well.

For a limited time I will continue to fill orders for floppy disks.  After
about June 1st, I will either forward floppy orders to Amazing Computing, or
return them to sender.

---------------------------
ISO-9660 MASTERING SOFTWARE
---------------------------

Starting with the March/April FreshFish CD-ROM, I switched mastering software.
I am now using an enhanced version of mkisofs, which was written by Eric
Youngdale, and enhanced by Frank Munkert to make it suitable for generating
the "Amiga flavor" of ISO-9660.  This mastering software has now been used to
produce the previous FreshFish CD, the FrozenFish CD, the GoldFish CD, and
will be used for the next FreshFish CD.

The CD-ROM's produced by mkisofs are 100% compatible with the latest versions
of most 3rd party CD-ROM filesystems, including AmiCDROM, Xetec, Ralph
Babel's, Commodore's 3.1, FastLane, and AsimWare Innovations.  Other products
have either not been tested or have been found to be incompatible for reasons
that are not yet clear.

This software is covered by the GPL (GNU General Public License) and once a
few more enhancements are made, myself or Frank will be working to get the
changes folded back into the version maintained by Eric.  In any case, the
package will be available for anyone to use.

Someone has already written a "bare-bones" graphical user interface for it.
Hopefully this will continue to evolve to the point where Amiga users will
have access to an easy to use mastering system for the production of Amiga
compatible CD-ROM's.

VERSION

         V2.0c

AUTHOR

         Boris Jakubaschk
         (Boris@alice.tynet.sub.org)

DESCRIPTION

         MTool provides all standard features of a directory utility:
         You can use it to copy, move and delete files, analyze a file
         type and perform an action on it (i.e. show pictures or ani-
         mations, play mods, edit texts...).

         MTool handles LHA-archives like ordinary directories. You can
         doubleclick the name of a LHA-archive and its contents will
         be displayed in the filelist. Files can be deleted or copied
         to and from the archive.

         The layout of MTool resembles the good old DiskMaster (V1.4).

         MTool has been developed using the look and feel of OS2.04
         and WB2.1. It works with WB2.0 (not localized, no screen mode
         requester); KS1.3 is not supported any more. It can be run on
         an own screen, a public screen or on the Workbench (resizable,
         position and size can be configured).

         Docs and/or catalogs are included in English, German, Swedish,
         French, Norwegian, Danish and Ialian.

NEW FEATURES

         V2.0:
         - Prefs editor (no ASCII-config any more!)
         - Notify on file lists
         - Appwindow support
         - Full keyboard control (including listviews)
         - Action on files inside of archives, i.e. you can display
           a text file by simply double clicking it in the archive
           list!

         V2.0c:
         - Some little bugfixes
         - Copy now works with parnet, XFH, CDFS...
         - File search utility with nice GUI.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

         MTool is shareware. It is freely distributable, as long as
         you distribute all files! Feel free to include it in public
         domain collections (i.e. fishdisks).

REQUIREMENTS

         Workbench 2.04 or higher

         To use the archive support of MTool, you need any version of
         the LHA archiver (not included)

         To view pictures or animations, to play mods etc you need
         programs that can be included in the configuration of MTool. 
         (i.e. VT, Player...)

         To install MTool with its installation script, you need the
         commodore installer (not included)

           string requester.
        4) PackIt will not crunch executables, unless told to do so.
           Note: PackIt will only crunch the executables as a data file
                 you will not be able to run them.
        5) PackIt will automaticly replace the source file unless a 
       destination is given.
        6) PackIt can take a dir as a destination, in that case it will 
       crunch/decrunch the file into that dir.
        7) Allows wildcard [de]crunching with dir recursion.
        8) Automatic adding and removing of .pp suffixes from data files.
        9) Info files will not be crunched unless you want them to.

DESCRIPTION

        Scheduler is a database, and appointment reminder utility 
    for the Amiga running OS2.04 and above. It allows you to keep
    track of all your friends, relatives, and business associates.
    It contains name, address, company name, 4 phone numbers, and
    a notes area. It works with most modems, so you can dial their
    home, work, or any number you wish. It supports CallerID so
    when someone is calling you it will search the database and
    show you who is calling! *The registered version contains a 
    call-logging feature that logs all calls coming in (with 
    CallerID) and out (dialing with Scheduler). It also lets you 
    setup several groups of entries, so you can categorize
    your database. Have your friends in a group named 'Friends' and
    family in 'Family'.
        The Calendar half of Scheduler makes it a very powerful reminder
    utility. It shows you a graphic look at your month's schedule by
    showing you how much of your month, even day is being spent! You
    can set alarms for any occasion.

DESCRIPTION

      Shelly is a small tool to generate 3D-objects of various 
      seashells (Ammonites, Slug-houses etc.) for:
      POV2.0, Real3DV2, TDDDlib (there are converters from TDDD to 
      Imagine,DXF,Rayshade,Vort,MFF,PS etc.pp), RAW.

      Source (compiles with no problems on SUN,HP,IBM(RS6000)) included!

NEW FEATURES

       new in V1.4:
      
       - fixed a bug in the NODULE calculation-mode (Shelly could end up
         in an infinite loop for some parameters)

       - fixed a bug that caused "Float-Exceptions" (when calculating
         shells without nodules) on DEC-Alpha-Architecture (and others?)
       
       - added "RENDER"-feature (Shelly calls POV itself to render a 
         preview)
       
       - added "Scale"-feature (the shell may be scaled now)
       
       - Shelly now supports 3 different nodule-types in one shell
           
       - Shelly now produces outputfiles with the right versionnumber ;)

As one net writer asked: "How many tee-shirts does it take to translate
Revivalist emotionalism into a sensible analysis, let alone a sensible
strategy?"

Despite the loyalty of owners, when million of dollars are needed to take
control, their voices only count as a sign of a living, maturing user base.
Global corporations will easily out-bid any small time get-together attempt.

The sale of Amiga seems to have been agreed - if a take-over is not already
fully underway. Just like you, I await an official statement!
