Claws of the Devil is the first Tomb Raider style game for the Amiga with it having 
horror-adventure parts which follows the adventures of Teri Fletcher.  Titan 
Computers are planning to release it sometime in the later half of 98.
<br>
<br>
Details are light but it'll have a real 3D engine with polygon bad guys and heroine, 
and realtime calculation of light sources to create realistic scenes.
<br>
<br>
You'll need a 040 processor, 8MB Ram, AGA, Hard Disk, CD-Rom drive, but they 
recommend you have a PPC board which will please all those who have one.
