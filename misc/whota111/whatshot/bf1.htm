Black Flag are behind the development of Caveman Species a real-time strategy 
wargame set in prehistoric time which was covered in a previous article.  This time, 
I'm able to bring you two new screenshots of Caveman Species that could be 
evolving into a really great game.

The developers have confirmed that development is continuing at a steady rate with 
Publishers showing keen interest, which I hope leads to it getting a Publisher.  The 
new graphics are outstanding just like the ones seen before with plenty of detail, 
congratulations to the graphican and lets hope it plays as good as it looks.
