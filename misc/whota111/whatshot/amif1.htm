Amiga Format

<P><A 
HREF="http://www.futurenet.com/mags/amigaformat/amigaformat.html">Amiga 
Format's</a> new CD (AFCD25) comes out on March 19th this year. It has
a much improved interface, we believe, but we would like to get feedback
from you, the readers from around the world.

<P>What we don't want to receive is a reasoned, cogent essay in a
didactorial style espousing the pros and cons of the CD. What we do want
is raw info, your thoughts as you use the CD for the first time and look
around it. We want to know where you always go on our CD, what types of
programs you look for, what your plusses and minuses are for the CD,
almost as though we were sitting in the same room as you and you were
talking about it. We believe that we are now making the best Amiga CD in
the world, but we want to hear what you think, in case there is any way
we can improve upon what we're doing right now.

<P>As an added incentive, we are offering ten copies of the following CD
issue (AF110) to the best report from a non-subscriber, so make sure you
put your mail address in your email.

<P>Send your reports to:

<P>Thanks,
