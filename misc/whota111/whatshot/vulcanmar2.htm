<B><FONT SIZE="6">E</FONT></B>arlier in the year Vulcan released a
statement to the Amiga community regarding their position in the market. One
thing that was mentioned in this statement was that the development of Wasted
Dreams had been put on hold while the market was reaccessed. Well, I can now
tell you that the developers have decided to continue with the game, this is
excellent news as this was a game that was eagerly awaited by many Amiga
owners.<P>

For those few people out there that do not know what Wasted Dreams is.  Well in
Vulcans words it is 'Mystery and suspence from a gigantic alien adventure in a
violent reality'.  Basically it is an action/adventure type game, however, it is
quite different to anything that has been seen on the Amiga before.<P>

The game is viewed from an isometric viewpoint, similar to that of Diablo on the
PC.  Over ten areas each containing many screens of action have to be fought
through.  The game offers a neat 2-player option where they can either
co-operate or fight with each other.<P>

Currently the development team, Digital FX, are just busy roto-scoping the last
few characters for the game.  They are also in the process of recording over
350Mb of digital actor speech to be implemented into the game.<P>

Currently Vulcan are hoping for a May '98 release.<P>
