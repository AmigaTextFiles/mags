<b><A HREF="http://www.vulcan.co.uk/">VULCAN SOFTWARE LIMITED</a> 
proudly presents a MARBLE EYE'S PRODUCTION of
GENETIC SPECIES The Amiga CD-Rom Spectacular</b>

<P><i>GENETIC SPECIES<br>
What The Amiga Was Made For!</i>

<P>Development on Genetic Species is in full steam and around the clock,
even though we have experienced some delays in it`s release date we are
confident that this awesome 3 year project will be ready towards the end
of April 98 with a full promotional release at the World of Amiga
(London) in May 98.

<P>Pre-orders are recommended and further details can be found at the
Vulcan website www.vulcan.co.uk with on-line ordering facilities and our
world wide stockists list.

<P>To fuel the excitement and build up of this title we have released the
following extensive information pack to clarify exactly what Genetic
Species Offers. Enjoy!


<P><b>FOREWORD</b>

<P>Genetic Species offers furiously invigorating and thrilling 3D action
with texture mapping speeds never before seen on any Amiga entertainment
title!

<P>With Atmosphere, Gameplay, Addictiveness and Presentation as its highest
priorities you will experience the ultimate escapism in a violent and
puzzling 3D world coupled with the most awesome environmental effects
and imagery which are all proudly displayed in 256 colours at an
incredible (1x1) Pixel Resolution using the most sophisticated Texture
Mapping Engine to date.

<P>In its simplest form Genetic Species requires an AGA Amiga with an 020
CPU, a minimum of 2mb Chip and 8Mb Fast Memory, a Hard Drive and a 2 x
Speed CDRom Drive. With more Fast Memory and a Faster CPU you will soon
discover that Genetic Species excels in visual presentation and by
choosing the appropriate window size, you will be spoiled by blindingly
fast action. Pushing the quality further, if you have a CyberGfx or
Picasso96 Graphics Card then you will soon realise what the Amiga was
made for! Graphics card users require only 0.5Mb of Chip Memory and a
minimum of 8mb Fast Memory.

<P>The first thing you will see is an awesome 200Mb 3D rendered intro
animation that sets the scene and atmosphere for the experience that
follows, in order to get the best out of the intro animation a 4 x Speed
CDRom is recommended.

<P>Once into the game you are bombarded with a Visual & Audio splendour
that is matched only by the speed, response time and gameplay. Genetic
Species has been written in 100% assembly and for the last 3 years has
seen many talented individuals eat, sweat and sleep nothing else to
bring you the ultimate 3D experience, so venture forth over the many
Huge Levels and frightening locations, all of which Demand a High
Element of Genetic Warfare and Logic Plot Based Puzzle Solving.

<P>Not only will you have a horrific weapon array (for mass murder) at your
disposal but you will also be equipped with the latest `In-Built
Portable Probe Device` were you will be able to `Psyche` Travel through
your Environment and even engage in `Body Transfers` to Assume the
Identity of other Entities. For navigation purposes your Portable On-
Screen `Alpha Map Display` with Size and Luminance Controls comes in
very handy.

<P>The Many Enemies encountered are superbly rendered and all have their
own unique `high level` artificial intelligence routines, each animated
in true to life multiple positions and each as deadly as the next.

<P>And finally, Genetic Species is brought to life with a massive selection
of High Quality Digital Sounds & Effects with Stereo Surround and an
incredible 30 Minutes of High Quality (in game) CD music.

<P><b>ENEMIES & CHARACTERS</b>

<P>Security Soldier<br>
An ordinary corporation security soldier wearing a light ergo suit which
is capable of resisting a few direct hits. Security soldiers prowl the
corridors of the base, gunning down intruders with their .44 pistols and
they never stop to ask questions first. Their implants are of a low
grade and they are vulnerable to probe attacks.

<P>Security Officer<br>
High rank Security Officers are tougher, quicker and meaner than
ordinary soldiers. They wear upgraded ergo suits and carry the .44
automatic gun. Their implants are simplistic to preserve human
intelligence and initiative.  Important rooms are often only accessible
to Security Officers.

<P>Cyber Scout<br>
The echelon of the automated defence forces. Hovering a few feet above
the ground they are a deadly foe in deserted corridors due to their
speed. The little human flesh and brain that remains is hidden within a
steel case.  Their implants are protected by extra circuitry, making it
difficult to take them over without killing them.

<P>Face Hugger<br>
This genetically engineered creature has no official name. We believe it
is a new prototype war-unit escaped from some laboratory, and apparently
capable of breeding without artificial support. Being the perfect base
invader it is extremely fast and its spitting of acid creates a very
dangerous entity. They have no implants but their genetic control
mechanisms are very vulnerable to entity take-overs.

<P>Engineer<br>
Otherwise know as the `Dirt Rats`, The Engineers keep the bases running,
they wear no armour and their implants are primitive, but simply
spotting an intruder is enough to bring them to a blood frenzy. If you
get too close, he will try to chop you to pieces with his fire axe, show
him mercy and kill him. Engineers are also needed to access some
systems.

<P>Commander<br>
The commanding officer of the base is the toughest and most dangerous
human you will come across. He throws lethal grenades at intruders. Some
restricted areas are only accessible by the commander or someone
carrying a commander access card.

<P>Zombie<br>
Zombies are the victims of evil Genetic experiments. Dragging their
rotting limbs along, they are slow but also hard to kill. Silenced guns
are not very powerful but zombies will happily keep shooting at you
forever. Their implants have difficulty controlling the damaged brains
and taking them over is often the
easiest way to give them eternal peace.

<P>Gel Man<br>
Little know information on this abdominal creature but the Gel Man is
another genetic creation designed for environments with extreme
pressures.

<P>Mantis<br>
Little is know about these creatures. They seem to boast some kind of
Psi-weapon.

<P>Mechanoid<br>
Strong defensive units carrying lethal flechette guns. 90% of their
bodies have been mechanised and armoured to take a phenomenal amount of
damage. Their implants are strong, and a PPD attack without stunning
will leave them severely damaged. Notice that they are limited to
warfare and cannot handle delicate objects such as keycards or small
weapons.

<P>Scientist<br>
The science personnel of the laboratories. They wear no armour and carry
weak weapons. Their implants are not designed to repulse a probe attack
so they can easily be taken over. Some areas are only accessible to
scientists.

<P>StormTrooper<br>
Aggressive commando troopers, specially trained to locate and kill
intruders. The standard weapon is the laser rifle which they will
happily use to snipe on you. Their armour is light to allow maximum
mobility and their implants are medium grade.

<P>Chameleon Soldier<br>
The skin of the chameleon man has been altered to camouflage the body.
This works best when he is standing still, only when shooting and
getting hit will the camouflage field disrupt to show the puny human
inside. The high speed assault rifle carried by chameleon soldiers is
too dangerous to ignore, so don't. The implants will yield to persistent
attacks.

<P>Wolfhead<br>
This biped killing machine is one of the most dangerous units around.
Mounted on the left arm is a rocket launcher. You guessed it, Rocket
launchers are bad for your health. Some units come with a Vulcan minigun
instead. The controlling implants of this unit will only disable if
stunned.

<P>Space Pilot<br>
When not piloting space ships, the pilots are in an understandably bad
mood. The Space Pilot carries a grenade launcher which fires stun
grenades capable of putting even the biggest brute to sleep. The clumsy
space suit
puts some restraint on his mobility, but protects against vacuum and
probe attacks.

<P>Battle Cyborg<br>
Battle Cyborgs are enhanced, heavily armoured humans capable of high
speed. They carry flame throwers for toasting enemies. Due to the
exposed upper body, the implants are weak compared to the durability of
the body.

<P><b>G E N E T I C  S P E C I E S
Amiga CDRom</b>

<P><b>ENTIRE GAME FEATURES IN DETAIL</b>

<P><b>INSTALLING TO HARD DRIVE</b>

<P>Genetic Species runs perfectly from the CD and does not require Hard
Drive installation, but you will need to install various library files
from the 'Install' directory depending on your individual computer set-
up.


<P><b>GRAPHICS CARD OWNERS</b>

<P>If you have a Graphics Card you should install the RTG system. This will
place various files in your libs directory on your hard drive and when
initiating Genetic Species allow you to choose various screen modes from
the RTG requester.

<P><b>AHI SOUND SUPPORT</b>

<P>Genetic Species utilises the AHI sound system allowing multiple channel
and  stereo sound effects (even without a Sound Card) this should be
installed before starting Genetic Species.

<P><b>PICASSO 96 OWNERS</b>

<P>If you have a Picasso Graphics Board there is a full installation
program which will place the needed libraries onto your hard drive.
Having a Picasso board you will more than likely have the needed files
so check that
this is not an older version than your current one.

<P><b>CD MUSIC</b>

<P>Genetic Species contains superb CD Music which is played throughout the
game, to get the best out of this Audio treat make sure your CDRom line
outs are connected to a good stereo system and that the volume is high!
Genetic Species also uses the Amigas Audio outputs for all in-game sound
effects.

<P><b>FIRST IMPRESSIONS</b>

<P>When you have successfully installed the various library files you will
then be able to run Genetic Species by double clicking on it's icon on
the CD.

<P>First up is the Credit sequence, this is our chance to let you know who
all  the 'hard working people' are, who spent many sleepless nights to
bring you Genetic Species. To skip the credit sequence simply press your
LMB.

<P>Now sit back and marvel at the incredible 3D rendered intro animation,
this sets the mood for what is about to follow and gives you an insight
into the current situation in the Genetic Species world. You can
terminate the intro animation by clicking any mouse button.
Please note that the intro Animation does not utilise Graphics Cards.

<P><b>CONFIGURATION</b>

<P>After the intro sequences the first thing you will see is the options
screen. Using the arrow keys and the return key on the keyboard you can
configure Genetic Species to best suit your Amiga's set-up.

<P>You have many options available that alter the way Genetic Species
works.
You can alter many elements from, screen size, sound set-up, detail
level and control methods. Depending on your Amiga set-up you will soon
find the right balance to make sure Genetic Species performs at the best
possible speed and clarity for your system.

<P>If the frame rate is an important factor when choosing your settings,
you can type `framecount` as a level code which will show the frame
counter on the screen during play.

<P>Once happy with your preference setting you can save them to hard disk
so the next time you play Genetic Species it will already be set-up to
your desired configuration.

<P>When finished in the options Screen simply choose 'Disconnect' to start
playing Genetic Species.


<P><b>CONFIGURATION SETTINGS IN DETAIL</b>

<P>Window Size<br>
Controls the size of the visible playing area, this setting has the
greatest influence on game speed.

<P>Floor & Ceiling Detail Mapping<br>
The floor and ceiling detail level can be set to high, low or turned off
completely, the low detail setting produces a 10-20% increase in speed
over the high setting.

<P>Luminance Factor<br>
Is everything too bright in the darkness of your tomb or are those sun
reflexes blotting out everything on the monitor? Boost or reduce
brightness here.

<P>Audio On/Off<br>
If you wish to change AHI mode, you must turn off Audio, exit the menu,
enter the Audio menu again, and turn on Audio. An AHI requester will pop
up, allowing you to choose a new mode or different mixing frequencies.
Note: Turning off Audio can also speed up the game by 8-20%.

<P>Channels<br>
Depending on the AHI mode used, up to 16 channels of sound effects are
allowed.  We recommend using the AHI mode "Paula: DMA 8 bit stereo" for
best performance on Amigas lacking sound card, however you will be
limited to 4 channels.

<P>Volume<br>
Boost the volume to balance Amiga Audio and CD music. Please note that
extreme boosting may cause sound distortion.

<P>Player Control<br>
Here you may select your favourite key settings for controlling the
BioShifter.

<P>Mouse Control<br>
Enable/Disable Mouse - Doesn't need explanation, does it?

<P>Sensitivity Factor<br>
Some mice are more sensitive than others, use this setting to control
how fast the BioShifter turns when moving your mouse.

<P>Control Method<br>
Moving the mouse to the left will turn the BioShifter clockwise. If this
doesn't seem logical to you, change this setting to invert the
direction.

<P>Multitasking On/Off<br>
If you need to keep you operating system and programs running keep the
switch on. Turning off multitasking will freeze all programs increasing
the game speed by 3-4%. Turning it on will restore your system.

<P>Buffering<br>
Really mega-advanced setting for those GFX card users whose GFX card
works best with single buffering.
On AGA systems you should always use double buffering!

<P>GfxMode<br>
A feature for GFX card owners; with this switch you may force Genetic
Species to bypass RTG, utilising AGA.
It has no effect on AGA only systems.

<P>Language Options<br>
Choose your favourite language here, thanks to the A.T.O.

<P>CD Music On/Off<br>
If your CD-ROM drive misbehaves, try turning off the CD music.

<P>Ammo Display On/Off<br>
Are those awesome transparent ammo counters and health bars annoying
you? Turn them off here.

<P>Difficulty Normal/Easy<br>
This setting controls the damage factor of the game. Chicken players
will choose the easy setting and real hard nut people should choose
Normal.


<P><b>BACKGROUND HISTORY</b>

<P>Since the beginning of the 21st century, Multi and Trans-National
corporations had been gaining power.

<P>By the end of the century, global security, commerce and science were in
the hands of a few hundred people. Industrial complexes and research
stations had been established in space and on the moon, where research
would never be impeded by environmental or ethical concerns.

<P>Due to rife competition and security of research, all employees of the
corporations were implanted with artificial control mechanisms to ensure
complete loyalty. Competing freely, conflicts among the corporations
frequently sparked local wars, fought anywhere in the Solar system,
including Earth. As a result the rest of the human race was held
hostage.

<P>As the 22nd century began, an underground alliance had been established
among countries which were secretly seeking to undermine corporate
power. This alliance was known as the Counter Force Alliance (C.F.A.)
yet their strength was inadequate in the face of corporate power, and
nothing could be accomplished until something tipped the balance of
power. This happened in 2208.

<P><b>PRESENT DAY
(C.F.A. Internal Memo)
</b>
<P>Apparently the Nepentian Research Labs on the far side of the Magnus
Crater was seized by an unknown force. Observations suggested intense
ground battles within the vicinity of the base, involving at least three
corporations. Two days ago the battles seemed to diminish, yet we have
been unable to identify which corporation came out victorious, if any.
Throughout the day we have tracked military shuttles shipping troops and
cargo from the remaining lunar facility, the Cantex Supply Station.
Sources have informed us that the destination was the Atlas Mining
Asteroid orbiting the moon.

<P><b>Atlas Mining Asteroid</b>

<P>The Atlas Mining Asteroid is currently being converted into a regular
space fortress armed with high energy space weapons. Whatever purpose
this conversion serves is unknown but we suspect it might become a
threat to Earth. The recent alliance between the remaining military
corporations, the Nepentian Defence Triad and Lantaz Milsec, (to whom
the destroyed lunar bases belonged) suggests knowledge of an impending
disaster.

<P>Yesterday, 2 out of 3 lunar military bases were vaporised in what looked
like accidents involving stockpiled nuclear weapons but we suspect they
were self-destruct actions aimed at an unknown enemy aggressor.

<P>We desperately need information on the current situation!

<P><b>Begin C.F.A. Transmission</b>

<P>For some years, within the many corporation complexes, we have been
planting prototypes of the 'BioShifter'. This mobile device is capable
of taking control of Humans, Cyborgs and Droids through their electronic
implants.

<P>We have just activated of one of the BioShifters within the Cantex
Supply Station, where the bulk of the troops and supplies are being
launched into space.

<P>Lets hope we get the information we need.

<P>End Transmission


<P><b>BIOSHIFTER INITIALISATION</b>

<P>You are the first BioShifter to be activated in the Cantex Supply
Station.

<P>Once your mounted cameras are activated the distorted image clarifies to
present your environment as a 3D 'first person' perspective view.


<P><b>MISSION OBJECTIVES</b>

<P>The plot progression of Genetic Species is Bilinear, this means that you
will have to accomplish various missions before you can progress to
later levels, the way you go about accomplishing your missions is
entirely up to you. Pay close attention to your mission briefings and be
alert at all times and take nothing for granted.


<P><b>YOUR SURROUNDINGS</b>

<P>The 3D environment is presented in glorious texture mapped and light
sourced style instantly allowing you to get a real feel for your
surroundings.

<P>The levels in Genetic Species are broken down into further platforms and
each platform is connected by lift terminals which you can access
freely. This design is very useful for leaving entire sections quickly
in the case of level destruction or in situations where enemy numbers
are outrageously out of balance.

<P><b>FURNITURE & PROPS</b>

<P>Throughout the levels you will come across many interactive Furnishings
such as Doors and Cupboards which can be opened and closed, although
some need to be unlocked first by means of 'switches or key cards'.

<P>Computer Terminals can be found at various stages in the levels which
allows control over the In-Game configurations.

<P>There are also hidden BioShifters which are only visible to you and have
been planted by the C.F.A. Activate them (by walking over them) and they
will record your current position. This is really useful if you find
yourself `dead` as you will now be allowed to restart from the last
recorded position.

<P>As well as secret passages and many other architectural oddities there
will be various items and objects ranging from exploding barrels, to
energy vortex's, some should be left well alone where others like the
Vortex's can be entered to allow re-topping of energy levels. Most other
items can either be operated, picked up or destroyed but act wisely as
many items can help your missions immensely.

<P><b>CHARACTERS</b>

<P>There are many interesting and frightening enemies within Genetic
Species ranging from Engineers to Face huggers, each enemy is unique and
has his or her own abilities, weaknesses and weapons, each posing a
different threat.

<P><b>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</b>

<P>The characters in Genetic Species are highly intelligent, for example if
you creep around quietly you can sometimes go unnoticed, but when
creating a disturbance either by firing a `non silenced weapon` or
setting off an explosion, then nearby characters (depending on their
hearing levels) are bound to investigate.

<P>Many hours have been spent to develop the AI structures which define the
personality and behaviour of the creatures in different situations so
the following text is for the most intriguing and inquisitive players.

<P><b>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  IN DEPTH</b>

<P>When initialising a level all enemies are set to `Prowl` mode as
default. In this mode the enemies wander around the level area freely,
searching for intruders. If the player makes any kind of noise, like
firing a
weapon within hearing range, the enemy will notice and while calculating
the easiest route to the origin of the noise, move closer to
investigate.

<P>Generally, doors are not a problem to enemies, as long as they can be
opened and/or unlocked by the current enemy type.

<P>When the player appears in the enemy's line of view, the enemy will
decide what to do considering levels of aggression, health, damage
taken, amount of friends and the distance to the player. Unless the
enemy is mortally
wounded or just a plain coward, he will go into Attack mode where his
only purpose is to get within range of the intruder and kill him. Even
if the player escapes out of sight and doesn't make any noise, the enemy
will continue to follow in the same direction as the player until he
reaches a dead end.

<P>Occasionally the enemy might decide to retreat, panicking and running
away in a random direction from the last known player position. Only
when running into a dead end will he stop to calm down, returning to
prowl mode.

<P>It might be a good idea to terminate fleeing enemies as they tend to
gossip about your location to other enemy comrades.

<P><b>BIOSHIFTER SHIFTER CONTROL</b>

<P>Being a mobile BioShifter, you have the ability to travel in any
direction, Forwards, Backwards, Sideways and Rotating, you can also
walk, run, look behind you, operate equipment and terminals, open doors,
pickup objects and fire weapons.

<P><b>PORTABLE PROBE DEVICE (P.P.D.)</b>

<P>The BioShifter has an in-built Portable Probe Device (P.P.D.) which can
be used for two distinct purposes.

<P>The first function is to enable you to see what the future holds. The
minute you have launched the probe you will then see 'what it sees'
through the use of an in-built micro camera (The Third Eye).  You can
steer the P.P.D. as it journeys forwards by using the arrow keys to
guide it around corners and down corridors (this is very useful if you
are running low on stamina and want to know what is up ahead). The probe
will only last for around 5 seconds before transmission is terminated or
will cease to function prematurely if it hits a wall or door. Please
note that while you are controlling the P.P.D. your un-defended host
body is vulnerable to enemy attacks.

<P><b>P.P.D. USED FOR ENTITY TAKE OVER</b>

<P>The second function of the P.P.D. is the most important and an integral
element for success in your missions.

<P>If you have previously Stunned a character (See Stunning) then you can
guide the probe straight into that stunned 'Character'. If successful
then your Bio programs will initiate a Cerebral Cortex intrusion through
the Entities Identification implant and your life force will absorb into
that 'Character' allowing you to 'control' and to become that
'Character' for the duration of your life.

<P>The sequence is fast and violent but once successful you should be able
to catch a glimpse of your former hosts body falling to the floor as
your perspective changes.

<P>Taking over other characters is vital to some missions, for example you
might have to become an Engineer to operate a particular piece of
machinery or perhaps a Scientist to gain access to secured Scientific
labs or even
a Face Hugger to allow fast 'close to floor' escape from a scary
situation.

<P><b>PICKING UP OBJECTS & WEAPONS</b>

<P>You have the ability to hold up to 3 items (objects or weapons) which
can be accessed during play by pressing the appropriate function keys
F1, F2 or F3.

<P>Your default weapon always resides in the F1 position.

<P>Whenever you run over an item (that can be picked up) it will
automatically fill one of your empty slots, if all slots are filled and
you wish to exchange one of your current items for a newly found item,
then simply stand over the newly found item and press either F2 or F3 to
make the exchange.

<P>You can also get information on your active object or weapon by pressing
and holding down the help key on the keyboard.


<P><b>WEAPONS</b>

<P>The weapon arsenal in Genetic Species is one of the most brutal any
Amiga game has ever seen, ranging from Electric drills, Grenade
launchers to Rocket Launchers, you will never be helpless when faced
against incredible odds. When you take over certain characters you
automatically have access to their weapon but many weapons are also
littered around the locations.

<P>Bare in mind that the ability to use certain weapons is only allowed by
certain characters so be careful to choose wisely when taking over
another entity.

<P><b>AMMUNITION</b>

<P>The blood of a Weapon! You'll soon learn that no matter how good a
weapon is, it is useless without ammunition. Ammunition can be collected
throughout the levels but conserve your need for wasting it as there's
nothing worse than being caught in a corridor with 6 fully armed Droids
approaching with only one bullet left! Best use it on yourself! :)

<P>Some weapons (like the Fire Axe) have unlimited Ammunition.

<P><b>STUNNING CHARACTERS</b>

<P>There are special Stun weapons available, these give off sharp
concentrated electric energy bursts or stun smoke and when used properly
will stun almost all living entities.

<P>Sometimes the stunned Entities appearance turns a frosty blue colour as
their cells temporarily solidify but in all successful stuns the
character remains motionless, although the stunned state is only
temporary it should give you enough time to launch the P.P.D. for take-
over or at least run away.

<P>Some smaller weapons can also stun characters but are not so reliable.

<P><b>PORTABLE MAP</b>

<P>To help you keep track of your virtual location you are also equipped
with a portable map device, this can be activated or deactivated by a
press of a button and also scaled to fill all your display or part of
your display.

<P>There is also the ability to set the luminance controls so it can be
dimmed into your view to allow continuous play whilst map reading.
However the maps should only be used as a rough guide to your location
as the data may be somewhat outdated and not reveal all secret
locations.

<P><b>HINTS AND TIPS</b>

<P>You never know what can happen in Genetic Species, some puzzles are
devious and not everything should be destroyed or blown away, look out
for secret passage ways and rooms and always make sure you are the
correct character for the task ahead. Good Luck!
