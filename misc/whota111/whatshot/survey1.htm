<p>
There are two questionaires to be found here, which ask you what you think the 
next generation Amiga and what Amiga OS 4.0 and Workbench 4.0 should be like, 
because of all the big announcements which were made in January.  The results of 
these two questionaires will be sent onto those companies who are making Amiga 
compatible machines and to Amiga Inc.
<p>
Every effort has been made to make sure that both questionaires can be used by all 
the web browsers currently in use out there, but it is advised that if you're using an 
Amiga web browser, that you use either AWeb or IBrowse, as Voyager seems to 
have a problem with the mailto: html code.
<p>
So, click on each of the following links to take yourself to each of the questionaires in turn.
