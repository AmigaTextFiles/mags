"We are glad to see that with <I>phase 5 digital products</I> another important

the AMIGA OS 3.1", says Petro Tyschtschenko of AMIGA International, Inc. "As 
<I>phase 5</I>

has led the development of PowerPC products for the AMIGA, this is an

important agreement which will give a  momentum to the future development of

AMIGA and AMIGA-compatible systems, an expectation which is also supported by

the cooperation of the different licensees of our AMIGA technology", he

significant efforts into this new project, and we appreciate the support of
