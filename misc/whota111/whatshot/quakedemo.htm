<B><FONT SIZE="6">A</FONT>t</B> last, people can finally find out how 
good Amiga Quake really is. A rolling demo was placed on the ClickBOOM web site 
on Friday for the Amiga public to download at will.<P>

Unfortunately, you are not able to actually play the game, however, you do get a
very good insight how well the game will run on your Amiga.  The game uses the
actual code (It's not just a video) that will be used by the game itself, so its
a case of the full game will run at the same speed as this.<P>
The demo is available direct from the ClickBOOM webpage at:-<P>
