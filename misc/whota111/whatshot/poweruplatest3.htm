<P><B>The future of the A\BOX project</B></P>

<P>In parallel to the announcement of the <B>pre\box computer,</B> an 
upcoming
Amiga OS 3.1 compatible and PowerPC-based computer system, phase 5 digital
products also releases an updated project status on the <B>A\BOX 
development.</B>
The most important message is, that although the <B>A\BOX project</B> is
postponed and will have to be significantly updated and revised, it is not
cancelled. <I>&quot;First of all, we would like to thank all enthusiasts
who have supported us with their positive input and their trust in the past
year&quot; </I>says Wolf Dietrich, General Manager of phase 5 digital products.
<I>&quot;Unfortunately, we can not honour this support with the announcement
that our A\BOX system is close to shipping. During the last year, we had
to spend considerably more resources into the PowerUP development than we
had initially planned, and the delay in the PowerUP developments as well
as the restrained development of the Amiga market in general did not allow
us to follow our development roadmaps for 1997.&quot; </I>While the company
until late last year had planned to reassign most development resources
to the <B>A\BOX project</B> after the finalization of the last PowerUP boards
and their add-ons, it has now been decided to realize the <B>pre\box computer
system first</B>. This move has been made in order to provide a stand-alone
product which can expand the market and the gross sales volume, thus providing
an economic base for the further developments in the <B>A\BOX project,</B>
as well as providing a base for a growing software development and a growing
user base.</P>

<P><I>&quot;We believe that there remains a strong niche for the computer
system which integrates the concepts that we have outlined in the A\BOX
project&quot;</I> states Dietrich. <I>&quot;It is a project which is driven
by a vision that will not be outdated. The A\BOX will remain our long-term
technology project, and the major contribution to the technological goals
of our company. As we need to assign more resources into this development,
and know that we need more time too, we will be making the A\BOX a project
which is targeting the year 2000 - and we want to make it worth the expectations
that many people will set in a computer which arrives at the beginning of
a new millenium.&quot;</I> Meanhwile, t<B>he pre\box project</B> will 
realize
a system which is more than a just stepping stone towards the 
<B>A\BOX.</B></P>

<P>Dietrich points out that the developments of the PowerUP products as
well as the new pre\box computer system incorporate step by step technologies
which will be used in the <B>A\BOX</B>. <I>&quot;Today it is clear that
the A\BOX will be realized as a multi-processing system right from the beginning,
a technology which will be introduced with the pre\box already. This will
help to build substantial experience and know-how in MP software design
on the side of the software developers, and provide a strong software base
for the A\BOX when it is released.&quot;</I> When the <B>A\BOX</B> comes
to the market, new generations of PowerPCs with integrated VMX multimedia
engines will be the entry-level standard for the <B>A\BOX</B>; these 
developments
must also be considered in the design of the CAIPIRINHA custom chip which
will be ready to utilize the functionality and performance of these next-generation
processors. Later revisions of the<B> pre\box</B> systems will already 
incorporate
such CPUs, thus providing solid experience in the implemetation of the related
technologies, as well as experience in other technical areas, for the desing
of the <B>A\BOX system.</B></P>

<P>phase 5 digital products will continue to evaluate the latest technologies
- not only those already on the market, but also those to come - which will
be considered for the <B>A\BOX development.</B> For the design specifications
of the CAIPIRINHA custom chip this will mean that most advanced technologies,
which are available when the CAIPIRINHA goes to silicon, will be incorporated
into the chip design. <I>&quot;While we were talking about 0.35 micron 
technologies
and 200 MHz core frequency a year ago, a 0.25 micron technology and core
frequencies of 300 MHz or more are targets of today; however, we will stay
updated with the development and availability of newer and faster ASIC 
technology&quot;</I>
comments Wolf Dietrich. Some other developments and technologies which are
under consideration and evaluation for the revised A\BOX design specifications
include (but are not limited to):</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Wider date busses for the processors and possibly also the main memory
  <LI>Higher clock speed on the data busses towards the memory and the 
processors
  <LI>Usage of new memory technologies such as DDR-SDRAM, ESDRAM, 
SLDRAM
  or alternatively RAMBUS and other technologies
  <LI>Licensing of next-generation DSP and/or 3D cores for complementary
  integration into the custom design
</UL>

<P>In a process of continuous and extensive evaluation of the most advanced
technologies and design options it shall be guaranteed in the future that
within the <B>A\BOX project</B> a computer system will be realized, which
will provide stunning conceptual and technological innovation even under
the aspect of the fast progressing technologies of the computer industry.</P>

<P>With the announcement of the <B>pre\box
computer system project </B>, phase 5 digital products has also specified
some plans on the further enhancements and development of the PowerUP System
Software, which will be the major software component for the complementary
usage of AMIGA OS 3.1 on the<B> pre\box systems.</B> These upcoming 
features
further consolidate the position of phase 5 digital products as the <B>leader
in PowerPC technology and innovation</B> for the Amiga computer system.</P>

<P>Currently available for download is a new version of the PowerUP System
Software, which provides enhanced performance and improved multitasking
behaviour, as well as several other improvements. This new software release
version can be downloaded from the <B>PPC-directory in phase 5's ftp-
site.</B></P>

<P>The PowerUP System Software and it's multi-processing features will be
undergoing constant improvement and optimization, with a strong focus on
the multiprocessing functionality which will be transparently utilized on
the <B>pre\box systems.</B> It is taken care that developers who make use
of the advanced mechanisms of the PowerUP System Software, such as the flexible
multithreading and multiprocessing capable message system, and follow the
guidelines for development which are recommended by phase 5 digital products,
will have MP-ready applications right away when the <B>pre\box systems</B>
will be released to the public later this year.</P>

<P>As an extension to the low-level functionality of the PowerUp System
Software, phase 5 will also introduce new <B>functionality on the system-service
level. </B>Currently, the development of special <B>server tasks</B> has
been initiated, which represent a <B>scalable and multiprocessing-capable
successor </B>of the shared-library concept of AMIGA OS. These server tasks
- which do not replace, but complement the shared libraries - can be installed
in the system, and provide a fully asynchronous functionality; programs
which want to use the services of a server task identify it's message port,
and send a message to the server task which will execute the requested operations
and reply the message of the calling program. With this concept, it is possible
to provide fully hardware-independent functionality for the application
programs. A 3D application, for example, can simply send a request for drawing
a scene to an OpenGL server task, which then executes all necessary operations
and distributes them to different CPUs or other hardware which may be available
in the system.</P>

<P>phase 5 digital products currently works on a <B>Server Task version</B>
of the powerful and fast <B>CyberGL library</B>, which provides a compatible
subset of the OpenGL functionality, combined with high performance and full
PowerPC support (the currently released version of this library is available
in form of link libraries for 68k and PowerPC, together with examples and
developer documentation, from the <B>CyberGL-directory in phase 5's ftp-site.
</B>Another project that has been initiated is the design of a Display Postscript
Server Task, which will provide an important support for all software developers
who need fast and high quality Postscript visualization. More server tasks
will be added in the future, in order to provide hardware-independent and
PowerPC-based system services. All these Server Tasks will be fully scalable,
and can - of course fully transparent for the application which uses the
functionality of the server tasks - work on one-Chip-603e-based entry level
machines, as well as on the multi-processor based pre\box systems or even
networked clusters of such machines with virtually unlimited numbers of
CPUs.</P>

<P>These new developements of phase 5 digital products will provide a 
significant
innovation in software design. Consequently, phase 5 will propose these
concepts towards Amiga Inc. as well as the ICOA to be adopted as common
standards; with this move phase 5 digital products wants to further support
the Amiga community and developers.
