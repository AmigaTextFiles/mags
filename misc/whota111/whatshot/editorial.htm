Hi,
<p>
This issue is as packed with news as the last issue, but this issue's news is 
dominated yet again by Phase 5, who are mentioned in no less 
than 4 articles of which 2 of them are exclusives, these are <A 
HREF="aimar1.htm">Amiga International, Inc.: Phase 5 
Licensee</A>, <A HREF="phase51.htm">Phase 5 Digital Products Announces 
Development of the Pre\Box, a PowerPC-Based Computer System with Amiga OS 
3.1</A>, <A HREF="poweruplatest2.htm">PowerUp Latest</A> and <A 
HREF="poweruplatest3.htm">A\Box and PowerUp Project Latest</A> articles.  
The Pre\Box which will be coming from Phase 5 by the end of this year, is I think a 
step in the right direction when it comes to next generation Amiga, which will no 
doubt go down with current Amiga owners, but how are they going to sale it to 
the rest of the world and are we going to see a PowerPC port of Amiga OS 3.1 for 
the Pre\Box?  Hopefully, I will inform you more about the Pre\Box as soon as I as 
get some more information on it.  But even with this domainance of Phase 5 in this 
issue's news, there is still plenty of other news of there with the announcement that 
Photogenics Ng and ImageFX 3.0 will be making their debuts at the Gateway 
Amiga show Amiga98 along with a lot of other news on the upcoming Amiga 98 
show and also that Siamese Systems are now accepting pre-orders for it's PC-based 
Amiga board which hasn't got the attention that it deserves due to Phase 5's 
flooding of this issue's news with their announcements.
<p>
Another article which will no doubt be of interest is the <A 
HREF="aimar2.htm">Amiga Flame Interview With Petro Tyschtschenko</A> 
article in which Petro Tyschtschenko gives a reply to the comments made by Vulcan 
Software about the state of the Amiga which was included in whota110.lha and he 
also goes on about the direction that Amiga International and Amiga Inc will be 
taking the Amiga in the not too distant future.
<p>
The <A HREF="survey1.htm">survey</A>, which in fact is two surveys is 
present in this issue and is ready for you to fill in.  These surveys will be present 
in the next couple of issues of whota and will also be available at the web site.  
The response so far hasn't been all that good, so please fill them in and have your 
say in the future direction of the Amiga.  Even though Phase 5 has announced that 
they'll bringing out an Amiga compatible computer by the end of the year, which 
will be more than a match for current high spec PCs, I think that Phase 5 and other 
Amiga clone manufacturers need to know what the Amiga community want their 
next generation Amiga to be like.
<p>
Check out this issue's <A HREF="nib.htm"> News In Brief</A>, which in this 
issue is dominated mainly by little bits and pieces of games news along with the 
latest on the Amiga RC5 Team Effort.

who have no less than 3 articles in this issue's news.  These are the<A

Team, Famous for Uropa2</A>, <A HREF="vulcanmar2.htm">Wasted Dreams 
Development Re-started</A> and <A HREF="vulcanmar3.htm">Vulcan Software
