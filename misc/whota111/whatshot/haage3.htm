service (ideal for small businesses. Allows your customers to contact
you at any time and use fax on demand to remotely download facsimile
information about your products!) and create advanced voice control
scripts. You could even set up your own voice answering service as you
find when phoning large companies such as British Airways: press 1 on
your telephone to be put through to an operator, press 2 to.... etc.
Why not create your own mini-BBS? Point and click BBS setup allows you
