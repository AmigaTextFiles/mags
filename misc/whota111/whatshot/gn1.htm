Great Nations is a strategy game in the style of Civilisation which is under 
development for both the PC and Amiga platforms.  It's a multiplayer game so you 
can play other human players on the same computer or playing across a network, 
something many Amiga owners have always wanted in Civilisation is now being 
done for Great Nations.

It will require AGA or a graphics card, 020 processor or higher, with at least 6MB 
of Fast Ram.  A GFX card is highly recommended.
