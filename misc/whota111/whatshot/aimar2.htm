<CENTER><H2>Amiga Flame Interview With Petro Tyschtschenko
</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The following article is from Amiga Flame's web site.
<p>

Over the last few weeks we have seen many companies and individuals questioning 
what Amiga International and Amiga Inc are doing or in fact not doing.  Paul 
Carrington of Vulcan Software, the biggest Amiga games publisher has publicly 
critised them for not acting like the mother company of the Amiga and taking the 
responsibility of making the next generation of Amiga's.  I have also been 
frustrated and so asked Petro Tyschtschenko, Managing Director of Amiga 
International some tough questions to find out what is going on and look for 
reassurance on some concerning matters.

1.  How did Amiga Inc and Amiga International come to the decision that no new 
Amiga models would come from them?
<br>
<br>
You can't beat a deal like that. Only 10% to sell your
Amiga items and only if they are sold.
<br>
I would say the question you have raised is not 100 % in line with our
statement.
<br>
<br>
Amiga Inc. will upgrade the OS 3.1 and AMIGA International, Inc will produce
and distribute these products. Amiga Inc. will develop new products and we
will license this developments to potential companies. If the companies are
willing to produce under their own brand name, AMIGA International, Inc. is
able to distribute the machines also under the Amiga brand name. 
As you may know, our current A1200s were produced by a 3rd party and not by
AMIGA International, Inc.
<br>
<br>
2.  Many games publishers where staying with the Amiga under the assumption 
that a new Amiga model would come from Amiga Inc and Amiga International and 
the consequences of this announcement as been the news that one of the biggest 
Amiga games publishers has entered into the PC and Playstation markets.  Surely 
this decision has been a bad one for the Amiga market?
<br>
I'm 100 % sure that as soon as new developments from Amiga Inc. are
available software companies will apply to participate on the success of these new 
developments.

<br>
<br>
3.  Vulcan Software, the biggest Amiga games publisher who have recently entered 
into the PC and Playstation market after being instrumental in creating the CD-Rom 
revolution have critised Amiga International and Amiga Inc for not acting like the 
mother company of the Amiga and taking the responsibility of creating the new 
Amiga for the future.  What is your reaction to Vulcan Software's statement?
<br>
I'm very unhappy about the statement of Vulcan Software. 
I think that patience will be rewarded in future. I fully understand the
reaction of Vulcan Software, because they have to survive. And other markets
are more profitable at this time than our current Amiga market. But I have
also connections with other software houses in the U.K. which have developed
software before in the glorious times of Amiga. They are watching us and if
they smell a business, I'm convinced they will be back again.

<br>
<br>
4.  Some people within the Amiga Community have been suggesting that the 
money allocated for Amiga Inc and Amiga International from Gateway 2000 was 
less than expected and this has caused the decision that no new Amiga models will 
be made by you?  Is the support from Gateway 2000 still strong?
<br>
There are many rumours going around in our Amiga community, because of  the
lack of information. My understanding and my experience with Gateway 2000,
Inc. is that Gateway will support Amiga were ever it is necessary and were
ever it makes sense. Gateway has already spent a lot of money with the
purchase of Amiga. And they are not hesitating to invest more, if they are
convinced that presented and explained business plans are realistic and it is
to expect a return on investment. And I have no doubts that we can be a very
profitable company with a new Amiga production range in future.
<br>
<br>
5.  In the announcement by Amiga Inc, it said that "New machines will come from 
companies who have a license from Amiga International" but it is obvious to many 
that even though these companies are good engineers to design a new Amiga they 
do not have the money or capabilities to get new Amiga's into the shops or have 
any effective Advertising.  Do you intend to help these companies by providing the 
money for distribution of their Amiga's to the high street shops worldwide and by 
having heavy Advertising through the media?
<br>
You are absolutely right. A lot of very good development companies are
short of financial means, but there are also investors which are willing to
spend money - just like Gateway 2000, Inc. Heavy advertising through the
media's make only sense if we can offer the market new products.

<br>
<br>
6.  In a very recent interview for a German magazine, Amiga Plus according to the 
following rough English translation you said there will be new Amiga's from Amiga 
Inc.
<br>
"Amiga International, respectively Amiga Inc. will develop new Amiga models 
themselves. However, it is still open who will build and sell them, says Petro 
Tyschtschenko in an interview with Amiga Plus. He can imagine, that the Amiga 
group (AInc, AI) will do it themselves. On the other side, one could also imagine 
licensing the newly-developed concepts. 
<br>
<br.
The availability of the new Amiga models, announced for 1998 at the Computer 97 
will probably only happen in 1999. Their target is to make them available as soon 
as possible. Currently, there are many "hot talks". 
<br>
<br>
Is the above true that new Amiga models will come from Amiga Inc and Amiga 
International and why has this not been announced?

<br>
<br>
The statement you mentioned is right because as I explained already in your
Question 1, there will be developed new technology which will be licensed to
competent companies. In a discussion with Jeff Schindler I have learned that
this will happen in 1999. But remember this is an annual forecast, a plan and
not a commitment. 
<br>
<br>
Petro Tyschtschenko
<br>
<br>
Thanks to Petro Tyschtschenko for taking the time to answer these questions.  
Although some aspects of his answers are reasuring, there are no commitments.  
Over the last weeks I have been talking to Petro Tyschtschenko but I have found it 
very hard to get any firm commitments or for him to make policy but hopefully 
this will change for it needs to.
<br>
<br>
I think it was interesting to note that Petro Tyschtschenko has received contact from 
the big Software Publishers in the UK who use to make games for the Amiga.  
Hopefully this is a good indicator for the future of the Amiga Games Market.
<br>
<br>
If you want an opportunity to question the people behind the future direction of 
the Amiga such as Amiga Inc's Darreck Lisle, Jeff Schindler, Joe Torre, and Amiga 
International's Petro Tyschtschenko you can ask them the questions you want 
answered on the IRC conferences to be held from the Amiga '98 show in St. Louis.
