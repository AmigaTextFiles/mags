<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/chromanet/">Chroma</a> is pleased to 
announce the first in a regular series of monthly special
offers available from the Chroma website.

<P>"Mad March" specials include do-it-yourself (DIY) A1200 tower cases, A1200 
tower keyboard
adapters, Lola genlocks, CDR media and A1200 IDE interfaces.

<P>A taste of things to come is available on the same page, where details of
upcoming releases are included.  The first new release will be the "T-I-Y",
An A1200 Tower-It-Yourself kit consisting of a PC keyboard interface, an LED
adapter and a conversion guide with cutting templates. It`s aimed at A1200
owners who wish to "towerize", but have access to their own full-size PC tower
case.

<P>Watch out for a complete redesign of the Chroma site over the coming week 
or
so.
