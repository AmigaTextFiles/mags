<P>The <A HREF="http://www.icon-stl.net/~amiga/">Gateway Amiga Club 
Inc.</a> is happy to announce that their
Consignment Table is back by popular demand. Yes, we have
been asked to run the consignment table at the <A HREF="http://www.amiga-stl.com/show.html">Amiga98
Show</a> in St. Louis this weekend.  Here's how it works.

<P>You bring in any original disks, manuuals and hardware,
NO COPIES OF DISKS WILL BE ACCEPTED, and fill out a form.
We will place them on the consignment table. At the end
of Saturday or close of Sunday, you may pick up the
unsold items at no charge. If they do sell, you only
pay 10% of the price they sold for.

<P>You can't beat a deal like that. Only 10% to sell your
Amiga items and only if they are sold.

<P>Please note that although there is security scheduled
for the show, we will not assume responsibility for
lost or stolen items.

<P>See you at the show. The Gateway Computer Show-Amiga98
