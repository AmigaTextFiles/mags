The World Foundry Seeks A 3D Graphic Artist!</b>
</center>
<br>
Deimos Design / The World Foundry is looking for a talented 3D graphics
artist to join our team.  The person must be an experienced 3D artist,
and have a good sense of tasteful colour usage, lighting, etc..
<br>
<br>
The person should be able to dedicate a good amount of time to the project,
be self motivated, and willing / able to accept constructive critism.
An example of your work would be also a great advantage, although not
absolutely required.
<br>
<br>
Duties will include creating various textures (landscape, vehicles,
structures, people, etc.) objects, etc. for our upcoming game,
Maim & Mangle.  The ability to work in full 24bit colour is a plus (all
graphics will be rendered down to 8bit / 16bit colour sets for the
final version).
<br>
<br>
Tools of the trade should include a paint package, and a rendering / modeling
package of some sort.  The ability to load/save or convert to LW objects
is desirable, but again, not a mandatory requirement.
<br>
<br>
Payment.  This is always a sticky issue.  Payment will be in the form of
a full share of all royalties earned (please contact us for additional
details).  The accepted party will also become a member of the team and
have a full say in the future plans of the Deimos Design team.
<br>
<br>
Only dedicated people need apply, a lot of work lays ahead of us, and it is not for 
the meek of heart, or visit our websites.
