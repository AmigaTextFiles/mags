Paul Nolan is pleased to be able to give an exclusive preview of the
totally new <i>Photogenics Ng</i> at the upcoming Amiga98 show, March 13th 
to
15th. Although the name is still subject to change, (see
<A 
HREF="http://www.users.dircon.co.uk/~pnolan/newname.html">http://www.users.dircon.co.uk/~pnolan/newname.html</A>), enough core features
are in place to demonstrate the unparalleled level of creativity the
software will offer.

<P>Photogenics Ng aims to offer the user never before
seen levels of power and sophistication, whether creating works of art
from scratch, manipulating existing images, or creating professional
quality graphics for your web site.  In addition to alternating between
demos of Photogenics Ng and the Siamese System at his stand, he will also
be giving a free 45-minute seminar on the Saturday evening at 6pm.

<P>Further details of Photogenics Ng will be posted at:
