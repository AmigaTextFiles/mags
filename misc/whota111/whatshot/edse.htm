align=right>Evil's Doom is an Fantasy RPG from Olympia with the original version 
getting released as Shareware in 1996 but it really never hit the headlines of Amiga 
Magazines and the ones it did get into really liked it.  Many Amiga owners never 
got the chance to get this game but now you have a second chance with Titan 
Computer snapping it up and planning to release it comercially in the summer with 
it also being a Special Edition.

align=right>The graphics as you can well see are highly detailed and are hand 
drawn with it having dozens of characters and locations.  It will feature full motion 
video sequences along with a soundtrack to set the atmosphere.  
<br>
<br>
It has a 256 color HighRes display and requires AGA or a graphics card, an 020 
processor, 4MB Fast Ram, a double speed CD-Rom drive and at least 30MB's of 
hard disk space.

According to the publisher, Titan Computer a new demo will be released in the 
next few weeks and I will be looking forward to playing this demo for the last one 
was really entertaining.
