<CENTER><H2>Phase 5 Digital Products Announces Development of the 
Pre\Box, a PowerPC-Based Computer System with Amiga OS 
3.1</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<b>Taking The Next Step Towards PowerPC Multiprocessing, The Pre\Box Will 
Take Off to New
Performance Dimensions
</b>

<P>Beside the finalization of upcoming products such as the CyberVisionPPC and 
the
BVisionPPC graphics cards, <A HREF="http://www.phase5.de/">phase 5 digital 
products</a> has started a new development
project for a stand-alone, PowerPC-based computer system, called the pre\box, 
which will
use the licensed AMIGA OS 3.1 and a further advanced version of the PowerUP 
System
Software to provide Amiga compatibility on the AMIGA OS/Workbench 3.1 level 
under
CyberGraphX V3.

<P>"The license agreement that we have signed with Amiga International allows 
us to start
the development project of this new machine, which had been in conceptual design 
for
several months now. It is an important step for revitalizing the Amiga market,
encouraging developers and rebuilding a market which is strong enough to 
maintain" says
Wolf Dietrich, General Manager of phase 5. In a separate announcement Dietrich 
states
that the A\BOX, the long-term technology project of phase 5 digital products, is
postponed but not cancelled. "The A\BOX project will be continued with revised 
targets
and specifications and with extended resources, based on the succesful introduction 
of
the new product lines". Dietrich points out that the key for the survival of the 
Amiga
and the Amiga market is the availability of new outstanding stand-alone hardware
products as soon as possible, a goal which shall be reached with the pre\box 
design. "We
need an expanding market in the very near future, or the battle may be lost for the
Amiga computer system" he adds.

<P>The new pre\box machines will be targeting the medium and upper price 
regions for PCs or
Personal Workstations, but are designed to provide stunning performance. All 
systems
will come as multi-processing systems with at least four PowerPC CPUs installed, 
which
will allow them to provide an extremely high computing power at an outstanding
price/performance relation. "Multi-processing has been one of the most important 
goals,
if not THE most important design goal for phase 5 digital products in the past 18
months" explains Wolf Dietrich. "It is here where alternative technology can offer
advantages and superiority over the mainstream products in the PC market. While 
our
current PowerUP product line, which consists of upgrade cards for existing 
machines,
helps the user to update his system and secure the investments made in existing 
hardware
and software, it is a challenge to built new stand-alone hardware products which 
can
price-wise compete with the mainstream PCs - especially under the impression that 
PC
systems are blown out at dumping prices regularly, and that a PC system you buy 
today
maybe outdated and nearly worthless in less than a year." Consequently, the 
company does
not plan to build single-CPU systems which would have to compete at a similar
performance level with Intel-based systems, but wants to fully utilize the 
opportunities
which have been given with the move to the PowerPC. "Developers who jump on 
the PowerUP
bandwagon today can make their products ready for multiprocessing quite easily.
Therefore it will be possible to take two giant steps - from a single-CPU 68k system 
to
a Multi-CPU PowerPC system - within only one year, an impressive progress for the 
Amiga
community which many have not thought possible" Dietrich adds.

<P>The pre\box system is designed on a ATX formfactor motherboard and 
incorporates a fast
SDRAM-based memory subsystem with initially up to 100 MHz memory speed. 
Depending on the
actual bus speed of the PowerPC processors which are used, the processor bus also 
runs
at up to 100 MHz. The four PowerPC processors, which are located on a separate 
CPU card,
will be equipped with inline or backside caches, also depending on which type of
processor is actually used. As the PowerUP System Software features a
software-controlled cache coherency, the pre\\box can even be equipped with CPUs 
which
do not offer hardware support for multiprocessing, such as the PPC603e or the 
PPC750
(G3).

<P>The pre\box system also has an integrated 3D graphics subsystem, which is 
connected via
a 66 MHz PCI 2.1 bus with a peak performance of 264 MB/s and comes with eight 
MB of
graphics memory. With this gfx subsystem, a powerful standard is provided as the 
minimum
base configuration on which software designers can rely. But more than that: On 
the same
66 MHz PCI bus there is a special slot for a Voodoo2-based 3D accelerator card 
which is
directly coupled to the built-in gfx chip. "We plan to provide, either on our own or 
in
cooperation with other vendors, a Voodoo2-based solution as a powerful upgrade 
option"
comments Wolf Dietrich. "We will not forget the demands of the serious gamers."

<P>Also as standard, there will be an integrated Ultra-Wide SCSI-II controller and 
a 100
Mbit ethernet controller available, which will allow usage of todays powerful UW-
SCSI
devices and provide fast network connectivity - a feature which will also support the
distributed multiprocessing concepts of phase 5 digital products.

<P>For the use of inexpensive hardware expansions, a PCI bus with three standard 
PCI slots
is integrated. This PCI bus runs at 66 MHz, but will also accept 33 MHz PCI boards. 
With
the PCI bus integrated, development of new stunning hardware products for the 
pre\box
systems is quite easy; more than that, developers can use standard PCI products and
adopt them for the pre\box systems by simply writing software support for them.

<P>Yet not decided is, if there will be a socket for an optional 68k CPU left on 
the board.
"In this next-generation product, the consequent option for using 68k software will 
be
emulation. We are continuously encouraging Amiga developers to support our new 
MP
software technologies and guidelines which we introduced with our PowerUP 
System
Software, and those who follow these recommendations will be able to provide
applications that utilize the vast power of our upcoming pre\box system right away. 
This
is where efforts should be spend now" says Wolf Dietrich.

<P>Beside these main features, the pre\box will offer all standard functionality 
which is
expected from a computer system today, such as fast serial and parallel interfaces, a
USB bus, and an EIDE interface for use of e.g. inexpensive CD-ROM drives or 
additional
cheap harddrives.

<P>The pre\box release is scheduled for the early fourth quarter 1998. The 
pricing of the
pre\box system is already determined based on the current pricings for PowerPC
processors. Currently it is planned to offer the following versions of the pre\box 
with
the following suggested retail prices:

<P>pre\box 604/800 with four PPC604e-200 MHz CPUs  suggested retail price 
DM 3.995,-- / US$
1995.00/ UKP 1495.00 pre\box 604/1000 with four PPC604r-250 MHz CPUs  
suggested retail
price DM 4.995,-- / US$ 2495.00/ UKP 1895.00 pre\box 604/1200 with four 
PPC604r-300 MHz
CPUs  suggested retail price DM 6.995,-- / US$ 3395.00/ UKP 2595.00 pre\box 
750/1200
with four PPC750-300 MHz CPUs, each with 1 MByte Backside Cache  suggested 
retail price
DM 8.995,-- / US$ 4495.00/ UKP 3395.00

<P>These prices are valid for pre\box systems in an ATX minitower, including 
mouse and
keyboard, as well as AMIGA OS 3.1 and the PowerUP System Software, excluding 
memory,
harddrive and CD-ROM. For an entry-level configuration of memory, harddrive and 
CD-ROM
(32MB, 4GB, 24speed) an additional DM 750,-- (US$ 375.00 or UKP 275.00) must 
be
considered.

<P>(German and UK prices include VAT, US prices excl. local taxes, all prices are 
based on
the current currency exchange rates. Specifications and prices are subject to change
without prior notice).


<P>In order to support and encourage customers of PowerUP boards for existing 
Amigas, phase
5 digital products will offer substantial discounts on the purchase of pre\box systems
to owners of PowerUP boards. "We want to provide security for the investments of 
the
users today. Obviously, Amiga users and developers need to see a fast growing 
base of
PowerPC systems in these days, in order to support the progress of developments. 
We want
to encourage the users to invest in PowerPC technology now" comments Wolf 
Dietrich.
Owners of PowerUP boards who later take advantage of the discounts on purchases 
of a
pre\box system will not have to return their PowerUP boards to receive this 
discount,
but can continue to use their PowerUP-Amiga as a stand-alone system or even use 
it's
performance from the pre\box via a link system which will be provided with the 
pre\box,
and with which the networked multiprocessing feature of the PowerUP System 
Software can
be utilized.

<P>With this new product roadmap and variety of powerful and stunning 
products to come,
phase 5 digital products underscores it's position as the leading innovator in 
PowerPC
hardware and system software development in the Amiga market. "We want to 
further
support the Amiga market with these efforts" states Wolf Dietrich. "Part of our 
efforts
will also be to support the developers, and to encourage them to develop for 
PowerUP
with our best endeavours. We will do whatever is possible for us to make existing
developers stay with the Amiga, and will also try to win back Amiga developers 
who have
left the platform or put developments on hold. Recent releases of PowerUP 
compatible
software products, which had been realized within just a few weeks by their 
developers,
show how easy and efficiently existing Amiga software products can be ported to 
support
the new processor and performance generation. To convince software developers, 
we also
need to make them aware of the market potential and the outlook to the future 
that we
offer. All users can support these efforts, too, by contacting their favourite Software
vendors and requesting PowerUP versions of their software."
