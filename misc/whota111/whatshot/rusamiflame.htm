Opened</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Amiga Flame has Mirrors in the US, Italy with the Base site being in the UK, but 
now with the help of Amiga World in Russia - a Russian Amiga Flame Mirror of the 
UK Base site is up.
<br>
<br>
This will allow Russian Amiga Users easier and faster access to the Amiga Flame 
web site along with Amiga users in countries close to Russia.  Thanks must go to 
Alexey Emelyanov of Amiga World who have kindly provided this Mirror and it is 
good to see that there are even Amiga users in Russia.
