<P>For Immediate Release

<P>Friday, March 6th, 1998

<P>Nova Design, Inc., producers of the award winning ImageFX package and
Aladdin 4D package, are proud to announce that the shipping version of
ImageFX 3.0 will be premiered at Amiga '98 in St. Louis!

<P>ImageFX has been the required graphics application for all Amiga owners
and has been a part of Video Toaster/Flyer owner's toolkits for years.
Combining painting, image file format conversion, image processing, and
special effects, ImageFX is the undisputed leader in graphics
manipulation on the Amiga leading the pack in all markets worldwide.

<P>Highlights of ImageFX 3.0

<P>The interface still follows professional standards for the Amiga and the
video and film industry with its paintbox style approach. This has been
built on in ImageFX 3.0 to allow child menus to remain open for quick
access to frequently used functions, larger effects previews that you
can zoom in and out of and move around in, font sensitivity, multiple
image windows including the ability to open multiple windows for the
same image, real image layers that allow you to compose complex
composited images that can be modified over and over with ease, and many
other improvements throughout.

<P>Cross platform connectivity has been a top concern with ImageFX, from
its Video Toaster/Flyer support, to its wide range of image file format
support for all computer platform image formats. With this new release
ImageFX improves its Flyer support and also now gains support for the
Photoshop native file format so that layered images can be shared from
Photoshop to ImageFX. ImageFX also now directly supports loading, and
preserving, color-mapped (CMAP) image data for quick, accurate,
conversion of these formats.

<P>Special effects have always been one of the touchstones of the power of
ImageFX. From the earliest days ImageFX pioneered bringing high-end
"Hollywood-style" special effects to the desktop with it's morphing and
warping, wire removal, lightning and fire effects. The effects in this
release extend this even further!

<P>The all-new Clouds module allows you to generate true fractal clouds
that can animate their movement and evolve over time, via batch
processing, from one form to another. The clouds can be layered to
create three-dimensional effects and combine with custom, or supplied,
palettes to create wild plasma designs as well.

<P>Scatter is an amazing new effect that can shatter an image into pieces
as small as a single pixel and blast them apart in many different
patterns. This can be used for artistic designs or for dramatic
transitions.

<P>Also new in ImageFX 3.0 is Splash. Splash uses ray tracing and bump
mapping to create liquid simulations of rain, water ski surf, gelatinous
wiggles and more. The effect can be batched to animate puddles of
rainwater and create highly organic transitions.

<P>A classic effect from other computer platforms, Pagecurler, has been
added as well. This can add a cool curled page effect to the edge of an
image or make letters appear to peel off of the page!

<P>The true gem in the new effects is called FXForge. FXForge uses simple
mathematical expressions that, when applied against each pixel in the
image, can create hundreds upon hundreds of new effects. It uses a
superset of the same technology used in Adobeä Photoshop' s Filter
Factory plug-in and is completely compatible to formulas for effects
created for that package. Due to the overwhelming popularity of these
formulas, you can find hundreds, if not thousands, of them available on
the Internet. Experienced users can create these as well to extend their
toolkit of special effects on their own! Unique to ImageFX's FXForge is
the ability to animate the parameters and access ImageFX's swap buffer
for transitional effects as well!

<P>The Show's the Thing

<P>Look to get hands-on exposure to the new ImageFX 3.0 at Nova Design's
tables at the Amiga '98 show and also participate in the many ImageFX
training seminars to be held on both days of the show.  You'll be
astonished at all the new features listed here and many others that will
be shown for the first time at this show!
