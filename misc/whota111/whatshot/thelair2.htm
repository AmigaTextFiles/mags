Dear Fellow Amigans,

<P>        We here at The Lair are proud to announce the release of issue 12,
which is now online, at http://amigaworld.com/thelair/ .

<P>        This month, we have another issue packed with top reviews, articles
and opinions concerning recent developments, releases etc. in the Amiga
community.

<P>        In this issue, we have an interview with Fleecy Moss of the ICOA,
and an article on the Amiga Formula One scene. We also have a Javascript
tutorial, and you can contribute your ideas to the OS3.5 wishlist
initiative. The Aminet dig and forum pages are all there, as is Gatebert.

<P>        This months' issue also boasts a completely new interface featuring
frames, and we are also delighted to be able to announce a completely new
service: The Lairs' very own message board, where you can let off steam
about the mag, or any Amiga-related issues. It can be accessed through The
Lairs' pages, at the address below. Please read the instructions and FAQ
before posting to the board. We hope this new board will become a fun way to
interact with The Lair, and other Amiga users across the globe.

<P>        In short, we have another great issue for everyone to read this
month- as always, absolutely no subscription is necessary.

<P>        Best wishes to you all,

<P>Chris Hanretty, aka Obscure Reference, Editor<br>
