<p><H2>CUCUG Announces New Mirror Site in the Russian Federation</H2>

<P>March 11, 1998 - The <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/"
>Champaign-Urbana Computer Users Group (CUCUG)</A> announced today
that <A HREF="http://amigaworld.cch.pmc.ru/">AmigaWorld Russia</A>, a
new Amiga-oriented WWW service, would be hosting its popular World
Wide Web site. AmigaWorld Russia joins a coalition that now includes seven
active Internet service providers worldwide which are hosting the
Central Illinois user group's site.

<P>A process known as &quot;mirroring&quot; makes a nearly identical
copy of a Web site available to users closer to their own connection
on the Internet. This usually results in more reliable connects and
faster response.

<P>Other CUCUG mirrors are currently located in Australia, Italy,
Greece, Poland and Britain. The primary CUCUG site is maintained at
Champaign, Illinois in the United States.

<P>AmigaWorld Russia representative Alexey Emelyanov said, "We choose
the CUCUG web site to mirror for our Russian users because CUCUG
provides a complete combination of all the resources about the Amiga
and the Amiga community (including news stories, the Demo Scene,
etc.), CUCUG offers unique services and resources to support the Amiga
community (like the Agnes search engine) and the regular updates!"


<P>CUCUG maintains the award-winning <A 
HREF="http://www.cucugo.rg/amiga.html">Amiga
Web Directory</a> and <A 
HREF="http://www.cucug.org/agnes.html">Agnes</a>, an
advanced Amiga WWW search utility. Both have become very popular with
Amiga users throughout the world.

<P>The address for the new CUCUG mirror site in the Russian Federation is:

<P><A HREF="http://cucug.cch.pmc.ru/amiga.html" 
>http://cucug.cch.pmc.ru/amiga.html</A>
