<P>
Below is a post that was recently made to the comp.sys.amiga.games newsgroup on
Usenet.  It would seem that Andy Davidson is (at last :p) going to finish of the
updates to the worms series of games, read below for full details:-<P>

<UL><B>

Now things are a bit less hectic here at Team17 a bit (only a bit
though :) I'll have some time to hopefully finish off the patches for
Amiga Worms/WormsDC this week and next week.<P>

There are 3 of them:<P>

One for the Amiga Worms (ECS), which doesn't default to joypad on
machines with cd drives, is more stable, has a few other changes which
I can't remember, and removes the protection.  This was the last
version of Worms before it went AGA - I found the old files and got it
running again, after my Amiga being set up for WormsDC for the last
few years.  It will also be packed with an 040/060 friendly packer.<P>

A WormsDC upgrade for all Amigas - Option Set loading fixed, all other
small obscure bugs fixed (like dynamite replays occasionally going
wrong), keyboard can be used to enter names when using joypad, both
mouse+joypad work at the same time on title screen, improved rope,
fixed positioning/sizing of sleep window, rescan option to check for
new levels installed while the game is sleeping, cursor keys scroll
around in Graffiti Mode, cursor keys on numpad scroll around in game,
normal landscapes can be edited in Graffiti Mode after they are
generated (like Worms2), compatibility with MCP and runtime unpackers,
TAB on landscape generator cycles through landscape types, multiple
sample-sets for different teams ...  and other things that I've
forgotten :)<P>

After this upgrade all future updates will be for hdrive/fastram only
as the game is just getting too tight to run in 2meg and off floppies.<P>

The hdrive/fastram update will add the cdrom support.  This is the
reason for not having this done by now - I haven't had much time to
devote to WormsDC at all, and adding these features makes it too big
for standard machines.  I wanted to get a universal update done first.<P>

5 types of WormSelect and Manual Worm Placing (from Total Wormage) may
make it into both updates, along with some other stuff that isn't even
in Worms2 yet.<P>

All updates will be freely available and posted to Aminet as soon as
they are finished - like I said, hopefully in the next 2 weeks, but
things are still pretty mad at the moment with Worms2, the Worms2
expansion pack and the top-secret non-Worms game ... :)<P>

Thanks again for the support and comments from people who take a more
realistic view of the Amiga's situation - rather than just endless
criticism, slagging etc.  To see people on here slagging off a game
(BlitzBombers) which was being given away free - and is far better
than any of the post-Dynablaster alternatives (as it puts in more of
the features of the later Bomberman games) - is just another example
of how frustrating some Amiga owners make it for developers.
Criticism is good, when it's constructive ...<P>

Also, the buffulo may find its way into the game (If you don't hang around on
IRC, ignore this ;).....
