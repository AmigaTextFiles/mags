It's got a flexible game interface for controlling your forces and the enemy have 
artificial intelligence that provides plenty of challenge.  But if you want even better 
challenging action you can have a 2 player link up via serial cable or modem.  The 
one player action goes along the lines of a mission based game, there should be 
plenty.
