A couple of weeks ago I brought you news of an upcoming game called Hard Target
from Vulcan Software.  Well, now I can bring you Exclusive screenshots of what
is billed as being Virtual Cop on the Amiga.<P>

Going buy these screenshots, the game looks incredible.  And I for one am very
excited by this game.  Could this indeed be Virtual Cop for the Amiga?  Only
time will tell.<P>

Actual details on the game are low at the moment.  One thing I can tell you
however is the Amiga you will need to run it.  The game will require an AGA
Amiga with at least an 020, 2Mb Chip RAM and 8Mb Fast RAM.  It will also require a 4x speed
CD-ROM drive.  The interesting part of this is the fact that it will require 8Mb
Fast RAM, one of the first games on the Amiga to demand this.<P>

Anyway, for now have a look at the excellent screenshots on these pages. 
Hopefully I will be able to bring you more news soon...<P>
