<FONT SIZE="6">Command & Conquer Clone Roundup</FONT>
</CENTER> <HR> <p><FONT SIZE="4"> 
Ever since the release of Command & Conquer on the PC Amiga owners have been
eagerly awaiting a game of this type for the Amiga.  Only now are we beginning
to see rewards of the patient waiting.<P>

Ever since Dune 2 was released on the Amiga this type of game has become
increasenly popular, Command & Conquer was one of the biggest selling PC titles
ever and as always when a game does well on the PC the Amiga coders start doing
their best to try and beat it.<P>

Just take a look at the games we have coming our way, many of them are not just
clones of C&C but games that have built on this and the Dune II formula in a
massive way.<P>

<P>
Forgotten Forever has been in development since December last year and is
turning into what looks like an excellent game.  This is probably going to be
the first one that is released out of the games featured here and so has the
advantage of being the first one the market sees.<P>

Like most games today it will be released on CD-ROM only.  The game itself will
contain around 50-60 missions spread over 6 different terrains including snow,
rock, desert and forest.  On top of this there may be extra mission disks in the
future.<P>

There will also be a wide variety of different vehicles, probably around 20 or
so.  There will also be around the same amount of different buildings.<P>

The game will run in 256 colours and so will require AGA, however, it will also
support CyberGFX so graphic cards owners arn't left out.  It will also have
null-modem support and maybe even TCP support for multiplayer games.  Other
features include digital speech, locale support and full multi-tasking.<P>

This is a relitively newly announced game.  It is from the same team that
created Strangers which has recently been released by Vulcan Software.  Now
Strangers is out of the way work on Diversia is storming forward.<P>

The game will run in High Resolution with 256 colour graphics.  As you can tell
from the screenshot this helps the game look very good.  The game also boasts
some excellent enemy intelligence, something that is needed in a game like this.
It will also feature a CD soundtrack and will hopefully be network playable,
this will, so I'm told also include TCP play.<P>

The authors are also planning to implement Power PC and CyberGFX
support.  Like a lot of the games coming out now the game requires quite a
powerful Amiga.  Currently it requires an AGA/CyberGFX Amiga with at least an
030 and 4Mb Fast RAM.  The game will be released on CD only format.  There will
be probably be a demo available towards the end of September.<P>

This is probably the most exciting of all the projects under development. 
Instead of just copying the C&C formula this game will greatly expand on it.<P>

On of the most exciting parts of this game are what the developer is planning to
do graphics wise.  The game will contain full light-sourcing, explosions will
light up the surrounding area, vehicles will have headlights and bases will have
searchlights, all these come into play when you have to partake in the
night-time missions which the game will feature.<P>

Another excellent plus point for this game is that the landscape wil be true 3D,
this means that hills will obscure a units line of sight, units will be able to
hide in valleys, trees and canyons.  Also units will move faster when going
downhill and artillery will have a further range when at the top of a hill. 
The game will also include extensive weather effects.<P>

The game will also include a massive research & development section.  TCP
support, level editors and lots more will be available in this game.  Look out
for more on this very exciting game comign your way soon.<P>

The game will be released on a CD-ROM only format sometime next year.<P>

These are only a few of the C&C like games that are in development for the
Amiga.  Due from Vulcan quite soon is Scions of the Forgotten World, this is
more of a Warcraft game really but looks like it could be a hit.  There is also
Hard Corps from Geosync Productions, The Game, SpaceLander and quite a few
others all of which I will bring you news on when I have it.<P>
