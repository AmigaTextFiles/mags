Hello,<P>

Welcome to the third issue of the Amiga Nutta games magazine.<P>

I was hoping to get the developers/publishers list ready for this issue but due
to things beyond my control I couldn't.  Hopefully I will have it sorted for
the next issue along with the Highscores table.<P>

There have been quite a few new releases recently but there has yet to be that
game that really stands out from the rest, infact, I'd go as for as saying that
the releases have been pretty dire.  We have had Flyin' High which was in my
opinion a massive disappointment, as for Trapped 2, well, it has it's good
points but there are a few gameplay issues that let it down quite a lot.  Then
there is Strangers, which despite the bad reviews it got I didn't think was that bad
a game, it has the gameplay, the graphics ain't too hot but whats more
important?<P>

So when will we get the game thats stands out above everything else and shows
what the Amiga can do?  Well, there are a fair few games that look like they will stand out from the crowd
coming out soon, hopefully they won't dissapoint.  This brings onto something
else I have been wondering about.  What games are you most looking forward too? 
Why not send me a list and I'll put all I get into the magazine to see what the most
eagerly awaited game is.  On second thoughts, I'll get a small survey sorted
out, I think i would be quite interesting.  Look out for this next issue.<P>

What new games news do we have this week?  Well, there is an update on
Foundation, along with some exclusive pictures of it.  There is also some
exclusive news on a new beat-em-up coming our way, it isn't just any old
beat-em-up though.  It is a texture mapped, polygon based 3D beat-em-up similar
to Tekken and Virtual Fighter.  Sounds very exciting.<P>

Oh, by the way, I still haven't received any letters or tips from you lot yet, 
so get writing! :)<P>

Anyway, until the next issue....<P>
