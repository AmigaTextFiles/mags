</CENTER> <HR> <p><FONT SIZE="4"> 
<B>Trauma Zero is a new Shoot-em-up that is being developed by a new Italian
team.  Details are quite low at the moment but from what I can tell from the
rolling demo which has been released, the game looks fantastic.</B><P>

Like I say, the game looks very good.  It contains 256+ colour graphics, and
scrolls at a super smooth 50hz.  Another feature of the game is that it will
feature a simultanias 2-player option.  The game is AGA and will also be
HD-Installable.<P>

I will hopefully be able to bring you more details on the game very soon..<P>

For now have a look at thr rolling demo yourself:-<P>
