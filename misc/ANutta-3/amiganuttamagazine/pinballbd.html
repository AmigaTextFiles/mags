<H1>Pinball Brain Damage.</H1>
</CENTER> <HR> <p><FONT SIZE="4"> 
You may remember this game from a news item I done on this game a few months ago.  Well
since then quite a few things have changed.  The biggest of which has to be that
Vulcan will no longer be publishing the game, instead, it will now be published
by APC&TCP.  They have now released some new details on the game.<P>

The game will include Hi-Res table graphics (640x256) with 256 colours in normal
mode and Super-Hi-Res (1280x512) in multiball mode.  The highest resolution
ever used in a Amiga pinball game and probably any Amiga game.  The multiball
mode is promised to be the best so far.<P>

The game will include many different modes with animations and soundtracks to
fit the theme of each table.  The game will also incoporate Pseudo 3D table
rendering, which promices to make the game even more realistic.<P>

It will require an AGA Amiga with 2Mb Chip RAM and either a Hard-drive
(For the Disk version) or a CD-ROM (For the CD version).<P>

One other thing that is worth mentioning is that the CD-ROM version will include
a table editor so you can make your own tables.  This is something that has been
talked about before but never actually done, it will be very interesting to see
if the programmers can pull this one off.<P>

The game should be getting a Disk and CD-ROM release towards the end of the
year.<P>
