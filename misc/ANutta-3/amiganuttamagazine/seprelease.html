<H1>Whats Out in September?</H1>
</CENTER> <HR> <p><FONT SIZE="4"> 
September looks as though it will be a good month for games releases.  The
following games are set for release in this month:-<P>

BORDER="10">
<B>Strangers AGA</B> <I>(Vulcan)</I> - An excellent looking Renegade like beat-em-up that was due in
late August, but hasn't arrived yet.  It is certain to come out early September,
delays have been due to duplication problems, but these have hopefully been
sorted out now.  This will be Vulcans first CD release, so it is quite a big
step for them.  The game boasts many features such as allowing 6 players to
play at once, 32 fighters all with there own intelligence, a massive range of
moves and much more.  Certainly one to look out for.<P>

<B>Uropa² - the Ulteria Colony</B> <I>(Vulcan)</I> - Another CD release by Vulcan.  This is an
excellent isometric adventure/vector shoot-em-up.

Was released as Shareware
earlier this year but was quickly picked up by Vulcan for a commercial release. 
Will contain amounst other great things some excellent sampled speach.  The
shareware release was excellent and I had the pleasure of being able to review
the game, hopefully, Vulcan will have made improvments that will
make it an all round better game.<P>

<B>Trapped 2</B> <I>(Oxyron)</I> - The follow-up to the not too well received Trapped.  A 3D RPG
with some excellent graphical effects (Online readers can find a preview of this
on the pages).  Although the game uses a Doom type engine that game is far
different and from what I can tell from the latest demo released this is going
to be an excellent game, probably the best Doom/RPG game of the year.  I suggest
you all try the demo for this game (Available from Aminet and the Cellular BSS
amounst others)<P>

<B>Sixth Sense Investigations</B> <I>(Epic Marketing)</I> - An adventure in the mould
of the old LucasArts games.  A demo was recently available on the CU
Amiga/Amiga Format coverdisks.  Didn't look too bad, but certainly didn't, in
my opinion come anyways near the classic Monkey Island series.  Maybe I will be
proved wrong....<P>
<IMG SRC="images/sword.gif" ALT="Sword Screenshot" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>Sword</B> <i>(ATP&TCP)</i> - A platform game that not many people seem to know
about.  Looks quite nice, there will be both a disk and CD-ROM release of this
one.  A game along the line of Rick Dangerous is what this is, very smooth with
nice graphics.  A game that brings back the memories of the old days when every
other Amiga game was a platformer, this however, looks like it could beat all of
them.<P>
<P>

<B>Hover Bomber</B> <i>(Aurora Works)</I> - This is a Bomberman game with a
difference.  Instead of just copying the old formula, Aurora Works have brought
it up to date.  Instead of being restricted to laying you bombs in a grid
format you can place them anywhere you want.  The game features some excellent
graphics from the well known graphic artist Eric Schwartz.  It also sports a
four player option, something that is made even better by the fact that TCP/IP
support is featured.  Could be the game of the month..<P>

Quite a list there, if all goes to plan it looks like it could be an expensive
September.<P>
