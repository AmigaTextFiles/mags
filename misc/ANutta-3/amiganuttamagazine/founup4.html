Foundation is advancing faster then ever now, and with the November release date
getting closer & closer, the game is generating a hugh level of excitment amoung
Amiga owners.<P>

The latest addition to the game is the fighting element, and as you can see from the
latest screenshots of the game on this page it is looking very nice.<P>

On another note the TCP section of the game is currently being worked on,
hopefully allowing users from all over the world to play against each other. 
This would be great news for Amiga owners and is something that will probably
makes my phonebill even higher then it already is.  There is even talk of
setting up a permanant Foundation internet server which people will be able to connect
to and play Foundation.<P>

This game is shaping up to be one hell of a game and I can't emphasise the fact
enough that we need to keep programmers like Paul Burkey and Publishers like
Sadeness with the Amiga, the best way of doing this?  By buying Foundation. 
Don't wait around and wait for it's release, pre-order yourself a copy now and
be one of the first people to get what I believe will be the best game of 1997.

If you really need convincing that this game is that good, there will be a demo
of it available in the not too distant future.

As for the final game it will be available in November/Decemeber<P>

If you have any questions regarding Foundation then you can Email the publishers

Page.</a><P>

I suggest you check this out first to avoid wasting precious time as your
question may have already been answered here.<P>

Pre-Orders are now being taken for Foundation by Sadeness Software, remember if
you order from them more money will go to the Developer then if you order from
another company, and I'm sure you'll agree he deserves all he gets.  No money
will be debited from your account until the game is released
(November/December).  To place your order fill out the form on the Sadeness
website.  <A
