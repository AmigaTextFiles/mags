I'm sure many of you have played at least one of the Gloom series of games.  It
is considered by many to be one of the best Doom clones on the Amiga. 
Hopefully, with the addition of Gloom 3 to the series this good reputation will
continue.<P>

It may seem odd to some of you that Gloom 3 has actually arrived on the Amiga
considering Black Magic (The original programming team) have long since quit from programming for it.  Well,
it goes something like this.  Gloom 3 isn't actually from Black Magic, it is
instead, from a new company called Alpha Software.  They decided that since
Gloom was such a good game it was worth another release, this time, however,
instead of coming on disk the game will be on CD-ROM.<P>

The game engine which is used is virtually identical to the Gloom Deluxe engine.
The improvments to the game have come in other areas.  For example, Gloom 3 will
include 50 new levels, spanning over 7 stages!!  There will also be around ten
new nasties included the game, with all new GFX and sound.<P>

The game will also improve the fun for multiplayer games.  There will be 30 new
2-player combat levels included, which will also contain zombies to make things
that bit harder.  Modem support will also be improved with a much wider range of
modems being supported.<P>

To run the game at a decent speed you will require a decent spec Amiga. 
Although you can actually run the game on a base A1200, it will be slow in all
but the smallest of screenmodes.  To get a decent game out of it, it is
reccommended that you have at least an 030 with 4Mb FAST.  To play the game in
the 1x1 screenmode an 040/060 is recommended.<P>

As is the trend with a lot of recent games graphic card owners will not be left
out.  The game will support GFX cards allowing you to play the game in
extremally high resolutions.  You will also be able to play the game in a
workbench window, although this isn't recommened unless you have a very powerful
Amiga.<P>

The game will be released by Guildhall Leisure and Epic Marketing, hopefully in
time for Christmas.<P>
