</CENTER> <HR> <p><FONT SIZE="4"> 
I have just received news on a game that sounds amazing.  It is a beat-em-up
being written by a group called Deepcore Entertainment Software.<P>

It isn't just any old beat-em-up though, have a look at Virtual Fighter and
Tekken on the consoles and you'll have an idea of what this game is like.  It is
a true 3D, polygon based, texture mapped beat-em-up, something that has never
been seen on the Amiga before.<P>

Info on the game is quite low at the moment, however, I can tell you that you'll
need quite a powerful machine to play it on.  The game requires at least an
AGA/CyberGFX machine with an 030 for the 320x200, 2x2 resolution and an 040 for
the 320x200, 1x1 resolution.  It will also require 2Mb Chip RAM and 8Mb Fast
RAM. <P>

The game is being scheduled for a Summer '98 release on CD-ROM only.<P>

I'll have more info for you soon...<P>
