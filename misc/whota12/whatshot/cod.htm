<IMG SRC="images/cod01.jpg" ALT="Child of Darkness" ALIGN="RIGHT">News 
has just come in on a game called the Child Of Darkness.  The Child Of Darkness is 
a new top-down RPG game with great graphics and full Manga style animated film 
sequences in development by Desktop Corruption, a group of dedicated Amiga 
coders spread arounf the world (UK, USA, Sweden) who have come together on the 
internet to form a new coding group.
<br><br>
The Child of Darkness mixes the old Zelda type game to modern Beat-em-ups with 
good old RPG characters with speech and puzzles to provide a very interesting mix.  
<br><br>
Its characters features are controlled by sophisticated AI routines, so the game will 
always play differently, even if you completed it once before.  It runs along a 
detailed story with each level viewed as a chapter of which you can read the 
prologue, the script for the animated introduction in the game.  
<br><br>
At the moment, the requirements aren't fully available yet, but it will support AGA.
<br><br>
