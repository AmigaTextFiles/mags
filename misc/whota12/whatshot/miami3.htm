<li>The user interface (formerly MUI) is now located
                in a separate program module. This introduces the
                following possibilities:<ul>
                    <li>Miami can be used with a MUI user
                        interface (as in earlier versions), or
                        without MUI, using a user interface based
                        on GadTools and GTLayout. A GUI module
                        for ClassAct is planned for a later time.</li>
                    <li>When &quot;Iconify&quot; is used to close
                        the Miami window, Miami can optionally
                        close all GUI libraries (e.g. MUI), and
                        remove the GUI module from memory. In
                        particular with MUI this can save a lot
                        of memory.</li>
                    <li>It is possible to open and close the user
                        interface at any time, and to switch
                        between different GUI engines while Miami
                        is running.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Miami now fully supports DHCP, incl. limited-time
                IP address leases, and should now be compatible
                to the most popular cable modem setups.</li>
            <li>MS-CHAP is now fully supported, i.e. even
                Windows-NT servers which have been configured to
                require &quot;Microsoft password encryption&quot;
                can be accessed. (Only in the registered version,
                requires MiamiSSL).</li>
            <li>SOCKS V4/V5 proxy servers are transparently
                supported for the majority of Amiga Internet
                applications.</li>
            <li>The utility programs MiamiRegister, MiamiInit and
                MiamiInitSANA2 have been significantly improved.</li>
            <li>Many small improvements have been made, e.g.
                better modem control, the modem connection speed
                is displayed, database entries can be
                individually disabled etc.</li>
        </ul>
