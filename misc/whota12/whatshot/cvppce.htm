The following article was obtained from Phase 5's web site and is about the 
CyberVisionPPC graphics card.  So if you're interested, read on.
<P>
The CyberVisionPPC is a high-performance graphic card which can be installed on
the expansion slot of the PowerPC604e-based PowerUp accelerators, the Cyberstorm
PPC and the Blizzard 2604 Power Board. It is scheduled for delivery in the fourth 
quarter
of 1997, and will become available simultaneously with the Blizzard 2604 Power 
Board.
Especially for the Blizzard 2604 the use of the CyberVisionPPC is highly
recommended as the slow access to the ECS chip memory or Zorro-II-based graphics
boards in the A1500/A2000 may limit the system performance in applications with
lots of graphic output. The performance of the CyberVisionPPC benefits from the 
high data bandwidth
achieved by the use of the direct connection to the processor bus by use
of the graphics direct connector which incredibly speeds up for example
3D rendering and display.<P> 
Not only the ultra-fast access of the processor
into the video memory, but also the internal speed and functionality of the
CyberVisionPPC will provide a breathtaking performance. The CyberVisionPPC is
equipped with the powerful PERMEDIA2 graphics controller, which provides an
outstanding 3D performance of up to 80 million textured 3D pixels per second,
with hardware-accelerated rendering functions such as z-buffering,
gouraud-shading, fogging, blending and anti-aliasing. As the design of the
PERMEDIA2 hardware suits perfectly for OpenGL implementations, it's 3D
performance can support the CyberGL functionality of CyberGraphX V3 Native which
comes along with the PowerUp boards. In combination with the high floating-point
performance of the PowerPC604e processor a breathtaking performance in
professional 3D applications can be achieved by this implementation.
Additionally, the PERMEDIA2 processor supports functions like color space
conversion, chroma keying and XY-scaling which will be used by the software MPEG
decoding routines of CyberGraphX V3 Native.<P>  
Memory on the CyberVisionPPC is 64 bit wide SGRAM with data throuput upto
800MB per second which results on use of the ultra fast RAMDAC in the possibility
to display upto 1280x1024 in true color at 85 Hz screen refresh rate and
1600x1200 in true color at 60 Hz or high color at 85 Hz. The board will be 
delivered
with 4 MB or 8 MB display memory.<BR>
