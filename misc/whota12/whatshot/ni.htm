<b>September 27, 1997</b> - <A 
HREF="http://www.amiganet.org/NewIcons/">Team
NewIcons</a> is proud to announce the latest release of their
revolutionary GUI icon enhancement system, NewIcons version 4.0. The
NewIcons system transparently allows up to 256 color icons on the
Amiga Workbench, and is supported by several Workbench enhancements
such as Scalos and Directory Opus Magellan.  Included with this
release is a stunning new set of 32 color icons, as well as remarkable
improvements in NewIcons' speed and functionality.

The NewIcons package includes the DefIcons utility, which transforms all those
iconless files on your hard drive into visually identifiable virtual icons on the fly as 
they load into an opening Workbench window.  Deficons recognizesover a hundred 
different filetypes and identifies them almost instantly during loading.

<P>Most notably, the NewIcons System has the following new features:

<ul>
<li> Large speed increases with icon loading/rendering

<li> Optionally shadowed or outlined icon text for easy legibility on all
  Workbench backdrops.

<li> Transparent icons (no more ugly borders) that remain transparent when you
  drag them.

<li> New Utilities to convert all drawers in a directory or partition to a user
  selected image.

<li> Beautiful 32-color icon set and palette, which is backwards compatible with
  prior icon releases - a Workbench pen saving feature.

<li> and much, much more.
</ul>

<P>NewIcons is directly supported in many commercial products, including 
Cloanto's
Personal Paint 7, GPSoft's Directory Opus Magellan, and dozens of other
commercial, shareware and freeware packages.   Team NewIcons is also proud to
announce that NewIcons comes preinstalled on all Micronik tower systems sold
by Blittersoft.


<P>Team NewIcons releases this software free of charge, a freeware gift with our
thanks to the Amiga community.  We look forward to the future of the Amiga
Operating System, with our hope that palette independent icons will be
included as a default standard with future versions of AmigaOS.

<P>The NewIcons System can be obtained from the Official NewIcons Support 
Site at
