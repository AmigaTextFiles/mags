</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Chris Korhonen is to begin production of a new Space Station Management 
Simulation.  But help is needed in it's development as he is looking for a few 
people to help in programming, music and graphics.  It would also help if you 
could e-mail any ideas you might think of.
<br>
<br>
Below is full details of this exciting new Space game.

First of all you select your race, and status:
<br>
<br>
-Military Status : Works for military, little freedom but you get lots
of supplies/crew/fighters supplied to you. You also get defensive
support.
<br>
<br>
-Corperate Status : Employee of large corperation, bit more freedom
than military, attracts pirates, start with lots of £££. Well supplied
but weak ships/defenses.
<br>
<br>
-Freelance : Start with large ship and limited capital, total freedom,
no defense, nothing supplied to you.
<br>
<br>
You would start by selecting a star system. Earth, etc. has a
lot of competion so it would be harder. An isolated system/unxplored
has little competition.  You can either use a large ship as a basis
for your station, or have one specially built. A purpose built one is
expensive, but flexably, whereas a ship is limited.. You decide its
location and which planet... You have a limited amount of funds and
you have to make the space station a sucess...
<br>
<br>
You can help design the station or you can choose between several
basic structures depending on your race. After 6 months the space
staion/ground base is completed and you begin.....
Decide a name for your station. You would have options to rent out
areas to shops, businesses etc.
<br>
<br>
You have control over docking fees and room prices. Once you declare
the station operational the fun begins.......
<br>
<br>
You will be able to :
<br>
<br>
- Check on the competiton, ie. fees, facilities etc.
<br>
- Declare independance from governent/ Defect to opposing side
<br>
- Sell advertising space on the interior, exterior and on your fighters!
<br>
- Get involved with illegal trading, ie. purchase small station on the rim and use it 
as a front for illegal doings...... 
<br>
- Own many stations 
<br>
- Expand space and ground based staions 
<br>
- Arm station and build a fleet to defend the station 
<br>
- Meet with alien ambassadors (and blow them up)
<br>
- Sabotage other stations, by blockadeing, bombing or sabotageing facilities/docking 
bays 
<br>
- manage air traffic 
<br>
- be affected by wars, pirates, blockades, attacks...
