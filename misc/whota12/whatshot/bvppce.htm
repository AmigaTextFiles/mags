The following article was obtained from Phase 5's web site and is about the 
BVisionPPC graphics card.  So if you're interested, read on.
<P>
The BVisionPPC is a high-performance graphic card which can be installed on
the expansion slot of the PowerPC603e-based PowerUp accelerators, the BLIZZARD 
603e
and the BLIZZARD 603e+ Power Board. It is scheduled for delivery in the fourth 
quarter
of 1997, and will become available simultaneously with the BLIZZARD 
603e/BLIZZARD 603e+ Power Board.
The performance of the BVisionPPC benefits from the high data bandwidth
achieved by the use of the direct connection to the processor bus by use
of the graphics direct connector which incredibly speeds up for example
3D rendering and display.<P> 
Not only the ultra-fast access of the processor
into the video memory, but also the internal speed and functionality of the
BVisionPPC will provide a breathtaking performance. The BVisionPPC is
equipped with the powerful PERMEDIA2 graphics controller, which provides an
outstanding 3D performance of up to 80 million textured 3D pixels per second,
with hardware-accelerated rendering functions such as z-buffering,
gouraud-shading, fogging, blending and anti-aliasing. As the design of the
PERMEDIA2 hardware suits perfectly for OpenGL implementations, it's 3D
performance can support the CyberGL functionality of CyberGraphX V3 Native which
comes along with the PowerUp boards. In combination with the high floating-point
performance of the PowerPC603e processor a breathtaking performance in
professional 3D applications can be achieved by this implementation.
Additionally, the PERMEDIA2 processor supports functions like color space
conversion, chroma keying and XY-scaling which will be used by the software MPEG
decoding routines of CyberGraphX V3 Native.<P>  
Memory on the BVisionPPC is 64 bit wide SGRAM with data throuput upto
800MB per second which results on use of the ultra fast RAMDAC in the possibility
to display upto 1280x1024 in true color at 85 Hz screen refresh rate and
1600x1200 in true high color at 60 Hz. The board will be delivered
with 4 MB display memory.<BR>
