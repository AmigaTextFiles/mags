<CENTER><H2>Phase 5's response to Haage & Partner's WarpUp
</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The following is a statement from Phase 5's web site regarding Haage & Partner's 
WarpUp software, with a more detailed statement coming out as soon as I get it.
<P>
Phase 5 digital products is shipping the PowerUp boards as a complete solution,
consisting of the powerful dual-processor hardware and the comprehensive
PPC library and other stuff. The PPC library is a complete PPC native multitasking
and multiprocessing kernel. It features everything that is necessary for
all kind of software developments, even for adoption of different or future
OS versions. The information about disadvantages and slow communication
between the two CPUs is nonsense, as our system software provides a 
comprehensive
message and signalling system, which even provides protectable memory areas
for each task, making PowerUp-compliant software ready for future memory-
protected
OS updates or versions.</P>

<P>Now, Haage&amp;Partner, a german software developer who had been 
supported
by phase 5 digital products as a PowerUp developer, have released a product
called WarpUp, which is an incompatible replacement of the PowerUp system
software from phase 5 digital products. This software is announced with
a long list of features and pretended advantages over the PowerUp System
Software, thus giving the impression of more comprehensive functionality
and better performance, what can not be prooven by facts and it based on
assumptions by Haage&amp;Partner.</P>

<P>AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE FUNCTIONALITY WHICH HAAGE&amp;PARTNER 
OUTLINES
AND PROMOTES IS NOTHING SPECIAL, BUT A STANDARD FUNCTIONALITY 
PROVIDED BY
THE PHASE 5 POWERUP SYSTEM SOFTWARE. We simply did not make so much 
noise
about it. It is also nonsense that the WarpUp software by Haage&amp;Partner
is faster then the PowerUp system software from phase 5 digital products;
this may only be true when StormC is used for the compilation a PowerUp
application.</P>

<P>The WarpUp from Haage&amp;Partner is a solution which is not compatible
to the phase 5 solution. As it does not use the HAL that is provided by
phase 5 digital products, but hacks the hardware by using an incomplete
knowledge of the hardware functionality - which has been aquired by reengineering
the phase 5 digital products software - it is most likely that it will not
work with future revision changes or different product releases of the PowerUp
series.</P>

<P>Furthermore, phase 5 digital products will not tolerate that an incompatible
software takes over the control of the PowerUp hardware and prevents the
user from running software that has been developed for the PowerUp boards
by phase 5 digital products as well as many other vendors. All software
which is supplied by phase 5, and in which we have invested lots of work
and financial efforts to make the PowerUp a useful product, would be disabled
once the Haage&amp;Partner software is installed in the system. That includes
for example the fast CyberGL native library as well as the MPEG video and
audio decoding integrated into CGX V3.</P>

<P>Consequently, third party products using such advanced functionality
would not run. USAGE OF THE HAAGE&amp;PARTNER SOLUTION WOULD RESULT
IN A COMPLETE INCOMPATIBILITY MESS. In the interest of our customers, who
buy our products with high expectations, and all our developers who expect
a completely compatible product line, we will take care that the phase 5
system software can not be disabled.</P>

<P>Haage&amp;Partner has - from the beginning - rejected to use the ELF
binary format which phase 5 has introduced on the PowerUp boards. The reason
to choose this widely accepted format was to open the Amiga/PowerUp 
development
to industry software standards. As an example, the ELF format allows professional
development for PowerUp even on other platforms (such as Motorola PPC systems,
IBM AIX systems, even on Sun or under WindowsNT), where high performance
PPC Cross compilers are available, which integrate far superior experience
and performance; phase 5 is currently testing such compilers which may offer
the chance to accelerate software such as the CyberGL native library and
the PPC MPEG library even further. Additonally, soon an update for SAS/C
on the Amiga can be expected, which supports PowerUp and the ELF format.</P>

<P>Haage&amp;Partner, instead, wants to establish their own &quot;extended
Hunk-format&quot;, which may is derived from the Amiga Hunk format, but
still a new and proprietary solution. It is a concept that forces developers
to use the only solution supporting this format - the Storm C compiler by
Haage&amp;Partner. Haage&amp;Partner declares it's product being open and
Amiga-compliant - in fact, it is only open to the Haage&amp;Partner standard
and compliant to their own software solutions.</P>

<P>At this point, it is important to mention that the software concepts
of phase 5 digital products have all the time been focused on developments
that open doors and smooth upgrade paths to future and completely revised
OS versions, which incorporate functionalities such as memory protection
and multi-processing (which is not supported by the Haage&amp;Partner concept,
BTW). This has e.g. also been proposed to Amiga International/Gateway2000
in May this year, together with our offer for extensive technological cooperation.
To reach such a goal, we feel it is mandatory to set today guidelines for
programming that make current Amiga/PowerUp developments more independent
from the current OS revision by clear structured and object-oriented programming,
instead of using the StormC concept of simply recompiling older sources
(this issue will be adressed in detail later). </P>

<P>As the solution from Haage&amp;Partner is not compatible and can - because
of it's proprietary software concept - not fullfill demands of professional
developers, it is very unlikely that developers will choose it. phase 5
digital products highly recommends not to use this incompatible system,
as well as the Storm C compiler which - because of the concept - is wasting
most of the performance that the PowerUp boards can deliver (this issue
will also be adressed in detail later).</P>

<P>phase 5 digital products has supported Haage&amp;partner with free 
developer
systems, as well as all necessary information to develop compatible software
and tools, thus enabling Haage&amp;Partner to become a leading software
vendor. We also held many meetings explaining our strategy and goals to
make the PowerUp a useful platform not only for a new generation of high-
performance
applications, but also for the development towards a new OS or OS version
that fullfills the demands of the next century. To our surprise and disappointment
Haage&amp;Partner has mainly used their status to create a replacement for
the PowerUp system software which is intended to set a standard controlled
by Haage&amp;Partner, and they even attempt to trash the complete and 
comprehensive
software development in which we have spend many efforts. At the same time,
they have yet not been able to present a stable running PowerPC application
which the Amiga/PowerUp user would have an advantage from. We highly 
disregard
this contraproductive and confrontational behaviour, and will completely
drop any support for Haage&amp;Partner as a PowerUp developer as well as
for any of their products.
