Starfighter an space action game from developers GeoSync Media has gone through 
major changes with a new graphics standard.  Andy Hawkins of GeoSync Media has 
annnounced that this will be the new graphics standard for all it's titles.
<br>
<br>
The demo from their web site includes Battleships, Cruisers and tonnes more of 
which you can destroy or protect if they are yours. This game has been well 
designed and thought out with the gameplay that really makes a good game.  The 
new graphics will definitely add to this excellent Shareware game. <br>
<br>
According to GeoSync Media we should also look for more games coming from 
them in 1997 and into 1998.
