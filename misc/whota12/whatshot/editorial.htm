Hi,
<p>
This is the second editorial for the What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine, and a lot 
has happened since the release of the first issue, I have already had two offers of 
web space for an on-line version of What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine.  But, will 
still accept any other offers that are made, as it will be probably the end of October 
before, What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine is on-line.  And thanks to those, who 
have already donated some web space, they will definitely be receiving a mention 
in the next issue.
<p>
This issue contains a lot of articles on Phase 5 from information on the forthcoming 
BVisionPPC and CyberVisionPPC graphic cards and the Haage & Partner WarpUp 
dispute.  But, there is a still of other news out there, such as a number of articles 
on upcoming games, Cloanto's Amiga Forever and an exclusive on Miami 3.0.
<P>
Now this month's, Site Of The Month is <A 
HREF="http://www.amigaflame.co.uk">Amiga Flame</A>, who have just recently 
move their UK mirror to a new server and in the process, Amiga Flame has 
undergone a number of changes.  Amiga Flame is one of the best site for finding 
the latest news on Amiga games and is definitely one site to keep going to on a 
regular basis. 
<p>
In the next issue, there will be a number of articles on more games, along with 
other stuff, more information on Nova Sector Engineering's new Amiga 
compatible computers, a large collection of Foundation screenshots and more links added to the Links Section.
<P>
Before, I end this issue's editorial, I'm trying to get What's Hot On The Amiga 
Magazine on the web, so if you have any free web space out there, then e-mail at:
<p>
<A 
HREF="mailto:imortimer@jupmqljb.demon.co.uk">imortimer@jupmqljb.demon.co.
uk</A>
<P>
At the moment, I've received two offers of free web space for an on-line edition, 
but will greatly appreciate any more offers.
<P>
Hope that you enjoy this issue, and will read the upcoming issues.
<P>
See you,
<P>
