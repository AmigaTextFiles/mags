and also supporting Network play.<P>

It can be seen from the screenshots that Diversia has some very colourful and are 
extremelly detailed and the explosions are nothing short of brilliant.<P>
The game itself will require at least an 030 with 4Mb Fast RAM, at least a 4x CD-
ROM drive.  The game is planned to support PowerPC processors and already 
supports GFX boards.<P>
The game is just over 50% complete, with the demo about 97% complete.  So, in 
the meantime, enjoy the screenshots.<P>
