<CENTER><H2>SASG International Announces MagicWB 2.1p Released for Free 
Download</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Following popular demand, MagicWB 2 (which was previously only available
through prior registration) is now for the first time publically available
as fully installable shareware version.  Get it if you still have the old
and outdated MagicWB 1.2p running on your system or if you haven't yet
installed MagicWB...

<P>
This version is fully installable and usable, hence you can very much
evaluate if you like MagicWB or not and if it's worth to register it.  By
installing this version you are also updating to the new MagicWB
color-allocation scheme which makes you compatible with other applications
using MWB.  After this installation no graphics, icons etc.  should appear
in the wrong colors again.  And the icon build-up and general workbench
performance will be much faster than before:

What is MagicWB?

<P>
The definite WB-Enhancer no Amiga can do without.  MagicWB is a full
replacement for the graphic user interface of the Workbench and has become
the standard on the Amiga.  MagicWB 2.x is completely restructured on a new
color-allocation scheme which more than doubles the speed of the WB and
reduces chip-consumption to only a third compared with all previous
versions and also features a highly improved color palette.  MWB 2.x
introduces a never-before-seen standard for over four dozen of new
image-drawers to achieve a more diversified look on your WB.  More icons,
dock-brushes, a dozen of new patterns, fonts and a AA-support complete this
special product.

<P>
Note: If you already are a registered user of MagicWB 2, don't install this
shareware version but read the "About MagicWB" readme first and copy the
udpated MagicWB fonts over your old fonts. That's all.

<P>
The rebirth of the Amiga Games Market has brought about a rebirth of Amiga

It has been decided that Amiga Flame will now continue more than ever with these 
aims, this is not the time to be laxed as their is much we all need to do to keep

<CENTER><H2>Latest From Amiga International</H2></CENTER>
<P>
At the Pianeta Amiga Exhibition on 20/21 September 1997 - Empoli , Italy, Petro 
Tyschtschenko, that the upcoming 3.5 release of AmigaOS will be out around 
February 1998, and Contrary to what <A 
HREF="http://www.cucug.org/amiga/aminews/auoh970924.html">Darrek 
Lisle</A> said at another conference, OS 3.5 will be a software <i>and</i> a 
firmware upgrade (ROMs) and also Amiga International will try to keep the cost as 
low as possible. Also Petro indicated that they still haven't made up their mind on 
which processor will be used in the next generation Amiga, with a possible 
prototype for a new Amiga appearing in late 1998.  Petro said that more would be 
revealed at the Cologne Computer Show.

<CENTER><H2>Aphasia</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Aphasia is another new shoot-em-up which will be coming our way, and being in 
the very early stages of development, the game is set to be released around the 
beginning of 1998 at the earliest.
<P>
There aren't that many details on the game at the moment, except that it will 
contain probably 6 levels which will comprise of a mix of both vertical and 
horizontal scrolling.  A very nice feature of this game, is that the ship will be able 
to transform into a mech, and it will also be able to change aspect depending on 
what weapons are being used.<P>
The game will also boast some special light and water effects, and also 3 different 
languages and in-game speech will also be there.  I haven't be able to get any 
screenshots as yet, but they will appear here as soon as I can get soon.  Finally, a 
demo should be available sometime around Christmas.
