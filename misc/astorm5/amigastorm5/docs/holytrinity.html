Digital Visionaries, programeri koji rade na Holy Trinity, odluèili su objaviti mali info o 
njihovoj igri, tek toliko da se ne misli da ni¹ta ne rade. 
 
Holy Trinity je tek u vrlo ranoj fazi izrade, pa tek rade na likovima.... na slici je njihov 
glavni lik tj. èikica zvana Phoenix. Radna prirèa ide ovako nekako: Phoenix je 
istra¾ivala Garandia ¹umu dok nije nai¹la na Gabriela. Gabriel ju je sluèajno upla¹io 
i pobijegao, no ona ga je opet na¹la i oni su se udru¾ili (!!!!???:))))) u ganjanju "Zla 
broj 1".
  

No, na¾alost, nisu dali ba¹ puno informacija.....Demo se oæekuje jako uskoro.


<b>The Holy Trinity</b> je nova 3D RPG/avantura od strane <b>Digital
Visionariesa</b>. Grafika u igri je raðena po uzoru <b>Mysta</b> samo ¹to u
ovom sluèaju neæe biti &quot;statièna&quot; veæ æe u nekim djelovima biti i
animirana (

It'll feature as said earlier, 3D Myst-like backgrounds with area animation's 
like moving waterfalls, 3D rendered cut-scenes, digitized voice dialogue in 
an evolving storyline that changes based on the player's actions. It is 
interesting to note that Digital Visionaries have stated it will have a Final 
Fantasy VII combat system.



Prièa se temelji na veæ tradicionalnoj borbi izmeðu dobra
i zla, a trebala bi glasiti ovako nekako: prije vi¹e od 1000 godina demoni
su unistili selo Garandia u potrazi

is a 3D rendered adventure/ RPG for the Amiga with 3D rendered 
Myst-like graphics with area animation and Final Fantasy VII combat and menu 
system.

 The Holy Trinity is based on the traditional lines of a war between good 
and evil. It was a thousand years ago when an army of demons destroyed the 
neighboring villages of Garandia in search of a hidden satanic power concealed 
for centuries by a warlock run amok. Many lives were lost at the hands of the 
execution squads deployed by the Evil One, the survivors of these attacks were 
forced to live a horror worse than death: enslavement in the Evil One's army 
of the damned. The Evil One uncovered the Soul Forge, a massive power source 
capable of leveling an entire village in the blink of an eye. 
However, unknown to the Evil One, a chosen one was being born into the world, 
chosen by the High One to vanquish the Evil One and his army of demonic souls. 
You play this Chosen One.

You'll notice by the hand drawn design picture of Phoenix that The Holy Trinity 
is at the initial design stages but it is interesting to see the early beginnings 
of such as game. Phoenix, their newest character is a forest dweller, poor and 
filthy. Phoenix roams Garandia forest until she discovers Gabriel wandering 
through the forest. Gabriel scares her by accident and she runs away. She 
eventually meets up with Gabriel and aids him on his quest to vanquish the 
Evil One.

The Holy Trinity will require an 030 processor, 4MB Fast Ram, is CD-Rom 
only and supports GFX cards for enchanced graphics and resolution. Its 
expected release date is the middle of 1999.
