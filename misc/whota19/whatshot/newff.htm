After another quiet spell on the Forgotten Forever front, I am now able to bring
you some new screenshots of the game, which appears to be getting better all the 
time.<P>

Forgotten Forever, which is due to be published by Sadeness in Summer '98 is a
game that I and many others have been keeping a close eye on.  Ever since it was
initially announced in 1996 there has been growing interest in it.<P>

Most of the screenshots that you can see on this page are in lo-res format,
the game still looks good in this, but nothing compared to the hi-res version. 
I have included one screenshot of this version, so that you'll be able to compare the 
two.<P>

I won't go into game details too much now as that has been done before, but a 
fewthings I will tell you is that it will contain a massive amount of missions set
over 4 different landscapes all in 256 colours.  It will support GFX cards to
the full and is completly OS friendly.<P>

Something that is very interesting is that there is also a screenshot of the
level editor for the game, it looks as though this may be included with the
game.<P>

Like I said expect to see the game released by Sadeness on CD-ROM sometime in
the summer.
