Dear fellow Amigans,

<P> We here at The Lair are proud to announce the release of issue 11,
which is now online, at <A 
HREF="http://www.amigaworld.com/thelair/">http://www.amigaworld.com/thelair/
</A> .

<P>        This month, we have another issue packed with top reviews, articles
and opinions concerning recent developments, releases etc. in the Amiga
community.

<P>        In this issue, we review the amazing new platformer from Team
Invictus, Onescapee, and Vulcan's latest release Final Odyssey. We also
investigate the possible appearance of a fourth commercial web browser for
the Amiga, Project Magic. On the freeware side of the software market, we
look at the impact the release of the Doom source code has had, plus we
review all the latest features the Amiga Doom clones have to offer. Our poll
this month wants your views on AAG and HTML, while the results of last
month's heated custom/off-the-shelf poll are also in.

<P>        In short, we have another great issue for everyone to read this
month- as always, absolutely no subscription is necessary.

<P>        Best wishes to you all,

<P>Chris Hanretty, aka Obscure Reference, Editor
