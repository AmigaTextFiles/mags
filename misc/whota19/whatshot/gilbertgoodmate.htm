Gilbert Goodmate and the Mushroom of Phungoria has been under development 
for well over a year by Prelusion and this is a very early demo just to show you the 
type of graphics, gameplay and ideas they are putting into this game.

It is an adventure game which follows a brave hero whose grandfather is under 
threat of execution after the gigantic mushroom was stolen.  He is blamed for it 
being stolen as he was suppose to guard it. Now it is up to Gilbert to find the 
stolen mushroom before the end of the week or his grandfather will be executed.  
This is just to give you a brief idea of the storyline.

The demo contains two screens, one is part of a village where you can talk to 
Louise for the latest gossip or Blind Sam and his dog.  The second screen is where 
you can go into one of the houses to meet Elton the Alchemist.  You are able to 
look at or talk to things such as people or objects, read, open doors, pick stuff up 
like going into Elton's fridge and taking his Old Dragon chili sauce.  Try switching 
on the machine and watch what happens.

Gilbert Goodmate has been nicely designed with good character animations and on 
screen animations - I'm looking forward to seeing the next demo.  It's expected to 
be released sometime in the Autumn with it containing full digitised speech and 
will be CD-ROM only.
