<P>
New Generation Software of Germany has authorized <A 
HREF="http://nrex.net/dimensions/">Dimensions Computers</a>
of the USA to distribute and promote their "Oxypatcher" software.
Oxypatcher is a program to enhance the performance of any Amiga using
an 040 or 060 processor.  The Oxyron Patcher handles calls to the
processor's FPU (68882 math co-processor), which the native OS library
system does quite poorly, resulting in a performance increase of up to
20 times when using New Generation's product.  Oxypatcher is currently
the only software package available for all 040/060 users, except those
with Phase5 accelerators, who have Cyberpatcher, which only works in
conjunction with a Phase5 accelerator card.  In virtually all cases,
Oxypatcher is equal to or faster than even Cyberpatcher.  More
information on the Oxyron patcher is available in German and English at:

<P>It is thus sincerely recommended that all owners of QuikPak,
ACT Apollo, GVP/GVP-M, and A3640 boards, including all 68040 A4000 and
A4000T computers, as well as 4000T/060 models look into the Oxyron
Patcher.  This software package can provide you with an inexpensive
yet major performance increase.
