</H2></CENTER>
<P>
I'm sure many of you have heard about this game.  You have probably noticed that
things have been rather quiet regarding it recently.  Well, there hasn't been a
lot done on it due to problems encountered by the team, however, the 
programmers
are hoping work can continue on the project - with your help.  Below is a
press release from the team, read carefully and if you are at all interested
don't hesitate to contact them at one of the addresses at the end:-<P>

<UL><I>
<B>ALMAGICA<br>
Scions Of A Forgotten World</B>
<p>
We, the creators of Almagica are looking for new programmers to join the project.
<p>
This document describes, not single persons, but rather areas of programming
objectives  that need to be filled. All code should as far as possible be 
written in portable C, but may in some cases be optimized in 68k asm. The 68k
asm routines should however, never be made without a fallback routine in C. All
code must be system friendy.<p>

<B>Introduction To The Game</B><P>

Almagica is a realtime strategy game that takes place in a fantasy environment.
The game is devided into two parts, the action part which can be compared to
games such as Warcraft II. What is somewhat unique in the Almagica concept
however, is that the levels are not played in sequence. The game rather follows
a storyline which changes as the game goes on. These changes are based partly on
the outcome of an action level, but also in the second part of the game (for the
moment called the 'scene part'). In the scene part the player can choose from a
number of different available actions, making the actual gameplay very
varying.<P>


<B>AI-Sub system</B><br>
<ul>
Responsible for developing the AI, things like orders, enemy moves, pathfinders.
<p>
<LI>Pathfinder</LI><br>
<LI>Order-Scripting, how a unit should execute an order</LI><br>
<LI>Event-selection for computerized players. </LI><br>
<LI>Interface the AI with TCP/IP communication for multiplayer game. 
</LI><br>
</ul>

<P>

<B>Communication-Sub system</B><br>
<ul>
Responsible for creating an interface between 2 or more computers, with the aim at 
TCP/IP but possibly also Serial/Parallell communication.
<p>
<LI>Design a communication protocol, including data sent from the AI and other
network only communication such as broken connections etc.</LI> <br>

<LI>Write low level communication source, primary for TCP/IP but also possibly
for Serial and/or parallell communication. (Lowlevel routines for TCP/IP exists
in the RTGmaster.library!). </LI>
</ul><P>

<B>GFX Sub system</B><br>
<ul>
Responsible for programming the graphical interface and everything concerning the 
on-screen graphics, such as animations.
<p>

<LI>Provide the graphics interface between the user and the game and the
TCP/IP.</LI>
<br>
<LI>Write code to display gfx, by using the RTGMaster.library,
including everything concerning the gfx (animations, units, terrain, etc).</LI>
<br>

</ul>
<P>
<B>Music/Sfx-Sub system</B><BR>
<ul>
<LI>Responsible for making the sound interface between the game and AHI. 
Should
write/translate a DBM0-player in portable C.</LI>

<LI>Determine and select a format to use for music and write a player.</LI> 
<br>
<LI>Write code to play soundeffects. </LI><br>
<LI>Provide and interface for the gfx-programming to start soundeffects.
</LI>
</ul> <P>

<B>Main system</B><br>
<ul>
Responsible for creating all the internal structures of the game and linking all the 
above sources into one executable.
<p>
<LI>Construct and setup internal structures such as objects, maps, gameplay etc,
partly based on what's needed for linking etc, and partly based to the demands
from the subsystems. </LI><br>

<LI>Use the interfaces provided by the subsystems to create the final
executable.</LI> <br>

<LI>Provide an interface for the subsystems to do system allocations (files,
memory etc), and design that system so that there always is a safe way out.</LI>
<br>

<LI>See to that all parts follow the guidelines for the multilingual capabilites
as wanted by the Vulcan locale standards.</LI> <br>

</ul>
