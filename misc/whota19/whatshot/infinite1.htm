Update</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Following the previous news release from Infinite Frontiers regarding our new 
Amiga
magazine, <i>Amiga Energy</i>, here is the latest run-down on what is 
happening with this new
fan-produced, non-profit making publication.

<P><b><i>Amiga Energy</i> - The Team</b>

<P><i>Amiga Energy</i> is being developed by a core team of writers from 
Amiga licenceware team,
Infinite Frontiers, consisting of: Sven Harvey - Editor, Writer, Publicity Simon 
Plumbe
- Editor, Writer, Coverdisk Compiler, Subscriptions Colin Gunn - Writer, Executive
Producer

<P>In terms of experience, Sven has worked in the computer retail trade for over 
7 years,
primarily trying to sell Amigas to an unsuspecting public! As well as this, Sven 
worked
on the Amiga CD-ROM "CD Gold" which was the Amiga's first (and only) CD-based 
magazine
as a writer and artist. Colin has also worked in the retail trade for most of his
working life, and has worked professionally as a writer working on science fiction
titles, most notably for the Official Star Trek Fan Club Of The UK. Finally, Simon
acted as Editor on the CD GOLD project, which he also wrote for extensively, and 
has
spent endless hours in front of the keyboard in his secondary career as a freelance
writer working on a variety of titles including Amiga Pro, Amiga User International,
and was the regular Amiga columnist for Micromart.

<P>All three of the team have been actively involved in all of the releases from 
Infinite
Frontiers, which is run by Simon and Colin.

<P><b><i>Amiga Energy</i> - What's New</b>

<P>We have now settled on the size, page count and prices of the magazine, and 
following
the response we had to our first phase of online promotion we are well under way 
to
releasing the first issue shortly.

<P>There has been some confusion arising from our previous posting regarding 
the magazine.
<i>Amiga Energy</i> is solely about the Amiga, it's hardware, software, and 
most importantly,
it's users. While most of Infinite Frontiers' work in the past has been in the field of
science fiction, the <i>Amiga Energy</i> team has had more than it's share of 
Amiga
experience.

<P>Also, we would like to stress that the magazine is NOT a commercial 
publication - it is
a magazine by Amiga enthusiasts who share a love of the Amiga that we're sure all 
of
you reading this do. We are taking advertising (to help pay for the magazine), but 
all
of the money taken from the asking price goes back into producing the magazine.

<P><b>Coming In Issue One</b>

<P>All of the regular features you'd expect to find in any Amiga magazine - 
software
reviews (games, serious, PD/shareware etc.), hardware reviews, free readers adverts 
(up
to 30 words - e-mail or post them to us now for inclusion in Issue One!!), technical
advice, letters, games tips, and more. Also, we'll be featuring our own ongoing 
series'
including a look at all of the Amiga models released taking an in-depth analysis of
each, a look at classic Amiga games of old that many users may have overlooked,
tutorials (planned for future issues - let us know what you want us to cover), plus
plenty of one-off articles and features.

<P>Normally, each issue will also come complete with an optional coverdisk 
crammed full of
software. However, for issue one we have a two-disk special featuring our 3D 
rendered
Star Trek slideshow "Holodeck 10" featuring incredible artwork from Paul Coleman.
Through the licenceware distribution scheme, this two-disk set has sold previously 
for
£3.00 and is yours for just an extra £0.50!! If things do well with the sales of the
magazine, in future we'd like to bring you even more spectacular coverdisks and 
full
programs.

<P>Issue one is due for release in early March 1998, spanning a total of 48 A5 
pages, and
TWO coverdisks (the slideshow mentioned above). Future issues will initially be
released approximately every two months, although this may be increased as the 
magazine
grows in popularity.

<P><b>Ordering Details</b>

<P>We are now taking pre-orders for the first issue (along with subscription 
orders) and
these will be despatched once the magazine is released. Unlike many magazines, for
those of you ordering from outside of the UK, we will still send out coverdisks!! To
order, send a cheque, postal order, cash (sent at your own risk) or an IMO payable 
to
"Infinite Frontiers" to the address at the foot of this news update.

<P>The price for the magazine for those of you in the UK is £1.80 (£1.50 plus 
£0.30
postage) for the standard edition, and £2.30 (£2.00 plus £0.30 postage) for the
coverdisk version. For overseas readers, the prices are £2.00 for the standard 
version
and £2.50 for the disk version.

<P>However, should you wish to take out a six-issue subscription to save money, 
and to
ensure that the magazines are sent to you as soon as they are released you can take
advantage of these great offers: for a six issue UK subscription you pay just £10 for
the normal edition, or £12.50 for the disk version. For overseas readers, the price is
just £11 for the standard edition and £14 for the disk edition. In addition to saving
money, all subscribers can choose a free 2-disk slideshow from our range of Amiga
licenceware disks - either the Star Trek slideshow "Holodeck 9" or the general
slideshow "Illusions 5" worth £3.00 each!!
