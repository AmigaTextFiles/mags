Friends, have you been hearing those cries of, "The end is near? The end

is near!" on the Internet and in your favorite Amiga magazine?  We've

heard them too, but with a difference!  You see, what we're hearing is

that the end of the 'bad old days' is here and the Amiga has a bright

future ahead of it!<BR><BR>



Now, we're not going to say this will be easy and it certainly won't

happen overnight. There are many things that need to be done. Not all of

these things are obvious and few of them are what you would call high

visibility changes.  What we've got to do is dig the cellar again and

rebuild the foundations of the Amiga and the Amiga market.<BR><BR>



You should already be seeing the results of this.  For example:<BR><BR>



There are over a dozen licensees of the Amiga making Amigas and Amiga

clones.  New models with new features have already shipped.  In the

coming months you'll be seeing a lot more about these machines and

you'll learn about companies with names like <I>DCE, Index Information

Systems, Micronik, Quick Pak, Nova Sector</I>.  You'll be able to buy Amigas

that are faster, and more powerful, than ever before.  As more of these

machines get in the hands of the writers and editors out there, you'll

find out about them.<BR><BR>



The Amiga games market is growing and taking control! Commodore

determined the base configuration a game maker could count on for his

audience.  Now games like <I>Myst, The Shadow of the Third Moon, Quake</I> 
and

others require CDROM, hard drives, and 4 megs or more of RAM.  And guess

what? The games are selling faster than ever because if a user didn't

already have these features in their Amiga, they're getting their

Amiga's upgraded!<BR><BR>



New software applications are coming out and old applications are

getting upgraded.  You can get <I>Aladdin 4D 5.0, Tornado 3D 1.0, Electric

Dreams, Wildfire, Directory Opus Magellan, ImageFX 3.0</I> and many, MANY,

more titles.<BR><BR>  



The Amiga trade shows are getting bigger and better than ever.  Last

year the <I>Midwest Amiga Expo, St. Louis' Amiga '97</I> and Koln's 
<I>Computer

'97</I> set new attendance records for both Amiga dealer/company

participation and for user attendance as well! This year we are looking

forward to <I>St. Louis' Amiga '98, International Amiga '98</I> in Toronto,

Canada, <I>AmiWest</I> in Sacramento, the <I>1998 Midwest Amiga 
Expo</I> (which

promises to be twice as big yet again!), and shows again in the UK and

Germany as well.<BR><BR>



Things aren't just happening within the Amiga community, no sir! Wired

magazine and several news services have run stories about the Amiga

revival. Mainstream computer magazines have been referring to 1998 as

the year that alternative computer platforms, like the Amiga, will be

gaining market share again. Amigas are still used in mission critical

applications where reliability and integration has been the key.  The

Amiga goes to war in the <I>M1 Abrams tank</I>, up into space with the 
<I>Space

Shuttle</I> and down to the ocean floor to help explore the wreck of the

<I>Titanic</I> for James Cameron's film. Of course, nearly everyone's local

television and cable station still has several Amigas in house for video

work if you want something a bit closer to home!<BR><BR>



You're going to be seeing a lot more of our work take form over this

year. More new "Powered by Amiga" based machines.  An upgraded AmigaOS. 

Coordinated developer resources and user group resources.<BR><BR> 



1998 is going to be a fun ride!<BR><BR>
