align=right>CounterStrike which has joined the ever growing list of C&C clones 
currently in development for the Amiga, was previously mentioned in the News In 
Brief Section around October last year, with a limited demo version appearing on 
the Aminet, round about the same time.

align=right>Details are low as it is still in the early stages of development, but 
from I've heard it will have very detailed maps with plenty of animation and full 
speech.  There will be tonnes of different units and buildings with the buildings 
changing in look for each world.  Each team will also have there own unique 
buildings and units, so you don't get the usual blue and red as seen in other 
games. 
<br>
<br>
It'll feature TCP/IP support for playing it over the Internet and support 
CybergraphX.  The full version will also include special HiRes graphics, 040/060 
optimized routines and will be CD-ROM only.
