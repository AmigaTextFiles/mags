<B>WANTED: Dialogue writer for Gilbert Goodmate</B><P>

We at Prelusion are currently producing an adventure game for the Amiga
called Gilbert Goodmate and the Mushroom of Phungoria. The game will be
published by Alive Mediasoft Ltd. We are looking for someone to help us
write character dialogues. You would get a very central position in the 
creation of character conversations.<P>


<B>Information about the game</B><P>

Gilbert Goodmate is quite similar in style to the Monkey Island games.
The original story line is very humorous and entertaining. More information
about the story can be found on our website at: http://pln.home.ml.org
We have recently released a small playable demo of GG. You might be
interested to try it in order to get an impression of the style of the game. It
can be found on our site as well. If you have troubles connecting please visit
AmigaFlame at: http://www.amigaflame.co.uk/amidem22.htm They have a list of
servers where the demo can be found.<P>

<B>Requirements</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>You should be very familiar with adventure games, i.e. you should have
  played lots of games in the genre and have a good understanding of how
  they are structured. It's an additional advantage if you have played
  recent titles on other platforms as well, such as the PC. </LI>

  and a also be a good writer.</LI>

</UL><P>


<B>What you will do</B><P>

Your work will be structured in the following way:
First we'll send you detailed information about all the in-game characters
and the storyline of the game.
For each dialogue you are to write, we'll give you some brief information.
Most importantly what the conversation is supposed to "lead to".
It's then your task to write a good dialogue. You get very free hands in
this process. As long as the text is entertaining, appropriate, and leads
to the correct event, you are free to write practically whatever you want.<P>


<B>Contact us</B><P>

If you are interested, don't hesitate to contact us. We will then ask you
to write a sample dialogue in order to see if your writing is suitable for
this project. We will also supply you with other necessary information, such
as payment, deadline, etc.<P>

Please state where you live, your age and any experience you might have.<P>

We look forward to hear from you!<P>
