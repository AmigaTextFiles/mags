<P><B>Oberursel, 2/5/98:</B></P>

<P>Good news for all users of the Amiga 1200 which are looking forward to
upgrade their computer to PowerPC performance: The BLIZZARD 603e Power Board
finally went into production by end of January, and will start shipping
in the second half of February. The finalization of this product, which
has been presented to the public already in November 1997 on the Amiga Show
in Cologne, had been delayed by some small but tricky design problems that
are now solved. Amiga 1200 users can now go for real Power(PC)horses for
their machines, too.</P>

<P>phase 5 digital products has changed the product line and the nomenclature
of the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board, which will be available in speeds of 160,
200 and 250 MHz. Three major changes should be recognized by all 
customers:</P>

<P>1. There will be no more 030 version coming out (formerly named BLIZZARD
603e), only the 040/060 version will become available (formerly known as
BLIZZARD 603e+).</P>

<P>2. The '+' sign remains and indicates that the board is equipped with
a SCSI controller, while the standard BLIZZARD 603e comes without SCSI;
this decision has been made to offer a lower-cost entry product. The SCSI
controller can not be upgraded later, however; this is a compromise due
to the design requirements.</P>

<P>3. The BLIZZARD 603e and 603e+ boards will ship either with a 68LC040-25
(w/o FPU), a 68040-25 (w/ FPU) or a 68060.</P>

<P>The new product line looks as follows, with a recommended retail pricing
in UK Pounds and US Dollar as follows (prices for the UK incude VAT):<BR>

<P>phase 5 digital products has put a marketing focus on the low-end boards
with inexpensive 040's and the 160 or 200 MHz PowerPC CPU. &quot;These entry-
level
products will provide the best price-performance relation, and offer a substantial
performance and functionality increase for A1200 users for a reasonable
investment&quot; says Wolf Dietrich of phase 5. &quot;Therefore we will
start to ship the 160 MHz versions first, and later the 200 and 250 MHz
versions, as we currently have some 9-10 weeks delivery lead time on the
faster PowerPC chips.&quot; The BLIZZARD 603e Power Board comes along with
a complete software demo package, including e.g. a MPEG player that allows
for MPEG playback in small resolutions even on the Amiga's AGA standard
graphics, and other interesting software. </P>

<P>phase 5 digital products will offer special upgrade conditions for users
of a BLIZZARD 1240 T/ERC or a BLIZZARD 1260 Turbo Board; the upgrade offer
will be published on phase 5's website in February, and will also be mailed
to registered users during February. Also available on phase 5's website
will be a purchase information for users of 68040/68060 boards from other
vendors, who want to obtain a BLIZZARD 603e Power Board.</P>

<P>Users of BLIZZARD 1230-IV boards, which had been looking forward to a
68030-based PowerUP board as an upgrade, will also get special upgrade 
conditions
for the 68040-based BLIZZARD 603e Power Boards. The upgrade offer will be
published on phase 5's website in February, and will also be mailed to registered
users within during February. Users who have no access to the internet or
don't get an upgrade mailing can also contact their local distributor or
dealer for the upgrade conditions.</P>

<P><B>BLIZZARD 603e and BLIZZARD 603e+ Power Boards pass CE 
approval</B></P>

<P>The BLIZZARD 603e and BLIZZARD 603e+ Power Boards, installed into a 
standard
Amiga 1200 desktop system, have passed the CE approval for Class A devices
in compliance with the EN55022 standard; this means that both products can
be used in standard Amiga 1200 desktops under the condition that the user
undertakes necessary actions in case that e.g. radio or television reception
in the near surrounding gets disturbed. Such necessary actions would be
the use of a shielded case, such as a common tower case for the Amiga 1200,
in which the combination of the Amiga 1200 motherboard and the BLIZZARD
603e and BLIZZARD 603e+ Power Boards fully complies to the EN55022 Class
B standard. phase 5 digital products points out that the use of the BLIZZARD
603e or BLIZZARD 603e+ Power Board in a desktop Amiga 1200 may also require
the usage of a replacement power supply, which are usually provided with
tower cases.
