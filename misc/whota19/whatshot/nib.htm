Welcome to the News In Brief Section.  This page contains all articles from 1st - 
15th February.  Enjoy.

<CENTER><H2>Sega Rally Clone In The Making</H2></CENTER>
<P>
You may remember that Darkage Software's first title Alive was covered in a 
previous article, and at that time I said that you would get info on their second 
game which is going to be a Sega Rally type game, now I have obtained the 
following details.
<br>
<br>
At present it has no name but it'll have features such as various environments, 
textures and gouraud algorithms including images such as tunnels, mountains, 
animated backgrounds and so on.  They are working at the moment on the IQ of 
the cars along with proper collisions between cars.
<br>
<br>
It will be CD-ROM only, requiring 4MB Fast Ram - in 1x1 320x256 it does 17/25fps 
on an 030/50mhz which is not bad.
<P>
<CENTER><H2>BlitzBombers Available</H2></CENTER>
<p>
Yep, thats right, it's finally available.  After years of waiting you can
finally get your hands on probably the best bomberman game ever.  However,
the best thing is yet to come, it's FREE!<P>

The game was pretty much finished way back in January of 1996, however, another
company then threatened Red When Excited with legal action if they released the
game, saying it was too similar to their product and it would give the
impression it WAS one of their products.<P>

Now, 2 years later they have decided to release it AS-IS to the Amiga public for
free.<P>

The archive is currently available from the Red When Excited site and Aminet, to
download click on the relevent link below:-<P>

<CENTER><H2>ZhaDoom</H2></CENTER>
<P>
ZhaDoom has been made by Steffen P. Haeuser and is a PPC version which has 
been compiled using H&Ps WarpOS Software.  It's available at the Aminet and it's 
just been updated with it now supporting mouse, joysticks and joypads.  A 68K 
version is also included in the archive but it's said to be slow.
<br>
<br>
There are many Amiga Doom's around, but for anyone who has a PPC board they 
should definitely try this out.
<p>
<CENTER><H2>Latest Amiga RC5 Team Effort News</H2></CENTER>
<p>
The DES capable Amiga client has finally arrived!  At the moment, the Amiga RC5 
Team is currently at 15th position, but now that this new client is ready, they 
should now be able to get back into the top ten, so download this client as soon as 
possible.  A much faster DES core is under development (RC5-64 core same as 
before) and a PPC client is under development too, stay tuned.

<CENTER><H2>CUCUG Web Server Back Online</H2></CENTER>
<p>
February 10, 1998 - <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/">CUCUG</a> is
pleased to announce that the recent problems with the reliability of
our main web server have been solved for now.

<P>The main CUCUG web site in Champaign, IL went down on Thursday,
February 5th due to a problem with a bad power supply. The current
server which houses the CUCUG site had been in use for less than two
weeks when it went down. This new server is about three times as
powerful as our former machine and will allow us to handle the
enormous amount of daily web traffic much better than the former machine.

<P>Everything seems to be working properly and is back to normal.

<P>Thanks to everyone who wrote us with their concerns and offers of
assistance! A special thanks to <A
HREF="http://www.nationalamiga.com/">National Amiga</a> for allowing
us to use their e-mail list announcing the status of the problem.

<P>-Kevin Hisel<br>
 CUCUG Webmaster

Since the last version that was released the engine has been totally recoded. 
It now has new features such as gouroud shading on top of texture mapping and
translecent gouraud shading used for the engine lights.<P>

as I have it.

<p>
Orion Wars is a new Elite/Wing Commander like game that is currently being
developed.  Details are quite low at the moment, however, I can bring you
details on the engine used and a sneak preview screenshot.<P>

The game will be using an engine called elite motor, at first glance it looks
very similar to the Lambda engine, however, this is at a later stage of
development.<P>

The engine boasts many features, it supports texture mapping, gouraud shading,
effects such as lens flare, reflections, debris and much more.  The author is
planning to implement support for AGA, CyberGFX and Picasso.<P>

There will hopefully be some sort of preview available soon, as soon as I
receive any more details, I will tell you.
