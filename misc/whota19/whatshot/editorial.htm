Hi,
<p>
After the last issue, things seem to have quietened down after the multitude of big 
announcements for Amiga International to name just one, but there are still a 
couple of articles from Amiga International.  This issue's editorial and this issue of 
What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine, concentrates on Vulcan Software, who are 
currently the oldest Amiga software house out there, and there are no less than 
three articles on them in this issue, but also there is an update to the PowerUp 
Latest article from the last issue, which will definitely be of interest to A1200 
owners, with the announcement that the Blizzard PPC 603e accelerator cards have 
finally gone into production.  After several issues in row, there is no formal article 
on Foundation in this issue there's none whatsoever, but I've heard it could be at 
least April before it's released, and as usual there is some more news on the 
Amiga RC5 Team Effort, and the last I heard they are currently at 14th position.  
Also, anyone who is a regular visitor to the Amiga Web Directory, that the main 
site was down from Thursday 5th to Tuesday 10th February, well to find out the 
reason behind this, check out this issue's <A HREF="nib.htm"> News In Brief</A>.
<p>
Well, you might be wondering where the new survey is?  It will be turning up in 
time for the next issue, as just before I finished this editorial, I came into possession 
of some interesting bits and pieces that I hope to put into the survey.
<p>
On the games front, there are plenty of articles, but the two biggest of the whole 
lot have to be the <A HREF="newff.htm">New Forgotten Forever 
Screenshots</A> & <A HREF="quakepics.htm">Quake Pics</A> articles, along 
with the <A HREF="nib.htm"> New Lambda Screenshots and Orion Wars</A> 
articles in this issue's <A HREF="nib.htm">News In Brief</A> will also be of 
great interest to those for you who liked Elite and Wing Commander.
<p>
To continue on with the mentioning of the JavaScript abilities of AWeb 3.1 in the 
last issue, currently there are only two Amiga related web sites out there that using 
JavaScript and they are the <A HREF="http://www.cu-amiga.co.uk">CU Amiga 
Magazine</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.amiga.u-
net.com/BuiltWithAmiga/home.html">Built With Amiga</A> web sites.  As soon 
as more Amiga web browsers gain JavaScript capabilities, more Amiga web sites will 
undoubtedly use it, stay tuned here to find out which Amiga web sites are 
JavaScript when they turn up.  But, continuing on the subject on web browsers, I 
heard that within hours of the announcement from Netscape, saying that they were 
making the source code to Netscape freely available, at least one Amiga 
programmer was interested in doing the job, but unfortunately it will not give us 
access to the various plugins as yet, but it is hoped that the companies that hold 
these plugins, will make their source codes freely available as well.
<p>
This issue's exclusive articles are on <A HREF="poweruplatest1.htm">PowerUP 
Latest</A> and <A HREF="quakepics.htm">Quake Pics</A>.
<p>
What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine can still be found on the web, at: <p> <A 
HREF="http://www.sonic.net/~alanwall/whota/index.html">http://www.sonic.net/~al
anwall/whota/index.html</A>. 
<p>
Now this month's, Site Of The Month is <A 
HREF="http://www.nutts.demon.co.uk/">The Amiga 
Nutta</A>, which has been mentioned in a number of previous articles 
in What's Hot.  The site is well worth a look to keep up with all the latest Amiga 
games news along with release schedules for all upcoming Amiga games amongst 
other games related stuff.  
<P>
The Links section has been cleaned up and so check out <A 
HREF="links.htm">Links</A> for the latest additions to my Links Section.
