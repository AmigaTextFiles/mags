Trapped 3, which is otherwise known as 'fratzengeballer' is a completely
different to previous Trapped games.  Gone is the magic that was found in
earlier games and in is more of a kill everything style of game.<P>

Improvements on Trapped 2 include more enemies, more weapons, improved 
grahical
effects such as smoke, translucency, dithering, realtime rotatable may and much
more.  One thing that is surprising is the system requirements, all you'll
need is a 020 with 1Mb Chip, 4Mb Fast RAM and a CD-ROM drive.<P>
