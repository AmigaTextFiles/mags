  - Ellipsegment wireframe problems fixed (Lathe tool sometimes produced
    invalid wireframes, which could not be recreated after reloading)
  - Invisible compound objects are invisible in modifications also after
    saving and reloading.
  - The font curve extractor creates only spline curves Previously some 
    characters of certain fonts produced polygonal outlines that could
    not be extruded (Windows version)

- Advanced Systems & Software, AS&S, Germany, the maker of CyberVision and
  CyberStorm 68060 for the Amiga is currently developing 2-GO!, an all new
  DSP-Board for the Amiga.
  The Zorro-III DSP Board allows you to greatly speed up your Amiga. MPEG/
  JPEG coding and decoding is possible in real time. 
  The 2-GO! processors are freely programmable, so one could use it as a
  render engine, port OpenGL to it, do audio processing etc.
  The hardware consists of a very fast Zorro-III interface (up to 34MB/sec)
  , 64 bit DSP memory, a 64bit port to the CyberVision64 graphics board and
  audio/video in & output.
  The board is powered by a DSP (max.  2 billion instructions/sec), a 
  master RISC CPU (50 MIPS) and a floating point unit (100 MIPS). This is
  enough number crunching power for MPEG/JPEG de-/encoding, or for 
  rendering 750.000 gourard shaded polygons/sec to the Cybervision.
  The software is planned to include a MPEG/JPEG tool, interfaces to 3D
  renderes and image processors and libraries for you project developement.
  The 2-GO!  should be released during the second half of 1995, at a 
  projected price of $2600 US.

- Ralph Schmidt annouces the release of CyberGuard mainly for the 
  Cyberstorm 060. Cyberguard has the same functionality as Enforcer
  V37 (by M.Sinz) with the enhancements of a build in a disassembler
  and a GuardianAngel mode. GuardianAngel mode means that it can 
  writeprotect free memory pages to detect random write bugs that are
  rather difficult to find.
  So programmers won't miss their most used debug tool, Enforcer, when they
  develop 68060 applications. CyberGuard is uploaded to AmiNet.

  ProVector version 3.0 features among others:
  - OS 2.04+ only but will take advantage of WB2.1 and WB3 features
  - AGA support
  - Good looking, easy to use, and much improved 3D user-interface with
    2.04+ look and feel
  - Using the ASL standard requesters and other standard bits
  - Improved tool control
  - Gradient fills
  - Object shearing & warping
  - Object blending (morphing from one object to another)
  - Improved text support
  - LightWave file exporting
  - Export Adobe Illustrator (all versions)
  - StylusTrace, a dedicated high quality auto-tracing program (converts
    bitmapped images into structured drawings) much better (faster, more
    accurate, more features) than the autotracing used by other programs
    on Mac/Amiga/IBM/Unix.
  - Extensive online help system using standard AmigaGuide
  - Support for all knwon Amiga graphic boards/accelerators
  - Stylus has worked close with SOFT-LOGIK to make the all new ProVector
    a good completation for PageStream 3.0, the king of DTP programs.

  for newcommers to vector based drawing softwares and ProVector, version
  2.1 of this excellent program features:

  - ProVector has a very complete and exellent Arexx interface and is fully
    programmable and extendable through Arexx As complete as you could want.
    You can do anything via ARexx that you can via the interface, and more.
    You can manipulate ProVector's internal data structures fairly directly
    , create your own custom object types (a physicist customer has created
    Feynman diagram objects, for example), create your own custom object 
    operations, etc. This in one of the most configurable Amiga software,
    since it has a very full featured ARexx implementation for user 
    customization and communication with other programs. The package 
    includes many useful ready-made ARexx macros.
  - ProVector comes with 2 HP-GL driver which can be and has been used to
    drive various sign cutting engines (vinyl cutting) like most Roland
    plotter. The IFF-DR2D format is directly supported by many curring 
    devices like Sign Engine. In addition to the tiling HP-GL driver, 
    another feature of ProVector that sign-cutters have found very useful
    is the floating point math version of ProVector. Tiling of large pages
    to multiple output pages allows you to make VERY large signs, page
    sizes, like 15 miles x 15 miles :-)
  - The input/output formats are Encapsulated PostScript (true PostScript
    editing), EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) created on all the personal and
    workstation computer platforms, IFF-ILBM (including 24-bit, ANTI-
    ALIASED ILBM), HP-GL, Illustrator/EPSF, Multiple Layers support for
    IFF-DR2D (Amiga standard format for structured drawing developed openly
    and in cooperation with the Amiga community by Stylus). It can also 
    print to any Preferences-supported printer.
    The postscript handling in ProVector is remarkable. It can save PS or
    EPS to PAR: SER: or a file.
    ProVector can be used for drawings to include in LaTeX documents and it
    works great. Specially because it provides the drawing with a correct
    BoundingBox (one that adjusts to the drawing) so dvips can position the
    figure correctly.
    That kind of data import capability is really useful when integrating
    the Amiga into today's work environment, an environment filled with a
    variety of computers running a wide spectrum of software.
  - Very fast freehand drawing tool
  - Very flexible spline tool
  - Other tools for boxes, ovals, polygonal shapes, fill control, line 
    control, text, etc.
  - Multiple projects open on-screen at one time. Multiple drawings are 
    open in separate windows and cut and paste between them is supported
  - Cut-and-paste to the Amiga clipboard
  - 255-level Undo
  - One of the fastest Amiga program, optimized for speed even on slower 
    Amigas. It uses less memory than any other vectorbased graphic package.
  - Text effects
  - Three version of the program for integer, floating point and 68020
    and up processors)
  - ProVector uses amiga multitasking enviroment very effectively. For
    example, when redrawing a screen you can go ahead and select your next
    operation and the redrawing will be aborted.
  - It support 8 bit (256 color) per drawing out of 16 million colors via
    dithering. You can create custom fill patterns from any object.
  - It can rotate objets, text and also will "flow" text around any 
    outline. You can rotate about any point you desire, as well as rotate
    with clone, rotate by fixed increment, etc.
  - It has Splines curves Bezier cubic splines. It also can interpolate
    curves from a polygon.  It also supports elliptical arcs.
  - ProVector comes with a utility to convert PostScript Type 1 fonts to
    ProVector format, so you have quite a variety of fonts to choose from.

  AmyNews sidenote:
  We work with ProVector as well as many other structured drawing programs
  for many different platforms and we wish to mention that ProVector,
  assumimg that you can use it's exellent Arexx interface, is the fastest
  and most powerful structured drawing programs on any platfrom. We would
  like to rate the softwares that we use as follows:

  - ProVector, Amiga
  - Aldus Freehand, Mac
  - Adobe Illustrator, PC
  - Corel Draw, PC
  - MicroGraphx Designer, PC
  - Art Expression, Amiga

  If you need something for your technical drawings, something that can
  deal with EPS clipart created on any platform, something that will let
  you create your own using sophisticated structured drawing tools,
  something that will work with your other programs like Pagestream and
  FinalWriter, and that is actively supported and developed for the Amiga,
  you ought to look at ProVector. 
  Stylus has been selling and supporting ProVector for years and is 
  actively supporting and improving this software, and provids an excellent
  solution to people who need to work with structured drawing for things
  like video graphics, desktop publishing, technical drawings, and sign
  making.

- The very long awaited SAS C Amiga Developement package version 6.55 is
  now finally released. This patch may be found in AmiNet. The new version
  features (summary):

  - SE will now optionally display a C file in multiple colors for the
    different token types. You can select the foreground, background,
    and style (bold, italic, underline or normal) for each of the
    following nine catagories: Plain Text, C Comments, C++ Comments,
    Double quoted strings, Single quoted strings, Numerical constants,
    Keywords, Identifiers, and Preprocessor Statements. There are two
    new menu items to control this in the Configuration Window.
    Colorize C Files -  when set will cause all new files opened that
    end in .c* or .h to be colorized. Changing this will not effect
    any windows currently open in SE.
    Colorize C Prefs - will bring up another window and allow you to
    change the display attributes for any of the nine catagories.
  - A new profiler has been added that works like the SPROF profiler, but
    provides a graphical user interface to the profiling process.
  - Example code is provided in SC:EXAMPLES/AMIPROC that forks a
    subprocess with its own near data section.  This will allow you to
    share code between processes but still use external data in each
    subprocess.
  - Example code is provided in SC:EXAMPLES/MOUNT that mounts and
    dismounts a file system node on the system list WITHOUT using the
    AmigaDOS Mount command.  This will allow you to code a file system
    as a regular C program, invokable from command line or workbench.
    Since it's a regular process, it will be able to use printf() or
    other library I/O and be easily debuggable with CPR in any usual
    fashion.
  - Three new messages have been added to the C compiler: 188, 189,
    and 113.
  - Built-in preprocessor symbols (like _SHORTINT, _UNSCHAR, etc.)
    were not added to the GST in previous versions.  In 6.55, they
    are added.
  - The built-in memcpy function can copy certain structures more
    efficiently now since the compiler retains more information on
    the alignment requirements of the structures.  This also
    benefits structure assignment and call-by-value.
  - The layout of bitfields was inadvertently changed between 6.0 and
    6.50, which meant that structures containing bitfields were
    incompatible between the two versions.  Bitfields now use
    the 6.0 method, with the exception of bitfields of size :0.
    :0 bitfields exhibited a bug in 6.0-6.3 and added extra unusable
    bytes to the structure.  6.55 bitfields do not add these extra
    bytes.  Note that the bitfields in 6.51 and 6.55 are identical;
    this change only affects users upgrading from 6.50.
  - The compiler now defines a preprocessor symbol __AMIGADATE__.
    This preprocessor symbol resolves to a datestamp string in the
    format required for the AmigaDOS VERSION command.  The format is
    "(dd.mm.yy)", where dd is the day (1-31), mm is the month (1-12),
    and yy is the year. __AMIGADATE__ is available from both C
    and C++.  Version 6.51 had some bugs in the __AMIGADATE__
    processing which have been fixed for this patch release.
  - The macros for some functions defined in the C header files are
    now not defined if compiling C++.  They conflicted with the names
    of some member items of C++ classes in <iostream.h> or
    <complex.h>. Problem functions are <string.h>/index(),
    <math.h>/min(), max(), <fcntl.h>/open(), read(), write(),
    close(), <stdlib.h>/abs().  Many of these have alternate names
    using preceding underscores that can be used instead.
  - The priority of the autoinit functions for utility.library and
    the various Commodore math libraries were changed from 250
    to 100 in versions 6.51 and 6.55.  This allows the autoinitializer
    for the SPROF and GUIPROF profilers to use utility.library if it
    is compiled with UTILLIB.
  - And more new features + all known buggs are now fixed.

- Nino Brunori of the Visionary Unlimited is currently developing Coleco/
  ADAM computer Emulator. AmyNews will inform you when the release version
  is shipping. For more information please contact:

- Andreas M. Kirchwitz has upgraded Urban D. Mueller C-Shell to version
  5.40. C-Shell is a replacement for the AmigaDOS command line interface.
  C-Shell features many builtin Unix-like commands, very fast script 
  language, filename completion, command-name completion, comfortable
  command line editing, pattern matching, AUX: mode, object oriented 
  file classes, abbreviation of internal and external commands, support
  for multiple users, ease of installation and use, and online help for all
  commands, functions and various subjects. The new version features:
  - Fixed error message for builtin command "copy": if no special error
    message was available, always the string "(no mem)" was output.
  - New placeholders "-1" and "-2" for builtin command "window".
  - Increased maximum value for window dimensions from 1023 to 32767 for
    builtin command "window".

    Amiga console.device. (if env vars are set, no CSI sequence is sent)
  - Builtin command "mem" now shows size of largest available memory block.
  - Various minor changes/enhancements to existing commands.
  - Miscellaneous minor bug fixes.
  The new version of C-Shell is located in AmiNet.

- Good news. Softwoods very long awaited program, FinalCalc (FC), the 
  high-end spreadsheet that aims at providing the Amiga with something to
  compete with the top spreadsheets in the 'outside world' is in it's

- A new version 1.5 of the awesome all new swedish text editor FrexxEd is
  released. Version 1.5 features:
  - Danish users are now able to register in Denmark using danish currency
  - Rexx/ShowFPL.rx by Edd Dumbill is an *EXCELLENT* tool for all of you
    out there, who are not quite certain of which FPL programs to execute
    and which you shouldn't execute at startup. Try it!
  - Visible is appended to the top of the default file to make executions
    of it look much better after FrexxEd is started.
  - MenuSelect is a new exception that occurs when a menu item is 
    selected.
  - New functions: "GetFileList()" , "MenuRead()" and "MenuDelete()"
  - The execute file requester now remembers the directory.
  - Functions.guide now has the node-names without the 'node_' prefix
  - GetByte(column, line) returns the byte position of the given parameters
    or the current position. Like GetCursor() but the other way around!
  - MenuAdd() now accepts optional coordinates where to add the menu item!
  - New 3D style sliders while on screen.
  - WindowToFront() with parameter -1 makes a WindowToBack
  - ExecuteFile() now accepts a file pattern to be executed
  - The 'copywb' setting is removed, the function CloneWB() is to be used
    to copy the public screen information to the FrexxEd settings.
  - An 'R' in the status-line shows if the buffer is read-only
  - The screen will beep if you try to edit a read-only buffer
  - FlipComment.FPL is made to "Flip comments around C-lines"
  - Addition of the so far pretty simple FPL debugger 'FPLdb' to the 
    FrexxEd:bin/directory as well as an FPLdb.doc file. That file improves
    FPL debugging capabilities.
  - FrexxEd now allows buffer executions to export/cache FPL programs. That
    means you can write your FPL program in a buffer when debugging it. Re-
    executing the same buffer will make FrexxEd first flush the old program
    and then run the buffer again.
  - WordWrap.FPL is updated. It doesn't leave any trailing spaces at the
    end of lines any more. Requested by Svante Hedin.
  - Update the docs. New chapters about macros appeared and updated the
    regular expression chapter
  - New version 1.1 of the fpl.library
  - New set of FPL programs:
    - DeleteSpaceEOL.FPL:
      An entirely new beast. This scans and removes white spaces at the
      end of lines before saving them if the toggle buttons says so.
    - RememberView.FPL:
      Make FrexxEd remember the view positions when "amiga 1" is pressed.
      "amiga 2" restores the views back as they were!
    - ISpell.FPL:
      ISpell interface
    - CheckLinks.FPL:
      Amigaguide document link control
    - GotoLabel.FPL:
      Collects all assembler labels in a list and lets the user select one
      to jump to. A poor man's 'ETags'!!
  - LoadSaveProject.FPL is now updated.
  - Save As... now uses a "save-style requster".
  - SASC.FPL.README has more information.
  - ResizeView() now accepts a buffer ID parameter.
  - top_offset is a new setting (info variable). If contains the line of
    the window the current view starts at. The variable is writeable.
  - Activate() accepts a new parameter: buffer ID of the buffer that the
    new view should originate from.
  - ReplaceMatch() now accepts two new additional parameters: range and
    flags.
  - ETags.FPL and the etags archive was added. A major help tool to any
    programmer using FrexxEd.
  - Escape is now equivalent to 'q' in replace prompts. Request.
  - And all known bugs are fixed.
  The crippled SHAREWARE version may be doenloaded from AmiNet.

- Utilities Unlimited International, inventer of the Amiga Emplant
  technology is now shipping e586DX (IBM PC) Emulation Module. The e586DX

- Gary Huber, President of Questar Productions announces the availability
  of version 1.1 of the World Construction Set. The new version does, 
  among other improvment, feature "Contour", a new map drawing style in 
  the Map View Module. When selected it will give you a real contour map
  presentation. It works best at map scales larger than 2. The contour 
  inteval is set by the Exag field in the Map View Control window. It is
  the same interval as is used for the "Multi" gradient drawing style.
  The units are in meters. It is sometimes difficult to see the 
  Interactive elements (Camera, Focus, Haze, Sun) in Map View against one
  of the gray-scale topographic backgrounds. Contour style lets you see 
  some of the elevation information while clearly letting you see the 
  Interactive elements. This can be a big help when laying out key frames
  for an animation. For uppgrade information and ordering please contact:

  programs Pro-Net and Pro-Board. The new versions are reported to be much
  faster. More information about these new releases in a later issue of
  AmyNews.

- The very long awaited telser.device is now released. telser is a modem
  simulator over a TCP telnet/rlogin connection. It simulates basic modem
  commands, so you can use telecommunication programs over a network
  connection. To your comm  program, it thinks it's talking to a modem. 
  Terminal emulation, file  transfers, scripting, etc.  are all handled by
  your comm  program. Connecting to a host is as simple as typing "ATDT
  abc.edu,23" or even simpler if you add the host to your comm's phonebook.
  telser supports most of the telnet/rlogin negotiation commands and
  options.  For example, you may elect to notify the remote host on
  changes to your terminal emulation type, and window size.  An intuitive
  "gadtools" graphical user interface is supplied to control your
  connections. You also have the option to automatically connect to a host
  after starting up your comm program. Instant logins at the click of a
  button!
  telser can also run in host mode, which means it would accept incoming
  telnet/rlogin calls. Calls may be tracked by telser's caller ID feature.
  You can easily set up a "multi-line" BBS over the internet!
  telser is capable of unlimited device units, which means you can have
  unlimited incoming and outgoing connections. It supports both TCP/IP
  packages on the Amiga, namely AmiTCP (tested with 3.0b2 and 4.0/4.1)
  and AS225r2. A demo version of the package may be downloaded from AmiNet.

- Tensor Productions announces the availability of CyberScape version 2.5.
  CyberScape software is currently being used on commercial and research VR
  projects around the world. It is a cost-effective and non-intrusive 
  alternative to the more expensive and cumbersome goggle/glove VR systems.
  CyberScape uses the "projected reality" metaphor by which the person or
  subject is immersed in the virtual world through real-time video input -
  the same metaphor used in VIDEOPLACE and VIDEODESK systems by Myron 
  Krueger and Mandala (R) systems by the Vivid Group.
  CyberScape is a script-based, event-driven, multi-threaded authoring
  software that takes advantage of a physically based 2D animation system.
  For example, a complete two-team volley ball experience can be 
  constructed with only about 100 lines of code. CyberScape can be used for
  many types of applications like Interactive Music and Video Performances,
  Kinetic Scuptures and Cybernetic Arts, Interactive Learning and Training,
  Virtual Reality Constructions, Hypermedia Presentations, Interactive
  Video Games etc. CyberScape version 2.5 features:
  - Inputs:
    2 video inputs (NTSC or PAL), PowerGlove in hi-res mode, 2 mouse 
    inputs, 2 MIDI inputs, and 2 ARexx inputs.
  - Outputs:
    Serial device, Parallel device, MIDI output, ARexx output, and laser-
    disk player controls.
  - Collision Detections:
    Inter-object collisions, boundary collisions, multiple collision 
    classes.
  - Object Dynamics:
    Velocity, acceleration, damping force, gravitational force, spring
    force, constrained string force, etc.
  - Event Triggering:
    Object grab and release, scene transition, timed sequence, arithmetic
    and logic operations.
  - Graphics:
    640x400 (up to 20% overscan), 8-bit (256 colors) or HAM8 (256K colors),
    standard picture, brush, and animation files.
  - Audio:
    Standard sampled sound file, MIDI output, synthesized speech.
  - User Extensions:
    Linkable object library and interface source code included.
  New features since version 2.5:

- AmiGadget Publishing Company announces the release of Panorma version 4.
  Panorama is a fractal landscape generating program that allow the user
  sculpt a landscape by applying a variety of fractal parameters to initial
  data that can be graphically edited by moving peaks and valleys around on
  the screen with the mouse.  The program also imports data, including DEM
  (Digital Elevation Map) data for real places around the planet (or others).
  Panorma supports unattended operation for the creation of animations of
  any length, generated and recorded automatically, including automatic 
  support for single-frame video recording.  So, you can conduct a fly-by,
  or a fly-through, or follow a river as it meanders through lush, green
  valleys. Panorama can be entirely controlled and operated with software
  through its ARexx port. An extensive ARexx command structure provides 
  control over everything Panorama does. The Arexx functionality also 
  permits support of the VideoToaster and image processing software.
  Animation of finished landscapes can be achieved through an internal
  scripting language which includes the magic command "Tween" for easy
  scripting. Any feature can be animated, especially the program's awesome
  skies, and its waves and waterfalls (AmyNews: Amazing feature). Panorama
  can simply record a script as you work the program.  You can then edit 
  the script if you wish, to add Tween and other powerful functions.
  New new version 4.0 contains many enhancements and additional features 
  over the previous versions.  Panorama supports 24-bit pictures of any
  resolution, up to more than 8,000 by 8,000 pixels.  The program will work
  directly to several of the available frame buffers - OpalVision, Retina,
  and Picasso - and Version 4.0 has much better support of AGA machines.
  In addition, you can create and save AGA-only picture formats from
  Panorama running on non-AGA Amigas. It has added fractal dithering and
  textures. These can be applied to anything in the program for which 
  texture or dithering is appropriate - including tree leaves, water, 
  clouds, etc. The program includes some features normally associated with
  raytracing, such as shimmering reflections of the sky in the waves.
  The program lists for $99.95 US.  It is available direct from AmiGadget
  Publishing Company for an introductory price of $69.95.
  Updates from any previous version of the program are $35 US (+ $4 
  shipping), which includes the entire package: 5 floppy disks and the 
  completely revised manual.  Updates from any version of Genesis, add an
  extra $5.

- Erik Quackenbush of Quackenbush announces the release of pcmcom.device,
  Amiga PCMCIA driver for modems & serial ports.
 
  The pcmcom.device let's you use most PCMCIA modem and serial port cards
  in your PCMCIA equipped Amiga.  The driver emulates the Amiga's 'serial.
  device'.  Any communications program that supports alternate device
  drivers will work with the package.
  The driver supports the hardware FIFO buffers that are built into most
  PCMCIA modems to achieve error free communication at high speeds.  The
  driver supports connect baud rates up to 115.2 Kbps.  The package 
  includes a preferences program that allows extended baud rate selection.
  The software supports the X-Jack modems from Megahertz, and the Smart
  Serial Port card from Smart Modular Technologies.  Most other PCMCIA 
  modems and serial port cards are also supported.

- Data Compression Technologies has just release an all new Amiga packer
  called LZX. LZX is a brand new data compression program developed on and
  for the Amiga, sporting mind-blowing compression rates, and brain-
  staggering speed. LZX uses compression technology that is absolutely 
  state of the art, and offers a compression/performance ratio superior to
  that of all other programs for the Amiga, as well as to all programs for
  ms-dos. Aming tons of features LZX sports File merging, a feature which
  enables compression to be increased, often very significantly, by 
  allowing data from one file to be compressed using the knowledge of
  previous files in the archive.  This feature, unique to LZX on the Amiga
  , often improves compression by 300% or more!

- The UK company Almathera Systems Limited has just released an update
  version 1.1 to it's wonderful paint and image manipulation package
  Photogenics. The new version features:
  - Toolbar Changes
    - Smear
      Smear is a new powerful effect. When selected, the standard drawing
      options will smear the picture rather than applying a paint effect.
      Unlike other paint effects (eg. Negative) Smear does not use the
      standard system of operation where you can rub-out your work with the
      right mouse button. Both buttons do the same during smear. If you 
      have undo enabled you can use the Undo option from the menu to undo
      the LAST APPLIED smear operation. As smear affects the 24-bit data
      directly make sure you have a back-up of your image (either by 
      cloning the buffer or by saving to disk) before you start using
      Smear! Smear uses the current brush, so different effects can be
      used with other brush types like Chalk Pastel.
    - Colour Picker.
      Previosly this had no image.
  - Blur Paint Layer
    A new option has been added to the Alpha/Paint Layer menu called 'Blur
    Paint Layer'. This option will 'blur' the edges of the selected paint
    (without needing to fix it). If you draw a solid shape like a filled
    circle it normally has sharp, unnatural edges. By choosing this option
    the edges of this (and any other unfixed paint) are blurred so they 
    will blend into the background.
  - PCD.gio
    You can now load Photo .PCD files directly into Photogenics. Only the
    lowest three resolutions in .PCD (192x128, 384x256, and 768x512)
    are currently supported. This .GIO file loads and can automatically
    detect .PCD files
  - Close Workbench
    A new option to the settings menu, allows you to close workbench. 
    Select 'Close Workbench' if you are running short of memory.
  - Tolerance Fill
    This has been renamed 'Fill Similar'.
  - Colours Window
    If you press the 'Colours' button in the palette requester, you can
    now access the Colours window.  This lets you create spreads of
    colour, and also lets you see what palettes were saved with any images
    you may have loaded.
  - Greyscale
    The greyscale paintmode now has more options. Previously it had two
    different methods of calculating a greyscale picture. Now it has no
    less than eleven: Video Weighted, Simple Average, Brightest, Darkest,
    Median, Red Filter, Green Filter, Blue Filter, Cyan Filter, Magenta
    Filter, Yellow Filter
  - Brushes
    Four new brush types have been added to the program:
    - BallPen: Simulates a ballpoint ink pen. Like real pens the colours
               mix differently to normal paint.
    - Calligraphy: A simple angled nib calligraphy marker.
    - MarkerPen: Simulates a thick marker pen. Colour mixing works in a
               similar way to BallPen.
    - SprayCan: Spray can works like the airbrush but has a higher 
                pressure and defaults to continuous mode. Useful for
                highlighting areas for image processing.
  - Clock and Memory Display
  - Opalvision
    There are now two Opalvision displayers included Opal_Low and Opal_
    High. These replace the single displayer previously found in the
    program.

- We just recieved a fax from Advanced Systems & Software, AS&S, Germany,
  the maker of CyberVision and CyberStorm 68060 for the Amiga. The Amiga 
  4000 version of the CyberStorm is shipping now! The release date for 
  Amiga 3000 (YES, IT'S TRUE) is mid Feb 95! Also SOON! This baby sports a
  massive 85 Mips even in it's 50 MHZ (currently shipping). The CPU is 
  simply upgradable to the 80 Mhz version. The 80 Mhz 68060 will does apr.
  130 Mips! To get an idea how FASSTTTTT this babies are consider that an
  Amiga 3000/ 25 MHZ 68030 does apr. 7-8 MIPS. A4000/25 MHZ 68040 does apr
  18-19 MIPS. CyberVision 64, the fastest Amiga graphic board sporting S3
  technology is also shipping now for all ZORRO-III Amiga. 
  Phase 5 digital products development team (developer of Cyber products)
  , Official Motorola Beta Site Developer, is a leading technological 
  developer in the AMIGA sector. This has already been demonstrated with
  products such as the Fastlane Z3 or the Blizzard Series.
  Here is complete release information for these 2 Cyber products:
  - CyberStorm Amiga accelerator system sporting 68060 CPUs from Motorala
    This util consists of several modules but each CyberStorm system 
    contains a Carrier Board, a CPU Module and a Memory Board. The CPU 
    module can be exchanged for another version at any time without having
    to change any of the other components.  This concept guarantees optimal
    access speed and the greatest possible performance at each CPU speed.
    The CyberStorm System is not linked to any particular type of CPU.
    Processor modules with other than 680x0 processors can be installed at
    any time, as long as they are supported by the Amiga operating system.
    Wherever the future of the Amiga may lead, you can be assured that the
    CyberStorm will keep apace of technological advances.
    - CyberStorm Carrier Interface Board
      Inserts into the 200 pin Amiga Fast-Slot and contains ports for the
      CPU Module, Memory Board and the I/O Module. Fully asynchronous 
      interface between the modules. Extremely fast programmable logic,
      selected A-Grade FCT circuit logic, high-class high density connector
      Slot for 68060 software Boot ROM (or Flash ROM) or Ethernet Boot ROM
      (used with the CyberStorm I/O Module) to boot up the computer from a
      network hard drive.
    - CyberStorm CPU Module:
      Optimally tuned to the processor used and its speed Prepared for CPU
      clock speeds up to 80 MHz. Active CPU cooling, uncoupled CPU voltage
      supply with 5 or 3.3 Volt Voltage control at 3.3 V for 68060 version.
      Bi-directional high speed buffering with expensive A-Grade FCT 
      switching logic 120 pin high density port for Second Level Cache 
      Module or other expansions.
    - CyberStorm Memory module
      Slots for 4 SIMM modules in 32 bit technology standard 72 pin modules,
      Sizes: 4, 8, 16 and 32 MByte per module, freely mixable, maximum
      configuration 128 MByte. Fully DMA capable memory, also supports 
      Zorro3 DMA access. Fast 2-1-1-1 Burst Mode access when reading and
      3-1-1-1 when writing at 25 MHz RAM speed with 60 or 70 ns RAM) 
      achieving data transmission greater than 50 MByte/sec measured or
      effective value) Independent of CPU clock speed.
      The asynchronous interface concept also applies to the memory: the
      bi-directional buffer logic allows the CyberStorm CPU asynchronous 
      access to the memory which operates at the AMIGA system speed of 
      25MHz. This principle makes the memory transparent to other system
      components which access it by DMA, and avoids possible problems that
      can arise with so-called local memory designs which, for example, are
      directly linked with a CPU clock.  There is no principle speed 
      disadvantage over designs which operate the memory at higher clock
      speeds, as 25MHz is the upper limit for memory access without wait
      cycles (even for 60ns fast D-RAMs), which is performed on the 
      CyberStorm in Burst Mode Access. With a data throughput that is 
      nearly independent of the processor frequency of up to 66.66 MB/s in
      Burst Mode Access even a CyberStorm System clocked at 25 MHz 
      demonstrates clear acceleration, especially when working with large
      amounts of data.
    - CyberStorm I/O Module (Optional)
      Fast SCSI-II interface with internal and external 50 pin SCSI 
      connector. Data transmission in the full address area using its own
      32 bit DMA channel, FIFO buffered, bandwidth >30 MB/s. Asynchronous
      to 7 MB/s, synchronous to 10 MB/s data transmission on the SCSI bus
      with minimal CPU loading. The know-how gained from developing the 
      Fastlane Z3 (the world's first 32 bit SCSI Controller for the Amiga)
      was used extensively in the design of the SCSI interface, which has
      mature driver and utility software amongst other features. Extensive
      software including CD-ROM Filesystem, dynamic caching software and 
      various SCSI Tools.
      10 MBit/s Ethernet controller. SANA driver for transparent linking to
      various network systems. High speed due to its FIFO buffered, 32 Bit
      DMA channel Coaxial (BNC) and Dsub15 ethernet connector (Thin Ethernet
      /Standard Ethernet). 
      Serial high-speed interface RS232 with 115kbaud, with its own FIFO 
      buffer has also been integrated in the I/O Module to guarantee 
      problem-free operation of fast serial devices without data loss.
    - CyberStorm Cache Module (Optional)
      No further information currently available.
    The CyberStorm CPU Module also offers another High Speed Connector with
    direct processor connection through which, for example, cache memory 
    and boards with second processors (e.g.  DSPs) or other high speed 
    expansions can be connected. All CyberStorm components are manufactured
    in Germany to the highest industrial quality in modern Fine Pitch SMD
    technology and are subjected to complete functionality test prior to
    delivery. A3000 and A4000T versions have limited modularity and 
    expansion capabilities.
  - CyberVision 64, ultrafast 64-bit graphic acceleration system for Amiga:
    The CyberVision 64 satisfies the most demanding requirements on 
    performance and system conformity because of its combination of an
    extremely fast 32 bit Zorro-3 interface, a 64 bit wide graphics 
    controller and exceptional software. Based on the highly integrated
    graphic chip Trio64 from the renowned manufacturers S3, which 
    integrates an expensive graphics processor, a complex 64 bit wide
    Blitter as well as a highly efficient 24 bit converter for D/A 
    conversion, the CyberVision 64 can offer a video band width of 135 MHz.
    It will, therefore, support a variety of resolutions in True Color, 
    High Color and 256 colours. The CyberVision 64 32 Bit Zorro3 interface
    is highly optimised and allows transmission rates from the AMIGA main
    memory to the graphic memory of up to 16 MByte/sec - an exemplary rate
    that sets new standards. Data transfers within the CyberVision 64 
    video memory are executed by the 64 Bit Blitter at speeds above 100
    MByte/sec, practically in an imperceptible amount of time, resulting
    in extremely fast shifting operations, for example. Another special
    feature of the CyberVision 64 is its hardware support of Planar-to-
    Chunky Conversion which, with Amiga graphics cards, often takes up most
    of the time required for emulation/representation of the Amigamodes.
    This hardware solution is some 6-8 times faster than typical software
    solutions which considerably accelerates the emulation and 
    representation of Amiga modes and especially the representation of 8
    Bit graphics. Complementing this efficient hardware is excellent driver
    software which fully utilises the performance of the card for unusual
    system conformities. The CyberVision 64 screen modes are installed via
    the CyberVision 64 monitor files, are available via normal ASL-
    Requester (e.g.  in screen mode in PREFS) as "normal" system 
    resolutions, and for common applications operating under OS3.0 or 3.1
    require no additional driver.
    The CyberVision 64 has an expansion bus through which additional cards
    such as JPEG or MPEG cards can directly access the fast video memory
    making the CyberVision 64 suitable for future developments. The
    combination of the attention that has been paid to necessary details,
    such as slipped through AMIGA video signal and integrated, loss-free 
    electronic switching, default-monitor-timing on system start-up or 
    simple expansion of the 2MB version to 4MB with common memory modules,

- We are proud to include promised information about DraCo, the first
  real Amiga clone developed by MacroSystem GmbH Germany in this issue
  of AmyNews:
	DraCo fulfills the dream of an affordable, powerful, and professional
  video and graphics workstation. DraCo offers perfect quality animation
  recording, non-linear editing, and animation rendering. DraCo is not an
  Amiga.  But you can run most of the Amiga hardware and software 
  applications with astoundingly dramtic results. 
  DraCo is an Amiga OS compatible computer that doesn't use the Amiga
  custom chip set.  These chips are replaced with powerful software and
  hardware combinations.  The blitter, for example, is replaced by the 
  powerful NCR 53C720 chip which is used, for example, in the Warp Engine.
  DraCo is based around the Motorola 060 processor, UNIX and UNIX clone
  support are included as well. This workstatation is certainly the most
  powerful video and graphics computer in this price category. (priced in
  the same equipped A4000 range)
  Technical data:
  - Processor:  Motorola 68060
  - Operating System:  Amiga OS & various UNIX Systems
  - Case:  Full size tower
  - I/O:  Fast SCSI-II with NCR 53C720 & Parallel Port
  - Slots: Two DraCo direct 32 bit interfacws dedicated for the Retina
    BLT and VLab Motion. The retina is standard in every computer, the
    VLab motion is optional. Five Zorro II slots for boards like the 
    Toccata, Emplant, Ethernet, VLab Y/C, serial ports, additional 
    parallel ports, etc.
  - Drive: Triple speed CD ROM drive standard, other SCSI devices optional
  - Graphics:  DraCo Retina BLT with 120 Mhz pixel frequency and data rate
    of over 180MB/Second in 24 bit
  - Memory:  4MB standard, expandable to 128MB
  - Software Compatibility:  All system compatible programs that runs on
    graphics cards like the Retina will work.
  - Hardware Compatibility:  All hardware products that are custom chipset
    independent. This includes the Toccata, Emplant, etc.
 
- Todd Vierling announces that a gamma version 0.9.1 of AmiNIX, a new 
  implementation of BSD UNIX is now released. It runs on any 680x0 series
  processor, and does not require either an MMU or FPU. It does not have
  the superstrict protection that NetBSD or Linux have, and is not
  designed for that; AmiNIX is designed for UNIX compatibility on few-to-
  one-user systems and for restricted remote use (via rksh and the like).
  AmiNIX is an ``extension'' that gives UNIX ability to AmigaOS. The
  release version 1.0 is under development.

- When we first during the last months of the last year, informed you 
  about the release of the must have program Pegger, the Amiga Image 
  Compression Software, version 2.0, we forgot to include the press 
  release for the new version. Ok here it is. 
  Heifner Communications Inc. is proud to announce the availability of
  V2.0 of their product, PEGGER, an automated image compression system for
  Amiga computers. PEGGER version 2.0 brings powerful new features to
  improve the performance and useability of their already popular product.
  New features in version 2.0 include:
  - SNOOP By Program
    This incredible new SNOOP mode allows the user to specify the 
    compression and decompression mode on a program-by-program basis. Now,
    many different programs can read compressed images from the same 
    directory but using different file formats!
  - Incredible Speed Improvement
    Pegger is now roughly twice as fast as the original Pegger and 
    certainly the fastest image compression/decompression system on the
    Amiga!
  - New File Formats
    Pegger now supports Impulse RGB8, IFF 8-bit color, IFF 8-bit greyscale
    (useful for texture maps alpha channel images), JPEG greyscale, TARGA 
    Color, and TARGA Greyscale, and NewTek Toaster CG Framestore Pages.
  - Full Network Support
    Pegger now has fully tested network support. We have tested the 
    network support with ParNet, ENLAN-DFS, and Novell.
  - More configuration options
    More configuration options for starting Pegger have been added as
    TOOLTYPES in the Pegger icon.
  - Of Course, Lots of Bug fixes!
  Original Features of Pegger Include:
  - ARexx support.
  - Support for NewTek Framestore, 24-bit IFF, DCTV, and HAM8 images.
  - PEGGER can process images up to 32000 pixels wide using less than
    4 MB of system RAM.
  - AmigaDOS 2.0 & 3.0 compatible.
  - Follows all AmigaDOS programming guidelines.
  - Adjustable priority for JPEG compression and decompression.
  - PEGGER is designed to multi task in the background using minimal 
    system resources so a 3D rendering or graphics program can also run at
    the same time.
  - Snoop feature allows PEGGER to compress the output of your 3D 
    rendering or graphics program into a JPEG file automatically.
  - JPEG code has been optimized in 100% 68000 assembly for speed.
  Uppgrade fee for curent Pegger user is $15.00 US + shipping/handling.

- Eureka's president Frank Hoen release information about current Eureka's
  products and the products under development:
  - Communicator II, the improved version of the very popler Communicator 
    for CD32 is now available. The Communicator II makes CD32 an 
    intelligent 2 way computer with CD-rom controlled by the amiga.
    Highlights for the new Communicator II are:
    - Software improvments:
      - Speed:
        Transfer speed can be reached of upto 210000 baud.
      - Virtual disk:
        Using non-volatile ram of the CD32, the user can select which menu
        program he wants to boot with.
      - User Interface:
        The Bootup Menu and Communicator program are integrated into 1 
        easy to use program.
      - Visual Feedback:
        Visual feedback is given when the CD32 receives commands. Examples
        of visual feedback are playing CD's, setting the baudrate, showing
        when files are being transferred etc.
      - File Transfer:
        The Communicator II now has 3 ways of transferring files; Safety, 
        CD-rom and High-speed CLI.
      - CD32 AGA viewer:
        View pictures and animations from CD or amiga in 16.7 Million 
        colours. The viewer functions as framebuffer for non-aga machines
        enabling you to view AGA pictures in 16.7 Million colours.
      - WorkBench:
        A newer version is installed for improved compatibility.
      - MediaPoint and Scala drivers:
        Included the Scala driver, the new Communicator II is now supplied
        with the new Mediapoint Full motion video (needs Full Motion Video
        cartridge); Mpeg, and Audio Xapp offering advanced audio and video
        control.
    - Hardware improvments:
      - The new Communicator II hardware case has an extra A2000/3000 key-
        board plug next to it's standard CD32/ A4000 keyboard plug.  Also
        the serial cable to the amiga is now a DB25 serial to RJ10 jack
        (telephone) plug.  The serial cable can be easily changed and has
        a cable guard.  The Communicator to CD32 connector is strengthened
        even more and the Communicator's LED's are now on the front for 
        even better visibility.  This added to the steel plated case makes
        for a very robust design.
    The low cost Communicator Lite II has the same features as the full
    blown Communicator II except it doesn't have LED's, a MIDI, keyboard
    interface and the advanced power control of the Communicator.
    For Communicator users software upgrades can be obtained from their
    Communicator dealer or directly from Eureka at extra charge.
  - Further products from Eureka are the Afterburner 50mhz 68030 turbo for

- Amiga E Compiler package, the natural source for the Amiga E programmers
  is now available in an all new version 3.1a. The Amiga E Compiler was 
  developed over the course of more than three and a half years, after the
  author's idea of a good programming language, and a quality amiga-
  specific compiler for it. It was programmed (as you might have guessed)
  in 100% assembly. All other support programs were written in E itself.
  E is an object oriented / procedural / unpure functional higher 
  programming language, mainly influenced by languages such as C++, Ada,
  Lisp etc. It is a general-purpose programming language, and the Amiga
  implementation is specifically targeted at programming system 
  applications. The number of features of the language is really too great
  to sum up entirely and include:
  speed of >20000 lines/minute on a 7 Mhz amiga, inline assembler and
  linker integrated into compiler, large set of integrated functions, 
  great module concept with v39 includes as modules, flexible type-system,
  quoted expressions, immediate and typed lists, low-level and object 
  polymorphism, exception handling, inheritance, data-hiding, methods,
  multiple return values, default arguments, register allocation, fast
  memory management, unification, LISP-Cells, (macro-) preprocessor, 
  source-level debugger, and much more...
  The new version 3.1a among a lot of bug fixes features:
  - SourceLevel debugging! option DEBUG/S and external debugger EDBG
  - Built-in preprocessor! (conditional compilation & macro 
    preprocessing), Mac2E and Cpp compatible
  - The SUPER keyword allows calling of superclass methods
  - Some new example sources, new tool modules (FilledVector, EasyGUI 
    and more)
  - new versions of Aprof and EE
  - docs updated: new features, FAQ etc...
  Amiga E is shareware and can be registred directly by it's auther. A
  demo version is available in Aminet. For registration and further 
  information, please contact:

- Daniel S. Milling Jr. announces the release of RenderCalc version 1.46,
  the ultimate multimedia tool for 3D artist that want to know the number
  of frames it would take for an object moving X miles per hour to move Y
  feet. RenderCalc features:
  - Ability to enter values for Speed and Distance and receive output
    telling the user how many total frames, seconds, minutes and the 
    length of time, in the specified time code format, that the motion
    will take.
  - The Speed, Distance and Length Input Gadgets have Cycle gadgets 
    attached to them which allows you to change the units of the entered
    number 'on the fly.' This gives you instantaneous updates without 
    having to re-type the number.
  - Table of conversions between units of length.  Supported units are
    inches, feet, yards, miles, millimeters, meters and kilometers.
  - Ability to change the units of ANY inputted number and have all of the
    values update, relative to the new units, on the fly.  This saves 
    having to re-type the values.
  - If you want to convert a number to different units, you may enter
    that number into the Length gadget and see the printed results in the
    conversion table below.
  - The table of conversions is linked to the Distance and Length gadgets,
    which means that any number entered in either gadget will be converted
    and printed into the table.  The reason for this is that if you enter
    a number into the Distance gadget and would like to know what it 
    converts to in units of a different system, you don't have to re-type
    it into the Length gadget.  It is automatically calculated and printed
    for you.
  - SMPTE non-drop frame, EBU and Film time code supported.  SMPTE drop
    frame is NOT implemented at this time.
  - Ability to enter Time Code In and Out points as well as a Duration.
    The time code values are printed out under the Time Code Output 
    section. The time code input has two modes of operation.  You may
    enter Time Code In and Time Code Out points which results in Duration
    being the final output value. You may also enter a Time Code In and a
    Duration which will give you the Time Code Out as your final value.
  - Ability to add/subtract either timecode values or a number of frames
    from any of the Timecode Input values.  This saves a lot of time and 
    comes in quite handy when you need to alter an already inputed value.
  - Ability to enter a decimal frame value and have it converted to the
    appropriate time code, relative to the current Time Code Type.
  - Ability to change the Time Code Type 'on the fly.'  This means that 
    you may switch between the supported time code formats and see the 
    updated results immediately without having to re-enter the values.
  - And more.
  A full demo version of the program is available on AMINET.

- Bruce Dawson from Cygnus Software (he wrote the wonderful CygnusEditor,
  CEd) announces the release of a new version 2.01 of the best fractal 
  exploration program for the Amiga, Mand2000. Mand2000 draws pictures of
  the Mandelbrot set and other fractals on your Amiga and allows you to
  explore them by doing animated zooms towards interesting areas. Mand2000
  combines speed, power and simplicity with a few unique features, all 
  designed to make it easy for you to discover uncharted regions of the
  Mandelbrot set, Julia set and other fractals. Feature list:
  - Point and click animated zooming, the most intuitive way of exploring
    the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. Just point and double click.
  - Mand2000 allows you to pan across fractal images using your keyboard,
    mouse, or joystick.  Plug in your joystick to scroll and zoom your way
    around the most complex object ever seen.
  - Mand2000's multi-pass drawing lets you see an approximation of the 
    final picture in a fraction of the total calc time.  Even for pictures
    that will take several minutes to complete, you can get a good idea of
    what your picture will look like almost immediately.  This allows you
    to quickly decide whether to keep zooming, or wait for the completed
    picture.
  - Mand2000 has a multi-window, multi-requester design.  You can adjust
    parameters and see the changes in real time as Mand2000 continues
    calculating while you use the requesters.  Leave as many requesters 
    and fractal windows open as you want.
  - Mand2000 lets you calculate fractal zoom movies quickly, by 
    calculating key frames and letting Mand2000's TweenPlayer create the
    intermediate frames at playback.
  - Mand2000 has full AGA support, compatibility with the all third party
    graphics boards in up to 256 colour mode, literally dozens of 
    different assembly language math routines for accuracies ranging from
    16 bit to 1000+ bit, on-line help, printing, multi-level undo, built
    in locations to start you searching, full featured ARexx support, 
    several ARexx scripts supplied, graphical displaying of your location,
    etc.
  - Mand2000 supports rendering fractals in HAM, HAM8, and dithered 256 
    colour.  This allows you to display your fractals in thousands of
    different colours - on ANY Amiga.  The entire user interface will now,
    optionally, run in these modes, allowing a separate palette for each
    fractal window, each palette consisting of thousands of colours.
  - Mand2000 creates anim files directly.  Iteration movies, Julia seed
    movies, morph movies, and whatever animation types you feel like
    adding. All of these are written out in the standard anim format, for
    immediate playback with any animation player.

- The best Directory Utlity program (no matter what platform you are 
  thingking about), DirectoryOpus in an ALL NEW version 5.0, is due to an
  immediate release during the first months of 1995. A demo version 5.0
  was shown in the WoA Dec 95 in London. The program is now mainly

- Utilities Unlimited International, inventer of the Amiga Emplant
  technology is announcing the new version 5.0 of the software for the
  Macintosh emulation module. Jim Drew of UU, showed "e586DX", the IBM-PC
  module for the Emplant at the Dec 94 Word of Amiga Show in London.
  The software emulates a Pentium chip (without the bug :-). The  CPUID
  instruction  returns  "Amiga  Inside"  as vendor information :-)
  The emulation requires a GFX board with a VGA controller, like the
  Picasso  or Piccolo. The emulation works  very stable. All x86 
  instructions are translated 1-to-1 on the fly, so the speed of the 
  emulation depends on the type of  operation. On the test machine at
  the show, memory moves were 2.5 times faster than on a 486DX2-66, but
  computational intensive instructions are slower.
  The PC emulator will be available in mid  January 95.  It will require
  a replacement of a logic chip on the Emplant board  and the emulation 
  software.
 
- Helmut Hoffmann announces the release of EGSPhotoAlbum version 1.7, the

    flip the pages without use of the control window. The menu entries
    also have keyboard shortcuts.
  - Remove function
    The delete function of V1.5 has been extended by a remove function,
    which does not actually delete files on disk but just removes pictures
    from the preview page
  - Separate directory for preview files selectable
    You can now select a separate preview file directory. This allows 
    usage of the fast preview files also with readonly media as CD-ROMs
  - Different preview file formats which can save disk space
    You can now select different preview file formats to optimize speed
    or disk usage (former versions only used the fast but uncompressed
    P6 format; now IFF or JPeg can also be used for preview files).
  Helmut Hoffmann's wonderful EGS-TV is now available in a new verison 
  3.6b. EGS-TV now officially support the ImpactVision IV24 framegrabber.

  The driver implements horizontal and verical whitespace stripping, as
  well as Epson compression mode 2 ("TIFF v4.0 packbits mode") to minimize
  the amount of data that must be sent to the printer and improve printing
  speed. A beta tester reported speed on an Amiga 3000 comperable to that 
  of a 66MHz 486 with Epson's MS-Windows driver.
  The driver implements a very simple color correction for 720dpi modes to
  prevent them from printing excessively dark.  This gives results similar
  to other drivers on the same printer (for example, the PageStream 2.x 
  LQ2550C driver). "Endicor Technologies, Inc." is investigating a future
  update with improved color correction, which will provide more accurate
  colors and better gradation.

- The US company Softwood is working on a new spreadsheet program for the
  Amiga. It will blow away anything out for the Amiga to date. Supposedly
  it will be on the scale of Excel. FinalCalc (FC) is a high-end spread-
  sheet that aims at providing the Amiga with something to compete with
  the top spreadsheets in the 'outside world'.
  Its main formula recalc engine has been written to be significantly more
  powerful than the current generation of spreadsheets.  The engine always
  does a 'natural' recalc.  i.e. formulas are evaluated in the order of 
  their inter-dependancies, no matter how complex, making sure that the
  result of a formula is correct.
  The recalc engine always runs in the _background_.  The user never waits
  for FC to recalculate.  You keep on editing cells while FC chugs along 
  in the background, catching up and updating the display as you work. 
  This is very smooth and has to be used to be believed.  Even with this,
  the recalc code itself is very fast anyway, recalculating only what has
  changed or needs to be recalculated, not the entire project.
  FinalCalc's user interface is designed to be both easy to use, and
  power-user friendly.  Everything is keyboard/hotkey driven as well as
  mouse driven. Almost every function, requester, feature can be 
  controlled from the keyboard without using the mouse.  The user 
  interface can come up on any screen mode and use any Amiga font, even
  changing the screen mode and/or the user font on the fly.
  FinalCalc supports multiple sheets per 'Project'.  (a project can 
  consist of 1 to 254 sheets, each containing a maximum of ZZZ (18277)
  columns and 65000 rows.)
  FinalCalc has very powerful printing features, great 2D and 3D graphs,
  more than 630 arexx/script commands, and tons of features.
 
- The WARP System, a Transputer System for the Amiga, from the US company
  Cybernetic, is now released. The specs for the WARP are very impressive.
  WARP basically allows you to load off cpu intensive tasks to Transputer
  boards using the Warp OS. You can add as many boards as you want to 
  your system, increasing performance proportionally.  The base board does
  around 50 Mips and installs in a Zorro slot.  The other boards (Warp 
  Twin 70 Mips, Warp Tripple 105 Mips) are then connected to the base 
  board. System comparisons to an Amiga 4000/40 are quite impressive, a
  render that take around 1 hour on an A4000/40, take around 50 seconds
  on a 1000 Mips Warp system. A Warp System adapted (rendering engine) 
  for Adspec's Aladdin 4D is available, others including Real3D and 
  Lightwave are to follow. Cybernetic also announces Cybernetica's 
  "Reality Prime Engine Series" of software, a system of modules designed
  to work initially with Warp System, and later with other software on a
  standard Amiga. These releases, each with the engine tag, will add a 
  host of options for 3D animators. The lineup is slated LighEngine (for
  ray-tracing and radiosity), Physics (for animation control), Paint (for
  image-processing, compositing and painting), Modeling, Animation, 
  Morphing, Particle, Sound, Video and more. The releases will be
  staggered.  The Light Engine and Cybernetica's Newton's Law (animation
  module for LightWave) have already been released.

- The wait is over ;-) The UK based company Almathera is finaly due to
  the immediate release of it's long-awaited program, Photogenics. Being
  called "The Next Generation Image Processor", Photogenics is a hybrid
  of an image processor and paint package. Photogenics combines the
  features of a powerful image manipulation package with the ease-of-use
  and creative freedom of a traditional paint program.
  You can load a variety of different images (JPEG, GIF, IFF, etc.) 
  and save them in different formats, but Photogenics is much more than
  just a simple conversion system.  Artists will love the multiple built
  in natural brushes (chalk, pencil, pastel, etc...), or you may perfer
  to retouch pictures with the airbrush.  Through the variety of 
  operations and the powerful visual alpha channels, image manipulation
  has never been so enjoyable.
  You can edit multiple images - each in its own resizable window.  The
  realtime HAM-8 display gives you full-colour painting without needing a
  24-bit graphics board.
  Photogenics's interface allows you to work on several images at one time
  by opening a re-sizeable window for each one. Thanks to the program's
  open architecture, you will be able to add your own effects, loaders
  and savers.
  Designed for graphics artists and serious painters, Photogenics gives a
  professional working environment offering many features not even found
  on PC or Mac packages.  The open-architecture design gives programmers
  the freedom of writing their own loaders, savers or effects.
  Photogenics will be introduced at the World of Amiga show on Dec 94.

  dynamic range of 95! decibels. SoundSwitch includes the Mixer, Meter
  and SMPTE modules from SunRize's studio 16. It's compatible with any
  edit controller for the Video Toaster, including NewTek's Video Toaster
  Flyer and RGB's AmiLink.
 
- An all new version of the wonderful DiskSalv 3.0 version 11.32 (4Q/94),
  the original Amiga disk recovery tool is now released. Developed by Dave
  Haynie and published by Intangible Assets Manufacturing, it is the 
  fourth major revision of DiskSalv, and it offers features never before
  found in DiskSalv or other Amiga disk utilities. DiskSalv 3.0 v11.32 
  features:
  - A Hot New Look
    The old user interface has been completely reworked. While the best
    features have been retained, much has been improved. The font 
    sensitivity is better than everThe overall look is cleaner, with
    graphical queues throughout that enhance operations without making
    undue demands on your system's memory or pretending to be a video 
    game. Gadgets and help texts are context sensitive.  Device selection
    throughout is drag-and-drop, though of course enhanced list selection
    is still available for the asking. Interactive AmigaGuide links are
    provided for every gadget and menu function.
  - An Ounce of Prevention
    A disk can now be checked for troubles without actually making any
    repairs, for extra confidence. Deleted directories, files, and data
    can be permanently erased for added security, program releases, etc.
    Traditional full or incremental backups are supported, in the same 
    style as DiskSalv's recovery functions.
  - And a Pound of Cure
    You still get traditional DiskSalv functions, only better.  Undeletes
    can often be performed in-place.  A fully redesigned filter mechanism
    supports pattern matching on full pathnames, file notes, dates, file
    sizes, and/or protection bits.  Pattern matches can be used to include
    a file in a scan, exclude it, or stop a scan on a match.  Any number
    of filter groups may be active at the same time, and such groups may
    be loaded from disk.
  - When Time Counts
    A new intelligent prefetching disk cache, buffered file I/O, and 
    improved internal design makes DiskSalv faster than ever. The scroll
    bar calculations have been refined for greater accuracy.
  - There's Nothing to Lose
    Device description editing and volume searching functions have been
    greatly enhanced.  DiskSalv can freely convert between its internal
    device format, standard Amiga ASCII format (DOSDrivers files), and
    Rigid Disk Blocks (the standard autoboot format).
  - Going by the Book
    A complete, on-line AmigaGuide manual is included to aid both beginner
    and advanced user. Details range from the basics through a complete
    theory of operation. Decriptions of all DiskSalv file formats and
    associated C Language "include" files are also supplied.

- SoftWood new Database program for the Amgia, "Final Data" version 1.0
  is now released. Final Data is an easy-to-use, flat file data manager.
  Final Data's purpose is to provide a simple, yet powerful way for people
  to orgainize and print lists of information on their Amiga. It is ideal
  for tasks such as:
  - name and adress lists (friends, customers, business contacts, etc.)
  - collections of any type (video, CD, stamp, coin, etc.)
  - reference material such as titles of books and periodicals
  - home inventory, bills, birthday reminders, and appointments
  A Final Data database appears on the screen as a table with rows and
  columns similar to the way a spreadsheet looks.  Viewing a database in
  this manner lets you look at a lot of information at the same time. 
  Columns may be narrowed or widened by dragging a column's border with
  the mouse.
  Data is entered into cells in a similar manner as entering data into a
  word processor or text editor. As you go from cell to cell entering data
  the program verifies that the information you enter is consistent with
  the type of information expected.
  Final Data can arrange data in any desired sequence. A unique feature
  gives you the option of sorting either an entire database or only 
  selected rows.  The search and replace feature lets you make changes in
  the same manner as in a word processor.
  You can print a database in either label or columnar report format.
  Final Data prints reports complete with page headings that included 
  title and page number. Reports may also be printed with totals and row
  counts.
  Labels can be defined in a variety of user-defined formats. Labels can
  be printed from one to many across a page.  Final Data uses a printer's
  built-in fonts for maximum speed and readability.
  Final Data was programmed fromthe beginning with ARexx in mind. There
  are over 75 Final Data ARexx commands that you can use to develop 
  scripts. There is also a user-defined ARexx menu you can use to access 
  your scripts.

- The Netherland based company Lyppens Software Productions announces the
  release of Video Backup System, VBS, version 3.0. Major features of the
  new version include:
  - User interface
    The  VBS  3.0  software  is compatible  with  all  Amigas  and
    requires AmigaOS 2.x/3.x or higher. VBS is now even easier  to
    use  and has a completely redone 2.0-look user interface.  You
    can  customize it by means of font and screen mode-requesters.
    VBS can also run on the Workbench-screen.
  - Speed
    There  are new backup modes for Amigas with an 68020 or higher
    CPU  (A1200, A2500, A3000, A4000). The first one gives a speed
    improvement  of  a  factor 2 compared to  V1.5,  without  data
    compression. The typical thoughput in this case  is  85MB  per
    hour,  for a total of 340MB per 4-hour  video tape! The  other
    new  mode adds data compression to this, and is up to 3  times
    as fast as V1.5 (depending on the compression ratio achieved).
    With 130MB per hour, 520MB will fit on a 4-hour tape.
    VBS 3.0 can read and write V1.5 backups without problems.
  - Partial Restore
    In  3.0, it is no longer necessary to replay the entire backup
    when  only a few files are to be restored. After VBS has  read
    the  directory tree structure from the VCR, the  tape  can  be
    fast  forwarded  if  the desired file is  far  away  from  the
    beginning.   During Restore and Verify, VBS  displays  on  the
    screen which file and directory it is currently working on.
  - Counter type
    VBS  now supports VCRs having a numeric instead of a real-time
    counter.
  - Settings
    VBS now has a requester for the following settings:
    - Counter type (Numeric/Time).                 
    - Video Connection Check (on/off).             
    - Use Public screen (on/off).                  
    - Beep after backup (on/off).                  
    - Log file/Report directory.                   
    - Fonts for user interface and Visual Header.  
    - Screen mode.                                 
  - Batch Backup
    The  Video Backup System now lets you define a list of backups
    to  be  made. Previously, it was necessary to manually make  a
    separate  backup for each hard disk partition. With  VBS  3.0,
    you simply enter the desired partitions in the batch list. VBS
    will  then successively make separate backups for each one  of
    these  partitions. The batch backup can be programmed to start
    either at a specific time-of-day or directly.
    If  desired,  the software can give an audio signal  when  the
    backup(s) are ready.
  - Installer
    Installation of VBS 3.0 on your hard drive is done  using  the
    Commodore Installer: user friendly and trouble-free.

- Andreas M. Kirchwitz has upgraded Urban D. Mueller C-Shell to version
  5.39. C-Shell is a powerful replacement for the AmigaDOS CLI. Summary
  of the new feature for this version:

  - New builtin variable "_timeout" (in microseconds) sets maximum
     response time for terminal to answer WINDOW STATUS REQUEST (for
     window bounds). Defaults to 1 (for local usage), must be set to
     higher value for remote connections. Only used, if window pointer
     is not available.
  - Removed command line length limitation (140 chars) for ARexx scripts
     that ends with ".rexx" but are started without the trailing ".rexx".
  - Removed command line length limitation (518 chars) for ARexx scripts
     and external shells (#! in first line), this was a limitation in
     AmigaOS' System() function.  DOS scripts still have this limitation,
     because you cannot RunCommand() "execute".
  - Not only "*" and "?" but also "[" and "]" recognized as AmigaDOS
     pattern. (that means, to use "[" and "]" you must quote (") or
     escape (\) them!)
  - ... and much more workarounds for serious bugs in DateToStr() and
     Locale.
  - Fixed bug: making an assign to an executable and calling the
     executable by its assign crashed machine.
  - Fixed bug: builtin command "cp" sometimes used already freed memory
     for generating error messages (resulted in some strange error
     messages).
  - New flag for for command abbreviation ($_abbrev):
     8, search DOS path-list if command wasn't found in Cshell's
     internal program hash list (see "rehash" command)
  - CTRL-D now shows matching files if current word is not a directory.
     (if directory then shows contents of directory -- as usual)
     In its current implementation this may have unexpected side effects
     if current word is already a pattern.
  - Class definition for AmigaE in class.sh
  - Now internal timer (eg, %e in the titlebar) not set to zero when a
     null command is encountered. (same for return code, %x in titlebar)
  - The idea of always using the variable "_dirformat" for "dir" wasn't
     a good idea.  So, "_dirformat" is only used if option -z is given
     (when "_dirformat" is unset then use first argument as format
     string).
  - New control-code for line-editing: "^V" (ctrl-v) quotes next char.
  - New builtin variable "_kick" holds version number of Operating
     System.
  - Builtin command "assign" now prints volume name if assign points to
     an unmounted volume (eg, a removed floppy disk) and doesn't pop up
     a requester "Please replace volume ..."
  - It was a stupid idea to force redirecting of all Cshell-related
     system requesters to CSH's screen, because requester windows
     inherit the window title of their "initiator". They appear now
     again on your default public screen.
  - Fixed serious bug (crashed machine) with redirection and launching
     programs into background. (files closed twice)
     Known bug: it's still not possible to run pipes into background...
  - When running programs into background (run, rback, &), internal
     commands and aliases are recognized and executed with "csh -c".
     Aliases WON'T be resolved on this level so they must be declared
     in .cshrc to run them into background.
  - Execution of Rexx-Scripts (without trailing ".rexx") and any other
     program with "#! my_prog" or ";! my_prog" in first line of script
     now possible also from DOS search path and not only $_path.
  - New builtin variable "_mappath" (see manual), enables pathname-
     mapping for commands if script starts with "#!" or ";!" in first
     line.  Converts Unix pathes like "/usr/..." to "usr:...".
  - New option "-w" for Cshell, don't use window pointer (useful for
     KingCON).
  - New option "-V" for Cshell, send only VT100 compatible control
     sequences.
  - Internal variable "o_vt100" now used (if option -t or -V is set),
     don't send control sequences that are not VT100 compatible (eg,
     special Amiga control sequences).
  - Various changes/enhancements to existing commands.
  - Miscellaneous bug fixes.

  editing program CAVIN.  It supports all kinds of hardware (Control-L,
  LANC, PANASONIC-EDIT, RS232 and RS 422 protocolls) and timecode (VITC,
  TCTC, RAPID). You can also use infrared signals for older hardware.
  CAVIN hast timelines for A & B VCR's, graphics / animation, hardware
  (i.e. framegrabber, M-JPEG boards, cd-player), audio (Amiga, audio 
  boards or external). So you can use it as a complette A/B editing 
  system.
  You can of course configure CAVIN to work in conjunction with other 
  Pro Dad products, such as clariSSA, Monument Titler and Adorage.
  ProDad has also upgraded older products.  Adorage 2.5 now supports a
  transparent colour 0, image conversion and loading of different image
  types (i.e.  TIFF, PCX) and has some new 3D effects.
  There are two new modules for clariSSA, the Loaderpackage allows you to
  import new image formats (i.e.  GIF, JPEG, PCX), while the "motion 
  sound" add on allows you to add samples to your SSA animations.

- Terra Nova Development of Ventura, California has released Volume One of
  its Designer Objects series of 3D models.  This first volume, "DINER", 
  is a three disk set of objects for Impulse, Inc.'s Imagine software for
  Amiga computers.
  The Diner set includes a variety of objects that together build a
  complete diner of the early 1950's, including a jukebox, counter, 
  booths, a pay telephone, dishes, cups, silverware, and other items for
  place settings.  In many cases there are both `hi-res' and `lo-res' 
  versions versions of objects so that artists can optimize their scenes
  for either image quality or speedy rendering.
  In addition to the objects and image maps there are two Imagine projects
  on the disks.  One, with scenes that can be rendered on five megabyte
  systems, offers fairly simple scenes; the other features more complex
  scenes that require up to fourteen megabytes to render.  A manual is
  included.
  The Designer Objects series is intended to showcase the talents of
  gifted 3D artists by making available affordable collections of their 3D
  objects.  The Diner objects were created by award-winning computer artist
  Bradley W. Schenck, whose work should be familiar to the Amiga community
  through articles and artworks including wins in the BADGE Killer Demo
  Contests of 1988 and 1989.

- Microdeal is selling Clarity 16-bit sound sampler. The software supports
  the standard Amiga sound file formats including the one-, three-and five-
  octave 8SVX/IFF. The 8SVX/IFF file format is limited to eight bits.
  Clarity also supports the AIFF file format for 16-bit samples and the
  proprietary AVR file format. AVR, or Audio Visual Research, is the 
  developer of Clarity. AVR files store complete 16-bit stereo data, 
  including locations for as many as six blocks, in the sample and the
  samples windowing data. There is also a sample sequencer with a capacity
  of up to 300 events. The sequencer provides fine control of the automated
  playback of samples. Sequencer files can be created, edited, saved and
  loaded. Clarity's MIDI mode lets you play samples via the Amiga's 
  keyboard or via a MIDI instrument. The Amiga's keyboard supports up to 10
  samples which can be adjusted over a nine-note range. The MIDI instrument
  supports a seven-octave range. Different samples can be assigned to 
  different ranges of the MIDI instrument. The sample assignments are 
  stored in MIDI Keyboard Map files which can be created, edited, loaded
  and saved. Clarity can also download and uploadith it but "The Edge" 
  will of course have it's own (fast) WB emulation/mode promotion 
  software. It uses 72 pin SIMMs (up to 8 megs via two SIMMs), and will
  retail for ~$299 w/0k RAM.  With video speed equal to the PowerMAC's 
  PDS video board, it is fast. 640x480x32 bit animations in realtime 
  by just moving the data to the board. Up to 80 megapixels per second,
  and the blitter can move entire offscreen bit maps into the viewing 
  area without any glitches in the display. It's also very fasstttt.

- I had a fresh FAX from the Blue Ribbons president concerning their
  continuing support of the Amiga products. Most important points in the
  fax are: "We are loyal to the Amiga platform. All our multiplatform 
  softwares like our "Bars & Pipes professional" are constructed for the
  Amiga first. Then we port our softwares to other platforms. The 
  multitasking nature of the Amiga, makes this computer number 1 source
  for the music and midi. We did a lot of improvments to the Track 
  Window Menu, Edit Window, Song Construction Window, Metronome, 
  printing, Tool and Accessories sections in the version 2.5 of the 
  "Bars & Pipes professional" but the development continues and we are
  designing the next majour update to the "Bars&Pipes". The new version
  will amoung other things support the MacroSystems Toccato"
