<P><FONT SIZE="4"><B>infinitiv disadvantages
</B></FONT> (27-Jun-97
)</P>
<UL>According to Christoph Dahlen, the infinitiv tower system
can't be very reliable. He has got a &quot;normal&quot; A1200 tower system already
and fears that it will explode some day. Even with his 030
he can't play an animation from CD-ROM or hard disk that
doesn't flicker and sometimes stops for tenths of a second.
Copying a 3MB file from CD-ROM or ZIP to hard disk takes nearly
a minute, so there definately has to be something wrong in
this kind of tower system.
He adds that the price of an infinitiv tower system comes
close to the price of an Eagle A4000T without CPU module,
which seems to be a much neater system.

<UL>Olaf Barthel says it appears that all AI/AT licenses seem
to reserve the &quot;right&quot; to sell expensive, not fully working or
even failing to work hardware, which only got a CE approval
because it can't by swallowed by babies. He says that apparently
nobody at AI noticed this yet. Other persons finish developing
hardware that AI should have developed (and sold directly).
Besides that, the infinitiv's tower set doesn't fully emulate
the Z2 bus and therefore expansion card manufacturers will get
additional problems. He finishes his post with the message that
there are many ways to make a platform die, but that ruining the
hardware basis is one of them.

<UL>Index Information Ltd. give some information about their primary
market, the corporate market. <CITE>The retail market is fickle, the buying decision is based on individual
choice at the time of purchase, this tends to make the latest greatest
product sell and causes the sudden collapse of the market or failure of
it to start</CITE>. <CITE>The corporate market buys for different reasons - based on
the requirement and the cost, while there can be a tendency to look at kit
with flashy features there is also the reality that they are not necessary
if all you need is a rolling point of sale display.</CITE> They say they
sold ober 7000 add-ons for the CD32 in the last 2 years, for a corporate
project; while only very few CD32's have been sold to the retail market
in that time. They estimate that <CITE>30-50 per cent of CD32 have ended up in corporate
projects</CITE>. For the corporate market, a 68EC020 with AGA will
be suitable, as it is <CITE>cost effective, compatible,
reliable, functional</CITE>. The future of Index will lie in
<CITE>smaller and more embedded areas as we cost reduce and
shrink the designs with increased R&amp;D man hours and investment</CITE>.
Finally, they point out that there were <CITE>2.4 billion 8 bit micro's sold last year</CITE>,
which is a lot compared to PPC sales they estimated at 3 million.
So eventually, Index <CITE>are aiming at a <STRONG>broader</STRONG> market, not
limiting it to a narrow retail one.</CITE>

They believe that Gateway doesn't feel the same sense of urgency that we
do.<P>
However, one does not create a multi-billion dollar sales machine in a
decade by appearing anxious, nervous, and reactionary. This is a new
ballgame, and Gateway's going to play it their way--professionally, which
has worked pretty well for them to date. So rather than obsessing about
what you perceive as their failings, sit back and let them take care of
business.</BLOCKQUOTE>

about AI's future. <CITE>Don't start guessing and making rumours, continue encouraging
Gateway2000 and Mr Petro Tyschtschenko to provide funding for
1 R&amp;D lead, up to 8 developers, 1 technical support guy and
1 marketing/press officer, plus revive the development process
that would have given us the Walker</CITE>.
<CITE>We need all the help we can get.</CITE>

<UL>Simon Baechler asked Christian Bauer, programmer of ShapeShifter
whether he would do a PPC version. Christian Bauer replied that
a PPC version is not planned because he doesn't have the necessary
time and motivation. He doesn't participate at the PowerUp program
either.

</B></FONT> (07-Jun-97
)</P>
<UL>Terry Coles forwards a text that has been circulating at his work
for several days now. It compares OS to Beers. The Amiga entry
reads as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>AmigaDOS Beer: The company has gone out of business, but their recipe has
been picked up by some weird German company, so now this beer will be an
import. This beer never really sold very well because the original
manufacturer didn't understand marketing. Like UNIX Beer, AmigaDOS Beer fans
are an extremely loyal and loud group. It originally came in a 16 oz. can,
but now it comes in 32 oz. cans too. When this can was originally
introduced, it appeared flashy and colorful, but the design hasn't changed
much over the years, so it appears dated now. Critics of this beer claim
that it is only meant for watching TV anyway.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>Dr. Peter Kittel says that in AT times they <CITE>started a project to investigate the port of the
AA chip technology to modern CMOS</CITE>, and adds that Paula was the
principal problem, less Alice and Lisa. He says this could have lead
to a one-chip version [of the AA chipset], or perhaps it could even
have been intergratable <CITE>with a 68k core on a single chip</CITE>.
Sadly, he doesn't <CITE>know about the last state of that project and whether
it will be continued by GW/AI</CITE>.

<UL>According to Dave Haynie, <CITE>The reason the Amiga can't depend on custom hardware is
the reason very few system house of any kind develop custom hardware
in the personal computer market -- the chip companies do it better, in
vastly higher volumes than any single system house will sell</CITE>.

<UL>The PIOS One is no Mac clone, says Dave Haynie. The architecture
derives from <CITE>PC industry standarts</CITE>. When he started
working on it, it was supposed to run BeOS and <CITE>hopefully
one day</CITE> the AmigaOS, <CITE>MacOS wasn't even an
option at the time</CITE>.
<CITE>The PIOS One is a clone of nothing. I made it up, after researching
the various system components I could get, and chose those that would
build the best system for the least amount of money.</CITE>
He's using two PC clone chips and an Apple-designed chip for I/O, PC style
mouse and keyboards ports; <CITE>not because they're great, because they're not
bad, there's no point in doing it differently</CITE>.
He sums up that he didn't just clone the One, <CITE>when I started, there was
nothing around to clone, even I had wanted to clone something</CITE>.
