    Expect a "Network Computer" from Gateway within the next year or
so. It will have about as much focus and direction as any other network
computer out there (in other words, it will exist on the mere
speculation that someone, somewhere will come up with a use for these
things). Don't expect it to be compatible with old Amiga programs -
especially anything that drives the hardware, it won't be there.
    Actually, IBM knows exactly what it's network computer is for. The
same market as IBM point of sale systems (AKA cash registers),
IBM transaction systems (AKA bank and insurance systems), and IBM
terminals. This is not a flashy market, so is almost unheard of
in hype-filled computer magazines. But it's more than large enough to
sustain a well-done network computer, and IBM has been a leader in it
for a very long time.
    Gateway 2000 has no idea that this market exists. If its 'Network
Computer' (Amiga) succeeds, it will because of it's Amiga-ness, not
its NC-ness, and would probably be a surprise to the company. Unless
Gateway is prepared for something unexpected and can take advantage of
it, then Amiga's remaining life span will barely make it into the next
millenium before being quietly folded up and placed next to the boxes
of unsold EISA cards.
    If it does act properly, the Amiga can maintain a marginal
but profitable existance for the rest of the forseeable future.
