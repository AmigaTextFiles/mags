   It was rewritten to use the operating system routines, albeit in strange
and mysterious ways. The bouncing ball bounces by virtue of changing the
vertical and horizontal position of the display while at the same time the
RasInfo gets patched to keep the the background at the same position. I
polished the code a bit for the "easter egg" section of the Amiga Developer
CD and I can assure you that the RasInfo magic is the only bit of the
program that explores dark and forbidden regions of the OS (not necessarily
the hardware, though). I'd call this "firmware banging" rather than
"hardware banging" ;)
