"Amiga Parody Central is now ending its broadcast day..."

.....beeep........... <CUT TO TEST PATTERN>

<FADE TO BLACK>

<MUSIC>

"Hi, its 4:05 in the am and that means you are watching Perspectives. The
program meant to fulfill Amiga Parody Central's committment to its
community based programming.

Today we are talking to Petro Tyschtschenko, President of the newly aquired
company Amiga International by Gateway 2000.  Petro, do you mind if I call
you Mr. T?"

PT: Ahhh.. no.

"Is it true that you are from Germany?"

PT: Ahh.. yes.

"And you flew all the way here, to be on my show."

PT: That is correct, you asked me to come.

"It is now 4:06 in the am, we are talking to Mr. T who is from Germany. He
flew here especially to be on my show but I cannot recall inviting him.
Mr. T. is the president of Amiga International, a company purchased by
Gateway 2000.

So Petro, what brings you here today to talk about?"

PT: Well, our company, Amiga International was just bought by the PC clone
    maker Gateway 2000 from here in the US and I wanted to spread the good news
    about the Amiga's bright future.

"What exactly is this Amiga?"

PT: It is a 32 bit, multitasking computer.

"And what exactly does the name Amiga mean?"

PT: Actually it was chosen because it means "friend".  To be more precise
    it means girl friend in Spanish.

"If you are just joining us, I am talking to Petro Tyschtschenko, Mr. T. for
short.  He is President of Amiga International in Germany, a computer
making company that was recently bought out by Gateway 2000, a US based
company that makes PC clones. Petro is accompanied here today by his
spanish girlfriend. It is now 4:07 in the am."

PT: Actually, it is not my spanish girlfriend.

"Right.

So Mr. T, you mentioned that Gateway 2000 makes PC clones? Why clones? Are
they like that identical sheep they made over in Scotland?"

PT: No, they are computers, based on the old IBM design.

"So there is no sheep involved?"

PT: No.

"And who exactly is IBM and where do they fit into this picture?"

PT: Are you serious? Where have you been for the past 20 years?

"You mean I missed something?"

PT: And when do I get to outline the future of the Amiga?

"Hi.. it is now 4:08 in the am. You are watching Perspectives. My guest
today is Mr. P. T., a German who owns a computer making company bought out
by a US sheep cloning company known as Gateway 2000. These are special
sheep, some are spanish.. rumour has it one of them is Petro's girlfriend."

PT: This is ridiculous.

"I think you having a sheep for a girlfriend is ridiculous!"

PT: There is no sheep involved, they are not my girlfriends. If you want to
    talk about any kind of animals related to computers, it should be cows
    - they are Gateway 2000's mascot.

"Interesting."

PT: Yes, as I was saying.  The future for the Amiga is bright.. we are
    exploring new ways to make the machine cheaper and bring it up to spec as
    quickly as possible!

"Moooo!"

PT: Mooo?

"Sorry, I was just trying out for a second job.. that of being a mascot."

PT: Can we proceed? What time is it? This seems like it is taking forever.

"It is 4:09 in the am. This is Perspectives, the community based program
helping the Amiga Parody Central fulfill its license agreement. My guest
today is Petro T. He makes computers in Germany with the aid of sheep, some
of which he likes to date. His mother company is Gateway 2000 - they prefer
cows and have been trying to imitate IBM for the past 20 years by buying
out cheap, bright, bankrupt companies."

PT: That's it.. I am leaving! I'm off to Atlanta!

<MUSIC>

"Well that ends Perspectives for tonight. Thanks for watching. Tune in next
week when we will have as a guest Bill Gateway, or is that Gates? He is the
owner of Microsoft, a strange company whose main goal in life is to clean
every Window on every building in the world."
