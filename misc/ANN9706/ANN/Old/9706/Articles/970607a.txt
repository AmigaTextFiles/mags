  Hi,

  Posting im Auftrag von Andreas.

 Announcement: SuperView goes powerUP (TM)
 *****************************************

    Optional PPC plugin modules available for
    SViewNg V7.00 plus -Library V17.1 (26.5.97) !


    Concept
    -------
    The most time-consuming routines of certain modules of SuperView-Library
    have been ported to native PowerPC code and perhaps will profit a lot
    from the presence of an installed powerUP system.

    These "native modules" are located in a new subdirectory of LIBS:
    called "svppc/", with subdirectories for each of SuperView-Library's
    module types.

    If any "native modules" are present, these will be used whenever applicable.
    Should none of these modules be available, then this does not matter, since
    the plain 68k code (which may be optimized for a certain 68k CPU, though)
    will be used instead (fallback option).

    Note, that SuperView-Library's native modules won't replace any of the
    existing libraries or modules as such - they 'only' do supply specialized
    plugin modules in native code for certain tasks.

    You can expect high speed increases with most basic operations, especially
    when internal, often used and time-intensive routines do take place.


    Availability
    ------------
    More than 20 modules are made available in a special powerUP PPC plugin
    module package, which e.g. can be bought by registered SuperView/SViewNG
    users or will be included with some commercial programs (not on Aminet).

    Also, there will follow some PPC modules, which will only be available
    for exclusive shipment with some commercial programs (as also are the
    concerned SV modules).

    For details, see gfx/misc/SViewNG.lha on Aminet.
