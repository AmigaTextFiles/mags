Subject ........: MicroSoft to sell back Amiga software

this concerns blue ribbon software...Bars&Pipes Super Jam....
this is a follow up to my original post about this item.
after seeing some of the responses in usenet i thought
i'd post a few of the blunt details, answer and ask a few
questions.

After 3 months of e-mail with the person at microsoft
who was responsible for the blue ribbon aquisition,
he has made it clear that MS has no interest or intention
of any or further developement of blue ribbon products.
as far as they are concerned, it's not worth their effort.

He has agreed to receive an offer to buy the property,
license and code from any interested established bidder.
he also makes it clear that it would take a minimum of
1 million US$ to cause a sale to proceed.

one of my bargain points was the port of products to NT
and maybe MAC. this revenue could support development for cheaper
amiga versions.

Sadly i think that there is not one million US$ to be spared
in the whole amiga world right now. but if you could prove me
wrong, i would be a very happy amiga user.

Some one mentioned that MS doesn't own the blue ribbon library...
they do.

Some said MS did a windows version of B&P.
they didn't, but i think blue ribbon was working on a beta
before they died. no windows version was officially released.
other blue ribbon programs were ported though. if you have
a windows copy i'd like to get a look at it please.

I e-mailed amiga inc. about this, but no reply. my first post
drew comments from loyal users, but no possible buyer. (not surprising)

a person at Anti Gravity told me they wouldn't give $10,000 US$ for it.

an ex-Sunrise engineer who worked on the AD1012 and AD516 that worked
so well and closely with the B&P program for HD recording, says he and
the old boss are not interested in continuing any support. they are busy
with other things and are also not interested in letting some one else
buy their copyright and code to continue work.

any one have any good news? i guess i'll contact the group working on
Dominator sequencer and see if they need another c-coder and tech.
