Die bisher IMO beste Auflistung:

                    Amiga system startup test routines

Amiga system test is a complicated set of routines which it must go through
before you can do any work on it.  During the system test the Amiga is
attempting to let you know if the system is well.  Here is a list of the
start-up activities:

  1. Clear all chips of old data (screen turns blue on custom chip error)
  2. Disable DMA and interrupts during the test
  3. Clear the screen
  4. Check the hardware ....checks to see if 68000 is functioning
  5. Change screen color (dark grey)
  6. Do a checksum test on all ROMS
  7. Change screen color (display "Insert KickStart" screen)
  8. Begining of system startup
  9. Check RAM at $C0000,and move SYSBASE there
 10. Test All CHIP RAM
 11. Change screen color (green if bad RAM)
 12. Check that software is coming in ok
 13. Change screen color (light grey)
 14. Setup CHIP RAM to receive data
 15. Link the libraries
 16. Check for additional memory and link it
 17. Turn the DMA and interrupts back on
 18. Start a default task
 19. Check for 680x0 and or 6888x
 20. Check for Exception (processor error) (screen yellow if found and 
     GURU handler not yet set up)
 21. System Reset (screen white)

During this system test the Amiga is sending vital information to the
screen with colors.  If the system checks out ok, you will see the
following sequence that you have seen so many times.

DARK GRAY:  The initial hardware tested OK. the 680x0 is running
            and the registers are readable.

LIGHT GRAY: The software is coming in and seems OK.

WHITE:      The intialization test have passed.

If something is wrong with your system, you may see the following:

 RED:    If an error was found in ROMS.
 GREEN:  Error found in the CHIP RAM.
 BLUE:   Error was found in the custom chips.
 YELLOW: If 680x0 found an error before the error trapping software
         (system failure) was running.
