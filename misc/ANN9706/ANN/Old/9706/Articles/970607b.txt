My private list :

- Imagine 6.0
- superview.library (speedup of 1000% on Developper PPC Board, 1000%, not 
  100% !!! In comparision to a 50 MHz 060 !!!)
- CyberGraphX (Shipping with PowerUP)
- CyberGL (Shipping with PowerUP)
- Iris MPEG Player (Shipping with PowerUP)
- Art Effect 2.0 Graphics Software
- StormC and StormPowerASM (or what it was called)
- Picture Manager, AFAIK (uses also superview.library, BTW)
- PPaint
- Fusion Mac Emulator quite sure
- Rumours: PCX and PC-Task PC Emulators
- The MPEG Audio Encode Software on Aminet
- Reflections 4.1 (also uses CyberGL)
- Myst (Game by ClickBOOM)
- All future games by ClickBOOM, there soon will be also PowerPC-only-titles
  in developpement, under them probably Quake
- Probably all software done by Haage&Partner
- more comes to the list every day...

> And will pOS be available for/compatible with P5 PowerUp cards?

Probably not, but still possible. But do not give your breath to p-OS. Phase 5 
will do the next generation AmigaDOS (AFAIK this will be done in porting the 
AmigaDOS libraries to PowerPC Native using StormC which supports creating 
PowerPC Native Libs). And in the meanwhile a LOT of special software for 
PowerUP appears (which will be compatible with the future AmigaDOS).

If you need more PowerUP info, please mail me.
