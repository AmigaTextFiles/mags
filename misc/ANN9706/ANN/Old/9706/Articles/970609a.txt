   Don't start guessing and making rumours, continue encouraging
Gateway2000 and Mr Petro Tyschtschenko to provide funding for
1 R&D lead, up to 8 developers, 1 technical support guy and
1 marketing/press officer, plus revive the development process
that would have given us the Walker (no, I don't want to discuss
how the casing looked like and whether it was such a brilliant
idea to go with the 68EC030). We need all the help we can get.
