It is based on the A1200, but comes with ZorroII/III slots, PCI and ISA slots.
It also has a A3000/4000 type CPU slot as well as the A1200 expansion slot.
There was no mentioning the PCMCIA slot, so maybe this is removed
Don't remember it it has a videoslot, but it would'nt surprice me....
This could be the most expandable Amiga ever seen.

There was something mentioned about MAC/PC compability, but it was in german so
I didn't quite get it.
