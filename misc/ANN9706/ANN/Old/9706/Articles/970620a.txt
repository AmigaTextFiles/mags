I visited #amiga_warez, where the sCenE meets, and they were of the
opinion that shareware authors were greedy because they wanted
money for their voluntary work. I have powered hundreds of hours work
into FFNews (just to give an example), and what I got back was... maybe
for 20 or 30 hours. 

I find it absolutely weird to say Shareware Authors would be greedy or
suck blood from the poor poor Amiga community.
