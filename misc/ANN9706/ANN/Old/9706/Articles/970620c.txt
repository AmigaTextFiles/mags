Subject ........: Why you should be patient.

A lot of people are worried about what Gateway's not saying.  They feel
that they are being ignored, or at the very least not being looked after.
They believe that Gateway doesn't feel the same sense of urgency that we
do.

However, one does not create a multi-billion dollar sales machine in a
decade by appearing anxious, nervous, and reactionary.  This is a new
ballgame, and Gateway's going to play it their way--professionally, which
has worked pretty well for them to date.  So rather than obsessing about
what you perceive as their failings, sit back and let them take care of
business.
