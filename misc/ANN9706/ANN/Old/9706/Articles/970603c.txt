That is false. The PIOS One architecture, if anything, derives from PC
industry standards. Other than the PowerPC (and since the Amiga and
original Mac have the 68K, you can't even argue this one), there's
nothing more or less Mac architected  in the PIOS One than in the
Amiga. When I started the design last fall, I was planning to run the
BeOS and, hopefully one day, the AmigaOS. The MacOS wasn't even an
option at the time.

Well, the Amiga runs the MacOS today. The PIOS One does not at this
moment. Both of these things reflect the fact that it's really a
matter of being clever, or getting Apple's permission, to run the
MacOS. Machine architecture has little to do with it. In fact, the
whole CHRP idea was started to move away from the proprietary PowerMac
architecture., which is the common thread in every Mac Clone.

The PIOS One is a clone of nothing. I made it up, after researching
the various system components I could get, and chose those that would
build the best system for the least amount of money. Sure, there are
limits to this, based on the fact that we are using PowerPC, we are
using the PCI bus, etc. Part of the design is even using the ISA bus,
because just like on the BeBox, that has been where cheap peripheral
chips live. 

I'm using two PClone industry system chips, which deliver EIDE,
floppy, RS-232 serial, IEEE1284 parallel, USB, etc. You won't find
anything like these in PowerMacs. One of the glue chips is pretty
common on PC Clone motherboards, it's in the Intel PX430, HX430, and
VX430 chipsets. I'm hardly married to it, but it's much better at EIDE
than anything in a Mac (because, of course, PCs rely on this, Apple
treats it as a necessary evil). I have PC style mouse and keyboard
ports, PC style clock. Not because they're great, because they're not
bad, there's no point in doing it differently. Floppies don't matter
that much anymore. PC keyboard and mouse will be eclipsed by USB in a
few years. The parallel port is as fast as they get, better than the
Amiga's, much less the nonexistant MacClone parallel ports.

Yeah, I'm using an Apple designed Super I/O in there too. It was
simple to accept: it meant free SCSI, and CHRP compliance. But it has
only a small effect on the system architecture. It does support the
OpenPIC standard for advanced interrupt control, rather than the
BeBox-like controller I had designed myself. This is a good thing, and
not a PowerMac thing, an open standard invented by AMD and Cyrix to
combat some of the multiprocessor things Intel was doing awhile back.
Good stuff, very extensible, supports multiprocessing, well thought
out all over. The SCSI isn't bad, better than A3000 SCSI, not quite as
good as A4000T SCSI, but hell, it's a freebie. The two RS-422 ports in
this chip replaced the two extra RS-232s I had, and since they're way
faster, and RS-422 is quite useful in video and music applications,
also a good thing. You could drop this chip into a PC and get the same
features, that wouldn't make the PC a Mac Clone any more than it makes
the PIOS One a Mac Clone. It would work on any PCI slot grafted onto
an Amiga, for that matter.

Not necessarily. To be a clone, there's a process, "cloning", copying,
etc. involved. When I started, there was nothing around to clone, even
if I had wanted to clone something. I took some queues from my old
Acutiator Architecture from C=, and some things I thought were done
well in the BeBox. Apple's PowerMacs started as upgrades of their
68040 architectures, and grew from there in entirely different
directions. Presumably, they'll move those ideas into something CHRP
compliant at some point -- they're apparently getting closer anyway,
obviously they do understand the goal, even if publically they keep
hedging on it. Motorola has done two fairly independent CHRP designs
in-house, one in the computer group, one in the chip group (that
latter, now on the Motorola web site, is the "YellowKnife" design).
This one was evolved from the PReP architecture, which also used
standard PC components. IBM did a similar thing with their LongTrail
system, yet a different CHRP implementation that grew in some way out
of PReP.

The important thing to realize about CHRP is that it isn't the PC
Clone all over again in a PowerPC overcoat. There's much, much less in
CHRP that is specific to any particular hardware implementation. Most
of the simple details are managed by the RTAS (RunTime Abstraction
Services) layer, basically a small HAL Beyond that, device support
in-ROM is written under Open Firmware, which makes it not only MacOS
independent, but CPU independent. 

By the way, the PIOS One motherboard is also CPU independent.

All I see is fog. The notion of a Mac Clone will gradually be replaced
by the notion of a CHRP machine. Clones are a bad idea, period. The PC
market pretty much proves this -- there's little a system company can
do to innovate, beyond making a different case style, bundling better
software, or dropping the price. This is what lets Intel and Microsoft
call all the shots. We'll have a better environment for innovation on
the CHRP platform, assuming Apple doesn't manage to kill the PowerPC
before CHRP can survive MacOS-free if necessary.

Not that I want this; I think the MacOS could be great again if Apple
lets it. But they're still calling from the Commodore playbook. While
it's not something folks talk about alot, Commodore's ultimate death
at the hands of morons like Ali and Sydnes was as much effect as cause
-- it's kind of like dying from cancer because you've got AIDS or
something. The sickness was always management, and before Engineering
was ever affected by such lunacy, upper management looked very much,
at least to the outside world, like bunch of lunatics. This hit home
-- companies didn't buy the Amiga, didn't develop for the Amiga,
because of this. They simply didn't want to bet a significant amount
of resources on someone like Gould doing the right thing. This is what
ate into the company and started the downward spiral that concluded
with Ali. I don't believe the damage was irreversible before Ali took
over, but it would have been hard-fought at best.

Now look at Apple. Without making any single great killer mistake
(which they have, if they're losing 900 million a year, but I don't
know all the details so I won't get into that), they're killing
themselves. They're doing it simply by being nuts. Every major
business and half the Mac faithful know why Mac compatibles are
necessary, whatever you call them. These guys are getting bent out of
shape by Apple's on-again, off-again CHRP support, not to mention the
other crazy stuff, like Copland, no NeXTStep; on-again/off-again new
technologies that never deliver, etc. They are losing confidence in
Apple, and will not be as likely to make the same serious monetary
investments in Apple that they have in the past if this craziness
continues. And based on Jobs' latest diatribes against clones (man,
has that guy lost touch, assuming he ever really had it), this may
never happen. 

Like it or hate it, the loss of Apple, or the MacOS, as a viable
general purpose computing platform would hurt us all.
