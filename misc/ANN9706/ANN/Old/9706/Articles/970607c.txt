Well, what is it what current PC chips can't do: It boils down to
Copper functionality, i.e. raster synchronized activities. But there
are SVGA chips that provide vertical and also horizontal blank
interrupts, thus synchronization down to line level. So with these
chips you could also do draggable screens, just with a normal interrupt
routine instead of the Copper updating the chip registers. The only
problem is, the chips do support those functions (at least some of
them), but the cards or the computers they are used in not. This is
one of the issues we are investigating when choosing a gfx card, that
we perhaps find one supporting these functions.

So again, with a horizontal blank interrupt, you can get raster
synchronized action with a granularity of whole lines, where the
Amiga Copper offers a finer granularity of about 4 pixels in low-res
IIRC. So there would not be much loss compared to an original Amiga.

All other functions of the Amiga custom chipsets are "normal" and
also available from common gfx or sound or IO control chips.

Well, it serves also as an interrupt controller, but that is achievable
today with other chips just as well.

Yes, it is good when a programmer can rely on a certain basic, standard
functionality in the hardware. On a PC, the basic VGA video mode is the
comparable least common denominator. But the downside of this was that
it also encouraged the programmers to bang this hardware directly, a
method that was discouraged e.g. on Macs, so the Mac has more software
which behaves decent and causes relatively few compatibility problems.

Well, in AT times we started a project to investigate the port of the
AA chip technology to modern CMOS (Paula was the principal problem here,
less Alice and Lisa), perhaps leading to a one-chip version, perhaps
even integratable with a 68k core on one single chip, a single-chip
Amiga. I don't know about the last state of that project and whether
it will be continued by GW/AI.
