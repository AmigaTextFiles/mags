Them  were   the   days,    the   C64,
squeeling  away,   sending  subliminal
messages  while games load...   I  was
only  about 8 or 9 at the  time,   and
for a while I was getting bored of  my
multi-hundred   games..    But    hey,
couldn't be helped!

My  brother  was in the  Army  at  the
time,  and when he was on leave  about
1996,   he bought himself a brand  new
A500+ (@4kickstart 2.04,  1MB RAM@5)   and
this  was  one of the first  A500+  to
reach  Irvine   stores  (@4yes,   Im  an
Irvine  Blackneck,  as plod  puts  it@5)
That  day I can recall me runnig  home
from  secondary  school  to  see  this



thing go..

Got home,  there is was,  plugged into
the  big telly..  and what was on  the
screen,  but bliss!! @3 Monkey Island 2!@5
and  the  whole family was interacting
with  the game!!  I already  had  this
@1"technical  mind"@5 and  was  outstanded
with the graphics,  music,  smoothness
and resoulution..

Anyway,   cut  the boring  blah,   two
years  had  passed,  and I managed  to
aquire   his   A500+   as   he   didnt
really have much time for it,  and  he
was  fed up of me asking him to  bring
it  home  everytime he was on leave...
now  I said aquire,  he actually  left
it inthe cupboard upstairs,  and never
told me for a while.. @1 "an Amiga,   in
my cupboard, and I never even knew!!"@5

And there is starts,  my Amiga life in
1991!!   and  what a blessing  is  has
been..  Many years I went through with
this @1 "beige bitch"@5 she was  faithful,
multitasked   and   filled   my  every
fantasty  (@4come on,  I  was  pre-teen@5)
The  amount of things I could do  with
her    was   amazing   (@4 Amiga   means
Girlfriend  in  spannish,   do  I  get
the 10 blank disks@1 =o) @5 )   Not  only
was  I  the  main source of new  games
(@4tisk tick@5)  but  I also used  her for
serious stuff too!

Ok,  ok,  Im dribbling again, but come
on,   Amiga /commodore   was   a   big
influence on part my life  (@4sad,   but
true@5)

Right..  now year 2000 (@4has your clock
crashed  yet@5)  and I  have  my  A1260T
keeping my feet up and god bless  her!
I  bought  a  basic  1200  020  2MB  a

Seagate  525MB HD for  £350  in  1997,
maybe  a  bit  too much,   but  I  was
desperate for a 1200!!

So for tha past so many years,  I have
seen  Amiga be revived so many times..
I  have lost alot of Amiga friends,  I
have  join  Ayrshire Amiga  clubs,   I
have made money,  lost money,  I  have
built,   expanded and like  every  one
else,   blew a few serial chips,   but
hey..     Look,    Im   still    Amiga
orientated.....  and to make this come
to  an end,  coz I am being distracted
by my girlfriend..
@5
I  have had three PCs in the past  two
years,   given or bought..  Where  are
they??  yeah,  where they  should  be,
@1oot  mah  hoose!@5  I have not time  for
windoesnot,  its pathetic,   and  aint
all that use to me anyway..  So why am
I still with Amiga then??
@7
