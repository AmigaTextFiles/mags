     Hi Gang! Welcome to this the second edition of the@4 G.A.U.G Gazette@5.

Well  after  a  long debate by group members@1 Issue 1@5 of the@4 Gazette@5  finally
arrived in a@1 DMS@5 file format, Uploaded to the Group Web Page.

I  have received several mails from various members,  containing compliments
regarding the look of the issue and several suggestions for improvement both
in Quantity and Quality. I thank everyone who kindly responded.

So what does the second issue contain?@1 .... @5 Well we have a welcome and best
wishes  message  from  a Member of@3 AMIGA INC@5.  A special  Guest  Writer  and
several articles supplied be some of the Group@1 (Including Screenshots)@5.

I  Hearty  thanks  to all who sent in articles @1...@5  All were  of  very  high
Quality@1 ...@5 For all those who have not yet put@3 "Pen to Paper"@5 or should that
be@3 "Fingers to Keyboard"@1 ... @5 Lets get something done for the next Issue, We
are  not  looking  for Professional Quality journalism,   and  no  one  will
Ridicule your efforts@1 (They will be to busy reading their own#2 :@1)
@5
One of the group suggested sending the@4 Gazette@5 into the AmigActive!  and yes
this  is  an Idea@1 ....@5However I feel prior to that we would really  have  to
have an issue containing a LOT MORE members contributions To let people see
that  the  group  use  the  Publication for various  tasks  like  Tutorials,
Advertising etc.

However do feel free to copy this disk, and send it to as many people as you
want, Give a copy to any Amiga contacts that you have. Spreading the word of
@4G.A.U.G@5 can only be a benefit to the User Group. I myself have mailed a copy
to Germany, and Issue 1 has been viewed by@3 Petro@1 (Mr Amiga Himself)@5 and the
Staff of@2 Haage & Partners@1 (and been very well received)@5.

I  am  also running an Advertising section for the Group in the next edition
of  The@2 RIPPER@5 Magazine @1(issue11)@5  and hope that it gains some interest from
Amiga users outwith the Glasgow area.

Please remember that this publication is#8 YOUR NEWSLETTER@1 ...@5Feel free to use
the  pages to place Adverts @1(For sale or Wanted)  ...@5Have your say regarding
the Amiga and new development, Or indeed any other subject that you feel may
be of interest to other Members.
