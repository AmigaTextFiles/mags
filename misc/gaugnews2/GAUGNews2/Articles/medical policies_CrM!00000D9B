                                  SICKNESS:@5

We  will no longer accept a doctor's statement as proof of sickness.  if you
are able to go to the doctor, you are able to come to work.
@3
                                 OPERATIONS:@5

Operations are now banned.  As long as you are an employee here,   you  need
all that you have.  You should not consider removing anything.  We hired you
intact. To have something removed constitutes a breach of employment.

                               DEATH OF OTHERS:@5

This  is  no excuse for missing work.  There is nothing you can do for  dead
friends,  relatives or coworkers.  Every effort should be made to have  non-
employees  attend  to  the  arrangements.  In rare  cases,   where  employee
involvement  is  necessary,  the funeral should be  scheduled  in  the  late
afternoon or early morning according to the shift you work.  We will be glad
to  allow  you to work through your lunch time and subsequently leave  early
provided  your  share of the work is enough to keep the job  going  in  your
absence.
@3
                               YOUR OWN DEATH:@5

This will be accepted as an excuse.  However,  we require at least two weeks
notice as it is your duty to train your replacement.

                                REST ROOM USE:@5

Entirely too much time is being spent in the rest room.  In the future,   we
will  follow  the  practice of going in alphabetical order.   For  instance,
those whose names begin with 'A' will go from 8:00 to 8:10,  employees whose
names  begin with 'B' will go from 8:10 to 8:20 and so on.  If you're unable
to  go  at your time,  it will be necessary to wait until the next day  when
your time comes again.  In extreme emergencies employees may swap their time
with  a  co-worker.   This  exchange must be  approved  by  both  employee's
supervisors.
