                             Missing Money Riddle@1
                            ----------------------  


@3
Three  young  Friends had just moved into a new Flat,  Which was  only  Part
Furnished.  Soon afterwards they Became bored and decided to go for a  Walk.
While wandering down the City Streets they came upon a SecondHand Shop,  And
in the Window was a T.V. with the Sales tag for £30.@6

One lad turned to his Friends and said@4 " Hey! If we all club together, £10
Each we could buy the T.V.  for the flat " @6 His friends agreed to this and
they  all  put £10 into a Kitty and went into the Shop and asked the  Female
Assistant for the T.V.  They then paid the Money and Happily left  the  Shop
with their Purchase.!@5

Shortly after they had left the Shop the Assistant Suddenly remembered  that
the  T.V.  Was actually on Special Offer,  And the correct Price should have
been  £25.   Hurriedly she Grabbed 5 Pound Coins and  ran  after  the  Three
Friends.




@1
Just  before She caught up with the Boys,  She Suddenly thought  to  herself
@6"  I  can't split 5 Pound coins Between 3 People? and being in a low  paid
Job, Decided to make matters a bit easier, And put £2 in her own pocket"@3

When  she caught up with the Three Boys she Apoligised,  That she  had  over
charged them for the T.V. and gave them each, Back a Pound coin!

When she had left,  The three Friends Smiled and said@4 " Hey! This is great
the T.V. only cost us £9 Each!"

@7The  problem is If the T.V.  cost them £9 Each (=£27)  and  the  Assistant
Pocketed £2 that comes to only £29#8

                       SO WHERE DID THE OTHER POUND GO@1

                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@4
Well!   how  did  you  do with this one? The answer is actually  very  easy,
However Difficult to explain.  It is of course a PLAY on words, Or in simple
terms the riddle confuses you into thinking that some money is missing, When
in fact it isn't
The  3  friends paid out a total of £27 this in fact@1 INCLUDES@4 the  £2.00
that  the  shop  assistant put in her pocket!  Again the till  in  the  shop
contains  £25 of the Students money,  And the assistant has a further  £2.00
=£27  It  is totally wrong to add this £2.00 back on to the Money  that  the
Students Spent
      
The total break down of the money@1 SHOULD@4 read
@3
                             Shop till Holding  £25
                             Assistant Holding  £2
                             Refund to students £3
                                  Total         £30
