@3
There  is  a  problem with stowage at the venue,  this needs to be  resolved
also the A1200 Jim Merrilees was to donate does not work perhaps we can  fix
it though.

@5           
                                  Treasurer@1

@3
The website is progressing nicely with the newsletter available for download
Members are reminded to vote on their favorite logo either via the  poll  on
onelist  or by to mail Duncan To allow a main logo to be selected.   Due  to
problems  accessing  the  polls the deadline has been  extended  until  next
meeting.   Unfortunately Francis has to retire from his  role  as  assistant
webmaster  due  to other commitments any volunteers for this  position  mail
Duncan.  Permenant website/redirection Donald at the moment has the  website
on his freeserve webspace but another location will be investigated and also
a redirection provider so we can have a sensible url.

@5           
                          Trip to Kickstart 27/5/00@1
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@3
Although people would have liked to go the general consensus was  that  they
would  rather  wait until WOA as £100 to get to Kickstart  would  be  better
saved until then.




@5
                                 Consitution@1
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~
@3
Spokesperson  stated he had the consitution but had yet  to  finish  it  but
hopes to for the next meeting.

@5
Unfortunately  there were only 2 amigas at the meet @1(1 only  could  be  used
due to a forgotten power supply)@5.  The logos were displayed eventually by  a
long winded process on the PC in the corner.  And Jim Markey discovered that
he had a hard drive in his A1200.
@4
           
                        Any comments to Duncan please.
