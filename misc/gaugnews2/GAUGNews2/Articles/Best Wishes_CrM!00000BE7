                              Hello To G.A.U.G!*2@1
                              =================
@5
I  see  lots  of  discussion about@1 "what is an Amiga"@5.  There  are  as  many
answers  as  there are users,  but of one thing we can be sure,  only  Amiga
users could possibly get so much done in such a short amount of time!

I  am continually amazed when I hear of the amount of effort Amiga users put
into  keeping  the Amiga alive and helping other users.  Your  group  is  no
exception! What a job you all have done in just two short months of time!
@4
                 Congratulations from@1 Amiga Inc.@4 to you all!

As I am sure you know by now,  Mr Bill McEwen managed to purchase the rights
and licenses to all Amiga technology from Gateway Computers back in January.

Also,  in a short amount of time, he has hired over 50 Amiga users on staff.
We have specced out a developer box,  partnered with Tao in the UK for using
their  Elate/Intent  operating   system  to  build  a  brand  new  operating
environment for a new Amiga which will be hardware independent and  scalable
so that it will work on everything from hand helds to servers.

Our developer,  user,  and user group support sites will be up sometime this
month.   And  we also will be releasing a developer box and a  developer  cd
soon.

For  the people who may tell you or who may write in various forums that  we
are  not building a@3 "real"@5 Amiga,  I can assure you that all of us on  staff
with  Amiga Inc.  are Amiga users and have been@1 (in most cases)@5   since  the
very  first  A1000's  were  out.  Most of us  were  involved  with  the  old
@4Commodore Vic-20,@5 the@4 C64@5 and@4 C128@5 as well.

For  us,   this  is  about Amigans building a new Amiga based  on  the  same
concepts and principles that the Classic Amiga has always had.  And we  know
we  can  not  accomplish our goals without the support of user  groups  like
yours.

I  have  passed on to]5@3 Bill McEwen]1@5 the hard work you guys@1 (and gals?)@5   have
done in Glasgow and he@1 (and we all)@5 wish the best of success to you!

Once  your web pages are complete,  please email@1 Kari@5 about getting approval
to  use our@2 User Group Seal of Approval@5 on your web site!  You can find  the
seal at@1 http://www.amiga.com@5 We would be proud to have your support!
