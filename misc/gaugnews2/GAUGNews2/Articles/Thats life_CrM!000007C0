The  room  was  full of pregnant women and their partners,  and  the  Lamaze
class was in full swing.

The  instructor was teaching the women how to breathe properly,  along  with
informing the men how to give the necessary assurances at this stage of  the
plan.

The teacher then announced, @3 "Ladies,  exercise is good for you.  Walking is
especially beneficial.  And,  gentlemen,  it wouldn't hurt you to  take  the
time to go walking with your partner!"
@4
The room really got quiet.  Finally, a man in the middle of the group raised
his hand.@3 "Yes?"@4 replied the teacher...
@5
          "Is it all right if she carries a golf bag while we walk?"
