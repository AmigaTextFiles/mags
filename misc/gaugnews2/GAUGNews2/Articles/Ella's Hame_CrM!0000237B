you  ever drink in the #8 PISTON BROKE,@5 You don't EVER leave an unfinished
drink  at the bar,  Cause when yea get back,  Some Bastard's off we it!   So

              "KIN YEA MAKE ONE FUR ME?"@5 I replied, But the Bugger

              jist laughed! So I thought tae masel, Am oot o here

              afore he starts tae shake this thing, Or I'll end

              up we whiplash or something!

              So I returns tae the bar, and whit did I find on the

              "AM AFF TAE MA BED, GOOD NIGHT!"@5 and off I went.

About  seven the next morning,  I awoke and noticed a strange smell  in  the
air! Now it wiznae Ella, She only Farts when she's been eating Cabbage! So I
Jumped oot o bed and quickly Slips Ella's@1 PINK,  FLORAL DRESSING GOWN@5,  over
the  top o ma Pyjama's Retrieved ma Bonnet from the bedpost and started  off
down the stairs.

As  I  reached the living room door,  I couldn't help notice the thick black
smoke!  And there wiz Ella's Mither lying on the floor! Trying tae light the
Ornamental coals on the gas fire!
@2
             "OH FUR CHRIST SAKE! ELLA! QUICK GET UP, YER BLUDDY

                     MITHER HIZ SET FIRE TAE THE HOOSE!"
@5
Having  alerted the wife!  I ran into the living room grabbed the Auld  Bint
by the Ankles and ran HELL for Leather,  Along the hall, oot the front door,
along the landing, Doon two flights o stairs and oot on tae the Street!

Now  Am  no an Emotional Man!  But there wiz something Comforting aboot  the
sound of that#8 SILLY AULD CRONES HEID@5 Stottin aft the Concrete steps!

Well as luck would have it,  One of the neighbours hid noticed the smoke and
alerted the Fire Brigade, So they Arrived in Minutes!

Three o them jumped oot o the engine,  Axes drawn,  Hose in hand and ran  up
the  stair  tae ma bonny hoose!  I Accompanied the Fire chief up the  stair,
And#8 LOW@3 and #8BEHOLD@3 ther wiz one o his boys,  Whacking the shit oot o
ma  front door we his axe!  Now I wouldna mind,  But The#8 BLUDDY THING  WIZ
OPEN!
@1
           "OH! FORGET HIM!"@3 says the fire chief@1 " HE's A GURKA

             YOU KEN THEIR TYPE, ONCE THEY DRAW IT, THEY HAVE TAE

                                   USE IT!"
@5
            Well the other two came oot an said@3 "That's it oot"
@5
and  we  arrived  doonstair jist in time to see a  medic  bending  over  the
MITHER  IN  LAW,   tae gie hur resuscitation His mouth was jist  approaching
hers,   When  her  knee came up sharply and gave him a hefty  whack  in  the
Knackers!
@4
           "KEEP YER BLUDDY HAN'S TAE YERSEL, YE YOUNG PERVERT YE!"
@5
She  yells!   As  the Medic rolls along the Pavement clutching  his#8  CROWN
JEWLS@5 in both hands! @4

           "CHIRST ARE YE NAE SAFE IN THE STREETS O GLASGA ANYMAIR?

           KIN YE NAE LIE OAN THE PAVEMENT WITHOOT GETTING GRAPED?"
@5
She screams.  As Ella drags her Mither aff this poor man,  She gets one mair
Kick  in!   And the Poor bloke is loaded onto his Ain Stretcher  and  carted
away!

The  3 o us return tae the Hoose,  and survey the Damage!  A Charred lump  o
burnt  Plastic lay in the Fire Hearth,  The walls and Ceiling were Blackened
wie  the Smoke,  And as we stood there a Sheet o Wallpaper flopped  off  the
Wall and landed at oor feet in a Soggy Lump!  Then I looked to my left!   At
an empty space where the T.V.  Used to be,  And a big hole in the livingroom
Windae!
@2
            "AH FUR CHRIST SAKE! NAY THE TELLY!"@3 I screams, But

YES!   The force o the water from the Firemens hose Hud ricocheted  off  the
wall and blasted the T.V. oot o the Bluddy Windae!

A  quick  glance oot oh the broken glass confirmed it!  There wiz  ma  telly
lying in a thousand bits, 2 floors doon in next door's Midden!
@4
           " HUV YE NO COMPLAINED TO THE COUNCIL, ABOOT THIS DAMP?"
@5
                Says the Mither in Law, looking at the wall,@4

         "IT WOULDNAE BE ME, LIVING IN THESE CONDITIONS!"@5 She says.

         Then with oot a care in the world, She turns ta me and Says

              @4 " KIN YE GET A WEE SHOVEL O COAL FUR THE FIRE?

                         BOABY! MA LEGS ARE FREEZIN!"
             @2
