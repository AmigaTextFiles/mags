  The Lunar Landing...The true Story*2@1
  ==================================
@4  
On July 20,  1969, as commander of the
Apollo   11   Lunar   Module,     Neil
Armstrong was the first person to  set
foot  on  the  moon.  His first  words
after  stepping on the moon,  @3 "That's
one  small step for a man,  one  giant
leap  for mankind,"@4 were televised  to
Earth and heard by millions.

But  just  before   he re-entered  the
lander,  he made the enigmatic remark,
@3"Good luck, Mr. Gorsky."
@4
Many people at@1 NASA@4 thought it  was  a
casual  remark concerning  some  rival
Soviet   Cosmonaut.    However,   upon
checking,   there  was  no  Gorsky  in
either  the Russian or American  space
programs.





Over  the years many people questioned
Armstrong  as to what the@3 "Good  luck,
Mr.   Gorsky"@4  statement  meant,   but
Armstrong always just smiled.


On  July  5,   1995,   in  Tampa  Bay,
Florida,   while  answering  questions
following   a   speech,    a  reporter
brought up the 26-year-old question to
Armstrong.

This  time he finally responded.   Mr.
Gorsky  had  died,  so Neil  Armstrong
felt he could answer the question.

In  1938 when he was a kid in a  small
Midwest town,  he was playing baseball
with  a  friend in the backyard.


His  friend  hit   a   fly  ball,which
landed in his neighbor's yard  by  the
bedroom  windows.  His neighbors  were
Mr. and Mrs. Gorsky.

As  he  leaned  down to  pick  up  the
ball,   young   Armstrong  heard  Mrs.
Gorsky shouting at Mr.  Gorsky. @3 "Sex!
You  want sex?!  You'll get  sex  when
the kid next door walks on the moon!"
