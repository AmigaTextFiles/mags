@5
A  bear  walked into a bar in Bearsden and sat down.  He banged on  the  bar
with his paw and demands a beer.

                      The bartender approached and said,@7

             "We don't serve beer to bears in bars in Bearsden."
@5
      The bear, becoming angry, demanded again that he be served a beer.

          The  bartender told him again,  more forcefully this time,
@7
       "We don't  serve beer to belligerent bears in bars in Bearsden."
@5
                       The bear,  very angry now, said,@2

"If  you don't serve me a beer,  I'm going to eat that lady sitting  at  the
end of the bar."




@5
                             The  bartender said,
@7
"Sorry,   we  don't serve beer to belligerent,  bullying bears  in  bars  in
Bearsden."
 @5
The  bear went to the end of the bar,  and as promised,  ate the woman.   He
came back to his seat, and again demanded a beer.

                            The bartender stated,@7

"Sorry,   we  don't serve beer to belligerent,  bullying bears  in  bars  in
Bearsden that are on drugs."
@5
                    The bear replied,@7 "I'm not on drugs."
@5
       The bartender says,@7 "You are now. That was a@3 bar-bitch-you-ate."

                            The Ladder to Success
                            ---------------------
@3
A  man  was  walking along the street when he saw a ladder  going  into  the
clouds.

As  any  of us would do,  he climbed the ladder.  He reached a cloud,   upon
which sat a rather plump and very ugly woman. @4 "Screw me or climb the ladder
to success,"@3 she said.

   No contest, thought the man, so he climbed the ladder to the next cloud.

On  this cloud was a slightly thinner woman,  who was slightly easier on the
eye.@4 "Screw me hard or climb the ladder to success,"@3 she said.
@5
              "Well,"@3 thought the man,@5 "might as well carry on."
@3
On  the  next cloud was an even more attractive lady who,  this  time,   was
quite  attractive.  @4 "Screw me now or climb  the  ladder  to  success,"@3  she
uttered.  As he turned her down and went on up the ladder,  the man  thought
to himself that this was getting better the further he went.




@3
On the next cloud was an absolute beauty.  Slim,  attractive, the lot.@4 "F**k
me here and now or climb the ladder to success,"@3 she flirted.

Unable  to  imagine what could be waiting,  and being a  gambling  man,   he
decided to climb again.

When he reached the next cloud, there was a 400 pound ugly man, arm pit hair
showing, flies buzzing around his head.
@5
                        "Who are you?"@3 the man asked.

An old man was sitting on a bench at the mall.  A young man walked up to the
bench and sat down.  He had spiked hair in all different colors:@4 green,@2 red,
@1orange,@6 blue,@3 yellow. The old man just stared.


The young man said,@4  "What's the matter old timer,  never done anything wild
in your life?"
@3
   The old man replied,@5 "Well, I got drunk once and had sex with a parrot."

               " I was  just wondering if you were my son...."
