Well  I  have been using@2 RHA@5 for a few mouths now,  the service is  not  the
best.   Well for a start they cut you off every three hours,  well you can't
really complain  at that,  not for the price you are paying. @2  RHA @5 has  its
faults,  like you mostly don't get connected first time, the line is engaged,
your  modem just@1 "screams"@5 at you because at the other end there  is  not  a
modem available for you,  they claim to have a 7 to 1 ratio,  whick to me is
average.  The prices vary and so do the services that they offer,   basiclly
the  more you pay the more you get.  Its set up fee is a steep@3 £30@5 with  the
subscription starting for@3 £10@5 per year,  the way I see it even if  you  only
use  it for a year,  you would of spent more than that you your phone  bill.
The  table below gives you an idea what to expect for the level of  service.
I  like the way they put there status on there web page,  just means you can
go and check before you have to phone them.

As  you can see there is not much different between the services,  over  all
the service is about average, The one thing I don't like about it is the web
address  you  are given if you want to set up your own site,  its  something
like@4 http://username.redhotant.com@5,  when it fairly easy to remember but  it
can be a bit of a pain to type.  Overall I rate@2 RHA#8 7/10.@5  There web site is
