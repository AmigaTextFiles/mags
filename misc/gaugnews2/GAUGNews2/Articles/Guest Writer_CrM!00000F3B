Well,  this is exciting!  Ten years after the Amiga has officially died, and
was buried by all computer experts,  my friend Ian @5"Ferret"@3 Fyvie asks me to
write a guest column for a new Amiga User Group!  Goes to show you shouldn't
say  the  Amiga is dead so soon.  Being a die hard Amiga-user myself,   this
gives  me  a  good feeling.  And even when I'm not even near @1 Glasgow@3,   I'm
honoured  to  be  a  member  of the worldwide group  of  people  that  still
recognise a good computer when they see one.

Let me start by wishing you as a group a good start!  You picked a good time
in  Amiga history to start your group.  I hope that you can help each  other
when help is needed,  and have fun in the process!  Let me tell you a little
bit about myself.



As  I  said,  I'm a die-hard Amiga-user myself.  This started when I got  my
first  Amiga  1000 long ago @1(I think it was the first of it's  kind  in  the
Netherlands,  I had to buy it from Germany)@3, and gradually I started to love
the  machine.  I took an upgrade path through the A500 to a very  beefed  up
A1200 now.  After such a long time using this machine,  I eventually got  to
know  more  people  in  the Amiga world,  and when I  started  to  help  out
@5Haage&Partner@3 here in Germany a couple of years ago,  I  got  to  know  even
more  people@1 "in the business"@3.  Some of those people at that time were  the
people who ran@2 "Raising Hell Productions"@3,  and they were very quick to  ask
me  to  write for their online magazine. @2 Raising Hell Productions@3  recently
changed it's name to@2 Dreamscape Productions@3,  and that's I suppose where  my
link to you is.  Right,  the same group of people who produce this disk  mag
you are reading now!  So, even though I am not in Glasgow, I feel like I'm a
part of your group, if you don't mind.

The  computer we all use might not have changed much in the past  10  years,
but it still does its job for me.  Of course,  keeping an eye on the future,
I'm anxious to learn more about the future plans of Amiga.  But even if this
would still take some time,  I can still use my Amiga for most tasks I throw
at it, and the operating system still is one of the best I've ever used.



It's user groups all around the world,  just like yours,  who kept the Amiga
alive this long,  and it will be user groups just like yours that will  help
the@6 "new Amiga"@3 to take off.  By being a member of an Amiga User Group,   we
are members of a group of people who think differently than the masses,  who
often  go out of their way to help others,  and who are not falling for  the
marketing  tricks  of some of richer companies@1 (I won't  name  any  of  them
here,  to avoid legal problems with@4 MicroSoft@1)@3.  I still believe,  after all
those years,  that by thinking different,  we can make a difference  in  the
computer world.  All the best with your user group,  I'll be in touch in the
future, and don't hesitate to contact me if I could help you with anything!
