                        How I put my A1200 in a tower*2@1
                        =============================
@5
A  lot  of  people want to put their A1200 in a tower case so they  can  add
such things as cd-roms,  HD`s etc. I was one of these people, but looking at
the  prices of the various tower options,  I came up with the idea of  doing
it myself.@1 


                                ***#2WARNING@1***

@5
If  you  are  at  all worried about attempting this yourself  then  I  would
advise  you  to purchase the pre-made options from either Eyetech  or  Power
computing as all of the hard work has been done already.  Also if  you  want
to  add a zorro board expansion then this may not be the option for  you  as
it  is  much easier going down the road of the Power/Eyetech cases  as  they
are designed to take these options.

                         Right, lets get on with it!@7

A  friend had a full size ATX tower he had picked up from work and he let me
have it for £10, that was the easy part!@1 (pic 1)@4

                            ---------------------@5

Finding  where to put the motherboard can be a bit difficult,   I  chose  to
leave  the  bottom of the casing attached to the motherboard and marked  the
back  of the PC case and cut the shape of the motherboard@1 (and bottom case)@5
so  that the ports all showed@1 (see pics 2 & 3)@5.  I had to also move the  PSU
to  the  left side as it was getting in the way of the mobo.  I cut off  the
slots and removed the top part of the back panel which had the cut-outs  for
serial/parralel etc,  as they had now become loose and gave access  for  the
PSU,  this also allowed for@3 EXCELLENT@5 ventilation. I then attached the A1200
to the case using cable ties.  I also used an "L" shaped bracket screwed  to
the bottom of the case and attached to the A1200 case for extra strength.  I
kept the ATX cutouts and attached my keyboard adapter here.@4

Now  a @3 VERY@5 tricky part,  getting power to the A1200,  I read some text  on
getting  an  AT  PSU  wired  to  an A1200 from  the  net  and  followed  the
instructions,  sadly this didn`t work as with an ATX PSU you  have  a  power
checking circuit that you have to ground in order to get power out of it,  I
did  this  by  putting a piece of wire into the power block  socket  on  the
appropriate pins and glued them in place.  I then took the power lines  from
it  and  pushed the wire into the back of the A1200 power socket  and  glued
these  in place too.  If this is too risky for you,  you can use your  A1200
PSU to power the miggy,  but you still need to do the power check fix to get
power for the CD, HD etc.@4

                           Positioning the Floppy.@1
                           ----------------------
@5
My floppy drive is positioned in the very top of the tower,  I used a floppy
cable  from  a  PC  and  took  the twist out of the  cable  by  opening  the
connector  and popping out the twisted part of the cable untwisting  it  and
popping the connector back together.  I then took a floppy cover from a duff
PC  drive  and opened out the eject hole so the button would fit  and  glued
this in the casing.@1 (pic 4)@4

                         What about the drive lights?@1
                         ---------------------------
@5
You  have two options here,  you can take the LED from the top of the  A1200
case and extend the wiring,  take a cd drive slot cover from the PC case and
cut a hole in it so the lights show,  but I didn`t fancy that, so what I did
was  marked  out the AMIGA and drive lights in the shape of  the  drive  bay
cover  and  cut it from the top case and positioned this in  an  empty  bay!
Much nicer!@1 (pic 4)@4

                                 Reset switch@1
                                 ------------
@5
Using  the  reset  switch  from the PC,  I cut the  connector  from  it  and
soldered  one end of the two wires to a ground point and the  other  to  the
reset signal point@1 (see pic 5)@5 easy!!@4

                   Now you can add all your CD`s, HD`s!!!!
