     Yes, the following people have climbed to the highest rung of Amiga
 life: To write for Amiga Link!

     Joshua Galun is the Editor-in-Chief of Amiga Link, and he wrote the
 page with all the information on the bankruptcy's end (the Reader's Digest
 version!), the Editorial, and Imaginary Amiga ad #3.  Send comments,
 letters to the mag, information, dirty gifs, or anything else related to
 the mag, to <Zool@cyberwar.com>

     Roy Millican is the Technical Editor of Amiga Link.  He handles
 everything that Joshua is afraid to touch, and he's a pretty handy writer
 too!  E-mail him at <roy@cts.com>

     Joe Solinsky isn't in advertising, he doesn't even have a TV to watch
 his ad when it hits the airwaves, but he wrote the Imaginary Amiga ad #1
 for all those people who won't believe that the Amiga is good unless they
 see an ad for it during Star Trek!  He can be reached at
 <jcsky@cs.UCR.edu>
 
     Glenn Saunders (krishna@primenet.com) also believes that the Amiga can
 make a comeback, but only if there are ads for it on TV.  And with talent
 like this, as shown by his Imaginary Amiga Ad #3, we're sure that some
 advertising company will snap him up in a second!
 
     Brian Strayer is the C= 64 user who won our hearts with his ongoing
 story, Some Bits of Treasure.  E-mail him at <bstrayer@efn.org>
 
         Bil Irving of Visions Perceived Software shared his views on what
 Escom and Dr. Peter Kittel must do to make the Amiga a major computer
 system again.  You can rebutt him or send him your consent in e-mail, at

@prev "Products"
     You probably have noticed that we have dropped the BBS list at Amiga
 Link.  This is because after my hard drive crashed, I found it too much of
 a hassle to run the BBS list.  Considering how popular the Internet is
 becoming, I believe that in a little while, most people will be on the
 Internet and have access to the WWW and Aminet.
 
     If you wish to receive Amiga Link in e-mail each month, mail the
 address <amigalink-request@ramiga.cts.com> with the message 
 
 ADD <your e-mail address>
 
     Then, every time the magazine comes out, it will be mailed to you
 UUENcoded.  The magazine is quite big, so if your e-mail address cannot
 accept messages of atleast 100k, don't put your name on the list.  
     If you want to be taken off the lits, do the same thing, but
 subsititute DELETE for ADD.
 
     If you have the use of AMosaic or Lynx on your BBS, you can view Amiga
 Link online on 8 different WWW pages.  Their addresses are:
 
 
 <http://ramiga.cts.com>  Roy Millican's home page, one of the best around!
 
 <http://weber.u.washington.edu/~foregone/amigalink/main.html>
 
 <http://www.iglou.com/members/dloeser.html>
 
 <http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/~mjw/amiga/News/Alink>  The Amiga home page!
 Check this page out!

     Ofcourse, you can also get Amiga Link off of the docs/mags directory
 of Aminet, or off many local BBSs.

    In using our Amigas and making Amiga Link, we have come across 
 some products and services that we believe exemplary.  These products have
 all received the much desired Amiga Link @{"Chicken Seal of Quality" system "p-view csq"}.
 They are as follows:    
  
 @{b}@{u}Heddley@{ub}@{uu}:  This is a program to make Amiga Guide documents (such as the one
 you are reading write now), and it is incredible!  Not only is it very 
 easy to use, but it also cuts the time needed to make an Amiga Guide doc
 by a factor of 8, and has many great features!  It's so good that
 we use Heddley here at Amiga Link!  You can find Heddley v1.1 on Aminet.
 The author is Edd Dumbill.
 
 @{b}@{u}Page Stream 3.0g@{ub}@{uu}:  Version 3 of this product was released early because of
 pressure, and as a result is was very buggy.  However, Soft Logik has been
 very good about trying to fix the bugs and about spreading the new
 releases around.  Page Stream 3.0g is not perfect, but it's pretty damn
 close!  This product really brings the Amiga DTP up to industry standards,
 and we reccomend it to anyone interested in doing DTP on the Amiga, or any
 computer!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------







 This is a log of the Conference on effnet on 4/21/95 starting at 8:00pm
 PST.  All editing done by Roy Milican(AK) Technical Editor of Amiga Link.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------








   jcompton> Welcome to the First and (I hope) Last Commodore Auction
            Conference, sponsored by Amiga Report and Amiga Link
            Magazines-"It's news, and it's cheap.  What more do you want?"

   jcompton> The ground rules:

   jcompton> We'll be explaining, in as much detail as is possible, what
            happened over the past two days of the Commodore auction
            proceedings.

   jcompton> Then our esteemed op-panel of developers will be free to offer
            any questions or comments they see fit (careful, boys).

   jcompton> After that, we'll go to the floor for questions.  This is a
            very complicated affair...if you weren't aware Commodore was in
            liquidation, you'll probably not catch up tonight.

   jcompton> The Auction issue of Amiga Report Magazine should be making
            its rounds now.../msg your neighbor for a DCC if you don't have
            it yet.  (note-don't /msg me...)

   jcompton> With that said...if there are no objections from the ops, I'll
             delve into a mini-summary of what's happened...

   jcompton> No?  Ok, here goes.

   jcompton> The Short Version: Escom AG, the #2 German PC clone
            manufacturer, has successfully entered a bid for Commodore's
            assets, including (but certainly not limited to) the Amiga
            technology.

   jcompton> The slightly more explained version:  Yesterday (Thursday) was
            the auction for Commodore.  What we had been lead to expect was
            a heated bidding battle between CEI's Alex Amor and C= UK's
            David Pleasance...after all, they'd been the most vocal in
            their

   jcompton> pursuit for the Amiga.

   jcompton> As it turns out, neither of them bid.  Instead, the only three
            bids came from Escom, Dell (a large US PC clone maker) and a
            California dealer.

   jcompton> The Dell and dealer bids were thrown out.  Escom's $5 million
            contract, signed in March, was accepted by the liquidator.

   jcompton> Almost immediately after the auction, the C= UK heads issued a
            press release withdrawing from the running.

   jcompton> The next day (Friday), at the court hearing, the objections to
            the process were heard.

   jcompton> From what I've gathered from the attendees (Josh Galun and
            Giorgio Gomelsky), the three pre-filed objections from C= US'
            creditors, IBM, and the C= Netherlands/Philippines/UK trustees
            were done with without a ton of effort.

   jcompton> However, it seems that the C= Netherlands people were
            temporarily successful in removing the Philippines inventory of
            parts and Commodore UK from the buyout package.

   jcompton> The other objection came from Dell, who, in conjunction with
            Alex Amor, entered a new $15 million bid.

   jcompton> This did not please Escom.  A recess was called.  At the end
            of the recess, Escom had doubled their bid, that bid was
            accepted, and so ends the process.

   jcompton> The Bahamas Supreme Court still has to approve the deal next
            week, but by their own agreement, it should be nothing more
            than a rubber-stamp process.

   jcompton> In addition, Escom could always fail to close the deal, in
            which case the second-highest bidder, Dell, would be offered
            the package.  Dell has asked for a 30 day "trial" period on the
            Amiga, which was part of the unacceptable (to the liquidators)
            condition of their bid.

   jcompton> However, as of now, Escom is the heir to the Commodore suite.
            What they choose to do with this is at present unclear.

   jcompton> They have promised everything from more Amigas to Commodore
            64s for China and "Commodore" Macintosh clones.

   jcompton> That about covers what I've got on my mind now.  Josh?
            Anything to add?

       Zool> Yes, I do Jason.  Thanks a lot for a nice summary

       Zool> OK.  Just to expand on what Jason said about the bidding...

       Zool> Yesterday, Dell/CEI entered a bid, however it was rejected in
            favor of Escom's bid.  After this, Dell kept working with on
            their deal

       Zool> Dell submitted the bid, which was higher, but also required a
            30 day waiting period.  Anyway, as you now know, Escom raised
            their bid by 6.5 million dollars, and that cleared up all the
            obhections

       Zool> Anyway, I did an interview with the man who will be heading
            the Amiga devision at Escom, and this is what he had to say

       Zool> (I can't remember his name)  He said that Escom wants to
            improve on the Amiga technology.  Tight now, they are
            interested in making a Power PC Amiga, although that is not a
            decision written in stone

       Zool> He said that they have an agreement with a Chinese
            manufacturer, who will be shipping new Amigas in 2 months

       Zool> They said that they also want to use the Amiga technology for
            other products, such as set top boxes for TV

       Zool> When I asked them about liscencing Amiga clones, they said
            that anything was a possibility at this point, and that we may
            see Amiga clones

       Zool> Escom sounded very open on their policy on the Amiga, as much
            of what I questioned them on was replied to with "yes, that may
            be possible.  We'll look into it"

       Zool> Later in the day I talked to Colin Proudfoot of C= UK.

       Zool> Colin Proudfoot said that in Escom is meeting with C= UK in
            two weeks, and that Escom will most likely buy C= UK at that
            point 
            
       Zool> Colin said that Escom may have wanted the Amiga to use it to
            go into the US Computer market

       Zool> He said that Escom doesn't want to start up an American
            operation with only PCs, since you can already get PCs very
            cheaply in the US.  On the other hand, if they came into the
            computer market with new technoilogy, that would seperate them
            from the crowd 

       Zool> Escom, by the way, said that they would try to hire as many
            ex-C= techs as possible, and that they already have some on
            their staff.  They did say, however, that some ex-C= techs
            already had new jobs that they were haooy with

       Zool> Anyway, in the end, my interview with Escom left me pretty
            satisfied with their plans.

       Zool> Although I think that CEI/DELL would have been better for the
            Amiga, Escom could still be very good, especially with the
            business savvy and 2 billion dollars in sales they had last
            year

       Zool> Alex Amor, when he lost the bid, sat stoically, and left soon
            after the announcement.  He made no comment on what had
            happened

       Zool> Jason, I give the floor back to you.

  Devophile> Zool: I am sure I speak for everyone when I thank you for this
            information.

       Zool> Devophile:  it was my pleasure.

   jcompton> For those of you who worry about transcripts, a raw version
            will be available soon after the conference.  After that, if
            you want an edited version, wait for the appearance on Aminet
            or for AR 3.09 or Amiga Link #3.

       Zool> I would also like to say that the text version of my
            interviews with Escom and C= UK should be on Aminet soon.
            
   jcompton> I've had time to read over Josh and Giorgio's interview with
            Escom.  Obviously, he was with the guy, so I'm one level
            removed.

   jcompton> Still, I am not exactly convinced that Escom's interests lie
            with the Amiga.  From a strictly financial point of view, Escom
            is poised to launch their PCs in the UK (now that they have
            obtained the Commodore name AND the large chain of Rumbelowes
            stores)

       Zool> About the Phillipine plant, although Escom does not have it
            yet, apparently they should have it very soon.

   jcompton> ...they have spoken of Mac clones, and of course C-64s in
            China.  With markets like that, it seems that the Amiga could
            easily fall by the wayside...thinking that the Amiga is an
            inroad to the US is ludicrous-Escom hasn't checked the Amiga's
            public image in the US lately.

    KermitW> I don't think that's the point.

  Devophile> jcompton: The plans for the US market seem to be right on the
            nose, as far as the US is concerned. New technology can be
            welcomed or outcast, depending on how it is brought forward.

       Zool> Escom believes that the Amiga can make money, which is why
            they're in this, and not because they have any fondness for the
            amiga.  However, they will pour money into Amiga R&D, and they
            think that the Amiga can make money for them

  Devophile> jcompton: Let us hope Escom knows what they are doing.

         AK> Does Escom have the capital and willing to use it to launch a
            marketing plan in the US.

       Zool> AK: they have the capital

   jcompton> So, of course, the logical course of action is to make sure
            they DON'T forget.  They have repeatedly avoided contact with
            the Amiga community and lied to journalists.  I'm not accusing
            them of doing it in this case, but my point is that there are
            no assurances.  I currently have no contact information for
            Escom...Josh?

   Fastlane> jcompton: what ever happened to the 'rumor' that Escom had a
            side-deal with CEI with regards to the technology and the
            trademarks?

       Zool> AK:  I believe that they will market it in the US, because
            according to C= UK, they want to make inroads into the US
            market

   jcompton> Fastlane: Considering that Escom told Alex that their
            relationship depended on his performance at the auction, and
            that he tossed in his hat with Dell...well, CEI isn't ruling
            anything out, but I'm not holding my breath.

  Devophile> Fastlane: The smart thing for Escom to do would be a joint
            deal with CEI, as CEI knows the US market and has the
            distribution channels. Plus, a strong goal to get the Amiga
            back on top.

       Zool> Fastlane:  It is conceivable that Escom might liscence Amiga
            clones to CEI

   jcompton> Kermit: You were going to say something?

   Fastlane> Devophile: agreed.  Escom only seems to want it all for the
            name anyway.

    fallous> Why don't we hear from the developers before we turn this
            loose to the rest of us?

  Devophile> fallous: Agreed.

   jcompton> fallous: That was what I was trying to get to. :)

         AK> When will Escom make a official press release?

       Zool> Fastlane:  As I said, Escom seems excited about the Amiga. The
            man from Escom said "We wouldn't have spent all this time and
            12 million dollars if we didn't want the Amiga"

    KermitW> Only that the Amiga lends a uniqueness to a company looking to
            startup in the

       Zool> AK:  Probably tommorow, to AP

    KermitW> US market that they would lack with yet-another-pc-clone.  It
            might not be the

   jcompton> AK: "When they're damn good and ready", I would expect.

    KermitW> top of their market or even a large part of it, but it could
           be the thing that

    KermitW> could keep them in the press and, face it, the Amiga's still
            pretty good at

       Zool> And Escom wouldn't pour money into R&D for the Amiga if they
            didn't want to continute with the Amiga brand

    KermitW> getting used in TV and film venues for publicity.  CBM never
            truly made use of this, but a smart company could.

   jcompton> Zool: Until we see some serious commitment from Escom, and
            some serious former employees-not C= Germany exec and sales
            staff, Commodore engineering.

   jcompton> Zool: Until then, there's no guarantee of anything.

       Zool> KermitW:  Escom has business smarts.

  PillBottl> Zool: But they need engineering smarts too.

  Devophile> All: Escom needs to face the reality that the Amiga is still a
            viable platform. And with proper R&D, marketting, and
            distribution - the Amiga can make Escom a lot of money. But
            they need to support the users, the developers, and listen to
            comments

  Devophile> and suggestions.

       Zool> jcompton:  True, but Escom did sound excited about the Amiga.
            I genuinely think that Escom wants to market and sell Amigas.

    fallous> Kevin, do you have a view from SoftLogik?

         AK> Will Escom pursue 3rd party support that has sence left the
            Amiga?

    KermitW> Until I see otherwise, I would assume Escom is business smart.

       Zool> PillBottl:  that's why they are hiring ex-C= techs.

   jcompton> Zool: Then why avoid contact with the Amiga market since
            August of 1994?

   Beowulf_> I assume it's also not out of the question for Escom to
            license the Amiga technology to third parties...

       Zool> jcompton:  I don't know.  Perhaps because C= was a hideous
            company, and they didn't want to deal with them?  Also, they
            said that they had sold Amigas at Escom stores before

    KermitW> Remember that some of that third party support that left the
            Amiga, left

  softlogik> Soft-Logik is comitted to the Amiga as long as long as the
            market can support them. No special info on Escom yet.

    KermitW> because they WEREN'T successful on the Amiga, and many still
            weren't

    KermitW> relatively successful after leaving anyway.

       Zool> KermitW:  Yes, but Escom is going to buy C= UK, and C= UK had
            GREAT developer relationship.  They put on a World of Amiga
            show after C= died.

  PillBottl> A big pat on the back to Softlogik and the other "important"
            developers who kept the faith!

      bytey> The real question is will a real effort be made to get a new
            Amiga model out (new chipset) and that would require a _lot_ of
            work software wise.  Do they have previous software staff ?
            (Chris Hames PC-Task/DirWork etc)

  Devophile> A comment I just received was in regards to why developers are
            "tripping over each other to leave this platform", simply
            because C= did not support developers, nor users as well as
            should have, and have been basically gone for a year. :)

       Zool> bytey:  They did say that they had and were hiring ex-C=
            people.
             
       Zool> bytey:  Some C= techs don't want to come back, though.

    KermitW> As a developer (of ImageFX) I can say that it wasn't like
            anyone is forcing

  Devophile> Softlogik: Thank you for not betraying us, we are all
            appreciative.

      bytey> Zool: But ex CBM does not mean ex US software developers.  The
            ones with the knowledge that would take months to learn.

    KermitW> developers to leave the Amiga.  The market, your sales, are
            what push you into

       Zool> SoftLogik:  I'm with Devophile.  Nice job, you guys!

        Nyx> Well, forget my log guys. :P

    KermitW> new platforms.  A lot of companies who visibly and audibly
            left the Amiga to

         AK> Devophile: Be tray is alittle strong, they just have to think
            of the business aspect.

      Cappy> As the president of one of the most successful C= user groups
            in the country, I hope that a US branch gets implimented soon
            and get user groups involved as much as possible.

  Devophile> Cappy: Yes.

    KermitW> go to Macs, SGIs and PCs weren't run well or making the money
            they needed.  In

  softlogik> The boss thanks you.

    lemming> There is a log being kept by t00 still

    KermitW> many cases it's because their Amiga products weren't "up to
            snuff" anymore.

       Zool> bytey:  Well, I assume the reason they are hiring ex-C= people
            is to get people with smarts on the Amiga OS.  Also, many ex-C=
            people don't want to come back because they have already found
            nice jobs.

  Devophile> AK: Yes. It was a poor choice of words. :) "abandon" would
            have been better.

    fallous> Such as GVP

       Zool> Cappy:  Escom said that they would be starting a US operation
            pretty soon.  I'll have the info on that within 2 weeks.

      bytey> have they said anything about _real_ developer support ?

     Light2> All:  Bernard van Tienen ESCOM was vice-president of Commodore
            International.  Does he have a track record we can follow?

       Zool> bytey:  Nothing other than:  "Yes, we'll work with developers"

       Zool> Light2:  BTW, that was who I spoke with at Escom

   jcompton> bytey: Again, there have been no solid commitments, just a lot
            of broad based indications of what CAN happen.

   Fastlane> Zool: that has been said by many before... but did it ever
            REALLY eventuate?

  Devophile> I just received an amusing comment.. "Did Sony buy Amiga or
            what?"

      Cappy> Zool: Does Escom have an email address that they can be
            reached?  I'd like to press the issue of the importance of user
            groups.

       Zool> FastLane:  Who has said that before?  Other than C=?

       Zool> Cappy:  I don't believe so.

       Zool> Devophile:  :)

   Fastlane> Zool: my point exactly.

     Light2> Zool:  Yes, I read the transcripts.  I would really like to
            know what to expect.  Previous track records in mind.

   jcompton> Cappy: E-mail?  Not to our knowledge.  That would make too
            much sense.  They're not even sure if they want to use the net
            to help promote their product.

    KermitW> We're quite willing to give Escom the time they need to do
            this.  It can't

      Idcmp> Many ex-C='s like Dave Haynie and Dale Larson have already
            said that they don't like the direction that Escom is planning
            for the Amiga and

       Zool> Fastlane: Yes, that is a problem.  But since we have no real
            choice in this, we have to jhope for the best.

    KermitW> possibly happen overnight or even over just two months.
            Developer support,

      Idcmp> it would take more $$ rather than less or equal $$ to get them
            to go back to R&D rather than if CEI or alike had got it.

    KermitW> user group programs, new machines, all this will take time for
            anyone.

       Zool> You know, if Amiga users had banded together, we could have
            had a legal right to send a representative to the court hearing
            to plead for who we wanted?

       Zool> Idcmp:  Yes, but Escom has a lot of money.

      Cappy> jcompton or Zool: How about a snail mail address?

   jcompton> Um, guys, I hate to interject, but we're losing the flow
            here...

  Devophile> Another comment, Dell has a better "image" in the US than
            Escom.  People might be more apt to but Amigas with the Dell
            name versus Amigas with the Escom name.

   Beowulf_> jcompton:  Is there a snail mail address?

      Idcmp> Zool: And in that sense Escom is alot like Commodore. (was)

       Zool> Devophile:  I dobut that will make much a difference once
            Escom has an operation here.

    fallous> OK, jcompton wants to gain some control, so I'm deopping a few
            of us

   jcompton> Beo: None that I have access to.  Zool may have one, if not,
            I'll try to get it from Dan Stets.

  Devophile> Let us all give Jason control again. 

   jcompton> Everyone, please calm down.  I'd like to actually let the
            general public be heard, so...

    fallous> Sorry, der Fuhr made me do it. ;)

       Zool> fallous:  For the good of the whole, write? :)

    Bandini> Is NewTek still supporting the Amiga or are they concentrating
            their efforts on IBM Toasters?

   jcompton> Ok, am I back in charge?

   jcompton> Bandini: SHHHHHHHHH.

    fallous> OK, let's have jcompton run this show.

   jcompton> Ok.  I guess I do.  I'm going to start taking requests for
            comments/questions.  /msg me with a ?.  You have to be on
            #auction for this to work...

       Harv> So what's up with Alex/CEI?......

       Harv> I can't believe he's just gonig to fade away.....

       Harv> is an Escom/CEI deal possible? or even desireable? GA

       Zool> Harv:  He could possibly get a liscence to clone Amigas.

   jcompton> Harv: Well, Giorgio told me Alex said "I'm going to grow
            flowers."  I haven't talked to him today.  He didn't give up
            over a year's time, so...

   jcompton> Harv: At the same time, throwing in with Dell certainly didn't
            help him in Escom's eyes.  On the other hand, money's still
            money.

     PieMan> Thankyou. Does escom have any plans to continue to manifacture
            amiga cd32 console type machines? ga

   jcompton> Fallous is handling voice, he's a bit behind, so just hold
            on...

       Zool> Pieman:  I think so

   jcompton> Pieman: I haven't heard anything that specific discussed.  I
            don't see why not, I know of at least two companies who would
            love new units for their own products...

       Zool> Pieman: It makes sense.  Escom wants to get Amiga tech in
            other things than the Amiga computers, so the CD32 would be
            step towards a set top box

   jcompton> Pieman: But again, this is one of those things Escom needs to
            be made aware of.

       Zool> Pieman:  Also, if the Phillipine plant does have 130,000 akiko
            chips in stock, and they buy it, I'm sure Escom will want to
            make CD32s.

       Zool> Pieman:  there is still good profit to be had in CD32s and
            royalties off it.

       Zool> Pieman: It fits with Escom's strategy.

       Zool> GA

   jcompton> Beowulf_'s up.

   Beowulf_> Mention was made of Escom producing the 64 for sale in some
            parts of the world.  Do you know of any plans for 64's to be
            sold in the US (specifically the SX 64)?

   Beowulf_> GA

   jcompton> Beowulf: Again, that's gotta be up to them.  The Chinese
            market seems to be where they want to put the 64-it's cheap to
            make and cheap to buy.  There's always the CMD market in the
            US, but again, Escom may not be aware of that.

       Zool> GA...I have nothing to say.

   jcompton> Beowulf: I, personally, would be surprised.

   jcompton> GA.

   jcompton> So, that brings up jjohnson.

   jjohnson> If C= Uk is a subsidiary (sp?) of C= Intl who was just bought
            by Escom (and the Phillipines plant also), how can those two
            entities not be included with the deal? Thanks. GA

       Zool> jjohnson:  no, C= UK is not part of Escom, but Escom plans to
            buy it in 2 weeks  time.

       Zool> Escom also will probably buy the Phillipines plant.

   jcompton> Good question.  C= UK is DIRECTLY owned by Commodore BV, which
            is in liquidation.  Its trustees objected to the sale of its
            assets through C= International (the Philippines assets and C=
            UK).

   jcompton> C= BV SHOULD have to report to C= International, but because
            of Commodore's convoluted structure...

   jcompton> Zool: The inventory, not the plant.  They don't own the plant.

       Zool> jcompton:  It may be illegal to sell the plant to anyone other
            than Escom, because there may be Amiga tech still in there that
            Escom owns.  That is what the court said.

       oleg> stoopid  question, is the court-approved contract available
            electronically? it is a public document, so it can be
            requested. has anyone done that?

            want to type it in.  I'll ask the lawyers on Monday, though.

       Zool> jcompton:  Ofcourse, there are such things as scanners... :)

   jcompton> oleg: You might be able to get it sent to you from the office.

   jcompton> Zool: Which any member of the audience can feel free to buy
            for me.

       oleg> jcompton actually it *should* be available for the cost of
            copying/mailing from the bankruptcy court if it is not
            available from the attorneys

       Zool> jcompton:  :)

       Zool> jcompton:  Maybe a company that makes scanners will be good
            enough to take an ad out in AR, right? 

   jcompton> irc's not here, so shadowhwk's up.

  Shadowhwk> Has any evidence as to whether or not ESCOM has talked to, met
            with or is planning to meet with NewTek?  GA

   jcompton> Zool: I can always hope.

    HammerD> Any mention of C= Canada or other operating subsidaries? Was
            Douglas MacGregor there? (head of C= Canada)

   jcompton> Ok, then, how about bytey?

      bytey> What is Escom's reputation in Germany ? GA

   jcompton> HD: Not clear.

         AK> A Amiga Deal friend of mine has said that NewTek has
            officially stated that the future Amiga is of no concern of
            theirs.

       Zool> Are there any Germans here who have dealt with Escom?  If so,
            /msg Zool so that I can answer bytey

   jcompton> bytey: Like any large company, Escom has its supporters and
            detractors.  On .misc, there's a thread, one person lauds Escom
            for great potential, the other says their service sucks.

    fallous> People are waiting in line for their questions, let's stay
            with the queue

   jcompton> bytey: But they've demonstrated tremendous growth lately, so
            they've got attention on them, and this can't hurt.  So I guess
            the quick answer is: you'll know soon.

   jcompton> Ok, Shadowhwk was lagged, let's try again...

       Zool> bytey:  Willow says that Escom is very big, but doesn't have
            good service.

  Shadowhwk> Has any evidence as to whether or not ESCOM has talked to, met
            with or is planning to meet with NewTek?  GA

       Cryo> there's more to life than NewTek

   jcompton> Shadow: Too specific.  If they have, they haven't made it
            public.

   jcompton> Everyone has to understand...Escom has been incredibly
            secretive over the past months.  We found out more about their
            plans and thought processes today than we did since the rumors
            started spreading in September.

   jcompton> So, any secret deals, meetings, or promises they may have made
            are still total unknowns.

   jcompton> GA

        Nyx> I'd like to mention along with Cryo that NewTek, while being a
            very "public" company in the eyes of the public, never sold
            enough Amigas to keep C= alive.  Commodore survived on the
            low-end machines, and always did.

   jcompton> That'll bring up CHamer.

       oleg> There is a thread on c.g.lightwave (initiated by lee stranahan
            an ex-NewTek employee) that NEwTek is in deep financial
            trouble... Thus they may at least be interested in selling
            Amiga Toasters for a while, if only to liquidate their
            inventory.

        Nyx> The only reason C= had high-end machines at all was for a
            technology proving ground.

       Zool> By the way, people, Willow has told me that service is on of
            Escom's selling points, but that in practice, like Radio Shack,
            it's not very good, because the people don't have the
            expertise.

     CHamer> Thanks. Are there any 'surprise' legal actions on the part of
            the 'un-successful' bidders set to slow this down again? GA

       Zool> CHamer:  No, it seems as if all is smooth saling from here on
            in.

    fallous> Would another op please take over the voicing?  I seem to be
            getting lagged.

   jcompton> CH: Good question.  The only chance would be at the Bahamas
            court, but the court has all but signed in blood that they'll

   Cyclone2> How much is Escom planning to put into Amiga R&D?  This is a
            legitimate concern, since C= invested about $30 million a year

            Amiga would, and the 64 certainly won't be an engineering
            challenge.

   jcompton> GA.

       Zool> jcompton:  Yes, but if they believe that the Amiga can be a
            viable computer, they will spend on R&D.

   jcompton> Zool: Of course.

       Zool> jcompton:  And Escom did say that they bought it to make
            Amigas, and that they wouldn't have put the time into it
            otherwise, nor the money.

       Zool> Another Escom phone number, this one Germany:  +49 6252 71313 
            Thank ChrisDi for that one!

   jcompton> Zool: I think they could turn a handy profit without the
            Amiga.  In fact, I'll submit that the Amiga is the riskiest
            part of a balanced diet of PC and Mac clones, the 64, and the
            Amiga.

       Zool> jcompton:  They could make a profit without the Amiga, but
            they could make a bigger profit WITh the Amiga.  

       Cryo> if you aren't paying attention, you will lose your slot

       Zool> jcompton:  I believe that they want to revamp the Amiga.  I
            could be very wrong, but that is what they conveued to me.  And
            a revitalized Amiga sold in big computer chains could make
            money.  

   jcompton> Cryo: Some people are lagged, though...we ARE putting a lot of
            load on...

        Nyx> Not unless you can attract big name software vendors as well.

       Zool> Nyx:  Those will come if Escom sells Amigas again, especially
            if they put them in all Escom stores and other big computer
            chains.

   jcompton> Nyx: But, Ken, with you at EA, that shouldn't a problem. :)

        Nyx> Zool: Perhaps in Europe.

       Cryo> chamer: speak or die

     CHamer> When are we going to see some machines appear?

       Zool> I think that Escom should sell cheap A1200s to China, because
            that would really boost the Amiga user market.

       Zool> CHamer:  In 2 months, according to Escom.

       Zool> CHamer:  They already had a deal set up with a Chinese firm to
            make Amigas in their plants.

     CHamer> Is that real, or just 'smoke'?

       mr_t> Have Escom talket with the AmigaOS replacement group? and what
            are their plans for distribution to others than their own
            stores?

   jcompton> Zool: Um, your interview says 3 months.

       Zool> Chamer:  Well, the Chinese were at the hearing, so i assume
            so.

       Zool> jcompton:  [sigh]  That must have been a typo...

       mr_t> How are they going to promote the Amiga vs PC?

   jcompton> mr_t: Another question locked in the brains of many German and
            Dutch execs.  We just don't know yet.

       Zool> mr_t:  Willow informs me that Escom hasn't contacted the Amiga
            OS project.  However, C= Uk did contact the Amiga OS project,
            and Escom will be buying C= UK, so they may contact them
            through C= UK.  GA

      Optic> Will American/Canadian stores be able to sell Amigas, or do
            Escom only sell their products through Escom retail outlets?

   jcompton> GA

       Zool> Optic:  I assume that Escom will sell Amigas everywhere.  It
            makes business sense to sell them in stores other than their
            own, because they can make more profit off the Amiga that way.


       Pala> what did do the amiga director of escom when he was at C=, how
            good how bad ? GA

   jcompton> Zool: That's a pretty simplified view.  Pleasance sent the OS
            people a letter saying "Good work, carry on, we think it's
            neat", but there was no commitment made...

       Zool> Optic:  Ofcourse, that will be a measure of how much they want
            the Amiga to survive.  If they don't allow other stores to have
            it, that's a bad sign.

       Zool> jcompton:  Actually, he said that they were interested in
            talking to them, and that was before they got the Amiga, and
            just that he acknowledges them is a good sign.

   jcompton> Pala: Good question.  I'd never heard of the guy.  

       Zool> jcompton:  I though you knew everything about C=...my
            idolization of you is shattered... :)

   jcompton> Zool: Sorry, CIL management wasn't one of my fortes.

   jcompton> I'd just like to interject that I DO strongly feel that
            Escom's purchase of Commodore's assets seriously imperils the
            future of floor scrubber development.

       mage> From which point would it be realistic to think Escom would
            continue R&D?  Will they start over from scratch, or will they
            keep any of the "old stuff" ?

   jcompton> (It's been asked that I point out that CIL had a good dozen or
            two vice presidents at any given time, so this one was probably
            nothing to wrry about.)

       Zool> I just want to say that although I agree that Escom could turn
            out to be VERY bad, they could also turn out to be VERY good
            for the Amiga.

   jcompton> mage: Well, Amor toyed with the idea of scrapping AAA and
            3DRISC, because the benefit-to-time ratio may not have added
            up.  But it's going to be up to Escom's evaluation.

       Zool> mage:  I don't think we really know.  They could go Power PC
            and, make old software compatible, or they might feel that it
            is easier to start from scratch with the Power PC.

       Cryo> those who aren't getting voice propagated on their turn, send
            me a msg and I'll add you back in the list

       Cryo> the network is obviously fucked as usual.

   jcompton> mage: As it stands, AAA and 3DRISC (separately) are each a
            good 18+ months from saleable completion.

   jcompton> msg rlsayer Reminded me, that is.

       Zool> jcompton:  "saleable"?  :)

        Nyx> Zool: 18+ months before you could have them in a sellable
            product.

       Cryo> droids: you're on

     droids> Does Escom have a floor scrubber, and do they know how to use
            it?    GA

   jcompton> I like "saleable".

   jcompton> droids: Probably, but unfortuately they haven't admitted it.

       Zool> Also, I think that with Escom, we pretty much have an all or
            nothing venture.  They either are going to kill the Amiga, or
            do great things with it and push it like crazy.

     WilloW> Zool: That's correct. Is a totaly unknown thing. Maybe they
            are worse then C= or ten times better.

       Cryo> technical difficulties

       Cryo> please sit by

      HiDog> Did Escom mention their intended market?  High/low end,
            desktop/console etc.?  I still have a feeling they might just
            milk the Amiga technology as is and eventually kill it i.e.
            cheap settop box...  GA

   jcompton> Any more questions?  We're going to close the queue soon...

   jcompton> Hidog: They mentioned all markets, like the good salesmen they
            had on hand.

       Cryo> tritn, you're on

       Zool> HiDog:  I believe that they want to do low end for new
            markets, like China, but on the other hand, I think they wanted
            to make Amiga business machines for the European market, which
            is very business oriented

      Sudog> How long can we expect to wait (perhaps an estimate?) before
            we see some sort of action in North America? I'm looking for
            general ballpark, not exact figures. So far from what I've
            heard, it doesn't look good for us. Please, your impressions
            would be wlcm.

      Sudog> GA

      Sudog> Wait!

      Sudog> I ask this for the users out ther who have broken Amigas! Like
            broken a4000s.

      Sudog> NOW GA.

   jcompton> sudog: Well, what Giorgio told me about their answer to the US
            distribution question was NOT encouraging.  Their answer was
            "Well, we'll look for the best people", which means "We haven't
            thought about it."

       Zool> Sudog:  Escom said that they want to set up American offices
            soon, and Colin Proudfoot says that Escom wants to use this to
            get into the US market, so I think it looks pretty good.

       Zool> jcompton:  Hmmm...conflicting answers...

       oggy> Escom are breaking into the UK PC market theyve bought up all
            the rumberlow(formaly owned by Thorn Emi) and are opening
            superstores on top of these in the UK, now theyve bought C= and
            say they plan to break into the US market as well, although
            they have..

   jcompton> Zool: Yes, and you were both talking to the same guy...

       Cryo> transcripts will be available on www.warped.com

       oggy> large captial, will it be enough or have they bitten off more
            than they can chew?

       Cryo> uh oh.. guard your sheep.. joec is up

       Zool> jcompton:  perhaps I misunderstood his statement.  However, he
            did say that they were going to be setting up some kind of US
            contact, somehow, and Colin Proudfoot did say that Escom wanted
            to get into the US market.

   jcompton> oggy: Rhetorical question. :)

       Zool> oggy: Escom definitely has the capital to the do whatever they
            want with teh Amiga...

       JoeC> What was Microsoft's objection at the hearing, and who gets to
            pay that old cursor patent fee now from that other company?

   jcompton> Zool: Because as salesmen, they would be committing suicide to
            rule anything out.  That's their job.

   jcompton> JoeC: Microsoft didn't object, they were at the auction as a
            creditor.

       Zool> oggy:  The computer market is growing in Europe, and they are
            positioned to make a nice sum off it.

   jcompton> JoeC: And it will fall on Escom to re-license the CadTrack
            patent, and pay up all of the MANY MANY patents that are "not
            in good standing".

   jcompton> For instance, the CrossDOS license is not in good standing,
            along with hundreds of others.

       Cryo> corinna.. speak

    Corinna> Comment: We need to be positive about the future with Escom,
            being negative will not help anyone, us or them.  This could be
            a whole new era for the Amiga.  KEEP THE FAITH! :)

   jcompton> Interestingly enough, not even Consultron knew it was not in
            good standing...

    Corinna> Thanks to Zool and Jason and all other folks for the info! GA!

       Zool> Corinna:  Thank you!  I think that since we are stuck with
            Escom, we should hope for the best, and wait to see what
            happens.

   jcompton> (The queue is closed)...


      Optic> jc: What about the Amiga speech synth?

   jcompton> I'll agree...but this is also not the time to be complacent. 
            We've been screwed around before, and this last year hasn't
            exactly been fun, so it's worth our while to make DAMN sure
            Escom knows what they have to do.

    Piranha> Since IBM still has patents pending on some of the
            architecture on the Amiga platform, is it *secure* that Escom
            has the technology, or will they end up going to court again?
            This will put our Amiga's out of commission 'again'. Is this
            something we have to worry about?  Go Ahead-GA

   jcompton> Optic: I didn't see it in there, I thought that was a dead
            issue.

       Zool> Piranha: It is secure.

       Zool> Pirahna:  IBM dropped their objection, as far as I understand.


    Drizzit> Will Escom allow ship Amigas with better CPUs with stock
            machines (ie 25,33,&40MHz models) instead of just one (25MHz
            right now)?  And will they move on to the PowerPC, the 060, or
            some other RISC based chip?

   jcompton> Piranha: Unfortunately, the result of IBM's claim was unclear.
            The main problem seems to be that they weren't LISTED as
            holders, making them wonder what the liquidator was trying to
            pull.

   jcompton> Drizzit: We don't know the answer yet.

   jcompton> Piranha: They held a license, not the patents themselves.

       Zool> Drizzit:  The have said that they like the Power PC chip, but
            that no decision has been made yet.

       Cryo> super samarai cybers up

       Cryo> go lighty

     Lighty> The following question is for Zool to include in his next
            interview with Escom:

     Lighty> I realize that the matter has probably not been discussed
            internally yet, but in a future version of the Amiga's OS, do
            they plan to include plan to include internet capabilities?

     Lighty> GE

     Lighty> err...GA

       Zool> Lighty:  OK, I'll ask them that when I next speak to them. 
            Thanks for the suggestion.

       Cryo> tritn: you're on

       Cryo> anyone I miss?

       Cryo> tritn, you type "Hello, I have a question"

   jcompton> If you were missed, let us know now...

       Cryo> no bunghole.. type

       Cryo> type type type type type

      TritN> Hello I have a Question

      TritN> I'm sure I speak on Behalf of many ppl within the large Amiga
            community of Montreal, Quebec. I Must ask, Is there any news
            about distribution in other countries like Canada? (Also please
            comment of fate of C= Canada) GA

       Cryo> there is no hope for some people

       mr_t> Has Escom said anything about what direction the are planning
            on developing hardware and OS (besides setop and PPC)? GA

   jcompton> Tritn: C= Canada was a direct subsidiary of C= International,
            so will be part of Escom.

   jcompton> Tritn:  No news about Canada otherwise, though.

   Fastlane> let me add also with Australia (C=Australia was never any
            good)

       Zool> mr_t:  No.

   jcompton> Ok, it's really closed for real now, no more etc.

   jcompton> mr_t: No, but I'm sure they haven't ruled anything out.

       Cryo> dra: you're up

    Draegon> What kind of support can we posibly expect for older amigas?
            GA...

   jcompton> Draegon: I'd say you should stop hot-swapping joysticks now,
            just in case.

       Cryo> cybers: online

     cybers> can we send a copy of this to Escom?

       Cryo> cybers: yes, with a xerox of my butt

   jcompton> cybers: Yeah, but make it one of the edited ones.

       Cryo> chamer: you're 15 seconds starts now ;-)

     CHamer> Thanks, Are there going to be assurance that while machine
            production ramps up, that parts will become available as well?
            GA

   jcompton> CH: No, there's no assurance of that at all.  This is another
            one of those things Escom won't think of unless they hear
            enough complaints and prodding.

       Cryo> spinner marks the end of the queue

       oleg> zool, who exactly are you, and what relationship, if any do
            you have with ESCOM?

    Spinner> Will the Chinese manufacturer mean cheaper (cost and/or
            quality), more expensive, or similar to current AMigas?

    Spinner> Will we see an A4000 cost competitive to a 486 syustem?  GA.

       Zool> oleg:  I am the Editor-in-Chief of Amiga Link Online Magazine.
            I have no relationship with Escom, except that I talked to them
            today at the hearing.

   jcompton> Spinner: I'm not sure what the relation of
            Chinese-to-Philippines labor costs are, but I'd imagine Chinese
            labor is a few degrees cheaper, at least.

       Cryo> unedited transcripts will be available from www.warped.com..
            edited ones will be elsewhere

       Zool> Spinner:  It will probably mean Slave labor, sadly.

       oleg> zool so why aren't we getting at least some "I don't know
            answers from you"? you CANNOT conceivably have covered every
            question asked here in your talk with ESCOM, soo how much is
            speculation on your part, and how much is ESCOM answers?

       Cryo> thank you all for attending.. we have some entertainment for
           you coming up

       Cryo> We are going to tie jason down and let you all come with your
            cow prods and have at him

   jcompton> Yeah, that about does it for the formal part, everyone.  Thank
            you very much for coming, the official edited transcripts will
            be appearing in the online magazine of your choice...

       Zool> oleg:  I haven't said that because I don't answer what I can't
            answer.  And yes, there is a matter of speculation inveolved,
            but it's the best that I can do with a 3 minute conversation.

      caldi> Cryo: Your butt would be better entertainment, put it in the
            fax machine.

   jcompton> All I have left to say is that I'm not about to watch Escom
            screw this up, so I'd appreciate all the help I can get making
            sure they don't.

   jcompton> Open up the floodgates...

       Cryo> *ding* *ding* *ding* this conference is officially over.

       Zool> oleg:  The best thing Escom said was "We wouldn't have spent 
            million and the time to buy the Amiga unless we wanted to make
            Amigas"

@next "RISC"
@prev "ad1"

     This was written a few months ago, so please don't e-mail me telling
 me that the Microsoft and Apple as campaigns took place months in the
 past!
 
     As you may or may not know, both Microsoft and Apple Macintosh have
 recently launched new advertising campaigns.  In Microsoft's they show you
 images of lots of 6 year old Caucasians with huge eyes and old Asians
 looking into the camera.  While you are seeing these sickeningly cute
 images in the background you hear supposedly awe-inspiring music and 
 subliminal messages (like "This stuff we make, it makes you powerful," and
 "Gather up your ideas, we can't wait to see what you do"), and
 occasionally, a glimpse of the Windows logo or some software.  In the
 Macintosh advertisements you see people trying to do various procedures
 with a PC and failing because it is so complicated, and then going over to
 a friend's house to do the procedure on a Mac.  After giving some serious
 thought to these commercials I began to plan the fantasy ad for the Amiga
 in my head (it's obviously a fantasy, for when was the last time you saw
 an Amiga ad period, let alone a good one?)  Some sort of mix of the Mac
 and Microsoft ads.  
 
     Yeah...that would be good...
     
     The ad opens up with a man trying to save the world from total nuclear
 destruction on his PC (not a game, it would be a real experience).  He is
 frustrated because the PC keeps saying:

 Not ready error reading drive B Abort, Fail, Retry?  
 Abort, Retry, Fail?

     He finally gets so frustrated that he calls a friend and asks him if
 he can come over and use his Amiga to save the world.  The friend is
 hesitant, telling him that he IS in the middle of computer chess, but OK,
 he can use his Amiga.  
 
      You see the man walk up to the door of his friend's house and walk in
 with his friend.  An image of the faces of a 6 year old girl with huge
 eyes and an old man appear on the screen for now reason at all, although
 it looks cute.  
 
     Suddenly a blinding light streams out from the room in front of the
 camera.  At the same time "Thus Spake Zarathustra" begins to play (you
 know, the song from 2001!) the man walks into the light filled room and
 sees the Amiga. (A bit like those cheesy Alien encounters on TV)  The
 music reaches a chreschendo and then switches from "Thus Came Zarathustra"
 to Hendel's "Messiah."  In the background you hear subliminal messages
 telling you to buy 50 Amigas.  The man sits down at the Amiga.  He begins
 to type away in an effort to save the world.  His friend approaches him
 and begins to use the mouse.  The man says, "Excuse me, I'm trying to save
 the world!"  
 
     "No problem," says the friend, "Amigas have had true multi-tasking
 since 1986.  
 
     The friend is visibly impressed as he watches his friend render in
 Lightwave as the computer works on stopping a nuclear missle countdown.
 
     The man is so overjoyed that you see him buy an Amiga and throw his PC
 out a window.  We come back to him three years later, and his formerly
 bald head now has hair on it, his teeth sparkle, and he lives in a
 mansion.  
 
     The ad ends with the new Amiga logo and a slogan that says:
     
         @{bg shine}The Amiga:  So Powerful it Will Grow Hair on Your Head@{bg back}
         
         
         
     OK, maybe there are some slight "exaggerations" in the advertisement,
 but really, the Amiga hasn't had an ad in America for so long that it
 should be excused for a few fibs.  
 
 
     Besides, Microsoft has been fibbing for years, and nobody's noticed,
 so why should it be any different for the Amiga?

                     Some  Bits  of  Treasure  Part III

                             by Brian Strayer 


     Soon after Armand left for the oasis, John and Tom retired to the
 Rover to eat and rest.  The long hours and this strange turn of events had
 left them exhausted.  They awoke late into the evening.
 
     Tom stretched and yawned, "Do you think he will get the tablets back?"
 "I don't know," John slowly replied, "But I've just had a thought." Tom
 waited, not saying anything.  He would almost rather sleep than get at the
 bottom of this mystery that was swirled around them.
 
  John continued, "I remember that some of the symbols on the last lines were
about duplication. I think there might be a copy of one of the tablets or,
maybe, even a new one."

     "But what about its location?" asked Tom, voicing the next hurdle.
 "Without the last tablet, how will we know where to look?"
 
  "Well, I may be wrong on this," John acknowledged, "but I think the symbols on
duplication also referred to it's location.  Let's go check."

     They grabbed the lantern and tools and headed to the chamber.  They
 had just set the light when the sound of a scuffle from the tunnel made
 Tom jump visibly. The boy entered with his head down.
 
  "How did it go?" John asked.
  
     Armand looked up, his disappointment apparent. "I did get your
 tablets.  But they were hid in a food bag, and I lost them to a big bird.
 I do not even know where they are now. I am sorry."
 
     John laid his hand on the boy's shoulder, "You did your best.  We
 appreciate that.  And we are certainly no worse off than before.  In fact,
 we were just going to check out something else."
 
     John briefly told him their thoughts of another tablet.  Several
 minutes work yielded a large pile of small rocks and sand, but no tablet.
 A second effort doubled the size of the debris pile, but still no
 artifact.
 
     "Maybe it is just a little deeper," volunteered Armand. A third time
 hands and tools went to work.  This time a small, flat tablet was their
 reward. 
 
     Tom quickly voiced the next problem, "How are you going to translate
 that without the laptop? All your data was in it."
 
     John arose, "It was.  But, remember, I did that printout just before
 we found the third tablet.  It's in the Rover.  I'll get it."

     Tom then brought Armand up to date on the tablets. John returned and
 started the lengthy task of translation.

     It was almost dawn when he finished and roused Tom and the boy. "Ok,"
 John began, "here it is.  This is a new tablet, not just a copy of the
 last one.  This one tells us when and how things will happen, though the
 'when' doesn't do us much good.  It seems they tracked time by a small
 particle, maybe a subquark, field decay rate differential.  Even if we
 knew the particle, the type of field they meant and how to measure it's
 decay rate seems way beyond me."
 
     "So what about 'how'?" asked Tom. "Well," John went on, "they knew, or
 planned, that the Commodore logo would be on a computer.  Entering this
 code would somehow let the Commodore symbol act as a lens for a remote
 apparatus that would begin the access operation.  The computer would also
 be a needed source of electrical energy."
 
     "Access to what?" Tom asked promptly. "I don't know, that was on the
 third tablet," John said shrugging.
 
     Tom voiced his doubts, "If this was some cheap dime novel, it would be
 a portal for large one eyed creatures to come here and wipe us out."
 
     "I don't think that's going to happen," replied John disapprovingly.
 "But how do you know that for sure?" Tom pursued with more vague
 possibilities nibbling at the edge of his mind.
 
     John said nothing, and continued through his notes. "Now," he finally
remarked, "all we need is one of those computers."

     Armand spoke up, "My friend in the village has an A500. He lets me use
 it whenever I want." "But is your friend there today?" John asked.
 
     "No," the boy stated, "He is gone for some days, but he lets me come
 in when I want. It is ok."
 
  "All right." was John's decided reply. " Let's pack up and go!"

               The Future Of The Amiga - My Opinion 
               
               
     So, another day has come and gone, and still we're apparently only
 another day left in the dark as to what is going on with our beloved
 micro.  In the meantime, PC's are surging forward with their technology -
 both in software and hardware.  It's sad to see how far behing the Amiga
 is now, compared to the massive lead it enjoyed a mere eight or nine years
 ago.  There is no question that these are dark times for the Amiga, but
 now that Escom has succeeded, what will they really be getting for their
 troubles (and money - Ed)?

     The operating system really is the jewel in the Amiga's crown.  That,
 above all else, should be preserved and improved upon.  Despite the PC's
 advances, the only two true pre-emptive multitasking operating systems on
 that platform are OS/2 and WindowsNT.  Try getting them to multitask in
 1MB of memory!  WindowsNT in particular, will load in 8MB, run in 16MB,
 but likes 32MB of memory.  Escom should be made aware of what they've got
 with AmigaDOS, and this brings me neatly to my next point.

     It is ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE that the new owners should move swiftly to
 the concept of a multi-platform machine.  It is no longer acceptable for
 an Amiga not to be able to run Word 6, Windows, CorelDraw or Quark Express
 when need be.  The PC platform will always have the biggest user-base, and
 no-one, no matter how good their system is, is ever going to touch that.
 A fast RISC machine could handle Motorola 680x0 and Intel 80x86 emulation
 at reasonable speeds - allowing users to select the operating system of
 their choice.  A re-write of AmigaDOS would be required (and at this
 point, long-asked-for extensions to Exec such as memory protection and
 virtual memory could be added) for this new system, which should be a top
 priority and developed in parallel with the new machine.

     Once all this is up and running, the AGA and AAA technologies which
 have been bought should be licensed out, to allow third-party
 manufacturers to bring out Amiga emulation cards for the "normal" PC's -
 allowing the millions of PC owners out there to run AmigaDOS on their PC
 and play Amiga games.  This would have a knock-on effect of raising
 awareness of the Amiga, and raising the profile of the new company
 considerably.

     With all this, you might be screaming that "this isn't an Amiga!" and
 "What about backwards compatability?".  To answer the first, the computing
 world is changing.  As PC's become more prevelant - its folly for Amiga
 users to hide themselves in their own little cucoon and pretend it doesn't
 affect them.  Standards are being drawn in the cut-and-throat bustle of
 the marketplace, and unless something is done, the new Amiga Corporation
 will be left out in the cold, the Amiga with it, and you and me.  For the
 second question, backwards compatability is frankly the least of C='s
 worries.  The Amiga is such a tiny market in the grand scheme of things -
 with the vast majority of Amiga owners owning out-dated ECS technology.  A
 suitable analogy might be the difference between a horse & cart and a
 motor car.  When the motor car was appearing, did horse and cart owners
 start yelling: "Why can't I fit a saddle to it?" "Why won't it shit on my
 lawn?" and "Why doesn't it eat grass ?".  The simple answer is: No.
 Technology moves on, and the sad fact of the matter is that you have to
 either keep up, put up, or shut up.  It's the whole idea behind computing.

     Developer support should be a priority also. The old Developer Support
 Program needs a serious re-think before it can be restarted.  First of
 all, software companies & individuals should be encouraged to develop for
 the machine, rather than discouraged as was the case in "the bad old
 days".  Autodocs and Includes should be available free of charge online,
 or from PD libraries to all who want them.  Technical support should be
 free for first time members for at least a year after registering.  It's
 no use trying to get people to commit to writing for a non-standard
 machine with a relatively small user-base when you demand an initial
 outlay to get going.  Once they've been developing for a year or more, and
 hopefully getting some money back from their efforts, then it seems fair
 enough to charge them - but not before.

     In short then, I hope desperately that at least some of these ideas
 will be employed by the new owners of the Amiga.  I've owned an Amiga
 since 1987, when the first A500's first started shipping this side of the
 pond, and a C= 64 before then.  Now I own a 486-DX2 66 also, and I see how
 far behind we are in terms of everything except the operating system.  I'm
 not overly concerned with fancy graphics, my life is not based on how many
 pixels I can fit on a screen, but I love the Amiga and I love the way the
 system is designed, and in order for it to survive, the new owners have to
 accept that the market is not the same as it was when the Amiga first
 appeared, nor is it even the same as when C= themselves went bust.  My
 dream is that in an ever changing world, it should be "Amiga", not
 "Microsoft" that springs to the mind of every layman even remotely
 interested in computing.

     Three passes of some gooey Mac chassis, with triumphant camera angles
 and high contrast shadows cast by two point source lights against a 
 backlit panorama of low hue photographs of apple crates which say
 "mackintosh" on the sides.
 
 
     Round about the middle of the second pass, you notice a blister and
 smoke rising from one side.  As the camera keeps rotating around, you see
 a strong lazer burning a huge hole in from the other side.  With some
 expensive transgressional warp, the camera chases over the beam of the
 lazer to an Amiga and the source, with a moving quote of "Since you saw
 your first lazer show at an amusement park you have seen what only the
 Amiga can do." read by some smoker-voice talent. Camera dips into the beam
 and flash cuts to a digitally generated "sea" of IBM PC-compatibles
 undulating calmly.  After a few oscillations, the sea is torn through
 perpendicularly by a rocket, blurring the scene with a "heat wave" 
 visual effect.
 
 
     In blackness, that same cancer-victim voice talent says "For 35 years
 there has been a cesspool of mediocrity in the world of personal
 computers. Fortunately for you, the universe is a very big place."  At
 this point, a well-rendered starfield has been faded in slowly.  The
 camera moves, banking to an angle perpendicular and up from the current
 view-point.  It follows this current direction and accelerates fast enough
 to turn the stars into rainbow lines (ala star Trek and laws of physics)
 with a triumphant musical arrangement lasting only a few seconds, the warp
 effect stops at a large black sphere blocking all but the outermost stars
 in view.  The sphere rotates and light is cast upon a planetary boing
 ball.

@toc "General"
@next "IRC"
@prev "Errata"

     This is a recount of what happened during the last two days of the
 Commodore Bankruptcy, and what other news has been announced since then.
 
     On April 20, the auction for Commodore took place.  Escom's starting
 bid of $5 million was the starting bid, not including the $1.3 million
 they had already payed for the Commodore trademark.  During the day, two
 other companies, Dell, a major American PC maker, and an American computer
 store, entered bids.  Dell's bid was rejected for having too many
 conditions, and the computer company didn't have the $1 million cash
 deposit neccesary.
 
     At 4 PM, the auction ended, with Escom's bid of $5 million the
 accepted bid.  However, Dell continued to work at their bid, and after 4
 PM entered a bid of $15 million, which also contained fewer conditions
 than their previous bid.  The bid did, however, have the conditions that
 Dell would be allowed 1 month to examine Commodore, and that if they
 didn't want it, they could "return" it, losing only their $1 million
 deposit.  They could also extend that period to 45 days for another
 $100,000.  
 
     The management teams of C= UK and CEI, the two most vocal groups
 during the long bankruptcy, did not bid.  It is believed that C= UK no
 longer had the money to bid.  CEI chose to cast their lots with Dell,
 perhaps because they had the money to win, but not to do anything with the
 Amiga after they won.  
 
     The next day, Friday, April 21, the lawyers for Escom, Dell, and the
 creditors were present at a court hearing.  There were approxiamtely 65
 people present, of which 5 were actual Amiga users who went simply to see
 who won.  Dell and the creditors made the arguament to the judge that
 Dell's bid should be accepted, because it was higher than Escom's bid.
 Escom argued, however, that that was unfair, for their bid had been
 accepted, and because Dell's bid had too many conditions, whereas Escom's
 bid was unconditional.  The judge, after hearing long hours of arguaments,
 ordered both sides to try to work out their differencs at lunch.  After a
 two hour break, all sides re-entered, announcing that they had resolved
 their conflict, as Escom had raised their offer to $12 million, still
 unconditional.  The judge accepted this offer and Commodore was sold.
 However, the Phillipines' plant and C= UK were not included in the deal,
 but Escom is expected to purchase these soon.
 
     A few days later the Bahamian Court approved the sale, and all was
 official.
 
     Since then, Escom has made it's policy to the Amiga much more clear.
 They have decided to allow their Amiga operations to be run by a company
 that they will be creating, known as Commodore-Amiga, Amiga-Commodore,
 Commodore-GmbH, or something similiar to that.  The company will be owner
 by Escom.  The head of Engineering for the Amiga will be Dr. Peter Kittel,
 a prolific poster on Usenet.  This is viewed by all as good news for the
 Amiga, as Dr. Kittel is very in tune with the Amiga community and as a
 "net-surfer", can make all the latest Amiga news known much freely than
 the old Commodore ever did.  Escom's press officer, Dr. Wirsing, will be
 the Head of Marketing at the new company.  
 
     The new company will have a starting staff of approximately 50,
 although that number will grow as money begins to come in from sales.  The
 Engineering department will be located in Germany, as will the technical
 support at first, although it is also expected to begin technical support
 in other countries as soon as money allows.  There are two general
 offices, one in Germany and one in the Netherlands.  No decisions on
 starting subsidiaries in UK, the US, or Canada have been made yet.  The
 company will be very liberal with liscencing of the Amiga technology to
 other companies for use in other products or in Amiga clones.  It is
 expected that CEI and MacroSystems will be the first clone makers.  The
 new company will also sell Amigas in any store that wants to have them,
 and not just the 1500 Escom stores in Europe.  
 
     Technical plans have not been made very clear yet, although we can
 expect much work on changing the Amiga CPU from CISC to RISC.  
 
     The A4000 and A1200 will be produced, but the company has not
 commented on the CD32 yet.
 
     All in all, this seems to be very good news for the Amiga.  We have
 people who know the Amiga running a new Amiga Corporation, people who are
 not just interested in milking the Amiga for all that it is worth.  We
 also have the support of Europe's second biggest computer chain, owner of 
 1500 stores!  And, best of all, we will probably see Amiga clones,
 something that many have been waiting for for a long time.  Who knows,
 someone could easily liscence the Amiga tech and work out a way to make it
 into a laptop, or a new game's system, or a new high-end Amiga!  The only
 bad news that I see is the small staff at the new Amiga corporation, but I
 hope that with time this company will grow much bigger.  I'm sure that as
 soon as money comes in from the Amiga they'll begin to hire more staff,
 and show Escom how important they could be to Escom's business operation.
 
     Let us pray.

Interview with Bernard van Tienen ESCOM.  Friday April 21, 1995 [van Tienen is a
former vice-president of Commodore International.]

by Josh Galun (JG) assisted by Giorgio Gomelsky (GG)

JG: How much can you say about your plans for the Amiga?

BvT: We are setting up a group of advisors to advice us which products we should
produce and we are digging into every product solutions not only Amigas but
other products like Commodore products, TV set-top boxes, we are considering
PowerPCs with Amiga, we are considering everything at the moment.

JG: How soon do you think you'll be able to have Amigas in production?

BvT: We haven't decided yet, but we have all the links with the factories. Escom
is a big European group at the moment, we assemble our own machines, we have all
the contacts with the manufacturers, we spoke already with them, the only thing
is which product should we produce, which quality an then we get started.  We
presume we'll have the first products, the first Amiga products on the market
within 3 months...

JG: As I understand it, ESCOM is one of the biggest computer-sellers in Europe,
I assume AMIGAS will be in all their stores, is that true?

BvT: Not only Amigas but we will also produce Commodore PCs, ja, and of course
we will use our own stores in Europe but besides that we will distribute
products into other countries and also to other dealers in Europe...

JG: The Amiga has a very vibrant community as well as many public domain
programmers, do you plan to use them in any way or contact them and ask them
what they think...

BvT: Of course, of course, ja...

JG: With the developers as well?

BvT: Ja, ja, everybody will be involved...as many as possible to advice us on
the Commodore and Amiga products...

JG: Do you plan to attempt to hire any of the technicians who used to be with
Commodore?

BvT: Of course, we are already busy with it and already have some contracts. But
a lot of Commodoore people are already working for ESCOM, for instance I was
vice-president of Commodore International, Peter Tachenko...  I think there are
already roughly 100 ex-Commodore people working for ESCOM at the moment.

JG: Do you have a position on whether you would license the Amiga technology and
software to clone-makers?

BvT: Not only to clone makers but also to people who want to produce products
and need some of our licences.  We are already busy with that, we've made some
principal contacts, ja, on that.

JG: How long have you been working to try and buy what was left of Commodore?

BvT: We started with it, let's see, eh, last year in August 1994.

JG: Had ESCOM been interested in the Amiga before the buy-out, in having Amigas
in their stores?

BvT: The point is that ESCOM.  ...must have lasted 3/4 years.  We sold Amigas in
the past in our stores...

JOSH TAKES A BREAK

GG: You are aware that the Amiga has a tremendously loyal following?

BvT: We know Commodore very well because I was vice-president of Commodore
International and I know everybody and everything about C= of course...

GG: Do you intend to use this energy that comes from the passion of the Amiga
users?

BvT: Of course, of course, the biggest asset is not only the name and the
products but also the user-groups.  There are millions of Amiga users and even
more 64 users still, ja.  We are also planning to roll out products in China and
other countries...

GG: How would you achieve this contact with the users?  Would you put up a site
on the Internet?

BvT: We haven't decided yet but everything is possible.  Also we would use the
magazines of course, there are hundreds of magazines, so ok, we haven't got the
deal yet, but as you heard in the court now it looks like we'll get the deal in
a couple of weeks, we have planned a lot but now we'll be able to roll it out,
ja?  So give us some time, ja, we'll consider everything...

GG: Could the users be in touch with you, say over the next month or so and
communicate their concern?

BvT: Ja, we will install people everywhere, in Europe, in the States. Call me
and I will tell you who and where they are.  We are aware of the frustrations
users had under the old management...

JOSH GETS BACK

JG: Do you have any plans already in place or being discussed with CEI about
working with them on the Amiga?

BvT:  We can't disclose that at the moment.

JG: Was C= UK part of the buy-out?

BvT (pointing at Colin Proudfoot passing by): That's C= UK...  "Ok, Colin, see
you next week, ok?" It's not part of the deal at the moment, but next week we
have an apoointment with C= to see what we can do with them.  We are talking
with them...

JG: Do you have plans to work with them or to possibly buy them out?

BvT: Both are possible...

GG: My main concern is for the users, this has been a long slog...

BvT: Yes, I think it is a good thing that finally there is this sale.  We
already wanted to buy last year, but we couldn't proceed, we couldn't hurry it
up, ja, it took so long...

JG: Can I ask you a bit of a personal question?  Do you own an Amiga yourself?
Which one"

BvT: I don't own an Amiga at the moment...

JG (smiling): But you're planning on getting one, yeah?

BvT: I,I,I..I've used Amiga in the past, ja, in my office.  I'll get a new one
that's coming out, we don't know what spec it will be, we are working on it hard
at the moment...

JG: Do you have any plans to have some online chats on the Internet?  Do make
more use of the Internet?

BvT: Of course the Internet is going around right now, it's very popular in the
States, also booming right now in Europe, so ja, something will happen...  We
will set up support groups to get to know what is going on all over the
place...

JG: Do you plan to make separate Amiga packages with software bundles, let's say
a Modem Package, a Game Package, as C= UK has done in the past?

BvT: It worked very well out in the UK, I know the figures because I was
involved and everything is possible...but we can also bring out other products
under the Amiga name, ja, we can also bring other technology into the Amiga, if
you want, ja, we haven't defined it yet but we are considering everything and we
expect a lot from Commodore and Amiga, otherwise we wouldn't have bought it,
ja?

Interview with Colin Proudfoot of C= UK

by Josh Galun

Missed first question

CP: C= UK is waiting for this thing to be over.  We then look forward to working
with ESCOM and reviewing their plans for the future of Commodore cause they're
gonna drive the technology and in effect they are quit likely to end up the
owners of the C= UK business.

JG: Do you believe ESCOM will buy C=UK as they exist right now or do you believe
they will license you as clone-makers?

CP: I don't think ESCOM will leave C=UK outside its organization, so it's a
technical question in acoounting terms whether it's expedient for them to keep
the corporate identity as it is today or create a new corporate identity or use
their existing structure and merge the C=UK within that. I think that was is key
is that they will retain a lot of the staff from the UK organization because we
have the expertise on the market place.

JG: If you were allowed to make your own plans for the UK market of the Amiga,
what would they be?  If ESCOM gave you that, how would market the Amiga and make
it viable again?

CP: I don't think that is a realistic question because if you look at the market
place as a whole you can't exclude the UK from the rest of Europe or the rest of
the world.  Computing nowadays is very much a global market and we would have to
fall in line with ESCOM.  A regards to what marketing plans we would see, David
Pleasance has outlined the plans he would have for the market place and the
products and how it would develop.  In fact he will be talking to ESCOM about
these things next week and we will see how many of those ideas they will wish to
adopt.

JG: So you're saying that there is nothing that separates the UK market from the
rest of the European market or the global market?

CP: Europe is now a common market and there are no technical bounderies for free
movement of goods and services so a product that's launched in the UK one day
we'll find in Germany the next day, or in Holland or in Danmark.

JG: I heard that C=UK has good developers' relationships.  Have you been talking
to them about the buyout and what information have you gotten from them that
might be helpful to ESCOM?

CP: Well the UK has a very strong software community and a lot of developers are
based in there and we've been talking to them throughout the buyout, we've been
discussing ideas for eventual new products and I think ESCOM will be very
interested in the discussion that we had and the results of those discussions.

JG: Is there any technology that C=UK has that has not been released or that it
still owns the rights to?

CP: C=UK has never owned any of the rights to the technology, it's merely been a
licensee.  All rights have always been held by CEL in the Bahamas or
Commodore-Amiga in California.  To come back to the developers, we recognise and
I think the ESCOM people recognise how important the relationships with the
development community are and on behalf of David and myself I wish to thank the
development community for their support over the last 12 months. It' been
absolutely tremendous, we couldn't have asked for any more support or any better
encouragement from the guys all around the world.  Hopefully we're looking
forward to working with ESCOM working with the developers' community and putting
the Amiga back on top of the market place, which is what we wanted all along.

JG: The US is a very competitive, intense and big market.  Do you think ESCOM
will want tto and are able to attack it properly?

CP: You should ask them.  I can only speculate and have a personal opinion and I
would say the following: ESCOM have been phenomenally successful as a PC vendor
in Europe and they have grown the business tremendously. Where do they go from
there?  They look to North America.  How they penetrate the American market?
Can they do it with a "me-too" computer? No they can't! So therefore they need a
product to differentiate themselves from the rest of the competition and just
maybe, just maybe, the Amiga is that product.

JG: What are your personal feelings about the end of the buyout?

CP: I'm very glad it's over!

JG: Are you an Amiga user yourself?

CP: I have a CD32 at home and in the office a Commodore 486 PC.

JG: Do you have any plans of switching to the Amiga?

CP: I am not a technologist I am a businessman.  What I do is I talk to David
Pleasance and the rest of the guys in the UK to get an understanding from them
about the technology and its applications.  My job is business.

@toc "General"
@next "Amiga-ad"
@prev "Interviews"
 This is a message of intent from Dr. Peter Kittel, Escom's new head of
 Engineering for the Amiga .

 
 Mr. Schmitt, Boss of Escom, has authorized me to publish the state of
 affairs.

 Most important item first: I have my job, and it's the of the world-wide
 boss of engineering. Yes, I know, I start into a very difficult task, as
 successor of real celebrities. OTOH I had eleven years time at Commodore
 to study what is the wrong strategy and which leads to success. I will
 spend all effort to avoid these known errors.

 And now for the big picture: There will be founded a new, completely
 selfstanding daughter company of Escom AG. It will have own rooms at an
 own address in Heppenheim. It will be the headquarter of the new company,
 with control and coordination for the whole world. One subsidiary will
 exist in any case in the Netherlands, and it will do Europe-wide
 distribution and sales. Further country subsidiaries are not impossible.
 Yet there are no concrete decisions about UK, USA, and Canada in
 particular.

 The new company is yet to be founded, but this is currently in the works
 with great effort. The name is not yet decided, it will probably be
 something like "Commodore-Amiga" or "Amiga-Commodore" or the like. This
 company will (at least for the time coming) care exclusively for the Amiga
 model palette.

 As can be inferred from the first paragraph, there will be an engineering
 department, for hardware and OS software. For this there exist already
 promising contacts with well-known and well-reputated names. Yet there's
 no problem if someone feels obliged to send his resume (no email or fax,
 please) to

 Escom AG
 Personalabteilung
 Tiergartenstr. 9
 D-64646 Heppenheim
 Germany
 
 You see, we consider ourselves an international company. Of course we only
 want the best ones :-).

 Further there will be a Support department which will do world-wide
 coordination, but also covers the german area. Thus most of these people
 should be german-speaking. The Amiga Developer Support Programm ADSP will
 get reactivated ASAP. About those developers currently using BIX or CIX,
 we have not yet decided. These people should feel free to contact me
 directly at this private account (no company one *yet* existing) and
 giving some input. In the past years there was a split among the developer
 community into different communication channels. Thus no direct
 communication of the developers among each other was possible, and for
 engineering this meant double work to explain the same issues once on one
 net and then additionally on another net. We will do everything to avoid
 this nonsense in future. There are big obstacles, as there are big cost
 differences in different regions of the earth, and simultaneously a 
 high degree of confidentiality has to be maintained. - Enduser support
 will happen mostly in electronic form, via mailbox, Internet, and probably
 also Btx.

 Of course there will be also a Marketing department and what is needed in
 admin. All together this will be a rather slim company of ca. 50 people at
 first, but a further expansion is of course not impossible.

 It is planned to restart production of the last current model palette,
 probably in full scale, but no guarantee yet for this. Also of course not
 all models will appear at the same time again, one after the other. As
 Escom has an own poweful casing production, they will perhaps get a
 redesign of their styling, in any case for the A4000, but the hardware
 under the hood remains unchanged at first. First diverse contributing
 factories on earth have to revive their production of parts. New
 developments would mean additional months of waiting, before you could buy
 the products. That would be too big a sacrifice.

 The direction of the new engineering department will definitely be the
 port to some RISC platform. The choice of this RISC is still open. There
 are ecstatic advocats for at least two alternatives, PPC and HP PA RISC.
 Chris Ludwig gave an interesting interview about this. It will be the
 first task of engineering to prepare this choice of paths into the
 future with all possible expertise.

 It has been decided to be very liberal in regards of licensing in the
 future. So, whoever wants to build e.g. an Amiga Laptop or a set-top box,
 can get chips and OS!

 As you all see, much of this is still a letter of intent. The points which
 are declared as still open are *really* open, so there's no use in
 bombarding me with further questions.

 As my work load, at least now in the building phase, will be immense, I
 can't guarantee my presence on the net like before. But who knows me,
 knows that that would be most painful for me myself. So let's look
 forward.

 In the next weeks there will be press conferences to tell more and more
 details.

 Long live the Amiga and for a good cooperation.

     As the immortal Opus of Bloom County once said, when it rains, it
 pours cats and dogs.  Nothing ever goes smoothly down at the Amiga Link
 Offices, and this month was no exception.
 
     To begin, I have some sad news to announce.  Because of disagreements
 between John Vlachos and myself, we have parted ways.  However, the split
 was not a friendly one, and John has refused to give up use of the Amiga
 Link name, and he is attempting to make his own Amiga Link.  If you happen
 to pick up his magazine (IF he puts it out), please understand that I am
 not affiliated with it if my name is not on it.  The quality of my Amiga
 Link will not change, as all the other writers and the mailing list
 coordinator is still with me, and because I have done all the editing in
 the past.  I'd also like to apologize to all the innocent Fidonet users
 who had to wade through the endless posts about this situation.  See?  No
 more posts! :)
 
     You might also notice that Amiga Link #3 is VERY late this month.
 The issue was almost complete, when just hours before I was going to send
 it out, my monitor broke.  My dealer could not repair it for 8 days, and I
 couldn't hook up my Amiga into the TV for lack of the correct adaptor.
 However, to make up for the late issue, Amiga Link #4 should come out
 early, most likely on May 15, so keep an eye out for it!
 
     Sigh...now I've gone and bored you.  Maybe this will wake you up,
 and although you probably know it already, here goes anyway:
 
         COMMODORE HAS BEEN BOUGHT!  THE BANKRUPTCY IS OVER!
         
     Wow...glad to get that one off of my chest!  Yes, Escom has bought the
 Amiga.  I for one, am very happy.  All the information on this is in the
 issue.  
 
     Anyway, look for Amiga Link #4 soon, which will have a real editorial,
 one which, unlike this one, will NOT be written at midnight while trying
 to get over a hangover...

     Sigh...it hasn't exactly been a great month for us, has it?  Last
 month, we forgot to include the following information:
 
     @{u}Jim Drew, Good or Bad@{uu} was written by David Sowsy, a man who has owned
 multiple Amigas and believes that Calculus is the root of all evil.  Now I
 ask you, has there ever been a more perceptive man?  David is known as
