@NODE edit "Editorial Page"
Well, I would like to say that the launch of the new newsletter went off
pretty well.  Although, it was not without a hitch.

The distribution sites received their copies a little late due to a
self-destructing modem.  My SupraFax v.32bis modem decided to stop working
as I was getting ready to send out the issues.  (I lost a modem to
lightning last year, this one just decided to quit.)  Rather than use my
backup 2400 bps modem, I waited a day and got a replacement for the modem
on the 3rd of July (already two days late).  The issues were distributed
without a hitch after that.

I know a few people tried to FREQ the first issue on the release date and
were surprised that they didn't receive anything.  Hopefully, this month
the issue will get there a little early to be on the safe side.

We're still looking for game reviews, game tips and anything else you'd
like to see included in the newsletter.  I know there's not much incentive
to write for us (it's not like we're paying anything), but if you feel
like writing something for us, we'd be glad to publish it.  Many thanks to
those that already have done so!

I've noticed a lot of other newsletters have popped up seemingly out of
nowhere.  I think that's good for the Amiga community as a whole.  I hope
that there's room for all of us.  I think we all compliment each other
because none of the newsletters really has the same focus.  Some are
narrower than others in terms of scope.  Some are all over the place in
scope.  It's a lot of fun to read them all and I hope you enjoy them as
much as I do.  Here's a tip of the hat to all those people out there 
putting the other newsletters together.

Well, I better get back to putting mine together.  I want to make sure I
make the deadline this month!

From:   Ken Pierce - "kpierce@age.cuc.ab.ca"
Subj:   SX-1 Review/A1200/CD남 Chip RAM

Hi there.

Just downloaded the latest edition (well, first edition) of Amiga
Entertainment Monthly and really enjoyed it.

I'm just writing this letter to correct a flaw in your review of the SX-1
adaptor for the CD남.  In the review, the author mentions that the Chip 
RAM in the Amiga 1200 and CD남 is strictly Chip RAM on a 16 bit bus.  
While it is true that the standard 2MB of RAM in a CD남 or Amiga 1200 is
strictly Chip RAM, it is not true that it is 16 bit RAM.  The RAM in an 
Amiga 1200 or CD남 is 32 bit RAM, and in fact, the only place 16 bit RAM
can be added to an Amiga 1200 is on the PCMCIA slot (which is 16 bit).  
Any belly boards will have 32 bit RAM, as the belly slot is a 32-bit slot.

The reason the machine shows such a significant speed increase (usually
around 2X) when Fast RAM is added, is the fact that the main processor 
(the 68EC020) doesn't have to wait for the custom chips (Alice, etc.) to
finish playing with the RAM before accessing it.  The 68EC020 can happily
chew away using whatever memory is above the 2MB of Chip, while the custom
chips fight amongst themselves (so to speak).  This slowdown problem (on a
machine which lacks fast RAM) is commonly referred to as "bus contention".

Another major source of confusion in the Amiga 1200 and CD남's memory 
addressing comes from the fact that both machines use a 68EC020 
microprocessor from Motorola.  These processors offer only 24 bit memory
addressing.  What this means, in effect, on an Amiga 1200 and/or CD남 is 
that only 10MB of total RAM (Chip+Fast) can be accessed.  This does not
mean, however that the memory being accessed is slower, it simply means
that the A1200/CD남 can not access any RAM above 10MB without the addition
of a 68030 accelerator (Which adds 32-bit memory
addressing).

It's confusing, I know, but the 68EC020 accesses 24 bits of RAM (16MB, 
with 6MB reserved) 32 bits at a time.  Baffled yet?  Good. :)

I just thought I'd try to clarify that point.  Thanks, and keep up the good
work.

@NODE THANKS "Thanks and Kudos!"
This month I'd like to thank all of the distribution sites for remaining
with the newsletter.  I really appreciate the support.

Thanks to all those that read and supported CD남View.  I really
appreciated the suggestions I recieved.

I'd also like to thank the few people that did send in their votes for
naming the newsletter.  Unfortunately, none of them really were what I was
looking for.  I think the new name gives the reader an idea of what one
will find within this newsletter, don't you?

This newsletter is created on Amiga computers.

It is worked on in various stages using an Amiga 2500 or an Amiga 3000T.
It all depends on where I am sitting at the time I'm typing...and I'm
always carrying a disk in my jacket with the most current version.

Software used: 

MEmacs, the editor supplied with every Amiga.  It's SIMPLY the best.  I've
tried others, but only MEmacs works for me.  Hey, at least I don't use ED!

Guide2Doc, by Bernd Koesling, is used to produce the ASCII/ANSI version

@NODE GAME1 "Impossible Mission 2025 Review"
IMPOSSIBLE MISSION 2025
SYSTEMS: ECS Version - Amiga 500, 600, 2000, 3000
	 AGA Version - Amiga 1200 or Amiga 4000 only
	 CD남
HARD DRIVE INSTALLABLE: Yes
MEMORY REQUIRED: 1 MB or higher
CONTROLLER: Joystick or Keyboard
Workbench 1.3/2.x/3.x compatible

Elvin Atombender is back!  The evil S.O.B. that tormented gamer's minds
and reflexes in the eighties has returned in a new game that combines
elements of the first two (Impossible Mission I and II) while adding some
new twists of its own.

You are given the task of getting through 15 levels to stop Elvin's latest
plot to destroy the world.  You can choose one of three different
characters to attempt this mission: RAM, a robot; Tasha, a gymnast; or
Felix Fly, a soldier.

Each level is full of obstacles, platforms, power-ups, sub-games and
killer robots.  The object is to find puzzle pieces (in the form of
circuit boards), assemble them in the correct manner and then move to the
next level.  To make things more difficult, you have to beat a running 
clock.

If you're familiar with the original IMPOSSIBLE MISSION games, then you'll
have a fairly good idea of what's expected of you.  If you're not, that's
OK, because Microprose has generously decided to port the original game to
the Amiga and include it in the package.  You're actually getting two
games for the price of one.

The CD남 version of the game includes some nifty intro animations, but
basically is not much different than either Amiga version.  The AGA
version looks nicer than the ECS version, but plays the same.  (The
original Impossible Mission looks the same on all three versions, but bogs
down on the CD남 when more than a few robots are onscreen.)

The graphics on all three versions of the new game are nice and rather
atmospheric.  The rotoscoped animations that depict your character's
movements are well done.  (They're not quite as good as those in OUT OF
THIS WORLD (Another World) or FLASHBACK, but they're good nonetheless.)

Actually, of the two games, I prefer the older version of the game.  Aside
from the "poor by today's standard" graphics, the gameplay holds up pretty
well for a game that's over ten years old.  The new version's flashier,
but I like the older one better.  That's not to say the newer game isn't
any good, it just looks a little bloated next to the lean and mean
IMPOSSIBLE MISSION.

@NODE GAME2 "Super Putty Review by Dieter Hirsbrunner"
SUPER PUTTY
SYSTEM: CD남

Super Putty is a platform game with a unique central character. You 
control a blue lump of putty (no, really!) as you bounce around 
platforms absorbing or punching enemies.   On each level you must absorb
a certain number of confused robots and bring them to safety.  Each level
has a time limit and the levels are broken up into several graphical 
styles.  Punching some enemies turns them into screaming babies which can
then be absorbed for points.  Absorbing enemies also keeps your energy 
level high.

The main character (Putty) has various abilites. He can walk, jump, 
stretch between platforms and absorb various characters. If you flatten
Putty , he cannot be hurt (keep in mind the clock does not stop when you
do this). Putty can even morph into certain other characters in the game
(the manual is not entirely clear on this.)

The backgrounds are colorful and there is a lot happening on each screen.
Using the composite output on the CD남 the quality was pretty good. S-VHS
would be better. There  are a lot of original characters such as samurai
spacemen, Mr. Hotdog etc. (check out the psychotic terminator carrots!) 

Sound is limited to an introductory tune and some very  nice in-game sound
effects (psychotic carrots screaming "Uzi nine millimeter!", wailing
babies, "Banzai" spacemen etc.).  There is no in-game tune , but I don't
miss one.

This game is not nearly as fast as Zool, but I like it much better. It 
holds my interest longer than Zool does; There  is some strategy involved
in saving the robots (In early levels the robots are stationary, later 
levels they may walk off a platform and die.)

I own a disk version of the game and use a suction-cup joystick. I like 
the CD남 pad controller better.  This may be due to the joystick I have
though.

DISLIKES : 
                
I could not put my name on the high-score table, perhaps a keyboard is
needed. there are no level passwords!  The game is fairly short, 4 or 5 
worlds with 3 levels each.  A password after each world would have been 
nice.

Supposedly the CD남 version has more levels but I have not been able to 
confirm this (I did not get far enough!)

@NODE GAME3 "Elfmania Review"
ELFMANIA
SYSTEM: Amiga 500 or higher
HARD DRIVE INSTALLABLE: No
MEMORY REQUIRED: 1 MB or higher
CONTROLLER: Joystick
Workbench 1.3/2.x/3.x compatible

Fighting elves?  Oh, well, I guess it's just as believable as the
scenarios in other beat-'em-up games.  The scenario here is a little
different than your standard beat'-em-up game, and so is quite a bit else.

The king of the elf kingdom of Muhmulandia is prepared to give up his
throne to the first person to beat six of his Champion Fighters and
capture six counties on a 6x6 map-grid of the kingdom.  Of course, beating
the six fighters doesn't mean he just hands over the kingdom...you have to
fight him too.

Throw into the mix the ability to hire an army of fighters (so you don't
have to control the same fighter throughout the game) and the awarding of
coins with which to hire these fighters and you've got an interesting
little game here.

Of course, I haven't mentioned the graphics yet.  They are the finest I've
seen in an ECS Amiga game yet.  The game looks AGA, but it's not.  Only
the graphics of STARDUST come close to the quality of those found in
ELFMANIA.  The sound, however, could use some work.  The music is 
repetitive and annoying.  The fighters sound like rabid chipmunks.

The only real gripe I have about the game is the control methods used to
do the moves.  I've played the game with two different controllers and
neither seemed to make controlling the game much easier.  I can only fault
the game for that.  It doesn't make the game unplayable by any means, it
just heightens the frustration level unnecessarily.

I can only wish that the game was in NTSC so that all American Amiga
owners could enjoy it.  If your Amiga can't do PAL mode graphics, you're
out of luck.  Of course, this would be an excellent reason to upgrade!

@NODE GAME6 "Quick Capsule Reviews"
This is a quick glance at some games I had a chance to play for a bit, but
didn't get a chance to do a complete review of:

THE LOST VIKINGS - (CD남)
A direct ECS port from the Amiga version.  Virtually nothing has been done
to the game to set it apart from its computer incarnation.  Although it's 
not a bad game, it's got two things going against it.  1) It's another 
platform game (albeit a more action oriented one) and 2) It's just as good
as it's Amiga version, not better.  It's still a lot better than some
"CD남" games, so it's worth a look if you don't have the Amiga version.

OVERALL RATING: 75%      Video Mode: NTSC


BATTLE CHESS - (CD남)
The CDTV version of this game gets a bit of a facelift in terms of
packaging and some slight changes in the controls.  Other than that, it's
the same game.  If you find the CDTV version cheaper and can live without
the slightly fancier packaging, you'll be OK with that one.  Otherwise,
this is a fairly good chess game with some humorous animation.  It's a
little on the slow side, but it's a solid, if rather old, game.

@NODE RATINGS "The Ratings - Explained"

We judge the games we review in four different categories:

Graphics
--------
This is pretty self explanatory.  The higher the percentile, the better
the graphics are.

Sound
-----
Another no-brainer.  The higher the percentile, the better the sound. 
Although, this also relates to it's coordination with the gameplay.  If 
the sound seems inappropriate for the type of game it is, the game will
score lower in the Sound category even if the sounds are technically well
done.

Gameplay
--------
The gameplay refers to the addictive quality of the game as well as the
way the game plays.  If you find your self sitting and watching rather
than interacting with the game, the game will score lower than one that
actually involves you.

Control
-------
This refers to how easy the game is to control given the standard CD남 
controller.  A game requiring a special controller that is not specified
or not included will be penalized.  A game that comes with a special 
controller or one that recommends that, say, an Amiga mouse might work
better than the standard CD남 controller will not be penalized.

@NODE LGTM "Lame Game of the Month"
This is an award presented to one game per month for being the worst of
that month's issue.  It's mainly to warn you, the consumer, about a game
that's REALLY bad.

If we have an issue with no really bad games...there'll be no award given.
A game that wins this award DESERVES to win!

THE LATEST ON THE COMMODORE BUY-OUT (Contributed by Mike Brantley)
-----------------------------------

    Here's a story on the Commodore situation that moved on the
Knight-Ridder wire service Monday evening (July 18). As of the mail packet
I just downloaded, no one else has posted this article in Amiga
International.

Lawyers doing battle over the carcass of Commodore International

By Dan Stets
Knight-Ridder Newspapers

   NASSAU, Bahamas -- Le Meridien, a graceful resort hotel on
fashionable Cable Beach, hardly seems a spot for a fight.

   It is a place of manicured lawns, swaying palms, sandy
beaches and emerald water. Travelers normally come here for the
relaxing pleasures of the tropics and fine dining at the
hotel's gourmet restaurant.

   But suddenly on Friday amidst the usual gathering of
suntanned women in bikinis and men in shorts appeared a small
army of two dozen lawyers, mostly men in dark suits bearing
overstuffed briefcases.

   They came to do battle over the carcass of Commodore
International Ltd., the once mighty maker of small computers
which had its North American headquarters in West Chester, Pa.
They came for the first official meeting of Commodore's
Bahamian committee of creditors.

   It is a fight over the company's assets, over the future of
its technology, over how much of its $145 million in debt will
be paid and, not surprisingly when lawyers get together, over
legal jurisdiction.

   Commodore, whose stock was traded on the New York Stock
Exchange until May 2, was registered in the Bahamas, and the
company initiated its own liquidation in the Bahamian Supreme
Court.

   The court-appointed Bahamian liquidators so far have
received at least four proposals to buy Commodore, including
one from the management team of its subsidiary in the United
Kingdom, the only one of the company's units still profitable
when the firm went out of business.

   The other suitors are Amstrad Plc., a U.K. computer firm;
Philips Electronics of the Netherlands, and Samsung Electronics
of Korea.

   But before there is a sale, lawyers for Commodore's
principal creditors would like to have the bankruptcy
proceedings moved or at least have parallel proceedings opened
in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.

   ``The biggest problem we are having is that the Americans
don't trust the Bahamians to do the liquidation,'' said Paul L.
Adderly, the attorney for the two liquidators.

   ``What can you do about that?'' asked Adderly in
exasperation. ``We are not entirely ignorant of these matters
in the Bahamas.''

   But lawyers for the main creditors see things differently.
It is not just the competence of the Bahamians they have called
into question, but the efficacy of Bahamian law.

   Under Bahamian law, a creditors' committee has an advisory
role, while under U.S. law, the creditors would have more of a
say over final disposition of the assets.

   Also, Bahamian law permits the liquidators to go back and
judge, and possibly reverse, management actions involving
assets three months before bankruptcy was declared. American
law permits a year.

   So far, the Bahamian court has rejected motions from the
creditors to have the proceedings moved to New York.

   Meanwhile, the creditors are seeking a ruling in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York to seize
jurisdiction or at least open parallel proceedings.

   The principal opposing creditors are Prudential Insurance
Co. of America, and a subsidiary, Pruco Life Insurance Co.,
both of Newark, N.J., which are owed a total of $28 million;
Anchor National Life Insurance Co. of Los Angeles, owed $5
million, and Daewoo Telecom and Daewoo Corp. of Korea, owed $15
million.

   The creditors have questions about actions taken by the
Commodore management team shortly before and right after the
liquidation filing in the Bahamas on May 2.

   They want to challenge management's transfer of a Commodore
unit from one subsidiary to another, and they have questions
about the conduct of Commodore's former president, Mehdi R.
Ali.

   Ali tried to get Prudential and Daewoo to agree to allow
liquidation proceedings to go unchallenged in the Bahamas in
return for a vague promise that they would get 50 cents on
every dollar of debt.

   According to an affidavit filed in the Bahamian Supreme
Court by Stephen M. Richmond, an attorney representing the
creditors' committee, Ali claimed he had a foreign buyer for
the company and the sale would proceed quickly if there was not
a legal tangle in New York.

   Richmond, a gruff Boston-based lawyer, said Ali refused to
tell him who the potential purchaser was or what the terms of
the sale were.

   Ali is no longer associated with Commodore.

   Reached Monday by telephone at his home in Ridgefield,
Conn., and asked for comment, Ali shouted, ``You're intruding
on my home. I'll complain to your editor. You're an idiot.'' He
then hung up.

   The Bahamian court-appointed liquidators are Franklyn Wilson
and McGregor Robertson, two partners in the Bahamian offices of
Deloitte & Touche, a major accounting firm.

   Wilson said Monday he hoped to complete the sale of
Commodore's assets ``very quickly,'' but he declined to be more
specific.

   Amid all the men in dark suits last week was a bearded,
casually dressed British national, David Pleasance, managing
director of Commodore's U.K. subsidiary and a leader of the
management team trying to buy all of the company.

   ``We might as well try. We have a good business in the U.K.,
a very good business,'' said Pleasance, who came to the Bahamas
to get to know the company's major creditors.

   If the management buyout is successful, Pleasance said
operations would be moved to England, but that the company
would like to keep research and development facilities in
Norristown.

   ``These are very good people,'' Pleasance said. ``We would
like to keep them.''

RAW ENTERTAINMENT LOOKING FOR INVESTORS (Contributed by Tony Belding)
---------------------------------------

A couple of weeks ago, Troy Silvey posted a message here about RAW
Entertainment looking for investors.  They are looking for $5,000 to $20,000
to carry them through three or four months until the magazine reviews of
their new games hit the streets.

A couple of days ago I phoned John Ingram, the president of the company, and
spoke with him at some length.  He said it would be fine if some wealthy
person were to offer up a $20,000 lump, but what he really hoped for was to
find more like 40 people who could each kick in $500.

In case you missed the earlier message, the plan is to repay the investment
plus 20% based on sales.  For example, a $1,000 investment would return
$1,200, payable when 1,200 games have been sold.  That should be in about
6-9 months, so you're looking at something like 30%-40% APR return there.

RAW Entertainment has been publishing wargames for the Amiga and PC for
quite a while now.  John said he does not expect much continuing sales from
their old titles, though.  They need to get the new stuff out.  He told me
RAW Entertainment is the only company left doing wargames for the Amiga.  As
far as I can tell, he's right.  If RAW Entertainment goes under, that's the
end of strategy wargames for us.

Now, here is what really got to me.  I waited a couple of weeks after the
original post appeared here before I called.  John told me how many other
people had called about that notice.  Zero.  Zip.  Nada.  Yes, I was the
only one who gave them a ring, the only one who expressed any interest at
all.

It's always been my experience here on FidoNet that people will talk about
doing a lot of things, but 9 times out of 10 it's just talk and no action. 
People here talk about supporting the Amiga.  What do they really DO to
support the Amiga?

Okay, I know most people here are not independently wealthy.  But there's
got to be a few this echo who could kick in $500!  I listened as John
explained his position at some length, and he struck me as highly
knowledgable and concerned about the Amiga marketplace.  I believe he knows
his business.  Don't take my word for it!  Give him a ring and chat with
him; form your own opinion!

I plan to put my money into this.  I haven't decided how much yet, but I
will participate.  I hope some others here will at least look into it.  That
number is (713) 286-2386.

@NODE RUM1 "AmigaWorld's 1-800 #"
This isn't a rumor, this is a fact!

AmigaWorld Magazine, with the help of its publisher, has set up an
information hotline to distribute information about the Commodore
liquidation.  

Call 1-800-441-4403 and ask for extension 365 to hear the latest
information about the Bahamian Supreme Court hearings.  (If you're calling
after business hours, simply type in 365 on a touch tone phone when 
prompted.)

Many thanks to AmigaWorld and TechMedia for setting this line up.  It will
quell a lot of rumors!

@NODE COL1 "Hardware Corner"
While we were planning to look at a lot of different joysticks and
controllers all at one time, we've had trouble getting a wide variety of
controllers to compare all at the same time.  We've decided to feature a
new controller every month.

This month we've got a look at a new controller for the CD남

	@{"Competition Pro CD남 Controller" link CPSC} - The Review!!!

@ENDNODE

@NODE CPSC "Competition Pro Super CD남 Professional Control Pad"
The CD남 controller is one of the most comfortable controllers to hold in
your hands.  Unfortunately, it's not so good at withstanding the demands
of rugged gameplay.  Since that's what you need in a good controller, a
replacement controller that meets those demands is definitely in order.

Enter the Competition Pro Super CD남 Professional Control Pad.  (Actually,
they could have just called it "The Better One".)  This 10 button, Sega
Genesis style controller gets high marks for design, comfort and quality. 
It also adds a few little things that the original controller doesn't
have: Slow motion, auto-fire, turbo mode and a one year warranty.

The pad held up well while being tested.  It didn't make me score any
better, but I did feel like the controller was responding to my directions
better than the original CD남 controller.
 
I played MICROCOSM and CHAOS ENGINE for the tests.  I tried out the
auto-fire, turbo and slow motion.  The "features" proved to be more
gimmicky than actually useful.  CHAOS ENGINE didn't respond well to the
slow motion.  It merely turned the pause function on and off.  The
auto-fire worked, but turbo caused my character to spin to the right
non-stop.  MICROCOSM was a little better.  Everything worked fine, but it
didn't help me play any better.  The slow motion "feature" is a little
misleading.  It slows everything down, including you, so that it's no
easier to hit or do anything...you just do it a LOT slower.

The controller feels a lot sturdier than the regular CD남 controller.  I
felt a lot more in control of games with it than I ever did before.  The
original controller is far too mushy.  The Competition Pro is tight and
quick to respond.  I highly recommend the Competition Pro Super CD남
Professional Control Pad.  I just wish they could have thought of a shorter
name!

Competition Pro Super CD남 Professional Control Pad is available from:
