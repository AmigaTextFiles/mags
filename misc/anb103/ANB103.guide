COMMODORE TO LIQUIDATE

Panic has been pumped around the nets in the past few days as Commodore International and Commodore Electronics announced a voluntary liquidation for the benefit of creditors.

Assets are being transferred to unidentified trustees, but reports say that only Commodore Electronics is going straight to liquidation while the other will continue operating - for a while.

Executives could not contacted after a statement was issued just before the weekend started.

From what we gather, many of the Commodore divisions around the world as still operating, but for how long is unclear.

Commodore stock had stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange when the company's worth fell below the threshold, with shares valued at less than a dollar each.

Several net writers say they have spoken with developer support staff who are said to be keeping their cool.

This decision shows that no buyer for the company has come forward prepared to meet Commodore's debts. Interested parties will make themselves apparent when assets including the Amiga technology are put on sale for creditors.

There is also the possibility of management buy-outs and the forming of a company which could go under the name of Amiga International.


HOW THE DRAMATIC NEWS UNFOLDED
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reuters flash:

RTf  04/29 1718  COMMODORE INTERNATIONAL <CBU.N> SAYS TO LIQUIDATE

@{b}REUTER@{ub}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PC PIONEER COMMODORE SIGNING OFF

Chicago Tribune (CT) - SATURDAY, April 30, 1994

WEST CHESTER, Pa. - Commodore International Ltd., a pioneer in the personal computer industry, said late Friday it is going out of business.

The company plans to transfer its assets to unidentified trustees "for the benefit of its creditors" and has placed its major subsidiary, Commodore Electronics Ltd., in voluntary liquidation.

"This is the initial phase of an orderly voluntary liquidation of both companies," Commodore said in a brief statement. Company executives could not be reached immediately.

The company last month reported an $8.2 million loss for the quarter ending Dec. 31 on sales of $70.1 million. A year earlier, Commodore lost $77.2 million on sales of $237.7 million.

In the latest report, Commodore said financial limits had thwarted its ability to supply products, leading to weakened sales. One of its new products, the Amiga CD32 video game, had sold poorly in Europe, where the company did most of its business.

The company's net worth turned negative in the fiscal year ended last June 30.

Its stock, which had traded at around $3 a share before the quarterly results were announced last month, closed unchanged at 87 cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.

Commodore started 40 years ago as a typewriter-repair company in the Bronx. Its extension to the adding machine business paved the way for it to make calculators and then personal computers by the mid-1970s.

Commodore competed with Radio Shack for the first computers sold to homes and co-founder Jack Tramiel became a highly regarded figure in the fledgling PC industry.

By the early 1980s, it was overshadowed in the PC business by Apple Computer Inc. and International Business Machines Corp.

@{b}CHICAGO TRIBUNE@{ub}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a reprint of a fax sent to CBM dealers from @{b}CREATIVE EQUIPMENT INTERNATIONAL@{ub} of Miami, Florida. They are one of the largest distributors of Amiga hardware in America:


Dear Dealer,
     
As we have been expecting, Commodore International filed for liquidation in order to be protected from it's creditors Friday April 29, 1994 at 4:10pm.

Commodore's official statement follows:

"Commodore International Limited announced today that it's Board of directors has authorized the transfer of it's assets to trustees for the benefit of it's creditor and has placed it's major subsidiary, Commodore Electronics Limited, into voluntary liquidation.

This is the initial phase of an orderly liquidation of both companies, which are incorporated in the Bahamas, by the Bahamas Supreme Court."

This action does not affect the wholly-owned subsidiaries which include Commodore Business Machines (USA), Commodore Business Machines LTD (CANADA), Commodore/Amiga (UK), Commodore Germany, etc. Operations will continue normally.

CEI has been working closely with Commodore's management and major investors to find a resolution to the current financial crisis. Commodore's actions now clear the way for PROGRESS to be made.

In the next few weeks CEI will be making a number of important announcements. CEI currently has sufficient Amiga inventory to meet expected demand until manufacturing can be resumed.  All our policies remain intact, full service and support will continue.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact your CEI representative.

Please assure your customers that this event should be seen in the positive light. What if... better support, better products, marketing, prices etc. all arose from the ashes.  Stay tuned...

President, CEI

First Annual Commodore Deathbed Vigil Party T-Shirts Available


We're writing to you from the site of the Commodore Deathbed Vigil party, April 30, 1994.  People are driving in from all over the east coast, some are flying in, AmigaWorld is sending a reporter, Dave Haynie, Gail Wellington, Intuition Guru Peter Cherna, Carolyn Scheppner, Jeff Porter, Andy Finkel, Bryce Nesbitt and dozens more are all here. The flag at the Commodore plant is flying at half-mast.

We ask you to dim your monitors to half-brightness in respect for the passing of Commodore.  Today is a day of world-wide mourning for the Amiga, and a day for prayers for a quick sale of the Amiga technology to one of the  several interested bidders. As hard as this is for all of us, we realize that only by cycling through bankruptcy could the technology be sold.

In the spirit of the great Amiga wake parties of the past we've just designed a Deathbed Vigil T-Shirt. It plays on the NewTek spin-off "Play" button, and Scala's "Fast Forward" shirt.  Ours has an eject button with the words "Commodore Deathbed Vigil April 30, 1994."  The back will be signed by members of the Commodore development team, most of the original Amiga design team, Commodore employees as of the last week and people of the party.

The shirt is $15 for partygoers, and $19 for anyone else. $4 shipping in the USA and Canada, $8 international.  We're using Obvious Implementation's order processing facilities (OIC is also offering a discount on the brand new DICE compiler 3.0, just released last week).

Call 1-800-761-2042 to order by phone.  Send email to "info@oic.COM" for an electronic mail order form.  Or send check or money order to:

Obvious Implementations Corporation, PO Box 4487, Cary, NC 27519-4487


 Bryce Nesbitt, Andy Finkel, John Toebes
                And the remaining staff of Commodore-Amiga
    Writing to you from the Commodore Deathbed Vigil, April 30 1994.

Also:  The all-new DICE C-Compiler, designed by leading Amiga experts,

TITLE

     Amiga Elm

VERSION

     3

AUTHOR

     Andreas M. Kirchwitz
     E-Mail: elm-fan@zikzak.in-berlin.de

DESCRIPTION

     "With AmigaElm you're always ahead of your time."
       -- Ralph Babel (author of "The Amiga Guru Book")

     AmigaElm is an "Electronic Mail Reader" which allows you to read and
     write mails. Normally you'll need a properly installed UUCP package
     (eg, AmigaUUCP, Feulner-UUCP or Dillon-UUCP) to reveive and send mails
     but AmigaElm is highly configurable so that you can take a mail-folder
     from a UNIX box, answer the mails and bring the answers back to the
     UNIX box.

     AmigaElm is easy to install and to use. The user interface is very
     intuitive and similar to the well-known UNIX-ELM. Beginners can
     control all basic functions with menus and some nice GadTools
     requesters (only with AmigaOS 2.0+). Usage with AmigaOS 1.3 is
     limited to keyboard control. Advanced users can use aliases,
     priorized message tagging, various filename-offers when saving
     messages and lots of options to configure AmigaElm to fit your
     needs. In a system with multiple users AmigaElm allows separate
     configuration files for each user.

     AmigaElm can be invoked in a special "terminal mode" (all input/output
     from/to console). This is useful for running AmigaElm in the current
     shell window or over a serial line (eg, with AUX-Handler).

     AmigaElm offers basic internal MIME (multimedia mail) functionality
     (eg, sending 8-bit-texts and binaries over 7-bit-lines) and supports
     "MetaMail" (a full-featured package for handling all kinds of MIME
     messages -- also available on AmiNet, see section "HOST NAME") and
     "ReqTools" library 2.x (reqtools.library is included).
     
     AmigaElm supports message encryption/decryption (eg, with PGP).

NEW FEATURES

     Changes since version 2:
     Encryption/decryption, secure mode, kludge for AmiTCP, Elm guesses
     optimum MIME-encoding mode, very short headers (optional), enhanced
     alias expansion, lots of enhancements to existing commands, various
     new features, bug fixes.

     Changes since version 1:
     Bug fixes, slightly enhanced user interface, various new
     features (commands, variables, configuration), noticable
     speed-up when reading/writing folder, terminal mode (for
     use with AUX or CLI), reworked alias-handling.

     (see file "History.Txt" for details)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     For normal usage: a properly installed UUCP package.
     But can be configured to run without a UUCP package for
     processing ready-made mail-folders (eg, from your work
     or university).

HOST NAME

     FTP/Internet: AmiNet and mirrors

       For example, ftp.wustl.edu [128.252.135.4].

    Batch Factory
    (C) 1994 Merlin's Software


VERSION:

    1.0


AUTHOR:

    J.L. White


DESCRIPTION:

                Liberate Your WorkForce With Batch Factory!

    Back in The Old Days when you wanted to batch process Images, Files,
    Anims, WorkBench Applications, you name it - you were forced into 
    the  drudgery of laborious typing, or creating scripts via utilities
    which were usually pure drudgery in themselves to operate (much less
    accomplish the other manual drudgery you were trying to avoid in the
    first place).  Well, these are The New Days and the Industrial 
    Revolution has replaced this Ancient Drudgery with the automated 
    efficiency of Batch Factory.  With Batch Factory you don't have to
    type buckets of scripts, you don't have to  walk ten miles through
    confusing utility docs, you don't even have to be in the room 
    supervising the laborers. You just point and click your mouse on 
    images or files you want to process (Select Some Stuff), point and
    click on the script or scripts you want to use (Select What You Want
    To Do With Some Stuff), and click on PROCESS (Do It).  At last, you 
    can let the machine turn the crank while you go have a refreshing 
    beverage. The best part is: Whether you're a beginner or a Wizard, 
    Batch Factory is geared toward your needs and is easy to use.

    Among the multitude of features and uses for Batch Factory are:

    *   Create Animations From Individual Frames
    *   Create Individual Frames From Animations
    *   Convert Images From One Format To Another
    *   Create StoryBoards Of Animations
    *   Composite Images Together
    *   Add Various Image Processing Techniques To Multiple Images
    *   Print Images And Text Files To Any Preference Printer
    *   Print Images And Text Files To Encapsulated Postscript Files
    *   Adjust Color Balancing & Palettes
    *   Process Images While Rendering In Lightwave, Imagine, Real 3D, etc.
    *   Print, Read, And Speak Files
    *   Copy, Move, And Delete Files
    *   Set Protection Bits
    *   Run Multiple Scripts At Once

        Merlin's Software accomplishes this latest feat of Magic with the
    help of ARexx. If you don't know how to write an ARexx script, don't
    worry - Batch Factory has got you covered. Over 200 scripts are
    already included. If you are an experienced ARexx programmer Batch 
    Factory will give you more applications than you can shake a script at.

    Software Supported For Batch Processing:

    * Amiga Dos             
    * Art Department Professional   
    * Cygnus Ed Professional
    * Final Writer
    * Image FX          
    * Image Master RT 
    * Morph Plus
    * Opal Paint
    * PAR - Personal Animation Recorder

DESCRIPTION

    D.A.S Module Player is a player designed for a high end users.
    Special attention has been given to efficient handling of modules
    in lists. Modules can be sorted and handled with such attributes as
    name(+reverse), date(+reverse), style and author. For better
    handling modules can also be divided to two groups within every
    list and can also be played according to those groups.  Adding modules
    to list is easy since DASMP can take care of already existing modules
    and modules newer than current list.
    
    Modules can be extracted from virtually any external archives such
    as LHA and ZIP. XPK and PowerPacker packed modules can also be used.
    
    Since DASMP requires MUI, the Graphical user Interface of the player
    is totally under user control.  User control over other features of
    DASMP can be squeezed to three words:  6 configuration pages.  Module
    specific configurations includes things like module duration, author,
    style and date.
    
    In overall DASMP is very complex system giving user a possibility to
    use features he needs and forget the rest.

    What DASMP is not: 
    DASMP is not small and is not ment to be a replacement for those cute 
    little players floating around nets. DASMP is not ment to be used on
    non accelerated a500 or a2000.

NEW FEATURES

    First in any multi format module player  DASMP presents S3M (Scream
    Tracker III) module support. S3M modules are modules capable up to 
    32 channels played while multitasking. New and improved EPL system
    guarantees better module handling than before.
    
    To put new features short: History file is about 3 pages long 
    filled with new, changed and fixed routines.
    

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS


    KS 2.04, WB 2.1, Magic User Interface 2.0 (MUI).
    MUI20USR.LHA is available on aminet. Older versions of MUI aren't 
    sufficient.

Subject: FPL version 7.0 REVISION

TITLE

     FPL -- a script/macro programming language.

VERSION

     7.0

AUTHOR

     Daniel Stenberg
     email:dast@sth.frontec.se
     FidoNet: 2:201/328

DESCRIPTION

     FPL is an interpreting script/macro language shared library, designed
     to be flexible and easy inserted in any code.

     FPL is a complete script programming language _very_ similar to C. If
     you are a software developer and plan to add any kind of macro/script
     control, consider the FPL alternative!

     The library lets the software programmer define functions that FPL
     should accept. The library will call a function in the software
     whenever any of these functions are used in an FPL program.

     FPL is distributed with extensive documentation and full source code. It
     has been successfully compiled under a large number of operating systems,
     in most of them as shared library.

     Features include:

     o Full ANSI C syntax statements with semicolon separations.

     o String, integer/long, char and short variables, including
       multidimensional arrays.

     o 100% ANSI C operator precedence and expression syntax.

     o C and C++ style comments. Optionally nested comments.

     o A subset of the ANSI C function declaration and prototyping syntax and
       concepts. The use of functions is exactly as C.

NEW FEATURES

     o A few, more or less sever, bugs removed.

     o Enhanced documentation structure.

     o [SunOS] GCC compiles should work.

     o switch() - extended C functionality. Handles strings and dynamic
       case expressions.

     o [Amiga] Funclibs: FPL now supports functions added by external third
       party programs. Add compiled functions to any host using fpl.library.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     The Amiga version requires at least AmigaDOS version 1.3 and runs fine on
     systems featuring 512KB and even less!

HOSTNAME

    Any Aminet site such as ftp.luth.se 
          (and also available by emailing the author).

DIRECTORY

    The file is named fpl70.lha, and resides in the

All of the text files in this archive have been filtered for the Amiga from
their original MS-DOS format, and icons with Tooltypes added so that Amiga
users can just click and go.  The Big Dummy's Guide has been converted to

Subject: Jade 3.0

TITLE

    Jade

VERSION

    3.0

AUTHOR

    John Harper <jsh@ukc.ac.uk>

DESCRIPTION

    Jade is the successor to my Jed 2.07 editor, the name has
    been changed because there is at least one other editor
    called Jed.

    A programmer's text editor, it is fully configurable with
    its own Lisp-style programming language (includes interpreter,
    compiler and debugger).

    All keybindings/mouse buttons/menus are configurable, with
    the Lisp files included in the distribution it emulates a
    subset of GNU Emacs.

    Jade supports the Amiga and Unix/X11 systems, full source
    is provided for both, a binary distribution is available
    for the Amiga.

NEW FEATURES

    New name.

    The old scripting langauge has been taken out, it's been
    replaced by a much more powerful Lisp-style language.

    Windows aren't restricted to displaying a particular file,
    the whole window/file thing is much more flexible -- any
    window can display any buffer, zero or more than windows
    be displaying a single buffer at any one time.

    Window redrawing is more efficient, scrolling is faster.

    Much more...

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    Version 2.04 or greater of the Amiga OS.

Subject: LharcUUCP 1.0 available for FTP

TITLE

     LharcUUCP

VERSION

     1.0

AUTHOR

     Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>

DESCRIPTION

        LharcUUCP is a small tool to speed your uucico transfers up.
     uucico's performance goes down, when you have to transfer plenty of
     small files, like e-mail and the corresponding description file.
     Larger files, however, are transferred at satisfying speed and
     efficiency--at least with a larger block size.

        The idea is to batch all your e-mail and to transfer this large
     file rather than all of them separately. Additionally, this larger
     file can be crunched much better than the smaller ones. Ideas like
     this are available for several years now, namely BSMTP or RSMTP.

        But these methods have one significant disadvantage: Once, the
     mails are batched, you can't add any files anymore! This means,
     that you can't run the batcher several times a day without having
     several smaller files again. And if you batch only a few times a
     day, you're stuck with certain poll-times.

        "So," I thought, "why not use lharc or any similar archiver?"
     These archivers can crunch the data very well and they can still
     add files at a later time. Additionally, lzh-archives are
     understood on virtually every platform.

        This is what LharcUUCP does! It scans your spool directory for
     queued jobs and archives them into one file using lharc. Currently,
     only mail- and news jobs are processed. Future versions might batch
     UUCP file transfers, too. Then an appropriate command-
     (`X.system*') and description file (`D.systemX*') is created--to
     tell uucico what to do with the archive.

        In case, such an archive already exists when LharcUUCP is
     issued, it adds the new jobs to that archives, *not* creating a
     second file to transfer!

        On the other side of the transfer, an uuxqt that recognizes the
     new job-type `rlharc' is required.

TITLE

  MainActor

VERSION

  1.5

AUTHOR

  Markus Moenig
  moenig@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de
  
DESCRIPTION

  MainActor is a modular animation package.

  It allows you to create,edit,time and play animations of the provided
  animation formats.

  You can convert any format into any other, allowing you to
  convert for example a range of pictures into an animation format
  of your choice, or resave the frames of an animation to an
  picture format, or simply to convert different picture formats.
  
  The following modules are included in this release:
  
  Animation Loader        Max. Depth         Animation Saver
  ----------------        ----------         ---------------

  Universal
  Universal_Merlin

  FLI                          8 Bit         FLI
  FLC                          8 Bit         FLC
  IFF-Anim3                    8 Bit
  IFF-Anim5                    8 Bit         IFF-Anim5

  Sound Players

  IFF-Sample

   
  New Features of Version 1.5 :
  -----------------------------
  
   - Major hd playback improvements of all modules. Average speed
     increase is about 2 - 5 times the speed of v1.2, giving you
     maximum performance.

   - Sound Support. MainActor now has Sound Modules which allow you to
     associate sound effects to every frame of an animation. This works
     for pictures too. The sound information is module independent, that
     means that you could use the same sound information ("#?.snd") on
     every module type MainActor supports.

   - New Real3D, IFF-Anim3, IFF-AnimJ, Picasso and AVI animation loader.

   - The usage of the Append function is now easier. The saver module
     now recognizes automatically if the destination project is of the
     right type. That means that you can now use the universal modules
     for appending.

   - Many smaller improvements.
   
  General Features:
  
  -Intelligent caching/tracking, MainActor can cache your animations and
   picture lists, if you have not enough memory it will directly access
   your data from any device. This makes it for example possible to
   create/edit/play a 400MB animation on your 2MB Amiga.

  -If you run OS 3.0 or higher, you will get an extra speed bonus on
   animations through the use of the new graphics routines.
   For OS2.0/2.1 users there are specific routines in the modules, which
   will give them the best playback speed possible on their system
   (and my knowledge :)).

  -Under OS 3.0 you will get the extra features of showing pictures or
   playing animations in a scrollable, resizable window on your MainActor
   or Workbench screen. The colors will be properly adjusted to your screen
   attributes.

  -MainActor has an arexx port, nearly all functions can be accessed through
   it. You can for example scale or dither whole animations through
   the use of an image processor, scripts are included.

NAME

    MUI Fido File Request 1.2

DESCRIPTION

    MUI Fido File Request is a GUI for selecting files from a filelist,
    which almost every Fidonet mailbox provides for download.

    The list of selected files is written to a .REQ-file in your
    outbound directory.

    The next time you call up your Fido Boss these files are
    automatically downloaded by your Fidonet communications software.

CHANGES

      in bytes and expected duration of transmission
      (suggested by Stefan Gybas)
    - two new environment variables MUIFFR/Outbound and MUIFFR/Config
      (suggested by Klaus Melchior)
    - bug removed: Filenames and passwords containing spaces inside of a
      .REQ file are not split in several parts any longer when loaded
      (reported by Matthias Scheler)
    - enforcer hit removed (WORD-READ), which appeared sometimes during
      startup
    - After a successful search the filelist listview gadget in automatically
      made the active object of the main window.
      (suggested by Stefan Gybas)
    - .REQ files, if present, are loaded from now on everytime the user
      selects a different alias.

HARD- AND SOFTWARE-REQUIREMENTS

DESCRIPTION

    `Phonebill' is, simply said, a logfile analyser. What it basically
    does is scan the logfile(s) generated by a terminal program or a
    mailer, extract all information about calls you have made by using
    your modem, and store this in its own (short) format. Features:

    * Requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher.

TITLE

     ReqChange

VERSION

     3.1

AUTHOR

     Magnus Holmgren
     Internet: cmh@augs.se
     Fidonet:  2:204/404.6

DESCRIPTION

     ReqChange is a program that replaces the most common requesters
     in AmigaDOS with the ones available in ReqTools.  This program
     is similar to RTPatch (included in the ReqTools distribution),
     but offers a lot more, such as a builtin "AssignWedge", the
     ability to send a Rexx message when a requester appears and
     several other options (for each requester type).

NEW FEATURES

  Version 3.0 is a a complete rewrite. The new features include:
     - Resident code written in assembler and stored in a .library.
     - Complete ASL V38 (OS 2.1+) support. Can "fall back" to the
       original requester when needed.
     - Rexx messages can be sent from any requester, based on
       type/title(/body text).
     - Prefs editor to edit all settings (including the "pre-denied"
       volumes and rexx messages) with font-sensitive GUI and online
       help. 
     - Smarter/smaller patching code.
     - Documentation in AmigaGuide format.
     - OS 3.0 aware (memory pools etc).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     OS 2.04 or better. ReqTools is also required, but it is included.

SHORT

     A very simple yet flexible revision bumper for C

FEATURES

     RevCo is a small utility to control versions and revisions of C
programs.  It can be run from the shell only and looks a lot like all
the other revision bumpers already available.

     Why would you use RevCo instead of any other revision bumper?
Well...  RevCo is a very simple yet flexible utility that has all the
features I like in a revision bumper.

     It generates an include file (.h) in which it stores the following
information about a C program :

   - name string
   - version number
   - revision number
   - compilation number
   - subrevision character
   - stage (alpha, beta, public)
   - date string
   - time string
   - AmigaDOS version string

Subject: RIPEM 1.2a-0

TITLE

        RIPEM -- RSAREF-based Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail

VERSION

        1.2a-0, Amiga port

AUTHOR

        Principal author of RIPEM is Mark Riordan (mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu).
        RSAREF 1.0 on which RIPEM is based is by RSA Data Security
        (rsaref-info@rsa.com).  The Amiga version is ported and compiled by
        Robert Knop (rknop@netcom.com).

DESCRIPTION

        RIPEM implements a filter to process messages as part of a
        public key (asymmetric) cryptography privacy-enhanced mail
        system.

        RIPEM is expected to be used primarily to encrypt and
        decrypt text to be embedded in electronic mail messages.
        However, it also has two "sign-only" modes in which an
        authentication check is added to the message, but no encryp-
        tion of the message itself takes place.  RIPEM can also be
        used to generate RSA public keypairs.

        The techniques and data formats used by RIPEM are as compa-
        tible as possible with Privacy-Enhanced Mail Internet RFCs
        1421-1424.  However, there is no support for "certificates",
        so RIPEM is not really compatible with PEM as described in
        those documents.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        The Amiga port of RIPEM should run on all Amigas.  It may not
        run with Workbench < 2.04, but then again, it might.  The executable
        is about 90K, and it requires a fairly large amount of stack space
        (32K), and may have trouble running on 512K Amigas (but has not been
        tested on such systems).  A separate 68030 version is included.

AVAILABILITY

        Ripem is available on the Ripem FTP site ripem.msu.edu as file:

                /pub/crypt/ripem/binaries/ripem-amiga-1.2a.lha

        Under US Law, RIPEM may not be exported out of the United States or
        Canada.  Anybody may ftp anonymously to the site to take a look at
        what is there, but only users in the USA and Canada willing to comply
        with export laws will be granted the ability to download certain files
        on the site.  For more information on getting access, see the file

                /pub/crypt/ripem/GETTING_ACCESS

        on ripem.msu.edu.

PRICE

        Free

DISTRIBUTABILITY

        Freely distributable; RIPEM is composed of a combination of public
        domain and licenced code.  RIPEM is licenced and unquestionably legal
        to distribute and use under U.S. Patent laws.

AUTHOR

     Randy Stackhouse, N4RTL
     EMAIL:  R.STACKHOUSE@GENIE.GEIS.COM

DESCRIPTION

       A satellite tracking program.  Allows for selection of a database
       that can contain up to 1000 satellites.  Tracks satellites on a
       graphics display of the world.  All graphics are IFF compatible
       allowing for loading of display to standard painting program.
       SatTrack allows for input of satellite data using either standard
       data format or by simple user input.  Satellite database files 
       are included, also information for obtaining database updates from
       public domain and government locations.   All operations use 
       standard windows and menus.  SatTrack has a simulation mode that 
       allows for predictions in the future.  Operates on Workbench 1.3,
       2.X and 3.X.  This is version 4.1. SatTrack is keyware, see the 
       registration file for more information.  SatTrack Demo is fully 
       operational until the expiration time is reached.

NEW FEATURES
    
       New for SatTrack 4.1
       Addition of support for various sized screens.  This allows for
       better support of PAL users and users with extended graphics
       cards.  
 
       Also included is Sun tracking which allows for calculation of 
       sun position.  Sun position is required to allow SatTrack to
       calculate the times when a particular satellite, shuttle or MIR
       is "in the sun" and you are not.  This determination allows the
       SatTrack user to predict when a space object is visible.

       Overhead view is a map of the sky from your location.   It is
       representative of where the satellite will travel within your
       view.   The display represents a circle.  The center of the
       circle is "up".  The outside circumference of the circle is
       your "horizon".  Another circle 1/2 the size of the other circle
       with the same center is the 45degree azimuth from your location.

DESCRIPTION

        The Twilight Development System (TDS) provides an integrated
        programming environment for writing and compiling source files
        like Turbo Pascal or Borland C++. The main program of the
        package is a powerful text editor called Twilight Editor (Ted)
        which includes an integrated project manager. This project
        manager simplifies and speeds up the development of programs
        composed of different source files (modules). With TDS it's
        possible to compile and link these modules into an executable
        file with a single command and if the compiler finds some
        errors, they will be reported directly by the editor. TDS
        doesn't provide its own compiler, but can use any compiler or
        assembler callable from Shell. It can interface directly with
        many common compilers like DICE C, SAS C, Lattice C, Aztec C,
        DevPac, A68k, PCQ, HCC, GNU-C, Amiga-E, Oberon and even
        programs like TeX, CatComp and MakeInfo. If the compiler is
        not supported, it's possible to write a little interface
        program to convert the error messages in a format readable by
        the editor. The compile process will be executed concurrently
        using another program called Twilight Make (TMake), so the
        user can continue to edit the source files while the compiler
        is working.

        The Twilight Editor (Ted) has many functions to support the 
        creating and editing of source files. The number of files 
        which can be open at the same time is limited only by the 
        amount of free memory and so is the length of a single text 
        file and line. For every file Ted remembers every change done 
        and allows an unlimited Undo and Redo. It also handles 
        horizzontal and vertical blocks (Cut, Copy, Paste). The user 
        can set and jump to bookmarks and search and replace strings 
        in the file. There is also a reference command to quickly get 
        information about autodocs functions and structure 
        definitions. Other features are complete customization of the 
        keyboard bindings, automatic saving, user selectable screen 
        mode and font type and an ARexx port.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        Twilight Development System (TDS) runs on any Amiga with 
        Kickstart 2.04 (V37) and greater.

     Fidonet:  2:285/312.0 (no routed netmail!)

DESCRIPTION

         XEchoGate is gatesoftware especially designed for use with Xenolink
      Professional Bulletin Board System 1.90. XEchoGate will gate messages
      written in Xenolink's messagebase directly to UUCP message by making use
      of the AmigaUUCP package. It'll also gates newgroups to fidonetareas by
      storing those messages directly into Xenolink's messagebase. Due to 
      Xenolink's *fast* performance it'll process those message *very* fast.

FEATURES

      o XEchoGate can be public as well as secure, messages are bounced when
        running in secure mode and user is unknown at your setup (both
        directions)

      o no real uucp msgs are needed, you can gate directly from and to
        Xenolink's messagebase

      o maximum configurability

      o really *fast* (aprox. 150 messages per minute)

      o can crosspost messages in Xenolink's messagebase if the original
        message was crossposted

      o can gate to UUCP only, to Xenolink only or in both directions

      o can put the messages in unknown newsgroups into a junksection

      o sends mail in a moderated newsgroup to the moderator in stead of
        posting it

      o can gate mail from a fidonet area to a mailinglist and vice versa,
        this area can be a known tagname or a junksection as well

      o can send messages from a echomail area direct to a email address
        whenever there is a TO: field at the first line of the message

      o seperate config files for :

                 -  general information
                 -  user information
                 -  area information
                 -  mailing lists

      o buffered log file

      o optional saving of gated emails as PKT in the inbound directory,
        saves up space for outbound netmails

                                 XENOLINK 1.90


               Next Generation Professional Bulletin Board Software
                     Copyright © 1990-1994 Xenomiga Technology


  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


             The principle upon which Xenolink has been designed:


            "If a QuickSort in C is faster than a Bubble Sort in
             Assembly Language, then let Xenolink be the QuickSort
             in Assembly Language."


  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


  It has been a year since the last release of Xenolink; Version Z.3a.

  In that year, Xenolink has been redesigned and completely rewritten, to
  incorporate the features that users have requested, and to support more
  ambitious features, some of which are already under development.

  Xenolink's efficient new architecture is now faster and more compact than
  ever.

  The changes are obviously far too numerous to list, but a brief synopsis
  of the areas affected is listed below:

      o Attractive AmigaDOS Release 2 interface
      o Vastly enhanced security features
      o Improved door support
      o Completely redesigned FidoNet support
      o Decrease in the already low usage of memory and disk space
      o Even faster operation than before

  Xenolink 1.90 has been tested as never before, by countless beta testers
  with setups ranging from Amiga 500's to 4000's, 68000's to 68040's,
  CD-ROMs, FAX-Modems, HST 16.8k modems, Point hosts, Network hubs,
  multi-line systems - the list goes on.



Overview
--------

   o Designed and written for AmigaDOS Release 2 and above
   o Superlative reliability
   o Very easy to use
   o Attractive interface
   o State of the art software design and system architecture
   o Full multi-line capability
   o Configurability to an almost sinful degree
   o Foreign language support
   o Highly efficient use of memory and disk space
   o Optimised high speed performance
   o Object Oriented library and door interface
   o Full XPR (External Protocol) support
   o Low CPU usage
   o Supports all serial cards and all baud rates
   o Uses Commodore's (GUI) Installer program for easy installation
   o Mature software; large amount of third party Xenolink software available
   o Large private support network linking together hundreds of Xenolink
     owners with Xenomiga Technology



Base Software Architecture
--------------------------

   o Xenolink Resource Handler controls access to all Xenolink resources
       - Avoids unnecessary disk activity if a resource (such as a message
         base or file area) is in use by more than one process
       - Crash protection; if a door crashes or hangs a Xenolink node, system
         data files and log files are preserved, even on the node that crashed
       - Automatic resource preloading enables Xenolink to asynchronously
         open files before they are required, thus reducing the bottleneck
         caused by disk activity

   o Memory usage
       - Dynamic memory and resource allocation
       - Xenolink and its accompanying utilities are residentable
           (extremely low memory usage for multiple nodes)
       - Extensive use of xenolink.library shared library routines
       - All executables are very compact
           (needless compiler overhead eliminated)

   o Disk space usage
       - Two files per message area, for unequalled speed and compactness
       - Three files per file area
       - Compact user data files
       - Real-time data compression used on compiled nodelist
       - Xenolink's compact data files have numerous advantages:
            o Very high speed operation due to the small number of files used
            o Minimises disk fragmentation
            o Data files are easily archived
            o Makes backing up very easy (very few files to back up)

   o Speed
       - Very fast implementation of fast algorithms (both are important!)
       - Enhanced Global Quick Indexing (EQDX) algorithms enable virtually
         instantaneous location of any file catalogue entry or user
       - Written in C and assembly language, using SAS/C Version 6
       - Any area requiring speed has been written directly in assembly
         language; this includes:
            o Screen/modem i/o
            o Mail processing parsing and i/o
            o Searching
            o Sorting
            o Hashing
            o Semaphoring
            o CRC checking

   o Ease of use
       - Only a few assign statements required
            o Xenolink does not require you to add countless assign statements
              to your startup-sequence
            o Location of all directories specified in "dir.config" file
       - Separate configuration files, stored in a single directory:
            o General/global configuration options
            o Node configuration
            o Message bases
            o File areas
            o User access templates
            o Bulletins
            o Archivers
            o External protocols
            o BBS text
            o BBS entry points
            o Access restrictions
       - FidoNet configuration files stored in a separate directory:
            o Node security (password, default protocol, archive type, send type)
            o Nodelist configuration
            o NetMail routing and forwarding
            o EchoMail area configuration (origin lines, feeds, passthrough areas)



Sysop Interface
---------------

   o AmigaDOS Release 2 interface
   o Different fonts (and different point sizes) supported.
   o Pulldown menus and keyboard shortcuts
   o Font/Overscan preference aware; most Xenolink screens size themselves to
     the largest size configured via AmigaDOS preferences
   o Automatic screen centering
   o Xenolink front end can open on any public screen
   o Can display all 256 characters in any font, including the international
     character codes 128-160, which cannot be displayed by the standard Amiga
     console or CLI
   o Full 16-colour high intensity ANSI support, on both the local screen and
     remote
   o Supports many IBM PC ANSI extensions not supported by the Amiga console,
     such as cursor save/restore
   o System configuration is stored in text files, for easy editing with either
     a text editor of your choice, or a Xenolink GUI program
   o Can change resolution and colours of screen while node is running
   o Up to 5 "favourite" resolutions/bitplanes can be stored for easy
     point-and-click retrieval



Security
--------

   o Logging of all node activity
   o Xenolink can automatically inform a user via mail whenever an illegal
     access attempt is made on his account; the user will be told the
     passwords used
   o User passwords are stored in the user file using a non-reversible
     encryption algorithm, so that if a hacker ever does manage to steal your
     user files, user passwords will be indecipherable
   o New user procedure requires that user passwords are at least 8 characters
     long and include both letters and numbers, to hinder brute force
     dictionary based decryption attempts.  New user procedure written in AREXX
     so this feature can be altered or disabled
   o Xenolink mail processor ensures that only specific systems can write mail
     in certain areas; Xenolink automatically sends a message to the system
     operator whenever a system attempts to illegally write mail
   o Packet level passwords used; Xenolink also protects against mail packets
     using an incorrect packet password (this feature can be disabled for
     individual nodes)
   o Xenolink FidoNet mailer logs illegal connection attempts, as well as the
     password used by the remote system
   o Password protection of any menu command
   o Xenolink prevents co-Sysops from moving messages/files from areas in which
     they could not edit/delete them, into areas in which they can
   o Registration file and log files are locked while Xenolink is running, to
     hinder hackers
   o Built-in protection against the mail unpacking hack which afflicted many
     Amiga BBS programs
   o Xenolink is shipped with Xenomiga Technology secured versions of UNARJ
     and PKAX
   o Protection against remote file transfers which attempt to send over
     complete device/path names or wildcard characters
   o Individual BBS lines can be configured to allow/prohibit
     logins/uploads/downloads from users at specified access levels/baud rates
     at specified times

   o Compact mode dispenses with the front end display, and shows node
     activity in a small window on any public screen you select (such as the
     Workbench)

   o Stealth mode dispenses with all displays, and allows a node to run
     invisibly in the background

   o ListNodes utility displays activity on all nodes in operation

   o FAX-modem compatibility
        - Xenolink can be configured to recognise incoming FAX calls, and to
          transfer control to a FAX handling program (such as GPFax)

A dark cloud has gathered over the Amiga's future, but now is not the time to start panic and worry about which machine to buy next.

Commodore may be on its last legs but the Amiga isn't. It has many years of life left and still a great potential for developments into all areas of visual entertainment and presentations.

Commodore are broken but Amigas round the world continue to operate.

This is a time when Amiga users need to shout up LOUD about their machines, why they love them, and why they are an ideal investment for any companies looking out for a firm stake in the leisure computing marketplace.

Hopefully it will just be a passing storm.
