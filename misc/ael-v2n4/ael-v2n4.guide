Editor's Corner             by @{"Lori Vinciguerra" link P6}

Well, the readership of the AEL newsletter has increased to about 75 people.
There are probably even more people reading it on the net that I can not
estimate. About 30 of you are receiving it by US mail.  I'd like to decrease
the 30 to keep down my costs, so if any of you have an email address please
let me know.

The first issue of the AEL (Oct. 1994) listed 17 schools that were using
Amigas.  Since then the list has grown to 99 schools!  The next person to
send me a school that is not already on the list will have the honor of
being the 100th entry!

It appears that someone else has had the same idea as me.  Basil Flinter has
started an Amiga Educator's Network in Australia.  See the "New Products and
Exciting News" section for details.

Word has it that Amiga Technologies has advertised on German TV.  Let's hope
that they are successful in their efforts.

Look for the upcoming issue of AC's Guide to the Amiga.  It will be
interesting to see if there are any new products since the last issue in
Summer of 1994.

The deadline for article submissions for the January issue is December 15,
1995.  If any of your students are interested in writing an article, please
pass on this information.  As always, email your article to
owl@davinci.reading.ma.us or use U.S. mail to send to OWL Software, 460
Summer Ave., Reading, MA 01867-3819.

Product: Tips & Tricks for The Talking Animator
Company: 3 Sons Software
         Box 1424

         V0X 1L0
E-mail:  barstewa@cln.etc.bc.ca (Barry Stewart)
Phone:   604-869-2635
Price:   Single-use licences $50 Canadian + $5 Cdn. Shipping and Handling.
         School site-licences $150 Cnd. (about $120 U.S.)
         District licences are negotiable
         A full money-back guarantee is offered, if you do not see the value
         in what you have purchased.

First a description of Talking Animator:

  Talking Animator is a page-flipping, talking doodle-pad. Kindergarten
  children can use it for one-page drawings. Older children can draw and
  have talking text on the same page.  But the real fun comes in the
  animation capability. The number of pages is dependant on the amount of
  RAM you have. 1 MB will give you 35 pages; 3 will get you over 100.  For a
  700 Kb program, this one is hard to beat for being simple and at the same
  time wide-open for creative minds.

  The program is becoming harder to find if you haven't already got it. It
  was created in 1990 by JMH Software of Maple Grove, Minn.

Now for Tips & Tricks:

  In 1991, the author's Special Ed kids won the International Grand Prize in
  Elementary Multi-Media productions from the Computer Learning Foundation
  of Palo Alto, California. Since then, he has guided students through the
  making of several even-better videos. Through thousands of hours of using
  the simple, yet open-ended software, most of its secrets can be uncovered.

  "Tips and Tricks for the Talking Animator" consists of 4, 880K disks,
  crammed full of tips from the very basic to multi-tasking with Amiga
  Vision for sound-effects. Also covered are 8 difficulty-levels of making
  video productions out of the animations.

  Other topics include:
        -making the Amiga speak French or other languages.
        -controlling the speed of the flipping.
        -using wipes to open and close animations
        -making the Amiga SING
        -dealing with clashing palettes
        -and many,many more tips...

  All of the files were made with the T.A. software -- so you load them and
  work with them through your own copy of T.A.

  Included with the disk set is a pamphlet listing 54 ways to use the
  Talking Animator at Home or School. (You can even use T.A. to drill for
  spelling, word-recognition and phonics skills!)

  On the back of the pamphlet is a skills checklist, covering 46 T.A. skills
  from basic to complex -- great for classroom use!

  Every T.A. user will find a lot of useful tips in these four disks. If
  your Talking Animator use reached a certain point and then fell-off
  because you couldn't push it any further -- these disks are bound to
  wake-up your creative juices. Even if you've only got a single-floppy 1Mb
  A-500, "Tips and Tricks" will show you how you can make a video animation
  that will last ten minutes or more!

@node P2-3 "New Products and Exciting News / The Amiga Education Network"
@toc "menu"

The Amiga Education Network (TAEN) was established nearly a year ago. The
purpose of The Amiga Education Network is to provide an Amiga-based global
facility - open to all persons or organizations with an interest in the
Amiga in the field of education in any country (through national
representatives) - through which information about the Amiga, relevant to
that country's education, can be disseminated and exchanged.

The reason that I established The Amiga Education Network was because it was
clear that Commodore had completely mismanaged the marketing of the Amiga
(which I consider to be the foremost education platform) in the education
market and that, if the Amiga was to have any chance of succeeding in this
specialised market in the future (presuming it had a future - which it now
appears to have), it needed:
  # To be divorced from the other areas of marketing and
  # To have input from educators who are using the Amiga and who appreciate
 that the education market is so specialised, it varies even from country to
 country.

I have written to Escom (Bernard van Tiernen), and to Commodore U.K. (David
Pleasance), about The Amiga Education Network, asking them to support it.
Hopefully, they will.I am a 69-year old ex-academic who, from 1982 to 1992,
was a Commodore Specialist and Education Dealer here in Australia. Although
I am now retired, and on the pension, I have - since 1992 (when I sold my
dealership) - retained my interest in (and enthusiasm for) the Amiga by
remaining active as an Amiga Education Consultant.The Amiga Education
Network is a non-profit organisation aimed at helping schools, with Amiga
computers, to get the most out of their computers. By increasing the Amiga's
education profile, increased sales should ensue.

Matters covered by The Amiga Education Network include
 # Offering advice on the latest Amiga software (including upgrades) and
 hardware (including peripherals);
 # Offering advice on the use of any Amiga hardware or software;
 # Offering advice on equipment appropriate to the enquirer's needs;
 # Supplying names of appropriate contacts;
 # Arranging for suitable demonstration(s) of, and training in, Amiga
 education product;
 # Publication of regular TAEN newsletters;
 # Identifying areas of need, and advising developers and publishers
 about them;and, most importantly,
 # Promoting direct interaction (including an interchange of ideas on
 how to use the Amiga) among schools/tertiary institutions and between
 individual teachers/lecturers/educationalists.

Each country that participates in TAEN will have its own National
Representative, whose role will include all of the the above, as well as the
following:

# To act as a point of referral, within their own country, as appropriate;

# To assist in developing and expanding The Amiga Education Network both
nationally, and through the Convener - internationally, so as to increase
TAEN's usefulness to those using it and to those developing product for it;

# To promote, and arrange for the assessment of, suitable Amiga education
product for that country;

# To arrange for the production of a regular Amiga-specific education
publication in that country;

# To liaise with the Convener so as to benefit the Amiga in education
globally; in particular, to advise the Convener of the special education
needs for that country.

The Convener - whose role includes that of global coordinator - can be based
anywhere.

Inner-City Arts is a non-profit arts organization which offers visual and
performing arts classes to the under-served, ethnically diverse elementary
school children who reside in the area of downtown Los Angeles known as
"skid row."

The mission of Inner-City Arts is to keep the spark of creativity alive in
young children facing extremely difficult circumstances while building
self-esteem and connections between art, school, family and community.

On September 22, 1995, Inner-City Arts will hold an arts festival to
introduce 150 new children to its facility.  As part of this Festival For
Youth, we would like to offer computer design experiences.  We are looking
for a donation of 12 Commodore Amiga computers and printers to be used at
the Inner-City Arts Center on September 22nd.  Any permanent donation is
tax-deductible, and will go directly to our budding media center where
children whose circumstances do not include access to such experiences, will
be able to make use of them.

For more information about our organization, event or mission, please
contact: Michelle Berne, Inner-City Arts Festival for Youth via e-mail:
InnerCityA@aol.com or at Inner City Arts: 213/627-6469.

      George Washington High School's Computer Art Program
    from "Virginia Alliance for Arts Education", Winter 1995
                     @{"by  Shirley Cadmus" link P8}

Imagine a room at George Washington High School in Danville that at
different times served as a closet, storage space or departmental office.
Today that room is home to the Computer Art Program.  Sixteen Amiga
computers representing the 500, 2000, 1200, and 4000 models are lined up
side by side aroung the small room.  Interspersed among them are two VCRs, a
camcorder, Singalodeon, Epson color flatbed scanner, NewTek digitizer, DCTV,
a drymount press, two Hewlett Packard Paintjet printers, a Hewlett Packard
Color Deskjet printer, a Fargo Primera thermal wax printer, a genlock, an
electronic drawing pad and a paper cutter.

At George Wahington High School, students are required to complete a year of
Foundations of Art before taking Computer Art.  The first semester course
involves making, modifying and manipulating still images while the second
semester is totally devoted to animation techniques.  A wide variety of
projects are assigned during the first semester to give students an idea of
how computer images may be related to any chosen career.  Students are also
encouraged to integrate the computer images with photography or works
completed in other art classes.  For example, paintings, drawings, collages,
etc. may be scanned or digitized, reworked on the computer, printed, then
further changed through mixed media.  Students may illustrate or animate a
poem for English, or an event for history class.  Both still and animated
images are recorded to standard VHS tapes, which serve as portfolios, and
may be taken home at any time and shown on TV.  Music, sound effects, or
voices can be added through the Singalodeon, and video images are overlayed
and blended with graphics by combining a camcorder and genlock.

Washington's program started in 1989 with the purchase of one Amiga 500, a
Hewlett Packard Paintjet printer and the NewTek Media Center.  I purchased
one of the first Amigas in 1985 after seeing a news story featuring Andy
Warhol using one.  Since I had no previous knowledge of computers, it
took me quite a while to complete my first picture, but I was hooked
immediately.  I began to win awards for my computer art works and had them
accepted in regional, state and national competitions. I realized that
students would also enjoy this new art medium, so I wrote a curriculum
proposal, gave talks and demonstrations to the local art league and examples
of my work to school administrators.  Finally convinced that a computer
COULD be used in the art room, my principal helped secure the funds.

The Amiga was located in my art room where I principally taught ceramics.
Students took turns using it and became instantly addicted.  Students
experimented with the "Paint" program and digitized everything in sight.
They came in before school, during lunch and kept me after school several
hours every day.  That first year students won Gold Key awards in regional
Scholastic Art competitions and the highest award on the national level.
Students were accomplishing more than I had ever imagined.  "Deluxe Paint"
added animation, and I had to start learning all over again.  I was not
prepared for the excitement that came when students found that they could
make images move!

The second year students again won Gold Keys and a national award.  Seeing
the limitless possibilities and overwhelmeing student interest I reworked
and added to the curriculumm proposal.  I met with the Secondary Curriculum
Coordinator, who had previously been an art teachrer.  He got the proposal
approved by the School board and helped obtain the money needed to buy
enough computers to have a class with 12 students.  Each semester the number
of student requests doubled.  The school board continued their support by
providing money for hard drives, additional equipment and software/hardware
upgrades.

I provided inservice training for all art teachers in the system, and when I
received newer models, the old 500s were given out to each art teacher.  As
a result, computer art is included in every art class from middle school
through high school, and a six-week exploratory computer art class is now
being taught in the eighth grade.

An additional art teacher was hired this year.  I am now teaching four
classes of computer art with 16 students in each both semesters, and even
though all four of us are teaching five full classes, we cannot accommodate
all the requests for art.  More students are considering careers in art than
ever before.

Starting a course such as I have described here takes a considerable amount
of time on the part of the teacher.  As most of us are right-brained rather
than analytic in nature, it takes much courage and determination.  One must
look at this machine as an art medium rather than a typewriter or
number-cruncher.  It is VERY helpful to have the same computer at home,
because it is impossible to experiment with, develop lesson examples, and
master the machine during a planning period at school.  It is important to
provide students with top notch software and hardware right from the
beginning so that there is always a feeling of discovery rather than
frustration, which may turn them right off to computer art.  To keep abreast
of what is going on in the field, such as new software/hardware
developments, I read several monthly magazines religiously, such as "Amiga
World", "Computer Graphics World", "Verbum" and "Computer Artist".  Two
books I highly recommend are Deborah Greh's "Computers in the Artroom", and
Lillian Schwartz's  "The Computer Artist's Handbook".

I strongly recommend using computers in all art programs.  There are endless
opportunities for individuals having knowledge in this type of image making.
Students should be given the opportunity to learn to create, manipulate,
interpret, and otherwise become familiar with computer-generated images so
that they may apply this knowledge to any number of future endeavors.
