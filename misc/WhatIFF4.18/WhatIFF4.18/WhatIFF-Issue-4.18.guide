============================================================================

Hello and welcome to the December 2025 issue of WhatIFF?, it is hard to 
belive that we are soon ending 2025. It seems that each year passes more
swiftly than the last. So much has happened this year with regards to world
events and the Amiga, as such I am happy to say we have a suitably packed 
issue for the last one of the year.

Firstly, thank you to everyone who contributed to this issue and over the 
year, the magazine would not be exist without your hard work. 
                                                                      
This issue has been put out in record time of two months instead of the 
usual four months so it is more surprising that we were able to get as much
content as we did. For interviews we have five this issue from Edwin van den
Oosterkamp the creator of BassMX, Zooperdan, Aiden Holmes creator of the 
PCMCIACD driver, Electric Black Sheep and Alinea Amiga Shop. Reviews of the
PicoWyfy, BassMX and retrospective review of the Blizzard MKIV. We have lots
of guides and articles from our regular writers and someone even sent us in
a letter!

With 2025 coming to close we have much to look forward to, TheA1200 launch,
more stock of the A6000, AmigaOS 3.3 and the continuing drama of the 
Commodore aquisition, already while writing this I can see new drama 
unfolding online with legal cases being brought against other companies with
the Commodore name.

Thank you to everyone who has been downloading and reading the magazine, it
always gives me a boost to hear from you and I make sure to forward your 
comments onto the regular contributors.

Finally I have to apologise for the music playlist this issue, due to a lack
of contributors I had to make all the music myself. Hopefully next issue we
can get some decent and professional sounding music again.

For those of you who read this section, thank you and I wish you a most 
Merry Xmas and a happy new year. See you on the flip side!

Hello Timo,

You ask for our Amiga Storys in the new WhatIFF Amiga Mag. so i just feel to
share my Amiga Story. Written on an A1200 (hope it works) with YAM and
gmail.

When i was a Kid about 7-8 Years my Dad got on Xmas an C64 with Datatape
(without any Games). He was at a friend and saw some Games on the C64 and
was so happy about that. My Mother buy him a C64 for Xmas but for me it was
the first time to see a Computer. Before i only saw some Computers at Movies
etc. so over the xmas days we had only the C64 Manual with some Basic
Programms of a flying Ballon with a C logo. No Games at All but it was so
crazy to write something and get a result on screen. It was Magic, later i
buy Games on Tape and play on the C64 of my Dad. He did nothing with it
really, maybe playing a Game sometimes.

I got a real freak and buy later a Disc Drive and copy floppys with friends,
like Teenager do. Then we got slowly Informations about the next C64 (Amiga)
and it was crazy to believe what it should do compared to our C64.

So i got one of the early 1.3 Amiga500 for my Bday, and there was a
tankmouse inside. I never use a mouse before ? but it look funny. I build it
up and call some friends if they got any Amiga Games, then they just came
with Maniac Mansion and Shuffelpuck Cafe. Mansion i know already from C64
and i was total impressed with the high graphics on the Amiga. Shuffelpuck
was a mouse game and it was difficult to use a mouse. At end i was happy, so
i did learn to use a Computer mouse. I still play this Game sometimes just
for the Nostalgic feeling.

Later i upgrade a secound drive for less disc changes, an memory expansion
for Games that need it. Hell it was a great time, we feel part of something
big coming. We feel like pioneers of Computers, speak our language about
RAM, ROM, Chips and meet people at Conventions. Mostly i had the Problem
like you, i was very Young at that time so people did not tread me serious
at begin.

CHAPTER II

Later people switch to PC as Commodore was going under like Magazines show
PC Games and the CDROM was coming forward. So like my friends i switch and
the Begin till Pentium3 times we had much fun, lan Partys and playing Quake,
Unreal Tournament all this games.Starcraft, WarcraftII and even Shadow
Warrior had a Multiplayer.

2023 i was at a point that no PC Game brings me joy anymore, PC Games got
into Survival/Building Games to Farm hours of real Time to build something
like a House. It feel more like Work after Work ! Guilds demand you to be
online on specific Times to Raid something. I did not feel happy anymore !

So my Gamer PC got OLD and i had to choose to upgrade the PC for NextGen RTX
or do something complete other... So i decide to buy myself the A1200 that i
never had but always wish for and switch from PC back to Amiga for 700Euros.
Yes i read in your mag about "Amiga get out of reach" but i just had to buy
it and a New PC Gaming Rig would be more.

Maybe this is a strange Story becouse most people want to read about the
"past" and not the "now" but Amiga is Still active and People are coming
back.

So i install everything with more Luck as Brain :) Workbench 3.1 wow never
saw that and how many things changed. Then AmigaOS 3.2 came out right in
time for me. The learing curve was not so high, i remember startup-sequence
and other things back from the days. Also there was much new Software out
between 1995-2024 things i never hear of, or could use of demands. Like
Amiga Writer a tool i use many times, Photogenics a HD Paint/Photo Programm
(i just remember Deluxe Paint), Apdf Amiga can read PDF ? wow great. Wonders
over Wonders what all happend in the Time i was on PC. So many modern
Programms like Internet Protocol and iBrowser, YAM, FTP Programms and even
Videoplayers for Mp4.

I think this time it was even better as in the Past, i wonder so much about
the modern Amiga 68k ! Doom, Duke3D, Descent so many Games and still Games
coming like SettlersII or small indie Productions from Users. I think the
best Amiga Time i have right now in 2025. No Joke! i got a PiStorm on my
A1200 and everything flows like butter. It feels like a modern PC but on
Amiga such experiance i had never before and it makes me smile everyday new.

I know PiStorm is not liked by every Amiga User but to upgrade now to a PPC
Turbocard, RAM, PCMCIA Network, HDMI Out, RTG is JUST NOT PAYABLE at last
here in Germany. So the PiStorm is a easy and cheap way to get on that Level
without paying a Mercedes for Upgrades.

I search on ibrowser for Mod Pages and Download Music, New Mod Music and
play them in Hippo while doing stuff. Like i scan over Wlan on my Brother
and can upload it directly on my Router Drive (256GB USB Stick) my Amiga can
access the FTP of the Router and i can Download my Scans, then i open them
in Photogenics and resize them smaller for better work performance. Crazy or
? i can upload documents to the Router and Print them over Mobile Phone,
there should be a way to script automatic Printing but i'm to noob for this.
It hears compilcated but when you do it 20-30 times, it just is a matter of
1 minute.

Just wanted to say everything works and for the rest i own my Mobile Phone
like Youtube. I rencode mkv to divx and can watch movies on my Amiga over
FroggerNG. Mp3 over AmigaAmp. Well what else do you need ? WHDLoad brings
joy of classics and 68060 Games are running smooth on the PiStorm.

So under the line, i would say i'm a very happy Person now ! More happy as
with PCs or Classic Amiga, i love the amiga workflow or just listen to a Mod
on my Amiga while reading a Comic in PDF format. It relax me, it make me
feel nostalgic warm and doing something on Computer is FUN Again.

PS: Im German so excuse my English, i just learn School English but hopefull
you will understand the meaning even without correct typo.

Kind regards

Mike Swat

@{b}Shell Talk@ - PiStorm Ponderings@{ub} - by: @{"ByteBandit" link bytebandit}
============================================================================

It's funny how the Amiga scene moves in cycles. One minute we're all arguing
about the purity of ECS versus AGA, or whether WHDLoad counts as "real" disk
usage, and the next minute we're bolting Raspberry Pis onto our motherboards
like some sort of cybernetic Franken-Amiga. Yes, I'm talking about the 
mighty (and sometimes *too* mighty) PiStorm.

Don't get me wrong: the PiStorm family is an incredible technical 
achievement. The fact that a tiny ARM board can mimic a 68030, 040, or 060 
faster than anything Commodore ever dreamed of is mind-bending. The 
PiStorm32 Lite for the A1200 pushes things even further, letting people jump 
into RTG modes, crank up absurd resolutions, and even run old PC software 
through emulation layers that make your faithful 68k blush. It's *amazing*. 
But it's also¦ well¦ a little bit weird.

Somewhere along the line, the original soul of the machine starts to slip
through our fingers. When an A1200 is suddenly running Windows 3.1 apps at
warp speed, displaying 1080p desktops, and pretending to be a retro PC, you
start to wonder whether you're still using an Amiga or just a Pi with a very
large and nostalgic dongle hanging off it.

And then there's the cost. For the price of a PiStorm setupâ€”Pi, SD card, 
power, adapter, riser boards, cooling, and all the bits and bobs you *swear* 
you won't need until you do, you could run UAE on a PC, a laptop, or even a 
standalone Pi with far fewer headaches. They'll run the same software, often 
faster, and in some cases with better compatibility. So the argument 
becomes: if what you want is raw speed and convenience, why not just go full 
emulator and spare your vintage hardware the stress?

The thing is, the Amiga has always been about the *experience*. The whirr of
the drive. The feel of the keyboard. The odd little quirks that only real
hardware gives you. The PiStorm, in all its brilliance, risks flattening that
experience into something more generic, something powerful, yes, but also 
less distinctly Amiga.

Of course, some users love it. And fair play to them! It's their machine, 
their desk, their retro future. But as more and more videos pop up of people 
running old PC software on their PiStorm-boosted A1200s, using RTG to reach 
resolutions that would make a Picasso IV weep, it starts feeling like the 
line has blurred a bit too far. When your Amiga spends more time pretending 
to be a 486 than it does running Deluxe Paint, you might want to ask 
yourself whether you're augmenting the machine¦ or replacing it.

Maybe I'm old-fashioned. Maybe I like my Amigas like I like my coffee: warm,
slightly unpredictable, and definitely not pretending to be a PC. But as the
PiStorm revolution races ahead, I find myself hoping we don't lose sight of 
why we kept these machines alive in the first place.

Power is fun. Speed is fun. Running Doom at 200 FPS on an A500 is hilarious.
But the heart of the Amiga was never about raw horsepower. It was about the
unique mix of charm, design, and creativity that no other machine had.

So enjoy your PiStorms, just don't forget to let your Amiga be an Amiga 
once in a while.

New Mirari PPC motherboard for AmigaOS4 and MorphOS !

@{b}So, what is Mirari PPC?@{ub}

It's a soon to be released PowerPC motherboard being produced by a small 
team of Dutch Amiga fans who also happen to be hardware engineers.They 
named the new PPC motherboard Mirari which translated from Portuguese 
means miracle (based on a small team delivering new PPC hardware in the 
Amiga verse nowadays is truly a miracle!)

@{b}What are the specs of this new board?@{ub}

Form Factor: micro-ATX compatible
Dimensions: 244 x 170 mm (L x W)

CPU: QorlQ T1042 multi-core processor (up to 1.6 GHz)

Memory: DDR3L SODIMM, 1.35V

    Type: DDR3L SODIMM
    Voltage: 1.35V
    Speed: Up to DDR1600
     
Expansion Slots:

PCIe x16-4 lanes occupied (PCIe 2.0)
PCIe x4-1 lane occupied (T10x2 PCIe 2.0)
PCIe x1-1 lane occupied (PCIe 2.0)

Storage Interfaces:

SATA: 2x SATA 2.0 (T10x2 only, 300 Mbit/s)
NVMe: 2x NVMe slots (one slot mutually exclusive with SATA)

Additional Features:

USB Ports: USB 3.2 Gen1
FPGA: Onboard FPGA for additional functionality
Operating System Support: Compatible with various PPC Linux distributions, 
AmigaOS 4, and MorphOS

@{b}What's the release date?@{ub}

According to news from AmiWest in the US and Amiga40 in Germany all hardware 
prototypes are completed. Linux and MorphOS are running fine and the 
AmigaOS4 team is working on the kernel and drivers. The estimate release 
date is mid 2026.

@{b}How much will it cost?@{ub}

Between 500-600 euros

@{b}Why should you buy this?@{ub}

1. You loved your Phase 5 PPC back in the day and you still love Amiga :-)

2. You're old PegasosII, micro AmigaONE, or AmigaONE G3-SE or XE can't be 
fixed anymore or you want a quicker system and also use a modern video card.

2. It's half the price of currently available PPC hardware from A-Eon 
(AmigaONE X5000) and also approx. 300 euros cheaper than the SAM460ex from 
ACube Systems.

3. Overall speed wise it's approximately 75% of the AmigaONE X5000/20 
system.

@{b}Still interested?@{ub}

                @{IMG "Images/blizzard1230_1_small.iff"}
@{b}Introduction@{ub}

In the late 90s I was lucky enough to get a few Phase 5 boards.  I spent a
lot of time reading various magazine reviews, adverts and going over the
specifications and performance figures, this was going to be amazing and I
couldn't wait!  They weren't cheap and it took a lot of summer job income to
afford them but I was always impressed with their quality and just how much
of an upgrade such boards provided.  One of those boards was the highly
recommended Blizzard 1230-IV for the Amiga 1200, the fourth and final 030
board. In later years Phase 5 sold the rights to DCE who continued to
manufacture and sell the board, in some cases with a different RTC battery.

The Blizzard mounted a PGA 68030, PGA 68882, a 72 pin SIMM socket and a real
time clock on an A1200 trapdoor accelerator card - a common configuration
but the Blizzard also had an edge connector for an optional SCSI card as 
well as a refined design.  There were various configuration options from a 
plain 030 board with an empty SIMM and FPU sockets to 030 CPU + 68882 FPU + 
SCSI Module and up to 256 MB RAM in two SIMMs - one on the board and one on 
the SCSI card - It takes a 70 ns or faster module up to 128 MB in size per 
socket.
                @{"Blizzard Front" link Images/blizzard1230_2_big.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/blizzard1230_2_small.iff"}
I won't go into too much detail on the SCSI card but if you're interested
here's an excellent article by Steven (Lyonsden Blog):

@{"https://lyonsden.net/blizzard-scsi-kit-mkiv" system "openurl https://lyonsden.net/blizzard-scsi-kit-mkiv"}

@{b}Hardware and Installation@{ub}

My Blizzard came with a 50MHz 68030, 50MHz 68882 FPU and an empty SIMM 
socket. I bought a 16 MB SIMM from a local computer shop - If you didn't buy 
the card with a 68882 or SCSI module you could always add them later but you 
should always add RAM.  There are two jumpers on the board, one for RAM 
timings (for a 10% speed increase if using RAM faster than 70 ns) and one 
jumper for enabling the built in MapROM function.  Everything else is set 
automatically.

There is also a rechargeable lithium coin cell battery soldered to the board
for keeping the real time clock going.  Mine didn't leak (they don't tend 
to), it could even still hold a charge!  Jan Beta has a video detailing how 
to replace the battery should you need to:

@{"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sdXLAXbpfQ" system "openurl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sdXLAXbpfQ"}

The board arrived in an appropriately sized black corrugated cardboard box
with a nice black cardboard sleeve bearing the Blizzard logo and 
specifications.  Inside the box the board is wrapped in an antistatic bag
and cushioned with foam padding, there's also a 12 page instruction manual
in German and English.  There's no software included as configuration is
handled by autoconfig and jumpers, though you should probably make sure you
have the 68030 and MMU libraries.  I vividly recall that Installation was 
both exciting and rather nerve wracking, after carefully upending my A1200 
and removing the trapdoor cover I took the Blizzard out of the antistatic 
bag and laid it on top (of the bag) and added the SIMM in preparation. You 
don't have to open your A1200's case but looking back it might make it 
easier if you do.

After placing the card in the A1200 and lining it up (there's not a lot of
space, it's a tight fit) I recall pushing it firmly and nothing happening.  
Do I have it the right away around?  What other way could it possibly go?  
After some self doubt, nervous wiggling and more pushing it finally slid 
home!  I put the trapdoor cover back on and plugged everything back in. 
You'd think after over 25 years and lots of computer building I'd be less 
apprehensive about doing it now but it's still a little challenging.

@{b}Software and Performance@{ub}

The manual states that the board provides a "400% to 500% performance 
increase" and "significantly accelerated graphics".  I eagerly powered the 
A1200 and it booted fine thankfully, quicker too and with a whopping 16MB 
Fast RAM showing in Workbench!  The first thing I did was...  SysInfo!  
Then AIBB for the beach ball test, I remember being absolutely thrilled at 
the results. It works!

Results will vary from computer to computer but expect MIPS scores in 
the high 9.x range and Dhrystones over 9000.  After benchmarking I put it 
through its paces with VistaPro, Real 3D/Imagine/Cinema 4D, DPaint/PPaint
ImageFX, Brilliance, Wordworth - It's odd how you remember these things but 
it was such a cool experience, like having a brand new Amiga!  I used the 
computer for games and productivity fairly equally so of course I 
appreciated the performance boost in more demanding games.  I used to play 
Gunship 2000 and Wing Commander quite a lot and the Blizzard really helped 
there. When Alien Breed 3D 2 was released it even came with a promotion for 
a Blizzard 1230-IV (or 1260) in the game box!  Apparently "Blood flies 
faster in a Blizzard"! This was the card to have, well, until the 1240/1260
/PPC boards came out anyway.
                @{"Alien Breed 3D 2 Promotion" link Images/blizzard1230_3_big.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/blizzard1230_3_small.iff"}

@{b}Summary@{ub}

That Blizzard served me well, never gave me any trouble or overheated.  In
later years it and my A1200 ended up in a Micronik Infintiv tower case 
and ran Linux in addition to Workbench.  Well I really had no desire to 
switch to Windows!  Recently I rehoused the A1200 back in its original case 
as the tower had yellowed horribly in places and was always rather flimsy. 
Thankfully the computer booted first time, the Blizzard was still functional 
and aside from some slight label peeling it looks brand new!  I've decided 
to use that A1200 as it was in my bedroom growing up - complete with the 
Blizzard. Hopefully it will continue to provide the same performance boost 
for a quite while longer after 20 years in storage!  

I'm very glad I kept hold of it and my other Phase 5 boards, they've shot 
up in price recently and you're lucky to get one for less than the price of 
an A1200, never mind the SCSI kit.  If you happen to find a good deal or 
come across one hiding in an A1200 then absolutely grab it, you won't be 
disappointed.  However, the reality is a modern accelerator like the TF1232 
or even the TF1260 with a full 060 may be a more cost effective choice - 
you might not get a real time clock but you'll get 128 MB of RAM, FPU and 
an IDE interface.

@{b}Note on finding a 68030 or a 68882@{ub}

Unfortunately it's getting harder to find a legitimate 50 MHz 030 or 68882
FPU.  Most of what's for sale seems to be reconditioned used components that
ended up as electronic waste for "recycling" i.e. cleaned/relabelled.  
Perhaps resellers think customers want shiny chips that look new, rather 
than accurately marked chips that let us know what they're actually rated 
for.  So expect that many of the 50 MHz units are quite possibly relabelled 
chips which may have originally been any frequency up to 50 MHz - although 
later mask revisions typically tolerate this.

I'm going to do an article on this problem after my experience trying to 
find an original 50 MHz 68882 but in the meantime here are some resources 
for mask/date verification:

@{b}Pros and Cons@{ub}
+ Excellent build quality.
+ Great expansion options including SCSI.
+ Probably the best original 68030 accelerator for the A1200.
+ Up to 128/256 MB Fast RAM!
+ Built in MapROM function and memory access speed option.
+ Speed!
- Expensive, more capable newly built options are available for around the
  same price.
- A bit of a tight fit.

@{b}Other Key Points:@{ub}
* Many continue to function well even after 3 decades but you take your 
  chances.
* RTC clock battery probably needs replacing.
* Finding legitimate 50 MHz 68030 CPUs and 68882 FPUs can be difficult and a
  little expensive.
* Later boards manufactured by DCE may have non-rechargeable RTC batteries.

@{b}Review@{ub}

About two years ago I reviewed the A314-cp for WhatIFF? and gave it a very
favourable review. In my opinion it was the most convenient and easiest way 
to get your Amiga connected, at the time. The developer of the A314-cp 
Niklas Ekstrom released a new project, the PicoWyfy last year. It is a 
wireless network interface controller (WNIC) that uses the Raspberry Pi
Pico W and connects to the Amigas clock port, like the A314-cp.

So, how does it differ from the A314-cp? To begin with it might be a good 
idea to revisit the A314-cp and what it does. When I had covered the A314-cp 
I focused on its ability to provide WIFI access without too much hassle. 
However, it is not only a WIFI adapter, you can use it as a file server, MP3 
decoder and access the Pi's command line interface. In this regard the 
A314-cp allowed you to use the faster CPU of the Pi for some Amiga tasks.
 
While not in the same vein as the PiStorm it still allows more than pure 
WIFI access.

The PicoWyfy in this regard, is a different kind of beast.  It is a more 
refined product with a focus on providing easy and fast WIFI access in any 
Amiga with a clockport.

After having enjoyed the A314-cp I was interested to see how the PicoWyfy 
compares. At the moment it is only possible to purchase it via the A314 
Discord channel by contacting Niklas. He was quick to reply and very 
helpful to any questions I had. Payment was by PayPal and he provided fast
shipping with tracking.
                @{"PicoWyfy Image 1" link Images/PicoWyfy_2big.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/PicoWyfy_2small.iff"}
It took about a week for the parcel to arrive and came packed in a padded
envelope. So, if you order becareful to check your mail box as it is easy
to miss it, like I did. While the enevlope was smaal, the PicoWyfy is tiny! 
The A314-cp is not a big card by any means but the PicoWyfy takes it 
further. 

When I first got my A313-cp, I had some troubles setting it up and connected
to my router. It involved editing files on the Raspberry side and then 
copying the necessary files and using a static IP address. While it is easy 
with hindsight, for one who has not done any networking on the Amiga it can 
be a steep and frustrating learning curve. I am happy to say this time  
Niklas has made it as painless as possible. 
                @{"PicoWyfy Image 2" link Images/PicoWyfy_3big.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/PicoWyfy_3small.iff"}

                @{"PicoWyfy Image Installed" link Images/PicoWyfyIn_1big.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/PicoWyfyIn_1small.iff"}
@{b}Installation@{ub}

To begin with I made a fresh install of Roadshow and deleted any files 
related to my previous installs of A314-cp and Wifipi. I then copied over
the files from the Picowyfy archive that can be found here:
@{"https://github.com/niklasekstrom/picowyfy" system "openurl https://github.com/niklasekstrom/picowyfy"} contained in the archive are four 
files:

        @{b}File name@{ub}             @{b}Location for files@{ub}
	---------------------+--------------------------
	* picowyfy.device    |	DEVS:Networks
	* PicoWyfyCtl	     |	C:
	* picowyfy.config    |	DEVS:
	* PicoWyfy	     |	DEVS:NetInterfaces	

Once you have the files installed you can set up the TCP/IP stack, and I 
recommend using Roadshow for this. It is still the best way to get your 
Amiga online due to still having support and the added benefit of speed.

Where as with the A314-cp it was recommended to use a static IP address the
PicoWyfy works best with DHCP, and this is very easy to setup with Roadshow.
All you need is to set up the access point for the PicoWyfy. This is 
accomplished with PicoWyfyCtl programme, which should be kept in the C:
directory. You can use the following commands:

	* status	prints status of the network adapter
	* scan		scans for wifi networks in range					
	* connect       connects to your chosen network
	* disconnect    disconnects from the current network

It is incredibly easy to set up, for example if your router's name is 
'AmigaX' and the password '1234', all you need to type is:

	PicoWyfyCtl connect AmigaX 1234

It will connect right away, with no hassles or issues. At the moment it is 
not possible to save a favourite network, however it is simple enough to add 
the above line to your startup sequence. 

	C:PicoWyfyCtl connect AmigaX 1234 QUIET

QUIET was added as I did not have it pop up a Shell screen informing you of
connection.

If you use a clock port expander the PicoWyfy can still be used as long as
you enter the correct port address in the 'picowyfy.config' file in Devs.

@{b}Overall Impressions@{ub}

Getting your Amiga online in the past involved many steps and configurations
with the advent of the A314-cp and Wifipi the entire process has been 
greatly simplefied. The PicoWyfy has made it even easier taking out many of
the steps that were necessary before. Now all you need to do is install
Roadshow, copy the files to the proper locations, enter your router details
and away you go.

Before getting the PicoWyfy I was using a PiStorm and tried Wifipi but ran 
into numerous issues. It was a pleasant surprise when the PicoWyfy arrived
and I was online in under 5 minutes. If a dunce like me can get online with
out issues then this card is fool proof.

So, it is easy to install but what about the speed? I achieved download 
speeds of 579kB/s and upload speeds of 383kB/s. This was done with the 
AmiSpeedTest.

So overal not too shabby. 

It may not be as speedy as the Wifipi but the PicoWyfy works with ease where 
as the Wifipi is known to have issues connecting to certain routers. There 
have been other users who have reported speeds of 1MB/s but this was when 
copying a file over a local network. Saying that, the card provides enough
download bandwidth for downloading files from Aminet, using YAM or surfing 
the web in IBrowse.

One thing I should mention though is that the card can cause the Amiga to 
freeze under certain circumstances. I found this to be most common if 
playing a game from Workbench. It seems that it is an effect of the card 
is connected to an access point and waiting for packets. The freezes are
random and can even occur when running AmigaTestKit, this happens when
running memory tests. However, if you shutdown the PicoWyfy the freezes
disappear and you can run your games or AmigaTestKit without issue. If you
are using Roadshow it can be accomplished by typing the following into the
Shell:

	ConfigureNetInterface PicoWyfy offline

With this command all my freezing issues disappeared, once your are finished
gaming and are back in Workbench, you can reboot or type in the same command
but instead of 'offline', use 'online'.

	ConfigureNetInterface PicoWyfy online

I must thank the people on the A314-cp channel for helping me with this as I
was under the impression my Amiga had failing Chip ram.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

Finally we have a network interface that is easy to setup and works like you
hope would. Niklas has created a top product that deserves much recognition
for being as close to a plug in and play solution for net connectivity you 
will get on classic Amigas. Combined with Roadshow this is in my humble
opinion the best way to get online, no other solution comes close to the ease
and stability as the PicoWyfy.
to create.

*A Few Words from Niklas Elkstrom*

Finally please have a look at his github to find out about other projects 
Niklas is working: @{"https://github.com/niklasekstrom" system "openurl https://github.com/niklasekstrom"}

During a chat on Discord I asked him about the maximum potential speed of 
the PicoWyfy when writing this article, he had this to say:

"I think it should be higher than for A314-cp. I saw this tweet where a guy 
saw speeds over 1.1 MB/s for picowyfy: 
https://x.com/AmigaWorld/status/1764250418731692320

But I guess it depends a lot on which Amiga it runs in. I haven't seen 
anywhere near those speeds on my Amiga. I get around 3 Mbit/s download 
speed.

Another thing I would say is that I think A314 and PicoWyfy are very 
different things. PicoWyfy a wireless network interface, that's it, while 
A314 gives many different services, shared file system, the pi terminal 
integration.

To me, the actual speed numbers don't matter that much. As long as it is 
convenient to copy files from aminet (for example) then that's enough for 
me. The convenience of having an internal wifi network interface is more 
important than having the fastest possible connection (for me, YMMV of 
course)."

@{b}Review@{ub}

BassMX is a board created by Edwin van den Oosterkamp, well-known for his Amiga
books *Classic Amiga OS Programming - An Introduction* and *Bare Metal Amiga
Programming*.

The Amiga's audio has always inspired mixed opinions. In 1985 Paula's sound
capabilities were groundbreaking, but by the late 80s and early 90s users
began to feel the limitations: hard-panned stereo and only four audio channels.
Yet with time, Paula has gone from being criticised to being celebrated. Its
constraints now feel more like character, something that pushes creativity
instead of restricting it.

Still, there's one issue almost everyone agrees on: the Amiga's extreme stereo
separation. The usual workaround is using a single audio cable for a mono
output, but this sacrifices the stereo field entirely.

Over the years I've tried all kinds of solutions: standalone amps, mixers, audio
boosters, and sometimes just embracing the mono output. They all worked in
their own way, but none felt quite right. Then, during one of my routine Amiga
patrols, I discovered the BassMX.

What makes the BassMX interesting is that it doesn't simply merge both channels
into mono. Instead, it filters the bass from each channel and mixes it into the
opposite side. This keeps the stereo image intact while providing a more
balanced, fuller sound. If you want to dive deeper into the technical side, you
can read the interview with Edwin van den Oosterkamp @{ "here." link edwinoosterkampinterview }

If you're interested in buying one, you can find it on eBay or order directly
from Edwin. I contacted him directly because eBay wasn't shipping to Japan at
the time. The total cost was just over 26 GBP including postage. Edwin shipped
it promptly with tracking, and a little over a week later a small parcel arrived
with the BassMX logo on top.

                @{ "BassMX Image 1" link Images/BassMX_1big.iff/MAIN }
                @{IMG "Images/BassMX_1small.iff"}

                @{ "BassMX Image 2" link Images/BassMX_2big.iff/MAIN }
                @{IMG "Images/BassMX_2small.iff"}

The board itself comes as an open PCB with rubber feet to keep it from sliding
around. Each end features a pair of RCA sockets, and one side includes a
mini-USB port for power. A USB-to-mini-USB cable is included. Labels clearly
mark the input and output, but there's no LED or indicator to show when the
device is powered. It's a compact board, and I found it fits neatly on the
vented section of my A1200, staying put thanks to the rubber feet.

                @{ "BassMX Image 3" link Images/BassMX_3big.iff/MAIN }
                @{IMG "Images/BassMX_3small.iff"}

@{b}Sound is everything@{ub}

So, how does it actually sound? My setup uses inexpensive Funology speakers,
which, despite their size, offer a warm tone and surprisingly punchy bass. With
the BassMX connected, the improvement was immediate. Because it spreads bass
across both channels rather than collapsing everything into mono, the sound
becomes noticeably fuller while still keeping a genuine stereo image.

Even with my modest speakers, the Amiga's audio gained presence, warmth, and a
more coherent low end. Some users may prefer the simplicity of true mono,
easily achieved with a Y-adapter, but in doing so they would miss the nuance and
character the BassMX preserves. I honestly didn't realise what my setup was
missing until I heard the BassMX in action.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

If you want to retain the original character of the Amiga's audio while giving
it a more balanced, modern feel, the BassMX is a brilliant little upgrade. It's
affordable, simple to set up, and offers a genuine improvement to the overall
listening experience. Highly recommended for anyone who cares about getting the
best sound from their Amiga.

@{b}Review@{ub}

I confess to being a bit of a book worm, each time I travel to work I have
two books in my bag along with a newspaper. Looking down at my smartphone
watching videos or scrolling through endless boring content is not my idea
of fun. But word searches are fun, at least for boring old me, and I enjoy
taking my time in the newspaper to the crossword puzzles. After I had
reviewed YEET in the last issue Zooperdan came out with another game, Wordz
which we could not fit into the October issue.

So, what is Wordz? As you can already guess by the intro and game title it
is a word search game. Usually I world not include a review of such a game
but this one has been dragging me back to Amiga, again and again. The game
is available from Zooperdan's itch.io page and is a name your own price 
game.

The game is small, simple and efficient. When you load up the game, you are
presented with a simple but effective title screen and no music. There is
an option to enter a code to jump stages. Starting from the first stage you
have a list of words on the left and a grid of letters on the right.

I confess being confussed for a while when searching for words, I was looking
and could not find anything. But, then I found out what I was doing wrong. In
the typical word search you have words going down, and left to right or 
diagonal. Wordz throws this out the window, requiring you to go left, up, 
right, down, down, left, and up. Essentially throw out the window what you 
think you know of traditional word searches and then the game starts to make
sense. When I realised I should not being thinking of Wordz as a traditional
word search game it became much easier to find words and turned into a very
enjoyable game. As far I know there was no background music but then again
I made this mistake with YEEP, I blame the years of going to raves and DJing
which gave me hearing loss. Dan kindly pointed out in an email exchange about
the music albeit it at a low volume. Maybe we need an ex-ravers music mode
for those of us with hearing loss. Sorry for that rather odd aside, back to
the game. Anyway, I decided to turn up the volume until I could hear the 
buzzing static of the Amiga audio, so yep, this time no BGM audio.

There are some nice audio touches such as sound effects when you find a word
and then move onto the next stage. I appreciate this as when I read I rather
not listen to music, I know for some it helps them read but for me I prefer
the quiet or rather constant whistling in my ears.

Letter selection is done via the mouse and left clicking and holding while
you drag out the selection of letters. That is all that is needed, the game
is entirely mouse controlled.

And that is pretty much it, it can be frustrating at first if you think of
the game as a typical word search but once you understand the game play
mechanics it becomes a great game to play. I even use this for my students
and they enjoy it a lot. Funnily enough  they figured out how to play the
game much faster than I did, I guess they are not so set in their ways yet.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

A fun little game that taxes your brain and hopefully teaches you some new
vocabulary along the way. It is a good idea to have a dictionary with you
as you might want to look up some of the words. Another little gem from
Zooperdan. Also please checkout our @{"interview" link zooperdaninterview} with him in this issue.

@{b}Review@{ub}

Originally I was not planning to review this game in the December issue as 
we already have a review of Wordz but after playing this game I had to 
include it in this issue. BLOK came out in early November of this year
and is a puzzle game where you roll a blue block through 24 levels of
increasing difficulty.

The game is available from Zooperdan's Itch.io page and is a small download
of around 400Kb, I downloaded it on my Mac and it was easy to email it to
my Amiga.

The game can be started from Workbench, and when you first start the game
you are presented with a title screen with the following options: New Game,
Enter Code, View Credits, How to Play, Quit Game. The screen has a nicely
done 3D render of the block and gameplay area.

Selecting New Game will take you to the first stage, everything is 
presented in isometric 3D. You can control your block by the arrow keys or 
a joystick.

The Enter key is used to select an option, during the game if you press the
Enter key it will bring options to continue, reset and quit the back to the
main menu, where you can go back to Workbench.

I was very surprised when I first started to play the game as the block
is unlike anything  I have seen on the Amiga before. In BLOK Dan has 
rendered the block animation in 3D and then taken those frames to make a 
very modern looking game that would not look out of place on a smart phone.

Once I got over the amazement of the block animation the game took over and 
in typical Zooperdan style this game is easy to pick up but hard to master.
Rolling the block becomes natural in no time and the first few stages are 
easy to figure out. But that is short lived as the levels quickly get 
harder. Initially figuring out the correct orientation of the block is
required but after a few levels you come across other obstacles such as
buttons, timers, crumbing floors, bridges and grating which you should not
stand on. Finally there are the lava sections which you can only roll over
once. 

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

Once again Zooperdan has created a fun and unique game, it amazing with YEET
onlu just recently released and he comes out with BLOK. And despite that this
is an incredibly fun game, the graphics are very nicely done and I still 
admire the 3D block animation after having played several times. The gameplay
is simple but addictive, perfect for a puzzle game. Once again you deserve it
to yourself to download BLOK and remember to donate to Dan for all his hard 
work, even just a few pounds goes a long way.

@{b}Review@{ub}

Chaotic Crazy Castle is a game that was programmed in just two weeks on an
A500 in AMOS. The developer Alberto Sgaggero says this shows, but does it?

Find out below.

The premise of the game is that you play a rather short mage who is on a
quest to obtain herbs that he can use in a potion to make himself taller.
Game play is spread over the several castle rooms and involve jumping onto 
ledges, avoiding enemies and collecting herbs. There is no way to kill
and enemy so you need to plan your movements ahead of time and learn the
patterns like true oldschool games. Movement is by the joystick or keyboard
with the fire button/space bar used for jumping.

On first loading the game you are presented with a Winners Don't Take Drugs
inspired screen from the days of arcades. This version has a boing ball in
the middle with the FBI replaced with the Retro Bureau of Nostalgia.
Beneath it you have the ever famous "Begone drugs, you shall not pass!"
by Ghandalf the White. Press the space bar or fire button and you are taken
the main title screen that looks very reminicent of the Castlevania title
screens. The graphics look good and come with BGM. Before starting the
game you have several options:

	* Start
	* Music on/off
	* Sound on/off
	* Lives 5
	* Fast  off/on

You can set lives up to a maximum of 9 and unlimited after that, fast on
will speed up the gameplay. I found it difficult to go back to the standard
speed after playing Fast mode.

There are various tiles around the levels that will be required to access 
certain herbs or rooms and they are as follows:

*Wood tile* 		
You can jump through it from the bottom to top, but not vice versa.
*Stone tile* 	
You can walk over it, but you can´t jump through it from below.
*Stair tile* 		
Like an escalator, when your is over this tile, you will automatically be 
taken up.
*R/L green warp tiles*
They will automatically push you forward, you cannot walk back, unless you 
jump.
*Down green warp tile*
This will automatically take you down.
*Centered green warp tile*
These tiles will slow down your left-right movements.
*Spring tile*
As you would expect, this gives you more height when jumping.
*Exclamation tile*
Instant death!

By default you start the game with 5 lives and 0 of 33 items/herbs to be 
collected. The only actions you have are moving left to right and jumping
if you jump on an enemy you die, so you need to be careful and time all
your jumps perfectly to clear the enemies and then run. Each of the enemies
have a set pattern so it pays to bide your time and memorise the pattern
as it is very easy to die in the game. If you die you are dropped back into
the game play area and this is where the game has some issues. On one stage
I died and was stuck in a loop where my character would fall at the same 
time as a passing enemy causing me to die again and again until I quit and
restart the game. This happened several times and it is possible to get out
of some of those situations by pressing left or right to alter your fall but
if you are falling directly on an enemy it is too easy to get stuck in a 
death loop like I did. Saying that, I am not that good of a gamer and it 
could just be that I am really bad at this game and others will not have the
same issue.

Aside from that small niggle the game is a lot of fun, the graphics are cute
and colourful. They remind me of some of the PC Engine games I used to play.
The various enemies while deadly are also charming, and lok very similar to 
classic Japanese console games. Each of the enemies have small animations 
which is a welcome touch. In fact there is a fun tribute to Monty Python
when you lose your final life and a giant foot comes down from the sky to
crush you.

You get some nice music while you play and sound effects, overall it is a 
very well presented game.

It can be a tough game if you are used to simply jumping on the heads of
enemies, but once you understand how to play the game it becomes very 
enjoyable. Moving between the rooms and figuring out where they connect to
get to otherwise inaccesible areas is great fun. It is not a fast game but
one that you need to think ahead to not get stuck in the future. I should
mention that there is no save feature but due to the size of the game this
should not be an issue. 

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

Chaotic Crazy Castle is fun, challenging and cute game that has a great
presentation and will keep you coming back for more. I am very much looking
forward to the second game if Alberto makes one as this game is a lot fun
and made me want more. The lovely graphics and small things like the Monty
Python tribute make it the perfect game to play this winter season. 

@{b}Pros and Cons:@{ub}
+ Tough but fun game
+ Good graphics and sound
+ Reminds me of games on the PC Engine
- I wish it could be longer
- Can be frustrating when getting into a death loop

Gameplay: 7.5/10
Graphics: 8/10
Sound:    7.5/10

@{b}Making smooth loops@{ub} - by: @{"Roald Strauss" link roaldstrauss}
=============================================================================

Making MOD music is about working with limitations. We only have 4 channels
of 8-bit resolution available. And if we want to make our MODs attractive to
Amiga game-developers, we have to produce MODs that are very small in
filesize. Because game-developers targeting a stock Amiga 500 will typically
want MODs that are only between 20 kB and 80 kB in filesize, while
game-developers targeting a stock Amiga 1200 typically lets you get away
with MODs between 150 kB and 250 kB.

There are really only 3 effective ways we can produce such a small filesize:
- Minimise the number of patterns
- Use low samplerates
- Use instruments with a short length

Minimising the number of patterns in your MOD is a matter of reusing
patterns on the expense of variation in the track. Sometimes it also helps
to use a clever mix of Fxx tempo/speed commands and E6x pattern loop
commands. Each pattern takes up 1024 bytes.
Turning the samplerate down is a simple matter of resampling the
instruments, and maybe add a bit of treble boost to bring back some of the
higher frequencies that were lost in the process. (Keep a version of the MOD
with higher samplerates though - other platforms don't have the same
limitations, and it's always good to be able to offer different versions of
your track).
And in order to minimise the length of our instruments, we can use loop
points, on the expense of variation in the sound.

Creating loops in our instruments is somewhat of a mission of its own. Who
doesn't remember spending hours in the good old days trying to find an
optimal pair of loop points in a string chord, only to give up in the end
and settle for the very noticeable hick-up when the sample looped? As if
there was a scratch in the vinyl record.
Some of us might actually still use that approach, and sometimes it'll be ok
too. As long as the mix with other instruments blurs out the hick-up, then
it'll be fine. But that's not always the case.

What only few of us knew back then, most of us have since come to know as
general knowledge: There are ways to create smooth loops without hick-ups.

In this tutorial we'll go through 3 different methods of achieving such a
smooth loop. Two that you definitely already know about now, and one that
you probably didn't know about:
- Single cycle loop
- Crossfade loop
- Monotonic chord loop

@{b}Single cycle loop@{ub}
When the focus is on producing a small filesize, it doesn't get more
effective than the single cycle loop. This method is used extensively in
chip tunes, which are typically tiny in filesize exactly because many of the
instruments consists only of such single cycle loops.
This is where you loop a single wave-length (or two) in the waveform
somewhere. Or the whole sample could consist of nothing but such a single
wave-length loop, thus resulting in a very small filesize - usually less
than 100 frames!

Single cycle loops will always give a monotonic "lifeless" sound, so you
will have to add some life (intonation) to the instrument yourself, using
commands like 4xy vibrate and/or 7xy tremolo. But the biggest problem with
single cycle looped instruments, is one that is often overlooked: Tuning.
In order to create a single cycle loop in tune (and with a clean sound as
well) with the first part of the instrument, the wave-length has to be an
integer number.

Let's say we want to loop a C, meaning a 261,63 Hz tone (when using a 440 Hz
scale). And let's say the samplerate for this tone is 16574 Hz. This will
give us a wave-length of 16574 / 261,63 = 63,35 frames, which means that we
need a single cycle loop of 63,35 frames in order to create a clean loop in
tune with the first part of the sample.
We can't do that though, because loop points has to be integer numbers. So
the first thought you might get, will be to just round it down to 63. And
that would be ok if we were creating an XM or S3M or IT. But loop points in
a MOD must be a multiple of 2. So we have to round it up to 64 frames
instead.
Rounding the loop size up to 64 frames will give us a tone of 16574 / 64 =
258,97 Hz instead of 261,63 Hz. This means the tone will "bend down" a
little when it reaches our single cycle loop, and it might also produce a
bit of alias noise, because the loop size doesn't match the actual
wave-length of the tone frequency. And that's how you may end up with a
track where multiple instruments sound completely out of tune with each
other.

How to fix this?

Well it's quite simple really. You just have to make sure that the
samplerate is an integer multiple of the tone frequency.
For a tone frequency of 261,63 Hz, the "correct" samplerate to use could be
261,63 * 64 = 16744,32 Hz. That'll give you have a nice clean sound in tune
with the tone, using a loop of as close to 64 frames you can get with a
261,63 Hz tone.
Any integer multiple of the tone-frequency will give you a single cycle
length of that factor. A samplerate of 261,63 * 30 will give you a
wave-length of about 30 frames. So it really is that simple.
For an absolute perfect single cycle loop, where the wave-length is an exact
integer, you should use integer tone frequencies as well. Instead of a C, go
for the A at 220 Hz at a samplerate of 220*64 = 14080 Hz.

This of course means you'll have to resample @{b} all@{ub} of your other instruments
as well, in order for them to be in tune with each other. And you'll also
have to accept that the tones played in the MOD won't match the tones of the
source of the instruments. But it'll totally be worth it when listening to
the end result.

As a side note: Although any integer multiple of the tone-frequency will
work, there are two advantages in always using a factor of 2 to the power of
@{b} @{i} n@{ui}@{ub} (where @{b} @{i} n@{ui}@{ub} can be any integer as long as the result is within the range
of supported samplerates). In other words; aim for a factor of 16, 32, 64,
128 etc. Because then it also becomes much easier to
- have the 9xx offset command always start at a zero-amplitude spot, to
minimise click'n'pops, and
- handle harmonic overtones: They will always be exactly @{b} @{i} n-1@{ui}@{ub} octaves
higher than the tone, meaning they will be in tune with each other
- convert your track to the Super Nintendo (because the SPC700 soundchip in
the SNES require loop points to be a multiple of 16, due to its BRR sample
format)

@{b}Crossfade loop@{ub}
As mentioned, a single cycle loop results in a somewhat lifeless monotonic
sound. If we want more dynamic intonation in the sound than what we can
produce with effect commands, then we need to loop more than a single cycle
of audio. Just like we did with the old "scratch in the vinyl record"
method. Except we'd like to avoid the scratch part.

Most of us had no clue back in the old days, but nowadays we know about this
technique for creating a smooth loop without any such hick-ups: Crossfading.

If we record a 2-second long string chord, we can then
- cut it into two halves, each 1 second long
- fade in the first part
- fade out the second part
- mix those two together

That's how you create a 1-second long crossfaded loop. It should sound
smooth without any hick-up.

But as we all know, nothing is ever that simple. There are of course other
things we need to be aware of when making a crossfaded loop: Phases.
If you simply split a random length of audio recording into two parts, the
chance of the phases matching each other is slim to none.
And while this may sometimes create an awesome phaser effect that you might
quickly decide to stick with, you will simply get a completely @{b} different@{ub}
phaser effect for the next crossfaded loop. So you'll end up with string
chords that each has a very different sound to them. Not optimal.

To create an optimal crossfaded loop, you first have to locate a natural
loop in the sound. Simply listen to the audio until you detect something
that sounds somewhat like a loop. That's how long your crossfaded loop is
going to be as well.
Then zoom into the waveform and find the two spots where the frames looks
somewhat similar. Just like you would when creating a "vinyl scratch loop".
Then cut such two natural sounding loops next to each other, and make sure
they are in phase. The beginning of both of them should look somewhat the
same. Not necessarily 100% identical, but somewhat similar.
Fade in the first part, and fade out the second part. Then mix together.
That should give you a perfect crossfaded loop without any hick-ups and
without any unwanted phase effect.
Use that approach for all your crossfaded chord strings, and it should give
you chord strings with the same sound.

@{b}Monotonic chord loop@{ub}
While the crossfade technique will indeed give you a loop without any
hick-ups, you will still be able to hear that it's a loop, because it
repeats the same sound pattern over and over again. This is unavoidable with
loops that contain changes in pitch and volume. You can make it less
noticeable of course, by making the loop longer. But we'll need a loop of
several seconds for that to work, and that will be on the expense of
filesize.

What if we want a chord that we literally can't hear is looping, while also
keeping filesize down to a minimum? Can we do that?
Absolutely! We simply need to go back to the monotonic sound again; a chord
that sounds like 3 single-cycle tones. And combine such 3 monotonic
waveforms with something called "just intonation".

Let's try it out by creating a D major chord at a samplerate of 14080 Hz.

A D major chord consist of the 3 tones D, F# and A. The D is at 587,33 Hz,
and at a samplerate of 14080 Hz, that gives a wave-length of 23,97 frames.
The F# is at 739,99 Hz, giving a wave-length of 19,03 frames. And the A is
at 880 Hz, giving a wave-length of 16 frames.

As we learned with the single cycle loop, the goal is to use a combination
of tone frequency and samplerate that'll give us a wave-length that is an
integer number. This is easy to achieve for single tones, but impossible to
do for all 3 tones in a chord - unless we cheat a little bit...
If we round 23,97 up to 24, and 19,03 down to 19, then we'll have 3
wave-lengths that is each an integer number.
Then consequence is that the D and F# will be slightly out of tune. The D
will now land at 586,67 Hz instead of 587,33 Hz, which means it'll be off by
0,11%. And the F# will land at 741,05 Hz instead of 739,99 Hz, which means
it'll be off by 0,14%. In both cases that's such a small deviation that it
doesn't matter, because it won't be noticeable.

So now we have 3 integer wave-lengths of 16, 19 and 24. And this means we're
now using "just intonation" tuning.
All we have to do now, is to find the first integer number that - when
divided with each of the 3 wave-lengths - results in an integer number for
all three. I wrote a small little tool that simply counts an integer
variable up until it finds that number. And that number tells you what the
size of the loop will be. In this case: @{b} 912@{ub}!

Yes, you read that right. And I bet you probably won't believe it till you
hear it. But it's true: You can actually make a chord, that you can't hear
is a chord (because it uses "just intonation" tuning), using only 912
frames. Because:
912 frames / 16 frames per cycle = 57 cycles
912 frames / 19 frames per cycle = 48 cycles
912 frames / 24 frames per cycle = 38 cycles
At 912 frames each tone will have completed an integer number of cycles.

Ok, so how to do this?
Well there are several ways, but let's use Milkytracker as our tool: You can
use the Generator in the Sample Editor. Create a new instrument containing
14080 frames. Then generate a tone of 586,67 Hz at 30% volume. Use any kind
of waveform you want; Sine, Triangle, Square or Sawtooth. Add another tone
of 741,05 Hz at 30% volume again. And lastly a tone of 880 Hz again at 30%.
Then set loop start to 0 and loop end to 912, and listen to the wonder that
is a short monotonic loop without hick-ups and without being able to hear
that it is a loop - in only 912 frames.

You can play around with different samplerates and tone frequencies. Certain
tones will deviate too much at certain samplerates. So the goal is to find
the optimal frequencies for both the tones and samplerate, while at the same
time having all the other instruments in the track stay in tune.

@{b}DigiPaint Basics: TxMap Fun@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

@{b}Introduction@{ub}

In the last two issues we have been exploring what you can do with DigiPaint
and in this third part of the series we will delve into the newest feature
in version 3 of DigiPaint, TxMap.

TxMap essentially allows you to warp/resize any custom brush and fit it into
any shape you make. This even includes text.

For TxMap to work you first need to create a custom brush, in my example I
created a simple checkerboard using the 'Range' mode that we covered in the
previous guides. Once you have your custom brush ready, you need to cut it
out and then put it into the buffer, this can be accomplished from the menu
by going to 'Brush -> Swap -> Copy Brush'. When you do this the TxMap menu
will become unghosted and available.

Now starts the TxMap fun!

There are many options that can be used with TxMap and they are all 
controlled from the Warping controls setting area. To get there, make sure
that TxMap is selected in the menubar, 'Mode -> TxMap', then click on the
'Controls' button on the bottom left. Here you will see several options
just like before, the first one we will look at is the 'Tiles' one. As it
sounds, this sets how many times your custom brush will be copied and only
works in TxMap mode. The maximum number is 9 copies, horizontally or 
vertically.

Next we have the Warp controls, it can be easily identified by the wireframe
sphere with three buttons on the left that start at the top with a curved
arc, a lesser curved arc and a vertical line. As before you can either click
on the buttons or use the slider next to it. They control how much warping
will applied, with the most severe at the top to none at the bottom.

Above the sphere and to the right of the slider are three more buttons, they
are not exactly clear what they do, so from the left side:

Point warping, Horizontal warping and Vertical warping.

As you click on each button you will see a white square appear for the Point
warping, a horizontal line and a vertical line, very logical, right?

Let's have a new perspective

So, now let's give it a try. For example you want to create a perspective 
floor, what would you need to do? Presuming for the moment that you have
created your floor texture and cut a brush, put it into the buffer and have
now activated TxMap, you need to choose the right tool. In this regard you
will need the 'Polygon/Straight' tool, and remember to have the 'FILL' 
button selected. For the most effective perspective texture map, you should
select the 'Horizontal' warping button, i.e. the middle one above the 
sphere. When you have drawn out your shape, remember to click the right
mouse button to start the fill/texturemap. If you forgot to increase the 
'Tiles' settings you will only get one instance of your brush, so remember
to push it all the way up to 9 for the best effect. This is also a good
place to mention the 'Smoothing' button. By default this is turned off but
for better results I recommend turning it on particularly when you are using
TxMap mode. 

Below is an image of some of the warping effects that can be accomplished 
with a simple checkerboard brush and playing around with the warp settings 
and using the correct drawing tool.

                @{"DigiPaint Example" link Images/DigiPaint3.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/DigiPaint3.iff"}
I hope you have been enjoying this DigiPaint series and found some parts
of use. Until our next meeting in cyberspace, I wish you the warmest seasons
greetings!

@{b}Better Audio Sampling@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

@{b}Introduction@{ub}
Sampling into the Amiga can be a challenging task at times, trying to get a
loud enough source to reduce unwanted noise and getting the right sampling
rate. More so, depending on the type of instrument/sound you are sampling 
the particular sampling rate matters. Not all of us are technically minded
to fully understand the various technical techniques needed. So, this is a
simplfied guide on how to best to sample audio into your Amiga.

When creating your music you need to be aware of how much memory your 
samples will take up, something that does not need to be considered when 
working with modern computers and software.

However there is a good guide of what rates are best when sampling and they
are listed below. To begin with we will work with musical note, if you are
not a musical person, a good way to do it is by using Renoise for example
and a VST. When you input a note on the edit window it will show the note
vaue and you can then sample this straight into the Amiga with the correct
sample rate.

For more indepth ways on how to get better sample quality please refer to
Roald Strauss's audio series from previous issues and this one. However, I
recommend printing out this guide and have it ready whenever you sample as
a quick overview for what sampling rates you should be aiming for. And 
remeber to always try and sample as loud as you can to get the most from

=============================================================================
@{b}How to Backup Your Amiga CF Disk Drive on a Mac@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

This guide demonstrates how to create a backup image of your Amiga CF disk 
on a Mac using the Terminal application.

   Requirements:
   - Mac running macOS
   - Amiga CF disk inserted into a USB card reader
   - Basic knowledge of Terminal commands

@{b}Step 1: Identify the CF Disk@{ub}
-----------------------------
   1. Insert your Amiga CF disk into the USB card reader and connect it to 
      your Mac.
   2. Open the Terminal application (Applications > Utilities > Terminal).
   3. List all connected disks by entering the following command:
      diskutil list
   4. Identify your CF disk in the list. It will typically be named 
      something like "/dev/disk2" or similar. Note this identifier.

@{b}Step 2: Unmount the CF Disk@{ub}
---------------------------
   1. Before creating a backup, unmount the CF disk to ensure data 
      integrity.
   2. Replace "disk2" with your actual disk identifier:
      diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2

@{b}Step 3: Create the Backup Image@{ub}
-------------------------------
   1. Use the `dd` command to create a raw image of the CF disk. Replace 
      "disk2" with your disk identifier and specify the desired output file 
      path:
      
      sudo dd if=/dev/rdisk2 of=~/Desktop/amiga_backup.img bs=1m
   2. Enter your administrator password when prompted.
   3. Wait for the process to complete. The time required will depend on 
      the size of your CF disk.

@{b}Step 4: Compress the Backup Image (Optional)@{ub}
--------------------------------------------
   1. To save space, you can compress the backup image using gzip:
      gzip ~/Desktop/amiga_backup.img
   2. This will create a compressed file named "amiga_backup.img.gz" on 
      your desktop.

@{b}Step 5: Restore the Backup (if needed)@{ub}
--------------------------------------
   1. To restore the backup to a CF disk, insert the target CF disk into 
      the USB card reader.
   2. Unmount the target CF disk:
      diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2
   3. Write the backup image to the CF disk using the `dd` command:
      sudo dd if=~/Desktop/amiga_backup.img of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m
   4. Wait for the process to complete. The time required will depend on 
      the size of your CF disk.

Alternative CF restore

If you do not want to mess around with the Mac OS terminal anymore then 
balendaEtcher will work fine. Unfortunately there is no GUI based software
to back up your CF card on the Mac yet.

@{b}Important Notes:@{ub}
----------------
   - Be cautious when using the `dd` command. Specifying the wrong disk 
     identifier can result in data loss.
   - Ensure you have selected the correct input and output devices before 
     proceeding.
   - As always, it's recommended to back up your data regularly to prevent 
     data loss.

For more information on using the `dd` command and disk management on macOS,

@{b}Keep the Amiga alive@{ub} - by: @{"Roald Strauss" link roaldstrauss}
=============================================================================

Imagine having the power to keep the Amiga alive forever. Or at least for 
the rest of your life. For as long as you can enjoy it. Imagine having that 
power for any other platform as well. And any other creative field you can 
think of. In fact; anything in life you treasure. Imagine being able to keep 
all of those things alive.

Now brace yourself for an epiphany: That's not a fantasy at all! You @{b}do@{ub} 
have the power to keep the Amiga alive! And many other things as well!

But it's highly probable that no one ever told you how to use that power of 
yours. So I'm going to tell you now.

Let's start by listing a few examples of things we would like to be able to 
keep doing:

- Watch new cool Amiga demos
- Play new Amiga games
- Listen to new Amiga Protracker or OctaMED music
- Read articles in new issues of WhatIFF? Magazine
- Buy new Amiga hardware

All of those examples have one main thing in common: They're all products 
made by someone. Sometimes a single person. Other times a group of people. 
The reason cool Amiga demos exists, is because someone made them. Same with 
all the other examples.

So let's say you've discovered a composer that makes MODs you really enjoy 
listening to. Or a writer who writes articles you really enjoy reading. Or 
a game-developer who makes games that really entertain you. How do you then 
use this awesome power or yours to make sure these people will continue 
making all these things for you?

It's ridiculously simple. I'll tell you know:

@{b}You simply tell the authors that their work is awesome and appreciated.@{ub}

That's how simple it is: You make all of these creative people stay 
passionate, by telling them their work is awesome and appreciated. So 
whenever you stumble across something that adds value to your life, you 
should reach out to the authors and let them know how much you appreciate 
their efforts. Don't be shy. It's as simple as writing an e-mail.

Of course, if you @{b}really@{ub} wanna make an impact, then you go ahead and buy 
whatever creation the authors have made. Buy their games! (Even if it's not 
your favourite genre - just buy it to keep the developer interested in the 
platform).

If you @{b}don't@{ub} send your positive feedback, to let them know about 
your sincere appreciation, there's a big chance they will eventually stop 
creating more awesome demos / games / music / articles etc in the future - 
all because you didn't think about utilising your awesome power.

You see, there's another power that everyone has, that they sadly use 
@{b}all the time@{ub} for some reason: We're experts in @{b}complaining@{ub} about 
everything that doesn't go the way we want. Even before watching / playing / 
listening / reading etc, a lot of people are ridiculously quick to dismiss 
something - and post negatively about it on a random forum.

This means, that when you @{b}don't@{ub} post your @{b}positive@{ub} feedback with 
your sincere appreciation, then the majority of the feedback the creator(s) 
are getting, is negative. Because complainers are always quick to post. 
Self-entitled people complaining about every little thing that wasn't made 
the way they want it. Oh yes, the world is full of them.

And that means it's all up to you! Go forth into the world now, and utilise 
your awesome powers to keep all good things alive. We depend upon you!

@{b}Looking Back at 2025: The Amiga Moves Forward@{ub} - by: @{"ByteBandit" link bytebandit}
============================================================================

2025 proved that the Amiga is not just a memory piece, but a living
platform. New hardware, game releases, brand revivals, and community
movements show the spirit still thrives. From indie platformers to
officially licensed classics and even fresh life for the Commodore
name this has been one of the most eventful years in recent memory.

@{b}40th Anniversary@{ub}

2025 marked forty years since the first public unveiling of the Amiga 1000
in 1985. Exhibitions across the world highlighted early models including
the A1000, A500, and A1200. Classic machines were brought out of
storage, fans revisited old demos and games; a tribute to how radical
the Amiga once was in terms of graphics, sound, and multitasking.

Though decades have passed, the enthusiasm surrounding these celebrations
showed that the Amiga remains a machine with a beating heart.

@{b}New Hardware in 2025@{ub}

Two major hardware stories drew attention this year.

== THEA1200 / Full-Size A1200 Replica ==
A full-sized A1200 recreation often referred to as THEA1200 was
shown at Gamescom 2025, offering a working keyboard and aiming to bring
back classic A1200-style Amiga into a modern *retro-futurist-form*.
This move resonates for those who seek the classic form factor but with
some modern convenience.

Pre-orders opened in November with a planned shipping window of mid-2026.

== FPGA Based Next Gen: Apollo A6000 ==
Meanwhile, the FPGA powered Apollo Computing pushed forward with the debut
of the Apollo A6000, a modern Amiga-compatible machine built around the
AC68080 core, combining classic 68K compatibility with updated hardware
(HDMI, modern RAM, storage, etc.).

For many in the community, the A6000 stands as proof that Amiga can
evolve and not just be preserved.

@{b}New Games & Software@{ub}

2025 saw a surprisingly healthy flow of new and revived games for the
Amiga.

- **The Settlers II: Gold Edition** after nearly 30 years since the
  original release, a fully licensed, optimized Amiga port of the iconic
  RTS arrived on October 18, 2025. The release offered three editions:
  Digital, Box, and a limited Collector's Edition: giving both casual
  players and collectors something to enjoy.

- Homebrew & indie scene remained vibrant: titles like **Phantom Leap**
  by HooGames2017, and **Master of Minefields** from Digital Worlds Studio
  surfaced this year. Such releases show that for those willing to
  tinker and code, the Amiga remains a platform for creative expression not 
  just nostalgia.

- On the software side, AmigaOS 3.2.3 launched in 2025, bringing over
  50 fixes and improvements, and enhancing compatibility - including
  support for modern accelerator setups like PiStorm-style expansions.
  These updates prove that classic 68K Amigas can still stay relevant even 
  in 2025.

@{b}Commodore Revival@{ub}

One of the most headline-grabbing stories of 2025 was the revival of
the brand behind the Amiga's origin: the Commodore name. In mid-2025 a
fan-led consortium officially acquired all 47 original Commodore
trademarks, forming a new entity to steer the brand onward.

While that acquisition doesn't automatically give them control over AmigaOS
or existing IP like ROMs, which remain under different stewardship, it opens 
the door to a broader *retro-futurist* vision.

The revived Commodore already reissued an FPGA-based recreation of the
classic 8-bit home computer (the Ultimate C64), and signaled interest
in expanding into broader retro-computing hardware, a move that has
reignited hope among some Amiga fans that future hardware or licensed
products might emerge under the Commodore banner.

@{b}Community & Obituaries@{ub}

2025 was not without its shadows. The Amiga/Commodore community lost a
longtime veteran:

- **Gail Wellington** (b. 1940 d. 2025), known as a former Commodore-UK
  staffer and influential in software/product support for the Amiga
  (and related platforms), passed away earlier this year. She was once
  described as mother of CDTV, and her contributions to the Commodore
  software side helped shape the user experience for many during the
  platform's early days.

Her death was met with sorrow across retro-computing circles, reminding
us that many of the pioneers who made the Amiga possible are now aging
but their legacy endures in the hardware, software, and community
spirit still alive today.

@{b}Closing Thoughts@{ub}

Looking back at 2025, the Amiga stands at an unexpected crossroads. On
one hand, retro-accurate recreations and new indie games offer nostalgia
and preservation. On the other, FPGA-powered next-gen hardware, OS
updates, and a revived Commodore brand suggest potential for growth and
reinvention.

For veterans, 2025 is a warm reminder: the glow of the Workbench screen
is still bright. For newcomers, it's an invitation: whether you pick up
a boxed game, dust off an old A1200, or join the next wave of Amiga-
inspired projects, there is an Amiga waiting for you.

*ByteBandit tip:* Honor the old but be ready for something new. The
Amiga spirit lives in what we build next, not only in what we preserved.

@node sceneornot "To be or not to be a scener"
@toc articles
============================================================================
@{b}To be or not to be a scener@{ub} - by: @{"Roald Strauss" link roaldstrauss}
=============================================================================

To be or not to be a scener. Is that the question?

I still remember discovering The Scene in the early 90s, and the
feeling of finally having found the group of people I belonged with:
The ones that were just as geeky and passionate and weird about
computer creativity as I was. I'd been scouting for people like that
for a long time. Someone I could better relate to. Someone I could
share my hobby with. Someone I could spar with, exchange
tips'n'tricks with, so that we could both learn more about our shared
interest. Such like-minded people had previously seemed impossible for
me to find anywhere. They were definitely non-existent in primary
school.

But primary school never managed to impress me in any other aspect
either. I remember often wondering what the point was with school. The
teachers mostly seemed tired of both their job and the pupils, and I
never saw the logic in why we needed to learn most of what was
taught. But I suspect most of us felt that way back then.
The highlight of my day was to come home from school, switch on my
Amstrad CPC464 and play around with BASIC programming. I felt I
learned @{b}much@{ub} more about coding and math and even physics, at home
in front of my Amstrad CPC, than I did in school - even though we
actually did have classes in school that were supposed to teach us
about computers and programming.

@{i}All we did in computer classes at school, was to input the data of
all the pupils of the school into a database system the teacher had
written (no GDPR whatsoever back then), presumably because he thought
it was his ticket out of teaching. He needed his database system to be
full of data in order to be able to give a proper demonstration to a
group of important men in fancy suits. But apparently he didn't manage
to impress these men, because he kept teaching.@{ui}

Going to bed at night was the low-point of the day, because it meant
that the next activity on my "Incredibly boring things I'm forced to
do" list, when I woke up, was to go to school and waste all day there.

School was this place we were forced to go spend most of the day on
incredibly boring things we never ever had any use for later in life.
Like for example read the most boring books in the world - and then
prove that we had actually read it - or be scolded in front of the
whole class if we hadn't. I'm sure some day in the future, humanity
will look back at that era and cringe in shame of how primitive our
ways once were.

As a result, my desire to read was completely destroyed. To this day I
still haven't read a single novel since primary school, and reading in
general is something I try to avoid. I simply lost all interest in
reading, with the exception of minor academic texts, when searching
for answers about whatever technical topic I'm currently exploring.
Like for example noise reduction in 8-bit audio, or the specification
for various filetypes like MOD, or how to detect a frequency in a
sample. Stuff like that.

And it probably seems a bit ironic that I don't like reading,
considering how much I actually like to @{b}write@{ub}. Especially when
looking at the size of my @{"8-bit Memoirs" system "openurl
https://www.8bitmemoirs.com"} project, as well as the articles and
tutorials I've written for WhatIFF? Magazine so far. But no one ever
@{b}forced@{ub} me to write texts like those. That's the key. That's
how you stay passionate about something. By not being forced to do it.
All good things in life can be completely ruined by being forced to do
them.

@{b}Discovering The Scene@{ub}
When I grew older and (finally) replaced my Amstrad CPC464 with an
Amiga 600, my creative hobby doing BASIC programming was replaced with
Protracker MOD tracking. Most of my spare time was now spent making
music in Protracker. Coming home from school to my Amiga (where I was
actually learning stuff), was still the highlight of the day. I used
my music as an outlet that let me express the things I experienced in
life. I had a theory that most artists did this. And this theory was
confirmed when I began listening to MODs created by other musicians.

This was back in the day before The Internet was a common thing. The
only place I had access to The Internet, was on the Windows PC's at
school. So when I learned that my Amiga could read 720 kB PC formatted
disks, I began bringing a bunch of such disks with me to school every
day, in order to download files from Aminet and bring new interesting
software and other files with me home. I bet a lot of us did exactly
that in those days.
The school had its own little shop where students could buy
accessories like pencils, pads, calculators - and floppy disks! And I
soon became their biggest customer of floppy disks.

Bringing 10-20 disks full of Aminet content with me home every day soon
became the biggest incentive for attending school. On days where I felt
more like staying at home, it was the thought of exploring new Aminet
content that made me go anyway. The new highlight of the day was to
come home from school and check out the downloads of the day: Listen
to MODs made by other artists, watch demos and check out a few games.

It was while listening to MODs by other artists, that I realised I was
part of this global group of artists somehow. The ones who created
music simply because it was their passion - not to make money, but
simply because being creative was a fundamental part of who they were.
And for a long time, MODs became my primary source of music. Mainstream
radio didn't interest me at all, and neither did professional albums on
CD. No other music had the soul and authenticity that MODs had. MODs
were created by the @{i}real@{ui} artists, I felt. This was where the
@{b}real@{ub} quality was, created by artists I could relate with.

It was around this time I learned that there was a name for this group
of artists. This group was called "The Scene". And I remember it made
me instantly feel even @{b}more@{ub} connected to everyone. A large
group of fellow artists located all over the world. Everyone one being
creative on different computers in various fields, making their art
freely available for everyone. Artists sharing and enjoying each
other's music and graphics and coding art. It felt very altruistic to
me that everyone simply gave away their art to the world, and all they
wanted in return was to enjoy everyone else's art. So refreshing to
finally see some altruistic behaviour in this otherwise exceedingly
selfish world. There was no doubt: I definitely belonged in this group
of people.

In December 1994 me and my Amiga mates then went to The Party in
Denmark. It was here I was introduced to diskmags, when Buzz Diskmag
#5 was released. For some weird reason, I had never seen a diskmag
before. And it was a rather positive surprise for me to discover that
The Scene @{b}also@{ub} consisted of @{b}writers@{ub}.
Experiencing Buzz Diskmag #5 made me feel even @{b}more@{ub} connected
to The Scene. @{b}And for the first time in many years, I found myself
enjoying reading non-academic texts again.@{ub} That really says it
all, doesn't it? @{b}Primary school literally ruined my desire to read,
and Buzz Diskmag #5 brought it back again.@{ub}

Not to a degree that I ever started reading novels again though. I
still don't do that. There's just something very icky about a paper
book. A black Times New Roman font on a dry white background... ew...
But diskmags were something entirely different. A bright ambient
coloured font on a dark background, while cosy background music is
playing, and with little pieces of drawn art embedded in the texts.
Everything created by various artists in The Scene.

To this day I still love the concept of diskmags, and would love to
see more of them. There's just something incredibly cosy and relaxing
about a diskmag, that a website will never have.

For this reason, I spent years encouraging my fellow Amstrad CPC geeks
to create a new diskmag for the Amstrad CPC, until I finally gave up
and decided to created my 8-bit Memoirs eBook project as a
diskmag-looking creation instead.

@{b}"Demosceners compete"@{ub}
For many years I walked around with the impression that I was "a
scener", and I felt a strong coherence with all other sceners.

But then came a day where I realised something about The Scene that
made me question if I'd ever actually truly belonged. And to this day
I still have those doubts, leaning mostly towards "probably not
really".

To find out for sure, let's first be sure we have the correct
definition of what a scener is. In these modern times, when you google
for something, it's difficult to avoid getting an AI answer back.

@{i}A demoscener is a member of the demoscene, a digital subculture that
focuses on the creative use of computers to produce non-interactive
audiovisual presentations called "demos". These demos showcase creative
coding, computer graphics, and electronic music, often pushing the
limits of what's possible on a particular platform. Demosceners compete
in "compos" (competitions) at demo parties, where they share and
celebrate their art.@{ui}

And that corresponds pretty much exactly to my own perception of what a
demoscener is. But it doesn't clarify whether I'm a scener or not.

I'm definitely on board with the first part: Focuses on the creative
use of computers to produce (in my case) MOD music.
I also put all of my music online, making it free to download and
listen to for everyone.

My tracks are @{b}not@{ub} free to @{b}use@{ub} without my permission
though. For example; a game-developer isn't allowed to put my music in
his game without my permission. And I also don't upload my tracks to
any of the scene related sites (anymore). I only publish my tracks on
my own site: IndieGameMusic.com - where I'm offering freeware and
commercial licenses to game-developers for using my tracks in their
games. I'm not sure how scener'ish that is, but let's get back to
that.

I'm also on board with the "often pushing the limits of what's
possible on a particular platform" part. For me, it has always been a
fun challenge to (try to) make "MODs that doesn't sound like MODs", by
creating a sound with a quality that isn't typically heard in a MOD.
The best kind of feedback I can get is when people actually doubt that
it is in fact a MOD they're listening to.

I enjoy finding various techniques to try out. For example; ways to
reduce quantisation noise and alias noise, avoid click'n'pops,
optimise harmonic distortions, finding interesting ways to create new
sounds and various effects as well as finding interesting ways to
create smooth loops, and have the MOD use only 3 channels and 80 kb
while sounding like much more.
So far so good.

But then the definition continues with "Demosceners compete", and
that's where I'm definitely out. I don't create my music to compete
with anyone. I generally don't compete with anyone in anything. I only
ever participated in about two one-hour compo's I think, and that
wasn't really to compete, but rather because I was bored and curious
to see what such a one-hour compo was like. Frankly, I have never
liked any kind of competition in any kind of category in any aspect of
life. I don't even feel you @{b}can@{ub} compete in art. And I do very
much feel that any kind of creativity anyone is doing in The Scene, is
exactly that: Art.

So I guess it just comes down to this question: Is it a mandatory
thing to participate in the competitions, in order to be considered a
scener? Or is it an optional thing? I'm not sure.

Obviously it won't be difficult to find people in The Scene who will
say that the competitions are entirely optional. But if we take a look
at the actual activities going on in The Scene, aren't the
competitions always the main focus then? Seems to me they are. And
it's also difficult to simply exist in The Scene without being asked
why I don't participate in the competitions. So it seems to me that
the general mentality is indeed focused on the competitions.

This also became apparent to me when checking out other diskmags up
through the years, trying to find the same cosy atmosphere that I
found in Buzz Diskmag #5 back in 1994. I felt most of the newer
diskmags focused more and more on the competitive side of The Scene,
and I found myself struggling to find the cosy atmosphere in that.
I preferred all other kinds of texts: Articles where the only
scenerish thing about them was that they were written by another
scener. Random stories and/or deep philosophical thoughts and
observations from fellow sceners. Somewhat like this article here
you're reading right now.

But this category of texts seemed to vanish from diskmags in general
up through the years, and I therefor lost the interest in actual
diskmags again. But I never lost the enthusiasm for my own vision of
how such a diskmag should be. To this day I'd still like to see a
diskmag like that; where most of the content is simply sceners sharing
stories and thoughts and observations and experiences about whatever
various topics. "Sceners exploring / experiencing the world".
But I realise I'm probably the only one in the world who'd enjoy a
diskmag of that calibre.

I have to admit that the feeling of coherence with The Scene has kept
fading over the years. It's almost impossible for me to find the cosy
atmosphere I remember from the good old days, despite my efforts of
trying to bring it back, by creating my MODs and writing articles like
this one. This of course could very well also just be because I'm
getting older. Because with age comes the unavoidable realisation that
the world is a rather messed up and depressing place. And this state
of sad epiphany obviously makes it difficult to experience everything
with the same joy as we did when we were younger. But that's exactly
why I seek these cosy moments being creative with my music and my
writing. Hasn't our creativity always been our escape from this insane
world? (Or was that just me?)

I know that composing MODs has always been @{b}my@{ub} escape from the
hectic daily stressful demands. And I still do enjoy MOD composing, on
the rare occasion I succeed in making something I'm satisfied with.
And my primary goal with my music is to give other people that same
cosy feeling that other artists gave me up through the years. A
feeling of coherence, belonging, relaxation and positive vibes. A
temporary escape of their own, and/or inspiration for their own art.
That's what I've always felt The Scene was about: Giving each other
positive inspiration and entertainment in exchange for positive
inspiration and entertainment. Boost the creativity for fellow
sceners.

That's my goal when making music, when writing articles like this,
when I created IndieGameMusic.com, whenever I put my music on
IndieGameMusic.com, when I occasionally create a little retro game for
a classic platform, when I (try to) collaborate with developers on any
platform doing music experiments to learn what can and can't be done
on that particular platform - to forward this knowledge to all other
sceners interested in that platform.

To me, that way of thinking is exactly what I thought The Scene was
all about. It's definitely what I would like The Scene to be all
about. Sceners helping fellow sceners be sceners.

But that perspective may very well just be my own illusion. Because
far too often I'm met with a rather opposite attitude, which reveals
that this perspective of mine is a rather rare one. The enthusiastic
scene spirit that I expected to be met with here and there, has been
difficult to find. Sometimes it actually feels like The Scene is dying
from some kind of cancer, caused by all the non scene-spirited people
who only joined The Scene much later than the rest of us, for the sole
reason that it was now suddenly considered cool to be a scener - and
they wanted in on it.

That of course happens in any kind of community, and it's always the
main cause of fragmentation. So maybe I'm simply on a new quest these
days: Find the fragment I belong in - if such a fragment exists
anymore.

Can anyone point me in the general direction of the fragment in The
Scene consisting mainly of philosophically enthusiastic creative
non-competitive artists, whose main goal is simply to inspire each
other and share tips'n'tricks etc?

The question still remains though:
To be or not to be a scener (in that fragment)... Is that the
question?

@{b}Amiga Insight: Amiga Shops@{ub} - by: @{"ByteBandit" link bytebandit}
============================================================================

There was a time when walking into a computer shop meant a glimpse into the 
future. Rows of beige boxes hummed under fluorescent lights, demo disks 
looped colourful graphics, and salespeople with pocket protectors promised 
the dawn of a new era. And for a few golden years in the mid-to-late 1980s, 
that era was ruled by one name: Amiga.

The Amiga didn't just arrive as another home computer; it burst onto the 
scene with a promise of multimedia before multimedia was a word. But how it 
reached users hands and which shops took the risk to sell it tells a 
fascinating story about two markets with very different sales cultures: 
the United States and the United Kingdom.

@{b}The American Dream Machine@{ub}

Commodore launched the Amiga 1000 in July 1985 at a glitzy New York event 
that felt more like a movie premiere than a computer launch. Andy Warhol 
was there, famously painting Debbie Harry's portrait on an Amiga screen. It 
was clear Commodore wanted the Amiga to be seen as something more than just 
another beige box of microchips.

In the United States, the strategy was deliberate: avoid the toy aisles that 
had swallowed the Commodore 64 and move into specialist computer retailers 
and upmarket department stores. Commodore wanted prestige.

Early on, the Amiga 1000 appeared in the same kinds of shops that carried 
Macintosh and IBM PCs. Stores like Software Etc., Electronics Boutique, and 
ComputerLand stocked them, while chains such as Montgomery Ward, Macy's, and 
VideoConcepts featured them on shiny glass counters alongside camcorders and 
VCRs. For a brief moment, the Amiga was the luxury computer you could buy 
next to a new colour TV.

Mail-order operations soon caught on too. One of the most important was 
Creative Computers (later known as PCM, Inc.), which began selling Amiga 
systems by mail in 1987. Their thick catalogues, filled with Amiga 
accessories, RAM expansions, and graphics boards, became a lifeline for 
users far from major cities. Even US Amiga magazines initially such as 
Amazing Computing Amiga and Amiga World had pages full of advertisements 
filled with Amiga goodies from the likes of Creative Computers.

But not everything was smooth sailing. Independent dealers often distrusted 
Commodore, still smarting from the company's aggressive pricing of the 
VIC-20 and C64, which had cut into their margins. Many retailers refused to 
carry the line at all. The result was an uneven network: strong pockets of 
Amiga fandom surrounded by vast PC territory.

As the 1990s rolled in, IBM compatibles flooded the market, and the Amiga's 
U.S. presence faded fast. By the time Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, most 
of its American retail allies had already turned to DOS and Windows. The 
Amiga, once sold under bright neon banners, was now found only through 
mail-order outfits and a handful of passionate resellers who refused to let 
the dream die.

@{b}The British Invasion@{ub}

Across the Atlantic, things looked very different. In the UK, the Amiga 
didn't just sell it exploded.

Where the U.S. had tried to pitch the machine as a high-end business 
computer, Commodore UK took a different tack: make it fun. The Amiga 500 
was sold in colourful bundles with names like The Batman Pack or 
The Cartoon Classics Pack, packed with games, paint programs, and a mouse 
that kids could actually use. That strategy made the Amiga a household 
name.

The face of that success was the Silica Shop, founded in 1982 in Sidcup, 
Kent. Originally a mail-order outfit, it grew into one of Britain's best-
known Amiga retailers, with storefronts and concessions inside major 
department stores. Silica's thick, glossy catalogues became as iconic to 
Amiga fans as the hardware itself. From joysticks and memory expansions to 
entire systems, if you needed it for your Amiga, Silica probably had it.

They weren't alone. Independent retailers popped up in nearly every city: 
Special Reserve, Micro Anvika, Power Computing, RCS Management, and 
countless small high-street computer stores. Even large chains like 
Dixons and John Lewis occasionally carried the Amiga line, especially 
during the A500's heyday.

What made the UK unique was the culture around it. Every month, magazines 
like Amiga Format, CU Amiga, and The One overflowed with full-page ads from 
these shops. Some had photos of shelves stacked floor to ceiling with boxed 
copies of Deluxe Paint to Lemmings. Others offered mail-order deals with 
free joysticks and posters. Buying Amiga gear was as much a community 
experience as it was a transaction.

While the U.S. struggled to convince office managers that the Amiga belonged 
on a desk, the UK had no such doubts. For British gamers, graphic artists, 
and budding musicians, the Amiga was the desk.

@{b}Decline and Legacy@{ub}

As the 1990s rolled on, PCs and consoles began to erode the Amiga's 
dominance. Even Commodore UK, one of the company's most profitable 
subsidiaries, couldn't survive the parent company's collapse in 1994. Silica 
Shop soldiered on for a couple more years before eventually closing in 1996, 
and many of its contemporaries followed suit.

Yet, the Amiga never truly disappeared. In the early 2000s, a new wave of 
online stores emerged, catering to the retro revival. Shops like AmigaKit 
(founded in 2004), Vesalia and Alinea (founded 2005) kept the platform alive 
with hardware repairs, accelerator cards, and even new cases and keycaps. In 
some ways, these are the spiritual successors to Silica Shop and Creative 
Computers the same passion, just updated for the internet age.

@{b}The Shopfront That Time Forgot@{ub}

The history of Amiga retail isn't just about who sold the machines it's 
about how they sold them. In the U.S., the Amiga was a daring premium 
product that struggled to find its market among cautious dealers. In the UK, 
it was a populist hit, sold with charm, colour, and character through a 
network of independent retailers who treated customers like club members.

Walk down any high street in the late 80s, and you could spot the glow of 
a 1084 monitor through a shop window. Step inside, and you might have found 
a kid transfixed by the latest Amiga game or if they were lucky a demo 
dreaming of making their own game one day. Those shops weren't just sales 
floors they were 
gateways into creativity.

Today, when you order an Amiga accelerator or new mouse adapter online, 
you're continuing a tradition that started in those noisy, neon-lit stores. 
The packaging might be smaller, the delivery digital, but the spirit of 
discovery remains the same.

@{b}Living With a Spouse... and an Amiga@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

The Amiga can be a challenging hobby. Repairs, new hardware, and upgrades 
can quickly make you feel as though your beloved machine is a black hole 
quietly devouring your savings. You *could* go the emulation route, it's 
free and convenient, but where's the magic in that? 

Many of us want to *feel* the Amiga: the clack of the keys, the whirr of the 
drives, the unmistakable sounds of our youth. That physicality simply 
doesn't translate through emulation.

As technology has improved and shrunk, physical media has all but vanished.
Videotapes, DVDs, Blu-rays, cassettes, CDs, and MiniDiscs have been replaced 
by MP3s and streaming. Homes have become tidier and more minimalistic 
because our media no longer needs shelves. Owning an Amiga today is, in many 
ways, a joyful rebellion against that minimalism; a return to cables, 
clutter, and tactile nostalgia.

This brings me to my predicament: I am an Amiga user, and my wife is a
minimalist. Recently, these two worlds collided.

Life in a Danchi
================

To set the scene, I live in Japan with my Japanese wife in a *danchi*, a 
type of public housing block built between the 1950s and 1970s. According to 
Wikipedia, "Danchi is the Japanese word for a large cluster of apartment 
buildings... Older danchi are sometimes compared to Khrushchyovkas." In 
other words: compact, practical, efficient and not exactly spacious.

Small spaces require minimalism. Over the years I parted with my 12" records
from my DJ days, my old consoles, and most of my DVDs and Blu-rays. What
remains: a few discs, a Super Famicom Mini, and my Amiga. Out of everything, 
the Amiga was the one item I couldn't let go.

So, with some trepidation, I agreed to let my wife convert the room where my
Amiga lived into a shared study. She is studying at university and never had 
a proper place to work. That room had been my online teaching and Amiga 
room.

                @{"Original Amiga Home" link Images/AmigaHomeBig_1.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/AmigaHomeSmall_1.iff"}

To my surprise, the flat now feels brighter and more open. It's actually 
lovely sitting together, the two of us working side by side. But that still 
left one important question: *Where does the Amiga go?*

Attempt 1: The Oshiire
======================

My first idea was to move the Amiga into the *oshiire* a large cupboard in 
the tatami room (*washitsu*) where futons are stored. It has a big shelf 
that fits a futon... or an Amiga setup.

                @{"Amiga Oshiire Home" link Images/AmigaHomeBig_2.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/AmigaHomeSmall_2.iff"}

It looked great, until I used it. Within minutes I was coughing from all the 
dust futons produce daily. My wife was equally unimpressed, so the oshiire 
was ruled out.

Before I continue, my wife insisted I include this quote: "Japanese women 
are like butterflies... but in reverse. Before marriage we are sweet and 
cute. After marriage *oni-wife*!" She demonstrated this transformation with 
an impressive oni-like expression. I'll let readers judge its accuracy.

Attempt 2: The Surprise Suggestion
==================================

With the oshiire ruled out, I slipped into *doshiyo* mode ("what do I do?").
Meanwhile, my wife calmly sorted the other closet and said, "Why not put the
Amiga on one of these shelves?"

Cue the instinctive Japanese "Ehh?", a sound I once swore I'd never make, 
but twenty years in Japan has worn down my resistance.

I inspected the shelf. Small, yes, but possibly...

I grabbed the monitor and A1200, slid them in, and against all expectations 
it fit perfectly!

                @{"Amiga Final Home" link Images/AmigaHomeBig_3.iff/MAIN}
                @{IMG "Images/AmigaHomeSmall_3.iff"}

It's tight, but with a low chair it's surprisingly usable. The mouse lives 
on a the table next to the closet, hardly a burden. My wife is happy, and 
thus so am I.

Cozy Computing
==============

And so, here I am, writing this article on my Amiga in a closet beside my 
wife while she studies. It's surprisingly cozy, and winter will likely make 
it even nicer. For anyone struggling with space or a spouse who prefers your 
retro gear out of sight, take heart. If I can enjoy my Amiga from a shelf 
in a closet, there is hope.

To be honest, I suspect my wife enjoys my new location even more. Whenever 
she asks, "Where are you?" and I reply, "I'm in the closet, I'm coming out 
now!" she can't help snickering.

As a teenager gaming in my bedroom, I never imagined this future. Living in
Japan brings culture shock, and living with someone from another culture 
adds another layer. But it also brings unexpected solutions, such as closet-
based Amiga setups.

From the new *WhatIFF?* Closet Headquarters, I wish you warm season's 
greetings and a wonderful start to the new year. Now, if you'll excuse me, 
I'm coming out of the closet to make tea for my wife and myself.

============================================================================
@{b}Amiga A1200 Accelerator Reccomendations@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

This guide compares popular options for upgrading your Amiga A1200: PiStorm, 
ACA1234, and TF1260. Each has strengths depending on what you want from your 
Amiga: speed, compatibility, or flexibility.

The A1200´s 68020 CPU was fine in 1992, but many programs, games, and WHD
Load installs benefit from more RAM and faster processors. Accelerator cards 
unlock new performance levels, RTG graphics, and even network support.

@{b}Comparison Table@{ub}
Here is a side-by-side comparison of three accelerator cards:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@{b}Feature / Card@{ub}   | @{b}PiStorm (Emu68)@{ub}    | @{b}ACA1234@{ub}           | @{b}TF1260@{ub}
-----------------+--------------------+-------------------+-----------------
CPU Type         | Emu 68k (Pi)       | 68030@25-50 MHz   | 68060@50-100 MHz
Speed            | 200-800+ MHz eq.   | Mid-range         | High-end
RAM              | Pi RAM (hundreds)  | Up to 128 MB      | Up to 128 MB
RTG Graphics     | Yes (HDMI)         | No                | No
Networking       | Yes (via Pi)       | No                | No
Storage Options  | SD + IDE           | Onboard Fast IDE  | EIDE Connector
Compat. (Old)    | Very good          | Excellent         | Very good
Ease of Setup    | Medium             | Plug & play       | Plug & play
Price (approx)   | £80-£150           | £200-£250         | £300-£450
Availability     | Good               | Good              | Mixed
Extras           | HDMI, net, speed   | High compat.      | Extreme perf.
Best For         | Budget power       | Classic games     | Productivity
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{b}Setup and Installation@{ub}
Setting up each card varies. The @{b}PiStorm@{ub} uses a Raspberry Pi and software 
such as @{b}Emu68@{ub} or @{b}Musashi@{ub}, loaded via an SD card. It should
be noted that it appears @{b}Musashi@{ub} has not been updated in a while
with most preferring @{b}Emu68@{ub} which has frequent updates and also also 
gives better performance. 

Configuration takes some work, but once running, it delivers amazing speed 
and flexibility. While there has been a lot of work on getting the software
more compatible it still lacks the stability of the ACA and TF cards. Also
if you are stickler for small details there is a longer delay during power
on and rebooting than compared to a card with a real 68k CPU.

The @{b}ACA1234@{ub} is the simplest to install. You just plug it into the 
trapdoor slot, and it works immediately. It´s very compatible with older 
software and supports Fast RAM and map ROM features. The onboard IDE also 
gives a nice speed boost of up to 5.6MB/s plus a unique feature is the 
ability to boot from the A1200 PCMCIA slot.

The @{b}TF1260@{ub} uses a real Motorola 68060 CPU, often socketed by the user. 
It requires careful setup and sometimes cooling. When configured properly, 
it offers near 060 workstation-level power. You have several options 
available when purchasing, the most common and cheapest option is the LC060 
which does not contain an FPU. While this is the lowest cost option it does
tend to cause issues when running 060 targeted software as it often presumes
there is a complete 060 with FPU. In this regard buying one without a CPU 
and finding a cheaper rev. 1 or rev. 5 is a better option, you can find 
rev.1s for around £80-100 and rev.5s for £130-180.

@{b}Which One to Choose?@{ub}
If you mainly play games, you´ll want reliability and old-school compatibi-
lity - the @{b}ACA1234@{ub} is ideal. It´s fast enough for WHDLoad and almost 
every classic game.

If you like to experiment or use RTG graphics, the @{b}PiStorm@{ub} is incredibly 
flexible. It supports HDMI, file sharing with your PC, and network access. 
Performance scales with your Pi model.

For productivity, 3D rendering, or demos pushing the limits, the @{b}TF1260@{ub} is 
unmatched. The raw 68060 CPU power lets you run modern AmigaOS 3.2 setups 
smoothly, though heat and cost are factors.

@{b}Verdict@{ub}
In short:

- Go for the @{b}PiStorm@{ub} if you want fast, cheap, RTG, and network
  capability and don´t mind tinkering.

- Go for the @{bACA1234@{ub} if you want maximum classic gaming compatibility.

- Go for the @{b}TF1260@{ub} if you want extreme CPU performance for productivity
  and high-end Amiga use.

Each accelerator brings new life to the Amiga 1200. The right choice depends 
on whether you value flexibility, simplicity, or power.

@node edwinoosterkampinterview -"Edwin van den Oosterkamp Interview"
@toc talkingamiga
============================================================================
@{b}Interview: Edwin van den Oosterkamp@{ub}
============================================================================

@{b}1. First of all, could you tell us a little about yourself and how you first 
discovered the Amiga?@{ub}

My name is Edwin van den Oosterkamp and I was born in a small city in the 
Netherlands called Culemborg. I studied micro electronic design at the 
Hogeschool van Utrecht and have worked for pro-audio/broadcast equipment 
manufacturers most of my professional life. The first computer we had at 
home was a Commodore 64 and at the time most of my friends had one too. 
Later on we all had heard of the Amiga, with loads of colours and even 
stereo digitized sound (imagine that!). Then a close friend bought an 
Amiga 500 and when I saw it I knew I had to have one too. So I saved up 
all money from the Saturday job I did while studying and bought an Amiga 
500 a couple of months later. My friend and I had both been programming 
assembly on the C64 and of course switched over to doing the same on the 
Amiga. 

For me the Amiga is not only about nostalgia, it is also a system I simply 
like to use. I still own both Amigas I bought back in the day (a 500 and a 
1200) and I have always had a desk with an Amiga on it in my study. To be 
honest, in the period between 2000 and 2012 the Amiga may have only been 
powered on once a month or less, but it was on my desk and ready to be used. 

@{b}2. Many Amiga users have heard of the BassMX. For those unfamiliar, could 
you explain what the BassMX board is and what problem it solves?@{ub}

BassMX takes the audio from each of the Amiga's audio outputs, filters each 
so that only the low frequencies are kept and mixes that with the unfiltered 
audio from the other output. For example, it takes the audio from the left 
output, filters it so only the bass is kept and then mixes that with the 
unfiltered right output. It does the same with the audio of the right output 
in order to mix it with the left audio. This way the audio sounds more 
balanced when listening on speakers while at the same time retaining the 
stereo image of the audio. Since it only mixes the bass I decided to call 
it BassMX. 

@{b}3. What motivated you to design the BassMX? Was it something you personally 
needed, or did you see a wider gap in the community?@{ub}

One of my favourite things about the Amiga is the demo scene. Close the 
curtains, turn up the volume and enjoy the show. My Amiga has always been 
connected to my stereo for this reason, but hearing the beat coming from 
only one speaker always kinda bugged me. I could "fix" this with the "mono" 
switch on the amp, but losing the stereo image was too big a price to pay 
for having the beat on both speakers.

The basic idea for mixing only the bass came to me many years ago but I 
never really did anything with it. Until a couple of years ago when on a 
whim I simply tried it out within the Audacity audio editor. It allowed me 
to filter the audio and then flip the channels and mix it back into the 
original audio. I was surprised with how good the end result sounded. I then 
built a prototype on a bit of experimentation board, which kinda worked. 
Then I decided to just design a PCB and make a few of these in case anybody 
else was interested. I did not expect many people to be interested as for a 
lot of people the way the Amiga sounds is part of their nostalgia. But I was 
wrong as a lot of people have told me that they like the effect that BassMX 
gives.

@{b}4. What were some of the biggest technical challenges you faced in designing 
the BassMX, and how did you overcome them?@{ub}

It was not really a big challenge, but the one issue I had was with an old 
phone charger that turned out to be very noisy. It was a 5V charger that 
pre-dated USB chargers but happened to already have the correct barrel 
connector on it. When I tested the first version of the PCB it all worked 
fine until I tested it with this particular old phone charger. This charger 
caused a whining noise in the background. Only audible when the Amiga was 
quiet and the volume was turned up, but still unacceptable in my opinion. 
So I tried out different ways of filtering the power input and in the end 
settled on an active filter that completely removes any trace of the whining 
noise of that phone charger. This was important since I wanted users to be 
able to use any power supply to power the board. I then had to modify the 
design of the circuit board and have these new design boards manufactured 
as well.

@{b}5. You´ve documented parts of the design process on your blog. Do you see 
yourself as more of a hardware tinkerer, a software developer, or a bit of 
both?@{ub}

Both to be honest. And I have always been. For my first proper job I was 
hired to help write firmware for a digital portable recorder. As a hardware 
engineer who knows how to write software, my main task at the time was 
writing the code that interfaced with the hardware. Even recently during the 
recent chip shortage I found myself designing a new audio interface for one 
of our products (as the original chips were no longer available) and 
subsequently adapting the firmware to make it work like the original audio 
interface.

@{b}6. The Amiga scene has always thrived on community projects. How has the 
feedback from users influenced BassMX and your other work?@{ub}

Thinking back, I don't think I would've created BassMX as it is now without 
the nice feedback I've received for my Amiga books. I would probably have 
created the version on experimentation board for myself but not designed a 
PCB and then build a number of them for fellow Amigans to use. What also 
helped was that Dave (Velociraptor) from the "This Week In Retro" podcast 
was complaining about the Amiga stereo separation just when I had received 
the first batch of power-whine-fixed PCBs - this told me there could indeed 
be more people interested in this. When I announced it on a thread on EAB I 
also got a nice response there. I have alo received nice responses from 
musicians and DJs who use BassMX with the Amigas in their setup.

@{b}7. Apart from BassMX, you´ve written books and articles. Could you tell us 
about your writing - what subjects you´ve covered, and how your Amiga 
background influenced them?@{ub}

When I was a teenager I liked to write short stories but depicting 
conversations between characters in the story has always been my weak point. 
I did write a couple of AmigaGuide manuals for some software I released back 
in the day, but that was not really of influence on my professional writing. 
It was really by happenstance that I started writing professional 
documentation for our end users (as in, nobody else wanted to do it). And 
writing technical documentation for non-technical end-users has since then 
always been on my CV as part of my technical skills. The main subject was 
always "How to use the product" and these were not published as such, but 
were part of the product delivery. Of the three Amiga books I wrote the 
first is an introduction into programming the classic AmigaOS, the second 
is about bare-metal programming the hardware and the third is about writing 
Amiga software that uses the network.

@{b}8. Looking back, what role has the Amiga played in your personal and 
professional life?@{ub}

The Commodore 64 and the Amiga both have played a decisive role in my life. 
Programming the C64 taught me a lot about interrupts and programming the 
Amiga taught me a lot about multi-tasking, shared libraries and user 
interfaces. But the Amiga also allowed me to play with samplers, audio 
editors and sound trackers. I would never have started out writing low-level 
code to interface directly with hardware had it not been for the Amiga 
teaching me just that. The Amiga also taught me writing software on systems 
with limited resources like RAM and CPU power. Writing software for embedded 
systems has a lot of similarities with writing software for a stock Amiga in 
that respect.

@{b}9. The retro computing scene is very active today. How do you see the Amiga 
community compared to the early days?@{ub}

Back in the day I had a few friends with Amigas and through one of them I 
knew a bunch of guys running a monthly Amiga meet in a town not too far 
away. Getting hold of software was not easy as we did not have any computer 
stores in our little city. Neither did any of the towns nearby. News about 
Commodore or the Amiga I got by being subscribed to the Dutch Amiga 
Magazine, which was a great read, but only came once every two months. My 
hardware purchases were mostly done at one of two annual computer tradeshows 
in the Netherlands.

Nowadays thanks to the Internet I communicate with fellow Amigans across the 
globe. News about my favourite systems is only a few clicks away. Various 
websites sell Amiga hardware that I can purchase without having to leave the 
house. For me personally the community is therefore much more alive today 
than it was back in the day. The only thing I miss is the daily Amiga 
related chat with my fellow Amiga-owning students - as my work colleagues 
have no clue what I'm talking about.. 

@{b}10. Do you have any advice for today´s hobbyists who want to design their 
own hardware or software for classic systems like the Amiga?@{ub}

Go for it! And ignore negative people who will tell you there is no 
need/point. When my first Amiga programming book was published (in 2019) 
the initial response in a number of Amiga forums was "why?". If I had asked 
there beforehand I would have never started. The Amiga community is rather 
large and varied - there is a good chance that whatever good idea you have 
will be found similarly good by other people in the community. But don't 
set your goals too far ahead, make them reachable. It is better to start 
with something manageable and finish that, than to start something epic and 
lose heart halfway. It is supposed to be a hobby and for fun - don't make it
feel like work.

@{b}11. Finally, what´s next for you - any upcoming projects you can share with 
us?@{ub}

There are a couple of Amiga related subjects that I have in the back of my 
head as a possibility for a 4th book and there are a number of other 
hardware projects that I'm on and off playing with. But since this all 
happens in my spare time a lot of other things take precedence over what 
basically are my hobby projects. Sometimes I lose interest in a project 
(due to something more interesting coming up) and then pick it back up a 
few years later. For these reasons I never announce anything until it is 
ready, as I don't want to promise something and then don't deliver. And 
feeling to be forced to finish something makes it feel like meeting a work 
deadline - something I do not want to introduce into my private life!

@toc talkingamiga
============================================================================
@{b}Interview: Aidan Holmes@{ub}
============================================================================

@{b}1. You've undertaken a wide range of Amiga-related projects in recent 
years, both hardware and software. Could you begin by sharing what first 
drew you to developing for the Amiga platform?@{ub}

The Amiga was my first platform with a C compiler using Dice. It felt like 
my first real programming on an OS although I'd previously used Basic on the 
ZX Spectrum, which never felt close to the real system. I'd only written 
some shell apps back in the Amiga in the early 90s and didn't get much 
further than that.

I came back to development on the Amiga after several hardware projects on 
the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The Amiga is very much like an embedded 
environment and the OS is a great layer sitting on top of that hardware. The 
people around the Amiga also keep me coming back to the projects, with so 
many new ideas and great support from the user community.

@{b}2. One of your most notable recent works is the PCMCIACD.device driver. For 
readers unfamiliar with it, could you explain its purpose and what inspired 
you to create it?@{ub}

The driver supports the external PCMCIA CD-ROM drives created by Sony for 
their Vaio range of laptops. I had an IDE ATAPI CD-ROM drive already working 
on my A1200 and A600 using IDE buffer hardware. It had long ribbon cables 
coming out of the side of the case meaning I couldn't close the Amiga and it 
looked a real mess. That setup didn't make it easy to check out the latest 
CD-ROM from Amiga Future or CD games. At the time e-bay had the occasional 
Vaio CD-ROM selling at good prices and I wondered why we didn't have a 
driver for the Amiga.

@{b}3. What were the main technical challenges involved in enabling the Amiga 
to communicate with modern PCMCIA CD-ROM drives?@{ub}

I had to study a few driver implementations to really get a handle of the 
PCMCIA port and I'd say that the Aros project was a huge benefit for 
reference material. Technically the biggest challenge is the memory 
implementation mismatches between Intel and Motorola. Most PCMCIA hardware 
will be for Intel style PCs, which stopped me getting the full 16 bits of 
data until I picked up on the right code implementation. Following that it 
was just a job of building the ATA and ATAPI implementation required. This 
is well documented, but there were challenges with full SCSI command set vs 
ATAPI and this needed a few patches to provide all the emulation needed to 
support older games.

@{b}4. The Amiga's PCMCIA interface has certain limitations, such as the 
lack of DMA support. How did these constraints influence your development 
process and design choices?@{ub}

Without DMA the CPU has to handle each byte or word of memory and ensure it 
gets written to the device and back to main memory. This isn't really any 
worse than the IDE interface on the Amiga which is also missing DMA. My goal 
really wasn't to have the fastest CD-ROM access, but instead it was to 
improve the experience and have a plug and play driver where you could be 
accessing your compact flash card on moment and then browsing a CD-ROM the 
next. The Amiga PCMCIA can provide the required power without need external 
power supplies, which is a major feature of the Vaio drives, and I think 
this is why the device is so interesting for the Amiga. To answer the 
question properly; I didn't feel constrained with the limitations, and the 
driver could play back CDXL videos at close to 20 FPS.

@{b}5. How would you describe the current level of compatibility of your 
driver? Are there specific drive models or configurations that tend to 
perform best?@{ub}

The PCGA-CD51 is the primary drive, which I'd say is the best CD-ROM. It 
doesn't need external power and just works to plug-in and go. I have a 
CRX75A which is also a burner and probably capable of much higher speeds, 
but it needs external power an it's never the drive I dig out for a game 
or browse a CD. The driver works with the PCGA-DVD51 and also older 
PCGA-CD5 (if the lasers still work). Sony needed to keep backwards 
compatibility with their older laptops so it seems to be a solid range of 
drives that work with 16 bits.

I expect that this driver may work with other manufacturer devices, but 
getting hold of them is either too expensive to bother with or just not 
available.

@{b}6. What has the community response been like to the PCMCIACD driver and 
your other releases? Have you received any particularly useful feedback or 
collaboration offers?@{ub}

I've had a lot of great feedback from the community. Some people just 
saying thanks for supporting the hardware and other people providing useful 
feedback and issues. Everyone has been really patient and I've tried to 
implement as much as I can to make it work with all games. I'm involved with 
the Robin Hood Amiga Group in Nottingham, where I also get to meet up with 
some key folk within the Amiga dev community. Rob Smith has worked on the 
Dynaport driver for BlueSCSI and I built a UI to support the setup and 
diagnostics through some code rework of my PCMCIACD implementation.

@{b}7. Turning to your Amiga Laser Mouse project - what motivated you to 
modernize the original tank mouse design with a laser sensor?@{ub}

It's not my project, but instead one developed by gps79 and Eins. I've 
only picked up on the development of the driver and forked an 
implementation to fix some issues. One odd thing about this project has 
been the disconnect between hardware and software. Eins obviously wanted to 
share the hardware but had concerns about someone commercially creating an 
all-in-one version and profiting. In the end, the dev work was done and 
made available through gps79's firmware. I've tried to tie that together 
again into one place. I can understand Eins concern and could say that the 
PCMCIACD work has had the same outcome with people buying and selling the 
drives for additional profit, thus pushing up prices. Then again, I've made 
the Vaio drives worth something again so there was always going to be an 
impact. This shows how important the Amiga market still is in the vintage 
computer space.

@{b}8. That project required PCB design and firmware modification. Could you 
describe some of the technical considerations and difficulties you 
encountered during development?@{ub}

I can't really comment on the PCB design as it was Eins work. What I've 
found is that the Amiga tank mice have about 4 variations and getting the 
PCB to work in all needs some adjustment. I had to drill a hole in one 
corner because my mouse had a plastic support, whilst other people don't 
have this and their buttons are arranged differently instead.

The firmware was mostly built in gps79's firmware, but for some reason the 
quadrature phasing was incorrect. It was a very simple fix to swap two 
inputs around. I'm not sure if this has been caused by a PCB alteration 
making the firmware incorrect. I fixed it and made it available as a fork 
on my GitHub.

@{b}9. Your External Gotek Conversion project also caught attention. What 
problem were you aiming to solve with that build, and what were the key 
steps in making it work reliably?@{ub}

It was something I documented early on in my return to the Amiga. With so 
many ADFs available I wanted to use this but didn't need or want to remove 
my internal drives. As with anything I do, I document for myself so I don't 
forget what I did and also share with the community.

The Gotek conversation work took the existing drive emulator and built the 
drive into a shell of an old external floppy with 26 pin interface. The 
project shows the mapping of the Shugart 34 pin on the Gotek into required 
26 pin for Amiga external floppy devices. This provided a working example 
for anyone with failing external floppy drives who wanted to reuse as a Gotek.

@{b}10. You have also designed a replacement Amiga power supply using modern 
components. What do you see as the most important factors for ensuring 
safety and stability in PSU replacements for legacy hardware?@{ub}

This was a build from MsMadLemon from her YouTube. There's not a lot of new 
ideas here although I quite like the neon on/off switch :)

@{b}11. Your article on connecting the Amiga to the internet using a Raspberry
Pi demonstrates an interesting bridge between old and new technology. What 
were the main technical challenges in achieving that connection?@{ub}

The Pi is the Swiss Army of the computer world. Nearly everyone has one and 
many are in drawers (I know because I have them). Why not utilise for the 
internet? At the time this was what you would use for network access unless 
you had a PCMCIA network card or big box Amiga. I'd say that this is less 
important now with the Pilpbox, A314, PicoWyFy, Dynaport and PCMCIA cards 
which run much faster than the old Amiga serial port.

@{b}12. Looking across all these projects, what motivates you to continue 
developing new solutions for vintage systems like the Amiga?@{ub}

I wouldn't call myself nostalgic for the old days of the Amiga, but instead 
it's the Motorola 68k at the heart of the machine. I used this CPU in my 
University Labs whilst studying Computer Science and it was deemed the best 
example of a modern processor. I don't actually dev at low level, but I know 
that this is in reach and easy if needed. The practical reason is that I 
still own an A500 and A1200.

@{b}13. Finally, are there any upcoming developments, updates, or entirely new 
projects that you are currently exploring or hope to undertake in the near 
future?@{ub}

I have a few things on the go. The latest one is the Floppy Disk controller 
for the Sony FA-P1. This allows 1.44 Mb PC floppy disks on an Amiga with a 
PCMCIA port. It's pretty cool because you can have a 1.44 Mb Fast File 
System floppy on the Amiga as well as full 1.44 FAT disks you can 
interchange with a PC. It's really retro and probably unimportant with all 
the compact flash, networking and Goteks, but it was a real effort to get 
ready. Implementations are on Aminet and there are still fixes for this to 
get it working, but very much in-progress.

The other, long term build, is a Bluetooth stack for the Amiga. This started 
with PCMCIA Bluetooth card implementations and has got to a point where it 
can pair with a Phone or PC device and exchange files over ObEx. It's very 
basic at the moment and hit it's first milestone with more features to 
follow.

In the near future I expect to pick up some of the driver work ongoing with 
the SPIder hardware from Niklas (author of A314 and PicoWyFy). Niklas has 
a device already built to support SPI devices through the clock port header. 
There's not much more to say at this point, but the SPI hardware opens up 
further networking, MP3 decoding, LED illumination, sensor controls and 
loads of other more modern devices.

============================================================================
@{b}Interview: Dan "Zooperdan" Thoresen@{ub}
============================================================================

@{b}1. Dan, could you start by introducing yourself to readers who may not know
you yet? How did you first get involved with the Amiga, and what originally 
drew you to develop for it?@{ub}

My backstory is not terribly interesting. I'm an old geezer who got my
first home console in 1977 (Conic TVG-SD-01 Pong system). From that point
on computers and games have been a significant part of my life. A life that
changed when C64 arrived, and changed monumentally again with the release
of Amiga 500. Ever since I got my hands on an Amiga 500 in 1987 it's been
my favorite computer. I never even bothered with all the consoles and other
systems that came later. I started early to get into programming. I made my
first simple games using BASIC on a couple of different systems (C64,
SpectraVideo, MSX, Dragon32). Fast forward to recent years and I'm still
making simple games in BASIC, albeit Blitz Basic now. I have decades of
programming experience on PC using a variety of languages, but I find it
cathartic and enjoyable to challenge myself by working within the
restrictions of a retro platform. Blitz Basic offer me the right amount of
challenge while still letting me iterate and create with some efficiency. I
have 4 working Amigas (500 KS1.2, 500 KS1.3, 500+ and 1200) set up for
testing and occasional gaming (That reminds me; I need to get a 600).
People who know me well know that I run dungeoncrawlers.org and am a
hardcore dungeon crawler fan, perhaps even more so than Amiga. Some of my
best gaming experiences have been on Amiga with games like Bard's Tale, Eye
of the Beholder, Dungeon Master and Might & Magic III. I've hosted several
dungeon crawler game jams and also run a dedicated Discord server for fans
of the genre.

@{b}2. Many of your recent projects, like YEET, LUMA, and AmiKlotski, combine
classic Amiga charm with clever, modern puzzle design. What inspires your 
game concepts, and how do you decide which ideas are worth turning into full 
releases?@{ub}

Two of those you mentioned (YEET and AmiKlotski) were suggested to me as
ideas by AmigaLive :) AmiKlotski as a "reimagination" of a PD game called
DAD. Initially I planned to call my game MOM (lol) but ended up with a much
more boring name! Me and AmigaLive often spitball ideas and concepts which
is a great help as a solo developer. Sometimes the hardest part is the game
idea. LUMA is an adaptation of a C64 game by Simon Jameson (Shallan). For
ideas I also visit game sites like Kongregate and Itch.io to find small
golden nuggets which I believe could be a good fit for Amiga. That's how I
found the idea behind PJUSK. It was a small Flash game called HpAtkDef I
found on Kongregate.

@{b}3. Let's talk about YEET! Could you tell us how this project started, what 
the core idea behind the gameplay is, and what makes it unique among your 
previous works?@{ub}

YEET was born through a conversation I had with AmigaLive. We were
discussing various game ideas and he suggested I take a look at a game
called Fling! on iPhone. I liked the concept and started outlining the
project. At first the plan was to just make a single screen game with a
string of puzzles that you go through, but the scope creep monster called
and ordered a lot of fluff and stuff :) What makes it unique for me is
probably that it's the game I spent the most time creating and debugging,
even if it might not look it, YEET has the biggest scope in any game I
made. YEET has been very well received in the community so the three whole
days of fighting mem leaks was well worth it :) The core gameplay is
simple; Push runes of the board until one rune remains. You can only push
runes in a straight line and only if there is at least one tile space
between them. Despite simple mechanics many levels are quite challenging.

@{b}4. From a technical perspective, YEET runs on very modest hardware, just an
Amiga 500 with 512 KB. Was it challenging to make the game fit within those 
limits, and do you enjoy working within those classic constraints?@{ub}

It was a little bit challenging in terms of memory management, mostly
because we didn't want to aggressively reduce the sample quality in the
music. Initially YEET ran on a 500 without 512KB extra, but chiptune style
music were not a great match for the game. As mentioned earlier I had to
find and fix a lot of mem leaks and that was probably the most challenging
part of making the game. At one point I almost gave up the project.

@{b}5. You've mentioned in past Amiga News articles that you use BlitzBasic and
other retro-focused tools. Can you describe your development setup today,
hardware, emulators, workflow, and how you test your games?@{ub}

For the most part I develop using AmiBlitz3 on WinUAE with a souped up
configuration (*040 Super-Hires JIT + tons of memory) but I also sometimes
use my 1200 *030 (128mb ram) for development. As mentioned I have a couple
Amigas that I use to test my games. I think it is important when you are a
developer to test on the actual system(s) you're targeting. My workflow
differs a lot but common denominators are Aseprite for pixel art, Tiled for
level/map creation, Goldwave for audio editing and a bunch of small
homebrew command line tools for various batch operations like png-to-iff
conversion, wav-to-8svx conversion etc. I often use AI as part of my tool
chain but never directly. I use generative AI output as a resource for
further refining or photo-bashing. I use ChatGPT sometimes to help with
mundane tasks like .json/data manipulation, translations, story writing
etc. As a solo developer with limited authoring and graphical ability, and
fairly limited years left lol, I value the help I can get and anything that
can speed up my process is very welcome.

@{b}6. Your games often have smooth design, tight controls, and consistent
presentation. Do you handle all graphics, coding, and music yourself, or do 
you collaborate with other creators for certain aspects?@{ub}

I do all graphics and coding myself, but as mentioned I do get some
starter help here and there by generative AI. I rarely ever make my own
music. I have made some tunes over the years but it takes more out of me
than both the coding and graphics combined. I'm fortunate to know a
demoscene musician who made great music for several of my games. I actually
prefer to work solo. It's hard enough to make games and I don't need the
added pressure of running a project and managing other people.

@{b}7. What part of Amiga development do you find the most rewarding? And what 
part still drives you mad even after all these years?@{ub}

The most rewarding part is definitely working within the limitations. As
a PC developer speed or file optimizations is not even a thing you think
about. Coincidentally; working within the limitations is also what drives
me mad lol. Also, the influx of different hardware upgrades introduces
potential issues we didn't have before. Back in the early 90's when someone
made a game for an Amiga then you knew it would run. That's not always true
today.

@{b}8. The Amiga community seems to be thriving again with new games, jams, and
releases. How do you see the current state of the Amiga scene, and what role 
do you think events like your Amiga Tool Jam play in keeping it alive?@{ub}

The Amiga community is definitely thriving and probably stronger than it
has ever been, mostly because of the way we communicate and share our
passion now with streams, videos, webpages, discords and social media in
general. The fact that one can hop on Twitch any given day and find an
Amiga stream, or that there seems to be at least one game released for
Amiga every week is mindblowing. I firmly believe that jams are an
important component of any community. Whether it's a jam about literary
works, music composition, game or tool development they bring members of
the community together and it invites people to learn and challenge
themselves. As mentioned, I've hosted several dungeon crawler jams which
combined have resulted in hundreds of new games for people to play and
raising awareness to thousands of people. On a personal level attending in
time-restricted game jams is a great motivator and excellent way to learn
time management, planning and how to "complete" a project. I wrote
"complete" because a jam entry are rarely ever fully completed in the sense
of a commercial release-worthy product. It's "completed" because you did
what you set out to; you devised a concept and scope, executed it and
submitted. That feeling is special, and the feedback and interactions with
the community is priceless.

@{b}9. Looking back, how has your approach to game development changed from
your earliest projects to now? Were there any key lessons or "aha" moments 
that shaped how you build games today?@{ub}

If you mean my earliest projects on Dragon32 or C64 in 1982 then a lot
has changed, lol. In more recent years when I picked up developing using
Blitz Basic on Amiga again, there has been a learning curve and an exercise
in trying to remember how I did this and that. The biggest change or Aha!
is definitely the introduction of AI, or more specifically ChatGPT. It
allows me to focus on the game creation part while leaving the boring and
repetitive tasks to AI. I have likely made hundreds of different level
editors, combat calculators, file manipulators, data conversion tools etc.
from scratch over the years, and I'm at a point in my life where I don't
want or need to do those things anymore. That's the biggest help for me now.

@{b}10. If someone today wanted to start developing for the Amiga, perhaps a
younger coder discovering it for the first time, what advice would you give
them?@{ub}

It depends on how much programming experience the person have. Scorpion
Engine is a great place to start getting your feet wet with game creation
on Amiga. It ease you into familiarization about game loops and logic,
sprites, bobs, palette management and even some more complex concepts.
Beyond that I would definitely recommend Blitz Basic and AmiBlitz3. We have
a dedicated Blitz Basic Discord server with a strong, helpful and growing
community. There are a lot of code examples and resources available to get
you going.

@{b}11. Beyond YEET, can you share any hints about what you're working on next?
Is there another puzzle game, or perhaps something entirely different on the 
horizon?@{ub}

I just released a small word search game. It was something I wanted to
do for a while now, because I love these games myself. I am not sure what's
next for me now. I have a couple ideas I'm juggling. In the future I plan
to make a dungeon crawler game but I am not ready for that yet. I still
need a couple more learning projects before I go down that rabbit hole. One
of the ideas I'm entertaining is a deck-builder game with top-down open
world map movement where combat and events are resolved via a card game.
AmigaLive also has some ideas, so let's see what happens :D

@{b}12. Finally, how can fans best follow your work and support your projects?@{ub}

My website is zoopersoft.com which is the home of my "software company"
and has links to most of my stuff. There you'll also find the link to our
Blitz Basic Discord.

============================================================================
@{b}Interview: Electric Black Sheep@{ub}
============================================================================

@{b}1. First, could you introduce yourself and tell us how Electric Black Sheep 
started, is it a solo project or a small team effort?@{ub}

There are two members. Me (László) and my twin brother (Imre). We are not 
a "group" in a classic meaning. We brainstorming ideas in family meetings. 
Our mindset is very similar so making the games for the Amiga is more like 
fun and recreational. Both of us has our own creative side. Imre is the AMOS 
coder. He likes to experimenting with different techniques like processing 
and compressing iff animations, vector graphics or put some interesting 
effect into our games. He made a hell lot of pixel gfx too, the background 
tiles in "Project:Quest" is 100% his creation.  I make gfx too but i'm 
working mostly on the animations (characters, fmv,..), making them pixel by 
pixel or 3d modelling/rendering. 

2. What first captured your interest in the Amiga platform, and when did 
you decide you'd try making new games on it in the modern era?

We have been typing on the keyboard since we were 8 years old, but we only 
switched to Amiga during high school. We didn't know the platform; all we 
knew was that it had good value for money and good capabilities relative to 
that price. As youngsters, we were primarily interested in games, but the 
fact that it could be used for anything else became clear as we went along. 

In hindsight, it was a fortunate choice, as we could both use it for 
graphics due to our visual orientation, so we liked it. Compared to other 
machines of the era, the amiga didn't have limits. We previously practiced 
basic programming on C16, but at this time the knowledge of the software 
needed for programming were missing. There was no internet, and the 
magazines were almost exclusively about games, so there was nothing to pique 
our imagination. (We weren't excited about it; we didn't feel the urge). 

The urge came later, when we dusted it off for nostalgia, but a few things 
were missing, which are easier and cheaper to implement with today's 
mindset. These included, for example, the Arduino mouse emulator, RAM 
expansion, and a DIY HDD controller, and I think the "bug" (interest) came 
with this, along with the ability to get any software online. László deals 
with programming at a professional level, so he thought he would try to see 
what could be squeezed out of such a machine. For the sake of simplicity, 
he chose AMOS, which is closer to modern development environments, and 
created the first version of Star Dust Wars. Its simplicity is how it 
infected me as well. One project followed another.

@{b}3. In your view, what advantages or charms does the Amiga still offer for 
developers and players today?@{ub}

For those who grew up in the 80s, this doesn't need to be explained. It does 
have its limitations, but these machines are not overly complicated. Perhaps 
the limitations were precisely what made the creators consider what and how 
they incorporated into their software, instead of just dumping in 
unnecessary things, claiming that this would make a program "more" and that 
today's machines can handle it anyway... even an infinite loop will run on 
them. So, less is sometimes more, and among retro lovers, it's a platform 
that, while perhaps not usable in everyday life anymore, is not too far from 
modern user interfaces in terms of usability/learnability, yet it's not just 
a blinking cursor.

@{b}4. What is your typical toolchain or workflow when making Amiga games 
(e.g. language, assembler, emulator, testing on real hardware)?@{ub}

Sometimes we just draw, and if it turns out well, it can be the basis for a 
game. In parallel, we also create codes that are not games, just out of 
curiosity. The point of this would be to see how a given thing could be 
done, or if it can be done at all/if we can or want do it later, and how it 
looks/behaves in different environments? Since AMOS is a Basic language that 
also uses fairly specific commands, you can progress with it relatively 
easily and quickly. We primarily work with an emulator, which makes 
preparations and testing easier, but the final tests are also performed on 
real hardware (on A500-A600-A1200 stock or fully expanded with RAM and HDD 
but without accelerator... and we also have a Vampire). So, game programs 
are sometimes created on a sudden impulse when the test codes meet each 
other in the appropriate environment. The main thing is that they should be 
varied, so they possibly provide a challenge and joy not only to the players 
but also to the creators. We start to refine them, build in what is 
necessary, and delete what is superfluous... optimization is one of our 
obsessions, that only that code runs, and only when it is needed. (Respect 
to the retro enthusiasts because the speed of today's machines, some people 
no longer even think about this). By sending the tests and ideas to each 
other, we reach the point where we call something final. We test among 
ourselves; we don't send it out to external people, as we are often not even 
sure of the direction, let alone the final result.

@{b}5. Turning to Star Dust Wars: Director's Cut - how did that project begin, 
and what was your vision for it?@{ub}

I think the project started when We saw in several places that people were 
trying to play video films on Amiga. They tried to get the maximum out of it 
(See: AGABlaster). This was spectacular, but also disturbing. These formats 
are uncompressed, so their size is very large, requiring extremely fast HDD, 
not to mention that a stronger CPU is also associated with it. Those who 
have enough RAM could help themselves by copying it to RAM and playing the 
video from there... but who has hundreds of MB for a 5-minute video clip, 
and why not compress the format!? This is where the process started, from 
which we first created an audio player used in our games that streams the 
data from the storage and occupies only 22kb of RAM. Only the image/video 
part was missing, which involved greater complications, and admittedly, it 
could be better, but it's ours... and it was finally completed, under the 
name AnimPlayer; this player program is the basis of SDWC. The idea seemed 
natural that this AnimPlayer could even run in the background of a game if 
things were synchronized, as we had experimented with something similar 
before, based on the blitter lines used in our Bad Apple demo (vectorized). 

There wasn't really a vision; the whole point of the test was just whether 
we could solve this under AMOS or not, but even if we could, the 
possibilities are quite limited, since it is a pre-recorded animation that 
cannot adapt so well (only to pre-stored changes).

@{b}6. What were the most challenging aspects to making Star Dust Wars, did you
create any custom routines/tricks?@{ub}

Technically... AMOS fundamentally handles animation and sound, but in the 
default case, it does so by fully loading them into ChipRAM. If it doesn't 
fit because we want something bigger, we had to create a workaround for this 
case. We didn't have much trouble with the sound because we only had to 
handle loading and streaming. The animation was a bit tougher nut to crack. 

There are several reasons for this (*I'll explain this in a moment). 

Normally, a drawn animation means an object moves on a static background. 
The IFF anim format we use also supports this by storing only the movement 
from successive frames, thereby reducing unnecessary data volume. We also 
had trouble here because the backgrounds we created moved in full-screen 
size, and if even one pixel changed, the format treated it as (area) change, 
unnecessarily increasing the data volume to the point where it almost no 
longer made sense to store it as IFF anim. Thus, one goal was to reduce this 
data volume, not only because it was necessary, but also because the reduced 
data volume would allow animations to be "streamed" not only from light-
speed HDD. Through a long process of experimentation, we also created a 
program that can significantly filter out unnecessary changes (dithering, 
noise, ...) from successive frames in a specific (but adjustablle) way, 
without destroying the visual experience and also taking the data format 
into account. I haven't seen an example of this type of program.

The part of the program that reduces HAM animations deserves special 
mention, because in that case, due to the nature of the display method, 
changes made to the image may generate additional errors not only in the 
current image but also in subsequent ones.

In our opinion, the result was quite successful, considering the content 
and dynamism of the animations. This pride applies to the finished 
animations, the preparation program, and the player, which could even run 
with 512 RAM... if it can process lthe loaded data quickly. *: Besides 
everything, it's also good to know that the animation command of AMOS 
contains a bug, which acted as an extra incentive for us. The essence of 
the bug is that the address of the last bitplane of a new animation frame 
within that frame cannot point to an address (offset) above 32kb. For those 
who don't know: a 320x256 image occupies 10 kb per bitplane, so problems 
can arise in the anim even in the case of a 16-color (4 bitplane, 4x10=40kb) 
frame. But... fortunately, we managed to fix this bug without external help, 
even though our knowledge of ASM is very... very low. Thus, one project 
actually depended on the other in a positive sense, even on the base (AMOS), 
but all's well that ends well, because the programs and the fix also had 
benefits. The models and animations used in the game were made by László... 
maybe he could have done them on the Amiga with LightWave, but these were 
made on PC... sorry, but we didn't want to wait decades for the render. 
Postscript: If anyone didn't notice, he even managed to implement 3d Hit 
Boxes on the Trenchrun level. (This means that the ships and projectiles 
get stuck on that.)

@{b}7. Thank you for that, aside from Star Dust Wars, you have made many other
well received games. Revenge of the Grinch (2024), was a wonderful game for
the Xmas season, similar to your Dungeon of Evil.

What motivated you to make a festive spin-off like Revenge of the Grinch, 
did it share any code/mechanics with Dungeon of Evil? Were there any 
obstacles during development?@{ub}

We create all our games in such a way that the graphics can be exchanged 
very easily. Not only does AMOS handle this by default, but we also do not 
put any protection on it that would make unauthorized interference 
difficult. This is not just for our own sake; it is also an opportunity for 
people who feel compelled to do so (Modders?). As we mentioned earlier, we 
often create drawings without knowing what they will be good for, and we 
just happened to have a similar themed scribble collection that we just had 
to complete. This results in a win-win situation; it's good for us because 
it's different, and maybe someone likes this one specifically and not the 
original. The atmosphere and intention are always there at Christmas, of 
course, but essentially, a large part of our figures were drawn earlier, so 
they don't get lost forever on our HDD (this can also be a motivation). The 
code, the engine, and the game mechanics are actually 99% the same, just 
fine-tuned for the theme. It also goes with this that the game can mean 
different things to everyone, and the feeling of Christmas can be different. 
We tried not to exaggerate the horror and humor elements in the game 
(e.g., Kevin's skeleton from Home Alone), because not everyone can or wants 
to handle them as they should, ...or as we would like. In our opinion, 
"it's just a game", but we often receive comments that object to certain 
elements, even if it is not the game itself but the most insignificant 
element of the program: an AI-generated loading screen. 

@{b}8. It can be a difficult balance to achieve in today's world, thank for the
game I greatly enjoyed it last year. Another seasonal game you made was 
Pumpkin (2024) a Halloween edition of a Pac-man style game, can you tell us
a bit about the game?@{ub}

Pumpkin was a very good lesson for us. We try not to manufacture our games 
all in the same mould. Observing the appearance of retro games, (I don't 
even know how many) ports of the original Pac-Man game was being published. 
It's an evergreen game, and not looking down on it, but to us, they looked 
the same, with no apparent differences. Thus, none of them offered anything 
new visually. The original game does not contain many graphical elements, 
it would not be difficult to replacicate them in a new form, so we only had 
to create the controller program. Here, we faced the fact of what a 
seemingly simple concept actually conceals. Creating a maze doesn't take 
long. We are fast and efficient in creating Tome maps, but the movement 
methods for enemies we have used so far did not work here, and any 
modifications we would have made to them would not have reproduced the 
ghosts' original behavior pattern. So, we didn't look into how much the 
map design and the movement (personality!) of the ghosts are built upon each 
other, and how unique this is. Incomprehension then turned into interest 
and challenge. Considering all the information, we finally did what we 
could. The ghosts were programmed based on description and observation, we 
don't say they move exactly as they should, but considering all the 
available information, it is a pretty good "approximation" of the original. 

The truth is that Pumpkin would not have been created if we had known what 
was under the skin. We always learn something new... now We even know the 
ghosts by their names. The game originally required 1 MB of chip RAM. Due 
to its simplicity, many may think it was due to negligence. No. In the case 
of AMOS, this level can be easily reached, because automatic graphical 
operations that we unfortunately cannot get rid of also run in the 
background. In the old days, almost all games ran with 512+512 RAM. We 
would support this if possible, but in the present case, we could only 
solve this with compromises, which means a small loss in terms of sounds. 
We completely agree with such requests and comply with them as long as it 
can be carried out without compromising the gaming experience. 

@{b}9. For both Revenge of the Grinch and Pumpkin, how do you balance nostalgia 
(faithfulness to classic styles) vs modern polish (smoothness, effects, 
extra features)?@{ub}

The basis of every game is the mechanics. If this gives the meaning, there 
is no point in changing it, and it shouldn't be changed. The appearance is 
another matter. Old games look the way they do not only because they were 
designed/drawn that way, but also because they had display limitations, 
and often couldn't have looked any other way. At least we have a choice. 
Due to the Amiga's features, it is sometimes not a challenge to make 
something prettier, but it is sometimes harder to make it as ugly as the 
original, but why do that if it's ugly? It is difficult to get the crazy 
movement of Tower of Evil running on C16 out of our minds. It was good as 
it was, but this was mainly due to the capabilities of the C16, but it did 
not really affect the gaming experience. For this reason, the same thing is 
prettier (and more natural) on Amiga, taking the original mechanics as a 
basis but implementing it with smooth movement (in the case of Xzap, this 
is a mission impossible). The snowfall is just the icing on a cake. If that 
were the goal, and the change does not convey the original feeling, then 
let's do something else or not call it that (if it can even be called that 
due to copyright protection).

@{b}10. What kind of feedback have you received from the Amiga community on 
Revenge of the Grinch and Pumpkin? Any bug reports or suggestions that 
surprised you?@{ub}

There are both negative and positive feedback. I (we?) consider it positive 
when we are praised (we carelessly don't react to this; we pocket it and 
move on), and there are also those who provide feedback that can positively 
influence the game and our future work. These include constructive 
criticism, opinions, suggestions, and missing details. We take all such 
requests into account if they are a good idea and do not deviate the project 
too much from the original direction, as that is the essence. There are also 
negative signals that we partially or not always agree with, as we approach 
things differently, so we cannot and do not want to deal with them. Some 
people like it, some don't, ...Ok but we won't be a battlefield.

@{b}11. In retrospect, is there anything in Revenge of the Grinch or Pumpkin 
that you wish you had designed differently, if time and memory weren't 
constraints?@{ub}

No :)

@{b}12. Looking ahead, are there more themed/seasonal games you'd like to build 
(for Christmas, Halloween, etc.)?@{ub}

Currently, there are none. (but the details are included above!)

@{b}Thank you both for your time and answers, it has been a pleasure chatting 
with you and playing your games. I wish you all the best for the new year
and look forward to your next projects.@{ub}

@toc talkingamiga
============================================================================
@{b}Interview: Alinea (www.amiga-shop.net)@{ub}
============================================================================

@{b}1. Could you briefly tell us how Amiga Shop was founded and how you came to 
specialise in Amiga hardware and accessories?@{ub}

The Amiga Shop was actually just a by-product, because Ricco and I actually 
only wanted to found an Amiga software company for the AmigaOS 4. We were 
both studying at the time and then founded the company in 2005. But when 
KDH-Datentechnik, our favourite dealer, closed its doors, we thought we had 
to close this gap and set up an online shop. We only had a few products at 
the beginning and added more and more over time. It didn't really take off 
until 2010, when Ricco left the company and Torsten joined, because he 
wanted to focus more on Amiga hardware.

@{b}2. What does a typical "day in the life" of your business look like?@{ub}

I think it's like in many companies. Early in the morning, all the emails 
are answered and then the orders are processed straight away. On normal 
days, you're done with the orders by lunchtime, but on Mondays, when a lot 
of orders have piled up over the weekend, it can happen that you spend the 
whole day working on orders.

Otherwise, in the afternoon there's production, testing and, of course, 
meetings with Torsten or our developer. Of course, there are also 
administrative tasks such as reordering goods or parts, or tax matters so 
that the tax office doesn't complain.

@{b}3. How has the Amiga-market changed over the last few years (hardware
availability, customer base, global shipping, etc.)?@{ub}

Yes, it has changed, and for the better. When I talk about the market, I am 
mainly referring to the classic Amiga market. The Amiga OS 4.1 market is 
unfortunately still very small and has been rather inactive. But the classic 
Amiga is on the upswing. A lot of hardware is currently needed and the 
demand for software is also increasing. All in all, demand is increasing, 
which of course benefits us greatly.

We ship worldwide, of course. And we would also say that the market is 
growing worldwide. Germany and the EU are very strong. USA, Australia, UK 
too, but the USA is currently a bit of a problem because of the customs 
policy.

@{b}4. What do you see as the biggest challenges and joys in keeping Amiga
systems alive and relevant today?@{ub}

There are various challenges you have with the Amiga. One is certainly that 
the Amiga is getting on in years and there is a need to change the 
capacitors to keep the system working properly. Many people don't realise 
this and troubleshooting is sometimes quite difficult.

But the Amiga users are very loyal and grateful and that is why we are 
always very pleased with our work.

@{b}5. From your perspective, which items are your biggest sellers (hardware, 
upgrades, accessories, software, etc.)?@{ub}

One of the best-selling products is certainly AmigaOS 3.2, but hardware such 
as the ArcadR joysticks or the Gotek drives are also doing very well. Of our 
products, the TV ports, Omniports, the Wodem and the repair kits are doing 
very well.

@{b}6. Have there been any items that surprised you by selling far better than 
expected (or conversely items you expected to sell well but didn't)?@{ub}

Yes, of course, there were items that sold worse than expected and some that 
sold unexpectedly well. The Amiga Beachball is one of the poorly performing 
products. It went very badly for years and at some point I added a ball to 
every order free of charge. Unfortunately, that was a mistake, because after 
a few years the demand for the ball was suddenly there and we didn't have 
any more.

A positive example, however, is the 4-fold Kickrom Flash adapter. We didn't 
think that the demand for such a product would be so high. The Kickrom Flash 
were and are constantly sold out ;)

@{b}7. Do you see any emerging trends (for example: new cases, modern upgrades, 
community-produced items, etc.)?@{ub}

Yes the trend is towards modern coloured cases with LED lighting and 
upgraded hardware like the PiStorm. I think the trend will continue and 
ventilation and tuning systems will be added.

@{b}8. Your website lists many items - do you manufacture some of the hardware
accessories yourselves or work under licence for Amiga-branded or Amiga-
compatible items?@{ub}

Most of our items are third party items that have to be purchased 
externally. In the meantime, however, we also have our own production and 
several developers on hand. We have an in-house developer and various 
external developers from whom we licence the hardware. Production then runs 
entirely through us. Alinea couldn't survive without the product, as the 
margins are naturally much better there than with external products. The 
shop now has over 800 items for the Amiga in its programme.

@{b}9. How do you decide which new products to bring in (or produce) for the 
Amiga community?@{ub}

That was very simple. We developed and produced what we wanted ourselves 
and was not available. We are passionate Amiga users and burn for the Amiga 
every second.

@{b}10. How do you engage with the Amiga community (forums, user groups, retro-
events, etc.) and how important is that community to your business?@{ub}

We are active in the most important forums in Germany, such as a1k.org
forum. We are also active in international forums, but rather sporadically. 
As far as Amiga events are concerned, we are very active and attend almost 
every Amiga event in Germany. The Amiga community there is really very 
active and many clubs and user groups organise meetings and fairs there. 
One of the most important fairs is of course the international Amiga fair 
in Mönchengladbach, the Amiga 40 Germany, which was just recently.

@{b}11. Where do you see the Amiga hobby/market going in the next 3-5 years
(hardware side, restoration side, software side)?@{ub}

I think the market will continue to grow and the number of users will 
increase. One problem is certainly the limited availability of hardware, 
which is reflected in the high prices of the A1200, for example. It is 
currently the most popular Amiga. The prices of the device are currently 
skyrocketing and many people can't afford an Amiga or simply can't get one. 

I hope that we will soon see new boards that can close this gap again. 
TheA1200 or other hardware solutions could contribute to this.

@{b}12. Is there anything you'd like the wider Amiga community (or newcomers) 
to know about your business or the work you do?@{ub}

I would just like to say that the Amiga community is a very great community. 
It's nice to see how much the users love their Amiga and put their heart 
and soul and work into it. We hope that the Amiga will continue for a long 
time to come and that the spirit and innovation it contains will be 
preserved forever.

Stay loyal to the Amiga, because it's worth it!

  My journey with the Amiga started in either '87/'88 when the family got an
  A500 (Back then it was a computer for the whole family), I remember the
  monitor and A500 boxes almost being as high as myself. Before this time I
  had only been exposed to the ZX Spectrum and C64, using the blue Workbench
  for the first time was an amazing experience. When I saw DigiPaint in
  action I could not believe my eyes. From that moment I was a devoted Amiga
  user going through various Amigas, A500+A570, A600, A3000 and A1200. Over
  the years my Amiga has been used to creating digital artwork and for
  making or shall I say trying to make music. Then in the year 2021 I decided
  for some crazy reason that the Amiga scene needed a digital magazine
  similar to Amiga Report. It was my intention to have something that picked
  up where the great Amiga magazines such as Amiga World and Amazing
  Computing left off, providing a more serious look at Amiga usage through
  tutorials and reviews.

  it's using his CDTV for email, playing Internet radio through his
  bluetooth speakers from his Amiga 4000, or talking to the world via the
  ISS from either. If people say the Amiga couldn't do it, he's probably
  looking for a way to do it. Steve writes his WhatIFF articles mostly

  Like many Amiga users my first computer addiction was the mighty
  Commodore 64! One day close to Christmas of 1986 I drove to my local
  Commodore store called Comspec...I was in high school and played rep
  hockey at the time and didn't have the time I used to when I was in grade
  school to visit Comspec each weekend to check out the latest magazine and
  games. Imagine my surprise when I stepped into the store and immediately in
  front of me was THE AMIGA! It was looping the Defender of The Crown intro
  and I fell in love instantly! From that day on it was my mission to buy
  that Amiga but I had just worked a few part time jobs to help pay for my
  first ever used car and didn't have a hundred bucks to my name lol. The
  Amiga was close to $2,000 Canadian dollars (after taxes) and unlike my
  C64 my parents didn't fall for the 'I need it for school' rant again.

  To (try) to make a very long story short I didn't save up to buy my Amiga
  until I started University in 1989. In the mean time I saw another Amiga
  called the Amiga 500 at Comspec and it was a lot cheaper than THE AMIGA
  but my eyes and heart and soul were only set on THE AMIGA! When I finally
  bought it that was the proudest/happiest moment I've ever felt and I
  jumped straight into University with Excellence! word processor and
  Logistix spreadsheet/ database. In my 2nd year I bought my first ever
  hard drive, a whopping 33MB which had its own case which sat atop my
  Amiga 1000 case. Later fast ram side cars showed up and I mingled with
  Manx Aztec C compiler in computer science class. Of course all the great
  games with awesome music/sound effects made my Apple/PC friends envious!

  By my 3rd year we had a small Amiga computer club and a few of us got our
  first accelerator boards for our Amiga which was called LUCAS and was
  based on a design in a Transactor magazine. It had a 68020 at 16 MHz with
  FPU on it and it really helped out with the more complicated spreadsheets
  and compiling programs. Life was good, the internet was just starting up,
  I graduated University and got my first full time job and then the bad
  news of Commodore going bankrupt hit the newspapers, magazines, and BBS
  boards! There was so much activity going on still in user groups and
  computer stores so us Amiga users just figured that it would sort itself
  out. At work  there were only PC's running AutoCAD and I despised using
  the early Windows systems and couldn't wait to get back home to my Amiga.
  Over the years busy with work and 'adult life' many of my Amiga friends
  moved on to PCs and I ended up getting my first Amiga 1200 and later
  Amiga 4000 for great prices. I was still amazed how the Amiga community
  was still active and so helpful up to the early 2000's. By then I was
  married and working harder than ever to save up to buy a home instead of
  renting an apartment and my Amiga's were left at my parents house until
  around 2010 or so I read about a brand new Amiga which was coming out
  based on PPC CPU called the AmigaONE X1000 running a new AmigaOS4. I was
  skeptical at first after hearing about the technical issues with the
  earlier SE, XE boards with the initisal AmigaOS4 release but after
  consulting with some friends I joined the beta test team to get one of
  the first X1000 boards and I immediately felt at home with AmigaOS4.1
  and have used it as my home Amiga ever since. Once I got some space set
  up in my house I got my Amiga's out of my parents house finally and
  eventually my original Amiga 1000 sits next to my AmigaONE X1000 and
  original C64 and of course my Amiga 1200 and 4000 came along too and with
  new accelerator cards and ram boards and spare motherboards and parts
  etc etc etc. Here I am today grateful to the Amiga computer and
  especially to the amazing Amiga community who back then and today has
  always been resilient, creative and helpful !

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}

  My journey with the Amiga started around 1988, The first time seeing the
  Amiga 1000 in the shop window playing animations such as the @{b}Amiga Juggler@{ub}
  I fondly remember. My Brother and I saved up for an A500, and eventually
  bought an A4000 (cybervision 64 card) and then an A1200 with an 030
  accelerator. I loved collecting every Amiga Magazine with demo disks. My
  interest in game designing for the Amiga started with deluxe paint and
  I did dabble with @{b}The Miracle Keyboard@{ub} but that skill in music
  didn't last. It is because of the Amiga that I now work in video
  animation and game design.

  Danish Amiga fan since the 90s. Started with a 1200 and a 1200 is my
  machine today. I am interested in the casual and the philosophical
  aspects of the Amiga computer.

  My cats enjoy Turrican.

  Rob has been making music on Amiga ever since in the mid to late 90's
  his guitar teacher suggested that he get a drum machine to practice along
  to, and he instead opted to use OctaMED on his Amiga 500+ with A590 to
  craft beats and basslines

   @{b}Bio:@{ub}

   I was introduced to the Amstrad CPC464 at age 10, and had a great
   childhood because of all the BASIC coding I could do. I am also a
   musician. And when I discovered I could program my Amstrad to play music,
   by inputting tons and tons of DATA lines, things became even more
   interesting.

   When everyone left the Amstrad CPC in favour of either the PC or Amiga,
   I stayed with my trusty CPC464 - until a couple of mates lured me over
   to the Amiga many years later. Since no one ever introduced me to options
   like AMOS or Blitz Basic, it sadly meant that my coding days were over -
   for a period of time anyway. Instead, I used my Amiga 600 for lots and
   lots of Protracker MOD creations.

   From 2012 to 2017 I wrote "8-bit Memoirs", which is a semi biography
   about those good old days. Download from www.8bitMemoirs.com

  Manical started making music for the Amiga in early 2021 (December) and has
  released at some demoparties, and is planning to go to more along the
  way. He's in the demogroups MoonShine and Hokuto Force as a musician, and
  soon to be a coder or graphician. He started out with Protracker for his
  first 3 mods, then moved to FastTracker primarily, and then he started
  exploring Impulse Tracker and started making tracks with Furnace. His
  songs have gotten good reviews by many famous people in the demoscene,
  such as Jammer, Purple Motion, Skaven, and cTrix (Most known for his
  gAtari). Since his music journey, he's entered Syntax 2021, Mysdata 2022,
  Boozedrome VI (Which his track that he entered ended up on the official
  Boozedrome tape which was limited to 50 copies).

  Like a lot of us I got my first computers during the late 80s and 90s,
  an exciting time for home computer owners. It seemed like every week
  brought something new and there were loads of computers and accessories
  to choose from. If you had the budget ;) My family had a Spectrum and
  then a BBC Micro but *my* first computer was an Amiga 500, all generous
  hand-me-downs from my uncle. I did play games of course - Lemmings,
  Pinball Dreams and Stunt Car Racer spring to mind but I also loved
  messing about in Deluxe Paint, eventually becoming half decently
  productive. I never had a console and I was never interested in truth,
  actually I don't think I really played on a console until my friend got
  a Playstation. An A500 Plus came next and then in March 93 I upgraded
  to an A1200 with a "huge" 80 MB harddisk!

  It was with the A1200 and its harddisk that I was really able to get
  into productive computing as well as enjoying the new AGA specific
  games.  I loved Animating with Deluxe Paint 4, I knew Wordworth inside
  and out got into generating fractal landscapes with VistaPro and 3D
  rendering with Real 3D. I would spend countless hours in Workbench,
  setting it up just the way I liked, I made my own icons very much
  inspired by MagicWB. Soon enough I need more performance and added a
  Blizzard IV, Squirrel SCSI and CDROM and I figured out how to make an
  RGB cable for my specific telly. Still... After Commodore went
  bankrupt and the chances of a successor to the A1200 evaporated I saved
  up and was able to buy a secondhand A4000 complete with 1942 monitor.

  The A4000 was amazing, even more so when I loaded it with a Cyberstorm
  Mk-III and a Cybervision 64/3D (with scandoubler) and maxed out the
  RAM. I had a eventually got a 17" monitor and ran Workbench in an
  unimaginably spacious resolution - compared to 640 x 512 anyway. By
  this time I was a long time loyal Amiga fan and enjoyed simply upgrading
  and pushing the limits, way beyond anything my younger self could have
  imagined. My A1200 was rehoused in an Infinitiv tower case and even ran
  Linux, launched from within Workbench. My A4000 spent some time as a
  Mac thanks to ShapeShifter and was my first computer to go online with a
  56K modem! I knew I was fortunate to have these computers and upgrades
  and it was hard to leave them behind when I left the country.

  It's funny. Years pass, you forget things - you don't even realise you
  miss things and then someone releases a Mini A500 thingum and you start
  watching retro channels. Soon you end up on eBay and a week or two
  later you boot up an A500 for the first time in... Let's say a while. I
  kept nearly all of my Amiga gear, all apart from the very first A500 and
  A500 Plus. I was able to collect everything from my childhood home
  where it had been mostly stored safely all this time and bring it back
  with me. Now I have them again I hope to share my experiences with
  repairing, restoring and upgrading them with modern stuff over the
  coming months and years, maybe my trusty A4000 will boot once more!

  It was an amazing time to experience and I'm glad I can do so again with
  a fresh perspective.
