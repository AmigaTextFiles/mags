Amiga's not building hardware...  Still surprised?
-----
Last week in this newsletter I eluded to a theory of mine 
(it's no more than that) which stipulated that Gateway will 
be (one of?) the first companies licensed to build hardware 
around the new Amiga technology specs.  Over this past week, 
my staff and I have been inundated with requests for information 
and e-mails from a lot of people who were just plain shocked at 
the idea that Gateway would build machines based on Amiga 
technology.

Let me reinforce the fact for you that we here at Amiga.org do NOT
have insider information.  We don't work with, or for Amiga or 
Gateway directly, so we don't know what's really happening.  As
I stated last week, it is my "belief" that Amiga is designing the
new technology specs (both hardware and software) to license out
to third-party companies.  It is also my "belief" by simple logic
that Gateway (the parent company of Amiga Inc.) would be the first
to take advantage of said technology since they've been quoted as 
saying "we intend to make 30% of our income from information 
appliances in the next few years".

The fact that Amiga isn't going to build hardware has been openly 
stated since almost day one of their existence (except for the 
nasty MCC fiasco).  Unfortunately since we've all been so used to 
owning machines labeled either "Commodore" or "Amiga" for the last 
15 years, it's almost impossible for us to really comprehend buying
a "Sony", "Gateway", or a "Panasonic" device built around "Amiga 
technology".

I understand the confusion and resistance to that idea.  I really 
do.  It wasn't until about six months ago though that I really 
accepted what that meant, and in my humble opinion, it's a mixed 
blessing.

Since the introduction of the Commodore Amiga in 1985, this 
community has always had a fierce loyalty to a name brand as well 
as the machine.  That name brand on the box was always either 
Commodore or Amiga.  We've always had one of 10 or so models of 
the machine with which to "thumb our noses" at PC and Macintosh 
users because our machines have always been (simply put) better.

Under Amiga's plan of building and licensing technology, the rules
of that game might change. Amiga isn't building, or branding their
own hardware, they're licensing others to build machines.  That
means that we might never see another "Amiga" labeled machine, but
does that really matter?  

In the fierce loyalty department, it might, because there's not 
going to be a single banner to rally behind, instead there will be 
dozens, all who share the common soul of using Amiga technology.

Instead of a single "Amiga MCC", we might see things like a 
"Gateway Destination II", or a "Sony Ethos laptop" or even a 
"3Com Boing! PDA".  Each machine different in it's design and 
purpose but each sharing common roots.  Each capable of talking 
between one another without having the problems that Windows 
machines are just now beginning to think about fixing. In the 
end, we might see literally hundreds of machines and 
"Internet/Convergence appliances" based on the new Amiga 
technology rather the old way of putting out one new model every
year and a half.

Is it your so-called "classic Amiga"?  Certainly not.  Are the 
pending changes to the Amiga universe for everyone?   Probably 
not, but in our opinions here at AO, it's going to be a VERY 
interesting ride.

Your Opinions?

No Update next week (for November 5th, 1999) ?
subtitled: "Just where do you think you're going"?
-----
Yes, that's right...  Maybe?  I'm talking with Kent and Wayne to 
see which wants to put out the update.  Unless something major
breaks next week, it's likely that we just won't have the time.

Why no update next week?  In two days, Melissa and I are going on 
a much needed vacation for a week+.  Not unlike migratory birds, 
we're headed south for the winter.  Jamaica and Mexico actually, 
which is a long story in itself.  

It would seem that over the last couple of years, I've consumed all 
of my vacation time to attend shows and events for both Amiga.org 
and the User Group Network (UGN).  As such, my wife and I haven't 
taken an actual vacation together in over two years.  Early in 
January, I was given notice that this year would be different.  
I was furthermore instructed that we'd save our pennies and that 
for Halloween (our favorite holiday), I would be taking my wife to 
Salem, Mass. for the annual festivities.  

After several days of research, we came to the miraculous 
conclusion that it's more expensive to go to Salem at Halloween 
($400 USD+ per night) than it is to go to Mardi Gras in New Orleans 
($250/night in the French Quarter).  Since we haven't got massive 
amounts of stock options just lying around that we can cash in, 
Salem was out.  Back to the drawing board.

After much deliberation, we decided to maximize the whole Halloween 
thing so here's what we decided.  Saturday, we'd head down to New 
Orleans for the pre-Halloween parties and activities.  Sunday (Oct 
31'st) has us boarding a cruise ship headed for the "El Dia de los 
Muertos" (aka:"Day of the Dead") festival in Cozumel Mexico.  From 
there, it's a long loop around through Montego Bay where we'll see 
the "House of the White Witch" and the Grand Caymans.


Sincerely, and see you in two weeks :-),
