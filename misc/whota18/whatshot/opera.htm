The following article contains information on a new web browser called Opera, 
from Opera Software.

On October 10, Opera Software launched Project Magic, a unique initiative to 
gauge interest in Opera, our marvellous web browser, for operating systems other 
than MS Windows. We wanted to know from users of these OS...
<OL>
<LI>whether they would be interested in an alternative browser
<LI>how much they'd be prepared to pay over and above the envisaged $35
<LI>whether they'd be prepared to prefund the development of the products
</OL>

<FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="images/pm_screen1.gif"><IMG 
SRC="images/pm_screen_sm.gif" align=right height=263 width=350 vspace=3 
hspace=15 alt="Don't try this with your browser! -- Well, with graphics switched 
off,  you can't really see Opera in all its glory. So switch them on! This is a 32k GIF 
image that is a link to a 74k 800x600 (48 colors) image that shows you what 
Opera can do - and will be able to do for you, too!"></A></FONT>

Now this is not really common in software circles; neither the research method, nor 
asking for payment before the product has even been released - never mind 
designed. My initial thought was that there must be many users out there, tired of 
being caught in the browser war, tired of instable bloatware and 'kitchen sink' 
products that require more and more hardware just to surf (or is that 'paddle'?) the 
web. And boy was that assessment spot on!
<P>
In only seven weeks, we received in excess of 3000 emails from like-minded 
supporters, pledging orders for anything between 1 and 100 copies upfront - 
unseen! Some declared us crazy -- and we can't even fault them for that --, but the 
overwhelming majority was in support of Project Magic.

"I want to send a message to those browser giants that the free lunch is
over, and that the time of Win dominated software development has seen
its day. OS/2 and other alternative OS's are on the rise." - J. Jones

</FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
It wasn't only pledges we got; we also received hundreds of tips and tricks, contacts 
and suggestions -- information and intelligence companies would spend thousands 
of $$$ on. But to us it came all free of charge, only by showing our prospective 
customers that a) we can code (the product speaks for itself!) and b) that we really 
care. 
<P>
Obviously, due to the nature of the project, we wanted to convince visitors that this 
initiative is  worth supporting, and pointed them to our <A 
HREF="http://www.operasoftware.com/guestbook.html">guestbook</A>, to read 
what customers of ours had to say about the company and the product. Well, have 
a look yourself - it needs no commenting.
<P>
The initial idea was to get 3000 orders per platform, because that would have 
shown us that there is sufficient interest in these alternative Opera versions. 3000 
only because the resulting $100k would have been enough to hire programmers to 
tackle the projects - and complete them -, but it was far more important to gauge 
market sentiment and price points than to reach the 3000.

"I think the problem with the freeware thing is that MSIE and Netscape
(as free as it gets) are not what I think of as freeware; they're not
gifts to the community, they're marketing tools for server software.</B>
<P>
<B>In some ways, distributing Opera as shareware (or whatever you're
calling it) is good, it makes clear that how Netscape and Microsoft
are abusing the concept of "freeware" is unacceptable." - D. Powers
</B>
</FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
I haven't counted the orders, only the emails, and although we hit 1200+ on both 
Mac and OS/2, the actual number of orders is about 75%-85% higher than the 
number of emails received. Needless to say that these two platforms enjoy priority, 
and we are currently busy negotiating with various parties to make these 'ideas' 
come true. 
<P>
Linux? Well, personally, I am a bit disappointed by the response from the Linux 
users. Those that pledged were very (if not extremely) supportive, both with 
pledges and advice. But I expected more than the 500+ we got. Granted, our 
publicity was limited, but nevertheless, if there are millions of users out there, there 
surely must be 1000+ who'd be prepared to support a quality product such as 
Opera. Unfortunately not so; maybe there are too many flavours out there and a 
user base that is too used to free software. Although we have some very interesting 
pledges, this version may have to wait a while.
<P>
BeOS? Amazing; simply amazing. Not only did the BeOS initiative get off to a late 
start, but looking at the current status and user base of BeOS, I think the numbers 
of pledges are just superb. Not large in numbers, but compared to other operating 
systems, tried and tested, and with a user base in the millions, it was a sterling 
effort. In addition, the average pledge was about $20 more than we asked for. An 
efficient, streamlined browser for an efficient and streamlined OS? Sounds like an 
ideal match to me. 
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#bf0000><B>Thank you!</B></FONT>

First of all I would like to extend my personal thanks to ALL of you who have 
supported Project Magic; be it with pledges, information, contacts, by putting the 
PM button onto your page and by (still) spreading the news amongst friends and 
colleagues.
<P>
I would also like to thank Richard Karpinski at InternetWeek for his <A

Thank you also to all newsgroup moderators, who have posted PM announcements 
on the many groups out there. 
<P>
Thank you to many more unnamed supporters and idea-providers. Thank you!
<P>
Last but not least, I would like to thank Jon von Tetzchner, Technical Director at 
Opera Software, for eventually giving in. It took me several weeks to convince him 
that we should be doing this, but I know how he feels now. Thanks, Jon. ;-) Thanks 
also to Sandra Thorbjørnsen for helping me wherever needed. 
<P>
Last but not the very least, in my lunatic fit, I'd like to thank myself for 
accomplishing something other companies spend millions and millions on: creating 
awareness for› their product. Whereas they run expensive advertising campaigns, 
buy entire media, channels and middlemen to get the people use their products, I 
did it by simply 'hijacking' other platforms - by putting a Mercedes billboard into a 
BMW showroom. A simple yet brilliant idea at the right time and place - and it cost 
me nothing but some late nights in front of the PC and some serious surfing with 
Opera.  ;-)
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#bf0000><B>What you do if you have no 
money...</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE=1 noshade align=left width=70%>
If you can't buy media at horrendous cost and with limited results, you need to 
think smart, and I think this has been accomplished full and well. With Project 
Magic I got thousands of people, who have never heard of Opera before, to come 
to our site and see what the 'Magic' is all about. And this was all I had to do, 
because once they've seen and tested the product, it was speaking for itself. No 
traditional advertising and PR needed. No fat budgets, no hyped-up creative 
nonsense.
<P>
Is this the way 'good' companies with 'excellent' products will do their marketing in 
the future? Could well be. But it for sure is a slap in the face of the big browser 
manufacturers. Not that I say this, but the user of their products (Have a look <A 
HREF="http://www.operasoftware.com/pm_feed.html">here</A> to get ample 
proof). They might get ecstatic 
over market share percentages... 'which one is leading', 'which one can add more 
proprietary tags to make the Web even more (sub-)standard and hostile', 'which 
one can add more code-bloat that the user despises to the extreme'..., but they all 
fail to see that people are often using it because there's no alternative, not because 
the products are any good.

"I am so sick of the lethargic performance of Netscape, and I won't even consider 
the bloated and clunky IE, so of course I am all for a streamlined browser. In fact, 
I've been lamenting the lack of one since the demise of Mosaic. By all means, put 
me down as a MacOS supporter and pre-pledger."  - Anon

The user feedback link above is just a tiny fraction of emails we got that express the 
user's dissatisfaction. "Instable, crashes often, slow, bloated, features I don't need, 
they never responded to emails I sent them" are but a few user sentiments that we 
received. We have hundreds more, many of them much harsher than these.  Oh, 
and you should have seen the original name 'variations' users came up with... I 
won't mention them though. :-&gt;
<P>
But be it as it may, Project Magic was a sound success. And while I was spending 
endless nights to respond to several hundreds of emails, trying to allay fears, 
establishing new contacts and exploring new avenues, my dear friends eleven 
thousand kilometers further north spent endless nights improving the product - 
implementing user requests. Without them, PM would have never worked in the 
first place.
<P>
Opera 3.0 for Windows has just been officially release, with lots of new and really 
useful features and enhancements, and above all with a brandnew hotlist that will 
once again put all others to shame. And 'no', although we have added a new 
hotlist, Javascript, SSL, server push, Netscape plugins and a lot more, we have 
added a mere 400k to the 790k download size, making it a meagre 1.2MB+ 
download. Quality is definitely in the numbers (or lack therof).
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#bf0000><B>The road ahead</B></FONT> (pardon the 
pun)
<HR SIZE=1 noshade align=left width=70%>
Gosh, you have made it that far! ;-) The November 30, deadline was just an official 
cut-off date to count the numbers and to determine its success or failure, but not its 
officiall end. If you would like to support us, you can do this all the way until the 
final release! This page will stand as it is, but we will of course keep you posted 
here about the progress we are making.
<P>
We haven't yet decided whether to actually ask for upfront payment, but we will be 
contacting you if this becomes reality.
<P>
All in all, you have shown us that there is a dire need for a small and efficient 
browser, and we hear you loud and clear. We thank you for your support and 
appreciate your <A HREF="mailto:magic@operasoftware.com">further 
input</A>.

<B>Update - 25 December 1997</B>
<P>
From all of us at Opera Software, Seasons Greetings and may you make 1998 a 
happy and healthy year. <P>
You may be pleased to hear that we have just signed contracts with the OS/2 
developers, and expect coding to commence any time now.

"It's about time that someone recaptured the spirit of Mosaic and created a browser 
for The Rest Of Us. We don't need groupware. We don't want bloat. We don't 
want some big server corporation's idea of a marketing tool. We don't want to see 
our zippy new Macs to crawl like they're slogging through molasses. We *certainly* 
don't need "push technology" used to shove marketing down our throats."  - W.

We are also getting closer with a Mac development group, and hope to do the 
same there within the coming weeks.
<P>
We have also been approached by a company offering their help to develop a 
Linux/X11 version of Opera. We hope to make progress on that front too.
<P>
Be is still a bit undecided, mainly because we are talking more of a complete 
rewrite rather than using most of the code as is. Be, Inc. has offered us tremendous 
help, and we hope to be able to make use of their resources soon, too.
<P>
With regards to numbers, the Mac users have once again shown that they believe in 
small and efficient software, and have added more than 400 votes in the past three 
weeks. Our special thanks in this regard go to Netbits for carrying an Opera-
writeup, as well as again Guy Kawasaki of Apple's EvangeList for carrying every 
single PM update. Thanks, guys!

<B>Update - 07 January 1998</B>
<P>
Happy New Year to all of you from us at Opera Software! Today, the 7th of 
January 1998, is a special day. Today, we got the 2000th vote from the Mac 
community, who is throwing all their support behind Project Magic. Thank you very 
very much! It means an awful lot to us, and we will do everything in our power to 
provide you with the best browser ever on a Mac computer.
<P>
But now some progress info: you know that the OS/2 contracts have been signed, 
and we will soon post a press release announcing happier times for OS/2 users. ;-) 
Our negotiations on the Mac front have come relatively far, but there are still some 
issues to sort out. However, if you know of a qualified, willing, motivated and 
reasonable team of programmers for Mac, UNIX and BeOS, please let us know. We 
are always looking for professional partners in this exciting venture. Several other 
things are happening behind the lines, and all I can tell you is that they are really 
good and promising, so stay tuned for more.

<B>Project Magic extended to Amiga</B>
<BR>
A mail by Mikael Svensson from Sweden finally convinced me to add the Amiga 
platform to Project Magic. Welcome! I 'made' Mikael the PM-Amiga man, so 
whatever comes from that, it will be to his and other Amiga users' credit.
<BR>
<BR>


<FONT COLOR=#bf0000><B>Here is your chance! Pledge your 
support!</B></FONT>
<P>
Before you get all excited, let us remind you that we are battling against multi-
million  -- even multi-billion -- dollar companies, so it will not be easy going. 
Nevertheless, whereas they <B>have</B> to spend millions on advertising to get 
your attention, we rather spend time on creating sound relations with our customers 
-- based on mutual trust and respect -- because after all you are our best 
advertising.
<P>
Finally, before you go ahead and add your name and commitment to the project, 
you may want to read what our friends have said about us in our <A 
HREF="http://www.operasoftware.com/guestbook.html">guestbook</A>. This 
should be reassuring enough to take part in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000080> Opera sticks to the HTML standard</FONT>
<P>
It is becoming a nightmare for website developers to make their pages 'best 
viewed' with one of the big browsers. Using Opera, you know exactly that your 
pages are best viewed with any browser. You will soon use Opera as your standard 
reference browser to make sure that your pages are open to all, and not just to 
those with a specific browser.

<LI><FONT COLOR=#000080> Sophisticated and speedy web browsing with 
Usenet newsgroups and simple Email.</FONT>
<P>
Although pretty simple, the mail and news features will be extended and enhanced 
in the near future. We may even spin them off into separate modules. This will then 
mean one small, fast, lean and mean program for all your needs. And if you are an 
advanced user with your own email and newsreader, Opera links to all of them!

<LI> <FONT COLOR=#000080>Opera is extremely small and very 
fast.</FONT>
<P>
It also runs on older PCs; a 386SX with 8MB RAM is already sufficient. Do you 
know what that really means? <B>The best possible protection of your computer 
investment.</B> Not really a big issue when it's just a home PC, but if you are in 
a corporation  with hundreds and thousands of PCs, using Opera translates into 
<B>saving millions on upgrade costs</B>. And with the trend going towards a 
NetPC, Opera might be your <B>lifesaver</B>.

<LI> <FONT COLOR=#000080>Opera is <B>your</B> product.</FONT>
<P>
Dozens of customer suggestions have found their way into Opera. We are very keen 
to get your input on Opera, because we are developing it for <B>you</B>, and 
no-one else. We have a <A 
HREF="http://www.operasoftware.comquestionnaire.html">questionnaire</A> 
online, so if you'd like to tell us a few things, fire right away!

<LI> <FONT COLOR=#000080>Opera is ideal for disabled users.</FONT>
<P>
Using Opera as a disabled user means being able to access the Net quickly and 
efficiently. Only Opera makes it possible to <A 
HREF="http://www.operasoftware.com/keyboard.html">navigate entirely with the 
keyboard</A>, <B>bringing joy and happiness to many thousands</B> of 
visually or physically handicapped friends all over the world.

<LI> <FONT COLOR=#000080>Opera is flexible. </FONT>
<P>
Whether you are a looking for an Internet browser or an Intranet client, an info 
kiosk, CD-ROM front-end or offline browser, Opera can be tailor-made to suit your 
company's needs.  You can develop your content in HTML, and publish it using 
Opera. <B>Quick, cost-effective and reliable</B>. And with all the benefits a full 
screen has compared to a fixed resolution!


<LI> <FONT COLOR=#000080>Opera is unique.</FONT>
<P>
 Whether it's the customisation or the online graphics toggling, the multiple 
windows with individual settings, or the superb if different address list, Opera offers 
<B>features you won't find anywhere</B> else.

<LI> <FONT COLOR=#000080>Opera is powerful.</FONT>
<P>
With <B>version 3.0</B> JavaScript and server push, SSL and Netscape are all 
included in a small download package. This means access to more websites, online 
banking and secure transfers without additional modules, and more <B>diversity 
and versatility while browsing</B>. Obviously, all 'new features' can be turned off 
any time.

<LI> <FONT COLOR=#000080>Opera is simple.</FONT>
<P>
<B>Installation is a breeze</B> and takes less than 30 seconds. It doesn't eat up 
your hard disk space either. Requirements are about 1.7MB.

<P>
But there is more:
<UL>
<li> Opera is written from scratch and is not based on the code of Mosaic or any 
other browser. Opera can run independently under Windows 3.1 and does not 
require Win32s.
<LI> You can choose font type, color and other presentation parameters for 
headers (H1 - H6), normal and preformatted text, forms and newsgroups.
<LI> Opera has advanced link presentation:  Choose color, 3D button, bold, 
underline, strikethrough, etc.
<LI> Opera lets you link to your favourite email client if you so wish.
<LI> Opera lets you save global and local home pages.
<LI> Opera lets you retrieve all elements of a hotlist (bookmarks) with one click.
<LI> Opera lets you retrieve documents in the background, without 
resizing/moving your current document window.
<LI> and much more...
</UL>
<P>
<H4><Font color="#c10000">Window 
Management</FONT></FONT></H4>
<P>
With Opera you can view multiple documents at the same time. The documents are 
shown within a familiar user interface where you can easily tile and cascade the 
documents. Opera even has  a built-in auto-tile function, which, if you prefer, can 
also switch off. Opera has a zooming function and supports <A 
HREF="http://www.operasoftware.com/keyboard.html">full keyboard 
navigation</A>, which makes it ideal for visually impaired net surfers. In fact, 
<B>it's the only serious web browser that can offer this!</B>
<P>
Opera fetches multiple documents and images at the same time. The documents are 
loaded faster and you need not wait for a single document. You can just browse in 
another window.
<P>
Multiple downloads are also possible at the same time - all in one special download 
window.
<P>
<B>Start with multiple windows</B><br>
Opera can start up with a number of windows. Opera can also start with the same 
setup as when you last exited. Each window can be with or without graphics and 
have its own home page. Other settings for the window are stored as well. 
<P>
These window settings can also be restored while the program is running, adding 
extra power and flexibility to your web surfing.

simple mail
window for sending messages to persons or to news groups. The news system 
allows you to
use multiple windows for groups and messages. Each news window has its own 
button bar for quick navigation and management.

user
choices. Used with care this system is useful for hiding items froms the users; 
including proxy
servers and network choices. 
<P><B>Global hot list</B><Br>In addition to the user hotlist, Opera has a 
system hot list. This hot list can be managed by the
system administrators and include items that are useful for all users. This is another 
unique
feature of Opera.

as a parameter in addition to up to 10 addresses

without
destroying their own.
