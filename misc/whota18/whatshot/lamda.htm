Lambda is a 3D space combat game like X-Wing and Wing Commander with it 
currently in the early stages of development.
<br>

align=right>It'll 
feature texture mapped Lambert shaded polygon objects with Gouraud shaded laser 
bolts and translucent mathematically generated bitmap explosions and flames for 
rockets and missiles.  It will also have the interleaving of objects to allow flight 
through the structures of capital ships.  It should have some really good special 
effects.

At the moment the Developer is looking for 3D graphicians and a early preview of 
the engine is downloadable from their web site.
