<CENTER><H2>Aminet Not Deleted</H2></CENTER>
<P>
January 15, 1998 - Amiga users from around the world tonight gasped
in shock as they read a <A
HREF="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/pub/README">message</a> posted on the
Washington University (in St. Louis, MO) FTP site, the primary host of
the Aminet archive. The location where the primary Aminet archive is
usually stored is now reported as "not found" by the server and this
message can be found in the /pub/ directory of wustl:

<center>
<P><dir>
<TABLE CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=4 BGCOLOR="#D8D8D8" 
WIDTH="75%" BORDER=1>
<TR><TD>
Due to extensive and repeated abuse, the public files section of wuarchive
has been removed.  This also means that we are no longer accepting software
submissions.  We do, however, mirror several large platform-specific
archives.  If you are looking to distribute your software, you might
consider uploading your files to one of these other large archives.

<P>Uploads to the following sites will be mirrored to wuarchive in less than a
day:

garbo.uwasa.fi (DOS files, mirrored in /systems/ibmpc/garbo.uwasa.fi)<br>
ftp.winsite.com (windows files, mirrored in /systems/ibmpc/win[3,95,nt])<br>
info-mac.org (Macintosh files, mirrored in /systems/mac/info-mac)


<P>Please visit our main page at <A 
HREF="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/">http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/</A> to find 
other
great software.

<P>Thank you for visiting wuarchive.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</dir>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<P>Most of the people who were disturbed by that posting failed to notice
the date stamp of the file: November 16, 1997. It was an old post announcing the
deletion of files from wustl's /pub/ FTP directories--not Aminet.

<P>Aminet administrator Urban Mueller reported to CUCUG that the
problem is yet another in a long line of hard disk errors suffered at
the midwestern US university and that repairs were being made.
According to Mueller, the primary Aminet archive will be back online
within a few days and there is no need to panic.
<P>
<CENTER><H2>Aminet Being Restored</H2></CENTER>
<P>
January 19, 1998 - According to Urban Mueller, Administrator of
Aminet, the complete RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Drives) at
Washington University was lost due to "human error". Mueller confirmed
an earlier posting on the Amiga Web Directory which indicated that a
complete tape backup was available and was in process. The restore
from tape is currently estimated to take another two days to complete.
In the meantime files may still be downloaded from the
long list of Aminet mirrors located throughout the world. A list of these may be 
found at
<A 
HREF="http://www.cucug.org/aminet.html">http://www.cucug.org/aminet.html</A
> .

<P>Mueller also indicated that there are plans to make the main Aminet
site independent from Washintong University's "wuarchive" and that a
network alias would point to an alternate site in the event that the
primary site goes down again.

<P>Aminet is one of the world's largest file collections for any
computer and exclusively features Amiga-oriented software and other
materials.

<CENTER><H2>New POV Raytracer</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="images/pov.gif" alt="POV" WIDTH="340" HEIGHT="125">
</CENTER>
<p>
<font size="+2">P</font>ersistence of Vision, the multi-platform public domain 
rendering software,
has been updated. Persistence of Vision is a public domain raytracing program for
several platforms, including the Amiga. Joel Newkirk, one of the Amiga 
programmers,
has released the latest incarnation, version 3.02. What Persistence of Vision lacks
is a GUI: you have to stage your 3D scene by hand, although several helpful 
examples
are included and if you're good with graph paper, it's a manageable task.
<p>
<font size="+2">W</font>hat POV has in abundance are algorithmic textures 
to make your objects
visually appealing. With so many authors working on the project, they've amassed 
quite
a lot, to rival the included Imagine textures. Newkirk also promises support for the
Phase5 PowerUP cards in the near future, allowing much faster rendering times. 
There
are presently versions available for all Amigas, even those without FPU units.

<CENTER><H2>Titan Computers News</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/titan.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>
Titan Computers have released their third Amiga game.  It is the jump & run,
Sword.  I'm sure you have heard of it and may have even played the demo of it
that was released so I won't go into detail about the game.  It should be
available from Epic Marketing, who are the distributers of Titan products in the
Uk.<P>

Titans next Amiga release will be Evils Doom, this is a special edition of the
game that was released as Shareware last year.  It will be released on CD and
will give all the people that couldn't get hold of it before, a chance to see
what an excellent game it is.<P>

Titan also have a few other games coming out way.  The first of these is Claws
of the Devil.  This game features a Tomb-Raider style engine with an adventure
part.  It will be released on CD only and will require an 040/PPC, AGA or GFX
Card, 8MB Fast RAM, Hard-disk and a CD-ROM drive.  The second game is Total
Combustion, again this will be a CD only release.  It is a Car-Wars game that is
similar to Carmagedon.  This will also require an 040/PPC, AGA or GFX Card, 8Mb
Fast RAM, a hard-disk and a CD-ROM drive.<P>

I hope to bring you more news on these games very soon.
