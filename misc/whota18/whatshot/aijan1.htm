<b>January 09, 1998</b>

<P><b>From: Amiga, Inc.</b>

<P>The Amiga community has grown stronger and more unified over the past
few months. This is in large part due to the efforts of special users
that recognize the benefits of cooperation and activism on the part of
the Amiga and its community.

<P>One example of this hard work and determination is what created the
User Group Network (<A 
HREF="http://www.amiga.org/usergroups/">http://www.amiga.org/usergroups/</A>). This Network,
organized and maintained by the North Alabama Society of Amiga Users
(NASAU), is a tool to reach as many users as possible. The average
Amiga User does not necessarily have the luxury of the Internet, or
even a magazine subscription. User groups have always been a place
where friends meet and help each other.

<P>Amiga, Inc. hopes to increase the enrollment of existing Groups. The
UGN will offer up-to-date information, special pricing for hardware
and software and even contests. Enrollment in the UGN will afford
special benefits to user groups and their members.

<P>I would like to recognize one user group in particular: The
Champaign-Urbana Computer User Group (CUCUG), the hosts of The Amiga
Web Directory (<A 
HREF="http://www.cucug.org/aminew.html">http://www.cucug.org/aminew.html</A>). Since I have been on
the Net, I have had my browser open to the CUCUG "New Links"
(<A 
HREF="http://www.cucug.org/aminew.html">http://www.cucug.org/aminew.html</A>) page as my default page to find out
the latest news and Amiga happenings. I am not alone! Because of this,
we have expanded on the idea of the User Group Network. All new
information will be released to CUCUG for immediate broadcast on the
Internet and simultaneously to the UGN for dissemination among all the
participating user groups.

<P>Wayne Hunt will direct all information for posting to the User Group
Network. The UGN is a fabulous way for us to reach all users, whether
they are fortunate enough to be connected to the Internet or not and
we need to support this.

<P>Kevin Hisel of CUCUG and others in the group have done an outstanding
job promoting the Amiga on the Internet! For this we want to see The
Amiga Web Directory continue to be the place for breaking news and
online information about the Amiga.

<P>By utilizing these two, reliable channels of information, Amiga, Inc.
hopes to reach all Amiga users, world wide with the latest news and
information.

<P>Great work everyone!
