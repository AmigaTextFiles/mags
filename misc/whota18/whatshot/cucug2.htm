January 25, 1998 - Many fans of the Amiga computer have been breathing a sigh
of relief as they discover that the primary site hosting the world's largest Amiga
file archive has come back online. Reports first started coming in about 36 hours 
ago that
access was slow but the <A HREF="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/~aminet/">Aminet 
web pages</a> were beginning to come back up. As of this evening,
normal access to all files seems to have achieved by the Aminet administration 
team, led
by Urban Mueller.

<P>Earlier postings to the <A
HREF="http://search.dejanews.com/rn_print.xp?search=word&svcclass=dncurrent&
maxhits=50&showsort=date&agesign=1&ageweight=3&days=30&group=comp.s
ys.amiga.misc">comp.sys.amiga.misc</a>
newsgroup cited a message from Washington University claiming that the
public files section of wuarchive (the place where Aminet is hosted)
had been removed. Apparently that message had been written regarding
another matter and was posted months ago and had no bearing on the situation 
with Aminet.

<P>Mueller has indicated that there are plans to make the main Aminet site 
independent from
Washington University and that a network alias would point to an alternate site
in the event that the primary site goes down again.
