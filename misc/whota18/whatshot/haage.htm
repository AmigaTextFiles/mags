Now Ready For Power PC Programming</H2></CENTER>

<FONT SIZE="6"><BR>
</B></FONT><I>Over the course
of the last year and a half we have been preparing our development system for 
PowerPC-programming. Now that StormPowerASM
is finished we can offer you all the necessary tools: StormC for PowerPC, 
StormPowerASM and WarpUP. This combination
provides the programmer with a total package for porting existing software to the 
new PowerPC based Amigas. The
process is simple, quick and efficient.<BR>
<BR>
Together with the visual GUI-editor, StormWizard and with StormC for p.OS; the 
Storm development system allows
you to easily create powerful program interfaces and to support the alternative p.OS 
operating system.<BR>
<BR>
Thus the Storm product line places the most modern development tools directly in 
the hand's of the programmer.
 It also offers great flexibility for supporting all possibilities for future Amiga 
development.<BR>

<FONT SIZE="4"><B>StormPowerASM for PowerPC</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
The latest member of the Storm family is StormPowerASM, a PowerPC-assembler for 
Amiga computers. It supports the
entire PowerPC instruction set and on top of that offers several hundred extended 
mnemonics that make programming
easier and greatly increase source code readability. It has outstanding macro-
abilities and the support of floating-point
expressions and -operators prove the high level of this new PowerPC programming 
system.<BR>
The documentation describes programming the PowerPC. A list of all macros and 
directives (featuring extensive descriptions)
is also part of the documentation, as well as detailed information on our hardware-
layer.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>StormC 3.0 for PowerPC</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
For some time now the PowerPC add-on for StormC has been available. This 
enables you to flexibly program the dual-processor
boards by phase5 and any future PowerPC-boards. With the extended hunk-format 
(EHF); mixed-binaries, fat-binaries,
and even PowerPC-native shared-libraries can be created. The task of porting 
already existing software is greatly
simplified by this. Investing in this powerful add-on will pay off in almost no time 
because it saves you a lot
of work.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>WarpUP for PowerPC<BR>
</B></FONT><BR>
There is one question software houses are currently asking themselves: does it pay 
to port a program to the PowerPC?
What makes the right decision easier is a software-interface to the hardware which 
enables PowerPC-software to
use future PowerPC-developments from Amiga Inc. or third parties  without having 
to modify the software. This is
exactly what WarpUP offers. Through the use of a so-called hardware-abstraction-
layer (HAL) WarpUP places a layer
between the hardware and the user-applications.  This layer enables PowerPC-
software<BR>
to function with any PowerPC-hardware. For every software house this is the starting 
gun into a new era of PowerPC-development
on the Amiga.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>StormC 3.0 now also for 68k 
AmigaOS</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
The most important feature of this version is the new project assistant which makes 
putting together a project
with all source code modules and libraries a matter of a few mouse clicks. The 
updated StormED is now able to manage
bookmarks and offers a better way to individually extend the syntax dictionary. In 
the debugger, the resource-tracking
has been improved and the disassembler now is faster, better and more Motorola 
compliant. The entire instruction
set and all addressing modes of the 68k CPUs are supported. This makes the 
debugging even of hand-written assembly
routines and ROM code much easier.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>StormWizard 2.2 for AmigaOS and 
p.OS</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
The new version of the visual GUI editor has been completely re-worked. Almost all 
objects are now displayed significantly
faster. On top of that a new compatibility mode ensures that interfaces created 
using StormWizard can be modified
by tools such as VisualPrefs. The fully developed functions of StormWizard 2.2 allow 
easy and quick creation of
complex interfaces which then can be used with AmigaOS and p.OS<BR>
