<P>
Well, there have been a number of articles on Doom 2 of recent, so here are all of 
them together in one place.
<p>
Here is a press release from Alive Mediasoft:-<P>

<HR WIDTH="200">

<UL>

Well you have all heard the rumurs flying around about DOOM and ourselves.
You also are more than aware of ID releasing DOOM's source code as free ware.
<P>
So now to make things clear about our relationship with DOOM.
<P>
<U><B>Background.</B></U><P>

We had been working on a Mac Emulator specifically designed for a particular
MAC game. We had completed the DOOM version along with the Phantasm 
version.
<P>
Now the DOOM & PHANTASM versions never saw the light of day because we 
wanted
to do all things right and legal. Therefor applying to Apple for the rights to
use a MAC ROM. Needless to say this hasn't been granted to date.<P>

<U><B>Now.</U></B><P>


ID software release Doom source code as freeware.<P>

Alive Mediasoft Ltd takes that source code in the form of ADOOM and tweeks it
up to make AMIGA DOOM.<P>

Yes there are versions on the www, but these are basic. <P>

Ours allows the following;<P>
<UL>
<LI>1. Playable on 030 - 060 full screen (the processor routines have been
re-writen)</LI>

<LI>2. CD32 Joypad compatible.</LI>

</UL><P>
Now before you e-mail me back and tell me that we can't sell it as it is
freeware.<P>

We know and this is what we are doing;<P>

<I><B>We are selling DOOM II CD at £19-99
With this we are giving the AMIGA DOOM Disk complete with installer, plus a
Manual.</I></B><P>

Each disk will be serial numbered so any one purchasing from us will be able
to recieve help on trouble shooting or game tips.<P>

I hope this answers any of your quieries.<P>

</UL>
<p>
I have received even more news regarding Alive Mediasoft and Doom 2.  It now
seems that they wil not be releasing the game in the immediate future.<P>

It would seem that they have received an email from the head of ID stating that
they are not allowed to sell an Amiga version of Doom.  I'm not going to port
the complete email here but it also goes on to say that Alive don't have a
licence to sell it and if they do, ID will vigorously defend its property
rights.  In other words I'd guess Alive would be sued.<P>

This email was received hot after the news was released.  Alive had tried to
contact ID for several months prior to this.  Alive have replied and are still
waiting on a reply from ID, until a reply saying it is ok (Which is un-likely)
is received, the release of Amiga Doom is will not be.<P>
Another update on the Doom 2 saga.  I'm sure you'll be glad to hear this will be
the final update on this game as Alive have officially decided to cancel release
of the game, below is the press release:-<P>

<B><UL>

We have TERMINATED this project and therefor will not be having anything else
to do with Doom.<P>

This is due to the following;<P>

1. Comunications from ID Software threatening us with a legal action
if we pursue this project. <P>

ID software are under the impresion that we are making an unlicensed PORT of
Doom.  This is not the case and we have never made this out to be so. But people
being people rumurs spread and a 'chinese whisper' effect occurs.<P>

2. Our intentions were for the good of the Amiga and its loyal users.
After several months of trying to contact ID Software with regard to obtaining a
license, without success. We intended selling the PC Version of Doom and
supplying free with it OUR version of ADOOM, along with installer and 
manual.<P>

We had several e-mails from people accusing us of ripping off the guy who
originally produced ADoom.<P>

This is not the case as the source code was freeware and we made a version
that was CD32 controler compatible and which made ADoom run faster on 030/040
than the version currently available on the Aminet.
(The Aminet version being supplied on the next issues of the UK Amiga 
mags.)<P>

We tried to give the Amiga public something they should have had years ago,
and we got nothing but bad vibes from both sides.<P>

</UL></B>

And thats it, we won't be seeing Doom 2 from Alive.<P>

Moving on from that Alive are still developing 'The Haunted', get ready to see the 
screenshots in an upcoming article.<P>
Hopefully, we may also see other projects from Alive in the future.  Stay tuned
for news on this.
