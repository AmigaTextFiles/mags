<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b>

<P>Attention: Amiga Product Makers, Dealers,
Distributors, Vendors and Developers

<P>I'm Harv Laser and I run an online service for Amiga Owners called
"<A HREF="http://www.amigazone.com/">AmigaZone</a>", which has been 
around since 1985.  (I've also been
writing as a freelancer for many Amiga-oriented magazines for many
years, in case my name sounds familiar).

<P>One of our AmigaZone message bases, available to our members to
read, is called "Press Releases."

<P>This message base is gated to the outside world via an email
address.

<P>What this means to you, is that you can email your Amiga-related
(ONLY PLEASE!) product announcement, press releases, show
announcements, and so on to this email address:

<DIR>                     <A HREF="mailto:list-pr@amigazone.com">list-
pr@amigazone.com</A></DIR>

<P>And that mail will be pumped right into the AmigaZone's Press
Releases message base for our membership to read.

<P>There is absolutely NO cost to you to do this.

<P>This is provided as a FREE service to the Amiga products companies.

<P>Unlike <A 
HREF="http://search.dejanews.com/rn_print.xp?search=word&svcclass=dncurrent&
maxhits=50&showsort=date&agesign=1&ageweight=3&days=30&group=comp.s
ys.amiga.announce">comp.sys.amiga.announce</A>, your press/product releases 
don't
have to be formatted in some restrictive structure - all I ask is
that you keep them less than 80 columns wide, and send ONLY PLAIN
ASCII TEXT.  No HTML. No embedded binaries.  No MIMEd or uuencoded
stuff.  And only English-language, please.  Otherwise, the format is
your own decision.

<P>If you choose to use that email address to which to send your
product press releases, again, PLEASE use it ONLY for Amiga-related
products, services, and shows.  PLEASE (although I'm sure none of
you would do something so ugly) do NOT spam it, add it to unrelated
mailing lists, or abuse it with unrelated junk.

<P>Send the same kind of announcements to that address that you would
send to Kevin Hisel, for posting in the <A HREF="../../../amiga.html">Amiga Web 
Directory</a> - but
send them to my list as PLAIN ASCII TEXT ONLY please.

<P>--<br>
If you would like to participate in the AmigaZone, and have your own
account, info is available at my web site: <A 
HREF="http://www.amigazone.com/">http://www.amigazone.com/</A>

<P>AmigaZone is a commercial service, and is hosted by CalWeb Internet
Services, and is available anywhere, worlwide, by simply telnetting
in or using our member's web interface.

<P>Thanks for your kind attention.

<P>Regards,<br>
