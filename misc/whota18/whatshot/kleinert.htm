Picture Manager professional V5 (english) released


<P>At the Computer '97 fair in Cologne the new version 5 of the highly awarded
(see press feedback section below) Picture Manager professional (PMPro) has
been presented to the public.

<P>The german language version already could be obtained there - now the
english version is available, too.

<P>Maybe you don't know what the whole program is about ?


<P><b>PMPro - the universal graphics desktop</b>

<P>PMPro is designed as a universal graphics tool
for administration, processing and conversion of
bitmapped graphics and IFF animation's. Since the
graphics or animation's are displayed as miniaturised
thumbnails on the screen, the user gains a complete
overview over all graphics files on his hard disks, CD-ROMs,
etc. and can directly access these via mouse clicks and
may also export these directly to any other program
like DPaint, PPaint, AdPro and so on.
Integrated 24 Bit image processing functionality and
intelligent image conversion into other file formats
complete the package.

<P>The following list shows the most important features:

<ul>
<li> Recursively scans directories and Hard Drives,
Bernoulli Drives, CD-ROMs, etc. for bitmap graphics
and IFF animation's.

<li> Recognises more than 25 graphics file formats (IFF, GIF, JPEG,
TIFF, MAC-Pict, BMP, PCX, TARGA, PCD, IFF-DEEP, SGI, SunRaster,
YUVN and more) as well as IFF animation's (OPT5, OPT7 and Opt8).  (*)

<li> Saves about 15 graphic file formats. Automatic
conversion of graphics in any other file format possible.         (*)

<li> Reads graphics of Kodak Photo CDs.

<li> Displays up to 80 thumbnails per screen page, depending
on selected screenmode.

<P><b>And here are the news of V5 in brief:</b>


<ul>

from a PictureManager catalog. So, now you can view PMPro catalogs
with any web browser, on any platform (MAC, Unix, Win95, WinNT ...).

<li> <b>Automatized Image Processing:</b>
When converting image collections, you now additionally are able to
let upto 5 image processing operators automatically be applied!

<li> <b>Conversion of Catalogs:</b> PMPro5 now also includes a tool to 
convert catalogs to different thumbnail
sizes or color depths. This way, for example a color catalog with 144x112
pixel can be changed into a grayscaled catalog with 120x96 pixel size.

<li> <b>GFX-Pages:</b> The function Extras/IFF-Pages has been extended by 
the function Extras/GFX-Pages.
Apart from many choices for layout settings, you now also freely can select the
graphics file format in which the overview pages will be saved.

When printing catalogs there are now many choices for page layout, beginning
from freely selectable row and column numbers upto various text options
and freely defineable bottom lines.

<li> <b>Preview for Image Processing:</b>

The Image Processing functionality of PMPro now allows a simple preview
before applying the correspoding image processing operator.

<li> <b>Increased speed and more improvements / Extended Load, Save and 
Image Processing
Modules</b>

<li> <b>PowerPC Support:</b>

Calculation-intensive loader and image processing routines have been redone
as omptimized PowerPC code. PPC boards after the PowerUp standard are 
automatically
recognized.
</ul>

<P>(*) the number of supported graphics file formats of course increased, too
 - we just listed the most important ones
