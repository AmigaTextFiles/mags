After all the rumours and all the signs that have been coming from ClickBOOM, 
they have finally announced their intentions to convert and publish Quake for the 
Amiga.
<br>

align=right>It was confirmed on the 5th of January with ClickBOOM announcing 
the News on their web site and are already taking pre-orders with Amiga Quake set 
to be released on the 1st of February.  You'll only have a short time to wait.
<br>
<br>
It's important Amiga Quake sales are high, if they are it will mean that ClickBOOM 
will able to gain licenses to convert any game Amiga Owners desire and PC 
publishers in turn will notice the Amiga but sales must be high. 
<br>
<br>
ClickBOOM will be providing full support to those who buy it and they have many 
more plans for Amiga Quake, we should hear about these soon.
<br>
<br>
Amiga Quake will be absolutely identical to the original pc version such as levels, 
enemies, weapons, options, keys, quality of the graphics, sounds but it'll have some 
additional options like full 16-bit gfx support, mouse freelook, misc. gfx settings, 
Amiga-style menus, locale support, ARexx support and more.  The most exciting 
feature to be included is that you will be able to play Amiga Quake over the 
Internet against PC, MAC or other Amiga players.  Another bonus is that any of the 
Quake add-ons you can download or buy will work on your Amiga.
