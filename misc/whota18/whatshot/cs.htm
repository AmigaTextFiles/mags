border=0>Caveman Species is a real-time strategy wargame set in prehistoric time, 
under development by newly formed Black Flag whose capabilities seem to be 
outstanding if they continue creating graphics like the ones seen here.  Black Flag 
aim to support the Amiga fully along with the next generation Amiga's in the 
future.
<br>
<br>
Black Flag's first game is Caveman Species, the story is based on small planet where 
intelligent lifeforms have emerged.  Out of this is formed four tribes each fighting 
for territories including the conquest of the entire three continents where life has 
spread.  Only the strongest will survive this evolutionary rage for power and 
destruction and so it's up to you to be the strongest or face defeat.
<br>
<br>
You'll have three different maps with over 90 territories to conquer and be able to 
build cities and control your armies in the battle field.  It will also have several 
degrees of evolution to help expand the environment and more.  The developers 
are considerating a two player mode with direct cable connection with the possibly 
of modem support too.

border=0>It'll feature full screen 256 colour hires in-game graphics with low 
resolution in battle sequences and tonnes of megabytes of pre-rendered 3D 
animations with incredible quality.  Hundreds of highly detailed character 
animations are planned with lots of digitized sound effects and music in full stereo 
to set the atmosphere.
<br>
<br>
Caveman Species will require an 020 processor or better with it needing 4MB Fast 
Ram and is CD-Rom only.  It should be released in Spring 1998 and I'll get you 
more info and screenshots when they come in.
