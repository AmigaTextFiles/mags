<P><b>About Infinite Frontiers</b>

<P>Infinite Frontiers was started as a small sci-fi group producing paper
fanzines several years ago, by Simon Plumbe. Currently in existance as
a non-profit making organisation, co-ordinated by Simon Plumbe
and Colin Gunn, Infinite Froniters exists to entertain and educate.

<P>1991 saw the launch of our first major sucess, The Final Frontier.
This Star Trek fanzine was a little different to most in that it was
on Amiga floppy disk. The mag featured not only text, but artwork from
Tobias Richter and eventually from Mark Platts & Gary Moffat plus
music from the likes of Bjorn Lynne and Allister Brimble. Infinite
Frontiers other Amiga based releases included the Holodeck series of
Star Trek slideshows (including the worlds first high density 1.76Mb
Amiga disk slideshow) , the Illusions series of sci-fi & fantasy
slideshows, and CD World.

<P>More recently, while we carry on developing the floppy based work we
have branched back out into paper-based 'zine publishing. Current
releases include, The Final Frontier Phase 2 (Star Trek), Visions
(general sci-fi & fantasy), The Continuing Voyages (Star Trek
fiction), and The Cybertronian Times (Transformers). Several other
titles are in development.

<P>The Amiga has gone hand in hand with Infinite Frontiers providing us
with the tools we have needed to create our productions. The Amiga is
absolutely vital to our paper publications (we use both Wordworth and
Final Writer for layout plus ProText, DPaint V, Personal Paint 7.1 and
other packages). The Amiga also played a very important part in the
convention for fans of Star Trek we held in Birmingham, England during
August of 1996.

<P>Amiga Energy is a way we hope to give something back. We have plans
for Amiga Energy and hope it will compliment the two current UK
produced Amiga magazines, and, we hope, come some way to fill the gaps
left by the cancellation of the Amiga magazines we have lost in the
last couple of years. As part of our thankyou, instead of just 1 disk
on the coverdisk version of the magazine (which will be the normal
situation), issue 1 will have covermounted our licenseware 2 disk
release, Holodeck 10.

<P>Thank you for your attention,

<P>Sven Harvey (co-editor, Amiga Energy)
