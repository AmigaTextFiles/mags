Skillo Interactive have a few games in development but Martian Tales is a game 
that perculiarity stands out.  Martian Tales is a Warcraft II inspired strategy game 
and you will be able to see that it has greatly progressed since it was last covered.

align=right border=0>A war has broke out between the Greys and the Smeglings 
who battle over control of fungus growths and lichen forests that sustain them.  The 
Greys have the remains of their advanced technology to gain the upper hand in war 
but it is now becoming worn out and dangerous to use with the Smeglings having 
low technology base but their alchemists and adventurers constantly come up with 
new inventions that sometimes even work.  It is up to you to take control over one 
of these groups.  Other creatures to watch out for include huge monsters, Snow-
Beasts, Targa Eels, demons from the air and more are planned.

It will feature intelligence (eg. fear, bravery, boredom, hatred), the ability to mine 
the three substances found on Mars (Fungus, Lichen +  Stone).  It'll also have 
special effects such as light effects for explosions, lichen can go on fire, water can 
become polluted and foot prints can be left by the troops.  Water and Air based 
troops are planned.
