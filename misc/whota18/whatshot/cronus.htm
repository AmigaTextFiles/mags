Dear Amiga User,

<P>This message is to inform you of some changes at <A 
HREF="http://www.ninemoons.com/">Cronus</a> (formerly Amiga Library
Services) and to give you first opportunity at some really great deals on Amiga
CD-ROMs.

<P>In early 1986 I founded Amiga Library Services to distribute Amiga software 
on floppy
disk (AKA "Fish Disks") and then many years later began producing CD-ROM 
distributions
of Amiga software.  At the time of Commodore's bankruptcy, Amiga Library 
Services was a
small but growing company that not only produced our own products, but 
imported many
products from overseas and resold them to both end users and dealers.

<P>Of course many things have happened since then, and we recently find 
ourselves in the
position of not having sufficient ongoing sales to really justify remaining in the
Amiga marketplace at this time.  So a couple months ago, we made the rather 
painful
decision that Cronus would stop reselling Amiga products, and with the exception 
of
future AmigaOS versions of Geek Gadgets, stop producing our own Amiga products.  
Of
course this is not an irreversible decision.  If for some reason in the future it makes
sense to reenter the marketplace we will certainly do so.  This is not a loss of faith
in the Amiga itself, but purely a business decision based on the "bottom line".

<P>So we now find ourselves in possession of several thousand CD-ROMs that we 
would like
to liquidate at below our original cost.  Below you will find a complete list of the
titles and quantity of each that we have in stock.  This is a great opportunity for
individuals, user groups, and dealers to obtain these products at an unbeatable 
price.

<P>You are receiving this mail because you are on one of the Amiga related 
mailing lists
that Cronus supports as a service to the Amiga community.  We have full intention 
to
continue providing this service. As a member of one of our mailing lists, you are 
the
first to know about this liquidation sale.  In a few days we will post an 
announcement
on the Amiga forsale group and change our web site so that the rest of the Amiga
community knows about this sale.

<P><hr>

<P>The rules of this liquidation sale are simple:

<ol>
<li> First come, first served.  Orders will be processed as they are received.  Since
quantities vary, obviously we can't guarantee availability of any particular title.  If
for some reason we are out of stock on a particular title you have ordered, we will
substitute a different title of equal value.  You can specify "alternate selections" if
you wish.

<li> All sales are final.  There will be no refunds or exchanges.

<li> The minimum purchase is $10, not including shipping and handling.

<li> Domestic (USA) shipping will be via UPS, Airborne, or US Priority mail.  
Shipping
to Canada and overseas destinations will be via small packet airmail.  Cronus 
STRONGLY
suggests shipping via a tracked shipping method such as UPS or Airborne to avoid
problems with lost shipments.  You should specify your prefered shipping method 
at time
of order.

<li> Shipping charges will be calculated and added to your order based upon 
current UPS,
Airborne, or US Postal Service rates, plus a small amount to cover packaging and
handling (typically $1-$2).  As an example, total shipping and handling charges for 
1
to 4 CD's via UPS ground would normally be about $5.  Since 4 CD's are about 1 
lb, each
additional quantity of 4 CDs would normally add about $1 to the shipping cost.

<li> Prices are non-negotiable unless you are interested in at least fifty or more 
CD's
of a given title.  In that case, contact me directly for pricing.

<li> For payment we accept VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Discover/Novus, 
money
orders (in US funds) or cashier's checks.  No personal checks will be accepted.

<li> Orders placed via email should go to "<A 
HREF="mailto:orders@ninemoons.com">orders@ninemoons.com</A>".  If for 
some reason
you are unable to get email through to ninemoons.com, then send it to me 
personally at
"<A HREF="mailto:fnf@cygnus.com">fnf@cygnus.com</A>".
</ol>
<P>Orders placed via paper mail should go to:
