<B><FONT SIZE="6">Q</FONT>uiet Please Tennis is (Funnily enough) a 
Tennis game
from a group called the Spooky Fellows. You may have heard of the game before 
as
initial development started way back in 1996, however, due to problems,
programming was stopped. Things have now been sorted out though and the game 
is
well on it's way.</B><P>

The Spooky Follows is an Italian group that was born in the demo scene in its
active days.  They were formally part of a group called RAM JAM who made quite
a name for themselves in the scene back then.  However, there were internal
problems and a number of them left RAM JAM and formed the Spooky 
Fellows.<P>

Anyway, back to the game.  The Amiga has been devoid of tennis games for quite 
a
while now.  The only ones that spring to mind are Pro Tennis Tour & Advantage
Tennis, other then this, there has been nothing special.  Hopefully Quiet Please
Tennis will change this.<P>

The game is being billed as a simulation and a highly arcade game, covering
nearly all the important aspects of normal tennis as well as some other that you
won't find in other tennis games.  This includes things such as being able to
query a point with the umpire if the call is doubtfull.  The game will be based
around the ATP tour, with the player being able to partisipate in either singles
or doubles matches.<P>

The game will be played via a TV style above and behind view in 128 colours. 
The players themselves will each be in 32 colours and will be animated with over
200 frames.  There will a number of players in the game that will all have looks
inspired by the top players in the game today.  Each player will have there own
skills (backhand forehand, speed etc) as well as if they are left/right
handed.<P>

To add to the feel of the game, there will be animated referees, linesman,
ballboys which will all play there role in the game.  There will also be a
number of different surfaces available to play on all with different
characteristics (ie. grass will make the game faster and clay slower).<P>

The sound has not been forgotten either as there will be wealth of sound effects
included in the game.  Digitised effects and speech will not only accompany
important parts of the game (points, games being won) but also things like the
ball hitting the top of the net and changing direction or a player missing an
easy shot.<P>

The game is set for release for AGA Amigas later in the year.<P>

Currently the game doesn't have a publisher, anyone interested please Email the
