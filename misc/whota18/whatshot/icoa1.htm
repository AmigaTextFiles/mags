<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b>


<P>The Temporary Steering Committee takes great pleasure in announcing the
official formation of the <A 
HREF="http://www.netreach.net/~fleecy/icoa/">Industry Council for Open 
Amiga</a> (ICOA).  The
ICOA is a non-profit organization registered with the state of South
Dakota in the United States, chartered for operations worldwide. We
wish to take this opportunity to thank Amiga Incorporated for their
invaluable legal and financial assistance
in making this possible and look forward to working closely with them
to bring the pleasure of using Amiga technology to millions of
consumers around the globe.

<P>There are still some administrative matters to be completed before the
ICOA is fully in operation. We are committed to our
our promise of a fully functional ICOA as soon as possible; therefore,
within the next few days, a membership form will be available  on the
ICOA web site to allow individual developers and development companies
to submit membership applications.  These initial applications will be
processed and assessed by the TSC (acting as a temporary membership
committee) according to our Bylaws.  No membership dues will be
required until the financial foundation of the ICOA is in place. At
that time all members will be given the option of paying their dues or
leaving the ICOA.

<P>We feel that this method will allow potential members to join and
experience membership in the ICOA without the initial financial
commitment. Of  course, until dues are assesed, work on the ICOA-net
and some services will be delayed.

<P>We expect to begin processing membership applications by the February
1st. As soon the ICOA has 100 members, elections for the Steering
Committee will begin.  The elections will be run by the Election
Working Group Manager, who will serve as the Election Officer for the
first elections.  The elections will consist of a two week nomination
period, a two week campaign period for the nominees who accept their
nominations and are placed on the ballot, followed by an election
period lasting seven days. Our goal is to have a new Steering Committee
by the St Louis Amiga show.

<P>The method for selecting the user representative is being worked on and
we hope to have our user representative in place by the time the dev
elopers representatives are elected.

<P>Please check the <A HREF="http://www.netreach.net/~fleecy/icoa/">ICOA 
web site</a> every few days for the membership form.
