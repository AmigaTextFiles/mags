<b> Bold Move To Harness Creative Power Of Thousands Of
Internet Developers; Company Makes Netscape
Navigator And Communicator 4.0 Immediately Free For All
Users, Seeding Market For Enterprise And Netcenter
Businesses
</b>

<P>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (January 22, 1998) -- Netscape Communications
Corporation (NASDAQ: NSCP) today announced bold plans to make the
source code for the next generation of its highly popular Netscape
Communicator client software available for free licensing on the
Internet. The company plans to post the source code beginning with the
first Netscape Communicator 5.0 developer release, expected by the end
of the first quarter of 1998. This aggressive move will enable
Netscape to harness the creative power of thousands of programmers on
the Internet by incorporating their best enhancements into future
versions of Netscape's software. This strategy is designed to
accelerate development and free distribution by Netscape of future
high-quality versions of Netscape Communicator to business customers
and individuals, further seeding the market for Netscape's enterprise
solutions and Netcenter business. <P>

In addition, the company is making its currently available Netscape
Navigator and Communicator Standard Edition 4.0 software products
immediately free for all users. With this action, Netscape makes it
easier than ever for individuals at home, at school or at work to
choose the world's most popular Internet client software as their
preferred interface to the Internet. <P>

"The time is right for us to take the bold action of making our client
free - and we are going even further by committing to post the source
code for free for Communicator 5.0," said Jim Barksdale, Netscape's
president and chief executive officer. "By giving away the source code
for future versions, we can ignite the creative energies of the entire
Net community and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the
browser market. Our customers can benefit from world-class technology
advancements; the development community gains access to a whole new
market opportunity; and Netscape's core businesses benefit from the
proliferation of the market-leading client software." <P>

Netscape plans to make Netscape Communicator 5.0 source code available
for modification and redistribution beginning later this quarter with
the first developer release of the product. The company will handle
free source distribution with a license which allows source code
modification and redistribution and provides for free availability of
source code versions, building on the heritage of the GNU Public
License (GPL), familiar to developers on the Net. Netscape intends to
create a special Web site service where all interested parties can
download the source code, post their enhancements, take part in
newsgroup discussions, and obtain and share Communicator-related
information with others in the Internet community. Netscape will also
continue to develop new technologies and offer periodic certified,
high-quality, supported releases of its Netscape Communicator and
Navigator products, incorporating some of the best features created by
this dynamic community. <P>

The ubiquity of Netscape's client software facilitates Netscape's
strategy of linking millions of individuals to businesses. Today's
announcements will help to further proliferate Netscape's
award-winning client software which today has an installed base of
more than 68 million, providing a ready market for businesses using
Netscape's Networked Enterprise software solutions and Netscape
Netcenter services. Netscape's research indicates that in the
education market where Netscape's products are free, the Netscape
client software commands approximately 90 percent share, indicating
that users tend to choose Netscape when the choice is freely
available. Making its browser software free also will enable Netscape
to continue to drive Internet standards, maximize the number of users
on the Internet, and expand the third-party community of companies and
products that take advantage of the Netscape software platform. <P>

Netscape has successfully shifted its business over the past year
toward enterprise software sales and to revenues from its Web site
business, and away from standalone client revenues. In the third
quarter of 1997, standalone client revenues represented approximately
18 percent of Netscape's revenue, with the rest coming from enterprise
software, services and the Web site. Preliminary results for the
fourth quarter of 1997, which Netscape announced January 5, show
standalone client revenues decreased to approximately 13 percent in
the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 1996 by comparison,
standalone client revenue represented approximately 45 percent of
Netscape's revenue. <P>

In conjunction with its free client, Netscape separately announced
today that it is launching a host of enhanced products and services
that leverage its free client software to make it easy for enterprise
and individual customers to adopt Netscape solutions. The new products
and services reinforce Netscape's strategy of leveraging market
penetration of its popular client software and its busy Internet site
to seed further sales of Netscape software solutions in the home and
business markets. The new products and services include enhanced
subscription and support packages, an investment protection program
for Netscape Communicator users, new reduced pricing on Netscape's
retail and enterprise client products, new Premium Services on its
Netscape Netcenter online service and Netscape SuiteSpot server
software upgrades featuring Netscape client software. <P>

In addition, the company separately announced the launch of an
aggressive new software distribution program called "Unlimited
Distribution" to broadly distribute its market-leading Internet client
software for free. Unlimited Distribution enables Original Equipment
Manufacturers (OEMs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
telecommunications companies, Web content providers, publishers and
software developers to download and redistribute Netscape Communicator
and Netscape Navigator easily with "no strings attached." In addition,
beginning immediately, individual users can download Netscape
Communicator or Navigator for free, register for Netscape Netcenter
and, beginning tomorrow, enter the Choose Netscape Sweepstakes to win
exciting travel-related prizes including a grand prize of two
all-inclusive, seven-night tropical resort vacations. <P>

Individuals can download a free copy of Netscape Communicator client
software or the Netscape Navigator browser from the Netscape home page
at <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com">http://home.netscape.com</A>, or
by clicking on any of the thousands of "Netscape Now" buttons on the
Internet. Netscape Communicator Professional Edition, which adds
features for enterprise customers, will be available for US$29. <P>
