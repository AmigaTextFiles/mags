<B>Quake Delayed.</B><P>

Amiga Quake has been delayed slightly and it now set for release later in the
month of February, as yet, and exact date has not been given.<P>

It would seem that the game has been pretty much finished since the end of
December, ClickBOOM just need a little more time to iron out some of the bugs
and quirks that the game has.  One particular thing that I hear they are paying
attention to is making sure that all of the Quake add-ons work perfectly on the
Amiga version.<P>

<B>Quakeworld.</B><P>

Clickboom have also announed that ID have given the go-ahead to release
Quakeworld for the Amiga.  Quakeworld is a multi-player version of Quake
designed for high latency TCP/IP connections.  Quake supports multi-player
support but games can lag badly unless you have a very high-speed connection. 
Quakeworld rectifies this and allows people woth a slower connections to enjoy
the fun.<P>

Quakeworld for the Amiga will be started as soon as Quake is finished and as
with the original Quakeworld release it will be provided free of charge to Quake
owners and won't be part of the actual Quake release.  Looks out for more news
on this soon.<P>
