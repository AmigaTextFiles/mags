Hi,
<p>
The start of a new year, and this first month has been suprisingly packed with some 
big really Amiga News stories.  You may have noticed that not all the articles in the 
<A HREF="news.htm">News</A> section are in the Latest News section on the 
<A HREF="main.htm">Main Index</A>, and this is due to the shear of volume 
of news articles that are in this issue.  This issue's editorial and this issue of What's 
Hot On The Amiga Magazine, concentrates on the future of the Amiga, with the 
most important article in this issue being <A HREF="cpu.htm">Amiga, Inc. 
Announces The Future CPU For The Amiga</A>, and no doubt the<A 
HREF="alpha.htm">Alpha Project</A> article will also be of interest as well.  As 
usual, there are plenty of articles on the Amiga games front, with Quake, Amiga 
Doom and Doom 2, making up a large proportion of the Amiga games news and 
also as with every issue of whota over the last couple of months, there is some 
more news on Foundation.  Also, thanks to e-mail that I received a couple of weeks 
ago from Chuck Patterson, who maintains the <A 
HREF="http://www.azstarnet.com/~midian/amigaring.html">Amiga Ring</A>, 
and I would like to say that What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine will support along 
with my other web pages, the Amiga Ring, by becoming members and displaying 
one of the Amiga Ring images, and also an article is present in this issue and I 
would to say that you're an Amiga owner maintaining a web site and you're not a 
member of the Amiga Ring, become a member as soon as you can and support the 
Amiga.
<p>
But, also this month's news has been dogged with articles on the recent problems 
with the Aminet, which seems to be becoming a common problem of the past few 
months, but for you web surfers out there, the arrival of AWeb 3.1, the 
first Amiga web browser to come out with JavaScript will be of interest, along with 
the announcement of <A HREF="netscape.htm">Netscape Announcing Plans To 
Make Next-Generation Communicator Source Code Available Free On The Net</A> 
and <A HREF="opera.htm">Opera</A>, a new platform independent web 
browser from Opera Software, who are prepared to do an Amiga version, if there is 
enough interest in one.  But, I've heard that Finale Web Cruiser, should be out 
soon along with Voyager NG v3.0, but regarding IBrowse, I can't be sure as I've 
heard anything for months on end.  Expect also to see Merapi and MOca, the first 
two Amiga Java Virtual Machines to appear soon, but again, I don't have an exact 
idea of when they'll be out.   
<p>
This issue's exclusive articles are on <A HREF="alpha.htm">Alpha Project</A>, 
<A HREF="amigaring.htm">AmigaRing</A>, <A 
HREF="amigadoom.htm">Amiga Doom</A>, <A 
HREF="explorer2260.htm">Explorer2260 - Latest Screenshots</A>, <A 
HREF="jeff.htm">What Jeff Schindler of Amiga Inc Revealed At 
The Computer 97 Show</A>, <A HREF="mippc.htm">Miami PPC</A>, <A 
HREF="opera.htm">Opera</A>, <A HREF="stfax.htm">STFax 3.0 
Professional</A> and <A HREF="warpup.htm">WarpUP Latest</A>.
<p>
The promised article on PCI slots for the Amiga which was supposed to be in this 
issue and the issue before will hopefully turn up in the next issue. 
<p>
What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine can still be found on the web, at: <p> <A 
HREF="http://www.sonic.net/~alanwall/whota/index.html">http://www.sonic.net/~al
anwall/whota/index.html</A>. 
<p>
Now this month's, Site Of The Month is <A 
HREF="http://homepage.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/rc5/">The Amiga 
RC5 Team Effort</A>, which has been mentioned in a number of previous articles 
in What's Hot.  The site is well worth a look to keep up with all the latest.  With 
the advent of a PowerPC Client, the Amiga RC5 Team Effort's rating can only go 
up.  At the moment, they are currently hanging around 7th position and 15th 
position in the DES III challenge, so if you haven't given them your support, do so 
now. 
<P>
The Links section has been cleaned up and so check out <A 
HREF="links.htm">Links</A> for the latest additions to my Links Section.

uk</A>
<P>

appreciated along with images for image links as I'd like to fill in some of the 
spaces on some of the pages, so just e-mail them to me at:
