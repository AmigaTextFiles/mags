<P>January 26, 1998 - <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/">CUCUG</a> is very

user group raffle.

<P>"We are very excited to be able to give away ten free copies of what
is probably the most popular title available on the Amiga at this
time," said Kevin Hisel, CUCUG's web master.

<P>The ten copies of the game will be awarded randomly to current CUCUG
Amiga members--five on February 19th and the remaining five on March
19th. You must be a paid member of CUCUG on those dates to win.

other Amiga companies which have supported our membership with their
generous donations."
