Alive MediaSoft are a relatively new publisher but they have already left their mark 
in the Amiga Games Market with the release of Blade and with them signing up 
Goblin Tanks and Gilbert Goodmate.
<br>
<br>
But the Haunted, a spook adventure has been under development for two years 
now and they are in no rush to release it for the makers Jennie and Steven Flowers 
along with musician Darryl Sloan want to make this title Alive MediaSoft's very best 
in every aspect.

They have replaced every single picture and animation in Haunted with a high-res 
laced version which can be seen in this News article.  As I have said early they have 
been carefully looking at every aspect especially with gameplay for example as you 
progress through the game and solve puzzles you come across you will be awarded 
with Progress points.  This gives you a brief idea on how well you are doing.  They 
have helped to improve the controls by creating a brand new border and option 
panel, designed to give superior graphics but mainly to give the player easier 
control over moving around and examing objects.  The inventory selection has been 
overhauled for you will view your object in full real-time rendered animations and 
gain some further knowledge by listening to the game-keepers descriptions and 
occasional clues.

But a game of this nature being a spooky adventure requires atmosphere and this is 
down to new member of the team, Darryl Sloan but already I've been told that he 
has contributed to some incredible spooky music.  Speech is another element which 
will be in Haunted for when you open a book you will hear yourself read the pages 
of the book and this will also be used when for example you pick up a rusty piece 
of metal for the Gamekeeper informs you "it looks like an old key!".

Alive MediaSoft realise that many people have been waiting for Haunted and wish 
to apologise but I believe it's worth waiting for no matter how long it takes.  The 
effort by these three individuals has been tremendous and they gave me a close 
insight into the changing shape of this title, it really shows me their determination 
and dedication.
