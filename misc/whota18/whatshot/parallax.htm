<b>January 24, 1998</b>

<P>Ann Arbor, MI - <A HREF="http://www.pxsoftware.com/">Parallax
Software</a>, developer of the smash hits <i>Descent, Descent II</i>, and
<i>Descent Maximum</i> today announced the release of the Descent source 
code
to the public domain. The source code will be made available as a free
download via the Descent Developers Resource (<A 
HREF="http://www.ladder.org/ddr/">http://www.ladder.org/ddr/</A>)
website this Saturday.

<P>When asked about the decision to release the source code, Parallax founder 
and
President Mike Kulas had this to say, "We figured a lot of people aspiring to work 
in
the game industry would like to see production quality code. There are two reasons 
for
this. One, you can learn a lot by looking at working code. Two, people will see that
you can write a decent game without writing beautiful code."

<P>Kevin Bentley, maintainer of the Descent Developer Resources and author of 
Kahn, has
agreed to support this code base through his website at www.ladder.org/ddr. 
Questions
or comments concerning the code may be directed to the previous website. Please 
do not
contact Parallax Software, its employees or its affiliates.

<P>Parallax Software Corporation (www.pxsoftware.com) was founded in 1993. 
Descent (for PC
and Mac) was released in 1995. Descent (for Playstation), Descent II (for PC & Mac), 
and
Descent Maximum (for Playstation) were released in 1996.
