System</H2></CENTER>

<b>PRESS RELEASE</b><br>
Date: January 21, 1998

<P>We are pleased to announce that <A 
HREF="http://www.paxtron.com/">Paxtron Corporation</a>  has been granted
exclusive distribution rights in North America under licensing from Amiga
International through Access Information Systems.  Access is a newly
licensed Amiga 1200 cloned motherboard specifically designed for kisoks and
is 100% Amiga compatible.

<P><hr width="75%">

<P>The Access computer is a low cost Corporate Multimedia delivery platform
(kiosks, advertising displays, etc.) based on the Amiga Chip Set and
Operating System.  In addition to the standard Amiga specification, the
Access has connectivity options, CD-ROM and floppy disk drive.  The design
is flexible so that a range of motherboards can be built which have 90%
common parts, mount in the same case, can be flexibly manufactured using
computer controlled production equipment and therefore allow rapid delivery
of small batches at an economical price.

<P>The motherboard, when fitted with its mounting frame and floppy disk drive,
fits into a standard 5 1/4" drive bay.  The mounting method is extremely
flexible and allows us to mount the motherboard in a wide range of cases,
even in a standard PC case (although its depth of 297mm does cause problems
with some bays).  The options this provides extends from its "normal"
package with a CD-ROM to a compact 8 unit tower case for major installations.

<P>The Access kiosk system will primarily be used for the following:

<ul>
<li> Education/Interactive training - CD-ROM or Ethernet network delivery.

<li> Public Displays - Museums, public buildings, attractions, advertising.

<li> Internet access - Integrates a modem & hard disk in half height case.

<li> Public kiosks - Interactive product selection and vending control.
</ul>
