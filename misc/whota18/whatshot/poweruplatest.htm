The following is from Phase5's web site and gives on their plans with their new 
PowerPC accelerator cards.
<p>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE=+1>Multiprocessing<BR>
</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>Multiprocessing capability is a main design goal of the PowerUp product
line and the PowerUp system software. We are convinced, that every advanced
and progressive OS development has to incorporate multiprocessing, since
this is a main basic for the expandibility of future systems. This was the
reason to orient our development mainly on multiprocessing. We consider
an inadequate or even missing support of multiprocessing as a major 
restriction.</P>

<P>Already the current PowerUp boards are using both CPUs featuring parallel
multiprocessing. Although both CPUs dynamically share the same bus, a sufficient
memory access is guaranteed for both, because the peak memory bandwidth is
approx 200 MB/sec. Dynamic bus allocation means, that to both CPUs alternating
four burst cycles access are granted if they request continuous memory access;
if one CPU requires less or even no memory access, the other CPU gets more
bus cycles granted. Logic analyser traces show, that both CPUs even on heavy
load, very often release the bus, which enables other bus masters like SCSI
DMA or additional CPUs to use the bus. A Mandelbrot calculation or a MPEG
decode for example requires the PPC to read a certain amount of data using
burst accesses, and subsequently during the calculation the bus is released.
During this period the bus is available to the 68k CPU, which can do other
tasks such as OS functions, preparing data for the next PPC task or interpret
data returned from the PPC. By using structured programming styles like
documented in our <B>guidelines</B>, the application
can take optimal advantage of both CPUs performance and the available memory
bandwidth with full support of our hardware.</P>

<P>To get most out of a multiprocessing hardware, the software needs to
be adapted to the hardware. By the features of our PowerUp system software
this adaption is included as much as possible in the system libraries and
requires only minor changes to current application designs. By use of our
multiprocessing prepared message system it is possible to incorporate not
only additional PPC processors but also special GL-3D CPUs or DSPs or even
have a cluster of networked systems working simultaneously on a certain
task. Applications that use our PowerUp system software are prepared to
use these possibilities without or at least only minor changes. This can
be the base for creative development of hardware and software and we hope
that - even in these times of mass computing and nearly monopolistic 
standardization
of the technologies - this opens possibilities for creative developers to
built up fascinating solutions and products for and with the Amiga far beyond
today's limitations.</P>

<P>We consider the sometimes arousing proposal that future Amigas will remain
single processor systems as not progressive and leading only to intermediate
solutions. All in all it is  just speculation. Even if the basic
machine will stay a single CPU system, there will be third party vendors
like phase 5 offering multi processor extensions for the Amiga.</P>

<P>Indeed the conceptual design for a multi processor PowerUp system, which
will be delivered in 1998, is already done. This PowerUp System will have
one 68040 or 68060 CPU and up to four PPC604e CPUs at 200-400 MHz and 
feature
128 bit wide SDRAM. Equipped with four PPC604e/300 MHz this system will
retail for approx. USD 3,500 to 4,000 and reach a floating point performance
of 40-50 SpecFP95, which especially will boost up 3D applications to absolute
workstation level. Every application developed under PowerUp and fulfilling
our guidelines will be able to immediately take advantage of this multiprocessor
accelerator board. We expect this board to be delivered Summer 1998 and
have already established contacts to leading vendors of 3D software who
are very interested in such an solution.</P>

<P>In addition to our own product concepts, which will bring overwhelming
performance to the Amiga, we are in contact to various processor manufacturers
and have under NDA restrictions access to informations about future processor
concepts. Because of these informations, we see clearly the necessarity
to make the future software generation multiprocessing prepared.
<BR>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE=+1>Hardware 
Independency</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>The PowerUp system software offers mainly three interfaces, the HAL 
(Hardware
Abstraction Layer), the ABI (Application Binary Interface) and the API (Application
Programming Interface). The HAL is by definition always hardware dependant.
It is a low level software provided by the hardware manufacturer, which
communicates directly with the hardware. To obtain optimal performance and
to utilize all hardware features, complete knowledge of the underlying hardware
is necessary. This is fact for our current hardware as well as any other
processor hardware which will be developed in future.</P>

<P>The ABI is the next layer of system software which uses the HAL as basics.
It can be seen as the &quot;physical&quot; definition of the interface.
This means, the ABI is responsible for correct implementation of register
layouts for system calls. Different kinds of hardware using a compatible
HAL may use the same ABI. Our proposed ABI is compliant to the standard
PowerPC EABI from Motorola, which defines platform independent register layouts
and calling conventions. By use of standard Motorola PowerPC-EABI for our
HAL it is possible to use different platforms and software development systems
apart from the Amiga as well as standard software libraries for PowerPC
based systems, such as e.g. the LIBMOTO library developed by Motorola for
MkLinux which speeds up floating point calculations significantly, which
is only possible because of the built-in compatibility to EABI in our HAL
(this LIBMOTO library for example is included by default on the CDROM delivered
with the PowerUp boards).</P>

<P>The API (Application Programmer Interface) is based on the ABI and is
the logical interface definition for applications, which is mainly the definition
of library calls of the PowerUp system software.</P>

<P>The functionality and conventions are documented by the developer notes
included in the PowerUp package or available from phase 5 and will be uniform
for all products of the PowerUp family. Future enhancements and additions
to the functionality will be compatible to the current implementation of
the system libraries. Even main changes to the hardware, like e.g. cluster
based multiprocessing systems, will not require applications using our API
to be adapted and make them take advantage of new capabilities. Therefore
an application, which is compatible to our PowerUp system software and its
API and ABI, is prepared to be fully compatible to various hardware solutions,
even if provided by different vendors. Third party vendors can implement
full compatibility regardless of the individual functionality of the underlying
hardware. Concerning this matter, please also regard to our <B>guidelines to 
PowerUp programming styles.</P>

<P>Summing up it can be said that the conceptual design of our PowerUp system
software fulfils all requirements to implement a standardized software
interface for any kind of processor hardware (including multiprocessing
systems) and offers an optimal hardware independency. The options offered
by our solution are in addition based on well introduced standards, what
results in various benefits for users and developers from the beginning
(as demonstrated by the LIBMOTO example above).
<BR>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE=+1>Amiga conformity and future 
compatibility<BR>
</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>The complete development of PowerUp system software is focused on 
conformity
to the existing Amiga system software. Our solution made it possible to
integrate a new processor transparently and fully compatible into the existing
operating system environment while realizing new concepts and open new ways
for the future.</P>

<P>As documented in the articles about <B>guidelines
for implementation of PowerUp applications</B>, <B>multiprocessing
capabilities</B> and the <B>hardware independency</B>
resulting from our solution, PowerUp does not only offer extended performance,
it also offers various basics for future hardware and software developments.
By keeping the PowerUp system software as open as possible while preserving
compatibility to major industrial standards we keep doors open for developers
to participate on an innovative future for the Amiga. We are convinced that
the Amiga should be open to cross platform standards without losing the
positive and unique features of the Amiga and the Amiga operating system.</P>

<P>We do not deny that parts of our conceptual design are prepared to lead
to the A\BOX. We like to give all developers, who work on new software 
generations
for the currently introduced new processor, the possibility and security
to easy switch to next generation machines independent from the - yet not
determined - plans and decisions of the system vendor Amiga International.
There is still no security, that those will fulfil the expectations of
the Amiga community, even if we and all other people dedicated to the Amiga
hope so. By keeping this in mind, we think it makes sense to provide also
alternatives with our concept for developers and users to gain and offer
long term perspectives.</P>

<P>With our solution, however, also a major improvement and evolution of
the Amiga operating system is supported, because by using the structured
design that we recommend to use, the new generation software with a modular
design can easily be adapted to any modifications of the operating system.
This offers the developers of the Amiga operating system much more flexibility
for implementation of new features. This implies that software development
under PowerUp makes major modifications of the operating system possible
and is open to conceptual design changes. In addition we are open to share
the technology and software designs with Amiga International in a 
cooperation.</P>

<P>In summary, there are simply no valid arguments for the resistance against
the introduction of open standards, structured programming and an application
software design which is as much independent as possible from the current
operating system version to be prepared for future development of the operating
system. The strict devotion to existing structures and the approach to develop
a new generation of software for a new processor while fully preserving
the actual operating system is contrary to a concept open for the future.
<BR>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE=+1>The ELF Linker Format<BR>
</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>Related to the discussion about the ELF format, that was chosen as the
main executable format for PowerUp, there is simply to say, that it is completely
insignificant to the user, which linker format is used for software development.
The statement, this would lead away from the Amiga is incorrect, which is
proofed by the implementation of the GNU C system and additional compilers
like SAS-C.</P>

<P>Correct is, that by using that new format development has to use different
and new paths. But it is not correct, that basic features of the Amiga are
dropped by the use of ELF as main linker format. Especially shared libraries,
which are possible despite of the use of the ELF format, are possible under
the PowerUp system software. In addition, the PowerUp System Software is
also prepared to use Mixed Binaries. Therefore there is no need to either
generate Mixed or Fat Binaries nor is there a need to reload ELF executables;
it is simply up to the developer to choose one of these implementations
by the way his programs are structured.
<BR>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE=+1>Recommended Guidelines for 
the implementation
of <BR>
PPC software on PowerUp systems</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>We will not cover programming styles here in detail; there is quite a
lot of documentation out there on this topic in our developer notes, the
libraries and autodocs as well as the various examples provided by us. We
will just discuss the basics to structured development under PowerUp.</P>

<P>Most important for porting software to the PowerUp is a conceptual guideline
which phase 5 recommends to all developers. When porting or optimizing software
to/for PowerUp (which effectively also means working on a completely new
processor type) we recommend that the developers structure their software
programs internally, if they haven't already done so.</P>

<P>To gain optimal performance out of the hardware design currently available
and to secure an open design to future developments, we recommend the use
of modular program structures by using sub tasks, which we call threads
subsequently, because our approach is equivalent to multi-threading (a procedure
where tasks create subtasks for different jobs). We are not covering details
on memory allocation or memory protection for multi threaded systems in
this description, because this is very much dependant on the options available
from the operating system. The multi threading mechanisms implemented in
the PowerUp system software are already prepared for memory protection,
and as soon as it is implemented in the operating system, applications using
the PowerUp system software benefit automatically from the memory 
protection.</P>

<P>The programmer can choose for all threads whether they should use the
68k or the PowerPC CPU. The asynchronous communication is handled fully
transparently by our message system,
which is used to exchange signals, messages and data between the different
tasks. An efficient policy is for example to design a 68k master task which
is used in the current implementation of PowerUp to start up the program,
that handles the user interface and all related OS calls which are currently
68k based. This main task subsequently creates the threads required for
the various jobs. Asynchronous file I/O operations for example may be implemented
as a 68k thread while applying filter operations to a 24 bit graphics runs
as a PPC thread. In this example, the 68k main thread sends a signal to
the PPC thread and can continue to act on user input. The PPC thread sends
back a signal upon completion of the filter operation to the controlling
68k thread which continues to act on the results, e.g. by copying the graphics
data to a destination window. Of course subthreads can communicate to other
subthreads without intervention of parent threads.</P>

<P>This implementation enables any application to automatically benefit
from multi-processor designs. If for the above example the main thread instructs
a subthread to work on an image manipulation operation which takes 30 seconds,
the user does not need to wait for the busy pointer to disappear, but he
can work on. In addition the programmer can ask the system for the number
of CPUs present on the system and use this information to launch multiple
identical sub threads, which are dispatched to different CPUs by the PowerUp
system software, and which all execute a certain part of a complex operation.
This enables programmers today to actually develop software which is prepared
to use multitasking, multithreading and multiprocessing.</P>

<P>In addition this proposed procedure in combination with the 
<B>implemented multiprocessing</B> capabilities allows
easy implementation of future developments of innovative hardware whith
easy support by existing applications. So it is possible for developers
to be prepared to use for example high end 3D hardware or special DSPs for
multimedia operations as expansion products which can be implemented as Zorro
III boards or even be connected via a local network and incorporate special
functions, like a GL implementation or a MPEG/JPEG engine. All they will
need to use this is to define a message port and the necessary message data
structure. The vendor of a 3D or multimedia application that uses the PowerUp
message system only needs to know the message port name, the function set
and the message types to be able to fully use the extended hardware.</P>

<P>The multithreading system, that does not conflict with the <B>Amiga OS 
philosophy</B>, will be of advantage concerning
future compatibility for software applications by taking advantage from
the strict distinction of PowerPC and 68k based code segments, since for
future OS developments the currently 68k based code parts can be easily
replaced or updated. If for example the 68k based graphics calls will be
replaced by a PPC native graphics system, the 68k library calls can be easily
replaced by PPC calls for structured applications, especially if those new
calls need a new structure or have extended functionality. We think this
approach has a much better focus on any possible future development than
any mixed binary solution that requires lots of context switches and may
lead in addition to a lack of structured task dispatchment. By proposing
our solution we give the developers, who develop with and under PowerUp,
the security that applications will be easy to port, mostly hardware independent
and prepared even for major changes of a possible future operating system,
which we consider as important for the future development of the Amiga.
<BR>
In regards to Warpup and the related public discussion, we have decided
not to extend the discussion and to concentrate on technical facts only.
In the technical documents published here most questions concerning our
concepts and our hardware and software solutions are answered, which will
help all readers to sort out misinformation and decide on their own which
conceptual implementation and vision for the future they want to support.</P>

<P>We will not influence the Warpup development of Haage&amp;Partner in
any ways, nor will we support this product or developments using this software.
It is up to Haage&amp;Partner as the makers of this product to provide full
PowerUp compatibility, which means compatibility to the PowerUp hardware
and the PowerUp System Software. While this is not given, we do not recommend
Warpup at all, and we give no guarantee or accept any liability or responsibility
for the functionality, the performance, the compatibility or the usability
of PowerUp Systems on which Warpup is installed, for any purpose.
