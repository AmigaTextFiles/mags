<P>
It's a F1 type racing game that caused a real impact when a demo of it appeared 
in Aminet, it used to be formally called Alien F1 but its real name will either end 
up 
as "Grand Prix Simulator" or "Virtua GP".

The author has been very busy, with the game now under heavy development after 
he was out doing other things for a year.  The game currently runs at about 12-15 
fps on a '030 25MHz Amiga, this is off course depending on the board and on the 
Fast Ram speed, and the author Paolo Cattani has said it simply Flies on '040/'060 
Amiga's.
