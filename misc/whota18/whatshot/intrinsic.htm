<P>Due to the runaway success of the Amigo Tower system for the A1200 and 
the
tremendous review in CU Amiga (90%), we now have the facility to bulk buy
the components that are included in our Amigo 1200 Multimedia Station.

<P>We have decided to support DIY Amiga owners with the following prices.

<P>Laser cut powder coated backplate (off white) to accept Amiga motherboard,
PSU, CDDA out etc 470mm X 165mm
£14.95

<P>Tower with above backplate fitted
£69.95

<P>Tower with above backplate supplied but not fitted ( four rivets and screws
to remove )
£59.95

<P>Ateo keyboard interface
£29.95

<P>Front plate adaptor (powder coated off white)
£3.00

<P>PSU adaptor
£9.95

<P>Dual device lead to connect HD and CDrom
£9.95

<P>PC Keyboard
£19.95

<P>Because of the nature of the above, there will be no manual supplied,
although anybody interested in the DIY tower should know what they are doing
anyway. To add to that we can supply a Full coulour bound manual with
digital photo`s to assist you. As this is obviously expensive, even to us in
the quantity that we use, a charge of £4.95 would be added.

<P>NONE of the parts would be fitted, simply supplied. the backplates will not
be marked up to show the ports and they will be unbadged.

<P>Technical support will be limited to Email icstech@centrenet.co.uk or
newsgroups.

<P>All towers would be subject to £10.00 P&P, other parts £2.00 P&P

<P>This is a rock bottom price as there is no labour involved for us.

<P>So there you go, you could tower up for less than £100.00
