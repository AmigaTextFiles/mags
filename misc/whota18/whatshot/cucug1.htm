<P>January 11, 1998 - The Gateway Computer Show <I>Amiga 98</I> which
will be held in St. Louis, Missouri on March 13, 14 &amp; 15, 1998, is
gaining in momentum and growing in size, according to its host club,
the <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/tower-bin/cucug-ad-gac.pl">Gateway
Amiga Club, Inc. (GAC)</A>, also located in St. Louis and its producer
Bob Scharp. The show, normally held for two days, has been expanded to
three days to accomodate additional classes with the usual two days of
exhibitions.

<P>The excellent organizational and promotional efforts of members of the 
venerable
St. Louis club are paying off greatly this year and the show promises
to be their best ever, according to industry observers. &quot;Many
shows do not go to the efforts these folks do to promote themselves.
GAC has pulled out the stops and is utilizing direct mail, flyers,
the Internet, radio and television as well,&quot; said Kevin Hisel, of
the <A HREF="../../../index.html">Champaign-Urbana Computer Users Group 
(CUCUG)</A> another club
located in neighboring Illinois which is also promoting the show
on their popular web site, <A HREF="../../../amiga.html">The Amiga Web 
Directory</A>.

<P>A long list of Amiga-oriented companies have already committed to
attending the show. According to show organizer Bob Scharp, with more
to come. Already commited to attend include AEMail, Amazing Computing,
Amiga Atlanta Inc., Amiga Informer Magazine, Amiga Inc., Amiga
International Inc., Amiga User Group Network, Asimware Innovations
Inc., the Champaign-Urbana Computer Users Group (CUCUG), Compuquick Media
Center, Dan's Deals, FWD Computing, The Gateway Amiga Club Inc.
(G.A.C.), Intangable Assets Manufacturing (I.A.M.), Legacey Maker
Inc., National Amiga, North Coast Amiga Users Group (N.C.A.U.G.), Nova
Design Inc., Power Computing LTD., Prowave Inc., Scharp Designs,
SoftLogik Publishing Corp.

<P>In addition to the companies, show attendees will include famous
Amiga personalities from all over the world.

<P>According to <A
HREF="http://www.cucug.org/tower-bin/cucug-ad-gac.pl">information from
GAC's web site</A>, popular Amiga video hardware/software experts
have agreed to sponsor classes and
Amiga computer manufacturer Amiga International is expected to donate an Amiga
4000T (Tower) computer to the show as a door prize.<SUP>1</SUP>

<P>&quot;CUCUG plans to attend Amiga 98 again in full force. This year we
plan to have an official presence and will be hosting an exhibitor
booth at the show. Our members had a great time in all the previous
years we attended and we are anticipating an even better show this
year,&quot; Hisel said.

<P>&quot;With your help, we can make the Amiga shine, and the entire
community know that Amiga is not only back, but the future is very bright 
indeed!&quot;
Scharp commented about the show.
