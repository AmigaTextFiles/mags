A week or so ago, I received an e-mail from Chuck Patterson, who maintains the 
AmigaRing, informing me of his Amiga Ring, after noticing one of my web pages 
on ClickBOOM's Amiga Ring and also voiced concerns about the ClickBOOM Amiga 
Ring's graphics, which didn't mention anything about the Amiga and that there it 
was more of ClickBOOM commerical ring than an Amiga Ring.  On surfing through 
Amiga web pages for a couple of years, I've run in to the AmigaRing many times 
over and even though I've been maintaining at least one web page for year, it was 
until I heard of the ClickBOOM's Amiga Ring, that I became a member of that ring 
and never thought of becoming a member of the AmigaRing has there has been a 
lot of fuss made about ClickBOOM's Amiga Ring, since it's appearence, few months 
ago.  But, from now, I will pledging my support to the AmigaRing as well as 
ClickBOOM's Amiga Ring for as long as both around.<p>
Well, after receiving this e-mail, I checked out the AmigaRing web page at <A 
HREF="http://www.azstarnet.com/~midian/amigaring.html</A>
http://www.azstarnet.com/~midian/amigaring.html and talk to others that have 
heard of it and had a look at some of the sites that are a part of the AmigaRing.  
Soon afterwards, I submitted all the urls of all my web sites to the AmigaRing, and 
thus became a part of the AmigaRing.
<p>
Well, I was surprised to find out that the AmigaRing has been around since 
September 1996, and at the moment has more than 150 sites in the ring.
<p>
So, if you want to join the AmigaRing, read the following which is from the 
AmigaRing web site which gives information on how to join.

submitting your page to the AmigaRing queue. Please note this <FONT 
SIZE=4><B>does not</B></FONT> insert you into the ring! It just registers 
you with the program and assigns you a <EM>site ID number</EM>.
<LI>After filling out the form, you will receive your <EM>site ID 
number</EM>. Write it down.
<LI>You will see six sections in the HTML that have underscored areas ("_____"). 
Replace ALL of these with your SITE ID number. For example, if your site ID is 10, 
the href should be something like: <STRONG>http://www.webring.org/cgi-
bin/webring?ring=amiga;id=10;next</STRONG>.
<LI>Now, to be added to AmigaRing, you need to e-mail the owner of any 
existing AmigaRing site and have him/her add you to the ring. Make sure to 
include your site ID number. To keep the time that your page is up without links to 
a minimum, you may want to contact the owner of a site if you know where they 
are.
<LI>The person that you requested to add you to the ring should do 
so...(he/she'll most likely visit your web first), then they should send you an E-mail 
confirming it. Then... you're DONE! :)

<STRONG><FONT COLOR=RED>Special Note:</FONT></STRONG> If you 
have the desire, feel free to design your own layout that is more appropriate to 
your web page.  Not all image themes will match everyone's page.  The only 
limitation is that the links relate to what they are for and are easy to find. If your 
web page is text based, feel free to use a text layout.  Before using the images and 
layout designed by someone else on the ring, be sure to send them email and ask 
their permission.

I hope that every Amiga web page will become a part of Chuck Patterson's 
AmigaRing and I wonder does anybody out there know how many sites are in 
ClickBOOM's Amiga Ring?
