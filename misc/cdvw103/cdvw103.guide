@NODE edit "Editorial Page"
Wow!  What a month April was!  First, Commodore started the month off with
a whimper and then followed with silence.  No one knows what's going on,
until the last day of the month, when they announce that they're going out
of business.  Details are sketchy as I write this, but a full report is in
the news section.

I had to sell my Amiga 4000/030.  Yuck!  I hated doing it, but I
had to.  (School tuition)  Packing my machine up was one of the hardest
things I've had to do.  I was proud of it for six months, but I guess all
good things must end.  As a result, I'm having a hard time getting good
quality screen shots for the magazine.  The Microcosm screenshots we ran
last issue were captured on a Video Toaster and then JPEG'd  (By someone
else, not me.)  I then converted them to GIF files and loaded them as
brushes into Personal Paint.  Without an AGA machine, I can't make good
256 color pics.  I'll see what I can come up with for the next issue.
This month's pic, a shot of the Insight: Technology package, was done on
a Migraph MS-1200 flatbed scanner.  
 
If you take a look in the Serial Port this month, you'll see a letter I
received over the Internet about the magazine being too small and too
infrequent (only monthly).  Well, I tried to increase the number of
reviews in this issue.  There's no way I can go to a biweekly magazine,
due to lack of actual material (CD³² games don't get released THAT often) 
and the fact that I just do not have the time.  Remember, you can
contribute reviews if you've got them!  Help me out!

Also, starting with this issue, I'm no longer including the Amiga Viewtek
program to view the pictures.  You should already have it from the first
two issues.  (If not, you can call my BBS and download the program or the
first two issues of CD³²View!)  Make sure the program is either in the
directory you put this magazine or in your command path.  If not, it's
no big deal, you just won't be able to view the pictures from inside the
newsletter.  If you have a GIF viewer of any kind, you can still view the
pictures manually.  (If you don't have an Amiga, don't worry, this doesn't
apply to you.  Non-Amiga owners HAVE to view the GIFs manually.)

I apologize for this issue being a little late.  Due to the scheduled 
conference on Compuserve concerning the Commodore Stockholders Movement,
I decided to delay the release of the magazine until after the conference
so as to be able to report what's going on and what happened.

@NODE MAIL "The Serial Port - Mail from our readers!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------
From: SIMON SIMPLETON <JEP@NAUVAX.UCC.NAU.EDU>

Dear folks at CD32View,
	I recently downloaded issue 2 of your magazine and was quite
impressed by it!  Good job!  I only have two regrets: 1> Another month
is too long to wait! (I already downloaded and read last month's...)
2> One picture isn't enough!
	I am very impressed with the philosophy of your magazine (no
bickering about which system's better; focus on software).  So here are
my minor requests:
		1> More pictures? one just isn't enough.  It
			would be nice to see a picture for
			every game reviewed.  True, this would
			increase file size dramatically, but
			I don't mind longer downloads if it's
			worth it.  I was especially disappointed
			that Labyrinth of Time didn't have an
			accompanying screenshot.
		2> More on downward/upward compatibilty.  I'd
			very much like a CD32, but I'm not sure
			if my old CDTV CD's will run on it.
			Also, I think every CD32 game reviewed
			should have a note as to whether the
			game will run on a CDTV or A570.
		3> Distribute CD32View so that it opens in its
			own directory; i.e., it doesn't clutter
			the directory it's dearchived into.
Thanks, and I look forward to more of your magazine!

[ CD³²View Replies:

Thanks for the comments, John.  I'd love to increase the frequency
of the magazine, but right now there's no way to do that with the time I
have available.  As for the pictures, I hope to have more pictures in the
next issue.  (See the editorial column for the reasons.)

As for the CDTV issue, I have tried to provide that information.  See the
column in this issue.  

I'd love to have CD³²View open in it's own directory but, remember, this
isn't a magazine for the Amiga only.  I try to accomodate any other
platform by also including the ASCII version of the magazine.  Not being
familiar with any other platforms other than the IBM and Amiga, I'm not
sure how, say, a Mac would react to that.  It's not too hard to use a
directory utility or the Amiga's CLI to create a directory before
dearchiving the magazine, is it?  ]

MPEG Report Delayed Yet Again
-----------------------------

Commodore's MPEG module hasn't been seen for over two months now.  We
should have reviewed it when we had the chance in February.  We will make
sure it gets reviewed as soon as we get our hands on one.  We also had to
delay our reviews of DEFENDER OF THE CROWN II and the GROLIER'S
ENCYCLOPEDIA due to lack of product availability.  Now that Commodore's
gone though, it doesn't look like the chances are good that we'll see any
of these anytime soon.

This newsletter is created on Amiga computers.

It is worked on in various stages using an Amiga 2500 or an Amiga 3000T.
It all depends on where I am sitting at the time I'm typing...and I'm
always carrying a disk in my jacket with the most current version.

Software used: 

MEmacs, the editor supplied with every Amiga.  It's SIMPLY the best.  I've
tried others, but only MEmacs works for me.  Hey, at least I don't use ED!

Guide2Doc, by Bernd Koesling, is used to produce the ASCII/ANSI version
of the newsletter.  Thanks Koessi! 

BadLinks, by Roger Nedel, is used to test the links in the Amigaguide

@NODE GAME1 "The Chaos Engine Review"
Ahhh!  A game that can take on the big guys: Sega and Nintendo.  Sega and
SNES owners can already play this game under the name SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE.
It was even picked by Sega as their third-party game of the year for the
Genesis machine.

This is a shoot-'em-up, plain and simple.  It's a great one too, with
tons of power-ups, hidden levels and lots of enemies to blast.  

The game revolves around the idea of a machine called The Chaos Engine
that has unleashed a "cloud of Chaos" upon the world.  Animals and men 
have been mutated into horrible beasts as a result.  Six soldiers of
fortune (Thug, Mercenary, Preacher, Gentleman, Navvie and Brigand) are
called in to disable the Chaos Engine and make things as they once were.

The player (or players, as this can be played by two at one time) picks
the soldier of fortune to control.  Each has his own special weapons and
abilities.  Basically, the object is to blast through each of the 16 levels
collecting power-ups and activating nodes which allow passage to the next
level.

The game is pretty much a straight port of the Amiga AGA version, but in
this case that's not too much of a liability.  The original was good and
this is a console type game.  The graphics, while sparse, are quite
effective.  Anything else really would have been overkill.

This is a great game to sit down and just blast away with.  The manual has
the following line:  "Sure, I'd waste anything I saw and I wouldn't think
twice about it either."  How appropriate!

@NODE GAME2 "Summer Olympix Review"
Billed as a humorous sports simulation, SUMMER OLYMPIX allows gamers to
compete in eight events: Boxing, Long Jump, Swimming, Javelin, Kayaking,
Skeet Shooting, Archery, and the 100 Meter Sprint.

Each player (up to four can play) begins the game by entering their name
and picking a country to represent.  The events can be played in a
constant order (the same every game) or can be shuffled so as to keep the
players on their toes.

The archery event is one of the best parts of the game.  The player must
press the red button on the CD³²'s controller to stop the archer's arm
when the bow is drawn to the desired power setting.  The shot must then be
aimed to compensate for wind direction.  By "one of the best parts," I'm
saying it's one of the events that's actually fun to play.  Some are not.

One of those is the swimming event.  The 200 meter dash requires
the player to tap the top left and right buttons as fast as possible while
trying to keep the onscreen swimmer oxygenated by pressing the red button
when required.  Sound confusing?  It's not that hard to do, it's just very
hard to do it well enough to qualify.  The game has very high difficulty
levels and no way to set them lower for new players to get the hang of
each event.

The javelin event is another that requires the tapping of the top left and
right buttons.  While doing that, you must also hold the red button until
the onscreen graph shows the desired angle of your throw.  Releasing the
button is supposed to make you throw the javelin.  Sometimes you do,
sometimes you don't.  It's actually possible to qualify in this event,
just not consistently.  

The long jump is quite similar to the javelin event.  This time you pick
the angle of your jump.  It's even less consistent and much more
frustrating.

The kayaking event requires you to manuever your kayak through 10 marker
buoys while trying to beat the clock.  You view this from an overhead
perspective.  There's not a whole lot to do in this event except to steer
the kayak in the right direction.  Pressing up on the directional pad
makes you speed up, pressing down makes you go slower.  This one takes
some practice and isn't aggrivating.

The 100 meter sprint is another left/right button smacking contest.  Just
hit the buttons as fast as possible and you've got the hang of it.  It's
possible to qualify at this event too.

Boxing is the absolute worst event in the whole bunch.  The instructions
tell you to watch for your opponent's reach or your chances of victory
could be slim.  This, roughly translated, means the computer can beat the
hell out of you, but you can't hit him.  You'll get knocked out in less
than thirty seconds.

Skeet shooting is the second most frustrating event.  The clay targets fly
toward the horizon while the player must aim the cursor to blast them. 
Since only one shot is allocated for each target and the control is
hampered by really shoddy programming, this event is likely to be
hazardous to any gamers with high blood pressure.

If some effort had been put into this game, it could have been a lot of
fun.  Some of the best times I ever had while playing videogames was
playing the Epyx SUMMER GAMES series on the old Commodore 64.  This game
has some (but not much) of the chemistry from that series of games.  The
archery event is a joy to play.  It's fun and funny.  (Miss the target
once, if you get a chance to play it.)

Unfortunately, much of the game is too hard to control.  That's partly the
fault of bad programming and partly because of the CD³²'s controller not
being built to be held in a position to be slammed on.

An example of the bad programming is the slowdown that occurs when a
second clay target appears during the skeet shooting.  It's only one
additional object on the screen!  It can't possibly slow the cursor
movement down like that for any other reason but poor programming.  Also,
at several times during different events, the screen would slowly start to
break up.  It never caused the game to fail, but it was annoying and
shouldn't happen in the first place.

SUMMER OLYMPIX is a game that had the potential to be a great game, but
fell on it's face.

@NODE GAME3 "Insight: Technology Review"
Ever wondered how it is that an aqualung allows scuba-divers to breathe
underwater?  Ever wondered how a modem works?  Well, if so, this title may
be just the right thing for you to pick up for your CD³².  INSIGHT:
TECHNOLOGY shows how things work by using diagrams, animations,
full-motion video clips and sound.
 
This is one of the first multimedia titles for the CD³² that actually
carry the CD³² logo.  (The only other current CD³² multimedia title is the
new GROLIER'S ENCYCLOPEDIA and, just like that title, INSIGHT:TECHNOLOGY
works just fine on the CDTV as well.)  

Popping the disc into the CD³² unit and booting up starts a demo.  Press
any button on the controller and the main menu appears.  The main menu is
made up of five options:  TOPICS, BROWSE, INDEX, HELPTOUR and CREDITS.

Selecting TOPICS brings up an A to Z list of available topics that can be
scrolled through using the CD³²'s controller.  (Pretty logical, huh?)  To
the right of some topics is a filmstrip symbol, which indicates that topic
includes a filmed video sequence.

Select a topic and a screen divided into three sections appears.  A title
bar at the top of the screen allows the user to flip through the topics in
alphabetical order.  On the left side of the screen is a text description
of the topic.  On the right side are two pictures.  Selecting the top
picture with the controller presents a diagram with labels on all the parts
and starts an audio explanation of the diagram.  Selecting the bottom
picture starts a slideshow showing the selected item in action and also
starts a different audio narration.  This concludes with a filmed video
sequence if that topic includes one.

Hitting the blue botton on the controller will take you to the previous
menu at any time.

Selecting BROWSE will randomly select a topic for the user to read.  It
bypasses the topic menu completely.  If the controller is not touched for
a few seconds, another topic will be selected.

Selecting INDEX will present the user with a list of over 2000 keywords. 
Selecting one of the keywords will present the user with a list of the
topics that word is found in.  You can the select the topic and it will be
presented in the same way as simply selecting it from the TOPICS menu,
except that the keyword will be highlighted everytime it is used.

For example, I found the word "Amiga" was used in two articles ("CDTV
Multimedia Player" and "computer").  I selected "computer" and was told
that the Amiga is one of the currently popular models along with the Atari
ST.  (Hmmmm...I wonder if the skies are blue in their world.  <G>)

The HELPTOUR is merely a guided tour of the INSIGHT:TECHNOLOGY options. 
It explains everything I just mentioned.

The CREDITS are exactly what it sounds like.  It simply gives you the
names of the people responsible for the program.

As one of the first educational titles of the CD³², this title has a high
profile whether it warrants one or not.  It's a very solid program, but
one of limited scope and usefulness.  If you have inquisitive children,
this would make a fine toy for them to play with.  I would not, however,
recommend this program as a primary teaching tool.  Some of the
information seems dated even though the program has a 1993 copyright date.
The CDTV is included as a topic and a keyword, but the CD³² is not.  Also,
because of the British origin of the program, the spelling of some words
(like colour instead of color, for example) may confuse younger children.

@NODE GAME4 "Frontier: Elite II Review"
FRONTIER:ELITE II was one of the most anticipated games on both the Amiga
and PC platforms.  When it finally arrived last year, many marveled at how
large the game was compared to how small the actual program was.  The
entire FRONTIER universe was contained on a single disk.

The game itself is hard to describe.  It's a combination
strategy/action/simulation game.  You are given a ship and a small amount
of cash and it's up to you to choose what you do with it.  You can join
the military, become a smuggler, run a small trade route, become a pirate,
or whatever other niche you'd like to inhabit.

When it was announced that a CD³² version was in the works, gamers drooled
at the thought that the game would be enhanced to take advantage of the
massive storage capacity of the CD-ROM format.  The game could receive the
texture mapping present in the PC version.  The sound could be improved. 
The game was already great, any changes made would be the icing on the
cake.  

Forget it.

The CD³² version of FRONTIER: ELITE II is a straight port of the Amiga
version with the only modifications being to the control system to allow
the use of the CD32 controller.

The game itself remains great.  Unfortunately, this IS a computer game.  I
strongly recommend that, if you choose to purchase this game, you get a
keyboard and a mouse for the CD³².  The CD³²'s controller pads are not
made to control a game like this.  Moving the ship around requires a large
dose of finesse control.  The odd button combinations required to get
something done prohibit you from being anything but clumsy.  (Example:  To
fire your laser, you must press the top left button and the red button.
Not too bad, but try doing it while tracking an enemy ship.  You have to
press the top left button, move the directional pad and press the red
button all at the same time.)  At the least, get a mouse and a joystick to
control the game if you plan to buy it.

This is a game that cannot be recommended to just any CD³² owner.  To get
any enjoyment out of the game, you must be able to save your progress and
control your movements a lot better than the standard setup will allow.

If you're planning on expanding your CD³² with the coming SX-1 module or
something similar, you might want to even consider buying the hard drive
installable Amiga version of the game.  You wouldn't be missing anything 
and it's currently cheaper than the CD³² version.  The SX-1 would allow
you to connect a floppy drive to the CD³², allowing you to save more than
one game at a time.  Currently, the CD³² is only capable of saving one
FRONTIER game at a time in it's memory.  No matter how you slice it, the
CD³² alone isn't the ideal platform to play this game on.  Some type of
accessory or another is required to really enjoy the game.

It's a shame that more enhancements weren't added.  This is a game that
could have really shined on the CD³².  It's a shame that you have to
expand your CD³² into a computer to get the full enjoyment out it.  Once
you do expand your CD³² into a computer, why not just get the computer
version anyway?  It's cheaper.

@NODE GAME5 "Dangerous Streets Review"
When a game has the loading instructions on the bootup screen, one tends
to question the amount of thought put into it.   

I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on this game other than to say
that it is, by far, the worst game EVER released for the CD³² and is in
the running for worst game in videogaming history.

To say this game is a disappointment would be a tremendous understatement.
The advance screenshots looked wonderful.  Granted, the graphics aren't
bad at all...when they're not moving.  What the screenshots couldn't
convey, however, was the quality of the gameplay, which is horrible...
absolutely horrible.  

This is supposed to be a beat-em-up game like Street Fighter 2 or Mortal
Kombat.  Take out the personality, gameplay and fun and you have Dangerous
Streets.

What makes this game so bad?  The control is horrible.  The graphics are
very poor in showing what is actually happening.  (They look quite
interesting when nothing is happening, but the animation is so bad you
cannot tell if you're hitting your opponent or not.)  This is a beat-em-up
where you can't get your fighter to move and then can't tell if you've hit
anything when it does move.  Not the stuff a good game is made of.

Please, unless you like unpleasantness, avoid this game.  If you NEED a
beat-em-up for your CD³², you can get International Karate +.  I realize
that we tore that game apart last issue but, compared to Dangerous
Streets, it's light years ahead of this game in the fun department.

@NODE GAME6 "Brutal Football Review"
As a football fan, I really wasn't too keen on the idea of a football game
that wasn't really a football game.  That is, I felt that way until I
played BRUTAL FOOTBALL.

BRUTAL FOOTBALL is a knock down, beat-em-up, rip-their-heads-off
combination of soccer, rugby and American football.  One or two players
can face each other or play the computer in leagues or a tournament mode.  

The basic premise is simple:  Put the ball into the goal at one end of
the field while preventing your opponent from doing so to the goal at the
opposite end.  Unlike most other sports, their are no rules on the field. 
An opponent can tackle you, stab you, stomp on you, or rip your head off
and, likewise, you can do the same to him.  Various powerups can help or
hinder you as you try to rack up the score (and the head count.)

The graphics are adequate.  Sometimes, the field is so cluttered with
heads, players, powerups and the actual field markings, that it is hard to
see where the ball actually is.  The soundtrack is provided by a CD audio
track of an Eddie Van Halen-type guitar riff that gets annoying after a
few games.  Unfortunately, the "music off" option that is provided didn't
seem to work for very long.  Sometimes it didn't work at all.

This is a game that cries out to be played by two players.  It tends to
get a little boring playing against the computer.  The computer is either
hot or cold.  It will play like it's brain dead one game and then play
like it's on speed the next.  Close games with the computer as an opponent
are likely to be few and far between.  Against a human opponent, however,
this game is classic videogaming.  It's a blast to watch your friend's
face as your rip one of his team member's heads off.

Highly recommended for those that can stomach it.  As the heavy metal band
Exodus used to sing, "Good violent friendly fun in store for all."

@NODE RATINGS "The Ratings - Explained"

We judge the games we review in four different categories:

Graphics
--------
This is pretty self explanatory.  The higher the percentile, the better
the graphics are.

Sound
-----
Another no-brainer.  The higher the percentile, the better the sound. 
Although, this also relates to it's coordination with the gameplay.  If 
the sound seems inappropriate for the type of game it is, the game will
score lower in the Sound category even if the sounds are technically well
done.

Gameplay
--------
The gameplay refers to the addictive quality of the game as well as the
way the game plays.  If you find your self sitting and watching rather
than interacting with the game, the game will score lower than one that
actually involves you.

Control
-------
This refers to how easy the game is to control given the standard CD³² 
controller.  A game requiring a special controller that is not specified
or not included will be penalized.  A game that comes with a special 
controller or one that recommends that, say, an Amiga mouse might work
better than the standard CD³² controller will not be penalized.

@NODE NEWS1 "Commodore:Out of Business"
   WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) -- Commodore International Ltd., a pioneer in
the personal computer industry, said late Friday it is going out of
business.  
   The company plans to transfer its assets to unidentified trustees
"for the benefit of its creditors" and has placed its major subsidiary,
Commodore Electronics Ltd., into voluntary liquidation.  
   "This is the initial phase of an orderly voluntary liquidation of both
companies," Commodore said in a brief statement.  
   Company executives could not immediately be reached Friday evening.  
   The company last month reported an $8.2 million loss for the quarter
ending Dec. 31 on sales of $70.1 million. A year earlier, Commodore lost
$77.2 million on sales of $237.7 million in the same period.  
   In the latest report, Commodore said financial limits had thwarted its
ability to supply products, leading to weakened sales. One of its new
products, the Amiga CD32 video game, had sold poorly in Europe, where the
company did most of its business.  
   The company's net worth turned negative in the fiscal year ended last
June 30.  
   Its stock, which had traded at around $3 per share before the quarterly
results were announced last month, closed unchanged at 87 1/2 cents per
share on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.  
   "This is a company that briefly captured the attention of the American
market and didn't go where the market was going," said David Coursey,
editor of the newsletter P.C. Letter in San Mateo, Calif. "They just never
managed to change with the marketplace."  
   While grabbing some market share and attention in the late 1970s,
Commodore's products were something between PCs and game machines "and never
quite became either," Coursey said.  
   Commodore started 40 years ago as a typewriter repair company in the
Bronx. Its extension to the adding machine business paved the way for it
to make calculators and then personal computers by the mid-1970s.  
   Commodore competed with Radio Shack for the first computers sold to
homes and co-founder Jack Tramiel became a highly-regarded figure in the
fledgling PC industry.  
   By the early 1980s, it was overshadowed in the PC business by Apple
Computer Inc. and IBM. Software manufacturers didn't create as much software
for Commodore's Amiga line as it did for Apple and IBM-compatible machines.  
   In recent years, most of Commodore's business was in Europe.  
   NewTek Inc. of Topeka, Kan., created a product called Video Toaster
that converted Commodore's Amiga to a video-editing system. The $2,500
product was popular with small advertising agencies and home hobbyists.
The company's phones were busy Friday night.

@NODE NEWS4 "CSM Speaks - The Compuserve Conference"

On May 1, 1994, Mike Levin of the Commodore Stockholder's Movement
appeared on Compuserve to address the future of Commodore and the Amiga. 
What follows is a raw transcript of the conference.

------------------------------- cut --------------------------------------

(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Ok... let me start with the formal stuff, I have a comment
 and then 
(1-23,Greg Knapp) start!
(1-52,Chris Lester) Since I call LD for a hook-up... I triple that.
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) I'll ask for a opening statement.
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Welcome one and all!
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Please welcome our guest Mike Levin, the spokesman for the
 Commodore
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Shareholders Movement (CSM).  He is here to answer questions
 in regards
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) to the current Commodore situation as he understands it. 
 As well as talk
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) a little about the past events.
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Please welcome Mike, this is his first public conference.
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Remember that this is a formal conference and that all 
 questions should
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) be presented to the moderator (me!) with a ? and wait to be
 recognized.
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Mike, do you have an opening statement?
(1-29,Mike Levin) yes
(1-29,Mike Levin) I will be typing it in real time so bear with me...
(1-29,Mike Levin) There will be no doom and gloom here tonight...        
(1-29,Mike Levin) Two of us will be answering questions- Marc Rifkin and
 muself...
(1-29,Mike Levin) We are long-time CSMers and have dedicated a great deal
 of time in trying
(1-29,Mike Levin) to effect Commodore's course.  Tonight we can speak on
 those activities...
(1-29,Mike Levin) and the activiteis we will continue to do...
(1-29,Mike Levin) We can not speak for Commodore and can not anwer
 questions on sales
(1-29,Mike Levin) figures and performance.
(1-29,Mike Levin) With that out of the way, let's start.
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) I am opening the floor for questions.
(1-8,Karl Kugel) ?
(1-87,Michael Shea) ?
(1-18,John Horton) ?
(1-46,John Gager) ?
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Karl go ahead
(1-6,Carl Hansen) ?
(1-3,Don Suhr) ?
(1-57,Mike Richard) ?
(1-75,Endre R Bujtas) ?
(1-86,BRIAN MORRIS) ?
(1-36,Paul Idol) ?
(1-30,Ezra Palmer-Persen) ?
(1-8,Karl Kugel) I thought it was interesting that the liquidation only
 covered the U.S. and
(1-8,Karl Kugel) parent companies, but seemed to leave the profitably
 European part alone. 
(1-8,Karl Kugel) Any comments?
(1-44,Joe Clasen) ? Who can buy the Amiga Chipset from the liquidators?
 The Highest Bidder?
(1-29,Mike Levin) It is so early.  Commodore is a big company with many
 divisions...
(1-29,Mike Levin) but the parts which are closing down are important
 parts...
(1-29,Mike Levin) including the factories.  When the supply runs out,
 even the European...
(1-29,Mike Levin) companies will not have Amigas to sell, but I don't
 think that that will
(1-29,Mike Levin) be for several months, at least.  GA
(1-25,Tim - GVP, Inc.) ?
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Micheal Shea... Go ahead.
(1-87,Michael Shea) What ever happened with regards to the meeting CSM had
 with CBM creditors?
(1-71,Gene Holmerud) ?
(1-95,Curtis Hendricks) ?
(1-29,Mike Levin) I met with them the beginning of April...
(1-29,Mike Levin) But, their official position was that as a lender, they
 only had certain
(1-22,stephen provost) ?
(1-29,Mike Levin) leagal remedies.  There was not much they could do.
(1-29,Mike Levin) I told them the things about Commodore which they did not
 know...
(1-29,Mike Levin) including the size of Commodore's market, their strengths
 in Europe...
(1-100,Lathal Ponder) [/q
(1-29,Mike Levin) and the potential of the technology, especially if
 Commdore were to...
(1-100,Lathal Ponder) [/q
(1-29,Mike Levin) take the critical step to license.  They were very
 interested in what...
(1-29,Mike Levin) I had to say, but they could not supply me with any new
 informantion...
(1-29,Mike Levin) GA
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) John Horton.. Go ahead.
(1-18,John Horton) Will the Amiga line continue...by who(is anyone going to
 pick it up)?
(1-29,Mike Levin) That is the most important question.  There are several
 possibilities...
(1-29,Mike Levin) which most of you are already aware of.  It is my
 belief...
(1-29,Mike Levin) that no one will continue to make the Amigas which we
 are familiar with...
(1-29,Mike Levin) beyond what the existing supply of chips (Paulas, 8520's)
 will allow...
(1-29,Mike Levin) but instead, someone will pick up the technology and
 license it out to...
(1-33,Ottmar Roehrig) ??
(1-29,Mike Levin) anyone who wants it, and you will see an array of 
 Amiga-ish products...
(1-29,Mike Levin) including cable boxes, game machines, and an
 Amiga-on-a-card for PCs.  GA
(1-24, Sean - CD32View) ?
(1-111,Jay Goodwin) ?
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Carl Hanson.. go ahead
(1-6,Carl Hansen) Welcome Mike and thanks for all your work in the past. 
 What will a share of C= be worth tomorrow and then next week...? GA
(1-29,Mike Levin) Friday's news is definately bad for shareholders...     
(1-29,Mike Levin) First the large creditors will be paid back, then the
 smaller ones...
(1-29,Mike Levin) then the shareholders.  We probably won't see much at all
 when it's done.
(1-29,Mike Levin) GA
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Don .. go ahead.
(1-3,Don Suhr) How much of C= is dead, and what remains? GA
(1-86,BRIAN MORRIS) I've always liked the Amiga and am not going to jump
 on the PC band wagon
(1-29,Mike Levin) Commodore consists of over 30 companies...              
(1-29,Mike Levin) The big parts are gone including Commodore International,
 Commodore 
(1-85,michael biddle) Is there an existing stock of Amiga products that can
 still be purchased?
(1-29,Mike Levin) Business Machines, and Commdore Electronics Limited...  
(1-29,Mike Levin) The rest are sales companies in the respective countries.
  I haven't
(1-29,Mike Levin) heard much news over the weekend beyond the ones that
 have already closed.
(1-29,Mike Levin) GA
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Mike Richard.. Go ahead.
(1-18,John Horton) ?
(1-54,Trent Hawkins) ?
(1-57,Mike Richard) What do you think that this will all mean in the
 short-term for those of us...
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) I have 10 questions in the Queue .. make that 11.. let me
 put a hold on more questions for now.
(1-29,Mike Levin) In the short term, there will definately be a dry period,
 BUT...        
(1-91,William Cooper) +++
(1-29,Mike Levin) continue to buy 3rd party products from GVP, Macrosystems,
 Scala, etc...
(1-91,William Cooper) ATH0
(1-29,Mike Levin) so that when potential purchasers of the Amiga technology
 look at the...
(1-29,Mike Levin) market, they will see something good.  Above all else,
 the market must not...
(1-29,Mike Levin) be allowed to go away. 
(1-29,Mike Levin) GA
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Endre... go ahead.
(1-105,Endre R Bujtas) What is the possibility of a class-action suit in
 behalf of the stockholders agaist M. A;li and the gang
(1-29,Mike Levin) A good one...                      
(1-29,Mike Levin) What is needed is a shareholder with enough of an 
 investment in the...
(1-29,Mike Levin) company and enough money to bring a class-action suit,
 and a top-notch
(1-29,Mike Levin) class-action lawyer who can prove that Commodore stock
 shoul be worth...
(1-29,Mike Levin) around $20 per share now if not for (I don't want to be 
 liable here)...
(1-29,Mike Levin) the inappropriate management.  GA
(1-20,MarkM/MOD)   Paul Idol.. go ahead.
(1-36,Paul Idol) What are CSM's plans and with whom are you working to
 put them into
(1-36,Paul Idol) effect?  In Mark's announcement of this CO he suggested
 that this 
(1-57,Mike Richard) ?
(1-36,Paul Idol) (the liquidation) might be the best thing ever to happen
 for the
(1-36,Paul Idol) Amiga.  This implies concrete knowledge.  My dealer things
(1-36,Paul Idol) thinks that CEI might be trying to take up the reins,
 but this is
(1-36,Paul Idol) just a rumour.  What is fact?  GA
(1-100,Scott Horn) send
(1-29,Mike Levin) Everything is rumor...                                    
(1-29,Mike Levin) The technogy will go to the highest bidder.  Now that
 Commodore management...
(1-29,Mike Levin) is gone, the horse has ben unhobbled.  This is what Mark
 is referring to,
(1-29,Mike Levin) but it is like rolling dice.  My plans are to talk to the
 people necessary...
(1-29,Mike Levin) so that the dice come up ACES for the users and
 developers...
(1-118,Amran Vance) send lxv hi
(1-29,Mike Levin) I think CEI might be able to get the factories running to
 make as many
(1-100,Scott Horn) ustatus
(1-29,Mike Levin) more Amigas as possible if they get a technology license,
 but it is not...
(1-29,Mike Levin) the most profittable venture in the world.  The best
 thing that can be done...
(1-29,Mike Levin) is to demonstrate demand by writing CEI with letters
 saying that you are
(1-29,Mike Levin) ready to buy more Amigas if they are able to build them.
  This is something
(1-29,Mike Levin) which they could "take to the bank."  Actual orders
 would be even better.
(1-29,Mike Levin) GA
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Tim from GVP go ahead...
(1-25,Tim - GVP, Inc.) I have heard that one of the "final straws" on
 Commodore, was that they recently lost a
(1-25,Tim - GVP, Inc.) patent infringement suit based on Multiple-screen
 technology, one of the strong points of the
(1-25,Tim - GVP, Inc.) Amiga.  Is this true, and if so what kind of
 problems would it cause to a potential buyer of the
(1-25,Tim - GVP, Inc.) Amiga chip set?        
(1-29,Mike Levin) From my understanding, the people with the injunction...
(1-71,Gene Holmerud) pass
(1-29,Mike Levin) wanted a one-time payment which other companies have been
 able to pay...
(1-29,Mike Levin) and get on with business as usual.  If someone wants the
 Amiga technology,
(1-29,Mike Levin) this is just another expense which is part of the 
 investment they must make.
(1-29,Mike Levin) GA
(1-74,Mike Smith) ?
(1-22,stephen provost) ?
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Isn't injunction based on cursor ?
(1-29,Mike Levin) I don't know the particular nature of the patent.  I
 heard it might be the..
(1-29,Mike Levin) cursor.
(1-29,Mike Levin) GA
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Gene .. go ahead.

(1-29,Mike Levin) I can't speak for Scala.  Sorry.  GA
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Ottmar.. go ahead.
(1-33,Ottmar Roehrig) Don't you think that the professional Amiga-market
 will discontinue to...
(1-33,Ottmar Roehrig) exist _immediatly_? Which company will buy machines
 which are not being...
(1-33,Ottmar Roehrig) produced and repaired anymore by its maker? Have you
 heard any opinion from...
(1-33,Ottmar Roehrig) third-parties like GVP, Scala, NewTek, ASDG etc.? GA

(1-33,Ottmar Roehrig) third-parties like GVP, Scala, NewTek, ASDG etc.? GA
(1-29,Mike Levin) Unfortuantely, it is a confidence issue...
(1-29,Mike Levin) Sure, there are customers who will not buy computers
 made by a dissolved...
(1-29,Mike Levin) company, but there are also people who care about
 solutions more than...
(1-29,Mike Levin) support, so keep buying those A4000's which are in the
 channels...
(1-105,Endre R Bujtas) ?
(1-29,Mike Levin) And better than that,, write every magazine you know to
 tell them you...
(1-29,Mike Levin) are still buying Amigas, and that you will buy from
 whoever picks up...
(1-29,Mike Levin) the Amiga and that you look forward to the next
 generation Amiga, 
(1-29,Mike Levin) especially now that it has been liberated from management...
(1-25,Tim - GVP, Inc.) ?
(1-29,Mike Levin) this might be optimistic, but it will get some
 attention from potential...
(1-29,Mike Levin) technology investors.  The more optimistic and vocal you
 are,
(1-29,Mike Levin) the better your chances for the next generation Amiga,
 which might still
(1-29,Mike Levin) be something very special.
(1-29,Mike Levin) GA
(1-20,MarkM/MOD)  I am going to re-open the queue for questions.. send 
a ? if you want to ask Mikea question.
(1-22,stephen provost) ?
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Sean.. go ahead..
(1-24, Sean - CD32View) Is the CD32 able to be sold off or would that also

 open to

(1-91,John Brozycki) ?

 be made if some
(1-29,Mike Levin) company sees it as profitable to do so.  It is a 
 long-shot...

 iffy...

 Impossible? (lets buy it!?)
(1-18,John Horton) Follow up ?
(1-29,Mike Levin) The only way the Amiga line as we know it will continue
 is if it is
(1-29,Mike Levin) profittable for a company to do so.  There will be
 studies of Commodore's
(1-29,Mike Levin) operations and profits.  The picture will look grim...
(1-29,Mike Levin) your job is to counter that effect.  Create demand. 
 Write letters...

 want Amigas!

 marketing that ......

 dead? or C= UK or C=
(1-54,Trent Hawkins) Germany?  GA
(1-29,Mike Levin) I was already asked that question.  It's too soon to
 tell.  Only Friday's

 of ANY prospective
(1-29,Mike Levin) plan on finding out and talking to them to make sure 
 they understand

 support A5000toast?

 that by the time
(1-36,Paul Idol) all the liscensing issues and investigations and so on
 are completed the
(1-93,tony butterfield) +++ATH0
(1-36,Paul Idol) Amiga technology will have fallen far enough behind the
 state of things that
(1-36,Paul Idol) potential investors will be less interested in getting
 on board than we
(1-36,Paul Idol) might think or hope.  So things should happen FAST.  GA
(1-43,Willie Schreurs) .sta
(1-114,Andrew Farrell) CEI indicated in their dealer newsletter they
 expected manufacturing to resume soon.
(1-114,Andrew Farrell) Do they know something we don't?  (The newsletter
 was faxed on Saturday) BTW, The
(1-114,Andrew Farrell) level of inventry in the U.K. warehouses will be
 critical to Paul's issue.
(1-29,Mike Levin) These proceedings don't happen fast, unfortunately.
(1-29,Mike Levin) The Amiga already has fallen behind in certain areas. 
 The value of the
(1-29,Mike Levin) Amiga technolgy is not in going up against clones, but
 in...

(1-44,Joe Clasen) Are the big players talking or will they jump ship like
 Golddisk?

(1-118,Amran Vance) [A
(1-44,Joe Clasen) Newtek or will phillips squash the whole thing?
(1-74,Mike Smith) I appreciate all your work Mike, you sound more than
 competent- I'm still
(1-66,larry julien) off
(1-29,Mike Levin) Good question!
(1-124,Steve Thompson) larry, try /x
(1-29,Mike Levin) I think NewTek will look for ways to get the technology.
 How could they not?
(1-29,Mike Levin) more...
(1-29,Mike Levin) I hope Phillips does not try to squash it, but it is a
 possibility.
(1-29,Mike Levin) GA
(1-34,Troy Barlow) Philips

(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Michael Bi.. go ahead.
(1-29,Mike Levin) Ok.   Thanks for the appreciate.
(1-71,Gene Holmerud) ?
(1-52,michael biddle) What about inventory? Are Amiga products available
 anywhere?
(1-38,Steve Setzer) Mike what are your personel feelings about the future
 of C=?  And what kind
(1-91,John Brozycki) ?
(1-29,Mike Levin) Yes.  I can't answer much, but I am led to believe that
 the UK distributors
(1-29,Mike Levin) have stockpiled.

(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Andrew.. go ahed with your comment..

(1-114,Andrew Farrell) According to the CEI newsletter, they have plenty
 of stock (current Saturday)
(1-29,Mike Levin) I hope that they do.  The people at CEI are resourceful.  
(1-29,Mike Levin) GA
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Paul Idol.. go ahead.
(1-3,Don Suhr) ?
(1-36,Paul Idol) I understand your hope that we all buy Amiga products
 and announce 
(1-67,John) con:1
(1-36,Paul Idol) that we WILL buy them and so on, but how do you answer
 questions in the 
(1-36,Paul Idol) minds of buyers to the effect of "Where will we get parts
 and repairs?"
(1-29,Mike Levin) Good question...
(1-36,Paul Idol)  and "Why buy something that won't be upgraded?" and so
 on?  GA
(1-29,Mike Levin) It depends on the supply of parts.  I can only guess
 that part of the...
(1-60,Dean/DKB) !
(1-39,James Scott) !
(1-29,Mike Levin) responsibility of the trustees is to maintain the value
 of the products...
(1-124,Steve Thompson) !
(1-29,Mike Levin) and the market.  This is a hope, but responsible
 trustees should do
(1-29,Mike Levin) what they can to supply whatever parts might still be
 in warehouses.
(1-29,Mike Levin) Again, I admit that there will be a dry period and that
 an Amiga
(1-124,Steve Thompson) The part situation in th US can't be to good, I've
 been waiting 9 monts for
(1-124,Steve Thompson) my HD.
(1-29,Mike Levin) purchase now is only for the brave, but we all eat off
 of the same plate,
(1-23,Greg Knapp) << have a comment on the part/repairs thing
(1-29,Mike Levin) and only that kind of letter will do any good now.
(1-29,Mike Levin) GA
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Dean, your comment?
(1-131,Bob Supak) ?
(1-60,Dean/DKB) When has Commodore ever supplied upgrades to the Amiga
 other than...
(1-36,Paul Idol) !
(1-22,stephen provost) ?
(1-60,Dean/DKB) requiring you to buy a new machine? The third party
 companys have done...
(1-103,Raymond R. Fortier) ?
(1-60,Dean/DKB) more in that respect than Commodore. As for parts, they
 have always been...
(1-60,Dean/DKB) available through the gray market if you know where to
 look!
(1-29,Mike Levin) I agree.  I see opportunity where others see danger. 
 That is the only way
(1-65,John Britton) w3/who
(1-29,Mike Levin) good will come of this.  Commdore has been unhobbled
 the hard way.
(1-29,Mike Levin) Third-party developers must pick up where Commodore
 left off.
(1-29,Mike Levin) And, they haven't actually been liquidated yet.

(1-8,Karl Kugel) Is there anything left at Westchester, and do you think
 work can be resumed on AA
(1-8,Karl Kugel) A?
(1-29,Mike Levin) Only 22 people (I'm told).  They are only likely to be
 there for a 
(1-29,Mike Levin) short while/.
(1-29,Mike Levin) more...
(1-29,Mike Levin) It is so hard to say about AAA, but I am as close to

(1-12,IAM-Dale) !
(1-29,Mike Levin) I guess it is in the hands of whover buys the

(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Dale Larson.. you have the last comment.. then a
 closing statement from Mike.
(1-12,IAM-Dale) Hey, don't people doing COs have to give something away?
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) and one from me.
(1-12,IAM-Dale) What is Levin giving away?  Useless stock?  :-)
(1-12,IAM-Dale) ga
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Thanks Dale. :-)
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Mike, closing comments?
(1-29,Mike Levin) Yes...
(1-23,Greg Knapp) !!!
(1-29,Mike Levin) The tradition of Commodore computers will only continue
 based on your
(1-29,Mike Levin) activities and letters and outcry in the coming weeks.
(1-29,Mike Levin) Let people know this market exist and wants to continue
 to exist...
(1-29,Mike Levin) Where there are customers, there are people who want
 to profit off of them.
(1-29,Mike Levin) Say things like "I would buy an Amiga even if it was
 more expensive"
(1-29,Mike Levin) Dollars talk.  Talk dollars.
(1-29,Mike Levin) Write AmigaWorld and Amazing and your newspaper and
 Forbes and Time and the Wall Street Journal.
(1-29,Mike Levin) Make a story out of this.
(1-29,Mike Levin) Be resourceful in figuring out who to write.
(1-29,Mike Levin) Don't hope for me to pull of some magical stunt.

(1-44,Joe Clasen) Yeah,right.Who will make the Amiga Card Box for the
 IBM/MAC? AMIGA=OSBORNE!
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Ok.. I am going to open the floor for those developers
 who are represented here...
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) who may have a comment.
(1-39,James Scott) !
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) The first comment I have is from Jim Drew/ from Utilities
 Unlimited.
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Go Jim.
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) Nobody freak... but I am willing to put up as much
 money as necessary to obtain the rights to the Amiga.  The Amiga market
 has been good 
(1-29,Mike Levin) There is value in an Amiga Card.
(1-34,Troy Barlow) Joe, better change your password
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) This is still a formal co folks.  Hang in there a sec 
 longer.
(1-50,Jim Menix)  /ust
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) Ahh... woops
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Jim, your line was cut.. re-enter it please.. hit return
 every 60 chars or so.
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) sorry about the length.. 
(1-29,Mike Levin) Hey Jim, attract investors!  Assemble a consortium of 
 Amiga developers.
(1-29,Mike Levin) I could think of no better scenario.
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) Ok.. well, basically I have a staff of attorneys 
 waiting for tomorrow
(1-39,James Scott) !
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) to roll around and see how much it is going to cost
 me...
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) I will be damned if they (HP, Sony, take your pick)
 are going to 'rape'
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) my 'baby' (aka Amiga).  The Amiga market has been
 very
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) generous to us.. time to give some back.  I will be
 talking to other
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) developers to see if a mutual public corporation
 would be in the
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) interest of the Amiga community.  I think the
 developers (us peoples
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) that know the machine) could make this thing fly...
 that's all.  I'm not
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) going to give up on you guys... and to make things
 more interesting..
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) we have MAC products being introduced... and the
 revenue generated from this
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) is going directly into the Amiga community...
 we need this... GA
(1-131,Bob Supak) !
(1-29,Mike Levin) Someone has to spearhead such an effort.
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Any other developer care to comment?
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) I would be happy to.
(1-47,Garry Nelson) Do you think majo/send 105 Would you issue a bond for
 this endeavor?
(1-29,Mike Levin) I think yo're the person to do it.
(1-17,MikeTodd-UK) !!!
(1-60,Dean/DKB) I'll have a quick say.
(1-20,MarkM/MOD)   Go for it dean..
(1-60,Dean/DKB) DKB has every intention of staying available in the Amiga
 marketplace. We...
(1-60,Dean/DKB) have been working behind the scenes to try and obtain a
 supply of machines...
(1-60,Dean/DKB) for the US market. We have not yet been succesfull, but
 if we can do it,...
(1-60,Dean/DKB) we will.

(1-12,IAM-Dale) !
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) Dale?
(1-12,IAM-Dale) Optimism has a valuable place sometimes.
(1-12,IAM-Dale) Whether or not you are optimistic, in the worst case
(1-12,IAM-Dale) the Amiga(s) that you already love/own/use will be
(1-12,IAM-Dale) just as good after the sale of C= as before.
(1-61,Jon Bojicic) ?
(1-12,IAM-Dale) It will still be more cost effective for most people
(1-12,IAM-Dale) to continue to use and upgrade those machines than
(1-12,IAM-Dale) to immediately plunge into a new platform.
(1-12,IAM-Dale) I anticipate a fairly strong market for continuing
(1-12,IAM-Dale) support of the Amiga even in the worst case
(1-12,IAM-Dale) scenario of no more Amigas whatsoever.  Heck,
(1-29,Mike Levin) Good comment!  Let's give a boost to Amiga developers.
 It is exactly what is needed now.
(1-12,IAM-Dale) look at how many people continue to use C64s and
(1-105,Jim Drew/UUI) :-)
(1-131,Bob Supak) !
(1-12,IAM-Dale) to buy stuff for them.  Admitedly, small stuff,
(1-12,IAM-Dale) but those are small machines.
(1-12,IAM-Dale) IAM plans to continue product development and
(1-131,Bob Supak) no
(1-12,IAM-Dale) to make neat new stuff available soon.
(1-12,IAM-Dale) ga
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) AT this point, I would like to thank Mike Levin for 
 being our guest here
(1-20,MarkM/MOD) at CompuServe.  I want to apologize to Dean from DKB as
 he was next in the schedule..

C= posts its latest report (From AP news wire)
    From: Andrew Carol <carol@edfua0.ctis.af.mil>
    Date: 26 Mar 1994 02:06:30 GMT    (4 screens)

I just got this hot off the AP news wire and repeat it
here unchanged.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
AP 03/25 19:16 EST V0155
Copyright 1994. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Commodore International Limited, a pioneer in
home computers, painted a grim picture of its future Friday as it
reported another quarterly loss.
   Commodore warned that, without additional financial help, it
could be thrown into a reorganization or liquidation proceedings.
It is trying to negotiate a restructuring with creditors.
   Commodore made the announcement late in the day after the close
of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Its stock was down 12 1/2
cents to $3 per share.
   The company's net worth turned negative during the fiscal year
that ended last June 30 and it has since had two more quarters of
losses. On Friday, it reported an $8.2 million loss, or 25 cents
per share, for its second fiscal quarter, ending Dec. 31.
   Sales were $70.1 million. A year earlier, Commodore lost $77.2
million, or $2.33 per share, on sales of $237.7 million.
   The company said financial constraints hampered its ability to
supply products, leading to weakened sales.
   Its Amiga CD32 video game machine sold poorly in Europe due to
the bad economy. But the company said sales were stronger for its
Amiga 1200 machine.
   For the six months ending Dec. 31, Commodore lost $17.9 million
or 54 cents per share, compared to a loss of $96.0 million, or $2.90
per share, a year earlier. Sales for the six months were $152.7 million
compared with $396.3 million in the year-ago period.
   Commodore began as a typewriter repair company in the Bronx borough
of New York City 40 years ago. Its extension to the adding machine
business paved the way for it to get make calculators and then
personal computers by the mid-1970s.
   Commodore competed with Radio Shack for the first computers sold
to homes and co-founder Jack Tramiel became a highly-regarded figure
in the fledgling PC industry.
   But Commodore was pushed aside a few years later by the success of
International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. Although
Commodore was quick to adopt some of the popular graphical interfaces
for its Amiga line, far fewer software developers created programs for
its machines than for Apple or IBM-compatibles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Period              Sales     Losses (In millions of dollars, US)
------              -----     ------

2ndQ year earlier   237.7      77.2   (last year, same time)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------8< cut here >8-----------------------

This report came over USENET at the end of March.  (I didn't read it until
after the April issue of the magazine had already been released.)

Commodore's been in dire financial straits before.  When the news started
to trickle in that they were on the rocks again, it went in one ear and
out the other.  The rumors didn't stop and the "good news" we usually
hear from Commodore in the form of a press release or a new product
shipment didn't come.

I'm still waiting for the good news as I write this.  What I've decided
to do with this month's editorial is write a form of journal of
developments and rumors heard throughout the month.  If the news at press
time is good this will serve as a diary of hope.  If the news is bad, let
it serve as a journal of the last days.  (Hopefully, the situation will
have a clear course by the end of the month.)

Commodore News Journal for April:

4/1 - 4/4
---------
Rumors are flying around USENET, Delphi and Compuserve.  No one knows for
sure what is going on.  The Commodore Stockholders Movement has an
appointment with Commodore's creditors on April 4.

4/4 - 4/12
---------
Rumors continue to fly on all networks, but no one has any real information.
A lawsuit from the 1980's takes effect and Commodore US is prevented from
shipping new products.  (Details are sketchy, but someone apparently sued
Commodore, Apple and Microsoft over the blinking cursor.  Apple and
Microsoft paid $2,000,000 each in damages.  Commodore refused to pay and
is currently trying to have the decision overturned.)

4/12
----
A report surfaces that Commodore is being forced to sell out to the
company of their choice by Prudential, their main creditor.  Four
companies are said to be interested, but no one knows who they are.

4/14
----
Another report indicates that Philips has purchased Commodore UK.  Others
believe that Sony is the new owner of Commodore.  Nothing is released by
either company, yet.

4/14 - 4/29
-----------
More rumors, less actual believable content.  Chapter 7 and Chapter 11
bankruptcy are mentioned by some reliable sources.  No one is releasing
any information...yet.  A special conference is called for May 1st on
Compuserve by Mike Levin, leader of the Commodore Stockholder's Movement. 
I have delayed the release of the magazine until after the conference so
as to be able to cover it here.

4/30
----
CNN reports that Commodore is going out of business.  All assets have been
transferred to unidentified trustees for the benefit of creditors.  A full
report is in the news section of this newsletter.  Hoepfully, more details
will be unearthed in the conference tomorrow.

@NODE RUM2 "The SX-1 Module"

As reported in our last two issues, Microbotics are readying a module
that will expand the CD³² into a full computer.  This module, called the
SX-1, is expected to appear in late April or early May.  It will be
selling for $150-$175.  We will hopefully have one to test for the next
issue.

The unit will add a floppy port, RGB port, parallel and serial ports to
the CD³² as well as provide options for adding internal or external hard
drives and a keyboard.  Word is that the unit will not interfere with the
MPEG module, so you'll still be able to watch the Video CD format movies
too. 

No word on how the death of Commodore will affect this product as it looks
like the CD³² is not going to be in production for some time, if at all. 
Without an expanding user base, this product may have a limited lifespan. 
We'll keep you updated.

@NODE NEWS3 "European News"
No new European news to report.  We would have liked to have had a report
on the CeBit show, but we didn't get any submissions.  C'mon, Euroreaders!

@NODE COL1 "CD³² Titles on the Amiga"
Some of our readers own Amigas with CD-ROM drives.  They may be
wondering what CD32 titles will work with their Amiga.  That's what this
column will help them find out.  We'll be testing titles every month
to see if they'll work on any or both of these set-ups:  An Amiga
4000/040 with a Texel DM-3028 and a CDTV (which is basically an Amiga
500 with a built in CD-ROM drive).

It's quite possible none of them will work with the latter system. 
It lacks the AGA chipset that the CD32 contains.  But, knowing that a
lot of people own the older Amigas, we didn't want to ignore them.

This month's games:  SUMMER OLYMPIX, CHAOS ENGINE and FRONTIER: ELITE II

SUMMER OLYMPIX
--------------
It bombs out on the CDTV.  It turns screen yellow on bootup and doesn't
recognize the disc.  When the CDTV is booted with a Workbench disk in
an external drive, the disc is recognized but it has no icons to start
the game.  I did not try to start it with the shell, as I have no
keyboard on my CDTV.

On the 4000/040, the disc showed no icons.  When using the SHOW ALL 
FILES option from the Workbench, icons appeared but none of them would
successfully run the game.

CHAOS ENGINE
------------
Forget the CDTV.  The game uses the AGA chipset and will not work.

And, apparently, forget the A4000/040 too.  It doesn't have any icons
and selecting the SHOW ALL FILES option from the Amiga's Workbench
doesn't produce an icon capable of running the game.

FRONTIER: ELITE II
------------------
When used with the CDTV, the disc does not boot the machine.  It produces
the yellow screen and then stops.  The disc is recognized when the
machine is booted with a Workbench disk, but clicking the icon does not
run the program.  You'll get an error message and that as far as it goes.

On the 4000/040, the icon appears but doesn't appear to do anything when
clicked.  No error or any other message appears.

@NODE COL2 "Hints & Tips"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This month's tips:  MICROCOSM

This tip sent to CD³²View from the INTERNET by
rwx031@btw6x1.oec.uni-bayreuth.de  (Stefan Fischer)

I just read the latest CD^32View, and because there seems to be a MICROCOSM
close to every CD^32, I may have some usefull tips for this game.

1. There are two introduction sequences available, depending whether you hit the
   RED or GREEN button.
2. It seems that Psygnosis has put some music on the CD not used in MICROCOSM.
   Just try track 2 from the game CD on your audio CD player.
3. Sometimes you need to warp back to a junction because you took the wrong
   branch or because of an endless loop you are flying in.
   Just move to the map and place the outlined rectangle to the red mark you
   want to warp to (place it with the YELLOW or BLUE button). 
   To actually warp press the GREEN button while you are on the map.
4. There is a nice and simple cheat, something similar to Senso.
   Press PAUSE after the game startet and try the 4 colored buttons.
   If you hear a higher tone you hit the first button in one of the following
   combinations, now press the remaining buttons.

      GREEN - BLUE - YELLOW - RED - YELLOW- DOWN - GREEN - RIGHT- RED - UP
                                     OR!

     RED - GREEN - BLUE - YELLOW - DOWN - DOWN - BLUE - DOWN - RIGHT - BLUE
                                     OR!
                  YELLOW - RED - GREEN - BLUE - UP - LEFT
                                     OR!
                 BLUE - YELLOW - RED - GREEN - BLUE - LEFT

   You will hear some sound and from now on your life never ends and you have

	   Defender of the Crown II
