@{B}AMIJOE @{UB}REMARKS FROM @{B}MET@BOX@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What "stuns" me ....

We  are very glad to see that our recent announcement of the @{B}AmiJOE G3 @{UB}processor
upgrade  for  the @{B}AMIGA @{UB}contributes not only to the ongoing discussion about the
future  of  @{B}AMIGA@{UB},  but  also  to the design efforts of other companies. Even in
their  approach  towards  potential  customers  and users of such products these
people  have  started  to  think a little more customer-friendly. So, maybe it's
time to release some more educational stuff.

Our @{B}AmiJOE 1200 @{UB}is certainly meant for the majority of loyal Amigans still using
one of the most exciting sub-500-$ computers worldwide. But please note, that we
do  not provide the @{B}G3 @{UB}solution to owners of a customized @{B}A1200 @{UB}built into a big
tower  case.  Our  @{B}AmiJOE @{UB} will  fit into the regular keyboard-style case of the
original @{B}A 1200@{UB}. How do we do that? Engineering!

The @{B}AmiJOE 1200 @{UB}will have an expansion socket for a module also fitting into the
regular  @{B}A  1200@{UB},  offering  either  USB  or, without any difference in price, a
@{B}Fast-SCSII  2 @{UB} -  connector.  This module is part of the @{B}AmiJOE 1200 @{UB}product and
included in the price of 599 EURO.

@{B}AmiJOE  2000@{UB}/@{B}3000@{UB}/@{B}4000 @{UB} will obviously be a little bigger in size, so it has @{B}USB@{UB}
on  board. The @{B}PCI 2.1 @{UB}- compliant connector will be ready to connect to another
expansion  card, the @{B}MultiJOE@{UB}. At this stage, we don't want to disclose too much
information about the @{B}MultiJOE@{UB}, since others should think up their own ideas. We
are  only  going  to  let  you  know  that @{B}MultiJOE @{UB}will offer @{B}Ultra-SCSII @{UB}and a
complete  grafics  system,  which includes 2D/3D, video-in and digitizing, alpha
blending, genlock and flicker-reduction and AC-97-sound.

In  the  last  couple  of  months, we have learned a lot from our microprocessor
partners about @{B}G4 @{UB}and @{B}Altivec@{UB}. The major benefit of the @{B}G4 @{UB}(@{B}PPC 7400@{UB}) will be to
handle  up to 2 Mbyte of Backside Cache. It's some waste of time making 1 MB BSC
solutions  with  the @{B}G4@{UB}, so we will stick to the @{B}G3 @{UB}for now. One important thing
to understand is that this next generation of @{B}PowerPC @{UB}isn't ready to ship by the
time we will start to deliver the @{B}AmiJOE @{UB}to the market. As it becomes available,
there will be another product, too.

@{B}Firewire @{UB} maybe of interest for digital video editors, but it's our clear vision
that @{B}USB @{UB}will bring a broad range of modern peripherals into the @{B}Amiga @{UB}world. On
the  other  hand,  video  work  will  bring  much  fun and productivity with the
@{B}MultiJOE@{UB}, and this will be a turn-key- solution without paying a fortune.

EURO  pricing  is rather new, but makes it very easy for all customers in Europe
and  the  US  to  figure out their ticket into the @{B}G3 @{UB}sphere. We appreciate that
others  will  join  these  practices,  adding  also  more  transparency  to  the
competition.

As we still don't ask for prepayments, it's good to support people who need this
type  of  financials.  And  in  this case, it's very customer friendly to accept
orders  even  without  the  prepayment,  although  they  will have to pay a huge
interest charge on top.

Time will tell about reality.

Your's sincerely

@{B}PHASE5 @{UB}ANNOUNCES THE EXPANDIBILITY OF ITS @{B}G3/G4 @{UB}ACCELERATORS FOR @{B}AMIGA@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

@{B}phase  5  digital  products @{UB} is  excited  to  announce  that  the  next  step in
ground-breaking  technological  progress  will  take  place soon. Since we first
announced  the  @{B}Cyberstorm  G3/G4 @{UB} project  just  10  days ago, the overwhelming
response by the @{B}Amiga @{UB}Community has not only convinced us to extend the original
@{B}Cyberstorm  G3/G4 @{UB}project to an extended @{B}Amiga G3/G4 @{UB}product line. Driven by the
excitement  of  so  many  @{B}Amiga @{UB} users,  we  have spent many hours of additional
consideration  meanwhile,  discussing  the  requests  and  demands  by  the user
community,  and going into technical details and cost optimization. Today we can
present  some  exciting  news,  which  also  make  some of the statements of the
original  announcement  and the update obsolete already. However, if you had not
informed  yourself  about  this  development  before, please read these original
announcements  which  contain  information  about conditions and time frames for
this new product generation.

Following  the  history of world's most established processor upgrade technology
for  @{B}Amiga @{UB} computers, and implementing the experience of the innovator who made
the  @{B}PowerPC @{UB} technology for the @{B}Amiga @{UB}a reality, we at @{B}phase 5 digital products@{UB}
have  also  decided  to make this new technology available to a much larger user
base, and doing what we always did in the past years with our stunning products:
Offer  more value for less money! And that's what we will be doing again - so go
ahead and read about the new additional features at the new lower prices!

@{U}@{I}New models:@{UI}@{UU}

By  introducing  a  second product, the @{B}Blizzard G3/G4@{UB}, we will also provide the
stunning  @{B}G3/G4 @{UB} technology and performance to the users of @{B}A1200 Tower @{UB}systems.
Two models - one with @{B}G3 @{UB}and one with @{B}G4 @{UB}processors - can be ordered now. We are
also now taking orders for the 300MHz @{B}G4 @{UB}version of the @{B}Cyberstorm G3/G4@{UB}.

@{U}@{I}New features:@{UI}@{UU}

All  @{B}G3/G4 @{UB} boards  from  @{B}phase  5  digital  products @{UB} come with @{B}SCSI @{UB}on board -
@{B}UltraSCSI @{UB} on the @{B}A1200 @{UB}versions, @{B}UltraWide SCSI @{UB}on the @{B}A3000/A4000 @{UB}version. Our
proven  @{B}SCSI @{UB} technology,  which  has been providing unmatched performance since
seven  years,  will  provide  full  backwards  compatibility  with existing @{B}SCSI@{UB}
devices.  But  even  more  than that: With the integration of 400Mbit/s @{B}FireWire@{UB}
ports,  all  our  @{B}G3/G4 @{UB} boards  open the door to this future industry standard,
including the world of digital video devices

@{U}@{I}New prices:@{UI}@{UU}

By  proceeding with the related projections and calculations, and going into the
details,  we  have  been  able to determine new and improved pricings which will
make  these  stunning  products  even more attractive. Plus, we have changed the
pricing to EURO (for Europe) and US$ (for outside Europe).

@{U}@{I}New Order & Prepayment conditions:@{UI}@{UU}

In  order  to  proceed  quickly with the finalization and production of this new
product  line, we still require the originally announced quantity of back orders
with  a  prepayment  deposit.  All  customers  who  support our development will
receive  a  major  discount,  as  announced before (please see below for the new
prices  and discounts for the different models). But @{B}phase 5 digital products @{UB}is
also  ready  to  take  orders  now  without prepayment, for the suggested retail
prices  listed  for  the different products. These orders will not be shipped by
@{B}phase   5  digital  products @{UB} directly,  but  forwarded  to  local  dealers  and
distributors.

So far the overview of the major changes in the project. Now here comes the list
of  the  extended  and  updated  new @{B}G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}product line for the @{B}AMIGA @{UB}by @{B}phase 5
digital products@{UB}. Right now, users can choose out of the following four models:

@{U}@{I}A note about Software:@{UI}@{UU}

For the add-on features such as the @{B}SCSI @{UB}interfaces or the @{B}FireWire @{UB}ports, @{B}phase
5  digital  products @{UB} will provide the necessary software tools and drivers, and
also cooperate with other developers. Additionally, we are in negotiations about
licensing useful software to ship with our @{B}G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}boards, and will take care that
support of the upcoming AmigaOS developments is realized.

@{U}@{I}Another note on the prepayment & discount:@{UI}@{UU}

Remember,  the  prepayment which enables you to take advantage of the discounted
price,  will  go  on  a special notary account as announced earlier. The amounts
collected  there  will  not  become  available to us before we actually ship the
products;  they  are  a  deposit  which support our efforts to bring out the new
products for the @{B}Amiga @{UB}which the users have been asking for, thus representing a
partnership  between  the  @{B}Amiga @{UB}community and us in realizing this stunning new
technology for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

If  this  new  list of stunning product offerings includes the @{B}G3@{UB}/@{B}G4 @{UB}model which
you want for your @{B}Amiga 1200 Tower@{UB}/@{B}3000 (T)@{UB}/@{B}4000(T)@{UB}, then do not hesitate but go
ahead and support us in supporting the future of the Amiga by placing
@{B}Your CYBERSTORM G3/G4 or BLIZZARD G3/G4 preorder NOW!@{UB}

@{U}@{I}IMPORTANT:@{UI}@{UU}

If you have already placed an order during the last 10 days, please @{B}DO NOT @{UB}place

ANNOUNCE: @{B}SETDST 1.0@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Hi everyone!

Again  it's  the  time  of  the  year  birds start to collect bunches of nesting
material, the course of the sun reaches higher every day and trees begin to turn
green  again  ~~ in other words: spring break is here! Well, at least as long as
you're living in the northern hemisphere; for those living south of the equator:
have your warm clothes ready ;-)

Anyway,  it is very likely that your local time will change from or to "Daylight
Saving  Time  RSN"  or  it  even  has changed already recently and this is where
@{B}SetDST @{UB}comes in (at last :).

Its  main  task  is to adjust the @{B}Amiga @{UB}system time and the battery-backed clock
for Daylight Saving Time and standard time.

The  first  public  release,  @{B}SetDST  1.0@{UB},  has  been  uploaded to @{B}Aminet @{UB}and it
includes the following features (among others):
  * Can  be  run in the background as a commodity if you wish (for those who run
    their  @{B}Amiga @{UB} 24/7  and  usually don't have to reboot it for days, months or
    even years???).
  * Smoothely integrates into @{B}AmigaOS @{UB}by using current @{B}Locale @{UB}settings to select
    the correct timezone scheme as default behaviour.
  * Is  flexible  enough  to  be  used in various countries and other geographic
    regions.
  * Can use file notifications if you wish to update its behaviour on the fly.
  * Creates  and  manages up to 4 different environment variables to let various
    other  applications  make  use  of the current zone name, GMT offset and DST
    status.
  * It's freeware.

@{B}SetDST @{UB} can  be found in the 'util/time' directory at '@{B}de.aminet.net@{UB}' and should
be  available  on  all currently active @{B}Aminet @{UB}mirrors (hear that, @{B}wustl@{UB}? ;-) as
well.

@{B}SIAMESE SYSTEMS @{UB}ANNOUNCES MULTI-BOARD COMPUTER SYSTEM CASE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}For Immediate Release@{UI}
30th March 1999

@{B}Siamese  Systems @{UB} wish  to  announce  the new 3-Pack multi-board computer system
case.  This  case is designed with our Multi-OS platform in mind and combines up
to  three complete computer motherboards in one strong, space efficient and good
looking  case.  Giving  the ability to run @{B}AmigaOS@{UB}, @{B}Linux @{UB}and @{B}Windows @{UB}all at the
same time.

We  have  designed  this  system  to combine the @{B}Newtek Video Toaster 4000 @{UB}based
@{B}Toaster/Flyer @{UB} system  with a commodity @{B}Windows @{UB}or maybe @{B}Linux @{UB}powered @{B}PC/Alpha@{UB}.
The  @{B}Video  Toaster @{UB}will be controllable from the @{B}Windows @{UB}display. Both of these
can  be  fitted into the 3-Pack case and still have room for an @{B}Alpha @{UB}or another
@{B}PC @{UB} as  a  rendering  system  or  whatever  you  want  from  it.  Any @{B}Amiga 4000@{UB}
motherboard  will  fit  including  any @{B}68k/PPC @{UB}card and we will produce an @{B}A1200@{UB}
adapter if there is a demand.

It  is  made  from  the  same high quality and strong steel constructions as the
@{B}Siamese 8-Pack @{UB}case and is designed to run very cool internally. The case should
appeal  to all those computer users like us who have two or three systems in use
at  once  and  would  like  them  all  in  one  place, and controllable from one
Keyboard,  Mouse  and  Monitor.  Add  to this the cool design and colours and we
believe it looks good too.

Please  take  a  look at our web site at @{B}www.siamese.co.uk @{UB}and then email us for
more details at @{I}steve@siamese.co.uk@{UI}

@node not08 "OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY BY JIM COLLAS: APRIL 1999"

OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY BY @{I}JIM COLLAS@{UI}: APRIL 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This  is my first open letter to the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community. In many ways, I am honored
by  the  opportunity  to  address such a great community of people and represent
such a unique brand as @{B}Amiga@{UB}. There are many remarkable Amigans, both former and
current,  that are responsible for @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s impressive products and its spirit of
revolutionary  innovation. These are the people that created the @{B}Amiga @{UB}phenomena
and the people that persevered through these tough times. @{B}Amiga @{UB}communities from
across  the  world  have  kept  the  @{B}Amiga @{UB} spirit  alive.  I  can't  claim  any
responsibility  for  the  early success of @{B}Amiga @{UB}or the current endurance. I can
only  praise  the people responsible and hope that I can help bring a new era of
greatness to @{B}Amiga @{UB}and fulfill the hopes of the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community.

The  St.  Louis  show  a  few  weeks  ago was the first @{B}Amiga @{UB}show I attended as
president  of  @{B}Amiga@{UB}.  From  the  feedback I have received, the show was a great
success.  The show was well organized with good attendance and was also a lot of
fun.  The  number  of  people  who  attended  was  approximately  1,200 but more
important  is  the  fact  that  there was a 14% increase in attendance from last
year.  I  made  my  debut as president of @{B}Amiga @{UB}and I want to thank everyone who
welcomed  me  to the community. I especially want to thank those who welcomed me
until  3:00  a.m.  in  the morning and taught me that Amigans really know how to
have fun. You know who you are.

In  St.  Louis, I had the opportunity to spend a significant amount of time with
people  in  the  @{B}Amiga @{UB}community. Several times during the show, I publicly made
the statement that the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community is the greatest community in the computer
industry.  I am now more convinced of this than ever. The @{B}Amiga @{UB}community is the
most  innovative,  dedicated,  heroic  and  enduring  community  in the computer
industry.  I  am amazed at what the community has done with little or no support
from a corporate entity. You have endured through extremely tough times and kept
the spirit of @{B}Amiga @{UB}alive and strong.

Unfortunately,  some  of the difficulties the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community has endured in the
last  two  years stem from some misguided decisions made by @{B}Amiga Inc@{UB}. It is now
obvious to me that some very big mistakes were made in defining a path for @{B}Amiga@{UB}
in the last two years. The low priority and support given to @{B}Amiga @{UB}by our parent
company, @{B}Gateway@{UB}, aggravated this situation. @{B}Gateway @{UB}was preoccupied during this
period  with  significant internal restructuring to strengthen its core business
for the future. The intentions relative to @{B}Amiga @{UB}were good but the situation was
mismanaged.  Some  people  have  told  me  that I should stop talking about past
mistakes  and  only  look  toward  the future. I agree with this but I also want
people to clearly understand that I realize how much our past mistakes have hurt
the  community  and delayed progress. This is important because I do not want to
repeat these mistakes so be patient as I discuss this one last time.

In  my  opinion,  the biggest mistake was the decision not to evolve the current
@{B}Amiga @{UB} architecture  as  we developed the next generation. This hurt the current
@{B}Amiga @{UB} community the most. The right decision would have been to overlap product
generations just as @{B}Apple @{UB}did during the @{B}Apple II @{UB}to @{B}Macintosh @{UB}transition. @{B}Apple@{UB}
evolved  the @{B}Apple II @{UB}architecture by introducing the @{B}Apple III @{UB}even after @{B}Apple@{UB}
came  out with the @{B}Mac@{UB}. The @{B}Apple III @{UB}wasn't a big seller but it helped @{B}Apple II@{UB}
hardware  and  software  companies  and  allowed  them  time to transition their
products to the new @{B}Mac @{UB}platform.

In  hindsight  and  from  the  vantage  of the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community, not evolving the
current  architecture  may look like an incredibly stupid mistake but it was not
as  obvious  to  people  coming from the @{B}PC @{UB}industry. I am not trying to justify
this flawed decision but to give some insight as to how such a decision could be
made.  Living in a computer industry dominated by @{B}Wintel PC@{UB}s skewed the thinking
of  people making this decision. In a computer industry dominated by @{B}Wintel PC@{UB}s,
computers  are  obsolete  within  six  to twelve months. The inefficiency of the
architecture  requires  a  continuous  upgrading  of CPUs, graphics, and storage
devices  in  order to deliver acceptable improvements in features and functions.
This  is  what  happens  in  an industry where revolutionary innovation has been
replaced  by  constrained  evolution.  From  this  @{B}PC @{UB}centric view, no one could
imagine  that  a  computer  architecture that stopped evolving in the early '90s
could  have any life left in it. Obviously this view was very limited and flawed
as  the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community has proven over-and-over again how much life was left in
the current @{B}Amiga @{UB}architecture.

It  is obvious that the community would currently be stronger if we had made the
decision  two years ago to evolve the current @{B}Amiga @{UB}architecture. Two years have
now  passed  and we are faced with a tough question. Is there still life left in
the  current  architecture?  I  believe that there is. The release of @{B}O/S 3.5 @{UB}in
late  July  or early August will allow the current architecture to live on for a
few  more  years.  In addition to @{B}O/S 3.5 @{UB}we are looking at supporting companies
that  are  looking at hardware enhancements to the current architecture. We will
also  support emulation of the current @{B}Amiga @{UB}architecture on the next generation
@{B}Amiga @{UB}so that people can use most of their old software. I am spending time with
key  people  in  the  @{B}Amiga @{UB} community  to finalize transition plans between the
current @{B}Amiga @{UB}and the next generation.

Now,  it's  time  to  talk  about  the future! I know this has been an extremely
difficult  and  painful  period  for the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community but I would like to put
that  chapter of the @{B}Amiga @{UB}story behind us and look toward the future. We have a
difficult  road  ahead  of  us  with  many important decisions to be made on our
future  plans.  I will not make the mistake again of not understanding the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community,  its requirements, and its dynamics. St Louis was a good start for me
but  I require even more input to better understand the situation. As all of you
know, the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community is very strong in Europe with many @{B}Amiga @{UB}companies and
extremely  impressive  individuals. I am planning a trip to Germany and the U.K.
in late April to meet with more leaders in the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community. The objective of
my  trip  is  partially to communicate our current thinking but mostly to listen
and  understand.  I  want  to understand the opinions of prominent people in the
@{B}Amiga @{UB} community.  I will use this input to finalize our future architecture and
plans.  I  especially  need help in planning out how we will transition from the
old  architecture  to  the  new  architecture in such a way that keeps the @{B}Amiga@{UB}
community healthy.

One  thing  clearly requested by the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community was BETTER COMMUNICATION on
the  activities  at  @{B}Amiga@{UB}. I promise to improve our communication starting with
this  letter  and  continuing  with frequent postings on our Web site as well as
increased  interaction  with  the  community. Our participation in the St. Louis
show  and  my  upcoming  trip  to  Germany and the U.K. are good examples of our
efforts  in this area. The letter you are currently reading is posted on our Web
site in the new "Executive Update" section that I will personally be updating on
a  monthly  basis.  In  this  section  you  will  also  find  an update on major
activities  listed  after the monthly letter to the community. I think this is a
good start and we will continue improving our communication as we go forward. If
you  have  any  input  on  my executive update web page or on how to improve our
communication please send your suggestions via email to @{I}executive@amiga.com@{UI}. You
can also send email to me directly at @{I}jim.collas@amiga.com @{UI}but I get significant
amounts   of   email   so   it   may   take  me  a  few  days  to  respond.  The
@{I}executive@amiga.com @{UI} email  address goes to my assistant who in turn directs the
email to the @{B}Amiga @{UB}executive that can most effectively reply.

I  know that I have yet to prove my dedication or win your confidence but I hope
to do so over the coming months. As many of you already know, I stepped out of a
senior executive position with @{B}Gateway @{UB}that was a very prominent position in the
@{B}PC @{UB} industry  to lead @{B}Amiga@{UB}. I did this because I believe strongly in what @{B}Amiga@{UB}
stands for. I believe in the @{B}Amiga @{UB}spirit of revolutionary innovation. I believe
that  the  @{B}PC @{UB}revolution is over because innovative revolution has been replaced
by  constrained  evolution. I believe that there is a new computer revolution on
the  horizon,  one  that  will  fulfill  the  promise  of  bringing the power of
computing  to  the  masses.  Most  importantly, I believe that @{B}Amiga @{UB}will play a
significant  role  in  this  new  computer  revolution.  But @{B}Amiga @{UB}can't do this
without  the  full support of the @{B}Amiga @{UB}community. The @{B}Amiga @{UB}community is one of
the  greatest  and most innovative communities in the computer industry. It is a
revolutionary  army  waiting to strike and reclaim its prominent position in the
computer  industry.  I  truly  believe  this  from  the depths of my heart and I
promise to use all of my experience, resources, industry contacts, and energy to
give @{B}Amiga @{UB}a strong and aggressive push. I hope I will not let you down.

Let's keep the momentum going as we come back for the future.

Sincerely,
@{I}Jim Collas@{UI}
President, @{B}Amiga@{UB}

UPCOMING RACING GAME FOR THE @{B}AMIGA@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}Davor  Rivic @{UI} has  sent  me  the  following  snapshots  of the racing game he is
developing  for  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}. For the first time, I include these pictures in the
WEB, because I think it worth showing them.

As  you  can see from the pictures, the game has an excellent look. So far there
is not a working title for the game (what about @{B}Fast Tracks@{UB}?),
The  minimum requirements for the game are @{B}OS3.0+@{UB}, @{B}68030@{UB}/50, @{B}AGA@{UB}, 8 Mb RAM, 6 Mb
HD and joystick.

The  game  is  nearly  finished, so they are looking for a publisher. If you are
interested, please contact @{I}Davor Rivic @{UI}at @{I}davor@usa.net@{UI}.
I  expect to recieve a preview version in a few days, so I will write an article
to tell you how it plays.

other  features  consistent  with  @{B}Unix@{UB}-type  systems.  Developed  under the @{B}GNU@{UB}
General  Public  License,  the  source  code  for  @{B}Linux @{UB} is freely available to
everyone.

This  CD-ROM  contains  the unofficial @{B}RedHat 5.1 Amiga@{UB}-Version (binaries only!)
ported  by  @{I}Jes  Sorensen@{UI}.  The source code is available upon request. Technical
support is provided free of charge via phone (English & German spoken).

The  @{B}Twister G3/G4 @{UB}project for @{B}Amiga 1200 @{UB}is a cooperation between @{B}ACT @{UB}(@{B}Apollo@{UB}),
@{B}Haage&Partner @{UB}and @{B}Titan Computers@{UB}.

@{B}A1200 @{UB} users.  With  a  @{B}Twister  PPC @{UB} board  the  @{B}Amiga  1200 @{UB}will play again in
champions-league  of  powerful  computer  systems.  Old @{B}68k @{UB}times are over a new
RISC-CPU era has begun.

Due  to  @{B}Haage&Partners  68k @{UB} emulation  which  is  fit  in  a  2MB Flashrom the
@{B}Twister-PPC @{UB}board reaches a 100% compatiblity to old @{B}68xxx @{UB}CPU`s.

@{B}AMICOMSYS @{UB}GETS A NEW HOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Hello everybody!

After  eight  weeks  of down time of @{B}amicomsys.tibb.at @{UB}I'm glad to tell you that
there is now a new @{B}AmiComSys @{UB}server to connect to.

It's hostname is @{B}acs.hostile.cx@{UB}
@{B}amicomsys.tibb.at @{UB} is  no  more the home page, so the previous mirror is now the
one and only, that's @{B}surf.to/AmiComSys @{UB}or @{B}amicomsys.home.dhs.org@{UB}. Both URLs goes
to  the  same  home page. @{B}Surf.to @{UB}seems to have server trouble so better use the
@{B}dhs.org @{UB}one!

To change the server host name for @{B}AmiComSys @{UB}do this:
  * Go to the General settings. Select network page.
  * Find the server name setting. Change it to @{B}acs.hostile.cx@{UB}

A new version of @{B}AmiComSys @{UB}should be released within a week ...

Best regards,

Hello.

Just  to  let  you  guys  know,  the  latest  release of @{B}Heretic @{UB}is available at
@{B}privat.swol.de/thomaslorenz/files/Heretic.lha@{UB}

A quick list what has been changed sience last release:

new in @{B}v0.999(9)@{UB}
  * @{B}PPC @{UB}version is much faster now.
  * Close Gadget now works in window mode. Of course it quits the game ;)
  * Added  @{B}Amiga @{UB} Menus. Just press Right Mouse button and see what will happen.
    Works  only  in  Window  mode  so far. Maybe I will add this feature also to
    screen version of @{B}Heretic@{UB}.
  * Fixed HAM6 routine in @{B}68k @{UB}version.
  * Added support for ToolTypes (at least ;) all tool types available are listed
  * New bilinear filtering functions on @{B}PPC @{UB}side. Written by @{I}Noe@{UI}, fast as hell.
  * New transparency code in hicolor (@{B}PPC@{UB}) faster, better.
  * Fixed all 15Bit routines to work in 15bit ;) Some of them (like transparency
    code) was working still in 8 Bit mode.
  * Cleaned  the  code.  Found a lot of code, that was not needed. Removed. Runs
    Faster.
  * At least fixed the 'Exit-Hang-Bug' in @{B}WOS @{UB}version.
  * Added couple of inline assembly functions in @{B}WOS @{UB}version.
  * Added couple of asm optimized functions in @{B}68k @{UB}version.

new in @{B}v0.951 @{UB}(has not been released - I had no time):
  * New  @{B}Venus  Art @{UB}Customers Service started. We now supports both @{B}ppc @{UB}kernels.
    We also have hope, other people will do the same thing.
      * Now you aren't terrorised by @{B}PowerUP/WarpOS @{UB}advocacy.
      * Now you have choice !!!
  * Added @{B}HereticWOS @{UB}executable. Use on your own risk. It has not been tested. A
    lot  of things may not work. If it crashes - don't blame me. @{B}vbcc @{UB}is not the
    best compiler on world, for sure.
  * Fixed Map rendering in hi-resolution.
  * Fixed display routines.
  * title  and  intermissions songs works (I forgot about that - it is available
    from @{B}v 0.89 @{UB}I think)

LIVEWIRE @{B}AMINET @{UB}MIRROR GOES DOWN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

PLEASE NOTE

The  @{B}Aminet @{UB} Archive located on @{B}Livewire @{UB}was lost after a RAID failure. Owing to
the low utilisation, the archive will not be restored.

Access  numbers,  dwindling  CDRom  sales (including not having the time to sell
them  anymore  locally)  plus  space utilisation were the three deciding factors
leading to the decision to not restore @{B}Aminet@{UB}.

I would personally like to than @{I}Urban Mueller @{UI}for his time, help and support (in
the  form  of  CDRoms)  to  enable me to run the mirror for so long. Without the
support @{I}Urban @{UI}gave, @{B}Aminet @{UB}would of disappeared 2 years ago.

Also,  thanks  must also go to Dr. @{I}Greg Perry @{UI}- @{B}GPSoftware @{UB}- for initial support
of  the  Archive.  @{B}GPSoftware @{UB}sponsored the mirror for as long as they could and
got the archive through quite a few tight spots.

Thanks,

@node not22 "MAILING LISTS AT NORDICGLOBAL.COM HAVE BEEN SWITCHED"

MAILING LISTS AT @{B}NORDICGLOBAL.COM @{UB}HAVE BEEN SWITCHED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

From: "@{I}Holger Kruse@{UI}" @{I}kruse@nordicglobal.com@{UI}@{UI}

As   some   of   you   may  have  noticed,  I  switched  all  mailing  lists  at
@{B}nordicglobal.com @{UB} to  a  new  mailing  list  package last Sunday. The lists were
previously  run  on @{B}majordomo@{UB}, and are now running on @{B}listar@{UB}, a new mailing list
package  that is still in alpha state, but offers many additional functions over
@{B}majordomo@{UB},  in  particular for subscribers. @{B}Listar @{UB}is also used by the @{B}VaporWare@{UB}
mailing lists, and @{I}Oliver Wagner @{UI}seems to be very happy with it.

Basic features have not changed: all mailing list addresses remain the same. You
can  also  still  use  "@{I}majordomo@nordicglobal.com@{UI}"  for  commands  to the list,
although  the  new  address  "@{I}listar@nordicglobal.com@{UI}"  is  preferable  now. The
command  format  for  subscribe/unsubscribe  and  other  basic commands have not
changed either.

Most  new  features  are implemented as flags that users can set through mailing
list  commands.  Each  flag  applies to a single mailing list subscription and a
single user only. The commands to set/unset flags are
SET listname flagname and UNSET listname flagname respectively.

You  can get a complete list of flags by sending the "FLAGS" command to the list
server, but here is an overview of the most interesting flags:

    DIGEST

    If  this  flag is set then mail from the mailing list is sent in the form of
    daily  digests,  i.e.  you  only get a single mail per day that contains all
    messages,  plus  an  index.  This reduces email traffic to your account, but
    makes it more difficult to reply to individual mails. If the flag is not set
    (default) then each message is sent to your account individually.

    VACATION

    If  this  flag  is set then mail delivery to your account is suspended until
    you  reset  the flag. Useful if you are on vacation or for some other reason
    unable to read your email for a while. Default: not set.

    ECHOPOST

    If this flag is set then each message you sent to the mailing list is echoed
    back to you. Default: set.

    ACKPOST:

    If  this  flag is set then you receive a short confirmation for each message
    you sent to the mailing list, but the full message is not echoed back to you
    (unless you also set ECHOPOST). Default: not set.

Example:  To  set  your subscription to "miami-talk-ml" to DIGEST mode, send the
command "SET miami-talk-ml DIGEST" to @{I}listar@nordicglobal.com@{UI}.

The  default  for new subscriptions is to only have the "ECHOPOST" flag set, and
all existing subscriptions also have been configured that way.

Other changes that come with listar:

    Subscription  to  a  non-default  email address (e.g. in the form "subscribe
    miami-talk-ml  myother@email.org")  will send you a confirmation ticket that
    you  have  to  respond  to.  Previously  I had to confirm such subscriptions
    manually.

    If  your  account  bounces  email  then  after  a  while  your  account will
    automatically  be switched to VACATION mode (after many transient failures),
    or  you  will  be  completely  unsubscribed  (for  many permanent failures).
    Previously  I  unsubscribed  users manually after a while in situations like
    that.

If  you  have  any  problems  with  the  new  list  server  then  please contact
"@{I}kruse@nordicglobal.com@{UI}".

INTERVIEW WITH MR. @{I}PETRO TYSCHTSCHENKO@{UI}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Date: 31 March 1999
Subject: Interview with Mr. @{I}Petro Tyschtschenko@{UI}
From: @{I}Christophe Heereman @{UI}alias @{I}Toffel@{UI}
Org: @{B}Waaslandia Amiga-Only Club @{UB}(@{B}WAC@{UB})

@{B}Waaslandia Amiga-Only Club @{UB}(@{B}WAC@{UB}), the biggest Belgian @{B}Amiga @{UB}user group, is proud
to present its latest interview... with Mr. @{I}Petro Tyschtschenko@{UI}.

This   interview   was   said   to   be  published  on  3  places  on  the  Net:
@{B}comp.sys.amiga.misc @{UB} and  very  soon also on @{B}titan.glo.be/~waasland @{UB}(the site of
@{B}WAC@{UB}) and @{B}come.to/amigbnl @{UB}(@{B}Amiga Benelux@{UB}). It will also appear in one of the next
club  mags  of  @{B}WAC @{UB} and perhaps in the new and only Dutch Amiga magazine "@{B}Amiga
Scene@{UB}".

The  "author"  is  @{I}Christophe  Heereman @{UI} alias  @{I}Toffel @{UI} and  can  be reached via
@{I}pheerema@xs4all.be @{UI} or  snail  mail/telephone  (see signature below). He and @{B}WAC@{UB}
thank Mr. @{I}Petro Tyschtschenko @{UI}for this interview.

@{U}@{I}QUESTIONS & ANSWERS@{UI}@{UU}

1)  Can you describe the new official structure of @{B}AMIGA@{UB}? Which departments have
been  installed  and  who  is  heading  what?  What  is  @{B}Amiga  Inc. @{UB} and  @{B}AMIGA
International, Inc. @{UB}within the current structure?
@{I}PTY @{UI} :  Of  course.  We  will  be  under  one  roof.  So  @{B}Amiga  Inc @{UB} and  @{B}AMIGA
International, Inc. @{UB}will be unified, which makes a lot of sense. @{B}Amiga @{UB}needs one
direction,  to  be  successful  in  the  future.  Due  to  legal  reason,  @{B}Amiga
International,  Inc. @{UB} will  be  still  a legal entity and I will be the Managing
Director.  I am reporting to Mr. @{I}Jim Collas@{UI}, the President and CEO of @{B}AMIGA@{UB}. @{I}Jim@{UI}
is  located in San Diego, Cal. and I will be remaining in Langen, Germany, close
to  Frankfurt  am  Main. As you can see on our webpage, we have already only one
website, independent if you click @{B}AMIGA.com @{UB}or @{B}AMIGA.de@{UB}.

2)  How  will  the  structure be expanded in the future? Will new departments be
installed? If so, which?
@{I}PTY@{UI}:  To  @{I}Jim  Collas @{UI}are reporting directly 6 Vicepresidents, including myself.
Dr.  @{I}Allan  Havemose@{UI},  he is located in San Jose, Cal. and he is responsible for
O/S  Software  Development  New Generation. We just have hired a System Engineer
for  Technical  Research  and  a  Controller,  responsible  for  all Finance and
Administration.  Both  will  be  located  in  San  Diego. @{I}Jeff Schindler @{UI}will be
responsible  for  Strategy  &  Product  Management  NG, and @{I}Jim van Holle@{UI}, is in
charge  for  Marketing  NG.  Both  are also located in San Diego. As I mentioned
already,  I  will  stay in Langen and will be responsible for the existing @{B}AMIGA@{UB}
Line  (sorry  but I do not like the expression CLASSIC) and will take care about
the  contingency  of  this  great  Technology,  for  licensing  of  the existing
Technology  and  Merchandise Products, for Sales and Distribution worldwide, for
Usergroup  Communication and Support, for the @{B}AMIGA @{UB}Website and for Logistic and
Service.  The plan is to hire in the states minimum 50 people in addition to the
management,  mainly  for  research  and development. You should be aware that an
organisation  is  always a living organism and have to be flexible to the market
needs.  I  think  with  the  existing  Management we have a real strong force to
conquer together the future and to be very succesful as a team.

3)  Are  there  plans  to  install  country departments for other countries than
Germany  and the USA? If so, when will we see @{B}AMIGA UK@{UB}, @{B}AMIGA Belgium@{UB}, @{B}AMIGA The
Netherlands@{UB},...?
@{I}PTY @{UI} :  As  I explained the organisation has to be flexible, and I am quite sure
that  there will be a lot of changes in the near future. If the market is asking
after subsidiaries, please be sure we will install those. I will take care about
this.

4)  Which continents/countries/regions form the main target for @{B}AMIGA @{UB}concerning
the @{B}Amiga-II@{UB}?
@{I}PTY @{UI} :  We  are  an  international  company.  And  we  will  target our products
worldwide.  The  world  gets  smaller  and smaller and we have to acting global.
@{B}AMIGA @{UB}always operated worldwide, we will not change this.

5)  Will  we  see  sport  teams  wearing  @{B}Amiga @{UB} shirts again? Will we see @{B}Amiga@{UB}
commercials  on TV, in papers, in computer magazines,... Can you tell us already
some marketing/publicity/PR plans?
@{I}PTY @{UI} :  We  have  a  big  goal  and  to  reach  this  target we have to act in a
professional  way. We will work out a Marketing Plan for the NG and we will soon
present our new strategy.

6)  Are there plans to contact schools, universities, study centra,... to inform
them of the @{B}Amiga-II@{UB}? Will 'special offers' be provided?
@{I}PTY @{UI} :  Also  that  is a very important move, we will perform. But please do not
forget,  after  two  years  slow motion, unfortuneately, we are just starting to
generate  a  lot of activities driven by @{I}Jim Collas@{UI}. The transition time will be
always critical, but I have no worry we must be successful on the end.

7)  What does @{B}AMIGA @{UB}mean with "in the tradition of the @{B}AMIGA 500@{UB}" when they talk
about  the  low-end  @{B}Amiga-II@{UB}?  The  tradition of quality, revolution, quantity,
sight,...?
@{I}PTY @{UI} :  @{B}AMIGA @{UB}always have had a low end and a high end product. We will continue
this  strategy.  But please watch our new announcements which you can see on our
website  soon.  Our  goal  is  to  create a revolutionary and compelling systems
architecture  and  operating  environment  for  multimedia computers and digital
information  appliances  which  can  easily  be imbedded into consumer computing
devices and enables innovative Internet services.

8)  The  Developer  @{B}Amiga @{UB} will  be  produced by @{B}AMIGA@{UB}. What about the hand-held
Internet  device  and  the  low-end  @{B}Amiga-II@{UB}? Will this be released by @{B}AMIGA @{UB}or
@{B}Gateway, Inc.@{UB}?
@{I}PTY @{UI} :  In  the  current  stage  we are talking with a lot of possible strategic
partners and we will also give soon an answer to this question.

9)  Does  @{B}AMIGA @{UB} plan  to  release  other  products  after  these? Will we see a
tower-based  @{B}Amiga-II @{UB} for  the  people  who  need  a  lot of cards and internal
peripherals?
@{I}PTY @{UI}  :  Please  believe  me  we  are  working  on  a  lot  of  very  intresting
subjects.....but  it  is  to early to talk about this today... Please understand
this.
10) What is true about the rumour that @{B}Sony @{UB}and @{B}Amiga @{UB}are working together? Will
the @{B}PSX2@{UB}, as some people say, be that first @{B}Amiga-II @{UB}game console?
@{I}PTY @{UI} : Rumours, rumours, rumours. Of course, as I mentioned before we have had a
lot  of very intresting discussions with different possible partners, but we are
still in the process of evaluation.

11)  On  @{B}amiga.org @{UB} and different other sites/forums we could read that @{B}Corel @{UB}is
planning  to develop for the @{B}Amiga-II@{UB}. Can you confirm/deny this? What about the
rumours  that  @{B}Adobe @{UB}will join the market too? Are there already other strategic
partners for the moment (except for @{B}QSSL@{UB}) and if so, when will we know them?
@{I}PTY @{UI} :  Here  I  have  to  give  the  same  answer....We  have had a lot of very
intresting  discussions  with very potential companies. But it is toooo early to
talk about this.....

12)  How  do  you  see  the  future  of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}? What is the minimum amount of
@{B}Amiga-II@{UB}s  that  should  be  sold in the first 12 months after the release in 2Q
2000? What does @{B}AMIGA @{UB}expect?
@{I}PTY @{UI} : As you know I never gave up in my live. I always believe in @{B}AMIGA@{UB}, even a
lot  of  people laughed about me. I went through two bankruptcies and never lost
my  faith  in  @{B}AMIGA@{UB}......We  will have a bright future.....the time is ripe for
success....

13)  What  is  your  personal  opinion  about the future? How big do you see the
market in short, middle long, long and very long term? What will be the place of
the @{B}Amiga @{UB}in the computer world?
@{I}PTY @{UI}: I do not have a cristal ball to answer you this question, but what I heard
so  far,  the  vision,  and  what  I have seen sofar, the professionality of @{I}Jim
Collas@{UI},  we will soon have the first success with our @{B}OS 3.5@{UB}, followed by the NG
in November 99. We will be in Cologne in November 99 showing suprises and we are
planning  to  be  in  Las  Vegas at the @{B}Comdex @{UB}this year as well.....We are also
planning to have a @{B}World of Amiga @{UB}in London.

14)  When  @{B}AMIGA @{UB}will be as big (or bigger) than @{B}M$@{UB}, what will @{B}AMIGA @{UB}do when the
court tells you to split the company? :))
@{I}PTY @{UI} :  We  are  not  trying to be a monopoly....we will be a joice...but a good
one....maybe the best. I think we will never have this problem.

(The latest question is a question from one of our club members :))

@{B}TWF @{UB}NEWS UPDATE: 1ST APRIL 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

@{I}#1. General @{B}TWF @{UB}News.#@{UI}

The  website  is going to be updated a bit later today with more information and
for those interested, short bios on each of the @{B}TWF @{UB}members.

@{I}#2. @{B}CEG @{UB}update.#@{UI}

The  Encyclopedia  is  getting a lot more updates over the coming few weeks with
more documents on the different alien races, updates on the alien races and most
of the terran fleet will be finished and displayed in the @{B}CEG@{UB}.

@{I}#3. @{B}Explorer 2260 @{UB}Update.#@{UI}

Currently  development  has been picked up with holidays, etc allowing much more
work  to  be  done  on  the  game.  Anyway the major programming work being done
currently on the game are:
  * single machine client / server communication working for ship systems
  * UDP multiclient network layer being researched.
  * ship  systems  (excluding IIN) working in a matter of a week or so, no major
    problems arising.
  * Physical basis for planetary simulation in place.
  * Sector/  stellar system structure revised to provide greater flexability and
    realism.
  * Player framework in place.
  * Temporal framework near completion
  * Monetary framework in development

Might  not  sound  exciting  but without this strong backbone, the game would be
nothing more than a 3D shoot'em'up. In addition the first of the editor programs
have  been  given out to our developers to create data to be used in the game. A
lot  of  work  is  also  being  done  on completing the graphics for the station
systems. Hopefully a screenshot might be on the website within a week or so.

@{I}#4. @{B}Maim & Mangle @{UB}Update.#@{UI}

Work  has been delayed a bit on the game. Our main programmer was unable to work
on  the  engine as he was away on a well deserved holiday and has just got back.
Also  much  of the 3D work has slowed due to working needed on @{B}Explorer 2260 @{UB}and
@{I}Emmanuel @{UI} working  on  @{B}Phoenix@{UB}.  Hopefully  this  month, a lot more work will be
achieved.

@{I}#5. Next News Update#@{UI}

Next Update: 31st April / 1st May 1999

All the best,
@{I}Ed@{UI}.

LATEST @{B}AMIGA @{UB}NEWS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Article By @{I}Wayne Martin@{UI}

By surprise, @{I}Darreck Lisle @{UI}showed up on IRC today. His purpose was part friendly
hello,  part  fact  finding  mission  for @{B}Amiga@{UB}. As you may already know by now,
@{B}Amiga @{UB} is  very  interested  in what the users have to say, and so have recently
been  seeking input. To start with they have been using polls from @{B}Amiga.org @{UB}for
some  basic  feedback,  one  of  which  was  for  the name of the upcoming @{B}Amiga@{UB}
newsletter  now  called  @{B}Amiga  Insight@{UB}.  Expect to see @{B}Amiga Insight @{UB}on-line at
@{B}Amiga.com @{UB}soon. In the future you will see monthly IRC conferences with @{B}Amiga @{UB}to
make  sure  everyone  is  well  informed with whats @{B}Amiga @{UB}is doing and planning.
Perhaps a preview to such conferences was held today when @{I}Darreck @{UI}gave the users
present the 'lowdown' on the latest @{B}Amiga @{UB}news.

So,  what is the 'lowdown' on @{B}Amiga @{UB}you ask? Well for starters @{I}Jeff Schindler @{UI}is
now  present  at @{B}Amiga@{UB}s new HQ at @{B}Gateway @{UB}in San Diego and @{I}Darreck Lisle @{UI}will be
following  soon.  On  the  topic of @{B}Amiga @{UB}HQ, yes, what we have all been waiting
for...  @{B}Amiga @{UB} will  be  running  a webcam in their offices. Now we get to watch
@{B}Amiga @{UB} at work. As for @{B}Amiga @{UB}R&D building, @{I}Allan @{UI}will have contractors finishing
the internal layout soon.

As  for  more  important  news,  @{B}Amiga @{UB}has met with an industrial design company
called  @{B}Pentagram@{UB}.  With  @{B}Pentagram@{UB}'s  help they will establish the new look and
feel of the @{B}NG Amiga@{UB}s. If your wondering how good @{B}Pentagram @{UB}is, then take a look
at  some  of their recent work here. What can we expect? Five custom cases (each
with  its own design) to start with to show the community. We may even see these
boxes  displayed  at  some of the major trade shows @{B}Amiga @{UB}will be attending this
year.

I hope you enjoyed this small sample of news from @{B}Amiga @{UB}and look forward to more
soon.

WHO WANTS @{B}FUSIONPPC @{UB}AND @{B}PCXPPC@{UB}?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{B}Blittersoft@{UB},  @{B}Microcode  Solutions @{UB} distributors  for @{B}Amiga Fusion @{UB}and @{B}PCx@{UB}, have
published  a  questionnaire  aimed  at determining the market for @{B}PPC @{UB}modules of
@{B}Fusion @{UB} and @{B}PCx @{UB}emulators. It can be stated that there is a very large user-base
of  @{B}Amiga Fusion @{UB}and @{B}PCx 68K @{UB}owners, and we know from personal experience that a
great  many  of  these  people  wish to see @{B}PPC @{UB}modules. However, I am extremely
sympathetic with the views of @{I}Jim Drew @{UI}and @{B}Microcode Solutions@{UB}.

@{B}Blittersoft @{UB} wish to see the @{B}PPC @{UB}modules as much as anyone. We believe they will
both  be  a  great  success. However, many excellent products have been severely
damaging to developers because of poor sales. It is true to say that both @{B}Fusion
PPC @{UB} and  @{B}PCx  PPC @{UB} projects  are  in  progress.  However, it is the market that
dictates  the  priority  of  product,  even  though @{I}Jim @{UI}has stated that the vast
majority  of  the  development is best done on the @{B}PC @{UB}platform. What people must
realise is that if ten people can make a great deal of "noise" in a newsgroup or
mailing  list, think of what 100 or even 500 can make. However, 500 sales is not
going to convince any developer to spend time and effort.

Therefore,  I  urge all owners or prospective owners of @{B}PPC @{UB}board who would like
to  see  @{B}PPC @{UB}modules to fill out this questionnaire. If you have friends without
internet  access,  please  gather  their  details. It would be beneficial to all
concerned  to  gather  this  information.  The  questionnaire  can  be found at:
@{B}www.blittersoft.com/fusppcq.htm@{UB}

THE INTERNET & @{B}OS 3.5@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here  are some more details regarding @{B}OS 3.5 @{UB}as revealed by @{B}Haage&Partner @{UB}at the
@{B}AUGS@{UB}-Meeting.

@{I}Internet@{UI}:

  * A  special  version of @{B}AWeb @{UB}will be the Browser and the TCP/IP-stack will be
    @{B}Miami@{UB}.   Integrated   Network-support.   The   E-Mail-API   and  the  simple
    E-Mail-Client will be from the author of @{B}Voodoo @{UB}and @{B}New York@{UB}.

@{I}@{B}Workbench@{UB}@{UI}:

  * It  wouldn't be necessary anymore to use the Shift-Key when moving more than
    one  icon.  An  "Unselect"  will  be  possible  when  more  than one icon is
    selected.  All  Preferences-Programs  will get the new @{B}Reaction@{UB}-surface. The
    Submenus of the @{B}WB @{UB}will be optimized for a better handling.

@{I}Icon Library@{UI}:

  * When  selecting,  the  icons will start to "glow" when dragging them they'll
    get  semi-transparent.  Via the "Info"Option it will now also be possible to
    set  the  process-priority.  The current and the @{B}NewIcons @{UB}will be supported.
    The @{B}AppIcons @{UB}will now be able to be animated.

@{I}Reaction@{UI}:

  * The   Tool   @{B}Reactor @{UB}  will   enable   software-authors   to   use  the  new
    @{B}Reaction@{UB}-surface  with their own software. One of the highlights of @{B}Reaction@{UB}
    is  the  possibility to have a color-gradient in the background of a window.
    Also bugs in the "asl.library" will be removed.

@{I}PowerPC@{UI}:

  * @{B}WarpUp @{UB} will be integrated in it's latest version. An important part will be
    the Preferences-settings which will complement the integration.

@{I}Installer@{UI}:

  * The  installer  will  be able to be opened on an own screen. This screen can
    have  a  color-gradient.  New  will  be the possibility to go steps backward
    during installation.

@{I}Printers@{UI}:

  * The  printer-support  will be redesigned completely, so that 24-bit-printing
    will  be  possible  on  the @{B}WB@{UB}. @{B}CyberGraphX @{UB}and @{B}Picasso96 @{UB}will be supported.
    There will be only one Printer-Setting in the future, which will also have a
    preview-window showing immediately the changed settings.

@{I}Datatypes@{UI}:

  * Reworked  and improved, now also 24-bit-capable. New are datatypes for @{B}AIFF@{UB},
    @{B}JPG @{UB}and @{B}GIF@{UB}. Complete rework of the @{B}Amigaguide-Datatype@{UB}.

The  documentation will be in HTML in German and English (and hopefully in other
languages  like  Spanish, French, Italian, Swedish, etc.). Release date is still
August.  First Beta-Tests will start in 3 weeks. @{B}AmigaOS 3.5 @{UB}wil be delivered on
CD-ROM for 99,50 DM.

RECRUITING PEOPLE FOR @{B}PORTRAIT @{UB}DEVELOPMENT TEAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From: @{I}Chris January@{UI}, @{I}jasmine@usurper.freeserve.co.uk@{UI}

@{I}FOR INMEDIATE RELEASE@{UI}

Hi all

A few months ago I released on @{B}Aminet @{UB}and @{B}Amiga Format @{UB}cover CD a program called
@{B}Portrait@{UB}. This is a 24-bit paint package which I was developing at the time. The
planned feature list is still as long as my arm and I have made little ground in
moving  the project on. After looking at the main problem of stability I decided
to  rewrite  the entire code from scratch. Although the engine is now working, I
now  need  to  add in all the features that were there before, and so on. In the
end  I  decided  it  was  all  too  much  for one man! So, here I am looking for
programmers  who  wish to come aboard the project. Basically anyone who can help
me in the following areas please contact me:
  * Experienced @{B}Amiga E @{UB}programmers.
  * Programmers who can convert @{B}E@{UB}@{B}C++ @{UB}and vice versa.
  * Experienced @{B}C++ @{UB}programmers.
  * @{B}Java @{UB}programmers.
  * @{B}Win32@{UB}/@{B}C++ @{UB}programmers.
  * Language translators.
  * Project coordinator.
  * Source code afilliator.
  * Graphics artists for example artwork.

I'm currently planning versions for:
  * @{B}Amiga/AmigaOS@{UB}
  * @{B}NetBSD/X-Windows@{UB}
  * @{B}Win32@{UB}
  * @{B}Java VM@{UB}

But I can only achieve this with _your_ help.

I  would also be grateful of people who could host websites/source code archives
to  help  with the project. Basically contact me if you are at all interested or
have  any  ideas.  Download  the  last  version  from  @{B}Aminet @{UB}from 'gfx/edit' or
something  like that. (Beware - it is very unstable - the version on @{B}Aminet @{UB}even
fails to run on my machine! - goodness knows why I ever uploaded it :-)

I  would  really  like  this  to  be  something that everyone can contribute to.
Perhaps, together, we can even make it tommorrow's killer app.

Basically the idea is to write something that is sort of a mixture of @{B}Paint Shop
Pro/Personal  Paint/Photogenics @{UB}and @{B}ImageFX@{UB}. I want to take the idea of pixel by
pixel editing possible in @{B}Personal Paint @{UB}into the 24-bit/32-bit world (ARGB) and
combine it with all the familiar techniques.

Thank you all and hope to hear from you soon,
@{I}Chris@{UI}

@{B}BEST POWER @{UB}TO SUPPORT @{B}AMIGA@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From: @{I}Jamie.Krueger@bestpower.gensig.com@{UI}

@{B}Best  Power @{UB} WILL be supporting the EXISTING @{B}Amiga @{UB}line with the next release of
our  @{B}UPS @{UB} monitoring  and  control  software,  @{B}CheckUPS II v3.3@{UB}. We will also be
supporting  the  next  generation  of @{B}Amiga @{UB}machines as they become available. I
recently attended the @{B}Amiga '99 @{UB}show in St. Louis, where I made the announcement
at  the @{B}ICOA @{UB}Developers meeting, that Best Power was going to support the @{B}Amiga@{UB}.
I was very pleased with the overwhelmingly positive response I received.

While at the show, I opened a dialog with @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB}'s new president @{I}Jim Collas@{UI},
as  well  as @{I}Juergan Haage @{UI}(@{B}H&P@{UB}'s Managing Director of the @{B}AmigaOS 3.5 @{UB}project),
about  adding direct @{B}UPS @{UB}(Operating System Shutdown) support into @{B}AmigaOS 3.x @{UB}as
well  as the new @{B}AmigaSoft 5.x @{UB}Operating Environment. Working with @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB}, I
believe  that @{B}Best Power @{UB}can provide a greater level of @{B}UPS @{UB}connectivity for the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}, then has been achieved on any other OS to date.

In  addition  to  providing @{B}UPS @{UB}support for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}, @{B}Best Power @{UB}will be making
another  first  in the @{B}UPS @{UB}industry by releasing it's in-house @{B}UPS @{UB}driver API as
OPEN SOURCE!

The @{B}CheckUPS SDK@{UB}, a full Software Development Kit for writing serial and network
based  @{B}UPS @{UB}monitoring software. Based around the "@{B}Best Power UPS @{UB}Driver API", it
will provide a very easy means of writing custom software that communicates with
any @{B}Best Power @{UB}model @{B}UPS@{UB}, without having to know anything about the specific @{B}UPS@{UB}
communication  protocol. Also, as Best releases new @{B}UPS @{UB}models, it will continue
to  update  the @{B}SDK@{UB}, thereby making adding support for a new @{B}UPS @{UB}to any software
written using the @{B}CheckUPS SDK@{UB}, as easy as recompiling or downloading the latest
shared library.

Considering  the  fact  that  the  @{B}UPS @{UB}Driver API was delevoped excluively on an
@{B}Amiga  A4000T@{UB}, (the same machine that creates our CDROM masters), it seemed only
fair to directly support the @{B}Amiga @{UB}:-).

Of  course,  the thing everyone wants (esspecially the ones asking for "@{B}Java@{UB}" :)
I've  implemented  the  @{B}Javascript 1.2 @{UB}core language with a nicely-done bytecode
interpreter.  @{B}Voyager @{UB} first  compiles  the  code down into a special P-Code (or
"Bytecode"  as  it's  nowadays  called,  although  it  really consists of 16 bit
instructions)  which is then executed by a special interpreter. This should give
the  fastest  @{B}JS @{UB}implementation available in the industry, and should especially
help  with  the  otherwise  massive  impact  of  event  handler  code or looping
operations.

The  Document  Object  Model I'm implementing is closely based on the one of the
@{B}Microsoft  Internet  Explorer@{UB},  because it is much more flexible than that of @{B}NS@{UB}
(that's what @{B}M$ @{UB}calls "Dynamic HTML"

@{U}@{I}HTML@{UI}@{UU}

Numerous  major and minor updates. Support for CSS 1 is being worked on and will
most  likely be ready in time. Note that "Dynamic HTML" is actually a @{B}JS@{UB}-related
issue.

Status: done, in testing stage, gathering real-world feedback now

@{U}@{I}GUI@{UI}@{UU}

Main GUI is now completely customziable with the well-known "coolbar" technology
borrowed  from  the  @{B}Windows @{UB}world. Bookmarks are replaced with the new embedded
version of the @{B}Contact Manager@{UB}. New @{B}IE4@{UB}-alike history allows finding

@{U}@{I}Networking@{UI}@{UU}

Cache   system   has   been   reworked  to  require  less  maintaince.  Optional
"blacklisting" for image fetching based on URLs allows one to get rid of banners
and <IMG> based tracking services. The same will probably be added for cookies.

Status: mostly done

@{U}@{I}@{B}Java@{UB}@{UI}@{UU}

The  "@{B}Merapi@{UB}"  @{B}JavaVM @{UB}seems to have died. @{I}Holger Kruse @{UI}of @{B}Nordic Global @{UB}recently
announced the @{B}Daytona JavaVM@{UB}, and has invited all browser authors to participate
in a design discussion about a potential plugin API for @{B}Daytona@{UB}. If this project
has  a  future  (and  given  @{I}hkr@{UI}'s track record, it surely will), I'm definitvly
going to support it.

Status: time will tell

@{U}@{I}@{B}Flash/Shockwave@{UB}@{UI}@{UU}

@{I}David  "Zapek" Gerber @{UI}@{I}zapek@vapor.com@{UI} @{UI}is working on integrating the free @{B}flash 3@{UB}
player as an @{B}V @{UB}plugin.

Status:  being worked on. It's either finished in time or someone in Switzerland
will have his buttock prodded :^)

@{U}@{I}Image decoders@{UI}@{UU}

Updated  to  current  versions  of libjpeg and libpng. Speed improvements in the
rendering  code, and will now also deal fine with @{B}CGFX4 @{UB}in-buffer bitmaps. Fixed
tons  of low-memory issues. Modularized and loaded on demand based on the system
architecture  for maximum efficiency with easy upgrading to @{B}PPC@{UB}. Special support
for @{B}FBlit @{UB}on @{B}AGA @{UB}systems to totally eliminate the need to use chipmem.

Status: done, in testing stage

@{U}@{I}Plugins@{UI}@{UU}

Nothing really done yet, but the @{B}Flash @{UB}player is being designed as an plugin and
will stirr up some required changes.

@{B}WARPUP RELEASE 4 @{UB}NOW AVAILABLE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The  release  4  of  @{B}WarpUP @{UB} mainly  features  numerous enhancements, which were
desired  by  developers  so  that  they can work on their projects as easily and
efficiently  as  possible. It is to be expected that quite soon software will be
released requiring @{B}WarpUP 4 @{UB}to be installed.

@{B}WarpUP 4 @{UB}also wants to build a bridge across different worlds. With the addition
of  the  @{B}PowerUP @{UB} Emulation  of  @{I}Frank  Wille @{UI}the possibility is provided to run
@{B}PowerUP @{UB} applications  under @{B}WarpOS@{UB}, so that even these applications can benefit
from  the  outstanding multitasking capabilities of @{B}WarpOS@{UB}. The enclosed version
already supports the new features of @{B}WarpUP 4@{UB}.

@{I}Most important news@{UI}

  * The  memory  management  of  @{B}WarpOS @{UB} was completely replaced. The new memory
    management  is  about  factor  4-5 faster than the old one, this means, that
    applications  which  intensively allocate/deallocate memory using the @{B}WarpOS@{UB}
    functions  will  benefit. Thanks a lot to @{I}Frank Wille @{UI}for the implementation
    of the new memory management.

  * Together  with  the  new  memory management a pooled memory API is provided,
    which is identical to the corresponding API of exec.

  * The semaphore features of @{B}WarpOS @{UB}were enhanced much. Now 'shared semaphores'
    and message based semaphore obtaining/releasing are supported.

  * Now  the meaning of the task signals can be changed using 'SetExceptPPC', so
    that  an  exception  handler  is  executed,  if  such a signal is sent. This
    function  corresponds  to  the  appropriate  exec  function  with some minor
    difference (which certainly is documented in the autodocs).

  * Now it is possible to add interrupt handlers to @{B}WarpOS@{UB}, which can be invoked
    both  by  the  @{B}PPC@{UB}-  and  the @{B}68K @{UB}side. With that a new way of communication
    between  @{B}68K @{UB} and  @{B}PPC @{UB} is  provided,  which  will  be  important  for  some
    specialized applications.

  * In  the past it was quite painful to make sure, that new tasks started using
    'CreateTaskPPC'  get the r2 of their mother task (which means, that they can
    access  the  mother task's variables). Now a new flag was added, which makes
    it very easy to achieve the same result.

  * The creation of @{B}PPC @{UB}tasks from the @{B}68K @{UB}side was made easier by providing the
    function  'CreatePPCTask'.  This  function  itself  calls  the  @{B}PPC @{UB}function
    'CreateTaskPPC'.

  * A  new  env  variable  'powerpc/seginfo' enables a new debugging capability.
    Whenever a task crashes, segment information (hunk/offset pairs) are printed
    out  to  sushi  resp. the serial interface. These information can be used to
    identify  the location of the command which caused the crash. If desired the
    whole stackframe is scanned and all locations of higher-level function calls
    are  also printed out. This new feature requires the 'segtracker' tool to be
    installed.

  * The  installer  of  @{B}WarpUP  V4 @{UB} was  revised and made more secure. Now it is
    almost  impossible  to  install  @{B}WarpUP @{UB} the  wrong  way,  because  most env
    variables  can't  be  configured anymore using the installer. These variable
    are set in a way which should care for maximal reliability.

@{I}Most important bugfixes@{UI}

  * A  problem  with  the terminator 2 was fixed, which could lead to @{B}WarpUP @{UB}not
    starting on some @{B}BlizzardPPC @{UB}systems.

  * The  famous  'ramlib'  problem  was again improved. Again it should be noted
    that  these  'ramlib' problems only can appear when @{B}PPC @{UB}shared libraries are
    used  (since there are still people around which see this issue as advantage
    of @{B}PowerUP @{UB}but forget, that there are almost none @{B}AMIGA@{UB}-OS compatible shared
    libraries for PowerUP available).

  * There  was  a  quite  severe  bug  in  the  scheduler,  which  could lead to
    multitasking hang-ups in some special situations. This is corrected now.

  * The   function   'FreeVecPPC'   sometimes   could  trash  several  registers
    (especially when freeing large amount of memory). This is corrected now.

@{I}Software/Tools@{UI}

  * In  the  @{B}WarpUP  4 @{UB} distribution  the  @{B}PowerUP @{UB} emulation  of @{I}Frank Wille @{UI}is
    provided.  The core of this emulation is a 'ppc.library', which, in contrary
    to  the original 'ppc.library' of @{B}Phase5@{UB}, works under @{B}WarpOS@{UB}. This way it is
    possible  to  run  @{B}PowerUP @{UB} applications under @{B}WarpOS@{UB}, in parallel to @{B}WarpUP@{UB}
    applications.

    The  current version of the @{B}PowerUP @{UB}emulation is @{B}V0.6 @{UB}and it requires @{B}WarpUP
    4 @{UB}('powerpc.library V15').

    It  is  strongly  recommended  to  read  the corresponding text files in the
    directory  'PowerUPEmu',  to  make the software working correctly and to get
    aware of all restrictions (mainly concerning compatibility).

    IMPORTANT:  the  @{B}WarpUP  V4 @{UB} installer  always  sets the terminator variable
    'powerpc/terminator'   to  2.  This  setting  leads  to  the  best  possible
    reliability of @{B}WarpOS @{UB}itself, but has the effect, that the @{B}PowerUP @{UB}emulation
    and  @{B}WarpOS @{UB} don't work together anymore. @{B}CyberStormPPC @{UB}users should set the
    variable to zero, if the @{B}PowerUP @{UB}emulation should be used. @{B}BlizzardPPC @{UB}users
    have a more difficult job (thanks to the Flash ROM) and should read the file
    'PowerUPEmu/README'.

  * In  the  directory 'tools/BPPCFix' there is a tool (again from @{I}Frank Wille@{UI}),
    which  allows  to  reboot  a  @{B}BlizzardPPC @{UB} based  system  in a way, that the
    'ppc.library'  is  not  started  anymore after reboot. This leads to a major
    improvement  of  the situation for the @{B}BlizzardPPC @{UB}users, because they don't
    have  to  use  the  dirty  termination  procedure  anymore  to launch @{B}WarpUP@{UB}
    applications.    For    more    information    please    read    the    file
    'tools/BPPCFix/BPPCFix.readme'.

  * In  the  directory  'tools' there is the program 'WarpStat', which shows the
    load  of the CPU and of the different task using a graphical user interface.
    This program requires @{B}MUI@{UB}.

@{B}WORLD OF AMIGA '99 @{UB}- IT'S GOING AHEAD!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{B}PBA Events @{UB}in association with @{B}AmigaSoc UK @{UB}are pleased to announce that the most
eagerly awaited @{B}Amiga @{UB}event on everyone's calendar is going ahead. The show will
be on the weekend of 24th and 25th July.

Many  people  have expressed the need to host the UK's premier @{B}Amiga @{UB}event at an
alternative venue. Although the Novotel was selected for reasons of tradition in
the  past,  the  time has come to break with tradition and go for something new.
This  year,  we'll  be holding the event in a prestigious Kensington venue which
we're sure you'll agree is a huge improvement over the Novotel!

In addition to the usual things people have come to expect from the show, we are
aiming  to run a number of other events within the show. These will be organised
with  the  help  of  UK user groups, so you can guarantee that the place will be
brimming with @{B}Amiga @{UB}experts with brains just waiting to be picked!
  * Games  competitions:  @{B}Amiga @{UB} multi-player  games  are getting better all the
    time.  Now's  your chance to play them with loads of other people... and you
    might even win a prize!
  * An  @{B}Amiga @{UB} cybercafe: If you're not on the Internet already, see how easy it
    is to get your @{B}Amiga @{UB}connected!
  * Seminars:  Following  on  from  last  year's  hugely  successful  series  of
    seminars,  we'll  be  getting  leading @{B}Amiga @{UB}people to make presentations on
    various  subjects (if you'd like to hold a seminar, get in touch with @{I}Andrew
    Elia @{UI}at @{I}andrew@uk.amigasoc.org @{UI}now).
  * How-to  sessions:  If  you're  in  any  doubt as to the best way to go about
    towering  your  @{B}A1200@{UB}, or getting on the Internet, @{B}Amiga @{UB}experts from around
    the  UK  will show you how (if you've got any ideas for potential workshops,
    then  contact  @{I}Andrew  Elia @{UI} at the above adress or use the forms soon to be
    available on our website).
  * Shareware  registration:  Your  chance  to  register  some top quality @{B}Amiga@{UB}
    software without all the hassle of sending money to far off places.
  * A  user  group  hospitality  area: Those that are members of registered user
    groups  can  relax  in  a  private and informal atmosphere while getting the
    chance to hobnob with @{B}Amiga @{UB}celebrities from around the world.
  * Stands for user groups: If you're not a member of a user group, then you can
    come  along  and  meet representatives from your nearest group. On the other
    hand,  if  you're  a  user  group  and you'd like to take the opportunity to
    recruit  some more members, then the @{B}WOA @{UB}show is the perfect place to start.
    If  your  user  group wants a piece of the action, E-Mail @{I}Chris Livermore @{UI}at
    @{I}chrisl@uk.amigasoc.org@{UI}.
  * The inimitable @{B}Annex@{UB}: Get autographs and kisses from @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s own pop group!

Undoubtedly,  one  of the most exciting things happening at the show will be the
launch  of  @{B}OS  3.5@{UB}. All being well, this product should be launched at the show
and  will  be  on  sale.  You  won't  get  another chance to try before you buy!
Additionally,  the  next  generation  @{B}Amiga@{UB}s  are just around the corner, so you
never know what else you might see!

The  @{B}1998  AAA  awards @{UB} will also be presented at the show, so you can see first
hand who will be collecting this year's international award as well as the first
ever @{B}UK AAA @{UB}award.

The official @{B}World Of Amiga @{UB}website is already on-line. All the latest news will
be  posted  here.  We are currently in the process of updating it to include all
the  information  visitors to the show could possibly need, including details of
hotels,  a  map  of  the  venue,  our  growing  list of exhibitors, and any news
relating  to  the  show  as it becomes available to us. We also hope to offer an
on-line  ticket  ordering  system  courtesy of @{B}IMM Studios@{UB}. If there's something
else  you  feel  we  should  provide  through the site then drop us an E-Mail at
@{I}andrew@uk.amigasoc.org@{UI}!

Be in no doubt, this show has got the full backing of @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

Tickets  will  be priced at £7.50 for adults, and £5.00 for under 14s. This year
we will also be offering special rates for families. Two adults and two children
(under  14) enter for only £15.00! Additionally, for people wishing to attend on
both  days of the show, there will be a special booth on Saturday that will sell
tickets to existing ticket holders for Sunday's show for a mere £2.00 (£1.00 for
under 14s). There will also be a number of tempting door prizes. Details will be
made available on @{B}www.worldofamiga.com@{UB}.

As  far as exhibitors are concerned, we are aiming to provide a competitive rate
this   year,   and   will   also   be   offering   special  low-cost  tables  to
companies/organisations  who  are on a tight budget. In short, we want to please
everyone!

You won't want to miss it!
