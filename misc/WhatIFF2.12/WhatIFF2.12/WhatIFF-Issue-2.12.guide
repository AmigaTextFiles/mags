============================================================================

As I sit here and write this I am sitting on a brand new chair, it is thanks 
to my wife's help that I was able to buy a used company chair, which are 
generally much more expensive than the ones sold on Amazon. While I have 
lived in Japan for over 17 years and learnt the lanuage up to a point, 
there is still much to learn and I will inevitably need the help my Japanese 
wife can provide. I see WhatIFF? in much the same way. While there are the 
Amiga users who have used their machines non-stop and are now Amiga wizards, 
there are others who are new to the machine, those who are returning or 
those who just need some help in recalling how to do something. WhatIFF? is 
here to help them use their Amiga better be they a new user or experienced 
user, I hope that WhatIFF? can be of help to them much like my wife has 
been a help to me when I struggle with Japanese.

This issue has some great features with some more guides on using the 
verstatile PiStorm, fixing booting errors with the A314-CP, creating 3D 
graphics with a word processor and more. We have a look at two RGB2HDMI
solutions and the latest version of the Furia. Ivan Sorensen takes us on a 
philosophical journey with the Amiga and also has some time to fit in some 
game reviews. Finally but not least we have interviews with Andy Vaisey the 
developer of the game Spheroid and who has also given us as an exclusive 
Xmas demo with 15 levels, Rob Cranley the creator of DrawerGenie and Migel 
Fides, creator of the Trinity accelerator card. And that is not all but I 
do want to keep you, so before I wrap up I just want to thank all the 
writers and contributors over this year. The magazine has grown into 
something very special thanks to your hard work. Finally thank you to 
everyone who has downloaded and read the magazine, it means a lot to hear 
your comments. Right, now I am finished! Enjoy reading the magazine and 
also don'T forget to play the Xmas demo of Spheroid, hopefully it will take 
you back to days of Amiga and winter holidays.

@{b}Shell Talk@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul} 
============================================================================

Unfortunately we have not got all of our writers back on board since we 
changed from a Discord channel to a forum. So for this issue I will be 
taking over Shell Talk. And what I want to talk about is going to be quite
controversial, the PiStorm. First off I want to say that I love the PiStorm
is has made my Amiga into a super Amiga with speed beyond my imagining, RTG
support on the A1200 and hopefully networking in the future. However I had
a strange moment recently that caused me to put the PiStorm away back into
its box and put my TF1260 back in again.

About two weeks ago I was having a look at the DarkForces Amiga conversion
and was about to have it up and running on my Amiga. At the time I had the
PiStorm installed and the Amiga was flying through everything like usual.

Once the game was loaded and I started to play for a few moments, after a
short while I stopped and realised that something was missing. Usuall when
I play a 3D game or something that has been ported to the Amiga, I am
impressed. But this time there was no 'Wow!' moment, it just felt as it 
should. It then struck me that the way I viewed my Amiga now was differently
with the PiStorm installed. With the PiStorm I know that the main driver of
the CPU is a brand new RaspberryPi that is many more times powerful than any
Amiga ever made. With this also came the notion that the Amiga will of 
course be fast enough to play the game, there will not be any slow down as
my Amiga is running at something like 1.4ghz. This knowledge that my Amiga
can power through anything because it has a modern mini computer inside took
away the 'fun' element of using the Amiga. It became in other words and an
emulated Amiga and with that notion the idea that it should be able to do
anything now.

I decided to swap the PiStorm for my TF1260 and tried DarkForces again and 
it was a different experience. Most likely I did not expect or know the 060
will fly through everything as it is not a modern processor. It made the
surprise of DarkForces running well a more enjoyable experience. I do not
want to take anything away from what the PiStorm has achieved and does but
I realised it has taken some of the magic away, for me at least, of using
an Amiga. Saying that,if I had another A1200 I would put a PiStorm into it
but as I have only one A1200 the TF1260 provides a more fun and surprising
Amiga experience.

How do you feel when you run a taxing game or application with a PiStorm
vs a 'real' CPU?

@{b}Review@{ub}

The humble A600 has not had much love from WhatIFF? over the last two years
so I thought with this being our 2nd year it is time to put the A600 in the
limelight. In this review we will be looking at two varients of the RGB2HDMI
adapter: PiggyBackNot V3 and the standard board. 10 years ago I had my A600
connected to an Indivision ECS via the expansion port, this card worked
flawlessly and gave a great picture even though it was from the VGA port.

Sadly as is per usual for an Amiga user, the A600 was sold off to pay off
for some other Amiga hardware and now having obtained an A600 again I am in
the position of needing a way to get video out from my A600. While I would
like to use an Indivision again, they are very hard to come by and do not
offer the more common HDMI connector. So the RGB2HDMI seemed perfect.

What you need to consider when buying one first is if you have or want to
have an accelerator/extra ram in your A600. If so then your only choice is
the PiggyBackNot V3 or the other varients that have the flex cable. So to
begin with, let{s have a look at the PiggyBackNot V3.

@{b}PiggyBackNot V3@{ub}

Unlike the "standard" RGB2HDMI adapters the PiggyBackNot V3 from now on, 
PBNV3, does not have the Pi sitting on or close to the Denise. Instead in
a nod to the Indivision, it has the Pi sitting on a board plugged into the
expansion trapdoor port. This has the added benefit of giving you more 
space in the A600, better support for the Pi and less pressure on the Denise 
chip. The board also provides 1Mb extra chip ram, 3 clockports, a realtime 
clock chip and battery slot (Be careful how you orient the RTC chip or you
risk damaging the board). The board connects to the Denise via a flex 
cable, the adapter sits snuggly onto the Denise and clips in with a 
satisfying click. It should be noted that the connectors are not very strong
unlike the Indivision AGA, so if you remove the board more than two times it
is highly likely the adapter lose it{s tightness and you will not get a 
picture. This unfortunately happened to me when I was testing both boards.

The great part of this design, is that it allows you to add any accelerator 
or memory expansion card that goes over the CPU but it also makes for a 
fragile design. The flex cables are very thin and the connectors between the 
Denise adapter and HDMI can be easily broken. I suggest using a magnifying 
glass or if you wear glasses take them off to have a close look. Use as 
little force as possible, the travel of the locking mechanism is very short
and moves suddenly when lose.

Otherwise the PBNV3 is a very tidy solution to getting video out of your
Amiga and comes with the bonus of 1Mb chip ram, extra clockports and a RTC
socket.

@{b}Standard Adapter@{ub}

This seems to be the most common and earliest variant of the RGB2HDMI, 
rectangle in shape the Pi sits a top the card at a horizontal angle to
the Denise. There are other versions where it has been turned vertically
but I have not been able to obtain that version yet. Compared to the 
PiggyBackNotV3, this is much simpler to install but it also puts a bit
more pressure onto the Denise. I also found the connection to be quite
squishy, any small amount of pressure and the board would pop off. I had
tried to use the male mini HDMI to female HDMI adapter that was sent by
Amigastore.ey and the part that plugs into the Pi was pushing on my low 
profile CF adapter, this caused the adapter to pop off any time I moved 
the Amiga or plugged in the HDMI cable. Not an ideal situation at all.

There is a solution to this though, if you have already removed your RF
modulator you can install a female HDMI port that will connected with a
flex cable. Due to the angle of the standard HDMI2RGB board you need to
find a male mini HDMI cable that is straight, and not the angled one. 
However I believe the angled type will work on the PBNV3 though. Once
again you need to be careful with the Denise connector, like the PBNV3
the connector will wear out after one or two times of attaching to the
Dense chip, it is really a one way trip whe putting on the board so 
make sure you have planned all your cabling in advance.

@{b}Picture Quality@{ub}

Compared to my Indivision ECS the RGB2HDMI does an incredible job, the
picture looks as if it is coming from an emulator. I have not seen a
real Amiga 600 output such a bright and crisp image before. To give you an
idea, when I used the Indivision, I could still see artifacts and waving
on the picture. With the RGB2HDMI the picture solid and smooth. 

It seems the card does not support the more exotic resolutions though
which the Indvision cards do but if you are happy to just run in the default 
PAl HiRes or HiRes Laced then this card cannot be beat in quality and price. 

Changing settings is a breeze with the button, one short press to move 
through the menus and one long press to select. There are many settings, 
from turning on and off scanlines, setting it for a different system, herz 
settings etc. There seems to be a lot to what is possible with the RGB2HDMI.

Installation of the firmware is a simple download from the RGB2HDMI website
and then use the RaspberryPiSDCardInstaller to set up the card.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

The RGB2HDMI is one of the best upgrades you can get for your A600, it makes
using the system so much nicer. I would like to have seen a more sturdy 
build regarding the Denise adapters, this is something the manufacters could
learn from the Indivision cards. Aside from this issue the cards are very 
nicely made and it is great there are a variety of types available for those 
who have fastram/accelerator and those who want to keep their Amigas stock 
but still use a modern display.

@{i}A Bit of a Reputation@{ui}

It was a with a bit of trepidation that I put the Furia into the shopping
cart and paid. If you are on any of the Amiga boards you will have seen
the numerous threads asking for help with the Furia. It seems to be a 
magical beast who grants it{s power to only those few it deems are worthy
of it. On paper the card looks very nice:

* 680EC020 at 33Mhz
* MC68882 FPU at 40Mhz
* 9.5Mb of RAM
* PCMCIA friendly
* Maprom ability

A very robust set of features that will make your Amiga 600 sing and fly
while doing tasks. The version that I received was the lastest revision
with a black board instead of the red and white versions. As a precaution
I also bought a *compatible* CF and SD card from Amigastore.eu, they came
preinstalled with Workbench.

@{b}The Board Itself@{ub}

The board is pretty large and covers a large portion of the motherboard, if
you have an RGB2HDMI then you will need the versions that have the flex 
cable or the PiggyBackNotV3. There is a massive heatsink that covers most 
of the board with a jumper near the bottom to control the speed of the IDE
interface. It clicks on with a very nice click, and if you want to (but I
do not recommend doing so) you can lift the Amiga with Furia attached.
This is something that the RGB2HDMI manufacturers could learn, the adapters
need to clip on properly otherwise it is just a waste of Amiga users money.

Once the board was snuggly and the *compatible* CF installed, it was time 
to turn on the Amiga and see if the trouble past was behind the Furia. On
first power the Amiga just sat with a black screen, remembering from forums
that the board needed to have some considerable pressure added when 
installing, I turned everything off and applied some more pressure to the
card. Once again I turned on the Amiga and low and behold it booted to 
Workbench, and wow what a fast boot at that. I opened some windows to see
how it felt and the Amiga 600 just flew, opening drawers and rendering 
windows like never before. Just from the Workbench experience this little
card chugging along.

However I was still a bit wary and decided to try some more intensive hard
disk work copying some files over and this is where the Furia fell over.
As soon as I started to copy some files from one partition to another the
Amiga froze, only a three finger salute allowed me to get the Amiga back
again. Hmm so it seems there is still an issue with CF flash cards, no 
worries I have a fast SanDisk SD card, so in went the CF card adapter and
SD card. Again the Amiga did not boot on a cold start, when it did reboot
it got about half way into the boot sequence and then just hung. This was
not looking promising.

After a few hours of work I could get the Amiga to only boot with the CF
card from Amigastore.eu, but even then doing any hard disk work would lock
up the Amiga. After a few days of trying various other tricks such as 
changing the file system to a new one and other types of installs of 
Workbench the Amiga and Furia were not stable together. I decided to send
the card back to Amigastore.eu, they had a look and found the card to not
be working correctly at their end as well. So from the looks of it this
was an unlucky card.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

When the card was in use my Amiga 600 was just speeding through everything
it was a great joy to use. It is amazing how much power the card provides
to the lowly A600. Though it is a pain to set up and I would hesitate
recommending this card to someone who is not experienced with the Amiga
or is willing to put in the hours and maybe days to get it working. If you
are able to get it working then you will have one hell of a fast Amiga but
there is no guarantee that it will work at all in your system.

A card with much potential hamstrung by a fiddly setup and random 
compatibilty with CF and SD cards. If you can master the Furia then it is
a great card, but that is if you CAN master it.

@{b}Review@{ub}

Since OS3.2 cameout there has been a slow trickle of OS3.2 targetted 
programs. Even though it is less than I would like to see what has been
comeout are stellar releases. One such programme is DrawerGenie. It is 
freely available from Aminet and is well worth a look, let's delve into its 
features.

In a nutshell DrawerGenie takes much of the functionally usually accessed
from the menu and puts them within easy reach via a button bar displayed
in the window. However it is not limited to the standard functions available
from the menu, there is much more power in this little tool. The toolbar is
brought up by pressing F1, according to the author he has not had the time
to implement the tool bar showing automatically, however pressing F1 to 
bring up the toolbar is a fast and efficient way. It keeps the tool out of
the way when not needed. So what is offered when you press F1, a list of
actions is listed below:

	* Back
	* Parent
	* Cut
	* Copy
	* Paste
	* Refresh
	* New Drawer
	* Icon Information
	* Delete
	* View Type
	* Sort
	* File Visibility
	* Rename
	* Source
	* Destination
	* Copy To
	* Move To
	* View Files    
	* Select All
	* New Shell
	* Unpack Archive
	* View Archive
	* Pack Archive
	* Find Files	
                    
As you can see the available actions is very extensive and as such you will
need to be running Workbench in a relatively high resolution, at least a 
Laced mod. HiRes PAL makes for a bit of a tight squeeze, I found that with
HIGHGFX: Super-HighRes the bar fit very nicely into the windows. 

@{b}In Use@{ub}

As stated before to get access to the button bar you need to press F1, this
also applies when you open a new window, the bar will not be carried across
to a new window. The functions I found to be very useful and quickly 
DrawerGenie became part of my usual Workbench flow, I find that when I do
not have it installed I am looking for it. Just the simple task of press
a button to refresh the window to find contents is a much faster experience
that having to go to the drop down menu. My system runs at 50Mhz with the
060, I have a Rev 5 so I unable to run the system any faster. But 
DrawerGenie really flies on my system, it also works well with CaBoom the
utility for animating the opening and closing of windows which sometimes
causes conflicts with other commodities.

Many of the tasks that I would usually go to DOPUS for are not taken care
of quickly with DrawerGenie such as unpacking/packing a file or viewing an
archive's contents.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

This review has only touched the surface of what DrawerGenie is capable of
but in the short time that I have used it, DrawerGenie has become an 
essential tool that has earned a permanent place in my WBStartUp drawer. If
you have an OS3.1.4  or higher system then you owe it to yourself to give
this tool a try. If you want to learn more about DrawerGenie then please
read the @{"interview" link robcranley} we have with the developer in this issue.

Welcome to Aminet Goodies section, each issue one of our writes will list
their top 10 downloads from Aminet. For this issue there were no writers 
with the time to write up a list. So this time round I will list some of the 
fun utilities you can download for Workbench that have been recently 
uploaded to Aminet.

@{b}AmiWeatherForecasts@{ub}

With more classic Amigas online than ever, it is nice to be able to take
have some modern features. AmiWeatherForecasts places the weather 
information in the Workbench menu bar. It shows the place, temperature
and an icon for cloudy, rainy, or sunny weather. You can set your location
by clicking on the menu bar and then using the drop down menu to access
settings.

@{b}DarkForces Amiga Port@{ub}
 
=> http://aminet.net/game/shoot/tfe_darkforces.lha

Originally only released for the PC and Mac, we finally get a port for
our powered up Amigas. You need to buy the DOS port from gog.com or
steampower.com, the Mac version is not supported. It can be run on an
040 or 060, supports AGA and RTG. I find the best way to play the game
is in NTSC LowRes, which can be done via icon info, look for (FORCE PAL)
and change it to NTSC. I found with the Indivision AGA MK3 it provided
a full screen image. A great first person shooter that shows again that
the Amiga was more than capable if it had a more powerful CPU.

The latest update came out in October, updating to latest version will
make for a much more pleasant browsing experience, this includes using
the latest version of YAM. Since version 5 AmiSSL has been compatible
with OpenSSL 3.1. Essential update if you access the internet from your 
Amiga.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{b}MMULibs@{ub} (updated 26th Nov 2023)
 
=> http://aminet.net/util/libs/MMULib.lha 

Essential library if you are running an 040 or 060, especially if it is
an TF1260. If you already have MMULib installed then you do not need to
worry about this version as there have been no major changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{b}IconLib@{ub} (updated 26th Nov 2023)
 
=> http://aminet.net/util/libs/IconLib_46.4.lha 

The latest update fixes an error in WB3.0/3.1 that caused an "Object
Not Found" error when creating a new drawer in WB. New options have
also been added for WB3.0/3.1 - "DropNewIcons", "KeepNewIcons" and
"KeepColorIcons". A great utility that provides a welcome speed boost
to Workbench icons.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{b}RNOSlides@{ub}
 
=> http://aminet.net/gfx/misc/RNOSlides_68k.lha

Another great utility from the house of RNO, this time around we are treated
to a slide utility that has the ability to save slideshows in two video
formats (MJPEG and AVI), and add text over images. It should be possible to 
view the slideshow within the program but I was unable to do that. However
it is still a very useful utility, especially that I can save out my 
graphics work as an AVI for presenting away from my Amiga.

============================================================================

A rather short list for this issue but I hope you will find some utilties
that you have never used before or feel like revisiting. See you next issue
when we should have another writer giving their suggestions.

@{b}Weasels Gaming Corner: Something old and something new@{ub} - by @{"Ivan Sorensen" link ivansorensen}
============================================================================

The Weasels Gaming Corner

This issue I again wanted to take a look at two titles, one new (to the 
Amiga) and one from back in the day.

First up we have Metal Law: A side scrolling @{b}run and gun@{ub} with more 
than a little bit of Judge Dredd vibes about it. The game has pretty catchy 
music and surprisingly large sprites. It also features some interesting 
movement capabilities and pretty good visuals. 

The gameplay is fairly straight forward: Move around the level, collect a 
few items and blow away anything that moves. Along the way you have access 
to a rocket assisted double jump feature, something not commonly seen in 
Amiga platformers. 

There is a particular vibe I always associate with the Amiga: Games that 
are perhaps a bit more ambitious than what the developers could pull off 
and Metal Law feels like it fits in that category. It never quite reaches 
what I think the developers hoped it would, but it makes for a fun evening 
of blasting mutant scum in the sewers.

Metal Law is not especially long or difficult so it is a game you stand a 
fair chance of being able to complete with a bit of work.

A WHDLoad version is available requiring 1 MB of RAM. The game does not 
require AGA. 

On a more modern note we have an Amiga port of Magica. Originally an 
Amstrad game, this can be downloaded from Andy Noble's website at:

=> http://andynoble.co.uk/ 

A WHDLoad install is also available adding a number of trainer options. 

Magica is a platformer where you have to zap various fantasy creatures, 
then run to touch them before they wake up again. If you do, they are flung 
across the platform (stunning any creatures they hit) and turn into a potion. 
Your goal is to turn every creature on the screen into a potion, collect 
them all and then reach the exit when it appears, usually against a 50 
second time limit.
 
The game is very reminiscent of other single screen games like Bubble Bobble 
but manages to have its own identity. The music is fantastic and the 
graphics and animation is quite pleasing while being simple.
 
The game saves your progress so you can knock out a few levels and come back 
to it later. 

Well recommended. 

Lastly I wanted to talk about a peculiar phenomena: Being captivated by a 
bad game. The game in question is Death Mask: An attempt to cash in on the 
rise of Doom clones with a @{b}step by step 90 degree turns@{ub} gameplay 
approach (similar to Hired Guns but without any of the complexity of that 
game). 

Death Mask is pretty weak in all regards: The sound is pretty limited, the 
graphics engine has some weird effects where you can often see through doors 
when turning, the controls manage to both be stiff AND over responsive at 
the same time and combat is completely banal (You can only shoot straight 
ahead). Enemy AI is non existent and most have only a couple frames of 
animation (and a few do not appear to be animated at all). There are a few 
saving graces like a map that indicates objectives and enemies on it, as 
well as the ability to play two player split screen. We played this back in 
the day since it could be played two player on even an A500 and I 
occasionally replay it just to relive a few memories. It is by all accounts 
a pretty bad game and yet I've gotten the burning urge to actually play it 
to completion. 

Does this ever happen to you? 

When you sit down this weekend to do some Amiga gaming consider revisiting 
one of the games that you secretly knows was pretty bad and try to give it 
an honest shot at progressing. You may be surprised or maybe you won't. 

Weasel Out.

@{b}Review@{ub}

It is very rare for my wife to come running into the study when I am
playing a game, however, she heard me muttering various colour names,
"red and grey, red and grey', over and over. She was under the impression
that I was having some kind of mental breakdown. Instead, she found me
sitting in front of my Amiga, controller in hand, deep in concentration
moving a small sphere around a screen of coloured tiles. With the hour
past my wife was sitting in the same position, glued to the screen repeating
colour names over and over. And so this is how we were both introduced to
the game Spheroid.

Spheroid at its core is a simple move of the sphere around using the
various tiles. There are several coloured tiles and others that allow you
to transport from one area to another, ones that collapse after you roll
over them, others are iced sending your sphere careening off the screen
into the black abyss. Where things get more complicated are the "safe"
colours, it may be two or more, depending on the screen. If you roll
over another colour you explode in an exuberant way with the explosion
effect sounding very much like from the A-Team.

That is all there is really to it, roll your ball around the screen and
figure out the path to the exit. However, while it sounds simple, the game
gets fiendishly difficult quickly as the screens get more complicated with
routes that seem simple at first glance but are much more complex than at
first glance. Add in the time limit that only starts counting down when
you stop moving and you will find yourself repeating colours and
sweating while moving your little sphere around the screen.
The graphics are nicely drawn, with the title screen giving you all the
information you need, so study it first before entering the game. It has a
very early 90s feel, while the graphics are simple during gameplay they
are pleasant to look at and provide you with the visual cues you need to
complete the level.

For audio, we are treated to a stomping acid house track, something that I
would not normally be associated with a puzzle game but it works very well,
getting your heart pumping and adding to the sense of pressure and time.

@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

Spheroid is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time.
The gameplay is simple and straightforward but with puzzles that can get 
quite challenging, well for me at least. It has that essential element of 
seeming easier than it is and hooking you in with one more try. It is much 
fun to play as my wife can attest to, it is a game that will have you 
thinking about the puzzles hours after you have finished playing it. On top 
of that, the game looks very polished with simple but effective graphics 
and a pumping soundtrack.

On a side note, I teach students with learning difficulties such as dyslexia 
and ADHD. During my time reviewing Spheroid, I tested it on a few of my 
students and noted some interesting things.
 
a) Even though it was a retro looking game they quickly got into it and
   enjoyed it greatly.
b) The most surprising was how it helped  with their concentration. After 
   playing they were able to concentrate better in the lesson and do
   more work. 

It is known gaming can help but I have never seen it before as with 
Spheroid.

@{b}Pros and Cons:@{ub}
+ Simple but nice to look at graphics
+ Music is pumping and suits the game well
+ Gameplay is simple but hides a very deep game
  I cannot think of anything negative, other than maybe some variety in the 
  music

@{b}Scores@{ub}
Gameplay: 10/10
Graphics: 8/10
Sound:    8/10

A very addictive and smart game that will have you hooked for hours if not 
days.

@{b}Review@{ub}

By now you probably have already heard of or seen details on these two games
having won game of the year in 2022 for Planeta Sinclair Awards, Tenebra has
been ported to pretty much every platform out there. For those who do not 
know about the game, it is a simple puzzle game with the aim being to find
the exit. This is achieved by moving lights, finding keys, lighting cold
braziers, increasing the range of your light with oil, squeezing through
cracks, fixing broken rails with a hammer, activating light sensitive 
sensors and passing through archways that collapse after you. Tenebra 1
contains 31 levels and Tenebra 2 has 35. The Amiga version can also be
run in HiRes Laced though you will need a flicker fixer to not get a 
headache.

The graphics are wonderfully simple, using only two colours but managed to 
be very effective. The light effect is achived by simple white dots but it
works very well. When you finished a level it is revealed completely and I
am always surprised by how simple the level is. It is a very interesting
example of how our brain copes with a lack of information. When I am moving
around the gameplay area I feel as if the room is much bigger and 
complicated. In a way it is almost like reading a book since you have to
create much of the scenario in your head, something that is perhaps missing
in modern games. There is also the option to have the screen flicker to
mimic the effect of a torch, it nice that the feature can be turned off.

Audio wise there is not much except for a haunting wind in the background 
and the sound effects for doors, switcheds and keys. Again minimalistic
but highly effective with the option to be turned off.

Gameplay is very simple but gradually becomes more complicated, it is 
important to not rush head on into the game and read the hints at the
beginning of each stage. The puzzles are not particulary hard but they
did cause to think for a while. Control is done by the joystick, sadly
there is no keyboard control which I think would suit this type of game
more than using a joystick/control pad. Fingers crossed this will be
added in the future. It is also nice to have the level codes so that 
you can go back to the game at a later date.

I greatly enjoyed playing both games, however if you have not played the
first one then it is not advisable to go straight to Tenebra 2 as the first
one teaches you much of the basics and will help when playing the second
game.
 
@{b}Final Thoughts@{ub}

Tenebra 1 and 2 are wonderfully addictive and fun to play, they are easy to 
pick up and not too difficult. While some might balk at the simple graphics
they work more the game's advantage. I also played the Mac version but 
found the game lost some of its charm with the high resolution graphics and
light effects. Tenebra takes me back to playing games on our ZX81 and D&D
or HeroQuest with my mates. Download the game this winter and play it with
a family member if possible as it works great as a team game. While the
game is free I recommend paying the developer whatever you can as way of 
thanks for their efforts.
 
@{b}Pros and Cons:@{ub}
+ Simple graphics
+ Background sound effect suits the game well
+ Gameplay is easy to pick up and not too hard
- No keyboard control, a game like this would really benefit from keyboard
  control

Fantastic game with lots of atmosphere, don't be put off by the graphics
as they help to create a better game.

@{b}A314-CP Fix: A314.device not found@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

The A314-CP has grown to become one of my favourite add ons for the Amiga 
due to its ease of use and expansion possibilities. However there has been 
one issue that has been bugging me for a while. It arises from the Pi side 
of things due to the OS taking around 15 seconds to boot and then connect 
to the Internet. Since my Al200 has a TF1260 there is not extra clock port 
to have a battery RTC installed. So I need to grab the time and date from 
the Internet. This is done easily with the 'pisetclock' command in the 
start up sequence or using 'ntp' program to grab the time from an online 
server.

The issues arise due to the boot time of my Workbench being faster than the 
Pi OS, this then results in an error in loading the A314.device and the 
time not being set properly. After a quick think about the issue it was 
obvious that I needed to time the network connection and setclock command to 
when the Pi was ready and connected to the network. The solution came about 
with some help from Ivan from the Tokyo Retro Computer users meet.

What we need to do is put a delay into the Workbench, and where you put this 
delay is important. I am using Roadshow for my TCP/IP stack as such this 
command needs to be put before loading Roadshow. In my case Roadshow is 
loaded from the 'user-startup' file, so I need to add a delay to the boot 
sequence just before it loads Roadshow, to give time for the PiOS to connect 
to the internet. A simple command of 'WAIT 30 SEC' is all that is needed. I 
tested it with a shorter time and for my setup, 30 seconds gave me the best 
results, it could vary depending on your setup. A part of my user-startup 
is shown below ..

WAIT 30 SEC
;BEGIN Roadshow
If EXISTS S:Network-Startup Execute S:Network-Startup Endlf
;END Roadshow

This will stop the error of A314.device not being loaded or unavailable.
Now that issue is sorted we can load the 'pisetclock' command, I found the 
most reliable place to put it was in the 'startup-sequence' right after the 
'LoadWB' command, as can be seen below ...


C:LoadWB C:PiSetClock EndCLI >NIL:

I tried placing it earlier before 'LoadWB' but it was not so reliable when 
setting the clock. Having it just after 'LoadWB' sets the clock about 5 
seconds after Workbench has loaded, giving you the feel of having a RTC 
inside your Amiga. This is a very simple solution and though you do have to 
wait a bit longer for the Amiga to boot it gives you a stable clock and date 
solution. The other alternatives would be to buy a clock port expander and 
add a RTC card to the board along with the A314-CP. But if you are happy 
with the 30 second delay then this is a great option, you might be even able 
to shave a few seconds off the time depending on your setup.

@{b}Creative Graphics: 3D Objects and A Word Processor@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

Words create worlds, each time we pick up a book and start reading we are 
creating a fully fleshed world in our mind just from the words of the 
pages. But what about creating 3D objects that can be rendered in any 3D 
rendering software with your word processor?

Welcome to Creative Graphics, a new series that will look at creative ways 
of making graphics without adhering to any particular software. Instead of 
making you into a professional pixel artist, this series will explore how 
to use the Amiga and the variety of software in fun and creative ways. To 
use a well-known phrase, "Standing on the shoulders of giants", the first 
article in this series will take influence from an article in the US 
magazine Amazing Computing.

The first time I read the article the thing that caught my attention most 
was when it mentioned using a word processor to create a 3D object. My 
curiosity peaked, I read the article and followed the guides and greatly 
enjoyed it. So to begin this series we will borrow some ideas and go a bit 
beyond. To begin with we will need the following software:

	* Final Writer 5 (Or other word processors that can create tables)
	* ImageFX 2+
	* Pixel 3D Pro (This can be found on Amiga Format disk AF65A)
	* LightWave 3D (Or any other 3D rendering software)

To begin with let's open up FinalWriter, and using the menu bar go to
'Tables' and select 'Create'. Under the 'Settings' tab set columns to
10 and rows to 5, 'Column Width' should be 0.75 inches. Select the 'Lines'
tab and set everything that has a weight of 1 point to 4 points. Select
'Use' and generate the table. You might need to drag the table so it is
centred on the page. Keeping FinalWriter open, find ImageFX and start it 
up. Click the 'Buffer' button and select 'Grab Screen', you should see one 
that says "Final Writer - R", choose it and you will see a screen capture 
of FinalWriter show up on the ImageFX screen. You will need to crop the 
image so only the table is showing and this is easily done in ImageFX by 
clicking on 'Size', then 'Crop'. A box with handles will appear over your 
image, you can then drag them to fit the table. If you need to move the 
restraining box then click inside and drag. Just click on 'Crop' and you 
will see your cropped image appear if you need to crop more off repeat the 
process.

Next, we will need to reduce the colour of the image from whatever it was 
down to 2 colours. The reason is that Pixel 3D Pro only works with 2 colour 
images. Once you have rendered the image down to 2 colours, you will need 
to reverse the black-and-white image. This can be done by clicking on 
'Color' when in Toolbox (Selected from the right side) and then 'Negative'. 
Render the image as 2 colours again and save the image as 'Rendered Image' 
not '24-Bit Buffer'. Now you can close FinalWriter and ImageFX.

@{b}Pixel 3D Pro@{ub}

In the original article, it had called for the use of Pixel 3D Pro version
2, however, it is very hard to find a working copy of the programme. So as 
an alternative, you can download the previous version that came free with 
Amiga Format on cover disk AF65A.
 
Load up Pixel 3D Pro and you are presented with a display that looks similar 
to VistaPro. Find and click on the 'Load' hillton, locate your image and 
click on 'Accept'. A 2D image of your table will appear, to make it 3D, all 
we need to do is choose 'Extrude' from the left side. A requester will pop 
up and the only detail you need to change is the 'Extrude Value' to 30, then 
click on 'OK'. Now you will be presented with a wireframe representation of 
your table which you can move freely around. However we are not quite 
finished yet, we need to save the object by clicking on 'Save' and 
selecting the 3D program you will use to render the object. In my case I 
chose 'LightWave 3D', once it is saved you can close down Pixel 3D Pro and 
get ready for LighWave 3D, Imagine, Aladdin or whatever is your weapon of 
choice.

@{b}Landscapes and Tables@{ub}

Now you have your 3D object that started as a table in FinalWriter, pretty 
neat, right? 

From here you can use the object any way you like, create a city landscape 
where you can fly through the windows of skyscrapers, create a massive 
bookshelf, or maybe add a flat object to act like glass against the table 
object. By loading in many of the table objects and applying surfaces to 
them you can create unique landscapes where the light filters through the 
spaces in the tables. Why did we do it this way? Aside from being a fun 
experiment, it is also a much faster way to create an object like a 3D 
table this way, rather than having to cut and paste various objects 
together in the LightWave 3D modeller.

@toc guides
=============================================================================
@{b}Brilliance 101 Part 11@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
=============================================================================

By now the due date for the Amiga Art Competition has passed and so I
thought it might be worth going over my entry and how I created it. As per
usual I used Brilliance as while I started and really like DPaint,
Brilliance is more refined art package that is aimed at the artiste
So on to my image, first off the inspiration for my picture came about when
I was travelling Tokyo on the train. From my staâ¬ion the train line goes
over Tokyo bay and I get a great view of the bay and far into the distance e
It was on one trip and the sky was bright blue with huge white clouds on the
horizon and the water splattered with the sun's reflections. It struck me
as being quite beautiful. So I did what any typical Amiga user would do,
pulled out my laptop, started up UAE for Mac and sketched an outline of the
view in Brilliance. From there I had to stop as drawing with the mouse pad
was more stress than I wanted.

The initial sketch had the bottom part of the image in blue for the bay
and then I sketched the cloud shapes roughly. On another buffer I had
created the building silhouettes so that I could paste them in once I
was on my real Amiga.

Well, here I am now at my A1 200 and time to import the image from my laptop
thanks to the A 314-CP card it was a simple case of e-mailing it to my A1200
and the loading it into Brilliance. The first part of the image I worked on
was the water. I chose a simple gradient going from a darker blue to a
light blue with dithering enabled to give it a rougher look. However the
water looked a bit sterile and I wanted to include the reflections on the
water. This was achieved by drawing a small wave line in white with a pen
tip of about 3 pixels. I then made a brush out of the wave and pasted it on
the water. I held down the 'Left Shift' key to keep the cursor on the same
horizontal line when getting near the horizon. Once I had pasted down
several waves, I then used to the Transparent' tool to paste the brush on
the water and over some of the other waves to create more depth and variety
to the waves. Finally to create the impression of water the Smear' tool
was used on all the waves to make it look like the wave is moving. I find
the Smear' tool very useful when I want to create a more natural looking
image, especially as I am not artistically skilled.

Next it was time to move onto the clouds, I had to think hard on this one
and recalled that the clouds were darker at the bottom and lighter at the
top. The ' Gradient' tool came in very handy again. Choosing a colour that
is almost white and a very slightly dark grey I had my gradient, however
I did not want to use a standard verticle gradient. The gradient would
need to follow the contours of the clouds and I found the best was was to
use 'Highlight' gradient with the first colour, i.e. grey starting at the
bottom. So when the red line appeared after clicking the 'Fill' tool I
dragged it to the bottom on the cloud and it filled out nicely around
the edges. Now I shoud mention here that there are several layers of
clouds so make sure to have each of your cloud layers filled in a
completely different colour, it can be pink, red, purple etc. so that you
do not have a leaky flood as what happened to Andy Warhol ;)

Going back to the spare buffer I could now paste in the buildings on the
horizonal using various levels of shading, One of the easiest buildings to
see from the train is Tokyo Sky Tree, it has a very distinctive shape which
translates nicely into silhouette form.

So now we are finished with the basic scene of Tokyo bay, however I wanted
to create an image of the view from inside the train. To help save memory I
created a new separate image for the internal view. This is where my
limited art skills really started to let me down. My plan to was to create
a window with the a 3D effect and place sillhouettes of the passengers in
front of me. We will look at how this effect was achieved in the next issue.

@{b}ImageFX 101 Basics - Part 2@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

I hope you enjoyed the first part of our journey into ImageFX, it is a very
powerful program that is bit hamstrung by a rather difficult GUI. In this
part of the series we will look at a feature only found in version 4.5 of
ImageFX, that is the layer feauture. Something that has been the prevail of
Photoshop it has finally come to ImageFX, though it is not the only program
to have layers on the Amiga, Photogenics also has that feauture.
As with almost everything in ImageFX you need to start with the buffers,
for this guide you will need to load the standard version of ImageFX as
the Classic version does not seem to support layers as well. For this
example we will be using the included images with the ImageFX install. To
start open the file (SmallGal.JPG), once the image loaded we want to load
another image, the best way to do this is too click on 'Buffer' locate
' Load New' and choose the (SmallGuy.JPG) Now you should have two images
loaded in separate windows. Go back to the main window and look for the RGB
buttons, on the left of them you will find the Layers button. First make
sure which image you want as your main image, this is done by click on the
image itsefl. Then click on the Layers button and locate the gadget at the
top right and press it. A menu will pop up, choose 'New Layer From Buffer
and choose (SmallGuy.JPG). You will see the picture of (SmallGuy.JPG) cover
up the original image, you can hide it from view by clicking on the eye
icon in the Layer Manager.

From here you can have a play with the 'Mode' which has some interesting
effects. Choose 'Maximum' and 'Minimum' for some startling and rather
scary effects. Double clicking on the layer will bring up more options
for that particular layer. The layers can be moved by using the
Layer Manager, select your layer and use the pop up menu to move the
layer upper or lower. This should get you started with the basics of using
layers, next issue we will look at Photogenics and see how it compares to
ImageFX.

On another note, the first ImageFX tutorial has had some great feedback from
readers, some have even written in with suggestions. Once came from Boris,
who has another way to create a brush in ImageFX. I will hand it over to
Boris from here:

@{i}I don't know if it is easier, but it is more exact without loosing parts of
your image.

When the image is rotated, the background around the image has one color
In my case it is black. You choose now not the Poi y-tool for cutting, but
the Flood-option. Then you pick with this the black area. After this you
look in the Buffer-window for the Region-button. In the next window you
choose "Invert Region", then Okay. Now you choose the button "Pickup Region"
in the Brush-window ... et voila: you have the single rotated picture as
brush. I LOVE ImageFX!@{ui}

Thank you Boris for your suggestion, if anyone else has some ideas,
corrections or wishes to write their own guide then contact us on the forum
or via e-mail at: submissions@whatiff. info

@{b}How to make your external DF1 work just like DF0@{ub} - by: @{"John Scolieri" link johnscolieri}
============================================================================
How to make your external DF1 work just like DF0 with the PiStorm32 
accelerator.

So maybe you're like me at the moment and don't have an internal floppy 
drive handy to use in your Amiga 1200 with a PiStorm32 accelerator and Emu68 
but you do have an external floppy drive. And if you're like me then 
sometimes you want to boot up 'real' disks straight from boot up without 
entering Workbench and that won't work 'most' times unless your booting 
from DFO.

Luckily for us it's very simple to switch DF1 to DF0 when running Emu68 
which is as follows:

1- Take the microSD card out of your PiStorm32 and connect it to your PC.

2- In the main FAT32 partition there is a file called 'cmdline.txt'. If it 
   doesn't exist just create a new .txt file and name it cmdline.txt.

3- Open cmdline.text and add 'swap_df0_with_df1' (no quotes and it must be 
   on one single line)

4- Save the file and reinsert microSD card into your PiStorm32.

After you boot up again to Workbench you'll see you're external drive now 
as DF0 !

@{b}The Amiga Philosopher's stance on Amiga Games@{ub} - by: @{"Ivan Sorensen" link ivansorensen}
============================================================================

I find that while there is a lot of talk about Amiga gaming on the internet, 
whether on Youtube or the various forums and social media sites, there are 
certain types of posts that always seem to come up:

The game is bad because it had too much disk swapping / could not be 
installed on a hard drive / the Super Nintendo version was better / it was 
ported from the Atari / it was not arcade perfect and so forth.

Often the comments seem to be made by people who admit they do not play 
Amiga games any longer or have not touched the particular game since 1989.

These opinions often tend to cement themselves as people repeat opinions 
they have read, when they are not themselves familiar with the game in 
question. So soon @{b}everybody knows xxx is bad because yyy@{ub} which both 
gives a distorted perception of how games were received at the time but also 
keeps people away from games that they might in fact end up enjoying quite 
a bit if they tried them. 

So I would like to present an alternate view of games on the Amiga that is 
rooted in a different approach. The following points are not in order of 
importance and their individual applicability may vary depending on the game 
in question. Take it as a starting point or a set of guidelines and make up 
your own mind.

@{b}Point 1:@{ub}
To me it never matters if the Amiga version is the optimal port of the game 
or what other platforms it appeared on.

If I am sitting down to play an Amiga game, I am interested in the game on 
the Amiga, not a hypothetical better version on a different system.

This is particularly important if you are trying to better understand the 
historical side of the Amiga gaming scene. Games like Street Fighter 2 were 
greeted pretty enthusiastically in magazines at the time, even though they 
are considered to be bad ports today.

This also goes for games that were @{b}ST ports@{ub}: Nobody I knew had an 
ST so it did not make any difference to us at the time and it still does 
not. If the choice is between a fun game in 16 colours and a boring game in 
32 colours, surely we all agree that the fun game is the better outcome? 

@{b}Point 2:@{ub}
My opinion of a game is based on the machine I can play it on. 

That may sound selfish but let me explain: Amiga owners I think often suffer 
a peculiar psychological effect where we spend hundreds (or thousands) of 
dollars tricking out machines but every game must run flawlessly on an 
unexpanded Amiga 500. I don't understand it.
 
My system has a pretty fast 68030 which I wager is in the middle of the 
Amiga scene these days: You get people with unexpanded or barely expanded 
systems and you get people with monster fast systems but the median system 
is probably not that far from what I am using. 

So my stance on a game is based on how it performs on that system. It 
doesn't really matter if Fears for example runs poorly on a stock A1200 
because who is going to try to play it on that system in 2023?

This goes especially so for hard drives. People will complain about Beneath 
a Steel Sky coming on a huge stack of floppies but the game is hard drive 
installable. Is any serious Amiga fan really going to play the game running 
off floppies? 

This has given rise to a strange attitude among Amiga fans where people 
forget that while many games were not HD installable, plenty of them were 
(and most of the games that came on tons of disks like RPGs and adventure 
games supported hard drives).

There was nothing stopping you from installing Civilization or UFO to a 
hard drive in 1992 but people will still complain about disk swapping in 
UFO in 2023. 

Back in the day some magazines begin noting if a game ran better or had 
more features on an A1200 or on an expanded machine and I think that is 
something that modern reviewers should take into account. There is no reason 
to be perpetually mired in 1985 (even if we are nostalgic retro-nerds).

@{b}Point 3:@{ub}
My opinion is based on the version that exists today.

This ties into point 2 to an extent but unless you are strictly looking at 
the game in its historical context, there is no reason to not use the most 
updated version which usually means WHDLoad. Whether its preloading, adding 
trainers or expanding the control options, a lot of games are greatly 
improved by using this version.

Frustrated that you can't use a button to jump? Many games now do support 
that! 

Is there any reason to play the worse version? Again, if you are after the 
strict historical experience sure, I get it but otherwise get the better 
one. 

This is not even that ahistorical. I had games where I would use the cracked 
version over the disks I had purchased, because the cracked version added a 
trainer or level jump option or something similar.
 
Likewise some games did receive updated files or patches. That was harder to 
come by in those days but with Aminet it started to become a thing and PD 
games often had multiple versions released with improvements and bug fixes.

@{b}In conclusion:@{ub}
When I get back to reviewing games online, the games will be based on the 
most updated WHDLoad version running on my modestly expanded 1200 and based 
strictly on the Amiga version of the game.

@{b}Things Commodore Did Right@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

What comes to mind when you think about US Commodore Amiga advertising?
Maybe the fetus on a stick, an Amiga 1 000 on a pedestal, an old man? When
it comes to the best advertising of the Amiga, the UK can arguably be
seen as a leader, yes it was video game focused but it did put the Amiga
in a good light. Well let me take you back to 1 988/89 when Commodore US
surprised many in the United States with a series of ground breaking and
fun TV advertisements. In these ads you had an American politician, Apollo
astronauts, famous musicians of the time and sports celebrities all
together.

I was fortunate enough to be living in the States when I got my first
Amiga. We had just moved to Pennsylvania and needed a computer to replace
our aging ZX Spectrum. After seeing the A500 in the stores we were quickly
convinced this was the computer for us. It was also during this time that
I would witness some of the best Commodore US advertising ever.
The first thing that comes to mind when I recall seeing the advertisements
was the music. They used The Goonies soundtrack and it greatly helped to
create a sense of excitement and wonder. For a generation that grew up
with Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Goonies, Ghostbusters, E.T., The A-Team
and Airwolf these new advertisements spoke our language in tone and theme.

The standard setup of the advertisements were a normal looking middle class
American home, a teenage boy named Steve and his Amiga. Each advertisement
focused on one aspect of the Amiga's multimedia abilities. Video production
, music, and animation. In a stroke of genius they managed to convince stars
of the day to appear all together. Just to illustrate the celebrity royalty
that showed up, here is a list of all of them for just one of the ads.

	* Musicians: The Pointer Sisters, Burt Bacharach, Little Richard
	* NASA astronauts: Buzz Aldrin, Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper
	* US politician: Tip O 'Neill
	* Baseball player and coach: Tommy Lasorda

In just one ad they all appear asking for Stevie's help with their music,
building the ISS, calculations and more. Just think for a second of an ad
that would have that many celebrities showing their support for a Mac or
Windows PC today? It just does not seem possible.

A later episode had him tricking his nextdoor neighbour by hijacking their
TV and showing him accepting an award with the Amiga hooked up to a Genlock
and providing titles and effects.

This was really ground breaking because never before had a computer
advertisement show what computers and more importantly the Amiga was truly
capable of. It made using the Amiga look fun but also illustrated very well
how truly capable the the Amiga was. It is only recently we have had
advertisements showing what you can do with a smartphone but not with a
computer and certainly not in 1988.

If you think back to the ads that were shown in the UK the Amiga was mostly
marketed as a games machine but these ads from the US really showed how
versatile the Amiga was. It makes me wonder if they had been shown in the UK
how would it have impacted the general view of the Amiga. I hope this has
given you a better idea of how revolutionary the ads were and if you have
not seen them yet then pop on over to YouTube, I have included the links
below. It makes you wonder what could have been and more importantly enjoy
the excitement that the Amiga still generated back then.

@{b}Amiga Through the Lens of an LD Learner@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

LD, learning difficulty, commonly associated with dyslexia or ADHD, it
should not be confused with learning disability. In this article we are
going to concentrate on learning difficulty and how the Amiga can be used
as an aid in learning and concentration in ways that that modern hardware
and software cannot do offer.

From the start I think I should make clear that I am qualified dyslexia
specialist with over 10 years teaching experience of children with dyslexia
and ADHD. Over this time I have had the opportunity to experiment with
various teaching techniques, some failing and some working. One factor that
has been a common denominator is children love technology and they love old
technology as well I want to talk a bit about the teaching experience first 
to give some basis of how the Amiga can be helpful. 

For the majority of tutoring learners with dyslexia or ADHD, from now on we 
will use LD, patience and variety is a very important tool. When I say 
variety I mean using kinaesthetic methods, having the learner move their 
body, trace letters in the air, using sand to give a tactile feedback, 
speaking and writing at the same time. This is just the tip of some of the 
techniques applied. 

In some instances however writing by hand can become quite stressful and 
in these instances schools and tutors allow the student to use a computer to 
write on. Now it needs to be stated that using a smartphone or tablet is 
not advised, even one with an attached keyboard as the tactile feel from 
typing is an essential factor when writing with a computer. With the newer 
computers however there has been the fashion of making thinner keyboards 
with less travel and while this is making the keyboard/laptop thinner it 
is taking away a very useful tool in learning. When you have to push the 
keys harder, feel the shape of the key and hear the clickty clack of typing 
it all adds to helping create a stronger impression. You can probably try 
it yourself, try and touch type on a new thinner keyboard verses the ones 
with more travel, I think you will find your typing to be more accurate.

So this is one aspect of where the Amiga really helps, it provides a tactile
typing experience, where the learner can touch the keys, hear the sounds
and have to push a bit more than compared to a touch screen or newer type
keyboard.

We have now looked at how the Amiga provides a more tactile typing
experience which aids in the learning experience. Next we will look at how
using an Amiga word processor is better than any of the modern equivalents.
Any learner with LD with struggle to a greater or lesser extend with
concentration, as such, LD tutors will always look for ways to reduce the
amount of distractions. The smartphone is a gateway drug to distraction with
its notifications, multitasking, in coming phone calls and messages. The
modern computer is no less distracting with internet access easily available
and notifications becoming standard on a desktop computere With the Amiga
we can throw all of this away. I had a great experience when my student
first tried Excellence! he stopped and asked where the buttons were, how
can I draw, where is the browser?

He was on an Amiga 600 with just 2MB of ram.

While he found it jarring at first he quickly got drawn into the simple
GUI design, the low resolution graphics and tactile keyboard. There was
far less looking around, fiddling with buttons or swiping at the screen
just looking down at the keyboard to find his key and then looking at the
screen. I allowed him to do some simple editing such as adding bold or
using extra characters but it was a very minimal experience. And one that
really helped him, he had to take his time to find the correct key and this
really aided in his learning the spelling. Often an overload of stimuli can
cause a freeze in learning, and this is exacerbated by modern tech. The 
Amiga provides a working environment that is visual quiter and less 
disracting than modern devices.

If you have a child with LD and they struggle with reading and writing, sit
them down in front of an Amiga and see what happens, it just might surpise
you!

@{b}Amiga in 2023@{ub} - by: @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

By the time you are reading this it is either near the end of 2023 or it is
already 2024. As this is our last issue of 2023 it seems appropriate to 
look back at what happened in 2023. So grab a hot mug of tea, coffee, hot
chocolate or something with a bit more of kick and read on. But before we
get on I will mention this does not represent the Amiga community as a whole
and was gathered from people who decided to vote from AmiBay, EAB, Amiga.org
and the WhatIFF? forum poll. Some Amiga users have scoffed at the idea of
this poll and it may not be perfect but it at least give a partial view
of how people viewed 2023 regarding new hardware and software.

@{b}On to the awards ...@{ub}

2023 we had a lot of new games come out, it was probably the best year we 
have had for games in a while but WhatIFF? is not about the games, really, 
as such an informal poll was done across several Amiga forums regarding the 
best hardware and software of 2023.

@{b}In the hardware category@{ub} the resounding result was the PiStorm, this
card has taken the Amiga scene by storm (pun intended :), bringing the 
power of emulation to real hardware. WhatIFF?'s hardware of the year
award goes to PiStorm. Other hardware should get a mention as well are the
Vampire series of cards and RGB2HDMI adapters.

@{b}Software@{ub} wise the Amiga had many games released however regarding serious
software the list was much more limited and concentrated more on updates.
The software that got the most votes was Amiga OS3.2.x, below that came in
Infinity Music Player (Imp3) and IBrowse.

Finally we will look at the @{b}best Amiga vendor@{ub} of 2023, writing for WhatIFF?
requires reviewing various hardware and software as such we are ordering
from various Amiga shops and over the year have created a list of the best
vendors servicing the Amiga. For 2023, there has been one stand out Amiga
shop that has shipped their products very quickly, responses in record
time to questions, has reasonable prices and is able to respond in a timely
and polite manner to issues. Taking all of these points into consideration
the award for WhatIFF?'s best Amiga vendor of 2023 goes to: 

=> www.amigastore.eu

They have consistently provided good service and most importantly been 
helpful when issues occurred with damaged/non-working hardware. while there
are other Amiga vendors out there doing a fantastic job AmigaStore.EU has
done just that little more by having competitive prices and providing A
class service. 

Thank you to everyone who voted and gave suggestions, finally thanks must 
be given to all the hardware and software developers keeping our Amiga scene
alive and exciting. And it would be remiss of me to not to mention the 
importance and hard work of all the Amiga vendors, who are also keeping the
Amiga alive for new comers and veteran users. A happy new year and here is
looking forward to 2024!

@{b}Interview - Andrew Vaisey: Spheroid@{ub} by @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

@{b}1. Hi Andy, thank you for taking the time for this interview, to begin with 
   can you tell us a little about yourself?@{ub}

My pleasure, thank you for taking an interest and asking!

I'm an almost 50 year old from Wales, UK, who has been using computers 
since he was about 10 years old, mainly various Commodore machines.  I'm a 
teacher by trade, but currently work in the family business as a manager.  
I'm happily married (Hi Chantelle, sorry you have to keep putting up with 
this Commodore @{b}thing!@{ub}), have two lovely daughters and three wonderful 
grandchildren.

I'm slowly introducing the grandchildren to the wonders of old computers and 
gaming.  My eldest grandson already has some Commodore64 testing and 
graphics credits to his name on the Commodore Scene Database (CSDb), has 
been testing Spheroid for me and recently finished his first PC game coding 
project.  The second grandson has been testing Spheroid for me and his best 
so far is level 7 and considering he has only just turned 4, that's quite an 
achievement!

@{b}2. How did you get started with the Amiga?@{ub}

After 4 years of using a Commodore64, I asked for and received an A500 (with 
the 10 Star Pack) for Christmas 1988, after being wowed by the graphics and 
sound being demonstrated on an A1000 in a local independent computer store.  
I never put my C64 away though.  My Amiga and C64 always sat next to each 
other on the desk in my bedroom when I was younger and *still* do, now I'm 
(much) older!

@{b}3. You have recently released the game Spheroid, have you created any other 
   games prior to Spheroid?@{ub}

On the Amiga, no.  I've developed and released a few games and demos on the 
C64 (which you can find on CSDb) and have a couple of unreleased games on 
the PC.  I've also contributed to other people's games and demos across 
various 8bit machines, mainly graphics and music.

@{b}4. How did the idea for Spheroid come about?@{ub}

Now that's a story!  Back in around 1988, in the days before I started 
coding seriously on any machine, I started to create a simple game where 
you guided a metal ball around a maze of coloured squares.  This was done on 
the C64 using SEUCK.

Once I had an Amiga, I bought AMOS in around 1990 (?) and set about 
recreating this maze game.  Being young, the idea was off and on for many 
years and went through numerous design changes and a swap to AMOS Pro so I 
could use the compiler.  That all finally stopped around 1993(ish), half-way 
through a major code refactoring: I had used AMOS procedures for all the 
subroutines without realising there was a limit to how many times procedures 
could be @{b}GOSUB@{ub} before a crash.

Fast forward to 2022 and after a few false starts, I finally get round to 
resurrecting my A1200 to see what remained of anything on the hard drive.  
Low and behold, it boots first time and after imaging the drive so I can 
snoop around in WinUAE, I find the Spheroid AMOS source and all the assets 
intact.  However, the code won't run as it was half-way through being 
refactored and after 30 years I didn't have a clue what I or it was doing!

However, I didn't want to waste the game design or assets so after a 
couple of days of learning Blitz Basic 2 (the game didn't need the raw speed 
of 68K), I set about recoding the game from scratch, with the main game 
engine coming together in a few days!

@{b}5. Was the game developed on real Amiga hardware or via emulation?@{ub}

Both. I don't like running my real hardware for too long these days, even 
with modern power supplies and recapped circuit boards, so most of the 
development was completed in WinUAE, with testing and tweaking on real 
hardware.  

I have my real Amiga setup "mirrored" WinUAE on my development laptop, 
except with an insane amount of RAM which speeds up development and reduces 
crashes!

I also have a RaspberryPi 3 with an Amiga system setup for additional dev 
work and testing.

@{b}6. You handled all the programming, graphics and sound, what software did 
   you use?@{ub}

For the actual game:

Ultimate Blitz Basic 2.1+ was used for code.  Graphics were drawn in Deluxe 
Paint IV and Personal Paint.  The music was written in OctaMED Pro 5.01b.  
Sound effects were grabbed with a Technosound Turbo sampler using 
AudioMaster, which also handled the sample editing as required.  A PC based 
level editor was created by Ray Lejuez, a fellow member of my scene group 
Arkanix Labs. 

Other software:
ReOrg, DOpus, IconDeluxe, VirusZ, BlacksEditor.

The loading and ending screens were created for me by Toni Galvez.  I 
believe he used ProMotion, if the comment data in the file is to be trusted!

@{b}7. What was the most challenging aspect of developing the game?@{ub}

Levels!  Game engines present certain challenges, but with perseverance, 
issues and bugs are overcome quickly.  Creating the levels is the slog and 
the challenge for me.  Keeping motivated is hard when you've done a few 
levels and realise there are 40 more to do!
                                    
@{b}8. Did you incorporate any ideas or influences from other games?@{ub}

Not really.  The main game design is completely my own.  Sure, there are 
probably "similar" games out there, but when I originally dreamt it up back 
in the late 1980s and developed it further in the early 1990s, there was no 
internet or online databases so I would have been blissfully unaware if 
there were analogous games.

If really pushed, I would probably say that the rolling ball was influenced 
by Quedex and the mine tiles by Bombuzal, both on the C64.  Some people have 
asked if the C64 puzzle game @{b}Sensitive@{ub} was an influence, but it wasn't.  
During the game design stage, I wasn{t aware of that game and the gameplay 
in Spheroid is different anyway.

@{b}9. Do you plan to release the game on other platforms?@{ub}

In time, Spheroid will be ported to the C64 (already at 20% progress) and 
the PC.  I'm handling the C64 version entirely myself.  On the PC, I'm 
handling code and music, with Toni Galvez supplying the graphics.

@{b}10. How do you start the development process?@{ub}

Jump straight in!  Whether on the Amiga or C64, once an idea gets into my 
head, I have to see it on the computer as soon as possible.  This usually 
results in a frantic couple of weeks where I focus completely on coding the 
main engine that drives the game.

That part of the process is actually the most satisfying for me, seeing what 
is possible, solving problems, finding bugs and so on.  Once the basics are 
working, I find it harder to keep up the pace with regards the content!

@{b}11. What advice do you have for other Amiga users who want to create their 
    own games?@{ub}

Coding wise, just go for it! Try starting with learning Blitz Basic 2!  When 
I first got Blitz back in the 1993, I found it quite unstable, with lots of 
crashes.  I've since realised that this was because of a lack of memory, 
even with the RAM upgrades I had at the time, and (very) numerous errors in 
the printed manual.

Running on WinUAE under KS/WB 3.1 with a 030/040 and 1Gb of RAM (impossible 
back in the day), Blitz is as stable as they come and really quite powerful!  
In addition, there are great resources online including corrected manuals 
and helpful forums and websites.

Sure, you're not going to write a Uridium 2 or Doom clone, but for most 
projects, Blitz is *more* than adequate!  It{s a great language!

@{b}12. Looking beyond Spheroid, do you have plans for other games?@{ub}

I know there are some people who are already looking for me to do a sequel 
to Spheroid on the Amiga, with improved graphics and additional gameplay 
elements.  This will probably happen once I have completed a couple of my 
C64 projects, probably happening in tandem with the PC port of Spheroid.

I'd also love to port some of my C64 games to the Amiga, including 
Chiller 2, CHILL3R, and the Lost Realms of Murkasada.

@{b}13. If you have any real Amiga hardware, what machines do you own?@{ub}

I have an A500 and two A1200s. The A500 is boxed up at my parents' house.  
One A1200 is boxed up safe under my bed and the other, set-up in my little 
development studio next to my Commodore64's.

My main A1200 has a 1230/16Mb card, a 4GB CF hard drive, an Indivision 
scandoubler/flicker fixer for HD video output and an internal Gotek floppy 
drive.  Externally connected is a Cumana floppy drive, a CD-ROM drive 
connected via a Squirrel interface and a Technosound Turbo Sound Sampler.  
There are various other bits and pieces as well, connected as required.

@{b}14. Which Amiga is your favourite and why?@{ub}

I{d have to say the A1200.

I loved my A500, but only really used it as a games machine.  Yes, I 
upgraded it with extra memory, a small hard drive and a few other bits and 
pieces, but games is all I really ever run on it.  When I started trying to 
get creative with code, graphics and music, the A500 started to run out of 
steam for me, even with the upgrades.

Once I'd got an A1200 with hard drive (and a few other bits and pieces) 
things really opened up.  The increased power and OS3.x reliability was 
great.  As well as being creative, I used it as my main machine right up 
until about 1999, completing my university degree work on it as well as 
creating classroom resources in the early days of my teaching career.  A 
VERY capable machine and still is, even to this day!

Although I've never owned them so can{t technically say they're my 
favourites, I'd love to have a big box Amiga, probably an A3000 or A4000.

@{b}15. Thank you for your time Andy and for creating Spheroid, is there 
    anything you would like to say to the Amiga community before we finish?@{ub}

Please continue supporting the Amiga scene!  By that, I mean make a purchase 
from or donation to (however small):

  * the many technical wizards who continue to design replacement parts or 
    offer repair services;
  * the numerous manufacturers and websites that still sell hardware 
    replacements and upgrades; 
  * the numerous individuals and groups still creating software, both games 
    and applications;
  * the many forums, blogs and magazines (print and online) who support users 
    and create new content. 

Without those above, there is no way I'd have been able to resurrect my 
A1200, maintain and upgrade it or begin creating on it again!  The Amiga 
really is a special computer!

============================================================================
@{b}Interview - Rob Cranley: DrawerGenie@{ub} by @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

@{b}1. Can you give us a brief background of your experience with the Amiga 
   programming?@{ub}

I was quite late to the Amiga, getting my first (an A1200) around 1993. 
Before that, I was using my trusty Atari 800XL, which I got when I was 8 or 
9 years old in the late '80s. I learned to program BASIC on that and the 
BBC Micro at school from the excellent Usborne computing books in the 
library, incidentally, the Usborne books are all available free now: 

=> https://usborne.com/gb/books/computer-and-coding-books 

I was also very interested in electronics, however one project I worked on 
was to add hardware to my Atari that would let it control motors and relays 
from code. Unfortunately, this damaged one of the chips in the Atari and so 
I was without a computer for a while until I got my A1200. Once I had that 
I started programming a little in AMOS, but quickly moved onto Blitz Basic. 
I also started learning C and ARexx from excellent books released by Amiga 
Shopper magazine, as well as C and QBasic on the PCs we had in secondary 
school. For me, programming was at least as important as gaming as a pastime 
and reason for having a computer.

For some time I was also coding as a part of my day job developing medical 
equipment, and that involved writing firmware for lab equipment and was 
mostly in C, but sometimes also for Windows using VisualBasic, C#, even 
Delphi at one point. But for me, I got the most enjoyment from programming 
in Blitz Basic on the Amiga, so that's what I kept doing in my spare time.

@{b}2. Is DrawerGenie your first Amiga application?@{ub}

No, I've released a few other applications too, most of which can be found 
on AmiNet. InstallerGen and SMBMounter are probably two of the most popular, 
though both are niche in their own way. Because I code mainly for fun, I 
have dozens of half-finished programs from the past 20 or 30 years. In most 
cases it's just a proof-of-concept, or a basic framework, nothing that could 
be called a finished application. I've also written a couple of games, 
mainly simple types like board games, but I brought Nivrig's excellent Dodgy 
Rocks to the Amiga using Blitz Basic.

I've thoroughly enjoyed getting involved in the recent Amiga jams hosted by 
Zooperdan: first was the Blitz Basic Game Jam, for which I and some friends 
developed WeegieNights. It was probably overambitious and didn't get 
finished in time, but still ended up 5th place in the jam despite its 
unfinished state. We still plan to finish that whenever we have time. Then 
came the Amiga Tool Jam, which wasn't Blitz Basic-specific, and DrawerGenie 
is my main entry for this jam. I also entered a second program called 
"Closer", but it's only a little joke and is rightly in the "Most Useless" 
category :)

@{b}3. Can you explain what DrawerGenie is and what makes it unique?@{ub}

DrawerGenie is a commodity, and it allows the user to attach toolbars to 
normal Workbench windows. These toolbars include a variety of functions 
accessible through icon gadgets, most of which already exist in Workbench 
in some form, but gather them neatly together for quick access at a click 
of the mouse. The intention was to add a little bit of Directory Opus-like 
functionality to Workbench; I used DOpus 5 Magellan back in the day until 
OS3.5 was released, at which time Magellan became somewhat incompatible and 
I stopped using it. Workbench had gained some more functionality, and OS3.9 
added to that, meaning that with some customisation through ARexx scripts 
and commodities, I didn't really need DOpus any more. But there are some 
very nice functions that DOpus provided that Workbench lacks, and 
DrawerGenie adds some of these. In particular, it lets the user access files 
with cut/copy/paste actions, designate a source and destination window to 
do 1-click copy and move operations, simple packing and unpacking of Lha 
files, as well as most of the standard Workbench functions like delete, 
rename, sort and so on. It's obviously inspired by Directory Opus and 
similar filemanagers, in particular the Lister commodity for OS4 that 
provides DOpus-style listers integrated with Workbench, but as far as I know 
there isn't anything quite like it for 68k versions of Workbench.

@{b}4. How did the concept/idea for DrawerGenie come about?@{ub}

I was saying before that I was a Directory Opus 5 Magellan user before OS3.5 
came about, then switched to using OS 3.5 / 3.9 with some scripts to fill in 
the gaps in functionality. But I'm also an OS4 user, and on OS4 there's a 
great commodity called "Lister", which provides DOPus 5-style listers 
directly on Workbench. This is a great compromise between replacing 
Workbench completely and not having the DOpus-style functions, and I began 
to miss a similar thing on OS3. The idea of a small helper toolbar for 
Workbench basically came from that - what if we could just have the toolbar 
from Lister but the icon layout and full integration of a normal Workbench 
window? It's an idea that had been floating around in my head for a long 
time, and I was reasonably familiar with the Workbench interface from an 
ARexx perspective, so I knew a lot of the functionality needed for such a 
toolbar was already there. But with so many other projects that I was 
working on and so little spare time, the concept just stayed parked in my 
mind for years alongside many other ideas. It wasn't until I heard about 
the Amiga Tool Jam that I finally decided to put some time aside and develop 
DrawerGenie.

Originally it was called DrawerCompanion, which was a terrible name, but 
described how it worked in my mind - a companion window that followed 
Workbench windows around, trying to help out when it could. I changed that 
to DrawerHelper when development started to gain momentum and my 
proof-of-concept code showed it might actually work, and I felt that was a 
slightly better name though still pretty unimaginative. It was near the end 
of the Jam that I was trying to come up with an icon for the program, and 
my wife said "Why not just call it DrawerGenie and draw a magic lamp?" And 
that's why it was renamed DrawerGenie in the final days of the Jam!

@{b}5. Why did you choose to create it for OS3.2+ and not 2.1/3.1 systems?@{ub}

Well, it will work on any OS3.5+ Workbench, which includes 3.9, 3.1.4 and 
3.2. But support for earlier Workbench versions isn't really something I 
can do because earlier versions simply lack a lot of the functionality that 
DrawerGenie uses. OS3.5 was a huge overhaul of Workbench (internal version 
44), and as well as the more obvious improvement like a new icon system, 
gave it a new API through workbench.library as well as an ARexx port for 
the first time. All subsequent versions of Workbench are based on the OS3.5 
version, and while there are minor changes and bugfixes, they all support 
the same API and ARexx port. DrawerGenie uses both the workbench.library 
API v44 and the ARexx port heavily, and simply can't work without them. 
That means to be able to do the same thing on Workbench 3.1 or earlier, 
workbench.library would have to be heavily patched to gain access to the 
internal features that are available in later versions, and that sort of 
patching, as well as risking the stability of the OS, is also beyond my 
skill level. So for the foreseeable future anyway, DrawerGenie will only 
work on OS 3.5 or newer.

@{b}6. Were there any features that you wanted to include but could not/did not 
   have enough time?@{ub}

Oh yes, many! I had a list of features I wanted to include, and worked 
through them during development. The basic core features are all there, but 
there are some features that I couldn't do. For example, I wanted the option 
to have DrawerGenie automatically attach a toolbar to a Workbench window 
when it opens (currently a hotkey needs to be pressed to attach a toolbar to 
a window), but that requires patching of the OS so DrawerGenie is aware of 
any windows being opened. That's not a thing I've ever done before and I 
wasn't able to get that feature working before the deadline, so it wasn't 
included. The other main feature I wanted to include but simply ran out of 
time, was more flexible toolbars so the user can select different styles. 
Currently this can be done by swapping in a new toolbar.iff file, but the 
palette remapping isn't handled and the size is fixed at 16x16 for each 
icon, which is quite limited. Support for different sizes of icon, and for 
the excellent AISS image library, is something I want to add in the near 
future.

@{b}7. What programming language did you use to create DrawerGenie?@{ub}

DrawerGenie was actually developed in Blitz Basic, specifically the open-
source follow-on of Blitz Basic called AmiBlitz 3. This version of Blitz 
Basic provides a much nicer environment to code in than Blitz Basic 2.1, as 
well as providing many useful includes that act as wrappers for the OS 
libraries, simplifying their use. AmiBlitz is still actively developed, and 
is very highly backwards compatible with code written for Blitz 2.1, while 
also providing some useful new features like variable declaration checking 
and enforcing, dynamically assigned list arrays, variable parameter counts 
for functions and more. However, the AmiBlitz 3 environment is also more 
demanding than the Blitz 2.1 version, and so it requires a more powerful 
Amiga. It also helps a lot to use a high resolution (e.g. RTG) screenmode 
to make full use of the AmiBlitz features. So for developing on an Amiga 
with any less than a 68030, using Blitz 2.1 (ideally the Ultimate 2.1+ 
CD image) is probably a better option. It's worth mentioning though that 
the requirements of the executables produced are the same, and depend on 
the code rather than the development environment.

For anyone interested in Blitz Basic, I have some information available at 
blitzbasic.info including example code and guides on the fundamentals of 
the language from "Hello World" up to GUI creation for system-friendly 
software and graphics handling for games.

@{b}8. Do you have plans for other software beyond DrawerGenie?@{ub}

I always have a head full of ideas for games and applications I want to 
write, as well as hardware I want to design and build. Unfortunately, I 
simply don't have enough time to pursue most of these ideas, but I always 
have a couple of projects on the go. Outside of DrawerGenie, my current 
project is Solas, a clockport card that gives the Amiga control of RGB 
lighting, fans, temperature sensors, LCD screens and more. This is a mixture 
of hardware, firmware and software development with the Amiga-side software 
also written in Blitz Basic while the firmware is written in C and assembly. 
It's nearing completion now, and once that's done I have updates to 
SMBMounter that I want to make, new features to add to DrawerGenie (and look 
into OS4 compatibility since that doesn't appear to work properly), a couple 
of ideas for games I want to write and so much more. I just need to win lots 
of money so I can give up my day job :)

@{b}Interview - Miguel Fides: Trinity@{ub} by @{"Timo Paul" link timopaul}
============================================================================

@{b}1. Hi Miguel, thank you for agreeing to this interview, can you please 
   introduce yourself?@{ub}

Hi, I was an amiga user back in its hey day. I had an A500 and then an A4000
, which I kept using well past the Pentium PC times. I was working in a 
small computer store back then and considered PCs "just job". Since then, I 
made a career in embedded programming and left the retro scene for many 
years, until 6 years ago. I moved to the country and, as I had a lot of 
spare time, I took some broken amiga computers I had came across and tried 
to repair them as a slow hobby. My A1000 was damaged beyond repair so I 
decided to start with a full board replacement...
 
@{b}2. How did you get started with the Amiga?@{ub}

My father bought me an a500 in 1989. Some school friends got an a500 too and 
then I knew some more people that still are some of my best friends today...

@{b}3. You are working on the Trinity card, what project(s) did you work on 
   before it?@{ub}

My first retro project was the A1100 replacement board. It quickly evolved 
from a simple A500-in-A1000 form factor to a feature-rich board with some 
ideas I had (a simple scan doubler based on SRAM, an 68020 with 32 bit fast 
ram, a replacement "gary" with ide interface and, finally, an A1200 
compatible expansion slot). By the time I knew the famous Edu Arana and 
shared a lot to knowledge with brought a lot of shared small but clever 
boards we worked together. I always try to keep the look and feel of the 
first 90s hardware, so when we saw some simple 030 boards appear we decided 
to make a retro-looking 030 as cheap as possible but with the then-preferred 
expandable and "filled" look of the old days. We made the Tsunami 030. Now 
we have lots of parallel projects, not enough time to complete them in 
reasonable time.

@{b}4. Why did you decide to create the Trinity card?@{ub}

When I was testing had the Tsunami boards in the A1100, I had some tricks 
in the A1100 board which made debugging of accelerators a lot easier and I 
had two spare 060 chips with I had in a (failed) accelerator project for 
A500 so I took a newer approach to an accelerator with was not the simple 
way I had used in the Tsunami. I planned an 040-PCI/PCI-Amiga double bridge 
where I could try additional hardware with DMA and designed a board which I 
could fit and test in the A1100 (and A1200 later). I called it "Trinity" 
because the dual-bridge plus FPGA. 

@{b}5. What unforeseen hurdles/difficulties have you encountered during 
   development?@{ub}

Well it's by a large margin the most complex retro project I've done. There 
are lots of difficulties which make it somewhat similar of a small embedded 
SOC of today, centered on a state-of-the-art 90's CPU instead of a todays's 
32bit core. We have DMA both in SDRAM and to-from Amiga. Some processing 
possible inside of the FPGA and peripherals for i2s (audio), i2c (which is 
used for an audio mixer), spi (this is issued for FPGA self upgrade), etc.  

@{b}6. What aspects have been easier than you had anticipated?@{ub}

Well, easier than anticipated, I can't remember none right now...

@{b}7. There are many new accelerators available for the A1200 now, what sets 
   your card apart from the others?@{ub}

As I said before, there are the requirements that I like to keep in every 
project: keep the look and the feeling of true retro hardware and maximize 
the performance of whatever is is really in the board. We don't use higher 
integration or manufacturing technology. We use the building blocks which 
were used in the 90s, no newer CPUs while bringing the highest performance 
from old stuff available. In addition to that, we sport full DMA 16/24 bit 
audio in/out with mixer (AHI). 

@{b}8. The PiStorm is one card that has become very popular, why did you choose 
   to create a card that uses a real 040/060 instead of the cheaper 
   Raspberry Pi or FPGA?@{ub}

Well, it's my personal view of retro. For this kind of board, I'm not 
looking for for maximum raw performance. I want to see my 040/060 run faster 
than ever. If there is no old hardware involved then it's in a different 
league, closer to my PC or a Pi running UAE...

@{b}9. The onboard sound card is a very unique idea, what made you decide to 
   include a sound card instead of RTG graphics?@{ub}

Back in the day I had a Cybervision 64 in my A4000, and I agree that it was 
very useful and many thought that it was the path to go. Looking back I 
think that a powerful CPU driving a frame buffer makes all contenders equal, 
not what the Amiga was in its glory days. I know that the Amiga video 
capabilities are very limited compared to retargetted graphics but, hey, 
this is retro, I was looking to faster A1100/1200, and A1100 isn't even AGA 
and it's okay. Maybe we (will) end up adding some video output but its not a 
priority for me.

@{b}10. Are there any additional features you hope to add in the future?@{ub}

Well, I'd like to add some sort on expansion slot like we did on the Tsunami 
but we have other issues before we can release the board for more testers.

@{b}11. Which type of user are you targeting the card at?@{ub}

I think that the board is a nice-looking card which feels and looks retro
Amiga that provides the highest performance. We put our soul into it and 
everybody should be able to enjoy it.

@{b}12. What has the response been like from the Amiga community?@{ub}

Well I get a lot of positive feedback from all the boards I've done. There 
are a lot of Amiga active users and collectors and a big part of them seem 
to share our view of function, quality and good-looking (hardware) that we 
try to put in our designs.

@{b}13. Do you have plans to develop hardware for other Amiga models or 
    computers?@{ub}

We have a lot of prototypes that comprise all the Amiga models. Most of them 
are due to (the) clever view of Edu and we usually share resources to help 
bringing the project forward. As I said, we can't do them all so we focus 
on a single project to finish when possible.

@{b}14. How do you see the Amiga scene developing in the next 5 years?@{ub}

I think that we are in a new time of expanding possibilities brought both by 
new performance levels for classic Amigas and new developments of system 
software. They both help to brings back the focus to native development on 
the Amiga. Thats really exciting to me because that makes the Amiga somewhat 
more appealing for what I like. I hope that more development in the 
high-performance 68k Amigas and more available development tools pave the 
way for more actually used Amigas both for gaming and native development, 
thus more new hardware diversity and refinement.

@{b}15. Being an Amiga user, do you have many Amigas, if so which one is your 
    favorite and why?@{ub}

I try to have at least one of every Amiga model and I almost have, even if 
some are not 100% good looking or complete. My favorite, of course is my 
A1000 with the A1100 replacement board and Trinity 060 because it's custom 
made to my preferences :)

I happen to have my original A4000/CyberStorm060 too, but I don't use it as 
often because I don't have much space for it.

@{b}16. Thank you for your time, before we finish do you have any final words or 
    requests to the Amiga community?@{ub}

I'd like to share the good emotions that we have got in the recent years. We 
all have some sort of nostalgia but with the Amiga we have achieved great 
success in bringing the system back to use and enjoyment.

@{b}News from Invent@{ub}

Amiga Art Contest 2023
By the time you read this Doug and I will be busy looking over all the 
entrants for this year's Amiga Art Contest, good luck everyone :) I 
have managed to submit two fun animations to this year's contest :)

@{b}Boss Machine@{ub}

Boss Machine will be the last @{b}Amiga Classic@{ub} game I will make, so I 
will be doing my very best effort. Dan and I plan on doing a live stream 
soon on Dan's youtube:

=> https://www.youtube.com/@BossMachineAmiga/videos

More assets have been created and my focus at this time has been the level 
selector screen, designing planets, screenshot thumbnails of the levels.  
Dan's very cool sprite editor have even more features, very organic spline 
controls for not only building big Bosses but paths for smaller enemies. 

I'm very impressed at what this engine can do.

@{b}Apollo-X@{ub}

Some time has been spent on the shoot 'em up for Vampire Amigas and before 
the end of the year will have some new screenshots on my Patreon Blog.  Our 
team is always very busy not only improving the ApolloOS but looking into 
future projects, hardware and software. At this stage Apollo-X is moving 
forward nicely, I am currently creating all the assets for the 
@{b}SKYRobots@{ub} level, a very mechanical scenario in space. The 
Foreground tileset is 1024x1024 pixels, which gives plenty of room for 
creative design.  I'm aiming at purely 2 parallax layers but in the Tiled 
Map Editor it is actually 4.  The reason for this is I can create a lot more 
complexity and variation by overlapping different tiles.  I'm really excited 
about this 2 player shoot 'em up. 

@{b}AmigaKit A600 GS - Amigakit@{ub}

Now that the A600 GS is in the open-public, recently shown at Amiwest 2023. 
I would like to mention that I am enjoying being part of this project. 
Recent work includes helping design the GUI - menu system as well as various 
branding and promotional materials. As you can imagine most info is under an 
NDA but as it becomes public, I can share more and I usually only post this 
info on my blog.  Currently working on further promotional materials and 
sincerely wish Amigakit great success for this exciting project.

@{b}Reshoot Proxima III@{ub}

You may have now noticed our 3rd and final game for the Reshoot series is 
now released. AmigaBill had a recent live stream on his Twitch Channel which 
was a lot of fun having the 3 main team members.  For me It was 4am in the 
morning so I was not on camera and in the chat only.  My office is part of 
the bedroom/study so it was difficult to be camera. We are extremely proud 
of this project and hope to enjoy it as much as we loved creating it.  For 
me, I wanted to create a more grungier style over say a cleaner/pixel 
perfect look. Richard certainly deserves a lot of credit overall.

@{b}Possible new Vampire Project - Dungeon Crawler game@{ub}

I have some posted news on my Patreon of some behind the scenes work on a 
Dungeon Crawler game for all Vampire Amigas.  The game will be a hybrid of 
3D dungeon and 2D rendered sprites. I'm fairly new to this project and 
currently testing out different software to create the characters.

@{b}Projects outside of the Amiga@{ub}

Before I mention future projects (and some are not even listed), this is 
partly why I will not be creating any new Classic Amiga games. Many years 
ago, I have always dreamed of making games for the Amiga, and now after 
being part of 5-6 games, I have ticked that box. As I get older (52), I 
think about what else I would like to do.  I believe the Vampire/Apollo 
Amiga needs more dedicated time to showcase what I believe is the best 
direction for the Amiga. So this is my new focus. 

An important other factor after many years of dedication all my spare 
time and more to the Amiga scene, and I would easily classify myself as 
the hardest/most productive Artist in the scene, my patreon barely gained 
any traction. Thankfully stable at 13 very valuable patrons.  When you 
think of family Life and other things in life to do, maybe its a time for a 
change, other projects and other hobbies.   The good news though is the 
Amiga scene is thriving, not as much as I would like to see but lots of 
great projects now and on the horizon.

So with that news, below is a list of games I am also working on, all games 
are for PC below. My Brother Ian and I are very close to having our 
Boulderdash/Emerald Mine clone @{b}FruityCaves@{ub} nearly complete. NOVA 
and Thrusterz 2 that i'm working with James is getting ever closer.

@{b}Ian Saunders@{ub} - Fruity Caves, Dragons Gold, Adrenaline Racer, RPG 
Shooter, Fatal Danger, Under Threat, Deep-Blue, Tank-Pong

@{b}James Roberts@{ub} - Thrusters 2, Iridium 2, Ultra Galaga, NOVA

After all of these projects, I think I need a good rest.  :)

Till next time,

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}

  My journey with the Amiga started in either '87/'88 when the family got an
  A500 (Back then it was a computer for the whole family), I remember the 
  monitor and A500 boxes almost being as high as myself. Before this time I
  had only been exposed to the ZX Spectrum and C64, using the blue Workbench
  for the first time was an amazing experience. When I saw DigiPaint in
  action I could not believe my eyes. From that moment I was a devoted Amiga
  user going through various Amigas, A500+A570, A600, A3000 and A1200. Over
  the years my Amiga has been used to creating digital artwork and for 
  making or shall I say trying to make music. Then in the year 2021 I decided
  for some crazy reason that the Amiga scene needed a digital magazine 
  similar to Amiga Report. It was my intention to have something that picked
  up where the great Amiga magazines such as Amiga World and Amazing 
  Computing left off, providing a more serious look at Amiga usage through
  tutorials and reviews.

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}

  Like many Amiga users my first computer addiction was the mighty 
  Commodore 64! One day close to Christmas of 1986 I drove to my local 
  Commodore store called Comspec...I was in high school and played rep 
  hockey at the time and didn't have the time I used to when I was in grade 
  school to visit Comspec each weekend to check out the latest magazine and 
  games. Imagine my surprise when I stepped into the store and immediately in 
  front of me was THE AMIGA! It was looping the Defender of The Crown intro 
  and I fell in love instantly! From that day on it was my mission to buy 
  that Amiga but I had just worked a few part time jobs to help pay for my 
  first ever used car and didn't have a hundred bucks to my name lol. The 
  Amiga was close to $2,000 Canadian dollars (after taxes) and unlike my
  C64 my parents didn't fall for the 'I need it for school' rant again.

  To (try) to make a very long story short I didn't save up to buy my Amiga 
  until I started University in 1989. In the mean time I saw another Amiga 
  called the Amiga 500 at Comspec and it was a lot cheaper than THE AMIGA 
  but my eyes and heart and soul were only set on THE AMIGA! When I finally 
  bought it that was the proudest/happiest moment I've ever felt and I 
  jumped straight into University with Excellence! word processor and 
  Logistix spreadsheet/ database. In my 2nd year I bought my first ever 
  hard drive, a whopping 33MB which had its own case which sat atop my 
  Amiga 1000 case. Later fast ram side cars showed up and I mingled with 
  Manx Aztec C compiler in computer science class. Of course all the great 
  games with awesome music/sound effects made my Apple/PC friends envious!

  By my 3rd year we had a small Amiga computer club and a few of us got our 
  first accelerator boards for our Amiga which was called LUCAS and was 
  based on a design in a Transactor magazine. It had a 68020 at 16 MHz with 
  FPU on it and it really helped out with the more complicated spreadsheets 
  and compiling programs. Life was good, the internet was just starting up, 
  I graduated University and got my first full time job and then the bad 
  news of Commodore going bankrupt hit the newspapers, magazines, and BBS 
  boards! There was so much activity going on still in user groups and 
  computer stores so us Amiga users just figured that it would sort itself 
  out. At work  there were only PC's running AutoCAD and I despised using 
  the early Windows systems and couldn't wait to get back home to my Amiga. 
  Over the years busy with work and 'adult life' many of my Amiga friends 
  moved on to PCs and I ended up getting my first Amiga 1200 and later 
  Amiga 4000 for great prices. I was still amazed how the Amiga community 
  was still active and so helpful up to the early 2000's. By then I was 
  married and working harder than ever to save up to buy a home instead of 
  renting an apartment and my Amiga's were left at my parents house until 
  around 2010 or so I read about a brand new Amiga which was coming out 
  based on PPC CPU called the AmigaONE X1000 running a new AmigaOS4. I was 
  skeptical at first after hearing about the technical issues with the 
  earlier SE, XE boards with the initisal AmigaOS4 release but after 
  consulting with some friends I joined the beta test team to get one of 
  the first X1000 boards and I immediately felt at home with AmigaOS4.1 
  and have used it as my home Amiga ever since. Once I got some space set 
  up in my house I got my Amiga's out of my parents house finally and 
  eventually my original Amiga 1000 sits next to my AmigaONE X1000 and 
  original C64 and of course my Amiga 1200 and 4000 came along too and with 
  new accelerator cards and ram boards and spare motherboards and parts 
  etc etc etc. Here I am today grateful to the Amiga computer and 
  especially to the amazing Amiga community who back then and today has 
  always been resilient, creative and helpful !

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}

  My journey with the Amiga started around 1988, The first time seeing the 
  Amiga 1000 in the shop window playing animations such as the @{b}Amiga Juggler@{ub}
  I fondly remember. My Brother and I saved up for an A500, and eventually 
  bought an A4000 (cybervision 64 card) and then an A1200 with an 030 
  accelerator. I loved collecting every Amiga Magazine with demo disks. My 
  interest in game designing for the Amiga started with deluxe paint and 
  I did dabble with @{b}The Miracle Keyboard@{ub} but that skill in music 
  didn't last. It is because of the Amiga that I now work in video 
  animation and game design.

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}

  Danish Amiga fan since the 90s. Started with a 1200 and a 1200 is my 
  machine today. I am interested in the casual and the philosophical 
  aspects of the Amiga computer. 

  My cats enjoy Turrican.

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}

  Rob has been making music on Amiga ever since in the mid to late 90's 
  his guitar teacher suggested that he get a drum machine to practice along 
  to, and he instead opted to use OctaMED on his Amiga 500+ with A590 to 
  craft beats and basslines

  @{b}Bio:@{ub}
  Manical started making music for the Amiga in early 2021 (April) and has 
  released at some demoparties, and is planning to go to more along the 
  way. He's in the demogroups MoonShine and Hokuto Force as a musician, and 
  soon to be a coder or graphician. He started out with Protracker for his 
  first 3 mods, then moved to FastTracker primarily, and then he started 
  exploring Impulse Tracker and started making tracks with Furnace. His 
  songs have gotten good reviews by many famous people in the demoscene, 
  such as Jammer, Purple Motion, Skaven, and cTrix (Most known for his 
  gAtari). Since his music journey, he's entered Syntax 2021, Mysdata 2022, 
  Boozedrome VI (Which his track that he entered ended up on the official 
  Boozedrome tape which was limited to 50 copies).

  help each other and not hurt each other.'
