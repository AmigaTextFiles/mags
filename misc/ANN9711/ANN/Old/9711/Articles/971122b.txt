On the "68k-The Next Generation" issue, I was reading my latest copy
of the CUCUG Newsletter, *The Status Register*, and there was a
re-print of a story from the "National Capital Amiga Users Group
newsletter, *Active Window*, written by Carl Sassenrath, labeled
"Sinking Ships."

In the story, Mr.Sassenrath more-or-less talks of his wishes for a 68k
processor that ran at 200-300MHz.  While he acknowledges the "intended
benefits" of the PPC, he argues that Motorola should not have dropped
development of the 68k line of processors.

He argues that "Nothing Beats Speed," and that a 68k Processor, if it
was fast enough, would satisfy people dispite any processor design
issues, siteing Intel as an example.  :)

In the story, he states that he mentioned this opinion to Ted Wait in
a meeting last May, suggesting that if anyone could get Motorola to
start up on the 68k processors again, it was Gateway 2000.

Now then, in the story, he acknowledges that he does not know if any
of this has gone beyond that, and it is quite possible that this
entire idea was derived simply from this suggestion, and that the
conversations going on here in the newsgroups about 68k-TNG are simply
being driven forward by this suggestion.

Is it possible that GW2k will get Motorola to design a faster 68k?  I
don't know, but I do know that, currently, we don't have enough
information one way or the other to really know if such a thing is
even being considered.

It may be fun to speculate on, though.   :)
