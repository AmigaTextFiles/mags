This is what the report said:

There is no decision yet which CPU shall be used in the new Amiga
line.Tyschtschenko made a pretty surprising statement: He would like most a
Motorola 68060 or 68080 at 200 MHz in a new Amiga. He pointed out the advantage
of being able to use a simple OS upgrade from 3.x instead of a complete
rewrite.
He didn't elaborate whether Motorola would be willing to build such a beast.
Another option, processor-wise, would be some sort of cooperation with Phase5
(and the PPC board).

This does not make much sense to me! It's going to be easier to have a
simple OS upgrade that to rewrite it for a new chip??? A chip that does
not exist to my knowledge. This completely dumbfounded me and is almost
unbelievable! If this is not the case then they are going to use an old
slow (by todays standards) like the 68060..which I don't think is even
being produced anymore!

HOW is it going to be easier for Motorola to gear back up and 
produce a chip that they abandoned a couple of years ago than to rewrite the 
OS for a newer more powerful chip! PLEASE tell me this isn't correct. This 
could not possibly be true! 

I've wept for hours! :(
