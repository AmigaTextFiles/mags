Yes, absolutely it will still be available on Aminet.  It's one of our
primary distribution channels.  In fact (and here's something else one or
two people have taken time out to gripe at me for) AR is not including
GIFs because of Aminet's moratorium on the format.  It's perhaps not the
best solution for us to always use JPEGs, but I can't ignore how important
Aminet is to our distribution, so I'll persevere.

Incidentally, while we've got all this talk going about AR, I'll be
announcing details of the revived Amiga Report notification list, for
those who do not want to receive the issue in their mailbox but want to
know when they should check web sites or Aminet for a new issue.
