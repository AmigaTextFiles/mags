A typical slandering Ortmann: DCE normally is not known for joking,
but for serious designs. And they are very competent in this after
my experience. As an example see the SX-32. And to add more anecdotal
evidence for their comptence: They were the ones who received those
70 A4000T's, which left Commodore manufacturing in last second before
closing, where none of them worked, investigated the problem and
detected a timing problem and succeeded to make half of those machines
work, so that they could be sold.
