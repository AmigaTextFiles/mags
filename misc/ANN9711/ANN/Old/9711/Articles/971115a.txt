Yes, you are.  The "CD-ROM driver" in the "Storage/DOSDrivers" drawer is
not actually a driver - that drawer name is rather misleading.  You need
to get hold of a replacement driver for the IDE bus that can handle
CD-ROM drives as well as hard drives.  There are two commercial products
available which provide this - IDEfix97 and the "Plug'n'Play ATAPI
CD-ROM" driver.  IDEfix97 also supports some other newer IDE features
needed to make use of an IDE Zip drive.  You could also get the beta v43
IDE driver from Amiga International's FTP site - which is what I did.
This requires OS 3.1 and needs a little fiddling with your
startup-sequence, so it's not for the faint-hearted; however, since you
have already opened up and fiddled around with the internals of your
A4000 I think you are not one of them.

Aaargh!  I just checked and ftp.amiga.de seems to be screwed up.  It
looks like AI's ISP (Welfen-Netz) has been moving things around and
currently www.amiga.de = amiga.amiga.de is providing FTP service for
some PC supplier while ftp.amiga.de has no public FTP service at all!
I did a little investigation:

These are the two hosts in the amiga.de domain:

amiga.amiga.de (alias www.amiga.de) has address 194.112.110.240.  The
machine that actually corresponds to this address is normally called
rs-main.welfen-netz.com and has address 194.112.110.1.  It is running
Windows NT and NT's standard FTP service.  The route from here
(ox.ac.uk) to amiga.amiga.de goes through AT&T lines and then through
Cybernet AG's lines.

amiga2.amiga.de (alias ftp.amiga.de) has address 194.231.42.152.  The
machine that actually corresponds to this address is normally called
www4.mediaserve.de and has address 194.231.42.253.  It is running UNIX
and wu-ftpd.  The route from here to amiga2.amiga.de goes through AT&T
lines and then through DPN's lines.  It seems to me that its name record
is entirely incorrect.

The name servers for amiga.de are rs-main.welfen-netz.com (the ISP's
main (or only?) machine, it seems) and ns.cybernet-ag.net (the upstream
provider's name server).  Since I'm currently in the situation of
dealing with one ISP maintaining name records and another looking after
the actual addresses myself, I can see how these sorts of things can
happen.  But it doesn't look good at all.

Now, watch me try out their mail server:

The failure to accept mail to postmaster@amiga.de is a serious breach of
Internet standards!  The other information might be of use... I would
assume the AOL accounts exist to allow easy access from around the
world, which tells us which of the staff are chained to their desks... ;-)

I guess it's time to mail the webmaster then...
