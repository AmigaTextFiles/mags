Define 'set-top-box'! There are at least as mant definations as there
are marketing people. ;)

I've heard report that said the CD32 was a failure, with the implication
that the hardware was somehow wrong. What those reporters fail to
realize is that by the time Commodore started shipping the CD32 into the
states, they (CBM) were only a few months from bankruptcy. I personally
know of a potential OEM order for CD32's that numbered in the hundred's
of thousands that died because of CBM's inability to guarantee the
supply.
