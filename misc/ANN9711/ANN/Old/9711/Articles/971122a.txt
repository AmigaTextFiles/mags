We sold over 7,000 to commercial applications.  It had the benefit of 
being a cheap base machine (certainly cheap after C= dumped them), which 
could be expanded with application specific hardware.  We have built our 
Access to continue the supply for this market.

I went along today to install a couple of CD32+MPEG on HMS Belfast, an old 
WWII battleship on the River Thames in the heart of London.  There are now 
about 10 or 11 machine there, they run almost 24 hours per day with very 
few problems delivering video in loops, with IR triggering or touch screen 
selection.  Great bits of kit, the CD mechanism can be a bit fussy and the 
MPEG runs egg frying hot, but still very versatile.
