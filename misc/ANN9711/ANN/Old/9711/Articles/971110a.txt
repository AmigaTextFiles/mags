This site seems to be a blatant rip-off of AmiBench ; 

I dont know why they have done what they have done, this is stepping on
the toes of AmiBench,
they could of very easly directed their members to AmiBench. 

This is not just about their 'New Service' ...... 

heres our top three reasons why ; 

A, They seem to dislike my attempts to get Press Releases on their site,
I've sent 3 press releases
and only one has ever been shown in the news pages/new links. 

B, They blantantly Rip off other peoples/groups ideas. 

C, They are very very selective in what they allow, they refused
AmiBench 4 times. 

I have spent 7 months on and off to get AmiBench running, its only now
its been used, I hardly
think the AWD has played much part in helping us. 

For a User Group of Amiga users I find their behavour very very odd, as
they seem to hinder more
than help the Amiga Community.

Just thought I'd make the point that, even though tecno seems to think
he has had his page ripped off, he neglects to mention that his page was
infact my idea that he ripped off from my www page. It was my idea that
I suggested (seeing as I already had it up and running) to him and a
friend for a large amiga Site we were to setup (which wasn't tecno's
idea but my friends) when work meant that my friend and I had to drop
out, tecno decided to copy the ideas we had come up with and make his
own page with absolutley no mention to us. Oh and if you read the
Opening statement on his page it is the biggest pile of bullsh*t.

So tecno before you accuse other people of ripping you off try to
remember who you ripped off in the past.

I posting this because I never said anything before when he stole my
ideas because there was no point, there is no place for wars or stupid
competion in the Amiga community so I said nothing and lived with it, I
even shut down my page. But for some reason tecno seems to think he is
the only one who has a right to make a adverts page, so I'm writing this
in support of the Amiga Web Directory, they did nothing wrong just made
a good addition to the page which (uncannily enough) I was about to
suggest they do. I think this attack on AWD is unfair, unjust and
without reason The AWD is one of the best Amiga News and Links sites
there is, and I hope you can all see that the tecno's statement is
completely untrue

Sorry had to get that off my chest, you wouldn't believe how angry it
made me to see that pack of lies,

cheers,
