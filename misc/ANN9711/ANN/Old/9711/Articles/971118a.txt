I don't know but everybody is going mad about what Petro said he would
like to a visitor of the fair.
Did somebody read Olaf Barthel's post about the developers meeting?
If you know that the roadmap would be presented at 7 P.M and you know
that the fair closed at 6P.M than it is clear that there was no roadmap
presentation during the openinghours.
And Olaf pointed out that Petro didn't talk about 060's etc.
It's something HE wanted to have and that's O.K if there where any.
It would be nice to have while they are porting the O.S to another Chip.
So please don't panic, it's to early let's wait for some official news
or a detailed report from the developers meeting, and let them choose
that processor quick.
greetings,
Alf
