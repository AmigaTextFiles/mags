   While I don't agree with the idea of shipping something labeled "3.5" just to
show that something is happening there was something peculiar about this
announcement: they just named 1998 as the release year, but with no specific
date. The reason being that R&D has to be up and running until any committment
to a specific development roadmap for this update could be made.

   Oh, come on. The speech Jeff Schindler gave at the Cologne show was
just about the facts that could be proven and for which enough background
information was available to reach a decision. The plans he talked about
include a technology plan for the next three years, which is something
Commodore never seemed to have had. This talk was not about how an operating
system update should look like and when it should be shipping. This was just
a very small item on the list. Rather, the talk was about the current situation
(including an analysis of the strength and weaknesses of the platform) and the
next steps to be taken towards R&D work, product development and OEM licensing
(proper licensing, not the kind of "license to build junk" we have today)
I really was expecting a lot less than that, we all remember what little
Petro said in so many words at previous occasions. In the end, I was quite
satisfied with the content of the speech and the gathering of developers
following it. I am no good at remembering details that I did not expect or
consider irrelevant, so you should better wait for the press releases and
comments to make the rounds. I would expect them for Monday or Tuesday.

   Luckily, Petro kept quiet about the areas we was not involved in and
understands little about. He gave his usual talk about of how great and
bright things were looking and made a plea to stop illegal use of Amiga
trademarks and material. In my opinion, his statements were largely a
rehash of the usual pointless drivel he gives at such shows. If anything
was said about the "68060", it must have been after the speeches were
made and probably not by anyone who knows his trade.

   Actually, the developer feedback Amiga, Inc. collected shows that the
developer community favours the PowerPC (1st place) and the Alpha (2nd place)
families as the next generation Amiga CPU, the 68k family came only 3rd.
