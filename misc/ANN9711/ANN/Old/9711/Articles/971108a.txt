Rumour has it, Phase5 are working on a quad PPC750 board at the
moment.. apparently Newtek are quite interested in it.

For those uneducated :), speed tests have shown the 270/300Mhz
PPC750's (cant remember which) to be over twice as fast as the
PentiumII 233MHz at some tasks.. while in others they were a little
slower..

Interesting, yeah? :)
