IMO, people with PC's are happy because they are TOLD they are happy,
and don't know any different-classic doublethink, as in Orwell's 1984
("Winston, did you hear productivity is up this year 15%-by the way, got
any spare razor blades? Store's out of them."). 

Almost everone I know bitches like crazy about the things their PC's do,
and keep buying new ones every two years! Then I show them my 4000, and
they say, "Oh-I didn't know a computer could do THAT!" 

Read Vance Packard's The Hidden Persuaders sometime-it'll make you
wonder why you do almost everything you do. With enough PR, lies, and
money, it's possible to convince most people that the world's flat to
the point they'll fall off the edge! 

I remember hearing an Apple rep say to a guy that full screen, full
motion animation wasn't possible yet (!). I stepped in and said '"unless
you have an Amiga." The guy said "what?" The rep replied, through
gritted teeth, "except on the Amiga." How many times do you think stuff
like this happens where there is no one to contradict the lies? BTW, I
was insufferably pleased with myself after that!
