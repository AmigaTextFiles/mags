Dear Loyal NewTek Customer:

Well, I am pleased to see that the passion for NewTek and our products is
still strong. However, I do believe that a number of misconceptions are
brewing. I'd like to take the time to address these issues to all of you so
that you have a clear picture of where NewTek stands.

At NewTek Expo last month a statement was made during the dealer meeting on
Sunday afternoon that referred to NewTek's Amiga development being "on
hold." NewTek is in the desktop video development business, today, and for
the last 10 years the Amiga has been the most suitable computer for this
development. Now that the Amiga is in the hands of Gateway 2000 we are
evaluating our next move. Gateway provides us with the potential to pursue a
number of different avenues of development, some obvious, others less so. I
am in conversation on virtually a daily basis with the folks at Gateway
working on an agreement. One of the first steps taken by Gateway is the
licensing of QuikPak. We have encouraged this association and are please to
see that a dependable supply of equipment, parts and warranty service will
be available to all Amiga users.

As for our commitment to you, our customers, NewTek's mission has always
been to provide our customers with the most powerful tools possible at a
price that is affordable. This approach has resulted in a significantly
large number of people being able to enter careers and make a living doing
something they enjoy where it may not have been possible otherwise. Since
our move to San Antonio we have committed substantial additional resources
to improving our customer service. The Technical Support staff has doubled
in size and over half of that team has a focus on nothing but Toaster and
Flyer issues. Additionally, we have numerous Amiga programmers on staff
working on future developments.

One of the other business components that NewTek has committed a great deal
of resources to is third party development. For many customers one of the
most appealing aspects of the NewTek line of products is the wealth of
support from third party developers that provides additional capabilities
and depth of functionality to our products. We welcome and encourage this
support and expect to see much more development from this arena on the
Toaster and Flyer, in addition to LightWave.

We remain committed to Amiga technology and believe the future holds the
potential for more great things. We have never stopped believing in or
supporting the Amiga, our users, or the creative talent that finds ways to
use or improve our technology.

As always, we appreciate the high value that you place on NewTek and our
products. It is absolutely our mission, in fact our passion, to make sure
that you have the most powerful, exciting tools possible and still at a
price that makes our competitors crazy.

Dwight Parscale
President and CEO
NewTek Partners, LP
