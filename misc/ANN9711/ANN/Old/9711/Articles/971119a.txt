The quote from AInc at the devcon went something like "we're not in the products
business, we're in the technology business".  I thought that compared well to
the Commodore situation were the engineers and their professional enthusiasm
pushed the core technical development ahead, the difference being that
management's ability to stall or cancel technical development is greatly
reduced.

And there certainly was a lot of professional enthusiasm, plus ample opportunity
for productive informal contact with the AInc/AInt people.  Did you know for
instance that the real Boing Ball has 8 by 8 facets and is tilted right by 18
degrees, that it is a polygon rather than being perfectly round, and that the
facet directly above and to the right of the central point should be red and
perfectly square?  There was heated debate over this, as well as over whether
Jeff Schindler pronounced Boing correctly.  I gave him the third-degree about
this, but he denied ever having said "Boeing Ball".  I have witnesses to the
contrary, but they will remain anonymous.

Back to the new Amiga business model, my recollection of what was said is that
there will be three main entities:

 - Amiga International, Incorporated ("Amiga Inc.", I think :) drives
   development for a broad range of markets, possibly with a more diversified
   palette of OS configurations.

 - Amiga International licenses the use of this technology.  I don't remember
   whether they were supposed to produce and sell individual products as well.
   Petro seemed to have a lot of strategic tete-a-tetes with various Amiga
   developers.  This and other things left me with the impression that AInc and
   AInt cooperated to get and maintain a good overview of what's happening both
   inside and outside of the Amiga world.

 - The ICOA will be in charge of customer/public relations.  Whereas AInc would
   support major developers directly, ICOA would take care of the little fish
   (no pun intended Fred, honest!).  An advantage of this separation as I see it
   could be that major developers may have more requirement for individual
   support, eg. where possible new application areas of the Amiga platform would
   require modifications to the OS.  Personally I believe that high-requirement
   uses can help drive technical development in meaningful directions.

The way I understood it, this model has not been set in stone yet but has been
thought out into a fair amount of detail and is actively being implemented.  The
AI people struck me as open-minded, but also very practical people.


> Maybe OS 3.5 will be out in the middle of the year.

They were very careful not to promise a date, so what we have is basically "as
soon as we can, obviously within a year, but obviously not within a month".
That makes it somewhere in 1998.  Judging by the version number it will be a
minor upgrade, but the idea is to also bundle software for functions that
weren't previously part of the Amiga OS (eg. networking or web browsing, in part
using existing products).  There seems to be an intention to have frequent OS
releases after that, something like once a year.
