	Don't you hate people who post HTML on usenet?  Apparently the
brainless WinTosh owners use netscape which formats the posts for HTML for
some reason.
	Of course, those of use reading the usenet as if it were ascii text
(which it is supposed to be) get to see a mess of crap.

	Just get Netscape.

	No netscape?  Just get a PC.  get a real machine.


	See the probem?

	If you @{bg shine}must@{bg background} use hypertext in a usenet posting, why not use
Amigaguide?  All of use with Amigas can read it.  If the PC users can't,
they can just get the Amigaguide datatype.

	No datatypes?  Just get an Amiga.  Get a @{bg shine}real@{bg background} machine!

 ;-)
