business model will probably look like this:

<LI>The ICOA will be in charge of customer/public relations, the smaller
developers.

Amiga OS 3.5 was promised for <CITE>somewhere in 1998</CITE>, no exact date
was given. The idea is to bundle (partly already existing) software for
functions that weren't previously part of AmigaOS (networking, web browsing...).

<UL>Jeroen T. Vermeulen posts a report from an imaginary visit to
Intel headquarters. In this vision, CEO Andy Grove explained to
him that MMX meant &quot;Mainly Marketing&quot;, with the X just being
in the term because <CITE>trademarks with the letter X in them are perceived
as 30% more innovative</CITE>. He then adds, that the imaginary
Intel no longer develop technologies, but only trademarks;
since all major profit was only made by glossy buzzwords with
no substance anyway. ;-)
