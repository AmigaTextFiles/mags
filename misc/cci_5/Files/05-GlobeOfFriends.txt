>THE GLOBE OF FRIENDS


Hello!My  name is Quim Cubarsí and I'm a young spanish boy with a lot of
hobbys,specially  I like to write and I have a lot of pen-pals.I have an
idea  that  I  think  that  will  be  interesting  for  a  lot of people
interested  in  found a pen-pal with their same or similar hobbys.I have
created  a club called "The Globe of Friends" and my idea is to create a
huge  database with the addresses and the hobbys from all the menbers to
make  links  betwen them;by example,you like a lot to collect stamps but
you  don't  know  the  address of any people interested in exchange with
you,well  the  only that you have to do is to send your address,name and
hobbyes  and  the  club  will  provide  you a list of addresses of other
people  interested  in  the  same  kind  of  things  that  you like,it's
easy,isn't it?

If  you  want to be a menber of the club the only that you have to do is
to send us a letter or a post-card including:

          *- Your complete name
          *- Your complete address(don't forget post-code)
          *- Your age
          *- Your hobbies

You have to send the post-cards or the letters to:


             Quim Cubarsí Romans
             "The Globe of Friends"
             C/ de l'Oli 3
             17483 Bàscara
             Gerona

I hope that you like the idea and hope to hear from you soon,bye.
