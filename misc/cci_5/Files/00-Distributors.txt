                             To distribute a magazine is a
             very hard work,simply think that actually our
             group  is  distributing  the magazine only in
             the spanish version and we have to distribute
             more  than 500 floppy disk every month in all
             the country.If you want to be our distributor
             you'll  be  the  firts receiving the magazine
             and then you'll distribute it in your country
             easily than us,but remenber that the magazine
             is  PD,you  can ask people for money,only for
             disks  and  stamps to pay the carriage.If you
             want to be our distributor simply contact us.
