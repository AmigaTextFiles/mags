>PentriSoft Information


Welcome  to  PentriSoft!   The details below outline the association and
how  to  join  it.   If  you  decide  that  you do want to join, run the
registration program on the disk.  Here, you can enter information about
yourself,  and  save the file onto a blank floppy to return to me.  More
instructions  are  in  the doc file.  I am interested to know about your
computer set-up, and which programming language(s) you use.

I also wish to know any programs that you may have written so that I can
send  all  members a list of PentriSoft programs.  This list should then
be included with all members' current or future programs, thus providing
some  free  advertising.   Note that it is also important, therefore, to
state  how  much  the  programs cost, or whether they are available from
elsewhere.

Also on this disk:

- The Registration Program and readme

-  Picture  files (IFF format) of the PentriSoft logo.  Feel free to use
them  in  your  programs, and don't hesitate to modify them slightly (eg
size, colour, resolution) to suit your needs.

- A text file of FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) 

- Two sample articles for `Double Click!'; see later for more details

Please note that PentriSoft is in its early stages, but we hope you will
still benefit.

As  a  member of PentriSoft, you can benefit from the following services
free of charge:

- Direct links to other friendly members to share tips and advice

- Beta testing and debugging by users and/or programmers (see later)

-  Advice  on  distribution, interfaces, enhancements, and other program
areas from PentriSoft members

-  The  use of the PentriSoft name and logo in your programs; help us to
build  a  reputation  -  Advertising  of your programs in other members'
programs

We also hope to provide these services, in time:

-  The  right  to have your software checked and awarded the `PentriSoft
mark of quality'

- Distribution opportunities among members and outside the association

- Maybe further 'proper' advertising facilities (at a cost, though!)

If  you have any ideas for things which could be provided by PentriSoft,
then don't hesitate to tell us!

Note  that  copyright  of  all  PentriSoft  programs  remains  with  the
programmer(s) who wrote them.

These  opportunities are available to all members, and to take advantage
of them, just send back the questionnaire supplied to this address:

   Mark Harman
   3 Highlea Close
   St. Leonards on-sea
   East Sussex
   TN37 7SS

 (I have not yet got a modem, so you can't contact me that way...)

When I receive your application, I will do my best to put you in contact
with  programmer(s)  of  the  same  language, and possibly with the same
programming  interests,  but  as  we are fairly new, this will not be as
swiftly happening as I would have liked.

If  you wish, please enclose a sample of your work.  If you wish to give
us  further  information about yourself at this stage, please feel free,
as  it  will  help  all  of  us  to get to know each other.  A bit about
ourselves is provided in the FAQs.

To join PentriSoft, programmers must agree to: 

-  Create  honest,  original  software  which  is,  as  far as possible,
bug-free

- Provide suitable `read me' information or other documentation and some
form of user support

-  Only  use  the PentriSoft name on programs that have been produced in
accordance with these terms

-  Use  the facilities available through PentriSoft honestly and in good
faith

(We  reserve  the right to end a programmer's membership with PentriSoft
at any time, should we feel the need to.)

We now have the beginnings of a beta testing service; send your programs
to PentriSoft's first beta tester, Rob Forster, at this address:

   Rob Forster
   234 Hillside Road
   Hastings
   East Sussex
   TN34 2QT

 Or  send  them via me.  His system is an A500+, 1MB, Workbench 2.04, no
hard  disk,  so  please  bear this in mind when sending programs.  Also,
state  any  particular areas that you wish to be tested specifically, or
whether  you  just want a general testing.  Please make sure you send an
SAE for his reply.  He asks for no payment, just his name in the credits
of  your  program, and that you remember him if you make vast amounts of
money from it...

If  you  wish  to become a PentriSoft beta tester, then please write and
tell me!

Also,  we  may  be  starting  a  disk  magazine, possibly called `Double
Click!',  about  PentriSoft  and  programming.   Feel  free  to  send in
contributions;  we  need all the articles we can get!  Source code would
be  useful  too  (though make sure its well commented).  On the disk are
two example articles.  See the FAQs for more information.

NB:   This  text  file  and  the  FAQs are freely distributable, but the
PentriSoft  name  and logo are ONLY to be used in programs of registered
PentriSoft  members.   Note that you don't have to send us your programs
for  evaluation  or  anything  just to release them under the PentriSoft
name.
