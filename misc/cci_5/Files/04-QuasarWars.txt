A new star has born,the spanish group Light Desings has programmed a new
Amiga  game,it's  the  firts game of the group but it's spectacular it's
possible one of the best shoot'em'up games of the last times.

The  game  have  a  lot  of  features,a very smooth scroll,50 frames per
second,intelligent enemies,beautiful GFX and music,360 degrees rotations
and  more.And  it's  compatible  with all the Amiga computers.One of the
best  features  of  the  game  is  the  speed,because  the game is 100 %
programed  in  assembler  and  it  gives  a lot of speed to the game,the
control  system has a bit of dificultty but with 2 or three games you'll
be able to control the game easily.It's a very playable game and you can
stay  for  hours  playing  it,in fact I was for more than 5 hours when I
tested the game.
