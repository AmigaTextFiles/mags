Greetings!   I  thought I'd say Hi and tell you all about NFA's ace mag,
The Word, now in it's 10th issue and with issue 11 coming out in a month
or so.

TW  is  the result of a lot of hard work by two UK scene groups, NFA and
Carnage, but the magazine itself isn't a scene-orientated thing, instead
we  like  to  include  anything  and  everythng, from Poetry and Bizarre
articles to Hardware and Adults-Only pages, it's all in there!



                                                                more -->




If anyone in Spain (or anywhere in Europe!) would like a copy then send
two formatted/checked disks to:

                          The Word - Diskback
                          P.O.Box 42,
                          Grimsby,
                          N.E.Lincolnshire.
                          DN33 1RY
                          ENGLAND

We  will  send  you  the *next* issue, this means that you might have to
wait  a  month  or  so  but it *will* be sent, or you can ask us for the
current  issue  (10) and we'll send you that *straight away*!  You can't
say fairer than that!

     The Word is 100% English - don't get it if you can't speak it!

End
