Hey!   Are  you  a  good  musician?Are you perhaps only a learner?Do you
think  that  you are capable to compose a good mod?,if yes,why you don't
send us your stuff and participe in our music contest?The rules are:
 
   *- You must compose the module in the standard .mod format
   *- You can send your mods in an Amiga,PC or a Mac floppy disk
   *- The mod will not exceed more than 100 Kilobytes in his pure
        state,it means that you can't use a packer to pack the mod
   *- No digitized mods are allowed
   *- Compositions must be original and not versions of other songs
   *- You must send all the instruments copied by separately 
        and indicating what place did you found each one

And  of  course  there  is  a prize for the winner, it's an 8-bits audio
digitizer and a very interesting part is that the mod will appear in the
next  Inforadio  demo  and  the  name of the author/s will appear in the
credits   section   of  the  demo,what  are  you  waiting  for?Let's  go
compose,boy!
