                          THE EDITORIAL PAGE

     NOTE:  This editorial may sound like a bitch session and in a way it
is.  I need to vent it, and I am sure a lot of you will feel better after
you HEAR someone say what you might have been thinking all along...
 
                                  *** 
 
     This month I want to talk about an interesting trait.  It is the basis
of trust;  the cornerstone to good business.  Everyone desires it, yet so
few are willing to give it.  It can destroy countries;  assasinate men.  It
can ruin an economy or pull a third world from out under.  It cannot be
given singlely but only in pairs.  The user's abundance of this trait has
kept the Amiga alive this long and will likely keep her alive into the next
decade. 
 
     But some people aren't displaying this trait.  The antonym of the trait
of which I speak is what they are practicing.  They hide behind financial or
political excuses;  some don't hide at all.  What is this trait I refer to?
 
     Loyalty.

     There certainly seems to be a huge lack of it as of late.  How  many
companies have turned traitor on the Amiga and her followers?  How many of
those companies OWE THEIR EXISTANCE to the Amiga?  Finally, how many CARE?
 
     I have seen treachery folks.  Look at the companies of which I speak;
NewTek, Psygnosis, Electronic Arts, and more. 
 
     Electronic Arts - They were there at the beginning, sure. DPAINT was a
breakthough and is still considered the most popular paint program of all
time.  MARBLE MADNESS, ADVENTURE CONSTRUCTION SET, SWORD OF SODAN, and the
list goes on.  They took their 68000 experience and applied it to the Sega
Genesis and became one of the hottest companies in the console world.  Their
interest dragged over to the PC where they began writing excellent programs
like SEAWOLF.  What about their origins?  What about the 'little engine that
could'?  Cut the roots of a tree and it dies. Too bad it isn't so with
developers.  Oh sure, we get games with the EA label, but they are not EA
games.  BULLFROG and others are the "Amiga Side" of EA and even THEY seemed
to forget how much money they made on POPULOUS for the Amiga. 
 
     Psygnosis - Are you about tired of these guys or what???  What
happended?  (Other than SONY buying them...)  Remember the days when you
bought Psygnosis titles ON SIGHT.  Didn't even need to see the preview.  If
it bore the logo, it was a quality kick butt game.  Sure their copy
protection sucked and didn't load on 25% of the A500's but  hey;  we can
forgive sometimes (hard to forgive $49).  Then all the sudden every crappy
game that came out shined with the logo.  What in the hell was RED ZONE?
PRIME MOVER?  The other dozen crap titles they put out?  Then you see the
games like HEXED come out for the PC and Lemmings 3 out for the PC first.
Guess what, losers?  You owe your entire company to the Amiga.  AMIGA gave
you Lemmings.  AMIGA gave you Shadow of the Beast 1-3.  Now, you discard us
like used toilet paper?  Psygnosis DEVELOPED NovaStorm on/for the Amiga
CD32.  Is it available for CD32?  AGA Amiga?  Nope.  But it has been out for
the PC for months.  "The project is on hold;  it may not be released," a
Psygnosis rep told me.  I don't get it.  The game is DONE, ready for
duplication, why not capitalize on the 75,000+ CD32 owners out there?   Oh
sure, we just got a new game from Psygnosis.  You guys see THIS crap? X-IT.
Oh yeah.  What happened to Operation G2?  Or should I say, when is the PC
version due out??? :( 
 
     New Tek - I used to have more respect for them than any mortal man had
for anything.  I used to show their products, demo their tapes at user
groups, and sing praises of the Toaster (which I enthusiastically bought).
Remember, guys?  Remember the DIGIVIEW?  DIGIPAINT?  The NewTek Demo Reels?
When they were still wiping their 'cherry' noses with Amiga user's money?
When their products were cutting edge and they changed the face of desktop
video forever?  AMIGA's put Lotus Turbo's in their driveway.  Anyone know
what they told PC and MAC when the Toaster came out and Big Blue came to
them and begged and PLEADED for a Toaster for the PC?  "Your machine isn't
powerful enough to handle it;  the architecture is too closely linked to the
custom chip set of the Amiga."  You know what they are saying now??? "Buy a
PC.  It is better than an Amiga and we are going to change our video system
to the PC platform.  Sorry Amiga."  (!)  So, suffice to say, I have sold my
Toaster, erased my copies of the Demo Reels, and sent a nasty-gram to their
corporate office in Topeka.  The funniest thing about it, is that the
company seemed to go to hell after Kiki Stockhammer left...
 
     I know what you 'close to converting to PC' Amiga guys out there are
about to say.  "They are just going where the money is;  they have to make a
living too, you know,"  Alright, fine.  Make a living.  Rob the PC owners;
they are already used to it.  Take them for EVERY DIME (DOLLARS in their
case).  But please;  PLEASE don't bite the hand that fed you in the
beginning.  You never forget your best friends;  don't forget about us now
that you are 'big stars' in the 'movie screen' of life.  We put you in that
multi-million dollar business and $150K cars.  How about remembering to give
something back?  We are grateful for DPaintV that is coming (although
everyone is using Brilliance now anyway;  day late and a dollar short); now

                                 - Page 3 -
3.	The Editorial Page

how about SEAWOLF?  I am SURE you could find some clever Shareware
programmers that would go commercial if you paid them - (shameless
self-promotion) Look at Digital Illusions/21st Century and see how it is
done.  Psygnosis;  take X-IT and 'x-it' it back wherever it came from. Give
us HEXED.  Give us NovaStorm (I could move those like water).  Get DMA
DESIGN *NOT* to drop the Amiga.
 
     Folks, I haven't seen anything on the PC to beat my aged A2000 or CD32
yet.  The productivity software is just as good (albeit in smaller
quantities), the games are better (quality vs. quantity folks).  Don't EVEN
start with that DOOM crap or I'll reach out and slap ya through the monitor
<grin>.  Texture mapping is fun for about 10 mintues (hey, this IS an
editorial; not reflecting the opinions of DUP <Seumas>).  RAPTOR PC from
APOGEE?  Great game - Sure.  I LOVED it the FIRST time I played it back in
1985 when it was called BATTLE SQUADRON on the AMIGA 500. (Doncha love how
the screen stops for a half a second on RAPTOR when you grab a smart bomb?
Even on a 486DX2/66?)  Duh....
 
     For those of you devoted Amiga lovers out there;  hang on.  We are
still getting product and the liquidation procedings can't last forever (it
seems like it has been forever already).  Get a CD32 and play some of the
COOLEST games ever.  Get a CYBERSTORM card and SMOKE the Pentiums out there.
Get an emulator if you can't live without Word Perfect.  Times are bleak,
but we are through the eye of the hurricane and going for the tail.

     For you "convertee's" or those who are considering it; consider again.
I went to the largest PC dealer in my area and walked in the door and asked
him to quote me on a system that would do 30 fps full screen with NO
slowdown or jerkies.  When I looked at the print out, I almost crapped.
$3708.94.  POOF!  That was a loaded up P90, but no sound card or any special
extras.  Then I got told later that even THAT wouldn't have done the job.
Don't forget all the little expenses  that we take for granted. Don't forget
about the LAMIGA-M/N that won't be there any more.  Get REALLY intimate with
the "THIS WILL END YOUR WINDOWS SESSION" requester.  Try this at home, as
you will have a good idea that your decked out PC will be like:
 
 
                     TURNING YOUR AMIGA INTO A PC 
                          (In 10 Easy Steps) 
 
     1. Install a 68040/40 in the Amiga and then run DEGRADER's TIMEWASTE
        function so you can simulate the bottleneck of the PC's CPU. 
     2. Remove all but 512K of memory. (That's all you will ever need,
        right?) 
     3. RELOKICK to V1.2 of AmigaDOS but run MagicWB or MUI on the screen
        to make it look pretty.  Run every WB hack you can find. 
     4. Make a partition on your hard drive that is about 20 megs (that
        makes it comparable to a 240 MB on the PC). 
     5. Make sure you take about $1500 out of your pocket and throw it in
        the trash. (Or the difference between your Amiga and comparable PC,
        whichever is less.) 
     6. Oh, and allocate about $400 every 8-12 months to make sure your
        machine can run the next season's program.
     7. Plug your sound output to a $10 pair of Walkman speakers to
        simulate a PC Sound Card. 
     8. Go to your nearest Amiga dealer and buy some software from him, but
        mark it up about 35% and throw the mark up money in the trash with
        the initial $1500.
     9. Spend about 10-12 manhours fiddling with your CDROM
        controller/sound card to imitate the setup procedure for installing
        a CDROM in a PC.
     10. Print a file, download some freeware, copy some floppies, and
         optimize your hard drive together and REJOICE that you really
         AREN'T using a PC!

                    Dark Unicorn Productions Update 
 
     Previous issues of the DARK UNICORN DISPATCH we mentioned that Better
Concepts, Inc. is now handling the distribution of DUP's software.  Those of
you who have ordered and waited forever for your order, our apologies and
thanks for being patient while we make the transition from individual
shareware to group.  Many of you I contacted personally to let you know of
the dilemma.  (Basically, the mail lost our initial package of stuff and we
waited almost two weeks and ended up sending another shipment.)  BY the time
you read this, everything should be smooth running.  Once again, thank you
for your support.
 
     Releases now available - PSYCHO SQUARES DELUXE, PSD: BAREST ESSENTIALS
ADULT DATA DISK, TOMCAT, ITS THE PITS, and the FUTURE SHOCK 2 CD from DUP
member SIDEWINDER. 
 
     FLYING TIGERS, the killer helicopter arcade simulation, is nearling
completion.  Amazing the things we are arguing over (eh, Seumas?  Ha Ha) but
things are now smoothed out and the game is coming soon.  It will be
available through Better Concepts, Inc. also. 
 
     FLEET COMMANDER is not abandoned;  just delayed.  I got an offer to do
some good CD projects for LOTS of money, so I had to take it to support my
CD32 habit.  Look for my first CD32 game this summer. 
 
     Since Kit Felice is now finished with ITS THE PITS! we are looking to
send him in a new direction.  With myself as the designer and Kit as the
programmer, we might just be bringing you one of the most addictive and gory
game ever to hit the Amiga.  Can't tell you much right now, but it may have
something to do with pigs... 
 
     TOMCAT fans rejoice.  John Graham is hard at work with his next FMV
project for you.  I hesitate to comment, but it will take place in space and
should be even more in depth and fun than Tomcat.  Stay tuned for more next
month. 
 
                           The Industry News 
 
     Not much has been happening in the Amiga industry, really.  There is
some new hardware coming out (a true 64-bit video card for one) and a
handful of developers really supporting the Amiga.  Some developers have
left (hopefully not for good) to other platforms, but the best coders are
still with us.  New offerings from Team 17 are abundant as well as some
other top notch companies (did I hear something about a new game coming from
Bloodhouse?). 
 
     No new word yet from OCEAN on TFX or INFERNO.  How about hooking us up
guys?  Bullfrog has been silent about MAGIC CARPET and CREATION.  We did get
a CD32 version of THEME PARK (totally sucked) from them, but that was about
it.  There is power in the people, folks.  Write to these companies and
others and tell them you want support; that even that Commodore is dead, the
Amiga still lives.  Get your user group members to each write a letter to
them.  Even a form letter with a real signature is good.  Let them know you
have a machine with more than a meg and hopefully they will stop stripping
things out of them (like modem play).  We have the power to support.  Let's
start doing that with both words and our money.

   |his game is Deathsword for the 90s, except it's Cyberpunks liberating
heads from blood-spurting bodies instead of barbarians. The Demo of the game
is on two DMS disks (yuck), but they are small and are standard OFS disks.
You can install it to Hard Drive, but even though the docs state it runs
fine with AGA, accelerator, MMU, FastRom, etc', I had to turn off AGA to get
it to run on my 030 1200.  It also is a bit weird when it comes to PAL/NTSC,
when run in "PAL" on my 1200 with degrader the screen was in PAL but it was
only NTSC height.  On our 500 with a boot disk it ran in full-size PAL a-ok.
Hard Drive install also needs a few assigns, and that's a pain.
  __
 |__|
 |laying the demo is a fair bit of fun, two player mode is a bit limited in
that there's an un-displayed time-limit that resets the game after a little
while, but you can still kill each other a few times.  One-Player lets you
kill about 6 different Cyborgs before it quits, who use a lot of different
weapons.  You can buy different weapons at the shop in the one player mode
also, the ones in the demo are a Sword, a Mace, and an Axe, plus Cyber Arm
Upgrades and a bunch of throwing weapons.  Oh yes, you can throw things, and
when you run out you get to spit at your enemy.  Heh heh.  Throwing weapons
are cool, Stars, Lasers, Knives, Fire and Acid, the latter two leaving piles
of gunk on the ground that hurts players walking over it until it goes away.
There are also random traps and spikes that fall from the ceiling of the
arena now and then.  The fighting moves are fairly varried, ducking and
standing stabs, head and stomach stabs, chops, kicks, and the ever popular
HEAD REMOVAL ROUND ABOUT SUPER SLICE!  The moves can be a bit tough to do
some times though, there are spots when you'll just stand still because it
seems you're pushing the stick too fast to register the move.
  __
 |  |
 |__|ver all, with the two-player and head removals, this game is probly
worth it.  It's not quite as bloated as some Eurogames (see following review
;), and it's fun.  One other downside though is that in the One Player game,
which in the full version supposedly has 32 battles, if you lose your head
once it's back to the start. If you don't mind that TOO much though, or have
someone to two- player with, this is good.  BLOOD!  GORE!  DEATH!  Heh heh.

 |  |ere we have a Mule type game.  I've never actually played Mule, but I'm
told it's similar.  This is supposedly a Demo of an upcoming commercial
game, but from what I've played there isn't anything crippled or chopped
down for it, though of course I haven't seen (or even heard of) the full
game.  It's your usual Euro game, does NOT run from Hard Drive (if anyone
knows how, PLEASE tell me!), has a lot of flashy graphics and sounds all
loaded from disk, and needs PAL, but unlike most it actually uses standard
Amiga Dos disks.

 | __
 |__|ameplay is realtime-strategy, with breaks for news and status reports.
You first select the number of Players, your Name, and Race (alien types),
then the speed of the game and the type of terrain to play on.  At the start
of the game you all pilot little flying-saucer type ships in a demolishion
derby of sorts for premium landing spots on the one-screen sized planet map.
Once you land you set up a base, and then go on to the rest of the game.
Play is broken up into Rounds, with realtime elements for most actions.  At
the start of every round all players simultaniously grab for terrain, you

                                 - Page 6 -
5.	Shareware Update

can each get one new plot of land per turn, plus the odd Land For Sale event
to buy extra. Then it's on to buying and placing Robots on your land, and
gambling for credits and such at the local planet pub.  Once every player
has placed their robots, they will all produce a certian slightly randomized
amount of material (except if a player runs our of Protenoid, then they are
taken to hospital and their robots don't produce that turn).  Now comes the
main auction, and for each product that is on the planet there is one
auction round.  You decide if you are a buyer or a seller, and then all
players move their price pointers up and down the price graph until a buyer
and a seller's price meets, then the seller sells to the buyer.  As well
there is a time limit for the auction, and you can also buy from or sell to
the Shop if no players want to trade to or from you.  After that there's a
Status Screen for who has the most Cash, and it's back to the start for
another round.
     ___
     |__|
 The |__|ad: Floppy play ONLY.  That really stinks.  Luckily there isn't
much disk access during each game.  I'd really expect a strategy game like
this to play on HD and quit back to Workbench, but no such luck. Another
thing is that there are always 4 players, if there aren't enough Humans the
rest will be Computer.  That wouldn't be so bad, but you can't set their
skill level, and so far the computer players ALWAYS beat me silly (I've
played about 5 games now, each game takes a few hours). There are also NO
docs in this "demo", so you have to figure it all out for yourself.  It's
not too hard to work out the basics, but some info on the different robots
would really help.  There's also no way to know the advantages and
disadvantages of the different alien races, and that's a major pain.  And
here's a tip:  In the auctions, once everybody's done what they want and
that oh-so-long timer has a fair way to tick down, just hold the stick up or
down (the same direction as what you are, buyer or seller) and when the
price pointer is all the way up or down hit the button with the stick held.
That will end the auction quickly.
      ___
     | __
 The |__|ood: Trading is kinda fun.  It does seem like there are a lot of
different strategies to use, and the random events add to the fun (but can
also make you extremely annoyed).  The auctions for goods and produce are
done well, there's a fair bit of strategy involved, and the realtime moving
graphs are cool.  The music is also quite good, there are three pieces to
choose from and it playes the whole time you're gameing without getting
annoying.

 \    /
  \/\/hen all is said and done, it looks to be a good planetary trading game
with a few flaws, and a good multi player mode.  Personally I think a game
like this, a strategy game filled with megs of flashy graphics and sounds,
would be best done as a system-legal Hard Drive installable game.  But, you
take what you get, and even through it's Euro-what-is- a-hard-drive exterior
it's worth a look if you don't mind a 1.2 meg download.  It's probably also
possible to actually beat the computer players with some documentation to
figure out all the strategies for different terrains and robots, but a
Difficulty Setting would still be nice.

     Good spread of reviews this month.  There are some great offerings for
you regardless of what kind of gamer you are.  If you are a strategy game
player, you MUST read about Impressions' LORDS OF THE REALMS then go buy it.
It is as detailed as you hungry strategists could hope for. Complicated too.
Arcade fiends will find solace in ALL TERRAIN RACING from TEAM17, the next
best thing to ROADKILL.  Try your hand in a killer bowling game with
KINGPIN.  Finally, let your PC friends have both barrels when you show them

just getting harder and harder to find good ECS games.  Stop fighting AGA;
it is here to stay.  I understand; I fought it too.   It is okay.  Really! 
 
                LORDS OF THE REALM - Impressions U.K. 
 
     Once again, when the world of Amiga looks its bleakest, we get another
hot new game that breathes new life back into the platform.  Impressions
U.K. has completely outdone themselves and their competition with this new
incredible strategy game.  So good, in fact, that rival TEAM 17 dropped
production on THEIR new strategy game KING OF THIEVES (a game of similar
play) because they knew they didn't have a chance of getting the market
share THIS time. 
 
     First, let me tell you why this impressed me so much.  I hate strategy
games like this.  I liked Sim City, but not Civilization or most games
similar to them.  Defender of the Crown 2 was okay, but it wasn't deep.
Lords of the Realm (LOTR) is quite involved, actually, almost to the point
of scaring you away at first.  I mean, c'mon;  CROP ROTATION?  YUK!  The
game did, however, grab me instantly and drag me in, making me want to play
it great lengths of time.
 
     At first glance, you may mistake it for a Defender of the Crown clone.
The game is played on a map of England with each county clearly divided. The
map is a very clean graphic relief map and actually play is done on a
scrolling enlarged version of the map (kinda like Sim City with good
graphics).  The play is near real time but play is done in turns all the
same.  Up to six human or computer opponents to can play.
 
     The likeness to Defender of the Crown ends there.  You must take charge
of your county and manage all the resources of it.  The first concern is
keeping the people happy;  i.e. FED.  To keep them from going hungry, you
must learn all about farming.  Your primary concerns;  the fields, sheep,
cows, and grain.  Each commodity requires a certain number of men to
maintain/enrich it.  If you don't have enough men for each, you will lose
fields, sheep, and importantly cows.  You are told how many men you need,
but often  times you have too few men to get things going.  Each item is
important in its own way.  Sheep give wool which can later be sold to
traders for crowns (money).  Grain is an expendable food source that won't
last very long, so you either make a LOT of it or rely on the cows to
provide dairy products to feed your people.  Should you have too many people
and not enough grain or dairy products, your people will eat the livestock
next.  The best method is to get enough cows to feed everyone with dairy.
That way, when you take over other counties that are underprivileged you
have a ready source of food you can ship them without taxing the people in
your 'home' county.
 
     Once you have the men in fields distributed right (this changes every
turn, so you will have the opportunity to learn the dynamics of
distribution.  In addition to the farmer stuff, you have to also allocate
men for mining, foresting, etc. to gain THOSE valuable resources to make
weapons and castles.  If you constantly take off and put on people in the
mines, forest, etc. their efficiency level will go down since each group
must be trained over time.  A small handful of 100% trained people will
generate more  resources than a lot of people trained at 18%.  Oh, you will
eventually have to take men out and put them in your military too. 
 
     The final consideration in the farming community is that of crop
rotations.  Cows and sheep eat down fields and new grain crop must be sown
and grown after each harvest.  You must rotate commodities through all your
lands.  This is not an optional part of the game.  You will fail if you do
not learn how to properly rotate crops.
 
     Once you got the farming steady and comfortable, expect the worst.
Plague, rats, bad weather, and much much more will constantly mess with your
delicate balance.  Farming is a never ending battle.
 
     Mastering farming gets a lot easier after awhile.  Your people's

happiness factor will fluctuate but you can keep them happy by increasing
their rations or buying them ale, or just random events like a royal wedding
will perk them up.  The more happiness, the more immigrations will happen
and that is what you want.
 
     The traders will come by every so often and buy/sell cows, sheep,
grain, natural resources, weapons, and more.  This is how you make money;
selling wool and natural resources you don't need.  Naturally when you need
them the most, none will appear, or they don't carry what you need.  The
biggest mistake is to run out of food, thinking that you can go right ahead
and buy some soon. 
 
     How about castles?  Sure, you can build castles with TONS of resources
and men.  The game comes with lots of pre-made castles as well as a 'castle
construction set' (complete with a castle building manual) to make your own.
Castles are not overly important;  not when you can just take someone else's
with some force.
 
     For militia, well, now it becomes another type of game.  To gain
troops, you must either hire mercenaries (when they apply for work) or
conscript men from the population.  You can have unarmed armies, but that is
pretty stupid.  You really should have a good cache of weapons before you
conscript your men.  Armies are cool, though, because they don't eat from
your own stores, but the stores of the county they are in or the forest. You
move them so many places per turn and combat can either be interactive or
non-interactive.  Combat takes place with an overhead view in real time. Set
who you want to attack and how and let them go to town. The real time
battles can be fascinating to watch.  Easy to control, yet still gives you
low level power of the troops.  Like the people, if the troops aren't happy,
they can revolt against you.  A real bummer.  I don't recommend that. 
 
     The other 5 players are also trying to take over the other counties
(yours included eventually).  Some will be taken without a fight; others
will resist you.  You may send letters to the other lords, and even make
alliances (they never hold up). 
 
     The game is AGA only and actually looks very clean.  It is identical to
the IBM PC version without modem play (of course).  The music is annoying
(but you CAN turn it off) and the sound effects are great.  The game is
mouse controlled and the interface is quick and easy; you'll be comfortable
with it in no time.  Animation is minimal but in spots breathtaking.  It is
fully hard drive installable and breaks clean back to AmigaDOS; a nice
little additive in today's world.
 
     This is one highly recommended game;  even if you hate strategy
simulations.  If you spend your cash on nothing else this month, get this
game and write to Impressions and tell them you want modem play added. Don't
bother to call the U.S. office;  they know absolutely NOTHING about the
Amiga version.  But, let the U.K. guys know you want it.  If enough people
knock on the door, someone is bound to answer it.
 
           ALIEN BREED 3D/KINGPIN/ALL TERRAIN RACING (Previews) 
 
     Team 17 is going to be the hottest Amiga game company in the world this
year.  Aside from bringing us some of the best games ever on the Amiga/CD32
(Super Stardust, Tower Assault, Arcade Pool, Super Frog, Project X, and
numerous others) they are bringing us the hottest new games for the coming
year.  As you read this, these game demos are now available up on TOMBSTONE
BBS (other good BBSs too) for your OWN review.  However, I will fill you in
on any other little goodies I know about.
 
     ALIEN BREED 3D (Easter) - This is the game that Amiga game owners have
been waiting on for a long time; a real competitor to the IBM PC game DOOM.
Sure, there have been lots of flashy demos and 'walk arounds' cloning the
texture mapped graphics engine that has been hailed as a breakthrough in
'virtual reality' gaming.  (Obviously none of these fools have a CLUE what
real VR is, but hey;  they don't know what a real computer or OS is either,

                                 - Page 9 -

so you can understand their confusion.)  But this is promised to be the
first REAL GAME that uses the engine.  A Shareware game called FEARS has
been released and it is decent, but not really comparable to DOOM.
 
     AB3D brings you the full texture mapped world complete with numerous
monsters, doors, elevators, see through walls, floors and ceilings, stairs,
opening doors, 'bounce-while-you-walk', throw switches, outdoor areas,
texture mapped REFLECTING water, and much much more.  Add all this to the
fact that it runs VERY WELL at 14mhz and I think you have a real winner. The
game is, of course,  AGA only and a CD32 version is planned (that would
RULE).  The non-playable 'rolling' demo is out but won't yet run on the 4000
(it will though, I am told).  This Easter Team 17 will make a LOT of gamers
happy! 
 
     KINGPIN BOWLING (SOON!) - Yet another crisp game of bowling.  I know, I
know.  STRIKES AND SPARES was enough for most people (and it was pretty
good) but KINGPIN promises to take it the medium a step farther.
 
     The game is a straight game of bowling;  no little creatures run across
the alley and smack your ball or anything.  But, the controls are a bit
different. 
 
     The initial camera shot is 'behind the shoulder' as you set your
placement on the floor.  Then you set your strength with a little animated
bowler on the right hand side of the screen.  When you press your button, an
arrow will appear down the alley a bit.  If you threw with a LOT of power,
the arrow will bounce back and forth fast, or it will be slower based on the
power.  Once you throw it, the ball rolls about halfway down then the camera
angle changes to about half way down the alley looking at the pins
dramatically enlarged.  The ball hits and the pin action is fantastic.  You
get robbed all the time, just like in REAL bowling. 
 
     The demo doesn't let you pick players or anything, just a straight
forward demo game.  Lots of features are promised including a nice
soundtrack, better/more sound effects, some good cut animation (can't wait
to see the CD intro), and more.  Graphics are better than Strikes and Spares
and have the definite Team 17 polish to them.  Once again, this game should
be a winner,  especially on the CD32 platform.  It is due out anytime. 
 
     ALL TERRAIN RACING (SOON!) - Take last year's hottest game ROADKILL and
throw in a little of Psygnosis' NITRO, and add the graphic designer of BODY
BLOWS and you get ATR.  This is yet another overhead view racing game with
some choice features indeed. 
 
     Unlike ROADKILL, your object it to beat the other cars fair and square,
not destroy them.  The speed is fast and furious though, and there are
plenty of goodies to pick up along the way;  cash, nitro boosts, etc. With
the cash you can buy car enhancements like NITRO such as acceleration, top
speed, etc. 
 
     The graphics of the cars are unbelievably smooth.  Each car has to have
about 60-100 frames of animation each, I swear.  They respond well and do
all the things cars SHOULD do when meeting the conditions that these cars
do.  When going over a log bridge, the car vibrates like it should. Little
things like that litter the game.
 
     There are several terrains to choose from (only one in the demo) as
well as many cars to choose from (again, only one in the preview).  You
start off with a LITTLE bit of cash to start with and they let you spend it
before your race. 
 
     For those of you without the games I mentioned earlier, the view is top
down and the actual track is about 3x3 screens large and scroll with you as
you race.  Like NITRO, when two players are playing, if a player gets a
whole screen ahead of the other human, the other human's car will be 'yanked
up' to join the first one,  with penalty to be sure.  Quite the quality
game.  I can't wait for the real thing.  Hopefully a CD32 version will come

   |onight we look at a new DOOM-ish engine with two pending new games using
it, and a peek at a full DOOM-ish game on it's way.
  ___
 |___
 |irst there is TextDemo 5.7, this has been around in various forms for
quite some time now, and has been regularly updated.  I really like this
engine, it has variable screen sizes (NTSC sizes on the way), it now has
Floors and soon Ceilings, it has DOOM-like bouncing while you run, Mouse and
Joystick control, and it takes full advantage (and needs for best
performance) a fast Amiga with AGA.  It also stores it's textures as 24- Bit
IFFs, and converts them to ECS or AGA for play, and this leaves the door
open for 24-Bit Graphics Card support in the future for just BRILLIANT
on-screen graphics.  This highly contrasts Alien Breed 3D, which has a
smallish display that won't go full screen, is AGA only, runs the very same
speed on an unexpanded stock 1200 as on a fast 1200, and won't even RUN on a
4000 or 030 1200 (at least in the Demo version).

 |\ |
 | \|ow I'm not totally against Alien Breed 3D, I'll probly buy it if the
finished product works on a 1200 030 or a 4000, as it does look fairly
atmospheric and I want all the decent Ami DOOM clones I can get.  :)
However, I'm looking forward much more to the two games in development with
the TextDemo Engine, as they will scream in full-screen on my super powered
50mhz 030 1200.  If you don't have TD5.7, the two games in the works (that
will take a while to come out, I am told) are a DOOM like game with Magic
and Monsters (probly a lot like Heretic on the IBM, it uses the DOOM engine
for a spellcasting battle, I'm about to go try that out in a few minutes),
and another game where you drive a Tank through the 3D world that will have
a split-screen two player mode (Yay!).
  ___
 |___
 |___ven with these new and promising 3D developments, I still have a soft
spot for POOM 0.2.  I haven't seen it upgraded in a few months, but it
really blew me away when I dug into it.  Floors and Ceilings, plus a decent
frame rate with a near full-screen display.  If they can get variable floor
and wall heights worked into POOM, it'll be great, but even if not I'd love
to see a game with it's engine as well.  Wandering through it has given me
the most feeling of fear and danger in a no- monsters demo on the Amiga
yet.

to KILL KILL KILL on my Ami instead of just on our I Be Mud.  ;)

9.	AMOS Programming

                  Programming in AMOS - PART 2 

                                - Page 13 -
9.	AMOS Programming

 
     Last month we looked at how to handle variable and a few of the basics
of programming. This month, we are going to look at some more basics and
begin to apply it to an actual program. 
 
     Aside from variables, the next most used area is that of LOOPs. Almost
every program uses loops;  some more than others.  There are many types of
loops and we are going to look at them all, since different loops work
better for different things.  Let's do some demonstrations.  Let's write a
program that will count to 10. 
 
     PRINT "1":PRINT "2":PRINT "3":PRINT "4":PRINT "5":PRINT "6" 
     PRINT "7":PRINT "8":PRINT "9":PRINT "10" 

  The above routine does the job of counting to ten.  Try this: 
 
     T=1 
     DO 
     PRINT T:T=T+1:IF T = 11 THEN END 
     LOOP 

  This is called a DO...LOOP or "DO LOOP" routine.  It is continuous unless
you terminate the program with an END or leave the loop with an EXIT
command.  This is handy for routines like main menus where you are
constantly waiting for a user input.  Like this: 
 
     PRINT "PRESS LEFT MOUSE BUTTON TO CONTINUE OR RIGHT TO QUIT" 
     DO 
     IF MOUSE CLICK=1 THEN EXIT 
     IF MOUSE CLICK=2 THEN END 
     LOOP 

  The DO...LOOP is not the best choice for the routine we want to do;
however, there are still some other loop methods we can use... 
 
     REPEAT 
     T=T+1 
     PRINT T 
     UNTIL T=10 

  This is the REPEAT ... UNTIL or "REPEAT UNTIL" loop.  Very similar to DO
... LOOP except that it has the 'value check' at the end.  This, too, is
very handy for user inputs, but not really what we want to accomplish here.
Here is another looping example: 
 
     START: 
     T=T+1 
     PRINT T 
     IF T=10 THEN END 
     GOTO START 

  This is called the GOTO LOOP.  Probably the lamest way to do business in
this sense.  However, the GOTO LOOP is an INVALUABLE tool and can be
utilized.  Finally, let's look at the routine *I* would use for the
problem.
 
     FOR T = 1 TO 10 
     PRINT T 
     NEXT T 

  This is the classic FOR...NEXT LOOP.  You will find yourself using this
routine the most of all.  It is the most versatile.  You can do it forwards,
backwards, in steps, read the variable directly and much more. Here are some
advanced uses of the FOR...NEXT loop. 
 
     FOR T = 1 TO 12 STEP 2:PRINT T:NEXT 
     FOR T = 63 TO 0 STEP -1:VOLUME T:NEXT 

                                - Page 14 -
9.	AMOS Programming


  Notice in the above examples we don't use NEXT T, just NEXT.  If you are
using only ONE loop, you can do that.  If you are using what is called
NESTED loops (loops within loops), you will HAVE to specify the variable in
the FOR part of the statement.  Therefore: 
 
     FOR T = 1 TO 10          <-------------+ 
     FOR Y = 10 TO 20         <-+           | 
     PRINT T*Y                  | Loop #2   | Loop #1 
     NEXT Y                   <-+           | 
     NEXT T                   <-------------+ 

  Type the above code in and see the results.  Feel free to play with the
values and see what happens.  You learn by playing.  Heck, I taught myself
programming by fixing the bugs that were in magazine type in programs back
in the 80's.  This loop is a good way of doing things (like pasting things
on the screen in increments, etc) without having to spell everything out.
 
     Let's talk about one more basic function before we hit some heavy AMOS
specific commands and get started on some code.  The function is BRANCHING.
This is a descision making and action function.  As will almost any
programming function, it can be done in numerous different ways.  The most
common one we have already seen;  the IF...THEN statement.
 
     PRINT "PRESS LEFT BUTTON TO CONTINUE OR RIGHT TO END" 
     DO 
     IF MOUSE CLICK=1 THEN EXIT 
     IF MOUSE CLICK=2 THEN END 
     LOOP 

  IF ... THEN tests a condition.  If the condition is met, it carries out
the next command.  If not, the statement is ignored.  You don't have to do
'true' tests;  it works for a variety of formats and variable types.  Like
these commands: 
 
     IF T<7 THEN PRINT "T IS LESS THAN 7" 
 
     IF T<>10 THEN PRINT "T IS NOT EQUAL TO 10" 
 
     IF T=>1 THEN PRINT "T IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO ONE" 
 
     IF PASSWORD$="DARK UNICORN" THEN PRINT "PASSWORD ACCEPTED" 
 
     IF T*10=100 THEN PRINT "YOU GET AN EXTRA LIFE" 

  As you can see, this is the most versatile command ever.  There is more
you can do with it, too.  You can combine 'condition checks' as well as
branch off if the expression is NOT correct; using the ELSE command. Hence:

 
     IF T=1 AND MOUSE CLICK THEN GOTO SUBROUTINE 
     IF T=0 THEN PRINT "YOU ARE DEAD":ELSE PRINT "YOU LIVE AGAIN" 

  Learn this command and you will find that you can apply it in dozens of
ways.  The other BRANCHING command I want to address is the ON ...
GOTO/GOSUB conditional.  This is cool for menu options.  Let's say your main
menu has 5 different options for the user to pick.  Here is what the tail
end of the routine might look like... 
 
     DO 
     INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR SELECTION? (1-5)";ITEM 
     IF ITEM = 1 THEN GOTO ROUTINE1 
     IF ITEM = 2 THEN GOTO ROUTINE2 
     IF ITEM = 3 THEN GOTO ROUTINE3 
     IF ITEM = 4 THEN GOTO ROUTINE4 
     IF ITEM = 5 THEN GOTO ROUTINE5 
     IF ITEM <1 OR ITEM >5 THEN PRINT "INVALID SELECTION" 

                                - Page 15 -
9.	AMOS Programming

     LOOP 

  Now, let's look at the easy way ... 
 
     DO 
     INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR SELECTION? (1-5)";ITEM 
     ON ITEM GOTO ROUTINE1, ROUTINE2, ROUTINE3, ROUTINE4, ROUTINE5 
     IF ITEM <1 OR ITEM >5 THEN PRINT "INVALID SELECTION" 
     LOOP 

  In this example, you could also substitute GOSUB for GOTO if desired. The
biggest problem with this is that if the user inputs a number for ITEM that
is more than five (or less than 1 for that matter) the ON ... GOTO command
will crash.  You MUST do the 'idiot check' BEFORE the routine if you want
protection.  Like so: 
 
     DO 
     START: 
     INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR SELECTION? (1-5)";ITEM 
     IF ITEM <1 OR ITEM >5 THEN PRINT "INVALID ITEM":GOTO START 
     ON ITEM GOTO ROUTINE1, ROUTINE2, ROUTINE3, ROUTINE4, ROUTINE5 
     LOOP 

  Now there is no way for the ITEM variable to be <1 or >5.  Neat, eh?
 
     Okay, we are done with BRANCHING and LOOPING, so let's start looking at
getting a program started. 
 
     STEP 1 - SETTING UP THE SCREEN 
 
     When AMOS first starts up, it opens a low resolution 'default' screen
to assure you have someplace to send your text, etc. if you forget to set up
your OWN screen.  This is really crappy, so we want to start things off by
opening up our own screen.  As usual, there are a few ways to do this
function.  You may manually open a screen to write to, or create a screen in
a paint program, import it, and use IT as your screen.  There are advantages
to both, so let's look at them.

  SCREEN OPEN number, x size, y size, colors, res +interlace 

  number=Physical screen number 0-15.  Use 0 if you only plan to
       use one screen. 
  x size=Horizontal size in pixels (320, 640, etc) 
  y size=Vertical size in pixels (200, 400, etc) 
  colors=number of colors (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 4096).  Remember, 
       there are limitations on what resolutions can use certain 
       numbers of colors.  Consult your Amiga manual for more 
       information on that.  Your Workbench, for example, is 
       probably 640x200 with 4 colors. 
  res=HIRES or LOWRES display 
  interlace=+LACED for interlaced or blank for non-interlaced. 

  Here are some examples of the command: 
 
     SCREEN OPEN 0,320,400,4096,LOWRES+LACED 
     SCREEN OPEN 1,640,200,16,HIRES 
     SCREEN OPEN 2,100,100,32,LOWRES 

  Notice that you are not locked into a 'standard' screen resolution.  You
can custom make them. 
 
     Importing a screen is SO much easier and I use it all the time.  With
AMOS, you can make a screen in your favorite paint program (DPaint and
Briliance come to mind) and bring it into AMOS.  Here is how.  Go to your
paint program and make a screen that is 320x200 with 32 colors.  Or, grab a
lowres IFF from your collection.  Then, go to AMOS and go to DIRECT MODE
(pressing ESC or clicking the <D on the top left corner of the editor.  At

                                - Page 16 -
9.	AMOS Programming

the prompt, enter this command:
 
     LOAD IFF '<PATH>:<FILENAME>',0 

  This command will load your IFF into screen area 0.  (There is a picture
already made for you included with this archive called SAMPLE.IFF.  Please
use this one for the purposes of this tutorial.)  This will eliminate
anything that was on the screen before.  You should now see your picture
behind the Direct Mode window.  Now type in this command.
 
     PACK 0 TO 6 

  This command will take your picture and pack it into a memory bank. Since
1-5 banks are reserved, you must start with 6.  After a few moments, you
will get your prompt back.  Now, let's test the theory.  Still in Direct
Mode, type DEFAULT.  That will bring the default screen back up; erasing
your picture.  Now type in this: 
 
     UNPACK 6 TO 0 

  POOF!  Your screen will reappear.  The best part is that when you save
your code next, this Bank 6 will save with it.  It is always there unless
you ERASE it.  A very powerful system.  Make your main menu with Dpaint,
bring it in, and whenever you want to display it, just unpack it.  The
beauty of it is, is that the screen parameters will AUTOMATICALLY adjust to
your picture's size, palette, etc.  Fantastic.  Just insert the UNPACK
command at the location you wish the screen to appear.
 
     Now that we have a screen with five buttons to click on, we need to
explore the world of detection.  In the beginning, we are going to learn
about MOUSE ZONEs, the easiest way to make 'hot spots' on the screen to
detect.  MOUSE ZONEs are easy and they are your first step to writing a
great program! 
 
     MOUSE ZONEs are invisible boxes on the screen that you can detect
whether or not the mouse pointer is in them.  The obvious limitation to this
is that they HAVE to be boxes;  not odd shapes.   However, it is incredibly
easy to get into as you will see. 
 
     Before you can set up your zones, you need to allocate a little memory
for the zones.  This is done with the RESERVE ZONE command.
 
     RESERVE ZONE 5 

  This will reserve memory for 5 hot spots to detect.  Now you must define
the areas to detect using the SET ZONE command: 

  SET ZONE number,top left x, top left y TO bottom right x, bottom y 

  number=Zone number 
  Top Left> +------------+ 
  X,Y       |            | 
            |            | 
            |            | 
            |            | 
            |            |  Bottom Right 
            +------------+ <     X, Y 
 
 
     For example, if you wanted to make a MOUSE ZONE at the top left corner
of the screen that was 100x100, here is what the command might look like.
 
     SET ZONE 1,0,0 to 100,100 
 
     Remember, if you have to create multiple zones in a pattern, consider
using a LOOP that you learned about.  The following routine will make a row
a 32x10 pixel MOUSE ZONEs along the top of the screen, numbering them 1

                                - Page 17 -
9.	AMOS Programming

through 10: 
 
     FOR T = 1 TO 10 
     SET ZONE T,T,0 TO T*32,10 
     NEXT T 
 
     As you may have guessed, having even a small number of MOUSE ZONEs to
define can be quite a chore, since you have to know their X and Y locations.
However, after doing it 'by hand' for so long,  I developed a program that
will make creating MOUSE ZONEs incredibly easy.  ZONE FINDER.AMOS is
included with this newsletter.  Just load it into AMOS and it will prompt
you for the rest.  Here is what it does.  It will ask you how many zones on
the picture you wish to define.  Then it will prompt you via the file
requester for the picture you wish to define zones on.  When the picture
comes up, move the pointer to the first zone's TOP LEFT CORNER and click
once.  The pointer will change.  Now click the zone's BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER.
Repeat this for each zone.  When you are all done, the program will prompt
you for a filename to save the zone information to. Save it with a .ASC
extention.  Now, reload your program.  What ZONE FINDER did was calculate
all the numbers FOR YOU, so you don't have to.  It saved an ASCII file with
DATA statements that contain the numbers.  It is just a matter then of
getting the numbers into the SET ZONE command.
 
     By now you should have a simple program with a UNPACK 6 TO 0, where
Bank 6 has a picture with 5 options on it you wish to detect.  If you do
not, there is a simple menu picture included with this archive you can use
with 5 menu options.  Now let's retrieve that zone information ZONE FINDER
provided us with.  Insure the cursor in the editor window is at the location
you wish to insert the data.  Select MERGE ASCII from the pull down menu.
Select your saved zone file with the .ASC extension.  POOF! You will now
have a list of DATA statements that look something like this:

 
     DATA 100,100,200,200 
     DATA 100,100,200,200 
     DATA 100,100,200,200  (The numbers will be different) 
     DATA 100,100,200,200 
     DATA 100,100,200,200 
 
     Now, let's convert that data into hard working MOUSE ZONEs.  We will
use our trust FOR NEXT loop and a new command called READ.  Those of you
familiar with any BASIC knows that READ will grab a value from your bank of
DATA statements in the order they are.  Let's look at the example before we
lose someone. 
 
     FOR T = 1 to 5 
     READ X1,Y1,X2,Y2 
     SET ZONE T,X1,Y1 TO X2,Y2 
     NEXT 
 
     That's it!  You now have five detectable zones!  The READ statment
grabs four values at a time; X1,Y1,X2, and Y2.  These are the TOP LEFT X and
Y coordinates and the BOTTOM RIGHT X and Y coordinates.  We simply READ them
into variables and attach the variables to the SET ZONE command, using the
ever incrementing T variable for the zone nunmber.  Pretty easy, huh?
 
     The last part of the tutorial will teach you how to actually detect
these zones and then do something when you do.  The last command is MOUSE
ZONE.  That holds the current zone that the mouse pointer in on.

     X=MOUSE ZONE
 
     Very simple.  Now the variable X holds the current MOUSE ZONE that the
pointer is under.  Let's add the command to our program using our nifty
DO...LOOP. 
 
     DO 

                                - Page 18 -
9.	AMOS Programming

     MZ=MOUSE ZONE:LOCATE 0,0 
     IF MZ>0 THEN PRINT MZ:ELSE PRINT NZ 
     IF MOUSE CLICK AND MZ>0 THEN EXIT 
     LOOP 
 
     This example will locate the text cursor to the top left corner of the
screen and prints the number of the zone the mouse pointer is currently in
(the value of MZ).  If there is no value for MZ, then it will print the
value of NZ (since we never declared it, it is automatically set to 0).  If
you click either button in one of the zones, the program will EXIT and thus
END. 
 
     So, you now have your FIRST working program in AMOS.  Looks pretty
good, huh?  Oh, but we are just scratching the surface.  We have SOOOOO much
more we can do;  and we will in future editions of Dark Unicorn Dispatch.
Our next goal will be to get the program we just wrote to actually DO
something for real.  Can you guess what that might be??? <grin> Keep reading
and thanks for all your nice comments about the column!

11.	THE LATEST C= NEWS

              THE LATEST NEWS ON THE COMMODORE LIQUIDATION

        This is a new column for The Dark Unicorn Dispatch, but I believe it
is necessary to provide the Amiga community the most factual information
available during this time of need.  I will attempt to give you the most
reliable news possible in the most positive way I can (no ROOMERS columns in
MY magazine) without the editorial comment.  I will always divulge my
sources whenever possible.

                                - Page 19 -
11.	THE LATEST C= NEWS


        ... The longest running Amiga magazine, AMIGA WORLD has been
cancelled by IDG Publications, the magzine's publisher.  This late breaking
news was given to me on March 1st.  No reason was given to me, but it was
said that some of the staff was laid off and that April will be the last
issue.  It was also said that it was very much possible that if the
liquidation is completed, that a similar periodical would be likely to
surface.  Subscribers will have to hang on and see what IDG offers for those
(like myself) who just renewed or started a subscription.  Remaining U.S.
based magazines are Amazing Computing and the not-so-regular Amiga Game
Zone.

        ... The Sam Report from Miami gives us some heartening news.  Sam
lives almost next door to the favored bidder for the Amiga technology,
Creative Equipment International (CEI) and received this news just a week
ago...
                
        o The two recent entrants to the great liquidation proceeedings
          one German and one Seattle based company are no longer in the
          race.  The German company seemed to be interested in obtaining
          the "COMMODORE" name (why on earth would you want it? -Ed) and
          the Seattle-based company was interested in the musical appli-
          cation of the Amiga and decided to get what they needed from
          CEI should they take over the Amiga line.

        o According to CEI, Commodore UK is no longer in the bidding

        o According to CEI, the Mehndi/Gould application for freezing
          the proceedings was denied by New York courts

        o CEI says they have manufacturing plants standing by to begin
          mass production of A1200 and A4000T

        o CEI claims a resolution of the liquidation by the end of March
          and are confident that they (being the only ones left) will
          be accepted

        ... In response to the overwhelming lack of Amiga support (and the
death of Amiga World magazine, Dark Unicorn Productions and Better Concepts
Inc. are looking to start a *NEW* Amiga information publication.  It will be
a diskette based multimedia magazine complete with great new PD and
Shareware along with exclusive articles, interviews, and the things that
Amiga users WANT to read.  Look for more information about this new pub-
lication in the April issue of Amiga World and/or future Amazing Computing
issues.
