                 "Your link to news and information"

Welcome back. This month has been a very confusing one for me. In issue 8
we had a article on the pricing on the A1200. I re-read issue 8 and
thought to myself, the prices seems quite high. Don't get me wrong a
A1200 is very hard to come by right now, but 500.00 for a machine
with no hard drive (which is totally unwanted by the average user, even
a user who will not use lots of space should seriously consider getting
an HD with it) is kind of expensive. A more reasonable price would have
been $600.00 for an A1200 with an hard drive. Other platforms at selling
decent machines fully loaded for 1000.00, in my opinion the A1200 will 
have great success for people who want one, but an current Ibm user
will not pay $750.00 for a machine with two megs of ram, an 170 meg hard 
drive. The A4000T is also quite expensive but I can understand that,
its aimed at being a true video production machine. The DraCo computer,
 a amiga-imposter is also on the way, the DraCo has four megs of 
chip memory instead of the two on the A1200/A4000T, it does lack AGA
chipset but has an Retina card(opitional). It also lacks an OS, which
is sad, the machine has great potential and could probably give the 
A4000T a kick in the pants! :) 

Also some good news, we have a new games editor. He will be writing 
reviews and tips...He is very experienced in the area. We are also 
planning to start a game Q & A section, in which you send the questions
and we send the answers. Just like those expensive gaming magazine you
buy at the newstand, except this is free.

P.S. We are currently trying to make the magazine better, and would like
to make a bit fatter! Why not become a writer for us? 

P.S.S. AmigaLink magazine is now at the famous Amiga Web page, just go to
the magazine section and boom!

@NODE 2.3. "PowerPC announced at VTU expo"
Amiga Technologies Announces RISC Processor Decision


From: Harv@cup.portal.com (Harv R Laser)
Newsgroups: comp.sys.amiga.misc
Subject: Power Amiga (PPC) announced at VTU Expo
Date: 2 Nov 1995 18:00:13 -0800
Organization: The Portal System (TM)

I spent the day today at the Universal City Hilton hotel for the
|2nd annual Video Toaster User expo, which continues thru 04 Nov. 95

Here's a tiny recap - I'll have more to post later along with
photos after I get the film developed and scan them.

In a half-hour speech to a packed ballroom of about 500 people,
Petro Tyschtschenko (say "ta-SHEN-ko"), a very gung-ho and
good English-speaking guy, pulled up a black cloth and revealed
a brand new production Amiga 4000 Tower, and also showed, cased
in lucite, no less, an actual A1200 motherboard produced by
AmigaTech along with a German sales packed-A1200 full of bundled
software.

Tyschtschenko is the President of Amiga Technolgies, GmbH, the
wholly owned subsidiary of Escom, AG, and it's the new 40 person
(so far) company formed to make Amiga personal computers. (Does
anyone not know this yet? :) after Escom bought out Commodore.

He then, with much suspense, announced the next generation Amigas
will use Motorola's PowerPC CPU and will be dubbed the Power Amiga.

Petro, along with his young Press Relations Guy, Gilles Bourdin,
explained that Escom has already spent many times its initial
$12 million investment in the intellectual properties of Commodore,
whom they bought out earlier this year. That They know what the
Amiga is, unlike Commodore's former top management, and that
"We didn't just buy the Amiga for Christmas." He insisted that
the Amiga is back and that development will carry on through the
last of the 68xxx processors, the 68060, and then onto the
PowerPC. He did not name any ship dates for Power Amigas of course,
although scuttlebut says expect them in early '97.

Petro further said that so far, 15,000 new AT-made A1200s have been sold
in Europe. Not just shipped, sold. To customers. And that
over 80,000 more are backordered at dealers and are being
made as fast as the factory can crank them out.

Amiga Tech GmbH is forming a strategic alliance with Apple Computer,
since they have already been before where Amiga is going, from the 68k
family of CPUs to the PPC.

After Petro spoke, Tim Jenison, Pres. of  took the stage
and gave a very moving, tearful speech in tribute to Jay Miner,
father of the Amiga.  This was a speech unlike anything I have
ever heard Jenison give before.  He was on the verge of tears many
times as he recounted his early meetings in Los Gatos with
Jay and the early Amiga engineering crew, showing them the first
Digiview pictures, how Jay was constantly amazed and thrilled at
the things developers were making his little creation do.

I took pictures at the press conference and also in the exhibits
hall of various people and products and will scan and upload them
in the next couple days, putting them on Portal in the Amiga Zone
library and on , so look for them soon.

That's enough for now. I'm pooped.

A new games editor! Welcome Aaron!

                *The Coming of Age: The Only IBM, AMIGA Test*

  I remember when I got my first Amiga, my old trusty Amiga, and it opened my
eyes up to the greatest game-playing machine I had ever seen at the time. I
remember the first games, Artic Fox and Mindwalker where two of the first. And
then 3 years later we got the newest breakthrough, the 2000. 
These were good times when an IBM didnt hold a candle to the Amiga 
and some of the games then like Blood Money.

"The operating system of the Amiga is more advanced than anything the IBM 
could ever dream up."


"Windows was dosshell for the IBM"
while the Amiga O/S was five years ahead of IBM. Then there was the 3000 and
the 4000 which gave the Amiga users something to brag about. But these past
two years IBM is doing the Homework and chatching up fast. I recently
purchased an IBM, the reason was twofold. Most Businesses used the IBM so I
had to learn how to run one if I was going to get a career in PC repair. I
could argue for days about the Pro's / Cons of the systems, but i have found
the perfect way to tell if your a IBM or an AMIGA user. if you like to have
a hard time installing things or setting up your sound card or if you like
having to type of ram go with an IBM. If you want ease of use go with an Amiga.
There is only one downfall with Choosing an Amiga, lack of support and a slow
release of software for the Amiga system. But the Amiga market is rising and
the Amiga support is growing rapidly. There is only one way to get more support
for our system write to the Owners of the big software houses tell them what
you want. It has always been said that if we could unite as one then we could
stand the Amiga back up on its high chair.

LucasArts seems to be back into the Amiga, They have released a demo
of their upcoming game called "The Dig" which is suppose to be based 
on space. Anyway the demo was 2.3 megs long, hopefully the game will
get high ratings such as Monkey Island.

Approach Trainer is a new airplane simulator, Althrough it doesn't
come close to Flight Sim. 5 on an Ibm, it was a supplement to 
A320 airbus. 
 
Turbo Trax is a racing game similar to All-terrain-racing, overhead 
view same graphics. The game is pretty hard through.

Where is AmigaLink going? 
 
Well in two months we should have a much better layout, and style. A new
guide editor will be used. AmigaLink should also get fatter due to its
high distribution circulation. 

Where has it been?
 
This is the tenth issue of AmigaLink magazine, lots has happen since the
first. :) Such as better layouts, a logo, links, and more. So AmigaLink
has improved alot since first issue's. 
 
Why was AmigaLink created?
 
AmigaLink was created to give the Amiga user a feeling of hope and 
information to there finger tips. AmigaLink is not in competing to be
#1, but I guess if we make the magazine really good in two months,
who knows? <grin> AmigaLink is aimed at being an-all magazine which means
it has all types of amiga information, not only one subject. 
 
How are we doing?
 
We love to hear your comments about the magazine, if you do not like 
something or love something please tell us so we can improve it! Just
e-mail @{"John Vlachos" Link 8.1.}.

@NODE 2.9. "More PowerPC news!"
        More PowerPC news!

Retrived from UseNet. From PowerPC magazine.


 
 PowerPC Amiga due 1997
 
 The world should see the first PowerPC-based Amiga by the beginning of 1997,
 according to Petro Tyschtschenko, President of Amiga Technologies.
 
 The original Amiga computer was developed by Commodore which subsequently sold
 the technology to German PC maker Escom AG earlier this year (mf issue 8).
 Although best known for games-playing the Amiga A4000 computer is actually a
 high-quality graphics workstation capable of far more than playing games in
|24-bit colour.  Cleveland's Constabulary, for example, has used the Amiga to
 develop a low-cost multimedia information network for its 1,500 of its        officers.
 
 But whether the first of the new generation machines, dubbed Power Amigas,
 will be straight clones of the PowerPC standard - the Common Hardware
 Reference Platform - is still an open question, as the Escom subsidiary
 debates the best way to maintain backwards compatibility with applications.
 
 The company is also in discussion with Motorola on the practicalities of
 building a variant of the PowerPC 604 processor that includes a 68000-family
 CISC core.  This would ease Amiga's transition to the new RISC architecture.
 Whether such a hybrid chip can or will be built in time to satisfy Amiga
 Technologies' tight deadlines remains to be seen, so the company is also
 pursuing the software emulation path.  A spokesperson acknowledged that Amiga
 is talking to Apple about using its 68k emulation technology, but said that it
 is also talking to alternative emulator software providers.
 
 Running existing Amiga applications on a plain CHRP platform will be tough -
 the Amiga contains a number of proprietary support chips that the software
 expect to be present.  In the first instance, therefore, it seems likely that
 the Power Amigas will be a superset of CHRP containing these extra chips.  The
 first models will also have to incorporate Amiga's proprietary bus to allow
 the use of existing peripherals.  However the spokesperson said that the
 intention is to wean application developers away from accessing the hardware
 directly; so that newer applications will be hardware independent.
 
 Tyschtschenko says that his company intends to actively licence the Amiga OS
 version 4.1 to other computer companies, the eventual aim is to have the
 shrink-wrapped OS available in the shops for users of CHRP machines to buy. He
 is clear that the Amiga's strength is in its software - though asked whether
 in a few years time Amiga Technologies will just be a software house, he
 answers frankly "I don't know, I don't have a crystal ball".
 
 
 
 Visual Information Services Corp is licensing Amiga Technologies GmbH's
 hardware and software technology to use in a television and set-top box
 combination.  The Chicago, Illinois-based company was established specifically
 to develop proprietary and Amiga-based set-tops boxes and has ex-engineering
 staff from Commodore International Ltd among its development team.
 
 Amiga is developing a set-top box based around the Amiga operating system and
 a new and modified version of its A1200 core.
 
 Full details of the product were not available as we went to press but a
 spokesperson for Amiga said that the set-top box will be available next
 September and will come equipped with a CD-ROM drive, floppy drive, printer
 port and serial modem connection or a built in modem.
 
 Another US company, Omnibox is licensing Amiga's technology to develop its own
 set-top box devices.
 
 
 
 Cleveland Constabulary in the North of England is using touch-screen
 Cleveland Constabula: kiosks
 to keep in contact with police officers and the public.  It has spent
 UKP150,000 on 30 kiosks, using 26 of them to relay messages to its 1,500
 employees.  The other four will be in public locations to raise awareness and
 understanding of police activities.  The system is based on Scala InfoChannel.
 Information is entered into the network by the TV and Video Unit at police
 headquarters in Middlesbrough and is sent to the screens using British
 Telecommunications Plc ISDN links.  The system runs on an Amiga 4000 home
 computer fitted with an MPEG video board.

@NODE 2.10. "Offical PowerPC speech"

 This is official, right outta Escom...
 PRESS INFORMATION FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 Amiga goes POWER PC (TM)
 
    Bensheim 07/11/95 (thats 11/7/95 for USA)
 
    During his key note address held in Los Angeles at the Video Toaster
    Expo, Petro Tyschtschenko, CEO and President of Amiga Technologies
    officially announced the Power PC to be the processor used in the
    future generation of Amiga computers.
 
    The first POWER AMIGA will be available 1st quarter 1997 and will
    feature the Power PC 604 RISC CPU. Further models will be available
    later in the entry-level, as well as in the mid-range.
 
    The Power Amigas will be backwards compatible with current models and
    will also feature a new and more powerful chipset.
 
    "Our pre-emptive multitasking Operating System AmigaOS will be ported
    to the Power PC platform first. Our goal is to make our OS hardware
    independent to allow further ports on other platforms", said Petro
    Tyschtschenko.
 
    He also added: "We have a clear business plan: We do things
    consequently, step by step. First, we ramped up the production and set
    up an organisation to handle the Amiga market and satisfy the demand.
    Now that we have achieved this successfully, we focus on research &
    development to bring new and better products on the market. One of the
    mistakes the former Commodore made, was to do too many things at a
    time, too many promises and therefore losing focus on important
    aspects of its business. We have learned from these mistakes and won't
    repeat them. Commitments and promises are nice but facts are better."
 
    The developments will also focus on including more features in the
    AmigaOS, especially regarding network abilities and memory management.
 
    The development of the native RISC AmigaOS will be made internally at
    Amiga Technologies. An R&D department is currently being set up in
    Bensheim with sufficient engineers to meet the announced schedules.
    Former well known Commodore engineers as well as new competencies will
    join the team in Bensheim this year.
 
    This development project will also be involving a dozen companies in
    close partnership with Amiga Technologies GmbH.
 
    More good news for all Amiga users: The Power PC technology will not
    only be available for new Power Amigas. Thanks to a close co-operation
    between Amiga Technologies and Phase V, a German turbo board
    manufacturer, a full range of Power PC boards will also be available
    for the A1200, A3000 and A4000 series.
 
    This will allow a general migration of the Amiga platform towards
    Power PC in a short time, also for current models.
 
    First Power PC boards for current Amigas will be available before end
    of 1996.
 
    Amiga Technologies will be flexible in licensing the RISC Operating
    System as before so that a global solution will be available for all
    above mentioned Amiga computers. This is especially important for the
    foreseeable partnerships.
 
    The 68060 board for the Amiga 4000 T will be available during the
    first quarter of 1996 and will provide the power needed by
    applications like 3D rendering software, compilers and high-end
    graphics software.
 
    During 1996, new 68K based entry-level models will be available. These
    Amigas will be based on the A1200 platform, with faster processors,
    more memory expansion capacity and CD ROM expansion.
 
    Amiga Technologies is a 100% subsidiary of the ESCOM AG and is based
    in Bensheim, Germany.

@NODE 2.11. "Dale's overview of Escom"

                        |By: @{"Dale Poole" Link 8.3.}|


Technical Editor Vents Spleen

I've read Andreas Malerz' report on the Computer '95 show in Cologne.  I've
also read over some notes from Harv Laser on Comdex, and the 2nd Annual
Video Toaster User Expo and you know, some questions have come up in my
mind.  I warn you, these questions are nothing you haven't already heard,
but they bear repeating.

As Andreas' report shows, there still appears to be lots of action on
hardware and software for the Amiga, specifically for video freaks.  As Harv
tells us, Amiga Technologies has unveiled the future of Amigas CPUs and
European sales of A1200's are booming.  There have been many interviews, and
Amiga Technologies has made an upbeat appearance at Comdex, selling more of
the A1200.

Things are looking good for the future, but I'm a little worried about the
here and now.

For the last six months I've been working for a small online advertising and
marketing agency.  They exclusively use those evil PCs.  So, on a daily
basis, I'm hip deep in Windows and all the 'fun' that goes with it.  Like
most Amigans, I find the hardware too damned persnickity and the operating
system abominable.  So why are there so many PCs in use?

I think the answer is software.  There isn't a database that gets anywhere
near MicroSoft's Excel. I still can't find a decent spreadsheet for the
Amiga.  And because I'm stuck at v2.1 of the OS, I can't even cruise the
Internet in glorious colour!  What about games?  Andreas discovered some
interesting new software in Cologne, but also found out that the major
portion of it won't be ported to the Amiga.  It's nice to see that third
party hardware is still a booming market for the Amiga, but what is going to
drive the new Amigas into people's homes and offices?  

I'm happy to hear that Amiga Technologies has settled the Amiga CPU
question, but I'd like to hear more about what's happening on the software
side.  Will there be native Amiga applications developed in parallel with
the new hardware platform?  Or are we going to have to rely on the existing
field of software that is supposed to run on the new systems?

How about the Amiga OS - just what will it be?  I like the ability to point
and click when it's handy, and then the command line when it's handy.  Will
that flexibility remain?  In fact, how much of the WorkBench environment
will be retained?  Will the new OS fly on existing machines, or will we have
to buy a new machine to take advantage of it?  Will we be required to rip
apart our machines every time an upgrade becomes available, or will the new
architecture be open ended enough that some new software is all that will be
required?

Perhaps I'm jumping the gun.  After all, Amiga Technologies has just
confirmed what hardware direction it's headed in.  The new 4000's are
apparently still more than a year away and that should give software
developers ample time to get back on board.

Back to hardware and my last word.  If there is one thing I learned with my
A500, it's that I don't want another bloody wedgie case!  Granted they are
less expensive than their 'big brother' boxes, more appealing to
home/recreational users (whoever the hell *they* are), and pretty much pack
the same horse-power.  However, the upgrade path for a wedgie case still
sucks out loud, what, with misshapen harddisk plug-ons, motherboard mangling
RAM add-ons and more cables and
stupid AC adaptors than the average table/desk can accommodate.  With all
the hardware development going on, no one has come up with an intelligent
design for wedgie upgrades.  I'm not so sure such a thing can be done.

A1200's in the wedgie case are driving Amiga sales right now making it hard
to rationalize any criticism of them, but is that because the case is
acceptable, or is it because they're the only Amigas in production right
now, and those, only because they were the easiest machine to get tooled up
for, in time for the big Christmas season?

If any style of case is missing from the Amiga lineup, it's a laptop.  I've
heard all the arguments about colour displays being inadequate, blah blah
blah.  PC laptops seems to do just fine in colour or black and white, and I
see no reason why Amiga Technologies' Gilles Bourdin has to shy away from
photographs, for fear of being spotted using an IBM laptop.

I use a black and white Toshiba laptop as I scoot from one client to the
next.  Sure the display sucks, and sure it's horrible old Windows, but I
can't haul around either my A500 or A2500, so that laptop has become my most
important business tool.

As usual, with our beloved machine, there are more questions than answers.
If I've sounded pessimistic, my apologies, but these critical times for the
Amiga and Amiga Technologies continue and won't end any time soon.  The good
news is, Amiga Technologies seems to be making the type of decisions that
formerly were paid no attention.  I'm also encouraged that top-level staff
for Amiga Technologies continue to make appearances at shows that attract
all types of users.

All I ask for now is new software, new machines, and that both be available
here in North America.

BTW, anyone know where I can get OS3.+ at less than $159 bucks?

I remain,

Daleus, Curmudgeon-at-Large

@NODE 2.13. "Colongne Expo : A review"
Retrived from, you guessed it. The UseNet! :)


WOA Cologne, day 1 (friday november 10th)

We've just come back from the World of Amiga show in Cologne; in one word:

        MAGNIFICENT!

The Amiga really is back.  Our impressions are reported below.

There were two halls:  One for the Amiga, and one for the "other platforms"
(PC, Mac, Acorn).  The "other" hall was fairly quiet, and we visited the
Amiga side mostly.  Amiga Technologies logos and the much-advertised slogan
"Back for the Future" were everywhere.

A1200 Magic Packs were sold by many companies, as well as the new M1438S
monitor.  Although there was relatively little new software, the atmosphere
was very upbeat--which was perfectly appropriate.

We stopped at several stands for a closer look:

AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES:

AT had a big attractive-looking stand in the middle, manned exclusively by
representatives of 3rd-party developers (4th Level Development, Haage &
Partner, Interworks, and others) in cool black T-shirts with the AT logo.
Machines were mostly high-end: Very sexy A4000Ts, all fitted with MagicWB
and ethernet/arcnet/ graphics cards etc.  Next to each machine was a
summary of the goodies inside.

There were also several A1200s showing off the I-Glasses, and even one with
synthesizer keyboard for the musically inclined.

The AT stand made a very fresh, bright, professional impression.  While the
machines were all equipped differently and manned by staff from different
companies, the overall look was still consistent and well-organized.

I would sure buy a computer from those people ;-)

In any case, we bought some very flashy T-shirts with the new logo.  Many
people were wearing similar ones with the "Intel Outside" logo on the back,
but I don't know where they got them.


PHASE 5:

Believe it or not, the Phase 5 stand had a real PowerPC development board!
It contains two CPUs (68030 and a 604 PPC chip) and appears to be a
prototype of the PowerUp card which should be available sometime next year
at prices in the 1000-2000 DM price range.  It will be available in both
|603e and 604 versions.

According to a leaflet we picked up, Phase 5 is porting Exec to native PPC
code and other libraries will follow.  Old programs will be run under 68k
emulation. Partners mentioned ("we are not alone") include Softwood,
Almathera and Maxon.

Commercial developers are to receive their boards early '96.

Also at the Phase 5 stand was the 2-GO! DSP card which combines four DSP
processors with a 50 MIPS RISC controller and a 100 MFLOPS FPU.  Internal
data throughput is said to be 4.2 Gigabytes per second, external throughput
is 32Mb (Zorro III).  The card is supposed to execute 2 BILLION
instructions per second!

The card can be used for things like encoding or decoding JPEG pictures and
MPEG animations, and realtime sound and graphics manipulations. Encoding a
JPEG picture (res. 352*240) takes only 8 milliseconds!

As the slogan said:  "Where do you want to be tomorrow?"

We also learned that the 3.0 release of CyberGraphX will include 3-D
primitives. CyberGraphX 3.0 will also be available for the PowerUp & 2-GO!
boards.


MS MACROSYSTEM GMBH:

These good people were showing off their 060-based Draco with the XiPaint
graphics package which seemed to be selling like hotcakes.  One machine was
quietly mixing away at some real-time video input, while the eager masses
were lining up to get the feel of Final Writer on another.  It was quite an
impressive sight; pages were flying by at a speed that must have been close
to the monitor's refresh rate!

One of our "mission objectives" was to find out whether WordPerfect will
run on the Draco.  The staff were very helpful and even let me run WP from
my own disk, which I had brought along for this purpose.  It gave us no
trouble during our very brief test (although the representative told us
this did depend on using Topaz 8 as the screen font) and felt very
responsive and flashy compared to our "good old" WARPEngine/040/40!

MacroSystem GmbH has nothing whatsoever to do, by the way, with either
MacroSystem Development (of WARPEngine fame) or with the less well-known
company MakroSystem.

On the price list, curiously enough, was also a 33MHz "Draco 040" for DM
|4495. The 060 version costs DM 5995, and includes CD-ROM and 4Mb of
graphics memory.


MUI 3.0:

Tons of pamflets told us the new version of the Magical User Interface has
now been released.  It was available at Hirsch & Wolf's stand for DM 40.
One of these little pamflets was actually the first thing we saw as we came
up the stairs.

Advertized features include Bubble Help, Drag-and-Drop and many that we've
forgotten.  We apologize.


MAXON COMPUTER GMBH:

We were much impressed by a video produced by Tobias Richter using their
Cinema 4D product range.  Some of this stuff even looked better than
Babylon 5!  The package is being ported to Mac and Windows, and a small
demo rendering on the PowerMac of a spiral staircase and a few smaller
objects took just a few seconds;  the Windows port wasn't as far along yet.

For good measure we asked to see a demonstration of their C++ compiler as
well, but they weren't really planning to give any.  Unfortunately no free
demo version was available either.  Casually mentioning our plans to write
a report on our experiences *almost* worked miracles:  On the verge of
giving us a free copy including manuals, manager Harald Schneider finally
understood that we were not writing for a magazine.  More on this below.


HAAGE & PARTNER:

Out of the blue, there is a shiny new C/C++ compiler for the Amiga!  It's
called StormC and comes with a very intuitive graphical user interface.
There appears to be some kind of relationship with Maxon, which Maxon's
manager didn't seem very eager to discuss--mostly due to being in a hurry,
I must add.

We got ourselves a preview version of StormC and plan to post a review
later on; unfortunately we won't be able to compare it to Maxon's compiler.
Perhaps I dropped the term "c.s.a.misc" a little too casually, giving the
manager the false impression that this was a magazine we were writing for
(oh well, if ever we do start an Amiga magazine I guess CSA Misc would be
as good a name as any other).

There was some confusion as to the relationship between StormC and Maxon
C++; according to one Maxon representative, StormC was based on the Maxon
compiler. He even told us that some requesters in StormC used the name
Maxon in stead of StormC, but searching the entire preview distribution for
that word yielded nothing.  Perhaps this was just a misunderstanding.

The Haage & Partner representative said they had been working on StormC for
just under a year with a team of five programmers, but it was easier
because they used a lot of "older" code--whatever that may mean.

At any rate, the compiler looks GREAT!  It has intelligent Drag-and-Drop,
clickable error messages, easy project management, an editor with syntax
highlighting, a debugger which interacts with the editor, and even resource
tracking.  If SAS comes back (and I hope they will) they could face some
stiff competition from this newcomer.


That's all folks.  After today, there can be no doubt that AT is serious
about the Amiga!

@NODE 2.14. "Speech at Kolen"


AT speech #2 at Kolen

 
 Koln 11/11
 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you very much for attending this software evening,
 it is nice to see so many people interested in developing software on the
 Amiga.  Amiga Technologies began as a production company in May 1995.
 
 Its goal was then to ramp up the production of Amiga computers to bring them
 back onto the market.  We have done it.  Then, as soon as the products were
 available, Amiga Technologies evolved to a computer sales company to
 distribute its products world-wide.  We had to meet the demand that has been
 waiting for more than one year.  We have done it.
 
 Now, Amiga is turning into a true Computer manufacturer, we are finally
 building up our Research and Development team in Bensheim.  We are hiring
 former Commodore engineers as well as new talented people to be able to
 respect the announced schedules for the Power Amiga.  Lets do it!
 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, we want to show our commitment to the Amiga platform,
 not as a quick money maker for the Christmas season, but as one of the most
 important strategic challenges in the ESCOM group.  Amiga shall become the
 best platform for Multimedia, 3D software, graphics processing, Internet and
 many more applications.
 
 The software market is always looking for powerful platforms.  Especially 3D
 software needs great amounts of MIPS.  This is going to be addressed first
 with the 060 board that we will market in early 96.  Then, in 1st quarter 97,
 the Power PC 604 will replace the 060 in the new high-end model.  Of course,
 the operating system will have to be ported to the new RISC-Processor.  This
 will be done internally at Amiga Technologies by our R&D department.
 
 In the meantime, there will also be new products based on the A1200 concept.
 We plan to present the A1200 + in May.  This model will feature either the
 Coldfire processor from Motorola, or the 68030 at 40 MHz.  SIMM sockets will
 be integrated directly on the motherboard to allow easy memory expansion.  The
 A1200 + is scheduled for the CEBIT in March 96.
 
 Another product will be the black box.  This is a set top box that will
 feature an enhanced A1200 core, along with all connectors needed for
 communication, printing, audio in and out and a remote control.  It will have
 a HI-FI-like design that will be created by Frog design.  The product will of
 course be equipped with a CD ROM drive and a floppy disk drive.
 
 We are also making an Internet package with all software needed to become an
 unbeatable surfer.  These networking features are planned to be part of the OS
 in a near future.  It will first be marketed as a complete package including
 modem and cables, with the software preinstalled on the harddrive.  A plug and
 play solution.
 
 We also plan the Q-Drive to be available shortly after the fair.  This quad
 speed CD ROM drive plugs into the PCMCIA connector and is provided with
 software to enable it to play CD 32 titles.
 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, as you can see, the Amiga family will become larger very
 soon.  To welcome these products that will without doubt be very successful on
 the market, we want to encourage you to produce software for them.
 
 We now have a developer support set up and running.  Let me tell you a few
 words about its organisation.  There will be a secured section on the WEB
 server, only accessible to registered developers.  The address of the WEB
 server is www.amiga.de
 
 We will have two types of developers:
 
 Non-commercial and commercial developers.  To become a non-commercial
 developer, the candidate has to show an existing program or product, even
 public domain.  The annual fee is 100 USD.  For becoming a commercial
 developer, one has to provide proof of a commercial product, either completed
 or in advanced stage of development.
 
 The fee for becoming a commercial developer is 300 USD a year.  Former
 registered Commodore developers will have to register again with Amiga
 Technologies.  This is necessary for us because we do not have the complete
 Commodore developer database and also because an Amiga Technologies NDA has to
 be signed.  All developers will also have access to the beta versions of the
 AMIGA OS for testing purposes, they will have access to development tools, to
 hardware documentation and to our restricted newsgroups.
 
 Developers will also have special purchase conditions on Amiga hardware. There
 will also be a periodical newsletter.
 
 The support for developers will be accessible from the Internet and through a
 closed network as in former Commodore times.  If you have further questions
 about software support, you are welcome to ask after the session. We know that
 there are many people who are convinced that Amiga is the best system and
 those people believe in the Amiga platform as well as we do.
 
 This, Ladies and Gentlemen is very encouraging for us.  I believe that most of
 the people attending here are Amiga enthusiastic and am glad to see such a
 strong commitment.
 
 There is one thing I would like to tell you: write software for the Amiga,
 Amiga will help you to do this.
 
 We managed to revive the Amiga hardware Now it's to you, together with us, to
 revive its software.  Negotiations with many software houses world-wide have
 started.  Our common goal should be to strengthen the Amiga software platform
 for the future.  Please take this message: Amiga is working tightly together
 with hardware companies to get new extensions, license our technology and
 create new exciting products.
 
 We are motivated by the success we had with our current models and look
 forward to bring you new products very soon.
 
 Thank you for your attention.

@NODE 2.15. "Speech at Cologne by M.Schmitt"

Just in case you do not know who Manfred is, he is the CEO of Escom. 


 [Manfred Schmitt speaking at the Amiga-Messe during Computer '95 in Cologne -
 [11/11/95]
 
 Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
 Since we have many guests from outside of Germany here, this conference is
 going to be held in English.
 
 My name is Manfred Schmitt, I am founder and chairman of ESCOM AG.  I would
 like to welcome you to this software evening and also thank you very much for
 attending.
 
You surely all know ESCOM as one of the leading PC retailers in Europe. In the
 past fiscal year 1994, we had a turnover of 1.85 billion Deutschmarks,
 employed 2300 people and sold 410.000 PC's throughout Europe.  With 450
 outlets, we cover 9 european countries.  Core markets are Germany, where we
 run some 140 shops, and Great Britain.  In the UK, we are the biggest
 dedicated PC retailer with 200 shops by the end of the year.
 
 But PC dealer is no longer the appropriate term that characterizes our
 business.  Our strategy is changing from a mere PC retailer into a multimedia
 company.  And on this path, the acquisition of the intellectual property of
 Commodore and Amiga half a year ago was an important milestone.
 
 You surely might confirm that Amiga is a leverage for the growing multimedia
 market.  And you might also ask me what the guys from ESCOM have done in the
 past months with the Amiga and what they are going to do in the near future.
 
 Amiga Technologies has grown to a small but efficient multinational company
 and now employs 40 people.  The Amiga product range is back on the market as
 announced and distributed in more than 20 countries.
 
 This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the result of the determination, motivation and
 competence from the Amiga team, led by Petro Tyschtschenko and Stefan Domeyer.
 The plans have been respected.  Congratulations to all of them.
 
 We all know, the Amiga is an amazing computer.  It is even more than just a
 computer.  It is an institution with user groups, a community, fans and even
 lovers.  There are Amiga-fairs, Amiga-magazines, Amiga clubs, even T-shirts
 and tea cups !
 
 Usually, in the computer business, when the leading product disappears, the
 market collapses immediately.  The Amiga was gone for one and a half year but
 the market, even if it shrunk a bit, was still there and remained significant.
 
 This is something that is quite remarkable.  It shows the quality of the
 Amiga-concept and the dedication of the user-base.
 
 I think that some of our competitors are underestimating the power and
 potential of what the name Amiga represents.  We do not.  We perfectly know
 what we have and believe me, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to make
 something out of it!
 
 The Amiga is not only gifted by its user-community, it also has one of the
 best developer bases.  Public domain and shareware programs on the Amiga are
 better and the quantity available is unmatched on other platforms.
 
 The utility of such a developer community dedicated to the Amiga is evident.
 It provides good software and very often, commercial products emerge and
 expand the software-market.  This is something essential and therefore,
 developer support is one of our top-priorities.  It will be mainly available
 as on-line services via Web pages or FTP servers.
 
 We intend to simplify as much as possible the certification procedures. Please
 feel free to ask for information during the fair at our booth or later this
 evening during the questions and answer session.  The person to contact is Mr
 Hohmann.
 
 We also set up contacts with software-editing companies to make sure that
 their development for Amiga products is resumed.  New contacts to non-Amiga
 editors are also on our todo list.
 
 Since we started-up the Amiga operations, there have been several rumours
 about our future plans.  One of these rumours said that Amiga is just a quick
 shot for the Christmas season and that the project would be dropped shortly
 afterwards.
 
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is most certainly a dream of the competition!
 
 Indeed, Amiga is not a short-term project, it is a strategic element in our
 multimedia strategy as I mentionned before.
 
 To give the Amiga the future it deserves, as a major platform for Multimedia,
 video and 3D applications, it is necessary to upgrade its present capacities.
 That's why we have decided to leave the Motorola 68000 range of processors and
 upgrade the system with the power PC processor next year.  The future machines
 will of course run with Amiga OS.
 
 The choice of the Power PC was made for its speed, and also because it is
 actually the only RISC processor that is currently used in personal computers,
 which will insure us that needed quantities will be available at attractive
 prices on a mass market.
 
 Amiga OS is actually what makes the strength of the platform it runs on. We
 are aware that we have an operating system that has real multitasking from the
 beginning without the need of excessive amounts of memory like other operating
 systems.  This is the reason why we will concentrate on improving and porting
 Amiga OS to other processors.  It is the best way to enlarge the installed
 base and to gain market shares over Windows and Macintosh systems.
 
 The implementation of the Power PC processor will be a first step in that
 direction.  Later, this processor will replace the 68000 chips in the rest of
 the Amiga product range.  This is possible thanks to the range of versions
 that Motorola provides, from the 602 up to the 604.
 
 Multimedia does not only mean sound and Animation but also communication. We
 will use the Amiga-technology to provide very cost effective on-line
 solutions.  These can be marketed as set-top boxes or as Amiga computers
 equipped with the necessary hard- and software.
 
 To be a player in the on-line market, one has also to provide on-line-services
 like Web pages or FTP servers for the Internet.  This has already been done
 for Amiga, Commodore and ESCOM.  Our customers can now use the Internet to
 find information and support for the computer they are using.
 
 The actual computer market is widely occupied by Intel and Microsoft
 platforms.  We think that this combination is not satisfying for all uses.
 There is a strong market for the home computing below 1000 DM.  For Internet
 surfing, spending 2500 DM for a PC is not what I would call a home oriented
 solution.  These are definitely market segments where the Amiga 1200 can be
 more competitive.
 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, I hope that this meeting will be a start-up for a good
 co-operation between Amiga Technologies and software publishers.
 
 Thank you for your attention.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 2.16. "Speech by Petro.T at Solectron"

 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, distinguished guests
 
 Good afternoon...  Welcome to our first press conference here with Solectron
 and thank you very much for attending.
 
 Let me introduce myself, my name is Petro Tyschtschenko, I am the president at
 Amiga Technologies GmbH.  I have the great pleasure to be here to tell you
 about the backgrounds of the Amiga rebirth.
 
 Amiga is back, back for the future.  It finally happened !  Amiga is back on
 the market.  This was an amazing task to accomplish and many people from
 several companies helped to make impossible things possible.  I would like to
thank the people from Solectron for their involvement, their competence and
 professionalism.  What they achieved in the last two months is truly an
 exceptional logistic performance.  I would also like to thank Motorola for
 their precious help and cooperation in making the rebirth of the Amiga
 possible.  Thanks to Mitsumi for supplying us just in time our special Amiga
 keyboards.  Thank you also to Microvitec, who I believe provided us the best
 Amiga monitor ever.  As you can see, the Amiga project involved several
 companies in a remarkable team and the ambitious goal was reached in time.
 
 Our Amiga story began in 1985.  The first Amiga was presented in New York.
 Since then, it has established itself as the platform of those who want true
 multitasking and integrated Multimedia.  More, ladies and gentlemen than just
 typing letters or numbers on a PC.
 
 Amiga Technologies GmbH is a 100% subsidiary of ESCOM AG.  ESCOM AG is a
 public company.  25 % belongs to Quelle, 10 % to Siemens-Nixdorf, 12,5 %
 to RWE, 38,5 % to Manfred Schmitt, founder and chairman of the board, 14 %
           split to other shareholders.  Amiga Technologies GmbH was
           founded in May 1995.

  We are a young company but we already have historical dates : here
 is the first Amiga 1200 board made by Solectron.  which I just received
 from Mister Gallant.  It came out of the line on the 13th of September
 |1995.  A rebirth in France.  To be quite honest this one was faulty, it
 had two condensators soldered with reverse polarity.  This board
 functioned only a few minutes.  But the error was recognized quickly...
 fixed...  and for the forthcoming boards, all tests passed successfully.
 Be aware: For all machines, we do systematic testing on each unit.
 
 Now lets talk about the story of the Amiga rebirth: Everything began in June
 |1995, after ESCOM AG acquired the rights to the Amiga Technology from the
 former Commodore company.  I went to the Far East first to the Philippines,
 Cavite, the city where the old Commodore company had a manufacturing facility.
 My goal was to make sure that we could get the component stocks left there by
 Commodore.  Everything there was an enormous mess and nightmare, nothing was
 organized.  I have had first doubts that we never could do it at all.  June:
 raining season in the Philippines Typhoons time and floods.  Pinatubo ?
 quiet, thank god.  But I didn't give up and with the help of Mr.  Gwynne
 Thomas, who I'd like to thank for the wonderful job he made, we succeeded in
 making things move in this complicated component business.  Taylor made Amiga
 components were gathered together through liquidators all around the world and
 shipped from the Far East to Europe and the USA.  It was really a difficult
 task.
 
 Originally, it was planned to produce Amigas in the United Kingdom, because
 there were people there that had great experience with Amiga production. But
 we finally decided to go for a partnership with Solectron here in France.  We
 didn't leave the UK though, since we have our partner Microvitec for Monitors.
 Our M1438S monitor has already been celebrated by the Amiga-press for its
 perfect compatibility with Amiga video-modes. There will be a press conference
 in Bradford on the 17th of October to celebrate this cooperation.
 
 Bordeaux is perfect for us.  Not only the wine, we also appreciate the
 pleasant surroundings and the competencies of the people at Solectron.
 Solectron, maybe you have noticed this already, won the Malcolm Baldridge
 National Quality Award, which guaranteed us that our machines would be
 reliable.  Now that the first units went over the shelves and that we get the
 first positive impressions from our customers, we know that we have made the
 right choice.  I have learned here in Bordeaux: "impossible n'est pas
 Solectron".
 
 Our Amiga production that has been set to 100.000 units for the three last
 months of 1995 is already sold out in preorders.  All these machines will be
 produced in Bordeaux.  We are pleased by the demand from our dealers. We are
 also pleased to hear from the Amiga press that they are flooded with phone
 calls from people who want to know where they can get Amigas. To satisfy this
 demand, our logistic system is working perfectly.  We can ship directly from
 Bordeaux to our different customers.  Indeed, with such a system, we are a
 sales company and not a warehouse company.  This enables us to keep down stock
 costs to a minimum.
 
 Ladies and gentlemen, as I said before, this is a very special day for my team
 and myself, we are proud that we did it.  I am very satisfied of the people at
 Amiga Technologies, who were available anytime during four months to help
 building up our company.  In spite of all the rumors spread by doomsayers on
 the market, we respected the schedules and the Amiga is back as promised.  I
 would also like to thank the Amiga press for their support and the Amiga users
 for their endless patience.

 From the A1000 to the A1200... Amiga's were always ahead of their time,
Even now when Ibm, and Mac's are catching up the Amiga still leaves them
to trail behind. Even through the Amiga has not been so popular, I believe
it will be. People will discover the magic of the Amiga, And leave their
other computer to collect dust.
