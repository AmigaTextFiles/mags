<UL>Welcome to <B>Amiga Network News</B>, a &quot;very cool Usenet summary area
that gives you a reliable synopsis of the most important Usenet events,
including links to those involved&quot;.</P>
<P>This is the Aminet archive; make sure to visit the Internet homepage of
<A HREF="http://www2.vo.lu/homepages/ckemp/News/" TARGET="_parent">Amiga Network News</A> for the
latest news and rumours.</P>
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#CC3333"><B>Usage
</B></FONT></P>
<UL>When using Frames, the Amiga Network News main window is divided into two parts:
The <I>Summaries</I>, where the newsgroup summaries are displayed and the <I>Articles</I>
section where additional information about the respective Summaries is displayed.
When you first access ANN, the Articles section will contain this Usage information,
later it will often be used to display the full Usenet copies of the summarised
articles.</P>
<P>If you are not using frames, additional information will replace the
Summaries and you need to go back to see the Summaries again.</P>
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#CC3333"><B>Notifications
</B></FONT></P>
<UL>To get a notification mail every time ANN is updated, just send an
email to <A HREF="mailto:ckemp@vo.lu">ckemp@vo.lu</A>. Note that
this is just my personal CC list, no commercial offer.</P>
<P>Alternatively, you can use the following form <B>while you are online</B>:
<FORM ACTION="http://www2.vo.lu/cgi-bin/vomail.exe" METHOD="post">
<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="email_server" VALUE="mail.vo.lu">
<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="email_to" value="ckemp@vo.lu">

<P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#CC3333"><B>Disclaimer
</B></FONT></P>
<UL>All information provided on these pages is unofficial and based upon
Usenet articles. I'm just doing summaries of what other people said,
which implies that I may be paraphrasing, shortening and translating
the content of a posting. This means there may be unintentional errors
or omissions - if you have any doubts, feel free to read the original
postings or contact the authors through the respective links below the
summaries.
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#CC3333"><B>Thanks
</B></FONT></P>
<UL>I'd like to thank Andr&eacute; Hoffmann for forwarding me Usenet articles between
December 98 and July 1997. Without him, this page would probably not exist.</P>
<P>Thanks also go to Paul Morabito and Wayne Hunt for mirroring these
pages, as well as to everybody who has contributed to the success of
ANN.
