<P> This is the first issue of what I would like to be a small electronic
magazine. I hear you say: "Another one?". Well, yes, cause with some
exceptions all the magazines I have read were not as good as I thought they
could be.
<P> Most of them, thought very good, are limited to about specific things
such as programming, games, demos, while other relates about things which
are interesting but very far from everyday usage of our marvellous computer.
What I would like to do here, is to create a magazine which cover all, or
the major part, of the fields the Amiga is still good at for the usual hobby
user, not for professional user.
<P> However, being electronically spread, the magazine can grow and expand
to cover all the relevant fields you want to know with no cost. This
however, only if I can find someone interested in helping me in this thing.
<P> This number is the result of my own only work, and so it is quite
limited in its contents (I'm not God), but I hope the quality will increase
as soon as new volunteers will join me. If you are interested please read
the <A HREF="../misc/helpme.html">'looking for help'</A> article, thanks.
<P> I hope this magazine will have tutorials on interesting and difficult
things like programming and raytracing. I will be glad if some experts of
those fields are going to help me, 'cause I can't really do all myself. On
the other hands, tutorials won't be the unique, nor the major aspect of
<B>Tarantula</B>, but there will be articles on the best and most used PD &amp;
Shareware programs, reviews on hardware and possibly commercial and
professional software. Moreover there'll be news and reports of thing
happening in the world that can interest us, our computer and its future.
<BR> There will also be space for your mails and a market corner.
<P> I hope this will be enough for everyone, but if it's not there will be
space for everything you want (provided enough people are going to join this
project).
<P> Much work has been made trying to create a good looking, easy to read
hypertext compatible with all the most diffused HTML Browser on the market.
I have tested the magazine on freeware available Amiga browsers, such as
Voyager and AWeb-II demo which are both good for local browsing even though
both have problems aligning graphics. While waiting for them to fix those
problems I have decided to keep the alignement feature Netscape compatible
so that at least on that browser the pages will look the right way.
<P> Although I like frames (unlike many other "surfers", but I can't really
understand why) together with tables, I have not used them as till now no
Amiga browser has been able to handle them in a decent way. With frames and
complete tables support the electronic magazines could look the same way as
the printed magazines (with columns, separate independant boxes, different
colours on the same page etc..). I hope we, as Amiga users, will be able to
enjoy that soon too. As soon as that will happen (it seems VoyagerNT and
IBrowse are getting there, even though no PD version are available), I will
add these feature to the look of the magazine.
<P> The name refers to a well known spider. In fact everyone today speak
about the Web and its resources but just few users contribute to it actively
(beside occupying lots of bandwith). Tarantula is aimed to contribute to the
World Wide Web as much as it can.
<P> So let's start this first number.
