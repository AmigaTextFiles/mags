<P> Hi all, <BR>
I hope you have already read the <A HREF="../edit/intro.html">Intro</A>
which summs a bit the purpose of this work. <BR>
I think you know the state our computer is now. When I'm writing this, still
none has finally managed to purchase the reamins of the Amiga technology
after the death of ESCOM. <BR>
But what surprises me more is this fact that the name Amiga is dangerous in
the financial and technology world. It may be cursed, seen all the damages it
has done since it was born. Or maybe just unlucky.
<P>But what does matter is the fact that the Amiga technology, from the
hardware to the operating system is now 5 years old with respect to the last
technology. Even though the ideas and the ways the Amiga has been developed
has made it (her?) years ahead of all the others, now the other ones can
enjoy the fruits of the last years of development on fields like graphics
card , sound card, new I/O interfaces, faster memory, processor and
software.
<P> 5 years old technology is very old, expecially today which has suddenly
seen the birth of new ideas and possibilities like the global
interconnection (Intenet) and Java. And we have still not a frame compatible
browser, nor a Java compiler or even a hardware which can handle the new
33.6K modems at full speed but on the fastest and most expensive machines.
I'm just wondering what I have to do if I buy the new Epson Stylus 600...
where and when will be the driver available?
<P> These are, in my opinion, the immediate problems we have to face
everyday. The fact that my brother can turn on his Pentium and play
MechWarrior2 exploiting DirectX 3 or F1GP2 while we have still slow and ugly
Doom clones. The fact that if I want to make a broshure there's no software
on the Amiga able to reorder the facing pages which are printed on the same
sheet. The fact that there's not a useable 3D CAD and the existing ones are
Autocad incompatible.
<P> What I'm tring to point out is the fact that we lack professional
software, including really good up to date games (I'm quite bored playing
Civilization or DuneII). And those who once produced masterpieces like
LightWave, Scala or PageStream2 have now abandoned the ship or have
multiplied their efforts trying to port their software to other platforms
leaving the Amiga market in a secondary (or tertiary) place in their duties.
It's not a mystery that we had to wait more than 2 years for the last
version of PageStream (3.2) which is still full of bugs, while the same
program is going to be ported to the PC compatibles (I don't know with which
quality and possibilities against monsters like XQuarkExpress, PageMaker or
Corel Ventura).
<P> Not everything is so dark. We now have the biggest archive of PD
available software (Aminet) which has passed the OS/2 archive in size and
number of files; it's a huge place where to find small programs which can
even cost nothing useful for our everyday needs. And seen how our OS is
highly customizable, we can find all sort of programs able to enhance its
capabilities to a cartain amount.
<P> But still all this is something created to try to fill the gap between
the power of our computer with respect to other system, PC compatibles
first.
<P> What we really need is a complete update of our machine, starting from
the improvement of custom chips (some of them are now 12 years old!!), the
CPU (68060@50MHz are still to slow for certain professional works), the bus,
the expandibility (which was almost ignored before), the chance to use cheap
hardware thought for the PC compatibles together with more poweful and
expensive hardware dedicated only to our computer (I can't understand why
Amiga HD floppies cost 5 times more that PC compatibles ones even though
they have to be (slightly) modified or why there's not a cheap 16bit sound
card as for PC).
<P> Forgotten the idea that some "angel" coming from the Heaven could made
the Amiga raise from its ashes, new companies have started on their own the
projecting of new machines, some of which follow the original Amiga idea of
"custom is better", while other companies have just chosen for the more
profitable (and less dangerous) way of cloning already existing systems like
PowerMachintosh. The common things on which almost everyone has agreed is
the fact that the new Amiga, whichever will be its name, aspect or basic
architecture will use the PowerPC processor as its "brain".
<P> PowerPC processors, for those who do not know, constitute a very good
and powerful family of RISC CPUs, capable to compete with the most modern
CPUs in terms of speed and prices and have the advantage that their speed is
continously increased (in MHz). Till now their maximum speed has been
brought to 240MHz, but 300 and 500 MHz PPC versions have been announced for
the end of this year. You can get much more informations directly from
Motorola WWW site at <A HREF="http://www.mot.com">www.mot.com</A> and
looking for the semiconductor sector of the company.
<P> I just hope we'll finish having a better machine in terms of hardware so
that the quality of software can be raised to a level that is not thinkable
on PC compatibles (especially now that the market is monopolized by
Microsoft and their crap products). Only this will allow our machine to
spread in all fields where high quality is more important than using
something compatible with the rest of the world.
<P>
