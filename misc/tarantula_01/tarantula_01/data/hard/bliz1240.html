<P> <B>PRODUCT NAME</B>
<P> Blizzard 1240 T/ERC
<P> <B>BRIEF DESCRIPTION</B>
<P> The Blizzard 1240 T/ERC Accelerator Memory Board is a 68040 40 MHz
accelerator that features autoconfig RAM expansion that accepts till 128MB
SIMM 32 or 36 bit, 70ns or faster, an optional SCSI-2 DMA module that has
another SIMM socket connector and supports throughput till 10MB/sec. The
module is the same as the Blizzard 1240-IV or 1260.
<P> The 68040 is complete, that is it has MMU and FPU built in fully
working. I don't know the real meaning of the Eco Recycled term (the ERC in
the name of the board), but I could read the original Motorola specs on the
040 chip as the heat sink covers only the bottom part of them: the chip is
declared as XC68040RC40Mzh so it is NOT a overclocked one.

<P> <B>ITALIAN DISTRIBUTORS</B>
<P> There are quite many distributors in Italy of Amiga and Blizzard
products. I have purchased mine at NewVideo, Limbiate (Milano), though due
to their lack of professionality I would not recommend. If they were
available I would have bought it from DBLine srl. - V.LE RIMEMBRANZE 26/C -

<P> <UL>
Amiga 1200 model from Commodore, revision 1B, 2MB Chip RAM, <BR>
16MB 70(?) ns 72-pin, 32-bit SIMM, single sided. <BR>
Kickstart in RAM, V39.106. Workbench 39.29. <BR>
2 floppy drives. <BR>

Tried a GoldStar 8x IDE CD-ROM for some time. <BR>
</UL>
<P> The computer has been mounted into an old big PC desktop. The original
stock Amiga power supply just powers the motherboard and the accelerator
board, while all the rest (HD, floppy drives, keyboard, CPU fan and the
monitor as well) is powered by the desktop 200W power supply.
<P> <B>INSTALLATION</B>
<P> Provided you have a towered house A1200 the installation is very easy.
As the 68040 becomes very hot a heat sink and a fan are provided as
standard. All you need is to plug the power connector of the fan into a 4
pins connector that is equal to those used to power the HDs. There are quite
lots of them spare coming from a PC power supply so there should not be
problems.
<P> Before closing everything you have just to choose if you want to disable
the MAPROM feature that automatically maps the Kickstart ROM into RAM just
by setting the unique jumper existing on the board.
<P> The memory SIMM must be inclined so a double faced SIMM is not usable.
<P> The good thing that differentiates this board from similar ones like the
Apollo one, for example, is the fact that all the surface mounted
components, the SIMM socket and the CPU as well are all positioned on the
bottom side of the board, that is they are upside down looking at the
ground. This means that, with some caution and small efforts it can be
installed into a normal A1200 case without worrying about the heat produced.
<P> For mounting the board in a standard A1200 case see later.
<P> The manual, for the following surprise, will explain the installation of
the board in the normal A1200 case. However it explains very well all the
steps to do before you can power up your Amiga. The addendum sheet, that you
must read before the user manual, states that the fan MUST be connected and
checked for proper function and that operation without cooling is not
possible.
<P> <B>OVERVIEW</B>
<P> The board comes into the phase5 classic black box. As this is the 3rd
phase5 board I have purchased I can say that the package is similar to the
other ones, that is of very high quality. The big white stick on the box
clearly states that you need a towered house A1200 to use this board.
<P> Opening the box reveals a surprise, and what a surprise. The box contain
the user manual, a registration card, an addendum sheet and the anti-static
envelop that contains..... a Blizzard 1260 card! The board in fact is the
same as the 1260 with just the CPU and the CPU power adapter changed. phase
5 states in the addendum sheet that they are going to provide a 68060
upgrade kit which will transform the board in a full 1260 card.
<P> All the documentation provided is both in English and German, which is a
very good thing. However the manual is the same as the 1260 board and the
differences are listed just in the addendum sheet. This is not a problem as
the only thing that changes is the fact that there's no software to install
before using the board. You just need the 68040.library that should be
present on the WB disks. I say should because I didn't find it and I had to
copy it from one of the many PD CD-ROMs I have.
<P> <B>REVIEW</B>
<P> So let's see how good this board is.
<P> Once installed everything correctly (remember to connect the CPU fan if
you don't want a hole in your tower case) I just powered everything on.
<P> I have to admit that, before this board, I have been using my A1200 in
the basic configuration (only 2MB of chip ram) for many months. It was
amazing seeing a basic boot happening in 3 secs. But what is most impressive
is the update of the windows! Now all the gfx functions are performed in an
incredible speed, and even a 64 color WB on a AGA machine is fast. Using
graphics programs like DPaint in 256 colors is now really possible without
falling asleep waiting for the image to appear.
<P> The board comes with a battery backed clock so it is now possible to
have a permanent clock on the WB screen and use all those programs that need
to know the real date.
<P> The MMU finally allows programmers (like me) to use debugging tools like
enforcer or for those who really want to to install any UNIX operating
system (like Linux or NetBSD).
<P> The powerful 68040 FPU running at 40MHz allows the use of intensive
calculation programs (fractals, rendering and raytracing, general math based
programs) in a productive way without having to wait a night of full
calculations to see the results of the simplest scene. The only problem is
the fact that the 68040 FPU lacks some of the most used 68881/2 FPU
instructions. The 040 (and the 060 too) have in fact the basic FPU
instructions to build the other more complex (and more used) ones, but these
basic instructions are executed much faster than in the 68882. The real
problem is that the major part of the software available, when compiled to
use the FPU, is compiled for the 68882 and so an external library is needed
(the 68040.library) to trap all the FPU exception produced by the
unavailable instructions and to transform them in the right basic
instructions that the 68040 can process. This thing results in a big slow
down of all the FPU calculations, and sometimes the integer version of the
same program can be slightly faster. This, of course, affects only programs
compiled for the 68882 FPU, while programs compiled for the 040 can take
advantage of all the horse power provided by the optimized FPU.
<P> For old programs or games that do not want to run with the 040 there's
the option to disable the board by pressing the "2" key on the keyboard
while booting, or, even though not documented in the user manual, pressing
the right mouse button. This gives you a real plain A1200 as the board is
disabled completely, that is CPU, RAM and the optional SCSI controller are
all disabled to assure complete compatibility with the outdated programs.
<P> <B>BENCHMARKS</B>
<P> AIBB 6.5 - 020+ optimized code - CP FPU code. All other systems were set
to their maximum (020+ code whenever possible, while FPU is always set to
standard CP whenever possible as the major part of the programs use this
optimization). MAPROM function enabled (ROM in FAST RAM). Comparison base:
stock A1200 no fast.

<P> The HD speed has also increased, seeing SysInfo results, from 1.3MB/sec
to almost 2MB/sec.
<P> As you can see the gfx tests are not that impressive, though I have used
the same mode and depth of the other standard modules provided with AIBB.
The problem is surely due to the slowness of the Chip Ram and the fact that
the board has to synchronize to the motherboard clock before accessing the
chip ram. Nevertheless, the Apollo 1240/40 board is a faster in the gfx
tests and in many other tests, though the module I have seen shows it has
burst mode to fast ram enabled through the installation of two SIMMs.
CPU/Memory latency index is so lowered from 6.1 of the Blizzard to 5.1. I
don't know if it possible to have burst mode with the Blizzard and the SCSI
module which comes with another SIMM socket.
<P> A great boost in graphics performances can be obtained by installing the
FastWaitBlit patch by Dave Jones. Here the gfx tests with the patch running:

</PRE>
<P> <B>LIKES &amp; DISLIKES</B>
<P> Likes: Lots. I like the speed provided by such a fast processor, the
fact that all gfx operations have been accelerated to a decent usable level,
the icon updating that is almost immediate. The SCSI connector for the
optional SCSI controller. The technology used (no visible last second
revisions and modifications). The fact that the chips are mounted upside
down looking toward the ground. The PCMCIA is not disabled (though I could
not test it as I don't have any PCMCIA device). The complete memory
autoconfiguration, though this is now a standard thing even on PC
compatibles. The battery backed clock (that should have been mounted as
standard on the A1200 like in the old A500plus).
<P> Unlike the diffuse thought that the 040 becomes very hot and can almost
be used for warming your bedroom, the fan is able to keep it cool (not warm,
but really cool). Without the fan, however, I have to agree that the chip
becomes very very hot (I have once used it without the fan for some minutes
and when I have touched the top part of the board, just over the CPU
position, it was hot, while the heat sink was just warm).
<P> Very good is the lack of any jumper for configuring the board, but the
MAPROM one. I liked the fact that there's an hardware MAPROM (no pain with
software configurations, ROM files and slow boot) and that the accelerator
board can be completely disabled by pressing the "2" key or the right mouse
button on the keyboard during the boot.
<P> The fact that it is full 060 upgradable.
<P> The SCSI module's relative low cost (considered it supports DMA
transfers till 10MB/sec and comes with a second SIMM socket).
<P> The fact that the chip is not overclocked but works at its native speed.
<P> It's price that is almost equal to that of a 030/50MHz board+FPU but
giving more than twice the speed of that.
<P> Unlike the Apollo A1240/40 card that has chip mounted on the top part of
the board looking toward the inside of the A1200, the Blizzard can be safely
mounted into the original A1200 case provided the computer is kept raised
from the desk and the trapdoor is always left opened to provide the fan with
fresh air. However, the 040 uses lots of power, so the standard 25W power
supply may not be enough to power the board, the ram, the AGA chipset, an HD
and the floppy (and the fan). A more powerful power supply may be required.
<P> Dislikes: Not many, really. The less important is surely the fact that
the fan power connector is not a pass-through type connector and need its
own 4-pin connector. Not a real problem considering the fact that in big
cases where there's a powerful power supply those connectors are abundant.
<P> The board length is also a negative thing as it fits into the trapdoor
with lots of pain, while there are not many cases able to keep a 43cm long
motherboard. I had to cut a piece of my already big desktop to make the
motherboard+accelerator board fit (while the motherboard alone fitted
perfectly).
<P> The single SIMM socket is also a big limitation, but it seems it is now
the standard on all A1200 accelerators cards. However, a second socket comes
together with the good SCSI module.
