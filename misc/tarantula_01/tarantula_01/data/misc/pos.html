<P> Fist of all an explanation why this is in misc, while the ABOX and its
OS descriptions are in the 'news' section. This is not a discrimination, but
the decision I have taken is based on the fact that this is not a news at
all and it is here just for completition of information and to be able to
bring a comparison with the other OSes.
<BR> As said I do not express a particular point of view that is dependent
of someone or something, but just my own, that may or may not be in
agreement with yours. If so you are free to write me and you'll point of
view will be published. See the <A
HREF="../edit/discl.html">disclaimer</A> for further informations.
<P> After having said that, let's start to talk about this OSes that is
being developed by a company, proDAD, that in the past has produced programs
like Adorage, Clarissa and Monument Titler.
<P> First thing to clarify is the fact that phase5 is NOT collaborating with
proDAD for the p-OS project, as reported by an Italian magazine I have read
lately. proDAD is doing all the work, and the results of it is quite
interesting. It will be a new OS very similar to the AmigaOS, with high
(even though not perfect) source code compatibilty with it, no binary
compatibilty, improved features and optimized speed in lots fields.
<P> The binary compatibilty problem is soon solved by the fact that the new
OS can run together with the old one, allowing the user to run "old"
software and the new ones compiled for the p-OS together.
<BR> Source code compatibility is for C/C++ sources and requires just few
modifications of the library function names to be called.
<P> P-OS features preemptive multitasking, multiprocessing (support of more
than a single CPU), will have real RTG, network support integrated in the
OS, will have a rewritten DOS libray that is faster and more efficient, a
new way to build GUIs (similar to the last GUI libraries based on
hyerarchies instead of coordinates), new datatypes, many object will now be
treated as OOP objects (text/graphics/animations and all graphical objects
in general), a partially new intuition library with improved features like
multiple layers in the same window.
<BR> The developer will enjoy new more powerful and professional tools to
debug its programs. Actually, proDAD has put lots of work in this aspect as
its OS, though going to be a good "restyling" and enhancement of the
AmigaOS, does not provide memory protection or resource tracking. That means
that the OS will enjoy much more speed with respect to the concurrent ones,
but will suffer the same problems the AmigaOS has now, that is high
instability not suitable for professional works like net serving (that
requires guarantees on the protection of data between different tasks and
high stability, that is a program that crashes must not bring down the
entire system as it does now with the (in)famous guru alert).
<P> However, the use of memory protection has to be integrated in a good way
if high stability is needed (not like some famous crap OS that try to
protect the data with all the disavantages involved such as high resources
requirements and limitations of the speed and however it crashes at the
first serious problem), and so a choice has to be made: performance based on
the good quality of the applications, or high overhead to protect data that
allow for the use and development of crap programs.
<P> Between the two there is resource tracking able to keep a hystory of
resources allocated by a program and able to release them in case the
program is not able to do it itself (it has crashed or it has stopped
execution for any reason) which requires less resources than memory
protection and can help in some, not too serious, situations.
<P> However, proDAD has opted for the use of nothing to keep control of the
program, a opinable choice that however has its advantages together with
disavantages. Among the advantages there's without doubts the high quality
the programs have to guarantee to work under the OS.
<P> But the disavantages listed above are also some of the reasons that made
phase5 decide not to support such OS for thier A&#092;BOX (see the article
about the <A HREF="../news/aboxos.html">AboxOS</A>).
<P> This OS is then suitable for the current use of our machine as it is
able to bring its OS (now 5 years old) to a new life making it compete with
the "most modern" OS developed lately. But for a serious professional use of
a machine, I would not say that this is the best solution.
<P> proDAD has announced that their OS is going to be available for the 68k
based Amigas, and then they are porting it to the PowerPC and spread also on
other platforms.
<P> For more informations about proDAD's projects look at their WWW pages at
<A HREF="http://www.prodad.de">www.pdodad.de</A>, and to their <A
HREF="epos.html">EpOS program</A> aimed at register develepers of all
categories (PD/shareware/commercial) that will enjoy direct support by the
company with developing tools and news.
