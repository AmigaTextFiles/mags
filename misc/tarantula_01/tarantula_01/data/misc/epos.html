<P> proDAD Software develops the operating system pOS as well as
supplements, procedures and techniques - hereafter referred to as projects
-. In mutual interest and in respect to the mutual co-operation both parties
agree to keep absolute secrecy and mutually respect the copyrights.
<P> The developer agrees not to reproduce or make accessible to third -
neither in full nor in part - any information, material, documents or
projects. The developer further agrees to use the provided material,
documents and projects for internal use only. In addition, developer agrees
to respect and keep any company and business confidentiality and secret.
This is valid especially for any new project.
<P> The developer limits the use of the information and material provided by
proDAD to those employees only who need them to achieve the aims of the
development, the co-operation or the projects. The developer further agrees
to inform all those employees working with the information and material
provided by proDAD, about the present Agreement and on the possible
consequences in case of breach or non-respecting of the stipulations. Upon
request of the developer, a new agreement may be made with proDAD, including
other developers as well.
<P> The Developer agrees to keep any information and material provided by
proDAD in a place inaccessible to third.
<P> The Declaration of Secrecy is valid for a period of 5 years, starting
from the moment when the developer receives a project, information or
material. The obligation to keep secrecy is only suspended if the
information and material concerning the respective project are already
generally known or will subsequently be made known without the developer
being held guilty. The same is valid in case that the developer already
achieved knowledge of it or will subsequently learn about it from other
channels than from proDAD or in case of breach of the obligation of secrecy
by another party or if proDAD gave written approval to make the information
generally known.
<P> proDAD holds all rights on the information or material provided to the
developer. Upon termination of the co-operation with proDAD, the developer
is obliged to return any copies of the information and material provided by
proDAD without further delay. proDAD may as well request the return of such
material any time before termination of the co-operation.

obliged to provide the developer with certain information or material in
future or to include the developer in any future agreement on the purchase
or providing of information, material, goods or services.

extra-contractual liability, from fault on contract of agreement, from
breach of contractual or legal side-duties, from subsequent and/or immediate
damages, as well as from lost income or non-realisation of savings of the
developer are strictly excluded. proDAD may only be sued for liability in
case of deliberate intention or severe negligence, provided no duty has been
infringed whose observance is of special importance to achieve the
contractual target.
<P> This Agreement regulates all legal relation between the developer and
proDAD Software GbR Huber and Burkarth and with it, any previous agreements
made become void. The Agreement may not be transmitted to third without
prior written approval by both parties.
<P> The developer herewith agrees that any unauthorised passing on or use of
the information and material provided will cause severe and long-term
losses. The developer herewith accepts to immediately pay a contractual fine
in case of infringement of any stipulation of the present agreement,
especially of the obligation of secrecy. proDAD reserves the right to claim
further compensation of damages and to make use of any further rights and
legal possibilities in case of infringement.
<P> Place of jurisdiction is the place of business of proDAD.
<P> Further agreements or side-agreements do not exist and are in any case
only valid if made in writing signed by both parties.
<P> In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable
or invalid under applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision,
such unenforceability shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or
invalid as a whole. In such an event, both parties agree that such provision
shall be changed so as to best accomplish the commercial objective of it
within the limits of the applicable law. This Agreement is governed in all
respects by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.
