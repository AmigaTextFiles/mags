<P> Doing a magazine is quite hard and requires lots of time as you have to
hunt for news, first hand on Internet or second hand on various other
magazines, try programs, write articles, draw graphics, edit HTML
documents, test them and still you need some free time to learn something
new on your own.
<P> Moreover, English is not my native language, and I have to correct all
the mistakes, which is not that simple.
<P> So I'm looking for people to help me. I'm not asking them to do
impossible things, just to write some articles of few kilobytes in pure
ASCII standard. Those articles will be transformed into HTML ducuments and
then added to this magazine. I think that would not require more than an
hour for every article, which I think everyone who really want to
collaborate can find in his/her free time (just don't play Worms for an
evening 8) ).
<P> The articles you will send me won't be modyified in any ways, all ideas
and views will be left untouched, I won't censure anything unless they are
offensive. All I will do it's to transform them in a HTML document with the
standard Tarantula's layout ready to be linked in the hypertext.
<P> What I'm looking for are some people who can write articles about
specific fields, such as:
<UL>
<IMG SRC="../../pics/bullets/cya.gif" ALIGN="middle" ALT="o"> hardware reviews (everything is good, starting from reviews
of ypur own accelerator board, gfx card, memory expansion, SCSI interface,
CD-ROM, HD and especially A1200 ZorroII/III backplanes) <P>
<IMG SRC="../../pics/bullets/cya.gif" ALIGN="middle" ALT="o"> software reviews: any is good, PD, shareware or commercial
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../pics/bullets/cya.gif" ALIGN="middle" ALT="o"> programming articles. I would like to have general
programming helps and more related articles on the AmigaOS in general which
will be then seen under the point of view of the various languages like C,
C++, Assemby, BlitzBasic, AmigaE, Oberon, Pascal, Modula2, AMOS or whatever
language one is able to use. <P>
<IMG SRC="../../pics/bullets/cya.gif" ALIGN="middle" ALT="o"> tutorials on specific difficult things that can be done with software like
raytracing programs (Lightwave, Imagine, Real3D but also PovRay, Cinema4D,
RayStorm, World Construction Set) or other complex software to use (maybe a
tutorial on how to use the GCC compiler or even the SAS/C).
</UL>
<P> However, articles which express ideas or personal point of view are
accepted and will be added untouched. Software authors can have their own
space where to announce the release of their program with description of it,
changes with respect to old versions and so on.
<P> I would like to make you notice that this is a free magazine, distributed on
a free media and so there won't be money involved in any way. If you want to
collaborate all you'll get will be your name printed as author of the
articles you'll write.<BR>
The author of the article can hold a copyright on it and the condition that
it can't be modyfied, but must allow me to add the HTML tags. All articles
must be written in English. That's all I require.
<P> Last thing is that I won't change anything of the incoming articles
without the permission of the author, but the author is responsible for
whatever it's written in its own article.
<P> So, if you want to contact me write at: <BR>
