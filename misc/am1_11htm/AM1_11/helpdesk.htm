<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">17-inch Monitor With A500?</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm considering buying a 17" monitor and wonder if I would have any trouble using it with my setup:</P>

<UL>
<LI>A500
<LI>A530 accelerator (030 40Mhz)
<LI>1Meg Chip RAM
<LI>8Meg Fast 32-bit RAM
<LI>FPU
<LI>ICD flicker fixer (supposedly works on any VGA monitor although I'm currently using a Commodore 1942 - it works great in hi-res. no flicker)
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm wondering if with a larger screen, I might get slower refreshes or more flicker. Any ideas?</P>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">Alan Haynes</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">My A500 configuration is quite similar to yours, and I've used it with several monitors of various kinds. The ICD FFV, combined with the Enhanced Chip Set, gives excellent versatility. If the 17" monitor accepts VGA scan rates (and I don't know of any that don't), it should support your deinterlaced high-resolution modes perfectly. The catch is that if it is a VGA-only monitor, it won't support some of your Amiga's modes like the video (~15KHz horizontal scan) ones, or special modes such as Super 72, as opposed to the 1942, which, if I remember correctly, supports all Amiga modes.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Whether a larger screen will affect performance depends upon exactly what you mean by a "larger screen." If you are using the same display modes on different monitors, the refresh speed should be identical, but if you use higher-resolution modes or more overscan to take advantage of the 17-inch monitor's greater size, you may experience a slowdown. In terms of flicker, any modern monitor should support the rates your Amiga is capable of generating, so there should be no problem.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Even in view of how well your A500 should work with a 17-inch monitor, it is best to try the new monitor with the system before you commit, however. There are various factors that could affect the monitor's overall suitability that vary from one unit to the next, and you should check to see just what scan rates it will support just to know how compatible it will be. But it should work just fine.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Bringing an Amiga 2000 Back to Life</H3>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hi!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">My name is Frank and I am (or was) an Amiga user. I had bought one of the A2000's when they first came off the line (Serial #000751). Unfortunately, like you said, Commodore sadly didn't support the machine or promote it the way that they should have so it fell by the wayside. I found it increasingly more and more difficult to find software for it. Unfortunately and sadly I was forced to move to the IBM line of computers. I have never adjusted to IBM's and I repeatedly tell my friends that it is like a second language to me. I have never been able to feel fully comfortable with an IBM even tho I have been using it for a few years.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I have never made any adjustments to my Amiga so I know it must need a few things. I mostly need a new keyboard. Do you know where I can get one? I would love to take it out of mothballs and start using it again. I had no idea that the Amiga community was this active. I figured that the Amiga's reign ended with Commodore's demise in '94. That's when I threw my hands up in disgust and despair. I have taken much teasing from my friends when I tell them that my A2000 could blow the IBM's they use to pieces.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately I never had much to back it up because all Commodore cared about later on was only promoting the Video Toaster line. Is there any way I can get this machine running again? I miss it dearly and I have no idea where to start. Can you help me?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I was amazed when my friends started bragging about IBM's multimedia abilities 2 or 3 years ago. I told them that my Amiga was doing that stuff years before. In fact I was so used to Amiga's Plug 'n' Play that I blew out a card on my IBM trying to get it to work. I can't believe that you have to load drivers on this stupid machine to get things to work. The way I looked at it was that Commodore was handed a gold mine. The Amiga could have easily surpassed IBM on its own territory.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Please respond as I am very excited to see if I can do something with my A2000!</P>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">Thank you very much,<BR>Frank Perri</P>

<B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's great to hear from a one-time Amiga user who's interested in coming back! I have some information that you might find useful.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, the Amiga community has shown tremendous strength and unity for all of the Amiga's years, and particularly in these more difficult, trying times. There was an absolute explosion of reactions, feelings, and ideas when Gateway 2000 bought Amiga Technologies a few months ago.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As an A2000 owner, you're in a fairly good position to rebuild your system. It is highly expandable. I will first list some places where you may be able to find information or Amiga products, and then I'll address some specific issues one by one.</P>


<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Dealers</I></H4>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The following is a list of some of the more prominent or well-known dealers in the Amiga community. A listing is by no means an implied endorsement; this is merely a sampling. Many more can be found online.</P>

<H4 ALIGN="LEFT">Internet Resources</H4>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can probably find your away just about anywhere that is online and is Amiga via some of the following sites.

<UL>
<LI>The Amiga Web Directory, <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/amiga.html">www.cucug.org/amiga.html</A>: A truly vast collection of online Amiga information and resources. 
<LI>amiCrawler, <A HREF="http://www.amicrawler.com">www.amicrawler.com</A>: An Amiga-oriented search engine and database.
<LI>Amiga International, <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">www.amiga.de</A>: The company that IS Amiga.
<LI>Gateway 2000, <A HREF="http://www.gw2k.com">www.gw2k.com</A>: The company that owns Amiga International
<LI>Aminet, <A HREF="http://www.aminet.org/aminet">www.aminet.org/aminet</A> (with many aliases and mirror sites): Possibly the largest single online file collection anywhere, Amiga or not. An ideal place to find Amiga shareware, freeware, and commercial demos.
<LI>Omnipresence, including an Amiga homepage of sorts, <A HREF="http://www.omnipresence.com">www.omnipresence.com</A>: The company that ported Mosaic to the Amiga, the result of which was the Amiga's first graphical browser. Now they develop IBrowse, one of the Amiga's several current high-quality web browsers.
<LI>Usenet: search for newsgroups including the word "Amiga" in their name. There are a number of them, and if you post anything there, you're fairly likely to get a response.
</UL>


<H4 ALIGN="LEFT">Bringing That A2000 Back to Life</H4>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>NOTE: In outlining possible expansion options, I am going to assume a fairly basic system. Some of the items I mention here may be difficult to find; some you may only be able to find in online Classifieds listings. Others, however, should very well be available from dealers.</I></P>

<UL>
<LI><U>New Keyboard</U>: Keyboards are fairly well interchangeable among "box" Amigas like the A2000, A3000(T), and A4000T. The one exception, I believe, is the desktop A4000. You can try any of the dealers mentioned above, and just ask if any given keyboard will work with an A2000.
<LI><U>Operating System</U>: I don't know which version of the AmigaOS you have, but you probably don't have 3.1. This is the latest, and by far best, release of the Amiga system software to date. It is virtually required for running a great deal of modern software, including, in large part, Amiga Internet software. You should be able to find an OS3.1 kit from various dealers for around $100, or thereabouts. Make sure you get the A2000 version, if you do at all.
<LI><U>Memory</U>: You can bump your system up to 2MB chip ram (for screen, graphics, sound data etc.) with the DKB MegAChip. In addition, there are memory cards for the A2000 that will allow up to 8MB Fast RAM (for the CPU). There are other ways to increase memory further as well, as I will outline below.
<LI><U>Display</U>: If you would like to stay with the Amiga's custom chipset for display purposes (which is not a bad idea if you're just getting back into things again), you can upgrade your Denise chip to the SuperDenise, which provides a variety of extra screenmodes, some of them VGA-scan rate. You can deinterlace your existing screenmodes with a display enhancer, of which there are several varieties. The ICD FlickerFreeVideo II board plugs in under your (Super)Denise chip, while the Microway FlickerFixer and other boards like it plugs into the video slot, and does essentially the same thing, upgrading your display to VGA-quality. Keep in mind, though, that if you get a display enhancer, you'll need a monitor capable of displaying VGA video. That means a Commodore 1084(S) is out of the question. The best option is a multiscan, and particularly, one of the monitors sold by Amiga International, as it supports all of an Amiga's display modes.
<LI><U>Graphics Cards</U>: There are several high-end graphics cards available now for the Amiga, should you decide to replace your ECS display. The CyberVision and Picasso IV both offer a great deal of capability. You don't even need to go for that, however. There is an entire generation of Amiga graphics cards that is no longer widely available, and you should be able to find some in various online listings. Any should bring many more colors and higher resolution to your Amiga, and will often work with fairly standard computer monitors.
<LI><U>Accelerators</U>: Anybody making serious use of a 68000-based Amiga these days should consider, if at all possible, buying an accelerator. There are various cards available, everywhere from 68020 to 68060. A 68030 should be enough for running most Amiga software reasonably well, but it won't hurt to go for a 68040 or 68060 if you can get it at a decent price. Coming soon, however, from Phase 5, is a series of PowerPC boards for the Amiga. Included is one for the A2000. They will actually be multiprocessing boards, which means you need a 68030, 68040, or 68060 as a companion processor, as much software is, of course, written for the 680x0. New software, however, will experience a tremendous performance improvement on the PowerPC, which I believe is a 604 at anywhere from 150 to 200MHz. In addition, there will be a high-performance graphics card capable of plugging into the PowerPC board and bypassing the system bus, particularly slow in the case of the A2000's Zorro-II. It can turn the A2000 into an entirely new computer. In addition to a fast processor, just about every accelerator card also includes provisions for expanding memory, often up to 128MB worth, and a fast SCSI interface for high-performance disk access.
<LI><U>Software</U>: Of course, what good is the best computer without software to run on it? There's a fairly good quantity of Amiga software available now for a variety of purposes. Just to name a few, there's Final Writer and Wordworth for word processing and limited desktop publishing, PageStream for full-fledged desktop publishing, Final Data for database work, Final Calc for spreadsheet, ImageFX for image processing, Imagine and Aladdin 4D for graphics rendering, IBrowse, AWeb, and Voyager for web browsing, AmiTCP, Termite TCP, and Miami for connecting to the Internet, DICE and StormC for programming, etc. etc. etc. etc. You can even use PC-Task or PCx for emulating a PC, or ShapeShifter for emulating a Macintosh, all in software. There is plenty out there, and you can find a lot of this from various dealers, or online in demo or shareware form.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For a starting place try Safe Harbor Computers. Talk to them about what you want to do and they should be able to help you out. They have a web site; do a search from Yahoo to find them.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There are MANY more. But they're a good place to start.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">My two cents.</P>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">Greg Noggle<BR>Telecommunications Editor and Hardware Guru</P>

<B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can either order a replacement [keyboard] from any Amiga mail order house (just pick up a print magazine like Amazing Computing and look at the ads) for $75-$80, or you can look for one used in the comp.sys.amiga.marketplace newsgroup, or you can pick up one of the KB-100 IBM to Amiga keyboard adapters for around $40-$50 allowing you to use any IBM keyboard. You can get many peripherals used from people who are selling or from Amiga dealers who sell used hardware. You can get some real bargains on hardware if you keep your eyes open.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We are a hardy bunch. Always seemed like the users and engineers cared more for the machine than the suits at Commodore.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">[The Amiga] Could have [beat IBM], much like OS/2 could have capitalized on Windows 95's lateness and early problems, but didn't and for the same reason. Lack of vision from those holding the wheel.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, welcome back. Hop in...the water's warm...</P>
