<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> Waiter!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Waiter:</B> Hi, my name is Bill and I'll be your Support Waiter. What seems to be the problem?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> There's a fly in my soup!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Waiter:</B> Try again, maybe the fly won't be there this time.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> No, it's still there.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Waiter:</B> Maybe it's the way you're using the soup; try eating it with a fork instead.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> Even when I use the fork, the fly is still there.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Waiter:</B> Maybe the soup is incompatible with the bowl; what kind of bowl are you using?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> A SOUP bowl!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Waiter:</B> Hmmm, that should work. Maybe it's a configuration problem;  how was the bowl set up?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> You brought it to me on a saucer; what has that to do with the fly in my soup?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Waiter:</B> Can you remember everything you did before you noticed the fly in your soup?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> I sat down and ordered the Soup of the Day!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Waiter:</B> Have you considered upgrading to the latest Soup of the Day?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> You have more than one Soup of the Day each day?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Waiter:</B> Yes, the Soup of the Day is changed every hour.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> Well, what is the Soup of the Day now?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Waiter:</B> The current Soup of the Day is tomato.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> Fine. Bring me the tomato soup and the check. I'm running late now.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>[Waiter leaves and returns with another bowl of soup and the check.]</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Waiter:</B> Here you are, Sir. The soup and your check.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> This is potato soup.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Waiter:</B> Yes, the tomato soup wasn't ready yet.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> Well, I'm so hungry now, I'll eat anything.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>[Waiter leaves.]</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Patron:</B> Waiter! There's a gnat in my soup!</P>
