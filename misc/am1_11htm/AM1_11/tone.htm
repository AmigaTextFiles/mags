<P ALIGN="LEFT">Not too much I can say. This month has left me with very limited time. Unfortunate since we have so many new programs to look at. From new versions of STFax, MultiCX and more on Aminet to new releases from commercial developers like Sadeness including AGA Experience Volume 3, Hidden Truths (a multiplatform CD-ROM) and Foundation (a Settlers/Warcraft like game in development) to review. These will be brought to you next month along with all that you need to make your net journeys with your Amiga more meaningful.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">See you all next month and sorry for the brevity of this months Tone Byte. All will be made up for next month.</P>
