<P ALIGN="LEFT">We all got used to it. In 30 days the answer will come. In two weeks the situation will be clarified. By April 1st we will know what the future holds. For several years there were critical Amiga dates circled on our calendars. Someone in the newsgroups posed a theory called the "fortnight syndrome" that resurrection always seemed to be two weeks away.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now that the situation has been clarified, I am confused. There is no date circled on my calendar and I don't really know what we are waiting for this time. Come on Gateway, give us a date for something. Anything!</P>
