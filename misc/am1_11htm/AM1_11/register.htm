<HR>

Send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM">MikeWebb@CompuServe.COM</A> with "Register AM Mirror" as the subject, and specify the following information:

<UL>
<LI>A precise URL to be listed as the mirror site
<LI>An e-mail address to which new issues of AM can be sent, and with which we can communicate with you
<LI>A short description of the site
<LI>The format(s) you will be carrying (HTML online, AmigaGuide online, HTML LhA, HTML ZIP, AmigaGuide LhA)
<LI>Whether you will keep archives of old issues available
<LI>A country or general geographic location of the server supplying your site
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">That's it! If we register your site as an official mirror site, you get a listing in the mirrors.htm file that comes with every issue, and eventually on The Webb Site itself. Thank you for supporting The Amiga Monitor.</P>
