<P ALIGN="LEFT">Greetings, everybody, and welcome to a new-and-improved AM.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">That's right, this issue's a little late, but there are some good reasons for that. I have done some restructuring of the general layout, and added "return to index" links at the bottoms of all sub-pages (something somebody suggested a long time ago, and I just now got around to implementing). But the big deal is something completely new, called AM Link Redirection.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I give a more complete explanation in the item in the index at left, but to put it simply, AM Link Redirection is a system by which up-to-date e-mail and web addresses are provided even to people reading older issues (which in the past were prone to containing outdated contact information). Together with the newly-updated <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amhome.html">AM Home Site</A>, <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MikeWebb/amlinks.html">The AM Link Redirection Page</A> is now online, and by writing this editorial, I am officially releasing it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">For this issue, I would like to draw your attention to a special feature a good-sized portion of the AM Staff has helped to put together. It's called "Best of Amiga," and it is about each staff member's picks for the top Amiga products of all time. I particularly enjoyed doing the editing on this one, as well as writing my own "memoirs" (for the older products, anyway), and I think it will prove interesting. Finally, once again, we are running a survey about America Online and the Amiga platform in which we would like as many people as possible to participate. For more information, see the pertinent items in the Table of Contents below.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">But that's all for now. So welcome to the March 1998 issue of The Amiga Monitor, our second consecutive one-month issue.</P>

Always insightful, Sam Ormes takes his monthly look into the Amiga Crystal Ball, this time at a new Amiga-oriented service. It sounds promising, but it makes lofty claims. Can it live up to them?

You've seen the editorials. Now it's your turn to offer your opinions on this subject. Should America Online be made available to Amiga users? Would Amiga users benefit, or even want to use AOL? Every vote counts, so if you have an opinion, please take a look at this survey!

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Introduction by Michael Webb:</I></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Among all members of the AM Staff, there are many years of Amiga experience. During out time with this platform, we have seen many different Amiga products of all kinds come and go. Recently, I thought it would be interesting if the staff looked back through the years and picked out those products which impressed them the most.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">What you'll see below, then, is a discussion from various staff members of their all-time favorite Amiga products. This is no "Best of 1997" series, nor even "Best of 1990's"; it is, as the name says, "Best of Amiga."</P>

<A HREF="mp3.htm">MP3 Shootout</A><BR>
<B><I>By Steve Duff</I></B><BR>
MPEG3 files are becoming a popular means of storing real song data. Due to the compression involved, however, they require a fast CPU in order to play well, and like any new technology, they're a little slow in coming to the Amiga. But they are now here. Steve Duff takes a look at how some current and emerging Amiga MP3 players do when compared to more "mainstream" other-platform players.<BR>
