are a new Italian development team that have currently no less than 4 Amiga 
games in development.<p>
The first of these is Escape Towards the Unknown.  This is described as a
graphic adventure in the Monkey Island style.  Hurricane intend to make four
different versions of this game, one for 680x0 machines, a PPC version, a P-OS
version and Graphics Card version.  It is set for a February 1998 release.<p>
The second of their games is a football game.  The game is called Eat the
Whistle, quite an odd name I'm sure you'll agree.  Anyway, it is looking pretty
good and since we haven't had a decent footy game since Sensible Soccer could be
just the thing we need.  While on the subject of Sensible Soccer this game is
being touted by the programmers as being much better, I guess we'll have to wait
to find out.<P>

The other two games that they are developing are at a very early stage and
details on them are scarse.  Obviously, as soon as I hear anything about them, it
will be appear here.<P>
But as for the future, well, the team are not too sure if to support the 68060 CPU
or to go PPC, their decision will be made depending on how well the PowerPC
is and if Amiga International uses PowerPC processors for their new Amigas no 
doubt.<P>
