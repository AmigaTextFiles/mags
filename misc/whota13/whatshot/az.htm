welcome letter and a list of CD titles from which you can choose your free
gift.

<P>To join, just phone 1-800-509-9322 and say "AmigaZone Sent Me!" or visit
<A HREF="http://www.calweb.com">CalWeb's page</a> and select the new 
user

operating system, and enter "<b>AmigaZone Sent Me!</b>" in the "other"
box.  <i>(The $20 signup fee will be waived!) </i>

<P>Upon notification of your signup, the AmigaZone will ship you a free CD of
your choice - choose from many CD titles by Graphic Detail and Fred Fish!

<P><i>Offer good while supply lasts</i>

<P>AmigaZone has been online, serving the needs of Amiga owners since 1985.

<P>Members can telnet into our text-style interface, or use our slick, fast
Web interface, our members-only FTP site, and our POP3 email server to
access over 40,000 Amiga files, (including thousands of files you won't
find on Aminet or anywhere else!) 40,000 articles in Amiga Usenet
newsgroups, Amiga Fidonet newsgroups, over a dozen popular Amiga mailing
lists, participate in our live, nightly chats and join our Sunday chat
where we give away even MORE free stuff every week!

<P>$19.95 a month (billed to your credit card or invoiced in the mail)
gets you unlimited 24/7 access to everything in the Zone, plus your own
CalWeb shell account with 10 meg of storage (for your own personal Web
site).

<P>We also offer a totally free, two-week trial account (limited to 120
minutes of usage per day) to try us out.  (The free CD gift applies only
to new, paid signups, whether or not you use the two-week trial account
first).
