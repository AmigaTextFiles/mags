<P>
The date is fast approaching for the <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/tower-
bin/cucug-ad-mae.pl">2nd annual Midwest Amiga
Exposition</a>.  If you're planning on being there and didn't get advanced
tickets, no need to worry, we will have plenty at the door for $15.00
each.  The tickets are good for both Saturday and Sunday, and kids 12 and
under are admitted free!

<P>The dates and times once again are: Saturday, Nov 1st 10:00am to 6:00pm, 
and
Sunday 10:00am to 2:30pm.  It's being held at the Concourse Hotel at the
<A HREF="http://www.port-columbus.com/">Port Columbus airport</a>.  For 
directions and schedule information, please
<A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/tower-bin/cucug-ad-mae.pl">visit our 
website</a>.

<P>Don't miss out on meeting Petro Tyschtschenko, President
Amiga International, Representatives from Amiga Inc, and other great
Amiga celebs like Dale Larson, Andy Finkel, Jason Compton, and many more.

<P>Door prizes, hourly give-aways, the Amiga Developers Conference,
educational seminars, and the great people who make the Amiga more than
just a great computer, make this one of the most dynamic events of the year!

<P>We have an impressive array of vendors and user groups, over twice as
many as last year.  Many newer Amiga companies will be exhibiting their
wares along with a number of long-time Amiga supporters.  For a complete
list of exhibitors, <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/tower-bin/cucug-ad-
mae.pl">visit our website</a>.

<P>Since our announcement of this year's show, the response from the Amiga
community has been amazing!  We've been flooded with requests and
questions about the event, but more than anything, we've seen
positive and dedicated response for supporting this event from vendors
to individuals.

<P>Many, many thanks go to the Amiga community for their help, support, and
upcoming attendance of our show.

<P>We look forward to seeing each and every one of you there!

<P>Sincerely,

<P>David Pearce<br>
