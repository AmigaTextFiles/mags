in the UK who have two games in development.

<br>
<img src=images/radio01.gif alt="Radioaction" align=right>The first is called 
Radioaction and is an Pseudo-3D blaster in the Super-Stardust mould, it's based 
around the frantic action tunnel bits.  You will battle against the Alien menace 
through 11 varying levels, each with unique rendered GFX and enemies.  The type 
of sections will include Nuclear Bunkers, Sunken Palaces, Hyperspace, and the final 
battle on the Alien's Homeworld.

<img src=images/mart00.gif alt="Martian Tales" align=right>The second game 
in development is called Martian Tales an Warcraft II inspired strategy game.
<br>
<br>
<img src=images/mart02.gif alt="Martian Tales" align=left>Details are light but 
it will feature Limited intelligence (eg. fear), the ability to mine the three substances 
found on Mars (Fungus, Lichen + Stone), 2 Sides with very different trooptypes - 
the evil Greys vs. the innocent Smeglings, different landscapes, many Building 
types, with Warcraft II inspired resource management and battles.

The screenshots of Martian Tales and Radioaction appears to show that they have 
included plenty of detail and they have said that they will be concentrating on what 
makes a game good - Gameplay.  Currently they have no Publishers, so if you're in 
the business get in contact with them.
