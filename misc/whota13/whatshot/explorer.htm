The following article contains the latest information on Explorer 2260 which will be 
coming from the World Foundry early next year, so if you interested read on.
<p>
<H2><Font color=#0099FF>Game Information</Font></H2><P>
Explorer2260 is the future. It combines the elements of space simulations
which have gone before it, ranging from Elite, Frontier through Privateer
and beyond, and adds more strategy, experiences and options set in
a universe which changes around the player as the game progresses.<P>
<H2><Font color=#0099FF>Feature List</Font></H2><P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT color=#FF9900>The Dynamic Universe Model:</FONT><BR>
Throw out the old methods of the static or linear game engine, the dynamic
universe model in Explorer2260 is a completely new concept on the Amiga which
removes the predictability from games. Borders change, wars are won and lost,
races rise and fall. The only thing you can be sure about is that you can't be
sure about anything anymore.<P>

<LI><FONT color=#FF9900>StarNET:</FONT><BR>
<I>'To a million worlds on a hundred thousand systems, One 
Network'.</I><BR>
This is the Internet of the future; a galaxy spanning web of computers
talking to each other across the depths of space. Everything that
happens in the universe will appear on the news channels, you can
apply for jobs, or even advertise to employ someone else. Places to sell,
buy or just look at lurk in it's corners.<P>

<LI><FONT color=#FF9900>Hyperspace:</FONT><BR>
This is not the 'hit the jump button, flash, you are at your
destination' hyperspace prevelant in many games of the genre. Here you
enter hyperspace through wormholes called jumppoints created by your
ship engines, or special jump vortex generators call Jumpgates. Hyperspace
is a new dimension where you can travel the massive distances between
stars, but here even battles can be fought. Beware though; hyperspace
is a dangerous place with punishing energy drains, gravity wells almost
as strong as black holes, vicious hyperspace storms which can destroy
ships in a blink of the eye and something else is out there......<P>

<LI><FONT color=#FF9900>Stations:</FONT><BR>
Space stations and docking ports will be much more complex than in other space
games. There will be no animation sequence as the ship is brought into dock: the
ships will actually be moved around inside the station. The player will have a
large selection of actions available via a 3D representation of the station
giving access to shops, accommodation, security services, StarNET links and many
other options..... Stations will expand or deteriorate depending upon their
popularity and location, some are military outposts some are corporate
holdings.<P>

<LI><FONT color=#FF9900>Fleets:</FONT><BR>
If there is a major failing in many games it is that ships are uncoordinated and
often travel alone (especially in Frontier and it's fellows). Explorer2260 has a
special clause in it's ship intelligence routines which will allow ships to form
into coordinated fleets allowing large attack forces, or convoys and escorts or
pirate bands.<P>

<LI><FONT color=#FF9900>Music:</FONT><BR>
The music in explorer will utilise surroundsound mixing techniques to produce
high quality music unheard of in many games without direct CD-audio playback.
Thanks to the routines developed by Jarno Paananen I will be using s3m and xm
modules extensively throughout the game. The sound effects will be played using
the AHI device to provide better quality sound than the standard audio.device as
well as giving support for soundboards and future enhancement of the Amiga
audio.<P>

<LI><FONT color=#FF9900>The 3D engine:</FONT><BR>
Fully texturemapped, lightsourced and shaded the engine will include features
such as fog and lense flares. The 68K version will be cut down but a PPC version
will be able to include a virtual cockpit and other features impossible to
achieve on 68K processors.<P>

<H2><Font color=#0099FF>System Requirements</Font></H2><P>
The requirement for Explorer are under review but it is becoming increasingly
likely that a PPC version will be produced before a 68K version to allow many
of the more complex features (especially within the 3D engine) to be
implemented. My personal preference is strongly PPC given the current news
from Phase 5 (and lack of news from Gateway). Other requirements will be:
CD drive (4x minimum, although 2x will work but will result in slower loading)
HD drive required to save custom setups, games, stats and user defines ships,
races, goods and maps. Min 8Mb memory free, GFX card recommended but not
necessary. The game will be 100% system friendly and will multitask.<P>
