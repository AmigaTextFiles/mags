The following article is from the News Section at Amiga Flame.

Developing Games For The Amiga</A> article, Skillo Interactive are a new 
Development Team who will be bringing two games, Radioaction and Martian Tales 
but it seems that they also have another game in development.
<br>
This game is called, KRUD TV and although I have no other details except the 
name, I have been told they are desperately looking for a artist as the other artists 
are busy on Radioaction and Martian Tales.
<br>
<br>
The brief is to draw around 100 icons depicting companies to advertise on KRUD 
TV, and stars, and the programmes themselves. So if any Amiga Flame reader is 
interested in earning themselves a third of the royalties from KRUD TV, send an 
example of their 2D, cartoon-esque work to the e-mail address below and they will 
inform you before the end of November if they have the job.
<br>
<br>
Please don't anyone start drawing straight away, because the task is very specific, 
right down to the palette you must use.  I hope that someone out there can help 
Skillo Interactive and I hope that Amiga Flame readers could spread this message 
out.
<br>
<br>
They can also help anyone who needs a MOD for their game, be it commerical, 
shareware or whatever, and they will sort you out with a brand new, commercial-
quality MOD in any style you want.
