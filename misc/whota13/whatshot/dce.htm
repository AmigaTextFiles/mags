Langen/Oberhausen, Germany, October 24th, 1997 - Following on from <A 
HREF="http://www.amiga.de/">AMIGA
International's</a> recent announcements about an open licensing policy for the
Amiga, an agreement has been reached which licenses <A 
HREF="http://www.dcecom.de/html/index.html">DCE Computer Service 
GmbH</A>
to manufacture and distribute its own range of Amiga motherboards and
computers.

<P>DCE Computer Service GmbH, based in Oberhausen, Germany, have 
developed a new advanced
board based on Amiga A4000, on the Amiga Chip Set and the OS 3.1. The 
agreement with AMIGA International, Inc. allows the use of
the Amiga OS 3.1, supply agreements on Amiga proprietary chips and the use of
the "powered by Amiga" logo on all its products.

<P>"As promised we continue an open license policy, to broadening our Amiga
market. DCE Computer Service GmbH is well known in Europe for advanced
technology developments. This new developed board in standard ATX, with a
modular system, MPEG, ZORRO 2/3 is another milestone for the future of our
Amiga technology", said Petro Tyschtschenko, President of AMIGA
International, Inc. in Langen, Germany.

<P>Mr. Thomas Dellert, Managing Director of DCE Computer Service GmbH, "I
believe that this new board development based on Motorola CPU 68030/50 MHZ
and 68060/50MHZ; 64 MB/128MB Ram, a standard PC Keyboard, 1.44 MB floppy
disk, 1.7 GB IDE HDD, 10 - 24 speed IDE CD Rom, AGA Chip Set, scan doubler
and HF modulator optional BU LD in an standard ATX comfort tower case is one
of the steps for Amiga to be back for the future."

<P><b>About DCE Computer Service GmbH</b>

<P>DCE Computer Service GmbH was founded 1987 in Oberhausen, Germany. 
The
service company is wholly owned by Thomas Dellert. The company started as a
service shop for wholesale dealer and consumer markets. Since now the company
became one of the leading available Amiga repair shops. In 1993 DCE was
nominated to the European  Amiga Repair Service Centre by Commodore. Since
that time DCE is in charge of the Amiga Service. Since 1995 DCE is working on
developments and productions to make the Amiga expansible. DCE's standard of
performance is underpinned by an own production line of the highest standard
of production engineering to create omplex sophisticated conductive plates.
Several successful tests in Amiga Magazines have furnished the proof of high
efficiency of the goods produced by DCE. The consequent development of their
own products underlines the position of DCE as an innovative company, which
has the opinion that a successful future can only be achieved by the
permanent seek of the optimum and by market adaptation of their own products.
Currently DCE has 12 employees, and it is one of DCE's fundamental policy to
support them with further technical education.<BR><BR>
