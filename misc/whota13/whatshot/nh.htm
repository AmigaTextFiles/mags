New Horizons is a new Space Station Management Simulation which was briefly 
mentioned a few weeks ago and here are the first screenshots and background to 
this game.
<br>
<br>
The game will be set in the year 2209, Earth is venturing further and
further into the stars, it is a new beginning for mankind. You play
the part of either a military officer, corperate executive or
independant citizen (each with advantages/ disadvantages), who is put
in charge of/ builds a Space Station.
<br>
<br>
You will be able to hire and fire staff, upgrade the station, even
have some creative input in the design of the station. Once you "Open"
your station ship will begin to visit, you set docking fees, rent,
taxes and declare which goods are prohibited.
<p>
You will have to deal with Mutant Raiders, Unruly occupants, alien
ambassadors, incoming traffic, and of course the odd unusual swirly
thing which decides to open up near your station.
<p>
You will be able to take control in combat and emergency situations
and do a host of other things including taking your station on a
joyride round the solar system...
<br>
<br>
New Horizons will be set in the The World Foundry Universe and will have many 
features which are listed below:-
<br>
Upon starting the game you will be presented with an option detailing the level of 
play:
<br>
<br>
Corperate level: You get loads of £££, but don't get much supplied to you. 
<br>
Military Level: Little freedom and cash, but get free fighters etc. 
<br>
Freelance: Little ££, no equipment... 
<br>
<br>
<img src=images/nh03.gif alt="New Horizon" WIDTH=203 HEIGHT=249 
align=right>You would start by selecting a star system. Earth, etc. has a lot of 
competition so it would be harder. An isolated system/unexplored has little 
competition. You start with a ground colony constructor or a space station. You 
decide its location and which planet... You have a limited amount of funds and you 
have to make the space station a sucess...
<br>
<br>
You can help design the station or you can choose between several basic structures 
depending on your race. After 6 months the space staion/ground base is completed 
and you begin..... You would have options to rent out areas to shops, businesses 
etc. You have control over docking fees and room prices. Once you declare the 
station operational the fun begins.......
<br>
<br>
You will be able to :
<br>
<br>
- Check on the competiton, ie. fees, facilities etc.
<br>
- Declare independance from governent/ Defect to opposing side
<br>
- Get involved with illegal trading, ie. purchase small station on the rim and use it 
as a front for illeagal doings......
<br>
- Own many stations
<br>
- Expand space and ground based stations
<br>
- Arm station and build a fleet to defend the station
<br>
- Meet with alien ambassadors
<br>
- Sabotage other stations, by blockadeing, bombing or sabotageing facilities/ 
docking bays
<br>
- manage air traffic
<br>
- be affected by wars, ie. blockades, attacks...
<br>
- setup a station BBS/web page with ads etc...
<br>

<br>
<br>
The graphics will be like the TFX weapon select screen, where a 3D texture mapped 
model of the station is shown, it will then cutaway to various areas.
