Directory.

<i>We received the following note from Petro
Tyschtschenko, President, AMIGA International, Inc. about the upcoming
ZKM Internet Media Party. Credit for the promotion of this event in
the Amiga community also goes to Lamar Morgan President, Amiga
Atlanta, Inc. who first alerted us to this event. It sounds
interesting and has the interest of Amiga Technologies, too, so check
it out!

<P>Dear Kevin,

<P>I encourage all Amigians to check out a most extraordinary event - the <A 
HREF="http://www.zkm.de/">ZKM
Internet Media Party</a>. It takes place Saturday, Oct.18th for 24 hours - on the
Internet and at 150 Goethe-Instituts throughout the world.
The ZKM/Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany is the word`s first
institution dedicated purely to art in relation to the new media. The ZKM
encompasses a Media Museum, a Museum of Contemporary Art, a Mediathek, an
Institute for Visual Media, and Institute for Music and Acoustics, and a
Media Theatre. For its opening on October 18th, the ZKM is planning a big
party, and the <A HREF="http://www.goethe.de//uk/atl/">Goethe-Institut 
Atlanta</a>, together with Atlanta artists, will
join them live on the Internet. Art projects on the Internet will include
Jochen Gerz`s "Berkeley Oracle" and Lynn Herschman`s virtual version of the
new museum in Karlsruhe.

<P>Although this is not an AMIGA-specific event, it was members of the <A 
HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~amigaatl/">AMIGA
Atlanta User Group (AAi)</a> and user from the AMIGA Karlsruhe University that 
set up
the computer systems and helped make the connectivity between the
Goethe-Institut Atlanta and the ZKM Center in Karlsruhe possible.
Several members of our German AMIGA community will join the party.

<P>Believe me, this is one party you should not miss - either by connecting to
ZKM`s website or by visiting one of the 150 Goethe-Instituts throughout the
world on Saturday, October 18th. Remember, this is the first such event of
it`s kind in the world - and Amigians are involved to make it happen.

<P>For more information on this extraordinary event, please visit the ZKM
homepage (<A HREF="http://www.zkm.de/">http://www.zkm.de/</a>)

<P>I appreciate your support.

<P>Best regards

<P>Petro Tyschtschenko
