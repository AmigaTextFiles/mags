Hi,
<p>
This is the third editorial for the What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine, and a lot 
has happened again since the release of the second issue, as an on-line version of 
What's Hot On The Amiga Magazine is now available at <A 
HREF="http://www.koyote.com/users/jbb/whota/main.htm">http://www.koyote.com/
users/jbb/whota/main.htm</A> and many thanks for the web space which was 
donated by <A HREF="mailto:BCo@airvideo.net">BCo</A>.  Hopefully, this site 
will be updated at least once a week.
<p>
This issue contains a lot of articles on the Phase 5 and the Haage & Partner 
WarpUp dispute which has dragged on for almost all of this October.  But, there is 
a still 
of other news out there, with the collection of articles split more or less evenly by 
game news and the more serious stuff.  But, in this issue, there are a couple of 
exclusives such as the <A HREF="explorer.htm">Latest On Explorer</A>, <A 
HREF="nse.htm">Nova Sector Engineering's New Amiga Compatible 
Computers</A>, <A HREF="fs.htm">Foundation Screenshots</A> and <A 
HREF="yam.htm">YAM 2.0</A> articles.
<P>
A number of new sites have made their way into <A HREF="links.htm">Links</A>, since the last issue and are all worth a look.
<P>
Now this month's, Site Of The Month is <A 
HREF="http://www.amigaflame.co.uk">Amiga Flame</A>, who have just recently 
move their UK mirror to a new server and in the process, Amiga Flame has 
undergone a number of changes.  Amiga Flame is one of the best site for finding 
the latest news on Amiga games and is definitely one site to keep going to on a 
regular basis. 
<p>
In the next issue, there will be a number of articles on more games, along with 
other stuff, and maybe something on the MidWest Amiga Exposition.
<P>
Before, I end this issue's editorial, I'm still accepting anymore offers of free web 
space as I'd like to have a mirror site as well, if you have any, then e-mail me at:

See you,
