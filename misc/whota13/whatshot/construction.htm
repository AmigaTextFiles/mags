<FONT SIZE="6">C</FONT>onstruction is a new game from a programming
team called 'The Hidden'. They have been around on the Amiga scene for a very
long time developing games such as Donk and were working on The Big End and 
The
Hidden Golf to name just two. Recently, however, they have been very quiet and
nothing has been heard about these or any of there other games. However, things
have now changed and I have been told that they are still writing a number of
games for the Amiga, of which Construction is one.<P>

Construction a platform game (something which we don't get much of these days)
with some very colourful and well drawn graphics.

HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"> The game contains a very big puzzle element. You 
take
the part of two builders (more on this later) called Sharkey and Snork who have
to build urrmm, buildings :). The aim of each level is to complete a certain
percentage of the building without getting killed.<P>

The gameplay is kinda similar to tetris in a way.  Whilst dodging the nasties on
each level you have to finish off the building, for each part you do you get
cash, however, everytime you get hit by the nasties you loose some cash, all you
have to do it break even at the end of the level, if you don't then you have to
play it again.  It all sounds kinda complicated but when you understand it, it
is a very nice idea.<P>

Going back to the mention of taking the part of two builders, well, this is
where the fun begins.  The game is designed as a two player game with each
player taking the part of one builder, it takes real teamwork to complete each
of the levels.  However, one player can play by thereself as the other player
will run using its own unique personality controlled by the computer.<P>

The game will run on any ECS Amiga With at least 1Mb Chip RAM.  This may 
sound a bit low spec by todays standards, but don't let this fool you into thinking
the game is not any good.<P>

More news on this and any more of The Hidden's games as soon as I get it.
