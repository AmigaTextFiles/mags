<b>Press Release:</b>

<P>We know you`re not stupid. We know that you turned off when
Bluey posted a message saying that he would not be
continuing as Editor of <A HREF="http://amigaworld.com/thelair/">The 
Lair!</a> And we know that you haven`t
come back yet. We have stat counters for this kind of thing

<P>But fear not: we`re back now!
New editor Chris Hanretty and Erik Elgersma have now kind of
taken over, and we aim to reinstall The Lair as the best Amiga
e-zine around.

<P>So, this month, The Lair is back with a bang, featuring not
only the
latest news concerning Amiga Inc., but also views and opinions from
respected people in the Amiga community. We have interviews with
NewIcons author Eric Sauvageau, and Jeret Lendman, co-owner of the
latest Amiga clone manufacturers Nova Sector Engineering, not
forgetting ofcourse a number of great articles concerning the future
of the Amiga, the latest episode of "The Day The Music Died", and
the first article of a whole new series checking out the Aminet.

<P>We analyse the latest news from the mouth of Amiga Inc., and look
at the blow up between Phase 5 and Haage and Partner

<P>There's definitely something there for everyone this month,
so why
not check us out at http://amigaworld.com/thelair/. No subscription
is necessary, we are free for all to read and enjoy. The latest
issue is out now!

<P>And remember: we know who your ISP is.....

<P>Yours sincerely,

<P>Chris Hanretty,  aka Obscure Reference<br>
and <br>
Erik Elgersma, aka Elgersma<br>

<P><A 
HREF="http://amigaworld.com/thelair/">http://amigaworld.com/thelair/</A> The 
Lair! - the definitive Amiga  e-zine.<br>
But you already knew that.
