<p><H2>CUCUG Announces New Mirror Site in the United Kingdom</H2>

<P>October 30, 1997 - The <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/"
>Champaign-Urbana Computer Users Group (CUCUG)</A> announced today
that <A HREF="http://www.ukonline.com.uk/">UK Online</A>, Britain's
leading family-oriented Internet Service Provider, would be hosting
its popular World Wide Web site. UK Online joins a coalition that now
includes six active Internet service providers worldwide which are
hosting the Central Illinois user group's site.

<P>A process known as &quot;mirroring&quot; makes a nearly identical
copy of a Web site available to users closer to their own connection
on the Internet. This usually results in more reliable connects and
faster response.

<P>Other CUCUG mirrors are currently located in Australia, Italy,
Greece and Poland. The primary CUCUG site is maintained at Champaign,
Illinois in the United States.

<P>UK Online representative Matt Heathcote said, "CUCUG has been one
of my most used sites since I found it over a year ago.  I check it
every day for the new links and latest news. It is the most
comprehensive Amiga site I have found to date. I personally wanted it
on our servers because it will supply our users with very fast access
to the latest news and links without having to look to America or
Europe to supply it over the ever busy Internet. Having it here will
ensure optimum download times for our users."

<P>In terms of the Amiga scene in the UK, Heathcote added, "We have
quite a large base of Amiga users in the UK.  Most of them started
with 500s and upgraded to a 1200. These 1200s have been upgraded
and upgraded to meet the demands of the users. The 4000 is not such a
common machine as it is in the States purely because of its cost.
Most users use their machines for 3D or graphics and accessing the
Internet more as a hobby than anything else.  We don't have the level
of professional users that the States has. The Amiga over here is
kept alive by enthusiastic hobbyists."

<P>The founder of UK Online, Tim King, was reportedly responsible for
the first version of Amiga OS. According to Heathcote, King took the
portable OS from Cambridge University (TriPOS) and ported it to the
Amiga and that was what was used by the original Amiga team in
Silicon Valley years ago.

<P>CUCUG maintains the award-winning <A HREF="../../amiga.html">Amiga
Web Directory</a> and <A HREF="../../agnes.html">Agnes</a>, an
advanced Amiga WWW search utility. Both have become very popular with
Amiga users throughout the world.

<P>The address for the new CUCUG mirror site in the UK is:
