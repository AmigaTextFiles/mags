<CENTER><H2>Game Rumours</H2></CENTER>
<P>
There are many rumours of new games coming to the Amiga soon, one being a 
Tomb Raider type of game which is currently in devlopment for the Amiga.  The 
game will be 040+ only and will feature some spectacular graphics.
<p>
Alos I've heard that Monkey Island 3 will be coming to the Amiga from none other 
than LucasArts themselves, but only being available for PPC Amigas.
<p>
There are also rumours of a PPC only Quake clone being coded, and also there are 
a lot of rumours flying regarding clickBOOM's next game, which could be a new 
game or another port.  More will appear on these rumours as soon as I find out 
more.

<P>
First off Trapped 2, has been released.  This excellent looking 3D game has gone 
down quite well and was awarded 92% by the UK magazine, CU Amiga.
<P>
For those of you interested in the Diversia Demo, which I mentioned in previous 
articles and are awaiting it's release, well it would seem your going to have to wait 
a little longer, the demo has been released, but to publishers only.  There will not 
be a public version released until just before the actual games release in December
'97/January '98.
<p>
Another Command & Conquer clone, Forgotten Forever has so far had the 
pathfinder finished (One of the difficult parts of the game) and the programmers 
are now working on re-coding the game to C from Assembler, so to make it easier 
to port.  There is no word as yet on a release date for the demo or the game.
<P>
A few Vulcan games should be coming our way soon.  Uropa 2, Wasted Dreams &
Final Odyssey are all very nearly ready for release, hopefully all three will be
released very soon, Uropa2 and Final Odyssey are set for a November 1st
release.

During the course of the past month the Italian Amiga Flame Mirror has been

<CENTER><H2>The World Foundry Sign to Vulcan</H2></CENTER>
<P>
It's offical, the signing of The World Foundry by Vulcan.  Below is the press release 
from Vulcan:-<P>
<UL>
<B>
Vulcan Software Ltd is proud to announce the signing of The World
Foundry.<P>

Vulcan has signed The World Foundry in it's entirety and will be
publishing all World Foundry titles under the Vulcan Software banner,
beginning with Explorer2260 and Maim & Mangle.  <P>

The World Foundry was formed in September of this year from Digital
Anarchy Software, Deimos Design and Intuition Software with the
intention of pooling knowledge and resources to develop high
specification Amiga titles. Vulcan has been in talks with all the
members of The World Foundry for some time and are very excited about
the prospect of adding their talents and commitment to our organisation.
The World Foundry is a welcome addition to `The Vulcan Army' which
already consists of some 14 development teams and over 100 skilled
individuals.  <P>

The primary aim of The World Foundry is to develop high quality, high
specification games for the Amiga market which will take full advantage
of expanded Amigas and PPC equipped machines. This concentration on
higher spec Amigas falls in perfectly with Vulcan's current drive to
push the Amiga forward. Vulcan and all it's developers have made a
commitment to the Amiga and the Amiga Community, through our combined
efforts and enthusiasm we can help shape the future, a future which is
starting to look very bright indeed. <P>
</UL>

Very good news indeed.  It would seem there is no limit on how many games 
Vulcan
will sign up, the future looks brighter by the day.<P>
