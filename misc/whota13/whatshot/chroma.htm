<P>Sony has recently announced the release of two revolutionary
disk-based digital cameras.  Both machines have a built-in
floppy disk drive (PC HD format) on which photos are stored.
As many Amiga systems now incorporate HD drives which can read
PC 1.44Mb disks, the world of digital stills photography is
now open to the Amiga world. Use on other platforms (PC, Mac etc.)
is also possible.

<P>The <A 
HREF="http://members.aol.com/chromanet/mavica.html">MAVICA</a> FD5 
boasts an auto exposure fixed-focus f-4.8, f-2.0 lens,
equivalent to a 35mm focal length of f-47mm.

<P>The MAVICA FD7 features auto exposure with 5 mode settings,
auto / manual focus and an f-4.8 to f-1.8 lens (35mm lens equivalent
focal length f-40 to f-400mm). Features also include a 10-1 optical
zoom and 4 built-in image effects (sepia, mono, neg & pastel).

<P>The cameras store 24-bit colour images (max res 640 x 480) in JPEG format,
ideal for web page graphics, video backdrops and desktop publishing.
Up to 40 images can be stored per disk in low res.  Image preview is
via a rear-mounted LCD panel.

<P>Accessories supplied with both models: Rechargeable battery, charger,
handstrap, backup memory battery (optional for the FD7 are a wide-angle
and a telephoto lens).

<P><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/chromanet/index.html">Chroma</a> 
will be supplying the cameras with both PC and Amiga software.
