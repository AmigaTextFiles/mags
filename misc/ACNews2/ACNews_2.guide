@{FG Shine}Welcome to @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}@{FG Text}

Hello and welcome to the 2nd issue of @{B}AmiChannel News@{UB}.

I  am  fed  up  with people making promises which can not be fulfilled. The last
straw  that  breaks  the camel's back has been the just held @{B}Amiwest@{UB}. The people
behind the show made a lot of announcemnent promoting their show. They failed to
fullfill most they promised.

They stated that all the staff of @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB} would attend the show. Neither @{I}Jeff
Schindler @{UI} nor  Dr.  @{I}Allan  Havesome @{UI}attended the show. Even @{I}Petro, @{UI}who does not
service o@{B}Amiga@{UB} show, was not there.

They  stated  that  some  major announcement, no revealed before, would be made.
The  news  was  that the developer machine is no longer called @{B}"OS 4.0"@{UB} and that
it will not have @{B}Windows@{UB} on it. Great news!

They  stated  that  the  IRC  logs  from the show would be posted in a given WEB
pages. There is nothing in their WEB pages.

I  think that it is enough. My mother told me that never promise anything if you
don't  know  it  is  possible  to  fulfill.  I blocked the release of this issue
waiting for some important news which never was planned to announce.

Anyway,  the  great  news  is  that  the  jewel  of @{B}Phase 5@{UB} is now shipping. The
eagerly  awaited  @{B}Cybervision PPC@{UB} is now avalaible. If you have a @{B}PPC@{UB} card, this
graphic card is a must.

Remember to visit the @{B}SAUG@{UB} website, which is located in:

	@{B}http://www.saug.com/sau/@{UB}                    (California, USA)

or you can visit its mirrors located in:

	@{B}http://soporte.databasedm.es/amiga/sau/@{UB}     (Spain)

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

	@{I}angel@saug.org @{UI}

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this issue.

@{I}PRESS RELEASE @{UI}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}
June 1st 1998

Continuing the @{B}Amiga@{UB} future with @{B}DES II-2@{UB} and new clients

The  @{B}Amiga RC5 Team@{UB} effort is proud to announce new and improved @{B}PowerPC@{UB} clients
(as well as @{B}68k@{UB}) for the ongoing @{B}RSA Secret Key@{UB} challenges, participating in the
@{B}Distributed Net/Bovine RC5-64@{UB} and the upcoming @{B}DES II-2@{UB} contests.

With  the announcement of the roadmap to the next generation @{B}Amiga@{UB} by @{B}Amiga Inc.@{UB}
we  feel  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  has  a  clear  future,  destined to be at the forefront of
alternative,  perhaps  even  mainstream  computing again. With this knowledge in
hand  our  effort  focuses  on exposure for the @{B}Amiga@{UB} and it's user community by
competing  at  the  very  top  of  above  mentioned challenges, currently ranked
seventh  out  of  thousands of competing teams, amongst others in hot pursuit of
the @{B}Win32@{UB}/@{B}Windows@{UB} team.

Again  many  thanks  must  go to @{I}Stefan 'Blast' Smietanowski @{UI}for the programming
efforts  spent  to improve the clients, @{I}Steve Krueger @{UI}for compiler help and many
others, amongst which of course those already contributing CPU power.

We ask all of you who own an @{B}Amiga@{UB} or support the @{B}Amiga@{UB} in spirit to join us now
for  the  @{B}DES  II-2@{UB}  challenge  starting on July 13th, the short interim project
estimated  to  last  around  ten  days,  intended to show the weakness of 56 bit
encryption. An award of in total US $10,000 is connected to this effort, part of
which could go to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} team and the individual finding the key. Our chances
are  indeed  excellent with over 1000 contributing members governing nearly 2000
machines in total.

The  @{B}Amiga  RC5  Team@{UB}  effort is also providing a mailinglist as a forum for the
discussion on above topics and the effort in general.

For  additional info on how to participate and more in depth explanation, please
visit the @{B}Amiga RC5 Team@{UB} effort homepage at: @{B}http://www.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/rc5@{UB}

Sincerely,

@{B}Amiga RC5 Team@{UB} effort coordinator
@{I}Thomas Tavoly @{UI}- @{I}rc5@amiga.cistron.nl @{UI}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

Announcing  a  new  Web  Site for the Benefit of The @{B}Amiga@{UB} Community, The "@{B}Amiga
Yellow Pages@{UB}".

@{B}Amiga  Yellow  Pages@{UB} is like any other Yellow Pages - but dedicated to the Amiga
only.

Everything  appears as a classified listing From @{B}Amiga International@{UB} (A) through
(B)  books  (@{B}Amiga@{UB}),  Games  developers,  Hardware  Developers, Internet Service
Providers etc etc.

The  big  difference, unlike other web classified pages, is that small companies
without their own internet web site can have a large classified display link.

(@{B}AYP@{UB} is non profit making).

For  example,  one  of  the companies featured @{B}Fore-Matt@{UB} home computing (a small
company  hoping  to  breakthrough  in  the @{B}Amiga@{UB} scene) have a large display box
which includes their phone number.

It is really these type of small business that @{B}AYP@{UB} was setup for.

However  any  one  can have a link as long as they are @{B}Amiga@{UB} related, from large
companies i.e. @{B}Phase 5@{UB} through to Bedroom programmers, user groups etc.

See for yourself at:
                   @{B}http://web.ukonline.co.uk/michael.carrillo@{UB}

@{B}AYP@{UB}  is  also  looking for Shops around the World which stock @{B}Amiga@{UB} Products, If
you know of any such retailers please email me at:
                        @{I}michael.carrillo@ukonline.co.uk @{UI}

Please Help @{B}Amiga Yellow Pages@{UB} to Help the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Community.

Thanks

Regards, @{I}Mikey C @{UI}

@{FG Shine}@{B}CRYSTAL SOFTWARE INTERNATIONAL@{UB} ANNOUNCES NEW @{B}AMIGA@{UB} MAGAZINE@{FG Text}
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/06/15@{FG Text}

Hello Friends!

Allow  me  to  introduce  myself. My name is @{I}Robert Iveson, @{UI}and I'm the Managing
Director  of  the @{B}Amiga@{UB} Publishing Department of @{B}Crystal Software International@{UB}.
I'm also the editor & writer of a brand new, forthcoming magazine entitled @{B}Amiga
Survivor@{UB}.

This  new  'zine  is,  of course, 100% dedicated to the future of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}, and
will include nothing but coverage of @{B}Amiga@{UB} games.

Published  by  the  world-wide  company, @{B}Crystal Software International@{UB} (who has
offices  based  in  the Netherlands, the U.S, the U.K, Australia and Japan) this
new  publication  will be distributed on a worldwide scale, informing @{B}Amiga@{UB} fans
of the planet what's happening on the @{B}Amiga@{UB} games scene.

Like  yourself,  who  are  devoted  to the future of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}, I thought it was
about time a dedicated @{B}Amiga@{UB} games magazine was produced. It's good to know that
after a troublesome three years, the @{B}Amiga@{UB} is finally remaking a name for itself
in the computer-user community. And it's even better to know that many producers
of  new  games,  both  small groups of @{B}Amiga@{UB} fans, as well as larger development
companies  are  creating  more  and  more landmark games that are equal to those
produced  on  today's  top  @{B}PC@{UB}s and consoles. So @{B}Amiga Survivor@{UB} is here to bring
news,  previews  and  reviews  of  all  the  forthcoming  commercial,  freeware,
shareware and licenceware titles.

@{B}Amiga  Survivor@{UB}  has  emerged  from  a  popular small-press fanzine entitled @{B}The
Domain@{UB}  -  the only @{B}Amiga@{UB} PD and Shareware Magazine. After a year of good sales,
@{B}Crystal  Software@{UB}  snapped  up the rights to distribute it worldwide, and due to
its   popular   welcome,  we  have  decided  to  make  the  magazine  much  more
commercialised  and  incorporate  commercial  reviews  and previews, hence @{B}Amiga
Survivor@{UB}.

The  first  issue is set to be released at the end of June / early July, it will
include  regular  articles  such  as @{I}Website of the Month @{UI}, @{I}The Fifth Column @{UI}( a
general  rant  about  the  world  of  computers ), @{I}The Trashcan @{UI}( Software to be
avoided! ), @{I}@{B}Aminet @{UB} Ramble @{UI} (a  monthly  dig  into  the recent @{B}Aminet@{UB} postings),
@{I}Magnetic Fiction @{UI} ( A collection of short stories from @{I}Andy Campbell @{UI}), @{I}Joe and 
Ami @{UI} ( An  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  related exclusive comic strip ), there'll be a letters page, a
hints  and tips page and a page for readers to submit their own ideas for games.
And,  to  sound like a stereotypical advert... lots LOTS more! But of course the
main  part  of the mag will feature news, previews and reviews of all the latest
games - whether they're commercial or free/shareware.

Already  supported by many of the @{B}Amiga@{UB}'s games developers, (including @{B}ClickBoom@{UB}
who  have supplied review titles of @{B}Quake@{UB} and @{B}Myst@{UB}, @{B}Vulcan Software Ltd@{UB} who have
provided  a review copy of @{B}Genetic Species@{UB} for the first issue, @{B}APC&TCP@{UB}, @{B}Islona@{UB},
@{B}The  Real  Ologram@{UB}...  to  name  but a few) not to mention already have a decent
subscriber  base  from  readers  of  @{B}The domain@{UB}, @{B}Amiga Survivor@{UB} is set to play a
major part in the @{B}Amiga@{UB} games scene.

In  case  you  are  not  familiar with @{B}Crystal Software International@{UB}, then I'll
introduce them to you. They are a multi-platform supporting company, who have an
in-house  group  of  programmers  working on many utilities and games as well as
educational titles. They have recently developed a part of their company for the
production of new @{B}Amiga@{UB} titles, both low and high spec. Some titles currently in
development  are  @{B}Gilbert  Goodmate  &  the Mushroom of Phungoria@{UB}, @{B}Goblin Tanks@{UB},
@{B}Arcangel@{UB}  and @{B}Space Patrol@{UB}. They also have a publication division who distribute
many  magazines  for  many different platforms (such as @{B}Atari@{UB}, @{B}PC@{UB}, @{B}Playstation@{UB} &
@{B}M-Crystal@{UB})

@{B}Crystal  Software@{UB}  also  have  the power to sign up titles from small developing
groups,  their  most  recent being from @{I}Suomi-Peli, @{UI}with their game @{B}Damage - The
Sadistic  Butchery  of Humanity@{UB} (@{B}www.sci.fi/~damage@{UB}) So if you have a small game
in development that requires a publisher - then contact us! (Details below!)

The first issue of @{B}Amiga Survivor@{UB} is set for release at the end of June, and can
be purchased direct from me, the editor, @{I}Robert Iveson @{UI}at the below address.

UK Residents can send a cheque or postal order made payable to @{I}Robert Iveson @{UI}for
2.95,  which  includes  postage  and packing. Overseas customers would be better
contacting  @{B}EPIC MARKETING@{UB} ( @{I}epicmarketing@dialin.net @{UI}) to place their order via
credit card.

Each  issue  will be in A5 format, complete with a colour cover. The first issue
will  have an exclusive review of @{B}Vulcan@{UB}'s @{B}Genetic Species@{UB}, plus a report of the
recent  @{B}World  of  Amiga@{UB}  Show held in London, as well as a review of 'the @{B}Amiga@{UB}

@{FG Shine}@{B}EYELIGHT@{UB} ANNOUNCES A NEW AGE IN 3D COMPUTER GRAPHICS@{FG Text}
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/06/15@{FG Text}

@{I}What is @{B}"'Mage." @{UB}? @{UI}

@{B}"'Mage."@{UB} is a complete, modular 3D graphics package that allows to easily model,
animate and render at blazing speed on @{B}Risc @{UB}based computers and workstations.

@{I}Why @{B}Risc @{UB}-only? @{UI}

Because  @{B}Risc@{UB} architecture is perfectly suited to 3D computer graphics. Both the
@{B}PowerPC@{UB}  and  @{B}Mips  R5K@{UB}  architectures provide the invaluable MACC (Multiply and
Accumulate)  all-in-one  instructions  that  easily account for 80% of processor
operations during preview or rendering.

@{I}Is @{B}"'Mage." Tornado3D @{UB}with another name? @{UI}

No,  it  is an entirely different product, that builds on the expertise acquired
developing  @{B}Tornado3D@{UB}.  @{B}"'Mage."@{UB}  however  is  even  more  oriented  towards the
professional  market  and  platform  independance.  @{B}"'Mage."@{UB}  targets the TV and
hi-end video-game special effects production houses.

@{I}Does this mean @{B}Tornado3D @{UB}is dead? Are you leaving the @{B}Amiga @{UB}? @{UI}

No,  not  at  all.  @{B}Tornado3D@{UB}  development  continues, we are already working to
define  @{B}V3.0@{UB}  features.  @{B}"'Mage."@{UB} already runs on @{B}PPC Amiga@{UB}s and will presumably
run  on  "Future  @{B}Amiga@{UB}s".  @{B}Tornado3D@{UB}  and  @{B}"'Mage."@{UB} are two different products,
managed  by  different development teams and oriented towards different markets.
What's  more,  @{B}"'Mage."@{UB}'s  100%  @{B}PowerPC@{UB}  technology  and industry standard user
interface are likely to be integrated into future releases of @{B}Tornado3D@{UB} as well.

@{I}How much does @{B}"'Mage." @{UB}cost? When will it be available? @{UI}

@{B}"'Mage."@{UB}  is  tentatively  priced  at 1299,00 USD for first promotional release.
This  first  release  distribution is scheduled to begin in october 1998, with a
massive marketing campaign to follow in first quarter 1999.

@{I}Will there be some kind of cross-grade from @{B}Tornado3D @{UB}to @{B}"'Mage." @{UB}? @{UI}

Yes,  @{B}Tornado3D@{UB}  users  will  be entitled to cross-grade to @{B}"'Mage."@{UB} should they
want to. As per @{B}Eyelight@{UB}'s policy, long time @{B}Tornado3D@{UB} users will be entitled to
more  convenient  upgrades.  "First  Buyers" (users that bought @{B}T3D@{UB} before @{B}T3D@{UB}'s
DEMO  version  was  released)  will  even be able to cross-grade to @{B}"'Mage."@{UB} for
free.

@{I}Any hint about @{B}"'Mage."'s @{UB}features? Do @{B}Tornado3D's @{UB}features apply? @{UI}

@{B}Tornado3D@{UB}  and  @{B}"'Mage."@{UB}  share  some features, but they are different products.
Where  @{B}Tornado3D@{UB}  is  a "swiss army knife" of 3D graphics, offering something to
everyone,  @{B}"'Mage."@{UB}  has  a  smaller and more specialized feature set. A new web
site  devoted  to  @{B}"'Mage."@{UB} is under construction and will hold all the @{B}"'Mage."@{UB}
specific issues.

@{I}Supported platforms @{UI}

@{B}XMEN@{UB}

@{B}Quake@{UB}  players  now  have @{B}Marvel@{UB}s @{B}X-Men@{UB} to contend with -- think you can take on
@{I}Xaviers @{UI} best?!  It's  a  small  world but somebody has to rule it - you got the
guts?!

The Mission - to eliminate threat of @{I}Apocalypse's @{UI}plan for world domination.

The Gear - Cyborg development allows for series of morphing forearm weapons.

Note; Powerpacks, Energy Modules and ammunition is limited.

Briefing - @{I}Apocalypse @{UI}has captured and cloned the @{B}X-Men@{UB} creating in their wake a
terrible and mindless mutant militia.

But  while  @{I}Apocalypse's @{UI} strength increases, so do the number of his enemies...
including @{I}Magneto. @{UI}

In  his attempts to thwart @{I}Apocalypse's @{UI}plans for world domination - @{I}Magneto @{UI}has
used  his  mutant power to bend metal to his will and has transformed you into a
killer cyborg. Only by completing this mission successfully do you have any hope
of re-gaining your humanity.

You  are  now  @{I}Magneto's @{UI} weapon  against  the  countless  slave-soldiers under
@{I}Apocalypse's @{UI}command.

YOU SHALL BE THE APOCALYPSE OF @{I}APOCALYPSE @{UI}!!

@{I}Multi-play @{UI}

The  @{B}X-Men@{UB}  multi-player environment is an almost totally unique experience. Not
only  do  you get to choose that character, you have that character again in the
game  with  its own unique model and skin, but each character has its own unique
mutant  powers.  And  no  more  guarding  that precious weapon re-spawn spot, as
everyone has all the weapons from the beginning. You just have to find the ammo.

There are two modes of mulit-play: All weapons or special powers only.

All  weapons  allows all of the characters to use to use the weapons featured in
single play as well as their individual powers.

But  the  major  revolution here is the inclusion of a weapons free multi-player
environment.

Special  Powers  only pits @{B}X-Men@{UB} against @{B}X-Men@{UB} with only their individual unique
powers at their disposal.

This  is  the  one  that  all  you @{B}X-Men@{UB} fans will want to play. It pits @{I}Wolvie @{UI}
against  @{I}Gambit, @{UI} @{I}Rogue @{UI} against  @{I}Cyclops, @{UI} with  only their powers to keep them
alive.  Can you as @{I}Wolvering @{UI}dodge @{I}Storms @{UI}raging lightening blasts while getting
close enough to do some ripping with your claws?

If  you  have ever fantasized about being your favorite @{B}X-Men@{UB} character the this
is your dream come true!

AVAILABLE: Exclusively from @{B}Alive Mediasoft@{UB}.

PRICE: £18.99 + £1 p&p. (£2 p&p outside UK)

"normal"  human  population  fled  from  earth  after  the last of the wars. The
mutants  left  behind  have  begun to revive the technology that started it all.
These  mutants  are being led by an unknown mutant named @{B}Shrak@{UB}. You come back to
earth  to  check  things  out  and  inadvertently crash-land. Your mission is to
eradicate  @{B}Shrak@{UB}  and  his mutant clan, collect the circuit cards to repair your
ship, and get the hell off of earth and back to the safety of your new world.

The 12 levels of @{B}Shrak@{UB} show a high degree of originality. some have a great deal
of under-water exploration, while others have open spaces, bridges and cages.

There are 3 new utilities to help you get through the levels: a flaw, a claw,

@{B}Shrak@{UB} brings new blood to the good old @{B}Quake@{UB}.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/06/15@{FG Text}

SAN  JOSE,  Calif.--The new generation @{B}Yamaha CRW2216E@{UB} with 2X write, 2X rewrite
and  16X  read  speeds  and the @{B}CRW4216S@{UB} with 4X write, 2X rewrite, and 16X read
will be shown at @{B}PC Expo@{UB} in New York in the @{B}Yamaha Systems Technology Inc.@{UB} Booth
No. 4587.

The  two  new drives represent the fastest read speeds of any CD-RW drive on the
market,  and  boast  the  same  high  reliability of the previous members of the
award-winning  @{B}Yamaha  Multifunction  CD-RW@{UB}  drives.  Both are available for the
retail and OEM markets.

The  @{B}CRW2216E@{UB}  will be shown with an @{B}ATAPI@{UB} (@{B}IDE@{UB}) interface; the @{B}CRW4216S@{UB} will be
shown  with  a  @{B}SCSI@{UB}  interface.  (Both  will  be  available  later,  with  both
interfaces).  All  of  the  features of the earlier CD-RW drives from @{B}Yamaha@{UB} are
incorporated as well, in the same half-height, 5-1/4 inch space.

In  a  related  announcement,  @{B}Yamaha  Japan@{UB}  has  completed  a  higher capacity
production  line for the CD-RW products, to meet the ever-growing demands of the
CD-RW drive marketplace. The new production line is up and running.

@{I}"These  announcements  reflect @{B}Yamaha's @{UB}continuing response to the needs of the 
market," @{UI} said  @{I}Dean  Quarnstrom, @{UI}CDR Sales Manager for the @{B}Yamaha@{UB} CD-RW product
line.  @{I}"The  consumer looking for a lower priced CD-RW with 2X write speed will 
love the high quality and fast read speed of the @{B}CRW2216E. @{UB}The high end market, 
which  traditionally  wants more speed in their write function, will choose the 
@{B}CRW4216S. @{UB}This new product pair spans the spectrum of user needs, with many new 
enhancements." @{UI}

The  @{B}CRW4216S@{UB} writing speed, using standard CD-R media is 4X normal speed. Using
CD-RW  media,  rewriting  speed  is  2X.  Both  can be read at 16X. The @{B}CRW2216E@{UB}
writing  speed  is  2X normal speed with 2X rewrite and 16X read speeds. The new
drives conform to standard Orange Book Part II and Part III.

The  CDs  produced  by  the  CDR  function of the drives can be read on ordinary
CD-ROM  drives,  CDR  drives and Multi-Read CD/DVD drives. Media produced by the
CD-RW function of the two new drives can be read on Multi-Read CD/DVD drives.

@{I}@{B}CRW2216 @{UB}and @{B}CRW4216 @{UB}Features @{UI}

The new @{B}CRW2216@{UB} and @{B}CRW4216@{UB} include all of the features of the previous CD-R and
CD-RW  drives,  as  well  as  the  new,  advanced  16X read speed. Some of these
features include:

   o 2MB data buffer on the @{B}CRW4216@{UB} to eliminate buffer underrun.
   o 1MB data buffer on the @{B}CRW2216@{UB} to eliminate buffer underrun.
   o @{B}RapidLinked(TM) Packet Writing@{UB} for higher performance data transfer.
   o @{B}SCSI@{UB} models support synchronous data transfer for high-end duplication.
   o Flash ROM for simple downloading of firmware upgrades.
   o Packet    writing,    track-at-once,    disc-at-once/session-at-once    and
     multisession modes.
   o Eight  standard  formats  supported  including  CD-Digital  Audio,  CD-ROM,
     CD-ROMXA  (both  Photo  and  Video  CD), CD-I, CD-G (karaoke), CD-Extra and
     Video CD.
   o Running Optimum Power Control (ROPC) for maximized media writing integrity.
   o Support  of all major platforms including @{B}Windows '95@{UB}, @{B}Windows '98@{UB}, @{B}Windows
     NT@{UB},  @{B}OS2@{UB},  @{B}UNIX@{UB},  @{B}Sun@{UB},  @{B}Macintosh@{UB}, @{B}Novell@{UB}, @{B}NLS@{UB}, @{B}HP9000@{UB}, @{B}DOS@{UB}, @{B}DEC@{UB}, @{B}Amiga@{UB} and
     @{B}AIX@{UB}.

Our  show  this year is taking place at the @{B}Hyatt Regency Columbus@{UB}, which offers
us  almost  7,000  square  feet of exhibitor space, making this show THE largest
show  in North America this year and doubling our show from last year! The @{B}Hyatt
Regency@{UB}  is  a  perfect location for our event and features dozens of downstairs
restaurants  and  shops  as well as being close by many activities, restaurants,
and  micro  breweries  of  downtown Columbus. We are also proud to announce that
IRC, Web cam, and WWW access will be available from the show floor this year. We
will  be  setting  up  a  dedicated  lines  for each of these allowing for total
participation   from   the  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  community  from  around  the  world  with  no
interruptions!

You  can  check  out  who  is  going  to  be  present  at  our  show by visiting
@{B}http://www.amicon.org/mae.html@{UB} and following the @{I}"Who will be there" @{UI}link. Right
now,  we've  only  listed  a few companies and user groups who have committed at
this  time.  Many  more will be appearing soon as the show dates draw closer, so
please watch for updates in the coming weeks.

At  this time the seminars are being lined up with the gracious help of the @{B}ICOA@{UB}
(@{B}http://www.amiganet.org/icoa/@{UB})   who   have   done   an   outstanding   job  of
coordination and scheduling past seminars at other major @{B}Amiga@{UB} events around the
world.  Our  seminars page will be updated soon with a list of times, costs, and
descriptions of the seminars that will be offered.

Vendors  are  encouraged  to  sign up soon and get your requests for prime floor
space  in  early. All vendors will receive detailed instructions and floor specs
as   the  show  dates  draw  closer.  Pipe  and  drape  is  available  for  that
"professional"   look   as   well   as   dedicated  phone  lines.  Please  visit

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/06/22@{FG Text}

To all readers of @{B}The Amiga Monitor:@{UB}

Recently, the hard disk in our main @{B}Amiga@{UB} died swiftly and suddenly, taking with
it  all  data  compiled  since the last backup. Unfortunately, this included all
changes  made  to the @{B}AM@{UB} Distribution List database since it was moved over from
@{B}CompuServe@{UB} software on a @{B}PC@{UB} several months ago.

As  of  this writing, I have sent out a notification to all people listed in our
old database. If you do not receive this notification but have asked to be added
to the list, please send an e-mail message to @{I}MikeWebb@compuserve.com @{UI}saying so,
and specifying which list(s) you would like to subscribe to.

The lists are:

   o @{B}HTML@{UB} archived with @{B}LhA@{UB}
   o @{B}HTML@{UB} archived with @{B}ZIP@{UB}
   o @{B}AmigaGuide@{UB} archived with @{B}LhA@{UB} *

* Note:  There  is  currently a very significant backlog of issues needing to be
translated  from  @{B}HTML@{UB}  to @{B}AmigaGuide@{UB}. It is a priority and will be addressed as
soon  as  there  is time to spare, but keep this in mind when asking to be added
to a list.

In  addition, there are new @{B}HTML@{UB} Notification and @{B}AmigaGuide@{UB} Notification lists.
We announce the availability of new issues without actually sending them out via
those lists.

Thank you, and my apologies for any inconvenience.

The News

If  you are a @{B}Studio 16@{UB} user with a @{B}Sunrize@{UB} Audio card and thought you were left
out in the cold when @{B}Sunrize@{UB} folded. Take heart.

The  @{B}Studio  16@{UB}  mailing  list  has  managed  to  make @{B}AHI@{UB} and other utilities a
possibility  for  the  @{B}Sunrize@{UB}  audio cards. The list moderator and owner @{I}Kenny 
Nilsen@{UI} (@{I}kenny@bgnett.no @{UI}), has gained valuable information and more @{B}AHI@{UB} progress
has  been  made.  @{I}Kenny @{UI} is  an @{B}Amiga@{UB} programmer and apparently a very good one.
@{I}Kenny @{UI},  armed  with  important  library  information,  has been able to use the
information  to  write  some  utilities  that  access the @{B}Sunrize@{UB} cards and play
samples  directly  to  the  card  with  out  using @{B}Studio16@{UB}. This utility is now
available from @{B}Aminet@{UB}.

	@{B}ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/util/misc/SuperModel.lha@{UB}

This  is  the  first step to @{B}AHI@{UB}. @{I}Kenny @{UI}is continuing to work on utilities using
the  information gained. He has added a page to his web site to help support the
effort.  Any one who is interested in seeing @{B}AHI@{UB} support for their @{B}Sunrize@{UB} card,
should should go to the site and fill out the form he has prepared. You can also
join  the  list  and  have  access  to  technical  and  software help from other
exsperienced users.

Here  is  the  information as posted by @{I}Kenny @{UI}in the @{B}Studio 16@{UB} mailing list. You
can  also contact him to find out how to join the list if you are a @{B}Sunrize@{UB} card
owner.

     Survey Announcement

     I  have  created a small survey I was hoping the citizens on this list will
     take  the time to answer. Basically the result of the survey will determine
     future  development  of  @{B}Studio  16@{UB}  add-on's  from  my  part.  You will be
     anonymous by default answering this survey.

     The address for it is:
                       @{B}http://www.bgnett.no/~kenny/survey.html@{UB}

     The  survey will run until 15. of July this year. I will put out a reminder
     every  second  week (if I remember.. :^). It's important that you report to
     me if the form doesn't work with your browser.

     Thank you.
     - @{I}Kenny @{UI}

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The  @{B}Studio  16@{UB}  list  also  has the lofty ambition of spawing a next generation
sound card and a midi/sample succesor to @{B}Bars&Pipes Pro@{UB}.

@{FG Shine}@{B}CLOANTO RELEASES@{UB} @{B}PP 6.4@{UB} AS FREE & ANNOUNCES DEVELOPMENT OF VERSION @{B}8@{UB}@{FG Text}
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/06/26@{FG Text}

In  the  evolution  of  @{B}Personal  Paint@{UB},  which has become the leading title for
editing  palette-based  graphics,  version  @{B}6.4@{UB}  represents  a  milestone in new
features,  reliability,  diffusion  and new code written. In hindsight, it might
have  deserved  a  version number of @{B}"7"@{UB} (just as the features introduced in the
latest  version  might have justified an @{B}"8"@{UB} release, instead of the more humble
@{B}7.1@{UB}).  The  particular  release  of  @{B}Personal Paint 6.4@{UB} now on Aminet (@{B}biz/cloan@{UB}
directory,        @{B}PPaint64.lha@{UB}       archive,       easy       access       from
@{B}http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/download.html@{UB})  is  little more than 18 months old,
and includes support for anim-brushes and @{B}ARexx@{UB}, which were not supported by the
first @{B}6.4@{UB} release (also bundled with some @{B}Amiga@{UB} computers).

With  few  exceptions, such as the lack of full documentation and no support for
file  formats  such  as @{B}GIF@{UB} (which is included only with the commercial package,
under  license  of  @{B}Unisys  Corporation@{UB}),  this  is  the  full retail version of
@{B}Personal  Paint 6.4@{UB}, including 20 different user interface languages. Additional
information  on  the  distribution  is contained in the archive, as is a special
upgrade  offer  to the latest version @{B}7.1@{UB}. The version of @{B}Personal Paint 6.4@{UB} now
released  for  free  download  is  not  a  demonstration  version,  but is fully
functional, and may be used without limitations for productive applications.

@{B}Personal  Paint  7.1@{UB} remains the latest version, while we are working on version
@{B}8@{UB},  which  however is not expected to be ready at least until the second half of
1999.  @{B}Personal  Paint  8@{UB}  requires a major re-write to support features such as
true  color,  layers, and advanced animation functionality. At the same time, it
is  now very important that the new code be written in a portable style, because
it is still unknown what the new @{B}Amiga OS@{UB} will look like, other than it will not
be the @{B}Amiga@{UB} that we are used to. Suggestions regarding the features of @{B}Personal
Paint  8@{UB}  are  very  welcome,  and  can be addressed to @{I}suggestions@cloanto.com @{UI}
(preferably containing @{B}"Personal Paint 8"@{UB} in the message title).

For additional information, please refer to the @{B}Amiga@{UB} section of the @{B}Cloanto@{UB} web
site at @{B}http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/@{UB}

@{FG Shine}@{B}AA+@{UB} CHIP SET@{FG Text}
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/06/30@{FG Text}

@{B}Access Innovation Ltd@{UB} are working on a next generation @{B}AGA@{UB} chip set, called @{B}AA+@{UB},
which offers higher levels of performance, features and integration.

The  chip  set  is  based around a totally new full 32-bit functional core, this
then  has a 16-bit @{B}AGA@{UB} hardware register emulation wrapped around it. The 32-bit
core,  using  modern memory access techniques can achieve 20-times the bandwidth
of  the  original  @{B}AGA@{UB}  chip  memory.  The  effect of improved memory access and
buffering  is  that @{B}DMA@{UB} access for the video display takes significantly less of
the  available bandwidth and is less time critical, this allows a @{B}Unified Memory
Architecture@{UB}  (@{B}UMA@{UB})  to  be  used  without  causing  significant  conflicts with
processor  operation.  When  accessing the original @{B}Blitter@{UB} the 16-bit registers
are translated to 32-bit operations, using burst memory access at up to 20-times
the speed of the original @{B}Blitter@{UB}.

@{I}FEATURE @{UI}

   o Processor   interface  (@{B}68020@{UB},  @{B}68030@{UB},  @{B}68040@{UB},  @{B}ColdFire  5102@{UB}  or  @{B}PowerPC@{UB}
     options).
   o Address decoding for @{B}ROM@{UB}, @{B}RTC@{UB}, @{B}RAM@{UB}, etc.
   o @{B}DRAM@{UB} controller for @{B}SIMM@{UB}'s/@{B}DIMM@{UB}'s.
   o @{B}PCI@{UB} bus controller.
   o @{B}AGA@{UB} compatible.
   o Supports   additional   chunky   mode  displays  while  retaining  backward
     compatibility  with  @{B}WB3.1@{UB}  (chunky  display  works  using  @{B}CyberGraphics@{UB} /
     @{B}Picasso96@{UB}).
   o Resolutions up to 1024x768x16-bit.
   o 16-bit sound.
   o @{B}UMA@{UB} for lowest memory sub-system costs.
   o @{B}Blitter@{UB} up to 20-times faster.
   o High-density floppy drive support.
   o @{B}CIA@{UB}'s (optionally using external buffers to reduce @{B}ASIC@{UB} pin count).
   o @{B}DMA@{UB} engine.
   o Interface  to  a  SuperIO chip to allow low cost serial, parallel, @{B}UDMA IDE@{UB}
     and @{B}USB@{UB} to be implemented off chip.

It  is  intended  that  features  such  as  @{B}Firewire@{UB},  modems  and  networks  be
implemented using a plug-in @{B}PCI@{UB} card or integrated @{B}PCI@{UB} chip solution.

@{FG Shine}NEWS FROM @{B}SOFTLOGIK@{UB}@{FG Text}
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/06/30@{FG Text}

The following is from @{B}SoftLogik@{UB}'s web site.

@{B}SoftLogik@{UB}  has  several  projects  in the works for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. We'd thought we'd
outline  our  upcoming plans, while some dates on these projects are sketchy, we
wanted  you  to  know  we are still committed to supporting the @{B}Amiga@{UB} for a long
time to come.

@{B}PageStream 3.3b@{UB}

This  release  will  be  the  last  update to @{B}PageStream 3.3@{UB}/@{B}3.2@{UB}/@{B}3.1 Amiga@{UB}. This
version fixes a couple obscure but difficult to fix bugs, and adds a couple much
needed  features.  Beta  testing will be limited to @{B}3.3@{UB} owners initially and the
beta  versions will be posted in the @{B}PageStream 3@{UB} secure ftp site. Betas will be
made available as we go. Initial beta will be up Friday, May 7th.

     @{I}Potential @{B}3.3b @{UB}features: @{UI}
      o Edit text hooks for extensions.
      o Revamp styletags, including: Styletag delete loop.
      o Character/Paragraph combo.
      o Styletag override.
      o Undo/Redo: Fix in/out of page/spread/pasteboard undo remainder of object
        editing.
      o Dynamically move articles to proper document/chapter level.
      o Spell Checking.
      o Color palette for text.
      o Reshape path curves->lines->curves and closing.
      o Min/Max/Opt Word/Character spacing.

@{B}PageStream 3.4@{UB}

@{B}PageStream  3.4@{UB}  will  be  a very minor cost upgrade to @{B}Amiga@{UB} owners. The actual
number  of  features  will depend on how long the first fully functional @{B}Windows@{UB}
libraries  take.  The  longer  it  takes, the more time for adding features. The
initial  beta  release  will  be  mid  June  and  will  overlap  with the end of
@{B}PageStream3.3b@{UB} testing.

     @{I}Potential @{B}3.4 @{UB}features: @{UI}
      o Native Indexing
      o @{B}PDF@{UB} export
      o Speedup editing text, especially long articles
      o Add undo/redo for remaining functions (delete page/chapters, etc)
      o Tick based palette update
      o Multilevel chapter/page numbering/names (ie 6.8.1)
      o Hilight Page Number/Data/Time etc to edit
      o Defined styletags & variables at chapter level
      o Native signature printing (many pages on 1)
      o Business card/label printing (many copies of page on 1)
      o Configurable FPO size
      o Save progress bar

@{B}PageStream 4.0@{UB}

This  is  a  real unknown. We will time it with the final release of the @{B}Windows@{UB}
version. These are just some of the items from the top of our list. Just showing
a few cards instead of holding them close :-)

@{FG Shine}STATEMENT OF @{B}CLOANTO@{UB} ABOUT SOME COMMON QUESTIONS@{FG Text}
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/07/06@{FG Text}

From  time  to  time  we  become aware, through direct user emails and newsgroup
posts,  of  some questions related to our @{B}Amiga@{UB} products and projects. We always
answer  directly  to  all  inquiries,  but we would also like to publicly try to
answer and clarify some of the more popular issues.

No  doubt,  a frequent question is about our plans with respect to @{B}PowerPC Amiga@{UB}
expansion  boards. Last year, when we released a @{B}PowerPC@{UB} version of the @{B}Personal
Paint@{UB} blitting library, we were very proud to be among the first to release some
@{B}PowerPC@{UB}  code  for the @{B}Amiga@{UB}. Since then, we did not port entire packages to the
@{B}PowerPC@{UB}.  This  is  because  porting  a complex program like @{B}Personal Paint@{UB}, for
example,  is not just a matter of simply "recompiling" it, or at least it is not
with  the development tools and the @{B}PowerPC@{UB} libraries available so far. We still
plan  to  do  this  for  @{B}Personal  Paint  8@{UB},  which  is  designed with more code
portability in mind, if the @{B}PowerPC@{UB} will be accepted and endorsed as an official
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  platform, or if tools emerge that make it possible to port @{B}Personal Paint@{UB}
to  a  @{B}PowerPC@{UB}  system  by  using  the same code as for the @{B}68K@{UB} version. In this
latter case, we might even port @{B}Personal Paint 7.x@{UB}.

Another  issue  is  that  the  original  @{B}Personal Paint PowerPC@{UB} blitting library
released  last  year  does  not  work with newer @{B}PowerPC@{UB} expansion systems. This
blitting  library  was  tested  both  by @{B}Cloanto@{UB} and by the manufacturers of the
boards  (who were aware of our release plans), and originally worked flawlessly.
After  the  release of the library on the @{B}Personal Paint 7.1@{UB} CD-ROM, the @{B}PowerPC@{UB}
expansion  systems  were  changed  in  a way that created incompatibilities with
existing  @{B}PowerPC@{UB} software, such as this library. We changed the code twice, and
released it on @{B}Aminet@{UB}, in the @{B}biz/cloan@{UB} directory, and we also shared our source
code  with  the developers of the expansion systems, but given the continued and
repeated  incompatibilities,  we now feel that the maintenance overhead does not
justify  the  performance  improvement, and, as explained, we are looking at the
whole  matter  from  a  broader  perspective. To completely solve this issue, we
recommend  to use the standard @{B}68K@{UB} blitting libraries, which are used by default
by  the  program.  In  our  tests with @{B}Amiga@{UB} systems having both a @{B}PowerPC@{UB} and a
@{B}68060@{UB}  CPU,  the  @{B}68060@{UB}  blitting  library  was only 10% slower than the @{B}PowerPC@{UB}
library.  It  is  to be expected that @{B}PowerPC Amiga@{UB} systems will only be able to
express their full potential when the complete @{B}Amiga OS@{UB} and all new software are
entirely  compiled  for  the  @{B}PowerPC@{UB}.  Before this occurs, and unless it can be
verified  tha at least some software which can justify the overall investment is
available  for  the  @{B}PowerPC@{UB}  and  runs  considerably  faster  than on a real or
emulated  @{B}68K Amiga@{UB}, we recommend to use @{B}68K Amiga@{UB} systems such as the @{B}68060@{UB}, or
emulation.

It  is  no  secret  that,  while the power of the CPUs used in @{B}PC@{UB}s doubles about
every  18  months, we became aware of the fact that an @{B}Amiga@{UB} can now be emulated
quite well by other systems. In some cases, which can only increase rapidly over
time,  emulated  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  systems  are  already cheaper and/or faster than silicon
ones.  Whatever  the  official  @{B}Amiga@{UB}  of the future will be, whether it will be
based  on  a @{B}PowerPC@{UB}, or on a different (non-@{B}68K@{UB}) CPU, it will need emulation to
run  the  current  @{B}Amiga  OS@{UB}  and  applications  (which have now officially been
defined  as "@{B}Classic Amiga@{UB}"). We plan to continue supporting @{B}Amiga@{UB} emulation and
other  means  of  integrating  the @{B}Classic Amiga@{UB} with different platforms, as we
have  successfully done with the @{B}Amiga Forever@{UB} package. We will also continue to
invest  in  the  @{B}Amiga@{UB},  preferably  by focussing on development on one official
platform,  rather  than  politics related to the use of one CPU or the other. In
any case, we plan to release new @{B}Amiga@{UB} products before next Christmas.

These  are  hard  times for commercial @{B}Amiga@{UB} software developers: sales are low,
and  the uncertainty about the future has never been as high as it is now, since
we don't even know what the new @{B}Amiga OS@{UB} we have to write software for will look
like.  We hope that we had a chance to clarify some doubts about our own future,
and we thank all users for their patience and continued support. It appears that
it is now our turn to be patient and wait to see what the future will bring.

@{B}mSQL@{UB} is the first (and only) available @{B}SQL@{UB} database server running on @{B}Amiga@{UB}.

Since there're more and more people using @{B}mSQL@{UB} on @{B}Amiga@{UB}, i've setup this mailing

You can get more information on @{B}http://altern.org/amsql@{UB}

@{FG Fill}DATE: 1998/07/13@{FG Text}

@{I}FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE @{UI}

@{B}F1  Software@{UB}  have  just  signed  up a brand new shareware music creator for the
@{B}Amiga@{UB}  called  @{B}BEATBOX  2@{UB}  (@{B}http://www.ware5d.demon.co.uk/beatbox.htm@{UB}).  You can
download  the  very  latest version now from the @{B}F1@{UB} website at the address shown
above. Surf across now and give it a whirl.

@{B}BEATBOX  2@{UB}  works  on  any  @{B}WB2.01+ Amiga@{UB} with 1MB chip memory, but as usual the
better the base machine the easier it is to use this title. Please remember that
sound samples love chip mem :)

The  program is a joint venture between @{I}James L Boyd @{UI}of Scotland and @{I}Curt Esser @{UI}
from  America. To get your hands on the registration keyfile costs just 7.00GBP,
details are included in the archive.

Music  doesn't get any easier! Ok, what is it then? It's a music editing system,
but with a difference. Instead of wading through a bunch of hex numbers, you can
enter your song with an easy to use point and click graphic interface.

Features include:

  1. Works on ANY @{B}Amiga@{UB} with @{B}WB 2.01@{UB} or better.
  2. GFX card compatable.
  3. Many user options.
  4. Use any @{I}.iff @{UI}sound samples (up to 99 per song).
  5. Online help (through @{B}MultiView@{UB}).
  6. Online program prefs, including screenmode and font selection.
  7. Easy and fun to use (no musical knowledge necessary).
  8. Now with supersonic load/save routines.
  9. Example song included.

We also have a bit of bad news this month I'm afraid :(

@{B}F1@{UB}  have  now  withdrawn from the @{B}Roswell@{UB} project It was not a snap decision you
understand  or  any  fault  of the development team. We're very sad to leave the
game,  but  with the state of the @{B}Amiga@{UB} market at the moment and the news that a
new  @{B}Amiga@{UB} may not be ready for another two years, just helped us to make up our
minds.

Oh  well,  we  wish  @{I}Andy @{UI} all  the very best with @{B}Roswell@{UB} and hope that he gets
another sponsor soon.

If  you need any copyright free graphics or have some cool images to share, then
why not visit our new page at the @{B}F1@{UB} website:
                     @{B}http://www.ware5d.demon.co.uk/free.htm@{UB}

I'm trying to build-up a little collection for customers to use and it may even
help would be artists to show off their talents.

Till next time...

@{B}Eat  The  Whistle@{UB}  is  a  football  game  (American people call it "soccer"), in
development for @{B}Hurricane Studios@{UB} (formely called @{B}Hurricane Software@{UB}).

The final game will feature the following:

   o World cup, leagues, cups with real teams (with slightly modified names);
   o More  than  550 frames of animations for the player, 300 for the goalkeeper
     and 100 for the referee;
   o Spoken comment in the CD-ROM version;
   o 30 different fields, including muddy, frozen and wet;
   o Fouls, corners, throw-in, heading and other special shots with an intuitive
     control system;
   o Tactic editor, team players (with individual stats) and team editor.
   o Replays with load and save option;
   o Role playing: possibility to play as the whole team or only as a player;
   o Control method with acceleration/deceleration;
   o Arcade version with powerups and bonuses (something like @{B}Speedball II@{UB});
   o 0, 1 and 2 players mode;
   o not  yet  ready  but  planned  3  e  4  players mode (via 4 joy adaptors or
     keyboard);
   o control  via  Joystick,  @{B}CD32@{UB} compatible joypads (with a better control) or
     two buttons joysticks;

And talking about its technical features

   o System friendly: it runs in multitasking;
   o It runs on any @{B}Amiga@{UB}, also on clones, with at least 1MB of chip memory;
   o Graphic cards supported with @{B}CyberGraphX@{UB} and @{B}Picasso96@{UB};
   o Sound cards supported with @{B}AHI@{UB};
   o Time synchronized, faster CPU get faster framerate but not faster gameplay.

Now,  you  can download a free demo version (perhaps it is better to say that it
is a work-in-progress) of @{B}Eat the Whistle@{UB} from:

Shareware Discount Offers (2.7.98)

@{B}PerSuaSiVe  SoftWorX@{UB}  now  offers  constant discount rates to users that like to
register more than one program package at once.

If  you  like  to register one of the programs labeled 1 through 6, you are - at
the same time only - granted a discount on all products labeled A though H.

This  means:  you  may  -  but  need  not  - pick some of the other programs for
registration as well, and save some money on registration.

PLEASE  ALWAYS  FILL  OUT  THE  REGISTRATION FORMS OF THE PROGRAMS YOU'D LIKE TO
REGISTER, THEN SIMPLY ADD this FORM - AT LEAST FILL OUT THE REGISTRATION FORM OF
THE PROGRAM SELECTED BY ITS NUMBER (if available).

An  exception  are  the @{B}SuperView@{UB}-Library @{B}PPC@{UB} modules, which only can be ordered
solely (no. 7) or added to one of the other packages (letter H).

New also is the possibility of explicitely requested email shipment, which again
will reduce the total registration fee by 5 DM (only for total sums over 25 DM).

The  @{B}CyberVisionPPC@{UB} is a high-performance graphic card which can be installed on
the   expansion   slot   of  the  @{B}PowerPC604e@{UB}-based  @{B}PowerUp@{UB}  accelerators,  the
@{B}Cyberstorm  PPC@{UB}  and  the @{B}Blizzard 2604 Power Board@{UB}. Especially for the @{B}Blizzard
2604@{UB}  the  use of the @{B}CyberVisionPPC@{UB} is highly recommended as the slow access to
the  @{B}ECS@{UB}  chip  memory  or @{B}Zorro-II@{UB}-based graphics boards in the @{B}A1500@{UB}/@{B}A2000@{UB} may
limit  the  system  performance in applications with lots of graphic output. The
performance of the @{B}CyberVisionPPC@{UB} benefits from the high data bandwidth achieved
by  the use of the direct connection to the processor bus by use of the graphics
direct  connector  which  incredibly  speeds  up  for  example  3D rendering and
display.

Not  only the ultra-fast access of the processor into the video memory, but also
the  internal  speed  and  functionality  of  the  @{B}CyberVisionPPC@{UB} will provide a
breathtaking  performance.  The  @{B}CyberVisionPPC@{UB}  is  equipped  with the powerful
@{B}PERMEDIA2@{UB}  graphics  controller, which provides an outstanding 3D performance of
up  to  80  million  textured  3D  pixels  per second, with hardware-accelerated
rendering  functions such as z-buffering, gouraud-shading, fogging, blending and
anti-aliasing.  As  the  design  of  the  @{B}PERMEDIA2@{UB} hardware suits perfectly for
@{B}OpenGL@{UB}   implementations,   it's   3D   performance   can  support  the  @{B}CyberGL@{UB}
functionality  of  @{B}CyberGraphX  V3  Native@{UB}  which  comes  along with the @{B}PowerUp@{UB}
boards.   In  combination  with  the  high  floating-point  performance  of  the
@{B}PowerPC604e@{UB}   processor   a   breathtaking   performance   in   professional  3D
applications   can   be  achieved  by  this  implementation.  Additionally,  the
@{B}PERMEDIA2@{UB}  processor  supports  functions  like  color  space conversion, chroma
keying  and XY-scaling which will be used by the software MPEG decoding routines
of @{B}CyberGraphX V3 Native@{UB}.

Memory  on the @{B}CyberVisionPPC@{UB} is 64 bit wide SGRAM with data throuput upto 800MB
per  second  which results on use of the ultra fast RAMDAC in the possibility to
display  upto 1280x1024 in true color at 85 Hz screen refresh rate and 1600x1200
in  true color at 60 Hz or high color at 85 Hz. The board will be delivered with
4 MB or 8 MB display memory.

The following is from the @{B}Blue Black Solution@{UB} web site:
	@{B}http://homepages.enterprise.net/dallsopp/@{UB}

@{I}Monday, 1st June, 1998 @{UI}

   o We  have  come  to  the decision that the demo will only be released to the
     four  potential  publishers we have been talking with. Only when we believe
     that  the  demo is upto scratch for public release will it happen. We don't
     want to give a crap first impression.

   o I  got  an  early  preview  of one of the new buildings @{I}Andre' @{UI}is currently
     working  on. He claims to have done a whole set of these in the same style,
     and  I'm sure you'll think it looks very good. With this very fast work the
     demo should be ready soon.

   o Introduced a very fast version of object clipping in the main game engine.

   o The  @{B}Amiga  Nutta@{UB}  @{I}Question Of The Work @{UI}should have finished today, and the
     result  should  be  on  their  webpage  tonight.  I'll put the news up here
     tomorrow night, regarding our decison to the question.

   o Good  news  for  @{B}CounterStrike@{UB}  is  that  another  @{B}Amiga C&C@{UB} clone has been
     cancelled, more lovely customers for us I suppose!!

@{I}Thursday, 4th June, 1998 @{UI}

   o Created  a  new  page  which currently holds the results of the @{B}Amiga Nutta@{UB}
     @{I}Question  Of  The  Week @{UI}. I think you'll be quite suprised by the result to
     make @{B}CounterStrike@{UB} a 16/32Mb minimum spec game.

   o Changed  the buttons on the side panel again. I think they look better than
     the  old  ones.  However  there  is  still  a  big  space  for the official
     @{B}CounterStrike@{UB}  logo  which  no one has designed for us yet. Come on send'em
     in!!

   o I  might  need  to  recruit someone to create some maps for the demo of the
     game  at  least,  maybe  for the full version. The maps will be made out of
     about 500 16x16 sized tiles and created with my custom map editor. Decision
     next week, mail me if you're interested in this tedious task.

@{I}Saturday, 20th June, 1998 @{UI}

    o Created  the  time  sheet  page  which will be used to give the public the
      status on our sub projects within @{B}CounterStrike@{UB}.

    o Two jobs are available in the jobs section of the site.

    o Uploaded  a  screenshot  which  was  taken from the current version of the
      Publishers  Demo  which  will  be released at the end of the month. It was
      taken from the LowRes version but is shown in HighRes on your browser.

@{FG Shine}THE @{B}AMIGA RC5 TEAM@{UB} EFFORT NEWS@{FG Text}
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The following is from the @{B}Amiga RC5 Team@{UB} effort homepage at:
	@{B}http://www.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/rc5/@{UB}

@{I}01-Jun-98 @{UI}

First  reports  on  new clients are in, most are positive (increase in @{B}PPC@{UB} speed
for  example,  more  solid  for  most  etc.), though a couple of small bugs were
found:  when running with @{I}-runoffline, @{UI}and running out of blocks client crashes.
This  and  anything  else  found  will be fixed shortly, stay tuned. It is still
advisable to upgrade, even if you had no trouble before.

@{I}02-Jun-98 @{UI}

A  note  to  people for whom the new clients crash: make absolutely sure you are
not  using  old buffers, especially from clients with versions @{B}2.6xxx@{UB}. These are
not  compatible,  flush  with  old  client first and delete leftover files, then
fetch new ones and run new client on that.

@{I}19-Jun-98 @{UI}

A  reminder:  If  you need any quick help with clients, the main IRC channel for
th e @{B}RC5@{UB} effort is @{B}#distributed@{UB} on @{B}EFnet@{UB}. Also available are @{B}#AmigaRC5@{UB} on @{B}IRCnet@{UB}
(recently established, @{I}'Spookie' @{UI}will try to keep it open). And of course @{B}#amiga@{UB}
on @{B}ANet@{UB} @{I}('aTmosh'). @{UI}

@{I}27-Jun-98 @{UI}

Only  300  thousand  blocks  separate  us from the @{B}Win32@{UB} team now, we might just
catch   them  before  @{B}DES  II-2@{UB}  starts.  New  @{B}2.7100@{UB}  clients  are  already  in
development,  hopefully  they  will  be  ready  for @{B}DES II-2@{UB}. Note that @{B}DES II-2@{UB}
starts  13th July and is estimated to run less than 10 days, keep an eye on this
section for announcement of the new clients. In any case you should upgrade to a
@{B}DES@{UB}  capable client now if you haven't already (preferably the already available
@{B}2.7021.405@{UB}  one,  since  that  one  will  automatically  switch  to  @{B}DES II-2@{UB} if
configured right).
