<UL>Dr. Peter Kittel repeats once again that the ONE is no Mac clone, but
a machine compliant to CHRP or PPCP. The MacOS will run on it, but
it was not designed to just run the MacOS. <CITE>the ONE's architecture is a mixture of the A2000/A3000 and the

<UL>According to Jens Maertens, Maxon may leave the Amiga. He says

This means that there is no Maxon C++ for PPC being developed,
whereas Haage's StormC is already available. This may mean that
Maxon are not interested in porting their software to PPC
Amiga users. [Or it may mean that there are problems with Phase5. -Y]

<UL>Michael Schulz forwards an announcement of the first PowerUp program
from Cloanto. The <CODE>personal_ppc_blit.library</CODE> is a replacement for the
Amiga's blitter that takes advantage of the PPC speed and as such is
more than twice as fast as the AGA Amiga hardware blitter.

<UL><FONT COLOR="#BA1212">As you may have noticed, I have severely modified the layout
of this page. The current approach is much neater, as it doesn't rely on
a background image anymore. Additionally, the source of these pages is now &quot;modular&quot;,
so that from now on I can change the layout of the whole text with only one
changement in a prefs file. I hope you like the new look of this page,
I certainly do. ;-)</FONT>

</B></FONT> (08-May-97

<UL>Dr. Peter Kittel says PIOS are including both pOS and BeOS with
the PIOS One, as <CITE>both are rather new and yet incomplete, so there are only speculations
about their market chances and final capabilities</CITE>.
<CITE>Both have their
promising features and some limits. So it's a competition, and nobody
can tell in the moment which one will turn out as the better. So we
have to keep a rather neutral position</CITE>.

</B></FONT> (07-May-97

<UL>Markus Marquardt posts yet another impression on one of the
tower kits that are out there. He says that the quality is
pretty low, that &quot;easy fitting&quot; of the components is not
possible, that buyers are supposed to work on the PSU and that
the documentation is from 1995. He ends his post with the
advice that you should not buy a tower kit if you're no expert.
Not surprisingly he doesn't want to name the manufacturer of
the tower kit.

<UL>Tim DeWitt forwards an imaginary G2000 press release written
by George No&euml;l. Tim DeWitt says he liked it, but other posters
didn't seem to like it at all, as George No&euml;l was refering to the Amiga as <CITE>lesbian
computer</CITE>, talking about <CITE>Mr. Dull EL. Larson</CITE>

the user flag has been set to -1, meaning that no one but the sysop can

<UL>Rainer Benda says he just received a phone call from Petro T., who
apparently is reading the newsgroups...
Apparently, Petro T. doesn't really like Rainer's attitude towards
him, especially as Rainer is Amiga retailer and as such depending
on AI. In reply, Rainer writes that he thinks Petro is incapable,
that he doesn't post his opinion as a revenge for being kicked out
at AT, that Petro should be happy about any Amga retailer thst still
exists. He also points out that AT's attitude to have the same
prices for retailers and end users is a bit strange...

<UL>According to Dr. Peter Kittel, the PIOS One <CITE>introduces the architecture of Amiga accelerator cards into the
PPCP/CHRP world</CITE>. The ONE a PPCP/CHRP machine, not a PC, but provides means to use PC cards. They are using
the pOS, because it <CITE>follows the principles of AmigaOS of being extremely compact and
