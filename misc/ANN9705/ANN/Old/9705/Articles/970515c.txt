Subject ........: Cheap 200MHz accelerator... some details!

Hi,

Remember the 200MHz accelerator that Amiga Computing mentioned in April?

Well, here's some details!!

The device is called the "Impulse Supercharger" and will be sold in the UK
by Instrinic Computer Systems, whose also supply tower expansions. Their
URL is :

http://www.centrenet.co.uk/~ics/new.html

To briefly quote :

"this device enables existing accelerators to triple and quadruple their
speeds. A typical 
example is the Blizzard 030 IV 50Mhz, using the Scorpio Supercharger its
clock speed 
can be increased to 150Mhz and the Blizzard 060 50Mhz increased to
200Mhz!!"

Price is to be announced, but expected to be 130-150UKP :-)

BTW, I've decided to get a 1240T/ERC!  Hopefully the new price reduction
(down to 495DM
or around 170UKP) will be available at the WOA show!

Cheers.

Madhu.
