The custom chipset has been holding the Amiga back since around 1989.
The current graphics chips used in PCI graphics cards are far faster,
and are developed by companies that invest huge amounts of money into
research and development of *just* graphics chipsets.  What makes you
think that Gateway could afford to make the investment necessary to
become a world leader in graphics chips, when even big companies like
IBM don't do this?  And what's so bad about "another OS on a run of the
mill motherboard" - do you think that the Amiga OS is so poor that it
can't stand on its own merit, or are you suffering from the delusion
that Amiga OS needs a custom chipset?

You don't have to be crazy to live in this planet - but it helps.
