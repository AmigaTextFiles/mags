No, you don't. 3.1 was a significant improvement over 3.0. 3.0 was in
Commodore terms more like a quick hack to get the A4000 (and later A1200
and A4000T) out the door. Only later it was cleaned up and was made
backwards compatible with ECS and OCS, and accelerated also during all
this!

No, it must have been 1993, so two years before Win95. The plural is
justified.
