And I happen to find people with long hair and pony tail trustworthy,
of the right spirit. Back in 1985 we saw a video of the Amiga
presentation in the Met in New York. The presenter was Bob Pariseau
of Amiga Los Gatos and only when he turned to point to something on
screen behind him, I recognized his hair reaching down to his hips.
Yeah :-). Right spirit. Dave Haynie has also a pony tail, BTW.
But I hasten to add that there are also a lot of nice Amiga people
with short hair, it's not a prerequisite. And that Mr. Taylor of GW2K
marketing also doesn't have the shortest hair...
