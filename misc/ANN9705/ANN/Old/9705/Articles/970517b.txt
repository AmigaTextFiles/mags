clickBOOM Supports Power Up

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   
   Toronto, May 5, 1997: PXL computers and clickBOOM are proud to
   announce a cooperation with Phase 5 Digital Products on making games
   for Power Amiga.
   
   "We strongly believe that the future for the Amiga computer lies in
   PowerPC processor. Furthermore, we believe Phase 5 is and will
   continue to be the Amiga hardware leader. Therefore, we have selected
   Power Amiga as our future platform of choice", says Alexander
   Petrovic, PXL and clickBOOM producer.
   
   Appropriately enough, the first ever Power Amiga game will be Myst
   from clickBOOM. It is a perfect opportunity for Myst and PowerUp
   accelerators to appear at the same time. Following Myst, other forth
   coming clickBOOM "killer games" will be fully optimized for the
   PowerPC chip, as well.
   
   Phase 5 Digital Products highly appreciates the development of Myst
   for the PowerUp accelerators and the plans of clickBOOM to add PowerUp
   support to more titles in the future. "We are happy to see how engaged
   clickBOOM has realized all their ambitious projects in the past, and
   we are excited that their new projects will be targeted for the
   PowerUp accelerators" says Wolf Dietrich of phase 5. "Beside all the
   demanding creativity software that we expect to come for the PowerUp
   boards, it's good to see powerful games with the real thrill coming
   also soon. What would such a powerhorse Amiga be without some
   breathtaking amusement? Still fast, but less fun... It's really
   impressive and good to see that clickBOOM is in the front line of
   visionary development for a new performance dimension."
   
   Support for Power Amigas will have several distinct advantages:
    1. It will give users a valid reason to upgrade as soon as PowerPC
       boards become available.
    2. New clickBOOM games written for Power Amiga will be breathtaking
       and a serious competition to the games on other platforms. This in
       return, will make the rest of the industry look very positively on
       the Amiga market.
    3. Impressive CPU power will allow clickBOOM a technical freedom to
       convert any big game from other platforms to the Power Amiga.
       
   
   The exact timeline of clickBOOM Power Amiga releases is still to be
   decided. Currently, clickBOOM's strategy can be outlined in two steps:
    1. Starting with Myst, a couple of forth coming projects will support
       both 680x0 and PowerPC chip.
    2. ClickBOOM will use this transitional period to work on a first
       Power Amiga-only "killer" game. After its release, all the
       following games will be Power Amiga-only.
       
   
   For more information about our future strategy visit clickBOOM web
   site at www.clickboom.com
   
   We hope you like our plan and share our vision. Naturally, for the
   Power Amiga to ultimately succeed we need your support and input. As
   always, please feel free to contact us at info@clickboom.com
   
   Best regards,
   PXL computers and clickBOOM

There's the "killer software" PowerUP needs to take off for the home
market. Does anyone else smell a PowerUP/Myst combo?
