Well, in the Q&A session at WoA, Petro and the Gateway people
repeatedly stated that it's still under investigation whether AI will
do R&D itself or outsource it to partner companies. This "under
investigation" was one of the more frequent phrases used in replies.

I picked one piece of Petro's speech which I found highly interesting:

] We need to talk with the technology companies from the AMIGA business and
] exchange know-how.
] It is also important that we explore an open AMIGA platform, use industry
] standard components to make it cheaper to produce, faster to develop and
] easier to upgrade.

Dave couldn't have expressed better the philosophy of his design.
