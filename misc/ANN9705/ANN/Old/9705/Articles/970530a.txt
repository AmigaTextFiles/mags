No, there is a big difference: The ONE complies to a *general*, *global*
standard called CHRP or PPCP, where among a number of others also MacOS
will run on. Run *also*, not as the only one, and perhaps not as the
dominating one. So in *first* line it's a CHRP machine, where Apple will
deliver a version of its OS which will be *adapted* to run on every CHRP
machine in the world. Call it a CHRP machine, but not a Mac clone,
because it isn't.

Hmm, the ONE's architecture is a mixture of the A2000/A3000 and the
BeBox, plus one I/O chip designed by Apple and another I/O chip designed
by Intel thrown in. I consider the architectural similarity to the A2000
higher than that single Apple chip. So you are wrong in your assumption.

But I see no proof by you about your assumed hardware architecture
similarities of Macs and the ONE. It isn't there. So you can only compare
by the mere fact that both can run some (different) version of MacOS.
And then every desktop Amiga is in the same boat as the ONE.

>Take away that stuff and you still have an Amiga. Amiga is no MAC clone.

What "stuff"? For Shapeshifter you don't need any hardware, it's just
software. So after your reasoning every desktop Amiga is a Mac.
You can't get out of it.
