Subject ........: Phase 5 quality worries

  Hi all...

  A couple of weeks ago I bought a CyberVision64/3D and even though
hardware wise it's very impressive, I must say that I'm a *little* worried
about Phase 5's ability to bring out an OS for the A\Box that can follow up
the Amiga.

  I mean it just seems to me that the CyberGraphX software really lacks
polish.  Plus it seems a bit buggy and the user interface for configuring
monitor types isn't exactly what you would call intuitive.  I mean, I've
got quite an expensive VGA monitor here that on a PC that I bring home from
work will do 1024*768 in 24 million colours just fine.  But I havn't been
able to get anything better than 640*480 on the CyberVision.  The whole
picture just goes screwy.  An review of the CV86/3D that I was reading in
CU Amiga spoke of the same problems.

  Now I'll admit that I'm a programmer and not a hardware guru, and that a
knowledge of monitor refresh rates isn't one of my strong points, but you
shouldn't have to be a hardware guru just to setup an 800*600*256 screen.
I just can't help but think that if the A\Box's OS is anything like the
configuration software for the CV64 then we'll be in for a Windoze type OS
where you just fiddle with it until it works and then don't touch it,
hoping that it stays working!

  I can't run Enforcer and Mungwall anymore now that I've got my CV64 as I
get way too many hits, and from commercial programs like Dirctory Opus 5 as
well...

  Anyway, these are just observations on my part.  Anybody got any
suggestions or observations of their own?
