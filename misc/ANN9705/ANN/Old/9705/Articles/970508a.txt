Both are rather new and yet incomplete, so there are only speculations
about their market chances and final capabilities. Both have their
promising features and some limits. So it's a competition, and nobody
can tell in the moment which one will turn out as the better. So we
have to keep a rather neutral position and support them both by make
them running on our hardware.

>Is Pios really a big enough company to market and support both?

That's less our task than that of Be and proDAD. We do also our share,
of course, but they are the makers and designers.
