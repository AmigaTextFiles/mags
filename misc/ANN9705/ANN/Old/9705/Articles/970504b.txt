It introduces the architecture of Amiga accelerator cards into the
PPCP/CHRP world. The machine is a PPCP/CHRP machine, not a PC. But it
is so flexible to provide means to use PC cards. Don't forget that also
the desktop Amigas have ISA slots (though you need a GG2 card to use
them from the Amiga side, but it's possible), so we're in the same
boat as the Amigas.

>I have seen a beta version of pOS. It sucks.

Ugh. It follows the principles of AmigaOS of being extremely compact and
efficient. It has the potential to become the fastest OS on the PPC (and
on the Intel PC, they're doing a port for that, too) far and wide.
If that's not something.

>Another point of view. Bebox (the machine) is dead. BeOS will die soon.

Ugh. The BeBox is not dead because it were bad, but because it was no
more *needed*, there's now decent enough hardware for BeOS available
from a selection of vendors. And BeOS flies on these machines. You
should see it running on identical hardware side to side with MacOS,
it's a massacre. So BeOS is taking deep inroads to the Mac market and
has a strong future. It's an open question whether Apple will be able
to cope with it when Rhapsody is finished.
