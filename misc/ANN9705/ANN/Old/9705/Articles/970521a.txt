Actually it was in 1994. Commodore were too worried about going bankrupt
to put OS 3.1 in new AGA machines. They were selling off existing stock
using OS 3.0 in ROMs and selling those machines off for cheap in order to
get money fast.  Village Tronic was the only company who got the rights to
produce and distribute the OS 3.1 ROM and kit before Commodore went
bankrupt. As a matter of fact, OS 3.1 was one of things Commodore was
still working on the days before they went bankrupt.. the other stuff
being related to the CD32. This was mentioned in Dave Haynie's The
Deathbed Vigil video tape.

So the work for OS 3.1 was finished sometime around Commodore's demise in
1994 and they never got the chance to release machines with it as
standard.  Village Tronic had the legal rights to produce and distribute
the OS ROM and kit afterwards so they started doing that later in 1994.
This was the only way to get OS 3.1 in your computer. Due to limited
numbers produced and the fact that Village Tronic now had a monopoly on
AmigaOS 3.1 distribution, I would say that was one of the main reasons for
the high price tag of the kit at the beginning.

Escom/Amiga Technologies took over in 1995 and they finally released AGA
machines with OS 3.1 as standard.  During this time they found out certain
developers and mail order houses were pirating the ROM (burning their own)
and distributing it alone without the disks and manuals. They put a stop
to that.  I think the rest is history.
