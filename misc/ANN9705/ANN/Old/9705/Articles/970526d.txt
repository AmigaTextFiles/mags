No, I don't think that's the implication.  The strongest implication has
been that Gateway may switch from Intel to AMD.  Saying Microsoft is too
powerful is not the same as saying "We won't use their OS."  There is the
implication, in part enabled by the Amiga and by AMD and Cyrix, that
Gateway will not 100% live or die by the whims of Intel and Microsoft.
It's a general statement of independence, of which the Amiga is playing a
part, but the Amiga is not going to replace their PCs.
