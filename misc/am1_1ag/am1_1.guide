                                @{I}Editor's Notes...@{UI}

First, I would like to thank you all for your interest in our new online
Amiga magazine, "The Amiga Monitor." With this being our first issue, there
is a great deal to be said about what our mission is, what we hope to
accomplish and how, and what it all means for you, the Amiga community.
My introductory article (listed below in the Table of Contents) will attempt
to explain the format and general philosophy of "The Amiga Monitor."

The Amiga's future is quite uncertain now.  It could cease to exist in a
technological sense now, or it could go on achieve a certain measure of
success in the computer industry.  There will probably be very little middle
ground in this case.  Although much of what will happen to the Amiga depends
upon the companies involved with it, much more still is based on the actions,
and views, of the Amiga community.  Yes, my friends, you and I and the rest
of us; we have achieved a greater level of "community spirit" than the
proponents of nearly any other product in industrial history.  And we should
be proud of that, and take advantage of it.  These are trying times, and
they are crucial times; and we want to make the best of them.So without
further ado, we will enter Volume 1, Issue 1 of "The Amiga Monitor."

@{B}The Charter of The Amiga Monitor@{UB}

@{I}Our mission, where we hope to go and how, and how each of us got here@{UI}

@{U}                                                                           @{UU}

Some people may wonder what our motive is. The Amiga's fate is sealed, they
say, and there is no point in trying to carry it on any further. Certainly
starting a new online Amiga magazine, in this day and age, is absurd and
futile. So why are we attempting such an ambitious project?

To put it frankly, it all stems from faith. Faith and hope, among many
other thoughts and feelings. It is the same ethereal "glue" that has held
us together as a community for so long. Think about it; when else has the
word "community" applied so appropriately to a group in our situation? It
says something if we have such integrity as a group. I'm sure the phrases
"Macintosh Community" and "IBM Community" have been applied in the past, but
much more loosely than in this case. The word "community" implies that we
have strength in our union, and a common ground from which we begin. The
evidence of it is tremendous: Amiga user groups continue to thrive, Amiga
users gather together in online forums, and the 3rd-party product support
has taken us further than ever otherwise imaginable despite recent stagnating
technology.

I'm sure that this ideal has often been misinterpreted.  Do we love our
Amigas? Are we spiritually bound to a piece of computing hardware? Taken in
that light, the whole affair sounds quite silly and meaningless; and the
answer is a resounding NO!

Certainly many people enjoy using, and playing and working with their Amigas.
Most of us are computer users, in the first place, because we want to be,
and in many cases, we chose the Amiga platform because we would enjoy working
with it more than any alternative, or because of its various technical
strengths.  Certainly, though, MicroSoft and Apple have made great strides
in the user-friendliness and utility of their software, and the hardware now
available for the other platforms sometimes has truly amazing capability. No
one can doubt that the last 4 years, in which almost nothing fundamental has
changed, has been a time of deterioration for the Amiga's relative standing,
and a time of frustration for its advocates.  Some people have jumped ship,
many software developers among them; but a solid core remains.  What is it
that keeps us going?

As I mentioned, I seriously doubt that we feel any sort of serious adoration
for our Amigas.  (if I'm wrong, then there are some interesting Usenet
Newsgroups waiting to be created).  Seriously, though...I feel that we may
enjoy using our Amigas, and that many of us wouldn't trade them for PC's of
much higher power; but what we CLING to and LOVE is WHAT IT STANDS FOR!!!!

Yes, the graphics are nice, the animation is fast, the music sounds good,
the user-interface is friendly, the video capabilities are convenient, the
multitasking is powerful, the motorola chips are easier to program, the Fast
RAM is fast and the Chip RAM is chipper!...etc., etc. But the reason we
cling together and stand up for the cause of the Amiga is not simply for any
technical qualities alone.  We stand up for it for what it represents: 
Individualism! The right to be different! The freedom of choice! The list
goes on. The Amiga is a poor, disadvantaged, orphaned child that could have
done much better had it been treated better; and we want to MAKE this
HAPPEN because WE see the strengths and virtues in IT that we have STRIVED
for for all our lives.  And THAT is why we continue the crusade. That is
why we have survived over a decade of mismanagement, yet still hold out
quite reasonable hopes for some level of success.

 So no, we aren't in love with our machines; we are in love with the hope,
and the ideal.  We embrace the cause, and that for which it stands.

@{I}Our Mission@{UI}

So with that, we initiate our effort; The Amiga Monitor has set a course and
is now under way. What we hope to bring you, on a monthly basis, is an 
up-to-date digest of goings-on in the Amiga community, combined with
interesting features and insightful editorial.  We want to bring you the
story, and illustrate it with appropriate analysis and information. This,
and more, is what we shall endeavor to do in the years ahead.

@{I}Business-related informtion@{UI}

The Amiga Monitor is published using a variety of programs on an
Amiga 500/GVP A530. It is currently slated to be available in five versions:
online in HTML, online in AmigaGuide, HTML archived in LhA,
HTML archived in ZIP, and AmigaGuide archived in LhA. 

The AmigaGuide versions may not be available immediately following
publication of Issue 1 in HTML, due to necessary translation times. 
GIF-format images will be supplied with HTML versions, and IFF-format
images will be supplied with the AmigaGuide versions.

The home site of the Amiga Monitor is The Webb Site, Michael Webb's web page
on Amigas, http://ourworld.compuserve.com/HomePages/MikeWebb/. The Webb Site,
and The Amiga Monitor in HTML, are both optimized. The Amiga Monitor is also
subject to becoming available at other locations on the internet. We ask
that we be informed of any such locations so as to maintain a corresponding
database, and that whatever version(s) of the magazine is/are uploaded/made
available is/are done so in its/their entirety.

@{I}Our Story@{UI}

With all such bureaucracy nicely out of the way, we can get to more 
interesting matters.

There is actually relatively little to say regarding the origins of The
Amiga Monitor. The idea occurred to me in late May of 1996, shortly after I
got my web page. June was a time of putting together a staff from the highly
knowledgeable regular people in Real Time Conference on the Starship Amiga
Roundtable on Genie. Work officially began in the first half of July, with
Issue 1's publication date set for the second half of July. The pressures
involved in starting a new magazine, however, proved to be too much for such
expectations, so we moved the publication date to early August. Now that
this process has been established, we expect to have significantly less
difficulty in sticking to schedule.  So we shall see you monthly!

I shall leave it to each of the other staff members to explain their
backgrounds.

I was born in Binghamton in 1979, and I have lived there ever since. I grew
up in the 1980's, when personal computers basically came into existence and
developed. All 3 platforms -- IBM PC, Macintosh, and Amiga -- got their
start in the first half of that decade. My earliest recollection of
computers is of the "Word Processors" (at the time meaning not just the
software but the whole computer) sometimes given away as prizes on game
shows. My uncle had always been involved with computers, however, so I
inevitably ended up spending some time around them. It never had a huge
impact on me, though, until later when one of the silicon marvels took up
residence in our house.

One afternoon, my uncle came over with a small, wedge-shaped computer with
a built in keyboard. The classic Commodore symbol was clearly visible on the
case; the italicized word "Amiga" was pressed into the top of it.

The monitor was small and delivered colors in terms of grey; the mousepad
was an issue of TV Guide (or was it Readers' Digest?). And I was instantly
drawn to it.  I never knew it could be so much fun to drag around windows
and screens...but boy, did we have a riot with it! And also in running about
20 instances of the Clock and various Demos programs, and tiling the screen
with them. "It's multitasking" he told me; it meant little at the time
(although when we got a PC in 1994 it became very clear just what
multitasking was...and wasn't). By the end of the day, I had discovered
IconEd and Say, and had the computer saying in it's matter-of-fact,
condescending tone "You have sinned against God."

The year was 1987; the Amiga was young, and times were good. Alternative
Society had yet to be invented, and society still had some sense of moral
direction and decent music...;-). I knew nothing of the Amiga, or even
Commodore, for that matter, however; all I knew was that an A500 was a lot
of fun to use. And as I discovered soon after that, MarbleMadness!, Crystal
Hammer, Deluxe Paint II, and Aegis Sonix were all very fun to use. One day,
however, the A500 had to go. My uncle took it to his office in order to use
it with his work. It didn't matter too much to me, since I hadn't really
gotten attached to it.

But Christmas came soon after, and I was given a new Amiga A500 with a
Commodore 1084S monitor, and a Star NX-1000 printer. I continued to tool
around with the same old software, and our collection began to grow to
include WordPerfect (which my mother once used to crank out a massive
printing project of 100's of recipe books from those that our school had
compiled and decided to produce in a big way), F/A-18 Interceptor,
The Duel: Test Drive II, and Deluxe Paint III, to name some. I continued to
use the system for years; twice, we had a hard disk (massive case, 50mb)
and SCSI interface c/o my uncle, but it died inexplicably both times.

Eventually, 1994 came, and I was surprised with a new GVP A530 Turbo as a
birthday present (it was a lot smaller, but did a lot more than the old HD).
To summarize a lot of little details, I was truly off and running with that.
I began to seek information in the Amiga community, subscribing to AmigaWorld
(I think we did once before...but who knows where the old issues went) and
gradually increasing my knowledge through experience. For the first time, I
was truly a "computer user," going far beyond anything I had done before.

Then I found myself in late 1995, and a friend at IBM managed to procure a
2400 baud modem for $5. As I knew from a little time spent using the
internet at his apartment and at Binghamton University, and from all the
massive media hype, there was a whole other world out there. Seeking
something to call besides my friend's modem, I attempted unsuccessfully to
subscribe to AOL, and then successfully to CompuServe in November of 1995.
I joined Genie a little over a month later. I almost immediately discovered
the Starship Amiga Roundtable, and soon Real Time Conference, where I began
to spend a lot of time.  That's where I met Sam Ormes who was in charge of
the place, and all the rest, and even Denny Atkin one time. Towards spring,
I was fortunate enough to be included among Sam's group of new RTC staff
members. Welcome to the Tuesday Night Webb Site! I am WebbMaster@HelpDesk.

The year is 1996, and I still have the old A500, plus a new one, and the
first one as well.  The 1084S and Star NX-1000 are still here too. I got a
web page in May (http://ourworld.compuserve.com/HomePages/MikeWebb/), and
towards the end of that month, first introduced the idea for The Amiga
Monitor.  Then came a long period of getting the project off the drawing
board.  It's been a busy 2 months!

The rest, as they say, is history; best wishes to the Amiga community and
industry, and all proponents thereof.  We hope to be with you for some time.

I'm the senior man here (in age anyhow!)....born many years ago in
Washington D.C.   Did military service as a Navy meteorologistduring the
Korean War (aircraft carrier duty).   After a year at the University of
Miami, obtained B.A.  degree in Mexico City.

The next 20+ years were spent living in Puerto Rico, Panama, Singapore and
El Salvador.    While spending 12 years in thelatter, acquired a wife and 2
sons.    What was I doing in those strange places?   .....Far East Manager
for the Borden Company inthe Orient, General Manager in Central America for
Bristol-Myers, and then Yardley of London.     Forget the CIA stories! 

In 1986 created the world's first TV station inside a correctional facility
(ICTV - Inmate/Corrections Television) in Miami. Widely featured in national
and international media...about to celebrate 10 years on the air.

Television production led me (naturally) to the Amiga in August of 1993
with the acquisition of a brand new A1200. Within thefirst year of AmigaLife
added 9 more Amigas to the arsenal!

In 1994 subscribed to Genie and found yet another new world. By 1995 began
writing the Sam Report with inside information from CEI in Miami, a major
player in the post-Commodore debacle.  Since mid-1995 a HelpDesk sysop on
Genie and as of March 1996,assigned responsibility for managing the RTC
section of the Amiga Starship on Genie.

My first contact with the Amiga was a friend's A1000. During those days,
I was using a Commodore 128 and neither could I afford, nor did I want, an
Amiga. Late in the 1980s, after the release of the A2000, this friend
persuaded me to go to the AmiExpo in Manhattan. Many stops at the Impulse
booth firmly placed the need to own an Amiga in my mind. Their big product
was the ray-tracing program Silver.

In July 1988 I finally had enough money to buy a plain Amiga 500 with 512k
and OS 1.2.  I then joined the Westchester Amiga Users Group, whose
newsletter I now publish. I purchased Turbo Silver and have upgraded
continuously through Imagine 4.0.  From this unexpanded Amiga I now have
both an Amiga 2500/020 and an Amiga 1200/030, both with expansion RAM and
hard drives. The 2500 also has a Mimetics Framebuffer, an Opalvision, and a
286 Bridgeboard. The 2500 is not the best Amiga in the world, but with the
ability to capture frames of video and display 24-bit images, it is a fun
machine.  Even with all of this continuous computing power since my first
Commodore 64 in 1982, I only got into telecommunications when I received a
2400 baud modem from a customer in 1994. I got onto a bunch of pay online
services and local and not so local PC and Amiga BBSes to the point where,
now, I moderate the Genie Amiga Help Desk on Friday nights where this
magazine went from the zygote stage to birth.

I fix and sell MS-DOS/Windows PCs for a living and study at the Institute
for Advanced Conservative Studies.  First thing I would normally do when I
got home was turn on my 2500 and get into Imagine, VistaPro or Distant Suns.
Although I also own an IBM PS/2 Model 60, a Fat Macintosh, and many
Commodores, no other machine has been used as much as my 2500. Even though
the 1200 with its AGA, two SCSI controllers and OS 3.1 is now the machine of
choice for me, the 2500 still finds it uses and is still my favorite. What
other computer sold in 1990 could be brought up to pentium speed today?

I regularly hang out online either on Aminet downloading software or on
BBSes discussing computers and politics, especially with those that disagree
with me.  Lastly, I am a member of Team Amiga, a group set up on the FidoNet
Amiga echo, first as an answer to Team OS/2.  Now, it is a group of people
sworn to support the Amiga (http://www.cybertours.com/~rlembree/teamiga.htm).
Well, here I am.

Hello

Somebody asked me what I could do for the Amiga community, and I really
don't have a good answer except that I have been kicking around the
Amiga/Commodore community for a few years now and have done a few things to
amuse myself.  So I thought I would tell you about myself and the fact that
I like helping people learn new things because I often learn new things
myself in the process and I enjoy learning.

I went to college from 78-80 and learned various computer languages; COBOL,
Pascal, PL-1, RPG, FORTRAN, APL, BASIC, LISP, and a couple of others that I
don't remember anymore.  I then ran out of money and joined the Navy. I
wanted a computer system to play with, one I could afford, and take with me
to different duty stations around the country. A friend of mine was an owner
of a local Commodore products retailer that went out of business. This was
due to a customer backing out of a $50,000 order after the products had been
shipped, and Commodore selling it's inventory to chain stores like KMart for
cheaper prices than the dealers could afford to sell them. So, he sold me
part of his inventory cheap.

In 1985, I bought my first computer system for $125.00: a C64, a 1541 disk
drive with an installed device number switch and write protect override, and
a 1660 300 baud modem.  This system led to my involvement in setting up a
Commodore user's group of sorts on a United States Navy nuclear submarine.
Then, somebody was "downgrading" to an IBM and was selling their C128. So, I
bought it and fell in love with the flatter keyboard. My roommate at the
time was on QLink, my first introduction to the concept of an on-line system
run for profit. Up to that point, I had been calling some local BB's and the
university's computer system. I joined QLink and Compu$erve for a while.
Then, I ran a BBS system called "FRP BBS System" for a year.

I was not heavily involved in computing from 1988 until 1992 due to being
poor and at sea. I joined Genie in 1992 and became staff in late 1992 or
thereabouts.  During this time frame (since 1992), I like to think I have
made up for lost time.  I have since purchased and regularly use a CMD HD,
Ramlink, FD 2000, REU and SwiftLink, and tried publishing a newsletter
(and found out it takes an awful lot of time to do well), and set up and
ran another BBS based on the Color 64 BBS software.

I have learned an awful lot in the last couple of years. My current long
term computer goal is to become proficient in the C++ programming language
so I can write really awesome game programs.

My Amiga setup at the moment is a Amiga 2000HD with a Fusion Forty
accelerator (040 at 28mhz) with 8 megs of 32-bit ram installed on it, a
Multiface III card (2 serial ports and 1 parallel port), RapidFire which is
a DKB SCSI II controller with 4 meg of memory installed on it, a MegaChip
2000 (DKB's 2 meg chip ram expander), ICD's flicker fixer, Emplant Deluxe,
and a 386 bridgeboard with a 50mhz 486 upgrade. I have expanded the IBM
slots inside so they're all 16-bit slots. I also have an 800 meg HD
installed in the drive bay and an internal 3/12 HD installed in the other
floppy drive slot.  Also connected is 2 CD's: one using 3.1's cdfs, the
other using Asim's file system.  Also connected to it are a tape drive, a
SyQuest, and 2 more HD's.  Oh, by the way, I had to boost the power supply
up to 300 watts.

I have also used at one time or another AMax II, 2091, Oktagon 2008 SCSI
controller.  Also in the house is an IBM 486DX 33 MHz computer, 1 Mac SE,
28,800, 2 14,400's, 9600 baud modems, and miscellaneous ancient Commodore
stuff like the 8032, minichief HD, 3 or 4 monitors, a couple of 1571's and
another RamLink, Turbomaster CPU, C64 and other miscellaneous items I can't
remember at the moment.  In the real world I am still going to school part
time, and I am working as an electronic technician part-time which I have
been doing at one place or another for close to 11 years now, I guess.

So I like to think that I can answer a lot of questions about moving files
from one platform to another, Emulators, telecommunications and hardware
questions in general.

Hello & WELCOME TO THE AMIGA MONITOR!!

I'm Fred, and your not! 8^)

Seriously 'tho, I'm hopeful that this undertaking by none other than Mr.
Mike Webb is a GREAT success, and can bring us Amiga folks together, better
than before.  In this first article I'm writing I'll introduce myself to you
folks, and invite you to introduce yourself to Mike, me, and the other
people here.  So.........

I'm Frederic Ericksen, (Canadian/French first name, Norwegian last). I was
born, and currently still live in Detroit, Michigan and have three major
interests in life.  Music.........  Music........  and, well, MUSIC!! I have
4 Amigas of various sorts, and like Mike, (and  most of us) started on an
A500.  With that machine I put in many an hour with Dr.  T's KCS, Roger
Powell's Texture, and now I have Bars & Pipes which I'm using with many MIDI
keyboards (11), sound modules and drum machines. I also sync up the songs I
create on Amiga via SMPTE to a Fostex R-8, 8 track tape deck. I'm really a
Sax player by training, but at age 14 or so I became entranced by bands like
Pink Floyd, Yes, and ELP.  (How did they get those SOUNDS!!!) I started
playing guitar in high school, and bought my first Korg synth in '78. It was
a cool little analog monophonic machine called a 770. Later, after reading
an article in Keyboard magazine, (then called Contemporary Keyboard), I saw
Jan Hammer with a modified Moog around his neck.  I chopped the Korg up,
made a wooden box to house the keyboard, and using a phone cord I hooked it
to the main unit.  I was out front with the guitar player! Many bands later,
I now have a REAL Minimoog, and will NEVER chop THAT baby up like I did the
Korg.

Enough about me. I'd like to invite anyone into making music with the Amiga
to write to me, and to tell me what you're using, and if I can be of any
help to the Amiga music-making community. Let me know what subjects are
important,  and I'll have a good start on what to write next time. Unless
you want to hear more about me...........Naa!

Until next time,
KEEP MAKING' MUSIC!!"""|

@{B}Charles Jefts, Games Editor@{UB}

My name is Charles Jefts. I have a Games Forum on Genie, and I love Amigas!
The first computer I ever came into contact with was a Commodore Vic 20. I
was only one, (1983), but I loved it. I would watch my dad write programs
in Basic into the late hours of the night. He made three games for me, and
I loved them.  Soon I grew older and moved on to bigger challenges. Some of
my favorites were Radar Rat Race and Kinder Comp. We had also purchased a
Commodore 64 in 1983, but I had previously paid it no attention. I soon
discovered the wonders of games such as Forbidden Forest and Aztec
Challenge, and found my calling. Over the course of the next five years, I
amassed 500+ C64 games. I lived a contented life. Suddenly, in 1989, my mom
agreed to let my dad get a new baby. It was a long ride to the Amiga Center.
I was filled with questions and there seemed to be excitement in the air. 
After three hours of riding through bumper-to-bumper traffic, we had finally
arrived.  Inside the store, I saw more computers than I had ever seen before.
Shortly, we were on our way home. I sat in the back with the new Amiga 500.
I was more occupied with the small box in my hands. It was the game Superman.
We finally arrived back at our house, and shortly the Amiga was up and
running.  My dad popped in the game. Suddenly a vivid Superman logo, rich
in color, and smooth in texture, popped up on the screen. I had never seen
anything so beautiful! I quickly went out and bought seven more games, and
by the end of the month, I was on my way to having a hundred. I played the
Amiga every day for hours at a time. I often spent entire days in the summer
playing such games as It Came from the Desert. We added onto the 500 a lot.
One day we got a 386 PC. I found it's gaming capabilities to be merely
mediocre.  I preferred the Amiga over it any day. By 1993 I had moved on to
a Commodore CDTV. I was astonished by such games as Psycho Killer, and The
Labyrinth of Time. I had never experienced games so real. Next I got a CD32
and an SX-1. It is all I use today. As I see it, it is the ULTIMATE AMIGA
GAMING MACHINE! I love my CD32's, and will never part with them. To support
my excessive gaming habit, I got a gaming forum on Genie. This was mainly
done as an excuse to continue to buy games :). Now I sit around playing my
little games while the rest of the world raves about a computer who's OS
requires 64 times the memory of mine.

This correspondent pleads guilty....  of having communicated a lotof "doom
and gloom" over the past couple of Amiga years. It wasn't my intention to
be a "nattering nabob of negativism" ...just trying to communicate a
realistic view of the situation as Isaw it from my vantage point.

On reflection, the nadir was reached with the following commentfrom the Sam
Report of September 9, 1995:

@{I}"CEI's neighbor to the East on busy Flagler Street is a large cemetery.
I suspect that the Amiga (as a consumer computer in North America) was
buried there by Escom on April 21, 1995."@{UI}

As much as I hated to write that (and you hated to read it), subsequent
events confirmed the worst as Amiga Technologies fumbled in its valiant
attempt to revive the platform and Escomeventually went belly-up after
selling out to the highly dubiousViscorp. The interim illusions of promises
by such names asSMG, QuikPak, phase5, PIOS, etc. fell well short of
credibility.To some, even the old days of Commodore started to look good!

It is time now, my fellow Amigans, for a reality check. The glory days of
Babylon5, etc.  are long gone and anyone who readsthe video trade mags
knows that other, more sophisticated platforms have replaced the Amiga as
an industrial tool.   If wewere ever in the Major Leagues (debatable), we
are certainly now....buried deep in the Minors.

Gone are the good old days of the Tenax catalogs 4 times a year, the thick
Amiga Worlds with 7 page Creative Computer ads, gone are those fascinating
purple Grapevine offerings.  Gone is my beloved CEI next to the cemetery.
NewTek and Scala are PC people now.  Most ex-Amigans are PC people now!

So where are we in this so-called "reality check" ?  Certainlynot where we
used to be, or would like to be, but still alive! We've got our fine machines
that seem to last forever, we have all that great new industry-standard
hardware that easilyconfigures onto our aging boxes (Zip Drives, CDROMs,
etc.), wehave some software folks who (bless them) keep cranking outnew
things, we have firms like Software Hut and Safe Harbor whokeep hanging on,
we have the Europeans who seem to never say die,and lastly...  we have the
example of those tenacious C64 folkswhose example should be increasingly
relevant to us.

Bottom line....hang in there Amiga-guys. We still have a lotgoing for us
and...  who knows? ....a miracle could happen!

the Amiga today@{UI}

It's time to grow up folks. If the Amiga isn't dead already with these new
problems with Escom just before the deal with VIScorp is to be signed, it
will be dead if things continue as they have. The state of the Amiga can be
changed.  The owners just have to look at what Commodore did right and
realistically compare what they are offering to the current competition.

Commodore, long time reviled by Amiga owners due to their lackluster
support, did one thing very right.  They did the Commodore 64 (C64) right. 
It wasn't necessarily the best machine on the planet. It's OS was poor, it's
BASIC was primitive, it's drive access was slow, and it's expansion was
limited.  What it did have was color graphics, 3 voice synthesized sound,
and 64k RAM.  None of the low cost computers and few to none of the high
cost computers of the time combined these features in one box as standard.

Meanwhile the price of the C64 was flying south as rapidly as possible. All
of these factors were presented to the public on TV and magazine ads. A
customer, once lured into the purchase, was greeted with a free issue of a
Commodore produced publication to bring them into the "family" and teach
the customer more about the machine than could ever be placed into the
manual. In every computer store the C64 owner was applauded for his/her
smart choice with walls of available software products from a myriad of
developers. From left field, Commodore broadsided both IBM and Apple and
captured the lions share of the home PC market. With the Amiga, Commodore
forgot almost every lesson to be learned from the C64 days.

The Amiga 500 was poised to be the next C64. It was very popular amongst
home users who didn't want the lackluster features of the MS-DOS PCs or the
high cost of the Macs of the day and its price was steadily falling. Then it
was pulled to make room for the Amiga 600 which was slightly better but more
expensive and less expandable than the 500 and consequently never caught on.
If the 500 had been allowed to take off, it would have been the driving
force behind the whole Amiga line. The high-end, so called "big box" Amigas
like the 2000 and 3000 would have provided the clear upgrade path for
low-end owners looking for more.  Meanwhile expanding the capabilities of
the high-end machines with money from the high volume sales of 500s would
steer the whole product line, the steady trickle of these advancements would
keep the low-end machines popular. This was never allowed to happen. It was
an easy enough lesson to learn. The C64 sales provided the ability for
Commodore to develop the Plus/4, C128, C65 and purchase and develop the
Amiga itself.  To resurrect the Amiga line as a successful product, Amiga
Technologies (AT) must learn this.

Could the current low-end Amiga become the next C64? I don't think so. The
Amiga 1200 is simply too dated to do this. The low end Amiga must be
upgraded to at least a 50MHz 68030, maybe even a 68040. Also, there is no
reason for the 4000 to be sold with a 68040 with the owner then having to
replace the processor board to put in the 68060 that should have been there
in the first place. With these high end CPUs, all with built in FPUs and
MMUs,  the OS could finally truly support virtual memory and all software
could properly support the 040 and 060 and floating point math. With these
advancements, developers could be brought back into the Amiga fold giving
us what we need most, software, software, and more software.

People have been known to say "if only I could go back...," and the typical
response is that you can't go back. This is true of time and space alike;
you can return to your childhood home 30 years down the line, but will it
ever be the same?

But a pervading question becomes: if I could go back, and so with the
foreknowledge and experience of my life so far, would I be able to, or for
that matter, try to change anything? And should I return @{I}without@{UI}
that knowledge, would there be any gain in simply re-experiencing life so
far? Surely that would leave me in the same situation in which I now find
myself, and from which I clearly wish to escape, at least temporarily.

Let's take a look back to 1985. President Ronald Reagan's second US
administration was in full swing, Japan was embarrassing the US in the
automobile markets, progressive rock was falling out of favor with pop
culture-oriented youth, and the Amiga had just been introduced. This, of
course, only a few years after the IBM PC and Macintosh, respectively, had
been developed.  The microcomputer industry, although not new, was in its
fledgling stages at least as far as mass markets -- and comsumer-oriented
products, for that matter -- were concerned. Commodore took the Amiga under
its wing, and took the computer world by surprise. Here was a computer with
a multitasking operating system, graphical user interface, amazing animation,
4096 colors, and versatile video capabilities, all for a good deal less
money than most other systems that couldn't even begin to compare in
capability; but there's no need to retell this story, for you've all heard
it enough times.

For a time, the entire computer industry was at least aware of the Amiga,
if not impressed by it. It had experienced a strong start, only to be
followed by relatively weak growth. It began to become ob-vious that
Commodore was extremely hesitant to aggressively push their star product,
but riding on the momentum of its introduction, the Amiga continued to move
forward somewhat. In 1987, the Amiga industry began to show more promise
with the introduction of the A500 and A2000, but still Commodore did not
market effectively.

The saga, of course, continues up through present day. The A3000 was a
brilliant product, but its potential success was severely stunted. The same
occurred in 1992 with the onset of AGA. Yet riding on the shoulders of its
past and on the committment and support of the Amiga community, and
bolstered by Newtek's explosion into the desktop and professional video
industry, the Amiga some-how continued to survive.

So where does that leave us today? More or less with a 4-year technological
deficit in the wake of Commodore's illness (more the final onslaught of a
chronic disease than a sudden infection) and quick death, which not only
took its toll as any such disruption of the business cycle would, but also
in the extended fashion caused by the legal wrangling over Commodore's
assets, and continued by what many people judge to be a gross
misinterpretation of the Amiga industry by ESCOM; further, today, we find
ourselves plunging into yet another abyss, at the end of which may exist...
what? A final chance at true success for the Amiga, or that which all
"efforts" so far have not been able to attain: the ultimate destruction of
the Amiga, and the dream on which it stands.

But if you take a look back to 1987, you see a good era for the Amiga...or
at least comparatively so. It wasn't difficult to find Amiga dealers, or
user groups, for that matter. Resources were at hand, and you could actually
use them, even if you had problems or questions. Programmers and hardware
designers alike were frequently breaking new ground.  Few people questioned
the Amiga's potential or capability. People were enthralled with the power
and convenience of the Deluxe Paint series; F/A-18 Interceptor dispelled any
doubts of the Amiga's graphics, sound, and processing power; Word Perfect
for the Amiga showed that the Amiga stirred legitimate interest in other
segments of the computer industry.  And today...? Well, Deluxe Paint V (not
to mention its competition) blows away its predecessors; games like Gloom
and Nemac are all the rave; Final Writer 5 and Wordworth 5 thoroughly show
up WP and anything else from the era. And at the same time, we our in our
time of greatest stress. It's interesting how much better, and how much
worse, some things can be. There was hope in 1987. Was it false hope? In
light of our current predicament(s), one might be compelled to say "Uh...
yeah, somehow I think so." But without any certain knowledge of what is
coming next, we can't say for sure. It sure is hard to judge a book by its
cover, but even harder to judge a book by one of its chapters. In other
words, we can't see the whole story because we are acting it out. And the
drama continues...

I believe it was Cher who said something about what she'd do if she could
turn back time...well, we're mere mortals, last I checked, and we seem to
be fairly well confined to where we are now. Although the past may have
seemed more positive, it would most certainly lead right back to where we
are now.  We have been given a situation on which to act, and we have to
make the best of it.  The future is shrouded in mystery and fraught with
peril.  We aren't within the minds of the corporate executives, or the
engineers; we are, however, the users, the backbone of the entire community
and industry. For the Amiga to survive, we must have strength, determination,
and resources. It's going to take sincerity, and it's going to take
leadership. And it's going to take a united effort.

It is truly amazing that this platform has survived as long as it has, and
it is testimony to the incredible support of the community that has grown
around it. But this can only go so far. There's no question that we could
continue to survive as a group for some time, as evidenced by Commdore's
earlier ventures (C64 ,C128, and others), and Apple's stepping stone to the
Macintosh, the Apple II. It is no coincidence that the Roundtables on Genie
dedicated to those two platforms, in conjunction with the Starship Amiga
Roundtable, comprise some of the busiest areas on all of Genie. But I, and I
think many others as well, do NOT want THAT kind of a destiny. As far as
cutting edge computing is concerned, those other platforms, I am sorry to
say, are permanently out of the question.  But right now (and I emphasize
that this will NOT remain true forever, and we absolutely MUST end this
stagnant period if there is to be ANY hope), the Amiga fortunately remains
somewhat on a par with the IBM PC and Macintosh platforms, albeit in some
ways marginally.

It's STILL not too late.  We have survived so much opposition and so many
obstacles that it is all we know, and yet we continue to hold out hope.
Whatever you do, remember what this is, and what it stands for; always have
faith in your inspirations and aspirations.

We are so tenacious that we just won't give up the dream. And I hope we
never have to.

When Softwood introduced Final Writer a few years back, many people were
quite pleased.  No, this wasn't a case of "this product has promise;"it was
a case of "this is one great product right now!" Well, not&to leave well
enough alone, they introduced updates at fairly regular intervals,sometimes
tuning up little details, and other times, implementing major newfeatures
and design revisions.

All of this has culminated in Final Writer Release 5, introduced this spring.
This, of course, shortly after the release of version 5 of Final Writer's
greatest (perhaps only?) competitor, Digita's Wordworth, which also seemed
to gain a favorable reaction from the Amiga press. So Softwood had a lot to
live up to.

@{I}@{B}Upgrade time!@{UB}@{UI}


[Registered] owners of Softwood products have probably grown accustomed to
receiving notices in Final Writer-printed envelopes and documents in the
mail from time to time, either in the form of an announcement for the latest
Final Widget program, or an upgrade notice for a current one.  Not to knock
this; it is good to see a company that actually communicates with its
customers (it seems that, in the past, product registration cards were
sometimes bundled with products just as a matter of course). Well, the day
came in May when I found one such thing in my mailbox. Apparently Softwood
had once again defied the idea implied by the word "Final" and developed a
new&version of its program. In addition, they were offering several upgrade
options, with the program by itself, or bundled with the Windows 95 version
of the program (which they take great pains to point out was developed by
an independent group), or with a web site on Softwood's new web server.

So I wasted no time in calling the order number and requesting a copy of
Final Writer 5. No, I had to say, I don't have Windows 95 on my PC, and I
already have a web site; but they were pleased to send me Final Writer 5
nonetheless.

@{I}@{B}Installation@{UB}@{UI}

There's almost nothing to say here. Any competently-written Amiga program
these days is likely to be easy to install, largely because of the
ease-of-useand standardization brought with Commodore's Installer program. 
Final Writer held true to this standard, and its past precedents, in that
regard. The update came in the form of a 3-disk set to replace the previous
disks 1,8, and 9. Also included are explicit instructions for installing it.
You really can't go wrong. In terms of manuals, a "Final Writer Release 5
User Manual Addendum" is included which, incidentally, is significantly
thicker than the old Release 3 Addendum.

@{I}@{B}First Impressions@{UB}@{UI}

When Final Writer opens, the only difference you're likely to notice at
first is the screen title: "Final Writer - Release 5." The first-rate and
incredibly thorough graphical user interface remains fairly consistent with
Release 5. The improvements are more "internal."

What you are likely to notice quickly if you should happen to press the
right mouse button is that the menu layout has changed some what. There is
a new menu area labeled "Tables." "Font" has been added to "Layout." And
the "New," "Save," and "Open" items in the "File" menu have been changed
somewhat to provide greater versatility. We'll get into this in terms of
the new features.

@{I}@{B}What's new?@{UB}@{UI}

After all, people generally don't buy a program for a number that's
pinnedon it; they are interested in its capabilities.  Final Writer 5
introducesa number of new features and updates, so we will cover these
briefly (withoutechoing the manual addendum verbatim).
@{LINDENT 4}

*  @{B}"Select Font" requester@{UB}
FW5 makes this feature more convenient by giving it its own item in the
"Layout" menu.
*  @{B}Predefined zoom levels@{UB}
You can now select from several different zoom percentages from the "Zoom"
menu.
*  @{B}Styles enhancements@{UB}
There are several improvements to this aspect of Final Writer. For example,
styles can now be created "Based on" other styles, i.e. they start with the
same settings as the styles on which they are based. This makes it easier
to have relative, rather than absolute, differences in the structure of a
document. You can also set up an automatic style sequence, meaning that
when you end one paragraph and begin another, the program automatically
switches to the next specified style. There are several other enhancements
in this category.
*  @{B}Saving and opening preferences@{UB}
Thank you, Softwood! That's what I can hear many Amiga users saying right
now. You can now save multiple configurations with Final Writer, so if you
have several different preferred "operating modes," you can easily switch
between them.
*  @{B}Saving and opening style sheets@{UB}
Yes, yet another style enhancement! It's fairly well self-explanatory, and
goes along with the philosophy expressed by the above item.
*  @{B}Document templates@{UB}
This is another "modular" idea in FW5: it allows you to have certain
settings, and even text layouts, preset for different types of documents.
Examples include 2 each of Fax Cover, Letter, and Memo templates, and an
HTML template (to be explained further shortly...)
*  @{B}Auto Correct@{UB}
This is a new feature that goes further to help you write gooder...er,
better, methinks.  It actually adds several capabilities in one: (each of
these features can be disabled independently if you find them annoying, or
inappropriate for a particular document) Capitalize First Letter of
Sentences, Correct TWo INitial CApitals (yes, that's how it is displayed by
the program), and Replace Words as you type. This last one opens several
possibilities: first of all, if you are into the habit of typing "adn" and
"teh," it will remedy the situation. In addition, it makes it easier to
insert often-used phrases. For example, you can set it to replace "FW5"
with "Final Writer 5" or, as I do, "cm" with "103165.3700@compuserve.com."
*  @{B}GUI configurability@{UB}
The user interface is a bit more configurable, such as optional use of
various click tabs.
*  @{B}"Type Specs" accessibility@{UB}
You can now add "Type Specs" items to the User menu.
*  @{B}File requesters@{UB}
I don't fully understand this addition, and Softwood doesn't fully explain
it, but you can now set the program to use ASL requesters (for those who
don't know, these are the requesters displayed by almost every program
written in the last 6 years or so) instead of the custom ones which are, in
fact, quite similar. In fact, when I first got Final Writer Release 3, I
wasn't being particularly observant and mistook the file requesters for the
standard ASL variety. Basically, the difference is that ASL requesters
have keyboard shortcuts for navigating the directory structure, they have
menus that let you perform a variety of functions, and they can be resized.
Final Writer's requesters in no way violate the Amiga style guide, unless
you insist that all programs use the ASL requester, and in fact, many people
think they are a better match for Final Writer's GUI than the ASL ones...but
apparently, some people wanted ASL, so Softwood gave it to them.
*  @{B}Changing the order of sections@{UB}
You can now rearrange your sections.  Very nice.
*  @{B}Public Screen@{UB}
Final Writer 5's custom screen is now a public screen.  Plain and simple.
*  @{B}Preloading Fonts@{UB}
You can now set the program to automatically load particular fonts when it
first runs. Very nice.
*  @{B}Tables@{UB}
This is fairly self-explanatory. It is a feature that allows you to organize
data automatically into row/column cells. The tables also allow different
attributes to be set in different regions of the table. I'd call it a home
run for Softwood. The dimensions of the tables are automatically handled by
the program to accommodate what you type. There is a lot to say about Final
Writer's tables, far more than we can cover here. It is a powerful feature
with myriad powerful supporting capabilities.
*  @{B}RTF import and export@{UB}
This goes along with the modularization/standardization idea. You can now
save and load documents in the Rich Text Format supported by many word
processors on the other platforms.  You configure this feature by specifying
Final Writer fonts to map to the RTF fonts, basically in the form of a
translation table.
*  @{B}Datatype support@{UB}
Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Datatypes are among the most useful and
ingenious of the OS's capabilities, and unfortunately, have been both
grossly unused by applications, and grossly undeveloped by datatype
programmers. This addition to Final Writer allows you to import any image
format for which you have datatype support.
*  @{B}Grammar Correction System@{UB}
This major feature introduced in Release 4 has apparently been improved in a
number of ways, including performance. Softwood doesn't go into great detail
here, so neither will I.
*  @{B}HTML@{UB}
Very, very good, Softwood! They have followed clearly the growing importance
of the internet in recent years, particularly in reference to the WWW, and
as a result, have incorporated support for the creation of HTML documents
with Final Writer. This takes advantage of the Template feature mentioned
earlier so that is specifies various styles of HTML code. Any unsupported
features can be entered by the user in HTML itself. Exporting an HTML
document is done the same way as exportation of any other format, e.g. 
ASCII or RTF. To sum up the feature support, it allows for just about every
type style (normal, headline, blockquote, preformatted, etc....bold, italic,
underline, strikethrough, etc.). It allows images to be included just as
with normal Final Writer documents. There is a lot to be added. Basically,
it's a truly excellent idea, but it needs development. If you happen to be
reading the HTML version of this magazine, I wrote most of this document
using Final Writer 5 and the HTML export driver. There are also some
"quirks." I have created several HTML documents using Final Writer 5's HTML
export driver, and once (and once only), some inexplicable style attributes
and various other markups were inserted into the document, so that I had to
make little edits myself after exporting it. It was a case of  apparently
pressing one or more of FW's Bold/Italic/Underline buttons one too many
times.  It was a minor problem, but it was a throwback to the old
WordPerfect "Hidden Codes" days.  Despite such first version-deficiencies,
though, it does allow for easy layout of rudimentary HTML documents, and
could probably be carried to greater extents in future versions. Ironically,
the new "Table" feature introduced into the Final Writer side of the program
is not yet supported by the HTML side. Maybe this will change. Of course,
you can always embed native HTML code, if you're into those types of things.
*  @{B}Modified ARexx Comands@{UB}
Final Writer 5 has some modified ARexx commands, and some new ones,
generally in reference to the new features outlined above. The manual
addendum provides a thorough description.
@{LINDENT 0}

@{I}@{B}Results/Analysis@{UB}@{UI}

In conclusion, as a Final Writer user of several years, and as a writer for
this magazine, I give Final Writer 5 a high rating. Softwood has made a
number of significant improvements in their heavy-duty word processor, and
it's more user-friendly than ever. The new Table feature, and HTML export
driver, broaden the capabilities of an already wide-ranging program, and
the RTF capability can only aid Softwood's rapport with the word processing
community. We also mustn't forget how fortunate we are to still have
Softwood around. The last few years have been trying times, and many
companies have not survived them. But Softwood has stuck with us, and
continued to update their products. Despite how good this program is, there
are, however, several things that could be improved or added.
@{I}@{B}Suggestions for improvement@{UB}@{UI}

@{LINDENT 4}
*  @{B}Online Help!@{UB}
I can't emphasize this enough. The AmigaGuide hypertext online help system
has been grossly underused by Amiga applications. Even the workbench itself
is lacking this essential feature. It is unfortunate, because it is another
one of the truly useful parts of the OS. In MicroSoft Windows, just about
everything has an online help facility. Now, I'm not saying everything
including ShowConfig should be given an online help system; but surely
something as big as Final Writer should have one. The Amiga even has a help
key, for goodness sakes! It's ironic that Windows, having to use F1, has
gone so much farther in this direction. Programmers seem to have forgotten
about AmigaGuide. I'm not sure why Final Writer doesn't include an online
help system, but I can say it would be a very good addition to the program
in the next version.
*  @{B}Font previews@{UB}
Selection and usage of fonts could be made significantly easier if there was
a way to show a sample of a font within the requester.
*  @{B}Multiple alignments on one line@{UB}
Back, years ago, when I used WordPerfect for the Amiga, I remember
frequently using left-aligned and right-aligned text on the same line in
order to construct headings for school papers. Unless I have missed
something obvious, I have not found any way to do this with Final Writer,
or any other word processor, for that matter. I realize FW is a 
paragraph-oriented word processor, but it would be very convenient if it
allowed multiple justifications of text on one line.
*  @{B}Multitasking/multithreading/print spooling@{UB}
Now, there is no doubt that Final Writer is, in fact, multithreaded, and
that it multitasks with the system. So why am I mentioning this? It all
really comes down to printing. Once you begin to print a document, that
document window locks up, and control isn't returned until printing finishes.
Softwood, of course, had no choice but to write their own printing routines,
since the system's built-in print spooling capability was not designed with
outline fonts and Final Writer-style postscript-type printing in mind. But
it seems to me, then, that Final Writer should be designed with its own
centralized, modular printing system as long as the OS does not support that
capability. That way, a particular instance of Final Writer could call that
printing system, send it a document, and then get back to word processing.
As it is now, once you start printing, if you want to open a new document,
you must return to Workbench and run Final Writer again. Not a big deal,
but it could be made easier and more efficient. And have you ever opened a
print prefs requester from another FW doc whilst one is printing?
Interesting things happen.
If Softwood felt truly motivated, they could take their Final Writer
printing technology, and adapt it slightly so as to become a full-featured,
centralized print spooling system and postscript/graphic printing engine.
Then they could market that as an independent product that you could
actually purchase and install as an extension to the Amiga OS, where it
would be available to all programs seeking to use it.
*  @{B}Autoscroll Virtual Screen@{UB}
Final Writer should be able to open on an autoscroll virtual screen, just as
the Workbench can. It would be very convenient, especially for those of us
for whom resolutions higher than 640x480 are still a dream...
*  @{B}Iconification@{UB}
The ability to iconify to an AppIcon on the Workbench is a powerful feature
of the OS that is very much underused. It seems as though MUI Apps are the
only ones that use it fairly consistently. Final Writer should incorporate
this feature, so that its screen and other facilities could be shut down so
as to conserve memory, if the user wished to set it aside without actually
quitting the program.
*  @{B}AutoSave@{UB}
It is good that Final Writer does have facilities to automatically save
your work at certain preset intervals, but there's one flaw with them:
again, I refer back to the old Amiga WordPerfect. WP's autosave didn't save
the file to the name you had given it; it saved to a file in the T directory
(the one on disk, not in RAM:), and deleted it upon proper exit of the
program; but if WP ran and found that file in T, it would know something
had gone wrong, and recover it for you. Final Writer, and most other current
word processors, simply autosave right to the file from which they were
loaded, or to which they were saved. This is not as good as the other
method for several reasons: if the file doesn't yet exist, you'll be asked
for a name, and if you are viewing files (and not typing) and you happen to
inadvertently make a change in the file, it will be saved periodically. I
would prefer to have it saving to some otherwise meaningless file in a
scrap directory.
*  @{B}Datatype@{UB}
Currently, the only program that can view a file created with Final Writer
is Final Writer. Softwood should include a datatype with Final Writer so
that programs such as MultiView could read FW Documents; or if not that, at
least a file viewer for FW Docs, the way DPaint came with an animation
viewer. There should be no need to run a 1-megabyte program just to read a
file you wrote with it.
*  @{B}Key Shortcuts@{UB}
Final Writer has done a decent job with key shortcuts, especially with
default items (like "Print" and "Save" buttons) and user-configurable
aspects of the program, but this could be carried further, with shorcuts
for just about all functions and items in requesters. MUI and Windows have
done nicely in this respect, and although the Amiga is, and always shall be
(until the "next big input device revolution" if such an event occurs) a
primarily mouse-driven machine, key shortcuts can be extremely convenient,
and should be implemented more thoroughly into all programs, Final Writer
included.
*  @{B}Cancel Closing of Document@{UB}
When you click the close gadget on a document window, if it isn't saved, it
will ask you if you wish to Save, and  allows you to say "Yes," "No," or
"Cancel." If you say "No," then there is no going back. If it's the last
document, the program asks you if you want to exit..."Yes" and "No," but no
"Cancel." It is possible to make a mistake at the first requester. If the
user were allowed to "Cancel" the whole operation, then he or she would be
given one more chance to preserve unsaved work.
*  @{B}Set File Type@{UB}
For people who are frequently using Final Writer to edit documents other
than those of the Final Writer variety (i.e.  RTF, ASCII, or HTML), it
would be convenient if one could set the default file export type to
something other than the standard format in preferences. This is especially
so for people who wish to repeatedly make minor edits to files and save
them without having to go through all the requester options each time. In
this respect, the "ASL Requester" option is actually convenient, since it
asks you to set the file format before it opens the requester when saving.
But if the default option could be set, it would make things that much
easier.
*  @{B}@{I}Importing@{UI} Files@{UB}
Final Writer, at this time, cannot import HTML documents. They come up as
ASCII text. This would be a good capability to add in the future, since at
this time, creating an HTML document with Final Writer is a one-shot deal.
It is understandable, however, why Softwood would add the export without
import capabilty; there can be significant variation in HTML document
structure. It's meant that way...plus there is the issue of incomplete or
badly-coded HTML documents. So the HTML import driver would have to be
extremely versatile. But without going quite that far, they could at least
give the ability to import HTML documents created with the Final Writer HTML
export driver. At least in that case they could be certain of a continuity
in HTML coding. But then by adding a thorough HTML import driver, we could
be looking at full-featured web-browsing capability. Hmm...imagine it...
"Final Internet..." This whole idea certainly opens vast new gateways for
Final Writer. Integrated web-browsing abilty? Built-in email? Perhaps an
entirely new Softwood product package could emerge based upon this first
step into internet affairs.  Potentials abound!
*  @{B}HTML@{UB}
The HTML driver built into Final Writer 5 is an excellent idea. The growing
popularity of the internet (and the growing number of people with web
pages), in conjunction with Final Writer's long-standing history of being
an excellent page-layout program, practically mandated that, and Softwood
made a good decision. But as I mentioned, the current HTML driver is highly
limited, and a bit flaky. Don't think I'm denouncing it; it's a great idea,
and for that reason, is something that should be developed. Were Softwood
to iron out the bugs and quirks, and expand the capabilities to include all
the little HTML tricks and entities (tables, forms, links, protocols, etc.),
Final Writer could be transformed into a fully-graphical, full-featured,
and extremely easy-to-use HTML editor. Some current features of the DTP
side of the program could be "ported" to the HTML side, such as tables and
horizontal rules. At that, Final Writer could serve a multifaceted purpose
and attract a larger crowd.

One final interesting detail of note is that the date stamped on the
program in the "About..." menu item was AFTER the date I ordered it...;-)

Current Material?

Okay, so I'll be the first to admit that this isn't exactly a late-breaking
development. In fact, it's been around long enough for even the printed
magazines to have had their say on it. It's been floating around the
marketplace for the last half-year or so.

So why do we cover it now in an online magazine? Several reasons. First of
all, the technology is far from obsolete. Just because it's not brand new
doesn't mean it's totally useless. Amiga people, after all, should be
accustomed to accusations of obsolescence by now, and at least most of us
agree that the Amiga, although not having been updated significantly in
about 4 years, is still a competitive machine for a variety of reasons. So
in the same sense, the 135mb EZ Drive still has a lot to offer.

The Price Roller Coaster

I have been using a SyQuest EZ135 now since the end of 1995. I bought it
simply because I was looking for a convenient way to both expand my storage
capabilities (since this drive is 15mb bigger than my internal HD) and back
up my data, since electrical problems had brought a rash of disk
invalidations. It cost in the range of $300 at the time for an external SCSI
model. Well, things have changed. This drive can now be had for as little as
$95 and usually no more than $120.

Why such a drop? No, SyQuest didn't commit a vast mathematical error. (hey,
whatever happened to that pentium fiasco...?) Well, you may know about
IOMega and their Zip Drive. It's probably safe to assume that the EZ135
was designed to be a Zip killer. Somewhat similar in implementation, the two
varied starkly in specifications, generally in favor of the EZ Drive.

The wheels of industry never stop turning, though, and since that time, both
companies have been busily working on new designs. Both companies have
recently introduced or announced new models with improved specifications,
notably higher storage capacities. The result? The older ones go for
super-cheap!

"A Drive of Destiny"

There's no question that removable-media storage devices have been around
for some time. The old tape drives, and floppy disk drives, have always fit
this description. But in terms of hard disks, even they have been around in
removable form for a time. SyQuest is certainly one of the names that comes
to mind when one considers this heritage. Well, the trend in computers these
days has obviously been to make everything easier on the user, as evidenced
by advances in multitasking, Graphical User Interfaces, Plug & PLAY (OR PLUG
& PRAY AS IT IS IN SOME CASES...), AND THE development of the World Wide Web
as a whole to give the internet a pretty face. Hey, only 20 years ago any
computer was deemed (by the uninitiated) the domain of only techno-geeks
and university students and professors with way too much time on their hands.
And today...? Well, you get what I mean. So hardware manufacturers are
trying to go after the multitudes of computer users who are looking for
easy, quick, low-cost storage devices.

The EZ and Zip are both evidence of this. Both of them have stylish cases
rather than "a box." Both are, presumably, easy to set up and use. Both
are...yes, they are very similar, aren't they?

EZ Drive Inside and Out

The test machine, in this case, was an Amiga A500/GVP A530 Turbo with
AmigaDOS 3.1.  The SCSI Controller is a 16-bit SCSI-II device.

Physically setting up the drive was extremely easy. I only had to plug the
included SCSI cable into the back of the A530, and put the included
terminating resistor pack into the back of the EZ Drive. You can set the
SCSI device number with by poking a pen tip into little scrolling arrow
buttons on the back. Upon startup, I was pleased to discover that the
computer recognized the existence of the drive. So the next step was to get
one of the 135mb cartridges ready to use with the system. To do this, I
used the GVPSCSI software, which shows that the drive is not the least bit
software-specific. It's a good thing, because there is no Amiga software
support included with the EZDrive.

It's almost a pity I had to format the cartridge, because it says there are
all sorts of great utilities on it...if you happen to own a Mac. Well, that
procedure went painlessly, so the next thing I did was actually try out the
drive.

As I mentioned, I was interested in finding a way to easily back up my
internal hard disk.  The EZDrive would presumably make that process very
simple, because of its having a slightly larger storage capacity than the
internal HD. So I started by dragging the System3.1 partition icon into
the EZDrive. At first, all seemed to go well, but then the system reported
a very strange error number and told me that it had encountered an
unexpected SCSI state. Well, fortunately it occurred to me to fiddle with
the SCSI settings, which solved the problem. There is a warning somewhere
in the GVP manual about SyQuest drives not being able to sustain synchronous
transfers, so I assumed that was the reasonable explanation, or if not, a
suggestion of a reasonable explanation. In case you're wondering, the SCSI
settings I'm using that work perfectly are the following:
@{LINDENT 4}

*  Last Disk
*  Last LUN
*  NOT Disconnect
@{LINDENT 0}


From that point on, the drive worked perfectly.

Testing on a 16-bit Machine

Although the GVP A530 Turbo contains a 68030, the SCSI controller is 16-bit,
and I thought it would be interesting to see how it performed under those
circumstances, since most tests so far have been performed on higher-powered
machines. Subjectively, I found the performance to be exemplary; SysInfo
reported the EZDrive to transfer data at around 1.11mb/second. For
comparison's sake, my 120mb internal Quantum drive is rated by SysInfo to
be around 1.13mb/second. Very admirable results, for a removable disk to
come that close to equalling the speed of a fixed disk.

Complaints

Well, no, not really! I have no problem with this drive whatsoever, with the
single exception, perhaps, that SyQuest does not offer Amiga support. Some
people complain about the EZ Drive's eject mechanism which is characteristic
of earlier SyQuest drives. I'd have to say that's a matter of personal
opinion, because it certainly doesn't bother me. It seems to be a great
drive, and I eagerly anticipate news of their next advance in this field.

Results

All things considered, the SyQuest EZ135 Drive would become a worthy member
of your SCSI bus. This was certainly the case before, but even more so now,
when the price has absolutely plummeted to around $100. It's a fast little
drive with a very decent capacity, and more than serves its purpose
adequately.

VMM is a virtual memory manager for any Amiga with Workbench 2.x and up, MUI
or BGUI, and a Memory Management Unit.

First, what is virtual memory. Virtual Memory (VM) is hard drive space that
is set up to supplement your available RAM by allowing the computer to "page
out" items from RAM that it is not using to the hard drive. That RAM is now
free to be utilized by the system. This does slow down the system due to the
slower speed of the hard drive com-pared to RAM chips but it does allow you
to load larger files than you can with the RAM you can afford to purchase.
This feature has long been available to the Windows and Macintosh crowd
directly through their operating system. The Amiga, since its operating
system has long been based on the 68000, has not had this feature built in
so it must be added by others. The 68000 can not utilize a virtual memory
system since it has no Memory Management Unit (MMU). This is the chip
responsible for moving the memory "pages" from RAM to the hard drive and
back. Motorola added an MMU as an option to the 68020 CPU in the form of a
separate chip that board manufacturers could add if they chose called the
68851. Most 68020 accelerator manufacturers left this chip out since the
Amiga did not support virtual memory directly and it would have added to the
cost of the board. Commodore included it on the A2620 accelerator (this is
the one I tested VMM on). Processors from the 68030 up have included the MMU
internally (excluding the 680EC30). To determine whether or not you have an
MMU, you need only use a program like ShowConfig or SysInfo. If you have a
68040 or 68060 you definately have an MMU.

@{I}@{B}Installation@{UB}@{UI}

Installation of VMM is easy through the installer script (Amiga Technologies
released a new version of Commodores Installer utility; be sure to pick that
up also). Here you pick where VMM and its components will be located (Keep
in mind that the Installation script will not automatically create a
directory for VMM). You also need to tell VMM whether to to use 4k or 8k
pages. This is the size of the pieces of RAM that VMM will move around. The
installer will tell you if you can use the smaller 4k pages on your system.

@{I}@{B}First Impressions@{UB}@{UI}

When you run VMM you will be greeted with the preferences which requires
either MUI or BGUI (two user interface libraries available separately on
Aminet. Here you tell VMM how large and where you want the page-file (the
area on your hard drive that the pages of RAM will be placed) to be. It can
either be a file on a hard drive, a whole partition, or a psuedo-partition.
Utilizing a partition for the swap space is the fastest method while using a
file is the most flexible. The psuedo-partition combines the best of both
meth-ods but requires a bit of set-up. With using a file, you can set the
size of the virtual memory space (up to 512 Megs) using a slider. VMM then
creates the file when you save the settings. Another area of the preferences
is the tasks list. With this list you can have VMM exclude from swapping
programs that react violently to it. It comes pre-setup for Art Department
Pro. One option that doesn't seem to work on my system is the emulation of
Chip RAM. You can set VMM to emulate only Chip RAM, only Fast RAM, or an
option called ANY. On my system, an Amiga 2500/020 running Workbench 2.1, it
emulates Fast RAM no matter what this is set at.

@{I}@{B}Results/Analysis@{UB}@{UI}

If you do graphics with your Amiga and have limited funds, this utility is a
must. Up to and including version 3.2, VMM had a tendency to be crash-prone.
 With version 3.3, the program has become completely stable.

*  @{B}Fixing virtual Chip RAM@{UB}
On neither test bed machine, an Amiga 2500/020 (OS2.1) or an Amiga 1200/030
(OS 3.1), did the setting of VMM to emulate Chip RAM seem to work. The new
memory always comes up as Fast RAM. Just imagine an Amiga with up to 512
Megs of virtual Chip memory.
*  @{B}Make this part of the Operating System@{UB}
This is a feature that should be available to every Amiga owner. This
program already seems to adhere perfectly to the Amigas OS both from its
Preferences program to its being a Commodity. Even with RAM prices falling
lately, you can never have enough memory.

@{I}How It All Got Started@{UI}

Certainly, most people who have been involved with Amigas for any number of
years remember that there has been a long-standing focus on games. When new,
the Amiga had previously unheard-of multimedia (well before the term was so
thoroughly hyped) capabilities. Although the Amiga also had significant
power as a business or home computer, Commodore couldn't seem to shake the
notion that the Amiga was a games machine. Certainly pulling your A500 out
of the closet and hooking it up to a TV wasn't unlike what many people had 
been doing a number of years earlier with their Atari consoles; but
certainly a "box" like the A1000 or a "big box" like the A2000 wasn't so
convenient for carting around. It got to the point where some naysayers
declared the CD32 to be Commodore's downfall, in effect a blatant admission
to the long-standing accusations. Well, the myths perpetuated...and in the
meantime, the Amiga thrived on it; as many people discovered, a machine that
could play serious games could also run serious multimedia software.

But as it turned out, professionals and amateurs alike would often close
their Video, Rendering, Word Processing, Music, or DTP app at the end of the
day, and pull out a copy of their favorite game. The gaming experience has
always been a part of the Amiga's legacy. Today, the same people who once
criticized the Amiga (perhaps more out of jealousy than legitimate disdain)
for being a "Games Machine" are out buying Mega-Pentium Windows-Monger
PC's...maybe for their work, but in many cases an ulterior motive is to
play the latest polygon-cranking 3d free scrolling virtual reality thingie
at a tolerable speed.

Now, the current batch of Amigas may balk a little at the notion of running
Quake or Descent in 640x480 pixels with full 24-bit color, but they are
clearly holding up remarkably well, evidenced by a continuing flood of new
games, both commercial and public domain. Charles Jefts, our Games Editor,
will be exploring this in greater depth in future issues...but for now,
we're looking back -- back to when less was more, when we thought our older
Amigas were unquestionably the hottest machines around for playing
heavy-duty game software. And they were.

@{I}The Hardware@{UI}

It's remarkable to think how much has changed.  How much, for instance, the 
68030 outstrips the 68000. And it is remarkable to consider how our
perceptions have changed. How, for instance, a 68030 is considered an
absolute minimum for a good lot of software. Well, regardless of how far
current technology is ahead of 1985's, we should remember that the Amiga
was truly top-of-the-line at the time. It was a finely-tuned machine with
the very latest in a lot of technology, at least at the consumer level.

Yes, the 68000 had been around since the late 1970's...in mainframes...and
had been introduced in the Macintosh a year earlier. The whole concept of
coprocessors, however, was relatively new to this field of computing. Notice
that the Amiga was equipped with several coprocessors right off the bat,
although we sometimes hesitate to think of them as such. The copper is by
name and function a coprocessor, although it has shown up most often in the
unimpressive (at least today) role of letting you drag one screen down in
order to see the one behind it. The blitter, by definition a DMA apparatus,
had truly awesome coprocessing power. The 68000 was the top of the line in
such a market, and here were two pieces of hardware that could run circles
around it for certain tasks, particularly in reference to graphics,
video,...and games. There were, of couse, a number of other pieces of
hardware that also processed various forms of data concurrently to the CPU,
including sound, video output, disk and serial I/O...

The general idea was that no matter how much things have changed, the Amiga
was built for ultimate speed and efficiency. It was more finely-tuned than
just about any machine on the market, even today...and THAT is what truly
gave it its edge for playing high-powered games -- and also part of the
reason why it continues to survive despite having gone so long with no
development.

@{I}The System Software@{UI}

People can say that the 680x0 series isn't keeping up with the 80x86 series
(which isn't really true yet...the 68060 is no dog), and the the current
custom chipset is not keeping up, but critics tread lightly around the
Amiga's OS. It was designed from the ground up to be multitasking and
user-friendly, not to mention fast and efficient. In addition, it has only
gotten faster, more efficient, and more powerful as it has matured. Those
two things together cannot be said of any other platform. It was designed
to use as little memory as possible, to provide as powerful an environment
for software to run as possible, and to make it as easy and convenient as
possible for the user to access it. And while Amiga OS 3.1 may not quite
run on a 256K Amiga 1000, it comes a lot closer than Windows 95 to doing so.

Isn't it wonderful how advances in computing always end up trickling down to
the games market? Well, everything that made AmigaDOS so ideal for running
the latest in powerful applications also made it great for running games.
The multitasking enabled one process to launch a whole set of others to
handle various tasks smoothly...and there's a lot going on in a game. On the
other hand, AmigaDOS could be totally disabled for complete access to the
computer's awesome hardware (although this ability was unfortunately used
WAY too much by early game programmers).

But AmigaDOS provided quite a bit to any programmers, particularly games
ones. Libraries of graphics, video, and sound routines simplified and
standardized such functions. Today, we may consider what was there to be
insufficient, but taken in the light of the standards available at the time
(and up through very recent times, in fact) it is quite impressive.

@{I}The Games@{UI}

Amiga game developers reached many milestones in the early years in the
areas of 3D games (particularly flight sims...yes, there WAS 3D before Doom
if anybody remembers), role-playing games, and arcade classics (with some
newer arcade hits too). Shoot 'em ups, driving games, chess games...the list
goes on. Anybody who was involved with the Amiga community at the time is
likely to have run across a number of such games.

Well, I've been around here since 1987, and have collected somewhat of a
games arsenal over the years. Many of them won't run on my Amiga in its
current state, but I with DKB's MultiStart II board, I can go between Amiga
OS 3.1 and AmigaDOS 1.3 at will.

Over the next few months, I will be using this introduction as a
springboard, and will "review" some older Amiga gaming classics. It will
allow us to relive the "Good Old Days" somewhat, and to re-experience the
excitement and enthusiasm of such times.

In times of desperation, you can look upon the past for inspiration. If we
are to move forward, we must remember, and value, everything that brought us
to where we are now.

And who knows...you may be surprised to recall just how good the games
were...

Remember when people said that you simply couldn't do a texture mapped
dungeongame like Doom? Now we can't seem to get away from them. To the list
which includesGloom, Breathless, Nemac IV, and Alien Breed 3D must be added
Trapped. What this one offers that is different is that it gives up the guns
and grenades for swords and magic.

This demo can be obtained from Aminet in the games/demos directory as
TrappedJune.LHA or with the new Grafitti chunky graphics card. You start out
by selectingone of the four supplied characters to fit your playing style.
Each has differing statistics. You then start in Level 3 with sword in hand.
By pressing the F8 key you have controlover the game parameters in the
options screen. You can lower the graphics complexityof the game to increase
performance for slower Amigas or, if you have a 50MHz 68030 or above, you
can have all the bells and whistles. The player is helped through this by
being able to select presets based on processor type. You have control over
the audio filter, the size of the play screen, the relative brightness and
the displaying of floor/ceiling textures and lens flares.

One of the impressive and troubling features of this game are that as your
characterwalks aroung the dungeon, you are treated with realistic animated
lens flares, assumingyou did not turn them off in the options. These
brighten as you approach any light source and move as your character turns.
The problem is that they also often appeareven for light sources that are
not quite visible. These ghost lens flares are easy to confuse for an
approaching enemy until you get used to them. Still, they are unique on the
Amiga to this game.

The next problem I have with this game is the combat. After striking at your
enemy,a hand icon becomes ghosted for short period of time where you cannot
strike again. I personally prefer quick action and often find myself
frustratedly pressing my left mouse button, my character getting pummelled,
while waiting to be able to hit again.

There, with those out of the way I can tell you more about the game. It runs
at largest in about 3/4 of the screen with the rest showing you status
information about your character and weapons. There are potions to increase
your health and spells to damage oponents, all available from the keyboard,
assuming you have any in your inventory.On my 50 MHz 68030 this game runs as
smooth as silk at full complexity and screen size. The game also supports
OCS/EGS/AGA and the new Graffiti graphics card.

@{I}@{B}Installation@{UB}@{UI}

Decompress the game to a directory. Boot up your machine in PAL mode if it
isn't inthat mode already. Read the readme file. Play the game.

@{I}@{B}Results/Analysis@{UB}@{UI}

This game is a real diamond in the rough. It looks good, plays fast and
smooth and allows you to configure it to slower machines for the enjoyment
of nearly all Amiga owners. The inclusion of support for OCS/ECS Amigas is a
real suprise treat.

YAY! Trapped August demo was just released today (07/31/96). It has more
ambiance. Your footsteps echo, you can use the cursor keys to move,
including backward! There are new, bettertextures for the walls and some
rooms now have objects in them.  Add 10% to controls, 10% to playability,
5% to graphics and 5% to the sound percentages below, giving Trapped August
Demo a total of 88.3%. The only thing left is the phantom lens flares, but I
can live with that.

Movement is effected by moving the mouse left/right and pressing the right
button for forward. Since the left button is for attack there is no reverse
which would be a real help in combat situations.
