--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bill McEwen answers to a posting from John Wiederhirn on comp.sys.amiga.misc

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding message from J.F. Wiederhirn,

There are some valid points, but you overemphasise the points significantly. The
extent to which you dismiss the platform is at odds with the reality of the
graphics and Java performance [for example].

You cannot direct register usage, just as you can't in C. So really you are
saying that you cannot write as efficient code in VP as you can by hand-crafting
native assembler. This is undeniably true and nobody pretended otherwise. VP
does give you, however, a means of writing low-level code, sacrificing the
minimum of efficiency possible with a portable solution. For ultimate
performance, certain operations would need to be written in native but when you
don't do this, you still get near-optimal performance in a portable manner.

As it happens, they are saved.

The CPU documentation details which native registers are used by the VP
environment. Development of PII tools such as the first level interrupt handler
is directly based on that information. For example, sys/cii/arm6/cpu.html gives
the information about native register usage for anyone wishing to write an ARM
PII.

   > The VP in the SDK does not appear to support any mechanism for issuing MMX
   > or SSE instructions.

To get ultimate performance you would need to abstract at a library level and
develop native MMX-based implementations. So MMX type instructions can be used
now. They have not been abstracted into VP as there is no sufficiently common
model across all processors with MMX-type operations to get any degree of
efficiency. However, as noted in this paragraph already, an application that can
make good use of these instructions on a particular processor can contain some
native tools containing the MMX type instructions for that particular processor.
These tools can be macro-ised and embedded to get code that looks and behaves
like the MMX instructions were fully supported.

Would you suggest an abstraction that could be used? You obviously have some
good ideas in mind for you to have made such comments.

Cache? Hi!

This is not a VP issue at all. Do any processors have native instruction
modifiers that allow cache usage to be modified on a per instruction basis? I do
not know of any. I would have thought that most of this work will be by
programming a CPU register(s) to control the cache usage (i.e. coarse: turn off
at start - turn on at end for all memory operations on a memory bank. fine:
declare a pointer type to be uncached so that any use of that pointer is not
cached.). Note that in your question 4 there is a reference to declaring a
memory area as cached or not cached, so that is the level of cache management
expected. So, that is clearly not a VP issue. In fact, intent is uniquely placed
to take advantage of an architecture where cache lines are controlled by
individual flags within the pointer. The trouble is, again, there is no good
abstraction for this concept. It is up to individual platforms and drivers to
have these concepts defined and used if required. And this is all perfectly
possible on intent. An example might be that two memory objects are declared,
one returns cached memory, one not cached. These can even allocate from the same
underlying pool, although you are likely to find that the cache is turned off
and on at larger boundaries than the byte.

The kernel and tool loaders are cache aware in that they call
sys/cii/flushicache during tool loading and code relocation to allow a platform
to clean/flush caches if required. Although this is a CII tool, it is actually
implemented in the PII since cache details may differ on platforms with
apparently similar cores. The tool is directly accessible to device drivers if
developers wish to use it. Where DMA and cache interaction is an issue, the PII
implementer would write tools for the device driver writer to use to e.g.
clean/writeback a DCache.

The whole point of the PII is that there is a fixed set of tools required by the
OS on all platforms plus a "platform specific" optional set that need to be
written to address specific issues on the target platform. This maintains the
portability and encapsulates the "dirty stuff" in one layer. PIIs have
successfully been implemented on many platforms with caches and "take advantage"
of the cache just like any software.

The cacheing issue has already been covered. Any other attributes fall into the
same category. Have you come across write-combined/non-write-combined? Even if
these exist, it wouldn't really change anything. If a need is identified,
functions can easily be added to the PII. It has been constructed to be
extensible.

The primary focus for intent has been on embedded systems where the MMU is used
to set up a fairly simple memory space with mostly 1:1 translation from physical
to virtual space. These mappings are set up at boot time. The mapping tools you
refer to were developed several years ago for the DOS platform and are not used
on any other platform.

This isn't true. JNI is not portably defined across platforms. I don't see
really what the complaint is here.

I expect here you are commenting on the efficiency of the interrupt handing
model. Not altogether a surprise, if someone's obsessed by these issues.

There is nothing wrong with the interrupt model for 'normal' usage platforms.
Those who are obsessed are at liberty to fit in their own architecture here.
Platforms with little hardware support for devices may also need to do the same
thing to be able to service interrupts at a very low patency. The intent model
does not precluse this at all.

Some things are undeniably true, nonetheless. The 2D graphics functionality and
performance is unparalleled. This is all done in VP. It shows that using this
technology it is possible to develop highly performing portable software (near
optimal, not completely optimal on all architectures). The JVM and libraries are
still be best available. It is true that the superiority of the technology is
greatest in embedded space but to suggest that it is worthless is not realistic.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that it is impossible to refute bland
allegations that do not give any substance.

                            AMICOMSYS 1.33 RELEASED!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Håkan Parting <hakan\@parting.nu>

Hello,

AmiComSys 1.33 is released today.

*Recent changes:*

   - NEW: Now play full samples if sound.datatype version 40 or better is
     installed. If not it still plays maximum 1.8 seconds.
   - BUG: It didn't work to connect with SendFile to a computer in the internal
     network from the Internet router, i.e. the computer having the actual
     Internet connection. Reverse it did work and PChat worked both directions.
     Outside your network there were no problems to connect to your computer.
     To make it possible for computers on Internet to connect with PChat and
     SendFile to your computer which has an internal network ip address, i.e.
     is behind a firewall or Internet router you have to enable the "I'm behind
     a firewall" checkbox in the AmiComSys network settings.
     It still isn't possible to connect with PChat and SendFile between two
     machines both having only an internal ip-address, i.e. when the Internet
     router isn't involved. This is a feature for AmiComSys 2.0 which still is
     in development.

*Availability:*

It may be downloaded at http://www.parting.nu/ACS/ and
http://surf.to/AmiComSys/.

It will also be available on Aminet in comm/net/AmiComSys.lha in a few days.

@node not05 "MAKECD V3.2D PUBLIC BETA AVAILABLE"
                       MAKECD V3.2D PUBLIC BETA AVAILABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Patrick Ohly

Hello!

Today I have uploaded a public beta of MakeCD V3.2d to http://makecd.core.de/.
It is not the next release as it still requires the V3.2c archive and won't be
available anywhere else yet (e.g. not via the release binary mailing list). It
also has to be regarded as beta, although it went through a thorough closed beta
test.

I announce this beta version here, because it adds some features eagerly awaited
by quite some people: support for recent Sony drives and DAO for ATAPI drives.
Have fun! :-)

Here are the details:

   - Added raw writing (aka ATAPI DAO) to the CDR_SCSI3_ATAPI.driver; now all
     modern drives should be supported in both TAO and DAO.
     MakeCD recognizes which mode is used by a drive and uses cue-sheet-DAO if
     possible, because it does not require raw data and allows to fixate only
     the session. (look at the drive properties to find out if the
     CDR_SCSI3_ATAPI.driver only supports raw data in DAO for your drive; then
     it is limited to raw writing).
     You can force MakeCD to use raw writing by adding MAKECD_RAW_WRITING to the
     tooltypes.
   - move to the correct position in an image file before starting to write;
     helps to avoid buffer underruns with FFS, a small buffer and files like
     AIFF-CD, where the reading position is very far away from the beginning
   - several workarounds for Sony and recent HP drives; DAO now works with e.g.
     CRX140S. MakeCD now uses a different command order when initializing for
     DAO writing - try MAKECD_OLD_DAO if you use the CDR_SCSI3_ATAPI.driver and
     DAO writing stops working with this version of MakeCD.
   - added recognition of Teac CR-R58S, Yamaha CRW8424E/S, Ricoh MP7060S,
     Plextor PX-W124TS, Plextor PX-W1210A, Sony CRX100E, Sony CRX140S, Mitsumi
     CR-4804TE, Cyberdrive CDRW602, HP CD-Writer+ 9100/9300; I have been told
     that the CR-4804TE does no longer require a delay after fixation to avoid
     crashes after firmware 2.6, so you may try adding
     "MAKECD_MITSUMI_FIX_DELAY=0" in you tooltypes.
   - Burn Proof writing can be enabled by setting MAKECD_BURN_PROOF in the
     tooltypes or as an environment variable. Only some 12x recorder support
     this; otherwise MakeCD will not use this mode and indicate this by adding
     "Burn Proof not supported" to the log.
     Burn Proof is a mode developed by Sanyo that tries to avoid buffer
     underruns by restarting burning as close as possible to the position where
     writing stopped.
   - try to enable high speed mode of 12x writers by setting one vendor specific
     bit
   - bugfix: 12x writing in DAO was only enabled when explicitely asking for it,
     but not when using "0" for maximum speed
   - GUI: when appending audio image files that need a target image file (i.e.
     when reading mp3), then the target file format is taken from the current
     track or the last saved gadget state.

Known problems:

   - Sony (and thus probably some HP drives) don't allow "Session Fixation" in
     DAO if at least one track is a data track. Use "Disc Fixation" if you get
     SCSI errors before writing starts. Also writing in DAO to a non-empty disc
     doesn't seem to be supported. Use TAO instead.
   - Some ATAPI drives cannot handle large chunks, e.g. the HP 9310i crashes
     when chunks larger than 128KB are used. Use smaller chunks, 64KB should be
     safe.

Bye, Patrick Ohly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Alex

Hello,

as this list is almost dead for a while now, I'm shutting it down - don't answer
to this message on the list, and don't post further mails to the list, when you
read this message the "aos35" most likely doesn't exist anymore!

Anyone interested in Amiga OS 3.5 should send a message to majordomo\@amiga.com
with "subscribe os35list" in the message body to subscribe to the newly started
official mailinglist (if you haven't done so already).

As I'm concentrating on making music at the moment, I'm looking for someone
capable and interested enough to take over my "inofficial" Amiga OS 3.5 FAQ.
Anyone out there please send me a private mail.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This update fixes some annoying bugs in the original release of Heretic II. The
following things changed:

   - In the original version saving the game did cause a crash at some places
     under certain circumstances (for example Andoria Plaza), this is now
     fixed.
   - Some people had problems with the CD-ROM code. This is fixed.
   - Some people could only start the game every second time. This is fixed.
   - Some people experienced delays having to do with the CD-ROM code sometimes.
     This is fixed.
   - In the ref_gl.dll a debug output was remaining, which caused slowdowns in
     some scenes. This was removed.
   - Updated Heretic II Troubleshooting and Tweaking document. For more detailed
     information please refer to the documentation included in the download.

At this place we also want to announce, that a port of the Multiplayer-Addon
"The Siege" of Heretic II is in progress. At this place we want to thank the
author of The Siege (The ShadowLord) for doing an Amiga Version. You can find

                            UPDATES FROM GARY PEAKE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Gary Peake <gary\@amiga.com>

Sorry for the delay in posting any updates here. I have just returned from a
2500 plus mile trip in a Rental truck (24 footer) dragging my family and a 3
bedroom house full of furniture to Snoqualmie from Texas.

If I missed any posts, please feel free to send them my way.

   - Ports

If possible, can anyone currently porting an app or utility or whatever please
send me an email? I would like to establish an online database for registered
developers so these apps can be listed and thus avoid any duplications that may
take place.

I would also like to announce that Douglas McLaughlin will be writing his own
version of ICQ for the new AmiVerse.

   - License Fees

Contrary to what the SDK says, there will be NO license fees on any
applications, tools, or ports in the year 2000. We are reviewing this policy for
2001 and beyond and as soon as I have the info I will post it here.

Also, there is and never will be license fees on open source apps or tools.

   - Developer Web Site

Sorry about the delay with the web site. Part of the delay was waiting to see
which ways we would go with certain web based applications and another part of
the delay has been getting my family situation worked out and all of my family
up here to the great Northwest.

That accomplished, the web site updates will begin in earnest now. Stay tuned
for more developments there.

Thanks for your patience.

@node not11 "AMIGA RESPONDS TO COMMUNITY CONCERNS"
                      AMIGA RESPONDS TO COMMUNITY CONCERNS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are very excited at the response that we have received in the first few weeks
of the Amiga SDK version 1 going out into the world. We have received lots of
feedback, mostly good, some not so good, and three particular points have come
up that we would like to address before they become common untruths.

Firstly, it is true that the Amiga Foundation Layer which ships on the SDK does
not have memory protection. However, this does not mean that Ami(TM), the next
generation Amiga Digital Environment will not have memory protection. A comment
made in an article in the last AmigaWorld seems to have been interpreted in such
a way as to suggest that this is the case when in fact the point being made was
that Amiga is looking at many solutions for providing robustness and security.
Ami(TM) will provide a robust, secure environment and we will use the most
elegant and effective means to achieve this.

Secondly, the End User Licence Agreement that made it into the SDK is in error
as a result of a legal misinterpretation. There is NO ROYALTY to be paid for any
application either created with the SDK or which will run on Ami(TM). Amiga will
be creating a scheme in which third parties can pay a royalty to Amiga in
exchange for official Amiga certification, branding and promotion. This provides
a revenue stream to Amiga and a value add for the third party. This scheme is
entirely voluntary.

The third point has been drawn as a conclusion from the first two, namely that
Amiga is abandoning the desktop market. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The announced AmigaOne will feature processor options ranging from 600 Mhz to 1
Ghz, with other, even more powerful devices already on the drawing board. The
conclusion to be drawn from this is either that Amiga is very committed to the
desktop market or that we are going to build one mother of a cellphone.

We are committed to making the Amiga THE best computer system in the world. Yes
we are also going to go into other markets, but that does not mean we are
abandoning the desktop, the Amiga philosophy or the loyal Amigans who have stood
by the platform through the good and the bad.

Thank you,

The Amiga Team

               AN APOLOGY TO THE AMIGA COMMUNITY AND MR. HARDWARE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Thom Wallace" <twallace\@panix.com>

To the Amiga community and Mr. Hardware Computers:

I felt it was necessary to express my thoughts on this unfortunate situation
after receiving a distressing email from Mr. Hardware. This posting is to offer
my sincere apologies pertaining to the latest release of SBase4Pro.

In my haste to put together the distribution files for version 1.36 of
SBase4Pro, I incorporated version 1.34 of the forms designer. That version works
under AmigaOS 3.1 but not AmigaOS 3.5. How this happened is truly unknown to me.
At the time I was sure that the entire distribution was correct. Not only did my
blunder cause problems for Mr. Hardware but more importantly his customers. I am
making no excuses for what happened. I am solely responsible for this mishap and
hope all of you can forgive me.

Mr. Hardware now has the correct version of the forms designer and is making
every effort to get this critical program to his customers. The correct program
is called SBFDpro and it is version 1.36. If anyone is using the wrong version
(1.34.NN), You can contact Mr. Hardware at:

@node not14 "APEX DESIGNS AND BLITTERSOFT ANNOUNCE PARTNERSHIP"
               APEX DESIGNS AND BLITTERSOFT ANNOUNCE PARTNERSHIP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

July 22, 2000 - Apex Designs (http://www.apex-designs.net/) today announced a
distribution agreement with Blittersoft (http://www.blittersoft.com/). This
agreement will allow Blittersoft to sell Payback
(http://www.apex-designs.net/payback.html), Apex Designs' GTA-style game for the
Amiga, through both their website and over the telephone. The game will also be
directly available through Apex Designs' website, which will accept credit and
debit cards.

Payback is a game that allows the player to find out what it would be like to be
a master criminal. It's entirely non-linear - to complete a level the player
simply has to obtain a certain number of points - how they get those points is
entirely up to them; they can do what the local kingpin tells them, uncover
secret missions or just go on a mad killing spree. There are lots of hidden
surprises to discover, so it will be necessary to play the game through several
times to find all the extras.

The game engine supports perspective correct texture mapping, environment
mapping (reflections), realistic shadows, alpha-channelling (lens flares,
explosions and shockwaves), 12 channel 3D sound and realistic physics. The game
will also be translated into several languages and is due for release in
November 2000.

About Apex Designs

Apex Designs have been writing high-quality games for the Amiga since 1994, and
have been releasing games on the Internet since 1996. For additional

        NOVA DESIGN WILL DEMONSTRATE D'AMIGA WORKSTATION AT AMIWEST SHOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nova Design is pleased to announce the release of the d'Amiga Developer
Workstation at AmiWest. "In partnership with Software Hut, we will have the very
first d'Amiga Developer Workstation on display and we will be selling d'Amigas
throughout the show," said Kermit Woodall of Nova Design.

The d'Amiga represents outstanding value to the Amiga developer community in its
functionality and support. Feature for feature, it represents the most
affordable performance and comprehensive support available on a standardized
platform to Amigans and other Amiverse developers.

The developer machine is also more than just a tool. It represents the first
significant opportunity for Amigans and former Amigans everywhere, to join
forces and help bring about a real change in the way computers work. The
developers machine, which comes with the new Amiga SDK included, can also be
configured to run Amiga Legacy software through emulation, adding further to its
potential value for anyone considering a purchase.

Amiga has also bundled $1,000 worth of technical support in with every purchase.
It's almost like being paid to buy the hardware!

Visit Nova Design's booth at AmiWest (http://www.amiga.com/events/) this weekend
- and see the future in the making.

For information on d'Amiga visit Software Hut at www.softhut.com, and for more

@node not19 "AMIRC ON THE WWW LAUNCHED FROM IBROWSE"
                     AMIRC ON THE WWW LAUNCHED FROM IBROWSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Jeff Pierce" <jeffanim5\@loop.com>

To All,
     For those of you who were curious about accessing IRC sites on the web and
wanted to do it with minimal effort, I have created a simple application using
AREXX, IBrowse, Perl, AmigaDOS & AmIRC together so when clicking on a channel
link you simply wait until these partners have finished their tasks, then you
can begin chatting.

I did this mainly because of another one of those "it can't be done unless
you're a PC" sites provided several IRC channels for access. In order for you to
use this setup, you should have:

     TCP/IP client (Miami, TermiteTCP, AmiTCP, etc.)
     AmIRC V3.5 (available at http://www.vapor.com/)
     IBrowse 2.2 (available at http://www.hisoft.com/)
     MUI 3.8 (available at http://www.sasg.com/)
     Perl V.5 (available on Aminet)
     AmigaDOS ( ;) )
     Arexx ( ;D )

To set up access in IBrowse, click on settings, general, ext. viewer. Set up
access to AmIRC as follows:

     MIME Type: application          Subtype: x-chat
     Extension: cha chat # &
     Viewer: "path to Arexx script"
     Arguments: NONE (do not put any arguments in this field, it's not needed.)

Here is the Arexx script that you can place anywhere, just make sure the viewer
in IBrowse points to it:

/* Get header information from IRC server */
options results
signal on syntax

address command "STACK 540000"
address command "wait 1 sec"
address command "failat 21"
address command "cd work:usr/bin/" /* This is the path to Perl */
address command "perl work:usr/lib/perl/irc.pl"  /* This is the path to the Perl script */
address command "STACK 4096"
exit

. . . . and now the Perl script:

$homedirectory = "ram:t/";
opendir(HOMEDIR, $homedirectory) ||
        die ("Unable to open directory");
while ($filename = readdir(HOMEDIR))
 {
        print ("$filename\n");
        if ($filename =~ /IBrowseTempFile/)
        { $tempfilename = $filename;
         last;
        }
}
die ("Unable to open temp file") unless open(INFILE,$homedirectory . $tempfilename);
closedir(HOMEDIR);
while ($inline =  )
{ chop ($inline);
 if ($inline =~ /SERVER\s(.*)/)
        {
        $servername = $1;
        }
 elsif ($inline =~ /CHANNEL\s(.*)/)
                {
                $channelname = $1;
                }
}
$command = "work:internet/amirc/amirc SERVER " . $servername . " autojoin " . $channelname . " CONNECT";
print "$command\n";
$execute = `work:internet/amirc/amirc SERVER "$servername" autojoin "$channelname" CONNECT`;
chop ($execute);
$delete = `workbench:c/delete ram:t/#? force all`;
chop ($delete);
exit(10);

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now launch IBrowse and go to http://www.liszt.com/chat/. Select a channel of
interest and click on the link. The applications do the rest.

Admittedly this is a rather dirty solution but it gets the job done nicely.
Don't forget to set the stack size high (around 540k) for Perl or the system
will crash. Hope this is of aid to the Amiga community.

Kind Regards,

Jeff Pierce

And the world will know. . . . . .

                        BILL MCEWEN SAYS IT (ALMOST) ALL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Teemu I. Yliselä <teemu.ylisela\@sci.fi>

The following news tidbits are coming straight from the mouth of Bill McEwen,
courtesy of UGN's live audio feed from the show:

The AmigaOne is currently targeted at a December (this year, I should add)
release. It's based on Amiga's own customized motherboard design, using
off-the-shelf parts. Amiga are putting up a hardware division, lead by Dean
Brown, to create custom hardware designs for various devices that will be then
offered to 3rd parties to manufacture.

The SDK is selling better than forecasted. Amiga have been in contact with
numerous major consumer electronics and software companies, including (straight
quote) "every major gaming company out there". Many of these already possess the
SDK. Interest from major companies particularly picked up after Bill's two
recent TV appearances.

A version of the SDK for Windows will be made available next month.

Red Hat will start selling the SDK next week. Also Sun have started using Amiga
software to demo Java stuff.

There are going to be public beta releases of the OE prior to release.

There is going to be an Amiga IPO.

Paul Nolan is now doing contract work for Amiga.

More on the license issues: No software developers will be forced to pay
royalties. Voluntarily, they can sign up for a certification program, which will
give their products an official Amiga "badge" and the chance to have their
product marketed by Amiga themselves. This will cost them $1.50 per sold item.

Amiga will start offering low-cost promotional merchandise to user groups.

At the show, Amiga were showing off an ARM-based touchscreen unit, running the
new OE. The design is by none other than Mick Tinker, and it's not being sold
commercially yet.

Backwards compatibility to the Classic Amiga from the new OE will be dealt with
by something that "is not an emulator"

                        ASIMWARE OUT OF AMIGA BUSSINESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: "Greg Scott" <gscott\@asimware.com>

Asimware is NOT out of the Amiga business.

Many people have been emailing me regarding such and to set the record straight
here are some facts:

AsimCDFS has been discontinued. We have told many people this in the last few
months. It is also stated on our Amiga webpage.

MasterISO is not discontinued.

For those using old web-browsers, or browsers that do not support current
web-based technologies (such as JavaScript and dhtml) then go to
http://amiga.asimware.com/ to find a list of Asimwares Amiga products.

And before declaring a company out of the Amiga business, ASK THEM! I have seen
too many people post messages in various news forums about Amiga companies that
just are not true.

Please have a nice day.

From: Back to the Roots Team <info\@back2roots.org>

Back to the Roots (http://www.back2roots.org/), the Amiga Culture Directory
project, was updated again.

The companies Vision Software and Croteam are supporting our little project now,
too. Since today you can download the games "Roadkill" and "Woody's World", as
well as the brilliant soccer game "5A-Side-Soccer", which is the indoor version
of "Football Glory". Also the games "Whale's Voyage 1+2", "Black Viper",
"Fightin' Spirit" and "Spherical Worlds" from "Neo Software" are back online,
because the contract with "Alive Mediasoft" was never valid.

"Impressions", the strategy experts from the States, are supporting BTTR now for
a long time and now we can give you the games "Afrika Korps", "Airbucks" and
"Caesar Deluxe" for free.

Demo scene freaks will find tons of new stuff (demos, pictures, mods) too. Some
of the new additions from the scene are looking so great, that we can't describe
them with words. They're a must see. Especially most of the 64k intros are
really fascinating as well as all the new eye-candy in the pictures section.

For those of you who don't know BTTR yet: BTTR is a legal web project which
tries to cover all topics regarding the Amiga (games, demos, tools, pics, mods
and more including Amiga emulation on different platforms). Commercial software
(games, tools, etc.) is uploaded only with the permission from the software
companies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: TUMULT Administrator

TUMULT News Service

New class registered: NListtree.mcc.

Author: Carsten Scholling (cs\@aphaso.de)

SupportURL: http://www.aphaso.de/
FileURL: http://www.aphaso.de/www/download/MCC_NListtree.lha

Description:

NListtree.mcc provides you with an easy way of displaying list entries in a
sorted form, a so called tree-structure. NListtree is easy to use and easy to
convert from Listtree.mcc (© Klaus Melchior) which was not updated a long time.
So far as implemented by the programmer and needfull in the application
environment, this class allows the fully free recreation of the list using
drag&drop with support of multiselection.

First time in a list tree class it is possible to move complete structures. That
means, that the complete tree of the moved entry, back to the root-list, is
recreated at the destination if the programmer allows this. The same for copying
entries, which is also implemented.

The class is Freeware/Polymorphware.

                               AROS STATUS UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla <digulla\@sowatec.com>

BGUI has been completely ported to AROS, now. This means that the library can be
compiled and that all demos run. Cudos go to Stefan Berger.

Michael Schulz is working on making mice work on AROS Native/i386. This includes
work on a PCI.HIDD, an IRQ.HIDD, the VGA.HIDD and the Serial.HIDD plus an IDE
driver. Trackdisk is there, too, so the next thing is to find a filesystem to
use. We try to get SFS because it seems one of the best filesystems for the
Amiga at this time. The SFS developers seem to be very positive to this, we'll
see what comes from it.

As for the Sowatec AG hiring developers for AROS, all I can say at this time is
that we had several job interviews and things look quite good. The only thing
that might break it at this time (as I see it) is that we get not enough people.
We figured that we need four developers and last I looked, we had three and one
interview still open. Don't hold your breath but press your thumbs :-)

Nils Henrik Lorentzen has begun to write a framebuffer.HIDD which uses Linux'
framebuffer for rendering. Right now, it's mostly for debugging (it's a
synchronous interface instead of X11s' asynchronous one) but maybe, there will
be a AROS Native/linux-i386, ie. a version of AROS that will boot with the help
of a Linux kernel but without the need to install a complete Linux system. We'll
see what can be done here.

And I'm diving into the depths of Ami, the SDK for the next Amiga by Amiga Inc..
As it looks, the SDK is a bit disappointing because it's very rough and has lots
of holes but on the positive side, Amiga's crew is very helpful and the
developer support is just great. *sigh* Had we just had such a support in the
old C= days. Many thanks for their effort go to Ray A. Akey and Gary Peake and
all the members of the Tao and Amiga support staff that I'm bombing with EMails
;-) If they can keep this attitude, then I have no doubt that in five or ten
years, people will name Ami in the same breath as Windows, EPOC and Linux.
Something really to look forward to.

As for stats, I'm proud that we made 40k hits on our web page and this year has
also been very productive from the EMail side: Last year, there were about 300KB
mails/month in the developer list. This year, we have 1MB mails/month ! Thanks
go to all those members of the development team that have not been mentioned
here but who do important stuff, nonetheless (in no order): Henning Kiel and
Lars Bischoff for reporting bugs, Georg Steger for cleaning up after the other
developers have raged through the code and calling me back to earth when
necessary, Jaime Dias for asking "stupid" questions that make us think what
we're doing, Manuel Lemos for trusting us with BGUI, Requin Frederic for helping
Michael Schulz, Tobias Seiler for continuing the NetBSD port, Bernardo Innocenti
for bugging people to allow us to port their software to AROS and last but not
least all those people who I forgot :-) Thanks to you all; it's your work that
makes this possible.

And at the end, a short note to all those people who started own ports of the
AmigaOS: Good luck to you all. I think you will find out soon enough why AROS
took soo long. The AROS team is still willing to share their knowledge and code
with everyone out there. And we can do this because of the MPL, the only true
Open Source license :-)

                             ANNOUNCE: CHARON V1.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Anthony <TheAntony\@bigfoot.com>

Charon v1.4 has been released. It can be downloaded from my homepage or from
Aminet.

Version 1.4 (31.7.2000)

   - Double click on an entry now starts downloading it immediately, regardless
     of "Maximum transfers" option (it acted just the same as "Start" button up
     to now).

   - Charon sometimes wouldn't resolve numeric IP addresses properly.

   - Added a gadget next to "Proxy" gadget which lists all proxies from
     "Proxies" page in settings window making it easy to set current proxy to
     one of those.

   - Added few more error messages that better explain what went wrong while
     connecting to a host.

   - Added workaround for some servers (or scripts) which send relative URLs in
     Location: header for redirection although HTTP standard specifically says
     that they have to be absolute.

   - While working on the above problem, fixed a much worse bug in handling
     Location: headers that could even cause a crash.

   - It is now possible to log into FTP servers which send their initial
     greeting using somewhat unusual (although perfectly legal) multiline
     response.

   - HTML links parser erroneously treated "./" as "../"

   - Fixed display of remaining time (it actually showed total length of the
     transfer). If I find another bug connected to this, I will have to
     seriously consider becoming a circus clown.

   - Most of numeric buttons in settings window have been changed to a special
     kind of numeric string gadgets. They allow input of numbers only in
     certain range and have bubble help to indicate which range is that.

   - New option: "Always find proxy" tells Charon to always try to set the proxy
     based on your current IP address, not only when you create an entry for the
     first time.

   - Del key is now shortcut for "Remove".

   - HTML parser now ignores mailto: links.

   - Active downloads window didn't update data percentage properly when the
     main window was hidden.

   - Now removes "blah" out of http://www.host.com/file.html#blah user entered
     URLs (which it should have been doing since ages ago, argh).

   - If "Directory structure" option is active (ie. it's not set to -1) and
     filename contains just name of directory, Charon will append index.html to
     it.

   - New menu item and ARexx option: "Export list over" which overwrites the
     file to which it writes the list instead of appending to it.

   - Removed some space between settings pages and save/use/cancel gadgets in
     settings window which sometimes caused MUI to render it in a rather
     strange way.

   - Moved "No proxy" gadget to Local1 page, next to "Proxy" gadget.

   - Charon now sets busy pointer whenever a list is loaded or saved.

   - Corrected spelling of ARexx command TRANSFEREDLENGTH to TRANSFERREDLENGTH.
     The old form is still accepted for compatibility rasons.

   - Added SETAUTHORISATION as synonym for SETAUTHORIZATION ARexx command.

   - Bubble help for main display which showed URL, proxy and percentage of an
     entry is now updated more regularly.

                        AMIWEST 2000 REPORT BY ACGREGORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I went to the Amiwest show in Sacramento, CA for Saturday morning, and the
banquet on Saturday night. I would like to share tidbits of info I got. This
report will be far from complete, so any other info garnered by others will
hopefully illuminate my information. Since, I did not attend the whole show, nor
formally interview anyone, I cannot say the info is "official" although info
from the banquet has gotta be pretty much "official".

OK...let's go....

The exhibitors I saw were the following: UGN, Hyperion Games, Amiga-On-Line,
AmigaZone, Merlancia, AE Mail, FWD Computing, "Lostman", Compuquick, Soft-Logik,
Nova Design, Eyetech, Audiolabs, G&G Publishing, NAG, SACC. Boxer (Anti-Gravity)
had a booth, but there was rarely anyone in it.

   - UGN did the great live interview with Bill McEwan.

   - Hyperion was demoing Heretic. It looked very good, with very nice smooth
     panning and scenery shifting in 3D. The sound was good also.

   - AmigaZone: Harv Laser was there, trying to get people to join his excellent
     AmigaZone group. He was selling some nice 33.6K modems.

   - Merlancia: Good selection of hardware and software including SDK, OS 3.5. I
     am looking for a game, which they didn't have (it's about 6 years old), but
     they said they would look for it and give me a call if they find it...

   - AE Mail: John Zacharias and friends demoed the program AE mail live. I
     bought it from them, because it looks like a good program.

   - FWD Computing: Lots of software, especially CD titles.

   - LostMan: Selling lots of Amiga badged clothing. I wasn't too interested,
     but it looks like good quality.

   - Compuquick: Lots of software, hardware including a full spec developer
     station, the SDK, OS 3.5. They seemed to be very busy.

   - Soft-Logik were selling Pagestream 4 for Amiga/Mac/PC, along with upgrades.
     Unfortunately, it was SACC member manning the booth, not Deron K.
     (Soft-Logik) and on Saturday they did not have Pagestream 4 being demoed.
     Nevetheless I will upgrade to Pagestream 4, soon.

   - Nova Design: Kermit Woodall was their demoing the ImageFX 4. He was also
     selling Millenium, Wildfire, and Alladin. I will upgrade to IF4 soon.

   - G&G Publishing was giving out free copies of the latest issue of "The New
     Amigans", and signing up people for new subscriptions. Mr. Griffin is a
     very nice gentlemen, which an Amiga attitude, namely, if he sees a need,
     he tries to meet it. I wish him the best in this endeavour. I am confident
     he will succeed as long as there is news to be reported, and software and
     hardware to be reviewed.

   - Audiolabs was demoing their outstanding audio program.Was using the two
     screen output mode, and was also outputting one screen to a television.
     They were using a "Repulse" card for their audio. The program and sound
     card look like a winner. I will have to upgrade my Audiomaster software
     and and hardware to this eventually.

   - EyeTech: Alan Redhouse was demoing a rather cool device. It was a black
     box, about 18 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 4 inches tall. It contained
     the dev-box computer, along with a A1200 in it, with proper floppy and hard
     drive. The amiga side was running a Scala demo and outputting to a small
     flat screen monitor. The devbox was running the Elate "boing" demo and
     outputing to I believe a laptop type screen. It was very cool to see two
     computers outputting stuff like that. They also were selling software.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Final comment about the exhibitors:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was a casual, friendly atmosphere. No hype, or pressure sales. Everyone
was very helpful with questions. I am still impressed with the folks who attend
these shows, as they all are able to speak to computer issues with clear
evidence that they understand computers... they are not just consumers who will
buy any product as long as it is flashy or "new"... Quite a contrast from some
of the stores that sell PC's/MAC's etc. I also picked up an issue of Amiga
Active Magazine. It is a very worthy replacement for Amiga Format or CU Amiga.

OK, I hope I didn't leave anybody out. I also want to thank all the exhibitors
for showing up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          AmiWest 2000 Banquet report
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I attended the banquest Saturday night at Amiwest 2000. Here is brief report. I
hope I don't leave too much out, Bill McEwen does speak fast.

First off, the room was nice, with a very good buffet type serving method, and
the food was excellent.

The SACC gave the Ken Barton Memorial award for service excellence to the Amiga
community to John Zacharias. Well deserved, congratulations.

Bill McEwans talk was a rambling and fun talk with lots of nice demos and an old
Commodore videotape add featuring BB King, and others who were using the Amiga
in their professional work. It was clear, that at the timeof the tapes creation,
the Amiga was clearly the outstanding computer.

Mr. McEwen had three computers running. One of them was the ARM Prospector, a
solid state "laptop" not available commerically yet. He had two laptop clones,
one running Linux, the others from a large northwest USA company. What he did
was load code from a floppy on to each of them, and had them all running the
same program. He was attempting to demonstrate that the same code could be run
on different OS's and chips as long as it was written to the Amiga Foundation
layer. One could see how there were slight variations in the smoothless of some
on the animations when comparing with the different machines,but it was the same
animation. If that indeed was what was going onr, it was impressive since it was
a demo. However, as the specs of the machines were not known to myself, it was
hard to say how this would pan out. Nevertheless, it appears that something good
may be going on.

Mr. McEwen thanked all Amiga users, and developers, for keeping the platform
alive. He did this by giving all attendees of the banquest a T-Shirt which
wished Amiga a happy 15th birthday. The slogan on the back of the shirt reads,
"It took them 15 years to catch up...Now they never will" It also sported the
new Amiga SDK construction ball. Apparently there was some criticism that the
first SDK logo was kind of "Dark", so they tried to make it a bit more bright.

At the banquet, Mr. McEwan shared other bits of information:

   - New Staff
      - Bolton Peck is with Hardware QA
      - Bob Cozby (COZ) is also in QA
      - Paul Nolan (Photogenics fame) is on the GUI Team

   - There will be an IPO. He did not say when, he did not give an opening
     price.

   - Dean Brown is working on building a hardware laboratory at Amiga.

   - Amiga will design and build "spec" boards, systems, for OEM's, direct
     licensing or for their own use. They will build mother boards that make
     sense for the end developer.

   - They are working on JAVA implementation.

   - There will be a SDK developer kit that works with "that other OS" because
     many developers use that "other OS" to develop.

   - Many large firms, a veritable "Who's who" have bought the SDK.

   - He will appear with John Dvorak of a show called "Silicon Spring" from time
     to time....I wasn't quite sure how long this would go on (AG)

   - He said that it is helpful to compare where we have gotten in 7 months,
     versus 2 years from the last owners, so there is progress being made.

ROYALTY ISSUE!

The royalty program is VOLUNTARY. However, if any developer wants to work with
Amiga, there will be a royalty. This will give the developer "official" approved
status with Amiga.

The fee will be $1.50 per unit SOLD (not manufactured) or 5% of sales.

Mr. McEwan compared this to royalties from another software company where the
charge can be as high as $1 million dollars before any product is even shipped.
He mentioned that Sony charges royalty on what the developer manufactures(even
if the product is not sold).

Included in the royalty agreement, is help in marketing, advertising, and
product placement.

Continuing the information from the Saturday Banquet Ami West 2000....

   - By August, Amiga will assist anyone who wants to market Amiga paraphenalia.
     They will provide items at cost to those who want to market them. They will
     sell Amiga paraphenalia from their site also.

   - Advantages for buyng the official "d'Amiga"
     1. Free ticket to DevCon
     2. Proactive communication for "enhancements", bug fixes, etc.

   - SDK doesn't have sound, or 3D in it, but these areas will be added.

   - Amiga has not decided on the processor yet for the AmigaOne. They need a
     committment of 100,000 processors, so the roll-out date of XMAS cannot be
     fully confirmed.

   - Many of the features of Amiga OS that was liked will be moved on over to
     the SDK. He was not very specific about this.

   - The classic Amiga will be supported by something "better than an emulator".
     (I didn't know what he meant exactly....would it be hardware?, a dual
     computer, an Amiga PCI....??- AG)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  CONCLUSIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From my perspective, (non-technical, non programmer, user) it would appear that
the Amiga is actually moving...slow, but moving.

Although many questions remain, (CPU for AmigaOne, SDK development in 3D, audio,
etc.) progress appears to be made by Amiga, Inc.

However, we have been down this path before, but this does seem to be much
further..(remember, Viscorp, Gateway)...

The thing that amazes me is the resiliency of the Amiga users/developers, who
still love using Amigas and developing for the community. People who are aware
of the power and usefulness of a incredibly well thought out and designed
computer (the Amiga, that is.)

I am hoping that I did an accurate report, and I am hoping that the statements I
heard and the demos I saw accurately reflect the present and future of
computing.

Hello and welcome to the 24rd issue of AmiChannel News.

August is considered by almost everybody as the holiday month. But this is not
the case for our beloved Amigas.

August is without any doubt the worst month in the Amiga world. Last year, Mr.
Collas and Mr. McEwen were sacked from Amiga and everything in development was
cancelled. Two years ago, it was announced the close of CU-Amiga magazine. Three
year ago, othe magazines closed in August.

There is no evidence of an Amiga earthquake this year, but who knows. I supposed
that we should to way and hope nothing will happen.

That's everything I wanted to say. Remember to visit the SAUG website, which is
located in:

And if you want to contribute to this effort, you can send your articles to:

                ANTI GRAVITY POSTS NEW WEBSITE! JOE TORRE HIRED!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Press Release

July 25, 2000
Anti Gravity posts new Website! Joe Torre hired!

On July 25, 2000 Anti Gravity posted it's new website devoted exclusively to the
development of BoXeR systems. The site contains new information about the
history of Anti Gravity, the story of the BoXeR, Anti Gravity's effort to
purchase Amiga from Gateway and hints of Anti Gravity's future plans.

New techinical information outlines design decisions that have been made and
decisions currently under discussion. Joe Torre was hired to join the BoXeR
development team in bringing the new systems to market.

"Now I get to work on the most advanced classic Amiga compatible ever designed
by the outside world...an "Ultra-Classic" that will enable genius to florish
like the original did. Tweeking the design and mixing the best of ATX with the
best of the Classic, will empower BoXeR owners to be, once again, proud they
still use a, now even better, Amiga computer." -Joe Torre

Joe Torre:

The latter-day Dave Haynie, Joe used to build rockets and robots before Amiga
Inc. hired him to build computers. He quickly earned popularity among the Amiga
universe, onstage at the various devcons using terms like "novice button" that
only an Amiga user would know, buying extra Amigas at shows (and presumably
taking them apart immediately upon getting them home), showing off antique 1983
Hi-Toro joysticks, and building weird contraptions for levitating Boing balls.
In mid-1998 he left Amiga Inc, when a shift in the company's direction reduced
the focus on hardware; today, as Clash Bowley says, he is "actively doing
nothing" in the best possible sense of the word. -Moo Bunny

Joe's not "actively doing nothing" anymore!

Joe will be presenting a working BoXeR motherboard at the AmiWest show in
Sacramento, July 29-30, 2000. The motherboard currently runs code but the
display has not been finished making it difficult to show anything. Joe will
present two separate seminars, the first will be for developers and the second
for the public. He will present plenty of useful information.

@node not31 "CYBERGRAPHX SUPPORT FOR MEDIATOR PCI GRAPHIC CARDS"
               CYBERGRAPHX SUPPORT FOR MEDIATOR PCI GRAPHIC CARDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Immediate Release

Krakow, PL - 24 July 2000

Elbox Computer, the developer of Amiga hardware and software, who have designed
and produced the MEDIATOR PCI 1200 busboard, announced a partnership today with
Vision Factory Development, developer of CyberGraphX, the widely popular graphic
system for Amiga computers.

Elbox Computer and Vision Factory Development will co-operate to port and
optimize the CyberGraphX graphic system for operation with PCI graphic cards
installed in the MEDIATOR PCI 1200 busboard.

CyberGraphX V3 will be available with the MEDIATOR PCI busboard.

CyberGraphX V4, the extended commercial version of this system may be obtained
from all the CyberGraphX distributors; it will enable even more comprehensive
use of the PCI graphic chipsets capacity.

Support for new graphic chipsets will be developed for both versions (V3 and V4)
of the CyberGraphX system.

Current information on drivers available for MEDIATOR will be reported at
http://www.vgr.com, the official CyberGraphX website.

CyberGraphX

The CyberGraphX standard is being supported by all major Amiga software vendors
worldwide. CyberGraphX was designed to define an independent graphics standard
for Amiga graphic boards.

Continued work on Workbench emulation was also an important issue. Over 7 years
of experience in developing graphics board software was employed in making
Workbench control screens with all the existing Amiga graphic cards.

CyberGraphX is based on hardware-dependent monitor driver and
hardware-independent libraries. This solution has many advantages, one of these
being bug fixes in the Workbench card control.

Speed optimization is another benefit available for ALL the graphic boards
supported by the CyberGraphX system.

CyberGraphX works with majority of the most popular applications on the Amiga
and resources of Public Domain and Demo software available are broad.

MEDIATOR PCI 1200

The MEDIATOR PCI 1200 is a new-generation busboard for Amiga 1200 computers. The
MEDIATOR busboard is fitted with four PCI 2.1-compiliant slots for connecting
PCI devices, thus enabling expansion of Amiga 1200 with a variety of
PCI-standard hardware products.

MEDIATOR's hardware has been made compatible with ALL the available Amiga 1200
turbo cards. MEDIATOR PCI opens an immense wealth of PCI cards for Amiga 1200
owners: network, sound, modem (ISDN), decoding (MPEG-2, MP3), TV, and, most of
all, graphic cards based around chipsets like S3 ViRGE, Savage4, Voodoo3,
Voodoo5, Riva TNT2, etc.

MEDIATOR PCI enables using the high-end cards based around the latest PowerPC
G3/G4 processors (available in the PCI card form) in Amiga 1200 computers. When
this feature is combined with the PCI graphic cards, totally new superb
possibilities are open for Amiga owners.

                    AMITECH-DAYTON ANNOUNCES AMIGAFEST 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Announcing - AmigaFest, The Show Within A Show 2000

AmiTech Dayton Amiga Users Group would like to announce that due to the
tremendous response we received after last years show, we have been asked to
again host the AmigaFest area of the Dayton Computerfest(r) August 26th-27th
2000 at the Hara Arena Exhibition Center! AmigaFest 2000, the show within a show
at the Dayton Computerfest(r) will feature most of the same exhibitors, vendors,
prize drawings, and good times that are always a part of an Amiga gathering set
in one of the largest computer market shows in the United States.

How large? Take a look at these facts:

   - Over 120,000 square feet of vendor space.

   - Almost 35,000 attendees last fall. Amiga people from several states and
     Canada were among the attendees.

   - 2 days of sales, seminars, prizes, and fun.

The Dayton Computerfest(r) is well known as the largest gathering of general
purpose computing supplies, hardware, and software. And a show this large always
has the big bargains (how about new 13gig hard drives for $75.00? They were
there!) And last years AmigaFest proved to be one of the largest gatherings of
Amiga faithful that Dayton has seen for quite some time. This year we are hoping
to better that effort, and we hope to see you there!

Now, let's talk about details:

Table space is only $60.00 for an 8' table with electrical power.

Our area will be in the North Hall, West End. Space for approximately 25-30
tables will be available.

This show is fully supported by Amiga Inc. who has graciously donated two Amiga
1200 computers among other items. Other donations are pending. All items will be
raffled during the show.

Raffle tickets are $1.00 each, or 6 for $5.00

Seminar space is available. People wishing to conduct a seminar should contact
us in advance.

An after show dinner gathering is in the works. It will be a pay-as-you-go
informal affair Saturday evening. This proved to be a very popular event last
year. Seating space will be limited. Details to follow.

If you are not able to make the trip to Dayton, please consider donating prizes
for the raffle. It's a good way to show your support for the Amiga Community and
a great way to get your name out to the public.

Make your plans today! Dayton, Ohio is the place to be August 26th-27th for
AmigaFest2000, The Show Within A Show!

For further information concerning table space, seminars, or prize donations
please contact:

@node not33 "CS&E SAY GOODBYE TO THE AMIGA"
                         CS&E SAY GOODBYE TO THE AMIGA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear friends,

     It won't come as a shock to most within the community that advance sales of
our forthcoming Amiga titles have been disappointing. On the classic Amiga we
are fighting with hands tied behind our backs due to the lack of new hardware
sales and in addition we are being hit below the belt by piracy. It is with deep
regret that I announce CS&E has cancelled all future games development for this
system. This was a difficult decision for me to make but financially impossible
for me to ignore.

     More positively, remember we arrived on the Amiga scene in anticipation of
a new machine - hence we will develop for the new Amiga and I have great
pleasure in announcing that CS&E will be giving away development kits free to
all Amiga developers who pledge to release their forthcoming titles through our
network. In addition our £1,000 competition will be carried over to the new
Amiga so that £1,000 will definitely be given away in advance to the developer
of what CS&E judges to be the best software offering, now extended to the end of
2,000. By taking these steps CS&E is making development for the Amiga pay and
ensuring the best quality in gameplay and service for our customers. Nothing has
changed since we entered the Amiga market on the back of successful PC releases
last year, our quality, originality and commitment to Amiga speaks for itself.

     Amiga Survivor will play a key role in being one of the most respected
sources of information for the Amiga community through the launch of the new
Amiga. AS has recently been put in the hands of an independent team of budding
journalists from all over Europe and is the premier independent magazine for
Amiga news and reviews. Issue 10 will be the first release in the new format on
August 10th, after which you will get regular bi-monthly release dates.

     Look out for more news at http://www.CSandE.co.uk coming soon!

                             BACK TO THE ROOTS NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,

after a break we're proud to finally present you a new update on Back to the
Roots (http://www.back2roots.org). Sorry for the lack of updates, but we were
very busy with other projects in the past months.

Finally new legal game downloads are available. One of the companies who's
supporting BTTR now is Vivid Image and their classic game "The First Samurai" is
waiting for you. More interesting might be our cooperation with Vulcan Software.
Vulcan Software gives us every month one of their games from the mini series and
you'll be able to download it for free. The first game is of course the debut
game from Vulcan: Valhalla and the Lord of Infinity.

Of course tons of new scene demos, pictures, mods and more games were added with
this update too.

Info:

I know that many Amiga users don't know how to handle ADF Files, in which our
games and demos are available. But it's easy, because at Aminet you can find an
excellent Tool called "TransADF", which can write ADF files back to disk. It's
as easy as handling DMS files!

Of course you can get this file from the Back to the Roots Aminet Gateway too.
With this Aminet Gateway, you can explore the depths of Aminet with a new layout
and will find there also some new features, like a forum function for each file
available at Aminet! Happy Discussion!
