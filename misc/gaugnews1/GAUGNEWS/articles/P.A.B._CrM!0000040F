Hi  there!   Bet  you are all wondering what this is all about?  Well  I  am
Running the Exeter Branch of P.A.B and recently I have Bought and Handed out
to Bullied Children a number of Second hand Amiga 500.

The  Joy  that  these underpriviliged Kids get from The Amiga is Incredible,
However there is a constant Problem getting suffient old Software to Work on
these machines.

Yes!   Ideally I would love to be able to afford to Buy and issue the  Amiga
1200, However the limited funds Available will not allow that.

I  can only Appeal to all User Groups and all sections of the Amiga World to
Please Help!  If you have any older games that will no longer work  on  your
System, and you would like to Help Bullied Children, Please get in touch!
