Hi!   GAUGers  welcome  to this,  The very first ever  issue  of  the  Group
Newsletter@4 The G.A.U.G Gazette!@5

It is hoped that through these pages,  we can bring you all the latest Group
News! But much more that that, Perhaps a profile on members, Wanted/For sale
Adverts, Amiga News and lots more to boot.

Ok!  Just a little about Myself (@1see my Profile@5) I am currently CO_EDITOR of
an  Amiga  Web & Disk magazine called the@2 RIPPER@5.  This Mag is  produced  by
@2DREAMSCAPE PRODUCTIONS@5 (@1Currently 7 in total@5)  and now of course I have been
asked to produce this Magazine (@1Busy life I lead@5).

Of course if the Group and this Magazine is to succeed, It will require all
the members input, So get that stuff in the post or email it to me at#1 :@2

So  what sort of subjects are we looking for? Well anything related  to  the
group/Amiga.  Members Profile (@1Just a few lines tell us about yourself  your
System etc.@5)  How about a few Jokes to lighten the read? Wanting to  Buy  or
sell  Amiga  goods? Send in an Advert (@1I can even place them in  the  Ripper
which  will give them a wider scope of readers@5).  I'm sure that you get  the
general idea!

Well this being the First issue,  I Possibly will have to write most of  the
Articles myself, Hopefully until I start to get#3 YOUR@5 Contributions Flowing.

If you have any comments/Suggestions regarding this Publication, PLEASE feel
free to Contact me. Either at my email Address or#1:@3
