Liquidise  tomatoes or press them through a sieve with a  metal  spoon
until all the juice is removed.

                       Disregard unused pulp and seeds!

Put  the  tomato juice into a large pot,  add vegetable stock,  tomato
puree, tomato ketchup and sugar and bring to the boil.

When  boiling,  add the salt,  pepper and milk,  bring  to  the  boil,
stirring continuously.  Mix the cornflour with a little cold water  to
form  a thick liquid,  remove the soup from the heat,  slowly stir  in
the  cornflour until soup reaches the desired thickness!  Put pot back
on to the heat and bring back to the boil!@3
