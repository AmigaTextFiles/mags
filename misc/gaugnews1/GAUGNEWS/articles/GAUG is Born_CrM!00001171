Back  in  Early  March of this year,  I had just purchased@1 "Wasted  Dreams",
@5which is an excellent game@1 (IMHO)@5.  However,  I was having some trouble with
the  save  game  positions and decided to e-mail afb@1 (The web based  mailing
list of the once great magazine, @3 "Amiga Format"@1)@5for help. During the to-ing
and fro-ing of e-mails that followed,  someone suggested I should contact my
local user group.  I explained that there wasn't one and got chatting to one
of the guys on the list, @2 Duncan Gow@1(now our esteemed spokesman!)@5about  the
possibility of starting one.

Anyway, @2 Duncan@5 was in touch with some other guys from the West of  Scotland
area, and one of them,@3 Francis Loch@5, set up a mailing list just for us.

Pretty soon there were about 16 of us registered as members of the list@1 (now
23)@5 and we decided to meet up in@3 The Printworks pub@5 in the centre of Glasgow
one Friday night.  We knew the place would be pretty busy, so we all carried
an  Amiga  magazine of some description,  in order for us to recognise  each
other@1 (though I'm sure a red carnation would have done just as well.#6 8@3D)
@5
Around  9  or  10 of us turned up and we all ended up seated round  a  large
table.   This  probably looked rather strange for the regular  Friday  night
punters@1:@5   10 blokes from various walks of life & age groups,  sat  round  a
table covered in miggy mags and obviously having a rather pleasant evening.

The time passed quickly and, due to how busy it was, the chat had to be held
at a fairly high decibel level. Before we knew it the evening was drawing to
a close.  Everyone had had a good time and@1 (for some of us)@5 the refreshments
had  been  flowing freely.  The outcome was that we decided  to  meet  on  a
regular  basis,   somewhere more appropriate than a pub.  Thanks  to @4 Flavvy
@3(Antonious?)@5   we  found somewhere suitable.   Although  it's  a  bit  of  a
mouthfull,  the@7 Strathclyde University Chaplaincy Centre Library@5 is an ideal
venue.

We  meet there on the first Friday of every month.  So far we have  had  one
meeting there and the next one is on Friday@1 5th May 2000@5,  so come along  if
you  get  the  chance.  At the last meeting we discussed the possibility  of
visiting the Kickstart & WOA shows, swapped lots of hard/software, and had a
right good natter about all things Amiga.
@6
                      And the moral@1/@6point of this tale@1 ?
@5
Well,  if you have/use/want an Amiga of any description,  you could do a lot
worse  than  come along to one of our meetings.  Whatever it is that  you're
into, whether it's word processing, music, graphics, games or anything else,
there's almost certainly someone else here who is into the same thing.   And
you  know how good it is to hang out with like-minded people,  don't  you @1 ?
@5Well  that's all from me,  but if your interested,  you can get in touch  or
find out more about us by@1:
