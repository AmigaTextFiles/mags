Well  G.A.U.G.ers!  Here we are at the last article in the first edition  of
the  Gazette.   I would of course Like to hear your comments/Views  on  this
Issue (@3All welcome@5)  However please post them Privately rather than  on  the
Mailing list,  That way I can include all the letters (@1Good or Bad@5)  in  the
next issue.

Sadly this first issue contains Articles not Group Related,  This has to  be
expected  as  very  few  Members  were   willing  to  contribute.   This  is
understandable and was expected,  After all this is a recently formed group,
most  of you hardly know each other and Now this guy you never heard off  is
asking you to write Articles/letters for a Newsletter you have never seen.

Hopefully  having  read issue 1,  You will all  realise  that  I  am  not  a
Professional Journalist (@1it shows Doesn't it :)@5  And it is not  professional
Articles that we are looking for. If its professionalism you are looking for
then The AmigActive is what you want, Not this little Group Newsletter.





You will notice that I am making good use of the word@1 "#8GROUP@1" .....@5Yes I am,
and  the Reason for this is simple ....This publication@3 IS@5 about the @3 GROUP
@5and@3 YOU@5 are part of that@3 GROUP@5 so we need your Input to keep it going.

Certainly  I  can sit here in Cumbernauld and fill a Monthly Publication  up
with  Pictures/Articles,   Even ones that you  might  find  Interesting  and
Informative!  ......But I'm not going to! ....If I did that, Then this would
become The@7 CUMBERNAULD CHRONICLE@5 rather than the@4 G.A.U.G Gazette@5.

If  what  you are looking for is something@3 YOU@5 can sit and read each  Month,
But  not have to Contribute to ....Then I would suggest the@2 RIPPER@5 Magazine,
They  have a Team of 7/8 Writers that produce the Articles,  and do a  Great
job of it as well .... However then Its not a@3 GROUP@5 Publication any more!

No! We need@3 YOUR@5 help and assistance to keep this going, With out you, There
is  no  Group.  So Hopefully For the second issue@3 YOU@5 will not only  see  you
articles/letters Published in these Pages,  but also Read a great deal  More
From others.

Well! time to switch off the "@1Puter@5" and take a 24 hour Break before
Starting another round of my busy Schedule.@4

                Hope to hear from you all in the coming weeks!
