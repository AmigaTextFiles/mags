@5           -----------
The  Europian Union commissioners have
announced that the agreement has  been
reached  to   adopt   English  as  the
preferred   language   for    European
communications,  rather  than  German,
which was the other possibility.

As  part  of  the  negotiations,   the
British   government   conceded   that
English  spelling had  some  room  for
improvement and has accepted  a  five-
year  phased  plan for  what  will  be
known as EuroEnglish (Euro for short).

In  the  first   year,   "s"  will  be
insread  of  the soft "c".  Sertainly,
sivil servants will resieve this  news
with joy.  Also,  the hard "c" will be
replaced with "k".  Not only will this
klear  up  konfusion,  but typewriters
kan have one less letter.

There    will   be   growing    publik
enthusiasm in the sekond  year,   when
the  troublesome "ph" will be replaced
by  "f".   This will make  words  like
"fotograf" 20 percent shorter.

In  the third year,  publik akseptanse
of  the  new spelling kan be  expekted
to  reach   the   stage   where   more
komplikated changes are possible.

Governments will enkorage the  removal
of  double letters,  which have always
ben a deterent to akurate speling.
@5
Also al wil agre that the horible  mes
of  silent  "e"  in   the  languag  is
disgrasful, and they would go.
By  the  fourth year,   peopl  wil  be
reseptiv  to  steps such as  replasing
"th" by "z" and "w" by "v".

During ze fifz year,  ze unesesary "o"
kan  be  dropd  from vords  kontaining
"ou",  and similar changes vud of kors
be  aplid  to  ozer   kombinations  of
leters.
@5
After zis fifz yer,  ve vil hav a reli
sensibl riten styl.  Zer vil be no mor
trubls  or difikultis and evrivun  vil
find it ezi tu understand ech ozer.

Ze drem vil finali kum tru.

gud nit, Ema.
