    10.@3 When they ask @1 "How are you today?"@3  Tell them!  "I'm so
    glad you asked because no one these days seems to care, and I
    have all these problems; my arthritis is acting up, my eyelashes
    are sore, my dog just died..."
@1
    9.@3 If they say they're John Doe from XYZ Company, ask them
    spell their name.  Then ask them to spell the company name.
    Then ask them where it is located. Continue asking them
    personal questions or questions about their company for as
    long as necessary.
@1
    8.@3 Cry out in surprise,@1 "Judy!  Is that you?  Oh my God!
    Judy, how have you been?"@3  Hopefully, this will give Judy a
    few brief moments of pause as she tries to figure out where
    the hell she could know you from.
@1
    7.@3 If MCI calls trying to get you to sign up for the Family
    and Friends plan, reply, in as SINISTER a voice as you can,
  @1  "I don't have any friends... would you be my friend?"

    6.@3 If they want to loan you money, tell them you just filed
    for bankruptcy and you could sure use some money.
@1
    5. Tell the telemarketer you are on@1 "home incarceration"@3 and ask
    if they could bring you a case of beer and some chips.
@1
    4.@3 After the telemarketer gives their spiel, ask him/her to
    marry you.  When they get all flustered, tell them that you
    could not just give your credit card number to a complete
    stranger.
@1
    3.@3 Tell the telemarketer you are busy at the moment and ask
    them if they will give you their HOME phone number so you
    can call them back.  When the telemarketer explains that
    they cannot give out their HOME number, you say@1  "I guess
    you don't want anyone bothering you at home, right?"@3  The
    telemarketer will agree and you say,@1 "Now you know how I
    feel!"

    2.@3 Insist that the caller is really your buddy Leon, playing a
    joke.@1 "Come on Leon, cut it out!  Seriously, Leon, how's your
    momma?

    1.@3 Tell them to talk VERY SLOWLY, because you want to write
    EVERY WORD down.
