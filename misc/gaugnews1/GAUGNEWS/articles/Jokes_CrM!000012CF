Two  guys  are in a locker room after their racquetball game  when  one  guy
notices the other has a cork in his ass.
@3
"If  you  don't mind me saying,"@5 said the second,@3  "that cork looks terribly
uncomfortable. Why don't you take it out?"
@4
             "I can't,"@5 lamented the first man.@4 "It's permanent."
@3
                    "I don't understand,"@5 said the other.

The  first guy says, @4 "I was walking along the beach and I tripped  over  an
oil  lamp.  There was a puff of smoke,  and then a huge man in a turban came
oozing out.
@5
          He said,@1 "I am Hasan the Genie. I can grant you one wish."
@5

A man stumbles into a person in a bar and asks if he could
buy him a drink. "Why of course" comes the reply.

The first man then asks: "Where are you from?"
"I'm from Ireland", replies the second man.

The first man responds "You don't say, I'm from Ireland too!
Let's have another drink to Ireland."
"Of course," replies the second man.

Curious, the first man then asks: "Where in Ireland are 
you from?" "Dublin", comes the reply.

"I can't believe it," says the first man. "I'm from 
Dublin too! Let's have another drink to Dublin."
"Of course," replies the second man.

Curiosity again strikes and the first man asks:
"What school did you go to?"
@5
"Saint Mary's," replies the second man.
"I graduated in '62".

"This is unbelievable!", the first man says.
"I went to Saint Mary's and I graduated in '62 too!"

About that time in comes one of the regulars and
sits down at the bar.

"What's been going on?", he asks the bartender.

"Nothing much", replies the bartender.
"The O'Malley twins are drunk again."
