                            History & Development@1
                            ---------------------
@5
The City of Glasgow began life as a makeshift Hamlet of huts huddled round a
6th Century Church, Built by St Mungo on the banks of a little Salmon River-
The  Clyde.   It  was  called@1 "Gleschow"@5 Meaning@1 "Beloved  green Place"@5  in
Celtic.  The Cathedral was founded in 1136:the university, The second oldest
in  Scotland,Was  established  in   the  15th  Century:   and  in  1454  the
flourishing Mediaeval city wedged between the Cathredral and the  river  was
made a Royal Burgh.

The  City's  Commercial  prosperity dates from the  17th  Century  when  the
lucrative Tobacco,Sugar and Cotton trade with theNew World flourished.   The
river Clyde,  Glasgow's gateway to the Americas,  was dredged,  Deepened and
widened in the 18th Century to make it navigable to the City's Heart.



By  the 19th Century,  Glasgow was the greatest shipbuilding centre  in  the
World.  From the 1820s onward, it grew in leaps and bounds westwards along a
steep  ridge  of land running parallel with the river.  the hillside  became
encased in an undulating grid of streets and Squares.
@5
Gradually the individualism,  expressed in one-off set pieces characteristic
of  the  18th  Century and early 19th Century,  gave  way  to  a  remarkable
coherent  series  of  Terraced squares and crescents  of  epic  proportions-
making Glasgow one of the finest Victorian cities.

But  the price paid for such rapid industrialisation,  the tremendous social
problems  manifest in the squalor of some of the worst 19th  Century  slums,
was high!

Today the city is still the commercial and industrial capital of the West of
Scotland.   The most Notorious of the slums have been cleared  but  the  new
buildings lack that sparkling clench-fisted Glaswegian character of the 19th
Century.
@5
Ironically,   This character was partially destroyed  when  the  slums  were
cleared  for  it  wasn't  the  Architecture   that  had  failed,   only  the
Bureaucrats, Who designated such areas as "Working Class Gettos".

Little  remains  of  mediaeval Glasgow which stood  on  the  wedge  of  land
squeezed between the Cathedral and the River Clyde.  Its business centre was
The  Cross,   a  space formed by the Junction of several Streets-  the  tall
square Tolbooth Steeple,  1626 in the Middle.  Opposite is Trongate, an Arch
astride  a footpath,  complete with Towers and a Steeple Salvaged  from  the
17th century St. Mary's Church-Destroyed by Fire in 1793.

The  centre  of 20th Century Glasgow is George Square,  a tree lined  Piazza
planned in 1781 and pinned down by more than a dozen Statues including an 80
foot high Doric column built in 1837 to carry a Statue of Sir Walter Scott.

@5
The  monumental neo-Baroque City Chambers 1883-88 which takes  up  the  East
side and the Merchants House 1874, on the West.

To  the  south of the Square,  in a huddle of narrow streets,   is  the  old
Merchant  City.  Of interest here is the Elegant Trades House,  85 Glassford
Street,  Built by Robert Adam in 1794.  An elegant lonic portico stands on a
rusticated ground storey flanked by Domed towers.

Hutcheson's Hospital,  158 Ingram Street,  is a handsome Italianate building
designed by David Hamilton in 1805. Nearby is Stirling's Library, originally
an 18th century private residence, it became the Royal Exchange in 1827 when
the Corinthanian portico was added.

To  the  North  West is Kelvingrove,  Victorian Glasgow at its best.   Built
around a steep saddle of land,  landscaped by paxton in 1850 and lined along
its edges with handsome terraces.

Last but not Least are the banks of the River Clyde.  From Clyde walkway  on
the North bank you can see@1:
