                          Pointer -  R (Keyboard Only)

      You can click on any of the buttons on the panel using the mouse or
      use the keyboard shortcuts above. Please note that the TIME feature
      can  not  be accessed from the panel.  Only from the keyboard!  The
      same applies to the pointer function. No keyboard option - sorry :(


                              IMPORTANT NOTES:
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      When viewing a `Scrolling Article' (like this one) then please note
      that you can use both mouse buttons on the NEXT and PREV buttons.

      Left Mouse Button will scroll forward/back a page.

      Right Mouse Button will scroll forward/back a line.

      You CANNOT use the GOTO function on these type of articles :(


                           DETAILED INFORMATION:
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      PAGE FUNCTIONS
      ==============
      DMC  consists  of  an  Index of various pages which can be flipped.
      The Index pages are where you select to load an Article or IFF file
      from.   You  can check at anytime to see how many Index pages there
      are  by  looking at the top right hand side of the screen.  It will
      display something similar to this: 

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Index                                                  Page 1 of 11
      -------------------------------------------------------------------

      Which should tell you that there is 11 Index Pages to view! :^)

      If you have loaded an article, like you have now, then obviously it
      will  have  the  article  name  in place of Index above.  (you have
      already loaded an article if you are reading this!!!)

      There  are,  however,  four different types of articles that can be
      viewed with DMC and these are:

      Paged  - Complete with coloured text and clipart images.
      Split  - Two columns to each page with coloured text and clipart.
      Scroll - Like this one. No Clipart or coloured text (mono).
      Secret - Can be any of the above types.

      When you are on the Index Pages, you will see a list of items which
      you  can  click  on  with  the  mouse.   Only  the  items which are
      hi-lighted will load an article.

      When  you  load an article (which you have obviously done), the top
      info bar will change to say either:

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Article Name                                           Page 1 of 11
      -------------------------------------------------------------------

      or

      
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Secret                                                 Page 1 of 11
      -------------------------------------------------------------------

      or

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Article Name                Line No: 0024                      000%
      -------------------------------------------------------------------

      The last one will mean that a `Scroll' type article is being viewed
      and you will be able to see the line number and percentage.

      All  others  will be similar to the Index Pages info bar.  The only
      major  difference  being  that `INDEX' is replaced with the name of
      the article.

      Right!  Just as with the Index Pages, you can flip through pages of
      each  article (or scroll).  First check to see how many pages there
      are (or percentage).

      To  view  the  next page, all you have to do is click on `NEXT' and
      the next page will be shown (if there is a next page).

      You can keep doing this until all pages have been shown obviously.

      If  you  feel  that  you want to retrace back to the previous page,
      simply press the `PREV' Button.

      It's  as  simple  as  that  really.  Now here comes a more in-depth
      description of each button:


      PAGE VIEWING/FLIPPING
      =====================
      To  view  either  an Index Page or Article Page, first check to see
      how many pages there are by looking at the top right of the screen.

      You can either press the NEXT, PREV, FIRST, LAST or GOTO buttons on
      the panel to move your way through an Index or Article or use these
      shortcut keys instead.

      NEXT  - Right Cursor (arrow) Key     PREV - Left Cursor (arrow) Key
      FIRST - Up Cursor (arrow) Key        LAST - Down Cursor (arrow) Key
      GOTO  - Space Bar

      Let's say  you are on the last page of an article and you decide to
      choose NEXT, DMC will not allow you to do this as there are no more
      pages.   The  same applies to the LAST function.  Of course it also
      applies  to  the  PREV  and FIRST functions if you are on the first
      page.

      The GOTO function is a little different.  It allows you to manually
      enter  the  page  you  want to, erm, GoTo!  Simply type in the page
      number  and  you will be shown that page if it exists.  If you type
      in  a  silly  number  DMC  will not try to access that page!  (This
      function is NOT available when viewing `Scroll' type articles!)


      PRINTING ARTICLES
      =================
      You  can either press the PRINT button on the panel or simply press
      Shift and P on your keyboard.  This won't function if an article is
      not being viewed.

      You  will  be  presented with a requestor asking you if you want to
      print with these settings:

      NLQ On/Off
      Normal/Small Size Print
      Current Page/Full Article

      NLQ  stands  for  Near Letter Quality and uses twice as much ink as
      DRAFT (NLQ Off) uses, but you do get a better print out.  The other
      two   options   don't   need  discussing  here  as  they  are  self
      explanatory.

      Please note that for the first two functions to work correctly, you
      MUST be using the correct printer driver.  They won't work with the
      `Generic'  driver.   The  best  way to print via DMC is to load via
      your  WB  or  else  set  up your own printer driver on the DMC Boot
      Disk's  `Devs:'  Dir.   (use  preferences if supplied on this disk)

      Before  I  go  any  further, I must point out that the Index Button
      will  only  work if you are viewing an article or small IFF picture
      (the  pictures  shown  between the top info bar and the panel)

      You  can  either  click  on the Index button on the panel or simply
      press Escape on the keyboard.

      Obviously you know how to load Articles and Pictures from the Index
      Pages by now because you are reading this, but just in case:

      If  an item on the Index Pages is hi-lighted when the mouse pointer
      is  over it, you can either press the mouse button to load the file
      or press the RETURN key on the keyboard instead.


      OK, that's the top row out of the way.

      SPECIAL FUNCTIONS
      =================
      The bottom row of buttons contain some special functions, but there
      are  some  special  functions  that  can  only  be  accessed by the
      keyboard (see end of this article).

      The ABOUT button will tell you about DMC and F1 Software etc.
      Simply  click  on  it  or  press  the A key on the keyboard.

      The  SEARCH  feature  will  only  become  available when viewing an
      article  and  can  be  accessed  by  clicking  on it's button or by
      pressing  the  F  key  on  the  keyboard.   When  the search screen
      appears, you can type in the word you want to find.

      This  can  be  typed  in  either  UPPERCASE,  lowercase or MixTUre!
      Simply follow the on-screen instructions.  If a match is found, DMC
      will  tell  you on which page and even on which line.  (Scroll type
      articles will function a little differently)

      If  you choose to view the page containing the match, DMC will even
      show you exactly where it was found on-screen via a flashing bar.

      You  can  only search forward through an article - not backwards!

      Sorry,  but  DMC  searches  from page 1 of an article each time you
      select SEARCH no matter which page you are currently viewing at the
      time.

      However,  if  no match is found, DMC will simply return you to your
      current  page.  Please also note that the search may take some time
      on large articles on low-end Amiga's - sorry :(

      (Scroll  type  articles  -  The  search feature works, but you will
      automatically be shown where the word is - if a match is found.  If
      you want to continue searching for other occurrences, simply select
      SEARCH  again and enter in the same word.  Scroll type articles are
      searched  from  the  current  position  only.   No  backward search
      available!)

      The  COLOURS function is only available when viewing articles also.
      Shortcut  keyboard  option  is C.  It simply toggles the colours in
      case you find them hard to see on your TV or Monitor :)


      The MUSIC function can be accessed from the panel or by pressing M.
      It  will  bring  up  a display.  From here you can load three music
      modules  or  switch  them off to free memory.  If a music module is
      missing from disk and you select to load it, your selection will be
      ignored.  If you choose to free a module from memory (it also turns
      the  module off) and you want to switch it back on, then it must be
      loaded  from disk, so simply click on the module button you want to
      hear or press F1-F3 instead.  Select OK when done (or press RETURN)


      The SECRET function can be accessed from the panel in the usual way
      or  by  pressing  S  on  the keyboard.  This will attempt to load a
      secret  encrypted  article  if one is supplied.  If so, you will be
      prompted  to  enter  the  correct  password before you can view the
      article.   You will be told how many letters are in the password to
      try  and  help  you.   You  cannot  type in anymore letters than is
      required  either  (DMC  is very intelligent :) If you get it wrong,
      you'll have two more chances!  If you get it right, you get to view
      the  article  -  simple as that really.  (secret articles cannot be
      read  via a text editor.  They can only be read via DMC as they are
      fully encrypted!)

      The  CLI button can be used to flip DMC into background mode to let
      you  work in either CLI or WBench depending on where you loaded DMC
      from.   All processor time will be returned to your system so other
      `real'  multi-tasking  programs run at their normal speed.  You can
      also  use  the  Left Amiga and A to toggle this option.

      When  in  CLI/WB, you MUST press Left Amiga and A to return to DMC.
      (The  Left  Amiga key is next to the Left ALT key - on your `Amiga'
      Keyboard)

      Any  music  that  is playing via DMC will still play when in CLI/WB
      mode.   Please  note  that  due  to  Amos being crap!  DMC will not
      multi-task  with  Amos  programmed titles :(

      The  QUIT  button  will  let  you quit DMC back to either CLI or WB
      depending  on  where  you loaded DMC from.  It can also be accessed
      from  keyboard  by  pressing SHIFT and ESC at anytime.  Please note
      that no requestor/prompt is given, DMC simply quits.


      OTHER KEYBOARD ONLY FUNCTIONS
      =============================
      Pressing  T  will  bring up the date and time and let you check out
      your  memory  etc.   You  will require a battery backed up clock in
      your Amiga before this function will be of any real use.

      Some past users of DMC asked for this, so here it is.  It will also
      display some messages on certain dates, but you'll see 'em when the
      time comes!!!


      Pressing R will change the mouse pointer for you and there are is a
      total  of  5  to choose from.  Simply press R until you see one you
      like.
