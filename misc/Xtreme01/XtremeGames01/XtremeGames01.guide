Charm Design has announced their new game called Forgotten Forever. It's Dune II / Command & Conquer clone with a lot of features. According to the authors, game requires AGA or CyberGraphiX, 68EC020/14, 4 MB memory and 5-10 MB HD space. Demo version wasn't available at the moment this was written, but hopefully it'll be reviewed in the next issue.

Do you think that Amiga need games like Red Alert, Monkey Island 3, Death Rally and so on? If you said yes, here is great news for you. ClickBOOM is planning to convert some of the greatest PC games for Amiga and they want your vote. You can vote your favourite games at ClickBOOM's homepage, address is http://www.clickboom.com/conversions.html.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}SUOMI-PELI'S NEW RELEASE@{fg text}@{bg background}

We have had here in Finland few good games, like Stardust and Super Stardust. But then Amiga had financial difficulties and nearly all game companies moved to PC, but luckily there was still guys who believed Amiga still exist. Suomi-Peli has released their new game called Damage and it's for all who like destruction style games. The idea is simple; kill as much as possible. Try the demoversion which can be found from Damage's homepage at http://www.sci.fi/~damage. There you can find more information and ordering details.

I will get full version for FREE straight from the Damage's authors in the Abduction '97 demoparty which are been held in Oulu, Finland 6-8th of June, 1997, so I guess I review it in the next issue.

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}CLICKBOOM SUPPORTS POWER UP@{fg text}@{bg background}

5 May, 1997: PXL Computers and ClickBOOM announce a cooperation with Phase 5 Digital Products on making games for the Power Amiga.

"We strongly believe that the future for the Amiga lies in the PowerPC processor. Furthermore, we believe Phase 5 is and will continue to be the Amiga hardware leader. Therefore, we have selected Power Amiga as our future platform of choice", says Alexander Petrovic, the PXL and ClickBOOM producer.

The first game produced for the boards will be Myst. For Phase 5 this is good news, because they will have at least one software product for their boards...

Following Myst, other forth coming ClickBOOM "killer games" will be fully optimized for the PowerPC chip, as well.

"We are happy to see how engaged ClickBOOM has realized all their ambitious projects in the past, and we are excited that their new projects will be targeted for the PowerUp accelerators", says Wolf Dietrich from Phase 5.

The exact timeline of ClickBOOM Power Amiga releases is still to be decided. Currently, ClickBOOM's strategy can be outlined in two steps:

1. Starting with Myst, a couple of forth coming projects will support both the 680X0 and the PowerPC chip.

2. ClickBOOM will use this transitional period to work on a first Power Amiga only "killer" game. After it's release, all the following games will be Power Amiga-only.

<==========================================================================>
                       XtremeGames Writing Guidelines
<==========================================================================>

The four most important requirements for submissions to XtremeGames are:

     1.  Please use English. Finnish is also acceptable, but we prefer
         English, because I hate translating. :)

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid screens
         of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break, guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes formatting
         the magazine much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to
the editor.

   When I saw this game I thought: "Oh not again, Nemesis/Project X clone." I have seen and played so many different this kind of games that it's quite hard to imagine something that is not done yet. But as usually, I was wrong, when the game was loaded, first good thing was the nice techno style music. "Yes! Good start!", I though. :)

   Your mission is typical: Aliens are invading planet Earth and you have to fly in the space and destroy all aliens. Nothing special yet, but let's look a little bit closer what is the name of the game. Enemies, rocks and so on, can attack from every directions and background graphics are nice to watch, but nothing special in them.

   The full game will be more than 33 MB in size and contains seven levels: two conventional 2D-scenario and five 3D-fullspeed shooters. Everything in the game is rendered. Before every level is an introduction animation that tells you the story and describe the following confrontation. The demo version which is quite easy to complete can be found in Aminet and it's about 1.9 MB in size.

   If you like this kind of games, this is good thing to buy and sure you buy it, don't copy, right!?!

   When I saw this game's readme -file in Aminet I was excited because it said: "A Nintendo's MegaMan -like game." Of course I quickly downloaded it to get good memories back. But, when I saw the intro-picture I was terrified of what I saw.

   This guy had definetely not used more than 5 minutes to draw it. And then there was this horrible music. Yikes!, I said. This is the worst crap I've ever heard in a game. Still (with pain) I decided to wait and see what will be next.

   The next screen said: "How do you like the music?" A very stupid question. "I hate it", is the answer. But also in that screen was a text: " At any time you can terminate the program by pressing ctrl-c." This is the only thing that should be taken seriously in this game.

   At the point where the intro started to reveal the stages I pressed fire button and I came in a point where I could choose a character. I chose the first one. It looked a bit like Jason (everyone MUST know a worst horror film in the world called: "Jason").

   Then I was able to choose the stage. I chose the first one. The stage begun. When I for the first time pressed the control pad to right I thought that my character was stucked to one point because of a bug, but soon I realized I was wrong. It just moved so slowly. I mean, its legs went faster than a sewer machine and it's body went slower than a snail.

   Then I pressed the pad up. It jumped so fast that I could hardly see it on it's way. When for the first time I died I really got surprised: death-sound was great! This inspirated me to kill more those stupid-looking "monsters".

   Most of the enemies didn't have animation at all. They died with an explosion which was quite good-sounding too :) But this is the only good thing in this game. Only change between this game's stages is that in some stages you go upwards and in some stages you go forward. They all look stupid. After second trying the game was finished. (I wonder why I did it.) This is really something for masokists.

   If you still want this game, you can find it from Aminet:

@node "Haktar" " Reviewing Haktar "

<============================================================================>
     @{b}Haktar@{ub}                                                By: @{"Ahti Komu" link "Editor2"}
<============================================================================>

   Exceptionally this not a review of a game. This is a review of a adventure-game making program. Or actually Haktar is not a program to make a game but an engine. It uses the file(s) you have created in your game-dir (that's the dir where the game is located).

   This dir is called "head-path". Anyway, although I have never before used a program like this I could say that this is something great! I mean, you can do so much with it. You can show ILBM pictures and view text files, run programs etc. This, if something, is professionally made.

   The language of the program is quite much similar to C. I'm not going to explain all commands to you. Strangely but still rationally the choice procedure has to write (How should I say this in English ;) from tail to head.

   For example you set a flag indicating that a chest is opened. Then you need to test if it is opened and if it is you make it possible to be closed. The procedure would be like this:

		ifflag chest open
		 [
		  do close chest
		   [
		    delflag chest open
		   ]
		 | (<- that's OR which makes something else if flag is
		    not set)
		  do open chest
		   [
		    setflag chest open
		   ]
		 ]

   So, that makes a chest. When for the first time you look at the chest, it is closed (chest open-flag is not set), but still it has to check first if the flag is set. I mean, this is totally rational, what could you test is there's no flag indicating that the chest is open.

   Now you might think that why not set a chest closed-flag. At the first time I went on that too, but if you at the beginning set a flag that indicates that the chest is closed, it gets closed every single time when this file is read and the program reads it again every time when something is made to chest. So, you open the chest, program re-reads the file and closes it again ;) Well, enough of that.

   When you are learnt to use this program you can make a LOT with it. You can show a picture at any time and even the gfx of the main screen is totally what you want (If you can draw what you want, I mean).

   In the package there is also 3 games made by coder. The first, "Alterhouse" is in German and I couldn't understand a thing of it but I saw that it was something great looking stuff. Graphics were great.

   The second, "Example" just shows how to make a simple game with it. And the third one "My Room" is a game that has no target to reach, but still is a great experience. It's a quite exact game of coder, Guido's room. There is an Amiga (You can even play with it!!), C64, chairs, etc. This really shows what you can do with this. This inspired me to make a little try out of my room. It worked fine. (Although I didn't make my Amiga in it) I was very pleased when I got it to work.

   Making a game with Haktar AND without an text editor at the same disk is really painful (Believe me). This program should be used with harddisk and couple of megabytes of memory (I prefer FAST).

   I'm now planning to make a RPG with this when I have time. The docs says that these games could be sent to him. And if you let him, he will spread them as PD. Though you can spread them yourself too but it's more cool to have it in a PD-disk of some other guy, don't you think? I'm going to do it.

<============================================================================>

   SortTiles V1.00 is a very simple WB game where you have to find a free place for the tile shown in the lower left corner. Then you have to place it in one of the five boxes above. Every placed tile gives you one point. There is a time limit; if clock reaches 12, a new tile will be shown. If you miss it, one bonus point (blue box at right) is lost. If there are no bonus points left, game over.

   You can increase count of bonus by collecting tiles of the same colour in one frame. There is only one bug in the game; when you resize the window, SortTiles sometimes messes up redraw. Hopefully this can be fixed by resizing window again. You get bored after a couple games to this game, because there aren't any surprises. SortTiles requires KS 2.0+, math libraries and 8-colour WB screen. Check it out and make your own judgement.

   I guess everyone has played some kind of version of this game. My favourite was C64's BattleShips. I spend many hours playing it. BattleShips II is a modern version of this great game with animations. They make you feel like being in the middle of war field. The game idea should be clear for everyone and all I can say that this game is great fun for a long time. So, enjoy it!

<============================================================================>
  @{b}Interview: Jouko Pynnönen, author of SuperWorm V2.11@{ub}   By: @{"Kari Suvivaara" link "Editor1"}
<============================================================================>

   1. Age, length and weight?
Age is 21 years, length probably between 170 - 180 cm, weight probably at this moment between 60 - 70 kilos.

   2. Where did you get the idea to write SuperWorm?
All started from an impulse: one night I decided to do C-languaged program. After thinking for a while I decided to make a wormgame and something made me to do the steering free, not 90 degrees like in "normal" wormgames.

   3. What programming language did you use in SuperWorm?
At the first night made C-languaged version I translated to pure assembly after noticing the game getting slow dramaticly with pure-A500.

   4. What Amiga do you have?
Amiga 1200/030/FPU 68881, 2 MB CHIP + 4 MB FAST

   5. Why do you support Amiga, why not PC?
For some reason I haven't get used to PC (Windows) environment. It's also a habit question (continuing crashing, lagging, clumsyness, etc. isn't very easy to get used to after using the Amiga ;). Things when I need to use a computer (composing music, programming ja many others), computer's purpose is to be a helpful thing, not vice versa. This is the reason why I like Amiga better than PC.

   6. Other game/programs?
More or less not-completed projects can be found whole group, SuperWorm is still the only product which have been released.

   7. Plans for future?
There aren't any - production will maybe continue on not-planning-at-all; There aren't any signs for stopping in sight. There are some ideas (for example SuperWorm III) and I try to make them on my resources.

   8. Greetings?
Home of course and all friends. ;) And something to readers: We live hard times, but there is light in the end of the tunnel. Is that then PC-machine which you will buy in the future? You can think that for example during playing SuperWorm and hoping for best.

<============================================================================>
    @{b}Interview: Riku Rakkola, author of Ampu V1.01@{ub}      By: @{"Kari Suvivaara" link "Editor1"}
<============================================================================>

   1. Age, lenght and weight?
Age: 17 years  Length: 185 cm  Weight: 70 kg

   2. Where did you get your idea to Ampu?
I planned originally to make normal artillery game, but project was delayed and I played Worms at my friends and I got lots of good ideas...and Worms-clone was born...but at least I learned to code on that very project.

   3. Why did you choose BlitzBasic and Assember to your programming languages?
I started Amiga programming on Amos, but because that language started to feel slow and limited I decided to get myself BlitzBasic, because I saw RoketzPD which is made by it, so I thought that can be good language. Assembler came little later when I needed more speed to certain parts and BB was good, because you can add straightly Assembler commands to BB.

   4. What is your Amiga?
A1200 + Blizzard 030/50 MHz + 16 MB, 520 MB HD and 28800bps modem

   5. Why are you supporting Amiga, why don't you support PC?
Amiga is very system friendly computer for it's operation system. Programming on Amiga is also easy, because there are much programming languages. The reason why I didn't bought PC is that all my friends got PC and I'm already had enough for that machine ;)

   6. Have you made other games/programs?
Ampu is my first BlitzBasic game, Amos "junk" I haven't never spread and I haven't done any programs.

   7. Plans for future?
There will be follow-up for Ampu, on the other hand follow-up is bad word for that, because game will be different from Worms and Ampu quite a lot. I can reveal that game will be placed on the Middle Ages, blood flies on it and there are computer monsters in it and there are extra effects for example water where can you swim etc. ;)

   8. Greetings?
All the dudes in #AmigaFIN, Haukka and all the members on Sulpu.

<============================================================================>
           @{b}Editor Kari "RedDragon" Suvivaara introducing himself@{ub}
<============================================================================>

   Hi. I'm Kari Suvivaara, the editor. I live in the land of polar bears, Finland. Actually there are NO polar bears in Finland, believe me. :)  I saw daylight at the first time in Oulu, Finland 10.3.1980. I have two sisters: a big sister Merja, 21 and a little sister Minna, 12.

   I'm 173 cm short and weight is 65 kg. I have light brown hair and blue eyes. I am positive, loyal, enthusiastic and lazy. Hmmmm.... :)

   My hobbies include: IRC, computergames (surprise, surprise), watching television, listening to music and at summer badminton. IRC is very nice way to meet people. I use it to chat with my assistant editors because I don't want to use telephone. :)  IRC is actually part of my "job" I guess.

   Computergames have always been near to my heart. I play them nearly every day. I like almost all kind of games. Only simulators and text adventures aren't for me. My music taste is from the other edge to another, excluding classical music.

   I watch television nowadays quite little, only some series and movies. Badminton is the only sports I like and it's very cheap too. I am also ex-roleplayer, but my friends stopped playing regularly after elementary school and so did I.

   My ex-hobby still lives in my heart; I loved red dragons when I played rolegames. They are so powerful and evil creatures :)  That's why my IRC-nickname is RedDragon. Me, a powerful and evil, are you kidding again, Kari? :)  (Oh yes I am.)

   I'm studying now in Kastelli high school in Oulu. School year ends in a couple a days and next year I'm on 2nd grade. Isn't that just great? My favourite subject at school is geography. Subjects what I can't stand are history, religion and music. They are so boriiiiiiing.....ZZZzzzz.... :)

   My first computer was Commodore 64 and I played with it quite a long time until my friend bought Amiga 500. It was so fast and nice and I had to buy Amiga 500, too. Soon I bought 512k extra memory because most of the games required it. Later on I bought external floppy drive which broke up nearly year ago. :(

   I was getting bored to disks in 1993 and I wanted a harddrive. Unfortunately I didn't know much about harddrives that time so I bought A2000, 1+2 MB RAM, 20 MB harddisk(!) and monitor in June 1993. That 20 MB harddisk felt like superturbofloppy, but nowadays that HD is *very* slow and small.

   I bought Mannesmann Tally MT81-printer little later which is still regularly used in my A1200. I sold A500 away in 1993 to get money to that very printer. In the end of 1994 my friend bought A4000 with 68040-prosessor. Damn, it was fast! AGA graphics and MultiSync-monitor, wow! I was jealous...

   Well, A1200 was also new machine that time and I decided to buy one, but then it happened...Commodore was bankrupt and I was desperate. I even thought to sell A2000 away and buy a PC! I was wise when I didn't to it because Escom saved (?) Amiga from the sure death.

   I bought Escom's A1200 in January 1996. At last! AGA-chipset, better prosessor, faster memory, newer KS, etc. than in old A2000! Later on I noticed that 2 MB CHIP is far from enough and prosessor isn't very fast. I began to dream about accelelator and then the miracle happened: I got an award from Finnish Red Cross for my good school success!

   I bought Blizzard 1230-IV/030/50 MHz with 16 MB FAST from a good friend of mine (thank you Mikael!) who was preparing for final tests in school. This is my present situation with computers.

   I have also dreamed (also when Commodore were alive) of a very fast PC with all the spices but then I thinked again and buried the dreams because I don't like WindBlows 3.11/95 or any other GUIs on PC. PC is very suitable for Internet access but that is the only USEFUL thing you can do with them. (Hmmm...is surfing in the Internet REALLY useful?)

   I don't like GUIs which take up to 16 MB RAM (Windows...) and then programs are loaded to SLOOOOOOOOOW HDs. That's why Amiga feels so fast compared to PC because Amiga don't actually need virtual memory and at the same time those nasty *BIG* swapfiles which slow up booting dramaticly. PCs also get worthless after couple of years because new super programs require new superextrafast Pentium SUPERPRO 999 MHz, 256 MB RAM and WindBlows 2002 ;)

   Ok, that enough. If you want to write to me, here's my e-mail address: karisu@kastelli.edu.ouka.fi. See you in the future!

   At the time only friend I had was my keyboard. That's why I nowadays am a very good pianist. But, when I was 6 we moved to Reisjärvi. Now, that's a small town. I lived there and again was teased by other kids.

   From there we moved to here Haapajärvi where I live now. Here I also was teased by other kids until highschool. But I tried to live with that teasing and joined a band where everyone teased me and eventually I parted from it.

   After this I was in another band but our mixer broke up and eventually so did our band. Now in highschool people are smart enough to not to tease me =). I've gotten a few friends and everything is starting to seem to fine.

   For now I have composed about 200 songs for piano and about 250 songs for Amiga. I bought my Amiga at the summer '95 and since then I've composed almost every day. I have noticed I have an excellent numbermemory.

   Because of that I can calculate VERY fast. I also have a great tunememory which allows me to play almost every song after one or two hearing. I like almost every style of music. Metal, ballads, jazz, classics, rock etc. Almost everything goes...few exceptions are for example tango, waltz and march.

   My hobbies are: playing piano, computers (composing, programming, playing, IRC) and watching TV (luckily we have a cable-TV which allows to have 12 channels).

   At the time I am doing a game. It will maybe be ready after an year. But, I'm not doing it alone. I'm coding it and making it's musics and a danish guy is making it's graphics (thanks Folcka).

   If someone wants to contact me I usually am in IRC at weekdays in channel #AmigaFIN and my e-mail addresses are: ahti.komu@cop.fi and csxm@freenet.hut.fi at summer.

   Also if you want to actually SEE me, come to Motorola Inside '97 held in Lahti. (For more information look in site: http://www.sci.fi/~rajis/motorola.html)

<============================================================================>

   My name is Kalle Kaitala, I'm known as Cobrian in the 'Net, or at least I should be. My computerhobby began when I was about 4-5 years old. My first "computer" was a Commodore Vic-20. It was followed by a C64, a damn good machine back then. Then I got into the consolespin for a while, and I bought a Nintendo and after that a Sega MegaDrive.

   My first contact to an Amiga was at my friends home, he had a Amiga 500. I thought it was awesome. And it was. I soon got a Amiga 600, but I didn't like it that much. Then I got my machine that I have been using for a at least few years now, the Amiga CD³².

   Soon I began to think about expanding the machine. I ordered an SX-1 expansion module from England. Then I got a PC AT-101 keyboard, which is compatible with the SX-1 keyboard socket. I also got a floppy drive and a little later a hard drive. Then I noticed that I was always running out of memory. I got an 8 MB SIMM. That was about 9 months ago. Then then the machine started to crash with no *obvious* reason. I found out that it was a problem with the voltage feed in the SX-1. An Amiga-shop began to try to fix it (Thanks to Garry Cardinal), but my machine isn't fixed yet...It's still has the same problem (because it's not fixed ;).

   I'm at ninth class in school (after summer holiday of course), a normal student like anyone else. I like technomusic, good games and animations, snowboarding and watching Chinese (Manga) cartoons...

   I'm planning to begin a HardWare column on this magazine. If you want to mail me here's my address: Cobrian@freenet.hut.fi.

I wish you a happy life...

<============================================================================>

   Hi all, my name is Markku Heikkinen and I am from Finland. Let me tell to you something about me. I am 22 years old and I have been born in Kuusamo and I am studying now at the Kajaani institute of technology. I will be graduated in 1998 and I will be electrical and electronic technician engineer.

   I have few hobbies such as gym and hunting. My first computer was C64 and I still have it...hmmm really lovely machine. Then I had A500 and now I have Amiga 1200 + Blizzard 1220/4 MB + 80HD + q-drive + megalosound stereo sampler.

   Many people have asked why I'm still using the Amiga. Let me tell you few reasons: First, Amiga is flexible and most easiest to use and WorkBench is just great! Second, if you buy now an expencive PC you will notice later the value of your PC is going down very fast. I bought my Amiga in 1994 and it's still very valueable.

   I compose music with ProTracker and I have been learning machine language, but I can't say I can program anything...maybe some day. I believe the story of the Amiga is not ending and Amiga will survive. Good news are PPC card and A\Box etc.

   Last few years have been very bad times for Amiga users, many have left but there are still thousands and thousands users who still believe Amiga will make new coming and I believe it too! Even here in cold Finland we have lot of great guys who are keeping the Amiga alive and kicking.

   Well, that's all folks, if you want write to me, here is my e-mail address: marhete5@kajak.fi.
