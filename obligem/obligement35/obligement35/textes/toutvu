=====================

   Voici, en anglais, les caract_ristiques de l'OS 4.0 que nous promet Hyperion et
Amiga Inc. Cela a l'air int_ressant mais le mieux serait quand m_me d'avoir
autre chose qu'une liste a nous proposer...

   Current work centers around Intuition and Reaction, 2D/3D drivers, A1 Bios,
additional kernel functionality (virtual addressing and page-based memory 
handling) and the integration of the 68K emulation into the system.

~Here are the modules that make up AmigaOS 4:

- Exec Second Generation (Exec SG)
- Exec is the AmigaOS kernel and was written in 68K assembly for AmigaOS 3.1. It 
has been rewritten in C, as ExecSG, for AmigaOS 4.
- The following features are planned for ExecSG:
  Hardware abstraction layer (HAL)
  Virtual addressing (for automatic stack enlargement etc.)
  Page-based memory handling (less fragmentation and more efficient)
  Virtual memory 
  New library interface
  Resource tracking and management 
  Optional memory protection 
  WarpOS backwards compatibility
- Just in Time (JIT) 68K emulation
- PPC native TCP/IP stack & PPP drivers (fastest on the platform)
- Re-implementation of the Amiga file system (FFS2) for PPC
