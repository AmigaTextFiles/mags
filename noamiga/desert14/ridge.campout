FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

August 6, 1994

WORLD INVITED TO FREEDOM RIDGE FOR CAMP-OUT ON PUBLIC LAND AND 
POSSIBLE FREE-SPEECH PROTEST.  COME SEE THE "NONEXISTENT" GROOM 
LAKE BASE BEFORE THE NEAR-IN VIEWPOINTS ARE CLOSED.

All members of the public are hereby invited to a free CAMP-OUT 
AND GET-TOGETHER AT FREEDOM RIDGE, on public land overlooking the 
unacknowledged Groom Lake Air Force base in Nevada.  The event, 
entitled the FREEDOM RIDGE/TIKABOO PEAK FREE-SPEECH ENCAMPMENT, 
will take place AUGUST 27-28, 1994 (Sat-Sun), at this hilltop 
location about 2-1/2 hours north of Las Vegas.

If there is sufficient interest, a similar but smaller camp-out 
may also be held on the following weekend, Sept. 3-4 (Labor Day 
weekend).

Freedom Ridge is the same location seen in a semi-fictionalized 
segment on Fox ENCOUNTERS, broadcast July 22.  Contrary to the 
impression conveyed by the program, Freedom Ridge is relatively 
easy to visit, either on foot or by four wheel drive.  People with 
4WD vehicles can make it all the way to the top on a rugged track, 
without hiking.  People with standard cars can park at the base 
and hike to the top on a well-marked trail that takes about 45 
minutes each way.  Due to the high altitude (5500 feet) this trail 
may be strenuous for those who are out of shape, but most people 
shouldn't have much difficulty.

The event will be only loosely organized.  The general plan is to 
spend Saturday night on Freedom Ridge in plain sight of the secret 
base, with visitors sharing personal experiences and tall tales 
around a campfire.  On Sunday afternoon, we will conduct "Grand 
Opening" ceremonies for a newly surveyed trail to a higher and 
farther viewpoint, Tikaboo Peak, 12 miles to the east.  Those with 
the time and energy for a challenging 1-1/2 hour backpacking hike 
can spend Sunday night on Tikaboo Peak.

This FREEDOM RIDGE/TIKABOO PEAK FREE-SPEECH ENCAMPMENT is not to 
be confused with the FREEDOM RIDGE/WHITE SIDES END-OF-THE-WORLD 
PARTY which will be held only when and if these near-in viewpoints 
are closed by the Air Force.  This could take place in October or 
later.  The current Encampment is a response to requests for a 
summertime event.  While October weather is cold at night, August 
is generally pleasant, with daytime highs in the 90s and nighttime 
lows in the 50s.

DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE ENCAMPMENT, including directions, 
disclaimers, warnings and advice, will be published in a separate 
document in a few days.  DO NOT COME TO FREEDOM RIDGE UNTIL YOU 
HAVE READ THAT DOCUMENT.  The encampment will be held on legal 
ground and in full compliance with BLM regulations.  The only 
significant danger is getting lost and wandering across the nearby 
military border, which could result in your arrest and a $600 
fine.

The event may include a public protest of the recent seizure--
without a warrant--of the video tapes of an L.A. TV news crew 
that filmed an interview on Freedom Ridge but did not photograph 
the base.  The protest may consist of dozens of people pointing 
"cameras" at the base and inviting the Air Force and Sheriff to 
intervene.  The "cameras" would not have to be real or loaded with 
film, and participation in that portion of the outing would be 
entirely voluntary.

The rendezvous time is expected to be noon on Saturday at the 
Freedom Ridge trailhead, but people can arrive earlier or later.  
The document of detailed instructions will be available by Aug. 11 
and will be sent to all email subscribers of the Groom Lake Desert 
Rat.  Others may obtain email copies by contacting 
psychospy@aol.com.  Copies will also be sent out upon request by 
regular mail and fax.  Contact Glenn Campbell at 702-729-2648.  
(Email is preferred.)

You may feel free to re-post this notice wherever you choose, but 
please do not alter it.
