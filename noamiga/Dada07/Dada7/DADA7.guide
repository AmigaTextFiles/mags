 @{b}"WHAT IS GENIUS"@{ub}

 @{i}by  Vanna Bonta@{ui}


 Epitomized in one  of  Italy's  and  the  world's  greatest  leaders,
 Lorenzo dei Medici, is a very important ability, the understanding of
 which elevates all humanity. The ability is measurable and  evidenced
 by   the   cornerstones  of  science  and  quantum  leaps  of  divine
 achievements in Beauty during his reign which speak  with  undwindled
 power after centuries. Lorenzo's most laudable attribute as a leader,
 and an indication of the man's own  greatness,  was  his  ability  to
 recognize and support genius.
        
 The  period which came to be known as "The Renaissance" was no stroke
 of  luck;  it  was  under  someone's  hand  that  so  many   geniuses
 proliferated  and  the  most  culturally  significant  time in recent
 history flourished. Yet, refusing to use  his  birth-title  of  Duke,
 this  leader  lived  simply  and  it  was  the  people who dubbed him
 "Lorenzo The Magnificent".
        
 Unprecedented advancement in society and civilization  is  no  random
 occurrence.  Leadership  of  a man who recognizes genius and does not
 fear greatness is a catalyst for such impact on the  world,  even  if
 the leadership is brief. Likewise, it behooves us all to recognize as
 leaders those individuals interested in elevating  civilization,  the
 ones  who  understand  that  Art, science, knowledge, and freedom are
 more vital to our survival than most else, for therein lies the fount
 of  solutions,  both  fruit  of  and food for the soul. Society would
 experience another "re-Birth" if genius were protected and  supported
 as a valid "minority".
        
 Genius  is  a  quality  which  too  often  seems to escape the eye of
 contemporaries, much to the detriment of  all  of  us.  Part  of  the
 problem  may  be an actual lack of technique. It would behoove us all
 to polish up our skills on how to detect the real  thing,  especially
 in today's marketing noise. Genius, like love, has many impostors.
        
 The ability to recognize genius will have beneficial ramifications in
 production from the most mundane activity to the most divine of  art.
 While  people  puzzle  over  what in the world makes a meal of beans,
 oven-baked bread,  and  extra-virgin  olive  oil  a  memorable  royal
 banquet, and automatically equate the title PHD with brilliance, true
 genius  remains  too  often  invisible,  perhaps   because   of   its
 simplicity.
        
 Fortunate  were  those  who  did  not need the inflated price or chic
 posturing to  know  exquisiteness!  Italians,  in  the  tradition  of
 recognizing  genius,  knew  olive  oil  and fresh bread to be a royal
 feast before marketing made them "gourmet" and "elegant" (to  inflate
 prices).  There  was also a day when "espresso" and "cappuccino" were
 simply coffee, appreciated as such and priced accordingly.  This  was
 before   the  days  of  "Cafe  coffee",  "shrimp  scampi",  and  that
 redundancy known as "gelato ice-cream"ù twice said, twice the price.
        
 If there is anything to be said for this, it could be the benefit  of
 "increased  appreciation";  but  since  the  quality  of these things
 wasn't recognized in and of itself, until labels and prices,  it  has
 to  be  wondered:  what  is  it  being  appreciated and detected? And
 conversely, some delights are unduly scoffed at and  thereby  missed,
 only because of their "gourmet" classification is personally taken as
 snubbery.
        
 Perhaps in matters of the most mundane joys to divine  Art,  Italians
 recognized  the  real  thing  before  marketing  dictate because they
 trusted what moved them and had the integrity to admit  it,  with  or
 sans approval.
        
 One  can  apply  the  same  axiom  of  recognition  to  other arenas.
 Professors, for example, can profess all day long, yet the  ratio  of
 professing  to  actual doing is evidence that, while an earned degree
 indicates acquired knowledge, it does not sparkling brilliance  make.
 Perfect  grammar  does  not  make a poet, author, or philosopher. The
 capability to reproduce photographic-quality copies does not  make  a
 Painter.
        
 The  Renaissance  was  not devoid of the same pitfalls of illusion as
 today. Leonardo da Vinci complained in  his  notebooks,  "I  am  well
 aware  that  certain  presumptuous  people  think  they can slight me
 because I am not learned. But though I cannot, like them, quote  from
 all  the  best authors, it is much better and more praiseworthy to be
 well-read in the book of experience, the teacher of their teachers."
        
 It's difficult to imagine this genius being so regarded in  his  day.
 Then again...maybe not.
        
 Wouldn't  it  be  wonderful  if  most had guidelines to recognize and
 assist greatness during its time? As  evidenced  by  Lorenzo's  reign
 over  Florence,  even if only one leader has the ability to recognize
 and value that calibre of  genius  in  others,  a  civilization  will
 flourish.
        
 The  most  common misguidance of perception instilled by self-serving
 interests and perpetuated today by the media is  that  arrogance  and
 aloof  flash  ("attitude") is genius. It's an astounding phenomena to
 watch  someone  strut  on  a  stage  glowering   hateful,   arrogant,
 superiority  looks  to  the  public  be  hailed  as  "great" and paid
 millions for acting better than everyone.
        
 Conversely,  real  genius  is  being  underplayed  in  the  name   of
 "equality".   The   word   "equality"  is  abused  as  a  banner  for
 "mediocrity." Instead of the concept  being,  in  fact,  about  equal
 rights,  the  term  is  used  as  a slogan to champion "lowest common
 denominator." 'We must lower standards in the name of  equal  rights.
 In  the name of equal rights, we must not overly praise the competent
 lest others feel inferior.'
        
 What  a  misunderstanding  of  democracy   that   equal   rights   be
 misconstrued  into  the rampant fallacy rooted in fear that to excel,
 or to acclaim and perceive greatness makes another less. It does not.
 Levelling  everyone  off  to mediocrity makes everyone less. And true
 greatness,  whether  perceived  or  achieved,  by  self  or  another,
 elevates   all  who  contact  it.  Eventually  it  even  lifts  those
 incarcerated by envy. As well as being perpetrated by ignorance,  the
 fallacy  of  "nobody's  that  special"  is  also implemented by those
 intent on "cutting others down to size" for fear they will suffer  by
 comparison.
        
 It is the complete misconception of "equal rights" that mediocrity be
 championed  to  console  fear  of  inadequacy.  Beyond  it   is   the
 realization  there is nothing to fear in perceiving greatness, for in
 it we will find harmonics that serve our own essence, and the  sparks
 each of us posses!
        
 Today, as a result of the desperation to be recognized and perceived,
 there is also another disease: consuming media ambition about  "being
 great".  Yet  those  busy doing the strut miss the first step...being
 able to recognize and see greatness.
        
 We as public, in America more than any place in the  world,  are  not
 educated  in  the  appreciation  of  one  another,  life, and genius.
 Instead, we're being trained through the media to "buy more to become
 better."  Held up for veneration as our artists and heroes are mostly
 people who look at us with haughty disdain,  or  who  are  famous  no
 matter  the  reason,  be it for heinous crimes or immorality, and who
 further perpetrate the slavery-to-economics myth (gotta have lots  to
 be great). Look at the surrogate princes and madonnas of today. It is
 sad when the inversion is discovered: All groomed and dressed up with
 nothing to be great about.
        
 What  is  a  genius?  The  word  is from the stem "gen", meaning " to
 beget, create", and from "geni", a spirit. ("Genius loci" was a Latin
 term for a deity that tended a physical locality.)
        
 Mozart  was  correct  in  defining  the primary ingredient to genius:
 Love. Only from love and sincere devotion does any service or product
 have  a soul that is of value to others. Only Love patiently persists
 against all obstacles to tend excellence, to give, to contribute; and
 that's the first sign of genius: dedication and Love for duty's sake.
 The second key sign of genius:  service  to  something  greater  than
 self.  The  third  is  the  achievement  of  excellence of execution,
 performance, creation, delivery, and discovery.
        
 Creativity, the ability to make something and effect change,  is  the
 inherent  nature  of  the  human  being.  Creativity encapsulates the
 spirit of Beginning of humanity, and stems from our very origin.  Any
 creativity  contains,  therefore,  in  some  amount,  an  element  of
 "genius" - gen, begetting. That is our spirit, each and every one  of
 us.
        
 When  a  person  is  true  to  one's  self, and devoted to developing
 personal, natural talents in a given field, genius  cannot  help  but
 proportionately  develop.  Becoming prolific is inevitable when daily
 activity is dedicated  to  talent's  expression  --  be  it  science,
 sports,  music, aethetics, writing, home-making -- for the reasons of
 devotion and wish to  contribute.  The  more  genius  (genesis),  the
 greater  the  power,  whether  artistic, humanitarian, scientific, or
 familial.
        
 It could be said  that  each  individual  is  capable  of  genius  in
 different  arenas.  There  are also indisputably those about whom the
 word can be used to describe their entirety.
        
 If there is anything divine about mankind, it is genius. Lorenzo knew
 this,  and  did  not  fear  great  and  free-thinking Men. Perhaps if
 geniuses were truly recognized, others would not  fear  them  either,
 but  embrace,  exalt  and  honor  them;  their  arrival is beacon and
 reminder to the divine spark that is the essential fire  of  each  of
 us.  Genius  is  senior  to  even the mechanics of the intellect for,
 while a mind is capable of being "smart" with acquired and  organized
 knowledge  from  exterior  sources,  only  a soul is itself source of
 sheer intuit-based creation. When respected and cultivated, genius is
 a living fountain of creation; it is true and complete when rooted in
 Love and service to the greater whole.
        
 Time  proves  that  trends  and  popularity   induced   by   economic
 manipulations  are  short-lived,  synthetically  supported, they wilt
 once the marketing stops. Classics, however, are  imbued  with  their
 own  life,  imbued  with  the spark of life by their creators, who in
 turn are serving the spark universal to each of us.  Throughout  ages
 the  works of genius coax, whisper, and speak of forever because they
 speak to us about what we really are all about.
        
 The work of genius embodies principles of forever; it offers  portals
 through  which we can glimpse back to the beginning from which all is
 eternally true, and look forward to ever-new heights. Thus, the works
 are evidence that their creators ù artists, Men of science or society
 ù themselves recognize and serve something greater than themselves.
        
 If we truly see it, greatness beckons the best  within  each  of  us.
 There is no more exhilarating feeling than watching another touch the
 hem of perfection through dedicated work. That garment is somehow the
 timeless fabric of us all.
        
 One  of  the  most  efficacious things we could do for the quality of
 living  is  to  teach  ourselves  and  one  another  not   to   fear,
 misunderstand,  misidentify,  minimize,  or  neglect  genius,  but to
 recognize and embrace it,  within  ourselves  and  in  others.  Let's
 kindle  the  sparks  within  us  that  serve greatness. Genius is the
 champion,  capable  of  effulging  into  magnificent  lights  for   a
 civilization. Perceiving greatness is humbling and awesome, inspiring
 and familiar, duty and privilege ù the greater of life is served, and
 we  are  closer  to  a  civilization  based on love, problem-solving,
 service to one another, Beauty, and discovery.

                     (La prima parte e' su @{i}DADA 6@{ui})


   @{b}@{i}E VENNE IL GIORNO DEI MOSTRI DA SPIAGGIA@{ub}@{ui}
   
 Esistono pellicole che racchiudono nei loro fotogrammi il  sapore  di
 un'epoca, e talora persino di una civilta'. E' sicuramente il caso di
 un film di fantascienza del 1964, The Horror of Party  Beach  di  Del
 Tenney,  condensato  impressionante  di  tutto  il  cinema-spazzatura
 americano di quegli anni, dalle storie di motociclisti ai  mostri  di
 cartapesta  (in  questo  caso  pero'  di  stracci), dalla delinquenza
 minorile ai musicals da due soldi.  Opera,  dunque,  che  merita  una
 sorta  di  religioso rispetto (cosi' come la sua spudorata imitazione
 Monster from the Surf, girata da Jon Hall nel 1965), anche perche' di
 una  bruttezza  talmente  sconcertante  da  sfociare  nel surrealismo
 inconsapevole.

 Due parole sul regista, non piu' attivo e forse per questo per  nulla
 imbarazzato di essere ricordato come autore di bidoni innominabili. I
 film di Del Tenney sono quattro in tutto, e i loro titoli  dovrebbero
 suscitare  nel  lettore di "Urania" un particolare solletico. A parte
 il nostro Horror of... troviamo infatti Psychomania (1963), The Curse
 of  the  Living  Corpse  (1964)  e  I  Eat your Skin, noto anche come
 Invasion of the Zombies, Voodoo  Blood  Bath  o  Caribbean  Adventure
 (1971).  Va  detto,  per sincerita', che questi film non eccellono in
 bruttezza (e certo non in bellezza). Mi limitero' dunque a citare gli
 "strilli"  pubblicitari  del piu' notevole tra essi, Psychomania: "Un
 assassino pazzo  per  le  ragazze  incede  per  l'universita'!  Quale
 ragazza  sara' la prossima vittima?". Segue la descrizione (con foto)
 delle tre poverine minacciate: "La selvaggia  studentessa  di  scuola
 mista:  va  pazza per ogni uomo!", "La bella ragazza: innocente nelle
 vie dell'amore!", "La modella: per lei posare e' un  eccitante  stile
 di  vita!".  Non  riesco a immaginare il pazzo di sesso maschile che,
 letti annunci del genere, non si sia precipitato a vedere Psychomania
 (specie  per la "selvaggia studentessa di scuola mista"!). Ma veniamo
 a  Horror  of  Party  Beach.  Il  film  si  inserisce  in  un  filone
 interessante  e  succulento.  Se gli anni '50 avevano visto prevalere
 sugli schermi americani la figura del giovane ribelle  in  giacca  di
 cuoio,   alla   Marlon   Brando   o   alla  James  Dean,  il  periodo
 immediatamente successivo  assiste  all'affermazione  di  un  modello
 giovanile  molto  differente,  in  coincidenza  con una forte ripresa
 economica.  La  trasgressione  cede  il  posto  a   una   tollerabile
 disobbedienza,   la   rivolta   a  una  critica  blanda  e  assennata
 (esattamente come accade ai giorni nostri). Ecco apparire film in cui
 al  teddy  boy  perennemente  ingrugnito succede lo studente di buona
 famiglia, che nel party, nel rock'n roll e  negli  amori  in  vacanza
 scopre  una dissidenza dai contorni circoscritti e dai precisi limiti
 anagrafici.

 La pellicola capostipite e' Beach Party, del 1963, tutta permeata dal
 nuovo  look - bikini, spiagge, hula, decorazioni floreali - diffusosi
 dopo l'ingresso delle Hawaii negli Stati Uniti. Ne  seguono  in  poco
 tempo  decine  di  altre,  imperniate su amori leziosi di adolescenti
 leziosi in lezioso contesto  marino.  Per  fortuna,  una  legione  di
 mostri  e'  in  agguato,  e  spia  cio'  che  avviene nelle localita'
 balneari con occhi famelici. No, non  si  tratta  di  extraterrestri.
 Sono  i  registi  del  cinema  fantastico pezzente e scombinato, alla
 ricerca di soggetti a buon mercato utili a fare un po' di  quattrini,
 e  poter  cosi' acquistare nuova pellicola. L'avvisaglia del pericolo
 che incombe sui beach boys si ha con Pajama Party di Don Weis (1964),
 in  cui  il  marziano  Go-Go  piomba  tra i surfisti californiani per
 preparare un'invasione. Ma la catastrofe vera e propria capita subito
 dopo,  quando  esplode, per l'appunto, Horror of Party Beach. Secondo
 quanto ha  narrato  il  regista  Del  Tenney  a  Tom  Weaver  (autore
 dell'insostituibile  volume  Interviews  with  B  Science Fiction and
 Horror Movie Makers), il  soggetto  originale  doveva  riguardare  la
 trasformazione  di un pesce in un uomo -"l'uomo del futuro" - per via
 della contaminazione nucleare. Poi  la  moda  dei  film  da  spiaggia
 suggeri'  di  realizzare  il primo horror da spiaggia, con una storia
 ancora piu' balzana di quella concepita inizialmente.

 Abbiamo cosi' un gruppo di teen-agers stile Ambra che si dimenano sul
 bordo  del  mare,  al ritmo della canzone "The Zombie Stomp", cantata
 dal complessino dei Del-Aires. Ma  ecco  che  la  polluzione  atomica
 trasforma  dei  teschi, che giacevano sott'acqua (chissa' a chi erano
 appartenuti), in orribili mostri.  Orribili,  va  detto,  soprattutto
 agli  occhi di uno stilista di moda. Se la testa e' infatti un comune
 mascherone con una cresta al centro, il corpo, penosamente  sbilenco,
 e'  una  cascata  di stoffa a brandelli, che forse vorrebbe suggerire
 l'idea di un ammasso di alghe,  e  invece  suggerisce  quella  di  un
 robivecchi  caduto  in una discarica. Mentre la gioventu' bruciata se
 la spassa sulla spiaggia,  una  ragazza  piu'  bruciata  degli  altri
 (forse  selvaggia  studentessa  di scuola mista) improvvisa uno strip
 tease  a  beneficio  di  una  turbolenta  gang  di  motociclisti  che
 imperversa  nei  paraggi.  I  mostri,  si  sa,  sono  moralisti e non
 tollerano i facili costumi (vedansi le  serie  Nightmare  e  Venerdi'
 13).  Una  creatura  di  stracci  emerge  dal mare con gran spreco di
 schiuma e uccide la fanciulla poco seria. E' l'inizio di una  strage:
 una alla volta, tutte le adolescenti presenti al party cadono vittime
 degli uomini- pesce.  Ma  cio'  non  accade  tutto  di  seguito.  Per
 accrescere  la  suspence,  l'azione  e' spesso interrotta da corse in
 macchina, ulteriori esibizioni dei Del-Aires e gare di surf, come  si
 conviene alla serie Z. Per farla breve, capita che una donzella versi
 per caso una tazza di sodio addosso a uno dei  mostri  (sarebbe  bene
 avere  sempre  una  tazza  di  sodio  con  se',  per  far fronte agli
 imprevisti). La creatura fa un gran fumo e si  disintegra.  A  questo
 punto  la  via della riscossa e' segnata: inaffiati di sodio, tutti i
 mostri si dissolvono e i teen-agers possono tornare  a  dimenarsi  al
 ritmo di "The Zombie Stomp".

 Per  risparmiare  sui  costi  di casting, Del Tenney ebbe una trovata
 apparentemente brillante: con alcune casse di birra assoldo' una gang
 di teppisti in motocicletta di Stamford, Connecticut, denominata "The
 Charter  Oaks",  per  impersonare  i  cattivi  della  storia.  Ma   i
 motociclisti  erano  cattivi  davvero.  Nel  mezzo di una ripresa uno
 della gang, per mettersi  in  mostra,  fece  cadere  il  capobanda  e
 scateno' una rissa colossale, con inseguimenti in moto e speronamenti
 a  catena.  L'astuto  Tenney  avrebbe  forse  ripreso  tutto  quanto,
 sennonche'  uno  dei  teppisti travolse la macchina da presa e chi le
 stava  dietro.  L'attore  principale  fini'  all'ospedale  in   gravi
 condizioni,  gravando  il  budget  miserabile  del  film di una spesa
 imprevista. Per fortuna, i  giovani  americani  presero  d'assedio  i
 drive-ins  che  proiettavano  Horror  of  Party Beach, e Tenney pote'
 intascare un discreto gruzzoletto.

 Dopo avere visto Horror of Party Beach, uno penserebbe di avere visto
 tutto.  Non  e' cosi'. Solo un anno dopo dalle acque ribollenti della
 costa californiana emergeva sbuffando  un  nuovo  mostro  coperto  di
 stracci,  a  disturbare  l'ennesimo party sulla spiaggia (ma forse si
 trattava dello stesso party che  non  si  era  mai  interrotto).  Era
 Monster  from  the  Surf , un film letteralmente inguardabile diretto
 dall'attore Jon Hall,  qui  nella  parte  della  creatura  acquatica.
 L'aspetto e' lo stesso degli uomini-pesce del film precedente, ma con
 tre variazioni: 1) il mostro e' uno  solo;  2)  il  consueto  costume
 cencioso  e'  arricchito da due occhi ricavati da palle di ping pong,
 su cui sono state  disegnate  le  pupille  (come  fece  Petrolini  in
 occasione di una sua famosa filastrocca teatrale), nonche' da un muso
 di porco; 3)  non  e'  un  vero  mostro  marino,  bensi'  un  costume
 indossato dall'assassino per rendere piu' pittoreschi i suoi delitti,
 e farli passare inosservati. E' infatti  la  storia  dell'oceanografo
 Otto,  che insanguina i festini sulla spiaggia per motivi noti solo a
 lui, e finisce per uccidere la moglie Vicki (reduce probabilmente  da
 una  selvaggia  scuola  mista)  quando la scopre intenta a sedurre un
 aitante giovanotto. La vicenda, pero', si esaurisce in venti  minuti;
 gli  ulteriori  50  minuti  del  film  sono  infatti  riempiti con le
 prodezze di  surfisti  che  sfidano  giganteschi  cavalloni,  in  una
 profetica  anticipazione  di  Un giorno da leoni e di Point Break. Il
 tutto accompagnato da una colonna  sonora  che  fa  rimpiangere  "The
 Zombie Stomp" dei Del-Aires.

 Perito Otto nell'incendio della sua macchina sembrava  tutto  finito.
 Ma  ecco  che  le acque californiane ribolliscono nuovamente, e dagli
 abissi emerge, nella calda estate del 1966, Ghost  in  the  Invisible
 Bikini  di Don Weis, altrimenti detto Beach Party in a Haunted House.
 La penna dello storico pero' non regge davanti all'affiorare di tanta
 spazzatura,  e  cade rovesciando il calamaio. Una sola considerazione
 finale. I trash movies statunitensi degli anni Cinquanta  e  Sessanta
 saranno  anche brutti, e nel caso di quelli citati in questo articolo
 addirittura orribili. Molto  raramente  pero'  sono  squallidi,  come
 invece  capita ad analoghe produzioni europee, noiose e cupe (penso a
 Jesus Franco, ad Aristide Massaccesi, al Jean Rollin minore). Circola
 in  larga  parte  del  cinema  americano  di  serie  Z un qualcosa di
 gioioso, di vitale, di genialoide, che  apparenta  queste  produzioni
 sgangherate  a spettacoli da circo. E poiche' l'origine del cinema e'
 il baraccone da fiera, nessuno riuscira' mai a espellere  i  film  di
 rozzo  artigianato dall'anima piu' intima della settima arte, e dalla
 felicita' che riesce a procurare.
   

   @{b}@{i}PHIL TUCKER E IL ROBOT IN PELLICCIA@{ub}@{ui}
   
 Quando si parla di cinema-spazzatura,  a  chi  coltiva  questa  dolce
 perversione  viene  subito  in  mente  un  film di fantascienza cosi'
 sgangherato   da   poter   essere    considerato    l'esempio    piu'
 rappresentativo  della  specie.  Mi  riferisco  naturalmente  a Robot
 Monster (1953) di Phil Tucker, regista responsabile, due  anni  dopo,
 del quasi altrettanto scadente Cape Canaveral Monsters (1960). Per il
 resto la carriera di questo cineasta deceduto alcuni  anni  or  sono,
 eroe  della  seconda guerra mondiale (ma nei film non si vede) e gran
 bevitore (questo si vede),  conta  generici  bidoni  come  il  giallo
 insulso  Dance  Hall  Racket  (1953),  nonche'  una  serie  di  brevi
 pellicole per adulti tra cui Paris after Midnite (1950), che provoco'
 il  fallimento  del  teatro  dell'Hollywood  Boulevard  in cui veniva
 proiettata, malgrado la presenza della nota  spogliarellista  Tempest
 Storm L'apporto di Phil Tucker al cinema fantascientifico sembrerebbe
 dunque modesto, se non fosse che i suoi unici due  film  appartenenti
 al  genere ebbero un impatto tale da forare il fondo della serie Z, e
 disperdersi nella realta' sottostante in cui vagano, assieme a rotoli
 di  celluloide,  ortaggi  avariati  e scarpe vecchie. Grazie a questa
 impresa, il suo nome non impallidira' facilmente.

 Ma veniamo alla genesi di Robot Monster. Ce la  narra  Wyatt  Ordung,
 sceneggiatore  del  film  (e  l'autorevole "Fangoria", nel presentare
 l'intervista, pregusta lo stupore dei lettori nell'apprendere che  un
 film  del  genere  avesse anche una sceneggiatura). Dunque, un giorno
 Phil Tucker va da lui, in compagnia  della  moglie  Francine,  e  gli
 propone  un  lavoro (Ordung godeva di una certa reputazione per avere
 scritto Monster from the Ocean Floor e Phantom from 10.000  Leagues).
 Si  tratta  di sceneggiare un film comico, intitolato Googie-Eyes, su
 un mostro dagli occhi a palla. Ordung manifesta qualche perplessita',
 e Tucker spiega meglio la sua trovata. Il mostro sara' alle prese con
 i pochi sopravvissuti alla catastrofe nucleare.  Ordung  replica  che
 non  trova  l'idea  particolarmente  comica,  e Francine annuisce con
 vigore: "E' dall'altra notte che cerco di farglielo capire!".  Tucker
 pero'  non  si  lascia  smontare.  D'improvviso  esclama  con enfasi:
 "Ro-Man!".  "Cosa  diavolo  sarebbe  un   Ro-Man?"   chiede   Ordung.
 "L'abbreviazione di Robot-Man!" "E come sarebbe fatto?" "Non ne ho la
 minima idea." Il mostro dagli occhi a palla  e'  subito  dimenticato,
 soppiantato  dalla  nuova  trovata.  Il  Ro-Man  puo' iniziare il suo
 vacillante cammino. A questo punto anche il lettore si chiedera' come
 sia  fatto  un  Ro-Man.  E'  presto detto. Rivestite un attore di una
 pelliccia da gorilla, o comunque di qualcosa di peloso, e  mettetegli
 in testa un casco da palombaro. Poi prendete l'antennina di una radio
 e fissatela sul casco. Otterrete cosi' un Ro-Man identico a quello di
 Robot  Monster. Quanto agli accessori, uno di quei contenitori che si
 usano in campagna per  irrorare  le  piante  di  verderame  simulera'
 un'arma  dal  raggio  calcificante,  mentre  un comune walkie- talkie
 residuato di guerra, posato su un tavolo da  cucina,  permettera'  le
 necessarie  comunicazioni  intergalattiche.  Per  quanto  riguarda la
 trama del film, lascio' sbalorditi per la sua scempiaggine anche  gli
 spettatori  abituati  alle  peggiori  stranezze.  Va precisato che la
 responsabilita' di Ordung nel misfatto e', a suo dire, solo parziale.
 Il  produttore  del film, Al Zimbalist, era creditore di una somma da
 parte di un  tizio,  un  commerciante  di  mobili  con  velleita'  di
 scrittura  cinematografica.  Zimbalist  gli  cancello'  il  debito  a
 condizione che rimettesse mano alla sceneggiatura, gia'  traballante.
 Il  mobiliere  si mise diligentemente al lavoro. Cio' che combino' e'
 presto riassunto.

 Siamo in un'epoca successiva all'olocausto nucleare, che deve  essere
 stato  davvero tremendo, perche' non ci sono piu' ne' case ne' citta'
 (il film fu interamente girato nel Bronson Canyon, presso Hollywood).
 L'umanita'  e'  ridotta  a  sei  persone,  gli  Hu-  Mans  (notare la
 finezza). Si tratta di uno scienziato, di sua moglie, di due  bambini
 bruttissimi e di un giovane e una ragazza. Su loro incombe Ro-Man, il
 robot peloso presumibilmente giunto dalla luna (che, come si  sa,  e'
 popolata  da gorilla palombari). Ro-Man commette varie malefatte, tra
 cui lo strangolamento di uno dei bambini del professore  (con  grande
 sollievo  della  platea).  Sta  pero'  per  commettere  la  malefatta
 peggiore di tutte, e cioe'  sfogare  le  sue  voglie  bestiali  sulla
 moglie  dello  scienziato, quando dal walkie-talkie posato sul tavolo
 da cucina in mezzo al canyon arriva una chiamata. E' il Grande, cioe'
 il  signore  assoluto  dei Ro-Mans di luna e dintorni, molto irritato
 per il comportamento poco civile del suo subalterno.  Tanto  irritato
 che scocca un potente raggio U (bisogna sempre stare molto attenti ai
 raggi U). A questo punto vediamo citta'  in  fiamme  (che  prima  non
 c'erano), terremoti, distruzioni apocalittiche e persino una moria di
 dinosauri. Si tratta ovviamente di fotogrammi presi da altri film,  e
 nello specifico da Volo su Marte e Sul sentiero dei mostri.

 Da  notare  che  Robot  Monster  e'  parzialmente a tre dimensioni, e
 dunque teoricamente visibile solo con quegli occhialini  di  cartone,
 con una lente verde e una rossa, che ricompaiono di tanto in tanto in
 occasione di pellicole particolarmente brutte (l'ultima  che  ricordo
 e'  Lo squalo 3D) e che possono essere raccolti dai mucchietti che si
 formano all'ingresso dei cinema, gettati  da  spettatori  che  escono
 lamentandosi  per  il mal di testa. Lo speciale "tocco tuckeriano" si
 nota pero' in un dettaglio.  Per  imperizia  nel  maneggiare  il  3D,
 l'effetto  stereoscopico  non  riusci', lasciando allo spettatore due
 alternative: 1) non usare gli occhialini e vedere Robot Monster  come
 un  normale  film  bidimensionale,  pero' con le immagini sfasate; 2)
 usare gli occhialini e godersi lo spettacolo sempre a due dimensioni,
 ma colorato a sinistra di rosso e a destra di verde (o viceversa), in
 una brillante anticipazione della psichedelia.

 La pellicola venne proiettata  per  una  sola  settimana  in  qualche
 cinema di provincia, tra le proteste del pubblico che voleva indietro
 i soldi del biglietto; poi spari' dalla circolazione, e  con  essa  i
 compensi  per  chi  vi  aveva  collaborato.  Ma  Tucker, implacabile,
 sentiva che il suo destino era nella  fantascienza.  Passarono  sette
 anni  ed  ecco l'oscuro Cape Canaveral Monsters, in cui i mostri sono
 due terroristi  morti  nel  tentativo  di  sabotare  la  famosa  base
 spaziale  e  riportati  in  vita  dopo essere stati "energizzati". Ma
 quasi tutta la pellicola e' fatta di spezzoni  di  documentari  della
 NASA,  mentre la colonna sonora - ci informa Donald C. Willis, autore
 della piu' esaustiva enciclopedia del cinema horror e di fantascienza
 - e' forse la peggiore della storia.

 Vale  la  pena  ricordare  film  del  genere?  Io  non ho dubbi: si'.
 Rappresentano un'epoca felice in cui anche un disgraziato  come  Phil
 Tucker  poteva  improvvisarsi  regista,  e  un commerciante di mobili
 scrivere una sceneggiatura che non stava ne' in cielo ne'  in  terra.
 Il  belga  Jean-Pierre Bouyxou, nel suo bellissimo La science fiction
 au cine'ma, ha giustamente puntato il dito  sul  guaio  combinato  da
 Kubrick  con  2001  Odissea  nello  spazio.  Si',  certo quel film ha
 nobilitato  tutta  la  fantascienza  cinematografica  e  mandato   in
 solluchero critici sussiegosi, che fino a quel momento avevano odiato
 la sf con tutte le loro  forze.  Ma  ha  anche  fatto  sparire  dagli
 schermi  dischi  volanti  e  piante  cannibali, topiragno assassini e
 lucertoloni affamati,  uomini  talpa  e  formiche  giganti.  Da  quel
 momento  il  cinema  fantastico  ha  perso  un  po'  della  sua anima
 delirante. Volete mettere il balordo e pulcioso Ro-man col gelido HAL
 kubrickiano?  Se  davvero  preferite  il  secondo, vi meritate Johnny
 Mnemonic, e buon pro vi faccia.
   
 E' tutto, per  ora.  A  chi  fosse  interessato  al  cinemaschifezza,
 raccomando  caldamente la lettura della prima guida italiana dedicata
 al tema: Cap. Sensibol's "Trash  Cinema",  Tunnel  Edizioni,  Bologna
 1996.

 La situazione di base e' sempre la stessa.  Dopo  anni,  decenni,  di
 pratica, sono giunto ad attribuirle un nome scientifico: sindrome del
 fifty-fifty. Meta' buono, meta'  cattivo.  Meta'  luce,  meta'  buio.
 Meta'  positivo, meta' negativo. Una comoda suddivisione in due parti
 della  psiche  umana  che  di  certo  non  collima  con   le   teorie
 psicanalitiche, ma le scavalca in un impeto onnicomprensivo.
        
 Tutta quanta la narrativa fantastica, e il cinema che le e' venuto al
 seguito, poggiano su questa sindrome. Due  sono  le  vite,  diurna  e
 notturna,  del  vampiro;  due  le  facce  che  un uomo sopraffatto da
 qualche invasore alieno puo' presentare a chi lo conosce; e due,  per
 venire  al  nostro  caso,  le  personalita' di chi cada vittima della
 licantropia.
        
 Il licantropo, o uomo lupo (werewolf,  nella  dolcissima  espressione
 inglese;  dove  wolf  sta,  ovviamente,  per  lupo,  mentre wer e' un
 termine arcaico per man, uomo), e' primo cugino, se non fratello, del
 Mister  Hyde  di  Robert  Louis  Stevenson.  Un  frammento incrinato,
 slabbrato, del  vivere  civile,  del  rispetto  delle  regole,  della
 compostezza.  Dategli  una  notte  di  luna piena, e non si conterra'
 piu'... Anche se nella  vita  di  tutti  i  giorni  fosse  un  onesto
 impiegato,  un  onesto  giornalista,  magari  addirittura  un  onesto
 sindacalista. E chi puo' saperlo? Lui, certo, no.
        
 Perche' queste  frantumazioni  della  coscienza  sono  inconsapevoli.
 Sicche'  il  dottor  Jekyll  si  tramutera'  in Hyde senza rendersene
 conto; e chiunque sia stato morso da un licantropo diventera'  a  sua
 volta  lupo  mannaro;  eccetera. Lo scisma, la spaccatura in due zone
 nette, viene determinato a priori, con un grado variabile di piacere:
 alto,  ad esempio, nel caso del vampiro, e invece bassissimo nel caso
 del forzato adepto della setta dei licantropi (solo a causa dei sensi
 di  colpa imposti dai nostri retaggi culturali, ovviamente, se no non
 ci sarebbe motivo di lamentarsi).
        
 Pero', attenzione: come il dottor Jekyll va scientemente in cerca del
 proprio  fato, elaborando il diabolico intruglio che lo tramutera' in
 Hyde, e' anche possibile che qualcuno si affidi ad  antichi  compendi
 di  magia,  "grimoires" e affini, per rivestirsi della coriacea pelle
 del licantropo. Le istruzioni non mancano, e solitamente sono tra  le
 piu'  bizzarre:  ad  esempio, mangiare il cervello di un normalissimo
 lupo, oppure bere l'acqua che si raccoglie  nelle  impronte  lasciate
 sul terreno da un lupo, o ancora preparare pozioni a base di svariati
 componenti (uno dei quali, secondo una  di  queste  antiche  ricette,
 sarebbe  la  cicuta;  e  qui  corre l'obbligo di raccomandare cautela
 nelle dosi...). Eseguita una di queste  mistiche  operazioni,  l'uomo
 che desideri far spuntare in superficie la componente piu' ferina del
 proprio essere si trovera' tramutato in lupo;  e  potra'  serenamente
 godere del gusto del sangue, massimo comun denominatore che si ripete
 puntualmente nei miti di metamorfosi elaborati dalla nostra specie.
        
 La memoria puo' anche tradirmi, ma per  quanto  mi  sia  sforzato  di
 ripensare  a film e romanzi dedicati alla figura del lupo mannaro, ho
 trovato solo esempi in cui la trasformazione e' subita,  non  voluta.
 Segno  che  il  mito,  una  volta  entrato nella fase di elaborazione
 culturale, si e' assoggettato alla  regola  della  passivita',  o  se
 vogliamo  del masochismo: l'indimenticabile Larry Talbot interpretato
 da Lon Chaney Jr. era un licantropo involontario, un uomo segnato  da
 una maledizione; come, in anni piu' recenti, era del tutto non voluta
 la metamorfosi del piu' celebre licantropo del cinema  contemporaneo,
 il  giovane  protagonista  di "Un lupo mannaro americano a Londra" di
 John Landis. L'eterna maledizione, dunque. Un po' imbalsamata, un po'
 vecchiotta,            all'insegna           dell'io-ti-mordo-e-cosi'
 -diventi-mannaro-anche-tu... In effetti, a ben  scrutare  l'orizzonte
 del  fantastico,  si  ha  l'impressione  che  alcuni  miti siano piu'
 fossilizzati di altri, almeno a  livello  di  partenza;  e  che,  per
 rivitalizzarli,  sia  necessaria  l'inventiva  di un autore capace di
 nuove variazioni sul tema.
        
 Magari intrecciando ribellione giovanile,  zombismo,  e  incredulita'
 della  serafica  borghesia  inglese  come  nel film di Landis; oppure
 ipotizzando una stirpe di creature che  non  sono  uomini  mutati  in
 lupo,  ne'  lupi  normali, ma Wolfen, cioe' lupi intelligenti, veloci
 come il pensiero, spazzini dei rifiuti (umani) della grande metropoli
 contemporanea,  il  che  accade nel romanzo di Whitley Strieber e nel
 bellissimo  film  di  Michael  Wadleigh  (film  che  in  Italia,   in
 sacrosanto  omaggio a chissa' quali idiote leggi di mercato, e' stato
 distribuito solo su cassetta).
        
 Ma,  almeno  a  quanto  mi  risulta,  la  variante  piu'   originale,
 innovativa  e  rivoluzionaria  su  questo tema e' quella elaborata da
 S.P. Somtow nel romanzo "La danza della Luna": una storia  ambientata
 sul  finire  del  secolo  scorso,  nel Dakota, all'epoca della grande
 corsa alla colonizzazione del Far West americano.
        
 Somtow e' riuscito a cogliere il nocciolo della questione con estrema
 essenzialita',  senza  per  questo sminuire la portata fantastica del
 tema. Da un lato troviamo i licantropi indiani, antichi  abitanti  di
 quelle  terre,  che  hanno  con la vittima un rapporto quasi mistico,
 istintivo, telepatico; dall'altro lato,  i  licantropi  europei  (che
 hanno   come  consulente  Sigmund  Freud!),  freddi,  acculturati,  e
 fondamentalmente sadici nel loro  gusto  per  la  caccia  alla  preda
 umana.  L'inevitabile  scontro  si  chiudera'  su  una  disfatta  per
 entrambe le parti, e tutto sara' rimandato nel tempo,  a  molto  dopo
 l'epopea del West...
        
 Sono  convinto  che  questo  sia,  a  modo  suo, un romanzo terminale
 (personalmente l'ho definito  il  "Via  col  vento"  dei  licantropi)
 proprio  perche'  espone  la sostanza del mito in termini netti. E la
 vera essenza del problema e' questa: se un uomo vuole, o e' costretto
 a,  trasformarsi  in  lupo  (o vampiro, mummia immortale, misterhyde,
 alien,  eccetera),  puo'  tenere  conto  delle   proprie   coordinate
 culturali,  o  non  saranno queste stesse coordinate a fare di lui un
 licantropo  (vampiro  etc.)  scadente  e  potenzialmente  sadico?  La
 risposta  e'  un  inevitabile  si'. Per essere uomini lupo davvero in
 gamba   bisogna   spogliarsi   completamente,   al   momento    della
 trasformazione, di ogni residuo culturale umano e abbracciare in toto
 la ferinita' dell'animale; e quando si rientra nei  panni  dell'uomo,
 bisogna invece saper conservare almeno una parte della natura ferina,
 per guardare il mondo con una consapevolezza  molto  piu'  primitiva,
 diretta, concreta. Sanamente animale.
        
 In  questi  anni  si parla moltissimo, a proposito e a sproposito, di
 ecologia. Il mito del licantropo ci  ricorda,  con  le  sue  immagini
 virulente,  una  verita'  che  non  sempre viene recepita o accettata
 senza discussioni:  anche  la  cultura  puo'  essere  inquinante,  se
 interviene a modificare uno stato naturale di equilibrio, fosse anche
 il piu' feroce. La cultura puo' essere un fastidioso rumore di  fondo
 che  spezza l'armonia dei ritmi dell'universo, impedendoci di gustare
 in pieno la musica che ci scorre attorno. La musica  del  sangue  che
 sgorga dalla gola voracemente straziata della vittima del werewolf.

 Signore&signori benvenuti.

 Qui e' il vostro inviato speciale, l'inossidabile Artore Londona, che
 vi  parla:  inviato  in diretta nei meandri del Web per la recensione
 della concorrenza. Ebbene si, il Vostro redattore capo  -  il  mitico

 E quindi eccomi lanciato oltre i confini del  cosmo  conosciuto  alla
 ricerca  del  primo  sito  che  si  chiappera'  le  mie satireggianti

 Fabula aveva un vecchio indirizzo Internet (che potete trovare almeno

 Amodio  e  Fabrizio  Veutro,  ora  hanno  addirittura  registrato  il
 dominio, quindi basta un bel http://www.fabula.it. A quando con Dada?
 :)

 Comunque,  mentre  mi  siringo  l'ultimo  - ed anche primo -disco dei
 torinesi  Mau  e  la   rivoluzione,   comincio   l'esplorazione   (La
 pubblicita' a Mau e' stata fatta unicamente per la rima).

 Grafica:

 La grafica di tutto il sito e' molto bella: essenziale ed ergonomica.
 Unico neo e' la scelta dei colori: capita che non venga segnalata  la
 selezione  delle  pagine  in  cui  si  e' gia' passati, ovvero i link
 selezionati non cambiano di colore; in realta' ci cambiano, ma di  un
 blu  talmente  sfumato  da essere irriconoscibile (ho navigato con un
 monitor NEC 3D ed una sedicina di bit di colore. Forse  con  solo  16
 colori  la  situazione cambia :) ). E cio' puo' creare un pochetto di
 imbarazzo&confusione.

 Il sito in generale:

 Purtoppo parte del sito non  e'  abilitata,  e  precisamente  sezioni
 quali: GUESTBOOK, COMMENTI AI TESTI, MAILING LIST, APOTHEKE, LIBRERIA
 DI FABULA. Di alcune non ho la  piu'  pallida  idea  sul  loro  scopo
 (apotheke ?), per altre, tipo la possibilita' di mandare un commento,
 la cosa e'  molto  allettante.  E'  per  lo  piu'  prevista  la  loro
 attivazione  per fine settembre. Altri piccoli problemini - vedi dopo
 - ci sono, ma questo mina solo in minima parte l'ottimo  lavoro:  non
 so  se  avete mai provato a fare pagine Web di una certa complessita'
 ed estensione con i software attuali; se si potete in parte perdonare
 queste piccolezze. Un piccolo neo va alla bacheca, in cui (ad agosto)
 sono presenti unicamente concorsi che  scadevano  ad  aprile  '96  :)
 Forse  perche'  il  megadirettore  e'  sotto naja ed ha avuto qualche
 problemino... La ricerca e la presentazione degli argomenti risultano
 comunque sempre piacevoli ed interessanti.

 C'era una volta una BBS:

 Chissa'  quanti  conoscono  le  BBS.  Se non le conoscete riempite la
 vostra laguna (o mailatemi), fatto sta che Fabulus era gia' in  piedi
 da  quanddo  c'erano le BBS e questo e' un ottimo esempio di come sia
 la tecnologia al servizio dell'uomo. Non viceversa. Troppe  BBS  sono
 cadute nello sconforto all'arrivo di Internet. E' bello vedere questa
 combattivita'. Mi commuove. La BBS e' comunque viva&vegeta.

 Gli archivi:

 C'e' un archivio di inediti a cui si accede tramite un primo menu che
 li divide per argomenti: AFORISMI, DIARI, GNOMICA, ARCHIVI PERSONALI:
 LIBRI,  DISCHI,  FILM,  ECC,  BIBLIOGRAFIE,  EROTICA,   FANTASCIENZA,
 HORROR,   FANTASY,  IPERTESTI,  NARRATIVA  -  RACCONTI,  NARRATIVA  -
 ROMANZI, POESIA eccetera A fianco ad ognuno e' segnato il  numero  di
 racconti  che la libreria contiene (sarebbe interessante uno studio a
 riguardo, alcune aree hanno un numero veramente enorme rispetto  alla
 media). Ho scelto un argomento a caso, l'erotica. Al suo interno c'e'
 la selezione dei testi con un breve commento per ognuno. Molto bello,
 anche  se  questo  per  lo  piu' racconta la trama del racconto (beh,
 almeno qualcuno l'ha letto) e sarebbe stato piu' bello un  brano  del
 pezzo,  per  vedere  al  volo il tipo di stile dell'autore. Ma questi
 sono gusti personali e so che i miei sono  particolarmente  affinati.
 All'interno  dell'erotica  ho  scelto:  la  mia prima esperienza. E -
 sfiga vuole - chiappo  proprio  un  testo  che  non  c'e'  tutto,  si
 interrompe   nel  bel  mezzo  di  una  frase  (non  una  scena  clou,
 fortunatamente!). Ecco, sarebbe bello mettere alla fine dei testi  un
 qualche  marchio  di fine, altrimenti uno non e' mai sicuro di averlo
 scaricato tutto; che so io, una di quelle righe orizzontali  o  cosa.
 Comunque  il  testo  e'  a  meta',  ma non ne ho trovati altri cosi'.
 Carino. Insomma la qualita', per quello che ho  letto,  e'  discreta,
 anche  se  non  proprio arrapante. Molto interessante la storia delle
 informazioni sugli autori.

 La rivista:

 Intanto il bello e' che si puo' tirare giu'  la  versione  zippata  e
 leggersela  a  casa  con  calma:  c'e'  un  po' di casino a creare le
 directory (bisogna leggersi un attimo un  HTML)  per  vedere  poi  le
 immagini della rivista al loro posto, ma si sa: non si devono fare le
 cose  troppo  facili!  Comunque  mi  cade  subito  l'occhietto  sulla
 recensione  di Elianto, l'ultimo capolavoro di Benni (come si dice in
 questo caso). Recensito da Bad'e. E  lo  stronca.  Mentre  esalta  La
 compagnia dei celestini. Vabbe', e' un critico ed i critici - ovunque
 - non capiscono mai un cazzo: buoni solo a raccontarti la  trama  per
 filo  e  per  segno  per farti vedere che hanno letto il libro. Passo
 oltre. Si parla poi di Pennac, di Cyberpunk ed altri libri.  Mi  vien
 voglia  di spedire una recensione :) Insomma niente male. Poi ci sono
 recensioni di dischi, molto vasta, anche classica. Mi  cade  l'occhio
 sugli  Ustmamo',  esaltati  nel  loro  ultimo  disco. Mah! Ah gia': i
 critici non capiscono un cazzo! :) Poi c'e' cinema, scienza, poesia e
 chi piu' ne ha piu' ne metta. Niente sesso, strano visto che parliamo
 di cultura. Comunque una rivista proprio piacevole.

 Conclusioni:

 Una rivista piacevole, un sito onesto. Si vede un po' che  e'  "fatto
 in casa", ma cio' non disturba, anzi! Rasserena e rende bene cio' che
 vuole essere il tutto: uno scambio di idee, un fermento  culturale  e
 sociale  della  cosa.  Sara'  molto  interessante  quando si potranno
 lasciare  commenti  sui  testi,  partecipare  a   news   (gruppi   di
 discussione)  e  -mirabilia  -  riuscire  a fare chat (chiacchiere in
 diretta).

 Insomma se navigate fateci un salto, ne vale la pena.

 Alla prossima.
 Artore Londona.

                            @{i}di Guildenstern@{ui}


 Qual e' il significato della poesia alle soglie del duemila? Qual  e'
 il  compito,  se  ne rimane uno, che e' ancora demandato alla poesia?
 Non si tratta affatto di questioni secondarie. Ci sembra che da molti
 settori  provenga  una sorte di rispetto per quest'arte, che un tempo
 fu l'Arte per antonomasia, che assomiglia un po' al rispetto  che  si
 ha  di  fronte  ad  una  persona, che magari si e' sempre considerata
 mediocre, che sta morendo e che quindi merita rispetto  per  il  solo
 fatto  di  essere  morente. Cosi' la poesia, sebbene nessuno lo possa
 dichiarare  apertamente,  oggi  e'  decisamente  considerata  un'arte
 morente.

 Vi  sono  diversi motivi. Il primo, cui non serve nemmeno soffermarsi
 piu' di tanto, ma che e' altresi' il piu' urgente, e' che  la  poesia
 non fa audience. E quindi non c'e' un mercato dietro la poesia - oggi
 i libri di poesia vendono solo nelle collane a mille lire. Non  tento
 neppure  di  percorrere  la  strada  delle  cause che hanno portato a
 questa situazione, mi  limito  a  riportarla  nella  sua  tragicita':
 niente  mercato, niente sponsor, niente arte. Per quale motivo dovrei
 dedicarmi  a  tempo  pieno  alla  poesia  se  questa   scelta   porta
 necessariamente   all'indigenza?  Il  discorso  naturalmente  e'  ben
 diverso per la scrittura in prosa.

 Il secondo  motivo,  forse  piu'  interessante  dal  punto  di  vista
 dell'analisi  che  sto tentando, e' quello del sorgere o risorgere di
 arti che nei secoli passati erano minoritarie rispetto  alla  poesia.
 Sto  parlando  della  canzone  e  della  danza. Oggi nei concerti dei
 cantautori, per rimanere nel campo dell'arte, si  danno  appuntamento
 fino  a  centomila persone. Per gli spettacoli di danza, anche quelli
 piu' scadenti, si arriva fino a  mille,  duemila  presenze.  La  cosa
 triste  e'  che  a  sentir recitare Alda Merini, forse la piu' grande
 poetessa italiana vivente, eravamo si' e no una cinquantina. Il terzo
 ed  ultimo motivo, fra quelli evidenti, e' la concorrenza di una sola
 arte che oggi e' l'unica che praticamente muove l'intero settore  del
 divertimento,  o  entertainment  come  si  dice  nei  paesi di lingua
 anglosassone, nel pianeta: la cinematografia. Questa, nei casi in cui
 e' certamente arte in quanto creazione originale di una mente umana e
 volta alla ricerca del bello e del piacere in se',  e'  a  tutti  gli
 effetti  una  concorrente  della poesia: ma e' indiscutibilmente piu'
 fruibile, piu' spettacolare, piu' facile, anche quando si  tratti  di
 opere  estremamente  complesse  e articolate come lo possono essere i
 film  di  Kieszlowskij  o  quelli   di   Godard,   per   citare   due
 autori/registi  affatto diversi. Mi sembra dunque di vedere la poesia
 affossata e resa moribonda da tutti i motivi che ho sopra  rozzamente
 elencato,  e  guardata  con  patetica  misericordia da chi, sapendola
 spacciata, le offre l'estremo saluto.

 La realta', fortunatamente, mi sembra ben diversa.  Mi  sembra  cioe'
 che  nei  due  fronti  della  lettura  e della scrittura della poesia
 qualcosa si stia muovendo e che dopo un decennio di stasi  pressoche'
 assoluta  le  acque  tornino  finalmente  a  muoversi.  Esistono  due
 indicatori, principalmente, di questo stato  di  cose:  il  crescente
 numero  di  autori  validi  under  30  e il crescente interesse che i
 giovanissimi, la generazione nata tra il 75 e  l'80  per  intenderci,
 mostrano per la poesia nella sua accezione piu' semplice, vale a dire
 la mera composizione in versi. Interesse per la vera poesia,  dunque,
 e  non  quello stantio e inesplicabile timore reverenziale che era da
 tributare ai padri della poesia che veniva insegnato essere da Poesia
 stessa  da una certa schiera di professori delle scuole superiori che
 forse avevano smarrito il senso dello scrivere poesia, e  quindi  del
 piacere  che essa certamente doveva portare con se'. Eliminato questo
 piacere dionisiaco che la vera poesia porta  allegato,  ecco  che  il
 rimanente  puzza di banchi di scuola e di inutile. Ecco che mi capita
 di vedere ragazzini con in mano Whitman, con in mano Lord Byron,  con
 in  mano  Rimbaud. E non vedo nessuno intorno a loro che, con intenti
 pseudo-pedagogici, quando non addirittura politici, cerca di  spiegar
 loro quelle rime. E capiscono da loro che esse sono energia, piacere,
 godimento, estasi, bellezza e orgasmo allo stato puro.

 E poi nuovi, profondissimi,  bravissimi,  coraggiosi  poeti  giovani.
 Tutti  loro sembrano mettere in atto il famoso verso di Walt Whitman:
 "Walt, tu hai molto dentro di te, perche' non lo getti fuori?"  (Song
 of   myself,  XXV).  Ne  trovate  alcuni  su  queste  pagine,  queste
 pseudopagine  telematiche,  altri  li  trovate  nelle   pubblicazioni
 specialistiche  rivolte  alla  poesia e alla letteratura. Mi limito a
 sottolineare il grande  lavoro  di  selezione  e  di  promozione  dei
 giovani  artisti  che  il circuito GAI (Giovani Artisti Italiani) sta
 facendo in tutte le discipline artistiche e anche nella poesia.  Ecco
 quindi  che  un  moto  di  rinascita  sembra permeare le membra della
 morente poesia. E l'arte  difficile,  l'arte  incomprensibile  e  per
 mochi  eletti,  torna  lentamente alla luce. Questa rinascita, questo
 ottenere dignita' attraverso nuove forme e' il compito della  poesia,
 di  quella  mondiale,  nel  nuovo  millennio.  Il significato, pero',
 rimane quello di sempre:  ed  e'  la  dedizione  completa,  libera  e
 profonda alla parola.

                          @{i}by Antonio Bellomi@{ui}


 Manlio Locatelli non amava affatto quel  posto.  Intanto,  non  amava
 affatto  il  caldo.  Le  sue vacanze le aveva sempre passate in amene
 localita', ricche di pini e  di  scroscianti  torrenti,  e  solo  una
 volta,  attratto  al  seguito  di una bionda incendiaria, aveva osato
 calcare le spiagge di Tropea. Ma poi la bionda si  era  rivelata  una
 delusione e il caldo micidiale del sud pure.

 Cosi' adesso il posto in cui si trovava non gli piaceva affatto. Dopo
 tutto, l'Inferno e' gia' brutto di suo, ma il  girone  delle  fiamme,
 per  uno  che ama le pinete, non e' decisamente la quintessenza della
 felicita'.

 Ora, tutto ingrugnito, Manlio Locatelli  stava  meditando  su  quella
 dannata  sbandata  che  gli aveva fatto volare lo spider giu' per uno
 strapiombo, con conseguente trasloco immediato negli  Inferi,  quando
 davanti gli si paro' la torva sagoma del Padrone in persona.

 "Satana!" esclamo' Manlio Locatelli, mentre una fiamma gli lambiva il
 tallone destro e una goccia di sudore gli scivolava giu' per il naso.

 "Ah,ah ecco qui il mio nuovo arrivato," sogghigno' beffardo il grande
 Satana  brandendo  il tridente. Il pizzetto di barba caprina appariva
 ben  curato  e  Manlio  si  chiese  quanto  fosse  vanesio   il   suo
 proprietario.

 "Gradisci  l'ospitalita'?"  gli  chiese  con premurosa cordialita' il
 demonio.

 "O hai qualche lamentela da fare sulla gestione? La cucina e' di  tuo
 gusto? Il beveraggio e' passabile?"

 Manlio  Locatelli  saltello'  sui  piedi per sfuggire alle fiamme che
 cercavano di aggredirlo anche in quel punto meno esposto di altri che
 era finalmente riuscito a trovare.

 "Secondo  me,  non funziona bene il condizionamento," sbotto' col suo
 solito tono strafottente che neanche l'Inferno era ancora  riusito  a
 mitigare  e  senza  riflettere  sulle possibili conseguenze della sua
 lamentela. "Fa sempre troppo caldo!"

 La coda del demonio volteggio' nell'aria e gli frusto'  con  violenza
 le  gambe  nude,  lasciandogli  una bella vescica rossa. "Spiritoso!"
 ruggi' Satana

 "Mi sei proprio simpatico. Potrei anche contraccambiarti se mi fai un
 favore."

 "Un favore?" chiese Manlio. "Di che genere?"

 Il  demonio  si  accarezzo'  la  barbetta  caprina  e  uno scintillio
 indefinibile gli brillo' negli occhi. "Ricordo male, o tu sei proprio
 quel  bercione  che sulla terra andava dicendo di saper trasmutare il
 piombo in oro?"

 Manlio lo guardo',  parecchio  stupito  di  quella  domanda.  "Tu  lo
 dovresti  sapere  bene,  caro  il mio Satanasso. Io sono un autentico
 alchimista. Un alchimista dei tempi moderni che ha trovato la  pietra
 filosofale  da  tutti cercata e da nessuno mai rivenuta. E ricorderai
 anche che sono finito qui perche' ho stretto un patto  faustiano  con
 te!"

 "Ah, ah, ah... gia' ora ricordo," ridacchio' il demonio. "Tu eri quel
 tizio che si credeva  piu'  furbo  di  me.  Ti  sei  fatto  dare  dal
 sottoscritto  la  dritta  per  arrivare  alla  pietra filosofale e in
 cambio ti sei dichiarato disposto a darmi la tua anima... al  termine
 del  tuo  "itinere",  come dicesti tu con irriflessiva leggerezza. Ti
 sono sempre piaciute le parole difficili per fare colpo sui gonzi."

 Manlio Locatelli fece una smorfia. "Gia', e tu  due  giorni  dopo  mi
 facesti volare in un burrone con la spider."

 Il  demonio  si  mise  a  ridere  e le spalle gli sussultarono per le
 risate. "Gia', era il tuo itinere vacanziero... stavi andando a zonzo
 per le Dolomiti, se ben ricordo".

 Il  fu  alchimista  dottor  Manlio Locatelli, ex brillante docente di
 chimica all'Universita' di Milano, lo guardo' imbronciato. "Mi  avevi
 parlato di un favore, se non sbaglio."

 "Infatti."  Satana si appoggio' al tridente e lo fisso', riflettendo.
 "Ti propongo un affare. Io devo costruire un nuovo girone, quello dei
 tangentari  politici.  Ormai  non  posso  piu'  ospitarli negli altri
 cerchi perche' scoppiano. E con tutta quella faccenda di Tangentopoli
 ho bisogno di uno spazio nuovo tutto per loro."

 "E io che c'entro?" chiese Manlio Locatelli.

 "Tu c'entri, c'entri," disse Satana con bonomia. "Perche' quel che mi
 serve e' un bel girone pieno di oro fuso in cui far crogiolare quella
 brava gente."

 Il  viso  dell'ex  alchimista  si  illumino'. "E io dovrei procurarti
 l'oro necessario, giusto?"

 "Giusto!" ruggi' il demonio. "Non vorrai che vada  a  procuramelo  in
 banca.  Con  quello  che te lo fanno pagare col cambio del dollaro! E
 sta' lira che un giorno va giu' e l'altro pure!"

 L'idea era allettante, ma c'era un punto che non convinceva del tutto
 Manlio  Locatelli.  "Senti  un po'," disse sospettoso. "Non e' che mi
 stai prendendo in giro? Tu di alchimisti dovresti averne  a  bizzeffe
 qua dentro. Perche' ti rivolgi proprio a me?"

 "Alchimisti,  alchimisti..."  brontolo' Satana. "Tu fai presto a dire
 alchimisti, ma sono tutti ciarlatani. Cialtroni che in passato  hanno
 saputo  darla  a  bere  a  chi era piu' ignorante di loro. Anche quel
 tizio, come si chiama... Caglia...Caglio..."

 "Cagliostro," disse Manlio  Locatelli,  pronunciando  quel  nome  con
 venerazione.

 Satana   agiro'   il  tridente,  incollerito.  "Si',  proprio  lui...
 Cagliosto! Un furbastro di tre cotte,  lascialo  dire  a  chi  se  ne
 intende.  Se  sapessi  che  casino mi ha combinato! Ma gliel'ho fatta
 pagare sai... adesso e' a far compagnia alla dolce Taide."

 L'ex dottor Manlio  Locatelli  a  quel  punto  si  senti'  lusingato.
 Perfino Satanasso riconosceva la sua perizia. Che diamine! Quella era
 la fama. "E se accetto?" chiese, col cuore  in  tumulto.  Ah,  se  un
 giorno un novello Dante avesse passeggiato nel girone dei tangentari!

 Satana lo fisso' negli occhi. "Tu preparami un impianto di produzione
 dell'oro da metallo vile, qualcosa di economico che non costi troppo,
 e  soprattutto  che  funzioni  alla  perfezione e ti potrai godere di
 qualche giorno di frescura.

 "Qualche giorno e' troppo poco," ribatte' sostenuto Manlio Locatelli,
 attento  a  non  far trasparire un sussulto di gioia a quell'offerta.
 Tutto, tutto, pur di stare qualche giorno lontano dalle  fiamme.  Ah,
 che bello!

 "Niente favoritismi," replico' il demonio. Tu mi dai qualcosa e io ti
 pago. Ma per un lavoretto che per uno genio come te e' una bazzecola,
 che  cosa  pretendi?  Il  clima  delle Dolomiti, forse? Ricordati che
 questo e' l'inferno!"

 Satana appariva davvero seccato e  per  un  attimo  Manlio  Locatelli
 temette che se ne andasse, portandosi via anche l'offerta.

 "Me  ne  ricordo,  sta  tranquillo," disse Manlio. " Ma non dirmi che
 anche qui non ci sono i raccomandati. Sai, magari  un  angolino  piu'
 fresco  di  questo  potresti  anche  trovarmelo.  In fin dei conti ti
 faccio  un  lavoretto  che  e'  vitale   per   una   buona   gestione
 dell'azienda."

 "Argh!" Satana emise un versaccio satanico e fece roteare il tridente
 come per trafiggere l'impudente.

 Manlio  Locatelli  fece  un  balzo  all'indietro.  "Ehi,  adagio  con
 quell'arnese  o  dovrai rinunciare al tuo unico alchimista provetto!"
 Le punte del tridente gli sfiorarono la  gola  poi  di  colpo  Satana
 emise una gran risata.

 "E va bene! Te l'ho detto che mi sei simpatico! Cinque gradi ti vanno
 bene?"

 "Perche' non dieci..." avanzo' timidamente Manlio, ma Satana emise un
 altro  versaccio  e  il tridente torno' a volteggiare pericolosamente
 vicino alla testa del fu dottor Manlio Locatelli.

 "Cinque! Prendere o lasciare!" ruggi' il demonio.

 "Accetto...accetto..." fece  precipitosamente  marcia  indietro  l'ex
 alchimista.  Dopo  tutto  cinque  gradi  gli  andavano benissimo. Che
 diamine!

                                  ***

 Per cinque giorno Manlio  Locatelli  lavoro'  come  un  ossesso,  tra
 storte,  alambicchi,  becchi Bunsen e moderni forni a microonde senza
 concedersi un attimo di pausa. Il girone dell'oro doveva essere molto
 grande,  visto  il  dinamismo di certi giudici e molti dei tangentari
 non erano piu' giovanissimi, per cui  non  c'era  tempo  da  perdere.
 Purtroppo lui non poteva contare sull'aiuto di nessuno. Logico quindi
 che ci fosse tanto  da  fare.  Ma  il  miraggio  del  fresco  era  un
 incentivo  potente e quando il primo lago di oro fuso si riverso' nel
 girone,  facendo  salire  di  colpo  la  temperatura  a  un   livello
 intollerabile, si affretto' a presentarsi da Satana.

 "Okay,  capo"  gli  disse  col  suo solito tono strafottente. "La mia
 parte l'ho fatta. Adesso a te la tua!"

 "Proprio un bel lavoro,"  ammise  Satana  con  un  sorrisetto  furbo,
 rimirando  il  ribollente  torrente aureo. "E' proprio il nido ideale
 per i tangentari. Ih... come urleranno! Lo dicevo che eri un drago."

 "Modestamente...." fece Manlio. "Ma adesso..."

 "Adesso... eccoti la ricompensa!" disse Satana facendo schioccare  la
 coda  e  Manlio  Locatelli  si senti' afferrare da un turbine di aria
 gelida che lo scaravento' su un lastrone di  ghiaccio  in  una  pozza
 senza fine.

 "Ehi!"   grido'   Manlio  Locatelli,  indignato  "Le  promesse  vanno
 mantenute!" Mi avevi garantito cinque gradi e qui ce ne  sono  almeno
 venti di meno! Io protesto!"

 Dopo  tutto  se  il  caldo  caldo era insopportabile, anche il freddo
 freddo lo era altrettanto. Che senso aveva cadere dalla  padella  nel
 freezer?

 Dall'alto  del  pozzo  senza  fine  si  senti' la risata del demonio.
 "Protesta respinta, mio caro. Satana ti aveva promesso cinque gradi e
 cinque gradi hai avuto. Satana mantiene sempre le sue promesse."

 "Qui  non  ci  sono  cinque  gradi,  te lo garantisco!" grido' Manlio
 Locatelli con quanto fiato aveva in gola. "Di temperature  io  me  ne
 intendo," aggiunse indignato. "Con chi credi di avere a che fare?"

 Dall'alto  si  udi'  ancora  una  volta  la  risata satanica "Oh,si',
 invece, mio  caro,  ci  sono  cinque  gradi  esatti...  cinque  gradi
 Fahrenheit   ...   che   fanno  esattamente  ...meno  quindici  gradi
 centigradi! Ciao, merlo!"

 Manlio Locatelli didn't like that place. For one, he didn't like  hot
 climate. He had always spent his holidays in fine places, where pines
 and roaring torrents abounded,  and  only  once  ,  taken  in  by  an
 explosive  blonde, had he dared to tread the sandy beaches of Tropea,
 in the South of Italy. But, then, the blond had proved to be as big a
 disappointment as had been the killing heat of the South.
        
 That  was why by all means he didn't like that place. After all, Hell
 is an ugly  place  by  itself,  but  the  circle  of  the  flames  is
 definitely not the top of happiness for one who loves pine woods.
        
 Now  a  sulky  Manlio  Locatelli was pondering on the day his damn...
 (OOPS, this is a dangerous word here,  he  thought)  sports  car  had
 skidded  on  the  slippery road and had plummeted down a ravine, with
 his immediate transfer into the pits of Hell, when the grim shape  of
 the Master appeared before him.
        
 "Satan!"  Manlio  Locatelli exclaimed, while a flame licked his right
 heel and a drop of sweat ran down his nose.
        
 "Ha,  ha!  Here  is  my  new  guest,"  the  big  Satan  scorned  him,
 brandishing  his trident. His short goatish beard looked well trimmed
 and Manlio wondered whether its proprietor was so vain as he looked.
        
 "Do you like the premises?"  the  demon  asked  him  with  solicitous
 warm-heartiness.  "Or  do  you  have  some  complaint to do about the
 management?"
        
 Manlio Locatelli bounced on his feet to avoid the flames  that  tried
 to attack him. He had at last found a sheltered nook where the flames
 where less fierce then elsewhere, but he always  had  to  be  careful
 anyway.
        
 "In  my  opinion,  the conditioning is not so..." he was about to say
 'hot', but he refrained. Bad choice of words, again. Instead he  said
 "...  so  efficient."  He spoke with his usual drawl of impudent punk
 that not even Hell had taken away from him. Then, without thinking of
 the possible consequences of his complaint he added, "It's always too
 hot!"
        
 The tail of the demon slashed through the air and whipped  his  naked
 legs  fiercely. A big red welt appeared. "Funny!" Satan roared. "Real
 funny! I like you. I could even pay you back if you do me  a  favour.
 After all, I feel good today. It is Christmas time."
        
 "Christmas  time?"  Manlio  Locatelli wondered. "I lost track of time
 down here. Do you give presents on Christmas?"
        
 "Sort of," the devil said enigmatically. "Well then, you were talking
 about  a  favour..."  "Oh,  yeah. I need a little work by you, and in
 turn I could give you a real present for Christmas. A big present."
        
 Manlio Locatelli did not hesitate. "Shoot then."
        
 "Well," the devil said."You were a computer whiz  on  Earth,  weren't
 you?" Manlio was taken aback by that question. "Exactly."
        
 "Well, then you are quite familiar with software bugs, aren't you?"
        
 "Sort of," Manlio Locatelli answered non-committal.
        
 Satan  leaned on his trident. "Well then, I propose you a business. I
 have a problem with the software which runs  the  premises.  I  think
 there is a bug planted somewhere by the engineer who wired the place.
 He tried to play smart, but was not  smart  enough..."  he  concluded
 with  a  grimace.  Locatelli  shuddered  and  dared not ask where the
 engineer had been sent to. He was sure he  wouldn't  have  liked  the
 answer.
        
 "Therefore,"  the  devil continued, "first rule, play honest with me.
 No trick, no funny ideas. You understand?"
        
 "Oh, sure," Manlio said.
        
 "The problem is in the circle of ice. The water leaks  somewhere  and
 when  it arrives it is not properly iced. This way the damned are not
 freezing properly. They are just making a corroborating shower.  This
 is  where  you  come in. You find out the bug in the software and you
 will enjoy a fine Christmas present. A few days of mild climate."
        
 "A few days is too short a time," Manlio Locatelli retorted.  He  was
 able  not  to show any joy at that offer. Everything, everything just
 to stay away from the fires for a few days! Ha,  even  the  ice  cold
 freeze sounded beautiful.
        
 "No  free  gift," the devil replied. "I can't do that. I can only pay
 for something you do. And I can only pay  the  right  price.  Anyway,
 what  would  you want? The climate of the Alps, perhaps? Be satisfied
 with a few days. Remember that this is Hell, after all!"
        
 Satan looked very angry and for a moment Manlio Locatelli was  afraid
 he  had carried too far and the devil could go away, taking his offer
 with him.
        
 "Oh, I remember it well, sure," Manlio said. "But don't tell me  that
 there  are  no  favourites  here. You know, you might find me a place
 just a mite cooler than here. After all, I am going to do a nice  job
 for  you,  a job which is necessary for the correct management of the
 firm."
        
 "Argh!" The devil shouted a Satanic sound and twirled his trident  as
 if he wanted to spit the impudent punk.
        
 Manlio Locatelli bounced back. "Hey, you pay attention with that fork
 or you'll have to look for a new computer man!"  The  points  of  the
 trident grazed his throat; then Satan's laughter roared.
        
 "Okay,  you got it. I told you I like you. Do five degrees sound good
 to you?"
        
 "Why not ten..." Manlio put in shyly, but Satan shouted angrily again
 and the trident danced dangerously near the face of the man.
        
 "Five! Take it or leave it!" the devil roared.
        
 "I  take  it...I  take it," said Manlio Locatelli, backing full-speed
 astern.  Five  degrees  were  okay  for  him,  after  all!  What  the
 h...(Hey!)" He half slipped again!
        
                                  ***
        
 For   five   days   Manlio   Locatelli    went    on    disk-driving,
 software-debugging,  data-imputing,  computer-testing without resting
 for a moment. The ice circle was a large one  and  the  computer  net
 very  old.  No  wonder then there was so much to do. But, as the work
 progressed, the temperature became less and less agreeable. If at the
 beginning,  after the hotness of fire, the coolness of the ice circle
 -  where  there  was  almost  no  ice  any  more   because   of   the
 malfunctioning  equipment  -  had been pleasant, now that the ice had
 come back, the place had become inhospitable  and  Manlio  found  out
 that  if  the  hottest  weather  is a bad thing, top cold is none the
 better either. This is why he hurried to  finish  his  work  and  the
 sixth day he went to Satan.
        
 "Okay, boss," he said. "I did my share. Now yours!"
        
 "Just  a nice piece of work," Satan admitted with a cunning smile. "I
 knew that you were a top computer man."
        
 "I know my way around..." Manlio said. "But now..."
        
 "Now...here is you reward!" Satan replied with a whiplash of his tail
 and  Manlio  Locatelli was seized off his feet by a whirlpool of cold
 air that crashed him onto an ice slab in a bottomless pit.
        
 "Hey!" Manlio shouted indignantly. "Promises are promises and must be
 kept.  You had guaranteed me five degrees and here there are at least
 twenty degrees less! I protest!"
        
 From the high mouth of the pit he could  hear  the  laughter  of  the
 devil.  "Overruled,  my  dear  fellow.  Satan  had  promised you five
 degrees and five degrees you had. There is nothing to  object  about.
 Didn't  I  tell  you  that  I feel good for Christmas? Well, today is
 Christmas and you had your present."
        
 "Five degrees my foot, I tell you!" Manlio Locatelli shouted with all
 the voice he had. "If you feel good as you said..."
        
 The  satanic  laughter  roared down again the funnel of the pit. "Oh,
 yes, my precious helper. I feel certainly good in this season...  but
 only  as  good as you can be in Hell. This is my Christmas present to
 you. You have got your  five  degrees...FIVE  FAHRENHEIT  DEGREES  of
 course...which are exactly ...MINUS FIFTEEN CELSIUS DEGREES! Bye-bye,
 sucker!"

                            @{b}"NUMBER SEVEN"@{ub}

                    @{i}A true story by Joseph Woodard@{ui}


                                - I -

 Yun sits at a gray formica-covered table in the  visiting  room.  She
 wears  her  dark  slacks, a short-sleeved, pale blue silk blouse, and
 thin red slippers embroidered with yellow and green spirals.  Tendons
 and  veins  under  the  skin  of her thin forearms extend to her long
 fingers. All of her fingernails are chipped or broken. She  tries  to
 comb her page-boy hair with those fingers, then lays her hands on the
 table. On  Sunday  visitors  are  allowed  to  see  patients  in  the
 psychiatric  wing  at  Alta  Bates  hospital in Berkeley, California.
 Patients sit at other tables or stand by the large windows talking to
 their  visitors in semi-private tones, long past embarrassment. Words
 mix with sunlight. Yun presses  her  hands  together  and  plays  the
 fingers  off  against  each  other.  She stares at them and tells her
 visitor why everything is so hard. The social worker made her stay in
 the  hospital.  She  had  bad  thoughts.  They  frightened the social
 worker.

 Yun  refers  to  Canton  Province  as  Main  China,   the   scattered
 inseminations  of  Chinese  outside  its borders being somehow lesser
 children, like Yun herself. Her real name in Chinese  actually  means
 Number Seven, as if she were an accounting entry, not a person.

 Yun  Lee was born the seventh daughter of a businessman in Canton. He
 was wealthier than most, wealthy enough to afford a wife in China and
 another  in  Hong  Kong. The mother in Main China failed to produce a
 son. Too many daughters were a liability. Yun was Number Seven,  only
 another  cheap  little  girl.  Number  Seven, and seven were too many
 girls. The father would have to put Yun to work  if  she  was  to  be
 worth  anything.  The  wife  in Hong Kong produced boys. Yun's father
 moved there. Better to reign over children who were worth  something.
 He  took  Yun.  His  happier household could save money by not hiring
 another maid. Yun would do  that  work.  She  was  small,  but  wiry,
 determined.  She  kept  her  anger in check when the step mother beat
 her.

 Number Seven, come here. Number Seven,  clean  these  floors.  Number
 Seven,  you  are  always  sleepy. What a lazy girl. You'd better work
 harder.

 Yun worked on her knees to clean steps with  a  brush  and  lye.  She
 struck  at  pavement  with  her  brush until she scraped the bristles
 loose from the wooden handle.

 Number Seven, hurry up. Lazy girl. Hurry. Carry  the  rice  into  the
 kitchen.  Lazy  Number Seven. You are ugly. You must work if you want
 to eat. You are lucky we don't sell you.

 Yun was lucky. Her father survived the revolution with  most  of  his
 fortune  safely stashed in Hong Kong. He remained shrewd. When he had
 to pay a debt to a business partner, he convinced the  partner's  son
 to take Number Seven as payment.

 I  am  in  love  with  a  beautiful young woman, pleaded the son. She
 doesn't want to marry me yet, but I will wait.

 You are idealistic and foolish, his father explained. How  long  will
 she love you if you don't prosper? You have to make money.

 Yun's  father  counseled  the  son,  She will bring you good luck, my
 Number Seven. She will do whatever you tell her. Look  how  obedient.
 See  how  clean the floors of the kitchen and the terrace and all the
 stairs coming up the hillside. She will make you a meal tonight.  How
 lucky  you are already in getting lucky Seven. When you go to America
 she will work hard for you.

 The son was an engineer. Hong Kong didn't  need  engineers,  but  the
 land  of  milk and honey made room for everyone. America was the gold
 mountain. All anyone had to do was dig.

 So Yun was not sold but  married.  Her  father-in-law  told  her  new
 husband about opportunities in America, in Arizona. They make Mexican
 food there but not Chinese.  The  family  advised,  Start  a  Chinese
 restaurant.  You will be rich. They sold him on the idea. He invested
 his life savings in a Phoenix fast food place. He brought Yun to work
 it.  They  rebuilt it, sweated over it, worried the prices would ruin
 them. For fifteen more years Number Seven cleaned and cooked. And she
 had  babies, one girl, two girls, three girls, no boys. What bad luck
 for Number Seven, no boys, just cheap little  girls.  She  beat  them
 when  they  wouldn't  work,  when  they wouldn't read their books for
 school, whenever they disobeyed. Cheap little girls. Why couldn't she
 have  baby  boys? She worked harder. After she closed the restaurant,
 and cleaned the floors, and scrubbed the pots and pans,  and  stocked
 the  food and placed it ready for the next day; after she tallied the
 accounts, and ordered all the necessary supplies, Yun sat by  herself
 in  the  cold  night hours. When Arizona slept, when children dreamed
 and husbands gave up, when no one went anywhere, she sewed. She  made
 cloth  hand  puppets  for  children.  Number  Seven got money for the
 puppets, clever donkeys with ears, or parrots with beaks that opened,
 or  bears  with  moving  eyes.  Fifty cents apiece. Lucky Seven could
 work.

 But work wasn't enough. The restaurant failed.  With  borrowed  money
 the  husband  paid  too  much  for a small coffee bar in a California
 suburb, not far from San Francisco. No more Chinese food to cook  for
 customers, just coffee and pastry for business people in the morning,
 frozen yogurt for children after  school,  snacks  for  people  in  a
 hurry.  Just scrub and sell, and sell and scrub. Eight more years. No
 luck without hard work. You must dig if you want to be rich  on  Gold
 Mountain, Number Seven. Hurry up. Lazy girl.

 The  husband's  old girl friend from Hong Kong moved to Gold Mountain
 near San Francisco. His family mentioned her in a  letter.  He  found
 her  phone  number and called her. He went to see her. She was lucky,
 someone with money, someone  pretty,  not  tired  all  the  time.  He
 visited  her  many  times.  He  introduced his daughters to her. They
 loved her, so wonderful, she gave them money, not beatings. They told
 Yun. Daddy's going away with our new mother, you'll see.

 He  tried  to  convince  his  old girl friend they could regain their
 youthful dreams. But she had married someone else. Daddy  was  number
 two.  You  want  to  be number one without money? she complained. How
 much money do you have? I can't marry a poor man. Do you think I'm  a
 fool? I won't leave my husband for you.

 Daddy  took  a gun to his girl friend's house to show her how much he
 loved a pretty girl friend more than an exhausted wife. He threatened
 to  kill  himself if she didn't divorce her husband. No, she said. He
 left. Standing outside her front door he put the gun in his mouth and
 painted  the  exterior  white  woodwork with his brains. Number Seven
 suddenly lived alone in a foreign  world  with  three  daughters  who
 wanted  money  for  school  and fast cars. One by one they moved out.
 They only called her when they  were  broke.  She  sent  checks.  Yun
 worked day and night. Money. She would never make enough.

 The  youngest  daughter  Bernice  asked  to come home when she had no
 other place to live. Mommy, I'm broke, she said. I  couldn't  pay  my
 rent. Please help me.

 Yun couldn't say no. She wanted all her back-breaking efforts to mean
 something. Bernice looked like her dead father,  square-faced,  black
 hair,  solid,  strong.  She  was bright, an answer for every question
 about what happened to all her money. I gave it to friends, she said.
 I fed them. They slept in my living room. My boy friend needed money.
 His car was broken. I paid for repairs.

 Boy friend? Yun asked. What boy friend?

 The man who stays with me, Bernice answered. He has to eat, too.  But
 he can't find a job. He wants to be a baseball player. He's good. You
 should see him play. He's an incredible pitcher. But he  has  a  hard
 time. I help. I gave him money. What could I do? No one wants to give
 a Black man a job. You will meet him. He's coming home with me.

 Bernice and her boy friend moved into Yun's apartment. The boy friend
 sat on the couch and watch TV, or he exercised at a gym. Bernice said
 he pitched for a Triple-A ball club. Sometimes she  worked  in  Yun's
 store. Sometimes she and her lover disappeared for days. Yun wouldn't
 know where they'd  gone.  When  Bernice  came  home  after  her  last
 disappearance,  Yun  stood  in  the center of their apartment's front
 room and yelled, I can't count on you. Why you don't work? I have  to
 do  everything?  I never know when you're here. Why don't he work? He
 don't do nothing.

 Bernice stood facing her mother. We  have  friends,  Mommy,  answered
 Bernice. What should we do? Tell them to drop dead? We took them home
 after a party. They needed a ride. They  live  in  Los  Angeles.  She
 tried  to  smile.  I'll work. I'll help you today. I love you, Mommy.
 Can I have some money?

 He's got to leave, Yun yelled. She pointed at the boy friend. He  sat
 on  the  coach  without  a  word.  He  looked  at  them both standing
 face-to-face in the middle of the room. Without expression  his  eyes
 passed  from  one  to the other. He waited for them to decide. He was
 strong, even sitting down he carried himself straight and  tall,  but
 he  had no job. He hadn't shaved for two days. The new beard made his
 black face darker. Bernice spoke for them both.  He  stays  with  me,
 Mommy.  I'm not going to put him on the street. He's the father of my
 child, Bernice announced.

 What! You going to marry him? Yun exploded.

 No, I don't want to get married. He doesn't make enough,  yet.  We'll
 get  by.  I  want  to have a baby now. Yun stared in fury and bit her
 lower lip. Bernice turned to him and said over her  shoulder,  Mommy,
 you can't tell me what to do, not anymore. I'm a woman now.

 Sitting  at  the  table  in  the hospital, Yun has not moved from her
 chair. She has never talked so much to anyone as she has  in  telling
 her  story.  She  continues  to  work  the fingers of her hands, left
 against right, right against left.


                                - II -

 One year is a long time in fate's hands. Indifferent,  she  can  turn
 her  attention  away  and leave people with the illusion they control
 every aspect of their lives. Angry, she can slide a house into a sink
 hole  or  drop  a bridge on a car. Benevolent, she can invent the one
 gift no one could foresee. She did that and retrieved  Yun  Lee  from
 despair.

 Seymour  Goldman  is  the  first  therapist  Yun  talked to after her
 husband's suicide when muscle spasms tied her in knots and she  could
 no  longer sleep. An acquaintance of Yun's recommended Seymour to her
 as helpful, someone who wouldn't ask for money. He's retired,  nearly
 eighty.  Money  isn't  important  to  him.  He's always hated how the
 pursuit of it distorts people.

 Seymour talked with Yun and referred her to social services  at  Alta
 Bates.  He  saw her occasionally after her release from the hospital.
 She continued to see a psychiatrist there in a group therapy program.
 That doctor prescribed a one year program of a mild anti-depressant.

 "Maybe  it  work,"  Yun told Seymour. "Don't feel so nervous. I'm not
 running around sweating like Rexall girl," by which she means not  as
 fearful as a rickshaw girl.

 Sitting  in  his small living room, Seymour cautiously hopes Yun will
 do well enough. He explains his  view  of  life's  fortunes  and  how
 they've  affected  her.  He  says  the  hardest part of living may be
 overcoming  the  youthful  illusion  that  we  control  our  destiny.
 Certainly  we  should  take  every  advantage  of the best aspects of
 ourselves to find a sense of comfort and fulfillment, he says, though
 people  with the means frequently come face to face with the American
 dilemma, meaninglessness. Seymour faces destiny  more  squarely  than
 most  younger  people.  He mentions he has only a little time left in
 his life. Fate and he sit together.

 He goes on, Our best  efforts  may  only  be  employed  in  the  most
 suitable circumstances. Sometimes we never get such an opportunity.

 He  offers  his  interviewer  coffee  and Almond cookies. He sips and
 rests his cup on the low table in front of him, then spreads his arms
 wide  on the couch where many visitors have often sat and cried their
 troubles. He's a man with something of an old man's  belly,  thinning
 gray  hair  and  a  face  of  blue circles underlining blue eyes. His
 two-bedroom apartment is filled  with  books  on  psychology,  social
 theory,  and art. Some pictures of Asia brighten the walls. These few
 treasures and his car are all he owns. In retirement,  he  has  given
 away  everything  else and lives now in a mixed ethnic, working class
 area just north of Berkeley, California.

 As he talks about fate and its impact on Yun, he sometimes  looks  at
 an  audience  floating in the air on the other side of the room. Many
 of his companions are memories. He smiles as he  remembers  a  Jewish
 anecdote;  If  you  want  to make God laugh, tell him your plans. The
 vagaries of nature make it impossible for us  to  predict  what  will
 happen,  he says. Even with the capabilities and depth of science and
 the force of will, it's a matter of timing. Perhaps we can be certain
 of  some  things.  In  spite  of  that,  we can't know when they will
 happen. Timing is critical because we don't live  forever.  Will  the
 hand  of  luck  intervene  in  our lifetime? It seems a miracle if it
 does.

 He tells what has happened to Yun.

 When she visits, as  she  sometimes  does,  she  is  playful,  almost
 girlish.  If Seymour teases her about continuing to work too hard she
 will walk straight up to him and pantomime passing her  hand  up  and
 down in front of his face, forefinger and thumb together. "I sew your
 mouth," she yells at him, grinning. Now she wants to work.  She  will
 tolerate  no  protests  from Seymour. She knows best. In spite of the
 fact that she labors eighteen hours a day and is in her  mid-fifties,
 she  barrels  through  each  day  as vigorously as she once slaved in
 Arizona.

 Often she will work late at her store. After nine at night, after she
 closes,  she  disassembles all the Yogurt making equipment, pulls out
 refrigerator trays, and opens the espresso machine.  She  cleans  all
 the  metal  parts  and  filters  and  so  forth. Then she reassembles
 everythingùloads the yogurt machines with starters, flavoring,  sugar
 and  waterùcharges  the  steam  reservoirs  in the coffee makers with
 filtered  water.  She  cleans  and  reinserts  all  the  refrigerator
 shelves.  After  that she scrubs the entire store, shelves, counters,
 tables and floor, to be sure no smell of rancid milk or  coffee  ruin
 the  air.  Only when the store is spotless and ready for the next day
 does she empty the register and tally the accounts. She  records  the
 days expenses and income and often brings her ledgers home to combine
 them with accounting of small investments she makes. She's building a
 fund.  With  some  advice  from  a  Schwab  broker  she's has already
 invested enough of her savings and a small insurance settlement  from
 her  dead  husband's  policy to stop working, if she lives carefully.
 But she doesn't stop. She has something in mind.

 Her youngest daughter Bernice helps in the store nearly all the  time
 now.  Yun  sacrifices  to make sure Bernice is paid enough so she can
 afford the rent on a small apartment where she lives with her  baby's
 father.  Often  she  brings  the  baby  to  the  store. The father is
 handsome and the child has inherited his dark, good looks.  Yun  will
 stop  what  she's  doing  and  sit  with  the  baby,  showing  off to
 customers. Regulars look for her sitting at a  table  in  her  coffee
 shop,  a newborn in her lap or parked on her shoulder staring out the
 window at sidewalk traffic. The baby is remarkable, yes? The baby  is
 bright,  watches  everything.  What  a beautiful baby, certainly. Six
 months after giving birth Bernice entered  the  baby  in  a  modeling
 contest  and  won.  The  baby makes money posing for pictures selling
 infant clothing.

 Yun teaches her daughter. Bernice is learning how to clean and repair
 the  machines  in the store. She calls frequent customers by name and
 knows their favorite tastes. When she doesn't come to  work,  a  rare
 failure  these  days, or when she makes mistakes with money, or dares
 to day-dream about a second child, Yun doesn't yell.  She  holds  her
 temper. Things work out. No worry. The baby is a boy.

 Stavo sdraiato nella vasca da bagno e mi divertivo  a  fare  scoregge
 nell'acqua.   Mi  piacciono  le  bollicine  e  non  ho  i  soldi  per
 l'idromassaggio cosi' mi arrangio. L'acqua era sporca. Era un bel po'
 che non mi facevo un bagno e poi mi ero appena masturbato e lo sperma
 galleggiava in grumi densi e biancastri intorno a me rendendo l'acqua
 ancor  meno  limpida.  Mi  piace  sborrare  nell'acqua. Le piu' belle
 scopate,  forse  anche  perche'  richiedono   un   impegno   ed   una
 concentrazione  maggiore,  le  ho  sempre  fatte nell'acqua. Tutte le
 volte,  dopo  essere  venuto,  fisso  quell'ammasso   gelatinoso   di
 potenziali   esseri   umani   sperando   di  vedere  qualche  singolo
 spermatozoo, che so un po' piu' grande degli altri tanto da  rendersi
 visibile, con la sua testolina, la sua bella coda, insomma come ce li
 hanno descritti a scuola. Sempre invano. A volte mi e' persino venuta
 la  tentazione  di prendere un microscopio per tentare di vederli, ma
 fortunatamente spesso ho di meglio da fare che stronzate del genere.

 Squilla il telefono, io bestemmio. Sempre mentre faccio il bagno.  Il
 telefono,  non  le bestemmie. E si' che non suona molte volte in casa
 mia. Resto un attimo indeciso se andare o lasciar perdere.  E  se  e'
 qualche  figa  a  cui  ho  lasciato il mio numero nel caso le venisse
 voglia? Lo lascio a tutte. C'e' comunque una probabilita'  su  cento.
 E' sufficiente. Mi alzo gocciolante e mi dirigo verso il telefono che
 non desiste. Mi gratto il culo con la salvietta e rispondo.

 "Pronto, chi mi cerca?" "Ciao Alan, sono Marco. Ti disturbo?"

 "Beh direi proprio di si'". E' andata male anche stavolta, penso. "Mi
 spiace,  ma volevo solamente chiederti scusa" continua lui. "Va bene,
 e di cosa?" "Si', insomma... ti ricordi l'ultima volta che  ci  siamo
 visti,  sara' stato sei o sette mesi fa. Tu mi avevi detto che la mia
 ragazza era una gran puttana ed io beh... ti diedi  uno  schiaffo  in
 faccia  di  fronte  a  tutti"  "Ah gia', mi ricordo... ma era un gran
 cartone sui denti se non sbaglio. Finii lungo  disteso  in  mezzo  al
 bar... una bella vista, pero'"

 "Ci  siamo  lasciati  la  settimana  scorsa"  continua  Marco  "avevo
 scoperto che la dava veramente ad un sacco di persone e tu che allora
 stavi cercando di farmi aprire gli  occhi..."  "Ma  no  Marco,  erano
 tutte  balle  le  mie.  Ero  sbronzo  ed  ero incazzato perche' avevo
 tentato di farmela e non c'era stata, tutto qui"

 "Ti ringrazio, sei un amico, ma  non  hai  bisogno  di  mentirmi  per
 tirarmi su il morale, non ce n'e' bisogno. Oramai e' tutto finito tra
 noi". Lascio che mi creda un  amico,  e'  gia'  abbastanza  giu'  per
 contraddirlo.  "Gran  troia  pero'  quella  Lisa,  eh?" gli dico. "Si
 chiama Anna. Lisa e' la  ragazza  di  Alfredo"  "Ah  gia',  e'  vero"
 rammento.  Forse,  allora,  era quella che avevo tentato d'infilzare.
 Boh, chi se ne ricorda piu'. Non si puo' tenere  il  conto  di  tutto
 nella  vita.  "Beh,  ora  ti  saluto  Alan,  scusami  ancora se ti ho
 disturbato"

 "Di niente Marco, ci si vede" e riattacco. Torno in bagno, ma l'acqua
 si  e' raffreddata ed e' inutile rientrare nella vasca. Apro il tappo
 ed osservo scorrere via l'acqua con lo sporco, che disegna due  righe
 di  necrologio  sulle  pareti laterali, e tutto il resto. Che spreco,
 penso.

 Mi spruzzo un po' di borotalco sotto le ascelle e sulle balle, poi mi
 asciugo  velocemente  i capelli. Vado in sala e metto su Rain Dogs di
 Tom Waits. Poi vado in  cucina  a  prendermi  una  lattina  di  birra
 ghiacciata.  Quando ascolto Tom Waits mi viene sempre voglia di bere,
 non so perche', anche se, a dire il vero, la cosa mi accade anche con
 molti  altri:  Nick  Cave,  i  Pogues, i Beasts of Bourbon, i Monster
 Magnet, i Redrum, Vinicio Capossela,  gli  Action  Swingers,  Stefano
 Benni, Andrea Pazienza, Paolo Rossi... non sono tutti cantanti, fa lo
 stesso. La tapparella della cucina si e' incastrata a mezza altezza e
 non va ne' su ne' giu'. Forse dovrei smontarla e guardarci dentro, si
 dev'essere annodata la corda. Non  sono  bravo  nei  lavori  manuali,
 cosi'  la  lascio  com'e'.  Non mi piace nemmeno avere troppa luce in
 casa.

 Squilla di nuovo  il  telefono.  Due  volte  in  meno  di  un'ora  e'
 sicuramente una rarita' in casa mia. Vado tranquillo e contento. Sono
 desiderato oggi, mi dico con stupore.

 "Pronto..." "Alan ciao,  sono  Marina...  Marina  Dodi,  ti  ricordi?
 Eravamo  in  classe  insieme  al  liceo.  Senti,  io  e qualche altro
 pensavamo di fare una cena di nuovo tutti  insieme,  o  comunque  chi
 vuole  venire,  tanto  per  chiacchierare  un po' e vedere come siamo
 messi dopo tanti anni. Cosa dici, vieni?"

 La sua voce e' squillante e fastidiosa, ma se me  la  ricordavo  bene
 non  era  una  brutta  figa. Dovevo anche averci messo la mano tra le
 tette una volta durante una gita, e lei mi aveva tirato uno  sberlone
 che  mi  aveva  rintronato  per due ore. In seguito non mi aveva piu'
 rivolto la parola ed  io,  comunque,  non  mi  suicidai  per  questo.
 Probabilmente  l'avevano  costretta  a  telefonarmi, non credo avesse
 chiesto lei di farlo.

 "Senti" gli dico con voce suadente "in questo momento sono nudo e  mi
 sto  toccando  l'uccello,  perche' non fai un salto a casa mia che ne
 parliamo  meglio?".  "Sei  sempre  il  solito  maiale"  mi  dice  lei
 riattaccando.  Non  ha  mai  avuto il senso dell'umorismo, non potevo
 sperare di piu'.

 Vado in camera a vestirmi. Perche'? Non so, forse mi viene voglia  di
 uscire.  Non  credo, ma in ogni caso sarei pronto. Torno a sedermi in
 sala meditando sullo scarso  valore  della  mia  esistenza.  Chi  sta
 morendo,  chi  viene  torturato,  chi  vende  aspirapolveri  o chi e'
 innamorato senza speranze in fondo sta peggio di me,  penso.  Non  e'
 molto, ma mi so accontentare.

 Di nuovo un suono. Stavolta e' la porta, non il telefono.  Meno  male
 cosi'  vedo  qualcuno.  Apro.  Una ragazza abbastanza giovane con due
 occhioni spalancati da battitrice di tesi sta in piedi davanti a me e
 cerca di convincermi a comprare un opuscolo in cui c'e' scritto della
 mancanza di valori e dell'immoralita'  della  gioventu'  moderna  che
 pensa  solamente  a ballare, ascoltare musica rock e pomiciare. Pensa
 un po' te.  Mi  tiro  giu'  la  patta  e  le  mostro  il  cazzo.  Lei
 indietreggia un attimo tra lo sbigottito e il sorpreso.

 "E' esageratamente grosso rispetto all'altezza" esclama.  Non  so  se
 ritenerlo  un  complimento  alla  mia  virilita'  o  un'offesa per la
 statura. "Perche' non entri che  ti  faccio  vedere  come  s'ingrossa
 ulteriormente"  mi limito a dirle con la speranza di ravvivare quello
 spento pomeriggio di un'estate come tante altre in un'annoiata citta'
 deserta  e  intorpidita  dal sole che s'infrange sui muri bianchi dei
 palazzi e tutte quelle cazzate li'.

 "Ma vaffanculo" mi dice lei andandosene via. "Peggio per te" le  urlo
 mentre  scende  le  scale.  E  peggio  anche  per me, penso chiudendo
 malinconicamente la porta. Due miliardi e mezzo di donne sul  pianeta
 e  nessuna  disponibile  per me. Ma cosa cazzo fanno tutto il giorno?
 Fanno jogging,  aerobica,  stretching,  training  autogeno,  visitano
 musei,  castelli,  chiese,  scrivono  poesie  e  lettere ai giornali,
 aiutano invalidi e bambini poveri,  partecipano  a  conferenze  sugli
 indiani  o  l'Amazzonia. Scopare? Quasi niente. Pensa te in che mondo
 ci tocca vivere.

 Squilla di nuovo il telefono. Una, due, tre  volte.  Non  la  finisce
 mai.  Corro  di  la', strappo la spina e getto tutto dall'altra parte
 della stanza. Me ne torno a letto a dormire, forse e' meglio cosi'.

 The Oldsmobile smashed through the window of Huey's  Bar  And  Grill.
 The  bar sat on the edge of a dangerous intersection, and the traffic
 coming off Winchester Pike  and  heading  for  the  freeway,  quickly
 picked up speed as they headed for the light.

 Tonight,  a  Mustang Cobra loaded with high school kids out for a joy
 ride, had run the red light at Refugee causing the Olds to swerve out
 of control and right through the front wall of Huey's.

 Douglas  Concord  watched in bemused silence as the Cutlass came to a
 stop not two feet from him, and right on top of his now former lover,
 Denise.

 He  detached  himself  from his chair and got on his knees. He looked
 under the vehicle and stood. He walked to the driver's side door  and
 calmly opened it, lifting a dazed looking businessman from the seat.

 "Hey,  Doug," the bartender, Jake, yelled at him, "Is Denise gonna be
 all right? Should I call 911?"

 "Naw, Jake. She's got a sliver of glass in her  throat  the  size  of
 one'a your lead burgers. Ambulance won't do her any good now."

 The patrons of the bar watched as Doug sat the now wild eyed business
 man down on the nearest undamaged table. They fully expected  to  see
 some horrific violence here tonight.

 Doug held out his hand to the businessman, "Mister, you just saved me
 a whole lotta fuckin' trouble and I wanna  shake  your  hand.  What's
 your name?"

 Hysteria  was  replaced by caution on the man's face. "Paul Brubaker.
 How did I save you..."

 "Douglas."

 "How'd I save you, Douglas?"

 "Well, I'll tell you. I been fuckin' the woman pinned underneath your
 car  for  about  a  year  now.  The wife's been gettin' a little edgy
 lately. I think she knows. I was here tonight to tell Denise  that  I
 couldn't  see  her  anymore. Well, when I told her, you know what she
 did?"

 Paul's face had paled a little, "No. What'd she do?"

 "She threatened me. Me, Douglas Concord. Said she was gonna  tell  my
 wife  the  whole  story. Said she might even grab one of my kid's and
 hold'em for sexual ransom. Now, I wasn't too worried about the  kids,
 they'll  need  to  learn about sex eventually, and, boy, was Denise a
 load in bed?..." He turned toward the bar, "Hey, Jake,  fix  our  man
 Paul a brew would'ya?"

 The sound of sirens could be heard in the distance. Knowing rush hour
 traffic, they wouldn't make it to Huey's for at least another six  to
 seven  minutes.  Most  of the customers had, by now, disappeared, not
 wanting to become involved as witnesses.

 Jake brought the beer to the table and walked through the front  wall
 to inspect the damage. Douglas continued his story.

 "Well,  anyway,  I wasn't too worried about the kids, but my wife. My
 wife is a different story. She's the only thing in this world that  I
 am  truly  afraid  of.  Last year, when things with Denise were hot &
 heavy, I tried to kill Sharon. Came home from  work  with  my  newest
 toy.  A  genuine  switchblade knife. Walked right up behind the bitch
 while she was cooking dinner and run it ever  so  gently  across  her
 throat.  She  turns  around with two big smiles, her blood runnin' in
 fuckin' rivers all over  my  dinner,  and  she  laughs  at  me.  Just
 standin' there. Laughin' like a crazy fool..."

 "Mister...."

 "Shut the fuck up. Let me finish. Do you know what happened next?"

 "Mister, look..."

 "I said... shut the fuck up, or I'm going to put a dent in your thick
 skull. Do you know what happened next? Her  throat  closed  up.  Just
 closed  up.  Yeah,  sure,  it  left  an ugly as hell scar running the
 length of her neck, but that fucker  healed  faster  than  the  blood
 could run outta her."

 Paul now looked like a wet sheet, "You said her name was Sharon?..."

 Douglas  opened  his  fist and planted it on Paul's forehead, forcing
 his head into the hard surface of the table twice, "Goddammnit, Paul,
 shut  the  fuck  up, or I swear to God I'll pull out that switchblade
 and see if you can heal yourself as fast!"

 Paul reluctantly acquiesced.

 "She looked me in the eye and said two words. You know what those two
 words were, you stupid fuck?"

 Paul kept his mouth shut.

 "She  said...  Paul  Brubaker. And she turned around to the stove and
 served me up a fresh helping of Spaghetti & blood."

 Paul Brubaker tried to get up and run, but Douglas was too quick.  He
 grabbed the back of Paul's neck and threw him to the ground.

 Douglas could hear the ambulance screech into the parking lot, and he
 looked through the hole in the wall to see a  police  car  coming  in
 quickly  behind.  He  turned the struggling businessman over with the
 greatest of efforts and rammed the palm of  his  left  hand  down  on
 Paul's nose. The struggling ceased as Paul joined Denise.

                                 *****

 Douglas slipped out the back door moments before the first CPD patrol
 officer stepped into Huey's bar and grill.
     
                                 *****

 Sharon  Concord  sat in the swing on the front porch, waiting for her
 husband. The Cobra pulled into the  driveway  and  two  greasy,  acne
 marked, teenagers emerged and walked toward the house.

 They knelt before the swing and bowed.

 The  oldest  of  the two looked up in admiration, "We've finished the
 task you set before us, master."

 "Excellent. Now go to your room, and wait for your master to send you
 your reward."

 The  two  youngsters  disappeared through the front door of the house
 just as Douglas came sauntering up the street.

 He approached the swing. "Hey, babe. You won't have  to  worry  about
 Paul Brubaker any more. His nose is touching the back of his skull."

 "Wonderful. The children are waiting for you in their room..."

 Ottobre. C'e' un senso di quiete ed inevitabile decadenza in ottobre,
 di cose che finiscono, di tempo che volge al suo scadere. Ottobre non
 ha una fisionomia propria, e'  un  passaggio,  un  lungo  momento  di
 transito.  A  settembre  ci  si  sposa,  a  settembre si vendemmia, a
 settembre il cielo e' azzurro e terso, al mattino  fa  freddo  ma  le
 giornate sono ancora tiepide e piacevoli. In novembre cala la nebbia,
 il  freddo  si  fa  piu'  intenso,  si  pensa  gia'   alla   stagione
 dell'inverno  e si incomincia ad assaporare il calore psicologico che
 scaccia il freddo esteriore. Vendono le caldarroste per  la  via,  la
 gente  si  imbacucca  nei  cappotti,  le  giornate  sono corte, ma al
 tramonto le vie si illuminano.

 A ottobre niente di tutto questo. E' troppo di mezzo, non  fa  ancora
 freddo,  ma  non fa piu' caldo, le giornate si accorciano, ma le sere
 non si allungano, il cielo non e' piu' azzurro, ma non ancora grigio,
 resta  di un indefinito colore giallo e sembra che aspetti. A ottobre
 sembra che tutta la natura  alzi  la  testa  dalle  sue  faccende  ed
 aspetti.  Aspetti  cosa?  Non  lo so. Ottobre e' misterioso nella sua
 attesa, ognuno in questo mese aspetta una cosa segreta  e  personale,
 con letizia o con trepidazione ottobre aspetta.

 Ora  mentre  guido  sto  pensando  mio malgrado. E' sera, il cielo e'
 striato di rosso e di nero, vedo scintillare per qualche  momento  il
 sole  sulla  carlinga di un aereo, in alto sopra di me. Sono ferma ad
 un semaforo, aspetto che venga  il  verde  (aspetto)  e  parto.  Sono
 andata in ufficio lo stesso oggi pomeriggio. Meglio cosi', in ufficio
 non devo parlare con nessuno e tengo la mente occupato. Ora pero sono
 fuori.  Quella cosa malefica e' li' sul sedile di fianco a me, il mio
 nome stampato sopra in nero, Teresa M. (ho sempre pensato di cambiare
 quel  nome,  disconoscere  mio padre come lui ha fatto con me) il suo
 cupo contentuo nascosto dietro l'innocua facciata di una  cartelletta
 rosa.  Vorrei  poter andare a luglio, avrei piu' tempo, tempo per non
 pensare, e' ottobre, sto aspettando, sto aspettando di...

 Verra'. L'infermiera si avvicina, vuole spostare la mia  sedia  dalla
 finestra,  ma  io  non  voglio.  Verra'  e  mi  alzero'  per andargli
 incontro. Forse dovrei farmi bella, pero' non  so  dove  ho  messo  i
 trucchi  e sono troppo stanca per andarli a cercare. Dopotutto lui mi
 ha sempre detto che sono un fiore, non ho  bisogno  di  ornamentarmi.
 "Non ti servono questi," mi diceva, togliendomi di mano il rossetto e
 il fard. "Sei un fiore."

 "Adesso andiamo a mangiare Signora M."  L'infermiera  prende  la  mia
 carrozzella  e  mi avvia verso la sala da pranzo. Non capisce che non
 posso staccarmi dalla finestra. Finche ero nella nostra  casa  potevo
 restare  dentro  ad  aspettare,  lui sapeva dove trovarmi e poi c'era
 sempre Rita che giocava fuori, lei lo  avrebbe  visto  e  lo  avrebbe
 chiamato nel caso non si fosse accorto di noi. Teresa era gia' andata
 via o era ancora li? Non  mi  ricordo,  perche'  e'  cosi'  difficile
 ricordare  le  cose?  Qui  nessuno  gioca  fuori, anche perche' e' un
 gelido gennaio e cumuli di neve ghiacciata ricoprono il marciapiede e
 l'aiuola di la della strada.

 Non voglio allontanarmi dalla finestra. Cerco di alzare la mano ma e'
 uno sforzo troppo grande. Cerco di  spiegare,  allora,  perche'  devo
 restare  la', devo tenere d'occhio la strada, lui potrebbe passare di
 li' e lo perderei.  Devo  dirlo  all'infermiera,  ma  le  parole  non
 vengono,  sorgono  invece  lacrime  che non riesco a fermare. "Suvvia
 Signora M. non faccia cosi'." mi consola l'infermiera, ma il suo tono
 e'  sbrigativo,  i suoi occhi guardano altrove. "Sono stanca," riesco
 finalmente a dire. Cosa ne sa questa infermiera superefficiente della
 stanchezza  che  mi  schiaccia,  questo  immenso  peso  sul  corpo  e
 sull'anima che a malapena mi lascia respirare?

 Aspettarlo ogni notte e ogni giorno, cercare nel contempo di allevare
 due  figlie  che  non volevano piu' saperne di lui. "E' un vigliacco,
 mamma," gridava Teresa "Non tornera'!" Bugiarda. Nemmeno Rita capiva.
 Lei  non  insisteva per togliermi dalla finestra, faceva di tutto per
 non distrarmi, ma aspettava con paziente ansia che  io  smettessi  di
 aspettare.  La sua pazienza mi ha logorato non meno dell'insofferenza
 di Teresa, come sua sorella anche lei ha colpa per aver  fiaccato  la
 mia  volonta'.  Ho  dovuto  rinunciare  a  loro  per  aspettare  lui,
 capiranno un giorno che ero troppo stanca per fare diversamente.

 L'infermiera non vuole capire che devo aspettare, non  posso  perdere
 di vista la strada. Se lui viene e io non ci sono, andra' oltre e non
 mi trovera' mai piu'. Forse sta passando in questo momento e  io  non
 sono  la, non lo vedro', non potro' chiamarlo a me. Penso al suo nome
 e penso a quando lo diro', e mi alzero' e gli andro' incontro  e  lui
 mi  abbraccera'  e  mi  dira'  "Sei  un  fiore."  Come a luglio. Devo
 aspettare...

 Mi sdraio sul letto e cerco di pensare ad  altro.  E'  difficile  con
 tutto  il  chiasso che stanno facendo in corridoio, con i bambini che
 schiamazzano e la suora che cerca di richiamarli  all'ordine.  Se  ho
 fortuna  non  si  accorgeranno  che  non  sono con gli altri e potro'
 restare qui da sola. Mi tiro su e guardo  fuori  dalla  finestra.  E'
 aprile  ma  non  c'e' niente fuori che me lo dica. Solo uno squallido
 cortile in cemento circondato da uno squallido muro in cemento  e  un
 cielo che e' grigio non di nuvole ma di smog.

 Andro'  mai  via  da qui? La suora sorride con compassione. "Sei gia'
 grande, Rita, e' difficile che ti portino via, lo so che  non  e'  un
 bel  posto, abbiamo tentato tante volte di farci trasferire, vorremmo
 una casa con un bel giardino attorno, ma vedrai che le cose  andranno
 meglio, basta solo aver un po' di pazienza, e confidare in Dio."

 Allora  aspetto.  Non  e' giusto che mi abbiano lasciata qui da sola.
 Potevano aver cura di me. Mamma era stanca, ma poteva alzarsi, doveva
 alzarsi.  Potevo  fare  tante  cose da sola, sapevo fare da mangiare,
 sapevo pulire la casa. Doveva  solo  alzarsi  quando  vennero  quegli
 uomini  e saremmo ancora li'. Ma lei non si alzo'. Si dondolava sulla
 sedia e guardava fissa davanti e non rispondeva alle loro domande.  E
 quando  se  ne  andarono  i suoi occhi si riempirono di lacrime e lei
 disse, "sono stanca."

 Gli uomini tornarono e la portarono via, ed una  donna  che  era  con
 loro  mi  porto'  qui.  Cercarono Teresa, ma non la trovarono, era da
 tanto che se n'era andata. "Diventero' come la mamma se  resto  qui,"
 mi  disse.  E  scappo'  anche  lei,  e  mi  lascio'. Non so se glielo
 perdonero'. Io ero piccola, sono ancora piccola  anche  se  la  suora
 dice di no. Non dovrei essere qui, dovrei essere in luglio. Invece mi
 ricorico e aspetto che...


 Morire.  Non  ho  ancora vissuto e devo gia' morire. Ora sono a casa,
 continuo a pensare. La telefonata di questa  mattina,  "Signorina  M.
 abbiamo i risultati dei suoi esami, potrebbe passare verso le tre per
 favore?" Mi ha dato la cartella e mi ha spiegato, le parole affiorano
 ora, sulle prime in maniera disordinata, poi con crescente precisione
 ...linfomatosi...   doveva   rivolgersi   a   noi   prima...metastasi
 estese...un    anno,   forse   meno...deve   essere   forte...terapia
 ma...guardare in faccia la realta'.

 Mi hanno chiesto se avevo parenti. Ho negato. So che la  mamma  fini'
 in  un  manicomio e Rita in un orfanotrofio. Le ho abbandonate quando
 avevano bisogno di me, non andro' a cercarle ora perche'  ho  bisogno
 io  di  loro.  Anche  perche'  non mi possono aiutare in nessun modo.
 Nessuno puo' piu'. Mi hanno parlato si' di terapie d'urto, ma  me  le
 hanno  sconsigliate.  "Le possibilita' di sconfiggere il suo cancro a
 questo punto sono tanto esigue da essere praticamente nulle.  Il  mio
 consiglio  Signorina,  e' di vivere la sua vita al pieno finche ne ha
 le forze. Quest'ospedale non crede nell'accanimento terapeutico,  noi
 cerchiamo,  specialmente  in  questi  casi,  di  migliorare  la vita,
 piuttosto che prolungare la morte.

 Non mi fraintenda, non le sto dicendo che ci laviamo le mani di  lei,
 tutt'altro.  Lei e' libera, anzi, ha il dovere di consultare un altro
 specialista. Sono convinto pero' che le dira' cio' che le sto dicendo
 io.  Che  il suo tumore e' troppo esteso e troppo avanzato per potere
 essere curato, che gli effetti  collaterali  legati  ad  una  terapia
 d'urto  non farebbero che rendere il suo tempo rimanente piu' triste.
 Se fossi al suo posto, Signorina mi godrei con la  massima  serenita'
 possibile  il  tempo  che  mi  resta. Quest'ospedale sta seguendo con
 molto interesse i recenti progressi fatti nella terapia del dolore, e
 credo  che  lei  potra'  restare fisicamente abile, e priva di dolore
 fino quasi all'ultimo. So quanto puo' essere tremendo per una ragazza
 della sua eta' sentirsi dire questa cose, ma questa e' la realta' dei
 fatti. Il meglio in cui puo' sperare e' di morire senza male nel  suo
 letto  a  casa,  circondata dalle persone che ama." A questo punto il
 medico mi aveva chiesto della mia famiglia. "Lei dunque e' sola.  Non
 si  stacchi da gli amici, allora, non si vergogni di cercare sostegno
 ovunque puo'. E non si preoccupi, da noi potra' trovare  anche  degli
 psicologi  specializzati  che  le  aiuteranno ad affrontare al meglio
 questa terribile situazione. "

 Forse faro' tutte queste cose sagge, ed equilibrate, e rassegnate.  O
 forse  mi  buttero'  sul  letto  e  restero' qui ad aspettare. Non so
 ancora. Mi siedo. In cucina attorno a me il silenzio. Mi sento  tanto
 stanca,  improvvisamente stanca, ogni mia energia mi ha lasciato, non
 serve piu' a nulla che io mi  affanni.  Forse  si  senti'  cosi'  mia
 madre.  L'ho lasciata poco dopo che mio padre scappo' perche' lei era
 caduta in uno stato depressivo profondo, e nulla la smuoveva piu'. Si
 sedeva  sulla  sedia  a dondolo e si dondolava, mattina, pomeriggio e
 sera. Io tornavo dal lavoro, Rita tornava da  scuola  e  lei  diceva,
 "andate  a prendere qualcosa da mangiare ragazze." Alzava la mano per
 indicare la porta, ma non indicava niente, alzava la mano  e  poi  la
 lasciava  cadere.  E  Rita  diceva "Vieni con noi mamma, dai," ma lei
 scuoteva la testa e diceva, "sono stanca."

 Quanto tempo e' durata questa  situazione?  Mesi,  prima  che  me  ne
 andai.  E  qualche mese ancora dopo. Mia madre aveva una pensione per
 fortuna. Ma alla banca si insospettirono quando io smisi  di  andarci
 per  il  ritiro  mensile e prese ad andarci Rita. Devono essere stati
 loro ad avvertire l'assistenza sociale. Quando l'ho saputo  ho  fatto
 perdere  le mie tracce molto in fretta. Un nuovo inizio, da sola. Non
 potevo essere utile a loro, ne loro a me. Via dalle tristezze, via da
 mia  madre  a  cui  non  importavo piu', via da Rita, responsabilita'
 gravosa, responsabilita' non mia.

 L'unica cosa che rimpiango e' l'estate,  il  mese  di  luglio  quando
 c'era  tempo per tutto. Le lunghe lunghe giornate, le fresche nuotate
 nel fiume, le passeggiate sotto i portici la sera, io e le mie amiche
 nei nostri vestitini corti a farci guardare dai ragazzi. L'estate dei
 miei diciotto anni, il mio compleanno in riva al fiume con le angurie
 a  mollo  tra  i  sassi. Quando hai diciotto anni ti sembra di essere
 immortale, tutto puo' cambiare e cambiera' solo in meglio.  A  luglio
 non pensi che a vivere, ogni sapore, ogni colore, ogni rumore e odore
 e' intenso ed inebriante, ogni atomo di tempo e' infinito in  potenza
 ed in essenza.

 In agosto mio padre scappo', e tutto fini'.

 L'ora  del  pranzo  e'  sempre  troppo  lungo, non possono immaginare
 quanto smanio per tornare alla  finestra.  Sta  passando  di  li'  il
 dottore,  mi  sorride  e  chiede  "Come  andiamo  oggi,  Signora  M?"
 L'infermiera sbuffa e dice, "Non  cambia  mai,  non  vuole  mangiare,
 piange  con  ogni  cucchiaiata e cerca di guardare fuori." Il dottore
 scuote la testa. Oggi l'infermiera e' di cattivo umore, e si lamenta.
 Sono  cose  che  ha  gia'  detto  molte volte, e parla come se io non
 potessi sentirla. "Non capisco, va bene che il marito l'ha  lasciata,
 ma ridursi cosi'... Lei ha visto la figlia, la piccola... insomma non
 ha il minimo senso di responsabilita'? Almeno per amore delle  figlie
 doveva reagire!"

 Lo so che dovevo, mi fa male pensarci, e io ci penso alle mie figlie.
 Non avrei voluto, ma ero  troppo  stanca,  davvero  non  potevo  piu'
 occuparmi  di  loro. Il dottore sta parlando, e anche lui ripete cose
 che ho gia'  sentito.  "Il  marito  l'ha  lasciata  che  lei  era  in
 esaurimento  nervoso gia' da mesi. Era gia' fragile e si e' spezzata.
 Abbiamo tutti un punto di rottura, alcuni sono solo piu'  vulnerabili
 di altri. Non disprezzi mai la debolezza altrui Signorina."

 E'  vero che sono debole. Non e' colpa mia. Penso al caldo luglio, mi
 chiamava fiore e mi portava fiori. Non era mai stato  cosi'  dolce  e
 tenero  quanto  in  quel  meraviglioso  mese. Teresa compiva diciotto
 anni, Rita ne aveva da poco compiuti undici. Uscivamo  insieme  tutta
 la  famiglia  alla  domenica  a  mangiare  il  gelato.  Rita  ne  era
 entusiasta, Teresa un po' meno, diceva di essere  troppo  grande  per
 andare  in giro con mamma e papa'. E le coccole, mi regalo' un anello
 come se fossimo di nuovo  fidanzati.  Lui  faceva  tutto  questo  per
 guarirmi.  Come  faccio a credere che all'improvviso se ne sia potuto
 andare? Senza una parola, senza una spiegazione? Per forza  tornera',
 come  potrebbe  essere altrimenti? Teresa insiste che aveva un'altra,
 l'aveva  sentito  dire  in  paese,   ma   erano   calunnie,   dettate
 dall'invidia.

 Percio' devo aspettare. Percio' so che verra'.

 "Vengono  a vederti!" La voce della suora e' trionfante, mi abbraccia
 d'impulso e sorride. "Oggi pomeriggio stesso.  Volevano  una  bambina
 piccola  dicevano,  ma  la  Madre  li  ha  convinti a considerare una
 ragazzina un po' piu' grande. "E allora mi  vogliono?"  Sta  entrando
 anche la Madre Superiore, e scuote la testa. "Non siamo precipitosi,"
 disse. "Rita queste due persone non hanno ancora nemmeno iniziato  le
 procedure  formali  per poter ottenere un figlio in adozione, per ora
 stanno solo considerando  l'idea  e  cercando  una  bambina  con  cui
 pensano  di  poter  andare d'accordo. Non sono giovani, per questo ho
 suggerito loro che adottando un  bambino  piu'  grande  si  sarebbero
 trovati  meglio e avrebbero trovato meno ostacoli burocratici. Ma non
 ti hanno ancora scelta, bambina, e questo non e' l'unico istituto che
 visiteranno."

 Resto spaesata. Esultare? Non posso. Ho paura adesso, e penso che non
 voglio vederli, non voglio vederli se poi mi diranno di  no.  "Quando
 uno  ha un bambino suo non lo puo' scegliere," protesto. "Perche' non
 possono prendermi senza avermi  visto?  Se  devo  essere  un  figlia,
 perche' non posso essere una sorpresa come i figli veri?"

 La  superiora scuote la testa. "Tu sarai sempre figlia di tua madre e
 tuo padre," mi spiega. E' una donna  gentile,  ha  molti  bambini  da
 curare  ma  ci  conosce  uno per uno e ci vuole bene. Ho letto Oliver
 Twist, quando mi hanno portato via da mia madre temevo di finire come
 lui. Ho fatto incubi terribili per mesi, anche quando ho scoperto che
 la  realta'  era  diversa.  "Le  persone  che  ti   adotteranno   non
 prenderanno  mai  il  posto  dei tuoi veri genitori, perche tu li hai
 conosciuti e hai vissuto con loro per molti  anni.  E  allora  devono
 essere  disposti ad accettare tutto quello che dai tuoi veri genitori
 tu hai preso ed appreso. Non e' una cosa facile entrare in una  nuova
 famiglia  alla  tua  eta',  e non e' una cosa facile per due genitori
 pensare che loro figlia e' anche figlia di altri."

 Capisco. Ma questo  non  rendera'  piu'  facile  la  mia  attesa.  La
 Superiora  esce,  la  suorina  dietro  di  lei.  Penso,  non  a  oggi
 pomeriggio. Scappo verso luglio, il  caldo,  caldo  mese  di  luglio.
 Corro  a  perdifiato  nei  campi di grano, corro e corro, il cuore mi
 batte nel petto, nella gola, nelle orecchie. Quando ero piu' piccola,
 (ma  sono ancora piccola) i campi di grano mi sembravano infiniti. Si
 stendevano attorno a me fino all'orizzonte, fino  al  limite  estremo
 del  mondo,  e correvo a piu' non posso per attraversarli. Se correvo
 abbastanza forte  sarei  arrivata  all'orlo  del  mondo  e  mi  sarei
 lanciata al di la. E allora avrei avuto solo un istante per esclamare
 di stupore alla vista dello spazio stellare e lo  stesso  sospiro  di
 meraviglia  mi  si  sarebbe  congelato  sulle labbra, il sudore mi si
 sarebbe congelato sulla  fronte  e  sarei  diventata  per  sempre  un
 piccolo e sbalordito ufo vagante per il cielo.

 Corro  e  corro,  ma  la  forza di gravita' mi trattiene, il campo di
 grano finisce in un canale di scolo.

 E' ora e' luglio, e sono alla fine davvero.  Sono  contenta  di  aver
 vissuto un altro compleanno, sono andata a mangiare l'anguria in riva
 al fiume con il mio gruppo di terapia dell'ospedale. Poi  sono  stata
 male  e  mi hanno portato qui. Penso a mia madre e a Rita, sono stata
 egoista, ma non  posso  dispiacermene.  Sono  belle  anche  le  notti
 d'estate,  i  grandi  cieli  stellati,  le  costellazioni che ruotano
 maestose nel firmamento. Andro' li' e forse tutto sara' perdonato.

 Ed e' luglio, mi sento fremere. Anche  l'infermiera  se  ne  accorge,
 tocca il braccio del dottore e commenta, "Guarda, sorride." Certo che
 sorrido. Sento il profumo dei fiori che mi  portavo,  se  chiudo  gli
 occhi sento l'odore del grano maturo, sento nelle narici e nella gola
 la polvere che si levava dai campi dove quella notte ci  sdraiammo  a

 @{b}"MANDIARGUE'S GREAT THEATER"@{ub}

 In the silence of the long afternoon, the boy  picked  up  the  dusty
 book,  opened it and read... Many years ago, at the conclusion of the
 season, the Great Khan ordered that the triumphs of  that  season  be
 preserved  for  posterity,  and that a display be created which would
 let future centuries know the high standard which the  drama  of  his
 age  had  attained.  As  a consequence, the actors and actresses were
 strangled, then disemboweled and mummified and stuffed  inside  their
 wax effigies.
  
 Now  these  coldly elegant personages perform in their static way for
 several weeks each year. Eventually,  however,  the  roof  above  the
 stage  collapsed  and for some reason it has never been repaired. The
 season, of course, extends through the fall to early winter, so  when
 the  curtain  goes  up the audience is, likely as not, greeted with a
 blast of cold air, or, on evenings when wind and rain join  together,
 a cold mist or spray that intermittently advances from the stage like
 the patrols or probing attacks of  a  forward  thrusting  army.  Most
 dramatic  are  those  evenings at the tail end of the season when the
 troupe presents the most famous works in its repertoire and flecks of
 snow  drift  from the stage outward, flying, hovering, then alighting
 on the heads and coats of the audience. The audience, of course,  all
 wear  coats  --  heavy coats late in the season, lighter coats in the
 early weeks. As the play proceeds they begin to fidget,  or  hug  and
 pat themselves to keep warm, but few leave before the end.

 There  has  been some talk that the seasons are not what they used to
 be, that the overall quality of the performances has  declined.  Some
 of  these  critics  point to the curious reluctance of the Masters to
 renovate or replace the costumes, the backdrops, and the props. Wind,
 rain  and  snow  have  taken  their  toll on all of these. Though the
 Masters are assiduous in assisting the players to their proper places
 before the curtain goes up -- they never fail to guide the performers
 to the exact spot which long experience has determined to  best  mime
 or approximate the full action of that particular play -- they ignore
 the merely technical or non-human aspects  of  the  performance.  One
 school  of  thought,  by  turns  viewed  as bafflingly avant garde or
 hopelessly reactionary, commends this state of affairs; a  contending
 school  condemns  it; most take no notice and express few opinions on
 the  subject  apart  from  some  scattershot  and  partially   formed
 preferences for colored spotlights, recorded music, more attractively
 printed  programs,  popcorn,  and  perhaps   drinks   served   during
 intermission on the English model.

 None  of  these things have come to pass, for the mass of people have
 preferences without passion, and anyway a whole new set of traditions
 has  arisen  to  rectify  these  supposed  defects.  For instance, an
 amazing profusion of street vendors are to be found in  the  vicinity
 of  the  Great Theater, and the illicit consumption of alcohol during
 performances has evolved its own peculiar etiquette,  a  supple  code
 which  changes  as  to drink and means of consumption (flask, plastic
 bag, straw extending from hidden bottle) according to the play  being
 performed. Of course these responses and customs have evolved slowly;
 the plays themselves evolve more slowly still...

 He heard his mother calling and looked up from the book  to  see  the
 long  shadows  slanting  across  the  yard. Above them the pale moon,
 balanced on the lip of the horizon, was putting an early end  to  the
 day.  He put the book down and walked toward the attic door, brushing
 the old clothes on their hooks and hangers as he went.
 


 @{b}"SKIRMISH"@{ub}

 He could hear the old woman talking in the next house while he ate  a
 bowl of soup and shared a bottle of beer with the corporal. He'd been
 with the corporal for two weeks now.

 Two days ago he had seen his first action. They were with some  local
 men...just  sitting...when  about  ten of the enemy came walking down
 the road. They opened up, then got out before the enemy could  return
 any  effective  fire.  They  got  one. At least that's what everybody
 said. He didn't see it, but the corporal and some of  the  local  men
 said  the first few shots brought the enemy's point man down. He went
 down grabbing his leg, they said, and crawled into  the  bushes.  The
 fact  that  shots had been exchanged -- a real fight -- made him feel
 like a legendary warrior of old. Sort of.

 The corporal was pretty casual about the whole thing, having survived
 a  lot  of fights. That made him feel better, more confident, knowing
 the corporal had never even been seriously wounded. A little  better.
 A lot of the men with the corporal hadn't made it.

 He'd just borrowed a cigarette when the rumbling became audible.

 "APCs,"  said  the  corporal. "They come by here two or three times a
 week about this time. Don't worry, they never stop. The bastards  are
 afraid to stop." He did some serious smoking in the darkening room as
 the sound of the tracks grew louder.  And  then  they  stopped.  That
 quiet  was the loudest sound he'd ever heard. For a moment. Until the
 whole sky broke loose.  The  tracks'  .30  caliber  and  .50  caliber
 machine  guns  opened up in concert. He threw himself into one of the
 shelters...the holes...in the floor. Plaster and dirt rained  on  his
 face  and  through closed eyes he seemed to see the small house being
 ripped apart. The  sound  of  breaking  glass  and  pottery...louder,
 almost -- and more frightening -- than the sound of the guns. A whiff
 of smoke. Something was on fire. He prayed they'd stop  shooting  and
 come  and  take  him  prisoner.  Even if they'd just ease up a bit he
 could get out of the hole and try to surrender.

 And then it was over. They'd stopped. He laid in the hole,  his  eyes
 shut tight, waiting for them to come and get him.

 Nobody came. He could hear them, but nobody came. He opened his eyes,
 raised himself, and looked around. The corporal looked like he'd been
 dead  for  a  week.  The  smoke  was coming from the next house over.
 Across the field, distant laughter.

 His rifle was lying on the floor, the stock chewed up  by  a  bullet,
 but  otherwise OK. He crawled out of the hole, grabbed his rifle, and
 made his way across the floor towards the back door. A thought struck
 him. He turned and crawled back to the corporal. Careful not to touch
 the body, he went through the dead man's pockets.  He  stopped  again
 when  he  reached the back gate. It had been knocked down by bullets.
 He lay there on the damp dirt of the back yard,  staring  up  at  the
 space where the gate had been, the splintered gate post flickering in
 the light from the burning house.  Behind  him,  the  still  cheerful
 voices, and an occasional random shot.

 He  got  up and walked through the gate, across the small garden, and
 into the forest. After a couple  minutes  he  stopped.  He  could  no
 longer  hear voices or see fires. Leaning his rifle against a tree he
 searched through his pockets. He found the corporal's lighter  and  a
 nearly  full pack of cigarettes. He lit one, picked up the rifle, and
 walked on.

                            @{i}By Alan Catlin@{ui}


 I've never actually left The Nam, maybe  that's  a  big  part  of  my
 problem  in  this  life. The more I think about it, the more I become
 convinced that I'm one of those people born to fight a ghost war with
 shadows  in  a  jungle  at the end of the mind. How could anyone ever
 leave that kind of war behind?

 The dream Vietnam will be forever imprinted upon my  mind  like  some
 kind  of cerebral tattoo. The visions that go along with it are whole
 layers of life lifting off the earth fueled by  napalm,  streamlining
 everything  in  its'  path  completely  out of existence. Life after,
 gradually became a gigantic horde of hopped  up  fire  ants  crawling
 inside  my dreaming, digging under my skin and never leaving. I can't
 actually remember feeling any kind  of  release  from  this  kind  of
 in-body,  out-of-life  experience  until the third pint of Bass, ever
 since I came back.

 Even as the fourth pint of Bass depth charges its'  way  through  the
 inner  ozones,  I  remember  all those nights sitting in a bunker, on
 hard drugs, counting the mortar rounds landing inside  the  perimeter
 and think, "This is it. This is how i became what I am, a man sitting
 in darkness, somewhere beyond the edge of nowhere."

 I feel as if I am cruising along the tips of  the  tree  lines,  trip
 flares going off in Agent Orange hell. The port gunner on the gunship
 is a guy with an unlit Cuban cigar in his mouth, a half filled bottle
 of  Jim  Beam  in  one hand and an M-16 in the other, waiting for the
 action to happen. Even twenty five years after the  fact,  that  port
 gunner looks exactly as I would have when I was 19.

 The  music  that  accompanies  these visions in and out of time is by
 Jefferson Airplane and we are spiraling out of the sky to touch  down
 with  fire.  My  right hand man is Air Head and he is saying that the
 concussive shock of all those nights spent out in the field,  hugging
 the  ground,  absorbing  the vibrations from B-52 runs and doing acid
 has finally warped what little that was left  of  my  brain.  "Hell,"
 Airhead  says,"  Pretty  soon you'll think that you're back in Kansas
 with Auntie Em. what the hell you going to do  for  a  connection  in
 Kansas, son?"

 "Beats me?" I say.

 "Open  your  eyes, son," A.H. says, "Dig the scenery, the way of life
 here. I mean, where else do the palm trees  glow  at  night  and  the
 paisley  colored  ants  sing Sgt. Pepper's Lonely hearts Club Band in
 Viet Ham Ese? This is the living end, son, enjoy it while you can and
 stay  off  the  hallucinogens. Pretty soon you'll be hearing Chairman
 Mao making radio  contact  through  some  special  frequency  in  the
 fillings of your teeth and it's all over then, padre. Keep to the low
 level drugs and alcohol for the field and leave  the  hard  shit  for
 R&R. Take it from one who knows."

 "Whatever you say, A.H., you're the pro." I say.

 "And don't you ever forget it."

 How  could  I  ever forget A.H.? He was the kind of guy who liked the
 shit And the fan, dug the field because out there  he  was  in  total
 control,  able  to  run  his  own  kind  of  mission with his special
 objectives. A.H. was what happens when someone allows a well trained,
 heavily  armed twenty year old with a Grim Reaper Complex loose, with
 no one to stop him.

 "Just remember Old son, never go into the field without a short  arm,
 completely loaded. You never know what you might need out there."

 "----whatever you say, A.H." I say.

 "Excuse me." she says.

 I  open  my  eyes  and  see  this girl sipping a Long Island Iced Tea
 through a straw and wonder how  she  could  have  ended  up  in  this
 bunker.  She  hadn't been there when the incoming started. No one was
 actually. Not even me.

 The incoming is a shit storm of sound from the disc  playing  monster
 juke  in the corner of the room. I think that my dead ear drums would
 bleed all over again from the mind boggling decibel level of  Guns  &
 Roses wiping out all life in the back room.

 "There  is  no  reason to be rude, we haven't even actually met." she
 says.

 She isn't from any  war  zone  I  remember.  There  is  something  so
 incredibly  youthful  about her that suggests years of probation just
 thinking about touching her. Maybe even hard time.

 So I decide to buy her a drink. I'd done plenty of hard time already.
 What's a few more years in stir among friends?

 "Doctor  Death,"  I say, "Another pint of your finest bass Ale for me
 and whatever the lady is drinking."

 "A little bit late in the month for your welfare check, Ray. You  got
 any president's faces I might recognize?"

 "I put in more overtime in the last two weeks than you've done in ten
 years, clown."

 "We don't do tabs here, Ray, you know that  and  you're  light  three
 pints already."

 "It's a good thing I love you or else they'd be picking pieces of you
 out of a dumpster in Cleveland for weeks."

 I peel off two Andy Jacksons from the wad and lay them  on  the  wood
 and say to Dr. Death,"Here's the hard stuff, do your worst."

 To her I say,"What do you think?"

 "Think about what?" she says.

 "Anything.   How   about   Wittgenstein's  theory  of  transcendental
 linguistics or maybe the new starting lineup of the New York Mets?"

 "What?"

 "I'm sorry, the shrooms I took like hours ago are wearing off  and  I
 had  this  incredible nightmare. I dreamt I woke up straight for like
 the first time since I was ten."

 "You have shrooms?"

 "Had, sweet thing."

 "Can you get more? I love shrooms."

 "Could but it might take a long time to get to Cleveland even by  fax
 machine."

 "Why Cleveland?"

 "It's  the  end  of  the  earth,  babe,  the  phrase Shit Happens was
 invented there."

 It wouldn't take a genius to see that I was doing bad time with  this
 babe.  At  best,  I  was a one-free-drink-weirdo- in old army clothes
 with a strange rap and an aura that went out of style with  the  fall
 of  Saigon. Eventually it clicks why she is hanging out: I might have
 access to dangerous drugs and bucks to ply the recalcitrant Doctor  D
 with.

 "She's taking you for a ride, Raymond." Doctor Death counseled.

 "I've  been  on  rides  before,  Doctor. I used to do R&R riding tail
 gunner on Big Birds for  fun,  chugging  Mr.  Beam  from  the  bottle
 straight and shooting every moving thing from one end of the delta to
 the next."

 "Must have made you one hell of a popular guy."

 "I got more KIA's that three Thai Gods could count."

 "Still, you were a lot younger then, in better shape  and  on  better
 drugs."

 "What are you, my conscience? I've been on drugs all my life."

 I  was exaggerating, as always, and the Doctor knew it. Still she was
 young enough to be impressed by a strange line and a wad of twenties.
 All  I needed to be the epitome of weirdness was a swastika carved in
 my forehead and "Born to Raise  Hell"  tattooed  on  my  forearm.  It
 didn't  help  that  Doctor  D  was  publicly teasing me about all the
 atrocities I had committed and he wasn't talking  about  my  tour  of
 duty. It's tough to make time when someone's telling your babe what a
 pig you are.

 Atrocities. Jesus, life is one long string of things you  wish  never
 happened  and  I  was  beginning  to  think  I  was  in the middle of
 something else I was  going  to  add  to  my  growing  list  of  Life
 Experiences I Could Have Avoided.

 "Where do you get them?"

 "What?"

 "All of those drugs?"

 "I was in Special Forces. We can get anything."

 "I'll leave with you now, if you can promise me something cool."

 Cool.  I  loved  that word. She was probably a loner loser doing some
 kind of bad-act undercover drug enforcement routine and I  was  going
 to  have  to  weird her out big time. Kools are what we smoked on the
 edge, man. We clipped off the filters  and  took  whatever  we  could
 stuff in there, hard. Sometimes it was 100 percent uncut H. You don't
 forget stuff like that and you  can  spend  the  rest  of  your  life
 looking for it and failing.

 "Alas, my young friend, the Dispensary is temporarily closed." I say.

 "There's something incredibly strange about you. For instance, why do
 you keep calling the bartender Doctor Death?"

 "He killed a man with a martini, once."

 "That's sick."

 "Yes, but it's true, ask him."

 "Never mind. What do you do with what you laughingly call a life,  to
 earn a living, I mean?"

 "I'm  a living cadaver. I sell off parts of my body to see if the old
 ones will regenerate."

 "What?"

 "I have the scars to prove it. I donated my body to science  to  show
 people, especially the young, what not to do with your body and go on
 living."

 "That's a twisted way of looking at things."

 "Here, I'll open up my shirt  and  show  you  something.  See  those,
 they're  called  scars. Amazing what a homemade Cong mortar round can
 do for an unsuspecting human being. The bottom line, babe, is:  don't
 ever get involved in a shooting war."

 "I've seen enough, I gotta split."

 "That's what they all say. Hey, I thought you were like in Pre-Med or
 an apprentice narc. Actually, you disappoint me. I thought  you  were
 used to seeing mutilated bodies."

 "It's  not  the bodies that bother me so much, it's the heads that go
 with them."

 I assumed that was the final dust off and it was. Mine was  basically
 a solitary mind and it liked sick things.

 So  I  smile  at  the  hazy  image  of  myself in the back bar mirror
 becoming lost in a haze of cigarette smoke and alcohol. Dr. Death  is
 working  at his steady, frantic pace allowing that song by Billy Joel
 about a piano bar play, despite all my warnings  about  the  probable
 consequences  of  hearing  it might cause. Billy Joel always makes me
 think of "going down together", making a total mess out  of  people's
 lives  with  B-52's,  flame  throwers  and  termination  with extreme
 prejudice.

 Still the Doctor is cool about my recent aborted mission,  "Have  one
 on me, Raymond, fishing was tough tonight."

 "What's this?"

 "You're  favorite  poison,  Raymond.  Dudes  like  us  have  to stick
 together, Raymond. It's like that line in  the  movie  where  Richard
 Harris  is  a  demolition  expert  defusing  a bomb: 'if it were easy
 everyone would be doing it and then what would become of us?'"

 "Does that mean my days are numbered now?  You  never  buy  anyone  a
 drink."

 "Never say never, Ray. Besides, we all die soon. To your health."

 "Whatever you say, A.H."

 We  touch  glasses and slug down something amber that could melt down
 internal organs faster than an out of control nuclear reactor.

 Everything is unclear for awhile afterwards. The next thing I  recall
 is  the  doctor tapping me on the shoulder with this shit eating grin
 on his face saying, "Raymond, you don't look too good, you alright?"

 It's like coming home from The Tour. Everyone says they are  glad  to
 see you but no one means it.

                           @{i}by David Watmough@{ui}


 According to one Greek legend...the river-god Alpheus  fell  in  love
 with the nymph Arethusa when she bathed in his stream in Arcadia. She
 fled from him and was changed into a fountain (by  Artemis).  In  her
 contemporary  re-incarnation, allowing for the extreme distortions of
 my fiction, Arethusa is viewed in eight or nine seriatim "glimpses" -
 from  childhood  and  adolescence in Vancouver, B.C. (as the sexually
 high-strung  daughter  of  a  Presbyterian  pastor),  through   young
 motherhood  and rampant promiscuity in eastern Canada, to maturity as
 a business executive in Vienna and London. All of this,  however,  is
 filtered  and  perceived through the eyes of her close friend, Davey,
 who is a gay man. It was the author's intention to  create  a  modern
 woman  who  is  highly ambitious in a still male dominated world -but
 NOT prepared to sacrifice her femininity in order to  exercise  power
 as  a  total  woman  in  the business and political realms that still
 obtain as our century dies..

 These autobiographical fragments of my Arethusa`s mercuric  progress,
 so far seen only on The Internet, are each intended to stand as short
 stories in their own right. The basic  inspiration  derived  from  my
 Hellenistic  reflections  which  resulted  in the current short story
 collection HUNTING WITH DIANA, With me, one book always seems to spin
 out of its predecessor.

 APT.504, 341 RIDEAU DRIVE,

 OTTAWA, CANADA

 "Zeus really loves it  here,  Davey.  He  is  much  happier  than  in
 Toronto.  For one thing he sees much more of me as I find I work more
 from home than I did there. For another he adores the Third  Minister
 at  the Portuguese Embassy who visits us regularly. Well visits ME, I
 mean, but Gustavo adores children and  actually  pleads  to  baby-sit
 little  Zeus if I have to go out. Not that it turns out that way very
 often as Gustavo only comes here for dinner and a fuck as  Madame  de
 Lacerda  refuses  to believe that her husband is detained - even at a
 Portuguese embassy - later than eleven o'clock at night..

 I have to tell you that after only nine months in this place  and  at
 twenty-five,  I  am  of  the  conviction  that  the  foreign men I am
 regularly meeting, mostly diplomats, are infinitely more  resourceful
 and  satisfying in bed than our native types. Nor is it just a matter
 of Latinos versus Anglo-Saxons. One of the  great  advantages  of  an
 otherwise  definitely  second-rate  capital  like Ottawa or Canberra,
 i.e. separated from a mammoth city, is the  variety  of  full-blooded
 males  it attracts. There is a substantial quotient of your own type,
 of course, but they are mainly civil servants and bureaucrats but the
 ambassadors, secretaries, attache's, etc. for the most part brim over
 with their simmering heterosexuality. Poor dears, they seem  to  meet
 so few attractive yet available women in their public lives away from
 their homes. And the  variety!  I  mention  hairy  Gustavo  with  his
 wondrously  thick  dick,  and  the half French-Canadian Alan who is a
 faithful if slightly decorous "in-and- outer" who  concentrates  when
 he is in-ing and out-ing and yet at the same time provides refreshing
 respect for a woman's orgasm. But in more than one  sense  even  such
 fulfilling  lovers  pale  against  the  erotic  contours  and dynamic
 performances  of,  for  instance,  the  Senegalese  ambassador,   the
 Military  Attache'  of  Bangladesh, and the Charge' d`Affaires of the
 United Emirate Protectorates whom I see quite a lot.

 You know I am not a snob in these matters, Davey. I have always taken
 to  heart  what  Daddy  used  to call in his sermons in that horrible
 Presbyterian church in Vancouver where I  grew  up,  "All  sorts  and
 conditions  of men." Nor am I a tyrant. I do not expect more of a man
 than he is capable of supplying. And as in so many areas  of  life  -
 not  least  publishing  -  comparisons can be not just odious but can
 stink to high heaven. Even so, honesty demands that I tell you  (  in
 lieu  of  the  whole  wide world) that after this stay here among the
 Diplomatic Corps I feel I am no longer an absolute sexual amateur! As
 I   have   been  learning  the  further  intricacies  of  publishing,
 particularly the international aspect of things, so I also feel  that
 Ottawa is a town where I have been subject to valuable lessons in the
 more physical realms - where I can both serve my own  demanding  body
 and  at  the  same  time learn how to interweave its erotic appetites
 with those of an independent woman pursuing her ambitions in the Land
 of  Men.  This  is  a  lesson  I`m sure I wouldn`t have learned had I
 stayed in Vancouver, even though I still miss you  enormously  as  my
 friend and confidante.

 But  males  generally  and  the  unending  machinations at the office
 apart, it is little Zeus who looms largest in  my  Ottawa  existence.
 What a divine child he is! It is really quite hard to explain, Davey.
 I mean I`m not just talking as a doting mother though I`m quite aware
 I  am all of that. But he makes me think of much more than the row of
 delicious  tiny  bubbles  on  those  perfect  little  lips,  or   the
 unexpected  smile that could melt the moon. All those, I suppose, are
 the universal lure of babies. But it is the alchemy of Zeus  with  my
 men visitors that leads me furthest down the paths of self-knowledge.
 Perhaps, who knows,  even  towards  a  vague  kind  of  wisdom  where
 understanding  men  when  freed from the trappings of their power and
 play-acting their status. Just now I  told  you  about  the  joys  of
 sexual  diversity  that  comes  from  knowledge  of the various human
 tribes and sub-species. But there is an even  greater  pleasure  from
 seeing  Zeus soften and crumble the hard carapace that men exercising
 authority think they have to wear in order to survive  successfully..
 And  don`t  tell  me that they abandon their persona with their wives
 because I know otherwise. The very relationship  signifying  monogamy
 denies  the  possibility  of such biological honesty as the fact that
 men come fast and after climax think quickly  whereas  women,  though
 slower  in  the  act,  are  inclined  to  dawdle  reflectively in the
 aftermath. Perceived by them as an attractive slut or wanton I  offer
 no  strings  of biological pretense but they are still too programmed
 by their mothers  to  really  be  free  in  thought  and  articulated
 feeling.  Yet  when  they  face  my  little  sentinel,  Zeus,  at the
 threshold of my  desirous  body,  their  masculine  pretenses  either
 consolidate or fall away.

 Does that sound fanciful? Let me put it in more homely terms. (I tend
 to forget, darling ,that your own knowledge of Straight  Man  is  far
 less  than mine and that it us women you gays best fathom.) Take Alan
 Flews,M.P. When he comes to see me he not only asks to see Zeus first
 but  always brings him a rather expensive gift. Now that is not being
 a generous father figure or practicing  for  his  obligatory  married
 future,  but  is  merely  an  extension  of political life where baby
 kissing is de rigueur. It is also very much connected -  although  in
 the  nicest  undeceitful  way - with addressing me, the woman whom he
 has come to fuck and forget the day's grime, who just happens to be a
 mother.

 Now  compare  him with my pal, His hot-to-trot Portuguese Excellency,
 the thick dick Octavo, or even more  my  Charge'  d`Affaires  of  the
 United  Arab  Emirates  (he of the bushy pubics and eyebrows which in
 texture might be interchangeable.) He is a thoroughly nice man,  mind
 you, a sexual athlete yet who remains dignified until the last grunt.
 Yet I can never get over the impression that with little Zeus  he  is
 somehow  phony.  Of  course,  there may well be a cultural element at
 work here but that doesn't explain it sufficiently for my  suspicious
 (where  Zeus  is  concerned) eyes. Gustavo greets my son formally and
 says he will have a chat with him before departure - a  promise  that
 is  never kept as he falls asleep after ejaculation and by the time I
 am up and about again it is time to rouse him and send him packing in
 the  direction of Senhora de Lacerda. But old pubics, as I am wont to
 call him - did I tell you he gets a kick out of my  pulling  at  them
 with  my  teeth?  -  there is always an insistence that he now sit at
 Zeus` bedside and provide him with a  few  homilies  and  admonitions
 before  making his farewells. It is just possible they do things like
 that with mistresses who are mothers, back there in the desert  under
 the  palms  or  something.  But I cannot escape the notion that it is
 nothing to do with climate or terrain, nothing to do with the  tenets
 of  Islam  or  the  fact  he  is the father of thirteen children. But
 everything to do with Pubics longing to show  a  western  woman  that
 beneath  all  that  chest  hair (he really is like a musk ox) beats a
 Daddy's tender heart.

 But Zeus isn't taken in, just stares at him impassively and I feel my
 son  is  telling  me  that this man who once told me that he is quite
 impervious to the presence of water and happy with the aridity of the
 shifting  dunes,  is not intended for me than other as a temporary if
 exotic diversion. Not that any of them including  the  singles,  have
 ever  suggested a permanent relationship or that I have ever hankered
 for a second to share Zeus with them in my house. Have I made  myself
 clear,  dear  Davey? I love the taut bodies of men, love their sexual
 diversity and fill a great need is fulfilled when they  are  hungrily
 questing  inside  me.  But  there  it ends. Zeus and I are a complete
 psychic relationship without the trespass of a  third  party.  Mother
 and   son,  The  Madonna  and  Child.  They  are  surely  symbols  of
 fulfillment. These thoughts are not intended as a confession  -  even
 less  as an apologia. More a term report on my progress through life.
 I have not by any means finished my professional tasks here in Ottawa
 although  I  do  think  I  have  exhausted  the  sexual terrain to my
 satisfaction and am ready to accept my destiny in terms of moving  on
 to fresh pastures. With fondest love from Zeus and his determined Mum
 to our spiritual little brother - Arethusa.

                           @{i}by Alessio Saitta@{ui}


 @{b}@{i}I@{ub}@{ui}

 Sali e scendi, lungo quest'eco di corrieri  inascoltati,  che  eccoli
 qui,   tutti  in  fila.  Cosa  attendi,  d'altro,  per  cominciare  a
 vendicarti? Ecco che ora  so  d'esser  gancio  &  catena,  dirupo  ed
 appiglio  d'opposti  sentimenti, sempre tendenti ad improvvisare ogni
 nuovo tentare, a subdoli ripensamenti che si rivelano  tormenti  come
 occhi  d'un  dolce  toccarci.  Ed  il  tuo  non  saper che farci, che
 cos'altro, farci.

 Come inerti o incondizionati. Questi oppure anche molto piu' semplici
 o  piu'  complicati, sono i plichi d'ogni vanita', che in quanto vana
 ed in quanto (ita'), chissa' se alla fine o in mezzo o ad un  capo  o
 all'altro  di  queste  teleferiche immaginarie, sospese penzolanti su
 ogni valle di peccato; peccato certo,  peccato  e'  che  non  l'abbia
 fatto,  ovvero nel non seguire ogni piu' semplice istinto che a volte
 cosi' immediato ti direbbe di  allungare  la  mano  e  di  provare  a
 carezzarla, la testa gia' riccia di ricci oscuri, che riposa delicata
 sui libri aperti, gia' a quest'ora  del  mattino.  Insostenibili  gli
 strilli  nella  biblioteca  sonnecchiante, egli usci' senza salutare,
 passando per la finestra chiusa, come sagoma sul vetro asciutto.

 Come parole, le dita ardite, che sfiorano indugiando tra il  rizzarsi
 e ritirarsi; ti tocco ma forse e' per sbaglio. E non so se hai capito
 o se non hai capito o se fai solo finta, di  non  aver  capito...  Lo
 senti    questo    dito?   Afoso   ed   inaffrettabile,   ineffabile,
 insindacabile,    incoercibile,    indecifrabile,    incontrastabile,
 insondabile,  irrefrenabile.  D'indole  rinunziataria,  si  accordava
 scuse perfette ed ignobili ritirate.  Lasciava  tutto  a  meta',  mai
 parendogli  d'aver  saputo  iniziare. I limitati successi inesperiti,
 spargevano  ovunque  l'ombra  del  suo  ricordo.  Come   un   lontano
 riflettersi  nel  buio.  Di opache essenze, di compatte coscienze, di
 orrende deficienze.

 INCONSISTENZE

 Era dunque assurdo, oppure era lecito? Attendere ancora i  coraggiosi
 eventi  che  limavano  il  suo umore? Era follia? Oppure il senso, e'
 solo una qualita' del finito, o  anzi  del  ben  finito?  Come  tutti
 quegli  animali,  sparpagliati  sulle  confinanti  aie. Cani & gatti,
 maiali & cavalli. Per quanto il ritorno  del  conoscibile  e'  invece
 ancora  mille  e  mille lontano di miglia e di leghe. Ed e' lucido il
 suo nome: ritorno, intorno, contorno. Sempre meno caldo, sempre  meno
 confortante torna ogni giorno in forme diverse; ed e' almeno diverso,
 anche se nel simile e nel convenzionale. Si puo', si puo'. Come fanno
 in tanti. Puoi benissimo accontentarti delle solite palle, dei soliti
 pregiudizi   sull'utile   e   sul   nobile,   crederti   d'improvviso
 giustificato  a  spingere  il  carro, dal fatto stesso d'esservi nato
 dietro e non sopra. Utile? Si, ma utile a chi? Come  dovrei  fare,  a
 vedere  senza  vedere,  ad  ascoltare senza ascoltare, a sapere senza
 sapere, a ricordare senza ricordare?  Io  credo  nella  non-credenza.
 Adoro  l'adorarmi.  Ordine:  complesso  delle  parole  senza traccia.
 Parole senza un senso che possa l'una all'altra donare, ne' per somma
 ne' per differenza. Anche se sempre l'una di fianco all'altra, sempre
 a caso tra mille casi. Vorrei  tornare,  triste  pure  e'  cosi'.  Io
 vorrei  tornare.  Perche'  sempre  lo stesso e' rimasto il mio canto:
 buongiorno amorino, bambina, piccina: solo per chi dovrei cantare, se
 in giro non c'e' alcuno? Il puntiglio solo mi cerco' nel ripostiglio,
 solo col mio sbadiglio. Eppure talvolta smetto di girare ed allora mi
 domando:  e' dunque questo, il riposo del guerriero? ..I laudani, gli
 allori. Questo vago afrore di sangue di cui e'  imbevuto  l'ossigeno?
 Sparse  le  membra  in  terra,  stese  l'ossa  e  bacio'  il bambino.
 Dettagli, dettagli, dettagli, dettagli, dettagli, dettagli! E  basta.
 Solo  e  sempre  dettagli  e  talvolta uno squillo e poi il silenzio,
 oppure scurrili e trascurabili ansimare.

 Bis! Bis! Gli urlarono dalla sala, bis! E lui li  guardo'  stralunato
 ed  un  poco  strampalato...  Cos'era  che  volevano?  Perche' non lo
 lasciavano scendere dal palco? MASOROMANTICISMI, che  ne  lasciavano,
 esausti,  un  unico straccio di carne, ancora fumigante d'amore... Lo
 so, lo so quanto sia ingiusto, o fazioso nei miei giudizi,  in  quasi
 ogni  tutto,  o  parte  che  mi  riguardi, ma non voglio cambiare, al
 massimo fuggire, questo  solo  mi  si  addice,  mi  si  consiglia  ed
 auspica.  Sono  qui  -  in fondo in fondo - al pizzo del tuo cercare.
 Tanto, alla fine, nulla  di  tutto  cio'  potra'  essere  esattamente
 venduto.  Topo,  topo,  topo. Il topo senza scopo. Il topo, avra' uno
 scopo? Che poi sembrano virtu', e sono semplici  a  tu  per  tu.  Che
 tanto  il  topo,  nemmeno  ci  crede  piu'. Poi, quando rientra dalle
 finestre non sigillate, il SOSPETTO, come del resto e' sempre per  il
 verbo  SOSPETTARE.  Senz'altre e troppe specificazioni. Sospettare di
 chi?  E'  la  domanda  senza  risposta  che   non   sia   un   futile
 acrobatarsi... Di me? E' di me che sospetti? Lo sai, pero', quanto io
 sia alieno dal senso di questo  tuo  rappresentarmi;  e  se  non  ero
 brillo,  allora  non  furono  solo rumori immaginari, come quel lungo
 strascicare di sottana: quando  il  suo  occhio  resto'  vigile  alla
 porta,  di  quello  che era forse solo uno sperare nel suo impensato,
 spontaneo, socchiudersi e ritrovarvi quel discreto ed unico sonno tuo
 proprio, che resta quasi a guardare sorpreso sul bordo del letto, nel
 quale ti figuri disteso a sarcofago che sospiri  &  sollevi  le  mani
 intrecciate  calde, all'adiacenza d'uno stomaco. Hai dell'altro a cui
 pensare? O forse c'era qualcuno, che  avresti  dovuto  avvisare?  No,
 forse si trattava di risolvere qual- cosa, una domanda invisibile che
 pulsa e si attanaglia. D'altra parte di nuovo,  mi  fermo  giusto  un
 momento,  smettendo  di  giurare,  sollevo  il mento e mi domando: e'
 dunque questo, il riposo del guerriero? Il sapore del sangue,  ed  il
 suo   odore,   non   dovrebbe   stare  sopra  o  almeno  sotto  tutto
 quest'ossigeno bagnato? Spesso gli ometti hanno storie inconfutabili,
 spesso  umori  insospettabili.  Ed allora, nuovamente fermando il mio
 ruotare, sollevo le spalle e chiedo: c'e' qualcuno qui  attorno,  che
 stia  davvero godendo, del riposo del guerriero? Strabuzza, strabuzza
 & sorridi, mentre gli occhi tuoi scivolano  calmi  sul  bavero  della
 giacca.  Sorridi  al  rancore  che  scorgi  nei  miei,  di  occhi. Un
 cucciolo! Eri solo un cucciolo quando ti  trovai  disperso  in  fondo
 alla mia scarpa. Te lo ricordi il suono di quel citofono arancione? I
 tacchi della mamma che portava il latte sotto la gomma  calda,  nella
 stanzetta  colorata  ancora solo di colori oscuri. poi e' come quando
 il gesto si accontenta di esser sognato: in quelle mattine che ancora
 tutto  & per tutto avvinto ai lacci del sognare, dell'immaginare, del
 magnificare... PUF! Come futili pensieri non vi  fossero  mai  stati.
 Come non l'avessi mai ascoltati.

 Granchi  arancio  che  scodinzolano,  salgono  e scendono le bussole,
 devastano i binocoli e rubano i panorami. Niente scimmie  sul  ponte,
 per favore. E per il momento niente controllori. Io solo questo dico:
 se  non  so  controllarmi  da  me,  e  non  so  controllare  il   mio
 controllore. e se invece lui non sa controllarsi e non conosce il suo
 di controllore, ma sa & con- trolla ME. Forse ha forse  qualcosa  che
 io  non  ho?  Forse  sa  qualcosa  che io non so? Per ora e' solo una
 coscia fresca, carne che casca, s'affloscia & s'adegua. VIENI  FUORI,
 CON  LE MANI BENE IN VISTA... Moi? Ma ho il biglietto, guardate! Qui,
 sul rigo in basso, e' scritto in chiaro: valevole con tutta la  buona
 volonta'. Ho una casacca a strisce chiare. E chinandosi per bere, con
 un braccio si tenne i seni. Li trattenne. Intanto, io ho poggiato  il
 cappello  bene  in  vista  sul  tavolo, prima di accodarmi al ruotare
 cerimonioso dei piedi che si susseguono e si toccano e si  aspettano:
 si  scontrano  e  non si accorgono del loro buffo balenare, carico di
 attimi di lu- cente dimestichezza. Hey! Sono ancora qui.  Ma  lo  sai
 che  non  so  spiegarmelo? Mi trattenevo sotto il sellino, sino ad un
 attimo fa. Lo sai che oggi davvero, vorrei che fosse un altro giorno?
 Minuscoli  puntigli  d'identita' rafferma, questo e' il loro apparire
 nel cosmo dei fenomeni, in libero estrinsecarsi di vizi  ed  omerta',
 di  bluff  e  di  occhi  bassi nel seguito del seguito di questo loro
 immacolarsi. Ma non ne posso piu', e non ne dipendo piu', e non posso
 lasciarmi  che  non  saprei  riprendermi, non posso chiamarmi che non
 saprei rispondermi. E' tutto in questo pugno quel che  resta  di  me,
 quel  che  ne  avanza e' soffice e molliccio ed a un primo esame puo'
 far senso, ma per tutti gli esami  seguenti  e'  proprio  lo  stesso.
 Eppure ho solo cio': vaste le distese ai piedi degli infanti, di piu'
 alte pretese  e  piu'  sterili  consolazioni.  Ammiccamenti  funesti,
 pretese d'incensi: le attese.

 Di  sotterfugi  e pertugi e rifugi ed indugi. Lunghi e stanchi indugi
 indecisi tra la porta e la finestra, silenzi  e  fragili  discorsi  a
 mezzo. Se restiamo ancora un poco, forse aprirai la porta. Non potrei
 fermarti & non saprei salvarti. Oltre c'e' la luce che intravedevi ed
 il  prato  che  sognasti.  Oltre  non  c'e'  proprio  nulla,  solo un
 dispotico affastellarsi di fenomeni, che tu chiamavi amore.  Ameresti
 tornarvi?  Probabilmente tanto, sarebbe come al solito solo questione
 di un momento, di un solo attimo estetico,  il  quale  &  nel  quale,
 banale  quanto  la  stessa  sua definizione, sarebbe magari capace di
 mettere su un bello spettacolino, d'accordo,  non  ci  sono  dubbi...
 Magari  verrebbe  pure  bene, proprio bello, lo spettacolino. Ma poi?
 Poi qualcuno sarebbe ancora capace di estrarre i corpi maciullati  di
 sotto  le macerie? Poi chi ancora potrebbe aver voglia di prendere su
 il microfono ed urlare ladies & gentleman, oppure uno due tre  prova,
 uno  due  tre...  Prova.  Un  tempo  camminammo  insieme  sui tavoli,
 scalciando piatti e bicchieri.  E  le  forchette  a  sinistra,  ed  i
 coltelli  a  destra  e  poi  tutte quelle sottocoppe e quei fuggevoli
 cucchiaini di plastica gialla. Alla  fine  il  segnaposto  conversava
 amabilmente  ver- sandosi del vino. Ed i commensali (attoniti) nisba!
 Pagarono il conto di tutte le maldicenze ed  i  loro  umori  paesani,
 stretti  attorno  al  nodo;  neanche  di che piansero, neanche questo
 sanno. Ma lei, parlatemi di LEI,  piuttosto:  qualcuno  l'ha  sentita
 entrare?  L'ha  udita arrivare? Dicono che avesse dei tacchi a spillo
 vertiginosi, che la slanciavano oltre Andromeda. Dicono pure che  sia
 tutto favolame, e che gli antipasti l'accolsero invece acclamandola.

 Anche  se  alle  volte  c'e'  un pensiero che sorge fluttuando, tanto
 semplice quanto agghiacciante: proprio in  quei  momenti  in  cui  la
 necessaria  manutenzione  impone  di  scoprirsi, anche se solo per un
 momento. Perche' all'improvviso, adesso che  lui  non  c'e',  ricordo
 alla  perfezione  tutti i piu' inutili dettagli di quella casa. Tutto
 quel che disse e tutto quel che fece. La sua  arroganza  precocemente
 politica,  che  mi  feriva  riguardo  alla mia propria incapacita' di
 sostenere simili livelli di scontro: dover discutere con uno che  per
 quello che dice - e tu lo sai che e' solo una questione di parole - e
 che lui le ha solo sapute scegliere meglio di te - sembra sempre aver
 ragione...  Era  sicuro,  si-  curo  che era sicuro. Altro che i miei
 infrangibili titubamenti. Ma poi si sa come vanno le  cose...  Si  sa
 quanto  a  cazzo  procedano i miseri eventi. Eh! Signora mia... Tante
 cose, tante tante cose.  E  l'augurio  si  fa  via  via  sempre  piu'
 stupefacente.  Alle  fine  resteranno  solo  i puntini, da riempire a
 piacimento con soldi, fama e salute. Come pare che al 90% si desideri
 al  di  sotto  dei  sassetti,  che  trattengono rapaci ed accecate le
 semplici istanze della gioia, sotto forma di nuovi utensili colorati.
 E  ben  disposti,  ben  pensati,  ben  presentati.  Teoricamente  non
 dovreste avere piu' nulla di cui  preoccuparvi.  Teoricamente  sembra
 che tutti i piu' segreti incastri siano a posto: magici & predisposti
 a premiarvi cosi', quasi naturalmente, d'ogni ulteriore torto,  anche
 se   non  rappresentato.  D'ogni  ulteriore  affanno,  anche  se  non
 presenziato. E poi donne, che nude bevono alla  bottiglia,  bevono  a
 cannella. E canne, che bevono a donnella, an- ch'esse nude, anch'esse
 biasimevoli ed esposte al vento e alle intemperie, come tette e  culi
 di  marmo, come le statue di un'umanita' che non osa rappresentar se'
 stessa: il malato e la dottoressa, e poi  tutta  la  gente  repressa.
 Senza  neanche  dire  di  cose  come  amache,  pagliericci e punte di
 frecce. Come se si potesse iniziare tutto da capo. E quindi cantare e
 bestemmiare  in  qualche  complicato  codice  segreto. E poi tutto il
 solito armamentario di balle e frasi fatte, di adepti e di  iniziati,
 di quadri e di inquadrati. Lui e' della banda di Pepe.

 Ma  proviamo  un  attimino a rifare le squadre. Chissa' che un ordine
 ancor peggiore non possa anticipare il caos; chissa'  che  un  ordine
 ancor peggiore semplicemente non sia piu' rapido. E' quasi una grande
 febbre che prende le teste tutte, e le scuote avanti &  indietro.  Ha
 grandi  mani  capaci,  forse  di boscaiolo, forse di meccanico. Porta
 tutto lo sporco al  di  sotto  delle  unghie,  e  taglia  limoni  con
 impensata destrezza. Faceva il barman sull'Orient Express. Ha servito
 migliaia di drinks, ad operai ed americani. Dove gli americani  erano
 quelli  col  fucile,  delusi  per la mancanza di bufali, restavano lo
 stesso appostati ai finestrini; tenaci. Speranzosi  ed  ingenui.  Poi
 c'era  un'altra  donna,  che mi irretiva con la sua dimestichezza. La
 sua familiarita'. In un certo senso anche  intimita',  ma  bisognera'
 stare  attenti  a  non  fraintendere.  Era  qualcosa  che  non andava
 classificato. Solo in questo modo avrebbe potuto essere. Era tutto un
 problema  di  provare  a  desiderare. Forse in quel modo, alla fine a
 qualcosa sarebbe servito. Pero' era mattina  presto,  ed  ancora  non
 aveva  fatto  colazione.  Scese  nell'atrio ed ordino' un Bloody Mary
 senza ghiaccio & senza semi. Ora l'aria sapeva d'altre  capriole,  di
 li'  a  poco  dall'esser  compiute. Lui ne fece una. Poi l'albergo ne
 fece un'altra. So che chi segue non puo' ammirarmi il naso: in  caso,
 allora,  che  preceda  o che receda dal suo intento; che altro potrei
 dire, per non essere scortese? Io la ricordo col pigiama  e  i  piedi
 scalzi.  Ma non aveva la febbre. Era solo freddolosa, e non trovava i
 calzini. Procedeva saltellando qua  e  la',  ed  una  volta  giurerei
 d'averla  sentita  cinguettare. Pero' non volle mai farmi vedere come
 si staccava da terra. E questo perche' aveva la bocca  stretta,  come
 gran parte delle rosce che avevo conosciuto.

 Concitato  l'indice  d'una  nuova  categoria,  pronta  a  volgersi in
 pedanti ritocchi, in argini di fragole ed in  candide  ammissioni  di
 non  saperlo fare. Non c'e' scatola che tenga pero', a questo pulsare
 delle pelli spesse  come  corteccia,  che  premono  &  che  spingono.
 Ritmiche.  Premono  e  ripremono  e  ripremono,  sinche' qualcosa non
 accade, sinche' qualcuno non cede.  Allora  infilano  la  loro  massa
 torbida in ogni minima fessura, si sforzano di uscirne: tutta la loro
 incerta forma si adatta per  uscirne.  Possono  allora  implorare,  o
 lanciare  sguardi  lancinanti  alle  mamme  che attendono. Accosciate
 sulla banchina, mentre fumano sigarette al mentolo. Le riconosco,  le
 rintraccio  nel fondo della memoria, in atti familiari di tanto tempo
 fa,  che  portano  la  merenda,  o  che  tagliano  la  torta.  Rapaci
 d'informazione  e prodighe di complimenti. Sorridenti. Nelle cucine e
 nei salotti, a volte nelle stanze dei bimbi.  Sono  appunti  sbiaditi
 che rispuntano da sotto il mobile. Accenni d'una mappa mai aggiornata
 e mai seguita, ma che pure esiste ancora, in tutte le  modifiche  che
 vi  si  dovrebbero  apportare.  In  tutti  i  luoghi  che  andrebbero
 verificati, ed in tutte le  incongruenze:  logiche  o  spaziali,  tra
 parti  mancanti  e  buchi  di sigaretta. Forse c'era qualcosa proprio
 qui. Tipo un parco di ghiaia, o una pista di pattinaggio.  Anche  una
 larga  faccia  con funzioni di fontana; di marmo freddo ed invernale,
 ed acqua che anch'essa sembra sporca,  in  trasparenza  sulla  pietra
 macchiata  dagli  anni  d'incessante  esposizione.  Ognuno  ha il suo
 dottore, ognuno ha il suo pianeta.

 Sembrava del tutto impossibile, alle  menti  piegate  dall'abitudine,
 che  simili  masse  di tale ampiezza, e coperte di laghi e di boschi,
 potessero solcare il vuoto a tali  velocita'.  Non  c'erano  concetti
 familiari,  non  c'erano che buchi & buchi. C'era a volte solo questa
 minuscola  macchia  d'intuizione  che   si   estendeva   volenterosa,
 lanciandosi  di qua e di la' forsennata- mente, a coprire ogni buco &
 ogni buco appena un attimo prima  che  potessero  venire  verificati.
 Comunque  sempre  troppo  tardi  per  non lasciare indizi, con troppa
 fretta, con troppa improvvisazione. Invece e' spesso di  malumore,  e
 neanche  guarda  la  televisione.  E  se e' per questo non e' neanche
 cosi' stronzo come potrebbe sembrare: ha una missione precisa.  Cosi'
 segreta  che  aspetta  ancora  di conoscerla, cosi' pericolosa che in
 effetti teme, il momento esatto  in  cui  dovra'  conoscerla.  E'  la
 missione  stessa  che  lo  cerca. E non si sa che cosa voglia da lui.
 Tutti cercano di aiutarlo, di nasconderlo, di coprirlo. Ma  non  c'e'
 nulla  che si possa fare; bisognera' solo stare attenti ad accorgersi
 di quando lo avra' trovato. Avremo tutti un nuovo problema, allora. E
 non   si   creda   che  l'interfacciamento  abbia  risolto  tutte  le
 difficolta'. Ancora non ci sono abbastanza dati, per poter agire  con
 una coscienza precisa: ancora si procede a casaccio, anche se a dirla
 cosi' crudamente possa risultare tutto sommato scoraggiante.  D'altro
 canto  non  credo  che sarei approvato, se si sapesse che l'ho detto.
 Nessuno confermerebbe. Le prove non posso darle, e quindi in un certo
 senso  sto forse parlando a vuoto. Infatti mi aspetto in ogni momento
 di essere scollegato. Mi aspetto in  ogni  momento,  in  effetti,  di
 essere  scollegato. Proprio me lo aspetto, in ogni momento, di essere
 scollegato.

 Ne avro' forse a migliaia, forse a iosa, forse ancora oltre ogni  mia
 supposta  capienza.  Ma forse ha importanza? Sarei capace di passarci
 qualche  anno.  Come  se  io  stesso,  nelle  specifiche  girovaganti
 circonvoluzioni cerebrali, potessi snodarmi sinaptico sul foglio. Era
 una siepe? O si'? Come  lo  e'  forse  solo  il  potere  del  foglio:
 elastico.  Se  per  caso  ricordassi  di un paesino austriaco e delle
 quattro frecce al mio arco, con la ventosa, sul  docile  laghetto  di
 papere   in  avvicinamento.  Potro'  sfamarle  tutte?  Avro'  pane  a
 sufficienza, per non essere aggredito? Ma in un certo senso e'  forse
 troppo facile, abbandonarsi e non saper riprendersi. Ognuno e' di per
 se'  capace  di  scartare  lentamente  o  per  gradi  ogni   pulsione
 irragionevole  o  molesta,  stucchevole  o  improponibile.  Ma  forse
 proprio l'alienazione sara' madre di qualcos'altro. E difatti  ha  la
 testa  grande  come  quella  di un bambino, ma il suo non e' certo un
 messaggio d'amore. Ha camminato sul sentiero  dei  morti,  nell'unico
 senso  ingiusto.  Cercava  il  ricordo  di  una  trottola,  forse una
 fattoria di plastica. C'e' chi sguaina il coltello,  per  fermare  il
 bambino!  Come se ogni tanto ne piovesse uno su questa terra, i vaghi
 lamenti  dei  vivi,  non  sono  nulla  a  confronto.  I  loro  deboli
 desiderare, non sono proprio nulla a confronto. Adesso ti torcero' la
 schiena e la faro' scricchiolare nel modo piu' sinistro; per il cuore
 salato  di  questa  mamma  nessuna lacrima e' abbastanza crudele. Poi
 c'e' stata una risata, proprio nella stanza accanto. E si sono chiusi
 a chiave, ed hanno appeso un panno alla maniglia, ad oscurare il buco
 della serratura. CHE STARANNO FACENDO? Chi staranno evocando?

 Raffermate tutte le scialbe identita', fu per molti solo questione di
 un  sorriso,  ed erano ancora pronti a prenderlo davanti e di dietro,
 senza troppi lamenti e questioni  di  principio.  Bastava  sorridere,
 bastava  lasciarli  fare:  lasciarsi  fare.  Prima  o  poi,  in parte
 soddisfatti, sarebbero spontanei passati a molestare  qualcun  altro.
 Ora  si  tratta,  mi si dice, qui & adesso, di stimolar qualche nuova
 passione. QUINDI PROVIAMO A STRIZZARE IL CUORE! Proviamo a  strizzare
 il  cuore.  Ho  delle  idee  curiose,  che si biforcano susseguendosi
 alberate, sinche' alla fine non perdo il filo. E' come  soffocare  un
 gatto.  Sara'  questione  di una punturina, neanche te ne accorgerai.
 Non vorrai  mica  tenerti  la  bua?  Ci  sara'  muffa  dappertutto  e
 chiamerai,  chiamerai.  Io  gia'  ti  sento  parlare come una bambola
 meccanica. Voci distorte dai dischi di gomma.  Bizzarre  pretese,  le
 comiche  attese.  Rantolo e stupore, e profezie d'orrore. Il saggio e
 il suo livore nei giorni senza  amore,  senza  ore,  senza  onore.  I
 fantasmi ci provano soltanto, a spaventarti. Ma non possono fermarti,
 non possono  toccarti.  Piangano  quanto  vogliono!  E'  tuo  diritto
 peccare.  Forza  e  vitalita',  sin  dalla  prima fiala. C'e' un modo
 migliore, su due piedi, come oggi si sia giunti  anche  ai  bordi,  e
 tanta morbidezza. Segnalateli all'angelo, segnalateli all'angelo! Per
 tutte queste case lasciate a meta', per il loro  passato  inglorioso.
 Segnalateli  all'angelo!  Perche'  quando questo signore non c'e', le
 chiese restano chiuse. Vermi che si intrecciano in grosse  sacche  di
 colore,  qui  il  passato  si chiama futuro, ed il futuro e' passato.
 Berberi nomadi cammellieri autisti, ascoltano la radio  e  sanno  che
 tempo  fa. Ecco un nuovo 144, ecco un nuovo paio di gambe sintetiche,
 affinche' l'empio faccia paura all'empio. Per il  quale  il  caos  e'
 natura: e' tutta una questione di organico ed organicita'.

 Tu  lo sai che mi vuole dire? Per caso sai perche' non l'abbia ancora
 detto? Io non posso fidarmi di lei, come dell'energia di una luce che
 attraversi  il  cosmo buio. Tutto basato sui sentimenti d'espansione.
 Come le fascine che si organizzano spontaneamente, a ricondursi  alle
 stesse  radici.  Sicuramente  mi piacerebbe anche solo avere un'unica
 misura ambigua, mentre quest'uomo e' ancora qui. C'e' chi ha  dato  e
 c'e'  chi ha preso. C'e' chi ha urlato e chi non ha ascoltato. Il suo
 intervento ha avuto un prezzo  altissimo,  del  genere  pubblicazioni
 culturali  e  riviste  di  filosofia  a  fumetti:  piu' pratica, piu'
 conforti: non vedete che mani sporche? Ma  resteranno  tutti  seduti,
 ognuno sul suo posto e sul suo culo. Scrostato questo muro nel colore
 che c'e' e che altrove non c'e', sembra  capace  di  generare  strane
 forme  indefinite.  Sagome  aliene  in  un  giorno di sole. L'intento
 creativo  del  caos,  che  rimbalza   nell'attivarsi   mattiniero   e
 inaspettato  di  facolta'  immaginative. Fervide, fertili: contagiate
 dal sole, c'era bisogno di dirlo?  Quasi  la  stessa  differenza  che
 sospettava  esistere  tra  circonferenza  e conferenza, o tra molla e
 mollettone - questo si' che sarebbe stato  difficile  da  spiegare  -
 come in fondo non era capace di sottrarsi alla corrente fredda, e nel
 cruccio di poi, incapace a godersi la calda. Erano  i  rimbrotti  del
 suo  stomaco  dolente, dopo tutta quella sabbia e tutti quei bulloni.
 Maestoso il richiamo dei passi inesplorati: ove ancora  ne  esistano;
 ove   ancora   se   ne   possa  attingere.  Non  solo  mesti  ricordi
 preconfezionati, ma come una donna bruna che sollevi gli occhiali  al
 sole  per  controllarne la trasparenza. Io a questo punto non so piu'
 che pensarne. Sembra che davvero,  a  volte  possa  disinteressarmene
 sino in fondo, ma altre non e' cosi', ed allora mi rammarico di tutte
 le volte che cio' e' potuto essere, anche se e' troppo tardi, adesso,
 per rammaricarsene. Eppure che dovrei fare?

 Ogni  tanto  pure  provo  a  smettere.  Ogni tanto provo a provare di
 smettere. Ogni tanto anche faccio  finta  di  provare  a  provare  di
 smettere. E' un inganno che si inganna, un traditore che si tradisce,
 e' un confidente che si confida. E' un ramo che resta sospeso, mentre
 l'albero  crolla.  Qualcuno  avra'  occhi  lucenti,  avra'  occhi per
 fissare il buio dei fari spenti. Mentre si corre, si corre, si corre.
 Non  che  mi  lamenti.  Meno che mai. D'altronde checche' se ne possa
 pensare, qui non si richiede alcuno sforzo. Una  volta  immaginatosi,
 deve  solo  cercare  d'esprimere un giudizio. Accortosi che non puo',
 deve solo indignarsi. Accortosi che neanche questo potra'  servirgli,
 deve  solo  disprezzarsi.  E'  vero,  e'  vero.  La  meraviglia nasce
 spontanea, ove si verifichi un vuoto nella connessione  dei  costumi.
 Ove  la  memoria  non passi agevolmente dall'uno all'altro, ne' possa
 es- sere sballottata da sentimenti che  non  vi  sono.  Tu  prova  ad
 ascoltarti,  prova  a  toccarti. Non senti nulla di articolato? E' un
 codice di soli numeri, un sogno senza figure. E se poi dovessi invece
 scorgere  qualche  sagoma  familiare,  non  farcelo  sapere,  perche'
 verremmo a cavarti gli occhi. Il mio potere e' il tuo dovere, il  mio
 volere  e'  il  tuo temere. Guarda bene tra le sue cosce schiuse, non
 noti nulla? Non ti domandi nulla? Forse nel tuo sogno  c'era  un  po'
 piu'  di luce, eppure cantavi & ridevi senza tema, senza tutte queste
 frivole timidezze.

 Ago & filo, prego: qui non resta altro che ricucire, prima che i suoi
 stessi  umori  vadano  del  tutto dispersi & perduti... Presto! Ago &
 filo per ricucirgli il cuore, ago & filo per ricucirgli il  cuore.  E
 gia'  che ci siamo potremmo ricucirgli anche le palpebre, perche' non
 sia piu' offeso, e ricuciamogli anche i padiglioni, perche'  non  sia
 piu'  irretito;  ricuciamogli anche il buco del culo, perche' non sia
 piu' turbato dal quotidiano atto del defecare, nel quale a volte pare
 rintracciare  istanti  di  brivido ed emozione. Nel suo cervello c'e'
 solo il macello, non c'e' piu' nulla di bello, ci abbiamo trovato  un
 vitello!  Susseguonsi i giochi alternati a follie. Oggi aveva le mani
 palmate, oggi aveva le mani colme di facce tristi. Egli non  e'  piu'
 capace  di scherzare. Non sa piu' rinunciare. Non sa piu' denunciare.
 Qualcuno sa per  certo  se  ne  avanzera'  qualcosa?  Anche  solo  un
 angolino,   anche  un  semplice  brandello?  Nel  cervello  aveva  un
 violoncello. E che non dica che ci ha provato, se questo era  il  suo
 provarci.  Crede forse che basti solo stendere i mignoli? O respirare
 con  questo  finto  e  ridicolo  affanno?  Altro  che  svenimenti   e
 fingimenti,  qui  si parla di autentici tormenti e di incrementi e di
 sementi. Non come quelle galosce troppo corte, che  reggono  una,  al
 massimo  due  pozzanghere.  Adesso  basta  scherzare!  Siamo quasi al
 punto; tra un attimo sara' questione di riavvolgere il  nastro  e  di
 cominciare ad esaminare tutti gli errori e tutte le battute infelici.
 Proviamo a censurare, a tagliare, a riproporre in modo nuovo tutte le
 vecchie cazzate. Come il vecchio trucco surrealista dell'uomo in tuta
 da palombaro. E' buffo da far entrare sul palco, o no?  La  gente  si
 diverte,  il pubblico applaude, o no? Come reagiscono gli spettatori?
 Potremmo provare a fargli dire qualche  cazzata,  qualche  bestemmia:
 forse questo li scuoterebbe un po'.

 Quando li chiamammo uno per uno, e ciascuno col proprio nome, lui non
 rispose, ne' al primo ne' al secondo appello. Allora provammo a farne
 uno  tutto per lui, ma non rispose neanche a quello. La sua obiezione
 risuonava semplice e discreta: non sarebbe andato da  nessuna  parte,
 se  non  avesse  avuto  un bagno, sempre che ancora si sapesse di che
 cosa  si  trattava.  L'attendente  e  il   suo   facchino   annuirono
 precocemente,  e  camminarono  via l'uno nelle spalle dell'altro. Per
 chiamare la vasca bisognava solo premere il quinto pulsante da  sini-
 stra.  Sarebbe  uscita  dalla  bocca  del camino. E lui sarebbe certo
 diventato qualcuno, se solo  avesse  saputo  tenere  gli  occhi  bene
 aperti.  Non  sapeva pararsi il culo. Non aveva mai avuto il tempo di
 pensarci. E d'altronde non ne avrebbe mai  veramente  avuto  bisogno,
 una  volta che fosse riuscito ad adeguarsi per benino al cerimoniale.
 La cosa sarebbe stata del tutto automatica: lui  avrebbe  coperto  il
 cerimoniale,   ed  il  cerimoniale  avrebbe  coperto  lui.  Nulla  di
 complicato, nulla di incomprensibile, ma forse appena un  po'  troppo
 semplice.  Per  esempio:  chi avrebbe coperto entrambi? Ovvero quando
 infine il gioco avesse fatalmente  dovuto  rivelare  la  sua  cattiva
 ciclicita',  chi  lo  avrebbe  spiegato,  a  quelli che ancora non ne
 fossero stati ripagati? E' del tutto naturale che alla fine vi  debba
 essere  un  ultimo,  qualcuno  per il quale non si sia fatto a tempo,
 qualcuno cui proprio non si era  pensato.  In  genere  si  tratta  di
 qualcuno  che  aspetta. Ed in genere quel qualcuno, proprio non se ne
 era accorto, di essere l'ultimo. Spesso l'ultimo si appoggia ai  suoi
 rappresentanti,  i  quali  non  sono ultimi proprio & solo perche' lo
 rappresentano, l'ultimo. Che comunque ancora non ha udito il  proprio
 nome.  Si  e'  fatto  largo nella boscaglia, e spesse volte gli si e'
 scomposto il ciuffo, e addirittura ha ricevuto tagli  e  graffi,  dal
 fogliame  restio  che  si  ostinava  a rimbalzare indietro, una volta
 scostata la mano. Ricordo' di quella volta che gli aveva  chiesto  di
 uscire di nascosto dalla finestra, anche se non c'era alcun pericolo,
 non essendo ancora l'ora del riposino. Lui non aveva capito  il  vero
 motivo  del  suo  impaccio. No per fortuna. Per fortuna ancora non si
 accontentava di raccogliere i frammenti.  Balzana  idea  d'accostarli
 tra  loro,  al fine di ricomporre la figura. In genere a questo punto
 s'alza un forte vento in grado di spazzare la terra ed  i  tavoli  di
 tovaglie & bicchieri. Comunque, per quanto a malincuore, si disposero
 a mondare tutte quelle pagine da ogni oscenita'.  Ed  ai  loro  occhi
 ogni  senso  era  solo  un senso, immancabilmente il piu' benevolo, o
 santa ingenuita'! Ogni semplice apprezzamento, riguardo alle infinite
 possibilita' di sviluppo & connessione, poteva essere troppo spinto e
 dunque andava sicuramente respinto.

 Ma lo sapevano, lo sapevano, d'esser troppo severi: per questo in  un
 primo  momento avevano rifiutato il lavoro. Pero' si era insistito...
 Con argomenti non obiettabili. C'era poco da rifiutarsi. La citta' e'
 gia' affondata sapete? Tanto tempo fa. Crucciarsene adesso, provare a
 fare gli eroi, pretendere di dire la propria, immolarsi ricomporsi  e
 risputarsi,  scandalizzarsi  una  volta di piu', voler infine sapere,
 distrarsi, chiedere i resoconti: tutte cose che non funzionano  piu'.
 Cose che anzi non hanno mai funzionato. Senno' non sarebbe bene, che'
 tutto cio' che funziona e' male; tutto cio' che no  e'  bene.  Ed  e'
 molto  piu' facile di quello che sembri: come eco o caricatura, tutto
 solo si  avvicina,  solo  si  sforza  di  somigliare  a  se'  stesso.
 Equilibrio. Delle meccaniche giunture del Cosmo.

 Semplice    angoscia    d'un    cauto   decollo:   saremo   i   primi
 all'appuntamento, gli ultimi nel testamento - Egli  ha  impugnato  il
 rasoio,  mi  segue,  mi  incalza  - Saremo echi di ogni tempesta - Mi
 ferma, mi pesta, mi squarta - Zelo del vero professio- nista,  adesso
 sta  pulendo  il  coltello con uno straccio di daino - egli ha occhi,
 per  cio'  che  lo  riguarda:  mercimonio  di  pelli  e  di  carogne,
 sollevazione.  Essi  fanno  della  VIVISEZIONE,  non  te  ne  fidare,
 nascondi il  tuo  gatto  -  non  accettare  opuscoli,  non  accettare
 opuscoli  -soprattutto  ricorda  di  non  accettare opuscoli. Perche'
 tutto sotto  la  pelle,  e'  come  una  sacca  piena  di  nervi,  che
 solleticano  la  carne  tirata,  la  carne  appoggiata,  attaccata in
 qualche modo al cuore: innestata. E cosi' basta un niente, e tutta la
 costruzione  si scuote come un budino, tremolando d'impulsi inesatti.
 Spesso senza direzione, o ragione, o termine ultimo. Spesso basta  un
 nuovo  fenomeno,  a ripolarizzare i nervi. A volte sembra tutto molto
 facile, tutto consequenziale; altre volte si perde il filo, e non  si
 azzecca  mai  la mossa esatta, magari anche per un sacco di tempo. E'
 il limite del possibile. Come per qualche ora riesco  a  staccare  la
 spina.  Allora  ha senso rilassarsi. E' una lavatrice - una donna con
 le ciliegie, e' una fetta di cielo - un cocomero ardente - il prato &
 le  mura.  E'  un castello antico. Che si avvicina & si allontana - e
 piano piano si scioglie nel vento - e piano piano diviene eco del suo
 riflesso.  Capperi & Corbezzoli. Siamo alle soglie. Alle soglie! Alle
 vele! Alle corde! Tagliate,  tagliate,  tagliate  la  corda!  Sarebbe
 bello, sarebbe comodo, sarebbe tanto la cosa giusta... L'hai vista la
 rana, che sfoderava gli artigli  e  cantava  vecchie  canzoni?  Aveva
 occhi neri - e torbidi pensieri - e zampe ben aderenti, per ogni tipo
 d'inseguimento - soprattutto quegli occhi neri. Lucidi  &  viscosi...
 Ho gia' ascoltato, gli efferati consigli dei prodi esploratori. E poi
 perche' io? Perche' proprio io? Che quando arriva il giorno mi  trova
 sempre  impreparato,  che  mi guardo attorno, che cerco il ritorno. E
 spesse volte mi volto e mi chiedo ma davvero, davvero e' stato sempre
 cosi'?  Ma  davvero  davvero?  Guardando  & ispezionando, sempre piu'
 giu'; gettando l'occhio in quel condotto  pulsante,  che  sanguina  &
 sorride, che porta fino al cuore. Perche' in fondo, questo e' chiaro,
 ci si aspettava che ci fosse, un cuore, per quanto piccolo e sparuto,
 per quanto imperfetto e stenterello.

 E'  qui  adesso,  che pulsa tranquillo nell' angolo di ferro: l'unico
 angolo fresco di questa casa rovente, ai bordi della metropoli, Tempi
 e  controtempi.  Campi  e  controcampi:  insiemi e sottinsiemi. Avrei
 voglia di fuggire, ma neanche ricordo piu' se l'ho gia'  detto  o  se
 l'ho  gia'  fatto.  Non lo ricordo: l'ho gia' fatto? L'ho gia' detto?
 Riverbero dell'inusitato nel crogiuolo d'inattesi sogni - Solo vecchi
 e cadenti e rimesti di sfighe d'acciacchi e falsita'. Come l'acciaio,
 ecco, proprio a volte come l'acciaio - E' un riverbero  di  fuoco  di
 latta  un balenare - Saremo tra i mille aneddoti. Sepolti, fumiganti,
 strazianti, forse avremo il dono di strappare qualche lacrima,  forse
 solo  un  sorriso. Davvero. Anche se lui non ne ricordava affatto ne'
 le spoglie ne' le mentite, di spoglie, che fino a quel giorno avevano
 abitato  panni  di  cavaliere,  coi  pennacchi  e  con  le armi, e le
 lustrine  del  Dragone,  nell'elmetto  dorato  e  nei   fregi   suoi,
 allegorici. Anche nei ghirigori che ne complicavano le larghe spalle.
 Non poteva focalizzare, dettagliare. Neanche si poteva pentire di non
 averlo saputo prima:

 INELUTTABILE  in un certo senso, l'aveva sempre sentita cosi'. Come i
 troppo rapidi e molli baci che distinto e d'istinto  lasciava  andare
 nella  notte carica di soffuse e soffici malignita'. E poi quanti gli
 occhietti neri, che dileggiavano e  si  adulavano  e  si  spingevano,
 quante le mani candide, che rassettavano l'acconciatura e sistemavano
 caute il merletto, tra il seno ed il collo esangue.

 Esplorare,  trovare,  assaggiare,  odorare,  trovare  roba  utile   o
 scoprirla  inutile,  inadatta,  inadeguata, migliorabile, deperibile;
 costruirsi  la  tana,  accantonare,   stipare,   pigiare,   adattare,
 utilizzare,   legare   &  cementare.  E  poi  provarla,  accucciarsi,
 allungarsi, sedersi, ricavare una nuova nicchia , disporre per bene i
 ciottoli,  spazzare,  levigare,  ripulire.  Flaccidi  commenti  da un
 gastrico bipolarismo - scettico ed accommiatato - Un altro fesso  che
 si  osserva  perplesso.  Ignaro,  oh,  ignaro del senso al di la' dal
 compiersi; il servo e' un ciocco:  mute  frasi  le  sue,  d'un  cuore
 scarno e cocciuto. Alghe! Ripescammo il corpo gonfio, notando che non
 tutti i morti  galleggiano.  Prodotti  o  riprodotti  gli  ammasi  di
 cellule  vagheggiano  di un agglomerato, che non sia stretto, che non
 sia largo, che non sia freddo, che non sia caldo: quel che sostiene i
 morti  sul  pelo  dell'acqua  e'  solo  l'aria nei loro polmoni! Urla
 d'orango e statue di fango. Quelli  non  sono  affogati,  senno'  non
 galleggiavano.  Il  cavaliere  ha un cuore d'oro, e si fregia del suo
 nome godendosi immeritati riflessi semantici, il cavaliere: e' nero e
 mattiniero.  Gran  ciarlatore, gran lavoratore, gran bidonatore. C'e'
 un gran bisogno di garanzie che nessuno puo' dare; che non  e'  bello
 chiedere,  non  e'  sano.  Proprio il giorno di natale ci fu l'ultimo
 appello alla  famiglia...  Pacchiani  e  passionali:  quanti  giudizi
 insavi,  ingiusti,  ininformati.  Sono  tracce  di gallina e fughe di
 lepre. SONO BAFFI DA CONIGLIO! Qual  e'  la  differenza?  Un  appunto
 fresco  scritto  a  gesso sulle maioliche del cesso: lascia andare la
 mano sulla carta  liscia,  lascia  la  traccia!  Lascia  la  traccia!
 Vuotamente  meditava,  circolando  attorno  al palo. Era solo sagoma,
 confine. Era una striscia di raso che infiocchettava il suo  egoismo.
 Per  certi attimi pure si bastava, per altri si avanzava, straripava:
 c'era tutta quella roba, rinchiusa dietro i  suoi  occhi:  era  poco,
 troppo  poco  lui  era  per poterla contenere ed arginare. Ed a volte
 udiva un ticchetti'o, ed era certo in quei momenti, d'esser  prossimo
 a  saltare.  Ma l'iperspazio non lo aveva mai atterrito; per molti il
 solo pensiero era gia' troppo fastidioso, ma  non  per  lui.  Avrebbe
 fatto  qualunque cosa, per fuggire quel ticchetti'o. Il suo passo non
 risuonava, il suo sguardo non perdonava.

 Aveva imparato a diffidare dell'uomo col cuore in mano:  perche'  non
 e' quello il posto migliore per tenerci il cuore. Si fidava dell'uomo
 timido, tranne che per le piccole cose. Aveva compreso che  chi  gode
 non  lavora,  e  che  la  linea  di  minor  attrito  porta  ad orbite
 insoddisfacenti. E che il pazzo gode del suo furore. Poi  diceva  che
 ogni  fiore  reciso sara' pure un sorriso, ma ogni fiore nel prato e'
 grato ed appropriato. Seppe che doveva chiamare adorabile  il  grosso
 mucchio di merda; e poiche' il suo nome era indesiderabile, era tutto
 quello  che  avrebbe  dovuto  a  tutti  i  costi  desiderare,   senza
 stancarsene  mai - trotto selvaggio del puledro che scalcia a vuoto -
 guardava il melo che fiorisce, si schiude e  s'intristisce:  qualcuno
 lo  capisce? Aveva sempre lo stesso sorriso amaro, come il sentore di
 una cosa che si ripete, che si arrabatta, che si fa avanti & si fa in
 pezzi: SI FA IN PEZZI MA SORRIDE, si fa in quatro ma ne gode; e si fa
 da solo! Si fa da solo! Lui lo sa che siete facili al  panico  ma  in
 fondo ragionevoli, e quindi preso il coltello piu' affilato, provo' a
 scrostare la colpa dalla sua pelle  sudata.  Ma  assieme  alla  colpa
 scrosto' anche il marchio: e da allora fu senza scopo. Da allora egli
 fu senza scopo! Ma intanto genera labirinti e sembra che gli basti il
 fiato,  carica  & scarica i suoi labirinti e sembra che si diverta. E
 la telescrivente comincio' a far girare la  manovella:  tic  tic  tic
 tic,  tic  tic tic tic. Ne' usci' un foglio a righe che diceva: STOP.
 Anche se aveva staccata la spina non ci fu verso di fermarla: tic tic
 tic  tic, tic tic tic tic. Continuava & continuava, stampava e cacava
 fogli con scritto STOP.

 Credevo davvero d'essere li' per caso. Davvero, fu  cosi'  per  quasi
 cinque  minuti,  e poi vidi: vidi tutte quelle candele appoggiate sui
 mobili, e le fiammelle che oscillavano nei piattini, e  tutta  quella
 gente  affacciata  alle  finestre  del  palazzo di fronte. Le candele
 diradavano il buio, ornando  ogni  particolare  d'una  sua  peculiare
 ombra  galleggiante.  Tutto sembrava cosi' bello e familiare, come se
 qualcuno stesse per darmi il bacino della buona notte: ero tranquillo
 tranquillo...  Aspettavo  solo  che mi si rimboccassero le coperte, e
 poi mi sarei addormentato in un istante, senza dare  alcun  fastidio.
 Senza  piangere  e  senza  urlare  e  senza  chiedere alcun bicchiere
 d'acqua. Non avrei chiesto nessuna favola nuova, nessuna ninna-nanna.
 Ma la cosa non ando' cosi' liscia: nessuno fu disposto a credere alla
 mia buona disposizione  d'animo,  e  fui  scrutato  ed  annusato  per
 accertarsi  che non stessi facendo trucchi. Controllarono le mie mani
 ed i miei piedi, per accertarsi che non stessi incrociando le dita. E
 poi  mi  fu  detto  di  camminare sulla riga senza andare al di qua e
 senza andare al  di  la'.  Avevo  avvertito  l'odore  penetrante  del
 caffe',  pero'  quando  chiesi  se  potessi  averne  una  tazza, loro
 cominciarono a ridere di gusto. No che non  puoi  averne  una  tazza,
 lurido  divoratore  di  maiali!  Che voleva dire? Ero forse caduto in
 mano agli arabi? E che  volevano  gli  arabi  da  me?  No.  Bisognava
 cominciare  a distinguere! Di chi era questa nuova paura degli arabi?
 L'uomo si  slaccio'  la  fascia  che  portava  attorno  alla  vita  e
 comincio'  ad  avvolgersela  in testa. Esegui' tutta l'operazione con
 sorprendente naturalezza. Poi si infilo' gli occhiali da sole e disse
 Ecco! QUESTO E' UN ARABO! e comincio' a ridere. Ed io continuai a non
 capire.

 Allora, mosso  da  un  impeto  di  non  so  che  rivalsa,  cercai  di
 contrastare   la   pressione  delle  catene  e  mi  sollevai  appena,
 puntellandomi sui gomiti. E cominciai a dire:

 Signori voi non sapete quanto io sia prossimo ormai  alla  soglia  di
 una  cauta  tranquillita' borghese. In un certo senso avete vinto del
 tutto. In qualche altro ancora vi  resisto;  ma  non  c'e'  nulla  di
 pericoloso e purtroppo nulla di sovversivo. Signori voi non conoscete
 il prezzo del cauto approccio imposto ad una  mente  consapevole,  in
 quanto  di  consapevole in voi c'e' solo il senso della vostra oscura
 potenza del vietare e del programmare, che promana da  voi  come  una
 minaccia  tanto  terribile  da  non  dover  neanche  esser ventilata.
 Signori, potete stare tranquilli, nessuno turbera' il vostro ordinato
 progresso  sociale  & culturale. Nessuno avra' mai tempo di ascoltare
 le mie cazzate, ed anzi mi meraviglio, d' aver  suscitato  la  vostra
 censura.  Siamo  seri,  signori  miei:  io  scrivo parole che voi non
 leggerete io urlo bestemmie che voi non udirete.

 E in quel momento mi accorsi che non c'era piu' nessuno. La magia del
 loro  essere  risiedeva proprio in questo loro potere: di non esserci
 mai  stati,  appena  un  attimo  dopo.  E  per  questo  erano   cosi'
 imbattibili.  Il  loro agire si dipanava a ritroso nel tempo, di modo
 che gli alleati non fossero mai nati, e che le rocche non fossero mai
 state  edificate.  Tutto  cio'  che  scoprivi poteva esser gia' stato
 scoperto; tutto cio' che dicevi era  gia'  stato  detto!  Non  potevi
 ucciderli,  perche'  in  quel  caso non sarebbero mai nati: sarebbero
 stati degli altri, mai quelli giusti, mai quelli indicati. Lasciavano
 un'unica   traccia,   impossibile   da  scoprire.  Quella  sensazione
 d'esserci gia' stati, e d'aver gia' perduto; appena un eco  da  tutti
 gli  altri possibili presenti immaginari... Altri e sbagliati: almeno
 qui, sicuramente sbagliati. Forse  un'indagine  approfondita  avrebbe
 svelato  ogni  cosa,  forse una traccia cromosomica... Un risuonare a
 vuoto nello spazio... Peccato che nessuno potesse  pensarci,  perche'
 era  sempre  la  prima  volta,  e  la  seconda non avrebbe mai potuto
 esserci. Fin dove sarebbe arrivato, il loro Progresso Perfetto? E poi
 sarebbe  davvero  arrivato?  Aveva  un  senso  in  se',  il  fatto di
 progredire, oppure aveva uno scopo, per quanto lontano ed  inattuale?
 Ricordo'  una  poesia  che  suo  nonno aveva composto nei suoi ultimi
 giorni, ed i cui versi finali erano:

 Ti riconoscero'? Mi riconoscerai?

 E queste poche sillabe, nella sua mente che girava & rigirava rapita,
 in  cerca  di  una  soluzione  o  di un senso qualunque, queste poche
 sillabe  per  un  attimo  lo  congelarono:  erano  affiorate   cosi',
 spontanee,  dai ricordi di una uomo che non c'era piu'; e di una casa
 che non c'era piu'; e di una stagione che  non  c'era  piu';  per  un
 momento  si  perse  ad  assaporare  certi  piccoli  attimi  che aveva
 deliberamente registrato, come durante tutta la sua  vita  era  stato
 solito fare. Ogni tanto si era seduto, e socchiudendo gli occhi aveva
 detto  questo,  io  lo  ricordero'  per  sempre.  E  la  magia  aveva
 funzionato!  Solo  adesso  se  ne rendeva conto. Solo ora il senso di
 quel continuo dimenticare gli fu chiaro.  Eppura  era  una  cosa  che
 aveva  sempre  saputo.  Era  una  cosa  che  aveva sempre fatto senza
 capire: cose come rileggere un vecchio  libro  a  distanza  di  tanti
 anni.  O  di  ricomporre  il numero di qualche donna andata, solo per
 sentirla sbuffare Pronto! Ma insomma,  pronto!  ed  in  quel  momento
 poter  essere  consapevole  che  comunque  le era ancora affezionato.
 Commuoversi per la propria condizione. Non avere  una  via  d'uscita,
 eppure  essere ancora vivi. Essere GRATI! Essere qui, proprio adesso.
 Oppure la pace dopo il malditesta.  Quel  calore  allo  stomaco  dopo
 essersi vomitati l'anima. GRATITUDINE. Per tutto & per nessuno. Anche
 solo per esser soli. Ora sapeva di sapere  cosa  voleva  dire.  E  si
 sentiva  bene  per  questo. Si sentiva quasi alla fine, ed invece era
 appena a meta' strada.

 Che difatti i suoi carnefici intervennero e lo afferrarono  da  sotto
 le  ascelle, tenendolo ben saldo & ben dritto. Perche' adesso avrebbe
 avuto le sue risposte:  dal  grande  capo  in  persona.  E  bisognava
 attenderlo  qui,  durante  tutto  il  tempo che restava non bisognava
 pensare ad altro;  che  il  grande  capo  stava  arrivando,  e  stava
 arrivando  per  lui.  E  dunque  arrivo' oscurando il sole (un trucco
 dozzinale) e suscito' tempeste ed uragani / soffio' e ribolli' e fece
 le facce piu' aggressive / lo maledi' e poi lo battezzo' / lo accuso'
 dei delitti piu' atroci, perche' qualcuno doveva  pure  addossarseli,
 ma  tanto  poi  lo  assolse  /  sorridendo si sedette. Sullo scranno,
 proprio di fronte a lui. Ti ho ascoltato ed ascoltato disse, per  non
 so  piu'  quanto  tempo;  e  sebbene  tu non te ne sia accorto, ti ho
 ascoltato ed anche riascoltato,  passando  piu'  volte  per  i  punti
 interessanti.  Ho  fatto  un'indagine  davvero  completa & minuziosa!
 Addirittura ho fatto in modo che alla tua nascita  fossero  scambiate
 le culle, ed ho vissuto al tuo posto fino alla tua attuale eta'; e mi
 sono trovato piu' volte ad essere giudicato  come  ti  sta  accadendo
 adesso.  ED  HO  PROVATO  QUEL  CHE STAI PROVANDO ADESSO. Altre volte
 invece, dopo aver scambiato le culle (ed  averle  scambiate  in  modo
 sempre  diverso)  ti ho seguito crescere ed arrivare alla tua attuale
 eta'. In mille modi diversi, in mille  diverse  accezioni,  in  mille
 sorprese  spettacolari.  E  SEMPRE HAI PROVATO QUEL CHE STAI PROVANDO
 ADESSO. E non credo che questo ti risultera' strano. Non credo che ti
 sorprenderai.  E  lo  so,  lo so benissimo che mentivi, prima, quando
 dicevi

 Signori voi non sapete quanto io sia prossimo ormai  alla  soglia  di
 una cauta tranquillita' borghese.'

 Tu  d'altra  parte,  adesso vorresti sapere dove hai sbagliato questa
 volta, e magari dove le altre volte: perche' anche  questo  sai,  che
 non  e'  certo  la  prima volta questa, che arriviamo a questo punto.
 Pero' ancora non sai come andra'  a  finire,  anche  se  forse  ormai
 dovresti averlo immaginato. Sai il perche', e sai anche il come.

 Mentre  lui  cominciava  appena  a ricordare, il gran capo si alzo' e
 levo' le mani al cielo/ allargo' le ali membranose /  verso'  le  sue
 lacrime  di  sangue  /  socchiuse  gli occhi ed infine disse: Poiche'
 ancora una volta non si sono ravvisate le  richieste  caratteristiche
 di  malleabilita' e produttivita', e men che mai si sia potuto notare
 un qualche cenno di credulita' o di faciloneria, o  una  qualsivoglia
 dose  di  costruttivita', il verdetto resta proprio quello che sempre
 e' stato; anche se adesso sara' stato una volta di piu', e quindi  in
 certa misura un qualche avvertimento potrebbe averne tratto. Anche se
 non ci e' dato sapere in quale forma una qualunque  traccia  di  cio'
 che continua ad essere, potrebbe in futuro manifestarsi in lui. Prima
 o poi ricordera'.  Prima  o  poi  lo  riconoscera'.  Dunque  che  sia
 riportato  all'inizio  e che si lasciato libero di progredire ancora.
 Prima o poi fara' la mossa giusta, in  questo  noi  abbiamo  fiducia.
 Come  del fatto che sinche' non ne sia del tutto convinto, non potra'
 servirgli a niente: e solo per cio', noi ci arroghiamo il diritto  di
 ricacciarlo  ogni volta indietro. Ed e' sempre piu' dubbioso e sempre
 meno  scettico,  pero'  non  si  abbandona.  E'  molto  forte  ma  lo

 E che dunque sia proprio cosi' come ho detto, sia questa  volta,  sia
 tutte le precedenti volte.

 @{b}"COME HO CONOCIUTO "PIPPO" IL MITRAGLIATORE"@{ub}

 @{i}by Ester@{ui}


 Era l'anno 1944. La guerra infuriava e anche Brescia  (la  citta'  in
 cui  abitavo)  non era risparmiata dai bombardamenti. I miei genitori
 erano sfollati "grazie a  Dio"  io  invece  rimanevo  in  citta'  per
 impegni  di  lavoro. Quando potevo, pero', andavo con gioia a passare
 anche una giornata intera con loro. Avevo appena ricevuto, in regalo,
 una bicicletta e, pur non essendo molto disinvolta, decisi ugualmente
 di mettermi alla prova e partii felice di rivedere i  miei  genitori.
 Indossai  il  migliore  e  unico vestito, un tailleur (che mettevo di
 rado per tenerlo sempre in  forma)  poi  le  scarpe  piu'  belle,  il
 cappellino, la borsetta; ero al completo e partii.

 Era  una domenica, arrivai felice, parlammo di tante novita', mangiai
 tutto quello preparato con amore dalla mamma e prima  di  tornare  mi
 raccomandarono  di  prendere  stradine  secondarie,  era  prudente...
 c'erano sempre bombardamenti sulle strade principali.

 Tornai dunque per uno di quei viottoli in aperta campagna  attenta  a
 non sporcarmi (ci tenevo troppo al mio tailleur!).

 Ad una svolta mi trovai un carretto davanti e il contadino che tirava
 il suo cavallo.  Io  non  lo  superai,  andavo  adagio  sperando  che
 svoltasse  da  qualche parte. Sulla sinistra della stradina, c'era un
 filare di piante alte e alla base uno di quei fossati  dove  a  volte
 scorre  l'acqua  e  a volte e' asciutto. Servira' per bagnare i campi
 quando non piove, pensavo, attenta a  non  sporcarmi.  Ad  un  tratto
 sentii  il  rumore di un aeroplano che si avvicinava. Il contadino si
 volto' di scatto verso di me e disse "svelta,  su  svelta  salta  nel
 fosso,  e'  Pippo spara su tutto". Io ero un po' titubante e piena di
 paura, ma quello con uno spintone  mi  spinse  giu'  per  evitare  la
 mitragliata.
 
 Ebbi terrore ma ero illesa.

 Quando  il caccia si allontano' ci rialzammo e tornammo sul viottolo.
 Io, tutta intenta a ripulirmi dal fango,  vidi  il  povero  contadino
 gridare:  "sono rovinato, sono rovinato!" Capii il perchT, il cavallo
 era stato colpito in pieno, era accasciato a terra in  fin  di  vita,
 forse  era  rimasto  l'unico aiuto che gli era rimasto. Io non sapevo
 cosa dirgli, come comportarmi perchT lui mi aveva salvato la vita!...
 Lo  guardavo  ma  non  riuscivo a parlare, a fargli coraggio, vidi il
 pover uomo appoggiato al cavallo, piangeva. Gli presi la mano, gliela
 strinsi  forte e le mie lacrime si unirono alle sue. Rimanemmo per un
 po' cosi', improvvisamente lo abbracciai lo strinsi forte forte e gli
 diedi un bacio e scappai piangendo.

 Pensate,  durante  una  guerra  dove  l'unico  pensiero  e' quello di
 salvare la propria vita, la stavo perdendo per la paura di un po'  di
 fango!!!

 Pensieri minimi che oscurano realta' fondamentali.



 @{b}"LA DEDICA"@{ub}

 @{i}by Massimo Canetta@{ui}


 Piangeva.   Erano   ormai   dieci   minuti   che   stava   piangendo,
 silenziosamente,  quasi  avesse  paura di poter infastidire qualcuno.
 Avrebbe  potuto  esplodere  in  singhiozzi  violenti,  tanto  nessuno
 l'avrebbe  sentita,  nessuno  sarebbe  stato  infastidito  e nessuno,
 peraltro, avrebbe potuto consolarla.  La  sua  automobile  la  teneva
 completamente   isolata   dal   mondo  esterno,  la  tangenziale  era
 trafficata ma non ancora da avere le macchine  vicine  ad  ogni  lato
 dell'abitacolo.

 La  radio  era  l'unica  compagnia di quei giorni tristi. Erano ormai
 nove mesi che suo marito non c'era piu', che le era stato risucchiato
 dalle  fauci maledette di quel cancro che l'aveva consumato fino alle
 ossa. L'aveva distrutto, aveva distrutto tutti i suoi sogni e  quelli
 della  sua  famiglia,  l'aveva  inghiottito  quando la giovinezza gli
 stava scorrendo ancora calda nel sangue. Il loro  figlio  era  ancora
 piccolo, ancora un piccolo fiore, appena sbocciato.

 "Questa  e' per Nadia, dalla sua amica Paola," - la radio trasmetteva
 un programma di dediche, lettere, cartoline con qualche pensiero  per
 un  amico,  un parente, un amore - "con la speranza che quest'anno di
 scuola cominci almeno meglio di come e' finito  quello  scorso  e  un
 augurio  anche  per  i  suoi diciassette anni che sono giunti proprio
 pochi giorni prima dell'inizio della scuola. Tanti auguri e ascoltati
 questa bella canzone degli 883: una canzone d'amore".

 Giulia  piangeva  ancora, guidava imperterrita sulla lingua d'asfalto
 che sfiorava Milano in ogni angolo: la  tangenziale,  quasi  come  se
 stesse  guidando  sui  suoi  pensieri,  lambendo come un'ombra il suo
 cuore senza volerlo toccare, senza volerlo danneggiare.  Eppure  ogni
 pensiero  le  faceva  male,  le  tornavano  alla  mente i bei momenti
 passati in compagnia del marito e del figlio, insieme, e non  riusci'
 a  sopprimere  un  leggero  singhiozzo  che  non riusci', comunque, a
 oltrepassare il volume della radio.

 "Ed ora caro Roberto, e' Cristina che ti scrive perche', forse te  lo
 sei  dimenticato, ma oggi hai varcato una soglia molto importante." -
 il deejay aveva un tono  di  voce  cosi'  allegro  che  quasi  Giulia
 sorrise  -  "La  lettera  dice:  Caro  Roby,  oggi e' un giorno molto
 importante per te, vero? Sono mesi che ci stai pensando: i tuoi primi
 quarant'anni sono giunti, finalmente. Cosa ne pensi, adesso? Sono poi
 cosi' terribili come credevi? Oggi e' un giorno  speciale  e  ad  una
 persona  speciale  posso  solo  augurare infiniti momenti speciali e,
 naturalmente,  una  canzone  molto,  molto  speciale.  Molto  carina,
 davvero,  cara  Cristina,  ecco  la canzone speciale per il tuo Roby,
 oggi quarantenne. Sono i  Queen,  con  la  loro  memorabile  Bohemian
 Rapsody.".

 La  musica  pervase  l'abitacolo e le meravigliose note di quel brano
 che anche lei e Marco  avevano  ascoltato  chissa'  quante  volte  la
 riempirono  ancor  di  piu'  di  malinconia.  Quel giorno era il loro
 anniversaio: dieci anni. Erano stati dieci anni  molto  intensi,  tra
 soddisfazioni    e    delusioni,   tra   forti   passioni   e   lievi
 disinteressamenti. Poi il bambino, il  grande  amore  che  li  univa,
 tutti  e  tre, poi il male, quel maledetto dolore ed infine la morte,
 silenziosa come solo lei sa esserlo. Come solo lei sa prendere  cosi'
 silenziosamente  una vita cosi' piena di suoni e melodie. Singhiozzo'
 ancora, Bohemian Rapsody stava sfumando, si asciugo'  gli  occhi  col
 dorso della mano; imbocco' la tangenziale Ovest, era quasi a casa.

 "Ed  ora una lettera datata dicembre dello scorso anno: mamma mia che
 prenotazione straordinaria. Passiamo a leggerla immediatamente: "Cara
 Giulia,  ciao sono Marco," - il cuore di Giulia ebbe un sussulto, una
 coincidenza terribile, proprio quel giorno - "non ci crederai ma sono
 proprio  io.  Quando  ascolterai  queste mie parole, purtroppo saprai
 gia' molte cose della vita che avresti preferito non  conoscere  mai.
 Io  ho  voluto  lasciarti  questo  ricordo  che, spero, non ti riapra
 ferite  che  magari  si  stanno  gia'  rimarginando.  Nel  tal  caso,
 perdonami.  In  questi  giorni  il  male  ha cominciato a rodere ogni
 spazio libero del mio corpo, ogni piccolo angolo sento che  cerca  di
 sfuggire  alle  insidie,  inutilmente.  Questa mina che ho dentro sta
 lacerando ogni speranza, ogni mio sogno e tu lo sai gia' da tempo. Tu
 in  questi  ultimi  giorni non trovavi il coraggio di parlarmi, ma le
 tue mani stringevano le  mie  e  mi  dicevano  milioni  di  cose,  mi
 abbracciavano  e  mi  baciavano e lenivano il dolore. Tu sei stata la
 luce  che  mi  ha  aiutato  a  sopravvivere  sereno  a  questo  lento
 precipitare  nel  buio." - Giulia tratteneva il respiro: una mano era
 sulla bocca, quasi a trattenerle un grido d'angoscia - "Volevo  dirti
 questo  e ricordarti che questo giorno io saro' con te, dentro di te,
 ogni momento, per ricordarti il nostro amore, la  nostra  breve  vita
 insieme.

 Sono  sicuro  che  in  questo  momento ti stai tenendo una mano sulla
 bocca per  non  strillare,  vero?  Gia'...  non  devi  strillare,  ti
 ricordi?  Non  devi lasciar scappare le emozioni in un grido: tienile
 dentro e falle esplodere quando vuoi  tu,  non  quando  l'han  deciso
 loro.  Ora  ti  lascio  guidare  in pace. Starai guidando, vero? Si',
 starai tornando a casa, come sempre, dal  piccolo  Luca,  dal  nostro
 piccolo  Luca.  Faccio tanta fatica a parlare di lui, sai? Mi vengono
 le lacrime agli occhi se penso a lui, al poco tempo che ho avuto  per
 conoscerlo.  Piango  spesso quando penso ai suoi piccoli occhi che mi
 cercavano  nel  buio  della  notte  quando  avevano   paura.   Vorrei
 stringerlo  forte  tra  le  mie braccia, come quando mi diceva che mi
 voleva tanto bene, ma ora non e' qui e non lo  vedro'  piu',  lo  so.
 Spero solo che cresca forte, che faccia della sua vita una risposta e
 non una serie di domande, che viva per cio' che crede e combatta  per
 cio'  che  vuole. Beh, insomma, ora sto facendo troppo il padre e sto
 diventando noioso, scusami. Ecco qua; ce l'ho fatta a scrivere questa
 lettera,  un  po'  a  fatica  e un po' cercando di costringermi a non
 fartela avere prima del previsto. Domani chiedero'  ad  un'infermiera
 di  spedirla a questa radio, alla radio che ci ha fatti conoscere, ti
 ricordi? Beh, allora credo che ti ricorderai anche la nostra canzone,
 amore  mio.  Buon  anniversario  e  un bacio al piccolo Luca. Ti amo,
 Marco."

 Giulia  accosto',  fermo'  la macchina e china sul volante si lascio'
 andare ad un pianto che parve irrefrenabile. Il deejay fece una pausa
 di  qualche  secondo,  poi riprese a parlare: "Mama mia, cara Giulia,
 credo che questa sia la piu' bella dedica che mi sia mai capitata tra
 le  mani.  Mi  dispiace  per  quello  che e' successo ma spero che le
 parole di Marco abbiano su di te un piacevole effetto. Ti lascio alla
 meravigliosa  voce  di Whitney Houston, con Greatest love of all, per
 te Giulia e anche per te Marco. Buon anniversario.".



 @{b}"ANCORA UNA VOLTA"@{ub}

 @{i}by Raff De Leon@{ui}


 Ancora una volta ti viene in mente la stessa domanda: Quante ore sono
 che sei a letto? Nono  hai  la  risposta.  Magari  sono  ore,  magari
 minuti,  il  fatto  e' che non lo puoi sapere malgrado gli sforzi che
 fai. Allunghi la mano e tocchi la sua spalla. E' ancora accanto a  te
 sul letto, e ti meravigli pensando che non andra' da nessuna parte.

 La tua memoria fa marcia indietro cercando di capire come si avvenuto
 tutto. Siete andati  al  cinema  come  tutti  i  sabati,  una  serata
 tranquilla,  dopo  avete  fatto  una  passeggiata  in macchina. Avete
 comprato una bottiglia de vino rosso e siete  andati  a  casa  tua...
 Sotto  gli  effetti dell'alcool avete ceduto al vostro gioco erotico.
 Mille sensazioni, sospiri, battiti accelerati, calore che emanava dai
 corpi  e  finalmente  l'esplosione orgasmica. Benche' l'abbiate fatto
 molte volte, non avevi mai avuto  una  sensazione  cosi'  voluttuosa,
 quando  arrivasti  all'orgasmo  hai passato le braccia attorno al suo
 corpo e l'hai stretto tremante.

 Siete  rimasti  abbracciati  a  letto,  soddisfatti   e   alleggeriti
 nonostante  la  stanchezza.  Passarono  alcuni minuti nei quali avete
 parlato scambiando qualche bacio, dopodiche' avete dato inizio ad  un
 altro gioco.

 Ha  preso il cavatappi che stava sul comodino, sorrideva e sentivi il
 sangue scaldandoti le orecchie. Con  delicatezza  passo'  il  metallo
 gelido  su  ogni  centimetro  della  tua  nudita', sussurrava nel tuo
 orecchio e tu sospiravi. Un altro amplesso...

 Era tardi quando t'ha detto che doveva andare  via.  La  disperazione
 prese  possesso  di te, gli hai chiesto di non andare, di restare. Ma
 non ti ha dato ascolto. Appena si volto' hai preso un  asciugamano  e
 l'hai  passato  attorno  al  suo collo, volevi giocare. "Uccidimi" ti
 disse in bisbiglio mentre sorpresivamente prendeve la tue mani  e  si
 stringeva  di  piu'  l'asciugamano. L'hai mollato. Allora ha preso il
 cavatappi e s'e' lanciato su di te trascinandoti sul letto.  Premette
 l'arma  contro  il  tuo  seno  sinistro mentre si addossava su di te.
 "Vuoi vedere la morte?", bisbiglio' premendo con piu' forza. "Non  ti
 muovere".  L'hai guardato negli occhi e ti e' sembrato che l'uomo che
 amavi non era piu' li'. Sei scoppiata in pianto. Lui sembro'  tornare
 in  se' e hai sentito un brivido percorrere il suo corpo. Ha preso il
 tuo viso fra le sue mani, tremavi ancora:  "Scusami,  bella.  Ti  sei
 spaventata?"  L'hai  guardato  stupita.  "Non  l'ho fatto apposta. E'
 tutto passato. Sono solo un sogno e a volte divento un incubo.

 Ti amo". Ti abbraccio' e tu lo strinsi con tutte le tue forze  mentre
 le lacrime inondavano i tuoi occhi.

 Ti  svegliasti  e  stava  ancora li. Allora hai rivissuto la paura di
 alcune ore addietro, hai ricordato le sue ultime frasi e la sua  vita
 quasi  suicida.  Nel  buio  della stanza potevi vedere il suo corpo e
 accarezzasti il suo addome.  Hai  preso  il  cavatappi  e  glie'l'hai
 confitto nel petto con forza, ma senz'odio. Adesso sei ancora a letto
 accanto al suo corpo, tutt'e due nudi, e ti domandi ancora  un  volta
 da quanto tempo sei li.

 And that Wolfe's mother

 Pass the words

 Late at night

 Will sing to

 Tuned the mute-weave

 And love the work

 spogliato
 . . . . nei cieli incandescenti

 s'incolla ancora di piu' sulla pelle
 Pier Paolo Pasolini
 uccello dalle ali spezzate
 su terra digitale
 sei alieno al tuo parlare
 nel mare di vetro
 a contare i vortici della tua corsa
 ( . . . ) passami il tuo respiro, raccogli il fuoco
 la notte sara' lunga (a volte viene in mente)
 il cuore sara'  tutto gonfio
 un cavaliere si porto'
 le mani alla gola
 avvolto dalle ali
 nere delle Eumenidi
 . . . . .
 dal bianco delle pianure
 il lento rompersi alla mente
 delle parole
 Pier Paolo Pasolini, la tua morte
 ostile in un mattino di bronzo
 un tratteggio di riverberi di menzogne
 . . . .
 le bombe al fosforo
 mute, pensando al loro pasto?
 Sei tu che non potevi capire
 la registrazione della tua morte

 sparati nel fondale marino
 una vena che scoppia nella tempia,

 staccata dalla corrente
 la carne, eccitata per la propria fine
 era come il cielo sopra alla tua testa
 respirava quel cielo a furia di camminare
 nella notte.
 Adesso, tutto e' pieno di luce
 la respirazione
 fiore del mondo preso dalle radici
 sonno sanguinante e sordo
 circonda il corpo nudo
 ed e' proprio la tua voce
 che si alza dalla visione
 dal fondo bruciante dei colori
 filo di un fiume che corre nei boschi
 comincia a gonfiarsi
 nel fondo per andare lontano
 nel cielo e nell'aria che freme
 un sogno a un altro sogno si confonde
 purpureo
 dove respiro
 incavo colorato
 scortica nel cielo in mezzo alle grida.
 Un'esplosione che tocca
 l'acqua all'interno dell'occhio
 la tua voce, attraverso la tua morte per un attimo
 come una testa tagliata
 sanguinante nello spazio . . .
 e, per andare lontano su quel suolo fragile
 ma cosi' forte del tuo dialogare
 presta al mondo il battito del tuo sangue
 a noi che conserviamo quell'oscurita' nella bocca.
 Dimenticato in un silenzio
 assordante
 che non avra' mai fine.
 La guerra c'e' stata ogni giorno
 in ogni gola affogata nel sangue.

 "HER"
 (for T. Russell)

 Wet gray sky rusty butcher knife on the kitchen counter
 in the cool dark of his air conditioned trailer he sits bound
 to a chair sentenced for life by twisted metal and bloody steel
 he watches her across the way young brown Navajo skin
 legs light muscled and fine showing herself to him the sweet
 skin surface driving him mad he has nothing from the waist down
 he remembers what it was like when female flesh came to him
 in the dark smell of sweat and sex it hurts he hungers for
 her touch the dark thatch between her legs a place to put his
 aching tongue and she knows what he wants and she shows it
 to him from her window her fine brown skin squeezing his heart
 hurting him with every piece of her clothing she drops by the fading
 sun the two of them in a downward dance until he picks the knife
 up and ends the mad waltz opening an artery in his neck a pool
 of shiny blood at the base of his chair he writes her name
 with a bloody finger child like scrawl at the end do we ever really
 go away or do we climb back into the dark womb we came from
 tonight she takes it off again no one to watch she waits naked skin
 sparkling brown under the moonlight's bold caress waiting for him
 sure tonight she'll feel his touch under a sky wet with the sickness
 of death and loneliness.


 "FAMILY REUNION"

 It was spread out a cedar picnic tables among green grass
 flying insects and a slow breeze dead meat fried honey brown
 corn kernels yellow and swimming in hot polluted water plastic forks
 spoons the colors of the rainbow and beer cold sweating
 ready for mouth and tongue I sat eyes on it every bit of it
 silent rage wanting to become vocal smash meat corn break
 plastic kill the head of the table his throat cut and pouring
 punch bowl red liquid the others on their knees like I was
 the Christ child come to take them to fields bloody with
 envy and wanting but none of it happened instead I sat
 silent tearing flesh from bone swearing this was the last
 fucking time any of these people would see me again
 the next time would be on a cold slab a self inflicted
 bullet hole to the head.


 "MY LIFE"

 The rain pounded the windows and bent the palm trees
 small groups of people made for cover the sky dark
 the stench of sulfur came up out of the overflowing
 drain pipes and gutters I called him up to talk about
 the hard edge the line the thought no one wants to
 read about the desperate living day to day in broken
 down house trailers alone and drunk with their thoughts
 he said thunder crackling in the background they want
 love tress stars plenty of commas and periods the sooner
 you get this the better off you'll be they want cars TVs
 football and fuck films they don't want to hear about
 the feelings of others write about CEOs and you'll
 make print then why don't you do it I asked? The difference
 between me and you is I except my exile right here where
 I was born and you don't you want something you can't have
 no one wants to read about death he grumbled yes they do
 I shouted above the pouring rain and thunder they'll want
 to read my suicide note if I leave one. We both laughed
 and I hung up listening to rain and waiting for something
 anything to happen to break the monotony of my own life
 something to act as a stop gap against my own death.

 Un ricordo dal cuore,
 una lettera per posta che non arriva mai: spedita.
 Lo sai che fai?
 Una bella pisciata nel bosco,
 che tutto quel buio,
 una bella pisciata sul ponte,
 dal ponte,
 sui cigni,
 sul petto del fiume.
 Un morso scontato ½in questo momento
 non siamo in casa_ la tristezza
 alza la cresta, un gallo a cui hanno mangiato
 l'amante.

 La stessa ironia che allunga e allaga
 il fiume, la goccia che mi fa travasare
 fuori Strasburgo, sipario francese:
 mentre un bel direttore di coro
 il tempo e' lo stesso
 ma io non ti bacio da mesi.

 Una scena con vista
 sulla chiesa, sul fiume, d'un cote' il Cafe' Brandt,
 penna, quaderno, vetrina ecc..
 una prolunga senza elettricita'
 peccato di gioventu' che fa tanto artista.
 Forse un giorno, questo Cafe'
 mi vedra' occupato
 a risplendere di te
 che qui reciterai
 gl'occhi, quelli di una donna monumentale
 e innamorata mi mettono
 le lucciole nel cuore,
 potrei
 e ricomparire nel suo
 come un prestigiatore;
 allora nemmeno Udini' riuscirebbe.
 E` un bene questo
 forse morire
 in un golfo sotto natale.

 Quasi quasi mi distraggo
 fino a che una sberla
 mi sterzi, mi strazii la faccia. Quasi quasi
 mi distruggo, ma prima
 mi voglio vedere
 come fanno gli attori
 come fanno gli attori?
 Dribblano gl'applausi questi matador con gli sci ai polsi
 tra colonne di vapore
 a volte di sigaro padano..dall'altra parte
 della felicita'
 vanno al mare in pantofole
 senza uscire dal letto,
 sognando distanti le idee piu' grandi
 un vicinissimo universo
 patria di stelle ingombranti,
 come un re sotto scacco,
 con cieli medioevali d'un greco intenso;
 sono arcieri
 quando qualcuno si mette a zebra
 fra loro e -kalaschnikov da notte in punta- 'a luna.

 Di lana glaciale questo cappotto d'ottone!

 Una lanterna ninfomane si muove come una regina
 al centro d'Europa, anche i cavalieri
 scappano gli alfieri,  vuole il re?
 Ancora alcuni passi di danza quotidiana e scivolo
 come un'informazione
 un incidente mortale. Dimenticavo
 gli anni che compi, ma
 non c'e' scritto niente in questa citta'
 e non sono riuscito a prenderti
 appunti:
 un boulevard che non e' una scorciatoia
 inondati di torri illuminati
 sono un lungo bicchiere di whisky
 bevuto per coprire il tempo e la regina..
 ..un architetto ha macellato qui il suo croyon
 e' chiaro, progettando il tempo del tuo amore;
 per ora basterebbe un qualsiasi
 seno, giocondo
 su cui versare gl'anni miei
 e ubriacarmi d'invidia.
 Ma ora vive con un uomo
 anche se non ho bisogno di vederlo
 per ricordarmi il suo gusto
 e dice -siamo-.

 Lui era piuttosto un secco vino alsaziano
 che rimane elegantemente qui
 lei era altrove.

 Un passo schiavo dell'altro:
 riverse bianche barche festeggiano
 la nullita' del fiume anche a quest'ora
 i turisti galleggiano in sight-seeing
 in side-car coi loro obblighi o bambini,
 questi poveri battelli pettinano l'acqua
 con forzata lentezza come un complotto
 e basta
 un pedone fra i pochi
 a domandare che ore sono, dov'e',
 a moi, il re!
 Intanto sembrano ancora stelle quelle nascoste
 da un incontro, come caselle libere
 e invece vibrerebbero anche sotto il sole
 ½ma non correva, piuttosto come una nuvola
 rincorso e pedinata da un kazoo
 fece il giro della canzonetta fischiettata;
 dopo uno sputo di paura come un giuramento
 prese a recitare verso il nulla
 un tango tra le citta', viste come lettere mai spedite
 o tutte insieme: avesse la testa in fiamme
 si racconto' veloce una barzelletta addosso, piagnucolosa
 che avrebbe allagato il fiume.

 Stessa eta' questa stagione
 di teatri nei fiumi
 gettata fra i loro applausi
 ciaff, ciaff, ciaff, pourquoi
 il tuo abbraccio fra i flutti e souvenir
 sarebbe quando fuori c'e' freddo.

 Perquisizioni senili come questa
 abbracciata da un golfo di donna
 faranno certamente
 stireranno i grembiuli, faranno il the
 avendo per verita' un panno incontinente
 un languido imballaggio per l'anima che va.
 Come una canottiera.

 Io, ora, torno di terra di sale, fino
 a casa,
 e mi guardo la lingua del Reno
 raccolta in una finestra
 spingere la testa
 a sinusoide nella citta', fuori e dentro
 come una lumaca in cerca del tuo corpo
 e poi: una risata col mare
 che posso, solo
 annegare nelle voci del mio.

 Dove nacqui era tutt'un'oasi fertile.
 Ho camminato in cerchio, tuttavia
 Sono finita nel deserto.
 Il deserto cresce in me e non riesco a ritrovare
 L'oasi ch'era la mia patria.
 E cammino e cammino e il deserto cammina con me.
 Non piu' acqua ma sabbia.
 Ricordo le tue parole,

 Ristabilita l'antica alleanza
 Di quest'acqua vivrai in eterno.

 quando di nuovo fa buio e ci riuniamo attorno al fuoco
 le donne, i bambini e noi vecchi
 il crepitio della fiamma alle passate notti riporta
 e, a volte ancora ritorno
 alle mie valli ai miei campi
 non e' molto ormai che
 venne la caduta di Gerusalemme
 venne l'avvento di Ninive la verde
 venne la vivida luce che s'irraggio' per ogni parte del mondo
 per conto mio le sono stato sempre fedele
 e quando giunse la prova del dolore non mori' la speranza
 e voi che avete creduto di vedermi mangiare
 ma era solo apparenza...
 esistono ancora i miei campi
 so che esistono, alleluja.

 quante lune mancano al ritorno?
 quanta strada manca alla fine del mondo?
 Anna mia figlia fu proprio lei che mi disse ricordo
 disse al padre
 "ecco tuo figlio che torna"
 il figlio con Sara sua cugina
 liberata dai demoni coi profumi
 perche' insieme loro potessero essere
 preghiera e benedizione

 eppure anche tutto questo e' andato come fosse ieri
 come per un luogo smarrito
 dove sono le mie valli e i miei campi
 se laggiu' esistono ancora, alleluja.


 CANTO COSMICO DI MAOMETTO

 La grazia della spirale tale incontra
 la perla che e' l'ovale perfetto:
 si staglia insolente il rosso vivo
 e distrugge in me la calma, di te
 ogni segreto.

 Saperti gia' scoperta eppure
 scusata da tanta trascendenza
 conoscerti nuova ogni volta tanto che
 il passato piu' non e' tale e tu
 ancora illibata.

 Comincia piano il tuo tango
 sfila nell'ombra il gesto di cui fosti
 l'interprete cosciente e lasciva
 muove la tua pelle il desiderio
 della sorgente.

 Ecco tornare la vera energia
 incalzare il sangue potente
 ora il tuo corpo prevale su ciascuna
 idea che terrena non sia,
 sulla magi'a.

 Il viaggio piu' volte intrapreso
 dai colli innevati alle valli,
 al piccolo prosciugato lago
 termina al culmine dell'estasi
 sul monte sacro.

 Anche di questo Eden a noi
 riservato, nostro nido,
 il ricordo non gettare nell'aria:
 sussurra nell'animo un angolo di paradiso
 (anche lei,
 aveva nel corpo un angolo di paradiso,

 "EVOLUTION"


 From two lumps of mud we evolved
 unmoulded, unconscious, then came
 a comet, then the rain, then primitive
 life-forms, through the pre-Cambrian
 talks in the university cafe,
 and them the Palaeozoic moments
 of slight touches and smiles,
 through the Mesozoic and then Cenozoic,
 walks through the diversity of life,
 from beautiful jelly fish transparent
 like the cling-film used to wrap
 sandwiches, to those bulge-eyed
 amphibians squatting on freshly made beds,
 to a pair of nervous insectivores
 checking each move, listening to every nuance,
 then we became very close friends, sentient
 and sensitive, with nothing yet resolved.


 The Irish Poet

 The Poet

 Slap him on the back
 clap and congratulate
 him for he is a poet

 he can write about
 rivers and rocks

 Go on give him a drink
 for he can rhyme
 tomorrow with furrow

 and
 he has the gentle touch
 he can write about
 the birth of his son,
 or about
 making love to a woman.


 The Man

 Grip him by the hand
 for he is a man,
 by God
 he is a man
 he digs
 deep into Ireland
 by the sweat of
 his own brow
 he brings up a sod
 of ancient peat
 which he applies
 to the open wound
 while  old Patrick,
 one foot on the spade
 looks on, mumbling and
 fumbling for his
 pack of cigs
 and
 kiss him on the forehead
 for this is the man who
 can join the ballot and ballad
 in unholy matrimony.

 The Bittern

 Now see
 there flies the bittern
 in the lecture hall
 hear its booming call
 there it goes in front of
 your very eyes
 at dusk between the reeds
 he'll make you follow it
 for a while, hoping you
 won't ask why
 it was
 gratuitous
 a bird thrown in, tossed in
 for the audience
 Now listen
 to the acolyte
 on television
 reading the very same
 poem, the very same
 words, and the very same
 bittern
 monotonously flies
 across the mossy screen.


 The Plough

 Read him in the TLS
 where he is recognised
 as a poet among the all time greats
 there he is allocated
 his little plot, no matter what
 the weather, you'll find him tending
 his peats
 his mosses
 his skulls and bones
 his badgers and rabbits
 his owls and sparrow hawks
 his reviews and articles
 by failed academics and second-rate critics.

 @{b}"SPASM 1900"@{ub}

 @{i}by Daniel Vian@{ui}


 Nothing to be seen
 Nothing to be heard
 Nothing to be touched
 He sits in the musty room in the shadows
 Books shaking whenever the El passes
 Piles of old magazines
 Newspapers, photographs, postcards, assorted debris
 Agglomerated and stacked in odd places
 Multiple towers of Babel
 Blisters of dead paint on the walls
 Frosted glass in the single window
 Daylight outside but nothing visible
 A smell of rotting fruit seeping under the door
 An insidious gas
 In the year 1900 millions are reported to be starving in India
 A groaning mass of wriggling bodies
 The river Ganges brown and bubbling
 The boy Apu wandering naked in an alley in Benares
 Where is Gunga Din?
 Of whom are you speaking, my dear?
 Regarded with such evil forebodings
 She stands facing right
 Her right side presented
 Her right arm  folded
 Her right hand on her hip
 Only her left hand can be seen
 The hand bent
 The fingers touching the lower part of her left shoulder
 Her face is turned so that all of it is visible
 Dark hair, a rose pinned in her hair at each temple
 Lips heavily rouged, dark eyes looking unwavering
 The right side of her face in a green shadow
 A bit of pink on the upper slope of the right cheekbone
 Below the oval face an expanse of cream-colored skin
 A gown with a low neckline, white shoulders exposed
 A mass of ruffles on the upper arm and over the bosom
 On her left side a dangling shawl, blue-grey in color
 Hanging past her knees
 On her right side the red flounces of the gown
 Scattered green and blue and mauve patches
 She moves her right arm
 She slowly turns
 She says something in Spanish
 The music starts
 Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down
 Many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures
 British trade unions create the Labour Party
 White sleeves raised, ruddy faces, hands clenched
 We are determined to change the course
 All the mouths are open
 He passes his younger days perpetually occupied
 A variety of circumstances prevent his marrying early
 Nor is it until the decline of life that he becomes a husband
 And the father of a family
 He came down furious from the summits
 With his bow and his quiver on his shoulder
 And the arrows rattled on his back with the rage
 He sat himself down away from the ships
 With a face as dark as night
 As she sails into the room like a great ship gliding on the sea
 Shouting, the voices hoarse, a beer mug raised in salute
 Too much dust here
 One hovers on the edge of a sneeze
 I cannot breathe this morning
 Dust
 Dust
 He could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion
 A plain man cannot stand against the anger of a king
 Waves of strikes spread through Europe
 I suppose it was to be expected
 The dead man was an absolute stranger to everyone
 A query at the railroad station
 No one had seen him alight from a train
 Mayor of New York breaks ground for construction of first subway
 Through a tunnel linking Manhattan and Brooklyn
 Starched white collars and a gathering of pick-axes
 All the open mouths
 He then took me into his laboratory
 And explained to me the uses of his various machines
 His eyes flashed fire as he scowled
 It makes it a little awkward for you, doesn't it?
 Hawaii is officially a territory of the United States
 Oahu green, then acres and acres of pineapples
 Ships of fruit companies in the harbors
 Let us hope she will not turn out so badly
 The sleuths turned the clothes inside out
 Then bit their lips in frustration
 The tailor's label had been ripped out of the jacket
 The laundry mark had been torn off the shirt and underwear
 Fire reduces the Canadian city of Ottawa to ashes in twelve hours
 Blocks of smoldering wood, a gray haze in the eyes
 I always do you justice
 Indeed, a remarkable woman!
 World exposition opens in Paris
 Yellow gleam of tubas and trumpets
 Dark eyed girls with sweat glistening on their upper lips
 He could not imagine the robber in the kitchen
 Hearing a shot in the dark
 Calmly assuming it had been fired by his partner
 The sleeping husband could have awakened
 And fired at the intruder
 The natural impulse of the man in the kitchen
 That of self-preservation
 Eugene V. Debs announces he will run for president
 Mouths opening and closing, opening and closing
 It's a magnificent place, and certainly the grounds are ravishing
 Boxer rebellion breaks out in China
 I shall go in the morning
 See what she means to do in the matter
 British take over Orange Free State in South Africa
 Jeffries defeats Corbett
 The two men half naked, arms and fists raised, at the ready
 Here you are again! Do you want to see Papa?
 Stephen Crane dies at twenty-eight of tuberculosis
 I'm waiting for you, you know
 You haven't finished your work yet
 General Arthur MacArthur offers Filipinos amnesty
 Of course I did. It was delicious!
 Germany reported to be building a powerful navy
 Hundreds die as three steamships burn in Hoboken
 What must be, must be
 But it's really dreadful to think of it all
 King Humbert I of Italy is assassinated by an anarchist
 Your reputation would suffer, I assure you!
 Zeppelin airship makes first flight
 Order the carriage at half past three
 Australian colonies form confederation
 We may as well leave our cards together
 Allies enter Peking to free legations
 But she's a mere peasant! Entirely uneducated
 A mere, common creature
 Nietzche dies after eleven years of madness
 It's not finished
 Where is the upper part of it and the sleeves?
 William Jennings Bryan accepts presidential nomination
 I'm sorry to have called you wicked
 United States population reaches 76 million
 One can't praise such a voice as that!
 McKinley and Roosevelt win election
 I believe you would do it if I asked you
 Oscar Wilde dies in poverty in Paris at the age of forty-six
 I think a great many people will be jealous of her
 Sarah Bernhardt arrives in America
 I believe the world is a cruel place after all
 The Boer War drags on.

 15 gennaio 1995
 AVVILUPPARSI

 Vetusta era il suo nome.
 Si specchiava nell'oasi di un cielo obliquo
 lampeggiava con le antenne dell'imago
 attraversava compromessa l'onda
 volava via periferica
 nelle sue possibilita' e
 nessuno poteva rimpatriarla
 perche' si rimpinzava
 lo stomaco di quei succhi fetidi
 e le verruche incominciavano
 a salirle inerpicandosi per la
 vetusta. Come lei aveva previsto.

 "Anatre arroventate!" si sgridavano. Nella coltre
 sferica ostriche sparutissime
 cospargevano di bava venosi marmi
 piu' la pelle si palpeggiava e
 le mucose espellevano
 liquido
 ungente. "Verita'!"
 sgridarono ancora. Mentre
 il ventre ricolmo spillava
 subito al premere giallastri
 rivoli.
 E le scorie, come compatte, denigravano
 gia' fradici ripiani. "Come le arance!".


 16 gennaio 1996
 LUMINA

 Certo c'era l'era
 del via vai.
 Si cospargevano le chiome
 di biondo catrame

 E fremiti
 fuligginosi
 incastravano
 meri e
 distillati
 uomini pacati

 Neri
 corvini
 crini.
 Eri
 ieri
 sereni
 palpiti e
 albumose
 mimose, per me

 Neve
 sudicia
 di sporche
 oscurita'
 melmose

 Magari
 accese
 sfere swarovskiane
 si spengono
 all'albicar
 da sfondo

 Ombre chiaro-scurali
 a intermittenza
 da dietro
 papiracei
 pezzi
 l'illuminano
 ad limina.


 AUTORITRATTO STIMABILE

 Tutto
 come prima.

 Significativi
 di un tempo passato
 quei fischi di vittoria,
 primo fra mille ombre,
 modesti simulacri
 d'intenzioni appena distratte.

 Occasioni ossessive
 da rimpiangere quando
 il mondo giudichera'
 l'aforisma della vita,
 cosi' segnata da limiti valicabili

 eppure inascoltati.

                     *********

 Nessuno piu'
 descriva
 questo Mezzogiorno
 inutile
 e senza lavoro,
 la voce scritta sui muri
 col sangue di lupara,
 senza progetti
 e senza amici.

 Inutile e'
 la rassegnazione
 dei vecchi,
 dei nostri padri.

                     ***********

 Poetare, assorti
 spasimando
 un verso
 di metriche scomposte
 da deliranti fremiti
 di liberta'

                     ***********

 I

 Ci manca sempre
 qualche cosa,

 un sorriso,
 una nota,
 un niente,

 per completare
 di contentezza
 questo nostro divino, noioso
 essere.

 Vorrei, amore mio, averti a me
 per scoprire il sapore delle tue
 labbra, selvagge fragole del bosco
 e perdermi nei tuoi occhi neri
 di lava ruvida e incandescente
 che, inesorabile, ridiscende
 le mie membra. Il tuo lungo profilo,
 che ancora sta dormendo e' come
 un curvo e placido orizzonte
 d'alba, mezzogiorno e plenilunio,
 dove pure stamattina il sole
 posera' le sue calde carezze
 ornando di merletti il seno,
 rischiarando la tua pelle,
 vellutata di fresco desiderio.
 Rondini ed usignoli donano
 a te il loro canto ed il puro
 gelsomino nato tra i roveti
 senza linfa, senza amore, incarna

 il miracolo immenso della musica,
 delle gocce d'oro scoperte nella pietra,
 della malinconica quiete delle stagioni,

 delle stolte mie illusioni
 per cui questa canzone restera'
 come un fiore tra i giardini che
 ti sola coglierai, portandone
 sul corpo l'essenza imperitura.
