<H1>Fashion Magazine Information</H1>
<IMG SRC="../images/line1.jpg">
<P>
Welcome ! As you would suspect these pages are all about fashion and models. To my knowledge this kind of magazine does not exist yet for the Amiga domain of users. If you
are on the WWW then you have no trouble finding sites, but if not then this could be the solution. As this is a preview issue I've only made a general picture library. If you would like to see other topics/articles included then let me know. I will include reader mail/articles in next issues. So come on !!! Send stories/articles/mail... Since
this is a FREE magazine, all submitted material will not be compensated.
</P>
<P>Sponsors are welcome also !

<P>If you are a model you may send your details and a photo to present yourself to the
world. But, take care, I am not a fashion agency.
</P>
<P>
<H1>Enjoy the show !</H1>
