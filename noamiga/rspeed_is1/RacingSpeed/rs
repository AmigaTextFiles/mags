Failed to retain their winning form of 1995 when they won eleven of

Dominated the season winning 69% of the season's 16 races. The
combination still not 100% reliable after sufering a number of
problems with reliability (mostly for Damon Hill) although very close
to Benetton's 1995 finishing record. Renault's edge over the rest of

The dominant team of the late eighties and early ninetys failed to get

With a big sponser on board this season, a works engine and some      
promising Estoril tests a lot was expected of Jordan this season but
still they failed to win a race. The problem was not with the engine -
the Peugeot was arguably the most powerful in Formula One - but with the

As they seem to do every year, Sauber came into the championship as

Started the season well but was unable to maintain form as Tom
Walkinshaw's TWR outfit took over. The chassis' designer (Allan       
Jenkins) left for Stewert Grand Prix making understanding the chassis 
difficult and testing and development time was limited due to the

Began the season with basicly a year old package - a slightly updated
engine and a slightly updated chassis. While they could have done
little about the engine they seem to think their previous years
chassis was a Williams beater or someting. While their 1995 chassis
was good, it needed more development and the Minardi team was
generally found towards the rear of the grid this season.

However, the team ran into financial trouble around mid season and
were never seen again after the German Grand Prix. They also got into

Moved to Ferrari this season for 'a new challenge' after winning two
championship consecutivley with Benetton. Things got better for
Schumacher through a year which included sliding off at 30mph
in Monaco. He fought back though to scored a dominant win in the wet 
in Spain and after suffering various reliability problems mid season
things began to improve during the second half of the season, scoring
a further two wins.

Moved to Ferrari very much as a number two driver to Michael
Schumacher. As Schumacher did the majority of the testing Irvine
struggled to get the car set up to his liking and was often a long way
from his team mate. He also suffered from more reliability problems
due to the team concerntrating its efforts on Schumacher.

Didn't 'gell' very well into the Benetton environment after five years
at Ferrari. Many thought moving to an English team would bring out the
best in Alesi but it turned out that this wasn't going to be the case.
The team got fed up with his so called 'tantrums' that at point during
the season they repotedly locked him in their motor home. It had been
roumered that his place in the team would be taken for next season by

Pre season people were tipping Berger as a dark hourse for the
championship but early races shown that they were wrong. His tall
figure interfeared with the air flow into the engine but as the season

Benetton drivers - in the races at least, although he seemd to have a

Things looked good for Mika Hakkinen and McLaren after he sett some

however things failed to materialise with questions being asked about

McLaren was a big come down for Coulthard after almost two seasons

The Ligier team leader enjoyed a shock win in Monaco although the rest

After 1995, Frentzen didn't deliver the kind of performaces that were

Rosset had a good strediy season, learning the ropes. He put in some

No one realy knows exactly how quick Lamy is. He has had a good

Despite showing well against Luca Badoer last year, this year Lamy has

Fisichella made an extremly impressive debut this season, fighting off

Editorial
=========

Welcome to the first ever issue of Racing Speed. As far as I know this
is the first and only motor sport disk magazine for the Amiga. This 
issue includes a review of the 1996 Formula One season. Future 
editions will include things like all the latest news from the world 
of motor sport, reviews of various motor sport formulas (eg F3000, 
ITC, Formula Vaxhaul Jnr etc), profiles, race reports etc. If it's to 
do with motor sport, it could well be included!!! I also welcome your 
comments on Racing Speed (maybe you'd like to see a pen pal or letters 
section) and encourage you to send in your atrticles (especially season 
reviews)!!!

Finaly I'd just like to say I hope you enjoy reading Racing Speed and
appologise in advance for any mistakes that you may find.
