Subject: ABC News Broadcast Alert (Groom Lake Report)
Content-Type: text
Content-Length: 725
Status: R

[Supplement to the Groom Lake Desert Rat.  Multiple recipients.]

ABC News may run their Groom Lake piece tonight (Monday, 4/18) on 
"World News Tonight with Peter Jennings."  (The broadcast time 
varies by area.)

If not tonight, it could be tomorrow or Wednesday.

The ABC report was delayed due to the seizure of their equipment 
and video tape near Freedom Ridge on 4/8.  All equipment and tape 
was returned to them by the Sheriff's Dept. on 4/14, after 
inspection by the Air Force.

As of now, copies of the search warrant used to seize the 
equipment have not yet been released by the Sheriff, but a deputy 
promised that I could get a copy today when I pick up my radio 
equipment from them.
