AREA 51 VIEWER'S GUIDE
By Glenn Campbell.  Milepost logs, maps and lots of practical 
information for visitors in search of secret aircraft or UFOs on 
Nevada Highway 375, just across the mountains from the Top Secret 
Groom Lake base in Central Nevada.  Reviews the stories 
associated with the famous "Black Mailbox" and the military Black 
Budget.  Contains an extensive annotated bibliography for Bob 
Lazar, UFOs and Secret Aircraft: all known print, audio and video 
references (through Sept. 93) are included with many quotes.

at a UFO conference held in Rachel, Nevada, May 1, 1993.  Lazar 
is a physicist who claims to have worked with alien craft at a 
secret government base.  First in the "Gospel According to Bob" 
series of transcripts, recording Lazar's exact words but not 
authorized or approved by him in any way.  Includes footnotes and 
an index, plus a report on attempts to locate Lazar's MIT 
professors.  27pp in dense type, spiral bound.  $8.00.

GROOM RANGE LAND SEIZURE NEWSCLIPPING PORTFOLIO (1984-1992)
As a courtesy to scholars and political activists interested in 
the military's Groom Range land seizure of 1984, we have 
assembled a portfolio of articles from Las Vegas newspapers 
regarding the action, 1984 to 1992.  (Does not include current 
1993 action; these clippings may be assembled later as Part II.)  
Portfolio consists of about 80 photocopied pages, spiral bound.  
$20.00

GROOM RANGE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT
This is the environmental report filed by the government to help 
finalize their 1984 seizure of the Groom Range.  Comes in two 
separate volumes:  The Draft report contains a good review of the 
flora, fauna and geology of the area.  The Final report is 
chiefly a record of hearings and other responses to the draft 
report.  Each is 150pp., spiral bound, $20.00.  Be sure to 
specify Draft or Final. 

GROOM LAKE PHOTOMURAL BY JAMES GOODALL
SOC is a sales agent for impressive mural-size panoramic prints 
of the secret Groom Lake air base.  This almost seamless sequence 
of three photos was taken by renowned "Black Budget" aviation 
writer James Goodall and is available with or without his 
autograph.  Earlier versions have been shown on national 
television and were first printed internationally in Popular 
Science (March 1993, page 59).  New 1993 panorama now avail-able 
in exquisite detail for den or office.  Richly colored winter 
morning shot with fine grain and excellent definition, even in 
this huge blowup.  Almost as informative as Russian satellite 
photos costing many times more and far more attractive.  Giant 
size (almost 7 feet long): 18" x 82", $300 unmounted.  Reduced 
size: 8" x 30", $90 unmounted or $100 foam mount.  Please specify 
if Goodall autograph desired, and allow four weeks for 
processing.

AREA 51 CLOTH PATCH
Participants in aircraft develop-ment projects like the Stealth 
fighter or military operations like Desert Storm always have a 
cloth patch to commem-orate the event.  The maligned workers at 
Groom Lake are denied this opportunity because their operation is 
supposed to be secret.  As a service to them, we at SOC have 
designed are own high-quality, 8-color cloth patch, the first of 
its kind to commemorate Area 51 and its crew.  Available Now!  
$8.00.

AURORA--THE PENTAGON'S SECRET HYPERSONIC SPYPLANE
Book by Bill Sweetman.  For a plane that the military insists 
does not exist, the documentation is certainly extensive.  Former 
Jane's and Interavia journalist Sweetman lays out the evidence 
and historical perspective leading to an inescapable con-clusion:  
It can't not exist.  This is the latest word on Aurora, pre-sumed 
to be operating from Groom Lake.  This book is also an excel-lent 
reference on previous supersonic aircraft, the "ancestors" of 
Aurora.  96 pages, softcover, Motorbooks, 1993.  $9.95.  

NELLIS AIRCRAFT POSTCARD SET.  
A set of ten 4"x6" color postcards of military aircraft 
associated with Area 51 and the Nellis Range.  Set includes B-2, 
SR-71 (both above), F-117, U-2, F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52, F-4 and 
B-1.  $3.50/set.  (Individual cards of each aircraft are also 
available for 50c each.)

RED FLAG--AIR COMBAT FOR THE 1990S
Book by Michael Skinner and George Hall.  A detailed, well-
illustrated account of the Red Flag exercises in the Nellis 
Range, accounting for much of the air activity in the vicinity of 
Area 51 (but not within it).  Provides insight to the ground 
observer on what those jets are doing as they roar overhead.  
This book is a just-released update of Red Flag--Air Combat for 
the 80s, with new photos and info.  128 pages, softcover.  
Motorbooks, 1993.  $14.95

THE MUSHROOM CLOUD AND THE DOWNWINDERS
Textbook by Gurli Pendergrass and Lorelle Nelson.  We stumbled 
upon this gem in a local library and liked it so much we ordered 
it direct-ly from the publisher in Denmark.  It's one of the best 
books we've found on the above-ground testing at the Nevada Test 
Site.  Writ-ten for students of English, and thus concise and easy 
to read, this book recalls the atomic era with a clarity not 
found in the American press.  As a bonus, sidebars translate 
difficult English words into Danish.  72 pages, softcover.  
Forlaget Futurum, 1987.  $10.00.

TESTORS PLASTIC MODEL KITS
Designed by John Andrews, with help from a network of civilian 
observers he calls his "Desert Rats."  Kits do not include glue 
or paints.  All except the SR-71 and U-2 are at a scale of 1/72, 
allowing for size comparisons between models.  Available now!.

XR-7 THUNDER DART--This is the testors name for the first 
commercial plastic model of the Aurora spy plane.  Many details 
are still speculative, but the triangular shape is widely 
accepted by researchers.  The external engines are a matter of 
debate, but if you don't like 'em, don't glue 'em on!  1/72 
scale, 13" long.  Just released!  $10.00.

SR-75 PENETRATOR--Testors' version of the "Mothership."  Again, 
the name and many of the details are speculative, but this plane 
has been sighted near Edwards AFB and has been rumored to fly 
from Groom.  The shape of the craft actually seen suggests that 
it is used to launch another craft carried on its back.  
Researchers are not certain what that second craft is, but 
Testors has paired it with the X-7 Thunder Dart above, which fits 
neatly on top.  1/72 scale, 26" long.  Just released!  $28.00.

B-2 STEALTH BOMBER--At billions per copy, this could be the 
world's most expensive aircraft.  It's yours now for a song.  
1/72 scale, 28-5/8" wingspan.  $28.00.

F-117A STEALTH FIGHTER--A strange multi-faceted bird designed 
before the makers had the computing power to calculate the 
graceful curves of the B-2.  1/72 scale, 10-7/8" long. $10.00.

U-2 SPY PLANE--A plane that did not exist... until Francis Gary 
Powers was shot down in one over the Soviet Union.  Some are 
still flying, occasionally in and out of Groom.  The U-2 remains 
one of the world's highest flying known aircraft. Includes a 
pilot figure and ground handling equipment.  1/48 scale, 26-1/8" 
wingspan.  $11.00.

SR-71 BLACKBIRD--This is the venerable spy plane whose 
uncontested retirement by the Air Force ignited speculation that 
a much faster plane must now be deployed.  The SR-71 remains the 
fastest known aircraft in the world, but only NASA still flies 
it.  1/48 scale, 26-7/8" long.  $23.50.

Coming June 1994-- LAZAR SPACECRAFT MODEL.

PLASTIC MODEL CEMENT--7/8 oz. tube.  $1.39.

>From the author:  "Paranoia is a fascinating mechanism by which a 
person tends to bring about the very thing he most fears.  If he 
is terrified enough of failure, then the internal pressures are 
such that he will often create it for himself by his own hand.  
Paranoia is more pervasive than we might suppose, and there is 
not one of us who isn't touched.  Paranoia effects our every 
decision, especially our most important ones, so don't read this 
newsletter unless you are prepared to question your past choices 
or the wisdom of your current circumstances.  This is not a 
pretty newsletter.  There are a lot of icky things inside our 
minds, and THE PARANOID NEWS will delight in exposing them."
