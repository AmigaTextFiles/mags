Subject: Second Groom Lawsuit

[Supplement to the Groom Lake Desert Rat]

According to an article in Saturday's Las Vegas Review-Journal, a 
second lawsuit will be filed on Monday in the Groom Lake toxic 
dumping case.  The full text of the article is below.

We can speculate that the first suit, which was filed against the 
EPA, was a tactical move by lawyer Turley.  Perhaps, by filing 
against the EPA first, he can prevent it from coming to the AF's 
rescue.

CNN will run a story on this latest suit, probably in its Monday 
evening newscasts (Aug. 15).

TITLE:  SECRET BASE TO BE HIT WITH LAWSUIT

SUBTITLE:  A Washington lawyer alleges various agencies have 
violated hazardous waste laws at Groom Lake

Defense and intelligence agencies will be sued on Monday in U.S. 
District Court in Las Vegas by a Washington, D.C., law professor 
who claims they violated hazardous waste laws at the secret Groom 
Lake air base in Lincoln County.

The lawsuit will name Secretary of Defense William Perry, National 
Security Advisor Anthony Lake and Air Force Secretary Sheila 
Widnall, Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law 
professor who is representing employees and former workers at the 
Groom Lake base, said Friday.

The lawsuit is the second that will be filed this month on 
allegations that hazardous wastes were illegally burned in open 
trenches at Groom Lake, 35 miles west of Alamo.

In an Aug. 2 lawsuit Turley files in U.S. District Court in 
Washington, he claimed the Environmental Protection Agency failed 
to inspect the Groom Lake base, where workers said they were 
denied protective clothing for handling hazardous wastes.

That lawsuit named EPA Administrator Carol Browner as defendant 
and six John Doe plaintiffs.  Chief Judge John Garret Penn allowed 
the plaintiffs to use fictitious names because Turley said they 
feared reprisal from the government.

Concerning the case he will file Monday, Turley said, "We hope to 
show that military and intelligence agencies cannot unilaterally 
create a secret enclave through which they can violate 
environmental and criminal laws with impunity."

He said his clients in Monday's filing will include six John Does 
and one named plaintiff, Helen Frost, a Las Vegas widow, whose 
husband was a former base worker who died in 1989.

Frost claimed in a 1993 lawsuit that her husband's death was 
linked to inhaling toxic fumes while he worked atop hangars and 
buildings downwind of trenches where former workers have said 
hazardous materials, including radar-absorbing stealth coatings, 
were routinely burned during the 1980s.

A federal judge dismissed the wrongful death suit, ruling that 
Frost did not prove dioxins in the fumes hastened her husband's 
death from a liver disorder.

Turley said Helen Frost is representative of a large number of 
widows and family members who have asked him for legal assistance.

"We have decided to use only one of the widows and only six of the 
workers because of possible concerns with reprisals.  The 
government has already threatened my clients with severe reprisals 
if they ever broke their silence about what happened at the Groom 
Lake base," Turley said.

The Groom dry lake bed is the site of an active government 
installation where high-altitude, high-speed spy planes and other 
military aircraft have been tested, including the F-117A Stealth 
fighter, according to aviation industry sources and witnesses who 
have observed the base.

Turley said, "Our Nevada filing will go to the heart of the 
allegations.  We believe the Air Force will ultimately be forced 
to acknowledge the existence" of the Groom Lake base, also known 
as Area 51.

"It is clear that secrecy at Groom Lake became a magnet for 
illegal activities that could never have occurred at conventional 
federal facilities," he said.

"The use of secrecy in this case has little to do with the 
national security purpose of the facility.  The military is using 
secrecy to hide what are environmental and, possibly, criminal 
violations," Turley said in a telephone interview from his office.  
He is director of the pro bono Environmental Crime Project at the 
university's National Law Center.

Turley said the Groom Lake base became "something of an 
irresistible temptation for certain agencies and contractors in 
the Stealth program."
