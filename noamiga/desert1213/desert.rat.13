COMMONSENSE RULES FOR THE DEFENSE MANAGER

We know that the Rat is read by leaders in the Pentagon, and we 
like to think that they look to us for the sort of impartial 
reporting and down-to-earth advice they can't get from their own 
people.  We see our role as one of education.  We do not seek to 
destroy the military or damage national defense; instead, we are 
trying to make the military stronger by introducing defense 
managers to important concepts in psychology, philosophy, politics 
and American society.

One of these is public relations.  We know what you generals are 
thinking:  that the news media are the slime of the earth and 
would be an even better target for the Sons and Daughters of 
Liberty than Las Vegas.  Nonetheless, the presence of a 
bloodthirsty press will always be a fact of life in our democracy.  
They represent, in fact, one of those unalienable rights that we 
go to war in distant lands to defend.  Like the unpleasant, 
humiliating process of wringing funds from Congress, dealing with 
the press is just something the military has to live with.  The 
tone of press coverage, especially in peacetime, plays a major 
role in funding decisions and the degree of autonomy the military 
is accorded.  The military can either take charge of the process 
and use the press to its advantage, or it can ignore the wolves, 
plead "no comment" and be eaten alive.

Starting at a very basic level, there are certain things you just 
shouldn't do if you want to maintain the respect of the press and 
your ultimate liberty and funding.  One of these points is summed 
up in a song we once heard....

     You don't tug on Superman's cape.
     You don't spit into the wind.
     You don't pull on the mask of the old Lone Ranger....

AND YOU DON'T TAKE THE CAMERAS OR VIDEO TAPE OF A MAJOR MEDIA 
ORGANIZATION!

Open your textbooks to page 15 for a further restatement of this 
principle.  (We are referring, of course, to "Meeting the Press: A 
Media Survival Guide for the Defense Manager.")

   "Because of competitive pressures of the trade, the fraternity 
of reporters is not exactly a brotherhood of congeniality.  In 
actual fact, rival reporters find it easy to build up an abiding 
dislike for one another, although they normally take great pains 
to hide their animosities from outsiders.  But in spite of their 
differences, there is one time when all media representatives will 
lay their dislikes aside and join forces, place their wagons in a 
circle, and stand shoulder to shoulder fighting as one.  That 
occasion is whenever they perceive a threat to the freedom of the 
press and their right to publish or broadcast whatever they 
choose."

The ongoing Groom Lake conflict has turned into a classic example 
of how not to respond to the press.  We were especially surprised 
and amused to see the authorities seize the video tapes of yet 
another TV crew, KNBC of Los Angeles (DR#12).  The Secret Police 
never learn!  Nothing guarantees that your story will get top play 
in the evening newscast like trying in some way to suppress it.  
Even returning the confiscated tape won't end the story.  Instead 
of making the reporter quake in his boots, such an encounter 
almost assures his eternal devotion to the story.  Every reporter 
is quick to express his outrage at any such obstruction, but you 
know, deep down, that this is just the sort of challenge he lives 
for.

At last report, the video tape seized on July 19 has still not 
been returned.  Of the five tapes taken by force and without a 
warrant, the Air Force is prepared to release only one.  The rest, 
evidently, are a threat to national security.  The crew says they 
did not photograph the unacknowledged Groom Lake base, since they 
did not want to provoke the authorities, and there was already 
plenty of stock footage available.  They used only a wide angle 
lens, pointed away from the base, to interview activist Campbell 
on Freedom Ridge, in plain sight of the anonymous guards.  
Unfortunately, a wide angle lens means that some area of empty 
military land adjoining the border is bound to appear somewhere in 
the frame.  Everyone in the class knows about those anal-retentive 
OSI guys (Office of Special Investigations) who adhere without 
question to their given rules no matter how objectively absurd.  
If a photo was taken in downtown Las Vegas and happened to show 
restricted mountains in the background, that film has to be 
impounded and stamped "Top Secret," even if no detail is shown, no 
installations are visible and 10,000 better pictures are already 
in circulation.

Lawyers from the NBC network are said to be pursuing the matter, 
but the absence of the video tapes has not prevented the show from 
going on.  KNBC will supposedly run a story on Groom tonight (8/1, 
5:00pm, L.A. ch. 4.  Maybe also sat.K2/tr.3).  They do have choice 
shots of activist Campbell being hauled away in handcuffs after he 
tried to interfere with the seizure, and the rest of the story can 
be adequately reconstructed using footage taken by other stations.

Seeing the AF humiliate itself in front of yet another TV network, 
we are reminded of the poor stooge in the vaudeville act who 
always falls for the same gag again and again--the banana peel on 
the floor, the pie in the face.  After the laughter dies down, we 
feel only sadness.  The military's wisdom and flexibility in 
dealing with domestic opponents are a reflection on how it will 
respond to the rapidly changing enemy it is bound to face in the 
future.  The threats of the tomorrow will not be ponderous Soviets 
or ego-bound Saddams.  They are going to be swift-moving, 
opportunistic terrorist groups resembling more sophisticated 
versions of the Sons and Daughters of Liberty and not unlike 
Psychospy himself.  Having superior weaponry does not count as 
much as having some subtlety and brains and a leadership that is 
responsive enough to recognize a problem at its early stages and 
deal with it decisively before it becomes intractable.

 ----- PROTECTING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION -----

To future students of military public relations, the Groom Lake 
debacle of the mid-1990s will serve as a textbook example of how 
not to preserve classified information.  The old Cold War strategy 
for protecting a sensitive program was to classify EVERYTHING 
associated with it, including its funding, the fact of its 
existence and anything nominally trivial which might imply such a 
project.  Public relations, in those days, consisted only of 
various forms of "no comment," enhanced by patriotic sermons about 
those who died in previous wars.  If you acknowledged even the 
most tactically useless information, the theory went, it would 
start the ball rolling and soon the whole program would be 
compromised.

What was not recognized is that in attempting to classify every 
nut and bolt, every meal served in the commissary and every 
trivial fact the rest of the world knew already, the entire 
security apparatus became devalued and unenforceable.  The very 
reason the public was attracted to Groom was its surreal 
nonexistence.  Properly classified information was lumped together 
with the top-secret bar, tennis courts, prime rib dinners and 
decades of accumulated failures and abuses that were of no value 
to any foreign enemy.  When the trash finally got thrown out, 
unfortunately so did some valuable resources.

In the end, what broke the base was not Campbell and the TV crews, 
but the disenchantment of its own workers.  The key to keeping 
secrets, it was found, was not rules and enforcement but trust and 
cooperation.  Once the workers lost their faith that the 
government was on their side, and once they felt, rightly or 
wrongly, that their secrecy oath was working more against the 
interests of the country than for it, then no amount of threats, 
sermons or OSI thugs could keep them from speaking out about what 
they felt was wrong.  For a time, it was easy to bury 
embarassments and human problems under the claim of national 
security, but all those skeletons accumulated in the closet, and 
when the door was opened just a crack, they fell out all at once.

 ----- FREEDOM RIDGE CLOSURE LOOMS ----

It now looks increasingly likely that Freedom Ridge and White 
Sides will be closed to the public sometime in October.  There is 
still opportunity for comments, protests and appeals, and it is 
remotely possible that BLM could turn down or delay the AF 
request.  Realistically, though, visitors should not plan on these 
near-in viewpoints remaining open past October 15.

There will be a 30 day "protest" period between an affirmative BLM 
decision and the actual closing of the land, and we will certainly 
report this warning in the Rat.  Of course, we'll schedule a party 
at the very end and make sure the world doesn't overlook the 
passage.

Through Aug. 26, the BLM is offering the public the opportunity to 
comment on the transfer of the land from the Caliente Management 
Plan to the Nellis Range Management Plan--an obscure bureaucratic 
step in the withdrawal.  Acting District Manager Gary Ryan says 
that since most people do not understand how this comment period 
differs from the previous one, he will continue to accept comments 
on the withdrawal itself.   If you so choose, you can send your 
harangues to him at:

  Gary Ryan, Acting District Manager
  Bureau of Land Management
  P.O. Box 26569
  Las Vegas, Nevada  89126

It seems to us, though, that almost everything worthwhile has 
already been said.  Recently, we had a chance to examine the 
application case file packed with clippings, transcripts, back 
issues of the Rat, hundreds letters of protest and even a couple 
letters of AF support.  The file is almost a foot high now--a 
fascinating cultural and anthropological record that captures a 
slice of our human history.  The vast majority of the comments are 
wonderfully, magically irrelevant to the withdrawal process and 
entirely beyond the scope of BLM's mandate.  There are eloquent 
warnings about the dangers of government secrecy and impassioned 
pleas on behalf of the captive aliens.  Angry demands written in 
pseudo-legalese assert that the AF and BLM have no authority in 
Nevada to begin with and that everything must be given back to the 
state or the Indians.  Throughout the file, we are impressed by 
the passion and patriotism of the authors.  Clearly, this 
withdrawal has touched a public nerve, but unfortunately most of 
the vented emotion does not have much bearing on the land transfer 
process.

If the withdrawal is delayed or derailed, it will be on obscure 
procedural grounds.  Should an Environmental Impact Statement have 
been required instead of an Environmental Assessment?  Were the 
application requirements outlined in federal regulations properly 
followed?  The BLM district office does not have the facilities to 
evaluate UFO claims, social priorities or defense policies.  It 
can only process the application according to defined 
environmental and land-use procedures, then pass it upstairs to 
the State Director in Reno.  He, in turn, will probably refer it 
to the secretarial level in Washington, and there the final 
decision could be made by voodoo and sorcery, by studying the 
entrails of sacrificed animals and maybe not looking at the case 
file at all.

Sometime before the close of the comment period, Psychospy will 
make our own final argument against the withdrawal, which we will 
print in the Rat.  BLM expects to issue a decision about 2-3 weeks 
later, or mid-September.  If the withdrawal is supported, there 
will then be a 30-day protest period before the land is closed.  
This is the "last call" to visit Freedom Ridge.  After the land is 
closed, the decision can still be appealed.

If the withdrawal goes through, it is hard to call this a 
"victory" for the AF.  The application itself created a powerful 
opposition movement that won't go away when Freedom Ridge is 
taken.  In a way, the loss of the land may be the best thing that 
could happen to the movement, because it shifts the debate to a 
higher political and philosophic level.  

And remember the punch line:  The Groom Lake base can still be 
seen from several mountains that are higher and further back.  
tmahood@netcom.com and spouse have surveyed a trail to the top of 
the Tikaboo Peak viewpoint, 13 miles east of F.R.  His concise 
"Tikaboo Peak Guide" is included in the current edition (2.04) of 
the "Area 51 Viewer's Guide."  (Owners of previous editions can 
send us an SASE for a free Tikaboo Guide.)  When F.R. is closed, 
we expect to publish edition 3.0 of the Viewer's Guide, with new 
advice and viewpoints.

 ----- PROPOSED OUTING -----

We will organize a final camp-out and End-of-the-World get-
together on F.R. when we learn the date of its closure.  In the 
meantime, many people have expressed an interest in holding 
another gathering before the end of the summer.

We propose that this summer event be called the FREEDOM 
RIDGE/TIKABOO PEAK FREE-SPEECH ENCAMPMENT, with the nominal 
purpose of loudly protesting the NBC tape seizure but the real aim 
of having a good time.  We suggest that this event could be held 
either Labor Day weekend (Sept. 3-5) or the weekend before (Aug. 
27-28).  Saturday night could be spent around the campfire at 
Freedom Ridge, while on Sunday interested hikers could head to 
Tikaboo Peak for the official grand opening of the Summit Trail.  
(That hike is a strenuous 1-1/2 hours each way through forested 
alpine terrain from Badger Spring, accessible by dirt roads from 
US-93.)

The protest part of the outing (merely an idea at this point) is 
to suggest that everyone who objects to warrantless film and video 
seizures bring a camera of their own.  Cameras can either be real 
or convincing fake ones, and it is not necessary that they be 
loaded with film.  In addition, illegal photos of the base, as 
published by the Russians and in major periodicals, would be both 
sold and given away among participants.  Imagine 50 or 100 people 
with "cameras" all pointed at the base.  The Sheriff would be 
informed (He gets the Rat.) and would be invited to investigate 
and haul away as many of the perpetrators as he could.  
(Unfortunately, the Sheriff's Dept. no longer occupies the now-
abandoned Detention Center and has capacity for only a handful of 
prisoners at the Court House.)  Fond memories would be evoked of 
"Peace Camp" and the anti-nuclear protests at Mercury in the 80s.

Of course, this is all merely a suggestion at this point--an idle 
dream that we set forward here for public comment.  Psychospy 
would never recommend, at least on his own, that people bring 
cameras to a Groom Lake viewpoint.  Any recommendation like this 
would have to be made by consensus of the White Sides Defense 
Committee.

Anyone with thoughts to offer can drop us a line.  Which weekend 
is best?  Should we or should we not bring "cameras"?  If we go 
ahead with the encampment, dates and details will be printed in 
the next Rat.

 ----- LAZAR TIMELINE RELEASED -----

"UFO mechanic" Bob Lazar, who claims to have reverse engineered 
alien spacecraft at Papoose Lake, also claims to have degrees from 
both MIT and Cal-Tech.  He explains the absence of any academic 
records by suggesting that the government has made them 
"disappear."  Lazar is a man without a past, the story goes, and 
not even his birth certificate can be found.  

It turns out now that no records could be found because no one has 
looked very hard.  By digging through the archives of county 
clerks and city recorders offices, our colleague 
tmahood@netcom.com and his internet buddies have assembled a 
wealth of public records on Lazar.  His birth certificate still 
has not been located (perhaps because this requires more 
information and his permission), but other records available to 
anyone show Lazar's marriages, real estate transactions, a 
bankruptcy, a pandering charge and the death of a spouse.  tmahood 
has condensed this information into a chronological timeline of 
Lazar's life, a 10-page document now circulating on the net.

For the sake of decency, Lazar's social security number and other 
current identifying data have been deleted from the timeline.  
Publishing the dates of Lazar's other lifetime events may also 
strike some people as an invasion of privacy, but Lazar's dramatic 
UFO claims and the known inconsistencies of his personal life beg 
a chronological analysis.  The timeline pretty much extinguishes 
the notion that Lazar earned any degree from MIT or Cal-Tech:  
There just wasn't enough time.  It seems certain he worked for Los 
Alamos Laboratories, as he claims, but it is still not clear in 
what capacity.  The rest of the timeline, while nailing down 
Lazar's general whereabouts, seems to raise more questions than it 
answers.  In one curious three-day period, Lazar appears to have 
been married to two different women until one of them committed 
suicide.  No autopsy was performed.  Lazar then married the other 
woman AGAIN a few months later, she using a different name.  Lazar 
was going through bankruptcy proceedings at the time, which may 
explain some of the strange maneuvers.

Many readers may call Lazar a fraud, but that doesn't answer much.  
His motivation remains unknown, and the man himself is still a 
fascinating cipher.  Needless to say, he has not approved this 
document and his cooperation was not sought.  Nonetheless, tmahood 
says that he is willing to conduct further research if Lazar can 
point out any specific errors in the document.  The timeline 
should be available at the FTP site below.  If you are unable to 
obtain it there, you may request it by email from 
tmahood@netcom.com.  The internet-impaired may obtain a hard copy 
from Psychospy for $2 (to cover copying and postage).

 ----- MYSTERIOUS LARRY KING STOPOVER -----

Here's fodder for your conspiracy theories.  According to an 
article in the July 27 Las Vegas Review-Journal...

   "An airliner carrying talk show host Larry King was running on 
empty when it made an emergency landing at Nellis Air Force Base.

   "[American Airlines] Flight 1374 from Dallas landed at the base 
runway about 1:50 pm Saturday because of 'critical fuel,' said Air 
Force Maj. George Sillia, a base spokesman....

   "All of the passengers -- except King, who received a military 
escort to the convention -- had to stay on the plane for about 90 
minutes, Sillia said."

As reported in the Washington Post (See DR#11), King will be doing 
a TV special on Area 51, broadcast live from Rachel on Oct. 1.  
("Has Larry King been reduced to this?")  Is it a coincidence that 
King's jet HAPPENS to be diverted to Nellis two months before the 
show?  Nellis manages at least the land surrounding Area 51, and 
Major Sillia is the man who journalists go to for an authoritative 
"no comment" about the base.  Nellis AFB is only ten miles from 
McCarran Airport, the plane's intended destination.  Strange it 
should be diverted here, isn't it?

What we want to know is, WHAT HAPPENED DURING THAT MILITARY 
ESCORT?  We are reminded of Eisenhower's mysterious "dental 
appointment," when he disappeared for a few hours and could have 
been engaged in some sort of extraterrestrial contact.  Was it 
really "critical fuel" that forced King's plane to land, or was 
this just an excuse to brief him on the alien presence?  Or maybe 
the military created this charade to replace him with a LARRY KING 
CLONE, identical to the talk show host in every way except that 
when Oct. 1 comes along, he'll follow the script of the ruling 
elite.

ANYTHING could have happened during that military escort, and only 
one thing is certain:  The plane's diversion to Nellis "couldn't 
possibly be coincidence."

 ----- INTEL BITTIES -----

CAMPBELL ARRAIGNMENT.  As reported in DR #12, Glenn Campbell's 
arraignment on obstruction charges will be held this Weds., Aug. 
3, at 1:30 pm in Alamo Justice Court.  An arraignment is a brief 
and usually uninteresting hearing in which formal charges are 
filed and a trial date set.  Campbell, like O.J. Simpson, is 
expected to plead "absolutely, 100 percent not guilty."  He has 
reserved comment on his defense until after the arraignment, but 
knowing Mr. Campbell we think he'll have fun.  The worst penalty 
is probably a fine, and being accused of a crime usually increases 
ones legal powers of investigation and advocacy.

TRESPASSER CASE LINGERS ON.  In DR #11, we reported that the case 
of the January trespassers had finally been resolved.  Not so.  
The equipment confiscated by the Cammo Dudes from their impounded 
cars has still not been returned:  binoculars, telescope and a 
camera (with no film).  We consider the delay yet another example 
of military P.R. bungling.  The equipment is of no value to AF and 
not returning it simply assures that this irritating case, like 
the little Energizer bunny, will keep on going and going and 
going...

"STUPID FAGGOT" VANISHES.  The graffiti on a remote Restricted 
Area sign reported in DR #11 ("Glenn Campbell is a stupid faggot 
and so are his loyal followers!") has disappeared as mysteriously 
as it came.  It looks like someone washed it off neatly with a 
spray cleaner without touching our "Misplaced Sign" marking or the 
big "X".  Did an officer read about it in the Rat, and pass down a 
clean-up order?  Did we got someone in trouble?  (Sorry, guys.)

HAT, BOOK AVAILABLE IN PENTAGON.  The Groom Lake patch has been 
selling like gangbusters at Fort America, the military memorabilia 
shop in the Outer Concourse at the Pentagon.  Now, two more of our 
products are available there: the Groom Lake hat and the Area 51 
Viewer's Guide.  We hope our local readers will check out the 
merchandise.  (Either that or suppress it, which would be far more 
newsworthy.)
