                  "@{b}AN INTERVIEW WITH DAVID WATMOUGH@{ub}"

                          @{i}by Vittorio Curtoni@{ui}


 Q: In the States, in Canada and in the UK you are a  well  known  and
 respected  writer.  Here  in Italy you have never been translated, so
 our Italian readers don't know a thing about you.  Would  you  please
 introduce yourself and your literary opus?

 A:  I am a 70 year-old gay author of four novels and seven volumes of
 short stories. I was born in London of Cornish parentage where I grew
 up. After graduation from King's College, London University I went to
 Paris to write my first book (on the priest-worker  movement  in  the
 Catholic  Church).  There,  in  1951, I met my California-born lover,
 Floyd, with whom I still live (and love!) some 46 years later!  Since
 Paris  we  have  lived  in New York and San Francisco before settling
 here in Vancouver in the early 1960's where we both  became  Canadian
 citizens.  It  is  in  this beautiful city under the mountains on the
 edge of the Pacific Ocean that I have written all my fiction which is
 centered  on  my  alter-ego  -  a character named Davey Bryant. It is
 couched in the First  Person  so  very  often  people  mistake  Davey
 Bryant,  the  protagonist,  with  David  Watmough the author. The two
 certainly  have  things  in  common  (nationality,  an  ongoing-love,
 gayness  etc)  so  the mistake is understandable. But it is not quite
 accurate, nevertheless!

 Q: So tell me something about Davey Bryant.

 A:  I  don't  know  the  correct  Italian   word   but   the   German
 "doppelganger" fairly sums up what I mean by the relationship between
 Davey and David. What I am trying  to  do  with  all  my  novels  and
 stories  is  to  compose  a fictional biographical portrait of a 20th
 century gay man. Jane Rule, the novelist, has described Davey  Bryant
 as  "the  Everyman  of  the  gay  world."  Writing  in  The  Canadian
 Encyclopedia, the critic Stanley Gordon  wrote  (rather  grandiosly!)
 about   me:  "Since  the  stories  are  written  as  a  mature  man's
 recollection of his past, and since they are intended to be  read  as
 parts  of  a  single,  extended  work,  comparisons  with  Proust are
 inevitable: as autobiographical writing they have  been  ranked  with
 that of Dylan Thomas."

 Q: You were born in England, have travelled all over the world, lived
 in various countries. Why did you choose to stay in Canada?

 A: Because it is so totally boring  it  doesn't  interefere  with  my
 literary creativity. Exciting countries I prefer funneled through the
 media so that I can switch them off. I was born  at  the  hub  of  an
 Emire  that  ruled  a  quarter of the earth - and fled it. I moved to
 that powerful Republic which inherited that power on  behalf  of  the
 English-speaking  Peoples  -  and  fled  it.  Now  I belong with just
 30,000,00 fellow citizens in an empty landscape  composed  mainly  of
 tundra  and  rock who immerse themselves in nonsense like ice hockey,
 speak in grunts and are generally ignored by the rest of  the  world.
 In other words, for the solitary author - perfection!

 Q:  Do you think that the world has really changed its points of view
 (or  better,  its  bias)  on  homosexuality?  What's  your   personal
 experience?

 A:  My longterm experience, plus my optimistic temperament suggests I
 say that for middleclass,urban dwellers in the First World things are
 certainly  better  than  when  I  was sent to jail! Many European and
 North American places have more liberal legislation  -  at  least  in
 some  degree.  But to be blind to ongoing injustice, persecution, and
 blackmail by fear of losing a job or promotion means wearing blinkers
 and  inhabiting  a  fool's paradise. For me as an "out" author living
 with a university professor, the gay label hasn't been a  heavy  one.
 But I am very aware that the same cannot be said for a gay policeman,
 a gay bank clerk, and a thousand other jobs that the majority of gays
 have.  No,  the struggle is not yet over but there is still reason to
 say thanks.

 Q: How do you treat your homosexuality as a literary theme?

 A: We have a saying in North America: Q. How does  a  porcupine  make
 love?  A.  VERY carefully! It is so with my utilization of my gayness
 in my art. It is there as a  basic  constituent  -  like  hair-color,
 gender,  weight  or  nationality.  But  I prefer the description of a
 fiction writer who happens to be gay rather than "gay writer" because
 my  literary,  spiritual,  and  emotional  horizons  extend beyond my
 loins. And I should hasten to say they did when I was twenty so  it's
 not just a matter of getting old! On the other hand, I am proud of my
 gayness, have never denied it since I was arrested and imprisoned  in
 wartime   Britain   for   importuning  in  a  public  toilet  when  a
 seventeen-year-old sailor. It becomes a viable theme for me, I think,
 when  I  use  the  fact  of  gay marginalization as an opportunity of
 looking at the rest of the world. As  cricket  spectators  say:"  The
 onlooker  sees  most of the game." I also think my gayness relates me
 to women in a special way and that  is  reflected  in  my  fiction  -
 especially  my  most  recent volumes. Certainly I receive a number of
 fan-letters from straight women to whom I seem to speak directly.

 Q: HUNTING WITH DIANA, your recent, splendid collection  is  made  of
 stories  that tell of your electronic encounters on Internet. Why did
 you choose this particular theme?

 A: I chose this theme  because  I  wanted  to  highlight  the  latest
 technology  in  the  context of the most ancient of western myths and
 legends. All against the backdrop of a  dying  twentieth  century.  I
 also  wanted  to  have a dig at the moral complacency, witch-hunting,
 and puerile sense of history that characterises too much  of  today's
 thinking  and  which is aided and abetted (in North America at least)
 by the crappiest level of TV etc. I also simply wanted to fulfill  my
 vocation as a story-teller. I LOVE writing stories!

 Q: HUNTING WITH DIANA is a book full of dark, black stories: suicide,
 homicide,  incest,  mutilation...  At  times  I   was   reminded   of
 Shakespeare's  most tragic works. Was I right? And why did you choose
 this particular approach? Is this your view of today world?

 A: Yes, you are dead on! I believe that Shakespeare, and the  Ancient
 Greeks  (  and  Latins!)  before  him  are  just as relevant today as
 before. I do not think that man evolves morally. He is as selfish, as
 craven as jealous, as fearful today in a Turin apartment as he was in
 yesterday`s cave in southwestern France! Morality is  not  a  fashion
 fad  like  food  or  clothes  but  an  integral  part  of  the  human
 composition and the source of both his/her  splendeur  et  misere.  I
 think  behind  all novelists, fiction writers, is a lurking historian
 who wants to put the record right and hand down to unborn generations
 a  composite  picture  of  blacks,  whites and (above all) grays - in
 other  words,  how  the  world  really   is   and   NOT   the   trite
 simplifications  dolled  out  by  the media. For gays this means, for
 instance,  to  preserve  a  proper  distinction  between  enjoying  a
 teen-age  lover  as  the  Greeks  most  certainly  did  and pedophile
 molesters of vulnerable little children who deserve the protection of
 us all.

 Q:  Your  use  of  the classical myths in HUNTING WITH DIANA is quite
 explicit and very clearly elucidated  in  your  final  notes  to  the
 stories.  You  refer  to a world that possessed, in its mythology and
 also often in  its  everyday  behaviours,  a  much  more  common  and
 tolerated,  when  not  encouraged,  quantity  of  what  today we call
 "deviant behaviour". Why this change in the course of the  centuries?
 Was  it  just  the  advent  of  Christianity?  Or  is this concept of
 "deviancy" a by-product of the so called modern civilization? Why  do
 we  today consider deviant what in a less technologized, more natural
 world was considered normal?

 A: All human  mores  down  through  the  ages  are  relative  to  the
 orthodoxies  of  the  time. In Medieval England half the clergy lived
 with  concubines.  The  ratio  has  remained  roughly  so  AFTER  the
 reformation and down to current time -only now they are called clergy
 wives! You simply cannot "judge" particular ages  but  you  can  have
 favorite  ones. Mine was probably the late Eleventh Century and early
 Twelfth when there seemed to be a lot of edifying  vision  about  and
 more  Idealism  than  I  find  currently observable. But chacun a son
 gout...

 Q: I have recently translated a rather amusing novel (a noir)  by  an
 American  writer,  Joe  Lansdale,  MUCHO  MOJO.  One  of his two main
 characters is a black gay. In a scene  halfway  between  tragedy  and
 black humor, a priest throws sodomy in the face of the black gay, and
 the black gay  throws  in  the  priest's  face  some  of  God's  more
 debatable  (or  less  intelligible,  if you prefer) doings in the Old
 Testament. The priest simply replies by saying that  God's  acts  are
 not always, can't always be intelligible to man. This seems to me the
 most classical and annoying behaviour of the Catholic Church. What do
 you  think  of  the current positions of the Church on homosexuality?
 And of its positions on sexuality in general?

 A: The Church has always been rather duplicitous  in  the  matter  of
 sexuality.  Due  in part to the Manicheean aspect i.e. that sexuality
 is, per se, evil that permeates Pauline theology. (It was G.B.  Shaw,
 I   think,  who  suggested  that  St.Paul  turned  Christianity  into
 Crosstianity.) and distorts the teachings of a) St. Augustine and  b)
 St.  Thomas  Acquinas. The opposing factor, the teachings of St. John
 in both the Fourth Gospel and the  Joahannine  Epistle  is  crucially
 under-played  and  causes the current heresy in Catholic (and extreme
 Protestant) dogma. 90% of "Pulpit Teaching" by the Church  is  vested
 in  ignorance.  Jesus  Christ  NEVER  condemned homosexuality. Nor is
 there a verse in the New Testament about the subject,  per  se.  Why?
 Simply  because  the Ancients had never heard the word! (It is, after
 all a bastard compilation with a  quasi  Greek  prefix  and  a  Latin
 suffix.)  The  contemporary  Church  is accustomed to a schizophrenic
 theology wherever and whenever sex is involved. It  tells  the  local
 Faithful  that  God  through  his  Polish  Rep believes that Catholic
 priests should be celibate but  NEVER  adds  that  is  only  a  local
 Western  discipline. The Eastern Uniate Christians who believe in the
 Pope as Vicar of Christ but follow the  Eastern  style  Liturgy  have
 ALWAYS  had  a married priesthood and still do. Also Anglican married
 priests who become RC priests do not have  to  divorce,  imprison  or
 slay  their  wives.  It is this kind of double behavior that puts off
 thinking folk.

 Q: By the way, do you believe in  God?  What  is  your  philosophical
 position about the universe and the meaning of life?

 A.  Yes,  I  suppose I believe in God as the Life-Force that animates
 the fabric of life from the  simple  cell  to  the  most  complicated
 organism.  But anything that betrays the Divine impulse in Mankind to
 scientifically comprehend and aesthetically appreciate living life on
 this  planet  -  and  perhaps others - earns my undying opposition. I
 have come a fair way from the days when I was a student  of  theology
 at  London  University  and  author of A Church Renascent and some of
 that journey has been painful. Is painful. I  shall  be  at  Mass  on
 Easter  Day  but  tears  will  blind  me from what is going on at the
 altar. Why not call me an Anglo-Catholic Agnostic - unable at present
 to suspend disbelief?

 Q:  You  often told me that you consider humor an essential component
 of your work. I completely agree with you. Life without  humor  would
 be the most dry of deserts. At the same time, I nourish a strong love
 and respect for completely tragic novels like LA NAUSEE by Sartre  or
 LA PESTE by Camus, or movies like THE SILENCE by Ingmar Bergman. Am I
 schizofrenic, or is it normal for the human  nature  to  be  able  to
 enjoy  both  opposites?  And  why, in your opinion, even really great
 artists choose to express themselves, at least at  times,  completely
 without humor?

 A: All artists should be in the position to say with the 18th century
 English Methodist preacher, John Wesley, "The world  is  my  parish!"
 Nothing,  but  NOTHING,  lies  outside  the  novelist's purview - and
 humor, as much as tears, life and death, hedonism and asceticism  are
 all  potential gold in the motherlode of an artist's craft to be used
 in the implementation of his/her  vision.  On  the  other  hand,  one
 doesn't  HAVE  to  write  about this or that. I get rather tired when
 (mostly young but not all) gay writers feel  they  MUST  write  about
 their  sexual  Rites of Passage - what in English gay lingo is called
 "coming out". I think it might be more interesting if  they  were  to
 chose  to  write  about  something like their early reactions to such
 things as a bull's balls or ads for underwear  in  magzines  designed
 for  youngsters.  Personally,  I don't like exclusively "jokey" books
 but then I would look askance at a meal comprised solely of salad  or
 bread!

 Q:  Your  love  of  Italian  opera and your hate of Italian pasta are
 resounding themes in the contemporary  literary  world.  How  do  you
 defend yourself from these infamous accusations?

 A:  I  love opera because my opera-critic roommate would sling me out
 if I didn't. And I hate pasta because my pasta-loving roommate adores
 it  and  I  need  a  little space in our relationship after forty-six
 years of his cooking for me! All great love  affairs,  you  see,  are
 based  on  a  bit  of  prudence  and  a  little naughtiness. And I am
 privileged to enjoy one of the greatest.

 Thank you David! You're a very wise man!

 E' giusto secondo voi  utilizzare  un  mezzo  di  comunicazione  come
 INTERNET  per parlare delle attivita' del proprio vicino di casa? Non
 c'e' il grave rischio di sentirsi rispondere dai quattro  continenti,
 problemi di lingua a parte, un bel MAANOICHECCEFREGA!!!! ?

 Puo'  darsi,  anzi  probabilmente si', pero' e' proprio questo che mi
 affascina della rete: il lontano puo' divenire vicino  ed  il  vicino
 lontano  (e  non  intendo  ovviamente  il  "vicino"  di  casa,  pero'
 pensandoci bene  ho  scambiato  sicuramente  molte  piu'  parole  con
 ragazzi  distanti migliaia di Km che non con quasi tutti i miei reali
 vicini di casa, e sono sicuro che anche per molti di voi la  cosa  e'
 vera);  il  grande puo' diventare piccolo e viceversa (ci pensate che
 dopotutto Dada ha le stesse possibilita', dal punto di vista tecnico,
 di essere visibile a tutti quante ne ha che so Microsoft o Mtv)?

 Per  tutti  questi motivi, ben sapendo che la cosa freghera' a pochi,
 mi va di sfidare la vastita' della rete per proporvi un mio  articolo
 su due rock band della mia citta' che, secondo il mio modesto parere,
 meritano forse  di  piu'  di  tanti  altri  gruppi  rock  molto  piu'
 blasonati. Suonare in una piccola citta' come Piacenza significa gia'
 di per se' partire  con  un  piede  sbagliato,  o  perlomeno  un  po'
 sfigato,  ecco  dunque  venire in soccorso di questi baldi giovani LA
 RETE. Anche loro potranno dire di essere su INTERNET come  gli  U2  o
 gli OASIS.

 Assurdo, ma affascinante non vi pare?



 "@{i}ROCK BAND A PIACENZA@{ui}:

 @{b}PERLA MADRE E SAGRADA FAMILIA@{ub}"


 Antefatto 1: Aprile 1996, un ragazzo un po'  troppo  sicuro  di  se',
 almeno  per i miei gusti, mi chiede di fare suonare il suo gruppo nel
 locale che gestivo insieme ad  alcuni  amici.  "Che  tipo  di  musica
 facciamo?"  sorride alla mia domanda scontata "la migliore che ci sia
 in giro, ovvio".  Il  gruppo  si  chiama  "Perla  Madre".  Li  faccio
 suonare,  perche' nonostante tutto hanno la faccia simpatica e... beh
 quel tipo aveva ragione: era la migliore musica che avessi sentito in
 giro da un po' di tempo a questa parte.

 Antefatto 2: Settembre 1996 (verso la meta'), vago per la casa con la
 mente intorpidita da una fastidiosa influenza  di  fine  estate.  Dal
 viale  di  fronte  la  mia  finestra proviene una musica valzereccia,
 sottofondo immancabile di ogni festival politico estivo. Ad un tratto
 una  melodia di una bellezza quasi dimenticata, mista ad una ripetuta
 serie di applausi, mi costringe ad uscire  di  casa  per  cercare  di
 capire se le troppe aspirine prese stanno avendo effetti strani su di
 me oppure no. Fortunatamente non sono impazzito: sono solo i "Sagrada
 Familia" in concerto.

 Tutto questo noioso prologo solo per spiegare come e' avvenuto il mio
 incontro con due delle piu' promettenti band piacentine degli  ultimi
 anni. "A Piacenza si suona, si suona grazie a Dio" mi disse un giorno
 uno dei nostri "guru rock" Tony Face mostrandomi la sua  nuova  Volvo
 Familiare  fiammante.  E,  battute  a  parte, credo che grande merito
 della vivacita' della nostra scena musicale  vada  anche  ai  ragazzi
 dell'Audiar   (Tony,   Federico,  Giancarlo,  ecc...)  che  non  solo
 consentono alle nostre band di confezionare opere di ottima  qualita'
 dal  punto  di  vista  sonoro,  ma  si  sbattono  anche parecchio per
 organizzare manifestazioni come "Tendenze" che da un  paio  d'anni  a
 questa  parte  e'  il trampolino di lancio di tantissime giovani band
 piacentine.

 Ma torniamo alle nostre due band. Da mesi  attendevo  con  impazienza
 l'uscita  del CD dei "Perla Madre" ed ora finalmente e' uscito. Avevo
 gia'  avuto  la  possibilita'  di  ascoltare  il  master  delle  loro
 registrazioni  e  gia' da quello si capiva che ci trovavamo di fronte
 ad un ottimo esordio. Sei pezzi  (piu'  uno  acustico  non  segnalato
 sulle  note  del CD) di puro "rock alla cera d'api" (va beh questa e'
 una vaccata che amano dire loro). Per me si  tratta  solo  di  ottimo
 rock  che  passa da melodie accattivanti, e perche' nasconderlo anche
 all'insegna del migliore  pop-rock,  come  nel  caso  di  "Sonica"  e
 "Variabile"  a  pezzi  "piu' cattivi" come "Spleen" o "Inverno" con i
 suoi  riff  lisergici  a,  per  finire,  ballate   come   "A.F.T"   e
 "Sensibilizzami"  che  non stonerebbero in mezzo ai migliori pezzi di
 gruppi rock  italiani  piu'  blasonati  come  "Afterhours"  o  "Ritmo
 Tribale".  Ultima  nota  per  i  testi  decisamente al di sopra delle
 solite  banalita'  di  tanti  gruppi  che  non  danno  alle   liriche
 l'importanza adeguata.

 Se  i  "Perla Madre" rivolgono il loro sguardo compositivo gia' verso
 il 2000, discorso diverso occorre  fare  per  gli  altrettanto  bravi
 "Sagrada  Familia"  che invece ci riportano indietro negli anni ad un
 certo tipo di rock americano che ha attraversato in punta di piedi la
 musica  degli  ultimi  30 anni e che si puo' far risalire ai migliori
 "Simon and Garfunkel" (e  chi  pensa  che  le  loro  melodie  fossero
 canzoncine  leggere  si sbaglia di brutto o non sa leggere l'inglese)
 fino ad arrivare a quella scena denominata "Paisley Underground"  che
 ci  faceva  sognare  a  meta'  degli  anni  '80 con gruppi come "Rain
 Parade",  "True  West",  "Green  On  Red"  o  i  grandissimi   "Dream
 Syndicate"  che  sembrano avere ispirato da molto vicino alcune delle
 canzoni presenti in "Recycled", il CD uscito appunto qualche mese  fa
 dei  "Sagrada".  "Reciclati",  forse,  ma  la  loro operazione non e'
 sicuramente una pedissequa imitazione di modelli del passato,  ma  un
 vero  e  proprio,  e  soprattutto  sincero,  qualita'  che manca alla
 stragrande  maggioranza  dei  musicisti  di  oggi  sempre  pronti   a
 cavalcare  la moda di turno, omaggio ad una musica ancora in grado di
 suscitare emozioni e scuotere la nostra anima e non  solo  il  nostro
 cervello  o, concedetemelo, il nostro uccello. Ascoltate dunque pezzi
 come "White Train", "Surpise!" o "Belfast Grrl",  tanto  per  citarne
 solo alcuni dei 13 che conpongono il CD, e ritroverete l'altra faccia
 (quella vera?)  del  rock  in  contrapposizione  a  quello  urlato  e
 trasgressivo (mah!) di fasulle band propinateci da MTV e radio varie.

 L'anno  nuovo  inizia,  quindi,  nel migliore dei modi per il rock di
 casa nostra (e si attendono a breve il nuovo dei "Wicked Minds" e dei
 "Supereroi")   con  due  opere  che  non  sfigureranno  nella  vostra
 collezione musicale (i loro CD li potete trovare nei migliori  negozi
 di musica di Piacenza).

           "@{b}PHILIP DICK: IN LOTTA CON L'UNIVERSO IMPAZZITO@{ub}"

                          @{i}by Vittorio Curtoni@{ui}


       Nato a Chicago nel 1928 e morto nel 1982, Philip  Kindred
    Dick   e'  stato  (e  rimane)  un  autore  fondamentale  per
    l'evoluzione della fantascienza.  Il  giudizio che di lui ha
    dato una delle piu' prestigiose scrittrici americane, Ursula
    Le  Guin,  riassume  con  sintetica  efficacia   il   valore
    rivoluzionario  dell'opera  di Dick: "Nessuno si accorge che
    abbiamo qui in America  un  nostro  Borges,  e lo abbiamo da
    trent'anni."

       Dopo avere lavorato come commesso nel reparto  di  musica
    classica di un negozio di dischi ed essere stato disc-jockey
    (sempre per la musica classica) di una stazione radiofonica,
    Dick  esordisce come scrittore di racconti nel 1952.  Il suo
    primo romanzo, "Il disco  di  fiamma",  esce nel 1955, e pur
    essendo  chiaramente  influenzato  dagli  stereotipi   della
    fantascienza avventurosa dell'epoca, svela gia' un interesse
    del tutto particolare per i meccanismi della casualita', che
    in  un  ipotetico  futuro  diventano  la chiave in base alla
    quale si decidono  le  sorti  politiche  del nostro pianeta.
    Molto piu' personale e affascinante e' un romanzo del  1957,
    "L'occhio  nel  cielo",  dove si comincia a delinare il tema
    della frantumazione del  reale:  ognuno  dei personaggi che,
    per un incidente, vengono investiti da un  fascio  protonico
    da  sei  miliardi  di volt crea un proprio mondo soggettivo,
    modellato  sulle  sue  nevrosi.   Ovviamente,  si  tratta di
    universi da incubo, in cui non esistono piu' freni inibitori
    e nessuna barriera tra il raziocinio cosciente e le pulsioni
    dell'inconscio.

       Tra gli anni Cinquanta  e  i  Sessanta,  ormai  diventato
    autore   professionista,  Dick  pubblica  a  getto  continuo
    romanzi  e  racconti,  rivelandosi   uno  dei  talenti  piu'
    prolifici  che  la  science  fiction  abbia  mai  avuto.   A
    differenza di tanti suoi colleghi, pero', Dick riesce sempre
    a mantenersi su  livelli  di  eccellente  qualita',  sicche'
    anche le sue opere minori sono al di sopra della media, e le
    opere   maggiori   costituiscono   un'imponente   serie   di
    capolavori.   La  consacrazione ufficiale del suo talento e'
    il premio Hugo che  viene  assegnato a uno splendido romanzo
    del  1962,  "La  svastica  sul   sole",   classica   ucronia
    ambientata  in un universo parallelo dove le forze dell'Asse
    hanno  vinto  la   seconda   guerra   mondiale  e  l'America
    contemporanea e' una nazione sconfitta a  tutti  i  livelli.
    Nel   tessuto  narrativo  si  insinua  una  seconda  realta'
    alternativa, sotto le spoglie  di un romanzo di fantascienza
    che parla di un mondo in cui  l'Asse  ha  perso  la  guerra;
    pero'  l'assetto  socio-politico  che  ne  e'  risultato  e'
    piuttosto diverso da quello del nostro universo...

       Il 1964 e'  un  anno  particolarmente  significativo  per
    Dick.  "I simulacri" e "Le tre stimmate di Palmer Eldritch",
    due  pietre miliari della sua produzione, introducono temi e
    spunti  che  resteranno  tipici  della  sua  arte  fino agli
    ultimissimi romanzi.  Nel primo libro compaiono le  creature
    artificiali  cui  allude  il  titolo,  i simulacri, androidi
    perfezionatissimi che il  potere  (la  classe dei G, l'elite
    dominante)  usa  per  mantenere  nella  piu'  totale   delle
    soggezioni   il  resto  dell'umanita'  (la  classe  dei  B).
    Riprendendo una profetica intuizione  di George Orwell, Dick
    ipotizza che i G, per meglio esercitare la loro oppressione,
    riscrivano in continuazione i testi di storia che i  B  sono
    obbligati  a  studiare;  e,  spingendosi ancora piu' in la',
    prevede  addirittura  l'uso   del   viaggio  nel  tempo  per
    apportare modifiche concrete al passato storico.  Come  gia'
    in   "La  svastica  sul  sole",  l'analisi  delle  strutture
    politiche  e'  spietata,  lucidamente  amara,  e  non lascia
    speranze: il potere, cristallizzato in vere e proprie caste,
    tende a perpetuarsi all'infinito, mentendo su  tutto,  sulla
    vita come sulla morte, come sulla realta' stessa.

       "Le  tre  stimmate  di  Palmer  Eldritch"  puo',  a  buon
    diritto, essere considerato un  libro epocale, nel senso che
    rappresenta e interpreta le  tensioni  ideali  di  un'intera
    fascia  di  cultura  e  di  un  preciso  periodo storico: la
    cultura della  droga,  che  ha  avuto  molti  profeti, molti
    teorici,  e  molti  devoti   praticanti,   all'interno   dei
    movimenti  giovanili  di contestazione.  La lotta fra le due
    corporazioni che  si  contendono  il  predominio del mercato
    interplanetario della droga (usata come panacea al "male  di
    vivere"  dei  coloni  sbattuti  su  mondi ostili) porta a un
    crescendo di  allucinata  confusione  ontologica;  il  qui e
    l'ora,  la  concretezza  del  reale,  non   esistono   piu',
    sostituiti  da  un caos di percezioni alterate e di stati di
    coscienza "acidi".  Il Dio  che  si delinea in queste pagine
    possiede una natura fondamentalmente maligna, e la figura di
    Palmer Eldritch (che si moltiplica  all'infinito,  apparendo
    ovunque,  sfiorando  tutto  con la sua presenza) ha spiccati
    sottofondi  messianici.   La  ricerca  del  trascendente, il
    tentativo di definire l'essere superiore che regge  le  fila
    del  destino  umano, e' un'altra costante della narrativa di
    Dick.   Col  tempo,  tendera'  a  portarlo  a  un misticismo
    radicale dagli esiti narrativi assai bizzarri (e' il caso di
    "Divina invasione", un  romanzo  del  1981,  e  di  "Valis",
    apparso nello stesso anno); ma la sincerita' del suo anelito
    e'  fuori  discussione,  e  in  "Le tre stimmate..." il tema
    religioso aggiunge echi molto  suggestivi a una vicenda gia'
    ricca di affascinanti risvolti onirici.

       A  proposito della droga, va precisato che Dick stesso ne
    ha  fatto  uso,  per  quanto  in  epoche  successive  si sia
    affrettato a smentirlo, e per quanto alcune delle sue  opere
    piu' tarde ("Episodio temporale", 1974; "Scrutare nel buio",
    1976) siano drammatici, convincenti atti d'accusa contro gli
    allucinogeni.    Come  tanti  altri  artisti  della  cultura
    popolare degli anni Sessanta  (valga per tutti l'esempio dei
    Beatles), Dick ha cercato nella droga motivi di ispirazione,
    visioni  che  fossero  slegate  dalla  percezione   normale,
    piatta,  del  mondo;  e se e' lecito giudicare dai risultati
    senza perdersi in troppo  facili  moralismi,  va detto che i
    suoi sforzi sono stati tutt'altro che inutili.   Le  geniali
    allucinazioni  di cui si nutrono romanzi come "Il cacciatore
    di  androidi"  (1968),  dal  quale  Ridley  Scott  trasse il
    celebre film "Blade Runner", o "Ubik,  mio  signore"  (1969)
    non  sarebbero  forse  mai  nate da una mente che non avesse
    provato l'ebbrezza dello stato alterato di coscienza indotto
    dagli psicofarmaci  assunti  in  dosi  massicce.  Queste due
    opere portano alle conseguenze piu' estreme il  processo  di
    sfaldamento  del  reale:  gli androidi che Rick Deckard deve
    individuare ed eliminare sono,  per  certi versi, piu' umani
    degli  uomini  che  li  hanno  creati,  tanto  che   diventa
    praticamente impossibile riuscire a distinguere fra l'essere
    artificiale e l'essere vero, biologico; e Ubik, l'enigmatica
    presenza  che  si  materializza  sotto  infinite spoglie, e'
    l'ente  superiore  ma   allo   stesso   tempo  e'  anche  un
    banalissimo spray per uso domestico, e in  ogni  caso,  come
    annuncia  la singolare rivelazione finale, buona parte della
    storia si e' svolta in un  mondo che non esiste, in un sogno
    creato da qualcuno che dovrebbe essere morto...

       Negli ultimi anni di vita, divenuto un  autore  di  culto
    anche  al di fuori della cerchia dei lettori di fantascienza
    (in particolare in Europa: Francia e Italia sono fra i paesi
    che piu' hanno amato la  sua narrativa), Dick si e' lanciato
    in veementi battaglie contro la droga.  Sempre piu' simile a
    tanti dei personaggi dei suoi romanzi, ha sostenuto dapprima
    di essere  perseguitato  dalla  CIA  per  le  sue  posizioni
    politiche radicali, e piu' tardi di essere stato invasato da
    Dio   stesso.    Dio   sarebbe   entrato  nella  sua  mente,
    fornendogli nuove  chiavi  interpretative  per l'esistenza e
    provvedendo, fra le altre cose, a rimettere ordine nel  caos
    della   sua  situazione  finanziaria.   Certo  e'  difficile
    giudicare le dichiarazioni di  cui  Dick e' stato tutt'altro
    che avaro in interviste e articoli e  che  sembrerebbero  in
    netta  opposizione  con la perenne lucidita' della sua opera
    letteraria.  Personalmente, pur avendo talora sospettato che
    questa  repentina  metamorfosi  fosse  solo  una  beffa,  un
    ironico scherzo giocato per  puro  divertimento da un grande
    tessitore di trame schizofreniche, resto senz'altro convinto
    dal tono predicatorio, aspramente biblico, di  romanzi  come
    "Divina  invasione" e "Valis", lontani miglia e miglia dalla
    fredda capacita' di analisi  dei  lavori precedenti.  Ma se,
    come Dick ha sempre  sostenuto,  la  realta'  ha  un  numero
    infinito  di  facce  che  si sovrappongono in continuazione,
    creando la semplice apparenza  di  un ordine, di una logica,
    allora  puo'  veramente  darsi  che   lo   scrittore   abbia
    incontrato a tu per tu una delle facce piu' segrete e ne sia
    rimasto  cambiato  per  il  poco  tempo  che  gli restava da
    vivere...

       Per amare bisogna anche odiare, o saper odiare: e' questo
    uno dei messaggi che  si ripetono con martellante intensita'
    nel  corpus  narrativo  di  Dick  (messaggio,  fra  l'altro,
    puntualmente confermato dai ritmi sincopati della  sua  vita
    sentimentale).    Nelle  relazioni  fra  uomo  e  donna  che
    l'autore americano ci  racconta  il  nucleo amore-odio e' la
    chiave essenziale.  Porta  a  capovolgimenti  di  ruolo,  al
    desiderio  di  infliggersi  dolore  a vicenda, a lacerazioni
    insanabili; sicche', alla fine delle  sue storie, e' un dato
    tipico che i protagonisti si ritrovino al punto di partenza,
    con le stesse incertezze e un  nuovo  ammasso  di  problemi,
    spesso  peggiori  di quelli iniziali, da risolvere.  Perche'
    il punto e' questo: nessuno  riesce mai ad avere un rapporto
    di  completo  amore  con  se  stesso,  e  quindi  non   puo'
    pretendere  di  averlo  col mondo esterno.  Antichi sensi di
    colpa,  ossessioni  che  ci   trasciniamo  dietro  da  anni,
    mineranno sempre la  nostra  pace  interiore,  e  la  nostra
    visione  del  mondo.   Essere schizofrenici (o ebefrenici, o
    quello che  meglio  vi  pare:  scegliete  la vostra malattia
    mentale preferita!) diventa una  sorta  di  necessita',  per
    poter  operare  un distacco fra l'io e l' altro dall'io, fra
    l'emotivita' e la logica, fra i problemi che forse ammettono
    una soluzione e le situazioni che non hanno via d'uscita.

       Tutti, o quasi, i  personaggi di Dick sono schizofrenici,
    nel senso che le loro  percezioni  tendono  a  scindersi  su
    livelli distinti, portando a un incessante lavoro di analisi
    che ha poco di razionale e molto di intuitivo.  Si tratta di
    un  meccanismo di difesa nei confronti di un universo folle,
    all'interno del quale  la  schizofrenia  e'  un dato di base
    ineliminabile; detto in parole povere,  siamo  alla  tattica
    del  combattere  il  nemico  sul  suo  stesso terreno, nella
    speranza non di  vincere  (illusione  assurda di fronte allo
    stato delle cose che ci circonda) ma, piu' semplicemente, di
    riuscire in qualche modo a sopravvivere.

       Schizofrenica e alienante e' la tecnologia: strumento  di
    repressione  nelle  mani del potere, si trasforma in tortura
    quotidiana,  spicciola  e  sfibrante,  nelle  lotte  con  le
    macchine che si rifiutano  di  funzionare come vorremmo noi,
    negli impianti audio che cominciano a trasmettere una musica
    che  non   puo'   esistere,   nelle   porte   (elettroniche,
    intelligenti)  che  non  accettano  di  aprirsi se prima non
    abbiamo  inserito   una   monetina   nell'apposita  fessura.
    Schizofrenica e' la realta', pronta  a  sfaldarsi  sotto  le
    nostre mani da un momento all'altro, a presentarci il quadro
    apparentemente  rassicurante  di  cose  e  persone  che sono
    tutt'altro da cio' che crediamo,  a illuderci con ricordi di
    un'esistenza che non ci e' mai  appartenuta.   Schizofrenico
    e'  il concetto stesso di vita, quando ci rendiamo conto che
    il confine tra biologico  e  artificiale  e' tanto labile da
    oscillare avanti e indietro  come  un  pendolo,  magari  per
    portarci  alla  raccapricciante  scoperta di essere a nostra
    volta, senza averlo mai  saputo, creature sintetiche (il che
    accade in molti, memorabili racconti,  come  il  celeberrimo
    "Impostore"  del  1953 e "Le formiche elettriche" del 1969).
    Schizofrenica e' la  divinita',  l'essere  superiore, il Dio
    che ha molti  nomi  e  molte  nature  non  fuse  in  maniera
    armonica  ma contrapposte l'una all'altra in un groviglio di
    tensioni ambivalenti: si passa dalla bonta' all'indifferenza
    alla  cattiveria   alla   malvagita'  quintessenziale  senza
    soluzione di continuita', ed  e'  come  osservare  le  molte
    facce  di  una  pietra  preziosa su cui la luce cade e viene
    rifratta in modo sempre diverso.

       Come Immanuel Kant, Dick  giunge  alla conclusione che il
    noumeno sia inconoscibile all'attivita' teoretica dell'uomo;
    ma,  a  differenza  di  Kant,  non  ammette   una   funzione
    redentrice  della morale, e la possibilita' di una effettiva
    conoscenza e' negata a priori.  L'universo fenomenologico in
    cui si agitano  le  (piu'  o  meno)  spasmodiche crisi della
    nostra coscienza, del nostro vissuto, e' un insieme di  dati
    non  ordinabili  in  sequenza  coerente.   Per  tracciare un
    diagramma attendibile del  mondo  che  abbiamo attorno e che
    abbiamo dentro ci mancano sia le ordinate, sia  le  ascisse;
    tutto  viene  inghiottito dallo spaventoso baratro del nulla
    esistenziale,  e  dopo  che   si  e'  precipitati  al  fondo
    dell'abisso, non resta che rassegnarsi alla lunga  risalita.
    Destinata,  peraltro,  a  fallire.  Perche' non ci sono piu'
    veri  appigli:   la   realta'   si   sfilaccia,  i  rapporti
    interpersonali  vacillano,  la   stessa   autocoscienza   e'
    soggetta  a  drastiche,  repentine revisioni.  E persino gli
    strumenti  piu'  canonici  di  imposessamento  della realta'
    esterna,  primo  fra  tutti  il  linguaggio,   si   rivelano
    inadeguati  al compito.  I vistosi, ripetuti slittamenti nel
    rapporto significante/significato, con la perenne ambiguita'
    delle parole e del  senso che esse dovrebbero rappresentare,
    mutano il processo dialettico in un circolo vizioso che  non
    fa altro che mordersi la coda: crediamo di andare avanti, di
    muoverci,  di  agire,  e  invece  siamo  fermi  allo  stesso
    identico  punto  da cui eravamo partiti.  In un mondo che e'
    solo apparenza, illusione, inganno.  Fantasma di se stesso e
    delle categorie del nostro conoscere.

       La maggiore grandezza di Philip Dick sta, a mio giudizio,
    nella  sua  capacita'  di  essere  a  un  tempo  scrittore e
    filosofo, ideologo e intrattenitore.  Sin dagli inizi  della
    sua  carriera, senza mai rinnegare le origini "popolari" del
    genere che ha  scelto  come  mezzo  di  espressione, Dick ha
    accettato  le  convenzioni  della  fantascienza,  i   luoghi
    comuni,  i  topoi  canonizzati  (e talora sclerotizzati) dal
    passato storico della science  fiction.  Ha saputo usare gli
    stereotipi  piu'  classici,  dal  viaggio  nel  tempo   agli
    universi   paralleli,   dai   poteri   extrasensoriali  alla
    colonizzazione   di   nuovi   pianeti,   dall'estrapolazione
    sociologica   all'avventura    spaziale,   piegandoli   alle
    necessita' del complesso discorso che  andava  tessendo.   I
    suoi  romanzi  e  i suoi racconti sono colmi di sorprese, di
    trovate, di azione,  e  anche  di  molto  altro.  Li si puo'
    leggere a svariati livelli; ci si puo' limitare  al  piacere
    epidermico  di  trame  che  spesso  brillano  per  vivacita'
    d'invenzione  fantastica,  oppure  si  puo' scendere piu' in
    profondita' ed esplorare  gli  abissi  del  nulla che la sua
    narrativa spalanca sotto i nostri piedi.

       Il divertimento (intelligente) e' comunque assicurato.

     Quante  cose  inutili  facciamo inseguendo  stoltamente  i
    nostri  istinti. Tempo perso, avrei detto una  volta.  Oggi
    sono  invece  ore e giorni regalati: rubati con  scaltrezza
    alla vita che corre.
     Ti  sei  gia'  collegato  con nirvana?  C'e'  un  link  da
    repubblica.it. L'hai visto il film? Io non resistevo piu' a
    quell'incalzare  di secondi che inesorabilmente  scorrevano
    all'indietro.  Il tempo ha un fascino a cui e'  impossibile
    sottrarsi.  Basta  rallentare un attimo  e  sei  perso  per
    sempre;  ma, se anche inavvertitamente, acceleri  il  passo
    sei fuori: isolato dal reale, distante da tutto. Che fatica
    ballare a tempo con il mondo.
     Sai,  non  e' facile fare ogni cosa al meglio, soprattutto
    quelle impossibili. Non capita solamente a Solo di ripetere
    inesorabilmente all'infinito le stesse cazzate.  Tutti  noi
    siamo  soli;  talvolta, quando riusciamo  a  fermarci  e  a
    meditare, ci accorgiamo di essere anche stelle. Stelle  che
    possono  rendere  serena anche la notte  piu'  buia.  E  le
    stelle  non possono essere cancellate, le stelle  non  sono
    uno scherzo. Credo sia stato Galileo a dire che non si puo'
    cogliere  un fiore senza che tremi una stella.  Sono  molto
    suscettibili  le stelle: non conviene mai farle  incazzare,
    quindi leggi con attenzione il tuo oroscopo.
     E  Lisa? Quale e' la vera Lisa: quella felice e innamorata
    che  Jimi sogna di aver perso per pura distrazione?  Quella
    che  la  Okosama  Star  usa come Devil:  quel  meraviglioso
    demone che tutti ci portiamo dentro, l'amore? Oppure quella
    chiusa  in un fluido chip che suggerisce a Naima parole  di
    fuoco: forti e precise come una freccia.
     E  Maria?  Tenera e dolcissima puttana cancellata  per  un
    capriccio  di Solo: non avrebbe potuto chiudere  un  attimo
    gli  occhi,  lasciarsi  andare,  dimenticare...  Tutti  noi
    abbiamo  un  armadio  che non apriamo  mai.  Ci  sono  cose
    vecchie,   libri,  pantaloni  delle  misure   oramai   piu'
    improbabili,   orrende  cravatte,  magliette   e   pullover
    infeltriti.  Per  tutti il mondo finisce  dietro  a  quelle
    ante; nessuno ne ha poi fatto un motivo di autodistruzione.
    E  Maria,  Maria cosa c'entrava? Lei voleva  continuare  il
    gioco; lei ci stava: era il suo mestiere.
     Piu'  ci  penso e piu' mi convinco che Solo  e'  stato  un
    grande  stronzo:  lui stesso credo se  ne  sia  reso  conto
    quando  si accorge che Jimi ha preso proprio sul  serio  le
    sue   lamentele:  ancora  un  ultimo  click  e  lui   sara'
    cancellato, e dopo...
     E  dopo... Caro mio, potevi pensarci prima al dopo:  sarai
    pure  un  fiocco di neve ma mi e' sembrato di intuire  cio'
    non  ti  andasse  poi del tutto a fagiolo. Sai,  quando  si
    evocano le favole non sempre il felice finale coincide  con
    le  nostre  speranze. Pensa a quanti bei principi  si  sono
    viste  fregare le future spose da orribili ranocchi. E  per
    la  stragrande parte dei  lettori questo era il  piu' bello
    dei finali.
     Se  ancora  potessi mandarti una E-mail  ti  chiederei  se
    adesso  sei finalmente felice, se il gioco ti e'  piaciuto,
    se  sei contento di non essere piu'. Tempo perso: i fiocchi
    di  neve  non hanno accounts, soprattutto se non cadono  in
    nessun posto.
     Difficilmente  potrai  leggere  quindi  questo  messaggio;
    comunque sia, sai che hai combinato un bel casino? Jimi  ha
    perso lavoro e posizione, per non parlare dei problemi  dei
    chips  di  credito contraffatti. Per di piu'  non  sa  piu'
    quale  fosse la sua Lisa, comincia a non ricordare  neppure
    il  colore dei suoi occhi: probabilmente erano blu  ma  non
    riesce  piu'  a  fidarsi  dei suoi ricordi,  neppure  delle
    canzoni. Credi che adesso lui possa essere felice? In quale
    nuovo  gioco  potra' ancora tuffarsi senza  il  terrore  di
    affogare?
     Joystick  mettera' in tasca i soldi che ha sottratto  alla
    Okosama?  Spero  che non li sprechi tutti nell'acquisto  di
    nuovi occhi che l'obbligherebbero ad osservare un mondo che
    gli  farebbe  piu'  schifo di quello che  ieri  a  malapena
    intravedeva.
     Naima  avra' finalmente qualcosa da ricordare  o  restera'
    eternamente una Lisa improbabile e defunta?
     Ma  caro Solo, non ti avevano forse programmato per  stare
    al tuo posto; non ti avevano forse detto di non fare troppo
    casino,  di stare buono che ci avresti comunque guadagnato.
    Bastava  che avessi un'incertezza un poco - solo un   poco:
    no ti si chiedeva molto in fondo - piu' netta. Jimi avrebbe
    esitato ancora un attimo, loro avrebbero sfondato la porta:
    i  titoli sarebbero scesi leggeri... come neve. Invece  con
    questo casino che hai messo in piedi come potranno mai fare
    un  Nirvana  II parte:  ti sei fregato con  le  tue  stesse
    mani. Forse ti resta il CD, ma non sara' poi gran cosa...

                  "@{b}OUR GUEST OF HONOUR: JAMES MORROW@{ub}"

                      @{i}a cura di Vittorio Curtoni@{ui}


 JAMES MORROW is one of the leading American writers in the  field  of
 speculative fiction. The winner of many important literary awards, he
 is reputed to be the rightful heir  to  the  tradition  of  satirical
 literature  ranging from Jonathan Swift to Kurt Vonnegut Jr. With his
 unique blending of fantastic, science fiction, realism and humor he's
 telling,  in  his  novels  and  stories, the parable of a "bewildered
 pilgrim" (as he defines himself) in search of the truth about God and
 the meaning of human life. His first novel, THE WINE OF VIOLENCE, was
 published in 1981. Over the years it was followed by wonderful novels
 such  as  THIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD ENDS, ONLY BEGOTTEN DAUGHTER, and
 TOWING JEHOVAH, the first chapter in his proposed trilogy  about  the
 death  of  God.  Volume two of this series, BLAMELESS IN ABBADON, has
 recently been released in the States. The story we  present  here  is
 from  his  latest  collection,  BIBLE  STORIES FOR ADULTS, an amazing
 retelling of biblical tales and much  more.  KNOWN  BUT  TO  GOD  AND
 WILBUR  HINES  is one of his few not fantastic stories, but possesses
 all the caustic strength typical of Morrow's writing.

 JAMES  MORROW  e'  uno  dei  piu'  importanti  autori  americani   di
 "speculative fiction". Vincitore di molti importanti premi letterari,
 e' giudicato l'erede per eccellenza  della  tradizione  di  narrativa
 satirica  che  va  da  Jonathan  Swift  a  Kurt  Vonnegut Jr. Col suo
 irripetibile amalgama di fantastico, fantascienza, realismo  e  humor
 sta  narrando,  nei  suoi  romanzi  e  racconti,  la  parabola  di un
 "pellegrino stupefatto" (come si definisce) in cerca della verita' su
 Dio e sul significato dell'esistenza umana. Il suo primo romanzo, THE
 WINE OF VIOLENCE, e' stato pubblicato nel 1981. Nel corso degli  anni
 e'  stato  seguito  da  straordinari romanzi come THIS IS THE WAY THE
 WORLD ENDS, ONLY BEGOTTEN DAUGHTER (NEL NOME  DELLA  FIGLIA,  Interno
 Giallo  Editore),  e  piu'  di  recente  da  TOWING JEHOVAH (L'ULTIMO
 VIAGGIO DI DIO, Il Saggiatore  Editore),  primo  capitolo  della  sua
 trilogia  sulla  morte  di  Dio.  Il  secondo volume di questa serie,
 BLAMELESS IN ABBADON, e'  apparso  da  poco  negli  Stati  Uniti.  Il
 racconto  che  presentiamo  qui e' tratto dalla sua ultima antologia,
 BIBLE STORIES FOR ADULTS (di imminente uscita in  Italia  col  titolo
 STORIE  DI  BIBBIA  PER  ADULTI  presso Nuova Pratiche Editrice), una
 sorprendente riscrittura di episodi biblici, e molto  di  piu'.  NOTO
 SOLTANTO  A  DIO  E  WILBUR  HINES e' uno dei suoi pochi racconti non
 fantastici, ma contiene tutta la forza caustica che e'  tipica  della
 narrativa di Morrow.

 My keeper faces  east,  his  gaze  lifting  above  the  treetops  and
 traveling across the national necropolis clear to the glassy Potomac.
 His bayonet rises into the morning sky, as if to skewer the  sun.  In
 his  mind  he  ticks  off  the  seconds,  one  for  each  shell  in a
 twenty-one-gun salute.  Being  dead  has  its  advantages.  True,  my
 pickled  flesh  is  locked  away  inside this cold marble box, but my
 senses float free, as if they were orbiting satellites  beaming  back
 snippets  of the world. I see the city, dense with black citizens and
 white marble. I smell the Virginia air, the ripe grass,  the  river's
 scum.  I  hear  my keeper's boots as he pivots south, the echo of his
 heels coming together: two clicks, always  two,  like  a  telegrapher
 transmitting  an  eternal  I.  My  keeper  pretends not to notice the
 crowd-the fifth graders, Rotarians, garden clubbers, random tourists.
 Occasionally  he  catches  a  cub scout's bright yellow bandanna or a
 punkerfs pink mohawk. "Known but to God," it says  on  my  tomb.  Not
 true,  for  I'm  known to myself as well. I understand Wilbur Simpson
 Hines perfectly. Thock, thock, thock goes my keeper's Springfield  as
 he  transfers  it  from  his  left  shoulder to his right. He pauses,
 twenty-one seconds again, then marches south  twenty-one  paces  down
 the  narrow  black  path,  protecting me from the Bethesda Golden Age
 Society and the Glen Echo Lions Club.

 I joined the army to learn how to kill my father. An irony: the  only
 time  the  old  man  ever  showed  a  glimmer of satisfaction with me
 occurred  when  I  announced  I  was  dropping  out  of  college  and
 enlisting.  He thought I wanted to make the world safe for democracy,
 when in fact I wanted to make it safe from him. I intended to sign up
 under  a  false  name. Become competent with a rifle. Then one night,
 while my father slept, I would sneak away from basic training,  press
 the  muzzle  to  his  head-  Harry Hines the hot-blooded Pennsylvania
 farmer, laying into me  with  his  divining  rod  till  my  back  was
 freckled  with slivers of hazelwood- and blow him straight to Satan's
 backyard. You see how irrational I was in those days?  The  tomb  has
 smoothed  me out. There's no treatment like this box, no therapy like
 death. Click, click, my keeper faces east. He pauses  for  twenty-one
 seconds, watching the morning mist hovering above the river.

 "I  want  to  be a doughboy," I told them at the Boalsburg Recruiting
 Station. They parceled me. Name: Bill  Johnson.  Address:  Bellefonte
 YMCA.  Complexion:  fair.  Eye  color:  blue.  Hair: red. "Get on the
 scales," they said. They measured me, and for a few dicey  minutes  I
 feared  that,  being short and scrawny- my father always detested the
 fact that I wasn't a  gorilla  like  him-  I'd  flunk  out,  but  the
 sergeant  just  winked  at  me and said, "Stand on our toes, Bill." I
 did,  stretching  to  the  minimum  height.  "You  probably   skipped
 breakfast  this  morning,  right?"  said  the sergeant. Another wink.
 "Breakfast is good for a few pounds." "Yes, sir."

 My keeper turns: click, click, left face.  Thock,  thock,  thock,  he
 transfers  his  rifle  from his right shoulder to his left. He pauses
 for twenty-one seconds then marches north down the black path. Click,
 click,  he  spins  toward  the  Potomac  and  waits. It's hard to say
 exactly why my plans changed. At Camp Sinclair they put me in a crisp
 khaki  uniform  and  gave  me  a mess kit, a canteen, and a Remington
 rifle, and suddenly there I was, Private Bill Johnson of the American
 Expeditionary  Forces,  D  Company,  Eighteenth  U.S. Infantry, First
 Division. And, of course, everybody was saying what a great  time  we
 were going to have driving the Heinies into the Baltic and seeing gay
 Paree. The Yanks were coming, and I wanted to be one  of  them-  Bill
 Johnson ne'e Wilbur Hines wasn't about to risk an AWOL conviction and
 a tour in the brig while his  friends  were  off  visiting  la  belle
 France  and  its French belles. After my discharge, there'd be plenty
 of time to show Harry Hines what his son had learned in the army.

 They're  changing  the  guard.   For   the   next   half   hour,   an
 African-American  PFC will protect me. We used to call them coloreds,
 of course. Niggers, to tell you  the  truth.  Today  this  particular
 African-American  has  a  fancy job patrolling my tomb, but when they
 laid me here in 1921 his people weren't even allowed in  the  regular
 divisions.  The  365th,  that  was the nigger regiment, and when they
 finally reached France, you know  what  Pershing  had  them  do?  Dig
 trenches, unload ships, and bury white doughboys. But my divisionwe'd
 get a crack at glory, oh, yes. They shipped us over  on  the  British
 tub Magnolia and dropped us down near the front line a mile west of a
 jerkwater Frog village, General Robert Bullard  in  charge.  I'm  not
 sure  what  I  expected from France. My buddy Alvin Platt said they'd
 fill our canteens with red wine every morning. They didn't. Somehow I
 thought  I'd  be  in  the  war without actually fighting the war, but
 suddenly there we were, sharing a four-foot  trench  with  a  million
 cooties  and  dodging  Mieniewaffers  like some idiots you'd see in a
 newsreel at the Ziegfeld with  a  Fairbanks  picture  and  a  Chaplin
 two-reeler, everybody listening for the dreaded cry "Gas attack!" and
 waiting for the order to move forward. By April of 1918 we'd all seen
 enough  victims  of  Boche mustard- coughing up blood, shitting their
 gizzards out, weeping from blind eyes- that we clung to our gas masks
 like little boys hugging their teddies.

 My  keeper  marches south, his bayonet cutting a straight incision in
 the summer air. I wonder if he's ever used it. Probably not.  I  used
 mine  plenty  in '18. "If a Heinie comes toward you with his hands up
 yelling 'Kamerad,' don't be fooled," Sergeant Fiskejohn told us  back
 at  Camp  Sinclair.  "He's sure as hell got a potato masher in one of
 those hands. Go at him from below, and you'll stop him easy.  A  long
 thrust in the belly, then a short one, then a butt stroke to the chin
 if he's still on his feet, which he won't be." On May  28  the  order
 came  through,  and  we climbed out of the trenches and fought what's
 now called the Battle of Cantigny, but it wasn't really a battle,  it
 was  a  grinding push into the German salient with hundreds of men on
 both sides getting hacked to bits like  we  were  a  bunch  of  steer
 haunches  hanging  in our barns back home. Evidently the Boche caught
 more than we did, because after  forty-five  minutes  that  town  was
 ours,  and  we  waltzed  down  the gunky streets singing our favorite
 ditty.

 The mademoiselle from gay Paree, parlez-vous?
 The mademoiselle from gay Paree, parlez-vous?
 The mademoiselle from gay Paree,
 She had the clap and she gave it to me,
 Hinky Dinky, parlez-vous?

 I'll never forget the first time  I  drew  a  bead  on  a  Heinie,  a
 sergeant  with  a  handlebar mustache flaring from his upper lip like
 antlers. I aimed, I squeezed, I killed him, just like that: now  he's
 up,  now  he's  down- a man I didn't even know. I thought how easy it
 was going to be shooting Harry Hines, a man I  hated.  For  the  next
 three  days  the  Boche counterattacked, and then I did learn to hate
 them. Whenever somebody lost an arm or a leg to a potato masher, he'd
 cry  for  his  mother, in English mostly but sometimes in Spanish and
 sometimes Yiddish, and you can't  see  that  happen  more  than  once
 without  wanting  to  kill  every  Heinie  in Europe, right up to the
 Kaiser himself. I did as Fiskejohn said. A boy would  stumble  toward
 me  with  his  hands up"Kamerad! Kamerad!"- and I'd go for his belly.
 There's something about having a Remington in your  grasp  with  that
 lovely  slice  of steel jutting from the bore. I'd open the fellow up
 left to right, like I was underlining a passage in the sharpshooter's
 manual,  and  he'd spill out like soup. It was interesting and legal.
 Once I saw a sardine. On the whole, though, Fiskejohn was wrong.  The
 dozen boys I rlpped weren't holding potato mashers or anything else.

 I  switched  tactics.  I  took  prisoners.  "Kamerad!" Five at first.
 "Kamerad!" Six. "Kamerad!" Seven. Except that seventh boy in fact had
 a  masher,  which  he promptly lobbed into my chest. Lucky for me, it
 bounced back. The Heinie caught enough of the kick to  get  his  face
 torn  off,  whereas  I caught only enough to earn myself a bed in the
 field hospital. For a minute I didn't know  I  was  wounded.  I  just
 looked  at  that  boy  who  had  no  nose, no lower jaw, and wondered
 whether perhaps I should use a grenade on Harry Hines. Click,  click,
 my  keeper  turns  to the left. Thock, thock, thock, he transfers his
 rifle, waits. The Old Guardthe  Third  U.S.  Infantry-  never  quits.
 Twenty  four  hours  a day, seven days a week: can you imagine? Three
 A.M. on Christmas morning, say, with snow tumbling  down  and  nobody
 around  except  a  lot of dead veterans, and here's this grim, silent
 sentinel strutting past my tomb? It gives me the creeps. The division
 surgeons  spliced  me  together as best they could, but I knew they'd
 left some chips behind because my chest hurt like hell. A week  after
 I  was  taken  off  the critical list, they gave me a month's pay and
 sent me to Bar-le-Duc for some rest and relaxation,  which  everybody
 knew meant cognac and whores.

 The whole village was a red-light district, and if you had the francs
 you could find love around the clock, though you'd do well  to  study
 the  choices  and  see  who  had that itchy look a lady acquires when
 she's got the clap. And so it was that on the first of July,  as  the
 hot French twilight poured into a cootie-ridden bordello on the Place
 Vendome, Wilbur Hines's willy finally  put  to  port  after  nineteen
 years  at  sea.  Like  Cantigny,  it was quick and confusing and over
 before I knew it. I had six more days coming to  me,  though,  and  I
 figured it would get better. My keeper heads north, twenty-one paces.
 The sun beats down. The sweatband of  his  cap  is  rank  and  soggy.
 Click,  click:  right  face.  His  eyes  lock  on  the river. I loved
 Bar-le-Duc. The citizens treated me like  a  war  hero,  saluting  me
 wherever  I  went. There's no telling how far you'll go in this world
 if you're willing to bellyrip a  few  German  teenagers.  Beyond  the
 Poilu  and the hookers, the cafes were also swarming with Bolsheviks,
 and I must admit their ideas made sense to meat least, they did by my
 fourth  glass  of  Chateau  d'Yquem.  After Cantigny, with its flying
 metal and Alvin Platt walking around with a  bloody  stump  screaming
 "Mommy!"  I'd  begun  asking the same questions as the Bolshies, such
 as, "Why are we having this war, anyway?" When I told them my  family
 was  poor,  the  Bolshies  got  all  excited,  and  I  hadn't felt so
 important since the army took me. I actually gave those fellows a few
 francs,  and  they  promptly  signed  me  up  as  a  noncom  in their
 organization.  So  now  I  held  two  ranks,  PFC  in  the   American
 Expeditionary   Forces   and  lance  corporal  in  the  International
 Brotherhood of Proletarian Veterans or whatever the  hell  they  were
 calling themselves.

 My  third  night on the cathouse circuit, I got into an argument with
 one of the tarts. Fifi- I always  called  them  Fifi-  decided  she'd
 given  me special treatment on our second round, something to do with
 her mouth, her bouche, and now she wanted twenty  francs  instead  of
 the usual ten. Those ladies thought every doughboy was made of money.
 All you heard in Bar-le-Duc was "les Americains, beaucoup  d'argent."
 "Dix  francs,"  I  said. "Vingt," Fifi insisted. Her eyes looked like
 two dead snails. Her hair was the  color  of  Holstein  dung.  "Dix."
 "Vingt- or I tell ze MP you rip me," Fifi threatened. She meant rape.
 "Dix" I said throwing the coins on the bed, whereupon Fifi  announced
 with  a  tilted  smile  that  she had "a bad case of ze VD" and hoped
 she'd given it to me.

 Just remember, you weren't there. Your body wasn't full of raw metal,
 and  you  didn't  have  Fifi's  clap, and nobody was expecting you to
 maintain a lot of distinctions between the surrendering boys you were
 supposed to stab and the Frog tarts you weren't. It was hot. My chest
 hurt. Half my friends had  died  capturing  a  pissant  hamlet  whose
 streets  were  made  of  horse manure. And all I could see were those
 nasty little clap germs gnawing at my favorite organs.  My  Remington
 stood by the door. The bayonet was tinted now, the color of a turnip;
 so different from the war itself, that bayonet- no question about its
 purpose.  As  I  pushed  it into Fifi and listened to the rasp of the
 steel   against   her   pelvis,   I   thought   how   prophetic   her
 mispronunciation  had  been: I tell ze MP you rip me. I used the fire
 escape. My hands were wet and warm. All the way back to  my  room,  I
 felt  a  gnawing  in  my gut like I'd been gassed. I wished I'd never
 stood on my toes in the Boalsburg Recruiting Station. A ditty helped.
 After six reprises and a bottle of cognac, I finally fell asleep.

 The mademoiselle from Bar-le-Duc, parlez-vous?
 The mademoiselle from Bar-le-Duc, parlez-vous?
 The mademoiselle from Bar-le-Duc,
 She'll screw you in the chicken coop,
 Hinky Dinky, parlez-vous?

 On the sixteenth of July, I boarded one of those 40-and-8 trains  and
 rejoined  my  regiment,  now  dug in along the Marne. A big fight had
 already happened there, sometime in '14, and  they  were  hoping  for
 another.  I  was  actually glad to be leaving Bar-le-Duc, for all its
 wonders and delights. The local gendarmes, I'd  heard,  were  looking
 into  the  Fifi  matter. Click, click, thock, thock, thock. My keeper
 pauses, twenty-one seconds. He marches south down the black path.  At
 the  Marne they put me in charge of a Hotchkissmachine gun, and I set
 it up on a muddy hill, the better to cover the forward  trench  where
 they'd stationed my platoon. I had two good friends in that hole, and
 so when Captain Mallery showed up with orders  from  le  general-  we
 were  now  part  of  the  XX  French  Corps- saying I should haul the
 Hotchkiss a mile downstream, I went berserk.

 "Those boys are completely exposed," I  protested.  The  junk  in  my
 chest  was  on  fire.  "If there's an infantry attack, we'll lose 'em
 all." "Move  the  Hotchkiss,  Private  Johnson,"  the  captain  said.
 "That's  not  a very good idea," I said. "Move it." "They'll be naked
 as jaybirds." "Move it. Now." A couple  of  wars  later,  of  course,
 attacks  on  officers  by  their  own men got raised to a kind of art
 form- I know all about it, I like to read the  tourists'  newspapers-
 but  this  was  1918  and  the  concept  was  still in its infancy. I
 certainly didn't display  much  finesse  as  I  pulled  out  my  Colt
 revolver  and  in a pioneering effort shot Mallery through the heart.
 It was all pretty crude.

 And then, damn, who should happen by but the CO himself,  crusty  old
 Colonel  Horrocks,  his eyes bulging with disbelief. He told me I was
 arrested. He said I'd hang. But by then I was fed up. I  was  fed  up
 with  gas scares and Alvin Platt getting his arm blown off. I was fed
 up with being an American infantry private and an honorary Bolshevik,
 fed  up with greedy hookers and gonorrhea and the whole dumb, bloody,
 smelly war. So I ran. That's right: ran, retreated, quit the  western
 front. Unfortunately, I picked the wrong direction. I'd meant to make
 my way into Chateau-Thierry and hide out in the  cathouses  till  the
 Mallery  situation  blew  over,  but  instead  I found myself heading
 toward Deutschland itself, oh, yes,  straight  for  the  enemy  line.
 Stupid,  stupid.  When  I  saw  my  error,  I  threw up my hands. And
 screamed. "Kamerad! Kamerad!"

 Bill Johnson ne'e Wilbur Hines never fought in the Second  Battle  of
 the  Marne. He never helped his regiment drive the Heinies back eight
 miles, capture four thousand of the Kaiser's best  troops,  and  kill
 God  knows  how  many  more.  This private missed it all, because the
 Boche hit him with everything they had. Machine-gun fire,  grapeshot,
 rifle  bullets,  shrapnel. A potato masher detonated. A mustard shell
 went off. Name: unknown. Address: unknown. Complexion:  charred.  Eye
 color:  no  eyes. Hair: burned off. Weeks later, when they scraped me
 off the Marne floodplain, it was obvious I was a prime candidate  for
 the  Arlington  program. Lucky for me, Colonel Horrocks got killed at
 Soissons. He'd have voted me down. As I said, I read the  newspapers.
 I  keep up. That's how I learned about my father. One week after they
 put me in this box, Harry Hines cheated at seven-card  stud  and  was
 bludgeoned to death by the loser with a ball peen hammer. It made the
 front page of the Centre  County  Democrat.  It's  raining.  The  old
 people  hoist  their  umbrellas;  the  fifth  graders glom onto their
 teacher; the cub scouts march away like a platoon of  midgets.  Am  I
 angry about my life? For many years, yes, I was furious, but then the
 eighties rolled around, mine and the century's, and I realized I'd be
 dead  by  now  anyway. So I won't leave you with any bitter thoughts.
 I'll leave you with a pretty song. Listen.

 The mademoiselle from Is-sur-Tille, parlez-vous?
 The mademoiselle from Is-sur-Tille, parlez-vous?
 The mademoiselle from Is-sur-Tille,
 She can zig-zig-zig like a spinning wheel,
 Hinky Dinky, parlez-vous?

 My keeper remains, facing east.

      Il mio guardiano e' rivolto a est.  Il suo sguardo si alza
    al di sopra degli alberi e viaggia sulla necropoli nazionale
    fino al vitreo Potomac.  La  sua baionetta si leva nel cielo
    del mattino, come per trafiggere il sole.  Nella  sua  mente
    c'e'il ticchettio dei secondi, uno per ogni pallottola in un
    saluto  militare  da  ventuno colpi.  Essere morti ha i suoi
    vantaggi.  Vero,  la  mia  carne  in  salamoia  e' chiusa in
    questa fredda scatola di  marmo,  ma  i  miei  sensi  vagano
    liberi,    come   fossero   satelliti   orbitanti   che   mi
    ritrasmettono  brandelli   del   mondo.    Vedo  la  citta',
    fittamente popolata di abitanti neri e marmi bianchi.  Fiuto
    l'aria della  Virginia,  l'erba  matura,  la  sporcizia  del
    fiume.   Odo  gli  stivali  del  mio guardiano che ora ruota
    verso sud, lanciandomi la  doppia  eco  dei suoi tacchi: due
    ticchettii, sempre due,  come  un  telegrafo  che  trasmetta
    un'eterna I.

      Il  mio  guardiano finge di non accorgersi della folla, di
    studenti, rotariani,  amanti  del  giardinaggio, turisti per
    sbaglio.  Di tanto  in  tanto  percepisce  la  presenza  del
    fazzoletto giallo vivo di un lupetto o del taglio di capelli
    alla  moicano,  viola, di un punk.  "Noto soltanto a Dio" e'
    scritto sulla mia tomba.  Non  e' vero, perche' io sono noto
    anche a  me  stesso.   Io  capisco  alla  perfezione  Wilbur
    Simpson  Hines.   Toc,  toc,  toc  fa lo Springfield del mio
    guardiano, che trasferisce  il  fucile dalla spalla sinistra
    alla destra.  Fa un'altra pausa, di  nuovo  ventun  secondi,
    poi riprende la marcia in direzione sud, ventuno passi sullo
    stretto  sentiero nero, per proteggermi dalla Betesda Golden
    Age Society e dal Glen Echo Lions Club.

      Sono  entrato  nell'esercito  per   imparare  il  modo  di
    uccidere mio  padre.   Ironico:  l'unica  volta  in  cui  il
    vecchio  abbia  dato un vago segno di soddisfazione nei miei
    confronti e' stato quando gli  ho annunciato che lasciavo il
    college per arruolarmi.  Credeva volessi rendere piu' sicuro
    il mondo democratico, mentre in effetti io  volevo  metterlo
    al  sicuro  da  lui.   Volevo  arruolarmi  sotto falso nome.
    Imparare a usare il fucile.  Poi una notte, mentre mio padre
    dormiva, sarei sgattaiolato  via  dal campo d'addestramento,
    gli avrei premuto la canna alla testa  (la  testa  di  Harry
    Hines,  l'agricoltore  della  Pennsylvania dal sangue caldo,
    l'uomo che mi ha martoriato  la schiena con la sua bacchetta
    da rabdomante fino a riempirmela di scorie di nocciolo) e lo
    avrei scaraventato diritto nel cortile  di  Satana.   Vedete
    quanto  fossi  irrazionale  a  quei  tempi?   La tomba mi ha
    raddrizzato.  Non  esiste  una  cura  paragonabile  a questa
    scatola; non c'e' terapia all'altezza della morte.

      Clic, clic, il mio guardiano si e' girato verso  est.   Fa
    una  pausa  di ventuno secondi, guarda la nebbia del mattino
    sospesa sul fiume.   "Voglio  entrare  in fanteria" dissi al
    Centro Reclutamento di Boalsburg.  Quelli  mi  passarono  al
    setaccio.    Nome:   Bill   Johnson.    Indirizzo:  YMCA  di
    Bellefonte.   Carnagione:   chiara.    Colore  degli  occhi:
    azzurro.  Capelli: rossi.  "Mettiti sulla bilancia" dissero.
    Mi misurarono, e per qualche atroce minuto temetti di venire
    scartato, perche' sono basso e tutto pelle e ossa (mio padre
    ha sempre detestato il fatto che non fossi un  gorilla  come
    lui).  Ma il sergente mi strizzo' l'occhio e disse: "Mettiti
    in  punta  di  piedi,  Bill." Obbedii, e arrivai all'altezza
    minima.  "Probabilmente stamattina hai saltato la colazione,
    giusto?" disse il  sergente.   Un'altra strizzatina d'occhi.
    "La colazione e'  ottima  per  mettere  su  qualche  chilo."
    "Sissignore."

      Il  mio  guardiano  si  gira: clic, clic, ha ruotato sulla
    sinistra.  Toc, toc, toc: trasferisce il fucile dalla spalla
    destra alla sinistra.  Fa una  pausa di ventuno secondi, poi
    si mette in marcia in  direzione  nord  sul  sentiero  nero.
    Clic,  clic.   Si  gira  verso  il  Potomac  e  aspetta.  E'
    difficile  dire  esattamente  perche'  i  miei  piani  siano
    cambiati.  A Camp Sinclair  mi  infilarono in una frusciante
    uniforme cachi e mi diedero gavetta e posate, una borraccia,
    e un fucile  Remington;  e  di  colpo  eccomi  la',  soldato
    semplice  Bill  Johnson  del  Corpo di Spedizione Americano,
    Compagnia D, Diciottesimo Reggimento di Fanteria degli Stati
    Uniti, Prima Divisione.   E,  ovviamente, tutti raccontavano
    quanto ci saremmo  divertiti  a  ricacciare  i  crucchi  nel
    Baltico  e a vedere l'allegra Pari'.  Gli Yankee stavano per
    partire, e io volevo essere  uno  di loro: Bill Johnson nato
    Wilbur Hines non avrebbe rischiato una condanna per  assenza
    ingiustificata,  non  si  sarebbe fatto un giretto in galera
    mentre i suoi  amici  se  ne  andavano  a  visitare la belle
    France e le bellezze francesi.  Dopo il congedo, avrei avuto
    tutto il tempo di  dimostrare  a  Harry  Hines  cosa  avesse
    imparato suo figlio sotto le armi.

      C'e'  il  cambio della guardia.  Per la prossima mezz'ora,
    mi proteggera' un  altro  soldato  semplice  scelto, un nero
    d'America.  Noi ovviamente li chiamavamo  colorati.   Negri,
    per dire la verita'.  Oggi questo particolare nero d'America
    ha un lavoretto chic, fa la ronda attorno alla mia tomba, ma
    quando  mi  hanno  deposto qui nel 1921 la sua gente non era
    nemmeno accettata nelle  divisioni  regolari.  Il reggimento
    dei negri era il trecentosessantacinquesimo, e  quando  alla
    fine sono arrivati in Francia, sapete cosa gli ha fatto fare
    Pershing?   Scavare  trincee,  scaricare  navi, e seppellire
    fanti  bianchi.   Ma   la   mia  divisione...   Noi  avremmo
    assaggiato la gloria, oh, si'.   Ci  hanno  imbarcati  sulla
    bagnarola  inglese Magnolia e sbarcati nelle vicinanze delle
    prime  linee,  un  chilometro   e   mezzo   a  ovest  di  un
    insignificante paesello dei  Mangiarane.   Ci  comandava  il
    generale   Robert  Bullard.   Non  so  di  preciso  cosa  mi
    aspettassi dalla Francia.  Il mio amicone Alvin Platt diceva
    che tutte le mattine  ci  avrebbero  riempito le borracce di
    vino rosso.  Mica vero.  Non so come, pensavo di partecipare
    alla guerra senza  realmente  combattere,  ma  di  colpo  ci
    ritrovammo a dividere una trincea larga un metro e venti con
    un  milione  di pidocchi e a schivare Mieniewaffers come gli
    idioti che si potevano vedere  nei cinegiornali assieme a un
    film di Fairbanks e una comica di  Chaplin.   Tutti  con  le
    orecchie  diritte  nel  caso  fosse risuonato il temuto urlo
    "Attacco  coi  gas!",  ad  aspettare  l'ordine  di avanzare.
    Entro l'aprile  del  1918  avevamo  visto  tante  di  quelle
    vittime  del  gas mostarda dei crucchi (uomini che tossivano
    sangue, sputavano le  budella,  piangevano  da occhi ciechi)
    che ci tenevamo strette le maschere  antigas  come  fanno  i
    ragazzini con l'orsacchiotto.

      Il  mio  guardiano  marcia  verso  sud.   La sua baionetta
    traccia   un'incisione   perfetta   nell'aria   dell'estate.
    Chissa' se l'ha mai  usata.   Probabilmente no.  Io ho usato
    la mia un sacco di volte  nel  '18.   "Se  un  crucco  viene
    avanti a mani alzate urlando Kamerad, non fatevi fregare" ci
    aveva  detto il sergente Fiskejohn a Camp Sinclair.  "Sicuro
    come  l'oro  che  in   una   delle   mani  ha  una  granata.
    Attaccatelo dal basso e sara' facile  fermarlo.   Una  lunga
    infilzata  alla  pancia, poi una piu' breve, poi un colpo al
    mento col calcio del fucile se fosse ancora in piedi, ma non
    lo sara'." Il  28  maggio  arrivo'  l'ordine, e noi saltammo
    fuori dalle trincee e combattemmo quella che oggi si  chiama
    la   Battaglia  di  Cantigny,  ma  non  e'  mica  stata  una
    battaglia, e' stata un'avanzata-tritacarne verso il saliente
    tedesco  con  centinaia  di  uomini  di  entrambe  le  parti
    macinati a pezzettini,  come  fossimo  grappoli di quarti di
    bue appesi nei granai di  casa.   Evidentemente  ai  crucchi
    ando'  peggio  che a noi, perche' dopo quarantacinque minuti
    la  citta'  era   nostra,   e   noi  danzammo  nelle  strade
    appiccicose di sangue cantando la nostra arietta preferita.

    Mademoiselle dell'allegra Pari', parlez-vous?
    Mademoiselle dell'allegra Pari', parlez-vous?
    Mademoiselle dell'allegra Pari', parlez-vous?
    Aveva lo scolo e l'ha attaccato a me,
    Bella figliola, parlez-vous?

      Non dimentichero' mai la prima volta che ho fatto fuori un
    crucco, un sergente coi  baffi  a  manubrio  che  sporgevano
    sopra  le  labbra  come  corna  ramificate.   Ho puntato, ho
    premuto il grilletto, l'ho  ucciso.  Fatto.  Un minuto prima
    e' in piedi,  un  minuto  dopo  no.   Un  uomo  che  nemmeno
    conoscevo.   Pensai  quanto  sarebbe  stato facile sparare a
    Harry Hines, un uomo che odiavo.  I crucchi contrattaccarono
    per i tre  giorni  successivi,  e  allora imparai a odiarli.
    Quando qualcuno perdeva un braccio o una gamba per colpa  di
    una granata, piangeva e urlava, invocava la mamma, di solito
    in  inglese  ma  a volte in spagnolo e a volte in Yiddish, e
    non si puo' vedere succedere una cosa del genere piu' di una
    volta senza che ti venga  voglia di uccidere tutti i crucchi
    d'Europa, fino al  Kaiser  in  persona.   Feci  come  diceva
    Fiskejohn.   Un  ragazzo  barcollava  verso me a mani alzate
    (Kamerad!  Kamerad!) e io mi  lanciavo sulla sua pancia.  E'
    una sensazione speciale stringere un Remington tra le  mani,
    con quella deliziosa fetta d'acciaio che sporge dalla canna.
    Squartavo   l'amico   da  sinistra  a  destra,  come  stessi
    sottolineando un passaggio del  manuale del tiratore scelto,
    e lui si versava  fuori  come  brodo.   Era  interessante  e
    legale.   Una  volta  ho  visto  una sardina.  Nell'insieme,
    comunque, Fiskejohn si sbagliava.  La dozzina di ragazzi che
    ho sventrato non avevano in mano granate o altro.

      Cambiai   tattica.    Cominciai    a   fare   prigionieri.
    "Kamerad!"  Cinque  la   prima   volta.    "Kamerad!"   Sei.
    "Kamerad!"  Sette.   Solo  che  quel  settimo  ragazzo aveva
    davvero una granata,  che  mi  tiro'  subito sul petto.  Per
    fortuna rimbalzo'.  Il crucco si godette l'esplosione  tanto
    da  restare  senza  faccia,  mentre  io me la godetti quanto
    bastava per  guadagnarmi  un  letto  nell'ospedale da campo.
    Per un minuto non mi resi conto di  essere  ferito.   Restai
    li' a guardare quel ragazzo che non aveva naso, non aveva la
    parte  inferiore della mascella, e mi chiesi se per caso non
    dovessi usare una granata  con  Harry Hines.  Clic, clic, il
    mio guardiano vira a sinistra.  Toc, toc,  toc,  trasferisce
    il  fucile,  aspetta.  La Vecchia Guardia, il Terzo Fanteria
    USA, non  molla  mai.   Ventiquattro  ore  al  giorno, sette
    giorni a settimana: riuscite  a  immaginarlo?   Le  tre  del
    mattino  del  giorno  di  Natale,  diciamo,  con la neve che
    scende e nessuno in giro se non un branco di veterani morti,
    e  c'e'  questa  sentinella  cupa,  silenziosa,  che cammina
    impettita davanti alla mia tomba.  Mi da' i brividi.

      I chirurghi della  divisione  mi  ricucirono  come  meglio
    potevano,  pero' io sapevo che dovevano avere lasciato fuori
    qualche pezzettino perche' il  petto  mi  faceva un male del
    diavolo.  Una settimana dopo essere stato tolto dalla  lista
    dei  casi critici, mi diedero un mese di paga e mi spedirono
    a Bar-le-Duc per un  po'  di  riposo  e  relax, il che, come
    tutti sapevano, significava cognac e  prostitute.   L'intero
    paese  era  un  quartiere  a  luci rosse, e se avevi i soldi
    potevi  trovare  amore   da   un'alba  all'altra,  anche  se
    conveniva studiare bene le scelte e controllare  chi  avesse
    quello sguardo pungente che spunta nelle signore che si sono
    prese  lo scolo.  E cosi' fu quel primo di luglio, mentre il
    caldo tramonto francese si spandeva in un bordello infestato
    dai pidocchi in Place  Vendome,  che  la barchetta di Wilbur
    Hines  entro'  finalmente  in  porto  dopo  diciannove  anni
    trascorsi in mare.  Come Cantigny,  fu  una  cosa  veloce  e
    confusa  e  fini'  prima che me ne rendessi conto.  Comunque
    avevo ancora sei  giorni  a  disposizione,  e  pensai che la
    faccenda sarebbe migliorata.

      Il mio guardiano si dirige a  nord.   Ventuno  passi.   Il
    sole  picchia  forte.  La fascia interna del suo berretto e'
    rancida e fradicia di  sudore.   Clic, clic: destra.  I suoi
    occhi si puntano sul fiume.  Amavo Bar-le-Duc.  Gli abitanti
    mi trattavano da eroe  di  guerra,  mi  facevano  il  saluto
    militare  ovunque  andassi.   Nessuno sa quanta strada possa
    fare in questo mondo chi  e'  pronto a squartare le pance di
    pochi ragazzini tedeschi.  Oltre ai fantocci francesi e alle
    puttane, i caffe' rigurgitavano anche di bolscevichi, e devo
    ammettere che mi pareva le loro idee avessero senso; per  lo
    meno,  lo  avevano  dopo  il  quarto  bicchiere  di  Chateau
    d'Yquem.  Dopo Cantigny, col metallo che volava da per tutto
    e  Alvin  Platt  che  se  ne  andava  in giro con un moncone
    sanguinolento strillando "Mamma!",  avevo cominciato a pormi
    le stesse domande dei bolscevichi.  Tipo:  "Ma  perche'  poi
    stiamo  facendo  questa guerra?" Quando raccontai che la mia
    famiglia era povera,  i  bolscevichi  si eccitarono.  Non mi
    ero mai sentito cosi' importante  da  quando  l'esercito  mi
    aveva  accettato.   Arrivai  addirittura  a regalare qualche
    franco a quei ragazzi,  e  quelli  mi iscrissero subito come
    sottufficiale alla loro organizzazione.  Cosi' adesso  avevo
    due  gradi:  soldato semplice scelto nel Corpo di Spedizione
    Americano   e   caporale    onorario   nella   Confraternita
    Internazionale dei Veterani  Proletari  o  come  diavolo  si
    facevano chiamare.

      La terza sera del mio giro di casini finii a discutere con
    una delle pollastre.  Fifi' (le chiamavo tutte Fifi') decise
    di  avermi  fatto  un servizietto speciale al nostro secondo
    round, qualcosa che aveva a  che  fare  con la sua bocca, la
    sua bouche, e adesso voleva venti franchi invece dei  soliti
    dieci.   Quelle  signore  pensavano che ogni fante americano
    fosse fatto di soldi.   A  Bar-le-Duc non sentivi dire altro
    che "les Americains, beaucoup d'argent." "Dix francs" dissi.
    "Vingt" insistette Fifi'.  I suoi occhi parevano due lumache
    morte.  I suoi capelli avevano il  colore  dello  sterco  di
    vacca.   "Dix." "Vingt.  O dico alla polizia militare che mi
    hai stupata" minaccio' Fifi'.   Parlava un inglese schifoso.
    Voleva dire stuprata.  "Dix" dissi io,  gettando  le  monete
    sul  letto;  e  a quel punto, Fifi' annuncio' con un sorriso
    storto di avere "un  brutto  caso  di malattia venerea" e di
    sperare di avermela attaccata.

      Ricordatevi, voi non c'eravate.  Il vostro corpo  non  era
    pieno di metallo, e non avevate lo scolo di Fifi', e nessuno
    si  aspettava  che  si  dovessero  fare  distinzioni  troppo
    sottili   tra  i  ragazzi  che  si  arrendevano  e  andavano
    baionettati e le pollastre  mangiarane che invece no.  C'era
    caldo.  Il petto mi faceva male.  Meta' dei miei amici erano
    morti per conquistare un piscio di villaggio con  le  strade
    fatte  di  cacca di cavallo.  E io non vedevo altro che quei
    bastardi di  germi  dello  scolo  che  rosicchiavano  i miei
    organi preferiti.  Il mio Remington  era  appoggiato  vicino
    alla  porta.  La baionetta adesso era tinta, aveva il colore
    delle rape; cosi'  diversa  dalla  guerra, quella baionetta,
    col suo scopo indiscutibile.   La  infilai  dentro  Fifi'  e
    ascoltai  il  grattare dell'acciaio contro la sua pelvi.  Se
    aveva intenzione  di  raccontare  alla  polizia militare che
    l'avevo stuprata, be', era stata accontentata.   Passai  per
    la  scala  antincendio.   Avevo  le  mani  bagnate  e calde.
    Mentre tornavo alla mia stanza, continuai a sentirmi mordere
    le budella, come mi  avessero  gassato.  Avrei preferito non
    essermi  mai  alzato  in  punta  di  piedi  al   centro   di
    reclutamento.    Una   canzoncina   mi   aiuto'.   Dopo  sei
    ritornelli  e  una  bottiglia   di   cognac,  alla  fine  mi
    addormentai.

    Mademoiselle di Bar-le-Duc, parlez-vous?
    Mademoiselle di Bar-le-Duc, parlez-vous?
    La mademoiselle di Bar-le-Duc
    Ti scopera' tutto d'un coup.
    Bella figliola, parlez-vous?

    Il sedici luglio salii su una tradotta militare e  raggiunsi
    il  mio  reggimento,  adesso  attestato lungo la Marna.  Li'
    c'era gia'  stata  una  grossa  battaglia,  in  un  giorno o
    nell'altro del '14, e si sperava in un'altra.   Ero  proprio
    contento  di  lasciare  Bar-le-Duc,  nonostante tutte le sue
    meraviglie  e  piaceri.   La  gendarmeria  del  posto, avevo
    sentito, stava indagando sulla  faccenda  di  Fifi'.   Clic,
    clic,  toc,  toc,  toc.   Il mio guardiano si ferma, ventuno
    secondi.  Marcia verso sud sul sentiero nero.  Alla Marna mi
    affidarono una mitragliatrice Hotchkiss, e io la sistemai su
    una collina di fango, per coprire meglio la trincea avanzata
    in cui avevano sistemato  il  mio  plotone.  Avevo due buoni
    amici in quel buco, e cosi' quando il  capitano  Mallery  si
    presento'  con gli ordini del general (adesso facevamo parte
    del XX  Corpo  d'Armata  Francese)  e  mi  disse  che dovevo
    spostare  piu'  in  giu'  di  un  chilometro  e   mezzo   la
    mitragliatrice, io persi la testa.

      "Quei  ragazzi  sono completamente esposti" protestai.  La
    robaccia che avevo in petto era  in fiamme.  "Se ci sara' un
    attacco della fanteria,  li  perderemo  tutti."  "Sposta  la
    Hotchkiss,  soldato  semplice  Johnson"  disse  il capitano.
    "Non e' un'idea molto buona" dissi io.  "Spostala." "Saranno
    nudi come uccellini." "Spostala.  Adesso." Un paio di guerre
    piu' tardi,  naturalmente,  gli  attacchi  agli ufficiali da
    parte dei loro uomini hanno raggiunto quasi la  dignita'  di
    una  forma d'arte (so tutto di queste cose; mi piace leggere
    i giornali dei turisti), ma  era  il  1918 e il concetto era
    ancora allo stadio infantile.  Di certo non diedi  prova  di
    grande  raffinatezza  quando  estrassi la mia Colt e, in uno
    sforzo pionieristico, perforai il  cuore di Mallery.  Fu una
    cosa piuttosto rozza.

      E  poi,  porca  miseria,  chi ti salta fuori?  L'ufficiale
    comandante  in  persona,   il  vecchio  coriaceo  colonnello
    Horrocks, con gli occhi a bitorzolo per l'incredulita'.   Mi
    disse  che  ero  in  arresto.   Mi  disse  che  mi avrebbero
    impiccato.  A quel  punto  ero  stufo  marcio.  Stufo marcio
    della paura dei gas e  di  Alvin  Platt  che  si  era  visto
    saltare  in  aria  un  braccio.   Stufo  marcio di essere un
    soldato semplice della  fanteria  americana  e un bolscevico
    onorario, stufo marcio di puttane avide e della  gonorrea  e
    di  tutta  la  stupida,  sanguinosa,  fetida  guerra.  Cosi_
    scappai.  Esatto: scappai,  battei  in  ritirata, lasciai il
    fronte occidentale.   Sfortunatamente,  presi  la  direzione
    sbagliata.  Volevo arrivare a Chateau- Thierry e nascondermi
    nei  bordelli  finche'  la  storia  di  Mallery non si fosse
    sgonfiata, invece mi trovai  diretto verso Cruccolandia.  Oh
    si', diritto verso le  linee  nemiche.   Che  stupido.   Che
    stupido.   Quando  mi  resi  conto  del mio errore, alzai le
    mani.  E urlai.  "Kamerad!  Kamerad!"

      Bill Johnson nato Wilbur Hines non ha mai combattuto nella
    Seconda  Battaglia  della  Marna.  Non ha mai aiutato il suo
    reggimento a  ricacciare  indietro  di  tredici chilometri i
    crucchi, a catturare quattromila dei  migliori  soldati  del
    Kaiser,  e  ucciderne  Dio  sa quanti altri.  Questo soldato
    semplice si  e'  perso  tutto,  perche'  i  crucchi lo hanno
    colpito  con  tutto  quello  che   avevano.    Raffiche   di
    mitragliatrice,  pistole,  fucili, shrapnel.  E' esplosa una
    granata.   Hanno  lanciato   il   gas.   Nome:  sconosciuto.
    Indirizzo: sconosciuto.  Carnagione:  carbonizzata.   Colore
    degli  occhi:  niente  occhi.  Capelli: bruciati.  Settimane
    piu' tardi, quando mi  hanno  raccattato dalla pianura della
    Marna, era  chiaro  che  ero  il  candidato  ideale  per  il
    programma   Arlington.    Per  mia  fortuna,  il  colonnello
    Horrocks si era fatto  uccidere  a Soissons.  Avrebbe votato
    contro di me.  Come dicevo,  leggo  i  giornali.   Mi  tengo
    informato.   E'  cosi'  che  ho  saputo  di  mio padre.  Una
    settimana dopo  il  mio  ingresso  in  questa scatola, Harry
    Hines ha barato a poker telesina e il tizio che aveva  perso
    lo  ha  spedito al creatore con un martello da muratore.  Ne
    ha parlato in prima pagina il Centre County Democrat.

      Sta piovendo.  I vecchi  aprono  gli ombrelli; i ragazzini
    delle medie si raccolgono attorno all'insegnante; i  lupetti
    marciano  via  come  un  plotone di nani.  Ho fame della mia
    vita?  Per molti anni,  si',  sono stato furibondo, poi sono
    arrivati gli ottanta, per me come per il secolo, e  mi  sono
    reso  conto  che  a  quel  punto sarei stato comunque morto.
    Cosi' non vi lascero'  con  pensieri amari.  Vi lascero' con
    una bella canzoncina.  Ascoltate.

    Mademoiselle di Ir-sur-Tille, parlez-vous?
    Mademoiselle di Ir-sur-Tille, parlez-vous?
    La mademoiselle di Ir-sur-Tille
    Corre a zig zag anche in april.
    Bella figliola, parlez-vous?

    Il mio guardiano si ferma, rivolto a est.

            *@{i}Una vecchia fiaba raccontata ancora una volta@{ui}*

                          @{i}by Alessio Saltarin@{ui}
 
                                 
     Questa storia  ebbe  inizio  nell'anno  1200,  in una terra
    verde e pianeggiante attraversata da un fiume le  cui  acque
    scorrevano  impetuose  e  ricche  di  pesci.   Il  fiume era
    chiamato Badia, e la  terra  "Valle  del  Badia", ma tutti i
    suoi abitanti la chiamavano semplicemente  Badia.   Nel  bel
    mezzo  della  valle  era  situato un immenso castello, dalle
    torri altissime e acute,  dalla  geometria tutta volta verso
    il cielo.  Li' vi abitava una giovane Principessa, Armerina,
    con la  sua  famiglia,  composta  dal  Re  Carlo,  detto  il
    Magnanimo  e  dalla  Regina  Consorte  Maria  Chiara,  detta
    l'Illuminata.   Era  una mattina soleggiata di Maggio.  Quel
    giorno gli abitanti della valle, che vivevano di pesca e dei
    frutti della terra resa  fertile  dal  fiume, videro in gran
    bella mostra, appeso nel mezzo della Piazza  del  paese,  un
    grande papiro sul quale era inciso il seguente messaggio:

                   Agli abitanti tutti della Badia
                    il Re Sua Altezza Serenissima
                     Carlo I detto Il Magnanimo
              volge un saluto et indirizza un appello:
              che nella data dei due prossimi tramonti
                   facciano presentia al Castello
               i maghi, i saggi e gli astrologhi tutti
                  i quali sieno chiamati a svelare,
                 interpretare e dichiarare il sogno
                  funesto che agita da sette notti
           il sonno della Principessa nostra unica figlia
                       l'amatissima Armerina.
                  Di questo sia data ampia notitia
                         et resa pubblicita'.

     Potete  immaginare  il gran parapiglia che questo messaggio
    getto' fra le  genti,  che  infatti  non  fecero che parlare
    della cosa per tutto il giorno.  Aggravo'  la  questione  il
    fatto  che  ormai  era  quasi un anno che la Principessa non
    appariva in pubblico e  si  temeva  fosse  malata.  - Ecco -
    dicevano i maligni - sta morendo.  - Fu dunque nel mezzo  di
    queste  polemiche  che  si svolse in gran segreto l'incontro
    con i saggi.  Ad  uno  ad  uno costoro vennero mandati nella
    camera della fanciulla,  che  aveva  visto  sino  ad  allora
    quattordici  primavere.   Dopo  che  ciascuno  di essi si fu
    fatto raccontare il sogno, si  riunirono tutti in una stanza
    per decidere il da farsi.  Quando ebbero finito, il capo dei
    Maghi, Taruk-Al-Assan che veniva dal paese dei Turchi, cosi'
    si rivolse alla Maesta' Serenissima: - Stimato  Sovrano,  Vi
    debbo  riferire una notizia funesta.  Io e i miei colleghi a
    lungo abbiamo disquisito  e  abbiamo  dato fondo alle nostre
    esoteriche conoscenze.  Il nostro verdetto e' pero' unanime,
    giacché il sogno della Principessa ha un senso che non  puo'
    esser   equivocato.    Si   tratta   infatti   di  un  sogno
    divinatorio, che la  Provvidenza  Vi  manda  per metterVi in
    guardia.  L'evento che si prospetta  e'  questo:  verra'  un
    giovane, che le Vostre Regali Maesta' non possono conoscere,
    che  rapira' il cuore della Principessa e la lascera' in una
    tristezza inconsolabile.  Infine,  presa dalla disperazione,
    Ella fuggira' e Voi non la rivedrete  mai  piu'.   -  Questo
    disse  il  capo  dei  Maghi,  lasciando  il  Re  e la Regina
    naturalmente sconsolati.  -  Non  si  puo'  andare contro il
    Destino - diceva la Regina, ma il Re non ne  voleva  sapere.
    -  Faremo di tutto perché non incontri nessuno.  E' giovane,
    ha tutta  la  vita  davanti.   Non  possiamo  permettere che
    qualcuno la rensa infelice.  - Intanto anche nella valle  si
    era  sparsa  la notizia e la gente era assai dispiaciuta per
    quanto il sogno aveva  svelato.   Bisogna infatti sapere che
    nell'anno mille e duecento nessuno metteva in discussione  i
    Maghi,  che alle volte facevano il bello e il cattivo tempo.
    Infatti il loro potente  capo, Taruk-Al-Assan, gia' da tempo
    mirava  a  conquistare  la  giovanissima  Principessa:  egli
    sapeva infatti che se  fosse  riuscito  a  sposarla  avrebbe
    potuto  mettere  le  mani  su uno dei tesori piu' immensi di
    tutta Europa, quello  appunto  del  Re  Carlo  I,  di cui si
    favoleggiava, ma nulla si  conosceva  con  certezza.   -  Mi
    sposo  la smorfiosetta - diceva il terribile Taruk - e saro'
    l'uomo piu' potente del mondo.   - La sorte sembrava volgere
    dalla sua, poiché infatti  il  Re  chiuse  nel  castello  la
    Principessa  Armerina  e le vieto' anche solamente di vedere
    chiunque  non  fosse  della   famiglia.   Fu  cosi'  che  la
    tristezza profetizzata dal sogno divenne realta', ma per  un
    motivo  ben  diverso  da quello previsto: Armerina era sola,
    non conosceva il mondo e  rimaneva  per ore nella sua stanza
    regale, in solitudine, a sfogliare i  libri  che  rubava  di
    nascosto dall' enorme biblioteca del castello, e a sospirare
    per le vicende d'amore di cui leggeva.

     In  un  regno  assai lontano dalla Badia, vicino alle Alpi,
    viveva  un  mercante  d'erbe  medicinali.   Questo  mercante
    soleva fare il giro delle citta' vendendo le sue erbe a caro
    prezzo, ma non era disonesto.   Egli infatti aveva girato il
    mondo per procurarsi quelle erbe, ed aveva a lungo  studiato
    per  poter  conoscere  le  virtu'  medicinali di ciascuna di
    esse.  Era costui dunque  molto  ricercato, ed aveva con gli
    anni accumulato una discreta ricchezza.  Il  mercante  aveva
    un  figlio  che si chiamava Aldebrando.  Nonostante la buona
    volonta' del padre, Aldebrando  era  pigro e aveva sempre la
    testa tra le nuvole.  Non ne voleva sapere  di  studiare  le
    erbe,  il  commercio lo infastidiva, e aveva la passione dei
    libri,  che  comprava  di   nascosto  dal  padre  presso  un
    monastero li' vicino.  Accadde un bel  giorno  che,  durante
    una  di  queste  sue peregrinazioni al monastero, Aldebrando
    trovasse per strada un  oggetto  piuttosto strano.  Era come
    una  pietra,  ma  piu'  morbido,  e  trasparente,  ma  quasi
    annerito.  Assomigliava ad un pezzo d'ambra, ma la forma era
    irregolare e frastagliata.  Quest'oggetto era conservato  in
    un  panno  di  maglia  su  cui  v'erano  apposte le seguenti
    lettere: TARAS.

     Siccome Aldebrando nelle sue  letture  aveva  saputo  degli
    oggetti  magici che vengono dalle Indie, subito lo riconobbe
    come  tale  ed  accuratamente  lo  ripose  nel  suo fagotto.
    Tornato a casa si rese conto che era molto presto e  che  il
    padre  non  sarebbe tornato che per l'ora di cena.  Indosso'
    un pigiama di  lini  coloratissimi  che  il  padre gli aveva
    portato dalla Turchia e si mise  a  giocare  con  lo  strano
    oggetto  che  somigliava  all'ambra  ed a fantasticare su di
    esso: da dove  potesse  venire,  quale  fosse la sua storia,
    quali i suoi poteri.  Mentre era immerso in questi pensieri,
    Aldebrando stava seduto in una grande  cesta  che  il  padre
    aveva  usato  un  tempo per raccogliervi delle erbe.  Ebbene
    accadde  che  per  caso  il  giovane  si  mise  a strofinare
    l'oggetto misterioso e capito'  una  cosa  stupefacente:  la
    cesta volava.  Aldebrando fu colto dapprima dal terrore, poi
    provo'  e  riprovo': ogni volta che strofinava quella specie
    di ambra la cesta volava,  tornava  a strofinarla e la cesta
    morbidamente atterrava.  Era talmente preso dallo stupore  e
    dalla  meraviglia  che si dimentico' persino di scrivere una
    lettera d'addio al padre, perché  in  men che non si dica si
    trovo' lontanissimo dalla sua casa.  Aldebrando, con in mano
    il magico talismano, prese a volare sempre  piu'  lontano  e
    sempre  piu'  in  alto.   Arrivo'  a toccare le nuvole e poi
    ancora piu' in alto, fin  sopra  quelle nuvole dove il cielo
    e' di cobalto e la superficie un morbido  batuffolo  bianco.
    Allora  si tuffava nuovamente dentro le nuvole e sempre piu'
    in basso.  Alle volte  incontrava  piogge e tempeste, ma gli
    bastava risalire sopra le nuvole per ritrovare  la  calda  e
    rassicurante  luce  del  sole.   Fu  cosi' che, anche spinto
    dalla fame, Aldebrando decise  alfine di atterrare e capito'
    proprio nella  Badia.   La  sua  apparizione  fu  un  evento
    indescrivibile:  la  gente correva impazzita e terrorizzata,
    ma anche incuriosita.

     Dicevano: - E' sceso dal cielo il dio dei Turchi -, per via
    del suo strano abbigliamento.   Il  giovane era divertito da
    tutta questa considerazione e  decise  di  stare  al  gioco,
    stando  anche  bene  attento  a nascondere il suo talismano.
    Entro' in una taverna  e  chiese  di che rifocillarsi: nulla
    gli  fu  negato,  ed  anzi  fu  trattato  proprio  come  una
    divinita'.  - Sapete - gli disse l'oste - qui nella Badia un
    evento funesto ci rovina i giorni.   La  famiglia  reale  e'
    triste  come  se  fosse  in lutto.  Alla giovane principessa
    infatti e' stato predetto che sarebbe stata infelice per via
    di un giovane, ed ora ella  e' chiusa nella sua stanza e non
    puo' vedere nessuno.   -  Aldebrando,  curioso  per  natura,
    promise che avrebbe fatto qualcosa e si fece indicare la via
    per  il castello.  - Non puo' sbagliare - gli rispose l'oste
    - sono le guglie piu'  alte  del regno - Cosi' Aldebrando si
    mise in viaggio nella sua  cesta  volante  e,  raggiunto  il
    castello,  entro' dalla finestra della torre piu' alta.  Era
    la camera della principessa Armerina, che stava dormendo nel
    suo letto.  Era cosi' bella  e  in una posizione cosi' dolce
    che egli non poté fare a meno di baciarla.   La  principessa
    si  sveglio'  e  fu  molto  spaventata.   - Chi sei ?  - gli
    chiese.  - Dicono che  io  sia  il  dio dei Turchi - rispose
    Aldebrando - E perché mai?  - E allora il giovane  strofino'
    il talismano e la cesta si alzo' in volo e lo raggiunse.

     - Chiedo scusa, signor dio dei Turchi - disse Armerina - ma
    lei  mi  ha  molto  spaventata  -  -  Oh,  non  deve  essere
    spaventata  Altezza  -  le  disse  Aldebrando  e comincio' a
    raccontarle delle storie  meravigliose.  Le racconto' storie
    in cui il viso di lei era una valle di neve ed i suoi  occhi
    erano laghi oscuri e bellissimi.  Le racconto' dei pesci che
    vi  vivevano,  che  si  chiamavano Pensieri, e dell'onda che
    muoveva le sue labbra, che  si chiamava Poesi'a.  E' inutile
    dire  che  Armerina  si  innamoro'  follemente  del  giovane
    Aldebrando, e che anch'egli perse la testa per la dolcissima
    principessa.  In breve decisero di sposarsi.  - Deve  venire
    a trovarmi la prossima settimana, signor dio, cosicché possa
    presentarla ai miei genitori.  Saranno cosi' contenti che mi
    sposo con il dio dei Turchi!  - e cosi' si salutarono con un
    lungo  bacio  e  Aldebrando  scomparve  nel  modo in cui era
    venuto: volando  per  la  finestra  sulla  cesta  delle erbe
    medicinali.   Prima  di  prendere  alloggio   e   andare   a
    riposarsi,  Aldebrando  decise  di fare un giro in paese per
    sentire che aria tirava.  La  gente  era estasiata ed il dio
    dei Turchi era l'argomento su tutte le bocche.

     Siccome Aldebrando si era comprato dei vestiti piu' normali
    ed aveva ben nascosto la sua cesta poté girare per le strade
    non essendo riconosciuto.  - Io l'ho visto - diceva un  tipo
    coi baffi a scimitarra - e' alto almeno tre metri, ed ha gli
    occhi fiammeggianti.  - - Vola su di un vero tappeto volante
    -  gli  faceva eco un altro - e le sue vesti sono tempestate
    di rubini e  di  diamanti  -  -  Ha  una  barba - diceva una
    signora - azzurra come l'acqua del mare e la pelle e'  color
    dell'oliva!   -  Oh,  erano  tali  e  tante  le  cose che si
    dicevano che  non  basterebbe  un  libro  a  contenerle.  Ma
    arrivo' dunque il giorno in cui Aldebrando dovette di  nuovo
    presentarsi  al  castello.   A bordo della sua cesta, entro'
    per  le  vetrate  del  salone  dei  ricevimenti,  provocando
    l'incommensurabile meraviglia  del  casato  reale.  Anche il
    suo bel pigiama turco, devo dire,  faceva  il  suo  effetto.
    Egli  atterro'  di  fianco alla principessa, che lo guardava
    con due occhi pienissimi d'amore.   Gli  fu offerto un te' e
    poi si misero tutti a  chiacchierare.   Siccome  il  giovane
    Aldebrando era abbastanza spiritoso, presto il clima divenne
    confidenziale  e la regina prese a dargli persino del tu.  -
    E adesso,  Aldebrando,  perché  non  ci  racconti  una bella
    fiaba?  Armerina dice che sei bravissimo a raccontarne.  - E
    cosi' egli si mise a narrare:

     "C'era una  volta  una  piccola  sogliola,  che si chiamava
    Billa.  Billa era molto curiosa, amava vagare per  il  mare,
    amava  la  liberta'.  Un giorno capita nei pressi di Rufo il
    Tartufo.  Costui era  un  brutto  e  vecchio frutto di mare,
    sempre attaccato alla  sua  roccia,  sempre  introverso.   -
    Bella  gioventu'!   -  dice  sarcastico  a Billa.  - Oh, non
    l'avevo vista, signor Rufo, buongiorno - rispose educata.  -
    Tutti uguali, voi giovani, sempre  di fretta.  E intanto non
    cercate mai di capire la vita,  di  porvi  delle  domande  -
    osservo'  il  tartufo.   -  Lei  mi  sorprende, signor Rufo,
    davvero crede che dovrei  fermarmi  a riflettere?  - - Certo
    che no, cara ragazza!  Non sia mai, lei ha  una  vita  molto
    comoda,  dopotutto.   Si  e'  mai  chiesta  perché  nuotare?
    Perché  gioire  sguaiatamente nella sabbia?  - - No!  Non ci
    ho mai pensato.  L'ho  fatto  perché  cosi' sentivo di fare,
    perché l'acqua era cosi' fresca, la  sabbia  cosi'  morbida:
    nuotavo,  mi  insabbiavo, vivevo insomma.  Sentivo in me una
    forza, una felicita' grande,  nuova,  una vera gioia...  - -
    Fortunata, non c'e' che dire - -  Ma  sempre  meno  di  lei,
    signor  Rufo,  lei  che e' dotato di un cosi' gran cervello,
    che le permette  pensieri  cosi'  profondi!  Vedra', prima o
    poi stupira' il mondo - - Ma chi se ne  importa  del  mondo,
    carina.   Io  mi chiudo nel mio guscio e chi s'e' visto s'e'
    visto.  Il mondo non mi  tocca,  ci  sono  solo io ed il mio
    guscio, ed e' abbastanza - e cosi'  dicendo,  senza  nemmeno
    salutare, si rinchiuse nel guscio e spari'.  Billa rimase un
    po'  interdetta, poi diede colpo di coda ed ando' a tuffarsi
    di nuovo sotto la sabbia.  E nella sabbia penso': - E' molto
    triste la vita per il signor Rufo -

     COSI' SI CONCLUDE CODESTA STORIA DI MARE
     CON LA SOGLIOLA BILLA NELLA SABBIA A GIOCARE
     E SE PROPRIO UNA FINE BISOGNA INVENTARE
     E' QUELLA DI RUFO CHE NELLA ROCCIA SCOMPARE.
     LA MORALE POI, TROVATEVELA VOI."

     - Oh, e' una storia cosi'  commovente - disse la Regina con
    le lacrime agli occhi.  - E' una  storia  davvero  profonda,
    Aldebrando - disse Armerina.  - E non senza una certa ironia
    -  aggiunse  il  Re.   Fu  quindi decisa all'istante la data
    delle nozze  ed  i  Regali  Consorti  lasciarono  soli i due
    innamorati,  solo  con  un'ultima   raccomandazione:   -   E
    Aldebrando  non  scordarti  di  fare  un  bel  volo,  quando
    arriverai   per   le  nozze:  i  nostri  avversari  politici
    rimarranno  senza  parole!   -  Finalmente  soli, Aldebrando
    prese con sé Armerina e le  disse  che  l'amava.   A  quelle
    parole  la  principessa si senti' felice come non lo era mai
    stata.   Disse:  -  Non  voglio  lasciarti  nemmeno  per  un
    momento.  -  Ma  arrivo'  il  tempo  del  congedo e Armerina
    decise di tenere con sé almeno un piccolo  ricordo  del  suo
    amore,  finché non l'avrebbe rivisto, il giorno delle nozze.
    Fu cosi' che, frugando nelle sue tasche, trovo' il talismano
    e se ne impossesso'.  Aldebrando non si accorse di nulla, ma
    ebbe come un presagio  e  le  disse:  -  Spero che niente ci
    possa separare.  - Uscito dal castello si  avvio'  a  grandi
    passi  verso  l'ostello  dove  alloggiava.  Giuntovi, con la
    cesta sottobraccio, si disse: -  E adesso volo da mio padre,
    per invitarlo alle nozze.  - Cerco' invano nelle  tasche  il
    talismano,  ma  non lo trovo'.  E senza di esso la cesta non
    volava.  Come  avrebbe  fatto  ora  a  sposare  Armerina, si
    chiese in preda al panico.  Per non parlare poi del Re,  che
    attendeva  la sua entrata a Palazzo in volo.  Fu proprio una
    disdetta.  Arrivo' il giorno delle nozze ed egli non si fece
    vedere.  La citta'  era  bardata  a festa, tutti attendevano
    l'eccezionale evento.  Il Re  aveva  invitato  dignitari  di
    corte  dei  piu' importanti paesi del mondo, la Regina aveva
    invitato   le   nobildonne   d'Europa.    Fu   un  clamoroso
    insuccesso.  A  mezzanotte,  gli  invitati  cominciarono  ad
    andarsene ed Armerina fu chiusa in camera sua, un po' perché
    era tardi, un po' per rabbia.

     Purtroppo  nessuno  conosce  con sicurezza come andarono le
    cose.  Si sa solo che  il  mattino seguente, Armerina non fu
    piu' trovata nella sua stanza.  Fu ritrovata  solamente  una
    strana, morbida pietra simile all'ambra, lasciata sul letto,
    accanto  ad  un  messaggio:  "Questo  e' il talismano TARAS,
    artefice della mia  felicita'  e  della  mia sventura".  Per
    quanti sforzi furono fatti, di Armerina non  si  seppe  piu'
    nulla.   Tanto  meno del supposto dio dei Turchi, il giovane
    Aldebrando.  Il  capo  dei  Maghi,  Taruk-Al-Assan,  dopo un
    periodo di comprensibile euforia, fu colto con le  mani  nel
    sacco  mentre  cercava  di  rubare  delle posate d'argento e
    giustiziato sulla Piazza  due  giorni  dopo.  La gente della
    Badia ha piano piano dimenticato, ma si sentono ancora  oggi
    strane   storie   su   un  giovane  che  avrebbe  rapito  la
    principessa quella notte, e  che  i due fossero scappati per
    un'isola in mezzo al mare, dove hanno vissuto i loro  giorni
    felici  e  contenti.  Quanto al talismano, infine, si sa che
    fece parte del  Tesoro  della  Corona  del Regno della Badia
    finché Napoleone non lo rubo' e ne fece collane per  le  sue
    ammiratrici.  Il talismano, non essendo una pietra preziosa,
    fu   relegato  in  un  angolo  e  dimenticato.   Fu  un  mio
    progenitore a raccoglierlo  ed  a metterlo nell'involucro di
    seta in cui e' attualmente riposto, con la dicitura: "Taras,
    o il talismano della Badia".

       E ora mentre scrivo e' qui davanti ai  miei  occhi.   Per
    quanto  abbia cercato di strofinarlo, nessuna cesta, finora,
    si e' mai alzata in volo.

                     "@{b}SHE SMOKED A MEAN CIGARETTE@{ub}"

                             @{i}by Robb Allan@{ui}


      As  I  entered  the school yard, I saw her standing beside
    the building smoking a cigarette.  Her long red hair shining
    in the  glow  of  the  street  light.   She  shook  her head
    violently as if  having  a  grand  mal  seizure.   Her  hair
    flipped to hang from the other side of her head.  I marveled
    at  her ability to move all that hair without ever having to
    touch it.  I approached  her,  intending to bum a cigarette.
    "Hey, babe, is that a Marlboro in your  mouth,  or  are  you
    wishing  you  could have my Marlboro?" "Fuck off, you little
    dweeb!"

      I knew right then that it was going  to  be  a  love  hate
    relationship.   You may be saying to yourself, she just told
    you to fuck off,  you  moron,  there is no relationship, but
    that's where you're wrong.  She was smiling as she said  it,
    so I pushed a little harder.

      "Why don't you and I  go  in  and have ourselves a dance?"
    "Sure you got enough Oxy to keep those zits out  of  sight?"
    "I  don't use Oxy, baby, I use Clerasil.  And, yes, I have a
    whole tube." She left her  perch  along the wall and took me
    by the arm, "Let's go, hon." I  heard  the  DJ  announce  my
    favorite  song,  "This  next one is for lovers, baby, 'Don't
    Stop Believin'" Steve Perry's voice filled the cafeteria, as
    we began our dance.  About  halfway through she whispered in
    my ear, causing my Marlboro to ignite.  I didn't  care  what
    she  was  saying,  'cuz I couldn't hear her, but the rush of
    her breath in my ear was making me horny.

      She looked at me  as  the  song  ended.  I believe she was
    actually looking through me.  I didn't  speak  for  a  long,
    cool  minute.   She  continued to stare.  "What the fuck are
    you starin' at me for?" I  said, the fingers of my left hand
    danced upon my skull, as I adjusted my glasses.  "You didn't
    hear a word I said did you, pimple boy?" "All I felt was you
    blowin' in my ear like hurricane Andrew." "I said, just  how
    much  fuckin'  money  do  you  have?"  She  produced another
    cigarette and lit it.  The picture was all too clear.  I had
    picked up a teenage  hooker.   But  my  values, or morals or
    whatever were not as far advanced as my  tongue,  "About  30
    bucks."  "Well,  you can get a blowjob for 25, but I want to
    suck it all out of you." As she said this, she ran her index
    finger along the front of her jeans, up her stomach, through
    the valley, stopping  at  her  lips.   Her  soft pink tongue
    flicked out and took a swipe at whatever she had  picked  up
    along the way.  "I'll tell you what.  For thirty bucks, I'll
    swallow."

      My Marlboro jumped and took  a  long  drag off my Fruit Of
    The Loom's....  Every payday, she would come  to  my  house,
    collect her thirty bucks, and inhale all the tobacco I could
    cram  in her mouth.  After graduation, I tired of the weekly
    slobjobs.  I  wanted  more  from  our  relationship.  All my
    friends were getting married, and I wanted a  normal  lover.
    I  spoke to Cyndi about it, and she was willing to give it a
    shot.  She said she felt  that  fate had intervened when her
    pimp, Johnboy, skipped  town,  and  that  returning  to  her
    former lifestyle would be like spitting in fate's soup.

      Then,  about  a  month after the birth of our child, Cyndi
    wacked out.  I had just put  the baby to bed and was sitting
    down to watch Jeopardy, when she came up  behind  the  chair
    and  kicked it.  The steel tip of her cowboy boots kissed my
    spine, catapulting me  into  Alex  Trebek's  face.  I gently
    removed my bloody face from  the  intestines  of  the  Sony,
    fearing  further injury.  My back was playing "Bitch School"
    by Spinal Tap.  My face bled profusely, but I didn't seem to
    notice, "What the fuck is  running  through that pea pod you
    call a brain, you ho!" "I'm so fuckin' tired of your sittin'
    around all night.  Ever since we moved in together  all  you
    do is drink, scratch, and fart!" "Is that any reason to drop
    kick  me through the TV.  Dammit!  I think you killed Alex!"
    The anger rushed out of  her  face, puddling at her feet.  A
    single tear rolled down her cheek,  "I'm  sorry,  Gideon,  I
    didn't  mean  to  hurt  you.   I  just  want you to pay more
    attention to me."

      If I had said what was  on  my mind, 'Well, bitch, you got
    my attention, now, what are you  gonna  do  with  it?',  the
    fight  would have continued, but I played along for the time
    being.   "It's  alright,  babe,   you  just  need  a  little
    counseling for that temper 'o yours." I pulled her  head  up
    against  my  shoulder with my left hand, gently stroking her
    long red hair with  my  right;  "Why  don't you sit down and
    collect your thoughts.  I'll go get us a couple'a beers."  I
    went  into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator, prepared
    to let this episode pass.   Dragging it out would only serve
    to piss her off, possibly sending me down a flight of stairs
    instead of through a TV.  I thought about just  walking  out
    the  door,  but I was not prepared to go looking for another
    woman.  In  my  mind,  I  knew  that  no  one  could smoke a
    cigarette like she could.

      Then I found the empty  carton.   It  had  once  contained
    twelve  shiny  cans  of  Coors, but now it stood as empty as
    Cyndi's thick skull.  I  snapped.  Suddenly it didn't matter
    that she smoked a good cigarette, with the enthusiasm  of  a
    pervert  in an all-you-can-eat porno shop.  It didn't matter
    that when my Marlboro shot  long  tendrils of smoke into her
    gaping maw, she would scream my  name  at  the  top  of  her
    lungs.  All that mattered was that she drank every last drop
    of  liquid  gold.   "Honey,"  She  said uncertainly from the
    living room, "is there  a  problem?"  The tidalwave that had
    battered my mind, receded into a calm pool of slightly foggy
    thoughts.  I grabbed the cleaver,  the  waters  in  my  mind
    again  came  to life, bubbling and churning.  Abandoning all
    sane thought, I rushed  into  the  living  room and sunk the
    cleaver deep into her skull.  It  split  open,  spraying  me
    with  blood.  Once again mired in foggy thoughts, my stomach
    was gripped by nausea.  I  felt  my gorge rising, and turned
    to rush into the bathroom, but instead ran  head  long  into
    Johnboy.  The force of impact nearly knocked us both down.

      He  tried  to  grab  me,  but  he was off balance, and his
    fingers closed  on  empty  air.   Regaining balance, Johnboy
    lunged for the cleaver.  He didn't have a chance to  rip  it
    from Cyndi's ruined skull.  I kicked his pack of cigarettes,
    and he doubled over, clutching himself as if I'd snuffed his
    fire  in  an  ashtray.   I  managed to retrieve the cleaver;
    swung it at Johnboy's  head.   He  dropped  to the floor and
    kicked my kneecap.  Next thing I knew, Johnboy was on top of
    me...  "Freeze!" The policeman yelled from the door.  I  had
    been  too  busy to hear the sirens approach.  I felt a pinch
    and heard gunshots.  The  room  changed colors, Blue, white,
    red, green, black....  Officer Geary looked at Connery,  his
    face  the  color  of a maggot.  Then he returned his gaze to
    the bodies on the floor.   The  one dressed in a white suit,
    purple fedora, and a gaudy gold chain, was not moving.

      The  other,  however,  twitched  uncontrollably,  and  the
    screaming was just too much for Geary.  He rushed out of the
    apartment vomiting on the small lawn bordering  the  parking
    lot.   Geary's partner knelt beside him, "You alright, man?"
    "Yeah, I think so."  Connery  started  to  get up, but Geary
    reached out and grabbed his wrist.  "Con?  Man, do you think
    they'll be able to re-attach it?" "It  doesn't  matter  now,
    man.   Even  if  they could, the scar on his neck would turn
    all the women off."

                      "@{b}LA PARTITA DEL COLONNELLO@{ub}"

                           @{i}by Enzo Verrengia@{ui}


     Lo shuttle  a  velocita'  di  fuga,  investito  dalla  luce
    solare, sembrava la punta aurea di un freccia scoccata verso
    le  stelle.   -Un'estorsione  a  gravita'  zero- sospiro' il
    pilota.  -L'ideale  per  la  pubblicita' della Corporazione.
    Quello  seduto  accanto,  in  penombra,  diede  uno   scatto
    smorzato all'arma che aveva appena finito di controllare.  E
    fu la sua replica.  -Di', perché ti chiamano Colonnello?- Il
    pilota  era  petulante.   -Nella  Corporazione  non  ci sono
    gradi, solo iniziativa e  voglia  di arrivare sempre piu' in
    alto.  L'altro  si  sporse  in  avanti.   I  riflessi  della
    strumentazione  gli  disegnarono sul viso spettrali tatuaggi
    di luce, accentuandone il profilo angoloso e massiccio.  -Tu
    che ne pensi?- fece  di  rimando,  girandosi di scatto dalla
    parte del pilota.

     Quest'ultimo esito', aggredito  dallo  sguardo  feroce:  -A
    ognuno  il  nome  che  si  merita.  Con quella abbronzatura,
    sarai un veterano di  qualche  fottuta  guerra in quei posti
    dove il sole picchia sul serio.  Altro silenzio, aggiunto  a
    quello  della  cabina  e  a  quello  piu' inviolabile che si
    estendeva fuori all'infinito.   -E  se  facessero saltare in
    aria con bel botto nucleare la stazione,  quelli  che  hanno
    preso gli ostaggi e il Virus Irreversibile?

     Il Colonnello emise un sospiro che somigliava a un ringhio:
    -Creperebbe  anche del personale altamente specializzato che
    la  Corporazione  vuole  tenere  in  vita  il  piu'  a lungo
    possibile.  Inoltre, non sarebbe facile spiegare  il  perché
    di una misura cosi' estrema, senza far venir fuori la storia
    del Virus Irreversibile.  Ufficialmente quassu' si producono
    miracoli  per  il progresso dell'umanita'.  Una serie di bip
    riporto' l'attenzione del pilota  sul pannello comandi.  -Ci
    siamo-   borbotto'.    -Inizio   sequenza   di   approccio.-
    L'annuncio venne da una donna che non esisteva, se non  come
    campionatura  vocale.  Nello spazio si profilo' la stazione,
    a forma di ruota  frattale.   Lo  shuttle mirava al perno di
    rotazione, adeguandosi al  movimento  come  uno  squalo  che
    prende  a  rigirarsi su se stesso.  Il Colonnello si infilo'
    il casco: -Grazie del  passaggio.   Io  scendo qui.  -Ma gli
    ordini_ -Nella Corporazione non ci sono gradi, ricordi?-  Il
    Colonnello  gli  concesse  un  sorriso.  -Solo iniziativa, e
    voglia di arrivare sempre  piu'  in  alto.  Siamo arrivati a
    qualche centi naio di miglia di altezza, e ora  l'iniziativa
    la prendo io.  Prosegui nella traiettoria di approccio e fa'
    come  se  non  sa pessi neanche della mia esistenza.- Pigio'
    sul tastierino alfanumerico da  polso,  e un attimo dopo era
    sparito  in  un  caleidoscopio  di  luci.   Le  stesse   che
    riflettendosi  dalla  strumenta  zione  fino  a poc'anzi gli
    avevano tatutato il volto.

     -Ehi_-balbetto' il pilota.   -Mai  vista una tuta stealth?-
    risuono' la voce fredda del Colonnello dall'impianto  radio.
    Il  caleidoscopio  di luci delineava un vago contorno umano.
    -Lo  strato  esterno   e'   un'intercapedine  trasparente  e
    schermata contro i raggi solari in cui  si  e'  immesso  del
    metallo  allo  stato  liquido  che  riflette alla perfezione
    l'esterno.  Come il mercurio,  ma  con un assetto molecolare
    ancora piu' efficace.  Sono uno specchio vivente.   -Possono
    sempre  scoprirti  con  i sensori.  -La schermatura cancella
    anche i miei segnali organici  e  i getti della tuta vengono
    raffreddati al momento dell'espulsione.  -Ma come farai tu a
    rilevare i loro segnali?  Se ti  interfacci  con  i  sistemi
    video   della  stazione,  ti  individuerranno  dall'interno.
    -Letture  all'infrarosso  e  altri  sensori  mi  arrivano su
    frequenze in codice da un satellite  di  sorveglianza  della
    Corporazione  di  cui  sanno solo pochi eletti.  Siamo tutti
    sotto gli occhi del  Consiglio di Amministrazione, purtroppo
    per quei dilettanti che ci hanno provato.  E la  lezione  di
    oggi  finisce qui.  Almeno per te.  Per loro comincia tra un
    po'.

     La  forma  riflettente   scomparve  nella  fusoliera  dello
    shuttle.  Il pilota,  spiazzato,  guardo'  il  quadrante  di
    segnalazione  delle aperture.  Per un attimo si oscuro' come
    per mancanza  di  alimentazione,  e  quando  si attivo' dava
    tutto ermeticamente chiuso.  Invece  una  figura  indistinta
    era  uscita  dallo  shuttle ed ora si protendeva dallo scafo
    sul fondale stellato.  O  meglio  era  il fondale stesso che
    pareva contorcesi e contrarsi.  Sotto, la Terra assisteva in
    silenzio col viso verdazzurro segnato  dalle  spirali  delle
    formazioni   nuvolose,   che  parevano  rughe  eterna  mente
    mutevoli.

     -Fatti riconoscere- gracchio' da uno schermo dello  shuttle
    la  faccia  deturpata  di  un demone.  -Volo 465- rispose il
    pilota.   -Sequenza  d'approccio   iniziata.   Mi  manda  la
    Corporazione.  -Senti, senti.  Arriva Babbo  Natale.   Spero
    che porti le ca ramelle, non il carbone, altrimenti facciamo
    piovere  laggiu'  un  bel  po'  di  Virus Irreversibile.  Il
    Colonnello  sentiva  tutto  nell'impianto  di  comunicazione
    della tuta stealth.  Aderiva  al  dorso  dello shuttle con i
    tamponi magnetici dei guanti e  degli  stivali.   Guardo'  i
    raggi  della stazione che calavano in diagonale tra lui e lo
    spazio come  tronchi  distorti  di  una  foresta  morta.  Il
    movimento rallento' fino a perdersi del tutto, man mano  che
    la rotazione dello shuttle si adeguo' a quella del complesso
    orbitante.   La  distanza  si  accorciava  e ad un tratto le
    indecifrabili forme frattali della stazione furono a portata
    di mano.  Lo  shuttle  attraverso'  una  zona d'ombra creata
    dalla  posizione  del  sole,  dove  il  buio  era  assoluto.
    Adesso!

     Il Colonnello si stacco' dal dorso del velivolo e accese  i
    getti direzionali montati sulle sue spalle, e schermati come
    il  resto dall'intercapedine simile al mercurio.  Spicco' un
    balzo in avanti, e  alla  tecnologia si aggiunse qualcosa di
    primordiale, che lui aveva dentro.   Infine  approdo'  sulla
    superficie  della  stazione.   -Niente  scherzi  in  fase di
    atterraggio- continuava la  voce  del  demone, in radio.  Il
    Colonnello compose una sequenza numerica sul  tastierino  da
    polso  e  nel  casco  gli  apparve  una mappa della stazione
    orbitante  in   realta'   virtuale.    Con   una   serie  di
    verbalizzazioni sublabiali, l'uomo ottenne  una  successione
    di  ingrandimenti  dei  vari  settori.   Fino  a  quello che
    cercava.  -Nella cambusa- sussurro' fra sé.

     La mappa elettronica gli mostrava il settore  cucine  della
    stazione.   Gli  ostaggi  erano  accoccolati  sul pavimento,
    sotto il tiro di cinque uomini armati.  Un sesto, si muoveva
    frenetico.  Il sistema  di ricostruzione virtuale attribuiva
    a tutti le giuste fattezze, complete  di  nome  e  incarico.
    Quello in agitazione era il capotecnico, il cui nome, Fergus
    Clark  detto  Gus,  appariva  in sovrimpressione seguito dal
    curriculum.  La sua voce  deformata dalla tensione ricordava
    quella di un demone.  Il Colonnello inizio' a sfrecciare nel
    paesaggio frattale, con i getti  a  piena  potenza.   Un'ape
    silenziosa che conosceva la sua rotta fra travi e improvvisi
    spuntoni  metallici.   Anche  perché  il computer della tuta
    provvedeva a orientare il  sistema  propulsivo e a regolarne
    l'intensita'  per  mantenere  l'allineamento  relativo  alla
    stazione.  Finché non gli spararono addosso.

     -Non sei cosi' invisibile  come  credi!-  lo  canzono'  una
    seconda  voce dalla radio.  Il Colonello si tuffo' al riparo
    di un raggio  della  ruota  orbitante.   Altri proiettili lo
    inseguirono, sfiorandolo.  -Chi credi di essere?  A  destra.
    Il  Colonnello  stacco'  l'arma  dalla presa magnetica sulla
    tuta e si appiglio'  saldamente  alla parete della stazione,
    dopodiché apri' il fuoco.  Una  raffica  assolutamente  muta
    nel  vuoto  dello  spazio.  Il resto lo fecero i proiettili,
    con dispositivi d'ingaggio  del bersaglio.  Aggirarono tutti
    gli  ostacoli  che  si  paravano  tra  loro  e  l'obbiettivo
    organico.  Una forma goffa che fluttuava tra gli spuntoni di
    quella foresta frattale esplose in mille petali di  latta  e
    boccioli  purpurei.   I  resti  del  cadavere  formarono una
    sinistra costellazione in prossimita' della stazione.

     -Nella  prossima  vita  ricordati  di  tenere  attivate  le
    contromisure- commento'  il  Colonnello.   Altri due seguaci
    del demone all'interno  della  stazione  lo  aspettavano  al
    varco  di una struttura di ponteggio.  Stavolta il vantaggio
    dell'ombra era andato a  loro.  -Lavori in corso- cantileno'
    una nuova voce nel casco del Colonnello.  -Lavori per la tua
    tomba- preciso' il secondo.   Avevano  gia'  sparato,  e  il
    Colonnello  fu  colpito, in una ma cabra replica del macello
    da lui stesso provocato  poc'anzi.  -Che sta succedendo, la'
    fuori?-  strillo'  il  demone  che  tirava  le  fila.    -La
    Corporazione  ha  barato-  rispose  uno  dei due che avevano
    affrontato il Colonnello.  -Ci hanno mandato addosso uno dei
    loro sbirri privati -  disse  l'altro.   -Che si divertiva a
    fare giochi di prestigio con la tuta.  Noi pero'  conosciamo
    il  trucco.-  Tocco'  una  specie  di  lampada tascabile sul
    calcio della sua arma,  il  cui  fascio sottilissimo di luce
    aveva  investito  il  Colonnello,  rivelandolo.   -Basta  un
    puntatore adatto.   -Ah  si'?-  commento'  il  demone  dalla
    stazione.   -D'accordo,  l'affare  salta.  Compresa la testa
    degli ostaggi.  Comincio dal pilota dello shuttle.  -Ehi, io
    non c'entro!- fece quello,  isterico.  -Li avessi tutti quei
    soldi che volete, ve li darei di tasca mia.  Non  so  niente
    degli   intrallazzi   batteriologici   della   Corporazione.
    Nemmeno  mi  ero  accorto  di  avere un clandestino a bordo.
    L'avete detto anche voi che con quella tuta...

     Fu interrotto da  uno  sparo.   Nella  stazione i rumori si
    senti vano.  L'ultimo nelle orecchie del  pilota  fu  quello
    del  colpo  che  era  diretto al suo cranio.  -Che facciamo,
    Gus?-  domando'  uno   dei  due,  all'esterno.   -Rientrate.
    Dobbiamo parlare.  I demoni guardiani  accesero  i  getti  e
    planarono  nervosamente  verso il portello della piu' vicina
    camera di equilibrio.  Alle loro spalle, il fondale stellato
    si deformo' attorno a  una sagoma invisibile.  Nella cambusa
    il piu' anziano degli ostaggi disse a Gus: -Il ricatto aveva
    senso finché reggeva il segreto sulla nostra  produzione  di
    Virus   Irreversibile.    Con  la  missione  di  salvataggio
    fallita, sara' la Corporazione  stessa  a informare i media.
    Diranno della tua minaccia di sganciarlo  nell'atmosfera  se
    la Corporazione non ti versava...  quanti milioni di dollari
    hai  chiesto?   -Dovevano  bastare per tutti- si giustifico'
    Gus.  -Ora comunque-  continuo'  l'anziano,  -tutto il mondo
    sapra' che qui si sintetizza il Virus Irreversibile, l'unica
    soluzione per il controllo demografico.   Soltanto  che  non
    l'avremmo  usato  a  caso,  come  minacciate  voi.   Era una
    sorpresina per  quei  posti  nel  Terzo  e  Quarto Mondo che
    scoppiano  di  pezzenti  e  ci  sventolano  addosso  testate
    nucleari se non gli diamo da mangiare gratis.  -Per noi  era
    comunque  una  porcata-  disse  Gus.   -E abbiamo pensato di
    tirarcene fuori.  Con  una  piccola gratifica.  -Non avevate
    il quadro completo delle  trappole  della  Corporazione-  lo
    rimbrotto'  l'anziano,  -altrimenti  di quello sbirro non si
    sarebbe sentito nemmeno l'odore.  Con voi e qual cuno di noi
    morti nell'irruzione, si  sarebbe  liquidato l'episodio come
    un  cedimento  nervoso.   Adesso  non  hanno  scelta,  siamo
    sacrificabili.  Preferiranno rimetterci la stazione.  Se non
    ricevono un messaggio di O.K.  da quello che avete tolto  di
    mezzo la' fuori, ci faranno saltare tutti in aria.

     -Gus,  il  vecchio ha ragione- disse uno degli altri cinque
    con le armi.  -Ormai  che  gliene frega alla Corporazione di
    salvare la baracca.  -Sta' zitto- lo rimbrotto' Gus.  -Pensi
    che un'esplosione nucleare a ridosso dell'atmosfera sia  uno
    scherzo?   Hai  presente  l'oscuramento elettromagnetico che
    provocherebbe?  Comunicazioni, banche  dati:  tutto in fumo.
    Il Governo non se ne assumerebbe la responsabilita' solo per
    salvare la pelle alla Corporazione.  -Vuoi dire per  salvare
    la  pelle  all'umanita'-  lo corresse imperterrito l'anziano
    del Consiglio di  Amministrazione.-Qualsiasi  cosa e' meglio
    di una doccia di Virus Irreversibile.  Lo faranno, il botto.
    Dimostreranno   la   sincerita'   del    loro    pentimento.
    L'esperienza  servira'  a  qualcosa.   La  prossima volta il
    personale subira' uno scanning psicologico piu' accurato.  I
    modelli di  previsione  comportamentale  si perfezioneranno.
    Sapranno con dieci anni di anticipo il  momento  preciso  in
    cui ti ficcherai un dito nel naso.

     -Quando  ci  mettono  quei  due  a  rientrare- sbotto' Gus,
    ignorando l'ultima parte della tirata.  In quell'istante sul
    petto gli  si  apri'  una  voragine  di  sangue.   E cosi' a
    ciascuno degli altri complici.  Anche da morti, tuttavia, le
    dita  gli  si  contrassero  sui   grilletti,   e   risposero
    inutilmente  al fuoco contro un avversario che li aveva gia'
    annientati.  Gli ostaggi  urlarono, rifugiandosi dietro ogni
    possibile  riparo  nella   cambusa.    L'unico   a   restare
    imperturbato al centro dell'ambiente fu quello del Consiglio
    di  Amministrazione, che si ritrovo' con l'uniforme azurrina
    maculata del sangue di Gus.   Il fragore fu cosi' assordante
    da prolungarsi nel silenzio sotto forma  di  shock  uditivo.
    Un'impressione  e  nient'altro,  perché non c'erano echi tra
    quelle pareti perfettamente insonorizzate.  Parecchi istanti
    dopo la fine del massacro,  qualcuno punto' un dito tremante
    nel  vano  della  porta.   -L'aria_   si   muove   qualcosa_
    -Decompressione!-  grido' un altro disperato, fraintendendo.
    -No!   Fermi!-  li   inchiodo'   l'uomo   del  Consiglio  di
    Amministrazione.  Il movimento era quello di  superfici  che
    si  riflettono  su  uno  specchio  contorto.   Lo  strato di
    metallo si ritrasse dall'intercapedine della tuta stealth, e
    riapparve il Colonnello.

     -Feriti?- fu il suo  saluto.   Nessuno gli rispose.  Quello
    del Consiglio di Amministrazione fu il primo a  riprendersi:
    -La  davano  per  morto,  la'  fuori.  -Hanno colpito un mio
    ologramma programmato per  simulare  in  pompa magna morte e
    decompressione.    Qualcuno   si   lascio'   sfuggire    dei
    singhiozzi.  Non solo le donne.  -Atterson, del Consiglio di
    Amministrazione-   L'anziano,  porse  la  mano.   -Magnifico
    lavoro,  signor_  -Colonnello-   si   presento'  lui,  senza
    abbassare l'arma.  -E purtroppo per voi, i guai sono  appena
    incominciati.   Scalcio'  il  cadavere  di  Gus,  che  nella
    ridotta gravita' della stazione rotolo' come un manichino di
    plastica.   -Nella  Corporazione  non  esistono_-  comincio'
    Atterson.   -_gradi.  Gia', ma io vengo dall'esercito di una
    di  quelle  nazioni   alle   quali   volevate  regalare  una
    spruzzatina di Virus Irreversibile.- Lo  sguardo  gli  cadde
    sui resti del pilota.  Si passo' una mano sul viso.  -Questa
    non  e'  un'abbronzatura,  ma il colore naturale della pelle
    che si sviluppa sotto il  sole di quelle latitudini.  E sono
    davvero un colonnello.  La produzione di Virus Irreversibile
    su questa stazione gia' da un pezzo non era piu' il  segreto
    del   secolo   per   il  nostro  spionaggio.   Prima  ancora
    d'infiltrarmi nei servizi  di  sicurezza della Corporazione.
    Avevo il compito di studiare un progetto di fattibilita' per
    qualcosa  del  genere-  accenno'  alla   scena   e   lancio'
    un'occhiata  a quelli che aveva ucciso.  -Ma loro sono stati
    piu' svelti.  All'ufficio personale della Corporazione hanno
    un debole per assumere i  bastardi.   E  io lo sono, piu' di
    tutti loro e voialtri che avete lavorato al  virus.   Perché
    sono   un   bastardo  motivato.   Gus  e  i  suoi  ci  hanno
    risparmiato  un  piano  molto  piu'  complesso  per arrivare
    quassu'.  Mi  e'  bastato  offrirmi  volontario  per  questo
    salvataggio.   Ora  le  trattative  non  sono  piu'  con  la
    Corporazione,  ma con il Governo.  Il vostro.  Per conto del
    mio naturalmente.  La stazione  va  lasciata intatta e passa
    sotto il nostro controllo.  Preferiamo tenerci noi il  Virus
    Irreversibile.   Ottimo  deterrente  nel caso non esaudirete
    alcune piccole richieste di  alimenti e nuove tecnologie.  E
    se salta questa stazione, saltera' una  citta'  a  caso  del
    vostro  Grande  Paese,  la'  sotto.  Vedete, alle mie spalle
    c'e' una potenza  nucleare,  non  l'improvvisazione di Gus e
    compagni.  In piu', ho il  quadro  completo  delle  trappole
    della  Corporazione.   Contro  di me non la spuntera' nessun
    altro sbirro.

    Atterson annui' piu' volte,  assorbendo tutto cio' che aveva
    udito.  Poi gli affioro' sulle labbra un sorriso deformato e
    disse: -Ottima partita, Colonnello.

                            "@{b}STORY PROBLEM@{ub}"

                            @{i}by Greg Farnum@{ui}


 He opened the paper and was  surprised  to  see  the  name  of  "his"
 bookstore,  the  one  he  stopped  at several times a week. It was an
 election story. Two ladies who  regularly  meet  at  the  bookstore's
 coffee  shop  have  no  trouble  picking  a favorite coffee, but with
 politicians it's different. And so many issues... Mildly  bitter  but
 with  a full, rich aroma... Surprising, too, to see a story about the
 newspaper strike. The Detroit newspaper strike is  over,  a  visiting
 Wall Street analyst had told a local audience. The strikers don't yet
 realize it but the strike is  over.  They  lost.  He  says  that  the
 "people  that matter" have made that decision. The people that matter
 are back on Wall Street.

 He turned to the book page but found there was none. He was warm  and
 comfortable  sitting cross-legged on the couch with the afghan on his
 lap and the autumn sun streaming through the  window  and  a  cup  of
 coffee  on  the  little  table  in  front of him. And then the little
 creatures in his bloodstream began to stretch their  limbs  in  their
 slow  irritable way. They were waking up and they were not amused. In
 his mind's eye he could see the scowls on their cartoon-like faces as
 they  stretched  their limbs, seeking but not finding. They stretched
 like feudal lords waking at the  tail  end  of  a  banquet,  knocking
 goblets  to the floor when they found that the goblets were empty. He
 had the feeling that a toothache had been buried deep within his body
 and forgotten, and he was only now remembering. As they stretched and
 searched the toothache became worse. They wanted nicotine. He  wanted
 a  cigarette.  There were some cigarettes in the glove compartment of
 Kathy's car... no, not right now. He thought of  the  quote  by  that
 famous  and  well  respected  businessman -- Cigarettes are the ideal
 product: make 'em for a penny, sell 'em for buck, they've  got  great
 brand  loyalty  and they're addictive. He rubbed his face and let the
 little creatures scurry painfully through his veins.

 "Surreal," said Kathy as she joined him on  the  couch,  curling  her
 legs  up  beneath her robe. "Yes?" "The way Henry said 'I'll show you
 where the good stuff is' yesterday when we went  into  Abercrombie  &
 Fitch." She reached down and grabbed a large slab of the Sunday paper
 off the floor; $300,000 houses sprawled  over  her  lap  as  he  said
 "Yeah?"  "We walk in there past all these high quality clothes and he
 says 'Not here, I'll show you where the good stuff is,' and we go  to
 the  second  floor  past  all these nice clothes and into the teenage
 department. Cheap gaudy stuff. The place mothers take  their  teenage
 daughters  to  when  they insist on buying something sleazy." "Yeah?"
 "Yeah, the kind of stuff a middle-aged guy would  buy  his  seventeen
 year old girlfriend." Henry had a seventeen year old girlfriend.

 That  day  had  begun with a phone call. Henry had wanted to meet for
 coffee. They'd decided on the Barnes  &  Noble  just  down  Rochester
 Road.  Like  most  of  the superstores this book store had a cafe. An
 ample cafe. You could skate in it.

 "Different values," Henry said. Three  cups  of  coffee  and  several
 books  were  between them. "I don't know if it's genetic or what." He
 was talking about his two sons and his former wife, Mary.  Henry  and
 Tom  recapped  in an allusive way the stories about Mary's family and
 its relationships with things and money that they  had  told  before,
 stopping  occasionally  to provide a fuller, less cryptic version for
 Kathy. "When Mary and her brothers were young  and  they  needed  new
 shoes,"  said  Tom, "their dad used to march them into Sears and have
 them all try on shoes, then say 'Come on kids, let's go,'  and  march
 them  all  out  again  with  the  new  shoes  on."  "Really?" "Yeah,"
 corroborated Henry, "they'd steal the shoes. That's the kind  of  guy
 their dad was."

 Henry and Tom savored that story, Henry because it seemed to make his
 point, Tom because it was so dramatic,  so  surprising.  It  was  the
 center around which the other stories about money and honor seemed to
 revolve like atomic particles around the nucleus of an atom. And once
 these  particles  were set in motion other particles were called into
 being. Some of these new particles were  individual  stories,  others
 were  formed from several stories linked together, all related to the
 nuclear story by an emotional gravity.

 There was the $300 he'd loaned         There was the car
 to Dan to help Dan out of that         that Paul had
 jam he'd gotten into in the Army       borrowed from Dee,
 down in North Carolina. The loan       Henry's love child
 that was never paid back, never        daughter, and her
 mentioned.                             husband, the one
                                        they had loaned to
                                        help Paul out, and
                                        all the tickets Paul
                                        had gotten and never
                                        mentioned and never
                                        paid.

 There were the hundreds of dollars in phone calls that  Dan  and  his
 fiancee had charged up and never mentioned and never paid. Then there
 was the $750 in taxes and title charge on Paul's  car.  How  much  of
 that $750 have you saved? None. Henry paid the $750.

 "Values,"  said  Henry.  "Take and never give. Did they learn this or
 were they born with it?" "All you care about is money. You're a money
 grubbing  old  bastard."  That's  the part that came next. Those were
 Mary's words, repeated many times before she left  for  Florida  with
 her lesbian lover to open a hot dog stand.

 "I  don't  think  that's  true," said Henry, "it's just a question of
 reciprocity. You know, all take and no give.  Like  when  Paul  first
 came  to  me  for the $750 for his car. He got Dee to co-sign for the
 entire $8,000 so he didn't have to pay a thing except  $750  tax  and
 title,  and  I  said to him how much have you saved and he said none.
 Not a damn thing. So I said to him call your mother down  in  Florida
 and  get  half of it from her and I'll give you the other half. So he
 comes to me later and says his mother can't do  it  because  all  her
 money  is  tied  up  in  the  restaurant  and she doesn't have a cent
 because she's still making payments on the car. I said what? She told
 you  that?  She  got  $20,000 out of the sale of the house and then I
 took $4,000 out of my share and paid off her car. She's not paying on
 that god damned car."

 "She  said  that?"  asked Kathy. Her response was like a bell calling
 the table to attention. The inadvertent force  of  Henry's  last  few
 words  was  greater  than even Henry cared for. "Well, sometimes Paul
 gets things mixed up," he  said.  "For  all  I  know  he  might  have
 misheard.  It's possible. But..." Half an hour later they were at the
 mall. Henry said he needed to pick up  a  new  hat  and  some  winter
 gloves.  "This  was in all the papers when I first moved up here from
 Cincinnati, before you and the kids joined me," said Tom  as  he  and
 Kathy  walked  toward  the  large  granite  ball in the center of the
 place, Henry slightly ahead of them. "All about how fancy this  place
 was  going to be when it opened. The papers quoted some woman who was
 here on opening day: 'This is  the  greatest  experience  in  Detroit
 shopping history.'" "Jesus."

 They  passed  the ball: 4,250 pounds of granite, said the plaque, and
 it revolved on a stream of water. It struck Tom as dangerous. It came
 from  Finland.  They  went  to  various  stores.  Henry  had recently
 purchased things from many of them. Nowadays  Henry  liked  to  shop.
 Since  Mary  left  he  had money to burn. The last store they visited
 seemed to sell nothing but leather bound notebooks. Henry said he had
 purchased  one for his young girlfriend. Tom picked one up, looked at
 the price tag inside the back cover: $45. They ended with coffee.

 "I bought three pairs of  pants  there,"  said  Henry,  stirring  his
 coffee.  "They  cost  $50  a pair compared to Dockers which only cost
 $38, but these are made from better material  and  they  last  longer
 than Dockers. You get what you pay for."

 Tom  had been starring at a little scrap of paper since he'd returned
 from the bathroom a couple of minutes before.  He  pushed  the  paper
 toward  the  center  of the table so Kathy and Henry could see. On it
 was written: 3.8 Lpf/1.0 gpf Tom smiled. "I finally  know  what  that
 means."  Across  the courtyard the ball revolved slowly. "I find that
 threatening," said Kathy. "You  do?"  asked  Tom,  straightening  his
 bathrobe  and  glancing  down  at  Dole registers gains among Oakland
 County voters. "Yeah, as a middle-aged woman I do. He talks about how
 Mary  and  the  kids  were always after his money then he gets rid of
 Mary and goes out and buys himself all  new  everything  and  gets  a
 seventeen year old girlfriend. So, like that's what guys are supposed
 to do when they get to be  his  age?"  Tom's  age.  Forty-seven.  Tom
 didn't  even  want  to  touch  that  subject or the odd pact that now
 constituted his friendship with Henry; instead his mind flashed  back
 to  the numbers, each of them having a tangible mass and weight which
 held all the stories and emotions that  had  attached  themselves  to
 that  number. Singly, they were graspable; in the aggregate they were
 like one of those complex story problems that you'd get at the end of
 math class in junior high. "Extra credit!" the teacher would say...

                          @{i}by Alessio Robotti@{ui}

 
     Distrattamente,  tra  la gente annoiata  che  ogni  ultima
    domenica  del  mese affollava la fiera,  i  loro  occhi  si
    incrociarono,  piu' e piu' volte, osservando le  bancarelle
    stracolme  di  oggetti  curiosi. Infine,  si  guardarono  a
    lungo: gli occhi neri e profondi di Andrea sembravano voler
    disegnare preziosi arabeschi nell'azzurro di quelli di lei.
     Nella  piazzetta  sul lago c'erano molti turisti,  qualche
    curioso  e i ragazzi del luogo che correvano da una giostra
    all'altra. Alcune anziane coppie si muovevano lente  tra  i
    banchi, quasi ballando vecchi valzer viennesi.

     Lei  -  bionda, giovane ed un poco incerta -  si  aggirava
    come  cercando  con ansia qualche oggetto smarrito  tra  le
    bancarelle.  Sembrava fosse qualcosa  di  molto  preciso  e
    nello  stesso  tempo  indefinito,  sconosciuto:  forse   un
    vecchio oggetto perduto ormai nella memoria.
     Andrea  le  si  accosto', dapprima  con  discrezione,  poi
    quasi  con eccessiva invadenza; per farsi notare, acquisto'
    - a un prezzo esorbitante - una vecchia stampa inglese: due
    cerve si abbeveravano sulla riva di un lago.
     Nell'osservarla piu' attentamente, si feri'  al  dito  con
    una  scheggia  che  sporgeva  dalla  cornice.  Estrasse  un
    fazzoletto per tamponare il sangue e lei finalmente sembro'
    accorgersi della sua presenza: lo sguardo era caldo,  quasi
    affettuoso, mentre aiutava Andrea a fasciare al  meglio  la
    ferita.

     Tornarono   assieme   verso   l'albergo.   Chiacchierando,
    gettavano  verso  il  cielo  quei  sorrisi  che  solo   gli
    innamorati sanno imprimere al volto.
     Salutandola, Andrea noto' come il suo seno fosse  dolce  e
    ben  disegnato, le gambe fresche e leggere, il corpo docile
    e caldo.
     Lei aveva una stanza al terzo piano; Andrea pure.
     "Grazie, e' stato un pomeriggio molto piacevole."
     "Forse,  domani, ci sara' ancora qualcosa da  scovare  tra
    quelle vecchie cianfrusaglie: lo faresti ancora con me?"
     "Certo,  domani..."  Piccola pausa di solitudine:  con  il
    cuore  in gola e la mente ormai colma di affetto, le parole
    escono a stento dalle labbra arrossate.
     "A  domani..." e le bocche si scoprono a tradire  speranze
    che  esplodono in petto, mentre -lentamente - due porte  si
    chiudono.
     Non  passa  mezz'ora: lei chiama per prima.  "Sono  ancora
    io:  che  fai?  Gia' dormivi?" Andrea - la  mano  gia'  sul
    telefono  -  quasi  balbetta. "No, no di  certo...  potremo
    vederci se vuoi..." Il graffio sul dito sanguina ancora: lo
    porta alla bocca, lo succhia con forza, lo morde.
     La  sera sul lago c'e' una nebbia sottile: confidenze  che
    scivolano piane, leggere, carezze.
     "Sono  qui di passaggio, un incontro di lavoro  e  poi  un
    giorno buco...E tu?"
     "Una  voglia,  un sogno: il lago e' bellissimo  in  questa
    stagione."
     "E'   vero.  Certo  non  e'  immenso  e  misterioso   come
    l'oceano;  e'  pero' dolce, come un letto  in  cui  sarebbe
    bello dormire..."
     "Infelice? Davvero si nota? In effetti..."

     Mentre  parlavano,  Andrea  percepiva il  calore  del  suo
    corpo,  immaginava il sapore della sua lingua, la  dolcezza
    delle  sue gambe: avvicino' lentamente la bocca al viso  di
    lei,  mentre  con un dito le faceva dolcemente  fremere  le
    labbra. Passo', con lentezza, le mani tra i biondi capelli:
    poi, la strinse a se' con passione, quasi con forza.
     Nel  buio,  trovarono  a stento la  via  del  ritorno.  In
    camera, mentre Andrea le accarezzava ancora i capelli,  lei
    sorrise  con  tenero  candore, e, spogliandosi  lentamente,
    spalanco'  davanti  ai  suoi occhi una  distesa  di  sabbia
    dorata.
     Prima  che  fosse completamente nuda, Andrea  la  afferro'
    per  la  vita e la strinse a se', con dolcezza: il contatto
    con  la  sua morbida pelle risulto' quasi violento,  troppo
    distante  da  ogni  sua precedente esperienza.  Chiuse  gli
    occhi:  la  sua mente ebbe strani sussulti,  gli  parve  di
    lievitare  in  uno spazio ovattato e felice. Poi  un  lieve
    dolore costrinse i suoi occhi a riaprirsi.
     I  corpi immobili erano adesso distesi sul letto; lei  era
    del  tutto nuda e, come stupita, guardava Andrea attraverso
    gli  occhiali  che, come unico orpello,  aveva  lasciato  a
    impreziosirle il sorriso.
     "Sara'  dolce far l'amore con te": disse tutto d'un fiato,
    quasi  vergognandosi o temendo forse d'incespicare in cosi'
    ardue sillabe.


     Furono queste le sole parole che, quella notte, Andrea  le
    senti'  pronunciare:  ma  il suo corpo  parlava  con  frasi
    stupende.  Come  una dolce nenia, poteva ascoltare  i  suoi
    seni  leggermente oscillare; le loro dure punte disegnargli
    sentieri  sul ventre; le umide ascelle profumare  di  aspri
    colori;  la  sua  lingua succhiare ogni piccola  goccia  di
    desiderio, per poi condividerlo assieme, in teneri  giochi,
    tra le labbra assetate.
     Dei   loro  corpi  nulla  rimase  inesplorato.   Le   mani
    cercarono  ovunque  triangoli  di  carne  da  scaldare,  da
    stringere,  accarezzare. Le labbra succhiarono  a  lungo  i
    dolci  umori  che,  a rivoli, traboccarono  poi  sui  visi,
    addolcendone  le  forme. Le lingue trovarono  sempre  nuove
    geometrie da violare e, insinuandosi impertinenti in  esse,
    tornavano  spesso ad unirsi - quasi a cercarne  conforto  e
    conferma - in appassionati abbracci, spandendo, nelle avide
    bocche,  i  frutti  caldi  ed  oscuri  delle  loro   audaci
    frequentazioni.
     Quel  lento, poi frenetico ed infine estenuante  esercizio
    dei sensi fu pero' un nonnulla - lieve pioggia d'autunno  -
    a  confronto del turbinio che avvolse, in quella stanza,  i
    loro cuori, le loro menti.
     Quando  la  notte  si inchino' alle prime luci  dell'alba,
    trovo'   due  corpi  esausti  e  felici:  a  stento   pote'
    ricondurli  alle  anime  attonite e stupefatte  che,  quasi
    casualmente,  si  trovarono anche loro,  quella  notte,   a
    giacere nella medesima stanza d'albergo.

     Andrea  si  sveglio' d'improvviso: il dito  era  gonfio  e
    dolorante.  Si guardo' attorno e s'accorse che le  lenzuola
    erano  coperte  da  piccole gocce  di  sangue:  disegnavano
    ancora i mille sentieri percorsi in quella notte d'amore.
     Lei  ancora  dormiva,  il giovane ed  esile  corpo  appena
    coperto  da  un lembo di stoffa: d'improvviso  percepi'  la
    cruda  differenza  con il suo, maturo  e  pesante.  Avrebbe
    potuto essere sua figlia!
     Raccolse  in  silenzio i vestiti: li indosso'  lentamente,
    cercando   di   nascondere  alla  mente  i   ricordi   che,
    prepotenti,  gli  si  affollavano nella  testa.  Un  ultimo
    sguardo, un'istantanea, poi usci' trattenendo il respiro.
     L'aria  fresca del mattino, costrinse Andrea a  riprendere
    contatto  con  la realta'. Era stata una notte  bellissima:
    troppo  dolce, tenera, appassionata per poter sostenere  il
    confronto  con  le  mille che gia' aveva vissuto.  Non  era
    facile trovare una via di uscita.
     Decise  di  prendere l'auto e fare il giro del  lago:  tra
    breve   il  sole  sarebbe  apparso  da  dietro  le  colline
    diradando la leggera foschia che avvolgeva ogni cosa.
     A  Milano  c'era chi stava aspettando il suo  ritorno:  ma
    sarebbe  stato possibile riprendere la vita di ogni giorno,
    dimenticare  quella notte? Scappare di corsa, di  nascosto,
    come   un   ladro,   senza  chiederle  neppure   il   nome,
    l'indirizzo? Senza un bacio, un arrivederci, un saluto. Era
    assurdo, eppure non poteva fare altrimentri: non riusciva a
    pensare ad altra soluzione.
     D'improvviso il sole spunto' tra la nebbia; per  un  breve
    istante  i suoi occhi ne furono ricolmi. Strinse con  forza
    il  volante  e  subito una fitta al dito distrasse  il  suo
    sguardo:    la    piccola   ferita    sanguinava    ancora.
    Istintivamente   porto'  la  mano  alle   labbra   e   poi,
    d'improvviso, un grande freddo l'avvolse.
     L'acqua  torno'  subito immobile. Nulla  avrebbe  lasciato
    supporre quello che era accaduto. Solo una vecchia  cornice
    galleggiava; a stento si intravedevano ancora due cerve sul
    bordo di un lago.

     Il  medico  di  turno scopri' quel corpo ormai  inanimato;
    l'infermiera  intanto leggeva, con voce distratta,  i  dati
    anagrafici.
     "Andrea  Rossini; anni 40; luogo di nascita Buenos  Aires;
    nubile."
     Spostando,   quasi  con  delicatezza,  i  lunghi   capelli
    corvini  dal  petto, il medico aggiunse:  "Era  ancora  una
    bella donna, davvero... Ah l'Argentina, l'Argentina: quante
    volte l'ho sognata da ragazzo..."
     Con  un  sospiro di nostalgia per il non vissuto,  guardo'
    verso  la  finestra;  poi scosse  il  capo  e  affondo'  il
    bisturi.

                         @{i}by Ellen. G. Horovitz@{ui}


          So,  we were cleaning up the kitchen, the kids and  I.
    Bryan,  my  bright-eyed, copper headed, five  year  old  was
    doing  that sweep thing with the broom: you know, where  the
    kid pretends to clean but really just spreads the mites into
    other corners. And Kaitlyn, my blue-eyed, blonde Barbie look-
    alike,  helpful  prim  eight year  old  that  she  was,  was
    actually  clearing  the table. Can you  imagine?  The  "help
    gene" had finally kicked in.
        And  I was piling the unwashed dishes into the sink.  My
    Labrador,  Bailey, dutifully took her place  underneath  the
    dishwasher, praying for handouts or at the very least, a few
    droppings  on  the floor.  My doe-eyed, Bambi-esque,  divine
    canine  was,  by default, my garbage disposal. Sure,  I  was
    aware that it's the yuppie thing to nourish that sub-species
    `Lamb  avec  Rice' or some ungodly concoction that  we  have
    designed  to make us feel good about those ground  up  horse

    hooves that we feed them.
          But,  I  have to admit, I like the disposal thing.  As
    much  as  I love to think that I have really contributed  to
    the environment (via the compost bin that I religiously fill
    yet never manage to empty), Bailey really is wonderful in  a
    pinch:  she  eats  that slop, generic macaroni  and  cheese,
    better than any person I know. Hell, she'll even down one of
    those "short cut" carrots. You know, the kind they make  for
    those harried, overworked, two job, single mother-types like
    me. If it weren't for the "prepared food" isle, I'd be dead.
    And my kids would have nothing for lunch.
          Sure, I have fantasies of June Cleaver on "Leave it to
    Beaver"  and I look to my caretaker, Laurie, as a  demi-god.
    She  actually enjoys the mothering thing. She bakes. My idea
    of  cooking is gourmet. But in reality, I fall short of Spam
    on  toast and Chicken and Stars soup by Campbell. Some women
    like  to cook; some women like to write. It's the day job  I
    can't shed.
         Anyway, speaking of food, and we were, it's about those
    carrots, remember the carrots? Well, I recycled two of those
    short  cuts  to Bailey. Remember Bailey? You know  the  slam
    hound from recycle Heaven? Well, she's a dawg. She ate them.
    I  turned  back  to  my sink, now filled  with  dishes,  and
    proceeded  to  funnel  them into the  dishwasher  where  she
    champed on those carrots.
         Suddenly, I noticed that Bailey was shaking, all over.
          Now,  what you have to understand here is that earlier
    that  day, Bryan had learned the E.D.I.T.H. anachronism   in
    Kindergarten  - you know, Emergency Drill In The  Home.  (It
    was  Fire  Prevention Week and so he had gone to  the  local
    fire  station and had learned how to drop and roll and above
    all,  dial  "991" (as he insisted)). Seeing Bailey  in  this
    state,  he  thought she was merely doing the EDITH  (or  the
    Macarena). It definitely was not the Electric Slide. In  any
    event, I knew better. Or at least I thought I did. At  first
    glance,  I  remembered the carrots and I thought,  "My  God,
    she's  choking on a carrot!" In fact, I felt her  throat  to
    feel  if it were lodged there. When that failed to alleviate
    the symptom, I actually tried the Heimlich maneuver. I mean,
    can  you  imagine how ridiculous it looks to give  a  dog  a
    Heimlich  maneuver? And I attempted it not once, but  twice.
    But I couldn't get Bailey to elevate. She couldn't get up on
    her  legs. Finally, when my stupidity cleared, I remembered.
    This  wasn't  a  choking dog, this was  a  genuine,  seizure
    disorder.
          I had forgotten that when Bailey was a pup, she wended
    her  way  into a metal pole trying to catch a fly ball.  She
    was  unconscious and shaking just like this  for  about  two
    minutes.  I  thought she was dead, or about to be.  But  she
    recovered; for awhile she would do just what she  was  doing
    now,  shake uncontrollably and act all paralyzed for  a  few
    minutes.
          I  even  asked our veterinarian what we could do.  The
    options  were  many,  but one of the top considerations  was
    Phenobarbital.  Naturally, I opted to ignore that  protocol,
    which is how we got to this place in the story.
         Meanwhile, Bryan was hysterical and screaming at Bailey
    to  drop  and roll. Kaitlyn was screeching, "She's going  to
    die,  she's  going to die." And I, with little  presence  of
    mind,  decided  to get her bowl of water, stupidly  thinking
    that might work. Bryan, convinced that I had lost my marbles
    by now, screamed repeatedly, "Call 991, call 991!"
           Suddenly,   I   retraced  my  ancestral,   cob-webbed
    blueprints  of  my mind and recalled   that she  needed  the
    equivalent of an antigen. Hell, it's not like I had smelling
    salt  or  something.  But, she was a  canine.  They  run  on
    instinct,  pure and unadulterated. As I scanned the  kitchen
    for something that would work, suddenly I spied a half-eaten
    bowl of Kaitlyn's dinner, chicken and rice. I grabbed it and
    put it down at nose level. Miracle of miracle and Eureka!  I
    had  found  the  cure: she bolted upright on all  fours  and
    gobbled  the  food. Amazing how the olfactory  system  kicks
    everything into gear. After all, this was a dog;  you  know,
    they  are  truly led around by the nose. It doesn't  take  a
    rocket   scientist  to  figure  that  one  out.  So   forget

    Davanti a me c'e' una  strada  larga e lunghissima.  Ai lati
    si alzano alti palazzi di vetro lucido.Intorno ai miei passi
    un traffico ininterrotto  di  macchine  scure  che  sembrano
    vuote.Dalle  vetrine  dei  negozi  mi giungono lampi di luci
    colorate e violente  musiche  ritmate.Ed io cammino seguendo
    la strada senza sapere dove va a finire.Chissa',forse  porta
    in un posto insignificante o,forse,non finisce affatto.Ma io
    continuo  a  camminare  come  se fossi condannato a non fare
    altro per il resto dei  miei  giorni.E  dopo un po' gli alti
    palazzi di vetro lucido e le  macchine  scure  che  sembrano
    vuote  e  le  luci  e  le  musiche  violente  delle  vetrine
    cominciano  a  confondersi  nella  mia testa ed a formare un
    insieme omogeneo tanto che dopo qualche chilometro mi sembra
    di aver sempre vissuto in  mezzo  a tutto questo.  Non so da
    quanto tempo sto camminando e non mi ricordo da dove vengo e
    probabilmente i miei piedi sono a pezzi ma non me  ne  rendo
    conto.Ogni  tanto  avverto  una  strana  sensazione,come  se
    volessi  fermarmi,ma le gambe non rispondono piu' ai comandi
    di  un  cervello  ormai  senza  forza.Anzi  sembrano proprio
    loro,le gambe,a comandare il gioco  come  se  dopo  anni  di
    sudditanza   dal   "governo  centrale"  avessero  finalmente
    conquistato l'autonomia.E il cervello,dal canto suo,vista la
    situazione,si tira da parte e lascia fare.

    Il sole  e'  tramontato  da  un  pezzo  o  forse  non e' mai
    sorto.La  luna  non  c'e'  e  neanche  le  stelle.L'aria  e'
    gelida.........qualcosa di colpo mi trattiene......come  una
    morsa  attorno  ad  braccio.......ed  un suono indistinto mi
    ronza nelle  orecchie.La  forza  che  mi  stringe il braccio
    comincia  a  scuotermi  ed  il  suono  comincia  a  prendere
    forma.........ecco,e'        qualcuno         che         mi
    chiama...."Paolo....Paolo...e'   tardi....t'ho   portato  il
    caffe'....si    raffredda....."    Comincio    a    rendermi
    conto....Paolo...Paolo Berardi....devo alzarmi per andare al
    lavoro....il Ministero.....m'ha  raccomandato il vescovo...e
    anche    l'assessore...il    concorso.....Ministero    delle
    Poste....impiegato di quarto  livello  con  possibilita'  di
    carriera,busta paga ogni mese, tredicesima, quattordicesima,
    ferie pagate.......  Rosetta mi porta il caffe' da quando ho
    l'eta'  per  berlo e prima,per molti anni,mi ha preparato il
    latte.Ormai   non   si   regge   in   piedi   e   l'asma  la
    tormenta.Povera Rosetta,senza saperlo mi ha svegliato da  un
    incubo e trascinato in un altro.

                               **************

    Il Ministero e' un  posto  asettico fatto di lunghi corridoi
    affollati di  gente  che  cammina  in  fretta  con  in  mano
    tabulati    e    cartelle    portadocumenti.Sembrano   tutti
    uguali,vestiti di grigio  scuro,cravatta  e occhiali a mezza
    luna calati sul naso.Ma la cosa che piu' mi colpisce e'  che
    sono  tutti  calvi.Forse  presto perdero' i capelli anch'io.
    Il   capufficio   mi   passa   accanto   velocemente   e  mi
    dice"Berardi,mi raccomando la pratica Menotti".Rido fra me e
    me e penso"Si,mo mando una raccomandata a  Ciro  Menotti".Ma
    la  voglia  di ridere mi passa subito perche' mi ricordo che
    si tratta di un lavoraccio  che  mi portera' via un sacco di
    tempo.  Nella mia stanza gli altri  due  colleghi(credo  che
    siano  gli  stessi  di sempre ma potrebbero essere altri due
    visto che mi sembrano tutti uguali)sono gia' la loro posto e
    quando  entrando  li  saluto  mi  rispondono  senza  neanche
    guardarmi.   Mi  tuffo  nella   pratica   che  mi  e'  stata
    assegnata.E' un plico enorme che  avevo  ga'  notato  giorni
    prima;non  c'e'  un grammo di polvere e la cosa mi sorprende
    perche'  l'incatramento  sembra  molto  vecchio.C'e' scritto
    "Menotti-domanda di assunzione".

    Apro il plico e comincio a leggere il  contenuto;domanda  al
    Ministero(  il  sottoscritto...), lettera di raccomandazione
    del parroco,lettera  del  segretario  comunale,relazione dei
    carabinieri,certificati medici e quant'altro serve in questi
    casi.Poi  arriva  una  serie  di  note  del  Ministero(dalla
    sezione  A,della  F,dall'ufficio  affari   interni,dal   mio
    capufficio..     ....).Ecco    ho    quasi   finito;l'ultimo
    foglio......resto a  bocca  aperta.....e'  un  certficato di
    morte  del  Menotti.Risale  a  sei  anni  fa.Non   so   cosa
    fare.Decido  di chiamare il capufficio.  Al telefono la voce
    inconfondibile di chi da' ordini e non ammette discussioni.

    "Signor   capufficio,   sono   Berardi,secondo  piano,quinto
    corridoio a  sinistra.Per  quella  pratica...Menotti...credo
    che  possa  essere  archiviata.Il richiedente e' deceduto da
    sei anni".  "Berardi,al Ministero  non  ci sono pratiche che
    si possono archiviare.Dobbiamo rispondere.Scriva che per  il
    momento  non  ci  e' possibile prendere in considerazione la
    domanda in quanto  non  ci  sono  posti  vacanti  e non sono
    previste  nnuove  assunzioni.Mi  faccia  avere  la   pratica
    completata  nel  mio  ufficio  entro  le  17,30".  Rimango a
    fissare    il     telefono.I     colleghi     mi    guardano
    sghignazzando.......  Mi metto al lavoro interrompendo  solo
    per un caffe' verso l'ora di pranzo.La cosa e' lunga perche'
    devo far riferimento ad ogni singolo documento contenuto nel
    fascicolo.   Alle  17,15 il lavoro e' completo e mando tutto
    l'incartamento  al  capufficio  da  un  usciere.   Poco dopo
    timbro il cartellino e sono per strada.Mi avvio verso casa e
    decido di andare a piedi per prendere un po' d'aria.Mi viene
    da pensare al povero Menotti  che  non  avra'  il  posto  di
    portalettere..........e  comincio  a chiedermi che ci faccio
    io in un posto  come  il  Ministero  in mezzo a tutte quelle
    cartacce  a  scrivere  lettere  a   gente   morta   da   sei
    anni.......Mi   sembra  di  impazzire......forse  sono  solo
    stanco ma mi sento confuso.

    Il cielo e' grigio ma non  piove  e la citta' mi sembra piu'
    triste del solito.Non ho voglia di  tornare  a  casa.Non  so
    dove  andare.Mi guardo intorno.........davanti a me c'e' una
    strada larga e lunghissima.Ai lati si alzano alti palazzi di
    vetro lucido.Intorno ai miei passi.....

 My lover was out of town so I  squired  Charlotte.  It  was  a  party
 surrounding  a  new  movie  about  a  friend  of ours. The film was a
 National Film Board documentary about Henry Wishart Osborne, a fairly
 well  known  novelist  who  had  recently  died  of  AIDS. And that's
 important because it  determined  that  a  large  proportion  of  the
 audience  was gay. It included a substantial number of dykes who were
 friends of Henry as he had spent a goodly portion of the past  twenty
 years  in  striving  to  keep the two homosexual constituents working
 together. He was a bit of a crusader where gay unity  was  concerned.
 Some  regarded  him  as a gay saint. Charlotte seemed to know next to
 nothing about Henry Osborne except she may well have assumed  he  was
 gay in that I`d told her he'd had dinner with us from time to time. I
 guess I should explain a little about Charlotte herself.  She  was  a
 tall,  fashionably  dressed  widow  in  her sixties with aggressively
 blonde hair in a huge beehive hair-style, and a dowdy daughter in her
 late  thirties  who  recently  redeemed  herself  in maternal eyes by
 making her a grandmother. Arethusa, with her cartload of jewelry  and
 tight  silvery  laugh,  was  a frequent visitor to our Vancouver home
 where she had met a fair number of our gay friends.

 That might have been enough to earn her  the  title  of  fag-hag  but
 somehow no-one said it to her heavily powdered face. Although utterly
 at ease  with  a  bunch  of  unmarried  men  who  chatted  about  the
 exorbitant  cost  of  new drapes, Charlotte, with true Canadian mien,
 never heard or saw anything she didn't want to. Brass monkeys were no
 competition for her Canuck discretion. Not for a moment did I think I
 was taking a risk in inviting her to the invitation-only premie're of
 THE  HEALING  PEN  but  I  must admit to twenty-twenty hindsight. The
 chatter was shrill in the crowded foyer. There was  also  the  steady
 chink  of  drinks  around the no-host bar. On that warm March day the
 low afternoon sun  spilled  in  from  open  doors,  washed  boxes  of
 flowering  daffodils. The primarily young crowd were in short sleeved
 shirts and blouses, sweaters suspended from waists  and  giant  sport
 shoes  worthy  of  Mickey Mouse. Uppermost in my mind was the need to
 put names to faces so that I could present  Charlotte  to  those  who
 would approach and politely expect to be introduced. That distraction
 made me less attentive to the stately companion who sailed at my side
 than I should have been.

 The  evidence  of  that  was  unsettlingly  immediate. I was about to
 introduce Charlotte to an  importunate  decorator  queen  who  rashly
 assumed  that  anyone  at  my  arm was important and thus potentially
 useful. "This is Orville," I began, only to find that  Charlotte  was
 not  eyeing  the  slight  figure in a tangerine shirt and tight black
 pants but two women at our rear. I turned too, to see a stocky  woman
 in  her fifties hungrily licking the earhole of her equally bulky, if
 slightly younger companion. Both women seemed quite oblivious of  our
 presence until the ear-explorer smiled at my companion and generously
 invited, in the expansiveness of Sapphic sharing, my startled  friend
 to  have  a  nibble  of  her  lover's nacreous lobe if she so wished.
 Charlotte didn't glide up to me in her usual fashion but pranced like
 a  startled  elk  in my direction. Orville grinned broadly, revealing
 his second treasure, a set of niveous white teeth.  (His  number  one
 treasure,  prominently  displayed  via  the tight pants, was half way
 between those teeth and his dainty little feet. He, like  me,  wasn't
 wearing Adidas or Roebucks.)

 "I`m  Orville Daubney. Have you noticed how Vancouver gets more ose',
 day by day? And to think we're here to see a  movie  about  that  old
 closet  queen,  Henry." He put a manicured hand up to his mouth. "Oh,
 what am I saying?" Whether goaded by his flamboyance I`m unsure,  but
 she  certainly  seemed  to  speedily  shed  her  reaction  to the now
 french-tongueing women. "Did you say, Daubney?" she asked, her  voice
 several notches higher than usual. "Any relation to Kenneth Daubney?"
 Orville curtsied. "My father," he admitted happily." My first  lover,
 as a matter of fact." "I went to high school with him,"Charlotte told
 him hurriedly.  "Prince  of  Wales?"  "The  one  and  only,"  Orville
 affirmed." I went there, too. Like it`s all in the family - as I said
 earlier about darlin` Dad." I  steered  her  firmly  away  from  him.
 Sapphic  dalliance  in  public  was one thing - incest quite another.
 æOut of the frying pan into the fire'  is  just  a  rather  shop-worn
 saying  for  some  people. For me it sometimes seems a way of life. I
 veered away from Orville to confront Norman Winfield.  Norman  was  a
 piss-poor  poet  and  frustrated politician who vehemently believed I
 was just a reactionary blot on the gay radical landscape. He  swiftly
 surveyed  the  glittering  bulk  of Charlotte before firing his first
 torpedo.

 "I`m glad you brought a friend in drag, Davey. Where on earth did you
 find  such  magnificence?  My those sequins! And what a hair-do. Am I
 imagining things or do I see a white mouse  peeking  out  from  those
 peroxide strands?" Desperately I tried a defense. "I don`t know about
 mice, sweetie, but I`m sure looking at a rat. And if you  don`t  mind
 my  mixing  metaphors,  have  you  written any more doggerel lately?"
 Torpedo number two. " I beg both your pardons.  Now  I  can  see  the
 resemblance.  "It's your mother, n`est-ce pas, Davey?" My hand wasn't
 gently at her elbow but grabbing the fat of  her  arm  as  I  elected
 retreat. I shoved her into the theater where mercifully the screening
 was about to begin. But trouble was not yet done. As the film reached
 a  moment  of  quiet  solemnity,  an  actor reading from Henry's last
 novel, those two amorous ladies from the foyer who were sitting right
 in front of us, emboldened by the gloom, progressed much further with
 their mutual groping with one head  even  sinking  down  out  of  our
 sight.  Charlotte  suddenly  pinched my thigh hard before creaking to
 her feet and announcing in a hoarse voice  I`d  never  heard  before.
 "Let's get the fuck out of here!" We did. FINIS

    Settembre  1996.  La filiale pricipale della Blu Bus Records
    si trova davanti  a  noi  in  un  antico  palazzo del centro
    storico di Milano fino a qualche  anno  prima  sede  di  una
    prestigiosa assicurazione straniera.  Guardo l'ora: le 15.00
    in punto.

    "Entriamo" dico a Luca.
    "Ma sei sicuro che ci aspettano?"
    "Certo,  abbiamo appuntamento.  Ti ho gia' detto che uno dei
    boss e' un mio caro  amico, vedrai che accoglienza" dico con
    un leggero  tremolio  delle  labbra.   Varchiamo  la  soglia
    dell'ingresso  principale  e  ci troviamo in un grande atrio
    con alcune scrivanie disposte  a  semicerchio davanti a noi.
    Mi dirigo verso l'unica occupata  da  una  graziosa  ragazza
    biondo-ossigenato-vacca  con minigonna inguinale e maglietta
    attillata stile "guarda  che  belle  perette  c'ho sotto, ti
    piacerebbe dargli una registrata eh?".  La  ragazza  si  sta
    accuratamente  ritoccando  le  unghie con un discreto smalto
    nero lucido.

    "Buongiorno  signorina"  le  dico  gentilmente  "avremmo  un
    appuntamento con Sergio" "Sergio chi?" mi risponde lei senza
    distogliere  lo  sguardo  dalla  sua  principale  attivita'.
    "Sergio...  il responsabile  delle  audizioni" "Ah, il dott.
    Milani" aggiunge lei.  "Beh si'...  quello" "Terzo piano  in
    fondo  al  corridoio,  ultima  porta  a  sinistra.   C'e' la
    targhetta sulla porta, in ogni  caso.  Mi dite i vostri nomi
    cosi' mentre salite vi annuncio" "Si, io sono Angelo  Politi
    e  lui  e' Luca dei Perla Madre.  Sentirete molto parlare di
    loro da qui  a  qualche  mese"  le sorrido dirigendomi verso
    l'ascensore.  "Si,  si...   come  no"  ci  congeda  lei  con
    raggelante freddezza.

    Bussiamo alla porta con relativa targhetta.
    "Chi cazzo e'?"
    "Io me ne vado"
    "Ma no sta scherzando e' fatto cosi'"
    "Sono  Angelo"  dico  aprendo  la  porta "non ti ricordi del
    nostro appuntamento?" Sergio e'  in piedi vicino ad un'ampia
    vetrata  con  vista  sul  corso.    In   sottofondo   alcuni
    altoparlanti  diffondono "Troppo Lontano" tratto dall'ultima
    produzione Blu Bus con i  Greatest Hits dei Kina in versione
    a-cappella.

    "Ciao, entrate" ci fa  cenno  "stavo  guardando  tutti  quei
    piccioni  che volano di continuo da questo palazzo alle case
    di fronte al cornicione della chiesa nell'angolo.  Ma sapete
    quanta merda fanno quegli  uccelli?  E' impressionante!  Uno
    di questi giorni mi copro una  carabina  e...   su  sedetevi
    cosa  posso  fare per voi?" Da un mobiletto frigo-bar estrae
    tre chinotti.  Sergio  e'  un  rocker non piu' giovanissimo,
    alto,  fisico  da  palestra  100%  straight-edge  e  un  bel
    tatuaggio stile "Parental Advisory" della Sub Pop, ma con la
    scritta "Fuck you all" sul robusto braccio sinistro.

    "Ehm, hai poi ascoltato il demo dei Perla Madre che ti avevo
    spedito?" dico sorseggiando un po' di chinotto "Lui e'  Luca
    il leader del gruppo".  "Salve" si presenta timidamente Luca
    tendendo  la mano.  "Ah si', sono quelli che fanno funky-rap
    sociale, no?  Niente  male,  anche  se  al primo ascolto..."
    "Veramente"  tossisce  Luca  "noi  facciamo...    del   rock
    italiano  al  limite  con  qualche  venatura pop" dice quasi
    scusandosi.

    "Ah, beh non importa sul  genere  poi ci si accorda.  Non e'
    quello l'importante al giorno d'oggi.  Come  del  resto  non
    sono  importanti  ne'  la  tecnica,  ne'  la  qualita' delle
    composizioni.  Voglio essere chiaro  con  voi: i successi si
    costruiscono a tavolino, non  in  studio  di  registrazione.
    Occorre  avere  delle  bella  facce  da copertina e da video
    musicale, testi e ritornelli che possano andare bene in ogni
    occasione, dalla festa tra amici al servizio televisivo.  Ma
    lo sapete quanti soldi ha  fatto Masini con "Brutta Stronza"
    solo  con  i  dischi  comprati  dai  ragazzi  per  le   loro
    ex-fidanzate  o con i passaggi televisivi in trasmissioni di
    satira?" "Beh, in effetti non ci avevo mai pensato"

    "Va beh, torniamo  a  noi,  purtroppo  non  ho molto tempo a
    disposizione e poi devo andare  a  comprarmi  una  carabina.
    Avete  una  foto dei componenti del gruppo?" "Si", dice Luca
    estraendo una busta dalla  tasca  "e'  qua dentro" "Fammi un
    po' vedere...  ah siete tutti molto giovani, bene...  Questo
    qua alto chi  e'?"  "E'  Paolo,  il  secondo  chitarrista...
    canta  anche  in  qualche pezzo" "Bene con qualche ritocco e
    qualche  tatuaggino  sulle  braccia  potra'  andare.  Questo
    mingherlino?" "E' Marco, il bassista.  E' il piu' giovane ma
    e' davvero molto bravo"

    "Ma non so, sembra ancora un bambino...  forse con un po' di
    palestra e un po' di  steroidi.   Beh,  vedremo  di  cavarci
    qualcosa.    Quest'altro   bruttino   allora  dev'essere  il
    batterista, giusto?  Meno male  cosi'  sta  dietro e si vede
    poco".  Una voce chiama dall'interfono.   E'  la  segretaria
    dalle unghie nere.

    "Dott.   Milani c'e' David Geffen per lei sul videotelefono"
    "Oh, cazzo  ancora  quel  culattone"  replica Sergio seccato
    "digli che sono impegnato a visionare una nuova band i Perla
    Madre...  anzi digli Pearl Mother cosi' lo facciamo stare un
    po' sulle spine" riattacca.  "Da quando gli distribuiamo noi
    i dischi le sue vendite in Italia sono triplicate, solo  che
    e'  un  tale scassapalle".  Io e Luca beviamo l'ultimo sorso
    del nostro chinotto.

    "Allora caro Luca,  credi  davvero  nella tua musica?" "Si',
    con tutta la mia anima" sobbalza  lui  con  un  lampo  negli
    occhi.   "Stronzate,  l'anima  non  c'entra niente in questo
    mestiere.   Angelo  puoi  uscire  qualche  minuto  che  devo
    spiegargli alcune cose a quattr'occhi?"

    "Si, va bene..."  balbetto nervosamente indirizzandomi verso
    il corridoio.  Sergio si alza  dalla  poltrona  e  si  va  a
    sedere sul bordo del tavolo proprio davanti a Luca.

    "Nel  nostro  ambiente  occorrono  sacrifici:  a seconda del
    periodo  questo  significa  tagliarsi  o  farsi  crescere  i
    capelli, cambiarne il colore in alcuni casi, farsi tatuare o
    mettere orecchini  al  naso  ed  in  ogni  caso scordarsi la
    propria integrita' musicale.  Il mercato richiede musica che
    pompa?  E noi aggiungiamo bassi all'inverosimile.   C'e'  la
    fase  delle  limonate  adolescenziali?   E  noi gli diamo le
    ballatone unplugged.  Il  secondo  segreto  e' fare notizia,
    fare parlare di se':  farsi  fotografare  con  ragazzine,  o
    ragazzini  non  fa  differenza,  di  16 anni.  Insomma Luca,
    occorre dare via il culo"  gli sussurra passandogli una mano
    tra i capelli "davvero morbidi,  e  hai  anche  delle  belle
    spalle"

    "Scusi ma... che sta facendo?"

    "Niente,  controllo  solo che tu abbia tutte le qualita' per
    salire su un palco del  festivalbar con i tuoi bei pantaloni
    di pelle attillati e..."

    Dal corridoio vedo la porta che si apre "Lei  e'...   e'  un
    figlio  di puttana" urla Luca affannosamente verso l'interno
    prima di correre via.  Mi passa davanti veloce senza nemmeno
    guardarmi.

    "Ma Luca?  Che cazzo succede,  dove diavolo scappi?" "Il tuo
    amico...  mi ha...  mi  ha  messo  una  mano  sui  coglioni,
    altroche' audizione, 'fanculo" "Va beh, ma dai sono cose che
    capitano,  malintesi.   Insomma  vuoi  o  no  entrare  nello
    show-biz?" "Si', ma non voglio che lo show-biz entri in me!"

    Mi   fermo   e   lo   guardo   scomparire  dietro  la  porta
    dell'ascensore.  Torno verso  l'ufficio  di Sergio ed entro.
    Stavolta senza bussare.

    "Meno di 10 minuti, quasi un  record"  gli  dico  mentre  si
    stappa  una  Bud.   "Gia', avevi proprio ragione...  era una
    cosa semplice"  "Lo  sai  che  difficilmente  mi  sbaglio in
    queste valutazioni"  "Ti  ha  gia'  dato  i  5  milioni  per
    l'audizione?"  "Per  chi  mi hai preso?" gli sorrido.  "Cosa
    dici, ci  scopiamo  la  troia  di  sotto  quando  finisce il
    turno?" "Va bene, ma si e' fatta tingere dall'ultima volta?"
    "No, e' un'altra"

    Apro il frigo-bar e mi stappo una Bud anch'io.   Vado  verso
    la finestra a guardare i piccioni che cagano sul mondo.

    "Forse il mondo ha quello che si merita" penso.

    IN UN ALTRO DOVE

    Da un'altra parte ci deve essere
    la mia anima che si riposa
    sulla sponda di un fiume - in piena -
    Da qualsiasi altra parte.
    Fosse anche sui resti di rovine
    di castelli in aria.


    MILLE NOTTI

    Fra mille sere trascorse
    ad ascoltare i passi della
    notte sempre piu' vicina
    scelgo la prima notte, che giunse a me,
    senza calpestare il giorno che finiva
    - vissuto solo  nell'intento ingenuo -
    di sfuggire all'immortalita'...
    di un'altra eternita'....


    FINCHE' UN FIORE

    .... L' ineffabile eternita'...
    caduca di un fiore
    sfiora l'immortalit...
    del giorno che
    non dimentica il
    desiderio d'inebriarsi
    nel trascorrere di un
    profumo ...
    di spegnersi nello
    sfiorire dell' ultimo
    colore ...
    Eppure - inesorabile -
    E' gia'... sbocciato
    il domani !


    CONTRASTI

    Il mattino si desta sull'immagine
    evanescente di un sogno gi... perduto ...
    di un gesto gi... compiuto ...
    Il giorno cresce nelle mani
    distratte dall'abitudine
    mortale di gesti eterni.
    Rifare - ogni volta - il domani
    disfatto dentro un letto ...
    Stanotte il mare e' straripato  e
    quel letto e' rimasto solo
    ad affrontare l'angosciosa spiaggia
    del trascorrere lento di un tempo gia'... perduto.
    L'insonnia sbatte le palpebre
    della finestra socchiusa ...
    e fra le ciglia incolte
    penetra -furtiva - nella casa
    della notte - l'aria stagnante
    dell'eternita'....
    La luce  ladra del dopo
    filtra attraverso lo squarcio
    nel lenzuolo bianco
     steso ad asciugare
    nel madido buio ...
     Anche stanotte... una vita ha pianto!


    IL SILENZIO DEL VERBO ESSERE

    Signore , a Te che nulla piu' sai
    di cio' che siamo ...
    A Te, che nella lontananza dell' esserci
    Ti rifiuti di sapere ancora ...
    A Te - ignaro di Te stesso -
    io rivolgo l' inutilita'...
    di un silenzio.
    Ascoltalo.
    E permettimi di tacere.
    Ascolta.
    Non volgere l' udire ad
    un altro dove ...
    Dove ci saro' anch' io!
    Signore, non impedirmi di
    tacere un verbo.
    Tuo, e' l' ignorare Te stesso.
    Lasciati derubare e
    ignora la mia colpa.
    Signore, volgi l' udire altrove ...
    Altrove, ci saro' ancora io!
    Ascolta il silenzio del mio
    verbo essere ...
    Io sono solo
    il mio ignoto ...


    GIORNI

    Giorni come fiori
    da cogliere ... o da lasciare
    appassire.
    Giorni da regalare ... o da
    rubare.
    Giorni ricevuti - avvolti in un freddo
    involucro trasparente.
    Giorni fragili ...
    giorni di cristallo.
    Giorni colorati , sfumati,
    spruzzati di neve
    macchiati di carbone.
    Giorni roridi di rugiada
    fradici di pioggia.
    Giorni di lacrime.
    Giorni in fila, allineati, squadrati
    in cerchio, giorni assemblati.
    Giorni sparpagliati ...
    seminati dal vento e raccolti da
    mani tremanti.
    Giorni di brezza, scarmigliati.
    Giorni spettinati, disordinati,
    lacerati, sbranati, sezionati.
    Giorni dettati - ascoltati -
    Giorni gridati ...
    sussurrati.
    Giorni di silenzi taciuti.
    Giorni di fiabe e di realt....
    Giorni di bugie.
    Giorni inventati.
    Giorni creati.
    Giorni di tempo.
    Fiori di vento ...


    STANCHEZZA

    Le mani avvinghiate
    al cuore ...
    sul petto mille lacerazioni
    troppe ferite
    infinito tutto ...
    Voler che sia l'ultimo
    per lasciar ricadere giu'-
    - sfinite e stanche - le braccia
    ad afferrare l'anima ...
    finalmente sentir esaurito
    il  niente.


    ILLUSIONI

    Fu l' ululare di un cane , forse
    legato all' assenza di una carezza,
    a risvegliare il merlo addormentato.

    Dal nido si levo' un frullio
    d'ali spezzate, a ridestare
    la penna fra le mie mani.

    E mentre tento di appuntare
    questo momento, ecco che
    gia'... tutto sfugge in un altro
    domani.

    Ed il merlo - sazio di cielo -
    ritorna al nido
    credendosi sfamato.
    Mentre la mia mano, ancor
    piu' vuota di un mano tesa
    nella preghiera ...  si crede
    colma di Dio ...
    e si chiude ...
    per seguir la sera.


    INNOCENZA

    Affogavo in un sorso d' aria
    solo perche' non avevo le ali ...
    Irripetibile ebbrezza di un giorno
    innocente che ancora non conosceva
    la sera.
    Caddi dal nido e ...
    credevo di volare .
    In un istante fini' l'eternita'....


    E' LO STESSO ...

    Ho speso una parola...
    poi un' altra ... e un' altra ancora ...
    Nessuno mi  ascolta ...
    Non importa ...
    mi sto comprando il silenzio.


    DISCORDANZE

    A ricordarmi di esserci - a volte -
    ci pensa anche "l' avere".
    Ho paura!
    E sono ... sola!
    E' ancora estate ...  per poco ancora.
    Era  autunno ... o quasi ...
    almeno fino a ieri.
    Corro incontro al nemico,
     solo per essere raggiunta e
     superata.
    Mi fermo ad incontrarmi ... e
    fingo di non apparire.
    Nonostante tutto ...
    forse ci saro'.


    PIOGGIA DI DOLORE

    Ho riudito la melodia che un giorno
    la pioggia compose solo per me.
    Per sentirmi ancora parte del mondo
    recitai versi senza senso.
    Pioggia battente, insistente ...
    che non ne vuol sapere di cadere
    sul mio giardino di sassi.
    Non voglio essere padrona
    del dolore
    né schiava di una solitudine
    senza rancore.
    Rimpianti di chi non vede piu'
    realzzarsi il sogno di una stella -
    che cade al di la' di un deserto
    senza orizzonti -
    Preghiera di un giorno
    e di una notte ...
    Preghiera di un anno ...
    di una vita.
    Un secolo si consuma
    in una lacrima sola.

    "DAYBOOK"

    I prefer sure awareness without precedent.
                                                        P. Neruda

    I
    We have conspired together to create a thing
    that we have called Poetry and we have told
    each other that life is about it, this Poetry.
    I believe now that we may have made a mistake,
    that we may have made this thing called Poetry
    to excuse ourselves from mutability, from living.
    Let me now suggest that, if we can,
    we end our desperate devotions at this misplaced
    altar, and admit to ourselves that all we really
    do, and all we need to do, is sing
    a little, whistle out or hum a bit.
    The only scripture, I'm trying to say, is recited
    by the day itself and all we can
    do is listen to it, leaning up
    against a seawall in our good coat
    with nothing to do for the rest of the day.

    II
    It's in terms of the day we need to think
    the day's the universe's
    clear link, the element from which
    vast and hidden words are constituted,
    the blocks on which the temporal road unwinds,
    unraveling like a spool of blue thread
    into the yellow umbrellas of fennel that climb
    the cliffs seaside to watch that great tumbler,
    the ocean, roll over to zero.

    III

    This is a poem about the rest of the day,
    the time that stretches comfortably before us
    with no expectations, the time after which
    we have done those things which justify us,
    when we are free.  It is this rest of the day
    for which we have truly worked.
    Some things we cannot live without
    a sense of meaning something, the dew-collecting
    spider webs that radiate like cold chandeliers,
    vibrating with dawn in the chill fields by
    the sea, the delicacy and strength of love
    but when we have done
    and seen and felt, taken and given
    enough, then we can stand somewhere alone
    (and for this I would recommend Anywhere)
    and watch the world flow around our
    arms and legs as though we were standing
    backward to a strong rushing water
    until we take a notion to lean slowly back
    and let ourselves be carried down the day
    like a leaf down a broad stream.


    "THE ORANGE OF EUROTAS"

    after George Seferis

    1.
    The half-moon, a smoky golden boat
    beached on the black gravel of the night sky
    in a notch between two buttes
    over Fairfield.  A semi
    hauling new cars down a siding road
    flashes its lights across the face
    of a boarded-up feed store.
    Refineries smolder over dead water.
    We are going down to the shore at Halicarnassus.

    2.
    Can the man who swam in the water
    be the same one who now reads the paper?
    I stood on the lower terrace
    of the bank of the Willamette,
    its clay green waters swollen with rain,
    alone in the past, bored and useless,
    alone now and in life.
    And I looked up to the air
    and I saw the air in amazement.

    3.
    After the bridge we stopped
    at the Iziz Han,
    superb architecture, this old han,
    two fireplaces in the middle
    with four pillars each.
    Now it's used as a sheepfold.
    Outside the weather has turned grey.
    We slept at Bursa.

    La luna
    se ne ando' all'improvviso
    e il vento
    si fermo'
    La pioggia
    smise di cadere
    sull'erba alta del prato
    E nel silenzio della notte
    solo una stella
    piccola e spaurita
    resto' a vegliare
    sui nostri pensieri


    Il primo giorno di primavera
    vittima della noia
    il canarino della signora Gina
    s'e' ammazzato
    Non sopportava
    quella condanna a vita
    L'hanno trovato cosi'
    ad ali spiegate
    fra i semi d'avena
    sparsi nella gabbia
    L'hanno messo nella terra
    di un vaso di gerani
    Non cantera' piu'
    al sole del mattino
    ma
    avra' sempre fiori freschi


    Lontano lontano
    sotto una pietra fredda
    nella nebbia
    il tuo volto non c'e' ancora
    ma questo non conta
    questo e' superfluo
    "Come stai?
    Ti senti solo?"
    "A dire il vero
    non e' la solitudine che mi spaventa
    anzi non c'e' piu' nulla
    che mi puo' preoccupare
    C'e' solo silenzio
    e non si vede niente"
    "Io pensavo
    che si vedesse tutto
    e che ci fosse
    tant'altra gente"
    "Chissa'
    forse fra un po'
    potro' vedere
    e ci sara' qualcuno da incontrare
    Ci vuole tempo"
    "E' cosi' triste
    Mi fa paura"
    "E' meno peggio
    di quel che si puo' pensare
    In fondo
    morire e' un po' partire"


    Fra molti anni
    quando i tuoi capelli saranno bianchi
    la tua faccia rugosa
    e i tuoi seni appassiti
    ti amero' ancora di piu'
    e ce ne andremo
    a guadare il mare
    fra gli ulivi
    in autunno
    e resteremo li'
    senza parlare
    nella luce dorata d'ottobre
    soli
    senza pensare
    che il tempo se n'e' andato
    a quante scarpe abbiamo consumato
    e agli alberi da frutta
    che ci hanno dato
    solo qualche pesca rinsecchita
    e ogni istante
    ci aiutera' a capire
    se serve a qualcosa
    vivere


    Sognami stanotte
    Sogna il mio sguardo
    che si posa su di te
    Sogna le mie braccia che ti stringono
    e le mie mani
    che accarezzano i tuoi capelli corti
    Ed io sognero' te
    i tuoi occhi profondi
    il tuo dolcissimo sorriso
    e quei meravigliosi spaghetti alla carbonara
    che solo tu sai fare
    Sognami stanotte
    e anch'io ti sognero'


    La pioggia di settembre
    cade in fretta e dura poco
    La pioggia di febbraio
    e' fredda,dolce e silensiosa
    e non si ferma mai
    Ad agosto
    piove sul mare
    A marzo un po' dovunque
    A novembre
    piove in citta'
    e quand'e' buio
    le strade sono lucide
    come in quella canzone
    Vorrei vivere in un posto
    dove piove tutto l'anno
    Basta cieli azzurri
    e tramonti di fuoco
    Basta cieli stellati
    e lune sorgenti
    La pioggia che cade
    mi dice che esisto

    "BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE"

    Two tone automobile lust I rolled out of the bone yard
    three am onto burnt oil streets the smell made me think
    of over cooked flank steak mixed with a toxic fruit smell
    on the highway I let her eat till she was full
    nothing but crackling Tex Mex favorites on the radio
    from the boarder the radio glowing against stabs of lighting
    and rolls of thunder a couple of prowlers caught
    me bottle in hand ten miles from the Mexico I split my
    skull in two by my own hand nothing left behind
    except an empty cold jail cell waiting to hold another's
    bad luck and trouble like so many times before.


    "GARE D'AUSTERLITZ"

    He remembered the dull steel of the luggage cart
    the fact it was for free you didn't have to pay
    like in the airports and train stations in the states
    he loved the long taxi ride in and the cars filled
    with people who couldn't speak his language
    these cars were small with bright reds and greens
    like pieces of candy on wheels and none of the road
    signs spoke to him and he loved it because
    he didn't have anything to say back he had come to die
    with different hands not the same ones that grabbed
    the luggage cart years ago with her the first time
    in their own
    dreamland together now his last time here in hell
    or anywhere
    he tipped the driver and checked into his room
    across the street was the train station and *this*
    a train station would be the last thing he'd ever see
    he felt for the gun and fingered it for a long time
    he'd gotten it past customs its plastic didn't show up
    what if they had found it he would still die they couldn't
    stop him he pushed the barrel to his wind pipe
    the sound of a police siren bleeped on and off down
    the street back in the states most people were getting up
    he wondered if he remembered to stop the newspaper
    he pulled the trigger the pain of his misspent
    life laid bare
    in a pile of copper colored blood and tissue he watched
    while housekeeping cleaned up the mess the sun starting
    to rise and the woman's eyes stopping to rest on the
    train station
    the sign out front saying "cour d' arrivee."


    "WHY NOY?"

    He eased his bare ass into the drivers seat his skin
    sliding on the cool
    mauve colored cloth the morning's cold air rippling
    down his body
    key in the ignition he cranked her up and drove
    to the post office
    nothing on but loose white socks and brown loafer
    style dress shoes
    the man that sold them to him said they'd be perfect
    for any occasion
    he swung his bare legs out the car and walked
    to his p.o. box
    ignoring the stares and grins nothing in the mail
    except the usual
    fucking bills they caught him a half a block from
    the p.o the
    red and blue lights of a sane society in his rear
    view mirror
    he gave up without a struggle the hand cuffs cold impersonal
    on his criminal skin when they asked him why
    he did it he shrugged
    his shoulders and answered why not? They let him out
    ninety days later
    looking around his house he felt he had changed
    something what
    he wasn't quite sure.

    "ETUDE"

    In a prosperous German town
    somewhere in Bismarck Strasse
    I watched a performance
    of your fingers drumming out
    on the table Chopin
    and when they finally stopped
    you gave me such a look, as
    I lurched forward, head steeped
    in romance; was it the drink,
    the bottle of rose, that made
    your frown a smile?
    But nevertheless, you continued
    we found we had so much in common
    I loved Russian literature, you
    had studied Slavonic languages,
    you had even seen my favourite
    movie, Chung King Express,
    and when I came back from the
    customary dance with the bride,
    you had moved to another table,
    was it Dutch courage that made me
    give you my address?
    Will you write now? Or will you
    be forever be pulling out the slip of
    paper and think of writing, whatever
    the case, I'd like to think that
    this an epistolary equivalent
    to the movie, like when the Chinese
    girl plays the CD again and again

    "LUCIA & VITTORIO"

    O.K. there was a day when we did love and dream
    read verse by candle light,
    and sleep by the side of a mountain stream,
    and looked at stars in the Winter night,
        but this was long before
    the advent of the aeroplane
    in those lost days of yore.
    Now nothing is quite the same,
    when we kiss, above there is a satellite,
    and down below we are caught
    by a passing car's headlamp beam;
    our inner secrets are published
    in what was the ethereal air,
    and in seconds our love is rubbished
    by strangers on the Net.

    However, there is hope it would seem
    as multi-media has of yet
    been unable to comprehend simple irony,
    too slippery, and too subtle is real love
    that it transcends and taxes the virtual glove
    that is supposed to substitute your caress
    with a higher and yet erotic geometry,
    but simply does not know which way to go,
    in Chaos programmed, it touches a rude dream,
    and then let's go, unable to make up its mind
    whether it is a woman or a man; in a stream
    of data it touches the Tree of Knowledge
    and recoils later with guilt
    meanwhile Lucia and Vittorio they kiss
    and the skies Light up, the birds do sing,
    the cherubs come out to play, so sweet
    is the Victory of their love over this
    sad and ridiculously crude modernity.

    "CODA DI RONDINE"

    Siamo al fondu:
    ormai un contrasto inesistente
    si allarga all'aria anzi
    alla sua lama ma
    senza aberrazione.
    Ecco il daylight a fine.
    L'alone ne vela? il volo
    l'antialo lo lavero' a posteriori! Ad
    libitum s'inquadra il suo trascinamento; eh si'
    perchp quella lama poi tira
    la figura
    e ne fa intreccio
    ciop extension inconsueta
    per noi DIABOLICI ingeritori
    di coscienze volanti, che
    solo cosi'
    ci potremmo purgare.
    La sua acutanza
    ne caratterizza l'azione:
    il bazooca si becca e
    del becco fa bell-howell
    e si frega. Da solo
    si dissolve. E noi inghiottiamo
    il fegatello.

    SCENDENDO A PIEDI IN UN TRANQUILLO POMERIGGIO
    con quel
    viso fatuo
    fanno irruzione senza neppure
    la gioiosa liturgia
    con la carne

    come una specie di corpo, inamissibile e guasto....
    un pettirosso circondato
    dai raggi dorati
    nascosto nel cuore
    rompe la voce dentro al coro
    ..................................
    con occhi chiusi si sappia
    ascoltare cio' che le profezie
    celebrano........


    ..LA CARTA BRUCIAVA ED ERANO IN BALLO UN SACCO DI
    COSE.....

    sul fuoco bianco
    la mano, e le sue labbra
    un soffio nel giorno ( la paura )
    terra in cui i volti scorrono
    sempre su quel fondo azzurro
    ......gia' un altro mondo
    come se le rovine di "quel" passato
    fossero partorite iscritte
    nella parete d'acqua


    UN ESULE DAL SE STESSO NELLA CAMERA DELLO ZAR

    ricordo la mano nel miele
    e un avanzo di bosco
    nascosto dietro alla casa
    poi, le armi troppo rauche, troppo rapide
    per la felicita' dei sensi
    Ulisse nudo furbo
    con il cazzo pieno di pus, e' sottoterra morto
    ma anche con l'idea di tempo verso quest'epoca
    che pencola sul fianco.

    Tra i massacri sensuali, i lauri tremano
    intorno a Virgilio
    anima come uccello delle indie
    liberera' il corpo senza morte.....


    FARE SPAZIO, PREPARARE LUOGHI DI RACCOLTA

    ora l'occhio aperto
    che scopra la radura, abbandoni
    l'arcaico riflesso scuro
    quello nascosto, quello che ci sporca

    sulla pietra acuta, il sangue
    come in un cratere di vino nuovo se ne vola via
    napalm piu' demode' del rossetto
    colante nella corrente degli astri
    in quel corpo che si allunga sul muro


    IL PITTORE S'INDUGIA IN QUESTO SUO MONDO

    Sandy, piedi da tartaruga
    quindici anni, spiaggia inverno
    con la lingua nelle pieghe delle labbra
    dal cuore sulle mie labbra
    il fiore bianco di latte
    falce di luna, tu senti questa eco?
    lama di rasoio che corre da un mare all'altro..


    il sonno adesso all'esterno della pelle


    SUL MONDO DELLE COSE OLTRE LE COSE

    il fuoco salta e lecca il cielo
    il cuore, veleno piu' terribile del nulla
    i pesci rossi possono amare un fantasma?
    Dio nella tua gola
    Lui manda per aprire vie
    nelle sfere della follia
    la malattia dicono e' il battito dell'aorta
    morva nelle fosse nasali
    il grano di polvere , un rifugio d'estate.


    BAR COLOR PORPORA

    quel fucile incipriato
    trama fili rosa in mezzo alle dorature episcopali
    gli sguardi barocchi spinti nel tempo
    scoprono gli spettri indignati dell'eta' adulta
    Londra, li' alla fine del viaggio
    j lennon legato per le braccia
    allampanato, amato fino ai denti...


    MAGELLANO  IL SUO CORPO COME LUOGO

    si sparsero i suoi occhi
    quando un mulo caricato d'oro
    testa di Zeus cinta d'allor
    raccontava il mattino dispari
    con i fianchi rugosi
    muovendosi nel vento


    CORUS

    i serpenti profetici
    vanno nell'arcobaleno di smeraldo
    sanguinanti delle mestruazioni


    LA  MALATTIA VERSO LA VORAGINE

    i fenicotteri rosa
    poi una casa abbandonata su di un treno
    e il mondo urlava
    quando un revolver gli veniva scaricato
    nella ferita


    COLLERICA, L'ESTATE CALA SULLA TERRA

    e le sue guance
    a volte una luce di sole
    oh allora c'e' da morirne
    e le sue guance
    a volte una luce di sole
    lascia cadere il serpente mucoso
    sulla calce sfaldata


    LA PRIMA PARTE DEL RITO HA TERMINE

    il mattino
    con silenzio opaco
    fa fiele nel sangue
    inghiotte lavoratori
    in un cerchio di fuoco
    ondulanti al capezzale di Cristo


    TERAPIA, IN QUESTO SPAZIO DIABOLICO

    Adamo mangio' il frutto in piedi
    davanti alla donna
    dopo e' andato ad aspettare il cane
    con le gambe penzoloni nel vuoto
    il cane nero
    in cerca di polvere e di sabbia


    TERAPIA, IN QUESTO SPAZIO DIABOLICO  2

    Offrendo una finzione
    guardavo l'acqua
    piena di lastre di vetro
    troppe cose con molta durezza
    e infine durando a lungo il cerchio del mio amore
    con lo stesso volto sono rimasto sepolto
    chissa' dove


    TERZO MILLENNIO

    passano i treni
     sfilandosi in silenzio
     dalla nebbia
    con la schiena contro il cielo
    diventano giganteschi
    si attacano alla terra come ad una calamita
    passano all'orizzonte
    ora silenziosi ora rumorosi
    in cerca di vele bianche o
    di un tramonto
    o di una
    eclissi violacea
    quasi continuassero a raccontare una vecchia storia


    CIELI SENZA CORPI

    si trascinano a rovescio
    nel tempo profondo
    ecco cade una stella
    a obbligare il viso ad aprirsi
    senza che l'albero nasconda
    la foresta nella foresta....


    IL SOLE PARE FREDDO,I FIORI APPASSITI

    un semplice riflesso della persiana
    poi e' la distesa di sempre
    sul fondo di un acquario
    a lungo il punto sacro aveva accolto il suo martirio
    un cespuglio di rovi avrebbe accolto il suo corpo
    lasciandolo maturare all'aria aperta
    al colore bianco del neon
    ecco la bomba
    come una sciarpa di nebbia
    nel seno della terra


    IL SOLE PARE FREDDO, I FIORI APPASSITI, MA SENZA ALCUN
    MOTIVO

    il sole alla fine sanguina in bianco
    il suo occhio
    nei regni delle sabbie
    scompone la fede
    non riuscendo a vedersi semplice stella
    quando la giovinezza morira' nel suo ricordare
    comincera' a piegare le ginocchia per mancanza di eternita'
    sbiancate  le radici lampeggiano
    nel tramonto


    NELLE CAMERE DEGLI UOMINI INSONNI, DELLE DONNE
    INSONNI

    lei sara' fucilato!
    gli ho ripetuto, lei sara' fucilato
    muoia tranquillamente
    mostrando il petto al plotone
    io dico e' soltanto il silenzio
    a rimbalzare sulla pietra
    lui ha gridato
    come fosse una ragazza che offre la sua verginita'


    NUDO SUL LETTO DURO

    riposa il grappolo sulle foglie fulve
    e le tue labbra rosa
    dimenticate  su quell'argine
    lungo il cielo
    il vecchio troppo stanco
    per proteggersi dalle frustate
    si accorse che nel suo pregare
    diventava pietra
    raccogli il fuoco
    nella ferita,
    la sera, tra fiori di perle
    s'incolla ancora di piu' sulla pelle
    il mare cazzo balordo a contare i vortici della tua corsa
    poi l'occhio carico di odio
    ti parla sotto le nuvole
    di eroi
    sul loro bordo merdoso
    cosi' fedeli e taglienti


    NON SARA' PER CASO UNA VASCA DA BAGNO?

    ruvida nera
    l'ora del giorno
    preme contro alla pioggia
    il tempo ancora
    incastrato nella pietra bianca
    il sole avra' gli anni
    di quando sorridevamo
    tra le ciglia
    senza rumore
    il vento soffia sul mio corpo
    quelle nuvole colorate
    e il sonno color  carbone
    la' nascosto nelle polveri del deserto'


    DAL VERO, IL PANE PROBABILMENTE, E' NERO

    il filo della falce
    ha ragione di dire che
    infine non basta un eroe
    secco sniffato
    poi comico sul rogo dei fiammiferi


    VA A GETTARE I RIFIUTI NELL'IMMONDEZZAIO

    ecco la cellula che scoppia
    prima che la luce divina
    lecchi il nudo cervello.....


    L'UCCISIONE DEL PORCO E' SOPRATTUTTO UNA FESTA

    nascosti nel labirinto vermoso
    morti senza nessuno al capezzale
    morti nell'apocalisse
    cercando un pensiero attraverso i secoli
    nel boccale la bruciatura del giorno
    avido
    si' lei bussa, si' lei si stende
    grida, radente al liquido
    " puoi uscire dalla scatola ossea"
    il corpo se volete
    e' una landa devastata
    rubate, rubate le balene
    e' cattivo il tempo
    e l'uomo e' una malattia

    "PIOVE"

    Piove sul cortile
    Piazza Duomo
    e lava via le carte
    a terra
    ed i passanti occasionali
    gente mai vista
    su improbabili divani
    prende
    una luce mistica
    il monumento a lato
    gronda di tempo
    andato

    di un logoro
    cappotto


    "GIORNATA DI GIUGNO"

    Aria metallica
    scende piano
    cola il grigio sulle cose
    dietro le finestre
    accese.
    Delirio di pioggia.
    Acerbo sinesteta
    volge gli occhi al fuori
    pensieri che rotolano lenti.
    E' loro natura.

    Il fine delle cose detta il ritmo
    Il fare delle cose resta indietro


    "VERRA' UN TEMPO"

    Verra' un tempo per le gioie mancate
    La vendetta di rimpianti passati
    Verra' un tempo per chiedere scusa
    di quelli che chiaman peccati
    Verra' un tempo per l'uomo di pace
    Ed un tempo per l'uomo di guerra
    Verra' un tempo per chiedere scusa
    di quelli che chiaman reati
    Verra' un tempo per il verde dei prati
    Ed un tempo per il grigio del cielo
    E scorre sulle mani il mio tempo
    Lasciandomi orme sul viso

    Verra' un tempo per l'alba e il tramonto
    Simbolo falso di eterna certezza
    Verra' un tempo di mura annerite
    dal fumo delle nostre menzogne
    Verra' un tempo per cogliere l'invito
    di lasciare una traccia di noi
    Sulla polvere di una piccola via
    che il vento ha spesso battuto
    Verra' il tempo di calare il sipario
    restare muti e impauriti
    chiedendo ubriachi di vita
    E' giunto dunque il mio tempo?

                           of roses
                        as having lips

                         Feet, knees
                          thighs and

                        the Lover sips?

                 (Traduzione di Vittorio Curtoni)

                           Posso parlare
                            delle rose
                        come avessero labbra

                          Piedi, ginocchia
                              cosce e

                        l'Innamorato beve?

                         si sono chiusi con

                           Dolce Signora
                                sa:

                          L'uomo raccoglie
                               il seme
                            che ha sparso.



    "SHE'S COME TO ME"
    by Antonio Bellomi

    She's come to me in a glorious day
    With love and trust and sure say
    She's like a clinging rock in a frothy sea
    She's mine to behold and revere
    I am hers for life and beyond!


    "TRANSATLANTIC CROSSING"
    by E. G. Horovitz and Gaetano Giordano

    Transatlantic crossing,
    poetry standing guard.
    Deep streams flow from my dreams,
    of the not spoken soul's silences
    captured by the distance between us
    I am prisoner to its war.

    Where  could I meet your mental peace's petals ?
    I would love to find them in one of yours - virtual neverlands...
    Do they grow in your garden's headdress, knotted in your
    past's non existence?
    or do they web your soul, tangled in trust to another, me stessa /
    myself?

    Infinite lost - my selves - call me from thousands and thousands of mad
    words - I hear their voices in the cone of your shell.
    The ocean stands divided, fissure to my soul:
    Parted by the channel of your love, so deep.

    So, we are writing "Transatlantic crossing"...
    Good ! Poetry standing guard ?
    yes poetry standing guard,
    like soldiers while the Red Sea parts and
    allows our love to wash ashore,
    do you see the image now, mio amore?
    E' uno specchio, this image - my love-
    it's a mirror  nel quale incontrarti -
    e' il tepore in cui ti voglio sfiorare: siamo noi
    questa immagine amore
    siamo noi che incontriamo noi stessi.
