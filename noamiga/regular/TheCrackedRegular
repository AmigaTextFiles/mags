@Node 2 "Editorial"

Hello people, and welcome to the first edition of "@{"The Cracked Regular" system "run >nil: fastview 6"}"!
You might wonder what a demented soul I am as I started this "diskmag".
Well I don't care! You can wonder as much as you want, I won't tell how
demented I am. What a nice world, "demented".
Enough about that. This is by the way our "Friday the 13 special edition".
A very special day for us, as it is the day we go out and hunt down each
others mothers with tri-forks! The one to kill the most mothers gets a lamb.
Which is nice.
"The Cracked Regular" is a "diskmag" for the people (and a little bit by the
people). If you have anything you want to say to the world, don't hesitate
to contact us, and we will se what we can do.
This first edition is as you might have noticed not in tip top shape. As
many 1st ed. mags might be. But no need to fret, the standard will surly
rise! (Yeah, right!) As winter is turning into fresh Warzone figures I wonder
if should not have eaten that fruit. But that is another issue. The makers of
this mag are all Norwegian. You might have noticed this! But you do not need
to be afraid, by reading this mag you do not become a vegetarian. We
Norwegians have a hi standard for quality, as you will se in this mag.
Yes this is yet another "diskmag" that is for free. How can do it (for free
that is)? Easy, we just write for the hell of it. Be honest, who the hell
would pay crap for this mag. But on the other hand, we can write crap if we
want to, because why should we care, we don't get paid!
But we do have an advertisement spot in the mag which brings us the fortunes!
This mag was written in the course of very few days as we wanted to release
it before Friday the 13th. We had to scout a little for contributing writers
and ended up with... Well you can se for your self. If you want to be a
contributing writer and get a free advertisement spot in our mag, be sure
to contact us. Anything else you want to say, just contact us.

Many hugs and all of that shit:
Sorg!!!

@Node 4 "E.R.S.98"

So what is @{E.R.S.98 system "run >nil: fastview 3"}you might ask. Maybe not, but I am sure you have some
thought in what E.R.S.98 is. But you are all wrong! I think. Well maybe some
of you are right. Like members of E.R.S.98 who are stupid enough in reading
this.
If you have seen any of our work, you might think we are a demogroup. But
you are all wrong!!! We can't be a demogroup, our demo's suck!!! No I am just
kidding. Our demo's are the best in the world. And they are for free!!!
Ah, except for the 'Spanky Girl...' intro/demo where you should send money to
one of 'Spanky's' friends, or something like that.
You are still wondering what E.R.S.98 is aren't you. Or else you wouldn't
have read this far. You must be one stupid blarmy...
WHAT IS E.R.S.98!!! You scream in my ear. Maybe not, but still it's quite
tantalising to se how long this stupid article has become. It should be quite
simple to answer the question!
Okay, lets look at the facts. We have made some demo's, a song and a remix.
We are in the proses of making a game. We are talking software here. We
have a name: E.R.S.98. If you are a hard-core fan you'll have seen that one
of our demo's (Raven) is made by: E.R.S.97. This is indeed the same as
E.R.S.98! We don't change names each year. The 98 in our name is a variable,
which represents the year of making. So what does the E, R & S stand for? If
you think you know the answer, don't write it down and put it in a envelope.
And if your answer is the correct answer you might become a V.I.P. reader of
this mag!!!
If you are still wondering what the hell I am going on about. E.R.S.98 is
gang of lazy bastard "artists", who do as they like!!!

of heroes villains and epic battles and the lot to be included.
Aprox not finished.

-The intro to O.J. (Why is this taking so long?)

-A couple of other games and tributes (in the forms of demos and songs)

We are always working on new ideas for games and demos and the lot, but as
we are so lazy we newer do anything else than plan ahead, because when we
plan everything ahead there is nothing to do right know!!! Genius!!!

@Node 6 "Sorg"

Yes! This rules! This is possibly the best diskmag ever. But that is my
opinion. And that is what this thing called "Words from the gang" is all
about. My opinions, and the opinions of the other members of E.R.S.98. It's
not to be seen as the opinion of the mag, or something like that. That's what
CU-Amiga writes in "Points of View". Well what do they mean. Okay they don't
want us to misunderstand and think that what they think is what the mag
thinks. But hey, what view does the mag have. When you are a regular reader
of CU, like me you get to sort of know these people. And you can't help to
"feel" their view's as a mark of what CU stands for. They shouldn't be afraid
to give the mag the strength of opinion. They should try to discipline the
readers. The standard Amiga user is terribly spoiled. Me included. The
quality of the software on the coverdisk's and Aminet is great. So great that
people like me don't need to buy almost any software. Now I wouldn't say that
that's a bad thing. For the user and the casual developer, Freeware and the
likes is a heaven. But there are the other products as well. Why should I buy
the newest version of Imagine when it's going to come on a mag if it doesn't
get support. I have quite a powerful graphics workstation, software wise. And
all of it has come from coverdisks. Okay it isn't the newest version. But who
cares's, once it was, and it was good enough for people then. Before when I
was beginning to use Amiga, there where never anything other than lame games
on coverdisk, or extremely craped at demos of one or another program.
We had a local shop who sold Amiga hard/software. I was interested in
graphics, music, programming, you name it. And I strongly thought of buying
Real-3d and other then quite professional software. But I was then quite
young and poor, and couldn't even shell out bussfare money. As time went I
got the money and software far more powerful then what I had ever expected.
But it was for free, on coverdisks. The last time I bought any software for
my Amiga was a year ago when I bought Spacefarming, a Shareware game for £3.
The only software I am thinking on buying right now is Foundation. Yet
another game. I feel I only buy games. Hell even Octamed Soundstudio was a
covermount. Let me just se here... Looking threw my pile of original software
DSS8 is the only none game software I have ever bought, and I don't even play
that much games nowadays on the Amiga (maybe I should buy some new ones?).
Many people ask me why the hell I use an Amiga. I say why the hell should you
care, be satisfied with your "PC". And stop trying to "savour" me from the
"lame" Amiga. I don't try to "bless" them with the "wonders" of the Amiga. As
I said I don't play that much games, so I don't need a games machine like the
"PC". This may or may not seem harsh. But a loth of people I know who use
"PC"'s, use them strictly for gaming. The few people I know who want more
from a machine than gaming are going to buy Amigas in the near future when
the PowerPC "revolution" is more stable. They say they are feed up with
inferior machinery, and that makes me proud.
So what is Amiga International doing? Nothing special. Talking a loth,
waiting. In the mean time have to rely on 3th party developers for Hardware
which probably is the best thing right now, but the Amiga needs a strong
base of software, none game included, if they want to even be close to
competing with other machines. They can on the other hand just let there be
a sort of everlasting support to the loyal Amiga user of these times, which
is cute and all of that, but not rely realistic. Amigas biggest problem is
ignorance. Most people think the Amiga is long lost. More than dead. Some
people know people like me and know's otherwise. But that doesn't help much.
Many people look the Amiga worse than they look at the C-64. Maybe they feel
I am threatening they're stable life with a gaming machine which has the
option of doing video-titleing as well (narf). If you mention the C-64 people
get a whole different reaction. Most become nostalgic. But none I have seen
gets threatened by the fact that I mention the C-64. Of course not, it's to
inferior compared to today uses. But an Amiga might still look threatening to
a man who has been sort of happy whit his "PC" for so long and has invested
a loth of time and money in it. It should take quite a loth of convincing if
you are going to make that man admit that all of his time and money was a
waste, buy this Amiga, it's so much better. Most people just become overlie
protective of their "PC" and then again their self.
I'm glad I bought an Amiga when I did. If I had waited awhile and had
more money, I would have probably got convinced into buying a "PC". And would
probably still be using it, and thought the Amiga was long gone, more than
dead.

But the Amiga lies not dead, but dreaming...

@Node B "Shocked!!!"

Hello, I write this to say I am shocked! What has happened to the dumpsters
here in Norway. It's terrible, where is a man supposed to sleep in these cold
winter days. While I sleep comfortably here in my home I can't stop thinking
of those pore drunk souls that are freezing their ass of in these cold, cold
Norwegian winter nights. A normal kid could easily die of frostbite. And
what are the politicians doing? Sending the price of soda sky high. I se
this commercial on the tely that some mall is selling Cola for 10 NOK
(discount!!?). Now the youth of today can't afford these step soda prises
which Bondevik has given us (so that we shouldn't get fat) so they have to by
beer instead (they can't afford anything else). Sorrow wrenched my soul when
this christian bastard (Bondevik) got the power in this country. He is so
cruel (and christian), he should be terminated, but because of these soda
prices I can't afford a hitman (not even a pocket knife so that I could
kill'm myself). We should do something, and that know. Before all the
children in this god forsaken (probably not!) country hit the dirt. But what
can we do. We can analyse the situation. We have an enemy: Bondevik and The
christian Folks Party. (which is the party which Bondevik governs!) First KFP
, well enough about them they are weak christians. Lets anallice Bondevik: In
English his name reads: Creek of peasants. His fucking name is Creek of
peasants. What does this mean. Industrialisation? No to long. I think it
means inbreed. His hole  family is inbreeds. I say lets kill the bastard
before he commits more crimes to the common human citizen (and cats!) Talking
about pets, have anybody seen my cat lately, it's been dead for a while and I
can't seem to find it. Any suggestions, contact us!

@Node C "Vampire?"

Dreamlands Stavanger seamed to be a sure bet winner. But it wasn't. Many
rumours quickly emerged, so I decided to interview the man behind it all,
Piet, to get the true story, of the demise of Dreamlands Stavanger.

Many of you may ask what is Dreamlands. Dreamlands is a shop witch sells all
sorts of gaming merchandise. That's none computer games. Strange you might
think. What do you mean, scrabble? No not quite, roleplaying games,
cardgames, board games, strategy games of all sorts. All though Dreamlands
sold some books and videos, "analogue" games was it's main business. There
are many of these sort of shops around in the world, but I am to tell the
story of one of the most anticipated shops in the history of Stavanger.

The subject:

Name: Piet Skjæveland
Former occupation: Executive leader of Dreamlands Stavanger.
Age: None to matter.

Ed- Aside from your occupation, what do you normally do with you life?
Piet- I play all sorts of games, roleplaying, cardgames, computergames,
you name it. I also have lately been playing more Internet based games like
ChronX
Ed- What do you think about the current uprising of computer conversions,
and Internet specific gaming?
Piet- I think it's positive. If a game nowadays doesn't have net
possibilities, it often isn't good enough. People have to have a multiplayer
option. I think the domination of computer/Internet games is a positive
thing.
Ed- So you are not afraid it will kill the "analogue" games?
Piet- Not really. Games like roleplaying games cannot be reproduced on a
computer. And you can't quite play a roleplaying game like "Call of Cthulhu"
over the Internet. You could, but it would be stupid, and quite to
expensive!
Ed- How do you like the share/freeware concept. Should all games on the net
be free?
Piet- It's positive. I don't mind it being free or almost free. Many games
today. Especially in cases like the cardgame Magic. You have to have a
load of money to start as a serious gamer. This is quite impractical and
scares a loth of potential players away from gaming.
Ed- Of-course. The resent demise of Dreamlands has sported a lot of rumours
of why it "died". So I would like to hear your side of the story so my
readers can get the true story once sense for all!
Piet- Yes of-course. In the beginning we where doing quite nice. But as time
went we where going minus. I can't really understand why. In my perspective
we where doing good enough. But we had some problems. We had a loth of dead
merchandise just lying there. And striped for cash we could not bye what
the customers really wanted. We remedy the problem the problem and get some
cash in to pay the bills by working there for free. But this is not practical
as a long shot. And quite quickly why had to decide to quit or go bankrupt.
Ed- What could you have done better if you decided to start all over. Could
it have worked?
Piet- Yes, there most truly is a marked for it here. I have most certainly
learned from my failures. The first thing is that we should not have started
as a part of the Dreamlands chain. We did not really get a a loth of help
from them as we should have. A loth of the dead merchandise came from them.
The state to did not support us financially, as they where supposed to. Now I
would be prepared for this. I would have planned more ahead. Probably would
have got more start capital to. I also se that it was no use hiring extra
help. As I now know more how the marked is I would not have included books
in the shops as there are to many "book specific" stores already. There
are some cardgames which we would never have got in either. I really did
not think the marked here would be so tight. There are not so many people
living here as in for example Oslo and that means more games do not have a
chance selling here as there would only one or two playing it, as apposed
to many 40 to 60 in Oslo. We also would have done a loth more marketing. We
did not really get to do a loth of marketing as we suddenly got a good deal
for housing and had to jump into business. I don't think this was fatal, but
it would have helped a loth. 
Ed- Now what happens?
Piet- We are trying to sell of most of the merchandise in the shop so that
we don't actually go broke. This would help the stockholders a loth
(including me). I am personally holding tournaments and similar events on
every second Saturday. Sundays as always holds Sylvan Pines, which I will
have more time for. And we will be holding gaming "nights" on Thursdays.
Ed- It is of-course nice the do what you like to, and making money of it at
the same time is all from swell to heaven.
Piet- That is why I started Dreamlands in the first place. The get a kick in
gaming community in Stavanger. I think all in all that Dreamlands has been a
good thing for gamers in Stavanger.
Ed- One last question before we finish. Is there any truth to the rumour that
you and 'Spanky Girl...' are homosexual partners?
Piet- No comment!!!
Wait, don't write that, write this: Of-course there is no truth to that
rumour!
'Spanky Girl...'- Damned!!!

That's all for now, I hope it has been enlightening.

Have you ever seen Hendersons and Big-foot?
Its an comedy about a classic white family in the states. One day they find a
huge animal in the forest, its not a rat or an lawyer, its a big-foot.
WOW!! Big news!! The big-foot is alive they think. Of course they don't sell
his pictures to a newspaper or a News Network, no.... they take him home too 
live with them. But what really irritates with this fagit-shit-comedy is that
the big-foot is without a penis. COME ON!!! NO PENIS?????????? WHY???????????

It will at least include a chart and maybe some reviews. And if we bother, a

@Node N "Fear!"

Since this is the special Friday the 13th edition, I thought I had to write
about this so special Friday. Friday the 13th is much more than a day when
people with strange paranoias stay at home in fear of bad luck. Yes it's
also a series of b splatters movies from originally the eighties. It stars
Jason Vorhees (the murderer) and several youngsters who are out camping or
something like that. In the end he gets returned to the sea where his grave
is or burnt or other equally hurting things. Although in the first part of
this series of movies it is actually the mother of Jason who murders people
and there is nothing supernatural about it. It's just a normal thriller. The
last part is truly the worst. The part before this part (th) is supposed to
be the last part, but some other people decided to fuck up things and make
just one more Jason movie and spoil everything. One thing that almost is
interesting about the Jason movies is the continuity. They have gone to a
great deal of work to make sure that Jason gets another scratch in almost
each of the movies. Most notably being the cut in his ice-hockey mask (yes
all psychos has to have one) made by an axe.

In 1994 (a long time ago) me and Mausoleum decided to start making "Friday
the 13th" anims as a tribute to Jason. These anims where short anims staring
a character similar to Jason who in some kind of way kills an apposing
character. We made 7 whole edition and one special. Sadly many of the anims
got lost in virus corruption. The number 7 edition was a blast if we could
only find that bastard who has a copy of it. As a special treat I have
