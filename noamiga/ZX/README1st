ZX SPECTRUM ENCYCLOPEDIA
------------------------

VOLUME 1 © D.NOYCE NOVEMBER 1996
---------------------------------

This is a disk mag for the ZX Spectrum side of things.  Interesting, I
hope, for those that still have an interest in the good ole Speccy.

It was created using F1 Licenceware's  DMC.  I originally started the
project in June using the PD program Magnum but after purchasing the 
F1 CD Rom decided that DMC was a better program.  I hope to release 
this mag as regularly as possible, but this depends on the feedback 
that I receive.  Please write and let me know what you think of it. 
If I receive a lot of letters then it is obvious that the magazine 
has been appreciated as has my hard work.  Future issues will be 
available from me at £1.50 including postage.  The address can be 
found within the magazine.

I can also supply PD Software at competetive prices, including a pick and 
mix selection of approx 3,000 Speccy snapshots.  For details just send a 
blank disk and SAE to:-
