»- November 28, 2001 - For Immediate Release -

Cloanto released today version 5.0 of Amiga Forever, the official Amiga
emulation and connectivity package for PCs. New features include
just-in-time (JIT) compiler technology to dramatically increase
execution speed, new ROM and operating system files to emulate not only
the Amiga computers but also Commodore's CDTV and CD³² game consoles,
and Software Manager, a content delivery and management system for
one-click news, updates and downloads. An experimental version of the
revolutionary Disk2FDI software, which makes it possible to read Amiga
floppy disks on the PC, is provided for the technically inclined. Other
improvements include support for new Windows XP and DirectX features and
new Picasso96 technology to better map Amiga graphics calls to low-level
DirectX functionality and native x86 code, in order to achieve maximum
performance without sacrificing compatibility. Cloanto publicly
benchmarked the new version of the emulation software to be 30 times
faster than the previous version (which already matched the CPU
performance of the fastest Amiga 68060 silicon). Amiga Forever can be
installed or run from CD-ROM (no installation or reboot required), and
is also available in a downloadable Online Edition. In either case,
Amiga application can run side by side with the host operating system
and its applications, while taking advantage of features such as virtual
memory, advanced power management, digital rights management, NTFS
filing system, wireless networking, and thousands of past, present and
future drivers for peripherals, specifications and gadgets which the
Amiga would otherwise not be able to support. For additional information
please refer to the Amiga Forever home page at amigaforever.info.
