3. Ank&uuml;ndigung: »Betatester II«-Programm und -Konferenz [englisch]

Thendic-France (http://www.thendic-france.com) informiert:

»The Betatester Program has been very successful and we need to acknowledge 
the reliable support we have received from most of our Betatesters for the 
Pegasos and MorphOS. Thanks! 

Of course, we also have to thank the Core MorphOS Development Team who in 
some cases for years have worked diligently to push MorphOS to a state 
suitable for commercial release. 

We have decided that the best way to say thank you and the best way to get 
"back to the future" as fast as possible is to bring everyone to one place. 
So we are going to do that! 

If you are a Core MorphOS Developer, a Qualified Betatester, or a Phase II 
Betatester (to be explained) we will organize and cover your travel and 
lodging expenses to the Betatester II Conference in Frankfurt, Germany. The 
Conference is currently scheduled for 12 October. We understand that we 
need to push the date back so that plans can be made and we can maximize 
the opportunity to make this gathering as meaningful and productive as 
possible. The new date will be 14-15 December at the Hilton Hotel, 
Frankfurt. 

Get ready! M-Day is here! 

1. On 12 October version 1.0 of MorphOS will be released to all 
Betatesters. 
2. The week of 13 October the Pegasos Betatester mainboard will be released 
to Resellers. It is STILL a "Betatester." 
3. On 12 October Phase II of Team Betatester will begin.


About the Betatester II Conference 

If you are Core MorphOS Developer you are automatically included. 

If you are a "qualified" Betatester (you have been sending your bug 
reports, testing applications, etc.) you are included. 

If you purchase a Betatester in October and port an application or develop 
an original program for MorphOS to demonstrate at Betatester II you are 
*eligible* to be included. 

If you have an interesting hardware development or special hardware skills 
required to test and experiment with the Pegasos you are *eligible* for 
Phase II of the Betatester Program and can be included. 

If you are a Graphic Artist, a Demo Scene producer, or a Web Designer and 
you have something to show us that captures the spirit of the future we 
want to create with Team Betatester, you are *eligible* and can be 
included. The websites to be created are www.pegasosppc.com and 
www.pegasosppc.org. 

We will provide travel and lodging for up to 100 Developers/Betatesters. To

Also at Betatester II... 

We will present the strategic plan for MorphOS, the Pegasos and the 
eclipsis. 

We will present the first peripheral devices: a wireless camera, a smart 
card reader, and the DataPlay disc drive. They will all work with the 
Pegasos and depending on what activity each Betatester is involved with in 
the future these devices will be given to Betatesters for 
testing/development. All Betatesters will receive the Thendic card reader 
and a Betatester Smart Card that enables secure FTP access to the 
Betatester II application library and loyalty program. 

We will also award 1000 Euros for the best program ported to MorphOS, the 
best Demo, and the best hardware innovation presented at the Conference. 
The results will be determined by a popular vote of the 100 
Developers/Betatesters present and the Thendic/bplan Team. Each person has 
one vote. 

The Conference begins at 1000 14 December. The formal presentations begin 
at 1500 and end at 1800. From 1000 to 1800 only Developers/Betatesters and 
the Thendic/bplan Team will be admitted. At 1800 until 2400 the Conference 
will be open to all interested parties and a buffet style "working" dinner 
will be provided with coffee and drinks. All others admitted for the 
evening demonstration from will receive a Betatester II T-Shirt. The cost 
of entry for interested parties is 20 Euros. However, anyone having 
purchased a Betatester and not already a Conference participant will be 
admitted free. 

Sunday, 15 December the Conference will be open from 1000 until 1500. The 
voting for the contests will be at 1200. The cost of entry for interested
