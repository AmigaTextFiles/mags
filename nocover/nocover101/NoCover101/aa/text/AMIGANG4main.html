»Mai Logic Incorporated And Eyetech Group Limited Partner to Capture New 
Amiga Territory

FREMONT, CA. July 9, 2002. Mai Logic Incorporated, a technology design 
house of integrated circuits/systems, today announced an agreement with 
Eyetech Group Ltd. to distribute the Teron CX and PX development systems in 
Europe, and to distribute production systems based on the Teron CX and PX 
designs to the Amiga market worldwide. Terms of the agreement emphasized 
both companies' long-term commitment to foster an unshakeable partnership 
and to create a bright future for the Amiga customers and partners.

Eyetech in the Amiga Market
Since it was first conceived in 1985, the same vision that made the Amiga 
famous for multimedia development and delivery in studios, cable stations 
and with system developers and users, still gives the Amiga brand a high 
profile amongst multimedia developers and carries with it a highly skilled, 
vociferous and loyal user base. Thanks to a vast community of developers 
dedicated to using and updating Amiga's small footprint, high performance 
operating system, coupled with the advanced PPC technology enabled by MAI's 
Articia chipset series, the Amiga is once more perfectly positioned to 
become the most cost-effective delivery platform for 3D and graphic 
applications for the current decade and beyond.

"Eyetech has established itself as one of the leading providers of Amiga 
hardware and software Worldwide," said Alan M. Redhouse, Managing Director 
of Eyetech Group. "The high efficiency and mature, designed-in, 
multitasking capabilities of the Amiga OS means the new AmigaOne based on 
the Teron CX/PX's hardware architecture will deliver new levels of user 
responsiveness far greater than that of equivalently priced Wintel or 
Macintosh computers."

"We view the partnership with Mai Logic as an excellent example of a win-
win relationship whereby both parties can combine their individual areas of 
expertise and collectively create a better product with optimal 
performance," added Alan.

Mai Logic's Platform Capabilities
Teron is the first and the only system that offers AGP support to Power PC 
processors. Its outstanding multimedia features make it a complete, turnkey 
package for gaming, presentation, and the entertainment industry as a 
whole.

The advanced Teron PX comes with a 300-pin MegArray connector, which 
provides extremely easy configuration to a range of development platforms 
driven by single- or dual- PowerPC microprocessor cards. Jason Hou, CEO of 
Mai Logic stated, "We are pulling together our high performance Teron PX 
with Eyetech Group's renowned technology in hardware and software solutions 
focused on the Amiga." 

Mai Logic strengthens the ideal environment provided by Teron for system 
development by working with its software partners such as GDA Technologies, 
Inc. on Boot code development, ITC Infotech (USA), Inc. on Windows drivers 
design, and DATEC Software Solutions on multiple OS. This combination of 
technologies will allow developers to push the envelop in adding to Amiga's 
repertoire and advancing an operating system that once was years ahead of 
its competition. "With the vertical total system technologies in place, Mai 
Logic is in a position to undertake and execute complex turnkey development 
in the areas of ASIC, Board, Firmware, Real-Time Embedded systems and 
Systems applications," said Jason.
