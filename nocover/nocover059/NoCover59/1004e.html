<P>FULL VERSION</P>
<P>
 This racing game has only one goal:
 To survive the given time!
 There are no rules and everybody has to fight everybody else.
 A big help during the 8 levels is the built in rocket launcher of
 your car. But bewmare - some of your opponents are equipped with single or triple rocket launchers, too.
 Fortunately the computer's cars can be destroyed by a single hit with your weapon.
