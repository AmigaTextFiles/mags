AMIGA International, Inc. / AMIGA, Inc.
---------------------------------------

1. Geheimnis um Hersteller des 'MMC' offenbar gel&uuml;ftet

Das R&auml;tsel um den Hersteller des in Amiga-Kreisen 'MMC' genannten
Mediaprozessors, der in der n&auml;chsten Amiga-Generation verwendet werden
soll, scheint gel&ouml;st: Unter Berufung auf Amiga International hat ein User
in einem &ouml;ffentlichen Amiga-Forum gemeldet, dass die Firma k&uuml;rzlich von
dem kanadischen Grafikhardware-Hersteller ATI aufgekauft worden sei.
Unter der Voraussetzung, dass dies der Wahrheit entspricht, kann es sich
bei dem Hersteller des 'MMC' wohl nur um die Firma Chromatic Research
(<a href="http://www.chromatic.com">http://www.chromatic.com</a>) handeln, die ATI im November erworben hatte.
Bereits vor Monaten war Chromatic Research in Ger&uuml;chten als m&ouml;glicher
Hersteller des 'MMC' genannt worden. N&auml;here Informationen zu dessen 
Mediaprozessor MPact sind auf <a href="http://www.mpact.com">http://www.mpact.com</a> verf&uuml;gbar.
Nicht ganz klar ist, ob Amiga, Inc. auch nach dem Aufkauf von ATI auf die
Technologie von Chromatic Research setzen wird. Zumindest wird man sich 
wohl nicht starr darauf festlegen, sondern das neue Amiga-Betriebssystem 
m&ouml;glichst Hardware-unabh&auml;ngig entwickeln.

Hier drei Presseerkl&auml;rungen zum Aufkauf von Chromatic Research durch ATI:

proceed. Further terms will be announced if an agreement is reached.

future products of Chromatic, equal to more than 300 man-years of both

property including a significant patent portfolio relating to over 100
inventions and fixed assets. Chromatic currently employs approximately 140
