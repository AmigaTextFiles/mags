5. Cloanto nimmt Stellung zur AMIGA-Zukunft

In einer Stellungnahme erl&auml;uterte Cloanto, der Hersteller von Personal 
Paint, k&uuml;rzlich die zuk&uuml;nftige Produktpolitik. Das Unternehmen wird wegen 
der unklaren Rolle des PowerPC in der AMIGA-Zukunft vorerst weiter auf die 
68k-Schiene setzen. Allerdings will man die n&auml;chste Version von Personal 
Paint so programmieren, dass eine einfache Portierbarkeit auf einen neuen 
AMIGA (wie der auch immer konkret aussehen wird) gew&auml;hrleistet ist.

Hier die gesamte Stellungnahme im Original, anschlie&szlig;end folgt ein kurzes 
Fazit:

&raquo;From time to time we become aware, through direct user emails and 
newsgroup posts, of some questions related to our Amiga products and 
projects. We always answer directly to all inquiries, but we would also 
like to publicly try to answer and clarify some of the more popular issues.

No doubt, a frequent question is about our plans with respect to PowerPC 
Amiga expansion boards. Last year, when we released a PowerPC version of 
the Personal Paint blitting library, we were very proud to be among the 
first to release some PowerPC code for the Amiga. Since then, we did not 
port entire packages to the PowerPC. This is because porting a complex 
program like Personal Paint, for example, is not just a matter of simply 
&quot;recompiling&quot; it, or at least it is not with the development tools and the 
PowerPC libraries available so far. We still plan to do this for Personal 
Paint 8, which is designed with more code portability in mind, if the 
PowerPC will be accepted and endorsed as an official Amiga platform, or if 
tools emerge that make it possible to port Personal Paint to a PowerPC 
system by using the same code as for the 68K version. In this latter case, 
we might even port Personal Paint 7.x.

Another issue is that the original Personal Paint PowerPC blitting library
released last year does not work with newer PowerPC expansion systems. This
blitting library was tested both by Cloanto and by the manufacturers of the
boards (who were aware of our release plans), and originally worked 
flawlessly.
After the release of the library on the Personal Paint 7.1 CD-ROM, the 
PowerPC expansion systems were changed in a way that created 
incompatibilities with existing PowerPC software, such as this library. We 
changed the code twice, and released it on Aminet, in the biz/cloan 
directory, and we also shared our source code with the developers of the 
expansion systems, but given the continued and repeated incompatibilities, 
we now feel that the maintenance overhead does not justify the performance 
improvement, and, as explained, we are looking at the whole matter from a 
broader perspective. To completely solve this issue, we recommend to use 
the standard 68K blitting libraries, which are used by default by the 
program. In our tests with Amiga systems having both a PowerPC and a 68060 
CPU, the 68060 blitting library was only 10% slower than the PowerPC 
library. It is to be expected that PowerPC Amiga systems will only be able 
to express their full potential when the complete Amiga OS and all new 
software are entirely compiled for the PowerPC. Before this occurs, and 
unless it can be verified that at least some software which can justify the 
overall investment is available for the PowerPC and runs considerably 
faster than on a real or emulated 68K Amiga, we recommend to use 68K Amiga 
systems such as the 68060, or emulation.

It is no secret that, while the power of the CPUs used in PCs doubles about
every 18 months, we became aware of the fact that an Amiga can now be 
emulated quite well by other systems. In some cases, which can only 
increase rapidly over time, emulated Amiga systems are already cheaper 
and/or faster than silicon ones. Whatever the official Amiga of the future 
will be, whether it will be based on a PowerPC, or on a different (non-68K) 
CPU, it will need emulation to run the current Amiga OS and applications 
(which have now officially been defined as &quot;Classic Amiga&quot;). We plan to 
continue supporting Amiga emulation and other means of integrating the 
Classic Amiga with different platforms, as we have successfully done with 
the Amiga Forever package. We will also continue to invest in the Amiga, 
preferably by focussing on development on one official platform, rather 
than politics related to the use of one CPU or the other. In any case, we 
plan to release new Amiga products before next Christmas.

These are hard times for commercial Amiga software developers: sales are 
low, and the uncertainty about the future has never been as high as it is 
now, since we don't even know what the new Amiga OS we have to write 
software for will look like. We hope that we had a chance to clarify some 
doubts about our own future, and we thank all users for their patience and 
continued support. It appears that it is now our turn to be patient and 
wait to see what the future will bring.

Amiga Emulation: Good or Bad for the Amiga?

Fazit:

Frage: Was unterscheidet eine gute von einer sehr guten Softwarefirma? 
Antwort: Die gute stellt qualitativ hochwertige Programme her - die sehr 
gute k&uuml;mmert sich zus&auml;tzlich um die Anwender.

Und das tut Cloanto beispielhaft. Erst vor wenigen Wochen hat das 
Unternehmen quasi als &quot;Sommergeschenk&quot; Personal Paint 6.4 als Freeware im 
Aminet ver&ouml;ffentlicht. Einfach so.
Nun erl&auml;utert Cloanto seine Zukunftspl&auml;ne - allein schon das ist nicht 
selbstverst&auml;ndlich - und nimmt dabei kein Blatt vor den Mund. In einem Satz 
formuliert, dr&uuml;ckt die Stellungnahme etwa Folgendes aus: &quot;Das Gesch&auml;ft 
l&auml;uft mies, der zuk&uuml;nftige AMIGA-Weg ist unklar, aber wir stehen weiterhin 
zu euch&quot;. 
An diesem Verhalten sollte sich manch anderes Unternehmen ein Beispiel 
nehmen.
