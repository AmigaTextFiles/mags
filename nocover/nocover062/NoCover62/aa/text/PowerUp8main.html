8. Nova Design k&uuml;ndigt PowerPC-Effekte f&uuml;r ImageFX an

»Nova Design, Inc., producers of the award winning and best selling ImageFX
package are proud to announce the impending release of the first package
of PowerPC modules for ImageFX.

Code named PowerStation, volume 1 is a package of ImageFX modules designed
to work with the PowerPC as a coprocessor. This speeds up the specific
modules up to ten times the speed of the same module running on a native
68060 processor. In many cases the effects become nearly real-time!

PowerStation premiered to record crowds at the Amiga '99 show in St. Louis
and became the 'must-have' item of the show!

PowerStation Specifics

The PowerPC effects are for use with ImageFX 3.2 or higher only. This first
volume of modules includes the following effects, which have all received
the PowerPC treatment. You might also find a few other extras included
with this PowerPC package as well!

Bubble - creates multiple bubbles over your selected image. You can control
the animation and optional color of the bubbles easily. Create an undersea
effect or psychedelic champagne bubbles!

Fire - one of ImageFX's most popular effects. Fire can create flickering
candle flames, gas-stove flames, raging forest fires and more. All
parameters can be animated or controlled through a single slider.

Clouds - recently added to ImageFX, the Clouds effect can create amazing
multi-layered fractal clouds. It can also be used to create fog or smoke
over images, simulated explosions, or even seamless textures of landscapes
with cloud patterns animating across them.

Liquid - this is an endlessly fascinating effect that distorts your image
as if it were on water. You can create funhouse mirror distortions or
unique video transitions with this effect.

FXForge - based on the same formulas used in Adobe Photoshop's Filter
FactoryTM package, FXForge can create an infinite number of custom special
effects using mathematical formulas. Color effects, distorting effects,
lighting effects are all possible with this amazing engine. It remains
fully compatible with the thousands of effects available on the Internet
for Adobe's Filter FactoryTM.
