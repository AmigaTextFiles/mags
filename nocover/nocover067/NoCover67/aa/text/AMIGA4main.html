4. AMIGA sucht Mitarbeiter f&uuml;r Java-/Sicherheitstechnologien

Mit dem folgenden Posting, das in drei Nicht-Amiga-Newsgroups 
ver&ouml;ffentlicht wurde, ist zum ersten Mal Blake Ward als 'Director of 
Distributed Computing' bei AMIGA in Erscheinung getreten.

»At Amiga we are designing next generation Internet-ready, consumer-
oriented digital appliances. The Amiga name is associated the world over 
with user-friendly, low-cost, powerful computing. We are taking this 
philosophy into the next generation, enabling products from hand-held 
Internet appliances to high-end graphics computers that help the user 
rather than frustrate them. You can visit the general Amiga web site
(http://www.amiga.com/) for more details on Amiga, our history and the
community (it's worth noting that the web site is fairly heavily oriented
toward classic Amiga products, and therefore isn't completely
representative of our new direction which will focus strongly on digital
appliances).

We are looking for senior engineering candidates who have a proven industry
track record of developing and delivering robust, top-quality software and
hardware on time. At Amiga we believe strongly in both teamwork and
individual contribution, and all staff members are expected to drive their
commitments to completion. We expect all candidates to be entrepreneurial,
focused and fast moving. We are hiring only the best.

Our operating environment for digital information appliances will be based
heavily on distributed computing - objects and data that will move freely
between devices and over the Internet. As such, security is extremely
important and our goal is to build it into our architecture at every level.
We're looking for one or more candidates with general security experience,
and specifically experience dealing with the issues surrounding security in
Java and Internet-based applications. Some relevant areas of expertise
might include: signed code (e.g. applets, JavaBeans), authentication,
encryption , SSL, PKI, general Linux security, Java SecurityManagers &
general Java VM security issues, etc. Experience with e-commerce security
issues, digital wallets, enterprise javabeans, etc. would also be relevant.

The positions are available immediately and are located in San Jose, CA. If
interested, you can submit your resume by fax, mail or email to:

Amiga
1740 Technology Drive, Suite 180
San Jose, CA 95110
Fax: 408-441-9152
