1. ComputerCity plant A4000-basierenden Computer

Der niederl&auml;ndische Amiga-H&auml;ndler ComputerCity hat mit dem Amiga E4000 
einen Computer auf Basis des A4000-Mainboards angek&uuml;ndigt:

»Amiga E4000

First of all, this machine is not a new development, new mainboard, or
anything like that. The E4000 consists of a standard Amiga 4000 mainboard
(NEW) built in a ELBOX Ebox tower (also known as Power Tower or Winner
Tower). The processor board is manufactured by Apollo. We supply AmigaOS
3.5 with this machine. If you buy an E4000 before OS 3.5 is out, it will
be sent to you free of charge when it has been released. As the E4000 is
based on the Amiga 4000 mainboard it has of course a CPU slot for PPC
expansions.

Supplied only while stocks last. All components are available in virtually
unlimited capacity except for the A4000 mainboards. When these run out the
supply of E4000's will end (obviously).

Shipment of the E4000 will start in about 2 weeks. Pre-orders are being
accepted as of today.

   o Midi-Tower with 230 Watt power supply
   o 68040 (40 MHz.) or 68060 (50 MHz.) CPU (full versions)
   o 2 MB Chipmemory (on A4000 mainboard)
   o 32 MB Fastmemory (on processor board) maximum 128 MB
