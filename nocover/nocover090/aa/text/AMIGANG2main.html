»e.p.i.c. signs up to produce AmigaDE content

Snoqualmie, WA - August 6, 2001

e.p.i.c. interactive entertainment, a well-known name in the Amiga gaming
community, today signed on to create additional games for the AmigaDE.
These games will initially target PDA's and handheld devices such as the
Sharp Zaurus.

e.p.i.c. has been active in the Amiga gaming market since 1996. Some of
their titles include "sixth sense investigations" (1998) and "virtual gp"
(1999). One of their biggest hits on the Amiga platform was "foundation
directors cut" (1999). Apart from their own titles, e.pi.c. also creates
ports of titles on other platforms such as the classic adventure game
"simon the sorcerer II" and the realtime strategy hit "earth 2140".

The first three titles that e.p.i.c. will create for the AmigaDE are
"Boxikon", "Piles O' Tiles", and "Pegger". All three are puzzle games with
superb graphics and presentation layout. In its upcoming releases, e.p.i.c.
will create other kinds of games such as card games, action shooters,
puzzlers and sport games.

"The Amiga in its classic form was a dream come true for developers and
users alike", said Thomas Steiding, General Manager and one of the founders
of e.p.i.c. "Most of our employees started their careers with Amiga and
remain diehard fans. We look forward to creating the same kind of
excitement on the PDA platform."

"e.p.i.c. has been an excellent partner and has created some premier
content for Amiga" said Bill McEwen, President and CEO of Amiga, Inc. "We
look forward to their active participation as they translate their gaming
expertise from the desktop to the handheld market."

The market for video games in the United States, which includes arcade, PC,
console, and online gaming, is currently estimated to be worth $11 billion.
The AmigaDE platform allows developers to create game applications that
target this market. The binary portable nature of AmigaDE content allows
applications to migrate seamlessly from cell phones and handheld devices to
set-top boxes and up to desktop machines and servers.
