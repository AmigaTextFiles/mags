<h4><center>Willkommen zum zweiten Teil der Metal-Lyrics.
Dieses mal dreht sich alles um Ayreon, dem Geheimtipp schlechthin für
Freunde progressiver Klänge. Genauer gesagt geht es um die beiden
Konzeptalben der Universal Migrator-Geschichte, deren Story von
unterschiedlichsten Gastmusikern in Szene gesetzt wurde. Beide CD`s
("The Dream Sequencer" und "Flight Of The Migrator") sind zwar einzeln
erhältlich, aber die Geschichte ist übergreifend, weswegen man sich
gleich beide Werke zulegen sollte um in den musikalischen Hochgenuss
kommen zu können. Teil eins, "The Dream Sequencer", kann beim besten willen
nicht als Metal bezeichnet werden, sondern eher als Rock,
der mit zahlreichen Effekten und psychedelischen momenten aufwarten
kann. Nicht leicht zu verdauen - hat man sich aber erst mal richtig
"reingearbeitet" eröffnet diese CD ganze Dimensionen !
Beim zweiten und abschliessenden Teil, "Flight Of The Migrator", wird dann
die Schwermetallische Schiene befahren. Aber auch hier bestimmt der
progressive Ton und die psychedelischen Effekte das Geschehen. Kurzum:
keine leichte Hausmannskost die einem hier geboten wird, und die sich
wohl kaum als dahin plätschernde Hintergrundmusik eignet, sondern
sich nur mit voller Aufmerksamkeit richtig entfalten kann. Wer anspruch in
der Musik sucht ist bei beiden Alben also an der richtigen Adresse ! Und
obendrein gibt es noch eine interessante Story, die zwar straight ist,
aber dennoch genug Interpretationsmöglichkeiten zulässt - und diese
könnt ihr an dieser Stelle nachlesen. Das von mir Grau-kursierte ist aber
nicht Teil der eigentlichen Musik, sondern spannt die Geschichte im
Booklet weiter ! Die Computerstimme dagegen taucht innerhalb der
musikalischen Komponente auf ; die habe ich ebenfalls
hier nieder geschrieben. Hmpf - Ich hoffe das ganze ist nicht zu konfus
geraten und noch einigermassen übersichtlich ;-) ! Wie auch immer: Wem`s gefällt
der sollte nicht
zögern und sich diese Silberscheiben zulegen ! In Verbindung mit der
stimmungsvollen Mucke ist die Geschichte dreimal so gut :-) !<p>Heavy Greets,<p>

 Hold On This Moment In Time,
 Savor Of Life How It Used To Be !
 Hold On To The World In Its Prime,
 Breathe In The Air, Feel The Energy !
