11. PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX k&uuml;ndigt SuperView NG v7.70 und Mailingliste an

&raquo;23.06.1998  
       PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX Announces SuperView Update and Continued Support


 In another step concerning the demonstration of planned further support of  
 the &quot;Classic Amiga&quot; platform, including powerUP (TM), PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX  
 today announced the upcoming release of SuperView NG 7.70, which will      
 include at least SuperView-Library 21.3. [ Scheduled for: 30 June 1998 ]

 Every user of SuperView-Library based programs, like e.g. SuperView NG
 itself, the ArtEffect AE SuperView plugin or Picture Manager professional  
 (PMPro) as well as ImageEngineer users may wish to at least upgrade the    
 SuperView-Library to a newer version - the full library release is part of  


 Registration only is required for SuperView &amp; Tools itself - thus people   
 who maybe had problems with e.g. the library shipped with the free PMPro   
 demo from Aminet or with other semi or fully commercially distributed      
 versions, may wish to install the new version over the old one as well.

 A number of bugs have been fixed, as well as new features have been        
 introduced.
 For example, there now will be the long-expected Window.svdriver plus a    
 separate &quot;WinSlide&quot; tool (the latter as part of SuperView) that finally    
 will allow to replace any remaining 3rd party tools for displaying         
 graphics in a window on public screens...

 Together with the PPC speedup modules that are available separately
 for SuperView-Library, new speed dimensions are to be encountered by
 owners of powerUP (TM) boards - the number of PPC modules already
 reached a count of (currently) 52 separate modules, including impressively
 fast ppc-native loaders/savers for e.g. JPEG, PNG and TIFF. (*)

 Here's a small overview of the programs features:

   - only requires OS V2.04 and 68000
   - utilizes OS V2.1 and V3.x features and 680x0 specific module versions,
     as well as optional powerUP (TM) powerPC module plugins (*)
   - localized and font-sensitive
   - ARexx support, AmigaGuide help and Commodity functionality
   - integrated graphics viewer, converter, editor and screen-grabber
     with basic image processing capabilities
   - many separate tools, including SuperSlide, CyberSlide, WinSlide,
     SuperViewPalette and SVPrefs

       (*) PPC modules currently based on ppc.library V45
