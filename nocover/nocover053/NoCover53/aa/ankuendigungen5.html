DESCRIPTION

     An editor for use with the Formula One Grand Prix or World Circuit
     game (published by MicroProse Software).  It is very easy to use,
     with a standard 2.0 look graphical user interface (even on KS 1.x!)
     and on-line help should you need it.

     Allows you to alter most of the in-game setup, including computer
     car performance, car/helmet/pitcrew colours, car fragility and many
     other things (and I MEAN many!).  Sound samples can also be replaced,
     cockpit graphics changed, and lap records and setups printed.

     Changes can be saved directly to a copy of the game which is running
     in memory, or to the main file used by the game for a more permanent
     change.

     Also incorporated in the main program are a number of memory patches,
     including Toni Wilen's GPPatch and Grant Reeve's PatchF1GP.

     F1GP-Ed breathes new life into an ageing, but excellent game.  1994,
     1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 sample datafiles supplied for those who
     don't want to mess about with all the options.

     The program itself is auto-enhancing, which means that it will run
     on a basic A500 with KS 1.2, but will make use of KS 2.x or KS 3.x
     specific routines on suitable machines to make itself even better.

     Supported languages:

     English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Danish, Swedish,
     Finnish, Norwegian, Czech, Greek and Polish.

NEW FEATURES

   o f1gp.library v36 - major update, including new game patches:
     - The game will now work with non-15kHz AGA screenmodes including
       DblPAL, DblNTSC and Multiscan (i.e. not PAL or NTSC)
     - Patched the game to utilize the faster fetch modes of the AGA
       chipset, making the game slightly faster/smoother on an A1200 or
       A4000
   o Major change to the &quot;Less cars in races&quot; memory patch.  This
     option has been removed.  It is replaced by a patch that is always
     saved to the F1GP binary or memory, which means you can save less
     than 26 to the game without having to worry about installing the
     patch.  Of course, the patch will now work even if F1GP-Ed is not
     running
   o The game will now attempt to load f1gp.library and patch itself
     when you run it - this means that the VBR problem, for example,
     will disappear for good!  No longer will you have to run F1GP-Ed
     in the background to enable the 'use VBR' patch!  Only takes effect
     once you have saved to the F1GP binary with this new version
   o Moved wet weather options out of the preferences into a new
     seperate wet weather window, joined by a new option which changes
     the way wet weather is determined during a championship season
   o Added option to disable the unnecessary requestors that show up in
     the game after loading or saving a file successfully
   o Added two more symbols to the GPPatch HUD which tell you that a car
     will be pitting this lap (differentiates between damage and tyre
     stops)
   o Due to popular demand, it is now possible to preset the turbo keys
   o Automatically fixes a problem with the game's file requester,
     removing the limit of only displaying a maximum of 64 entries
   o Viewer screens for the backdrops and cockpit designs are now opened
     using the most appropriate screenmode, instead of defaulting to
     PAL/NTSC
   o Altered the HUD to use AGA specific features, where appropriate,
     which should stop it slowing F1GP down as much (uses less DMA)
   o Lots of the usual bug-fixes

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
