14. Neue Video-Software im Anmarsch: VideoFX

&raquo;VideoFX

An instant start for the Professional VideoProduction with Amiga

Makes it easy to integrate your Video productions with effects, slides and
audio samples. Even more this CD includes the best of the ClassX !

The name &quot;VideoFX&quot; suggests that this program is meant for videos and video
effects. But VideoFX is far more than this. In the beginning our aim was to
create a program that could offer users a more flexible and automatic 
system to create videos. We wanted a program able to play animations and 
show images in an only environment. In other words, we wanted to create a 
program easy to be used.
We wanted our program to be able to launch animations simply by pressing a 
key.

These ideas would have created a very useful program since it would have 
allowed the user to set up videos without getting mad with two or three 
animation players, stop/still operations on the video recorders, etc...

Then, step by step we have increased considerably the functions of our 
program.
Thanks to Amiga's hardware and software systems, particularly suitable for
videos, VideoFX allows obtaining much more than animation players. As a 
matter of fact, any Amiga machine is equipped with four audio-stereo 
channels and can execute more than one program at the same time, by 
integrating them by means of AREXX.

The fruit of our ideas and hard work is VideoFX: a program that allows
controlling and managing video productions automatically and in a 
integrated way. Besides, VideoFX's potentialities are not restricted to 
video productions.
VideoFX can be used for many more purposes, which you will understand after
reading this manual.

The concept of VideoFX

VideoFX is based on the simple concept of event-&#062;effect. The event is 
something that happens; the effect is what happens (what is performed by 
the machine) as a consequence of the event. To give an example: if you 
press the light button (event) the light will go on (effect). The 
management of VideoFX's events and effects is very complete and allows 
creating complex associations between events and effects: an event may 
cause several effects, and an effect may be caused by several events. Going 
on with the example of the light switch, we can say that it is possible to 
create a lighting system with two light switches and three bulbs, so that 
the first switch switches on all the three bulbs, while the second one 
switches on only one bulb.

Technical Features

VideoFX is compatible with AmigaOS 2.1. (KickStart v37.175+, Workbench 
v38.xx) or the following ones. It requires at least 2Mb of Fast Ram and a 
Hard Disk.
Obviously, the more memory, fast processors and AGA chipsets are used the 
better will be the resuls obtained from VideoFX. As most programs for 
Amiga, VideoFX does not require any particular processor. VideoFX can be 
used with AmigaOS 2.1 developed in 1991.

Note that Amiga allows his users to choose the configuration more suitable 
to his requirements in spite of the actual international trend to create 
products to induce users to buy other products.

The events manageable by VideoFX:

 * Pressing a key on the keyboard;
 * Pressing the left mouse button;
 * Pressing the right mouse button;
 * Expiring of a timer.

The effects:

 * Viewing an image (IFF-ILBM);
 * Playing an animation (IFF-ANIM5/7);
 * Playing an animation (XFA);
 * Playing an audio sample (IFF-8SVX);
 * Executing a VFX effect (user's audio/video format)
 * Executing an external command;
 * Controlling the status of the Timers;
 * Executing an external AREXX script.

The formats HAM-6 (4096 colours) and HAM-8 (16 million colours) are 
supported for all the visual effects. VideoFX supports the custom VFX 
format to create effects with synchronized audio and video.
The current version of VideoFX supports up to 500 events and can record up 
to 1000 events. The Image, Animation, and VFX effects are automatically 
centred on the screen, according to the overscan settings of the machine.
