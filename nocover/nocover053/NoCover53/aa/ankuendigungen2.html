DESCRIPTION

    UltraAccounts is one of the leading home accounts packages for
    the Amiga, with a powerful but easy-to-use user interface that has
    been specially designed to be suitable for beginners as well as
    experts. It contains all the features you need, and none you don't
    need - and is all presented from a GUI which is so easy to set up
    and use that even people with no experience of computers or
    accounts will be able to get it up and running in no time.

    Features include:

    - Supplied in 8 languages: English, Frangais, Deutsch, Nederlands,
      Italiano, Polski, Svenska, Magyar.

    - Easy-to-use user interface. All windows are font sensitive and
      fully resizable, and all windows are multithreaded (you can open
      and use several windows at the same time).

    - Supports up to 50 seperate accounts, each with its own opening
      balance and minimum &amp; maximum amounts. Money can be easily
      transferred from one account to another.

    - Create up to 50 transaction tags, for grouping your transactions
      into categories. Each tag can have its own budget settings.

    - Full payslip support, including multiple wage configurations.
      Find out how much tax has been deducted from your wages at the
      touch of a button!

    - Standing orders and timed transfers are automatically entered
      into your accounts for you. Supports debit &amp; credit standing
      orders, together with optional end dates for all timed events.
      Transactions entered from these timed events can be edited or
      erased *without* duplicate entries being created.

    - Easily pre-define the details of commonly-used transactions and
      transfers, such as doing the shopping or paying the gas bill.
      You no longer have to keep retyping all the details whenever you
      enter one of these transactions.

    - Basic share handling facilities.

    - Full graph facilities. Produce pie, bar or line graphs, with
      optional future projections. Very useful for seeing trends, or
      looking for odd peaks of income/expenditure.

    - Reminders. Make sure you don't miss important events, such as
      birthdays/anniversaries or bills that need paying.

    - Full printout facilities. Accounts &amp; transactions lists can be
      easily printed, or saved as an ASCII file. Graphs can also be
      printed.

    - Flexible search facilities, to help you find those elusive
      transactions!

    - Check VAT registration codes (UK only), to make sure that the
      people charging you VAT are genuinely registered to charge it.

    - All data files are encrypted and optionally password protected,
      to protect your data.

    - Fully configurable export formats.

      removing the decimal places. Useful for countries like Italy.

    - Now includes Swedish and Hungarion translations. Also includes
      a full German translation of the AmigaGuide docs.
