12. Neue 68k- und PPC-Clients f&uuml;r die RSA-Wettbewerbe verf&uuml;gbar

&raquo;PRESS RELEASE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 1st 1998

Continuing the Amiga future with DES II-2 and new clients

The Amiga RC5 Team effort is proud to announce new and improved PowerPC 
clients (as well as 68k) for the ongoing RSA Secret Key challenges, 
participating in the Distributed Net/Bovine RC5-64 and the upcoming DES II-
2 contests.

With the announcement of the roadmap to the next generation Amiga by Amiga 
Inc. we feel the Amiga has a clear future, destined to be at the forefront 
of alternative, perhaps even mainstream computing again. With this 
knowledge in hand our effort focuses on exposure for the Amiga and it's 
user community by competing at the very top of abovementioned challenges, 
currently ranked seventh out of thousands of competing teams, amongst 
others in hot pursuit of the Win32/Windows team.

Again many thanks must go to Stefan 'Blast' Smietanowski for the 
programming efforts spent to improve the clients, Steve Krueger for 
compiler help and many others, amongst which of course those already 
contributing CPU power.

We ask all of you who own an Amiga or support the Amiga in spirit to join 
us now for the DES II-2 challenge starting on July 13th, the short interim 
project estimated to last around ten days, intended to show the weakness of 
56 bit encryption. An award of in total US $10,000 is connected to this 
effort, part of which could go to the Amiga team and the individual finding 
the key. Our chances are indeed excellent with over 1000 contributing 
members governing nearly 2000 machines in total.

The Amiga RC5 Team effort is also providing a mailinglist as a forum for 
the discussion on above topics and the effort in general.

For additional info on how to participate and more in depth explanation, 
please visit the Amiga RC5 Team effort homepage at:
