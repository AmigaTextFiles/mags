2. Phase 5 &auml;ndert Spezifikationen der PowerPC-G3/G4-Karten

»Update on the Next Generation G3 Product for the AMIGA from phase 5
digital products

July 6, 1999: The recently announced G3/G4 project is now already in it's
finalization stage. During the past six weeks, we have reviewed the
overwhelming response of the Amiga community, and the large number of
requests from many users in regards to design features. At the same time,
we have been checking the latest developments in the industry, which have
opened up some new opportunities. Based on these new possibilitites, we
have made some conceptual changes to the design of the CYBERSTORM G3/G4
and the BLIZZARD G3/G4 boards which we will outline hereafter.

A major change of the design of both boards is that we have decided not to
integrate SCSI and IEEE-1394 on the products as standard, and therefore
reduce the base prices of the products (we will make add-ons available,
and have also added other features, as you can read below). We have
decided to do this, as we found out that many customers have very
different demands. For example, many have been asking for implementation
of the U2W SCSI interface - even for the BLIZZARD G3/G4 board - which is
more expensive and would later also cause significant additional cost to
the user in respect to cabling and adaptors. On the other hand, other
customers may only want to connect some older legacy SCSI devices and
would be happy with a cheap 8-Bit SCSI port. Some other may not need SCSI
at all, but want to pay the lowest possible price for the step into the
G3/G4 generation. Consequently, we have decided to offer base boards
without specialized I/O functionality, but with the option for customized
configurations.

The good news is, that the CYBERSTORM G3/G4 as well as the BLIZZARD G3/G4
will both have PCI slots already on board, which will allow to connect PCI
add-ons directly. In order to make the boards fit into the same Amiga
systems as the earlier CYBERSTORM PPC and BLIZZARD 603 boards, we will be
using Mini-PCI connectors, on which PCI modules in the new Mini-PCI
standard can be installed. This design allows the users to connect
Mini-PCI add-on cards directly to the CYBERSTORM G3/G4 as well as the
BLIZZARD G3/G4, without the need to spend money for a PCI bus expansion or
to worry about mechanical integration of such a board. Developers, as well,
can easily use either common Mini-PCI cards and write drivers for those, or
quickly design new Mini-PCI cards with standard PCI chips.

Another change is the usage of standard SO-DIMMs (SDRAM) as they can be
found on modern notebooks, which also allow to design the boards in very
compact form factors, thus making the CYBERSTORM G3/G4 fit into all A3000
and A4000 desktop and tower models (with fully installed memory and
Mini-PCI cards), and make the BLIZZARD G3/G4 fit into most A1200 tower
cases on the market and in use. As an integrated standard I/O port, the
CYBERSTORM G3/G4 as well as the BLIZZARD G3/G4 will also have two USB
ports to connect a fast growing number of inexpensive devices.

phase 5 digital products will also be offering some cost-effective MiniPCI
add-on modules. We have a number of options which add-on boards for I/O
purposes may be developed by us, and which will be quickly realized
depending on the actual demand. It may be noted that these options include
those functions which were originally considered to be on-board, and are
now simply moved to an optional MiniPCI card. The currently planned,
optionally available modules include:

   o An U2W SCSI controller w/ internal 68pin port and active termination,
     for a net retail price of EURO 150 or US$160

   o An Ultra SCSI controller w/ internal 50pin port and active
     termination, for a net retail price of EURO 80 or US$90

   o An Ultra-DMA IDE/ATA controller 66MHz with 2 ports (to support 4
     devices) for a net retail price of EURO 80 or US$90

   o An IEEE-1394 Controller with 2 ports at 400Mbps, for a net retail
     price of EURO 100 or US$110

For any of these modules, a minimum order quantity of 250 units must be
reached, in order to justify the software and hardware realization. If for
any of these modules this quantity can not be reached, we will inform all
customers who have ordered this option. Customers can now - in the updated
ordering form - order these boards to be shipped with their BLIZZARD G3/G4
or CYBERSTORM G3/G4 board. These boards

phase 5 digital products will also offer a next-generation gfx board for
the new accelerators. This new board, the CyberVisionNG, is currently
planned to

   o incorporate a blazing fast 2D/3D graphics chip, with a powerful 128bit
     3D engine

   o feature a maximum resolution of 1920x1200x32 @ 72Hz

   o offer full video acceleration to support full-screen, full-frame DVD
     playback

and will be priced at EURO 180 or US$ 190 with 32 MB of local memory
(net retail price based on the memory prices of July 1999).

With the large amount of local memory for display and textures, it will
provide highest performance and impressive 3D capabilities which have not
been available on the Amiga ever before, at a most attractive price point
very close to that of common PC products.

A word on G4 versions:

It seems today that with the initial release of the BLIZZARD and CYBERSTORM
G3/G4 boards, the G4 processors may not be shipping in quantities. But it
is even more important that support of the improved features of the G4
processor by Amiga software applications, developers and tools will take
time, and it is very unlikely that wider support of these features - which
the Amiga users would benefit from - will be realized before early next
year. Because of this reason (and yet undetermined pricing and available
frequencies), we have decided to remove the G4 offer from the product list
right now. We believe that the time for the G4 will come in the year 2000,
after Amiga developers have implemented G4 support into software
applications, and availability and pricing of the G4 processors makes them
an even more attractive choice than in the very near future. Remember, both
the BLIZZARD and the CYBERSTORM G3/G4 have a socketed processor module,
which will allow for easy upgrading - and phase 5 digital products will
offer attractively priced G4 modules as soon as the G4 processors are
shipping in quantities.
