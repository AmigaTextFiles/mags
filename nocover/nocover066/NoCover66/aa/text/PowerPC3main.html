3. QNX gibt nicht auf: Umsetzung f&uuml;r Phase5-PowerUp-Karten geplant

»QNX&#174; and phase 5 Team Up to Provide Migration Path for AMIGA&#174; Users

                                                      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Kanata, Canada and Oberursel, Germany - July 22, 1999 - QNX Software
Systems and phase 5 digital products have announced a licensing agreement
that allows phase 5 to port the QNX Neutrino OS to its current line of
PowerUPTM accelerators for Amiga computers.

Once the port is completed, the two companies will donate a runtime version
of the OS free of charge to the Amiga community. This version will run on
all current 603/604-based PowerUP boards.

"By teaming up with the leading manufacturer of hardware upgrades for Amiga
computers, we're taking the next step in our growing commitment to the
Amiga community," said Dan Dodge, CTO at QNX Software Systems. "More
importantly, Amiga developers will benefit in at least two ways. First,
they can use their existing Amiga computers to develop next-generation
multimedia applications based on the QNX Neutrino OS. QNX application
development will be completely self-hosted; no PCs required. Second, they
can run their legacy Amiga applications and new QNX applications
simultaneously, thanks to a powerful 68k emulator from phase 5, which will
provide Amiga OS 3.x support."

"QNX provides all the software functionality - and more - to fulfill the
expectations of the many users who still believe in the original Amiga
vision: a vision of technical superiority, innovation, and just plain
fun," said Wolf Dietrich, general manager of phase 5 digital products. "By
putting all these features, OS services, and tools straight into the hands
of Amiga developers, we expect that a large number of applications running
under QNX for PowerUP boards will be released quickly."

Phase 5 also has the option to license QNX for future standalone systems
based on next-generation PowerPC processors.

Availability

The QNX Neutrino OS for PowerUP boards, including applications, windowing
system, drivers, and Amiga 68k emulation system, will ship with the new
phase 5 Blizzard and Cyberstorm G3 accelerators, which are scheduled for
delivery in Fall 99.

For users of current 603/604-based PowerUP boards, the ported runtime
package will be available for free download via the Internet, or on CD for
a nominal fee (to cover handling and postage).
