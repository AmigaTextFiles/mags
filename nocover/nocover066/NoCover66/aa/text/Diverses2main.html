2. Exodus k&uuml;ndigt Digital-Video-Workstation auf Basis des AmigaNG an 

»Exodus Multimedia is pleased to announce the first AmigaNG-powered digital
video workstation, Maverick! While still in the design and engineering
stage, we have committed to delivering this exciting new concept to the
video industry. Our decision to proceed with this project was reached after
a private meeting with Jeff Schindler and Darreck Lisle at the St.Louis
Amiga show. After talks with Amiga Inc. which lasted into the early hours
of the morning, it was decided that the new OS offers significant
advantages over other operating systems, in terms of size, speed,
reliability and flexibility. From its inception, the AmigaOS was designed
to handle full motion video, graphics and animation. The AmigaNG version
promises to improve on this base technology and add features not seen on
any other platform. Our current line of digital video workstations is based
on Windows 98 and NT plus the Newtek Video Toaster Flyer. While we are very
early into this project, we will provide more concrete specifications by
summer's end. The tower case will be based on the current design used on
our standard workstation, pictures of which can be seen on our web page at
www.exodusmm.com.

"The Amiga has proven to be the leading OS for video production on a large
and small scale. To this day, there are 15 year old Amigas still being used
to do mainsteam video, while most other computing platforms are obsolete
within two years. It is our goal to take Maverick into the 21st century
with an OS and hardware capable of supporting new standards like HDTV, DV
and MPEG-2 all with realtime video effects and transitions. The AmigaOS
gives us that power!", said Stan Carver, President of Exodus Multimedia.

&gt;From the last poll, there were over 7 million Classic Amigas sold to date.
To show our support for the Classic Amigas, we have been working with Mick
Tinker of Access Innovation, a European company, to provide a state of the
art solution that would allow current Amiga owners to take advantage of new
technologies without sacrificing backwards compatibility. Based on
specifications provided by Exodus Multimedia, the new motherboard will have
a PowerPC processor, PCI slots and fast SDRAM, in addition to Amiga
specific devices like Zorro slots and an high speed emulation of the custom
chipset. Full Video Toaster and Flyer support will be provided as well. The
use of new technologies will make way for devices currently on the Windows
platform such as FireWire, USB, pro audio sound cards and high end graphics
cards to be easily ported to the AmigaOS without having to redesign
hardware. The new Amiga-powered Maverick should be available 3rd quarter
1999.

In the meantime, we have salesmen and service technicians that are fully
capable of supporting the Amiga community, as we always have. We are now
taking pre-orders for OS 3.5 and look forward to the new AmigaNG with all
of it's possibilities. We will post details on our web page as we progress
with this project- STAY TUNED!
