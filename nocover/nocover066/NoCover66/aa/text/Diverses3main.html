»aMozillaX Status and News Report - 28/7/99

Its been a while since we last made any sort of status report. I feel that
we should now tell you all how we are getting on. Firstly, we would just
like to say that we are still very much commited to bringing Netscape to
the Amiga, and we haven't given up. However, due to many problems we have
encountered recently, including university, exams, lack of coders, other
commitments and so on, we are behind schedule and have missed most of our
deadlines.

The hype surrounding this product was far too early, and in my opinion and
would have been much more suited just before we actually had something to
release.

One our goals was to provide a much more competitive and lively atmosphere
in the Amiga Browser scene and we very much hope that we have suceeded.
The state of the Amiga Browser scene is very good, especially with the
number of browsers growing steadily with aMozilla, Voyager 3, iBrowse 2,
AWeb, iProbe and Dry Ice.

Depending on the layout engine, we hope to have an early beta version out
within the next couple of weeks. We cannot yet say what features this is
likely to incorporate as it all depends on how various things go.

The first repease will incorporate the initial releases of our Network,
Layout and Image decoding libraries and the full developer documentation
will be released. In acccordance with the Netscape Public Licence (NPL and
MPL) all sources that originated from the Mozilla source tree will be made
available from our website.

We are expecting to have a full release somewhen in the fourth quarter of
this year. This release will have most, if not all of all the features we
are planning on implementing. Details of these will be made available.
This list is getting more impressive by the day...

I would also like to ask for anyone who is willing to help us in our
efforts to contact me (ian@freeamiga.org. We are looking for coders,
people to design a brand new splash screen and transfer and people to help
write help documents.

We hope to start a weekly update on the progress of aMozilla so everyone
can see how we're getting on and how close we are to fufilling our
targets. This will be available from our website soon.

Finally, we would like to clarify the exact spelling of aMozillaX... (Its
got a small 'a' :-)«
