<h4><center>Willkommen zum dritten Teil der Metal-Lyrics. Nachdem es
doch schon einige Monate her ist seit dem letzten Teil dieser Rubrik, wird
es mal wieder Zeit für ein paar lyrische Ergüsse aus der härtesten, und
ehrlichsten Sparte
der Musik. Teil II widmete sich Ayreon`s "Universal Migrator"-Geschichte
 - aber bevor ich ein weiteres Konzept aufgreifen möchte, nun mal zur
abwechslung ein paar vereinzelte Songs hochkarätiger Bands.<p>Heavy Greets,<p>

 <b><h2>Saxon - Shadows On The Wall</b></h2><P>
 <h3>In A Desert Valley, Near The Rio Grande,
 Through The Sun Baked Wasteland, Cross the Burning Sand.
 On The Edge Of Nowhere, In A Hidden Place,
 They Were Looking For The Answer, To The Power Of The Sun.<p>

 From Out Of The Sky Came The Burning Death - Could Anyone Forsee ?
 The Raging Terror Coming From Above - To Erase Humanity !
 In A Blinding Flash Came The Fireball - Melting Skin And Bone,
 It Was A Mighty City Just Blown Away - Like Dust Before The Storm !<p>

 There Is No City - There Are No People,
 There`s Only Shadows On The Wall...
 Where Is The City - Where Are The Poeple ?
 There`s Only Shadows On The Wall...<p>

 Children Were Playing, In Los Alamos,
 Nuclear Fusion, Critical Mass.
 Start A Chain Reaction, Build The Doomsday Toy,
 Split The Tiny Atom, Your Little Boy.<p>

 It Was A Clear Blue Morning, On That Fateful Day,
 Silver Wings Of Destruction, The Enola Gay.
 Unleash The Awesome Power, Release It From It`s Cage,
 Opening The Doorway, To The Nuclear Age.<p>

 There Is No City - There Are No People,
 There`s Only Shadows On The Wall...
 Where Is The City - Where Are The Poeple ?
 There`s Only Shadows On The Wall...<p></h3>

 <b><h2>Angra - Gentle Change</b></h2><P>
 <h3>I See The Stars In Your Eyes,
 Portraying My Face In The Future.
 Nice Is The Weather Outside,
 But I`ll Stay At Home.
 Waiting For The Rain...<p>

 Memories Of When We Were Young,
 Wishing So Bad To Be Older.
 Now You May Look To The Past,
 The Only Way Forward.<p>

 Lighting Up Another Cigarette,
 Playing Cool While Cracking Up Inside.
 Saying Hi To People`s Like Saying Goodbye,
 Laughing, But Wishing To Cry.<p>

 Gentle Change Of Tides - Upcoming Days,
 The Spirits Of A New Horizon Fall - Into Old Dreams.<p>

 Standing Here Howling At The Storm,
 Shouting How Life Could Be Perfect.
 Well, Then The Walls Have To Fall,
 To Start It Again.<p>

 Far Away From Sights - Hidden In The Haze,
 Spirits Of A New Horizon Fall - Into Old Dreams.<p></h3>

 <b><h2>Dream Theater - Scarred</b></h2><P>
 <h3>To Rise, To Fall,
 To Hurt, To Hate.
 To Want, To Wait,
 To Heal, To Save.<p>

 Can`t Hear It, We Fear It,
 Awareness Won`t Come Near It !
 Distractive, Reactive...
 ...Disguised In Spite Of Time.<p>

 I Never Bared My Emotions, My Passion Always Strong,
 I Never Lost My Devotion, But Somewhere Fate Went Wrong !
 Can`t Let Them Rape Me Again, Your Venom`s Not Family Here,
 Won`t Let Them Fill Me With Fatalistic Remedies !<p>

 What If The Rest Of The World Was Hopelessly Blinded By Fear ?
 Where Would My Sanctity Live ? Suddenly Nobody Cares.<p>

 It`s Never Enough, You`re Wasting Your Time,
 Isn`t There Something I Could Say ?
 You Don`t Understand, You`re Closing Me Out,
 How Can We Live Our Live This Way ?<p>

 You tell Me I`m Wrong, I`m Risking My Life,
 Still I Have Nothing In Return.
 I Show You My Hands, You Don`t See The Scars,
 Mybe You`ll Leave Me Here To Burn.<p>

 What If The Rest Of The World Was Hopelessly Drowning In Vain ?
 Where Would Our Self Pity Run ? Suddenly Everyone Cares.<p>

 Blood - Heal Me,
 Fear - Change Me...
 ...Belief Will Always Save Me.
 Blood - Swearing,
 Fear - Staring...
 ...Conviction Made Aware.<p>

 Give up On Misery, Turn Your Back On Dissent,
 Leave Their Distrust Behind, Wash Your Hands Of Regret.<p>

 Do You Feel You Don`t Know Me Anymore ?
 And Do You Feel I`m Afraid Of Your Love ?
 And How Come You Don`t Want Me Asking ?
 And How Come My Heart`s Not Invited ?
 You Say You Want Everyone Happy...
 ...Well, We`re Not Laughing !
 And How Come You Don`t Understand Me ?
 And How Come I Don`t Understand You ?
 Thirty Years Say We`re in This Together - So Open Your Eyes:<p>

 People In Prayer For Me, Everyone`s There For Me,
 But Sometimes I Fell I Should Face This Alone !
 My Soul Exposed,
 It Calms Me To Know That i Won`t...<p>

 Blood - Heal Me,
 Fear - Change Me...
 ...Belief Will Always Save Me.
 Blood - Swearing,
 Fear - Staring...
 ...Conviction Made Aware.<p>

 Learning From Misery, Staring Back At Dissent,
 Leaving Distrust Behind, I`m Inspired And Content.<p></h3>

 <b><h2>Ayreon - Abbey Of Synn</b></h2><P>
 <h3>Once Upon A Time As In Ancient History,
 High Upon A Hill In A Shroud Of Mistery,
 Loomed The Abbey As We Journeyed Through The Night,
 And Wended Our Way Towards The Light.<p>

 As We Entered Through The Gates We Heard The Silent Calls,
 There Was Something Evil That Lurked Within These Walls,
 As I Relive My Days In This God Forsaken Place,
 All That Appears Before Me Now - Is Her Face !<p>

 Another Man Died Today Like The Ones Before,
 With Blackened Tongue And Blackened Fingers.
 Within The Labyrinth Behind The Bolted Door,
 Lies The Answer To Our Mistery.<p>

 Heed The Book That Kills - It Holds An Evil Power,
 Those Who Turn The Leaves - Wither Like A Flower.
 Well Guarded By The Seer - Inside The Abbey Tower,
 For Laughter Kills The Fear Within - The Abbey Of Synn.

 We Found The Secret Path That Led Us Here To You,
 Give Us The Deadly Book Of Laughter.
 Too Many Men Have Died For A Teaching Of The Few,
 Open You Heart, Reveal The Mistery.

 And Then She Came To Me Like A Creature From The Dawn,
 Enchanting As The Moon, Radiant As The Sun.
 She Took The Boy In Me And Gave Me Back The Man,
 With A Force I Could Not Withstand.

 The Seer Burned The Abbey Down - And Perished In The Fire,
 We Couldn`t Save The Book - The Flames Were Rising Higher.
 So Many Died In Vain - For An Ancient Discipline,
 Laughter Kills The Fear Within - The Abbey Of Synn.
