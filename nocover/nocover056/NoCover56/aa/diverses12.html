PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX just has joined RegNet - The Registration Network:

                      <a href="http://www.reg.net">http://www.reg.net</a>

Several of our separate programs and bundles now can be ordered
online by using credit cards and other paying servives as
offered by Regnet.

HOWEVER YOU STILL CAN ORDER DIRECTLY FROM US.

RegNet can accept nearly all kinds of payment. They take the following 
credit cards: MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Novus (Discover). For 
high ticket items (over $150) they can issue an invoice against a purchase 
order for payment by check or credit card. They also accept money orders or 
checks (payable to Wintronix or RegNet).

If you don't have a credit card, RegNet can accept cash, check or money 
order.
Be sure to include all of your contact information with your payment. Make

  #2667     (T)WinIFF                            27 USD  (20+7)             
                                                                 keyfile(s)
  #2669     (1) + PNG-Box                        61 USD  (50+11)   keyfiles
  #2670     (2) + PNG-Box                        77 USD  (64+13)            
                                                         keyfiles, binaries


In the brackets you see that I had to increase the prices by the
costs that Regnet takes from me (10 percent of the price plus 5 USD).
Note, that this isn't a fee taken for credit card payment, but a
fee resulting out of the fact that RegNet has to be paid for its service.

However, you save the costs and the risk of shipping the money via
snail mail to me, the expensive costs to do postal money orders
and so on. Also, by chosing a bundle, you still may save some money.
We, on the other hand, have to pay additional fees for cashing
the american cheques Regnet will send us - so, it's fair.

Shipment always takes place via eMail, no media will be sent.
