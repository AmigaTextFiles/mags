13. Cloanto bringt neue Online-Version von Amiga Forever auf den Markt

»NEW VERSION OF AMIGA FOREVER ONLINE EDITION RELEASED

We are pleased to announce that a new version of Amiga Forever Online
Edition is available for download. For this release, both the preinstalled
Amiga software and the WinUAE emulation have been updated and improved.

The 68K CPU emulation has been carefully profiled and optimized, and is now
on average at least 20% faster than in the previous version. CPU-wise, an
average PC can now comfortably emulate a 68040 Amiga (benchmarks are based
on Personal Paint compilation times using SAS/C, Amiga 4000/040 and Pentium
II/400 PC). Experimental AGA emulation and MIDI output are now also
supported by the emulation and already have many enthusiastic users (some 
of which can now at last use Bars & Pipes Pro!) Features such as virtual
memory, floating point unit, true color RTG display modes and TCP/IP
continue to be part of the default Amiga Forever emulation configuration.
The latest version of the Amiga Explorer Amiga-PC networking software is
also included.

The new version of Amiga Forever Online Edition is available for immediate
download from cloanto.com at $29.99. Amiga users in Yugoslavia have 
reported credit card authorization problems in relation to the current 
situation, and can therefore get the software at no cost directly from 
Cloanto.

Existing CD-ROM and Online Editions of Amiga Forever can be upgraded to the
latest version of the emulation software following the instructions at
cloanto.com. The Amiga Forever pages have been completely updated and now
provide even more resources for users of Amiga emulation. The Amiga Forever
Home Page has a new, easy to remember browser shortcut: amigaforever.com.
Other Amiga product pages at cloanto.com have been moved to a "Classic
Amiga" section, in preparation for new software titles for Amiga NG.

We are observing with interest that the emulation topic is currently being
hotly debated both on the internet and in the courts. We would like to 
point out that Amiga Forever stands out as a unique example of careful and
complete licensing of the technology being emulated. Cloanto has licensed
the entire portfolio of Amiga patents, trademarks and copyrights before 
even considering the publication of the emulation, ROM and OS components 
which are part of Amiga Forever.

Once again, we would like to thank all Amiga users for their continued
support!

Your Cloanto Team
