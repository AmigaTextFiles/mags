This is just one of many concept drawings for the next generation Amigas.
We have release a full set of drawings to the Amiga press for publication.
Amiga is planning to come out with a next generation multimedia computer in
late Q4 of the year. This computer will have a unique architecture, a great
operating system, awesome 3D graphics performance, advanced multimedia
features, and will be extremely easy to use. I am confident that this
computer will meet your expectations for a great next generation Amiga.
Unfortunately, we can't disclose details of the new computer yet since we
are under non-disclosure agreements with our technology partners. We also
need to be careful about alerting our competition to our plans. One thing I
can say is that the technology partners we are working with are extremely
excited about our direction and technology. There are Amigans in all major
technology companies and they are eager to support us in driving a new
computer revolution. These partners include some major technology and
component companies in the computer industry. We should be ready to
disclose more at the World of Amiga and AmiWest shows in July.

The new Amiga multimedia computer will also support a home networked
"information appliance" environment that will allow networked devices
throughout the house access to the power and features of this computer. I
need to clarify the term "information appliances" which is becoming a
popular term in the computer industry. "Information appliances" are not
digital toasters, refrigerators, and ovens with LCD displays. They are
devices such as wireless LCD tablets, Internet terminals, game machines,
and digital set-top boxes. These devices will all be connected together
through a single network and will be integrated into a single comprehensive
operating environment. This is the reason why we use the term "operating
environment", or OE, to describe our new software rather than operating
system. Our software is much more than the underlying operating system. The
goal is to have Amiga compatible computer devices available throughout the
house allowing people easy access to multimedia, games, and information.«
