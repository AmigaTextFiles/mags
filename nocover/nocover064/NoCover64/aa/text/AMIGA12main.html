12. AMIGA k&uuml;ndigt gleichzeitige Teilnahme an zwei wichtigen Messen an

»San Diego - May 21, 1999 - Amiga announces participation at AmiWest99 and 
World of Amiga 99 shows.

Amiga will be supporting and participating at two major Amiga shows in 
July, AmiWest99 in Sacramento, California and World of Amiga 99 in London, 
England.  These shows will occur over the same weekend.  

"Participating in two shows at the same time will present some challenges 
but we are looking forward to simultaneously discussing our plans for the 
future with great audiences on two continents," said Jim Collas.  "We are 
looking at ways to connect the two events and show that Amiga users 
represent a great worldwide community."

Amiga executives will be at both of the shows, and look forward to sharing 
more details about what we have been doing over the past few months and how 
we are moving towards the future.

We look forward to seeing as many of you as possible at the shows.«
