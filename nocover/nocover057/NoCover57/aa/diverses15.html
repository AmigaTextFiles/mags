The ninth public release of AmIRC, version 2.2, is now available!

AmIRC is a client for the IRC Internet Relay Chat protocol written by
Oliver Wagner, also the author of VoyagerNG and Microdot II. It is
*SHAREWARE*.  You can register it easily with the included VaporWare
registration utility at any of our registration sites around the world.

Although AmIRC 2.2 contains numerous more hours of work and thus is
slightly more expensive than AmIRC 1.x, there is *NO UPGRADE FEE* --
your legal AmIRC 1.x and AmIRC 2.x keyfile will continue to work.  The
free upgrade is our &quot;Thank you!&quot; to all the people who already
registered AmIRC 1.x, instead of using cracked versions, pirated key
files or &quot;evaluation periods&quot; of several months or even years.
Registrations at the AmIRC 1.x price are *no longer accepted* as of
the 2.0 release.

For a detailed list of changes since V2.1, see below.

Note: Due to a yet undetermined reasons, the vapor_update
auto updater failed to properly download the amirc archive
from the ftp.us.vapor.com FTP site. The update database has
been changed to point to ftp.vapor.com and the auto update
process should now work.

New features since AmIRC's last major release (2.0) include:

- Single window mode. You can join several channels with opening
  just a single window.

- Total queueing. Now everything which isn't urgent (like
  KICKS or MODE changes) is sent through the output queue.
  to reduce risk of being kicked by a server due to flooding.

- Settable scrollback buffer size. The amount of text stored
  in a window's scrollback buffer is now limited; the number
  of lines to keep can be configured.

- Vapor Update Library. Will now automagically check for
  available updates during startup, and inform you if there
  is one -- which you can automatically download, too.

- New plugin API calls. On request by plugin authors, several
  new callbacks and functions have been implemented in the
  AmIRC plugin API.

- Multiselect ban list window

- openurl.library support

- new translations done by ATO (<a href="http://ato.vapor.com/ato">http://ato.vapor.com/ato</a>)

- several bug fixes and minor improvements (for a complete
  list, refer to the history attached below)

New features since the 1.69 release include:

- Query and channel windows can now be iconified individually to a
  &quot;tray&quot; window. Tray window button labels turn bold when new messages
  are received, white when a highlight occurs, and carry information
  about the number of messages in each window.

- New low-level Plugin API. Documentation of the API is available from
  <a href="http://www.vapor.com">www.vapor.com</a> or Aminet, in a separate archive. An example plugin,
  WallChop.AmiPlug, is included.

- Server list is now a ListTree object with subgroups for different
  networks.

- Can now use MIMEPrefs to automatically view &amp; save files received via
  DCC. Activate the &quot;Use MIMEPrefs to view?&quot; or &quot;Use MIMEPrefs to save?&quot;
  menu options.

- &quot;Lag-O-Meter&quot; (tm ;)) probes the IRC server every 30 seconds and shows
  the current lag from 0-10+ in a gauge below the userlist. The Info
  window also contains the three most recent measurements and the
  average.

- Heavily improved logging. All channel and query windows now have an
  &quot;L&quot; button to the right of the input gadget, which is a toggle button
  to activate the logging to a user-specified directory.

- &quot;Favorites&quot; window added to store the names of channels you use
  regularly. Click on the channel name in a window to open.

- AmIRC now uses NList.mcc (if available) for its listviews. NList is
  written by Gilles Masson (<a href="mailto:masson@iut-soph.unice.fr">masson@iut-soph.unice.fr</a>).

- Stronger CTCP flood protection.

- DCC connections now work with Miami's SOCKS support.

- Files received via DCC are opened in shared mode during transfer,
  so you can play or view them partially while the transfer is still
  in progress (esspecially for all you mp3 freaks out there :-)

- DCC receives now have the options to Replace a file. Both the send
  and receive windows have Cleanup buttons, to remove old closed and
  failed connections.

- DCCs now show the estimated remaining time of a transfer based
  on current throughput.

- Query windows now have an N button to change the nickname the window
  is currently bound to.

- Background color of AmIRC's main listviews can now be configured.

- /AWAY messages are now filtered, and only shown once to avoid screen
  cluttering when talking to someone who is set /AWAY.

- special &quot;Invite&quot; and &quot;Oper&quot; requesters

- Can now automatically accept DCC Send requests.

- Now sends pertinent information to query windows, such as /nick and
  /QUIT messages from that user, as well as CTCP and DCC messages.

Changes since Release 2.1
-------------------------

2.1.1alpha
----------
- net: added workaround for output queue locking up
  when system clock was set back
- main: main loop now using MUIM_Application_NewInput for
  less overhead
- main: fixed a stupid Patchwork hit in checking whether
  V was running
- demo: demo version crashed on quit by pushing a method
  on the then no more existant MUI application object. Ahem.

2.1.2alpha
----------
- gui: fixed window close race condition which could cause
  the window list updater to reference a no more existant
  GUI object

2.1.3alpha
----------
- dcc: now accepts DCC SENDs from PC IRC clients which carry
  the filename enclosed in quotes

2.1.4alpha
----------
- gui: now deals with things like doing &quot;MODE -v&quot; on ops

2.1.5alpha
----------
- log: now prefixes window log entries with a time stamp

2.1.6alpha
----------
- net: added &quot;Terminal login mode&quot;. In this mode, AmIRC wil
  open a &quot;mini telnet&quot; connection window after the initial
  server connect(). This allows you to bypass any firewalls,
  use relays or whatever. Start with &quot;AmIRC TerminalMode&quot; (or
  &quot;AmIRC TM&quot;)

2.1.7alpha
----------
- gui: top right ban mask button didn't work at all
- gui: kickbanwin default ban is now *!*user@*.do.main
  or *!*user@ip1.ip2.ip3.* for IP masks
- gui: now strips down username to 10 chars in ban,
  and automatically fills in a &quot;*&quot; at the end to come
  around the dreaded undernet bug
- command: /kickban now also utilizes the 10 char 
  username cutdown

2.1.8alpha
----------
- plugins: updated wallchop.amiplug to work with &quot;+v&quot; and
  the internal &quot;%&quot; flag (@ and +) (Version 2.1)
- dcc: added support for the Genesis SOCKS5 wrapper
  library for DCC SEND/CHAT
- general: now correctly escapes shell special codes when
  &quot;Connecting Thread&quot; (e.g. &quot;*&quot; in channel names)
- gui: input lines now have the textinput popup menu attached
  (mainly for CM support)

2.2
---
- net: added kludge against the lame &quot;CTCP ECHO +++ATH0&quot; hack.
  Will report CTCP PINGs with &quot;+++&quot; in them as a flood, and
  ignore them blatantly (&quot;&laquo;Flood&raquo; Excess 7 bytes CTCP ECHO request
  from &#060;nick&#062; ignored&quot;)
- included updated Regtool
- included Textinput 13.42&laquo;
