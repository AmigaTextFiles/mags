&raquo;PRODUCT NAME

        MooVId v0.33b
        
        (NOTE: used to be AVId; the new name reflects the addition of

DEMO VERSION

        The demo version (v0.99998) is available from Aminet as
        gfx/show/AVId.lha, but has the following limitations:

        &middot; Plays only the first 400 frames (approximately 30 seconds @ 15    
          fps).
        
        &middot; No STORM support, and the GUI is disabled.

        &middot; No Intel Indeo support
        

SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                1 MB CHIP or FAST RAM and a hard drive is required.

                A 68020 or faster processor, and an ECS/AGA Amiga or
                graphics card is also required. (note: with an ECS
                Amiga, output is limited to 16-color grayscale).
                
                Recommended hardware: 68040/68060 processor (or 68030
                w/graphics card), a hard drive with at least a 1MB/sec
                transfer rate, and 1 MB FAST RAM.
                

        SOFTWARE
        
                reqtools.library v.38 or higher.
                Amiga OS 3.0 or higher.

                Picasso96 or CyberGraphX (currently untested) driver
                software (always use the latest version).

                MooVId works fine under Amiga OS 3.1, and requires it
                for both the AKIKO and SDBL functions. I have not been
                able to test it under other versions of the Amiga OS,
                but it should run OK under 2.x, and even better on
                3.0.


COPY PROTECTION

        None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        Amiga 2500 w/2630 (25MHz '030) w/68 MB Fast RAM, 1 MB Chip RAM.
        PicassoII graphics card running latest Picasso96 driver software.
        Toshiba XM-5701 SCSI-2 12X CD-ROM drive (internal).
        AIR 1.76MB external floppy disk drive.
        A2091 SCSI Controller w/Guru ROM.
        Seagate 1 GB internal hard drive.
        SyQuest EZFlyer 230 MB removable hard drive (external).
        Sony15sf 15&quot; multisync monitor.
        AmigaOS 3.1.
        

INSTALLATION

        Installation is simple, and therefore does not need the
        standard installer utility. You may copy MooVId anywhere you
        like on your hard drive as long as you have reqtools.library
        v.38 (or higher) in your LIBS: directory.

        types that can be viewed in the respective movie formats:

        Note: Intel Indeo support is ready, and the license has been
        promised, but not physically received as of this writing.

        STEREO and IMA4 (coming soon)

        MooVId has a control GUI that can be used with both playback
        modes: a window on Workbench, or a custom screen. The GUI
        sports the following controls from left to right:
        
        Top row -
        
        Play/Pause button
        Video track slider
        Frames/sec Display &amp; adjustment.
        
        Bottom row -
        
        Prev/Next AVI/MOV (when multiple files are selected)
        Volume slider
        Brightness slider
        Repeat movie toggle
        Skip frames toggle


DOCUMENTATION

        MooVId comes with standard AmigaGuide documentation which
        covers all the aspects of MooVId's features; how to get the
        best playback for your Amiga's configuration,
        troubleshooting/reporting bugs, and more.

        Keep in mind that while L&aacute;szl&oacute;'s native language is not
        English, he does a good job of keeping the documentation clear
        and to the point. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned
        Amiga user, you'll find the documentation helpful, and you
        shouldn't have many questions left to ask.


LIKES

        MooVId provides a very fast and stable movie player for the
        Amiga. It not only supports the major codecs, but also has
        optimized playback routines for 68040 and 68060 processors. It
        sports a control GUI on both custom screens and Workbench
        window configurations.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

        I have only two (major) suggestions for MooVId: add support
        for as many audio &amp; video codecs as possible, and add MPEG
        audio and video support.  I'm happy to say that these are
        L&aacute;szl&oacute;'s goals--as he gets time. He has already spent many
        hundreds of man-hours on MooVId, and--shameless plug--is
        likely to in the future, providing people register and show
        their support.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        MooVId is not the only player for Video for Windows (.avi) and
        Quicktime animations (.mov). CyberAVI/QT, TapAVI (no longer
        supported), XAnim, Mavi, and the Main Actor series also
        support one or both of these movie formats to varying degrees.
        
        Since I do not own either Mavi or Main Actor, I was unable to
        compare either of these movie players with MooVId. However,
        MooVId is without question from 2-3 times faster than
        CyberAVI/QT, TapAVI, and far in excess of XAnim. MooVId is
        optimized for fast playback speed even on modest Amigas, and
        it shows.
        

BUGS

        It's hard to complain about a product that is constantly being
        updated; it may not (currently) support all the codecs that
        CyberAVI/MOV does, but it supports all the major codecs, with
        more on the way. Most importantly, it is FAST. Even on a 25MHz
        '030, smaller movies (160 x 120) can get around 10-12
        fps--rates you won't currently find with CyberAVI/QT, or
        TapAVI.

        Since MooVId is constantly being improved, it is almost
        pointless listing bugs here--they would very likely be fixed
        by the time this review is released. Suffice it to say that
        any bug, properly reported, will be fixed.
        

VENDOR SUPPORT

        Support is very good. L&aacute;szl&oacute; strives to answer all e-mail
        within 24 hours, and is open to suggestions (register
        first!). Any bugs I personally have reported have (or will be)
        fixed and an updated version was sent to me via e-mail.
        

WARRANTY

        N/A.


CONCLUSIONS

        If you want a powerful movie player for your Amiga, get
        MooVId. It is well supported, and is constantly being
        improved. It is more than worth the registration fee when you
        consider the immediate access you have to the literally
        thousands of movies available from the Internet and PC
        community in general.
        
        I give MooVId a 9 out of 10.
