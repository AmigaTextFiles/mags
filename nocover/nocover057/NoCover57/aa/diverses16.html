ICOA Announces Changes and Goals

The ICOA (Industry Council Open Amiga) steering committee has chosen to 
refocus the ICOA. While the ICOA has always been about developers serving 
developers, a clear and understandable focus was needed. The ICOA steering 
committee has decided on a course that will reorganize itself into a 
professional society.
Much like a user group serves its members, the ICOA will now focus on
communications, resources, and issues relevant to developers.

Towards this the first step of many will be to establish the permanent ICOA 
web site. The current site was designed as an intermediate step during a 
process of creating the ICOA and hosting elections. The new site will be a 
resource to all developers, whether they choose to join ICOA or not. The 
web site will feature information specific to the ICOA such as its mailing 
lists, software and hardware development information and FAQs, production 
and marketing information, and other news and information that touches on 
all aspects of developing and publishing a product for the Amiga platform. 
A special feature in the works is an piracy reporting mechanism that 
maintains anonymity.

The web site is located at <a href="http://www.amiga.net">http://www.amiga.net</a> and will be initially 
active in the first weeks of October 1998. The site is designed to grow and 
is being built under the direction of the steering committee with the 
active work of Ted Wallingford and Gary Peake.

Future plans for the ICOA will depend highly on developer support. Regular
developer classes and seminars are already being hosted at nearly all Amiga
shows under the coordination of Steve Shireman and Kermit Woodall for the 
ICOA.
Coordination of these seminars will become a regular offering of the ICOA 
to Amiga trade shows that have the space and desire to host them.

Pending Amiga, Inc. participation, the ICOA plans to release a quarterly
newsletter and CDROM. The focus of the newsletter will be more than 
technical issues, it will include issues relating to running a business, 
producing artwork and advertising for a product and more. The CDROM will 
include a wide variety of contents that should include everything from code 
collections to catalogs of advertising and promotional products to help 
companies grow.

Like a user group, members of the ICOA will get out of it what they put 
into it.
Phrased in computer terms this will mean, 'garbage in = garbage out'. Right 
now with what's going into the web site and what we've seen of the ICOA 
seminars, we can say we're getting caviar - let's keep that direction as we 
move forward!

The ICOA is a professional society by and for developers. For more
