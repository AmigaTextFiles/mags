»FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                  Extreme Computing Announce Amiga X1200

Amiga Expo and Extreme Computing are pleased to bring you the following
press release. Please make plans now to visit Amiga Expo on March
29th-31st at the Marriott Hunt Valley Inn in Maryland where you will see
all the latest developments including those from our friends at Extreme
Computing!

Extreme Computing (a branch of Extreme Corporation) began reseach and
development of new Amiga-based products in the Spring of 1999. With the
announcement of the Amiga x86 solution in the Summer of 2001, we began
working overtime to come up with new designs of x86-based hardware that
would be powerful, functional, compelling, upgradable, and above all else
- Amiga and AmigaDE compliant!

The results have far exceeded our expectations. Our new line of x86 based
Amiga hardware will ultimately usher in new levels in design and
performance for the Amiga consumer computing experience. The main goal was
to give the consumers back a true Amiga system. One where you can take it
right out of the box and boot up to an Amiga screen without any hassles or
unnecessary complexity.

One of our guiding concepts was to combine classic designs with modern
technology - thus bringing you the Amiga X1200 computer system. This
system offers the design and compactness of the original Commodore Amiga
A1200, but with all new, and blazingly fast, hardware under the hood. The
Amiga X1200 is the ideal replacement, or addition, to your Amiga computing
needs.

The Amiga X1200 isn't the only exciting new hardware we have coming.
Extreme Corporation will have several MORE innovative and powerful Amiga
solutions on display at their booth at Amiga Expo. All of these designs
are will be shipping with Amiga OS x86(3.9) pre-installed and will come
with a full copy of Nova Design, Inc.'s ImageFX 3.2 on CDROM. As a special
show bonus, all orders placed at Amiga Expo will also come with FREE
SHIPPING.

Extreme Corporation (Formerly Amitech Electronics) was founded by Amiga
Enthusiasts to assist in providing Amiga Owners with useful tools and
information for an ever growing computing experience.

Nova Design, Inc. are the creators of Aladdin 4D and ImageFX - the Amiga's
most consistently top-rated image editing and special effects package and
are the hosts of Amiga Expo. See us all at the show!
