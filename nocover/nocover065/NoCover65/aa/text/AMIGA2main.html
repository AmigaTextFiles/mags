2. Neuester Stand der AMIGA-Hauptaktivit&auml;ten

»June/July 1999

Operations/Planning:
1) We have identified an office building for our operations in San Diego.
We will be moving out of the Gateway building into a separate building in
order to accommodate the expansion in Amiga's staff.

New Management Staff:
1) We hired Dave Curtis as director of object technology and transaction
services. Dave will be responsible for developing our transactional object
technology. Dave was one of the original architects of CORBA and has worked
for Inprise (Borland), the Object Management Group (OMG), and other
organizations focused on object oriented technology. Dave's expertise will
help us implement transactional object technology in the Amiga Operating
Environment.
2) We hired Dr. Jim Miller as director of user experience. Jim will be
responsible for all user interface design and software development. Jim has
worked in the human interaction groups of both Hewlett Packard and Apple
Computers. Jim is highly respected and well known in the national and
international user interaction (UI) community.

Major Development Programs:
1) O/S 3.5 - The target final release is August 21st at the Amiga Downunder
show in Australia. We are talking to Amiga hardware development companies
to qualify hardware products targeted at the O/S 3.5 release. We plan to
come out with a recommended hardware configuration and list of qualified
Amiga hardware products for the O/S 3.5 release.
2) AmigaSoftTM Operating Environment (OE) - We are developing our next
generation operating environment including operating system, user
interface, and some revolutionary software structures to be disclosed at a
later date. Target beta version is late 3Q99 with final in late 4Q99. We
are also looking at the possibility of porting this new AmigaSoftTM OE to
the O/S 3.5 recommended hardware configurations. If we can accomplish this
it will allow people to run the new OE on specific Amiga configurations
with PowerPC boards.
3) AmigaSoftTM development system - This is planned in late 3Q99 along with
the beta release of the new AmigaSoftTM Operating Environment.
4) Amiga Multimedia Convergence Computer (MCC):
- We have finalized our industrial design and created foam models.
- The next mechanical design step is hard models. These will be available
for WoA and AmiWest.
- We have initiated final schematics of the system board design.

Shows and Community Activities:
1) We held a telephone conference with the Amiga press to bring them up to
speed on our plans.
2) We received all of the nominations for Amiga Advisory Council (AAC)
members. We will be notifying the top nominated members for approval in the
next week. First AAC conference call should occur within two weeks.
3) We initiated multiple Amiga hosted forums accessible though our Amiga
website.
4) We will sponsor and participate in the 1999 London World of Amiga show
in late July.
5) We are also planning to support the AmiWest show in late July.
6) We are planning for the Cologne and Las Vegas shows in November.«
