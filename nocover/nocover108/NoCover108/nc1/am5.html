<P>Normalerweise wollen wir ja keine Texte aus der Df&uuml;
ver&ouml;ffentlichen. Das soll eine absolute Ausnahme sein. Und da wir
keine Texte ver&auml;ndern ist hier mal die englische Version:</P>

<P>I found this text in the latest magazine in Sweden: Dator Magazinet #19
1993</P>

<P>Now it have been comfirmed! The Amiga 5000 will be a multiple-platform
computer which can run both Windows NT and the operativsystem of Mac. It
will appaer in summer 1994. This was revealed by Commodore's Executive
Director in GB David Pleasance.</P>

<P>Rumours and speculations about Commodore's new Amiga model have been
circulated for a time in most foreing computer-magazines. But Commodore has
(as allways) denied this, and refused to give any information what so ever.
But now David Pleasance, known for "leaking" secret informations, opened
his mouth. I a interview by the english magazine Amiga Format he reveals
the essence of A5000.</P>

<P>Accordingly to DP it's a totally new step in the development of the
Amiga. Commodore have discarded the thought of making it backwards
compatible (so software for the A5000 can not run on any elder Amiga).
Instead they put all their effort in creating a RISC based Amiga, which
should be able to compete with all other platforms, based on the RISC and
Pentium processors. The A5000 will also be able to run Windows NT and
thereby PC applications that works with it. But on a A5000 the programs
will run 5 times faster than on a Pentium PC!</P>

<P>Theoretically we could put in Mac chips and run Mac-programs, says David
Pleasance. We aim on a computer that's open for anything. Amiga 5000 will
also have brand new graphics-chips called Trippel A which have 10 times
higher performance than today's AGA chips that comes in the A1200 &amp;
A4000. A5000 exists only as a prototype at the moment, but it will be
released in the summer of 1994. It won't be a computer designed for the
privat home. The price will probably be high, somewhere around the price
for a Pentium PC.</P>

<P>On the long term we will use the technology in the usual Amiga's too.</P>
