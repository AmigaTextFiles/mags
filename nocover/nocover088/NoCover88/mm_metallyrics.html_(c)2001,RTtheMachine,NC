<h4><center>Leider hat der Schwertkämpfer aus Herne schon seit längerem die Heavy Metal Lyrics aus seinem Corner genommen. Einer muss dem doch abhilfe schaffen ;-). Hier also ein paar wirklich lesenswerte Lyrische Ergüsse einiger der besten Heavy Metal Combos. Die sind natürlich nicht nur für Schwermetaller interessant, sondern auch für Leute, die mit dem Begriff "Heavy Metal" meist nur Satansanbetungen, Wildes herumgekreische und sinnlose Texte in Verbindung bringen. Tipp: Bei gefallen am besten mal in die angegebene Band reinhören - denn nur mit einer musikalischen Komponente entfaltet sich ein guter Songtext erst richtig. ;-)</center><p></h4>

 <b><h2>Bruce Dickinson - Jerusalem</b></h2><P>
 <h3>And Did Those Feet in Ancient Times,
 Walk Upon England`s Mountains Green ?
 And Was The Holy Lamb Of God,
 On England`s Pleasant Pastures Seen ?<P>

 And Did The Countenance Devine,
 Shine Forth On Our Clouded Hill ?
 Was Jerusalem Built Here,
 On England`s Green And Pleasant Land ?<P>

 Let It Rain, Let It Rain,
 Wash The Scales From My Eyes.
 Let It Rain, Let It Rain,
 Let Me See Again.<P>

 Bring Me My Bow Of Burning Gold,
 Bring Me My Arrows Of Desire.
 I Shall Not Sleep On Clouds Unfold,
 Bring Me My Chariot Of Fire.<P>

 Let It Rain, Let It Rain,
 Tears Of Blood Fall Out Of The Sky.
 Let It Rain, Let It Rain,
 Wash Me Clean Again.<P>

 From The Frozen Waters - The King Will Rise Again,
 With Two Suns In The Sky...
 I Shall Not Cease From Mental Fight,
 Nor Shall My Sword Sleep In My Hand.
 `Till We Have Built Jerusalem,
 In England`s Green And Pleasant Land.<P>

 See The Gleaming Spires Of The Citadel,
 The King And Queen Will Dwell - In Our Hearts.
 Can Jerusalem Be Rebuilded Here,
 In This Trivial Time - In This Land Of Fear ?
 In Jerusalem Where The Grail Remains,
 Walk Into The Light - And Dissolve The Chains.</h3><P>

 <b><h2>Edguy - The Headless Game</b></h2><P>

 <h3>Longing For Silence -
 Always Faster Is The Way That We Go.
 Not A Little Patience -
 Higher, Farer, Better We Grow.<P>

 The Beast Is Rising, It`s Tantalizing,
 Those Who Are Taking The Time.
 Alienation, A Revelation,
 Straight To The End Of The Line.<P>

 The Cold Chill You Feel Is No Dream, It`s For Real -
 We Don`t Follow !<P>

 Fly ! Riding Away, Rising Today,
 No We Don`t Play Your Headless Game.
 We Are Alive, Don`t Say Goodbye...<P>

 Cast Out From Eden -
 You Don`t Like What We Are In Your Eyes.
 We`re Leading The Treason -
 On The Race You Run The Way Of Your Life.<P>

 I am Danger, I`m A Stranger,
 Cause I Don`t Give In To Your Call.
 And Not Until She Is Satisfied,
 We Come And Explode And We Fall.<P>

 We`re Blowing The Frame Of Your Headless Game -
 We Don`t Follow !</h3><P>

 <h2><b>Dream Theater - Just Let Me Breathe</h2></b><P>

 <h3>Open Your Eyes - And Turn Off Your Mind,
 Step Right Up Folks - And You Will Find:
 A Growing Trend, An Epidemic,
 Spread With Zen And Hyperdomics.<P>

 Just Close Your Mind - You Can Find All You Need With Your Eyes.<P>

 The Big Machines Take Care Of You Until You Kill Yourself,
 And Then The Sales Go Through The Roof - Calculeted, Formulated.
 Feed My Head With Simple Thoughts,
 And Let Me Breathe Instead Of Being Taught.
 All Bottled Up And Tearing At The Seams,
 I`m Bored - Just let Me Breathe.<P>

 A Daily Dose Of EMpTyV,
 Will Flush Your Mind Right Down The Drain.
 Shannon Hoon And Kurt Cobain,
 Make Yourself A Household Name.<P>

 Strike Up Your Best Angst Ridden Posture - Manufactured Anger,
 Let`s Not Forget my Legacy.
 All My Heroes Have Failed Me,
 Now They`re Dead And Buried.<P>

 The Big Machines Will Take Care Of You,
 Until The Fashion fades And The Checks Go Through.
 My Bankroll`s Red And My Face Is Blue,
 And Still They Turn Their Backs On Me For Someone New.
 Feed My Head With Some Real Thoughts,
 And Let Me Think Instead Of Being Taught.
 I`ll Say Things You Won`t Believe,
 Just Stand Back - Just Let me Breathe.</h3><P>

 <b><h2>Helloween - Push</h2></b><P>

 <h3>They`re Spending Millions For Your Thrill,
 Collective Desperate Overkill.
 Wrapped Up In Harmless Words That Never Grin,
 Forbidden Games You`ll Never Win.
 The More You See The More You Know,
 Intended Media Mind Control.
 Shut Down And See How Beautiful Life Can Be...<P>

 This Is The Prime In Your Lifetime,
 You See Through Eyes Of Someone Else.
 More Than The Half Of Your Lifetime,
 Is Just A Tale In A Storybook.<P>

 Push, Enforce Your Independence,
 Push Your Real Intention.
 Face Your Unconscius Addiction,
 Push Your Private Fiction - Push !<P>

 It`s Getting Sicker Frame By Frame,
 You`re Always Starring At The Same.
 What Is A Lie, What Is The Truth,
 Incredible Disguisting News.
 The World Is Rough, The End Is Near,
 Just Calculation With Your Fear.
 Without A Shame Nor Least respect,
 The Operators Stand Errect.</h3><P>

 <b><h2>Bruce Dickinson - Tears Of The Dragon</b></h2><P>

 <h3>For Too Long Now - There Were Secrets In My Mind,
 For Too Long Now - There Were Things I Should Have Said.
 In The Darkness - I Was Stumbling Fo The Door,
 To Find A Reason - The Time, the Place, The Hour.<P>

 Waiting For The Winter Sun,
 And The Cold Light Of Day.
 The Misty Ghosts Of Childhood Fears...
 The Pressure Is Building,
 And I Can`t Stay Away.<P>

 I Throw Myself Into The Sea, Release the Wave,
 Let It Wash Over Me.
 To Face The Fear I Once Believed,
 The Tears Of The Dragon, For You And For Me.<P>

 Where I Was - I Had Wings That Couldn`t Fly,
 Where I Was - I Had Tears I Couldn`t Cry.
 My Emotions - Frozen In An Icy Lake,
 I Couldn`t Feel Them - Until The Ice Began To Break.<P>

 I Have No Power Over This,
 You Know I`m Afraid.
 The Walls I Build Are Crumbeling...
 The Water Is Moving,
 I`m Slipping Away.<P>

 Slowly I Awake,
 Slowly I Arise.
 The Walls I Build Are Crumbeling...
 The Water Is Moving,
 I`m Slipping Away.</h3><P>

 <b><h2>Hollow - Whispers</b></h2><P>

 <h3>Imagination has Not Served Me Well Lately,
 It`s Faint And Feeble Comfort Have But Died.
 In The Shadows Of My Hazy Dreams I Pass You By,
 And Life No Longer Thrills - Such Tears I Spill.<P>

 It`s The Sadest Tale I`ve Ever Known,
 Hear Me Cry To Absent Gods Against the Wind.
 I Will Tell You `Bout My Heart`s Desire,
 The Fire Burns Inside Me Still - And Always Will.<P>

 So Hear My Whispers In The Wind,
 Say Can You Feel My Pain ?
 A Storm Is Moving In And I`m Alone Again,
 I Whisper At The Wind That I`m Alone Again.<P>

 I Would Cry A Tear If You Should Say -
 Come To Me Now And Let Me Always By You Stay.
 I Know That It`s A Dream -
 I Wish That You Could See You Are All I Need.</h3><P>

 <h2><b>Metal Church - No Friend Of Mine</h2></b><P>

 <h3>No One`s Born With Hatred,
 It`s Something That You Learn.
 How Do You Think The Good Lord Feels,
 About The Crosses You Burn ?<P>

 What Makes You Hate The Difference Of Someone`s Skin Or Race ?
 You Must Think You Have More Rights To Be Living In This Place !<P>

 I Don`t Know What You Feel,
 Or Have You Lost Your Mind ?
 Afraid To Take A Look At Yourself,
 Afraid Of What You Can Find.
 You`re No Friend Of Mine !<P>

 The Dark Ages Are Over,
 In Case You Haven`t Heard.
 While You`re Lost In Ignorance,
 You Killed A Mockingbird.<P>

 Hide Behind Your Bed Clothes, Meet in Some Secret Place,
 One Day Soon This Hate You`ve Brewed Will Blow Up In Your Face !<P>

 Black And White And Yellow,
 Living Side By Side.
 The Children Always Play Together,
 We`ve Taught Them Otherwise.<P>

 All Men Created Equal - All Have Human Rights,
 So Tell Me Why We Hate Each Other - No Winners In The Fight !</h3><P>

 <b><h2>Dream Theater - Anna Lee</h2></b><P>

 <h3>Helpless Child - They Invite Your Hands To Fill Their Needs,
 Will You Be The Same ?
 Shameless Smile - To Steal From You The Innocence That Bleeds,
 Will They Feel Your Pain ?<P>

 Trying To Believe,
 The Scars Unseen - The Tears Wash Clean.
 You Don`t Wanna Breathe The Air You Breathe,
 You Don`t Know How You`ll Live A Life Alone.
 She Keeps Holding On,
 Holding On To You - Let Her Breathe The Air.
 Don`t Wanna Be Alone,
 Where Do You Belong - Anna Lee...<P>

 Behind Those Eyes - The Vivid Scene A Lucid Dream Within,
 Questioned Secrets Are Revealed.
 And Everytime - You Can`t Deny The Lines That Trace Your Skin,
 Wounds That Never Heal.<P>

 And Now She`s Calling Out A Name,
 Can`t Keep On Hiding All Her Pain.
 You Feel The Rain Move In As You Begin To Turn And Answer The Call.</h3><P>

 <b><h2>Iron Maiden - Blood Brothers</h2></b><P>

 <h3>And If You`re Taking A Walk Through The Garden Of Life,
 What Do You Think You`d Expect You Would See ?
 Just Like A Mirror Reflecting The Moves Of Your Life,
 And In The Mirror Reflections Of Me.<P>

 Just For A Second A Glimpse Of My Father I See,
 And In A Movement He Beckons To Me.
 And In A Moment The Memories Are All That Remain,
 And All The Wounds Are Reopening Again.<P>

 We`re Blood Brothers...<P>

 And As You Look All Around At The World In Dismay,
 What Do You See, Do You Think We Have Learned ?
 Not If You`re taking A Look At The War Torn Affray,
 Out In The Street Where The Babies Are Burnded.<P>

 We`re Blood Brothers...<P>

 There Are Times When I Feel I`m Afraid For The World,
 There Are Times I`m Ashamed Of Us All.
 When You`re Floating On All The Emotion You Feel,
 And Reflecting The Good And The Bad.
 Will We Ever Know What The Answer To Life Really Is ?
 Can You Really Tell Me What Life Is ?
 Maybe All The Things That You Know That Are Precious To You,
 Could Be Swept Away By Fate`s Own Hand.<P>

 We`re Blood Brothers...<P>

 When You Think That We`ve Used All Our Chances,
 And The Chance To Make Everything Right.
 Keep On Making The Same Old Mistakes,
 Makes Untipping The Balance So Easy.
 When We`re Living Our Lives On The Edge,
 Say A Prayer On The Book Of The Dead.</h3><P>

 <h2><b>Hollow - Secluded Dreams</b></h2><P>

 <h3>On The Fourteen-Inch Screen A World Is Opening Now,
 And You Leave The Old One Far Behind.
 The Media Flow Threatens To Conquer The Past,
 All Tradition Molded In A New Form.<P>

 The Net Is Everywhere -
 And We Wander It`s Threads To An Unknown End -
 Transcending Our Dreams To Another Plane.<P>

 Secluded Dreams, Hidden Dreams,
 Where All Is Perversion, Diversion.
 Secluded Dreams, Hidden Dreams,
 It`s All Money, The God Money, Relentless Greed.<P>

 And The Loneliness Grows As People Shut Their Doors,
 For The Luring Light - The Flickering Screen.
 Addicted To Realms Designed To Dull Our Minds,
 And Dominate - As All Can See.</h3><P>

 <b><h2>Dream Theater - 6:00</b></h2><P>

 <h3>Six O` Clock And The Siren Kicks Him From A Dream,
 Tries To Shake It Off But It Just Won`t Stop.
 Can`t Find The Strenght But He`s Got Promises To Keep,
 And Wood To Choop Before He Sleeps.<P>

 I May Never Get Over - But Never`s Beter Than Now,
 I`ve Got Bases To Cover.<P>

 He`s In The Parking Lot,
 Just Sitting In His Car.
 He Lights A Cigarette,
 And Turns The Music Down.
 But Just Can`t Seem To Shake That Sound...<P>

 Once I Thought I`d Get Over - But It`s Too Late For Me Now,
 I`ve Got Bases To Cover !<P>

 Melody Walks Through The Door,
 And Memory Flies Through The Window.
 Nobody Knows What They Want,
 `Til They Finally Let It All Go.<P>

 The Pain Inside - Coming Outside...<P>

 So many Ways To Drown A Man, So Many Ways To Drag Him Down,
 Some Are Fast And Some Take Years And Years.
 Can`t Hear What He`s Saying When He`s Talking In His Sleep,
 Finally Find The Sound But He`s In Too Deep.<P>

 I Could Never Get Over - Is It Too Late For Me Now ?
 Feel Like Blowing My Cover !<P>

 But Don`t Cut Your Losses Too Soon,
 `Cause You`ll Only Be Cutting Your Throat.
 And Answer A Call While You Still Hear It All,
 `Cause Nobody Will If You Won`t.</h3><P>

 <b><h2>Helloween - The Dark Ride</h2></b><P>

 <h3>( All Aboard - Step Right This Way,
 The Dark Ride Is Leaving Soon.
 Just Sign Your Name On The Dotted Line,
 All I Want Is Just Your Soul.
 Tighten Your Belt - And Let`s Go... )<P>

 Standing In Line To Get Into The Fairground,
 Heading To The Wicked Side.
 One Way Ticket, There Is No Returning,
 Leave Your Soul At The Gates.<P>

 ( Out Of Doubt - No Hope - Satan feeds Our Madness... )
 ...Insanity Confirms Where We Stand !
 ( Spit The Red Vile Breath - And Wrath Is Our Gift... )

 Slowly Creeping Up, Quickly Coming Down.
 Take A Spin On The Dark Ride,

 ( Driven To Our Final Fate - Jump Out Of This Game. )
 Can We Ever Stop This Ride To Hell ?<P>

 Is There Any Wonder - Why We Came About ?
 Was It For Love - Or To Let Sin Abound ?
 Isn`t It A Wonder - Awake From Blood Thick Dreams ?
 Remove All The Stones From Our Hearts - We Must All Believe !<P>

 Will We Find A Way To The Other Side ? Heading For A Light.
 Who Is Holding The Key ? Why We Can`t See ?<P>

 ( I Force The Engine Of Your Deadly Sins,
   Even Through The Darkest Phase - Be It Thick Or Thin.
   I`m Your Pain When You Can`t Feel,
   I Know Too Well You`ll Follow Me... )</h3><p>
