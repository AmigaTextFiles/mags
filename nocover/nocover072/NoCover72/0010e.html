<H1><B>1990-93`s Edition</H1></B>
<P> The fabulous political-strategy game, described by
 Amiga-Joker with "HOCHPROZENTIG" (potent).
 Needs 1 MB RAM. Demoversion available !</P>
<P> 1990-93`s Edition is a fascinating strategy game,
 in which you have to try to advance from being the founder of
 a political party to become elected prime minister.
 But beware! Faster then you might think, the party life may be over,
 bankruptcy may threaten you.
 Construct your own party policies,
 conduct speaches, visit talkshows, 
 try to influence the media.</P>
<P> Do you aim to be supported by big business or
 do you put your emphasis on occupation of different positions, i.e.
 as national Greenpeace-chairman, as minister for the interior,
 becoming a state premier or the president of the federal bank.?
 But there are also election events to be conducted, and pity you,
 if you don't adjust your speeches to the current 
 affairs and local problems!
 (pollution, unemployment ect.).</P>
<P> 1990 - The 93`s edition contains realistic data from all
 16 federal states as well as the then political surrounds.
 All names are authentic too.
 1990-93`s edition is a worthy sequel to the
 92`s edition. Of course there are many improvements since!!
 The graphics were polished up dramatically and there are also 
 some new very good sounds.
 And without question the 1990-93`s edition also runs on an A 1200
 as well as every other Amiga model.
 1990-93`s edition is available for Amiga & PC !</P>
<P> The Amiga-version requires at least 1 MB Ram and
 supports 2 disk drives or a hard drive.<P>
