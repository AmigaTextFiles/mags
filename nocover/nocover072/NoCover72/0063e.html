Amiga Times - the entertainment magazine

<P>After lenghty deliberations we have decided to publish a CD-Rom. With this,
our first CD, we are starting a trial, which, if successful, may lead to further
projects of this kind. To make this CD not only interesting for our confirmed
Amiga Times readers we spared no effort to present a first rate product to you
all. Thanks to the cooperation of many firms and individual programmers this
was deemed a success and we can present you with a full version with numerous
Modules, graphics, tools, text documents, demos, shareware, programs and games,
as well as all published Amiga Times in html and guide format (inclusive 2
director's cut versions) - certainly an interesting proposition for fans of
magazines. This will complete your collection of our publicized mags for the
time being.

<BR>
The Amiga Times CD totals a file size of more than 620 MB.
