To be on holidays all year round - nice to imagine indeed. But what happens,
if you can't go on holidays yourself but have to provide them for others ?
Instead of having fun you might experience stress in what should be the best
time of the year. And to be able to go to Hawaii and live in the sunshine in
retirement can be a stony path for you. A path of wrong decisions,
unfortunate chance happenings, customers staying away; but also success,
fully booked accomodations and a fat wallet and bank account.

<P>
But you and your level of business sense are ultimately responsible for
your success. As a junior businessman with a rather limited starting
capital you can't afford too many bad decisions. Starting with your choice
of real estate, the kind of buildings you put on, the internal decorations
and choosing pricing levels you must not make mistakes. But even when the
holidaymakers stay away from your rental accomodations, you have other
ways of income. There are your hotdog stands, papershops and icecream
parlors along the white, sandy beaches. But here too you have to provide
the stock and logistics, so the sales will not slow down. And again your
sense of pricing must be competitive. You have more assets: You buy small
lakes and offer angling licences. This too is a busy job: pricing policy,
attracting customers and constantly looking after your fishing stock is
important, because without fish there are no anglers.

<P>
So you see, you have both hands full to satisfy your customers and to keep
your bank account in the black. But it is not only your bad decision
making, which can drive you into financial ruin. Break-ins, housefires, and
bad weather conditions can cut deep holes into your budget. Someone
who has no insurance in these circumstances is soon made to look real
silly. But smaller defects in houses sum up too and, if not attended to,
can bring you to your knees.

<P>
And if you're still not fully challenged, you can aquire a small pet. It
needs constant looking after, feeding and compassion.
It is not an easy task then, to "make" holidays for others - are you the
right entrepreneur for 365 holi-days per year...? Try it out ...
