<H1><b>NoCover</H1></B>
<P> NoCover, the Club-Diskmagazine edition
 for the Amiga. Includes postage within Germany
 (2 Disks!!).</P>
<P> Hot tests, workshops, discussions and much
 more are presented in this disk mag . This is not one of the
 usual "Scene-Mags". No testing of pirated software takes place here,
 only originals. And PD-Soft is not neglected either.
 On the contrary !
 You won't find as much information about PD-Soft in any other 
 magazine. Even commercial magazines can't match our up-to-date reports.
 And how could they ? After all we are one of the first to
 get our hands on PD software.
 NoCover also deals regularly with DFÜ items.</P>
<P> Here anyone can air their frustrations, which they might have
 accumalated in dealing with some shop or dealer.
 Everyone can write in !
 Simply send your text on disk to NoCover or
 upload into our mailbox !
 And it does not matter, what topic you choose, as long as it is
 presentable.
 So, what do you say ? Have you sent anything off yet ?
 Get your fingers cracking !</P>
<P>  NoCover is published regularly on every 1st of the month.
 The NoCover mag requires at least 1 MB ChipRam und
 Amiga-OS 2.x.  Recommended are Amiga-OS 3.x, 2 MB RAM as well as a
 hard disk.</P>
