Thet is also an important source of the element Trillium.</P>

searching for other sentinet lifeform in the universe the first chance for
contact with another sentinet lifeform. But if they knew what will happen in
in the year 2762, they had hoped to be alone in universe.</P>

<P>The Alien Ship stoped far away form Thet, giant laserbeams were fired
at the planet, one single Schot had giant dimensions. The planet was
completly destroyed by the alien ship. This was the year 2762, the begin of the
war against the Cin`zao.</P>
