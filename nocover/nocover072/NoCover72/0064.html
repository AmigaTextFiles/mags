    Inside you will find some of the best Magor Demos  that were ever made on
the Amiga.  This selection has been made from over 7000 disks worth of stuff. 
(and all 7000 are available).  You'll see demos from 1988 and up including
1998.  The way this collection is set out is that you can expirence the best
demos of each year.  This CD comes with a easy-to-use index, where you it is
easy to find what you are looking for.  

<P>    System Requirements: As most demos inside run from CD, you'll need a CD
Rom, and you should have AT LEAST the following specs:-  AGA, and over 8 meg
of FAST RAM.
