    Here you'll find some of the best Magor Demos that were ever made on
the Amiga.  This selection has been made from over 7000 disks full of stuff.
(and all 7000 are available).  You'll see demos from 1988 and up including
1998.  The way this collection is set out is that you can experience the best
demos of each year.  This CD comes with an easy-to-use index, where it is
a breeze to find what you are looking for.

<P>    System Requirements: As most demos run from CD, you'll need a CD
Rom, and you should have AT LEAST the following specs:-  AGA, and over 8 meg
of FAST RAM.
