DESCRIPTION

   So what is Wingnuts? Well, bluntly stated, Wingnuts is the most
   popular combative sport watched and played on the planet of Holy
   Doobie. Each week millions of fanatical fans tune in to watch as
   the six pilots are strapped into their heavily armed
   contraptions, cheering thunderously as they take off into the
   arena and fly their dance of homicidal death. Their objective is
   brutally straight-forward - destroy the opposition and remain the
   last pilot in the air.
