DESCRIPTION


want to be sure that you have done all you can to prevent piracy?
Software piracy is a pain in the programmers neck, but now there is a
system that makes it easy on the programmer and hard on the pirate:
SecureKey.

  In the SecureKey system you get the benefits from well-known,
modern-day cryptography techniques without spending weeks or even
months of studying a lot of boring mathematics.

  But that's not all: SecureKey also provides easy generation and
handling of the keyfiles by using the KeyGen program. Using the ARexx
port makes it easy to connect KeyGen (the keyfile generation program)
to any database program for automatic keyfile generation. A sample
ARexx script is included in the package that connects the shareware
database <a href="fiasco.html">Fiasco</a> to KeyGen.

  Also included in the SecureKey system is a datatype with which
anyone can view the contents of a SecureKey keyfile without being able
to create a fake key, thanks to the special properties of the
well-known RSA encryption algorithm. This makes easy to identify who
the keyfile belongs to and to which program it is meant for.

  The SecureKey keyfiles are authenticated with the MD5 checksum
algorithm, which is known as one of the most secure authentication
algorithms.

  The SecureKey keyfiles are also prepared for future Amigas by
containing a separate field for a Hardware Serial number. Hardware
serial numbers are not present in today's Amiga's, but they might be
in the future.

REQUIREMENTS

   * All Amigas with AmigaOS 2.04 (V37) or higher. The SecureKey
     datatype requires AmigaOS 3.0 (V39).
   * 68000 processor, 68020 highly recommended though.
   * MUI 3.5 (not included)
   * PGP 2.6 or higher (not included)
   * About 500 Kb RAM (MUI uses a lot of RAM).

AVAILABILITY

   SecureKey can be downloaded from:

   * <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~crush/securekey/SecureKey.lha">http://www.lysator.liu.se/~crush/securekey/SecureKey.lha</a>
   * <a href="ftp://ftp.luth.se/pub/aminet/dev/misc/SecureKey.lha">ftp://ftp.luth.se/pub/aminet/dev/misc/SecureKey.lha</a> (102503)
     or any other Aminet site.

CONTENTS

   In the SecureKey package you will find:

   * KeyGen - the keyfile generation program
   * SecureKey.datatype - for examining SecureKey keyfiles
   * Full documentation - extensive and easy to follow.
   * Decoding sources - with easy instructions of how to recreate the
                        decryption routines (because they are illegal
                        to export in binary or source form).

PRICE

   SecureKey is SHAREWARE!

   The shareware fee is

   * 15 UKP
   * 20 USD
   * 30 DM
   * 120 FIM
   * 160 SEK

RESTRICTIONS

   In the unregistered version all generated keyfiles will be of type
'Demo' and the serial number and application ID 0 is always 0.
