DESCRIPTION

 AmiComSys or Amiga Communicator System is a new Internet application
 for the Amiga OS.

 The alone days on the net have gone. With AmiComSys you always will have
 company while you are surfing.

 You can see if your Amiga buddies are online, or why not find new
 friends?

 With the people online you can exchange messages, which pops up on the
 screen. If you prefer to chat private with one of your friends, that's
 also possible, with the nice private chat feature, PChat.

 If you want to chat more public, there's a public chat room, HotLine.

 You can also send files to your friends, with the SendFile feature.

 So you can keep track of your friends AmiComSys also includes a
 friends book, where you can enter name, email and comments. The
 friends book is also used with the feature which allows you to hide
 people logged in to server, which are not your friends. If you don't
 want to hide others, you can configure the program to highlight your
 friends in the client list.

 The graphical interface is fully configurable like every other MUI
 (Magic User Interface) program.

 As of version 1.17b the feature list looks like this:

 Send text messages.
 Shows a client list with all people logged in.
 Send Web- or Chat-requests. i.e homepage addresses and IRC channels
 A message history buffer, which saves all the received messages.
 Auto saving of the history buffer.
 Logging.
 A versatile ARexx interface.
 File transfer.

 A friends book.
 Show all, highlight friends, or show only friends.
