Nova Design, Inc., producers of the award winning ImageFX package and the 
highly received Aladdin 4D package, are proud to announce the exciting 
version 3.2 upgrade to ImageFX! ImageFX has been the required graphics 
application for all Amiga owners and has been a part of Video Toaster/Flyer 
owner's toolkits for years. Combining painting, image file format 
conversion, image processing, and special effects, ImageFX is the 
undisputed leader in graphics manipulation on the Amiga.

When ImageFX 3.0 was released, it brought the first implementation of real 
image layers compositing technology to the Amiga. This came with a vastly 
enhanced user interface, larger previews, multiple image windows, faster 
redraws, and child menus. Photoshop file format import and exporting was 
added and the ability to work directly with color-mapped (CMAP) images! 
ImageFX, true to its name, also added new effects such as Pagecurler, 
plasma Clouds, particle pixel Scatter, image Splash, and the amazing 
FXForge for creating hundreds of new effects.

Highlights of the new ImageFX

The newest release of ImageFX is version 3.2. This release has virtually
eliminated any reported problems experienced by users in previous releases 
and has added many new features as well.

The new features include support for more BMP and JPEG image file 
subformats, support for images saved from the Brilliance paint program, and 
minor updates to the IMP batch processor for ImageFX. Many new Arexx 
commands have been added as well, a new control has been added to the Layer 
Manager, and for owners of pressure sensitive drawing tablets ImageFX now 
supports pressure in the airbrush painting tool. Major work was also done 
to enhance the operation of ImageFX's region masks as well!

Support for older Hewlett Packard SCSI Scanjet models was added along with 
many overall enhancements to this module, which include better previews. 
The Epson scanner module has been improved, but development of support for 
the Epson Perfection 600 model was dropped when Epson discontinued this 
model.
