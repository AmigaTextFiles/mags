The CD Games Attack Volume 1 is fully dedicated to the subject of games.
From the simple PacMan clone up to the costly action game something for every taste is included. Also everything for the happy game is included: HD installers, degrade tools, cheat-collections and all needed system data like gfx-board software.
But thats not all! Also you find Demoversions of the newest Amiga Top games and save-games, too. Everything is completly installed and just waits for your exploration!
