17. Neue Soundkarte f&uuml;r den A1200-Uhrenport angek&uuml;ndigt

&raquo;ANNOUNCE: DELFINA 1200 - NEW DSP AUDIO CARD FOR AMIGA 1200

 1. TECH

Delfina 1200 is based on Delfina Lite, the most successful DSP card on 
Zorro-II Amigas. The main difference between these two is that Delfina 1200 
connects to the internal clock port of A1200. This way the PCMCIA and 
expansion slots can be used for other devices. The modern manufacturing 
allows a very low price: SRP is $299.

Delfina 1200 is primarily a DSP audio card, and it is best suited for 
producing and recording audio with optional realtime effects. Effects can 
be applied on any sound produced by Delfina or external source 
transparently, and all the sounds produced by Delfina-capable programs or 
external source can be mixed into Delfina's output. Delfina 1200 is also 
freely programmable for all general computing tasks using the supplied 
compiler and libraries.

Features:

 * 37 MHz Motorola DSP56002 digital signal processor

  &raquo; 18.5 MIPS, upto 110 MOPS
  &raquo; 24 bit data bus (144 dB dynamic range)

 * 96kB (32kWords) SRAM

  &raquo; Zero-waitstate (12ns)

 * Stereo audio codec (Crystal CS4231A)

  &raquo; Sample frequencies upto 48 kHz at 16 bit
  &raquo; Three stereo inputs, one stereo output
  &raquo; All inputs can be mixed with Delfina's output
  &raquo; Full duplex recording and playback
  &raquo; One stereo RCA input
  &raquo; One stereo 3.5mm input with optional 20dB mic amplifier
  &raquo; One stereo RCA output
  &raquo; Internal connector for audio input from CD-ROM
  &raquo; Fully programmable using the supplied software
  &raquo; Registered version of SoundFX 3.50 software included

Requirements:

 * Amiga 1200 with an empty clock port
 * AmigaOS 2.04 or higher
 * about 5MB of hard disk space

 2. SUPPORT

Delfina 1200 fully supports AHI, the retargetable audio standard for Amiga.
Number of AHI supporting programs is steadily increasing. Delfina also has 
emulation for the Toccata card.

In addition to AHI standard, Delfina 1200 can run multiple Delfina and AHI 
programs at the same time, and various effects can be applied to any 
program's output. If multiple programs are producing sound, Delfina will 
mix the outputs.
Only Delfina's DSP usage and internal memory set the limits.

Software supporting Delfina includes:

 * Octamed SoundStudio
 * AudioLab16 for Delfina
 * SoundFX
 * Digi Booster Pro
 * Hippoplayer
 * APlayer
 * SinED
 * Play 16
 * ShapeShifter
 * Fusion
 * and many more.

Delfina 1200 system software includes:

 * AHI (Audio Hardware Interface) driver

  &raquo; Play&reg; multiple channel audio
  &raquo; AHI standard allows you to write software that works on other audio     
    boards or normal Amiga audio too

 * delfina.library

  &raquo; For basic operations and user's own DSP software
  &raquo; Supports DSP program multitasking
  &raquo; Enables audio playback and recording
