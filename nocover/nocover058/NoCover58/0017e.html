<P> Marblelous is a new game from the house of APC & TCP.
 A captivating game, which is highly addictive.
 In this game you control a ball, with which you have to collect various
 power items, before you finally
 reach your goal.</P>
<P> But all is not as easy as it seems,
 because you don't steer the ball directly, 
 but have to erect roadsigns, which will 
 affect it's path. Just look at the demoversion
 and you will come to the same conclusion as we have: 
 The game is simply gigantic!<BR>
 Marblelous has 100 levels btw.</P>
