<p><b> Please introduce yourself to the readers!</b><br>

My name is Jakub Brzezniak, I'm 18 years old and live in Poland. </p>

<p><b>When did you start working with the Amiga?</b><br>

It was about 10 years ago but I can't remember exactly. </p>

<p><b>Which Amiga model do you own</b><br>

I used to own Amiga 1200/030 but now I use PC with WinUAE. </p>

<p><b>Which version of the operating system is running on your
computer?</b><br>

Still Workbench 3.1 </p>

<p><b>Which software are you developing?</b><br>

Currently I'm working on Magic Numbers 2 (but this will be avalaible only
for PC) and after finishing it I'm going to improve Swapper a bit (mainly
computer intelligence). </p>

<p><b>Can you tell us what your software is about?</b><br>

It's a mind game for 1-4 players similar to "Ooze". </p>

<p><b>What has created the idea in you to continue developing your
software?</b><br>

I guess that, as usual, a need to make it better :). </p>

<p><b>How long has the development taken so far?</b><br>

Quite long... </p>

<p><b>Which software are you using for developing?</b><br>

GoldED and SAS C. </p>

<p><b>For which system (AmigaOS, AmigaDE, MorphOS) are you
developing?</b><br>

AmigaOS. </p>

<p><b>Which OS will you support in the future?</b><br>

Swapper is propably my last program for Amiga (at least for Classic Amiga).
My next programs will be avalaible only for PC. </p>
 
<p><b>What can we expect of future versions?</b><br>

As I said, mainly better CPU intelligence, and maybe some other small
improvements. </p>

<p><b>Don't you lose the fun and the interest in programming if you see the
small amount of feedback you get from the small Amiga market?</b><br>

Well, I do. Nothing makes you feel better and willing to work then emails
from happy users :). And nothing makes you feel worse then when you don't
know if there are any people who use your programs... </p>

<p><b>Do you receive enough feedback for your software?</b><br>

Rather not. </p>

<p><b>When did you last use your Amiga?</b><br>

About few days ago. I don't use it too often recently cause as I said I'm
working on a PC game. </p>

<p><b>Which software did you last buy for your Amiga?</b><br>

As I remember Aminet Set 10. </p>

<p><b>Which software do you still use?</b><br>

Mainly Golded and SAS C for the development. I also play some freeware
games from time to time. </p>

<p><b>Which hard/software are you planning to buy?</b><br>

Currently none. </p>

<p><b>Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?</b><br>

Not as a completly new computer. I think it might come back as a new system
for already existing computers (I'm sure there would be a lot of people who
would like to try it, and not only old Amiga users) but since Amiga owners
don't want to go this way - I really don't think it has a big change. But,
who knows... </p>

<p><b>Your final words for the readers?</b><br>

  Send me more emails if you like my game :))). Bye.  </p>
