&raquo;TITLE

    Games Master System
    (GMS)

VERSION

    1.0 (Released May 1998)

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

    The Games Master System is a developers kit that is aimed at
    enhancing the functionality of the Amiga OS, with emphasis on games
    programming.  It is based on the Amiga shared library standard,
    so will work with any programming language such as C, Assembler,
    E, Basic etc.

    The system can be ported across to other platforms besides the
    Amiga, and in future GMS programs could be run on other platforms
    without recompilation (CPU's must match or they have to be
    emulated).

    Here are just a few of the features:

      - Object Oriented kernel design.
      - Fast blitter functions, including CPU assisted blitting.
      - In-built proportional fading functions.
      - Sound support, includes intelligent channel play-back.
      - Support for raster/copperlists with built-in special FX.
      - Automatic XPK decompression.
      - External structure and object pre-processing, allows user
        editing of program data.
      - Support for automatic picture remapping and resizing features.
      - Screen support includes double/triple buffering, and
        invisible chunky emulation.
      - Full resource tracking.
      - Support for all kinds of input devices (joysticks, joypads etc)
      - An official system debugger is provided.
      - A user preference program that allows editing of things such as
        default screen dimensions, resolutions, mode promotion etc.
      - Multi-tasking and screen-switching is supported.

    The system has a very modern design and includes full resource
    tracking and safe task destruction features.  The debugger is
    incorporated into the system itself, so there is no need for
    special patches or debugging tools.  Functions are written
    with garbage protection features and where possible, software
    based memory protection.  GMS can recover from many programming
    errors that usually result in software failures.

    Full documentation and over 70 demo sources in C, Assembler and
    E are included within the developer archive.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    A full installation will take up 2 megs of space on your hard
    drive.  KingCON or any other enhanced shell with a scroll back
    buffer is desirable for running IceBreaker.

    Support is given for E, SAS/C, StormC, DiceC, DevPac and PhxAss.

AVAILABILITY

    GMS is available on all up to date Aminet sites, for example:

      <a href="ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_dev.lha">ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_dev.lha</a> (590k)
      <a href="ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_user.lha">ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_user.lha</a> (240k)

    Developers will need both archives, Users will only need the second
    archive.

PRICE

    Developers are required to pay a license fee when a game is released.
    Costs start at $20US for shareware games.  Freeware developers do not
    have to pay this fee.

    an unrestricted version of GMSPrefs, access to e-mailed updates,
    bug fixes and so on.  The cost is $20US, and the registration will
    last for 2 years.
