<b> FPU: (De-)Normalization </b>

The PPC FPU also can handle denormalized numbers. A denormalized number is a number,
which has an exponent of 0, and a significand &#060;&#062; 0. This can happen after a very
small result appeared.

With the Precision of
Doubles this normally should not happen, especially as it normally does not make sense
to add very big and very small numbers together, in this way. But well, in case it
happens the PPC is able to handle these numbers too (the 060 was not able to handle
them, BTW, on the 060 the 68060.library had to provide emulation code for this).
