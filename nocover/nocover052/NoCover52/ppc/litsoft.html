<b> Literature and Software </b>

I recommend the following literature:

- PowerPC Microprocessor family : The Programming Environment

  This book is available as book and as PDF File. The PDF File is found on the
  Motorola Site <a href="http://www.mot.com,">http://www.mot.com,</a> and it is quite big (several MB). You can
  display PDF Files on your Amiga with xpdf 0.7, this program can also convert
  them to Postscript. You can print Postscript files with Ghostscript. Alternatively
  you can convert PDF Files to ASCII with pdftotxt (but you lose the correct
  display of all tables then...). In PDF, the document is &#062;800 pages. I wrote
  this tutorial mainly to have a quick reference as replacement for this PDF
  File. xdpf is soooooo slow.

- PowerPC 603/603E/604 User Manuals

  Might be interesting for some special knowledge also. Also available
  as books and as PDF File on <a href="http://www.mot.com.">http://www.mot.com.</a> Also quite big.
  There is some stuff found about Optimizing in these manuals.

- Optimizing PowerPC Code (Addison Wesley)

  This is mainly about Optimizing PowerPC ASM Code.

- The documentation of WarpOS and StormPowerASM, from which i also
  took some of the examples in this document.

I Recommend the following software:

- WarpOS

  This is a PowerPC Native Kernel compatible to the AmigaDOS, done by
  Haage&amp;Partner. It exists in two versions: One of the versions (V7.0)
  is compatible to Phase 5's Kernel (but it has also the disadvantages
  of Phase 5's Kernel), the other
  version (V12+, currently V13.11 is the most recent version)
  provides several advantages. Well, version 7 is not really a kernel,
  to tell the truth, it is just a wrap-around around Phase 5s kernel, only Version 8+
  is a real kernel. Quite some features only exist for version 8+.

  WarpOS is downloadable from <a href="ftp://ftp.haage-partner.com/WarpUP.">ftp://ftp.haage-partner.com/WarpUP.</a> Actually
  there are two archives found there, the base V12 Archive (with also the
  V7 executables) and an Update to V12.2 which fixes a bug in the initial
  release that caused a slowdown in memory access (a register was set
  incorrect).

- StormPowerASM

  The current only serious PowerPC ASM on Amiga. It is very good. If you
  know the 68k ASM PhxAss, you will get used to StormPowerASM soon. It
  is very similar, in certain ways. It needs WarpOS to be installed.

  Theoretically there is also GAS for the Phase 5 Software, but GAS was
  never meant to be a user-level Assembler. It was only meant to translate
  the output of GNU C. Also i have to note: All the things about Contextswitch,
  function design, Mixed/Fat Binary... in this document only apply to
  using StormPowerASM and WarpOS. Many of the commands explained above are
  not Standard PPC ASM, but StormPowerASM Macros.

- rtgmaster.library PPC

  In case you want to code demos/games with the PPC, this will be interesting
  for you. It is a system to produce Video-Hardware-Independent code. The
  especially interesting about it is, that you get all Video Refresh functions
  PPC Native, so that you do not need to do a Contextswitch for Video Refresh.
  There is not yet a public release, but in case you need it, you can get the
  current executable by asking me for it (<a href="mailto:MagicSN@Birdland.es.bawue.de">MagicSN@Birdland.es.bawue.de</a>). I hope
  to release the first version of rtgmaster.library PPC soon. rtgmaster.library PPC
  of course will be API-compatible to the 68k version.
