<b> Load/Store Commands </b>

lfs   Fd,d16(Ra)
lfsx  Fd,Ra,Rb
lfsu  Fd,d16(Ra)
lfsux Fd,Ra,Rb
lfd   Fd,d16(Ra)
lfdx  Fd,Ra,Rb
lfdu  Fd,d16(Ra)
lfdux Fd,Ra,Rb

These are the commands to load data from memory to a Floating Point Register. The
Data is interpreted as in Floating Point Format. In case of lfs* it is interpreted
as Single Precision, in case of lfd* as Double Precision.

lfs/lfd are the &quot;normal&quot; Load-Commands, which load the EA=Ra+d16 (or d16+0, if a=0).
lfsx/lfdx use (Ra|0)+Rb as EA instead. (&quot;Indexed&quot;).
The versions with u added are &quot;with Update&quot;, which means that Ra+d16 or Ra+Rb is
written back to Ra at the end. r0 is not allowed as Ra for the versions &quot;with Update&quot;.

stfs   Fs,d16(Ra)
stfsx  Fs,Ra,Rb
stfsu  Fs,d16(Ra)
stfsux Fs,Ra,Rb
stfd   Fs,d16(Ra)
stfdx  Fs,Ra,Rb
stfdu  Fs,d16(Ra)
stfdux Fs,Ra,Rb

These are the commands to store data from a Floating Point Register to memory.
The Data is stored in Floating Point Format. In case of stfs* it is written
in Single Precision Format to the Memory, in case of stfd* in Double Precision Format.

stfs/stfd are the &quot;normal&quot; Store-Commands, which store to the EA=Ra+d16 (or d16+0, if a=0).
stfsx/stfdx use (Ra|0)+Rb as EA instead. (&quot;Indexed&quot;).
The versions with u added are &quot;with Update&quot;, which means that Ra+d16 or Ra+Rb is
written back to Ra at the end. r0 is not allowed as Ra for the versions &quot;with Update&quot;.

Doubles take 64 Bit space in memory, Singles take 32 Bit.

stfiwx Fs,Ra,Rb

This command uses an EA of (Ra|0)+Rb. The Contents of the low-order 32-Bits of Fs
are stored into the word given by the EA, without any conversion.
