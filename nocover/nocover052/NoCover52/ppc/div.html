<b> Divisions </b>

divw  Rt,Ra,Rb
divd  Rt,Ra,Rb
divwu Rt,Ra,Rb
divdu Rt,Ra,Rb

divw: Divides signed parameters Ra:Rb and puts the result into Rt. The
Dividend is the 64 Bit Sign-Extended version of the 32 Bit Low-word of
Ra, the divisor simply is the 32 Bit Low-word of Rb. The result is put into
the Low-Word of Rt, the High-Word is undefined. No remainder will be
calculated.

divd: Divides signed parameters Ra:Rb and puts the result into Rt.
The Dividend is the 64 Bit Doubleword Ra, the divisor the 64 Bit
Doubleword Rb. The result is also 64 Bit. No remainder will be calculated.
Only exists on 64 Bit implementations.

divwu+divdu: Unsigned versions of divw and divd. divdu only exists on
64 Bit implementations.

If you need the remainder, you have to calculate it yourselves.

The division commands support both the . and the o Notation, like specified
in <a href="imp.html">Important things</a>.

Note: Divisions by 2^n can be quickly done, by combining a Shift Right
Algebraic and a addze instruction (adding the Carry-Flag to the Shifted
Result). The Shift-Command already sets the Carry correctly.
