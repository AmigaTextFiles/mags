<b> FPU Rounding+Conversion </b>

frsp Fd,Fb

This command rounds Fb to single-precision using the rounding mode specified in
FPSCR[RN] and puts the result into Rd.

fcfid Fd,Fb

The 64 Bit Signed Integer in Fb is converted to a Double using rounding mode
FPSCR[RN]. The result is put into Fd. This command only exists on 64 Bit
Implementations.

fctid Fd,Fb

The Double in Fb is converted to a 64 Bit Signed Integer using rounding mode
FPSCR[RN]. The result is put into Fd. This command only exists on 64 Bit
Implementations.

fctidz Fd,Fb

The same like fctid, only that always &quot;Round to 0&quot; is used. Only exists on 64
Bit Implementations.

fctiw Fd,Fb

The Floating-Point operand in Fb is converted to a 32 Bit Signed Integer, using
rounding mode FPSCR[RN]. It is placed in the low-order 32 Bits of Fd. Bits 0-31
of Fd are undefined.

fctiwz Fd,Fb

The same like fctiw, only that always rounding mode &quot;Round to 0&quot; is used.

All Rounding+Conversion functions support the . Notation like described in
<a href="imp.html">Important things</a>, but not the o Notation.
