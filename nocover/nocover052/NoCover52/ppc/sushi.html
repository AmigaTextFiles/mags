<b> Sushi </b>

Sushi is a nice utility for debugging purposes. You can download
it from Aminet. To use it, do:

setdb 3
sushi

Note, that setdb 3 opens the powerpc.library (setdb comes with your
version of StormPowerASM and sets the debug level). Also note, that
you can of course put the sushi output to a file, for example:

setdb 3
sushi &#062;work:sushi-log

You quit sushi/close the file by pressing CTRL-C.

Sushi logs for you all messages that are exchanged by Context-Switches
and such stuff. Usefull :)

If Enforcer is running, Sushi provides extra information.

Note, though, that running Sushi and debug level 3 will slow down things,
certainly.
