<b> Branch and Compare Commands</b>

The PPC defines it's branch commands in a rather abstract way. The full syntax
of the bc command for example looks like that:

bc BO,BI,target (bc 12,1,target would mean bgt target, for example)

where BO are special options like options to activate a dbra-like (dbra is a
well known 68k ASM command) function and BI is the condition code as an number.

A Compare would look like this:

cmpi BF,L,RA,SI or cmp BF,L,RA,RB or cmpli BF,L,RA,UI or cmp BF,L,RA,RB

Because of that i won't go into
detail for the abstract definition, but i will only specify the &quot;extended&quot;
commands which are much more easy to use. I do not want to completely handle
the PPC ASM, i only want to handle the things which make sense on the existing
Amiga-PowerPC-WarpUP system.
