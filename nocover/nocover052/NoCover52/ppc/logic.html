<b> Logic Commands</b>

andi  Ra,Rs,UI
andis Ra,Rs,UI
xori  Ra,Rs,UI
xoris Ra,Rs,UI
ori   Ra,Rs,UI
oris  Ra,Rs,UI

These commands perform logic operations with Integer-Variables.
The difference between the *i and *is versions is, that with the *is
the constant will be Shifted 16 Bit Left before the operation (This
solution is taken, as UI only can be 16 Bit, and it might be needed to
access all 32 Bit). The target is register Ra. andi and andis
also support the . notation, like outlined in <a href="imp.html">Important Things</a>.
UI is a 16 Bit constant.

and  Ra,Rs,Rb
xor  Ra,Rs,Rb
or   Ra,Rs,Rb
nand Ra,Rs,Rb
nor  Ra,Rs,Rb
eqv  Ra,Rs,Rb
andc Ra,Rs,Rb
orc  Ra,Rs,Rb

These are command to perform logic operations between Registers.
The target is register Ra. Eqv is the Complement of Xor, andc is
the Complement of and, orc is the Complement of or. All these commands
support the . notation.

mr Rx,Ry

This is an extended command, which is defined as or Rx,Ry,Ry and which
copies Register Ry to Register Rx.

not Rx,Ry

This is an extended command, which is defined as nor Rx,Ry,Ry, and which
negates Ry (to Rx).

nop

This is an extended command, which is defined as ori 0,0,0

Examples:

andis. r4,r5,r6
mr r8,r11
