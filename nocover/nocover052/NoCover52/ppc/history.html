<b> History </b>

1.0  First Version
1.1  Added Branch+Compare Commands, Logic Commands, Extension Commands,
     Multiple Load/Store Operations and Branch Prediction Optimizations.
     Added arithmetic commands (still incomplete, Mul/Div still missing).
     Some Bugfixes.
1.2  Bugfixed Arithmetic Commands, added Mul/Div commands, Some Bugfixes.
1.3  Added Stuff about Rotating/Shifting (Rotate_32 Commands might contain
     bugs, did not understand that completely myselves, yet), added information
     about relative/absolute branches, added condition-logic commands.
1.4  Added info about PowerOpen Standard and function-coding, added info
     about a lot of StormPowerASM macros, clearified use of the macro
     executable in &quot;A First Program&quot;
1.41 Fixed Small bug in stmw description and bug concerning 64 Bit operations
     (Read <a href="imp.html">Important Things</a>).
1.42 Fixed small bug in description of Extension Commands concerning
     32/64 Bit Implementations
1.5  Added information about calling functions from PPC Shared Libraries
     Added information concerning sushi
     Added information concerning Contextswitches (Synchrone and Asynchrone)
     Added information about Mixed/Fat Binary
1.6  Added extended commands for condition bit commands
     Added Special Register Access Commands
     Added Extended Commands for Shift/Rotate
     Added Multi Precision Shifts
     The Integer-Part is now complete, at least as to the functions that are
     interesting for programmers who do not want to code a new OS in PPC ASM.
     I also left out everything interrupt-concerning.
     I will do the FPU-Part next.
1.7  Started FPU Part
     Did not yet handle Normalization in Descriptions
2.0  With the Exception of the Optimizing Chapter the tutorial is done now.
     As to FPU Exceptions and Normalization i chose only to provide basic info
     which is interesting for the common programmer. In the - very unprobable -
     case you need more info about these themes, read in the Motorola Docs about
     it. I did not want to write this whole document about stuff the usual
     programmer does not need, anyways. This tutorial should help programmers
     to find an easy start... it should not replace the Motorola Docs as
     the &quot;complete docs to PPC where everything is found&quot;.
2.1  Fixed a lot of Bugs in the Documentation, and added some more info, thanks
     to Sam Jordan for reading the whole stuff and bug-reporting... :)
2.2  Fixed Bugs concerning Carry/Borrow and another silly bug in the 68k-&#062;PPC
     Porting section, used the highly Optimized Shift with Upper Word unchanged
     combination from Sam Jordan (the one i hacked in fast before the release
     of the last version had a bug).
2.3  Well, Sam found out, that the way he explained the Carry/Borrow Business
     to me was not completely correct. And i never used a subtract with Carry
     Command before in a PPC Source :) Well, now this document is really fixed
     and also describes the Subtract-With-Carry Stuff like it really works :)
