<b> Multiplications</b>

mulli   Rt,Ra,SI
mullw   Rt,Ra,Rb
mulld   Rt,Ra,Rb
mullhd  Rt,Ra,Rb
mullhdu Rt,Ra,Rb
mullhw  Rt,Ra,Rb
mullhwu Rt,Ra,Rb

These are the multiplication commands.

mulli:

32 Bit Implementations:

32*32 Bit =&#062; Low 32 Bit of the result.

64 Bit Implementations:

64*64 Bit =&#062; Low 64 Bit of the result. A full 128-Bit product can be
calculated with mulli and one of mulhd/mulhdu/mulhw/mulhwu.

mullw:

32*32 Bit =&#062; 64 Bit. The low-order parts of the parameters are used, only.
Together with mulhw/mulhwu a complete 64-Bit product can be calculated.
The low-order 32 Bits are the correct 32-Bit-Product for 32 Bit Implementations
and in 32 Bit Mode also for 64 Bit implementations.

mulld:

64*64 Bit =&#062; Low 64 Bit of the result. Only exists on 64 Bit implementations.

mullhw:

32*32 Bit =&#062; High 32 Bit of the result. The parameters are taken as signed
integer, here. The high 64-Bit of the result are placed into the LOW Word.
The HIGH word is undefined. This command can be used together with mulli/mullw
to calculate a full 128/64 Bit product.

mullhd:

64*64 Bit =&#062; High 64 Bits of the result. Asides from being 64 Bit, it works
the same like mullhw. This command only exists on 64 Bit Implementations.

mulhwu:

Unsigned Version of mullhw.

mulhdu:

Unsigned Version of mullhd. Only exists on 64 Bit Implementations.

mullw and mulld supports both the . and o notation, like defined in
<a href="imp.html">Important things</a>, mulli none of them, all other Multiplication
commands only the . notation.
