<b> A Quick Start </b>

As you all know, the Amiga was at it's end. There were no new
fast Amigas. But now Phase 5 built that great PowerUP Accelerators,
5-10 times faster than a 060.

The Problem: 68k ASM source won't run on them (at least not on the PPC part
of the Dual-Processor-System... on the 68k Part of course, it will run,
but it won't be faster than on any 68k Accelerator there). They are PowerPCs.
For application programmers this is no problem. They code in C, anyways.
But i decided to write this tutorial to help the game/demo coders to
adapt to the new platform. And i will tell you: When you coded a while
for the PPC in ASM, you won't miss the 68k !!!

About this document: I am assuming you are acknowledged with 68k ASM.
So i won't explain what dc.l is doing and such stuff... Thanks to Sam
Jordan, the Pseudo-Opcodes of the PPC ASM look very much like those of
the 68k ASM. I will concentrate on the PPC commands themselves.

I also assume you have WarpUP and StormPowerASM installed. If you do not
have it:

- WarpUP is available at: <a href="ftp://ftp.haage-partner.com/WarpUP/WarpUP.lha">ftp://ftp.haage-partner.com/WarpUP/WarpUP.lha</a>
- There is also an update on this site, which gives you the latest version
- StormPowerASM is a commercial PPC ASM by Haage&amp;Partner. In fact the
  only PPC ASM on Amiga currently. And it is great !!!

Just to make it once more clear. The coding conventions used here are
for WarpUP, not for ppc.library. Also StormPowerASM only runs together
with WarpUP. WarpUP is the better PPC Software, in my opinion, anyways.

This document is also mainly intended for 68k ASM coders, who want to port
some of their code to PPC or optimize it for PPC. As will be more detailed
described later, you don't need to port more than 10-20% of your code to
PPC ASM in most cases...
