<b> FPU Status and Control </b>

This section provides some commands to modify the FPSCR register (the
FPU Control register), or to check its data. With the exception of mcrfs,
all these commands support the . Notation like defined in
<a href="imp.html">Important things</a>. The o Notation is not supported, though.
Also have a look at <a href="fpscr.html">FPSCR and XER</a>.

mffs Fd

This command copies the contents of the FPSCR to the low-order of Fd.
The high-order is undefined.

mcrfs crfd,crfs

This command copies the contents of the FPSCR field crfd <a href="condf.html">Condition field Notation</a>
to the CR field crfD. All exception bits copied, with the exception of
FEX and VX, are deleted.

mtfsfi crfd,IMM

Copies the absolute value IMM to the Condition field crfd of FPSCR.
The contents of FPSCR[FX] are altered only, if crfd = 0.

mtfsf FM,Fb

The low-order of Fb is placed into the FPSCR, with the control of
the mask FM. The mask identifies the fields (numbered from 0-7) to
be affected, so it is a value between 0-127. The contents of FPSCR[FX]
are only altered, if FM[0]=1.

mtfsb0 crb

The FPSCR Bit Location specified is cleared. Does not work with FEX and VX.

mtfsb1 crb

The FPSCR Bit Location specified is set. Does not work with FEX and VX.
