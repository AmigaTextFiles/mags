<b> Normal Additions/Subtractions</b>

addi  Rt,Ra,SI
addis Rt,Ra,SI
add   Rt,Ra,Rb
subi  Rx,Ry,val
subis Rx,Ry,val
subf  Rt,Ra,Rb
sub   Rt,Ra,Rb

These commands do addition and substraction. In fact the substructions are
only extended commands defined by adding a negative value. the *i commands
are used to add/subtract (signed) integers, the *is for (signed) integers,
but the Constant is shifted 16 Bit Left before it is used - the constant itself
can only be 16 Bit, because of this the *i and *is versions are supported.
The plain add/sub is for adding/subtracting register values. These commands
use 16 Bit Integers as SI. The . and o Notation, like outlined in
<a href="imp.html">Important things</a> is valid with add, subf and sub, but not
for addi/addis/subi/subis. subf does Rt=Rb-Ra, sub does does Rt=Ra-Rb.

neg Rt,Ra

This negates Ra and saves the result into Rt. (2-Complement). The . and
o notations are both supported.

If Ra is the lowest possible number, 0x8000 0000 0000 0000 (or 0x8000 0000
in 32 Bit Implementations), Rt is set to this number, and if the o notation
was used, SO is set to 1.

There are some extended commands, defined by the above commands:

li Rx,val = addi Rx,0,val

(read the comments about this command in the section about the Load/Store
commands, where i put it, because i found it more fitting to be put there).

la Rx,Disp(Ry) = addi Rx,Ry,Disp

(Read the comments about this command also in the section about the Load/Store
commands, where i put it, because i found it more fitting to be put there).
