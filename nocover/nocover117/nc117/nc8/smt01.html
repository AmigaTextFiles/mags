Tja Leute, dieser Text stammt aus dem UUCP. Was man dvon halten soll, weiss
ich auch nicht... Er ist zwar auf Englisch, aber ich hoffe das bereitet
euch nicht all zu groﬂe Probleme :-)

&gt; Hello there,
&gt; some points of view and a few rumours.
&gt;
&gt; I've read that the a new baby is due out this autumn - called the A1400.
&gt; Sounds good!
&gt; yet another knife in the back for A600 and A1200 users? no, not really.
&gt;
&gt; Everyone was expecting a mid-range Amiga anyway...thats the A4000/030
&gt; job.&lt;and a very nice job it is too :) &gt;
&gt;
&gt; This A1400 is supposedly to run on a 28MHz `020 CPU .
&gt; This is believable because Commodore did mention to me that they would
&gt; probably upgrade it to a highr CPU one day.
&gt;
&gt; So now the interesting thoughts.
&gt; Release date of A1400   = Autumn `93
&gt; Release date of AMCD    = Autumn `93
&gt;

&gt; could this mean that the cd console would also be operating with a 28
&gt; MHz 020 ?? --It would REALLY be able to wipe the ground with the mega_CD
&gt; then wouldn't it!!? :P
&gt;
&gt; There is a follow up to all this of course.....
&gt; C= have been designing there MPEG board and DSP board for a little while
&gt; now.
&gt; I believe that it is possible that we see the following in the A1400
&gt; (reasonable)
&gt;
&gt; CPU = 28MHz 020
&gt; DSP = AT&amp;T3210  - replacable with AT&amp;T3070 in V.near future
&gt; SOUND = 16-bit 8 channel new ASA chip (named Julia possibly)
&gt; GRAPHICS = same old AGA chipset but with 4MEG CHIP addressable
&gt;   (old? :) )
&gt; SHAPE = This is the pizza box one!!!
&gt; PORTS = SCSI MIDI FLOPPY MODEM(due to DSP) SERIAL PARALLEL VIDEO TV COMP
&gt; etc
&gt;         + bonus of standard PCMCIA slot (the proper version)
&gt;
&gt; =========================================================================
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; Now the MISC bit,
&gt;
&gt; Interested in MPEG technology? well, before some rich smug gitt gets his
&gt; hands on a MPEG board to make you green with envy.....beat them to the
&gt; post.
&gt;
&gt; get a software MPEG decoder.
&gt; It is available from 17-Bit PD software under the guise of one of their
&gt; "LSD legal tools" disk.
&gt; The LSD disk number is out of my head right now, but i believe that it
&gt; is one of the 70's ones.
&gt;
&gt; Where to get the MPEG animations? Easy.
&gt;

&gt; FTP them from the following site:     toe.cs.berkeley.edu
&gt; via anonymous ftp (enter name as anonymous :) )
&gt; they are in the /pub/multimedia/mpeg/movies directory
&gt; some of them are amazing
&gt; they run at 14 fps on an A4000 - so watch out! (it is software based
&gt; after all)
&gt;
&gt; Now then...time to decide which 50MHz 030 card I'm gonna buy for my
&gt; A1200!
&gt;  - I'm a bit stuck.....got any recommendations anyone?
&gt;
