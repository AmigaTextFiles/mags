World-Lauch der NG-AMIGA SDK auf der Messe in Neuss:
<P>
Bill Mc Ewen hat es in seiner neuesten eMail bestätigt: AMIGA wird das
neue SDK (Software Development Kit) für die NG-AMIGAs weltweit erstmalig
auf der Messe in Neuss anbieten.
Bill selbst wird die SDK-Pakete für die lokal ausstelenden Händler dabei
haben. Der Preis beläuft sich voraussichtlich auf ca. 250,- DM.
<P>
Wie geplant wird Bill in einem Vortragsraum das neue System vorstellen,
von AMIGAs Zukunftsplänen berichten und den Fragen der Besucher Rede und
Antwort stehen.
<P>
Bill am Sonntag nur kurz dabei:
Da Bill am Montag ein sehr wichtiges Interview mit der NewYork-Times
hat, mußte er seine Besuchszeit auf den Samstag reduzieren. Wenn
überhaupt, dann ist Bill am Sonntag nur sehr kurz auf der Messe.
Besucher, die insbesondere der Vorträge wegen kommen, sollten die
Anfahrt auf Samstag vorverlegen. Das SDK wird selbstversändlich auch
Sonntag lieferbar sein.

AMIGA informiert:
<P>
<B>Executive Update: 6-3-2000</B>
<P>
Hello World:
<P>
Today is June 3, 2000, the six month anniversary of our first day of
operation as the proud new owners of Amiga.
<P>
When we got involved with Amiga, it was with the clear vision and goal that
we were going to change computing forever.
That we were going to be able to create an operating system that was
scalable and would run on different platforms and that hardware could
evolve as quickly as possible, and that Amiga would be able to take
advantage of that, and not be limited by it.
<P>
I wanted to create long term partnerships with our developers and OEMs
where we could truly be partners and not competitors.
That is being achieved by putting into practice logical, common sense
ideas, and working hard to succeed in achieving our goal.
<P>
After an interesting twisting of events, we are here and everything that is
mentioned above we have the chance to obtain.
<P>
Many of you did not think that we would make it this far :) , Suffice to
say we are going to be here for a long, long time.
It takes time to take over the world, we are planning to do it one customer
at a time, No, correct that, by adding one more member to the Amiga family
at a time.
<P>
As many of you already know, I sometimes get some depressing and rather
non-positive e-mails and recently I had one of those mornings where I was
inundated by hundreds of negative messages.
<P>
Someone in the community felt that they had been slighted, and they took
their grievance out into the public forum.
Personally, I was feeling rather down because no matter what I said or did
it would not be reactive, instead of pro-active.
It was with this heavy attitude that I attended an impromptu meeting with a
group of visiting Japanese consumer electronics companies.
<P>
I had never met them before, but they had heard what we were doing, and
they remembered the Amiga fondly.
After our presentation, one of the gentlemen sat back, and informed me that
what he had just heard, and saw was the most exciting opportunity that he
had seen in years, and that we were absolutely the correct company for
them to work with.
What they had not told us until after that, was that these three gentlemen
were actually representing a group of over 50 consumer electronics
companies, and they were looking for a long term partner!
Let's just say that they liked what they saw, and heard.
<P>
I left that meeting with a new attitude, Never Give Up, and Never
Surrender.
wait,.... I think that someone else may have borrowed that.
Ok, how about, I will no longer accept that I must apologize for Amiga and
neither should any of you we do not need to apologize for being better.
<P>
Now we may not always do things that way, the way that "others" may think
that we should and we may not always get it right the first time, but we
are moving forward with our plans, and we will win !!
<P>
If you have friends that used to come to your user group meetings, call
them.
If you have an extra Amiga not in use, please, do let a friend try one for
the first time. If you know places in your community where you can shine,
then do so.
<P>
The Amiga changed computing forever with the introduction of the A1000.
<P>
We are about to do it again.
<P>
Today we announce the release of the first product since our acquisition,
the Amiga Software Developers Kit. This is the first step in creating the
content, and applications that are going to change the way people look at
computing.
As many of you are aware, what we are talking about goes well beyond
turning on a computer, and waiting, waiting, waiting, oh " @%!%! ",
restart, waiting, waiting, and then start our frustrating tasks.
<P>
No what we are talking about here, is creating a new and exciting computing
environment, where you turn on your machine and guess what?......its on.
<P>
The environment embraces the user, as opposed to the user being forced into
a certain method of doing things. And all the while we stay true to Amiga.
As I have been told many times before, Amiga just did it right.
Now we will continue that pledge to you.
<P>
Make no mistakes this product is truly for developers. This is not for
people looking for the next version of the Amiga.
This is a developers kit, that provides the tools, and starts developers on
their education of writing VP code and Java.
<P>
This is designed as a reference platform to get started, and there will be
more releases of the SDK over the coming months, as we add new features
and expand the AmiVerse.
<P>
In case you have not noticed, this is a change from the announcement in St.
Louis on April 1, 2000. We had originally planned to release a hardware and
software only solution, but we received so many comments, and emails, that
we listened to you and decided to take the time and launched a software
version of the developer release. Yes we listened.
<P>
We also have changed our plans on the hardware portion of the announcement
also. We had planned to be the sole source for the dev-box, but within
hours of the St. Louis show we have numerous companies coming forth saying
that they could build the developer boxes for less.
So again, we listened and changed our plans.
<P>
We have gone with a regional approach now, and are finalizing the list of
Amiga Dev-Box companies authorized to sell an approved system.
<P>
These will be local companies in each of your areas, and this should also
help with support and warranty concerns.
<P>
Fleecy has been hard at work and has written an excellent document that
offers a glimpse into the SDK and the way that developers will be able to
get the most out of it in a short time.
<P>
You can read it in Amiga World, or in the developers support area of the
site.
<P>
For those of you who think that we are sitting around, please note the
following:
<P>
Currently there are over a quarter of a million lines of code written for
the new version of Boopsi.
<P>
We call it BOOPS. It is in testing, and in the optimization stage and it
shall be ready for release very soon.
<P>
Also we are working very hard on a new scripting language, very similar to
AREXX, that we know that everyone will be able to enjoy.
Portions are in test, and there will be more about this development in the
coming weeks also.
<P>
Also I am pleased to announce that Dean Brown has accepted our offer, and
will joining us full time, and is preparing to move his family to the
"great white north ", another positive move.
<P>
We also have some other talented folks, but I am not at liberty to tell you
their names until after the first week of July.
<P>
We are also making a special announcement with some friends at Java One
next week, and I think that you will all be pleased to see and read more
about that then.
<P>
I am also very excited about the new AmigaTainment section of the web site
being introduced this week.
This is where you will be able to see works in progress on Amiga titles.
These are all products being developed for the new Amiga OS, and will be
ready almost as fast as we will be.
<P>
For the Amiga dealers who have responded, and are planning on stocking the
new SDK, you will find their list in the dealer section of the web site.
Please support them, as they have continued to support Amiga.
<P>
We took over Amiga on January 3rd, 2000, and six months later we have
delivered on our promise to you, a new developer platform.
<P>
There will be more announcements and partnerships, changes to the web site
and developer updates over the coming months.
<P>
I know that our silence can be extremely frustrating and there are those
people who will try and take advantage of our silence, but I do not want
us to pre-announce and build false hope and expectations.
<P>
There was far too much of that activity in the past and we can no longer
afford to pay for those sins of the past. Let us all move forward
together.
<P>
So my friends, today I am 38 years old. It is my birthday, and I could find
no better way to celebrate with you than this. Well, actually there are a
couple, but it does not involve Amiga.
<P>
I thank God for what we have accomplished so far, but this is truly only a
small glimpse of what it to come, we have set even greater goals.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Bill McEwen, and the Amiga Team.

Es folgt die offizielle Ankündigung des Developerkits:
<P>
<B>Press Release</B>
<P>
Amiga is Back, and will change computing forever, again.
<P>
Amiga the creators of Multi-Media computing, have announced the release of
their developer kit for Amiga, Linux, and Java developers.
<P>
June 3, 2000 - Snoqualmie, WA - Amiga announces the release of the Amiga
Software Developers Kit, the first new product to introduce the next
generation Amiga platform.
  <P>
The Amiga Software Developers Kit provides the initial tools and examples
for developers to create exciting multi-media content for multiple devices
and computing environments. The unique strength of the New Amiga comes
from the partnership with the Tao Group in Reading England providing a
foundation where developers are able to take advantage of a ubiquitous
computing environment.
<P>
In 1984 Amiga established what is know today as multi-media.  As a result
of this, Amiga systems are used around the world by leading film studios,
animators, and in mission critical applications. Using this as the
foundation, the Amiga is moving forward by creating multi-media for
numerous devices and computing environments in the home, in the office and
beyond.
<p>
The Amiga OS is capable of being self-hosted, and sitting on top of other
operating systems. A single application is capable of running on X86,
Power PC, M.core, ARM, StrongArm, MIPs, SH3/4, and others.  In a hosted
environment the new Amiga runs on versions of Linux, Windows 95,98/NT,
Windows CE, OS/9, QNX4, and others to be announced.
<P>
The new OS also embraces the Java language in a new, powerful and compliant
way. The intent Java Technology Edition from Tao is world renowned for its
speed and compact execution of Java applications. With the new
environment, developers will be able to take advantage of both Java, and
portable assembler coding.
<P>
"Today we take the first step towards the future" Said Bill McEwen
President/CEO of Amiga, Inc. "The new Amiga SDK provides an environment
where the best developers in the world can build exciting applications,
that can transcend hardware limitations. Today Amiga developers can be
joined by Linux and Java developers in an environment that provides the
foundation for the delivery of future content."
<P>
"Tao has been talking for some time now about our developments to create
Digital Heaven® and we see Amiga and its community as a fundamental part
of the new order that can make it happen and take an industry lead. With
the sheer tenacity and the many qualities of McEwen and his Amiga team,
the world is going to see Amiga as a Premier Brand for connected digital
appliances," said Francis Charig Chairman of the Tao-Group.
For the developer, the new SDK creates a single environment that is
scalable from handheld devices, such as cell phones upwards New versions
of the kit later in the year will introduce many new media features. Both
the current and future versions will enable compact, high performance and
robust media solutions to be used across a broad range of devices using
identical binaries..
<P>
The New Amiga SDK is available through local retailers for $ 99.00, and
from the Amiga web site, Amazon.com and other sources available soon. A
version via a Japanese distributor will be announced shortly.
<P>
About Amiga:
<P>
Amiga Incorporated is dedicated to creating a multi-media operating
environment, enabling developers and users to experience a new level of
enjoyment.
<P>
As it was in the early 80's Amiga is ready to introduce the next level of
computing.

<P>
<B>CD³² Developer-Kit wieder verfügbar</B>
<BR>
Vor ein paar Wochen mussten wir das CD³² Developer-Kit
leider von unserer Homepage nehmen, da uns zum einen
der webspace-Platz gefehlt hat und zum anderen Gary Peake
uns zu aufforderte.
<BR>
Nun ist es wieder da, da wir zum einen wieder Webspace-Platz
haben und zum anderen Gary aufklärten das wir von Petro
Tyschtschenko die Erlaubnis zur Veröffentlichung erhielten.
<P>
<B>CD³²-Allianz besucht die Amiga-Messe in Neuss</B>
<BR>
Damit Ihr Kontakt zu uns aufnehmen könnt, werden wir
das Messe-Event in Neuss besuchen, dort könnt Ihr
dann mit uns über die Zukunft des CD³², über die
derzeitige CD³² Spielesituation, CD³²-Allianz
und die Zusammenarbeit mit amiga.topcool...etc
disskutieren. Darauf freuen wir uns am allermeisten.
<BR>
Natürlich werden wir auch versuchen, dort mit Firmen,
Händlern und Softwareprogrammieren in Kontakt zu treten
und hoffen Ihnen nach der Messe positive Neuigkeiten
präsentieren zu können.
<P>
<B>Neue Verbreitungswege für CD³² Outside gefunden</B>
<BR>
Nachdem die CD³² Outside demnächst auf der AmigaPlus- und
AmigaFuture CD-Rom zufinden sein wird, sowie im CD³²-Corner,
freut es und, das unser Magazin bald auch im Aminet und
auf den Aminet CD-Roms zu finden sein wird.
Demnach wird der Bekanntheitsgrad bei weitem erhöht werden,
was dazu führen sollte, das das Interesse am CD³² stetig
steigen wird. Was auch der CD³² Outside zu gute kommen wird.

APC&TCP veröffentlicht auf der Amiga-Messe in Neuss eine weitere CD-ROM.
Weitere Informationen sind auf unserer Honepage oder direkt bei uns
erhältlich. Nach der Messe wird diese CD-ROM wie alle unsere Produkte im
Handel sein:
<P>
 Willkommen im Kleiderschrank Ihrer neuen Workbench.
 Die neue "Digital Make-Up" CD ist eine Add-On-CD mit einer
 thematisch sortierten Ladung von Tools und Utilities zum
 Verschönern und tunen des Amiga-Betriebssystems.
 Hier sind nicht nur mächtige Werkzeuge versammelt, die
 das AmigaOS so richtig in Fahrt bringen und die tägliche
 Arbeit stark vereinfachen, - es wurde auch an Grafikmaterial
 für die alltagsgraue Workbench gedacht. Zusätzlich
 gibt es Software, um Sprachausgabe zu realisieren.
 Entsprechende Sprach- und Soundsamples in unterschiedlichen
 Formaten fehlen selbstverständlich ebenfalls nicht.
 Viele Datatypes, aktuelle Librarys, moderne Schriftarten,
 neue Befehle für das C-Verzeichnis und unzählige andere
 Systemerweiterungen bringen jedes Amigasystem auf
 den richtigen Kurs. Neue tolle Bildschirmschoner und
 viele Iconsets für das NewIconsystem, oder auch
 brandneue GlowIcons verpassen der Workbench ein
 modernes Aussehen. Zum Teil bisher unveröffentlichte
 Software finden Sie erstmals auf dieser CD-ROM.
 Dem neuen AmigaOS Version 3.5 haben wir ein
 Extraverzeichnis spendiert, wo die neusten
 Tools zur aktuellen Version zu finden sind.
 Einen Doppelklick auf "Quickstart" und schon sind Sie
 mitten drin - in der "Digital Make-Up CD" !
<P>
 Die "Digital Make-Up CD" ist optimiert für
 das AmigaOS Version 3.0 bis 3.5. Der Großteil der
 Software auf dieser CD-ROM läßt sich direkt aufrufen.

Das Fax mit der Mitteilung über die Flatrate von T-Online ist noch warm, da wartet NGI schon mit einer Überraschung auf. NGI bietet ab 1. Juni eine Flatrate für 77,77 Mark monatlich. Anders als bei T-Online beträgt die Mindestvertragsdauer aber nur vier Monate. Eine Anmeldegebühr gibt es nicht. Wenn man eine Kanlabündelung möchte, ist dies grundsätzlich möglich. Der zweite Kanal schlägt dann mit 2,49 Pfennig pro Minute zu Buche.  2,49 Pfennig ist auch der Preis, den NGI ab dem 1. Juni für sein Internet-by-Call-Angebot pro Minute verlangt. Der Premium-Tarif mit 9,95 Mark Grundgebühr  kostet dann sogar nur 1,79 Pfennig pro Minute.

AdOne bietet ab heute einen werbefinanzieren Internetzugang für 1 Pf/Min.
Während des Surfens wird in einem extra Fenster ständig Werbung
eingeblendet. Es gibt keine Grundebühr und keinen Mindestumsatz. Abgerechnet
wird über die Telefonrechnung.
<P>
Allerdings gibt es eine Einwahlgebühr von 99 Pf pro Einwahl bei einer
Verbindungstrennung nach 2 Stunden. So erreicht man selbst bei voller
Ausnutzung der 2 Stunden bestenfalls einen Minutenpreis von 1,825 Pf. Ist
man dagegen nur 5 Minuten online, kostet jede Minute umgerechnet 20,8 Pf!
Der Tarif lohnt sich also nur bei voller Ausnutzung der 2 Stunden bei jeder
Einwahl im Vergleich zu anderen Anbietern wie Freenet oder CompuServeOffice.
<P>
So kann der Tarif für "1 Pf pro Minute" schnell sehr teuer werden. Und für
die geringer Ersparnis selbst bei voller Ausnutzung der 2 Stunden (wenn man
Pech hat, kann auch noch die Verbindung vorher zusammenbrechen) extra noch
Werbebanner ansehen, sollte man sich nicht antun. Solange es die
Einwahlgebühr gibt, ist der Tarif für die wenigsten Internetnutzer
interessant.

gefaehrdet haben und es den zustaendigen Administratoren nicht
moeglich war, mit der Telekom zu einer Loesung dieses Problems zu
kommen, sah man sich gezwungen, am Samstag dieses Netz vom IRC

Innovative wird fünf Jahre alt! Seit fünf Jahren sind wir für den AMIGA®
tätig und haben ihn während dieser Zeit immer wieder mit unserer einmalig
innovativen und ungeschlagen preiswerten Software vorwärts gebracht. An-
lässlich dieses Jubiläums senken wir für einen Monat (einschließlich 21.6.2000)
den Preis für fxPAINT auf 109.- DM. Sie sparen 30.- DM!! Wenn Sie schon
länger vorhatten, die schnellste Bildverarbeitung und das Multitalent in
Punkto Grafik für den AMIGA® zu kaufen, dann ist das die richtige Gelegenheit!

Jetzt ist das Gästebuch endlich fertig! Können zwar noch kleine Fehler
drin sein, aber alles wichtige funktioniert prima. Das war jetzt mein
erster Perl Versuch :)
Dann haben wir neue Design Tutorials von Martin Kremecek bekommen und eine
Anmerkung zum Bitmapfont Tutorial von Thomas Praxel.
Nun sind die Bereiche Chat und Mailingliste im neuentstandenen Bereich
Szene aufegangen, dort werde ich alles Wichtige von Wettbewerben bis zu
Treffen rund um die deutsche Spieleentwickler Szene zusammentragen.
Das DSB Forum sollte jetzt auch wieder laufen, wenn Daniel und Mathias es
geschafft haben. Nochmals Entschuldigung, wegen dem langen Ausfall!
