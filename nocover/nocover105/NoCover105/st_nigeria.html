          <P>First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, which is of

          presently trapped in Nigeria.<BR>
          In order to commence this business,we need your assistance to enable us
          transfer funds into your account. As members of the Contract Review Panel
          set up by the Government of Nigeria to review all contracts from 1983 to
          the present,we have identified a lot of inflated contract funds which are
          presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment. By
          virtue of our position as Civil Servants and members of this Panel, we
          cannot acquire this money in our names, in this regard I have been
          delegated by my colleagues of the review Panel to look for an overseas
          partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of US$21,320,000.00
          (Twenty -One Million, Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand United Statesn
          Dollars) hence we take the liberty to write you.</P>

          1. 20% for you the account owner<BR>
          2. 70% for us (The Officials)<BR>
          3. 10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses.</P>

          <P>Please note that this whole process will take between 7 to 10 working
          days from the date of receipt of the following information by the above
          Email address or my confidential fax number 234-1-7597594. Your
          individual/Company's signed and stamped letterhead with a transcribed"Text"
          which we would send to you upon receipt of your reply with a letter of
          interest. The above information will enable us write letter of claim, and
          Job description by using your individual/Company name to apply for payment
          for the above stated amount. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter
          using the above Email address. Detailed information of this pending
          business transaction will be sent to you as soon as I hear from you.</P>
