September 5, 2002 - From the desk of Bill McEwen

Greetings to one and all:

I would first like to thank all of those that I had the chance to meet in 
Sacramento. While a short trip it was indeed great fun and real delight 
meeting with all of you and hearing not only the encouraging words, but 
also sharing in your concerns, desires, and dreams. We are looking forward 
to deliver on what we discussed with you.

When we purchased Amiga from Gateway there were many out there who said 
that we would fail. There were many out there who have worked against our 
efforts, and others that have misrepresented fact and manipulated 
privileged information in order to further their obviously self serving 
goals. There have been those who have wronged us, and caused us damage.

But, guess what? We are still here! We are still delivering! We are going 
to stay here! Amiga is about people, technology, excellence, we are a most 
tenacious people, and we have the community to prove it. Has it always gone 
according to plan? no. Have we made some adjustments to the plan? yes. Are 
we delivering on the plan? yes. Will we allow others to dictate our future? 
Absolutely not. Period..

Because of you, the Amiga dream lives, because of you, Amiga's are still 
being used throughout the world performing amazing tasks and activities, 
and because of you, we are still here and moving forward.

Amiga is a giant resting for the day of the fight, and gaining strength 
quietly, for, as we embark on this mission together, nothing will tear us 
apart.

Thank you once again for supporting us, and showing to the world that what 
was begun in 1985 was truly only the beginning.

Bill McEwen, and the Amiga Team


Amiga Club Members:
I would also like to take a minute and say a special howdy to all of the 
club members. It is really encouraging to see all of the activity and input 
from you with regards to the shirt design and name for the club. The "I am 
Amiga" name did not go over as well as I had thought, but in the next 
couple of weeks (after we get the ok from those who already have the name 
that was selected) we will all have the name and shirt design with which an 
be happy and proud to wear. Each member will receive their first newsletter 
in the next two weeks, and there will be all sorts of great announcements 
and information e, so look forward to it in your inbox.

As a reminder we will be having a new drawing for an Amiga Enabled Cell 
Phone in September, and we would encourage those of you who have not joined 
yet, to get in here and do so. We have many plans and activities coming up 
for the club, and once again for only $ 50.00 you will receive the 
newsletter, Shirt and other special promotions. The lifetime membership 
offer has ended, but we would encourage you to be a part of something 
really exciting as the members will continue to receive special discounts 
and exclusive programs directed at the membership. We will honor the 
"$50.00 off" certificate for the next members who join through the end of 
September, at which point we will hold the draw for the new cell phone.

September 1st, 2002:
As mentioned in Sacramento at AmiWest, we had offered amnesty to those 
people/companies/entities who have knowingly stolen our IP and used it for 
their own gains, or who have shipped product knowing that they are illegal 
had until the end of August in order for them to comply and to get legal.

Now, I am not going to mention names nor am I going to get into a public 
discourse on what is happening.. But legal action has begun. In the next 
two weeks papers will be served. We will target one violator at a time with 
the hope that we will send a very clear signal that this is very serious, 
will not be permitted and will be stopped. 

This is a private action between Amiga Inc, and those who wish to continue 
in this practice. While we announced publicly our intentions, the actions 
will be private. I am sure that everyone can understand this and I hope 
will support this.

AmigaOne Update:
Well, the amazing team of Eyetech and Hyperion are doing a great job. Many 
of you already have in your possession the AmigaOne boards, and many more 
of you have seen the hardware in action. This is indeed another major leap 
forward as we near the release of the new hardware and OS 4.0. Eyetech and 
Alan Redhouse have been doing a great job of keeping everyone informed of 
the progress, and we look forward to the products release.

AmigaOS 4.0:
Hyperion and the team are making amazing strides here. The screen shots 
that we all see and the updates from Ben and the people working on it shows 
great progress. I know that they are working hard with regard to the 
integration into the AmigaOne, and I for one am looking forward to seeing 
it all working together, and from what I hear we are not too far off from 
making that happen. With this stated we have received some more shots of 
the interface from the OS 4.0 team. You can see the new AmiDock screenshots 
here.


PDA/Cell Phone Update:
As mentioned in Sacramento the Amiga Anywhere Content Engine and associated 
content will be shipping on the new Sendo™ SmartPhone™ when it ships. Now, 
to answer the many e-mails that I have received about the Sendo phone…. I 
do not know when the device will ship commercially; it is out of our hands 
with regard to when they will have the phone available. I will tell you 
that before the end of the year we will be making at least two more Cell 
Phone announcements and at least two more PDA announcements. 

We are really starting to move on getting these business deals done and 
there will be many more opportunities for our developers to create new 
products for these cutting edge devices. 

A Possible New Product Offering - Let me know your thoughts:
In recent dealings with one of our hardware OEM's they offered an 
opportunity. 
This opportunity is for excellent laptop hardware at excellent prices. They 
would be dual boot systems with Linux/UAE, and Bernie Meyers product 
(formally known as Amithlon) pre-loaded on the device. Here is a sample of 
some of the pricing that you could expect, all prices quoted are in US$:

Intel&#174; 1.2GHz Celeron™ Processor, 256MB RAM, 15.0" TFT Active Matrix, 20GB 
Hard Drive, DVD Drive, Linux/UAE Ami*   $999  

Intel&#174; 1.6GHz Pentium&#174; 4 Processor, 256MB RAM, 15.0" XGA TFT Active Matrix, 
20GB Hard Drive, DVD/CDRW Combo Drive, Linux/UAE Ami*   $1579  

Intel&#174; 1.6GHz Pentium&#174; 4 Processor, 256MB RAM, SXGA TFT Active Matrix,  
30GB Hard Drive, DVD/CDRW Combo Drive, Linux/UAE Ami*   $1679  

These examples are notebook computers. There are other options available, 
but I am trying to find out how many of you would be interested in 
purchasing these through your local Amiga dealer. Let us know by sending an 
e-mail to interested@amiga.com. There are also desktops and other 
configurations but I think that a notebook Amiga would be compelling. Let 
us know.

The Product Formally Know as Amithlo*:
As mentioned before Bernie Meyers has a wonderful product, and we expected 
it to be out by now. However there have been a couple of delays, none of 
these are engineering driven, that has delayed the release. I can tell you 
that the new product will be out very soon, and will offer some new 
requested features, and from what I understand is really going to knock 
your socks off. We will have an update concerning the timing of this 
release and the new name very shortly. So contrary to what you may have 
heard, it will be available soon.

Developers:
This message is an update for you. You have created some of the greatest 
content that the world has ever known. Your skill sets and your tenacity 
have overwhelmed many, and everyday you become more and more important to 
the future. 

If you have been sitting on the sidelines I encourage you to jump in. We 
are getting requests from many of our OEM partners with regard to content 
that they are looking for on their devices.

While it has been a slow start (as is always the case in developing a 
market), this next quarter is going to see major movement, and 
distribution. We have many programs ready to take place for the Holiday 
season and we want you to be a part of it. So I encourage you to jump in 
make contact with us. Join us in creating the future.

In closing I wish to thank each and every member of the Amiga family for 
their support and good wishes in this amazing journey that we have embarked 
upon together. We are closer today than we were yesterday to the dreams and 
goals of Amiga. Tomorrow we will be closer again, and soon we can all share 
in the rewards.

Sincerely,

Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga Team«
