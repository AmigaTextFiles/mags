          <P>Willkommen zum sechsten Teil der Metallyrics !<BR>
           Heute driften wir mal ab in die wundersame Welt des
          J.R.R. Tolkien. Wer die Mammut-Saga "Herr der Ringe"
          kennen und lieben gelernt hat, dem ist sicherlich auch
          der indirekte Vorg&auml;ngerroman "Das Silmarillion" ein
          Begriff. Und genau dieses Werk haben sich 1998 die Mannen
          von "Blind Guardian" zur Brust genommen. Herausgekommen
          ist mit "Nightfall In Middle Earth" wohl eines der
          Highlights dieses Jahres, denn nicht nur musikalisch wird
          hier Abwechslung gross geschrieben, sondern die
          Romanvorlage ist lyrisch ebenfalls gut umgesetzt worden.
          Abgerundet wird dieses Album durch mehrere kleine
          "H&ouml;rspieleinlagen", wo die Story weiter voran
          getrieben wird - und, f&uuml;r all diejenigen die mit dem
          Silmarillion nichts anfangen k&ouml;nnen,
          Textausz&uuml;gen, die einen groben Umriss &uuml;ber die
          Geschichte geben.</P>

          <P>Dieses Album ist definitiv allen Schwermetallern zu
          empfehlen, die einen Fantasylastigen, epischen Heavy
          Metal bevorzugen und wegen leicht progressiven
          Einfl&uuml;ssen nicht gleich das totale Ohrenbluten
          bekommen. :-) Aber vorsicht: Wer auf leicht
          eing&auml;ngige Musik schw&ouml;rt, der wird hier mit
          einem Zentnerschwerem St&uuml;ck Granit vor dem Kopf
          gestossen, denn "Nightfall in Middle Earth" ist alles
          andere als leichte Hausmannskost, und z&uuml;ndet erst so
          richtig nach 5, 6 Durchl&auml;ufen. Dann aber gewaltig...
          :-)) Und immer dran denken: A Lyric Worth Reading Is A CD
          Worth Buying...oder so. ;-)</P>

          Storm</FONT></B></H2>

          <P>Give it to me - I must have it,<BR>
           precious treasure - I deserve it.<BR>
           Where can I run, how can I hide the silmarils ?<BR>
           Gems of twilight, their life belongs to me !<BR>
           Oh, it`s sweet how the darkness floating around...</P>

          <P>We are following the will of the one,<BR>
           through the dark age and into the storm.<BR>
           And we`re following the will of the one,<BR>
           Through the dark age and into the storm.<BR>
           Lord, I`m mean...</P>

          <P>Blackheart Show Me What You Hold In Hand,<BR>
           I Still Hunger For More.<BR>
           Release Me from My Pain,<BR>
           Give It To Me.<BR>
           How I Need It,<BR>
           How I Need It,<BR>
           Hoe I Need It...</P>

          <P>I did my part - now it`s your turn,<BR>
           and remember - what you`ve promised.</P>

          <H2><B><FONT color="#FF0000">Nightfall</FONT></B></H2>

          <P>No sign of life did flicker,<BR>
           in floods of tears she cried.<BR>
           "All hope is lost, it can`t be undone,<BR>
           they`re wasted and gone !"</P>

          <P>"Save me your speeches I know (they blinded us
          all),<BR>
           what you want you will take it away from me.<BR>
           Take it and I know for sure...<BR>
           ...the light she once brought in is gone forevermore
          !"</P>

          <P>Like sorrowfuls seaguls they sang:<BR>
           "We`re lost in the deep shades the misty cloud
          brought."<BR>
           (A wailing when beauty was gone - come take a lokk at
          the sky)</P>

          <P>Monstrous it covered the shore,<BR>
           fearful into the unknown.<BR>
           Quietly it crept in new horror, insanity reigned,<BR>
           and spilled the first blood, when the old king was
          slain.</P>

          <P>Nightfall,<BR>
           Quietly it crept in and changed us all !<BR>
           Nightfall,<BR>
           Quietly it crept in and changed us all !<BR>
           Nightfall,<BR>
           Immortal land lies down in agony !</P>

          <P>"How long shall we morn in the dark,<BR>
           the bliss and the beauty will not return.<BR>
           Say farewell to sadness and grief,<BR>
           though long and hard the road maybe."</P>

          <P>But even in silence i hear a voice:<BR>
           "An oath we shall swear by the name of the one,<BR>
           `til the worlds end...it cannot be broken..."</P>

          <P>(Just wondering how - I can still hear these voices
          inside,<BR>
           the doom of the noldor drew near.)</P>

          <P>The words of a banished king:<BR>
           "I swear revenge !"<BR>
           Filled with anger aflamed our hearts, full of hate -
          full of pride...<BR>
           ...we screamed for revenge !</P>

          <P>"Vala he is that`s what you said,<BR>
           then your oath`s been sworn in vain.<BR>
           Freely you came,<BR>
           you freely shall depart.<BR>
           Never trust the northern winds,<BR>
           never turn your back on friends !"</P>

          <P>"Oh...I`m heir of the highlord."<BR>
           "You better don`t trust him !"<BR>
           The enemy of mine - isn`t he of your kind ?<BR>
           And finally you may follow me...</P>

          <P>Farewell, he said.<BR>
           Back to where it all began.</P>

          <H2><B><FONT color="#FF0000">The Minstel</FONT></B></H2>

          <P>So i stand still in front of the crowd,<BR>
           excited faces, what will be next ?<BR>
           I still don`t have a clue...</P>

          <H2><B><FONT color="#FF0000">The Curse Of
          Feanor</FONT></B></H2>

          <P>Taken the long way, dark realms i went through,<BR>
           I arrived, my vision`s so clear.<BR>
           In anger and pain i left deep wounds behind,<BR>
           But I arrived, truth might be changed by victory.</P>

          <P>Beyond the void but deep within me a swamp of filth
          exists,<BR>
           a fake it was of crystal beauty but arda`s spring went
          by.<BR>
           I`ve heard the warning, well curse my name, i`ll keep on
          laughing...<BR>
           ...no regret, no regret.</P>

          <P>Don`t fear the eyes of the dark lord,<BR>
           "Morgoth", i cried,<BR>
           "All hope is gone but i swear revenge, hear my oath
          !<BR>
           I will take part in your damn fate."</P>

          <P>I will always remember their cries,<BR>
           like a shadow which covers the light.<BR>
           I will always remember the time,<BR>
           but it`s past, i cannot turn back the time.<BR>
           I don`t look back, there`s still smoke near the
          shore,<BR>
           But I arrived, revenge be mine.</P>

          <P>I will take part in your damn fate !<BR>
           "Morgoth", i cried,<BR>
           "it`s my oath, so don`t fear the eyes of the dark
          lord."</P>

          <P>Soon you will be free,<BR>
           set your spirit free.<BR>
           "Suddenly I realized the prophecies I`ve never believed
          in,<BR>
           my deeds were wrong, I`ve stained the land...<BR>
           ...and slain my kin, there`s no release from my sin, IT
          HURTS !<BR>
           THE CURSE OF FEANOR RUNS LONG...<BR>
           Time and only time will tell us tales: was I right or
          wrong ?<BR>
           When anger breaks through,<BR>
           I`ll leave mercy behind.</P>

          <P>I will always remember their cries,<BR>
           like a shadow they|`ll cover my life.<BR>
           But I`ll also remember mine,<BR>
           after all I`m still alive.</P>

          <H2><B><FONT color="#FF0000">Blood Tears</FONT></B></H2>

          <P>Welcome to my realm we are both condemned to live,<BR>
           it`s a dark fate (I can hear your calls), the eternal
          life !</P>

          <P>I see it still burns, each night I cry in pain.</P>

          <P>Alive - Through the end appears my friend,<BR>
           and blood tears I cry - you`ve searched and you`ve
          found...<BR>
           ...cut off your old friends hand.</P>

          <P>My mind`s in frozened dreams,<BR>
           the rotten flesh of bitter lies.<BR>
           Welcome to where time stands still,<BR>
           noone leaves and noone ever will.</P>

          <P>Can`t hold it, it burns - each night I cry in
          pain.</P>

          <P>And blood tears I cry,<BR>
           endless grief remains inside.<BR>
           And blood tears I cry,<BR>
           endless grief remains inside.</P>

          <P>It seems so clearly, bent the bow,<BR>
           cause life in me is gone.<BR>
           And a cruel winds blowing cold...and a cruel winds
          blowing cold...<BR>
           ...in blame.</P>

          <P>And life it shall wane - each night I cry in pain.</P>

          Mirror</FONT></B></H2>

          <P>Far, far beyond the island,<BR>
           we dwelt in shades of twilight.<BR>
           Through dread of weary days,<BR>
           through grief and endless pain.<BR>
           It lies unknown, the land of mine,<BR>
           a hidden gate to save us from the shadow fall.</P>

          <P>The lord of water spoke, in the silence, words of
          wisdom:<BR>
           "I`ve seen the end of all, be aware, the storm gets
          closer !"</P>

          <P>Mirror mirror on the wall, true hope lies beyond the
          coast,<BR>
           you`re a damned kind - can`t you see that the winds will
          change !?</P>

          <P>Gone`s the wisdom of thousand years,<BR>
           a world in fire, chains and fear.<BR>
           Leads me to a place so far,<BR>
           deep down it lies, my secret vision - I better keep it
          safe.<BR>
           Shall I leave my friends alone hidden in my twilight
          hall ?<BR>
           Knwo the world is lost in fire, sure there is no way to
          rurn it.<BR>
           Back to the old days of bliss and cheerful laughter,<BR>
           we`re lost in barren lands, caught in the running flames
          - Alone...</P>

          <P>How shall we leave the lost road ?<BR>
           Time`s getting short, so follow me !<BR>
           A leader`s task so clearly, to find a path out of the
          dark.<BR>
           Shall we dare the dragon ?<BR>
           Merciless he`s pisoning our hearts...</P>

          <P>Noldor, blood is on your hands,<BR>
           your bane`s a tearful destiny.</P>

          <P>Black clouds will carry rain of blood,<BR>
           I`ve seen it rain !<BR>
           We were lost on grinding ice, in fear and hunger,<BR>
           dead winter reigned in Araman !</P>

          <P>Can`t escape from my damnation,<BR>
           nor you run from isolation.<BR>
           Guilty spoke the one, this deed can`t be undone,<BR>

          <P>I know where the stars glow - sky`s unclouded,<BR>

          spirits,<BR>
           will grow old and weary.<BR>
           I`ve seen this bitter end as I`ve forseen,<BR>
           The storm and ice and I could see it:<BR>
           A MILLION DIED AND I ?<BR>
           The blame`s on me, caise i was not there.</P>

          <P>Dead winter reigns,<BR>

           See my eyes full of tears, and a cruel price we`ve

          <P>Immortal love is fooled by the hands of doom,<BR>
           that love means death, i realize too soon.</P>

          <P>Caught in the afterlife, I`ve gone too far,<BR>
           when sorrow sang softly and sweet.<BR>
           The air was filled with tears, full of sadness and
          grief,<BR>
           when sorrow sang softly and sweet.</P>

          <P>I feel like screaming, but I can`t breath in,<BR>
           Shall I wane right now ?<BR>
           I will not leave this world of living, `til she has said
          goodbye.</P>

          <P>Out in the cold I still wait for her call,<BR>
           and her last kiss it shall be release.<BR>
           I can`t forget her, her face will not leave,<BR>
           from the depths of my soul I long for her.</P>

          <P>So I heard all about it, her voice is so clear,<BR>
           she`s woven both themes in there, moved me to tears.<BR>
           The world shall hear this sad song,<BR>
           song of sorrow, song of greed.<BR>
           Can`t change the way of his kind,<BR>
           can`t change the way o her kind.</P>

          <H2><B><FONT color="#FF0000">Out On The
          Water</FONT></B></H2>

          <P>Out on the water, the island of the dead that
          live,<BR>
           there they dwelt until they left the world.<BR>
           Still there deeds live forth in songs...</P>

          <H2><B><FONT color="#FF0000">A Dark
          Passage</FONT></B></H2>

          <P>I feel cold, facing the darkness,<BR>
           the light is gone away.</P>

          <P>Deep in his castle he said:<BR>
           "All land will be mine, there`s one thing for sure,<BR>
           the triumph of shadow is near !"<BR>
           Deep in his castle they sang:<BR>
           "We shall not rest until all will be thyne !"<BR>
           "All land is mine, you can be sure, don`t dare me
          !",<BR>
           the mighty one screamed.</P>

          <P>"Smashed down the light, I will not rest `til I`m
          king,<BR>
           Valinor`s empty now, allied the elves and men,<BR>
           they shall be damned !"</P>

          <P>Rise of fall - a dark tale ends.</P>

          <P>just wondering how in the darkness they found their
          way...<BR>
           ...to the right place...<BR>
           children of the sun, second kindred...<BR>
           ...we call their race...<BR>
           treat them kindly...<BR>
           ...born in the east...<BR>
           are the nightfearer...<BR>
           ...they moved westwards...<BR>
           towards the sunshine...<BR>
           ...morning breath like...<BR>
           short`s their life...<BR>
           ...dawn passes by...<BR>
           when the day comes !</P>

          <P>The field was lost and hope passed away,<BR>
           sun went down, beyond the sea.<BR>
           Dark was the hour, but day shall come again.</P>

          <P>Clean my wounds, wash away the fear, let courage be
          mine !<BR>
           Noone hears me crying !</P>

          <P>No song, no tale, which contains all the grief,<BR>
           but renowned the deeds and the victims of defeat.</P>

          <P>"Sit down on your chair, look out for your kin,<BR>
           with my eyes you`ll see, with my ears you`ll hear !<BR>
           You`ve troubled my day and you`ve questioned my
          strength,<BR>
           don`t mess with the master of fate !<BR>
           I smashed down the light and dared Valinor,<BR>
           I smashed down the light, revenge will be mine !"</P>

          <P>Slowly we`re marching on...still we`re marching
          on...</P>
