/// From the Editor's Desk                        "Saying it like it is!"
    ----------------------


If all goes well, we'll have an in-depth look at the new CD32 in next
week's issue.  Someone in our user group is a registered CD32 developer,
and has received his unit.  It will be shown at next week's meeting, and
I hope to get some time with it.

Also, my good friend down in Florida is the proud owner of an Atari
Jaguar.  The game that comes with it (I think it's called Cyberdrome?)
is really neat he says.  I heard a lot of the sounds over the phone, and
the digital effects and speech sound really cool.

Word has it that Pagestream 3.0 has been delayed again.  The latest reports
indicate a release sometime in the first quarter of 1994.  I wish the folks
at Soft-Logik well, as this is an important piece of software for the Amiga.
We have so little truly professional software (aside from video and
animation), that something like this is very welcome.

The worst news is that AR will no longer be reprinting stories from
NewsBytes.  We had received permission from a NewsBytes representative on
GEnie back in April or May to reprint NB stuff at no charge.  Now that
appears to have disappeared, and they require a $50 per month publishing
'license' to use their work.  Since we are a non-profit magazine, we
cannot afford this.  I'm still paying $30-40 a month out of my own pocket
to run this, so it's just not going to happen.  I've tried to make it
apparent to the NB editor that we are non-profit, but they insist that
that would take away from their 'paying' customers.  For the record, sub-
scribers to GEnie pay nothing extra to use NewsBytes.  Portal users pay
$4 per month.  I don't know what their charges are on Bix or CI$, but I
doubt it's anymore than GEnie or Portal.  I hardly see how this could
add up to $50 a month, given that we just don't run that much of their
stuff.  Oh well, no great loss I guess.

    -----------------



           ** Atari's Loses $17.6 Million in Third Quarter **

   Atari Corp. reported Thursday a third- quarter loss of $17.6 million,
compared to earnings of $1.9 million, or 3 cents a share, in the year-
ago quarter.

   Revenues for the video-game company, which recently released its
leading-edge Jaguar game system, were off sharply to $4.4 million,
compared with $34.5 million in the 1992 quarter.

   Atari said the loss was substantially larger than expected, primarily
due to write-offs of $7.5 million of inventory of personal computers and
older video game products. It also incurred restructuring costs of $6.4
million from the wind-down of Australian operations and the decline in
value of company-owned real estate in Europe.

   Sam Tramiel, president, said the company is in the process of comp-
leting its transition from older technology consisting principally of
16-bit personal computers and 8-bit video game systems to the 64-bit
Jaguar, which began shipping last month.

   "While we are highly encouraged by the early sales of Jaguar, we do
not expect to achieve profitability until at least such time as ship-
ments of Jaguar are made in substantial volume," Tramiel said.

   The executive also said the company was working to resolve start-up
production and supply problems which led to delays in production and
shipment of Jaguar. He estimated the company will ship approximately 20,
000 Jaguar systems during the fourth quarter and 500,000 during 1994.

   Atari originally planned to ship 50,000 Jaguars to stores in the New
York and San Francisco areas before Christmas, then stage a national
rollout in January.


          ** Microsoft Called Nation's Most Innovative Firm **

   A Fortune magazine survey of nearly 1,000 senior executives in the 60
metro areas has named Microsoft Corp. as the most innovative company
operating in the United States. Microsoft received 39% of the votes to
lead the list of the 10 honored companies.


                   ** Toshiba to Boost DRAM Output **

   Spurred by a relatively strong demand for use in high-end personal
computers, Toshiba Corp.'s expects to increase it's monthly output of
16MB DRAM chips will be boosted to 2 million by the end of 1994. Cur-
rently the monthly production is just above 500,000.

   It is expected that the firm's output of 4MB DRAMs, currently around
8 million per month, will stay at that level.


                  ** Hitachi-TI Chip to be Shipped **

   A 64-megabit DRAM chip developed jointly by Hitachi Ltd. and Texas
Instruments Inc. will start sample shipments this month.  Plans are to
launch mass production of the new chip either in 1995 or 1996 depending
on domestic demand.


                ** TI Develops New Microcomputer Chip **

   Texas Instruments Inc. (TI) announced this week its scientists have
developed a new microcomputer chip that is capable of operating at room
temperature.

   Reports say that the quantum-effect chip, which once would only work
under extremely cold temperatures of minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit, is
said to operate over three times faster and hold three times more func-
tions than conventional chips.

   The new chip will only need a third of the transistors to provide the
same computing power as the current state-of-the-art semiconductor.


       ** Hitachi & Matsushita Develop Advanced Memory Devices **

   Hitachi claims that it has developed a significant single electronic
memory unit which can store 1,000 times more data than that of current
semiconductor memory chips. Matsushita Electronics has also developed a
highly integrated optical circuit device, which reportedly has consider-
able potential in multimedia devices.

   Some electronics firms, including Hitachi, have already developed a
single electronic memory. However, these existing single electronic mem-
ory devices should be used under temperatures at minus 273 degrees.  Un-
less the memory units are cooled down, the data is lost due to excessive
heat.

   Hitachi has overcome this problem by putting the electronic device
into a silicon container. As a result, this single electronic memory
unit can function in room-temperature. It is reported that the data will
not be lost even when the switch is turned off.

   Meanwhile, Matsushita Electric has developed an optical electronic
integrated circuit (OEIC), which has 64 units of semiconductor lasers
and a driver transistor. It is a two-tier structured IC, and the tran-
sistor is placed on the semiconductor laser.

   With this structure, each laser unit is controlled directly. As a re-
sult, the processing speed is increased almost 10-fold. The size of the
IC unit is just one third of a current IC.


          ** CD-Rom Interactive Training to Ship in January **

   Wilson Learning Corporation has announced it will begin shipping the
first of several CD-ROM-based interactive training programs for Macin-
tosh and PCs in late January.

   The company says the interpersonal, sales, and management skills dev-
elopment training programs are being developed in conjunction with Sony

Electronic Publishing Company. A total of 10 titles will be produced in
the joint project with Sony, while Wilson will also develop further
titles independently.

   The first programs, scheduled to ship January 24th, are "Connect for
Success: Connect With Others and Influence Them;" Sell to Needs: Sell
the Way People Like to Buy;" Relate with Ease: Build and Keep Interper-
sonal Relationships;" and "Decide For Sure: Add Certainty to Your
Decision Making."

   The first four titles to be released will be available through retail
outlets such as Computer City and Software, Etc at the suggested retail
price of $69.95.


         ** Prodigy, NYNEX Announce Electronic Yellow Pages **

   NYNEX said it will offer its 1.7 million business listings on the
Prodigy service next year and sell ads alongside those listings. The
companies said it is the first true electronic yellow pages offering,
including advertising, on an on-line service.


           ** Software Sales up 30%, Revenues Only up 16% **

   North American shipments of application software are up 30% over last
year, but, says the Software Publishers Association, "aggressive pricing
held revenue growth to a more moderate 16%."

   The SPA also says that leading the growth in the third quarter were
drawing/paint and desktop publishing programs.

   Breaking down the figures, the SPA says:

  -:- Windows applications still pace the industry, hitting $808 million
in the third quarter, a 70% increase from the same period last year. For
the year to date, Windows application sales totaled $2.26 billion, a 74%
increase.

  -:- DOS applications sales continued to decline, recording $471 mil-
lion for the quarter, and $1.46 billion for the first three quarters.
DOS sales were 26% lower for the third quarter and 22% lower for the
first three quarters compared with '92 sales.

  -:- Apple Macintosh software sales were $276 million for the third qu-
arter and $713 million for the first three quarters, up 11% for the qua-
rter and 7.4% for the three quarters.

  -:- Word processors and spreadsheets remained the largest categories,
with revenues of $219 million and $182 million in the quarter,
respectively.

  -:- Sales growth in the database category slowed from the previous two
quarters, as the product introduction blitzes of the first two quarters
ended. Database sales in the quarter were up 25%, to $108 million.

  -:- Drawing/painting and desktop publishing software were the fastest-
growing categories in the third quarter. Drawing and painting sales were
up 110% to $124 million, while sales of desktop publishing products were
up 106% to $67 million for the quarter.


           ** Apple Given Reprieve by Texas Commissioners **

   The county commissioners in Georgetown, Texas, this week reversed
themselves and voted 3-2 to approve a modified financial incentive pack-
age for Apple Computer. Last week, the board voted 3-2 against the pack-
age because of Apple's policy of giving health benefits the partners
of gay employees.

   The financial package grants Apple some reimbursements on taxes in
exchange for free right-of-way on future county improvements.  The tax
savings will help pay for a planned $80 million customer service center
that eventually is to employ 1,700 people.


                  ** N.J. Busts Alleged Credit Scam **

   Fifteen salespeople at a New Jersey car dealership have been accused
of using the credit records of more than 450 people to steal hundreds of
millions of dollars.  The 15 salespeople were arrested arraigned this
week on federal fraud and theft charges.

   Secret Service agent Peter A. Cavicchia is quoted as saying the
salespeople are alleged to have tapped into credit reports through their
computers, used the information to change the victims' addresses, and
then ordered credit cards and ran up charges. They also allegedly used
the credit information to obtain bank loans and cash advances.

   The dealership, Autoland in Springfield, N.J., alerted authorities
when they discovered unauthorized use of computer terminals.


             ** BSA Catches Firm Using Pirated Software **

   An audit by the Business Software Alliance found that Comptronix
Corp. Inc. was using unlicensed versions of software produced by Aldus
Corp., Autodesk Inc., Microsoft Corp., and WordPerfect Corp. The company
has agreed to pay $232,500 in penalties.


                   ** Novell Introduces Multimedia **


   NetWare Video 1.0, software to deliver multimedia audio and video
signals over PC networks, has been introduced by Novell Inc.

   Company officials are quoted as saying the software will enable its
NetWare customers to view and interact with multimedia information in
Microsoft Windows and will give multiple users access to audio and video
data simultaneously from a central server linked to networked computers.

   The product, which costs $1,100 for a five-user format and $2,975 for
a 25-user format, is the first to result from Novell's July acquisition
of Fluent Inc.

   Novell says it expects to have technology next year that will allow
live video information to be sent over the network, with video confer-
encing to follow.


                  ** Lotus Seeks Customer Feedback **

   Lotus Development Corp. announced today that it has established a
toll-free telephone line and a forum on CompuServe to receive sugges-
tions from customers regarding ways to enhance its products.

   The software publisher states that its toll-free line and the Compu-
Serve forum will complement other means the company has for gathering
customer ideas for review by product teams.

   Customers in the U.S. and Canada can call a toll-free number (1-800-
5MY-IDEA) to leave a phone mail message. The suggestions will be entered
daily into a Notes database and will be automatically routed to members
of the appropriate Lotus product team for review and consideration.


    ** Claris Claims 'Filemaker Pro' Easier to use than 'Access' **

   Claris is pleased to report its Filemaker Pro for Windows 2.1 out-
scored Microsoft's Access 1.1 for Windows in usability tests conducted
by Usability Sciences Corporation of Irving, Texas. While Claris commis-
sioned the tests, it says this is the second test in which its product
outdid Access, the other being a set of tests for ease-of-use conducted
by Software Digest/NSTL.

   The main claim Claris is making for Filemaker Pro for Windows is ease
of use.  In the Usability Sciences study novice database users were able
to complete an identical set of tasks 20% faster with the Claris product
than with Microsoft Access. The tasks were: creating a database, enter-
ing records into the database, querying the database, creating a form,
adding two new records into the form, adding a scroll bar to the record
field, and stamping a system date onto the form.

   While it took both groups of participants well over an hour to comp-
lete the tasks, participants using Access took nearly 17 minutes longer.
Study participants were intermediate PC users with little or no database
application experience.

   Claris the software subsidiary of Apple Computer, has cut the price
of Filemaker Pro 2.1 for Windows to $129, and is offering upgrades for
$20, and competitive upgrades from other database software products for
$99. A Macintosh version of the product is available for $399.

   Microsoft Access 1.1 is retail priced at $495, however Microsoft has
frequently offered the product for $99 since its introduction over a
year ago.


              ** Book Aids DOS Users With Wit, Cartoons **

   The latest book intended to make using MS-DOS easier to use and un-
derstand is a book titled DOS for Dummies written by Dan Gookin, part of
the MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade for Dummies package that also includes the MS-DOS
6.2 software.

   Gookin's book DOS for Dummies is supposed to be easy to read and a
gold mine for the millions of PC users who are secretly - and in many
cases openly - intimidated by PC software. "The book covers 100 percent
of the tasks users will be performing with their computers" according to
Gookin. He describes the style of the book as engaging, informative and
humorous.

   In addition to instructions on how to turn on the computer -- some
people actually have a problem finding the power switch -- Gookin
includes topics such as "Ten Common Beginner Mistakes," "Ten Things You
Should Never Do," and "After You Panic, Do This."

   So if your favorite computer user is willing to admit he or she is a
dummy, this book might be just the thing for the Christmas stocking. MS-
DOS 6.2 Upgrade for Dummies has a suggested retail price of $77.95.


                           ** Newton News **

   Apple Computer says it is launching the Newton Industry Association
at the first International Newton Development Conference being held this
week in Apple's home town of Cupertino, California.

   Apple says the Newton Industry Association is aimed at promoting gro-
wth and inter-operability of the Newton platform and associated devices.
Standards is another focus for the association in the areas of wireless
communications, telephone support, and office automation.

   One of the areas receiving attention right now is infrared communi-
cations between personal digital assistants (PDAs). Infrared standards
do not currently exist, meaning that even though the Newton Messagepad
and the Zoomer PDAs from Tandy and Casio both have infrared sensors, the
devices use conflicting standards. The upshot is Apple's PDA won't talk
to a Zoomer and vice versa.

   Apple representatives were unavailable to comment as to what the
company or the Newton Industry Association are planning to do concerning
standards.

   Apple listed beginning participants in the Newton Industry Associa-
tion as licensees, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), component
suppliers, and marketing partners. Companies represented included:
Alcatel, ARM, Bellsouth Mobilecomm, British Telecom/Cellnet, Cirrus
Logic, Deutsche Telecom, GEC Plessey, LSI Logic, Matsushita, Motorola,
Paragraph, Scriptel, Sharp, Siemens/ROLM, Telia, Toshiba, Traveling
Software, and US West.

   While the Newton has been well-received by enthusiastic users who
have snatched up 50,000 units since the product was launched in August,
reports from mainstream media have expressed disappointment and sharp
criticism for the PDA. It appears, however, that things may be turning
for Apple as four industry publications have awarded the unit top
honors. PC Laptop Computers Magazine called the Newton the "Most
Promising Portable," PC Magazine awarded the Newton MessagePad first
place in its "Design Category," Byte gave it the 1993 Byte Award of
Excellence, and Reseller magazine called it the "Best-To-Sell Products
of the Year."

   In new announcements concerning the Messagepad, Apple said Newtonmail
is expected to be available in a final commercial release throughout the
United States in January 1994. Newtonmail allows Newton users to ex-
change text messages easily with each other and anyone who can be
reached through online services available on the Internet and is cur-
rently available in a limited commercial release in the United States.
Newtonmail requires the Newton Fax Modem Card, a credit-card sized
Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) modem,
for communication via online services as well as the ability to send
faxes.

       ** Interactive CD-ROM Vietnam From CBS, Apple, NY Times **

   Joining forces with the formidable reporting resources and archives
of the New York Times and the CBS television network, Apple Computer
will publish and market "The Vietnam War" late in 1994. Chief reporters
on the interactive CD-ROM will be veteran reporter Dan Rather, anchor
and managing editor of the CBS Evening News, and R.W. Apple Jr., Wash-
ington bureau chief for the New York Times.

   Other Vietnam War-oriented CD-ROM publications have been available
for years from Quanta Press and Wayzata Technologies but these have been
more in the nature of archives of data related to the War. While they
are highly useful to historians and as reference materials, they lack
the immediacy of war reportage which the publisher apparently expects
this new disc to bring to the educational environment.

   The multimedia disc will include more than 700 news articles from The
Times and film and video from CBS News' archives. Maps, and even audio
recordings will also be included on the CD-ROM, along with the names of
US military personnel either killed or missing in action.


           ** Fast Real-Time Video Codec Board For Mac AVs **

   New Video, makers of the Eyeq series of video compression boards for
the Macintosh, have announced, what the company claims is, the first
compression and processing board for the Macintosh Audio/Visual (AV)
line of computers.

   The company claims its new Eyeq AV board will allow real-time, 30
frames-per-second (fps) full-screen video recording and full-screen
playback at the same real-time frame rate.

   New Video representatives said the Eyeq board has the advantage of
incorporating the Intel i750 chip for video compression and playback. It
is also claimed to be thousands of dollars less, at the retail price of
$1,895, than other video compression hardware add-on products.

   The board is specifically designed for use in the Quadra 840AV or
660AV and will interface directly with the AV's Digital Audio Video
(DAV) connector. It will allow for up to 16-bit graphics over video, 16-
bit stereo audio with a sampling rate of up to 48 kilohertz (KHz), sup-
ports displays up to 16-inches in size at 832 by 634 picture element
(pixel) resolution, and supports the most common video standards inclu-
ding NTSC (National Television Standards Committee), PAL, and SECAM
using the Macintosh AV's built-in Composite and S-Video out.

   The board is also fully compatible with Apple's multimedia software
extension Quicktime and most popular multimedia authoring tools, offers
resizable windows, software playback, and supports algorithms that
require an average of only nine megabytes (MB)-per-minute of hard disk
storage, company officials said. The board can also produce files with
data transfer rates that are low enough to play back from a compact disc
read-only memory (CD-ROM) drive over a local area network (LAN) in real
time with full-motion and full-screen size.

   The Eyeq AV requires a Macintosh Quadra 660AV or 840AV, any Apple
display up to 16-inches or any 832 by 634 pixel multisync display, a
hard disk drive with a recommended storage capacity of 200MB, 8MB of
random access memory (RAM) is also recommended, and the System 7.1
operating system.

TITLE

     DrChip C Utilities

VERSION

     1.02

COMPANY

     None

AUTHOR

     Charles E. Campbell, Jr. PhD
     email: cec@gryphon.gsfc.nasa.gov

DESCRIPTION

    The DrChip C utilities include four programs: a C beautifier,
    a function lister, a hdrtags/ctags generator, and a C program
    prototype <-> K&R-style converter.


    CCB

    Dr. Chip's C Beautifier program.  Places source code in Dr.
    Chip's preferred indentation style. ccb's indentation methods can
    be customized via options, even to the cb style (of U*IX fame).
    This program is useful for standardizing the indentation style of
    C programs, and helps make code more readable.  Furthermore,
    since ccb does its indentation based rigidly upon the number of
    open curly braces, it can be used to help the programmer find
    where a curly brace is missing.


    FLIST

    flist generates lists of functions from either C or C++ files.
    The lists may selected to be:

        comment block style
        extern style function declarations
        prototypes
        restricted to globally accessable functions
        restricted to locally accessable functions (ie.
         static)
        tags style

    Flist's tags mode is compatable with hdrtag (see below), and can
    merge hdrtags with tags.  See HDRTAG for more on tags.


    HDRTAG

    Hdrtags will process header files so one can "tag" to structure
    or class names, typedef'ed labels, #define labels, global
    variables, and enumerated types.  Entire hierarchies of header
    files can be tagged (ie. "include:" and all its subdirectories's
    header files)!  Use flist for merging hdrtags and tags files.
    Handles both C and C++ header (and source) files.  What's a tag?
    Smart editors (such as Vim and Manx's Z) support a "tags" file
    which associates words (such as function names) with a file and
    line to jump to.  The user can then issue "goto label" commands,
    avoiding the "what header file did that come from?" problem!


    TOPROTO

    The toproto program converts C source code to and from old K&R
    style to the new ANSI prototype-using style.  Concurrently, it
    converts to and from the old <varargs.h> style to <stdarg.h>
    style.


NEW FEATURES

    Several bugs were fixed, and better C++ handling was installed
    into flist and hdrtag.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    Compiled with Aztec C on an A3000 with the following options:
    CCOPTS=-qf -wp -c2 -f8. Thus, a floating point coprocessor may be
    required, although the code doesn't do much, if any, floating
    point.  The DrChip tools will work with any C compiler, although
    hdrtags' usefulness is limited to those editors which support
    tags (such as ViM, available on AmiNet, and Z, Manx's vi editor
    look-alike).

DESCRIPTION

     ToolType is an utility mainly for users who hate editing icon
     tooltypes using workbench.  ToolType will allow you to edit
     all of an icon's tooltypes at once rather that using the single
     line editor that workbench gives you.  ToolType extracts the
     tooltypes from the icon and lets you use your favorite text
     editor to edit them; it then will save all the changes back
     when you are done editing. ToolType has an added feature of
     sorting the tooltypes alphabetically if you want it to.  It
     can be started from WB, CLI, or set up as an appicon.  It can
     be setup to use what ever text editor you wish.

NEW FEATURES

    - Temp file will now be unlocked when ToolType is run more than once.
    - Fixed memory problem when using the appicon, Tooltype will now
      free the memory occupied by the tooltypes when you are done editing.
      Solves problem of ToolType adding extra tooltypes at the end
      when subsequent icon had fewer ones than the previous.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     - Only OS 2.x and up
     - A text editor

Just thought this might be of interest.... :)


Sb: #HP & Commodore Deal

I was just able to get a copy of this article, from EE Times August 6th issue.
It's an article about set-top-boxes ... those gizmos that go on top of your TV
to connect to cable (and who knows what else in the future).  Anyway, I
thought people here would find this interesting:


"Commodore International, which earilier this year launched the 32-bit,
graphics-intensive Amiga CD32 game machine, has signed a major deal to supply
HP with its high-performance graphics chip set, EE Times has learned.  HP will
adopt the Amiga CD32 architecture and employ the Amiga graphics chip set in
its first-generation set-top model.

"Jeffery Porter, director of product development of Commodore's technology
group, acknowleged that one of the terminal prototypes demonstrated at HP's
booth used Commodore's Amiga [chip] set.  HP officials declined to comment on
the prototype's architecture."

"Total Solution


"Commodore's strength lies in its ability to provide, today, a total solution
for set-top vendors, including a development platform for set-top
applications, a system architecture and a graphics chip set that can generate
35-ns pixel resolution, Porter explained.  What's more important, he said, is
price.  "Our CD32 game machine costs only $400, including CD-ROM drive. 
Without CD-ROM, our system can fit pretty nicely into a set-top price range.

"Commodore's custom Amiga chip set, originally designed for the company's
32-bit real-time multitasking OS computer, is composed of a pair of graphics
engines and an audio subsystem, assisted by hardware accelerators.  Using
Motorola's 14-MHz 68EC020, the machine produces what the company claims are
arcade-quality videogames".

Steve -

   One question, please.  What is a "first-generation set-top model"?  I'm a
little confused as to what a 'Set-Top' is.

To: Roy Pahnke 74316,254

A "set-top box" is what everyone with cable is going to have in the next
couple of years, replacing the current cable converters.  Basically, it's the
computer you'll use to help you access the new services -- displaying
information about what's playing on your 500 channels, ordering from
home-shopping channels, playing along with game shows, ordering
movies-on-demand, etc.

*** Subj: CD32 - Wow!

I walked into Intelligent Machines here in Orlando and they had a CD32 from
the Toronto WOCA show on display.  What a game machines, that floppy copy of
Jurassic Park jumped back onto the shelf!  I played ZOOL2, basically the same
game as my A1200 version with enhanced sound (full 16 bit audio for the
background sound) what a difference.  This machine will sell VERY well here in
the states, just as it is flying off the shelves in Europe.  CU Amiga had a
article on Microcosm, wow talk about a game! Pick up the mag and check it out
for yourselves.  They had 5 NTSC disks, all A1200 ports but still impressive
in comparison to the originals.

All you naysayers who wanted to see them on the shelves will shortly after the
CES show in Janurary.  Yes its after christmas, but there is still next
christmas....

My A1200 only gets productivity s/w from now on.  Games will be either CD32 or
CD32 ala the expansion port of the A1200.

                       "Computer chip worries dissipate"


  NEW YORK- The Semiconductor Industry Association declared Tuesday there was
no longer a need to worry about disruption in the supply of computer memory
chips.
   Prices for the chips rose sharply last summer <tell me about it!> after an
explosion and fire destroyed a Sumitomo Chemical Corp. factory in Japan
responsible for half the world production of a key ingredient in chips, 'epoxy
resin'.
  A module of three chips that represent 1 megabyte of memory cost dealers
about $33 before the fire. It rose to around $95 in late July and August as
speculation grew that production of memory chips would be slowed.
  Prices fell to the $40-$50 range this fall as those fears abated and reached
the $30 range as Sumitomo resumed production of epoxy resin.

/// European Outlook
    ----------------
    By Jesper Juul 
    (norjj@stud.hum.aau.dk).


Welcome!  This  is  an  irregular  column  with the intent of summing
up what's happening in the  European Amiga  World. My personal emphasis 
is on  Germany and  Scandinavia, so people everywhere else are welcome
to add or disagree.  My intention here is also that Amiga users
everywhere should be more aware of what Amiga users  everywhere else 
are doing.  Some of the things  said  are  slightly  old news and
backgrounds which I feel are overlooked but still interesting. Add to 
that a few slightly personal opinions. Mail me with comments, flames, or
other news worth noting.

The CD32 is currently 3500 DKR  in Denmark  (US$ 520), though in 
Germany  it  is  being  advertised as cheap as DM579 (US$ 340). The
first German advertisments of MPEG modules can also be seen, though
they're probably a little early.

National  television  (OK,  Denmark  only has _two_ channels) "DR" did
anews story on the CD32  a few  months ago, talking about  motion 
pictures  on  computers.  MPEG  (Bon Jovi) was shown, and the CD32 was
quite  favorably compared  to a 45000 DKR (US$ 6700) IBM which did 3 fps
flickering lowres "video". Very nice.

Also on Danish National television,  a  long-time  star  of a very
popular  Friday night  program called "Eleva2eren" is an Amiga 3000 and
agame  called  "Hugo".  This  is  a not-too- complicated little 
platform game, where viewers get a chance to win prized by controlling
"Hugo" via their phone. Children apparently love  it, and  there's
"Hugo" icecream, candy, and toys for them. The game has also been  sold
to  several other European countries, including Italy and Turkey.

Talking to  my local  dealer, it  seems that MPEG won't reach Northern
Europe before the  beginning  of  January.  Too bad. Expected price  is
1995  DKR (US$  300). The same dealer also carries  no  less  than   11 
CD32   games:  James   Pond  2, D/Generation, Trolls, John Barnes'
European Football, Whale's voyage, Morph,  Zool,  Sensible  Soccer, 
Mean  Arenas, Nigel Mansell's Grand  Prix, and  Arabian Nights.  They
are waiting for a new shipment of Pinball Phantasies.

In Germay,  MacroSystem is  advertising the  new VLAB digital video
board  with PAL/NTSC/SECAM  in & out, built-in genlock. A picture of the
board features a little chip saying "C-Cube" on top.  As you  may
remember,  this is the same company that does the CD32 decompressor
chips. The  video board  sells for DM1998, add  to that  a 16-bit  sound
board called "Toccata", and you end up at DM2600 (US$ 1520).

Emplant is finally getting a bad review, in the German "Amiga Magasin"
scoring  only 7.4 out of 12, mostly being blamed for being to expensive
compared to a new Mac. Obviously a  lot of people may  disagree, but  I
think  it's nice  to see someone being a bit critical to Utilities
Unlimitied.

Xpert is advertising the new Merlin2 graphics board.  The new one
includes  a special  "screen-in-screen" feature where you can mix
screens of varying depth on the  workbench. Video out is also  included.
A  1MB board is DM 648 (US$ 380), 16MB for DM 1698 (US$ 995).  In the 
new (AMAX  vs. Emplant)  style of making fun  of competitors,  Retina,
Piccolo,  and Picasso II users get unbelievably bad swap offers. Trade
in your Picasso II board for the huge sum of DM 200 (US$ 115)! Hmmm.

/// Compton MultiMedia Patent 5,241,671 -- THE CLAIMS
    -------------------------------------------------
    Brought to you by Matt Heffron
    (heffron@falstaff.css.beckman.com)



Here are the 41 CLAIMS of the of the Compton multimedia patent:

5,241,671  "Multimedia search system using a plurality of entry
            path means which indicate interrelatedness of
            information"

At least all of the arguments about it can be "semi-informed"
The patent filing date is Oct 26, 1989.  So if anyone is looking
for prior art, that's the date to beat.

(This came from scanning/OCR-ing/cleanup of a hardcopy of the patent.
It is quite likely that there are typos. beware. 
Formatting is approximately the same as the patent.)

I've cross-posted this to A LOT OF GROUPS... PLEASE be selective
with followups.  I included comp.client-server and comp.databases
because they seemed to be the most likely to have good database access
knowledge.  I included comp.groupware because it looks like much of
their systems could be covered by some of the claims.  comp.sys.xerox is
there because some of the claims look a lot like what I remember seeing
in NoteCards long ago; if so, it would constitute prior-art.  I hope the
other groups are more obviously relevant.

Also, when following up, edit quotes from the claims to the minimal amount
that you are commenting on specifically.  Please don't just followup with
the whole thing and a flame about patent office stupidity or some such.

The first paragraph looks like the
"Statement of Intent to Milk This for Everything We Can"  !

                         QmodemPro for Windows v1.0
                         ==========================



     Mustang Software unveiled the new Windows version of its popular
QmodemPro communications program during COMDEX/Fall '93. Called QmodemPro
for Windows v1.0, it is the first communications program to offer support
for both data and Fax communication in one integrated package.

     File transfers are supported using Zmodem, CompuServe B+, Kermit,
Ymodem, Ymodem/G, Xmodem/1K, Xmodem/1KG, Xmodem/CRC, Xmodem, or ASCII. A
built-in GIF viewer allows you to view GIF graphics files as they are
being downloaded.  You can zoom any GIF or BMP file, and even mark and
copy portions of the picture to the Windows clipboard.  Users can easily
upload files using drag-and-drop from the Windows File Manager to
QmodemPro's upload window.

     QmodemPro for Windows offers a wide selection of terminal emulations
including: ADDS VP60, ADM 3A, ANSI, Avatar, DG 100, DG 200, DG 210,
Hazeltine 1500, Heath 19, IBM 3101, TTY, TVI 910, TVI 912, TVI 920, TVI
925, TVI 950, TVI 955, Vidtex, VT 52, VT 100, VT 102, VT 220, VT 320,
Wyse 30, Wyse 50, Wyse 60, Wyse 75, Wyse 85, Wyse 100, and Wyse 185. BBS
callers will appreciate the addition of Doorway and RIPscrip to this
impressive list of supported emulations.  QmodemPro for Windows is the
first Windows product to offer support for RIPscrip, which is quickly
becoming the de facto graphics standard for bulletin board systems
worldwide, including Mustang Software's Wildcat! product.

     Besides offering full data communication, MSI has also integrated
both send and receive Fax support directly into QmodemPro for Windows.
Using any Class 1 or Class 2 Fax modem, QmodemPro for Windows can send
text files as well as PCX and BMP graphics files.  Cover pages can also
be attached to these documents.  Automatic Fax receive is also supported
and a complete Fax viewer includes thumbnail sketches, zooming, copying,
and printing.

     The phonebook allows you to view the dialing directory in a
traditional tabular form, or you can use the icon view mode to create a
true icon window of your online services, making it a simple double click
to dial, connect, and be online.  Each dialing directory entry can hold
up to five phone numbers, the default device, emulation, transfer
protocol, user ID, password, login script, RIP icon directory, and macro
file.  A note file can be attached to any dialing entry allowing you to
add your own notes and comments about the dialing entry.

     QmodemPro for Windows even allows you to review the scrollback
buffer while you're capturing information online.  You can customize the
terminal window using a variety of fonts.  The screen behind the terminal
window can be customized with your favorite pattern or wallpaper file
giving you full control of your desktop.

     Sporting a completely new Script Language Interface for QmodemPro
(SLIQ), QmodemPro gives you unparalleled power, speed, and flexibility.
Based on the popular BASIC language structure, it adds extensions for the
Windows communication environment and includes a Quicklearn feature for
creating scripts without having to learn the language.  It even includes
a compiler for compiling the scripts so they run faster and are more
secure.  A powerful script debugger and full editor are also included.

     QmodemPro for Windows allows you to take advantage of the Windows
multitasking environment.  Download files or capture data in the
background, while working in a word processor or spreadsheet.  QmodemPro
for Windows makes full use of the 16550 UART, Digiboard multi serial port
card, or any other intelligent serial interface with appropriate Windows
drivers.  Also supported are Interrupt 14 compatible LAN modems and other
devices.

     The newest member of the QmodemPro family now supports sound cards,
allowing you to assign standard Windows WAV files to certain events in
your communications session.  For example, you can have a WAV file played
when you connect to a BBS or when your download is completed.  There are
many events you can assign sounds to: connect, dialing, file transfer
success and failure, and many others.

     QmodemPro for Windows has a suggested retail price of $139.00.  This
product will be available within the next few weeks in the over 300
Software Etc. stores throughout the United States. Software Etc. has also
put QmodemPro for Windows on their "Reservation System" so your local

        As you can see, a fully assembled board can be purchased for $128.90
-- main board ($88.95), Agnus chip ($35.00), and Agnus extractor tool
($4.95) -- which is markedly cheaper than the prices I have seen advertised
in AmigaWorld Magazine (approximately $196.50 (US)).  Furthermore, you get to
support Amiga PD developers :-).  I purchased the NON-ASSEMBLED version with
parts and RAM option for $79.95, plus the Agnus chip and the extractor tool,
costing $119.90 in total (plus postage).


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                This project will work on all Amiga 500's, and all late
                model Amiga 2000/2500's.  This means that any Amiga 2000
                which has the older Amiga 1000 DIP-style Agnus will not work
                (i.e., those Amiga 2000's produced in Germany).

                It will not work on an Amiga 600, 1000, 1200, 3000, 4000 or
                CDTV.

                If you have an Amiga 500, you'll require an extra 512K RAM
                in the belly slot to expand memory.  If you intend to
                install the project in an Amiga 2000, then you should already
                have 1MB installed on the motherboard; and even if you
                currently have only 512K set as Chip RAM, instructions are
                included for the conversion.

                The following hardware is required for the conversion:

                1: If the kit is already assembled, then you require only
                the $4.95 PLCC chip extractor tool (definite requirement)
                plus the 2MB Agnus chip.

                2: If you purchased a non-assembled kit, the following is
                required to complete the installation:

                        - Any parts listed under "LIST PRICE", above, that
                          were not supplied with the kit.
                        - PLCC chip extractor tool.
                        - soldering iron.
                        - solder.
                        - flat blade screw driver (useful).
                        - X-Acto or similar knife.
                        - magnifying glass (optional, but very useful).
                        - multimeter (optional).
                        - tin snips.

                I presume it works with all faster CPU's.  Mine is currently
                very happy running with a GVP 22Mhz 68030 Combo accelerator
                board.  Note that if you have a board which covers the Agnus
                socket you may have problems, and should consult the
                documentation in the archive, or the authors.


        SOFTWARE

                None.


COPY PROTECTION

        None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        - Amiga 2000.

        - Initially, 1MB Chip RAM and 7MB Fast RAM.

        - Tested on Kickstart 37.175 (2.04) and Workbench 38.12.  Also booted
        up in Kickstart/Workbench 1.3 and everything appears OK (not fully
        tested).

        - Running GVP 22Mhz 68030 Combo board.  Works fine with hard drives
        attached to the SCSI bus. Set up has 2MB 16bit Fast RAM (A2058
        board) and 5MB 32bit RAM (Combo board).  GoldenGate II board also
        running with two extra PC serial lines.  CBM deinterlacer.  All
        appear compatible.

        - All software that I ran appears compatible.


INSTALLATION

        [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  If you are not comfortable opening up your
        Amiga, then you should have the work done by an authorized Amiga
        service center.  Careless work may damage the computer.  - Dan]

        The old Agnus has to be removed (and for this, the PLCC chip
extractor is an absolute requirement).  The new board is then inserted into
the motherboard socket left vacant by the Agnus chip, and a wire lead is
attached to a pin on the 68000 (I used the 68000 attachment, even while
running an 030) or the Gary chip.  That's it!

        The installation was dead easy, and the only worry was static
discharge from myself (I didn't use a static mat or strap... slap on wrist!
:-))


REVIEW

        The project assembly was much easier than I had suspected.  The
board is well laid out with everything clearly marked, and thus is of good
quality.  All boards come with the PLCC plug soldered to the board, due to
the difficulty of this operation.

        The assembly in its basic form consists of the following (note that
this only applies to the kitset boards):

        1) Solder PLCC socket to the PCB.  Not difficult, but it requires a
        little care and accuracy.

        2) Solder in the three SIP resistor packs.  Very easy.

        3) Solder in the nine capacitors into the board.  Very easy.

        4) Solder the clip lead to the board (already assembled on kitset
        boards).  Very easy.

        5) Solder the eight RAM chips to the PCB.  This was a little harder
        as I was worried about static and overheating the chips, and so it
        required a bit of precision and a speedy hand on the soldering iron.

        6) Solder the 24-pin PAL chip to the PCB.  Same skill level as above.

        7) Install the 2 Meg Agnus chip into the socket on the board.  Pretty
        simple.

        8) Install, as mentioned above in previous section.

        This process took me about an evening to complete (say 7:00pm to
1:00am... yes I was enjoying myself that much :-)).  But the work could
easily be split up over multiple periods, as recommended in the
documentation, to ensure that a high standard of work is achieved.  Mine
turned out pretty fair.  The soldering wasn't production line quality, but
is reasonably respectable.  I found it easier to solder the pins on chips,
sockets, etc., after they had been bent a few degrees (note I was *very*
careful doing this!).

        Note that none of the above applies to the complete, fully
assembled project, which arrives the same as the commercial products (with
the exception of the higher price tag).

        Overall, I obtained a great deal of enjoyment.  This was the second
board I have soldered (the first being the Multi-Kickstart, also produced by
Structured Applications and Designs), and found it much easier to complete
than the previous one.  Basically, if you can plug a soldering iron in, and
handle it with a small degree of proficiency combined with a desire to
produce work of a decent standard, you shouldn't have much hassle assembling
the project.  The instructions are a breeze to work through and provide a
step-by-step assembly and instruction method which is easily understood,
even by somebody as electronically inept as I am!

        Overall if you're not going to upgrade to a new Amiga, yet require
or would like 2MB of Chip RAM, then this is the cheapest path to achieving
your goal.  Don't be scared by the skill required to assemble the project or
the time taken to assemble it, as both are negligible.

        How useful is the extra 1MB of Chip RAM?  Well now I can multitask a
lot better, running numerous windows and doing a number of tasks that
previously I could not do (e.g., read my news with Grn, while downloading
with JRComm, while viewing IFF's).  It has turned me into a bit of a slob
though, as I tend to leave more windows open. :-)  It also aids those of us
that *have* to use MagicWB.


DOCUMENTATION

        This consists of the assembly, installation and compatibility files
that accompany the Public Domain archive on Aminet.  These ASCII files are
also accompanied by a number of IFF pictures which aid the assembly and
provide complete schematics for the project (i.e., PCB layouts, etc).

        The documents are superb, and provide a step by step description of
both the assembly and installation process which are easy to follow.  There
are even IFF pictures of parts which may be hard to identify for the
beginner (e.g., capacitors, chips, etc).

        Also included in the documents is an order form and description of
how the project works and the theory behind it.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        I believe that the project is brilliant!  It provides a cheap way to
upgrade your Chip RAM while introducing the beginner to a project which
provides a great deal of satisfaction and builds confidence (is this a good
thing with static sensitive electronics ;-)).

        I have no complaints about the quality of materials involved, the
documentation, nor the implementation of the whole project.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        The project is a Public Domain implementation of similar commercial
products available, such as the DKB MegaChip product.  I haven't used or heard
any complaints about the commercial products.


BUGS

        None known.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        I had to contact the authors, Neil Coito and Michael Cianflone,
several times via email concerning a delivery date.  Both times they were
helpful and courteous.  The problem was that new circuit boards were being
produced and delays had occurred.  The product arrived (after a delay in
Customs) at approximately the time specified by the authors.

        Both authors offer themselves in the documentation as available for
consultation if any problems are encountered.  Once the board arrived I had
no problems nor need to consult.

        I am not affiliated with the company in any way except as a
customer.


WARRANTY

        There appears to be no warranty.  It is mentioned in the documents,
that if a part is defective, then contact Structured Applications for help,
and I presume replacement parts are free of cost.  All the boards are sent
out fully tested, apparently.


CONCLUSIONS

        I consider the project brilliant, and hope that further projects of
this type appear for/from the Amiga community.  It is well executed in terms
of both documentation and hardware.  It achieves its aims, and appears to be
at least on a par with commercial products.

        If forced to give a rating, at this stage I would give it 4 out of
5.  The remaining star depends upon the long term reliability of the
product, which at this stage I have few doubts about.  If it stays as
reliable as it currently is, then I would happily recommend 5 out of 5!

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 · Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST

   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

/// Usenet Review:  Pinball Fantasies
    ---------------------------------
    By Steven Van Egmo
    (svanegmo@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca)



PRODUCT NAME

        Pinball Fantasies


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        Sophisticated pinball game simulator with 4 tables included.  Pinball
Fantasies is the successor to Pinball Dreams, by the same company.


COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           21st Century Entertainment
        Address:        P.O. Box 415
                        Webster, NY  14580
                        USA


PRICES (U.S. dollars)

        $39.95 list price.
        $24.95 street price.

        The above is for the 3-floppy version.
        A hard-drive-installable version is $10 extra.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                The documentation does not provide any information on this,
                recommending instead that all peripherals be disconnected.
                On a completely stripped 512K A500, the game intro would
                load, but no tables would.  On the same 500 with 1 meg of
                Chip RAM, the game worked fine.

                The hard drive version reportedly requires "about 4
                megabytes of [hard disk] space".

                The game will work with one floppy drive, but you need two
                to avoid disk swapping.

                The game works very well with a 68000.  With a 68030, the
                performance was identical, though the pause between the end
                of disk access and the start of a game was transformed into
                a BRIEF pause.


        SOFTWARE

                None observed.  The documentation provides no information.


COPY PROTECTION

        Disk-based.  High scores are recorded to the table disks, which must
therefore be write-enabled.  This may cause some problems (see BUGS, below).


TEST MACHINE

        Amiga 500, kludged to 1-meg Chip RAM.
        GVP A500-HD+ with 2 MB of Fast RAM installed; Quantum 52 Mb Drive.
        CSA Derringer 68030/68881 @ 25 MHz with 4 MB of 32-bit RAM..
        WorkBench 1.3 and 2.04.

REVIEW

        After becoming addicted to Pinball Dreams, I couldn't wait until
Pinball Fantasies was released.  21st Century Entertainment deserves
considerable praise for releasing a freely-distributable playable demo.  It
certainly convinced me to buy the game.

        The game consists of one boot disk and two table disks, each
containing two pinball games.  Included games are Speed Devils, Billion
Dollar Game Show, Stones 'n' Bones, and Partyland.  Unlike Pinball Dreams,
Pinball Fantasies allows one to purchase extra table disks and expand the
game indefinitely, though none are currently available.  This may even open
up the possibility of a table editor...

        The intro to the game is really slick.  It's not abortable, but it's
not annoyingly long either.  The music at first sounds vaguely creepy, but
eventually settles into a neatly sophisticated beat.

        The games themselves are extremely well-executed, and demonstrate a
higher level of sophistication than Pinball Dreams.  There are now 3
flippers on some tables.  The score panel, rather than simulating an LED
display, is now a dot matrix display that provides some really interesting
effects.  The tables are larger, and a ball that goes down the left gutter
can be saved by a "kickback" that lurks there on some tables.

        The simulation of the pinball action is excellent and feels as
accurate as ever.  No quirks at all appear in the ball behaviour, even after
long periods of play (this occasionally happened in Pinball Dreams).  Unlike
other pinball simulators I've encountered, Pinball Fantasies has implemented
the concept of ball spin.

        The design of the pinball tables is excellent.  Pinball purists will
complain that no simple, uncomplicated tables are present, as Ignition is in
Pinball Dreams.  Every table has a raised ball track; the one in Stones 'n'
Bones is more like a platform, where the ball can take different paths.
Every table is well-done, and I like them all.  Stones 'n' Bones is my
personal favourite.

        The graphics throughout the game are first-rate.  The dot matrix
display is fun to watch, and the detail on the board backgrounds is improved
over that of Pinball Dreams.  The graphics are, in some cases, too loud and
lend the board a cluttered look.  Billion Dollar Game Show is the greatest
sufferer from this -- when the ball is moving quickly, it's difficult to
tell where walls are as opposed to background graphics.  You get used to it,
though.

        The music is really good.  It's difficult to compare it to the first
version's music; my opinion of it improved the more I played the game.  It
still outclasses every other game I've seen for its sophistication.


DOCUMENTATION

        The package comes with a brief, unillustrated manual with about a
page and a half dedicated to each table.  The detail is impeccable, the text
is logical, and nothing is left out.  It's wise to have the pinball table in
front of you when looking at the manual, since some of the references to
objects are ambiguous.  Illustrations really would have helped.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        I like the graphics.  I like the sound.  I like the table designs.
I like the ability to purchase new table disks.  I really like the dot
matrix display, although one person who played the game said the size was
oppressive on the NTSC screen.

        I don't like the disk-swapping necessary for a one-drive setup.  On
bootup, it claims to make use of extra RAM, but I didn't notice any
difference in behaviour.  Also, it would be nice if the disks indicated
which games were on them.  Some people won't be happy about the $10
additional cost for a hard drive version, but I don't mind.


COMPARISON TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        This is a nice step up from Pinball Dreams.  The graphics are
improved, and the tables can do more.  The music and sound effects are just
as good, and will make anyone unfamiliar with the Amiga drool.


BUGS

        The disks, to AmigaDOS, aren't non-DOS.  If you leave them in when
you reboot, AmigaDOS tries to validate them, and gives up after 20 seconds
with an error requester.  I suspect this is what caused the high score
system to become defective on my disks -- all high scores were unchangeable
and unreadable.

        I requested, under warranty, a replacement set.  They fixed the
problem, but only temporarily.  One of the 2 game disks seems to have gone
bad again and refuses to save high scores.  Very annoying.

        I recommend you make sure to remove your disks from the drive when
you reset, or write-enable them only when the high scores need to be
re-written.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        When my disks went bad, I contacted 21st Century Entertainment by
mail for a replacement set, which arrived about 10 days later.  I was
surprised they didn't ask for the return of my old set, which I have since
formatted.  I was pleased with the support.

        The warranty covers disk defects and lasts 90 days.  Make sure you
write down the number that's printed on your warranty card before you mail
it.

CONCLUSIONS

        This game is an excellent pinball simulator and a whole lot of fun.
It's a first-rate Amiga game all around.  I'm glad I got it.

/// The Night Before Christmas - Modern Times
    -----------------------------------------
    Author Unknown



        It was the night before Christmas, and one thing was clear
               That old yuletide spirit no longer was here.
          Unemployment keeps rising, the crime rate is tripling;
              'Boomers elected, and our taxes are crippling;

             I poured some Jack Daniel's as I watched the TV,
                 Where Donny sang "O Holy Night" to Marie
           The kids were in bed, getting sleep like they should,
             Or else they left home, which was almost as good.

             My wife, with her ball-point, was making a fuss;
           About folks we sent cards to, who'd sent none to us.
          "Those ingrates", she thundered, and pounded her fist,
         "Next year you can bet they'll be crossed off our list!"

               When out in our yard came a deafening blare,
          'Twas our burglar alarm, and I hollered, "Who's there?"
           I turned on the searchlight, which lit up the night,
             And armed with my handgun beheld a strange sight,

            Some Red-Suited Clown, with a white beard immense,
              Was caught in my eight-foot electrified fence;
            He called out, "I'm Santa! I bring you no malice!"
              Said I, "If you're Santa, I'm Telly Savalles."

               But, lo, as his presence grew clearer to me,
               I saw in the glare that it might just be he!
              I called off my Rottweiler, clawing his sleigh,
             And frisking him twice said, "I think he's okay."

              I led him inside, where he slumped in a chair,
               And he told me the following tale of despair,
            "On Christmas eves past I was jolly and chuckling,
            But now 'neath the pressures I fear I am buckling."

           "You'll note I've arrived with no reindeer this year,
            And without them my sleigh is much harder to steer;
              Although I would like to continue to use them,
               The wildlife officials believe I abuse them."

              "To add to my problem, Ralph Nader dropped by;
               And told me my sleigh was unsafe in the sky.
             I now must wear seatbelts, despite my objections,
          And bring the sleigh in twice a year for inspections."

              "Last April my workers came forth with demands,
               And I soon had a general strike on my hands;
                 I couldn't afford to pay unionized elves,
              So the missus and I did the work by ourselves."

               "And then, later on, came additional trouble;
               An avalanche left my fine workshop in rubble,
            But my Stallstate Insurance was worthless, because,
          They had shrewdly slipped in a 'No avalanche' clause."

                 "Then, after that, came an I.R.S. audit;
              The government claimed I was out to defraud it.
                   They finally nailed me for 65 grand;
          Which I paid through the sale of my house and my land."

              "And yet I persist, though it gives me a scare,
           Flying blind through the blanket of smog in the air;
         Not to mention the street gangs, who fill me with dread,
              Taking shots at my sleigh as I pass overhead."

          "My torn-up red suit, and these bruises and swellings,
              I got fighting muggers in subsidized dwellings.
              And if you should ask why I'm glowing tonight,
              It's from flying too close to a nuclear site."

           Then he arose from his chair and heaved a great sigh,
          Though I couldn't help notice a small tear in his eye;
            "I've tried", he declared, "To reverse each defeat,
               But I fear that today I've become obsolete."

            He slumped out the door, and returned to his sleigh
              And with these final words he went his own way;
               "No longer can I do the job that's required,
             "I'm going to call Clinton and try to get hired."

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.

BIX is divided into areas called conferences, each devoted to a 
particular area of interest.  They range from algorithms to windows,
from writers to amiga.  Conferences are categorized into groups,
usually referred to as exchanges, so that you can browse through
whatever groups interest you and see a list of the conferences it 
contains.


                  These are some of the exchanges on BIX:

amiga.exchange - the place for Amiga developers and enthusiasts
byte - the full text of each issue of BYTE magazine; source code too 
e.and.l - Entertainment and Leisure; music, pets, games, more
ibm.exchange - everything from OS/2 to PC clones
mac.exchange -  Mac news, support, software, advice
professionals - consultants, engineers, financiers gather here
programmers - some of the best brains in the business!
wix - the Information Exchange for Windows; Windows Magazine online
writers.ex - the professional and amateur writer's exchange


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX also features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription.

                          POWER PC - SNEAK PEEK!
                          ----------------------


                      Mac Report PowerPC Sneak Peek!!
                      ===============================



PDM

Code named PDM, the bottom of the line PowerPC Mac has a 60mhz PowerPC
601 chip. Priced at around $2000, it has 8 megs of RAM and a 160 meg (or
230) hard drive and comes in a Quadra 610 type box. A built-in CD-ROM is
an option.

Carl Sagan

Next in the line-up is the "Carl Sagan" (who thinks up these code
names?). With a 66mhz 601, a 230 or 500 meg hard drive, 8 megs of RAM
three NuBus slots and an optional CD-ROM  drive in a Quadra 650 type
case. Price? Around $3000

Cold Fusion

Top o' the line "Cold Fusion" is based on an 80mhz 601. Priced at around
$4000, it comes in a Quadra 800 type box with 8-16 megs of RAM, a 230 or
500 meg hard drive,  and a CD-ROM drive.

Look here for more PowerPC info in the weeks ahead. If you've been
reading this column for a while, you know that I'm really pumped up about
CD-ROM, so here's some more CD-ROM PR.

        Knowledge is not truth

        Truth is not wisdom

        Wisdom is not beauty

        Beauty is not love
